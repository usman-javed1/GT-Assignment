Chauri sahab has applied ointment and bandaged it too. Wow brother, wow, mother should take care and son should apply ointment. Well, in a way, it is good too. This wound is also very important. Only when the old wound heals, we can give it again. Where has this happiness gone? I had gone to leave that mad person somewhere, but the poor Muslim was left behind there. Not in the homes of small people. Chaudhari sahab has come home now, he is sitting in the tent. Well, when he is done with his guests, then send him to me. I have to talk to him. Now you go and listen to him. Increase Anna's troubles as much as possible, so that your loneliness can also increase. Thank you, Charani ji. I don't know Murad putra, when will you be lucky to wear this wedding dress. Amma is looking at my wedding dress, will she do it without asking me or me? I am not so lucky that I can marry you according to my wish. Murad putra, if you agree, then I will marry you off in a  I will get it done in a day, well she will get me married in a day with the same girl who is coming to the jail with two tractors, the girl whom aunt Gulzar had shown the proposal, make fun of me, make fun of me I have only one wish, that before I die, I see a wedding garland on your head, then it will be fine, your wish has been fulfilled, have you seen any girl, I am telling the truth, you just have to go now to see the proposal, where, where you had gone before, where did you go to uncle Khuda Baksh's house, Murad son, are you not crazy, you can see only that house in the whole village, there are other houses also, only Khuda Baksh's house has daughters and no one else has daughters, Mamma, they are the best people in this whole village, yes, yes I know they are very good people, the father commits murder and the daughters serve the sentence, my son has suffered the punishment with them without any reason, there is no need to get a proposal in their house, earlier you used to like Anna, now Shado, there is no other girl, do you stay at one place or not, see Amma, first Unna's helplessness came in the way Chaudhary is taking undue advantage of this and is in the affair of another [sangeet] I will not allow this oppression to happen to another [sangeet] I will not let any injustice happen to any other girl, shame on you, you have been very helpful, Amma, once on my request, go and talk to uncle Khuda Bakh, I am sure in the house of Allah, he will not refuse, Amma, and do not do anything wrong in the future, okay, as you say, my dear Amma, my princess, you have not even kept this properly, bring it, I will give that to him too [sangeet] I am very sorry, your hand is injured, otherwise today I would have pressed my feet on you, you would have remembered your status, now heal them quickly and tell me what lesson are you teaching my son, that Chandni ji, that is the lesson of his books, now take a lesson from me also, if you teach any lesson to my son against me or my family members, then I will affect you in such a way that you will not be scared of Chaudharys, who have seven generations [Music] Now why are you standing and looking at my face, get out of my sight [Music] And no Baji, don't talk to your sister with such respect Now this much cruelty is not right now Bakhtawar go, what has happened to you these days you are showing so much mercy on the enemies You even saved that mad man from my hands I came to know that you had taken Anna to meet his father and sister And today you even went to drop that mad man to his home And now I will have to say that this much cruelty is not good [Laughter] [Music] No now Baji ji jaan your father never made a cheap deal [Music] I thought that my wife has a big hatred for the killer's car owners For revenge there is only one Anna I was thinking why not bring the second Anna also in this car Then take maximum revenge from them How is it Bha Veera you will have to give a slap to the people Well you are creating an atmosphere but your wife will not let this happen My old lady of the Chaudhary race will be here so she will not let it happen, right  She is not here at all You made the first move and I remained a spectator What a move you made Wow But I will make the next move Keep doing as I say and remain a spectator And if this second move of ours succeeds then see the whole community will be forced to say Kaka now this much oppression is not right O Wali son you have become very naughty Well listen to me now you did not even go towards Anna Baji and did you understand even going out Yes well done my son Assalam Walekum Khuda Bakh Para how are you Walekum Assalam O Shado Shamo come look Kausar has come well done Alam Walekum Khala how are you You sit down Khala make tea for you Hey let it be let it be There is no need for tea Sit down why do you not need tea It is your brother's house it is your right Khuda Bakh brother You are saying the right You are never empty handed [Music] Turn my biggest wish was that Anna would become my daughter in law But fate did not let her We tried to forget all this, understanding it to be the decision of fate Khuda bakh bhai I have once again come to this place for this very purpose Namaste what do you want to say Uda bakh bhai I am Chaniya Shad my daughter-in-law [Music] What are you saying Kausar pan Shadu's marriage with Murad what will people say that earlier the elder daughter's marriage was being arranged and now the younger daughter's marriage is being arranged though I do n't care about what people say but I am also not able to understand this thing Khuda bakh para what is there to not understand in this people make relations with their sisters-in-law even after their wives die May Allah give life to Khadana khwasta Anna she is not dead her marriage has happened out of helplessness otherwise she would have been my daughter-in-law Bhai sahab sisters and daughters are the same Khuda bakh para please remove this misconception and give me the date of Shad's marriage now [Music] you brother sahab what is there to think in this if one thinks then one goes where there is a stranger and Kausar pan you have put me in a strange test of thinking  We need time Bhaisahab Murad is your child and you are still asking for time to think about it [Music] Okay Para you think about it I will come again [Music] My Lulu's love [Music] Sajan My Lulu's love Sajan Shad Ab was not aware of this and he was not mentally prepared either, that is why he has asked for time for this relationship Aunt Kosar did not refuse No Shamu Abba's tone was of refusal only You may agree or not Shamo I am telling you again Abba's intentions are towards happiness only Shammu Anna Baji has sacrificed a lot for us and if I get married there Shamu Anna Baji's sacrifice will go in vain Shado you are right I will also go and talk to Abba [Music] What mother Uncle has asked for time You will be happy, your heart will be satisfied Amma go for my sake You have gone for your sake I got the reward Amma I doubt this uncle has done this out of fear of the Chaudhrys  You must have done it because of something, you must have been compelled to do it Murad putra, I think, but God, the car owners have cast a spell on you, you speak in their favour every time and they treat you the same way every time, enough is enough now, either you give me a car or let me see it, Amma, you are not understanding what I am saying, well then today either you make me understand or you understand what I am saying, Abba, what have you done [sangeet], for Murad bhai's marriage, you asked for time to think, that Murad bhai to whom you were ready to give your dearest daughter, you were ready to give half the price of the tractor and you asked for time for his marriage, oh son, I considered Murad as my eldest son-in-law, now how can you give him the marriage of the younger daughter, well, if you ask the truth, I have no complaint against Murad, it was his mother who took advantage of our helplessness and demanded half the amount of the tractor, now if she demands something again for the marriage of the younger daughter, then what will I do son, I will have to face a new test  I will not be able to do it and if they do not demand the tractor, then we will decide according to that time. Abba, because of your decision at this time, Shado is crying and in a very bad state. And why is she crying? Shado, her father is still alive. Call him. O Shado, Shado son, come here, my son, come here to me. Son, what happened? Why are you crying? You no longer trust your father. Son, parents do not take any wrong decision for their children. I am already very upset because of Anna. Now I do not want to take any wrong decision in a hurry again. That is why I have asked for time from the Chaudharis and also from Murad's mother. [Sangeet] Chaudhry sahab, you have promised me twice. You have neither given me animals nor are you giving me my money. You are not fulfilling your promise. [Sangeet] Oh, look brother, you had made this deal with my brother-in-law, late Chaudhry Hashmat and I was not present at that time, but still I had agreed to give you animals. And if I refuse, then you cannot touch even a hair of mine, nor will you have any excuse for this.  There is proof, right? You can prove it. In this way, a case of 400B will be filed against you. If a case of 400 is filed, you cannot do that. Then let's do this. We will take you to the same person with whom you had made the deal. We will settle the matter face to face. Chaudhary sahab, you are not doing well. You are being too harsh. I will kill you all. Now, so much cruelty is not right for such a small thing. [Music] No, look brother, you have come to my camp, that's why I am leaving you. And till now, you are not going up and complaining about me to Chaudhary Hashmat. Now, you can go. Yes, there is no need to come again. But if the arrangement for the animals has been made, I will get the cattle fed myself. Otherwise, your Naseeb sahab, you are being too harsh on me. Let's get up. [Music] Guddu son, and how is your maid teaching you? And I mean that Anna, your Ustani ji, Anna ji is teaching very well and she is very nice. But Amma, why do you speak so badly with her? The mistake is of her father.  But why should Anna ji be punished [Music] Guddu There is only one Anna for revenge I was thinking why not bring another Anna as well in this car She should do as I say [Music]
