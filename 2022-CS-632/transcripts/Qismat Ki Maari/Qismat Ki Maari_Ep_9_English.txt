Your relationship with the Chaudharis does not work out or they do not want to form a relationship with you, so I have a relation. There is a Dita butcher in our village. He is a little old and he is lame in one leg too. [Music] If you say so then I will talk about Shado's marriage. [Music] It will be a good relation for him. Pahan Kausar, you have told me your decision and I listened to it quietly and came away. Now do not add to my troubles, you do not have daughters, how would you know what the pain of daughters is.
