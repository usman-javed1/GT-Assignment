Alisher 's eyes opened and he ran away from there. On the way, some people bumped into Murad. Murad tried to catch them, but they ran away. Meanwhile, Alisher came there and mistaking Murad for a prisoner took him to the camp. Oh, I am dead. What are you saying? Alisher doesn't know that my Murad is not like this. What will he do with those people? I will go myself. You do this. Go to uncle Khuda Bakh's house, talk to him. Alisher will not listen to him. Yes, I will go myself. [Music] [Music] Oh, it's about the cow. You had gone to take the cow. Chaudhry sahab was also there. We had even opened the cow. But Alisher's eyes opened and he was forced to go. On the way to leave, he bumped into a man like Murad. He took the gun and shot him. Thankfully, I reached the spot. I had a pistol and a gun. If you are about to shoot someone, it won't be long. Alisher reached there with his gun.  Ali Sher did not stand up and the other person is on the run Ali Sher thought that he was a thief and took him with him If Murad opens his mouth, he will not do what he wants to do Ali Sher did not believe me Ali Sher is sure that I am not going to tell you anything This is very good news my name will not come out and all the blame will be put on Murad [Music] Oye I had also promised to give the dung Let me do something You do one thing You disappear from this place for two-three days [Music] Go, I will take care of the rest ok sahib go out [Music] Wow what a thing it is our fault We are also the thief and the culprit Murad and happiness we are so much oppression is not right [Music] Come on now speak out Abba your cap was mine Abba Abba always the stick gets stuck you son what are you doing right now take out one pair from the new clothes that you had stitched for the wedding and get it ready I have to go somewhere Abba wherever you have to go I also said no, come let's get down, I have to go to a special place, now I know the menu, you have to go to Anna Baji's car, I have to meet Anna Baji, no, son, I have to go somewhere else, Abba, please take me, I wo n't tell Shammu and Bali, for sure [Music] promise, first of all, you are very stubborn, okay, I will come after praying, then we will make a plan [Music ] Oh, who has come, Allah, well, I will see [Music] Some robbers had come to Jabba Ui Ali Sher's tent, Murad was watering his fields there for farming, so he ran, he also ran after them to catch them, so he ran, but he has taken my child to the tent, you are saying something about him, what do you mean, he took him away, he didn't get killed, you know our Murad, it's not like that, what does he have to do with the letters, if you say so, I would also come with you to the tent, and no, no, but I will go there after praying, and then leave, you don't worry and I will bring Murad back, you take him home, my child is innocent, he  Don't file a case against him, put him in jail and how can you hand him over to the police like this, you don't worry, I am here, I am going right now and I will bring it at night, thank you brother, La Cha is being made, go and drink it son, nothing will go inside from my side until my Murad comes back, pray for him [Music] I am going for him [Music] yes [Music] Tauba Tauba Tauba Anna Sahiba, the one who is your sahab's fianc√©e, she has done a great deed, sir, what is her name, yes Murad, she has a very deep connection with Ali Sher, Astagfirullah, what Chaudhary sahab, Murad along with his companions tried to steal the cattle from Ali Sher's enclosure, his companions ran away but he has been caught, Murad cannot steal, that too, uncle You have some misunderstanding about Murad and [Music] thief, now even this much oppression is not right, this is correct, it is confirmed that Haley Sher has caught Murad and it is possible that he may also be handed over to the police, will his respect remain?  Tauba Tauba Tauba how is it possible he himself is a very responsible person and eats well, have you got any misunderstanding what is the need for him to steal he is a landlord and also eats and drinks [Music] but he is a decent person I cannot say anything about him otherwise what was the need for Ali Sher to hold him uncle Ali Sher [Music] what was the need for him to steal tell me the truth tell me Murad and who else was with you uncle Ali Sher the sad thing is that you are doubting me and you are right Murad friend Ali Sher what has happened to you he is our own child Murad grew up in front of us and he also moves around with decent people let's accept it let's accept your words too Khuda Baksh but I have seen him with my nails talking with those guys when I shouted thief thief then everyone ran away hearing the noise and uncle Ali Sher he had hidden his face and kept a grinder on my temple and was telling me that if you make even the slightest sound we will kill you  Come on, I would have got into a fight with him My mother's face came in front of my eyes If something had happened to me, what would she have done Behind me, if I had seen her, I would have told her Oh, I understand, look friend Ali Sher, in today's times no one swears on his children, but I swear on Murad that whatever he is saying is absolutely right [Music] Now leave it, it should not happen that he gets defamed in the community There, sister Kausar is also upset at home I had promised her while coming that I will bring Murad Now leave this matter, we will see for ourselves that which person has tried to steal, God bless and you have done a great favor to me, that's why I am leaving him [Music] Go, come son, your kindness [Music] [Laughter] [Music] O Allah, protect my Murad, help him, what are you thinking, Allah will do good [Music] By the way, let me tell you one thing, this Ali Sher has not done any good, even if there was a duck in his enclosure, then how could he have saved Murad  Why did you take me along with you in doubt? What is this? Who told you after saying Bismillah? Who should have told me? I myself was going for a walk after offering my namaz in the morning. His tombs told me. And brother, Khuda Bakhsh, he has gone safely. He must be coming to pick him up. And you don't worry, Gulzar sister, you go to different places. It's your kindness. Don't tell anyone. Oh, what are you saying? Kausal, why would I tell anyone? It's a matter of our house. I am not a child that I should go to different places and tell from house to house. It's not my habit to put pressure on each other. Look, those people came. You were getting worried like this. Khuda Bakhsh brother, thank you very much. Sister, what is the big deal in this? Your son and Murad, I also have a son, right? By the way, Murad, who were those people? I have a doubt, rather I am sure that they must be the men of the Chaudharis. It's not necessary that they were uncles. They could be from the nearby community as well. If my mother hadn't made me swear, I would have removed the mask from the faces of the Chaudharis.  All right, son, I am leaving now. Actually, I had to go for some important work, but God forbid, do n't sit down. You will have tea before leaving. And no, sister, there is no need for this. Allah Hafiz, no, no, God forbid, brother, you will have tea before leaving. What's the matter? You will sit and drink tea after saying Bismillah [Music] Amma Jaan, what are you doing? Anna ji had arranged my books so nicely. You have spoiled them. No, son, you will get well again. Anna ji has taught me very well today and I am very happy today. Oh my son, your happiness is above all else, but I cannot tolerate that Anna is happy. Rajjo, Rajjo ji, the queen, today you are not well. I am fine. I told you that you are unwell. So, it means that you are unwell. Okay, go and call Anna. Okay, so this means that the maid has made the Sahib happy. Yes, [ __ ] [Music] Oh, my golden son, I will sacrifice myself for you. Look, what are you doing? Hold on, but what is the need for this?  You may not need it but your family will need it, right? Send it to them. Today my son is very happy. I keep sacrificing my life for his happiness. [Music] And you should keep him happy. Being a maid, it is his right to keep him happy. But you should also keep one thing in mind. If you try to assert your right over this, then I will usurp your right. [Music] And listen, Rajjo is unwell today, so you will do her share of work too. Go and cut the fodder for the buffaloes. [Music] Why are you looking at my face? Go and take her away. [Music] Come on son, come let us meet my grandfather. [ Music] I am saying, sir. Salam. Sir. Well, God, how did you get in the way. Sir, we had come to meet our daughter. If you permit, uncle. Why are you embarrassing us? She is your daughter. What is there to be permitted in this? [Music] Well, now why should you show so much arrogance, uncle? And the fact is that she is my elder sister?  No, yes, Chaudharani ji, after the murder of Chaudhary sahab, he developed a strange kind of hatred towards you people. Don't feel bad, you are sitting inside in the drawing room, I will bring Anna. Okay, okay, no, yes, thank you very much. No, no, uncle, it's a great kindness of yours. [Music] Please hurry up [Music] O Anna, give me the rope, give me the rope. Now this much of oppression is not right, Chaudhary sahab, you are the sister of this car, it's our duty to take care of your rights. And the thing is that your father and he came to meet you wearing your cute little girl and made me sit in the tent. I go and meet him. Chaudharani sahab will feel bad, you don't agree, I am here, I will take care of you. You go, you commit the mistake and listen to me, no one should know about his family. Go, go, cut. Well done [Music] Ho [Music]
