[396.12] Anna was saying, he hasn't even eaten food. May Allah bless him
[404.76] and why is Abba's face hanging low. I was getting
[413.52] married thinking that my daughter's life should not pass, but
[419.80] this marriage has ruined my Anna's life.
[422.68] This is not a marriage.  This is oppression
[432.40] Abba, should I not bring food son, I am not hungry
[443.08] Abba, after the morning prayers, you went straight to
[446.24] pick up Murad Bhai
[448.52] After that, you and Shado are coming back now
[452.64] and you are not feeling hungry Oh son, hunger is
[456.60] not related to delay, it is related to the peace inside Abba, is
[461.68] everything alright, you look quite worried
[466.64] Oh son, ever since that accident happened, there are problems
[471.48] everywhere It
[475.80] seems as
[478.44] if problems have taken over our house
[483.32] Abba, what has happened,
[485.56] nothing,
[488.08] son, I want to be alone for some time
[499.80] Leave me alone [Music]
[504.64] Abba, it's fine
[511.89] [Music]
[531.24] Anna went to Baji's house
[533.42] [Music]
[537.20] Chatrani again told me that
[541.72] Chand Rani was
[545.04] not there Khash had arranged a meeting with Baji,
[549.20] so this is a matter of happiness What is there to worry about in this, the
[555.04] worrying thing is this
[558.13] [Music]
[559.40] Yaado, the man Baji is married to, he is a 12-
[563.96] year-old boy,
[578.16] Nawaz's life has been ruined The
[583.28] Chaudharis took such a big revenge in the bloodshed
[591.44] Apa even killed one of their family  I knew
[596.36] he was giving me a hard time
[601.41] [Music] Oh
[607.00] God, when will this series of rituals end?
[615.84] Then only will we have to go through this series of trials
[622.41] [Laughter]
[629.00] [Music]
[654.36] Today you can make the fake
[657.48] lions and doors as strong as you want. It is
[662.40] very important for the people
[667.64] inside to be strong. Murad is the
[674.72] one who has tried to harm
[677.60] you. He is the same
[680.88] person inside. Who told you about it?
[685.36] We also live in this village and we are keeping an eye on the news. We have
[691.72] our doubts but
[697.80] I don't believe it is a theft. This man
[701.56] Murad promised me that he will
[705.20] bring the animal in two days
[707.24] and it is another matter that maybe he did
[711.00] n't
[713.24] take the chance. By the way uncle, you shouldn't have left Murad
[717.68] and if such an incident happens tomorrow, then
[721.56] you can't even make a claim. It
[724.52] was my duty to
[727.12] tell you. The rest is
[730.64] up to you. If you don't believe it, then
[733.96] ask this man what wrong has Murad said.
[739.96] Ask him why is he looking at me
[751.35] [Music]
[757.70] [Music]
[765.60] Why not,
[770.92] this is enough for today. Come and have your food.
[783.66] [Music]
[809.76] Anna ji, why are you crying and why are you not
[813.04] eating food Anna ji, tell me, you take so much
[817.28] care of me, you teach me, in this regard, it is
[821.20] also my duty to take care of you, please
