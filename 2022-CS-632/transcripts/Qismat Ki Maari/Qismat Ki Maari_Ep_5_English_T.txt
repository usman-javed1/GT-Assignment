[594.68] What happened Khala Jaan Ali Sher  Some
[597.24] thieves had come to the camp to steal the goods. Alisher
[601.12] 's eyes opened and he ran away from there.
[603.64] On the way, some people bumped into Murad.
[605.84] Murad tried to catch them, but
[608.20] they ran away. Meanwhile, Alisher came there and
[611.32] mistaking Murad for a prisoner
[614.08] took him to the camp. Oh, I am dead. What are you saying?
[617.64] Alisher doesn't know that my Murad is not like this.
[621.92] What will he do with those people?
[625.80] I will go myself. You do this.
[628.28] Go to uncle Khuda Bakh's house,
[630.04] talk to him. Alisher will not listen to him.
[633.72] Yes, I will go myself.

[666.68] Oh, it's about the cow. You had gone to take the cow.
[671.60] Chaudhry sahab was also there. We had even opened the cow.
[676.16] But Alisher's eyes opened and he was forced to go.
[682.64] On the way to leave, he bumped into a man like Murad. He
[687.64] took the gun and shot him. Thankfully,
[693.68] I reached the spot.
[695.48] I had a pistol and a gun.
[699.32] If you are about to
[702.48] shoot someone, it won't be long. Alisher
[708.48] reached there with his gun.  Ali Sher did not stand up and the other person is on the
[716.20] run Ali Sher thought that he was a thief and took him with him
[723.32] If Murad opens his mouth, he will
[727.80] not do what he wants to do Ali Sher did not believe me
[734.52] Ali Sher is sure that I am
[739.92] not going to tell you anything
[749.44] This is very good news
[751.96] my name will not
[754.48] come out and all

[1146.12] correct, it is

[1153.80] possible that he may also be handed over to the police, will
[1158.36] his respect remain?  Tauba Tauba
[1164.08] Tauba how is it possible he himself is a

[1178.29] [Music]
[1180.24] but he is a decent
[1183.72] person I cannot say anything about him
[1187.64] otherwise what was the need for Ali Sher to hold him

[1198.09] [Music] what was the
[1206.80] need for him to steal
[1210.20] tell me the truth tell me Murad and who else was with you

[1228.92] friend Ali Sher what has happened to you he is our own
[1232.40] child Murad grew up in front of us
[1235.68] and he also moves around with decent people let's accept it let's accept your
[1242.04] words too Khuda Baksh but I have
[1244.36] seen him with my nails talking with those guys
[1247.88] when I shouted thief thief then
[1251.00] everyone ran away hearing the noise and uncle
[1255.68] Ali Sher he had hidden his face
[1258.20] and kept a grinder on my temple and was
[1260.84] telling me that if you make even the slightest sound we will
[1262.60] kill you  Come on, I would have got into a fight with him
[1265.28] My mother's face came in front of my eyes If
[1268.88] something had happened to me, what would she have done
[1271.44] Behind me, if I had seen her,
[1274.56] I would have told her Oh, I understand, look
[1279.08] friend Ali Sher, in today's times no one
[1282.32] swears on his children,
[1284.48] but I swear on Murad that
[1288.28] whatever he is saying is absolutely right
[1290.83] [Music]
[1292.08] Now leave it, it should not happen that he gets defamed in the community
[1296.04] There, sister Kausar is also upset at home
[1299.84] I had promised her while coming
[1302.52] that I will
[1305.04] bring Murad Now leave this matter, we will see for ourselves
[1308.84] that which person has tried to steal,
[1311.32] God bless and you have done a great
[1315.64] favor to me, that's why I am leaving him
[1321.42] [Music]
[1330.24] Go, come
[1333.56] son, your kindness
[1339.05] [Music]
[1342.09] [Laughter]
[1343.57] [Music] O
[1359.00] Allah, protect my Murad,
[1362.64] help him,
[1366.24] what are you thinking, Allah will do good
[1372.21] [Music]
[1375.16] By the way, let me tell you one thing, this Ali Sher has not
[1379.12] done any good, even if there was a duck in his enclosure, then how could
[1382.32] he have saved Murad  Why did you take me
[1384.80] along with you in doubt? What is this?
[1387.16] Who told you after saying Bismillah?
[1390.80] Who should have told me? I myself was
[1393.60] going for a walk after offering my namaz in the morning.
[1395.88] His tombs told me. And brother, Khuda
[1399.92] Bakhsh, he has gone safely. He must be coming to pick him up.
[1402.40] And you don't worry, Gulzar sister, you go to different
[1406.40] places. It's your kindness. Don't tell anyone.
[1409.24] Oh, what are you saying?
[1411.44] Kausal, why would I tell anyone? It's a matter of our house. I am not a
[1414.32] child that I should
[1416.56] go to different places and tell from house to house. It's not
[1418.76] my habit to put pressure on each other.
[1425.64] Look, those people came.
[1429.44] You were getting worried like this. Khuda
[1434.88] Bakhsh brother, thank you very much.
[1438.48] Sister, what is the big deal in this? Your
[1441.88] son and Murad, I also have a son,
[1446.60] right? By the way, Murad, who were those people? I have a doubt,
[1451.88] rather I am sure that they must be the men of the Chaudharis. It's
[1456.96] not necessary that they were uncles. They
[1462.20] could be from the nearby community as well.
[1469.56] If my mother hadn't made me swear, I would have
[1473.04] removed the mask from the faces of the Chaudharis.  All
[1478.28] right, son, I am leaving now.
[1482.36] Actually, I had to go for some important work, but God forbid, do
[1485.24] n't sit down. You will have tea before leaving. And no, sister, there is
[1488.52] no need for this. Allah Hafiz, no, no, God forbid,
[1492.52] brother, you will have
[1495.08] tea before leaving. What's the matter? You will sit and drink tea after saying Bismillah
[1499.77] [Music]
[1514.96] Amma Jaan, what are you doing? Anna ji had arranged
[1519.20] my books so nicely.
[1520.88] You have spoiled them. No,
[1524.28] son, you will get well again. Anna ji has
[1527.28] taught me very well today and I am very
[1529.28] happy today. Oh my son, your happiness is above all else,
[1535.36] but I cannot tolerate that Anna is happy.
[1543.40] Rajjo, Rajjo ji, the
[1546.28] queen,
[1551.88] today you are not well.
[1556.12] I am fine. I told you that you are
[1561.00] unwell. So, it means that you are unwell.
[1566.92] Okay,
[1569.76] go and call Anna.
[1579.04] Okay, so this means that the maid has made the Sahib
[1583.24] happy.
[1588.68] Yes, [ __ ]
[1592.37] [Music] Oh,
[1604.80] my golden son, I will sacrifice myself for you.
[1619.04] Look, what are you doing?
[1623.64] Hold on, but what is the need for this?  You may
[1627.44] not need it but your family will need it, right?
[1632.08] Send it to them.
[1634.36] Today my son is very happy.
[1638.56] I keep sacrificing my life for his happiness.
[1641.41] [Music]
[1645.60] And you should keep him happy.
[1648.96] Being a maid, it is his
[1653.84] right to keep him happy. But
[1660.08] you should also keep one thing in mind. If
[1663.44] you try to assert your right over this, then
[1667.12] I will usurp your right.
[1670.92] [Music]
[1673.32] And listen, Rajjo is unwell today, so
[1677.00] you will do her share of work too.
[1680.96] Go and cut the fodder for the buffaloes.
[1682.44] [Music]
[1684.84] Why are you looking at my face? Go and
[1689.16] take her away.
[1698.11] [Music]
[1701.28] Come on son, come let us
[1708.84] meet my grandfather. [

[1741.40] embarrassing us? She is your daughter. What is there to be permitted in this?
[1750.71] [Music]
[1753.52] Well,
[1755.68] now why should you show so much arrogance,
[1758.56] uncle? And the fact is
[1763.96] that she is my elder sister?  No, yes,
[1765.96] Chaudharani ji,
[1768.28] after the murder of Chaudhary sahab, he developed a strange kind of
[1772.16] hatred towards you people. Don't

[1816.96] O Anna, give me the rope,
[1825.32] give me the rope. Now this much of oppression is
[1829.88] not right, Chaudhary sahab,
[1832.76] you are the sister of this car, it's
[1835.68] our duty to take care of your rights. And the
[1841.16] thing is that your father

[1858.40] agree, I am here, I will take
[1862.28] care of you. You go, you commit the mistake and
[1869.32] listen to me, no one should know about his family.
