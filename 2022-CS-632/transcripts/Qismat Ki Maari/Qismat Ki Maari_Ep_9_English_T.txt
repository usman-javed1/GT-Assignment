[644.84] made a ring for you. Give me
[647.48] your hand. This is not the way to go.

[666.72] yes, remember, bring your hand here,
[673.44] Shia, what are

[681.16] time of the rooftops, we have no compulsion, we are
[685.16] respectable people, you should go from here, this
[693.08] worthless man is throwing Chaudhary Khursheed out
[696.92] of his car, I
[699.92] gave you respect, ask for a marriage with respect, otherwise what
[704.04] guts did you have, I should take your daughter away by force, there is no

[813.72] Friend son, to end Anna's troubles and to
[819.72] end this enmity, I had agreed to
[823.76] marry Shado to the Chaudharis,
[826.84] but today he came in my absence
[831.60] and caught hold of Shado's hand.
[835.80] I reached the spot, I tried to
[839.24] explain to him, but instead he caught hold of my collar
[842.94] [Music]
[844.36] and threatened me a lot, friend, let me
[849.36] tell you one thing
[852.32] uncle, only a person who has his
[855.44] own respect can keep respect, and
[858.92] respect cannot be bought with money, yes people can definitely be
[862.00] bought,

[868.44] son,
[870.36] I will not get my second daughter
[872.76] married to such cruel people,
[875.92] Friend uncle, my mother had come to
[879.00] talk about the relationship, but you
[881.56] asked for time,
[883.16] and if you think that I am
[886.88] worthy of this relationship, then finalize the relationship,
[889.60] oh son, your mother had talked to me,
[893.72] now I will go and talk to her,
[901.92] okay,
[904.72] keep it, okay uncle, now keep it
