God forbid, if you ever experience a bad situation, I will be standing by your side stay blessed dear, may God bless you with a lot of happiness don't know what do I say while being emotional alright then uncle, I shall take your leave now as I have to distribute the wedding invites too ok dear, lets go oh God! you have served me such a bad drink by the way sister, heartiest congratulations to you! after all, you have fulfilled your son's contumacy by fixing Murad's marriage with Anna oh sister, what shall I tell you? By the way, I felt so disappointed. It wouldn't have been any harm if you would have told me about it Gulzaran, what shall I tell you? anyways, your son's wedding got fixed as per his choice & as per your choice but you could have told me at least, what was the harm in telling me? oh Gulzaran, don't you worry. You will get a new dress & sweetmeats for sure yes! A new dress & sweetmeats. I will take money along with two new dresses the money & the dress is alright, but tell me what will you get? I won't get anything, but Murad will get some amount for the tractor amount for the tractor? I didn't get it I have informed Brother Khuda Baksh that Murad is buying a tractor for his field, so please assist him then, did he help you? Did you get the money for the tractor? A tractor is a very expensive thing, & Khuda Baksh doesn't have that much amount Fine! then he shouldn't give any money. Find some other family who can help us to buy the tractor oh wow! this is great You didn't inform me about it, but as I was passing by Khuda Baksh's house, I heard the sound of drums beating the girls were singing songs about marriage I felt like laughing, as their brother is special so how he will make arrangement for the wedding? Right?
By the way, whatever you have said now is really good stay firm on it, I have great proposals for your son. He doesn't lack any quality though also he is not so aged yet, but why were you in such a hurry? ok, do one thing if he doesn't give you money for the tractor, then I will show you another proposal just find a good proposal for my Murad stay firm on your words
I will! what? half amount for the tractor what are you saying, Khuda Buksh? I had said "yes" for Anna's happiness on your basis now I am worried since that time that how will I arrange such a hefty amount this is the discussion between men if Tufail had been alive today, then the matter wouldn't have reached to this extent his wife is unable to understand anything hmm...
right? she should have talked to you after seeing your stature, anyways don't worry I will personally talk to sister Kulsoom Okay I will sell off my land but... it cannot be sold so quickly I will sell it off after getting free from the wedding oh Khuda Buksh, I promise you. I will help you for sure Anna is not only your daughter but mine too but... tractor is a very expensive thing my brother but man, I cannot refuse now ok Khuda Buksh don't worry, you know I have a cattle business and I honestly don't know the prices of these tractors get the price of a tractor, then we'll see what needs to be done brother Ali Sher, thank you so much! Soon I will return your money after getting free from the wedding Oh man, that's another matter. First, check how much expense this wedding will incur so that we can arrange that much okay, I am leaving now. Thank you so much okay, bye! bye! who is it? its me, Murad who? Anna, this is me Murad but dad is not at home I had an idea that uncle won't be home actually I wanted to meet you & discuss an important matter with me? yes, with you Anna, look, I know our marriage is fixed and it's not appropriate for me to come here like this, but... its very important to discuss the matter that's why I had to come actually I was about to tell uncle in the morning that he shouldn't worry about my mom's demand which demand? about the money which money? I wanted to buy a tractor for my fields and I am collecting money for it so when our marriage got fixed then My mother asked your father to give some money for the tractor but dad didn't tell me any such thing but now I have understood that why he was so worried I am guilty Anna, my mother's demand is not right And I don't need any money from uncle Anna, you are my life's biggest desire I just want you, nothing else and Anna, I will arrange the money & give it to you. You may give that money to my mother but my dad won't agree also I won't agree Anna, don't you like me? I do but not more than my father's self-respect so I swear upon your life Anna, I won't let uncle's self-respect get harmed at all I will go and explain to Mom that she should end this matter of money for the tractor you shall explain your mother to retract the condition regarding the money. if she won't step back then I will step back from this marriage No Anna, don't do this I cannot even imagine about it oho! what happened! God forgive me. What shall I tell you & what not here you are doing the wedding preparations & putting lace on the clothes you are doing full wedding preparations & there... there your son, before the marriage
oho! What shall I tell you & what not? oh God! What are you saying? What happened to Murad? I saw with my own eyes that Anna was hiding behind the door and whispering something to Murad and our Murad was standing nearby & answering her They were standing so close to each other as if they were lovers or something similar I couldn't see that, oh God forgive me Already I was not happy with this proposal oh sister, think in a calm manner. Whatever you did, you did with your own will Otherwise, I had plenty of proposals from girls who would have offered large dowries, including cows and buffaloes now bear it, since you have done it as per your will what I could have done, Murad wasn't agreeing I am suggesting you like a sister, there is still time. Handle everything my work is to make relations But I must say, Auntie, you seem to break off more relationships than you make oh God dear, what are you saying? whatever you heard. I saw you in front of uncle Khuda Buksh's house myself you were looking at us as if we were doing something wrong You were in the wrong! The way she saw you, someone else could have seen both of you the same way you could have been defamed.
What was the need for you to go to her house? and then what people would have thought about you & Anna? what anyone thinks or not, I don't know that mom but stop thinking wrong by following other people's words And look, Auntie Gulzaran, I beg you: stop causing fights in other people's homes Aunty, even if this proposal doesn't get finalized because of you, I will still come to your house to settle the fee for this proposal and for God sake, don't come to our house Very well said, dear! Anna hasn't come to your house after the wedding, and yet you are insulting your aunt Remember that time when I raised you and you grew up and today you are saying such things in front of me? ok Kausar, enough is enough. I am leaving now. Don't ever call me again. Ok? Gulzaran!
Gulzaran, at least listen to me there is no more Gulzaran Tell me, why you had gone to brother Khuda Baksh's house? Mom, you know very well that there are no other men in that house besides Uncle Khuda Buksh besides, he is an old & ill person he might need my help somehow, so I had gone to ask that don't explain me such things, I know all and you had gone to ask this from Anna? mom, I had gone to ask uncle but he wasn't at home Murad, you knew it that uncle Khuda Buksh had gone out of the house for some work you had gone there deliberately its not like that mom, you are thinking wrong for example if I had gone there, then what's the harm in it? remove such old school thoughts from your mind shall I tell you something, mom? Relationships are not made of wealth and money; they are made with love look, sit here be happy in your son's happiness I am doing this wedding for the sake of your happiness, else you know that I... Mom, don't worry about the tractor.
