[1390.80] go to the Dargah, and Abba Wali was troubling you a lot, so
[1393.84] because of her stubbornness, we were
[1396.20] forced, Abba
[1402.28] Baji is roaming around like a Chaudharani, servants and servants,
[1406.72] well yes Abba, she made
[1412.56] us sit on a sofa with soft cushions, she
[1415.20] gave us a lot to eat and drink,
[1417.76] she was saying that you people should
[1421.40] not go without eating food, so we said,
[1424.12] no Abba, we are working, we have to give food to Abba also,
[1429.52] Abba Baji was very worried for you, she was
[1434.56] telling us that  Both of you should take special care of Abba,
[1440.04] if you don't do this then she will come and take revenge for
[1442.64] both of us. Thank you my God,
[1447.52] I was very much worried
[1450.52] that there is bloodshed, a lot of cruelty is done to the girl,
