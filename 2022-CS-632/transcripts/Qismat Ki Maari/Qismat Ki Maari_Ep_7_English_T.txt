[4.92] I want to say that your Choti Pahne
[11.96] Shado, I was thinking that why not
[15.84] bring the second Anna also in this car,
[21.20] then take maximum revenge from them,
[24.44] how is it
[27.60] Veera, I will have to give thanks to your people
[33.81] [Music]
[40.00] Oh son, ever since that accident has happened, there are
[45.00] troubles everywhere, it
[49.24] seems
[51.80] as if troubles have taken over our house, are you
[55.76] trying to get me married or
[57.20] auction me, do you think I will be
[60.20] happy this way,
[63.00] because of the demand of your tractor, the lives of two families have been ruined,
[65.60] because of this trouble, uncle Khuda
[68.52] Bakhsh, got murdered,
[70.24] your mad brother has come here again, today
[74.40] I will not leave him, you already know
[76.80] that he has so many blisters on his hands,
[79.60] then why did you let him do this work,
[83.00] that Choti Chaudhari sahab, Guddu sahab, that
[87.12] Chirani sahab had said that get your
[90.92] Shado married to me,
[100.68] right? The thing is that I wanted
[108.36] that the oppression that is happening to you should end,
[113.24] this
[116.40] relationship of hatred should turn into love and affection and a new
[120.12] relationship should be formed, I am
[123.92] present in this connection  What
[129.32] I want to say is that I want to marry your younger
[134.36] sister
[139.04] Shado
[143.12] What are you saying, wait wait
[147.91] [Music]
[153.04] What are you saying, this is not right, this cannot happen, everything will be
[157.48] fine, it is
[162.56] not possible, now you will say
[167.04] that we are rich and you are
[172.88] poor, so let me tell you that
[177.16] I have spoken to your father in this regard,
[181.08] he asked for time to think,
[182.96] I said look into it,
[188.72] take care, and I tell you the same thing,
[193.72] think about this relationship
[196.08] and don't give such a decision
[200.12] that I have to say that this much
[203.36] oppression is not right
[206.79] [Music]
[224.55] [Music]
[227.52] O
[228.24] Allah help us, do
[231.20] n't put us in any such test now
[236.85] [Music] A
[258.72] relationship of Chaudhary Khushia for our Shado, this is what Chaudhary Khushia herself has told
[262.92] you, oh yes friend, I am telling you, he
[266.72] came himself after asking me,
[269.88] he seems appropriate to me, and as
[273.84] you are telling, he introduced you both to Anna,
[277.16] then he also came to drop Wali home
[279.84] and these days he also respects me a lot
[284.36] He is not bad, he just got
[288.00] divorced because of the murder of his brother, so
[291.84] what does he say, should I get into a
[294.24] relationship, look Khuda Baksh, you have done
[298.20] a great favour on me in my life, now I
[301.52] cannot give you any such advice that due to which
[303.40] you get stuck in some other issue,
[306.32] I cannot give you any advice in the matter of this Teej, brother,
[311.32] oh friend, that was a bad thing
[313.96] which can never be called back, it is
[317.52] possible that like every time, this time our decision may
[320.52] not be wrong, friend, are you right,
[323.68] God bless, by the way, Khushiya had also come to me
[328.04] with a complaint against Murad
[332.20] and he had also brought a witness of the theft, let me
[335.96] tell you one thing, Khuda Bakhsh, if now
[339.92] any incident happens at this camp, then this time
[343.44] I will not spare Murad, friend, if nothing
[346.52] happens, you do the same thing, by the way,
[350.84] Ali Sher, because of your courage,
[354.16] I have got great courage,
[359.96] oh
[362.32] God, it should not
[365.52] happen that I get married in the second year
[370.16] like this blood, like the pants of oppression get on,
[377.36] Shadu you have been since morning  You have been crying nothing will happen
[382.08] nothing will happen you have been saying since morning that
[385.92] nothing will happen Shamo why don't you understand
[390.60] we are the daughters of the murderer we will have to
[394.84] stand in the court of the murdered every time whether
[397.24] we will get punishment or we will be acquitted
[401.80] it will be their decision whether
[405.56] we will be happy
[408.72] with the punishment so don't be worried nothing will happen
[412.61] [Music]
[417.32] I will go and see what has happened Bha

[426.80] [Music] how are
[432.68] you Murad Bhai you have
[436.56] come at the right time what happened everything is fine you came
[439.36] inside

[454.32] swollen it seems you have cried a lot
[458.96] another doom is about to come in the house
[464.56] second
[467.48] doom
[469.68] yes second
[473.68] doom Khushi had come Abba my proposal was
[478.00] brought
[480.36] Abba asked for time from him what is it now
[485.12] Abba uncle
[488.44] consulted towards Sher Karan
[492.56] ok so that is why uncle was hiding the matter from me
[495.48] and how did these Chaudharis dare to
[498.84] ask for the proposal by the way uncle did not do well by
[501.32] hiding the matter from me and he knows very well
[503.92] what type of people they are Murad Bhai should do something
[508.44] no Abba them yes  Don't do it,
[515.56] by the way I have a solution for this problem,
[520.52] if Shad doesn't mind,
[524.92] I will send Amma for the proposal,
[534.76] what's the objection in this, Murad
[539.08] Bhai, now quickly bring Khala Jaan for the
[541.64] proposal, and if you
[546.00] send the proposal, Abba will not be
[549.96] able to refuse, he will decide in my favor,
[554.44] see
[556.40] Yaado, I am asking you once again, are
[560.48] you doing this proposal out of some compulsion, no
[566.56] sir, there is nothing like that, it's just
[572.84] my luck
[575.52] that I have to spend my whole life with a person like you, that's it,
[580.92] I'll bring Amma today itself to
[584.92] finalize the proposal
[587.63] [Music]
[607.01] [Music]
[610.96] Rajo Rajo ji ji Chani
[617.16] Saba yes what are your orders, there is only one order from Chaudharani that
[625.28] give as much trouble as possible to the daughter of the enemy
[628.61] [Music]
[631.16] what is she doing, she is teaching Chote Chaudharani sahab
[633.20] and when she was
[636.32] cutting fodder with the fodder cutting machine, her hands
[638.88] got blisters
[640.92] and later when I saw, blood started oozing out of her hands,
[646.36] as if you were telling me  You are
[649.88] telling me about his troubles, I am getting a lot of
[651.96] praise
[653.99] [music]
[656.16] Now how is his wound? Chauri sahab has
[660.20] applied ointment and bandaged it too. Wow brother, wow,
[664.48] mother should take care and son should
[669.16] apply ointment. Well, in a way, it is good too. This wound is
[673.40] also very important. Only when the old wound heals, we
[677.36] can give it again.
[681.76] Where has this happiness gone? I had gone to leave that mad person
[687.36] somewhere, but the poor Muslim was left behind there.
[692.68] Not in the homes of small people. Chaudhari sahab has come home
[695.84] now, he is sitting in the tent. Well,
[699.56] when he is done with his guests, then
[701.80] send him to me. I have to talk to him.
[704.20] Now you go and listen to him. Increase
[709.00] Anna's troubles as much as possible,
[711.40] so that your loneliness can also increase.
[720.80] Thank you, Charani
[732.48] ji. I don't know Murad putra, when will you be
[736.36] lucky to wear this wedding dress.
[744.72] Amma is looking at my wedding dress, will she do it without asking me or me?
[750.76] I am not so lucky that I can marry you according to my
[754.00] wish.
[755.28] Murad putra, if you agree, then I will marry you off in
[759.28] a  I will get it done in a day,
[761.56] well she will get me married in a day
[766.20] with the same girl who is coming to the jail with two tractors, the girl
[768.60] whom aunt Gulzar had shown the proposal, make
[770.76] fun of me, make fun of me I have only one
[774.52] wish, that before I die, I
[776.84] see a wedding garland on your head, then it will be fine, your
[780.12] wish has been fulfilled, have you seen any girl, I am
[783.76] telling the truth,
[787.48] you just have to go now to see the proposal,
[791.64] where, where you had gone before,
[795.44] where did you go to
[799.76] uncle Khuda Baksh's house, Murad son, are you not
[805.16] crazy, you can see only that house in the whole village, there are other
[808.24] houses also,
[811.40] only Khuda Baksh's house has daughters and no
[814.76] one else has daughters, Mamma, they are the
[817.80] best people in this whole village, yes, yes I
[820.52] know they are very good people, the father commits murder
[824.20] and the daughters serve the sentence, my
[827.72] son has suffered the punishment with them without any reason, there is no
[830.48] need to get a proposal in their house,
[833.56] earlier you used to like Anna, now Shado, there is no other
[837.16] girl, do you stay at one place or
[839.84] not, see Amma, first Unna's helplessness came in the way
[843.04] Chaudhary is
[845.92] taking undue advantage of this and is in the affair of another
[847.92] [sangeet]
[849.40] I will not allow this oppression to happen to another
[852.92] [sangeet]
[857.88] I will not let any injustice happen to any other girl, shame on you,
[860.56] you have been very
[863.44] helpful, Amma, once on my request,
[867.48] go and talk to uncle Khuda Bakh, I am
[870.16] sure in the house of Allah, he will not refuse,
[872.88] Amma, and do not do anything wrong in the future,
[875.48] okay, as you say,
[881.56] my dear Amma, my
[886.96] princess, you have not even kept this properly,
[889.68] bring it, I will
[892.36] give that to him too
[895.09] [sangeet] I am
[939.04] very sorry, your hand is injured,
[941.40] otherwise today I would have
[947.36] pressed my feet on you, you would have remembered your status,
[952.56] now heal them quickly and tell me
[956.96] what lesson are you teaching my son,
[960.76] that Chandni ji, that is the
[963.12] lesson of his books, now take a lesson
[967.24] from me also, if you teach
[970.40] any lesson to my son against me or my family members, then
[972.44] I will affect you in such a way that
[975.40] you will not be scared of Chaudharys, who have seven generations
[977.64] [Music]
[985.40] Now why are you standing and looking at my face, get out of
[988.64] my sight
[1005.92] [Music]
[1014.04] And no Baji, don't talk to your sister with such respect
[1020.64] Now this much cruelty is
[1028.20] not right now Bakhtawar go,
[1037.40] what has happened to you these days you are showing
[1040.24] so much mercy on the enemies
[1042.32] You even saved that mad man from my hands
[1045.56] I came to know that you had taken Anna to meet his father
[1049.28] and sister
[1051.24] And today you even went to drop that mad man to his home
[1056.00] And now I will have to say that this much
[1059.36] cruelty is not good
[1060.97] [Laughter]
[1064.25] [Music]
[1066.04] No now Baji ji
[1068.88] jaan your father never made a cheap deal
[1072.84] [Music]
[1074.56] I thought that my wife has a
[1079.76] big hatred for the killer's car owners For revenge there is only
[1084.80] one
[1087.00] Anna I was thinking why not
[1090.92] bring the second Anna also in this car
[1096.24] Then take maximum revenge from them
[1099.48] How is it
[1101.88] Bha Veera you will have to give a slap to the people
[1106.60] Well you are creating an atmosphere but
[1111.12] your wife will not let this happen
[1119.08] My old lady of the Chaudhary race will be here so she will not
[1123.28] let it happen, right  She is
[1129.04] not here at all You made the first move
[1132.60] and I remained a spectator What a move you made
[1137.40] Wow
[1139.84] But I will make the next move Keep doing as I
[1142.72] say
[1146.44] and remain a spectator And if
[1151.88] this second move of ours succeeds then
[1156.64] see the whole community will be forced to say
[1160.72] Kaka now this much oppression is not right
[1177.76] O Wali son you have become very naughty Well

[1280.04] What are you saying Kausar pan Shadu's
[1284.04] marriage
[1285.80] with Murad what will people say that earlier the elder daughter's
[1289.56] marriage was being arranged and now the younger daughter's marriage is being arranged though
[1292.24] I do
[1296.56] n't care about what people say
[1299.40] but I am also not able to understand this thing
[1303.04] Khuda bakh para what is there to not understand in this
[1305.56] people make relations
[1308.56] with their sisters-in-law even after their wives die May
[1311.60] Allah give life to Khadana khwasta Anna she is
[1314.60] not dead her marriage has happened out of helplessness

[1332.22] [Music]
[1334.64] you brother sahab what is there to think in this if one
[1338.08] thinks then one goes where there is a stranger
[1341.40] and Kausar pan
[1343.12] you have put me in a strange test of
[1349.96] thinking  We need time Bhaisahab Murad is
[1353.68] your child and you are still
[1356.20] asking for time to think about it
[1357.17] [Music]

[1393.64] [Music]
[1397.44] Sajan My Lulu's
[1402.04] love
[1405.60] Sajan Shad Ab was not aware of this and
[1410.80] he was not mentally prepared either,
[1413.28] that is why he has asked for time for this relationship
[1416.76] Aunt Kosar did not refuse
[1420.12] No
[1422.76] Shamu Abba's tone was of refusal only
[1427.72] You may agree or not
[1430.56] Shamo I am telling you again Abba's
[1434.40] intentions are towards happiness only Shammu
[1439.40] Anna Baji has sacrificed a lot for us
[1445.40] and if I get married there
[1449.76] Shamu Anna Baji's sacrifice will go in vain
[1454.88] Shado you are right I will also go and talk to Abba
[1461.19] [Music]
[1475.36] What mother Uncle has asked for time
[1479.44] You will be happy, your heart will be
[1482.92] satisfied
[1484.12] Amma go for my sake You have gone for your
[1487.04] sake I got the reward
[1490.72] Amma I doubt this uncle has done this out of
[1493.92] fear of the Chaudhrys  You must have done it because of something, you must have been
[1496.84] compelled to do it
[1500.40] Murad putra, I think, but God, the
[1504.40] car owners have cast a spell on you,
[1506.76] you speak in their favour every time
[1509.48] and they treat you the same way every time, enough is enough
[1512.28] now, either you
[1515.88] give me a car or let me see it, Amma, you are
[1518.76] not understanding what I am saying, well then today either you make me
[1521.60] understand or you
[1524.16] understand what I am saying,
[1526.12] Abba, what have you done
[1528.54] [sangeet],
[1530.00] for Murad bhai's marriage, you
[1532.72] asked for time to think,
[1534.08] that Murad bhai to whom you were
[1538.56] ready to give your dearest daughter, you were
[1542.20] ready to give half the price of the tractor
[1545.32] and you asked for time for his marriage,
[1548.80] oh son, I considered Murad as my eldest
[1552.60] son-in-law,
[1555.76] now how can you give him the marriage of the younger daughter, well, if you
[1560.16] ask the truth, I have no
[1566.00] complaint against Murad, it was his mother who took
[1571.80] advantage of our helplessness and
[1575.36] demanded half the amount of the tractor,
[1577.68] now if
[1581.32] she demands something again for the marriage of the younger daughter, then what will I
[1585.52] do son, I will have to
[1588.40] face a new test  I will not be
[1592.40] able to do it and if they do
[1594.76] not demand the tractor,
[1596.44] then we will decide according to that time.
[1603.04] Abba, because of your decision at this time,
[1606.44] Shado is crying and in a very bad state. And why is she crying?
[1610.28] Shado, her father is still alive. Call
[1614.44] him. O Shado, Shado son, come
[1619.20] here, my son, come here to me.
[1625.12] Son, what happened? Why are you crying?
[1628.96] You no longer trust your father.
[1632.20] Son, parents do not take any wrong decision for their children. I am
[1637.84] already very upset because of Anna.
[1642.44] Now I do not want to take any wrong decision in a hurry again.
[1650.28] That is why I have asked for time from the Chaudharis
[1653.56] and also from Murad's mother.
[1656.31] [Sangeet]
[1670.24] Chaudhry sahab, you have promised
[1674.48] me twice. You have neither given me animals nor are you
[1677.84] giving me my money. You are not fulfilling your promise.
[1681.50] [Sangeet] Oh,
[1686.88] look
[1690.00] brother, you had made this
[1692.68] deal with my brother-in-law, late Chaudhry Hashmat
[1697.20] and I was not present at that time, but
[1702.40] still I had agreed to give you animals.
[1708.92] And if I
[1710.72] refuse, then you cannot touch even a hair of mine,
[1718.96] nor will you have any excuse for this.  There is proof,
[1722.20] right? You can prove it. In
[1726.32] this way, a case of 400B will be filed against you. If a
[1734.00] case of 400 is filed,
[1739.08] you cannot do that.
[1741.60] Then let's do this. We will take
[1747.80] you to the same person with whom you had made the deal. We will
[1751.72] settle the matter face to face.
[1760.20] Chaudhary
[1762.40] sahab, you are not doing well. You are being too harsh. I will
[1765.52] kill you all.
[1775.24] Now, so much cruelty is not right for such a small thing.
[1780.45] [Music]
[1781.84] No, look
[1784.16] brother, you have come to my camp,
[1787.36] that's why I am leaving you. And
[1791.08] till now, you are not going up and complaining about me to Chaudhary Hashmat.
[1801.76] Now, you can go.
[1806.88] Yes, there is no need to come again. But if the
[1811.56] arrangement for the animals has been made, I will get the cattle fed myself.
[1816.60] Otherwise, your Naseeb sahab, you are being
[1821.00] too harsh on me.
[1824.16] Let's get up.
[1829.29] [Music]
[1845.64] Guddu son, and how is your maid teaching
[1849.88] you? And I mean that Anna,
[1853.56] your Ustani ji, Anna ji is teaching very well
[1856.24] and she is very nice. But
[1860.20] Amma, why do you speak so badly with her? The
[1863.00] mistake is of her father.  But
[1868.36] why should Anna ji be punished
