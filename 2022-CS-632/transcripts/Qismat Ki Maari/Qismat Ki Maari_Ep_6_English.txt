Anna, Anna was saying, he hasn't even eaten food. May Allah bless him and why is Abba's face hanging low. I was getting married thinking that my daughter's life should not pass, but this marriage has ruined my Anna's life. This is not a marriage.  This is oppression Abba, should I not bring food son, I am not hungry Abba, after the morning prayers, you went straight to pick up Murad Bhai After that, you and Shado are coming back now and you are not feeling hungry Oh son, hunger is not related to delay, it is related to the peace inside Abba, is everything alright, you look quite worried Oh son, ever since that accident happened, there are problems everywhere It seems as if problems have taken over our house Abba, what has happened, nothing, son, I want to be alone for some time Leave me alone [Music] Abba, it's fine [Music] Anna went to Baji's house [Music] Chatrani again told me that Chand Rani was not there Khash had arranged a meeting with Baji, so this is a matter of happiness What is there to worry about in this, the worrying thing is this [Music] Yaado, the man Baji is married to, he is a 12- year-old boy, Nawaz's life has been ruined The Chaudharis took such a big revenge in the bloodshed Apa even killed one of their family  I knew he was giving me a hard time [Music] Oh God, when will this series of rituals end? Then only will we have to go through this series of trials [Laughter] [Music] Today you can make the fake lions and doors as strong as you want. It is very important for the people inside to be strong. Murad is the one who has tried to harm you. He is the same person inside. Who told you about it? We also live in this village and we are keeping an eye on the news. We have our doubts but I don't believe it is a theft. This man Murad promised me that he will bring the animal in two days and it is another matter that maybe he did n't take the chance. By the way uncle, you shouldn't have left Murad and if such an incident happens tomorrow, then you can't even make a claim. It was my duty to tell you. The rest is up to you. If you don't believe it, then ask this man what wrong has Murad said. Ask him why is he looking at me [Music] [Music] Why not, this is enough for today. Come and have your food.

Amma, leave this matter of marriage and this aunt Gulzar, refuse clearly. From today onwards, no relationship should come to this house. Murad son, remember one thing of mine, whether you are ready or unhappy, I have to get you married. See, I will get you married, but not in this way, the way you want, okay, do it as you say, my son, eat your food, if you don't eat, I will also not eat. You go, okay, both the mother and the son will eat together. [Music] O, I am not eating properly these days sir, I have a dog's hand, the one who is not well-behaved, let it go brother, after all, he also has some right, now this much cruelty is not right. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] You are alone and father, now your mad son has come here again, today I will not leave him. Now this much cruelty is not right. Be careful, wear it.  Allah, people are happy, don't give him any medicine, he will have to be taught a lesson, otherwise he will come here again and again with his head held high, and leave him, he doesn't know, now I will make him understand that he will not come here anymore, come here, come on, press the sieve inside [Music] Abba ji, yes son, Wali has not come since morning, I and Shamo should go and find out, he must be sitting at the court, oh no son, you wait, I will go and find out myself, Abba come, come out, well done, come, has the cart come, come, check it, see, come, come, shsh oh Abba, see that, Abba come on, Shi Sahab, you Shamma son, go and quickly bring a chair for Chaudhary Sahab and this water also [Music] Bring tea for Shad, son of Chaudhary Sahab, bring it quickly, Abba sit, Chacha Jaan had come to meet me, I introduced you to the mansion, Anna, I introduced you to the Gawachi on the way, so I came to drop you, it's a great kindness of yours, Chaudhary Sahab and Chacha, why do n't you embarrass me by saying this, I had hinted towards this earlier also, but you  Didn't you understand, we have become related to each other and in relationships, it is not acceptable to express gratitude. I want to end this enmity and hatred and form a new relationship. [ Music] Let's get your Shaad married to me. [Music] [Music] S.S. Chaudhary sahab, it was by chance that the relationship was formed due to bloodshed. You are big people and we are small, well, I want to end this nonsense and enmity. You see, if I get related to Shaad, then both of us will become each other's support. The hatred will turn into love. Look son, I cannot take such a big decision so quickly. I need some time to think. Yes, no problem. You can take as much time as you want and I don't mind, I will come later. I'm leaving. Cha sahab, you go and have tea, she would be bringing it. Uncle, now I will eat some sweets. I wo n't be able to take that long. [Music] Take this son, hold him, Chaudhary sahab, don't give him money. He does n't know anything about money, and neither will we give him money. Oh uncle, it's okay, he's a cute little child. I 'm leaving. [Music] Shamma Abba, I don't know what has happened, earlier also Anna Baji's relationship happened in an accident and out of compulsion, and Abba has seen the outcome as well, still I don't know why Abba, then Shadu, you should not be worried, nothing like this will happen, Abba must have said this just to avoid him, now he cannot reply openly, after all Anna Baji is at his home, I will talk to Abba and make him understand, Sham and those people are not good, I know those people are not good, you do n't worry [Music] [Prashan] What are you doing, earlier you had so many blisters on your hands, Rajo Khala, you already know that he has so many blisters on his hands, then why did you let him do this work, Chhote Chaudhary sahab, Gudu sahab, Chani Saba said, today I will have to talk to Amma, Chhote Chha Sahab, my name is Imtiaz, and I am lovingly called Guddu, you also call me Guddu, Chhote Chaudhary, don't say, tell me one thing, why do you stop me from talking to Amma, come with me [Music] Salaam  Uncle Khuda bakh where are you going O son Murad I have only one best friend Ali Sher I was just going to meet him I had to talk to him about something important what is so important uncle nothing son I am just going to meet him ok I saw uncle Vash coming out of your house [music] why did he come ok he had gone to meet Wali so I brought him along so that he does n't get lost on the way by the way Khushiya is a good boy among the Chaudharys uncle Khushiya and ok good son I am leaving now we will meet after namaz yes ok uncle Allah [music] office Chaudhary Khushiya must play some trick and uncle Khuda is also hiding his side from me what can be the matter [music] [music] wow wow [music] wow our nephew is being taught Manna ji what has happened to you he is hurt uncle mother hit him with a stick as punishment due to which his hands got injured and blood also came out then I applied ointment on his hands so you did a great injustice  Sister has not treated a delicate girl like you with such cruelty I will talk to sister I remembered and I had to tell you something very important I will do it if you have my permission [Music] Guddu son please go out I want to talk to your wife sorry sorry I mean I want to talk to your Ustani ji go uncle you can talk to her in front of me Guddu let's go okay uncle I will go out my books are also here I will come back after some time yes go well done na ji the thing is I wanted that the cruelty that is being done to you should end this relationship of hatred should turn into love and a new relationship should be formed in this connection I came across that I want to say that not your Choti Pend but Shado I want to marry her [Music]
