All the preparations are complete, it's just that at the appointed time, the dead body of the murderer's daughter has to be brought instead of her doli (palanquin) [Music] Anna ji, I will arrange for the money, and I will bring the money and give it to you. Then you give it to my mother, father will not agree [Music] And I will also not agree. What have you done? Before the police arrives, take it upon yourself. I will fulfill the promise I made to you. The police have taken your father away. Why did the police do that? Now Khuda Bakh has murdered Chaudhry Amat, so it is the decision of the congregation. Khuda Bakh will give the marriage of one of his three daughters to the deceased's heir and after two days, the wedding procession will go to Khuda Bakhsh's house [Music] My Lu Lu de wich love dear My Lulu de wich love dear There is no attachment, no illusion I have been driven by love There is a slowdown in the weather of the heart, yet I am your captive My Lulu de wich love dear My Lulu  De wich pyar [Music] Sajan Chaudhary sahab, you have left this world, but on whose support have you left us? Panchayat is fine, whatever decision you take, what is the benefit to us? You will not return to this world, you will definitely benefit. The enemy has got such a punishment which is worse than death. His friend, his father is alive, but he will die every moment. His whole family will be destroyed. He is not my saviour, he will not return. I have captured his heart in my fist. Whenever the heart desires, we will take revenge for our Chaudhary from him. He will give us his daughter's marriage in exchange for blood. I will get that woman when I will be alive. We will keep on troubling her. No happiness. You have your own wife and your own responsibility. I want that the life of comfort that I am living, the way I have lived the life of a widow, she should also live such a life without marriage. This will be a rebellion against the decision of the Panchayat. Her marriage will also happen according to the decision of the Panchayat, and she will also live the life of a widow. Did n't you understand? You will understand everything when the time comes. Just tell me how many days are left to take the wedding procession. Yes, two days [Music] Days ji  Take your two days' life [Music] Wake up, God bless you, give me permission, I will go home friend Ali Sher you will not drop me home No, God bakh, I cannot face your tears, friend So from where will I get the courage to face my daughters Ask God, after all, you have to go somewhere, right? And God, Sona, may you help you in this test, God [Music] I will keep uncle, God bakh, even I will not be able to face it, Khuda Hafiz [Music] Murad, did you go to pick up Abba, right? I am leaving Uncle at home, thank you, my Abba, the decision was taken in the Panchayat, we are coming after hearing it, what decision did the Panchayat give, the Panchayat gave the decision, ask that from Uncle yourself [Music] I had said, now [Music] Where is Anna, she has gone to Shavali Sai's court to pray for your life, that you may not be laughed at because of that [Music] [Music] Apa Abba Muna Abba [Music] Look Abba Allah, thank you a million times  You returned safely, son. I had died the moment I heard the Panchayat's decision. There is only a living corpse standing in front of you [Music] Nothing is more important than your life, don't you, Abba? I prayed for you at Shah Shah's court. I told Allah not to do anything to my father. May my father's life be saved. I wish I had prayed for my death instead of my life. Then today I wouldn't have to listen to the Panchayat's decision. Abba, you are not straying from your life. Panchayat's decision. I also got my wish. On the way, I asked what is the Panchayat's decision, but he didn't tell me anything. By the way, what is the Panchayat's decision? Panchayat 's decision [Music] The Panchayat has decided that the murderer will give the hand of one of his daughters to the deceased's husband [Music] Now tell me around which of my daughters' neck should I put the noose of the punishment for my crimes. Around whose neck should I put it? Daughter is a blessing from the God, it is a moving mercy. Play the drum to the beat of the heart and believe in its value. Play the drum to the beat of the heart and value the desires.
