[5.16] All the preparations are complete, it's just that at the appointed
[9.04] time, the dead body of the murderer's daughter has to be brought instead of her doli (palanquin)
[19.83] [Music]
[44.56] Anna ji, I will arrange for the money,
[47.20] and I will bring the money and give it to you. Then you
[49.88] give it to my mother, father will
[53.08] not agree
[54.33] [Music]
[57.12] And I will also not agree. What have you
[65.60] done? Before the police
[68.08] arrives, take it upon yourself. I will
[71.28] fulfill the promise I made to you. The
[73.76] police have taken your father away.
[78.04] Why did the police do that? Now Khuda Bakh has murdered
[81.36] Chaudhry Amat,
[84.60] so it is the decision of the congregation. Khuda Bakh will give the
[89.08] marriage of one of his three daughters to the
[92.40] deceased's heir
[94.28] and after two days, the wedding procession will go to Khuda Bakhsh's house

[193.32] Sajan Chaudhary sahab, you have left this world,
[197.40] but on whose support have you left us?
[201.12] Panchayat is fine, whatever decision you take,
[203.72] what is the benefit to us?
[205.12] You will not return to this world, you will
[226.00] definitely benefit. The
[229.28] enemy has got such a punishment
[233.96] which is worse than death. His
[237.92] friend, his father is alive, but he will
[243.72] die every moment. His whole family will be destroyed. He is not
[248.48] my saviour, he will not
[250.96] return. I have captured his heart in my fist.
[256.48] Whenever the heart
[259.32] desires, we will take revenge for our Chaudhary from him. He will give
[263.76] us his daughter's marriage in exchange for blood.
[273.68] I will get that woman when I will be alive. We will keep on
[277.12] troubling her.
[282.96] No
[285.48] happiness. You have your own wife and your own responsibility. I
[289.52] want that the life of comfort that I am living, the
[292.80] way I have
[295.28] lived the life of a widow, she should also live such a life
[297.48] without marriage.
[301.04] This will be a rebellion against the decision of the Panchayat.
[304.20] Her marriage will also happen according to the decision of the Panchayat,
[307.52] and she will also live the life of a widow. Did
[313.72] n't you understand? You will understand everything when the time comes. Just
[318.56] tell me how many
[320.80] days are left to take the wedding procession. Yes, two days
[324.38] [Music]
[327.16] Days ji  Take your two days'

[581.56] prayed for my death instead of my life. Then
[585.52] today I wouldn't have to listen to the Panchayat's decision.
[593.24] Abba, you are not straying from your life.
[596.00] Panchayat's
[597.96] decision. I also got my wish. On the way,
[602.08] I asked what is the Panchayat's
[604.52] decision, but he didn't
[608.56] tell me anything. By the way, what is the Panchayat's
[616.68] decision? Panchayat
[620.12] 's decision
[627.25] [Music] The
[636.52] Panchayat has decided
[639.12] that the murderer will
[644.76] give the hand of one of his daughters to the deceased's husband
[656.25] [Music]
[659.40] Now tell me around
[664.92] which of my daughters' neck should I put the noose of the punishment for my crimes. Around
[669.24] whose neck should I put it?
[673.20] Daughter is a blessing from the God, it is a moving mercy.
