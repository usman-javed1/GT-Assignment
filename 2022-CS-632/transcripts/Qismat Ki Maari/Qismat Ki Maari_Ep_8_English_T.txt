[5.04] Congratulations Shado, from today you too have become a Chaudharani.
[9.28] Eat or not
[13.12] Chau sahab, for God's sake, don't do this injustice,
[18.52] I will do as you say.
[21.92] Chaudhari is giving the news of his marriage, that of his
[25.32] funeral
[28.52] [music]
[30.48] For me there is news of marriage, for you there will be a
[33.60] funeral
[36.21] [music]
[44.00] I want to say that I don't want your younger
[49.08] sister
[53.84] Shado, I want to marry her,
[57.32] God, it should
[61.44] not
[63.56] happen that the second sister also gets covered up like the first one, like Anna, the
[68.24] pants of this cruelty get pulled up, are you
[73.84] crazy? You can see only that house in the whole body, there
[80.12] are other houses also, only Khuda Baksh has a daughter and no
[83.44] one else has daughters. I was thinking,
[85.96] why not bring the second Anna also in this car,
[93.48] then take maximum revenge from him For
[96.72] Murad Bhai's relation, you
[99.92] asked for time to think, that
[102.08] Murad Bhai, to whom you were
[106.32] ready to give your most beloved daughter Guddu, let me
[111.16] agree to your words
[113.29] [music]
[114.60] From today, hatred for Anna is over and love is over.
[123.28] Anna,
[133.60] Anna ji, Chani Saba, come and sit
[143.32] near me  Why are you sitting down? Come here and
[146.60] sit near me and
[157.28] listen to me. What was to happen has happened.
[162.16] Now what is the use of hating you for me?
[165.20] Chaudhary sahab should not come and you are the
[169.16] head of this house,
[172.08] you are the head of this house, after today you will not do
[176.32] any work, okay?
[180.04] [Music]
[183.44] Salam Charani
[186.80] ji, you had called me, give me orders,
[191.48] you say Bismillah
[197.55] [Music]
[200.68] Go Guddu son, you also
[206.32] go inside and sit down. Hala Gulzar
[214.36] ji Chaudharani ji what are your orders, what is the matter of orders,
[217.84] tell me this, these small
[220.64] marriages that you keep arranging, do you get any benefit from them
[222.72] or not, Charani ji, we manage to
[225.24] survive but until the relationship is
[228.64] confirmed, no one
[231.04] gives money, by Bismillah, when it gets confirmed somewhere,
[233.52] then we get a little bit
[241.44] [Music] Has
[246.16] Kausar Pahan asked for a marriage relation for her wish?
[249.72] O, for Anna's relationship
[252.80] also, she had demanded the money for a tractor
[255.04] and I feel that this
[258.60] demand has come again in her mind
[261.12] and see God  Baksh, ever since there has been a theft in my farm,
[264.40] Murad has gone out of my heart.
[267.12] Ali Sher brother,
[270.52] Murad is neither a thief nor a bad boy,
[274.84] but my heart is not accepting him for marriage.
[278.24] If your heart is not accepting it, then
[280.96] what is the compulsion in this, that the relationship should be done
[283.40] there only. And see, everything is given by God. The
[286.72] mother is greedy and the son is
[291.00] stealing.
[292.68] And you are guarding the house. From where are you coming?
[297.48] I had gone to Chaudhary sahab's house. Saba is a very pious
[300.84] lady. She helps me throughout the year and
[304.60] helps many widows like me
[307.20] secretly. Today, in front of my eyes, Chandrani
[310.64] Sahiba apologized to Anna.
[316.72] Ok brother, now I am leaving. May
[319.64] Allah keep the Chaudharys happy.
[326.24] Yes, Ali Sher brother, I told you
[329.88] that Khushiya introduced us to Anna and
[333.60] Vali also went to meet her and then he brought him home. Yes,
[337.96] Khushiya also came to me to
[342.24] tell about Murad and if there is a theft again,
[346.12] what will you do? And he had also brought proof with him
[349.56] and he also told about that person.  This is the person in
[354.88] front of whom Murad had talked about the animal,
[360.00] brother Murad, but I cannot doubt this matter,
[363.76] okay, then it is as you wish
[372.70] [Music]
[378.00] I am not surprised at their prayers
[382.64] because I know that these are deceitful people, may
[389.72] Allah keep my family away from their deceit, I have
[411.00] seen Anna ji, my mother has
[414.92] listened to me, now they should never
[418.20] do anything bad to you
[421.08] Chaudhary Guddu sahab, you are an innocent
[424.56] child, how would you know that not
[428.72] only I but you too have become the target of their cruelty
[433.07] [Music]
[434.92] Anna ji, are you happy, I will ask you for
[440.08] food
[446.28] [Music]
[449.05] [Laughter]
[456.04] Gulzar had come to Ali Sher's home,
[459.60] what is the work of aunt Gujra
[462.60] at Abba home, she was coming from Chaudhary sahab's house, she
[466.12] stopped near us on the way, she was
[468.60] telling that Chaudharani sahiba has
[473.20] apologized to Anna in front of me
[477.56] and she was also telling that Chaudharani sahiba has
[481.48] borne the expenses of many widows like me
[484.56] and Chaudhary Khushiya helps many orphanages and hospitals in the city,
[493.60] wow, what a thing it
[495.68] is  Some people appear one thing but are something else from inside,
[503.40] only Allah
[506.52] knows, father, how wrong we misunderstood them, may God forgive us
[514.10] [Music]
[527.52] Chaudharani Sahiba, you come to my house,
[533.80] what is the name of your son, he is very
[537.44] cool, a very cute child, his
[541.44] name is Wali, please forgive me, yesterday I behaved
[545.04] very rudely with Wali, if
[549.96] possible Bhai Sahiba, then you too can forgive me,
[553.88] Chaudharani Sahiba, the respect you have given me by coming to my house, I
[558.40] cannot repay it,
[562.80] and the way you are taking care of my Anna,
[566.20] what more do I
[570.60] need, but Bhai Sahib, I want your forgiveness,
[576.36] sister, why are you embarrassing me,
[579.32] who am I to forgive you,
[583.16] see Bhai Sahib, there has been a murder in our house,
[589.04] that is why you know, I get a little angry,
[592.12] but forgetting everything, I have come to
[595.88] your house to apologize to you,
[600.64] and if you do not listen to me, then I will
[604.92] understand that you have not forgiven me
[610.12] [Music]
[611.52] Actually, I came to your house in connection with the relationship that Khushiya had
[615.12] talked to you about  I have come
[618.32] today in front of my eyes Chandrani
[621.60] Sahiba apologized to Anna and
[624.56] told her Nakrani to serve Anna she
[628.08] is the daughter-in-law of this house
[630.77] [Music]
[640.60] Bhaisahab you did not reply to my request

[1030.52] Khushia Mamu has married three times
[1038.36] and where are those three, two have been married  Mamu had
[1041.92] divorced her and she is angry with another Mamu
[1046.92] Well, how did he
[1049.76] treat the ones whom he divorced, Mamu used to beat them
[1052.76] and
[1056.16] how did he treat the one who went away angry, Mamu doesn't
[1060.04] say anything to them, he is afraid of them because he is a
[1062.84] bigger Chaudhari
[1063.68] [sangeet] than me It is
[1069.12] very good that she has been
[1072.92] arranged, now you see
[1075.28] how I will
[1076.60] teach her a lesson It is a good thing,
[1084.76] Anna, you know where we went and for
[1088.64] what purpose we went, we have arranged for another maid in the house, the
[1102.12] maid too is the
[1104.68] daughter of the enemy and we will
[1109.36] keep her as a shoe for your feet,
[1113.92] Chau Sahib, for God's sake, don't do this cruelty, I will do
[1118.08] as you say,
[1122.00] I will serve you, don't develop a relationship with my sister, the
[1126.12] relationship has been confirmed, after three days,
[1129.92] Khuda Baksh's daughter will be at our mercy and kindness
[1135.00] Chauni Sahiba, for God's sake, don't do this,
[1139.76] I will serve you as you say, don't
[1142.68] bring my sister here, girl, the cruelty that your father did to
[1146.40] us, you
[1148.20] cannot see that, young me  I have made me a widow, my
[1151.00] son an orphan,
[1152.84] now you see what I do to him,
[1155.84] when God forbid, every moment will ache, that day
[1159.84] my heart will get cold, Baazi, give me leave,
[1163.24] give me leave, and now this much cruelty is not right
[1166.95] [Music]
[1169.76] Sonna, this is what we have to do, whatever
[1174.16] you can do, do it, otherwise you will get out
[1177.52] of here, go with Rajo and Bhakta and
[1180.96] clean the mansion
[1188.59] [Music]
[1195.08] Amma Jaan, Mamu Jaan, yes sir, why are you behaving like this
[1201.91] [Music] Hey
[1211.28] Abba,
[1215.88] Abba, Sado, Sado, cry, cry, oh son,
[1222.84] girls cry at the time of their departure,
[1225.56] what is the problem in this, hey
[1229.04] Sadhu, cry, cry, ok, let's go friends
[1232.91] [Music]
[1237.48] Come on, you both are crying as if there has been a dead body in this house, God forbid,
[1244.12] Abba, is this news any less than a dead body,
[1248.04] you were in such a hurry to give the verdict,
[1251.08] Abba, even before giving the verdict of death sentence,
[1255.68] time is given, what do you two sisters
[1259.00] think that in the houses of Chaudharis, relations are made
[1261.84] as a punishment and  No my
[1265.24] son it is not like that, it was
[1267.12] just an accident with Anna, to
[1272.24] erase that accident I am doing this
[1275.40] relation
[1277.72] so that hatred also ends and Anna's
[1282.04] punishment also ends, Abba, what is the need for him to take
[1286.08] revenge and bring us
[1290.32] and Abba, what is the guarantee that what
[1294.36] you are thinking is true, the
[1298.00] biggest proof of this is that Chaudharani Sahiba
[1301.24] herself came to our house when her husband was murdered,
[1304.88] still she forgot everything and came herself, apologized,
[1308.68] asked for the relation and what do we
[1313.12] need, that son Sona, God knows, I am doing this
[1317.76] relation only for Anna's sake
[1320.80] so that he gets happiness and his punishment gets
[1325.96] reduced, still if you think
[1329.48] that I am guilty and Anna keeps getting this punishment, then
[1334.80] fine, I will go and make the Chaudharis
[1338.80] refuse it, wait
[1342.84] Abba, if it is about Anna baaji, then not only the relation,
[1347.76] I also accept it, you say yes to her [
[1352.03] music]
[1376.04] brother
[1392.46] [music]
[1406.08] and Jamra sahab
[1408.73] [laughter] I have
[1411.36] come to give you a very good news, those relations that were supposed to
[1416.24] happen to you, could
[1419.32] not happen to you
[1422.32] Now he has become mine,
[1426.12] he must not have informed you about this,
[1429.56] I thought I should inform him now so much
[1432.44] oppression is
[1433.80] not right next Friday Chaudhary, Khursheed and Khushiya's wedding
[1438.48] procession will go with great pomp, please
[1445.60] participate and gain rewards
[1451.96] Chaudhary is telling the news of his marriage, that of
[1454.44] his funeral
[1456.57] [laughter] For
[1459.44] me there is news of the marriage, for you it must be of the funeral, that is
[1464.88] why I am telling it in the manner of the funeral, the
[1471.12] wish went unfulfilled this time also the wish was not fulfilled
[1475.48] now so much oppression is not right, God
[1482.04] uncle
[1483.72] Chaudhary, in the intoxication of wealth and power, you have forgotten one thing, the
[1486.72] God who has taken your life, has taken your life
[1490.52] and the day he puts the sword on you, then you will
[1494.40] not be able to utter these words, neither will the oppression be right, it is right, it is right, the slow
[1499.44] pace will
[1505.88] see the betrayal
[1508.49] [Music]
[1520.26] [Music] There is no stone left unturned,

[1538.56] do except blowing on the mouse, the
