[96.00] Are both of your guys awake?
[100.16] sister
[102.00] today onwards, we will do all our father's work
[106.99] why so?
[108.72] right sister? We have decided to take care of Dad's responsibilities ourselves before your wedding
[119.71] greetings dad!
[121.82] greetings dear!
[124.18] dad, did you see both of them? They have started to talk very wisely
[129.12] Sister, since we have to handle everything after your marriage, why not start now?
[136.15] Anna, both of them are right
[139.30] as it is, you are the guest in this house for a few days
[143.29] let them do it
[144.77] dad, you are also siding them
[148.65] ok fine, until I am here
[152.52] until then let me fulfill the right of my responsibilities
[156.29] ok dear, as you wish
[161.33] I am leaving
[165.80] dad
[166.88] yes dear?
[169.01] oh!
[174.19] dear, I keep this stick habitually
[178.15] but... the support which doesn't let me fall
[183.73] are my daughters
[188.56] may God bless you with good fate
[193.27] but dad, people doesn't consider their daughters good
[196.50] oh no dear, its not like that
[200.13] its just...
[202.92] they are afraid of their daughter's fate
[211.55] yes
[213.19] I am getting late for the prayers, I ma leaving. Ok?
[217.81] Alright
[222.75] you both! Do we say such things in front of dad?
[227.06] yes sister, we say such things
[229.05] have some shame
[239.66] everything is right uncle, but tell me how are you feeling now?
[243.18] I am fine, and today I am happy as well
[246.55] Shammo & Shado have started to realize their responsibilities
[250.60] its such a good thing, uncle
[260.53] Anna had never made them feel the absence of their mother, and she had never let me miss having a son
[266.53] now Anna will also leave then...
hey no uncle
[269.65] Anna is not going that far, she can come to meet you daily
[275.03] in fact, I will bring her myself to meet you all
[278.83] I am also your son, right?
[283.20] God forbid, if you ever experience a bad situation, I will be standing by your side
[287.80] stay blessed dear, may God bless you with a lot of happiness
[292.67] don't know what do I say while being emotional
[296.80] alright then uncle, I shall take your leave now as I have to distribute the wedding invites too
[300.93] ok dear, lets go
[310.64] oh God! you have served me such a bad drink
[314.20] by the way sister, heartiest congratulations to you!
[318.09] after all, you have fulfilled your son's contumacy
[322.42] by fixing Murad's marriage with Anna
[326.53] oh sister, what shall I tell you?
[328.77] By the way, I felt so disappointed. It wouldn't have been any harm if you would have told me about it
[337.22] Gulzaran, what shall I tell you?
[339.82] anyways, your son's wedding got fixed as per his choice & as per your choice
[345.12] but you could have told me at least, what was the harm in telling me?
[349.49] oh Gulzaran, don't you worry. You will get a new dress & sweetmeats for sure
[353.21] yes! A new dress & sweetmeats. I will take money along with two new dresses
[358.57] the money & the dress is alright, but tell me what will you get?
[363.27] I won't get anything, but Murad will get some amount for the tractor
[368.72] amount for the tractor? I didn't get it
[372.90] I have informed Brother Khuda Baksh that Murad is buying a tractor for his field, so please assist him
[379.10] then, did he help you? Did you get the money for the tractor?
[384.17] A tractor is a very expensive thing, & Khuda Baksh doesn't have that much amount
[389.86] Fine! then he shouldn't give any money. Find some other family who can help us to buy the tractor
[396.19] oh wow! this is great
[400.51] You didn't inform me about it, but as I was passing by Khuda Baksh's house, I heard the sound of drums beating
[407.82] the girls were singing songs about marriage
[412.23] I felt like laughing, as their brother is special so how he will make arrangement for the wedding?
[420.07] Right?
By the way, whatever you have said now is really good
[424.16] stay firm on it, I have great proposals for your son. He doesn't lack any quality though
[431.03] also he is not so aged yet, but why were you in such a hurry?
[434.41] ok, do one thing
[436.39] if he doesn't give you money for the tractor, then I will show you another proposal
[441.23] just find a good proposal for my Murad
[442.97] stay firm on your words
I will!
[457.83] what?
[459.53] half amount for the tractor
[461.61] what are you saying, Khuda Buksh?
[466.53] I had said "yes" for Anna's happiness on your basis
[472.34] now I am worried since that time that how will I arrange such a hefty amount
[476.86] this is the discussion between men
[479.42] if Tufail had been alive today, then the matter wouldn't have reached to this extent
[483.44] his wife is unable to understand anything
[485.83] hmm...
right?
[487.23] she should have talked to you after seeing your stature, anyways don't worry
[491.54] I will personally talk to sister Kulsoom
[496.76] Okay
[498.21] I will sell off my land
[502.95] but...
[504.56] it cannot be sold so quickly
[508.13] I will sell it off after getting free from the wedding
[510.54] oh Khuda Buksh, I promise you. I will help you for sure
[516.69] Anna is not only your daughter but mine too
[519.30] but... tractor is a very expensive thing my brother
[525.16] but man, I cannot refuse now
[529.43] ok Khuda Buksh don't worry, you know I have a cattle business
[534.37] and I honestly don't know the prices of these tractors
[540.24] get the price of a tractor, then we'll see what needs to be done
[544.33] brother Ali Sher, thank you so much!
[547.09] Soon I will return your money after getting free from the wedding
[552.26] Oh man, that's another matter. First, check how much expense this wedding will incur
[557.82] so that we can arrange that much
[559.92] okay, I am leaving now. Thank you so much
[564.59] okay, bye!
[567.08] bye!
[598.93] who is it?
[600.51] its me, Murad
[603.36] who?
[604.47] Anna, this is me Murad
[606.76] but dad is not at home
[609.06] I had an idea that uncle won't be home
[614.33] actually I wanted to meet you & discuss an important matter
[618.54] with me?
[620.15] yes, with you
[634.94] Anna, look, I know our marriage is fixed and it's not appropriate for me to come here like this, but...
[644.35] its very important to discuss the matter
[646.99] that's why I had to come
[648.79] actually I was about to tell uncle in the morning that he shouldn't worry about my mom's demand
[653.98] which demand?
[655.51] about the money
[659.43] which money?
[661.41] I wanted to buy a tractor for my fields
[667.44] and I am collecting money for it
[670.33] so when our marriage got fixed then
[673.54] My mother asked your father to give some money for the tractor
[679.12] but dad didn't tell me any such thing
[684.78] but now I have understood
[687.17] that why he was so worried
[694.43] I am guilty Anna, my mother's demand is not right
[699.13] And I don't need any money from uncle
[704.32] Anna, you are my life's biggest desire
[709.84] I just want you, nothing else
[712.94] and Anna, I will arrange the money & give it to you. You may give that money to my mother
[721.27] but my dad won't agree
[726.63] also I won't agree
[730.38] Anna, don't you like me?
[737.33] I do
[740.84] but not more than my father's self-respect
[744.13] so I swear upon your life Anna, I won't let uncle's self-respect get harmed at all
[748.68] I will go and explain to Mom that she should end this matter of money for the tractor
[761.02] you shall explain your mother
[764.84] to retract the condition regarding the money.
[769.55] if she won't step back
[773.11] then I will step back from this marriage
[783.45] No Anna, don't do this
[787.44] I cannot even imagine about it
[801.00] oho! what happened! God forgive me. What shall I tell you & what not
[807.94] here you are doing the wedding preparations & putting lace on the clothes
[813.65] you are doing full wedding preparations & there...
[816.14] there your son, before the marriage
oho! What shall I tell you & what not?
[823.75] oh God! What are you saying? What happened to Murad?
[827.52] I saw with my own eyes that Anna was hiding behind the door and whispering something to Murad
[837.58] and our Murad was standing nearby & answering her
[841.49] They were standing so close to each other as if they were lovers or something similar
[847.75] I couldn't see that, oh God forgive me
[851.87] Already I was not happy with this proposal
[854.04] oh sister, think in a calm manner. Whatever you did, you did with your own will
[859.02] Otherwise, I had plenty of proposals from girls who would have offered large dowries, including cows and buffaloes
[866.60] now bear it, since you have done it as per your will
[869.85] what I could have done, Murad wasn't agreeing
[872.33] I am suggesting you like a sister, there is still time. Handle everything
[876.40] my work is to make relations
[879.72] But I must say, Auntie, you seem to break off more relationships than you make
[885.37] oh God dear, what are you saying?
[888.98] whatever you heard. I saw you in front of uncle Khuda Buksh's house myself
[894.10] you were looking at us as if we were doing something wrong
[896.71] You were in the wrong! The way she saw you, someone else could have seen both of you the same way
[901.59] you could have been defamed.
What was the need for you to go to her house?
[905.97] and then what people would have thought about you & Anna?
[908.61] what anyone thinks or not, I don't know that mom
[912.37] but stop thinking wrong by following other people's words
[919.01] And look, Auntie Gulzaran, I beg you: stop causing fights in other people's homes
[925.69] Aunty, even if this proposal doesn't get finalized because of you, I will still come to your house to settle the fee for this proposal
[931.72] and for God sake, don't come to our house
[934.69] Very well said, dear! Anna hasn't come to your house after the wedding, and yet you are insulting your aunt
[941.63] Remember that time when I raised you and you grew up
[947.06] and today you are saying such things in front of me?
[950.37] ok Kausar, enough is enough. I am leaving now. Don't ever call me again. Ok?
[957.56] Gulzaran!
Gulzaran, at least listen to me
[960.23] there is no more Gulzaran
[978.16] Tell me, why you had gone to brother Khuda Baksh's house?
[982.97] Mom, you know very well that there are no other men in that house besides Uncle Khuda Buksh
[990.16] besides, he is an old & ill person
[993.46] he might need my help somehow, so I had gone to ask that
[998.85] don't explain me such things, I know all
[1003.20] and you had gone to ask this from Anna?
[1006.74] mom, I had gone to ask uncle but he wasn't at home
[1009.84] Murad, you knew it that uncle Khuda Buksh had gone out of the house for some work
[1015.26] you had gone there deliberately
[1017.58] its not like that mom, you are thinking wrong
[1023.03] for example if I had gone there, then what's the harm in it?
[1027.28] remove such old school thoughts from your mind
[1030.43] shall I tell you something, mom?
[1032.80] Relationships are not made of wealth and money; they are made with love
[1037.63] look, sit here
[1041.61] be happy in your son's happiness
[1044.23] I am doing this wedding for the sake of your happiness, else you know that I...
[1049.51] Mom, don't worry about the tractor. Your request for money has put Uncle into a big problem
[1055.82] he won't be able to do it
[1057.61] mom look, for God sake don't demand this amount from uncle
[1063.51] I promise you, soon I will buy a tractor & that too with my own money
[1105.09] Ali..
[1108.61] where were you since morning?
[1116.01] I was searching for you
[1120.04] See, your entire face is dirty
[1124.37] come, let me wash your face
[1126.59] come my brother, quickly get up. Good boy
[1132.90] sit here
[1147.35] Sher Ali you don't know me
[1150.71] with whom you have picked up the fight
[1156.00] Chaudhry Hashmat is not used to hearing a no!
[1160.64] Mr. Chaudhry, listen to me. Please listen...
[1175.33] oh! What have you done?
[1178.16] I haven't done anything
[1180.30] come with me, come here
[1184.42] Khuda Baksh, Chaudhry Hashmat...
[1186.66] oh...
[1191.09] now tell me, what we will do?
[1193.10] Khuda Baksh, believe me, I didn't do this intentionally. I don't know how the gunshot happened
[1199.54] come back to your senses, Ali Sher. You have done the murder
[1203.76] and that too not just any ordinary guy, but Chaudhry Hashmat
[1207.62] for God sake Khuda Baksh save me, save me by any means
[1212.59] what can I do?
[1214.90] you can do a lot, take this murder on your head
[1219.41] I will save you from the jail, I will take you out of it. I will hire an expensive lawyer
[1224.68] and I won't let you stay inside the jail, I promise you
[1228.23] what are you saying? Anna's marriage is round the corner & I have 3 other kids
[1236.00] how can I do this?
[1237.53] See, Anna's wedding cannot happen without money. I will spend money on her wedding
[1243.13] also I will do everything for the rest of the kids, I will educate them & marry them
[1248.42] just save me by any means for God sake, please
[1253.68] I will buy a tractor for Murad as well
[1256.99] I cannot do this, my kids will be ruined
[1260.93] look Khuda Baksh, a poor man's kids are already ruined
[1266.10] what do you have? Neither money, wealth, land or properties
[1271.20] See, I will do expense for your kids. I will give them money as well, also I will get you out of the jail
[1277.42] I will get them highly educated, but for God sake please save me
[1282.65] for God sake please save me
[1286.60] for God sake decide quickly before the police arrives here
[1290.61] take this murder on your head, I will fulfill all my promises that I have made to you
[1295.17] I will get you free from the jail, I will get your bail done
[1299.02] You will come out after a few days, and I will take care of yours and your kids' expenses for the entire life
[1304.13] I will sell off my land
please save me
[1308.05] but it cannot be sold so quickly
[1311.27] I will sell if off after the wedding
[1313.33] oh man, for God sake please save me
[1317.01] Okay Ali Sher
[1321.33] let me take this murder on my head
[1326.11] but you will do whatever you are saying
[1329.21] Don't you trust your best friend? I always keep helping you
[1334.80] see, I need your help now. Please help me
[1338.34] please save me
[1342.15] okay fine
[1345.17] okay
[1369.05] brother Murad
brother Murad...
[1371.68] brother Murad
[1373.34] brother Murad
[1375.14] what happened Akmal, why are you making so much of noise?
[1378.05] brother Murad, your uncle..
[1381.31] uncle Khuda Baksh, what happened to him?
[1383.44] your uncle Khuda Baksh has murdered Chaudhry Hashmat
[1387.45] what rubbish you are talking? Are you mad or what? How is this possible?
[1391.68] This matter has spread throughout the entire village, and the police have arrested him
[1395.45] No, no, there is some misunderstanding. Uncle cannot do this; he has never harmed anyone before.
[1401.17] I don't know, but everyone is saying this. Everyone who was present there saw it
[1409.93] okay let me see, just take care of the fields
[1427.80] oh! such a bad thing happened
[1433.53] what happened, Gulzaran?
[1437.16] Khuda Baksh has murdered Chaudhry Hashmat
[1441.89] I am dead, what are you saying Gulzaran?
[1445.33] oh! Kausar I am not saying this but the entire village is saying this
[1451.35] in fact the entire area is saying this
[1454.05] the police has arrested Khuda Baksh
[1460.32] oh God! how can brother Khuda Baksh do this?
[1465.53] No, he haven't done anything. He is such a calm person
[1468.52] oh Kausar, what do we know about anyone? Anything can happen anytime
[1474.05] they are very influential people, they are so powerful
[1477.76] I must say, take out your son Murad from this mess
[1481.89] God forbid if something happened & he got caught in this mess then what will happen. As it is, you have only one son
[1490.10] oh my God! where is my Murad?
[1493.55] Gulzaran check on him, don't know where my son must be
[1497.95] find him, let me go & check myself
[1500.80] hey wait, let me go. I saw him working in the fields a while ago
[1507.39] let me go & check. Just pray that God keep him in his protection
[1511.73] you are his mother, and a mother's prayer is very effective
[1515.89] oh... such a bad thing happened
[1521.56] oh God please protect my Murad
[1524.55] I have only one son
[1527.64] keep him away from this mess
[1535.30] oh Ali Sher
[1537.92] I took this step in compulsion
[1542.46] but now my brain is bursting while thinking
[1546.50] that when my daughters will get to know
[1550.14] what will happen then?
[1553.56] nothing will happen, Khuda Baksh
you are being worried for no reason
[1559.60] its just a matter of a few days only
[1561.63] I will get you out of here, I won't let you stay here
[1565.26] I will shut their mouth with the money
[1568.88] oh man...
[1571.98] just take care of my daughters
[1576.54] I did all this for their sake
[1580.67] Khuda Baksh, your daughters are my daughters. Don't worry
[1585.40] also you haven't come to stay here forever, I will set you free
[1589.53] I am having a discussion with the policemen
[1595.30] don't you worry
[1597.41] I am leaving now, see you tomorrow. Today, I have to speak to Chaudhry's family as well
[1604.70] Okay
[1605.46] don't you worry, I am telling you. Ok?
[1610.04] Bye!
bye!
[1614.08] This henna is very thick; it cannot be applied
[1618.05] sister, I have kept it deliberately. It will give a nice stain
[1624.95] I heard that the darker the henna stain, the more the groom loves you
[1628.72] oho...
[1632.08] both of you have become so shameless
[1634.87] anyways, add some water in it
[1637.60] let me add some water
[1641.14] Ali...
[1644.50] Oh! Girls, you are sitting here peacefully, while chaos has broken loose for you
[1653.01] Khuda Baksh...
Khuda Baksh
[1657.72] what happened to dad, aunty?
is he fine?
[1660.79] not fine, the police has arrested your father
[1666.92] police!
[1668.28] Why? What father did?
[1670.46] Khuda Baksh has murdered Chaudhry Hashmat
[1694.40] how can dad murder anyone?
[1696.45] how would I know? I know nothing
[1700.29] he is like my brother, may God save him. What shall I do? I don't understand anything
[1708.22] oh God give me courage & strength to tolerate this grief
[1712.34] okay I am leaving, bye!
[1716.97] nothing will happen to dad
[1719.72] I won't let anything happen to dad
[1742.22] Murad, tell me is that matter true?
[1746.17] yes mom, uncle Khuda Baksh has murdered Chaudhry Hashmat
[1751.74] what are you doing?
[1753.62] I am taking out the money, what else?
[1755.13] why?
[1756.75] Mom, Uncle has committed murder, and I am going to the police station. They need money over there
[1761.24] have you gone mad? Will you go to the police station now?
[1764.58] mom, who else will go there if I won't?
[1767.63] you've become so mad in Anna's love that you are spending your entire savings on her murderer father
[1775.92] Mom, uncle is not a murderer. Nor he is a cruel man
[1781.36] I don't know much about this matter, but I know that whatever Uncle did, he didn't do it intentionally
[1790.15] and the matter is not about Anna. I call him "uncle", so he is my uncle
[1797.17] Murad, he is Anna's father not your uncle
[1803.67] you don't have any blood relation with him
[1805.46] mom, relations are not only of blood. Relations are of love & emotions
[1810.85] which are more stronger than the blood relations & I have only this relation with him
[1815.46] and I will never let this relation break
[1818.95] and you have to understand that he needs me right now
[1823.76] I won't let you waste the amount that we have saved penny by penny for your tractor
[1830.04] oh mom, what's the value of this money?
we can earn money anytime, it will come again
[1836.10] absolutely not! Murad, I won't let you take this money at all
[1840.53] alright then mom!
[1843.22] keep this money safely, but remember my words
[1847.67] if you'll save this money
[1850.18] then you'll loose your son
[1855.87] Murad, why are you testing me again & again?
[1860.35] mom, I am telling you that we can earn the money again.
[1865.92] I promise you, I will not let you keep deprived of anything
[1876.22] okay Murad
[1877.71] do as you wish
[1880.33] thank you mom
[1896.54] Shado
[1898.37] lock the door from inside
[1900.74] I will go to the police station
[1902.16] but sister, you..
[1904.94] I cannot leave dad alone
[1907.45] I am leaving. Just take care of yourselves
[1916.50] Brother Murad, what had happened?
[1919.75] what will happen now?
[1921.85] See, don't you worry. God will make things better
[1926.59] how can dad murder anyone?
[1929.02] Anna look, I don't know about it & by the way I am going to meet uncle at the police station
[1934.30] I will also go
[1935.12] No no, I am here. I will go to the police station
[1939.03] just take care of all of them
[1941.20] Brother Murad
[1943.95] nothing will happen to dad, right?
[1946.57] if God wills nothing will happen to uncle. Trust in God, everything will be fine
