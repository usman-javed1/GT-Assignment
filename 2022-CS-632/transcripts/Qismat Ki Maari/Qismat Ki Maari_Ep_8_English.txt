Congratulations Shado, from today you too have become a Chaudharani. Eat or not Chau sahab, for God's sake, don't do this injustice, I will do as you say. Chaudhari is giving the news of his marriage, that of his funeral [music] For me there is news of marriage, for you there will be a funeral [music] I want to say that I don't want your younger sister Shado, I want to marry her, God, it should not happen that the second sister also gets covered up like the first one, like Anna, the pants of this cruelty get pulled up, are you crazy? You can see only that house in the whole body, there are other houses also, only Khuda Baksh has a daughter and no one else has daughters. I was thinking, why not bring the second Anna also in this car, then take maximum revenge from him For Murad Bhai's relation, you asked for time to think, that Murad Bhai, to whom you were ready to give your most beloved daughter Guddu, let me agree to your words [music] From today, hatred for Anna is over and love is over. Anna, Anna ji, Chani Saba, come and sit near me  Why are you sitting down? Come here and sit near me and listen to me. What was to happen has happened. Now what is the use of hating you for me? Chaudhary sahab should not come and you are the head of this house, you are the head of this house, after today you will not do any work, okay? [Music] Salam Charani ji, you had called me, give me orders, you say Bismillah [Music] Go Guddu son, you also go inside and sit down. Hala Gulzar ji Chaudharani ji what are your orders, what is the matter of orders, tell me this, these small marriages that you keep arranging, do you get any benefit from them or not, Charani ji, we manage to survive but until the relationship is confirmed, no one gives money, by Bismillah, when it gets confirmed somewhere, then we get a little bit [Music] Has Kausar Pahan asked for a marriage relation for her wish? O, for Anna's relationship also, she had demanded the money for a tractor and I feel that this demand has come again in her mind and see God  Baksh, ever since there has been a theft in my farm, Murad has gone out of my heart. Ali Sher brother, Murad is neither a thief nor a bad boy, but my heart is not accepting him for marriage. If your heart is not accepting it, then what is the compulsion in this, that the relationship should be done there only. And see, everything is given by God. The mother is greedy and the son is stealing. And you are guarding the house. From where are you coming? I had gone to Chaudhary sahab's house. Saba is a very pious lady. She helps me throughout the year and helps many widows like me secretly. Today, in front of my eyes, Chandrani Sahiba apologized to Anna. Ok brother, now I am leaving. May Allah keep the Chaudharys happy. Yes, Ali Sher brother, I told you that Khushiya introduced us to Anna and Vali also went to meet her and then he brought him home. Yes, Khushiya also came to me to tell about Murad and if there is a theft again, what will you do? And he had also brought proof with him and he also told about that person.  This is the person in front of whom Murad had talked about the animal, brother Murad, but I cannot doubt this matter, okay, then it is as you wish [Music] I am not surprised at their prayers because I know that these are deceitful people, may Allah keep my family away from their deceit, I have seen Anna ji, my mother has listened to me, now they should never do anything bad to you Chaudhary Guddu sahab, you are an innocent child, how would you know that not only I but you too have become the target of their cruelty [Music] Anna ji, are you happy, I will ask you for food [Music] [Laughter] Gulzar had come to Ali Sher's home, what is the work of aunt Gujra at Abba home, she was coming from Chaudhary sahab's house, she stopped near us on the way, she was telling that Chaudharani sahiba has apologized to Anna in front of me and she was also telling that Chaudharani sahiba has borne the expenses of many widows like me and Chaudhary Khushiya helps many orphanages and hospitals in the city, wow, what a thing it is  Some people appear one thing but are something else from inside, only Allah knows, father, how wrong we misunderstood them, may God forgive us [Music] Chaudharani Sahiba, you come to my house, what is the name of your son, he is very cool, a very cute child, his name is Wali, please forgive me, yesterday I behaved very rudely with Wali, if possible Bhai Sahiba, then you too can forgive me, Chaudharani Sahiba, the respect you have given me by coming to my house, I cannot repay it, and the way you are taking care of my Anna, what more do I need, but Bhai Sahib, I want your forgiveness, sister, why are you embarrassing me, who am I to forgive you, see Bhai Sahib, there has been a murder in our house, that is why you know, I get a little angry, but forgetting everything, I have come to your house to apologize to you, and if you do not listen to me, then I will understand that you have not forgiven me [Music] Actually, I came to your house in connection with the relationship that Khushiya had talked to you about  I have come today in front of my eyes Chandrani Sahiba apologized to Anna and told her Nakrani to serve Anna she is the daughter-in-law of this house [Music] Bhaisahab you did not reply to my request [Music] Okay Chaudharani Sahiba I accept this proposal you may bring the wedding procession this week itself [Music] Hey

Chaudharys' house, this is no small thing, thank you very much once again, Khuda Bakhsh Bhai, I have to convey this news to Anna as well, Anna is a big man  You will be happy, go now it is my responsibility to free your lands from occupation, you just have to identify which land is yours and if someone occupies the land of Chaudharis, such oppression is not good, well, please bless us brother, now give us permission [Music] [Music] This oppression cannot happen, please keep quiet [Music] go, O God, do your duty, my family members should not fall prey to the deceit of this person, let me tell you where have Ammi Jaan and Mamu Jaan gone today with sweets and for what purpose have they gone [Music] I know, just God, let my family members also know, I understand [Music] no, Chaudhary Guddu sahab, you will not understand, then the same Chaudhary Guddu, you should just call me Guddu and why does everyone tell me that you will not understand, you teach me a lesson, I understand, if you explain this to me as well, then I will understand, for now, please explain to me one thing, is your Khushia Mamu married? Khushia Mamu has married three times and where are those three, two have been married  Mamu had divorced her and she is angry with another Mamu Well, how did he treat the ones whom he divorced, Mamu used to beat them and how did he treat the one who went away angry, Mamu doesn't say anything to them, he is afraid of them because he is a bigger Chaudhari [sangeet] than me It is very good that she has been arranged, now you see how I will teach her a lesson It is a good thing, Anna, you know where we went and for what purpose we went, we have arranged for another maid in the house, the maid too is the daughter of the enemy and we will keep her as a shoe for your feet, Chau Sahib, for God's sake, don't do this cruelty, I will do as you say, I will serve you, don't develop a relationship with my sister, the relationship has been confirmed, after three days, Khuda Baksh's daughter will be at our mercy and kindness Chauni Sahiba, for God's sake, don't do this, I will serve you as you say, don't bring my sister here, girl, the cruelty that your father did to us, you cannot see that, young me  I have made me a widow, my son an orphan, now you see what I do to him, when God forbid, every moment will ache, that day my heart will get cold, Baazi, give me leave, give me leave, and now this much cruelty is not right [Music] Sonna, this is what we have to do, whatever you can do, do it, otherwise you will get out of here, go with Rajo and Bhakta and clean the mansion [Music] Amma Jaan, Mamu Jaan, yes sir, why are you behaving like this [Music] Hey Abba, Abba, Sado, Sado, cry, cry, oh son, girls cry at the time of their departure, what is the problem in this, hey Sadhu, cry, cry, ok, let's go friends [Music] Come on, you both are crying as if there has been a dead body in this house, God forbid, Abba, is this news any less than a dead body, you were in such a hurry to give the verdict, Abba, even before giving the verdict of death sentence, time is given, what do you two sisters think that in the houses of Chaudharis, relations are made as a punishment and  No my son it is not like that, it was just an accident with Anna, to erase that accident I am doing this relation so that hatred also ends and Anna's punishment also ends, Abba, what is the need for him to take revenge and bring us and Abba, what is the guarantee that what you are thinking is true, the biggest proof of this is that Chaudharani Sahiba herself came to our house when her husband was murdered, still she forgot everything and came herself, apologized, asked for the relation and what do we need, that son Sona, God knows, I am doing this relation only for Anna's sake so that he gets happiness and his punishment gets reduced, still if you think that I am guilty and Anna keeps getting this punishment, then fine, I will go and make the Chaudharis refuse it, wait Abba, if it is about Anna baaji, then not only the relation, I also accept it, you say yes to her [ music] brother [music] and Jamra sahab [laughter] I have come to give you a very good news, those relations that were supposed to happen to you, could not happen to you Now he has become mine, he must not have informed you about this, I thought I should inform him now so much oppression is not right next Friday Chaudhary, Khursheed and Khushiya's wedding procession will go with great pomp, please participate and gain rewards Chaudhary is telling the news of his marriage, that of his funeral [laughter] For me there is news of the marriage, for you it must be of the funeral, that is why I am telling it in the manner of the funeral, the wish went unfulfilled this time also the wish was not fulfilled now so much oppression is not right, God uncle Chaudhary, in the intoxication of wealth and power, you have forgotten one thing, the God who has taken your life, has taken your life and the day he puts the sword on you, then you will not be able to utter these words, neither will the oppression be right, it is right, it is right, the slow pace will see the betrayal [Music] [Music] There is no stone left unturned, come here, you have nothing to do except blowing on the mouse, the fire has burned once, I am thankful to you, today it has burned Smile and sit down I have been distributing sweets since morning While distributing sweets I got an idea I said I did not give sweets to Kausar's house Bha, I saved four full laddus I saved two for you and two for your son Raj ate them after saying Bismillah I know you like Moti Choor laddus I am coming from Chaudharis' house too Big drums are being played

the marriage in the house of the Chaudharys, the life will be known after three days, now you have seen it, but Khuda Baksh had asked for time for this so that he could give the decision in favour of the Chaudharys, he announced the decision, then the decision was in favour of the Chaudharys, uncle announced the decision of fate, the decision is yet to be announced, oh wow, the wedding procession is to come to Khuda Baksh's house after three days, still you are waiting for the decision of fate to console your heart, you are talking about three days  It doesn't take even a moment to change the fate Murad son, I don't understand these things of yours However, I have understood the power of God The second daughter is also being handed over to the enemies [Music] Shambhu, take this, today this
