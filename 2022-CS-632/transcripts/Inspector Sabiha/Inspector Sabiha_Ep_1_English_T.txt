[169.64] Don't come ahead!  Don't come ahead,
I'll kill him!
[172.64] I am telling you.  Don't come ahead!
I'm telling you I'll kill him!
[179.03] Kill!  Kill, kill!
[200.56] Good job, Sabiha.
[281.90] So?  How's everything going?
[287.41] Fine.
[289.67] I mean, as fine as it could be.
[297.37] It's a huge change.
[301.32] I never thought everything would change
so much so fast.
[308.30] When such a huge transition
happens in your life, so...
[313.37] it's natural for a person to get worried.  It
[316.80] doesn't matter who it is.
[319.00] It's completely natural.
[324.29] Change...
[327.41] can also be very uncomfortable
and painful.
[332.65] But this could also be a new start, right?
[336.97] It can open doors
[340.35] that'll make you feel better about
yourself once you get go them.
[344.98] It's possible that you'll see some
qualities, some strengths about yourself...
[352.05] that you didn't know you had in you
maybe.
[358.38] Change can be an opportunity
to redefine yourself.
[362.60] For your own self.
[366.56] Maybe you're right.
[370.23] But it's a little hard to see that
at this point.
[374.47] I'm alone, divorced...
[381.14] how will I raise a little girl?
[385.10] How will I survive in this society?
[389.99] What will happen in the future?
[394.25] I keep thinking about that all the time.
[398.53] It's natural to be scared of the unknown.
[402.22] But this is not the time to think
about your entire life.
[407.90] Right now, you're going through a
very small phase of a very long journey.
[415.60] You should just focus on that.
[418.97] One step in front of another and that's it.
[422.89] And I'm here to help you with that.
[428.44] And?
[430.35] How do you spend the day at home?
[434.69] Like you said...
[439.05] one step at a time.
[442.45] I'm trying to take it day by day.
[447.13] And I'm trying to form a routine.
[451.01] For me and for Azo.
[455.79] How is Aiza?
[459.77] How is she reacting to all of this?
[464.40] She's amazing.
[468.77] Sometimes I feel she is stronger than me.
[476.34] And smart too.
[482.88] And the shifting
isn't completed yet either.
[487.63] We're unpacking things.
[544.48] Kasoor, 2017...
[548.17] and eight-year-old kid, Ghazala,
like everyday
[551.20] she leaves her house for school at 7 a.m.
after having breakfast with her family.
[563.54] Her van stops approximately
1 kilometre away from the house.
[569.27] Her van driver provides pick and drop to
her and some neighborhood kids from there.
[580.14] The neighborhood has employed a sweeper
that sees Ghazala going there every day.
[599.21] There's a general store outside of the
neighborhood that opens at 7:15 a.m.
[605.90] The owner of the store sees Ghazala
going through there every day.
[612.00] On 7th of July, Ghazala leaves her school,
but she doesn't get to her van.
[620.58] The sweeper doesn't see her,
the general store owner doesn't see her.
[625.25] The van driver also leaves
after waiting for five minutes.
[629.80] When the kid doesn't
return home till evening,
[631.81] the parents get worried
and start asking around.
[634.86] They find out that the kid didn't reach
the school either.
[638.49] This spreads throughout the neighborhood
by night.
[641.42] Announcements are made from the mosques
and the search starts.
[646.05] The police get a call at 9 p.m.,
but before the ASP even gets there...
[652.74] some kilo meters away,
the kid's dead body...
[659.67] is found from this trash site.
[675.23] Forensic report...
[678.91] rape.
[681.14] The little girl struggled.
There were bruises on her body.
[685.29] Cause of death...
[688.28] asphyxiation.
[690.85] The little girl was killed by choking.
[697.44] Where will the police investigation
form start?
[701.62] Who is your suspect and why?
[710.14] Yes?
[717.37] Come in, child.  Sit.
[726.82] Rizwan told me that your progress has been
really good.
[731.86] Thank you, Sir.
[736.63] Now I've become "sir" too?
[740.69] Yes, Sir.
[744.22] I'll never get used to this "Sir".
[748.49] How is Aiza?
[754.41] Cadet Sabiha...
[757.44] I've asked you a question.
[760.88] How is your daughter?
[764.89] My daughter is fine, Sir.
[767.30] We've recently shifted.
We're settling in.
[773.54] This is why I've called you here today.
This training is very important.
[779.38] But you've got to pay full attention
to Aiza amidst all of this.
[786.00] I don't want her to be neglected.
[790.76] ok?
[793.99] Sir!
[797.21] Do you have any other problems?
[801.09] No, Sir.
[808.40] Okay, you can go.  Good.
[812.62] Thank you, Sir.
[816.63] And listen.
[819.53] Sir.
[821.73] Give my regards to your mother
if you speak to her.
[824.83] Tell her that Uncle Akbar said
that he would visit on Sunday.
[828.36] Make biryani for dinner.  Is everything right?
[834.02] Sir!
[851.72] -How's your school going, child?  -It
's nice.
[855.80] - Did you make any friends?  -You do
n't make friends so fast.
[859.57] I'll inspect, think it through
and then befriend people.
[863.95] And how are your classes going?
[867.30] They're going good, child.
[869.72] - I'm getting to learn a lot.
- Did you make any friends?
[874.22] You don't make friends so fast.
[876.34] I'll inspect, think it through
and then befriend people.
[879.21] Very good!  Besides, we have each other,
right?
[883.99] We have Nano, Uncle Sameer, and Baba.
[893.50] Azo, my love...
[895.88] Baba is only there for you.
[902.97] - Azo, should I serve you food?
-No, I am not hungry.
[908.60] Eat your dinner so that you can sleep.
You have school in the morning too.
[917.68] Let's do one thing.
[919.75] Should we eat chips?  Spicy ones?
[923.62] I'll eat chips!
[925.16] Sister, she had chips yesterday as well.
[927.48] It's not good to consume
so much oil every day.
[931.40] Shabana, we'll have chips for dinner.   Is
everything right?
[935.88] All right, Sister.  Azo, you wash
your hands.  I'll get the chips.
[962.77] Is Azo ready?
[965.18] She'll be ready in five minutes.
[967.89] Come inside.
[969.90] No, I'll wait in the car.
[972.63] Ahsan, come inside.  It's not an issue.
Please.
[981.29] Sit.
[983.44] No.  I'm okay.
[989.70] Great apartment.
[994.00] It's nice.
[996.70] That's enough for us.
[999.60] Besides, we're still setting it up, so...
[1005.01] And Aiza?
[1008.87] Obviously, for Azo too.
[1011.23] She's decorating her room by her choice.
[1014.38] She'll be fine.
[1016.90] All of this might be okay for you, but...
[1020.98] Aiza isn't used to a life like this.
[1024.91] Ahsan, nobody knows what's good for
my daughter and what isn't better than me.
[1030.63] Our...daughter.
[1034.15] Right.  Our daughter.
[1038.53] That's the only reason
you're standing here today.
[1046.34] I can understand
it must be really tough for you.
[1050.66] Every divorce has its own challenges.
Especially if there are kids involved too.
[1058.43] I just don't want my daughter to suffer
because of my decisions.
[1065.41] You're a mother.
[1067.24] Even during this difficult time,
your first priority is your daughter.
[1072.63] No mother can see their kids in pain.
[1077.25] To protect them is our basic instinct.
[1080.74] But you'll only be able to look after her
if you're fine yourself.
[1088.89] I'm fine.
[1097.27] I'm always fine.
[1101.36] Everything seems fine from the outside.
[1105.13] We suppress our feelings and keep going on.
[1111.64] But to suppress everything like this,
[1115.25] it's not good for you long term.  Is it
[1118.92] possible that there is a storm hiding
inside this peace that...
[1124.53] will take everything with it?
[1140.04] Whatever I've seen,
the pain that I've gone through... I
[1145.15] can never let my daughter go through that
pain.
[1151.17] I will not punish my daughter
for my decisions.
[1183.53] Yes, yes.  You don't worry at all.
I've called her parents.
[1188.26] Yes, yes.  I'll let you know as soon
as I speak to them.
[1195.31] -May I come in?
- Come, come.
[1198.03] Please come.
[1200.62] Come, sit.
[1204.19] Sorry, Mr.  Shah, for calling you during
working hours.
[1207.66] I know you're very busy.  It
[1210.76] doesn't matter.  But what has happened here?
[1214.62] Sabiha has been having a problem
with a student since the last few days.
[1217.93] And I noticed it too.
But it crossed a line today.  -Both
[1222.00] of them had a physical altercation.
-No, Ma'am.
[1224.88] - I didn't start the fight.  Sania just--
- Quiet!
[1229.16] We're talking, right?
[1230.94] One of my students is admitted to a
hospital and it is because of your daughter.
[1236.73] Which girl did you fight?
[1238.28] It's not a girl, but a boy.  Muhammad Amjad.
He's her class fellow.
[1243.34] Your daughter cracked open his skull!
Do you know how angry his parents are?
[1248.39] They've asked me to suspend your daughter
right away.
[1252.61] And I'm going to do it!
[1254.69] But Sabiha is saying that she didn't start
the fight.
[1258.90] Did you ask the other classmates
what happened?
[1261.55] Look, I have no need to ask others.
[1265.03] One of my students is admitted
in a hospital.
[1267.17] And this is all because of your daughter.
[1268.97] I didn't start it, Ma'am.
Amjad used to bother Sania everyday.
[1273.18] He bullied her.  She cries everyday.
[1276.16] And I told him not to do it multiple times
but he fought with me too.
[1280.51] And today when he bullied Sania
and I intervened,
[1284.39] so he started fighting with me and--
[1287.19] You should've come to me.  Who gave you
the right to do it all by yourself?
[1293.11] All due respect, Ma'am...
[1295.29] I'm a policeman.  Both parties come to me,
we listen to everyone.
[1300.09] But you labeled my daughter as the
guilty party without even listening to her.
[1304.07] Sorry, Mr.  Shah.
This is not your police station.
[1307.90] One of my students is admitted in
a hospital and I'm answerable for it.
[1312.02] And my final decision is to suspend
your daughter.
[1318.59] Then you should hear my decision too.
[1321.17] I want to take my daughter far away
for a week from a place where
[1325.31] she was protecting her class fellow
and she's being punished for it.
[1331.79] What are you teaching the kids?
[1335.56] Very sad.
[1338.62] Let's go, Sabiha.
[1341.68] And yes.
[1343.63] I've decided that my daughter will attend
karate classes for a week.
[1348.40] So that if it ever happens again,
she's not hurt.
[1371.96] Baba, what did you do?  You got me suspended
for two weeks instead of one?
[1378.34] Oh, forget it.  We'll enjoy a lot
these two weeks.
[1381.18] And besides, when do we ever get time
to enjoy together?
[1388.88] - Is the pain too much?
-No, I'm fine.
[1391.64] Brave girl.
[1394.05] Sorry, Baba.  Mama will be very angry,
right?
[1399.57] Oh, you didn't do anything wrong.
[1402.16] You stood for a weak person
against a powerful one.
[1405.74] I am proud of you.
[1409.95] In your life, you...
[1412.87] have to fight sometimes.
[1415.44] And in the future, you'll have to
fight these battles again and again.
[1420.73] Child, remembers one thing.
[1423.42] Whenever you fight...
[1425.28] fight for a purpose.
[1428.01] And when you fight for that purpose,
[1430.62] then fight without fear.
[1433.68] And if you have to fight...
[1436.70] always fight to win.
[1447.16] I'm amazed and he's worried.
[1449.77] I asked was it a boy, she said yes.
I asked where is he?
[1453.00] She said Sabiha cracked open his skull
and he's at the hospital.
[1457.55] A boy's?  Our Sabiha did it?
[1459.71] Man, Sabiha, that was amazing.
You're just like your father.
[1462.74] Very good.  Amazing!
[1465.03] Brother Akbar, please.
At least you don't encourage her.
[1468.84] Oh, you just give me yakhni pulao.
That's it.
[1471.86] Don't know what he's turning his daughter
into.
[1475.27] Nice!  There, the principal suspended
the daughter.
[1479.53] And here?  Here the wife is suspending
her husband.
[1485.59] But between us,
Sabiha did the right thing to that guy.
[1488.84] Now he's gonna think 100 times
before bullying someone.
[1492.44] Oh, not a 100. He's gonna
think a 1000 times!  Very good.
[1496.70] Please Shah!  How much more are you gonna
spoil her?
[1499.82] I'm the one who has to handle it later.
[1503.59] How is she going to spend these two weeks
out of school?
[1507.79] She is going to take karate classes.  Do
[1515.35] you think it's funny?
[1521.30] Brother Akbar,
we know about your whereabouts.
[1524.60] How is he?  Where is he?
We knew nothing about him for weeks.
[1529.90] Do you have any idea how I spend this time?
[1533.35] I wake up at night to pray for you
in case something happened to you.
[1537.45] Oh God, protect him!
[1540.37] I don't even know if you think so or not.
[1543.06] But if something happened to you,
so...
[1546.24] what will become of us?
[1550.45] Oh, Khadija, nothing will happen.
You're getting worried for no reason.
[1554.13] Shah, I'm not getting worried needlessly
and all three of us know that.
[1559.30] Why are you putting your life
through so much danger?
[1562.95] Is your duty above your family?
[1568.38] Yes.
[1570.74] If I won't do it...
[1573.28] then someone else will do it.
[1576.21] He must have a family too, right?
[1578.81] Man, someone has to do it, right?
[1581.76] For us, for our kids.
[1593.09] All right.
[1594.73] Do whatever you want.
[1599.02] Go and perform your duty.
[1601.06] We can all go to hell.
[1603.48] You go on and perform your duty.
[1625.58] Sister-in-law is right, man.
You should think about it.
[1630.52] These undercover assignments
are very dangerous.
[1634.47] You talk to the boss
and get yourself transferred.
[1639.85] I've gotten to him
after a lot of hard work, Akbar.
[1643.80] After getting so close,
[1646.55] I can't just leave it in the middle.
Impossible.
[1650.65] Man, what are you doing?
[1653.54] You guys are about to have another baby.
[1657.06] Leave it, man.  Think about your family.
what are you doing?
[1661.33] It won't take a lot of time.
[1664.70] There's a shipment
coming in from Afghanistan
[1666.33] and he's asked me to oversee it.
[1669.53] You just tell the boss to be prepared.
I'll let you know as soon as I get a tip.
[1675.50] Nobody should even get a wind of it though.
[1679.17] Not even within the force.
[1681.32] He has his people inside.
[1683.20] -Just you and I and the boss.
-Man!
[1686.14] Oh, nothing will happen.
[1689.81] Rehman has full trust in me.
He doesn't even know who I am.
[1695.82] Nothing will happen to me.
[1700.09] And you're there to save me.
[1702.87] Can something happen to me
when you're there?
[1705.82] Just...
[1708.29] you wait and see.
[1714.19] Everything will be fine.
[1722.58] Baba!
[1730.85] You didn't sleep yet?
[1733.77] Baba, don't go.  Please.
[1736.73] Why, child?
[1738.57] I'm getting scared.  Please don't go.
[1742.30] What's there to get scared of?
[1744.99] I'll be back in a few days.
[1748.46] I want you to be a strong girl.
[1752.46] You have to take care of the house after me.
You're grown up now!
[1760.09] I love you.
[1762.14] I love you too.
[1788.75] Standard issue Beretta 92 fs pistol.
[1794.46] This will be your main weapon.
[1797.99] Forever with you on the field.
[1801.00] Your partner.
[1806.04] A police officer never...
[1810.53] uses their weapon needlessly
and without thinking.
[1814.88] But if you had to take it out...
[1817.61] you can't miss your target.
[1822.83] Is that clear?
[1828.81] Pick up the weapon in front of you.
[1831.70] And load it.
[1846.20] On my mark...
[1849.88] ready?
[1856.63] Aim!
[1859.50] Fire!
[1867.36] Again.
[1870.21] Ready?
[1872.74] Aim!
[1874.82] Fire!
[1896.06] Fire!
[1899.43] Sabiha, fire.
[1901.53] Sir, give her a blaster gun again.
That'll be good for her.
[1906.83] Quiet!
[1913.02] What happened, cadet?
[1915.30] Why are you not firing?
[1918.07] - Sir, I got dizzy.
-You got dizzy?
[1921.57] If someone was shooting at you in
the field, what will you say to them?
[1925.18] You got dizzy?
[1927.20] All the others were firing too!
[1931.97] Take aim at them and fire.
[1937.67] Aim!
[1939.90] And fire!
[1946.87] Again!
[1949.53] Aim!
[1952.16] Fire!
[1955.44] Sabiha, fire!
[1958.99] Again, ready!
[1962.41] Aim!
[1964.98] Fire!
[1985.59] And once again.
[1988.23] Ready!
[1990.67] Aim!
[1993.80] Theory- top of the class.
[1996.66] Investigation- top of the class.
[2000.45] Tactical training – top of the class.
[2005.18] Weapon training...
[2010.09] last position.
[2014.74] Rizwan was telling me that...
[2017.53] you couldn't even fire once.
[2021.07] Why?
[2024.13] S... Sir, it's just...
[2031.03] Sabiha, talk to me properly.
[2036.07] Uncle Akbar, I don't know what happened.
[2039.39] I felt as if I had darkness in front of
my eyes at the time of the shooting.
[2044.16] I couldn't understand anything.  I was dizzy
and I felt as if I'd pass away.
[2049.85] Look, child, when you stubbornly joined
the police force...
[2055.64] I advised you then too... that
[2058.54] this isn't for everyone to do.
[2063.49] You were good at your studies.
[2066.28] You excelled at it too.
[2071.43] Working in a police force is very brutal.
Who knows it better than you?
[2076.78] Anyway, there's still time.
You can change careers if you want.
[2085.24] No, Uncle.
[2087.15] I'll work hard and try harder.
[2091.47] Not everything can be solved by trying
and hard work.
[2099.11] I can't just leave it in the middle
when I've come so far.
[2106.94] You're really your father's daughter.
[2111.90] He used to say the same thing.
[2117.93] There's something wrong.
[2119.69] It can't be
that he'll miss Sabiha's birthday.
[2123.68] You... you please find it out.
[2126.50] Please find out.  S
something is not right.
[2132.82] I've inquired from all my informants.
[2135.81] There's no news of Shah.
[2137.98] - But we're trying--
- What do you mean by that?
[2140.90] I don't know.
[2142.49] I want my husband alive and well
at my home right now!
[2148.05] You people sent him, right?
You people sent him!
[2151.75] You're going to bring him back.  Do
you understand?
[2155.13] Do something!  Brother Akbar, do something.
[2159.40] Do something, Brother Akbar!
[2181.41] Let's talk about your father.
[2185.25] My father?
[2192.81] He was a good man.
[2195.28] Oh, man, someone has to do it, right?
[2198.26] For us.  For our kids.
[2202.81] If I won't do it...
[2205.39] then someone else will do it.
[2207.37] He'll have a family too, right?
[2211.64] A good father.
[2213.73] - I love you.
- I love you.
