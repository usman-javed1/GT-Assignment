[55.59] Come in.
[71.49] ASP Sabiha Shah,
the reason for this inquiry
[75.09] is the incident regarding the
investigation from 13th till 15th October.
[79.31] You're accused of unlawful use of power,
misconduct, and violation of police protocols.
[85.64] - Do you understand these charges?
-Yes, Sir.
[89.71] This is not a court.
This is just an internal investigation.
[94.41] But if the department felt the need
to file a case against you,
[99.91] then the evidence presented against
you here can be used in the court.
[105.18] - Do you understand?
- Sir.
[109.52] Abdul Rehman Zakir, alias Rehman Lala.
[114.48] This man was on the Police's most wanted list.
[119.73] How did you get him?
[129.53] I worked with Shakir Bhai for two years.
(brother)
[133.66] When we found his dead body then
we found that he was a policeman.
[138.68] I couldn't believe it.
[140.91] Rehman Lala used to trust him a lot.
[145.23] -What did he do for Rehman?
-Whatever Lala asked him to.
[150.32] Smuggling shipments used to come,
he used to handle those.
[154.92] Picking up stuff from one place
and dropping it off at another.
[159.48] He would break people's legs sometimes
if the payments were due.  Anything!
[166.33] And Shakir?
[168.83] Shakir bhai used to be with him too.
[171.71] He was a little educated
so Lala made him the in charge.
[177.72] Who killed Shakir?
[181.25] what can we say?
[183.56] I just heard that he got into a fight
with Rehman Lala.
[188.54] I don't know whether it was something
money related or what.
[192.88] I don't know anything.
[196.23] Where is Rehman?
[200.53] Why?  Do you want to avenge your father?
[213.57] - Salam.
- Salam.
[224.04] I don't want revenge.
[227.27] I just need the truth.
[231.48] The truth is,
[233.36] Rehman Lala is lost despite being in front
of our eyes.
[238.89] No one can catch him.  Do you know why?
[242.95] Because from a jailer to the minister;
everyone's in his pocket.
[251.70] I want to get to Rehman.
[259.08] And you'll take me.
[266.58] I can ruin your life with one order.
[272.09] How much of my life is even left, SP Madam.
[276.52] Cancer has eaten my entire body.
[281.31] There's nothing left for you.
[293.17] -Salam, Dad.
- Salam.
[295.54] - Salam.
- Salam.
[306.36] I can protect you.
[309.29] And your family too.
[313.07] But only on this condition
that you'll take me to Rehman yourself.
[320.76] Otherwise do remember one thing.
[325.29] No one will be more dangerous for you
than I am.
[330.87] I am thinking about my family.
[333.32] That's why I'm saying no.
[337.18] Because there are even more
dangerous animals than you in this jungle.
[347.71] You're gonna be well in a few days.
Are you feeling better now?
[351.52] What do you want to do after this?
what do you want to do?
[354.68] Bacha Party and go to the water park.
[377.37] I gave her the medicines.
The pain is a lot better now.
[383.86] I'll leave now.
[394.04] I know your job timings are very odd.
[397.02] If you ever need me, call me.
[402.19] Thank you.
[422.38] How are you, my love?
[424.31] - Better?
- And the pain?
[427.18] The pain is still there a little
but it is better.
[432.75] Aazo...
[436.64] child, I'm sorry.
Mama leaves you again and again.
[441.83] But, my love...
[444.49] don't think that mama doesn't love you.
[447.78] I love you so much more than anything
in this world.
[452.75] I know, Mama.  Nadia Auntie
says your mama is a police officer.
[457.29] She needs to keep everyone safe.
[459.80] Not just me.
So I understand and I am very proud of you.
[482.95] ASP Sabiha.
[485.16] Madam, this is Ghazala.  Ashraf's wife.
[488.65] yes, what is it?
[491.11] Can I meet you?  Regarding Rehman.
[498.35] Sure, you can come to the office
whenever you want.
[500.94] Not at the office, Madam.  It'll be an issue
if someone saw me there.
[505.65] Rehman's men are everywhere.
[507.97] Please do me a favor and come home.
[511.10] All right.
[512.97] - I'll come.
- Madam, hurry up.
[517.71] Time is really less.
[520.25] Okay.
[529.03] Come, madam, come.
[531.46] Come, madam.
[533.48] - Salam.
- Salam.
[535.96] Sit down, madam.
[558.12] Rehman Lala is hiding in front of our eyes.
[561.85] But I'll take you to him.
[565.19] No one from your department should know
about this.
[571.14] Everyone protects him.
[574.51] Lala has everyone's secrets.
[583.43] If this got out, you won't be
safe and neither will I or my family.
[590.98] Rehman Lala's station...
[593.72] is surrounded by his
people on all four sides.
[598.51] recognize me.  They won't stop me.
[603.14] But you won't be able to go in the uniform.
[606.67] They'll kill you in the street.
[618.77] But I have a few stipulations.
[623.43] Stipulations?
[626.11] Tell me.
[631.32] My daughter...
[634.69] From today onwards,
my daughter is your responsibility.
[639.13] Her education, her future,
you'll look after it all.
[646.41] Promise me?
[649.97] Promises.
[653.82] You'll send my wife money every week.
[665.46] And one more important thing,
the most important thing,
[669.58] that you'll have to do for me.
[698.96] Baji?  (sister)
[700.96] Is everything right?
[703.48] You look worried.
[706.82] Everything's fine.
[710.91] - Okay, listen.
- Yes, Baji?  -I
[713.57] have to go out for some work.  -Yes
.
[716.34] If Aazo wakes up after I leave,
tell her mama will be back soon.
[721.52] Okay, all right.
[725.48] -Take care of here.
-Yes, sister.
[728.65] Go.
[743.88] I've made a lot of mistakes in life.
[748.52] Maybe I didn't do justice to you either.
[756.16] Forgive me for it if possible.
[762.46] Seeing you two together like this before...
[765.95] it used to fill me with rage.
[769.79] But I feel happy now.
[772.92] It's my heartfelt prayer that both of you
stay happy together like this.  -Is
[780.27] everything right?
-Everything's fine.
[786.07] I'll get busier with work
in the future maybe.
[793.24] Actually, I came to make a request to
the two of you that if I, for any reason,
[799.42] am not able to look after Aazo...
[806.02] Please always raise her as your daughter.
[811.87] Aazo is your daughter.
[815.09] And she will always be your daughter.
[819.19] And if she ever needs us,
we're always here for her.
[824.65] I'm proud of what you've just said.
[828.32] I know, Sabiha.
[830.49] It takes a lot.
[833.63] But do you know what?
[836.69] Love is something...
[839.50] that isn't lessened when you share it.
[842.03] It only increases.
[846.01] And look...
[848.60] Aiza is so lucky, right?
[851.39] There are so many people that love her.
Right?
[858.68] Thank you.
[865.92] I'll leave now.
[867.92] I only came here to say this.
[892.67] What were you doing near
Rehman Zakir's camp with Ashraf?
[897.25] During the investigation Ashraf accepted
[899.86] that not only does he know
about Abdur Rehman Zakir's spot,
[902.92] he can also show it to me.
[905.49] You asked and he agreed?  What
were you giving him in return for this?
[909.68] He was a poor man, Sir.  And I'm sick too.
[912.43] Lung cancer.  So I agreed to do this
in exchange for a little money.
[916.90] According to eyewitnesses,
before the shootout,
[919.34] a woman clad in a burka was seen
with Ashraf Ali.
[923.41] But there is nothing
about her in your report.
[928.56] Sir, I didn't see any
woman clad in a burka there.
[931.28] I would've surely mentioned
her in my report had I seen her.
[982.22] yes, Ashraf?  Are
[984.65] you still alive?
[988.35] There...
[992.42] You can call this life.
[996.02] Yes, Lala, I am alive.
[1001.52] Everyone has to die one day.
[1005.46] Something with a bullet.
[1008.01] Some because of cancer.
[1010.26] And some of old age.
[1013.09] Everyone has to die one day.
[1020.62] Are you doing something these days?
[1024.38] No, Lala.
[1027.02] I can't even breathe
when I walk to the bathroom.
[1031.63] How will I work?
[1034.66] You never took care of me either.
[1038.57] I gave my entire life to you.
[1043.06] Why?
[1046.25] Didn't you get the money?
[1051.00] It's very clear with us, man.
Do you job and earn money.
[1057.94] And the rest is charity to the mosque.
[1069.45] Who is this?
[1072.53] Is she your daughter?
[1075.30] No.
[1077.73] Then?
[1080.65] She is Shakir Bhai's daughter.
[1088.99] Not Shakir's.
[1093.35] I am Inspector Saeed Shah's daughter.
[1098.72] The same eyes,
[1101.69] the same attitude...
[1105.22] I remember everything.
[1109.43] what have you come here for?
[1113.01] I've just come here to see...
[1115.67] the man who killed me.
[1119.73] The one who made my mother a widow
and me and my brother orphans.
[1124.86] And why?
[1127.86] Why?
[1131.47] You don't go into the
lion's den to hunt it.
[1137.89] You aim for it sitting afar.
[1143.19] This is the only mistake Shakir made.
[1147.77] His name was not Shakir.
[1151.50] He was Shakir for me.
[1157.01] I made him sit with me...
[1159.61] I loved him more than brothers.
[1163.08] And what did he do to me?
[1166.97] He was cutting my roots!
[1170.76] What would I have done?
[1173.83] I should've congratulated him
and sent him home?  -He
[1178.51] was performing his duty!
- I was also performing my duty.
[1183.05] It wasn't personal.
[1186.26] You tortured him.
[1188.87] You disrespected his dead body.
[1192.45] So that it becomes an example...
[1195.32] that what are the consequences
of cheating Rehman Lala.
[1201.84] Anyway...
[1205.80] what happened has happened.
[1211.11] I could've been punished by his family for this too
if I wanted.
[1219.25] But I didn't do it.
[1225.74] What more do you want from me?
[1232.46] A testimony?
[1234.91] Testimony?
[1236.96] A testimony for what?
[1240.48] The testimony that my father
was a loyal police officer.
[1244.36] And that he was performing his duty
and you killed him as a "shaheed".
[1251.68] He was killed because of me.
[1255.26] But I didn't make him a criminal
in the file.
[1259.18] Go ask his uniformed brothers.
They made him a criminal.
[1263.49] Go and ask them!
[1266.72] Who?
[1268.85] I need names.
[1278.34] Who are you?
[1280.58] You're sitting here in front of me
and ordering me around?
[1286.26] I'm only tolerating all of this
because you're Shakir's daughter.
[1289.96] If you spewed any more nonsense,
I'll throw you out of here!
[1295.59] And you!
[1297.41] Our accounts have been settled, understand?
Get out of here!
[1302.09] Gogay!
[1305.70] Throw both of them out of the neighborhood.
[1308.25] And if you ever see them again,
just shoot them in the head.
[1322.29] You didn't inform anyone in the department, you
didn't take anyone back up.
[1326.66] And you went there alone.
[1329.29] Ashraf called me in the evening
on the way back home from work,
[1332.71] that he wants to meet him.
[1334.25] I thought he'd have to give me
some information, but I didn't know
[1337.35] that Rehman's men were ready for an ambush.
[1347.37] Go, get lost from here!
And don't show your face here again!
[1361.21] How did the encounter start?
[1369.17] When I reached the meeting point, so Ashraf
and Rehman's guard Ghazanfar alias Gogi,
[1373.44] they were already waiting for me.
[1375.68] As soon as Ashraf saw me, he took
out his pistol and started shooting.
[1421.68] Without a warrant, without any back up,
alone;
[1426.44] why did you enter Rehman Zakir's building?
[1431.53] Sir, a criminal fired a bullet
at a police officer.
[1434.79] I was shot at from inside the building.
[1440.87] And is it all a coincidence
that it was Rehman Lala's building...
[1446.01] who was involved in the murder
of your father?
[1448.89] Coincidence?
[1451.06] No.
[1452.84] Justice.
[1512.35] And one more thing.  The most important thing...
[1516.98] that you'll have to do for me.
[1519.64] If I come alive from there, then
everyone will know that I'm the informant.
[1526.98] My death has already been written.
[1529.38] But they won't spare my wife
and my daughter.
[1545.87] I promise.
[1567.13] No, no.
[1568.53] Please don't kill me, don't kill me.
[1571.59] My father must have said
the same thing to you.
[1574.49] No, I didn't-- I didn't kill your father.
[1578.50] - I didn't kill your father.  -Then
who did it?
[1584.82] Who killed my father?
[1622.51] I brought you into my home.
[1627.13] I fed you from my plate.
[1632.64] You still betrayed me.
[1637.52] Look, Rehman,
[1640.81] If you'll kill a policeman...
[1646.35] then you won't be spared alive either.
[1653.48] No.
[1656.59] You don't worry about that.
[1661.87] I've made all the arrangements for you.
[1671.44] Don't you want to know?
[1674.69] How did I find out about you?
[1686.57] Come.
[1710.45] Akbar.
[1713.42] Akbar.
[1720.33] Akbar!
[1727.01] Akbar.
[1737.52] If you won't be able to do it,
then let me know.
[1741.59] Are you with me...
[1749.11] Akbar!
[1770.85] Akbar.
[1787.06] Yes, come.
[1789.94] Come.
[1801.74] Come, come, come.
[1809.50] Sa...Sabiha.
[1814.86] Take care of Sabiha.
[1819.13] You'll take care of her, right?  I
[1822.41] promised you.
[1825.02] Promise me that...
[1847.20] I'll take care of everyone.
[1934.00] Sabiha, child, what am I hearing?
You did an amazing job!
[1939.48] How did you find that imbecile?
I thought God knows where he'd be.  Do
[1948.19] you know what is
the devil's biggest strength?
[1954.21] Lies, cheating.
[1959.07] He's right in front of your eyes, but...
[1961.91] you don't see him.
[1967.91] There's no statement here from Rehman.
Did he not tell you anything?
[1972.48] He told me.
[1974.68] Rehman told me everything.
[1979.13] But nothing is written in your report.
[1985.25] The thing is, I...
[1987.81] don't believe that much
in police reports now.
[1992.09] And besides, what is the point of writing
the truth in them?
[1997.61] Who knows it better than you?
[2001.76] What nonsense are you spewing?
[2007.85] You're the one who's been spewing nonsense
all your life with me.
[2017.77] Such a big lie?
[2020.75] Such a big lie?
[2023.97] I thought of you as my father
for my entire life and you--
[2029.35] You killed your friend?
[2032.55] You made him guilty in his file
after killing him?
[2037.53] What kind of man are you?
[2040.00] You snatched a husband from his wife,
and a father from his kids!  -And
[2045.00] then you got into that house-- -
Then what could I have done?
[2052.38] I told you a thousand times not to go
on that path!
[2057.22] Top to bottom,
[2058.67] the entire police department
was involved in that.
[2062.70] And he alone was out for "jihad".
[2067.56] If Rehman would've gone,
all of us would've gone too!
[2071.34] On one side, there was everyone.
And he was alone on the other side!
[2077.82] Idiot.
[2080.22] He was the flag bearer for honesty.
[2088.04] He was my brother.
[2091.89] I loved him!
[2095.19] And I killed him with my own two hands.
[2102.93] I cry everyday remembering him.
[2106.74] But he didn't leave me any choice!
[2113.22] If he would have stayed,
then all of us would have died.
[2115.14] Me, my wife, my kids!
[2118.16] His wife, his kids!  What about them?
[2122.53] You ruined their life.
Did you ever even once think about that?
[2125.45] I am not an animal!  I am a human.
[2129.67] I did whatever I could.
[2132.65] For you, for your brother, for your mother.
[2136.15] So that my hands get cleaned off his blood.
[2139.38] And look at you.  You're sitting
in front of me as an officer!
[2142.29] I must have done something right.
[2145.56] And the fire I've been
through to get here...
[2149.06] what about that?
[2150.85] Who's going to pay for that?
[2153.60] And who's going to pay
for my mother's tears?
[2155.56] I told you not to dig up old grievances!
[2158.03] What if a truth comes out
that you won't be able to bear?
[2161.04] That old grievance was my father's!
[2163.70] And you were the one who made him so!
[2169.03] Look, Sabiha, child--
[2170.86] Don't you dare!  Don't you dare
utter my name from your mouth!
[2180.93] I'm the DIG.
[2184.84] And you're the daughter
of a disgraced officer.
[2192.49] No one will believe you.
[2200.07] Your career will be ruined.
[2205.90] Madam, keep this pin.  Twist it around
and it'll start recording.  -It'll
[2211.61] record everything?
-Yes, it'll record everything.
[2230.95] No matter what you think of me...
[2234.14] but I consider you like my own children,
that's why I am telling you.
[2239.66] You can't do the system alone.
[2244.60] I told your father the same thing,
but he didn't listen.
[2249.61] This system...
[2251.69] is like a building.
[2254.57] It has taken years to build this building.
[2257.72] And everyone has a hand in this.
[2263.06] Moving one brick...
[2267.00] won't topple this building.
[2271.88] I think the voice didn't reach you.
[2275.97] Or maybe you didn't hear it.
[2281.49] Listen to it carefully.
[2284.32] This building started to topple over
[2287.31] the day my father refused
to become a part of it.
[2429.38] So?  How's everything going?
[2433.62] Did your wounds heal?
[2436.59] The wound is very deep.
[2439.00] It'll take some time.
[2442.40] ASP Sabiha Shah.
[2443.74] Although a dangerous criminal was killed
due to your actions,
[2447.65] and a breakthrough was made against
corrupt practices in the police department,
[2452.63] but at the same time, police procedure
was violated because of your actions.
[2457.46] And the police department also gained
some bad reputation.
[2460.24] There are some rules of the operation.
[2462.06] There are some rules,
but I didn't care for any of that.
[2466.84] How much more time are you going to take
for your wounds?
[2471.01] At some point,
you'll have to move forward in life.
[2475.81] I'm trying.
[2479.17] Putting one foot ahead of the other.
[2481.81] As a punishment for your misconduct,
for six months,
[2485.03] you're being demoted to an Inspector
from an ASP.
[2488.72] And since it seems that you
need to understand the procedure,
[2492.77] that's why you're being posted
at the Malikabad Police Station.
[2496.91] Go and learn something on the ground...
[2500.87] how to work.
[2503.22] Dismissed.
[2507.09] Sir.
[2510.50] Inspector Sabiha.
[2515.66] Sir.
[2517.70] If you ever need any warrant,
