[9.84] Maybe Shah forgot
if he is a police officer or a criminal.
[15.43] Look at the target and fire.  Fire!
[18.82] Ahsan, listen to something very carefully.
[21.25] Take this as the first
and the last warning.
[27.71] I raised myself!
[30.00] -And, Mom, I raised you too!
- So why are you telling me that?
[34.80] I know what Ahsan did.
[38.03] Sabiha, I was ready to do anything
for Aiza.  Anything!
[45.78] Mama!
[229.12] How can I help you?
[233.03] Are you computing the records?
[237.46] Yes.
[240.20] How far has it reached?
[242.90] I told Sir that day as well.  I am one man.
It takes some time.
[250.52] But still.
[254.54] How far have you come?
[258.00] I've reached 2015. Can I help you?
[262.14] I wanted to ask if a cadet wants access
to some old records...
[268.40] what's the process for it?
[271.04] You guys aren't authorized.
[274.10] For research purposes.
[275.97] If there's an order from the higher ups,
then it's possible.
[278.37] But that doesn't usually happen.
[281.46] what's it to you guys?
[290.23] Not everyone passes away.
[293.28] I was just looking.
[295.51] I told you it's not authorized
for the cadets!
[299.48] You either get clearance
from the higher ups or leave!
[303.48] Or should I tell the Commander?
[310.17] Everyone just comes here!
[319.69] Your Training Academy session
is almost about to end.
[324.38] Every year, there's a specialized training
organized at the end of the year.
[331.10] Top cadets from the entire country
take part in that.
[334.68] You will also be divided into batches
of tens like other cadets.
[338.76] And every cadet
will go through a combined course.
[343.55] Legal, theory, operational...
[348.86] and firearm combat.
[351.88] These cadets are the best of the best.
[355.18] For an entire week, every cadet will be
measured though every test in every way.
[360.41] From there it'll be decided which cadets
will become field officers,
[365.61] who will be "kudday lined",
and who will go back to being civilians.
[371.66] I've taught you people what I could.
[375.50] It's in your hands from here on out.
[377.84] So give it your best.
[380.42] And don't embarrass me.
[449.95] - Aazo?
-Yes?
[453.36] -How was your day today?
-Very good!  We had so much fun.
[460.06] what did you do?
[461.82] We went to a park for a picnic.
[464.50] First we went on to the slides,
then the swings.
[468.02] And Nadia Auntie made such tasty foods;
burgers, sandwiches, pizza.
[473.70] I really missed you.
[478.31] I missed you too, child.
[485.77] Yeah, Aazo.
[488.83] How do you like Nadia Auntie?
[492.25] Yes!  She's so nice and loves me a lot.
And I love her too.
[503.37] And Dad?
[505.79] Is your dad happy?
[507.95] Yes, Dad is happy.  Nadia Auntie's so funny,
we just laugh all the time.
[534.65] I'll be back till Sunday.
[536.91] If you need anything for Aazo from Dubai,
text me.
[699.30] How long has this been going on?
[713.57] As a woman,
I, at least, have the right to ask this.
[723.89] Approximately six months.
[736.72] How'd you meet?
[740.03] At a mutual friend's lunch.
[754.38] And then?
[759.45] We talked and exchanged numbers.
[765.21] And then...
[768.16] And both of you went directly to Paris.
[778.70] Ahsan never told you that he has a wife
and a daughter?
[787.15] I'm so sorry!
[791.72] I'm not the kind of woman you think I am.
[797.90] I couldn't ever even think that I'd be
involved in a situation like this.
[807.24] Okay, tell me.
What kind of woman are you?
[819.01] Do you love him?
[825.87] And does he love you?
[829.61] Yeah.
[852.73] Wow.
[856.97] Everything is connected to each other.
[867.83] The special training course for you cadets
is a weeklong.
[873.62] Classes will be resumed from tomorrow
and so will the physical training.
[879.66] Instructors will mark you at every stage.
[883.57] And at the end of the training,
[886.46] one cadet from you will become
the top position holder.
[891.87] Best of the best.
[894.50] Winner of the prestigious Sword of Honor.
[898.33] I know some of you, but still.
Introduce yourself to each other.
[902.94] -Saleem Afridi, Peshawar Division, Sir!
-Sarfaraz Parvez, Quetta Division, Sir!
[908.04] -Kashif Chaudry, Lahore Division, Sir!
-Sabiha Shah, Lahore Division, Sir!
[912.38] -Aftab Nabi, Karachi Division, Sir!
-Sajid Hussain, Karachi Division, Sir!
[923.35] Maybe it seems glamorous on TV
and in films.
[928.62] But you all have a big responsibility
as a police officer!
[935.48] To maintain peace and quiet.
[938.98] You'll get calls every other day from
various neighborhoods about many fights.
[945.04] Your job is to mediate.
[948.26] And to take actions against those
that provoke the emotions of the people,
[952.72] arrest them and prosecute them.  ok?
[958.73] Question.
[961.20] Getting a group of public to fight another.
[965.14] Gathering of people at a place
with the intention of causing disturbance.
[970.68] Which Article will be implemented
if the FIR is filed?
[974.22] -Section 153-A of Pakistan Penal Court.
- Title?
[978.15] Promoting enmity between different groups.
[980.63] And 153-B?
[983.00] Inducing students to take
part in political activity.
[986.10] Very good.  Another question.
[988.45] A driver injured a cyclist by his car,
but the cyclist didn't die.
[994.36] - When will the FIR be filed for this-- -
Sir?
[996.56] Section 337-G and section 337-H.
[1000.42] Very good, Sabiha.  Very good.
[1004.01] Now let's talk about the concept of qisas,
diyat and arsh.
[1010.74] Page number 245.
[1014.29] Everyone, please.
[1021.30] Madam!
[1025.34] Yes?
[1028.09] Sajid Hussain, Karachi Division.
[1031.62] Sabiha Shah, Lahore Division.
[1035.26] I know.
[1037.44] You give really good answers.
[1040.54] Very impressive.
It seems as if you've prepared a lot!
[1044.62] Thank you!
[1048.14] I wanted to say
that please give us a chance too!
[1052.33] We should also be able to answer
1 or 2 questions.
[1055.08] There'll be a marking for this,
so we'll get some numbers.
[1058.48] If you knew the answers,
then why didn't you speak up?
[1061.25] Oh, you didn't give me a chance.
I was standing there with my hands raised.
[1065.01] So next time, Mr.  Sajid, give answers
along with raising your hands.
[1070.66] Look, Ms.  Sabiha, I don't know how it works
in Lahore, but...
[1075.85] the people of Karachi keep
everyone together.
[1079.25] Like friends.
[1081.44] Mr.  Sajid, let me make one thing clear.
[1084.19] I'm not here to make friends.
I am here to become a police officer.
[1088.39] And, at the end of the day,
this is a competition.
[1092.40] All right then.
[1094.74] If this is a competition,
then I'll meet you on the field.
[1101.08] We'll see what happens there.
[1103.98] I'll win and show you.  It
[1106.83] doesn't matter what.
[1110.86] Good luck.
[1122.43] - False evidence?
-Section 191 of Pakistan Penal Code, Sir.
[1127.55] And also 209 if the evidence is presented
at the court.
[1133.59] Very good.
[1135.34] If you've given refuge to a criminal?
[1138.06] - 21--
- 212, Sir.  212.
[1142.38] Good.
[1152.82] Fire, Sabiha!
[1157.44] Fire!
[1159.76] Fire the gun, madam.  The culprits
have crossed Sheikhupura toll.
[1164.79] Quiet!
[1171.17] Sabiha, fire!
[1174.41] And fire.
[1179.77] I rarely ever saw the use of section 271
in my career.
[1184.15] But it was used during the pandemic
to enforce the quarantine.
[1190.75] What I want to say is thorough knowledge
of the law is very important
[1195.60] for the exercise of law enforcement.
[1199.70] Sir?
[1202.01] Yes?
[1202.87] Sir, you mentioned so
many laws for the public,
[1205.81] so, Sir, is any law implemented against
the police too?
[1209.41] Of course.
[1210.56] I mean, Sir, there must be a punishment
there if a policeman broke the law, right?
[1215.09] Sir, I've also heard that some policemen
became criminals themselves while working.
[1221.98] Right, Brothers?  Such cases have happened,
right?
[1224.17] - Absolutely.
-Sure.
[1224.91] I mean, if the people who
protect the law started breaking it,
[1227.45] then they should get
some punishment too, no?
[1229.34] - Absolutely!
- Absolutely!
[1230.18] So speak up!  That's what I'm saying.
[1233.41] Police officers are not above the law.
[1236.96] We have a very robust system of
internal affairs present in our department.
[1242.65] If a police officer breaks a law,
[1245.11] then the same law will be enforced
on them as a common civilian.
[1255.96] what was this?
[1259.98] what do you mean what was it?
[1262.13] You know exactly what I am talking about.
[1265.01] Did something happen in the classroom?
[1268.90] how dare you?
[1271.31] what did you find out?
[1273.62] Not just me, Madam.  Everyone knows.
[1276.33] But nobody says anything
because they're scared of you.  -They're
[1279.89] scared.
-Your uncle's there, DIG Sir.
[1285.14] You don't know anything!
[1287.43] They all lie!  Spew nonsense!
[1289.59] My father was a good man
and an even better officer.
[1294.24] Whether I know something or not,
[1296.39] but I do know how this system is made to
facilitate people like you.
[1301.25] I've passed the CSS exams!
[1303.15] And I've as much right to be here
as you do!
[1306.48] It's better if you don't talk about rights.
[1310.37] Your father's record was locked in a file,
and he was given an awards and buried.
[1316.31] Do you even know what my father used to do?
[1319.44] He was a fruit seller.
He used to sell fruits to people like you.
[1323.65] He scarified everything to get me here.
[1327.80] For you, it all must be an
interesting thing to do, Madam.
[1330.84] Or maybe a family tradition.
But, for me, it's a war.
[1335.06] Against this system.
[1337.78] Everything's fair in love and war.
[1340.69] You know nothing about the fire
I've been through to get here.
[1344.86] And I don't need any help to get
where I want to be.
[1348.89] And no one can come in my way either!
[1353.11] We'll know it soon.
[1355.68] But I will say one thing.
[1358.50] If you win, I'll come to salute you myself.
[1364.01] Because people like us...
[1366.89] we know how to win
and how to lose.
[1462.88] You won't be able to do it
even if you practice like for a 100 years.
[1470.77] It won't happen until you smash the statue
of your fear.
[1488.25] Life is a difficult journey
for people like you, Sabiha.
[1497.45] The fire that gives you strength,
it also burns you to ashes.
[1505.76] You're exactly like your father.
[1510.79] Si... Sir, did you know him?
[1515.89] I worked with him, and...
[1520.87] he was my first boss.
[1525.84] And he was a good officer.
[1532.10] There were a lot of people amongst us that
weren't satisfied with the inquiry report.
[1535.74] They could have done more.
[1537.78] There were witnesses
that we could've spoken to,
[1539.64] but the situation in the
country was such that...
[1544.26] File closed, case solved.
[1548.56] Sir, why didn't you do anything
for so many years?
[1554.04] It doesn't work like that.
[1559.50] Time goes on and the world forgets.
[1567.22] But you didn't forget.
[1576.16] Sabiha, there are a lot of people
in the department
[1578.04] who have high expectations of you.
[1582.28] The biggest stepping stone of your way
is your own fear.
[1588.52] If you want to get to the truth...
[1592.05] then learn to win against yourself.
[1643.79] Cadets, it's a reminder call.
15 minutes remaining.
[1677.09] Excuse me!
[1678.94] Sir.
[1680.27] - Sir.
- Oh, you're done too?
[1755.27] He'll always remain a martyr
in front of the public.
[1759.42] The file has been closed. 
[1763.54] Maybe... everything...
[1768.48] will be buried inside a cupboard forever.
[1774.54] Child, remembers one thing.
[1777.20] Whenever you fight, fight for a purpose.
[1781.74] And when you find that purpose,
fight without fear.
[1787.51] And if you have to fight...
[1790.49] always fight to win.
[1890.41] Sir!  Madam-- I mean, Madam Sir!
[1910.03] What are you doing sitting here all day,
Qurban Ali?
[1916.80] I'm in search of a file.
