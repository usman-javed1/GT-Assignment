[7.23] For you, it all must be an
interesting thing to do, Madam.
[10.23] Or maybe a family tradition.
But, for me, it's a war.
[14.55] You know nothing about the fire 
I've been through to get here.
[20.90] My daughter can't live without me!
[23.13] Forget her, you can't even take
care of yourself! You're an addict!
[26.67] You need help.
[30.54] If you want to get to the truth...
[34.00] then learn to win against yourself.
[49.20] whenever you fight, fight for a purpose.
[53.79] And when you find that purpose,
fight without fear.
[59.71] And if you have to fight...
[62.62] always fight to win.
[96.47] Evidence.
[112.43] I want a divorce.
[115.19] And my daughter will go with me.
You can meet her on the weekends.
[121.57] If you accept it then fine.
[123.06]  Otherwise, the entire world will see
this evidence tomorrow.
[184.33] Sir! Madam-- I mean, Madam Sir!
[203.58] What do you do all day sitting here, 
Qurban Ali?
[207.32] Madam, I'm an electrical engineer.
[210.43] They enrolled me into police
for technological advancements,
[214.74] but they've put me on files.
[217.95] I make these devices in my free time,
but no one has ever taken an interest.
[240.81] What is this?
[242.65] Extended range acoustic monitoring system
with GSM integration.
[247.35] Huh?
[249.57] Basically, it's a bugging device.
[252.14] If put in a room, it can caption the
range of voice till about 10 meters.
[259.36] Where do you put it?
[262.02] It can be stuck under any table
and no one pays any attention either.
[266.46] Does it even work?
[273.82] Speak freely, Qurban Ali. 
There's no need to be scared.
[278.10] It's just between us.
[285.90] I swear to God we don't take it
because we like to.
[288.28] But we have to feed our wives 
and children too.
[290.88] And besides, family members taunt me
that I'm an ASI yet I still have a scooter.
[297.40] Man...
[298.61] Sir, when a person comes to
the police station, we help him too!
[302.10] If someone gives us 1000 or 2000
as a gift,
[305.32] so is it nice to say no?
I don't even feel like saying no.
[318.23] I'm looking for a file, Qurban Ali.
[321.80] The file is from which date, Madam?
[324.60] 2007 to 2008.
[327.39] What's the name of the file?
[330.26] Inspector Saeed Shah.
[333.31] It was an internal inquiry.
[337.78] Such an old file, Madam. 
And who is this Inspector Shah?
[427.29] How are you, Madam SP?
[430.17] Perfectly fine. You tell me.
[433.90] I'm perfectly fine 
and I'm going back to Karachi.
[437.81] So I thought I'd meet you. 
I owe you a salute.
[442.26] No, no. There's no need for that.
[445.87] There is a need.
[448.30] I couldn't understand you correctly.
[451.91] And maybe I didn't understand you.
[457.17] The thing is; I don't have any faith 
in the system.
[460.88] Because of that I've gotten used to seeing
everyone with a skeptical eye.
[465.27] But meeting you and losing to you
felt really nice.
[472.75] So tell me; what are your plans ahead?
[476.48] Did you get your posting finalized?
[478.89] Yes, I've gotten my first posting - 
Karachi East.
[483.08] Let's see what I can do.
[486.31] It's a very tough posting.
[488.61] No, no.
[490.29] I've spent a lot of time in those streets.
[492.81] I know it thoroughly.
[494.91] I'll use that as an advantage on the field.
[499.48] Although you're smarter than I am, 
Mr. Sajid, but...
[504.90] be careful.
[507.36] Work carefully.
[509.68] Always one step in front of another.
[513.46] And yes, if you need anything here 
in Lahore,
[517.12] then call me directly.
[519.90] Non matter how the system is,
[521.32] you'll always a find a good partner
and a good friend here.
[539.36] He beats me up every other day!
[541.98] He hits me over small, small things.
[545.01] No matter how big or small the issue is,
he can't control his hands, Madam.
[549.72] She's spewing nonsense, Madam!
She's lying!
[552.70] She's brought all the matters of the home
to the police station.
[555.55] - She just wants to irritate me!
- I'm the one who's lying?
[560.10] Day before yesterday, he came at 3 in the
morning and asked me cook him a hot roti!
[564.77] I told him to reheat it 
since I already cooked it.
[568.24] He hit me so much, Madam! Look at this,
I've bruises all over my hands.
[573.68] I came home at 3 after working all day!
[577.24] I only asked for a hot roti so
she said "heat it up yourself"!
[580.66] Quiet!
[583.32] - Arif?
- Yes, Madam?
[584.83] Come here!
[586.90] Take him to the lock up.
[589.33] Take him to the lock up 
and take out his anger.
[592.11] - His blood is very warm!
- Yes, Madam.
[594.72] - Oh, please forgive me! Please forgive.
- Madam!
[597.85] - Oh! Sir, please forgive me.
- Madam, Madam, Madam!
[600.46] - Madam, Madam!
- I won't do it again!
[602.03] - Madam, Madam!
- I won't do it again!
[603.80] Give us one chance, Madam. 
He said he won't do it again.
[608.61] Yes.
[610.37] That's it? That's what your masculinity was?
[613.78] You're a tiger when you hit her!
[617.05] What happened now?
[619.22] Your legs started shivering?
[621.08] Madam! For God's and the Prophet's sake,
please forgive me! I won't do it again!
[624.86] Oh! Don't bring God and the Prophet 
into this!
[628.17] You've done this yourself 
and you're bringing in God!
[631.51] And you! Wives like you, 
[635.04] you tolerate the beatings 
and others have to too.
[639.28] Arif!
[641.10] Leave them!
[642.52] And do one thing; note down their address.
Keep on checking them on your way.
[647.24] And if it ever happens again, 
bring him in again.
[650.48] We'll take out his heat once again.
[653.52] Get lost!
[655.50] Get up!
[656.80] - Thank you very much, Madam.
- Get lost from here!
[658.35] Thank you very much.
[659.07] - Thank you very much, Madam.
- Come on. Let's go!
[661.48] Thank you very much, Madam.
Come on, come on. Hurry up. Come.
[664.98] Hurry up, come on.
[706.53] - Salam! You were very late today.
- Salam!
[712.32] This is how it's going to be now.
[715.10] Aiza was really sick today.
[719.36] What happened?
[720.89] She said she had a stomach ache,
maybe she ate something at school.
[724.11] - Then?
- I gave her kichdi, she's asleep now.
[728.61] - Okay, I'll see her.
- Won't you eat something?
[731.59] No.
[734.56] - In fact, do one thing. Get me coffee.
- All right, I'll get it.
[804.71] Madam, records are saved 
according to the dates.
[807.36] I searched all the boxes from 2007 to 2008.
But I couldn't find your file.
[813.42] Then I took out each and every file
and read through it.
[816.57] So I found this file.
[819.20] There's no name on this file,
no is there a cover page on this.
[870.15] We all thought he was Shah.
[874.18] But he transformed into Shakir.
[880.25] As much as we investigated...
[885.05] we kept finding his crimes.
[890.51] But his funeral?
[896.11] All of you buried him, right?
[899.94] This was the department's decision.
[904.99] Entire police force's name would've been
tarnished had it come out to the public.
[911.32] After all...
[914.32] he was our brother.
[918.01] This is why Mr. IG and all of us decided 
that...
[923.80] all of us will remember his service,
not his crime.
[933.26] That day, not Shakir...
[939.87] but Inspector Shah was honored.
[945.44] We buried our brother.
[949.80] But, Uncle, 
why didn't you ever say something?
[954.39] Why did you let us all live on a lie?
[959.49] I promised him.
[963.78] That I'll take care of all of you.
[968.55] I'll protect you.
[974.38] I couldn't break my promise.
[977.77] For that...
[982.89] what's a little lie?
[986.11] I could've sacrificed my life for it.
[999.77] And Rehman?
[1003.08] He ran off to Dubai.
[1006.85] Then Kenya from there.
[1010.04] And then he vanished.
[1014.12] Some people say he was killed there
in a fight with local gangsters.
[1027.18] Sabiha, child...
[1030.33] we did whatever we could've.
[1035.47] Your career is just starting now.
[1039.80] I'm not your father, but...
[1043.04] but I'm advising you because I think of you
as my daughter.
[1047.68] Don't dig old graves.
[1050.58] The black spot that's on you
and your family...
[1056.73] you can wash it away with your good
and honest service.
[1066.52] Some truths...
[1070.22] are better off buried.
[1092.55] Hello?
[1097.40] I'm on duty. 
What do you want to talk about?
[1106.88] What happened to Aazo?
[1111.62] Which hospital?
[1114.69] Okay.
[1139.31] You've finally come? I was calling you 
since so long!
[1143.01] Me and the school.
[1145.58] Aazo is fighting for her life here
and you can't make time with your job?
[1150.82] Is that why you brought my daughter 
with you?
[1153.80] Ahsan, don't start everywhere at all times.
[1158.48] Besides, it's not like you've done me
any favors by looking after your daughter.
[1163.04] She's your daughter!
[1165.13] Sabiha, favor and responsibility 
are two very separate things.
[1172.18] You know what's making the difference?
[1174.70] The time that you want to spend with
your wife, it has actually affected that.
[1180.33] You're an extremely selfish man.
[1182.77] You're against Nadia for no reason.
[1185.40] She's coming here to spend time with Aazo
leaving everything behind.
[1189.86] She's going to come here? 
To spend time with Aazo?
[1194.40] Somebody has to stay here with her.
[1197.34] Ahsan, I want to tell you something
very calmly.
[1202.13] You made her your wife, I don't care.
[1205.61] But if you tried to make that woman
the mother of my kid...
[1210.47] So what? Now you're going 
to wear that uniform and threaten me?
[1218.97] Take it as a threat.
[1327.05] There's no need for that, Sir.
[1329.92] Rules are rules, Madam. 
Maybe... I taught you that.
[1344.32] Qurban told me 
that you went through the records.
[1349.16] Did you find that file?
[1353.01] Yes.
[1355.12] I found it and saw everything.
[1358.83] The man I thought of as a hero 
my entire life...
[1363.42] I saw his reality too.
[1367.47] What you saw, you believed it all as it is?
[1373.77] There's a whole inquiry report.
[1377.14] All the details are in there.
[1390.48] Madam, you have a lot of trust
on the system.
[1402.18] I told you what it's written in the report
is not the whole truth.
[1407.93] Then what is the whole truth?
[1412.61] And if you know the whole truth,
then why didn't you tell me?
[1417.59] Because I don't know 
what the truth is either.
[1421.32] But there is one person 
who knows the entire story.
[1430.65] - Who?
- Rehman Lala.
[1437.77] Rehman Lala is dead.
[1441.58] Madam, do you know 
what's the devil's biggest strength?
[1446.09] Lies.
[1448.54] Cheating.
[1451.05] Fraud.
[1454.36] These strong people can easily hide anyone
when they want to shelter them.
[1463.55] Rehman Lala is alive?
[1467.30] This is not my war, Madam.
[1469.93] I...
[1473.30] can't fight this system. This is your war.
[1477.46] If you want to fight this system,
you can try.
[1492.64] There's a doctor near old Anarkali,
Wasson market.
[1498.01] All criminals of the city go to meet him.
[1501.39] A cripple man comes there for treatment.
[1504.59] His name is Ashraf. You should meet him.
[1508.78] Maybe you'll find out the truth
you've been looking for your whole life.
[1589.25] Yes, man. How much is it for?
[1591.25] - How much?
- 40 rupees.
[1592.67] 40 rupees, all right. And this?
[1595.86] All right.
[1598.06] All right.
[1614.98] - Yes, Arif?
- Madam, I found Ashraf.
[1619.22] - Where is he?
- Madam, he just left from the doctor's.
[1622.51] He's buying vegetables.
I'm right behind him.
[1626.21] He shouldn't get away, Arif.
[1637.79] Don't worry, Madam. He won't go anywhere.
[1660.83] Madam, he's gotten into a rickshaw.
[1663.28] - Arif, go after him.
- Madam, I don't have the money.
[1668.58] Shame on you! You're a policeman.
[1726.40] Madam, he's going into the street.
The street is closed off ahead.
[1729.93] I think his house is around here somewhere.
[1741.28] Yes, Madam, I found Ashraf's house.
Should I send you the location?
[1751.71] Yes, send it. I'm coming.
[1775.62] Hello?
[1777.81] I need your help.
[1810.83] Thank you for coming.
[1837.46] Madam, this is Ashraf's house.
[1844.19] - Did someone come here?
- No, Madam. No one came here.
[1847.99] All right. You can go now.
[1851.37] Madam, should I come with you?
In case there's a problem.
[1855.46] I'll handle it.
[1858.05] Go.
[1879.43] Coming.
[1895.41] Yes?
[1899.31] Can I meet Ashraf?
[1902.57] Who are you? What do you want?
[1906.78] ASP Sabiha Shah.
[1913.83] I'm Shakir's daughter.
