[101.88] Yesterday, I saw Aiza playing
with her parrot, Mithoo.
[108.44] She feeds him.
[112.12] She loves him a lot, she talks to him
as if he understands everything.
[119.47] She is very attached to her parrot.
[122.80] Whenever we go sit in the lawn,
she brings him with her.
[128.37] And then...
[130.55] sometimes she cleans her cage
and leaves the door open.
[137.74] And you know...
[141.47] Mithoo doesn't fly.
[147.31] But if you look at it, Mithoo is caged
forever in that bird cage.
[154.29] He has a clear sky ahead of him,
freedom too, but...
[158.90] he doesn't fly.
[162.05] Maybe...
[163.95] he is scared of freedom.
[168.11] Or maybe...
[169.83] the birds that are caged...
[173.23] they forget how to fly.
[191.25] The little girl struggled.
There are bruises on her body.
[195.48] Cause of death...
[198.39] asphyxiation.
[201.04] The little girl was killed
by being strangled.
[207.87] Who will the police investigation
start from?
[212.09] Who is your suspect and why?
[218.85] Sabiha?
[221.92] Who is your suspect?
[225.05] All of them.
[228.83] Who all?
[230.76] The sweeper, the shop keeper,
[234.63] the van driver...
[237.35] the whole neighborhood
and the school teachers.
[242.07] And the parents.
[247.85] And all the other relatives
that live in the house.
[252.32] The parents.
[254.42] Why the parents?
[257.29] Lie.
[259.65] Everyone lies.
[263.86] Correct!
[266.48] The number one rule of investigation is
that everyone lies.
[271.07] Some for themselves, some for others.
[274.17] The job of the police
is to discover the truth
[276.19] and there is one way
to discover the truth.
[278.96] To find the lies.
[284.87] Light and dark...
[289.52] virtue and mischief...
[292.52] truth and lie...
[296.90] life and death.
[302.13] All of these things are defined
through their opposites.  Not on their own.
[309.63] Remember;  Everyone is a suspect.
[335.21] Do you see the time?
[337.28] She is asleep.
[365.39] Why was your phone off?  Do
[367.50] you know how worried I was?
[369.29] I told you we were going to the water park.
[371.56] She was with her father.
What's there to worry about?
[374.33] What do you mean
"what's there to worry about"?
[376.39] You said you'll bring her back home
at 6 o'clock in the evening.
[379.13] Did you see the time?
It's 10 o'clock at night!
[382.05] She was being stubborn,
she was on the water slides.
[384.54] She was enjoying herself.  I let her enjoy!
What happened?
[387.58] Ahsan, listen to something carefully.
[390.09] You'll bring my daughter back home
at the time we decide.
[394.16] Even if you're late by 10 minutes,
you'll call and let me know.
[399.33] Take it as a first and final warning.
[420.93] Khadija, we really like your daughter.
[426.24] We can finalize things if these two agree.
[431.80] Yes.
[435.48] Ahsan, talk to her.
[440.01] Mother...
[441.62] Sabiha, talk to each other.
[446.25] Mother, are you here?  Right in front of everyone?
[450.35] what's wrong with you?
[452.15] Oh, it's all family here.
[456.71] Sabhi, child...
[458.87] go on, show Ahsan around the grounds.
[464.26] Sister-in-law has decorated the gardens
really well.
[467.84] Go, child.
[472.26] Sorry about that.
Mom is a little old fashioned.  It
[477.13] doesn't matter.
[479.54] It became really awkward, right?
[482.85] I will tell you something about myself.
[484.67] Then you can tell me something
about yourself.
[489.14] I am an only child.
I used to play cricket in school.
[493.00] I wanted to play professionally.
[496.08] Then I realized my passion
was more than my talent.
[500.54] I went to the US for college.
[503.11] Then I worked at a bank there
for some time.
[507.08] We're in the textile industry
and you're no interested in these things.
[513.27] No, no, it's not like that.
[516.52] Look, the thing is, all of this was written
in your CV.
[521.14] Your favorite color, hobbies...
something else.
[528.05] Man, I didn't make the CV myself.
I find it very stupid.
[532.56] But at instances like these,
people always put their best foot forward.
[539.74] But can I tell you something?
[542.26] Today I saw my parents talking
after months.
[546.61] We live in the same house...
[549.01] but not like a family.
[552.46] They never had the guts to separate
in fear of the society.
[558.54] We look like a normal family.
[562.38] But only for show.
[567.69] No family is perfect.
[571.63] I read it somewhere.
[575.92] And the families that are happy,
they're all...
[579.87] they're almost happy in a similar way.
[583.51] Cars, houses...
[586.15] comfort, birthdays.
[589.84] Whereas, the families that are unhappy,
they...
[594.11] they're all unhappy
in their own unique ways.  Tolstoy.
[601.35] - Have you read him?
-A little bit.
[606.35] By the way, Ahsan, the scope for happiness
is really narrow, no?
[612.21] And sadness is just that much bigger.
[616.97] Joy and sadness are parallel to each other.
[619.97] That's what life is.  But I have a hope.
[624.97] That when I have my own family,
[627.63] I won't repeat the same mistakes
my parents did.
[631.13] And the traumas I've been through...
[633.86] I want to my child as far away from them
as possible.
[637.60] And try to build a life
that's full of happiness,
[642.74] no matter how narrow the scope
for happiness is.
[676.90] Regardless of how it ended...
[679.39] you must've spent
some good times together too?
[683.13] Of course.
[685.24] All relationships are good
at the beginning.
[690.01] Ours was too.
[756.40] I love you.
[795.65] I hate you!
[848.92] Sabiha?
[851.58] Sabiha!
[870.16] Sabiha!
[872.65] Your daughter is waiting for you
at breakfast.
[876.82] Have some fear of God, man!
[913.56] Adan wanted to be the prince but the
teacher said he didn't know the lines.
[918.18] So she didn't give him any role.
He was super upset.
[922.43] So I told the teacher to give him
some role at least.
[925.79] Then you know what role
the teacher gave him?
[929.27] The one which had no lines.  Do
you know what did he get?
[934.88] What?
[936.72] A tree!  He's a tree.
[939.69] He was very upset so I told him
being a tree is fun.
[944.99] Because you get to stand tall and strong
like a real one.
[951.89] All right, Aazo, child.
[954.54] Time to go.  The car is ready.
[957.12] - Papa, 2 minutes.
-Child.
[961.43] We're getting late.
[964.43] Come on, time to go, child.
[968.81] Fine.
[974.63] Take care.  Have a nice day!
[980.53] -Goodbye!
-Goodbye!
[990.94] Okay, listen.
[993.25] I'll go to abroad for a few meetings
for a few days.
[998.97] Don't miss Aiza's play.
She was very excited about it.
[1004.11] When will you come back, Ahsan?
[1006.94] Why?  will you miss me?
[1014.32] Ahsan, what do you think about it?
[1018.71] Thought about what?
[1020.91] About CSS.
[1024.38] I was thinking to appear
for exams this time.
[1029.89] I have the time too now.
Aiza has also started going to school.
[1036.06] Do you think you're in a condition
to appear for CSS exams?
[1040.86] Ahsan, that's what we spoke about before,
right?
[1046.76] You always say no.
[1049.71] Every year.
[1051.99] First I missed it because of the kid.
Then I missed it in order to raise her.
[1058.08] Now I'm at home all the time
and I have nothing to do.
[1063.00] I can do it.
[1066.96] You're in a mess right now.  Have
[1070.22] you started the pills again?
[1073.14] Right now, I'd suggest that you focus
on Aiza.
[1077.78] And more importantly, focus on yourself.
[1082.37] I'll be back on Sunday.
[1086.13] Remember...
[1088.46] don't miss Aiza's play.
[1127.12] You're late.
[1133.04] Mom?
[1138.93] I've to talk to you about something.
[1143.04] Talk.
[1147.61] Nothing is okay at the house.
[1151.82] The situation...
[1155.26] what happened?
[1159.62] Nothing is all right...
[1162.28] between Ahsan and I.
[1166.55] There's a lot of distance.
[1170.21] We don't even talk anymore.
[1174.52] So?
[1179.14] So, Mom, what do I do?
[1183.73] what's there to do?
[1186.76] It's a marriage.
[1189.18] That's how marriages are.
[1196.50] Mom, we'll have to do something.
[1203.03] My life has become a death sentence.
[1210.27] So what do you want?
[1212.89] Passion?  Love?
[1217.23] These bookish things have nothing to do
with life at all.
[1223.62] Let it go on how it's going on.
[1227.51] This is life.
[1229.51] It goes on.
[1234.05] Why are you like this, Mom?
[1240.37] Whatever happened to you,
it happened to all of us too.
[1245.33] If you were widowed,
then we were orphaned too.
[1251.49] If you worked hard,
tried to be there for us...
[1257.90] everything could've been fine.
[1263.15] But, Mom, you...
[1265.39] left us alone despite being alive.
[1271.52] I raised you guys.
[1274.33] Wrong.
[1276.96] I've raised myself.
[1280.30] I've raised Sameer.
[1283.55] And, Mom, I've raised you too.
[1285.44] So why are you acting as
if you've done a favor?
[1288.44] Did I ask you to become everyone's mother?
[1293.52] Someone had to be.
[1297.56] You couldn't do it.
[1303.41] Tell me something truthfully.
[1307.42] did you ever love me?
[1315.09] No.
[1319.27] I couldn't love you.  Do
[1325.27] you know why?
[1330.66] I always saw your father in you.
[1335.02] I still do.
[1338.98] The man who ruined my life.
[1343.60] She didn't leave me in a
state to show anyone my face.
[1348.94] When I hate him so much...
[1354.02] then how could I love you?
[1361.20] It's not your fault.
[1365.79] But there are some...
[1369.00] things that humans have no control over.
[1484.83] Did Aiza go to school?
[1493.36] I got late in getting home last night.
[1498.18] Really?
[1504.30] is this tea?  Safdar!
Please bring fresh tea.
[1511.82] Then?
[1514.91] How were your meetings?
[1518.84] The usual.  They were fine.
[1523.77] And where were these meetings?
[1529.03] Today...
[1531.24] you're taking a lot of interest in my life.
[1537.29] They were in Karachi.
[1539.65] Some cafe is being opened.
There are talks about its investment.
[1543.29] It's a creative space
for writers/thinkers types.
[1547.70] It's an interesting concept.
[1550.87] Tell me...
[1552.39] how was Aiza's place?
[1555.03] I really wanted to be there.
[1558.92] Interesting.
[1564.14] And?
[1566.54] Did it hurt?
[1569.89] Of course.
[1571.95] It hurts.
[1577.79] But why all of this happened,
I... understand.
[1613.27] I feel to know
that in all of this situation, you...
[1618.32] you think yourself to be
equally responsible.
[1624.20] But nothing justifies cheating.
[1630.65] I know what Ahsan did.
[1635.77] But I'm also aware of what I did.
[1651.52] I read somewhere that...
[1654.30] the families that are happy, they all...
[1657.67] are happy in the same way.
[1662.09] Cars, house, servants, comfort.
[1667.90] Whereas the families that are unhappy,
they are all...
[1672.31] unhappy in a different and unique way.
[1682.47] The scope for happiness
is so narrow, right?
[1687.47] And sadness is so vast.
