Sister-in-law, I'm very sorry.
Shah was a good officer. And I have full faith that he was also
a good husband and a good father. We're with you through your pain. Thank you, Sir. Akbar... where are the arrangements for the
pension papers, martyr funds and benefits? No, Sir, everything's in the process
on urgent basis. Good. Now all you can do is be patient.
Whatever God willed. Sir, there was something I wanted
to talk to you about. Yes, yes, tell me. Sir, thank you for everything
you've done for me. But, Sir, right now we... we don't need sympathizers. We need justice. Me for my husband
and my daughter for her father. Akbar, what are the updates
in the investigation? Sir, Rehman is missing. Our informants told us that he has run off
to Dubai. And there's no proof anyway, Sir, that whether he committed
this murder himself... or he had it done from someone else. It means it could be someone else too. Sir, the conditions Shah was working under,
there was a lot of danger there. He told me that some things
are coming through Afghanistan that these people were targeting. You mean there could be some
foreign involvement too? Yes, Sir, that's absolutely a possibility. Look, Sister-in-law... Akbar is overseeing
this investigation himself. I'll contact you as soon
as we get some update. All right? Sir... please put more people on this. And if you know Rehman has run off to
Dubai, then why don't you guys catch him? Look, it's not such an easy task. And that, too, in these conditions. There are blasts happening every day. 36 of my officers and soldiers
were martyred last year. How many people am I gonna investigate for? You can at least get justice
for the officer that... you yourself sent to die! Whose wife was made into a widow and
children into orphans by your decisions. - Sister-in-law...
- What? Look, this was an undercover mission.
He was willing to do it. He insisted on heading it.
Despite us refusing it multiple times. He didn't step out of it. Ask Akbar. He asked him to back off too. Look, I didn't want to discuss it with you. But the investigation is pointing out
that maybe Shah forgot... whether he's a police officer
or a criminal. Sir, please. I apologize. Look, this is an internal matter. You have no concern with this. You... are calling my martyr husband... a criminal? And I have no concern with that? If I knew his own people are
going to treat him this way, then I never would've come to you
looking for justice. Get up! Look, the truth is going to come
out one day. I promise you this. Sir! How can this happen now, Brother Akbar? No one knew Shah better than you. Tell me, Sister-in-law... he lived two lives for a lot of years... it's possible that the line
between the two... blurred. It has happened with other officers too. Then why didn't he talk to me? Why didn't he talk to you?
You could've helped him. He might've not wanted to involve you. He might've wanted to protect you
and the family. I can't discuss the things
we're uncovering in the investigation. Maybe... we... weren't able to understand Shah properly. Lie! He couldn't have done it! My husband is not a criminal! He's a martyr! He's a martyr! He'll always remain a martyr to the public. This is an internal police matter. The file has been closed. Maybe... everything... will be buried in some cupboard forever. Let's talk about your father. My dad? He was a good man. Sir! You couldn't learn
how to salute in three years! I'll try again, Sir! Let it be. What are you doing? Sir, the office's CCTV stop working.
I'm fixing that. There's an issue in the volt meter, Sir.
It's not getting the full 18 volts. So the cameras are glitching. Did we employ you here to computerize
the records or to be an electrician? Don't try to be Einstein
and do your work. The office people give me these things.
I'm an engineer, as you know. How far are you through with the records? Sir, I'm only one person here.
I have to scan each page separately, Sir. How far? I'm through till 2015. The police department has decided
to computerize their entire record. Up until a few years ago, all the officers used to submit
their files in a handwritten form. Now everything will be computerized. Mamma? - Aazo? You didn't sleep yet, child?
- Mama, it... What happened? It's my result card. The teacher has told us to get it signed. The teacher has called you to
the school tomorrow for a meeting. Aiza, what are these results, child? Did you not study? Mamma, sorry. Okay, child, please. Don't cry! Doesn't matter.
We'll work hard the next time. All right? Come here, come to me. Come here, sit. Doesnâ€™t matter, child. Don't cry. Amazing, Brother Akbar.
You're not eating anything. No, Sister-in-law, it was amazing! You request me a lot of times
to make Biryani. - Take a little bit.
- Let it be. I anyway don't fit in the uniform anymore. Okay, serve a little. I'll start dieting form next week then. Today is a cheat day. And you! Keep your phone down
for two minutes at least. Eat your dinner. Yes? Are you still upset? Who's upset? What happened? You should ask her this question. Yes, Sabiha, what happened? Uncle, why don't you take me seriously? I told you to keep personal
and professional life separate. Oh, what did I say?
I just asked about your wellbeing. Then don't ask about my wellbeing. I'm just a cadet at the office. What's the big deal?
He only asked about your wellbeing. Why are you getting so serious? Mom, it is something to get serious about. I won't get any special treatment
at the office. We decided that, yes? Then why am I getting it? Tell me something. Do you call anyone else
from my team and ask how they're doing? Uncle, please. Don't single me out. I think you're being unfair. I wasn't singling you out. But it's my right to keep an eye out
on your wellbeing, right? It is, right? Uncle, do you know what's being unfair is?
It's what you do. You ask Commander Sir
for my reports every day. What will my team think of me
if they found out? Uncle, I want to do everything
based on merit. Okay, sorry. Maybe you're right. There's no need for you to apologize
to her. She's hot headed just like her father. No, Sister-in-law, the fault is mine. Actually I forgot that Sabiha
is not the little girl that I raised. The thing is we forget. And we think the kids are always
going to remain kids but they grow up. I think maybe you don't
remember something else either. Sabiha is not your daughter and
I'm not your son. We're not your kids! - Shut up, Sameer!
- Sameer! What? I'm telling the truth.
I think he's confused. You're not our father. Shameless! Your father is dead! This man has raised you! You're going to respect him.
Do you understand? No, Sister-in-law. Let it be, please. Child, your father... was my friend. Just like a brother. You're not my son, but... you're more dear to me
than my own children. Your brother, you friend, if he saw
you here, then what he would've thought? You're sitting on his chair
and having dinner with his family. You're raising his kids when he's not here. You're making decisions for his family
with his wife. What are you doing? Playing the father? - The husband?
- Sameer, shut up! After Reaching Islamabad, both brothers were arrested And he was sent back to Jeddah
after a six hours. On the other hand, PPP leader Benazir Bhutto said
she'll participate in the elections again.  And my solution is let's restore democracy. Let's mobilize the strength of the people,
let's go to the masses. Let's strengthen the people. Okay, your school's here. - Should I come with you and drop you off?
- No, I'll go. Sabiha, If you're not ready yet,
then we can go back home. There's no need to go.
Take a little bit more time. I spoke to your teacher.
She knows what happened. Uncle, we'll start have to
restart our lives sooner or later. I can't just sit at home and cry. - Listen to me.
- Yes? If some kid at the school says something... then you're not going to react at all. I know you're angry. But... you won't fight at all. And you have my number. You can call me whenever you want.
All right? Go on, good. Mom? Mom! Mom! Sameer is crying. Mom! Sameer is crying.
Look at him at least. Who's crying? Sameer! What if something happened?
Look at him at least. Check why is he crying. He must be hungry. The kid was telling me that
she doesn't talk all day long. You don't eat food and you
don't look after the baby at all. Sabiha is scared all night long. And on of it all, she has to look
after the baby as well. Physically, she's perfectly fine. Psychologically, however, she doesn't
seem fine. There's some outstanding issue. Actually... the last few months were very tough on her. It could be an effect of that and most women
get depressed after giving birth anyway. Anyway... I'm prescribing some medicines
that'll relax her, help her sleep. It'll lessen the depression too. There'll
be drowsiness but she'll be fine otherwise. And do take her out once a week. Mom, have breakfast! Mom! Mom, have breakfast. Mom! Mom, what has happened to you? Mom! Mom! Thank you very much. Have a great weekend. Sabiha. Yes, Sir? Please stay for a bit. You won't go home Friday after class. We'll meet at the shooting range.
It's your one-on-one training. Sir, one-on-one? You, alone and the gun range. This fear that you have regarding shooting. We'll have to fix it, all right? Sir, did you receive any instructions
from high above? I'm your teacher. It's my duty to train her. You'll never pass out
if you're scared of firing. And I don't need any orders from above
to train my students. Understand? Yes, Sir. Friday. Be ready. Tell me. What do you want to say? I went to Aazo's school too. Her teacher is also very concerned
about her. Aazo never got such grades, man. Yes. Her teacher also said
that she's very withdrawn. She doesn't talk a lot
with other kids either. Ahsan... - Are we the reason our daughter is--
- We? This was your decision. You always clap with two hands, Ahsan. Sabiha, I was ready to do anything for Aiza
until the very end. Anything! To even be tied in a loveless,
passion less marriage. But have you ever listened to anyone? Ahsan, this is not about us. This is about our daughter. And whatever we have to do now,
we have to do it for Aiza. So you took the responsibility, right? Your brought her here. "I'll do the job
and I'll raise my daughter too." You want to be a superwoman, right? Ready? I want results! Aim! Fire! Look at the target then fire! Again! Fire! Keep the target in the sight of the pistol. Again! Fire! You didn't even hit one target. I'm not talking to you as your uncle,
but as your boss. If this goes on like this,
then you won't be able to pass out. Look at me when I talk to you, cadet! Are you okay? Yes, Sir. You've started again. This is a police academy! Every cadet here is tested for drugs.
You know that, right? You are the chief. Do whatever you think is right. Child... I'm worried about you. Why don't you understand? Is that all, Sir? M... May I go? Thank you, Sir. I'm fine. I'm always fine. Everything I've seen,
the pain I've been through... I can never let my daughter
go through the same pain. I won't punish my daughter for my actions. Mama! Mama! Mama, what happened? Mamma! Mamma!
