Don't come ahead!  Don't come ahead,
I'll kill him! I am telling you.  Don't come ahead!
I'm telling you I'll kill him! Kill!  Kill, kill! Good job, Sabiha. So?  How's everything going? Fine. I mean, as fine as it could be. It's a huge change. I never thought everything would change
so much so fast. When such a huge transition
happens in your life, so... it's natural for a person to get worried.  It doesn't matter who it is. It's completely natural. Change... can also be very uncomfortable
and painful. But this could also be a new start, right? It can open doors that'll make you feel better about
yourself once you get go them. It's possible that you'll see some
qualities, some strengths about yourself... that you didn't know you had in you
maybe. Change can be an opportunity
to redefine yourself. For your own self. Maybe you're right. But it's a little hard to see that
at this point. I'm alone, divorced... how will I raise a little girl? How will I survive in this society? What will happen in the future? I keep thinking about that all the time. It's natural to be scared of the unknown. But this is not the time to think
about your entire life. Right now, you're going through a
very small phase of a very long journey. You should just focus on that. One step in front of another and that's it. And I'm here to help you with that. And? How do you spend the day at home? Like you said... one step at a time. I'm trying to take it day by day. And I'm trying to form a routine. For me and for Azo. How is Aiza? How is she reacting to all of this? She's amazing. Sometimes I feel she is stronger than me. And smart too. And the shifting
isn't completed yet either. We're unpacking things. Kasoor, 2017... and eight-year-old kid, Ghazala,
like everyday she leaves her house for school at 7 a.m.
after having breakfast with her family. Her van stops approximately
1 kilometre away from the house. Her van driver provides pick and drop to
her and some neighborhood kids from there. The neighborhood has employed a sweeper
that sees Ghazala going there every day. There's a general store outside of the
neighborhood that opens at 7:15 a.m. The owner of the store sees Ghazala
going through there every day. On 7th of July, Ghazala leaves her school,
but she doesn't get to her van. The sweeper doesn't see her,
the general store owner doesn't see her. The van driver also leaves
after waiting for five minutes. When the kid doesn't
return home till evening, the parents get worried
and start asking around. They find out that the kid didn't reach
the school either. This spreads throughout the neighborhood
by night. Announcements are made from the mosques
and the search starts. The police get a call at 9 p.m.,
but before the ASP even gets there... some kilo meters away,
the kid's dead body... is found from this trash site. Forensic report... rape. The little girl struggled.
There were bruises on her body. Cause of death... asphyxiation. The little girl was killed by choking. Where will the police investigation
form start? Who is your suspect and why? Yes? Come in, child.  Sit. Rizwan told me that your progress has been
really good. Thank you, Sir. Now I've become "sir" too? Yes, Sir. I'll never get used to this "Sir". How is Aiza? Cadet Sabiha... I've asked you a question. How is your daughter? My daughter is fine, Sir. We've recently shifted.
We're settling in. This is why I've called you here today.
This training is very important. But you've got to pay full attention
to Aiza amidst all of this. I don't want her to be neglected. ok? Sir! Do you have any other problems? No, Sir. Okay, you can go.  Good. Thank you, Sir. And listen. Sir. Give my regards to your mother
if you speak to her. Tell her that Uncle Akbar said
that he would visit on Sunday. Make biryani for dinner.  Is everything right? Sir! -How's your school going, child?  -It
's nice. - Did you make any friends?  -You do
n't make friends so fast. I'll inspect, think it through
and then befriend people. And how are your classes going? They're going good, child. - I'm getting to learn a lot.
- Did you make any friends? You don't make friends so fast. I'll inspect, think it through
and then befriend people. Very good!  Besides, we have each other,
right? We have Nano, Uncle Sameer, and Baba. Azo, my love... Baba is only there for you. - Azo, should I serve you food?
-No, I am not hungry. Eat your dinner so that you can sleep.
You have school in the morning too. Let's do one thing. Should we eat chips?  Spicy ones? I'll eat chips! Sister, she had chips yesterday as well. It's not good to consume
so much oil every day. Shabana, we'll have chips for dinner.   Is
everything right? All right, Sister.  Azo, you wash
your hands.  I'll get the chips. Is Azo ready? She'll be ready in five minutes. Come inside. No, I'll wait in the car. Ahsan, come inside.  It's not an issue.
Please. Sit. No.  I'm okay. Great apartment. It's nice. That's enough for us. Besides, we're still setting it up, so... And Aiza? Obviously, for Azo too. She's decorating her room by her choice. She'll be fine. All of this might be okay for you, but... Aiza isn't used to a life like this. Ahsan, nobody knows what's good for
my daughter and what isn't better than me. Our...daughter. Right.  Our daughter. That's the only reason
you're standing here today. I can understand
it must be really tough for you. Every divorce has its own challenges.
Especially if there are kids involved too. I just don't want my daughter to suffer
because of my decisions. You're a mother. Even during this difficult time,
your first priority is your daughter. No mother can see their kids in pain. To protect them is our basic instinct. But you'll only be able to look after her
if you're fine yourself. I'm fine. I'm always fine. Everything seems fine from the outside. We suppress our feelings and keep going on. But to suppress everything like this, it's not good for you long term.  Is it possible that there is a storm hiding
inside this peace that... will take everything with it? Whatever I've seen,
the pain that I've gone through... I can never let my daughter go through that
pain. I will not punish my daughter
for my decisions. Yes, yes.  You don't worry at all.
I've called her parents. Yes, yes.  I'll let you know as soon
as I speak to them. -May I come in?
- Come, come. Please come. Come, sit. Sorry, Mr.  Shah, for calling you during
working hours. I know you're very busy.  It doesn't matter.  But what has happened here? Sabiha has been having a problem
with a student since the last few days. And I noticed it too.
But it crossed a line today.  -Both of them had a physical altercation.
-No, Ma'am. - I didn't start the fight.  Sania just--
- Quiet! We're talking, right? One of my students is admitted to a
hospital and it is because of your daughter. Which girl did you fight? It's not a girl, but a boy.  Muhammad Amjad.
He's her class fellow. Your daughter cracked open his skull!
Do you know how angry his parents are? They've asked me to suspend your daughter
right away. And I'm going to do it! But Sabiha is saying that she didn't start
the fight. Did you ask the other classmates
what happened? Look, I have no need to ask others. One of my students is admitted
in a hospital. And this is all because of your daughter. I didn't start it, Ma'am.
Amjad used to bother Sania everyday. He bullied her.  She cries everyday. And I told him not to do it multiple times
but he fought with me too. And today when he bullied Sania
and I intervened, so he started fighting with me and-- You should've come to me.  Who gave you
the right to do it all by yourself? All due respect, Ma'am... I'm a policeman.  Both parties come to me,
we listen to everyone. But you labeled my daughter as the
guilty party without even listening to her. Sorry, Mr.  Shah.
This is not your police station. One of my students is admitted in
a hospital and I'm answerable for it. And my final decision is to suspend
your daughter. Then you should hear my decision too. I want to take my daughter far away
for a week from a place where she was protecting her class fellow
and she's being punished for it. What are you teaching the kids? Very sad. Let's go, Sabiha. And yes. I've decided that my daughter will attend
karate classes for a week. So that if it ever happens again,
she's not hurt. Baba, what did you do?  You got me suspended
for two weeks instead of one? Oh, forget it.  We'll enjoy a lot
these two weeks. And besides, when do we ever get time
to enjoy together? - Is the pain too much?
-No, I'm fine. Brave girl. Sorry, Baba.  Mama will be very angry,
right? Oh, you didn't do anything wrong. You stood for a weak person
against a powerful one. I am proud of you. In your life, you... have to fight sometimes. And in the future, you'll have to
fight these battles again and again. Child, remembers one thing. Whenever you fight... fight for a purpose. And when you fight for that purpose, then fight without fear. And if you have to fight... always fight to win. I'm amazed and he's worried. I asked was it a boy, she said yes.
I asked where is he? She said Sabiha cracked open his skull
and he's at the hospital. A boy's?  Our Sabiha did it? Man, Sabiha, that was amazing.
You're just like your father. Very good.  Amazing! Brother Akbar, please.
At least you don't encourage her. Oh, you just give me yakhni pulao.
That's it. Don't know what he's turning his daughter
into. Nice!  There, the principal suspended
the daughter. And here?  Here the wife is suspending
her husband. But between us,
Sabiha did the right thing to that guy. Now he's gonna think 100 times
before bullying someone. Oh, not a 100. He's gonna
think a 1000 times!  Very good. Please Shah!  How much more are you gonna
spoil her? I'm the one who has to handle it later. How is she going to spend these two weeks
out of school? She is going to take karate classes.  Do you think it's funny? Brother Akbar,
we know about your whereabouts. How is he?  Where is he?
We knew nothing about him for weeks. Do you have any idea how I spend this time? I wake up at night to pray for you
in case something happened to you. Oh God, protect him! I don't even know if you think so or not. But if something happened to you,
so... what will become of us? Oh, Khadija, nothing will happen.
You're getting worried for no reason. Shah, I'm not getting worried needlessly
and all three of us know that. Why are you putting your life
through so much danger? Is your duty above your family? Yes. If I won't do it... then someone else will do it. He must have a family too, right? Man, someone has to do it, right? For us, for our kids. All right. Do whatever you want. Go and perform your duty. We can all go to hell. You go on and perform your duty. Sister-in-law is right, man.
You should think about it. These undercover assignments
are very dangerous. You talk to the boss
and get yourself transferred. I've gotten to him
after a lot of hard work, Akbar. After getting so close, I can't just leave it in the middle.
Impossible. Man, what are you doing? You guys are about to have another baby. Leave it, man.  Think about your family.
what are you doing? It won't take a lot of time. There's a shipment
coming in from Afghanistan and he's asked me to oversee it. You just tell the boss to be prepared.
I'll let you know as soon as I get a tip. Nobody should even get a wind of it though. Not even within the force. He has his people inside. -Just you and I and the boss.
-Man! Oh, nothing will happen. Rehman has full trust in me.
He doesn't even know who I am. Nothing will happen to me. And you're there to save me. Can something happen to me
when you're there? Just... you wait and see. Everything will be fine. Baba! You didn't sleep yet? Baba, don't go.  Please. Why, child? I'm getting scared.  Please don't go. What's there to get scared of? I'll be back in a few days. I want you to be a strong girl. You have to take care of the house after me.
You're grown up now! I love you. I love you too. Standard issue Beretta 92 fs pistol. This will be your main weapon. Forever with you on the field. Your partner. A police officer never... uses their weapon needlessly
and without thinking. But if you had to take it out... you can't miss your target. Is that clear? Pick up the weapon in front of you. And load it. On my mark... ready? Aim! Fire! Again. Ready? Aim! Fire! Fire! Sabiha, fire. Sir, give her a blaster gun again.
That'll be good for her. Quiet! What happened, cadet? Why are you not firing? - Sir, I got dizzy.
-You got dizzy? If someone was shooting at you in
the field, what will you say to them? You got dizzy? All the others were firing too! Take aim at them and fire. Aim! And fire! Again! Aim! Fire! Sabiha, fire! Again, ready! Aim! Fire! And once again. Ready! Aim! Theory- top of the class. Investigation- top of the class. Tactical training – top of the class. Weapon training... last position. Rizwan was telling me that... you couldn't even fire once. Why? S... Sir, it's just... Sabiha, talk to me properly. Uncle Akbar, I don't know what happened. I felt as if I had darkness in front of
my eyes at the time of the shooting. I couldn't understand anything.  I was dizzy
and I felt as if I'd pass away. Look, child, when you stubbornly joined
the police force... I advised you then too... that this isn't for everyone to do. You were good at your studies. You excelled at it too. Working in a police force is very brutal.
Who knows it better than you? Anyway, there's still time.
You can change careers if you want. No, Uncle. I'll work hard and try harder. Not everything can be solved by trying
and hard work. I can't just leave it in the middle
when I've come so far. You're really your father's daughter. He used to say the same thing. There's something wrong. It can't be
that he'll miss Sabiha's birthday. You... you please find it out. Please find out.  S
something is not right. I've inquired from all my informants. There's no news of Shah. - But we're trying--
- What do you mean by that? I don't know. I want my husband alive and well
at my home right now! You people sent him, right?
You people sent him! You're going to bring him back.  Do
you understand? Do something!  Brother Akbar, do something. Do something, Brother Akbar! Let's talk about your father. My father? He was a good man. Oh, man, someone has to do it, right? For us.  For our kids. If I won't do it... then someone else will do it. He'll have a family too, right? A good father. - I love you.
- I love you. We've just received a news that a tortured
dead body of a police inspector, Saeed Shah, was just found on a track
near a railway station. Sources say that there are signs
of extreme torture on the body and the dead body has been maligned badly. And now?  After so many years? How do you feel about his death now? Police department says that Inspector Shah
was a part of an undercover investigation. My entire life was spent in his memories. It was as if a part of my body was buried
along with him that day. His memory has been reduced to tears... that is stuck like a thorn in my soul. A tear... that doesn't even get dry and... doesn't fall either.
