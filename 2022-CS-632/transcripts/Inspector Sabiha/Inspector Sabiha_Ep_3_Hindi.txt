Yesterday, I saw Aiza playing 
with her parrot, Mithoo. She feeds him. She loves him a lot, she talks to him 
as if he understands everything. She's very attached to her parrot. Whenever we go sit in the lawn,
she brings him with her. And then... sometimes she cleans her cage
and leaves the door open. And you know... Mithoo doesn't fly. But if you look at it, Mithoo is caged 
forever in that bird cage. He has a clear sky ahead of him,
freedom too, but... he doesn't fly. Maybe... he's scared of freedom. Or maybe... the birds that are caged... they forget how to fly. The little girl struggled. 
There are bruises on her body. Cause of death... asphyxiation. The little girl was killed 
by being strangled. Who will the police investigation 
start from? Who is your suspect and why? Sabiha? Who is your suspect? All of them. Who all? The sweeper, the shop keeper, the van driver... the whole neighborhood 
and the school teachers. And the parents. And all the other relatives 
that live in the house. The parents. Why the parents? Lie. Everyone lies. Correct! The number one rule of investigation is
that everyone lies. Some for themselves, some for others. The job of the police
is to discover the truth and there's one way
to discover the truth. To find the lies. Light and dark... virtue and mischief... truth and lie... life and death. All of these things are defined
through their opposites. Not on their own. Remember; everyone is a suspect. Do you see the time? She's asleep. Why was your phone off? You know how worried I was? I told you we were going to the water park. She was with her father. 
What's there to worry about? What do you mean 
"what's there to worry about"? You said you'll bring her back home
at 6 o'clock in the evening. Did you see the time? 
It's 10 o'clock at night! She was being stubborn, 
she was on the water slides. She was enjoying herself. I let her enjoy!
What happened? Ahsan, listen to something carefully. You'll bring my daughter back home
at the time we decide. Even if you're late by 10 minutes,
you'll call and let me know. Take it as a first and final warning. Khadija, we really like your daughter. We can finalize things if these two agree. Yes. Ahsan, talk to her. Mother... Sabiha, talk to each other. Mother, here? Right in front of everyone? What's wrong with you? Oh, it's all family here. Sabhi, child... go on, show Ahsan around the grounds. Sister-in-law has decorated the gardens 
really well. Go, child. Sorry about that. 
Mom is a little old fashioned. Doesn't matter. It became really awkward, right? I'll tell you something about myself. Then you can tell me something 
about yourself. I'm an only child.
I used to play cricket in school. I wanted to play professionally. Then I realized my passion 
was more than my talent. I went to the US for college. Then I worked at a bank there 
for some time. We're in the textile industry 
and you're no interested in these things. No, no, it's not like that. Look, the thing is, all of this was written
in your CV. Your favorite color, hobbies... 
something else. Man, I didn't make the CV myself.
I find it very stupid. But at instances like these, 
people always put their best foot forward. But can I tell you something? Today I saw my parents talking 
after months. We live in the same house... but not like a family. They never had the guts to separate
in fear of the society. We look like a normal family. But only just for show. No family is perfect. I read it somewhere. And the families that are happy, 
they're all... they're almost happy in a similar way. Cars, houses... comfort, birthdays. Whereas, the families that are unhappy,
they... they're all unhappy 
in their own unique ways. Tolstoy. - You've read him?
- A little bit. By the way, Ahsan, the scope for happiness
is really narrow, no? And sadness is just that much bigger. Joy and sadness are parallel to each other. That's what life is. But I have a hope. That when I have my own family, I won't repeat the same mistakes
my parents did. And the traumas I've been through... I want to my child as far away from them
as possible. And try to build a life 
that's full of happiness, no matter how narrow the scope
for happiness is. Regardless of how it ended... you must've spent 
some good times together too? Of course. All relationships are good 
at the beginning. Ours was too. I love you. I hate you! Sabiha? Sabiha! Sabiha! Your daughter is waiting for you
at breakfast. Have some fear of God, man! Adan wanted to be the prince but the
teacher said he didnâ€™t know the lines. So she didn't give him any role.
He was super upset. So I told the teacher to give him
some role at least. Then you know what's the role
the teacher gave him? The one which had no lines.
You know what did he get? What? A tree! He's a tree. He was very upset so I told him 
being a tree is fun. Because you get to stand tall and strong
like a real one.  All right, Aazo, child. Time to go. The car is ready. - Papa, 2 minutes.
- Child. We're getting late. Aazo, time to go, child. Fine. Take care. Have a good day! - Good bye!
- Good bye! Okay, listen. I'll go to abroad for a few meetings
for a few days. Do not miss Aiza's play.
She was very excited about it. When will you come back, Ahsan? Why? Will you miss me? Ahsan, what did you think about it? Thought about what? About CSS. I was thinking to appear
for exams this time. I have the time too now.
Aiza has also started going to the school. Do you think you're in a condition
to appear for CSS exams? Ahsan, that's what we spoke about before,
right? You always say no. Every year. First I missed it because of the kid.
Then I missed it in order to raise her. Now I'm at home all the time
and I have nothing to do. I can do it. You're in a mess right now. You've started the pills again? Right now, I'd suggest that you focus
on Aiza. And more importantly, focus on yourself. I'll be back on Sunday. Remember... don't miss Aiza's play. You're late. Mom? I've to talk to you about something. Talk. Nothing is okay at the house. The situation... What happened? Nothing is all right... between Ahsan and I. There's a lot of distance. We don't even talk anymore. So? So, Mom, what do I do? What's there to do? It's a marriage. That's how marriages are. Mom, we'll have to do something. My life has become a death sentence. So what do you want? Passion? Love? These bookish things have nothing to do
with life at all. Let it go on how it's going on. This is life. It goes on. Why are you like this, Mom? Whatever happened to you, 
it happened to all of us too. If you were widowed, 
then we were orphaned too. If you worked hard, 
tried to be there for us... everything could've been fine. But, Mom, you... left us alone despite being alive. I raised you guys. Wrong. I've raised myself. I've raised Sameer. And, Mom, I've raised you too. So why you acting as
if you've done a favor? Did I ask you to become everyone's mother? Someone had to be. You couldn't do it. Tell me something truthfully. Did you ever love me? No. I couldn't love you. You know why? I always saw your father in you. I still do. The man who ruined my life. She didn't leave me in a
state to show anyone my face. When I hate him so much... then how could I love you? It's not your fault. But there are some... things that humans have no control over. Did Aiza go to school? I got late in getting home last night. Really? Is this tea? Safdar! 
Please bring fresh tea. Then? How were your meetings? The usual. They were fine. And where were these meetings? Today... you're taking a lot of interest in my life. They were in Karachi. Some cafe is being opened.
There are talks about its investment. It's a creative space 
for writers/ thinkers types. It's an interesting concept. Tell me... how was Aiza's place? I really wanted to be there. Interesting. And? Did it hurt? Of course. It hurts. But why all of this happened, 
I... understand. I feel to know 
that in all of this situation, you... you think yourself 
to be equally responsible. But nothing justifies cheating. I know what Ahsan did. But I'm also aware of what I did. I read somewhere that... the families that are happy, they all... are happy in the same way. Cars, house, servants, comfort. Whereas the families that are unhappy,
they are all... unhappy in a different and unique way. The scope for happiness
is so narrow, right? And sadness is so vast.
