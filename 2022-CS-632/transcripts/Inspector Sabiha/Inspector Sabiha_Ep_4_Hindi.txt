Maybe Shah forgot 
if he's a police officer or a criminal. Look at the target and fire. Fire! Ahsan, listen to something very carefully. Take this as the first
and the last warning. I raised myself! - And, Mom, I raised you too!
- So why are you telling me that? I know what Ahsan did. Sabiha, I was ready to do anything 
for Aiza. Anything! Mama! How can I help you? Are you computerizing the records? Yes. How far has it reached? I told Sir that day as well. I'm one man.
It takes some time. But still. How far have you come? I've reached 2015. Can I help you? I wanted to ask if a cadet wants access
to some old records... what's the process for it? You guys aren't authorized. For research purposes. If there's an order from the higher ups,
then it's possible. But that doesn’t usually happen. What's it to you guys? Not everyone passes on. I was just looking. I told you it's not authorized 
for the cadets! You either get clearance 
from the higher ups or leave! Or should I tell the Commander? Everyone just comes here! Your Training Academy session 
is almost about to end. Every year, there's a specialized training
organized at the end of the year. Top cadets from the entire country 
take part in that. You will also be divided into batches 
of tens like other cadets. And every cadet 
will go through a combine course. Legal, theory, operational... and firearm combat. These cadets are the best of the best.  For an entire week, every cadet will be
measured though every test in every way. From there it'll be decided which cadets
will become field officers, who will be "kudday lined",
and who will go back to being civilians. I've taught you people what I could've. It's in your hands from here on out. So give it your best. And don't embarrass me. - Aazo?
- Yes? - How was your day today?
- Very good! We had so much fun. What did you do? We went to a park for a picnic. First we went on to the slides, 
then the swings. And Nadia Auntie made such tasty foods;
burgers, sandwich, pizza. I really missed you. I missed you too, child. Yeah, Aazo. How do you like Nadia Auntie? Yes! She's so nice and loves me a lot.
And I love her too. And Dad? Is your dad happy? Yes, Dad's happy. Nadia Auntie's so funny,
we just laugh all the time. I'll be back till Sunday. If you need anything for Aazo from Dubai,
text me. How long has this been going on? As a woman, 
I, at least, have the right to ask this. Approximately six months. How'd you meet? At a mutual friend's lunch. And then? We talked and exchanged numbers. And then... And both of you directly went to Paris. Ahsan never told you that he has a wife
and a daughter? I'm so sorry! I'm not the kind of woman you think I am. I couldn't ever even think that I'd
be involved in a situation like this. Okay, tell me. 
What kind of a woman are you? Do you love him? And does he love you? Yeah. Wow. Everything is connected to each other. The special training course for you cadets
is a weeklong. Classes will be resumed from tomorrow
and so will the physical training. Instructors will mark you at every stage. And at the end of the training, one cadet from you will become 
the top position holder. Best of the best. Winner of the prestigious Sword of Honor. I know some of you, but still.
Introduce yourself to each other. - Saleem Afridi, Peshawar Division, Sir!
- Sarfaraz Parvez, Quetta Division, Sir! - Kashif Chaudry, Lahore Division, Sir!
- Sabiha Shah, Lahore Division, Sir! - Aftab Nabi, Karachi Division, Sir!
- Sajid Hussain, Karachi Division, Sir! Maybe it seems glamorous on TV 
and in films. But you all have a big responsibility
as a police officer! To maintain peace and quiet. You'll get calls every other day from
various neighborhoods about many fights. Your job is to mediate. And to take actions against those
that provoke the emotions of the people, arrest them and prosecute them. Okay? Question. Getting a group of public to fight another. Gathering people at a place 
with the intention of causing disturbance. Which Article will be implemented 
if the FIR is filed? - Section 153-A of Pakistan Penal Court.
- Title? Promoting enmity between different groups. And 153-B? Inducing students to take
part in political activity. Very good. Another question. A driver injured a cyclist by his car,
but the cyclist didn't die. - When the FIR will be filed for it--
- Sir? Section 337-G and section 337-H. Very good, Sabiha. Very good. Now let's talk about the concept of qisas,
diyat and arsh. Page number 245. Everyone, please. Madam! Yes? Sajid Hussain, Karachi Division. Sabiha Shah, Lahore Division. I know. You give really good answers. Very impressive. 
It seems as if you've prepared a lot! Thank you! I wanted to say 
that please give us a chance too! We should also be able to answer 
1 or 2 questions. There'll be a marking for this,
so we'll get some numbers. If you knew the answers, 
then why didn't you speak up? Oh, you didn't give me a chance. 
I was standing there with my hands raised. So next time, Mr. Sajid, give answers 
along with raising your hands. Look, Ms. Sabiha, I don't know how it works
in Lahore, but... the people of Karachi 
keep everyone together. Like friends. Mr. Sajid, let me make one thing clear. I'm not here to make friends.
I'm here to become a police officer. And, at the end of the day, 
this is a competition. All right then. If this is a competition,
then I’ll meet you on the field. We'll see what happens there. I'll win and show you. No matter what. Good luck. - False evidence?
- Section 191 of Pakistan Penal Code, Sir. And also 209 if the evidence is presented
at the court. Very good. If you've given refuge to a criminal? - 21--
- 212, Sir. 212. Good. Fire, Sabiha! Fire! Fire the gun, Madam. The culprits
have crossed Sheikhupura toll. Quiet! Sabiha, fire! And fire. I rarely ever saw the use of section 271
in my career. But it was used during the pandemic
to enforce the quarantine. What I want to say is thorough knowledge
of the law is very important for the exercise of law enforcement. Sir? Yes? Sir, you mentioned so
many laws for the public, so, Sir, is any law implemented 
on the police too? Of course. I mean, Sir, there must be a punishment
there if a policeman broke the law, right? Sir, I've also heard that some policemen
became criminals themselves while working. Right, Brothers? Such cases have happened,
right? - Absolutely.
- Sure. I mean, if the people
who protect the law started breaking it, then they should get
some punishment too, no? - Absolutely!
- Absolutely! So speak up! That's what I'm saying. Police officers are not above the law. We have a very robust system of
internal affairs present in our department. If a police officer breaks a law, then same law will be enforced
on them as a common civilian. What was this? What do you mean what was it? You know exactly what I'm talking about. Did something happen in the class room? How dare you? What did you find out? Not just me, Madam. Everyone knows. But nobody says anything 
because they're scared of you. - They're scared.
- Your uncle's there, DIG Sir. You don't know anything! They all lie! Spew nonsense! My father was a good man 
and an even better officer. Whether I know something or not, but I do know how this system is made
to facilitate people like you. I've passed CSS exams! And I've as much right to be here
as you do! It's better if you don't talk about rights. Your father's record was locked in a file,
and he was given an awards and buried. Do you even know what my father used to do? He was a fruit seller.
He used to sell fruits to people like you. He scarified everything to get me here. For you, it all must be an
interesting thing to do, Madam. Or maybe a family tradition.
But, for me, it's a war. Against this system. Everything's fair in love and war. You know nothing about the fire 
I've been through to get here. And I don't need any help to get 
to where I want to be. And no one can come in my way either! We'll know it soon. But I will say one thing. If you win, I'll come to salute you myself. Because people like us... we know how to win 
and how to loose. You won't be able to do it
even if you practice like for a 100 years. It won't happen until you smash the statue
of your fear. Life a is a difficult journey 
for people like you, Sabiha. The fire that gives you strength,
it also burns you to ashes. You're exactly like your father. Si... Sir, you knew him? I worked with him, and... he was my first boss. And he was a good officer. There were a lot of people amongst us that
weren't satisfied with the inquiry report. They could've done more. There were witnesses
that we could've spoken to, but the situation in the
country was such that... File closed, case solved. Sir, why didn't you do something
for so many years? It doesn't work like that. Time goes on and the world forgets. But you didn't forget. Sabiha, there are a lot of people 
in the department who have high expectations of you. The biggest step stone of your way
is your own fear. If you want to get to the truth... then learn to win against yourself. Cadets, it's a reminder call. 
15 minutes remaining. Excuse me! Sir. - Sir.
- Oh, you're done too? He'll always remain a martyr 
in front of the public. The file has been closed. Maybe... everything... will be buried inside a cupboard forever. Child, remember one thing. whenever you fight, fight for a purpose. And when you find that purpose,
fight without fear. And if you have to fight... always fight to win. Sir! Madam-- I mean, Madam Sir! What do you do all day sitting here, 
Qurban Ali? I'm in search of a file.
