For you, it all must be an
interesting thing to do, Madam. Or maybe a family tradition.
But, for me, it's a war. You know nothing about the fire 
I've been through to get here. My daughter can't live without me! Forget her, you can't even take
care of yourself! You're an addict! You need help. If you want to get to the truth... then learn to win against yourself. whenever you fight, fight for a purpose. And when you find that purpose,
fight without fear. And if you have to fight... always fight to win. Evidence. I want a divorce. And my daughter will go with me.
You can meet her on the weekends. If you accept it then fine.  Otherwise, the entire world will see
this evidence tomorrow. Sir! Madam-- I mean, Madam Sir! What do you do all day sitting here, 
Qurban Ali? Madam, I'm an electrical engineer. They enrolled me into police
for technological advancements, but they've put me on files. I make these devices in my free time,
but no one has ever taken an interest. What is this? Extended range acoustic monitoring system
with GSM integration. Huh? Basically, it's a bugging device. If put in a room, it can caption the
range of voice till about 10 meters. Where do you put it? It can be stuck under any table
and no one pays any attention either. Does it even work? Speak freely, Qurban Ali. 
There's no need to be scared. It's just between us. I swear to God we don't take it
because we like to. But we have to feed our wives 
and children too. And besides, family members taunt me
that I'm an ASI yet I still have a scooter. Man... Sir, when a person comes to
the police station, we help him too! If someone gives us 1000 or 2000
as a gift, so is it nice to say no?
I don't even feel like saying no. I'm looking for a file, Qurban Ali. The file is from which date, Madam? 2007 to 2008. What's the name of the file? Inspector Saeed Shah. It was an internal inquiry. Such an old file, Madam. 
And who is this Inspector Shah? How are you, Madam SP? Perfectly fine. You tell me. I'm perfectly fine 
and I'm going back to Karachi. So I thought I'd meet you. 
I owe you a salute. No, no. There's no need for that. There is a need. I couldn't understand you correctly. And maybe I didn't understand you. The thing is; I don't have any faith 
in the system. Because of that I've gotten used to seeing
everyone with a skeptical eye. But meeting you and losing to you
felt really nice. So tell me; what are your plans ahead? Did you get your posting finalized? Yes, I've gotten my first posting - 
Karachi East. Let's see what I can do. It's a very tough posting. No, no. I've spent a lot of time in those streets. I know it thoroughly. I'll use that as an advantage on the field. Although you're smarter than I am, 
Mr. Sajid, but... be careful. Work carefully. Always one step in front of another. And yes, if you need anything here 
in Lahore, then call me directly. Non matter how the system is, you'll always a find a good partner
and a good friend here. He beats me up every other day! He hits me over small, small things. No matter how big or small the issue is,
he can't control his hands, Madam. She's spewing nonsense, Madam!
She's lying! She's brought all the matters of the home
to the police station. - She just wants to irritate me!
- I'm the one who's lying? Day before yesterday, he came at 3 in the
morning and asked me cook him a hot roti! I told him to reheat it 
since I already cooked it. He hit me so much, Madam! Look at this,
I've bruises all over my hands. I came home at 3 after working all day! I only asked for a hot roti so
she said "heat it up yourself"! Quiet! - Arif?
- Yes, Madam? Come here! Take him to the lock up. Take him to the lock up 
and take out his anger. - His blood is very warm!
- Yes, Madam. - Oh, please forgive me! Please forgive.
- Madam! - Oh! Sir, please forgive me.
- Madam, Madam, Madam! - Madam, Madam!
- I won't do it again! - Madam, Madam!
- I won't do it again! Give us one chance, Madam. 
He said he won't do it again. Yes. That's it? That's what your masculinity was? You're a tiger when you hit her! What happened now? Your legs started shivering? Madam! For God's and the Prophet's sake,
please forgive me! I won't do it again! Oh! Don't bring God and the Prophet 
into this! You've done this yourself 
and you're bringing in God! And you! Wives like you,  you tolerate the beatings 
and others have to too. Arif! Leave them! And do one thing; note down their address.
Keep on checking them on your way. And if it ever happens again, 
bring him in again. We'll take out his heat once again. Get lost! Get up! - Thank you very much, Madam.
- Get lost from here! Thank you very much. - Thank you very much, Madam.
- Come on. Let's go! Thank you very much, Madam.
Come on, come on. Hurry up. Come. Hurry up, come on. - Salam! You were very late today.
- Salam! This is how it's going to be now. Aiza was really sick today. What happened? She said she had a stomach ache,
maybe she ate something at school. - Then?
- I gave her kichdi, she's asleep now. - Okay, I'll see her.
- Won't you eat something? No. - In fact, do one thing. Get me coffee.
- All right, I'll get it. Madam, records are saved 
according to the dates. I searched all the boxes from 2007 to 2008.
But I couldn't find your file. Then I took out each and every file
and read through it. So I found this file. There's no name on this file,
no is there a cover page on this. We all thought he was Shah. But he transformed into Shakir. As much as we investigated... we kept finding his crimes. But his funeral? All of you buried him, right? This was the department's decision. Entire police force's name would've been
tarnished had it come out to the public. After all... he was our brother. This is why Mr. IG and all of us decided 
that... all of us will remember his service,
not his crime. That day, not Shakir... but Inspector Shah was honored. We buried our brother. But, Uncle, 
why didn't you ever say something? Why did you let us all live on a lie? I promised him. That I'll take care of all of you. I'll protect you. I couldn't break my promise. For that... what's a little lie? I could've sacrificed my life for it. And Rehman? He ran off to Dubai. Then Kenya from there. And then he vanished. Some people say he was killed there
in a fight with local gangsters. Sabiha, child... we did whatever we could've. Your career is just starting now. I'm not your father, but... but I'm advising you because I think of you
as my daughter. Don't dig old graves. The black spot that's on you
and your family... you can wash it away with your good
and honest service. Some truths... are better off buried. Hello? I'm on duty. 
What do you want to talk about? What happened to Aazo? Which hospital? Okay. You've finally come? I was calling you 
since so long! Me and the school. Aazo is fighting for her life here
and you can't make time with your job? Is that why you brought my daughter 
with you? Ahsan, don't start everywhere at all times. Besides, it's not like you've done me
any favors by looking after your daughter. She's your daughter! Sabiha, favor and responsibility 
are two very separate things. You know what's making the difference? The time that you want to spend with
your wife, it has actually affected that. You're an extremely selfish man. You're against Nadia for no reason. She's coming here to spend time with Aazo
leaving everything behind. She's going to come here? 
To spend time with Aazo? Somebody has to stay here with her. Ahsan, I want to tell you something
very calmly. You made her your wife, I don't care. But if you tried to make that woman
the mother of my kid... So what? Now you're going 
to wear that uniform and threaten me? Take it as a threat. There's no need for that, Sir. Rules are rules, Madam. 
Maybe... I taught you that. Qurban told me 
that you went through the records. Did you find that file? Yes. I found it and saw everything. The man I thought of as a hero 
my entire life... I saw his reality too. What you saw, you believed it all as it is? There's a whole inquiry report. All the details are in there. Madam, you have a lot of trust
on the system. I told you what it's written in the report
is not the whole truth. Then what is the whole truth? And if you know the whole truth,
then why didn't you tell me? Because I don't know 
what the truth is either. But there is one person 
who knows the entire story. - Who?
- Rehman Lala. Rehman Lala is dead. Madam, do you know 
what's the devil's biggest strength? Lies. Cheating. Fraud. These strong people can easily hide anyone
when they want to shelter them. Rehman Lala is alive? This is not my war, Madam. I... can't fight this system. This is your war. If you want to fight this system,
you can try. There's a doctor near old Anarkali,
Wasson market. All criminals of the city go to meet him. A cripple man comes there for treatment. His name is Ashraf. You should meet him. Maybe you'll find out the truth
you've been looking for your whole life. Yes, man. How much is it for? - How much?
- 40 rupees. 40 rupees, all right. And this? All right. All right. - Yes, Arif?
- Madam, I found Ashraf. - Where is he?
- Madam, he just left from the doctor's. He's buying vegetables.
I'm right behind him. He shouldn't get away, Arif. Don't worry, Madam. He won't go anywhere. Madam, he's gotten into a rickshaw. - Arif, go after him.
- Madam, I don't have the money. Shame on you! You're a policeman. Madam, he's going into the street.
The street is closed off ahead. I think his house is around here somewhere. Yes, Madam, I found Ashraf's house.
Should I send you the location? Yes, send it. I'm coming. Hello? I need your help. Thank you for coming. Madam, this is Ashraf's house. - Did someone come here?
- No, Madam. No one came here. All right. You can go now. Madam, should I come with you?
In case there's a problem. I'll handle it. Go. Coming. Yes? Can I meet Ashraf? Who are you? What do you want? ASP Sabiha Shah. I'm Shakir's daughter.
