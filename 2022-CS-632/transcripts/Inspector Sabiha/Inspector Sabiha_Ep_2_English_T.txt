[85.24] Sister-in-law, I'm very sorry.
Shah was a good officer.
[91.55] And I have full faith that he was also
a good husband and a good father.
[97.48] We're with you through your pain.
[101.44] Thank you, Sir.
[102.96] Akbar...
[104.99] where are the arrangements for the
pension papers, martyr funds and benefits?
[109.40] No, Sir, everything's in the process
on urgent basis.
[112.54] Good.
[115.13] Now all you can do is be patient.
Whatever God wills.
[120.67] Sir, there was something I wanted
to talk to you about.
[123.70] Yes, yes, tell me.
[126.00] Sir, thank you for everything
you've done for me.
[131.15] But, Sir, right now we...
[133.95] we don't need sympathizers.
[136.88] We need justice.
[140.15] Me for my husband
and my daughter for her father.
[146.34] Akbar, what are the updates
in the investigation?
[150.69] Sir, Rehman is missing.
[153.59] Our informants told us that he has run off
to Dubai.
[156.92] And there's no proof anyway, Sir,
[159.69] that whether he committed
this murder himself...
[161.81] or he had done it from someone else.
[164.70] It means it could be someone else too.
[168.00] Sir, the conditions Shah was working under,
there was a lot of danger there.
[173.73] He told me that some things are
coming through Afghanistan
[178.19] that these people were targeting.
[181.39] You mean there could be some
foreign involvement too?
[187.71] Yes, Sir, that's absolutely a possibility.
[191.80] Look, Sister-in-law...
[193.85] Akbar is overseeing
this investigation himself.
[197.08] I'll contact you as soon
as we get some updates.  Is
[200.75] everything right?
[203.38] Sir...
[205.22] please put more people on this.
[209.63] And if you know Rehman has run off to
Dubai, then why don't you guys catch him?
[215.25] Look, this is not such an easy task.
[218.55] And that, too, in these conditions.
[221.77] There are blasts happening every day.
[223.92] 36 of my officers and soldiers
were martyred last year.
[228.04] How many people am I gonna investigate for?
[231.77] You can at least get justice
for the officer that...
[236.16] you sent yourself to die!
[238.46] Whose wife was made into a widow and
children into orphans by your decisions.
[242.69] - Sister-in-law... -
What?
[244.38] Look, this was an undercover mission.
He was willing to do it.
[249.36] He insisted on heading it.
Despite me refusing it multiple times.
[254.00] He didn't step out of it.
[255.64] Ask Akbar.  He asked him to back off too.
[260.50] Look, I didn't want to discuss it with you.
[263.11] But the investigation is pointing out
that maybe Shah forgot...
[268.64] whether he is a police officer
or a criminal.
[273.15] Sir, please.
[276.75] I apologize.
[279.10] Look, this is an internal matter.
[282.21] You have no concern with this.
[289.43] You...
[291.40] are calling my martyr husband...
[294.57] a criminal?
[297.48] And I have no concern with that?
[303.58] If I knew his own people were
going to treat him this way,
[308.19] then I would never come to you
looking for justice.
[311.12] Get up!
[313.04] Look, the truth is going to come
out one day.  I promise you this.
[321.43] Sir!
[325.30] How can this happen now, Brother Akbar?
[328.69] No one knew Shah better than you.
[335.36] Tell me, Sister-in-law...
[340.42] he lived two lives for a lot of years... it
[347.15] 's possible that the line between
the two...
[352.72] blurred.
[359.62] This has happened with other officers too.
[366.04] Then why didn't he talk to me?
[368.83] Why didn't he talk to you?
You could've helped him.
[374.48] He might not have wanted to involve you.
[379.78] He might've wanted to protect you
and the family.
[390.28] I can't discuss the things
we're uncovering in the investigation.
[395.56] Maybe...
[398.38] we...
[400.76] weren't able to understand Shah properly.
[404.87] Lie!
[407.27] He couldn't have done it!
[409.41] My husband is not a criminal!
[411.99] He is a martyr!
[414.06] He is a martyr!
[416.51] He will always remain a martyr to the public.
[421.82] This is an internal police matter.
[426.11] The file has been closed.
[430.35] Maybe...
[432.84] everything...
[435.15] will be buried in some cupboard forever.
[441.69] Let's talk about your father.
[445.49] My dad?
[453.05] He was a good man.
[512.27] Sir!
[515.12] You couldn't learn
how to salute in three years!
[517.69] I'll try again, Sir!
[519.85] Let it be.  what are you doing?
[524.72] Sir, the office's CCTV stopped working.
I'm fixing that.
[528.77] There's an issue in the volt meter, Sir.
It is not getting the full 18 volts.
[531.96] So the cameras are glitching.
[534.12] Did we employ you here to computerise
the records or to be an electrician?
[537.61] Don't try to be Einstein
and do your work.
[540.86] The office people gave me these things.
I'm an engineer, as you know.
[544.77] How far are you through with the records?
[547.49] Sir, I'm only one person here.
I have to scan each page separately, Sir.
[550.77] How far?
[552.62] I'm through till 2015.
[560.46] The police department has decided
to computerize their entire records.
[565.79] Up until a few years ago,
[567.19] all the officers used to submit
their files in a handwritten form.
[571.57] Now everything will be computerised.
[590.07] Mamma?
[592.54] - Aazo?  You didn't sleep yet, child?
-Mama, it...
[598.13] what happened?
[600.47] It's my result card.
[602.85] The teacher has told us to get it signed.
[608.54] The teacher has called you to
the school tomorrow for a meeting.
[615.00] Aiza, what are these results, child?
[618.65] Did you not study?
[620.97] Mama, sorry.
[629.85] Okay, child, please.  Don't cry!  It
[632.54] doesn't matter.
We'll work hard the next time.  Is
[635.61] everything right?  Come here, come to me.
[639.15] Come here, sit.  It
[641.41] doesn't matter, child.
[644.04] Don't cry.
[657.42] Amazing, Brother Akbar.
You're not eating anything.
[660.96] No, Sister-in-law, it was amazing!
[663.74] You request me a lot of times
to make Biryani.  -Take
[666.71] a little bit.
-Let it be.
[669.38] I anyway don't fit in the uniform anymore.
[672.47] Okay, serve a little.
[674.79] I'll start dieting form next week then.
[677.59] Today is a cheat day.
[678.85] And you!  Keep your phone down
for two minutes at least.
[682.10] Eat your dinner.
[685.61] Yes?
[688.84] Are you still upset?
[690.64] Who's upset?  What happened?
[693.23] You should ask her this question.
[696.20] Yes, Sabiha, what happened?
[699.67] Uncle, why don't you take me seriously?
[702.32] I told you to keep personal
and professional life separate.
[707.17] Oh, what did I say?
I just asked about your wellbeing.
[711.17] Then don't ask about my wellbeing.
[714.31] I'm just a cadet at the office.
[716.49] What's the big deal?
He only asked about your wellbeing.
[720.06] Why are you getting so serious?
[722.07] Mom, there is something to get serious about.
[724.46] I won't get any special treatment
at the office.  We decided that, yes?
[728.41] Then why am I getting it?
[730.04] Tell me something.  Do you call anyone else
from my team and ask how they're doing?
[735.28] Uncle, please.  Don't single me out.
[738.92] I think you're being unfair.
[741.53] I wasn't singling you out.
[743.66] But it's my right to keep an eye out
on your wellbeing, right?
[748.78] Is it right?
[750.58] Uncle, do you know what's being unfair is?
It's what you do.
[754.75] You ask Commander Sir
for my reports every day.
[758.71] What will my team think of me
if they found out?
[762.28] Uncle, I want to do everything
based on merit.
[765.12] Okay, sorry.
[768.55] Maybe you're right.
[770.85] There's no need for you to apologize
to her.
[773.56] She's hot headed just like her father.
[776.05] No, Sister-in-law, the fault is mine.
[779.10] Actually I forgot that Sabiha
is not the little girl that I raised.
[786.43] The thing is we forget.
[790.40] And we think the kids are always
going to remain kids but they grow up.
[796.68] I think maybe you don't
remember anything else either.
[799.82] Sabiha is not your daughter and
I am not your son.  We're not your kids!
[805.60] -Shut up, Sameer!
- Sameer!
[807.43] What?  I am telling the truth.
I think he's confused.
[813.22] You are not our father.
[824.87] Shameless!
[826.57] Your father is dead!
[828.81] This man has raised you!
[831.71] You're going to respect him.
do you understand?
[836.69] No, Sister-in-law.  Let it be, please.
[843.41] Child, your father...
[846.54] was my friend.
[849.39] Just like a brother.
[852.23] You're not my son, but...
[855.98] you're more dear to me than
my own children.
[858.95] Your brother, you friend, if he saw
you here, then what would he have thought?
[865.47] You're sitting on his chair
and having dinner with his family.
[869.85] You're raising his kids when he's not here.
[873.53] You're making decisions for his family
with his wife.
[878.50] what are you doing?  Playing the father?
[881.44] -The husband?
-Sameer, shut up!
[908.56] After Reaching Islamabad, both brothers were arrested
[912.11] and he was sent back to Jeddah
after a six hours.
[916.02] On the other hand,
[917.05] PPP leader Benazir Bhutto said
she'll participate in the elections again.
[925.11] And my solution is let's restore democracy.
[928.68] Let's mobilize the strength of the people, let
's go to the masses.
[932.02] Let's strengthen the people.
[934.97] Okay, your school's here.
[939.06] - Should I come with you and drop you off?
-No, I'll go.
[944.48] Sabiha,
[947.38] If you're not ready yet,
then we can go back home.
[954.73] There's no need to go.
Take a little more time.
[958.70] I spoke to your teacher.
She knows what happened.
[964.38] Uncle, we will start having to
restart our lives sooner or later.
[968.80] I can't just sit at home and cry.
[975.12] -Listen to me.
-Yes?
[978.69] If some kid at the school says something...
[982.38] then you're not going to react at all.
[986.52] I know you're angry.
[989.97] But...
[992.84] you won't fight at all.
[999.83] And you have my number.
[1002.94] You can call me whenever you want.  Is
everything right?
[1006.98] Go on, good.
[1044.59] Mom?
[1048.59] Mom!
[1052.00] Mom!  Sameer is crying.
[1058.54] Mom!  Sameer is crying.
Look at him at least.
[1063.54] Who's crying?
[1066.61] Sameer!
[1068.44] What if something happened?
Look at him at least.
[1079.82] Check why is he crying.
[1083.48] He must be hungry.
[1104.27] The kid was telling me that
she doesn't talk all day long.
[1109.40] You don't eat food and you
don't look after the baby at all.
[1114.62] Sabiha is scared all night long.
[1117.57] And on top of it all, she has to look
after the baby as well.
[1124.05] Physically, she's perfectly fine.
[1127.34] Psychologically, however, she doesn't
seem fine.  There are some outstanding issues.
[1131.22] Actually...
[1133.31] the last few months were very tough on her.
[1137.04] It could be an effect of that and most women
get depressed after giving birth anyway.
[1142.92] Anyway...
[1145.89] I'm prescribing some medicines
that will relax her, help her sleep.
[1152.65] It will reduce the depression too.  There'll
be drowsiness but she'll be fine otherwise.
[1158.14] And do take her out once a week.
[1181.18] Mom, have breakfast!
[1185.99] Mom!
[1198.96] Mom, have breakfast.
[1202.29] Mom!
[1206.24] Mom, what has happened to you?
[1269.65] Mom!
[1279.88] Mom!
[1297.48] Thank you very much.
[1307.12] Have a great weekend.
[1311.61] Sabiha.
[1313.49] Yes Sir?
[1315.40] Please stay for a bit.
[1324.05] You won't go home Friday after class.
[1328.01] We'll meet at the shooting range.
It's your one-on-one training.
[1332.64] Sir, one on one?
[1335.94] You, alone and the gun range.
[1339.21] This fear that you have regarding shooting.
[1342.25] We'll have to fix it, all right?
[1345.40] Sir, did you receive any instructions
from high above?
[1350.58] I'm your teacher.
[1353.02] It's my duty to train her.
[1356.18] You'll never pass out
if you're scared of the firing.
[1360.26] And I don't need any orders from above
to train my students.  Do you
[1366.63] understand?
[1368.91] Yes, Sir.
[1370.94] Friday.  Be ready.
[1421.36] Tell me.
[1423.60] what do you want to say?
[1430.00] I went to Aazo's school too.
[1432.87] Her teacher is also very concerned
about her.
[1437.62] Aazo never got such grades, man.
[1441.79] Yes.
[1444.38] Her teacher also said
that she had very withdrawn.
[1449.00] She doesn't talk a lot
with other kids either.
[1454.36] Ahsan...
[1456.86] - Are we the reason our daughter is--
- We?
[1462.26] This was your decision.
[1466.45] You always clap with two hands, Ahsan.
[1468.98] Sabiha, I was ready to do anything for Aiza
until the very end.
[1475.51] Anything!
[1477.69] To even be tied in a loveless,
passion less marriage.
[1482.09] But have you ever listened to anyone?
[1487.16] Ahsan, this is not about us.
[1491.40] This is about our daughter.
[1494.01] And whatever we have to do now,
we have to do it for Aiza.
[1496.91] So you took the responsibility, right?
[1500.17] You brought her here.
[1502.18] "I'll do the job
and I'll raise my daughter too."
[1504.95] You want to be a superwoman, right?
[1565.16] Ready?
[1568.47] I want results!
[1571.83] Aim!
[1575.77] Fire!
[1580.99] Look at the target then fire!
[1585.16] Again!
[1588.93] Fire!
[1598.45] Keep the target in the sight of the pistol.
[1603.27] Again!
[1609.29] Fire!
[1628.00] You didn't even hit one target.
[1632.26] I'm not talking to you as your uncle,
but as your boss.
[1637.49] If this goes on like this,
then you won't be able to pass out.
[1642.42] Look at me when I talk to you, cadet!
[1650.49] are you okay?
[1653.13] Yes, Sir.
[1656.42] You've started again.
[1660.01] This is a police academy!
[1662.83] Every cadet here is tested for drugs.
You know that, right?
[1667.58] You are the chief.
[1669.97] Do whatever you think is right.
[1672.97] Child... I'm worried about you.
[1676.59] Why don't you understand?
[1680.53] Is that all, Sir?
[1683.18] M...May I go?
[1685.66] Thank you, Sir.
[1724.08] I'm fine.
[1727.73] I'm always fine.
[1737.48] Everything I've seen,
the pain I've been through... I
[1742.57] can never let my daughter
go through the same pain.
[1748.71] I won't punish my daughter for my actions.
[1761.77] Mama!
[1771.10] Mama!
[1777.01] Mama, what happened?
[1783.91] Mom!
[1789.99] Mom!
