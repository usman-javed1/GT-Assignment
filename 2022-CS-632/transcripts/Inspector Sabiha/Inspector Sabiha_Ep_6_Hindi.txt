Come in. ASP Sabiha Shah,
the reason for this inquiry is the incident regarding the
investigation from 13th till 15th October. You're accused of unlawful use of power,
misconduct, and violation of police protocols. - Do you understand these charges?
- Yes, Sir. This is not a court.
This is just an internal investigation. But if the department felt the need
to file a case against you, then the evidence presented against
you here can be used in the court. - Do you understand?
- Sir. Abdul Rehman Zakir, aliases Rehman Lala. This man was on the Police's most wanted How did you get to him? I worked two years with Shakir Bhai.
(brother) When we found his dead body then
we found that he was a policeman. I couldn't believe it. Rehman Lala used to trust him a lot. - What did he do for Rehman?
- Whatever Lala asked him to. Smuggling shipments used to come,
he used to handle those. Picking up stuff from one place
and dropping it off at another. He would break people's legs sometimes
if the payments were due. Anything! And Shakir? Shakir bhai used to be with him too. He was a little educated
so Lala made him the in charge. Who killed Shakir? What can we say? I just heard that he got into a fight
with Rehman Lala. I don't know it was something
money related or what. I don't know anything. Where is Rehman? Why? Do you want to avenge your father? - Salam.
- Salam. I don't want revenge. I just need the truth. The truth is, Rehman Lala is lost despite being in front
of our eyes. No one can catch him. You know why? Because from a jailer to the minister;
everyone's in his pocket. I want to get to Rehman. And you'll take me. I can ruin your life with one order. How much of my life is even left, SP Madam. Cancer has eaten my entire body. There's nothing left for you. - Salam, Dad.
- Salam. - Salam.
- Salam. I can protect you. And your family too. But only on this condition
that you'll take me to Rehman yourself. Otherwise do remember one thing. No one will be more dangerous for you
than I am. I am thinking about my family. That's why I'm saying no. Because there are even more
dangerous animals than you in this jungle. You're gonna be well in a few days.
Are you feeling better now? What do you want to do after this?
What do you want to do? Bacha Party and go the water park. I gave her the medicines.
The pain is a lot better now. I'll leave now. I know your job timings are very odd. If you ever need me, call us. Thank you. How are you, my love? - Better?
- And pain? The pain's still there a little
but it's better. Aazo... Child, I'm sorry.
Mama leaves you again and again. But, my love... don't think that mama doesn't love you. I love you so much more than anything
in this world. I know, Mama. Nadia Auntie
says your mama is a police officer. She needs to keep everyone safe. Not just me.
So I understand and I'm very proud of you. ASP Sabiha. Madam, this is Ghazala. Ashraf's wife.  Yes, what is it? Can I meet you? Regarding Rehman. Sure, you can come to the office
whenever you want. Not at the office, Madam. It'll be an issue
if someone saw me there. Rehman's men are everywhere. Please do me a favor and come home. All right. - I'll come.
- Madam, hurry up. Time is really less. Okay. Come, Madam, come. Come, Madam. - Salam.
- Salam. Sit down, Madam. Rehman Lala is hiding in front of our eyes. But I'll take you to him. No one from your department should know
about this. Everyone protects him. Lala has everyone's secrets. If this got out, you won't be
safe and nor will I or my family. Rehman Lala's station... is surrounded by his
people on all four sides. The recognize me. They won't stop me. But you won't be able to go in the uniform. They'll kill you in the street. But I have a few stipulations. Stipulations? Tell me. My daughter... From today onwards,
my daughter is your responsibility. Her education, her future,
you'll look after it all. Promise me? Promise. You'll send my wife money every week. And one more important thing,
the most importance, that you'll have to do for me. Baji? (sister) Is everything all right? You look worried. Everything's fine. - Okay, listen.
- Yes, Baji? - I have to go out for some work.
- Yes. If Aazo wakes up after I leave,
tell her mama will be back soon. Okay, all right. - Take care of here.
- Yes, Sister. Go. I've made a lot of mistakes in life. Maybe I didn't do justice with you either. Forgive me for it if possible. Seeing you two together like this before... it used to fill me with rage. But I feel happy now. It's my heartfelt prayer that both of you
stay happy together like this. - Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine. I'll get busier with work
in the future maybe. Actually, I came to make a request to
the two of you that if I, for any reason, am not able to look after Aazo... Please always raise her as your daughter. Aazo is your daughter. And she'll always be your daughter. And if she ever needs us,
we're always here for her. I'm proud of what you've just said. I know, Sabiha. It takes a lot. But you know what? Love is something... that isn't lessened when you share it. It's only increases. And look... Aiza is so lucky, right? There are so many people that love her.
Right? Thank you. I'll leave now. I only came here to say this. What were you doing near
Rehman Zakir's camp with Ashraf? During the investigation Ashraf accept that not only does he know
about Abdur Rehman Zakir's spot, he can also show it to me. You asked and he agreed? What
were you giving him in return for this? He was a poor man, Sir. And sick too. Lung cancer. So agreed to do it
in exchange of a little money. According to eyewitnesses,
before the shootout, a woman clad in a burka was seen
with Ashraf Ali. But there's nothing
about her in your report. Sir, I didn't see any
woman clad in a burka there. I would've surely mentioned
her in my report had I seen her. Yes, Ashraf? You're still alive? There... You can call this life. Yes, Lala, I'm alive. Everybody has to die one day. Some with a bullet. Some because of cancer. And some of old age. Everybody has to die one day. Are you doing something these days? No, Lala. I can't even breathe
when I walk to the bathroom. How will I work? You never took care of me either. I gave my entire life to you. Why? Didn't you get the money? It's very clear with us, man.
Do you job and earn money. And the rest is charity to the mosque. Who is this? Is she your daughter? No. Then? She is Shakir Bhai's daughter. Not Shakir's. I'm Inspector Saeed Shah's daughter. The same eyes, the same attitude... I remember everything. What have you come here for? I've just come here to see... the man who killed me. The one who made my mother a widow
and me and my brother orphans. And why? Why? You don't go into the
lion's den to hunt it. You aim for it sitting afar. This is the only mistake Shakir made. His name was not Shakir. He was Shakir for me. I made him sit with me... I loved him more than brothers. And what did he do to me? He was cutting of my roots! What would I've done? I should've congratulated him
and sent him home? - He was performing his duty!
- I was also performing my duty It wasn't personal. You tortured him. You disrespected his dead body. So that it becomes an example... that what are the consequences
of cheating Rehman Lala. Anyway... what happened has happened. I could've punished his family for this too
if I wanted. But I didn't do it. What more do you want from me? A testimony? Testimony? A testimony for what? The testimony that my father
was a loyal police officer. And that he was performing his duty
and you killed him as a "shaheed". He was killed because of me. But I didn't make him a criminal
in the file. Go ask his uniformed brothers.
They made him a criminal. Go and ask them! Who? I need names. Who are you? You're sitting here in front of me
and ordering me around? I'm only tolerating all of this
because you're Shakir's daughter. If you spewed any more nonsense,
I'll throw you out of here! And you! Our accounts have been settled, understand?
Get out of here! Gogay! Throw both of them out of the neighborhood. And if you ever see them again,
just shoot them in the head. You didn't inform anyone in the department,
didn't take any back up. And you went there alone. Ashraf called me in the evening
on the way back home from work, that he wants to meet him. I thought he'd have to give me
some information, but I didn't know that Rehman's man were ready for an ambush. Go, get lost from here!
And don't show your face here again! How did the encounter start? When I reached the meeting point, so Ashraf
and Rehman's guard Ghazanfar aliases Gogi, they were already waiting for me. As soon as Ashraf saw me, he took
out his pistol and started shooting. Without a warrant, without any back up,
alone; why did you enter Rehman Zakir's building? Sir, a criminal fired a bullet
at a police officer. I was shot at from inside the building. And is this all a coincidence
that it was Rehman Lala's building... who was involved in the murder
of your father? Coincidence? No. Justice. And one more thing. The most important... thing that you'll have to do for me. If I come alive from there, then
everyone will know that I'm the informant. My death has already been written. But they won't spare my wife
and my daughter. I promise. No, no. Please don't kill me, don't kill me. My father must've said
the same thing to you. No, I didn't-- I didn't kill your father. - I didn't kill your father.
- Then who did? Who killed my father? I brought you into my home. I fed you from my plate. You still betrayed me. Look, Rehman, If you'll kill a policeman... then you won't be spared alive either. No. You don't worry about that. I've made all the arrangements for you. Don't you want to know? How did I find out about you? Come. Akbar. Akbar. Akbar! Akbar. If you won't be able to do it,
then let me know. Are you with me... Akbar! Akbar. Yes, come. Come. Come, come, come. Sa... Sabiha. Take care of Sabiha. You'll take care of her, right? Promise me. Promise me that... I'll take care of everyone. Sabiha, child, what am I hearing?
You did an amazing job! How did you find that imbecile?
I thought God knows where he'd be. You know what is
the devil's biggest strength? Lies, cheating. He's right in front of your eyes, but... you don't see him. There's no statement here from Rehman.
Did he not tell you anything? He told me. Rehman told me everything. But nothing's written in your report. The thing is, I... don't believe that much
in police reports now. And besides, what's the point of writing
the truth in them? Who'd know it better than you? What nonsense are you spewing? You're the one who's been spewing nonsense
all your life with me. Such a big lie? Such a big lie? I thought of you as my father
for my entire life and you-- You killed your friend? You made him guilty in his file
after killing him? What kind of a man are you? You snatched a husband from his wife,
and a father from his kids! - And then you got into that house--
- Then what could have I done? I told a thousand times to not go
on that path! Top to bottom, the entire police department
was involved in that. And him alone was out for "jihad". If Rehman would've gone,
all of us would've gone too! On one side, there was everyone.
And he was alone on the other! Idiot. He was the flag bearer for honesty. He was my brother. I loved him! And I killed him with my own two hands. I cry everyday remembering him. But he didn't leave me any choice! If he would've stayed,
then all of us would've died. Me, my wife, my kids! His wife, his kids! What about them? You ruined their life.
Did you ever even once think about that? I'm not an animal! I'm a human. I did whatever I could've done. For you, for your brother, for your mother. So that my hands get cleaned off his blood. And look at you. You're sitting
in front of me as an officer! I must've done something right. And the fire I've been
through to get here... what about that? Who's going to pay for that? And who's going to pay
for my mother's tears? I told you to not dig up old grievances! What if a truth comes out
that you won't be able to bear? That old grievance was my father! And you were the one who made him so! Look, Sabiha, child-- Don't you dare! Don't you dare
utter my name from your mouth! I'm the DIG. And you're the daughter
of a disgraced officer. No one will believe you. You career will be ruined. Madam, keep this pin. Twist it around
and it'll start recording. - It'll record everything?
- Yes, it'll record everything. No matter what you think of me... but I consider you like my own children
that's why I'm telling you. You can't the system alone. I told your father the same thing,
but he didn't listen. This system... is like a building. It has taken years to build this building. And everyone has a hand in this. Moving one brick... won't topple over this building. I think the voice didn't reach you. Or maybe you didn't hear it. Listen to it carefully. This building started to topple over the day my father refused
to become a part of it. So? How's everything going? Did your wounds heal? The wound is very deep. It'll take some time. ASP Sabiha Shah. Although a dangerous criminal was killed
due to your actions, and a breakthrough was made against
corrupt practices in the police department, but at the same time, police procedure
was violated because of your actions. And police department also gained
some bad reputation. There are some rules of the operation. There are some regulations,
but did not care for any of that. How much more time are you going to take
for your wounds? At some point,
you'll have move forward in life. I'm trying. Putting one foot ahead of the other. As a punishment for your misconduct,
for six months, you're being demoted to an Inspector
from an ASP. And since it seems that you
need to understand the procedure, that's why you're being posted
at the Malikabad Police Station. Go and learn something on the ground... how to work. Dismissed. Sir. Inspector Sabiha. Sir. If you ever need any warrant,
then you can directly call me. Sir. But now I feel that... the pain I always hid from everyone... they're now out in the open
in front of the whole world. Kintsugi. - Nabi Baksh?
- Yes, Madam? What is all this?
