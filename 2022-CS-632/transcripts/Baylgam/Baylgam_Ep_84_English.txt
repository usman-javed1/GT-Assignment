I don’t love you. Should I forcefully say that 
I love you? Leave it. After today, you and I will not have 
a relation with each other. I made a mistake that 
I helped you. It is all my fault. This is it. I am sorry, I cannot live with this burden, that’s why I am going. Look Afnan, don’t do this. Look, I love you and I have told mama
that I have come to meet you. I want to marry you. I love you, 
you love me. Just shut up. Hey, you said all this to your mother,
then it is not my fault. But I never told you that 
I love that I will marry you. I am telling you, after today, whatever relation you 
and I had is over. What do you think that I am not marrying you because 
I am busy with my work? Yes. Have you gone mad? Have you lost your mind? How did you even think 
that I will marry you? It is my fault. It is my fault, I shouldn’t have 
befriended you. But I had lost my mind. I thought she is an innocent girl, 
she gets herself in trouble, fine I will help her, but you… you are after my life. Hey, you had left your parents 
and come. You didn’t care about their respect, so how will you care for my respect? The one who couldn’t be true 
to her parents, she cannot be true to me either. You have no idea about the importance 
of relations, Ramsha. If you care for something it is you,
 yourself and your happiness. I don’t want to argue with you 
on anything. You can leave from here. I will not go. You will go. Not just from this room,
 but also from this home. Look… look Ramsha, already a lot of drama 
has happened between me and you. Right now everyone is sleeping, it is a good opportunity, 
leave from here quietly, no scene will be created. Once more… once more my guess about 
you turned out to be wrong. You know seeing this getup of yours,
for a moment, I thought you have changed, but no, you are the same person today. The same stubborn person who 
doesn’t listen to things easily. Yes, that’s how it is. I have changed. So it would be better that 
you leave from here. No need to say anything. Do as I say. Pack your bags, then go to dad, and tell him that you don’t want 
to live here. You will go to your home. Come on, give me the address 
for your home. What can liars and hypocrites like you
do apart from this. that’s it, you have spoken enough. These people are not making up 
these stories, you are. You are telling a false story 
like always. What was the need for you 
to do all this, Ramsha? I have had enough. There is 
no room for you in this home, get lost from here. If my father is not in this world,
then it is only cause of you. All this happened cause of you. When I see you, I get blood in my eyes. I feel that my father’s murderer
is standing. I want to kill you. I torture you the same way you 
tortured my father every moment and sent him from this world. I want to choke you to death. Mr. Afnan, stop interfering in the matters of my life. Let me live my life by my will. This will be a big favor you will do on me. I have no interest in interfering 
in the matters of your life. But when do you know 
how to live your life? When do you know how 
to take right decisions? If you had taken right decisions, then my father would have been
 alive today. You killed my father. Hey, had you lived your life properly, then today, you wouldn’t have been here, 
you would have been at your home. My father would have been alive today and I wouldn’t have hated you 
so much today. What is happening to me? I just wanted that I don’t see 
Ramsha’s face again. Why is my heart so restless now? Did you talk to your parents? Yes, sir, I spoke to my parents. They will come when you want 
to meet them. They live in Hyderabad. hmm.. and where do you live? Sir, you know this city is 
really expensive, and I shifted here some time back. Sir, I live here in Mehmoodabad. 
I share a flat with a friend of mine. Then where will Ramsha stay? 
Where will you keep her? Sir, I don’t have this much 
range right now, but still I will try that I get a 
small flat in this area. I am making your salary double and along with that I am getting you
an apartment as well. The apartment will be your own, you will have no worry and you will be able to spend 
the rent money somewhere else. Thank you so much, sir. 
Thank you. and you call your parents. Call them tomorrow, 
so that we can talk to them. Thank you sir, 
I will call them today. They will come to meet you. Look, I have told you everything 
about Ramsha. You also know she is divorced. Yes. I hope you have no objection on this. No sir, I have no objection on this. Everyone knows Mr. Qasim has 
made her, her daughter. Her joining with my fate will be 
something of pride for me. This girl should leave from this home 
today, instead of tomorrow. I just want that the war between you and 
Afnan should end. I don’t know what magic 
this girl has. The more you try to distance her 
from this home, she gets an even stronger footing. That’s what we have to think 
about now. What do you have to think? 
Who do you have to think about aunt? I was saying that obviously I am a mother, 
I am the elder, so I worry for my daughters. I was actually worried for Ramsha. I was taking about her, to her. If daughters go to their home, then my heart too will be at peace. Yes aunt, you are absolutely right. I have a boy in my office, Adeel. He is good, educated and decent. The issue is that he is from 
lower middle class, he lives in a rented apartment, 
so I am thinking about that. Why delay something good, Afnan? Aunt, his financial condition
 is not that good, we will have to do something. Afnan, you are doing so much 
for her already. After all, Ramsha belongs 
to a middle class family. Her exposure increased so much 
because of uncle and us. Alizay, maybe you are forgetting, 
if dad was alive today, he would have done much 
more than this for her. That is why it is my responsibility too. Listen to me. This is not your father’s car that you go around in this. The car belongs to you people, I just went to the academy. Don’t act so innocent. If brother has given you a place 
in this home out of sympathy, then this in no way means 
you are a family member. And these cars are for 
the family members, not for every other person. Uncle told me to go to the academy 
with the driver, that’s why I went with the driver. Hey even if brother has said it 
to you even as a formality then it doesn’t mean that you agree 
to everything he says. Have some shame, 
a person also says no. You are not a child that 
we tell you everything. Be careful in future. I had to go to the academy, 
I just went and checked, no driver is there. So, will you call that the driver comes. Ramsha, do you have a time for going 
to the academy or do you go to the academy 
at any time? The servants of the home are 
the servants of this home and not your personal assistants. Actually, there is a special lecture that is why I am going to the academy 
at this time, or else… Anyway, there is no driver, if you want to go, 
then you can go in a rickshaw and if you don’t have the money for 
the fare, then I will give it to you. Did you come on a bike? Yes. Then you should have asked 
your husband, at least he should have brought you 
in a taxi. Now see, you must have gotten used 
to traveling in big cars staying in this home. It would have been so difficult for you 
to come on a bike, you must be out of the habit too. Now just things that are of use for you, just because you are getting things for free, 
it doesn’t mean you get what you want. I had said no to uncle, 
he sent me with you forcefully. Yes, you are really naïve, 
he told you and you came. Right? I can see the way you are robbing 
my brother. Why did you stop? Stop these dramas, 
stop this crying. I don’t want to get anything, 
I want to go home. Come on. When you didn’t have to get anything,
then why did you bring me here? Stop these dramas of yours. If you go emptyhanded like this, then brother will feel that I have 
stopped you for getting anything. Get the things you need 
and come home. I don’t have time for these dramas 
of yours. Aunt. Go ahead. keep this credit card. Uncle gave it to me saying that if I ever need 
anything I can use it. Wow, brother even gave you credit cards. But he never mentioned it to me. Now you tell me, what other things did 
he bless you with? You know, you are really smart. You have brought 
the credit card to me, because it is out of balance. You would want that 
I put balance in it. But neither would I put balance in it, 
nor Afnan, because I am not brother. I don’t want anything like that. I don’t need balance in this. In fact, it still has the balance it had. I didn’t use it even once, you can get it checked if you want. You are not doing me a favour 
returning it. You must not need it anyway, because all of your wishes and desires
were being fulfilled in this home, so there is no point of keeping this. I needed uncle. Not this money. You keep it, maybe you will need it. Ill-mannered girl, I don’t know what she thinks of herself. What? Credit card? This means uncle must have 
given Ramsha a lot. Mama you find out from her. You are absolutely right. When brother can give her 
credit cards, then he must have surely kept 
his precious things with her. You know, brother had a lot. When sister in law,
passed away, there was a lot of jewelry 
of sister in law. But till today no one found out 
where it went. And even when you got married, 
brother didn’t give you a single set. I feel he kept all of this with Ramsha. You are absolutely right. First uncle spent his wealth on her, and now even Afnan is ready 
to spend it. You know what he was saying to me? He is talking about giving her 
a flat on the wedding. What?
Yes. Has Afnan lost his mind. I am surprised that even 
after so much happened, Afnan is giving this girl so much 
respect and a flat too. This is the limit. She is not single. He should marry her with simplicity
and send her off. That’s what I am trying to 
make him understand, but when does he listen to me. Alizay, the amount of effort we put in 
to drag this girl out of this home, I feel all that effort went to waste. You are right, mama. Now was it easy to defame Ramsha? We put so much effort 
in making her look bad. Don’t you remember how much money 
I spent to get her kidnapped. We took such a big risk. Mama, I feel that all our hard work 
will go to waste. All that you did will go to waste. Mama, I feel that someone was there. No one is there. No Alizay, no one is there. Did Afnan hear us talk. No Alizay, I just saw, 
Afnan is in his room. He is doing his office work.
No, I will still go and see. Come in. Sir Afnan.
Yes? I wanted to talk to you about 
something important. go ahead
I… Afnan, aunt Safia has called twice since morning, you please talk to her. Fine, I will do it. You tell me, what is the matter? Mr. Afnan, nothing. Nothing. What do you mean? You were just saying you wanted to 
talk about something important? Yes, I wanted an off. That’s all I wanted to talk about. How many days do you want off? One day. Fine, come back after one day.
 Leave. Fine. Tabssum, listen to me? What was the important thing 
you wanted to talk to Afnan about? I… I wanted an off. So you could have talked to mama 
or me about this. When have you asked Afnan
for an off earlier? I… I was cleaning downstairs so Mr. Afnan was sitting there, so I spoke him about an off. Okay. Fine. Leave. I will drag you out of the home, 
in front of the neighbours. You want this so I will do it. Why are you so merciless? If I don’t come to this home, 
where will I go? This is my home. You are my husband, 
I am your wife. You are dragging me out of my home. Look Shani, after so much happened, 
I still came back to this home, just for you. So that I can live my life with you. If you distance me from yourself,
then I will die… Don’t drive me mad.
I am telling you, you are making me so mad that I say something that you will not
be able to come to this home again. You don’t understand?
Get out of here. She is leaving. 
don’t say anything, please. Ramsha, come on. 
Come on, please. Have you forgotten your past? I knew it. I had an idea about 
you being a lowlife. Yes, I am lowlife. 
You recognized me well. And after marriage you will understand 
that I am not just a lowlife, but I am really cheap too. Because I remember every single thing. And I will take revenge for 
everything one by one. Your wedding gift. This is your wedding gift. I took you to the restaurant,
I fed you, I took you for an outing and you cannot
do something so small for me. It is simple, you will go their home tomorrow 
and bring money, okay? You have gone completely mad. Neither will I go to him, 
nor will I ask him for money, so you do what you want. This… Ramsha, I am telling you,
you are making me angry and you know how dangerous I am 
when I am angry. Shani, it hurts me and
you can do what you want, I will not be scared of threats.
Are you mad? Shani. Go inside.
What are you doing Shani? Have you gone mad? 
Open the door. Aunt. Aunt. Shani, son, did you find out something? 
Did you make arrangements for money? No, I got a no from the place I spoke at and papa has spoken at one 
or two places, but we don’t have a lot of hope 
from their either. Yes, obviously, there is so much inflation, 
who will give us a loan. People survive themselves, 
that is a big blessing. We are almost out of groceries, we will survive how we can. It is just a matter of a few days. But I am worried, I don’t understand what I am should do. Okay, I will bring food. I have never seen such bad times 
ever in my life. This has never happened in life. I don’t know, I am surrounded 
by worried all around, something weird is happening.
I don’t know what I have done. Brother, I want to say something. I hope you wont mind. The day Ramsha has left this home
and your life, happiness has left this home. At times, I am made to believe that we have really hurt Ramsha. Annie, what are you saying? That’s how it is. Ramsha was a really good girl. She had changed herself 
for the will of God. She became sincere to you,
she started loving you, but you didn’t care for her. This world is filled with karma, brother. If you get time, 
then do think about this. Madam Ramsha. What is wrong? Have you gone mad?
You scared me. Madam Ramsha, 
I had to tell you something. If you had to talk to me, then you should
have come to my room properly, what was the need to come to my room 
so secretly? Tell me, what happened? Actually…
Tabassum. Tabassum… Madam is calling you. Why? I don’t know that, but madam has said
that you come with me. Okay you go ahead,
I am coming. No madam said that you come with me.
Come on. Madam, you called me. Tabassum, you were asking 
for an off, right? I thought I would send you 
on a long leave. I don’t understand. There are a lot of servants in this home. And after all, after brother’s departure, there is not a lot of work. It is better that you find another job
for yourself. What are you saying, madam? I have worked at your place
for a long time, if I have made a mistake, 
then forgive me. This is your salary. Right now the month is not complete, there are still ten days to go, 
still I am giving you the full salary. But madam where will I get 
a job so soon? This is not my issue. I have not taken up your responsibility 
that I solve all your problems. Now go from here. And I know well how much 
you work here. What are you saying, madam? You think I don’t know all the things 
you have taken without my permission, but I know everything. It is my goodness that I didn’t say 
anything to you till today. Madam, all this is a lie, I have worked here really honestly. And I never took anything 
without your permission. Don’t argue with me. If I even see you near this home now, I will hand you over to the police. Now go from here. Thank God, mama. You handled this situation really well. Now, not just Ramsha, she will not even come 
close to this home. Thank God.
