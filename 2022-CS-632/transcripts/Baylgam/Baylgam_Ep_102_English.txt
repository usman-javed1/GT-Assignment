Look Afnan, I am saying all this to you because what will people 
think when they see this? Obviously, they will talk. After all, Shani is not 
just Ramsha’s cousin, he has been her 
ex-husband too. Look, people have already
 talked enough and I don’t want that people create an
 issue because of this girl. More than half the world 
knows your wife. Small things are blown 
out of proportions Afnan. Aunt, don’t worry,
 I will talk to Ramsha. No need to talk to her. Make her understand not to live up to her relationship
 with those people. The people who never
 supported her, neither love, nor acceptance. And that ill-mannered Shani, I don’t like that boy one bit. Have you forgotten him? Did you see his behavior
 after marriage? And he misbehaved 
so much with brother. You can forget these things, but not me, Afnan. You are an indifferent man, you will regret a lot. Get lost from here. I have no regret, understand? Come on, child. Get lost from here. Leave. I used to think that you 
are a smart man, but you turned out to be really stupid. You even forgot the benefit you can get 
out of living with Ramsha. What benefit will I get from her? Here you go. Keep it there. Did someone come today? Yes, aunt came over. Okay. Anyone else? No, no one else came. Aunt was telling me that Annie took admission somewhere, she is learning how to stitch, so she went there. Aunt came alone. Really? Do one thing, think once more. Did anyone else come with her? No Afnan, I told you aunt came. Why are you asking me 
again and again? Because you are lying to me. What do you think? I will not find out whatever
 is happening at home? I know well, even Shani came. Why did he come here? No, no, Afnan. There is nothing like that. Shani didn’t come here. Aunt was saying that Shani or uncle will come
 pick her up. It is possible that Shani would
 have to come pick her. I didn’t see him. He didn’t come in front of me. Hear me out clearly. I shouldn’t see Shani in this home or else I will not tolerate it. And tell everyone on 
that home as well. Rasheeda. Please make something good
 and spicy to eat today. I really want to have 
something spicy. Do you hear me? Make something really spicy. Don’t make tasteless, 
useless food, please. Yes, madam Alizay, I will try. Don’t try, you have to cook well. I don’t know what has 
happened to you, why have you suddenly started
 to make such tasteless food? What happened? Why are you so worried? Madam Ramsha, you know
 madam Alizay’s anger. Since she has become pregnant, her anger has increased. Now she wants to have
 something spicy, that too with good taste. I try my best to make 
something good for her, but she doesn’t like it. Look, the condition 
she is in right now, in it, the taste changes. Okay tell  me, what does she want to have? I will cook it. You have made it easy for me. Come on, I will tell you what needs to be made. Come on. Listen, you cooked really good food today. I really liked the biryani. Yes, honestly. The minced meat and 
kebabs were really delicious. Sister, I didn’t cook food today, madam Ramsha did. Madam Alizay wanted to have 
something spicy today, so madam Ramsha said, she will prepare it. 
Whatever was cooked, was made by madam Ramsha. She cooked the food today 
with a lot of effort. What is the effort in this? After all, I am free all day long. If I went into the kitchen for 
a little while, then what is the big deal in it, huh? Yes, true. After all, Ramsha has nothing to do. You did good that you took care of the work in the kitchen. Aunt, by the way, since Alizay took an off from her office, even Alizay has nothing to do. But the difference between 
Ramsha and Alizay is that Ramsha takes care of everyone. This is her love for all of us that she cared about Alizay’s feelings. She cooked the food she wanted to have. You two should have at 
least thanked Ramsha, but no issues, I will do it. Thank you, Ramsha. Thank you so much. Annie is calling. Hello Annie, how are you? What happened Annie? 
Why are you crying? What? Uncle had an accident. Okay. Okay, stop crying Annie. I am coming. I am coming. Stop crying. I am telling you I am coming. Okay. Hey. I am so sorry aunt. I am so sorry. Watch where you are going. Where are you going
 in such a hurry? Where are you going? Uncle had an accident, Annie called. I have been calling Afnan for so long, but he is not answering, so I am going myself. Aunt, as soon as Afnan, you tell him I went to uncle’s home. Yes, yes, I will tell him. Aunt, please tell him or else he will worry. Obviously, what is there to forget in this, you go without worrying. Okay fine. Thank you. Bye. Aunt, how are you talking to my aunt? Now you will tell me what I should say to someone? The guests who come to the home of cultured people are respectable. You don’t insult them. Ramsha, hear one thing clearly, no relative of yours will come to my home now. Why? I am Afnan’s wife. I have a full right on this home, so my relatives will
 surely come here. Aunt, you come with me. Hey, Ramsha, child, you are worried for no reason. I had a minor accident. That’s why I had told you not to call Ramsha, she would get worried. Why did Annie call her? I really got worried hearing 
about your accident. I couldn’t understand what
 I should said. So I told Annie to call Ramsha, so she called Ramsha. Thank God, the bone didn’t break or else we would have had to 
get an operation done. Thank God. He has been kind. Should I make porridge for you?
 You should eat porridge. You know honestly, the porridge Ramsha makes, no one else can make it. You mother and daughter 
don’t have the taste... ... that Ramsha has in her hands. She has the same taste 
as sister in law. You are right about that. Sister in law knew how
 to make everything so well and Ramsha has
 learned everything from her. Uncle, I will make porridge for you. Hey, Ramsha, child. I didn’t mean that at all. Leave it. You have come tired. You still have to go back home. I am not tired at all. I will go make porridge for you, after that I will go home. Okay. I will go make it. She is such an affectionate child, she has always cared a lot for us. We were unworthy, we didn’t realize her worth or else our Ramsha would have been living 
with us in this home. I will go check, she must be working 
alone in the kitchen. Ramsha. How dare you? You dared to come back to this home. Get out of here. Get out. You are dead for us. What are you saying? I am absolutely right sister in law. The consequence of what ... she has done is that we 
take her life right now. Don’t say that. Uncle, you can kill me, but I will not go anywhere from here. Ramsha did you not hear what I said? Get out. Get out of here. Uncle, please listen… Don’t. Don’t call me your uncle. I am dead for you. That… Papa. Papa. Uncle, papa... Shameless girl. Because of you… because of you my father like brother has 
left me and gone. Because of you. You are a murderer. You are your father’s murderer. I shouldn’t see you here. Take her from here. Take her. One minute. Anwar, you be quiet. This is not the time to say these things. I said, I don’t want to see her here. Get lost. Take her from here. Child, go inside. Ramsha, go inside, child. Come on. A disobedient child has no right to see the face of their dead father. Take her inside. Take her. No. No, no, uncle, don’t torment me like this. Let me see my father’s face. All of you know how much papa used to love me. When everyone rejected me, that’s when my father hugged me. No one can stop me from 
seeing my father’s face. She is committing a sin. Stop it. People are watching. She is committing a sin. Be patient. After that she is arguing with me. She killed my brother. She is a sinner. Papa, please. Ramsha. Are you still upset with me? Why? We don’t have a relation that you ask me if I am upset
 and you convince me. Whatever I did with you was wrong. Oh wow, it is good that you realized it. Did you not realize it soon, Shani? But you know, now this realization is 
of no use for you, nor is it of any use for me. That’s why it is better that you bury this realization inside you. I regret losing you. You know Shani, when you don’t realize on time, then just like that, this realization becomes regret and sorrow. You are absolutely right. But despite that if possible,
 please forgive me. I am embarrassed. What is the point of this 
embarrassment, Shani? Why were you not 
embarrassed at the time when you tortured me
 every moment? Why were you not embarrassed when you made fun of 
my helplessness? You even snatched the roof 
from over my head. Along with your life, you dragged me out of this home too, why were not embarrassed then? I forgive you, Shani. I didn’t forgive you because my heart became soft, in fact, I forgave you because I don’t want to keep any relation
 with a man like you. Neither hatred, nor revenge. Brother has done something cheap, he shouldn’t have taken the money… You cannot keep a secret, right? I had told you not to tell anyone . Don’t you understand? You should be ashamed brother. You have lost your mind so much 
in your craze to go out that you don’t care about 
your respect and honor. I want to live with you. Both of us will go there 
and start a new life. Only you and I will be in that life. No third person will be there. We will leave behind all the bitterness
 and regrets of our past here. We will start a new life. I want to live with you. I want to live my life with you, Shani. Ramsha, have you gone mad that I take you to Dubai with me? I cannot tolerate you here. I don’t want to see your face, this is why I want to go to Dubai and you are saying that 
I take you along with me? Stop. If you want that I drag you out of the house in front of the neighbours, then I will do that. Why are you so merciless? If I don’t come to this home, then where will I go, Shani? This is my home. You are my husband, I am your wife. You are dragging me out of my home. Look Shani, even after so much happened, I came back to this home, only for you. So that I can live my life with you. If you distance me from yourself, then I will die. Don’t drive me mad. I am telling you, you are making me so 
angry right now, I will say something that you will not be able to come 
to this home in future.
