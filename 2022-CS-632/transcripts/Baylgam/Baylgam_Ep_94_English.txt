Ramsha, how are you here?
Afnan, Afnan how are you?
Are you well? Where did you get hurt? Afnan, how, how did this all happen?
Afnan you… I am absolutely fine,
I met an accident Ramsha, I am sorry I didn’t have
my phone on me So I couldn’t tell you but how come
you are here and all this? I feel sad about myself, you went through so much difficulty
and came here to meet me and I, I couldn’t even inform you
about this, I know you love me a lot
but I am absolutely fine, I am absolutely fine, nothing
has happened to me, it’s just a matter of few days, everything will be back to normal
like before, you just go from here. No, no, no, I won’t go anywhere
from here, Afnan, I can’t leave you and go anywhere, I will stay close to you and
take care of you and all this has happened
because of me anyway, Afnan. How has this all happned
because of you? I gave you somuch tension and
because of me you met an accident. I want to live near you. Ramsha, don’t hold yourself
responsible, nothing has happened to me,
I am absolutely fine. Everything will be like before
in a few days. You are the one who says, there is always God’s expedience
in everything. So then there must be expedience
of God that I am here. Don’t push me away from you, Afnan, let me stay near you,
please Afnan. Okay why are you crying.
Afnan, careful. it’s nothing, nothing, nothing. Afnan, careful, what are you doing?
Why are you crying? I am saying everything is fine, I am absolutely fine,
this is a minor injury, doctor has just made me wear this
for no reason. You must go, it won’t be good
if someone sees you here right now. I won’t go anywhere from here, I will stay with you and
take care of you, and by the way I am your wife, I have right on you, you can’t take away my right from me,
Afnan, don’t ask me to go away from you,
I won’t go anywhere. Okay, I am not taking
any right away from you. I promised you, I will get you your honor and
I will do that anyhow. I won’t break my promise. Just stay strong for a few days, everything will be fine,
stop crying, you know I cannot tolerate you crying. You made the soup yourself? Yes. it must be very bad. Afnan. Try it. Shall I feed you? Not bad. All your prayers get answered right? So I was thinking if you can
pray for me too? Whenever I pray
I always pray for you. Yes but there is one prayer that
I especially want you to make. What? That May God take away
all my difficulties. Always keep our companionship intact and remove all the problems. Stay here today. Ramsha I cannot stay today. Alizey’s condition is not well. I cannot leave her alone
in this condition. If things were normal I would have
stayed but… But what? But I want Alizey to stay happy till
our child comes in this world. No problem Afnan, I guess it was in our fate
to meet like this. Madam Ramsha, 
you are my younger sister and seeing you in this condition makes me
 really sad. I wish I could do something for you. You have done a lot for me 
brother Jamshed. Thank you very much. I will be thankful to you all my life. Don’t say that madam Ramsha, 
you are embarrassing me. And can I say something to you? Mr. Afnan is really very lucky that 
he got a wife like you. Not everyone gets a wife who stands with 
you in every condition and compromises. May God keep you really happy. Amen. Thank you. Brother Jamshed, you just have 
to get me Afnan’s home on time. The time Rasheeda comes, then. Yes, sure. I will go now. Listen, girl. Why are you taking food 
into Afnan’s room? Where is Rasheeda? That… I am asking you something. She is serving food on the table… Okay, she is serving my lunch 
on the table. Tell me, did Alizay have breakfast? Afnan. Where were you? I have been 
waiting for so long. I was coming, you know, aunt stopped me
 on the way. Okay then? Is everything fine? Yes, everything is fine. Thank God. 
Nothing to worry about. I got biryani, you start eating. How can I eat? You will feed me. I feed you? Yes. I want that my wife feeds me food 
with her own hands. Feed me. Afnan, someone will see us. Who will see? There is no one at home. Alizay has gone to the office, 
she will come late. Aunt doesn’t come downstairs, 
so no one can see us. Come on, I am unwell. I am asking you to feed me, 
so feed me. Okay fine. Okay tell me, when are you 
coming back home? Hey, Alizay, you came early today from the office.
 Are you feeling okay? Mama, I was just a little unwell, so I thought I would come back
 early today. You did good. Go and rest a little. Alizay. Hey, you are here. I mean. How did you suddenly come? Actually, I didn’t feel well 
in office today, so I thought I would come early today. Why? Did you not like it? No. No. Why would I not like it? What is so surprising in this? Actually, you don’t come so early 
from the office, that’s why. By the way, you look more worried 
to me than surprised, why? Is everything fine? Yes. Yes. Everything is fine. You are feeling it for no reason. I am not worried at all. I was just thinking that 
if you are not feeling well, you should have visited the doctor 
on your way back. No, I feel I need to rest. I am very tired. I will go change, then 
I will sleep for a while. Did you give flowers to Ramsha? Yes. No, one minute Afnan, I don’t understand. Earlier, you couldn’t tolerate that girl. You didn’t want to see her face. Now suddenly you sympathize 
with her so much that you are bringing her flowers. Look Alizay, now I don’t understand 
what your actual problem is. Do you have a problem that
 I gave her flowers or that I said thank you to her? I didn’t like both the things, Afnan. Even if that girl took care of uncle, 
she didn’t do us any favors. Shameless girl. Are you not ashamed? How can you deceive us like this? What did I do?
What happened to you? You come and talk to me. What has happened to me? 
Yes, yes, you will come to save your lover. What did you think? You two will continue to fool me 
and I will tolerate it. I will not find out anything? Fahad told me everything honestly. You found my husband in the entire world
to have an affair. Alizay, what are you saying? There is nothing like that. 
Please be quiet. Don’t create a scene. 
I am not creating a scene, you have created a scene out of me. You have made a scene out of 
in front of the whole world. One minute, Afnan. 
Yes? What is this? 
What? How did you get dirt on your coat? Actually…
I will tell you. Ramsha put this dirt, right? 
I saw it on her hands. No, no, you are taking it wrong. 
You have a misunderstanding. I am not taking anything wrong, Afnan. I couldn’t even imagine 
you could call fall so low. You people have crossed all limits. What nonsense is this? I am not talking nonsense.
I am speaking the truth. You are spending time with 
that cheap girl leaving you wife. Shut up. Just, shut up. I think I shouldn’t have come here, 
Afnan. Yes, maybe you are right. You worry coming here 
for no reason. You shouldn’t take so much stress. After all, I am fine now. I will come to meet you daily. What happened? What are you thinking? I am thinking that if Alizay has 
seen me in this home, then? She didn’t see you right? So why are you worried on this 
without any reason? Will you answer me. What? I want that you tell everyone 
about your marriage with me. Afnan, just like everyone respects 
Alizay as your wife, I too want that respect. You are my wife, this is a truth, it is a reality. You too will get the same position 
and place that Alizay has. Just give me some time. And trust me in this time, 
have faith. The relationship I had dreamed
 of with you at one time. My God will fulfill in a few moments. I couldn’t even imagine Afnan, that you would become my destiny. Hey, then why are you crying? This is not the time to cry. I am not crying. These are tears of happiness. I had a lot of important meetings, 
but I said no, first I will go meet my Ramsha, then we will decide something. Hey, what are you doing? No. What is wrong, Afnan? I don’t like that you touch 
my shoes like this. Really? But I will really like 
if I do all your work. You know Afnan, I really wanted to do all your work. After all, I am your wife and you have 
the most right on me. What are you looking like that? I was thinking how much difference 
is there between you and Alizay. I am disappointed at myself. You got into so much difficulty and 
came to meet me here, and I… I couldn’t even inform you about this. I know you love me a lot. 
But I am absolutely fine. I am absolutely fine. It is just a matter
 of a few days, everything will be like earlier. 
That’s why you go from here. No. No. No. I cannot leave you 
and go anywhere, Afnan. I will stay with you. 
I will take care of you. And after all, all this happened 
cause of me. How did all this happen 
cause of me? Look, I worried you so much, 
I gave you so much tension and you had an accident cause of me. I want to stay with you. Ramsha, don’t blame yourself. Nothing happened to me, 
I am absolutely fine. In a few days everything will be 
like before. Everything will be fine. 
Stop crying. You know, I cannot tolerate you crying. Did you make this soup yourself? Yes. It must be really bad. You drink it and try. Should I feed you? Not bad. I want that my wife feeds me food 
with her own hands. Feed me. Afnan, someone will see us. Who will see? 
There is no one at home. Alizay has gone to the office, 
she will come late. Aunt doesn’t come downstairs, 
so no one can see us. Come on, I am unwell. I am asking you to feed me, 
so feed me. Okay fine. Okay tell me, when are you
coming back home? That’s it, enough driving. Hey, does anyone drive like this? I mean, you would have just gotten me
killed along with you. You are laughing. Why are you so scared?
Were you not scared? When you are with me, 
then why should I be scared? You know when you are with me,
I don’t fear anything. I feel I am the safest in the world. And when you are with me, my life changes. Hey, hey, what are you doing? You trying to fix your scarf will get 
a cloth on my face, I will die. Afnan, don’t say this again. Okay, I won’t. Shall we go?
Come on. Ramsha. Ramsha, I talk to you with love 
again and again and you start driving the fast. 
Ramsha, please…. Fine. Okay. Okay. 
Okay, Afnan. Okay listen to me. Yes?
I have kept all the food here. Yes. 
Serve it on the table. And put the kebabs 
that I took out, put them in a plate and 
place them on the table. I am going to get ready or else Afnan will say I am always 
dressed like a maid.
