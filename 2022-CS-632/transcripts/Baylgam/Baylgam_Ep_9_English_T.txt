[25.44] Send Mr Liaquat to me.
[34.44] Yes Sir?
[35.64] What is this?
[37.64] What is this? 
I cannot accept this thing at all.
[41.24] I asked you to lay off some staff
 from here
[44.12] and you have brought me the file 
for their increment.
[47.00] Take it back, I won’t sign this.
[48.76] Sir this is not workers’ demand, in fact, 
these are the orders from Mr Qasim,
[52.96] In the last meeting he ordered to 
give increments to workers.
[62.08] Dad is…
[63.84] okay leave the file, I will look into it.
[68.80] Right sir.
[79.40] I don’t know,
[81.48] I don’t know when will dad listen to me.
[94.00] This is with it? 
Hmm.
[96.76] uncle,
[99.44] help me a little, I am confused 
which jewelry set to choose.
[103.12] My child, I don’t know 
about these things,
[106.24] you must ask Afnan, in fact, 
decide it yourself.
[109.16] Just let it be, uncle, 
what shall I ask Afnan?
[112.16] He has no interest in all these.
[114.56] Whenever I ask him he tells me that everything 
looks good on you and buy all of them.
[119.24] So he is right, 
our daughter is so beautiful,
[121.80] whatever she will wear would look nice.
[124.76] Thank you so much, uncle.
[128.68] Mom, how does this set look?
[132.80] I like both of them, 
but this one looks prettier.
[135.64] This is prettier?
Yes it is.
[137.16] Then let’s finalize this one.
[139.36] Thank God, at least you liked something
[141.84] but if you want anything else 
you can let me know I will bring it.
[144.96] And it will be best if you accompany me 
to the jeweler yourself.
[149.56] Mom, you know how I am busy
 because of office?
[154.36] I wouldn’t have time.
[155.84] I have done these little bits of preparations 
with so much difficulty.
[158.84] Greetings.
[160.52] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[162.24] Peace be upon you and 
God's mercy and blessings.
[163.64] Is everything okay? How come 
you are here at this time?
[165.80] Dad, everything is fine,
[167.56] I just wanted to discuss 
something with you.
[169.64] You sent Mr Ahmed to me
[172.48] yes, did you sign the notice then?
[175.00] No dad, umm
[177.96] that is what I am saying, 
I wanted to discuss it with you.
[186.20] Dad,
[188.48] dad, we always listen to you,
[192.52] umm,
[194.12] now recently you have just announced 
bonuses for all the employees,
[199.96] everyone has medical insurance,
[202.80] all the other expenses are pretty much 
covered by the company as well.
[207.72] So then this increment 
in salaries all of a sudden?
[212.08] I didn’t quite understand it,
 dad and by the way,
[214.72] who does so much these days?
[217.72] Hmm.
[219.68] That’s a nice question,
[222.32] who does this?
[225.72] My son, our great Prophet Mohammad (PBUH)
 used to do it.
[237.76] His Follower Scholar Rizwan Ullahi 
Tala Majmaeen used to do it
[241.52] and we all should do it.
[246.72] He would create ease and 
facilities for his workers.
[257.16] And facilitating your employees,
[261.32] and creating ease for them is 
Sunnah of our Prophet (PBUH).
[269.52] Dad, dad, you are taking me wrong,
[272.24] I didn’t mean to say that at all,
[275.36] look dad, I am just trying to say 
that you are already doing a lot,
[279.68] employees do not get such relief
in any company
[286.08] but after this,
[289.52] employees are going to get spoiled
[291.24] and they will expect increment 
and bonuses every year.
[295.44] I know there has been inflation dad,
[297.08] but it’s not just employees 
who are suffering from inflation,
[299.28] the company has been suffering too and 
our budget has been going over-sized.
[302.92] Hey Afnan, just make intentions first,
[305.28] God will create ways for you.
[308.08] Now look we are having this small ceremony
 in our home,
[311.84] we are making so many arrangements for it,
 we are sending so much,
[314.00] we are not thinking about it,
[315.76] we are not having any thoughts 
about this expenditure
[318.36] then if we are facilitating and creating ease 
for our employees to pleasure God,
[325.48] then just consider it charity, 
He will bless us.
[328.76] But dad, I… 
I don’t want to argue, son,
[332.36] I just want you to think about it 
and feel what I am saying.
[393.16] I have gotten the permission 
after so much difficulty,
[394.92] dad spoke on my behalf only 
then did Mom allow me.
[400.16] What the hell? 
Give me my phone.
[401.80] What? I am telling you that I have gotten 
the permission with so much difficulty
[404.12] and you’re busy in your phone?
[408.28] Dude, Afnan is not taking 
my call since yesterday.
[412.68] I don’t know where he is busy, 
I have called him and messaged him too
[415.64] but he is not responding at all.
[417.36] To hell with Afnan.
[421.72] Tell me,
[422.96] shall I wear my black maxi?
[425.56] Brother! For God’s sake,
[427.48] don’t wear that old maxi again,
[429.56] you look so bad, 
you can’t even imagine.
[434.76] At least sometimes you can say 
good about someone.
[436.80] You just say everything on face.
[438.48] Because that is how I am, 
that’s why.
[441.40] Okay, Mom has asked me 
to come back soon,
[443.92] so ask Alizey what are the timings 
of the arrival of the groom,
[445.76] we will plan accordingly.
[447.48] She was saying that her in laws 
will come early,
[450.24] that is why we have to go early too 
and come back early as well.
[454.12] Thank God that mom has 
spoken to Alizey’s mom
[457.40] that is why we peacefully got 
the permission to go.
[459.52] Thank God that Alizey’s mom 
spoke to aunt,
[462.40] now aunt will talk to mom and 
mom won’t bother us.
[466.28] Now tell me what to wear.
[468.36] Let me do one thing,
[469.68] let me get you some good clothes
from my cupboard,
[471.80] wear them, don’t wear your own, please.
[474.04] Give me my phone.
[485.76] yes,
[487.64] No Mr Zahid, I am emailing it 
to you right now.
[490.20] Okay, okay.
[494.80] Oh God!
[496.20] Tell your office people to spare you 
at least today.
[499.20] Mom, I just have to sent 
an urgent email,
[501.92] just wait for 2 minutes.
[503.64] Alizey, put your phone down, please.
[506.36] Mom, just…
[508.88] Alizey,
[510.20] let’s go to the bridal room, you have 
to freshen up your makeup as well.
[513.16] Mom, I am almost done, 
just wait a minute.
[516.28] It is an important work, let me..
[518.08] I am asking you to keep your phone down,
 we are getting late.
[521.84] Let’s go.
[523.08] Shut off this problem and let’s go.
[533.28] Mr Liaquat, just make sure that there is
no mismanagement here at all.
[537.44] Don’t worry, sir, 
everything will be managed.
[539.48] Great, umm, there shouldn’t be 
any complaint.
[544.00] Okay.
[544.68] And properly receive all the guests 
and bring them straight to the hall.
[548.28] Right sir.
[549.12] Please make sure all the guests 
get their proper protocol.
[552.56] Don’t worry at all sir, 
it will be done exactly that way,
[554.08] Thank you.
[557.48] You look so handsome by the grace of God, 
Afnan.
[561.36] You don’t look any less beautiful. 
You are looking really nice.
[564.16] Thank you.
[565.16] It’s good you got ready in time, 
brother is calling you.
[568.48] Okay, tell him there are a 
few chores here and there,
[570.48] I am going to finish them and come. 
Okay.
[571.84] Aunt?
[574.52] Has Alizey gotten ready?
[578.04] Hmmm, you are so concerned about Alizey?
[580.32] No, it’s not that,
[582.80] I will always be concerned for her
[584.80] but I know she takes proper time 
in getting ready,
[588.52] I want today’s event to start in time
[591.52] and guests doesn’t have to wait.
[592.96] And you know dad pretty well,
[594.88] he is very punctual and disciplined, 
he will get upset.
[598.12] Just don’t worry at all,
[599.96] she is absolutely ready and
looks really beautiful.
[602.64] She is sitting in the bridal room.
[604.52] You go meet brother, okay?
Okay.
[611.24] Umm, Afnan sir,
[613.52] please come and check 
the food arrangement.
[617.12] Come, let’s go.
[622.08] Salma, that Shiza from the morning show,
[624.76] did you see her program today?
[626.96] Oh God! She was wearing 
such beautiful clothes.
[628.92] Shiza? 
Greetings.
[630.24] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[632.60] How are you son?
[633.60] Where is Annie?
[635.04] Why is there so much silence at home?
[637.12] Umm, both of them has gone to a 
friend’s house for her wedding.
[641.04] In a friend’s wedding? 
Whose wedding?
[644.16] Her friend Aliza, 
they have gone to her wedding.
[649.52] And they have gone alone?
[651.40] Hey, no, no, son,
[653.68] your uncle went to drop them
[656.08] and they will come back with their friends,
[658.72] their friends live here only, they are from
the same neighborhood,
[661.72] they will come with them.
[664.48] You guys have let them go alone,
[666.88] I mean, someone should have 
gone with them
[670.20] Hey, your aunt is telling that 
your uncle has dropped them,
[675.44] why are you worried?
[677.20] Uncle has dropped them,
[679.44] he hasn’t gone to the function with them,
[681.12] both of them are alone in the function.
[682.96] Shani, there 2 3 friends have 
gone along too,
[685.60] they all will be together, why are you 
getting so worried?
[688.84] Mom, I have told you a lot of time 
before as well that I don’t like
[691.64] that you allow Annie to go like this.
[693.12] okay my child, I will be careful next time,
don’t worry,
[696.52] I won’t let Annie go anywhere alone.
[699.12] No, let me go check on them, 
I am not hungry.
[702.88] By the way, sister in law, 
Shani is right,
[706.80] one of us should have gone 
with the girls.
[710.04] You are absolutely right Salma,
[712.68] but you know then I thought that 
we don’t know anyone there,
[716.36] what will we do at the wedding there
[718.40] and yes, I have spoken to Alizey’s mom,
[721.28] she was saying that the function 
will end very early,
[724.52] girls will come back home early.
[727.24] Thank you, sister in law that 
you took brother Sajid’s name,
[731.88] if you would have said that 
girls are going alone,
[734.84] he would have been so upset, 
he would have gotten really mad.
[736.84] Salma, I am not that fool.
[742.56] I just hope they come soon.
[746.40] That’s it, that’s it.
[749.00] Come, Annie, hurry up.
[752.84] Quickly give me Rs500.
[754.72] Why 500, sister? It will be Rs700.
[757.28] Why brother? We decided Rs500
[759.04] and I said I will get dropped
in front of the banquet,
[760.96] I can’t get off on the road.
[762.00] Sister, you said you wanted to get dropped 
on the roundabout,
[764.08] and then you have brought me inside here.
[765.48] I will charge at least Rs200 more.
[767.12] What is wrong with you?
[768.60] Okay I understand that it is supposed to be 
Rs200 from the Defence turning till here
[771.72] but that doesn’t mean that 
your Rs200 petrol has been used.
[775.00] Have some shame, you are lying.
[777.36] Sister, there is petrol then oil,
[779.56] it also takes mantainance.
What will I take home?
[781.64] Sister at least give Rs100 more.
[783.08] That’s it, give him Rs50 more,
[784.72] if you want them keep it else, 
we are leaving.
[786.68] Sister, I am a poor man. 
Hey enough now.
[788.40] Just take these Rs600 and go.
[790.76] Ramsha, will waste all the time here? 
Won’t you go inside?
[792.96] He has already brought us here 
at the slowest speed. Let’s go inside.
[802.36] Excuse me? 
Yes?
[803.36] This is Alizey’s function, right? 
Yes, ma’am.
[805.36] Thank you.
[810.12] Wow Ramsha,
[812.96] Alizey’s family has done such 
an amazing set up.
[818.04] Look at the banquet.
[819.48] By the way, Alizey’s family doesn’t have that 
much money as they have spent on this wedding.
[824.72] You are such a fool.
[827.28] How will Alizey’s family do all this?
[829.76] Her in laws are very rich people,
[832.40] they have done all this
[834.04] and you know they man Alizey is getting 
married to has come from Dubai.
[838.92] Now this all was to be done by them.
[842.16] True that.
[844.56] By the way listen,
[846.32] there are no guests yet,
[850.20] and look the hall is so amazing,
[851.80] the stage is so pretty,
 let’s make videos, come.
[855.16] Are you mad? It will look 
very strange Ramsha.
[857.32] Annie, you have a lot of problems 
with everything.
[860.20] Come let’s go there. 
I will go sit on stage,
[862.16] make a nice video of me.
[863.56] Come on, now hurry up.
[866.16] I will sit here, you just stand here 
and make my video.
[868.96] Hold this, hold this.
Okay. Quickly.
[873.48] Shall I come up, or from here?
No, no, that’s it. we will start at 3 2 1.
[875.64] Okay. 
ready?
[876.88] Yes. 
Is everything fine?
[878.48] Yes. 
Come on. Ready.
[881.36] 1 2 3.
[901.88] Move a bit there, 
move a bit there.
[903.88] What are you girls doing?
[906.20] Come down.
[907.12] Excuse me? What do you mean 
by what are we doing?
[909.40] We are making a video.
[910.80] Is there any restriction of 
using phone here?
[914.52] You tell me who are you and 
what are you doing here?
[917.20] Oh hello! Talk nicely.
[919.52] What do you think are we lying?
[921.56] It’s not that, it is Alizey’s wedding and 
Alizey is our best friend, understand?
[926.20] You are Alizey’s friend?
[931.32] Why are all of them looking at us like this?
[937.76] I told you not to make any video here.
[940.76] You don’t even listen to anyone. 
Shut up.
[943.16] Why shouldn’t I make a video?
[944.64] This is not some classroom 
where a sir will come
[946.68] and ask what is going on and 
we will be scared.
[948.60] It is a wedding hall and we will take pictures
and videos here.
[953.88] Greetings madam. 
Yes Mr Liaquat? What is it?
[957.68] Don’t worry, 
they will talk to Alizey
[959.44] and everything will get fine then, 
he is just being over for no reason.
[961.28] Ma’am, some of your friends are here, 
they want to talk to you.
[964.44] Here, talk to them.
[966.88] Hello?
[967.96] Yes Alizey?
[969.12] Who are these people in your wedding?
[970.96] They are asking strange questions.
[972.48] They are saying why are you 
making videos and pictures here,
[974.72] they think we are lying. Tell him 
we are your best friends.
[978.20] Tell him, tell him.
[979.52] Yes, tell me, who is it?
[981.28] what is your name?
[985.80] Alizey?
[988.76] This doesn’t sound like Alizey’s voice.
[1014.08] Brother where were you 
I was calling you for so long,
[1018.28] your phone was switched off.
[1019.72] I went for prayers, you know 
I switch off my phone.
[1023.04] I asked Afnan to distribute the food 
of this event in Darul Uloom
[1028.24] and to Orphans and needy kids, 
where is Afnan?
[1032.16] Yes brother, Afnan told me,
[1035.16] let the event get over I will send 
the leftover food then.
[1039.12] Oh God! Forgive me.
[1042.28] This is our problem,
[1044.04] we give the leftover food 
in the way of God.
[1047.72] What is wrong?
[1048.88] There is unlimited food arranged, 
it won’t get short.
[1051.68] Send it to the needy first 
because of whom God blesses us.
[1055.64] Hey, we have food late,
[1058.24] but some people have food in time.
 Okay?
[1061.04] Send it to them
[1062.64] Ask Wasim to send it to the needy. 
In fact, you leave it, I will ask him.
[1068.04] What do you do Afsheen?
[1086.08] Umm excuse me,
[1088.40] if you girls don’t mind,
[1090.16] can I borrow my fiancé from 
you guys for a bit?
[1094.88] Thank you, thank you so much.
[1101.88] Hmm, what happened?
[1104.20] Alizey, I wanted to,
[1106.76] I wanted to talk about something 
important with you.
[1110.68] What happened? 
Is everything okay?
[1115.36] No it’s not okay.
[1117.48] But promise me that 
you will understand me.
[1121.24] Tell me what happened?
[1124.32] Alizey, actually the things is that?
[1127.44] What?
[1131.56] you look very pretty today Alizey.
[1137.44] You send these girls from here 
to say this?
[1141.56] yes, so what?
[1144.48] Like they say
[1146.76] that if you want to say something like that,
[1150.24] you should immediately say it.
[1153.88] When I looked at you,
[1155.92] you looked so pretty so I couldn’t resist,
[1159.92] that is why I told everyone
[1162.60] that I am going to borrow you for a bit,
[1165.44] my Alizey.
[1171.32] I am very lucky,
[1174.04] very much.
[1177.48] Afnan, someone will see.
[1179.76] Hey, let them see then,
[1182.16] what are we doing?
[1183.48] We are talking to our fiancé,
showing love.
[1188.48] By the way, if dad sees me, 
he will pull my ears.
[1197.68] So sorry Sir,
[1199.16] actually our friend Alizey,
[1202.64] even she is getting married 
in the same hall,
[1205.20] I didn’t know that there is an engagement 
ceremony going on in this area,
[1208.52] I am so sorry, 
we had a misunderstanding.
[1211.56] It’s okay,
[1212.56] I guess you guys had to go to 
the portion next to this one,
[1214.96] you guys came here mistakenly,
[1216.48] I will ask guard to escort you there.
[1218.60] No, sir the guard is not needed, 
we will go on our own,
[1221.00] you hold these flowers, 
I will go on my own. Let’s go.
[1223.88] I was telling you that Alizey’s family
 cannot do such a nice set up
[1226.64] but you don’t listen to me.
[1227.80] What is my fault? 
You were also walking so slowly,
[1230.12] why are you telling me now? Don’t argue 
else the food will get over there.
[1232.84] oh God! You still care about the food? 
That is so embarrassing.
[1235.60] Let’s go, let’s go.
[1267.16] Are you okay? 
Do you need something?
[1269.28] I am absolutely fine, 
the dress is just very heavy.
[1272.08] You look very beautiful.
[1273.44] Thank you mom.
[1274.56] I thought I should ask you 
if you need anything to eat,
[1277.36] any juice or something. 
No, no, nothing.
[1279.40] Where is Afnan?
[1281.76] Afsheen?
[1284.88] I will be back in a second. 
Yes.
[1289.04] Yes, brother?
[1290.12] What are we waiting for?
[1292.72] Let’s do the engagement ceremony.
[1294.56] Okay.
[1296.08] Afnan, come let’s do the ceremony.
[1300.88] Let’s go. 
Why is Afnan needed?
[1302.76] Let’s do Alizey’s ceremony first and 
then later we will do Afnan’s too.
[1314.52] Brother, you wanted to do separate 
ceremonies for Alizey and Afnan?
[1320.88] yes, that is right, 
they are not married yet,
[1323.36] it doesn’t look appropriate that
they sit together for the ceremony.
[1336.76] Look Afsheen, I find it appropriate
[1339.40] that the engagement ceremony 
should be done separately.
[1344.48] okay, brother, as you wish.
[1346.96] Stay blessed.
[1347.88] You have always kept my word.
[1355.88] Afnan, go sit with your friends, 
we will do your ceremony later.
[1359.72] Okay Dad.
[1361.64] You call the ladies and 
start the ceremony, okay?
[1365.04] Okay.
[1373.72] What is this, mom?
[1375.44] Uncle has never said 
such a thing ever before,
[1378.24] I don’t want to get the ceremony 
done like this.
[1381.08] Shut up and sit Alizey,
[1383.92] I guess you are forgetting 
that you were his niece
[1386.32] and now you are her daughter-in-law-to-be.
[1390.08] Obviously, whatever traditions
[1392.80] he will follow will be done 
with his daughter-in-law.
[1395.40] Whatever it is mom, 
he is ruining my event.
[1401.76] Don’t spoil your mood.
[1403.80] Smile a little.
[1478.40] Enough Fahad.
[1480.24] Congratulations.
[1481.64] You are having a lot of fun.
[1485.16] I am regretting not being here
[1488.64] when uncle must have stooped Afnan 
from coming here.
[1491.56] Your mood must have been so off.
[1494.12] I missed it.
[1497.48] Do you have a phone?
[1499.80] Yes.
[1501.00] Give it to me.
[1513.88] Yes Fahad?
[1516.04] Alizey speaking.
[1519.20] Has uncle stopped you from coming 
on the stage after the engagement as well?
[1522.52] Umm, no, no, it’s not that,
[1525.64] I am coming, why would he stop me?
[1527.44] I am coming, okay? 
Don’t worry.
[1533.84] Okay don’t get angry, 
I will go call him.
[1536.48] Go. 
You come, come.
[1578.72] Fix your mood, 
people are watching Alizey.
[1582.28] Mom, I feel like going home right now.
[1587.48] Uncle hasn’t done good to me.
[1590.84] Afnan is coming, let me talk to him.
[1594.48] Have you gone mad Alizey?
[1597.60] You complain about brother to Afnan?
[1601.64] No boy tolerates her wife to be 
to go against his family
[1606.92] and that too at their engagement ceremony
[1609.40] and you know it very well that 
how much Afnan respects brother.
[1615.32] You won’t do anything like that.
[1617.92] Alizey, please
[1620.40] stay quiet for my honor,
[1623.16] I will explain everything to you 
when we get home.
[1624.88] Please, my love.
[1628.28] Fix your mood, please.
[1632.36] Hmm?
[1636.56] What will we do? The rickshaw driver 
is asking for so much money.
[1640.68] Let me do something wait.
[1642.56] In fact, do one thing,
[1643.96] call Shani and ask him to come here 
to pick both of us immediately.
[1647.24] Both? How will we sit on one bike?
[1649.32] We are skinny, we will manage,
[1651.40] it’s not a big deal, we are helpless,
[1653.44] we cannot pay that much 
to the rickshaw driver,
[1655.08] call that lazy man, 
he will take hours to reach.
[1657.56] He will take time to come because 
he is coming on the bike, not on an airplane.
[1660.76] Don’t argue much, 
hurry up and call.
[1663.36] I am. 
Wait.
[1665.96] everyone is so dressed up here.
[1672.00] Hello, brother actually…
[1721.24] Sir Afnan, Mr Qasim is calling you,
[1723.48] he wants to introduce you 
to some friends.
[1725.24] okay, You may go, 
I am coming.
[1728.84] I will be … 
What is this Afnan?
[1731.44] After the entire event now you have come
and sat here
[1733.56] and now we are getting pictures clicked, 
you are going again now?
[1739.24] Look,
[1741.20] all guests are looking at us,
[1744.72] fix your expression
[1747.04] and by the way, dad is calling me,
[1749.24] it is not a problem.
[1751.96] It’s our event Alizey, try to understand,
[1756.72] if I and dad won’t attend the guests,
 who else will do it?
[1763.12] Please fix your mood,
[1765.60] I don’t have brothers 
who can talk to all of them,
[1770.60] I have to look after all of them,
[1773.64] I am just going and 
I will be back in 5 minutes.
[1776.32] Okay.
[1793.04] Your brother hasn’t come yet, 
I don’t think he will come,
[1795.32] let’s do one thing, let’s go out 
and get a rickshaw.
[1797.32] And what if he comes?
[1799.32] If he will come then he will get home,
[1800.92] it’s more important for us to get home
 right now. Let’s go.
[1803.36] Come to this side, 
all the rickshaws are here.
[1811.52] I don’t understand that if they didn’t 
want to come with me
[1814.92] then why did they call me?
[1816.48] Annie was telling that they got a rickshaw
right after calling you,
[1822.44] Annie didn’t have a package 
to make calls
[1825.04] and ramsha’s phone’s battery 
was already dead
[1828.40] so she couldn’t talk to you.
[1832.84] Anyway, they are home now, 
don’t get angry.
[1838.28] Whatever it is, I got so perplexed.
[1839.80] So what?
[1841.32] If you got a little perplexed,
[1844.36] what is the harm in getting a little trouble 
for your sister?
[1848.88] Thank god that you got informed,
[1851.68] what if you wouldn’t have found 
the rickshaw?
[1855.28] Whatever it is, mom,
[1856.28] I am telling you this for one last time today,
[1858.64] I don’t want to see Annie going out 
with Ramsha anywhere again.
[1865.80] Ramsha can do whatever she wants
[1867.72] but any won’t go with her.
[1870.28] Just know that.
[1875.40] By the way,
[1876.88] to be honest, Shani is absolutely right.
[1883.84] The situation is not good these days,
[1888.16] we have to be very careful.
[1894.68] Now look,
[1896.68] girls are returning back such late at night,
[1898.92] you must be a little careful.
[1902.56] The girls told me that the event will end soon, 
before 9 to 10 o clock,
[1907.12] you know if I knew this, 
I would have never let the go,
[1913.12] anyway,
[1916.40] I will be careful next time.
[1918.80] Get me the electricity bill.
[1920.40] I will get it.
[1921.52] I will ask some boy from the shop 
to get it paid.
[1923.48] I will get it. 
What have I got?
[1931.04] Mom, I ma surprised how can uncle 
change so much so quickly?
[1936.44] I feel he has already accepted me 
as his daughter in law
[1939.48] that is why he is putting 
so much restrictions on me.
[1942.44] I mean why is he putting 
so much restrictions on me.
[1946.44] What has brother done that
 you are getting so angry?
[1950.24] Why are you feeling so bad Alizey?
[1953.48] Even if he had gotten his son engaged 
out of the family,
[1956.64] so he would have behaved 
the same way with that girl too.
[1962.56] Every in laws want their daughter in law to be
[1965.44] to adjust according to their mindset 
so what’s new in this?
[1970.64] Yes, it is new for you because your uncle has 
never been strict to you as an uncle
[1981.16] but now he is about to be your father in law
[1984.12] and you must understand that.
[1988.28] Obviously you will favor him 
because you are his sister.
[1993.04] What is this behavior, Alizey?
[1994.64] He is the same uncle because of whom 
we are living a peaceful life.
[2004.36] If brother wanted,
[2005.96] he could have brought any strange girl 
and made her his daughter in law
[2010.24] but he didn’t do that.
[2012.96] He has always prioritized my happiness
 and your wish.
[2021.48] Now I don’t want to listen to a word 
against brother from your mouth.
[2028.96] You know what is the problem 
with your generation?
[2031.24] If we scold you a bit or be a little strict,
[2033.16] you guys forget all the previous love 
and favors
[2039.72] and you guys start considering 
your elders as your enemies.
[2046.08] I am getting tea made, change this,
[2048.60] take that tea and go to your uncle
[2051.88] he will like it.
[2069.40] Look, Ramsha’s video has gotten viral,
[2072.16] check out her views, millions of views.
[2076.32] Why are they all standing here?
[2078.40] Ramsha, Ramsha, Ramsha?
[2080.56] What happened? 
Why have you guys crowded here?
[2083.08] The famous girl. You don’t know?
[2086.24] no,
[2086.88] your video has gone viral.
[2089.92] Oh ho!

[2092.00] Which video? Show me.

[2094.64] Look at this.
[2095.60] oh my God.
[2096.68] People are properly discussing this video.
Look at this.
[2099.60] Oh my God, Annie..
[2102.88] But you will take a picture with me first
[2105.84] so that people know that 
we are best friends.
[2109.88] I am so happy. Show me 
how many likes are there?
[2112.92] So many likes and look at the views 
they are so many.
[2115.08] 2 million man, 2 million.
[2156.92] Mom? come quickly, 
Annie come quickly.
[2159.20] Mom?
[2161.36] What happened?
[2163.36] Mom, I am so happy today, so happy
that you can’t even imagine.
[2166.00] Oh, what happened?
[2167.04] I have gotten the biggest happiness
 of my life.
[2171.32] Really?
[2172.44] So that means my daughter got 
her result, right?
[2174.72] And you have passed 
with a very good score?
[2176.92] Oh! Mom, no,
[2178.88] it was the old times when the result 
used to be celebrated,
[2182.00] we get happy for different reasons nowadays.
[2185.32] Ok then tell us something?
[2186.76] Annie, you tell us, 
she will just keep on screaming.
[2189.96] Mom, aunt, Ramsha’s video has gone viral.
[2193.32] Hmm. 
What video has gone viral?
[2196.08] Yes mom, that video that I showed you
 of shopping the other day?
[2199.52] It has gone viral, 
I have gotten millions views on it.
[2203.36] Mom, everyone was after me 
at the university today,
[2206.48] everyone took so many pictures with me,
[2208.52] so many selfies that 
you cannot even imagine.
[2210.92] You know the girls who wouldn’t 
even talk to me and didn’t know me,
[2214.64] even they got pictures with me.
[2217.28] Your daughter is famous now.
[2220.04] Tell me what is there to be 
so happy about?
[2223.24] Yes?
[2225.28] What do you guys know?
[2226.96] I have become so famous that people 
know me by the name of shopping girl now.
[2231.80] And you know that
[2233.16] Hania was telling me all her cousins 
are my fans now,
[2236.40] everyone wants to meet me.
[2237.84] Annie, tell them how much protocol did I get 
in the university today?
[2240.52] yes aunt, every girl was looking for Ramsha
[2243.08] and everyone was giving her so much 
importance like she is an actual celebrity.
