Go, get out of the car. Forgive me once. Afnan, it will never happen again. I am accepting my mistake 
and even apologizing to you. You haven’t made a mistake, you have sinned, it’s a sin to betray your husband. Afnan, if a person is guilty over 
their mistake, even God forgives. Forgive me, please, Afnan. God’s mercy is very vast on His men, 
Ramsha, a human being is not so generous. You must pray that God melts my heart for you but there is no place for you 
in my heart right now. Afnan? Here, have tea, and stop having 
so much Tea, your sugar levels will spike. Hmm. Who is it at this time? 
I don’t know, I will go check. Ramsha? Greetings. Greetings, you have come alone? No, Afnan has dropped me. Actually, he is going abroad and it will take time for him to come back,
so he asked me to stay with you guys. Ramsha? 
Greetings. Greetings. My child, is everything okay? 
You are here at this time? And where is Afnan? No, Afnan has dropped me and left. Actually, he has his flight, 
he has to go, he is traveling abroad. So asked me to stay with you guys
for some time. Okay, okay. Annie, my child, 
take your sister to the room. Come let’s go. everything will be fine. 
At least stop crying. you know I cannot tolerate you crying. You made the soup yourself? Yes. it must be very bad. Afnan. Try it, Shall I feed you? Not bad. You have hurt me a lot, Afnan. I have gone through a lot of difficulties. Look I know you had to go 
through hell because of me but now I promise you that from now onwards I won’t let 
tears come in your eyes. If I hadn’t promised my Dad, I would have taken you and thrown you
out of my life right here, right now. I feel disgusted in myself that
I chose a girl like you, but enough, its good you did this, at least my eyes are opened now. I am telling you not to show me 
your face ever again, that’s it. No Afnan, what is wrong with you? How can you say this Afnan? 
What is all this that you are saying? Ramsha don’t do this. What you are saying is hurting me,
 Afnan. Afnan I will die… Die! If you want to die, then go die. And after what you have done, 
it will be better if you die. Afnan, if a person is guilty over 
their mistake, even God forgives. Forgive me, please, Afnan. God’s mercy is very vast on His men, 
Ramsha, a human being is not so generous. You must pray that God melts my heart for you but there is no place for you 
in my heart right now. Afnan? Ramsha, water? You sleep peacefully, okay? Thank you but I am not sleepy right now. You are unable to sleep without
 brother Afnan? Do you know, brother Afnan must be
going through the same there. You are very lucky, 
you got who you loved, you got your love Ramsha. Annie, love happens, rules of love happen too but to fulfill the rights of love
 is very difficult. Fulfill the rights of love? 
What is that? when a person loves someone, being loyal to them is called 
the right of love. I never thought that. You have become so much wiser. Why don’t you call him 
if you miss him so much? You married me because 
you found out I was innocent so that you can give me support. No, not at all. The truth is that I love you, Ramsha, I love you a lot. The truth is that my false hate got defeated 
in front of my true love. Hey Annie, give it to me, 
I will do it. There is no need, 
you are a guest, you don’t have to do these works now. I am not at all a guest in this house, it is my house and I can never be a guest 
in this house, in fact, you are a guest. Aunt was telling me there is a 
marriage proposal for you and you are about to get married soon. Yes, just pray everything happens smoothly. I am just waiting for the response 
from the guy’s family, if they like her, I have decided, I won’t get into engagement and all, 
I will get her directly married. If God wills, if God wills. If God wills. And pray that Shani gets a nice job as well, 
then, if God wills. And then I will also think something
about Shani. don’t worry about me, Mom, think about Annie, 
I am not going to get married. Brother has changed a lot, he has become very serious too and responsible too. He has realized his mistake. Umm, I made soup for Uncle, let me go check
 that it didn’t burn. Annie? Did Ramsha tell you anything when will Afnan come to pick her up, 
it has been so many days. When has it been so many days?
It has just been a few days. It’s good that she came 
because of this, else she never used to come, 
why are you tensed? No, my child, girls look nice in their home, 
in their husband’s home. Ever since she has come, I feel strange, 
I think there is something. And did you see that Afnan didn’t call her ever 
since she came here? Yes, I noticed that too. Neither brother Afnan called her, 
nor did she call him. You go and soak these. How many times have I asked you 
not to call me? I don’t want to talk to you. Afnan, I am guilty in my mistake, I have even apologized to you and 
you are still punishing me. I admit that I came to Aunt’s house 
without informing you the other day but, at least listen to the complete thing once, give me a chance to say something. How should I listen to you? And what should I believe? You haven’t just betrayed me once
but multiple times, you have hurt my trust in you 
multiple times. I don’t believe in anything 
you say now, Ramsha. And I know it very well why you go 
running at your aunt’s house all the time. Afnan, what are you saying? What do you think that I come here
because of Shani? That is why you have left me here,
 Afnan? I am surprised how can you think like this about me,
 Afnan? What should I do then? Should I leave you here to bear 
all the sorrows? What will you do if he doesn’t believe 
in anything you say later? I will tolerate. You stop worrying about me. why should I not worry? Why will you bear everything? 
Why don’t you leave him? What are you trying to say? Divorce Shani and marry me. No Ramsha, you are not trying to understand, I am bearing so much trouble for you, try to make you understand with 
so much love, but you, girls like you can never understand 
and you do what you feel like. Afnan, there is nothing like that,
at least listen to me. I don't want to listen to you, Ramsha, you know what? It’s wrong to expect anything from you. It is my fault, it is my mistake that I thought that you will change 
your path and come back to me but no, the ones who have turned their faces, you can stop their way but cannot change their direction. You? What are you here for? Mr Afnan, I need to talk to you 
about something. Look I don’t know what are the conflicts 
between you and Ramsha but she is so worried, she loves you a lot, I have seen her crying 
for you myself. Okay, so it has come to this point now? By the way I didn’t expect this
 from Ramsha, that she will stoop so low that she will send you to speak 
on her behalf here. Mr Afnan, you are getting it wrong,
there is nothing like that, whatever you are doing to her is wrong. I am doing wrong? Shani, I, I don’t want to listen to anything 
you want to say. It will be better if you leave right now. You are doing wrong to her, 
don’t do this. I can’t believe you are saying 
this to me, Shani. I am doing wrong to Ramsha? What do you know what misunderstanding
has been created between us? And you were the one 
who did wrong to her, did you forget, how cruel and brutal 
you were to Ramsha? How can you come here and 
tell me today that I am doing wrong to her though 
you don’t even know anything? You are right, what I did to her I am being punished
for it and I am regretting it but I want you not to repeat 
the same mistake I made. I am regretting too, Shani, I regret falling in love with Ramsha. I regret always protecting her. I regret making her the honor of this house 
and bringing her into this house, but what did I get in return for my love? Just regret. As far as you are concerned, if you have so much regret, and if you have any such wish 
in any corner of your heart, so I might leave Ramsha and 
she might come back to you, forget that Shani, I still love Ramsha as much as I used to love her 
when you were being cruel to her. So, no matter what happens, I won’t leave Ramsha. It will be better if you leave, I don’t want to talk to you about anything.
