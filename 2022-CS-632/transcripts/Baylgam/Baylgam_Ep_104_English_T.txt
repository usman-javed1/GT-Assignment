[26.16] Go, get out of the car.
[28.72] Forgive me once.
[37.08] Afnan, it will never happen again.
[45.84] I am accepting my mistake 
and even apologizing to you.
[48.88] You haven’t made a mistake,
[51.40] you have sinned,
[62.48] it’s a sin to betray your husband.
[67.16] Afnan, if a person is guilty over 
their mistake, even God forgives.
[79.68] Forgive me, please, Afnan.
[82.96] God’s mercy is very vast on His men, 
Ramsha,
[94.20] a human being is not so generous.
[102.84] You must pray
[105.12] that God melts my heart for you
[114.48] but there is no place for you 
in my heart right now.
[117.76] Afnan?
[185.64] Here, have tea, and stop having 
so much Tea,
[189.76] your sugar levels will spike.
[191.56] Hmm.
[196.88] Who is it at this time? 
I don’t know, I will go check.
[241.28] Ramsha?
[244.08] Greetings.
[245.40] Greetings,
[247.92] you have come alone?
[249.28] No, Afnan has dropped me.
[258.60] Actually, he is going abroad
[261.56] and it will take time for him to come back,
so he asked me to stay with you guys.
[266.68] Ramsha? 
Greetings.
[268.24] Greetings.
[269.72] My child, is everything okay? 
You are here at this time?
[272.28] And where is Afnan?
[278.60] No, Afnan has dropped me and left.
[290.76] Actually, he has his flight, 
he has to go,
[293.64] he is traveling abroad.
[307.88] So asked me to stay with you guys
for some time.
[311.00] Okay, okay.
[313.48] Annie, my child, 
take your sister to the room.
[316.24] Come let’s go.
[435.48] everything will be fine. 
At least stop crying.
[437.64] you know I cannot tolerate you crying.
[443.72] You made the soup yourself?
[445.40] Yes.
[446.76] it must be very bad.
[449.40] Afnan. Try it, Shall I feed you?
[464.12] Not bad.
[488.84] You have hurt me a lot, Afnan.
[494.20] I have gone through a lot of difficulties.
[503.40] Look I know you had to go 
through hell because of me
[512.28] but now I promise you
[515.68] that from now onwards I won’t let 
tears come in your eyes.
[530.00] If I hadn’t promised my Dad,
[533.12] I would have taken you and thrown you
out of my life right here, right now.
[540.24] I feel disgusted in myself that
I chose a girl like you,
[544.72] but enough, its good you did this,
[548.96] at least my eyes are opened now.
[553.72] I am telling you not to show me 
your face ever again, that’s it.
[557.08] No Afnan, what is wrong with you?
[559.08] How can you say this Afnan? 
What is all this that you are saying?
[563.76] Ramsha don’t do this.
[565.16] What you are saying is hurting me,
 Afnan. Afnan I will die…
[566.64] Die!
[569.92] If you want to die, then go die.
[575.48] And after what you have done, 
it will be better if you die.
[600.56] Afnan, if a person is guilty over 
their mistake, even God forgives.
[605.08] Forgive me, please, Afnan.
[608.32] God’s mercy is very vast on His men, 
Ramsha,
[615.88] a human being is not so generous.
[620.60] You must pray
[622.80] that God melts my heart for you
[628.56] but there is no place for you 
in my heart right now.
[631.64] Afnan?
[658.08] Ramsha,
[660.48] water?
[662.92] You sleep peacefully, okay?
[666.76] Thank you
[668.72] but I am not sleepy right now.
[671.04] You are unable to sleep without
 brother Afnan?
[676.84] Do you know, brother Afnan must be
going through the same there.
[688.28] You are very lucky, 
you got who you loved,
[700.52] you got your love Ramsha.
[704.48] Annie, love happens,
[707.96] rules of love happen too
[715.56] but to fulfill the rights of love
 is very difficult.
[722.24] Fulfill the rights of love? 
What is that?
[735.96] when a person loves someone,
[747.16] being loyal to them is called 
the right of love.
[751.72] I never thought that.
[765.52] You have become so much wiser.
[775.32] Why don’t you call him 
if you miss him so much?
[800.52] You married me because 
you found out I was innocent
[808.92] so that you can give me support.
[811.92] No,
[813.88] not at all.
[819.68] The truth is that
[823.64] I love you, Ramsha,
[830.40] I love you a lot.
[836.28] The truth is that
[839.72] my false hate got defeated 
in front of my true love.
[861.84] Hey Annie, give it to me, 
I will do it.
[863.80] There is no need, 
you are a guest,
[866.28] you don’t have to do these works now.
[868.52] I am not at all a guest in this house,
[871.20] it is my house
[872.92] and I can never be a guest 
in this house,
[875.08] in fact, you are a guest.
[884.44] Aunt was telling me there is a 
marriage proposal for you
[886.76] and you are about to get married soon.
[894.92] Yes,
[896.28] just pray everything happens smoothly.
[913.80] I am just waiting for the response 
from the guy’s family,
[916.60] if they like her,
[925.24] I have decided,
[926.80] I won’t get into engagement and all, 
I will get her directly married.
[930.32] If God wills, if God wills.
[932.00] If God wills. And pray
[934.28] that Shani gets a nice job as well, 
then, if God wills.
[942.12] And then I will also think something
about Shani.
[968.24] don’t worry about me, Mom,
[971.16] think about Annie, 
I am not going to get married.
[1005.84] Brother has changed a lot,
[1019.32] he has become very serious too
[1022.04] and responsible too.
[1031.00] He has realized his mistake.
[1035.24] Umm,
[1036.60] I made soup for Uncle, let me go check
 that it didn’t burn.
[1043.08] Annie?
[1048.24] Did Ramsha tell you anything
[1051.32] when will Afnan come to pick her up, 
it has been so many days.
[1054.40] When has it been so many days?
It has just been a few days.
[1062.32] It’s good that she came 
because of this,
[1064.00] else she never used to come, 
why are you tensed?
[1066.52] No, my child,
[1069.36] girls look nice in their home, 
in their husband’s home.
[1081.72] Ever since she has come,
[1085.88] I feel strange, 
I think there is something.
[1096.68] And did you see
[1105.68] that Afnan didn’t call her ever 
since she came here?
[1109.32] Yes,
[1111.04] I noticed that too.
[1118.32] Neither brother Afnan called her, 
nor did she call him.
[1131.16] You go and soak these.
[1221.56] How many times have I asked you 
not to call me?
[1228.80] I don’t want to talk to you.
[1230.92] Afnan,
[1232.60] I am guilty in my mistake,
[1239.64] I have even apologized to you and 
you are still punishing me.
[1249.64] I admit that I came to Aunt’s house 
without informing you the other day but,
[1260.60] at least listen to the complete thing once,
[1262.72] give me a chance to say something.
[1264.52] How should I listen to you?
[1273.16] And what should I believe?
[1275.72] You haven’t just betrayed me once
but multiple times,
[1285.12] you have hurt my trust in you 
multiple times.
[1294.84] I don’t believe in anything 
you say now, Ramsha.
[1305.80] And I know it very well why you go 
running at your aunt’s house all the time.
[1310.44] Afnan,
[1312.84] what are you saying?
[1321.88] What do you think that I come here
because of Shani?
[1331.36] That is why you have left me here,
 Afnan?
[1341.00] I am surprised
[1342.88] how can you think like this about me,
 Afnan?
[1375.52] What should I do then?
[1376.80] Should I leave you here to bear 
all the sorrows?
[1380.16] What will you do if he doesn’t believe 
in anything you say later?
[1385.52] I will tolerate.
[1392.08] You stop worrying about me.
[1394.68] why should I not worry?
[1402.32] Why will you bear everything? 
Why don’t you leave him?
[1406.08] What are you trying to say?
[1409.92] Divorce Shani and marry me.
[1416.32] No Ramsha,
[1418.00] you are not trying to understand,
[1421.04] I am bearing so much trouble for you,
[1422.84] try to make you understand with 
so much love, but you,
[1425.60] girls like you can never understand 
and you do what you feel like.
[1430.96] Afnan, there is nothing like that,
at least listen to me.
[1433.08] I don't want to listen to you, Ramsha,
[1437.76] you know what?
[1438.88] It’s wrong to expect anything from you.
[1444.44] It is my fault, it is my mistake
[1446.96] that I thought that you will change 
your path and come back to me but no,
[1453.20] the ones who have turned their faces,
[1455.96] you can stop their way
[1458.44] but cannot change their direction.
[1493.80] You?
[1498.08] What are you here for?
[1501.24] Mr Afnan, I need to talk to you 
about something.
[1513.88] Look I don’t know what are the conflicts 
between you and Ramsha
[1522.04] but she is so worried,
[1536.76] she loves you a lot,
[1548.52] I have seen her crying 
for you myself.
[1553.32] Okay,
[1563.40] so it has come to this point now?
[1572.96] By the way I didn’t expect this
 from Ramsha,
[1584.56] that she will stoop so low that
[1587.84] she will send you to speak 
on her behalf here.
[1592.68] Mr Afnan, you are getting it wrong,
there is nothing like that,
[1597.20] whatever you are doing to her is wrong.
[1599.48] I am doing wrong?
[1606.08] Shani, I,
[1608.12] I don’t want to listen to anything 
you want to say.
[1617.36] It will be better if you leave right now.
[1623.00] You are doing wrong to her, 
don’t do this.
[1630.52] I can’t believe you are saying 
this to me, Shani.
[1642.12] I am doing wrong to Ramsha?
[1651.20] What do you know what misunderstanding
has been created between us?
[1663.72] And you were the one 
who did wrong to her,
[1680.64] did you forget,
[1684.08] how cruel and brutal 
you were to Ramsha?
[1696.40] How can you come here and 
tell me today that
[1698.76] I am doing wrong to her though 
you don’t even know anything?
[1706.72] You are right,
[1717.56] what I did to her I am being punished
for it and I am regretting it
[1731.04] but I want you not to repeat 
the same mistake I made.
[1740.96] I am regretting too, Shani,
[1753.24] I regret falling in love with Ramsha.
[1766.24] I regret always protecting her.
[1779.64] I regret making her the honor of this house 
and bringing her into this house,
[1796.76] but what did I get in return for my love?
[1806.40] Just regret.
[1818.28] As far as you are concerned,
[1822.20] if you have so much regret,
[1826.68] and if you have any such wish 
in any corner of your heart,
[1831.40] so I might leave Ramsha and 
she might come back to you,
[1835.32] forget that Shani,
[1847.40] I still love Ramsha
[1857.92] as much as I used to love her 
when you were being cruel to her.
[1871.92] So, no matter what happens,
[1876.28] I won’t leave Ramsha.
[1888.60] It will be better if you leave,
[1891.60] I don’t want to talk to you about anything.
