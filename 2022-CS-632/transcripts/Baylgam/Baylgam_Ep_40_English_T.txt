[31.28] If I had to get you with illegitimate ways,
[35.48] then it was not difficult for me.
[38.28] But I am not in the habit of taking 
someone else’s right.
[42.32] Hey, why will you take away her right?
[45.16] What has that poor thing done to you?
[48.00] And me?
[49.60] When did I promise you 
that I will marry you?
[52.56] Did I ever say that I love you? 
Why are you after me?
[58.24] The truth is you are envious of me 
and my happiness.
[62.60] You don’t want to see 
my happy with Alizeh,
[64.80] and you are having a problem 
because I am accepting Alizeh.
[68.00] Don’t put an allegation on me, Afnan.
[69.76] If this is not an allegation, 
then why are you doing all this?
[72.72] Why did you come here? 
Leave from here.
[79.92] The truth is you love me,
[83.04] and this love is your helplessness 
that is why you are not going from here.
[98.76] You know, Afnan,
[100.76] I had never thought we would get 
married so soon.
[104.20] How could we not get married soon?
[106.04] I have loved you a lot.
[108.28] Even I have loved you a lot. 
Okay, prove it then.
[113.56] What do you mean?
[115.56] Okay see,
[117.08] I have also got your name written 
on my hand.
[118.56] Oh yes,
[120.72] but my name was written in your hands 
from the start.
[178.76] Madam Ramsha,
[179.84] Mr. Qasim sent this dress for you.
[225.72] Greetings.
[228.32] Greetings.
[229.96] Thank you so much, 
it is a really good dress.
[232.36] But uncle…
But? Did you not like it?
[234.72] You had sent it, 
so how could I not like it?
[237.24] But uncle.
[238.96] But what child?
[240.76] I was thinking what would I do 
coming to the wedding?
[244.20] I don’t know anyone there.
[248.24] I will get bored there, alone.
[250.60] You people go there comfortably, 
I will stay at home, uncle.
[255.24] Okay, you know no one.
[258.84] Then you should surely come 
to the wedding.
[261.44] If you meet people, 
then you will know them.
[263.56] You will like it there.
[265.84] And a lot of daughters of your age 
are there in the family,
[268.96] I will tell them to take you along. 
They will not let you get bored.
[273.12] Look child,
[274.60] meet people, this way you will like it.
[278.36] If you stay home then I will keep 
on thinking about you.
[283.52] What do you say?
[286.76] Okay, if you say so, 
then I will come along.
[290.28] Yes, and smile.
[293.56] Smile is sign of being thankful. 
Yes, like this.
[297.72] Thank you. 
Come on.
[479.76] What is this?
[482.64] You are crying?
[488.08] You feel like crying seeing your lovers
in someone else’s arms.
[496.76] What are you looking at me 
like that for?
[499.40] I was consoling you.
[506.00] Look,
[507.60] if you want then I can get 
this wedding broken.
[512.52] I know.
[514.56] You know well how to break marriages.
[517.76] It is something you know like 
the back of your hand.
[521.40] I think you remember your time.
[524.80] You know that cousin of mine, Nabeel,
[527.92] he is really happy nowadays.
[530.36] He is married.
[532.12] In fact, now he will be the father 
of a child soon, too.
[538.04] You are a really cheap man.
[542.64] I am not cheap.
[545.20] If I was cheap, then I would have 
replied to your slap right at that time.
[551.60] I am an imbecile.
[558.88] An imbecile, surely shows his true colours.
[568.32] He turns back and attacks.
[582.52] Listen. Hey…
[591.76] She got upset.
[644.32] Ramsha.
[645.80] Child, is everything fine? 
Why are you sitting alone like this?
[649.88] Uncle, there are so many people,
[652.80] my heart was worried, 
that is why I came here.
[655.20] Are you feeling alright?
[656.88] Yes, yes, I am fine. 
Don’t worry.
[659.80] There are so many guests, 
you give them time. I am fine.
[663.36] Okay, I will take care of the guests.
[666.64] You too come along.
[715.24] Today my daughter looks really pretty,
[717.96] I have warded off the evil eye from you.
[719.76] Thank you so much, mama.
[720.96] That’s so unfair aunt.
[724.48] You even find your daughter 
to be pretty today,
[726.92] I mean, I don’t look good at all.
[732.16] My nephew is the best.
[734.04] Thank you.
[735.36] Did you people hear it? Huh?
[738.80] Ramsha.
[744.36] Ramsha, where is Rasheeda?
I had kept the ring with her,
[747.72] go and check.
[749.68] Sure. 
Ramsha,
[752.28] see, how good this dress looks on you.
[767.64] Mama,
[770.20] I had told you that this dress would 
look really good on Ramsha.
[780.28] What do you say, Afnan?
[783.08] This dress looks good on Ramsha, right?
[785.56] Err..
[787.04] Ramsha…
[788.40] Now you will get into useless doubt if he 
praises another girl in the presence of his bride.
[798.00] Why would I doubt, Afnan?
[807.84] Whatever he is like, 
he is in front of me.
[821.52] Right, Afnan?
[825.20] Yes, of course.
[847.36] Brother brought a girl off the streets home.
[850.84] We made him understand a lot,
[852.36] that who brings a girl off the streets like this?
[855.36] But what can we say?
[856.88] We cannot even say anything 
in front of brother…
[858.96] You go and keep all the sweets 
on the stage. Go.
[861.04] This is that girl.
Greetings.
[862.88] Who brother has kept in the home.
[869.36] You people know, brother cares 
a lot about the poor.
[882.04] The dress she is wearing,
[883.96] brother has got for her. 
It is a really expensive dress.
[887.08] I had even told brother
[889.04] that there are so many clothes of Alizeh,
[891.16] that she doesn’t wear anymore.
[893.68] Give them to her, she will wear them.
[900.04] But no, brother didn’t listen.
[903.08] He got her such an expensive dress.
[913.56] You people know,
[915.56] these poor people are not in the habit 
to wear such expensive clothes.
[925.24] Yes, Afsheen, this is really good.
[928.20] Both you brother and 
sister are really good.
[931.08] You not only supported this poor girl,
[933.76] in fact, you even think about her so much.
[942.40] You people are so aware of my habit.
[944.92] I cannot see someone else’s sorrow.
[956.52] You people sit, I will come.
[958.72] Thank you people so much that 
you came to the wedding,
[961.40] you took out so much time.
[985.48] Brother is the cleric here?
[988.44] No, the wedding registrar is here.
[992.24] I will lead Afnan’s wedding myself.
[1005.52] See,
[1007.76] what could be better than this 
if the father leads his son’s wedding
[1013.36] and just like that the son leads 
the father’s funeral.
[1016.24] You should have this much knowledge 
of the religion.
[1019.72] So, if you allow, then should we start?
[1022.88] Brother, you said something good. 
I pray to God everyone thinks this.
[1026.08] Amen. 
May God give you life.
[1027.80] Come on. 
We will take their permission.
[1029.28] Come, Mr. Registrar. Sit, son.
[1050.64] Alizeh Ahmed, daughter of Nisar Ahmed,
[1055.20] we are marrying you to Afnan Ali,
[1058.24] son of Qasim Ali,
[1060.00] with a wedding gift of five hundred 
thousand rupees.
[1062.80] Do we have your permission?
[1066.92] Yes, you have my permissions.
[1298.88] Madam Ramsha.
[1301.84] God be kind.
[1310.88] Madam Ramsha.
[1312.88] Madam Ramsha. Madam Ramsha.
[1316.36] Madam Ramsha.
[1390.00] What is the matter, Ramsha?
[1391.52] How did you faint? 
Are you feeling okay?
[1395.64] Okay, you are fine, child?
 Let’s go to the doctor?
[1400.44] No uncle, I just want to go home.
[1404.16] I feel really restless, 
I feel my heart will stop.
[1407.80] God be kind.
[1417.00] Okay, lets go to the doctor. 
Ask the driver to take out the car.
[1420.48] No, uncle, I don’t want to go 
to the doctor.
[1423.56] Please send me home. 
I feel restless.
[1427.52] There are a lot of people here.
[1428.80] I will go home and rest, 
I will be fine.
[1430.72] You please have the car placed, 
I will go home.
[1442.96] Brother, I think I will ask the driver 
to drop her home.
[1447.40] You do one thing, send Tabassum 
home with her. Okay?
[1451.20] Yes, fine.
[1452.32] I will go check on the driver.
[1454.00] Child, careful. Careful.
Rest your back. Rest your back.
[1457.72] Here, have water.
[1460.88] Calmly.
[1463.04] That’s it. That’s it.
[1506.72] I am surprised.
[1508.76] I had thought that the bride really 
feels shy on her wedding night,
[1515.40] she doesn’t look in her groom’s eyes.
[1517.72] But here, everything is the opposite.
[1520.68] You are really casual, 
you are going to change,
[1523.88] and you are not feeling shy at all.
[1526.72] I tried a lot to feel shy like a 
newlywed bride,
[1532.72] but I wont be able to do this Afnan.
[1535.32] We have spent so much time 
with each other,
[1538.04] that I have no shame or 
hesitation towards you.
[1542.72] And if you wanted such a shy girl,
[1545.52] then you should have married 
someone else.
[1549.88] By the way, Afnan. 
Yes?
[1551.76] Tell me something. 
Ask?
[1555.48] Have you loved some other girl 
other than me?
[1560.20] I mean, we are humans,
[1562.00] we can love anyone.
[1564.40] We cannot control that.
[1568.04] What is wrong with you?
[1571.24] Is this the time to ask these questions?
[1574.84] Afnan, tell me.
[1578.12] Did you ever love any other girl?
[1584.24] No. No.
[1587.28] I have not thought about any other girl
apart from you.
[1595.96] As far as love is concerned,
[1599.64] I have only loved you.
[1602.36] Only you.
[1605.28] Are you speaking the truth?
[1607.08] You have never loved any other girl?
[1611.16] What is wrong with you?
[1613.08] I am speaking the truth and 
today is our special night,
[1616.80] so I thought…
[1620.00] This? When did you buy this?
[1625.96] The thing is that,
[1628.52] just because we are cousins,
[1629.92] it doesn’t mean I will share 
all my secrets with you.
[1634.56] After all, had I told you I am buying 
this beautiful ring for you,
[1638.64] then it wouldn’t have remained 
a surprise for you.
[1641.44] How do you like it?
[1644.68] It is really beautiful.
[1647.56] Not more than you.
[1708.76] Ramsha.
[1713.60] Afnan.
[1716.72] Have a seat.
[1718.00] You…
[1757.80] Where is my gift?
[1759.76] Madam, these flowers I got for you
are your gift.
[1763.56] This?
Yes.
[1764.76] I don’t want flowers, 
they will die till tomorrow.
[1768.12] Oh wow,
[1769.68] there is something.
[1771.24] You are really logical at times.
[1774.16] These flowers will die till tomorrow.
[1776.48] Fine, then, your gift is due on me.
[1786.00] Hey, listen,
[1787.84] where did you get these bangles from? 
They are really good.
[1790.40] The bangles are made of glass.
[1792.24] Yes, so what if they are made of glass, 
they look good.
[1795.12] I am surprised. 
Who likes glass bangles?
[1798.40] I really like bangles in the wrists of girls,
[1801.36] but they look really special in your wrist.
[1809.32] My mama and papa want 
to get me married.
[1814.04] Your marriage?
Yes.
[1818.28] But why? What is the hurry?
[1820.72] Make them understand, tell them,
[1823.64] you want to resume your education,
[1826.12] so you cannot get married right now.
[1828.44] I am tired of making them understand.
[1830.40] Those people are not willing 
to listen to me.
[1833.36] Okay relax,
[1835.32] don’t stress so much so easily.
[1837.52] You tell them that you want to be 
a girl from today’s time.
[1844.20] A girl who is strong, independent, 
who is well educated,
[1848.28] who can stand on her own feet.
[1850.72] I am sure they will agree.
[1854.40] Oh God.
[1856.96] which test am I stuck in?
[1929.80] Greetings.
[1933.00] Hey, Ramsha, child, why are you 
standing here right now?
[1937.16] And why are your eyes swollen? 
It feels like you have not slept all night.
[1943.20] How can I sleep uncle?
I don’t feel sleepy.
[1949.48] I stay up all night long.
[1955.32] The peace has left my life.
[1962.08] You pray to God, right?
[1965.40] You are really religious.
[1968.32] You pray to God that 
He gives me peace.
[1971.96] God, answers all your prayers, right?
[1976.40] May God make better decisions for you.
[1982.36] But this thing that you are saying to me,
[1985.44] say this to God.
[1987.84] He knows it all. He listens to everyone.
[1991.52] You pray, He will also listen to you.
[1994.36] Me?
[1996.28] I am a sinner.
[1998.40] I have committed a lot of sins,
[2000.52] how can I pray for myself?
[2003.12] You pray for me, God will surely 
answer your prayers.
[2008.52] You will pray, right?
[2013.68] You know,
[2015.36] God lives in a broken heart,
[2019.88] and the cry of a broken heart is a prayer.
[2024.76] You know,
[2026.64] have you ever thought 
why you don’t find peace?
[2034.20] Because you too, like me, 
believe in God,
[2041.20] but you don’t listen to God.
[2044.04] You know we ask God to make us
 capable of walking the right path.
[2049.56] Oh God show us the straight path, right?
[2055.08] When any person,
[2057.44] any servant of God seeks forgiveness 
with a true heart,
[2064.52] their mistakes and sins are washed away.
[2067.12] You know how?
Like we wash clothes well,
[2072.28] or how we wash the dishes with ashes
or some detergent or powder,
[2077.88] the same way the tears in your eyes,
[2081.68] wash away all the stains.
[2084.36] If God sees two tears 
in the eyes of someone
[2090.44] and they offer prayers with it, 
then God forgives them.
[2094.60] Are you speaking the truth?
[2096.00] Hey, yes,
[2097.44] Allama Muhammad Iqbal says,
[2101.36] God picked up your tears 
considering them pearls,
[2105.64] they were just tears.
[2110.24] What does this mean?
[2112.36] Tears of embarrassment.
[2115.52] God has blessed you with this wealth,
[2119.04] pray that God also blesses me with it.
[2122.08] Live long.
[2126.20] These tears are proof of a prayer 
getting answered.
[2130.56] They are the receipt of a prayer 
being answered.
[2133.04] Present it to God,
[2136.36] He really likes these tears.
[2139.76] Live long.
[2182.76] Oh my God,
[2186.48] you are really forgiving.
[2189.64] You are really forgiving.
[2194.40] It is really hard for me 
to take care of myself,
[2200.08] but nothing is difficult.
[2205.08] You asks for something to be done, 
and it gets done.
[2212.00] My God,
[2214.48] for the sake of your beloved Prophet (P.B.U.H),
[2221.36] you help me.
[2225.28] Forgive my sins.
[2229.24] I know
[2230.84] I have committed a lot of sins.
[2233.36] I have been disobedient to you, 
I didn’t listen to You.
[2239.60] I know I am a sinner. 
I have made a lot of mistakes,
[2244.88] forgive me.
[2247.76] Forgive me.
[2250.92] Forgive me, God. 
Forgive me.
[2256.56] Amen.
[2260.20] Amen.
