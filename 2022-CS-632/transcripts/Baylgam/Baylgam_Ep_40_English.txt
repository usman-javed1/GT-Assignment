If I had to get you with illegitimate ways, then it was not difficult for me. But I am not in the habit of taking 
someone else’s right. Hey, why will you take away her right? What has that poor thing done to you? And me? When did I promise you 
that I will marry you? Did I ever say that I love you? 
Why are you after me? The truth is you are envious of me 
and my happiness. You don’t want to see 
my happy with Alizeh, and you are having a problem 
because I am accepting Alizeh. Don’t put an allegation on me, Afnan. If this is not an allegation, 
then why are you doing all this? Why did you come here? 
Leave from here. The truth is you love me, and this love is your helplessness 
that is why you are not going from here. You know, Afnan, I had never thought we would get 
married so soon. How could we not get married soon? I have loved you a lot. Even I have loved you a lot. 
Okay, prove it then. What do you mean? Okay see, I have also got your name written 
on my hand. Oh yes, but my name was written in your hands 
from the start. Madam Ramsha, Mr. Qasim sent this dress for you. Greetings. Greetings. Thank you so much, 
it is a really good dress. But uncle…
But? Did you not like it? You had sent it, 
so how could I not like it? But uncle. But what child? I was thinking what would I do 
coming to the wedding? I don’t know anyone there. I will get bored there, alone. You people go there comfortably, 
I will stay at home, uncle. Okay, you know no one. Then you should surely come 
to the wedding. If you meet people, 
then you will know them. You will like it there. And a lot of daughters of your age 
are there in the family, I will tell them to take you along. 
They will not let you get bored. Look child, meet people, this way you will like it. If you stay home then I will keep 
on thinking about you. What do you say? Okay, if you say so, 
then I will come along. Yes, and smile. Smile is sign of being thankful. 
Yes, like this. Thank you. 
Come on. What is this? You are crying? You feel like crying seeing your lovers
in someone else’s arms. What are you looking at me 
like that for? I was consoling you. Look, if you want then I can get 
this wedding broken. I know. You know well how to break marriages. It is something you know like 
the back of your hand. I think you remember your time. You know that cousin of mine, Nabeel, he is really happy nowadays. He is married. In fact, now he will be the father 
of a child soon, too. You are a really cheap man. I am not cheap. If I was cheap, then I would have 
replied to your slap right at that time. I am an imbecile. An imbecile, surely shows his true colours. He turns back and attacks. Listen. Hey… She got upset. Ramsha. Child, is everything fine? 
Why are you sitting alone like this? Uncle, there are so many people, my heart was worried, 
that is why I came here. Are you feeling alright? Yes, yes, I am fine. 
Don’t worry. There are so many guests, 
you give them time. I am fine. Okay, I will take care of the guests. You too come along. Today my daughter looks really pretty, I have warded off the evil eye from you. Thank you so much, mama. That’s so unfair aunt. You even find your daughter 
to be pretty today, I mean, I don’t look good at all. My nephew is the best. Thank you. Did you people hear it? Huh? Ramsha. Ramsha, where is Rasheeda?
I had kept the ring with her, go and check. Sure. 
Ramsha, see, how good this dress looks on you. Mama, I had told you that this dress would 
look really good on Ramsha. What do you say, Afnan? This dress looks good on Ramsha, right? Err.. Ramsha… Now you will get into useless doubt if he 
praises another girl in the presence of his bride. Why would I doubt, Afnan? Whatever he is like, 
he is in front of me. Right, Afnan? Yes, of course. Brother brought a girl off the streets home. We made him understand a lot, that who brings a girl off the streets like this? But what can we say? We cannot even say anything 
in front of brother… You go and keep all the sweets 
on the stage. Go. This is that girl.
Greetings. Who brother has kept in the home. You people know, brother cares 
a lot about the poor. The dress she is wearing, brother has got for her. 
It is a really expensive dress. I had even told brother that there are so many clothes of Alizeh, that she doesn’t wear anymore. Give them to her, she will wear them. But no, brother didn’t listen. He got her such an expensive dress. You people know, these poor people are not in the habit 
to wear such expensive clothes. Yes, Afsheen, this is really good. Both you brother and 
sister are really good. You not only supported this poor girl, in fact, you even think about her so much. You people are so aware of my habit. I cannot see someone else’s sorrow. You people sit, I will come. Thank you people so much that 
you came to the wedding, you took out so much time. Brother is the cleric here? No, the wedding registrar is here. I will lead Afnan’s wedding myself. See, what could be better than this 
if the father leads his son’s wedding and just like that the son leads 
the father’s funeral. You should have this much knowledge 
of the religion. So, if you allow, then should we start? Brother, you said something good. 
I pray to God everyone thinks this. Amen. 
May God give you life. Come on. 
We will take their permission. Come, Mr. Registrar. Sit, son. Alizeh Ahmed, daughter of Nisar Ahmed, we are marrying you to Afnan Ali, son of Qasim Ali, with a wedding gift of five hundred 
thousand rupees. Do we have your permission? Yes, you have my permissions. Madam Ramsha. God be kind. Madam Ramsha. Madam Ramsha. Madam Ramsha. Madam Ramsha. What is the matter, Ramsha? How did you faint? 
Are you feeling okay? Okay, you are fine, child?
 Let’s go to the doctor? No uncle, I just want to go home. I feel really restless, 
I feel my heart will stop. God be kind. Okay, lets go to the doctor. 
Ask the driver to take out the car. No, uncle, I don’t want to go 
to the doctor. Please send me home. 
I feel restless. There are a lot of people here. I will go home and rest, 
I will be fine. You please have the car placed, 
I will go home. Brother, I think I will ask the driver 
to drop her home. You do one thing, send Tabassum 
home with her. Okay? Yes, fine. I will go check on the driver. Child, careful. Careful.
Rest your back. Rest your back. Here, have water. Calmly. That’s it. That’s it. I am surprised. I had thought that the bride really 
feels shy on her wedding night, she doesn’t look in her groom’s eyes. But here, everything is the opposite. You are really casual, 
you are going to change, and you are not feeling shy at all. I tried a lot to feel shy like a 
newlywed bride, but I wont be able to do this Afnan. We have spent so much time 
with each other, that I have no shame or 
hesitation towards you. And if you wanted such a shy girl, then you should have married 
someone else. By the way, Afnan. 
Yes? Tell me something. 
Ask? Have you loved some other girl 
other than me? I mean, we are humans, we can love anyone. We cannot control that. What is wrong with you? Is this the time to ask these questions? Afnan, tell me. Did you ever love any other girl? No. No. I have not thought about any other girl
apart from you. As far as love is concerned, I have only loved you. Only you. Are you speaking the truth? You have never loved any other girl? What is wrong with you? I am speaking the truth and 
today is our special night, so I thought… This? When did you buy this? The thing is that, just because we are cousins, it doesn’t mean I will share 
all my secrets with you. After all, had I told you I am buying 
this beautiful ring for you, then it wouldn’t have remained 
a surprise for you. How do you like it? It is really beautiful. Not more than you. Ramsha. Afnan. Have a seat. You… Where is my gift? Madam, these flowers I got for you
are your gift. This?
Yes. I don’t want flowers, 
they will die till tomorrow. Oh wow, there is something. You are really logical at times. These flowers will die till tomorrow. Fine, then, your gift is due on me. Hey, listen, where did you get these bangles from? 
They are really good. The bangles are made of glass. Yes, so what if they are made of glass, 
they look good. I am surprised. 
Who likes glass bangles? I really like bangles in the wrists of girls, but they look really special in your wrist. My mama and papa want 
to get me married. Your marriage?
Yes. But why? What is the hurry? Make them understand, tell them, you want to resume your education, so you cannot get married right now. I am tired of making them understand. Those people are not willing 
to listen to me. Okay relax, don’t stress so much so easily. You tell them that you want to be 
a girl from today’s time. A girl who is strong, independent, 
who is well educated, who can stand on her own feet. I am sure they will agree. Oh God. which test am I stuck in? Greetings. Hey, Ramsha, child, why are you 
standing here right now? And why are your eyes swollen? 
It feels like you have not slept all night. How can I sleep uncle?
I don’t feel sleepy. I stay up all night long. The peace has left my life. You pray to God, right? You are really religious. You pray to God that 
He gives me peace. God, answers all your prayers, right? May God make better decisions for you. But this thing that you are saying to me, say this to God. He knows it all. He listens to everyone. You pray, He will also listen to you. Me? I am a sinner. I have committed a lot of sins, how can I pray for myself? You pray for me, God will surely 
answer your prayers. You will pray, right? You know, God lives in a broken heart, and the cry of a broken heart is a prayer. You know, have you ever thought 
why you don’t find peace? Because you too, like me, 
believe in God, but you don’t listen to God. You know we ask God to make us
 capable of walking the right path. Oh God show us the straight path, right? When any person, any servant of God seeks forgiveness 
with a true heart, their mistakes and sins are washed away. You know how?
Like we wash clothes well, or how we wash the dishes with ashes
or some detergent or powder, the same way the tears in your eyes, wash away all the stains. If God sees two tears 
in the eyes of someone and they offer prayers with it, 
then God forgives them. Are you speaking the truth? Hey, yes, Allama Muhammad Iqbal says, God picked up your tears 
considering them pearls, they were just tears. What does this mean? Tears of embarrassment. God has blessed you with this wealth, pray that God also blesses me with it. Live long. These tears are proof of a prayer 
getting answered. They are the receipt of a prayer 
being answered. Present it to God, He really likes these tears. Live long. Oh my God, you are really forgiving. You are really forgiving. It is really hard for me 
to take care of myself, but nothing is difficult. You asks for something to be done, 
and it gets done. My God, for the sake of your beloved Prophet (P.B.U.H), you help me. Forgive my sins. I know I have committed a lot of sins. I have been disobedient to you, 
I didn’t listen to You. I know I am a sinner. 
I have made a lot of mistakes, forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me, God. 
Forgive me. Amen. Amen.
