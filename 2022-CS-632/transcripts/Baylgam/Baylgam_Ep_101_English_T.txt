[35.64] Ramsha,
[38.20] I have asked Jamshed to bring
all your stuff here
[42.24] but let me know if there is anything left,
I will get it.
[47.96] Yes, there is something left.
[54.68] Really?
[58.48] What is left?
[63.60] Your love.
[87.80] The love for which you took me
to that house,
[105.00] I want that love and respect
from you Afnan
[108.48] that you promised to give me for life.
[145.08] Umm,
[148.12] I...
[151.80] I am going out with Alizeh.
[164.36] You can have food,
I will have it outside.
[205.16] Afnan?
[215.48] Afnan, come quickly.
[238.64] Yes, come let’s go.
[241.00] How do I look?
[243.44] You look very nice.
[251.20] Does this color suit me?
[253.88] Yes, it suits you a lot.
[265.00] Actually Afnan, we are going out
together after so long
[268.40] so I thought of wearing something
you would like.
[273.40] That is what you have always done,
[276.04] you have always cared about
what I like and dislike.
[288.00] You are a very good wife.
[299.92] Shall we leave,
aren’t you getting late now?
[301.84] Let’s go.
Let’s go.
[381.56] Did you like it?
[383.72] Hmm.
[384.80] I have my doctor’s appointment tomorrow,
will you come along?
[389.04] Do one thing, get an appointment and
let me know I will come from the office.
[393.44] Okay I will do that.
[395.84] Umm Alizeh, you must go
and rest now,
[405.52] I will come in a while.
[408.64] Why?
[410.56] Where are you going?
[421.44] To Ramsha?
[425.20] Yes, Alizeh,
[433.60] I have to look after her as well.
[440.96] Let me go check 
if she has slept or not.
[446.00] Afnan, we were just together,
[448.08] we spent such good time, 
now why are you going?
[450.20] You are still worried about her. 
Alizey,
[453.04] it is obligatory on me 
to care about her,
[461.36] she is my wife,
[463.52] my responsibility,
[471.96] if I won’t fulfill my responsibilities today,
[475.08] I will have to answer to God tomorrow.
[487.60] You go and rest for a while, 
I will come.
[522.44] You know what is the problem 
with women like you?
[526.16] When your husband is doing 
something unlawful,
[530.64] it doesn't make any difference to you
[536.92] but when they lawfully accepts 
someone and marry them,
[541.60] you women have an objection on that,
[548.56] it doesn’t get up to your standards.
[554.72] What are your standards?
[558.20] That pathetic girl?
[560.24] That TikToker who eloped 
from her house?
[561.96] Enough!
[566.40] Don’t say a word after that, Alizey.
[573.80] My colleagues have called me 
so many times just to ask,
[577.36] after all what has Afnan done to you?
[582.20] What should I tell everyone about 
your nephew’s doings?
[587.00] I will be the one facing trouble if I go,
[589.60] everyone will have just one question,
[591.92] why did Afnan marry a TikToker 
and left such a good wife?
[597.76] Enough Alizey,
[599.60] people act very innocent but 
they are not that innocent from within,
[605.60] they know everything and 
they even know
[608.20] that such girls trap honorable boys 
and marry them.
[614.84] And Alizey, you are not the first wife
[617.64] there are thousands of such wives 
going through the same trial.
[624.96] How dare you even step 
into this house?
[629.48] I have brought her here.
[633.84] She will not live in this house,
[635.08] she will get out of here, 
get out of here!
[636.44] Alizey, Alizey, what is wrong with you?
 Control yourself.
[642.84] please I don’t want more chaos
in this house.
[646.12] Whatever you want to say, 
say it to me,
[650.68] I have brought Ramsha here.
[653.32] I don’t want to talk about anything,
[658.16] if she will live in this house, 
I won’t live here.
[662.72] I am leaving.
[716.56] Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys
[720.84] who are family-oriented and rich too,
[723.80] they marry them
[729.36] and that is what Ramsha did too.
[736.84] You are honorable, family-oriented, 
and rich too,
[743.60] she married you and defamed you
[750.24] and then she got famous overnight
[756.24] because that is what she wanted.
[769.24] I loved you so much, Ramsha
[772.60] and I still do,
[775.72] I wish you wouldn’t have 
disgraced my love.
[780.52] It is true that I am unable to take out 
love for you from my heart even if I want to.
[794.60] I wish you would have been 
the way I thought of you.
[802.64] Ramsha, I wish you were actually 
so peaceful and innocent as you seem.
[815.64] I loved you more than myself
[819.36] and I always will.
[871.92] Umm, son, you go wait downstairs, 
I will be there, go.
[884.44] Greetings.
[885.80] Greetings,
[887.96] why have you come here?
[889.28] We stopped you from coming here.
[891.72] I just came to ask how 
Ramsha was doing.
[901.68] I found out she is not well 
so I was worried.
[906.04] Whatever it is,
[907.32] if you had to ask about her wellbeing, 
you could have called,
[909.84] there was no reason for you
to come here.
[912.36] If Afnan has mistakenly 
married Ramsha,
[915.12] it doesn’t mean you are our relative,
[918.92] after all, we have a status,
[920.88] you should think before coming here.
[922.60] Aunt, how are you talking 
to my aunt?
[931.72] Now you will tell me what should 
I talk with whom?
[941.24] Guests that come home are respected 
as honorable people,
[944.64] they are not insulted.
[955.60] Ramsha, listen to me very carefully,
[963.68] any of your relatives won’t come 
to my house now.
[972.72] Why?
[974.36] I am Afnan’s wife, I have full rights
 to this house,
[983.72] and that is why, my relatives will
definitely come here.
[992.24] Aunt, come with me.
[1012.40] Listen,
[1015.12] Afnan is not home right now,
[1018.00] it is better that you leave this house.
[1026.72] If you don’t leave,
[1028.68] I will hold your hand and drag you 
out of this house
[1040.40] and trust me
[1042.24] there is no one is this house 
who can stop me.
[1045.84] You cannot take me out of this house,
[1048.32] I am leaving this house myself,
[1050.08] not just because you want me to leave,
[1052.68] but because I don’t want to live 
in this house.
[1056.00] Lower your tone when you talk to me.
[1064.76] I guess you are forgetting 
your position in this house.
[1075.88] When I will prove you to be the culprit,
[1078.36] the stains on my character will only 
be removed then
[1080.76] and both of you won’t be able to save 
yourselves from the drops of it.
[1086.08] I am leaving this house,
[1088.12] I am leaving this house Alizey,
[1090.84] but I will definitely come back 
to this house,
[1092.80] and I will prove that the trust and 
belief uncle had on me,
[1097.04] I never jeopardized it.
[1101.40] You and your mother have 
tried to defame me,
[1107.12] I will prove it wrong at any cost.
[1111.72] And I am not responsible 
for Uncle’s death,
[1116.32] both of you are, I will definitely 
prove that.
[1123.68] I suggest you throw her out 
of this house.
[1132.40] I cannot do that,
[1136.48] my hands are tied,
[1140.44] my hands are tied to the promise 
Dad made me do it when he was dying,
[1148.32] he gave me the responsibility of 
taking care of Ramsha always.
[1163.60] You try to make Alizey understand,
[1169.76] I cannot break the promise 
I made to dad.
[1206.24] My child, if I had any idea that
[1209.48] Afsheen wouldn’t like that I came here,
I would have never come here at all.
[1214.40] I am sorry on her behalf but,
[1216.56] you forget all this, let it go.
[1223.68] Tell me how is uncle
[1227.04] and what about the shop?
[1229.20] Your uncle is fine,
[1231.84] he has added new articles 
to the shop.
[1242.12] Your uncle and Shani are both 
busy with that.
[1254.52] Just pray that shop starts running 
like before.
[1257.64] Everything will get fine, 
if God wills.
[1259.72] Tell me, you will at least have tea, 
right?
[1261.92] No, daughter,
[1264.60] okay tell me,
[1268.52] are you happy?
[1285.44] And does Afnan take care fo you?
[1287.52] Yes, aunt.
[1289.76] I am very happy,
[1296.08] thank God,
[1297.88] Afnan takes very good care of me
[1300.68] and he loves me a lot too.
[1304.20] God has willed.
[1311.28] Alizey and Afsheen do bother you,
 right?
[1326.72] Thank God,
[1328.16] Afnan takes care of you.
[1341.72] It’s great,
[1343.72] my child, if you have support 
from your husband,
[1355.16] a woman can face the worst of storms.
[1359.64] Thank God.
[1361.92] My daughter.
[1365.92] Tell me about Annie?
[1368.28] Annie misses you a lot.
[1429.20] Look Afnan, I am telling you all this
[1432.24] because when people will see, 
what will they think?
[1435.08] Obviously they will talk,
[1437.56] and Shani is not just Ramsha’s cousin
[1441.40] but he was also her ex-husband.
[1450.32] Look there have been a lot 
of stories already
[1453.68] now I don’t want anyone to create 
issues regarding this girl.
[1465.80] More than half of the world knows
 your wife,
[1477.36] there is a huge issue made 
out of every little thing.
[1480.76] Don’t worry, Aunt, 
I will talk to Ramsha.
[1483.56] There is no need to talk, 
make her understand,
[1486.60] there is no need for her to fulfill 
relationships with them now,
[1498.12] who never gave her support,
[1500.08] love or owned her
[1511.12] and that ill-mannered Shani,
[1512.88] I don’t like that guy at all.
[1526.12] Did you forget him?
[1527.68] Did you see his attitude after marriage?
[1537.68] And how he misbehaved 
so much with brother,
[1549.56] you can forget all this, 
I cannot, Afnan.
[1610.04] You are a very feelingless man,
[1612.68] you will regret a lot.
[1613.92] Hey, get out of here,
[1617.56] I have no regrets.
[1619.72] Come on, son, get lost, come on.
[1625.84] I used to think you were a 
very intelligent man
[1630.24] but you turned out to be 
the number 1 fool,
[1636.16] you even forget how living with 
Ramsha can be so beneficial for you.
[1639.04] What benefit does she bring to me?
[1669.00] Take it.
[1671.08] Keep it there.
[1677.20] Did someone come today?
[1679.56] Yes, Aunt came.
[1682.76] Okay and anyone else?
[1687.04] No, no one else came,
[1689.44] aunt was telling that
[1691.20] Annie has taken admission somewhere,
she is learning to stitch
[1697.60] that is why she went there 
so Aunt came alone.
[1700.16] okay,
[1701.92] do one thing, think again,
[1708.20] no one else came along, right?
[1710.24] No Afnan, I told you it was just aunt,
[1713.08] why do you keep on asking 
again and again?
[1714.52] Because you are lying to me.
[1716.52] What do you think
[1718.20] I don’t find out whatever is happening
 in this house?
[1720.96] I know it very well that 
Shani came too,
[1722.96] why did he come?
[1724.08] No, No Afnan, there is nothing like 
that Shani didn’t come here.
[1730.80] Aunt was saying that uncle or Shani 
might come to pick her up,
[1734.44] Shani might have come 
to pick her up,
[1736.48] I didn’t see him,
[1737.96] and he didn’t come in front of me.
[1739.48] Listen to me very carefully,
[1742.20] I don’t want to see Shani 
in this house now,
[1745.24] else I won’t show any courtesy
[1746.80] and do let everyone in that house 
know as well.
[1762.60] Yes, come let’s go.
[1764.80] How do I look?
[1767.20] You look very nice.
[1771.64] Does this color suit me?
[1774.20] Yes, it suits you a lot.
[1780.40] Actually Afnan, we are going out 
together after so long
[1783.96] so I thought of wearing something 
you would like.
[1788.48] That is what you have always done,
[1791.20] you have always cared about 
what I like and dislike.
[1798.52] You are a very good wife.
[1804.20] Shall we leave, 
aren’t you getting late now?
[1806.12] Let’s go. 
Let’s go.
[1809.96] Ramsha, my child, people who agrees
to God’s choice stay very happy,
[1818.80] who agree to His choice,
[1822.04] have higher ranks,
[1825.40] there is better in everything that 
God does, He agrees to it.
[1830.24] if you agree with Him, 
your heart stay in peace,
[1835.32] by the grace of God.
[1841.72] Who teaches all this to you, Uncle?
[1846.20] God is the greatest.
[1849.68] I used to think like you as well,
[1852.84] like you get random thoughts, 
we become miser,
[1856.76] if we don’t have things of our choice,
heart starts to feel low.
[1870.56] Why didn’t it happen like this,
[1872.08] what I wanted, 
why didn’t that happen?
[1881.12] Then I just got the company 
of religious people
[1885.72] and then I took small steps towards 
religion and started learning gradually,
[1897.76] there are a lot of blessings 
in the knowledge of religion.
