Shahnaz. Shahnaz. Yes, madam? I made this juice for Ramsha, 
please make her drink it. But in front of your eyes. I have made it with a lot of love. You know she gets involved in work, then she becomes careless, 
she will forget. Make her drink it 
in front of your eyes. Yes, madam. Listen, where are you going? To madam Ramsha’s room. Are you going to give this juice? Yes. You never think of taking care of me, you always act good to Ramsha
 day and night. I too had asked you for juice, 
where is it? Madam Alizay, I will give this
to madam Ramsha, then I will make it for you too. Not at all. Give this to me, I will drink it. 
Make another one for her. Bashir. 
Yes, madam? Tell Jamshed to take out the car. Yes, madam. Mama, Ramsha has snatched 
Afnan from me. She has snatched my Afnan from me. Why are you saying these things? What is the matter? 
Did Afnan say something to you? He said nothing. But Afnan wants a son, if that Ramsha gives him a son, then my importance will end, mama. Because I will have a daughter. Then what will happen to me and
 my daughter, mama? What will I do? Afnan will leave me. I will have no importance, mama. My love, don’t think that. Nothing like that will happen. No matter how much I act strong, 
no matter how much I feel I can do everything, 
but I cannot live without Afnan. I cannot live without him. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Alizay. mama, something is happening to me. Alizay, what happened? What happened, Alizay?
Ramsha. Yes. 
Ramsha, I have severe pain. Okay, get up. Get up. Ramsha, I…
get up. Get up. I cannot 
Get up. Get up. Get up. Come here, sit on the bed. 
What happened, Alizay? What? I have severe pain. 
Careful. Careful. Careful. Sit here. Sit here. Alizay, nothing will happen to you. 
You are absolutely fine, Alizay. Mama. Alizay, don’t worry. 
I will just call Afnan, I will call aunt. 
We will go to the hospital. Alizay, don’t lose hope like this, 
please. Nothing will happen, 
you are fine, Alizay. Oh God, what is happening with me? I am with you, Alizay. Nothing will happen. Don’t worry. I will go call aunt. 
Wait, I am coming, okay? Don’t worry, please. Mama. Ouch. Mama. She is really unwell, I feel we will 
have to take her to the hospital. Alizay, get up. Get up. 
I will die. Get up. Get up. Get up. Careful. Careful. 
Ramsha, I… Careful, Alizay, we are going 
to the hospital. Don’t worry. The driver is outside. Alizay,
 get a grip on yourself. Alizay. Ramsha. What happened to Alizay? 
How is she feeling now? I don’t know, the doctors are not 
letting me meet her. But seeing her, I cannot say 
she is well. Afnan, she was in a lot of pain. And I have been calling you for so long,
why don’t you pick up your call? I had a really important meeting. There were no signals there, 
so we couldn’t talk. I don’t know, Afnan, 
my heart is really worried. She was in a lot of pain, 
I feel something… Something is not right. You please ask the doctor 
what happened and you pray that she gets fine, Afnan. Don’t worry, I will talk to the doctor. God, give Alizay health. Shahnaz. Shahnaz. Madam, little madam is 
in the hospital. We were calling you
but you didn’t answer. Yes, I think the phone was on silent,
I was a little busy as well. What happened to Ramsha? Madam Ramsha is absolutely fine, madam Alizay got unwell suddenly. Madam Ramsha took her 
to the hospital. What? Alizay became unwell? What happened to her? I don’t know, 
she was suffering in pain. She was not well at all. What nonsense is this? How can Alizay be unwell? Tell me what happened to her. I don’t know. She had taken a high dose, because of which we couldn’t 
save her child. But you thank God that your 
daughter’s life has been saved. If she was not brought here on time, then it would have become really difficult
for us to save both the mother and child. Right now, I am prescribing 
some medication. Give her this medication for a week. What are you saying? Child, I didn’t know that you will drink that juice 
instead of Ramsha. Alizay, I made a big mistake. This is not a mistake. How can you call this a mistake? You have committed a big sin. You stay away from me. How can you do this with 
your own child, mama? No, child. I am your daughter. You murdered your daughter’s child. Why did you do all this? What was the need for you
 to do all this? Alizay, whatever I did, 
I did it in your love. I cannot see your tears, child. No. I felt that I will do all this and 
maybe you will come near Afnan and that girl would get distanced 
from Afnan. Whatever I did child, 
I did in your love. I admit, I committed a big sin. Forgive me. Please. Whatever is happening with me is right. This should have happened with me. What did I not do with Ramsha? This is what I did with her. I tried to snatch her happiness. And today, you see, my happiness were snatched 
at my mother’s hands. No child, don’t say that. What they say is right. Mama, whatever is happening 
with me is karma. Whatever I did with Ramsha, 
today the same is happening with me. I had considered that girl 
so wrong, mama, but still she was good to me. She took me to the hospital. I am alive because of her today. Or else I would have died. My own mother tried her best to kill me. No Alizay, please. Please, child. Mama, leave from here. Right now I cannot even feel 
the sorrow and pain you are going through right now, Alizay. The sorrow of losing your child, 
as a mother. No one can understand this 
more than you right now. You have lost a part of you. I am sure God must have thought 
of something else, that is better. Right now, I want to scream and 
cry loudly, and express my sorrow, but, this sorrow is there, when you hold the hands of your own. What is the test in which 
we have been put in. I am sure, Alizay… I am sure that God must have thought 
of something much better for us. Today, He took away one happiness 
from us, He will give us a lot of happiness 
in return. No Afnan. Afnan… Hadi is saying that I want to go 
my elder mama. Hadi is saying that his elder mama 
still hasn’t taken him in his arms. I have told Hadi’s father that I will rest from now on and now his elder mama will 
take care of him. Look at him, Hadi is so restless to come to you. To me? What did you think? If you don’t come to meet Hadi, 
then will he not come to meet you, either? Look at him, 
he came to you himself. Take him. Hold him. Me? Yes. Only a mother cares for their child, and both of us are his mother, Alizay. Just like Hadi is my son, 
he is also your son. Like I am his mother, you too are his mother. And only a mother brings up 
their child, that is why both of us will bring up
Hadi together. He is also your son. The same way, like he is my son. From today, you are his elder mama, and I am his younger mama. Okay, Hadi? Ramsha, I am sorry, I… I did really bad…
Nothing bad. Don’t repeat anything 
from the past today. Don’t mention any complaints 
or grievances. I have no complaints 
or grievances from you. Today is a day of happiness. Look, Alizay, the relation between us is 
that of a co-wife. I admit that we can never be sisters, but we can be good friend, right? Alizay, is it necessary that we base this relation on the basis 
of tolerance? We can also fulfill it. We can also fulfill this relation. Fulfilling is much better than tolerating. See, he is sleeping so peacefully.
