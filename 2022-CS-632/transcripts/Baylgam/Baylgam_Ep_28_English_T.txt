[21.60] People are right,
[24.88] when the shade of the father is removed 
from the head of the children,
[29.20] then the world even takes away
the right to live.
[33.08] Okay child, you don’t say anything.
[37.64] Isn’t this injustice mama.
[39.60] Hey, child I know it is injustice.
[46.88] But see, let me talk.
[48.80] What if you talk and things get out of hand 
instead of getting sorted.
[52.52] You just don’t say anything.
[88.52] Sajid always wished that 
Ramsha progresses.
[93.64] Forgive me sister in law,
[95.76] you might find what I say bitter, 
but this is the truth.
[105.52] If Ramsha had to study further, 
she wouldn’t do all this.
[113.16] After all, sister in law,
[115.80] the girls who want to study, 
they just study
[120.80] and they don’t do anything else.
[125.32] If the child sets out on the wrong path,
[129.40] then the child is not blame 
for it completely,
[133.64] in fact, even the parents are at fault.
[142.72] Maybe I couldn’t bring up 
my daughter the way
[148.16] she should have been brought up.
[160.12] We put restrictions on our children,
[164.52] but we are unable to explain the difference 
between good and bad to them.
[171.36] That is why they don’t have 
the realization of right and wrong.
[178.24] Because of our restrictions, 
they are misled about us.
[182.32] You can say what you want, 
sister in law.
[185.28] But the reality is that
[188.40] because of Ramsha’s disobedience
[190.56] we have already been insulted 
enough in the neighbourhood.
[198.88] Forgive me, I am alone now,
[203.84] I cannot take any further risk.
[207.24] What else should she do?
[209.72] She is not getting married,
[212.20] you wont let her study,
[215.56] so my daughter stays at home,
 hear people taunt her
[218.36] and she becomes a mental patient. 
Do you want this?
[227.72] I am still alive.
[230.32] I am her mother.
[233.56] I will decide what is right for her.
[240.76] And I hopeyou...
[244.16] you will at least let your brother’s widow 
peacefully in her mourning.
[256.52] Ramsha will study further,
[260.36] Ramsha will go to university 
from tomorrow
[263.36] and this is my final decision.
[316.68] My cousin Nabeel,
[318.24] she almost got married to her.
[322.36] She almost got married, meaning?
[324.72] Think that they didn’t get married.
[327.00] Why?
[328.08] Right at the wedding day, 
in fact, at the wedding time,
[331.96] I saw that girl.
[337.76] I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
[339.48] I told my aunt and cousin 
that girl’s entire history.
[343.44] In fact, think that I showed them 
all her videos.
[354.36] Actually, my maternal side 
of the family are proper,
[357.56] they are really far from this social media,
[360.56] those poor things didn’t know.
[376.52] Hey, you broke off a girl’s marriage,
[380.08] and you ruined her happy life and
you are asking me why I dislike it?
[384.80] Think, Wahaj, think,
[386.52] if your own sister was in Ramsha’s place
[389.20] and some man did something 
so cheap with her,
[391.52] then what would you have done?
[392.80] Look, mind what you say.
[395.04] The daughters and daughter in laws
 of our home
[397.28] don’t do such cheap things.
[398.80] What is cheap in what she did? 
What has she done?
[401.64] If there is something like that,
 you marry her.
[406.64] We bring such a girl to our home.
[470.96] Where? Outside?
Yes.
[472.48] No Afnan, you know I am not interested
in getting drenched in the rain.
[475.40] Come on, Alizay,
[476.92] this is the first rain of the season.
[478.72] There is no rain beautiful than this.
[480.84] Getting drenched in it has its own fun,
like Ramsha says…
[487.92] Who Ramsha?
[492.16] Ramsha, she is an employee
in my office.
[494.56] Newly hired.
[495.88] She was saying it one day 
so I remember. But leave her.
[525.44] Salma. Salma, I am telling you,
[528.44] this beloved sister in law of yours
 will regret it.
[533.56] She will cry with tears and then 
there will be no one to wipe her tears.
[537.08] She has given her daughter such a 
free hand. Remember this.
[542.40] Hey, whether she regrets or 
does good or does bad,
[548.04] why do you care?
[550.12] It is a matter between her 
and her daughter.
[551.88] Why are you burning your blood? 
Let them be.
[554.84] What are you saying? Huh?
[559.04] Who knows them?
[561.12] The world knows me.
[563.16] The world will say things to me.
[565.80] He couldn’t take care of his widow 
sister in law and orphan niece.
[568.84] He couldn’t take their responsibility. 
Who knows them?
[571.92] Yes so say that they don’t listen to me.
[575.92] After all, who in today’s time 
listens to anyone,
[578.64] they do what they want.
[581.12] You said it so easily,
[583.56] like I will say it and this damned world 
will believe me.
[588.64] I am telling you,
[590.72] I want to leave looking at what the 
environment of the home has become.
[597.24] Where are you going bare footed?
[598.68] You people have made me mad.
[615.24] How can Anwar say this?
[617.96] He is always upset with my daughter.
[623.88] Yes, mama, you called me?
Yes, child.
[627.08] Here is your mobile, keep it.
[631.44] No, there is no need for that, mama.
[637.68] You keep it.
[639.08] I have your phone, if I need to, 
I will use your phone.
[644.24] Now you will go to university,
[647.12] you will need it, child.
[655.56] After all, I will be at ease.
[659.08] If you get late,
[661.64] I will get worried.
[663.24] At least, I will be able to talk to you.
Here you go.
[682.64] Ramsha,
[685.44] things are not good or bad,
[688.32] in fact the good or bad use of it 
is in a person’s hands.
[700.04] Keep it.
[710.12] Thank you, mama.
[744.84] Afnan called?
[779.40] Ramsha,
[781.36] things are not good or bad, child.
[783.92] In fact, the good or bad use of it
is in a person’s hands.
[809.56] Thank God Fahad you came today
[811.52] or else I thought that you would 
make an excuse even today.
[813.80] Had Alizay asked me, 
I would have ignored her,
[816.24] but it is not possible that I ignore you.
[819.40] Did you see, mama?
[821.00] He is always making excuses.
He always makes excuses.
[824.84] No see, I called him, and he came.
[830.68] I am surprised that he came on 
one call from you
[833.00] or he always has an excuse ready 
with him all the time.
[837.52] Man, look, I have come as a guest
 at your home.
[840.64] And if you don’t know then 
get a lecture from uncle,
[844.48] how you give respect to a guest, 
how you treat them.
[848.56] Yes, yes, if the guest is like you,
[851.20] then this is how you respect them.
[856.04] Thank you.
[857.36] You people sit, I will change and come.
[860.36] Fahad, your cousin designs 
such good clothes,
[863.80] make me meet her some time
[865.80] No issue in that.
[867.16] You tell me whenever you have time, 
I will take you.
[873.20] Hey Afnan, come. 
See, Fahad is here.
[876.60] Come on.
[909.24] Greetings aunt.
[910.52] Greetings.
[912.84] Brother, long time.
[918.04] Fahad, you sit,
[919.56] I will get food served and 
you will not go without eating.
[922.52] You people chat.
Sure.
[925.52] Why did you come here?
[929.44] Look, I don’t need your permission 
nor your friendship to come to this home.
[935.96] I know you well and 
also your double standards.
[941.44] You are the one who has double standards,
[943.32] you were shaking your hand 
in front of aunt just for show.
[946.64] Oh, please…
[948.04] Okay, leave it, man.
[949.92] After all this anger doesn’t suit men.
[952.48] Come on, let’s have food.
[954.04] No, what does this mean?
[955.28] No man, what had to happen, 
happened. Come on.
[961.24] No need to say anything.
[964.32] Tell sister in law
[966.28] that she will get what she needs.
[971.72] Uncle, we need money.
[974.52] The money from the shop.
[980.56] After all,
[982.48] it doesn’t sound nice to ask you 
for everything again and again.
[991.48] Since papa has passed away,
[993.40] we have not got any money from 
the shop till now.
[999.08] When you are getting everything 
you need before asking for it,
[1007.84] then what is the need for the money.
[1010.48] A person has other needs 
apart from things.
[1018.20] I want money for me.
[1019.64] I have to pay the university fees.
[1023.36] hear me clearly, girl,
[1029.84] I don’t have any money for your university
and its fees.
[1037.24] I am not asking you for your money.
[1046.16] I am asking for the share in the shop, 
that papa owned.
[1051.44] This means you are asking me for 
the accounts of the shop?
[1058.84] From me?
[1060.60] Right now, I didn’t come with this intention.
[1063.32] But if I ask for the accounts,
 so what is wrong in that?
[1070.52] Because that shop is my father’s.
[1077.40] And I have full right to know where 
the money earned from it is being spent.
[1084.56] Listen, girl,
[1089.48] that shop was your father’s,
it is no more.
[1096.92] And it was means, it was.
[1102.44] I am taking care of that shop now.
[1105.72] So, I am the owner of that shop.
[1110.40] I think you are forgetting
[1113.36] that if you are doing a job there,
[1115.96] then you are also taking payment for it.
[1118.52] And doing a job somewhere doesn’t 
make you own that home.
[1122.68] So it would be better that 
you give us our right.
[1165.84] Did you see? That little girl,
[1169.24] who was born in front of me,
[1171.32] my blood is asking me for 
the accounts of the shop.
[1174.28] And all this is happening because of you. 
Because of you.
[1177.24] What did I do, Anwar? 
I didn’t ask her to do all this.
[1180.72] You surprise me Salma,
[1182.84] you are still taking her side.
[1185.12] Did you see the result of you taking her side?
[1187.32] It was me stupid
[1189.56] who was dying in the love of my 
widow sister in law and orphan niece.
[1193.20] But not anymore, I am telling you.
[1195.40] Not anymore.
[1196.72] Now I will talk to sister in law myself, 
and I will do it right now.
[1199.04] Hey, no Anwar, you stop, please.
[1201.80] You don’t talk to her about anything.
[1203.92] Sister in law is in mourning right now 
and she is unwell too.
[1206.92] God forbid, she gets unwell 
cause of what you say,
[1209.80] then will we be run with her 
to the hospital?
[1212.36] So what do I do? 
What do I do?
[1214.92] Should I shoot up my BP?
[1218.00] If she is in her mourning, then 
she should stay in it peacefully.
[1221.20] And she should control her daughter.
[1223.96] Ill-mannered, she is interfering 
in everything.
[1226.44] Okay, you calm down.
[1228.60] I will talk to sister in law after finding 
the right opportunity.
[1231.20] You don’t do it.
[1232.44] Because if sister in law, tells someone 
or someone finds out,
[1236.04] then what will people say? 
They will call us bad,
[1238.24] they won’t say anything to her.
[1241.24] Annie.
[1242.92] Annie, child, make good tea 
for your father.
[1246.20] I am telling you Salma,
[1248.28] I will not tolerate it anymore.
[1252.16] She is in mourning.
[1261.80] Sister in law, you know 
the condition nowadays.
[1266.80] Anwar was telling me that
[1268.56] the shop doesn’t earn as much as
it used to earlier.
[1273.80] We manage the expenses of the home 
with difficulty in it.
[1277.24] And if you and I don’t understand it, 
who will?
[1282.12] I have to pay Ramsha’s fees.
[1287.96] You tell Ramsha to be patient 
for two to four days.
[1296.32] As soon as we will get money,
[1297.92] I will get you her fees first.
[1300.84] But sister in law, you know 
this shop is so old.
[1306.68] We would even face profit or loss at the time 
when brother Sajid was there,
[1310.92] and nowadays the situation is such.
[1318.16] Every business is at a stand still
[1321.44] and every person is worried.
[1326.56] Okay fine, I will tell Ramsha.
[1332.48] But next week is the last day 
for her fee submission.
[1335.68] Arrange the money for the fees 
in a day or two.
[1339.64] Okay. Okay,
[1341.80] I will ask for it. Don’t worry.
[1353.48] People are right,
[1356.80] when the shade of the father is removed
from the head of the children,
[1360.88] then the world even takes away 
the right to live.
[1364.72] Okay child, you don’t say anything.
[1367.68] I will talk to Shani myself.
[1372.52] Isn’t this injustice mama.
[1374.44] Hey, child I know it is injustice.
[1377.56] But see, let me talk.
[1379.28] What if you talk and things get out 
of hand instead of getting sorted.
[1382.76] You just don’t say anything.
[1386.20] You can say what you want, sister in law.
[1389.52] But the reality is that
[1392.60] because of Ramsha’s disobedience
[1394.48] we have already been insulted 
enough in the neighbourhood.
[1397.96] Forgive me,
[1400.28] I am alone now,
[1402.92] I cannot take any further risk.
[1407.28] Uncle, we need money.
[1410.04] The money from the shop.
[1412.08] After all,
[1413.80] it doesn’t sound nice to ask you 
for everything again and again.
[1417.92] Since papa has passed away,
[1419.52] we have not got any money 
from the shop till now.
[1425.16] When you are getting everything 
you need before asking for it,
[1430.64] then what is the need for the money.
[1432.84] A person has other needs apart from things.
[1435.92] I want money for me. I have to pay
the university fees.
[1441.08] hear me clearly, girl,
[1444.36] I don’t have any money for 
your university and its fees.
[1458.88] I am not asking you for your money.
[1461.68] I am asking for the share in the shop, 
that papa owned.
[1466.96] This means you are asking me for 
the accounts of the shop?
[1474.24] From me?
[1475.56] Right now, I didn’t come with
this intention.
[1478.76] But if I ask for the accounts, 
so what is wrong in that?
[1482.16] Because that shop is my father’s.
[1485.72] And I have full right to know where 
the money earned from it is being spent.
[1491.28] She is not getting married,
[1493.84] you won’t let her study,
[1495.92] so my daughter stays at home, 
hear people taunt her
[1498.68] and she becomes a mental patient. 
Do you want this?
[1501.36] I am still alive.
[1503.68] I am her mother.
[1505.16] I will decide what is right for her.
[1507.48] And I hope you...
[1510.00] you will at least let your brother’s widow 
peacefully in her mourning.
[1516.44] Ramsha will study further,
[1518.28] Ramsha will go to university 
from tomorrow
[1521.28] and this is my final decision.
[1533.64] What is the matter?
[1535.92] What are you thinking?
[1539.48] Nothing.
[1543.80] Where is Shani? 
Is he back?
[1547.00] Shani is back, he must be in his room. 
Why? Do you want something?
[1584.72] Yes, Shani.
[1586.44] Yes, papa?
[1588.60] You should have told me, 
I would have come.
[1590.72] Why?
[1592.24] Can I not come to your room?
[1596.28] You can come,
[1598.40] but you don’t usually comes, 
so I thought…
[1600.84] No, that…
[1603.28] sit.
[1605.96] Hey, sit, man. Sit.
[1610.16] I just wanted to talk to you 
about something important.
[1614.72] Yes.
[1617.60] Shani, I want that you get married.
[1620.60] I get married?
[1623.04] You had said that first 
Annie will get married,
[1625.52] then you will think about me.
[1627.96] Yes,
[1630.44] the situation was such back then,
[1633.04] now I want that you get married
[1638.36] and I want that you marry Ramsha.
[1642.40] Ramsha?
[1645.04] Papa.
[1646.44] Why?
[1649.08] What happened? Huh?
[1651.76] Ramsha.
[1697.64] Sister in law, nowadays, 
there is so much load-shedding,
[1701.24] because of which even the work 
at the shop is suffering,
[1706.64] and then the inflation.
[1710.12] Obviously, the earning will be impacted.
[1714.84] Anwar was saying that
[1716.92] it is just me who is taking the shop 
forward with difficulty.
[1721.88] That is fine, Salma.
[1724.08] The load-shedding was also there
 when Sajid was alive.
[1727.80] He never let me reduce my expenses.
[1731.44] Sister in law, do you know?
[1733.16] Shani and Anwar were telling me that 
the government has implemented some taxes too.
[1737.12] Now tell me, should we pay taxes,
[1739.60] pay the electricity bill, what else do 
we do in this inflation?
[1742.28] Obviously, the earning will get impacted.
[1745.20] And we are still able to manage the kitchen 
in the earning of the shop.
[1748.12] We should thank God.
[1750.44] Salma, I am also have to pay 
the fees for Ramsha,
[1754.88] and there are some expenses at home too.
[1757.56] By the way, sister in law, you sent Ramsha
to the university for no reason.
[1781.92] Uncle became my father 
to raise his hand at me,
[1786.92] and when it is about my expenses, 
uncle refused.
[1791.12] Lower your voice, for God’s sake.
[1793.20] If Anwar hears it, all hell will break loose.
[1796.84] After all, child, we are not his responsibility.
[1800.92] If he is fulfilling our needs,
[1803.52] then we should be thankful for it.
[1805.56] Thankful for what, mama?
[1810.08] That shop is my father’s
[1811.72] and if the money earned from it 
being spent on us,
[1814.00] then he is not doing us a favour, 
it is our right.
[1821.56] After all,
[1822.96] how do I accept that when papa was there 
that shop was doing well,
[1826.76] and a few months after papa left, 
there is no work at that shop.
[1829.60] How is this possible, mama?
[1833.56] Child, I am thinking
[1836.12] I will take a further loan from sister Safia.
[1839.44] No mama, you will not take a loan 
from anyone.
[1844.04] How long will you take loans 
from how many people?
[1846.20] This is a monthly thing.
[1847.52] If you continue to take a loan every month, 
how will you return it?
[1852.88] I have decided,
[1855.00] I will do a job.
[1856.56] What?
[1858.60] You will do a job?
[1860.24] Yes, mama, I will have to do something.
[1868.08] Because I cannot let your and my life 
dependent on uncle at all.
[1876.20] After all,
[1877.52] the money and jewellery we had was 
spent on papa’s illness.
[1885.92] We will have to do something.
[1887.56] We cannot live like this dependent 
on them.
[1890.08] But…
[1900.92] God.
[1910.84] What is wrong?
[1913.76] Why are you looking at me like that?
[1916.56] What is so impossible about what I said?
[1919.40] Anwar, it is impossible.
[1923.04] You don’t like Ramsha in any way,
[1926.68] so now you are telling me that
[1929.16] I talk to sister in law about Ramsha 
and Shani’s wedding.
[1933.72] I doubt your mental condition.
[1937.92] What are you trying to say?
[1939.76] I have gone mad?
[1941.92] I am saying delusional things?
[1946.92] Listen to me, Salma.
[1950.84] Whatever I am saying,
[1953.00] I am saying it after thinking hard.
[1957.36] The situation has been created,
[1959.08] the insults we have faced
cause of Ramsha,
[1962.04] now we will not get a proposal for her,
[1971.76] and in this situation
[1973.52] if we don’t help them, then 
who will help her. Tell me.
[1977.28] But Anwar, you don’t like Ramsha.
[1980.80] You are stuck on the same thing.
[1984.28] If I don’t like her, what does that mean?
[1986.88] I should leave her to suffer 
in front of the world?
[1993.12] No.
[1994.40] I cannot do that.
[1997.12] She is the entrustment of my brother,
[1999.28] she is the daughter of my late brother,
[2002.32] taking care of her is my responsibility.
[2008.24] And you just do one thing,
[2011.12] you talk to sister in law. I am sure,
sister in law will not say no.
[2016.36] Hey, there is no reason to say no.
[2019.12] The amount of insult she has faced,
should be thankful to us,
[2022.68] that despite this situation,
[2024.68] we are willing to marry our son to her.
[2033.20] Do you understand?
[2038.40] Talk to her.
[2055.40] Yes.
[2057.64] Okay fine, mama. I will be back 
in a while, don’t worry.
[2061.16] Okay, goodbye.
[2063.24] Miss Ramsha. 
Yes?
[2064.80] Come on. 
I should come?
[2070.00] This way.
[2084.52] Hmmm.
[2092.76] I think I know you.
[2096.56] I have seen you.
[2100.80] Sir, my graduation is still not complete,
[2104.88] but I want to do a job.
[2107.12] Actually, I have done my diploma
in web designing
[2110.36] and you can check, 
my typing speed is really good.
[2114.16] You yourself are really good too.
[2124.64] You are the same one, right?
[2127.00] Shopping girl?
[2132.64] The one who is really active 
on social media.
[2136.04] I was active. Not anymore.
[2145.56] Sir, you check my papers, 
I want that…
[2149.28] Hey, leave the papers.
[2152.60] I need a personal secretary.
[2161.72] I think you are perfect for that job.
[2168.48] Okay, but what work will I have to do in it?
[2172.84] I mean, what will be my job?
[2176.56] Your job?
[2179.28] Hmmm.
[2181.92] When I come to the office, then,
[2187.48] ask me for tea or coffee,
[2198.76] taking care of me.
[2204.08] Talking to me.
[2211.48] And rest you are smart yourself.
