[20.68] Have you gone mad? 
Have you lost your mind, Shani?
[24.40] I didn’t ask them for money staying 
in that home, and I will ask for it now?
[28.20] Don’t even think about it.
[29.48] Hey, it was different earlier. 
Now you are married,
[32.40] the responsibilities increase after marriage,
the expenses increase.
[36.20] I am your responsibility,
 Shani, not his.
[38.88] Why will he give us money?
[40.48] You know, this is the limit. 
The limit.
[43.24] I took you to the restaurant, 
I fed you food,
[45.72] I took you for an outing and 
you cannot do this much for me?
[50.12] Shani,
[52.20] I thought you did all this 
for my happiness.
[55.36] You did all this to ask me 
for a favour?
[57.60] Okay listen, I don’t want to
 get into this.
[60.72] It is simple.
[61.96] You will go to their home tomorrow 
and bring money, okay?
[65.80] You have gone completely mad.
[67.40] Neither will I got him,
[69.16] nor will I ask them for money.
[70.76] So, you can do what you want. Don’t…
[73.80] Ramsha, you are making me get angry,
[76.28] and you know when I get angry, 
I become really dangerous.
[79.96] Shani, it hurts, and you can do 
what you want.
[82.20] I won’t be scared of your threats. 
Are you mad?
[84.40] Inside!
Shani, what are you doing?
[85.92] Go inside.
[86.76] What are you doing, Shani? 
Don’t be mad.
[89.00] Open the door. 
Aunt. Aunt.
[92.08] Open the door.
[93.88] Aunt.
[95.20] What is this noise? 
What happened?
[97.16] Mama, that’s Ramsha’s voice, 
it is coming from brother’s room.
[100.76] Come on, let’s see. 
Shani,
[103.40] open the door. 
What is this nonsense, Shani?
[105.76] Hey, Shani, what are you doing?
[107.44] No one will open the door for her,
till I come back.
[109.96] No, Shani give me the keys.
[111.72] Don’t do this. 
Why are you doing this?
[113.56] Mama, I will show her 
what stubbornness is.
[115.88] She shows me stubbornness.
[117.08] No, Shani. 
Move back.
[118.20] Shani. Shani, 
what are you doing?
[143.00] She is locked somewhere in the store.
[144.88] Child, he took the keys with him.
[147.92] I will do something. 
You call your father.
[150.40] Call him and ask him to come quickly. 
Yes.
[151.92] Child, we are coming. 
We are coming.
[189.24] Shani. Aunt.
[191.56] Aunt, please open the door.
I feel suffocated here aunt.
[194.56] Aunt, it is really hot here.
[197.08] Aunt. Shani.
[200.68] Shani, please open the door. Shani,
[203.40] I feel suffocated here,
[205.88] please open the door.
[209.88] Please open the door. God.
[223.48] Did you talk to your father?
[225.16] No mama, his phone is off.
[227.76] Oh God, what do I do now?
[230.16] It is so hot, and I don’t know why 
we had a power failure.
[232.60] God knows what the child must be 
going through in there.
[234.52] Call Shani. Call Shani’s number 
and make me talk to him.
[237.04] Okay.
[251.60] Even brother in not answering.
[252.96] Oh God, what do I do now?
[254.88] Tell me, we are sweating badly 
in this heat,
[257.72] then what will be the condition of 
the child that is locked in that room.
[263.12] What do I do? I don’t understand. 
This is my mistake.
[266.12] This is my mistake. I should have 
slapped Shani twice
[268.92] and taken the keys of the room.
[270.48] How was I to know he would go out of 
the home for so long.
[273.64] You are right.
[275.24] Even I couldn’t imagine brother would 
do something like this with Ramsha.
[278.56] Okay, you call your father and 
bring me my scarf till then.
[282.88] Where are you going?
[284.12] I will go check on Shani, he must be 
sitting at a nearby tea stall.
[288.52] Look, if we sit here and wait for him,
[291.12] then he will not come home till night.
[293.00] God forbid, if something happens to 
poor Ramsha in this suffocation and heat,
[298.08] then what will be say to our late sister-in-law,
our late brother.
[302.00] What will we say to them 
on the day of judgement?
[305.04] That we let him do this to their 
poor daughter? Go bring my scarf.
[307.52] I will bring it.
[339.00] Who is here at this time? 
I am coming. I am coming.
[343.04] Hey, I am coming. Who is it?
 Greetings.
[346.84] Greetings.
[348.44] Were you going somewhere?
[350.44] No. Yes, actually, I was going 
to get vegetables.
[353.88] Did you come alone?
[355.40] No, no, Afnan is also there, 
he is parking the car.
[357.88] Actually, he couldn’t find parking here.
[360.16] Okay, he will come after parking. 
You come on, come.
[387.32] What was the need to bring all this?
[391.32] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[394.16] We didn’t need it,
[395.72] I thought these things would 
come in use of you.
[403.88] What is wrong, aunt? 
Why are you saying these things?
[408.48] I feel really hot, 
when will the power be restored.
[412.40] We have had a power failure 
for long.
[423.76] Don’t you have a generator?
[438.84] I am asking you something.
[442.24] Did you say something to me?
[444.64] Don’t you have a generator?
[454.52] No, it has broken down.
[466.72] You please call Ramsha,
[468.40] we didn’t come here for that long. 
We will just meet her and leave.
[471.72] Hey,
[475.52] wow, wow, this is really good.
[479.16] Today, you people have come
at a good time.
[481.88] Did you come to meet Ramsha?
[484.24] Obviously, or else why would we 
come here?
[496.84] Go, open the door.
[499.64] What? I open the door. Yes, 
I will just open the door for her.
[518.76] Right now, let me meet my in-laws.
[532.60] You please call Ramsha, 
after that we will leave.
[536.36] Ramsha is locked in the room upstairs.
[555.32] What are you saying?
[556.88] Yes,
[558.68] she had started to speak a lot nowadays.
[568.88] So, I thought I would find a solution.
[581.96] That is why I locked her in the room 
upstairs, what else?
[600.20] But now that you people are here, 
I will go get her. Okay?
[611.48] I will come. Okay? I will bring her.
[615.24] Offer them some tea.
[616.76] I will just come. Tea…
[653.80] Surprise.
[660.12] No one is here.
[662.80] Let me call Afnan.
[697.16] Tabassum.
[698.84] Yes, madam?
[699.88] I don’t see anyone, where is everyone?
[703.48] Elder sir took his medication 
and went to sleep.
[705.64] Madam Afsheen and sir Afnan 
went to madam Ramsha’s home.
[711.28] Fine, you can go.
[728.16] Come on, drink water. 
Drink some. Come on.
[767.08] Drink some water.
[768.88] That’s it, I am fine.
[771.96] Are you in your senses, Shani?
[783.60] Does anyone treat their wife like this?
[797.24] Whose wife is she? Mine, right?
[800.44] So, I don’t understand why are you
 being so sympathetic towards her.
[819.76] She is my wife,
[821.64] I will do what I want.
[831.72] If she is your wife, then consider her
 your wife.
[835.20] Don’t treat her like an animal.
[851.72] If she doesn’t listen to you, then 
make her understand with love.
[855.80] Locking her in the room is not right.
[876.52] God forbid, had something happened 
to her, then?
[879.04] Yes, so what?
[881.36] At max, she would have died.
[884.96] Everyone has to die.
[915.00] But what I don’t understand is this,
[917.16] that why are you sympathizing 
with her so much?
[934.20] Afnan, be quiet.
[936.64] It is a matter between husband and wife, 
why do you need to interfere?
[950.80] Yes, see.
[952.72] If someone is smart in your home,
[955.36] then that is her.
[965.24] This man is not worthy enough
that you stay with him.
[991.72] You come with us, now you will not
stay here even for a minute.
[994.24] Afnan,
[997.04] this is my home.
[1002.80] Shani is my husband. 
I will not go anywhere.
[1027.16] And this is our personal matter,
[1029.96] it would be better that you don’t speak
in our personal matter.
[1058.84] Fine.
[1071.92] Afnan.
[1074.36] Hey. 
hey.
[1075.60] Hey, at least have tea before leaving.
[1158.52] Afnan, whatever has happened today,
[1161.24] try that brother doesn’t find out.
[1163.64] You know brother’s blood pressure 
is so high
[1170.84] and after all, he is really sensitive 
in Ramsha’s matter.
[1176.28] I don’t believe it.
[1181.12] Shani can do something 
so cheap with Ramsha.
[1187.60] Now leave it.
[1188.84] There is no point in worrying about this.
[1194.92] You see yourself, Ramsha said it in front of
you that this is her personal matter,
[1202.96] so it is better that we don’t interfere.
[1206.80] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[1213.04] Actually, you are right,
[1215.04] we have no right to interfere in 
someone’s private and personal life.
[1219.00] We should never do it.
[1225.80] No matter how much pain and suffering 
the other person is going through.
[1236.28] But won’t this be selfishness?
[1241.80] Have you not seen the condition 
in which Ramsha is living.
[1244.60] The pain she is in.
[1250.56] and you want that I don’t support her 
in this condition,
[1253.76] I stay away from this matter.
[1255.84] So, what do I do, Afnan? You tell me.
[1262.96] The decision to marry Shani 
was Ramsha’s own.
[1265.92] Absolutely wrong.
[1270.12] You and I both know well the amount 
of pressure Ramsha was in.
[1274.24] The situation around her became such
[1277.28] and Alizeh has a fault in all this.
[1283.20] If Alizeh had acted smartly then,
[1286.04] then Ramsha wouldn’t have had to
take this step.
[1288.92] Anyway, there is no point 
in talking about his.
[1291.28] Because we are crying over spilt milk.
[1293.64] You are absolutely right.
[1295.16] Actually, I should listen to you.
[1300.52] There is no point, because helping 
someone in their pain is something
[1304.08] which people with hearts can do,
[1308.60] and we don’t have a heart.
[1312.20] Okay, tell me something, Afnan.
[1318.72] This argument you are doing with me,
[1321.60] will this change Ramsha’s life?
[1331.96] Or Shani’s behaviour will improve?
[1335.52] Then only does this argument 
make sense,
[1342.44] and if not,
[1344.12] then there is no point in this argument.
[1351.24] Look Afnan,
[1352.92] these things happen in small areas 
on a daily basis,
[1363.28] and you know the maid I have called,
[1365.68] her husband beats her daily.
[1372.48] Now these things are unbelievable for us,
[1375.48] but it is daily routine for them.
[1384.00] Okay Afnan, okay relax.
[1385.76] You don’t worry,
[1389.72] I will talk to Ramsha’s aunt to make 
Shani understand.
[1399.28] Okay, fine.
[1448.96] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1452.84] Dad, I am so sorry. 
I know you are not well,
[1455.56] but these are some important papers, 
I needed your signatures on them.
[1458.68] No, I am fine. 
Nothing has happened.
[1461.68] I have it. I have it.
[1470.72] I spoke to Mr. Mehtab,
[1473.76] he will send his son tomorrow. 
Okay.
[1477.72] You meet him,
[1483.32] and tell Mr. Mehtab that he should get
the contract tomorrow
[1486.12] and if possible, sign it too.
[1489.08] Absolutely right, dad. 
Here you go.
[1494.04] Hey
[1497.28] Afsheen, you didn’t tell me, 
you went to Ramsha’s home.
[1511.28] How is she? How was she? 
Is she fine?
[1515.00] Dad, that…
Yes, yes, brother,
[1517.28] she is absolutely fine.
[1520.60] I took everything you asked me to.
[1524.52] You did good.
[1530.76] In fact, her aunt was even saying 
what is the need to bring so many things.
[1541.44] I feel his aunt is a very sophisticated 
and gracious lady.
[1553.36] Yes, Ramsha was telling me 
her aunt really cares for her.
[1573.44] Afsheen, I was saying that
[1576.12] you visit once or twice in a month 
or two to Ramsha’s home.
[1584.32] Yes, sure.
[1596.00] So that she realizes that 
she is part of our family,
[1600.04] we have not forgotten her, okay?
[1648.28] Ramsha, I am thinking 
I will change my bike.
[1651.20] It is bothering me a lot.
[1653.40] But won’t a new bike be really expensive,
Shani?
[1658.28] It is expensive, but it is expensive for us,
[1661.96] but if Mr. Qasim gets it, then…
[1665.28] Are you in your senses?
Why would I take money from him?
[1668.20] I never took money while staying 
at his house then why would I ask now?
[1672.28] Don’t even think about it.
[1673.68] You know, this is the limit. 
The limit.
[1676.64] I took you to the restaurant, 
I fed you food,
[1679.04] I took you for an outing and 
you cannot do this much for me?
[1684.64] I thought you did all this 
for my happiness.
[1687.68] You did all this to ask me for a favour?
[1690.92] Okay listen, 
I don’t want to get into this.
[1693.72] It is simple.
[1695.08] You will go to their home tomorrow 
and bring money, okay?
[1699.00] You have gone completely mad.
[1700.36] Neither will I got him,
nor will I ask them for money.
[1703.72] So, you can do what you want. 
Don’t…
[1706.72] Ramsha, you are making me get angry, 
and you know
[1710.16] when I get angry, 
I become really dangerous.
[1713.00] Shani, it hurts, 
and you can do what you want.
[1715.12] I won’t be scared of your threats. 
Are you mad?
[1717.44] Inside!
Shani, what are you doing?
[1718.88] Go inside.
[1719.96] What are you doing, Shani?
[1728.52] Just once.
[1730.68] You just say to me once that 
you don’t want to get married,
[1733.40] I will support you. 
I will stand by you…
[1735.76] What is wrong with you Afnan?
[1738.00] What are you saying?
[1739.80] Why are you torturing and hurting me.
[1744.16] It is really late anyway,
[1746.68] if it gets further late then I will get 
humiliated again because of you.
[1750.32] I will not let anything like this happen.
[1752.08] I promise you.
[1754.20] You speak the truth once.
[1756.48] Be strong and tell me. 
I will stand by you,
[1758.84] Shani won’t be able to say 
anything to you…
[1760.72] What is wrong with you?
[1762.16] Why are you saying these things? 
Why are you hurting me?
[1765.16] Why are you torturing me with 
what you are saying?
[1767.04] Because I want to marry you.
[1824.84] Hello.
[1825.92] Hello.
[1828.84] Can you come to my office? 
I want to meet you.
[1838.56] Yes, I am coming.
[1862.24] Yes, brother Shani.
[1863.20] I am going to do something important.
[1864.88] Okay.
[1865.68] If papa asks then tell him.
[1867.60] Yes, I will tell him.
[1869.68] and this is Mr. Mustafa’s grocery, 
when he comes give it to him.
[1872.28] Okay, I will give it.
[1880.28] Mr. Afnan, see, now you know the inflation,
[1886.44] the shop is not working that well.
[1889.08] This is something to worry about.
[1890.88] Look, I don’t have time to listen
 to your stories.
[1898.60] It would be better that you 
come straight to the point.
[1904.52] See, you said something really smart 
and you are smart.
[1911.88] Obviously, you are running 
such a big business.
[1924.08] You know,
[1927.52] at times I think being rich is a blessing.
[1937.92] I wish I was born in your home,
[1944.60] and all this would have been mine.
[1953.08] Okay, calm down, I am joking.
I am joking.
[1960.28] This is a really bad joke.
[1966.56] Anyway, tell me, what do you want?
[1973.72] Look, the thing Ramsha doesn’t understand,
 even you don’t understand it.
[1981.96] And I am not mad, that I lock up my own wife,
in her own room in the house.
[1993.96] Look, actually, I wanted to buy a new bike.
[1998.12] For that I asked Ramsha to loan 
some money from Mr. Qasim.
[2012.20] What hell would have broken loose 
had she asked him?
[2022.88] Now obviously, if your wife doesn’t 
understand this issue of yours,
[2026.64] it will be a problem. 
Won’t you dislike it?
[2037.12] The same thing happened, and then
the rest is in front of you.
[2045.64] Fine. You need money for the bike,
I will give it to you.
[2054.20] But after that you will never 
bother Ramsha, you won’t worry her.
[2061.56] Mr. Afnan,
[2062.84] that’s what I am trying 
to make you understand,
[2064.48] that I am not mad that 
I torture my wife.
[2074.16] You write it.
[2080.72] I am writing a cheque for you,
[2086.08] but you shouldn’t mention this 
to anyone
[2088.76] that I gave you this money.
[2094.80] How much money do you need?
[2097.84] Make a cheque of one hundred thousand. 
I will return it.
[2101.56] Make it for one hundred thousand.
[2112.20] No need to return the money.
[2121.12] Yes, but in return you can do one thing.
[2130.04] Stop torturing Ramsha.
[2137.28] She is a really good girl.
[2143.00] Only people with good luck 
get such wives.
[2184.88] Answer what I am asking you honestly.
[2188.28] Did aunt force you to marry Shani 
or was it Alizeh.
[2193.04] No one forced me.
[2195.08] You are lying.
[2196.48] Swear and tell me that
you are not lying.
[2199.00] Why should I swear?
[2205.12] Do you even trust me swearing?
[2211.84] I had also sworn to love you and 
sincerity with you too,
[2215.64] you didn’t believe me then,
[2216.92] then why are you asking me 
to swear today?
[2219.00] Don’t punish yourself for my mistakes, 
Ramsha.
[2222.04] Look Afnan,
[2223.52] you are living your life like you want.
[2227.24] Also let me live my life how I want.
[2230.56] Stay away from me.
