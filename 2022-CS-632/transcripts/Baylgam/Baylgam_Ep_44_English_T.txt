[113.28] Thank you.
[117.00] Greetings dad.
Greetings.
[120.36] How are you feeling now?
[122.72] The one who will have such
a caring daughter,
[133.40] tell me, how would he feel?
[135.68] See for yourself, I am fine.
[143.28] I have not done anything in this uncle.
[149.68] I feel more than the medication,
it is your good deeds
[152.84] that are of use to you right now.
[162.64] You recovered so quickly in a few days.
[165.72] God has specially blessed you.
[179.76] Without a doubt, it is God who blesses.
I am just an ordinary man,
[185.08] my good deeds are nothing.
[190.56] He is the one who gives us
the opportunity.
[194.16] Were you going to the office, Afnan?
[196.88] Yes, dad, I am going.
[199.00] I will change in a little while.
[201.04] I had not gone for a few days,
so I thought I would get an update today.
[210.60] You do one thing, you drop Ramsha
to her academy.
[214.40] She has not been going to the academy
for so many days.
[222.52] No uncle,
[223.96] I will join from tomorrow, not today.
[231.72] No, no, child, you don’t take
any more offs,
[234.32] your studies are already suffering.
[235.84] You go and get ready,
[237.84] he too will take some time
to get ready, okay?
[251.36] Yes, yes, dad, I will surely drop her.
[253.84] Get ready.
[255.00] I am going to have breakfast
after getting ready.
[256.72] I am fine. Go, come on, go.
[258.68] You will take care of yourself?
Yes, God is there to take care of me.
[263.52] Fine, then.
Come on, go. Live long.
[265.28] Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[276.84] Thank God.
[287.20] Can I say something, Ramsha?
[291.08] You have changed yourself.
[297.04] Not me,
[299.52] my God changed me.
[313.28] Yes.
[315.76] Seeing you I feel that
God has changed you.
[320.36] Because if I tell you the truth,
[323.28] I don’t believe this is the same Ramsha,
[327.24] who I had seen for the first time
some time back.
[336.36] The one I had known for the first time.
[340.84] That Ramsha was running somewhere
to get something in the race of life.
[356.16] She didn’t care about anyone.
[360.56] She only wanted to fulfill her wishes.
[371.84] Or it would be better if I say that
[375.52] in this hustle and bustle of life,
[379.76] she had gotten so busy, that
she had lost sleep from her life.
[391.12] Maybe she had no peace in her life.
[394.24] You are right.
[401.32] You don’t find peace in yourself.
[405.76] In fact, you get it after connecting
with God.
[416.24] I have understood this,
[419.00] that the stronger you connect the relation
between you and God,
[426.48] the more peace you will find.
[433.60] Do you know?
[435.88] When you love your God,
[441.28] when you strengthen
your relation with Him,
[445.44] then God too loves you.
[453.88] He cares for your love,
[457.24] He doesn’t let you get defamed.
[460.84] And on the other side,
[463.76] if you love a person so much,
[473.40] then they insult and defame you.
[482.32] They don’t care about love,
[486.56] they only bring you shame.
[489.68] You know well, I have suffered
through all of this.
[497.44] You are embarrassing me.
[511.32] No, there is nothing like that.
[514.24] I didn’t mean to do that.
I am really sorry,
[517.64] if you didn’t like it.
[522.80] I was just telling you my experience.
[528.24] Yes, but remember one thing.
[536.36] Whatever happens,
[539.96] there is betterment in it for us.
[544.24] Without a doubt.
[547.00] There is betterment in everything
God does.
[562.40] Thank you.
[584.04] Come in.
[588.12] Little madam.
[589.24] Yes?
Sir is here.
[590.92] He even had flowers in his hands.
[594.16] Really?
[596.44] You go ahead, I will come.
[628.36] Greetings.
Greetings.
[631.04] I was coming to you.
[633.16] Actually, I wanted to…
[634.76] What happened? Is all okay?
Are uncle okay?
[636.84] He is absolutely fine.
[638.12] He is fine and also really happy.
[640.00] Thank God.
This is for you.
[653.04] What was the need for this, Afnan?
[654.84] Why was there no need?
[656.80] You served dad so much,
you cared for him so much.
[664.72] Even if someone his own was
in your place,
[667.04] they wouldn’t have been able
to care for him like this.
[672.92] Because of you dad is healthy today,
he is happy.
[679.00] So I thought I would give you
these flowers to thank you.
[683.44] Thank you, but there was no need
for this, Afnan.
[690.00] Uncle is my well wisher.
[692.36] This is your greatness that you are accepting
that dad has done some favours on you.
[700.16] Or else, today,
[701.92] neither do people accept that someone
did favor on them, nor anyone’s goodness.
[710.56] But I am sure that the good deed
you have done,
[714.60] God will reward you for it.
[717.24] Thank you.
Welcome.
[753.80] Hello.
[756.64] Did you bring something for me?
[760.04] No, did I have to bring something?
[763.00] No, just like that. Anything.
[766.12] Hey, if you wanted anything,
[768.08] you should have told me,
I would have brought it.
[770.96] No, like you had thought of
a surprise or something.
[775.80] Surprise?
[779.48] Is it your birthday?
[781.96] No.
I understand,
[784.16] it is my birthday today, right?
[786.96] No, Afnan.
[788.12] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[789.68] Yes, it must be our wedding anniversary,
right?
[794.12] How can it be our wedding anniversary?
[796.20] We have not been married for a year.
[797.68] Exactly,
[799.48] when there is no occasion
out of the three of these,
[802.04] then what surprise?
[806.28] And what did I have to get?
If you want something,
[808.68] then give me a call.
I will bring it. Yes?
[812.08] I…
[815.40] What happened?
Are you going somewhere?
[819.80] Me? No. Why?
[821.24] No, you still haven’t changed,
you are ready the same way, so…
[826.48] I dressed up for yourself.
[828.20] If you don’t like it, then I will change…
[829.60] Hey, no, when did I say that?
[833.04] You look really pretty.
[835.08] You look really cute. Dress up.
[837.84] Okay listen, I have not met dad,
I will go meet him and come. Okay?
[874.64] Oh God,
[878.20] King of Kings,
[882.28] you give whoever You want an estate,
[886.40] and you snatch it from
whoever You want.
[890.80] You give respect to who You want,
[895.16] and You snatch respect from
whoever you want.
[900.00] Oh God,
[901.28] all the qualities are in Your hands.
[906.04] You control everything.
[910.88] God, the man who insulted
and humiliated me,
[917.40] today You got me respect from him.
[923.64] God, I couldn’t even imagine that
you are so beneficent and kind.
[929.56] God, which favours of Yours
do I thank you for.
[933.68] My really bless your servants, My lord.
[938.16] You really love your servants
more than seventy mothers.
[945.00] Thank you so much, God.
Thank you so much.
[969.84] Alizay,
[973.92] child give me my medication.
[978.56] Yes, uncle. Okay tell me,
[980.64] what medication do you take?
I will bring them.
[982.92] Hey, child I don’t know
what medications I take.
[985.76] Ramsha always gives them to me.
Ask her.
[989.04] Okay, I will ask her.
[990.96] Thank you.
[998.20] Ramsha.
[1000.72] Yes?
[1001.44] Ramsha, tell me, what medication
do we have to give uncle.
[1004.60] In fact, do one thing,
give him his medication yourself.
[1007.24] He has eaten food, he will rest.
[1009.48] Fine, I will give him his medication.
[1036.80] Little madam.
Yes?
[1038.48] Sir is here.
[1039.64] He even had flowers in his hands.
[1042.72] Really?
[1045.12] You go ahead, I will come.
[1064.24] Surprise?
[1068.16] Is it your birthday?
[1070.56] No.
[1071.72] I understand, it is my birthday today,
right?
[1076.00] No, Afnan.
[1077.20] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1078.92] Yes, it must be our wedding anniversary,
right?
[1083.20] How can it be our wedding anniversary?
[1085.20] We have not been married for a year.
Exactly,
[1088.56] when there is no occasion
out of the three of these,
[1091.16] then what surprise?
[1101.16] Yes. Yes.
Thank you very much.
[1103.16] Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[1105.12] Yes, yes, it will reach.
[1106.76] Thank you so much.
Thank you.
[1109.40] Okay. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[1114.04] Shani.
[1115.44] Shani.
[1117.84] Yes, papa?
[1118.76] Listen, Mr. Qasim called.
[1121.96] You have to go his home
in the afternoon tomorrow.
[1124.88] He will give you a cheque,
you have to bring it.
[1128.20] Tomorrow?
yes.
[1129.84] Papa, arrange it for day after tomorrow.
[1131.24] Tomorrow I have to go with Umair
for something important.
[1133.00] What are you saying, man?
[1135.52] Is your work more important than
the work of the shop?
[1140.00] You have to go tomorrow.
[1142.52] Fine, I will see.
[1144.84] You wont see, you have to go tomorrow.
[1148.56] Sure.
[1152.76] What is wrong with this new generation?
[1155.72] For them going around aimlessly
is more important.
[1159.04] He has to go with Umair.
[1165.88] I think my phone ran out of battery.
[1208.20] Did you give flowers to Ramsha?
[1209.88] Hmmm.
[1212.52] What hmm, Afnan?
[1214.56] I am asking you something.
[1217.76] Yes, so I have responded to you.
Why are you asking me again and again?
[1220.64] Why are you talking like this?
[1222.28] Because I can ask you.
[1231.80] I don’t understand
why you are talking like this.
[1240.92] Think yourself,
[1242.80] she took so much care of dad
in his illness.
[1248.64] She didn’t move from next to him
even for a minute.
[1252.00] His medication, his food,
[1258.56] she cared for everything.
[1260.92] I felt I should thank her.
[1263.36] I couldn’t understand anything else,
so I gave her flowers.
[1267.68] Oh, so this is why you gave her flowers.
[1270.84] Yes,
[1272.44] I gave it as a thank you,
there is nothing else in it.
[1276.84] You never gave me flowers.
[1284.32] How many gifts have you given to me
after marriage, Afnan?
[1290.12] Okay fine,
[1291.48] you too want flowers,
I will get them for you.
[1294.00] Happy now?
[1307.36] No, one minute Afnan. I don’t get it.
[1311.64] Earlier you couldn’t tolerate that girl,
[1314.84] you didn’t want to see her face.
[1321.12] Now suddenly you sympathize
with her so much
[1323.80] that you are getting her flowers.
[1335.84] Look Alizay,
[1338.00] I don’t understand
what your problem is actually.
[1346.24] Do you have a problem that
I gave her flowers
[1348.52] or do you have a problem that
I said thank you to her.
[1350.20] I disliked both things, Afnan.
[1355.04] Even ,if that girl served
she didn’t do a favor to us.
[1366.24] Uncle has done a favor on him.
[1368.28] He has kept her in this home,
he gives her food,
[1370.44] he takes care of all her expenses,
he takes care of her educational expense.
[1373.76] Don’t you see all this?
[1375.76] She should thank us,
why are you thanking her?
[1384.44] We are giving her all the luxuries
in this home,
[1387.00] even if she did a little work,
[1389.32] this doesn’t mean we go sit in her feet.
[1394.96] Now you are saying something
wrong, Alizay?
[1396.96] I am not saying the wrong thing, Afnan,
you people are doing wrong.
[1403.64] That girl is not even worthy of sitting
in our feet,
[1407.04] and you are getting her to your heads.
[1408.76] Drag her out of this home
as soon as possible.
[1414.08] Right now, I have to do something important,
so I am going from here.
[1418.04] Afnan, this is not right.
[1419.44] This is not right either.
[1421.52] Afnan, I am talking to you.
[1444.68] You sit, I will call him.
[1468.96] Greetings.
[1471.24] Greetings.
Sit. Sit, son.
[1474.76] All okay?
Thank God.
[1477.24] Papa was saying that you were not well.
[1480.40] How are you fine?
[1481.52] No, thank God, I am better now.
[1483.96] Tell me, is your father fine?
[1486.12] Papa is fine.
[1490.16] Mr. Sajid, is his widow fine?
He has a daughter, right?
[1494.60] Is she fine?
[1496.52] Yes.
[1498.92] He was a good man,
a really good man.
[1502.60] It is God’s will,
everyone has to go one day.
[1505.92] Right now, I am talking to you,
and I see his face.
[1511.00] Yes, that’s how it is.
Whatever God wills.
[1514.28] Okay yes, son did you not have to come
in the evening to get the cheque?
[1518.12] Yes, I had to come in the evening,
[1520.00] but I had some work in the evening,
so I came right now.
[1523.88] Actually, your cheque is with my son,
Afnan
[1527.48] and he has gone out somewhere,
I think to a meeting.
[1530.80] I will do one thing, I will call him.
I will find out from him.
[1553.16] he is not answering his phone,
[1555.80] so we will wait for some time.
[1557.48] Yes, fine.
[1559.92] Do you want to have some cold drink?
[1561.80] No. No. No. Okay, Mr. Qasim,
I was thinking
[1564.72] I will come tomorrow or day
after to get the cheque.
[1568.76] Yes, whatever is easy,
whatever you see fit.
[1571.28] I will come tomorrow or day after.
[1572.52] So, have some cold drink or tea?
No, I will just go. Thank you.
[1575.64] Live long. Thank you.
[1577.44] Apologies you were bothered.
[1660.60] Brother, so much happened and I don’t know.
[1666.60] You have stayed so unwell,
[1668.48] you were admitted in the hospital
and I don’t even know about this.
[1677.68] Let Alizay come,
I will just ask her.
[1680.92] You were so unwell and
she didn’t even tell me.
[1684.72] Hey, don’t say anything to Alizay,
I told her not to.
[1688.00] No brother, you didn’t do right.
[1690.56] You should have at least called me once,
[1692.68] I would have come running.
[1695.04] that’s why I didn’t call you.
[1697.08] I know you well.
[1698.76] You would have left everything
and come.
[1704.56] You went to a function of your in-laws
after so long,
[1708.72] so I thought you attend it comfortably.
[1710.60] See, I am fine, thank God.
[1713.24] Am I not fine or not? Speak up.
[1715.12] Thank God brother,
that you are fine.
[1718.04] I will do charity for you.
[1726.60] Greetings.
[1727.80] Greetings.
[1731.16] Greetings.
[1733.12] Your soup is ready, uncle.
Should I bring it?
[1735.80] Child, you just came from the academy
[1737.92] and you are worried for my soup
as soon as you came.
[1740.16] You should have rested for some time.
[1742.92] Uncle I don’t feel tired at all
going to the academy.
[1749.76] You know, uncle,
I have noticed something.
[1753.00] When I used to go to university,
[1755.24] and come back,
I used to feel really tired.
[1758.80] But since I have started going to
the academy and when I come back home,
[1762.32] I feel really fresh.
[1765.36] Thank God. Child, if you study religion,
[1768.96] then this is its blessing and this is also
the blessing of our religion.
[1775.92] You are absolutely right.
[1778.56] You know, Afsheen,
[1780.52] this child really cared for me.
[1795.28] My medication, my food, I feel
[1799.56] if God had blessed me with a daughter,
[1804.08] then my daughter would have been
like that.
[1813.48] Uncle, I will bring soup for you.
[1824.80] Oh God, you are so stubborn.
[1826.96] If someone talks to me like this,
I wont even see their face.
[1830.20] Man, you need to be a little stubborn
for a healthy lifestyle.
[1837.56] A person stays happy and healthy
because of it.
[1840.20] Pass the cookies.
[1846.36] Golden words by Mr. Fahad.
[1848.88] I will write this down and get it framed.
[1855.40] Okay, tell me, how is everything
in the office?
[1858.72] It is going really good.
[1860.40] In fact, we had a lot of business
this month.
[1863.48] Good.
[1864.84] I wanted to ask you something.
[1870.08] Nowadays, Afnan seems a little off to me.
Why?
[1877.68] Excuse me.
[1879.64] I had to go to the academy.
I just checked, no driver is there.
[1884.20] Will you please call so that
the driver can come?
[1890.72] Ramsha,
[1892.36] is there a time for you
to go to the academy
[1894.88] or do you go to the academy
at any time?
[1903.08] The servants of the home,
are the servants of this home,
[1907.88] they are not your personal assistants.
[1914.92] Actually, today is a special lecture,
[1918.28] that is why I am going to the academy
at this time or else…
[1921.40] Anyway, there is no driver.
[1922.96] If you want go, you can go in a rickshaw
[1928.88] and if you don’t have money for the fare,
then I will give it.
[1932.28] Fine, I will…
You know, I was leaving as well.
[1935.52] Come I will drop you.
[1937.04] No, thank you.
[1947.32] What happened?
[1948.56] Why are you responding so badly?
[1954.32] Your academy is near his home,
he will drop you. Right, Fahad?
[1962.56] No, I will go myself.
[1964.12] Ramsha, go with him. He is right.
[1966.96] When uncle finds out later, another
drama will be created at home.
[1970.16] You drop her.
[1971.24] I will go.
Yes, yes, no issues.
[1973.32] You go with him.
Come on.
[1976.80] Okay Fahad, take care of yourself.
[1978.20] Okay bye.
[1981.76] Alizay, that…
Go.
[2000.32] I didn’t like the way Alizay behaved
with you today.
[2010.40] I had thought Afnan would have
given you respect at his home.
[2019.16] But you are being humiliated
on small things.
[2023.20] So sad.
[2033.84] By the way, I have a solution
for this problem of yours.
[2040.92] If you want,
[2042.84] you can come live at my home.
[2058.72] You keep this offer limited to yourself.
[2061.52] Drive fast, I am getting late.
[2064.76] Your refusal is attracting me
towards you.
[2070.48] I had never given anyone else
the offer to come to my home.
[2082.88] You know, no one else will be at home,
[2086.28] it will just be me and you.
[2088.08] Stop.
[2090.28] Stop the car.
[2091.92] I said stop the car!
[2093.88] I said stop the car!
You won’t stop it? Stop it.
[2095.24] Okay. Okay. One second.
One second. I am stopping it.
[2097.92] Stop the car.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
[2101.56] Ill-mannered, illiterate man.
[2105.76] Where are you going? Wait.
[2116.92] What is wrong with you?
[2118.28] Why are you acting so decent?
I know well…
[2143.08] Afnan.
[2157.04] What was going on?
[2159.24] Alizay had asked me to drop Ramsha
to the academy.
[2167.40] I don’t know what happened to my car.
It is breaking down again and again.
[2176.28] It is good that you came.
[2178.68] Why don’t you drop her?
[2181.24] I will take the car to the mechanic, okay?
