[34.92] Afnan, are you upset with me?
[40.80] No.
[46.88] So then, why are you
not talking to me properly?
[49.92] Why are you ignoring me?
[58.48] Okay, I am sorry,
[60.04] I shouldn’t have doubted you
[69.40] but please don’t get
more upset with me.
[80.00] Why are you quiet?
Say something.
[82.56] When you don’t believe
in anything I say,
[92.44] when there is no trust,
[93.44] what is the point of talking to you?
[103.12] It is way better for me to stay quiet.
[106.56] Afnan, don’t say that,
[109.08] when you get quiet, I get sad.
[123.04] I haven’t cracked any joke,
[124.68] why are you laughing?
[127.48] Yes, but it is no less
than a joke for me.
[141.80] Do you even remember when
was the last time we talked?
[148.48] It is not that Afnan,
[150.24] we almost talk daily.
[153.40] No, Alizeh,
[155.84] that is not called talking,
[158.80] we just fight and argue.
[173.36] Even if we are spending
time with each other,
[176.32] we are just doubting each
other during that time
[179.60] and character-assassinating
each other.
[192.44] I feel that its better
[194.68] that we don’t spend much
time together at all.
[205.28] Anyway,
[208.48] I still don’t want to argue
much with you.
[268.24] Hello,
[269.32] brother Jamshed, where are you?
I am off,
[273.04] you know that my class gets
off early Friday and Saturday,
[277.56] okay fine I will come
by rickshaw on my own.
[280.92] Greetings, Sister,
[282.76] do you study in this academy?
[285.16] yes.
[286.00] Sister, I want to get
my younger sister admitted here,
[288.28] can you guide me?
[290.28] Yes, definitely but
[291.20] the admission office must have
closed at this time,
[293.48] do one thing
[294.80] come between 8 to 10 in the morning
and get her admission done.
[297.40] And what will be the process
of admission here?
[317.12] Alizeh, shall we go to some restaurant
and eat if you are hungry?
[320.80] Hmm, we can eat.
[325.36] My meeting got so
prolonged today that
[328.40] I didn’t get time to have lunch.
[333.64] What happened?
[343.64] That’s Ramsha?
[345.80] Who is Ramsha talking to?
[348.36] I don’t know who that is.
[363.64] Yes, but we should know
[365.08] who is the stranger she is talking to.
[375.60] Hey where are you going?
[378.36] I, umm,
[379.60] I should go and check
[380.64] who is this stranger she is talking to.
[384.96] The way she is talking
[386.32] he doesn’t seem like a stranger,
[388.88] I think you shouldn’t go and interfere.
[402.20] Look, whatever it is,
[403.80] Ramsha is my responsibility,
[406.48] I should know who she is talking to.
[410.12] Afnan, what do we know who is that boy,
[411.88] what does he do?
[412.96] What do you know Ramsha might
not want to tell us about him.
[422.16] Why do you just want to go and
ask her for no reason?
[424.24] Yes, but we must know who it is.
[426.36] Stop Afnan
[427.84] Come home now and then ask,
[429.84] don't you have to ask on the road?
[434.28] It will seem strange
[437.68] Look if you go like this,
[439.36] we don’t know what
she might think,
[440.76] like you are here to do
some investigation,
[442.76] there will be a show in
the street for no reason,
[444.36] people will watch too, let it be,
[445.88] let’s just go home right now.
[510.68] Greetings.
[512.04] Greetings,
[512.76] where are you coming
from at this time?
[514.84] Umm, Academy, where else?
[524.36] Why? Why are you asking like this?
[527.00] Because you got late
while coming back today,
[535.76] I thought I should ask,
[537.04] I got worried.
[539.56] No, no, I didn’t come late.
[546.68] In fact, I have come early today,
[548.00] I come late daily.
[555.48] Anyway, Afnan, I am tired,
[556.80] I will rest for a bit.
[559.00] Hmm,
[560.16] you must be tired, go, rest.
[583.44] I should go and check
[584.60] who is this stranger she is talking to.
[588.76] The way she is talking
[590.24] he doesn’t seem like a stranger,
[592.60] I think you shouldn’t go and interfere.
[600.56] Look, whatever it is,
[602.40] Ramsha is my responsibility,
[605.04] I should know who she is talking to.
[608.52] Afnan, what do we know
who is that boy,
[610.52] what does he do?
[611.56] What do you know Ramsha might
not want to tell us about him.
[618.12] Why do you just want to go and
ask her for no reason?
[620.32] Yes, but we must know who it is.
[622.60] Look if you go like this,
[624.16] we don’t know what
she might think,
[625.40] like you are here to do
some investigation,
[627.72] there will be a show in
the street for no reason,
[629.12] people will watch too, let it be,
[630.76] let’s just go home right now.
[651.52] Afnan?
[657.16] What happened?
You didn’t even change yet
[658.76] and you are still standing here.
[662.72] I am thinking about who was the
guy Ramsha was talking to.
[671.36] Why are you thinking
so much about it?
[674.84] Because usually, she shares
everything with me,
[678.08] she never talked about that guy.
[683.16] Afnan, she must have not told you
[684.76] because you are not
so important to her.
[694.92] It is not important that
she tells you everything,
[702.84] and Ramsha is
a single girl anyway,
[704.92] she might have started
to like someone
[713.00] and she doesn’t want
to tell anyone of us yet.
[715.76] Impossible.
[717.24] Why impossible?
[719.28] Ramsha used to talk to
boys before as well.
[729.76] She even used to talk to you, right?
[738.48] You were a stranger to him as well.
[742.80] Jamshed? Jamshed?
[747.16] Jamshed?
[750.88] Yes, Mr. Afnan?
[752.56] I have strictly asked you to
go pick Ramsha every day,
[755.92] why didn’t you go today?
[758.12] Sir I was going
[759.36] but Madam Ramsha called me and
[761.52] asked me not to come and
she will come on her own.
[783.16] May I go, sir?
[784.00] Go.
[786.20] Do you believe it now?
[839.28] Greetings.
[840.76] Greetings,
[842.04] how are you Ramsha?
[847.20] Who are you?
I didn’t recognize you.
[849.92] Recognizing doesn't take much time,
[852.40] we will talk and get to
know each other.
[865.56] Tell me, how are you?
[868.04] Looks like you are
a very free man,
[870.40] don’t ever call me again!
[877.32] Are you busy?
[878.36] No.
[879.88] No,
[880.52] you were talking on
call with someone.
[882.88] No, no, I am not busy,
[884.92] you had some work?
[885.88] Yes,
[886.96] I didn’t ask you about your
wellbeing for so long,
[889.88] so I thought I should ask today.
[897.52] How are you
[898.28] and how are the classes
of the academy going?
[904.04] Everything is going well by
the grace of God.
[907.96] Did someone come to meet
you at the academy today?
[912.68] No, why?
[915.48] Yes, because
[917.16] I was thinking that your relatives
don’t come to meet you at home,
[927.16] so there is a possibility that
[928.28] any of your relatives came to
meet you at the academy.
[937.88] No one came to meet me Afnan.
[948.80] And I don’t have any relative in
this world now anyway,
[959.16] so someone’s presence and
absence doesn’t make any difference to me.
[974.04] I will go and meet uncle.
[1042.16] hello?
[1043.88] How are you, Ramsha?
[1047.36] I even asked you the other day
to never call again on my number,
[1050.44] so then why are you bothering me?
[1053.28] Ramsha, your voice is so nice,
[1055.40] I just feel like listening
to it all the time.
[1065.72] What happened?
Whose call was it?
[1068.20] No one’s.
[1077.32] I am going to make tea,
do you want to have it?
[1079.72] No.
[1103.96] I think it is a very important call,
you must attend.
[1108.00] No, it is not important.
[1151.60] Ramsha didn’t come?
[1154.00] She must be here anytime.
[1156.28] Didn’t you tell her?
[1158.56] I did tell her but
[1162.40] her long conversations on
the call won’t end,
[1165.68] I have been noticing brother,
[1167.08] I don’t know who she is busy
with on call all the time.
[1179.04] Yes, uncle, did you call me?
[1180.40] Yes, Greetings,
may peace be upon you
[1182.16] Greetings.
[1183.52] My child, the books
you asked me to bring,
[1185.72] I have brought them,
they are in the room.
[1188.28] Thank you, Uncle.
[1189.32] Thank you so much.
[1190.12] Stay blessed.
[1196.76] By the way brother,
[1197.56] it is not good to talk on
call for so long all the time.
[1203.16] The sugar is less in tea.
[1207.16] Shall I get it for you?
[1208.08] No.
[1218.80] Annie, get me the tea
[1220.72] already, I have been
waiting for so long.
[1225.80] Were you making bone broth?
[1226.48] Shani?
[1229.20] Shani?
[1230.20] Hey Ramsha, my child,
[1232.04] what happened, my child? Sit, sit.
[1234.52] I am not here to sit.
[1241.08] Where is your son? Call him.
[1242.68] Annie, go call Shani here.
[1245.08] Umm, why are you so angry?
[1247.68] Shani?
[1248.52] Ramsha, my child,
[1250.12] what happened? What is it?
[1251.68] Like I said,
[1253.00] where is your son? Call him,
[1254.68] I want to talk to him.
[1255.72] What is it? Why are you yelling?
[1257.56] Shani? Talk in a lower tone,
[1259.04] there is no need to yell.
[1261.24] What do you want? Yeah?
[1263.04] Why are you doing all this now?
[1266.20] What did I do?
[1267.96] Who have you given my number to?
[1283.52] I am asking you,
[1284.60] who did you give my number to?
Who did you give it to?
[1287.16] Who did I give your number to?
[1290.00] Don’t try to act like
you don’t know, Shani,
[1292.88] I know you very well.
[1300.20] You have a habit of doing
such pathetic things
[1303.08] and you are the only one
who can do this.
[1306.48] I will not let this move be successful.
[1309.12] Shani, what is Ramsha saying?
[1313.16] I will tell you.
[1316.72] He has given my number
to one of his friends
[1318.68] and now he has been calling
me and bothering me.
[1322.04] You won’t let me live
in peace, right?
[1324.64] You cannot see me happy, right?
[1327.92] Now he has started to do
these disgusting things too.
[1330.64] What do I need to do
all these acts for?
[1332.72] Why would I do this?
[1333.76] Because you don’t want
me to be happy in life,
[1336.16] you cannot see all this.
[1338.80] Look Shani,
[1339.96] I am telling you one last time,
[1341.56] I was tolerating all this till
you were my husband,
[1344.72] I was being courteous towards you
[1346.76] but now I won’t do it.
[1348.40] That is why it will be better
[1349.56] if you stop bothering me else,
[1352.64] I won’t take very long to
complain to the police.
[1357.00] Ramsha, my child, listen
to me, My child.
[1361.72] She is talking weirdly,
[1362.92] I haven’t done any such thing.
[1389.96] Greetings, Dad.
[1390.92] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[1392.96] What happened?
What are you looking for?
[1394.24] Hey, my blood pressure medicine,
[1396.12] Ramsha has kept it somewhere,
[1397.04] I can’t find it.
[1398.76] I don’t know where is it.
[1400.48] okay, don’t worry,
[1402.16] let me call her and ask.
[1403.56] No, I have called her
she is not attending it,
[1412.76] why don’t you do one thing,
[1414.04] call the academy’s number,
here it’s in it.
[1423.88] Take it.
[1425.04] Thank you.
[1437.76] Umm, dad, no one is picking up there.
[1443.24] But don’t worry
[1444.60] I will try again in a while.
[1447.40] yes, do it and ask her where has
she kept the medicine,
[1449.96] I don’t even have the prescription.
[1453.08] Are you feeling well?
[1454.24] I am fine, don’t worry, just ask her.
[1515.44] Greetings, Islamic Academy.
[1517.36] Greetings,
[1518.36] Afnan Qasim here,
[1520.44] please make me talk to Ramsha.
[1522.80] Ramsha?
[1523.80] Tell me her full name?
[1525.40] Ramsha Sajid,
[1526.80] who studies in the level
two of your academy.
[1529.48] Hold on for a second.
[1538.28] Yes, yes, she hasn’t come today,
she is off today.
[1542.44] Really?
[1544.36] Okay, I am really sorry,
[1546.04] actually, I thought she had
come to the academy,
[1548.12] I will call home and check.
[1576.52] Greetings, Afnan.
[1578.72] Greetings.
[1580.08] Where are you, Ramsha?
[1581.28] I am in the academy, Afnan.
[1593.56] Hello? Hello?
[1595.76] Ramsha, you are in the Academy?
[1598.64] I have been calling you for so long,
[1600.24] even dad was calling you,
[1602.12] why weren’t you receiving it?
[1603.60] Actually, I was in the class
[1605.68] so you know I cannot take
a call in the class,
[1607.44] why what has happened?
[1608.48] Is everything all right?
[1609.48] Yes, everything is fine,
[1611.96] I wanted to ask about dad’s medicine,
[1613.92] he has been looking for it for so long,
[1615.32] tell me where have you kept them?
[1616.68] Yes, I have kept Uncle’s medicine
[1618.20] in the second drawer of his side table,
[1620.32] check there.
[1621.84] Okay, thank you.
[1627.92] I had to lie because of this
Shani for no reason,
[1631.20] I cannot even tell Uncle and Afnan,
[1634.52] I don’t want to worry them for me.
[1638.04] I will handle Shani myself.
[1671.28] Ask him,
[1672.64] ask him why is he doing all this?
[1675.32] He just wants to compromise
whatever honor is left.
[1678.80] What am I hearing?
[1685.68] What is this matter?
[1692.56] What is all this that
you are doing?
[1693.68] What do you want?
[1697.12] Dad, I didn’t do anything.
[1703.12] If you didn’t do anything,
[1704.24] is Ramsha lying then?
[1705.68] Yes, she is lying.
[1717.68] She wants to take
revenge from me,
[1719.12] she has come here
and did this drama
[1720.40] and you guys are believing her
[1721.52] and humiliating me instead?
[1729.28] I can’t accept that
you are innocent.
[1739.64] You must have definitely
done something
[1741.84] else what is the need for her to lie?
[1756.36] Tell me honestly Shani,
[1757.64] whom have you given the number?
[1759.32] Who is your friend who
has been bothering her?
[1766.48] Dad I swear to your life,
[1768.00] Mom, I swear to your life,
[1769.12] I haven’t done anything at all.
[1782.44] I am telling you just
[1783.88] wants to degrade me in
front of you guys,
[1786.60] she is angry
[1787.68] and she is taking that out on me,
[1788.64] nothing else.
[1809.76] She wants to take revenge.
[1817.60] I will tell her.
[1867.68] What happened?
Whose call was it?
[1869.84] I don’t know someone
is bothering me,
[1870.96] I am getting calls from an
unknown number again and again.
[1874.64] Okay, give it to me, I will talk.
[1878.68] No Afnan,
[1879.80] I will block it right now,
[1880.92] there is no need to talk.
[1898.84] The way she is talking he
doesn’t seem like a stranger,
[1902.92] I think you shouldn’t go
and interfere.
[1905.12] Look, whatever it is,
[1906.92] Ramsha is my responsibility,
[1909.60] I should know who she is talking to.
[1913.04] Afnan, what do
we know who is that boy,
[1914.84] what does he do?
[1915.96] What do you know Ramsha might
not want to tell us about him.
[1922.64] Why do you just want to go and
ask her for no reason?
[1924.80] Yes, but we must know who it is.
[1927.16] Look if you go like this,
[1928.68] we don’t know what
she might think,
[1929.96] like you are here to do
some investigation,
[1932.20] there will be a show in the
street for no reason,
[1933.56] people will watch too, let it be,
[1935.24] let’s just go home right now.
[1938.76] What happened? Whose call was it?
[1941.36] No one’s.
[1948.12] I am going to make tea,
do you want to have it?
[1950.48] No.
[1965.08] I think it is a very important call,
you must attend.
[1969.24] No, it is not important.
[2012.60] Ramsha Sajid,
[2014.08] who studies in the level
two of your academy.
[2016.64] Hold on for a second.
[2023.32] Yes, yes, she hasn’t come today,
she is off today.
[2027.68] Really?
[2029.48] Okay, I am really sorry,
[2031.24] actually, I thought she had
come to the academy,
[2033.36] I will call home and check.
[2050.36] He has given my number to
one of his friends
[2052.36] and now he has been calling
me and bothering me.
[2055.76] You won’t let me live
in peace, right?
[2058.36] You cannot see me happy, right?
[2061.88] Now he has started to do
these disgusting things too.
[2064.40] What do I need to do
all these acts for?
[2066.40] Why would I do this?
[2067.44] Because you don’t
want me to be happy in life,
[2069.96] you cannot see all this.
[2072.60] Look Shani,
[2073.68] I am telling you one last time,
[2075.24] I was tolerating all this till
you were my husband,
[2078.60] I was being courteous towards you
[2080.44] but now I won’t do it.
[2082.00] That is why it will be better
[2083.28] if you stop bothering me else,
[2086.36] I won’t take very long
to complain to the police.
[2091.56] Shani?
[2095.80] Shani?
[2099.00] Son, where are you going?
[2100.92] Shani?
[2104.40] Don’t know where is he going.
[2133.36] Greetings, sister,
[2134.68] sister, did you recognize me?
[2136.32] I met you two days ago.
[2138.12] Thank you so, so much,
[2141.64] you guided me so well.
[2143.96] Okay, so is her admission done?
[2145.48] Yes, absolutely.
[2146.48] Okay great, that’s awesome. Bye.
[2148.60] Bye.
[2153.24] Who are you,
[2154.68] how do you know her,
what is your relationship
[2156.96] You are talking about Ramsha
[2159.36] Yes, I am talking about Ramsha
[2161.64] What were you talking to her about?
[2163.36] Who are you to ask me?
[2165.64] She is my friend
[2168.00] I'll do whatever I want
[2170.80] What? she is your friend?
[2173.64] Why should I tell you that? 
 she is more than a friend!
[2187.20] Mind your own business,
understood
