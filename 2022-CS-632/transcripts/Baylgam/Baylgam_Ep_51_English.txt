Salma. Hey, Salma. What happened?
How did you come so soon? Hey, the news is such, I had to come early. Madam Afsheen called. She called? Oh, that’s it, she said no, right? I knew it earlier they would say no. Now you got a call. You had tied hopes for no reason. Annie, child, do you know your mother’s
biggest problem? She talks more, thinks less, and she doesn’t listen at all. Refusal is out of question, she has agreed. She said to me that you fix the wedding date, that’s it. I have decided, I will talk to madam Afsheen and decide on the
wedding date soon. Really? You do one thing, call Shani and tell him to bring
sweets on his way back. We will go their place
right now with sweets. Papa is happy like
he won a lottery. Hey, child, my niece is no less than
a lottery for me And you should be happy, your friend is coming back. Chat with her, talk to her,
have fun. Yes, I am really happy. Mama, after Ramsha left,
I have nothing to do at home. I get so bored. Papa, if you are going right now, then I too will come along
with the sweets. Hey, why not child? It is your only brother’s wedding. It is your right, do come along. Hey, how are you planning
things yourself? Ramsha didn’t agree to
the marriage earlier, how did she agree now? Earlier it was different, she had the support
of sister in law. Now she is alone. Everyone must have
made her understand, talked sense into her. Thank God, she came to her senses. You leave everything, bring her phone. My damned phone is not charged. I will call Shani. Bring the phone. Bring your mother’s phone. What are you cooking? I am making vegetables. Hey, today is a day to be happy, add meat to it today. Yes, yes, you people are right. I would say, why delay something good? And actually, Ramsha’s parents’ home,
and in-laws is your home. We just have to perform the ceremony
of sending her off from here. What are you saying, Afsheen? I didn’t just call
Ramsha my daughter, I also considered her
my daughter. The same way a daughter has
a relation with her parents’ home, the same way, she too has
a relation with this home. She can come and go here,
whenever she wants. I made God my witness and called sister Mehnaz, my sister. She is my niece with that relation, so just like it is Alizay’s
uncle’s home, this is Ramsha’s home. Wow. Yes, yes, absolutely. Brother
you are absolutely right. I also meant that. Brother Qasim, this is your
affection and love that you are giving so much respect
to relations made in name or else nowadays people
don’t care about their blood relation, they don’t respect them at all. I would suggest that now that we are sitting together, we should also finalize
the wedding date. Because brother is really
busy because of his business, I don’t know when we will be
able to sit together like this. Yes, yes, why not. Believe me, you snatched
the words from my mouth. As you see fit, decide, and let us know the date,
that’s it. Mama, papa, if you people are talking then can I go meet Ramsha? Yes, yes, do go, she is upstairs. I have to make a phone call, excuse me. You people, please
have something. I am searching for that hero, maybe I find his Facebook
account by luck. Whose? Hey, the same with whom with whose car
I had made a Tik Tok. Him? Yes Annie. What? Annie. Annie, I am really happy. What happened? Annie, I am in love. I am in love with Afnan at first sight. He is so good, so good, hat what do I tell you? When I saw him, he was looking so handsome, so good, he had such amazing dressing, what do I tell you? What did Hania say and go? What fiancé? Oh fiancé. Hani was with me in
the mall yesterday. I met Afnan yesterday. I didn’t understand what
to say to her, so I told her that he is my fiancé. By the way, what is wrong in this?
I am right. What did you talk to Afnan about? My heart is worried. I am getting wrong doubts. Your doubts are absolutely
right, Annie. I didn’t find Afnan. What do you mean you didn’t find him? He didn’t come to meet you? But called him a day in advance. You people had decided a time. Then what happened? Maybe there was
a misunderstanding, and this misunderstanding
took me to him and I didn’t find him. Afnan is Mr. Qasim’s son? This Afnan is the same? I don’t believe it. Yes, Annie. See, where destiny has brought me. This is the same sight
I wanted to run far away from. See where fate has
made me stand today. How can you marry anyone,
Ramsha? You used to love him, right? Afnan is married, Annie. Afnan is married? Yes. To whom? To Alizay. Maybe you would have seen her. Mr. Qasim’s daughter in law, she is Afnan’s wife. When a person’s heart breaks, then he doesn’t stay like before. Boys are like that, I don’t know why girls
don’t understand this. Ramsha really trusted Afnan. First that Afnan left her, then elder mama left the world. Now, she has lost trust in people, that is why she doesn’t
agree to getting married. Afnan? Yes. Afnan. Ramsha loved Afnan a lot, she also wanted to marry him. But her destiny didn’t have
Afnan’s companionship. I made a big mistake, Ramsha. What mistake? Tabassum. Yes, sir? What happened? Have
some guests come over? Yes, sir, madam Ramsha’s
in-laws are here. Ramsha’s in-laws? Who are Ramsha’s in-laws? Madam Afsheen told
me to make tea, madam Ramsha’s in-laws
are here. Fine, you go. Who can be Ramsha’s in-laws? I just quit having sweets
three days ago. Come, Mr. Afnan. Come. What happened? All okay? Give sweets to Mr. Afnan as well. Sweets? But for what? We have fixed the wedding for Shani and Ramsha. Congratulations to you too. Come son, have some sweets. No, thank you so much. Actually, the children of our home
don’t compromise on anything, and Afnan is mostly on a diet. He doesn’t have these sweets. I hope you people didn’t mind. No, no, what is there to mind in this? Every home has their principles, they own ways. We didn’t mind it at all. Ramsha, had
I even known a little, I wouldn’t have told her
anything about you and Afnan. I made a big mistake, forgive me. Annie, don’t apologize. What had to happen,
has happened. I have no complaints from you. All this was written in my fate. Why are you looking
at me like that? I am just seeing that the girl who would make
noise on small things, she has so much
patience now. I have made my life easy
learning the religion. Maybe this is why I am
so satisfied today. You know Annie, I have learned one thing. If we cry on everything, if we get worried, then this doesn’t make a difference. It is better that we learn to
be patient on our worries. And we ask God. Then He will make everything
easy for us. You know, since I have started following religion, my life has become really easy, Annie or else, the path I was on, I would have ruined myself. God has specially blessed me. Ramsha, I don’t believe it,
that you are saying all this. Tell me, the truth Ramsha, are you happy marrying
brother Shani? Why? Are you not happy that I will come to that home
as your sister in law? Huh? I am completely sure that uncle and aunt would have started
shopping for me as well. Right? Annie, do you know, aunt Afsheen got some
clothes for me. You sit, I will show them to you. Excuse me. You? Maybe you didn’t recognize me, I am Ramsha’s cousin, Annie. Oh yes, greetings. How are you? You know, I am disappointed to see you. In fact, I am more sorry
than disappointed. You didn’t care for my sister. Ramsha loved you so much, she was so sincere with you. You didn’t believe her. I know, she was idiotic,
I know she was emotional, but she was crazy after you. Earning money through showbiz, being famous was her passion, but you were more than passion for her. Mr. Afnan, every girl who lives for her desires, who wants to breathe in
open air is not a loafer. Such girls just follow wrong
advice of people, but believe me, them returning is not impossible. But, us? We don’t leave the door
for them to come back. We don’t give them the
chance to come back. And you did the same. You did the same with Ramsha. You didn’t understand Ramsha. What is the matter? Do you want to say something? Yes. What do you want me to get? I am going to the shop right now. Tell me, I will bring it. In fact, write it on a paper, I will bring it. Come on. I don’t want you to
bring something. Then? You will be marrying Ramsha
in a few days, right? She is a really good girl. Her behavior with
everyone is really good. I want you take care of her. So what do you think? I will not take care of her? There is nothing like that. You are a little strict, that is why I said it. Okay, so you are worried for your friend, more than your brother. No brother, nothing like that. I worry for both of you. I want that both of you stay happy. I just said it. You are my younger sister,
stay like a younger sister. Mind your own business,
understand? And prepare for yourself. How do I have to keep Ramsha, where do I have to keep her, that is my matter and I know well what I have to do. No need to act like my mother. I just said it. Come on, leave from here.
Come on. Wait. Hear me out clearly. In future, when Ramsha
comes to this home, then stay away from her,
and mind your own business. And it would be better that
you stay quiet in our matters. Do you understand? What is all this? Ramsha’s aunt came, she brought her wedding gifts. Did you people call me? Yes, your aunt brought
wedding gifts for you. And she has said that she will send the dresses for
the wedding and reception later. So you have a look. Oh please, mama. What is there to see in this? Is this the wedding gift that came? Is this how a wedding gift is? Do you remember, Afnan had
got my wedding gift prepared? He got every single thing
made for my by his choice. Do you remember? All my friends were saying that Afnan looks so happy on my wedding. He got a lot of my things from Europe. And why would he not have gotten it? I am his love and choice, both. Obviously, your wedding
gift was really beautiful. Who didn’t praise it? Now Ramsha’s family, obviously, sent things as per their worth. How can you compare this wedding gift,
with your wedding gift? Hmm Everything is really good. And no matter how expensive
or precious things are, they become useless after use. I will send Tabassum, she will gather all the things.
