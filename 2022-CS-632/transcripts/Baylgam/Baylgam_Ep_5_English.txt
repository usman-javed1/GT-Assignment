Hello?
Hello? There is a limit Afnan, you are such a feelingless person, I called you so many times, 
sent you so many texts, but you didn’t reply even once. Hey Ramsha, it’s not that,
I was busy at that time. Busy? You are always busy, do you even have 
time for me or not? You are so angry? At least listen to me. I called you but you disconnected it. What if I disconnected the call? You could have called me again but no, Mr. Afnan has such ego, 
why would he call me? Dude! When someone disconnects our call.
 It means that they are busy and when someone is busy, we should 
not disturb them again and again. So, I just thought that 
when you will get free, you would call me, and coincidentally, when you called me, I was out somewhere, 
so I couldn’t receive your call. Really? Tell me something, is there any extra tax on calling 
when you go out? There is no extra tax 
but you talk so nicely, I really enjoy listening to you talk, that is why I thought I shouldn’t waste 
such good talk in all this noise, so I didn’t attend the call else you know that I don’t even 
have time to itch. Okay, okay, I have to go out for 
shopping with my friend anyway, and I will call you, 
if you don’t pick up my call, I will not talk to you. 
Okay. Bye. Bye. Okay do one thing, 
send me the pictures and send me the complete details, I will show them to Ramsha’s father, okay? Okay, bye. Whose call was it? I was talking to Rukhsana. Rukhsana who? Rukhsana, the matchmaker, she has recommended a very 
nice proposal for you. What is wrong with you, mom? 
What is all this that you are into? What do you mean? I did tell you that your dad has asked me
to look for a nice match for you and start preparing for your wedding. I thought you and dad must be joking. Oh ho! Tell me something? Does anyone
 joke about all this? yeah? Okay listen, send 2 to 4, in fact, some more pictures of yourself 
on Rukhsana’s WhatsApp, and send the good ones in good clothes. I will do one thing, I will also send you Rukhsana’s number, she will forward the ones she finds appropriate
to send to the respective families. Yeah? Hey, take Rukhsana’s number… Hania? Let’s go in that shop, that one. Hania, enough now, you have shopped so little 
in so many hours, do you know I can complete 
my shopping in this time and by the way, Ainy is not well 
she hasn’t come with, I will have to go home alone. okay, we are just going. Do you want to buy anything, 
then don’t complaint later to me. No, nothing. 
You just hurry up please. Then later… Hania, wait a minute, I am coming, just stay here for a minute,
I will be right back. Hey, where are you… Afnan? Hi? Hello. I’ll call you back. You here? 
Wow what a pleasant surprise, have you come here for shopping? Yes, I came with a friend, 
I told you. What are you doing here? 
You had so much work? So, I am here to do that, 
I have a meeting with a client, I swear there is a meeting, 
I am here for that. You can ship meanwhile, 
are you done shopping? No, I didn’t had to shop, 
my friend had to, she has been shopping so much
 that I am fed up now. You just stay here, I will let her know
and come back in 2 minutes. Don’t go anywhere. 
Hey? I am coming back, wait. 
Hey I have a meeting, I… Hania, you do one thing, you may go I will come back
on my own, okay? Okay but tell me who is he? Him? He is my fiancé. Wow, he is very handsome. Okay, fine, I am going to go with him, you get home and text me, okay? Bye. Take care. Text me when you get home.
Bye. Afnan, I have sent my friend home, 
now we will shop together. You sent her home? 
Yes. And then you will drop me home. You will go with me? 
Yes. Really?
Yes. But this looks so pretty. Hmm. 
But Afnan, tell me something. Hmm?  
Wait. This is such an expensive phone, 
what was the need to get it for me? You keep this back, 
I cannot keep it. You will return the gift? 
It is your birthday gift. I couldn’t buy anything for your birthday
 in a rush the other day, so I felt really bad, and look, 
you do make videos, right? It has a very good video result, 
it will be helpful to you. You are absolutely right. You know my phone was so old,
I was thinking to buy a new one soon, and now you gifted it to me, 
by the way how did you find out? I just find out. It’s a very nice phone, I am thinking to make a lot of TikToks
 from it and selfies too. Listen? Where did you get these bangles from? 
They are very nice. These are just crystal bangles. So, what if they are crystal? That’s a big thing, 
who likes crystal bangles? You like them by the way. I really like bangles in girl’s wrists but they look very special in your hands. Thank you. Then I will wear them 
daily from now on. You know that’s very nice about you, you listen to everything I say and 
implement on it too. But listen it is getting late now, I told the client that I am coming back 
in an hour,shall we leave? Let’s go. 
Come. Alizey, hey dude, I was looking for you 
in the entire house, where were you? What are you doing? I have a meeting with HR tomorrow, 
I am preparing for that. okay. Thank you. Umm, take this. What is this? It has my heart in it. You are acting very poetic today? Mister, I neither understand 
poetic mind nor you, but now I have to live with you all my life. Let's see what happens to me. 
Now look what’s in it. Crystal bangles? You have got them for me? Now I don’t have anyone in my life 
except you that I will get this for. It is for you, wear them, 
it will look very good in your hands. Afnan, you know that 
I don’t have time for all this. hey… how long does it take to wear bangles? Wear them, I have bought them 
with so much love. Afnan, please, I don’t have time for these stupid things, can’t you see that 
I am preparing a presentation? I also have to go in the morning. I don’t know you just pick up 
anything and bring it. So, I shouldn’t be doing a presentation now?
Should I stop working? Okay now let me work now, go. Okay then, I am not holding your hands. Have some? no, no thank you, I don’t feel like 
having it right now. Ramsha, let’s go, Sir Asim’s period is about to start. Ainy, I have just come back from the lab,
let me take breather in peace. By the way, Ramsha, your fiancé is very handsome, do prevent him from evil eye. Okay, I will be right back. I will be right back. okay bye. 
Bye. What did she just say? Who? What did Hania say? 
What Fiancé? Oh fiancé? Umm, she was in the mall 
with me yesterday, so I met Afnan there, now I didn’t know what to say 
so I told her that he is my fiancé. What’s wrong in it by the way?
I said the right thing, no? How many lies will you tell everyone? What is wrong with you Ainy? What of he is not my fiancé today, 
he will be in future. He is such a nice guy by the way, he even loves me and like me too, when I will tell mom and dad about him, 
they will never refuse. What we want, never happens in life. Yes, but whatever I think happens. Okay then end of story. Why should a person talk to you 
when nothing affects you at all? Yeah? So then don’t talk and stay quiet, 
don’t try to be my mother everywhere. Come on go, go and quickly study, 
go attend your class. I won’t go unless you come along. Slacker. 
You. Ramsha, come on now. Wow, what a dress. Hania, you were absolutely right, such modern dresses are 
in trend these days and by the way, I look so pretty in this dress. Oh my God! I will make a lot of videos today. Now just see, I will make such videos that 
they will go viral everywhere. 1 2 3… okay now, one more. Ramsha? Dad, coming, I am coming, 
I am coming. Yes. What is this? Snacks, Uncle got it for you 
but he gave them to me but this has my share too now. And I am telling you that 
I won’t go without having snacks. It is the limit, there is your share in everything 
but Dad bought these? Yes, what did you think? You know I got so scared. Scared? Why? Wait, I will let you know. Look at this Annie, you know I was wearing this dress 
and making TikTok, I heard Dad’s voice all of a sudden 
so I got scared, I quickly went and changed. You, you, you were wearing this? You will wear this and make a video? Yes, so? So? Are you out of your mind? If uncle gets any of your videos, 
you will be in trouble. Are you mad? How will anyone see the video? Dad, Shani, and uncle don’t make TikToks, they don’t use TikToks either and 
don’t use Instagram either, so then who will see it? No one will see it, 
don’t take tension either. But there are 50 other people 
that they know who use it, if someone send the video to uncle then? Your thinking is so useless and nonsense. Nothing like that would happen and by the way, Hania has given me this dress just for a day. You won’t listen, just listen this much that serve snacks to me,
it will get cold. Okay fine, hold this, 
I will quickly get the plates. Okay? Hurry, I want to eat them 
while they are hot. Okay. Oh my God! Oh my God! What happened? What happened? 200 views in an hour. It means that I will get 1k views
in a day for sure. What do you think? I don’t know if you will get the views or not 
but I will get heart attack, my heart just jumped outside. You don’t know anything Ainy. I got so many views in such little time, 
it is a big thing. I feel that I am about to get famous soon. But I don’t know when will the day come 
when my videos will have million views, I am just waiting for that day. You must even get videos, views and 
followers in your dreams as well. No, I am even getting someone else
in my dreams these days. Oh! Who? That.. 
Ramsha? Yes mom? 
Ramsha? Where did you get this from? This? Where did you find this from, mom? I found it from where you kept it. Where did you get it from? Tell me? It is such an expensive phone 
who gave it to you? Tell me? Who gave you this mobile? And you? You would know which friend gave 
this mobile to her? Annie? umm, aunt, actually… Say it, Ainy? Umm that Aff. Afff… Mom, Hania did, Hania gifted this to me. tell her Ainy how rich Hania’s father is? Hania has gifted this to all the friends, mom. Aunt, I kept tea on stove. It will boil, let me go check. What is the need for you take such 
an expensive phone from anyone, return it to her. What is wrong with you mom?
I didn’t ask for it, she gifted it herself and its good to exchange gifts 
between friends. But we should only accept the gifts 
that we can even afford to give them. That’s it, just give it back to her. Mom, what is wrong with you? 
She will feel bad if I return it to her. I can’t return it to her, 
I won’t be able to do it. Okay then I will give it back to your friend,
because I will really like it. No, no, no, no I will give it back myself, what is wrong with you? 
You just get after me, I will give it myself. Thank God I am saved. And this Ainy, I won’t spare her. Afnan. Thank God I am saved. So Ainy, tell me now, what were you about to say 
in front of mom? Umm… nothing. You were about to take Afnan’s name 
in front of mom, right? Sorry Ramsha, I got so scared, I couldn’t understand anything so, and by the way this expensive phone 
was given by Afnan so … So? Listen to me? You know had you taken Afnan’s name 
in front of mom, I would have been in trouble, Ainy. I am sorry. I was so scared I just thought that aunt would give me 
a tight slap right now. Really? When has aunt ever raised her hand 
on you ever before? So, I haven’t even done anything like that 
before this, just because of being with you I think 
that I will get in trouble by aunt someday. Look, Ainy by the way the thing is that when you get in trouble by mom 
is a different thing, but right now the trouble you 
are going to get from me, I won’t spare you. How did you even take Afnan’s name? Now just see. you pulled my braid again. 
You don’t let me study. Okay okay okay sorry. 
Ramsha, I won’t spare you. Dad? Dad? What is going on? Dad, look at her she is beating me 
so much for no reason. She is lying she pulled my braid 
and ran away. What is wrong with you? 
What is this childish behavior? Why do you annoy her? I annoy her? You have no idea how much
she annoys me. she looks very innocent 
but she is a wild cat from inside. Wild cat? Now I will tell you. I won’t spare you now. 
No, no, no. sighs. 
I will tell you the meaning of wild cat. These girls are mad. I am so sorry, I won’t ever call you that but you are a wild cat, no matter 
what you say you will remain a wild cat. How can I just let you go like this? You must watch and walk. So, then you must watch 
and walk carefully too. You would have been hurt 
if you had fallen right now. I have been hurt by the way. What happened to brother? 
He left without even getting angry? I got so scared. I thought he will scold us a lot. Do you know, all these wild cats 
get scared like this. Ramsha! Greetings dad. Greetings. Hey you got back so late today? Dad it’s just that there were 
a lot of meetings today and then there was some work 
so I went to friends. it’s good to meet friends and it’s good to work as well but working so much can affect 
your health and that’s not good. No dad, nothing will happen to my health, now in order to work, I have to do all that, I will have to do all this work. Dad, I will leave now. Afnan? 
Yes? now that you are here, then come let’s 
offer congregational prayer. Umm, dad I would have come but 
I have been awake all night, there was a lot of work so I am really tired 
and sleepy too. You work day and night, you don’t care about day or night and then drain yourself, and you get tired when God called you? Dad, now if I need to take 
my business forward, I will have to work this hard. 
Hmm. You know very well about the business, you know really well, try trading with God too, it wouldn’t just be beneficial 
but will also lead to salvation. Do you know Afnan, when we walk on the path of God, 
he gives us way more reward, and do remember that there is no salvation in the way of success but a lot of success in the way of salvation. You are absolutely right dad, I will try my best to offer prayers next time. May God shows the right path to my son, make him walk the way of salvation 
that you like. Oh God! Show the right path to my son. Prayers are better than sleep, indeed, prayers are better than sleep. Prayers are better than sleep. Is it fine? What do you think? It’s a completely new set. Actually I already have the same phone, I am selling this because I got it as a gift. Will you get such a cheap phone anywhere? Take it and check it properly. Is it stolen? Are you insane or anything?
I look like thief to you? Buy if you want to else don’t. Go away,
I don’t want to give the phone to you. Hey I was just saying,
 you just mind for no reason. Take your money and 
give me the phone. Take it. 
Thank you. Bye. Hi. 
Hi. I have bought it from Ramsha in 40,000. Are you mad? What did I do now? you sold such an expensive phone 
for 40,000? So then what would I do? Don’t you remember what mom said? She was saying that she will break 
this phone if she saw it again. It’s good hat the phone got sold 
and I got some money too and by the way, I really needed money. I am thinking to make a new video 
with this money. What do you think? You are absolutely mad, 
Ramsha, absolutely mad! You just do anything. Are you mad or what? Mind your own business, don’t put a lot of stress on your bird-sized brain,
It will stop working. I atleast have a bird sized brain but 
with you I don’t know whose brain have you got, you don’t think and just do anything. You don’t even care about your honor. Listen, whatever I do is for my honor. So that I am respectable in front of 
everyone and have some dignity. You shouldn’t think at all Annie 
because you just think of rubbish. See how much money did I get. Mr Muslim scholar, just pray that 
my son comes to the right path. May God bless you.
I will definitely pray. If God wills. May God do what’s best. Mr Muslim Scholar., this was our Mr Rafiq, right? Yes, you recognized him right, poor man is so worried. Why? He just has one son, 
he must be your Afnan’s age, he has gotten into bad company 
and if his father tries to talk to him, he fights and argues with his father. I would say that the environment is very bad these days, children are hitting puberty 
before their age. We should marry our children young so that they are prevented from sins. You know if someone gets 
habitual of sinning, it gets very difficult to get rid of it. May God show everyone the right path. Amen. You are absolutely right, you are absolutely right. 
May God do what is the best. Ask Salma how honestly I do my work. I was the one who got Salma’s 
uncle’s sister married too. She is so happy in her home now, 
God has willed it. Yes sister in law, she is right, 
she recommends very nice proposals. Yes, I have my own daughters too, I don’t do matchmaking 
in every other stranger, I just recommend the people 
who are family-oriented. It has been 20 years since 
I am matchmaking, but there have never been any complaints
from any house ever, thank God. Yes, I have an idea, and by the way, I completely trust Salma, she wouldn’t have randomly 
called you here. Mom? Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. Ramsha? I asked you to WhatsApp some of 
your pictures to sister Rukhsana. Umm, if you didn’t have her number,
you could have taken it from me. Do remember to send the pictures. okay. Okay and don’t just send your pictures, also send all your details along with it. Okay. So the talk of your marriage is going on. Stop your nonsense, 
else I will break your face. I am right, see, 
she is asking for your details. Mom, I am going to freshen up. Sure, sure, go. She is very beautiful 
by the grace of God. This matchmaker aunt has made 
my mind so confused that I'm not even able to make tiktoks now. I will have to do something 
about this proposal thing, the game won’t work out like that. Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. Greetings, stay blessed. You guys together today? Yes, mom I called Afnan and asked him
to pick me up and bring me home. That’s good, come have tea with us. No, aunt, I am really tired. She talks so much, 
she eats half of my brain. I will go change, freshen up 
and then have tea. mom, you guys have tea, 
we will have it together. That’s a great idea. 
Yeah? Let’s go. You will make tea. 
okay I will. Let’s go. But you make such a bad tea. 
So I don’t know how to cook food. I am not talking about food, 
I am talking about tea. I can even cook. It’s not my job. Do you actually know 
how to cook food? Yes, why not? 
Brother your tea is getting cold. What happened? 
What are you thinking? I... I was thinking that when both children 
like each other then why not get them married? That’s a great thought. You do one thing, talk to Alizey 
we will then get them married. Married? So sudden? so then what, Afsheen? Alizey has to get married and 
come to this house only. The sooner they get married the better. How can we get them married 
so soon, brother? You know that there are so many wedding 
preparations that need to happen. And it will be the first wedding 
of our house, I have a lot of wishes that 
I will fulfill at this wedding. Actually, brother, I have been thinking 
of talking to you about this for so many days. We can get both of them engaged. The family will find out that 
we have gotten them engaged. Look Afsheen, there is no value 
of engagement, marriage… Marriage will be done too, brother. Let’s do the wedding preparations first. You talk to Afnan and then we will fix the engagement date too. Brother have tea. I will. Did you send them the pictures? No, and I won’t because I don’t want 
to get married. And why don’t you want to get married? Mom, I don’t want to get married, 
means I don’t want to. Don’t ask reasons for everything. Look, my child, there is an age for girls to get married, your father wants to find you a nice match
 soon and get you married. What is wrong with you? Have I become old that I am crossing 
the age of marriage? Its not that my child, the parents of daughters are 
always concerned, they just want to get done with 
their responsibility as soon as possible and they can live peacefully. Mom, please try to understand, when I said that I don’t want to marry 
then I just don’t want to, why are you after me? And as far as dad is concerned, 
I will tell him myself that I don’t want to get married right now. Won’t be ashamed of talking to 
your dad about your marriage? What is there to be ashamed of, I will just tell him that I don’t want to get 
married, there is nothing wrong with it. it’s the right and true thing to say. You won’t talk to your dad about 
anything like that. Best! Then you should be convinced 
and convince dad too and yes, mom,  I am not saying 
that I don’t want to marry at all, just for a few days, 
I mean for a few years, throw this topic out of the house. And as far as marriage is concerned, I will let you guys know when 
I would want to get married. What? What did you say? You will talk to your dad about 
your marriage yourself and will tell him when do you want 
to get married. Won’t you feel any shame? What is there to feel shame about? It is my marriage so obviously I will tell. Ramsha, look there is an age for girls to get married, and if that age crosses, then it gets difficult to get good proposals. And if girls get married at the right age,
the parents get peace too. my beloved mom, your brain has become like old mentality, there are a lot of proposals and age is left too, I will look for a good proposal myself. Don’t worry. Oh God. Where is Shani? My breakfast is over and 
he hasn’t come yet. He is coming. greetings. Greetings. 
Mehnaz, get tea. Yes. yes. bringing. 
Listen, you must go to the shop early today because your uncle and I have to go 
for an important work, understand? Okay. Sister in law, did you give 
Ramsha’s pictures to aunt? Yes, I WhatsApped a few pictures of her. Tell aunt the boy should be 
from a good family and e should have a good job too. In fact, it would be better 
if he owns a business. Okay, I will tell her. Dad, actually I wanted to talk to you 
about something important. Say it. Actually I… Hey? What is it? She just says 
anything at anytime. Now look she  is saying she won’t go
 to the university, she will take leaves. Someone please tell her that 
why will she take leaves from university? Your mom is right? Why will you take an off? Yes, that’s right. 
Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. Annie, I am going to the university, 
come after me if you want to. Brother, shall we leave too? 
We are getting late. Hmm. I will make you have piping hot tea there. Hmm. Yeah. Okay, bye. 
Bye. Okay. Hmmm. Bye. Bye. Mom, Ramsha is getting married? We are just looking for a match for now, 
just pray that we get a good match for her. But why are you asking? Just like that. Okay, take this. 
I will take it.
