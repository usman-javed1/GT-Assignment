[21.28] Your uncle was talking about your
and Afnan’s wedding.
[28.24] So, I told him that
[30.12] we should get you two engaged.
[32.52] Now you tell me what date to finalize?
[35.64] Did you talk to Afnan?
[37.96] Ask him as well.
[42.16] Afnan is just not my nephew,
 in fact he is like my son.
[47.68] I know well what he likes and dislikes.
[55.36] Greetings.
[56.48] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[58.36] Okay mama, I will go now.
[59.68] Hey, where are you going? 
I will drop you.
[61.72] No, no, there is no need for that.
[63.72] Now you will not drop me 
to the office daily.
[65.96] Yes, so I can drop you daily as well.
[75.28] I like spending time with you anyway.
[79.56] Now whether it is for a few moments
 or for my whole life.
[84.48] Afnan is right.
[86.08] After all, he has to take up 
your responsibility later on,
[88.68] then why not now?
[91.20] Aunt. See,
[93.72] this is how two smart people are,
[95.48] and there are certain who don’t understand
 anything.
[98.32] Okay, shall we go, 
Mr. Smarty pants?
[100.24] Come on. Come.
[101.84] Aunt, I will come. 
Goodbye.
[103.84] Goodbye. 
Okay, goodbye.
[118.16] This is why I was telling you 
we should take a rickshaw.
[120.80] Damn miser.
[122.48] The bus will be here soon.
[123.92] It is so hot, my skin gets ruined like this.
[136.20] You two?
[137.56] Brother, you?
[138.48] Yes, I was going for some work.
[141.04] Come on, I will drop you home.
[143.56] Thank God you came, 
it is really hot anyway.
[145.44] Come on, Ramsha. 
One minute. Wait.
[148.12] Whose car is this?
[151.44] A friend’s car.
[152.68] God will give my brother an even
better can than this.
[156.00] Hah, day dreaming.
[158.60] Did you say something?
Huh? No.
[160.64] Come on. Come on. Quickly. 
I feel really hot.
[162.20] I will sit in the front.
[163.36] The AC works better in the front.
Come on, quickly.
[179.84] What happened?
[181.12] Did the car breakdown brother?
[182.56] The ice cream here is really good.
[184.96] I thought I would get it for you people.
Do you people want to have it?
[187.44] What is the matter?
[188.96] You are being really good with us, today.
[191.20] Yes, think that I felt like it.
[193.00] Anyway, I feel I should have mercy
on you people once in a while.
[197.76] Really? Then do one thing,
[199.80] sit here, comfortably, have mercy, 
we will go have ice cream.
[201.84] Hey, wait. Wait. Wait. 
Where are you people going?
[204.08] I will get the ice cream, you people will sit
in the car and eat it.
[206.36] No, there is no fun sitting here 
and eating ice cream?
[208.84] We will eat it at the restaurant. 
Sit, calmly.
[213.68] Your brother is really weird, you know.
[215.24] It will be fun.
[216.24] We should just get ice cream. 
Whether in the car or at the restaurant.
[220.04] You are a really boring girl.
[253.16] Here you go.
[254.52] I had asked for the mango flavor.
[256.20] Hey, this is their famous flavor, try it.
[259.40] You got it by yourself.
[265.44] Shall we go? Does anyone want 
anything else?
[267.68] It is tasty.
[281.12] I couldn’t find my charger, 
so I thought I would use yours.
[284.68] Hey, so everything I own is yours.
[289.88] All okay?
[291.60] You are in a really romantic mood 
nowadays?
[293.68] Really? Do you feel this way?
[297.44] That’s how it is.
[299.36] What is bad in that?
[301.04] It is a good thing.
[305.84] One minute.
[308.96] This is surely bad.
[312.20] In what?
[313.20] That you cut the call without seeing.
[316.28] What do you think? 
I will doubt you?
[319.28] No, but you know there is a question,
[322.36] will you really ever doubt me?
[326.92] Should I tell you the truth?
[331.28] One minute.
[336.56] What is it, Afnan?
[338.32] Why are you cutting my call 
again and again?
[340.44] I am restless to talk to you.
[346.72] I will try again.
[353.44] Why are you not attending the call?
[354.76] Hey it is not that necessary 
to attend the call.
[356.84] Leave it. Tell me,
[358.64] will you ever doubt my love?
[363.64] Hmmm,
[364.72] you do one thing, you talk. 
We will talk later.
[367.72] Hey, no, it is not an important call.
[370.72] Pick the call.
[413.40] Mama.
[415.48] What are you cooking?
[416.88] Hey son, I am cooking 
the potato meat you like,
[419.24] but now don’t eat anything 
from outside and come home.
[429.44] What is the matter?
[431.48] No. No.
[433.48] Do you want to talk about something?
[441.60] Yes, mama, this…
[448.16] I don’t understand how do I talk to you.
[453.20] I…
[454.20] I have been meaning to say something 
to you for a few days now.
[457.84] Child, what is it that you have to 
think so much?
[467.92] They are talking about looking for 
a proposal for Ramsha, right?
[470.04] Yes, they are looking for a proposal.
[473.00] Sister-in-law and brother Sajid want 
that it is someone we know.
[477.88] So do you have a friend, then tell me.
[482.72] No.
[484.24] No?
[485.68] Then?
[488.80] I was thinking
[490.80] if you talk about me for Ramsha, 
with elder mama, then….
[497.04] What are you saying, Shani?
[500.60] Mama, what is so surprising in this?
[503.04] No, all my life I felt that
[506.40] you and Ramsha don’t get along,
[509.68] you always scold her.
[511.64] You two don’t get along at all.
[513.96] Hey, mama, leave it.
[516.00] I am telling you,
[517.72] you try and talk to elder mama and papa.
[522.04] No, son, Shani, think well once,
[526.64] because this is a decision for life
[529.04] and I want that your and Ramsha’s 
temperament don’t match at all. So…
[534.76] Mama, whatever I am saying, 
I am saying it after thinking.
[541.20] You talk to them.
[548.60] I will be back for dinner.
[587.20] Yes, ask Mr. Shafiq to email me that file.
[590.72] I am waiting.
[603.36] He cut the call again.
[605.36] What is the problem, Afnan?
[606.96] This man never picks up my call.
[634.44] Hello.
[636.24] Hello.
[637.72] Greetings Afnan.
[639.56] Greetings.
[640.96] I have been calling you for so long.
[642.84] I called so many times, 
why don’t you answer my call?
[645.60] I was just a little busy. 
You tell me, is all okay?
[649.68] I am fine.
[650.96] I feel you don’t have time for me at all.
[654.56] No, nothing like that.
I am just a little busy.
[658.04] There is a lot of work in the office.
[659.88] Yes, so? If you cannot talk to me
 in the office, so what?
[663.88] You talk to me when you get home.
[665.88] Call me when you are at home.
[668.20] When I am at home, I want to spend 
most of my time with my family.
[673.08] I like spending time with my family.
[677.44] Hmmm...
[678.36] that’s great.
[681.08] You think well.
[682.56] Or else when do boys of today want 
to spend time at home.
[686.12] They just go around with friends, 
at times here, at times there.
[691.40] You know my cousin, Shani,
[693.48] he goes around with his friends 
all day long.
[696.32] We don’t see him at home.
[698.20] We don’t know when he comes and 
when leaves, we don’t find out.
[700.52] And you know that’s the thing 
with all boys…Hello?
[703.12] Yes?
Are you listening?
[705.20] At times I feel I keep on talking and
you cut the call and leave.
[708.76] No, no, I am listening, you talk.
[713.00] Okay Afnan,
[714.28] I wanted to talk to you about 
something important.
[716.40] Yes, go ahead.
[718.24] May I come in, sir?
[720.16] Yes, come.
[721.20] Afnan, I…that I….
[725.00] Listen, I will call you back. Bye.
[728.36] No, no, I want to talk. Hello, Afnan?
 I wanted to talk to you.
[733.12] What is the problem? 
He doesn’t listen to me completely.
[735.32] He always cuts the call.
[737.72] Sir, I want to talk to you about 
something important.
[739.92] Have a seat.
[753.80] Afnan, I want to talk to you 
about something important.
[755.76] You don’t have time to talk on the phone.
[758.32] You please meet me, please.
[767.60] Okay. Okay. Fine.
[769.80] One minute, sir.
[772.32] Afnan, I want to talk to you 
about something important.
[774.44] You don’t have time to talk on the phone.
[776.92] You please meet me, please.
[784.16] Sorry. Yes, go ahead. 
Yes…
[797.16] Yes!
[821.48] By the way, isn’t this lip colour really light?
[824.96] I will put on a dark one.
[827.76] You know, the dark one will look good.
[850.48] Come on.
[852.84] Isn’t it a bit much.
[856.48] What have I done to my hair today?
[859.24] My hair doesn’t look good at all.
[861.64] What has happened to me? 
I usually look really good,
[864.08] but why is everything looking 
so bad today?
[868.32] I don’t know if Afnan will like me or not?
[873.32] Anyway, we will see.
[893.88] There are those girls 
who don’t take a scarf or veil,
[898.24] and then there are girls like us
[899.76] who wear an entire tent going anywhere.
[903.32] I have to do all this because of mama 
and papa.
[906.64] I don’t know how Afnan will find me 
in this getup.
[910.24] Okay.
[920.16] I am not putting a scarf on my head.
[937.16] Hello. 
Hello.
[939.28] How are you? 
What are you doing?
[941.00] Nothing, I am working.
[943.28] Why? What happened?
[944.84] Alizeh, I have a really busy day today.
[948.88] I have a lot of meetings lined up.
[951.00] I won’t be able to come pick you up.
[953.88] Is it possible that you go yourself?
[956.44] Oh, okay,
[958.60] I was thinking we would go for 
dinner today.
[961.64] Hey, you should have told me earlier,
[963.96] I would have canceled my meeting.
[966.92] Okay no problem, we will go later.
[969.92] You finish your work. 
Are you sure?
[972.56] Yes. Don’t worry.
[974.84] Shall we plan for tomorrow?
[976.92] Fine. Thank you.
[978.72] Okay. I will see you. Bye. Bye.
[994.12] Ramsha…
Yes?
[996.00] I wanted to ask you something.
[999.16] Yes?
[1001.52] You are coming from a wedding, 
right now, right?
[1005.12] No.
[1006.96] You are not coming from a wedding?
[1009.16] Then you must surely be coming 
from a birthday.
[1012.40] Not at all.
[1013.68] I get it. I get it.
[1015.52] You have to go to a musical evening 
or mendhi function on your way back, right?
[1019.80] Hey, no Afnan, what is wrong?
[1022.04] Why are you asking me this 
again and again?
[1023.40] Why don’t I ask you?
[1025.16] Look at your dress. You are wearing 
such a heavy dress,
[1028.32] the makeup is so loud, so I need to ask.
[1033.76] I dressed up for you and came.
[1036.96] Really?
[1040.52] But I never asked you to dress up 
so much.
[1043.28] Hey, I thought I would dress up for you
and you would like it.
[1047.00] You don’t look good at all.
[1049.44] You know, your beauty is in your simplicity,
[1053.64] in your innocence.
[1055.44] Stay this way.
[1056.68] Don’t wear such a heavy dress, 
don’t wear so much makeup.
[1060.00] Okay fine, I will be careful in future.
[1063.40] Okay tell me,
[1065.04] what was the important thing 
you called me for.
[1069.16] You don’t talk to properly on the phone.
[1071.24] You don’t have time for me at all.
[1073.32] So, I thought I would sit in front of you
 and talk.
[1076.52] Yes, so tell me, what is the matter? 
Tell me something.
[1079.84] Afnan, I am really worried.
[1081.72] So worried that I have lost my sleep
[1085.16] and there is no peace in my life.
[1089.40] Wont you ask what happened?
[1091.44] Hey you are talking so much,
[1093.40] I have been asking you for so long, 
what happened? Tell me.
[1096.28] My parents want to marry me.
[1100.92] Your marriage?
Yes.
[1105.28] But why? Why are they in such a hurry?
[1107.52] Make them understand, tell them that
[1110.52] you want to resume your education,
[1112.88] so you cannot get married right now.
[1115.32] I am tired of making them understand.
[1117.24] Those people are not ready to listen to me.
[1120.28] Okay relax.
[1122.28] Don’t get so stressed so quickly.
[1124.44] Hey, you tell them that
[1128.28] you want to be the girl from today’s times.
[1131.00] A girl who is strong, independent,
 well educated,
[1135.08] someone who can stand on her own feet.
[1137.48] I am sure they will agree.
[1162.32] This is Afnan’s car.
[1165.44] But what is it doing outside 
this restaurant?
[1178.48] If you say these things, 
they will be convinced.
[1181.08] You know, I have several such examples….
[1186.28] Ramsha.
[1189.40] Hello.
[1192.44] Hello. Yes, Afnan, where are you?
[1194.96] I…
[1196.72] I have come for an official meeting.
[1203.24] You are in the office.
[1204.68] No. Yes.
[1206.36] Why? What happened? 
Why are you asking?
[1209.24] No, nothing. 
I thought I would just ask again
[1212.36] if you are free.
[1216.16] Okay.
[1220.48] Ramsha, we will have to leave.
[1223.56] I have a very important meeting, 
I have to go.
[1225.36] No. No. No, Afnan. Not right now. 
Right now, sit comfortably.
[1229.16] I have to talk to you about a lot of things.
[1230.88] Hey, I am telling you, I will talk to you later.
 Please, let me go.
[1234.16] Afnan, we have still not eaten anything.
[1235.60] I will feed you something on the way.
Come on,
[1237.40] we will have to leave from here right now. 
You are always in a hurry.
[1239.88] No problem.
[1319.64] Sister-in-law.
[1321.88] Where is Ramsha?
[1323.76] Hey, Salma, she went to her friend’s place.
[1329.36] Sister-in-law, don’t mind but
[1332.48] Ramsha going to her friends daily 
like this is not good.
[1336.40] At times someone has a birthday, 
someone has a party.
[1340.04] There is also my daughter Annie.
[1342.16] I don’t let her go alone like this.
[1346.56] Salma, you know Ramsha.
[1349.24] Wherever she goes, 
she makes friends.
[1352.48] Now see, she is a child, 
what all do I tell her not to do?
[1356.56] You are right. 
You get to know people.
[1359.28] But girls going to the home of others 
doesn’t look nice.
[1365.12] Salma, the daughters are 
in their parents’ home,
[1367.84] they can go around wherever they want.
[1371.08] Now see, she will be married in future.
[1373.80] God knows what sort of in-laws she will get.
[1375.32] Whether they let her come and go,
 anywhere.
[1377.72] So, thinking this, your brother 
and I don’t say no to her.
[1382.52] Sit. Sit.
[1383.92] Just pray that she gets married 
in a good home.
[1387.92] Hey sister-in-law, you stop worrying 
about Ramsha’s proposal.
[1394.28] You just think that Ramsha will live with her 
in-laws the same way she lives in her home.
[1401.56] What do you mean?
[1403.00] Meaning,
[1405.72] Anwar and I already wanted 
to talk to you.
[1409.00] So now that sister-in-law has 
touched on the topic,
[1411.68] I thought I would also talk to you.
[1416.44] Anwar and I were thinking that we put 
for Shani’s proposal for Ramsha…
[1430.28] Look brother,
[1432.80] Ramsha is our only daughter,
[1435.20] she is the daughter of the home, 
she will stay at home.
[1438.76] She will stay in front of the eyes of 
both of you, you people will be happy.
[1443.04] As far as Shani is concerned,
[1445.44] so he has been brought up in your hands,
you know him well.
[1455.24] Brother, whatever decision you make,
[1458.72] we will accept it.
[1460.76] Anwar, give me some time,
[1463.40] then we will talk about this. 
Yes, brother. Sure. Yes.
[1467.32] Make tea. 
Yes.
[1528.24] Papa, what happened? 
How long will it take?
[1530.48] I don’t know child, the car is not starting.
[1532.80] That is why I always tell you 
to buy a new car,
[1535.00] but when do you listen to me?
[1536.76] Hey, what do we have to do 
getting a new car?
[1538.40] It is a fine car, it was running fine,
it broke down now.
[1543.60] What happened elder papa?
[1545.36] Man, I don’t know 
what happened to the car.
[1548.20] It was working fine, 
it is not working.
[1550.44] I was going to drop her 
to her friend’s home.
[1552.08] I have to drop her at the 
degree college area.
[1555.12] Yes, so I am also going there, 
I will drop her.
[1559.80] Okay fine,
[1561.40] you go with Shani.
[1563.04] I will go get a mechanic.
[1566.84] On the bike?
[1568.44] I go on the bike, what else do I go on?
[1573.00] Do you know how to drive it 
or will you make me fall?
[1576.80] Why? What happened? 
Don’t you trust me?
[1579.48] Should I tell you the truth?
[1580.68] I don’t trust you even this much.
[1583.20] But okay, I will trust you today.
[1587.84] Ramsha,
[1589.12] it is my promise to you that 
I will never let you fall.
[1591.64] Come on, now.
[1593.36] Awww…thank you so much,
[1595.60] you have done me a favour.
 Shall we go now?
[1597.68] Yes, yes, come on.
 Come. Come.
[1620.96] Say three, two, one,
 I will be ready.
[1622.84] Yes, yes, okay. I am doing it. 
Come on
[1625.12] Three. Two. One.
[1630.64] Annie, who is there?
[1632.56] I am over here.
Look here and shoot.
[1634.40] You know nothing. Look at this. 
I will stand here.
[1637.40] Pan the camera up from my feet 
to my face
[1640.04] and I will bounce my hair like this, 
then bring it on my face.
[1641.96] Okay. Okay. 
Got it?
[1642.84] Yes. 
Ready?
[1644.36] Ready. 
Come on. Come on. Come on.
[1646.24] Three. Two. One.
[1653.76] Hello. I am here.
[1655.72] Here is my face.
[1656.84] You had asked me to move 
from the face from the feet.
[1659.04] What is wrong? 
You don’t have to get stuck.
[1662.64] Do it properly. Come on.
[1664.80] Three. Two. One.
[1666.72] Ready.
[1669.40] What happened now, Annie?
[1671.52] Do you know what is going on 
in the home?
[1673.04] Do you care about anyone or not?
[1678.36] I know well what is going on 
in this home.
[1680.72] That is why I went to meet that Afnan.
[1682.60] What?
[1684.68] You went to meet Afnan again?
[1687.68] You are saying it like 
I go to meet him daily.
[1694.88] You know, if it was up to me,
[1697.56] I would go to meet him daily.
[1702.60] You know, talking to him,
[1705.52] seeing him, listening to him talk…
[1709.08] I like him so much and he too likes me a lot.
[1712.16] Are you mad?
[1715.56] What is there to go mad in this?
[1717.96] After all, I told him about my proposal.
[1721.24] Another proposal has come for you, 
about which you have no idea.
[1725.68] I am tired of making mama understand.
[1729.04] Once I get my hands on the aunt 
that brings proposals,
[1731.32] after that I will make her forget 
the way to this home.
[1734.88] The aunt that brings proposals didn’t bring it.
[1737.80] Whatever, buddy.
[1738.76] What difference does it make to me?
I will not get married.
[1742.88] Ramsha, you don’t understand me.
[1745.68] You tell me, what did Afnan say hearing 
about your proposal?
[1748.28] He was saying, tell your parents 
you don’t want to get married right now,
[1751.40] you are young, you need to study.
[1754.00] Is that all he said?
[1755.52] Yes, so what else did he have to say?
[1757.44] I mean, did he not say that
[1759.88] he would send his family 
with a proposal for you?
[1762.56] Have you gone mad?
[1764.36] How is this possible? I have still not 
met anyone from his family,
[1768.32] then where did the proposal come from?
[1769.96] So, did he say that he will introduce you 
to his family?
[1773.60] No,
[1775.64] he said nothing like that.
[1777.16] He didn’t say that, then 
he is not serious with you.
[1780.68] Have you gone mad? 
How is he not serious?
[1784.08] If he was not serious, he wouldn’t have 
come with me asking him once,
[1787.76] and he would have told me to get 
married as per my family’s liking.
[1791.68] But he didn’t say anything like that.
[1794.76] In fact, he has said that
[1796.64] tell your family that you don’t want 
to get married right now,
[1799.80] you have to study.
[1801.56] And I am thinking this is a good excuse
to coax mama and papa.
[1807.20] This way, I will get a few days
[1810.28] and I will also be able to 
meet Afnan’s family easily.
[1814.08] Come to your senses Ramsha, 
you know mama…
[1816.80] Annie. Annie.
[1821.00] What is it?
[1822.44] What are you two talking about 
secretly over here at this time?
[1825.72] We were just talking, mama.
[1827.24] Talk about what? 
You talk all day long.
[1830.08] You are talking at this time too?
[1831.68] Do you not run out of things to talk about?
[1834.20] Don’t you have to sleep? Come on.
[1836.20] Yes, mama.
[1837.80] Bye. Bye, Ramsha.
[1841.52] Come on.
[1885.92] Hey aunt.
[1887.60] Why are you standing like this, Afnan?
[1890.68] I was waiting for Alizeh.
[1895.08] By the way, why has she not come till now?
[1896.60] It is really late. She comes back 
from the office by this time.
[1900.16] But she came home a long time back.
[1903.56] Really?
[1905.08] Why did I not find out? 
Where is she?
[1907.40] So, did she not meet you? 
No.
[1909.96] She is in her room.
[1911.64] Since she has come from the office,
she has locked herself in the room.
[1914.68] I had thought that the office work 
must be a lot.
[1918.20] I tried asking her but 
she didn’t answer me correctly.
[1921.32] You ask her.
[1922.96] Okay fine.
[1923.96] You don’t worry, I will see.
[2006.76] I am surprised, madam,
[2008.20] I am looking for you all around the house 
and you are standing in a corner of your room.
[2012.12] What happened?
[2015.68] Hey,
[2017.68] I am asking you something. 
What happened?
[2019.64] I am listening.
[2021.76] Hey, you are listening? 
You are in a bad mood?
[2025.76] Nothing happened.
[2027.44] Hey, how has nothing happened?
[2029.40] Aunt was telling me that since 
you have come from the office,
[2031.52] you are locked in your room.
[2032.96] Something must have happened.
[2035.56] I am asking you something.
[2037.92] I am surprised. You are asking me?
[2042.12] If I don’t ask you, 
then who would I ask?
[2044.16] Hey, I don’t know about this.
[2046.20] Okay, I will guess.
[2047.56] Aunt said something? 
Did she scold you?
[2049.84] No? if aunt didn’t scold you, 
then papa?
[2052.48] But papa cannot say anything, 
he loves you a lot.
[2055.76] So, who is left, then? 
Meaning, me.
[2059.48] But madam, how can I even dare 
say anything in front of madam.
[2063.96] Hmmm.
[2065.52] You cannot say anything in front of me,
[2068.32] but you can do everything.
[2076.68] What do you mean? I…I…
Oh please, Afnan.
[2079.48] Stop testing my patience.
[2082.60] You have lied enough.
[2085.00] How much more will you lie?
[2086.48] When you were not in the office, then 
why did you tell me that you are in the office?
[2091.52] No Alizeh, I was in the office…
Shut up.
[2094.96] I saw you with that girl 
with my own eyes.
[2097.96] Who was that girl, Afnan?
[2101.28] Who was that girl?
Alizeh, listen…
[2103.84] How can you do this with me?
Alizeh. Alizeh, listen…
[2108.40] What do you want to say?
 Speak up.
[2110.08] Okay, if you let me speak, 
then I will respond.
[2113.80] Alizeh, you think wrong, 
there is nothing like you are thinking.
[2116.76] I don’t want to talk to you. 
Move from here.
[2118.84] Alizeh, please, I am telling you 
to trust me. What…
[2120.84] I trusted you the most, 
and what did you do?
[2124.20] You broke my trust.
[2126.80] I am so disappointed with you, Afnan.
[2154.56] Afnan, what is the matter?
[2156.76] Why did Alizeh leave so angrily?
[2159.84] I don’t know aunt.
[2160.92] I don’t know what happened to her.
[2165.40] Excuse me.
[2179.20] My Tik Toks turned out to be great.
[2184.56] Papa, mama, both of you are here?
[2187.84] If you wanted something, 
then you should have called me.
[2189.64] Why? Can we not come 
to our daughter’s room?
[2192.40] I thought today we will go and 
talk to our daughter a lot.
[2196.20] We don’t usually get time.
[2197.60] It is good you came yourself.
[2199.36] Because you are busy on the shop 
all day long,
[2201.16] you don’t have time for me.
[2202.88] Did you come home early today?
[2205.28] Mehnaz, this is the same Ramsha, right?
[2209.32] She grew up so quickly.
[2212.44] I remember the day when a nurse had 
brought a doll and gave her in my arms
[2216.80] and said that sir, 
you have had a daughter.
[2219.24] And I had thanked God.
[2221.44] That God, thank you for sending 
a blessing to our home.
[2225.68] Hey, you ask me,
[2227.48] who has tolerated her every single day.
[2229.72] Your daughter has grown up with difficulty.
Do you see?
[2232.68] Do you hear that? She tolerates me daily.
[2235.20] It is good you heard it yourself today.
[2236.80] No, no, child, your mother loves you a lot, 
she said it as a joke.
[2240.68] I know that. Mama loves me the most.
[2251.24] Yes, yes,
[2253.28] Ramsha, the thing is that a 
proposal has come for you.
[2259.96] I am tired of this aunt that 
bring proposals, papa.
[2263.76] This proposal wasn’t brought by the aunt 
who gets proposals done,
[2267.12] in fact, your aunt sent it.
[2271.68] Aunt?
[2273.68] Hey mama, you go and tell aunt, 
that if she wants to get someone married,
[2276.36] then get Annie married. 
Why is everyone after me?
[2279.00] Oh, come on, Ramsha. 
What nonsense is this?
[2282.00] At least first ask us whose proposal 
she has brought.
[2286.24] Yes, actually, your aunt has asked for 
your hand for Shani.
[2293.56] What?
[2296.32] Shani and I?
