Have you gone mad? 
Have you lost your mind, Shani? I didn’t ask them for money staying 
in that home, and I will ask for it now? Don’t even think about it. Hey, it was different earlier. 
Now you are married, the responsibilities increase after marriage,
the expenses increase. I am your responsibility,
 Shani, not his. Why will he give us money? You know, this is the limit. 
The limit. I took you to the restaurant, 
I fed you food, I took you for an outing and 
you cannot do this much for me? Shani, I thought you did all this 
for my happiness. You did all this to ask me 
for a favour? Okay listen, I don’t want to
 get into this. It is simple. You will go to their home tomorrow 
and bring money, okay? You have gone completely mad. Neither will I got him, nor will I ask them for money. So, you can do what you want. Don’t… Ramsha, you are making me get angry, and you know when I get angry, 
I become really dangerous. Shani, it hurts, and you can do 
what you want. I won’t be scared of your threats. 
Are you mad? Inside!
Shani, what are you doing? Go inside. What are you doing, Shani? 
Don’t be mad. Open the door. 
Aunt. Aunt. Open the door. Aunt. What is this noise? 
What happened? Mama, that’s Ramsha’s voice, 
it is coming from brother’s room. Come on, let’s see. 
Shani, open the door. 
What is this nonsense, Shani? Hey, Shani, what are you doing? No one will open the door for her,
till I come back. No, Shani give me the keys. Don’t do this. 
Why are you doing this? Mama, I will show her 
what stubbornness is. She shows me stubbornness. No, Shani. 
Move back. Shani. Shani, 
what are you doing? She is locked somewhere in the store. Child, he took the keys with him. I will do something. 
You call your father. Call him and ask him to come quickly. 
Yes. Child, we are coming. 
We are coming. Shani. Aunt. Aunt, please open the door.
I feel suffocated here aunt. Aunt, it is really hot here. Aunt. Shani. Shani, please open the door. Shani, I feel suffocated here, please open the door. Please open the door. God. Did you talk to your father? No mama, his phone is off. Oh God, what do I do now? It is so hot, and I don’t know why 
we had a power failure. God knows what the child must be 
going through in there. Call Shani. Call Shani’s number 
and make me talk to him. Okay. Even brother in not answering. Oh God, what do I do now? Tell me, we are sweating badly 
in this heat, then what will be the condition of 
the child that is locked in that room. What do I do? I don’t understand. 
This is my mistake. This is my mistake. I should have 
slapped Shani twice and taken the keys of the room. How was I to know he would go out of 
the home for so long. You are right. Even I couldn’t imagine brother would 
do something like this with Ramsha. Okay, you call your father and 
bring me my scarf till then. Where are you going? I will go check on Shani, he must be 
sitting at a nearby tea stall. Look, if we sit here and wait for him, then he will not come home till night. God forbid, if something happens to 
poor Ramsha in this suffocation and heat, then what will be say to our late sister-in-law,
our late brother. What will we say to them 
on the day of judgement? That we let him do this to their 
poor daughter? Go bring my scarf. I will bring it. Who is here at this time? 
I am coming. I am coming. Hey, I am coming. Who is it?
 Greetings. Greetings. Were you going somewhere? No. Yes, actually, I was going 
to get vegetables. Did you come alone? No, no, Afnan is also there, 
he is parking the car. Actually, he couldn’t find parking here. Okay, he will come after parking. 
You come on, come. What was the need to bring all this? Yes, you are absolutely right. We didn’t need it, I thought these things would 
come in use of you. What is wrong, aunt? 
Why are you saying these things? I feel really hot, 
when will the power be restored. We have had a power failure 
for long. Don’t you have a generator? I am asking you something. Did you say something to me? Don’t you have a generator? No, it has broken down. You please call Ramsha, we didn’t come here for that long. 
We will just meet her and leave. Hey, wow, wow, this is really good. Today, you people have come
at a good time. Did you come to meet Ramsha? Obviously, or else why would we 
come here? Go, open the door. What? I open the door. Yes, 
I will just open the door for her. Right now, let me meet my in-laws. You please call Ramsha, 
after that we will leave. Ramsha is locked in the room upstairs. What are you saying? Yes, she had started to speak a lot nowadays. So, I thought I would find a solution. That is why I locked her in the room 
upstairs, what else? But now that you people are here, 
I will go get her. Okay? I will come. Okay? I will bring her. Offer them some tea. I will just come. Tea… Surprise. No one is here. Let me call Afnan. Tabassum. Yes, madam? I don’t see anyone, where is everyone? Elder sir took his medication 
and went to sleep. Madam Afsheen and sir Afnan 
went to madam Ramsha’s home. Fine, you can go. Come on, drink water. 
Drink some. Come on. Drink some water. That’s it, I am fine. Are you in your senses, Shani? Does anyone treat their wife like this? Whose wife is she? Mine, right? So, I don’t understand why are you
 being so sympathetic towards her. She is my wife, I will do what I want. If she is your wife, then consider her
 your wife. Don’t treat her like an animal. If she doesn’t listen to you, then 
make her understand with love. Locking her in the room is not right. God forbid, had something happened 
to her, then? Yes, so what? At max, she would have died. Everyone has to die. But what I don’t understand is this, that why are you sympathizing 
with her so much? Afnan, be quiet. It is a matter between husband and wife, 
why do you need to interfere? Yes, see. If someone is smart in your home, then that is her. This man is not worthy enough
that you stay with him. You come with us, now you will not
stay here even for a minute. Afnan, this is my home. Shani is my husband. 
I will not go anywhere. And this is our personal matter, it would be better that you don’t speak
in our personal matter. Fine. Afnan. Hey. 
hey. Hey, at least have tea before leaving. Afnan, whatever has happened today, try that brother doesn’t find out. You know brother’s blood pressure 
is so high and after all, he is really sensitive 
in Ramsha’s matter. I don’t believe it. Shani can do something 
so cheap with Ramsha. Now leave it. There is no point in worrying about this. You see yourself, Ramsha said it in front of
you that this is her personal matter, so it is better that we don’t interfere. Yes, you are absolutely right. Actually, you are right, we have no right to interfere in 
someone’s private and personal life. We should never do it. No matter how much pain and suffering 
the other person is going through. But won’t this be selfishness? Have you not seen the condition 
in which Ramsha is living. The pain she is in. and you want that I don’t support her 
in this condition, I stay away from this matter. So, what do I do, Afnan? You tell me. The decision to marry Shani 
was Ramsha’s own. Absolutely wrong. You and I both know well the amount 
of pressure Ramsha was in. The situation around her became such and Alizeh has a fault in all this. If Alizeh had acted smartly then, then Ramsha wouldn’t have had to
take this step. Anyway, there is no point 
in talking about his. Because we are crying over spilt milk. You are absolutely right. Actually, I should listen to you. There is no point, because helping 
someone in their pain is something which people with hearts can do, and we don’t have a heart. Okay, tell me something, Afnan. This argument you are doing with me, will this change Ramsha’s life? Or Shani’s behaviour will improve? Then only does this argument 
make sense, and if not, then there is no point in this argument. Look Afnan, these things happen in small areas 
on a daily basis, and you know the maid I have called, her husband beats her daily. Now these things are unbelievable for us, but it is daily routine for them. Okay Afnan, okay relax. You don’t worry, I will talk to Ramsha’s aunt to make 
Shani understand. Okay, fine. Greetings. 
Greetings. Dad, I am so sorry. 
I know you are not well, but these are some important papers, 
I needed your signatures on them. No, I am fine. 
Nothing has happened. I have it. I have it. I spoke to Mr. Mehtab, he will send his son tomorrow. 
Okay. You meet him, and tell Mr. Mehtab that he should get
the contract tomorrow and if possible, sign it too. Absolutely right, dad. 
Here you go. Hey Afsheen, you didn’t tell me, 
you went to Ramsha’s home. How is she? How was she? 
Is she fine? Dad, that…
Yes, yes, brother, she is absolutely fine. I took everything you asked me to. You did good. In fact, her aunt was even saying 
what is the need to bring so many things. I feel his aunt is a very sophisticated 
and gracious lady. Yes, Ramsha was telling me 
her aunt really cares for her. Afsheen, I was saying that you visit once or twice in a month 
or two to Ramsha’s home. Yes, sure. So that she realizes that 
she is part of our family, we have not forgotten her, okay? Ramsha, I am thinking 
I will change my bike. It is bothering me a lot. But won’t a new bike be really expensive,
Shani? It is expensive, but it is expensive for us, but if Mr. Qasim gets it, then… Are you in your senses?
Why would I take money from him? I never took money while staying 
at his house then why would I ask now? Don’t even think about it. You know, this is the limit. 
The limit. I took you to the restaurant, 
I fed you food, I took you for an outing and 
you cannot do this much for me? I thought you did all this 
for my happiness. You did all this to ask me for a favour? Okay listen, 
I don’t want to get into this. It is simple. You will go to their home tomorrow 
and bring money, okay? You have gone completely mad. Neither will I got him,
nor will I ask them for money. So, you can do what you want. 
Don’t… Ramsha, you are making me get angry, 
and you know when I get angry, 
I become really dangerous. Shani, it hurts, 
and you can do what you want. I won’t be scared of your threats. 
Are you mad? Inside!
Shani, what are you doing? Go inside. What are you doing, Shani? Just once. You just say to me once that 
you don’t want to get married, I will support you. 
I will stand by you… What is wrong with you Afnan? What are you saying? Why are you torturing and hurting me. It is really late anyway, if it gets further late then I will get 
humiliated again because of you. I will not let anything like this happen. I promise you. You speak the truth once. Be strong and tell me. 
I will stand by you, Shani won’t be able to say 
anything to you… What is wrong with you? Why are you saying these things? 
Why are you hurting me? Why are you torturing me with 
what you are saying? Because I want to marry you. Hello. Hello. Can you come to my office? 
I want to meet you. Yes, I am coming. Yes, brother Shani. I am going to do something important. Okay. If papa asks then tell him. Yes, I will tell him. and this is Mr. Mustafa’s grocery, 
when he comes give it to him. Okay, I will give it. Mr. Afnan, see, now you know the inflation, the shop is not working that well. This is something to worry about. Look, I don’t have time to listen
 to your stories. It would be better that you 
come straight to the point. See, you said something really smart 
and you are smart. Obviously, you are running 
such a big business. You know, at times I think being rich is a blessing. I wish I was born in your home, and all this would have been mine. Okay, calm down, I am joking.
I am joking. This is a really bad joke. Anyway, tell me, what do you want? Look, the thing Ramsha doesn’t understand,
 even you don’t understand it. And I am not mad, that I lock up my own wife,
in her own room in the house. Look, actually, I wanted to buy a new bike. For that I asked Ramsha to loan 
some money from Mr. Qasim. What hell would have broken loose 
had she asked him? Now obviously, if your wife doesn’t 
understand this issue of yours, it will be a problem. 
Won’t you dislike it? The same thing happened, and then
the rest is in front of you. Fine. You need money for the bike,
I will give it to you. But after that you will never 
bother Ramsha, you won’t worry her. Mr. Afnan, that’s what I am trying 
to make you understand, that I am not mad that 
I torture my wife. You write it. I am writing a cheque for you, but you shouldn’t mention this 
to anyone that I gave you this money. How much money do you need? Make a cheque of one hundred thousand. 
I will return it. Make it for one hundred thousand. No need to return the money. Yes, but in return you can do one thing. Stop torturing Ramsha. She is a really good girl. Only people with good luck 
get such wives. Answer what I am asking you honestly. Did aunt force you to marry Shani 
or was it Alizeh. No one forced me. You are lying. Swear and tell me that
you are not lying. Why should I swear? Do you even trust me swearing? I had also sworn to love you and 
sincerity with you too, you didn’t believe me then, then why are you asking me 
to swear today? Don’t punish yourself for my mistakes, 
Ramsha. Look Afnan, you are living your life like you want. Also let me live my life how I want. Stay away from me.
