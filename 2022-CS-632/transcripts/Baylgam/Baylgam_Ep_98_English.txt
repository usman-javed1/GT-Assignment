Oh, you wanted to discuss with me that you are marrying another girl? What do you think? I would have welcomed you 
in this house. I would have decorated 
this house for you? I would have accepted your marriage? Tell me, is that what you think? No, you wouldn’t have done that. Afnan, everything was going on, then what was the need to get married? You brought that girl to my position 
and made her stand next to me. You gave her your name, why did you do all this? What are you saying? What is wrong with your thinking? You know what is the problem 
with women like you? When your husband is doing 
something unlawful, it doesn't make any difference to you but when they lawfully accepts 
someone and marry them, you women have an objection on that, it doesn’t get up to your standards. What are your standards? That pathetic girl? That TikToker who eloped 
from her house? Enough! Don’t say a word after that, Alizey, she is my wife now. You never got me respected so much, never took a stand like that for me, today you are feeling hurt for her? Afnan, I don’t want to talk to you. Wait a minute. Yes, this is wrong. What? That you cut the call without 
even looking at it. What do you think,
I will doubt you? No but there has to be a question, that will you ever doubt me? To be honest… Wait a minute. Why don’t you attend it? It is not very important to attend the call.
Leave it. tell me, will you ever doubt my love? Umm, do one thing, you talk on the call,
and we will talk later. Hey, no, it is not an important call. Pick up the call. Look I know you are feeling insecure
regarding Ramsha, but I just want to clears that we just had a temporary friendship 
between us which is not there anymore, 
it doesn’t exist. Afnan, I can’t share you with anyone, 
you know it. And that Ramsha wants to take you 
away from me, I know. I know it very well. Please, you won’t leave me, 
Afnan, right? Please don’t leave me, 
I will get mad without you, I am telling you. Yes, yes, Alizey, 
I know you love me a lot but trust me I love you a lot too I can’t even think about anyone
except you and I promise you 
I will never leave you, please take out this insecurity 
from your heart there is nothing between me and 
Ramsha, Alizey, nothing. I am just yours. Just yours. Hello Afnan. When I don’t want to talk to you then why are you continuously calling me 
and bothering me? If I won’t call you, 
who else will I call, Afnan? Call those friends of yours who you have asked to get 
the video viral. Why don’t you believe me, Afnan? I haven’t done anything like that, 
why would I do all this? I don’t even why have she done all this? I don’t trust anyone now. Not even my own self. You haven’t just made me 
lose trust in the world but my own self as well, Ramsha. Afnan, just come home once, 
come home, sit and listen to me, give me 
a chance to speak at least. Please don’t disturb me. I am already going through 
tough times because of you. For God’s sake give me peace 
for a while. I don’t want to talk to you, 
I don’t want to meet you. Now don’t call me again and again. Bye. Afnan? Afnan? Ahmed, did you get to know 
Sir Afnan did second marriage? What are you saying? Sir Afnan did a second marriage?
How do you know it? Not just me, the entire world knows it,
look the video has been viral. Oh yes, this is Sir Afnan. You are responsible for 
this loneliness too. I am surprised that 
an intelligent man like you, how can he make such 
a huge mistake. You married Ramsha. Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys who are family-oriented and rich too, they marry them and that is what Ramsha did too. You are honorable, family-oriented, 
and rich too, she married you and defamed you and then she got famous overnight because that is what she wanted. Afnan I have been calling you for so long,
you are not even picking up my call. I can only explain it to you 
if you pick up my call once. At least give me a chance
to say something. Alizey, I would suggest you join your office. You will at least stop thinking about 
this once you get busy in your routine, else you will get unwell thinking
about all this and look in your condition, doctors strictly ask you not to take tension in 
such a condition. so then what should I do by
going to the office? People will ask me multiple questions there,
 Mom, what will I answer everyone? My colleagues have called me 
so many times just to ask, after all what has Afnan done to you? What should I tell everyone about 
your nephew’s doings? I will be the one facing trouble if I go, everyone will have just one question, why did Afnan marry a TikToker 
and left such a good wife? Enough Alizey, people act very innocent but they are 
not that innocent from within, they know everything and 
they even know that such girls trap honorable boys 
and marry them. And Alizey, you are not the first wife there are thousands of such wives 
going through the same trial. All that is fine Mom but if Afnan doesn’t divorce Ramsha, so I will take separation from Afnan. What kind of a wife are you, Alizey? You don’t know anything about 
what your husband is thinking, what is going on in his heart? 
Why is he worried, show some interest. So what should I do, Mom? If Afnan doesn’t want to share anything
 with me, what is my fault in it? Why are you blaming me for it? Because you are his wife and still you guys have so much 
distance in between, because you never took interest, you just care about your career, your lifestyle, you just focus on yourself. Have you ever focused on your husband? Because you don’t care. So, you are here? What did you think that if you would
hide from me and sit here you wouldn’t have to face me? What is the use? Whenever I come in front of you, 
you shout at me, and get angry, it feels like you cannot tolerate me, so I came here for peace. So didn’t you go to your second wife? Your social media superstar 
Ramsha Khan. By the way, at least ask her which video of yours she plans 
on getting viral next. What do you mean? What are you saying? Go and ask your wife, what other video she plans 
on getting viral. Alizey, did someone say something to you? Why are you saying all this? Answer me why are you 
just looking at me? I am asking you something. I am just watching how big of a 
headache has this second marriage and 
second wife become for you. Look, has someone said something 
to you, Alizey? Whatever you are saying, 
I am unable to understand. Tell me. I forgot, I forgot, I forgot you don’t want peace 
in my life at all and if accidentally I am about
to get some peace in my life, you do something that 
takes the peace away. Afnan, divorce Ramsha. Afnan, I am saying something to you. Afnan? What happened Alizey? 
Why are you doing this? What am I doing? Now what is this another trouble 
you have brought on me after Ramsha? Alizey, talk to me slowly, I am giving you the last warning
 don’t do all this. tell me honestly who was that girl? It's good everyone should know 
how you are cheating on me. Shut up. Just shut up. Get out of this place. Get out of this place right now. You are doubting me? Shall I tell you the truth? No. I am not doubting you at all. Yes, I used to doubt you before when Ramsha was living in our house but since Ramsha has left I am in peace now. If she got married to Shani, she should have compromised 
and lived with him, and Shani has accepted her after 
so much has happened anyway, else who marries such girls? What happened? Why are you 
looking at me like this? Even you rejected her. Yes, I guess that was the biggest mistake
of my life. What is wrong with your thinking? You know what is the problem 
with women like you? When your husband is doing 
something unlawful, it doesn't make any difference to you but when they lawfully accepts 
someone and marry them, you women have an objection on that, it doesn’t get up to your standards. When you can have an affair with 
a girl despite having a wife, so I cannot even question you publicly? Lower your tone when you talk to me. You behave yourself, what do you think you will act strict 
with me and put my voice down? I won’t get quiet at all, I am not here to watch your show. And what do you think, 
you will keep on accusing me and I will accept it in front of everyone? This is your problem, when I come to talk to you, 
you start shouting, misbehaving. so why shouldn’t I shout? 
I will yell even louder, I will tell everyone 
he has betrayed me. I have betrayed you, right? So do one thing, 
don’t live with me but clearly tell me this today, my mind will get clear as well and 
I will make arrangements accordingly. I knew you would come, I knew you would definitely forgive me, you will realize that 
it was not my mistake. Afnan, thank you so much for coming. I am actually innocent, it’s not my fault. Thank you for understanding this. Now what is your plan next? What plan? There is no need to act innocent 
in front of me, what are you about to do next, 
tell me? What plan will I have, I… Ramsha, for God’s sake don’t do 
this drama in front of me, both of you women have made me 
go crazy, but I won’t get crazier now. Where is your phone? Quickly tell me where is your phone? There, it’s there. Afnan?
Enter password, enter password quickly. Why have you kept these Nikkah 
pictures with you? Because it is our pictures… 
So? What do you want? You want to use them against 
me as well? You have kept them 
so you can blackmail me, like you got our shopping video viral, you will do the same with Nikkah 
pictures too, right? Why would I do that? Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife. You got our video viral so people can 
get to know about us, and now you will get these Nikkah 
pictures viral so everyone can know we are married, but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once, what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha? Delete all these. Delete them. In fact, leave it, I have always gotten ditched 
by trusting you. Why are you doing this, Afnan? I don’t trust you anymore, Ramsha, not at all, and where there is no trust, there is nothing at all.
