[37.28] Who do you trust the most 
in the whole world.
[41.20] of course, Afnan.
[44.92] What happened? 
Why are you laughing?
[49.68] He is my husband,
[51.28] off course, if I won’t trust him 
who else will I trust?
[55.52] A person should trust their life partner.
[59.28] Yes, but I would never marry a girl
[62.36] who already has an affair
[64.04] and would be continuing 
after marriage too.
[68.72] What are you trying to say?
[73.48] Please don’t riddle with me.
[77.20] I just have one answer to 
all these riddles.
[85.44] Ramsha.
[93.88] Ramsha used to trust Afnan a lot.
[102.16] First Afnan left her 
then aunt left the world,
[107.56] now she has lost trust in people
[115.16] which is why she is not ready to marry.
[120.68] Afnan?
[123.56] Hmm, Afnan.
[128.76] Ramsha used to love Afnan a lot,
[131.72] she even wanted to marry him
[136.52] but she didn’t have the companionship 
of Afnan in her fate.
[207.48] Ramsha?
[210.40] What are you still doing in this house?
[212.76] Didn’t Uncle ask you to leave?
[223.28] And where are you going by the way.
[231.68] Okay,
[233.36] so you are using Academy as an excuse 
to go meet Afnan, right?
[243.12] You guys have secretly planned to meet 
and hid it from me.
[249.08] There is nothing like that Alizeh, 
I am not going to meet Afnan.
[257.52] I am going to the academy
 with the driver.
[259.84] Don’t lie to me.
[266.52] Afnan has just left for office a while ago
[268.76] and now you are going after him,
[275.08] both of you cannot meet in front of me
[276.92] so you guys have planned to meet 
behind my back, right?
[282.12] I don’t have any answer to all this
 that you are saying, Alizeh.
[291.20] I am getting late, I am going 
to the academy.
[302.28] Agree or don’t, she is definitely 
going to meet Afnan,
[307.92] I won’t spare Afnan today 
if she goes to him.
[328.72] Look, this project is very important for us,
[331.36] that is why, the more work that is done 
on its presentation,
[334.12] it will be better.
[335.36] I want that our company gets 
this contract very soon
[339.12] and if that doesn’t happen, 
it will be a failure on our part
[342.60] so please make sure that.
[345.80] Where is Ramsha, Afnan?
[348.92] Umm, I…
[350.76] Where did you hide Ramsha? 
Where is she?
[354.68] Alizeh? Alizeh, 
what has happened to you?
[357.40] Everyone is watching, 
what are you saying?
[359.24] Afnan, don’t lie to me, 
where is Ramsha?
[361.20] Umm, excuse me, guys,
[363.72] we will resume this meeting
later on, okay?
[365.68] Afnan, I am asking you something. 
Ssshhh.
[373.32] Where have you hide Ramsha?
[374.60] What is wrong with you? 
Have you gone insane?
[376.04] She has come to meet you here, right?
[377.60] Why would Ramsha come to meet me?
 What is wrong with you?
[380.32] Do you even know what did you do 
in front of everyone?
[382.72] What were you showing everyone?
[384.72] You were making a joke out of
 both of us, Alizeh, you…
[387.44] are you in your senses?
[391.36] So then where did she go?
[393.40] Has she gone to the Academy?
[396.36] I don’t know where she is 
but she is not here,
[400.28] you saw it that I was in a meeting 
when you came in
[402.96] but do you realize what you have 
done after coming here.
[406.12] if not about me, at least be careful 
of my position,
[408.68] what was the need of creating 
this scene here?
[412.04] Afnan, I am going to get crazy like this.
[414.84] I will get crazy, Afnan,
[416.92] I feel very insecure.
[419.28] Okay, come here. 
How should I make you…
[421.84] Okay, sit, sit.
How should I make you understand?
[424.12] Please, please, please, 
nothing has happened.
[425.52] Nothing has happened.
[426.52] What will I do if Ramsha 
steals you from me?
[429.36] Nothing like that would happen, 
Please Alizeh listen to me.
[433.00] I know that you are feeling insecure 
regarding Ramsha,
[437.60] but I just want to clear you that
[439.76] we were just friends for the time being 
and we are not anymore,
[444.12] it does not exist at all.
[445.88] Afnan, I cannot share you with anyone, 
you know that right?
[450.28] And that Ramsha wants to take you
away from me, I know that,
[453.76] I know that very well.
[456.20] You won’t leave me, right, Afnan please.
[458.56] Please don’t leave me I cannot live 
with you. I will go mad, I am telling you.
[462.04] Yes, yes Alizeh, 
I know you love me a lot
[465.64] but trust me, I love you a lot too,
[468.48] I cannot even think of anyone except you
[472.08] and I promise you I will never leave you,
[475.36] please take out this fear from your heart.
[478.16] There is nothing between I and Ramsha,
 nothing at all,
[481.40] I am just yours, just yours, Alizeh.
[487.24] Promise me that you won’t leave me.
[490.52] Never ever, never ever.
[495.88] Please relax.
[542.12] Ramsha, my child,
[543.68] your patience has increased your 
respect and ranks in my heart.
[557.92] Indeed, God is with those who are patient,
[564.84] may God grant you the best reward 
for this patience.
[571.24] Amen.
[578.40] Uncle?
[580.04] Yes, my child?
[582.84] May I ask you something?
[585.28] Sure, ask?
[589.64] Is it true that you will let me 
out of this house?
[618.28] Look, my child, I promised 
your late mother,
[623.84] sister Mehnaz, May God forgive her, 
that you are my responsibility
[629.48] and I wanted you to live in this house
[633.52] and wanted to marry you from 
this house like my daughter
[646.48] but I guess fate has other plans.
[661.24] I feel it’s better for this home 
if you leave from here.
[678.36] Now look,
[681.84] Alizeh’s condition is in front of you,
[683.80] I have never seen her yelling 
and crying like this in her life,
[689.04] Afsheen is also very worried 
because of her.
[700.48] Ramsha,
[702.24] like you are my responsibility,
[706.96] my sister and my niece are 
my responsibility too,
[719.32] are you understanding?
[723.40] I understand all your problems.
[734.16] I will accept whatever decision you make.
[739.12] stay blessed.
[795.16] yes, yes, no problem,
[797.24] just let me know the time I will be there.
[801.44] Mom?
[803.04] what am I hearing?
[804.80] Uncle is sending Ramsha to the hostel?
[808.40] I will call you back.
[815.24] Okay, bye.
[819.40] What is your problem?
[821.28] You wanted the same that 
Ramsha leaves this house.
[825.36] Mom, by sending Ramsha out of 
this house I meant that
[828.28] no person from this house should 
stay in contact with her,
[835.84] if uncle sends her to the hostel,
[838.00] Afnan and her way of meeting will
become very easy.
[841.40] What do you mean?
[842.80] It’s pretty clear mom,
[844.12] right now she is in this house 
so she is in front of my eyes,
[846.96] I know if they are meeting or 
not or doing what,
[857.00] they will get a chance behind my back.
[869.40] Why do none of you understand?
[876.64] I want Afnan to get rid of that girl.
[888.80] You are right,
[895.32] give me some time, 
and I will do something.
[937.84] How many sacks of sugar are done?
[941.68] 6 are done.
[944.24] Okay.
[953.64] Greetings.
[962.44] Yes, yes, I will just be there,
[965.16] I will be there. Listen?
[967.48] yes sir? 
Take care I will be back.
[969.28] Okay brother.
[994.48] Greetings.
[995.88] Greetings.
[997.44] You are brother Qasim’s sister, right?
[999.76] Yes, yes.
[1000.92] I wanted to talk to you about 
something important,
[1003.60] will you join me in the car,
[1005.52] I don’t feel it’s appropriate to talk here.
[1008.08] Okay, okay, I will.
[1032.84] Umm,
[1034.40] brother has made Ramsha his daughter.
[1038.24] By the grace of God, by the grace of God.
[1040.76] And you know that
[1042.52] daughters cannot be married 
empty handed.
[1046.08] Indeed, indeed.
[1050.52] What do they say?
[1052.92] Hint is enough for an intelligent person
[1061.60] and you seem to be quite intelligent
to me by face.
[1066.24] Thank you.
[1069.80] You are Ramsha’s uncle
[1072.12] and who can have more right 
on Ramsha than you?
[1076.84] yes.
[1173.36] Mom?
[1175.28] Mom?
[1176.16] Yes, why are you making 
so much noise? What is it?
[1179.28] Dad called, he was saying that 
Mr. Qasim’s sister is coming
[1182.12] so clean the drawing room.
[1184.44] Mr. Qasim’s sister? 
Why is she coming?
[1188.68] Dad didn’t tell that.
[1192.40] First his niece came now his sister.
[1197.12] Dad was saying that send brother 
to get refreshment
[1200.72] and I will clean the drawing meanwhile,
[1202.60] you can call brother, okay?
[1214.64] First his niece came now his sister,
[1218.96] there is definitely something,
[1223.32] they cannot come without a purpose,
[1227.12] there must be some purpose.
[1253.20] Dad, when I was telling you 
to send Ramsha to the hostel,
[1256.20] you didn’t listen to me,
[1258.36] now you are sending her 
to the hostel yourself,
[1260.76] please don’t do that.
[1268.72] Things were different back then,
[1271.88] now situation is different.
[1274.20] Dad if you think asking Ramsha to leave
 this house is the solution of the problem,
[1278.52] then your thinking is wrong.
[1293.28] You should make Alizeh understand
[1300.16] that she should control her anger, 
we can control this situation, dad.
[1305.40] I have taken this decision 
after a lot of thinking.
[1320.76] Mr. Ahmed’s wife runs that hostel,
[1324.28] she is a nice mature woman,
[1330.84] I am satisfied and I trust her,
[1334.24] you don’t have to worry at all.
[1336.60] How should I not worry, dad?
[1339.44] Ramsha feels so secure here,
[1352.88] do you think if she leaves this place 
and goes to the hostel,
[1355.28] will she feel the same amount of safety?
[1357.56] And when she will be under the pressure
[1359.48] that she has no one familiar around her, 
her studies will be affected too.
[1362.92] I have made the decision, Afnan.
[1382.76] Your decision is wrong, Dad.
[1395.20] Okay,
[1398.16] look into your own collar,
[1407.36] I wish you would have realized 
your mistakes
[1411.36] so we wouldn’t have come 
to this situation.
[1424.60] It is better that you leave 
my decisions to me.
[1458.64] You haven’t left me capable 
to face my sister and niece.
[1466.92] Today the strict decisions that 
I have to take,
[1470.00] I never wanted to do them
[1474.32] and you have forced me
[1481.88] so I have decided that
[1484.44] Ramsha will no longer live
in this house now.
[1487.00] When I am the one at fault
[1488.72] then you cannot punish Ramsha
[1490.52] for my mistake by putting her 
through this
[1493.12] and just imagine where will 
the poor girl go from here?
[1495.80] Her own home is not safe for her.
[1498.48] I have said that Ramsha won’t 
live here anymore.
[1503.68] Yes Dad but I am telling you 
that if you just once…
[1505.88] I won’t listen to you anymore now, Afnan.
[1510.60] I have told you that Ramsha 
won’t live here now,
[1513.16] so, she won’t.
[1518.12] It is better if we don’t talk 
about this anymore.
[1521.88] Leave for now.
[1548.40] Mom,
[1551.00] why are you worried since so long?
[1553.48] You have been so worried ever 
since Mr. Qasim’s sister left,
[1558.20] after all why did she come? 
What did she say?
[1564.88] She wants me and your dad
[1567.92] to go to Mr. Qasim’s house for 
Ramsha’s marriage proposal.
[1572.64] That is what she was here to say?
[1575.24] Yes.
[1577.88] Didn’t you tell her that Ramsha would
never marry brother?
[1582.04] She doesn’t like brother at all,
[1584.08] if she would, she would have 
never left this house.
[1588.88] This is the problem,
[1592.56] I openly told everything to her but
[1598.08] she is still persistent
[1601.76] that we should come there with 
Ramsha’s proposal once.
[1606.96] Dad must have given them 
piece of their mind.
[1609.20] That is what I am surprised about
[1611.76] that your dad didn’t say anything to him
[1614.32] in fact ensured them that
[1616.68] we will definitely go with Ramsha’s 
proposal to Mr. Qasim’s house.
[1620.80] What?
[1624.52] I don’t know what he wants, 
I don’t understand,
[1629.68] he agreed to it only when Mr. Qasim’s sister 
asked him once,
[1637.36] there is definitely something fishy.
[1643.08] Mom, dad might have had some mercy 
for Ramsha after sister in law’s death
[1650.52] and he might have become 
sincere with her.
[1652.56] No,
[1655.20] if your dad was that sincere with Ramsha,
[1659.92] then sister-in-law and Ramsha 
wouldn’t have left this house,
[1664.72] I am very well aware of your Dad.
[1673.48] There is definitely something.
[1702.88] Madam Ramsha, do you need me 
to do anything else?
[1704.64] No nothing, that’s it, 
thank you, you may go.
[1717.08] Come in.
[1723.88] What is going on?
What are you doing?
[1727.96] Preparations to leave this house.
[1731.72] You are not going to do anything like this.
You are not going anywhere.
[1735.40] I have to leave this house one day, Afnan,
[1744.12] and the kind of the ongoing situation 
in the house,
[1747.32] it is better if I leave on my own,
[1754.12] else I will be kicked out from here.
[1757.28] I am telling you to leave this, 
you are not going anywhere.
[1762.80] What is wrong with you?
[1769.16] What do you think
[1771.12] that whatever you say and whatever
you think will be right?
[1781.60] What happens by you saying 
anything, Afnan?
[1783.88] What is my relationship with you 
that you are giving me orders?
[1786.92] Look, the reason why you are leaving
 this house,
[1789.12] is of no use,
[1791.48] if you think it will make any difference 
to Alizeh if you leave,
[1795.24] nothing will fix or get right.
[1799.68] I know that,
[1801.76] I know that it wouldn’t make difference 
to anyone if I leave,
[1806.28] nothing will get fixed but I still have 
to leave from here Afnan.
[1809.56] Ramsha, why don’t you understand?
[1811.52] Why don’t you understand Afnan?
[1819.48] Today, because of me,
[1821.36] because of me you stood in front of uncle.
[1830.52] You have caused so much pain 
and hurt to uncle.
[1840.44] You have never done any favor 
on me Afnan,
[1846.88] but uncle has done a lot of favors on me,
[1855.96] and I will never tolerate that 
someone speaks
[1859.28] against the one who did me favor,
 or hurt him.
[1862.04] Okay, I know,
[1863.72] I know I shouldn’t have spoken to Dad
like this but I got angry
[1867.72] because he wasn’t understanding 
what I was saying
[1871.28] or I guess I wasn’t able to explain 
my point of view to him.
[1874.56] But you relax,
[1876.36] this matter is between myself and Dad,
[1878.08] I will make him understand, 
and he will agree
[1881.20] but you don’t need to go anywhere.
[1895.56] I am telling you that 
you cannot go anywhere.
[1897.84] what are you doing, Afnan?
[1900.56] What do you think of me?
[1908.80] What do you think?
[1910.60] What do you think that whatever 
you are thinking and saying is all right?
[1913.84] Why don’t you understand?
[1916.08] I cannot trust anyone 
when it comes to you.
[1922.24] Since when did I become so important?
[1935.32] It is not about being important or not,
[1941.56] the thing is that I don’t want you
to go away from here,
[1946.04] this place is very safe for you, 
you are safe here,
[1955.32] and don’t worry about Alizeh, 
I will make her understand,
[1964.56] I am telling you trust me.
[1968.16] What do you think?
[1969.96] What do you think that you will take
all my life decisions
[1973.32] and I will agree to them?
[1976.12] You have always listened to me, Ramsha.
[1979.92] That is the reason 
why I am suffering today.
[1982.92] I agree that some of my decisions
have brought you to this point
[1989.60] but I can only regret
[1993.08] that I wish I had understood you 
at that time.
[1996.76] I cannot see anything bad happening 
to you Ramsha,
[2000.00] trust me.
[2003.28] I trusted you once before as well,
[2007.32] what happened then?
[2118.92] Mr. Faisal? Umm,
[2123.36] why is he calling at this time?
[2128.40] I am sure there must be 
something important,
[2130.36] I don’t know where has Afnan gone.
[2134.24] Afnan?
[2168.68] Why did Afnan go up?
[2175.80] I am sure he has met Ramsha.
[2187.76] Why don’t you understand?
[2190.08] I cannot trust anyone 
when it comes to you.
[2194.64] since when did I become so important?
[2201.40] It is not about being important or not,
[2207.72] the thing is that
[2210.12] I don’t want you to go away from here,
[2213.28] this place is very safe for you, 
you are safe here,
[2217.12] you shouldn’t go to your home, 
you know that and I know that too,
[2220.48] and don’t worry about Alizeh,
[2222.44] I will make her understand, 
I am telling you trust me.
[2226.80] What do you think?
[2228.68] What do you think that 
you will take all my life decisions
[2232.12] and I will agree to them?
[2236.56] You have always listened to me,
Ramsha.
[2239.68] That is the reason 
why I am suffering today.
[2241.88] I agree that some of my decisions 
have brought you to this point
[2248.16] but I can only regret
[2251.64] that I wish I had understood 
you at that time.
[2256.48] I cannot see anything bad happening 
to you Ramsha,
[2259.68] trust me.
[2262.52] I trusted you once before as well,
[2266.68] what happened then?
[2305.44] What happened Afnan?
[2315.08] Aren’t you sleepy?
[2317.92] You care so much about Ramsha
that you have lost your sleep?
[2332.88] Yes, I am concerned for Ramsha.
