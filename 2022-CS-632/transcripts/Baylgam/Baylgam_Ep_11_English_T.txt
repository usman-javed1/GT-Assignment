[15.96] The personality we will make you 
meet today,
[19.08] all of you want to meet her.
[21.68] Yes, you people must have understood.
[24.08] We will make you all meet Ramsha.
[26.56] Come please, in your huge applause.
[37.76] Greetings.
[39.12] Greetings.
[40.32] How are you?
[41.24] I am absolutely fine. 
How are you?
[42.44] I am fine. Really pretty 
since childhood,
[45.48] I have never been proud of it. 
Aunty, how are you?
[47.88] Yes, I am fine too.
[49.80] Great. We welcome you two 
to our show.
[52.64] mama. Mama.
[54.64] Hey, what happened? 
Why are you making noise?
[56.64] Mama it is 9 am, 
what are you doing here?
[58.64] The morning show must have begun.
[60.12] Ramsha looks really pretty.
[61.44] I thought you would be watching the show.
[62.68] Hey, it is 9 am? I didn’t realize 
while working.
[64.44] Come on switch on the TV quickly.
[65.84] Turn on the TV quickly.  
We will watch the show.
[68.72] Quickly. Oh God.
[70.80] Where is it? I don’t see the remote.
[72.60] I don’t know where Shani kept the remote,
 the time will pass.
[76.16] You know, Ramsha looks really pretty, 
it feels like an actress is sitting.
[79.08] And elder mama also looks really pretty.
[81.16] Really?
Here it is.
[82.12] Good you told me or I wouldn’t have
 realized while working.
[88.24] Hey, don’t sit. Take this. 
Go quickly.
[90.56] Let me watch, mama
[91.76] Go, turn off the stove. 
The rice is on it.
[93.84] Aunty, you have left Ramsha 
behind as well.
[97.48] Your make over is really good.
[99.12] And our makeup artist doesn’t do 
such good makeup on us,
[102.04] they did a good job on aunty.
[103.52] Ramsha, how does it feel over night…
[106.08] See, sister in law Mehnaz 
looks so pretty.
[110.08] I feel along with Ramsha, 
they have done her make up too.
[114.16] Yes, a great makeup did their makeup.
[117.56] I spoke to Ramsha before the show started.
[119.96] What is the name?
[121.08] I will tell you after the break. 
Right now watch the show.
[123.88] She was saying she wanted to come 
to my show to take selfies.
[126.12] Oh wow, great. Aunt, how do you feel?
[129.32] Your daughter has got so much fame. 
What do you think?
[132.68] Yes, since childhood 
she had an interest,
[135.88] we used to stop her.
[138.40] But now she has so much fame.
[143.48] Everyone recognizes her.
[152.16] Hey, then what?
[153.68] I insulted them badly.
[155.28] They said this is our makeup artist,
[157.36] he will do Ramsha’s makeup.
[158.76] Boy.
[159.96] I told them don’t you dare have a male
 makeup artist does my daughter’s makeup.
[163.88] You know Salma, 
there is a shameless fashion,
[166.92] boys do the makeup.
[168.88] Oh God, God forbid.
[170.32] Sister in law, you did good.
[172.64] You did good that you insulted them.
[174.92] There is one thing, Salma.
[177.20] Those people welcomed us a lot.
[180.08] Hey, they treated us so well, 
what do I tell you?
[184.64] They made us sit 
in a separate AC room.
[188.40] The people who sit in the audience 
and clap,
[192.12] they were sitting separately.
[193.48] But they made us sit 
in a separate AC room
[196.76] and her assistant would come 
to me again and again
[200.48] and ask me if I want, tea, 
coffee, juice, water.
[205.44] Hey, the breakfast they got us.
[207.92] Nothing was missing in that breakfast.
[210.52] They really served us well.
[212.76] I really liked watching it all.
[215.16] Really sister in law?
[216.20] Yes, if you were there then you would
have seen everything with your eyes.
[218.96] Hey, I really wanted to go.
[221.84] I had so much fun. 
Yes, the clothes
[224.56] they gave us to wear were so grand, 
what do I tell you.
[239.60] Yes, so? Did you not see,
[242.20] I played two games with sister Shiza
[244.32] and you know we took so many selfies,
[246.88] we talked so much, 
that you cannot imagine.
[249.68] You know she was telling me 
that I am really talented
[252.32] and I can also be a good actress
in future.
[255.36] What? Acting?
[258.00] Talk slowly.
[259.04] If mama and aunt hear you, 
it will be an issue.
[262.28] Yes, she was saying
[264.28] that after seeing this interview, 
I will get a lot of acting offers.
[268.72] Ramsha, it was fine till 
the morning show,
[272.28] but you don’t think about acting.
[274.48] What is wrong, Annie?
[276.16] You know when I was there…
[308.24] Afnan, I am serious.
[310.68] Hey, if you didn’t have time 
you could have seen it in repeat.
[314.20] You know my happiness 
doesn’t matter to you,
[317.24] I have seen it.
[319.84] Hey, I don’t understand how do you
 find happiness in such things.
[327.36] Okay fine, for your happiness,
[329.24] you do one thing, send me 
the link of that show,
[332.48] I will watch it.
[334.60] Hey, now I send you the link, even?
[337.16] If I don’t send you the link 
you wont watch it?
[339.84] Hey talking to you is like talking 
to a small child.
[344.16] You know I have no interest
 in these things.
[346.60] I have no interest.
[348.24] If you send me the link it will be
 easy for me to watch it.
[352.36] Fine, I will send it.
[355.44] But do watch it, please. 
Don’t forget.
[388.76] Ramsha, I couldn’t recognize you.
[393.00] You know, you have so many chances
 to move forward.
[396.28] I would say stay in contact 
with these media people,
[399.12] you will see you will get such good offers.
[401.56] I want that too, but you know my family.
[405.80] I got permission to go to the morning show
with so much difficulty,
[408.84] how will they let me act?
[411.96] So tell your mother and father,
[414.76] to change themselves and 
their thinking
[417.40] because this is something
 ordinary nowadays.
[420.00] This happening is impossible.
[421.88] It is not possible that my family’s 
thinking changes.
[425.64] Okay listen,
[427.24] I have a cousin Shahmir.
[429.44] He has a modeling agency. 
Maybe you have heard the name.
[432.20] He needs a beautiful model 
for a new project he is launching.
[436.72] If you want, I can talk to him. 
Because he really liked you.
[446.36] Me? Modeling?
[448.96] Me and modeling? 
How is that possible Hania?
[452.32] Yes, so what is the harm in that?
[455.60] So what if you do a photoshoot 
for one magazine?
[459.08] And if you want you can also 
hide this from your parents.
[464.56] Because he is giving a 
really good package.
[470.60] Hania…
[471.52] The offer is really good, 
rest is up to you.
[475.20] Hania, modeling, hiding 
from mama and papa?
[480.44] No, no, I cannot do that.
[482.52] I don’t do anything hiding it from them
and it is not possible.
[488.28] Yes, so Ramsha,
[489.84] you will not come on the TV screen,
[492.40] that they will find out everything.
[495.12] It is just a small photoshoot.
[497.56] Rest I will stay with you,
[499.72] why do you have to worry?
[512.20] Okay, I will bring juice for you.
[515.52] Don’t worry.
[563.56] Ramsha.
[565.12] Ramsha, where did you…
[566.80] Ramsha, where did you keep 
my economics book?
[569.48] Ramsha, where is my economics book?
[571.76] I am asking you something.
[573.44] What is the problem?
[575.20] A person cannot calmly think about 
something in this home.
[577.76] Where is my economics book?
[581.12] It is kept on the side table in my room,
go take it and don’t bother me.
[587.76] By the way,
[589.48] why are you lost in deep thoughts?
[595.28] I am asking you. 
What are you thinking?
[597.36] hey, I am not thinking anything. 
Go get your book and don’t bother me.
[603.04] I am sure something is going on 
in your head.
[610.36] God knows, what you will do now, 
but you are surely thinking of something.
[627.44] The day spent talking about 
the Prophet are the best days,
[632.04] the days spent in the memories 
of the Prophet,
[634.80] there is no better night than that.
[638.32] I spent great time.
[643.68] All the worldly blessings given 
by God on one side,
[647.88] but the most precious thing 
that a person has is their time
[653.16] and then that time that is spent 
for God thinking about God
[658.28] is greater than all blessings.
[667.44] Believe me,
[669.00] you get to learn at every step,
[671.44] you get a chance to improve yourself.
[677.00] I am going to turn sixty
[680.04] and I was making mistakes 
in my namaz, for years.
[683.72] I didn’t realize it.
[686.36] Going there I realized that the knowledge
 of the religion is so important.
[692.48] These responsibilities of ours,
[695.80] we should be able to fulfill them properly,
[698.32] but it will only be possible
[700.32] when we find out about them, we try.
[707.28] We make effort.
[709.08] In fact, Afnan, I will tell you as well,
[712.12] what is left lacking in my life,
[714.76] shouldn’t be left lacking in your life.
[724.88] You too gain knowledge of the religion.
[728.04] In fact, Mr. Awais was telling me he has 
started some small courses in the evening,
[732.72] so you do a small course.
[736.52] Yes, dad. I will try my best.
[744.84] Afsheen, I was saying that we should
 get Afnan and Alizay married now.
[749.72] It is a good deed, we shouldn’t delay it.
What do you say?
[765.28] Absolutely right, brother.
[767.24] Alizay is your daughter.
[772.68] After all, she doesn’t have to go 
to another home after marriage.
[779.12] Uncle.
[781.20] I am sorry uncle.
[791.16] I am not ready to get married right now.
[802.84] I need some time.
[804.44] Right now, I am focusing on my career.
[810.28] That’s why I cannot get married.
[823.60] Excuse me.
[826.20] Alizay, child, listen to me.
[835.56] Brother, you know Alizay is a child 
right now.
[842.24] Hearing about her marriage 
she got a little confused.
[845.96] But you don’t worry, 
I will make her understand.
[849.80] Afnan, you don’t worry at all.
[854.56] You and Alizay will be married soon.
[872.56] Brother, I will go check on her.
[911.52] Ramsha,
[913.84] look, if you think so much,
then believe me,
[917.16] you wont be able to do anything 
in your life.
[920.88] People have to progress 
so much in life.
[924.44] They want everything in life.
[927.16] Money, wealth, fame. Everything.
[929.96] And you?
[931.28] You are getting all this easily,
[934.00] then why are you thinking so much?
[936.28] People have to make so much effort 
to get to this point,
[940.60] they have to put in hard work,
[942.36] they have to ask people for work 
at different place,
[944.56] and you?
[945.60] You are thinking so much.
[948.48] You know, before today, 
I was never this scared in life,
[951.88] like I got scared today.
[953.56] My papa really loves me. 
He loves me a lot.
[956.72] But he is equally angry 
as he loves me.
[959.84] I am scared that if someone 
in my home finds out a little,
[965.00] then I am a goner. 
They will take my life.
[968.44] No one will find out anything.
[971.84] Okay tell me,
[973.36] does your family read the magazines?
[977.12] No.
[979.00] Does anyone read the newspaper?
Do you get a newspaper?
[982.48] Yes, but no one reads it.
[985.04] This photoshoot is for a fashion magazine,
[989.28] that your family wont see. 
Then what is the issue?
[992.80] You know cousin is offering you
three hundred thousand for this photoshoot.
[1000.24] Three hundred thousand 
for a photoshoot?
[1002.88] Three hundred thousand. 
I spoke to him myself.
[1006.00] He gives an ordinary model
one hundred and fifty thousand.
[1009.80] And you?
[1011.08] You are the shopping girl,
[1012.88] he is offering you three hundred thousand 
himself.
[1016.52] So what is the issue?
[1019.56] Look, think about this
[1021.88] and I want an answer today,
[1024.32] because I have to give him 
the final answer today.
[1042.64] Alizay,
[1045.00] what career do you want to make?
[1048.32] Afnan and brother have
their own business
[1051.76] and all this will be yours.
[1053.92] Then why are you wasting 
your time making your career?
[1056.92] Mama, why don’t you understand,
[1059.20] I never want to be dependent on anyone.
[1062.80] I want to make a name for myself.
[1065.24] And God forbid, 
if I become alone in future,
[1068.00] I don’t want that like you I have to live 
on uncle’s support or someone’s support.
[1072.20] What are you saying, Alizay?
[1074.48] Think what you are saying 
before you speak.
[1078.48] Mama, try and understand.
[1082.68] I know uncle didn’t leave 
you deprived of anything
[1087.00] and he never showed his favour to you
 that you live with him.
[1091.64] But the world is not like uncle
[1094.96] and to walk in this world it is necessary 
for me make myself strong.
[1100.04] When am I saying that 
I will not get married?
[1102.28] I love Afnan myself, mama.
[1104.80] I am just asking you for some time.
[1108.72] Alizay,
[1110.84] have you thought?
[1112.56] What will you do, if Afnan likes some
 other girl in the time you are asking for?
[1119.80] Why are you laughing? 
I am not joking.
[1122.84] Mama, what you are saying 
is no less than a joke.
[1126.48] Mama, Afnan can give his life for me.
[1131.52] He cannot go far from me.
[1134.08] Where are you Afnan?
[1135.60] Yes, I am in the office.
 Why? All okay?
[1139.80] Yes, I actually wanted to go out
[1142.60] so brother took the car and went, 
so I thought I would go with you.
[1146.76] Oh, I am really busy, 
I have back to back meetings.
[1151.56] If you want I will coordinate with the driver,
he will come to you.
[1154.92] No, no, it is alright, 
I will manage.
[1157.40] Goodbye.
[1164.00] Mama.
[1170.52] Alizay,
[1172.28] There are a lot of girls who can give
 their lives for a capable,
[1179.52] rich and handsome boy.
[1183.48] Try and understand what I am saying.
[1210.52] Sit here.
[1216.92] Now tell me, what were you saying?
[1219.76] What would I say?
[1221.80] But, it was fine till the morning show,
[1225.76] this modeling…elder mama, 
elder papa will never agree.
[1228.72] Nothing will happen, Annie.
No one will find out anything.
[1231.36] I will just got two to three hours,
[1233.04] and my shoot will end 
in two to three hours.
[1234.92] I will go during university time 
and Hania is coming with me.
[1237.48] You know how much money 
I am getting for this shoot?
[1241.56] I am getting three hundred thousand 
for this shoot.
[1244.68] Who is telling you that you are getting 
three hundred thousand?
[1247.60] You think I am stupid?
[1249.48] I spoke to Hania completely.
[1251.68] She told me that she will come 
with me during university timing
[1254.36] and I am just telling you all this,
[1256.36] that once the class is over 
you look around for me.
[1259.56] You have to wait for me.
[1261.36] I will get the shoot done and come back,
 and we will come together like we do daily.
[1264.80] If you don’t care about yourself, 
but care about me.
[1267.04] Even if someone finds out, 
we will get beaten so badly,
[1269.44] that you cannot imagine.
[1271.08] You are not going anywhere, sit here.
[1272.68] I am not asking you, I am telling you
[1275.12] and if you don’t want to come 
with me, then don’t.
[1278.28] I cannot live this life, it is clear.
[1282.52] I have to kill my wishes in this.
[1285.76] I have to do this shoot and move forward. 
I have to make my future Annie.
[1289.00] Ramsha, God has given you 
so many blessings.
[1293.12] People don’t even have these. 
Thank God.
[1297.12] I don’t want to argue with you 
on anything.
[1299.08] I have decided that I am getting 
the shoot done for the magazine,
[1302.28] so this means I am getting it done.
[1306.68] Think about it.
[1320.44] Afnan,
[1321.76] it is good I found you here. 
I was coming to talk to you.
[1324.60] I too wanted to talk to you too.
[1326.80] And Alizay I want that
[1329.24] you not only listen to me, 
but also accept it.
[1332.92] Afnan, you know you cannot 
boss me around.
[1337.28] Yes, you can surely request me,
[1339.80] I will also listen to you
[1342.28] and if I understand, 
I might accept it too.
[1345.04] Why are you doing this?
[1348.00] What do you want?
[1350.92] Alizay, you have every blessing 
in the world.
[1353.76] If you want something, then tell me,
I will put it in your feet.
[1357.56] But don’t do all this.
[1360.20] Afnan, please,
[1361.96] what are you saying?
[1366.00] These things sound good in books,
but in practical life?
[1369.28] All this doesn’t work in practical life
[1371.48] and I was coming to you that I am going
 to Islamabad for a month from the office.
[1376.96] I have got an approval letter.
[1380.84] What?
[1385.32] You are going to Islamabad and 
you are telling me this right now.
[1390.00] What is wrong, Afnan? 
Why are you reacting like this?
[1393.28] I wanted to surprise everyone 
on the dining table,
[1395.76] but uncle was talking 
so I couldn’t speak.
[1398.48] I thought you would be happy…
I don’t care.
[1402.80] I don’t care what you were thinking
[1406.52] and you know what?
[1409.00] You are the most selfish person 
in the world,
[1413.32] who doesn’t see anything about 
anyone in front of your happiness.
[1418.76] Hey, if someone is getting pain from you 
or they are tortured,
[1423.20] it doesn’t matter to you.
[1427.12] You want to go to Islamabad, right?
[1429.40] You leave.
[1431.44] Hey not for a month, go for a year, 
if you want you can go for all your life,
[1437.40] it doesn’t matter to me now.
[1463.68] Okay.
[1465.12] Okay Hania, fine, tell them 
I am reaching in a little while.
[1468.16] Yes, I will come in a little while.
[1470.44] Okay, bye. Goodbye. Come on.
[1473.92] You wont learn.
[1475.44] Why?
[1477.48] You are jealous of me?
[1479.24] You are jealous that I am getting 
three hundred thousand?
[1482.12] What? I will be jealous of your money?
[1485.56] You said something cheap, Ramsha.
[1488.52] Okay Annie, what is wrong?
[1490.52] Okay, let’s do one thing,
[1492.04] the three hundred thousand I get, 
I will give you ten thousand out of it, okay?
[1496.04] Thank you very much, 
I don’t want your ten thousand.
[1499.64] Okay,
[1500.92] lets do one thing,
[1502.84] I will take you shopping and 
you can buy what you want,
[1506.48] I will pay the bill.
[1513.32] What?
[1514.76] Now I cannot give you the entire 
three hundred thousand, madam.
[1517.64] You get over. Come on. Come on.
Ramsha,
[1521.20] I have no interest in your money,
[1523.64] but I am just trying to make you 
understand to be smart.
[1527.00] If elder papa finds out 
he will break your legs.
[1531.00] If my brother and papa find out,
they will cut my throat.
[1535.52] Ramsha. Hey…
[1538.12] Mama, I was coming to tell you
[1540.40] that I will come a little late.
[1541.68] Because I have a practical 
after the classes.
[1543.48] Annie will get off soon, so Annie 
will come home herself. Okay, Annie?
[1546.72] Okay, call me, I will send your father, 
come with him.
[1550.52] You don’t need to come alone.
[1552.12] No mama!
[1553.96] I mean, what is the need 
to inform papa?
[1557.92] He is on the shop at that time. 
He will worry for no reason.
[1561.76] I will have my friends with me, 
they will drop me back after the practical.
[1566.84] Okay, you two are getting late, come on, go.
[1568.80] Come on. Come on Annie.
Goodbye, mama.
[1570.48] Goodbye.
Goodbye. May God protect you.
[1584.56] I was coming to you that I am going
to Islamabad for a month from the office.
[1590.16] I have got an approval letter.
[1594.00] What?
[1598.88] You are going to Islamabad and 
you are telling me this right now.
[1603.28] What is wrong, Afnan? 
Why are you reacting like this?
[1606.44] I wanted to surprise everyone 
on the dining table,
[1608.88] but uncle was talking 
so I couldn’t speak.
[1611.60] I thought you would be happy…
I don’t care.
[1615.88] I don’t care what you were thinking.
[1631.04] Don’t think so much, 
your breakfast is getting cold.
[1640.80] Afnan,
[1643.92] please try to understand.
[1651.44] You are asking me to understand.
[1654.00] This means you have decided to go, 
you wont stop.
[1660.40] Okay, you don’t get upset with me.
[1662.84] How can I not get upset?
[1665.56] I asked you so many times, 
you don’t go.
[1668.40] My heart doesn’t agree. 
But you…
[1671.92] You know, you take undue advantage
of my love
[1675.76] and I am telling you that 
if you don’t stop , then I…
[1681.12] Then what?
[1683.48] What man? What can I do?
[1689.36] I can do nothing with you.
[1692.08] I love you.
Afnan,
[1695.44] you know what I like the most 
about you?
[1699.60] No matter how upset you are with me, 
you cannot leave me.
[1704.20] And see,
[1705.76] I was thinking that 
you will understand me,
[1709.72] in fact, you will also make
 mama understand.
[1716.56] This is a big opportunity for me.
[1719.48] I don’t want to miss it.
[1722.00] It is just a matter of a month.
[1723.72] I will come back immediately 
after getting the work done.
[1729.56] Please Afnan, please.
[1736.80] Please.
[1741.12] Okay, have breakfast.
[1743.12] Will you have tea?
Yes. Give it.
[1747.08] Have you seen such a future husband,
[1748.76] who even after fighting so much….
[1799.60] Perfect.
[1801.48] Your face, your looks are perfect 
for the camera.
[1811.00] We were looking for such a girl.
[1813.96] I had talked to Hania that call this girl,
she has talent.
[1818.92] That is why…
[1822.48] Hey, I took her name and she is calling.
She has a long life.
[1825.32] Yes, Hania.
[1826.56] Yes, Shahmir, how are you?
[1828.56] I am fine and the madam is sitting
in front of me.
[1832.16] I am talking to her.
[1834.00] The girl you sent is really good.
[1836.92] I really liked her.
[1840.32] That’s why I introduced you to Ramsha.
[1842.76] Shahmir, Ramsha has a lot of talent.
[1845.08] I would say if she comes in this field, 
she will leave all the other girls behind.
[1849.44] Yes, you know,
[1850.80] all the famous actors and models 
who work with out famous agency,
[1855.64] where they are today.
[1858.56] You remember Alisha?
[1860.24] Yes, yes, I remember her.
[1861.92] No one knew her, I did her first shoot 
with my own hands.
[1869.24] Yes.
[1871.84] Fine.
[1874.48] Fine, okay, I will talk to her 
about business.
[1877.80] Okay fine, perfect.
[1879.60] Okay bye.
[1882.64] Alisha.
[1883.68] She is a big actress. 
Did you do her first shoot?
[1888.52] Yes,
[1890.44] she came to me first time, 
no one knew her.
[1894.28] I did her shoot myself and today, 
see, she is earning millions.
[1901.00] This is what happens in this field.
[1903.00] If you go and ask her if she knows me,
[1907.24] she will refuse it.
[1909.20] Because when people get a name,
[1911.44] they refused to recognize others.
[1913.92] This is the biggest issue of this field.
[1918.00] You wont do this with me, right?
[1920.20] No, no, I am not like that.
[1923.04] When someone does a favor on me, 
I never forget their favor.
[1928.16] Good. Anyway,
[1930.80] now it is time for a friend of mine to come,
I have to spend time with him.
[1933.76] So I want that we do the shoot 
after that.
[1936.56] Let me call Fiza.
[1939.52] Yes, Fiza, come inside. Yeah.
[1947.52] Yes, come in.
[1950.36] Yes, sir.
Yes, Fiza, you know she is.
[1955.12] Yes, sir, who doesn’t know her?
[1956.68] She is really famous by the name 
of shopping girl.
[1959.92] Then you take her and make her ready.
[1961.96] I will meet you people after the meeting.
[1963.92] We have to do the shoot.
[1965.76] Come on, Miss Ramsha.
Sure.
[1978.36] The mobile is really good, man. 
When did you get it? Is it new.
[1982.00] You know your brother never 
gets anything used.
[1984.24] I got a new box packed piece 
for sixty thousand rupees.
[1988.04] You got a mobile for sixty thousand?
[1991.12] You know the prices of mobiles 
are increasing daily.
[1994.08] I liked the camera of it, so I got it.
[2000.80] What do I tell you? 
Even I want to change my mobile.
[2003.24] I had showed my mobile to a friend,
[2005.64] he told me take thirty thousand for it.
[2008.00] But now if I have to get such a mobile,
[2010.12] where will I get the remaining 
thirty thousand from?
[2012.40] If I ask papa, there is no chance
[2015.08] and there is nothing happening 
at the shop, it is the end of the month,
[2018.88] how will it happen?
[2021.16] Look brother, I got a contract 
for one fifty thousand.
[2024.12] And I need a helper
[2026.04] and you can also do the work 
of an electrician.
[2028.12] What do you say? 
Will you come along with me?
[2030.08] What do you mean? 
I come along with you?
[2032.40] Then who will take care of the shop?
[2033.96] Oh man, papa is there.
[2035.80] Papa and uncle will handle it together.
[2037.44] It is a matter of two to three days,
[2039.16] and I will give you thirty thousand 
for this work.
[2042.60] You will give me thirty thousand 
for this job?
[2044.60] |Hey, yes, you are my friend.
[2047.92] If I don’t do it for you, 
then who will I do it for?
[2050.00] You have time till the evening. 
Tell me as soon as possible.
[2053.92] I will tell you. 
Show me your phone.
[2059.56] Thank God, buddy, 
you showed me your face.
[2062.28] Or else everyone just calls 
when they need me.
[2065.08] You disappeared like in university, 
we were…
[2069.04] you know what they say? 
The horns on a donkey.
[2073.24] There is nothing like that, buddy.
[2075.76] You know dad has put all the responsibility
 of the business on me.
[2080.84] I spend my entire day in the office.
[2083.08] I don’t have four brothers like you
[2085.24] that if one brother is not there, 
the other will come.
[2087.16] It is just me.
[2088.88] Should I work or 
should I meet friends?
[2091.40] Leave it, man.
[2093.64] This love of brothers.
[2096.24] Nowadays, everyone is concerned 
about themselves,
[2098.28] no one belongs to anyone.
[2100.16] This is just words.
[2102.92] A person should be like you,
[2106.08] completely free, relaxed.
[2108.40] These talks of family,
[2110.68] the issues with each other,
it is a lot of tension.
[2114.32] What can I say?
[2115.56] I think no person is happy 
in their place.
[2119.00] What do I say, man? 
That’s it.
[2134.88] Listen, can I see this?
[2137.64] Yes. Yes. Do you even need to ask?
[2145.08] Who is this girl?
[2147.16] My new model.
[2153.08] Maybe you would have seen her video.
[2155.64] She is really viral by the name 
of Shopping girl.
[2161.60] Coincidentally she is in the studio 
right now.
[2164.88] You know how much I need such girls.
[2173.72] They want fame and I want profit.
[2185.00] Anyway, you tell me, 
do you know her?
[2188.56] Me?
[2191.24] How would I know her?
[2193.76] I have no relation with these models.
[2198.76] I may have seen the viral video 
you are mentioning.
[2204.92] The face seemed familiar.
[2207.48] Yes, it is right.
[2212.84] Okay listen, I will leave.
[2215.36] Dad must be waiting, 
there is a lot of work.
[2217.72] Sit, man, you just came. 
Tea, cold drink, we will have food.
[2220.92] I will come again.
I will come again.
[2222.96] Okay? Okay, then.
[2225.84] Take care. See you.
