[38.36] Ramsha I am asking
 what happened here?
[41.32] Afnan, he was talking dirty to me.
[72.76] Hello?
[73.64] What rubbish have 
you said to Ramsha?
[75.40] Oh, so she lit the 
fire between us.
[83.00] Dude, you know these girls
[86.52] they listen from one
 and tell the other one
[89.88] and as far as I know,
[93.08] wives complain their husbands,
[98.72] but Ramsha is not your wife.
[101.40] Shut up,
[102.84] just up.
[105.28] Answer my question.
[108.72] I am joking, dude.
[113.08] I didn’t say anything to her that
[114.60] you should be so mad about,
[116.72] I just said that if
[118.56] she has a problem 
in your house
[120.92] then I can make arrangements 
for her to stay.
[123.40] I know very well what that means,
[129.44] look listen to me carefully,
[132.76] this is not the Ramsha 
you knew from before,
[135.52] she has changed herself a lot 
and I am a witness to it.
[138.52] I have seen it with my own eyes.
[140.40] Oh please forget it, brother,
[142.56] I think that she is just
 trying to impress you.
[152.64] All this is a show off 
to prove she is pious.
[154.68] Whatever she is doing is 
between herself and her God,
[158.20] you don’t have to talk rubbish,
 understand?
[160.68] Afnan, why are you 
getting so serious?
[163.36] It doesn’t make any difference
 to such girls, my brother.
[167.24] I am telling you for one last time,
[170.44] stay away from Ramsha or else…
[192.88] Who was it?
[193.72] Yes party, yes what?
 What what?
[196.12] No who was she?
[198.32] Dude,
[200.08] it wasn’t someone so important that
[201.88] I should tell you it was.
[204.32] Tell me what needs to 
be done about the party
[205.68] else I won’t talk to Dad.
[207.72] No if you have no interest
[209.88] so there is a possibility for me…
[211.16] Let me work on the details as to 
what needs to be spoken with the party.
[229.08] Traffic,
[230.16] traffic,
[230.56] you know how Karachi’s traffic is,
[232.88] even if a person leaves in time
[234.08] but they get stuck somewhere and
[235.32] get late like me.
[237.88] You don’t trust me?
[239.04] Then ask this Fahad, 
tell Fahad. Fahad will tell,
[242.40] Fahad, Fahad will tell,
[244.68] Fahad is my best friend,
[246.24] and do you know the quality of Fahad?
[248.08] Fahad never lies,
[249.60] he always tells the truth, right Fahad?
[251.36] Fahad, this is Ramsha,
[253.68] it is Ramsha’s birthday today,
[256.08] Happy Birthday Ramsha.
[267.40] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[269.32] Call Madam Ramsha.
[272.40] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[274.60] Greetings.
[276.44] Are you doing well, my child?
[278.40] Wow, uncle you got a new phone?
[291.40] Uncle, this is the latest version.
[294.92] Amazing, Mom,
[296.52] uncle got a new phone for himself.
[303.52] Hey, no, it is not for me.
[308.60] Greetings uncle.
[309.64] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[312.40] Did you call me?
[313.64] Ramsha, my child, this is for you.
[327.00] But I have a small phone, uncle.
[332.24] My child, everyone has such phone,
[335.00] you must keep one too, 
you will like it.
[351.48] Thank you,
[352.80] but I cannot take this phone,
[354.84] I don’t need it, uncle.
[358.24] My child, if not for yourself,
[360.56] keep it for my sake.
[362.56] Just consider that your 
uncle got it for you, hmm?
[377.00] Thank you, Thank you.
[379.04] Stay blessed.
[381.76] Get me a good cup of tea then,
[383.64] yeah?
[420.20] Isn’t uncle being a little too 
affectionate on Ramsha?
[426.44] I mean, if he had to give 
her a new phone,
[429.16] he could have given 
her any phone,
[431.32] what was the need for him to give
 her such an expensive phone?
[433.40] That is what I was thinking too.
[441.44] Brother never showed 
you so much love
[444.76] and who does so much 
with strangers anyway?
[448.52] Forget about uncle,
[449.96] Afnan is behaving similarly too.
[459.12] He gives Ramsha’s example on 
everything and praises her.
[462.12] If she took a little care of uncle
 then what is the big deal?
[472.48] But who should tell them this?
[474.52] That is why I tell you to leave your job
[476.68] and focus on your home.
[486.60] Just look at Ramsha,
 she is such a clever girl,
[489.32] she is always 
revolving around brother,
[491.64] she takes care of him,
[492.60] gives him medicines
[494.28] and now she cooks all 
his diet food herself.
[499.04] So what do you want, Mom?
[501.04] I should put my career 
at stake for all this?
[512.20] Alizeh, it is very difficult 
to explain it to you,
[515.00] tell me something
[520.08] when a girl gets married,
[521.76] her career gets connected
 to her husband,
[531.88] and by the grace of God, 
Afnan has everything
[537.60] and whatever belongs to 
him will belong to you
[546.04] so then why are you giving so 
much importance to your career?
[550.36] Mom, let’s think for a minute,
[553.80] if we minus Afnan from my life,
[556.96] so then?
[562.76] What will I be left with?
[564.48] There won’t be Afnan or all of this.
[566.52] Stop talking nonsensical things.
[568.32] God forbid, anything happens to Afnan.
[570.64] You must think before speaking, Alizeh.
[572.28] Mom, please,
[574.72] why don’t you understand?
[576.52] I don’t want to be 
dependent on anyone.
[579.16] May God show you the right path.
[580.92] You say whatever you feel like.
[606.44] Sorry, really sorry,
dude, really sorry,
[608.44] you had to come again 
because of me.
[611.00] That’s not a problem,
 it is a part of our job.
[614.52] I will leave now, dad is waiting.
[616.36] Yes, sure, sure, sure,
[617.80] take care.
[640.52] Greetings.
[641.48] If you would have gotten 
5 more minutes late,
[643.52] I would have taken 
the car from here
[645.40] and then I don’t care if you 
had to come back in a taxi,
[648.08] what the hell.
[649.56] I even refused uncle.
[651.72] Yes, you always refuse uncle,
[654.40] we are the ones who are crazy
[655.48] no matter where we go, 
we have to take you for sure.
[658.40] Let’s go, driver.
[673.16] Come out, come.
[675.00] Madam, you guys sit, I will check.
[679.32] Oh.
[683.60] Are you blind?
[684.36] Can’t you see?
[685.80] Can’t you see the bike?
[689.24] what the hell?
[693.48] Sorry, brother, even you were
 coming from the wrong side.
[695.76] So, your sorry will fulfill my damages?
[698.16] Yeah? Who will pay for my damages?
[700.80] Your bike is absolutely fine.
[703.20] It seems fine
[704.92] and what about the 
internal injuries I got?
[707.20] I will go to the hospital only
[708.32] then I will find out how 
many wounds I have gotten.
[710.28] And this bike,
[712.04] you have broken its engine.
[723.12] You think I am a fool?
[725.24] Even I can see
[726.76] if the engine has malfunctioned 
or your brain.
[728.36] Look, listen to me,
[730.04] just quietly pay for 
my damages here.
[733.48] Pay me Rs10,000 quietly
[735.20] else let’s go to the police station.
[741.16] You will be in trouble.
[753.84] Just give him some money.
[756.24] Come on, son, take out the money.
[764.52] Give that too.
[765.36] Your work will be done in this.
[766.40] Give me the money.
[767.36] No brother,
[767.96] your work will be done
 with this much money,
[769.00] why are you bothering me?
[771.04] Go away.
[771.68] You are one to talk.
[773.60] Move your bike.
[859.16] listen to me,
[860.60] just quietly pay for my damages here.
[862.40] Pay me Rs10,000 quietly
[864.12] else let’s go to the police station.
[865.12] You will be in trouble.
[913.92] Whose number is that?
[916.44] Hello?
[918.64] Annie?
[921.56] Ramsha?
[923.08] Yes, how are you?
[925.68] How are you, Ramsha?
[926.72] Where are you?
[927.64] Where is aunt?
[929.12] Where are you guys?
[930.12] We all miss you so much.
[932.68] Annie,
[934.32] you just tell me,
[935.96] does anyone at home
 know where I am?
[938.00] I wouldn’t be asking you if I knew.
[946.24] Do you know brother and dad
 tried so much to find you
[949.28] but there was no clue of you guys.
[952.08] I cannot believe I am talking to you today.
[956.40] Uncle and Shani both are looking for me?
[962.16] It means they don’t know where am I?
[964.28] yes, Ramsha.
[965.68] No one knows anything about you here.
[968.60] Are you well, Ramsha?
[970.84] Yes Annie, I am absolutely fine and
[972.88] I am completely safe where I am.
[979.88] You take care of yourself and aunt,
[982.44] remember me in your prayers please.
[984.52] But where are you?
[986.08] Okay bye.
[987.84] Hello?
[989.28] Ramsha?
[991.08] Hello, Ramsha?

whole video again.

[1015.52] See, mom called.
[1017.80] Where are you Annie?
[1019.52] No, no, no,
[1020.08] Annie, we will complete this video
[1021.56] and then you can leave, okay?
[1022.56] Mom is calling me.
[1023.52] Annie?
[1023.96] No Ramsha, 
mom will scold me a lot,
[1025.36] please leave my hand.
[1026.32] Get lost from here.
[1031.12] take this.
[1032.60] You took so long, Annie.
[1034.56] Hey,
[1035.84] there was so much rush in the 
canteen, I was so angry,
[1038.52] you don’t do anything yourself,
[1039.84] you make me do all the work 
at home and here as well
[1042.60] You slacker.
[1050.28] did you hear?
[1051.72] It is mom’s voice, right?
[1053.40] your ears are ringing,
[1055.12] don’t you know your mom?
[1056.76] When she goes to the market,
[1057.68] she comes back hours later.
[1059.68] If she sees me making TikToks,
[1062.36] I will be in trouble.
[1063.36] She doesn’t like making 
these TikToks at all.
[1067.16] Actually, mom doesn’t like 
me making TikToks at all.
[1070.96] Do you want to waste
 all the time talking
[1072.64] or shall we make the video?
[1074.20] Make the video properly,
[1075.28] I am telling you Annie,
[1076.20] if you ruin my video.
[1078.12] Stand here, come from there,
[1079.40] you will enter the frame at 3 2 1,
[1081.08] come on, ready?
[1083.08] 3 2 1.
[1096.56] What we want in life never happens
[1098.60] But what I think, that exactly happens
[1100.96] Okay then end of story,
[1102.60] no word will ever affect you,
[1104.60] so then why should we talk?
[1105.92] So then don’t talk,
[1107.04] you should stay quiet,
[1107.80] don’t try to be my mom everywhere.
[1128.16] Look Miss Annie,
[1129.08] the things is that you will get into
 trouble by mom whenever,
[1134.44] but the trouble that you are 
about to get in by me,
[1137.64] I won’t leave you.
[1138.84] How did you take Afnan’s name?
[1140.92] Now you see, my child.
[1141.88] You pulled my braid, again?
[1143.48] She doesn’t let me study
[1144.52] Okay, okay okay sorry. Ramsha,
 I won’t leave you.
[1146.60] Dad, dad, dad.
[1147.80] What is going on?
[1149.00] Dad, she is hitting me
 so much for no reason.
[1150.76] She is lying, she pulled my braid.
[1153.64] What happened my child,
[1154.48] what is this childish behavior?
[1155.48] Why do you bother her?
[1156.72] I bother her?
[1158.12] You have no idea how 
much she bothers me,
[1160.40] she looks very innocent but
[1162.08] she is a wild cat from within.
[1164.00] Wild cat? I will tell you now.
[1165.72] no.
[1166.16] I won’t spare you,
[1167.36] I will tell you the meaning of wild cat.
[1179.80] What does success means?
[1181.96] Success is when you have 
achieved something in life,
[1186.32] where it’s good for you both 
in this life and hereafter.
[1193.84] How is it good for you in 
this world or hereafter,
[1198.16] I don’t know when will we 
understand the meaning of success.
[1201.60] That is what is called 
success these days
[1205.12] that some people should
 recognize you,
[1207.68] you should have money and fame,
[1210.80] a house, a car and a good job,
[1214.80] all this is called success,
[1216.92] do you understand
[1220.72] And honor?
[1231.28] Why doesn’t girls like you
 think before eloping that
[1234.92] because of their actions
[1238.08] their sisters will have to
 pay for the damage
[1240.40] or the girls of their house?
[1247.44] What happened Ramsha?
[1250.04] Why are you avoiding eye contact?
[1255.52] You eloped from the house
[1258.28] but I paid for your sin.
[1264.08] I got restricted from doing everything,
[1267.48] from coming and going to places,
[1270.16] to talk on phone,
[1273.80] even on combined studies.
[1285.76] Please Annie,
[1286.96] just help me once,
[1288.64] just make me meet him for once.
[1292.04] Just think
[1293.08] you won’t get such 
a brother-in-law anywhere
[1295.40] and I will help you get whatever 
money you demand
[1297.96] from him while hiding his shoes,
 for sure.
[1300.24] Are you sure?
[1301.52] Yes, I am sure.
[1304.20] You won’t change.
[1306.52] Thank you so much,
[1309.12] you are my best sister.
[1325.84] Are you happy?
[1334.56] You are lying,
[1336.56] Ramsha doesn’t get 
happy like this,
[1339.36] when Ramsha gets happy,
[1340.48] she screams, gets chirpy, 
blooms, make noise,
[1343.32] and most of all eats my brain,
[1346.08] you did none of it.
[1349.60] I told you that
[1352.60] one has to change
 their selves with time.
[1357.00] No Ramsha,
[1359.20] you don’t change yourself,
[1360.96] I like you the way you are,
[1362.68] laughing smiling, 
always making noise,
[1367.48] I like Ramsha that way.
[1373.32] Annnie, I am helpless,
[1377.80] I cannot tell you anything,
[1381.68] I heard your voice after so long,
[1386.64] even I wanted to talk a lot to you
[1391.12] Annie I wanted to tell you that
[1394.56] my mother is no longer
 in this world
[1398.96] and how I have got 
so lonely after my mom,
[1402.04] I wanted to tell you all of this, 
Annie,
[1406.52] exactly the way we used to 
sit before and talk for hours,
[1415.40] it was such a good time,
[1419.24] everything is over.
[1422.60] Everything is over.
[1425.00] I wish,
[1427.52] I wish that time can come back again,
[1431.36] I wish.
[1467.20] Where is Alizeh?
[1468.56] Madam Alizeh has gone to the office.
[1471.00] And Afnan?
[1472.48] Sir Afnan is in his room.
[1474.76] Okay fine, you may go.
[1534.52] You have beautiful hair.
[1537.44] You?
[1542.36] How dare you come in my room?
[1546.52] Why do you keep on getting angry 
at me over everything?
[1550.44] I want to be friends with you and
[1552.48] you are just mad and mad..
[1555.60] You are such a shameless person,
[1557.40] looks like one slap
 wasn’t enough for you
[1559.12] so you have come to my room
 to get another slap?
[1561.72] You want to slap me again?
[1564.24] Here,
[1565.60] slap me,
[1567.16] but his time make 
sure it’s a tight slap,
[1569.84] I want to have the feeling 
of it for a few days.
[1575.88] Go away from here,
[1578.32] I said leave my room.
[1581.08] Don’t you understand?
[1582.28] Go away from here.
[1583.68] Why?
[1584.76] Did your plans change?
[1586.68] You don’t want to slap me now?
[1588.40] Leave my hands.
[1589.08] Let me make it easy for you.
[1590.24] Leave my hands.
[1591.00] Let me slap myself.
[1591.92] Leave my hand.
[1615.00] Look what happened to her?
[1616.16] She slipped.
[1617.40] You are always lost.
[1618.60] Madam Ramsha?
[1620.04] Madam Ramsha? 
You are bleeding.
[1622.40] Let me call Mr. Afnan.
[1638.84] Mr. Afnan, Mr. Afnan,
[1640.80] madam Ramsha, she…
[1643.16] what happened, Tabassum,
[1643.80] why are you panicking?
[1644.92] What happened to Ramsha?
[1646.08] Madam Ramsha’s head is bleeding,
[1647.96] she got hurt on the head.
[1649.08] What? Where is she?
[1651.24] She is upstairs in her room.
[1688.76] How did you get hurt?
[1703.92] I am asking you how
 did you get hurt?
[1718.96] What were you doing that 
you got hurt so bad?
[1729.96] Tell me, answer me?
[1732.28] What was going on that you 
got such a huge wound?
[1736.72] Sir Jr, your friend Mr. Fahad came 
in madam Ramsha’s room.
[1770.68] Afnan, actually,
[1772.04] Afnan, at least listen to me.
[1774.48] Why did you tell?
[1782.64] I don’t know what drama 
will be created now.
[1784.60] Oh God.
[1801.32] Yes, where are you?
[1804.12] Okay I am coming.
[1869.20] I told you.
[1871.04] How dare you?
[1872.72] What happened Afnan?
[1873.16] When I asked you stay 
away from that girl
[1875.20] then how dare you?
[1876.32] You did such a disgusting
 thing with her that
[1878.72] I can’t believe it.
[1881.88] What are you doing?
[1882.72] Leave me, people are watching.
[1883.80] everyone’s watching?
[1885.08] Everyone should know 
that this person,
[1887.44] this person is a harasser,
[1890.04] he has taken advantage of 
a helpless and a girl without a family,
[1893.48] he harassed her.
[1894.72] I am ashamed to call 
you my friend today,
[1897.12] a disgusting man like you 
shouldn’t be part of this society.
[1901.68] Leave me, dude.
[1904.68] Is she your lover that
[1905.92] you are humiliating your 
friend because of her?
[1908.16] You are disgusting
[1909.76] who is having fun with an 
outsider despite having a wife at home.
[1930.64] Not everyone person is 
characterless like you are,
[1939.44] neither I have anything
 in my heart like that
[1944.08] nor she is characterless.
[1947.48] And I will kill you if I ever see
 you even near Ramsha next time,
[1956.88] do you understand?
[1965.64] Hey, what did he say?
[1968.52] Leave me.
[1969.28] what happened?
[1969.96] You come here to eat for free, 
you should have interfered.
[1999.16] What happened Afnan,
[2000.12] why did you get so late today?
[2001.68] Nothing, I had an accident.
[2003.32] Accident? Are you okay?
[2005.68] Nothing happened,
 I am telling you that I had an accident.
[2008.12] Hey?
[2026.48] Mr. Afnan, this is the 
bill for this month,
[2029.32] Mr. Qasim got some extra things
 added in the grocery
[2033.36] so they have been 
added to it as well.
[2040.12] And dad was asking
[2042.12] this needs to be carried 
for next two months
[2044.52] or is this enough?
[2046.00] no, no, we need to continue it.
[2048.36] You add the same 
grocery for next month rest
[2050.64] I will ask dad and let you know.
[2053.56] Okay fine.
[2056.00] okay listen, what is your name?
[2058.20] Shani, Shani.
[2059.40] Shani,
[2061.12] one or two areas have
 been marked by my manager,
[2063.40] they are the areas of 
deserving people,
[2066.20] I need to get confirmation
 from him once,
[2068.60] then I will let you know you will
 have to add the grocery of that place too then.
[2071.92] That will be done,
[2072.96] don’t worry about that,
[2074.24] as much as you 
want that will be added.
[2076.20] In fact,
[2078.36] dad was saying that
[2079.60] we will also give you 20% discount
[2082.96] No, this is charity work,
[2084.76] what discount in it?
[2088.40] You just try that
[2090.60] the quality of your 
groceries is good.
[2093.28] Yes, don’t worry about that
[2094.80] I am checking that myself
[2096.28] and if you want, I can show
 you everything as well.
[2099.32] No, no that is not needed,
[2101.44] you just continue with grocery.
[2104.00] Okay.
[2104.80] Umm excuse me, 
I am getting a very important call.
[2107.60] Okay yes, I will leave too. 
Thank you.
[2109.64] Thank you so much, take care.
[2112.28] Hello?
[2113.72] Yes, yes,

[2117.72] and what is the time in New York?
