Just given medicine to sister-in-law
and made her lie down, she must rest for a while. Its good, she will rest for a while, Mehnaz’s BP already gets very high. Yes. That… Papa. Papa. Uncle, where is papa… Shameless girl, because of you… because of my father like brother 
left me and went. Because of you. 
You are a murderer. You are the murderer of your father. I should not see you here. 
Take her from here. Take her. Anwar, one minute. Be quiet. This is not the time to talk 
about these things. I said, I will not see her here. 
Get lost. Take her away. Child, go inside. 
Ramsha, child, go inside. Come on. Come on. 
Come inside. Disobedient child. She is the murderer. Stop it. She is my brother’s murderer. 
I will not forgive this girl all my life. Dad, what was the need for you 
to come here from the airport. You should have at least told me, I would have picked you, 
or sent the driver. Great. I am not as old as you people 
consider me. How hard is it to come home
from the airport? But brother, you always do this, you don’t bother others with 
your existence. Give us a chance to serve you once. Afnan is absolutely right. Okay, I will be careful in future 
on your insistence. Okay? Should I serve food for you? I am not hungry. You have come after so many days, 
we will eat together. I will get it served. Greeting. How are you Mr. Anwar? When? May God give you all patience, this is the reality. Mr. Anwar, when is the funeral? Fine, I will surely come. Do let me know if I can be of any help. I will come. What happened dad? 
Who passed away? Hey, that Mr. Sajid from the store, for whose daughter’s wedding 
I gave you money. Yes. He had a heart attack, 
he passed away. We have to go to the funeral, 
we will go. Okay? Dad, you just came. 
You must be tired. Hey no man, what is wrong? All of us have to go one day. This funeral is a reminder. May God forgive him. He was a good, decent man. Ramsha. Yes, papa, I am coming. Here you go, your light. You brought it. You are so good. 
Thank you. Hey, my daughter makes a wish 
and I don’t fulfill it? How is it possible? Thank you papa. What was the need to bring this?
You fulfill all her wishes. This unconditional love of 
yours has spoiled her. I have one daughter, wife of mine, if I don’t care for her wishes, 
then will we care about the neighbours? Mehnaz, this is the same Ramsha right? She grew up so quickly. I remember the day when 
the nurse gave a doll in my arms, that sir, you had a daughter. I thanked God, that thank you God, 
you sent blessings to our home. Papa, you are really good. Thank you so much. Thank you, papa. 
Thank you. I am not from amongst 
those father’s child, who put their daughters on the line 
to save their relations. One happiness of yours is greater than 
everything in the world for me. Sister in law, why will we keep this girl here? She is not a girl! She is my daughter! My daughter. She agreed that her father gets insulted
 in front of the world. Fine. But I don’t accept that my daughter 
is dragged out of my home. I really don’t find peace. If you don’t forgive me, I will die. Forgive me. Forgive me, papa, I will do anything after this. Forgive me with your heart, please. Please, papa. You are stubborn since childhood. After all, you are my daughter. I forgive you with my heart, child. That’s it, I have had enough. My daughter didn’t commit such a big sin, that you are punishing her like this. If this is what decent people do that they bring their family and insult 
the sisters and daughters of people, then we are really not that decent. Before I drag you out, leave from here. Leave! I don’t have the courage 
to face people, Anwar. My back is broken, I feel as though, there is no strength in my legs. My steps wont support me. My respect is ruined. I wish I too had died along with this respect, it would have been so good. Ramsha. They have brought elder papa. Come on. Brother Anwar, we are really sorry. I couldn’t believe it. I had met brother Sajid a week back. Even we don’t believe it that my brother, the head of our family, would leave us and go suddenly. The heart attack was an excuse. His daughter’s wedding got canceled, how could a respectable father 
tolerate all this. What? The wedding got canceled? But why? Was it a matter of dowry? Hey, nothing like that. Actually, his daughter ran away 
from the home. What do I say about the one 
who passed away? May God forgive him. If the children are disobedient, 
then the parents have to tolerate a lot. Brother Sajid couldn’t tolerate it, 
he was weak. Sister in law. Sister in law. Sister in law. Sister in law, get a grip on yourself, 
open your eyes. Sister in law, look at him 
for the last time. After that you wont be able 
to see him, they will take him. Sister in law. Sister in law. Get a grip on yourself. Ramsha, I had told you not to come here. Leave. Go to your room. Go. Take her away. Let her see elder papa’s face once, papa. Not at all. This will not happen with me alive. A disobedient child doesn’t have a right that they see the face of a dead father. 
Take her inside. Take her! No. No, no, uncle. Don’t torment me like this. Let me see my father’s face. All of you know how much 
papa loved me. When everyone rejected me, my father had hugged me. No one can stop me from seeing 
my father’s face. A sin…
Stop it. People are seeing. She is committing a sin and 
then she is arguing. Stop it. 
She has killed my brother. Don’t get angry. 
She is a sinner. Papa, please. You want to hit me, right?
No. You can hit me. 
Hit me. But I will surely see my father’s face, and no one can take away 
the right for it. It is enough. Go back from here. Papa. Papa, please get up. After today, I will not do anything wrong. See, I am Ramsha, your daughter. I am with you. 
I am calling you. Mama. Mama, make papa get up. You tell him once that 
Ramsha is calling him, he would listen to everything I would say. Tell him to get up. Mama, 
why are you not listening to me? Hear me. Aunt. Aunt. Aunt, please. Please, make my father get up. He loves me a lot. 
How can he leave me and go? Ramsha, child. 
He knows I will be alone. How will I do it all? 
Papa. Papa. See. Papa, look at me. Get up, Ramsha is calling you. 
Why don’t listen to me? Papa! Ramsha. Sister in law. Ramsha. Ramsha. 
Ramsha. Sister in law. 
Get water quickly. Sister in law. Sister in law. Ramsha. Mr. Qasim, my brother, my beloved brother was 
in place of my father. When my father passed away, I didn’t feel that I have become an orphan. Because my brother was with me. But believe me, today, I am sure, that I have become an orphan. Have patience. That’s what God wanted. Every soul has to taste death. Just think that Sajid came 
with these breaths. I am really sorry to hear about your brother. May God forgive him. Amen. Amen. If a person is patient in difficult times, then God especially blesses him for that. I know, I can understand the sorrow 
you feel when someone your own leaves, but believe me, the bigger the test is, God will bless you for it equally. You are right. I am trying my best, but I am unable to find peace. The Prophet (P.B.U.H.) has said 
that God is with the patient ones. You pray for your brother’s forgiveness, May God make this journey easy for Sajid, may He give him a place in heaven. Amen. What time is the funeral prayer? After the asar prayers. May God help us complete 
our responsibility and the sooner this responsibility 
is fulfilled, the better. God will be kind. 
God will make it easy. Make them sit. Send a black coffee for me, please.
Thank you. Afnan. Yes, Afnan, go ahead. All okay? No Alizay, nothing is fine. Why? What happened? Are you fine? What do I tell you? I am not fine. I really miss you, Alizay. Oh God, Afnan, you had scared me. See, this means you always worry for me too. But if I say it like this that I am always 
in your heart and mind, that would be better. No, there is nothing like that. That’s how it is. How do you know? How can you be so sure? I have your heart. I know the importance of it well and no one knows the condition 
is better than me. Okay. I feel you have no work today, you are totally free. No, I am really busy. I just missed you so I called. Hmmm. Okay, Afnan, put the phone down now, 
I am going to the office, I am getting late. I will call you when I get there. Are you sure? You will call, right? 
You wont forget, right? Why will I forget? I will call you. Fine, I am disconnecting the call 
on the condition that now you will call me. Mama. I have kept your medication, 
please take it. Leave from here. Mama, do you too feel like everyone that 
I am responsible for papa’s death? Speak up, mama. Answer me. Look here, and tell me, 
that do you really feel that I am responsible for papa’s death? Speak up, why are you not answering? Yes! You are responsible for 
my husband’s death. You have killed my husband. Because of you my husband’s 
heart stopped. Because whatever you did was
 enough to stop his heart. Now go from here. 
Leave from here. Go. Go from here, come on. 
Leave from here. Hey, why are you standing here like
 a stubborn person in front of me. Why don’t you get lost? What do you want?
What do you want? Your mother too should die 
like your father. That’s what you want, right? 
Kill me. Why don’t you kill me?
No. No. God forbid. God forbid, something happens to you. I pray that I get killed in your place. God forbid, I lose you. You feel I did all this. 
All this is my responsibility. You kill me, you choke me with
 your hands, so that I die. I want to die. 
Mama, I cannot tolerate it. Okay enough. Okay be quiet. Every one is taunting me, 
they are insulting me, they are cursing me. Mama, what do you people think? The groom’s family went back, I made a scene out of in front of everyone. I have been insulted in front of everyone. 
Do I not have pain? Okay….
Do I not suffer? I am really sad. My papa leave me and went, mama. I am in a lot of pain. 
I feel my heart will stop beating. I cannot tolerate what everyone is saying. That’s it, stop. Your mother is still alive. No one will say anything to you. 
No one will say anything. Annie, come quickly. Yes, mama? Take this food to sister in law’s room. She is in mourning,
 she cannot come here. And listen, call Ramsha upstairs too 
we will all sit and eat together. No need to call that girl upstairs. Just send her food to her room. Anwar, what is wrong with you? Brother Sajid hasn’t been gone for long. Ramsha is really sad, I saw her crying often. So she is crying because of her actions. Had she not done all this, then today we wouldn’t have had 
to see this day. Anyway, what is the point of taunting her like this?
 She made a mistake, and brother Sajid forgave her, 
sister in law has forgiven her. Who are we to taunt her like this? Yes, so forgiving her was
 their helplessness. After all, she is their only daughter,
and they did this for her. But did you see the result of it? Elder papa had his first heart 
and he passed away. This is what she has done to them. Mr. Shani, even your mother wants that we forgive Ramsha and 
take her tension on our heads. And we meet a similar end hearing 
the taunts of people. We have the first heart attack 
and we die. Hey, fear God. What are you saying? I didn’t mean that at all. You have taken the discussion 
in such a wrong direction. Have food at least.
 Come on. I will not forgive that girl, that’s it. Ramsha. 
Yes? What are you doing so early 
in the morning? I am making chicken rice. Mama had told me to make chicken rice
and distribute it amongst the poor. Fine. In fact, Annie, you do one thing, you go and tell Shani to distribute 
this rice in our neighbourhood. Our neighbours are not that rich. Everyone has six to seven children 
in their home. It is good everyone will get food. We will get blessed. What happened? 
What are you thinking? I am thinking that the neighbours 
who talk so much against you, you are thinking so much for them. Look Annie, the more the mouths, the more people talk. Who all will we shut up? After all, if someone is talking let them, them talking wont make us bad. It feels like elder papa is talking. Really? Do you feel that way? Yes, the tone in which you are talking, 
it feels that elder papa is talking. Just like him. Man, elder papa was really good. Along with you, he would really
take care of me too. The home is really lonely after him. You are absolutely right. Papa was really very good. The home is really lonely after he left. The home doesn’t look like home. Anyway, will you chop the onions, 
please? Yes, I will. The food will be ready quickly. Anwar. 
Yes? Ramsha was saying that sister in law’s medication has run out,
she needs money. Really? Tell her to give me the prescription, 
I will get it on my way back. Fine, I will ask her, but… But, what? Sister in law has asked one or two times
about the earnings of the shop indirectly. Did sister in law say this to you herself? No, but I understood what she meant. Okay, then also understand what I am saying. Keep your understanding to yourself and don’t talk any useless thing. If something like this happens, 
then I am here. I will talk to sister in law again. And after today, 
don’t say anything like this. What do you understand?
Anwar, what did I say? I told you what she said. What you say, I will tell her. I didn’t say anything on my own. For no reason. 
What did you say? Before going give me money for meat. I have to cook food. Your son is unable to eat vegetables, 
he only eats meat, and I don’t have money for meat. Yes, the meat will come. You or your son shouldn’t worry. Thank you. Shani, this seems like medication 
for a few days. Papa, asked me to get medication 
for two days, so I got it for two days. Yes, but I didn’t ask uncle for two days. I told him I want medication for a week. I am telling you, what papa told me I did. I got it for two days. Fine, I will talk to him myself. 
Hello. Where are you going? I am going to talk to uncle.
I will tell him, I don’t need medication for two days, 
I want them for a week. Papa is at the shop. Talk to him when he comes in the evening. Fine, take out your phone, ask uncle, when you have to get 
the remaining medication. Call him. I don’t have balance to waste. If you want, you can call 
from your own phone. So… Aunt, I was coming to you. all okay, child?
Is everything fine? What happened? 
Why are you worried? I had asked Shani to get medication
for mama for a week, he got it for two days only. I am even calling uncle, 
he is not answering. Okay, I will call your uncle. If I talk to him, then I will ask him. Fine, thank you. But aunt, the doctor has strictly said that mama 
needs to take her medication on time. Even if a day’s dose is missed, 
mama can get unwell. You please talk to him and 
get the medication. Child, do one thing, give the prescription
 for the medication. I will tell Shani, he will get you 
more medication. Aunt, we need this medication for a 
week and this for five days. Okay fine. I am going to mama with the medication. Greetings, papa. Greetings, how are you? Give it to me, should I take it?
No, it is fine. Where is Shani? He is not at home. I had asked him to come and pick me,
but he didn’t come. I don’t know. You call him and ask. What is the point of calling him?
His phone is always engaged. He keeps his phone busy like 
he is running factories. Papa, you must be tired, 
get fresh, I will serve food. Where is your mother? She went to aunt Shahida’s home. Why? She had a grandson. Your mother cannot stay at home. At times someone’s funeral and then at times someone has had a child. Call her and tell her to come back home,
I have come back. In fact, do one thing, let me talk 
to her on the phone. Sure. Greetings. mama, I am going to university. I will continue my studies, it was papa’s dream that I complete my graduation and 
achieve something in life. That’s why I will go to university 
from today and study. Go child. May God give you success. 
Go come on. Thank you, mama. 
Goodbye. I wish you had gotten this smart 
in brother Sajid’s life. That poor thing left the world asking you to study and work hard, but you… You never got free from that fashion, 
mobile and videos. Sister in law, you see the environment
of the home and what it has become. I cannot say anything, 
I cannot do anything. Mama, she… Stop it child. Be quiet. Look, I don’t want that we have 
an argument early in the morning. Your father hasn’t been gone for long. People will talk for no reason. 
You just be quiet.
