[19.80] Afnan, you forgot all your manners
and respect completely?
[23.03] I mean, is this how to treat guests
that come to your home?
[26.97] Child, if you had such emotions
for Alizay in your heart,
[31.60] then you should have spoken to me,
to your aunt.
[37.47] Afnan,
[40.00] you shouldn’t have done all this.
[43.00] For me there can be nothing that
will make me happier than
[47.40] I see you and Alizay together.
[50.40] You should have mentioned it to me.
[54.93] Aunt,
[57.37] I know,
[60.23] whatever I did, my method was wrong,
[65.37] but…
[66.63] but I had nothing wrong in my intentions.
[69.00] What….
[69.97] Okay brother,
[71.33] forgive him.
[72.47] He is a child.
[74.47] I…
[75.07] I guarantee you that he will not
make a mistake in future.
[79.57] You also see that
[81.03] he has said what was in his heart.
[88.43] But Afsheen, you…
[89.67] Okay brother, stop it.
[92.33] You don’t have to scold my child, now.
[97.43] This child is yours.
[99.47] Your love and affection has done this.
[102.63] I mean,
[104.37] what do I say to you aunt
and nephew?
[109.47] That boy Ashar,
[112.33] we will have to go to their home
and apologize to them.
[114.83] What is the needs…
Hey, they are good….
[118.83] they didn’t deserve such treatment.
[122.60] Man….
[127.23] Yes!
[129.17] Aunt, thank you so much,
[130.07] you saved my life today.
[131.67] I thought dad is so angry.
[133.27] For the first time in my life,
I will get beaten today.
[135.67] But aunt you are so sweet,
see how you saved me.
[138.73] Okay tell me something,
[140.07] where is the madam for whom
I did all this?
[143.60] Where would she be?
She is in her room.
[144.77] Where else?
[147.43] Meaning,
[148.47] I will have to go in the lion’s cage myself.
[150.43] Aunt,
[151.87] I will go to her.
[163.37] I don’t understand why you say no
to everything I ask you to do?
[165.77] Because I am not your servant
or wife, that’s why.
[188.33] What are you looking at?
I am right.
[190.67] I am not your wife that
I listen to everything you say.
[195.43] Make me tea!
[198.73] Oh God.
[211.47] I don’t know what he thinks of himself.
[214.40] He will do what he wants.
[217.63] Alizay.
[219.37] Alizay.
[252.43] What happened?
[254.53] Why are you sitting with
such a sad face here?
[259.43] I am thinking how I will go
to the office tomorrow?
[262.83] How will I face Ashar?
[265.73] You know
[267.13] I have a solution for this
like every problem.
[270.17] Huh?
[270.83] You do one thing,
[272.77] resign on email.
[274.73] Yes,
[275.63] neither will you have to go to the office,
[276.97] nor will you have to see Ashar’s face.
[279.97] Who asked you?
[282.53] What solution you have found.
[283.97] I should resign.
[285.47] Hey…
[288.40] I found a good solution.
[290.03] Leave my hand.
[290.93] Hey,
[291.93] you will really benefit from listening to me.
[293.20] I said leave my hand.
[294.77] Hey, I won’t leave your hand.
[296.43] I said, leave my hand.
[301.37] I don’t even want to talk to you.
[303.37] You embarrassed me in front of everyone.
[355.83] Ramsha.
[358.37] Ramsha, child.
[359.43] Child, I have washed the clothes
put them on the clothesline on the roof.
[362.13] There is sun on the roof.
[363.63] Your uncle has to wear them in the evening,
[365.40] they will dry quicker.
[368.80] I just came tired from the university.
[370.53] I don’t have the strength to work at all,
[372.57] and I have no strength to go on the roof.
[376.03] Whenever I ask you to do some work,
you never have strength to do any work.
[384.03] You are a lazy girl. Lazy.
[388.97] Poor Ramsha does all the work.
[391.13] She has so much burden on her shoulders.
[393.03] People don’t get it.
[396.00] Hey…
[397.83] Mama,
[398.73] I will quickly go and hang these
clothes on the roof, okay?
[402.67] I will come in two minutes, mama.
[404.87] Okay, then.
[414.93] Sister in law,
[416.53] I had kept a bucket of washed clothes here,
[418.67] where is it?
[419.63] Hey Ramsha took the clothes
to hang them upstairs.
[424.63] She is a weird girl.
[426.13] When I was asking her, she clearly said no.
[428.40] Now she took her herself.
[430.60] Salma, you know that girl.
[432.97] You never know about her mood,
[434.97] she is in one mood in a moment
and in another in the next.
[464.67] Hello.
[465.80] Hello.
[467.00] Afnan.
[468.17] First tell me where were you?
[470.73] I was…
[471.33] I have been calling and messaging you
for so many days,
[472.97] neither are you calling me back,
nor are you replying to my messages.
[475.67] Do you even care about me or not?
[477.20] Hey listen…
[478.03] But why would you care about me?
[479.17] You are always busy.
[480.80] You don’t care about anyone.
[482.23] I am the mad one who is always after you.
[485.07] Oh God, girl.
[486.37] Breath.
[487.80] No, first you tell me…
[489.73] answer all my questions quickly.
[491.53] Hey, I will answer you when you get quiet.
[495.77] Go ahead.
[497.33] Man, I was busy.
[500.17] Oh,
[501.73] you only have this small answer
for all the things I said,
[504.23] that you were busy?
[506.37] Listen, I am not in the habit of
talking so much in one breath.
[510.03] You know that well.
[511.73] I was busy.
[512.93] You know, I have a lot of burden of work.
[516.47] Yes,
[517.67] I am the only idiot who worries
for you all the time
[520.17] and I call and message you so much.
[522.83] Okay fine, I am sorry.
[524.47] Shall we move on?
[525.40] Come on, tell me,
[526.13] what is going on?
[526.77] What are you doing?
[528.63] Nothing at all.
[530.00] I just came from university.
[531.60] You tell me, what is going on?
[535.57] Listen, Ramsha, I will call you back,
[537.93] I have an important call coming in.
[539.17] Bye. Bye. Bye.
[541.03] Afnan.
[543.73] You don’t have time for me at all.
[566.33] Hey Alizay,
[567.87] why didn’t you go to the office today?
[570.73] When have you left me capable
of going in front of Ashar?
[574.23] You know he has been calling me
since morning.
[576.83] I don’t have the courage to
answer my phone.
[579.20] Now I am really thinking that
I email him my resignation.
[582.33] Perfect.
[583.43] You know, for the first time in your life
you have made a good decision.
[586.23] Good decision.
[588.03] that’s why I thought I don’t have
to go to the office,
[590.20] so I came for shopping.
[591.40] Yes,
[592.17] and along with that you dragged me.
[594.60] You know,
[595.83] I had such an important meeting in the office,
[597.93] that I have left and come from just for you.
[600.17] It is the start of love, why do you cry?
[602.37] Wait and watch what happens next.
[606.87] By the way, why have you come
in such a bad mood?
[609.93] What happened to you?
[610.63] If you didn’t want to come,
then you should have said no.
[613.07] Alizay, you know that
[615.07] I don’t like this shopping.
[617.20] I mean, I just came here for you or else
[620.00] I worry going for shopping.
[623.00] Hey get out of one shop,
you go to the second one,
[624.40] from there to third, and then the fourth
[626.33] and you don’t have to get anything.
[627.23] Really?
[628.03] So coming to shop with me,
 you find it annoying
[630.73] and what about
 when I come to shop with you?
[632.77] I never said no to you.
[636.43] Yes, that is true.
[639.67] You always come along with me.
[642.07] You never ignore what I say.
[644.03] You always take care of me.
[647.33] That is why
[650.17] I have thought that why don’t
I marry you?
[665.07] What is it, man?
[666.47] You are already doing this with me,
what will you do after marriage?
[669.17] I mean, the food is kept here for so long
[672.43] and you are not asking me to eat.
[673.83] You made me shop so much,
you have tired me so much,
[675.83] now tell me what is this?
[677.93] Hey, you eat.
[679.13] You first.
[680.60] You eat.
[681.13] Eat it. It smells really good.
[690.97] Yes, that is fine,
[692.17] but what can I say?
[696.17] Yes.
[697.60] Actually, Salma is really
 embarrassed in front of you.
[701.23] She couldn’t muster 
the courage to talk to you,
[704.27] that is why she told me
 to apologize to you.
[707.83] Okay.
[708.83] Okay fine,
[711.00] you apologize to her on our behalf.
[713.60] I will talk to you later.
[715.77] Goodbye.
[718.77] Who were you talking to?
[720.63] I was talking to the wedding planner.
[724.20] She had shown a proposal for Annie,
[726.73] but Annie has high standards.
[729.20] Now Salma was so embarrassed that
[730.97] she didn’t have the courage on
how to talk and say no,
[733.83] that is why she told me to marry them.
[737.40] So I was apologizing to them.
[740.13] Hmm.
[742.20] Should I serve food for you?
[743.73] No, no, I am not hungry right now.
[746.17] Get me a cup of tea.
[749.00] Yes, yes,
[749.93] Anwar had come early,
I was making tea for him.
[753.20] I will bring it for you too.
[754.47] Do one thing,
[757.40] ask your wedding planner to search
for a proposal for your Ramsha.
[763.57] Hey,
[765.20] you snatched the words from my mouth.
[767.80] I too was thinking,
[769.40] I would mention Ramsha to them.
[772.20] Now see, Annie and Ramsha
are of the same age
[774.43] and if girls get married at
the right age, it is fine.
[778.20] I will talk to her.
[780.80] I will bring tea for you.
[790.37] Oh God.
[792.07] Why are mama and papa
 after my marriage?
[795.77] I was living a good life.
[798.03] Now these people will start looking for proposals,
[799.83] then they will get me married,
and make my good life, hell.
[804.60] I won’t let this happen.
[806.03] I am not getting married.
[807.83] I don’t want to get married.
[809.93] All this happened cause of this Annie.
[813.27] That is why you shouldn’t live in a joint family.
[816.87] Here one sister in law starts searching for
a proposal for her daughter,
[819.17] the other one also decides that
she too finds a proposal for her daughter.
[822.60] Because from next year,
there will be no proposals.
[826.93] What will happen?
[828.63] Damn you Annie, I won’t leave you.
[830.67] You will see.
[835.23] I will have to do something.
[837.17] Who do I talk to?
[838.53] Who do I tell…
[839.53] Afnan.
[843.33] I will talk to Afnan.
[851.17] Answer the phone Afnan.
Answer it.
[856.60] This Afnan never answers
the phone at the right time.
[862.73] What do I do now?
[868.80] Oh.
[873.43] Relax Ramsha,
[875.00] what is wrong?
[878.83] You are worrying for no reason.
[881.13] After all,
[882.53] aunt and uncle have been looking for
a proposal for Ramsha for a few years,
[886.43] she has not been married.
[889.60] Oh God, so this means they will
only talk about my proposal for some years,
[894.80] then there will be talks of marriage.
[909.93] Wow Hania,
[911.00] you have so many followers in forty minutes.
[914.57] Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
[916.57] Okay, I have some work, I will come.
[918.60] Okay.
[919.27] Bye.
[920.23] I will show you…
[922.93] Hello.
[923.83] What happened?
[924.57] Why were you praising Hania so much?
[926.73] Did you not see Hania’s videos?
[929.43] It was her birthday yesterday,
[930.80] it was so much fun, you cannot imagine.
[933.17] Instagram, Facebook,
[934.73] her birthday has is doing well everywhere.
[938.37] Yes, so?
[940.23] What is the big deal in it.
[942.47] Tomorrow is my birthday
and all of you have to come
[945.67] and you people will see,
[946.57] I will have such a celebration
that the world will see.
[949.57] Then my birthday videos
will be viral everywhere.
[952.37] Okay, we will see.
[953.43] We will also see your birthday tomorrow.
[955.53] Do see it.
[957.73] Bye.
[959.43] Your birthday is on 20th July, right?
[962.03] No,
[963.43] my birthday is tomorrow
and you stay quiet,
[965.77] lower your voice, if someone finds out
then my lie will be caught.
[968.37] And you don’t know all this,
[969.37] so you be quiet and let me manage.
[971.00] Come on.
[994.97] Hello.
[996.63] Hmm.
[998.23] Why did you not go to the office?
[1001.07] when have you left me capable
of going to the office?
[1004.07] I will have to find another job.
[1006.47] Right now I am writing my resignation.
[1008.07] You are doing a good thing.
[1009.60] You know, you shouldn’t have
gone to such a job.
[1011.43] By the way, what is the need for you to do a job?
[1013.80] I mean, do you do it for money?
[1015.37] Do you need it?
[1016.57] What do you mean,
I have no need to do a job.
[1019.87] This is my passion, I like working.
[1022.37] Whatever.
[1023.67] Where is dad?
[1026.57] Some people have come from
the mosque, he is sitting with them.
[1030.43] Man, I don’t know what happens to dad,
[1033.03] he doesn’t listen to me.
[1036.53] Whenever I explain something to him,
he doesn’t agree to me.
[1039.87] Now what was the need to be attached
to committee of the mosque.
[1043.57] There was already so much responsibility
and then on top of that this too.
[1047.23] He is wasting his time for no reason.
[1049.23] Time is not getting wasted.
[1051.60] It is being saved.
[1053.63] This time, this small service,
be of help in that world.
[1057.57] May God accept it.
[1059.43] Okay tell me, did you get the cheque
 deposited in Imam sahib’s account?
[1062.77] Yes, yes, dad, absolutely.
[1064.03] I had asked the manager and he deposited it.
[1068.63] But dad, that…
[1071.97] I just wanted to ask that
[1075.07] his expenses are met with the mosque welfare fund,
[1079.40] then
[1080.53] I don’t understand giving Imam sahib
his salary from your personal account.
[1085.60] Not a lot of money is gathered in
the mosque’s fund, child.
[1091.37] People spend millions on their homes,
[1095.73] but, even giving thousands to
the mosque seem a lot.
[1101.57] The imam sahib doesn’t have a high salary,
[1104.53] I have an idea.
[1105.93] I know.
[1107.87] That is why I give some money
from my account,
[1112.37] it is just that.
[1113.47] Okay?
[1113.87] Yes, dad.
[1119.03] Could you not have told me
that dad is coming?
[1121.13] Hey, how would I know
I was writing my resignation.
[1123.93] You are just taking revenge for this.
[1127.17] Serves you right.
[1135.17] Hey, you don’t drive me mad,
[1138.07] and oh God, why is this water not boiling,
[1140.23] I have to boil the rice.
[1141.83] What has happened to the gas?
[1142.57] Now you go from here, for God’s sake,
[1144.53] I have to send food to your father.
Shani must be on this way.
[1147.47] Mama, this is the limit,
[1148.93] you are worried about the food and gas?
[1151.00] I have to celebrate my birthday
and I need money for that.
[1156.03] Tell me something
[1157.73] have we never celebrated your birthday?
[1160.33] We have, right?
[1161.27] Hey, your father brings cake.
[1164.60] And tell me that there are
several months to your birthday,
[1168.63] why do you already need money?
[1170.93] You are right,
[1172.23] the birthday celebrates for me is grand.
[1175.63] The small cakes he brings,
then you make small pieces of it,
[1178.47] and distribute it in the entire family
like poor and oppressed people,
[1181.93] is not called a celebration.
[1184.63] I will show you how to celebrate a birthday,
[1186.37] and I will celebrate it in such a way
that it will go viral on Tik Tok.
[1190.27] Listen to me,
[1191.60] I don’t have money to waste for
this stupid Tik Tok of yours.
[1194.83] You won’t get money.
[1197.07] And yes,
[1197.93] leave, go and give me the yogurt
from the fridge as you leave.
[1201.00] Go.
[1201.57] Mama, now you are talking about the yogurt.
[1204.03] I am telling you I have to celebrate my birthday,
[1206.40] you are talking about yogurt,
some times gas, then something else.
[1208.13] You give me money right now,
so that I leave from here.
[1211.80] I told you, you won’t get money,
[1214.87] so you won’t get money, that’s it.
[1216.83] Mama, give me the money,
what is wrong?
[1220.07] Don’t you dare ask your father for money.
[1223.20] Hey, he works so hard and that’s
when he earns money
[1226.33] and this money of his is not
for your useless work.
[1230.53] it is not useless, it is my birthday.
[1233.73] Hey, bring me the yogurt!
[1236.13] I am not bringing yogurt.
[1239.80] Oh God.
[1296.23] Aunt.
[1300.37] What are you doing here?
[1302.93] Mama had sent me for some work.
[1305.37] What happened? What do you want?
[1307.00] By the way, what are you doing here?
[1308.27] Go and get ready, you have to
go out with me somewhere.
[1311.33] Where are we going?
[1312.97] Annie, you are asking too many questions.
[1314.80] You will find out where we have to go
when we get there.
[1317.20] Right now you go and get ready,
and come to my room.
[1319.33] I have to go to mama.
[1320.97] Fine.
Go.
[1323.43] Dress up well, okay?
[1349.23] Ramsha, will you tell me
why we have come here?
[1351.63] Walk quietly, you will find out just now.
[1353.93] But tell me, if you have brought me,
then why did you bring me?
[1366.73] This is the same chain that elder papa
gave you on your birthday last year?
[1371.03] Yes
[1373.60] Ramsha, what are you going to do?
Why did you bring it here?
[1376.93] I brought it to sell it, why else
would I have brought it?
[1380.63] Are you out of your mind?
[1381.57] You will sell this? If elder papa finds out, then?
[1385.47] Who will tell him?
[1386.53] Huh?
[1387.13] If you keep your mouth shut,
no one will tell him.
[1390.07] And after all, this is mine,
[1391.53] I am the owner of it. It is up to me,
[1393.37] if I sell it, keep it or lose it.
[1395.87] And Annie, I am not doing anything wrong.
[1397.77] Sit quietly over here, no one should have doubts.
[1402.77] Is this your chain?
[1404.03] Yes.
[1405.97] No, do I look like a thief to you?
[1408.57] No madam, I didn’t mean that.
[1410.73] You weigh it quickly and tell me,
how much is it worth.
[1413.33] Fine, I will tell you.
[1414.37] I don’t know what he thinks of himself.
[1417.33] Ramsha, what are you doing?
[1418.57] What will you get out of selling this?
[1421.13] Money, what else?
[1422.80] Have you forgotten,
[1423.67] mama always says that
the gold is for bad times.
[1426.23] So when a person is going through bad times,
[1428.00] then sell this gold and earn money.
[1430.07] So when are your children dying of hunger
[1431.77] that you have to sell this
and fulfill their needs.
[1434.17] Sit quietly.
[1435.73] I have to celebrate my birthday.
[1437.13] If mama and papa are not giving me money,
[1438.20] then I will have to do something like this.
[1441.13] After all,
[1442.00] I will celebrate such a birthday that
the world will watch.
[1444.60] My videos will go viral everywhere.
[1446.67] I will have a better celebration than Hania.
[1449.60] You just wait and watch Miss Annie.
[1452.80] Madam, for this we can…
[1474.63] If elder mama or elder papa ask you
[1476.73] where is the jewellery set,
what will you say?
[1479.07] This is my issue, you don’t worry too much.
[1481.87] How does everything become
so easy for you?
[1484.00] What are you?
[1488.47] All of you will find out soon
what I am.
[1493.87] So you be quiet and don’t worry.
[1496.37] After all,
[1497.00] did you see the grand video
Hania made for her birthday party.
[1501.53] You need even more money to
make a better video than that.
[1504.03] So you have to do all this.
[1507.17] By the way, Annie, I was thinking,
[1511.47] we will make the birthday video.
[1513.27] Why don’t we spend this money to make a video?
[1516.77] Good idea.
[1517.33] Hold it. Hold it. Quickly hold it.
[1518.83] I will bring the ring light.
[1520.87] I will keep it here,
[1522.97] okay?
[1524.33] And here, I have kept the phone.
[1525.77] Now you stand up quickly.
[1527.67] I will put up the phone here,
and I will walk from there.
[1530.13] Get up, Annie.
[1530.93] I will come walking from here
[1532.17] so you have to shower the money
from behind me, okay?
[1534.60] Have you gone mad?
[1535.87] Who does this?
[1537.47] Hey…
[1540.43] What no one does, we will do it.
[1542.87] After all, to make a good video
you need to do something unique.
[1546.33] If there will be something different
then people will watch it,
[1548.27] that’s when we will get views,
that’s when we will get likes.
[1550.73] You don’t get likes just like that.
[1553.47] I will turn on the ring light.
[1554.93] If someone sees this money, then?
[1559.83] How would anyone know?
[1561.53] Mama and aunt are sleeping anyway,
[1564.13] Shani, uncle and papa are at the shop.
[1566.13] The two of us are here. Who else
will watch it other than us?
[1568.40] No one, right?
[1569.20] So be quiet, and stand here
and shower the money, okay?
[1573.27] Fan,
[1574.13] where is the fan?
[1576.40] Yes, it is here.
[1578.63] Now, why are you picking up the fan?
[1581.20] Man, see, when I put the fan on
the sofa over there,
[1583.60] then my hair will fly,
[1584.83] and when you shower the money,
[1586.93] it will be blown away even better,
the video will be much better with this.
[1592.03] Come on. Come on. Come on. Ready?
[1593.20] Come on stand here quickly
and shower the money like this, okay?
[1595.57] Okay.
[1596.27] One,
[1597.93] two,
[1598.97] three. Okay.
[1600.63] Should I throw it?
[1602.03] Yes.
[1611.67] What is going on?
[1613.40] You people are not at peace
so late at night even?
[1615.77] Aunt.
[1617.47] You were sleeping. How did you wake up?
[1620.00] So I was sleeping,
[1621.57] I was not dead.
[1631.03] This  money? Where did all this
money come from?
[1632.93] Hey, this money,
[1634.83] aunt.
[1636.07] Aunt, this money. Annie.
[1639.53] Tell your mama that this money…
[1641.07] I got it from my Tik Toker friend
to make a video.
[1644.77] These are all fake notes.
[1647.17] Hey aunt,
[1649.17] this is the thing about these notes.
[1650.87] They look so real when making the video,
that you cannot imagine.
[1654.23] You know I too had seen them
making a video too.
[1656.03] The notes look really real.
Absolutely.
[1659.57] Annie,
[1661.37] come on,
[1662.53] come and sleep quickly.
[1664.17] It is late at night.
[1665.17] Yes, mama.
[1665.87] Come on.
[1668.73] Annie, bye.
[1669.80] We will make the video tomorrow. Okay?
[1671.67] Goodnight.
[1673.37] Goodnight, aunt.
[1692.40] Ramsha,
[1694.37] what is the name you have put up?
[1696.13] Ramsha Sajid.
[1697.97] Such names don’t work on social media.
[1700.37] You do one thing,
[1701.97] you name yourself…
[1705.27] yes,
[1706.63] Ramsha Khan.
[1708.83] Does the name make a difference?
[1710.53] It makes a lot of difference.
[1712.00] These Khans are really famous
on social media from the start.
[1715.83] Now look at me.
[1716.80] Hania Khan.
[1718.17] There is an attraction in the name.
[1722.03] You are right.
[1723.80] Yes.
[1724.87] Think about what I said.
[1726.97] And right now I have to do something small,
[1728.67] I will go do it and come.
Okay.
[1730.23] Okay. Bye.
[1740.40] Here you go.
[1741.87] Annie, you took so long.
[1743.80] Hey,
[1745.03] there was so much rush in the canteen.
I was getting so angry.
[1747.67] You do nothing yourself.
[1749.07] You make me do the work at home
and here as well.
[1751.80] Lazy bum.
[1756.17] Ramsha,
[1757.67] today is your birthday, right?
[1759.27] Yes.
So what is the plan?
[1760.67] Yes, today is my birthday,
[1762.47] all of you are invited, okay?
[1764.03] I will send the location on Whatsapp in a while,
[1765.63] so all of you come, okay?
[1767.13] Okay. Bye.
[1769.00] Bye.
[1769.97] What?
[1771.13] Ramsha, are you really planning
on celebrating your birthday?
[1774.13] Yes, so what else?
[1775.47] I am not mad that I sold my gold chain.
[1778.00] Obviously, I have to celebrate my birthday
[1780.07] and I will celebrate a birthday better than Hania,
[1782.07] you just wait and watch.
[1786.63] Come on, man, we are already late.
[1787.80] Come on. We will eat…
[1788.77] hold this.
[1789.80] We will eat something and then
we will go for the class.
[1791.07] Come on.
I have to hold this as well.
[1792.43] Yes, you have to.
[1799.27] So Fahad is the party even interested or not?
[1802.27] Man, I feel that the party is interested.
[1808.63] Okay, if they are interested, then fine,
[1810.73] I will talk to dad, we will make a deal with them.
[1813.27] So talk to him, where is uncle?
[1816.33] Man, he went to another city
with a religious congregation.
[1821.07] He will be back tonight.
[1827.03] Oh man, she will not let me work peacefully.
[1831.83] Who is it?
[1836.67] Hello.
[1837.73] It has become my unfulfilled desire that
Mr. Afnan picks my call on the first bell.
[1843.27] I am talking to you, do you hear me?
[1846.07] Yes. Yes,
[1847.33] I hear you.
[1848.53] You know, today is my birthday.
[1851.73] Oh, okay.
[1855.20] Happy birthday.
[1857.13] Hey, just happy birthday won’t work.
[1859.87] Today you will have to come to
the party in the evening,
[1862.57] I am quickly sending you
the location, you come there soon, okay?
[1865.37] I will try.
[1867.40] Hey, Afnan, see, I know that you are really busy,
[1870.33] you don’t have time at all.
[1871.73] You have a lot of work to do,
[1873.43] but no work should be more important
for you than me.
[1876.00] You are coming in the evening, okay?
[1880.00] Okay fine, then you send me the location
[1881.87] I will come over, okay?
[1883.20] Are you sure?
[1884.60] You will come, right?
I will wait for you.
[1887.27] Okay bye. Goodbye.
[1892.73] Who was she?
[1893.57] Party. What? What?
[1896.03] Who was she?
[1898.33] Hey, man
[1900.13] it was not that important a person
that I tell you who she was.
[1904.27] Tell me about the party,
what do we have to do?
[1905.83] Or else I won’t talk to dad.
[1907.73] If you are not interested then, it is possible…
[1910.97] What do we have to do about the party?
[1913.23] Let me work on the details for it, please.
[1941.13] No, no, no, no,
[1942.60] I cannot be part of any plan of yours.
No, Ramsha.
[1946.43] Man, Annie, come on.
[1948.60] I promise you no one will find out anything.
[1951.13] We will have a lot of fun. Please, come on.
[1953.63] How can you say that no one will find out?
[1956.00] If someone finds out,
[1957.83] then we will be in trouble
and brother will choke me to death.
[1960.97] It is not as easy as you think it is, Ramsha.
[1963.67] I would say you too don’t do it.
[1966.67] Annie, I am telling you nothing will happen.
[1969.87] You know,
[1970.73] I have booked the hotel
by paying so much money.
[1973.80] What do you want that
all my money goes to waste?
[1977.40] Oh God,
[1979.13] who had told you to give the money?
[1981.77] If you don’t want to go, then don’t.
[1983.93] What do you think I cannot
do anything without you?
[1985.83] Yes.
[1986.37] You think that.
[1988.73] I don’t need anyone,
not even you, understand?
[1994.40] Fine.
[1995.57] May God guide you and also
put some sense in you as well.
[2001.53] I don’t care.
[2003.03] I don’t know what they think of themselves.
[2005.33] I am enough.
[2011.83] Here you go.
[2013.23] Oh,
[2015.73] today there was a lot of work,
I got tired.
[2018.83] There was a lot of rush.
[2020.37] Anwar too went for some work,
I had to take care of all the work.
[2024.27] Why? Where was Shani?
[2026.97] He went to the warehouse for cleaning.
[2029.80] We are getting new stock,
we had to make room for that too.
[2031.73] Greetings.
[2033.33] How are you, papa?
[2034.53] I am fine, child. You tell me.
[2035.63] I am fine.
[2036.73] Okay mama, I will get late on my way
back from the coaching.
[2039.83] My friend, Savera,
[2041.37] her mother is unwell,
so I have to take her to the hospital.
[2044.40] Hey,
[2045.20] why will you take her mother to the hospital?
[2047.43] She will take her, herself.
[2048.67] Hey mama, what is wrong with you?
[2050.17] You people know her mother is handicapped.
[2052.87] How will that poor thing take care
of her mother alone?
[2055.57] So it is necessary for me to go.
[2057.80] So, she will have a father, ask him.
[2059.47] Her brother must be there,
why do you have to go along?
[2062.33] Hey mama, she has no one in this world.
[2065.17] No sister, no brother, no relative.
[2067.43] She only has a father,
who too is in Dubai.
[2069.83] Now tell me, how will
she manage all this alone?
[2072.43] Papa if I do a good deed,
[2074.23] then it will be good,
make mama understand this.
[2076.63] Hey let her go.
[2078.00] She is going to do something good,
God will be happy.
[2080.80] Go child.
[2081.37] Okay fine,
[2083.23] tell me, till when will you come back?
[2084.87] As soon as my work…
[2085.87] I mean, as soon as the work in
the hospital will get done,
[2089.17] I will come immediately.
[2091.00] Okay, come soon.
[2092.03] Okay. Goodbye. Bye.
[2096.17] What have you cooked today?
[2098.17] Yes, I made spinach meat.
[2100.93] Serve food, I am hungry.
[2102.83] I will just serve it.
[2111.23] Hi everyone, this is me Ramsha Khan,
[2113.20] and today is my birthday party
[2115.27] and here are all my friends.
[2117.00] Everyone say hello quickly.
[2118.37] Hi.
[2119.60] Through this video, all of you can
be part of my happiness.
[2122.37] Don’t forget to wish me. Bye.
[2125.07] Come on, now all of us will
take picture. Come on.
[2126.80] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2127.97] Everyone come behind me.
[2129.03] Come on. Come on.
[2130.37] Ready?
[2133.43] Yay.
[2168.43] Ramsha is not back yet?
[2173.37] Why did you give her permission
to go to her friend?
[2177.77] Salma, it was a good deed,
how could I say no?
[2182.73] Although, I had asked Ramsha
to come back soon.
[2186.77] I don’t know if that girl’s mother’s
health is fine or not?
[2189.87] God be kind, what if she has
got really unwell.
[2192.43] So, you do one thing,
[2194.00] call and find out.
[2195.80] That’s the issue.
[2197.13] I have been calling her for so long,
she is not answering my phone.
[2201.20] Hey Annie,
[2202.73] child, you do one thing,
[2204.43] that you call Ramsha’s friend,
[2206.27] and ask them if they came home
from the hospital or not,
[2209.13] and how is that girl’s mother is like.
[2211.43] Call her, child.
[2213.80] Annie,
[2215.03] what is your elder mama asking you to do?
[2218.80] Elder mama,
[2220.93] I don’t have her friend’s number.
[2223.80] Okay tell me,
[2225.27] why did you not go to coaching today?
[2228.73] I didn’t have a class today.
[2230.87] I am in group A, and there
was a test for Group B.
[2234.23] Ramsha is in group B, so she went.
[2237.43] I am surprised.
[2239.43] Her father got the admission done together
[2241.87] so that both sisters will come and go together.
[2244.43] I don’t know what drama these
coaching people of yours have started.
[2247.07] A, B, C, D.
[2249.73] Sister in law, don’t worry,
[2252.17] she will come. Come on.
[2253.63] Come on.
[2254.73] Come. She will come.
[2256.60] She will come.
[2288.00] Oh man, Afnan, answer the call.
[2290.67] You are already really late.
[2292.73] You always do this.
[2297.53] Ramsha.
Yes?
[2298.67] How much longer will it take? Cut the cake.
[2301.80] I am getting calls from home
again and again, I have to go.
[2304.07] You know, I too am getting
calls from home, but…
[2307.73] Then who are you waiting for?
[2309.47] Ramsha.
Yes?
[2310.57] Come on, it is late, let’s cut the cake.
[2312.57] Come on. Come on.
[2315.03] Come on, man.
[2316.37] Come on. Come on.
[2318.07] Come on.
[2319.07] Everyone come, we will cut the cake.
[2321.83] I will light it.
[2322.83] Okay, ready?
[2326.93] Happy birthday to you.
[2329.80] Happy birthday to you.
[2333.03] Happy birthday Ramsha.
[2336.27] Happy birthday to you.
[2339.83] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2343.47] Ramsha. Ramsha. Ramsha.
[2347.47] It is not there.
[2350.57] Come on, let’s take pictures.
[2361.17] Sister in law,
[2363.77] didn’t Ramsha come yet?
[2365.67] No Salma,
[2367.07] she has not come yet.
I am really worried.
[2369.37] I am calling her, this girl is not
answering my phone.
[2372.63] It is really late right now.
[2374.57] Where did she go right now?
[2376.23] Hey, son, Shani, she went to coaching
[2379.37] and then she was saying
she would go to her friend’s home on her way back,
[2381.77] because her mother is not well,
she has to take her to the hospital.
[2385.00] Child, you do one thing,
that you go to Savera’s home
[2388.23] and find out if Ramsha has
come from the hospital or not?
[2391.57] Fine, I will go.
[2393.23] I will find out, you don’t worry.
[2394.83] You come with me.
[2396.83] I don’t know where Savera lives.
[2399.53] Why?
[2400.77] Why don’t you know?
[2402.23] You have gone to Savera’s home
several times with Ramsha.
[2405.43] Not several times, mama.
[2406.93] I just went a couple of times
[2409.87] and Savera’s home is on the inside,
[2412.37] you have to go through different lanes,
[2414.00] I get lost every time I go.
I don’t remember,
[2415.87] where will I take brother?
[2417.03] You just stay stupid forever or else
[2419.23] a person learns the way going once or twice.
[2423.20] Okay mama, one second.
[2424.27] You come with me, I will find out.
[2425.77] Yes, yes, child, you go with him.
[2428.13] Shani knows everyone there,
he will find out their address.
[2431.93] Go child.
[2435.87] Oh God,
[2437.43] it is really late now.
[2439.60] Sister in law, don’t worry.
[2441.43] Shani has gone.
[2443.20] You sit down.
[2443.77] Leave it. Come on.
[2444.83] This girl…
Sit. Sit.
[2451.20] Man…
Are we late?
[2453.40] We are really late, man.
[2456.00] I don know…
[2465.83] Hello.
[2466.93] Hey, you?
[2468.43] You came really soon.
[2470.33] Right now, no one has come.
Why did you come so soon?
[2476.20] Traffic.
[2477.23] Traffic. You know the traffic of Karachi well.
[2480.03] Even if a person leaves on time,
still they get stuck somewhere and get late,
[2483.00] like me.
[2484.80] You don’t believe?
[2486.23] Then you ask Fahad.
[2488.57] Speak up Fahad.
[2489.53] Fahad will tell you. Fahad will tell you
[2491.73] and Fahad is my best friend.
[2493.43] And you know what Fahad’s
quality is? You know,
[2495.40] Fahad never lies, he always
speaks the truth, right Fahad?
[2498.47] Fahad, this is Ramsha,
[2500.77] and today is Ramsha’s birthday.
[2503.23] Happy birthday Ramsha.
[2505.13] Thank you.
[2506.47] I wanted to introduce you to
all my friends, you are so late.
[2509.77] Hey, we will meet them some other day,
what is wrong?
[2512.00] Right now, introduce me to your
family where are they?
[2513.73] Or did you not invite them too?
[2516.73] Family?
[2517.93] I will keep a separate party with my family.
[2520.17] This was just with friends.
Okay.
[2522.20] Yes.
[2522.53] Okay, come on, I will show you
the videos of the birthday party. Come on.
[2526.13] Oh videos. Yes, yes.
[2527.83] Come on. Come on.
I will come in a bit.
[2529.00] Come on.
A bit?
[2531.03] You enjoy.
[2532.03] Hey, stay.
[2534.07] Okay, come on.
[2545.37] Where is her home?
[2554.60] Annie, tell me something,
[2556.40] you have brought me to this
street for the third time,
[2558.07] where is it?
[2560.47] Brother, I think it is the street
in front or the back street.
[2564.13] I don’t understand.
[2565.53] I mean, some landmark?
You must know something.

[2571.63] We have passed from there twice.

[2588.33] Let’s go back home.
