[30.24] Excuse me.
[32.36] Your phone.
[34.08] Thank you.
[36.60] What was she doing 
with your phone?
[38.92] Dad had said that she had 
to make an important call.
[41.12] Did you make the call?
[41.88] Madam Alizay, come quickly.
[43.52] What happened?
[44.48] Elder madam is unwell.
[46.92] I am coming.
[50.56] Listen. Hello.
[52.28] What happened?
[53.36] Where are you going?
[54.56] To aunt, she is unwell…
[55.56] She is not your aunt.
[57.80] You are here for a few days,
[59.64] so stop making these
 relations. Understand?
[61.56] No aunt, no uncle
 and nothing else.
[65.72] You don’t need to come to 
the room. Understand?
[89.20] Madam Ramsha.
[90.32] Thank God you have come.
[91.76] I was waiting for you for so long.
[93.28] I have told you so many times,
[94.92] once you are done with 
work, then come over.
[97.92] You talk to me, 
so my attention is diverted.
[100.76] Leave all that, have sweets.
[103.76] Really?
[104.92] What is the happiness?
[106.44] Wont you share your 
happiness with me?
[108.52] Elder sir sent these
 sweets for you.
[111.52] Really?
[112.40] Little sir and madam
 Alizay’s wedding has been fixed.
[115.08] They are getting 
married this month.
[130.36] Really?
[135.80] You go, I am coming.
[152.08] Mama, come to the doctor.
[157.80] Your blood pressure got so low.
[160.72] If you get unwell further, then?
[167.04] No child,
[167.96] I don’t have the strength
 to go to the doctor.
[174.76] But don’t worry,
 I will be fine.
[177.44] After all,
[178.68] I have to shop for 
my daughter’s wedding as well.
[189.12] Okay,
[190.24] I will call the doctor
 home, right?
[192.72] Hey, no, no,
[193.88] what is the need to 
call the doctor home?
[196.36] I just checked aunt’s 
blood pressure,
[198.84] it is normal.
[208.08] But when I spoke to the 
doctor on the phone,
[212.40] he was saying that 
aunt needs to rest
[214.04] and we need to keep her 
away from tension and stress.
[217.24] We don’t have to give 
her any stress.
[226.96] In fact, do one thing,
[229.92] go make fresh juice for her. Right?
[235.56] She must be feeling weak.
[238.20] Yes?
[239.80] Yes, I will drink juice, child.
[242.32] Fine.
[243.60] Immediately. Immediately. Quickly
[245.72] and make it well.
[251.00] Aunty, amazing,
[254.24] you acted so well.
[256.48] You impressed me today.
[261.64] You believe your aunt, right?
[263.84] I believe you?
[265.04] I am going to call the 
Oscar people to
[267.04] give my aunt the award 
for the best actress.
[269.40] Had you not acted so well,
[270.96] then Alizay would never have 
agreed to getting married.
[273.16] Had I known earlier that
[274.56] Alizay would become so
 emotional because of my illness,
[277.68] so that I would have 
done this drama earlier.
[281.56] Lower your voice, 
she is really smart.
[283.52] It is possible she hears us,
[285.00] and if she does she will get upset.
[287.00] But I love you. I love you.
[290.08] I love you too, Afnan.
[303.48] What did you people do?
[304.88] Hey man, you missed it.
[306.16] You know that’s why 
I was asking you to come along.
[308.36] Man, I should have come 
along with you people,
[310.68] but you know I had 
to go to the office,
[312.52] so I couldn’t go.
[314.88] Yes madam, you and your office.
[317.24] Anyway, I am leaving.
[318.88] When dad comes tell him that
[320.48] I will get a little late in coming.
[322.64] Okay, fine.
[323.68] Okay.
[337.16] Congratulations Alizay.
[346.24] I just had sweets
[347.32] so I found out that
[350.00] the wedding date for you 
and Afnan has been fixed.
[358.68] Yes, the date for the end
 of this month has been fixed.
[369.60] Oh wow, this is good news.
[373.24] By the way,
[374.08] it is a good thing about 
cousin marriage,
[381.16] you know all the good
[383.80] and bad things
[389.28] and you still accept each other.
[408.76] That is true,
[410.36] now see, me and Afnan know 
everything about each other.
[422.72] I know all his good 
and bad sides.
[425.80] Do you really know 
everything about him?
[441.92] What do you mean?
[445.24] Alizay.
[445.72] Yes.
[446.28] What was I saying?
[448.64] You wanted to go to 
Savera’s home,
[450.72] so her home is on the way,
[452.20] I will drop you.
[454.48] Yes, that’s a good idea.
[456.00] Yes, come on. Let’s go.
[457.68] Yes,
[458.40] what is the point of going separately?
[460.64] Let’s go.
[461.28] You know,
[462.12] I too wanted that I talk to Savera a little.
[468.84] I was just a little busy.
[470.96] You tell me, is everything okay?
[472.92] I am fine.
[474.16] I feel you don’t have time for me at all.
[477.88] No, nothing like that.
[479.32] I have just some work at the office,
[481.16] there is a lot of work in the office.
[483.20] Yes, so?
[484.04] If you cannot talk to me in the office,
[486.32] so what?
[487.16] You can go home and talk to me.
[489.00] When you are at home, call me.
[491.48] When I am at home,
[493.12] I want to spend the 
most time with my family.
[496.28] I really like spending
 time with my family.
[506.96] My mama and papa 
want to marry me.
[511.64] Your marriage?
[512.64] Yes.
[515.88] But why? What is the hurry?
[518.40] You make them understand.
[519.84] Tell them you want to 
resume your education,
[523.72] so you cannot get married right now.
[525.96] |I am tired of making 
them understand,
[528.00] those people are not 
willing to agree to me.
[531.04] Okay relax.
[532.84] Don’t get so stressed, so quickly.
[535.20] You tell them, that you want 
to be a girl from today’s times.
[541.72] Such a girl who is strong, 
independent,
[544.76] well educated,
[545.92] someone who can stand
 on her own feet.
[548.28] I am sure they will agree.
[554.72] You know, if you had not
 come to meet me today,
[556.96] then I would have gotten 
upset with you.
[561.52] You would have done good.
[563.24] You know,
[564.08] I am also thinking that
[566.92] I stop talking to you.
[570.08] Huh? Why?
[574.48] What?
[575.64] What are you thinking? Speak up.
[581.40] I am thinking that
[583.52] if I hadn’t come to meet you, then
[587.16] would you have really
 stopped talking to me?
[589.28] Yes, I would have absolutely
 stopped talking to you.
[591.44] You don’t meet me or talk to me,
[593.12] then why would I talk to you.
[595.04] After all,
[596.00] it has been so many days,
[597.56] you should know me well by now.
[601.84] You are right about that, but
[604.20] you will be surprised to hear that
[607.28] not only do I know you,
[610.32] I also recognize you well.
[623.40] Dad, trust me.
[626.04] This girl will be completely 
safe in that hostel.
[628.92] I know the manager of
 that hostel well,
[632.56] in fact, you can say that he
 is a really good friend of mine.
[634.80] I have spoken to him,
[636.04] he is saying he will take 
care of this girl’s food,
[637.88] when she wakes up and sleeps.
[640.20] Afnan, I cannot trust any 
stranger in the matter of this girl.
[644.36] Dad, why don’t you understand me?
[646.84] I am not telling you that 
you break ties with this girl
[650.76] or you give up her responsibility.
[653.24] I am just saying
[654.92] she will be able to live a 
better life in the hostel.
[658.12] After all, dad,
[659.72] I don’t like it,
[661.40] people outside, everywhere
 who are finding out about this girl,
[664.04] they are talking about us.
[665.80] They are saying what is 
a young girl doing in this home?
[671.52] Greetings.
[673.24] Yes, doctor.
[675.44] What?
[677.92] Yes, I am coming. I am coming.
[680.76] What happened, dad?
[681.48] Thank God.
[683.32] Hey, sister Mehnaz has 
regained consciousness.
[686.88] God has listened to us.
[688.96] God has listened to us.
[690.88] Ramsha.
[692.48] Ramsha, child.
[694.16] Ramsha.
[706.16] Mama.
[708.00] Ramsha, child, are you fine?
[711.92] Yes, mama, I am absolutely fine.
[713.84] Are you fine?
[716.08] I am fine.
[716.96] Sister Mehnaz,
[718.84] you don’t worry about Ramsha at all.
[722.08] She is like my daughter,
[724.60] once you get fine,
[726.44] you will take care of her yourself.
[728.96] yes..
[731.40] yes..
[735.32] Mama. Mama, what is happening?
[736.68] Staff. Staff
[738.08] Mama, I am with you.
[738.80] Look at her condition.
[739.56] You will be absolutely fine.
[740.20] I had told you people 
not to talk to the patient,
[742.04] you people, please go out.
[742.84] Child, come on. Come here.
[743.64] Call the doctor.
[744.56] Yes, they are checking, child.
[746.08] Come quickly, call the doctor.
[794.48] Ramsha.
[808.88] I have brought the phone 
dad asked me to bring.
[818.04] I have put the sim in it,
[822.00] and you know well how to
 use every type of phone.
[842.12] By the way, can 
I tell you something?
[851.20] As happy as you are about 
your mother regaining consciousness,
[862.36] I am way more happier than you.
[866.68] Because now I am sure 
you will leave from this home.
[876.72] Your plan will fail.
[879.68] Mr. Afnan,
[883.68] what do you think of yourself? Huh?
[889.56] If I tell your father about you and me,
[893.84] he will not ask you for justifications.
[901.28] In fact, even if I tell your entire family,
[904.96] then no one will ask
you for justification,
[907.24] they will hold you responsible.
[912.48] What will you tell them?
[919.16] You are threatening me?
[924.20] What do you have to tell them?
[931.60] That I befriended you?
[939.40] I didn’t make any
 promises to marry you.
[947.80] I think you are forgetting
 something, Ramsha.
[954.84] I could have taken undue advantage
 of you in your friendship,
[966.88] but I didn’t do that.
[972.56] In fact, I helped you,
[974.72] at different places.
[976.20] I saved you from troubles 
and problems.
[978.36] I did a favor on you,
 and you will tell people this?
[982.04] Did I ask you to be my friend?
[987.56] No, right?
[988.72] You were interested in Alizay,
[991.04] you used to love her.
[997.60] Then why did you take 
a step towards me?
[1000.12] Why did you love me?
[1006.00] Hey, I have understood 
men like you well.
[1013.88] You people hold on to the crutches
 of friendship, by acting decent…
[1017.16] Shut up. Just shut up.
[1020.96] Why?
[1022.12] Can you not handle the truth?
[1027.68] If you were this decent, then
[1029.52] you should have stayed true to Alizay.
[1034.96] Why did you take a step towards me?
[1036.72] Why did you love me?
[1039.36] You don’t have an answer, right?
[1049.20] You will never have an answer either.
[1130.28] The tea is getting cold, Afnan.
[1135.84] Afnan, where are you lost?
[1137.08] Your aunt is saying something to you.
[1147.20] I am really sorry, aunt.
[1148.88] What were you saying?
[1153.16] The tea is getting cold, drink it.
[1155.20] You are not answering.
[1157.08] No, no, dad,
[1159.76] I was thinking about the contract 
we are working on nowadays,
[1162.44] that is why…
[1164.64] I am in no mood to have tea.
[1170.36] Brother,
[1172.92] then what did you 
decide about Ramsha?
[1175.88] Now her mother has 
come out of the coma.
[1184.64] But right now, she is
 not completely fine.
[1191.28] May God give her health,
[1193.36] she will regain health soon.
[1198.68] Brother, I was saying that
[1201.56] after a long time a wedding
 is coming in this home.
[1206.84] Guests will start coming 
over in some time.
[1217.24] Then me and Alizay will be
 really busy in shopping.
[1223.00] In this situation leaving Ramsha 
alone in this home is not reasonable.
[1235.52] Afsheen, you are right.
[1240.56] I have decided that as soon
[1244.68] as sister Mehnaz regains health.
[1247.28] When she comes home,
[1249.28] I will get a separate home on rent
 for sister Mehnaz and Ramsha.
[1264.48] So that both these mother and
 daughter can live there comfortably.
[1266.84] I have even asked
 the estate agent,
[1268.36] that if he knows someone trustworthy,
 he should show us that home.
[1280.16] Fine brother,
[1281.56] the charity and zakat we do,
[1284.16] we will give it to this
 mother and daughter.
[1293.64] After all, taking care of
 a widow is also a good deed.
[1310.24] and telling people about your 
good deed is like wasting the good deed. 
It is called showing off.
[1325.08] Yes, Ramsha child,
[1327.08] you want to talk about 
something? Tell me.
[1345.72] I was saying that don’t worry for us.
[1351.28] Once mama gets fine,
[1352.40] I will make arrangements 
for me and mama.
[1371.16] You have already done
 so much for us,
[1373.44] don’t do anything more than that.
[1377.68] Child, God is the 
One makes ways.
[1379.68] May God give you strength
 and courage.
[1385.84] He does it for everyone. 
He helps everyone.
[1404.16] And yes,
[1406.16] I didn’t do anything for you, child.
[1415.36] I did it for myself.
[1417.96] This way, we will also get some
 good deeds written in our fate.
[1423.88] So that God forgives our 
mistakes and wrongdoing.
[1429.76] Live long.
[1469.24] Yes, greetings dad.
[1476.88] Yes, dad, fine.
[1480.48] I will bring her.
[1481.96] Yes, don’t worry, 
I will bring her immediately.
[1484.92] Goodbye.
[1501.76] You please call the driver.
[1504.56] Call the driver and find out when 
he will come. My mama.
[1508.56] My mama. Afnan. Afnan.
[1511.48] Afnan, you know my mother 
has got really unwell.
[1522.72] She is in the hospital,
[1524.12] and the doctor has said she cannot breath.
[1526.00] You please take me to mama.
[1528.08] If something happens to mama, then
[1529.56] I will not be able to forgive myself.
[1531.68] I want to meet her.
[1532.88] I want to see her. Please…
[1535.04] Okay.
[1541.08] Nothing will happen to your mama.
[1548.32] You just pray for her.
[1550.60] Be strong.
[1552.68] Do you want to go with her?
[1553.88] Yes,
[1554.36] the doctor has said 
she is taking my name.
[1556.72] She want to talk to me.
[1557.88] You please take me quickly Afnan
[1559.68] Okay,
[1561.48] you stop crying. Come with me.
[1566.36] You please come on.
[1568.40] Mama, what is all this?
[1572.04] Ramsha is worried.
[1573.80] Why do you worry?
[1712.36] Mama, get up. Mama. Mama,
[1717.44] nothing happened to you.
[1718.56] You know, you are absolutely fine,
[1719.60] mama. Mama, get up.
[1720.92] Mama, you cannot leave 
me alone like this.
[1723.08] Mama, who will I live with?
[1724.72] I have no one. Mama,
[1726.12] how can you do this with me?
[1731.76] Mama, see I am here.
[1733.56] You will be fine.
[1734.40] You will be absolutely fine.
[1735.72] Mama, how can you do this with me?
[1736.76] Who are you leaving me with, mama?
[1744.48] I have no one in the world.
[1746.00] You know that.
[1746.84] Get up. Get up, mama.
[1748.00] Please, get up. See, I am here.
[1749.48] Doctor. The doctor will come
[1751.20] and you will be fine.
[1752.36] Nothing will happen to you.
[1753.88] You cannot leave your 
Ramsha and go like this.
[1756.76] Mama. Mama, get up. 
Mama, please.
[1763.64] Mama, please, get up.
[1767.40] Mama, please listen to me,
[1768.84] don’t leave me and go like this.
[1771.00] Mama, don’t leave me and go, mama?
[1773.52] Mama, who will I stay with?
[1774.60] You know I have no one other than you.
[1776.92] Papa left as well. 
Who will I live with you?
[1779.12] Why are you not getting up, mama?
[1780.12] Mama, see, open your eyes.
[1781.52] Open your eyes and look at me.
[1782.72] Why are you listening to me?
[1785.32] You, get up.
[1790.88] Mama.
[1818.72] You know the children of our home
 are really soft hearted.
[1821.80] They sympathize with people
 as soon as they see tears in someone’s eyes.
[1825.28] In this sympathy,
[1826.44] Afnan took her to the 
hospital with him.
[1828.36] You are worried for no reason.
[1831.52] Mama, did you not see
[1835.20] how Ramsha was reacting?
[1842.52] Like she know Afnan for a long time.
[1848.44] I still don’t understand 
what happened.
[1853.04] Did you not see 
how badly that girl was crying?
[1864.52] When you and 
I can feel sorry for her, then
[1867.28] Afnan too would have 
felt sorry as well.
[1878.08] Mama, but I am surprised,
[1881.40] Ramsha has not been 
in our home for long.
[1888.76] But she is meeting Afnan, like
[1891.20] she knows him for a long time. 
She knows him for ages.
[1893.80] Alizay, look at her mother’s 
condition, it is really serious.
[1903.48] In this worry,
[1904.56] Afnan came in front of her
[1905.36] and she went to the 
hospital with him.
[1907.24] That’s what I am trying to 
make you understand.
[1916.92] Afnan is calling.
[1925.24] Hello.
[1926.84] Greetings.
[1928.40] What happened Afnan?
[1934.76] Oh.
[1939.96] Okay Afnan, let me 
know whatever happens.
[1945.84] Okay.
[1949.20] Her mother passed away.
[1951.32] Tsk. Tsk.
[1955.48] I had told you,
[1957.24] this is why she went to the hospital 
with Afnan in such a hurry.
[1995.60] Mehnaz,
[1997.16] this is the same Ramsha right?
[1999.64] She grew up so quickly.
[2002.72] I remember the day when
[2004.04] the nurse gave a doll in my arms,
[2007.16] that sir, you had a daughter.
[2009.44] I thanked God,
[2011.76] that thank you God,
[2014.04] you sent blessings to our home.
[2016.00] Hey, you ask me,
[2017.72] who has tolerated 
her every single day.
[2020.04] Your daughter has 
grown up with difficulty.
[2022.12] Do you see that?
[2022.92] Do you hear that?
[2023.96] She tolerates me daily.
[2025.40] It is good you heard
 it yourself today.
[2027.04] Hey, no child, your mother 
really loves you. She is joking.
[2031.00] I know that.
[2032.08] Mama loves me the most.
[2040.88] What does you getting 
embarrassed do?
[2044.92] You know, me and your father
[2046.52] are tired of giving clarifications 
and lying to the neighbours.
[2051.76] Mama, I promise you,
[2054.44] after today,
[2055.68] I will do whatever you
 and papa say,
[2057.28] and however you say it.
[2060.32] But please forgive me, 
and give me one chance. Please.
[2067.20] If someone breaks 
someone’s trust for one time,
[2072.88] then you don’t trust them again.
[2080.16] What happened child? Ramsha,
[2082.64] why are you scared?
[2084.12] Did someone say something to you?
[2086.08] Did Shani say something?
[2087.32] No mama, no one said something,
[2089.64] I am just really scared.
[2092.04] Why child?
[2092.84] Why are you scared?
[2093.96] What are you scared about?
[2095.88] I am afraid of myself.
[2097.28] I feel that I am really filthy,
[2100.76] I am really bad,
[2101.96] I am really scared. I don’t like it.
[2105.20] No my love, there is nothing like that.
[2106.92] There is nothing like that.
[2108.24] Don’t think that.
[2110.28] You don’t know what I saw just now.
[2112.92] I saw that I am really 
scary on the inside.
[2116.24] I am really filthy and bad.
[2118.44] Mama, I am not good. 
I am really bad.
[2121.28] No child,
[2122.24] see, you would have 
surely seen a dream.
[2125.36] I have told you to recite 
Ayat ul Kursi before you sleep.
[2128.64] You must not have recited it,
[2130.40] that’s why you are scared.
[2131.56] This was a dream, child,
[2133.44] it has nothing to do with reality.
[2135.20] It was a dream?
[2135.84] Yes, my love and I am with you,
[2139.00] you don’t need to be scared at all.
[2140.96] Mama. Mama,
[2143.12] you don’t leave me and go.
[2144.52] I am really scared.
[2146.76] No my love, how can 
I leave you and go?
[2149.04] I am with you, my child.
[2161.76] Okay, be quiet.
[2162.76] Everyone bothers me,
[2163.88] everyone taunts me, 
everyone is cursing me.
[2168.76] Mama, what do you people think that
[2171.36] the wedding got canceled,
[2173.40] I got made a joke made
 out of everyone?
[2176.16] I got insulted in front of everyone.
[2179.08] Do I not feel pain?
[2180.64] Am I not tortured? I am really sad,
[2183.56] my papa left me and went.
[2185.00] I am in a lot of pain.
 I feel my heart will stop.
[2188.96] I cannot tolerate what 
everyone is saying.
[2192.00] Okay. Okay.
[2198.68] Now the situation is not like before.
[2201.36] Earlier your father was alive,
[2205.12] but now
[2206.96] I cannot take any decision alone.
[2211.32] It feels like we are standing
 in blocked streets
[2216.56] and even if I close the windows 
out of the fear of the storm,
[2220.92] still we will suffocate to death, child.
[2226.04] Try and understand,
[2228.56] I have become weak child,
[2230.60] I have become a widow.
[2232.80] I cannot take the burden of any
 wrong decision of yours on my shoulders.
[2237.08] I cannot take up the burden now.
