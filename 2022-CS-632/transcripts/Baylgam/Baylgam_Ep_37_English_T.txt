[32.76] What are you doing Afnan?
[34.16] What? Nothing.
[35.36] Just randomly. You tell?
[41.68] I feel so pity for Ramsha today.
[50.52] Just a few days ago she was so happy
[52.88] when her mom got back consciousness
[62.76] and now all of a sudden 
she passed away,
[70.96] I couldn’t even imagine what
 she must be going through.
[79.20] Mothers are so important, right?
[82.88] Even I lost my mother in childhood.
[94.00] The pain of losing a mother
 at such a young age,
[104.00] no one can know that better than I do.
[120.36] Uncle is very depressed too,
[128.92] he blames himself for all this though
[139.36] it was just an accident,
[142.12] Afnan only you can convince him.
[145.80] I have tried multiple times,
[149.88] I am so hurt looking at
 him in this condition
[157.80] but you know it very well that
[160.36] Dad is a very sensitive person,
[163.76] very God-fearing
[169.44] that is why it will take him 
some time to get normal.
[173.88] Yes, true that.
[178.84] Where is Dad though?
[181.56] Umm, he is in his room.
[188.40] He has asked Mom that 
no one should disturb me,
[191.40] he doesn’t want to meet anyone.
[210.04] Afnan?
[212.00] I was saying that
[213.44] I and you should go out somewhere.
[221.32] My heart feels so low after 
the entire routine of the day today,
[224.68] I was thinking to go out with
 you somewhere.
[227.56] I am so sorry Alizey, but
[230.20] I don’t feel like going out at all.
[235.84] I can understand.
[244.68] I completely understand
[246.56] whatever you are feeling,
[252.80] if we go out somewhere,
[254.60] your mind will be diverted too,
[258.20] let’s go somewhere.
[261.40] Thank you.
[264.16] Okay let’s go.
[266.24] Come.
[290.04] brother, I am getting 
breakfast served,
[292.32] come let’s have breakfast.
[294.44] Umm,
[295.80] call Ramsha for breakfast too.
[298.60] Tabassum went to her
[300.56] so Ramsha said she is not hungry,
[302.28] you come.
[305.68] You get the breakfast served,
[308.68] I will bring her.
[346.60] Look,
[355.68] no matter what I say,
[358.64] or any word or any comfort
[361.68] cannot heal your pain right now,
[363.64] these words are nothing 
in front of your grief,
[367.68] Ramsha, my child, trust me 
I can understand your pain.
[370.52] You are lying,
[372.16] you are lying,
[373.84] the pain and hell that 
I am going through right now,
[376.92] you cannot even feel that,
[379.04] I have lost my mother,
[381.28] just because of you,
[383.40] I have lost my mother because of you.
[392.92] Look my child, I was saying that…
[394.76] Enough!
[395.76] Enough! Just stay quiet.
[400.44] Do you know that
[402.40] you have everything,
[404.52] you have a house a 
family and everything
[407.80] and I,
[414.28] I just had a mother,
[416.44] I just had a mother left,
[418.40] you even took that away from me.
[421.16] You even took my mother away from me.
[424.28] You even took away my mother from me.
[427.08] My child, I admit it is my fault but…
[429.28] You didn’t commit any mistake,
[431.72] will I get my mother if you admit or not?
[434.48] Can my loss be recovered?
[436.48] My loss won’t be recovered, right?
[438.28] My mother won’t come back, right?
[440.20] No right?
[441.04] You have murdered my mother,
[448.12] you killed my mom,
 you are a murderer,
[451.04] you are a murderer.
[452.16] You have committed a murder.
[453.32] Just shut up!
[455.40] How are you talking to my dad?
[456.72] What I am saying is absolutely right,
[458.16] your father killed my mother.
[459.88] Shut your nonsense!
[461.36] Afnan, stay quiet.
[462.12] No dad,
[462.96] she shouldn’t have the audacity
 to talk in front of you.
[468.20] Why?
[469.36] Because I am telling the truth?
[470.48] You are unable to hear the truth, right?
[471.88] Because truth is bitter.
[476.80] All of you won’t be able to hear my truth,
[478.92] you all are my mother’s murderers.
[480.12] I will.
[480.96] What are you doing Afnan?
[482.00] Leave me.
[483.68] What is wrong with you all?
[488.40] Has anyone dared to talk to
 dad like this in this house ever?
[491.80] Do you think I am mad?
[493.92] I mean, she is talking to dad like this
[495.92] and you all are just 
watching this drama?
[498.00] Afnan?
[498.92] I am saying go away from here.
[505.48] Afnan, go if brother is asking you to go.
[509.60] Let’s go Afnan, let’s go.
[521.36] They took my mom away from me.
[523.72] they took my mother…
[568.20] Enough Afnan,
[569.72] its good uncle sent you to the room,
[572.16] why are you getting so 
hyper by the way?
[573.80] So what should I do?
[575.44] Didn’t you see how that girl 
was misbehaving with dad?
[581.96] She was talking to him 
in such loud tone
[583.60] and what didn’t she say to dad,
[585.12] she even called him a murderer.
[586.80] Tsk, Afnan?
[588.60] Try to understand her condition too,
[591.36] her mother has just passed away,
[593.32] I mean this is not the time
[594.92] we should tell her what 
is wrong and right.
[600.96] Didn’t you see
[601.88] uncle was even quiet?
[603.56] Dad’s silence gave her
 the audacity to
[605.48] misbehave with Dad so much
[607.68] else she is not worth it.
[614.16] And why are you telling me?
[616.44] Didn’t you see it for yourself
[617.48] with your own eyes how 
she was talking to Dad?
[622.88] Her tone? I felt like killing her.
[625.84] Afnan, you have gone mad.
[626.96] Yes I have gone mad,
[629.68] if that’s how it is then just 
consider me mad
[635.48] but let me tell you one thing,
[637.72] if she talks to dad in 
that tone ever again,
[642.52] I won’t tolerate it and 
I will do anything.
[644.92] What is wrong with you Afnan?
[647.12] You will not raise your hand 
on a girl, right?
[650.56] Okay, relax now,
[652.68] please calm down,
[654.40] it’s not that big of an issue.
[665.88] it is a huge issue for me.
[684.64] In the name of Allah, The Most 
Gracious and The Most Merciful.
[690.44] Afsheen, Ramsha didn’t 
come for food?
[694.60] Brother, I sent Tabassum to her
[698.72] she said she is not hungry.
[706.56] She will eat when she is hungry,
[708.80] you must relax and eat.
[714.12] And by the way, brother the 
misbehavior that she just did,
[717.40] do you think
[719.12] she can really sit with us and eat?
[728.68] I even told you earlier that
[731.28] she cannot adjust with us.
[737.56] And you have just watched 
it as well right now.
[741.56] What happened, uncle?
[742.88] Where are you going?
[744.52] To bring Ramsha.
[745.72] Dad, please?
[752.56] Look Dad if you will bring
 her here like this,
[755.72] she will never realize her mistake.
[760.40] It’s not her fault,
[768.28] we are the ones at fault.
[780.56] I won’t even call it a fault, but a sin.
[788.48] A person left this world 
squirming in pain
[800.24] and we were the reason behind it,
[803.16] if that’s not a sin then what is it?
[842.96] Greetings, may peace be upon you,
[844.80] may I come in, my child?
[846.08] Yes.
[849.64] Come, let’s have food.
[855.12] You have come here to
 call me to eat?
[858.00] Yes.
[860.72] I thought you,
[863.96] I thought you would ask 
me to leave your house.
[868.20] Why would I say that?
[870.52] That you should leave my house?
[873.92] You know what I am saying.
[885.16] What are you looking at, my child?
[887.80] I am looking that
[891.08] I misbehaved so much with you,
[899.52] I called you so many wrong names,
[902.16] said such things to you,
[903.36] called you my mother’s murderer
[909.16] and in return,
[913.76] you are behaving so 
politely with me?
[920.88] You are not asking me to
 leave this house, in fact,
[922.76] you are calling me to have food.
[926.48] Why?
[931.64] Because I am afraid of God.
[941.00] Come, have food.
[986.56] Come, my child.
[988.52] Come, good girl.
[1016.28] Alizey, serve food to Ramsha.
[1020.84] Where is the plate?
[1021.52] Afnan, pass me the plate. Afnan?
[1028.68] Afnan,
[1034.24] pass the plate.
[1050.88] Have it, have it my child, eat.
[1112.52] She is such an ill-mannered girl,
[1115.36] look at brother,
[1116.92] he went to convince her,
[1118.80] there is a limit to being down to earth,
[1121.76] if her mother had this much life written,
[1124.36] then what is brother’s fault in it?
[1126.76] You tell me something?
[1128.72] Who treats strangers like this?
[1131.16] Hey, people just hit people
[1133.12] and leave them dying on the road.
[1136.28] But his girl doesn’t realize anything.
[1140.40] Mom,
[1141.76] I was thinking that
[1142.92] do we not have anything to discuss
 anymore except Ramsha?
[1147.32] Because when I go to Afnan
[1149.48] he is always getting 
angry at Ramsha,
[1151.88] when I go to uncle,
[1153.28] he is worried for Ramsha,
[1155.00] even you are just saying 
Ramsha, Ramsha, here,
[1158.16] I am tired of listening 
to her name.
[1160.64] do we not have anything
 else to talk about?
[1162.52] Yes you are absolutely right,
[1165.24] we are getting worried
 about such a useless thing
[1168.20] and by the way,
[1169.28] there is very less time left 
for your wedding now,
[1172.12] I was thinking Alizey,
[1174.12] why don’t you and Afnan go out 
for wedding shopping tomorrow?
[1179.40] No mom,
[1180.52] Afnan’s mood is not good,
[1183.88] you start with your shopping,
[1185.68] let Afnan get better
[1187.20] and let his mood get fine
[1188.60] then I will go and shop with him.
[1192.88] Okay.
[1236.12] My child, I admit it is my fault but…
[1238.16] You didn’t commit any mistake,
[1240.72] will I get my mother 
if you admit or not?
[1243.32] Can my loss be recovered?
[1245.52] My loss won’t be recovered, right?
[1247.24] My mother won’t come back, right?
[1249.16] No right?
[1250.16] You have murdered my mother,
[1254.64] you killed my mom,
[1256.48] you are a murderer,
[1257.48] you are a murderer.
[1258.60] You have committed a murder.
[1259.84] Just shut up!
[1261.84] How are you talking to my dad?
[1263.12] What I am saying is absolutely right,
[1264.60] your father killed my mother.
[1272.96] What have I done out of being emotional?
[1277.16] I misbehaved so much with uncle,
[1280.92] mom lived the life that 
was written for her,
[1286.04] after all, what is uncle’s 
fault in all this.
[1290.68] I have made a mistake,
[1292.88] I should have talked to him like this.
[1297.92] I should apologize to him.
[1316.96] It is time for Fajr,
[1319.04] I am sure he will go out for prayers,
[1322.00] I should talk to him.
[1352.32] Greetings, may peace 
be upon you, Ramsha,
[1355.04] my child, what are you 
doing here at this time?
[1357.60] Is everything all right?
[1359.80] I wanted to talk top you 
about something important.
[1361.72] Sir I will ask the driver to take 
out the car, you may come then.
[1364.24] Yes.
[1367.16] What is it, my child?
[1369.44] I am here to apologize to you.
[1375.12] Uncle,
[1376.48] I have made such a huge mistake,
[1378.68] I said so many wrong things to you,
[1380.48] I don’t know what did 
I say to you out of angry,
[1382.84] I don’t know what did I say,
[1384.16] you just forgive me once,
[1386.96] I am guilty from my heart.
[1388.24] Hey?
[1388.84] You do everything for God, right?
[1390.80] Forgive me for God.
[1391.76] Hey, what happened?
 What are you doing?
[1393.60] God won’t even forgive me unless 
you forgive me from your heart,
[1397.12] uncle, please forgive me.
[1399.44] Look Ramsha, I am not upset with you,
[1402.12] get up and sit, sit here, sit here.
[1406.36] Forgive me.
[1409.28] My child, you haven’t done anything.
[1412.92] You didn’t do anything on purpose.
[1414.96] When we get scared a person
 doesn’t know what they are saying
[1421.44] but trust me,
[1427.32] even I am very upset about 
sister Mehnaz’s death,
[1432.88] May God grant her 
the highest ranks.
[1435.92] To Him we belong and to 
Him shall we return,
[1438.52] we all have to return 
back to Him. You,
[1447.16] you just have patience, 
my child.
[1449.88] Have patience.
[1451.72] Uncle,
[1454.40] do you know
[1455.64] I have tried a lot to have patience
 somehow and I get peace,
[1460.44] but my heart is not at peace, uncle.
[1465.64] I beg you, help me,
[1468.16] I am not getting peace, uncle.
[1470.44] Look, God has said in the Holy Quran
[1474.20] hey people of faith,
[1475.68] seek help from patience
 and prayers,
[1477.96] indeed, God is with the 
ones who are patient.
[1480.32] You must offer prayers,
[1483.64] you must talk to God,
[1485.80] share your feelings in front of him,
[1487.68] and present yourself to him.
[1491.96] It is time for Fajr prayers,
[1493.80] I must leave now.
[1494.28] Uncle,
[1496.32] you have forgiven me, right?
[1500.80] Do you know that
[1502.48] your tears are very precious,
[1505.08] don’t shed them in 
front of human beings,
[1509.32] you must present
 them in front of God.
[1514.64] God has blessed 
you with the grief,
[1518.04] you must pray for me, yeah?
[1521.12] Pray for me.
[1582.88] Oh Lord!
[1586.76] Grant my mother 
a place in Jannah,
[1590.36] Oh Lord,
[1592.92] grant my mother highest ranks 
in Jannah,
[1598.20] grant both my mom and 
my dad highest ranks in Jannah.
[1604.60] Oh Lord, give me peace,
[1606.68] my heart is so worried,
[1609.88] bring peace in my life.
[1613.60] Show me the right path.
[1617.76] Allow me to offer prayers.
[1626.24] Oh God, get me out of this trial,
[1631.44] I am so helpless,
[1633.12] I don’t have anything in my control.
[1635.28] Help me,
[1637.68] help me, Amen.
[1661.32] Afnan?
[1663.20] Hey?
[1663.76] Oh I am sorry.
[1672.00] Have you gone mad?
[1675.72] Where is your concentration?
[1677.44] You ruined my whole jacket.
[1726.04] What is all this Afnan?
[1727.52] You with that cheap girl?
[1729.28] How can you even think 
like that about me?
[1731.80] Oh
[1732.68] so I can’t think like that?
[1734.32] But I am watching everything Afnan.
[1739.00] And I don’t like this at all that
[1740.60] she should roam around you.
[1742.20] Get her out of this house 
immediately.
[1744.12] Send her to some shelter 
home, it is not my problem.
[1746.08] Oh so what do you think 
I want her to stay in this house.
[1749.32] So then do something.
[1771.96] I will have to do something.
[1800.20] Ramsha, leave all this,
[1803.72] immediately go and pack your bags,
[1805.76] you are going back to your house.
[1808.04] Afnan?
[1808.52] There is no need to say anything,
[1810.44] just do as I say,
[1812.60] pack your bags
[1814.24] and go to dad
[1815.40] and tell him you don’t want to live here,
[1817.16] you are going back home,
[1818.96] tell me the address of your house.
[1832.96] Okay fine, you can speak
[1835.28] but you will just tell me 
the address to your house,
[1838.32] if you say anything else apart from it,
[1840.08] I will be the worst.
[1844.60] You won’t tell me like this,
[1845.76] I will have to do something myself.
[1846.76] I don’t have any house,
[1849.36] I have already told that to your dad.
[1853.24] What do you think that
[1855.12] I will get trapped in all what
 you are saying, just like dad?
[1860.12] I know you very well Ramsha,
[1862.60] I know your cunningness 
very well that
[1864.48] why have you come and sat here.
[1866.72] You think that I will get scared of you?
[1868.60] There is nothing like that
[1870.28] and where do you used
 to live before here?
[1871.92] On the moon?
[1872.88] If you don’t have a house,
[1874.68] if you don’t tell me your address,
[1876.88] I will find it out myself. 
Just wait and watch.
[1878.80] When fathers are alive,
[1881.64] this land is also like a 
moon for daughters.
[1889.92] After my dad passed away,
[1891.36] that house is no longer mine,
[1893.08] and the people who live 
there are not my own as well.
[1903.36] What do you mean?
[1903.92] Your dad passed away?
[1905.32] Yes Afnan,
[1907.60] you were so uninformed
 about me that
[1909.64] you don’t even know this.
[1918.00] And I,
[1920.16] I lost everything in love with you.
[1928.36] The love that you never
 even confessed
[1933.20] and I was the one who 
suffered the punishment.
[1941.20] Do you know?
[1942.52] Do you know what 
your friend did to me?
[1945.32] On my wedding day,
[1946.56] he accused me of your love,
[1949.12] he dishonored me 
in front of everyone,
[1951.56] and my wedding got 
called off because of him.
[1954.12] Look, I did tell him…
[1955.00] Enough!
[1956.64] You have spoken enough,
[1966.12] I got such disgrace because 
of what your friend did,
[1970.40] my father couldn’t bear that,
[1972.40] he couldn’t tolerate it,
[1974.44] that shock took my dad’s life.
[1982.44] Whatever happened with 
my mother is all in front of you, Afnan.
[1995.88] I lost everything in the
 process of loving you
[2003.56] and what did you lose?
[2006.84] Nothing.
[2011.60] Nothing, Afnan.
[2040.88] So what were you telling
[2042.28] about Ramsha’s wedding?
[2045.60] Yes, the story was left incomplete,
[2048.12] then what else,
[2049.28] who would just see everything 
and still go for it?
[2051.16] When I told aunt,
[2053.00] aunt humiliated them so much,
[2056.32] we came back with the groom.
[2066.28] Who are you calling now?
[2070.24] I was calling Fahad but 
the call is not connecting.
[2073.12] Fahad, Fahad has gone to Dubai.
[2076.24] Dubai?
[2078.00] When did he go to Dubai? 
He didn’t tell me about it.
[2080.80] Yes, it has been so many 
days no since he left,
[2083.28] he didn’t tell you?
[2086.72] No he didn’t tell me.
[2090.48] Okay, Anyway,
[2091.80] I came to ask you
[2093.00] if you are free today shall 
we go for shopping?
[2095.56] I need to buy a few things.
[2098.56] Why not?
[2100.20] We will definitely go.
[2106.32] Have I ever said no to 
you ever before?
[2109.60] I don’t even have anything 
special to do today,
[2111.32] and I will cancel the
 ones that I have.
[2114.40] Okay.
[2159.80] Why are you looking 
at me like this?
[2161.80] do you need something?
[2163.24] I am just looking at the fact that 
how lovely daughters are.
[2170.52] You bring food for me 
daily in the morning,
[2178.96] you take care of me all day,
[2185.84] without even a frown on your face,
[2189.28] you are the same girl
[2192.44] who would get fed up if 
I ask you to do any work.
[2200.52] But now,
[2203.72] you look so mature.
[2208.80] There is no need to say anything,
[2210.96] just do as I say,
[2213.08] pack your bags
[2214.76] and go to dad
[2215.80] and tell him you don’t 
want to live here,
[2217.84] you are going back home,
[2225.72] What do you think that
[2227.60] I will get trapped in all 
what you are saying,
[2231.56] just like dad? I know you 
very well Ramsha,
[2234.04] I know your cunningness 
very well that
[2235.76] why have you come and sat here.
[2238.20] You think that I will get scared of you?
[2240.00] There is nothing like that
[2241.88] and where do you used 
to live before here?
[2243.24] On the moon?
[2244.36] If you don’t have a house,
[2246.00] if you don’t tell me your address,
[2248.24] I will find it out myself. 
Just wait and watch.
