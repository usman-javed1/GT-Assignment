[21.24] Okay Ramsha, now forgive me,
[24.28] I mean,
[25.88] I have been apologizing continuously
[28.44] and you are showing attitude, 
what is this behavior?
[31.56] So when did I ask you to apologize?
[34.76] So that’s even better,
[36.88] you have got a husband who is accepting 
his mistake without you having to ask for it,
[41.08] you should be happy.
[43.04] Yes, I have actually got a 
very nice husband,
[45.84] a kind of husband that 
I never even wished for.
[49.44] Okay enough now, forgive me.
[57.96] You know my anger is dangerous,
[61.00] I fail to understand what is right 
and wrong.
[69.64] You shouldn’t do that,
[71.76] I have asked you multiple times 
not to make me angry.
[79.64] Okay forget everything, 
come with me.
[83.40] Where?
[87.72] I am getting a new bike,
[92.52] and that too of your choice, 
whichever you like.
[98.40] So come with me.
[104.20] Why are you looking 
at me like this?
[107.96] I have arranged money too,
[113.36] now there is no problem, 
you just come along,
[115.60] I just want it to be of your choice.
[121.08] So, let’s go.
[135.36] Ramsha,
[139.36] I love you a lot,
[141.84] I don’t understand how to express it
and do you know
[147.16] when I thought of buying a new bike,
[150.96] I just knew it will be of your choice, 
the one you like.
[159.20] Now forgive me and come with me,
[162.92] we will buy a new bike.
[166.40] You get ready I ma waiting 
for you downstairs.
[207.64] Afnan, did Shani come to your office?
[216.00] Is everything okay?
[218.84] Umm,
[220.64] Dad, see what has happened to my memory,
I forgot to tell you.
[224.36] When I reached office, what did I see? 
Shani was standing in front of me,
[228.28] a guy works there, he turned out 
to be his friend.
[231.68] Now it doesn’t seem nice 
that I avoid him
[234.08] so, I invited him to my office,
[236.80] offered him tea,
[238.28] he sat for a while, had tea and left.
[240.56] That’s great, and why would you 
avoid him?
[243.68] It wouldn’t be nice if he had left 
without meeting you.
[246.72] If you give respect to the son-in-law, 
the daughter gets respect at her in-laws.
[252.28] Brother, you have made Shani 
your son-in-law,
[257.04] though you don’t have a daughter 
and you are pampering your son-in-law.
[264.64] Afsheen, you talk such strangely
 sometimes,
[272.32] everyone’s daughter is a daughter.
[285.08] If someone hasn’t been blessed 
with a daughter,
[289.72] for him the daughters of everyone 
are of equal respect, lovable.
[307.16] People who get to pamper and 
spoil daughters are very fortunate.
[325.00] Now look,
[327.12] I don’t have a daughter but how God has 
given me a chance to pamper a daughter,
[339.52] what else would I want, yeah?
[342.68] Yes, you are right.
[344.80] Now look,
[346.80] despite being an uncle,
[348.88] I pampered and spoiled my 
daughter Alizeh like a father.
[359.52] By the way, I agree to the fact
[361.72] that you give a lot of love and 
respect to all the daughters.
[365.40] Thank God.
[370.36] I don’t see Alizeh around?
[371.68] She didn’t even come to eat, 
is everything all right?
[374.24] Yes, she wasn’t quite well 
so she slept.
[378.32] May God make her well.
[402.32] Oh wow,
[404.88] you have done wonders.
[406.92] It means you are two steps ahead 
from your father.
[416.48] This is called that the snake dies 
without breaking the stick.
[425.16] See how wonderful your son is.
[433.76] By the way, sometimes I feel
[436.68] I am more intelligent than you.
[445.00] I mean to say that after all 
whose son am I?
[455.76] By the way I am very surprised 
about a fact
[462.32] that Afnan gave you money 
instead of Mr. Qasim
[471.04] and that too without asking for it,
[476.60] it means that
[479.80] just like Mr. Qasim, Afnan is also 
very concerned about our Ramsha.
[487.68] Yes Dad, and that’s what has been 
bothering me a lot as well.
[493.76] Whatever importance Ramsha has 
in Mr. Qasim’s house
[498.68] is only because of Mr. Qasim,
[502.36] moreover,
[504.20] what’s surprising is that 
in Mr. Qasim’s house,
[508.00] even his servants give 
the same respect to Ramsha
[511.04] like she is the owner of that house.
[521.84] What are you thinking?
[524.36] Nothing,
[527.60] I will take Ramsha along and 
show the new bike there.
[536.56] She will get happy as well and 
Mr. Qasim will even see that
[539.64] his money is being spent right.
[541.68] Hey, why not? Why not? 
You must definitely go
[551.08] so he even gets to know
[553.00] that just by his little favors,
[556.08] Ramsha gets so much happiness 
in her life
[559.40] so he does these favors often.
[562.64] Yes dad,
[564.60] I will even show them and 
brag about it.
[568.88] But the shop…
[570.16] Don’t worry about the shop 
when I am here,
[573.36] I will take care of it.
[580.64] Go, my son, Go.
[605.96] Then Shani just said that 
I have bought a new bike
[608.24] so let’s go and show it to uncle first.
[611.76] It’s great that you came, 
I was just missing you.
[615.80] I was missing you a lot too, Uncle.
[617.68] Greetings.
[618.64] Greetings, may peace be upon you. 
Greetings.
[620.60] Hey, how are you here such 
early morning?
[623.40] Actually, Shani bought a new bike
[625.96] so he said let’s go and show it 
to uncle first.
[637.16] I was just telling Uncle that he wanted
to come last night
[639.96] but then I told him that it’s night, 
we will go to Uncle’s house in the morning.
[649.96] It’s great that you came,
[651.32] come let’s have breakfast together.
[654.28] No, no, Uncle, 
I have had breakfast.
[659.80] I thought since you have come in morning,
we will have breakfast together,
[663.20] it has been so long I haven’t had
breakfast with you.
[667.32] Okay fine,
[668.64] let’s do one thing, we will have
 breakfast together
[670.80] but I will only have tea.
[675.44] yes, that’s like it.
[676.88] Do one think, go ask Alizeh and 
Afsheen to serve breakfast,
[680.24] yeah?
Okay.
[682.36] Stay blessed.
[696.32] Home becomes so lively 
when Ramsha comes here.
[707.48] Happiness spreads in this home 
by the smile of this girl, right?
[721.20] Thank God.
[732.20] Mom,
[734.56] what happened? 
The breakfast is not ready yet?
[736.92] I am getting late.
[739.04] Tabassum has gone on leave 
for 4 days,
[746.24] and Rasheeda’s daughter is not well.
[749.08] Let me order something for you 
from outside.
[752.68] You know that I don’t like outside food.
[756.24] then tell me what should I do?
[758.20] Umm Uncle was asking about breakfast.
[761.32] Rasheeda is on leaves
[763.60] so I thought of ordering something 
for her from outside.
[767.16] Okay don’t worry,
[768.96] I know what you guys have for 
breakfast, I will make it.
[773.28] Okay.
[777.96] See
[779.40] she immediately got a chance to earn 
brownie points in front of uncle.
[809.44] Ramsha? 
Yes?
[811.44] What are you doing here?
[813.24] I am making breakfast, Afnan.
[814.88] But why are you making breakfast, 
that’s not your job.
[823.96] It is not for you to do all this, 
where is Tabassum,
[826.44] where is aunt, she should have 
stopped you. Aunt?
[828.84] Aunt?
[829.84] Why are you calling Aunt, Afnan?
[833.00] who should I call if not her?
[834.76] I will ask her why are you 
working here?
[840.48] Aunt?
[842.56] Aunt, please listen to me.
[844.64] Afnan, what is wrong, listen to me, 
at least.
[852.04] There is no need to call aunt.
[853.84] It is not a big deal if I am making 
breakfast and
[856.96] Aunt felt like having fried flatbread 
made by me, that is why I am making it.
[863.08] Aunt felt like it?
[869.72] It is surprising,
[871.48] she never feels like having breakfast 
made by her daughter,
[883.68] why does she want to have it 
made by you?
[890.32] I am telling you she does all this 
on purpose to bother you.
[895.64] Forget it, Afnan, what’s the point?
[906.64] If you start arguing with aunt, 
it will ruin the breakfast atmosphere,
[915.64] and all my hard work will go to waste,
[917.48] the breakfast is almost done anyway.
[928.00] You go sit on the breakfast table,
I will serve it.
[935.00] Okay.
[960.24] Why do you do this, Ramsha?
[961.56] Exactly, brother,
[963.00] I stopped her so much but no,
she didn’t listen to me for once,
[967.00] she made the entire breakfast.
[988.76] I even said that you have come here 
for a while but no,
[993.04] when does she listen to me.
[999.04] Daughter, it was different before,
you used to live here,
[1002.60] now you have come as a guest,
[1004.00] what is the need to come 
and do all the work?
[1011.12] It’s okay Uncle, 
it’s not that big of a deal.
[1020.24] And Ramsha wouldn’t have servants 
in her home anyway, brother,
[1028.44] she must be doing all the work herself.
[1047.04] Dishes, breakfast, right Ramsha?
[1057.88] So that is good, Afsheen,
[1060.16] Good daughters are the one 
who adjust with the situation.
[1064.60] You can’t by being selfish,
[1067.08] you live it by being selfless. 
Stay blessed.
[1118.44] Ramsha? 
Yes?
[1121.00] Where are you going?
[1122.52] To my home, where else will I go?
[1124.76] Umm, you are going alone?
[1127.60] Yes.
[1133.68] Shani dropped me and 
went to the shop
[1136.60] and Aunt has gone to a relative’s house,
[1138.68] Annie is all alone at home 
so I will have to go alone.
[1143.28] So, listen, let me drop you.
[1147.96] No, no, I will manage myself, Afnan.
[1150.60] Hey, I am going to the office only,
[1152.84] your house is on my way, 
I will drop you,
[1154.96] I am getting late, hurry up let’s go.
[1157.48] But Afnan? 
What but Afnan?
[1162.08] It doesn’t seem nice that you get 
bothered because of me like this.
[1172.60] I will manage on my own 
by a taxi or a rickshaw,
[1174.68] why are you bothering for no reason?
[1179.60] And what if I say that
[1182.56] I won’t be bothered 
but I will be glad, then?
[1299.84] Oh okay,
[1301.40] you are using your academy as an excuse
and going to meet Afnan, right?
[1305.96] There is nothing like that, Alizeh, 
I am not going to meet Afnan.
[1310.88] I am going to the academy 
with the driver.
[1313.24] Don’t lie to me,
[1314.84] Afnan just left for office a while back
 and now you are leaving too.
[1318.80] You two cannot meet in front of me,
[1320.56] that is why you have planned 
to meet behind my back, right?
[1325.64] Look, I know you feel insecure 
regarding Ramsha,
[1330.16] but I just want to clear that we just had
a temporary friendship between us
[1335.60] which is not there anymore, 
it doesn’t exist at all.
[1338.44] Afnan, I cannot share you with anyone,
 you know that, right?
[1342.64] And that Ramsha wants to take you
away from me, I know.
[1346.40] I know that very well.
[1348.76] Please, you won’t leave me, Afnan,
[1350.68] don’t leave me, 
I cannot live without you,
[1352.92] I will go crazy I am telling you.
[1354.56] Yes, yes Alizeh, I know that 
you love me a lot
[1358.08] but trust me, I love you a lot too,
[1361.12] I cannot even think about 
anyone except you
[1364.56] and I promise you 
I will never leave you,
[1367.96] please take out this insecurity 
from your heart,
[1370.68] there is nothing between
I and Ramsha,
[1373.84] I am yours, just yours.
[1398.60] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1400.44] How are you Annie?
[1402.36] I am fine.
[1404.52] Where is aunt?
[1406.04] She is inside, did Afnan drop you?
[1408.96] yes, Afnan has dropped me. Why?
[1414.44] Shall I ask you something?
[1417.44] yes, go ahead.
[1420.12] Don’t you feel weird facing Afnan?
[1431.36] I mean that between you guys…
[1436.24] I don’t have any answer to your question.
[1447.00] The ones who do wrong to someone 
or betray someone, are scared.
[1461.96] And I haven’t done anything with anyone.
[1471.96] Why should I get scared or get nervous,
[1475.36] I have never done wrong to anyone, 
that is why my heart is very satisfied.
[1480.16] You are right,
[1486.60] I am just thinking that I wish 
you could have gotten him.
[1493.76] You know what, Annie?
[1495.60] whatever happens,
happens for good.
[1507.08] And a person should learn to agree 
with the decision of His God,
[1514.40] then there will just be peace in life.
[1518.00] I am very happy
[1519.52] that you have started to trust in God.
[1521.96] That’s a huge thing.
[1524.00] Yes,
[1525.36] trusting God is a huge blessing.
[1534.40] When a person has faith in God,
[1538.00] they become carefree.
[1549.32] Now let’s go inside. 
come.
[1566.36] so, you got the time?
[1568.52] what do you mean?
[1570.16] What was the need for you 
to drop Ramsha, Afnan?
[1573.24] what is such a big deal 
if I dropped her?
[1581.12] Why are you getting so angry?
[1583.28] she came here with her husband,
[1585.24] she should have gone back with him, 
why did you go to drop her?
[1588.76] She asked you and you went?
[1590.28] Dude, she didn’t ask me,
I offered her to drop her.
[1594.88] yes, what is the need for her
to say anything anyway?
[1597.44] When she is getting all the facilities 
without saying
[1600.28] then why would she say anything?
[1609.92] I have to ask you Afnan,
[1617.96] and you show all your tantrums to me.
[1625.44] Sometimes you are not in the mood, 
sometimes you don’t have time.
[1629.88] Look, now you are fighting 
for no reason.
[1632.20] I am not fighting for no reason,
[1634.12] Ramsha gave me a reason to fight,
[1644.76] but you never see any mistake of her,
[1647.80] I am the one who is always at fault.
[1657.00] You are not doing good to me, Afnan.
[1659.56] Now why are you quiet?
[1660.96] Why don’t you answer me? 
What should I say, dude?
[1668.80] You have a problem when I answer 
you have a problem when I don’t answer,
[1676.96] I don’t want to fight for no reason,
that is what I am trying to tell you.
[1680.36] Is it something to fight about?
[1686.72] I am avoiding a fight, nothing else.
[1718.44] You shameless girl.
[1723.00] Don’t you feel any shame?
[1725.44] How can you betray us big time?
[1728.84] Hey, what is wrong with you? 
Come with me and talk.
[1731.72] What is wrong with me?
[1736.68] Yes, yes, you will come 
to save your lover.
[1746.76] What did you think?
[1748.20] Both of you could have fooled me 
together and I will keep on tolerating?
[1751.84] I wouldn’t be able to find out anything,
[1754.68] Fahad has told me the whole truth.
[1767.96] Alizeh, I have made coffee for you,
[1770.04] have it, it will fix your mood.
[1772.88] I don’t feel like having it.
[1775.36] Why are you and Afnan always fighting?
[1781.36] If Afnan makes a mistake, 
you must ignore.
[1786.32] I should ignore?
[1793.60] Mom, I feel that he hurts me 
on purpose
[1796.64] so we are always just fighting.
[1799.76] Alizeh, you guys are not kids anymore,
the way you fight.
[1808.60] It has been a year to your marriage
 by the way,
[1817.52] now you must think about 
completing your family.
[1824.36] If there will be baby between you guys,
[1826.80] both of you will end all your conflicts 
and get busy with the baby.
[1834.76] And my child,
[1836.00] a child makes the relationship of 
a husband and wife, stronger.
[1840.72] Now you must think about this.
[1844.00] what are you saying, mom?
[1846.56] I am not planning a family at all 
for the next 2 3 years.
[1850.92] So why not?
[1853.12] It has been a year to your marriage,
[1858.64] you must think about 
family planning now.
[1865.16] Mom,
[1866.52] I am thinking to do PHD,
[1872.88] I thought I will give you a surprise 
by telling this
[1879.60] but you don’t let anything be a 
surprise anymore.
[1883.56] How much more will you study? 
You are already done studying.
[1891.48] And whatever you want to do 
you are already doing it,
[1895.00] enough now.
[1896.28] Mom, please, I don’t want to talk 
on this topic anymore.
[1901.32] And please mom,
[1902.76] don’t discuss anything regarding this
in front of Afnan,
[1912.00] he will immediately get a chance,
[1913.80] he already loves babies.
[1916.08] That is why I am saying, my love, 
think about babies.
[1929.72] I have to make an important call, 
I am going to my room,
[1938.28] excuse me.
[1943.56] This girl always does what she wants,
[1946.88] she doesn’t listen or understand things.
[1950.04] She is the limit.
[1959.36] Okay, go call Ramsha and 
Shani for breakfast.
[1964.28] They haven’t come yet? 
Let me go check.
[1969.20] What is wrong with you Ramsha, 
is it the time to sleep?
[1978.12] Ramsha?
[1983.20] Ramsha?
[1985.96] Ramsha?
[1989.68] Ramsha? Ramsha, get up.
[1992.52] Mom?
[1993.64] Mom?
[1995.40] What is this? 
Mom?
[1996.56] This is brother’s voice. 
Come.
[2004.64] Mom, come up,
[2007.12] come up, quickly.
[2009.68] Ramsha?
[2011.76] Ramsha, get up,
[2013.60] what happened to her? 
Ramsha?
[2015.12] What happened? Oh God, Oh God. 
Look what happened to her.
[2017.72] Ramsha? 
What happened?
[2019.16] Ramsha?
[2020.28] I don’t know, she fainted. 
Ramsha?
[2022.00] Ramsha. Shani,
[2024.28] she was absolutely fine, tell me honestly 
what happened to her?
[2026.40] God forbid, did you do something?
[2027.52] I wasn’t in the room myself, 
I was at the roof.
[2029.12] I came in and saw that 
she is in this condition.
[2031.28] Shani, tell me honestly 
what happened to her?
[2033.08] did you do something? 
I don’t know, check her.
[2036.04] Ramsha? 
Open your eyes Ramsha?
[2038.40] Ramsha? 
Ramsha, open your eyes.
[2077.88] Shani?
[2079.28] Mom, what happened to her, 
is she fine?
[2081.04] It’s a good news, I will be a grandma, 
congratulations.
[2085.36] What? 
Yes.
[2087.04] Doctor has just said that 
Ramsha is very weak
[2089.60] so take very good care of her and yes,
[2092.08] doctor has written some medicines,
[2094.84] go and get the medicines and 
meet Ramsha as well, go.
[2111.72] I am so happy that I cannot believe it.
[2116.24] That’s it,
[2117.16] someone even younger than me 
is about to come to this home now,
[2119.40] I will be very strict to him.
[2122.00] But why I would be strict, 
I will love him so much, dude.
[2125.00] You know how much I love babies.
[2130.12] Yes, yes, madam, 
I remember it very well.
[2132.52] Aunt,
[2137.12] you that sister Safya,
[2138.64] who had a little baby named Haris?
[2147.08] Just for that baby she would get you 
to make good food
[2150.20] and take it for them so 
she can play with that baby.
[2160.84] And do you remember
[2161.92] when that sister Safya left this area, 
how she was crying?
[2170.80] You didn’t even cry that much 
when grandma passed away
[2173.00] as much as you cried there.
[2175.96] Yes,
[2177.52] I remember it very well this girl 
created such a chaos,
[2181.20] and that too because of someone else’s baby,
such small someone else’s baby.
[2184.60] We couldn’t have kept him 
in our home,
[2186.64] she was already a tenant here, 
she had to go.
[2190.80] What a fool. She brings 
everyone’s babies.
[2194.72] But I won’t have any tension now,
[2196.48] no matter if its my nephew or niece, 
he will always be with me,
[2199.52] there wouldn’t be any tension of him 
going away from me.
[2201.44] yes, yes, you won’t have the tension
of him going anywhere
[2204.32] but we are all tensed for you to leave.
[2208.28] Where am I going?
[2214.04] Umm, don’t you want to get married?
[2220.40] You have to get married and 
go away from here.
[2225.48] yes, Ramsha is right,
[2228.84] if I get a good match for you today 
I will get you married today only.
[2240.08] Mom, I don’t want to get married at all,
[2242.44] and don’t say this to me for 
at least 3 years
[2244.36] no matter how good of a match 
you get for me. Please.
