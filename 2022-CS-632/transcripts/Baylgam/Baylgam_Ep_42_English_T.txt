[20.68] Why is Ramsha pretending to be 
my mother, mom?
[23.24] What was the need for her to uncle that 
there are classes in the evening as well?
[30.40] Who gave her the right?
[33.60] Will she take my life decisions now?
[37.40] I guess she is doing all this so 
she can impress your uncle.
[45.80] Obviously,
[47.12] if she has to permanently stay 
in this house,
[49.20] she will have to do something.
[51.64] Mom, it doesn’t make any
difference to me
[54.36] whether she stays in this house 
or out of this house,
[62.36] she just shouldn’t interfere 
in my matters,
[64.88] tell her in your own words 
because if I will do,
[67.92] she will feel very bad.
[70.36] There is no need for you 
to say anything,
[72.44] I don’t want you to say a thing
[74.60] and she exaggerates it forward 
in front of uncle.
[83.20] Your impression will be ruined 
for no reason.
[85.88] I will talk to her myself Alizeh.
[87.60] That is why I haven’t said anything to her,
[90.00] but next time if she says anything like that, 
mom, I am not going to spare it.
[95.68] Do make her understand,
[99.04] I don’t like anyone interfering 
in my matters
[102.88] whether its uncle or Ramsha.
[106.72] Okay relax.
[115.80] I have to do something 
about this Ramsha.
[137.56] I don’t understand
[140.20] what is wrong with dad
[142.08] that he has kept that girl in this house.
[148.72] Uncle has asked mom to find her 
a good match,
[152.28] now let’s see.
[155.20] really? That’s great.
[165.12] Tell aunt to move things forward 
so that girl can get married soon.
[172.68] Mom doesn’t have a magic wand
[175.44] that she can bring a good proposal 
immediately.
[186.32] It takes some time, Afnan,
[188.96] and by the way, that girl doesn’t have
 any background,
[191.64] she has no family,
[200.16] it is difficult to find good proposals
[202.64] and the potential proposals look at 
what is her education,
[205.48] where has she come from,
what does she do?
[207.28] There is no information about her.
[209.52] Let’s see what happens.
[217.68] By the way,
[219.76] mom has even asked the servants 
of the house
[221.92] to let her know if there is a good proposal.
[232.60] And yes, Aunt Rasheeda recommended
a proposal,
[244.12] but uncle refused,
[246.32] I don’t know what uncle wants.
[252.52] Do one thing, ask aunt
[255.16] to let me know whenever there is 
a good proposal,
[259.92] I will convince dad myself.
[262.80] Okay.
[292.24] Bashir, ask the driver to get out the car,
I have to go out.
[295.76] The Driver has gone to pick
Madam Ramsha from the academy
[300.16] What is this daily drama?
[303.12] I have asked brother 
so many times that my car…
[309.48] Listen,
[311.00] this is not your dad’s car 
that you roam around in.
[316.28] The car belongs to you guys
[319.28] I just went to the academy.
[321.68] You don’t need to act that innocent.
[332.36] If brother has given you space to live
in this house out of courtesy,
[336.24] it doesn’t mean at all
[337.96] that you are a member of this family,
[347.40] and these cars,
[348.92] are for the members of this house 
not for every stranger.
[356.80] Uncle asked me to take the pick 
and drop to the academy with the driver
[361.96] this is why I went with the driver.
[366.48] Hey if brother has said it 
to you out of courtesy,
[369.44] that doesn’t mean you should say 
yes to everything he asks you to do.
[377.08] Have some shame and a person 
should also say no sometimes.
[386.32] You are not a kid that everything 
must be told to you.
[389.64] Be careful next time.
[434.92] Listen,
[436.24] this is not your dad’s car that 
you roam around in.
[441.60] The car belongs to you guys
[444.60] I just went to the academy.
[447.04] You don’t need to act that innocent.
[450.04] If brother has given you space to live
in this house out of courtesy,
[453.84] it doesn’t mean at all
[455.84] that you are a member of this family,
[458.04] and these cars, are for the members
of this house
[462.08] not for every stranger.
[505.04] No,
[506.64] I won't cry now,
[508.92] I will be patient,
[511.20] I have learned it in the class today
[514.04] the one who is patient.
[516.24] God increases their good deeds.
[528.04] And my sins are so much
[531.32] that I really need good deeds,
[534.96] I won’t do it anymore.
[561.28] Oh God, give me patience,
[566.08] I don’t know how to be patient.
[596.24] This is difficult for me,
[599.00] but nothing is impossible 
for you my Lord,
[602.00] give me patience.
[628.60] Greetings uncle.
[629.72] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[632.84] Are you going to the academy 
by the grace of God?
[634.48] Yes.
[635.72] Brother Bashir, ask the driver to drop 
Madam Ramsha to the academy.
[640.40] No, no, I will manage myself,
[642.80] don’t get bothered because of me, 
I will manage myself, uncle.
[645.88] What is in it?
[647.64] How will you go yourself? Driver will
drop you in the car to the academy,
[650.68] what is there to worry about?
[652.76] I will go by the auto rickshaw uncle.
[658.16] I used to travel in the auto rickshaw 
with mom, so I am used to it.
[661.16] Ramsha, my child, when there is the facility
of car available at home
[664.92] what is the need to go in a rickshaw?
[671.04] Uncle, you are forcing me for no reason,
[673.24] I am telling you that I will manage, 
don’t worry.
[677.16] You have already done 
so many favors on me,
[680.72] I feel bad that you get worried for me
 over every little thing.
[684.24] Greetings, brother.
[685.40] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[687.16] Ramsha has anyone said 
anything to you?
[693.48] No, no one said anything.
[701.32] I shall leave now.
[703.12] Sure, go. 
Bye.
[709.88] Brother I will make tea.
[713.16] no, no, I don’t need tea.
[740.28] Alizeh, Even Afnan is not going 
with me to the wedding,
[742.76] at least you come along,
[744.72] it is a family wedding, 
what will everyone say
[747.24] that I have come all alone?
[750.48] Mom, I cannot leave the city for so long.
[761.40] I had taken so many leaves 
for the wedding
[763.88] and now I won’t get leaves again.
[767.44] And my manager has even gone 
for the vacation,
[770.32] it is impossible for me, 
I am so sorry, Mom.
[774.64] Afnan, at least you come along with me.
[777.28] I am not going for a month, we will 
come back in a couple of days.
[780.76] Aunt, Alizeh is not even coming, 
what will I do there alone?
[783.76] I don’t even know anyone there anyway,
[785.80] yes, if Alizeh will go, 
I will happily go with her.
[790.04] Nice excuses both of you.
[793.16] If you are not coming with me at least 
help me with packing.
[797.32] Yes, definitely,
[798.96] do you want me to do it right now? 
Let’s go.
[800.48] Yes sure.
[815.40] Sir Afnan?
[817.20] Sir Afnan?
[820.60] Sir Afnan?
[822.08] What happened?
[831.12] What happened?
[832.16] Sir Afnan, come quickly, 
the elder Sir is unwell.
[840.04] What? Where is dad?
[841.64] In the room.
[848.60] I have given him the injection 
he will sleep for a while.
[851.92] And if he stays sleepy 
you don’t have to worry.
[856.08] Okay. 
Okay?
[857.12] Yes.
[857.92] Okay Mr. Afnan, I even told you earlier
[859.76] that you have to bring him to me for 
checkup definitely once in a month
[864.04] but you have been careless.
[867.92] What can I do doctor? 
Dad doesn’t listen to me.
[877.92] And then you know that our business,
[880.48] I don’t get much time but you are right
[882.64] I will be careful from now onwards.
[890.04] You know it very well that Mr. Qasim 
has diabetes and he is a heart patient
[898.04] and it is very important for him 
to get his checkup done.
[905.44] Now don’t repeat such carelessness.
[916.60] I am changing his medicine.
[918.20] Okay. 
Come with me.
[919.56] Okay.
[1023.00] Alizeh?
[1023.92] hmm?
[1025.56] I actually wanted to say that how 
about you don’t go to the office today?
[1034.16] I was just talking to the doctor,
[1036.12] he was saying that dad needs 
very good care right now.
[1041.00] Everything will get very easy 
if you can stay back.
[1045.64] Afnan, I told you
[1048.00] that my manager is even on leaves, 
I cannot take an off at this time.
[1052.44] So that’s good,
[1054.40] you call at your office and tell them
[1056.56] that there is an emergency at home,
[1058.36] if the manager can take 
an off then you can too.
[1062.60] Afnan, by the way 
why are you so worried?
[1071.64] The doctor was just telling you
[1074.00] that uncle is better right now, 
let him rest.
[1084.08] There is everyone else at home too,
servants are here too.
[1092.08] Please don’t worry.
[1095.40] It means that you will definitely 
go to the office?
[1097.80] Afnan, try to understand me.
[1103.76] Why are you acting stubborn like a kid?
[1106.00] I am helpless.
[1108.56] You are helpless.
[1116.80] I should understand your problem,
[1119.52] but you won’t.
[1124.08] Umm, okay don’t be upset.
[1132.00] Okay listen, call me if there is 
anything and I will come.
[1135.84] I am getting very late,
[1137.68] I will try to come early in the evening.
[1140.52] Take care.
[1228.28] Greetings dad.
[1230.16] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[1234.44] How are you feeling now?
[1240.28] Yes, I am fine, thank God,
[1242.36] I just feel heavy at heart sometimes
[1244.48] so then I feel difficulty in breathing,
other than that I am fine.
[1247.52] okay, by the way, I was just speaking
to your doctor right now,
[1254.92] he was complaining about you that 
you are not taking medicines in time.
[1266.84] In fact, I feel that you are not taking 
medicine at all that is why you got unwell.
[1280.56] Hey Afnan, doctor these days are not
even secret sharers anymore,
[1296.76] I mean he spoke to you?
[1298.72] Look I am fed up of taking 
these medicines,
[1301.36] I cannot take them anymore,
[1303.40] and whatever God wills 
will happen anyway,
[1305.40] I cannot take the medicines.
[1307.12] But this is not a solution dad,
[1309.52] if you wouldn’t take medicines then…
[1311.28] Sir, I have served the food, 
come everyone.
[1313.92] Okay you may go. Okay listen,
[1317.36] what have you made for dad?
[1319.44] I didn’t make anything for dad.
[1321.16] Why?
[1322.20] Why didn’t you make something?
[1324.08] Can’t you see dad is so unwell?
[1326.00] You think he will eat normal food at home?
[1327.80] Make diet food for him, go.
[1330.24] Tabassum,
[1331.80] there is no need to make that
tasteless non spicy soup.
[1336.28] I will eat whatever is cooked 
at home, okay?
[1338.44] There is a limit, dad.
[1339.88] Okay.
[1340.76] You have got so unwell by not being
careful with what you eat,
[1343.48] doctor has given me such a long lecture.
[1345.12] You won’t eat home cooked food,
you will have soup, that’s it.
[1348.16] Uncle, listen to me,
[1350.16] I will make a delicious soup for you.
[1362.16] Whenever mom and dad used 
to get unwell,
[1364.08] I used to make soup for them,
I make very good soup,
[1366.60] if you want, I can make chicken 
corn soup for you
[1369.12] or I can even make vegetable soup 
it will have everything carrots,
[1371.60] capsicum, peas, corns etc,
[1374.24] it will be very yummy, trust me, 
it won’t be saltless at all.
[1378.80] Oh, that even sounds yummy,
[1380.76] it will be great if you make it, 
I will have that, okay.
[1383.68] okay I will bring it for you.
[1401.52] Alizeh? 
hmm?
[1403.12] I actually wanted to say that how 
about you don’t go to the office today?
[1407.16] I was just talking to the doctor,
[1409.12] he was saying that dad needs 
very good care right now.
[1413.88] Everything will get very easy 
if you can stay back.
[1417.16] Afnan, I told you that my manager
is even on leaves,
[1421.12] I cannot take an off at this time.
[1423.80] So that’s good,
[1425.84] you call at your office and tell them
[1427.48] that there is an emergency at home,
[1429.48] if the manager can take an off 
then you can too.
[1433.84] Afnan, by the way 
why are you so worried?
[1436.84] The doctor was just telling you
[1438.88] that uncle is better right now, 
let him rest.
[1442.04] There is everyone else at home too, 
servants are here too.
[1445.52] Please don’t worry.
[1449.00] It means that you will definitely 
go to the office?
[1451.12] Okay listen, call me if there is 
anything and I will come.
[1454.84] I am getting very late,
[1456.76] I will try to come early in the evening.
[1459.56] Take care.
[1461.68] Dad, by the way it’s so sad,
[1468.28] I insisted so much but 
you didn’t listen to me
[1471.36] and she said it for once 
and you agreed.
[1478.44] This girl has been sitting with me 
by my side since morning.
[1489.72] If God has blessed me with a daughter,
[1491.96] she would be taking care of me like this,
[1503.40] indeed, daughters are a blessing 
from God.
[1506.52] Okay now you sit down,
why do you worry?
[1509.00] I am fine.
[1514.36] Yes, so I was telling her,
[1517.76] let me tell you as well.
[1569.36] Afnan, you know when after childhood 
and adolescence a person steps into old age,
[1576.08] he doesn’t need anything, 
you must have seen that
[1579.64] he just asks for some attention, 
he wants that
[1583.20] people who live around him 
spend some time with him,
[1587.52] he wants to see his kids around him,
kids of his kids,
[1591.88] when God will bless you with a child,
[1594.28] you will see I will be roaming around 
with them,
[1596.08] I will make them sit on my shoulders,
I will play with them,
[1598.52] a person gets a different energy 
when he becomes a grandfather, yeah.
[1602.12] Uncle, soup.
[1603.40] Give it to me, I will feed him.
[1604.88] Let it be, I will have it myself.
[1606.88] I will have it myself. Give it to me.
[1608.20] But dad.
[1615.84] In The name of God, 
the most gracious and merciful.
[1620.56] Mmm,
[1623.56] wow,
[1625.00] you have made such tasty soup.
[1626.52] My child, when I get unwell again,
[1629.08] make the same soup for me.
[1634.16] Uncle, God forbid, you get unwell again.
[1642.68] And you don’t have to get unwell 
to have this soup,
[1645.92] whenever you will ask me, 
I will make this soup for you.
[1648.04] I have to get unwell to 
have such nice soup.
[1652.56] Greetings uncle.
[1654.08] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[1657.20] How are you now?
[1658.48] I am fine, by the grace of God, 
how are you?
[1670.84] Alizeh, my child, do one thing, 
learn the recipe of this soup from Ramsha,
[1685.88] if she is not there some time,
[1687.32] you make this soup for me.
[1712.52] it is amazing.
[1714.60] I will be right back.
[1755.84] Afnan, at least you could have called me
and told me uncle is absolutely fine,
[1760.00] I came so early from work,
[1762.60] I could have finished my work, at least.
[1767.52] Unbelievable,
[1772.52] you still care about your work,
[1775.12] you are concerned about your work?
[1777.80] Why is your mood off?
[1784.92] Uncle is absolutely fine,
[1786.60] he is eating, drinking, he is happy.
[1794.12] What else does he need?
[1795.64] he needs our attention,
[1801.64] the sad part is you are unable
to understand this.
[1807.00] Why are you being worried like 
uncle has been unwell for ages?
[1814.12] I am not as upset about dad’s health
[1820.36] as much as I am hurt by your behavior.
[1825.72] Please Afnan, stop talking nonsense,
[1828.44] I was worried for him that is why
I came early.
[1830.88] Yes, I can clearly see
[1833.24] how much you were worried for him.
[1837.56] Afnan, actually, there are some people,
[1839.72] no matter what we do for them,
[1842.00] they are never happy, 
you are one of them.
[1907.72] Afnan?
[1913.64] Don’t you have to sleep?
[1920.36] You have been sitting here 
since morning, you must be tired,
[1922.80] go and rest for a while.
[1924.56] No, you go to sleep.
[1931.28] Dad is not well, 
he has a temperature,
[1934.48] I will sit here tonight.
[1942.40] Uncle has fever?
[1945.00] When did he have fever?
[1949.68] What do you mean by when?
[1952.68] What do you want?
[1954.36] Do you want me to give you 
a report of every second here?
[1957.32] That at xyz time dad had a temperature.
[1960.84] That is not what I meant, Afnan,
[1963.16] why are you being so cranky,
[1965.36] I was just asking,
[1968.08] you sat here all day,
[1969.84] you must be tired, go and 
rest for a while.
[1971.84] No, I am absolutely fine.
[1974.44] Who will take care of uncle 
if you get unwell?
[1978.72] Okay listen, you go and 
rest for a while,
[1982.04] I will sit with uncle.
[1984.40] Are you sure you will sit?
[1985.96] Yes, it’s not a problem.
[1989.28] Okay.
[1991.08] Great because I have to meet 
Dr Peerzada,
[1995.12] he is weird,
[1997.12] I have been calling him for so long,
he is not attending,
[2000.04] I will go check at the hospital.
[2001.48] Yes, don’t worry, I am here. 
Okay.
[2052.28] How is uncle? 
Did he wake up?
[2056.52] He has fever,
[2058.60] Afnan has gone to talk to the doctor.
[2066.76] Umm, Ramsha,
[2069.92] can you sit with uncle for a while?
[2072.52] Actually, I am very tired, 
I just came back from the office
[2075.08] and Afnan made me sit here
 and went.
[2077.44] Please, will you sit here 
if there is no problem?
[2085.32] Listen,
[2087.24] whenever Afnan comes, tell him
that I just left from here.
[2091.08] Do you understand
what I am saying?
[2093.40] Hmm.
[2095.00] Thank you so much. Sit.
[2190.96] Afnan?
[2192.56] Afnan? Afnan, 
quickly open the door.
[2199.40] Quickly open Afnan.
[2203.76] What happened?
[2204.72] Uncle’s condition has gone really bad,
quickly come.
[2207.20] What?
[2233.24] Doctor?
[2234.84] Doctor, what happened to dad?
[2255.16] Doctor, why aren’t you telling anything?
[2256.76] What happened to my dad? 
Tell me something, please.
