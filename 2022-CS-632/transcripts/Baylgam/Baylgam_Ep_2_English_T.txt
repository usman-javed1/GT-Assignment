[19.08] Alizey, how was your meeting?
[21.44] Uncle, it went very good,
[24.60] I got way more appreciation 
than I expected.
[29.08] Mom, my boss is so proud of me.
[31.80] Do you remember Mr Ashar?
[33.48] He even wants to come 
and meet you all.
[35.80] I told him about you all 
so he wants to come home.
[40.56] So then, my child, call him 
for dinner some day.
[44.00] Hey? No no dad,
[46.56] what is wrong with you?
[47.84] Why would we call any stranger 
at our home like this?
[50.44] Why?
[51.68] If he wants to come, let him,
[53.96] and guests are a source of blessing 
anyway.
[59.00] Brother, the family is very good,
[61.32] I have met his mother at 
Alizey’s promotion party.
[65.88] She is a very nice lady.
[69.24] Really aunt?
[70.76] By the way, aunt I guess you don’t know,
[73.56] the world has gotten very clever,
[75.56] people seem to be different than 
they actually are.
[79.28] Who is what, only God knows all that,
brother.
[83.00] We have no idea, 
we judge by what we see
[84.80] but we should always think positive 
and keep good hopes.
[89.64] A Muslim should have good hopes in 
another Muslim, that’s what we are ordered.
[98.20] Dad,
[99.68] you are absolutely right
[101.08] but you are talking with your
 own point of view,
[103.72] you don’t see bad in anyone at all,
[106.36] that is why people take advantage
from you.
[111.52] You are night Afnan,
[113.84] your late uncle would say the same.
[116.48] He used to say that
[118.16] brother has a very soft heart
[120.12] and due to this softness everyone
takes advantage of him.
[124.00] Afsheen, everything will be left here,
[127.36] we won’t take anything with us,
[130.20] only our deeds will accompany us.
[133.08] And we are ordered to be kind.
[136.32] Kindness develops fear of God in you,
[140.24] it brings you closer to God.
[143.24] Hmm,
[144.44] uncle you are absolutely right,
 I am with you.
[150.72] Stay blessed.
[163.72] You will go to meet Afnan?
[166.24] What if everyone finds out at home?
[169.56] And if brother finds out,
[171.72] there will be a lot of drama.
[178.44] You think I am a fool like you?
[181.04] That I will inform family before 
going anywhere or any of my plan?
[185.40] Am I a fool?
[188.20] I won’t tell anything to anyone
[190.56] so no one would know anything.
[194.28] I have decided that I am going 
to meet Afnan tomorrow
[197.80] and no one will know anything.
[200.72] Speak slowly,
[202.24] you are not afraid of anyone.
[204.40] What if someone sees you with Afnan?
[206.84] Are you insane?
[208.20] No one will see why are you 
talking like that?
[210.32] And you know where Afnan has 
asked me to meet him,
[214.48] our family cannot even think of going there,
[217.96] let alone going there.
[220.32] Now Afnan won’t come to any ordinary place,
[223.56] he has called me to meet him 
at a 5 star restaurant,
[228.72] Ramsha, he seems like a guy
[231.08] who would manipulate girls by talking 
rich and then blackmails them
[235.92] Annie, you are so negative,
[238.92] he is not like that, he is very nice.
[242.56] I have spoken to him 
on call for hours
[245.76] and after talking to him 
I just feel like meeting him,
[249.28] I feel like seeing him,
[251.64] I just keep on listening to him 
and he sit in front of me.
[256.12] And by the way,
[257.32] I have decided that
[259.08] I am going to go meet Afnan 
tomorrow, means I will!
[262.60] What will you tell aunt?
[264.76] What would I say?
[266.80] I will say anything,
[268.48] infact, it’s Sania’s birthday tomorrow,
[271.68] remember she told me?
[273.12] So what I will do is I will tell mom 
that I am going to Sania’s birthday.
[276.04] This would be the best excuse.
[288.60] Do you remember Mr Ashar?
[290.40] He even wants to come 
and meet you all.
[292.68] I told him about you all 
so he wants to come home.
[296.68] Brother, the family is very good,
[299.12] I met his mother at 
Alizey’s promotion party.
[303.52] She is a very nice lady.
[361.60] I expected Afnan to be here 
before me
[364.44] and would be waiting for me.
[366.60] But this guy is very different 
from other boys.
[370.96] Usually boys wait for girls here,
[373.40] and he is making me wait?
[376.52] I am sure he wants to set 
an impression on me.
[382.84] Is there a possibility that 
Afnan made me a fool?
[387.24] I shouldn’t have come here at all.
[389.44] Annie was right,
[391.84] what should I do I made a mistake 
by coming here.
[394.84] I shouldn’t have come here at all.
[433.04] Ramsha.
[437.88] Afnan.
[440.96] Sit down.
[442.24] Umm hand.
[443.60] Sorry.
Please.
[525.08] Where has she been,
[526.76] I even asked her to come soon.
[528.92] Oh God! I hope we don’t get into trouble.
[531.64] Why isn’t she scared? 
I am not getting a good vibe.
[558.72] From here.
[561.04] Hey hey, what is this road that 
you are taking from?
[563.48] Umm, we are going towards 
the Clifton road.
[565.40] No why Clifton road?
[567.28] Hey, your house is there, that is why.
[570.84] Oh I am so sorry. I forgot.
[576.36] What?
[577.56] What did you forget?
[579.40] Actually I mean I don’t take this road 
to go home usually,
[582.64] I go from this other road, 
I rarely come here.
[587.16] Okay. 
That is why.
[588.48] I see. 
Yes.
[592.04] Umm,
[593.72] Ramsha, by the way I have observed 
one thing.
[595.68] Yes?
[596.84] You used to talk so much on call
[599.36] but now that we are face to face,
[601.32] you have stopped talking at all. 
Are you okay?
[604.84] no there is nothing like that.
[606.76] Actually, may I tell you something?
[610.48] You speak so nicely, 
and in such a lovely way,
[613.28] I just feel like listening to you 
while you keep talking.
[616.48] That’s so sweet of you.
[619.24] Umm,
[621.72] may I take in from here then?
[623.48] No, no, do one thing just drop me here
 at the left side,
[626.32] I will go by myself from here, 
it’s just a 2-minute walk from here.
[629.20] Hey what are you saying? 
I can’t do that.
[631.44] I will drop you home.
[633.16] No I will manage from here, 
you just carry on with your work,
[637.28] you will be bothered so that’s why
I was asking you to drop me here.
[640.80] Are you sure?
[643.16] Okay fine. 
Thank you.
[645.32] umm.
[650.28] You take care. 
You too.
[652.48] Bye. 
Bye.
[656.88] Bye.
[707.40] I even asked her not to go 
but this girl never listens to me.
[711.44] Annieee
[714.76] What? 
Annie?
[717.56] Annie, I am very happy.
[719.64] What happened?
[721.32] Annie, I have fallen in love,
[723.24] I have fallen in love with Afnan 
at first sight.
[726.36] He is so nice, so nice, so nice
that I can’t even tell you.
[730.04] When I saw him he looked 
so handsome,
[733.84] he looked so good looking,
[735.44] he was dressed so well that 
I cannot even tell you.
[738.40] What is going on?
[754.24] What is going on?
[759.68] Nothing brother, 
nothing is going on.
[768.48] I ironed your clothes and 
keep them inside.
[780.04] Annie,
[781.76] Annie, he looked so nice,
[783.88] I feels like I have fallen in love 
at first sight,
[786.52] infact I am getting crazy in love with him. 
He looked so nice.
[789.72] If brother hears you, 
we will get in trouble.
[792.20] What is wring with you?
[793.64] You are being scared like you were out 
to meet Afnan instead of me.
[796.44] Sshhh
[798.96] Ramsha, we will both get in trouble.
 Let’s go inside.
[802.08] He looked so nice, 
his dressing was so good.
[804.96] Quiet! We will get in trouble.
[811.72] Where is he lost? 
Why hasn’t he come back yet?
[813.32] He must be here anytime.
[814.80] Okay so tell me how is your work?
[817.28] Umm, office is going really well, 
by the grace of God.
[819.96] Hmm.
[820.88] he has been managing it pretty well.
[823.00] here he is.
[824.32] So?
[826.08] How are you? 
How is life?
[828.64] I am fine, brother, 
where were you lost?
[831.28] I went to meet a friend.
[834.00] Which friend?
[835.76] You don’t know him.
[838.48] Which friend is it that I don’t know?
[840.92] there are a lot of such friends
[844.12] but he came for a business meeting 
to meet me, you weren’t in the office at that time.
[847.52] They insisted a lot on having 
lunch with them,
[849.96] so I said okay,
[851.44] I will get some details 
from them there.
[852.96] Anyway, you tell me? 
what is your scene umm…
[886.96] Ramsha?
[890.88] Ummm… 
Oh God.
[892.44] Mom, I was just going to change, 
I was almost done with the video.
[896.32] do you know I have been going
crazy trying to find this dress
[899.68] and to hell with your video.
[903.12] Your craze is really bothering me now,
[905.64] I just pray to God that you don’t get 
a single like on this video.
[908.96] Oh God! What are you saying?
[910.24] I have gotten ready and 
you are telling me
[911.48] that I don’t get like on the video?
[912.76] Don’t say that mom, 
take your curse back.
[914.84] Who did you ask before 
wearing this dress?
[916.96] If it would have gotten 
even a little stained,
[919.28] Tabassum would have been so mad.
[920.72] And if she finds out that 
you have worn it,
[923.36] that will be the end.
[924.48] Who will tell her? Who will tell her?
[926.56] No one right? And you don’t worry 
so much,
[928.56] she won’t find out, I have just worn it
 for 10 minutes,
[930.64] the dress didn’t get worn out or anything.
[931.60] I am just making one more TikTok 
then I will go and change.
[933.92] You dare not. You dare not
[935.68] and don’t you even dare look at the dresses
 that come to me for stitching purposes.
[939.88] When do you listen to me?
[941.36] your mind is 24 hours occupied 
in these videos.
[944.04] I am just making one video
and leaving then.
[945.48] Enough
[946.96] I am going.
[952.64] Oh God.
[966.48] Afnan?
Hmm?
[969.44] Ashar’s family wants to come 
and meet tomorrow.
[974.52] Why?
[977.16] Ashar has proposed me
[979.64] What?
[982.16] Ashar has proposed you and 
you are telling me now?
[985.20] So? He has proposed me today only
[986.92] and you are the first person I am telling it
 to I haven’t told anyone yet.
[996.80] By the way,
[998.64] I have figured out that 
this Ashar is a complete jerk.
[1004.48] Why?
[1005.76] Why would you say that?
[1008.24] Are you jealous?
[1013.60] What?
[1015.20] I?
[1016.52] am jealous of Ashar. Why?
[1020.80] Because he has proposed to me.
[1022.60] So he hasn’t accomplished something 
huge by proposing you
[1026.40] that I had to do.
[1032.56] By the way, tell me one thing,
[1036.68] why do you think that 
I would be jealous of Ashar?
[1046.08] I was just asking you.
[1050.24] No but still,
[1051.96] you must be feeling something about it
because of which I am jealous.
[1055.20] Afnan, there is nothing
[1057.68] Hey?
It’s just random.
[1058.84] Hey Alizey, tell me? 
I want to listen.
[1086.00] Ramsha.
[1090.04] Afnan.
[1130.28] Ramsha.
[1132.52] What video are you making?
 What are you doing?
[1136.88] Where is the ohone? 
Do you see my phone anywhere?
[1139.48] No right?
[1140.28] So how will I make any video?
[1142.40] You are strange, mom, 
you have ruined my whole mood.
[1144.80] So then what were you doing, 
after all?
[1149.20] Nothing, I was just …
[1152.52] Umm mom come here,
[1154.52] come sit here. 
Here.
[1155.92] Come and sit here. 
Oh God.
[1158.52] tell me something,
[1160.16] did you and Dad had a love marriage?
[1162.84] What nonsense?
[1164.84] Does any girl ask such questions 
to their mother?
[1167.28] Aren't you ashamed?
[1168.92] tell me, it’s fine. Tell me?
[1171.32] Tell me, tell me.
[1172.76] My parents had chosen your dad for me.
[1176.40] I didn’t even see him before marriage.
[1179.52] Oh boy!
[1181.68] Had you seen him before marriage, 
you wouldn’t have to see this day today.
[1185.84] Ramsha.
[1186.68] I mean, mom, every girl wishes to get 
a good looking handsome man,
[1193.04] now no one likes a man 
with a big belly.
[1195.88] Look at dad.
[1197.52] Your dad wasn’t always like this
[1199.76] and he never had a big belly.
[1203.28] Your dad was very handsome 
before marriage.
[1206.20] Hmm, handsome yeah?
[1209.80] Tell me more, how was dad?
[1212.96] Tell me.
[1214.04] Enough enough, stop talking nonsense,
[1216.48] go and make nice tea for me.
[1219.00] And don’t make a lot of mess in the kitchen, 
Annie has just cleaned it.
[1254.28] Alizey?
[1256.20] Did Afnan say anything?
[1259.28] What will he say mom?
[1263.28] you guys are such good friends,
[1265.60] you have known each other 
since childhood
[1267.60] and you have such good understanding.
[1270.20] Even brother loves you so much.
[1273.48] Alizey, I feel that Afnan likes you.
[1281.48] Mom there is nothing like 
what you are thinking.
[1285.52] You are just self assuming all of this.
[1293.40] Alizey,
[1295.44] there is no harm if all of this happens.
[1299.92] Look my child,
[1301.80] after your dad’s death,
[1304.20] brother just didn’t give us support 
but he also gave us the best life.
[1311.44] And he never let you be 
deprive of anything,
[1315.56] nothing else will make me happier than 
you being married to Afnan.
[1322.16] You will stay in front of my eyes 
in this house.
[1326.52] Mom, this is your thinking and wish.
[1329.96] Just mine?
[1333.16] Why don’t you be vocal about 
what you think and what is your wish.
[1338.04] Why don’t you make him realize 
that you like him?
[1342.36] Why?
[1344.24] When after hearing about my proposal,
[1346.32] it didn’t make any difference to him 
then why should I say anything?
[1349.92] Mom, even I have some self respect.
[1355.64] Ashar’s family is coming tomorrow. 
You must meet them.
[1365.84] Best. Annie, keep your expressions 
on point on my lines.
[1369.64] You will say your lines after mine.
 Okay?
[1371.40] Put on the mobile. 
Give me the mobile.
[1373.12] Put it, quickly put it and yes Annie,
[1375.40] when I am saying my lines just keep 
your espressions on point,
[1379.16] your feelings should be shown properly. 
Understand?
[1381.72] I really have to explain it to you.
[1383.40] If you spoil the video then…
[1385.52] I understood, I understood, 
I used to make mistakes before,
[1387.56] you keep on taunting me for that daily.
[1390.72] Making a mistake is different
[1392.36] but how you laugh while the video 
is being made, I feel like…
[1397.96] Ummm Ramsha,
[1399.96] did you hear? It’s mom’s voce, right?
[1403.20] That’s a false alarm,
[1404.88] don’t you know your mom,
[1406.40] she takes hours when she goes 
to the market.
[1409.36] But if she sees me making the TikTok,
she won’t spare me,
[1413.08] Actually mom doesn’t like me 
making TikToks at all.
[1416.92] Actually mom doesn’t like me 
making TikToks at all.
[1420.76] Will you waste all the time talking or 
shall we even start making the video?
[1423.92] Make the video properly Annie, 
if you ruin my video…
[1428.00] go out and stand there you have to 
enter in the frame at 3 2 1 okay?
[1431.28] Come on, ready? 3 2 1…
[1443.84] Annie?
[1448.76] Get lost. You ruined 
the whole video again.
[1451.24] I didn’t. Mom did.
[1452.92] Did you see? 
Mom is calling.
[1455.64] Annie, where are you lost?
 Annie?
[1457.52] No, no, no, Annie, let’s complete 
this video and then go after that,
[1460.12] not right now, okay? 
Mom is calling.
[1461.56] Annie? 
No Ramsha,
[1462.80] mom will scold me a lot. 
Please leave my hand.
[1464.48] Get lost.
[1466.20] How will I make videos.
[1469.12] How ill I get the likes.
[1471.12] I have a lousy partner.
[1474.20] I got dressed and all.
[1476.64] Annie!!
[1478.96] It’s okay I will make it alone. It’s fine.
[1498.64] Anie, I am surprised,
[1500.48] you looked so bad in braid as well
[1502.64] even then that bald man like you?
[1505.64] By the way the way that 
bald guy was staring at you,
[1508.60] I had doubts that
[1510.28] you won’t get rid of that bald man 
that easily.
[1515.00] Please Ramsha, don’t call him bald 
again and again,
[1517.12] his name is Salim.
[1519.44] Oh ho! His name is Salim,
[1522.36] by the way when you hear that name,
it feel like some uncle would be walking in,
[1525.44] infact, it feels like a milkman.
[1533.08] Are you my friend or enemy,
[1535.36] instead of comforting me 
you are contantly taunting.
[1538.76] My love, we comfort the widows
[1541.68] and you aren’t even married 
to the bald guy yet.
[1547.00] Mom,
[1548.92] I don’t want to marry him, 
please refuse them.
[1557.76] What?
[1559.48] Why are you both looking at me?
 I haven’t said anything to her.
[1562.84] I am telling you to refuse them, 
I don’t want to marry him.
[1568.12] What nonsense?
[1570.96] He is a good educated guy, 
he is a doctor,
[1574.24] you don’t get such educated 
proposals all the time.
[1578.96] Right,
[1580.88] he has studied so much that his hair…
[1585.48] I know that
[1587.40] you are the one who taught her 
and brainwashed her.
[1590.92] No aunt,
[1592.24] I was making her understand
[1594.08] that please annie he is so educated
you must marry him.
[1598.04] Right?
[1600.68] Ramsha, you go and 
wash the dishes, come on.
[1604.00] That is how you can shut up,
go away.
[1606.16] What did I…
Go.
[1608.44] I am going.
[1611.16] Mom, I don’t want to marry him,
[1614.04] I will kill myself but 
I won’t marry him,
[1616.80] please tell them it’s a no.
[1622.04] She has done all this.
[1637.80] Brother, I have asked Aliza to give 
them our message to have dinner with us,
[1644.80] they are new people, you know 
it is a daughter’s matter,
[1651.08] I am a little nervous.
[1652.92] Why are you nervous, Afsheen?
[1655.56] Alizey is not your but my responsibility,
[1658.04] let them come,
[1659.88] we will talk and then decide what to do.
[1663.80] brother, just pray a lot for my daughter,
[1668.16] you all are always in my prayers.
[1672.32] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1674.24] Greetings. 
Come, sit Afnan
[1676.36] No aunt I am not hungry at all.
[1678.48] What happened?
[1680.56] Yes dad I have a lot fo work at office 
so that is why I will eat there.
[1685.76] Bye.
[1686.80] Bye.
[1690.96] Brother, I will be back from the kitchen,
[1693.16] these servants do not listen 
unless I scold them
[1696.40] Easy, they have some rights too.
[1704.68] Greetings.
[1707.20] Yes, Mr Imam.
[1708.84] Yes I asked you to call all the 
committee members of the mosque,
[1714.08] we will see then and decide.
[1717.04] Yes.
[1718.48] If God wills.
[1720.68] Yes.
[1721.72] In God’s hands.
[1741.48] Let me call Afnan.
[1759.60] What is it? Why don’t you pick up?
[1775.76] I haven’t spoken to him since yesterday,
he is not picking up.
[1779.64] I don’t know he might be worried.
[1790.04] Let me try again.
[1791.72] He might pick up now.
[1854.76] How do I look?
[1862.68] Horrible.
[1866.40] Have you eaten something bitter?
[1874.48] Okay did you meet Ashar’s family?
[1880.04] I didn’t and I don’t even want to,
[1883.96] in fact ask them to get lost right now.
[1888.40] Afnan, how are you talking?
[1893.40] Anyway,
[1894.60] don’t meet if you don’t want to, 
I am going.
[1896.52] They are waiting for me for so long.
[1899.76] You won’t go anywhere.
[1904.64] You won’t leave this room.
[1908.28] Afnan, leave my hand.
[1910.32] I won’t leave your hand.
[1914.44] Only I will leave this room right now,
[1916.84] I will go out and ask aunt 
to ask them to leave else,
[1923.16] or else I will have to say this to them.
[1932.16] Afnan, wait.
[1934.44] Afnan wait.
[1935.40] Afnan, listen to me, 
why are you misbehaving?
[1938.52] They are our guests,
[1940.84] Mom has invited them for dinner,
[1944.36] what are you going to do?
[1946.72] Look we cannot ask them 
to leave like this.
[1949.00] okay,
[1950.20] you and Aunt cannot so don’t do it 
but I can
[1953.16] and I am going to say No to them
[1954.88] Afnan, what is this madness?
[1957.00] What is wrong with you? 
What is this behavior?
[1961.24] Look,
[1963.04] I understand you are helpless 
and aunt too
[1966.64] but right now you just have two choices,
[1968.56] either you go yourself and 
ask them to leave
[1973.68] else I will go and tell them to leave.
[1976.72] Okay, I understand,
[1978.88] you can’t so I am going,
[1981.32] I will go and refuse them 
but don’t complain to me later.
[1984.20] Afnan, wait, why don’t you understand 
their family is sitting downstairs,
[1987.64] why do you want to embarrass me 
in front of everyone,
[1990.00] he has come here with his family 
what is wrong with you?
[1994.92] Why are you doing all this?
[1996.52] Because I love you Alizey.
[2013.44] You expressed your love very soon.
[2018.52] But nothing can be done now,
[2021.72] it’s too late.
[2050.80] What the hell?
[2053.00] My mind is already fed up 
from all the house chores
[2055.40] and then Mr Afnan is not taking my call.
[2074.36] Ramsha, make tea for me.
[2076.68] Why? Annie just made it, 
you should have had it
[2080.52] yes but I wasn’t home 
so I didn’t have it. So make it.
[2084.36] So it’s not my fault.
[2086.24] Go and ask Annie she will make it for you.
[2089.16] I don’t understand why do you refuse
 to do every work of mine?
[2092.00] Because I am not your servant 
or your wife, that’s why.
[2100.24] Why are you looking at me like this?
 I am right,
[2102.28] I am not your wife that 
I should obey to your orders.
[2106.96] Give me tea.
[2110.08] Oh God!
[2123.64] Ramsha?
[2126.16] Think before talking, 
you just say whatever you feel like.
[2136.08] Why is your mood off? 
You didn’t talk to Afnan?
[2139.64] No I didn’t.
[2140.92] he doesn’t take my call 
whenever I call him.
[2146.04] By the way its great that you came,
[2147.72] go make tea for Shani, 
he is dying to have tea,
[2151.68] before he complaints to dad about me.
[2154.32] Please now don’t start fighting
 with my brother.
[2156.44] I will go make tea 
you have sorbet meanwhile.
[2158.96] Yes, give it to me.
[2167.04] Aunt food was amazing.
[2168.88] There is a lot of taste in your hands.
[2170.36] Thank you so much.
[2172.08] By the way, I don’t cook at home
[2174.48] but when special guests come over 
I cook for them.
[2178.96] No thank you so much.
[2180.28] You guys gave us so much 
respect and love,
[2182.64] I feel my son is not becoming a son-in-law
 but a son of this house.
[2187.08] Son-in-law is a son too.
[2191.16] Come Afnan,
[2194.40] what happened, you didn’t even come 
for dinner today?
[2197.16] Was there a lot of work in office?
[2199.60] Yes I didn’t come because
[2201.68] you know it very well that 
I am very busy.
[2206.04] This is Afnan my nephew.
[2210.12] Afnan this is Ashar you must know him;
these are his parents.
[2214.88] Come sit and have tea with us.
[2216.96] Son, come sit and have tea.
[2218.68] Yes, dad just a minute.
[2220.92] You guys had dinner, right?
[2222.64] Yes, son, we did.
[2224.88] Very good.
[2226.20] So, what are you guys still doing here?
[2229.48] You guys must have been on 
your way home by now. No?
[2236.04] hey?
[2237.00] You guys got worried.
[2238.72] Don’t be so worried,
[2240.60] come let me remove all your worries.
[2243.12] The purpose you guys are here for,
[2246.36] I won’t let that happen 
at least till I am here.
[2253.60] So then don’t waste your 
and our time by sitting.
[2256.84] Afnan? 
hey?
[2259.76] Please?
[2260.76] Did I say something wrong? 
Okay let's do one thing,
[2263.32] Alizey didn’t like what I said
[2265.92] but Alizey will say this in her own words,
[2268.60] then you guys will understand, right?
[2271.96] And if you don’t then listen again,
[2275.68] just get out of my house right now.
