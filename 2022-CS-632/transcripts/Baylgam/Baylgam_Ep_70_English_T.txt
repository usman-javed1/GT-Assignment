[28.04] Mom, what happened?
[31.00] Why have you woken 
me up on a Sunday?
[34.04] I think you have lost your mind,
[36.92] you stay busy with 
your office all week,
[39.96] now do you want to spend 
the entire Sunday sleeping too?
[42.56] Care about your Husband too,
[44.88] show some care towards Afnan.
[48.56] What has happened to you 
so early in the morning?
[51.08] It is 1pm,
[52.60] if you have just woken up,
[54.08] that doesn’t mean its morning.
[59.88] Now why are you looking 
at me like this?
[62.20] I am just looking at the fact that
[63.36] I always wake up like 
this on a Sunday,
[65.52] this has been my routine forever.
[67.40] So then change your routine,
[69.20] it is nothing to be proud 
of to wake up so late.
[72.52] Do you have any idea, Alizeh,
[74.44] this routine that you are following,
[76.52] because of those actions,
[77.72] your husband can also
 get distant from you?
[82.20] Okay Mom, 
I will change and come.
[200.76] Whose call is it, my child?
[202.36] Yes? It is my friend’s call,
[205.60] I gave her clothes to
 stitch so she is calling.
[211.88] So why aren’t you attending it? 
Pick it up.
[227.08] Because she talks a lot,
[229.60] she is very talkative.
[240.12] If I pick up the call right now,
[242.20] she will keep on talking
 for very long,
[244.00] I am eating so that is why…
[246.60] By the way, I have calculated that
[248.12] your friends are as free as you are,
[251.52] they have nothing else to do,
[253.20] she has been calling 
again and again.
[277.36] My child,
[278.24] pick it up and talk to her,
[279.88] else she will keep on
 eating your brain,
[281.24] you can have food later.
[298.64] Hello?
[299.72] Hello, Sweetheart?
[302.60] hello?
[308.84] Hello? Hello?
[311.36] I think there is some 
signal issue here,
[313.56] I will go outside and talk.
[330.80] Hello,
[332.36] why have you called me?
[333.68] Oh yes, I wanted to meet you.
[339.92] Why are you doing this?
[341.12] What you are doing is wrong.
[343.92] Hey sweetheart, speak softly, softly,
[347.68] someone can hear you in your home.
[350.32] For God’s sake,
[357.60] I already lied to my family 
and came to meet you,
[359.72] I cannot do it again and again.
[365.68] For God’s sake,
 understand my problems.
[369.16] There is a price of problems, 
my love,
[372.44] in fact,
[373.96] everything has a price,
[376.20] if you give me something,
[378.96] I will give you something
 in return as well,
[388.20] this is the rule of 
a successful business.
[392.32] What do you want?
[394.52] I wanted you first,
[402.04] but okay,
[404.44] I leave you for the sake of you,
[413.48] now let’s make a deal.
[416.44] What deal?
[417.92] It’s simple,
[421.76] just give me 20 lac.
[433.28] 20 lac rupees?
[456.36] What are you thinking?
[466.32] You must think,
[468.28] you must definitely think?
[469.84] But you know about what?
[471.68] A viral girl,
[473.28] whose very ordinary news,
[474.88] a very ordinary picture,
[475.96] or a very ordinary video
[477.20] goes viral from her account
 with the hashtag,
[482.32] you will be trending then.
[496.72] Now just imagine,
[498.24] I am talking about 
an ordinary picture,
[512.44] then imagine,
[514.16] what will happen.
[525.20] Shall I tell?
[529.64] Blast.
[539.44] Look, my love,
[541.40] the more time you take to think,
[544.32] it won’t take that long for 
your pictures to go viral.
[555.88] Just a few seconds
[557.68] in just a few seconds,
[558.92] you will be the talk of 
entire social media.
[576.16] I have demanded 20 lacs,
[579.04] just 20 lacs,
[580.84] which is very less.
[590.16] It’s not a bad deal,
[592.48] think.
[600.80] You have 24 hours,
[603.92] sweetheart.
[607.88] Listen to me…
[638.68] Ramsha,
[640.20] you got busy talking, 
mom is calling you.
[646.88] What happened?
[648.48] nothing.
[650.00] Come then.
[651.40] okay sure, let’s go.
[659.48] I was looking in the room,
 your car keys are not there,
[662.00] give me the keys please?
[667.16] Afnan, I am talking to you.
[672.80] What?
[673.60] Give me your car keys.
[676.24] Where is your car?
[678.48] Driver has taken it to the mechanic,
[680.68] I don’t know what is the problem,
[681.72] it was not starting in the morning,
[682.76] I will get it by tomorrow.
[693.20] Take it.
[693.68] Thank you.
[696.84] Won’t you ask where 
do I have to go?
[701.48] No.
[703.44] Why?
[707.64] Because we ask people
 who have answers
[711.00] and who listen to you.
[713.92] If I ask you to not go,
[717.40] you won’t listen to me,
[719.76] so why should I waste
 my words on you.
[722.64] Okay keep it.
[724.92] Why? Don’t you want to go?
[727.72] No.
[732.08] Umm,
[732.60] it is Sunday today
[733.52] so I think we should 
spend time together.
[737.12] We don’t get to spend time
 together in normal days
[740.88] and I have started to feel we are 
being distant because of our busy routines.
[747.16] You think that
[748.76] this one day from your
[752.08] end will remove all the 
distances of so many days?
[754.88] It will bring us close?
[756.64] Hmm.
[757.68] Thank God, I saw you two together.
[760.12] I was looking for both of you,
[761.48] I thought you guys are not home.
[762.80] Come, let’s have tea together,
[765.12] come.
[799.32] How will I arrange such 
a huge amount?
[805.20] To stop Danish Kamal, 
I have to give ...
[810.20] ...him this money to shut him up,
[814.60] I don’t have another way except this,
[819.72] what should I do?
[822.56] Should I talk to Shani?
[827.64] No, no,
[829.32] I cannot tell Shani,
[831.28] he will create a scene,
[834.32] telling him means getting 
yourself into trouble.
[838.52] He created such a big issue 
on my relationship with Afnan,
[842.04] he will kill me if he gets to 
know about Danish Kamal.
[846.28] Oh God! Help me,
[849.20] I don’t understand what to do.
[853.24] Ramsha?
[856.00] Yes?
[856.80] What are you doing here?
[858.08] I had to come to get some 
important books so I came here.
[861.20] Okay,
[862.04] did you cook food?
[864.12] Yes.
[865.52] Okay, good,
[867.00] you can rest now,
[869.04] I will make the flatbread.
[871.36] Aunt?
[872.76] What?
[874.60] What is it?
[875.92] Where is the jewellery that 
uncle gave me?
[880.76] Jewellery? It is with me, why?
[883.24] I want it.
[888.00] I mean, I get ready in the evening,
[890.56] I will get ready and wear 
it often so it will look nice.
[894.84] Are you in your senses?
[897.00] Do you have any idea about the situation
 of the country these days?
[898.48] You will wear such
 a heavy gold set at home,
[901.80] so many women from the
 neighborhood visit us at home,
[905.28] what if someone eyes it?
[906.76] It is not good.
[908.76] And Annie told me that
[910.00] there was a robbery in the 
house that’s in front of us,
[912.36] so obviously
[913.76] someone must have
 leaked the news,
[915.96] that is why I suggest
[917.32] wearing artificial at home too,
[919.52] there is no need to take it out,
[921.60] I have kept it safely, come on.
[958.96] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[960.72] Greetings.
[961.56] Keep this, Afsheen.
[963.16] Sweets? What are these for?
[965.20] Mr. Ahmed, the member 
of our mosque committee
[967.64] has become a grandfather
 by the grace of God,
[969.16] so you distribute it 
amongst everyone.
[971.04] Okay, congratulations.
[973.24] Yes, it’s a very happy news.
[975.44] If you ask me,
[977.32] even I pray to God that
[979.32] when will we see this day,
[980.84] we even get this good news.
[983.20] You are right brother,
[985.12] even I wish to see little
 children in our home.
[989.48] Hmm,
[990.36] so it’s our age to wish that,
[992.48] Afsheen, and I feel that
[993.44] we might not get time for
 our own children but
[996.32] we feel more love towards 
the children of our children
[999.16] and I feel that
[1000.88] children are innocent,
[1002.36] they don’t judge,
[1004.32] and adults like us become 
children to in this age so
[1006.80] children spend good time 
with other children.
[1009.52] Do distribute it, yeah?
[1011.00] Okay, I will.
[1020.92] Alizeh?
[1023.08] Hmm?
[1030.24] I was thinking
[1033.32] what dad said today is absolutely right,
[1042.36] we must do this.
[1046.24] I don’t understand?
[1050.04] You actually didn’t?
[1053.52] No, I actually didn’t,
[1054.96] tell me what is it?
[1057.68] Alizeh, understand it.
[1068.84] What are you saying?
[1069.80] Tell me clearly.
[1074.36] Alizeh, I think
[1077.52] we should start our family.
[1090.68] Even dad wants the same, Alizeh,
[1093.56] aunt thinks the same
[1102.08] and I think they are absolutely right.
[1108.20] We should actually 
start our family now.
[1121.24] And I have thought a lot
[1124.04] about our relationship,
[1127.08] about whatever happened 
after marriage till now,
[1131.40] I think that the way we fight, argue,
[1134.64] and think about each other
[1137.64] is only because
[1140.52] we are unable to give time 
to anything else,
[1150.44] we just pick each other’s flaws
[1153.00] and mistrust each other.
[1156.08] I am sure
[1159.20] once we have our
 baby between us,
[1170.80] all our concerns
[1174.04] and attention will be for our baby.
[1186.40] And, now you will see that
[1190.60] how I suddenly get angry,
[1192.60] all of this will be fixed too,
[1194.36] I, I will take very good
 care of our baby,
[1197.56] and our lives will change.
[1202.84] Afnan, I…
[1205.32] I think I am not ready
 for this responsibility.
[1210.04] Alizeh, I understand 
it completely,
[1212.88] all your reservations, your fears,
[1215.40] I understand them,
[1217.36] don’t worry,
[1223.32] we won’t be like typical parents
[1224.88] that all the responsibility 
will be on you,
[1228.20] I will share your responsibility,
[1231.20] our baby will be
 my responsibility too,
[1233.44] I promise you.
[1234.72] You don’t understand what 
I am saying, Afnan,
[1237.40] not right now.
[1242.12] Then, when, Alizeh?
[1250.12] How much more time do 
you need for your career?
[1264.64] Afnan, I don’t want to argue with you.
[1275.60] And if we talk more on this topic,
[1277.88] we will argue and end up fighting.
[1286.08] That is why it is better 
we close this topic now.
[1296.20] I am not ready right now.
[1474.52] Greetings.
[1475.72] Greetings,
[1476.80] I hope you are not busy, Afnan.
[1478.20] No, no, tell me?
[1481.52] I need to talk to you Afnan.
[1483.04] Yes, say it, I am listening.
[1486.32] Can you meet me?
[1488.84] Okay, come home 
and we will meet.
[1491.12] No, no Afnan,
[1492.68] not at home,
[1493.60] I want to meet you 
somewhere outside.
[1495.92] After all, what is Ramsha?
[1499.08] I need you Afnan.
[1602.96] Ramsha, I was thinking that 
it’s such a coincidence,
[1609.84] do you remember
[1611.92] we met at the same table 
here for the first time?
[1649.88] Ramsha.
[1654.72] Afnan
[1655.84] .
[1657.64] Sit down.
[1658.92] Umm hand.
[1660.20] Sorry.
[1675.24] What happened?
[1682.88] Why are you so quiet?
[1685.20] You look worried, 
is everything okay?
[1694.40] Tell me why have you 
called me here?
[1696.56] What work do you have?
[1699.64] If I ask you for something,
[1700.92] will you be able to give it?
[1705.40] I can even give 
my life if you ask for it.
[1710.56] Just say it.
[1713.88] Your life is very valuable,
[1720.12] that is not for me.
[1723.36] The thing that does not 
belong to me, why ask for it?
[1731.96] You tell me what do you want?
[1741.52] 20 lac rupees.
[1745.48] 20 lacs?
[1749.72] Will you be able to give it?
[1753.52] Given.
[1762.16] I will just message my manager,
[1769.52] you will have this money in your 
account in the next 15 minutes.
[1780.32] What else?
[1787.16] Do you need something 
else too or that’s it?
[1792.20] Such a huge amount without 
even any question?
[1795.24] Why?
[1803.40] Because you have never asked
 me for anything before
[1817.72] and what you asked for,
 I couldn’t give it.
[1829.88] I always regret it 
and by the way,
[1838.08] you have done a lot 
of favors for me,
[1850.32] and I have to pay them 
back somehow.
[1876.36] Will you eat something?
[1878.56] Let me order something for you.
[1882.88] Thank you, Afnan.
[1886.28] You’re welcome.
[2169.04] Switch off the lights if you 
are done offering prayers.
[2183.04] Shani, who were you
 laughing and talking to?
[2187.92] It’s none of your business,
[2188.92] who was I talking to?
[2190.80] What is this question?
[2193.88] You were talking to some girl, right?
[2198.20] Ramsha, I don’t like it at all that
[2200.08] anyone asks me what and 
why was I doing anything,
[2203.16] do you understand?
[2206.36] And you should talk to another
 girl when I am here?
[2215.52] You ignore me, fight with me, 
get angry at me,
[2225.20] do I like all this?
[2226.92] Have you ever thought about this?
[2228.40] Ramsha, don’t spoil my mood,
[2230.44] accidentally I am in 
a good mood today,
[2232.16] don’t ruin it.
[2233.76] So that is what I am asking,
[2234.96] why are you in such a good mood?
[2240.08] You never get in such 
a good mood when you look at me,
[2242.16] you just fight with me all the time.
[2244.16] Do you know what?
[2245.92] The truth is, I am fed-up with you,
[2257.24] I am bored of you.
