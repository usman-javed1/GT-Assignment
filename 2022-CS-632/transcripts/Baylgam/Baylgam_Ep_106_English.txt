I don’t get it, What do I do with this boy? All his life he has done
what he wanted. He didn’t agree to anything I said. You tell me, what was the need for him to
go to Afnan’s home like this? What was the need? Call him. I will hit him two to four times,
then he will understand. Anwar, leave it. If you see him in front of you,
you will get upset further. Your blood pressure is high anyway. You know, I have scolded Shani badly and I have also apologized to
Ramsha for Shani’s behaviour. Poor Ramsha was so worried. Was this something
he should have done? He is a weird emotional boy. He doesn’t think or understand anything.
He went there for no reason. He shouldn’t have gone there
at any cost. He should remember that not only is he Ramsha’s cousin,
but he is also her ex-husband. How did he go to meet Afnan? You know, poor Ramsha was really worried,
she was crying. Anwar, she was really worried.
Now see, one mistake of this boy, one stupidity of is making everyone
suffer. Everyone is worried. And the people with Annie’s proposal
wanted to come over. Now you tell me,
we have this issue here, Ramsha is sitting at home. How do I call the people
with the proposal home? You just do one thing. You make an excuse and
avoid them. Them coming over here till
Ramsha is here is not right. Once Ramsha leaves,
we will see. Fine. These people have me worried. Alizeh, whether you accept it or not, Afnan is surely hiding something. I saw Shani leave from here,
and he was also angry. He had no colour on his face. Something is surely fishy. Mama, I too feel that
something has happened. I had to go to the office today, or else
I would have overheard something. And this Afnan won’t tell us anything. Obviously, why would he tell us? He knows if he says anything, we will say things to him instead. Mama, you call Ramsha and find out, you will surely find out something. In fact, her uncle was unwell, you ask about his health and
then try to talk further. Yes, that can be done. Annie? Annie? You know what? 
Aunt is right about you. Girls like you are trust worthy, I was mad that I came up to see if nothing wrong is happening 
to you up here, if you are crying or not, 
but it’s good that I came, at least this was an eye-opener. What are you saying, Afnan? There is nothing like this, 
you are getting it wrong, at least listen to me. 
I am getting it wrong? I, Ramsha? You are the one who doesn’t 
want to understand, I am bearing so much trouble for you, trying to make you understand 
with so much love, girls like you can never understand, you do what you feel like doing. It is my fault, it is my mistake that I thought that you will 
change your path and come back to me but no, the ones who have turned their faces, you can stop their way but cannot change their direction. Doctor, is everything okay? Is there something to worry about? No, not at all, there is nothing to worry about, thank God everything is absolutely fine. Many, many congratulations to you, she is pregnant. Though there is nothing to worry 
about but she is very weak, you have to take really
good care of her. I am prescribing some vitamins, give them to her regularly and along 
with that fresh vegetables and fruits, make sure you give them to her and then get an ultrasound 
done after 15 days. Thank You Doctor, 
I will buy the medicines. Thank you so much for giving 
such a good news, I got so worried. Let’s go, my child. Keep these reports safely too. 
Sure. What happened, Mom? 
How is Ramsha? My child, take out your shawl 
and sit comfortably. Good girl, make yourself comfortable. Mom, why are you smiling?
What did the doctor say? Sit down. You are about to be an Aunt 
by the grace of God. What? Thank God there is some god news
in this House. Many, many congratulations. Thank you, Annie. Ramsha, do one thing, call Afnan, it is a such a huge news, inform him,
 he will be very happy. Call Afnan? You know he wouldn’t pick up the call,
he is upset with me, Aunt. Why wouldn’t he? Call him. He will come running here 
when he hears this good news. But Aunt. This is the time you patch up, 
come on, call him. Give it to me, give it to me, 
I will talk to him, quickly give it to me. How will he not pick up? It’s a good news, 
he will come running. Afnan is not picking up the call. He is not picking up, right? 
I told you. Greetings, yes? Ramsha’s Aunt, Salma speaking. Yes, I recognized, tell me? Actually, I have been trying to 
contact Afnan for so long, he didn’t pick up so I thought 
he might be busy somewhere, so I thought I should call you and 
give you the good news. Good news? What good news? By the grace of God’s, along with 
being the maternal grandma, you are also about to become the paternal
grandma, Ramsha is expecting a baby. Give this message to Afnan 
on our behalf. You give him the good news yourself and tell him to have dinner
 with all of us today. Okay, greetings, Bye. Mom, what happened? 
Whose call was it? It was Ramsha’s aunt’s call. What happened you look worried? Alizeh, actually, Ramsha is pregnant. I suggest you throw him 
out of this house. I can’t do that, my hands are tied, my hands are tied to the promise Dad made me do before dying, he gave me this responsibility to take care of Ramsha always. You make Alizeh understand I cannot break the promise 
I made to Dad. Even Alizeh has nothing to do 
since Alizeh has taken an off but the difference between Ramsha 
and Alizeh is that Ramsha takes care of everyone. This is her love for all of us that she took care of Alizeh’s feelings, she cooked food that 
Alizeh felt like eating, you all should have at least 
thanked Ramsha, but no problem, I will do it, Thank you Ramsha. Here, my child, have it. Yes, yes, thank you so much. Hey what is this? 
it is a happy occasion, come on, don’t be formal 
and have sweets. Greetings. Greetings. My child, I would have liked it had you eaten 
before you leave, you always leave without having 
anything from our house. Aunt, next time, I have eaten at the office today. Okay, no problem,
maybe next time. Okay, you have to take 
very good care of Ramsha, the doctor has called her, 
and she has her check-up every 15 days because she is very weak. What if she doesn’t have a mother, but I am here, just call me once if there is anything
you need me for, and I am saying it to you as well. Come on. Shall we leave? Go bring your bag. I will bring my bag. 
Okay. What can we do now Alizeh? What had to happen, 
has already happened, we are all helpless in front of fate. Whenever there is some success
 in my life, Ramsha comes and stands 
next to me, how? How does all this happen? I don’t get it, Mom. I feel this Ramsha is definitely 
doing some black magic, else how is it possible this girl 
knows everything? Mom, I don’t feel good, I don’t understand 
what is happening. Okay, don’t worry 
you else will get unwell. Let me get unwell! I was so happy mom. I wanted to give Afnan 
the happiness of a child, but now he will also have a child from Ramsha, this girl has ruined my entire happiness. What are you saying, Alizeh? You will be the one who gives 
the first child to Afnan. And you will give the happiness
of becoming a father to Afnan, why won’t he value you? Umm, the rest, whatever is written 
in fate will happen any how. I am telling you there is definitely 
something wrong, she is definitely doing some 
black magic that is why whatever she wants, 
happens. God knows what is the truth, but I have seen that she is very 
punctual in offering prayers, she doesn’t let any prayer 
go unoffered, I guess that is why God answers 
all her prayers. Mom, I am telling you I am constantly having this doubt 
that she is definitely doing something that is why there is always some 
problem between I and Afnan. My friend Nida, the same thing was happening to her, someone had done 
black magic on her that is why she and her husband 
always used to fight. Do one thing, get this house cleaned properly, I am sure we will find some amulet. Yes, in fact, let me do one thing, I will get the house cleaned myself 
along with the maid tomorrow. We will definitely find something. Aren’t you happy? Afnan, I thought that you might 
stop being upset with me after hearing such 
a huge good news and your heart will melt for me, but I don’t see your happiness, are you actually not happy? At least say something, Afnan. What do you think I don’t find out whatever is happening
 in this house? I know it very well that 
Shani came too, why did he come? No, No Afnan, there is nothing like 
that Shani didn’t come here. Aunt was saying that uncle or 
Shani might come to pick her up, Shani might have come 
to pick her up, I didn’t see him, and he didn’t come
 in front of me. Listen to me very carefully, I don’t want to see Shani 
in this house now, else I won’t show any courtesy I don’t know what games 
are you playing, Ramsha, I just know that I am disappointed in my fate today, I trusted your fake love, I thought apparently you love me 
but all of it was a lie, a fraud, it was just the game of words, I wish your true face would have
revealed in front of me sooner, I have made a lot of mistakes. Why did you go to Afnan? I am asking you something, 
why did you go to Afnan, Shani? I went to talk to him to make 
him understand. you went to make him understand? Shani, are you out of your mind? You need to understand first and 
then make someone else understand! You are the one who needs to 
understand the most in this world. Ramsha, I cannot see you crying, you were crying last night, I felt bad so I felt going and 
talking to Afnan myself and make him understand that he should resolve whatever 
misunderstanding there is between you guys. God’s mercy is very vast 
on His men, Ramsha, a human being is not so generous. You must pray that God melts my heart for you but there is no place for you 
in my heart right now.
