Hello. Greetings. How are you? Are you fine? Really? Congratulations to you. Yes, yes, I will inform brother. Okay. You take a lot care of Ramsha. Fine. Congratulations brother, Ramsha is pregnant. Congratulations to you too. This is a good news. She was saying that I tell you 
to pray for her a lot. May God make everything better. I will pray. Why will I not pray? You do one thing, call Ramsha and congratulate her. She will like it. I am going to the mosque for prayers.
Come on, Afnan. Let’s go. This is the limit. They were getting so happy hearing 
the news about Ramsha, like happiness has come 
to their home. I will tell Alizeh to focus 
on making her family. She is a really stupid girl, who is putting her family on the line 
for her career. Mr. Asad, I will share your terms and 
conditions with dad as well, and I hope that dad too will approve it 
and we will work together soon. Thank you so much, Afnan. So, then I will wait for your answer. Alizeh. 
Yes? I was thinking that why don’t we shop for Ramsha’s future baby
 and go to their home. Afnan, there are other things to do in 
this world apart from making Ramsha happy. I am not saying this. Dad said that someone from 
our home should go. Aunt won’t go, so you and I will go. You know, uncle has the habit of giving
 everyone importance. After all, what has happened 
that all of us go to her home? What happened? Why are you 
staring at me like that? What did I say? I don’t understand why did her mother-in-law tell uncle 
about this? I mean, we have other work in 
our life apart from Ramsha. They are weird people. Come. Come, 
child. Come on. Have a seat. You came alone? Dad had specifically told me after 
hearing Ramsha’s good news, that I should surely bring 
something for her. I left the office and your home was nearby,
I thought I would come. Hey, son, you did good that you came. I will call Ramsha, when she sees all this herself, 
she will be really happy. You sit. Hello. Hello. Greetings. Greetings. Where are you? Afnan, I asked you, where are you? In the office, where else? Oh, I thought you wouldn’t have 
left home till now. Actually, I got free from the office 
before time, so I thought I would ask you. Okay, then I am going to Tania’s home, you pick me up on your way home. What will I do going home? 
You won’t be there. Fine. Bye. Okay tell me when… He is a weird man. He cuts the call without listening to me. He didn’t tell me when he will pick me. I will call him again when
 I reach Tania’s home. Driver, take me to Tania’s home. What was the need to bring 
so many things? Right now, even we have not 
even started shopping, and you brought so much. No matter how much you get 
for children, it is always less. Then dad asked me, 
and you know dad well. I have to do what he says. And I left the office, we had a 
really good baby shop next door, I went there and got all the things 
I liked. Okay child, you people sit and talk. I will go make tea and come. Hey, no need to bring tea.
I will leave. You sit, I will go make tea. No child, you people sit and talk.
 I will go and make tea. How are you? Yes, I am fine. I am happy too. Everyone really cares for me. How is uncle? He is absolutely fine. Everyone really… dad really misses you. He was saying he really wants 
to meet you, he will come in a day or two. How is Shani? Is everything fine with you? He is really good too… Greetings. Greetings. Hey, son you stood up to leave. 
I took too long to make tea. Hey aunty, there was no need for tea,
I was just leaving. No, you cannot leave without having tea.
Come on, sit down. Aunty, you are embarrassing me. I have a really important meeting, 
or else I would have surely stayed. When I come next time,
I will surely have tea. I will go now. 
Okay. Goodbye. 
Goodbye son. Take care of yourself, 
Ramsha. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Why did Afnan come here? He came to meet. Who? What do you mean who? He came to meet all of us. And uncle had sent sweets 
and some things, he brought those. So Mr. Qasim couldn’t come himself? Huh? If he had to give things, he could have come himself. 
What does he think? What is wrong, Shani? You know uncle is unwell, 
how could he come? And Afnan was saying that 
uncle has said that when he gets better, he will visit himself. Okay, and this Afnan? Why did he come alone? Could he 
not have come with his wife? And when he had come, then what was the need for him 
to come inside and what was the need for you 
to go there and sit with him? No, I was not sitting alone, 
aunt was sitting with me. Aunt went to make tea and 
I was sitting with him. Whatever it is, I don’t like him coming 
alone here at all. Do you understand? Fine, I will tell him. 
Don’t get angry. How are you? Yes, I am fine. I am happy too. Everyone really cares for me. How is Shani? Is everything fine with you? He is really good too… Ramsha is calling at this hour? Hello. Greetings. Greetings. Afnan, I… What happened Ramsha? All okay?
Why are you calling at this hour? Yes, I wanted to talk to you 
about something important. Yes, go ahead. I actually wanted to say that whenever you come next to 
our home, then please, come with Alizeh or aunt. Shani doesn’t like you coming here
 like this. Why? What happened? I just came there to give you, 
your things. Fine, after today I will not come alone. Had I known Shani has so much 
objection on me coming over, then I would never have come. But I will be careful in future. Bye. You lied to me and went to 
that girl’s home to meet her? Aren’t you ashamed Afnan? What is in her that she is not 
leaving your heart? What is wrong with you? Why do you start saying these things
 in a minute? You start putting allegations on me
and Ramsha. I am not putting allegations. 
I am speaking the truth. The truth you and her are 
not ready to accept. She acts really pure, but now when she is married, still she is not giving up her actions. That’s it. You have said enough. If someone else had put all these 
allegations apart from you, then I would have taken their life. Thank God you are standing here. My head is hurting. Shani. My head is hurting. 
My head is hurting bad. Shani, I just gave you medication, your headache will get better. 
I will massage your head. Wait. Close your eyes, try to sleep. You will be fine, just now. Ramsha. Yes. Yes. Yes. I am coming. Greetings. Greetings, child, you have not slept? Seeing your condition I feel that 
you have been awake all night. How is he doing? Shani was unwell all night long. He had such high fever. I have been 
putting cold compress all night. He was still saying he has a headache. Child that is fine, 
but you should have rested. If you don’t rest in this condition, then you will get unwell. Had I woken you people up, you people would have gotten 
disturbed too. And after all, I was with Shani. Even I couldn’t sleep seeing him
in this condition. That’s why. Okay, come on, I am going 
to make breakfast. You come on, 
Shani is sleeping right now. Okay? Come on, come child. 
Live long. You lied to me and went to 
that girl’s home to meet her? Aren’t you ashamed Afnan? What is in her that 
she is not leaving your heart? Hey, Afnan, you are having breakfast alone.
 Where is Alizeh? She is sleeping! What is this? Today is Sunday, you people should have 
breakfast together, right? You should make Alizeh 
understand this aunt. Alizeh’s behaviour has really changed. Had I woken her up for breakfast 
she would have misbehaved with me, fought with me. So I thought it is right that 
I have breakfast alone. What happened? Did you two fight? Why are you in such a bad mood? Now, this doesn’t seem like 
something new. Alizeh is always in a bad mood. You say something against 
her temperament, she cannot tolerate it. She becomes hyper. You know Alizeh since childhood. You know her temperament. Don’t do the things she doesn’t like. Aunty, you know well how much 
I care for her likes and dislikes. But her habits have become bad too. It feels like only she can put 
restrictions on me, but if I put restrictions on her, 
she cannot tolerate it. You make her understand. What do you think? 
I don’t make her understand? I make her understand and I am also trying to make you 
understand as well. You two have only been married 
for a year, Afnan and so many differences. How will things work out in future? I don’t know, aunt. You will have to ask this from Alizeh. Excuse me. What is this? Breakfast. I want to have a fried flatbread. 
Tell Ramsha to make me a fried flatbread. Where is she? Hey, she just slept. 
Let her sleep. And quit eating these fried flatbreads
 right now. What are you looking at? 
Have your breakfast. Shani, you don’t have to eat 
fried flatbreads for two to four days. The doctor has told you 
to have light food. And I will make you porridge or oats. The way you were feeling last night, your papa and I got scared. Your fever wasn’t going down. It was poor Ramsha’s courage that she sat with you all night long. She kept on cold compress on your 
forehead all night long in this condition. She sat with you all night long 
and took care of you. That is why you are sitting fine over here. Your papa and I had gone to sleep 
after giving you medication. That poor thing showed the strength. That girl stayed up because of 
you all night long. I don’t know what you are saying. Yes, how would you know. 
You had such high fever. You were suffering from high fever. But that girl sat with you all night long
because of you, even in this condition and Shani, only lucky people get such wives. Know her worth. 
Know her worth. Have your breakfast. Come Shani, move your feet. Here, I have made soup. 
Drink the soup. What is this?
Soup. Have you people gone mad? Even in the morning you people 
gave me tea and rusk, and you are feeding me soup right now.
What is wrong with you people? We want that you get fine, that is why we are feeding 
you such food. Come on. Drink the soup quickly.
Take it or else… Or else what? Or else I will turn it on your head. You are not that cruel. Look, now you are making me angry
and you know how bad my anger is. and you also know 
how stubborn I am. So you will have to drink this soup.
Come on. Mama made this tasteless soup, right? That’s why it is so tasteless. I mean, just add water to the soup, 
boil and feed it. Thank God mama didn’t become 
a doctor, or else she would have done 
her practice on us. You are so ill-mannered. What nonsense are you speaking? A mother really feels for her children. A mother really cares for her children. You don’t realize this today, but in future when you become a father, then your child would be unwell, 
you will realize what taking care of the children is like. Come on, now here you go, 
drink the soup. Drink it. I am just drinking it for you. Good. Come on. Give it. 
I am feeding you. Oh ho. Shani, finish it quickly. You are really stubborn. What had to happen, has happened, why are you blaming all of us? First of all, talk to me with respect. Right now, I am really upset. Afnan, there are other things to do in 
this world apart from making Ramsha happy. I am not saying this. Dad said that someone from 
our home should go. Aunt won’t go, so me and you will go. Aren’t you ashamed Afnan? What is in her that she is not leaving
 your heart? What is wrong with you? Why do you start saying 
these things in a minute? You start putting allegations on me
and Ramsha. I am not putting allegations.
I am speaking the truth. The truth you and her are
not ready to accept. She acts really pure, but now when she is married, still she is not giving up her actions. That’s it. You have said enough. If someone else had put all these 
allegations apart from you, then I would have taken their life. You have even stopped convincing me. You didn’t convince me even once. Shani, you have really high fever. I will go and call uncle, 
you go to the doctor. You will feel better. 
No Ramsha. Stay here with me. 
Don’t go from here. Look Shani, you have really high fever. If you don’t go to the doctor, 
you will get unwell further. How will you get better, then? Ramsha, if you go from here, 
I will feel restless. Just stay with me. What is happening to me? I am unable to focus in any work. And it is just 2 pm right now. When will it be 10 pm, it is just 2 pm right now. 
There is so much time till 10 pm. When will I go home? Greetings. Greetings. Yes, aunt is in the kitchen, 
I will just put her on the phone. Wait. I don’t want to talk to mama. I want to talk to you. Me? Why? Are you not allowed to talk to me? Can you not talk on the phone? No. No. You never called me. You just called, so I thought 
you want to talk to aunt. You are fine, right? 
You are feeling okay, right? Yes, I am fine. There was no rush at the shop today, I thought I would ask how you are. You are not fine nowadays, so I worry for you. Okay. Hello? Hello. Yes, go ahead. 
I am listening. You went quiet, so I thought 
the call got disconnected. You too became quiet. Ramsha, I… I wanted to talk to you 
about something. Yes, go ahead. I… I… I will talk to you later. Okay, goodbye. Goodbye.
