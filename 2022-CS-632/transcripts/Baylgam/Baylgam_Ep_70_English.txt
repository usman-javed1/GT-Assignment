Mom, what happened? Why have you woken 
me up on a Sunday? I think you have lost your mind, you stay busy with 
your office all week, now do you want to spend 
the entire Sunday sleeping too? Care about your Husband too, show some care towards Afnan. What has happened to you 
so early in the morning? It is 1pm, if you have just woken up, that doesn’t mean its morning. Now why are you looking 
at me like this? I am just looking at the fact that I always wake up like 
this on a Sunday, this has been my routine forever. So then change your routine, it is nothing to be proud 
of to wake up so late. Do you have any idea, Alizeh, this routine that you are following, because of those actions, your husband can also
 get distant from you? Okay Mom, 
I will change and come. Whose call is it, my child? Yes? It is my friend’s call, I gave her clothes to
 stitch so she is calling. So why aren’t you attending it? 
Pick it up. Because she talks a lot, she is very talkative. If I pick up the call right now, she will keep on talking
 for very long, I am eating so that is why… By the way, I have calculated that your friends are as free as you are, they have nothing else to do, she has been calling 
again and again. My child, pick it up and talk to her, else she will keep on
 eating your brain, you can have food later. Hello? Hello, Sweetheart? hello? Hello? Hello? I think there is some 
signal issue here, I will go outside and talk. Hello, why have you called me? Oh yes, I wanted to meet you. Why are you doing this? What you are doing is wrong. Hey sweetheart, speak softly, softly, someone can hear you in your home. For God’s sake, I already lied to my family 
and came to meet you, I cannot do it again and again. For God’s sake,
 understand my problems. There is a price of problems, 
my love, in fact, everything has a price, if you give me something, I will give you something
 in return as well, this is the rule of 
a successful business. What do you want? I wanted you first, but okay, I leave you for the sake of you, now let’s make a deal. What deal? It’s simple, just give me 20 lac. 20 lac rupees? What are you thinking? You must think, you must definitely think? But you know about what? A viral girl, whose very ordinary news, a very ordinary picture, or a very ordinary video goes viral from her account
 with the hashtag, you will be trending then. Now just imagine, I am talking about 
an ordinary picture, then imagine, what will happen. Shall I tell? Blast. Look, my love, the more time you take to think, it won’t take that long for 
your pictures to go viral. Just a few seconds in just a few seconds, you will be the talk of 
entire social media. I have demanded 20 lacs, just 20 lacs, which is very less. It’s not a bad deal, think. You have 24 hours, sweetheart. Listen to me… Ramsha, you got busy talking, 
mom is calling you. What happened? nothing. Come then. okay sure, let’s go. I was looking in the room,
 your car keys are not there, give me the keys please? Afnan, I am talking to you. What? Give me your car keys. Where is your car? Driver has taken it to the mechanic, I don’t know what is the problem, it was not starting in the morning, I will get it by tomorrow. Take it. Thank you. Won’t you ask where 
do I have to go? No. Why? Because we ask people
 who have answers and who listen to you. If I ask you to not go, you won’t listen to me, so why should I waste
 my words on you. Okay keep it. Why? Don’t you want to go? No. Umm, it is Sunday today so I think we should 
spend time together. We don’t get to spend time
 together in normal days and I have started to feel we are 
being distant because of our busy routines. You think that this one day from your end will remove all the 
distances of so many days? It will bring us close? Hmm. Thank God, I saw you two together. I was looking for both of you, I thought you guys are not home. Come, let’s have tea together, come. How will I arrange such 
a huge amount? To stop Danish Kamal, 
I have to give ... ...him this money to shut him up, I don’t have another way except this, what should I do? Should I talk to Shani? No, no, I cannot tell Shani, he will create a scene, telling him means getting 
yourself into trouble. He created such a big issue 
on my relationship with Afnan, he will kill me if he gets to 
know about Danish Kamal. Oh God! Help me, I don’t understand what to do. Ramsha? Yes? What are you doing here? I had to come to get some 
important books so I came here. Okay, did you cook food? Yes. Okay, good, you can rest now, I will make the flatbread. Aunt? What? What is it? Where is the jewellery that 
uncle gave me? Jewellery? It is with me, why? I want it. I mean, I get ready in the evening, I will get ready and wear 
it often so it will look nice. Are you in your senses? Do you have any idea about the situation
 of the country these days? You will wear such
 a heavy gold set at home, so many women from the
 neighborhood visit us at home, what if someone eyes it? It is not good. And Annie told me that there was a robbery in the 
house that’s in front of us, so obviously someone must have
 leaked the news, that is why I suggest wearing artificial at home too, there is no need to take it out, I have kept it safely, come on. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Greetings. Keep this, Afsheen. Sweets? What are these for? Mr. Ahmed, the member 
of our mosque committee has become a grandfather
 by the grace of God, so you distribute it 
amongst everyone. Okay, congratulations. Yes, it’s a very happy news. If you ask me, even I pray to God that when will we see this day, we even get this good news. You are right brother, even I wish to see little
 children in our home. Hmm, so it’s our age to wish that, Afsheen, and I feel that we might not get time for
 our own children but we feel more love towards 
the children of our children and I feel that children are innocent, they don’t judge, and adults like us become 
children to in this age so children spend good time 
with other children. Do distribute it, yeah? Okay, I will. Alizeh? Hmm? I was thinking what dad said today is absolutely right, we must do this. I don’t understand? You actually didn’t? No, I actually didn’t, tell me what is it? Alizeh, understand it. What are you saying? Tell me clearly. Alizeh, I think we should start our family. Even dad wants the same, Alizeh, aunt thinks the same and I think they are absolutely right. We should actually 
start our family now. And I have thought a lot about our relationship, about whatever happened 
after marriage till now, I think that the way we fight, argue, and think about each other is only because we are unable to give time 
to anything else, we just pick each other’s flaws and mistrust each other. I am sure once we have our
 baby between us, all our concerns and attention will be for our baby. And, now you will see that how I suddenly get angry, all of this will be fixed too, I, I will take very good
 care of our baby, and our lives will change. Afnan, I… I think I am not ready
 for this responsibility. Alizeh, I understand 
it completely, all your reservations, your fears, I understand them, don’t worry, we won’t be like typical parents that all the responsibility 
will be on you, I will share your responsibility, our baby will be
 my responsibility too, I promise you. You don’t understand what 
I am saying, Afnan, not right now. Then, when, Alizeh? How much more time do 
you need for your career? Afnan, I don’t want to argue with you. And if we talk more on this topic, we will argue and end up fighting. That is why it is better 
we close this topic now. I am not ready right now. Greetings. Greetings, I hope you are not busy, Afnan. No, no, tell me? I need to talk to you Afnan. Yes, say it, I am listening. Can you meet me? Okay, come home 
and we will meet. No, no Afnan, not at home, I want to meet you 
somewhere outside. After all, what is Ramsha? I need you Afnan. Ramsha, I was thinking that 
it’s such a coincidence, do you remember we met at the same table 
here for the first time? Ramsha. Afnan . Sit down. Umm hand. Sorry. What happened? Why are you so quiet? You look worried, 
is everything okay? Tell me why have you 
called me here? What work do you have? If I ask you for something, will you be able to give it? I can even give 
my life if you ask for it. Just say it. Your life is very valuable, that is not for me. The thing that does not 
belong to me, why ask for it? You tell me what do you want? 20 lac rupees. 20 lacs? Will you be able to give it? Given. I will just message my manager, you will have this money in your 
account in the next 15 minutes. What else? Do you need something 
else too or that’s it? Such a huge amount without 
even any question? Why? Because you have never asked
 me for anything before and what you asked for,
 I couldn’t give it. I always regret it 
and by the way, you have done a lot 
of favors for me, and I have to pay them 
back somehow. Will you eat something? Let me order something for you. Thank you, Afnan. You’re welcome. Switch off the lights if you 
are done offering prayers. Shani, who were you
 laughing and talking to? It’s none of your business, who was I talking to? What is this question? You were talking to some girl, right? Ramsha, I don’t like it at all that anyone asks me what and 
why was I doing anything, do you understand? And you should talk to another
 girl when I am here? You ignore me, fight with me, 
get angry at me, do I like all this? Have you ever thought about this? Ramsha, don’t spoil my mood, accidentally I am in 
a good mood today, don’t ruin it. So that is what I am asking, why are you in such a good mood? You never get in such 
a good mood when you look at me, you just fight with me all the time. Do you know what? The truth is, I am fed-up with you, I am bored of you.
