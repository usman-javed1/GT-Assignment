Alizay. What happened? Why didn’t you 
go to the office today? I went to the office. 
It started drizzling outside, so I came back. You know 
the situation the road gets into. Hey, when did it start raining? The sun was shining a little while back. It is Karachi’s weather. 
Very unpredictable. Yes. Alizay, shall we go?
Where? Outside? Yes. No, Afnan, you know I don’t like getting
 drenched in the rain. Oh come on, Alizay, this is the first rain of the season. There is no beautiful rain than this. It has its own fun to get drenched in it, 
like Ramsha says…. Who, Ramsha? Ramsha is an employee in my office,
 newly hired. She was saying it one day, 
so the thought came to my head. But leave her, come on, you and I will go 
enjoy the rain. Come on. You leave this. Come on, 
lets make coffee and go to the terrace to 
enjoy the weather. You are saying such tasteless things, and you want to leave it and 
worry about food and drinks. What is wrong, Afnan? Look, if you want to live your life with me, then get used to listening to me. I want to live my life with you, 
that is why I gave this heart to you. I have to listen to your orders all my life. So get used to it from now on. Shall we go? Let’s prepare coffee. Man. Come on. Come. Water. Oh man, I just had to run out of water. What happened? 
Do you want something? Me? You. Have you gone mad? Are you in your senses? What did you say? You know, I realized something today. You are beautiful, but when your hair is wet, you look even better. Stop your nonsense here, Shani. Ill-mannered man, cheapster, get out of my way. He has no shame. He is a complete… What? What is your problem? My problem? My problem is that as much as 
I dislike you, I like you equally. Shani, get lost from here in two minutes or else I will teach you a lesson 
that you will never forget. What will you do? What will you do? Have you gone mad? I am telling you, leave me 
or else I will do something that you will remember all your life.
What will you do? You don’t agree? You don’t understand? 
You wont leave me? This is the answer for 
this question of yours. I did run from the home,
 I made a mistake, I didn’t commit a sin. 
Understand? Get lost from here. You wont agree like this. 
You are worth pushing out. Get lost from here. You can fool those outside, 
but not me. Do you understand?
Leave me. Leave me, Shani. 
Leave me. Mama. 
Mama. Mama. 
Mama. What happened?
Ramsha. What happened, Ramsha? What happened child? 
What has happened? Mama.
What happened? Mama, Shani. Shani. Mama. Mama, she is lying. Earlier daughters used to be 
unsafe outside the home, now will daughters be unsafe 
in their own homes like this? Salma, if a person cannot trust their own,
then who will they trust? Shameless. Disrespectful. Did you not have shame? You trampled the respect 
of your mother’s family. Mehnaz. Mehnaz. Bring me a glass of water. Okay, that’s it, child. Mama.
Okay my love, stop crying. You are tiring yourself for no reason. Mama. What happened? Papa. Papa. Papa. What happened, child? 
Why are you crying? Papa. Hey, tell me something. Will someone tell me what happened? Yes, that… Ramsha’s friend who got shot, she was telling me her story. She got emotional hearing the story,
that is why she is crying. Okay child, what had to happen,
had happened. Pray for her that God forgives her. What happened?
Why are you crying, child? Okay Ramsha, my love, go to your room. Go and wash your hands and face.
I will come. Come on, go. If you talk about the past in front of 
her again and again, then she will feel hurt. You should be careful. Sure. Yes, you have a seat. 
I will serve food. Serve food later. First give me water. Sure. Sure. I will just bring it. Get lost from here in two minutes or else I will teach you a lesson 
that you will never forget. What will you do? What will you do? Have you gone mad? I am telling you, leave me 
or else I will do something that you will remember all your life.
What will you do? You don’t agree? You don’t understand? 
You wont leave me? This is the answer for 
this question of yours. I did run from the home, 
I made a mistake, I didn’t commit a sin.
 Understand? Get lost from here. You wont agree like this. 
You are worth pushing out. Get lost from here. You can fool those outside, 
but not me. Do you understand? Hey, tell me something. Will someone tell me what happened? Yes, that… Ramsha’s friend who got shot, she was telling me her story. She got emotional hearing the story, 
that is why she is crying. Okay child, what had to happen,
had happened. Pray for her that God forgives her. What happened? 
Why are you crying, child? Okay Ramsha, my love, 
go to your room. Go and wash your hands and face. 
I will come. Come on, go. Mama, did something happen at home? Why? Did you talk to someone? No, there is a sudden silence at home, and Ramsha and elder mama didn’t 
come for breakfast, so I thought. Did you say something to elder mama? Mama, now what Ramsha had to do,
she did it. What had to happen, has happened. Taunting elder mama on the same thing
or insulting her is not right. What fault does that poor thing 
have in this? Greetings. Bring my tea in my room. Did something happen, brother? I will go give mama her tea. Mama. Mama, she is lying. Earlier daughters used to be 
unsafe outside the home, now will daughters be unsafe 
in their own homes like this? Salma, if a person cannot trust their own,
then who will they trust? Shameless. Disrespectful. Did you not have shame? You trampled the respect of 
your mother’s family. What was left lacking 
in your upbringing? Speak up. Tell me, you shameless man. Why have you come here? I don’t even want to see your face. 
Go from here. Mama, I know you are upset with me, and I have hurt your heart. Whatever I did was wrong, but believe me, mama, it was not all my fault. 
You know Ramsha well. You know her actions. She is the one who misled me 
or else I cannot even think that. If your own sister was 
in Ramsha’s place, then? Mama, what nonsense are you speaking? I am speaking the same thing 
you cannot tolerate. If someone has a bad character, then it in no way means it is allowed 
for you to commit a sin. Why did you forget that you will only be questioned 
about your actions, not for someone else’s actions. What about the one who instigates you
to commit a sin? Fear God. Instead of seeking forgiveness 
on your sin, you are still giving justifications? This is the clear difference 
between a man and the satan that the man seeks 
forgiveness for their sins. May God the capability to truly 
seek forgiveness on your sins, so that sister in law and 
Ramsha forgive you. I too am the mother of a daughter, and I can feel the intensity of their pain 
in my veins. Mama, please. Mama, please try and understand. Mama, please take my phone but at least 
let me complete my studies. Mama, I wont use my mobile, 
I have to study. Please. Please, let me complete my studies. Shush. That is fine, but where was Ramsha for so many days. I had come a couple of times earlier too,
 but she… I had told you earlier, Ramsha had gone to visit her aunt 
in Nawabshah. Really? But people are saying different things. Anyway, I don’t care about 
what people say. The more the people, 
the greater the gossip. Why do you care about people? 
People say all sorts of things. People make a mountain 
out of a mole hill. There is nothing and 
they say useless things. Anyway, you leave all this, you tell us a good proposal for our Ramsha. Ramsha’s father wants that 
we marry her as soon as possible. You know Ramsha’s father is not well. He already had diabetes and 
now he also has a heart problem. The sooner you fulfill the responsibility 
of a daughter, the better. After all, you shouldn’t delay marrying off
your grown up child. Look Mehnaz, I will not keep 
anything hidden. We will surely have problems with regards
to Ramsha’s wedding. Because where is doubt in the hearts 
of people with regards to the girl’s character, there it is really difficult 
to find good proposals. Anyway, you don’t worry. If I see a good and suitable proposal, I will surely tell you. I have a proposal, if you agree, then 
I will take things forward. Yes, yes, why not? 
Do talk to them. But be careful, that the people should be simple 
and decent. Look, I will tell you something, the boy’s age is a little older, 
but he has a good job. He is a supervisor in a garment factory. Okay, how old is he? He must be at least between 
forty five to fifty years of age. But look, I will not lie at all. He was married earlier, 
but he has divorced his wife. Look, he even had two children, but his wife took them with her. Our Ramsha will have no issues. Are you in your senses? What are you saying? You are suggesting a proposal for a 
forty five year old man, for my young daughter. No, we don’t accept. You leave it. If you have a good proposal as per 
her age, then please tell me. Look Mehnaz, I am in no hurry, you think and let me know. 
I will leave now. Goodbye. Is this the same Ramsha, 
who wouldn’t stop laughing? Whose laughter would echo in this home? It is like she has forgotten to laugh now. Ramsha. Tea.
Thank you so much. Thank you. Are you feeling okay? Yes. Why? What happened? I am surprised. Today you said thank you 
on giving you a cup of tea. In all these years you didn’t thank me once. How did you thank me today? 
You are being formal with me today? I am not being formal, 
I am caring about it. Even if late, but I have realized it. Our real life is around our own. The ones we ignore. Really? You have started to say such big things. Annie. What are you doing here? Come on, go to your room and study. Sure. Stay away from my sister. I am scared that she might become like you. You are lying, to yourself and me too. You know well what you are afraid of. You are afraid that if I sit with Annie and 
I tell her your reality, then she too will hate you 
like I hate you, and she will never see 
your filthy face. You are afraid of this, right? Ramsha.
Yes, mama? Talk to the boy you liked and tell him to send his family 
for your proposal. If we like his family, then I promise you, your father 
will not have an objection. Here you go. Mama. Mama, Afnan is really good and his family is really good too. His family business has a big name. I am sure, papa would surely know them. When you meet Afnan. 
You will be happy to meet him That’s it. How good they are or how bad they are, me and your father will decide this. You just call his family. Oh God, thank you so much. I didn’t even think you will ease it 
for me like this. Thank you God that You did something so big for me,
so easily. God, thank you so much. Hello. Greetings Afnan. 
Where are you? You know, there is something. At times you ask questions, 
like a wife would question her husband. I am going for a meeting. 
You tell me. Arrange a meeting with me too. I have to talk to you about 
something important and one thing out of it 
is really important. Yes, so tell me right now, 
I am listening. No. No, Afnan, I cannot do it 
on the call like this. I want to talk to you about it 
by meeting you. Okay fine, but I am a little busy nowadays, so we will meet after two to three days. Afnan, you don’t understand me. I want to talk to you about 
something really important. This thing is even more important 
than all your work. You please meet me. Okay, I will do something, okay? Fine, I will wait for you. Okay. Bye. Annie, please, agree for the last time. Now even mama has agreed. Once I meet Afnan, after that mama 
will talk to papa and convince him. Just support me one last time. Then what is the issue? 
Call Afnan home. Make him talk to elder mama
and elder papa. Have you gone mad?
 Let me meet him myself first. Once I meet him and talk to him, 
then only can I invite him over to the home. By the way, tell me the truth, Ramsha, does Afnan really love you? Do you have a doubt? All that he has done for me, there is no room for doubt, Annie. Yes, that is true. You know what love is? Giving respect to the person you like. Giving them respect, supporting them, listening to them. I have learned all this from Afnan. When I was helpless in that city, I was completely alone, I had no one with me, that’s when he had come, he had supported me. And you know, I was not ready to come home. I was really scared. I didn’t want 
to come home. But he made me understand, 
he gave me the courage. He made me understand and 
sent me back, or else maybe I would have been 
going around aimlessly till today. He was worried for me. I wish you could have seen with how much love and sincerity 
he was making me understand. If you could see him, then you would have realized 
how much he loves me. You show so much acceptance 
only to the one who you truly love, someone 
who is the most special for you. Please Annie, support me once. Let me meet him once. Think about it, you won’t get a better 
brother in law than him. And whatever money you ask for, 
for the shoe hiding custom, I will get him to pay it to you. 
For sure. For sure?
For sure. You won’t learn. Thank you so much. You are my best sister. You too. Annie, my heart is beating really fast. I don’t understand how will I express 
my love to Afnan. See, my hands are already cold. Hey, when he loves you, then what is the reason to be tense? I am not tense. 
My heart is really worried. I don’t know what will happen. You know I feel really shy. How will I say this to him? I should have told him on the call. I asked him to meet me for no reason. You tell me, what should I do? Annie, what are you looking at? I am seeing the colours of happiness come
and go on your face. I want that God always 
keep you happy like this. Ameen. Ameen. You know, what is the best thing about Afnan? He is really caring. He is really loving. 
And you know, he gives so much respect, 
he talks with so much love, with so much respect. You know when I was in Islamabad,
when I was all alone, when you people were not with me,
then Afnan helped me the most, he… Okay fine. Fine. Fine. Afnan. Afnan. Afnan. I have been hearing you praise Afnan 
since morning, I am tired.
