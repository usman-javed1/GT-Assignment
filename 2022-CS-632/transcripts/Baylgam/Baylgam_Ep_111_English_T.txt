[60.80] Shahnaz.
[62.84] Shahnaz.
[64.64] Yes, madam?
[66.24] I made this juice for Ramsha, 
please make her drink it.
[69.16] But in front of your eyes.
[71.64] I have made it with a lot of love.
[73.16] You know she gets involved in work,
[75.44] then she becomes careless, 
she will forget.
[78.04] Make her drink it 
in front of your eyes.
[79.76] Yes, madam.
[129.64] Listen,
[132.08] where are you going?
[133.48] To madam Ramsha’s room.
[136.76] Are you going to give this juice?
[138.40] Yes.
[140.04] You never think of taking care of me,
[146.04] you always act good to Ramsha
 day and night.
[153.72] I too had asked you for juice, 
where is it?
[156.60] Madam Alizay, I will give this
to madam Ramsha,
[158.88] then I will make it for you too.
[161.60] Not at all. Give this to me,
[166.64] I will drink it. 
Make another one for her.
[187.08] Bashir. 
Yes, madam?
[188.28] Tell Jamshed to take out the car.
[189.76] Yes, madam.
[201.44] Mama, Ramsha has snatched 
Afnan from me.
[204.68] She has snatched my Afnan from me.
[209.36] Why are you saying these things?
[211.28] What is the matter? 
Did Afnan say something to you?
[214.64] He said nothing.
[217.40] But Afnan wants a son,
[220.32] if that Ramsha gives him a son,
[223.08] then my importance will end, mama.
[226.08] Because I will have a daughter.
[229.04] Then what will happen to me and
 my daughter, mama?
[232.24] What will I do?
[233.80] Afnan will leave me.
[235.84] I will have no importance, mama.
[237.40] My love, don’t think that.
[239.04] Nothing like that will happen.
[240.40] No matter how much I act strong, 
no matter how much I feel
[243.12] I can do everything, 
but I cannot live without Afnan.
[247.40] I cannot live without him.
[263.92] Mama.
[269.96] Mama.
[273.76] Mama.
[276.40] Mama.
[278.32] Mama.
[279.88] Alizay.
[280.68] mama, something is happening to me.
[282.60] Alizay, what happened?
[283.72] What happened, Alizay?
Ramsha.
[285.28] Yes. 
Ramsha, I have severe pain.
[287.28] Okay, get up. Get up.
[288.40] Ramsha, I…
get up. Get up.
[289.88] I cannot 
Get up. Get up. Get up.
[291.56] Come here, sit on the bed. 
What happened, Alizay? What?
[293.92] I have severe pain. 
Careful. Careful. Careful.
[296.04] Sit here. Sit here.
[297.36] Alizay, nothing will happen to you. 
You are absolutely fine, Alizay.
[300.76] Mama.
[302.36] Alizay, don’t worry. 
I will just call Afnan,
[305.04] I will call aunt. 
We will go to the hospital.
[306.92] Alizay, don’t lose hope like this, 
please.
[308.68] Nothing will happen, 
you are fine, Alizay.
[310.64] Oh God, what is happening with me?
[312.80] I am with you, Alizay.
[314.68] Nothing will happen. Don’t worry.
[316.48] I will go call aunt. 
Wait, I am coming, okay?
[319.20] Don’t worry, please.
[324.60] Mama.
[329.00] Ouch.
[334.84] Mama.
[336.44] She is really unwell, I feel we will 
have to take her to the hospital.
[338.96] Alizay, get up. Get up. 
I will die.
[341.52] Get up. Get up. Get up.
[343.56] Careful. Careful. 
Ramsha, I…
[345.04] Careful, Alizay, we are going 
to the hospital. Don’t worry.
[347.56] The driver is outside. Alizay,
 get a grip on yourself.
[349.88] Alizay.
[358.24] Ramsha.
[360.32] What happened to Alizay? 
How is she feeling now?
[362.92] I don’t know, the doctors are not 
letting me meet her.
[372.60] But seeing her, I cannot say 
she is well. Afnan,
[375.20] she was in a lot of pain.
[384.04] And I have been calling you for so long,
why don’t you pick up your call?
[386.68] I had a really important meeting.
[388.48] There were no signals there, 
so we couldn’t talk.
[391.12] I don’t know, Afnan, 
my heart is really worried.
[400.92] She was in a lot of pain, 
I feel something…
[409.28] Something is not right.
[410.68] You please ask the doctor 
what happened
[412.96] and you pray that she gets fine, Afnan.
[415.20] Don’t worry, I will talk to the doctor.
[426.96] God, give Alizay health.
[442.52] Shahnaz.
[444.64] Shahnaz.
[447.00] Madam, little madam is 
in the hospital.
[452.16] We were calling you
but you didn’t answer.
[457.64] Yes, I think the phone was on silent,
I was a little busy as well.
[461.08] What happened to Ramsha?
[463.00] Madam Ramsha is absolutely fine,
[464.76] madam Alizay got unwell suddenly.
[468.96] Madam Ramsha took her 
to the hospital.
[472.00] What?
[473.36] Alizay became unwell?
[475.32] What happened to her?
[477.52] I don’t know, 
she was suffering in pain.
[485.16] She was not well at all.
[487.36] What nonsense is this?
[489.32] How can Alizay be unwell?
[491.92] Tell me what happened to her.
[494.76] I don’t know.
[639.32] She had taken a high dose,
[641.24] because of which we couldn’t 
save her child.
[655.36] But you thank God that your 
daughter’s life has been saved.
[673.92] If she was not brought here on time,
[676.76] then it would have become really difficult
for us to save both the mother and child.
[684.60] Right now, I am prescribing 
some medication.
[687.80] Give her this medication for a week.
[745.24] What are you saying?
[762.64] Child, I didn’t know
[765.24] that you will drink that juice 
instead of Ramsha.
[775.96] Alizay, I made a big mistake.
[780.64] This is not a mistake.
[792.08] How can you call this a mistake?
[794.88] You have committed a big sin.
[813.00] You stay away from me.
[815.52] How can you do this with 
your own child, mama?
[820.40] No, child.
[825.52] I am your daughter.
[827.52] You murdered your daughter’s child.
[835.92] Why did you do all this?
[838.24] What was the need for you
 to do all this?
[840.88] Alizay, whatever I did, 
I did it in your love.
[850.76] I cannot see your tears, child.
[855.52] No.
[857.20] I felt that I will do all this and 
maybe you will come near Afnan
[863.92] and that girl would get distanced 
from Afnan.
[869.92] Whatever I did child, 
I did in your love.
[874.00] I admit, I committed a big sin.
[877.00] Forgive me. Please.
[889.72] Whatever is happening with me is right.
[901.20] This should have happened with me.
[913.32] What did I not do with Ramsha?
[927.84] This is what I did with her.
[929.96] I tried to snatch her happiness.
[943.80] And today, you see,
[945.12] my happiness were snatched 
at my mother’s hands.
[948.92] No child, don’t say that.
[956.40] What they say is right.
[959.36] Mama, whatever is happening 
with me is karma.
[973.08] Whatever I did with Ramsha, 
today the same is happening with me.
[989.28] I had considered that girl 
so wrong, mama,
[994.08] but still she was good to me.
[996.40] She took me to the hospital.
[999.60] I am alive because of her today.
[1002.24] Or else I would have died.
[1012.80] My own mother tried her best to kill me.
[1016.64] No Alizay, please. Please, child.
[1022.00] Mama, leave from here.
[1086.60] Right now I cannot even feel 
the sorrow and pain
[1092.44] you are going through right now, Alizay.
[1110.52] The sorrow of losing your child, 
as a mother.
[1127.48] No one can understand this 
more than you right now.
[1148.72] You have lost a part of you.
[1170.64] I am sure God must have thought 
of something else, that is better.
[1185.24] Right now, I want to scream and 
cry loudly, and express my sorrow, but,
[1196.76] this sorrow is there,
[1201.72] when you hold the hands of your own.
[1216.28] What is the test in which 
we have been put in.
[1229.12] I am sure, Alizay…
[1234.44] I am sure that God must have thought 
of something much better for us.
[1245.72] Today, He took away one happiness 
from us,
[1251.20] He will give us a lot of happiness 
in return.
[1254.84] No Afnan.
[1259.32] Afnan…
[1419.52] Hadi is saying that I want to go 
my elder mama.
[1424.16] Hadi is saying that his elder mama 
still hasn’t taken him in his arms.
[1431.60] I have told Hadi’s father
[1433.72] that I will rest from now on
[1435.08] and now his elder mama will 
take care of him.
[1444.60] Look at him,
[1445.76] Hadi is so restless to come to you.
[1449.24] To me?
[1451.00] What did you think?
[1452.44] If you don’t come to meet Hadi, 
then will he not come to meet you, either?
[1462.52] Look at him, 
he came to you himself.
[1465.20] Take him.
[1471.52] Hold him.
[1475.76] Me?
[1477.52] Yes.
[1480.04] Only a mother cares for their child,
[1482.96] and both of us are his mother, Alizay.
[1486.08] Just like Hadi is my son, 
he is also your son.
[1499.16] Like I am his mother,
[1501.56] you too are his mother.
[1505.16] And only a mother brings up 
their child,
[1508.92] that is why both of us will bring up
Hadi together.
[1516.92] He is also your son.
[1519.88] The same way, like he is my son.
[1523.60] From today, you are his elder mama,
[1526.96] and I am his younger mama.
[1533.96] Okay, Hadi?
[1550.00] Ramsha,
[1552.32] I am sorry, I…
[1554.32] I did really bad…
Nothing bad.
[1560.68] Don’t repeat anything 
from the past today.
[1573.72] Don’t mention any complaints 
or grievances.
[1596.16] I have no complaints 
or grievances from you.
[1598.00] Today is a day of happiness.
[1617.44] Look, Alizay,
[1619.32] the relation between us is 
that of a co-wife.
[1644.52] I admit that we can never be sisters,
[1668.52] but we can be good friend, right?
[1691.28] Alizay, is it necessary that
[1693.28] we base this relation on the basis 
of tolerance?
[1715.52] We can also fulfill it.
[1718.72] We can also fulfill this relation.
[1742.48] Fulfilling is much better than tolerating.
[1769.40] See, he is sleeping so peacefully.
