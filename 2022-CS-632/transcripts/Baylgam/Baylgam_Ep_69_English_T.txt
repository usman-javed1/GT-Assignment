[21.00] You know it very well,
 if something goes away from me,
[27.76] I start craving it more.
[37.16] And you,
[42.40] you are an addiction for me,
[46.64] addiction.
[49.32] Stay in your limits.
[51.52] I am not that Ramsha from before,
[54.76] I am not interested in 
you or your field.
[59.32] But I am interested in you,
[62.40] very much interested,
[65.12] so I want you to work,
[69.84] just for me.
[82.60] Look,
[83.84] you are wasting your life 
by living in this ordinary
[86.36] house as the wife
 of an ordinary man.
[94.52] You have made your life very cheap.
[97.48] A cheap girl is someone
[100.20] who leaves her husband
[102.40] and runs after men like you,
[105.08] fame, Money, and forbidden things.
[109.64] A good wife spends her life loyally 
with her noble husband
[116.20] but what would you know about it,
[118.88] you have never had 
a modest woman in your life.
[123.76] Whoever is habitual of eating
 forbidden things,
[127.52] wouldn’t know the deliciousness 
of what’s permissible.
[130.44] Listen?
[130.76] Ramsha, mom is calling you.
[133.84] Okay.
[135.60] Okay, is this the one?
[136.60] Yes, this is the one.
[138.04] Come have tea.
[139.36] Yes, wait a minute.
[140.24] Your papers look fine,
[142.76] here take it, they are fine.
[144.44] Dude, let’s have tea some other time,
[145.84] it is due on me,
[147.28] since I have seen the house now,
[148.08] I will keep on visiting,
[149.20] it is like my own house.
[151.48] It is good.
[152.00] No, no, no, it’s okay.
[154.48] this is fine, right?
[155.28] Yes, yes, absolutely.
[156.88] I will contact you then.
[158.36] Sure, sure.
[170.84] Enough Dad,
[172.52] enough of this workout, 
I am tired let’s just sit now.
[175.84] Good job, son,
[177.96] it is my age to get tired, 
and you are getting tired?
[180.56] What is this?
[186.12] sometimes a person makes some 
decisions that make them tired.
[197.28] Afnan, so you know that
[199.52] when a person plans something
[203.40] they feel their planning is perfect
[207.88] but the truth is perfection 
is just there,
[210.72] there is no perfection here, 
we can just try.
[215.64] He is the only infinite rest 
everyone is temporary,
[218.44] and when the result of that so-called
 plaining turns out to be zero,
[223.28] then we realize the value of it,
[226.28] it is nothing,
[227.72] we are all helpless in front of 
His planning and his decisions.
[235.80] Dad, after marrying Alizeh
[239.28] I feel that our relationship has
 imprisoned me in a room
[246.36] where there is no light, 
air that can enter.
[253.52] To be honest, dad,
[256.60] I feel suffocated.
[259.36] It feels like gradually
 I am losing patience.
[264.60] Don’t say like that, Afnan,
[266.44] don’t say like that.
[269.24] Do you know
[270.44] the devil is the biggest beneficiary 
of the fight between a husband and a wife
[275.56] and you are my son,
 I am sure
[278.72] you won’t do anything that makes 
the devil happy,
[281.48] he is the one who creates 
misunderstanding and bad thoughts.
[284.40] Come,
[285.44] let’s take another round.
[286.60] No, no, Dad.
[287.40] Come, come.
[312.20] Keep these clothes.
[315.48] Serve the breakfast.
[333.64] You are wasting your life 
by living in this ordinary ...
[336.00] ...house as the wife of 
an ordinary man.
[339.20] You have made your life very cheap.
[346.48] A cheap girl is someone
[349.24] who leaves her husband
[351.44] and runs after men like you,
[354.08] fame, money, and forbidden things.
[357.28] A good wife
[359.56] spends her life loyally 
with her noble husband
[364.64] but what would you know about it,
[367.44] you have never had a modest 
woman in your life.
[372.44] Whoever is habitual of eating
 forbidden things,
[376.08] wouldn’t know the deliciousness 
of what’s permissible.
[434.40] Hello? Who is it?
[436.28] The person who is unable 
to forget you.
[446.40] Do you know Ramsha,
[448.76] since I met you,
[451.44] I have been thinking about 
you ever since then.
[511.80] Why are you bothering me?
[513.28] Why are you troubling me?
[514.60] What is your problem?
[515.84] Sweetheart, sweetheart,
[518.48] if I just let your husband know that
[521.84] you have spent a lot of days 
in my house with me,
[534.00] so you know it better than I do
[537.20] what will happen to you?
[539.40] What rubbish?
[540.68] Are you in your senses?
[542.84] Why?
[544.56] Isn’t that true?
[547.52] Look, Danish Kamal,
[548.92] why are you bothering me?
[552.24] Why are you causing me trouble?
[558.00] When we don’t have anything 
to do with each other
[561.32] then why are you after me?
[562.40] What do you want from me?
[564.28] Yes,
[565.28] now you have come to the point.
[572.68] I want to meet you.
[577.44] When and where?
[581.84] I will call you later and let you know.
[591.60] And don’t even think about refusing,
[594.00] if you do, you know it very well, as to,
[597.68] what can happen to you,
[605.64] the next call I will dial from
 my number on your number.
[614.12] Don’t even try to block my number
 or switch off your phone,
[619.32] because if you do that,
[621.92] I will call your husband’s number then
[632.12] and you know it very well,
[634.52] what will happen to you if I do that.
[649.36] One more thing,
[652.24] don’t take me easy,
[655.04] because the person 
who can come to your house,
[659.56] won’t take very long to get to 
your room, yeah?
[668.92] Sweetheart.
[673.52] Listen to me.
[697.00] You are standing here, 
I asked you to serve me breakfast.
[743.68] I really miss Uncle,
[746.52] I am thinking to go meet him.
[749.84] Okay,
[750.80] let Shani come back,
[752.20] I will ask him to take you there.
[754.68] Not with Shani.
[761.64] I mean he comes at night,
[764.84] uncle sleeps after Isha,
[767.24] you know that, Aunt.
[775.76] It won’t look nice to 
disturb him at night.
[780.04] Okay then I will ask 
Annie to go with you.
[783.80] Annie?
[786.52] Annie?
[789.24] Annie?
[790.32] Yes, mom, I am coming.
[793.36] Yes, mom?
[796.88] My child,
[798.12] Ramsha is going to
 Mr. Qasim’s house,
[800.36] do one thing go with her.
[803.12] right now?
[805.28] Yes.
[811.88] Umm, mom, Nazia just called,
[814.08] she is coming here with her mom,
[826.28] she is coming to give an invite
 for her brother’s wedding.
[828.48] Now I said yes to her.
[834.88] If you had told me a while ago,
[836.52] I would have refused
[837.36] but it doesn’t look nice to 
refuse after calling them home.
[840.12] Okay.
[841.08] Annie, why do you worry?
[842.68] Aunt, don’t bother her,
[845.04] I will go alone,
[846.16] what’s the big deal?
[853.60] Okay, you may go
[860.88] and give my regards to brother Qasim.
[862.72] And come back soon.
[864.44] Okay.
[865.12] I will do this, go.
[966.44] How are you, sweetheart?
[972.12] I was sure that
[974.12] you would definitely come.
[975.56] Sit down.
[976.96] I haven’t seen a person as
 pathetic as you in my whole life.
[987.36] You haven’t seen 
me being pathetic yet,
[990.24] I have to show that to you.
[991.56] Sit down.
[992.56] I didn't come here to sit.
[994.40] Talk about whatever 
you wanted to say.
[996.76] I am saying that only,
 I need to show you something.
[1002.76] What?
[1003.60] How pathetic I am. Shall I?
[1007.48] I have seen that.
[1009.08] I have seen it very well.
[1011.48] No, no, you haven’t seen it yet.
[1015.92] Look at this.
[1040.48] These pictures and videos,
[1042.52] how did you get them?
[1044.04] You can’t even think
[1046.60] where do I have hidden
 cameras in my house.
[1061.92] I haven’t seen a person as 
pathetic as you in my whole life,
[1065.68] don’t you have any shame?
[1066.60] Leave my collar.
[1070.52] Leave it.
[1075.80] Sit down.
[1082.56] Next time, if you don’t listen to me,
[1086.68] your pictures will be sent
 to your husband first
[1095.84] and then in your families
[1102.24] and then
[1104.24] you know it very well
[1106.44] where will they go.
[1120.80] That’s like a good girl.
[1127.44] If you do something similar 
in a public place ever again,
[1134.16] you will get in a lot of pain.
[1145.04] Come on, tell me,
[1147.40] what will you drink?
[1155.00] Tea, coffee, or something cold?
[1158.52] Tea.
[1160.80] You know I don’t keep loans,
[1174.92] I return them with interest.
[1195.64] What a look.
[1198.16] Wait a minute.
[1398.60] What is all this?
[1400.12] Sir’s friend has gardens of fruits,
[1402.28] so he has sent fruits,
[1403.80] Sir has asked to send a few cartons
 to Madam Ramsha’s house.
[1408.08] okay, do one thing, 
keep them in my car,
[1410.08] I will drop them at Ramsha’s.
[1411.24] okay, fine.
[1447.72] My Lord, you are very merciful,
[1454.40] you forgive everyone’s mistakes,
[1458.08] oh Lord,
[1460.84] I have committed a lot of sins,
[1462.96] made a lot of mistakes,
[1467.08] if you don’t forgive me,
[1470.40] I will be ruined,
[1475.80] if you didn’t forgive me
[1478.44] and have mercy on me, so,
[1483.36] we will be amongst the ones at loss,
[1491.36] Oh  God,
[1493.24] for the sake of your Prophet
 Muhammad (PBUH) Forgive me.
[1504.92] I am a sinner,
[1506.64] I confess my sin,
[1510.16] save me from getting destroyed.
[1514.24] Save me, my Lord. Save me.
[1531.64] Ramsha,
[1534.32] you have been offering
 prayers for so long,
[1536.64] I came earlier once
[1540.92] so you were offering prayers,
[1542.48] you are still sitting on the prayer mat.
[1544.88] Did you offer prayers?
[1546.24] Yes, I just took long to pray today.
[1548.68] Did you have some work from me?
[1553.92] Ramsha? My child,
[1557.40] your eyes are red,
[1564.92] are you crying?
[1569.04] Yes, I just felt like crying
 while praying today.
[1574.56] By the way, I have noticed that
[1575.36] you offer prayers with 
a lot of interest these days
[1577.52] and pray by heart too,
[1590.36] that’s good,
[1591.80] God likes it.
[1603.76] And yes, Afnan is here.
[1612.40] Afnan?
[1613.24] Yes,
[1613.96] he is sitting in the drawing 
room downstairs,
[1623.60] Mr. Qasim has sent a few things
[1625.60] so you go sit with him,
[1627.44] I will go make tea, hmm?
[1711.48] Are you well, Ramsha?
[1715.44] Yes, I am fine.
[1719.60] You look worried.
[1723.52] Looks like you came here 
directly from office today.
[1731.00] You should go home, Alizeh 
must be waiting for you.
[1733.92] Don’t change the topic.
[1738.96] Answer my question,
[1741.12] why are you worried?
[1745.92] I am not worried, Afnan.
[1754.96] I am fine.
[1757.04] I don’t know why you feel that.
[1765.68] And it’s not necessary that 
what you feel is true.
[1780.64] I think you must leave now.
[1783.64] Ramsha, wait.
[1792.76] What were you doing in Hotel Starlight?
[1810.76] Please now don’t say 
you didn’t go there
[1825.76] because I saw you there 
with my own eyes.
[1836.64] What were you doing there and
[1838.84] why were you crying?
[1849.04] These pictures and videos,
[1851.04] how did you get them?
[1852.60] You can’t even think
[1854.92] where do I have hidden 
cameras in my house.
[1860.76] I haven’t seen a person as pathetic 
as you in my whole life,
[1864.44] don’t you have any shame?
[1865.40] Leave my collar.
[1867.28] Tell me. Answer me,
[1868.48] what were you doing there?
[1869.48] No, why should I answer you?
[1873.84] I am not obliged to answer you
[1876.92] and you don’t have any 
right to question me either.
[1885.92] We had a relationship of 
obligation and responsibility,
[1893.04] it is not there anymore.
[1973.04] What happened? 
Why haven’t you slept yet?
[1985.00] Switch off the light.
[1986.92] Why haven't you slept yet?
[1987.92] At least answer me.
[1990.40] Shani, I feel heavy that is why 
I have switched on the lights.
[1995.52] Shani, actually…
[1998.12] I know it very well that 
why aren’t you sleeping.
[2002.68] You must be missing 
one of your lovers.
[2008.08] Whatever it is,
[2009.88] switch off the lights and 
let me sleep at least.
[2054.16] Afnan, what is this?
[2055.56] You have breakfast 
alone on Sunday,
[2057.52] where is Alizeh?
[2067.84] What is it? Why are you smiling?
[2070.36] You are talking as if you don’t know 
the reason hidden behind my smile.
[2084.36] Alizeh, she is sleeping.
[2097.04] She doesn’t give me time though,
[2098.40] but she has to sleep well on Sundays.
[2105.96] I don’t know what is Alizeh doing,
[2108.16] I will have to talk to her.
[2110.16] No aunt please,
[2112.92] if you will do anything
[2114.20] she will feel I have complained
 to you about her,
[2122.88] and that will mean 
she will again argue and fight with me
[2126.76] and there will be a scene 
in the house yet again.
[2134.32] For now, I am not in the
 mental state to bear all the drama.
[2148.48] Let her be how she is.
