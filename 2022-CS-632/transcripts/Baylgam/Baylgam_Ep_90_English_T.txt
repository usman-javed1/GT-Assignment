[106.44] Hi Alizay.
Hi.
[108.20] How are you?
I am fine. You tell me.
[110.56] Did you come alone? 
Didn’t aunt Afsheen come?
[112.76] Man, mama is at home, 
I came directly from the office.
[115.44] Okay, come on, let’s go. Come.
[120.04] Ramsha.
[121.52] You know her?
[123.20] Yes. How are you?
[132.56] Ramsha, you are here?
[134.80] Do you live here?
[143.52] Yes.
[145.40] How is Adeel? 
Is he taking care of you?
[154.12] You people talk,
[155.44] I will go inform mama.
Okay.
[164.92] Ramsha, I had to give you good news.
[179.56] I am expecting.
[193.48] The reason for telling you is that
[195.60] whether Adeel cares for you or not,
[198.76] you cannot come back to our home.
[211.52] After all, you are divorced
[213.36] and even after your divorce he is taking
 so much care of you.
[216.60] He married you.
[227.92] It is also your responsibility to ensure 
that your home remains.
[241.48] Look, the relation between me and 
Afnan is going to get stronger,
[252.88] there is no place for a third person.
[256.52] You understand what I am saying, right?
[279.84] Hey, you people are still standing here?
[281.56] Come on. Come upstairs.
Yes. Okay, take care.
[321.00] Afnan, you took long to come 
from the office today.
[324.96] Yes, aunt,
[326.88] I have a lot of work in the office,
 that is why I get late.
[334.28] Yes, I can understand.
[340.44] After brother left, you have managed 
the office, home, everything well.
[358.84] Mama, I forgot to tell you. 
I met Ramsha today.
[371.04] Should I bring water?
Water…
[371.96] No, no, it is okay.
[378.08] where did you meet Ramsha?
[384.00] I went to meet my friend,
[385.88] she lives in her apartments 
with her husband.
[398.60] yes, but Afnan had said she lives
 in a neighbourhood.
[408.64] Yes, that’s what I knew about Adeel 
that he lives at such a place.
[416.68] No. No. I think she must be lying.
[427.00] She must work there, 
somewhere in an apartment.
[435.96] She spoke this lie to save her respect.
[441.80] No, mama, had I not seen her 
with my own eyes
[444.20] then I would have thought 
that she is lying.
[455.28] But, really, her entire attire 
was changed.
[459.36] She looked really different.
[466.92] She had a branded bag in her hands, 
she was wearing good shoes,
[469.40] she was looking really proper.
[481.00] I am surprised how she got 
so much money.
[494.88] I remember, her husband had 
some ordinary job.
[507.72] In fact, he was in your office, right?
[513.04] Huh? Adeel.
[515.60] No, when he got married, 
he quit the job right after that.
[533.36] And after all aunt,
[535.32] times have become so fast nowadays,
[537.36] you never know when someone’s 
condition would change.
[544.40] What can we say, no?
[546.52] Yes, you are right.
[554.20] I will have to admit one thing,
[556.44] Ramsha had really good fate.
[601.68] Afnan,
[603.36] whatever Alizay did was wrong, I know.
[606.84] I have scolded her a lot.
[612.88] And she is really embarrassed 
on what she did.
[619.80] Afnan, I know Alizay is really 
short tempered,
[623.80] but she is good at heart.
[628.92] Fine, I will go now.
[633.72] Who is that girl?
[641.12] Alizay was saying that 
you have an affair with her.
[644.84] Is this true?
[661.20] What?
[663.08] Alizay saw you?
[672.12] Ramsha…
[673.64] if you had seen Alizay earlier, 
then why did you go to her?
[680.80] What was the need for you to go,
 Ramsha?
[683.48] I didn’t see her Afnan. How was I 
to know I will see her suddenly
[687.64] and she saw me and 
she stopped me.
[692.52] A friend of her lives here.
[695.92] But I am worried that
[699.88] Alizay shouldn’t have seen you
at this time and in this condition.
[703.88] I didn’t do anything on purpose.
[712.84] I cannot even think of worrying you,
[715.92] and after all,
[717.24] Alizay seeing me here 
was a coincidence.
[728.76] She feels that 
I am married to Adeel.
[737.48] You don’t worry, 
nothing will happen.
[745.36] I…
[746.24] in fact, I will be careful 
going out again.
[751.56] You try not to step out 
for a few days.
[760.36] Look, I am not saying this with reference
 to be cruel or do injustice with you.
[770.28] I just want to say that avoid 
going out for a few days.
[780.16] I am scared that Alizay 
may have had a doubt.
[783.40] Fine, as you order. 
As you say.
[786.36] No, it is not about my order, 
understand what I am saying.
[793.52] Alizay is pregnant right now,
[795.36] the doctors have said that 
she cannot take any form of stress.
[805.64] If it was the normal circumstances,
[807.80] I wouldn’t have feared that 
you and I are married.
[819.68] But if I tell her this
 in this condition,
[822.88] and if God forbid something happens,
[831.60] we will never be able to forgive 
each other all our lives.
[840.80] You understand what I am saying, right?
[851.32] Good.
[852.60] This is the smartness 
I expected from you.
[862.84] Come on, I will go now.
Wont you stay?
[869.12] I am sorry, but,
[871.12] because of Alizay’s health, 
I will have to live there for a few days.
[894.96] Fine. Goodbye.
[936.64] I feel embarrassed looking you 
in the eyes,
[944.56] and how can I live with Alizay?
[949.56] I have no respect or place 
in her eyes.
[955.04] If I tell you the truth,
[957.76] maybe, she wants to live with me out
 of your stubbornness and not her love.
[963.84] She thinks
[967.76] if I choose you over her, 
then her ego will be hurt.
[974.88] You cannot imagine how much 
she misbehaved with me.
[979.20] I only tolerated her 
because of aunt.
[983.24] If there was someone 
else in my place,
[985.76] they would have removed her 
from their lives right there.
[1022.00] Ramsha.
[1023.60] You know her?
[1025.24] Yes. How are you?
[1032.20] Ramsha, you are here?
[1034.36] Do you live here?
[1040.08] Yes.
[1041.88] How is Adeel?
[1043.76] Is he taking care of you?
[1048.24] You people talk,
[1049.92] I will go inform mama.
Okay.
[1057.00] Ramsha, I had to give you 
good news.
[1060.40] I am expecting.
[1071.56] The reason for telling you is that
[1073.88] whether Adeel cares for you or not,
[1076.92] you cannot come back to our home.
[1084.76] After all, you are divorced
[1086.68] and even after your divorce he is taking 
so much care of you.
[1089.96] He married you.
[1093.80] It is also your responsibility to ensure 
that your home remains.
[1098.52] Look, the relation between me and 
Afnan is going to get stronger,
[1106.80] there is no place for a third person.
[1110.48] You understand what I am saying, right?
[1141.24] At times nature changes your life
[1145.36] and decisions in an instant.
[1152.56] I went to tell Alizay that 
I cannot live with her now, but…
[1162.56] but that one moment 
changed my life.
[1185.80] Maybe nature wants that 
I stay with Alizay.
[1195.92] You know well, Ramsha,
[1199.92] I really desire a child.
[1209.76] Now I cannot leave Alizay.
[1217.84] I cannot take her out of my life.
[1247.16] Oh God, what test have you put me in.
[1261.88] I will pray.
[1283.80] My Lord,
[1288.04] don’t put that burden on me, 
that I cannot lift.
[1293.68] I am really weak.
[1297.16] I don’t have the courage.
[1301.40] Without a doubt,
[1303.60] you have control over everything,
[1308.40] no one can help more than 
You in this world.
[1313.32] Help me.
[1316.72] Save me from humiliation 
and insult.
[1320.96] Help me.
[1409.24] Alizay.
[1412.72] Alizay.
[1414.16] Yes. Good morning.
[1416.00] Good morning,
 where are you going?
[1417.68] I am going to the office.
[1420.36] Office?
[1422.76] Yes.
[1423.68] Alizay, you shouldn’t go to the office
in this condition.
[1431.76] Why?
[1433.60] You are reacting like today
is my first day
[1436.40] and I am going to the office 
for the first time.
[1444.60] You know, I have been getting calls 
from the office for so long,
[1447.04] I have gotten late today.
[1448.88] Okay fine.
[1451.12] You do one thing, 
go to the office today
[1452.96] and handover all your responsibilities
to someone else
[1461.32] and tell your boss that 
you are going on leaves.
[1464.48] Why should I give an application 
for leaves?
[1468.68] Look Alizay,
[1470.64] I am telling you again and again, 
you need to care for your health.
[1481.52] You shouldn’t do such rigorous work
in this condition.
[1486.60] Afnan, I am not ill that I sit at home.
[1497.80] I am pregnant and 
pregnant women work.
[1501.40] Yes, Alizay, women work,
[1504.84] but it is your first pregnancy.
[1513.56] You don’t know your condition.
[1523.08] I will have to go to the office 
in a little while,
[1524.88] God forbid, if you get unwell, 
then what will we do?
[1537.48] You please don’t go to the office today
[1539.56] or if you are going, then listen to me,
 and get a leave and come back.
[1550.36] You are not doing this job for money,
[1552.32] that it is really necessary 
for you to do this job.
[1554.36] When did I say I am doing this 
for money, Afnan?
[1558.40] I didn’t mean that.
[1565.32] I am just telling you that
[1568.16] you please leave your job 
for the time being.
[1570.56] Just take a leave. That’s it.
[1576.68] Alizay, I am just saying all this 
because I care for you.
[1579.68] Afnan, I am really happy to hear this 
that you care for me so much.
[1583.88] But sorry, I cannot take 
a leave right now.
[1592.56] I am sorry.
[1593.80] Alizay, please.
[1599.92] You know, I have thought a lot 
about our relation.
[1605.64] Whatever happened since 
marriage till today, about that.
[1610.00] I feel that we fight, argue,
[1613.16] we think negative about each other,
[1616.20] it is only because
[1618.96] we are not able to give time 
to anything else.
[1628.88] We just point out each other’s mistakes,
[1631.36] we are misled about each other.
[1634.72] But I am sure,
[1637.68] once my child comes in between us,
[1649.16] all our worries,
[1652.60] all our attention will only be for him.
[1664.68] And you will see,
[1669.16] the way I suddenly get angry, 
it will all get fine.
[1672.88] I will take a lot of care of our child.
[1678.92] Afnan, I don’t want to argue with you.
[1683.96] And if talk on this topic more,
[1686.52] then we will argue and
then we will fight.
[1690.80] So it is better that 
we close this topic.
[1695.44] I am not ready right now.
[1714.60] What do I do?
[1720.00] Should I call Afnan or not?
[1765.28] Ramsha, how many times 
have I told you,
[1767.64] you wont call on my number, 
I will call myself.
[1771.52] Sorry Afnan, I didn’t want to call you.
[1774.96] Then what happened that
 you had to call?
[1778.40] Afnan, I am not well. 
I am really unwell.
[1783.36] What happened to you?
You are fine.
[1786.16] I don’t know I have a really high fever.
[1790.16] Okay fine. Fine, I will come.
[1794.72] Fine, you come soon.
[1796.08] You don’t worry, 
I am coming immediately.
[1797.92] Okay. Okay bye.
[1841.32] Nothing to worry about, Mr. Afnan.
[1849.72] It is seasonal fever, you just 
give her medication on time,
[1852.44] she will be fine soon.
[1859.56] Thank you, doctor. Come, 
I will see you off.
[1870.40] Ramsha.
[1872.40] Hey, I brought soup for you.
[1875.72] Hey, move this from here.
[1878.36] Mama, I had told you 
I don’t want to drink soup.
[1881.24] I don’t want to have soup.
[1882.60] Why don’t you want to have soup, 
child? You are not well.
[1885.32] You have not eaten anything.
[1886.56] You will get unwell further like this.
[1888.64] Have some soup, then 
I will bring medication for you.
[1891.08] Come on, come..
Mama,
[1892.72] neither do I want to have the medication,
nor do I want to drink or eat something.
[1896.56] You leave, please let me sleep 
for a while.
[1899.08] Hey, how can I like that? 
Did you see?
[1902.12] She is not eating or 
drinking anything.
[1903.88] Hey, when she eats or drinks something,
then I will give her, her medication.
[1906.08] Make her understand.
Hey, your mother is right.
[1909.60] If you don’t eat something, 
then how will you get fine?
[1912.20] Quickly have soup. Come on.
[1913.72] I had even told mama that 
I don’t want to have soup,
[1916.32] still she made it and brought it.
[1954.16] Stay here tonight.
[1960.92] Ramsha, I wont be able 
to stay today.
[1974.76] Alizay’s condition is not good.
[1980.36] I cannot leave her alone 
in this condition.
[1994.36] If the condition was normal, 
I would have stayed, but…
[1998.96] But what?
[2003.00] But I want that Alizay stay happy till 
the time our child doesn’t come to this world.
[2030.08] What happened? 
What are you thinking?
[2034.60] Nothing.
[2042.24] Ramsha, don’t be sad.
[2053.04] Do you not believe my love?
[2063.84] Ramsha, I love you a lot.
[2073.60] Believe me.
[2077.72] I believe your love, that is why 
I married you.
[2083.84] I wish.
[2086.88] I wish I had believed your love earlier.
[2098.60] Then we would have had 
to face all this today.
[2106.96] No problem, Afnan.
[2115.84] Maybe meeting like this was 
written in our fate.
[2123.48] You know I feel really sorry 
seeing you.
[2128.04] In fact I am more sad than sorry.
[2131.92] You didn’t care for my sister.
[2136.56] Ramsha loved you so much,
[2139.36] she was so sincere with you.
[2146.84] You didn’t believe her.
[2149.52] I know, she was naïve, 
I know she was emotional,
[2153.44] but she was mad for you.
[2163.28] Earning money in showbiz,
[2167.16] being famous was her passion,
[2171.28] but you were more than her passion.
[2180.60] Mr. Afnan,
[2182.20] every girl who lives for her wishes,
[2184.64] one who has the wish to live 
in open air is not cheap.
[2194.76] Such girls just follow 
wrong advice of people,
[2198.12] but believe me,
[2199.84] it is not impossible for them to return.
[2206.68] But we?
[2209.72] We don’t leave the door 
for them to return.
[2213.04] We don’t give them the chance
to come back,
[2220.40] and you did the same.
[2223.08] You did the same with Ramsha.
[2226.84] You didn’t understand Ramsha.
[2244.04] Okay, anyway, leave it.
[2246.84] I will make good tea for you.
[2249.48] Then you also have to take 
your medication. Okay?
[2282.24] You see yourself, 
you are alone here,
[2284.04] what could have happened with you?
[2287.68] You think yourself.
[2289.40] You were so unwell,
[2292.16] you were completely alone, 
your friend was not with you either.
[2294.56] God forbid, had something 
happened to you, then?
[2297.04] What would the family 
would have done?
[2299.96] They would have also brought me 
to the hospital,
[2302.88] you brought me here.
[2304.08] Man,
[2306.48] you know what your biggest problem is?
[2309.68] You don’t understand things.
[2311.60] Okay, don’t scold me.
[2313.88] I am so unwell and 
then you are scolding me.
[2342.16] Look, when am I telling you 
to quit your job?
[2345.40] I am just saying you take leaves 
for some time from the office.
[2350.20] Afnan, neither can I quit my job right now,
nor can I take leaves.
[2361.00] You know right now my job 
is really important.
[2364.76] And your health?
[2369.84] It is important too,
you have to take care of that.
[2374.32] What happened to me?
[2382.32] Why are you and 
mama always after me?
[2385.52] Hey man,
[2386.88] whatever we are saying is in your care.
[2393.48] Come on, Afnan. I am not a child.
[2403.08] I can take care of myself.
[2406.44] You are a child.
[2415.24] Such a child, who gets stuck
 on her insistence.
[2423.64] Who doesn’t listen to anyone 
apart from her.
[2427.08] What is wrong with you?
[2428.56] Why are you getting 
so angry nowadays?
[2430.72] When am I getting angry?
[2433.32] I am telling you to take care of yourself
[2435.20] and you are saying I am getting 
angry with you.
[2438.04] I mean, earlier you didn’t care 
for me this much.
[2448.60] Why do you have so much love 
for me suddenly?
[2459.16] Are you doing all this because 
we are going to have a child?
[2467.40] Whatever you think is right.
[2480.28] Anyway, I like you caring 
for me like this.
[2487.80] Look,
[2489.72] if you leave your office, 
I too will like it.
[2495.72] Afnan,
[2497.48] shall we talk about this later?
[2499.92] Please.
[2502.64] Fine.
[2504.24] As you wish.
[2516.00] You just came back from 
the hospital a little while back,
[2517.84] now you are going back 
to the hospital?
[2527.28] Afnan, since uncle has been 
hospitalized,
[2529.80] you are not giving me time.
[2532.56] You are so indifferent.
[2537.72] My father is fighting between life 
and death in the hospital
[2541.68] and here you are concerned 
about yourself.
[2544.20] Afnan, maybe you are forgetting,
[2546.36] uncle is admitted in the hospital
because of your beloved.
