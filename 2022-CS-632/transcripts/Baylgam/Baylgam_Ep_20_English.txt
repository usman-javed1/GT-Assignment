Get lost. Get out of here. There is no point in shedding tears, because you chose this path for yourself. 
Understand? Come on, get out. Come on, get out. Get out of here.
Aunt… Papa. Papa. Please forgive me, papa. 
I made a big mistake. In fact, not mistake, 
I committed a sin. I beg you. After today, I won’t do anything. Please forgive me. Papa. 
Nothing will happen after today. Forgive me, papa. Please, papa, forgive me. I beg you, papa. I made a mistake. Give me one chance, please. Ramsha, how dare you? You dared to come back to this home. Get out of here. Get out. You are dead for us. What are you saying? I am absolutely right, sister in law. Whatever she has done, the consequence of it is that 
we take her life standing here. Don’t say that. Uncle, you can kill me, but I will not go anywhere from here. Did you not hear what I said, Ramsha? Get out. Leave. Uncle, please… Don’t say it. Don’t call me your uncle. I am dead for you. Do you know? Because of you a scene
 was created out of us, our respect was made fun of. I don’t want that before another scene is created, Ramsha leave from here. Leave. No. Uncle. Uncle, I have no other home,
 where will I go? Did you not hear what papa said? Come on, get lost from here. No. Yes, come on, get out of here. Whatever, you have gone through, whatever pain you tolerated, no one
 has a fault in this, it is all your doing. Mama, she is really stubborn, 
she won’t understand like this. I will have to drag her out. 
Come on. For God’s sake. No. Papa…
Stop. She will not go anywhere. Brother Sajid, what are you saying? How can she live here in 
the presence of my young daughter? This girl is not worthy 
of keeping in this home. Salma, who are you to drag 
my daughter out of my home? Sister in law, 
why would we keep this girl here? She is not a girl. She is my daughter. My daughter. She agreed to her father getting
 defamed in front of the world. Fine. But I don’t accept that 
my daughter is dragged out of my home. Do you understand? Mehnaz, take her inside. Hey, you get everything without 
me asking for it. Live long. Brother did you talk to Afnan? I couldn’t talk to Afnan. Once I am done with this work,
 I will talk to him. Brother, I feel that 
we should get these two married now. Yes, so if you feel this way, 
then I have no objections. Fine. Fine, then when Afnan comes, 
you ask him and fix a date for next month. Will you women be able to make
 your preparation in a month? What preparation, brother? Both children are from our home. You were saying that 
you have to fulfill your desire. Anyway, I am happy in
 whatever you are happy with. The tea is really good. Here you go. You are not having tea? No brother, I just had tea. Elder papa didn’t do the right thing. Earlier he was saying a lot,
 he was getting really angry, but as soon as his daughter came in front of him, 
his love for his child awoke. Shani, you stay quiet. Your father has gone to talk to elder papa. So they will decide whether they have 
to keep Ramsha at the home or not. They will decide this. You stay away from this matter. Why should I stay away? Did the elders only get insulted,
 they got defamed, not me? See what you are saying. You have no idea 
what all people have said to me. Yes, so tell your father 
whatever you have to say. Don’t say it to me. After all, even I am not in favour 
of keeping that girl at home. Yes, so what is the delay for? 
Drag her out. Your father has gone to talk. 
Let him come back. Then we will know 
what decision will be made. I… brother, I want to talk to 
you about something. Go ahead. Brother, don’t mind what I say, but I feel that you are forgetting
 the defamation of this home in your daughter’s love. I don’t want to talk about this matter. Brother, maybe you have no idea 
what you are saying. I have a really good idea what I am doing and saying. Because I am Ramsha’s father, not her uncle. What? No brother, no. I didn’t expect this from you. If Ramsha was your daughter, then what would you have done, Anwar? Me? Brother if Ramsha was my daughter and had she trampled my respect like this, then I would have murdered her. I would have killed her. That’s the difference. May God never show anyone this day. Salma. 
Yes? I wanted to talk to you. Yes, go ahead. Anwar used to sit with everyone
 and have breakfast, now he is sitting in his room
 and having breakfast? Forgive me, sister, the environment of the home is not such 
that everyone can sit together. Even we can have problems 
because of your Ramsha. But you people never thought of
 anyone other than your daughter. We were the fools that we never 
differentiated between these two children. Mama, you leave it, I will make tea. You don’t need to bother at all. My hands and feet are fine,
 I will make tea myself. You are upset with me? No. I am really happy. My daughter achieved such a big feat, she has won the gold medal,
 the neighbours are praising her. Why would I be upset? 
I am really happy. I know I have given 
a lot of pain to all of you. I am really embarrassed, 
please forgive me. What difference does you
 being embarrassed matter? You know, me and your father are tired of
giving clarification and lying to the neighbours. Mama, I promise you, whatever you and papa say after today, 
however you say it, I will do it. But please,
 forgive me and give me a chance. Please. If someone breaks someone’s trust once, then they are not trusted again. Did you see? Getting angry doesn’t really make a 
difference to brother Sajid and sister in law. If it had to make a difference it 
would have happened a long time back, and you burning your blood for no reason
 and they are sitting comfortably. So what do I do? What do I do? Brother Sajid is not listening to me. At least, you make sister in law understand. There is no point in making 
sister in law understand. Thank God, Ramsha has come back home. People have shut up or else every person was asking 
how long will Ramsha stay at her aunt’s home? When will she come from her aunt’s home? You only care that you got rid of it. I have to step out. I have to live the world. 
I have to face the world. What they say, pinch me on the inside. 
On the inside! God damn it, if a girl stays out of the home one night, 
all hell breaks loose. Here, God knows 
how many nights she spent outside. And what sort of parents are they, 
it makes no difference to them. Okay. You leave all this,
 you have food. I am warning you, Salma. Make your daughter understand. I shouldn’t see this girl 
Annie around Ramsha. If this happens, then she will see the worst in me. Don’t worry. I have made Annie understand well, 
before you asked me. Now you don’t worry, have food. What do I eat? I am unable to eat due to
 the environment of the home. Food. Food. I don’t understand anything, Afnan. No person in the home 
is willing to talk to me. What do I do? You please pray for me, that, God makes it easy for me. Yes. Okay, I will talk to you later. Goodbye. Annie. Annie, are you too upset 
with me like everyone else? I admit I made a big mistake and don’t you believe that
 I realize my mistake? I will answer every 
question of yours Ramsha, but before that you
 will have to answer my questions. Why don’t girls like you 
think before running from home, that after them running away, their sisters, the girls of their home will have to
 bear the consequences of them running away. What happened Ramsha? Why are you looking away? You ran away from home, but I suffered the punishment for your sin. Everything of mine got restricted. Coming and going. Talking on the phone. To the extent, that I was even 
stopped from combined studies. You left the home. You fulfilled your wishes. I was even deprived of my needs. I wish you were not this selfish. I wish you had not run
 after your unruly wishes. I wish… I wish you had not left all the relations. Because of you so many mothers 
would lose trust in their daughters and so many brothers
 lose their trust in their sisters. To the extent that they 
are even deprived of their studies. You know there is something. 
Yes? You must not have missed me, right? How did you find out? Just like that. But this time, I really missed you. Seriously? No, no, you are joking or are you speaking the truth? Yes, I am speaking the truth. Oh wow, this was so unexpected. This means you know my worth. Yes, a little. This much. Yes, this little bit of 
care of yours is enough for me. So thank you. The pleasure is all mine. Okay come on, quickly finish your food,
 you have to drop me too. Where? To Sara, I had told you. Hey, we have come together after so long, 
you are not going anywhere. You are spending time with me. 
I have to talk to you about a lot of things. Afnan, she must be waiting for me. Hey, if she is waiting, then let her. I don’t care. Call her and tell her you are busy,
 you have a meeting. In fact, why do you have to lie? 
Tell her you are with me, that’s it. What has happened to you today? Something really special happened today. Today, after a long time... ...you made me realize
 that you too love me. So, I feel great. So I want to spend as much
 time as I can with you today. A lot of time. Shameless girl. Are you not ashamed? You are holding my hand in
 the crowded restaurant? Girl. I am not ashamed at all today. Mehnaz. Mehnaz, bring me a cup of tea. Papa, your tea. Mehnaz. Yes. Yes. Coming. Yes. Do you have idea how long
 I have been here for? I was cleaning the room. Clean the room later, bring tea for me. Papa, I just made tea. Bring tea for me in the room. Rashid, I will take care of this, 
you take care of the hedges. Water it. Yes, there. There. Fine, sir. Greetings uncle. 
Greetings. Greetings dad. Where are you coming from, children? Dad, Alizay wanted to shop a little, 
so I took her to the mall. Okay. Okay. Alizay, child. Yes? When you go out, then cover yourself with a veil or scarf. Wear a loose dress.
 It doesn’t look reasonable like this, okay? I will have to drag her out. 
Come on. For God’s sake. 
No. Papa… Stop. She will not go anywhere. Brother Sajid, what are you saying? How can she live here in
 the presence of my young daughter? This girl is not worthy
of keeping in this home. Salma, who are you to drag 
my daughter out of my home? Sister in law, why would 
we keep this girl here? She is not a girl. She is my daughter. My daughter. She agreed to her father getting 
defamed in front of the world. Fine. But I don’t accept that my daughter
 is dragged out of my home. Papa, your tea. Mehnaz. Yes. Yes. Coming. Yes. Do you have idea 
how long I have been here for? I was cleaning the room. Clean the room later, bring tea for me. Papa, I just made tea. Bring tea for me in the room. Papa. Papa, I am not able to
 tolerate you being upset. You have kept me at home, but you have taken me 
out of your heart. Till you don’t forgive me, 
my heart will not find peace. I know I made a big mistake. I committed a big sin, I made your head bow down, I broke your trust, I embarrassed everyone. I should have been 
a source of pride for you, but I became a source of regret. I am not a good daughter. Papa, forgive me. Forgive me. I am apologizing with my heart, 
please forgive me. If you don’t forgive me,
then I will die, papa. Forgive me. Child, these relations 
are like ears on your face. Even if you cut off one ear, your own face becomes hideous. I have forgiven you. No. You have not forgiven me. You have just saved me. You have saved me from
 the insult that had become my fate. It would have ruined and defamed me. You didn’t forgive me. Forgive me, papa. Forgive me with your heart…
Come on, get up. Get up. Sit. Papa. Papa, forgive me with your heart. I really cannot find peace. If you don’t forgive me, I will die. Forgive me. Please forgive me, papa. Give me another chance. I will not do anything after this. Forgive me with your heart, please. Please, papa. You are stubborn since childhood, after all, you are my daughter. I forgave you with my heart, child. Mama, you always take uncle’s side. Child, what is there to take his side on? If brother stops you from something, then it has your betterment. Mama, I know what is better for me well. He doesn’t have to teach me. Lower your voice, Alizay. If brother hears you, he will be hurt. It is better that he hears me. Mama, getting married in no way means
 that I compromise on everything. I have my own lifestyle, my own life. This is not a compromise, this is obedience and after all, every girl adapts according to her in-laws. Right now, you thank God that you don’t have a mother and sister in law 
or girls compromise on everything. Leave it, mama. Uncle is no less than a mother in law. He is playing the role of
 both a father and mother in law. Okay, enough. Relax. Here you go son, water. Tell elder papa that 
Ramsha won’t go to university now. Shani, her parents are alive to make this decision. You don’t need to worry about this. Yes, so if it was in their control, they would make her sit on their
 heads despite the defamation. Now whatever is to be done, 
we have to do it ourselves. Don’t talk too much.
Quietly eat your food. The elders are there in the home. When the elders are not able to do anything, 
then the young ones have to do it. I should even talk to you. You have no manners 
on how to talk to elders. Meaning, now you will judge
 the capabilities of your elders, you have grown up so big? Sit down. Sit down. Hear one thing, don’t you dare speak 
a word in this regards. Understand? I don’t want that my son 
becomes part of the curses of others. I don’t know what sort of old 
fashioned thinking you have. Sister in law. 
Yes? Will you go to the three day
 mourning of Rashida’s mother in law? Yes, I will go, because 
I couldn’t go to the funeral. When will you go? There is just some work in the kitchen,
 let me finish this, then we will go. Yes, I too will cook these vegetables, 
then we will go. Sister in law. 
Yes? If someone over there 
asks about Ramsha, what will you say? Salma, if you don’t want to go 
with me because of Ramsha, then no issues, you go alone.
 I will not go. No, no, sister in law. There is nothing like that. I just asked, and if you don’t have an issue,
 then what problem can I have? What are you still doing here? 
Did you not leave? I am waiting for sister in law,
 she has gone to get ready. Okay listen, cook rice and send it on the shop. I have had a pain in 
my stomach for the past two days. Okay, fine. I was anyway saying that 
I will cook food from home and send it. Okay tell me, should I send some pickles 
or something with the rice? Are you out of your mind? I am telling you 
I have pain in my stomach and you are saying that you will 
send pickles and sauce with the rice? I just want rice, that’s it. Okay, fine. Let’s go papa. Yes. Annie, I will send Shani at 4 pm, 
you come back with him. Don’t sit there 
and talk with your friends. Study and finish all the work
 and come back straight home. Finish all the work. I will not let you go to your 
friends’ home again and again. Sure mama. Come on, 
papa, we are getting late. What are you still doing here? 
Why did you not go to the shop? I was just leaving, papa. You were not leaving, leave already. Arshad must be waiting
 for you in warehouse. And listen to me, you have to go to pick up your 
sister from her friend’s home at 4 pm. Do you have no other work? Do you just have to go visit friends? I am going to study, 
I am not going for an outing. I had asked papa to get me an
admission in the coaching center, but no one listens to me. Okay, so that you can go out using
 the coaching as an excuse. Come on, Annie. 
We are getting late. Come on. Get up. Get up. Go to the shop. I am coming. I am coming, papa. Goodbye. Sister in law, come quickly, we are getting late. Where are you people going? It is the third day mourning of Rashida’s 
mother in law, we are going there. Should I make you tea? Okay, I will just bring it.
