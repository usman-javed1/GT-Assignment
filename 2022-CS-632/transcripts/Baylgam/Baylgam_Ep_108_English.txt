Alizeh, you getting worried wouldn’t help,
my love. Mom, how should I not worry? Ramsha will give a son to Afnan
and I will get a daughter, that way, Ramsha’s value will increase
in front of Afnan. Ramsha will be called the mom of a son. What are these superstitious things
you are talking to me? Okay, tell me one thing, has Afnan ever said something
like this to you, that I want a son or a daughter? No, he has never said anything like that. End of story then, if Ramsha’s aunt even said
something like that, it wouldn’t make any difference. Whatever God wants, will happen. Alizeh you should pray that
God bless you with a healthy baby, that’s it. There is no need to worry,
just relax. I wanted to give Afnan
the happiness of a child, but now he will also have a child
from Ramsha, this girl has ruined my
entire happiness. What are you saying, Alizeh? You will be the one who gives
the first child to Afnan. I am telling you there is definitely
something wrong, she is definitely doing
some black magic that is why whatever she wants,
happens. God knows what is the truth, but I have seen that she is very
punctual in offering prayers, she doesn’t let any prayer
go unoffered, I guess that is why God answers
all her prayers. Afnan, may I ask you something? Sure? Do you want a son or a daughter? What is this question? All of this is in God’s control, 
not ours. We will happily accept whatever 
God blesses us with. But every person has some wish, what do you wish for? A son or a daughter? My wish, is just a healthy child. I just pray whether God blesses us with 
a son and a daughter, I just hope they are complete and they have a good fate. However, I do have a wish that if I have a son, I will name him after my father, Qasim. It means that you wish for a son. Look Afnan, I haven’t given you any responsibility
 that you cannot take, I have tried to bring you ease, after the demise of your mother, I have fulfilled my responsibility 
as a father, with complete honesty. Dad, you are absolutely right, 
you have always... you have always taken care of me 
with full honesty, you are a very good father. That’s very good news, Aunt, yes, yes, all of us will definitely come,
if God wills. Okay, listen, please make me talk to Annie 
as soon as she comes. Okay Aunt, take care of yourself. Bye. Afnan? 
Yeah? It was Aunt’s call, she was telling me that it is Annie’s 
Henna ceremony tomorrow and they have invited all of us. She was saying it with so much love that
she would be glad if all of us would come. What happened, Afnan? 
What are you thinking? Afnan, you will go, right? I don’t think we should go there. Look, I know very well that you are very close to them, but whatever happened 
because of them in this house, do you really think people won’t talk
 if any of us go there? Please call them and 
make an excuse, we cannot go there. Dude, I won’t be able to 
take you shopping, do one thing, go with Aunt, look you guys take very long in shopping and I have a lot of work at the office,
 I will be busy. By the way, I am going shopping 
with Mom only, going with you means that 
we have to come back quickly. Shopping cannot be done 
in an hour. Dude, shopping actually gets 
done in an hour, you women take very long. Okay may I go now? 
Yes, take this card. Thank you. Bye. Bye, I am going as well. Afnan? 
Hmm? Are you going somewhere? Yes, I am going to the office, why? Umm, Annie called, her wedding events are starting, 
today is the Henna ceremony, she said she will get upset 
if I don’t attend it. If you may allow, 
may I attend Annie’s wedding? I won’t demand anything 
from you after this and Aunt will even get upset 
if I won’t go, please try to understand. This is the last demand, I won’t be stubborn about 
anything after this. It means, you won’t listen to me. I will, just let me go today for the last time, 
please. Okay fine, fine. I will ask the driver to take you 
but come back in time. Thank you so much, Afnan. You’re welcome. I am very embarrassed. I should have believed you, I should have trusted your character,
yourself, and everything. But just give me one last chance, try to trust me this time, I won’t break your trust. Ramsha? Greetings, Aunt. 
Greetings, my child, you got so late I have been
waiting for you for so long. I am so sorry, Aunt, there was so much traffic,
don’t even ask. Where is Annie? Annie is getting ready. I will go look after your Uncle, he has been roaming around in the same 
clothes since morning doing house chores, he hasn’t even gotten ready, 
there is a lot of work but that doesn’t mean you should 
roam around like this, he doesn’t care that 
guests are coming. You know Uncle has always 
been like that, if he has some work, 
he prioritizes his work first and then would do anything else. Don’t worry, he will get ready. 
Yes. By the way, the house looks 
very beautiful, you guys have done a very 
pretty set up. Yes, it looks very beautiful, 
Shani’s friends have done all this. I stopped them so much told them 
to just do a normal setup, there was no need to do anything 
very expensive. But Shani said, Mom, 
it is my sister’s wedding, there shouldn’t be anything lacking. By the grace of God, my son has become
very intelligent and responsible, right? Okay, I am going to go sit there 
and wait till Annie gets ready. Yes, come, I will go check 
on your Uncle as well. You look so beautiful, 
by the grace of God. Thank you. You have come, Ramsha, I wouldn’t have sat for my ceremony, 
hadn’t you come. I knew it, that is why I have come. You look very beautiful, 
by the grace of God, you look like a doll. Thank You, Ramsha, I couldn’t get anything,
so I wore this, do you have any other jewellery? I don’t have it. You should have told me 
earlier Annie, I have so much jewellery I could have brought 
something for you. You can’t go, but brother can, 
brother will bring it. Okay, you call Shani and ask him to go to 
my home I will call Aunt Afsheen meanwhile. Okay, okay. Mom, what is this? Actually, Shani’s sister is getting married so Shani is here to get 
Ramsha’s jewellery. Oh, by the way, if there was a shortage 
of money at your end, you could have just asked Mom. Mom is very generous with 
charity for all such things. That is not needed. That’s strange, accepting charity would have been 
better than begging. Yes, Alizeh is right by the way and you have made a 
huge sacrifice anyway, after all your ex-wife has lived here, and spent time here, so this is your right. You must mind your tongue. I am standing in your house 
that doesn’t mean you can say whatever you want to. Hey, what did mom say? She is right, 
she is just stating the truth. Now, you guys have married Ramsha 
in this house so you can take advantage 
out of it, right? Actually, you still haven’t 
understood us, we don’t make relationships based 
on richness and poverty, we are poor but not shameless. Oh, oh, you are so shameful, you would have been shameful had 
you kept your cousin locked in 4 walls instead of leaving her to have an affair 
with married men at other people’s homes. What? What are you doing? If you say a word more about 
my family, I won’t spare you and would 
cut your throat! What? What is he doing? I feel like slaughtering her here but I have just stopped my hand 
because of Ramsha. Put this down, 
it can hurt her. You can take whatever 
you want from this house, we won’t say anything but put this down, please. Please. Mom, who is this animal kind of a man? Call the police, don’t let him go. Take me with you to Dubai, look Shani, take me with you, I want to live with you, we will start a new life there and it will just be you and me in that life and no third person, we will leave all the bitterness of 
the past and regrets here. We will start a new life, I want to live with you, I want to spend my life with you Shani. Ramsha, are you mad that I should 
take you to Dubai with me? I can’t tolerate you here, 
I don’t want to see your face, that is why I am going to Dubai and 
you are asking me to take you with me? It has been so long since 
we are married, you didn’t love me even for once 
in all this time? You don’t deserve to be loved, yes, I am right, no one would like 
to accept you, you should be thankful 
that I married you, else no one would have asked you.
