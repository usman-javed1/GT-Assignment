[18.12] Doctor, is Ramsha fine?
[20.44] Thank God, both the mother 
and child are safe.
[24.12] Thank God. Can I meet her?
[25.64] No. Not right now. She is under 
observation right now
[27.92] you meet her in a while.
[29.68] Thank you God.
[36.84] You were getting angry at me for no reason.
Shut up.
[44.68] You didn’t leave any stone unturned to 
hit your foot with an axe, Shani.
[51.68] Thank God, it is Ramsha’s habit that 
she recites prayers before leaving home.
[57.08] God kept her and the child safe.
[85.20] I am just coming.
[86.80] Hey, dad, what happened?
[88.44] Greetings.
[92.08] Ramsha fell from the motorbike, 
she is not fine.
[95.68] What?
[96.88] Ramsha fell from the motorbike? How?
Is she fine? Did she get hurt?
[100.40] I didn’t ask for details, 
we have to go to her home.
[103.80] Yes, so what hospital is she in?
Let’s go immediately.
[105.76] No, not the hospital,
we have to go home.
[107.28] Let’s go quickly. I am worried. 
Come on. You come with me.
[123.32] If I don’t go home, 
then Afnan will surely wait for me.
[127.40] He will call me and find out where I am.
[130.56] I have also decided, 
I too will not answer his call.
[148.40] After all, he should care for me too.
[150.56] When I don’t go home, 
then he will worry for me.
[153.72] Why should I always worry myself 
for him. He too should suffer.
[183.08] You don’t worry at all, 
I am absolutely fine.
[185.64] Don’t worry.
[192.84] God has been kind
[195.44] or else the way Ramsha fell 
from the motorcycle and fainted,
[200.96] I got really worried.
[212.80] Mr. Qasim, what can we do?
[215.76] How can we trust a two wheeler?
[234.32] And the doctor has strictly advised 
Rimsha from traveling on the bike,
[238.68] but what can we do? 
We are helpless.
[251.16] You know I really want 
to buy a car for Ramsha.
[262.28] I even thought about it 
once or twice,
[264.12] but things didn’t work out.
[276.52] For now, I only have this bike.
[279.72] We will have to put ourselves 
in danger.
[295.40] I had given charity for Ramsha.
[310.84] God has saved us from such 
a big problem, after all.
[320.68] Thank God.
[322.80] Now you people be careful,
[327.44] you people be careful 
and take care.
[328.84] And Ramsha, child, you have to
 take care of yourself.
[345.40] Follow the instructions 
from the doctor. Okay?
[350.56] Yes, uncle.
[360.48] Tea…
[362.56] I will bring it. 
No child, you sit, I will bring it.
[399.68] You know, Mr. Qasim, 
if you ask me honestly,
[401.60] then I am really happy 
that you came.
[405.28] You visited after a long time.
[410.32] Yes, I really miss Ramsha and 
I want to come, but…
[415.04] You must have thought what would 
you do visiting us poor people.
[423.84] No, no, nothing like that, 
we are all equal.
[432.40] What is poverty and richness,
[435.24] a Muslim is a well-wisher 
of each other.
[439.72] If someone is blessed, 
it is only to test them.
[448.48] You have said something great.
[451.76] Absolutely.
[459.72] Shani, son,
[464.04] take care of Ramsha.
[474.36] A husband and wife stands like this 
with each other in troubles and difficulties.
[488.84] Yes.
[514.20] Meet me in my office 
in the morning tomorrow,
[517.36] but don’t tell anyone here, please.
[564.48] Is Mr. Afnan back?
[575.24] Where were you?
[578.40] I…
[580.36] Ramsha was unwell, I went to 
her home to ask how she is.
[584.88] What was the need for you to go 
to Ramsha’s home?
[590.44] If uncle had to go, he could 
have gone with the driver.
[596.80] Look, I am really tired.
[602.36] There was a lot of work in the office, 
then we went to Ramsha’s home,
[605.52] now I cannot argue about this 
after coming home.
[607.88] Yes, so that’s what I am saying,
[609.44] what was the need for you to go 
to Ramsha’s home directly from the office,
[612.52] to console her?
[617.28] I had requested you,
[618.84] but you as usual are not 
listening to me.
[622.44] I have moved on.
[638.60] I don’t understand what I should do.
[642.08] Brother, you please make 
Afnan understand.
[646.48] Making Afnan understand is not 
the solution to the problem, Afsheen.
[649.32] And what do you think I have not 
spoken to Afnan?
[652.96] I didn’t mean that, brother,
[655.12] I am just saying that those two are 
always fighting at home.
[659.44] You see, there are servants 
at home too,
[662.08] what would they think 
when they see it.
[664.44] Things have progressed further
 than this, Afsheen.
[670.68] You told me yourself,
[672.08] he said something so strict 
in your presence.
[675.60] I am afraid that Afnan might say 
something wrong in his anger or naivety,
[680.68] do you understand how delicate 
this relation is.
[687.76] Look Afsheen, you make 
Alizeh understand,
[691.04] tell her to bring a positive change 
in her behaviour.
[694.44] Look, her needs are being met 
from every end.
[696.76] She does what she wants. Afnan 
doesn’t put any restrictions on her.
[701.00] Although, I myself don’t like 
a few things Alizeh says,
[704.32] I don’t agree to them. 
But still…
[706.36] still…
[707.60] Afnan is not saying anything to her, 
and she has complaints from Afnan.
[711.48] I think Afnan is as fault.
[714.92] He didn’t keep his position 
respectable as a husband.
[718.20] You need a leader for the journey, 
and this is the journey of life.
[722.60] You need balance, 
and that is not happening.
[727.00] All this is happening because of it.
[729.20] The whole home is disturbed 
because of the behaviour of these two.
[731.92] All of us are disturbed.
[748.76] You know, Mr. Afnan,
[751.56] you are really concerned 
for Ramsha,
[754.52] my wife.
[759.68] You know,
[761.72] if my wife asks me for such 
a big sum of money,
[764.44] then I will think ten times.
[770.44] And then there is you,
[772.44] you wrote me a cheque in ten minutes. 
Amazing.
[775.52] Just shut up.
[779.04] I know you don’t understand my jokes.
[781.84] But it is fine.
[785.76] I will go now, goodbye.
[788.20] Now you won’t bother Ramsha at all.
[790.64] No, not at all. Any other order?
[794.92] Look Shani, try and understand me.
[799.12] Ramsha is your wife,
[802.68] clean your heart towards Ramsha.
[809.44] She is your wife, she loves you.
[812.88] and you…
[821.56] you too take a lot of care of her.
[831.96] Someone can only care 
so much for their own.
[836.92] I just want to see Ramsha happy.
[843.52] I want that she stays happy with you.
[849.84] She is your wife.
[853.28] I want that you fulfill her rights.
[861.72] Bring peace in her life.
[865.88] That girl has seen a lot of pain.
[876.00] As far as love is concerned,
[879.96] I don’t love her.
[888.88] I hope you understand this.
[939.92] yes, come in.
[944.16] Greetings.
[946.52] Greetings.
[947.64] You are still awake?
 All okay.
[950.36] Were you busy?
[953.92] No. No.
[955.48] Tell me, what happened? 
You look worried.
[961.08] I am tired, dad.
[968.04] I didn’t know that life would 
look away from me like this.
[982.92] The peace in my life is lost.
[991.84] It feels it will never come back.
[1001.16] I am unable to focus on work either.
[1006.24] I am really worried, dad.
[1015.76] Patience and worship are two 
strengths of the believer.
[1027.08] Offer prayers, have patience.
[1031.28] God will make better decisions.
[1036.96] I am not able to be patient.
[1043.96] It feels like the courage to be 
patient has ended.
[1056.80] What would you know
[1058.92] what the courage of patience is. 
Anyway, what do you want?
[1064.48] What do I want?
[1070.48] Me wanting or not wanting doesn’t 
matter anymore dad.
[1081.72] I made a big mistake.
[1094.48] The first mistake
[1099.72] was rejecting Ramsha’s love.
[1110.84] The second mistake of 
accepting Alizeh.
[1124.44] Now it feels like that
[1128.80] both these mistakes are such that
 they cannot be redeemed.
[1131.60] When you feel that 
they are irredeemable,
[1135.84] then there is no point of talking
 about it.
[1139.32] Dad, Alizeh cannot make 
that place in my heart,
[1146.00] that Ramsha has…
Stop. Afnan.
[1156.88] The one you are talking 
about is someone’s wife.
[1167.28] And it doesn’t suit a man
[1170.36] to talk like this about someone’s wife.
[1181.68] Control yourself.
[1187.40] I have no control on my heart, dad.
You have control on your tongue, right?
[1192.52] Control your tongue.
[1203.00] Don’t be hasty making a decision.
[1206.40] Let the decision come to you.
[1211.16] His decision,
[1213.88] the One who makes the best decision.
[1223.36] And yes,
[1226.16] after today,
[1229.04] I shouldn’t hear you mention 
Ramsha like this.
[1243.04] Go and sleep.
[1246.56] Alizeh must be waiting for you.
[1325.52] Tea.
[1328.44] Keep it.
[1330.04] Where is Shani?
[1333.00] He will come.
[1337.44] Greetings.
[1340.76] Greetings.
[1348.40] Where were you? Huh?
[1351.76] And did the work I tell you 
to do get done or not?
[1355.08] And tell me,
[1356.32] why are you not answering my phone?
[1361.48] I had gone to do something important.
[1364.20] How many times have I told you 
that do all your important work
[1367.76] after closing the shop.
[1369.88] Now I cannot manage the shop alone, 
I get tired.
[1376.60] I went to the travel agent. 
Huh?
[1381.16] Had I gone after closing the shop, 
he would have closed down.
[1384.48] Travel agent?
[1389.52] Why?
[1392.44] I am thinking of going to Dubai.
[1398.28] My friend Waseem,
[1400.32] he has found a job for me,
[1402.92] he says if I come, 
he will get me on it.
[1405.48] What?
[1407.72] You are going to Dubai
[1410.12] and you didn’t even tell me.
[1414.28] Mama, you had told me yourself
[1417.12] that when you are doing something, 
then don’t make too much noise,
[1420.84] it catches the evil eye.
[1425.96] So I thought I would let you people 
know when it is done.
[1428.28] Wow, that’s great.
[1429.76] I had told you to hide it from strangers, 
I didn’t tell you not even tell your parents.
[1436.36] Look, listen to me.
[1438.96] Listen to something,
[1441.00] this friend Waseem of yours is showing
you a rosy picture.
[1445.32] Going to Dubai is not that easy.
[1447.56] It costs this much money, 
this much money.
[1449.72] Where will we get 
so much money from?
[1453.68] You don’t worry about the money,
that arrangement has been made.
[1463.28] Where did you do it from? Speak up. 
Speak up, where did you arrange it from?
[1467.48] Papa, I will tell you 
when the time comes.
[1469.68] Mama, I am hungry,
[1472.24] serve food, I am coming.
[1479.64] Anwer, you keep a check on Shani,
[1485.64] what if he does something wrong.
[1488.64] Make him understand.
[1490.96] What is this deal of the money?
[1493.52] I will make him understand once 
I get my hands on him.
[1499.00] All day long, he goes around 
with his cheap friends.
[1506.68] And since the day, this damned 
Waseem came from Dubai,
[1510.12] that’s it, he goes around him.
[1518.72] He will go to Dubai.
[1523.28] I too will see if he goes to Dubai.
[1536.20] Yes, brother, 
you are absolutely right.
[1539.04] I think you have thought 
the right thing for these people.
[1541.68] I think this will be better 
for these people.
[1545.44] Greetings.
[1546.36] Greetings.
[1548.88] Yes, uncle you called?
[1550.60] Yes,
[1552.92] child, I wanted to talk about 
something important.
[1560.64] We were thinking that
[1563.08] you and Afnan take a break 
from your office,
[1566.20] take an off, go travel.
[1572.76] When you spend time 
with each other,
[1575.68] then these frictions, these 
misunderstandings will be removed.
[1580.40] Sorry, it is not possible for me.
[1589.04] After all, the office people won’t 
give me such a long leave.
[1597.04] Fine, then resign.
[1600.60] I won’t resign.
[1606.48] Look Alizeh,
[1608.92] we are not stopping you from 
your professional life, you do it.
[1615.24] But when you come back, 
you join the office with Afnan.
[1627.08] Look, his work is increasing 
he needs assistance,
[1632.28] he needs a partner,
[1633.96] if you work it will be good. 
What do you think?
[1641.80] Brother, that is such a good advice.
[1646.20] This way, both of them will get 
a chance to spend time together.
[1655.16] what is wrong with you?
[1657.76] I will not do anything like that.
[1667.20] The person who is tolerating me 
at home with so much difficulty,
[1669.68] how will he tolerate me in the office?
[1680.60] What do you want?
[1681.88] Today we are fighting at home today,
tomorrow this drama reaches the office?
[1693.56] And maybe you are forgetting
[1695.40] the strict words Afnan used.
[1700.40] Alizeh, listen to me and 
try to understand.
[1702.60] Please uncle, stop it.
[1704.28] This is all your doing.
[1706.52] You had brought Ramsha 
to this home.
[1709.28] Alizeh,
[1710.76] how are you talking to brother?
[1713.28] I am right, mama.
[1715.16] I feel at times uncle knew everything.
[1719.04] Uncle, you knew it, right?
[1721.96] Alizeh, be quiet.
[1723.32] Why should I be quiet?
[1724.88] He knew everything about Afnan 
and Ramsha.
[1733.60] He brought Ramsha to this home 
on purpose so that she gets closer to Afnan.
[1743.96] Right, uncle? 
Am I speaking the truth?
[1745.84] Why did you do this?
[1747.16] Today, you are responsible 
for my life being ruined.
[1749.76] You are the most responsible for it.
[1751.36] Alizeh!
Afsheen…
[1763.96] Have some shame.
[1816.48] Hey,
[1817.92] I don’t understand anything 
about this boy, Shani.
[1821.84] Ramsha, whatever he gets in his head,
[1824.84] he only rests when he does it. 
Now tell me,
[1827.60] how do I give him permission to go 
so far? You are in this condition,
[1831.20] you need him.
[1834.20] Is Shani going somewhere?
[1836.56] Yes, why?
[1838.20] Did he not tell you?
[1840.64] No, he didn’t tell me anything.
[1842.92] Where is he going?
[1844.80] Hey, he wants to go to Dubai,
[1848.32] he was saying I will go there 
and earn money.
[1850.48] He went to get his passport 
made today.
[1852.36] I don’t understand from where 
he got so much money?
[1864.84] He doesn’t even have such a friend
[1866.80] who would give him so much money,
[1868.36] they are all useless and selfish.
[1872.80] But going to Dubai costs a lot,
[1874.72] where did he get so much money from?
[1876.56] Yes, that’s what I am thinking.
[1879.24] Where did he get so much money from?
Where did he arrange it from?
[1884.08] He doesn’t tell me anything either.
[1885.56] At least, if he stays at home, 
sits with me, then I will ask him.
[1889.96] I don’t understand how 
he got so much money from.
[1893.28] God forbid he is doing 
something wrong.
[1909.48] Afsheen, why did you raise 
your hand at Alizeh?
[1911.92] You shouldn’t have done this.
[1914.60] What else could I do, brother?
[1918.28] Did you not see how much 
she was misbehaving with you.
[1923.64] Till today,
[1925.08] I have even spoken loudly 
in front of you.
[1934.44] You have done us a lot of favours
 brother.
[1943.80] I am surprised that
[1946.56] Alizeh didn’t think a little 
before speaking.
[1951.16] She embarrassed me in front of you.
[1953.92] Why do you think this way, Afsheen?
[1956.64] I didn’t do any favour on you, Afsheen.
[1959.32] I just fulfilled the responsibility of 
an elder brother, that’s it.
[1968.04] You and Alizeh are really dear to me,
[1970.72] you are part of my family.
[1976.04] But you shouldn’t have raised 
your hand on her.
[1985.80] Okay, you do one thing, you go…
go and talk to her.
[1990.08] Talk to her calmly, 
make her understand.
[1993.20] Come on, go.
[2016.68] Shani,
[2018.24] are you going to Dubai?
Yes.
[2022.64] You didn’t even tell me, Shani.
[2026.40] Now will I have to do everything 
seeking your permission?
[2031.12] Not seeking permission, 
but at least,
[2033.04] I am your wife, you can tell me, 
right?
[2037.68] Yes,
[2039.40] and that is my problem.
[2042.08] This is why I have to tolerate you, 
or else…
[2046.12] You have no feelings in you, 
right, Shani?
[2053.76] You are leaving me in this condition 
and going to Dubai?
[2055.88] Yes, I am going.
[2057.40] And no need to create a scene
when I am going,
[2060.44] because I will not stay.
[2068.52] The day I get my visa,
[2070.84] I will leave the very next day, 
do you understand?
[2075.96] If not me, then at least care 
for your child.
[2083.80] I know well what I have to do 
and what I don’t have to do.
[2089.20] I will see it myself.
[2092.44] You are a really selfish man.
[2095.16] Fine, do what you want.
[2099.16] I will not say anything.
[2100.48] When you have no feelings then 
why should I cry in front of you.
[2103.64] Yes, fine, then have a strong heart.
[2109.76] Where did you get 
so much money from?
[2113.92] I took It from you? No, right?
[2116.80] So mind your own business.
[2118.80] So that’s what I am asking 
who you took the money from?
[2121.48] Look, don’t drive me mad.
[2122.88] This is the reason, 
I don’t come home.
[2179.36] Mama, can I ask you something?
[2183.32] Go ahead, child.
[2186.64] Will you tell me honestly?
[2194.28] Have I ever lied to you before that
I will lie now? Ask me.
[2203.32] Am I your real child, 
or stepdaughter?
[2209.48] I know you are upset with me.
[2213.88] But child,
[2215.44] also understand my helplessness.
[2219.40] Slapping me was your helplessness?
[2224.08] Look,
[2226.12] it was necessary for me 
to raise my hand at you.
[2229.48] Had I not raised my hand,
[2231.64] then brother has been 
misled about you,
[2233.52] he would also have been 
misled about me.
[2240.64] Had I not raised my hand,
[2242.32] then brother’s heart would have 
become harder.
[2246.04] Now I have put the embarrassment 
and disappoint in our share on brother.
[2253.96] Brother must be feeling guilty.
[2257.72] I am telling you he must be guilty.
[2262.56] You tell me yourself,
[2264.64] have I ever raised my hand 
at you before today?
[2271.72] Child, you have no idea 
how far am I planning for.
[2277.08] What do you mean?
