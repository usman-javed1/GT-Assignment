[78.00] What are you doing here?
[80.60] I…
[82.48] Actually… I…
[84.48] When I said that this room 
will bever be opened,
[88.32] then how dare you open it 
without my permission?
[101.72] I guess you are forgetting 
that I am a mother,
[105.16] your could have become stone-hearted,
[109.76] but I cannot forget my daughter.
[117.00] I smell Ramsha from everything 
in this room.
[120.44] Don’t take her name in front of me,
[127.04] I don’t want to hear her name.
[136.04] And these,
[137.28] why are her clothes and 
her things here? Yeah?
[139.96] What are you doing? 
Remove them.
[141.72] What are you doing? 
These are Ramsha’s things.
[157.96] Enough! Stop throwing her things.
[164.28] The one who is not in this house,
her things shouldn’t be in this house too.
[168.56] She is dead for me
[170.72] and you cannot forget their memories
[173.92] if you keep the things of dead people 
close to them.
[197.56] Ramsha?
[260.84] Where are you Afnan?
[262.00] Your number has been busy 
for so long,
[263.80] I am even calling you, 
why aren’t you attending my call?
[274.20] Sajid, stop!
[275.32] Sajid, for God’s sake, stop! 
Don’t do it.
[276.84] Move. 
Dad?
[279.96] What happened?
[281.48] Dad, uncle is burning all Ramsha’s things.
[285.72] Burning things?
[290.40] Brother, brother, what are you doing?
[292.24] Stay away! If anyone comes close,
[295.44] I will burn myself instead.
[297.56] okay, okay no one will come close. Okay.
[299.56] For God’s sake, 
someone please stop him.
[304.36] Uncle, please, uncle.
[388.32] Okay at least listen, you talk a lot.
[391.00] I am standing at a bag store, 
do you want a bag or not?
[394.60] Yes, okay.
[396.48] Okay I am very bad at such things,
[399.24] I am video calling you, wait a minute, 
I am switching. Yes.
[406.48] yes, Afnan? What is it?
[407.76] Okay look at this.
[409.56] No, this one is not good, 
show me another one.
[411.68] Dude, you know it very well that
I hate coming to malls,
[414.64] I am coming to this mall for you 
for the third time.
[416.44] Afnan, show me a few more options,
 what is the problem?
[419.88] Look at this.
[421.08] It’s not good, show me more.
[422.84] Show me the one next to it.
[469.48] Here take your light.
[471.04] you brought it? 
you are so good, thank you.
[473.48] How is it even possible that my daughter 
demands something and I don’t fulfill it?
[477.20] Thankyou dad.
[478.44] What was the need to bring it?
[480.16] You fulfill her every demand,
[482.32] your love and pampering has spoiled her.
[486.04] Mrs, I just have one wife,
[488.48] if I wouldn’t even pamper her 
then will I pamper the neighbors?
[503.20] I am telling you that I was at friends,
[506.36] I was at her house,
[507.76] I am telling you the truth I am not lying…
[509.40] You should be ashamed of lying over 
and over again in front of everyone.
[511.72] You should be ashamed,
[514.04] you trust your friend and not me.
[517.16] You should die of shame,
[519.52] you got manipulated by your friend 
and doubted me.
[523.64] what if I maa not your sister, 
I am still your cousin,
[527.08] and cousins are like sisters too.
[535.52] Mehnaz, do tell Shani
[539.28] that not let his friends interfere
in my personal matters
[545.12] else I will be the worst.
[566.36] Sister in law,
[568.16] sister in law?
[570.24] Salma,
[572.64] my daughter bought all of this 
with so much love,
[576.52] she used to keep everything so safely
[580.44] and wouldn’t let anyone touch anything,
[584.52] everything has been burnt to ashes, 
everything has been burnt.
[589.08] Everything has turned to ashes, Salma,
[593.92] everything has turned to ashes.
[610.20] Ramsha,
[611.88] quickly bring the juice.
[632.88] Ma’am, this is a parcel for you.
[636.12] Happy birthday ma’am.
[637.24] Oh thank you. 
Welcome ma’am.
[639.36] Thank you so much.
[657.08] Here, your shake is ready.
[659.88] Oh wow, where did these flowers 
come from?
[663.36] Vicky has sent them. 
Wow, but what for?
[669.04] Don’t you know?
[670.60] Today is my birthday.
[673.28] Oh yes, happy birthday,
[676.00] may you have many many more.
[678.24] Thank you so much. 
And what’s in it?
[681.32] It has a cake.
[682.68] Wow, your boyfriend loves you a lot,
[686.60] you are very lucky by the way
[688.12] that you got such loving person.
[691.08] He wished you at exact 12.
[693.28] True.
[694.52] And…
[696.00] it’s his call.
[701.28] Hello?
[707.08] Thank you, thank you so much
[709.40] and I have gotten your surprise, 
I will open it in a while.
[714.76] Yes, yes, I will open it and 
let you know, okay?
[717.64] Okay. Okay.
[720.52] Bye.
[721.52] What was he saying?
[724.40] Vicky loves me a lot
[727.56] and he makes my every birthday 
so special.
[730.96] You are actually very lucky to get
 such a loving person.
[734.28] Thank you for this,
[736.44] but by the way, you tell me about yourself,
[739.96] I guess you even introduced me 
to your fiancé,
[744.24] then you told me something about him, 
I can’t recall properly right now.
[747.80] You find out all my secrets, 
tell me about yourself too.
[751.28] Forget all this,
[753.48] you will find out at the right time.
[755.52] And what is the rush?
[757.28] You open the cake I will quickly 
bring knife and the candle.
[759.80] Okay.
[768.92] He is an extremely disgusting man 
and such a jerk.
[775.60] What happened to you?
[777.16] Why did you come so early? 
And, and who is a jerk?
[782.60] Tariq Baig!
[784.20] What do they think
[786.12] that we will do what they say
and what they want?
[789.16] We have no self respect?
[791.40] You know he was getting frank with me
like I am his girlfriend or a wife.
[795.92] He has no shame,
[798.76] shameless!
[799.84] And I am not working with him ever again.
[802.48] Yes, yes, now you have become 
a huge star,
[805.48] you will decide yourself
[807.12] who you want to work with and 
who you don’t want to work with? Right?
[811.16] Ramsha, I told you earlier as well,
[813.80] you are new to this field right now 
and you have to compromise.
[817.24] This is your 5th day and you have 
already rejected 8 offers,
[820.32] and you know that is a big deal.
[821.84] Hania, everything cannot be compromised
[824.24] especially honor, I cannot compromise
 on my honor at all.
[829.44] I am not characterless
[832.44] and where are you going all dressed up?
[834.84] Vicky has arranged a get together 
to celebrate my birthday.
[839.72] Wow.
[843.12] I am getting a call.
[847.08] Asim… okay.
[850.20] Hello? Yes Asim?
[853.44] Umm,
[854.72] Asim actually I am a bit busy today,
[857.56] shall we plan something tomorrow?
[860.32] Yes, update the time and let me know,
[862.76] okay? Okay, bye.
[871.16] Vicky.
[876.36] Hello? Yes Vicky?
[879.72] Hey, why are you getting angry?
[881.96] I am absolutely ready, 
I was on call with Asim.
[885.48] Yes, okay, come, I am ready.
[888.36] Okay.
[893.16] Vicky is very possessive for me.
[896.28] If he finds out that I am busy on call
[898.28] he gets very angry and 
he loves me a lot.
[902.32] How cute.
[904.44] But what will you do alone at home?
[907.16] Come along with me, 
you will have a lot of fun.
[910.28] Are you sure? I mean,
[912.20] it won’t look awkward if I go there?
[914.00] I mean, he will think I came 
as an uninvited guest?
[915.80] Not at all, I am with you,
[917.80] just go and get nicely ready. 
Go, go, go.
[920.84] okay let me pick my bag. 
Okay.
[922.96] Okay I will go and quickly get ready.
[924.36] Okay, go.
[927.12] Idiot.
[933.00] What do you think that 
you will block my number
[935.44] and I will forget about my money?
[937.60] Hey why are you getting angry?
[939.80] I didn’t do it on purpose, 
it happened by mistake
[942.16] and I told you I will get you a phone.
[944.64] Just wait for a bit.
[946.04] I don’t need a phone etc, 
I just need my money
[948.16] that too all of 60,000, 
do you understand?
[950.64] Dude, I will give it to you, 
take it from me next week.
[954.32] Even last week you said the same thing
that you will return it next week.
[958.56] And if you think you can get away
with my money
[960.76] then you are mistaken, son.
[962.72] I will get my money out of 
your throat any how.
[964.92] Look, I am talking to you nicely,
[967.56] and you are showing me attitude,
[969.00] you couldn’t control the women 
in your house,
[971.16] someone took your cousin 
from your own hous….
[973.28] Shut the hell up!
[983.92] I need my money back.
[1101.12] wait a second Ramsha.
[1105.52] You drink it.
[1112.44] I am asking you to drink it.
[1120.12] Hania?
Ramsha?
[1121.88] He has added something to it.
[1123.60] What did you add?
[1125.28] Nothing, you have a misunderstanding.
[1126.68] I am not having any misunderstanding, 
I saw you myself.
[1130.32] What do you think of yourself?
[1132.24] Don’t I know you? 
Before I slap the hell out of you,
[1136.48] get lost from here,
[1138.36] I am asking you to get lost.
[1140.20] I will see you, I won’t spare you.
[1142.32] Yes, yes, you can see me later. 
Get lost.
[1151.32] Ramsha, relax. Relax.
[1154.20] Come let’s go out in the lawn.
[1156.32] Relax. I am with you, 
come. Let’s go.
[1203.16] Hmm.
[1224.60] Bye.
[1248.72] You are still thinking the same, 
Ramsha,
[1250.92] it keeps on happening here.
[1253.40] Hania, I am just thinking that
[1255.80] how people actually are and 
how they show themselves.
[1259.12] Okay forget all this,
[1260.56] let’s go to have an ice cream.
[1264.28] No,
[1265.44] let’s go home for now, 
I am tired, I want to go home.
[1267.72] I want to fix your mood. 
Come with me now.
[1270.84] Hania, what are you?
[1272.80] You are something and then you are 
a different person the next moment.
[1274.48] You don’t need to understand me.
[1292.04] Oh my Lord!
[1294.64] Nothing is hidden for you,
[1298.28] you are aware of seen and unforeseen,
[1302.12] my Lord! My Ramsha is naïve,
[1307.04] don’t punish her for the foolish mistakes 
she did
[1311.72] because of being naïve,
[1315.04] protect her,
[1318.40] she is far from us but not from you.
[1323.52] My Lord!
[1325.52] Protect her from all the hardships 
and difficulties.
[1337.80] Oh God! Hania,
[1339.36] you make me laugh so much that 
a person’s stomach start to ache.
[1342.92] See, I told you that
[1345.32] I know very well how to fix your mood.
[1347.84] True that.
[1350.48] By the way it was so much fun today,
[1353.36] did you see that how much protocol 
Vicky gave me?
[1356.40] I am just loving it.
[1358.96] You are absolutely right,
[1360.44] you are actually very lucky.
[1362.40] Vicky loves you a lot.
[1366.56] He must have a lot of sources.
[1368.60] Forget all this, he was just…
[1375.48] Let’s go.
[1379.04] Why is he calling me?
[1380.68] Who is it?
[1382.60] I have an ex boyfriend,
[1385.08] it was so difficult for me to get rid of him,
[1387.28] he is after me again.
[1388.96] Don’t worry, just take the call and 
tell him to not bother you ever again.
[1392.60] Say it.
[1393.92] One second. Okay?
[1396.12] Hello? Yes Daniyal?
[1400.08] Tell me what is it?
[1417.72] This girl does forget something 
or the other.
[1423.52] Let me call her.
[1427.44] Idiot.
[1428.12] Your dialed number is busy 
on another call, please wait..
[1438.00] Your dialed number is busy 
on another call, please wait..
[1443.48] Your dialed number is busy 
on another call, please wait..
[1468.16] Daniyal, hang up now,
[1470.08] I will send it to you 
if I have her number
[1473.72] because I have changed my phone 
and I don’t have her number,
[1477.56] why do you keep on calling me 
again and again.
[1479.84] Daniyal how many times have I told you
[1481.88] that I don’t want to talk to you on this topic,
[1484.28] I am very happy with Vicky and 
we are about to get married soon,
[1487.96] then why do you, again and again…
 Umm,
[1494.72] oh God! Vicky it was you,
[1496.60] you scared me.
[1499.72] Who were you talking to for so long?
[1503.32] Umm, umm,
[1505.24] Vicky, actually I…
[1510.64] Tell him.
[1515.72] What are you doing? 
Are you mad?
[1517.84] Let’s leave from here Hania. He…
[1519.28] You stay away from our matters, 
understand?
[1522.12] Stay away, come on.
[1529.08] You are betraying me?
[1531.60] And what did you think that you will 
betray me and I won’t know?
[1535.88] You are constantly talking to Daniyal.
[1538.92] Even though I told you
thousand times not to.
[1542.40] My friends kept on telling me
 like crazy
[1544.68] to stop trusting such a girl 
but I was a psycho!
[1549.24] Vicky, wait a second, okay? Look,
[1551.96] it is not what you are thinking.
[1553.76] Daniyal did call me… 
Do not…
[1557.44] do not tell me rubbish!
[1559.36] You were still talking to Daniyal…
[1564.20] Look Vicky…
Yes, yes.
[1565.48] Yes, Vicky, I agree I was talking to him 
but it is not what you think.
[1569.36] I understand everything as to what is it 
that you are cheating on me,
[1573.88] I trusted a girl like you.
[1577.32] I went against my parents 
and proposed you.
[1581.88] Look, Vicky,
[1584.00] I agree but I haven’t done anything like 
what you are thinking,
[1587.52] I am happy with you, I mean, 
how can you think like that?
[1590.56] You have betrayed me!
[1593.44] And you think I will spare you?
[1598.20] I left my parents and trusted you 
and you left me?
[1605.08] Tsk tsk,
[1606.52] don’t worry at all, 
I won’t do anything,
[1610.64] I won’t do anything,
[1611.84] I will kill you.
[1614.88] Hania?
[1616.68] Hania? Stop him, 
what is he doing?
[1619.56] Hania? 
Vicky?
[1621.28] Vicky? Vicky?
[1622.92] Vicky?
[1628.48] No. Vicky,
[1630.00] no, you won’t do anything like this,
I am telling you.
[1658.00] Hania?
[1659.28] Hania? Hania, Hania, get up.
 Hania, Hanai,
[1662.44] is there someone who can help us.
 Hania, Hania, get up.
[1753.40] Sir I am telling you the truth.
I haven’t done anything.
[1757.20] Her boyfriend Vicky shot her 
in front of my eyes,
[1760.64] he has killed her ruthlessly, 
I am telling you the truth.
[1763.64] you have said the same thing 10 times.
[1766.12] And you know the person that 
you putting such an allegation on?
[1768.92] So, I am telling you the truth, 
I am not lying.
[1771.64] Trust me.
[1775.64] Take her,
[1777.20] I will do the investigation. 
Yes sir.
[1779.76] Look sir, listen to me.
[1781.64] it is very important for you 
to investigate Vicky.
[1784.40] He has killed my friend in front of my eyes,
ruthlessly, sir.
[1789.24] He should get a very strict punishment, 
don’t spare him like that.
[1792.72] We know what we have to do,
[1795.44] we know our job better.
[1798.16] Take this girl outside.
[1799.44] Sir, listen to me. 
Come, girl, let’s go.
[1802.16] If you call Vicky and investigate him, 
that will be better.
[1804.48] Come, girl,
[1805.24] And you are punishing me instead? 
come.
[1809.52] I have spoken…
[1867.72] Hey girl,
[1869.40] stop the fake crying,
[1871.84] now we know who has committed 
this murder.
[1877.12] What do you mean by this?
[1879.56] I?
[1881.96] Why would I kill my friend?
[1883.64] What is wrong with you guys?
[1885.04] I have told you guys that her boyfriend 
Vicky has killed her in front of me,
[1889.92] and despite of knowing everything 
you are still accusing me?
[1892.28] Hey? Lower your tone,
[1895.00] this is not your home.
[1897.00] Else you will remember 
what I do to you.
[1900.68] I am sorry, look,
[1902.56] how can you put an allegation on me?
[1905.00] I haven’t done this.
[1906.20] This is not the reality, 
why would I kill my friend?
[1909.00] I am telling you that’s not the truth,
[1910.88] the ruth is that er boyfriend 
Vicky killed her in front of my eyes.
[1914.64] Why don’t you understand?
[1915.80] The court will decide the truth
and lie now.
