Alizeh, you are still awake?
You haven’t slept yet? When a wife has a husband like you, how can she sleep peacefully? What rubbish? I am absolutely right, I used to think you are careless
about me but turns out
you are feelingless too. When was I feelingless now, Alizeh? If this is not being feelingless
then what is it? The person who tried to kill me, you got him bailed? Look Alizeh, I understand your anger but I was helpless to get
Shani’s bail. You were not helpless, you got him bailed because
Ramsha asked you to. Afnan, learn something
from Ramsha, learn to fulfill relationships
from her, Ramsha is better than you who is
still ready to die for her ex-husband. Just shut up! There is no need to be angry at me, if you want to ask, ask your wife, ask her why is she dying after Shani. Thank God, that Afnan got you bailed else we wouldn’t be able
to face anyone. We have made Annie’s in laws
understand after so much difficulty. By the way who asked you to go
beg Afnan to get me out of there? Yeah? What would have happened
if I had spent two nights in jail? It wasn’t the end of the world. Are you in your senses? Your sister has her wedding
after two days and how would it look that sister is getting married and
the police are taking the brother, do you have any idea what the hell we were going through, I thank God that Afnan got you bailed else your sister’s home would have
destroyed before even being made, we are saved from the humiliation. Enough mom, there is no need to take
this useless favor from them. When I am telling you
I didn’t do anything wrong and they were the ones
who did wrong? So what was the problem? They would have taken us
to the court. The court would have let me go. Because I didn’t do anything wrong. But no, we want to take
favors from them. Shut up, Shani. There are some things,
if they don’t get done in time, then it doesn’t matter
if they get done or not. And yes, listen, your Dad has said you won’t go anywhere out, he will take care of all
the outside chores and you will look after
the chores inside the house. What is this, now? I don’t know, your Dad told me this,
so I informed you, now go argue with him, not me. Won’t go out? What strange things are
they saying? Alizay, is everything okay? Yes. Did you ask the doctor 
if it is a girl or a boy? I am asking you something, tell me, 
what did the doctor say? It is a baby girl. Congratulations to you. Now we will shop for a baby girl, I will change your room 
completely to pink. I will decorate it all myself. 
I am so happy. What is the matter? 
You are not happy. What if Ramsha has a son, then? What are you saying? It is not necessary. What things do you keep 
on thinking? You should be happy. 
Thank God. Come on. You did good that 
you told me all this. Now lets do one thing, 
let’s not waste time and we will do all the shopping 
for you. Should we go today? Afnan can I ask you something? Yes. Are you really happy or are 
just trying to be happy for me? What does this mean? Hey, I am really happy. Really, really happy. Daughters are a blessing 
from God. Yes but you wanted a son, Afnan. You had said that you wanted to
name our child after uncle. What difference does what I want 
or what I don’t want make. I wanted a child from you. Now whether that is a son 
or daughter, they will be ours. As far as a son is concerned, then he will be born 
when the time comes. We cannot do anything more 
about this, right? Hello. Yes, yes, I absolutely remember. I remember. Just give me fifteen minutes, 
I will change and come. Okay. Okay. Bye. Listen, I have a really 
important meeting, I will deal with that, after that
we will plan our shopping. Okay? You take care of yourself. Yes, but now I do have this desire 
in my heart, that if I have a son, then I name him after my father. Qasim. You listen to me once, Afnan. Only Shani didn’t have a fault 
in whatever happened. He told uncle that he came here
 to get the jewelry and aunt and Alizay, provoked him so much
that he took this step. Come on, please, don’t tell me this false story of Shani. Afnan, think about this yourself. His sister is getting married, his sister 
is sitting for her mayun at home, her in-laws are there, 
there are guests in the home. If he had to create this scene, then 
why would he do it on this day only? He could have done this on 
some other day as well. Think with a cool head, no matter how big of 
an enemy someone is of you, at least you will not do all this 
on the day of your sister’s wedding. I just want that whatever 
you want do with Shani, whatever proceeding 
you want to do, do it. But let Annie get married once, 
please. I used to feel that you are careless 
in my matter. But you are also indifferent 
along with being careless. Alizay, how have I been 
indifferent towards you? If this is not indifference, 
then what is it? You got the man who tried 
to take my life, released on bail. Look Alizay, I can understand your anger, but getting Shani released on bail
was my helplessness. It was not your helplessness, you got the bail done 
on Ramsha’s insistence. Afnan learn something 
from Ramsha. Learn to live in relations from her. Hey, Ramsha is better than you, who is ready to do anything 
for her ex-husband. You didn’t even have proper 
breakfast, Afnan. I am not hungry. You are still upset with me, right? Ramsha, whether I am upset or happy, what difference does it make to you? You always do what you want to do. That’s not true Afnan,
you are misunderstanding me. I am misunderstanding? No Ramsha, should I tell you something? The dramas all of you people 
create at home, because of that at least, my capability 
to think and understand has ended. And if all this goes on, 
then I will go mad really soon. Afnan, I just wanted that 
Annie’s home gets saved. Annie’s home? You just want to save Annie’s home? And what about us, Ramsha? What about our home? 
What about your home? Have you ever thought of saving 
your own home? What is wrong, Afnan? They too are my own, if I don’t think about them, 
then who will? Fine. Fine. Fine. 
Absolutely fine, I got my answer. Afnan…
You do one thing, you only think about them, 
don’t think about me. Because they are your relatives, 
and me? Who am I, Ramsha? Afnan, this… No, no, please. Please, now I don’t 
want fake consolation from you now. I am already going through a lot difficulty
 for you and you don’t care about me. What all do I hear from 
the world for you? Do you have any idea the pain 
I am going through to keep you with me, 
in this home. But you have to save them. 
So you do one thing, you shift there. Go and stay there with your own, so that you can find happiness, so that you can find peace 
in your heart. In fact, why don’t you 
do one thing? Why are you doing me
a favor living here. Go. Go over there. 
Afnan… Go, go there, stay there, 
you will be happy. Afnan, what are you saying? There is nothing like that. 
You are misunderstanding me. Listen to me…
I have a misunderstanding? Me, Ramsha? Hey, you don’t want to understand. I am tolerating so much pain for you, I am trying to make you understand
with so much love, but you? Girls like you cannot understand, you do what is in your heart. No Afnan, there is nothing like that.
You listen to me. I don’t want to listen to you, Ramsha. You know, having hopes 
from you is wrong. Hey, it is my fault, 
it is my mistake. that I thought you would 
change your ways, you will return to me. 
But no. The one who has looked away you can stop them in the way, but you can never make them turn back. If a person is embarrassed on what 
they did then even God forgives them. Forgive me, please, Afnan. God’s mercy is abundant for 
His creations, Ramsha. A human is not that great. You pray that God softens 
my heart towards you. But right now I have no space for you
in my heart right now. Afnan. I am really embarrassed. I should have trusted you. I should have trusted your character, 
what you said, I should have trusted everything. But, just give me one last chance, this time you try trusting me. I will not break your trust. Do you want a son or a daughter? We will accept whatever 
God gives us happily. Yes, but every person has a desire too. What is your desire? Son or daughter? My desire is only a healthy child. I just pray that whether God gives us a son 
or a daughter, they are complete and 
they have a good fate. Yes, but now I do have this desire 
in my heart, that if I have a son, then I name him after my father. Qasim. Yes but you wanted a son, Afnan. You had said that you wanted 
to name our child after uncle. What difference does what I want 
or what I don’t want make. I wanted a child from you. Now whether that is a son 
or daughter, they will be ours. As far as a son is concerned, then he will be born 
when the time comes. We cannot do anything more 
about this, right? Oh God, you are really merciful. For the sake of Your beloved Prophet 
and his family, clean my husband’s heart towards me. Put love in the heart of my husband
for me, my Lord. Accept my prayers. Amen. Where is Afnan? Rasheeda was saying that maybe 
he went out for some work. I have been calling him for so long,
he is not even answering my call. By the way, why are you asking? Is there something? Shani has been released on bail. What? But mama, you were saying that 
you have filed such a case that he will suffer in jail all his life. Not even a single night has passed yet. Ask this from your husband, because Afnan got released on bail. You got the man who tried 
to take my life, released on bail. Look Alizay, I can understand your anger, but getting Shani released on bail 
was my helplessness. It was not your helplessness, you got the bail done 
on Ramsha’s insistence. Afnan learn something from Ramsha. Learn to live in relations from her. Hey, Ramsha is better than you, who is ready to do anything 
for her ex-husband. Just shut up. My desire is only a healthy child. I just pray that whether God gives us a son 
or a daughter, they are complete and they have a good fate. Yes, but now I do have this desire 
in my heart, that if I have a son, then I name him after my father. Qasim. What is the matter? 
Why are you crying? Mama. Mama. Mama, Ramsha has snatched 
Afnan from me. She has snatched my Afnan from me. Why are you saying these things? What is the matter? Did Afnan 
say something to you? He said nothing. But Afnan wants a son, if that Ramsha gives him a son, then my importance will end, mama. Because I will have a daughter. Then what will happen to me and
my daughter, mama? What will I do? Afnan will leave me. I will have 
no importance, mama. My love, don’t think that. 
Nothing like that will happen. No matter how much I act strong, no matter how much I feel 
I can do everything, but I cannot live without Afnan. I cannot live without him. I cannot live without Afnan, mama. If he leaves me? If he leaves me, 
then what will I do? I cannot live without him, 
I will die, mama. That Ramsha has come
 to this home and after the son, 
Afnan will leave me completely. I will not be able to anything. I will die without Afnan. I cannot do that. My hands are tied. My hands are tied to the promise that dad made me make before he left. He put this responsibility on me, that I will always take care of Ramsha. You make Alizay understand, I cannot break the promise 
I made to dad.
