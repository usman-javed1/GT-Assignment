[24.48] Hello.
[25.88] Afnan, how are you?
[28.12] Yes, where are you?
[30.64] Me.
[32.52] I am at a shoot.
[34.16] Shoot of what?
[36.04] This is a surprise for you, 
you will find out in some time.
[40.68] You know Ramsha, I must admit.
[43.60] You are not as stupid that I thought,
[46.36] in fact, you are stupider than that.
[50.84] I am just getting the first shoot 
done right now.
[53.08] You wait and watch
[54.64] that I will do so many shoots, 
I will become so famous,
[57.20] that the whole world will be after me.
[59.48] Are you out of your mind?
[61.72] You think it is so easy to enter this field?
[64.64] The shine of this field looks 
good from a distance
[68.12] or else it is as difficult as breaking
 the stars and bringing them.
[73.52] What are you saying?
[75.32] You consider me your friend, right?
[78.08] So I am telling you as a friend.
[81.96] Here people use each other.
[88.88] You are really naïve, innocent, 
you wont understand them.
[92.40] No one is there to support you either.
[97.08] Either you had come from a filmy background
 it would have been fine.
[100.12] But right now you don’t even know 
who is sincere with you and who isn’t.
[104.16] Hey, Afnan, you are worried 
for no reason.
[107.16] You know, where I came for the shoot,
[109.36] the owner is your friend’s cousin.
[110.88] She is your friend’s cousin, 
not your cousin.
[113.72] How can you trust him?
[116.48] Madam, shall we start? 
Sir Shahmir is going to come.
[118.32] Sure.
[119.72] Afnan, I will talk to you later, 
I am a little busy.
[123.44] Ramsha, listen to me.
[129.40] What is she doing?
[164.96] Is the wiring work here done?
[167.04] Yes, yes, sir, just a little is left. 
We are doing it. It is almost done.
[169.96] Okay, after this come inside and 
check as well, there is a wiring issue.
[173.32] Don’t worry sir, I will come inside
 and check.
[175.96] Thank you.
[178.64] Give me the plyer and go inside 
and check what work is left.
[180.76] Switch on the light and tell me.
[182.32] I will check.
[282.36] Shani, where are you going? Stop.
[284.00] Did you fix the light or not? Listen to me.
[286.28] Work is left to be done.
[327.48] Shani.
[328.76] Shani. Shani, one minute. One minute.
 One minute, listen to me. Shani,
[331.88] please. Shani. Shani, 
I am so sorry.
[335.52] Shani. Please don’t tell anyone 
anything at home, please.
[337.84] Swear on your mother.
[339.36] In fact, don’t swear on aunt. 
You had loved me Shani,
[342.36] for the sake of that love. Please,
[344.36] don’t tell anyone anything.
[348.24] Really? Today you remember 
that love you never accepted.
[351.68] And just for your advantage 
you are swearing on it.
[354.68] No, I accept I made a big mistake 
that I rejected your love.
[360.92] See, I am accepting my mistake, right?
[362.84] Please don’t tell anyone at home.
[364.68] If they find out, papa will kill me.
[367.76] And after all,
[369.24] I just came because a friend of mine
 forced me.
[371.64] In fact, I wont get it done in my life 
again in future.
[375.48] Please Shani. I promise.
[380.36] You go home, I will take a rickshaw 
in two minutes and two minutes.
[386.92] Shani, I am coming.
[388.80] I will get a rickshaw and come home.
[391.04] You wont tell anyone, Shani. Shani.
[396.68] What have I done?
[432.64] Who is this girl?
[434.76] My new model.
[440.48] Maybe you would have seen her video.
[443.04] She is really viral by the name 
of Shopping girl.
[445.60] Coincidentally she is in the studio right now.
[448.00] You know
[449.60] how much I need such girls.
[456.88] They want fame and I want profit.
[466.08] Anyway, you tell me, do you know her?
[503.12] I don’t know what Shani would have 
told everyone.
[505.88] I hope he has not told anyone.
[510.68] It is not possible that 
he will not tell anything.
[514.08] Maybe he said nothing.
[516.24] If I think like this, I will really go mad.
[520.24] You know, I feel Shani would have 
stayed quiet,
[523.80] or else mama or papa would have 
called me.
[527.12] In fact, not call, papa would have 
come to get me himself.
[532.32] God, oh God, please keep 
Shani’s mouth shut.
[553.08] Oh God, thank you.
[555.88] This means Shani didn’t tell anyone 
anything at home
[559.08] or else all hell would have broken loose
 till now.
[562.52] Stop there.
[569.48] Greetings, papa.
[572.68] Where are you coming from?
[577.08] From university.
[581.52] I don’t believe that the daughter
[585.96] who I trusted blindly is standing 
in front of me.
[590.92] But you kept on deceiving me.
[594.68] What are you looking at?
[597.24] What do you think?
[600.12] If no one tells us, 
then we wont find out
[603.44] and you will keep on deceiving us?
[608.48] How dare you go?
[618.08] And you?
[621.16] You are responsible for this action of hers.
[623.56] I had told you not to take her into showbiz,
[626.32] but you took her side and took her.
[628.56] Whatever she is doing today is 
because of you.
[631.32] Believe me, I know nothing 
about her shoot.
[635.52] Had I known,
[636.92] then is it possible that
I wouldn’t have told you?
[638.68] Papa, mama is right.
[640.84] Mama knows nothing about this. 
It was…
[644.00] Great.
[646.12] The daughter is doing what she wants, 
and the mother doesn’t even know.
[650.24] Papa, don’t say that.
[652.72] I just went for a magazine shoot 
and nothing else.
[662.56] and Shani told you all this
 with exaggeration, right?
[665.96] I will deal with you later.
[670.80] One minute,
[671.84] you still don’t realize your mistake?
[674.80] You have no embarrassment?
[676.88] Instead of you admitting your mistake,
[679.32] instead you are screaming on others.
[681.28] What was the need for you to go there?
[684.68] Papa, listen to me.
[686.76] See it is a small magazine shoot,
[688.56] and they were saying that
[689.80] pictures will get published in the magazine,
nothing more than that.
[691.96] You know, they gave me a cheque. See.
[696.20] See, this, they gave me a cheque of 
three hundred thousand for a small photoshoot.
[699.56] Papa, look at this.
[716.92] Such a big cheque for a 
small photoshoot.
[719.64] Look at this.
[851.28] Afnan.
[856.32] Coffee.
[858.12] I made it myself.
[866.20] Afnan, what is the issue now?
[868.92] Now I have even reduced the days,
[871.08] I am only going for fifteen days.
[873.68] Here, you are making this face, 
upstairs mama is not talking to me.
[877.28] Afnan, listen to me,
[878.88] if you feel that you making this will 
stop me from going,
[881.44] then you are mistaken. 
Yes, I know
[884.80] and I am not mistaken.
[888.64] I know well, no matter how much 
I stop you, you wont stop.
[891.84] So just go.
[895.04] Afnan, why are you doing this, buddy?
[897.08] Try and understand.
[899.80] Me going like this will not 
achieve anything.
[901.92] I will go there and I wont be able 
to focus on work.
[904.24] Then why are you going?
[905.92] Is someone forcing you? Don’t go.
[918.60] What happened?
[922.52] Afnan, can you not even let me go 
for my happiness?
[927.16] See this is really important for me.
[934.04] Okay fine, go.
[936.88] Really?
[940.12] Afnan, I love you a lot.
[943.12] Yes, I can see how much you love me.
[947.88] I know you are upset right now, 
but you will get fine.
[950.68] I will convince you.
[954.48] Okay, have your coffee,
[957.76] I made it myself.
[961.20] Thank you.
[967.12] How is the coffee?
[973.96] Just like you.
[976.60] Bitter.
[979.84] No problem, drink it.
[992.48] Papa tore my entire cheque 
into small pieces.
[998.64] Really?
[999.52] Your papa just tore the cheque,
[1002.32] I wanted to cut you into pieces and 
throw you away on what you did.
[1007.76] Really? Then beat me.
[1009.80] Beat me as much you want.
[1011.88] Because you people don’t know 
anything better.
[1013.28] Be quiet Ramsha. 
Be quiet for God’s sake.
[1016.04] If you say another work,
[1017.72] I will teach you a lesson 
you will not forget.
[1020.88] Elder mama, you please go inside.
[1024.16] As long as you stand here, 
you will get angry at her.
[1026.52] Hey, if I don’t get angry, 
what do I do, Annie?
[1029.24] Did you not see what she did.
[1031.40] Because of these actions of her, 
her father insulted me badly
[1035.04] and only I know.
[1036.76] We think that our daughter 
is going to study.
[1039.20] We have no idea 
what she is up to.
[1043.16] I have thought about it. 
I have decided.
[1045.92] The first proposal the wedding planner
 brings,
[1049.68] I will say yes to it and send her away 
from this home.
[1052.56] Hey, who will sit here guarding her.
[1055.20] It is enough.
[1060.52] I was trying to make you understand, 
Ramsha.
[1062.88] You don’t listen…
You be quiet.
[1066.40] All this happened cause of your brother.
[1068.44] Had he shut up
[1070.52] then I wouldn’t have had to face insult 
in front of everyone like this.
[1074.52] Ramsha, you try and understand,
[1077.52] had brother not showed them,
[1079.68] then they would have found out
 some other way.
[1081.76] Really?
Imagine,
[1083.08] had the magazine come home, then?
[1085.28] Really? How would the magazine 
come home? Huh?
[1088.04] The newspaper has never come at home,
 a magazine would come?
[1091.64] And would the magazine come 
outside the door and knocked,
[1094.20] and said I am the magazine, 
open the door.
[1096.08] I have pictures of Ramsha inside me.
[1099.00] Stupid. Go from here.
[1101.40] I have found all mad people 
in this home.
[1117.20] See, this, they gave me a cheque of 
three hundred thousand for a small photoshoot.
[1126.24] Such a big cheque for 
a small photoshoot.
[1129.00] Look at this.
[1176.88] You are a really shameless man, 
you know.
[1179.88] You have no shame at all.
[1183.28] Do one thing, why don’t you drown 
in this tea and die.
[1190.24] What shame are you talking about?
[1192.20] You should be ashamed that you were ruining
the respect of this home.
[1194.88] Whatever I was doing was my personal matter.
 Do you understand?
[1197.92] Why did you get upset?
[1200.12] And I had requested you so much
[1202.52] that please don’t tell anyone, 
but you did all that you could.
[1206.68] You are an imbecile. That’s why.
[1209.92] Shut your mouth.
 I am not a liar like you.
[1212.84] You are a liar. 
You are  really big liar.
[1216.48] You lied that you love me, 
you like me.
[1221.28] Hear me out clearly,
[1223.16] the ones who love cover someone’s flaws,
[1225.64] they don’t ruin respect in public.
[1228.20] Whatever I did , 
I did it for your betterment.
[1230.28] Look at this.
[1231.64] Even now you are lying. 
You are lying.
[1234.96] Whatever you did was your own benefit.
[1238.56] That love of yours is selfish, 
and even this hatred is selfish.
[1242.40] Whatever you do is for your own self.
[1244.60] You enjoyed getting praised and 
getting me insulted of everyone.
[1248.36] I got you insulted?
[1250.56] Get your mind fixed.
[1252.44] Whatever was done with you, 
was done by you, yourself.
[1254.68] Understand this.
[1256.24] You don’t have shame, 
at least care for us.
[1259.72] I don’t know what nonsense my friend 
was speaking about you
[1261.80] I couldn’t even look him in the eyes.
[1263.20] Hey, I have not taken up the responsibility
for everyone’s respect, understand?
[1267.36] What are you talking about shame?
[1269.40] If you were so respectable, 
you wouldn’t be arguing with me,
[1272.20] you would have gone and 
slapped your friend on his face.
[1274.96] Shameless!
[1289.20] I really miss you,
[1291.56] I cannot even focus on work.
[1293.80] Please Alizay, come back.
[1299.04] Liar.
[1300.80] If this was true, you wouldn’t have 
gone for so many days.
[1303.28] You know how lonely this home 
seems without you.
[1307.64] So much silence, sadness.
[1337.12] Ramsha. 
Yes?
[1338.60] Child, quickly finish your breakfast,
[1340.44] your father will drop you at the university 
and he will pick you too
[1343.56] Why?
[1344.52] Me and Annie go together,
[1346.48] then why would I go with papa?
[1348.20] Stop worrying about Annie.
[1349.96] Shani is there, he will drop her 
and also bring her back.
[1356.04] Fine, I will go in a rickshaw,
[1358.88] but I will not go with papa.
[1360.48] He is already upset, 
he will insult me all the way.
[1363.84] Now you talk to your papa 
about this yourself
[1368.08] that whether you have to go 
with him or not.
[1371.48] Now quickly finish your breakfast,
he is waiting.
[1376.68] I will talk to him. 
You keep me scared all the time.
[1380.60] Come on, what happened? 
We are getting late.
[1383.16] Come quickly.
[1386.92] Yes.
[1387.92] Come quickly, 
I have to go to the shop.
[1391.04] What is this? 
Be quiet, he will get angry.
[1416.32] You don’t worry.
[1417.68] I just spoke to Shahmir,
[1419.32] he said that a second cheque
 will be made for you,
[1421.80] but it will take some time.
[1423.80] Don’t worry.
[1426.92] Okay, I am getting late for class,
[1429.24] I will talk to you later. Okay?
[1431.08] Bye.
[1442.68] Ramsha,
[1444.08] first you end your friendship with that girl.
[1446.44] First she drives you mad and 
then you drive us mad.
[1449.32] Have I ever asked you to end your friendship
 with them, end your friendship with her?
[1452.84] No, Annie.
[1454.20] At least you don’t do all this with me.
[1456.92] Man, this is your issue.
[1459.28] Every time I sit down to make you understand, 
you get angry.
[1461.48] Stop it Annie,
[1463.00] I am losing my mind right now anyway.
[1465.56] It would be better that 
you don’t talk to me.
[1467.04] Papa insulted me so  badly on the way, 
you cannot imagine.
[1470.12] Thank God, elder papa only insulted you,
[1472.08] he didn’t stop you from going 
to university.
[1476.04] So that your education doesn’t 
get disturbed.
[1478.12] You know if my papa was there, 
I am telling you the truth, Ramsha.
[1481.32] Firstly, he would have killed me.
[1483.84] Then he would have stopped me 
from going.
[1485.76] This is elder papa’s love that 
he ignores every mistake of yours.
[1489.16] Ignore? Seriously?
[1491.32] Is this how you ignore it?
[1493.72] He taunted me a hundred times, 
he said a hundred things.
[1496.16] He has stopped me from coming 
and going.
[1497.92] You don’t ignore things like this.
[1503.04] I wish you could understand 
the feelings of elder papa.
[1506.48] It would be better that 
you leave from here.
[1508.36] I am losing my mind already.
[1511.64] Okay don’t get upset.
[1529.88] Mama.
[1532.08] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1534.16] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1537.24] This is our Ramsha,
[1539.68] she just came from university. Actually,
I had told sister Bushra for the evening.
[1543.52] Maybe she forgot to tell you.
[1547.28] Yes, you are right.
[1549.08] Actually we have to go 
to another place,
[1551.28] that is why we came before time.
[1556.16] Your daughter is really pretty.
[1560.00] Yes.
[1561.80] Go, Ramsha, go, 
change and come.
[1567.64] Sure.
[1575.92] You people have something.
[1578.44] Sure. Sure.
[1579.44] Sister in law, Ramsha is here.
[1582.88] Okay, I will see.
[1593.92] Greetings.
[1595.24] Greetings.
[1612.56] Brother,
[1614.24] you usually recite Quran after Fajr, 
then at this time?
[1619.20] I was just memorizing my lesson.
[1622.92] Lesson?
[1624.12] What do you mean, brother?
[1628.48] Afsheen, I recited the Quran 
to Haji Abdul Majid,
[1633.76] there were a lot of mistakes.
[1636.72] I thought I should make him teach me.
[1639.04] He will come after Isha to teach me.
[1641.40] Now you will learn the Quran
 in this age?
[1646.16] There is no age restriction 
of reciting the Quran
[1651.20] and I would tell you that reciting the Quran 
with the right pronunciation is the right of the Quran.
[1657.64] There is a Hadith that says,
[1659.28] the best amongst you is the one 
who learns the Quran and teaches it.
[1667.32] It is God’s blessing, whatever age you
get the understanding and guidance.
[1675.48] Yes, you are right.
[1679.40] Okay sit, I had to talk to you 
about something.
[1685.48] Yes, brother?
[1687.32] When will Alizay, come?
[1699.12] I spoke to Alizay,
[1702.32] she will be back in a few days.
[1706.28] May she come back safely.
[1708.28] I wanted to say that
[1712.28] going on such a long journey without 
a Mehram is not an action that is liked,
[1718.80] so you are her mother, 
be careful in future.
[1725.64] Yes, brother,
[1727.84] in future you won’t get a chance
 to complain.
[1735.44] Okay, you go, 
that’s all I had to talk about.
[1738.96] Sure.
[1749.00] Afnan, did you talk to Mr. Jamil?
[1752.72] Yes. Yes. Yes, I spoke to Mr. Jamil.
[1756.76] The files…
[1758.96] Hey, no you spoke to him, it is fine.
[1761.84] Thank God.
[1765.28] Mama, you should have asked me 
before inviting them.
[1769.12] Do you tell me before doing anything?
[1771.52] No, right?
[1772.84] Then why would I take permission 
from you?
[1774.84] I am your mother.
[1776.72] You are lying.
[1778.08] Everything that I have done in my life,
[1780.64] I do it after asking you
[1782.76] and the reason I didn’t ask you 
about the shoot is because
[1786.00] I was sure that you and papa 
won’t give me permission.
[1790.16] That’s the only reason I didn’t tell you.
[1792.96] Ramsha, you have done 
what you had to.
[1795.08] Now you will do what we tell you to do.
[1797.64] No, no, mama, don’t do this. 
It will be just with me.
[1800.40] You are my mother,
[1801.72] I am telling you I don’t want to 
get married right now,
[1804.08] so I don’t want to get married.
[1805.56] I told you this is not my decision, 
it is your father’s decision.
[1808.64] Say whatever you want to, 
to your father. Go.
[1811.92] Okay fine,
[1812.96] then go tell papa that Ramsha doesn’t 
want to get married right now.
[1818.04] Really?
[1820.00] I go and talk to your papa?
[1822.40] You will go talk to your papa yourself.
[1825.12] Hey because of you I have become 
the bad person in the eyes of the people.
[1828.88] Okay,
[1830.16] so you have decided 
you won’t support me now.
[1833.72] Hear one thing,
[1835.84] I am not from amongst those people
[1838.08] who give up even before the battle begins.
[1840.60] Do you understand?
[1842.32] Really?
[1843.44] You too hear one thing as well,
[1846.20] this is my home, not your shoot location,
[1849.68] where you will stand and speak dialogues
[1852.20] and after today, don’t say anything like this.
[1856.16] Mama.
[1858.36] I won’t get married.
[1885.92] Ramsha,
[1888.44] these are such pretty pictures.
[1891.08] It doesn’t look like you. 
Right?
[1893.80] I had told you,
[1895.24] your face cut, and your talent will 
make you do wonders.
[1900.48] You know Shahmir, he is getting 
a lot of calls from media.
[1904.20] He has a friend, 
who is a big producer,
[1907.08] he wants to cast you 
in his next serial.
[1910.64] Me?
[1911.48] Yes. 
In a drama serial?
[1914.52] Yes, absolutely.
[1916.08] You know how big of a producer he is.
[1918.56] His dramas run on different channels.
[1920.92] You must have heard his name, 
Danish Kamal.
[1924.92] Yes. Yes.
[1926.36] Every drama of his is almost a hit.
[1929.04] He called?
[1930.56] You know I spoke to him.
[1932.92] If you are interested, I will talk to him.
[1938.00] And he is ready to pay you well.
[1941.44] Money too? How much money?
[1946.16] The amount of one million rupees
[1951.64] One million rupees?
[1955.24] Oh my God, one million for one drama.
[1957.80] Yes.
[1959.04] Idiot, people earn much more than 
this in media.
[1961.80] Tell me, if you are interested.
[1963.92] If you are interested, then tell me, 
I will make you talk to him.
[1981.04] Hmmm.
[1982.80] I was sure uncle’s restrictions 
will increase.
[1986.96] Mama, by the way, 
if Afnan didn’t say anything,
[1989.96] then you could have said something,
[1992.20] even you didn’t say anything.
[1996.12] See, times have changed.
[1998.88] I don’t know why you stand quietly
in front of him all the time.
[2001.44] Say something.
[2002.72] But Alizay, brother was right.
[2005.24] that’s the issue mama,
[2006.84] you find everything he says as right.
[2011.56] You are already agreeing to 
so much he is saying,
[2013.96] I feel after marriage you will ask me 
to breath if he allows me.
[2017.72] Hey, but brother has never wanted 
something bad for you.
[2021.80] Mama, when am I saying that 
he wants something bad for me?
[2024.72] I know uncle thinks good for me,
[2027.88] but there is a big difference between 
his and my thinking.
[2030.64] He wants to take all the decisions
 of my life.
[2034.16] But I cannot do that. 
I have my own thinking,
[2037.16] I have my understanding, I want to 
take my own decisions, mama.
[2040.80] And I don’t want to be dependent 
on anyone for any matter.
[2045.32] I just want that the whole family 
understands this thing.
[2049.60] Okay tell me, 
when are you coming back?
[2053.60] I will be back in a few days.
[2055.60] But you had said it will take fifteen days.
[2058.48] So mama, let fifteen days be complete.
[2061.44] Listen to me, hear one thing clearly,
[2064.24] you will not stay there for 
more than fifteen days.
[2068.04] Okay fine, mama.
[2070.56] Okay, I am going to go prepare 
for my project,
[2073.32] I will talk to you later.
[2074.88] Okay. Bye. 
Bye.
[2077.84] Bye.
[2100.60] I think I should talk to papa.
[2103.92] Papa will surely understand me.
[2124.20] Papa, I…
[2127.52] I wanted to talk to you about something.
[2130.76] Yes, yes, go ahead.
[2133.76] Papa,
[2135.16] I…I…
[2137.60] I don’t want to get married right now.
[2142.60] I mean,
[2143.88] I am studying right now I will have 
my final year exams.
[2147.88] Because of that I don’t want to get married,
[2151.44] so that my education doesn’t get disturbed.
[2156.72] This sounds good coming from a person
[2159.00] whose entire attention is on studies.
[2165.44] But your attention is towards something else.
[2172.84] Do I not know?
