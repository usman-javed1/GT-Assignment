You will deny me in front
 of everyone, right? I will show you, your video. Alizeh, you… Hold this and see. Who is this? Look at it carefully. Greetings, guys, I hope you all are fine, so I have a huge surprise 
for you all and that surprise is, a famous TikToker, Ramsha by the name 
of Shopping Girl, who is doing what these 
days and where is she, where is she nowadays, I am about to tell you all 
this in my video today. I am sure you all want to know that the girl who went viral 
on social media is in what condition now. After getting viral by 
a social media video, and saying bye-bye to social
 media overnight, Ramsha has married a very famous 
businessman Afnan Qasim, I am sure you guys 
won’t believe all this, that is why I have proof 
of all this, look at this video. this… all this.. Afnan, I trusted you more than
 my daughter, I always used to defend 
you in everything, I always loved you 
like my own children and what did you give 
me in return? Yeah? Grief, pain, trouble? Do you even realize Afnan 
what have you done? Aunt, I am sorry, I know that you guys might have 
been hurt by whatever I did, but at least listen to me once that… But what? But what Afnan? You married Ramsha? What were you thinking
 when you did that? You have brought a second 
wife on my daughter? You didn’t think about 
your wife or your baby? I mean you became so selfish, you should have at least 
cared about someone. Afnan, you ruined everything. I used to ask brother to get 
this girl out of our house, she is a snake, she bit, she bit everyone. You ruined everything. Afnan, stay away from me. Please stay away from me. Alizeh, cool down and listen to me, I am telling you that you… I don’t want to listen to anything, you did what you wanted to. I don’t want to listen to 
anything you want to say, I am hating you, your existence,
 your presence. Dude, why are you not 
listening to me, Alizeh? You have no idea what 
was the situation… What do you want? What do you want? You want me to harm myself? Is that what you want? That I should hurt myself. No. You know I get crazy 
when I am angry. Alizeh, please don’t cause 
any harm to yourself, please. I am not coming 
close to you What did you think Afnan? What did you think that I will cry like a typical woman and die in the corner? Not at all, you have killed me while 
I am still alive, but I will kill you and that Ramsha. Listen Alizeh… Now just wait and watch what I do. Alizeh, listen to me, you are angry .. No Afnan, I am not angry, I guess you are not 
listening to me Afnan, just wait and watch 
I do now with you. Alizeh? What? What are you thinking? I am thinking what if Alizeh had seen me in this house? She didn’t see you, so why do you worry about 
this for no reason? Will you answer my question? What question? I want you to disclose to 
everyone about our marriage. , Afnan,the way everyone 
respects Alizeh as your wife, I want that respect too. That is the problem, Afnan, she will never do anything, because she knows she won’t catch everyone’s attention 
just for some small robbery. Try to understand Afnan, she is very clever, how cleverly she first took 
sympathy from Uncle first, she pretended to be innocent 
in front of everyone and then made her place in 
his heart by taking care of him, this is all her planning, 
I am telling you Afnan. Have you ever fallen in love with
 any other girl apart from me? I mean we are human beings, we can fall in love with anyone, it is not in anyone’s control. What? What is wrong with you? What is this time to ask 
all these questions? Afnan, tell me? Have you ever 
loved any other girl? No, no. I have never thought of 
any girl except you ever. And as far as love is concerned, I have just loved you, just you. who do you trust the 
most in this whole world? On Afnan. What happened? Why are you laughing? He is my husband, offcourse if I wouldn’t trust him,
 who else will I trust? A person should be their 
life partner. Yes, but I will never 
marry such a girl who already has an affair and who continues to have
 an affair after marriage too. What are you trying to say? Please don’t crack 
riddles with me. I just have one answer 
to all these riddles. Ramsha. Ramsha used to trust Afnan a lot. Afnan left her first and then Aunt left this world, now she has lost trust in people that is why she is not 
ready to marry. Af Afnan? Hmm, Afnan. Ramsha used to love 
Afnan a lot and wanted to marry him too, but she didn’t have Afnan’s 
companionship in her fate. I feel sad, not on you but myself, in fact I feel sad about 
my love that I couldn’t prove to you yet how sincere I am with you, I couldn’t make you believe 
that my love for you… Afnan, who was that girl? So all this is happening
 because of that girl? She was an acquaintance. I went to a restaurant so
 I met her there and spoke to her for a while and you are creating this huge fight... ...with me for an unimportant person. Unimportant girl? You lied to me for an unimportant girl? You could have told me the truth as well. I was joking, dude, I was teasing you like I always do. Alizeh listen to me? Alizeh, listen to me, what has happened? At least listen to me. What is your problem, Afnan? I told you not to talk to me. Okay, then do one thing, you must think and I will think too, because if you do this, then I will marry someone else. Stop testing my patience, you have lied enough, how much more will you lie? I saw you with that girl
 with my eyes, who was that girl, Afnan? Afnan, who was that girl? Alizeh, listen to me. How can you do this to me? Alizeh, Alizeh you… What are you trying to say? Say it? okay, I can only answer 
if you allow me to speak. Alizeh, you are getting it wrong, it is not what you think. I don’t want to talk to you at all. Move. Alizeh, please I am telling 
you to trust me, what is wrong? I trusted you the most, and what did you do? You broke my trust. I am so disappointed with you,
 Afnan. Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha, where are you? Why did you do this? Why did you do it? Hey, I told you, I told you that I will tell everyone about our 
marriage when I get a chance then why did you do this? What? What has happened? 
Tell me? Why are you yelling so much? I don’t get it what are you
 talking about, Afnan? Shut up! I was mad, I was mad that I fell in
 love with you, Aunt even told me such
 girls never change but I.. Hey, do you know 
I have become such ... ....a laughingstock in the 
whole world because of you? You have made my life a show. People are laughing at 
me at places, making fun of me. Why did you do this? Enough, Afnan. What has happened? 
At least tell me. Why are you putting 
allegations on me? And it was your wish as 
well to marry me. You haven’t done me any favor. Yes, yes, I made a mistake, I made a mistake that 
I showed my wish to marry you because I used to feel
 you are not the old Ramsha, you have changed but I didn’t know that you 
are still the same Ramsha who fools people, do you want to see how? Look at this. Greetings, guys, I hope you all are fine, so I have a huge surprise for you all and that surprise is, a famous TikToker, Ramsha by the name 
of Shopping Girl, who is doing what these 
days and where is she, where is she nowadays, I am about to tell you all 
this in my video today. I am sure you all want to know that the girl who went viral 
on social media is in what condition now. After getting viral by 
a social media video, and saying bye-bye to social 
media overnight, Ramsha has married a very famous
 businessman Afnan Qasim, I am sure you guys won’t 
believe all this, that is why I have 
proof of all this, look at this video. I didn’t expect such a cheap 
act from your end, Ramsha, I never even want to see
 your face ever again. No, Afnan. Afnan, this is a lie,
 I haven’t done all this. Don’t you trust me that 
why will I do this, Afnan? Am I mad that I will cause
 you trouble? ’ All this is a lie, I haven’t 
done this, Afnan. Do you want to say something 
else too or that is it? After this act, I never even want to see 
your face Ramsha, never ever come in
 my way from now. Afnan, stop, what 
has happened to you? I didn’t even know that 
Areeba has made any video and even uploaded it, had I known it, I would have refused her, why would I do it on purpose? Don’t lie to me. The girl whose name 
you are taking you have done all this
 along with her, but why did you do this? Where did my love fall short? Tell me? Answer me? You are getting it wrong, there is nothing like this, why will I hurt you? Why will I trouble you? Just think. I have understood now, only now I have understood
 you well, Ramsha. Only now I have understood 
who you are. I married you, made you the honor of my house. I fulfilled the promise 
I made to my dad ... ...who was dying and 
what did you do? You defamed me in 
the whole society, nothing else. Tell me where did my love fall short that you cheated on me? Afnan, I didn’t cheat you, why don’t you believe me? Don’t you believe me? Areeba has done all this, why will I do this, Afnan? If I hadn’t promised my Dad, I would have taken you and thrown you out of my life right here, right now. I feel disgusted in myself that
 I chose a girl like you. Enough, it’s good you did this, at least my eyes have 
been opened now. I am telling you not to show 
me your face ever again. No Afnan, what is wrong with you? How can you say this, Afnan? What is all this that 
you are saying? Afnan there is nothing
 like this, Afnan why would I do this? Ramsha don’t do this. What you are saying
 is hurting me, Afnan. Afnan I will die… Die! If you want to die,
 then go die. And after what you have done, it will be better if you die. Why were you saying that
 I will marry you? How did you even think this?
 Tell me? What is wrong Afnan? You love me, who will 
you marry if not me? What has happened to you if I talked to you nicely twice
 it means I will marry you? You didn’t just talk to me 
nicely a couple of times, you have always 
taken care of me, and this is not a friendship, you have been 
concerned for me, you saved me from a trouble. I just showed sympathy
 towards to you, I thought that she is 
probably a naïve girl who might need my guidance and if I can make her
 a good friend and guide her, save her from bad people, so this was not love. What do you think that I am not marrying you because I am busy 
in my work? Yes. Are you mad? Are you out of your mind? How can you even think
 I will marry you? It is my fault, it is my fault I shouldn’t 
have befriended you at all, but I was out of my mind, I thought she is an innocent girl and gets herself in trouble 
so let’s help her but you, you have been after me now. Okay, then kill me but I won’t marry you. I can’t kill you even if I want to, but if you don’t listen
 to me today, I will definitely kill myself. No. Now tell me what is 
your answer? Either you see my dying 
in front of your eyes, or we unite today, tell me 
should I kill myself? Okay, you won’t speak like this, I will only count to 3, then my dead body will 
be in front of you. 1 2 I am ready. I want you to disclose to everyone
 about our marriage. Afnan, the way everyone 
respects Alizeh as your wife, I want that respect too. You are my wife, that is a truth, a reality, you will get the same honor
 and position as Alizeh, just give me some time, and trust me during this time, I am yours. If I hadn’t promised my Dad, I would have taken 
you and thrown you out of my life right
 here, right now. I feel disgusted in myself that I chose a girl like you. Afnan, you have done wrong 
with my daughter. I don’t get it myself that what
 is happening with me. the ground is feeling 
insufficient to me. Since Dad has left, all the happiness and ease 
has gone away from my life. It feels like I have 
just gotten alone. You are responsible for
 this loneliness too. I am surprised that an intelligent man like you, how can he make such
 a huge mistake. You married Ramsha. Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys who are family-oriented and rich too, they marry them and that is what Ramsha did too. You are honorable, family-oriented and rich too, she married you and defamed you and then she got famous overnight because that is what she wanted.
