[25.76] It is not here. 11483.
[62.92] Twenty five.
[64.40] Yes, bring it.
[69.72] You are bringing two sacks.
[71.48] Look at your strength 
and look at the sacks.
[73.28] Hurry up.
[77.40] Hurry up.
[79.08] Hello.
[94.68] Be quick.
[98.56] Brother.
[100.96] Brother.
[108.84] What happened?
[109.76] I don’t know.
[112.56] Who called?
[113.88] How would I know?
[115.28] He was standing so close to you, 
did you not hear?
[117.08] I was working.
[124.72] Fahad, you bothered for no reason.
[127.20] How will you go so far and then come back.
 I would have gone myself.
[130.68] You surprise me, buddy.
[132.40] What is the friendship in 
which there is botheration.
[135.92] That is true.
[137.20] Believe me, 
no one bothers me more than you.
[140.28] You know there is a thing, 
you are a great actor.
[144.96] Actor reminds me,
[147.52] how is that new friend of yours?
[150.04] She makes amazing reels.
[152.92] I in fact, follow her.
[155.04] Really?
[158.48] Tell me, do you talk to her or not?
[161.08] No, I don’t talk to her now.
[166.08] That is good. Let me be her friend.
[168.40] Why?
[170.24] Hey, when you have ended friendship with her,
 then I will become her friend.
[175.20] I cannot give you her number, 
I have deleted it.
[180.44] Why?
[182.28] You were saying she is really interesting
 and you have a lot of fun talking to her.
[186.96] Yes, that is why deleted it,
[188.84] that is why whenever I want to talk to her,
[191.36] I am unable to.
[194.60] Hey, man, 
you should have asked me once.
[197.20] We would have also seen 
what is so special about that girl,
[201.08] that our friend was taking 
so much interest in her.
[203.08] Okay don’t bother me,
 make me reach the airport quickly.
[206.24] If I miss the flight, 
then dad will scold me.
[211.20] Drive fast.
[213.08] I am driving. I am driving.
 You wont miss your flight.
[296.40] What did Ramsha do?
[299.60] What did she do.
[302.96] It was better that she would have
 given us  poison before doing all this.
[307.88] It would have been better that 
we would have died before seeing all this.
[313.36] What will say to his father?
[315.96] What will I say?
[318.72] What did she do.
[322.60] Oh God.
[323.72] Sister in law, what is the point of crying now?
[327.12] I used to already tell you not to give her 
so much freedom and leniency.
[333.00] Salma, I didn’t know,
[335.20] I had no idea, this girl would ruin 
our respect and go like this.
[342.72] Annie,
[344.20] tell us honestly,
[345.76] if you know anything about Ramsha, 
or did she tell you anything?
[348.56] Child, if you know anything, then tell us.
[351.72] Make me swear on anyone, mama.
[354.04] I honestly don’t know anything.
[356.08] Yes,
[357.60] how is it possible that you know nothing?
[360.52] You two were together twenty four hours.
[362.96] She used to share everything with you.
[365.40] She must have told her and gone.
[367.32] Her, for God’s sake, child, 
tell me if you know even a little about her.
[373.24] I am speaking the truth, elder mama,
[374.88] if I had any idea she was going to do all this,
 I would have told you first.
[380.92] Where is she?
[381.92] What happened?
[383.32] Where is Ramsha?
[384.60] What nonsense were you
 speaking on the phone?
[386.40] Ramsha left the home and went.
[395.16] How did she leave the home 
and go in your presence?
[397.44] Did you go blind?
[401.76] I don’t understand anything.
[404.20] I don’t know how all this happened.
I know nothing.
[409.60] How did she leave?
[413.88] Speak up, why are you quiet now?
[417.12] You must have heard something.
[420.00] Brother Sajid, Ramsha,
[422.92] gave this and went.
[475.12] Hey, man, I had to run out of water right now.
[479.28] Why are the shops closed?
[508.96] God forgive me,
[510.24] if the water flows like this,
then the bottle will get filled till tomorrow.
[535.88] Stop.
[542.96] Stop.
[576.60] My bag!
[579.80] Hey,
[581.12] don’t you understand me?
[582.96] I told you all my things were left in the train, 
you are not ready to listen.
[586.60] I am telling you,
[588.16] if my luggage is not returned,
[590.08] I will teach you people 
a lesson you wont forget.
[592.64] After all, you don’t know who I am.
[595.60] The entire social media will 
reach here on one cry of mine.
[598.56] Madam, who told you to get off the train?
[601.60] And you can do what you want.
[603.88] Okay?
[604.64] And if your things go missing, 
then you will be responsible for it, not us.
[609.00] How will I be responsible?
[611.48] You people are responsible
 for all of my worries.
[613.80] All this happened cause of you.
[616.08] After all, the beautiful taps of this beautiful
 station has water dripping from it.
[621.16] How will a person fill their bottle?
[622.48] A person’s patience runs out,
[623.96] and if a person wants to wash their face...
[626.20] ...then you miss your train
 instead of washing your face.
[629.04] You people are really stubborn.
You don’t realize my worry at all.
[634.00] Madam, who had told you to get off 
at the station and wash your face?
[637.76] Hey, you should have washed 
your face at home and come.
[640.32] Oh brother,
[641.68] what?
[642.44] Have you seen your trains?
[644.44] Even if a person showers and comes,
 they are in such a bad state,
[647.60] it feels like you are walking in desert
 and not in a train.
[650.68] Look, I am giving you the last warning.
[652.16] I am saying it for the last time that
 if I don’t get my things back,
[656.28] I will not leave anyone.
[657.68] I have told you this.
[659.60] Okay madam, fine,
 you sit comfortably in this train,
[662.80] I will find out.
[664.12] I sit comfortably?
[665.20] My things went missing and 
you want me to sit comfortably?
[668.68] Brother Hamid, before this 
girl creates further problems for us,
[672.48] do something about her.
 Solve her problem.
[676.00] Okay fine,
[676.92] Mr. Kamal, you get on this train with 
this girl and go to the next station.
[680.88] The train will stay there for one hour, 
give her, her luggage.
[684.48] Come madam, 
I will get you, your things.
[687.56] I am telling you, if I don’t get my luggage, 
then I will not leave you.
[691.52] Come, you will get your luggage. 
Come on, then.
[698.20] This girl is a big problem,
[700.16] she has worried me.
[753.16] If you ask me honestly,
 I still don’t believe it.
[757.60] How can Ramsha do this?
[762.84] She is fooling you people.
[769.68] She didn’t leave the home and go, 
she ran away with some boy.
[772.76] I don’t know you people didn’t find out, 
but I could see clearly from her actions,
[776.68] that this will happen.
[778.08] She was having an affair 
with someone, she ran with him.
[782.64] Shani,
[784.12] what are you saying?
[786.72] Brother Sajid and sister in law are already sad, 
they are in so much pain.
[790.76] Hearing you talk will hurt them further.
[794.88] Mama, whatever I am saying 
I am saying it with confidence.
[798.24] She had an affair with a boy,
and she ran away with him.
[801.60] You see yourself, as soon as her
 proposal came she left the home.
[805.16] Did you see yourself?
[807.08] No, right?
[808.48] You didn’t see with your own eyes, right?
[811.20] If you didn’t see it, then be quiet.
[814.56] Control your tongue.
[817.00] Fine,
[819.60] I will stay quiet, 
but how many people will you shut up?
[823.52] What do you think? 
In today’s time this thing will not get out?
[826.76] Wont people talk?
[829.00] You will see how people find out.
[834.76] Who all will you shut up?
[842.80] You know well who I am talking about.
[846.20] Tell me who that boy is, 
I will go get her myself.
[850.60] I don’t know anything. I know nothing.
[853.00] Stop supporting her, I am telling you 
or else I will break your face.
[855.64] Shani,
[859.36] control your anger.
[863.44] If Annie is saying she knows nothing,
[866.24] then trust your sister.
[868.12] She knows nothing.
[870.68] You are trusting her like
 elder papa trusted Ramsha.
[877.76] Today, the result of it is in front of you.
[914.28] Yes, who are you?
[916.36] Greetings.
[917.28] Greetings.
[917.80] My name is Ramsha, 
I came to meet Mr. Danish Kamal.
[922.40] Brother Mukhtayar, come here.
[930.24] She has come to meet sir.
[933.44] I want to meet Mr. Danish Kamal. 
I am Ramsha, I have come from Karachi.
[940.52] Come.
[942.36] Yes.
[944.44] Fine, I am coming. Come on.
[1017.80] Hi sir.
[1019.80] I am Ramsha.
[1050.08] Ramsha.
[1052.80] Shameer sent you.
[1056.20] Yes.
[1059.92] What did he tell you about me?
[1062.56] Shameer was saying you are a famous director
and you will cast me in your new project.
[1076.72] Mukhtar.
[1078.08] Yes, sir?
[1079.68] Take Miss Ramsha to the guest room.
[1088.56] You go,
[1090.56] rest.
[1092.92] We will talk in the morning tomorrow.
[1096.12] Sir, Shameer was saying 
I will stay in a hotel room.
[1109.16] Forget about what Shameer was telling you,
[1113.40] just listen to what I am saying.
[1120.44] Yes, sir.
[1121.76] This is better for your tomorrow.
[1130.00] Yes, okay, sir.
[1131.80] And listen,
[1134.72] you will get all those facilities in this home,
[1140.28] that you don’t even get in a five star hotel.
[1154.28] Yes,
[1155.84] come on.
[1196.88] Elder papa, I have served food.
[1205.16] Should I already eat food?
[1212.56] The home where there is a funeral, there,
[1217.96] you eat food after the burial.
[1229.44] Right now, I have lead my daughter’s funeral.
[1236.96] Then I will eat.
[1239.56] Sajid, don’t say that.
[1242.60] Pray to God that wherever 
our daughter is, she is fine.
[1246.96] She is dead for me.
[1253.24] Mourn her today.
[1260.52] After today, no one will 
take her name in this home.
[1265.92] God will be kind.
[1267.40] She is dead.
[1270.52] Did you hear me?
[1275.48] Brother.
[1276.68] Brother, get a grip on yourself.
[1279.64] What did she do with me?
[1283.20] She killed me in my life.
[1289.04] How will I face people?
[1294.60] How will I tell them that...
[1297.00] ...my daughter ran away from home.
[1300.44] Brother.
[1304.76] While leaving,
[1306.92] why did she not kill me and go.
[1310.48] Stop it, brother. Stop it.
[1312.76] Get a grip on yourself.
[1315.20] You will make yourself sick this way.
[1318.48] Don’t say that.
[1322.92] Come, sit here. Come. Come.
[1324.72] No.
[1330.72] let me be.
[1338.08] Brother.
[1339.60] Let me be.
[1371.48] This is the same actress, 
who was on TV…
[1375.68] and this?
[1377.44] Mr. Qavi Khan,
[1380.04] wow.
[1381.60] Mr. Behrooz and Mr. Javed.
[1385.12] Oh my God, such big actors and
[1388.72] also Maya Ali.
[1393.20] I am so lucky that...
[1395.52] ...I am going to work with such 
a great man in the start of my career.
[1399.72] God, thank you. Thank you.
[1402.28] My future is made. It is surely made.
[1406.28] You know,
[1408.28] this is what you call a home.
[1412.44] So beautiful, so grand.
[1417.40] And then there was our home,
[1418.96] go from one home to another room, 
and from there to the lounge and that’s it.
[1424.20] You know, Ramsha,
[1426.72] don’t worry,
[1428.32] one day you will also have all this.
[1432.12] Such a big home.
[1434.32] Money.
[1435.92] Cars.
[1438.04] You will have everything,
[1439.60] and you will see,
[1440.80] mama and papa will agree just like that.
[1443.40] When they will see I have so much money, 
home, cars, they will agree immediately.
[1449.16] You know,
[1451.20] papa must have really scolded mama.
[1453.48] He must be saying that Mehnaz, 
Ramsha ran away from home, it is all your fault,
[1457.84] and poor mama must be crying.
[1461.64] I am sorry, mama.
[1463.56] Because of me you must
 be getting scolded by mama.
[1467.32] But what can I do?
[1469.36] If you people had given 
me permission for all this,
[1472.16] then I wouldn’t have had 
to take such a big step.
[1476.60] Anyway,
[1478.00] whatever happened, happened.
[1480.20] One day my picture will also be here.
[1482.56] Madam. 
Yes?
[1484.20] Boss is calling you.
[1485.72] Fine, you go ahead, I will come.
[1489.48] I hope he didn’t hear what I was saying.
[1494.04] My picture will also be here one day,
you people will see.
[1514.80] Good morning.
[1527.20] I…I saw your pictures,
that are there on the wall.
[1531.12] You have worked with really famous actors.
[1538.12] I didn’t work with them,
[1541.72] they have worked with me.
[1545.72] Okay.
[1547.32] You don’t worry,
[1549.96] really soon,
[1552.76] your picture will be with me,
[1555.28] in a frame
[1558.16] and put up on the wall.
[1560.88] There is a character in my serial.
[1566.84] Really great.
[1568.48] There is a lot of demand.
[1570.00] Really? What is the character?
[1578.16] That’s the issue with you girls.
[1581.72] You people want that 
you people get everything really quickly.
[1586.56] Have a little patience,
[1589.12] calmly and with patience.
[1592.40] I will give you the script, read it.
Read your character, then we will discuss.
[1600.12] Okay sir, done. I will do as you say.
[1610.68] That’s what I want.
[1620.84] Should I tell you something?
[1635.60] I really like girls like you.
[1645.48] Okay.
[1653.28] Excuse me.
[1654.88] Hello.
[1656.20] Yes.
[1657.48] What?
[1658.72] No, no, no, no,
[1660.16] the same location.
[1661.80] Hey, yes.
[1663.48] I will be offered such a character 
that will have a lot of demand.
[1668.36] Oh my God, you will make it big.
[1685.44] Where did you go, Ramsha?
[1690.12] Did you go with Afnan…
[1695.80] No. No.
[1697.88] You cannot do this, right?
[1699.52] Who were you talking to?
[1703.96] To no one.
[1705.16] I ask you, who were you talking to?
[1708.00] I think you too plan on running 
away from here like Ramsha.
[1710.56] Shani!
[1711.92] What are you saying about your sister?
[1717.88] If Ramsha has gone from this home,
[1720.12] or she has run away with someone,
[1721.28] then my daughter has no fault in it.
 Understand?
[1723.72] Mama, keep her phone with you.
[1728.08] And after today, if I see this
 phone in your hands, I will break it.
[1734.04] And if you want to talk to someone,
[1736.40] then either do it from mama’s phone 
or through papa’s phone. Understand?
[1757.80] I was not talking to anyone.
[1785.40] Hello.
[1787.24] Yes, who is it?
[1788.88] Ramsha?
[1790.40] What number are you calling from?
[1792.48] I was ignoring this number for 
so long that it is a wrong number.
[1800.28] I didn’t like the package of that sim, 
so that’s why.
[1804.32] Okay, anyway, Afnan, leave all this,
 where are you?
[1807.28] I have come for so many days,
 you didn’t meet me once.
[1809.60] I didn’t have this number of yours saved.
[1812.04] Okay, how is your shoot going?
You came here for a shoot, right?
[1817.80] Shoot.
[1819.20] The shoot has still not started.
 I am free.
[1824.24] So where, 
which hotel are you staying in?
[1826.88] Hotel?
[1828.32] No, no, I am in no hotel. 
I am staying at the director’s home.
[1832.84] Director’s home?
[1834.68] Are you not uneasy there?
[1836.84] Anyway,
[1838.52] I am busy for the next two to three days,
 I will tell you when I am free.
[1842.20] I am going for a meeting,
[1844.08] you called so I stopped 
the car answered your call.
[1846.40] No, no, no, you meet me today.
[1848.72] I have been here for so many days. 
Afnan, I am bored.
[1850.92] You meet me today,
 I will get ready quickly.
[1853.96] Hello?
[1855.80] Afnan?
[1862.80] He cuts the call on my face.
[1877.96] Sister in law, if anyone asks you about Ramsha,
[1881.12] then you tell them clearly that
 she went to her aunt’s home in Nawabshah.
[1887.32] For how long, Salma?
[1890.24] How long do we lie to people?
[1893.44] I don’t know sister in law.
[1896.52] I don’t know what else this time will show us.
[1899.88] Even Nabeel’s family called.
[1903.20] They were asking about the engagement.
[1904.88] I didn’t understand anything,
[1906.28] I just made an excuse that Ramsha 
went to Nawabshah to her aunt’s home,
[1909.80] still they were insisting 
that as soon as Ramsha comes,
[1913.40] they will come immediately
 for the engagement.
[1915.48] Sister in law, I didn’t understand anything,
 I just made an excuse.
[1918.56] Look Salma,
[1920.40] you tell them that we don’t plan 
getting her engaged right now.
[1925.44] I am unable to think myself.
[1928.68] I don’t understand anything.
[1929.84] You somehow say no to the engagement,
[1932.60] that we cannot do anything.
[1934.20] Say anything.
[1935.68] Okay, I will talk to them don’t worry.
[1939.00] Salma,
[1941.12] if they say that they want to talk to me,
[1945.44] then tell them I am unwell.
[1949.12] Make an excuse. I cannot talk.
[1953.76] What will I talk about?
[1957.12] What do I do?
[1965.76] Oh God.
[1968.48] Annie.
[1970.12] Yes, elder mama, all okay?
[1973.00] Yes.
[1975.04] I want to talk to you.
[1980.00] Yes?
[1981.76] Look Annie,
[1984.52] whatever we talk about it 
will be limited to this room...
[1991.24] ...and whatever I find out from you,
[1993.64] I will not say anything to anyone, 
that I found out from you.
[1997.44] I will not tell anyone anything.
[2001.96] If you mean Ramsha and you want to
 know something about Ramsha,
[2008.20] then I have already told you.
[2013.48] I know nothing.
[2016.68] How do you not know anything?
[2019.20] You are her cousin.
[2021.40] Not just her cousin,
 you are her best friend too.
[2024.56] How can I believe that 
she didn’t say anything to you.
[2028.32] She used to share everything with you.
[2033.60] Do you not feel any 
sympathy towards me?
[2037.72] The one standing in front 
of you is such a helpless mother,
[2042.52] who knows nothing about her daughter.
[2045.68] I don’t know 
what condition my daughter is in.
[2049.24] thinking about her, I have not been 
able to sleep for a moment, even.
[2054.44] I stay awake for her all night long.
[2056.96] I don’t know where my daughter is,
 if she is safe or not.
[2064.16] Look here, I beg you.
[2067.76] I beg you,
[2069.84] Annie, if you know anything about her, 
child, please, for God’s sake, tell me,
[2074.00] I wont say anything.
[2075.80] I wont tell anyone that you
 told me anything. Please, child.
[2080.12] Don’t embarrass me elder mama,
 you please sit.
[2089.04] Elder mama,
[2090.52] I am speaking the truth,
[2093.12] I know nothing where Ramsha is.
[2102.52] Okay child.
[2107.52] Elder mama,
[2112.40] Ramsha used to like a boy named Afnan.
[2148.68] Sir, I…
[2151.72] I…actually, I wanted 
if you give me the script,
[2155.24] I am free all day long, 
so I will read the script.
[2157.56] I will also check the type of character it is.
[2161.88] Why are you worried about the script?
[2165.92] Don’t worry.
[2168.36] Come, sit here.
[2171.68] Sure.
[2179.24] Why did you sit there?
[2184.36] Come sit here with me.
[2186.68] I will not eat you.
