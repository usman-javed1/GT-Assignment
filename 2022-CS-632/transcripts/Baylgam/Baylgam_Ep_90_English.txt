Hi Alizay.
Hi. How are you?
I am fine. You tell me. Did you come alone? 
Didn’t aunt Afsheen come? Man, mama is at home, 
I came directly from the office. Okay, come on, let’s go. Come. Ramsha. You know her? Yes. How are you? Ramsha, you are here? Do you live here? Yes. How is Adeel? 
Is he taking care of you? You people talk, I will go inform mama.
Okay. Ramsha, I had to give you good news. I am expecting. The reason for telling you is that whether Adeel cares for you or not, you cannot come back to our home. After all, you are divorced and even after your divorce he is taking
 so much care of you. He married you. It is also your responsibility to ensure 
that your home remains. Look, the relation between me and 
Afnan is going to get stronger, there is no place for a third person. You understand what I am saying, right? Hey, you people are still standing here? Come on. Come upstairs.
Yes. Okay, take care. Afnan, you took long to come 
from the office today. Yes, aunt, I have a lot of work in the office,
 that is why I get late. Yes, I can understand. After brother left, you have managed 
the office, home, everything well. Mama, I forgot to tell you. 
I met Ramsha today. Should I bring water?
Water… No, no, it is okay. where did you meet Ramsha? I went to meet my friend, she lives in her apartments 
with her husband. yes, but Afnan had said she lives
 in a neighbourhood. Yes, that’s what I knew about Adeel 
that he lives at such a place. No. No. I think she must be lying. She must work there, 
somewhere in an apartment. She spoke this lie to save her respect. No, mama, had I not seen her 
with my own eyes then I would have thought 
that she is lying. But, really, her entire attire 
was changed. She looked really different. She had a branded bag in her hands, 
she was wearing good shoes, she was looking really proper. I am surprised how she got 
so much money. I remember, her husband had 
some ordinary job. In fact, he was in your office, right? Huh? Adeel. No, when he got married, 
he quit the job right after that. And after all aunt, times have become so fast nowadays, you never know when someone’s 
condition would change. What can we say, no? Yes, you are right. I will have to admit one thing, Ramsha had really good fate. Afnan, whatever Alizay did was wrong, I know. I have scolded her a lot. And she is really embarrassed 
on what she did. Afnan, I know Alizay is really 
short tempered, but she is good at heart. Fine, I will go now. Who is that girl? Alizay was saying that 
you have an affair with her. Is this true? What? Alizay saw you? Ramsha… if you had seen Alizay earlier, 
then why did you go to her? What was the need for you to go,
 Ramsha? I didn’t see her Afnan. How was I 
to know I will see her suddenly and she saw me and 
she stopped me. A friend of her lives here. But I am worried that Alizay shouldn’t have seen you
at this time and in this condition. I didn’t do anything on purpose. I cannot even think of worrying you, and after all, Alizay seeing me here 
was a coincidence. She feels that 
I am married to Adeel. You don’t worry, 
nothing will happen. I… in fact, I will be careful 
going out again. You try not to step out 
for a few days. Look, I am not saying this with reference
 to be cruel or do injustice with you. I just want to say that avoid 
going out for a few days. I am scared that Alizay 
may have had a doubt. Fine, as you order. 
As you say. No, it is not about my order, 
understand what I am saying. Alizay is pregnant right now, the doctors have said that 
she cannot take any form of stress. If it was the normal circumstances, I wouldn’t have feared that 
you and I are married. But if I tell her this
 in this condition, and if God forbid something happens, we will never be able to forgive 
each other all our lives. You understand what I am saying, right? Good. This is the smartness 
I expected from you. Come on, I will go now.
Wont you stay? I am sorry, but, because of Alizay’s health, 
I will have to live there for a few days. Fine. Goodbye. I feel embarrassed looking you 
in the eyes, and how can I live with Alizay? I have no respect or place 
in her eyes. If I tell you the truth, maybe, she wants to live with me out
 of your stubbornness and not her love. She thinks if I choose you over her, 
then her ego will be hurt. You cannot imagine how much 
she misbehaved with me. I only tolerated her 
because of aunt. If there was someone 
else in my place, they would have removed her 
from their lives right there. Ramsha. You know her? Yes. How are you? Ramsha, you are here? Do you live here? Yes. How is Adeel? Is he taking care of you? You people talk, I will go inform mama.
Okay. Ramsha, I had to give you 
good news. I am expecting. The reason for telling you is that whether Adeel cares for you or not, you cannot come back to our home. After all, you are divorced and even after your divorce he is taking 
so much care of you. He married you. It is also your responsibility to ensure 
that your home remains. Look, the relation between me and 
Afnan is going to get stronger, there is no place for a third person. You understand what I am saying, right? At times nature changes your life and decisions in an instant. I went to tell Alizay that 
I cannot live with her now, but… but that one moment 
changed my life. Maybe nature wants that 
I stay with Alizay. You know well, Ramsha, I really desire a child. Now I cannot leave Alizay. I cannot take her out of my life. Oh God, what test have you put me in. I will pray. My Lord, don’t put that burden on me, 
that I cannot lift. I am really weak. I don’t have the courage. Without a doubt, you have control over everything, no one can help more than 
You in this world. Help me. Save me from humiliation 
and insult. Help me. Alizay. Alizay. Yes. Good morning. Good morning,
 where are you going? I am going to the office. Office? Yes. Alizay, you shouldn’t go to the office
in this condition. Why? You are reacting like today
is my first day and I am going to the office 
for the first time. You know, I have been getting calls 
from the office for so long, I have gotten late today. Okay fine. You do one thing, 
go to the office today and handover all your responsibilities
to someone else and tell your boss that 
you are going on leaves. Why should I give an application 
for leaves? Look Alizay, I am telling you again and again, 
you need to care for your health. You shouldn’t do such rigorous work
in this condition. Afnan, I am not ill that I sit at home. I am pregnant and 
pregnant women work. Yes, Alizay, women work, but it is your first pregnancy. You don’t know your condition. I will have to go to the office 
in a little while, God forbid, if you get unwell, 
then what will we do? You please don’t go to the office today or if you are going, then listen to me,
 and get a leave and come back. You are not doing this job for money, that it is really necessary 
for you to do this job. When did I say I am doing this 
for money, Afnan? I didn’t mean that. I am just telling you that you please leave your job 
for the time being. Just take a leave. That’s it. Alizay, I am just saying all this 
because I care for you. Afnan, I am really happy to hear this 
that you care for me so much. But sorry, I cannot take 
a leave right now. I am sorry. Alizay, please. You know, I have thought a lot 
about our relation. Whatever happened since 
marriage till today, about that. I feel that we fight, argue, we think negative about each other, it is only because we are not able to give time 
to anything else. We just point out each other’s mistakes, we are misled about each other. But I am sure, once my child comes in between us, all our worries, all our attention will only be for him. And you will see, the way I suddenly get angry, 
it will all get fine. I will take a lot of care of our child. Afnan, I don’t want to argue with you. And if talk on this topic more, then we will argue and
then we will fight. So it is better that 
we close this topic. I am not ready right now. What do I do? Should I call Afnan or not? Ramsha, how many times 
have I told you, you wont call on my number, 
I will call myself. Sorry Afnan, I didn’t want to call you. Then what happened that
 you had to call? Afnan, I am not well. 
I am really unwell. What happened to you?
You are fine. I don’t know I have a really high fever. Okay fine. Fine, I will come. Fine, you come soon. You don’t worry, 
I am coming immediately. Okay. Okay bye. Nothing to worry about, Mr. Afnan. It is seasonal fever, you just 
give her medication on time, she will be fine soon. Thank you, doctor. Come, 
I will see you off. Ramsha. Hey, I brought soup for you. Hey, move this from here. Mama, I had told you 
I don’t want to drink soup. I don’t want to have soup. Why don’t you want to have soup, 
child? You are not well. You have not eaten anything. You will get unwell further like this. Have some soup, then 
I will bring medication for you. Come on, come..
Mama, neither do I want to have the medication,
nor do I want to drink or eat something. You leave, please let me sleep 
for a while. Hey, how can I like that? 
Did you see? She is not eating or 
drinking anything. Hey, when she eats or drinks something,
then I will give her, her medication. Make her understand.
Hey, your mother is right. If you don’t eat something, 
then how will you get fine? Quickly have soup. Come on. I had even told mama that 
I don’t want to have soup, still she made it and brought it. Stay here tonight. Ramsha, I wont be able 
to stay today. Alizay’s condition is not good. I cannot leave her alone 
in this condition. If the condition was normal, 
I would have stayed, but… But what? But I want that Alizay stay happy till 
the time our child doesn’t come to this world. What happened? 
What are you thinking? Nothing. Ramsha, don’t be sad. Do you not believe my love? Ramsha, I love you a lot. Believe me. I believe your love, that is why 
I married you. I wish. I wish I had believed your love earlier. Then we would have had 
to face all this today. No problem, Afnan. Maybe meeting like this was 
written in our fate. You know I feel really sorry 
seeing you. In fact I am more sad than sorry. You didn’t care for my sister. Ramsha loved you so much, she was so sincere with you. You didn’t believe her. I know, she was naïve, 
I know she was emotional, but she was mad for you. Earning money in showbiz, being famous was her passion, but you were more than her passion. Mr. Afnan, every girl who lives for her wishes, one who has the wish to live 
in open air is not cheap. Such girls just follow 
wrong advice of people, but believe me, it is not impossible for them to return. But we? We don’t leave the door 
for them to return. We don’t give them the chance
to come back, and you did the same. You did the same with Ramsha. You didn’t understand Ramsha. Okay, anyway, leave it. I will make good tea for you. Then you also have to take 
your medication. Okay? You see yourself, 
you are alone here, what could have happened with you? You think yourself. You were so unwell, you were completely alone, 
your friend was not with you either. God forbid, had something 
happened to you, then? What would the family 
would have done? They would have also brought me 
to the hospital, you brought me here. Man, you know what your biggest problem is? You don’t understand things. Okay, don’t scold me. I am so unwell and 
then you are scolding me. Look, when am I telling you 
to quit your job? I am just saying you take leaves 
for some time from the office. Afnan, neither can I quit my job right now,
nor can I take leaves. You know right now my job 
is really important. And your health? It is important too,
you have to take care of that. What happened to me? Why are you and 
mama always after me? Hey man, whatever we are saying is in your care. Come on, Afnan. I am not a child. I can take care of myself. You are a child. Such a child, who gets stuck
 on her insistence. Who doesn’t listen to anyone 
apart from her. What is wrong with you? Why are you getting 
so angry nowadays? When am I getting angry? I am telling you to take care of yourself and you are saying I am getting 
angry with you. I mean, earlier you didn’t care 
for me this much. Why do you have so much love 
for me suddenly? Are you doing all this because 
we are going to have a child? Whatever you think is right. Anyway, I like you caring 
for me like this. Look, if you leave your office, 
I too will like it. Afnan, shall we talk about this later? Please. Fine. As you wish. You just came back from 
the hospital a little while back, now you are going back 
to the hospital? Afnan, since uncle has been 
hospitalized, you are not giving me time. You are so indifferent. My father is fighting between life 
and death in the hospital and here you are concerned 
about yourself. Afnan, maybe you are forgetting, uncle is admitted in the hospital
because of your beloved.
