With great difficulty, I spoke to her sister, my Bani. You should have told them that Dua is no more in this world. What do you think? I would not have told them. This is what I told them first. You know what her parents told me, that Dua has died for us a long time ago. Whatever happens to her, it doesn't matter to them. [Music] The dead body has to be handed over. You call her family. Sorry ma'am, nobody is actually ready to receive the dead body. The dead body is not in a condition to be kept here any more. Anyway, this case is not new for us. And if we look at it, then their parents are also not at fault. In life, these people do not like to live with their parents and with their restrictions. And after death, their parents also do not accept them. Okay, we hand over such unclaimed bodies to the police. For this, some legal action will be taken and a form will have to be filled. One of you should come with me. Your signatures will be needed.
