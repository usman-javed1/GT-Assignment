Greetings. Greetings. How are you? I am fine. You went to the doctor, 
what happened? The same routine stuff. Take care of your diet and all that. But yes, the doctor has said that I will have to go for 
an ultrasound next week. Okay. Fine. Afnan, now that you are here, 
should I have food served? Yes, aunt, have the food served and also call Ramsha, we will have food together. Ramsha is not at home, she has been gone 
since the afternoon. Where did Ramsha go? I don’t know. In fact, I thought maybe she would have told 
you and gone. No, no, she didn’t inform me and go. Greetings. Greetings. Where did you go? I went to uncle’s home. Uncle had an accident. I called you a lot, but you didn’t answer it. I left after telling aunt so 
that she informs you. Aunt, did you not tell him? When did you tell me? Hey, you please keep me
 away from these matters. Aunt, I had told you before leaving. And I had also said that Afnan isn’t answering his phone… how do you lie so easily? Ramsha. Ramsha, what is wrong with you? How are you talking to aunt? Does she not know how 
to talk with respect? How was she talking to mama? And you are standing there 
quietly and seeing it? I did scold her. Now should I kill her? Do you call this scolding? I saw how you scolded her. Come on, mama. In what tone did you 
talk to aunt today? I am seeing that day by day you are becoming really 
rude and disrespectful. Afnan, aunt is lying. She has always 
done this with me. It is all my fault, I shouldn’t have trusted aunt. You want that I care
 about a woman, who has only done bad with me. She got me kidnapped, she put allegations on me. She humiliated me in
 front of everyone, and you want that I clear
 my heart towards her. I forget everything, Afnan? Look Ramsha, every person changes themselves. Aunt too has changed. I think you should forget the past and start new. You should clean your 
heart towards her. Afnan, if you want to clean your
 heart towards her, then you do it. I don’t want it. After all, if aunt has changed, then she has only changed for you. For me, she is still the same. She has the same poison for 
me in her heart like earlier. I have always tolerated 
her injustice. But now, I will not tolerate all this, Afnan. Whatever it is Ramsha, aunt is the elder of this family and you should respect 
her because of this. I shouldn’t see you misbehaving
 with her after today, or it wont be good. I am so sorry aunt. I am so sorry. Watch where you are going. Where are you going 
in such a hurry? Where are you going? Uncle had an accident, Annie called. I have been calling Afnan for so long, but he is not answering, so I am going myself. Aunt, as soon as Afnan, you tell him I went to uncle’s home. Yes, yes, I will tell him. Aunt, please tell him or else he will worry. Obviously, what is there to forget in this, you go without worrying. Okay fine. Thank you. Bye. Nothing more can happen apart
 from what has happened. I am only disappointed that we are getting married 
because of that stain you have put on my character and
 not out of our love. I will have to live up to this relation 
because of all that happened. I have no fault in all 
that has happened. Why don’t you understand, 
Afnan? Whatever happened,
 shouldn’t have happened but from today, 
you are my respect. I will try that at least this time you are not 
able to tarnish my respect. Whatever I did with 
you was wrong. Oh wow, it is good that you realized it. Did you not realize it soon, Shani? But you know, now this realization is 
of no use for you, nor is it of any use for me. That’s why it is better that you bury this 
realization inside you. I regret losing you. You know Shani, when you don’t realize on time, then just like that,regret and sorrow. What nonsense is this? A mother really worries for their child. A mother really cares for her child. You don’t realize it today, one day when you become a father, when your own child is unwell, that when you will realize what taking care of a child is like. Come on, now here, have the soup. Drink it. I am just drinking it for you. Show me. I am making you drink it. Oh. Listen. Now that you have brought it, make me wear it too. Please. Okay. Now give me the other one. Yes. It looks nice. I mean that, look, you are worried there too, you are not well. You must have issues
 moving around and I am little worried here, I cannot find my things, so I will come. Yes, but who told you that I am worried here? I am absolutely fine. I didn’t come to stay at uncle’s 
home for the first time. I have spent a long time here. So you don’t worry about me. Yes, if you don’t like it there, and you want that I come there, then say that. No, no, there is nothing like that. I like it here. I really like it here. In fact, today the room
 is really peaceful and I will sleep peacefully. Really? Then sleep peacefully. Hello. Ramsha. Why did you call so late at night,
 Shani? Ramsha, listen to me. I cannot find peace. Please forgive me. My heart cannot find peace. Have you lost your mind, Shani? Did you call me so late at night
 to talk this nonsense? Yes. I am…I am sorry, I shouldn’t have called at this time. Who are you talking to? Afnan… Don’t lie to me. You know, aunt is right about you. Girls like you are not worth trusting. I had lost my mind that I came upstairs to see if
 injustice is being done to you, are you crying? But it is good that I came, at least my eyes have 
been opened. What are you saying Afnan? There is nothing like that. You are thinking wrong. You listen… I am thinking wrong? Me, Ramsha? Hey, you don’t want to understand. I am taking so much pain for you, I am trying to make you 
understand with love, but you? Girls like you cannot 
understand anything, ever. You do what you want to. No Afnan, there is nothing like that. You listen to me… I don’t want to hear you, Ramsha. You know, having hopes from you is wrong. Hey, it is my fault. It is my mistake, that I thought, you will change your ways, you will come back to me, but no. The one who has looked away, you can stop their way, but you cannot change
 their direction. You want to go to your
 uncle’s home, right? You find peace and
 comfort there. Come on. Come, 
I will take you there. There is nothing like that, 
Afnan, you… Don’t be unjust with me, 
come on. Come. Afnan, what are you doing? Oh yes, I forgot. You will not go there for one day. Now you will have to go permanently. So your bags should be packed too. Come on, tell me, should I pack your bags 
or will you do it? Afnan listen to me. You wont agree like this. You are being cunning again. I will pack your bags. Afnan, there is nothing like that. What is wrong with you, Afnan? Afnan, listen… Go from here. Everyone will see. Leave. Why are you acting so pure? Huh? Have you forgotten your past? I knew it. I was well aware of you
 being a low life. Yes, I am a lowlife. You recognized me correctly. And after marriage you
 will realize that I am not just a lowlife, I am also really cheap. Because I remember 
every single thing and I will take revenge for 
everything one by one. What did they call you? Shopping girl. The fish is the queen of the water, her life is in the water. If you touch her, she will get scared. If you take her out, she will die. You know what? I used to think in childhood
 what this means, I understood it, today. Your wedding gift. This was your wedding gift. Sit. Sit. Hey. Hey. Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama. Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama. Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama. You people are not listening to me. Listen… stop it! Now I will not hear a word and no one will listen to her here. I will not tolerate you in 
my life for a moment, and I… Shani listen to me. Ramsha, I divorce you. I divorce you. I divorce you. Come on, get off the car. Forgive me once. Afnan, it will not happen again. I am accepting my mistake and I am apologizing to you too. You didn’t make a mistake, you committed a sin. Cheating your husband is a sin. Afnan, if a person is embarrassed 
on what they did, then even God forgives them. Forgive me, please, Afnan. God is really merciful to His servants. A man is not that great. You pray that, God makes my heart 
soft towards you. But right now, I have no 
room for you in my heart. Afnan. Here, have tea. And you stop having too much tea, your diabetes will increase. Hmmm. Who is here at this hour? I don’t know. I will see. Ramsha. Greetings. Greetings. You came alone? No Afnan dropped me. Actually, he is going abroad. Yes. and it will take him some time
 to come back as well. So he said I should come and stay 
with you people here. Ramsha. Greetings. Greetings. Child, all okay, you are here at this hour? And where is Afnan? No Afnan, dropped me and went. Actually, he has a flight, he has to go. He is going abroad. So he said I should stay with you people 
for a few days. Okay. Okay. Annie, take your sister to the room. Come, Ramsha.
