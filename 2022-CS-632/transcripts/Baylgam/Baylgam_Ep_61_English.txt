Anwer, tea. Did you talk to Ramsha? What could I talk about? Did you not see how 
badly she was crying? Her crying in this 
condition is not good. But your son doesn’t 
understand it. I don’t understand 
myself what to do. I don’t believe all this. Brother Qasim’s son is 
really sober and smart. I feel Shani is putting
 an allegation. Why? Why would Shani do this? How would I know? You ask Shani. He is putting an allegation on her. Shani cannot be that mad. He must have surely
 seen something, he must have heard something. I agree, that Shani is a little mad. But he is not that mad. You tell me yourself, what do you think? What is the need for
 madam Alizeh to lie? Huh? I don’t know Anwer, but my heart is not ready
 to accept this. I agree that Ramsha was wild, she used to make videos
 from her mobile, she would frankly talk to her friends, she was always on her phone, but that Afnan seems
 like a smart boy. And if I tell you the truth Anwer, I feel that, that Alizeh wants that Ramsha 
has no relation with that home. Whenever I go, brother Qasim meets nicely, but Alizeh and her mother, have a cold behaviour towards us. Fine, okay, whatever you say, I believe you. I believe it that Alizeh doesn’t like
 Ramsha staying in that home, then does that means, Alizeh would lie, 
but an allegation on her? No, no, that’s not how it is madam Salma. 
That’s not how it. No one blames anyone like this. There is surely some
 truth behind things. I don’t know. There is surely some truth behind it. No one blames anyone like this. Hey, dad, you are here. I even went to your room and ask, but… did Ramsha give you 
your medication? I took my medication. Ramsha is not there, she left at night. This means she left 
cause of Alizeh. Ramsha took the 
right decision that she left from here and
 she told me and went. She is not nonserious like you. She is a smart child. She understood the need
 of the situation and she did what 
was better for her. Ramsha is smart, dad. I wish your daughter-in-law
 was that smart too. Then I wouldn’t have had 
to see this day today. I too would have had 
peace in my life. Alizeh, Afnan was sleeping in the lounge. Please mama, now don’t say that he was sleeping
 in the lounge because of me. He was not sleeping 
there by his will, I didn’t say anything to him. Alizeh, I don’t understand how this relation will 
move forward, how will it be strong? You don’t agree to stepping back, nor is he ready to agree. Child to live in a relation, you have to show flexibility, not stubbornness. I am surprised mama, even after all that happened, you are thinking I am wrong. Have you forgotten what
 Afnan has done? No, child, I didn’t forget anything, I remember it all. Then how can you take his side? I am not taking his side, I am worried for you because you are my only daughter. I don’t want you to face any sorrow. I just want that you 
stay happy, child. I too want to stay happy, mama, but now I have no
 happiness with Afnan. I can never stay happy with him. Don’t say that Alizeh. How many times have
 I told you that you think several times 
before talking. I think? I have done all that I had to
 think about and understand. Now Afnan has to think 
and understand. Mama, he has hurt my heart, he has left my heart. No Alizeh, don’t say that. Afnan is your husband. Child, you should be thankful that you have your husband’s 
shade on you. Someone should ask me what
 a life without a husband is. Who knows it better than me? I am getting late. I am leaving. Is Afnan in the office? Yes, who are you? Excuse me. Fine, you email these documents. Stop. I am telling you… In this, all… Sorry sir, I tried hard to stop him, but he came inside forcefully. It is okay. Mr. Tariq, you please leave. You… Okay, sir. You did good that you sent 
your servants away. You know I wouldn’t even have
 liked myself had I insulted you
 in front of them. What nonsense is this? Is this the way to 
come to the office, to talk? Yes, you are right. Actually, I should break your 
face for what you have done. Look Shani, I don’t want to do anything
 like this, but you are forcing me that 
I call my guard.. No, not just the guard, call all your other employees, call your secretary from outside. In fact, call everyone in this room, so that they know 
what you are up to, and what you are doing, and what your relation 
has been with my wife. You know who told me all this? Your wife. Now I want that 
I divorce Ramsha. No, no, Shani, 
what is wrong with you? You try and understand. Think with a cool mind. Ramsha and I have no relation, you have a big 
misunderstanding, man. After all, Ramsha is really sad, if you do something like this, then she won’t be able
 to take the shock. Don’t do anything like this,
 please. You are more worried 
about my wife, than me. Good. But you know what? You understand one thing today. I know well what I have to do 
with my wife and what not. But it would be better that 
you stay away from her. I am explaining this to 
you for the last time. Shani. I want to talk to you. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything, go from here. I don’t even want to see your face. Listen to me, once. Please. I don’t want to hear your nonsense. I told you to leave. Shani, let me clarify once. Give me one chance. Listen to me. Believe me, I have no place for
 Afnan in my heart, I have no love for him in my heart. Only you are in my heart. You are a liar, do you understand? You deceived me. I didn’t lie about anything, nor did I deceive you. You didn’t lie to me? Then where did Afnan come from? Did you not hide your past from me? Don’t lie, you are a liar. Whatever was between
 Afnan and I is in the past, that ended a long time 
before the marriage. There was nothing to tell you, so what would I have told you? Stop it, Ramsha. Love never ends and you used to love him. Believe me a little. Fine, if you don’t believe me, then at least believe 
what Afnan told you. You know uncle’s 
environment is not like that, he didn’t bring Afnan 
up in this manner. Afnan, where were you? What did you do? what did I do? Don’t lie to me, because Shani came 
to my office today. Alizeh, you have done 
something really cheap. You told Shani everything 
about Ramsha and I. Afnan, you had told me there is nothing between 
you and Ramsha that you want to hide. When everything is 
clear between you two, then what are you scared about? I cannot believe that I had loved a low life like you. I am disappointed with myself. Afsheen, you don’t worry. I think we should give
 those two sometime, everything will be fine. I pray to God brother, that what you are saying happens. I believe that if someone 
does no wrong to anyone, nothing wrong happens with them. It is time for test, it will pass. Sir, madam Ramsha’s family is here. Yes, yes, call them. Okay. Greetings. Hey. Come. Come. Greetings. You people are here suddenly. You should have told 
me earlier, informed me, actually, I have a really
 important meeting. Mr. Qasim, even we too want to 
ask you some important things. You have a seat. Sit. What did you do, Alizeh? Shani’s family is sitting with
 brother downstairs. You must have understood it. You tell me what did you 
think doing this, answer me. I mean, you told Shani
 about Afnan and Ramsha, huh? The fire will not be 
limited to Ramsha, it will burn your relation with Afnan. Idiot, you should have taken
 my advice before doing anything. What will brother think about you? What do you think? Afnan will have love for 
you in his heart? Not at all. I am asking you something, 
answer me. So what could I do? I was angry with Ramsha, I did what I thought was right. Alizeh, I am tired of 
making you understand. One problem doesn’t end and you create another issue. What will brother think about my upbringing of you. This is the limit. Tabassum, what is going on here? It is madam Ramsha’s birthday. So who got this decoration done? Mr. Afnan got it done. Here, keep it inside. Take this too. Hey, you people are here. Afnan, you got all this 
decoration done? Yes, I had to do everything urgently. It is Ramsha’s birthday and dad had specially said that the arrangement of her 
birthday should be done well. Dad was saying that 
I invite all her family, but I only invited Shani 
and Annie. Yes, you did good. 
You did really good. Aunt, you think yourself, she serves dad so much. I mean, she doesn’t 
sit for a second. She also cares for 
all of a lot too. She doesn’t leave 
anything in his care. Now we can do this much
 for her happiness. Come on, we will cut the cake. They are all waiting. Fix your mood, please. What are you doing? 
What has happened? I should give you a medal, right? Shani, what has happened? Shani. What is this? what is going on? what is this noise about? What is this? You are a cheater. You cheated me, 
you cheated all of us. Whatever was between 
Afnan and I is in the past, that ended a long
 time before the marriage. There was nothing to tell you, so what would I have told you? Stop it, Ramsha. Love never ends and you used to love him. Afnan, listen to me. Afnan, I am saying 
something to you. What is wrong with you? Why are you ignoring me? Don’t be mad. Look, listen to me carefully. If you think that the world 
operates on your orders. What you say will happen and you will stop whoever 
you want, they will stop, then that is not true. I have been tolerating you
 for a long time, but don’t consider
 it my weakness, it is my helplessness. Why don’t you 
speak the truth? You cannot tolerate that your lover’s husband 
is insulting her, humiliating her, only
 because of your love. Shut up. Just shut up. If you say another cheap thing, then I will say something, that our relation will end forever. Understand? Afnan, what are you saying? I am absolutely right, aunt. And instead of saying 
anything to me, make your daughter understand. If she bothers me like this, then she won’t be part of my life. Alizeh, what is all this? Wow, man. How are you? You have changed completely
 in year or two. A car and everything. Amazing. This is great. I am surprised to see you. Hey, Shani, this is
 earning from abroad. Look, I would say that instead 
of working hard here, work hard abroad. It is truly silver. Silver. You look at me, how long was
 I gone to Dubai for? Just two years. I got a home and this
 great car in that time. That’s what I am seeing, you did everything so soon. I would say you too come to Dubai, my cousin has a superstore in Dubai. Yes, it will cost a small sum, but you will earn millions. You have a good plan, 
but how will I go? I don’t have money. The shop’s condition 
is in front of you, you know about it. How will I spend so much? Take a loan from someone. Who will give me a loan? My family is full of poor people. You must have someone. Relative, friend, cousin. Do you have no one? Hey, in-laws, your in-laws? What are you thinking about? Listen, what will you eat? Hey, I won’t eat here, come, I will feed you food at a five 
star restaurant. Come on. Come on, come. Come. How long will we sit at 
the roadside café for? Listen. Yes? Can I drive? Yes? Sir, he wants to talk to you. Yes, greetings. Greetings. Who is this? Hey, you forgot me so soon. You know, I am surprised I had thought that the 
relation we have formed, after that you won’t 
forget me so soon. Anyway, this is Shani. What do they say? 
Your enemy. What are you doing here? Look, if I talk about all this here, it won’t look nice. Even your staff is here, I don’t think you will like it. Because I feel that these secrets should be discussed face to face. What do you think? Fine, let me talk to him. Let him come inside. Yes, okay sir. You can go. Why did you come here? Look, listen to me carefully, I have no contact with Ramsha. That is why there is some reason
 for which you came here. Tell me what do you want? You have no contact? But you have a relation, right? But I don’t understand
 this relation, because you had a relation. Right? And this is still fixed in 
my heart and mind. I cannot forget this. This means you need 
mental treatment. Yes, I have a need, but right now 
I need something else. And you are a really smart man. Because keeping 
a girl like Ramsha in control is something 
a smart person can do. The thing is that I need five million rupees. What? Five million? What will you do with such 
a big sum of money? Now see when you met 
Ramsha at our home that day, I realized that you really
 worry for her right now. And you are aware of her 
condition too. Now if something bad happens
 when traveling on a bike, it won’t be nice. So that’s why I am thinking 
I will get a car for her. What do you think? And you know that things have become so expensive
 that this is how much a car costs. I don’t have this much money. Mr. Afnan, say things that one understands. I don’t understand that 
you don’t have money? I understand everything 
you are saying, Shani? I think you don’t understand me. I cannot give you this much money, so it better that you leave from here. Yes? Fine. Hey. Err…. Alizeh, I had told you not to do all this. Today, Afnan spoke to me
 like this for the first time. If you were smart, then Afnan would never
 have said this to me. What does Afnan
 think of himself? What does he think, if he leaves me then 
I will be ruined? This will not happen at all. He is mistaken. I can do everything myself. What can you do? And what will you do?
 I too should find out. Only because you earn, does that mean that you
 will do everything? Alizeh, if brother and Afnan 
leave our life, then we will have
 nothing in our life. Needs a fulfilled with a job, not wishes. And the life you have
 gotten used to, these luxuries, you will never get them from a job, you are mistaken. Okay, please mama, I know all this. I am not a child. You are right. You understand it all, but you never learned to 
compromise in your life. Because brother didn’t 
let you lack anything. What would you know what killing your wishes is like? You agree to this, that you too are used
 to these luxuries. So, it would be better that neither do you put 
yourself in this test, nor do you put me in the test. Shani, you come 
early from the shop. We have to take Ramsha to
 the hospital for a checkup. I cannot take her, 
you take her along. Why? Why should I take her? She is your wife,
 she is your responsibility. You take her. She didn’t go to the hospital
 last month for a check-up. Mama, I have to go do something
 important after the shop, I cannot come early. Is anything more important to 
you than your wife and child? Her checkup didn’t 
get done last month. It is really necessary for her 
to get a checkup this month. Come early, understand? Everyone can force 
themselves on me only. They have made it a joke. Ramsha, come on. I am coming, just wait a minute. We are not going to a wedding, we have to go to the hospital, come on. Come on. I am so sorry. You think it is a joke, you have made me
 your servant. I couldn’t find my bag. Come on. Sit. Sit. Hey. Hey, Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama. Ramsha. Ramsha… Mama. Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama. I don’t understand how she fell. You didn’t even go 
a little far from home and you made her fall. What do you mean? You think that I made 
Ramsha fall on purpose? Shani, the way you take out your 
anger on her nowadays, we can expect anything from you. You know, this is the limit. Meaning, I will make her fall even 
after knowing her condition and what will I get out of it? How would I know what you will get? But you should have seen if she had sat on the bike or not? She didn’t sit, and you started 
the bike and made her fall.
