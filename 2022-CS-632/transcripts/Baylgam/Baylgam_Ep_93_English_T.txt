[55.80] Ramsha?
[58.08] Ramsha, please listen to me, 
Ramsha?
[60.24] Ramsha, open the door, please.
[66.28] Ramsha, I know this is wrong with you 
but what should I do? I am helpless.
[72.64] Ramsha?
[81.68] Okay,
[83.48] don’t open the door,
[85.80] I am a fool to be making 
so much effort.
[88.16] I am leaving. Bye.
[106.24] Greetings, brother Jamshed,
[107.80] you here at this time? 
Is everything okay?
[110.04] Madam Ramsha, that Afnan…
[114.68] Sir Afnan had an accident.
[119.12] What? How?
[121.96] I have just got a call from home, 
his car met an accident.
[286.32] Madam Ramsha?
[291.08] Madam Ramsha?
[312.20] Hello? 
Hello, brother Jamshed,
[315.64] Madam Ramsha is not home, 
has she gone somewhere?
[317.92] I have been ringing her doorbell for 
so long she is not opening the door.
[321.00] No, no, she is at home, 
you ring the doorbell again.
[326.08] Okay I will ring the doorbell again 
and see,
[328.20] I will also wait for a while, she might be 
in the washroom.
[330.56] Okay fine, bye.
[339.04] Madam Ramsha?
[376.76] What happened? 
You are still standing here,
[379.28] did Madam Ramsha not 
open the door yet?
[381.32] No she is not opening the door, 
I have been standing here for so long.
[390.52] Brother Jamshed, I think there is 
something wrong.
[396.48] Do one thing, call Sir Afnan.
[399.84] Yes, right.
[414.20] What happened? 
Is he not picking up?
[417.12] He is not well.
[418.76] Okay do one thing, a gatekeeper 
is sitting downstairs,
[421.64] you call him he might be able
to do something.
[423.76] Okay, don’t worry, Sir Afnan has 
given me a duplicate key of this flat.
[428.00] You are the limit, 
you thought of it so soon!
[430.44] Quickly open the door.
[442.24] Madam Ramsha?
[443.68] Madam Ramsha,
[445.40] Madam Ramsha, get up.
[515.32] Afnan, you don’t care about me at all,
[517.48] you didn’t even call me for 
once after going home,
[520.52] I kept on waiting for you all night, 
you didn’t call me at night either
[524.68] and now that it’s morning, 
now you have thought of me.
[529.32] I, actually, didn’t get time to call,
[532.72] and I had no idea you would 
take this to your heart.
[537.56] You actually had no idea how I 
would come back from there?
[541.52] Do you know I have never felt 
so lonely, Afnan.
[548.12] If Alizey is your wife,
[551.08] I am your wife too.
[553.84] Hey, when did I deny that?
[559.28] Okay at least stop crying, 
I am coming back, okay?
[580.28] Afnan, what happened?
[582.88] Do you need something?
[584.48] No, no, I just was just feeling weakness,
I guess because of that.
[588.80] Doctor has recommended
 bed rest to you,
[590.72] give me your phone here.
[592.52] What? But I need to make 
an important call.
[595.28] look Doctor has asked you 
to completely rest for now.
[605.48] In fact, let me do one thing, 
let me switch off this phone,
[617.32] you won’t have the phone and 
you won’t make any calls.
[621.00] And what about the office updates, 
Alizey?
[624.08] Afnan, all this can be done later too.
[631.56] Don’t do any work for now at all.
[638.52] Mr Ahmed at the office, 
I spoke to him in the morning,
[648.52] and he was saying whatever work 
will be there related to office,
[651.32] he will keep on updating me,
[652.76] I will let you know myself 
if there is anything important,
[655.04] so please don’t worry and 
you just rest.
[657.68] Yes, but there are some documents
[660.00] that I need to tell him where they are, 
he doesn’t know where they are.
[664.80] Afnan, I think you should just 
rest right now.
[677.48] Leave all this,
[678.84] nothing will be ruined, everything 
will be done on time, hmm?
[694.44] Do you have a headache too?
[706.12] So then please, rest.
[714.40] Sleep for a while,
[716.12] I have your phone with me, okay?
[742.28] I cannot live such a life,
[746.60] where every moment of life is a lie,
[752.04] this double life is very difficult to live.
[763.76] I married you and kept you here,
[770.84] kept you deprived of all your rights.
[780.20] I even feel embarrassed by 
making eye contact with you.
[792.08] You are regretting marrying me,
right?
[796.40] What are you saying?
[798.88] How can you even think that?
[802.32] If I regret anything, it is when
[805.28] I didn’t believe what you said,
[810.44] I wish,
[813.00] I wish I had believed you,
[816.64] I wouldn’t have to go through 
this trouble today.
[824.36] Now I feel that I have done 
a robbery or something
[831.08] that I am trying to hide by 
running away from people.
[847.96] I bother you a lot, right?
[851.68] I am not bothered by you but my life,
[855.28] no one is happy,
[858.44] no matter how hard I try
[863.36] someone is sad,
[866.68] look at Alizey,
[869.08] when I go to her, she fights, 
me gets angry and complain,
[874.16] I don’t know how to cater 
to her complaints.
[879.36] Afnan, Alizey is your wife,
[883.24] like I don’t have anyone in 
my life except you,
[889.64] very similarly, Alizey and Aunt Afsheen
don’t have anyone except you in their life.
[914.12] Madam Ramsha,
[916.40] please have this juice.
[919.48] I am not hungry, I don’t want 
to eat or drink anything.
[924.48] Please have something,
[925.76] you fainted because of not 
eating anything.
[935.04] You will feel weakness that way.
[949.20] Sir will get well by God’s will.
[959.52] Why are you hurting yourself 
by being concerned for him?
[969.68] Madam Ramsha, 
how are you feeling now?
[978.76] Let me know if you need something.
[982.48] I need Afnan.
[995.52] Brother Jamshed,
[997.20] you make me meet Afnan.
[1002.88] I know that you will definitely 
make me meet Afnan.
[1009.60] You just make me meet him once and 
it will be like a favor for life on me.
[1018.76] What are you saying madam?
[1028.52] We are your servants.
[1034.28] How can we do any favors to you?
[1038.64] I beg you,
[1040.12] I just want to meet Afnan for once, 
just make me meet him once.
[1043.28] Madam, please don’t do that.
[1054.12] Okay, I will find a solution.
[1065.76] Don’t do this, please.
[1078.96] Madam Ramsha, have this juice, please.
[1083.08] Have something, don’t hurt yourself 
out of concern for him.
[1087.32] I want to meet Afnan.
[1138.68] Yes Nazo, so tell me, 
is everything okay?
[1142.36] When are you coming back?
[1144.40] Okay we will meet when you come back.
[1147.20] Okay I will talk to you later. 
Okay, okay. Bye.
[1151.40] What happened, Alizey?
[1153.44] Mom, I am tired,
[1154.96] I am unable to take care 
of Afnan anymore.
[1158.44] Obviously, you are in such condition, 
in fact, you need care yourself.
[1171.16] I can understand.
[1176.60] I even asked Afnan that I will hire
a male nurse for him
[1180.48] but he refused.
[1190.44] He is saying I am absolutely fine now
[1198.36] though you know he is still unable 
to sleep at night because of pain.
[1213.92] I can’t see it, 
I have stay awake for him.
[1225.56] I have so much headache 
since morning today,
[1228.00] Thank God I don’t have to 
go to the office.
[1232.84] Don’t worry Alizey,
[1239.84] Afnan is way better now 
by the grace of God,
[1248.56] everything will be fine, my child.
[1253.20] Mom, I have no strength at all,
[1255.28] can you give breakfast to him please?
[1257.76] Yes, yes, why not?
[1259.28] In fact, you rest here 
I will see if Afnan needs
[1262.76] something I will give it to him, okay?
[1284.76] Afnan, all this can be done later too.
[1286.64] Don’t do any work for now at all.
[1289.20] Mr Ahmed at the office,
[1290.96] I spoke to him in the morning,
[1292.84] and he was saying whatever work 
will be there related to office,
[1295.76] he will keep on updating me,
[1297.08] I will let you know myself 
if there is anything important,
[1299.48] so please don’t worry 
and you just rest.
[1302.16] Yes, but there are some documents
[1304.48] that I need to tell him where they are, 
he doesn’t know where they are.
[1309.28] Afnan, I think you should just 
rest right now.
[1312.36] Leave all this, 
nothing will be ruined,
[1315.04] everything will be done on time, 
hmm?
[1318.64] Do you have a headache too?
[1325.16] So then please, rest.
[1328.32] Sleep for a while,
[1329.96] I have your phone with me, okay?
[1341.80] Rasheeda?
[1343.88] Rasheed, listen to me.
[1345.68] What happened? 
Is everything okay?
[1347.48] Yes everything is okay 
I have a work from you.
[1353.08] What work?
[1380.84] No No Rasheed, 
I cannot take this risk,
[1383.72] don’t you know Madam Alizey’s anger?
[1386.12] If she gets a slight clue,
[1387.88] there will be so much trouble
in the house.
[1390.48] I can’t do it.
[1391.68] nothing will happen, do you trust me?
[1395.04] Look keep me away from this matter.
[1398.12] okay, just rethink,
[1399.96] you have so many work from me
[1401.88] and I will also say the same at that time
to keep me away from your matters.
[1406.08] And don’t forget how worried were you,
[1408.92] your husband had no job,
[1411.16] I asked Boss and got him work 
at Brother Hussain’s workshop.
[1415.84] Look, don’t put so much stress 
on your brain,
[1419.48] go inside, I am bringing her.
[1423.20] Go.
[1452.12] Rasheeda,
[1454.48] take soup for Afnan in his room.
[1457.96] Sure.
[1473.28] Who is she?
[1482.04] Umm,
[1483.04] she is my Uncle’s daughter, 
she is a guest from the village.
[1486.80] So you brought her here?
[1494.80] Madam, the work has increased around 
the house since boss got unwell,
[1500.52] so, Abida is even on leave now.
[1515.80] I have just brought her for today,
[1517.68] she won’t bother you, 
just don’t worry
[1519.72] she won’t go anywhere
from the kitchen.
[1523.92] But why is she covering 
her face like this?
[1532.00] Actually my Uncle is very strict
[1534.64] and her fiancé is very punctual 
about covering too.
[1538.44] So, why is she hiding her face 
like this here,
[1540.52] as if there are so many men here,
tell her to remove this.
[1551.72] Listen?
[1553.16] Madam,
[1555.12] I have given the car at the workshop, 
we will get it back in the evening.
[1558.88] Okay.
[1561.28] Rasheeda, do one thing, send 
two cups of tea to Mom’s room.
[1565.32] Okay.
[1572.48] Thank God, we are saved.
[1575.68] Madam Ramsha, take soup 
in Sir Afnan’s room,
[1578.96] I will make tea for Madam Alizey.
[1582.08] Go.
[1687.52] Who are you?
[1708.08] Ramsha?
[1720.20] Ramsha, how are you here? 
Afnan,
[1722.64] Afnan how are you? 
Are you well?
[1725.08] Where did you get hurt?
[1726.56] Afnan, how, how did this all happen?
Afnan you…
[1728.76] I am absolutely fine, 
I met an accident Ramsha,
[1735.64] I am sorry I didn’t have 
my phone on me
[1738.04] So I couldn’t tell you but how come 
you are here and all this?
[1799.00] I feel sad about myself,
[1802.84] you went through so much difficulty 
and came here to meet me and I,
[1809.28] I couldn’t even inform you 
about this,
[1813.36] I know you love me a lot 
but I am absolutely fine,
[1817.00] I am absolutely fine, nothing 
has happened to me,
[1818.84] it’s just a matter of few days,
[1820.20] everything will be back to normal 
like before, you just go from here.
[1824.28] No, no, no, I won’t go anywhere 
from here, Afnan,
[1827.12] I can’t leave you and go anywhere,
[1828.96] I will stay close to you and 
take care of you
[1831.24] and all this has happened 
because of me anyway, Afnan.
[1834.16] How has this all happned 
because of you?
[1836.08] I gave you somuch tension and 
because of me you met an accident.
[1841.92] I want to live near you.
[1843.80] Ramsha, don’t hold yourself 
responsible,
[1846.44] nothing has happened to me, 
I am absolutely fine.
[1849.68] Everything will be like before
in a few days.
[1856.56] You are the one who says,
[1858.16] there is always God’s expedience 
in everything.
[1860.44] So then there must be expedience
of God that I am here.
[1864.00] Don’t push me away from you, Afnan,
[1866.04] let me stay near you, 
please Afnan.
[1868.44] Okay why are you crying. 
Afnan, careful.
[1870.84] it’s nothing, nothing, nothing.
[1872.56] Afnan, careful, what are you doing? 
Why are you crying?
[1875.60] I am saying everything is fine,
[1877.52] I am absolutely fine, 
this is a minor injury,
[1880.52] doctor has just made me wear this 
for no reason.
[1882.28] You must go, it won’t be good 
if someone sees you here right now.
[1886.60] I won’t go anywhere from here,
[1888.80] I will stay with you and 
take care of you,
[1891.48] and by the way I am your wife,
[1894.20] I have right on you,
[1896.24] you can’t take away my right from me,
 Afnan,
[1898.48] don’t ask me to go away from you, 
I won’t go anywhere.
[1900.72] Okay, I am not taking 
any right away from you.
[1905.36] I promised you,
[1908.52] I will get you your honor and
I will do that anyhow.
[1918.68] I won’t break my promise.
[1930.88] Just stay strong for a few days,
[1934.36] everything will be fine, 
stop crying,
[1936.68] you know I cannot tolerate you crying.
[1942.80] You made the soup yourself?
[1944.52] Yes.
[1945.76] it must be very bad.
[1948.52] Afnan. Try it.
[1950.24] Shall I feed you?
[1969.24] Not bad.
[1979.96] All your prayers get answered right?
[1982.88] So I was thinking if you can 
pray for me too?
[1988.56] Whenever I pray 
I always pray for you.
[1994.48] Yes but
[1997.16] there is one prayer that 
I especially want you to make.
[2001.24] What?
[2005.24] That May God take away 
all my difficulties.
[2016.56] Always keep our companionship intact
[2025.92] and remove all the problems.
[2053.20] Stay here today.
[2055.24] Ramsha I cannot stay today.
[2059.04] Alizey’s condition is not well.
[2064.32] I cannot leave her alone 
in this condition.
[2070.68] If things were normal I would have 
stayed but…
[2075.12] But what?
[2079.36] But I want Alizey to stay happy till 
our child comes in this world.
[2087.56] No problem Afnan,
[2090.16] I guess it was in our fate 
to meet like this.
