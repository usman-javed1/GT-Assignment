[26.60] I knew you would come,
[28.96] I knew you would definitely 
forgive me,
[31.84] you will realize that it was not 
my mistake. Afnan,
[35.24] thank you so much for coming.
[37.68] I am actually innocent, 
it’s not my fault.
[39.96] Thank you for understanding this.
[43.00] Now what is your plan next?
[49.64] What plan?
[50.76] There is no need to act innocent 
in front of me,
[53.72] what are you about to do next, 
tell me?
[56.92] What plan will I have, I…
[58.48] Ramsha, for God’s sake don’t 
do this drama in front of me,
[61.80] both of you women have 
made me go crazy,
[64.60] but I won’t get crazier now.
[67.08] Where is your phone?
[69.24] Quickly tell me 
where is your phone?
[70.72] There, it’s there.
[82.64] Afnan?
Enter the password,
[84.96] enter the password quickly.
[104.68] Why have you kept these 
Wedding pictures with you?
[107.72] Because it is our pictures…
[109.16] So?
[114.52] What do you want?
[116.80] You want to use them against me
 as well?
[119.48] You have kept them 
so you can blackmail me,
[122.52] like you got our shopping video viral,
[125.08] you will do the same with 
Wedding pictures too, right?
[127.40] Why would I do that?
[128.72] Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife.
[134.08] You got our video viral so people 
can get to know about us,
[138.56] and now you will get 
these Wedding pictures viral
[140.92] so everyone can know we are married,
[145.12] but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once,
[149.16] what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha?
[157.24] Delete all these.
[159.44] Delete them.
[168.52] In fact, leave it,
[171.28] I have always gotten ditched 
by trusting you.
[175.80] Why are you doing this, Afnan?
[178.12] I don’t trust you anymore, Ramsha,
[187.68] not at all,
[189.52] and where there is no trust,
[191.56] there is nothing at all.
[341.00] only now I have understood 
you well, Ramsha.
[344.52] Only now I have understood 
who you are.
[348.04] I married you, made you the honor 
of my house.
[353.92] I fulfilled the promise I made to my dad 
who was dying and what did you do?
[361.36] You defamed me in the whole society,
[363.92] nothing else.
[369.28] Tell me where did my love fall short
[375.00] that you cheated on me?
[376.92] Afnan, I didn’t cheat you,
[380.72] If I hadn’t promised my Dad,
[383.76] I would have taken you and thrown you 
out of my life right here, right now.
[387.60] Afnan.
[470.56] Afnan,
[472.08] pick up my call,
[474.76] why so upset?
[494.64] You haven’t just made me lose
trust in the world
[497.12] but my own self as well, Ramsha.
[500.92] Afnan, just come home once,
[510.48] come home, sit and listen to me,
[512.48] give me a chance to speak at least.
[514.48] Please don’t disturb me.
[520.60] I am already going through 
tough times because of you.
[525.60] For God’s sake give me peace 
for a while.
[529.80] I don’t want to talk to you, 
I don’t want to meet you.
[542.16] Not because of any love or affair,
[544.64] I came to you because 
I felt pity for you.
[547.44] I felt pity on you and came to help
[550.52] so you can go back home with
 whatever honor is left
[554.72] but I had no idea you would barge 
in my life as a trouble instead.
[560.76] And yes, one last thing,
[563.48] you should still thank God 
that it was me,
[567.00] and I have been raised very well,
[570.44] had it been any other guy 
instead of me,
[573.68] they would have already 
compromised your honor.
[591.40] You have caused me a lot of pain, Afnan,
[595.88] I have been through so much trouble.
[605.20] Look I know you had to tolerate 
a lot because of me
[619.24] but I promise you now
[622.56] that there will be no tears in 
your eyes from now on.
[627.00] You have married me because 
you found out I was innocent
[632.60] so that you can give me support.
[843.92] Sir, these are few cheques, sign them.
[847.44] Please take them back,
[849.20] I am not doing any work today, 
bring them to me tomorrow.
[865.80] Ramsha,
[868.24] pack your bags, I am coming 
to pick you up.
[871.88] Don’t ask me any questions,
[874.44] do as I say.
[882.12] you are not the first man 
in Ramsha’s life,
[885.12] I don’t know how many men before you…
[886.68] Enough Aunt,
[890.16] Ramsha is not that type of girl,
[892.92] she has changed herself.
[897.40] She hasn’t changed,
[901.80] she just put on this character,
[909.28] and she got successful in it.
[915.96] And my daughter,
[920.92] wrong happened to my daughter, Afnan.
[928.68] Ramsha was my past and 
you are my present.
[936.56] She is your past but why do I still 
see her in your present, Afnan?
[947.44] In your life, in your thinking, 
in your talks,
[951.12] in fact, even in this house 
I just see her.
[961.48] Where am I?
[963.84] No Alizeh, look, listen to me carefully 
and try to understand it.
[967.92] I have heard and understood 
everything,
[976.92] now I don’t trust in anything you say.
[996.36] Sincerity, love, relationship,
none of these matters according to you?
[1002.00] It’s not that Afnan. 
Then what is it Afnan?
[1004.84] You did the same to me,
[1008.08] you even considered my status, 
you weighed my love, my sincerity,
[1012.40] all of it by my status.
[1014.80] That was the biggest mistake
 of my life
[1018.32] that I still regret.
[1020.32] For God’s sake, Afnan,
[1023.40] stop making these mistakes,
[1027.24] because you make mistakes and 
then I have to suffer.
[1103.04] Afnan?
[1105.64] Don’t be scared,
[1115.44] whatever has already happened, 
nothing more than that can happen now.
[1125.88] The only sad part is that
[1129.28] our marriage is not taking place
because of our love
[1142.56] but because of that stain,
[1146.64] you put on my character,
[1160.52] I have to fulfill this relationship 
because of that today.
[1164.88] Afnan, why don’t you understand 
that whatever has happened is not my fault?
[1168.28] Whatever happened shouldn’t 
have happened
[1175.96] but from now you are my honor,
[1186.68] and try to not compromise my respect 
at least this time.
[1231.80] You go inside, I will take this call 
and come.
[1307.80] You cannot come back to our home,
[1315.76] and anyway you are divorced
[1317.48] and even after that he is taking such
good care of you, he married you,
[1324.56] it is your responsibility too 
to make your home.
[1329.44] Look my relationship with Afnan
 is about to strengthen now,
[1337.60] there is no place for any third person,
[1341.16] do you understand what I am saying?
[1371.32] You?
[1384.08] How dare you even step 
into this house?
[1391.08] I have brought her here.
[1407.32] She will not live in this house, 
she will get out of here, get out of here!
[1409.80] Alizeh, Alizeh, what is wrong with you?
 Control yourself.
[1416.52] please I don’t want more chaos
 in this house.
[1419.52] Whatever you want to say,
say it to me,
[1424.28] I have brought Ramsha here.
[1426.84] I don’t want to talk about anything,
[1433.48] if she will live in this house, 
I won’t live here.
[1439.44] I am leaving.
[1458.44] You don’t have to worry,
[1465.04] you go to your room.
[1491.88] I am just watching how big of 
a headache has
[1496.04] this second marriage and 
second wife become for you.
[1501.96] Look, has someone said something 
to you, Alizeh?
[1505.96] Whatever you are saying, 
I am unable to understand.
[1509.12] Tell me.
[1514.36] I forgot, I forgot,
[1517.04] I forgot you don’t want peace
in my life at all
[1523.84] and if accidentally I am about 
to get some peace in my life,
[1526.36] you do something that 
takes the peace away.
[1531.24] Afnan,
[1534.88] divorce Ramsha.
[1554.20] Alizeh?
[1555.56] Alizeh? Please, 
what are you doing, dude?
[1557.72] I am already very worried, Alizeh, 
for God’s sake don’t do this else I will get mad.
[1562.28] you have made me mad, Afnan.
[1571.12] You brought that girl here first,
[1573.24] had an affair with her, married her
[1582.44] and now you want to keep her
 here again on my head.
[1592.80] What do you think Afnan,
[1594.36] I will quietly watch the show here?
[1596.52] Not at all!
[1603.40] I am not a disgusting illiterate girl
 like Ramsha,
[1616.48] I know my rights.
[1624.28] I am not dependent on you… you..
[1626.24] Alizeh, please, please 
you can’t do this, Alizeh.
[1632.76] I cannot let you go like this Alizeh,
[1640.56] especially not in this condition at all, 
you are my responsibility.
[1649.52] Just think
[1651.16] how will you even go out 
in this condition?
[1657.40] If not about me or yourself, 
at least think about our baby,
[1660.24] how will he get affected.
[1661.52] Did you think about our baby when 
you were doing a second marriage?
[1669.24] So then why should I think?
[1677.84] You can be a father and 
still be this selfish
[1679.76] then why can’t I be selfish 
being a mother, Afnan?
[1683.52] Okay so that means 
you won’t listen to me?
[1693.96] So, then I am helpless, 
I will have to go talk to Aunt
[1696.04] and involve her in all this, 
you will get controlled by her.
[1698.64] Af…
[1699.36] Aunt? 
Afnan, stop.
[1706.48] Aunt, I have no other way except 
bringing Ramsha into this house.
[1715.20] I know
[1717.80] I got married by my choice,
[1730.28] this is very wrong with Alizeh
[1741.84] but Aunt,
[1745.32] I am the only person who has been
the most affected by all this.
[1763.44] If Alizeh can forgive me,
[1768.16] there should be no other reason 
except my health.
[1785.88] My health is deteriorating 
day by day,
[1798.36] I am unable to focus on business,
[1807.48] the whole business is suffering loss.
[1819.72] I don’t understand what should I do.
[1835.48] Sometimes I think,
 if dad was alive today,
[1842.00] I wouldn’t have been in 
so much trouble,
[1854.88] he might have done something 
to bring peace in my life.
[1871.48] But I beg you, Aunt,
[1881.04] you are the elder in this house,
[1885.64] make Alizeh understand
[1895.88] else we can suffer damage 
that will never be repaired.
[1909.76] It will be better for all of us.
