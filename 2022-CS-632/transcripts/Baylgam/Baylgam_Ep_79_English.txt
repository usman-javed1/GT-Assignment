For Go’s sake open the door, Uncle must be worried for me, I still haven’t reached home, 
he must be worried. Why have you locked me here? is there anyone here or not? Someone, please come here. I want to go home. Why have you locked me here? Is there anyone here to tell me? 
Is there no one to help me here? Oh God, help me, Oh God, help me. Mr. Qasim, I really apologize a lot for 
what my constable did. It is not your constable’s fault. I am an aged ordinary man, and who asks a common man
 these days? I am really sorry, Mr. Qasim, I have noted your complaint. We will try our best to find your daughter. It is very late now, you must go home and rest. The fear won’t let me sleep, Mr. DSP. I took responsibility of that girl, I promised the Almighty God that 
I would take care of her. What will I answer God 
if something happens? Okay, I am aged and old, no one listens to me but God will definitely listen to me. He listens to everyone’s requests. Umm, okay let me drop you to the car. No, no, if you can do something, just help that girl, find her, don’t worry about me, I have spent my life and I will somehow totter and 
manage to reach, it’s just that girl is my responsibility, 
Mr. DSP, you find her. That girl also wants to see 
the colors of life, my time is near. God will listen to my request, He loves us more than 70 mothers, He will listen to me, 
He listens to everyone. Greetings, may peace be upon you. 
Greetings, is everything okay brother, 
where were you? Did you find anything about Ramsha? I didn’t find anything about Ramsha but I spoke to Mr. DSP, 
and he has ensured he will find Ramsha soon 
by the grace of God, I even searched for her at the hospitals, but didn’t find anything about her
 anywhere. Yes, that what is I was thinking that, 
why did you get late. Actually, I called you so many times, you even left your phone at home. You were even getting a lot of calls here. Brother, if you will worry so much about Ramsha, you will get sick like this. Look, God forbid, if Ramsha had met
 any accident, some accident, so we would have at least gotten 
a call from the hospital or if she was kidnapped, someone would have definitely 
called for ransom. Now, brother whatever the situation 
is right now, it evidently shows that she has left by her choice. What do you keep on saying, 
Afsheen? Why would she leave without telling? May God keep things well, just pray to God that things are well. When I started to walk on this path and start learning about religion, 
I felt a very solid change, I felt nice. When you walk on the path of religion
and study religion, your faith in God increases. Faith in God. The one who has faith in God, all the fears go away from their life. You know we ask God to give us 
a chance to offer prayers, we ask God to show us 
the right path, right? And any person, any person of God, when they repent with a true heart so all these mistakes and sins 
are washed away you know how? Like we wash clothes, 
properly drain them, or like we wash the dishes with a 
sponge or a detergent or a powder, similarly, these tears that are 
shining in your eyes, they wash away the stains like this, if God sees two drops of tears
 in anyone’s eyes and if they offer prayers of forgiveness, 
God forgives them. Will anyone tell me 
where is the Qiblah? I need to make ablution, 
I need to offer prayers. Can anyone hear me? OH God, what trouble 
have I gotten into? Oh God, please accept my prayers, I don’t know where I am and 
who has kidnapped me, I don’t know what is my fault 
but you help me, Oh God, help me out of this trouble, bring ease for me in this difficulty,
Uncle must be worried, get me home, my Lord, make my way easy, save me from these bad people, give me patience, 
make my way easy. Where did this Afnan go? Afnan? Afnan? 
Hmm? Why are you sleeping here? Is Ramsha back? No. Afnan, if she had to stay here, 
why would she leave at first place? But why are you sleeping here 
because of her? Come on, get up and come 
inside the bedroom, I have been waiting for you 
for so long. Okay. Brother, your blood pressure is very high, why are you hurting yourself 
for Ramsha? You will get unwell like this. You didn’t sleep all night, please 
brother have mercy on yourself. It is not anyone’s fault that 
Ramsha has gone now. What do you mean by she is gone, 
where did she go? What a weird thing to say. Brother, we are all trying but all this won’t bring her back. Please take care of yourself. You didn’t sleep all night. 
Please try to sleep. Afnan didn’t come, Alizeh? Mom, you said that Ramsha will also 
get out of Afnan and Uncle’s heart once she leaves the house but both of them father and son 
are mourning because she left. You don’t take tension, 
things will go as I said. How should I not take tension? I guess you don’t know how 
Afnan is behaving right now. He is reacting as if his wife has left
 this house instead of Ramsha. I cannot tolerate all this. Alizeh, you are one hell of 
an emotional girl and you don’t have patience at all, everything will happen 
but with time, everything cannot happen immediately. Actually, all this is very easy 
for you to say, because you haven’t seen Afnan yet,
that is why. Mom, by the way, will you agree to one thing that I say? Sure, tell me. Mom, you call them and 
ask them to kill Ramsha. Ssshhh! Are you mad? I am being honest, I will only get peace in my life 
when she is dead else, I will always be worried like this,
you get her killed. Speak slowly, we will be in so much trouble 
if someone hears you. Nothing will happen to Ramsha but 
you will definitely get us both killed. Fool! How can Ramsha go anywhere 
without informing? She is a responsible girl,
she is not careless. This is not possible, she is definitely in some trouble,
 or difficulty and my heart is sinking 
thinking about it. Hey brother, please control yourself. Alizeh has just called all her 
academy friends but there is no clue about 
Ramsha anywhere. Don’t worry, Afnan will come some 
news with him by the grace of God. What did you say that Afnan will come
with some information? Why don’t you say that he will bring 
Ramsha along, by God’s will? Afsheen? Do you know something? 
Tell me? Ramsha, you didn’t do good with me, you shouldn’t have done that to me. Why did you do this to me? Why Ramsha, why? I will never forgive you, never ever, never. She ran away with her lover. You shut up. By the way I am surprised and 
a bit sad for you as well, about the fact that I thought
you are her only lover, but there are more here. Shut up! I’ll pull your tongue if you say one bad
 word about Ramsha’s character. And you think I am wearing 
bangles here? I won’t do anything in return? 
Hey? For God’s sake, quiet, 
go away from here, Shani, go. Ask him to leave from here. Shut up, I am asking you to leave, go away from here. Yes, I am talking about Ramsha, what were you talking to her about? Who are you to ask me that? She is a friend, it is up to me whatever I say to her. What? She is your friend? 
She is your friend? She is more than a friend. Why should I tell you? Mind your own business. 
Do you understand? Did someone come to meet you 
at the academy today? No, why? Yes, because I was thinking that your 
relatives don’t come to meet you at home, so there is a possibility that any of your 
relatives came to meet you at the academy. No one came to meet me Afnan. And I don’t have any relatives 
in this world now anyway, so someone’s presence and absence 
don’t make any difference to me. Mr. Qasim’s blood pressure and
heartbeat is very high, it’s better if you get him 
out of this stress, else if the condition remains the same, we will have to shift him 
to the hospital. No doctor, that is not possible. I tried to convince Dad but 
he is not agreeing to go to the hospital, please add something to his medication that makes his condition better at home. It’s not so easy, we cannot give high doses 
to Mr. Qasim at his age, and look medicine only works when the patient himself 
wants to get well. So then doctor, 
how will brother get well? Because he is not sleeping, eating, or taking medicines either, 
I am so tensed. Look, I haven’t seen the will to live 
in Qasim’s eyes. He has become quiet. I did his check-up. He is quiet and this silence is not good 
for his health. I think, it is serious advice to you all, that keeps him away from stress, 
talk about good things with him, happy things. Anyway, I will come in the evening 
and check him again, okay? Okay, doctor. 
Thank you. Come, doctor, let me see you off. Okay bye. That is why I was against 
since the very first day that this girl should stay in our home. Uncle wouldn’t have been 
attached to her and he wouldn’t be in this condition 
today either. Obviously Alizeh, Ramsha has just used brother 
for her purpose, and look she showed her true colors. But let me tell you something, I have never seen a selfish girl 
like Ramsha. Ramsha, you? Alizeh, 
Alizeh. Ramsha. What are you doing here? Where are you coming from? What happened? That guy left you 
who you ran with? Obviously, now just because that guy left you,
you have no other house to go to, so you came back here. Why? Didn’t you think of brother’s honor 
at all? Yeah? Or the guy’s family refused 
to accept you, obviously who will accept such girls? Which guy? Who are you talking about? I didn’t run away with any boy, I got kidnapped, don’t you guys
 know that? Some people kidnapped me, Alizeh, Alizeh knows it, all of this happened 
in front of Alizeh. Tell Alizeh, you didn’t tell all of them that they kidnapped me 
in front of you. What is she saying? 
What stories are you telling? Alizeh, we were both in the car, come people stopped their car 
in front of our car, they dragged me and kidnapped me, and in front of you, you were even 
stopping them, you didn’t tell anyone anything, 
why aren’t you telling them? Please, don’t lie. I am being very honest, something has happened to you, 
I don’t know why are you lying.
