How is your office going, Afnan? It is going fine. Why do I feel you are in a bad mood? It feels like your wife fought with you. No, nothing like that. You thank God you have one wife, if you had another wife, God knows what would have 
happened to you. What happened? Nothing. I think a cat was crossing the path, I think it passed, so I was saving it. Okay. We have also reached your office. Yes, park over there. You look a little tensed. Is all okay? Yes, everything is okay. Are you hiding something from me? Why would I hide something from you? Why are you asking me this question? Okay, you came home late last night, 
where did you go? I went to a friend, 
you don’t know him. I am surprised, earlier all our friends were mutual but now I don’t know who my friend is and you don’t know who my friend is. Whenever I ask you, you always say you were with a friend. Also introduce me to 
this friend of yours. He should know I am your wife. Are you doubting me? Should I tell you the truth? No. I am not doubting you at all. Yes, I used to doubt you earlier, when Ramsha used to live 
in our home. But since Ramsha has left, I am at peace. Okay, I will see you then. Hmm. Bye. What? Alizay saw you? Ramsha… if you had seen Alizay earlier, 
then why did you go to her? What was the need for you to go, 
Ramsha? I didn’t see her Afnan. How was I to know 
I will see her suddenly and she saw me and she stopped me. A friend of her lives here. But I am worried that Alizay shouldn’t have seen you 
at this time and in this condition. Stay here tonight. Ramsha, I wont be able
 to stay today. Alizay’s condition is not good. I cannot leave her alone 
in this condition. If the condition was normal, I would have stayed, but…
But what? But I want that Alizay stay happy till the time 
our child doesn’t come to this world. No problem, Afnan. Maybe meeting like this was written
in our fate. I am sorry. I know you are really hurt 
with what I said, your heart is hurt. But I am sorry. That is why
 I came to apologize. What happened? Why are you looking at me like that? I am seeing that you show so much love 
for me in a moment, and what happens to you 
in the next moment, I am unable to understand, Afnan. Even I don’t understand. But maybe this is the way I love. Forgive me, please. How did you like them? Really good. Yes, but they are not 
as beautiful as you. Stop it. Don’t lie so much. I am not lying, 
I am speaking the truth. You know I love you a lot. You look really good. You know, I went to the office, 
but I couldn’t focus. I thought I would come to convince you. I saw these flowers on the way 
so I thought of you. So I bought them. Thank you, Afnan. Now that you have agreed,
can I do something I want? Yes. I have not eaten anything 
since last night. I didn’t even have breakfast, 
I am really hungry. You didn’t have breakfast? You sit, I will make breakfast 
in two minutes and bring it. What is the need to make breakfast, 
let’s go somewhere and have breakfast or we will order something good. Not at all, I will make breakfast 
for you myself. I forgot you wont agree. Okay, let’s do one thing, I will make 
breakfast for you today, I know how to make good cheese omelet.
Where are the eggs? Afnan, why are you cutting the fruit? I will ask in the kitchen, 
they will cut it. Hey, I know the people in the kitchen 
can cut it, but you don’t eat it when they cut it. 
Here you go, eat. Afnan, I had tea a little while back. I am in no mood to have fruit right now. Hey, Alizay, listen to something I say. You always become stubborn. You already didn’t listen to me 
about the office, now you are even going to the office. Look, if this is what you want to 
talk to me about, I will leave. Okay, wait. Wait. I wont talk about this. Happy? Come on, eat these fruits. I am eating. You know, the doctor has strictly said that you have to increase the intake of fruits 
and milk, you have a lot of weakness. Any other order? Hey, how can I order you, madam? I can only request you but 
you don’t even agree to that. Now I cannot agree to 
everything you say. Look, when am I telling you 
to quit your job? I am just saying you take leaves 
for some time from the office. Afnan, neither can I quit my job 
right now, nor can I take leaves. You know right now my job 
is really important. And your health? It is important too, you have 
to take care of that. What happened to me? Why are you and mama 
always after me? Hey man, whatever we are saying is in your care. Come on, Afnan. I am not a child. I can take care of myself. Okay, tell me something, you complained to mama 
about me, right? No. why would I complain about you? I know everything. You have complained to mama 
about me, that is why she is after me that 
I quit the office. You tell me, what else could I do? You clearly said no to me. Yes, but I knew it wont be easy 
for you to say no to aunt. So you took advantage of this. So I did it all for your betterment. It is good, just rest. Afnan, I don’t understand you. I too feel the same way about you 
in this regard. How are you feeling now? Mama, it is the same nowadays, 
nothing special. How are you feeling? I am fine. Okay listen, I had to go. You do one thing, 
please sleep on time. Where are you going? I have a meeting, I am going 
to attend it and come back. Afnan, schedule your work a little. Now you should be with her 
at this time. You are absolutely right, aunt. But this meeting came in such 
an urgency, that I have to go. A deal has to be locked.
Once it is locked, there will be no issue. Okay fine, come back soon. When do you worry for me, Afnan? Hey, why are you saying this? I will just go and come back in a flash. You just sleep on time. In fact, aunt it is your responsibility. Alizay should go in her room on time. Fine. Okay take care of yourself. 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Mama… Alizay, now things are settling down. He cares for you so much. He has gone for some work, 
he will come back. Don’t worry. What did you pray for? Why should I tell you? This is between me and my God. You don’t tell anyone this. Yes, you don’t tell anyone. But all your prayers are answered. So I was thinking that I ask you to put in a good word 
for me too. I pray for you. I always pray for you. Yes, but, there is a prayer that I especially
 want you to make. What? That may God ease all my difficulties. May we always be together. And all the worries that are there, may those end too. I will pray. Thank you. Shall we go now? 
Come on. Wait, I will go get my bag. Okay listen. 
Yes? You didn’t tell me how do I look? You look good. Really? I only look good. I understand. One minute. No, you look really pretty. Thank you. I will go get my bag. 
Two minutes. Yes, aunt. You come home immediately. What happened?
 All okay? No, nothing is fine. Alizay has created a scene at home. What does this mean? 
What is she doing? Afnan, I am trying to give her, 
her medication, but she is refusing to take it. She is getting so angry, you please come home 
and control things. Fine aunt, you don’t worry. 
I am coming. Okay. Come on, Afnan. Ramsha, we wont be able to go. Why? What happened, Afnan? Aunt called. I have to go home. Alizay has created a scene again. She is not taking her medication 
and the doctor has strictly said she needs to take her medication 
on time. I am sure she wouldn’t have eaten
 anything either, I will have to go and 
sort these matters. We will plan for some other day. 
We will go tomorrow. I am sorry, I will have to go. Please Ramsha. Please, understand me. Fine, Afnan. You are right. We will cancel the plan, 
no problem. Ramsha. Ramsha, please listen to me.
 Ramsha. Ramsha, please open the door. Ramsha, I know you are being mistreated,
but what can I do? I am helpless. Ramsha. Fine, don’t open the door. I am mad that I am making 
so much effort. I am leaving. goodbye. Alizay, please go and 
have your medicine. Mama, I don’t want to eat 
the medicine. Can I say something? Not just me, but even Afnan is getting 
tired of this stubbornness of yours. You should thank God that God gave you such 
a loving husband. Yes, I have such a loving husband that you called him two hours back. He didn’t even bother to come 
and ask me. Okay are you not my love, go and have your medicine. Alizay, now you have to take care 
of your future child along with yourself. Did you not hear 
what the doctor said? He said you really need 
to care for your health. Mama, you and Afnan, both of you only blackmail me 
emotionally. What have I done? Hello. What? What happened, Alizay? Mama, that… What is the matter? Speak up. Mama, Afnan. Afnan. What happened to Afnan? You are treating me well, I married you and kept you here. I have deprived you of all your rights, I even feel embarrassed looking you 
in the eyes. And how can I live with Alizay? I have no respect or place in her eyes and if I tell you the truth, she wants to live with me out of 
stubbornness and not out of her love. Who is there? Greetings brother Jamshed. You are here at this hour? All okay? Madam Ramsha, Afnan… Mr. Afnan had an accident. What? How? I just got a call from home, 
his car had an accident. Yes, but where is Afnan? 
What happened to him? Is he fine? I don’t know that. But I have heard they took him 
to the hospital.
