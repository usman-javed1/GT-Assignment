Send Mr Liaquat to me. Yes Sir? What is this? What is this? 
I cannot accept this thing at all. I asked you to lay off some staff
 from here and you have brought me the file 
for their increment. Take it back, I won’t sign this. Sir this is not workers’ demand, in fact, 
these are the orders from Mr Qasim, In the last meeting he ordered to 
give increments to workers. Dad is… okay leave the file, I will look into it. Right sir. I don’t know, I don’t know when will dad listen to me. This is with it? 
Hmm. uncle, help me a little, I am confused 
which jewelry set to choose. My child, I don’t know 
about these things, you must ask Afnan, in fact, 
decide it yourself. Just let it be, uncle, 
what shall I ask Afnan? He has no interest in all these. Whenever I ask him he tells me that everything 
looks good on you and buy all of them. So he is right, 
our daughter is so beautiful, whatever she will wear would look nice. Thank you so much, uncle. Mom, how does this set look? I like both of them, 
but this one looks prettier. This is prettier?
Yes it is. Then let’s finalize this one. Thank God, at least you liked something but if you want anything else 
you can let me know I will bring it. And it will be best if you accompany me 
to the jeweler yourself. Mom, you know how I am busy
 because of office? I wouldn’t have time. I have done these little bits of preparations 
with so much difficulty. Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. Peace be upon you and 
God's mercy and blessings. Is everything okay? How come 
you are here at this time? Dad, everything is fine, I just wanted to discuss 
something with you. You sent Mr Ahmed to me yes, did you sign the notice then? No dad, umm that is what I am saying, 
I wanted to discuss it with you. Dad, dad, we always listen to you, umm, now recently you have just announced 
bonuses for all the employees, everyone has medical insurance, all the other expenses are pretty much 
covered by the company as well. So then this increment 
in salaries all of a sudden? I didn’t quite understand it,
 dad and by the way, who does so much these days? Hmm. That’s a nice question, who does this? My son, our great Prophet Mohammad (PBUH)
 used to do it. His Follower Scholar Rizwan Ullahi 
Tala Majmaeen used to do it and we all should do it. He would create ease and 
facilities for his workers. And facilitating your employees, and creating ease for them is 
Sunnah of our Prophet (PBUH). Dad, dad, you are taking me wrong, I didn’t mean to say that at all, look dad, I am just trying to say 
that you are already doing a lot, employees do not get such relief
in any company but after this, employees are going to get spoiled and they will expect increment 
and bonuses every year. I know there has been inflation dad, but it’s not just employees 
who are suffering from inflation, the company has been suffering too and 
our budget has been going over-sized. Hey Afnan, just make intentions first, God will create ways for you. Now look we are having this small ceremony
 in our home, we are making so many arrangements for it,
 we are sending so much, we are not thinking about it, we are not having any thoughts 
about this expenditure then if we are facilitating and creating ease 
for our employees to pleasure God, then just consider it charity, 
He will bless us. But dad, I… 
I don’t want to argue, son, I just want you to think about it 
and feel what I am saying. I have gotten the permission 
after so much difficulty, dad spoke on my behalf only 
then did Mom allow me. What the hell? 
Give me my phone. What? I am telling you that I have gotten 
the permission with so much difficulty and you’re busy in your phone? Dude, Afnan is not taking 
my call since yesterday. I don’t know where he is busy, 
I have called him and messaged him too but he is not responding at all. To hell with Afnan. Tell me, shall I wear my black maxi? Brother! For God’s sake, don’t wear that old maxi again, you look so bad, 
you can’t even imagine. At least sometimes you can say 
good about someone. You just say everything on face. Because that is how I am, 
that’s why. Okay, Mom has asked me 
to come back soon, so ask Alizey what are the timings 
of the arrival of the groom, we will plan accordingly. She was saying that her in laws 
will come early, that is why we have to go early too 
and come back early as well. Thank God that mom has 
spoken to Alizey’s mom that is why we peacefully got 
the permission to go. Thank God that Alizey’s mom 
spoke to aunt, now aunt will talk to mom and 
mom won’t bother us. Now tell me what to wear. Let me do one thing, let me get you some good clothes
from my cupboard, wear them, don’t wear your own, please. Give me my phone. yes, No Mr Zahid, I am emailing it 
to you right now. Okay, okay. Oh God! Tell your office people to spare you 
at least today. Mom, I just have to sent 
an urgent email, just wait for 2 minutes. Alizey, put your phone down, please. Mom, just… Alizey, let’s go to the bridal room, you have 
to freshen up your makeup as well. Mom, I am almost done, 
just wait a minute. It is an important work, let me.. I am asking you to keep your phone down,
 we are getting late. Let’s go. Shut off this problem and let’s go. Mr Liaquat, just make sure that there is
no mismanagement here at all. Don’t worry, sir, 
everything will be managed. Great, umm, there shouldn’t be 
any complaint. Okay. And properly receive all the guests 
and bring them straight to the hall. Right sir. Please make sure all the guests 
get their proper protocol. Don’t worry at all sir, 
it will be done exactly that way, Thank you. You look so handsome by the grace of God, 
Afnan. You don’t look any less beautiful. 
You are looking really nice. Thank you. It’s good you got ready in time, 
brother is calling you. Okay, tell him there are a 
few chores here and there, I am going to finish them and come. 
Okay. Aunt? Has Alizey gotten ready? Hmmm, you are so concerned about Alizey? No, it’s not that, I will always be concerned for her but I know she takes proper time 
in getting ready, I want today’s event to start in time and guests doesn’t have to wait. And you know dad pretty well, he is very punctual and disciplined, 
he will get upset. Just don’t worry at all, she is absolutely ready and
looks really beautiful. She is sitting in the bridal room. You go meet brother, okay?
Okay. Umm, Afnan sir, please come and check 
the food arrangement. Come, let’s go. Salma, that Shiza from the morning show, did you see her program today? Oh God! She was wearing 
such beautiful clothes. Shiza? 
Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. How are you son? Where is Annie? Why is there so much silence at home? Umm, both of them has gone to a 
friend’s house for her wedding. In a friend’s wedding? 
Whose wedding? Her friend Aliza, 
they have gone to her wedding. And they have gone alone? Hey, no, no, son, your uncle went to drop them and they will come back with their friends, their friends live here only, they are from
the same neighborhood, they will come with them. You guys have let them go alone, I mean, someone should have 
gone with them Hey, your aunt is telling that 
your uncle has dropped them, why are you worried? Uncle has dropped them, he hasn’t gone to the function with them, both of them are alone in the function. Shani, there 2 3 friends have 
gone along too, they all will be together, why are you 
getting so worried? Mom, I have told you a lot of time 
before as well that I don’t like that you allow Annie to go like this. okay my child, I will be careful next time,
don’t worry, I won’t let Annie go anywhere alone. No, let me go check on them, 
I am not hungry. By the way, sister in law, 
Shani is right, one of us should have gone 
with the girls. You are absolutely right Salma, but you know then I thought that 
we don’t know anyone there, what will we do at the wedding there and yes, I have spoken to Alizey’s mom, she was saying that the function 
will end very early, girls will come back home early. Thank you, sister in law that 
you took brother Sajid’s name, if you would have said that 
girls are going alone, he would have been so upset, 
he would have gotten really mad. Salma, I am not that fool. I just hope they come soon. That’s it, that’s it. Come, Annie, hurry up. Quickly give me Rs500. Why 500, sister? It will be Rs700. Why brother? We decided Rs500 and I said I will get dropped
in front of the banquet, I can’t get off on the road. Sister, you said you wanted to get dropped 
on the roundabout, and then you have brought me inside here. I will charge at least Rs200 more. What is wrong with you? Okay I understand that it is supposed to be 
Rs200 from the Defence turning till here but that doesn’t mean that 
your Rs200 petrol has been used. Have some shame, you are lying. Sister, there is petrol then oil, it also takes mantainance.
What will I take home? Sister at least give Rs100 more. That’s it, give him Rs50 more, if you want them keep it else, 
we are leaving. Sister, I am a poor man. 
Hey enough now. Just take these Rs600 and go. Ramsha, will waste all the time here? 
Won’t you go inside? He has already brought us here 
at the slowest speed. Let’s go inside. Excuse me? 
Yes? This is Alizey’s function, right? 
Yes, ma’am. Thank you. Wow Ramsha, Alizey’s family has done such 
an amazing set up. Look at the banquet. By the way, Alizey’s family doesn’t have that 
much money as they have spent on this wedding. You are such a fool. How will Alizey’s family do all this? Her in laws are very rich people, they have done all this and you know they man Alizey is getting 
married to has come from Dubai. Now this all was to be done by them. True that. By the way listen, there are no guests yet, and look the hall is so amazing, the stage is so pretty,
 let’s make videos, come. Are you mad? It will look 
very strange Ramsha. Annie, you have a lot of problems 
with everything. Come let’s go there. 
I will go sit on stage, make a nice video of me. Come on, now hurry up. I will sit here, you just stand here 
and make my video. Hold this, hold this.
Okay. Quickly. Shall I come up, or from here?
No, no, that’s it. we will start at 3 2 1. Okay. 
ready? Yes. 
Is everything fine? Yes. 
Come on. Ready. 1 2 3. Move a bit there, 
move a bit there. What are you girls doing? Come down. Excuse me? What do you mean 
by what are we doing? We are making a video. Is there any restriction of 
using phone here? You tell me who are you and 
what are you doing here? Oh hello! Talk nicely. What do you think are we lying? It’s not that, it is Alizey’s wedding and 
Alizey is our best friend, understand? You are Alizey’s friend? Why are all of them looking at us like this? I told you not to make any video here. You don’t even listen to anyone. 
Shut up. Why shouldn’t I make a video? This is not some classroom 
where a sir will come and ask what is going on and 
we will be scared. It is a wedding hall and we will take pictures
and videos here. Greetings madam. 
Yes Mr Liaquat? What is it? Don’t worry, 
they will talk to Alizey and everything will get fine then, 
he is just being over for no reason. Ma’am, some of your friends are here, 
they want to talk to you. Here, talk to them. Hello? Yes Alizey? Who are these people in your wedding? They are asking strange questions. They are saying why are you 
making videos and pictures here, they think we are lying. Tell him 
we are your best friends. Tell him, tell him. Yes, tell me, who is it? what is your name? Alizey? This doesn’t sound like Alizey’s voice. Brother where were you 
I was calling you for so long, your phone was switched off. I went for prayers, you know 
I switch off my phone. I asked Afnan to distribute the food 
of this event in Darul Uloom and to Orphans and needy kids, 
where is Afnan? Yes brother, Afnan told me, let the event get over I will send 
the leftover food then. Oh God! Forgive me. This is our problem, we give the leftover food 
in the way of God. What is wrong? There is unlimited food arranged, 
it won’t get short. Send it to the needy first 
because of whom God blesses us. Hey, we have food late, but some people have food in time.
 Okay? Send it to them Ask Wasim to send it to the needy. 
In fact, you leave it, I will ask him. What do you do Afsheen? Umm excuse me, if you girls don’t mind, can I borrow my fiancé from 
you guys for a bit? Thank you, thank you so much. Hmm, what happened? Alizey, I wanted to, I wanted to talk about something 
important with you. What happened? 
Is everything okay? No it’s not okay. But promise me that 
you will understand me. Tell me what happened? Alizey, actually the things is that? What? you look very pretty today Alizey. You send these girls from here 
to say this? yes, so what? Like they say that if you want to say something like that, you should immediately say it. When I looked at you, you looked so pretty so I couldn’t resist, that is why I told everyone that I am going to borrow you for a bit, my Alizey. I am very lucky, very much. Afnan, someone will see. Hey, let them see then, what are we doing? We are talking to our fiancé,
showing love. By the way, if dad sees me, 
he will pull my ears. So sorry Sir, actually our friend Alizey, even she is getting married 
in the same hall, I didn’t know that there is an engagement 
ceremony going on in this area, I am so sorry, 
we had a misunderstanding. It’s okay, I guess you guys had to go to 
the portion next to this one, you guys came here mistakenly, I will ask guard to escort you there. No, sir the guard is not needed, 
we will go on our own, you hold these flowers, 
I will go on my own. Let’s go. I was telling you that Alizey’s family
 cannot do such a nice set up but you don’t listen to me. What is my fault? 
You were also walking so slowly, why are you telling me now? Don’t argue 
else the food will get over there. oh God! You still care about the food? 
That is so embarrassing. Let’s go, let’s go. Are you okay? 
Do you need something? I am absolutely fine, 
the dress is just very heavy. You look very beautiful. Thank you mom. I thought I should ask you 
if you need anything to eat, any juice or something. 
No, no, nothing. Where is Afnan? Afsheen? I will be back in a second. 
Yes. Yes, brother? What are we waiting for? Let’s do the engagement ceremony. Okay. Afnan, come let’s do the ceremony. Let’s go. 
Why is Afnan needed? Let’s do Alizey’s ceremony first and 
then later we will do Afnan’s too. Brother, you wanted to do separate 
ceremonies for Alizey and Afnan? yes, that is right, 
they are not married yet, it doesn’t look appropriate that
they sit together for the ceremony. Look Afsheen, I find it appropriate that the engagement ceremony 
should be done separately. okay, brother, as you wish. Stay blessed. You have always kept my word. Afnan, go sit with your friends, 
we will do your ceremony later. Okay Dad. You call the ladies and 
start the ceremony, okay? Okay. What is this, mom? Uncle has never said 
such a thing ever before, I don’t want to get the ceremony 
done like this. Shut up and sit Alizey, I guess you are forgetting 
that you were his niece and now you are her daughter-in-law-to-be. Obviously, whatever traditions he will follow will be done 
with his daughter-in-law. Whatever it is mom, 
he is ruining my event. Don’t spoil your mood. Smile a little. Enough Fahad. Congratulations. You are having a lot of fun. I am regretting not being here when uncle must have stooped Afnan 
from coming here. Your mood must have been so off. I missed it. Do you have a phone? Yes. Give it to me. Yes Fahad? Alizey speaking. Has uncle stopped you from coming 
on the stage after the engagement as well? Umm, no, no, it’s not that, I am coming, why would he stop me? I am coming, okay? 
Don’t worry. Okay don’t get angry, 
I will go call him. Go. 
You come, come. Fix your mood, 
people are watching Alizey. Mom, I feel like going home right now. Uncle hasn’t done good to me. Afnan is coming, let me talk to him. Have you gone mad Alizey? You complain about brother to Afnan? No boy tolerates her wife to be 
to go against his family and that too at their engagement ceremony and you know it very well that 
how much Afnan respects brother. You won’t do anything like that. Alizey, please stay quiet for my honor, I will explain everything to you 
when we get home. Please, my love. Fix your mood, please. Hmm? What will we do? The rickshaw driver 
is asking for so much money. Let me do something wait. In fact, do one thing, call Shani and ask him to come here 
to pick both of us immediately. Both? How will we sit on one bike? We are skinny, we will manage, it’s not a big deal, we are helpless, we cannot pay that much 
to the rickshaw driver, call that lazy man, 
he will take hours to reach. He will take time to come because 
he is coming on the bike, not on an airplane. Don’t argue much, 
hurry up and call. I am. 
Wait. everyone is so dressed up here. Hello, brother actually… Sir Afnan, Mr Qasim is calling you, he wants to introduce you 
to some friends. okay, You may go, 
I am coming. I will be … 
What is this Afnan? After the entire event now you have come
and sat here and now we are getting pictures clicked, 
you are going again now? Look, all guests are looking at us, fix your expression and by the way, dad is calling me, it is not a problem. It’s our event Alizey, try to understand, if I and dad won’t attend the guests,
 who else will do it? Please fix your mood, I don’t have brothers 
who can talk to all of them, I have to look after all of them, I am just going and 
I will be back in 5 minutes. Okay. Your brother hasn’t come yet, 
I don’t think he will come, let’s do one thing, let’s go out 
and get a rickshaw. And what if he comes? If he will come then he will get home, it’s more important for us to get home
 right now. Let’s go. Come to this side, 
all the rickshaws are here. I don’t understand that if they didn’t 
want to come with me then why did they call me? Annie was telling that they got a rickshaw
right after calling you, Annie didn’t have a package 
to make calls and ramsha’s phone’s battery 
was already dead so she couldn’t talk to you. Anyway, they are home now, 
don’t get angry. Whatever it is, I got so perplexed. So what? If you got a little perplexed, what is the harm in getting a little trouble 
for your sister? Thank god that you got informed, what if you wouldn’t have found 
the rickshaw? Whatever it is, mom, I am telling you this for one last time today, I don’t want to see Annie going out 
with Ramsha anywhere again. Ramsha can do whatever she wants but any won’t go with her. Just know that. By the way, to be honest, Shani is absolutely right. The situation is not good these days, we have to be very careful. Now look, girls are returning back such late at night, you must be a little careful. The girls told me that the event will end soon, 
before 9 to 10 o clock, you know if I knew this, 
I would have never let the go, anyway, I will be careful next time. Get me the electricity bill. I will get it. I will ask some boy from the shop 
to get it paid. I will get it. 
What have I got? Mom, I ma surprised how can uncle 
change so much so quickly? I feel he has already accepted me 
as his daughter in law that is why he is putting 
so much restrictions on me. I mean why is he putting 
so much restrictions on me. What has brother done that
 you are getting so angry? Why are you feeling so bad Alizey? Even if he had gotten his son engaged 
out of the family, so he would have behaved 
the same way with that girl too. Every in laws want their daughter in law to be to adjust according to their mindset 
so what’s new in this? Yes, it is new for you because your uncle has 
never been strict to you as an uncle but now he is about to be your father in law and you must understand that. Obviously you will favor him 
because you are his sister. What is this behavior, Alizey? He is the same uncle because of whom 
we are living a peaceful life. If brother wanted, he could have brought any strange girl 
and made her his daughter in law but he didn’t do that. He has always prioritized my happiness
 and your wish. Now I don’t want to listen to a word 
against brother from your mouth. You know what is the problem 
with your generation? If we scold you a bit or be a little strict, you guys forget all the previous love 
and favors and you guys start considering 
your elders as your enemies. I am getting tea made, change this, take that tea and go to your uncle he will like it. Look, Ramsha’s video has gotten viral, check out her views, millions of views. Why are they all standing here? Ramsha, Ramsha, Ramsha? What happened? 
Why have you guys crowded here? The famous girl. You don’t know? no, your video has gone viral. Oh ho!
I? Which video? Show me. 
see. Look at this. oh my God. People are properly discussing this video.
Look at this. Oh my God, Annie.. But you will take a picture with me first so that people know that 
we are best friends. I am so happy. Show me 
how many likes are there? So many likes and look at the views 
they are so many. 2 million man, 2 million. Mom? come quickly, 
Annie come quickly. Mom? What happened? Mom, I am so happy today, so happy
that you can’t even imagine. Oh, what happened? I have gotten the biggest happiness
 of my life. Really? So that means my daughter got 
her result, right? And you have passed 
with a very good score? Oh! Mom, no, it was the old times when the result 
used to be celebrated, we get happy for different reasons nowadays. Ok then tell us something? Annie, you tell us, 
she will just keep on screaming. Mom, aunt, Ramsha’s video has gone viral. Hmm. 
What video has gone viral? Yes mom, that video that I showed you
 of shopping the other day? It has gone viral, 
I have gotten millions views on it. Mom, everyone was after me 
at the university today, everyone took so many pictures with me, so many selfies that 
you cannot even imagine. You know the girls who wouldn’t 
even talk to me and didn’t know me, even they got pictures with me. Your daughter is famous now. Tell me what is there to be 
so happy about? Yes? What do you guys know? I have become so famous that people 
know me by the name of shopping girl now. And you know that Hania was telling me all her cousins 
are my fans now, everyone wants to meet me. Annie, tell them how much protocol did I get 
in the university today? yes aunt, every girl was looking for Ramsha and everyone was giving her so much 
importance like she is an actual celebrity.
