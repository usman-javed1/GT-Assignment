Mom, what is this? Actually, Shani’s sister is getting married so Shani is here to get
Ramsha’s jewellery. Oh, by the way, if there was a shortage
of money at your end, you could have just asked Mom. Mom is very generous with
charity for all such things. That is not needed. That’s strange, accepting charity would have been
better than begging. Yes, Alizeh is right by the way and you have made a
huge sacrifice anyway, after all your ex-wife has lived here, and spent time here, so this is your right. You must mind your tongue. I am standing in your house
that doesn’t mean you can say whatever you want to. Hey, what did mom say? She is right,
she is just stating the truth. Now, you guys have married Ramsha
in this house so you can take advantage
out of it, right? Actually, you still haven’t
understood us, we don’t make relationships based
on richness and poverty, we are poor but not shameless. Oh, oh, you are so shameful, you would have been shameful had
you kept your cousin locked in 4 walls instead of leaving her to have an affair
with married men at other people’s homes. What? What are you doing? If you say a word more about
my family, I won’t spare you and would
cut your throat! What? 
What is he doing? I feel like slaughtering her here but I have just stopped my hand
because of Ramsha. Put this down,
it can hurt her. You can take whatever
you want from this house, we won’t say anything but put this down, please. Please. Mom, who is this animal kind of a man? Call the police, don’t let him go. Where is the groom’s family? 
They didn’t come yet. I have just spoken to your Uncle, they will be here anytime, 
he has gone to pick them. Where is Shani? Shani.. Umm, I am Shani’s mother but 
what do you need from Shani? Look, I have an arrest warrant
against Shani. I want to take him. But what has Shani done? Why are you here to arrest him?
What is his crime? Look, you have a function 
going on in your house and I don’t want any chaos 
or forcefulness. Call Shani. Shani? Shani? Who is Shani here? What happened Aunt? Is that Shani? So you are Shani? Yes, I am Shani. I have a warrant against you and I am here to arrest you. What have I done? You know madam Afsheen 
and Alizeh? They have filed 
an FIR against you. FIR for breaking in their house
 and attempting to murder. I am arresting you and 
taking you with me. catch him. No, no, how can you just take him? Let’s go. 
Brother? Brother? Where is your Dad? Quiet. Quiet. Have patience. 
Mom. Annie, Annie, stop. Annie, 
we need to take care of Aunt, stop Hello? Hello? 
Where are you? Quickly come home. 
What is going on? Police have arrested Shani. Afnan, this boy should get 
the strictest punishment. How dare he barge into our house 
and torture us. He has broken everything, thank God that God saved my daughter 
from that monster else he would have killed us. When so much has happened, you should have at least 
called me once. And how did you even let him 
enter home? We didn’t call her, I think your beloved wife sent her. It was all her plan as well. Afnan, if anything happens 
to my child, I will never forgive you. You get him arrested. Afnan, he should get the strictest 
of punishment. Nothing will happen to our child. Don’t you see how scared 
my daughter is. Go away, everyone will see. Go. Why are you acting so pious? Did you forget your past? I knew it, I knew very well about 
your shallowness. Yes, I am shallow, 
you got it right, and after marriage you will realize 
I am not shallow I am even pathetic. I remember each
and everything. And I will take revenge for each 
and everything. Is that how you treat your wife? Whose wife is it? Mine right? So I don’t understand why you have
so much sympathy for her? she is my wife, and I will do what I want. If she is your wife, 
consider her like one, stop treating her like animals. If she doesn’t listen to you 
then explain it to her with love, locking her in the room is 
not good behavior, God forbid, if something 
happens to her. So what? Maximum what? 
She would have died? Everyone has to die. By the way I am both surprised 
and a I feel a bit sad for you, because I thought 
you are her only lover but there are more here. Shut the hell up. If you said one dirty word 
about Ramsha’s character, I will pull off your tongue. And you think I am wearing bangles? I won’t do anything in return? 
Hey? For God’s sake Shani, quiet,
go away Shani, Go. Mom, ask him to leave. Shut up, I am asking you to leave. Go away. Afnan? If you are here to defend 
your ex-husband, then don’t even say a word. How dare he? How dare he enter my house 
and break things? Keep a dagger on my wife’s neck 
and try to kill him? Thank god I wasn’t home, Alizeh and Aunt just filed an FIR, 
if I was here I would have killed him. At least listen to me once, Afnan. Whatever has happened wasn’t 
just Shani’s fault, he told Uncle himself that 
he came here to get the jewellery, Aunt and Alizeh provoked him 
so much, so much so that he took this step. Come on, please, don’t tell me these fake stories 
of Shani? What are you trying to say? What are you trying to say that 
Alizeh gave her the dagger and ask him to keep it on my neck? We know how big of a goon he is but I am going to take all 
the goon out of him today. Afnan, you think once yourself, he has a wedding going on 
in his house, his sister has her Henna ceremony
 going on, and he has guests in his house, why would he pick up this day 
to create this show? He could have done all this 
some other day, cool down and think no matter 
how big of an enemy you have, you wouldn’t at least do this on 
your sister’s wedding day. I just want that you can take whatever 
legal actions you want to take against Shani, but just let Annie get married once, 
please. Ramsha, you… What? What are you saying, inspector? Shani got his bail and
that too so soon? Inspector, I guess you are forgetting that he has a case of attempt 
to murder my daughter and it is not some small case, you tell me who got him bailed? Mom. Where is Afnan? Rasheeda was telling me he has 
gone out somewhere, I have been calling him for so long 
that he is not even taking my call. By the way, why are you asking? Is there something? Shani has been bailed. What? But mom you were saying 
you have filed such a case that he will have to suffer 
in prison all his life, it hasn’t even been one night. Go and ask this to your husband because Afnan got him bailed. Afnan? What? What are you doing? If you say a word more 
about my family, I won’t spare you and would 
cut your throat! What? What is he doing? I feel like slaughtering her here but I have just stopped my hand 
because of Ramsha. Put this down, it can hurt her. You can take whatever 
you want from this house, we won’t say anything but put this down, please. 
Please. Alizeh, you are still awake? 
You haven’t slept yet? When a wife has a husband like you, how can she sleep peacefully? What rubbish? I am absolutely right, I used to think you are careless 
about me but turns out 
you are feelingless too. When was I feelingless now, Alizeh? If this is not being feelingless 
then what is it? The person who tried to kill me, you got him bailed? Look Alizeh, I understand your anger but I was helpless to get 
Shani’s bail. You were not helpless, you got him bailed because 
Ramsha asked you to. Afnan, learn something
from Ramsha, learn to fulfill relationships 
from her, Ramsha is better than you who is 
still ready to die for her ex-husband. Just shut up! There is no need to be angry at me, if you want to ask, ask your wife, ask her why is she dying after Shani. Did you forget how cruel and brutal 
you were to Ramsha. How can you come here 
and tell me today that I am doing wrong to him 
though you don’t even know anything You are right, what I did to her I am being 
punished for it and regretting but I want that you don’t repeat 
the same mistake I made. I am regretting too, Shani, I regret falling in love with Ramsha. I regret always protecting her. I regret making her the honor of this 
house and bringing her into this house, I have a warrant against you and I am here to arrest you. What have I done? You know madam Afsheen 
and Alizeh? They have filed 
an FIR against you. FIR for breaking in their house and attempting to murder. I am arresting you and 
taking you with me. catch him. No, no, how can you 
just take him? Let’s go. 
Shani. Thank God, that Afnan got you bailed else we wouldn’t be able 
to face anyone. We have made Annie’s in laws 
understand after so much difficulty. By the way who asked you to go
 beg Afnan to get me out of there? Yeah? What would have happened 
if I had spent two nights in jail? It wasn’t the end of the world. Are you in your senses? Your sister has her wedding 
after two days and how would it look that sister is getting married and 
the police are taking the brother, do you have any idea what the hell we were going through, I thank God that Afnan got you bailed else your sister’s home would have 
destroyed before even being made, we are saved from the humiliation. Enough mom, there is no need to take 
this useless favor from them. When I am telling you 
I didn’t do anything wrong and they were the ones 
who did wrong? So what was the problem? They would have taken us 
to the court. The court would have let me go. Because I didn’t do anything wrong. But no, we want to take 
favors from them. Shut up, Shani. There are some things, 
if they don’t get done in time, then it doesn’t matter 
if they get done or not. And yes, listen, your Dad has said you won’t go anywhere out, he will take care of all 
the outside chores and you will look after 
the chores inside the house. What is this, now? I don’t know, your Dad told me this, 
so I informed you, now go argue with him, not me. Won’t go out? What strange things are 
they saying?
