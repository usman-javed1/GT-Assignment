Afnan? Afnan? 
Hmm? Get up Afnan? Get up. Mom is waiting for us at breakfast. Sit here. We are getting late, come, mom is...
Sit. yes, what is it? What are you looking at? I feel like looking at you like this. Afnan? We have our whole life 
to talk romantically, for now, let’s go mom is waiting. We will go in a while. Afnan, we will get let, lets’ go. No, I said in a while. Okay, our event went so well yesterday, right? Hmm. It was fun, right? 
Hmm. there was just one thing that 
I panicked about, when Ramsha all of a sudden fainted 
and fell down. I felt I don’t know what happened to her, 
I couldn’t even understand. Imagine, someone faints like 
that at our event. Afnan, are you listening to me? Yes, I am, what else should I say? It is even possible that she might be 
missing her mother because a person always misses their 
beloved people at every happy occasion. What do you think? What will I think? Alizeh, I don’t have that much time 
to think about her. If you want to know so much, 
you must go ask herself. Okay I will ask her. 
what is wrong with you? Are you mad? Look, she might have fainted due 
to some trauma, if you question her about it, 
she will relive the trauma, why do you want to her feelings? Try to understand this maturely. You will never ask her why she fainted,
ever again, okay? Okay fine, I am not saying
anything to her, but at least this helped 
in getting you up. Shall we go now? yes, let’s go. 
Come. Madam Ramsha? Oh God, have mercy. Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha? Thank you. Ramsha, my child, the people who agrees in God’s will, 
they live happily, the one’s who agree with His will 
have a higher position. Everything that God does is for good 
and is according to his will. If you agree with Him, your heart will be at peace, 
you will prosper. Thank God. Who teaches you all this, uncle? God, the Greatest one. I used to think like you as well, 
like we generally get thoughts. The hear becomes small, when you don’t get something you like, the heart becomes uneasy, why didn’t this happen? Why didn’t it happen 
the way I want? So, then I just found people 
who follow the path of God and then I took baby steps towards 
the path of religion and started learning gradually. The knowledge of religion has a 
lot of blessings. Uncle, I want to learn the knowledge 
of religion too. Even I want to live a 
satisfied life like you. I even want to have faith 
in God like you do. I want to live such life too. If God wills, If God wills. When I started to walk on this path and start learning about religion, 
I felt a very solid change, I felt nice. When you walk on the path of religion and study religion, your faith on God increases. Faith on God. The one who has faith on God, all the fears go away from their life. Don’t worry, there is this organization, an academy for ladies where the teach the deeper grasp over Islamic knowledge
and regulations to attain the Islamic way of life, I will speak to them if you can get 
admission there. Yes, that would be great, I will also get busy that way, uncle, I want to get busy anyway. I am tired of fighting myself, please get me an admission 
at your earliest. Why do you fight yourself Ramsha? My child, remember, forgive yourself before 
forgiving anyone then you will get peace and prosperity. Brother Saad’s wife look after 
that organization, she is the head there, 
so I will talk to her and get your admission there, 
if God wills. No, Afnan, Afnan, don’t leave me. Please don’t leave me Afnan, don’t go. Afnan, wait. Afnan, no. Afnan, Afnan, stop. Stop Afnan. No Afnan, no. No, Afnan, no, no. Afnan, you cannot do this to me, Afnan, Afnan, stop, Afnan stop, no. Afnan? Afnan? Stop, stop Afnan, Afnan no, Afnan no. No, Afnan? Afnan? Afnan, stop. Afnan, no, stop. Stop Afnan, no, no. Afnan? Afnan, stop, stop Afnan, no, don’t do this, Afnan, stop please. Please stop Afnan? Afnan, Afnan? Afnan? Alizeh? You were taking Afnan’s name 
in your dream? Alizeh, actually I saw Afnan 
in my dream, it was a very bad dream. There was something very bad 
happening to Afnan, I was stopping him, I don’t know if the interpretation of 
my dream would be good or bad, you just give charity for him. Uncle was telling if you get a nightmare 
or you are in a problem, you should give charity and it makes 
that problem go away. You must give charity for Afnan. What did you see in your dream? What difference does that make? I mean, what difference does that make, it was a bad dream and we shouldn’t 
tell bad dreams to anyone. You just give charity for him, please. What are you doing? I am giving charity for you. You take this and give it 
to someone needy. Charity? What problem did you have 
all of a sudden? I am fine, then what was the need 
to give charity? I am fine, but I am so worried for you. Afnan, actually Ramsha had a very bad dream 
regarding you. She asked me to give charity for you. Ramsha had me in her dream? Okay and what else did she tell you? Did she say something else to you? No, she didn’t say anything else, the poor girl was very worried 
about her dream herself. Wonderful, Ramsha had a dream, she was worried and 
you are in tension? So, shouldn’t I get worried? It has been just a few days
 to our marriage, if something happens to you, 
what will happen to me? What are you even saying? You killed me on the second 
third day of marriage. God forbid. Nothing will happen to me, 
Ramsha is actually, look try to understand her background. Look, we don’t know where she is from and what story has she told, 
if that’s true or a lie. For now, we are believing her but that doesn’t mean that the dream 
she is telling would be true as well. She is telling you this dream today and then tomorrow she will give you 
another story so will you believe that too? No, right? Look such people are psychological 
patients, they are habitual of making stories, but we are intelligent people, 
we wouldn’t believe them, right? Don’t take it so seriously, okay tell me did you have breakfast? No, you come as well, 
let's have breakfast together. Okay fine, do one thing, 
you get there, I am coming. Okay, come. he is just my dad, you have no relationship with him 
so stop creating relationships, understand? I don’t want to argue with you, you may leave. 
I won’t leave, you will leave, not just from this room but this house, look, look, Ramsha, there have already 
been a lot of drama between us, everyone is sleeping right now, it’s a very good chance, quietly leave 
from here there won’t be any drama. I said I won’t go, can’t you understand it at once? It looks like you won’t understand. If you misbehave with me after this, I will go and tell uncle everything 
about our relationship. our event went so well yesterday, right? there was just one thing 
that I panicked about, when Ramsha all of a sudden fainted 
and fell down. I felt I don’t know what happened to her, I couldn’t even understand. Imagine, someone faints like that 
at our event. It is even possible that she might 
be missing her mother because a person always misses their 
beloved people at every happy occasion. What do you think? What will I think? Alizeh, I don’t have that much time 
to think about her. If you want to know so much, 
you must go ask herself. Okay I will ask her. A B C (Urdu) It is so difficult to pronounce H 
from the throat H. Madam you are reciting? Yes. Why what happened? 
Why are you laughing? What else should I do if not laugh?
I don’t understand. My 5-year-old daughter recites this and you are reciting this though 
you are much older. Madam Ramsha, you have never recited yet? I have recited multiple times, in fact, in my life I have recited 
so many times during Ramadan that now I have forgotten that 
how many times have I repeated it but now I am reciting correctly 
with all its qualities. With its qualities? Yes. It is the right to be recited with correct pronunciation
and proper qualities. Do you know the Islamic academy 
that I study in, there is a class dedicated 
for correct recitation so when I started taking that class, I realized that I made so many 
mistakes while reciting, I never knew how to pronounce 
a lot of alphabets so my teachers suggested me 
that I should recite so now they are teaching me 
how to recite. That’s okay madam 
but in this age? Tabassum, there is no age to get education or learn, God shows this path to anyone 
whenever He wants. And we should take advantage
 of that chance. Okay madam, when you are done 
learning with proper qualities, teach me as well. Definitely, if God wills. Afnan, I am getting ready, you get
ready in 10 minutes too else I won’t go. By the way Alizeh, this is very sad, I have been noticing that you have started being very cruel 
to your innocent husband after marriage. I am getting ready in a while, 
I am just going. Hey, you guys haven’t got ready yet? Mom, we will go when this Afnan 
gets ready. Afnan, get ready a little quickly, Alizeh’s uncle will get upset. He will feel bad if you go late. Aunt, you know it very well that I really avoid such events and gatherings, then why are you pushing me 
in to all this? Hey Afnan, these are the days, everyone invites you for such 
gatherings after marriage and everyone anyway wants you 
to be a part of their event. And you know I have a 
huge family of in-laws. Okay aunt, I will get ready, you… Bye. What happened to her? Aunt, then I am getting ready.
Yeah. She has joined the academy, even I felt weird when I saw her 
in the scarf for the first time. Anyway, it is her own choice 
what can I do? Its good, she is free all day at home, its good
she will get busy this way. Hmm, you go get ready 
you are getting late. Yes, I will go get ready.
 Okay mom. Look at this Annie, you know I wore this dress and 
was making a TikTok, I heard dad all of a sudden so I got scared,
I quickly went and changed. You were… You were wearing this? You will make a video in this? Yes, so? So? Are you out of your mind? 
If uncle gets a video, you will be in trouble. Mom, look at Shani, 
he is accusing me, I told you I went to a friend’s place?
I did tell you right? She is lying.
She was at a restaurant and she just didn’t have her friends there,
there were two boys there too. Ask her. What are you saying? Aunt I am not lying, 
my friend works there, he told me he saw everything. What is Shani saying?
Mom, he is lying. Before saying anything, 
do think properly that if this is a lie, 
it will be trouble for you and embarrassment for me. What is wrong with you Annie? Do you even know what people are 
doing these days just to make videos? Do you remember that girl 
who went viral on TikTok, she climbed a mountain to make 
a video and even lit a fire there. And do you remember 
what happened to her? She had to go to prison, 
then she even got dishonored. So what? We have to do anything 
to get viral today, we have to get dishonored too,
its not a big deal. I and modelling? 
How is that possible Hania? So what? What’s bad in it and what is the harm in shooting 
for one magazine? You can even hide this from 
your parents if you want because they are giving 
a very nice package. Come baby, come, you actually look very beautiful 
in this dress. Delicate, pretty just like the heroine of my drama. Just wait and watch, you will go very high after working 
with me in this drama. Very high. Don’t worry at all, 
I won’t do anything to you, I won’t do anything, 
I will kill you. Hania, Hania, stop him what is he doing? Hania? Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? Vicky no, Vicky no, you won't do anything like this, 
I am telling you. I am not a criminal, I am tired of saying this again and again,
I am not a criminal. Madam, you have been 
accused of a murder, you have attempted murder. I haven’t murdered anyone, 
this is a lie. This is a false allegation, 
I am not a criminal, I haven’t murdered anyone. 
Why don’t you guys understand this? Madam, don’t eat my head, have breakfast, you are one to say you didn’t murder, huh. Brother Sajid, what are you saying? How can she live here while 
my young daughter is present here, this girl doesn’t deserve to be 
kept in this house now. Salma, who are you to make my daughter
leave from my house? Sister-in-law why will we 
keep this girl here? Dad? Dad? Uncle? Dad… You shameless girl, because of you, because of you my fatherly brother left me, because of you, you are a murderer, you are a murderer of your father. we have to cross this road and go. Salma called she was saying 
Anwar has left to find us. Hurry up. 
mom, I am so scared. Nothing will happen. Hurry up. 
Okay let’s go. Mom? You know we ask God to give us 
a chance to offer prayers, we ask God to show us the right path, right? And any person, any person of God, when the repent with true heart so all these mistakes and sins are 
washed away you know how? Like we wash the clothes, 
properly drain them, or like we wash the dishes by sponge 
or a detergent or a powder, similarly, these tears that are shining
 in your eyes, they wash away the stains like this, if God sees two drops of tears 
in anyone’s eyes and if they offer prayers of forgiveness, 
God forgives them. It looks like I have seen you 
somewhere. There is a possibility I resemble 
to any of your relatives. Hey you are the same Ramsha whose video got viral by the name
of shopping girl? yes, I am the same Ramsha, , in fact, I have buried that Ramsha 
with all the bad traits a while ago. Great, you did a very good job, because we all commit sins, but not everyone has the courage 
to truly repent for those sins. May God give you ratification. Wow, both my nieces are sitting 
in front of me today. God has willed. Amazing. Ramsha, my child, I feel very nice looking this change in you, the knowledge is in your actions and only a few are blessed 
with this prosperity. You are lucky. Thank you uncle, thank God for giving me the chance, May God just help me walk this path. Amen. May God expand everyone’s knowledge. Thank You so much God, 
all praises are for God. Alizeh, I was thinking if you also join this Islamic Academy 
with Ramsha? That course of basic Islamic education, it will expand your knowledge too. There are a lot of such women’s problems that will be beneficial for you 
when you come across them. And trust me they explain it 
in a very easy manner, you will like it, what do you think? Uncle you know how my routine is, I am always so busy I don’t get time 
for anything else. Yes Alizeh, but you know they also give classes 
in the evening for two hours if you want … you can take that class 
if its suitable for you. Wow, Ramsha that’s very good advice. Alizeh, you get free at 6 from work so you can join the 7 to 8 class,
what do you think Ramsha? What do you say? Okay I will see uncle.
