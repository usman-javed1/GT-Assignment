I, Ramsha, do not want to marry you. Did you hear that? And have you ever seen yourself? Yeah? Have you ever seen yourself 
you look so weird, you don’t even know the ABCs of education, you uneducated man, just passing matric doesn’t make 
one educated. And how did you even think that I, such a beautiful girl will marry you? Actually I… 
Enough! Just shut up! Because when you speak, 
I feel pain in my ears. Have you seen yourself? You don't have the manners to talk,
 to sit or to walk! You have no manners at all and
 what do you wear? If you look at the boys from good families you will then know the way of 
speaking and sitting! Ramsha, I love you. To hell with your love, I have shown you your place 
in person today, next time if you even talk about love, I will humiliate you in front of everyone 
so that you will remember it for life. What did you say to Dad? If you think that I will get pressurized by him
and marry you then you are mistaken. Are you mad? Why would I say that to Uncle? Listen to me very carefully, I won’t marry you. Yes, so even I have no interest 
in marrying you. Okay enough now, I understand you very well. You know that no one is after you 
after all this dishonor, that is why you want to get with me. Are you mad? You know very well that I have 
no interest in you Shani, I can go through the pain of being 
dishonored but a trouble like yourself, may God never write such fate for anyone. I won’t even marry you if you are 
the last man in this world, understand? Alizey, what have you done to your room? Mom, I have to go to a party tomorrow, 
I cannot decide what should I wear, why don’t you help me and tell me 
which one looks nice? Does this look nice? Forget everything, tell me, 
when are you free? What? I need to take you to the boutique to 
buy the dresses for your wedding. What? My wedding? So just buy them at the time of wedding,
what is the rush? I and brother have decided that we will get you and 
Afnan married soon. Mom, don’t you guys have anything 
else to do? Whenever I talk to you about this,
this is the same response you give me and I have lot of work, but the most important of them all 
is to get married and listen Alizey, if you have no interest in 
your wedding shopping then tell me clearly, I will go alone and do all the shopping but this time I won't listen to you at all, just understand this. Ramsha? I have been watching you being 
on the phone for so long, Hey, I am calling sister Shiza. I spoke to her assistant Komal 
a few days ago but she is not taking my call now, I have been calling her for so many days, I even asked Komal to talk 
to sister Shiza about my job but she didn’t respond yet, I don’t know where are they busy. Do you think that the people of 
this channel will give you a job? Yes, 100%. You know what? When I went to 
sister Shiza’s morning show she gave me so much love and respect, she treated me like I was a superstar. I know that she will definitely help me. That was temporary, she needed ratings at that time, and now there must be other people 
in your place, this is how this field is, Four days of good times and 
then ensues bad times. You always talk about disappointment 
Annie and you make me disappointed to, at least some time say something
 encouraging, anyway, I am very sure that sister Shiza will 
definitely help me, you will see. But I am not, media people just know their own purpose 
and nothing else. Anyway, mom is saying she has kneaded the dough,
you go make flatbread. Okay. Who is it? It’s me Faizan from the shop, 
greetings sister. Greetings. Sister, the vehicle with the stock is here, we need to take out the cartons of oil, 
send brother Anwar, brother Shani is not at the shop. Okay I will send him, Quickly, there is a lot of footfall of 
the customers on the shop. There is a lot of footfall? But uncle and Shani were telling that there are no customers 
on the shop so there is no income from the shop 
then how did the footfall increase? What? Is that what brother Anwar tell you? Don’t say anything to brother Anwar,
he will fire me. Don’t worry, your name won’t be taken, you may go. 
Thank you sister. Sister just quickly send brother Anwar, I am going to the ship there are 
a lot of customers there. Your total is Rs3424. Looks like you got your committee 
this time. Yes? Your total is Rs 2700, okay. Yes? Bring it. Didn’t you make the receipt? Oh God. Go and get the receipt made. Hey? Ramsha, you? My child, if you wanted something, 
you could have asked me, I would have sent it, what was the need
 for you to come? I am here to see that how sincere our people are with me
after my dad passed away. What does that mean? You said that there is no stock in the shop
and there are no customers at all. But looking at the shop it doesn’t seem so. What are you looking at? Come on do your work. Go away, and you must go too, 
go, go home. Your widowed sister in law has 
a lot of trust in you, and that is how you choose to hurt 
the trust of two sincere women? Ramsha, there is no need to talk rubbish, go away and don’t talk nonsense. Let us work, go. Don’t you understand what dad is saying? Go away. I need the accounts of the shop. What? You need the accounts? You? Yes. Do one thing, come, come here, come sit here 
and take the calculations from us. If the time requires, I will do that too, there is nothing wrong with girls 
working nowadays. And by the way, a father’s business is taken care 
by their children only. Ramsha, there is no need 
to create a scene here, I am asking you to go home. Why? You really like watching 
mockery of people. You enjoy everyone’s mockery a lot and now when it’s your time 
you are feeling bad? Ramsha, don’t test my patience. Go, go away from here. I am going but this doesn’t end here. I will take accountability of everything, every penny. Sister in law, now your waiting period has ended too but you didn’t respond? Anwar asks me daily that what did sister in law think about it? Salma, to be honest I am unable to make a decision, you know that whatever Shani did to my daughter, after that my heart is not satisfied. Sister in law, Shani got sheered away and then he even apologized to you 
and me. Okay forget it, he made a mistake, look he is a kid, he grew up 
in front of you, you tell me, have you heard of anything ever about him since he was a child till,
he grew up, no, right? He just got sheered away 
and made a mistake like our Ramsha did. Leave it, forgive him and let it go and you just think about it and 
give me an answer then. I am here to see that how sincere our people are with me 
after my dad passed away. You said that there is no stock in the shop 
and there are no customers at all. But looking at the shop it 
doesn’t seem so. Your widowed sister in law has 
a lot of trust in you, and that is how you choose to hurt 
the trust of two sincere women? And by the way, a father’s business is taken care 
by their children only. Ramsha, there is no need 
to create a scene here, I am asking you to go home. You enjoy everyone’s mockery a lot and now when it’s your time 
you are feeling bad? don’t test my patience. Go, go away from here. I am going but this doesn’t end here. I will take accountability of everything, every penny. Shani? Shani? Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? What happened? Talk slowly, 
I can hear. What do you think you will make 
a mockery out of us, humiliate us and we will stay quiet? I haven’t humiliated you yet, I came back quietly from there, 
caring about the relationship we had else I would have told you. Else what would you do?
What would you do? Talk slowly Shani, you have made a mistake and 
then you are shouting at me? it is people like you who pressurize 
people to cover their mistakes. Pathetic. Listen to me carefully today, if I ever saw you at the shop ever again, I will break your legs. I Will break your hands if you 
even try to touch me, let alone breaking my legs. What will you do? You didn’t leave our honor 
in the neighborhood, at least let us work with honor. Hey, hey what happened? Ramsha, you go to your room, go,
go to your room. Shani, look my child, 
if there is anything, if there is a problem 
you can talk to me son. Aunt, what should I talk to you about 
you cannot even control your daughter, if you would have controlled her 
we wouldn’t have to see this day today. Enough Shani! Tell me what is it? tell me? Mom, ask her the one 
who is standing here. She went to the shop humiliated me,
humiliated dad, she was asking us for the accountability
 of the shop. So then why should I ask for it? I shouldn’t even ask for what is my right?
 It is my father’s shop, I will take the accountability of 
every penny from you. Your father is dead, 
do you understand? But I am alive, and until I am alive I will take accountability
 of each and everything, I have all the right on the shop. Shut your rubbish, do you understand? I won’t get scared of you shouting, 
do you understand? Sister in law, take her from here. And Shani, you also, go, go inside. Mom, if she says a word more, 
I am telling you it won’t be good for her. I don’t even expect anything good
from a pathetic man like yourself. Shani? Very good, very very good, in fact, what I say is that not just one slap, 
uncle should have slapped him twice. Quiet. Now I don’t even want to hear 
you voice in this house. Had there been any less havoc in here that you want more of the storm? And what was the need for you 
to go to the shop? If you hadn’t gone to the shop, 
all this wouldn’t have happened. Mom, both of them has been lying 
to us over and over again and you are telling me 
I shouldn’t go there? So what did you get? What did you get by going to the shop? Truth. The truth has unfolded. If I hadn’t gone there, I and you would have never found this out. Mom, we are so worried here, 
there is no money for my fee, and forget about the fee, we don’t even have the money 
for your medicine. Do you know that uncle is getting 
good income from the shop but he doesn’t have anything 
to give to us. It is my father’s shop, 
I have all the right over it, mom and uncle has captured it. Ramsha, he didn’t capture it. Mom this is called capturing, all the income that is being made is 
going in uncle’s pocket. We are not getting anything, not even the money to fulfill our needs, it is the limit mom, you are acting like you know nothing 
even after seeing everything. Whatever it is, Anwar you shouldn’t have raised your 
hand on your grown up son like this that too in front of everyone. So what else should have I done? What should have I done? Didn’t you see how Shani was misbehaving 
with sister in law? What was the need to get 
in fight with Ramsha? I thought that I will come home and talk to sister in law in my own way but the he ruined the whole matter. He is one hell of an emotional being, your son has no brain at all. What do you guys think? Is it easy to handle the shop alone 
after the death of brother? If I would have talked to sister in law my 
own way she must have understood as well. It is a strange matter, I work hard and then I ma the bad guy. Let bygones, be bygones, why are you worrying now? No, no, no, no, I am not worried, whatever I want will happen, I know how to turn the game in my favor, I am an old player, what player to move where and when, no one knows that better than me, to hell with sister in law and her daughter. I had to raise my hand on my grownup son, I wanted to ask him if it hurt bad? What happened was wrong. I was helpless, I had to do it. Listen to me, Shani, you will apologize to sister in law. I won’t apologize. why don’t you try to understand, remember Shani, if you don’t apologize … 
So what? You will hit me? Hit me but I won’t apologize. Do remember that your brain will destroy you one day and
along with that it will ruin us as well, listen to me and understand, sit there, sit down. Look Shani, try to understand the sensitivity of the matter.
I should understand? She needs to understand, the fool who is trying to take us 
in pressure. What? What is she doing? How did she put pressure on us? She just said that shop is hers, that business belongs to her, 
it is her fathers, nothing belongs to us, 
so what is wrong in it? What is wrong in it? That business is her and even that 
shop belongs to her, her father. Fear that day, she was just asking for the accounts
 of the shop today, in future she will ask the custody 
of the same shop and things won’t stop here Shani, who does this house belong to 
where you roam freely? Where you talk loudly? 
Who does this house belong to? Her, her mother, her father, nothing belongs to your father, if she throws her out of here, you won’t get anything, 
I won’t get anything either, we will be empty handed, empty. That’s why listen carefully to 
what I am saying, it is very important for you 
to marry Ramsha. My child, once you get married 
to Ramsha, and she becomes your wife, so everything that is hers will be yours, you will be the owner, that is why whatever I am saying, just consider it with cool mind on it, my child, if apologizing for a bit 
will make our life, if it will bring us benefit then what is the harm in it? Are you mad? You know very well that I have 
no interest in you Shani, I can go through the pain of being 
dishonored but a trouble like yourself, may God never write such fate for anyone. I won’t even marry you if you are 
the last man in this world. Aunt, I am embarrassed, I shouldn’t have done that, God knows 
what happened to me, I got angry but I promise you that 
I will never do this again. Shani, I feel like giving you a tight slap. Hey, enough Anwar, he is just a kid, he made a mistake, I have forgiven him, you also just let it be 
and forgive him. Sister in law this is your greatness 
that you are saying that else trust me, he has embarrassed me. I thought that once I collect some money I will give it to you all together so that 
it could be of some use to you because you don’t know where does 
the money go these days but I am very happy, Daughter Ramsha has done a huge favor, she did the right thing by making me realize, I have realized sister in law and I will assure you sister in law that there will be no injustice with you
in this house ever, everything will be the exact same like it 
used to be when brother Sajid was here, if God wills, just relax. What are you doing Salma? Get up and make tea, we will have the evening tea 
with sister in law today, go Salma, go, and listen, 
hold this money, go and get piping hot snacks 
from Iqbal’s shop, sister in law you know how much 
our daughter Ramsha likes snacks and if the snacks are from Iqbal’s shop, the taste of the evening tea gets doubled. Go and bring it, good boy. Sister in law, it’s just that I don’t know how to thank you 
for forgiving my child, you have won my heart, 
you did me a favor. Hey, Anwar, let it be, Shani is like my son too. That’s it. I will get water for you. Afnan, I wanted to talk to you about something, I want you to tell mom that you don’t want 
to get married so soon. Alizey, you think I am a fool that I should listen to such 
foolish demand from you? Afnan, mom will not listen to me, she will agree if you convince her. Please talk to her about it. I will not talk to her about anything 
like that please don’t force me. Not even for me? For you? Are you serious Alizey? Usually girls say that marry me 
for my sake, they cry, they beg, they request and you are telling me 
not to marry you for your sake? It’s unbelievable. Afnan, you are very selfish. 
I am selfish? You are selfish, who just care about her own life, 
her career, her social circle and her success but where am I in all this, Alizey? 
So what? Look if I will be strong and 
independent, it’s good for both of us, you will be so happy 
to see me as well. I don’t want anything from it. Afnan, are you going to refuse mom? 
I won’t talk to her and that’s it. Mom, you said yes to uncle? Ramsha, Shani has changed a lot, 
my child. Do you know he even took me 
to the hospital yesterday. Mom, just because he took you to 
the hospital means he has changed? What is wrong with you mom? What is this way that you have figured out 
to judge someone? Look Ramsha, Shani and Anwar has realized their mistake,
my child and Anwar has kept his word, he hasn’t given e any chance 
to complain by far, Anwar is regularly giving me money now and he comes and properly tells me 
all the accounts of the shop. Hey, he is even taking care of our expenses, I have no complaints from him, my child. Tell me something? They are our family, right? If we won’t trust them then 
who else will we trust? Just let it be mom, uncle Anwar can change so quickly? It is impossible, I know him very well, 
he is making us fool. Such mistrust is not healthy, my child. And I have to trust someone with you then why not Shani? He is family. Look, my child, just forget whatever happened. Once you get married to Shani you will stay here in front of 
my eyes in this house, whatever has happened, it is a blessing to get Shani’s proposal 
for marriage after that, my child. I want you to tell mom that you don’t
want to get married so soon. Alizey, you think I am a fool that I should listen to such 
foolish demand from you? Afnan, mom will not listen to me, she will agree if you convince her. Please talk to her about it. I will not talk to her about anything 
like that please don’t force me. Afnan, you are very selfish. I am selfish? You are selfish, who just care about her own life,
her career, her social circle and her success but where am I in all this, Alizey? 
So what? Look if I will be strong and 
independent, it’s good for both of us.
