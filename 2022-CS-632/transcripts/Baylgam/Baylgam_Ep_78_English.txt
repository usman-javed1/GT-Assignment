Did someone come to meet
you at the academy today? No, why? Yes, because I was thinking that your relatives
don’t come to meet you at home, so there is a possibility that any of your relatives came to
meet you at the academy. No one came to meet me Afnan. And I don’t have any relative
in this world now anyway, so someone’s presence
and absence doesn’t make any difference to me. What happened? Whose call was it? I don’t know someone is bothering me, I am getting calls from an
unknown number again and again. Okay, give it to me, I will talk. No Afnan, I will block it right now, there is no need to talk. Excuse me sir, these are some files, I need signs on them, Mr. Vaya needs to do
the meeting by today only. Excuse me, Sir? Sir? Afnan Sir? Sir, he is waiting, when should I call him
for the meeting? Hey dude, I don’t want
to do any meeting. Take this file away, why are you standing
on my head with it? Go and cancel my rest
of the meetings as well. Why are you looking at me like this now?
Can’t you hear me? Just get out of my office. Sir. Yes, I am talking about Ramsha, what were you talking to her about? Who are you to ask me that? She is a friend, it is up to me whatever I say to her. What? She is your friend?
She is your friend? She is more than a friend. Why should I tell you? Mind your own business. Do you understand? Ramsha? Greetings. Greetings. What are you doing here? Yes, actually there was
prediction of rain so I took an early off from the office, mom was telling me that
you are in the academy and driver is not available
so I thought of picking you up. Yes, looking at the weather
it seems like it will rain, it’s good, the weather
will become cooler. Yes, look there is prediction of rain. Thank God you came in time else I would have had to wait for you. Let’s go. Let’s go. Thank you. Ramsha? I, I, I won’t go, I won’t go. Come out. Leave me. Come out. Alizeh? Leave me. Ramsha? Alizeh? Hurry and come. Quickly. I will give you whatever you want but don’t take her. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go. Ramsha? Say something Alizeh. Work is done. Your planning has been successful. My planning doesn’t get successful, that is impossible. I told you that you don’t have to take
Ramsha’s tension. You were absolutely right, mom. There wouldn’t be any use of
getting Ramsha out of this house, because she would have still
stayed in the hearts of this family but now, she will also
be out of this house and the hearts of this family. That is exactly what
is going to happen. You were tensed too Afsheen, I gave you support, kept you in this house and didn’t let you feel
deprived of anything, do you remember? Brother, I am your biological sister. Ramsha is my daughter. These so-called relationships
have no value. For me, they have value. You attacked Ramsha, right? I recognized your car. It was you, right? Yes, I was the one who attacked her but she has very good luck
that she got saved, it won’t happen next time,
I promise you. Alizeh, you want to kill her? Mom, if it was in my control, I would kill her right here right now because if she is alive, I and Afnan can never be happy. Ramsha? I, I, I won’t go, I won’t go. Come out.
Leave me. Come out. Alizeh? Leave me. Ramsha? Alizeh? I will give you whatever you want but don’t take her. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go. Ramsha? I cannot believe that brother compared me to Ramsha, the tone he spoke to me in, he never spoke to me like this, he is the same brother who would give his life for me. That is why I have been
so worried for so many days, this girl, this Ramsha has changed everything. She even changed brother, brother is not the same anymore. Yes, brother? Greetings, may peace be upon you. Greetings.
Did Ramsha come back? No brother, Ramsha hasn’t come yet. Ramsha hasn’t come yet?
It has been so late, call and check with Jam-shed. Greetings. Greetings. Umm, brother Jamshed even went to the academy and we even called her, she is not attending and she is not even in the academy. If she not there then… Brother, she might have
gone to meet her aunt. Call and ask. Alizeh, dial their number. Umm yes, I will call. Umm, she is not picking up the call, Uncle. She even has a cousin, what is her name? Annie. Yes, Annie, Annie,
call on her number. I have her number, I will call. Call and let me know. Dad, she is not receiving the call. There might be network issue
as it is raining very heavily. May God keep things well, how is this possible? Afnan? Afnan? Where are you going? Don’t worry brother, she will come back in a while. You are telling me that she is not even in the academy and you are telling me
that I shouldn’t even worry, amazing! May God keep things well. Afnan, wait. Afnan, wait. Where are you going? To look for Ramsha. It is raining so heavily outside, how can you go
out in this weather? Hey, what is wrong with you? Ramsha has been
missing for so long and please get out of my way, I will find her at any cost. Afnan, at least listen to me. Afnan, listen to me. What is it? I won’t let you go out in this weather. Are you out of your mind? Why don’t you understand
what I am saying? Don’t come in my way now, I have to find Ramsha
under any circumstances because my heart and mind is not in my control right now. Please, don’t come in front of me. Afnan? Ramsha has put this mud, right? I saw it on her hands. No, no, you are getting it wrong, you have some sort of
misunderstanding. I am not getting anything wrong, I couldn’t even imagine that you can stoop so low. You guys have crossed
all the limits. What rubbish? It is no rubbish, I am telling the truth, you are spending time with that
pathetic woman leaving your wife behind? Shut up. Just shut up. If you say another
disgusting word after this, I won’t spend a moment
after that with you. Mom, brother Afnan is here. Afnan, here at our home? Yes, I have seated him. Make him sit. I made him sit, come. Let’s go. Greetings. Greetings, son, Afnan, you here? At this time? Is everything well? Actually… I, I will go make tea. Go. Aunt, Actually I wanted to ask that Ramsha has gone to the
academy since morning, she hasn’t come home yet. Did she come here? No, son, she didn’t come here. Had she come here, I would have called you
and told you myself. Do one thing, call and ask her yourself. Yes, I have tried calling her
multiple times since morning but her number is switched off. I don’t know where did she go. She ran away with her lover. You shut up. By the way I am surprised and a bit sad for you as well, about the fact that I thought you are her only lover, but there are more here. Shut up! I’ll pull your tongue if you say one bad
word about Ramsha’s character. And you think
I am wearing bangles here? I won’t do anything in return? Hey? Yeah? For God’s sake, quiet, go away from here, Shani, go. Ask him to leave from here. Shut up, I am asking you to leave, go away from here. Go. Son, you know Shani’s temperament, he gets angry very quickly so you should have been very careful, this is not a battlefield but my home. Yes, you are right, I am sorry. Where am I? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Where have you brought me?
Who are you guys? Is anyone here? Can you hear me? Get me out of here. Where am I? Can anyone hear me? Why is no one listening to me? Is anyone here? To help me? Is anyone here to help me? Can anyone hear me? If someone can hear
me open the door, someone help me.
Is anyone here? Oh God, no one is listening to me, I don’t know what they
will take from me. Why is no one listening to me? can anyone hear me? Is anyone here? Is anyone here? Is anyone here to help me or not? Why have you brought me here? Is anyone here to help me? Is anyone here? Is there anyone outside,
can anyone hear me? Can anyone listen to my voice? Why have you kept me here? Get me out of here. Get me out of here. How can Ramsha go
anywhere without informing? She is a responsible girl, she is not careless. This is not possible, she is definitely in some trouble, or difficulty and my heart is sinking thinking about it. Hey brother, please control yourself. Alizeh has just called all
her academy friends but there is no clue about
Ramsha anywhere. Don’t worry, Afnan will come some news
with him by the grace of God. What did you say that Afnan will come with
some information? Why don’t you say that he will bring Ramsha along,
by God’s will? Afsheen? Do you know something? Tell me? I? What will I know, brother? I am already so worried for her. Look Afnan has called now. Hello, Afnan? Any information about Ramsha? Okay fine. No brother, no information about
Ramsha anywhere. Okay, then we must go to the
police and file a complaint. Hey brother, there is no need. There is no use of
complaining to the police. I, I know it very well that she has left by her own
choice from here. I had doubts on her already, the way she used to be
on call for hours, I am sure she left with that guy. Afsheen, Ramsha is
not that kind of girl, and what do you just keep on saying? I am sure she is in some trouble and if you don’t want to help me, then don’t, I will go myself. Brother, why do you forget her past? If you will tell her past to the police, they will also laugh at us. We will be defamed for no reason. Why do you forget brother, she ran away from
her house the same way? How can you jeopardize the honor
of your home for a stranger girl? Quiet Afsheen!! She is not some stranger. And why don’t you forget her past? God forgives but human beings don’t. And I haven’t just called
her my daughter, I have also accepted her
as my daughter. And a father never leaves his
daughter alone in hard times. Jamshed, take out the car. Br.. brother… Jamshed? Greetings, may peace be upon you. Greetings. I wanted to file a report. Go there in front. Okay. Mr. Constable, Mr. Constable. What is it? What is your problem, uncle? You scared me. You don’t even let us
sleep in peace. I guess you are forgetting
you are in duty. Yes, I know I am at the duty. I am a human being,
we can fall asleep. Uncle, I am at the duty that is why I am present here else I would have gone home
and slept peacefully. Why are you standing quietly? Now tell me what is the work? People can’t sit at home
in peace even in this weather. I want to file a report. Want to file a report. Who kept this here? They don’t even leave my pen. Whoever wants, they take pen from my table. Areeb? Areeb? Get up. Go and get piping hot tea from me ... ...from the Pathan hotel
that is open outside. He already ruined my sleep and woke me up half asleep. Pen, for the report. Now why are you standing
on my head? Sit down. I am already sleepy. Okay, Uncle, sit down, I will wash my face
and come back, if I keep on sitting,
I will be yawning from sleep. They just come. There is no use of
complaining to the police. I, I know it very well that she has left by her own
choice from here. I had doubts on her already, the way she used to be on call for hours, I am sure she left with that guy. Why do you forget her past? If you will tell her past to the police, they will also laugh at us. We will be defamed for no reason. Why do you forget brother, she ran away from her house
the same way? Look my child, 
I promised your late Mother, may God forgive her, that you are my responsibility, I wanted to keep you in my home and marry you from here 
like my daughter, but I guess there is something 
else in the fate. I think that it is better for this house
 if you leave from here. You are Mr. Qasim, right? Yes, greetings,
 may peace be upon you. I didn’t recognize you. I offer prayers in the same mosque, I have heard you speak 
about religion often there, you speak really well,
 by the grace of God. Thank you, 
Thank you so much. May I know why have
 you come here? Did you have some work? Yes, I wanted to file a report. So are you done filing it? Umm your officer has 
gone to wash the face. What do you mean? He has just woken
 up from sleep, he will just get freshen up and come write 
the report then. Greetings, Sir, 
you here at this time? Do you come here 
to sleep or do your duty? Sorry Sir. To hell with your sorry, if I ever hear that you 
are sleeping again, I will suspend you, 
do you understand? You file the report and then meet me before leaving, Okay, thank you. Uncle, you complained about me, you shouldn’t do that. Mom, what will happen now? What if Uncle finds out 
we are behind all this, then? Alizeh, please, for God’s sake don’t
 say such things. I am already getting 
a very bad vibe. He wouldn’t find anything. I guess you are forgetting, Uncle has gone to the 
police station to file a complaint right now. So what? And brother has gone to 
the police station for formality, that is it. Mom? Now what? But what if police actually
 work this time? Alizeh, you are tensed, right? Please there is no need 
to give me tension, you just stay quiet for a while, please.
