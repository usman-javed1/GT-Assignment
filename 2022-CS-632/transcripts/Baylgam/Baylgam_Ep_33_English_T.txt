[40.96] What happened, mom?
[42.48] You look worried?
[44.44] Yes,
[46.92] sister-in-law’s phone
is constantly off,
[50.80] and Ramsha’s phone
isn’t going through as well.
[52.44] I asked sister-in-law to call
me as soon as she reaches there
[56.04] but there is no call from them.
[58.32] What do you know,
[61.16] they might have changed
their numbers because of Dad.
[64.88] Probably, but
[66.60] they should have called once
using anyone’s phone.
[72.28] Aunt must have not
called to be careful
[74.92] because whatever dad did,
[76.80] after that she would never want him
[78.20] to find out anything about Ramsha
[80.60] or to avoid any more trouble.
[86.52] Yes,
[91.60] I guess that is the reason.
[97.32] Don’t worry mom,
[99.04] wherever Ramsha and aunt
[100.36] must be they will be fine.
[103.48] I hope that is how it is.
[108.20] I have shared a lot of happiness and
sorrow with sister-in-law,
[114.60] without her and Ramsha this house
[119.64] is actually feeling very empty.
[122.64] True,
[124.20] there is so much emptiness
in the house without them.
[303.88] What are you doing here?
[305.08] Do you have any work?
[306.40] Where is the doctor?
[307.88] The doctor is in the OT,
[309.08] you must go to your
room right now, please.
[329.84] My child, how is she now?
[331.24] Stop,
[333.28] there is no need to show sympathy,
[342.76] it is because of you that my mother
is in this condition today,
[345.88] just because of you,
[348.52] what do you think?
[350.28] You will not be forgiven, ever.
[353.60] My child, I was…
[354.64] I told you I don’t need
sympathy from you.
[363.84] Just because of you today
my only support system,
[366.52] my mother is lying here
in this condition.
[373.92] I will never forgive you.
[379.64] Go away from here, go.
[404.36] So, you finally thought of me?
[405.92] Yes, I did,
[408.60] but you never thought of me,
[411.00] by the way, you are very
stubborn, Alizeh.
[412.92] And what are you?
[414.24] Selfish.
[419.52] You left without even telling me.
[421.56] You saw me leaving,
[424.08] you could have asked
me if you wanted to
[429.08] but no, you are you.
[432.16] Why should I ask you
[433.72] when you didn’t tell me yourself
then why would I ask you?
[439.92] Have you ever left without
telling me ever before
[442.20] that you went to Islamabad now?
[443.80] Even you never fought
with me like this before.
[446.80] Don’t say wrong things, Afnan,
[448.12] I didn’t fight with you,
[449.76] do you remember your words?
[451.68] I didn’t fight with you at all,
[454.12] I just asked you a question.
[456.08] You didn’t just ask a question,
[458.08] you put an allegation on me.
[463.72] I didn’t expect this from you Afnan.
[466.12] okay now forget all this,
[468.32] else we will have a fight again.
[473.52] Okay tell me,
[475.28] it has been so many days,
you didn’t miss me?
[477.12] I didn’t miss you at all.
[479.04] See, that’s what you do to me.
[482.44] Now what can I do if I don’t miss you?
[484.20] Should I forcefully miss you?
[543.32] You shouldn’t have behaved
like this with Mr. Qasim.
[547.32] Today, I and my mother are lying
here in this hospital because of him,
[550.96] he is my culprit,
[552.44] whatever I did is right.
[554.68] Madam, we see all this here daily,
[561.40] there is some sort of accident daily,
[563.52] injured and sometimes dead
bodies are also brought here
[571.68] but the one who commits the
accident always runs away,
[575.44] this is the first time in my
career that I have seen this,
[582.28] Mr Qasim hasn’t just accepted
his responsibility,
[585.04] in fact he made sure there
is no slacking in your or your mother’s treatment.
[596.48] No one even takes such
care of their own people
[599.20] the way Mr. Qasim has taken
care of you and your mother
[608.20] and even after so
much happened
[610.72] you didn’t even care
about his age or status,
[618.84] do you even know who he is?
[622.32] He is a renowned
businessman of this city,
[624.96] he can even get you arrested for
this misbehavior,
[632.20] you should be thankful that he
a kindhearted and a noble man,
[636.72] he didn’t just spend his money on
you but even gave you his precious time,
[641.36] who does that nowadays?
[647.08] Anyway,
[648.84] now you are better than before,
[650.68] you may go home,
[651.60] and my apologies if you felt bad
about anything I said. You are better…
[654.00] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[655.60] Greetings. Sir, doctor
has discharged her.
[659.52] okay, I have… yes..  thank you.
[662.36] I have spoken to the doctor, my child,
[665.36] he is discharging you,
[667.52] so please give your house
address or any contact number.
[676.92] Or if you want to call your relatives,
you can call them here.
[687.24] You tell me where did you want to go,
[689.88] I can drop you there.
[694.04] Actually, I even wanted to
apologize to your family,
[698.16] I will take full responsibility
of your mother’s treatment,
[701.24] I will talk to the doctor.
[702.04] I have misbehaved so
much with you, right?
[704.48] No, my child, you don’t
have to say anything,
[707.80] I am responsible for
your mother’s condition.
[718.32] You give me your address,
[729.72] I will drop you there.
[732.12] Where do you live?
Where do you reside?
[742.76] Umm, actually, umm,
[748.28] I don’t have anyone in this
world except my mother.
[756.32] I mean any relative or acquaintance,
uncle or aunt etc? Anyone?
[768.96] No one.
[773.72] After my father’s death,
[779.04] mom is my only support.
[786.92] We used to live in a rented house
[789.64] and they asked us to leave there that
[792.48] is why Mom was taking me
somewhere far away.
[794.56] So where was your
mother taking you?
[796.36] You give me their address,
[797.56] I will drop you there.
[798.04] I don’t know,
[800.32] I don’t know whose house
mom was taking me to.
[887.56] Greetings brother.
[888.68] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[893.28] Come, my child,
[894.40] there is no need to hesitate,
feel at home.
[896.68] Greetings.
[898.48] Greetings.
[900.12] Tabassum? Tabassum?
[919.52] Yes, sir?
[920.16] Take madam to the guest room.
[922.64] Her stuff?
[923.96] Yes, this is it for now, keep her bag
[925.84] take the rest when it is here,
take her for now.
[928.16] Come.
[928.68] Go, my child, go.
[933.24] Brother, who is this girl?
[936.72] This girl and her mother
met an accident by my car.
[940.68] Yes, that’s okay but, she is here?
[951.92] I mean why did you
bring her here, brother?
[1011.76] Mom? Mom? Mom, save me,
[1025.92] mom, save mom, mom, stop.
[1031.28] Mom? Mom? Mom,
[1039.36] my mom.
[1044.96] Mom,
[1056.60] please get well soon, mom,
[1058.68] I don’t know where I am,
[1060.32] I really need you.
[1062.76] Mom, please get well,
[1065.64] please take care of me, mom,
[1068.08] I need you.
[1071.92] Mom.
[1076.04] Mom, come, mom. Mom.
[1098.80] Listen, girl?
[1099.92] Yes?
[1100.52] Put my phone on charge.
[1102.16] yes?
[1103.96] Didn’t you understand?
[1105.32] Put my phone on charge,
and the battery died.
[1109.00] Where is the charger?
[1110.84] How would I know?
[1111.80] Check it must be somewhere.
[1114.76] Okay.
[1116.08] Listen,
[1116.76] yes
[1117.32] put this on charge
[1118.80] and make a glass of
juice for me, okay?
[1121.28] What happened, my child?
[1122.28] Greetings,
[1123.44] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[1134.52] You have had a misunderstanding Alizeh,
[1136.68] she is our guest, she is a guest.
[1147.72] She is a guest?
[1155.32] yes.
[1162.40] umm, sorry uncle,
[1164.76] I thought we hired some new maid.
[1168.44] Sorry.
[1174.68] Is there any problem, my child?
Do you need something?
[1178.92] No, I mean,
[1182.04] I was out of water in my room,
so I came to get it.
[1184.76] You go to your room,
go I will send it.
[1187.64] Thank you.
[1202.44] uncle, who is this guest?
[1206.48] I will tell you.
[1256.68] Uncle was getting angry
at me for no reason.
[1259.92] Now that girl looked like a maid
by her appearance so I said it,
[1266.32] how would I know he will bring
someone from the hospital?
[1270.52] By the way, yes,
[1271.84] I was thinking the same that
[1274.04] if any girl would come up and say
[1275.92] I have no one except my mother so
[1278.44] how can you believe her?
[1280.56] Anyway,
[1281.60] I have instructed the servants
of the house as well
[1283.28] and I am telling you too.
[1284.24] Hmm?
[1285.32] Just keep your eyes open and
[1286.92] take care of your belongings.
[1289.88] What do you mean?
[1292.80] Look, brother has brought that girl
due to fear of God and sympathy
[1297.80] but these are the innocent faces that
rob the entire house,
[1302.00] they are not alone,
[1303.36] they have an entire gang involved.
[1306.08] What is wrong with you mom,
[1307.40] don’t scare me.
[1308.72] I am not scaring you,
[1309.76] I am telling you what is right.
[1311.68] But mom she looked innocent by face
[1314.44] and now what will the poor girl do?
[1316.12] Her mother is in coma.
[1320.92] I don’t know why do I feel that
[1323.12] I have met this girl somewhere
[1324.60] or I have seen her somewhere,
[1325.64] I can’t recall.
[1326.80] Oh, please mom,
[1328.36] don’t discover any relationship
with her now.
[1336.64] Oh God! Give that sister good
health and complete recovery,
[1342.40] oh Lord, ease her difficulties,
[1346.44] oh Lord, the doctors,
[1349.24] doctors are trying their
best to make her well,
[1352.48] give her speedy recovery my Lord.
[1357.20] Oh lord! Give cure in their hands,
[1361.00] oh Lord her daughter is so worried,
[1366.08] her daughter Ramsha is so worried.
Oh lord.
[1371.64] My Lord, the responsibility
I have taken,
[1379.44] I make you my witness and say that,
[1383.72] the way I take care of
Alizeh like my daughter,
[1391.84] Oh Lord, I am similarly, I am similarly
[1396.96] able to take care of Ramsha as well,
[1400.08] oh Lord, I have two sister and two
daughters from now onwards,
[1404.24] oh God! grant her good health,
[1408.56] grant her good health,
[1411.00] may Ramsha’s mother
always stay with her.
[1415.68] Oh Lord! Make everything well,
give health to all the patients,
[1418.28] oh Lord! Just give health
to all those who are ill.
[1421.56] *Arabic*
[1450.32] Greetings.
[1451.48] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[1456.52] How is your job, my child?
[1460.20] Uncle, it’s going great.
[1462.20] Thank God.
[1471.48] Tabassum,
[1472.84] call what is her name? Ramsha,
[1476.24] call her from the
guest room for food.
[1494.40] Brother, what is the
need to call her here?
[1499.40] We can send the food
in the guest room there.
[1502.96] It won’t look nice like this that
[1513.28] she eats alone there,
[1514.64] she should eat here with
the family here with us,
[1517.56] and she is already very
disturbed because of her mother.
[1535.84] Greetings.
[1537.04] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
Have a seat,
[1557.48] What will you eat?
[1558.56] There is Biryani, curry,
[1561.80] fried Rice, kebobs,
whatever you like.
[1571.56] Feel like home,
[1573.00] no formalities, eat, good girl.
[1621.80] Why did Alizeh leave?
[1623.20] She didn’t eat properly.
[1624.88] Brother, I guess she has
a lot of office work,
[1628.52] there is some project that
she needs to complete.
[1630.28] Okay,
[1632.20] have it my child, have the kebobs.
[1689.68] Thank you.
[1699.56] brother, have you sent
the driver somewhere?
[1702.60] Umm yes,
[1704.36] he has gone to the hospital with
Ramsha, he will come back in a while.
[1710.20] Brother, don’t you think that
[1714.08] this girl that you brought home,
[1716.80] you have taken a useless
responsibility on yourself.
[1727.68] I mean, brother
it would have been better
[1731.44] had you sent her to the girl’s hostel,
[1733.60] there are so many hostels in the city.
[1740.24] Yes, there are a lot
of hostels in this city but
[1743.32] I don’t trust the managements
of those hostels.
[1756.20] Do you remember Afsheen,
[1759.36] when you came to this house
after you got widowed,
[1763.00] at that time you wanted
to admit Alizeh to a hostel as well
[1773.24] but even at that time,
I was not convinced,
[1775.48] you remember right?
[1785.12] Look I don’t think that
[1788.08] there is any other place appropriate
for daughters when there is a home,
[1792.40] no matter if it is a hostel.
[1794.60] Brother,
[1796.08] there is a lot of difference
between Alizeh and that girl.
[1801.16] Alizeh is my daughter and
[1803.44] we know nothing about that girl that
[1805.32] which family does she belongs too,
[1806.76] what is her background and her nature.
[1811.56] I am surprised Afsheen,
[1816.16] you being a mother of a
daughter you are saying this?
[1828.24] No matter whose daughter is it,
[1831.44] we have to take care
of her the same way,
[1840.88] daughters are our own,
[1842.72] we are supposed to share their sorrows.
[1846.16] Brother I was just.
[1853.96] In the name of God, greetings.
[1877.36] Mom?
[1880.04] Mom?
[1881.96] Where are you taking my mom?
[1884.80] Where are you taking my mom?
[1887.48] Stop, mom? Mom? don’t go mom,
[1891.40] mom? Mom, don’t leave me, 
don’t take my mom.
[1896.60] Mom?
[1899.36] Mom!
[1902.72] They were taking mom somewhere.
[1904.40] Uncle? Uncle?
[1906.88] yes, yes, Mr. Noman, 
I even prayed for you and that
[1910.20] construction work of
 your plot will start too.
[1912.20] Mom? Mom?
[1913.92] Wait a minute,
 I will call you back.
[1915.16] Where is my mom?
 Where is my mom?
[1916.72] What? What? What happened,
 my child? What happened?
[1919.12] Go and stop them, 
ask them not to take mom,
[1921.64] if something happens to my mom.
[1922.80] What is going on here? 
Who is yelling?
[1924.12] I will die if something 
happens to my mom,
[1925.64] I won’t be able to tolerate
 if mom goes away,
[1927.68] tell them not to take my mom.
[1928.64] No, my child, who is taking her away?
[1930.00] No one is taking your mom away.
[1931.84] They are a lot of people,
[1933.16] they are taking my mom away,
[1934.48] I even stopped them,
[1935.68] they are not stopping,
[1936.76] they are saying no..
[1937.56] My child, your mom is at the hospital,
[1938.72] I have just come back from the hospital,
[1940.20] you must have had some nightmare,
[1942.08] Afsheen, go get water.
[1944.20] Come, come, sit, my child.
[1946.44] Uncle, you know 
I was stopping my mom,
[1949.24] I felt something has
 happened to my mom,
[1951.60] I won’t be able to live
 if something happens to my mom.
[1954.48] Bring my mom in front of me,
[1956.40] I just want to see her for once,
[1958.08] I want to see if she is okay or not.
[1960.16] Yes, you have water first. Have water.
[1963.08] I don’t want to drink water.
[1963.88] Have a little water, my child.
[1966.40] I won’t have water,
[1967.96] you just take me to the
 hospital once to show me my mother,
[1970.72] I will be fine when I see her.
[1972.72] I will take you to the
 hospital to your mom in the morning.
[1975.08] No, no, I want to go right now,
[1976.12] I want to see mom right now.
[1978.08] You must sleep now.
[1979.32] I feel so scared in the room,
[1981.20] I cannot sleep right now.
[1982.64] I want to see my mother please.
[1985.52] I will ask Tabassum to sleep with her,
[1988.44] you come upstairs.
[1989.52] Okay. Listen,
[1991.32] let’s do one thing, before sleeping,
[1993.64] recite 4 prayers and 
blow it in the air,
[1995.96] you won’t even be scared 
and you will be at peace.
[1999.64] My mom will be fine?
[2000.56] If God wills. If God wills.
[2001.92] I will drop you to your room.
 Come, come.
[2003.40] My mom.
[2004.00] Nothing will happen.
[2004.76] Nothing will happen to her,
 my love, come, come.
[2019.32] What are you doing?
[2021.16] I asked you to clean my room,
[2023.56] what have you gotten busy with?
[2024.84] Madam, sir asked me to
 clean this room for Madam Ramsha,
[2028.16] she will live in this 
room from now onwards.
[2030.12] What?
[2033.80] She will leave the guest 
house and live with us now?
[2036.92] What is wrong with brother?
[2038.64] I am just doing what sir 
has asked me to do.
[2041.68] Where is brother?
[2042.92] I will talk to him myself.
[2044.36] He has gone to the hospital 
with madam Ramsha.
[2046.84] Okay fine, you may go.
[2051.24] Oh God!
[2052.48] Brother has been visiting hospital like
[2055.12] our own family member is not well.
[2064.92] Ramsha, do you know,
[2067.84] May God grant her 
a house in heaven,
[2070.28] my mother’s name
 was Mehnaz as well.
[2072.56] What?
[2073.72] Your mother’s name 
was Mehnaz too?
[2076.04] Yes, she was a very pious,
[2079.04] kind-hearted and
[2080.64] a very mature woman.
[2139.08] I don’t understand what 
is uncle doing, after all?
[2142.76] He has brought a strange girl home
[2150.12] and now he is reacting 
as if she is our relative.
[2159.64] How can we trust an
 unknown girl like this?
[2163.08] You are right Alizeh,
[2165.08] let me talk to dad.
[2166.92] No Afnan, please you
 don’t say anything
[2173.04] else he will feel that
[2174.56] I and mom have complained 
about him to you.
[2177.32] No there will be nothing like that,
[2179.32] don’t worry, I will talk to him my way.
[2182.56] I am telling you that
[2183.88] you don’t need to
 say anything to him,
[2186.12] he will take it wrong.
[2187.32] okay fine, Alizeh, don’t worry.
[2196.36] Umm, my meeting is about to start,
[2198.28] I will talk to you later.
[2199.56] Okay, just relax bye.
[2202.72] Okay fine, take care.
[2209.76] Dad is…
