[22.08] I am satisfied,
[26.16] there is just a burden on my heart,
[43.08] I just want to ease the burden 
from my heart.
[48.92] Dad, tell me what are you 
trying to say?
[57.56] I will do as you say,
 I am saying it to you,
[60.20] I will do whatever you say.
[63.96] Afnan,
[67.04] I...
[70.52] I am handing over Ramsha to you,
[84.44] Have fear of God when it comes 
to that girl,
[103.04] If God forbid something 
happens to her,
[117.76] I will hold you responsible on the day
 of judgment.
[125.32] From now onwards I am going to do 
exactly what you are saying,
[128.72] you, nothing is happening to you, 
you are absolutely fine,
[131.68] you will see how you get absolutely well 
by God’s will, don’t say such things.
[135.56] Just take care of her.
[137.92] Yes, dad, I promise you, 
I will take care of Ramsha.
[144.72] Hmm, you have satisfied me.
[159.20] “I bear witness that there is 
no deity but Allah,
[169.24] and I bear witness that 
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.”
[180.88] Doctor?
[182.68] Doctor? Dad?
[184.72] Dad?
[186.40] Doctor?
[331.08] Uncle, see, I have picked up
flowers for you from the lawn outside.”
[354.52] Surely to God, we belong 
and to Him we will all return.”
[358.12] Oh God,
[360.68] I am content with your decision.
[464.64] What was the need for you to become 
the president of the mosque committee?
[468.20] You already have so many 
responsibilities and now this,
[471.72] you are just wasting your time 
for no reason.
[474.16] I am not wasting time but saving it,
[478.60] this time and these minor serving will be 
beneficial for me in the world hereafter,
[482.24] I just hope God accepts it.
[485.48] What is this? Why do you have 
tears in your eyes?
[487.28] No, no, it is not because of you.
[493.00] I know dad,
[495.28] I know you have been really hurt 
because of what we said
[497.88] but you have misunderstood 
what we said, dad.
[500.88] That is not what we meant,
[504.20] we were just trying to say that 
whatever you are doing is a lot.
[514.16] Okay. Afnan,
[516.92] do you know when we ask 
something from God
[521.84] we want him to give us the best 
and the most
[530.76] when it's time to spend in his way 
or for him we think less is more.
[544.32] You work day and night 
for worldly tasks,
[548.72] you don’t care if it is day or night,
[550.76] you just exhaust yourself and 
when God calls you, you get tired.
[556.16] Dad, now if I have to expand 
the business,
[560.32] I will have to work this hard. 
Hmm.
[563.28] You know a lot about worldly business,
you know it very well,
[567.88] try trading with God as well,
[571.08] it doesn’t just have benefits 
but salvation too.
[574.40] Afnan, do you know when we walk 
the path of God he gives us way more rewards,
[580.12] and do remember
[581.96] that there is no salvation 
in the way of success,
[584.52] but there is a bit of success 
in the way of salvation.
[594.32] We first tried to correct myself, 
and then
[600.76] tried to correct you as well.
[605.40] After your mother’s demise,
[611.32] I have fulfilled the responsibility of 
a Father with full sincerity and honesty.
[709.80] Afnan?
[722.24] So much, a person gets so helpless
[738.72] when in front of his own eyes,
[743.72] his own eyes, his own father…
[757.28] I wish, Ramsha,
[762.20] I wish that the time just rewinds once 
and I can go to my father.
[766.08] Have patience Afnan.
[774.12] Uncle has this much life written,
[788.92] he was a very special man of God
so God called him.
[803.68] Have patience,
[805.88] have patience.
[837.32] Brother Qasim was a very pious man,
[840.04] he was able to recite the Kalimah 
at the time of his demise,
[842.72] God gives this opportunity only 
to his fortunate men.
[852.28] He always used to help everyone,
[855.08] I have not seen a more kind-hearted 
man like him in this neighborhood.
[863.84] He never ever missed any 
of his prayers.
[870.68] I have informed about the demise 
of Mr Qasim in the mosque,
[873.76] May God give you patience.
[879.68] You guys just remember us 
in your prayers.
[897.12] My brother left me,
[900.60] my father like brother left,
[905.48] he left me.
[909.56] Despite of being a widow 
I have never felt so lonely,
[918.80] as much as I do after my brother left.
[928.36] My brother was my life,
[933.08] how will I live now?
[938.80] My brother left me.
[944.16] Mom, be strong.
[947.80] Mom?
[949.68] My brother left me.
[956.20] Control yourself. 
Have patience Mom.
[972.36] Why have you come here?
[990.32] You are here to see our hardships, 
our pain and problems.
[1003.80] So now watch,
[1005.48] watch and be happy.
[1012.24] Afsheen, who is she?
[1017.96] She is the one,
[1020.76] she is the cursed girl because of 
whom my brother left.
[1028.48] Because of you my brother had 
a heart attack today,
[1033.04] if you hadn’t run away 
from this house,
[1040.56] my brother would have left me today.
[1047.60] You cheap girl,
[1049.72] who used to live in small streets,
[1052.64] who doesn’t have any character,
[1056.12] my brother brought her to his house
and gave her respect,
[1060.56] he fulfilled all your wishes,
[1063.56] he made you equal to my daughter,
[1070.76] he took such good care of you but you,
[1074.32] you don’t deserve to be respected.
[1078.52] Get lost from this house.
[1081.92] You are insulting me.
[1090.00] Insult?
[1091.32] First, be worthy of the respect.
[1102.72] We all know what were you?
[1104.68] And not just us the whole world 
knows it.
[1106.92] I won’t tolerate you in my house
 even for a minute.
[1109.52] Get out of here.
[1110.84] Aunt, what are you doing?
[1112.52] What is wrong with you? 
Afnan, don’t interfere,
[1114.80] I won’t tolerate her even for 
a minute in this house.
[1117.92] Aunt, this is not the time to talk about
 all this, please don’t do this, please.
[1121.40] No Afnan,
[1123.04] because of him, my brother left me, 
I won’t leave her.
[1126.32] Aunt, Aunt please. 
Mom.
[1127.92] Everyone is watching, 
why are you putting up a show?
[1130.12] If it was for me I would have 
given her to the police.
[1133.84] It is my generosity that I am not saying
anything to her.
[1137.52] Afnan, how can you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this house?
[1142.12] Tell me. 
Get her out of this house.
[1144.08] Mom. 
Aunt, get back to your senses!
[1145.76] You are not providing peace 
to Dad’s soul by doing all this,
[1148.72] you are causing him pain instead.
 Please.
[1151.28] You, you go in your room. Go.
[1158.04] My brother left me.
[1172.04] Everything is over Alizey.
[1174.96] Mom, please, have patience. 
Everything is over.
[1265.92] Madam Ramsha,
[1267.72] have tea,
[1269.40] your headache will get better 
and you will feel light too.
[1274.16] I don’t feel like having anything,
[1276.76] take it away from here.
[1279.64] Did they bring uncle?
[1282.88] No, he has been kept in the Morgue.
[1286.76] Why in the Morgue?
[1288.64] actually, his cousin brother is coming 
from America
[1292.36] so he will get here tomorrow evening,
funeral will be done then.
[1295.76] And what if he doesn’t get here 
by tomorrow evening?
[1298.16] So then the funeral might happen 
day after tomorrow.
[1300.72] Day after tomorrow?
[1302.68] It means that they will keep Uncle
in the morgue till day after tomorrow?
[1308.16] Where is Afnan?
[1311.68] I will have to talk to Afnan.
[1313.72] Madam?
[1315.28] This is not possible,
[1316.80] they cannot cause so much pain 
to Uncle,
[1319.44] I will have to talk to Afnan.
[1321.12] Madam, you should leave the room,
[1323.76] Madam has created a huge scene
 because of you right now
[1327.08] and she will get angrier
[1328.88] and even Mr Afnan won’t listen 
to you and get angry.
[1332.52] I am asking you 
where is Afnan right now?
[1335.68] Some people are here to meet him,
he is in the drawing room.
[1338.24] Madam Ramsha, 
don’t go there.
[1340.32] I can’t let Uncle be in pain 
to save myself from pain.
[1344.64] He has done a lot of favors on me, 
let me do something for him as well.
[1349.28] Madam Ramsha?
[1351.88] Thank you so much for coming. 
Mr Muslim Scholar,
[1355.44] dad had a lot of love and 
respect towards you.
[1358.92] You came here and prayed for him,
[1361.80] his soul must have been in peace.
[1364.32] Indeed, Indeed. Son,
[1368.16] Mr Qasim was an extremely 
loving person.
[1378.40] Not just me he used to love everyone
[1387.80] and he had taken so much 
responsibility of the Mosque work.
[1393.80] May God grants him the reward of it.
[1398.04] Amen.
[1402.12] Afnan, I want to talk to you.
[1406.96] Mr Muslim Scholar, 
come, you come.
[1411.20] Mr Muslim Scholar, come.
[1414.84] Afnan,
[1416.40] why are you keeping Uncle
 in the Morgue?
[1429.28] That too, just because of a relative?
[1436.24] it is not your concern, 
don’t interfere in it.
[1439.36] I Know it is not my concern
[1447.68] but do you know
[1449.40] keeping a dead body in the Morgue
for two days,
[1453.16] just so a relative can fulfill the wish 
of seeing him for one last time
[1455.60] will cause so much pain to Uncle.
[1468.28] Why do you guys not understand this,
[1470.24] for the sake of your own relief 
you cause pain to someone else.
[1481.00] What kind of love is this?
[1487.12] When a person dies,
[1490.16] we should bury them 
as soon as possible.
[1502.64] So please try to understand 
what I am saying
[1506.00] and don’t keep Uncle in the Morgue,
[1516.80] it will cause him pain.
[1524.20] Afnan, son, this girl is absolutely right.
[1546.56] It is not okay to delay the funeral of 
Mr Qasim for any relative or anything.
[1568.88] Son, I suggest
[1572.44] you listen to what the girl is saying
[1589.16] and do the funeral soon,
[1602.88] that is better for the dead and 
we will get rewarded too.
[1618.36] Okay Mr Muslim Scholar.
[1629.48] You make an announcement 
in the Mosque
[1632.68] that the funeral prayers 
at the time of Asr today.
[1652.24] If God wills.
[1685.28] I won’t tolerate you in my house 
even for a minute.
[1687.92] Get out of here.
[1689.04] Aunt, what are you doing?
[1690.88] What is wrong with you? 
Afnan, don’t interfere,
[1693.16] I won’t tolerate her even for a minute 
in this house.
[1696.32] Aunt, this is not the time to talk about 
all this, please don’t do this, please.
[1699.60] No Afnan,
[1701.20] because of him, my brother left me,
I won’t leave her.
[1704.44] Aunt, Aunt please. 
Mom.
[1706.04] Everyone is watching, 
why are you putting up a show?
[1708.32] If it was for me I would have 
given her to the police.
[1712.08] It is my generosity that I am not saying 
anything to her.
[1715.64] Afnan, how can you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this house?
[1720.32] Tell me. Get her out of this house.
[1722.44] Mom. 
Aunt, get back to your senses!
[1724.04] You are not providing peace 
to Dad’s soul by doing all this,
[1726.88] you are causing him pain instead.
[1742.12] Mom, why aren’t you coming 
for breakfast?
[1747.60] Alizey,
[1752.36] I am thinking something.
[1762.56] Even after so much has happened,
[1766.12] why isn’t Afnan getting Ramsha 
out of this house?
[1770.24] Mom, leave all this,
[1777.72] everything will be done, 
come let’s have breakfast.
[1779.84] Alizey,
[1781.64] how can you say this with 
so much satisfaction?
[1786.96] because I have seen hatred and 
anger in Afnan’s eyes for Ramsha.
[1803.36] And you know that
[1805.28] when hatred and anger 
come together,
[1807.64] it makes the person’s brain 
to stop working,
[1820.60] you just wait and watch,
[1822.64] Afnan will get Ramsha out of 
this house himself in a few days.
[1839.88] Come, let’s have breakfast. 
Come.
[1869.32] Hey, come, come.
[1871.00] Greetings.
[1872.80] These are some clothes and 
the things you may need, yeah?
[1877.60] Hey Uncle, what was the need 
for all this?
[1880.20] You are worrying for me
for no reason.
[1882.20] What is there to worry about
[1885.36] and don’t call me Uncle,
[1887.32] call me Uncle like Alizey do,
[1891.52] I have made your mom my sister only.
[1896.76] Okay, I will try, Uncle. 
Hey, Uncle again?
[1905.84] Okay Uncle.
[1907.24] Stay blessed, stay blessed.
[1910.28] Check these things, 
you will like them.
[1917.04] My child, I admit it was my mistake. 
You haven’t made any mistake,
[1921.76] no matter you admit or not, 
I won’t get my mother back,
[1924.40] will you make up for my loss?
[1926.36] No, right? My loss won’t be made up
and mother won’t come back,
[1930.04] no right?
[1931.20] You have killed my mother,
[1935.60] You killed my mother, 
you are a murderer,
[1938.36] you are a murderer, 
you have murdered.
[1940.80] Just shut up.
[1942.76] How are you talking to my Dad?
[1944.12] I am abolsutely right, 
your father killed my mother.
[1954.40] Why are you looking like that, 
my child?
[1957.16] I am looking
[1960.36] that I misbehaved so much with you,
[1964.00] said you so many wrong things
[1966.64] and called you the murderer 
of my mother
[1971.08] and in return you,
[1973.64] you are treating me so politely,
[1980.72] you didn’t ask me to leave the house
[1982.80] but calling me to eat,
[1986.20] why?
[1991.36] Because I am afraid of God.
[2028.32] Uncle, soup.
[2029.96] Give it to me, I will feed him. 
Let it be, give it to me, I will have it myself.
[2034.32] Okay dad.
[2039.08] In The name of God the most 
gracious and merciful.
[2043.80] Hmmm,
[2046.84] wow the soup is amazing.
[2049.72] My child, now if I get ill again, 
make the same soup again.
[2056.76] Umm Uncle, God forbid you
 get ill again.
[2063.32] And you don’t have to get ill 
to have this soup,
[2066.52] I will make it for you 
whenever you ask me to.
[2068.40] Hey I will have to get ill to have 
this amazing soup.
[2073.00] Do you know
[2074.52] when the doctor came and 
stayed quiet for a long time,
[2077.48] we all got so scared,
[2080.24] Thank God, you are absolutely fine, 
Uncle.
[2083.76] Ramsha, my child,
[2085.68] God doesn’t burden a soul 
more than they can handle.
[2090.60] Look, I am perfectly fine 
in front of you,
[2093.04] why are you crying for no reason?
[2096.20] You are not well at all, 
look at your condition,
[2099.12] you are hyperventilating 
just by talking a little,
[2102.48] listen to me uncle,
[2104.12] you have to take good care 
of yourself now
[2106.84] and wait I will call the doctor.
[2109.40] No, you won’t go anywhere,
[2111.24] Afnan has gone to talk to the doctor, 
you come sit here.
[2128.32] I beg you don’t turn your back at me,
[2131.72] forgive me, trust me.
[2135.12] My child,
[2138.32] I trust you,
[2140.08] I trust you more than myself, Ramsha,
[2145.20] you didn’t lie to me,
[2152.12] Alizey and Afsheen will stoop so low, 
I could have never thought that,
[2159.00] they have been cruel to you, 
they are your culprits.
[2165.36] I called you my daughter
[2169.44] and I couldn’t even protect you.
[2192.40] Uncle,
[2195.56] forgive me.
