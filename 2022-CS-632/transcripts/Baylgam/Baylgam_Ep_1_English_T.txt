[103.88] Annie! Look at that.
[106.24] What a car, man? Oh.
Come on, let’s make a video.
[109.36] Come on. Come on.
Come on. Annie.
[111.12] Yes?
When everyone will watch this video….
[113.00] Yes?
They will go crazy.
[114.72] Everyone will feel this is my car.
[116.32] Make a video like this.
I will stand here.
[118.48] Take my phone.
Quickly take my phone.
[120.12] I will stand here and
you make a good video of me.
[122.12] Ready? Come on.
[123.52] But using someone’s car like this…
[125.00] Come on, quickly make the video.
Don’t think so much.
[126.88] Ready? I am coming from here. Wait.
Okay.
[146.28] Yes.
[147.52] We will go in your charity…
[163.28] This is my car.
[165.64] I think you were trying to open the door.
[169.96] I am sorry.
[188.00] Show me. Show me.
Show me. Quickly.
[194.52] Oh my God, such a pretty video.
[197.24] You will see,
[198.28] this video will have so many likes
and views that you cannot imagine.
[201.60] This video will surely get viral.
[204.24] You said the same about the last video.
[206.88] It only had 50 likes.
[208.24] It didn’t go viral.
[211.28] This one will surely get likes
[213.40] and this one will surely go viral.
Remember that.
[216.64] But,
[218.48] this mister seemed like a spoiled brat
of some rich man.
[222.24] If he has an objection,
[224.52] that we uploaded the video on Tik Tok
without his permission, then what will you do?
[229.44] I will find a solution for this.
[232.28] After all,
[233.80] I will not upload this video so easily.
[236.68] I will edit it, put a good song it,
[239.76] I will add some effects,
[241.80] then the video will be completely ready.
[244.08] Fine. Fine. The effects have been added.
[245.88] The filter has been applied. Now come,
attend it. Some song…
[249.04] Come on. Come on.
[322.24] See.
Yes?
[323.40] Your views are increasing further
compared to earlier.
[325.92] You know, I am getting messages.
[327.80] Everyone is saying that my new hairstyle,
and hair colour looks really good.
[331.84] Wow. Wow. Now see,
[333.80] if you follow this style, then gradually
your followers will increase.
[337.04] Oh man, I don’t want to increase
my followers gradually.
[339.76] I want that I become famous overnight,
[342.20] people know me,
I grow a lot of followers.
[343.92] I don’t know when this will happen, Annie.
[345.92] It will happen. It will happen gradually.
[350.52] I hope so. The function is so good…
[353.36] look at that. Look at that. Look at that.
[355.68] Man, Annie, I want that
I become just like her.
[368.32] You will be.
[369.36] You will be more than her.
[370.80] Ramsha, just keep on working hard.
[372.40] But Annie, she has a lot of followers.
[375.00] I want that even I become this famous
overnight,
[377.60] I too have so many followers.
Everyone goes around me like this.
[380.64] I don’t know when this happen.
[382.16] She gets a million views on every video.
[386.72] It will happen. I told you to work hard.
[388.96] Okay.
[412.00] May I come in sir?
[413.56] Come in.
[419.72] Good morning sir.
[430.00] Please send Miss Anum to my room.
[432.92] Thank you.
[448.80] May I come in, sir?
[451.00] Yes, come.
[454.28] Yes, sir?
[455.44] Miss Anum, I had given you
a file two days back.
[458.12] Sir, actually I was on leaves for the past
two days, even today…
[461.48] You do one thing, take permanent leave.
[465.20] What?
Yes.
[467.64] I don’t want such employees in my office,
that take offs every second day.
[471.44] This is really irresponsible behavior.
[473.68] You please leave.
[475.00] But sir, I had informed sir Qasim,
my father was hospitalized.
[479.16] Look miss Anum,
that is your personal matter
[482.04] and this is a professional environment.
[484.16] I don’t it to get ruined
because of one employee.
[487.56] When I had told you I need the file
in two days,
[490.08] then it was your responsibility that
you should have delivered it to me.
[493.16] Because of you my contract got delayed.
[495.84] You please leave from here.
[498.24] And yes,
[500.28] don’t go to dad…
[502.12] I mean Mr. Qasim.
[505.00] Stop manipulating him.
[507.64] This is my final decision.
[509.64] You may leave.
[523.36] Yes?
[525.28] Fine.
[526.72] Make him sit in the conference room.
I am coming. Thank you.
[536.00] You don’t worry,
everything will be fine.
[538.44] Greetings.
Greetings sir.
[541.04] Hey, why are you people standing here?
Go and do your work. Go child.
[545.16] Greetings.
[546.40] Greetings. Anum, what happened?
[549.28] Hey,
[550.72] why are you crying, child?
[552.56] Anum, what happened?
Tell me child.
[555.12] Sir Afnan fired me from the job.
[559.56] But why?
[600.00] Where are you lost?
[602.92] Nowhere.
[604.80] I am searching for that hero.
[607.04] Maybe I will get his Facebook account
by chance.
[609.32] Whose?
[611.00] Hey the same with whose car
I made a Tik Tok in university.
[616.60] His?
Yes.
[618.92] Maybe I can help you find his account.
[623.52] You?
[625.12] How can you help me?
[626.96] I can, I am not that useless.
[629.32] No. No. I mean how can you help me?
[632.28] Do you know him?
[633.80] Obviously not,
[635.52] but his car was in the university,
[637.48] so he must have someone
in the university.
[641.12] You are right.
[642.68] Why did I not think of that?
[644.20] If he came to the university
[646.36] then he would also have someone
he knows there.
[648.84] This means we will go to the university
tomorrow and find out about him.
[652.76] Done.
Done.
[654.52] By the way,
[655.88] if you find his ID,
will you say sorry?
[658.36] Huh, sorry for what?
[660.92] You were making a Tik Tok
with his car, that’s why.
[664.44] Have you gone mad?
[666.08] Who says sorry on something so small?
[669.64] Then why are you searching for the ID?
[672.48] I don’t know.
[674.16] I just wanted to see him one more time.
[678.76] Oh, okay.
[682.96] What is wrong?
[684.52] Did you see my Tik Tok from yesterday?
[687.48] Come, I will show you.
[688.76] I made a Tik Tok yesterday,
check out how pretty I look.
[691.40] See how many likes I got.
[693.28] Your outfit looks so pretty.
Right?
[695.52] Yes…
You know…
[706.76] May I come in sir?
Yes, come in. Come in.
[711.08] Sir, I had to get your signature
on these.
[714.00] What is it?
[718.32] Okay, give it.
[722.00] This.
[724.36] Over here? At the bottom?
Sir, here.
[726.72] Fine.
[728.52] If you want any other signatures,
[731.20] get it done by Mr. Afnan, okay?
[733.04] Okay.
Thank you.
[738.64] May I come in, dad.
Hey, come in. come in.
[742.60] What happened? You got late.
Where were you?
[745.48] I went to the hospital.
[749.36] Are you fine?
[750.52] Yes. Yes, I am fine.
[753.00] That girl who works in our office, Anum.
[757.04] Yes?
[757.84] Her father’s condition is not fine,
[761.80] so I had told her that you spend
your most time with your papa.
[765.56] So, if they need anything, Afnan,
then don’t say no to them.
[769.20] Hmmm….
[771.04] dad….
[773.04] I was about to share this with you.
[775.52] Actually, now Anum will spend time
with her father.
[779.64] Because now she will not work in this office.
I have fired her.
[783.24] What? Why?
But I saw her in the office.
[786.68] She was working outside.
[790.36] Really?
[792.32] So, this means that she has already
complained to you about me.
[797.44] Hey, what is wrong?
Why would she complain?
[800.28] She was crying. I saw her,
[803.40] so what would that poor thing
complain about?
[806.16] Afnan, do you know the best action
of a person is that of empathy.
[815.20] Dad, why don’t you understand me?
[819.24] I know.
[820.40] I know, you have a lot of pain in
your heart for your employees.
[824.28] But all of them together take advantage
of your leniency, they deceive you.
[828.56] Child, I don’t have to account
for what they do.
[833.52] I have to account for what I do.
[837.00] Anyway, let your anger go.
[838.52] You know, someone is a little
angrier than you.
[842.76] More than me?
Yes.
[844.28] Who?
[846.36] The one you had to drop and
you are nowhere to be found.
[852.08] Alizay.
[855.32] Oh God, Alizay had…
Yes.
[857.84] Careful. Listen to me.
[859.60] How can I forget dad that today was
her flight, and her time….
[862.56] You shouldn’t forget either. Now
don’t tell her that you had forgotten,
[866.12] tell her I was waiting for papa,
he came to the office and I came.
[870.60] Fine, dad. Whatever I remember
out of this in front of her, I will say it.
[874.32] If she agrees, then.
[875.84] But I have to leave now, can I go?
Yes, go, go.
[878.24] Okay, thanks dad.
I love you.
[881.60] Live long.
Pray for me.
[883.12] Your prayers are answered.
Pray that I survive. Okay bye.
[886.20] Best of luck.
[905.40] Mama, I am not going for the first time.
[908.00] Why are you worried?
I have gone earlier as well.
[911.40] Hey, when you step out of the home,
I become restless.
[915.72] You are going to Islamabad right now.
[917.48] So, when is Islamabad so far?
It is just a two-hour flight.
[921.68] And see, as soon as my work ends,
I will come back.
[926.56] Mama, you fix your mood.
[930.40] Hey, aunt what is wrong?
[931.88] Why are you explaining to her for
no reason and getting worried?
[937.12] You don’t know,
[938.52] once she decides something,
she does that.
[941.28] Okay tell me,
is your packing done?
[943.16] Yes, all my packing is done.
[945.96] Good.
[946.88] Okay, you people chat,
I will get something to eat.
[949.00] Hey, no, dont get anything for me.
[950.72] Okay sit.
[953.68] By the way, why?
[955.24] Why should she not get
something for you?
[957.24] You lost your appetite hearing
about me leaving?
[960.48] Are you mad?
[962.40] Don’t be so mistaken.
[964.96] When you leave,
there will be peace at home.
[982.08] Why don’t you say all that
which is in your heart,
[986.20] or is it just my imagination
that you like me?
[995.24] What happened?
[996.32] Why are you looking at me like that?
[999.04] No. Nothing.
[1019.04] Ramsha.
[1020.24] Annie, it is good that you came.
I have edited the video.
[1022.72] Check it. Tell me how is it?
Look at this.
[1024.76] I have an even better news than this.
[1027.20] What?
[1028.16] I have found the ID of that hero.
[1029.80] What? The one with the car?
[1031.60] Yes, him.
[1032.88] Tell me. Quickly tell me.
[1034.40] Turn on your Facebook.
[1035.48] We will search on my Facebook,
tell me quickly.
[1037.32] Write Afnan.
[1038.80] Afnan?
Yes.
[1040.72] Wow, the name is good.
Okay, which one?
[1044.28] Go to the options,
scroll down.
[1045.72] This. This. Look.
There he is.
[1048.84] Oh, what a picture.
[1052.40] Awesome. Wait,
I will message him.
[1054.60] But no, I will not message him right now,
I will message him later.
[1057.64] But scroll.
[1062.28] Oh wow.
I found him, right?
[1064.12] This is the same car
we took a picture with.
[1097.44] Did you drop her?
[1098.84] Yes.
[1100.12] Was she worried?
[1101.56] Hey, no, what is there to worry about?
[1104.28] She is a very strong girl.
You still treat her like a small girl.
[1107.92] For me she is like a small girl till today.
[1111.44] You know, I stay so worried for her.
[1114.52] Don’t worry about her.
[1116.32] She will take good care of her.
[1118.52] Come on, don’t worry,
get me some good coffee, please.
[1120.84] Okay fine.
[1128.36] Your presence has really increased
the beauty of this video.
[1131.64] If you allow me,
then can I upload this video?
[1134.88] Is the message gone?
[1136.76] Please reply. Reply. Reply.
[1139.84] Yes, yes, I will call you back.
[1141.60] Okay. Okay bye.
[1143.60] Aunt, is the coffee ready?
[1145.68] Yes, the coffee is ready.
I am bringing it.
[1160.64] Your presence has really increased
the beauty of this video.
[1164.48] If you allow me, then
can I upload this video?
[1171.64] Yes, if you want to upload it,
then go ahead.
[1174.20] I have no objections.
Thank you.
[1183.96] Aunt, I am waiting.
[1187.60] His reply is here.
[1190.20] Yes, if you want to upload it,
then go ahead.
[1192.92] I have no objections.
[1194.00] Oh my God, what a voice this man has.
[1198.92] Ramsha.
[1201.20] Yes?
[1202.28] Hey, are you going somewhere?
[1205.32] No, why? What happened?
[1207.48] So why are you so dressed up?
[1209.00] Mama, I got ready to make a TIk Tok.
[1212.56] Ramsha.
[1215.36] Papa.
[1216.24] I think he got my ring light.
[1218.72] My ring light.
Careful.
[1220.48] Yes, papa. I am coming.
I am coming.
[1223.72] His father has made her go mad.
[1228.68] Ramsha.
[1230.44] Yes, papa, I am here.
[1234.16] Here your light.
[1235.60] You got it? You are so good,
thank you.
[1238.64] How is it possible that my daughter
makes a wish and I don’t fulfill it
[1241.84] Thank you papa.
What was the need to bring it?
[1244.84] You fulfill every wish of hers.
[1247.04] This love and affection of yours
has spoiled her.
[1250.72] We have one daughter, wife of mine,
[1253.12] if we don’t care for her,
then should we care for the neighbours?
[1257.76] Serve food, I am going
to wash my hands and face.
[1259.20] Yes. Yes.
[1260.96] Hey wow, now I will make such a Tik Tok,
mama, that you will keep on looking.
[1266.16] Ramsha.
[1268.80] Ramsha,
[1270.12] I had told you to check on the milk,
I had kept it for boiling.
[1276.36] I am so sorry, aunt.
[1277.80] I completely forgot. It slipped my mind.
I am so sorry.
[1281.08] Obviously, if you get your attention
out of the mobile,
[1284.20] then you will focus on something else.
[1286.48] Sister in law, your daughter doesn’t
pay attention to anything.
[1289.84] Hey, Salma, what is wrong?
[1292.24] She always has her mobile in her hand,
[1294.20] she is only focusing on videos.
[1295.80] Obviously, why will she do any work?
[1297.12] I had asked her to check on the milk
in the kitchen.
[1299.84] My daughter Annie is also there,
[1301.68] whatever work I give her she does it
with so much responsibility.
[1304.44] But she?
[1305.40] She doesn’t pay attention to anything.
[1307.12] I had cleaned the stove in the morning.
[1309.08] Come to the kitchen and
have a look at the stove.
[1312.92] The milk has burned and stuck on to it.
[1316.40] Hey, Salma, don’t worry.
I will clean the stove.
[1321.44] Sister, it is not about cleaning the stove.
[1324.12] Even I can do that,
[1326.12] but it is not good for girls to always have
mobiles in their hands and make videos.
[1333.60] Annie.
[1335.48] Annie, child, come to the kitchen
with me.
[1351.08] I am tired of making Tik Toks today.
[1355.12] By the way,
[1356.76] let me check how many likes
and views I got.
[1364.72] Wow,
[1366.76] the likes and views of this video is
more than my other videos.
[1375.28] But still,
[1377.04] compared to other people the likes
and views on my video a really less.
[1406.88] He is not replying.
[1420.68] It is here.
[1427.76] I am Ramsha from Nazimabad….
[1435.80] no, no, Nazimabad sounds weird.
[1439.36] Clifton.
[1460.84] Block?
[1463.80] What will be the block?
[1467.04] Five.
[1468.96] Block five.
[1491.88] I am a student
[1498.04] and you?
[1518.32] Hey, the reply is here.
[1527.96] Oh,
[1529.88] you know he seemed like a
businessman.
[1532.68] The dressing was amazing too.
[1535.72] I will talk to him more.
[1549.32] Here you go.
[1551.16] You know,
[1552.36] I spoke to him on call
for one whole hour,
[1555.08] and in all this hour I found him
to be so decent and sober,
[1558.72] and he is really handsome as well
[1560.56] and he is rich too.
[1562.24] You know I checked his entire profile,
[1565.00] I checked every single picture of his well.
[1567.48] Ramsha, these profiles are often fake
and this is happening a lot nowadays.
[1571.32] Listen,
[1572.48] I have been using social media 
for a lot of years
[1575.08] and I know well.
[1576.68] which is a fake profile and which is real.
[1578.92] So, you don’t tell me this.
[1580.44] Don’t you know?
[1581.68] I was the one who had caught 
Shazia’s boyfriend.
[1583.40] How was he fooling you all through 
a fake profile?
[1586.24] Yes, you are right about that.
[1588.52] Anyway, leave it. Tell me, 
what did you talk about?
[1592.72] Nothing. Just hello, hi.
[1595.96] For one hour you did hi and hello?
[1598.92] If you don’t want to tell me, then don’t, 
but don’t lie to me.
[1602.88] We didn’t talk about much. Come, 
I will tell you what we spoke about.
[1605.96] I swear Alizay,
[1607.40] I cannot tell you when you are not here 
there is so much peace and comfort in this home.
[1612.28] Okay, so me not being there has 
brought peace to the home.
[1616.64] Absolutely.
[1617.64] You are not here, so there is peace.
[1620.48] You know, if you were here then
you wouldn’t have been able to feel it.
[1622.92] So, I called to thank you.
[1626.72] Okay, then just saying thanks won’t work.
[1630.68] Send me a bouquet,
[1633.36] some gifts, some chocolates,
[1636.52] because the peace that is there 
because of me not being there,
[1639.92] that will be there for almost 
one more week.
[1644.72] What do you mean?
[1646.20] You will stay there for another week?
[1648.12] Yes, man, I am helpless, 
what can I do?
[1650.68] You know, the project is 
nearing the end.
[1653.36] So, I will have to stay for some more time, 
like a week.
[1656.64] Yes, but one more day works,
[1660.36] but the whole week? No, no,
[1662.52] you shouldn’t work with such people.
[1665.16] Huh? What do you mean?
[1667.32] What do you mean I shouldn’t work?
[1669.44] Meaning, such useless people.
[1671.56] Hey, the ones who don’t know how long 
it will take their work to be complete,
[1674.52] how can you work with them?
[1677.48] They already knew Afnan,
[1679.72] I was the one who was thinking that 
the work would be done in two days
[1682.08] and I would come back
[1683.52] or else the schedule was the everyone
will stay here.
[1686.76] But now I am thinking 
I will stay here.
[1689.60] No, no, no need for you to stay there.
[1692.00] You just come back.
[1693.16] Hey, but Afnan.
Hey, no buts.
[1694.88] You are coming, so you are coming.
[1696.80] Okay fine, I will come back.
[1699.52] But what about the peace of your home?
[1703.12] It won’t remain.
[1704.80] Hey it may not remain, but…
[1706.80] Okay fine, I will come.
[1710.28] Fine. Take care of yourself, 
I will talk to you later.
[1713.72] Okay bye.
[1715.84] Bye.
[1741.68] see, I had told you yesterday as well, 
I cannot talk to anyone like this.
[1745.20] This could be a fake account.
[1747.20] If you want to talk to me,
then do it on a video call.
[1752.60] Look, this cannot be a girl’s voice.
[1755.84] And why would my voice be fake?
[1757.68] A person should be this smart.
[1762.04] Nowadays the times have
become really advance,
[1764.44] this could also be a software too,
[1766.32] through which you are making 
a girl’s voice.
[1768.52] I have told you, 
you talk to me face to face
[1772.96] or else I cannot talk to you.
[1776.44] Mister aren’t you showing
too many tantrums.
[1779.48] Anyway,
[1781.68] fine, if you don’t want to believe me, 
then don’t.
[1785.16] it doesn’t matter to me. 
It is up to you.
[1789.88] Fine, as you see fit.
[1791.96] I was just saying that 
if you are talking,
[1794.72] then come in front.
[1796.48] And the second option is stop talking. 
Simple.
[1801.60] So many tantrums?
[1803.56] It feels like it is some girl, 
who is throwing a lot of tantrums.
[1819.60] You are still on the phone?
[1821.36] Ramsha, you don’t care about me at all.
Whether I live or die, why would you care.
[1825.32] Why?
[1827.00] What happened to you?
[1828.12] And why are you talking like aunt?
[1830.92] I am so worried, 
you are still on your phone.
[1834.80] Annie, if you tell me then I will know, 
speak up.
[1839.16] The wedding planner had talked 
to mama about a proposal.
[1843.20] They are coming today.
[1845.20] Oh,
[1847.24] so what is the need to worry in this?
[1849.68] You should get used to all this.
[1852.40] After all, this is not the first time 
a proposal is coming for you.
[1854.72] You should get used to all this now.
[1857.44] Don’t get too over.
[1860.00] Come and help me. Come tell me 
what I should wear.
[1862.60] Come on.
[1863.68] Hey, I am not going anywhere, 
I have a lot of work.
[1865.68] Ramsha, get up. 
Come on, help me.
[1868.48] Tell me what I should wear. 
Please. Please come.
[1871.64] Wait, I will come.
[1874.68] Pick out a dress yourself, 
you should know.
[1876.60] Your dressing sense is much better.
[1893.20] Aunt,
[1895.16] what happened? 
What are you doing?
[1897.92] Why? Can I not do all this?
[1900.48] Since the gardener went on leaves,
[1902.80] I thought I would practice.
[1905.40] Okay fine, you are done with your practice.
[1907.72] I don’t like you doing all this work.
[1909.64] After all, I am not doing anything,
I am getting bored. I will do it
[1912.80] The one because of whom 
you are getting bored, talk to them.
[1916.04] I just spoke to her and came…
[1921.04] Aunt, you are really sharp.
[1923.92] When did I say that 
I am bored because of her.
[1926.52] In fact, she is not home, 
there a lot of peace.
[1929.92] There is so much silence in my heart, 
my home, I am really enjoying it.
[1935.24] You know,
[1937.44] after sister-in-law left,
[1940.04] you were four years old, 
when you came in my arms.
[1943.72] Who would know you better than me?
[1946.68] I know everything when you want what,
and what do you want.
[1954.00] You know there is something,
[1958.28] no matter how much I thank God, 
it is less
[1961.00] that he gave me an aunt like you.
[1963.52] After mama passed away,
[1966.28] you didn’t let me feel for a moment
[1969.80] that she is not in this world.
[1972.44] You gave me the same amount of love 
and care for me,
[1975.32] that if she was alive, 
she would have given me.
[1978.16] And you know what the best thing is?
[1980.12] You care for everyone,
[1983.04] but you never let anyone feel it.
[1985.72] Now you look at brother,
[1988.60] he has never let Alizay feel that 
her father is not there.
[1994.40] Us elders live for the children.
[2000.12] Okay tell me, why did you not go
to the office?
[2001.92] Are you okay?
[2003.16] Yes, I am fine,
[2005.36] but I didn’t feel like it. So, I told dad 
that I am not coming today.
[2008.68] But now I feel I made 
the wrong decision.
[2011.36] I am really bored.
[2013.12] But I am not bored because of her. 
Okay?
[2016.68] You come on, 
I will make good coffee for you.
[2019.04] Come on.
Come on. Come on.
[2020.52] and you shouldn’t do this work 
of the gardener, you know.
[2036.88] Oh hello, what are you doing?
[2039.44] Will you put on the maroon lip colour?
[2040.96] You will look like an aunty. 
Put on the pink one.
[2043.16] This suits me.
[2044.36] This suits me. Fine, 
wear it. Wear it.
[2046.60] Become an aunt. 
I am leaving, go to hell.
[2048.12] Okay, okay, Ramsha. 
Don’t get upset.
[2049.48] I will wear the pink one. 
Should I put on this one?
[2050.76] Yes.
[2054.72] Wow, see,
[2056.32] you look so good. 
Listen to me.
[2061.88] Great.
[2065.00] Fix my scarf too.
[2067.24] I will fix your scarf, 
first put on the blush well.
[2071.04] You know, if I was not there what would 
have happened to you Annie?
[2075.04] You had taken out such bad clothes 
to wear, out of fashion.
[2078.72] And see how you have 
styled your hair,
[2081.20] and you were putting 
on maroon lip colour?
[2083.00] You would have looked like an aunty,
in fact, you would have looked like a mother.
[2085.52] Now I understand.
[2086.92] That is why so many proposals 
of yours got rejected,
[2088.84] because you make this weird dressing 
and go in front of them.
[2092.12] Idiot.
[2093.96] Come on, quickly fix your makeup.
[2095.60] Hey, what is wrong?
[2097.48] Stop laughing, for God’s sake.
[2099.04] The boy’s family is here, 
be quick. Come on.
[2101.04] Okay, okay, you go, 
we will come in two minutes.
[2102.44] Let me fix her hair.
[2103.88] It has been so long.
[2105.12] And listen don’t take more than 
five minutes, understand?
[2107.20] Be quick now. 
Mama, we are coming. We are coming.
[2109.40] Let your hair fall in front a little, 
don’t do too much. Okay? Come on.
[2112.64] Hey, hey, where are you coming?
[2115.24] No,
[2117.16] the boy’s family has come
[2118.44] and you should make the boy’s family wait,
it is a good thing.
[2121.36] I will go and see how good looking 
the boy is, okay?
[2125.12] And till I don’t come, stay here. 
Understand?
[2128.12] Have you gone mad? 
I cannot come like this.
[2130.88] I will go with you,
you come to get me.
[2132.96] Good.
[2137.16] Yes, my son is really capable.
[2140.52] He has become a doctor. 
He is in the hospital in the morning
[2143.68] and the evening he does his clinic.
[2145.56] Are you Annie’s father?
[2149.12] No, no, I am Annie’s uncle
[2151.56] and this is her aunt.
Mehnaz, my wife.
[2154.00] This is my younger brother, 
Anwar and his wife, Salma,
[2156.88] they are her parents.
[2159.64] Yes, all of us live together.
[2162.40] On the face of it, Annie is Anwar 
and Salma’s daughter,
[2166.44] but believe me she is as dear to us 
like our Ramsha.
[2170.68] Sister-in-law is right.
[2173.60] Actually, we don’t find any difference 
in our children.
[2179.76] Call the daughter. 
Salma, call Annie.
[2187.88] This…this is Ramsha, 
my daughter.
[2191.12] Ramsha, greet them.
[2193.20] Greetings.
[2195.04] Gretings. 
Live long child.
[2197.80] Ramsha child, 
why did you not bring Annie?
[2200.40] Go call her, bring her.
[2204.08] Yes, yes, I will bring her.
[2209.12] You have something. 
Sure.
[2213.80] Annie.
[2215.40] Annie. Annie, my sister,
[2217.64] sister, your ship has sunk.
[2219.68] What happened?
[2220.48] Annie, you are ruined, 
did you find out?
[2224.12] What happened Ramsha, 
tell me quickly, please.
[2226.96] Don’t ask me what I saw downstairs 
and came.
[2230.32] Don’t ask. Don’t ask.
[2232.04] What did you see, Ramsha?
[2233.68] You know those people have come 
downstairs with your proposal.
[2236.80] I know this, quickly tell me the rest.
[2239.52] The boy who has come along,
[2241.88] he is bald. 
He has no hair on his head.
[2245.64] Ramsha, I know.
[2249.44] Are you serious?
[2251.32] You know that boy is bald,
[2253.24] still you agreed to marry him? 
Have you gone mad?
[2257.92] So? Mama has told me that the proposal 
is good, the boy is a doctor.
[2261.20] So, what if he is a doctor, 
he is also bald.
[2264.40] You know he looks like a uncle.
[2267.24] No, no, mama was telling me he is thirty,
thirty-two years old.
[2270.64] Don’t worry, I know all this.
[2273.84] You know it all? Still you agree 
to get married?
[2278.36] Have you gone mad? 
Will you marry a bald man?
[2282.64] You think yourself if after marriage 
you go out with him,
[2286.48] then he won’t look like your husband,
he will look like your father-in-law.
[2290.04] What justifications will you 
give to everyone?
[2293.08] And all your friends,
[2294.72] they will make so much fun of you,
they will laugh at you.
[2298.68] What all will you say to everyone, Annie,
[2301.40] and tell me something, do you remember 
that Arfa incident.
[2305.24] Everyone made so much fun 
of that poor thing,
[2307.80] she used to cry so much.
[2309.60] How will you face everyone Annie?
[2313.80] What do I do right now, Ramsha?
[2316.76] There is just one solution.
[2319.16] Get up.
[2340.68] Don’t bring more for me.
[2343.96] I am full. 
Okay.
[2346.08] I was just going to stop, but you 
brought it so I will eat it.
[2350.00] What has happened
[2352.12] that both you father and son 
have lost their appetite.
[2354.88] My appetite is lost cause of happiness.
[2358.96] Such a good proposal came 
for our daughter.
[2363.40] I am not hungry in my happiness.
[2365.32] Now I pray to God that we get a 
good response from there.
[2369.84] We will get a yes from them.
[2371.72] I found out from their behavior 
that they will say yes,
[2374.64] or else they wouldn’t have prayed 
so much for Annie when they left.
[2380.68] after all, our Annie is no less 
than anyone.
[2384.56] See. She is simple, she was not 
wearing any makeup.
[2390.24] Yes.
[2392.08] I didn’t think about this.
[2395.20] When Annie and Ramsha both came 
to the room,
[2398.80] I thought Annie is wearing makeup.
[2401.56] Hey, tell her. She would have 
put on a little.
[2405.32] She would have done it in a way 
that simplicity would remain
[2408.20] and the makeup would be done too.
[2409.96] Girls today are really smart.
[2413.00] They are not like you. 
Yes, that is true.
[2416.84] May God just give her a good fate.
[2418.68] Amen.
[2420.56] By the way, where is she? 
Does she not want to have food?
[2423.28] She had food, 
she is studying in her room.
[2426.32] She is really smart.
[2427.76] As soon as she found out 
she is going to a doctor’s home,
[2430.36] she started paying attention 
to her studies.
[2432.16] He is always after her.
[2434.68] Give me a bite, 
I feel this kebab is for me.
[2439.00] I will bring more, 
it will take a minute.
[2441.44] No, no, I won’t have more. 
After all, my tummy is out.
[2449.28] Okay.
[2451.60] Kehwa. 
I am giving it.
[2456.40] Huh?
[2457.56] So soon? No, no, not so soon.
[2460.80] You please wait for some time.
[2465.60] Yes…
[2469.36] What happened?
[2473.00] Who are you talking to so late at night?
[2477.84] Whoever I talk to, 
why do you care?
[2481.60] Mind your own business, understand?
[2485.32] After all, my friend on the phone.
[2488.68] Do you want to talk to her?
[2489.76] Should I make you talk to her?
Here, talk to her.
[2493.20] I am not interested.
[2495.32] But tell your friends not to call you 
at this hour.
[2499.40] Hello mister,
[2501.12] don’t try to act like my father.
[2504.20] She is my friend,
[2505.80] she will call me when she wants, 
and I will answer the call when I want.
[2510.72] Show this attitude to your sister,
not me.
