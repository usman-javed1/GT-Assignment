[16.92] I am just going to have food
and get to the shop then,
[19.44] do one thing hand over
the grocery list to brother,
[22.68] he will get it out for you.
[24.04] Yes, yes, I will just be there,
I will be there.
[26.08] We will meet then. Bye.
[31.68] I don’t see Annie around.
Where is she?
[38.04] She has gone to her friend’s
house with Ramsha
[40.40] for combined study.
[45.64] How many times have
I told you not to send her with Ramsha?
[50.00] Can't you hear me?
[52.36] What is wrong with you Anwar?
[55.28] She is your niece,
[57.00] you have a bond with her,
[59.40] I know she has made a mistake.
[62.68] I have no relationship with her,
[65.60] she is nothing to me.
[68.88] Brother Sajid can get blind and
deaf for the love her daughter,
[73.56] I cannot.
[76.48] No Anwar,
[79.04] sometimes, in order to fulfill
some relationships,
[82.32] despite listening and seeing
a lot of things,
[84.84] we have to act blind and deaf.
[86.64] Enough, enough,
[89.40] had it been me instead of brother Sajid,
[93.36] I would have killed my child by now.
[98.72] No,
[101.08] no matter what our child does,
[103.28] we can never stop loving our children,
[107.24] I have realized it very well.
[109.92] What to do about such a child
[112.96] that cannot keep their parents' honor safe.
[117.28] Give me food.
[119.24] Love of children.
[133.24] What happened?
[134.48] My friend Hania?
[136.32] Yes.
[136.80] Her boyfriend shot in front
of me by a gun,
[139.44] and she died then and there,
you know what?
[141.20] Okay fine..
[141.60] The police think it’s my fault.
[143.40] They kept me in the prison.
[143.96] quiet, quiet.
[146.12] Be quiet.
[151.32] I am here now,
[153.44] everything will be fine now.
[155.88] What kind of a girl are you?
[161.20] Ramsha,
[163.64] how wouldn’t I come?
[166.40] It was you,
[168.36] I had to come for you at any cost.
[172.20] And I know it very well that
you haven’t done anything,
[175.40] you are being framed in the matter,
[178.36] but I am with you Ramsha,
[181.60] I will not leave your back in
these difficult times.
[225.04] Yeah?
[226.72] I am so sorry, I am so sorry,
[229.08] I know that I got late today
as well as usual,
[231.60] but you know what?
My planning was amazing today,
[233.68] I was leaving the office right in time
[235.80] but then suddenly
I had to attend a meeting,
[237.32] now you know that
[238.48] I cannot just leave the employees.
[240.64] I had to attend the meeting because
the interaction needed to be maintained,
[243.88] an important client was coming,
[245.40] anyways,
[246.16] tell me did you eat something?
[247.52] Shall I order something?
[249.04] But tell me
[250.40] what is the matter that you called me
here so urgently to talk about?
[254.00] Tell me now?
[256.44] What? What happened?
[259.92] Hello?
[261.96] Where are you lost?
[263.76] You talk so much usually that
I get fed up
[267.88] and today when you had to talk
about something important
[269.20] you are not saying anything,
[270.36] tell me what was it?
[272.88] Actually Afnan,
[275.76] I want to talk about something
important but
[277.16] I don’t know how to start.
[283.60] I can’t believe this,
[285.56] you are saying that?
[289.80] You are saying this
who doesn’t get tired of talking
[292.40] and she doesn’t know how to talk today?
[296.12] What happened to you?
[297.40] Are you feeling okay?
[299.12] Do you have a fever?
[300.40] Come let me take you to the doctor.
[304.44] Afnan,
[307.16] actually my family is l
ooking to get me married,
[313.36] that is why I want us to
get married now.
[343.40] Sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry,
[346.60] you have said such a funny thing that
[350.44] it made me laugh.
[352.48] What is wrong with you?
[354.08] Is this something you
should be joking about?
[358.16] I am not joking Afnan,
I am serious
[360.40] If this is not a joke, then what is it?
[364.36] You know you have this
one problem in you,
[367.08] you don’t understand people’s
situation because of your immaturity.
[370.88] I am so stressed for work,
[373.32] I still got meetings cancelled,
[374.96] to meet you so that
[376.36] I can stand with you in your
problems for your friendship
[379.68] and now you are saying this to me?
[381.28] Come on, there is a limit to drag a joke.
[384.92] Afnan, parents are searching
for proposals for me,
[388.52] that is why I told my parents
everything true about us.
[392.28] And mom wants you to come with
a proposal along with your family.
[397.80] Is that true?
[410.72] I mean you want
[413.88] my family to come to your house
[419.04] with a proposal for marriage?
[462.56] Afnan?
[464.84] What has happened?
[466.56] Where are we going Afnan?
[471.16] Why don’t you respond
what happened?
[479.12] Mom, the weather is so nice, right?
[481.04] Hmm, yes
[483.36] Greetings, Peace be upon you
and God's mercy and blessings.
[485.72] Greetings,
[487.04] Come, brother, sit.
[488.28] How are you, uncle?
[489.52] Absolutely fine, are you doing well?
[495.40] Afnan didn’t come?
[498.48] Afnan didn’t come?
[500.64] He left office way early,
[502.60] he should have gotten here by now.
[504.84] Okay I will check.
[507.36] In fact, Alizey, call him
and ask where is he.
[511.40] Okay mom.
[513.64] Have tea, brother.
[518.40] Thank you.
[538.04] Why this scene?
What is wrong with you?
[539.92] Why were you saying that
you will marry me?
[542.52] How did even this come to your brain?
[544.36] Tell me?
[545.52] what is wrong with you, Afnan?
[547.52] You love me,
[549.04] if you won’t marry me, then
who else will you marry?
[551.04] What is wrong with you?
[553.40] I just talk to you nicely a couple of times,
[554.84] does that mean I will marry you?
[557.40] You didn’t just talk to me
nicely a couple of times,
[559.64] you have always taken care of me,
[561.52] and this is not a friendship,
[562.56] you have been concerned for me,
[564.08] you saved me from a trouble.
[565.40] I just showed sympathy towards to you,
[569.04] I thought that she is probably a naïve girl
[570.80] who might need my guidance
[573.12] and if I can make her a
good friend and guide her,
[576.24] save her from bad people,
so this was not love,
[579.20] that doesn’t mean,
I want to marry you.
[588.48] Please, you must understand.
[589.60] Afnan?
[591.16] What are you saying, Afnan?
[593.80] Do you actually not love me?
[596.84] yes, I truly, falsely, in any world,
I do not love you, Ramsha,
[602.04] but why don’t you
understand this Ramsha?
[605.92] You are joking, right?
[608.00] That is not possible,
[609.12] you have taken such good care of me,
[610.84] you always stood by my side,
[612.04] how can you not love me?
[613.48] Ramsha, Ramsha, for God’s sake,
[615.00] stop crying and whining,
[616.36] don’t make a scene here,
[617.60] don’t force me, look people will see,
[620.64] what will they say? Please don’t do it.
[621.92] No Afnan,
[622.64] you, you first say that you
are joking with me,
[624.72] you love me, right?
[625.76] You love me,
[627.12] You want to marry me, right? Please.
[629.12] Why are you forcing me?
[630.96] I told you,
[633.04] I don’t love you,
[635.20] I have always considered you a friend
[637.76] that is why I helped you, and that’s it.
[640.04] I don’t love you,
[641.56] so should I forcefully
tell you that I love you?
[643.44] Leave it,
[644.80] we won’t be in any sort of
terms from now onwards.
[648.08] I made a mistake that I helped you,
[650.48] its all my fault.
[652.88] This is it. I am sorry,
[655.08] I cannot live with this burden,
[656.84] that si why I am leaving.
[657.72] No Afnan, don’t do this,
[659.08] look I love you and I have told mom
[662.36] that I am coming to meet you,
[663.44] I want to marry you,
[664.60] you love me, I love you…
[666.52] Just shut up!
[668.76] It is not my fault that you
said all this to your mom,
[672.56] but I never said that
I love you or I will marry you,
[678.44] I am telling you,
[679.88] whatever relationship we had
is over from now onwards
[683.76] and please,
[685.16] never try to meet me again,
[687.24] in fact, don’t even try to talk to me.
[689.56] You don’t…
Ramsha, don’t create a scene.
[691.20] Afnan, why don’t you understand?
[693.12] I am telling you.
[693.80] Shut up!
[696.04] Why don’t you understand
what I am saying?
[698.28] Why don’t you understand at once
that I don’t love you, Ramsha?
[706.12] I am sorry
[708.48] but don’t talk to me ever again,
[710.20] don’t try to meet me. This is it! Bye.
[765.88] Alizey,
[767.24] did you call Afnan, where is he?
[770.76] Mom, I didn’t talk to him,
[772.48] I don’t know where he is.
[777.20] I Asked you to call him,
[780.52] but you didn’t call him,
[783.40] how can you be so careless, Alizey?
[786.72] I asked you to call Afnan and
ask him where he is.
[790.68] What is wrong you with you, mom?
[791.96] He must be with his friends.
[795.32] Alizey, call him right now,
[796.84] ask him which friend he is
with and where he is.
[800.52] And when will he come home?
[801.76] Okay I will call him in a bit.
[803.68] Call him right now.
[808.44] Come on pick up the phone, come on.
[825.08] He is not picking up,
[830.36] mom he must be busy somewhere
[831.52] he will call me back,
[832.56] why are you getting worried?
[864.80] I even asked you to take me along,
[866.60] but no you dropped me at Rakshi’s house,
[868.96] I don’t know anything about
what happened afterwards.
[873.12] Ramsha? What happened?
[875.32] Afnan will bring his family, right?
[883.12] Ramsha,
[884.76] you didn’t even tell me anything
on way, at least tell me now.
[890.00] How did the conversation go
between Afnan and you?
[891.36] I am not getting a good vibe,
[892.40] I am getting negative thoughts.
[896.68] Your thoughts are absolutely right, Annie,
[900.68] I didn’t get Afnan?
[902.40] What do you mean by you didn’t get him?
[905.24] He didn’t come to meet you?
[915.24] But you called him a day earlier?
[920.48] You guys even had decided a time to meet,
[922.20] then what happened?
[924.20] I guess there was some misunderstanding
[931.44] and this misunderstanding took me to him
[940.52] and I didn’t get him.
[951.44] It’s good that you came,
[953.08] knead the dough
[954.28] I had to make flatbread for your dad,
[955.56] he wants to have food.
[956.80] Okay Mom.
[957.16] Come, quickly.
[966.44] What? Sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry,
[970.92] for a second I thought you are serious,
[975.44] What is wrong with you?
[976.96] Is this something
you should be joking about?
[979.72] I am not joking Afnan,
I am serious
[981.92] If this is not a joke, then what is it?
[985.76] You know you have this
one problem in you,
[988.64] you don’t understand people’s
situation because of your immaturity.
[992.40] I am so stressed for work,
[994.84] I still got meetings cancelled,
[996.56] to meet you so that
[997.96] I can stand with you in your
problems for your friendship
[1001.12] and now you are saying this to me?
[1002.88] Come on, there is a limit to drag a joke.
[1005.76] Afnan,
[1006.92] parents are searching
for proposals for me,
[1009.32] that is why I told my parents
everything true about us.
[1013.20] And mom wants you to come
with a proposal along with your family.
[1016.80] I mean you want
[1019.12] my family to come to your house
[1022.72] with a proposal for marriage?
[1077.64] Why this scene?
[1080.28] Why were you saying
that you will marry me?
[1083.00] How did even this come
to your brain? Tell me?
[1086.00] what is wrong with you, Afnan?
[1087.96] You love me,
[1089.40] if you won’t marry me,
then who else will you marry?
[1091.40] What is wrong with you?
[1093.88] I just talk to you nicely a couple of times,
[1095.24] does that mean I will marry you?
[1098.64] I thought that she is probably a naïve girl
[1100.32] who might need my guidance
[1102.76] and if I can make her a good friend and guide her,
[1105.72] save her from bad people, so this was not love,
[1108.80] that doesn’t mean, I want to marry you.
[1120.68] Do you actually not love me?
[1123.52] yes, I truly, falsely, in any world,
[1126.16] I do not love you, Ramsha,
[1129.92] but why don’t you understand this.
[1247.32] umm, this is my car,
[1251.84] I guess you were trying to open the door.
[1291.12] Ramsha.
[1295.92] Afnan.
[1298.80] Sit down.
[1300.20] Umm hand.
[1301.88] Sorry.
[1323.52] Okay then go,
[1325.00] you don’t care about me at all,
[1326.48] this shows I am not important
for you at all.
[1329.40] Really?
[1331.48] Look at me?
[1334.40] Hey, look at me.
[1338.16] Yes?
[1341.88] If you weren’t important for me,
[1345.28] I wouldn’t have been here today.
[1371.88] Did you bring me here?
[1373.44] No, no, I just came to visit you.
[1376.36] Of course I brought you here. Y
[1381.16] ou know what would have happened to
you if I hadn’t have come there?
[1385.64] You fainted and you were alone,
[1387.36] your friend left you there alone.
[1394.00] What? Why are you laughing?
[1397.96] I am thinking,
[1400.24] whenever I have called you
in the times of trouble,
[1402.60] you have always come.
[1405.16] The problem is that you
get into trouble a lot.
[1487.84] Hania’s boyfriend shot
her in front of my eyes and
[1493.36] the police blamed me for everything,
[1496.52] I don’t know what would have I done,
[1498.04] if you didn’t come, they were,
[1498.92] they were about to do something
very bad to me.
[1501.28] Ramsha?
[1503.48] Ramsha, how wouldn’t I come?
[1508.08] It was you,
[1510.08] I had to come for you at any cost.
[1515.88] And I know very well that
you haven’t done anything,
[1519.04] you are being framed in the matter,
[1524.04] but I am with you Ramsha,
[1527.08] I will not leave your back in
these difficult times.
[1536.68] You are joking, right?
[1538.80] That is not possible,
[1539.84] you have taken such good care of me,
[1541.32] you always stood by my side,
[1542.72] how can you not love me?
[1544.20] Ramsha, Ramsha, for God’s sake,
[1545.68] stop crying and whining,
[1547.04] don’t make a scene here,
[1548.12] don’t force me,
[1549.68] look people will see,
what will they say?
[1552.08] Please don’t do it.
[1552.52] No Afnan,
[1553.32] you, you first say that you
are joking with me,
[1555.32] you love me, right? You love me,
[1557.80] You want to marry me, right? Please.
[1559.80] Why are you forcing me?
[1561.76] I told you,
[1563.80] I don’t love you,
[1566.04] I have always considered
you a friend that
[1568.48] is why I helped you, and that’s it.
[1570.68] I don’t love you,
[1572.12] so should I forcefully tell
you that I love you?
[1574.08] Leave it,
[1575.52] we won’t be in any sort of terms
from now onwards.
[1578.72] I made a mistake that I helped you,
[1581.12] its all my fault.
[1583.56] This is it.
[1584.76] I am sorry,
[1585.80] I cannot live with this burden,
[1587.52] that si why I am leaving.
[1588.36] No Afnan, don’t do this, look
[1590.00] I love you and I have told mom
that I am coming to meet you,
[1594.00] I want to marry you, 
you love me, I love you…
[1597.20] Just shut up!
[1599.80] It is not my fault that you 
said all this to your mom,
[1603.32] but I never said that 
I love you or I will marry you,
[1609.24] I am telling you,
[1610.44] whatever relationship 
we had is over from now onwards
[1614.92] and please,
[1616.00] never try to meet me again,
[1617.00] You don’t… No Afnan, no.
[1619.40] Ramsha, don’t create a scene.
[1622.44] Afnan, why don’t you understand?
[1624.52] I am telling you.
[1625.24] Shut up!
[1627.32] Why don’t you understand
 what I am saying?
[1629.60] Why don’t you understand at once that
[1631.48] I don’t love you, Ramsha?
[1634.52] I am sorry
[1636.92] but don’t talk to me ever again,
[1638.48] don’t try to meet me. This is it!
[1643.20] Bye.
[1909.76] Hello?
[1914.96] Hello?
[1919.20] At least talk if you had called.
[1926.16] What is this new way of torturing,
[1927.72] that you will call and won’t talk?
[1932.76] Why don’t you understand that
[1933.92] I am getting disturbed by your calls,
[1937.44] it has become difficult for 
me to work in the office,
[1939.04] I am unable to work.
[1943.80] If this is not love, then what is it?
[1950.64] And then you say 
that you don’t love me?
[1954.16] Ramsha, how should
 I make you understand
[1956.80] that I am not liking the fact that you
 are getting disturbed because of me?
[1965.04] And believe me I didn’t want to hurt,
[1968.40] in fact I cannot hurt any person
 in the whole world,
[1977.12] now if you are taking it as 
love then it is your fault,
[1980.76] not mine.
[1986.68] I took care of you as a friend,
[1989.48] I was being nice to you
[1991.72] and this is not my love but
 a part of my brought up.
[1997.96] None of your reasoning 
can convince me, Afnan,
[2004.48] I don’t believe that 
you don’t love me,
[2007.88] you do love me.
[2010.48] I don’t feel sympathy for you
 but I feel angry now,
[2014.40] is this how you talk?
[2017.72] Why are you forcing me?
[2020.64] Has anyone ever forcefully 
loved someone in this world?
[2024.84] It is not possible Ramsha.
[2030.76] Okay you tell me,
[2031.88] if I tell you to love my 
friend Fahad, will you?
[2038.92] Afnan?
[2040.00] You wouldn’t be able to, right?
[2045.40] So why don’t you understand 
this little thing?
[2048.40] There is a limit of being stubborn.
[2050.68] Afnan?
[2129.56] Ramsha didn’t come to have food?
[2131.28] Won’t she have food?
[2133.24] I have been calling her for so long,
[2134.88] I don’t know she is not listening,
[2137.40] I will do one thing, I will go call her.
[2139.68] Leave it,
[2141.12] you have food, she will come.
[2146.52] What are the updates on the proposal?
[2150.12] Did she get any?
[2157.04] I won’t delay her marriage
 as soon as I find any decent proposal.
[2167.28] Why are you quiet?
[2168.92] Answer me?
[2169.92] Are you in conversation with anyone?
[2171.00] Yes,
[2172.56] I have spoken to the matchmaker
[2175.24] to look for a good proposal for Ramsha,
[2178.60] we cannot get a good 
proposal that soon,
[2182.88] it will take some time.
[2188.04] Hmm, okay.
[2220.32] Why aren’t you having food?
[2224.40] Are you not hungry?
[2225.84] No mom, I am not hungry right now.
[2236.68] Did you talk to that boy?
[2245.72] umm, actually, umm, mom,
[2249.20] he has gone out of country,
[2255.44] his number is switched 
off so I couldn’t talk to him.
[2259.96] if you talk to him now,
[2263.00] do let him know that your 
dad is looking for a match for you,
[2269.76] so he should send his 
parents as soon as possible
[2273.80] because your dad wants to get
 you married as soon as possible.
[2278.16] Okay mom.
[2280.92] okay, take this.
