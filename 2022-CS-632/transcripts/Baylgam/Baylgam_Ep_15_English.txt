Why are you sitting there? Come sit here with me, I won’t eat you. That script you were talking about, I know it but the location that I had to shoot at, another director is shooting
there already, as soon as his shoot ends, we will start our shoot, that’s why our schedule has been disturbed. Forget all this, tell me, have you ever come to
Islamabad before? No, umm, I couldn’t come to Islamabad
coincidentally, but I have travelled
a lot of places. Okay. Yes. So, so then let’s go, let me give you a tour of Islamabad. Definitely, but not today, actually I have a friend, she lives in Islamabad,
I have to meet her today. I will go with you some other day. We will first take a tour
of Islamabad together, then you can go meet your friend. Go. Umm, actually. Go get nicely dressed. Hmm. Mehnaz? Mehnaz? yes? I gave you some money
to keep it, bring it, I have to return it. Okay, I’ll just get them. Hurry up. Where did I keep it? Where did it go?
I kept them here only. Hey, Mehnaz, these are Rs 100,000, I have to give them to Adil,
keep them safe, okay? Ramsha, I cannot face the world because of you. Come already, where are you? Mehnaz? You are standing here? I am waiting for you there. Brother Sabir is waiting for
me to get the money. Where is the money?
Come on, give it to me. Why are you looking at my face? Give me money, where is it? Umm, actually, actually Sajid, umm, I… What do you mean by I I I? Where is the money? Sajid, actually I spent that money. Are you out of your mind? Someone made me keep
it as their possession, you spent it? Sajid, actually, Ramsha’s engagement
was being planned so I spent the money in shopping. And it is my mistake that
I forgot to tell you. Both of you mother and
daughter have decided to get me humiliated on purpose, right? I don’t know what sins have
I done in the past that I got punished by getting you as a wife
and that disobedient daughter. Sajid, don’t worry, I will get the committee
amount next month, I will give you the complete amount back. You and your money can go to hell! You guys have made me fed up, if it was in my control, I would have gone and committed suicide. Sajid? Sajid? What did you do Ramsha? You stole money from your own house. I didn’t raise you like that? Why did you do that? You brought so much
dishonor for your parents. It would have been better had
I died before seeing this day. Come on now, let’s take a selfie, come. Friendship selfie, right? Okay so now, tell me what will you eat or drink. Nothing sir, I was saying that it has gotten a bit late,
let’s go home. What is wrong with you? What happened? Get used to all this, you are about to become a star, A star! Hanging out, and eating
out is very normal. The shoot happens for the entire day,
the entire day and you are already tired. Let’s do one thing, let’s just have juice from here and we will have dinner together, somewhere out. No, no, sir, actually… I mean, I don’t know but I feel that
I am not feeling well so I was saying let’s go home. Wait a minute, what happened to you? No, no, no, sir I am just generally
not feeling well. I don’t have a fever. What happened to you? You are a lucky girl that you are sitting here at this
table with me right now, else people die to get
a picture with me. Hmm? Hmm. Juice? You will at least have juice, right? Hmm? Get two juices. And you are not well so add less ice to it. Hania, by the way, do you know he is a very disgusting man. He tries to touch me whenever I talk to him, tries to hold my hand, he acts so strange, is he a psycho? Didn’t you find any other producer
or director to send me to? The environment of this house is
already so suffocating and on top of that I have to tolerate
this problem of a man. It is getting very difficult for me, Hania. But earlier you were saying that I felt so nice to meet him, he has such a huge house, such a beautiful house, what has happened to you now? Your opinion changed in just two days? 2 days? Seriously Hania? It has been 2 weeks since I am here and he hasn’t gotten any shoot
done from me, no work at all. Whenever I talk to him about work, he starts giving me run arounds, he makes some excuse every time. Is that how work is done? I don’t think he plans to
give me any work. Ramsha, Ramsha, Ramsha, have some patience, it takes months for such work. And tell me something if Danish Kamal had no interest in you then why would he
call you from Karachi? He is not short on getting talent. For now, that’s what I think that he doesn’t have any
interest in my work. Oh God! You just start to
mistrust everyone so soon. Look, a lot of things
happen in this work, these handshakes and hugs are very common here. Now that you have stepped in to this field, learn the lifestyle involved in it. This is the lifestyle of this field. Whatever it is, Hania, I am telling you that I don’t want to live here. I don’t want to work with this person. Talk to Shahmir and tell him to send me somewhere good, I need to do good work, and good shoots. I don’t want to live here, I don’t want to waste my time, I want to work, Hania,
I want to be renowned, I cannot bear this anymore, I feel that both my time and talent is getting wasted here. My work has no value in front of him. Oh God! Ramsha, you are… Okay, I will talk to them and let you know then. I am waiting for you, let me know soon. Okay. And as long as marriage
is concerned, I will let you guys know myself when
I would want to get married. What? What did you say? You will talk to your dad
about your marriage yourself and will tell him when do you
want to get married? Won’t you be ashamed in saying that? What is there to be ashamed about? It is my marriage so I will tell him. Hey? Ramsha, look girls have a certain age
bracket to get married and if that crosses then it gets difficult to
find good matches. And if you get married on the right time, your parents are also at peace. My beloved mom, your mind has become like ancient times, I have a lot of proposals right now and I have a lot of age bracket too, hmm? I will find a good match myself. Sister in law? You haven’t slept yet? It’s so late. When a daughter leave home
without her parents’ permission, she takes with her their sleep, their honor, respect, grace and everything along with her. Whatever happened, sister in law, it is not your fault. It is very late at night, come on, try to sleep. Salma, if some stranger would have
given me this pain, I swear to God I would have called them names and said them bad things
to calm myself down but I am a mother, I cannot even curse her, I still pray to God that wherever she is, may God protect her, may she stay safe from any hardships, every hardship. Alizey, I and your uncle wants that you don’t delay your marriage any further now. Mom, why didn’t you do one thing? You should have come directly to the airport, in fact, you should have even
brought uncle there, you guys should have fixed
my marriage date there first and then we could have come home. How did you wait for
me to come home? By the way, I was expecting such
a stupid answer from you. Mom, just think then, you started as soon as I came. Okay now ask Farida to bring
my things to my room, I am going to my room and when will Afnan come? It will take him a few days to come back. You get freshen up and you can call him yourself and ask. Okay, fine. Yes, Hania, I think that I got cursed by my parents, that is why I am not getting any work. Talk to Shahmir and ask him to get me good work, I want to do some good work. You know I have just come here to make my future, I want to work and earn money, I want to earn so well that I can face my parents in the future and tell them that I eloped from home to make a
good future for myself here. Please talk to Shahmir and get me some good work, please. Ma’am? Boss is calling you. Okay, fine, you may go, I am coming. Okay. Okay, listen? I will talk to you later but please, talk to Shahmir and ask him to get me good work. Okay bye. I pray that he is calling me for the script. Let me go see it. Where is sir? He is downstairs at the pool, come. Come. She is coming, sir. Sir, I think you are busy,
I will come back in a while. Wait, wait. I am never busy for such people who are interested in their work. Sit down. Umm, sir, umm tell me about the script. What are the updates on the script? I have called you here to talk about it. Do one thing, get ready and let’s go out. Out? we will sit in the fresh air, have a good cup of coffee and then we will discuss the script. And after all this, we will also go shopping. Why shopping? Shopping. We have to prepare for the shoot as well, we need to get dresses
for your character. What? Does it mean the location for
the shoot has been finalized? Shall I answer all the questions here? Go get ready, you will get the answers to all
your questions on the way, hmm? Okay sir, I will quickly get ready and come. Listen? yes. Dress up nicely, that can enhance your beauty. Actually, this is showbiz, here what is seen, is sold. Yeah? And then after shopping, I also have to introduce
you to your male co-star who will be acting opposite
to you in the serial. Really? Okay, sir, I will quickly
go get ready then. Wow! What a perfume. Oh Annie, I wish you were here today, you would have seen that I am about to work with a big
director like Danish Kamal, I will be the heroin of his drama. I would have told you that he has gotten me so many new expensive dresses for my character in the new project and he has also bought me shoes, and jewelry, and a lot of branded perfumes as well. And this phone, I would have shown you that he has also bought me a new expensive phone. You would have been so
surprised to see it but I wish, Oh Annie, I wish you were here. I feel like telling you all this. Anyway, what can be done now? It’s better that I enjoy it alone. Hmmm, these shoes are so nice, right? Give the prescription for
the medicines to Anwar, he will bring it, I will leave for the shop now. Okay I will. Greetings, sister Mehnaz, greetings brother Sajid. Were you gone somewhere? I was actually not well so I went to see the doctor. I just went to get the medicines. It’s great that you went to the doctor. By the way, where is Ramsha? I hadn’t seen her for so many days, I didn’t even see her going to the university I didn’t see her at home, as well. By the way, I came to your home
the day before yesterday, I didn’t even see her at home. Has she gone somewhere? Umm Ramsha? She has gone to my elder sister’s
home in Nawabshah, she is not well so till she gets better
she will live there with her. Okay, I heard something else. What did you say? What do you mean?
What have you heard? Hey sister, you know that people are habitual of talking, I will suggest you call Ramsha home
as soon as possible so people can shut up. You cannot leave young children
at relatives’ houses nowadays. Do you understand what I am saying? Hello? You even said that you would take out time for 
me and meet me, but since I have come here, you have been busier than myself, you aren’t giving me time at all. Because you have so many 
people to entertain you. What do you mean? Nothing. Listen, no one can be what you are to me. By the way, shall I say something? I, now admit that you are an expert in acting. You have such good dialogue delivery, you give such good expressions, everything seems to be absolutely true, that is why I think you have a very bright future in this industry. What does that mean? Are you complimenting me or taunting me? I am unable to understand, please tell me clearly what 
you are trying to say. Uhhmm, I will explain it to 
you sometime later, I am getting late right now, I have to get somewhere. I will talk to you later, bye. But Afnan, listen to me, I… Did you get scared? No sir, I am not scared of anyone. Actually, I didn’t expect that you would come to my room, 
without knocking. Sorry, I came because, I wanted you to wear that 
dress and show me, the one that I have bought for you. Why? I mean, are we going somewhere? No. I want to see you in that dress, I have called the photographer, he will take your pictures, stills, for the serial, that is why I wanted 
you to wear that dress. So, quickly get ready, I am waiting. Okay sir, fine. Come quickly, hmm? Ill-mannered. Thank God that the photographer is coming, at least the work will start. I will quickly go and get ready. Wow! The dress looks so pretty, right? The earrings look nice too. Now I hope the photographer just 
quickly clicks good pictures of me, then just see how I get the pictures taken today. Yes? Yes? Boss is calling you. Okay, you may go, I am coming. Ma’am, boss is calling you to his room. Okay, you may go. I am coming. okay madam. Why is he calling me to his room? The photographer might be sitting there. It’s okay. Let’s see what happens. Come in. Come, baby, come, you actually look very
 beautiful in this dress. Delicate, beautiful, exactly like the heroin of my drama. Just wait and watch, you will go very high after 
working with me in this drama, very high. Thank you, sir. It is just your eyes that made me a heroin at first sight. Why are you standing? Sit down. umm, sir, the photographer
 didn’t come yet? Are we shooting inside the 
room or outside somewhere? Some of the shoot will 
take place in this room and some of it will take
 place outside in the lounge, hmm. Okay. So the photographer is in 
the drawing room? Where is he? The photographer will come, what is the rush? What do you mean by he will come, sir? He should have come by now. I am sorry, I mean, it has been so late, why didn’t he come yet? Sir, you have given all of
 them so much leverage. I have spoken to him, 
he is on his way, and then the shoot will start. 
You, sit down. Umm, sir… Umm, I will get
 my phone in two minutes, I want to show you something… Hey, forget about the phone, we don’t need the phone, actor shouldn’t have their phone
 with them when they are working, or else they lose focus. You should concentrate 
entirely on your work. Today, you are working in my drama, you are a drama heroin, and you will soon become 
a film heroine as well. Hmm? Yes, sir, okay, yes sir, you are absolutely right, that’s what I am going to do. I’ll do exactly like you say, same. When I saw you for the very first time, I had an idea at the very moment that you will become 
a superstar one day. Hmm. That is why I even spoke to Shahmir. Sit down. Sir actually… I will check. No, wait, I will see. Okay. What happened? Ma’am Alisha is here,
 she wants to meet you. Dude! You know that I don’t want to meet her, then? Sir I told her but she is insisting that she 
wants to meet you right now. You should have told her 
that I am not at home. Sir, I am sorry. I am sorry. Go make her sit, I am coming. Okay. Wait for 2 minutes, just 2 minutes, I will be right back. What have I gotten into?
