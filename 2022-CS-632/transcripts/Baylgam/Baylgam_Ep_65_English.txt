Take this. Any idea how long will it take 
to get the visa? And when you get the tickets for me? Brother Shani, don’t worry at all, your visa and ticket will be here soon. Since you have made the complete payment,
your work will be done soon as well. That’s fine but when? I am telling you your work 
will be done soon, since you have made the full payment,
 your work will be done soon too. Yes, Wasim was praising you a lot and he was saying that 
you are very good with work and you get it done quickly. Yes, yes, that’s how it is, you just do your preparation to leave, your work is about to get done soon. Yes, yes, the preparations 
are complete, don’t worry about that. Okay then what is the wait for? You might be in Dubai by next week, just remember, don’t forget your brother 
once you get to Dubai. Yes, yes, don’t worry about that obviously if you are doing something nice 
for me how can I forget you? I will remember you. Just get me to Dubai once. Don’t worry at all, you won’t have to face any problems, 
okay? Okay sir, I shall leave now. Thank you so much, and you can call me 
if you have any query, okay? Thank you. Whenever I try that there is 
no complaint from your end, that’s it, you make a mistake right 
then and there. Alizeh, just because of your 
own foolish actions, brother and Afnan are being 
negative about you. Just pray that Ramsha leaves 
as soon as possible from here else you will be living in hell here, just remember this. Afnan? 
Hmm? I was saying why don’t you try talking to Shani? I guess if Ramsha talks to him, 
he might not listen but if you or uncle do, 
he might listen to you guys. By the way, uncle is not well and if Shani misbehaves with uncle, he might not be able to bear it. So it will be better that 
you try to talk to him once. You are saying as if I will talk and Shani will immediately 
listen to me. He might. And look if something good happens for Ramsha
by any of our actions then that’s good. Afnan, I am actually very guilty, I am very sad that whatever is 
happening with Ramsha is not right. I am blaming myself, I guess it was my mistake that 
I took her there, I am a woman too I can understand
 her pain. And now I think that 
I shouldn’t have taken her there I don’t know what I should do. Relax, whatever will happen, it will be 
good from God’s end. I’ll go change. What are you doing here? May I sit? Umm, I went to your shop, I found out that you are here 
so I came here to meet you. I wanted to talk about something 
really important. About what? Shani, I wanted to request you 
that if you can, if you can come and bring Ramsha 
back to your home. Oh, so you are being her advocate? No, it’s not that. Look whatever happened was 
an accident, there was nothing true in it, 
you are having a misunderstanding. Ramsha is a very noble 
and sincere girl, and being your wife, 
she loves you a lot. Today I saw her crying for you, 
she was shedding tears. Wow, so that means her tears have 
brought you to a nobody like me? By the way, my wife is very fortunate, I mean, someone else also cares about her 
tears apart from her husband. It’s not that, I am telling you that you are having
a misunderstanding, you should let the poison of doubt 
out of your heart. I am telling you again and again that 
she loves you a lot being your wife. There is nothing between us. And she is not well, she doesn’t feel good, 
I am afraid that God forbid, something happens to her 
in this condition, then? It doesn’t make any difference to me. You are a very insensitive man, you will regret it a lot. Hey, hey, get lost from here. I have no regrets, 
do you understand? Come on, get lost, come on, 
come on, go. I thought you are a very intelligent man, but you turned out to be a big fool. You even forgot how living with 
Ramsha can be so beneficial for you. What benefit? Do you remember what I said? If you keep Ramsha happy, I will give you what you want, I guess you forgot this deal, so I am offering you the same deal again, don’t cause any trouble to Ramsha, Keep her happy and it’s my job to fulfill my promise. I am offering again, take your time to think. Annie, stop this crying and whining. My friend like sister is in so much pain, you guys don’t care at all. Ask brother to bring Ramsha home. What do you think? Wouldn’t I ask Shani? I have told him a lot of times but 
he doesn't hear, he is stubborn, I am fed up, myself. I don’t know anything, let’s go to
Mr. Qasim’s house, I cannot leave Ramsha alone 
during this time. We cannot go to Mr. Qasim’s house. Why, mom? Why can’t we go? Since when have we become 
so feelingless that we left her alone to suffer 
all the pain? Try to understand the sensitivity 
of the situation, Annie, I don’t have the answer to 
Mr. Qasim’s questions, I cannot face him. Till Shani cools down, it is better for us not to go there. And yes, if you care so much 
about your friend, you must pray to God that He makes things better for her and make Shani merciful towards her and love for and that Shani 
brings her home himself. Uncle? I want to go back home. Come sit here, my child. I want the same for you that your in-laws 
come here and take you home. I have been trying to call Anwar 
for a few days but he is not attending it. By the way Ramsha, I have never seen such in-laws ever. What sort of uncle and 
aunt do you have? If your aunt loves you so much, 
she should have convinced Shani and come here and should have 
taken you from here but it has been so many days, she didn’t even ask about 
your well-being. Shani doesn't get convinced so easily. I am sure Aunt must have definitely 
tried to convince him. Leave it, Ramsha, if your aunt cared so much, you wouldn't be here but at your in-laws. Uncle, I know Shani is very adamant on his words, he will never come to take me back. Please let me go home on my own. Ramsha, my child you haven’t completely 
recovered yet. Shani’s behavior is in front of you, I don’t want to take any risk 
regarding your health. Let’s wait for a while more,
 if they don’t come, I and Afsheen will go and 
talk to them our self. Don’t worry, okay? If not my permission, but you can at least inform me, 
I am your wife. Yes, and that is my problem, that is why I have to tolerate you else… You don’t care at all, right Shani? You will leave me in this condition 
and go to Dubai? Yes I am going, and when I will be going there is 
no need to make a scene out of it because I am not going to stop. I am just traying to pay for 
my husband’s sins. Sister-in-law, I am very embarrassed, whatever happened to you is very wrong, forgive me, never curse my children. What are you saying Salma? Why will I curse them? I have no complaints with you, I have no complaints with you. if your aunt cared so much, you wouldn't be here 
but at your in-laws. Come in. Ramsha? Quickly pack your bags, 
wear your shawl and let’s go. Why? Is Shani here? 
No, no, Shani is not here. So? Did uncle and aunt come? No, no, none of them has come but if you want to go home yourself
you can, I will just take you there. Look Ramsha, don’t be upset. I know it very well that 
you miss your family a lot, I have seen you squirming for Shani, you are even doing so much to save 
my relationship with Alizeh, so can I not do such a small thing
to save your relationship? And I know you must hesitate 
to go home yourself but I will be with you. And you can win the heart of your family
 by your patience. So that is why, have courage and be strong,
and come with me. Okay I will get my shawl. Okay I am waiting for you in the car. Just stop here, Afnan. Here? I will go in alone, you don’t come, please. Okay. If Shani sees me with you, 
he will get more upset. As you wish. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Who is it? Who is it? Ramsha? How are you, Annie? I am absolutely fine. It’s good that you came, 
I missed you a lot. I missed you all a lot too. Do you know 
I was really missing you. How are Uncle and Aunt? Everyone is fine. How are you? 
How are you feeling? I am absolutely fine. 
Annie. Greetings Shani. How dare you come here? Get out of here. Shani, where will I go 
if I won’t come here? You, you just sit here for 10 minutes
 and listen to me then you can take whatever 
decision you feel like. I said get out else 
I will drag you outside. Brother, let her come in at least.
Shut up, Did I ask for your suggestion? Go inside. Annie, go call Uncle and aunt. Go. They are not home, 
they have gone to a funeral. Brother, let mom and dad come first 
and then you can take a decision. Ramsha, let’s go in right now. 
Wait here, I will drag you out of here in front of 
the whole neighborhood, I will do this if you want. Why are you so merciless? If I will not come to this house, 
where else will I go Shani? This is my house. You are my Husband, 
and I am your wife. You are asking me to leave 
my own house? Look Shani, even after so much has happened, 
I still came back in this house again just for you so I can spend my life with you, I will die if you push me away from you. Don’t make me mad, I am telling 
you are making me so angry that I will say something that you won’t be
able to come back to this house again. Okay fine, she is leaving, Ramsha, mom and 
dad are not here, you know his anger. Don’t you understand?
Get out of here. She is leaving, don’t say anything, please. Ramsha, go, go from here right now. You go inside too! What happened? What happened? Why are you so worried?
 Is everything okay? Come, come sit in the car, come. Now tell me what happened? Tell me, tell me, answer me, if Shani has misbehaved with you
so I will go talk to him. No Afnan, Shani is very angry right now, he will fight with you for no reason, just leave from here for now. Here, have water. Water. Tell me something what happened. Take me home. Who asked you to come to this house
without Ramsha? You are our father now? You will take all the decisions? Do you know because of you how much have we 
heard from Mr. Qasim today? You haven’t left me capable to face him, I am afraid he will cancel the contract of our shop. He will ruin our business along 
with the relationships. You care about the shop as if 
we are getting a lot from it. Don’t forget that all these luxuries 
that you have, all the luxuries are because of that shop. This taunt is not going to last 
very long as well. I am going to Dubai. What you earn in a year from this shop, I will earn it in a month and show you. Do you see him? Do you see your child’s mouth? How he is talking in front of his dad. He hasn’t started earning yet, I am afraid the day he starts to earn 
he will beat us with shoes on our heads. So you are continuously taunting me too. Okay quiet, we are talking about Ramsha and you guys
have taken this somewhere else. And Shani, stop being angry, go and bring Ramsha with you, this is not good that our daughter-in-law 
is living at someone else’s house. Ramsha won’t come in this house. And I will see who can bring her here. Look, look at his stubbornness 
and adamant-ness, listen to me, I will bring her here, I and I will see what you can do. Okay dad, you bring her here and
if I say something wrong then don’t say anything to me.
Oh please! You are one to talk. Umm dad, did you call me? Yes. You took Ramsha to her house? I am asking you something. Yes dad. 
Why? Why did you do this without 
my permission? Why are you quiet now?
 Answer me. Because I cannot see tears 
in Ramsha’s eyes. I want her to be happy 
with Shani that’s why. Don’t tell me all this. Do you have any idea that what you have done can ruin 
her home instead of making it, what is this foolish step? Thank God that Shani didn’t see you 
with Ramsha else he would have created havoc. I even advised you and warned you 
to stay away from Ramsha’s matters, I told you and now this is the last time 
I am warning if you ever do any sort of interference 
in Ramsha’s matter, it won’t be good for you. You may go now. May God give some brain to these kids, they don’t understand the sensitivity 
of these matters. What is this behavior? I have already paid 5 lacs, now 
what is this extra money for? Dude, the policy has changed, the visa fee has increased, 
you will have to pay 5 lac more. Do you guys think I am mad? I won’t give a penny more, even if I had money, 
I still wouldn’t give it. I told you what the agent told me,
now as you wish. If you want your money back, 
I will ask him to give your money back. Okay, ask him to refund my money. Okay I will tell him but remember one thing, you won’t get the complete amount back,
25% will be deducted. What do you mean I won’t get 
the whole amount back? I need the entire amount back. You are saying as if the agent has 
your payment in his pockets, obviously he must have given it 
to people to get the work done. Try to understand what I am saying. It is just 5 lac rupees, arrange it from somewhere. And there is a huge difference between
the currency here and there, you will get the money back 
in 2 to 4 months. It will be in your pocket and 
then you will live your life easily. Try to understand what I am saying.
