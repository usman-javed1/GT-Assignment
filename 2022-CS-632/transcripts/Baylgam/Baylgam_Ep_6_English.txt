Your uncle was talking about your
and Afnan’s wedding. So, I told him that we should get you two engaged. Now you tell me what date to finalize? Did you talk to Afnan? Ask him as well. Afnan is just not my nephew,
 in fact he is like my son. I know well what he likes and dislikes. Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. Okay mama, I will go now. Hey, where are you going? 
I will drop you. No, no, there is no need for that. Now you will not drop me 
to the office daily. Yes, so I can drop you daily as well. I like spending time with you anyway. Now whether it is for a few moments
 or for my whole life. Afnan is right. After all, he has to take up 
your responsibility later on, then why not now? Aunt. See, this is how two smart people are, and there are certain who don’t understand
 anything. Okay, shall we go, 
Mr. Smarty pants? Come on. Come. Aunt, I will come. 
Goodbye. Goodbye. 
Okay, goodbye. This is why I was telling you 
we should take a rickshaw. Damn miser. The bus will be here soon. It is so hot, my skin gets ruined like this. You two? Brother, you? Yes, I was going for some work. Come on, I will drop you home. Thank God you came, 
it is really hot anyway. Come on, Ramsha. 
One minute. Wait. Whose car is this? A friend’s car. God will give my brother an even
better can than this. Hah, day dreaming. Did you say something?
Huh? No. Come on. Come on. Quickly. 
I feel really hot. I will sit in the front. The AC works better in the front.
Come on, quickly. What happened? Did the car breakdown brother? The ice cream here is really good. I thought I would get it for you people.
Do you people want to have it? What is the matter? You are being really good with us, today. Yes, think that I felt like it. Anyway, I feel I should have mercy
on you people once in a while. Really? Then do one thing, sit here, comfortably, have mercy, 
we will go have ice cream. Hey, wait. Wait. Wait. 
Where are you people going? I will get the ice cream, you people will sit
in the car and eat it. No, there is no fun sitting here 
and eating ice cream? We will eat it at the restaurant. 
Sit, calmly. Your brother is really weird, you know. It will be fun. We should just get ice cream. 
Whether in the car or at the restaurant. You are a really boring girl. Here you go. I had asked for the mango flavor. Hey, this is their famous flavor, try it. You got it by yourself. Shall we go? Does anyone want 
anything else? It is tasty. I couldn’t find my charger, 
so I thought I would use yours. Hey, so everything I own is yours. All okay? You are in a really romantic mood 
nowadays? Really? Do you feel this way? That’s how it is. What is bad in that? It is a good thing. One minute. This is surely bad. In what? That you cut the call without seeing. What do you think? 
I will doubt you? No, but you know there is a question, will you really ever doubt me? Should I tell you the truth? One minute. What is it, Afnan? Why are you cutting my call 
again and again? I am restless to talk to you. I will try again. Why are you not attending the call? Hey it is not that necessary 
to attend the call. Leave it. Tell me, will you ever doubt my love? Hmmm, you do one thing, you talk. 
We will talk later. Hey, no, it is not an important call. Pick the call. Mama. What are you cooking? Hey son, I am cooking 
the potato meat you like, but now don’t eat anything 
from outside and come home. What is the matter? No. No. Do you want to talk about something? Yes, mama, this… I don’t understand how do I talk to you. I… I have been meaning to say something 
to you for a few days now. Child, what is it that you have to 
think so much? They are talking about looking for 
a proposal for Ramsha, right? Yes, they are looking for a proposal. Sister-in-law and brother Sajid want 
that it is someone we know. So do you have a friend, then tell me. No. No? Then? I was thinking if you talk about me for Ramsha, 
with elder mama, then…. What are you saying, Shani? Mama, what is so surprising in this? No, all my life I felt that you and Ramsha don’t get along, you always scold her. You two don’t get along at all. Hey, mama, leave it. I am telling you, you try and talk to elder mama and papa. No, son, Shani, think well once, because this is a decision for life and I want that your and Ramsha’s 
temperament don’t match at all. So… Mama, whatever I am saying, 
I am saying it after thinking. You talk to them. I will be back for dinner. Yes, ask Mr. Shafiq to email me that file. I am waiting. He cut the call again. What is the problem, Afnan? This man never picks up my call. Hello. Hello. Greetings Afnan. Greetings. I have been calling you for so long. I called so many times, 
why don’t you answer my call? I was just a little busy. 
You tell me, is all okay? I am fine. I feel you don’t have time for me at all. No, nothing like that.
I am just a little busy. There is a lot of work in the office. Yes, so? If you cannot talk to me
 in the office, so what? You talk to me when you get home. Call me when you are at home. When I am at home, I want to spend 
most of my time with my family. I like spending time with my family. Hmmm... that’s great. You think well. Or else when do boys of today want 
to spend time at home. They just go around with friends, 
at times here, at times there. You know my cousin, Shani, he goes around with his friends 
all day long. We don’t see him at home. We don’t know when he comes and 
when leaves, we don’t find out. And you know that’s the thing 
with all boys…Hello? Yes?
Are you listening? At times I feel I keep on talking and
you cut the call and leave. No, no, I am listening, you talk. Okay Afnan, I wanted to talk to you about 
something important. Yes, go ahead. May I come in, sir? Yes, come. Afnan, I…that I…. Listen, I will call you back. Bye. No, no, I want to talk. Hello, Afnan?
 I wanted to talk to you. What is the problem? 
He doesn’t listen to me completely. He always cuts the call. Sir, I want to talk to you about 
something important. Have a seat. Afnan, I want to talk to you 
about something important. You don’t have time to talk on the phone. You please meet me, please. Okay. Okay. Fine. One minute, sir. Afnan, I want to talk to you 
about something important. You don’t have time to talk on the phone. You please meet me, please. Sorry. Yes, go ahead. 
Yes… Yes! By the way, isn’t this lip colour really light? I will put on a dark one. You know, the dark one will look good. Come on. Isn’t it a bit much. What have I done to my hair today? My hair doesn’t look good at all. What has happened to me? 
I usually look really good, but why is everything looking 
so bad today? I don’t know if Afnan will like me or not? Anyway, we will see. There are those girls 
who don’t take a scarf or veil, and then there are girls like us who wear an entire tent going anywhere. I have to do all this because of mama 
and papa. I don’t know how Afnan will find me 
in this getup. Okay. I am not putting a scarf on my head. Hello. 
Hello. How are you? 
What are you doing? Nothing, I am working. Why? What happened? Alizeh, I have a really busy day today. I have a lot of meetings lined up. I won’t be able to come pick you up. Is it possible that you go yourself? Oh, okay, I was thinking we would go for 
dinner today. Hey, you should have told me earlier, I would have canceled my meeting. Okay no problem, we will go later. You finish your work. 
Are you sure? Yes. Don’t worry. Shall we plan for tomorrow? Fine. Thank you. Okay. I will see you. Bye. Bye. Ramsha…
Yes? I wanted to ask you something. Yes? You are coming from a wedding, 
right now, right? No. You are not coming from a wedding? Then you must surely be coming 
from a birthday. Not at all. I get it. I get it. You have to go to a musical evening 
or mendhi function on your way back, right? Hey, no Afnan, what is wrong? Why are you asking me this 
again and again? Why don’t I ask you? Look at your dress. You are wearing 
such a heavy dress, the makeup is so loud, so I need to ask. I dressed up for you and came. Really? But I never asked you to dress up 
so much. Hey, I thought I would dress up for you
and you would like it. You don’t look good at all. You know, your beauty is in your simplicity, in your innocence. Stay this way. Don’t wear such a heavy dress, 
don’t wear so much makeup. Okay fine, I will be careful in future. Okay tell me, what was the important thing 
you called me for. You don’t talk to properly on the phone. You don’t have time for me at all. So, I thought I would sit in front of you
 and talk. Yes, so tell me, what is the matter? 
Tell me something. Afnan, I am really worried. So worried that I have lost my sleep and there is no peace in my life. Wont you ask what happened? Hey you are talking so much, I have been asking you for so long, 
what happened? Tell me. My parents want to marry me. Your marriage?
Yes. But why? Why are they in such a hurry? Make them understand, tell them that you want to resume your education, so you cannot get married right now. I am tired of making them understand. Those people are not ready to listen to me. Okay relax. Don’t get so stressed so quickly. Hey, you tell them that you want to be the girl from today’s times. A girl who is strong, independent,
 well educated, someone who can stand on her own feet. I am sure they will agree. This is Afnan’s car. But what is it doing outside 
this restaurant? If you say these things, 
they will be convinced. You know, I have several such examples…. Ramsha. Hello. Hello. Yes, Afnan, where are you? I… I have come for an official meeting. You are in the office. No. Yes. Why? What happened? 
Why are you asking? No, nothing. 
I thought I would just ask again if you are free. Okay. Ramsha, we will have to leave. I have a very important meeting, 
I have to go. No. No. No, Afnan. Not right now. 
Right now, sit comfortably. I have to talk to you about a lot of things. Hey, I am telling you, I will talk to you later.
 Please, let me go. Afnan, we have still not eaten anything. I will feed you something on the way.
Come on, we will have to leave from here right now. 
You are always in a hurry. No problem. Sister-in-law. Where is Ramsha? Hey, Salma, she went to her friend’s place. Sister-in-law, don’t mind but Ramsha going to her friends daily 
like this is not good. At times someone has a birthday, 
someone has a party. There is also my daughter Annie. I don’t let her go alone like this. Salma, you know Ramsha. Wherever she goes, 
she makes friends. Now see, she is a child, 
what all do I tell her not to do? You are right. 
You get to know people. But girls going to the home of others 
doesn’t look nice. Salma, the daughters are 
in their parents’ home, they can go around wherever they want. Now see, she will be married in future. God knows what sort of in-laws she will get. Whether they let her come and go,
 anywhere. So, thinking this, your brother 
and I don’t say no to her. Sit. Sit. Just pray that she gets married 
in a good home. Hey sister-in-law, you stop worrying 
about Ramsha’s proposal. You just think that Ramsha will live with her 
in-laws the same way she lives in her home. What do you mean? Meaning, Anwar and I already wanted 
to talk to you. So now that sister-in-law has 
touched on the topic, I thought I would also talk to you. Anwar and I were thinking that we put 
for Shani’s proposal for Ramsha… Look brother, Ramsha is our only daughter, she is the daughter of the home, 
she will stay at home. She will stay in front of the eyes of 
both of you, you people will be happy. As far as Shani is concerned, so he has been brought up in your hands,
you know him well. Brother, whatever decision you make, we will accept it. Anwar, give me some time, then we will talk about this. 
Yes, brother. Sure. Yes. Make tea. 
Yes. Papa, what happened? 
How long will it take? I don’t know child, the car is not starting. That is why I always tell you 
to buy a new car, but when do you listen to me? Hey, what do we have to do 
getting a new car? It is a fine car, it was running fine,
it broke down now. What happened elder papa? Man, I don’t know 
what happened to the car. It was working fine, 
it is not working. I was going to drop her 
to her friend’s home. I have to drop her at the 
degree college area. Yes, so I am also going there, 
I will drop her. Okay fine, you go with Shani. I will go get a mechanic. On the bike? I go on the bike, what else do I go on? Do you know how to drive it 
or will you make me fall? Why? What happened? 
Don’t you trust me? Should I tell you the truth? I don’t trust you even this much. But okay, I will trust you today. Ramsha, it is my promise to you that 
I will never let you fall. Come on, now. Awww…thank you so much, you have done me a favour.
 Shall we go now? Yes, yes, come on.
 Come. Come. Say three, two, one,
 I will be ready. Yes, yes, okay. I am doing it. 
Come on Three. Two. One. Annie, who is there? I am over here.
Look here and shoot. You know nothing. Look at this. 
I will stand here. Pan the camera up from my feet 
to my face and I will bounce my hair like this, 
then bring it on my face. Okay. Okay. 
Got it? Yes. 
Ready? Ready. 
Come on. Come on. Come on. Three. Two. One. Hello. I am here. Here is my face. You had asked me to move 
from the face from the feet. What is wrong? 
You don’t have to get stuck. Do it properly. Come on. Three. Two. One. Ready. What happened now, Annie? Do you know what is going on 
in the home? Do you care about anyone or not? I know well what is going on 
in this home. That is why I went to meet that Afnan. What? You went to meet Afnan again? You are saying it like 
I go to meet him daily. You know, if it was up to me, I would go to meet him daily. You know, talking to him, seeing him, listening to him talk… I like him so much and he too likes me a lot. Are you mad? What is there to go mad in this? After all, I told him about my proposal. Another proposal has come for you, 
about which you have no idea. I am tired of making mama understand. Once I get my hands on the aunt 
that brings proposals, after that I will make her forget 
the way to this home. The aunt that brings proposals didn’t bring it. Whatever, buddy. What difference does it make to me?
I will not get married. Ramsha, you don’t understand me. You tell me, what did Afnan say hearing 
about your proposal? He was saying, tell your parents 
you don’t want to get married right now, you are young, you need to study. Is that all he said? Yes, so what else did he have to say? I mean, did he not say that he would send his family 
with a proposal for you? Have you gone mad? How is this possible? I have still not 
met anyone from his family, then where did the proposal come from? So, did he say that he will introduce you 
to his family? No, he said nothing like that. He didn’t say that, then 
he is not serious with you. Have you gone mad? 
How is he not serious? If he was not serious, he wouldn’t have 
come with me asking him once, and he would have told me to get 
married as per my family’s liking. But he didn’t say anything like that. In fact, he has said that tell your family that you don’t want 
to get married right now, you have to study. And I am thinking this is a good excuse
to coax mama and papa. This way, I will get a few days and I will also be able to 
meet Afnan’s family easily. Come to your senses Ramsha, 
you know mama… Annie. Annie. What is it? What are you two talking about 
secretly over here at this time? We were just talking, mama. Talk about what? 
You talk all day long. You are talking at this time too? Do you not run out of things to talk about? Don’t you have to sleep? Come on. Yes, mama. Bye. Bye, Ramsha. Come on. Hey aunt. Why are you standing like this, Afnan? I was waiting for Alizeh. By the way, why has she not come till now? It is really late. She comes back 
from the office by this time. But she came home a long time back. Really? Why did I not find out? 
Where is she? So, did she not meet you? 
No. She is in her room. Since she has come from the office,
she has locked herself in the room. I had thought that the office work 
must be a lot. I tried asking her but 
she didn’t answer me correctly. You ask her. Okay fine. You don’t worry, I will see. I am surprised, madam, I am looking for you all around the house 
and you are standing in a corner of your room. What happened? Hey, I am asking you something. 
What happened? I am listening. Hey, you are listening? 
You are in a bad mood? Nothing happened. Hey, how has nothing happened? Aunt was telling me that since 
you have come from the office, you are locked in your room. Something must have happened. I am asking you something. I am surprised. You are asking me? If I don’t ask you, 
then who would I ask? Hey, I don’t know about this. Okay, I will guess. Aunt said something? 
Did she scold you? No? if aunt didn’t scold you, 
then papa? But papa cannot say anything, 
he loves you a lot. So, who is left, then? 
Meaning, me. But madam, how can I even dare 
say anything in front of madam. Hmmm. You cannot say anything in front of me, but you can do everything. What do you mean? I…I…
Oh please, Afnan. Stop testing my patience. You have lied enough. How much more will you lie? When you were not in the office, then 
why did you tell me that you are in the office? No Alizeh, I was in the office…
Shut up. I saw you with that girl 
with my own eyes. Who was that girl, Afnan? Who was that girl?
Alizeh, listen… How can you do this with me?
Alizeh. Alizeh, listen… What do you want to say?
 Speak up. Okay, if you let me speak, 
then I will respond. Alizeh, you think wrong, 
there is nothing like you are thinking. I don’t want to talk to you. 
Move from here. Alizeh, please, I am telling you 
to trust me. What… I trusted you the most, 
and what did you do? You broke my trust. I am so disappointed with you, Afnan. Afnan, what is the matter? Why did Alizeh leave so angrily? I don’t know aunt. I don’t know what happened to her. Excuse me. My Tik Toks turned out to be great. Papa, mama, both of you are here? If you wanted something, 
then you should have called me. Why? Can we not come 
to our daughter’s room? I thought today we will go and 
talk to our daughter a lot. We don’t usually get time. It is good you came yourself. Because you are busy on the shop 
all day long, you don’t have time for me. Did you come home early today? Mehnaz, this is the same Ramsha, right? She grew up so quickly. I remember the day when a nurse had 
brought a doll and gave her in my arms and said that sir, 
you have had a daughter. And I had thanked God. That God, thank you for sending 
a blessing to our home. Hey, you ask me, who has tolerated her every single day. Your daughter has grown up with difficulty.
Do you see? Do you hear that? She tolerates me daily. It is good you heard it yourself today. No, no, child, your mother loves you a lot, 
she said it as a joke. I know that. Mama loves me the most. Yes, yes, Ramsha, the thing is that a 
proposal has come for you. I am tired of this aunt that 
bring proposals, papa. This proposal wasn’t brought by the aunt 
who gets proposals done, in fact, your aunt sent it. Aunt? Hey mama, you go and tell aunt, 
that if she wants to get someone married, then get Annie married. 
Why is everyone after me? Oh, come on, Ramsha. 
What nonsense is this? At least first ask us whose proposal 
she has brought. Yes, actually, your aunt has asked for 
your hand for Shani. What? Shani and I?
