[21.24] Tell me Alizeh, 
did you not tell everyone
[23.68] that they kidnapped me in front 
of you and took me?
[25.64] What is she saying?
[27.00] I don’t know what stories 
you are making.
[29.84] Alizeh,
[31.12] we were in the car, some people 
parked their car in front of you.
[35.04] Those people pulled me, dragged me, 
they kidnapped me in front of you.
[37.36] You were stopping them too.
[39.32] Did you not tell anyone anything?
[41.40] Why are you not telling anyone?
Please, don’t lie.
[49.20] I am saying the right thing.
[51.32] Something has happened to you, 
I don’t know why you are lying.
[58.12] Look girl,
[59.24] you are responsible for whatever
 you have done.
[81.24] Don’t even try to drag my daughter
 in this matter.
[98.24] In reality, because of 
your failed loves,
[101.40] you have become a mental patient.
[120.04] No need to do this drama 
in front of us.
[122.72] I am not doing a drama,
[125.08] you and your daughter are 
doing the drama.
[146.04] You two are lying.
[149.40] Are you not ashamed to say all this Alizeh?
[163.84] I am not making up stories, she is.
[166.84] Fine, let’s believe for a minute 
that you got kidnapped.
[180.88] Then the kidnappers let you go
 just like that?
[183.08] They didn’t demand money?
[200.12] What do you think we are mad here?
[202.04] We have lost our mind?
[213.08] Be quiet.
[223.24] Afnan,
[224.68] these two are lying.
[245.08] I was kidnapped in front of Alizeh, 
Afnan.
[252.80] She is lying.
[254.28] You believe me, why would I lie 
about all this?
[257.36] I was really kidnapped. Afnan,
[259.40] I was kidnapped in front of her eyes
[261.60] and I got away from them 
with difficulty.
[263.80] She is lying, believe me Afnan.
[266.44] Whatever she is saying is not true.
[268.48] Whatever I am saying Afnan is true.
[270.80] Be quiet.
[273.36] If you take my daughter’s name again,
[277.12] then I will cut your tongue.
[289.64] Cutting my tongue will not 
change the truth.
[293.48] The truth will remain what it is.
[316.92] What else can hypocrite and 
liar like you do?
[321.64] That’s it.
[323.80] You have said enough.
[327.52] They are not making up the story, 
you are.
[347.96] Like always you are telling us 
a false story.
[352.52] Ramsha.
[368.52] What was the need for you 
to do all this, Ramsha?
[381.60] That’s it, I have had enough. 
There is no place for you in this home.
[383.36] Get lost from here.
[385.32] Stop, Ramsha.
[549.96] I know well she went from here 
by her will.
[554.84] I had doubts on her earlier,
[557.20] She was busy on the phone for hours,
[559.84] I am sure she went with that boy.
[561.88] Afsheen, Ramsha is not such a girl 
and you keep on talking.
[566.84] I am sure she is in some difficulty
[569.24] and if you don’t want to support me, 
then don’t. I will go myself.
[571.20] Brother,
[574.44] why do you forget her past?
[577.24] If you tell the police her past, 
then they too will laugh at us.
[581.88] We will get defamed for no reason.
[584.20] Why do you forget brother
[585.88] that she ran away from her home 
like this as well.
[595.68] Look, God forbid, 
if Ramsha had an accident,
[600.08] then we would have gotten 
a call from the hospital.
[611.08] Or if she was kidnapped,
[616.08] then the kidnapper would have called
 for extortion.
[626.32] Now brother whatever the situation 
there is right now,
[630.08] it is clear from it that
[633.44] she went by her will.
[669.12] Do you also not believe me, uncle?
[680.72] Do you also feel that I am lying?
[695.88] Did I run away from this home
on purpose?
[699.24] Without caring about your respect?
[712.16] Do you too also consider me 
responsible like everyone else?
[722.48] Why are you quiet uncle?
 Answer me.
[733.64] If you feel that I am responsible 
then punish me.
[746.76] I can tolerate all punishment.
[758.52] But I cannot tolerate you
 being upset, uncle.
[770.40] I am unable to tolerate you 
being upset.
[780.24] I saw my parents, my home,
[785.44] my well-wisher, 
everything in you uncle.
[799.48] Uncle, you taught me how to live.
[802.76] You gave me a reason to live.
[813.76] I was walking on a dark path,
[817.56] you showed me light.
[832.44] Seeing you I have learned 
how to love God.
[836.04] You taught me how to love God, 
uncle.
[852.16] You have taught me what relation 
a person has with their Lord.
[859.28] I am not the Ramsha 
from earlier, uncle.
[861.60] I have changed.
[871.20] Believe me.
[875.64] I beg you, don’t look away from me.
[879.20] Forgive me. Believe me.
 Please…
[882.60] Ramsha,
[885.84] I believe you.
[887.72] I believe you more than myself.
[892.28] They are liar.
[895.68] Alizeh lied to me.
[899.64] Alizeh and Afsheen will fall so low, 
I couldn’t imagine it.
[906.40] They have done injustice to you.
[912.76] I called you my daughter
[916.56] and I couldn’t even take care of you.
[922.04] Uncle.
[923.12] Are you fine, uncle? Are you fine?
[926.76] Take me to my room.
[928.32] Come on, uncle. Come on.
[931.12] Come on. Careful, uncle.
[934.52] Afnan.
[937.16] Afnan.
[939.08] What happened?
[939.92] Uncle is really unwell, 
you please come quickly.
[942.48] What?
Yes.
[957.96] Where has this girl brought 
my brother to.
[972.76] Since this girl has come 
to my brother’s life,
[976.56] he has one foot in the hospital,
 one at home.
[988.84] I feel this girl is a bad omen.
[1000.20] First her father died, 
then her mother.
[1012.92] Now there is just a relation left 
in name
[1016.44] and she made it reach this point.
[1029.08] God give my brother life, 
give him health.
[1041.32] My brother is really respectful.
[1043.80] That is why he couldn’t tolerate 
the sorrow, the pain she gave him.
[1055.04] You know people are right,
[1058.76] you should keep the person
 in the place they deserve.
[1068.60] I made brother understand so much,
[1076.16] that this is not her place.
[1078.36] Don’t give her so much respect.
[1080.04] But no, who listens to me.
[1089.92] Alizeh never let brother’s head 
bow down.
[1094.64] She did as he said.
[1107.52] I was tired of making brother understand,
[1111.76] but no one listens to me.
[1189.12] Brother Bashir.
[1190.52] Yes, madam.
[1191.72] Tell the driver to take out the car, 
I have to go to the hospital.
[1194.28] Yes, better.
[1195.64] Alizeh, you are going to the hospital,
I will come with you.
[1199.44] Not at all.
[1201.12] Mama has clearly said that 
I don’t take you to the hospital.
[1203.84] Alizeh, I just have to meet uncle 
for two minutes.
[1206.84] I will meet him and just come back.
[1209.12] I have been calling Afnan for a long time,
even he is not answering my call.
[1213.44] That is really good.
[1220.48] Afnan didn’t pick up your call.
[1228.44] You know what this means?
[1230.68] That he doesn’t believe 
anything you say.
[1237.72] If you have even a little shame,
[1239.92] then don’t call Afnan after today.
[1242.96] Alizeh. Alizeh, please, 
take me along too.
[1290.40] Oh my God,
[1293.56] my Lord, I want to talk to You.
[1298.64] I have no one in this world 
apart from You.
[1305.12] No one is ready to listen to me.
[1309.36] You listen to me.
[1312.28] Oh God,
[1313.80] I have never complained to You,
[1317.44] I will not complain to you even today.
[1320.28] But I have just one support
 in this world, my uncle.
[1325.20] You give health to my uncle, 
make him better.
[1330.68] I want to meet him.
[1333.16] I want that he gets healthy 
and comes back home.
[1337.56] You give health to my uncle, my Lord.
[1341.28] Make him better.
[1382.40] What are you doing here?
[1385.84] I came to meet uncle.
[1387.68] Don’t take brother’s name.
[1396.36] You have no relation with him.
[1405.88] If you had a relation,
[1407.28] then you would have cared 
about that relation.
[1409.24] I will not let you meet him.
[1417.96] Didn’t you understand?
[1419.64] I will not let you meet my brother.
[1422.00] If you had a relation with him,
[1424.04] you would have cared 
for that relation.
[1426.28] But no,
[1427.60] you are the one who made 
brother unwell.
[1430.12] Because of you, today, 
brother is in this condition.
[1434.24] Don’t take his name from your tongue.
[1437.08] Let me meet uncle.
[1439.32] I will not leave without meeting him.
[1441.04] No. this is not our home, 
this is a hospital.
[1444.40] You didn’t care for our respect 
at home,
[1454.80] at least care for it in the hospital.
[1457.12] For the sake of brother, 
go from here.
[1466.20] Leave.
[1505.20] What is the point of sitting here,
 mama?
[1508.92] I would say let’s go home 
and rest for a while.
[1519.28] I am very sleepy.
[1522.00] Alizeh, what is wrong with you?
[1523.72] Brother is in such a serious condition.
[1526.08] So what?
[1527.88] Us sitting here won’t make him better.
[1538.60] I would say we would go home
[1540.48] and we will rest a little and 
if you want to pray for him,
[1542.68] you can do it from home too.
[1544.28] No Alizeh, Afnan is alone here.
[1553.00] If we go home, he will feel it,
[1555.16] he will not like it.
[1556.68] Mama, what difference does it make
if one person sits here or two.
[1560.00] Uncle won’t get better like this.
[1567.92] I would say we should take 
turns and rest,
[1570.36] so that all of us stay fresh,
[1573.88] and Afnan is here right now.
[1576.88] In fact, I will also make him understand
[1578.64] that we will come and 
stay one by one,
[1580.60] so that if uncle has an issue,
then all of us are available.
[1584.72] Or else if all of us sit like this, 
we will all get unwell,
[1591.76] and then we will come in the morning,
there will be no issue. Let’s go.
[1595.68] Yes,
[1597.28] you are right about that, 
even I am really tired, but…
[1600.48] Mama, that’s why I am saying 
we will go home.
[1602.40] You too will rest for a while 
and me too.
[1604.96] Okay fine, then I too will come along.
[1607.16] I will go right now and come 
early in the morning.
[1610.80] Okay, don’t worry, 
I will go inform Afnan, okay?
[1614.32] Okay.
[1640.64] Sir, please bring this medication 
from outside.
[1643.08] Sure.
[1643.88] Thank you. 
Thank you.
[1656.48] Ramsha.
[1659.44] You are still here?
[1664.24] I had told you,
[1666.48] I will not leave without seeing uncle.
[1668.88] What?
[1671.80] This means you are here 
since last night.
[1681.56] You didn’t go home?
[1691.44] After getting insulted so badly, 
you still didn’t go.
[1695.40] You are really stubborn.
[1698.28] When a person loves, 
they become stubborn.
[1710.68] In fact, you have to become stubborn.
[1719.24] Because when you love someone 
with a true heart,
[1732.28] then being stubborn is necessary 
because...
[1735.68] when someone breaks your heart,
[1743.96] then you can bear all that strongly.
[1746.44] So that you can tolerate it.
[1762.36] The condition my father is in today 
is because of you.
[1774.64] If you feel that like always 
saying these big things
[1779.96] you will melt my heart, 
then this will not happen.
[1787.00] I know,
[1788.96] you don’t have a heart in your chest, 
you have a stone.
[1799.16] And I am not interested 
in colliding with this stone.
[1809.12] Do you understand?
[1812.36] I understand.
[1815.28] I will tell the driver to drop you home.
[1816.76] You just said I am really stubborn,
[1823.44] so I will not go anywhere 
without seeing uncle.
[1932.84] You pray.
[1935.52] Pray with your heart,
God will accept it.
[1938.80] She is my sister, 
may God give her health.
[1948.32] Don’t worry.
[1950.72] Whenever your heart feels low,
[1953.32] call out to Him. 
He listens,
[1956.00] He knows it all. 
He lives in your heart.
[1962.64] Talk to Him about what is in your heart.
[1964.72] He listens. He listens to everyone.
[2054.20] Here you go.
[2056.32] Eat it.
[2062.16] A person gets angrier 
when they are hungry.
[2073.64] Afnan don’t think that I care for you 
or I worry for you,
[2075.80] that’s why I brought you food.
[2078.72] If you don’t eat, you will get unwell.
[2088.28] And right now, all of us cannot 
afford you being unwell.
[2100.80] Uncle needs you.
[2107.52] You being fine is necessary.
[2111.76] Thank you for telling me all this.
[2114.44] But you don’t need to worry 
about me at all.
[2119.20] I told you
[2121.16] I am not worried about you.
[2128.20] I just care for uncle.
[2137.84] That is why I am saying that
[2139.84] you take care of your health, 
because uncle needs you.
[2145.48] Here you go.
