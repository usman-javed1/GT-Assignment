[131.84] Oh God,
[134.84] my heart is really worried.
[140.16] Protect my daughter, my Lord.
[144.44] If she is in any trouble, 
then help her from the unknown.
[150.84] Keep my daughter in Your protection.
[154.88] God.
[156.16] God protect my daughter.
[225.88] Listen. Listen. Listen. 
Listen to me for a minute, please.
[229.72] I need your help.
[231.24] You please help me.
[232.72] Give me your phone for once,
 I have to make a call.
[236.52] I have to call them. 
They will help me, please, help me.
[239.08] Madam, what is your problem? 
You have raised hell all night long.
[242.68] Listen, listen, listen, look, the crime
 I have been trapped in, I didn’t commit it.
[247.36] I am not a criminal.
[248.64] I am not a criminal, 
you please just help me once.
[253.08] I have to call them from your number, 
they will come and help me.
[254.88] You please help me. 
Give me your phone once.
[257.48] I will call them in a minute 
and call them quickly,
[259.52] after that I won’t need any help from you.
[261.40] Hey, madam, sit there comfortably.
 Understand?
[263.84] If you make a lot of noise, 
I will complain to sir about you.
[266.52] No, listen to me.
[268.68] Have mercy on me.
 I beg you. Help me once.
[273.00] If you want, 
you can keep this gold ring.
[276.68] You can keep it. 
I will not tell anyone anything.
[278.72] You keep it forever. 
I will never take it back even.
[281.32] Just give me your phone once, 
I will just call them and ask them to come.
[284.84] You please, help me. 
Give me your phone for a minute, please.
[289.08] I am helping you seeing
 the helplessness in your eyes.
[293.12] Keep this with you,
it will come in use of you.
[298.00] Thank you. Thank you so much. 
I will quickly call in a minute.
[304.32] Be quick.
[305.24] One minute, let me dial the number…
[313.28] Afnan, answer my phone. 
Afnan, answer my phone, please.
[316.16] Madam, be quick.
[317.40] Yes, he is not answering the call.
 I will try again.
[320.24] Maybe he will answer now. 
He will answer the call.
[322.28] I will ask him to come quickly.
[324.20] Afnan, answer my phone. 
Please. Please Afnan, answer my phone.
[333.00] Madam, be quick. 
Give me my mobile. My job is on the line.
[361.60] Where were you till now?
[364.40] Do you have any realization?
[368.00] And where is your phone?
[370.24] I have called you a thousand times,
 you are not answering my phone.
[374.40] Do you even realize how worried we are?
[377.56] And you don’t care about your father at all, 
that how worried he would be for you.
[381.68] What is wrong, mama?
[383.56] I had told you and papa
 that I am going to the hospital.
[387.36] I didn’t go for an outing. 
You are scolding me so much.
[390.16] Really?
[391.60] If I don’t scold you, what do I do?
[393.12] You made a mistake and
 then you are making noise too.
[396.88] Hey, I feel, I shouldn’t have given you 
permission to go to the hospital.
[408.20] Hey, you ask me, 
who has tolerated her every single day.
[412.28] Your daughter has grown up with difficulty.
[414.28] Do you see that? Do you hear that?
[416.12] She tolerates me daily. 
It is good you heard it yourself today.
[419.12] Hey, no child, your mother 
really loves you. She is joking.
[423.24] I know that. Mama loves me the most.
[433.80] Is there someone to help me?
[436.88] Help me.
[440.80] Someone, help me.
[452.76] Hey girl, come here.
[455.28] Yes?
[456.24] Quickly call whoever you want to call 
before you got trapped in a big case.
[460.60] Thank you so much. 
Thank you. I will just call him.
[467.60] Thank you. 
Be quick.
[469.08] Yes. Yes.
[492.40] Hello.
[493.80] Hello.
[495.04] Afnan.
[496.20] Afnan, I have been 
calling you for so long.
[499.44] Ramsha?
[500.80] Whose number are you calling me from?
[550.48] Okay. Okay, bye.
[552.40] He is saying he is coming.
[554.60] Thank you so much.
[556.04] Thank you.
[558.68] God, thank you so much.
[560.92] Thank you, God.
[570.24] Thank you, God.
[578.76] What is this girl up to?
[583.12] Hello.
[584.40] Yes, Mr. Lawyer, 
you come to my office immediately.
[587.40] Fine, you reach my office immediately,
I am coming there.
[590.64] Okay. Okay.
[613.88] Yes?
[616.24] Yes, Mr. Lawyer, I was waiting for you.
[618.88] You please come to my room,
 it is an emergency. Thank you.
[630.88] Please. Please, come in.
[632.92] have a seat. Have a seat.
[634.80] Yes, Mr. Afnan, 
you called me so much urgency?
[638.08] All okay?
[639.76] The contract for your project is ready.
[645.60] I didn’t call you for this.
[648.64] Actually, there is a complicated matter,
[651.40] it is really confidential,
[653.88] so I want that it is solved properly.
[656.44] There is no problem that cannot be solved.
[658.68] You just tell me your case.
[663.76] Actually, it is a murder case.
[666.40] A murder case?
[669.88] Let me explain this to you.
[671.92] I have a friend, Ramsha.
[674.60] She came here with a friend of hers.
[677.28] That friend got murdered
 and she got blamed for it.
[680.96] But she has no fault in it.
[682.72] I have got the CCTV footage,
[685.08] it can be clearly seen it 
that some boy murdered her.
[689.48] But the issue is Ramsha is getting the blame
[693.24] and I want to take her 
out of this complication,
[695.88] so please look into it.
[699.40] It is a really complicated case.
[704.52] Whoever he is, I don’t care.
[707.20] I want that Ramsha doesn’t get an blame.
[710.24] She cannot handle this matter.
[712.36] Okay.
[713.68] I will prepare the papers of the bail, 
then we will see the case.
[716.80] Yes, there should be no negligence in this, 
and neither should this get leaked out.
[738.32] Fine.
[740.52] Go ahead with the case.
[742.56] I want it solved.
[757.56] Sister in law,
[759.76] are you worried about something?
 The food got burned.
[765.04] Salma,
[767.64] it is like worries are part of my fate.
[771.44] I couldn’t sleep all night.
[775.28] I am really worried.
[778.36] I was thinking about 
my daughter all night long.
[780.60] I don’t know what condition
 Ramsha would be in.
[782.16] Sister in law,
[784.88] just pray.
[787.72] We have not got any 
news of her for so many days.
[794.28] Salma,
[796.24] you tell Annie to ask someone.
[800.68] Find out about my daughter.
[802.88] If she knows someone, 
then call them, find out.
[808.80] Sister in law, that…
[809.88] Look
[811.28] Salma, I won’t ask anything.
[812.92] I won’t ask anything.
[815.28] Just tell her to find out, I should at least 
that wherever my daughter is, she is fine.
[821.88] I won’t ask anything.
[824.88] I won’t ask anything.
[826.52] Sister in law,
[828.20] she is smart, 
she can take care of herself.
[830.96] You don’t worry.
[833.16] Salma, she is not smart.
[836.76] If she was smart, 
then would she have done this? No, right?
[848.24] Okay,
[849.72] you don’t worry.
[851.76] See, be strong.
 I will talk to Annie.
[858.72] Come on. Come.
[902.88] Bring that girl.
[918.72] Hey girl,
[920.60] come on, 
you have been released on bail.
[923.60] Who got the bail done?
[924.92] How would I know who got it done?
[926.64] Come on, the SHO is calling you.
[930.00] Come on.
[930.80] Come on. Come with me.
[1100.56] What happened?
[1101.92] My friend, Hania.
[1104.16] Her boyfriend shot her in front of me, 
and she died on the spot.
[1108.44] You know, the police
 thought that it is my fault.
[1110.80] They put me in the lock up…
Quiet. Quiet.
[1113.60] Be quiet.
[1119.48] I am here.
[1121.40] Everything will be fine now.
[1124.16] What sort of a girl are you?
[1126.92] Even in this situation, you are talking.
[1130.12] You are talking.
[1132.72] Thank you, Afnan.
Thank you so much.
[1139.04] It is okay. You are welcome.
[1142.84] Thank you so much, sir. 
We will go now. Shall we go?
[1152.48] Yes. Listen to me…
[1155.24] Sit in the car, we will talk. 
I didn’t do anything.
[1199.68] Hania.
[1201.56] Hania. Hania, stop him. 
What is he doing? Hania.
[1205.32] Vicky.
[1206.16] Vicky.
[1206.88] Vicky.
[1207.80] Vicky.
[1213.40] Vicky, no.
[1214.96] Vicky, no.
[1216.12] Vicky, you won’t do anything like this.
 I am telling you.
[1231.96] Oh madam, you have
 a murder allegation on you.
[1234.64] You committed a murder.
[1237.84] Sir, I am speaking the truth, 
I didn’t do anything.
[1241.68] Her boyfriend, Vicky, 
he shot her in front of my eyes.
[1244.84] He killed her mercilessly,
 I am speaking the truth.
[1248.08] You have said the same thing ten times,
[1250.40] and do you know what personality you
 are putting such a big allegation on?
[1253.32] Yes, so I am speaking the truth, 
I am not lying. Believe me.
[1257.96] We know what we have to do.
[1260.76] We know our work better.
[1263.48] Take this girl out.
[1264.80] Sir, listen to me. If you call Vicky.
[1267.20] Come on, girl. Let sir do his work.
[1269.00] Then it will be better, sir.
 Instead you are punishing me.
[1288.68] Drink some water.
[1291.28] Drink it, you really need it right now.
[1293.12] In fact, I even got sandwiches for you.
[1295.76] In fact, lets do one thing, sit in the car,
 eat it, and then we will go.
[1303.52] I have no fault.
[1305.80] I didn’t murder her.
[1308.36] Hania’s boyfriend
 shot her in front of my eyes,
[1312.08] and the police put the entire blame on me.
[1317.04] I don’t know what I would have done, 
had you not come.
[1319.68] Those people would have done 
something really bad with me.
[1321.72] Ramsha.
[1323.92] How could I not come?
[1328.52] It was you.
[1330.56] I had to come for you at all cost.
[1336.36] And I know well that you didn’t do anything.
[1339.44] You are being framed in this matter.
[1344.44] But I am with you, Ramsha.
[1347.64] I will not leave you in this difficult time.
[1350.92] And we will get through this.
[1352.80] Come on, sit in the car, eat something.
[1354.96] I have to say something.
[1357.80] What do you want to say?
[1364.52] I had lied about everything to you.
[1370.32] Whatever I had told you, 
showed you, it was all a lie.
[1378.56] And you think whatever you 
had told me about you,
[1383.64] I had believed it all, right?
[1388.92] I knew you were lying.
[1392.64] Afnan…
[1398.68] You know,
[1401.12] Ramsha what is the best thing about you?
[1404.68] Your innocence.
[1407.68] You didn’t adopt the colours of the world.
[1410.44] So you believe whatever 
anyone says to you.
[1418.60] You see the world with your own eyes.
[1421.92] You feel that the way you think, 
the world is like that.
[1427.12] The eyes with which you
 look at the world,
[1431.00] the world operates the same way.
[1433.44] But there is nothing like that.
[1436.44] Here, everyone tries to 
take advantage of each other.
[1440.44] They use each other and then
throw them away like tissue paper.
[1445.24] But I am sure,
[1447.44] now that you have faltered a little, 
so you will learn.
[1451.60] And one more thing,
[1455.04] that I had felt about you, 
I will surely tell you that.
[1461.24] You have been running 
after materialistic things,
[1465.56] without thinking 
what would happen after you get it?
[1471.92] Trust me.
[1475.36] You get one thing once,
[1476.84] then you will get after another,
 and then another.
[1481.08] You tell me yourself.
[1482.80] Do you have peace in your life and heart?
[1534.68] Fine, okay, tell me if you talk to him.
[1538.16] Okay.
[1539.76] Alizay.
[1541.80] Alizay, child,
[1543.24] we have to go somewhere in the evening, 
so you dress up quickly.
[1549.04] Child, I am saying something to you.
[1551.12] I am listening mama.
[1553.16] Who are you calling again and again?
[1555.60] And you look worried to me too.
[1557.76] mama, I am calling Afnan, 
he is not answering my call.
[1562.32] So he must be busy, child.
[1564.24] What is there to worry in this?
[1566.00] That is what is worrying me,
[1567.88] that where is he busy that 
he is not even answering my call.
[1570.88] I messaged him in the morning, 
he hasn’t replied.
[1574.04] Mama, even if he is busy, he replies to me.
[1576.88] Where is he today?
[1579.56] Child, when he is with you,
you get annoyed.
[1582.80] When he goes far, you become restless.
[1586.72] What do you want?
[1588.68] Mama…
[1589.40] Child, he must be busy.
[1592.16] When he gets free, he will call you.
[1594.00] And be ready early, don’t get late.
[1606.60] No, no, Afnan, I cannot go home.
[1609.68] You don’t know my parents, 
they won’t let me go back to that home.
[1613.84] The doors of that home 
have been closed for me.
[1616.56] My father will never let me come, 
he is really short tempered.
[1619.96] He will not let me enter the home.
[1621.36] No, Ramsha, no. 
There is nothing like that.
[1624.00] Why are you being so negative?
[1626.96] Look, always remember one thing.
[1629.40] Our parents love us unconditionally
[1634.00] and they love us till their last breath, 
as much as they loved us on the first day.
[1638.44] They worry for us, they get worried for us,
[1641.44] that’s why they get upset at times.
[1643.00] But this doesn’t mean that 
we cannot go back home.
[1647.56] Every person makes a mistake, 
even you made one.
[1651.52] And you know what mistake we make?
[1654.80] We don’t knock on the door of the home.
[1660.28] We don’t even think that the homes 
we are going to without knocking,
[1665.28] the people who live there 
are waiting for us to knock.
[1671.24] You don’t know my papa,
[1673.92] that is why you are saying this.
[1676.32] He is really short tempered.
[1680.76] I don’t know your papa,
[1684.52] but I surely know that
[1687.84] if he makes you understand, 
then it is for your betterment.
[1693.76] Only because you don’t 
ever get stuck in a trouble.
[1701.56] And Ramsha, there are 
so many people in the world,
[1704.60] who have no one to love them
 or make them understand.
[1710.12] We are lucky, that our family 
worries for us, they want to guide us.
[1715.32] And remember, 
not everyone has this blessing.
[1723.08] Always remember, the garden 
that doesn’t have a gardener,
[1727.96] there fruit and flowers, both die out.
[1778.64] Did you talk to Afnan?
[1780.40] No. He was saying 
he will call me himself.
[1783.40] I am going to talk to brother 
and finalize a date,
[1786.16] and now you won’t say anything.
[1787.84] Fine, mama.
[1810.76] Afnan, I have decided.
[1813.00] I won’t go back to my home.
[1815.64] What is wrong with you?
[1817.32] Stop being stupid.
[1819.36] For God’s sake.
[1821.44] Don’t be stubborn for no reason.
[1823.28] Today, wherever you are it is
 cause of your stubbornness.
[1825.24] Go back to your home, quietly.
[1826.84] You can say what you want.
[1828.48] I know there is no place for me in that home.
[1830.40] I will not stay here…
[1831.20] Ramsha, what is wrong with you?
[1832.48] What is wrong with you?
[1834.12] What do you think of yourself?
[1836.08] And what do you think of others?
[1838.36] I have been standing here and 
trying to make you understand
[1840.32] that this place is not right for you,
you should go back to your home.
[1843.28] But you are being stubborn.
[1848.32] Ramsha,
[1850.52] don’t you remember 
the condition of your friend.
[1853.24] Whose stories you had told me.
[1856.56] What did that girl get?
[1858.72] The boy she went with for her love, 
what did she get?
[1862.48] Her life is ruined today and
 did something happen to that boy?
[1865.44] No.
[1867.96] This world is really selfish.
[1870.72] No one cares about anyone.
[1873.84] Today, if God forbid 
something happens to you.
[1876.72] All these people will just act like 
mere spectators, they will make your video,
[1879.48] take pictures and leave.
[1890.04] Listen to me.
[1892.56] If anyone is affected by something bad happening 
to us, then it is only our family. That’s it.
[1902.24] Please, go.
[1904.12] Please, Ramsha.
[1913.40] Fine.
[1959.76] Hello.
[1961.52] Where were you all day long today?
[1964.20] Man, I had told you, I am with a friend.
[1967.68] I don’t know how time passed,
[1970.60] and now I am going back home, 
and talking to you.
[1975.12] You were busy with a friend?
[1977.08] Yes, yes, I was with a friend.
[1979.12] The poor thing was in a difficulty, 
time passed trying to fix that problem.
[1983.72] And see, you and I didn’t talk all day long 
and even right now you are talking about them.
[1987.76] I am surprised.
[1990.52] You know, there is something.
[1992.36] You are no less than uncle.
[1995.12] You are in the forefront 
when it comes to doing charity.
[1998.04] Yes, obviously,
[1999.92] you will see the colours of blood.
[2002.28] After all, if the son doesn’t take up after the father,
then who would they take up after.
[2005.40] You know there is something, 
dad is right.
[2010.32] The peace and comfort you
 find in helping others,
[2014.60] it is nowhere else.
[2016.36] Okay, you must get it. 
How would I know?
[2018.92] Anyway, leave all this.
 Tell me, when are you coming back?
[2021.16] Hey, if you ask me, I will come today.
[2023.32] I will come when you ask me. 
Tell me, when should I come?
[2055.24] Who is it?
[2122.88] Ramsha.
[2124.16] Annie.
[2142.72] Who is it? Annie?
[2153.32] I will go inform elder papa.
[2159.08] What have you come here for?
[2161.84] What did you come to get?
[2164.48] Get out of here. Get lost.
[2167.24] Here you go.
[2171.60] Elder papa,
[2173.32] elder mama, that…
[2187.20] Ramsha has come back.
