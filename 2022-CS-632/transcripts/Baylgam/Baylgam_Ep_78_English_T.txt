[29.20] Did someone come to meet
you at the academy today?
[32.48] No, why?
[35.24] Yes, because
[37.08] I was thinking that your relatives
don’t come to meet you at home,
[41.20] so there is a possibility that
[42.08] any of your relatives came to
meet you at the academy.
[49.32] No one came to meet me Afnan.
[52.96] And I don’t have any relative
in this world now anyway,
[57.84] so someone’s presence
and absence
[59.52] doesn’t make any difference to me.
[67.16] What happened? Whose call was it?
[69.44] I don’t know someone is bothering me,
[70.40] I am getting calls from an
unknown number again and again.
[74.20] Okay,
[75.60] give it to me, I will talk.
[78.16] No Afnan,
[79.48] I will block it right now,
[80.68] there is no need to talk.
[93.80] Excuse me sir,
[94.80] these are some files,
[95.84] I need signs on them,
[96.92] Mr. Vaya needs to do
the meeting by today only.
[103.60] Excuse me, Sir?
[108.96] Sir? Afnan Sir?
[114.16] Sir, he is waiting,
[115.16] when should I call him
for the meeting?
[116.84] Hey dude, I don’t want
to do any meeting.
[121.36] Take this file away,
[122.36] why are you standing
on my head with it?
[123.96] Go and cancel my rest
of the meetings as well.
[129.08] Why are you looking at me like this now?
Can’t you hear me?
[131.24] Just get out of my office.
[134.08] Sir.
[153.88] Yes, I am talking about Ramsha,
[155.96] what were you talking to her about?
[157.96] Who are you to ask me that?
[160.08] She is a friend,
[162.56] it is up to me whatever I say to her.
[165.16] What?
[166.52] She is your friend?
She is your friend?
[168.04] She is more than a friend.
[174.84] Why should I tell you?
[181.36] Mind your own business.
[182.64] Do you understand?
[213.44] Ramsha?
[215.48] Greetings.
[216.76] Greetings.
[217.24] What are you doing here?
[218.88] Yes, actually there was
prediction of rain so
[220.96] I took an early off from the office,
[222.68] mom was telling me that
you are in the academy
[224.88] and driver is not available
so I thought of picking you up.
[227.48] Yes,
[228.36] looking at the weather
it seems like it will rain,
[230.72] it’s good, the weather
will become cooler.
[232.48] Yes, look there is prediction of rain.
[234.68] Thank God you came in time else
[236.20] I would have had to wait for you.
[237.80] Let’s go.
[238.40] Let’s go. Thank you.
[292.60] Ramsha?
[293.32] I, I, I won’t go, I won’t go.
[294.40] Come out.
[294.80] Leave me.
[295.32] Come out.
[295.80] Alizeh? Leave me.
[296.56] Ramsha?
[297.08] Alizeh?
[297.44] Hurry and come. Quickly.
[297.96] I will give you whatever you want
[299.40] but don’t take her.
[300.36] Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
[301.00] Ramsha?
[346.68] Say something Alizeh.
[350.24] Work is done.
[361.48] Your planning has been successful.
[364.24] My planning doesn’t get successful,
[367.28] that is impossible.
[375.68] I told you that
[377.48] you don’t have to take
Ramsha’s tension.
[380.52] You were absolutely right, mom.
[383.56] There wouldn’t be any use of
getting Ramsha out of this house,
[394.52] because she would have still
stayed in the hearts of this family
[406.64] but now, she will also
be out of this house
[408.96] and the hearts of this family.
[430.96] That is exactly what
is going to happen.
[441.96] You were tensed too Afsheen,
[446.16] I gave you support,
[448.84] kept you in this house
[449.88] and didn’t let you feel
deprived of anything,
[452.20] do you remember?
[453.68] Brother, I am your biological sister.
[458.04] Ramsha is my daughter.
[459.88] These so-called relationships
have no value.
[461.96] For me, they have value.
[520.64] You attacked Ramsha, right?
[524.56] I recognized your car.
[527.08] It was you, right?
[530.08] Yes,
[531.56] I was the one who attacked her
[535.76] but she has very good luck
that she got saved,
[541.36] it won’t happen next time,
I promise you.
[545.60] Alizeh,
[547.76] you want to kill her?
[549.96] Mom, if it was in my control,
[551.48] I would kill her right here right now
[554.16] because if she is alive,
[555.48] I and Afnan can never be happy.
[591.08] Ramsha?
[591.80] I, I, I won’t go, I won’t go.
[592.92] Come out.
Leave me.
[593.76] Come out.
[594.28] Alizeh? Leave me.
[595.08] Ramsha?
[595.76] Alizeh?
[596.32] I will give you whatever you want
[598.24] but don’t take her.
[598.96] Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.
[599.60] Ramsha?
[612.80] I cannot believe that
[615.20] brother compared me to Ramsha,
[620.36] the tone he spoke to me in,
[624.16] he never spoke to me like this,
[627.32] he is the same brother who
[629.68] would give his life for me.
[633.28] That is why I have been
so worried for so many days,
[636.52] this girl,
[638.32] this Ramsha has changed everything.
[643.96] She even changed brother,
[646.68] brother is not the same anymore.
[675.08] Yes, brother?
[675.68] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[677.16] Greetings.
Did Ramsha come back?
[679.08] No brother,
[680.28] Ramsha hasn’t come yet.
[682.20] Ramsha hasn’t come yet?
It has been so late,
[684.48] call and check with Jam-shed.
[686.12] Greetings.
[686.88] Greetings.
[687.96] Umm, brother Jamshed
[690.88] even went to the academy
[692.00] and we even called her,
[693.04] she is not attending
[693.76] and she is not even in the academy.
[700.36] If she not there then…
[701.40] Brother, she might have
gone to meet her aunt.
[704.36] Call and ask.
[706.32] Alizeh, dial their number.
[709.12] Umm yes, I will call.
[734.68] Umm,
[735.48] she is not picking up the call, Uncle.
[745.24] She even has a cousin,
[746.68] what is her name?
[747.56] Annie.
[747.92] Yes, Annie, Annie,
call on her number.
[749.28] I have her number, I will call.
[750.52] Call and let me know.
[776.88] Dad, she is not receiving the call.
[792.88] There might be network issue
as it is raining very heavily.
[801.12] May God keep things well,
[802.36] how is this possible?
[803.88] Afnan?
[804.80] Afnan? Where are you going?
[809.96] Don’t worry brother,
[811.60] she will come back in a while.
[812.64] You are telling me that
[813.24] she is not even in the academy
[814.16] and you are telling me
that I shouldn’t even worry,
[815.80] amazing!
[827.12] May God keep things well.
[844.40] Afnan, wait.
[845.48] Afnan, wait.
[846.96] Where are you going?
[848.16] To look for Ramsha.
[849.92] It is raining so heavily outside,
[851.64] how can you go
out in this weather?
[853.24] Hey, what is wrong with you?
[854.84] Ramsha has been
missing for so long
[856.08] and please get out of my way,
[857.20] I will find her at any cost.
[857.96] Afnan, at least listen to me.
[859.56] Afnan, listen to me.
[860.68] What is it?
[861.64] I won’t let you go out in this weather.
[863.56] Are you out of your mind?
[865.00] Why don’t you understand
what I am saying?
[866.68] Don’t come in my way now,
[868.20] I have to find Ramsha
under any circumstances
[869.76] because my heart and mind
[871.36] is not in my control right now.
[872.40] Please, don’t come in front of me.
[873.40] Afnan?
[885.24] Ramsha has put this mud, right?
[887.56] I saw it on her hands.
[891.12] No, no, you are getting it wrong,
[892.64] you have some sort of
misunderstanding.
[893.32] I am not getting anything wrong,
[895.80] I couldn’t even imagine that
[897.44] you can stoop so low.
[899.16] You guys have crossed
all the limits.
[901.24] What rubbish?
[902.92] It is no rubbish,
[904.44] I am telling the truth,
[906.12] you are spending time with that
pathetic woman leaving your wife behind?
[909.12] Shut up. Just shut up.
[913.92] If you say another
disgusting word after this,
[918.08] I won’t spend a moment
after that with you.
[938.96] Mom, brother Afnan is here.
[942.40] Afnan, here at our home?
[944.80] Yes, I have seated him.
[945.48] Make him sit.
[946.12] I made him sit, come.
[948.12] Let’s go.
[958.24] Greetings.
[959.12] Greetings, son, Afnan, you here?
[962.20] At this time? Is everything well?
[964.08] Actually…
[965.12] I, I will go make tea.
[966.68] Go.
[968.44] Aunt, Actually I wanted to ask that
[970.88] Ramsha has gone to the
academy since morning,
[972.52] she hasn’t come home yet.
[980.76] Did she come here?
[984.20] No, son, she didn’t come here.
[994.84] Had she come here,
[996.32] I would have called you
and told you myself.
[1004.64] Do one thing,
[1006.12] call and ask her yourself.
[1008.20] Yes, I have tried calling her
multiple times since morning
[1011.28] but her number is switched off.
[1021.04] I don’t know where did she go.
[1022.88] She ran away with her lover.
[1024.84] You shut up.
[1033.92] By the way I am surprised
[1035.04] and a bit sad for you as well,
[1045.56] about the fact that I thought
[1048.52] you are her only lover,
[1056.40] but there are more here.
[1058.24] Shut up!
[1066.68] I’ll pull your tongue if you say one bad
word about Ramsha’s character.
[1072.04] And you think
I am wearing bangles here?
[1078.08] I won’t do anything in return?
[1079.08] Hey?
[1079.40] Yeah?
[1080.56] For God’s sake, quiet,
[1081.56] go away from here, Shani, go.
[1087.72] Ask him to leave from here.
[1089.40] Shut up,
[1090.40] I am asking you to leave,
[1091.92] go away from here.
[1094.00] Go.
[1107.88] Son, you know
[1111.36] Shani’s temperament,
[1113.48] he gets angry very quickly
[1114.80] so you should have been very careful,
[1125.20] this is not a battlefield but my home.
[1132.80] Yes, you are right,
[1135.00] I am sorry.
[1219.64] Where am I?
[1222.76] Is anyone here?
[1225.12] Is anyone here?
[1227.96] Is anyone here?
[1230.88] Is anyone here?
[1232.88] Is anyone here?
[1234.88] Where have you brought me?
Who are you guys?
[1239.00] Is anyone here?
[1240.56] Can you hear me?
[1241.92] Get me out of here.
[1248.28] Where am I?
[1249.32] Can anyone hear me?
[1251.80] Why is no one listening to me?
[1254.32] Is anyone here? To help me?
[1260.08] Is anyone here to help me?
[1264.20] Can anyone hear me?
[1265.84] If someone can hear
me open the door,
[1267.56] someone help me.
Is anyone here?
[1274.60] Oh God,
[1276.72] no one is listening to me,
[1278.00] I don’t know what they
will take from me.
[1280.68] Why is no one listening to me?
[1282.64] can anyone hear me?
[1336.68] Is anyone here?
[1338.76] Is anyone here?
[1340.20] Is anyone here to help me or not?
[1343.80] Why have you brought me here?
[1348.52] Is anyone here to help me?
[1353.60] Is anyone here?
[1354.52] Is there anyone outside,
can anyone hear me?
[1356.76] Can anyone listen to my voice?
[1359.32] Why have you kept me here?
[1362.80] Get me out of here.
[1367.80] Get me out of here.
[1514.24] How can Ramsha go
anywhere without informing?
[1517.84] She is a responsible girl,
[1519.16] she is not careless.
[1520.64] This is not possible,
[1522.32] she is definitely in some trouble,
[1524.84] or difficulty and
[1525.88] my heart is sinking thinking about it.
[1528.20] Hey brother, please control yourself.
[1536.24] Alizeh has just called all
her academy friends
[1541.16] but there is no clue about
Ramsha anywhere.
[1550.84] Don’t worry,
[1552.32] Afnan will come some news
with him by the grace of God.
[1558.04] What did you say
[1559.24] that Afnan will come with
some information?
[1566.64] Why don’t you say that
[1567.76] he will bring Ramsha along,
by God’s will?
[1576.76] Afsheen?
[1578.56] Do you know something? Tell me?
[1582.52] I? What will I know, brother?
[1585.68] I am already so worried for her.
[1588.72] Look Afnan has called now.
[1592.84] Hello, Afnan?
[1603.88] Any information about Ramsha?
[1607.76] Okay fine.
[1611.88] No brother,
[1613.92] no information about
Ramsha anywhere.
[1615.56] Okay, then we must go to the
police and file a complaint.
[1617.76] Hey brother,
[1619.52] there is no need.
[1625.48] There is no use of
complaining to the police.
[1637.12] I, I know it very well that
[1640.16] she has left by her own
choice from here.
[1645.88] I had doubts on her already,
[1651.36] the way she used to be
on call for hours,
[1653.84] I am sure she left with that guy.
[1656.00] Afsheen, Ramsha is
not that kind of girl,
[1658.56] and what do you just keep on saying?
[1666.76] I am sure she is in some trouble
[1668.68] and if you don’t want to help me,
[1669.84] then don’t, I will go myself.
[1671.32] Brother,
[1674.36] why do you forget her past?
[1684.12] If you will tell her past to the police,
[1686.60] they will also laugh at us.
[1699.24] We will be defamed for no reason.
[1707.16] Why do you forget brother,
[1708.76] she ran away from
her house the same way?
[1718.48] How can you jeopardize the honor
of your home for a stranger girl?
[1722.52] Quiet Afsheen!!
[1724.64] She is not some stranger.
[1731.80] And why don’t you forget her past?
[1739.76] God forgives but human beings don’t.
[1750.80] And I haven’t just called
her my daughter,
[1754.44] I have also accepted her
as my daughter.
[1766.24] And a father never leaves his
daughter alone in hard times.
[1776.12] Jamshed, take out the car.
[1778.00] Br.. brother…
[1778.92] Jamshed?
[1812.48] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[1814.08] Greetings.
[1815.16] I wanted to file a report.
[1816.56] Go there in front.
[1818.48] Okay.
[1837.08] Mr. Constable,
[1838.56] Mr. Constable.
[1839.72] What is it?
[1842.08] What is your problem, uncle?
[1845.56] You scared me.
[1848.72] You don’t even let us
sleep in peace.
[1854.88] I guess you are forgetting
you are in duty.
[1857.44] Yes, I know I am at the duty.
[1860.00] I am a human being,
we can fall asleep.
[1868.80] Uncle, I am at the duty
[1870.20] that is why I am present here
[1871.56] else I would have gone home
and slept peacefully.
[1879.04] Why are you standing quietly?
[1880.20] Now tell me what is the work?
[1881.72] People can’t sit at home
in peace even in this weather.
[1887.04] I want to file a report.
[1889.68] Want to file a report.
[1895.08] Who kept this here?
[1898.24] They don’t even leave my pen.
[1900.28] Whoever wants,
[1901.40] they take pen from my table.
[1910.28] Areeb? Areeb? Get up.
[1917.44] Go and get piping hot tea from me ...
[1919.56] ...from the Pathan hotel
that is open outside.
[1923.44] He already ruined my sleep
[1924.64] and woke me up half asleep.
[1926.60] Pen, for the report.
[1931.64] Now why are you standing
on my head?
[1933.00] Sit down.
[1942.64] I am already sleepy.
[1944.44] Okay, Uncle, sit down,
[1945.76] I will wash my face
and come back,
[1947.96] if I keep on sitting,
I will be yawning from sleep.
[1952.16] They just come.
[1961.96] There is no use of
complaining to the police.
[1966.12] I, I know it very well that
[1968.32] she has left by her own
choice from here.
[1974.80] I had doubts on her already,
[1980.20] the way she used to be on call for hours,
[1982.72] I am sure she left with that guy.
[1986.72] Why do you forget her past?
[1994.48] If you will tell her past to the police,
[1996.96] they will also laugh at us.
[1998.60] We will be defamed for no reason.
[2001.00] Why do you forget brother,
[2002.60] she ran away from her house
the same way?
[2013.76] Look my child, 
I promised your late Mother,
[2019.28] may God forgive her, that
[2021.88] you are my responsibility,
[2024.92] I wanted to keep you in my home and
[2027.64] marry you from here 
like my daughter,
[2036.68] but I guess there is something 
else in the fate.
[2042.04] I think that
[2044.64] it is better for this house
 if you leave from here.
[2095.80] You are Mr. Qasim, right?
[2101.00] Yes, greetings,
 may peace be upon you.
[2104.36] I didn’t recognize you.
[2108.12] I offer prayers in the same mosque,
[2111.36] I have heard you speak 
about religion often there,
[2118.24] you speak really well,
 by the grace of God.
[2120.92] Thank you, 
Thank you so much.
[2123.20] May I know why have
 you come here?
[2126.00] Did you have some work?
[2128.92] Yes, I wanted to file a report.
[2131.88] So are you done filing it?
[2134.96] Umm your officer has 
gone to wash the face.
[2141.04] What do you mean?
[2142.48] He has just woken
 up from sleep,
[2144.12] he will just get freshen up
[2145.04] and come write 
the report then.
[2149.20] Greetings, Sir, 
you here at this time?
[2151.68] Do you come here 
to sleep or do your duty?
[2163.20] Sorry Sir.
[2165.68] To hell with your sorry,
[2167.44] if I ever hear that you 
are sleeping again,
[2170.60] I will suspend you, 
do you understand?
[2183.72] You file the report
[2185.80] and then meet me before leaving,
[2188.08] Okay, thank you.
[2195.16] Uncle, you complained about me,
[2198.20] you shouldn’t do that.
[2206.16] Mom, what will happen now?
[2209.36] What if Uncle finds out 
we are behind all this, then?
[2213.44] Alizeh, please,
[2215.00] for God’s sake don’t
 say such things.
[2227.64] I am already getting 
a very bad vibe.
[2230.04] He wouldn’t find anything.
[2232.60] I guess you are forgetting,
[2234.24] Uncle has gone to the 
police station to file a complaint right now.
[2237.80] So what?
[2242.16] And brother has gone to 
the police station for formality, that is it.
[2251.20] Mom?
[2253.04] Now what?
[2255.32] But what if police actually
