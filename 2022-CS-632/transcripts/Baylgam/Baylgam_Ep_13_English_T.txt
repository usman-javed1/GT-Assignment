[20.16] I mean,
[21.48] I am studying right now 
I will have my final year exams.
[25.48] Because of that I don’t want to get married,
[29.08] so that my education doesn’t get disturbed.
[34.28] Child, this sounds good coming 
from a person
[36.72] whose entire attention is on studies.
[42.96] But your attention is towards
something else.
[50.36] Do I not know?
[64.04] Anyway, I have told your mother to find
 a good proposal, and finalize things.
[68.80] And fix the wedding date for 
after your exams.
[73.08] Papa, you don’t understand…
[74.96] Ramsha, now it is your turn
 to understand.
[81.88] You said no to marrying Shani,
[85.16] me and your mother agreed.
[91.00] We didn’t argue, 
nor were we strict with you.
[95.32] We have always given importance 
to your happiness,
[101.80] so now being a good daughter,
[104.40] it is also your responsibility
[107.32] to keep the words of your parents.
[115.68] Go,
[117.44] prepare your exams. Come on.
[153.68] That’s the thing.
[154.96] I don’t understand myself 
what I should do now.
[159.88] Ramsha,
[161.76] now you have to decide this.
[164.96] Do you want to spend your life like this
[168.12] or do you want to change your life.
[170.76] Look, if you keep on rejecting 
such good offers
[174.88] then you will not be able to get 
anything you want in life.
[178.88] You are right.
[181.48] Hania, what do I do? 
I want to get out of all this,
[185.44] but no one at home will support me. 
I know that.
[190.48] You tell me, what do I do now?
[193.04] You do one thing, go to Islamabad.
[195.76] Danish Kamal has a big 
production house there,
[198.64] he will give you work along
with accommodation.
[202.16] Islamabad?
[204.60] So far?
[205.88] How will I go alone?
[207.92] Yes, so,
[209.44] Islamabad is not that far.
[211.36] People go to a different country 
to make their career
[214.48] and you are worried about 
going to Islamabad?
[217.28] I am not worried.
[220.16] I know that the family wont let me go.
[224.08] Then your acting is done.
[225.84] You will have to go to a different country
 for the shoot,
[228.28] what will you do, then?
[230.04] Yes, you are right about that.
[232.44] You have to go abroad for shoots too.
[236.00] And my papa?
[237.44] He never took me out of Karachi, 
how will he let me go out of the country?
[241.40] Ramsha, it is your decision now,
[244.12] do you want to live your life 
with these regrets
[247.96] or do you want to fulfill these dreams?
[251.00] It is up to you.
[275.88] Annie, child, please prepare tea.
[278.76] Sure.
[279.88] and you, Ramsha, wash the dishes.
[283.64] Me?
[285.64] Yes, if not you then who else?
[289.28] Sister in law, congratulations to you.
[292.36] Congratulations?
[293.68] Salma, congratulations for what?
[295.84] Hey, I forgot to tell you.
[298.92] The woman who had come 
to meet Ramsha,
[301.76] she likes Ramsha for her son.
[315.40] And now she wants the girl 
to meet her son,
[317.52] so you can call her 
when you have time.
[330.52] That is fine, Salma,
[332.68] but first let me talk to Ramsha’s father,
[335.84] then I will call them.
[338.40] Do what you see is fit.
[342.72] Our Ramsha, is so pretty, 
they had to say yes.
[351.88] Salma,
[354.40] thank you very much,
[356.76] you made so much effort for 
my daughter’s proposal.
[359.64] May God bless you for it.
[363.92] Sister in law, what are you saying?
[369.16] Ramsha is my daughter too
[373.56] and we want that our daughters go
to their home as soon as possible.
[378.20] Amen.
[393.88] You are having a lot of fun, right?
[395.76] Hello.
[397.20] I could see clearly how much 
you were smiling.
[401.40] I was only praising you, 
what is wrong in that I said?
[404.56] Annie, don’t act naïve.
[406.80] You know well that I like Afnan 
and I want to marry him
[410.68] and you are adding salt 
to my wounds.
[416.56] If you really love, Afnan,
[418.88] then tell him everything 
about you honestly.
[423.24] Tell him to bring a proposal 
for you here.
[426.72] Have you gone mad?
[429.32] Have you seen Afnan?
[431.24] The status he has.
[433.64] Not just him, no one from his family
 would want to come here.
[437.56] I will tell Afnan the truth
[440.68] when I too have a home 
as big as Afnan,
[443.68] a big car, money,
[447.12] fame, all everything.
[451.20] That’s when I will tell Afnan, so that
[453.52] he or his family has no problems 
coming here.
[456.12] Because you get married 
in your equals, right?
[459.20] Proposals don’t get finalized like this.
[463.92] Anyway, believe me, Annie,
[466.72] all this will happen soon.
[469.44] How do you see such big dreams, 
Ramsha?
[471.88] What do you think?
[473.20] Earning money is so easy 
that a person goes out,
[475.68] breaks the money from the trees
and becomes rich.
[477.80] Hey my love,
[480.60] think something like this is going 
to happen now.
[483.28] Ramsha,
[484.92] tell me honestly, what is going on
 in your head.
[487.80] Hell no.
[488.96] You think I am mad that 
I tell you my plans?
[492.24] After all, whenever I have told you,
all your plans have gotten ruined.
[496.68] You mean to say that 
in all your plans…
[499.08] There is nothing like that. 
After all,
[501.16] don’t put so burden your small brain 
so much.
[504.00] You care for me so much, 
you really sympathize with me, right?
[506.48] Then do one thing, 
wash all the dishes.
[511.28] I am not washing the dishes.
[513.32] I will just make tea, 
you will wash the dishes.
[515.24] Look child, you will wash the dishes.
[517.40] Come on, pick up all the things, 
and go wash the dishes.
[520.40] Bring green tea to my room.
[525.20] Bring green tea to my room.
[530.56] The boy’s name is Nabeel
[533.32] and sister Asma was saying, 
they are a good family,
[536.88] they are well educated family 
and they are also affluent.
[540.44] They have a big shoe factory
[542.64] and they also have three to four shops.
[546.80] The wedding planner was telling me,
[550.04] he has two sisters, both are married.
[552.60] One is in Dubai and the other in Muscat.
[555.12] The way she has praised them, it feels that
[558.04] they are good and sober people.
[561.12] What do you say, Anwar?
[567.92] Brother, I feel this proposal is suitable
from all angles.
[571.76] I would say go ahead.
[578.68] Fine, then,
[580.68] tell those people to come over,
[583.08] and yes bring the boy along.
[587.16] If the matters are fine,
[589.96] then we shouldn’t delay 
in Ramsha’s wedding.
[594.68] Salma, let me talk to Nabeel’s mother.
[598.24] I will just get you talk to him.
[600.76] You get me tea.
[602.28] Yes, yes, I will just bring it.
[606.48] God will make it all fine.
[615.44] Ramsha.
[617.56] Ramsha.
[621.32] Ramsha? What is this?
[623.44] You have not changed? 
Those people are here,
[625.28] come on, quickly change…
[626.76] Mama, listen to me once. Please…
I have had enough.
[630.80] I will not hear you say no 
from you at any cost.
[634.04] You are aware of your father’s anger well.
[636.44] Come on, change quickly and come.
[638.80] Don’t take long.
[640.40] I am coming.
[642.84] They do what they want.
[644.36] I am telling them, 
I don’t want to get married.
[645.92] I don’t want to get married, 
no one understands me.
[648.76] Nabeel’s father didn’t come 
with us today,
[651.12] I apologize for that.
[652.88] He had to go to Hyderabad 
for something important.
[656.04] We have an office in Hyderabad too.
[658.04] But as soon as he comes back 
from there,
[660.48] he will surely come to meet you people.
[663.04] No issues. This is his own home,
[665.96] he can come when he wants.
[667.80] What is there to apologize in this?
[670.72] Nabeel, son, have something.
[673.96] Thank you, aunty.
[675.60] I was in the office a little while back, 
so I ate from there and came.
[680.12] Hey, I had told my son
 to take the day off,
[683.04] but he takes up after his father.
[684.96] They only takes off on Eids, 
other than that they have no other offs.
[689.84] That’s how businesses work.
[691.92] We have the same setting.
[693.76] If I am busy, Anwar takes care of things.
[696.64] If Anwar is busy, 
I take care of everything.
[699.04] Even we don’t close the shop.
[704.24] Uncle, you know,
[705.76] you have to give time to business.
[710.12] Absolutely right.
[711.72] Okay tell me, what other hobbies 
do you have other than the business?
[715.12] Nothing special.
[717.76] I get free from the office, 
so I sit with friends.
[720.68] And I don’t have a lot of friends anyway.
[727.00] Hey, you know of the environment 
nowadays.
[729.36] I don’t let my children go to the neighbourhood
or friends a lot.
[732.88] Straight to the office from home, 
and home from the office.
[735.04] That’s how life is.
[736.20] That is really good.
[738.56] Brother, have a samosa.
[740.88] You have some. 
Yes, okay then.
[744.28] Hey, Mehnaz, you call Ramsha.
[747.76] At least what we came for, 
at least that should be fulfilled.
[750.40] Yes, yes, Salma must be bringing her.
[754.16] Hey, she is here. 
She is here.
[757.04] Come on, sit.
[758.56] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[761.16] Ramsha is really pretty.
[787.80] Your daughter is really pretty.
[818.40] Hello.
[820.20] Yes, were you calling me?
[821.88] Yes, I was calling you.
[823.64] But like always you were busy, 
you didn’t answer my call.
[827.56] Hey, what do I do?
[829.08] I am really busy cause of the new branch
[831.68] and then I had to buy tickets too. 
You tell me, what happened?
[836.08] Tickets? Why?
[837.76] Are you going somewhere?
[839.60] I am going to Islamabad.
[842.80] Islamabad?
[844.56] You know I too am going to Islamabad.
[847.44] I have a shoot there.
[849.24] Really?
[850.64] and the two of us are meeting 
in Islamabad, right?
[854.16] Listen, I am going for work.
[857.32] Yes, so I too am going for work.
[859.88] There is a huge difference 
between our work.
[863.76] Afnan, work is work
[867.20] and I have noticed this.
[868.76] You always consider my work 
and me small.
[872.56] No, I didn’t mean to say that. 
Don’t misunderstand me.
[875.96] Okay fine,
[877.64] let me check my schedule 
then I will tell you
[879.96] if we will be able to meet
in Islamabad or not.
[882.40] Mr. Afnan, no matter how 
your schedule is,
[885.24] you are meeting me in Islamabad.
[887.16] And yes, your responsibility is that
[889.60] you have to take me around,
 Islamabad, okay?
[892.80] man, you too at times talk like a child.
[895.56] Okay fine, we will meet.
[926.68] Oh wow, where did we get 
so many sweets from?
[929.60] From your in-laws.
[931.08] From my in-laws?
[934.00] It came from brother Nabeel’s home.
[935.84] You made him your brother, so soon?
[937.80] I will teach you a lesson.
[939.32] Decent girls call their 
brother in law their brother.
[942.80] Really?
[945.48] Oh my throat.
[947.88] You too eat it. 
You have it.
[950.24] Why are you asking me questions?
[951.32] Ask all your questions from mama
and elder mama,
[952.92] who have accepted these sweets.
[954.40] I will question them well, 
you eat this entire sweet!
[974.44] God knows who that girl was.
[978.76] No, I didn’t see her face.
[982.60] Okay tell me,
[984.92] should I be worried cause of that girl?
[993.40] Okay thank God,
[995.48] at least you comforted me. I liked it.
[999.80] Okay fine, Okay Mazhar, goodbye.
[1010.80] I shouldn’t sit so satisfied.
[1024.56] Here you go, tea.
[1030.96] I was thinking that
[1032.92] you and Anwar should have 
investigated a little more.
[1036.68] Hey, why do we fix the proposal 
in so much haste.
[1039.96] Nowadays, anyway, there are 
a lot of frauds in proposals.
[1043.00] My heart is worried thinking that.
[1047.28] Hey no need to be worried or scared.
[1051.72] Me and Anwar have investigated well.
[1055.76] I find them to be a good 
and decent family.
[1058.80] They are living in the neighbourhood 
for twenty five years.
[1061.20] In fact, I even met Nabeel’s father.
[1066.16] He seemed like a decent man to me.
[1071.64] I would say that you give them 
the date for the function.
[1080.80] Okay,
[1082.76] fine, as you wish.
[1088.84] In fact, do one thing, tell them
[1092.44] to bring some close relatives on Sunday
and do the ceremony with simplicity.
[1104.48] What is wrong, Sajid?
[1105.88] How will I make all this preparation 
so quickly.
[1108.60] You don’t have to make preparations 
right now, we will prepare on the wedding.
[1111.96] Hey, me and Anwar, will make arrangements
for food for a few people.
[1120.92] When the proposal get fixed,
[1123.84] I too will be satisfied.
[1161.76] Hello.
[1164.28] Yes, this is Ramsha.
[1167.40] Can I talk to Danish Kamal?
[1195.56] Hey Ramsha, what is wrong?
[1197.92] What are you thinking about? 
I have to prepare food.
[1200.16] You still haven’t chopped the vegetables.
[1202.00] I am chopping it, mama. 
Calm down…
[1203.80] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1205.48] The food is still not ready?
I am preparing it shortly.
[1209.52] Okay.
[1211.36] Yes, Mehnaz,
[1214.20] this is one hundred thousand,
we need to give it to Adil.
[1216.24] Keep it safe. Okay?
[1247.16] Brother.
[1249.44] Oh, sweets.
[1254.64] Who brought it? 
Papa or elder papa?
[1258.24] It came from Ramsha’s in-laws.
[1267.56] A few days they were talking 
about Ramsha’s proposal.
[1270.84] They said yes, 
so they sent sweets.
[1275.20] It is not good at all. 
It is really bad.
[1280.20] You didn’t like the sweets 
or did you not like it that
[1283.28] Ramsha’s proposal got fixed?
[1286.28] Have you not started talking a lot?
[1288.80] I feel you are spending 
a lot of time with her.
[1291.48] The girls who talk like this, 
I want to cut their tongue.
[1295.96] Come on, go from here.
[1298.20] Leave.
[1301.52] She talks too much.
[1322.00] tell me, what is bad in this proposal?
[1325.04] There is nothing good in this proposal 
either, mama.
[1327.28] You think yourself when my friends 
ask me what does my husband do?
[1330.08] What will I say? Shoe business.
[1333.16] Oh God, since my father didn’t find
any other proposal.
[1337.12] Listen, they don’t run a shoe business.
[1339.92] In fact, they have a big factory of shoes.
[1343.96] And you know?
[1345.08] The family is really good, 
they have a big family.
[1347.88] What is wrong with you mama?
[1349.68] No matter how good this proposal is,
I don’t want to get married here.
[1354.24] No one is taking your advice
[1357.00] and neither are you being told.
[1359.56] Your father has said that those people
are coming to complete the ceremony on Sunday
[1363.00] and I am going to go do 
your shopping tomorrow.
[1365.32] If you want to come along with me, 
then come or I will shop by my liking.
[1371.12] Aunt did all this, right?
[1373.32] Tell her, if the proposal is so good,
then get her daughter married.
[1376.60] Why are you people using me 
as a scapegoat?
[1379.28] Fear God.
[1380.80] And stop being thankless.
[1383.44] She did a favour on us, 
with her daughter being there,
[1386.84] she cared about you.
[1388.40] Instead of being thankful to her,
you are being thankless.
[1391.28] Fear God.
[1392.56] God put some sense in this girl.
[1395.72] Mama, this is the limit. The limit!
[1577.36] Who is it?
Open up.
[1583.60] What happened aunt?
[1585.48] Why did you lock the door
 from inside?
[1588.56] The boys in the street 
they were screaming so much,
[1593.44] so I closed the door to sleep.
[1595.56] These children make noise daily.
[1598.72] What is wrong aunt?
[1600.20] I closed the door to sleep 
so what hell broke loose?
[1603.36] Okay sister in law is calling you
for so long.
[1607.76] What if mama saw me 
leaving her room?
[1611.20] Or she opened her cupboard and 
saw that there is no money there?
[1619.04] What will happen now?
[1623.44] Why is she calling me?
[1624.92] Sister in law asked you to bring 
clothes from the roof,
[1627.68] why did you not bring them till now?
[1630.16] Yes, I had forgotten to bring the clothes,
[1634.04] I will bring them in two minutes.
[1635.44] Bring them quickly,
[1636.52] if the clothes remain in the sun for too long,
then they will lose their colour.
[1643.08] I will make you people lose 
your colour now.
[1646.80] Really soon…
Ramsha!
[1648.56] I am coming.
[1797.72] Greetings.
[1798.60] Greetings. 
I wanted to meet Mr. Qasim.
[1801.48] Mr. Qasim?
[1802.68] Okay fine. Come, 
he is sitting in the lawn.
[1804.64] Okay. 
Come on.
[1821.88] Greetings, Mr. Qasim.
[1824.00] Greetings.
[1826.92] I apologize, I didn’t recognize you.
[1829.96] My name is Sajid.
[1832.08] Mr. Usman must have spoken to you 
about me.
[1834.76] We have a wholesale shop of grocery.
[1837.36] Yes, yes, I spoke to brother Usman.
[1840.28] Afnan, son arrange tea. 
Yes.
[1843.52] Yes, brother Usman…
you have a seat…
[1847.72] No, I am fine. 
Hey, come on. Sit.
[1851.56] Thank you.
[1852.96] I was talking to brother Usman 
in this regards,
[1855.76] he mentioned both you brothers.
[1857.96] He said that you two are really honest 
and the products you have are really good too.
[1863.56] It is all God’s blessing Mr. Qasim.
[1865.36] We try to work well and the customer
has no complaint,
[1870.44] and even Mr. Usman gives us all the list.
[1873.96] We make his packet and deliver it to him.
[1877.56] Till now he has no complaints 
from us till today.
[1880.08] That’s good,
[1881.88] every Muslim should be true 
to their promise and word.
[1885.76] Have tea. 
Thank you very much.
[1889.60] Mr. Sajid we will require one hundred to 
one fifty packets of grocery every month.
[1896.88] It will be done.
[1899.28] If you give us the address of the people 
you want it delivered to,
[1902.64] we will deliver it.
[1904.16] We have our own suzukis.
[1905.72] That is really good.
[1907.32] Meaning, if you can do this too, 
we will not have this responsibility.
[1911.32] It will be easy for us.
[1912.84] Afnan, the people we send the groceries
to give their addresses
[1919.56] along with the grocery list to Mr. Sajid.
[1923.36] Mr. Sajid, this is my son, Afnan.
[1926.80] I just met him.
[1928.64] So, whatever matters 
there are there with you,
[1930.48] he will deal with them, and he will 
also resolve the payment issues,
[1933.72] if there are any.
[1935.96] I just want to say to you that
[1938.20] if the quality seems good and 
the price is reasonable,
[1943.00] then we will also get all the groceries 
made from you even in Ramadan.
[1948.48] You don’t worry, 
you will never get a complaint.
[1952.52] Dad, I am going to the office.
[1954.64] Yes, yes, fine son. 
Sir, goodbye.
[1957.76] Yes,  yes, thank you.
[1960.48] May God protect you son.
[1967.04] Mama,
[1969.56] I am hungry. Give me breakfast.
[1972.52] Breakfast?
[1973.96] Is this time for breakfast?
[1975.80] I am preparing for lunch.
[1978.36] Having an off doesn’t mean that you stay 
awake all night and wake up late in the morning.
[1982.08] Go, make tea and have rusk with it.
[1985.48] I just get one day to sleep, mama,
[1987.56] still you have an objection on it.
[1989.76] Okay, make a fried flatbread.
[1991.92] There is no fried flatbread.
[1993.52] Go make tea and have it with rusk.
[1998.00] Hey, child, Annie, make extra tea.
[2001.88] I too will have it.
[2003.40] And look at this Ramsha, 
she is still sleeping.
[2006.60] This girl has made my life hell.
[2009.76] I will check on her.
[2012.76] Ramsha.
[2015.72] Oh God. Ramsha.
[2018.04] Mama, I don’t want to have rusk.
[2021.20] There is flour in the fridge, I will make 
fried flatbread myself and eat it.
[2023.24] Useless.
[2028.56] Okay, find me the flour in the fridge.
[2031.80] I am coming.
[2041.40] I think the queen is still sleeping.
[2044.40] Ramsha.
[2049.40] Ramsha.
[2063.56] She is not even in the bathroom.
[2066.28] Where can she go so early
 in the morning?
[2068.32] She must have gone upstairs 
to the roof to make a Tik Tok.
[2071.16] Ramsha.
[2074.80] Ramsha.
[2076.52] Ramsha.
[2081.28] God knows where she went.
 Ramsha.
[2085.04] Hey…
[2086.80] What happened? 
Why are you so worried?
[2088.84] That…
[2090.20] Salma, that…
Sister in law, what happened?
[2091.60] All okay?
[2093.60] I don’t know where Ramsha has gone.
[2096.64] She is not even in her room.
[2098.60] Where is there to worry in this?
[2100.40] She must be sitting in a corner here
 and making a video.
[2103.52] Hey, I looked all around, 
I even went to the roof,
[2106.88] I have looked all around the house,
[2109.44] I don’t know where she went.
[2111.44] Okay…yes, I will find her phone.
[2115.08] She must have kept her phone 
and gone.
[2120.08] Yes, I too haven’t seen her 
since morning.
[2124.84] She must have surely left her 
phone here somewhere and gone.
[2148.84] If you people had understood me,
[2151.44] and let me progress in life,
[2153.56] then maybe I wouldn’t have 
taken this step.
[2156.68] I didn’t want to leave the home 
and go like this.
[2159.40] But I have to leave.
[2162.28] Papa’s fear,
[2163.76] and your strictness was a hurdle 
in my success.
[2169.60] So today I am leaving everything today 
and going on my new journey.
[2174.28] Sister in law, what happened?
[2176.12] I know you and papa will get really upset
 with me reading this letter,
[2181.88] you won’t even forgive me,
[2185.60] so it is useless to ask you 
to forgive me.
[2190.48] Your beloved daughter, Ramsha.
[2248.88] Compartment number 11482.
[2252.92] It is not here.
[2254.76] 11483..
