[26.28] Afnan?
[29.68] Afnan?
[35.64] Uncle has gone home, 
you must go home too,
[39.52] I will stay here with Ramsha.
[41.32] There is no need for you to stay here.
[48.16] I am not going anywhere, 
I will stay here.
[53.48] Afnan, you will get unwell like this.
[57.96] Did you guys talk to Shani?
[60.96] No his phone is not going through.
[70.56] And he is on his way anyway
[72.20] so I don’t want to give him such news 
while he is on his way.
[81.56] He will be here by tomorrow
[83.32] then I will talk to him and 
what did the doctors say to you?
[87.24] When will they discharge Ramsha?
[89.92] yes, doctor said they will discharge him 
by tomorrow.
[94.76] Um,
[98.28] I was trying to say that
[102.08] we cannot take Ramsha home for now,
[112.84] do us a favor, take Ramsha 
to your home.
[126.28] Once Shani comes home,
[128.32] I will talk to him and bring her home.
[131.36] Umm yes, he is absolutely right
[134.72] and because Ramsha is already 
going through a trauma,
[142.04] it will be better if she is with you guys.
[144.68] And you know how short-tempered Shani is,
[148.64] God forbid, he immediately starts getting 
angry on Ramsha after coming back.
[160.64] So once he comes back tomorrow,
[162.32] I will talk to him and bring him 
to meet Ramsha,
[167.28] that will be better.
[178.04] Okay, as you wish.
[186.00] You may go home, 
Annie is alone here,
[188.24] I will stay here with Ramsha.
[193.52] Okay as you wish.
[197.64] Bye. 
Bye.
[202.00] I am with Ramsha.
[234.56] What will I say to Ramsha’s in-laws?
[237.52] She was staying here, 
she was our responsibility,
[240.24] such a huge accident happened to her,
[243.12] she lost her baby.
[250.28] What will they say that 
we couldn’t even take care of her?
[253.84] Brother, I have scolded Alizeh a lot,
[263.56] I told her you shouldn’t have
 taken Ramsha
[274.72] but brother now what’s done,
[278.36] it’s not Ramsha’s fault 
or Alizeh’s fault.
[282.88] Whose fault was it and 
whose wasn’t is not the question,
[286.96] in-laws consider it a mistake whenever 
anything happens at a girl’s parents' house.
[298.88] Who would know it better than myself
[305.28] and you what price do 
our daughters have to pay
[307.76] for the accidents that happen
in parents’ house?
[311.80] Brother why are you overthinking?
[319.92] I know
[321.28] that Ramsha’s in-laws are 
very intelligent people,
[330.76] I hope no one will consider this 
Ramsha’s fault.
[338.80] And brother, Alizeh did tell me
[341.32] that Ramsha’s aunt was taking care of 
her with so much love.
[353.60] You just pray for Ramsha,
[355.68] she really needs your prayers
[363.64] and then brother
[365.44] I am very sure that God will bring
 this happiness in her life again
[372.32] and you just pray for her because 
your prayers are very powerful.
[377.80] I don’t know why my prayers never 
get answered in Ramsha’s favor.
[389.32] Whenever I have asked something 
for her, she has never gotten it.
[393.44] Brother, there is a possibility that
[396.32] whatever you are praying for her 
is not good for her.
[404.56] You are the one who says that 
whatever God does is for our good.
[411.08] You are right.
[419.08] May God make decisions 
that are better for Ramsha.
[427.88] Indeed, He is the listener and 
He is the one who knows it all,
[432.68] He is watching everything.
[438.24] Yes, absolutely, indeed.
[461.40] Mom, how did you even think 
not to tell me this
[464.96] and hide it from me.
[468.32] Son,
[469.52] your dad asked me not to tell you 
the whole thing for now.
[473.80] What do you mean?
[475.20] What do you mean by he stopped you?
[478.12] My baby lost his life and you think 
it wasn’t important to tell me?
[484.88] And moreover, my wife didn’t call 
and tell me,
[488.84] that is my value.
[490.76] brother, she tried to call you but 
your phone wasn’t going through.
[496.52] I have told you so many times
to stay quiet.
[504.40] Okay Shani, look,
[506.68] there is no need to get angry 
for no reason,
[508.52] what has to happen, happened.
[510.72] The poor girl is already not well.
[513.92] I will go and make her well.
[516.36] No Shani listen to me, 
don’t go there for God’s sake.
[523.12] Where has Shani gone in such a rush?
[525.52] He is going there to meet Ramsha,
[528.04] please stop him he will go and 
create a scene there.
[531.04] What?
[532.68] Shani has gone to Mr. Qasim’s house?
[534.52] Yes, he has gone to Mr. Qasim’s house.
[536.76] Why did you not stop him?
[538.44] I stopped him a lot but 
when does he listen to me,
[540.96] please stop him, 
he will create a scene there.
[544.56] I asked you not to, 
I asked you not to,
[547.96] that don’t tell him
[549.88] but you will not listen 
you will stay restless.
[554.52] So, he was asking about Ramsha
again and again,
[557.00] he wanted to bring her home 
so I had to tell him.
[560.32] You and your children have made 
my life hell.
[564.40] I came tired from work thinking 
I would rest after going home
[568.92] but with such children, 
there is no rest in my fate.
[599.76] What are you even saying?
[601.56] It is my friend’s farmhouse, 
we all will enjoy a lot and trust me,
[604.92] it will be a very good change 
for you too.
[608.92] No, no Alizeh, I know Shani,
[611.76] he will never allow me, 
I cannot go.
[615.72] Who is asking you to ask Shani?
[618.48] What do you mean? 
I have to inform him.
[623.36] Why do you have to tell Shani?
[625.60] You just told me he has gone 
to Hyderabad for two days,
[632.08] we will go to the farmhouse right now 
and come back,
[634.88] what is the need to tell him?
[644.48] Shani?
[647.80] Shani?
[653.32] so, you got the freedom?
[660.00] Are you in peace now 
after killing my child?
[665.68] What are you saying?
[668.76] Think before you speak,
[670.36] what are you even talking about?
[672.88] He was my child too,
[674.72] if you were his father, 
I was his mother as well,
[677.84] how can you disrespect a mother’s love?
[681.12] What love are you talking about?
[686.40] If you had any love for that child,
[688.32] you would have taken care of 
that child but no
[690.08] you did what you wanted to
[691.92] like you have always done 
what you want,
[695.92] you are free from all the restrictions now,
[698.08] and all the responsibilities and 
that is what you wanted
[700.12] why crying now? Stop crying.
[705.20] Shani?
[707.04] Shani, there is nothing like that,
[709.88] I just made a mistake, 
I didn’t do it on purpose.
[714.88] You didn’t do it on purpose?
[716.88] Why did you even go without 
my permission?
[719.96] Why did you go without my permission?
[722.28] Just because I have no importance to you.
[726.44] I, I called you so many times,
[729.32] I even send you so many messages
[731.76] but your phone wasn’t going through.
[733.12] You even went when my phone 
didn’t go through, you still went
[736.44] because you had to do what you want.
[740.32] There is nothing like that Shani, I,
[742.68] I am very embarrassed 
I made a huge mistake.
[745.52] I am the one who made a mistake,
[746.88] I am the one who made a mistake 
of marrying you.
[751.12] You have always done 
what you wanted, always
[754.20] and we suffered before 
we are still suffering.
[769.48] Shani? Shani, listen to me. 
What is this noise?
[772.44] I don’t want to be with you,
[774.00] I am tired of you and what you do?
[776.48] How much more should I tolerate?
[778.68] I couldn’t even think 
you could be so careless,
[781.08] you have made my life hell. 
Shani?
[785.72] Look Son,
[788.28] we have made a mistake
[799.16] but Ramsha grieving more than you are
[802.88] but there is no point of shouting now.
[815.24] A husband and wife share 
each other’s sorrows,
[818.72] you must understand her pain 
and try to comfort her,
[822.24] that would be better.
[823.68] Mr. Qasim,
[826.04] it is our personal matter,
[828.64] it will be better if you stay quiet.
[840.12] And you,
[842.28] all the crying in front of them, 
what are you trying to prove?
[848.56] You want to show in front of them 
that you are oppressed?
[850.72] That won’t happen because 
I know your reality.
[864.88] Shani, there is no need to shout.
[867.00] If you want to shout at your wife, 
go to your home and do it.
[874.16] There is no need to create this drama 
in my house.
[876.48] So, what do think I am that shameless
that I will take him home after all this?
[894.56] Just understand one thing,
[897.04] I won’t take you away from here,
[899.48] I will leave you here in front of them and
watch you squirm and die in front of them.
[904.12] No No Shani, don’t say that,
[905.64] I am your wife how can you say that?
[932.96] You should have died too with the child.
[936.32] Shut the hell up.
[952.56] Aren’t you ashamed?
[954.96] Your wife is squirming here
 in front of you,
[957.32] she is pain and you don’t care about her?
[960.92] What kind of a husband are you?
[962.16] I have told you it’s a husband and 
wife’s personal matter, do you understand?
[971.48] Don’t interfere else…
[973.20] Else what? Tell me what will you do?
Tell me?
[976.04] Afnan?
[977.80] Afnan, Afnan please you don’t interfere 
in our matter.
[996.04] This is my and Shani’s personal matter
[997.64] uncle please take Shani away from here.
[1009.28] I have lost my child
[1011.04] now I don’t want to lose my husband,
please Afnan leave.
[1026.44] Afnan, I said get quiet. 
Alizeh takes him in the room.
[1030.12] Afnan, for God’s sake, quiet,
[1032.72] why are you increasing trouble 
for the poor girl?
[1036.40] Afnan, Afnan, let’s go.
[1048.56] Wow,
[1050.48] you have a lot of defenders 
in this home.
[1057.76] Stay here with them.
[1059.76] No, No Shani, Shani stop.
[1062.44] Shani?
[1072.44] Shani, I want to go home with you.
[1153.40] I don’t know what scene your son 
must have created there,
[1158.64] May God keep things well.
[1163.64] do one thing,
[1166.52] bring your shawl we will go too.
[1170.28] What is the point of going now?
[1173.00] When I was asking you to go you refused,
now you are asking us to go.
[1179.40] There is no use of going now,
[1181.36] your son must have done 
whatever he wanted.
[1185.64] We won’t get anything 
but embarrassment there now,
[1189.32] I am not going to go.
[1192.28] The truth is
[1195.36] that even I don’t have the courage 
to face Mr Qasim.
[1206.76] Don’t you remember 
what happened last time?
[1209.92] I had to be so embarrassed 
in front of him because of Shani.
[1222.88] I think it’s good we didn’t go.
[1230.76] Let both of them come
[1233.12] and do one thing,
[1235.32] you keep Ramsha in Annie’s room 
for a few days.
[1244.28] I will speak to Shani meanwhile 
and make him understand too.
[1250.28] You call and ask at least
[1253.72] if they leave from there.
[1258.88] We should find out at least if Shani 
didn’t create a very big drama.
[1265.04] Not me, I will get you the phone, 
you do it.
[1269.20] Here,
[1270.64] you call yourself.
umm but..
[1273.36] Shani is here.
[1279.08] Shani?
[1281.64] Son, where is Ramsha?
[1288.12] Shani?
Shani?
[1316.32] You should be ashamed,
[1318.68] you ruined Ramsha’s life and 
now you are sitting here peacefully?
[1321.92] What did I do?
[1323.04] You have done everything
[1328.96] and Ramsha has to pay for it.
[1332.32] I didn’t beg her to come with me,
[1339.68] she went there by her own choice
[1341.72] so please don’t blame me.
[1346.60] Whatever is happening with her today 
she is responsible for it herself,
[1349.36] she is not a baby.
[1351.00] But you are very selfish
[1356.04] and I knew it very well that 
you won’t ever realize your mistake.
[1363.48] There is still time,
control yourself,
[1365.80] before it’s too late.
[1420.32] It is my friend’s farmhouse, 
we all will enjoy a lot and trust me,
[1423.44] it will be a very good change 
for you too.
[1427.52] No, no Alizeh, I know Shani,
[1430.48] he will never allow me, I cannot go.
[1434.64] Who is asking you to ask Shani?
[1437.24] What do you mean? 
I have to inform him.
[1442.20] Why do you have to tell Shani?
[1444.44] You just told me he has gone 
to Hyderabad for two days,
[1449.68] we will go to the farmhouse right now
and come back,
[1452.64] what is the need to tell him?
[1507.44] Just understand one thing,
[1509.80] I won’t take you away from here,
[1512.00] I will leave you here in front of them
[1513.92] and watch you squirm and 
die in front of them.
[1516.48] No, no, Shani, don’t say that,
[1518.32] I am your wife how can you say that?
[1535.20] you should have died too with the child.
[1695.56] Why are you so worried?
[1698.96] What should I do if not get worried?
[1701.20] Didn’t you see
[1702.56] how much wrong things have Shani
said to Ramsha?
[1710.52] And even after begging so much 
he didn’t take Ramsha.
[1715.40] it’s good that Shani did this to her.
[1718.56] What are you saying?
[1720.64] I am absolutely right mom.
[1726.92] I guess you are forgetting
[1729.44] that this is the same Ramsha 
because of which Afnan insulted me.
[1739.12] You all can forget 
but I can never forget
[1741.80] how painful were those days for me.
[1744.80] Remember one thing
[1747.24] that Ramsha staying here is 
very dangerous for you
[1756.96] because Ramsha will get everyone’s 
sympathy for as long as she lives here.
[1769.80] And when Afnan will show 
sympathy towards Ramsha,
[1773.84] so you will be the one 
who is hurt the most.
[1782.24] Alizeh you shouldn’t have taken 
Ramsha to the farmhouse.
[1787.12] Just like everyone else even 
you think it is my fault?
[1789.76] Of course it is your fault,
[1796.60] that is why brother is so upset with you
and Afnan is so mad at you.
[1807.48] Whenever I try that there is 
no complaint from your end,
[1811.60] that’s it you make a mistake 
right then and there.
[1821.80] Alizeh, just because of your 
own foolish actions,
[1825.96] brother and Afnan are being
negative about you.
[1834.52] Just pray that Ramsha leaves 
as soon as possible from here
[1842.96] else you will be living in hell here,
[1852.76] just remember this.
[1908.52] Afnan? Mistrusting someone is a sin,
[1912.84] looks like you haven’t forgiven her 
by heart yet.
[1922.04] Look Afnan I want to see you
and Alizeh happy.
[1932.60] Trust me I will be very glad 
if both of you are happy.
[1950.72] Where is Ramsha? 
Is she okay?
[1953.96] Why don’t you answer me? 
Where is Ramsha? Is she fine?
[1957.84] Afnan,
[1959.84] she has lost her baby in this accident.
[1979.12] Your wife is squirming here 
in front of you, she is pain
[1984.68] and you don’t care about her? 
What kind of a husband are you?
[1988.08] I have told you it’s a husband and 
wife’s personal matter, do you understand?
[1994.80] Don’t interfere else…
[1996.76] Else what? Tell me what will you do?
Tell me?
[1999.60] Afnan? Afnan,
[2002.52] Afnan please you don’t interfere 
in our matter.
[2010.48] This is my and Shani’s personal matter
[2011.96] uncle please take Shani away from here.
[2018.64] I have lost my child
[2020.72] now I don’t want to lose my husband,
please Afnan leave.
[2070.08] Ramsha, okay now stop crying,
[2079.04] if you cry like this you will get 
more unwell.
[2083.24] How should I stop crying, Annie?
[2085.32] Do I have anything else 
to do except crying now?
[2088.76] I do not have anything else 
left except crying.
[2097.76] You all,
[2099.12] you all should have been with me,
[2101.24] none of you is with me.
[2111.48] No one cares about me.
[2114.16] Please don’t consider yourself 
alone like this.
[2122.56] I am here,
[2123.68] mom is, we are all with you.
[2126.96] Listen to me Annie,
[2128.44] such a huge accident has 
happened with me,
[2131.12] did you even come to meet me once?
[2137.44] No, right?
[2143.80] Annie, if the relationship has changed 
between us, is our love over too?
[2148.08] It’s not that Ramsha,
[2149.92] I know you need a friend right now.
[2166.60] What can I do?
[2167.88] I have asked Mom so many times 
to make me meet you
[2171.60] she is not listening to me.
[2179.96] Don’t get disheartened,
[2182.00] I will definitely come to meet you.
[2185.68] You ask uncle to send Shani here,
[2190.96] ask him to send Shani and call me 
home I don’t want to stay here, Annie.
[2203.24] Annie you guys are my family,
[2205.56] I need you all in these hard times, 
I need support from you all.
[2220.56] I don’t have anyone, 
I am all alone,
[2223.16] just ask Uncle to call me there 
as soon as possible through Shani,
[2227.16] I don’t want to live here anymore,
I need you all.
[2235.00] yes, yes, don’t worry,
[2237.24] I will talk to Dad, okay?
[2239.48] don’t worry at all, 
take care of yourself.
[2243.44] Bye.
