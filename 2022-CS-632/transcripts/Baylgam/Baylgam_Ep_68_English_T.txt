[19.96] You look so pretty, brother will
be surprised to see you.
[22.84] Thank you so much, Annie.
[24.12] You have really done
good makeup on me.
[26.24] You are welcome,
[27.20] but you look so pretty…
[28.16] Ramsha,
[31.36] you are standing here and talking,
[32.72] and I am standing outside
for so long and waiting.
[34.76] You see, she looks so pretty.
[38.32] Look, don’t drive me mad.
[39.92] Come if you want to
[40.68] or I will leave you and go.
[49.28] Come on.
[51.08] How does she look!
[53.48] Come on.
[54.56] Okay, bye.
[55.24] Take care. I will be back in a bit.
[56.44] Bye.
[59.68] Brother is really weird.
[73.96] Hey, Shani, how are you?
[76.36] How are you doing?

[87.20] Yes, yes, I introduced her to aunt
[88.96] and also to elder sister.
[96.72] Okay listen,

from Dubai, right?
[100.04] Okay, okay, you are talking
about brother Danish.
[102.44] Yes, him. Brother Danish.
[104.08] Introduce me to him.
[105.92] Yes, he is here. I will just bring him.
[107.84] Yes.
[113.12] Hello.
[115.56] Hello.
[124.00] Hey, I cannot hear you.
[126.28] Yes, hello.
[127.20] Shani.
[127.92] Hello.
[142.24] Sister in law,
[143.52] meet him, he is my cousin,
Danish Kamal.
[146.56] Greetings.
[228.20] You are Ramsha, right?
[239.20] Shopping girl, right?
[274.92] I am sorry. I am so sorry.
[276.92] Where are you going?
[277.84] You are banging into people.
[279.00] What happened?
[279.84] Shani, I feel really restless.
[281.56] I feel nauseous, can we go home?
[283.00] Yes, we will go,
[283.92] but first let the function end.
[285.64] Shani, I am not well,
[287.64] I feel restless, please take me home.
[290.52] You were fine a little while back.
[300.56] I have to meet my friends,
[301.84] I have come after so long,
[303.28] what is wrong with you?
[304.52] Yes, you are right,
[305.88] but right now I feel that
I am really dizzy,
[308.56] I have a bad headache.
[309.92] Please take me
home, Shani.
[318.56] Okay, we will go,
let me call aunt and Asim.
[320.40] No Shani.
[321.20] I mean, inform them over call.
[323.60] Let’s go right now, please.
[331.36] I feel really dizzy.
[332.52] Okay fine, come on.
[334.08] I don’t know what the problem is.
[398.52] Hey child, you people came back so soon?
[401.04] Has the function ended?
[402.12] I think it is just 11 pm right now.
[409.76] Mama, I had told you
[411.12] to let me go alone.
[420.84] But no,
[422.24] you cannot see
peace in my life,
[424.96] you sent this tension with me.
[433.28] Hey, what happened?
What happened?
[440.84] Aunt, I was not well,
[442.64] I had a headache, so we came back.
[449.88] Mama, I couldn’t meet anyone there.
[462.80] You married me to a sick wife.
[476.76] This is the limit.
[477.76] I am tired of her.
[482.68] Aunt, I am going to rest for a while.
[486.92] Are you in your senses?
[488.80] Think before you speak.
[497.68] If that poor thing became unwell,
[501.08] then it is not in the hands of a person.
[503.20] What is her fault in this?
[504.48] Yes, yes, mama,
[505.44] it is all my fault,
[512.48] that I married her
[514.04] and I am living in it till now.
[515.60] What do you mean till now?
[518.24] Huh?
[525.24] Hear one thing, clearly, Shani.
[532.24] Don’t even think of anything like that.
[535.08] Understand?
[544.16] Come on, go and rest
in your room.
[545.76] Come on, take those things
and take them. Come on,
[622.96] You are Ramsha, right?
[634.04] Shopping girl, right?
[659.92] How was the wedding?
[663.88] It was good.
[667.12] You look worried.
[669.12] Nothing. Why?
[671.64] Seeing your face,
I can tell you are worried.
[674.24] Did something happen?
[678.92] Yes, I am not well.
[681.68] I will rest and get better.
[777.40] Your picture will be with me
in a frame on that wall.
[788.76] There is a great character
in my serial.
[796.40] In demand.
[797.84] Really?
[799.12] What is the character?
[805.92] This is the issue with you girls.
[809.48] You want that you get
everything really soon.
[824.64] Dress up well.
[829.04] Something that will bring
out your beauty further.
[833.40] The thing is,
[835.36] this is showbiz,
[838.60] here whatever is visible is sold.
[859.44] Sir, I will bring my phone
in two minutes.
[861.04] I will show you something…
[861.88] Hey, leave the phone.
[868.28] We don’t need the phone.
[870.28] The actor shouldn’t have
their phone when working,
[873.08] their focus is lost.
[874.80] You should put all your
focus on their work.
[878.40] Today you are working
in my drama,
[880.92] you are its heroine.
[882.68] Really soon,
[885.56] you will also be a film heroine.
[894.84] Why did you come to this small flat leaving
my big mansion like home?
[901.72] What is the matter, baby?
[903.56] I feel you have gotten into
the habit of running away.
[907.24] Look, this is not a good habit.
[910.36] Leave from here,
when Hania comes…
[912.08] Listen to me.
[913.20] Leave me.
[914.08] Listen to me. One minute.
[915.56] No.
[919.68] Where did he come from?
[922.04] Open the door.
[923.40] Please, open the door.
[974.60] Tabassum,
[977.60] tell the driver to take out the car.
[979.80] Yes, madam.
[984.92] Where are you going?
[987.60] Where do I go at this time, Afnan?
[991.20] So, can you take an off from
the office today?
[997.92] Why?
[999.28] What do you mean by why?
[1002.08] Because I want this.
[1008.64] Is it not enough that I want this?
[1011.28] Afnan, had I done what you wanted,
[1013.28] then I wouldn’t have been
able to do anything in life.
[1019.48] I would say, leave these things
[1021.00] and get ready.
[1022.24] You too go to the office.
[1023.68] It is getting late.
[1025.16] Listen, please.
[1031.08] I am saying to you
with so much love,
[1033.32] that I want to spend time with you…
[1040.52] I want to talk to you about
what is in my heart.
[1042.08] I want that both of us stay together
all day long and you…
[1045.80] you please stay. Please.
[1048.00] Why are you behaving
like a child, Afnan?
[1051.00] I have a really important
meeting today.
[1056.04] It is necessary for me to go,
or else,
[1057.84] I might have stayed.
[1059.40] We can surely do one thing,
[1061.24] I can try to come early from work,
[1063.36] then we will sit comfortably
and talk. Okay?
[1065.72] Okay.
[1067.04] I am getting late now,
[1067.72] I will come, then. Okay bye.
[1170.24] You really look beautiful in this dress.
[1174.52] Delicate, beautiful,
[1178.08] just like the heroine of my drama.
[1235.76] Who is calling me?
[1238.92] Hello. Greetings.
[1240.76] Greetings.
[1241.88] How are you sweetheart?
[1247.00] Who is this?
[1252.88] It is good. It is good. It is good.
[1261.12] You can forget me,
[1263.96] but I cannot forget you.
[1272.04] We are your lovers,
[1273.76] your appreciators.
[1282.52] This is Danish Kamal.
[1286.52] Sorry, wrong number.
[1310.76] Okay,
[1314.48] wrong number.
[1318.76] Wrong number.
[1390.28] I went to aunt Rasheeda’s home,
[1392.28] Saima was also here.
[1394.96] She was really asking about you.
[1396.24] If you were with me,
[1397.56] they would have been really happy.
[1403.88] Girl, I am talking to you.
[1407.20] Yes?
[1408.28] Where are you lost?
[1409.44] You know I have been
noticing for some time,
[1410.92] you have been lost for a few days.
[1419.96] Okay, thank God,
[1421.20] I felt that you people have left this world.
[1425.04] What nonsense is this?
[1427.00] Yes, so what else do I say mama?
[1427.96] I came here from the shop,
[1429.20] no one is answering their phone.
[1436.40] Hey, I went to aunt Rasheeda’s
home with Annie.
[1439.24] They have a signal issue there.
[1444.96] You know that,
[1446.20] so you should have called on her mobile.
[1452.56] Even her phone is off.
[1454.60] Why is your phone off?
[1465.28] Hello, I am asking you something.
[1466.76] Why is your phone off?
[1479.88] Why is your phone off?
[1482.96] Phone.
[1485.24] My phone is out of charging,
[1487.28] maybe that’s why it is off.
[1489.32] Show me your phone.
[1490.64] Huh?
[1491.84] Show me your phone.
[1492.88] Shani…
[1502.56] The battery is full.
[1514.08] You say weird things.
[1516.20] Here you go.
[1517.28] Okay, then maybe
I switched it off by mistake,
[1520.28] I touched it.
[1526.92] Hey, I don’t know what you are
thinking about nowadays.
[1530.52] Okay listen,
[1531.60] I had asked you to keep the money
in the cupboard that day,
[1533.36] give it to me. I have to take it.
[1535.76] Yes.
[1540.24] These two keep on fighting.
[1575.52] How are you sweetheart?
[1577.56] What did you think?
[1579.04] You will not answer my phone,
[1580.28] you will block my number,
[1581.64] you will get rid of me?
[1583.28] See,
[1584.44] I have reached your doorstep.
[1588.00] Where did you get the
address of my home from?
[1592.92] If a person has strong will,
[1595.08] then they meet the destination.
[1600.84] Go from here.
[1602.08] What?
[1602.76] I said leave from here.
[1604.48] No. No.
[1607.80] Brother Danish. Greetings.
[1610.08] How are you brother?
[1610.80] Why are you standing here?
Come inside.
[1612.64] Hey, I wanted to come inside, but
[1614.88] your wife has an objection, I think.
[1626.16] She is not allowing me to come inside.
[1629.04] Hey, I don’t think she recognized you.
[1642.96] Ramsha, this is Asim’s cousin,
[1645.44] who lives in Dubai.
[1651.16] No, no, I think she has recognized me
[1653.48] she is acting unaware on purpose, right?
[1662.72] Hey brother Danish, come inside.
[1664.60] Ramsha, make tea.
[1759.44] Leave what Shahmeer was telling you.
[1763.76] Just listen to what I am saying,
[1770.08] okay?
[1770.84] Yes, sir.
[1771.96] This is better for your future, okay?
[1779.72] Yes, fine, sir.
[1782.00] and listen,
[1785.04] you will get all the luxuries in this home,
[1790.52] that you wont even get
in a five star hotel,
[1794.16] okay?
[1812.08] Let me tell you one thing
[1826.96] I really like girls like you.
[1846.72] Come on, let’s take a selfie.
[1848.56] Come on.
[1853.68] Friendship selfie, right?
[1855.40] Okay, now tell me,
what will you eat and drink?
[1860.04] Nothing, sir.
[1861.40] I was saying we are a little late,
[1862.64] let’s go home.
[1863.88] What is wrong with you?
[1865.52] What is wrong?
[1867.00] Get used to all these things.
[1869.20] You will be a star. A star.
[1878.84] No, no, sir, I mean,
[1882.24] I feel that I am a little unwell,
[1884.96] so I was saying that let’s go home…
[1885.96] One minute, what happened to you?
[1887.12] No, no, sir.
[1888.20] I am just unwell,
[1889.96] I don’t have fever.
[1891.80] What is wrong with you?
[1895.04] You are a lucky girl,
[1896.80] who is sitting with me on
this table at this time,
[1901.36] or else people long to
take pictures with me.
[1962.00] Brother, don’t worry.
[1963.84] Let me know when you get your visa.
[1965.96] I know a lot of people there,
[1967.60] your work will be done.
[1969.28] Thank you brother Danish.
[1976.48] You have removed all my tension.
[1979.52] I was so worried that
[1980.72] I am going to a new country,
[1983.28] I don’t know the language there.
[1991.52] You removed my worry.
[1993.64] You turned out to be an angel for me.
[1995.48] Hey, don’t call me an angel.
[1997.56] I consider you my brother,
[1999.16] that is why.
[2028.72] Ramsha, serve tea.
[2045.20] Brother Danish,
[2046.08] I want to show the documents
I submitted.
[2048.44] Should I show them to you?
[2052.08] Yes, yes, bring them.
[2053.44] I will bring them.
[2069.76] Wait.
[2108.92] Amazing.
[2111.96] You are really an actress.
[2115.56] A great actor.
[2119.24] You are playing the role of a decent,
pure, respectable, wife.
[2124.72] I liked this style of yours.
[2126.72] By the way, I like you in every way.
[2133.60] Why did you come here?
[2136.20] When you left I went tired
looking for you.
[2140.20] I got tired.
[2141.96] And see,
[2143.24] where have I met you.
[2147.00] Nothing you are thinking is right.
[2149.84] I have left that world.
[2152.04] I have no relation with that world.
[2154.04] I have really changed.
[2161.24] You know.
[2163.20] You know well the thing that
[2164.88] goes far from me,
[2169.84] the desire it increases further in me.
[2183.24] And you?
[2188.40] You are a drug for me.
[2192.64] A drug.
[2195.56] Stay in your limit.
[2197.56] I am not that same Ramsha from
before, understand?
[2200.76] I have no interest in you and your field.
[2205.36] But I have an interest in you.
[2208.36] A lot of interest.
