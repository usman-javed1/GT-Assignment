[31.12] Where are you going? Yeah?
[33.16] I have asked you to bring Ramsha 
for the wedding ceremony,
[36.04] he doesn’t have a lot of time,
[38.16] he has to go to perform another 
wedding ceremony.
[41.64] Okay, but let me go check on sister in law,
 I don’t know where is she.
[44.40] Ummm actually I forgot to tell you 
that sister in law is not well,
[49.08] she is resting.
[50.52] Really?
[51.60] Sister in law didn’t tell me,
 I will go check on her.
[53.88] oh ho, if you will go there 
who will attend the guests?
[59.52] You do one thing go make tea 
for the guests,
[62.68] I will ask Annie to come to 
the drawing room with Ramsha
[65.92] and I will tell sister in law,
[69.32] what are you thinking?
[70.96] The Muslim scholar has another 
wedding ceremony to attend.
[73.72] Go, good girl. Hurry up, 
it’s time for wedding ceremony.
[78.08] Okay.
[116.76] Is anyone here?
[137.84] Wait,
[139.92] where are you going? Yeah?
[141.40] Sister in law has a headache, 
I thought of giving her tea,
[145.44] she has been working all day,
[147.40] she must be tired so let me give her tea, 
she will get better.
[150.44] Umm actually I told you that sister in law
is not well so she is sleeping.
[153.52] So what?
[155.20] We already have to bring Ramsha 
for wedding ceremony,
[158.04] so I will also wake her up.
[159.60] What is wrong with you Salma?
[161.72] I am telling you sister in law is 
not well she is sleeping,
[165.52] you will wake her up from the light sleep 
so she can get even more unwell,
[169.36] and by the way sister in law 
has asked me
[171.96] if the Muslim scholar comes, 
we can proceed with the ceremony,
[175.68] she will join as soon as
 she feels better,
[178.68] understand?
[180.48] Okay.
[182.20] Mom, where is my jewelry? 
I cannot find it.
[185.36] Annie, I asked you to bring Ramsha, 
why didn’t you bring her yet?
[188.84] I will bring her, 
let me find the jewelry first.
[190.68] Forget jewelry,
[193.32] my child listen to what I am saying,
[195.12] bring Ramsha, the Muslim scholar 
is waiting
[197.96] he doesn’t have a lot of time, 
he has to go, go.
[201.40] Go, you also go with her, 
go bring her, hurry up,
[204.28] go, good girl, bring her quickly, 
I am standing here.
[208.60] Come back quickly.
[213.32] Coming.
[218.08] You go and bring Ramsha, 
I will be back.
[221.68] Where are you going? 
I will be back. Go.
[262.80] Sister in law?
[264.60] Sister in law?
[269.12] What happened? Sister-in-law?
 What happened?
[272.84] Who tied you here? Yeah?
[275.24] Anwar was saying that 
you are not well, you are resting.
[278.64] Salma, for God’s sake help me.
[280.72] Help me, for God’s sake.
[283.40] Look you have a daughter too 
you must realize this,
[287.04] help me for God’s sake,
[289.76] get me out of here,
[292.40] I will go anywhere, 
I will go anywhere.
[295.16] I.. i…
[297.32] I cannot trust Anwar anymore,
[299.00] after what Anwar has done to me, 
I cannot trust him at all
[303.20] and if Ramsha said no to the wedding,
[306.60] I don’t know,
[308.48] I don’t know what Anwar will do to me 
and my daughter.
[311.24] I will go anywhere 
but I cannot trust him,
[315.32] he didn’t even care about 
the relationship we have.
[318.76] How can I trust him?
 Have mercy on me,
[321.28] I beg you, I touch your feet 
and beg you.
[324.92] But sister in law where will you go
 with your young daughter?
[328.12] It’s not that easy.
[329.60] Salma, actually, my father’s friend 
lives in Hyderabad,
[332.76] I will go to them.
[334.52] But sister-in-law this is not 
as easy as you may think,
[338.20] you have a young daughter with you,
[340.16] how can you trust a stranger?
[343.52] When you cannot trust your own family
[346.60] you have to trust strangers.
[355.68] I…
[357.60] I…
[359.68] I will think of something.
[425.00] Afnan? You cut your hand wait. 
Leave it.
[431.60] You don’t have to show sympathy to me.
[434.92] Afnan?
[453.08] Yes Annie, but where is mom?
[454.68] She hasn’t come to my room for so long.
[456.12] Aunt is a little unwell, 
you get ready meanwhile.
[460.88] Okay I will get ready, 
just call mom once,
[463.32] I have some work from her Annie.
[464.96] Wear this meanwhile Ramsha,
[467.16] I am telling you that get ready meanwhile.
[468.68] okay I am going to go and change then.
[471.08] Ramsha? 
Mom?
[472.48] Ramsha?
Mom, what happened?
[473.96] Why are you crying? 
Are you feeling well, mom?
[476.68] Do one thing, just pack the things 
that you need,
[480.92] hurry up, I am telling you to hurry up.
[483.32] What happened, mom?
[484.64] Ramsha, there is no time for questions 
and answers,
[486.80] just hurry up and do what 
sister in law is saying.
[488.28] Sister in law, help her pack 
the important things, quickly.
[490.28] Mom, wedding ceremony.
[491.92] Come. 
Okay, fine.
[493.16] Quick. 
Come, come.
[569.84] Salma, thank you so much,
[572.60] how should I thank you?
[574.44] Sister in law? What is there 
to thank about?
[577.88] I am just trying to make it up for
 the sins my husband did.
[583.04] Sister in law,
[584.60] I am very embarrassed in front of you, 
whatever has happened,
[588.52] it was very wrong,
[590.84] forgive me, and never curse my children.
[594.20] What are you saying Salma?
[596.68] Why would I curse you?
[598.72] I have no complaints from you, 
I have no complaints from you.
[612.60] Okay, enough, don’t waste time,
[614.84] quickly leave from this gate.
[616.60] Aunt s absolutely right,
[618.20] let’s go from this way, 
everyone will see us there.
[620.52] Yes.
[646.84] The flower necklace here,
[649.32] a groom is incomplete without 
the flower necklace,
[651.44] wear it, wear it, good boy,
[653.60] now you look like a groom.
[656.48] Brother Anwar, please hurry up
 and call the bride,
[659.64] I have to go somewhere else too 
to perform the wedding ceremony.
[662.04] Yes, yes, Muslim scholar, 
I will just bring her. Okay?
[667.00] I will be right back.
[693.72] Ramsha?
[697.68] Ramsha?
[706.16] Ramsha?
[715.24] Umm,
[716.68] where is Ramsha?
[717.92] Ramsha, I don’t know I was in the kitchen. 
Where is Ramsha?
[722.44] Neither sister in law is in her room, 
nor Ramsha is in her room,
[725.60] that is what I am asking you, 
where is Ramsha?
[727.76] I asked you to bring her.
[731.00] I don’t know.
[742.96] Annie, you were with her.
[747.12] I was in the bathroom.
[750.04] Salma, don’t hide anything from me,
[752.56] where did both mother and daughter go?
[755.00] Tell me? Where did they go?
[758.16] I don’t know I was in the kitchen.
[760.40] I will kill you.
[767.48] Tell me where did they go.
[770.32] I don’t know.
[809.64] Uncle,
[812.04] where is Afnan?
[813.48] My child, he left for the airport.
[817.84] Left for the airport?
[820.12] Yes, he has a meeting in 
Islamabad tomorrow.
[828.36] He did not tell you?
[831.68] He didn’t even meet you before leaving?
[840.28] Hey?
[842.52] Is everything all right, Alizey?
[846.32] Yes uncle, he was with me a while ago.
[854.00] Umm, he told me I guess it slipped 
off my mind, I was busy.
[858.52] Okay so what is there to worry about?
[862.04] Call him.
[864.28] Yes, I will call him.
[899.04] How can they leave like this?
[903.00] Anwar, I don’t know anything
[905.16] where and when did sister in law 
take Ramsha.
[908.00] I was making tea in the kitchen, 
I don’t know anything.
[921.52] Annie?
[923.48] You tell me?
[925.64] You tell me, where did they go?
[931.48] I told you, I, I was in the washroom.
[934.04] You are lying.
[945.12] Both of you are lying.
[954.68] Both of them cannot leave from here 
with you two being involved.
[959.72] No, no, I am not lying at all, 
I was honestly in the kitchen.
[964.08] Shut the hell up…
Enough, dad, enough!
[967.84] With they come of you scream like this
and raise your hands?
[976.28] How did they go? 
Why did they go?
[978.36] All of this is of no use now.
[990.60] I have suffered such a huge loss today
[994.16] because of this dumb woman 
and such disobedient children.
[997.08] Yes, don’t be so surprised, 
a useless child like you!
[1011.24] I will not let those mother and 
daughter go away so easily.
[1025.72] How far they can go?
[1028.04] I will find them and bring them from 
the netherworld, the netherworld.
[1044.52] And whatever needs to be done now, 
I will do it all alone,
[1048.88] it doesn’t make any difference 
if you are here or not.
[1058.56] Remember Salma,
[1061.32] if you or your daughter turn out to be 
behind all this,
[1067.08] I will be the worst.
[1107.76] mom, what will we do?
[1111.80] Stay quiet.
[1151.44] Mom, why did we get off here?
[1152.76] Because we have to cross 
this road and go,
[1156.48] Salma called and said that Anwar has 
gone out to look for us. Hurry up.
[1160.72] Mom, I am feeling so scared. 
Nothing will happen.
[1163.08] okay come. 
Let’s go. Mom?
[1183.96] What do you do? 
Can’t you see and drive?
[1186.56] Sir, it’s not my fault,
[1188.60] she was crossing the road 
like this and …
[1190.40] You hit her and then tell me 
it’s not your fault.
[1192.00] Yes, we are here, I am making a call,
[1194.08] I am calling the ambulance.
[1248.12] Greetings.
[1249.56] Greetings. 
Mr Qasim,
[1251.92] I am sorry to bother you at this time, 
my apologies for that.
[1255.48] Why apology?
[1257.96] You are saying this because you think 
that I am not an ordinary poor person?
[1263.92] Mr inspector,
[1265.60] what do you think that the laws are just 
for ordinary and poor people in this country?
[1268.88] Don’t do this.
[1270.52] Sir you are getting me wrong.
[1272.44] It will be better if I am taking it wrong
[1275.76] else your courtesy can ruin
 my life hereafter,
[1280.76] my Prophet (PBUH) has said that
[1287.56] before you those people were ruined,
[1291.72] who used to leave the powerful 
for their weakness
[1295.88] and would punish the weak for stealing.
[1300.28] You tell me,
[1301.92] you will save me in this world, 
Inspector,
[1305.56] but the mistake that I have made,
[1308.96] I will get punished for it on the day 
of judgement, who will save me?
[1313.36] Sir, that wasn’t my intentions at all,
[1316.08] if you felt that, then I am sorry for that.
[1319.32] No, no, God forbid,
[1321.68] I was just saying that whatever 
your legal formalities are,
[1324.84] do that I am here at the hospital, 
my lawyer will talk to you.
[1328.76] By the way, Mr Qasim, 
you should be praised
[1332.28] that you bring them here,
[1334.36] else nowadays, people let dead bodies
[1338.56] and the injured squirm after 
hitting them in an accident,
[1342.68] and innocent people lose their lives 
because of their minor mistake.
[1346.28] May God have mercy. Sister, 
how are the two ladies?
[1349.72] Sir, a patient is critical
[1351.76] and this other patient along with her 
is out of danger now.
[1364.20] Oh God! Have mercy, my Lord.
[1374.32] Mom?
[1377.72] Mom?
[1379.00] Mom? 
Keep on lying down,
[1380.64] don’t even try to get up, okay?
[1383.40] Where is my mom? 
Where is my mom?
[1386.84] The one who came here with you 
was your mother?
[1388.96] yes.
[1390.80] Where is my mom? Is she okay?
[1394.20] Where is she? 
What are you doing?
[1396.36] She is absolutely fine, you just lie down 
you cannot meet her right now.
[1398.92] Where is my mom, 
why don’t you answer me?
[1400.76] Is mom fine? 
What happened to her?
[1403.24] Your mother is in the operation theater,
[1404.84] a surgery is being performed on her, 
you keep on lying down.
[1407.24] In operation theater?
[1408.80] Is she fine? What happened to her?
[1411.16] I need to see the doctor, 
I need to meet mom.
[1413.36] Yes, yes, she is fine, 
you j ust lie down, please rest.
[1418.32] My mom.
[1435.56] Shani,
[1437.48] why didn’t you sleep yet, son?
[1439.64] Go sleep. Why are you awake?
[1443.60] What should I do?
[1446.00] I have nothing left except troubling myself.
[1450.24] My child,
[1451.60] what had to happen, it did
[1454.16] then why are you affecting your health 
by stressing over it for no reason?
[1460.52] Mom, I don’t understand,
[1463.12] what place did they find? 
Where did they disappear?
[1466.84] Bus stands, railway stations,
[1469.76] I went to all the places I could,
[1472.00] I didn’t find them anywhere.
[1481.00] By the way mom let me tell you something,
[1488.36] I think it is another issue,
[1491.56] both of them has gone to the police station 
to file an FIR against us.
[1494.92] No, no,
[1497.52] sister in law will not do anything like that,
[1502.96] why would she go to the police station
 anyway?
[1505.20] You don’t think that for no reason.
[1509.96] She wouldn’t know anything like that.
[1511.88] Mom, you haven’t understood them yet,
[1515.12] if they can leave our home 
they can do anything,
[1523.36] I am telling you, that they have 
gone to the police.
[1531.92] And this Ramsha, you don’t know her,
[1534.80] this game is planned by her, 
I am telling her.
[1536.72] No Shani, don’t think like that 
without any reason,
[1540.04] sister in law will never do that,
[1542.64] after all why would she do it? 
Why should she file an FIR
[1544.88] and bring the police for us?
[1547.32] Mom, look, look, I was telling that 
they will bring police on us,
[1552.12] go and check, 
they have brought the police.
[1554.76] Okay.
[1556.40] Go and check. Go, check.
[1561.24] What happened? What…
Shut up. Shut up,
[1564.20] don’t ask what happened about 
everything.
[1569.24] Open the door.
[1570.52] Who is it?
[1571.84] It’s me, son of brother Majeed.
[1573.80] Okay, okay.
[1576.76] Aunt? 
Yes?
[1578.08] my mom is so unwell,
[1580.00] I called the ambulance, 
my bike is not getting started too,
[1582.96] please send Shani with me, 
we will bring the ambulance,
[1586.32] if we don’t find the ambulance
Yeah?
[1587.80] So then we will get the taxi. 
Okay, okay, I am calling him.
[1594.12] You scared me.
[1595.84] Our neighbors brother Majeed,
[1597.36] his son is here, his mom is not well
[1599.64] so he is here to get the motorbike 
from you, go.
[1602.40] They just find our home.
[1606.76] He is here to get the motorcycle.
[1608.96] He scared me for no reason.
[1619.32] The operation has been done
[1621.92] but that woman is still unconscious, 
her condition is critical,
[1629.16] it is because of me that a woman is 
fighting life and death today,
[1635.68] I am responsible for her condition 
and pain.
[1638.88] uncle,
[1640.68] but this is an accident
[1643.08] and anyone can do an accident,
[1647.12] why are you blaming yourself?
[1650.68] You were not even driving the car.
[1653.12] What are you saying, Alizey?
[1656.16] Someone’s whole life can be 
spent in pain
[1659.44] and we can just easily get away 
calling it an accident?
[1663.28] Whatever it is, I was present in the car,
I am responsible for this accident.
[1669.68] Okay uncle, don’t worry,
[1671.92] god will make things better for her.
[1674.64] Amen,
[1676.36] if God forbid something happens 
to the woman,
[1681.44] I will never forgive myself.
[1686.92] Nope.
[1690.28] Brother, I have got the food served, 
come let’s eat.
[1695.84] No, Afsheen, I am not hungry,
[1698.20] I will just leave for the hospital.
[1701.36] Brother you just came back 
from the hospital.
[1706.48] Umm, you did as much as you could,
[1710.20] now I think you must call their relatives
 and ask them to take care of the rest.
[1720.52] Infact, I will suggest you ask 
the girl to call her family,
[1725.12] they should look after the rest.
[1727.52] Okay, I will talk to the girl 
when she gets better
[1737.76] but I just hope God make things right. 
Okay I will leave now.
[1742.40] Brother, at least have food.
[1745.28] Afsheen, I don’t know if that girl must 
have eaten anything or not.
[1751.12] I will leave for the hospital, 
I will eat something there.
[1753.96] Brother, please have food.
[1756.08] I am telling you I will eat something there.
[1767.08] Mom, now don’t worry for uncle,
[1770.80] you know that is how he is,
[1773.24] now unless that mother and daughter 
gets well and go home,
[1776.56] uncle won’t sit in peace,
[1778.96] why do you worry?
[1782.08] Okay I am hungry, let’s eat together,
[1784.76] come, get up.
[1793.32] Now can you tell me where is my mom?
[1795.80] Is she okay?
[1797.08] What is she doing? 
Is she feeling better?
[1799.48] Doctor will tell you about this, okay?
[1803.92] The doctor is calling me now, 
you must rest,
[1806.20] I will be right back okay? 
Don’t go anywhere.
[1809.28] ask the doctor about my mom. 
Okay, okay.
[1822.12] Ramsha,
[1824.60] do you know
[1827.36] that I had a strange fear in my heart,
[1835.00] I used to think that
[1837.48] whether I will even get a chance to see
 you as a bride while I am alive
[1845.68] or would there ever be a chance that 
you are happily married while I am still alive.
[1859.76] Ramsha? 
Mom?
[1861.04] Ramsha?
Mom, what happened?
[1862.72] Why are you crying? 
Are you feeling well, mom?
[1865.56] Do one thing, just pack the things 
that you need,
[1869.92] hurry up, I am telling you to hurry up.
[1872.00] What happened, mom?
[1873.28] Ramsha, there is no time for 
questions and answers,
[1875.76] just hurry up and do what
 sister in law is saying.
[1877.12] Sister in law, help her pack 
the important things, quickly.
[1879.20] Mom, wedding ceremony.

[1880.96] Okay, fine. 
Quick.

operation but …
[1907.32] But what doctor? 
Is the patient okay?
[1911.00] Look I will tell you absolutely clearly

[1924.00] Patient has slipped into coma 
after the operation,
[1938.08] when will she get conscious
[1940.32] and when wouldn’t she,
[1942.32] no one can say anything about it.
[1954.96] You are the only one responsible 
for all this.
[1957.08] Because you my mother is 
in this condition today,
[1960.04] I am telling you
[1961.56] if anything happens to my mom, 
I won’t leave you.
[1964.16] Hey?
Hey what are you doing?
[1965.96] If anything happens to my mother..
