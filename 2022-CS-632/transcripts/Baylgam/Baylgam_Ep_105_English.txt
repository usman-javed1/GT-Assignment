No, no, Mr. Afnan, you are understanding wrong,
there is nothing like that. Please, whatever you are doing 
with her is wrong. I am doing wrong? Shani, I don’t want to hear
 anything from you. It would be better that you leave 
from here right now. You are doing wrong with her. Don’t do that. I don’t believe it that you are saying 
this to me, Shani. I am doing wrong with Ramsha? What do you know what misunderstanding 
has developed between us? And you did wrong with her. Did you forget? You were so unjust and cruel 
to Ramsha. How can you come here today 
and tell me, I am doing wrong with her, when you don’t know anything. You are right. I am getting punished for what 
I did with her and I am regretting it. But I want that you don’t make 
the mistake I made. Even I am regretting, Shani. I am regretting loving Ramsha. I am regretting that 
I always protected her. I am regretting making her my respect
and bringing her to this home. But what did I get in return
for my love? Only regret. As far as you are concerned, if you are regretting so much and you have this wish in 
any corner of your home, then maybe I will leave Ramsha 
and she will come back to you, then forget about it, Shani. I still love Ramsha the same, as I sued to when you 
used to torture her. So, no matter what happens, I will not leave Ramsha. It would be better that 
you leave from here. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything. Did someone come to meet you 
in the academy today? No. why? I was thinking that your relatives 
don’t come to meet you at home, so I was thinking some relative of yours
came to meet you at the academy. No one came to meet me 
at the academy, Afnan. After all, I have no one in the world, so it doesn’t matter to me 
if someone is there or not. Yes, I am talking about Ramsha. What were you talking to her about? Who are you to ask me this? She is my friend. I can talk to her about what I want. What? She is your friend? 
She is your friend? She is more than a friend. Why do I tell you? Mind your own business. 
Understand? Yes, I have called on her number 
several times since morning, but her number is off. I don’t know where she went. She ran away with her lover. Be quiet! You know I am surprised and 
I am a little sad for you too. On the fact that I felt that 
maybe you are her only lover. But there are more here. Afnan, what is all this? If Ramsha wants to leave this home,
then let her go. Why have you disturbed yourself 
and this home because of her? Afnan, don’t you see? Since that girl came to this home, 
nothing is right. I would say, drag her out of this home. You married, Ramsha? Girls like Ramsha look for decent boys, who are not only from a good family, 
but also rich. They marry them. And that’s what Ramsha did. You are a decent man, 
from a good family and rich. Marrying you, she defamed you, and she became famous overnight. After all, you are not the first man 
in Ramsha’s life. Shani? What is he doing here? Greetings. I knew you would surely call, Afnan. Yes, obviously, I had to call. 
Your actions are such. What do you mean? 
What have I done? What do you think? I don’t understand
your cunningness. You convinced your ex-husband to come
 to my home and speak in my favour. What are you saying? I don’t understand anything, Afnan. You are really cunning. Don’t act like you are innocent 
in front of me. Shani came here. He came to my home to speak 
in your favour. No Afnan, there is nothing like that. I didn’t tell anyone anything, 
nor did I send anyone. You have a misunderstanding. If Shani came there, then I have no idea of this, Afnan. Really? So you think that I will believe it that you didn’t cry about your 
helplessness in front of Shani. You didn’t tell him the stories of our home,
you didn’t tell him about me? If you didn’t mention it to him, 
then did he have a divine revelation? How did he find out that I got upset
and left you there? I don’t know how Shani found out,
 Afnan. I didn’t tell anyone about our fight. Neither does aunt know anything, 
nor Annie. So why would I tell Shani? I don’t know what game 
you are playing, Ramsha. I just know that I feel sorry for my fate today. I trusted your false love. I thought that maybe you love me,
but no, all that was a lie, a deceit. It was just word play. I wish this real face of yours had come
in front of me a long time back. I wouldn’t have made a lot of mistakes. Anyway, I don’t want to talk to you. Don’t call me after today. Bye. Hello. Afnan. Afnan. What can lying and hypocritical 
people like you do apart from this? Enough. You have said enough. And they are not making up stories,
 you are. You are telling a fake story 
like always. What was the need for you 
to do all this, Ramsha? I have had enough, there is no place
 for you in this home. Get lost from here. I am not interested in speaking
 in the matters of your life. But when do you know 
how to live your life? How do you know how to 
take right decisions? If you had taken the right decisions, then today my father would 
have been alive. You killed my father. Hey, if you had lived your life properly, you wouldn’t have been here today, 
you would have been at your home. Today, my father would have been alive. And I wouldn’t hate you so much today. This Shani will not let go of my life. Why did you go to Afnan? I am asking you something, 
why did you go to Afnan, Shani? I went to make him understand? You went to make him understand? Shani, have you lost your mind? You first understand yourself, 
then you make others understand. The one who needs to understand 
something the most in the world is you. Ramsha, I cannot see you crying. You were crying last night. I didn’t like it, so I thought I would go and talk to Afnan, 
I will make him understand. Whatever misunderstandings 
you both have, to remove them. Do you have any shame, Shani? Now you were listening to me 
and Afnan talk secretly? And since when did you start 
worrying about my tears, Shani? You didn’t care for my tears, 
when you were supposed to care. For God’s sake, leave me alone. Don’t ruin my life. I just want to see you happy. Stop it. The further you stay from me, 
the happier I will be. Whatever was there between me 
and Afnan, Shani, you have made a mountain 
out of that mole hill. For God’s sake, 
get away from my life, let me live in peace. Ramsha, what is the matter? Why are you getting 
so upset with him? Ask this from your son, aunt. Ask him, why is he not letting me
live in peace? Why does he want to ruin my life? What does he have to do in the matters
between me and Afnan? Why is he interfering? Do you know? He went to Afnan. Afnan is thinking that I sent him to 
Afnan that go and clarify things for me. Shani, you went to Mr. Qasim’s home? When did you go? And you had told me that 
you are going to the shop. I am asking you something. The day Ramsha left from your life 
and this home, the happiness has left this home. At times, I am sure that we have really hurt Ramsha. Annie, what are you saying? Ramsha was a really good girl. She had changed herself 
for the will of God. She became sincere to you, 
she started loving you, but you didn’t care for her. This world is place of karma, brother. Why did you not feel embarrassed when you made fun of my helplessness, 
Shani. You even snatched the roof 
from my home. Along with your life you dragged me 
out of this home. Why did you not feel embarrassed then? I forgive you, Shani. I didn’t forgive you because 
my heart became soft, in fact, I forgave you because I don’t want to keep any relation 
with a man like you. Neither of hatred, nor of revenge. Yes, yes, I have authorized the cheque,
you can deposit it. Thank you so much. 
Thank you. Afnan, why did Shani come? Shani? Who told you Shani came here? Hey, I saw him leaving from 
the home myself. Did something happen? Yes, Shani came. I forgot. Shani is setting up a new shop. So, he came to discuss something 
related to that. Okay, okay, I thought he just came 
to drop Ramsha with his mother. By the way, where is Ramsha? 
Why has she not come till now? Till when will she come? Her uncle is really unwell. I don’t think she will come back 
till he gets fine. Excuse me. Hello. I don’t understand anything. What do I do with this boy? All his life he has done 
what he wanted. He didn’t agree to anything I said. You tell me, what was the need for him to 
go to Afnan’s home like this? What was the need? Call him. I will hit him two to four times, 
then he will understand. Anwar, leave it. If you see him in front of you, 
you will get upset further. Your blood pressure is high anyway. You know, I have scolded Shani badly and I have also apologized to 
Ramsha for Shani’s behaviour. Poor Ramsha was so worried. Was this something 
he should have done? He is a weird emotional boy. He doesn’t think or understand anything.
He went there for no reason. He shouldn’t have gone there 
at any cost. He should remember that not only is he Ramsha’s cousin,
but he is also her ex-husband. How did he go to meet Afnan? You know, poor Ramsha was really worried, 
she was crying. Anwar, she was really worried. 
Now see, one mistake of this boy, one stupidity of is making everyone 
suffer. Everyone is worried. And the people with Annie’s proposal
wanted to come over. Now you tell me, 
we have this issue here, Ramsha is sitting at home. How do I call the people 
with the proposal home? You just do one thing. You make an excuse and 
avoid them. Them coming over here till 
Ramsha is here is not right. Once Ramsha leaves, 
we will see. Fine. These people have me worried. Alizeh, whether you accept it or not, Afnan is surely hiding something. I saw Shani leave from here, 
and he was also angry. He had no colour on his face. Something is surely fishy. Mama, I too feel that 
something has happened. I had to go to the office today, or else 
I would have overheard something. And this Afnan won’t tell us anything. Obviously, why would he tell us? He knows if he says anything, we will say things to him instead. Mama, you call Ramsha and find out, you will surely find out something. In fact, her uncle was unwell, you ask about his health and 
then try to talk further. Yes, that can be done.
