Ramsha I am asking
 what happened here? Afnan, he was talking dirty to me. Hello? What rubbish have 
you said to Ramsha? Oh, so she lit the 
fire between us. Dude, you know these girls they listen from one
 and tell the other one and as far as I know, wives complain their husbands, but Ramsha is not your wife. Shut up, just up. Answer my question. I am joking, dude. I didn’t say anything to her that you should be so mad about, I just said that if she has a problem 
in your house then I can make arrangements 
for her to stay. I know very well what that means, look listen to me carefully, this is not the Ramsha 
you knew from before, she has changed herself a lot 
and I am a witness to it. I have seen it with my own eyes. Oh please forget it, brother, I think that she is just
 trying to impress you. All this is a show off 
to prove she is pious. Whatever she is doing is 
between herself and her God, you don’t have to talk rubbish,
 understand? Afnan, why are you 
getting so serious? It doesn’t make any difference
 to such girls, my brother. I am telling you for one last time, stay away from Ramsha or else… Who was it? Yes party, yes what?
 What what? No who was she? Dude, it wasn’t someone so important that I should tell you it was. Tell me what needs to 
be done about the party else I won’t talk to Dad. No if you have no interest so there is a possibility for me… Let me work on the details as to 
what needs to be spoken with the party. Traffic, traffic, you know how Karachi’s traffic is, even if a person leaves in time but they get stuck somewhere and get late like me. You don’t trust me? Then ask this Fahad, 
tell Fahad. Fahad will tell, Fahad, Fahad will tell, Fahad is my best friend, and do you know the quality of Fahad? Fahad never lies, he always tells the truth, right Fahad? Fahad, this is Ramsha, it is Ramsha’s birthday today, Happy Birthday Ramsha. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Call Madam Ramsha. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Greetings. Are you doing well, my child? Wow, uncle you got a new phone? Uncle, this is the latest version. Amazing, Mom, uncle got a new phone for himself. Hey, no, it is not for me. Greetings uncle. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Did you call me? Ramsha, my child, this is for you. But I have a small phone, uncle. My child, everyone has such phone, you must keep one too, 
you will like it. Thank you, but I cannot take this phone, I don’t need it, uncle. My child, if not for yourself, keep it for my sake. Just consider that your 
uncle got it for you, hmm? Thank you, Thank you. Stay blessed. Get me a good cup of tea then, yeah? Isn’t uncle being a little too 
affectionate on Ramsha? I mean, if he had to give 
her a new phone, he could have given 
her any phone, what was the need for him to give
 her such an expensive phone? That is what I was thinking too. Brother never showed 
you so much love and who does so much 
with strangers anyway? Forget about uncle, Afnan is behaving similarly too. He gives Ramsha’s example on 
everything and praises her. If she took a little care of uncle
 then what is the big deal? But who should tell them this? That is why I tell you to leave your job and focus on your home. Just look at Ramsha,
 she is such a clever girl, she is always 
revolving around brother, she takes care of him, gives him medicines and now she cooks all 
his diet food herself. So what do you want, Mom? I should put my career 
at stake for all this? Alizeh, it is very difficult 
to explain it to you, tell me something when a girl gets married, her career gets connected
 to her husband, and by the grace of God, 
Afnan has everything and whatever belongs to 
him will belong to you so then why are you giving so 
much importance to your career? Mom, let’s think for a minute, if we minus Afnan from my life, so then? What will I be left with? There won’t be Afnan or all of this. Stop talking nonsensical things. God forbid, anything happens to Afnan. You must think before speaking, Alizeh. Mom, please, why don’t you understand? I don’t want to be 
dependent on anyone. May God show you the right path. You say whatever you feel like. Sorry, really sorry,
dude, really sorry, you had to come again 
because of me. That’s not a problem,
 it is a part of our job. I will leave now, dad is waiting. Yes, sure, sure, sure, take care. Greetings. If you would have gotten 
5 more minutes late, I would have taken 
the car from here and then I don’t care if you 
had to come back in a taxi, what the hell. I even refused uncle. Yes, you always refuse uncle, we are the ones who are crazy no matter where we go, 
we have to take you for sure. Let’s go, driver. Come out, come. Madam, you guys sit, I will check. Oh. Are you blind? Can’t you see? Can’t you see the bike? what the hell? Sorry, brother, even you were
 coming from the wrong side. So, your sorry will fulfill my damages? Yeah? Who will pay for my damages? Your bike is absolutely fine. It seems fine and what about the 
internal injuries I got? I will go to the hospital only then I will find out how 
many wounds I have gotten. And this bike, you have broken its engine. You think I am a fool? Even I can see if the engine has malfunctioned 
or your brain. Look, listen to me, just quietly pay for 
my damages here. Pay me Rs10,000 quietly else let’s go to the police station. You will be in trouble. Just give him some money. Come on, son, take out the money. Give that too. Your work will be done in this. Give me the money. No brother, your work will be done
 with this much money, why are you bothering me? Go away. You are one to talk. Move your bike. listen to me, just quietly pay for my damages here. Pay me Rs10,000 quietly else let’s go to the police station. You will be in trouble. Whose number is that? Hello? Annie? Ramsha? Yes, how are you? How are you, Ramsha? Where are you? Where is aunt? Where are you guys? We all miss you so much. Annie, you just tell me, does anyone at home
 know where I am? I wouldn’t be asking you if I knew. Do you know brother and dad
 tried so much to find you but there was no clue of you guys. I cannot believe I am talking to you today. Uncle and Shani both are looking for me? It means they don’t know where am I? yes, Ramsha. No one knows anything about you here. Are you well, Ramsha? Yes Annie, I am absolutely fine and I am completely safe where I am. You take care of yourself and aunt, remember me in your prayers please. But where are you? Okay bye. Hello? Ramsha? Hello, Ramsha? Get lost you ruined the 
whole video again. I didn’t, mom did. Annie? See, mom called. Where are you Annie? No, no, no, Annie, we will complete this video and then you can leave, okay? Mom is calling me. Annie? No Ramsha, 
mom will scold me a lot, please leave my hand. Get lost from here. take this. You took so long, Annie. Hey, there was so much rush in the 
canteen, I was so angry, you don’t do anything yourself, you make me do all the work 
at home and here as well You slacker. did you hear? It is mom’s voice, right? your ears are ringing, don’t you know your mom? When she goes to the market, she comes back hours later. If she sees me making TikToks, I will be in trouble. She doesn’t like making 
these TikToks at all. Actually, mom doesn’t like 
me making TikToks at all. Do you want to waste
 all the time talking or shall we make the video? Make the video properly, I am telling you Annie, if you ruin my video. Stand here, come from there, you will enter the frame at 3 2 1, come on, ready? 3 2 1. What we want in life never happens But what I think, that exactly happens Okay then end of story, no word will ever affect you, so then why should we talk? So then don’t talk, you should stay quiet, don’t try to be my mom everywhere. Look Miss Annie, the things is that you will get into
 trouble by mom whenever, but the trouble that you are 
about to get in by me, I won’t leave you. How did you take Afnan’s name? Now you see, my child. You pulled my braid, again? She doesn’t let me study Okay, okay okay sorry. Ramsha,
 I won’t leave you. Dad, dad, dad. What is going on? Dad, she is hitting me
 so much for no reason. She is lying, she pulled my braid. What happened my child, what is this childish behavior? Why do you bother her? I bother her? You have no idea how 
much she bothers me, she looks very innocent but she is a wild cat from within. Wild cat? I will tell you now. no. I won’t spare you, I will tell you the meaning of wild cat. What does success means? Success is when you have 
achieved something in life, where it’s good for you both 
in this life and hereafter. How is it good for you in 
this world or hereafter, I don’t know when will we 
understand the meaning of success. That is what is called 
success these days that some people should
 recognize you, you should have money and fame, a house, a car and a good job, all this is called success, do you understand And honor? Why doesn’t girls like you
 think before eloping that because of their actions their sisters will have to
 pay for the damage or the girls of their house? What happened Ramsha? Why are you avoiding eye contact? You eloped from the house but I paid for your sin. I got restricted from doing everything, from coming and going to places, to talk on phone, even on combined studies. Please Annie, just help me once, just make me meet him for once. Just think you won’t get such 
a brother-in-law anywhere and I will help you get whatever 
money you demand from him while hiding his shoes,
 for sure. Are you sure? Yes, I am sure. You won’t change. Thank you so much, you are my best sister. Are you happy? You are lying, Ramsha doesn’t get 
happy like this, when Ramsha gets happy, she screams, gets chirpy, 
blooms, make noise, and most of all eats my brain, you did none of it. I told you that one has to change
 their selves with time. No Ramsha, you don’t change yourself, I like you the way you are, laughing smiling, 
always making noise, I like Ramsha that way. Annnie, I am helpless, I cannot tell you anything, I heard your voice after so long, even I wanted to talk a lot to you Annie I wanted to tell you that my mother is no longer
 in this world and how I have got 
so lonely after my mom, I wanted to tell you all of this, 
Annie, exactly the way we used to 
sit before and talk for hours, it was such a good time, everything is over. Everything is over. I wish, I wish that time can come back again, I wish. Where is Alizeh? Madam Alizeh has gone to the office. And Afnan? Sir Afnan is in his room. Okay fine, you may go. You have beautiful hair. You? How dare you come in my room? Why do you keep on getting angry 
at me over everything? I want to be friends with you and you are just mad and mad.. You are such a shameless person, looks like one slap
 wasn’t enough for you so you have come to my room
 to get another slap? You want to slap me again? Here, slap me, but his time make 
sure it’s a tight slap, I want to have the feeling 
of it for a few days. Go away from here, I said leave my room. Don’t you understand? Go away from here. Why? Did your plans change? You don’t want to slap me now? Leave my hands.

will be created now. Oh God. Yes, where are you? Okay I am coming. I told you. How dare you? What happened Afnan? When I asked you stay 
away from that girl then how dare you? You did such a disgusting

that this person, this person is a harasser, he has taken advantage of 
a helpless and a girl without a family, he harassed her. I am ashamed to call 
you my friend today, a disgusting man like you 
shouldn’t be part of this society. Leave me, dude. Is she your lover that you are humiliating your 
friend because of her? You are disgusting who is having fun with an 
outsider despite having a wife at home. Not everyone person is
