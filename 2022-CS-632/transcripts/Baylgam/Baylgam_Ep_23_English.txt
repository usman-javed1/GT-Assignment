Alizay, I was leaving for the office,
should I drop… Drop you off? Yes, I’m just getting ready, 
then you can. Okay, I’m waiting for you downstairs,
come. What, man! Come. Who keeps calling you? 
That you’re declining? I don’t know, it’s an unknown number 
calling, I don’t pick up because it might be 
someone just bothering me. So, what year is going on? 2023 Yes, it’s not 1905, there is the option to block on our phones, 
you can use that. You know, I am not technically 
sound at all. But that’s a good idea, I’ll block it. Come on now, I’ll wait for you. 
Yes, coming coming. Sister-in-law, I’d suggest you should 
talk to brother Sajid as soon as possible, and get the date for a wedding instead 
of an engagement. Nabeel’s mother called, 
she’s giving a proposal, you shouldn’t delay it,
invite them over. Tell me, were you the one to receive their call? Yes sister-in-law, she called me herself, 
I talked to her. Can I tell you something? This proposal is no less than 
a miracle for Ramsha. Once this wedding takes place, people will shut up. Because Nabeel’s mother herself called, she is willing to come over, 
she is offering a proposal, you shouldn’t delay it, invite them over. Look Salma, I also want to marry off Ramsha 
as soon as possible. But… But what, sister-in-law? Do one thing, tell them to give us some time, not now. You can invite them over after a while. Sister-in-law, if you want to accept it, why are you wasting time like this? Okay, I will do as you say. Do you not understand what 
I have told you once, Ramsha? Afnan, don’t talk to me in this tone. Then, what do I do? You are practically forcing me 
to talk to you like this. You have messed up my life, 
why don’t you understand this? So many calls, so many messages. I’ll have to block your number. Afnan, my family is forcing me 
to marry somewhere else, that’s why I have been calling and 
texting you again and again. Oh man, then what do I do? Marry if you want, don’t if you don’t. But stop bothering me. Afnan, please think about me once, just once. Look, my decision is final, 
now please don’t bother me again. Okay, I’m telling you one last time, if you don’t meet me, if you don’t listen to me, I’ll kill myself. Okay, I’ll meet you, but it’ll be our last meeting. Time will decide that for us, not you. Now tell me fast, what’s the matter? Ramsha, hurry up, 
I’ve left my work for this. Yes, Afnan, I had to discuss something important. Look, I know I made a mistake, I shouldn’t have forced you 
so early for marriage. Obviously, no one would have accepted
getting married so soon. I was just trying to tell you… Just once, meet my parents and convince them, after that, you can take as much time 
as you want for the wedding, I’ll handle my parents then, 
just meet them once and convince… Wait a minute, are you mad, or do you think 
I am mad? No, I mean, please let me know. What do you think, I’m not marrying you, 
because I am busy with my work? Yes. 
Have you gone mad? Have you lost your mind? How can you even think that 
I can marry you? It’s my mistake, it’s on me. I shouldn’t have kept a friendship with you,
but I had lost my mind, I thought she is an innocent girl 
who kept getting in trouble so let’s help her but you… You are running after me. And why would I marry you? Who are you? 
What is special about you? You left your studies, I have no idea about your family, and you… You post your videos on social media 
to get famous, and I’ll marry you? You even left your own parents 
to be with me, you didn’t even care about their honor, how would you uphold my honor? The one who isn’t loyal to her parents, won’t be loyal to me either. You have no idea about the importance
of relationships, Ramsha. You only care about you,
your happiness. And I’ll marry you… And yes, about what you were saying, this isn’t about love, I came here for sympathy. I came to help you as sympathy so you could take home some 
of your leftover grace, but no… I didn’t know you would become 
my headache. And yes, another thing, thank God that it was me, and I was raised really well, if it were any other guy instead of me, he would have walked all over your honor. Let’s forget what happened, remember, one thing only, you and I cannot get married. So don’t dare call me again. We’ll never meet again, take care, bye. Afnan, listen. 
Yes? I have to go to the office early tomorrow, please take me with you, okay? Okay. Sure. Listen, listen, listen. 
Yes? Aleezay, should we go out somewhere?
To hang out? Please. At this time? Is it prohibited to go out at this time? I’ve been getting bored for so long, there’s nothing good on TV either. Let’s do one thing, let’s go 
on a long drive. You know I could really use a
long drive right now, I’m getting suffocated staying 
at home like this. It feels like I’ll get sick. We’ll go out and sit in some 
open space, okay? And if you feel like it, 
we will eat something. Okay, let’s go. Thank you, go and get ready, 
I’ll also get ready. I’ll change and be back. 
Okay. What do you think, I’m not marrying you, because 
I am busy with my work? Yes. 
Have you gone mad? Have you lost your mind? How can you even think that 
I can marry you? It’s my mistake, it’s on me. I shouldn’t have kept a friendship with you,
but I had lost my mind, I thought she is an innocent girl 
who keeps getting in trouble so let’s help her but you… You are running after me. You even left your own parents 
to be with me, you didn’t even care about their honor, how would you uphold my honor? The one who isn’t loyal to her parents, won’t be loyal to me either. You have no idea about the importance
of relationships, Ramsha. You only care about you, 
your happiness. Thank God that it was me, and I was raised really well, if it were any other guy instead of me, he would have walked all over your honor. Hey, Ramsha? Ramsha? What happened? 
What happened, my child? Mother…
Hey, what happened? Mother. 
What happened? This Shani… Shani… Can I tell you something? This proposal is no less than 
a miracle for Ramsha. Once this wedding takes place, people will shut up. Because Nabeel’s mother herself called, she is willing to come over, 
she is offering a proposal, you shouldn’t delay it, 
invite them over. Ramsha? What happened, my child? Mother… What happened? Why are you crying? Mother, I’m really scared, really scared mother. What happened, my child? Ramsha? Why are you scared? Did someone say something to you? Did Shani say something? No, nobody said anything, 
I’m just really scared. Why, my child? Why are you scared? And what are you scared of? I’m getting scared of myself, 
I feel like I am terrible, like I’m really bad, I am getting 
terrified mother. My child…
I don’t feel good. No, my love, there’s nothing like that,
 it’s not like this, nothing like this, 
don’t think about it. You don’t know, mother. 
You don’t know what I just saw. I saw that I am really scary 
from within, and really bad, really dirty and I’m not good, mother, 
I’m terrible… No, my child. Look, you must have had a nightmare, I told you to recite the prayers
before sleeping, you must have forgotten about it, 
that’s why you are scared. It was a dream my child, 
nothing to do with reality. It was a dream, mother? 
Yes, my love. And I am here with you, you don’t have
anything to be afraid of. Mother. 
Mother? Don’t leave me alone, 
I am really scared, please don’t leave me. 
No, my child, how can I leave you? I am here for you. 
I am with you. Don’t be scared, 
I will sit with you, good job. Ramsha, that Sister Sabia… she has told me about some old man, I’m thinking of visiting him today, I’ll get an amulet for you too, the condition you were in yesterday?
I got really scared, I couldn’t see your condition. Listen? Did you talk to that man? Is he going to bring his family here 
for proposal or not? Did he say something? Ramsha? Mother, he left the country, I’m not in contact with him anymore. You can fix my marriage 
wherever you want. Ramsha. Many congratulations, the date is fixed for your wedding. 20th of this month has been decided. May God keep you very happy, always smiling and giggling. Are you happy? You are lying. Ramsha didn’t use to be happy like this, when Ramsha is happy, 
she screams with excitement, yells, she glows and most of all annoys me, and you did none of these. I told you. We have to change ourselves with time. No, Ramsha. Don’t change yourself, I like you how you are, laughing, smiling, always making noise, I like Ramsha like that. Come on, let’s celebrate this day, let’s make a nice video. No, Annie. I hate this phone. I don’t want to make any videos. How can you hate that? This is a mere unconscious thing, the mistake is ours, and we should know how to use things. You are right. I wish I understood it earlier. Mr. Qasim, I came to bother you. It is my daughter’s wedding. 
You must come. I am doing this wedding with simplicity. I have only invited selected people. May God bless. Congratulations. May God bless you in this life and 
afterlife and bless her with the best fate. Amen. But… I… I think I might be wrong, 
but you mentioned you don’t have any children. No, you must have misunderstood. I told you that I don’t have any son.
I only have one daughter. Yes, it might be so. Daughters are also the blessing of God. I will come for sure. 26th of the month. As far as I remember, I have to go to attend a meeting 
in Islamabad on that date but… But if I won’t go, then I will come 
for sure, God willing. Let me know if I can be of any help. Thank you so much. 
Let me go. I have to distribute some other cards. May God help you fulfill all the tasks. Thanks. Bye. Father, whose card is it? Greetings. Greetings. Sorry, father. Greetings first, then talk. Mr. Sajid, the one who makes 
the ration packets… It is his daughter’s wedding.
Okay, oh may God bless. Father, I going to see uncle Bilal. Let me know from where I should 
pick you on your way back. No, no. You go and come back 
home directly. I will take a while in the mosque. The construction work of Imam Sb. 
is almost done. Only a few things like 
sewage lines are left. Father, you have already done enough. What is the need to do more? 
I mean… The mosque owners have already 
given him the two rooms. It must be enough.
No, it’s not enough, son. He has a family, children… It’s not possible to live in a small home. And when we are capable to help them, so it is all about being honoured, right? It is his service, if we will also contribute a bit 
then there is no problem, right? Okay, father.
Whatever you think is right. I will leave now. Bye. Live long. Live long. Bye. Bye. May God bless girls with good fate, 
and in return, may He bless my daughter 
with good fate. Brother, it is a good thing that 
you are thinking like this. But what will I do after going there? I mean… These functions at small houses, there is so much noise there, brother. I can understand, Afsheen. It’s their daughter’s wedding, otherwise,
I wouldn’t have said yes either. He invited us with so much love
 and affection, if we will not go, it won’t look good. Brother, you are right. But I have not met that family as of yet, nor do I know any woman there. You can take Afnan there, right? Here you go, Afnan is here. 
He will go with you. Where to go? Dude, it is Sajid’s daughter’s wedding. Is the wedding today? No, no, it’s not today. You know I have to go to attend 
the meeting in Islamabad. So, I was thinking to give them 
the wedding gift at this time. I wanted to go give them the envelope.
It’s just that. But father, I am sorry.
I won’t be able to go with you. You know Fahad? There is an event 
at his home too, so… I wanted to go there. Okay. Your aunt says that there is too much 
noise in the functions at small homes, there is an event at your friend’s house, they are from lower class than us, right? It a wedding in an ordinary person’s home, so no one among you is interested. If it were an invite from an affluent person, so you would have been preparing for it 
a week prior to the event. That is because you would have asked them 
to do some of your work, right? Hey, I forgot that no one meets anyone without getting 
any benefit or purpose nowadays. Leave it, I will go on my own. Father? Father, listen to me.
Brother? Brother is just so kind to everyone. Even he doesn’t need to go there. If he wants to give them the envelope, any servant would have delivered it too. No, no, aunt. Father is absolutely right. Father is offended. 
I think I should go with them. I… I will go now. Bye. Father? There is no name plate here. How will we get to know that 
it is their house? Hey, he told me this same address that it’s the fourth house from the road 
and this black gate. It is the same. Yes, father. But don’t you have his number? Call and ask him. What is his name? Sajid. We knocked and rang the bell. Now let’s wait patiently, right? The order is to wait after knocking thrice. 
They will come in a while. Let me knock one more time. Here you go…
Who is… Greetings. Mr. Qasim, Mr. Qasim. An honourable person like you 
in my home… Thanks a lot.
I had to come, right? Thanks a lot.
Greetings. Come on in. Welcome.
Come, come. Come, son.
Come. Greetings. Thank you so much for coming. Come. Son, make him sit.
Greetings. How are you? Come here.
Greetings. Have a seat.
Thanks a lot. Have a seat.
Thanks. Have a seat. What is all this?
 Why did you bother? Hey, no, no. It is just… Hey? What was the need for this? 
It was enough that you came. Hey, there is indeed no need. But… She is our daughter. And daughters
belong to everyone, right? You just give this to my daughter 
as a gift from my side. Thanks a lot. You are coming to the wedding, right? Yes, God willing. I will try my best but I think I have a meeting 
in Islamabad so if it would be, I won’t be able to come. Otherwise, 
I would try my best. I should tell everything 
about Afnan to father. How can I marry anyone else? Where is my gift? Madam, the flowers that I brought, 
these are your gift. These?
Yes. I don’t need flowers. They will wither by tomorrow. Hey, wow. It is a fact, by the way. Sometimes, you speak very logically. These flowers will wither by tomorrow. Then let’s do one thing. 
I owe you your gift. Sure?
Sure. Where did you buy these bangles?
These are so nice. These are made of glass. Yes, what if they are made of glass? They are looking nice, right? That is amazing. 
Who likes bangles made of glass? You like them. I really like it when girls wear bangles. But they are looking so special 
in your wrists. Tell me already how did your day go?
I am not telling you. Okay, dude. Here you go. I have put the ice-cream aside.
I turned off the phone. Let me know how did your day go? 
What has happened? Ramsha? Where are you going? I am going to talk to father. I asked brother. There are so many guests outside. Well, don’t worry.
Let me go check outside. Then you can come, okay? I must talk to father. What are you doing here? Do you want to elope again? We would be further degraded. I am finding father. 
I need to talk to him. About what do you want to talk to him? You can talk to him as he comes inside. And can’t you do anything properly? What have I done? What did you do?
It’s your henna day today. You are going outside like this. Can’t you see how many guests are here? Go sit in your room silently. Talk to him when he would come inside. I want to talk to father. I will go inside 
after talking to him. Speak slowly. Go to your room. He will come inside. 
Then you can talk to him. Come on. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. May God help you fulfill 
all the tasks properly. Thanks a lot. Come on. No, no.
Hey, no. Hey, no, no.
Hey, brother Sajid??? You just come.
Thanks a lot. Greetings.
Come. Here you go. Drink the milk and drink it 
in front of me. Don’t leave it like you did yesterday. 
Come on. Mother, I will drink it in a while. Don’t worry. Tell me, who came to meet father today? Their voices sounded very familiar. Were they relatives? Don’t know, child. I didn’t see. Maybe they will be your father’s customers. They must have come to meet him. Hey? What are you doing? Wear them. You must not remove them till your wedding.
Come on. Wear them. Mother? I am getting so uncomfortable 
wearing these bangles and I will also change clothes 
after removing these. I cannot wear such heavy clothes 
and bangles in summers. No, child. Bangles look so good on brides’ hands. Do get ready after getting married. And you really like makeup. Do get ready properly. May God make you stay happy. How should I tell you, mother? I no longer long for anything. Will you also go to Fahad’s house? Yes, father. I told him I would be late. You can go after dropping me. Hey, no issues, father. I will drop you easily and will go then. And I will come back early too. Infact, let me call him. What happened? 
What are you looking for? I can’t find my phone. Oh. Father, I think I forgot my phone there. Well done. I am getting old, 
and you are forgetting things. Let me call Sajid. Your phone must be there. 
Just turn the car. Yes. Sorry, father. Mehnaz? Hey, where are you? Ramsha? Look someone forgot 
their mobile. Really?
Hmm. Okay. What happened, child? Father, a girl gave me this phone 
that someone forgot their… Hey, I am looking for this for quite a while. It is Mr. Qasim’s son’s mobile. Brother Sajid, Mr. Qasim is here. Yes, yes. It is Mr. Qasim’s son’s phone. You go, I am coming.
I need to give it to him.
