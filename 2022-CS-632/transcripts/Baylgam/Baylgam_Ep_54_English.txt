You didn’t remind me that I had to give you 
the wedding night gift. You look very pretty. I don’t know how long I have been
 waiting for this day. Your wedding gift. This is your wedding gift. Why are you acting so pious? Have you forgotten your past? I knew it, I knew very well about 
your shallowness. Yes, I am shallow, 
you got me absolutely right, and after the marriage, you will realize 
that I am not just shallow but very pathetic too because I have remembered 
everything and I will take revenge 
for each one of it. Once, just once say it to me that 
you don’t want to do this marriage, I will support you and stand by you. What is wrong with you, Afnan? What are you even saying? 
Why are you causing me hurt and pain? Whatever you are saying is 
causing me pain, Afnan, for God’s sake, just keep quiet and take me to the hall, it has already been so late, if we get late anymore, I will once again get dishonored 
because of you. I won’t let any of that happen, 
I promise, just say the truth once, just gather the strength and tell me, 
I will stand by you and Shani won’t be able to 
say anything to you, I… What has happened to you? 
Why are you saying all this? Why are you hurting me and 
causing me pain by saying all this? Because I want to marry you. Greetings dad. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Is everything okay? You look tired and your eyes are
 swollen too, are you feeling okay? Is everything fine? Yes dad, it’s just that I slept late at night, I couldn't sleep well so my head hurts. So you must sleep in time, if you will sleep well, you will stay healthy and feel fresh and I didn’t even see you at the prayers? Umm, I couldn’t wake up. You will wake up if you sleep in time. Look, the house has become so empty 
since Ramsha left. This girl came to our house 
for a few days and made a place in everyone’s hearts, she never made us feel like a stranger
by the way she used to talk and behave. Yes dad, some people are like that, who would gradually win
 everybody’s heart. Yes, some people are like that. Okay then come let’s have breakfast, 
Afnan. Afnan?
Yes? Come, let’s have breakfast, come. Come, good boy. Come in. Is it morning for the bride yet? Everyone is waiting for 
the bride downstairs, Mom is saying to call my daughter-in-law
for breakfast first. What happened Ramsha? 
Hmm? You are crying? No. You are crying. Did brother say something to you? I thought that brother’s heart would melt 
for you after marriage but he didn’t change his attitude, is that what you do to your bride? You shouldn’t have married brother. I will go and tell mom right now 
she will fix him. No. Annie? Don’t tell anything to aunt. I don’t want to make complaints and Shani gets mistrustful 
towards me. He is my husband now I want to make my place 
in his heart and I need support from you 
all for that. I am very happy Ramsha that 
my brother got a wife like you. God will definitely help you 
accomplish your purpose. Now fix your mood and 
come downstairs, please? Hmm? You haven’t cut the vegetables yet? It’s almost time for 
the guests to come, hurry up a little. Mom, why all these preparations? Are we expecting any guests? Yes, brother has thrown a feast 
for Ramsha. Feast for Ramsha? Why? That girl has left this house 
after so much difficulty now he will invite her for feats 
and call her back here? What can I say? He said that they have gotten married, they are new bride and groom and 
should be invited to the feast though I even indirectly told him that it is their own house and they could 
come without any invitation too but he specially called them 
to invite them. Mom, I don’t understand why is uncle always 
so worried for that girl. What do you mean? I mean to say that he is much more tense
about that girl than his own daughter-in-law? Why? Alizeh, there is nothing like that,
actually, brother always wanted a daughter and Ramsha has also taken 
a lot of care of brother, so that is why he made Ramsha 
his daughter. I used to tell you to take care of brother 
and give him time but you have always been busy
with your career and never gave time to home. Please Mom, I cannot put my career 
at stake for uncle. You say such old wives’ things 
sometimes. Anyway, this has all become a routine now, send coffee for me. Umm, what should I take out, 
Ramsha? Take out anything, Annie, 
I will wear it. This one, hey, why anything? You are a newlywed bride, 
wear something nice. If I were you, I would have worn 
a heavy dress, done dark make-up and would have 
worn heavy jewellery and I would have stayed dressed up
at home too. God forbid, you are ever in my place. I mean, why someone like Shani? May God give you a way better 
husband than Shani, who loves you a lot 
and respects you. Amen. You don’t get disheartened 
because of brother, he is habitual of spoiling things, he does that to mom and I, as well, 
he is always cranky, don’t worry because of her, you tell me what do you 
want to wear? This, umm, wear something red, 
this is a very dull color. What are you doing here? I was helping Ramsha to take out 
clothes for the dinner. Are you here to help her with 
clothed or provoke her? There is nothing like that Shani, 
what is wrong with you? Do you work and leave, come on. Ramsha, wear this one. What is this behavior? Wear the clothes and get ready. What is this behavior? I don’t understand 
what is all this going on? They invited just the bride and 
groom for the dinner, no one even asked us? Though according to the tradition 
whenever the parents’ family invites for dinner,
the entire in-law’s family is invited, you just don’t invite the boy 
and the girl. Anwar, this is her parents’ house, 
not that one. You should be grateful that brother Qasim
takes so much care of her. I thought something else. I thought that we had become 
Mr Qasim’s relatives so we will visit each other often, he loves her so much so he would
 do something at least. You are not relatives of Mr. Qasim 
but Ramsha, and it was before as well and 
what difference does all of this make? I don’t know why have you started 
to dream so big. And everyone invited the 
newlywed couple for dinners anyway, it doesn't mean we all should
 go with them, there is a limit. We are leaving. Go. 
Bye. Stay happy, you look very beautiful by the grace of God, 
protect yourself from evil eye. Okay, my child, you must go but if you can tell Mr. Qasim that whenever he invites you guys 
for dinner next time, he must invite us too. My child, it looks good that everyone
goes to dinner together, yeah? Go, stay blessed, stay blessed. I am going to go start the bike. 
Yeah. You look very beautiful 
by the grace of God, I will recite on you 
when you come back. Give my regards to everyone there and yes, tell Shani to 
ride the bike carefully. Okay, go. 
Bye. Bye, my child. It is the limit, by the way, what was the harm in 
inviting us as well? Actually, I had to go to the academy, I have just checked there was 
no driver here, so will you please call the driver 
and ask him to come? Ramsha, is there any specific time 
for you to go to the academy or do you just go there any time? The servants of this house are 
the servants of this house, they are not your personal assistants. Actually, I have a special lecture today so I am going to the academy 
at this time else I… Anyway, the driver is not here, if you want to go you can go 
in the auto-rickshaw. You were roaming around 
in cars, Ramsha, you forgot your place, and I am sure you must have realized your actual place now after sitting 
on this broken bike. You were flying so high, now it’s time to crawl on the ground. Greetings, madam Ramsha. Greetings, how are you? Yes, I am fine by the grace of God, 
are you fine? Shani? Umm you sit here, 
I will go check on uncle. Why? Can’t he come here to meet us? He wouldn’t know that we are here,
I will go check, you sit down. Greetings. How are you? I am fine. You came here on bike? Yes. Tsk, tsk, you could have asked your husband and he would have at least 
brought you here in a taxi, now look you have become 
habitual of roaming around in big cars while staying in this house. It must have been so difficult 
for you to come on a bike. You are not even used to it anymore. There is nothing like that, I have learned to change my habits 
according to the requirements and situations, thank God, and the ones who know to 
adjust to the situations, bikes, and cars don’t make 
any difference to them. Anyway, forget about all this, what did your husband gift you 
as a wedding gift? You didn’t remind me that I had to give you 
the wedding night gift. You look very pretty. I don’t know how long I have been
waiting for this day. Your wedding gift. This is your wedding gift. What happened? Why did you get quiet? Umm, he has given me a ring, ring is usually gifted as 
the wedding gift, right? Where is the ring? 
Tell me? I forgot it at home, today,
 I forgot to wear it. You are very careless, you couldn’t even take care 
of the ring for one day? Do you see this? Afnan gave it to me as a wedding gift, I haven’t taken it off ever since
 that day. Listen? I will be glad if you come here 
as a guest, you get what I am saying, right? I am going to meet uncle. I am so glad to see you here, the house has become so gloomy 
ever since you left. They say it right that daughters are the light 
of the house. You are right, uncle. I miss you a lot and tell me something, are you taking your medicines in time? I hope you are not slacking in your diet? Yes, I take all the medicines in time, you just keep on visiting and
I will be fine. Okay, uncle, I will come to meet you sometimes and
 you will come to meet me sometimes too. Okay? You will come, right? I will come too, if God wills. Okay its time for prayers, 
I will go offer prayers. Okay?
Okay. Stay blessed. Ramsha? How are you? I am fine. Are you happy? Yes, I am very happy. But your face doesn’t seem like 
you are happy. There is a smile on your face but sadness in your eyes and eyes never lie they tell the situation of the heart. Madam Ramsha, the food is served,
 you guys may come. Aunt, you had arranged so much, what was the need of this formality? I will tell you, actually they feel that 
we don’t get to eat all this that is why she got 
so many things made and I understand that all this is being 
done to brag it to me, and if you won’t brag it to me 
how will you degrade me? Shani, what is wrong? 
What are you saying? There is nothing like that. No, it is like that but 
you don’t understand. No, no my child, 
there is nothing like that. it is like that. We just expressed our love 
and affection towards you, if you disliked something, I apologize. Uncle? No, no, actually it is my fault that 
I came here on his invitation, because he just had one purpose, they had called me here to humiliate me
and degrade me, what else? Enough, Shani, For God’s…
What do you mean by enough? Don’t you see how they are 
humiliating me? If you have to be humiliated here 
and eat then you may eat! I am leaving. Let’s go Ramsha. I am really sorry, I am so sorry, forgive me. You have done so wrong, Shani. You shouldn’t have done all this, uncle has been so hurt because of you
and I was so embarrassed. What happened? 
You guys came so early? Ask him this, he has gotten me 
so humiliated over there. He brought me without even 
eating food, uncle has been so hurt 
because of his action. Shani? What is Ramsha saying? What is this behavior? What happened, after all? Nothing happened, 
nothing happened at all, no one said anything to him. Everyone gave so much respect 
and love, they made such good arrangements 
for food but… but he couldn’t digest the fact that why have they arranged 
so much for him? He thought they had made 
those arrangements to degrade him and he left from there and brought me 
along with him as well. I was so embarrassed in front of him, 
does he have any idea? Shani? What is this behavior? You went there for the first time and what have you done? Did you leave without eating? Mom, what have you cooked? Please serve the food. And come sit, let’s eat. You eat it, I don’t want to. Hey. Shani, is this the way to behave? 
What have you done? Mom, this is the way now they all will know what is Shani.
