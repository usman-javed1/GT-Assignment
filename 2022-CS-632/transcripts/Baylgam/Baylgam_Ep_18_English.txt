What are you doing here? I… Actually… I… When I said that this room 
will bever be opened, then how dare you open it 
without my permission? I guess you are forgetting 
that I am a mother, your could have become stone-hearted, but I cannot forget my daughter. I smell Ramsha from everything 
in this room. Don’t take her name in front of me, I don’t want to hear her name. And these, why are her clothes and 
her things here? Yeah? What are you doing? 
Remove them. What are you doing? 
These are Ramsha’s things. Enough! Stop throwing her things. The one who is not in this house,
her things shouldn’t be in this house too. She is dead for me and you cannot forget their memories if you keep the things of dead people 
close to them. Ramsha? Where are you Afnan? Your number has been busy 
for so long, I am even calling you, 
why aren’t you attending my call? Sajid, stop! Sajid, for God’s sake, stop! 
Don’t do it. Move. 
Dad? What happened? Dad, uncle is burning all Ramsha’s things. Burning things? Brother, brother, what are you doing? Stay away! If anyone comes close, I will burn myself instead. okay, okay no one will come close. Okay. For God’s sake, 
someone please stop him. Uncle, please, uncle. Okay at least listen, you talk a lot. I am standing at a bag store, 
do you want a bag or not? Yes, okay. Okay I am very bad at such things, I am video calling you, wait a minute, 
I am switching. Yes. yes, Afnan? What is it? Okay look at this. No, this one is not good, 
show me another one. Dude, you know it very well that
I hate coming to malls, I am coming to this mall for you 
for the third time. Afnan, show me a few more options,
 what is the problem? Look at this. It’s not good, show me more. Show me the one next to it. Here take your light. you brought it? 
you are so good, thank you. How is it even possible that my daughter 
demands something and I don’t fulfill it? Thankyou dad. What was the need to bring it? You fulfill her every demand, your love and pampering has spoiled her. Mrs, I just have one wife, if I wouldn’t even pamper her 
then will I pamper the neighbors? I am telling you that I was at friends, I was at her house, I am telling you the truth I am not lying… You should be ashamed of lying over 
and over again in front of everyone. You should be ashamed, you trust your friend and not me. You should die of shame, you got manipulated by your friend 
and doubted me. what if I maa not your sister, 
I am still your cousin, and cousins are like sisters too. Mehnaz, do tell Shani that not let his friends interfere
in my personal matters else I will be the worst. Sister in law, sister in law? Salma, my daughter bought all of this 
with so much love, she used to keep everything so safely and wouldn’t let anyone touch anything, everything has been burnt to ashes, 
everything has been burnt. Everything has turned to ashes, Salma, everything has turned to ashes. Ramsha, quickly bring the juice. Ma’am, this is a parcel for you. Happy birthday ma’am. Oh thank you. 
Welcome ma’am. Thank you so much. Here, your shake is ready. Oh wow, where did these flowers 
come from? Vicky has sent them. 
Wow, but what for? Don’t you know? Today is my birthday. Oh yes, happy birthday, may you have many many more. Thank you so much. 
And what’s in it? It has a cake. Wow, your boyfriend loves you a lot, you are very lucky by the way that you got such loving person. He wished you at exact 12. True. And… it’s his call. Hello? Thank you, thank you so much and I have gotten your surprise, 
I will open it in a while. Yes, yes, I will open it and 
let you know, okay? Okay. Okay. Bye. What was he saying? Vicky loves me a lot and he makes my every birthday 
so special. You are actually very lucky to get
 such a loving person. Thank you for this, but by the way, you tell me about yourself, I guess you even introduced me 
to your fiancé, then you told me something about him, 
I can’t recall properly right now. You find out all my secrets, 
tell me about yourself too. Forget all this, you will find out at the right time. And what is the rush? You open the cake I will quickly 
bring knife and the candle. Okay. He is an extremely disgusting man 
and such a jerk. What happened to you? Why did you come so early? 
And, and who is a jerk? Tariq Baig! What do they think that we will do what they say
and what they want? We have no self respect? You know he was getting frank with me
like I am his girlfriend or a wife. He has no shame, shameless! And I am not working with him ever again. Yes, yes, now you have become 
a huge star, you will decide yourself who you want to work with and 
who you don’t want to work with? Right? Ramsha, I told you earlier as well, you are new to this field right now 
and you have to compromise. This is your 5th day and you have 
already rejected 8 offers, and you know that is a big deal. Hania, everything cannot be compromised especially honor, I cannot compromise
 on my honor at all. I am not characterless and where are you going all dressed up? Vicky has arranged a get together 
to celebrate my birthday. Wow. I am getting a call. Asim… okay. Hello? Yes Asim? Umm, Asim actually I am a bit busy today, shall we plan something tomorrow? Yes, update the time and let me know, okay? Okay, bye. Vicky. Hello? Yes Vicky? Hey, why are you getting angry? I am absolutely ready, 
I was on call with Asim. Yes, okay, come, I am ready. Okay. Vicky is very possessive for me. If he finds out that I am busy on call he gets very angry and 
he loves me a lot. How cute. But what will you do alone at home? Come along with me, 
you will have a lot of fun. Are you sure? I mean, it won’t look awkward if I go there? I mean, he will think I came 
as an uninvited guest? Not at all, I am with you, just go and get nicely ready. 
Go, go, go. okay let me pick my bag. 
Okay. Okay I will go and quickly get ready. Okay, go. Idiot. What do you think that 
you will block my number and I will forget about my money? Hey why are you getting angry? I didn’t do it on purpose, 
it happened by mistake and I told you I will get you a phone. Just wait for a bit. I don’t need a phone etc, 
I just need my money that too all of 60,000, 
do you understand? Dude, I will give it to you, 
take it from me next week. Even last week you said the same thing
that you will return it next week. And if you think you can get away
with my money then you are mistaken, son. I will get my money out of 
your throat any how. Look, I am talking to you nicely, and you are showing me attitude, you couldn’t control the women 
in your house, someone took your cousin 
from your own hous…. Shut the hell up! I need my money back. wait a second Ramsha. You drink it. I am asking you to drink it. Hania?
Ramsha? He has added something to it. What did you add? Nothing, you have a misunderstanding. I am not having any misunderstanding, 
I saw you myself. What do you think of yourself? Don’t I know you? 
Before I slap the hell out of you, get lost from here, I am asking you to get lost. I will see you, I won’t spare you. Yes, yes, you can see me later. 
Get lost. Ramsha, relax. Relax. Come let’s go out in the lawn. Relax. I am with you, 
come. Let’s go. Hmm. Bye. You are still thinking the same, 
Ramsha, it keeps on happening here. Hania, I am just thinking that how people actually are and 
how they show themselves. Okay forget all this, let’s go to have an ice cream. No, let’s go home for now, 
I am tired, I want to go home. I want to fix your mood. 
Come with me now. Hania, what are you? You are something and then you are 
a different person the next moment. You don’t need to understand me. Oh my Lord! Nothing is hidden for you, you are aware of seen and unforeseen, my Lord! My Ramsha is naïve, don’t punish her for the foolish mistakes 
she did because of being naïve, protect her, she is far from us but not from you. My Lord! Protect her from all the hardships 
and difficulties. Oh God! Hania, you make me laugh so much that 
a person’s stomach start to ache. See, I told you that I know very well how to fix your mood. True that. By the way it was so much fun today, did you see that how much protocol 
Vicky gave me? I am just loving it. You are absolutely right, you are actually very lucky. Vicky loves you a lot. He must have a lot of sources. Forget all this, he was just… Let’s go. Why is he calling me? Who is it? I have an ex boyfriend, it was so difficult for me to get rid of him, he is after me again. Don’t worry, just take the call and 
tell him to not bother you ever again. Say it. One second. Okay? Hello? Yes Daniyal? Tell me what is it? This girl does forget something 
or the other. Let me call her. Idiot. Your dialed number is busy 
on another call, please wait.. Your dialed number is busy 
on another call, please wait.. Your dialed number is busy 
on another call, please wait.. Daniyal, hang up now, I will send it to you 
if I have her number because I have changed my phone 
and I don’t have her number, why do you keep on calling me 
again and again. Daniyal how many times have I told you that I don’t want to talk to you on this topic, I am very happy with Vicky and 
we are about to get married soon, then why do you, again and again…
 Umm, oh God! Vicky it was you, you scared me. Who were you talking to for so long? Umm, umm, Vicky, actually I… Tell him. What are you doing? 
Are you mad? Let’s leave from here Hania. He… You stay away from our matters, 
understand? Stay away, come on. You are betraying me? And what did you think that you will 
betray me and I won’t know? You are constantly talking to Daniyal. Even though I told you
thousand times not to. My friends kept on telling me
 like crazy to stop trusting such a girl 
but I was a psycho! Vicky, wait a second, okay? Look, it is not what you are thinking. Daniyal did call me… 
Do not… do not tell me rubbish! You were still talking to Daniyal… Look Vicky…
Yes, yes. Yes, Vicky, I agree I was talking to him 
but it is not what you think. I understand everything as to what is it 
that you are cheating on me, I trusted a girl like you. I went against my parents 
and proposed you. Look, Vicky, I agree but I haven’t done anything like 
what you are thinking, I am happy with you, I mean, 
how can you think like that? You have betrayed me! And you think I will spare you? I left my parents and trusted you 
and you left me? Tsk tsk, don’t worry at all, 
I won’t do anything, I won’t do anything, I will kill you. Hania? Hania? Stop him, 
what is he doing? Hania? 
Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? Vicky? No. Vicky, no, you won’t do anything like this,
I am telling you. Hania? Hania? Hania, Hania, get up.
 Hania, Hanai, is there someone who can help us.
 Hania, Hania, get up. Sir I am telling you the truth.
I haven’t done anything. Her boyfriend Vicky shot her 
in front of my eyes, he has killed her ruthlessly, 
I am telling you the truth. you have said the same thing 10 times. And you know the person that 
you putting such an allegation on? So, I am telling you the truth, 
I am not lying. Trust me. Take her, I will do the investigation. 
Yes sir. Look sir, listen to me. it is very important for you 
to investigate Vicky. He has killed my friend in front of my eyes,
ruthlessly, sir. He should get a very strict punishment, 
don’t spare him like that. We know what we have to do, we know our job better. Take this girl outside. Sir, listen to me. 
Come, girl, let’s go. If you call Vicky and investigate him, 
that will be better. Come, girl, And you are punishing me instead? 
come. I have spoken… Hey girl, stop the fake crying, now we know who has committed 
this murder. What do you mean by this? I? Why would I kill my friend? What is wrong with you guys? I have told you guys that her boyfriend 
Vicky has killed her in front of me, and despite of knowing everything 
you are still accusing me? Hey? Lower your tone, this is not your home. Else you will remember 
what I do to you. I am sorry, look, how can you put an allegation on me? I haven’t done this. This is not the reality, 
why would I kill my friend? I am telling you that’s not the truth, the ruth is that er boyfriend 
Vicky killed her in front of my eyes. Why don’t you understand? The court will decide the truth
and lie now. Okay fine, you bring me my phone,
