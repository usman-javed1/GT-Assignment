[23.48] What do you think? You will put allegation
after allegation on me
[26.28] and I will agree in front of everyone?
[28.04] That’s the issue with you,
[29.80] I come to talk to you, you scream, 
you misbehave.
[33.36] Why should I not scream?
[35.00] I will scream louder and tell everyone
that I cheated me.
[38.20] I cheated you, right? 
Then you do one thing,
[40.88] don’t live with me.
[47.64] But clearly tell me today,
[49.88] so that my mind will be clear and 
I will make arrangements for this.
[55.28] For God’s sake, 
you people be quiet.
[61.00] It is better that you make your 
daughter understand this.
[64.68] Mama,
[67.64] you still haven’t slept.
[70.44] You too are still awake.
[72.84] Yes, I was not sleepy.
[76.28] I know why you are not sleepy.
[84.88] Call Afnan, ask him 
where he is right now.
[89.56] If you think I am awake because 
I am worried for Afnan,
[93.12] then you are mistaken.
[100.76] It doesn’t matter to me, 
where he is.
[103.12] Alizay, Afnan went so upset,
[110.44] it is so late at night, it doesn’t matter 
to you where he is?
[116.16] When he doesn’t care about me at all,
then why should I care about him?
[131.88] I will try to sleep.
[154.76] I really miss dad.
[158.84] When dad was alive,
[162.08] no one would dare to misbehave 
with me so much.
[176.40] Whatever issue I had,
[180.76] dad surely had a solution for it.
[191.00] I didn’t know that after 
he passed away,
[195.88] I would face so much insult 
and humiliation.
[209.24] Do you know Ramsha,
[219.84] I was really young, 
when mama had passed away.
[225.64] Dad never let me miss my mother.
[238.28] Not just one father,
[241.08] in fact, he brought me up 
like a mother too.
[244.56] That is true,
[246.60] uncle knew how to live 
in relations well.
[261.72] I have learned from uncle 
how to live in relations.
[266.56] Yes,
[268.92] he really liked you.
[281.32] He really loved you a lot.
[289.80] I know Afnan.
[350.12] Aunt is calling.
[358.32] Pick it, Afnan.
[359.80] Those people will be worried for you.
[362.16] Let them be.
[363.52] I don’t want to talk to anyone.
[373.16] Afnan, look, they care for you. 
They are worried for you,
[376.72] that is why they are calling.
[377.64] Please pick up the call. 
Please, Afnan.
[387.40] hello.
[388.72] Afnan, me and Alizay are 
worried for you.
[392.72] Where are you?
[395.24] I am with a friend.
[404.68] When will you come back home?
[411.80] It is really late at night.
[422.60] Son,
[424.44] you are upset with the family, 
not with the home. Come home.
[428.16] Yes, fine. I will come.
[507.72] Why are you making an issue 
out of something so small?
[513.00] Alizay,
[515.08] I cannot tolerate this 
behavior of yours.
[518.08] I have been restless all night, 
I couldn’t sleep because of you.
[520.60] Hmm.
[522.00] You must not be able to 
sleep thinking of someone.
[525.32] What?
[528.68] I am disappointed,
[530.80] not with you, but with myself.
[533.00] In fact, I am disappointed at my love 
that till today I couldn’t prove to you,
[536.48] how sincere I am with you.
[538.20] I couldn’t make you believe 
till today that my love…
[540.44] Afnan, who was that girl?
[565.28] Afnan.
[568.60] When did you come?
[573.84] I came at night, at little late, but…
[580.96] I am going to the office right now. 
We will talk later.
[582.72] No, wait. I will have breakfast served.
[584.32] No, no, aunt. 
I am not hungry at all.
[587.76] Afnan, whatever Alizay did was wrong.
[591.56] I know that.
[592.96] I have scolded her a lot.
[602.76] And she is really embarrassed 
at what she did.
[611.84] Afnan, I know, Alizay is short tempered,
[615.84] but she is really good at heart.
[620.92] Fine aunt. I will go now.
[625.96] Who is that girl, Afnan?
[637.32] Alizay was saying that 
you have an affair with her.
[649.08] Is this true?
[653.60] No.
[662.08] I have no affair with her.
[672.96] And right now, this is the truth.
[675.56] Goodbye.
[693.24] Hello.
[693.96] Where are you Afnan?
[695.52] I am in the office. All okay?
[699.84] Yes, I actually had to go out.
[702.76] Brother took the car, and went, 
so I thought I would go with you.
[706.84] Oh no. I am really busy,
[708.84] I have back to back meetings.
[711.52] If you want, I can coordinate with 
the driver he will come to you.
[714.84] No, no, it is alright, 
I will manage.
[717.40] Goodbye.
[719.12] Hey, listen, come on, 
we have to go somewhere.
[721.40] No.
[722.12] Hey come, I will pick your bag too. 
Come quickly. Come on.
[724.24] Afnan. 
Come on. Come on.
[736.84] So she is responsible 
for it herself, Afnan.
[739.52] If she had gotten married to Shani,
[741.56] then she should have compromised 
and stayed with him.
[744.68] After all, Shani accepted her 
after so much happened.
[749.28] Or else, who marries such girls?
[765.00] What happened?  Why are you 
looking at me like that?
[767.76] You too rejected her.
[776.24] Yes,
[779.80] maybe that was the biggest 
mistake of my life.
[792.76] I will not tolerate you in my home 
even for a minute.
[795.56] Get out of here. 
Aunt, what are you doing?
[798.40] What happened to you?
Afnan, don’t interfere.
[800.64] I will not tolerate her in my home 
even for a minute.
[803.84] Aunt, this is not the time to talk about
these things. Please don’t do this. Please.
[807.20] No, Afnan,
[808.68] my brother left me and went 
because of her, I will not leave her.
[812.08] Aunt. Aunt, please.
[813.80] Everyone is looking, 
why are you creating a scene.
[815.92] Afnan, if it was in my control I would 
have handed her over to the police.
[819.48] Hey it is my greatness that I am not 
saying anything to her.
[822.96] Afnan, how will you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this home?
[827.92] Tell me. Take her out of this home.
[829.72] Aunt, come to your senses.
[831.76] You are not giving peace to dad’s soul 
by doing all this, you are hurting him.
[839.52] What do you think? You will put allegation
after allegation on me
[842.32] and I will agree in front of everyone?
[844.20] That’s the issue with you,
[845.92] I come to talk to you, you scream, 
you misbehave.
[849.56] Why should I not scream?
[851.16] I will scream louder and tell everyone 
that I cheated me.
[854.36] I cheated you, right? 
Then you do one thing,
[856.96] don’t live with me.
[863.60] But clearly tell me today,
[866.08] so that my mind will be clear and 
I will make arrangements for this.
[871.32] For God’s sake,
you two be quiet.
[877.00] It would be better that you make 
your daughter understand this.
[881.72] Call Afnan, ask him 
where he is right now.
[885.28] If you think I am awake because 
I am worried for Afnan,
[888.92] then you are mistaken.
[896.52] It doesn’t matter to me, 
where he is.
[898.84] Alizay, Afnan went so upset,
[905.88] it is so late at night,
[908.12] it doesn’t matter to you 
where he is?
[911.92] When he doesn’t care about me at all,
then why should I care about him?
[931.88] Please Afnan, think once more.
[937.20] Look, when you say these things,
[940.96] I am unable to understand you.
[953.72] What sort of a human are you?
[958.16] Even after knowing Alizay has 
hated you all her life.
[973.68] She tried her best to ruin you,
[979.08] still you are supporting her?
[989.16] What sort of a co-wife are you?
[992.24] Afnan,
[994.24] I am also a Muslim, 
along with being a co-wife.
[1007.40] And a Muslim is a well wisher 
of another Muslim.
[1012.60] Why does she not understand 
these things?
[1024.04] I fulfill all her responsibilities.
[1027.28] Afnan, some things take time.
[1038.04] One day she too will 
understand all this.
[1039.96] It will take some time.
[1042.12] You are mistaken.
[1055.12] What she didn’t understand 
in my love,
[1066.12] how will she understand it 
in my hatred?
[1071.24] Afnan, please, think once more.
[1075.00] That’s it,
[1077.16] I have made my decision,
[1080.28] I cannot live Alizay now.
[1095.32] I will not travel in two boats.
[1126.16] You keep this and 
this is for you Bashir.
[1132.60] Aunt, what are they all getting 
the prize for?
[1136.88] Congratulations, Afnan.
[1139.52] You are going to be a father.
[1145.36] What?
Yes.
[1152.28] Alizay?
[1207.80] Afnan.
[1210.20] How are you feeling now?
[1212.56] I am much better.
[1214.72] I gave you such a big good news
[1216.84] and you didn’t even congratulate you.
[1219.76] No, there is nothing like that.
[1221.80] Actually, the good news was 
so good that
[1225.04] I forgot in my happiness.
[1227.48] Congratulations to you.
[1231.60] Afnan, do you know
[1233.60] when I used to think of a child earlier,
[1236.44] I would feel we should wait a little 
and then plan a family.
[1252.40] But,
[1253.96] now when God has given me 
good news, I really like it.
[1274.00] What is the matter, Afnan?
[1277.16] Are you not happy?
[1280.40] No, no, I am really happy.
[1284.20] Really, really happy.
[1297.24] I was just thinking that
[1299.56] now you would really have to care 
about your health. Okay?
[1349.08] madam, what is this for?
[1351.32] Hey, I am going to get such a 
big happiness in my home.
[1356.88] May God protect younger madam 
and her future child.
[1359.72] May God give them a son.
[1362.00] Amen.
[1363.04] Just pray that whatever God gives them 
is safe and sound
[1369.44] and may my daughter not get 
anyone’s evil eye.
[1372.76] All will be well.
[1377.60] Yes, madam, did you call me?
[1379.60] Yes, go get two goats.
[1384.12] One for my daughter, 
one for the future child.
[1387.04] I want to do charity for both of them.
[1389.68] Here you go.
[1391.64] Yes, sure.
[1417.08] Alizay.
[1419.28] Alizay, child, how many times 
have I called you?
[1423.28] Come on, food is getting cold.
[1426.52] Mama, I don’t feel like eating food at all.
[1429.12] In fact, I feel really heavy.
[1431.88] Oh my love, this happens 
in this condition.
[1434.60] It is nothing new.
[1435.96] But this in no way means that 
you stop eating.
[1439.56] Afnan, make her understand.
[1441.76] Yes, aunt, I make her understand. 
But she doesn’t listen to me.
[1446.00] You got the chance to get after me.
[1448.56] Now if you quit eating then 
your health will be affected.
[1450.64] Come, I will take you. 
Okay. Okay, I am coming.
[1453.88] Come on.
[1467.44] Did you talk to Alizay?
[1481.48] She must have created a big scene, 
Afnan.
[1493.52] I was even waiting for you yesterday 
that you will visit or call.
[1507.36] When you didn’t call I had an idea 
Alizay would have created a scene.
[1513.56] I didn’t talk to Alizay about anything.
[1516.00] I couldn’t talk to her.
[1518.76] Why?
[1529.64] You had gone to talk to her, right?
[1537.24] At times nature changes your life 
and decisions in an instant.
[1551.96] I went to tell Alizay that 
I cannot live with her now, but…
[1567.36] but that one moment 
changed my life.
[1578.64] Ramsha, Alizay is pregnant.
[1596.16] Maybe nature wants that 
I stay with Alizay.
[1610.92] You know well, Ramsha,
[1615.28] I really desire a child.
[1627.92] Now I cannot leave Alizay.
[1638.56] I cannot take her out of my life.
[1664.04] Fine, Afnan, if you have made a decision, 
you would have made it after thinking.
[1685.92] Go change, I will serve food.
[1845.24] Hi Alizay. 
Hi.
[1846.84] How are you?
[1848.00] I am fine. You tell me. 
Did you come alone?
[1850.16] Didn’t aunt Afsheen come?
[1851.64] Man, mama is at home, 
I came directly from the office.
[1854.20] Okay, come on, 
let’s go. Come.
[1859.00] Ramsha.
[1860.36] You know her?
[1862.12] Yes.
[1863.80] How are you?
[1871.48] Ramsha, you are here?
[1873.60] You live here?
[1882.52] Yes.
[1884.36] How is Adeel?
[1886.00] Is he taking care of you?
[1893.08] You people talk, 
I will go inform mama.
[1896.08] Okay.
[1903.84] Ramsha, I had to give you good news.
[1918.40] I am expecting.
[1932.40] The reason for telling you is that
[1934.44] whether Adeel cares for you or not,
[1937.60] you cannot come back to our home.
[1950.48] After all, you are divorced
[1952.08] and even after your divorce he is taking
so much care of you.
[1955.40] He married you.
[1966.76] It is also your responsibility to ensure 
that your home remains.
[1980.24] Look, the relation between me and 
Afnan is going to get stronger,
[1991.60] there is no place for a third person.
[1995.28] You understand 
what I am saying, right?
[2018.72] Hey, you people are still 
standing here?
[2020.32] Come on. Come upstairs. 
Yes. Okay, take care.
[2059.96] Afnan, you took long to come 
from the office today.
[2063.88] Yes, aunt, I have a lot of work 
in the office,
[2067.88] that is why I get late.
[2073.20] Yes, I can understand.
[2079.20] After brother left, you have managed
the office, home, everything well.
[2097.60] Mama, I forgot to tell you. 
I met Ramsha today.
[2109.96] Should I bring water?
Water…
[2111.00] No, no, it is okay.
[2117.00] where did you meet Ramsha?
[2122.88] I went to meet my friend,
[2124.72] she lives in her apartments 
with her husband.
