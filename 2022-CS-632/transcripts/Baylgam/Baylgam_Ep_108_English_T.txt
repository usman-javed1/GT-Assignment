[100.48] Alizeh, you getting worried wouldn’t help,
my love.
[104.92] Mom, how should I not worry?
[113.40] Ramsha will give a son to Afnan
and I will get a daughter,
[123.40] that way, Ramsha’s value will increase
in front of Afnan.
[135.40] Ramsha will be called the mom of a son.
[139.20] What are these superstitious things
you are talking to me?
[148.40] Okay, tell me one thing,
[150.32] has Afnan ever said something
like this to you,
[159.00] that I want a son or a daughter?
[163.88] No, he has never said anything like that.
[167.24] End of story then,
[174.00] if Ramsha’s aunt even said
something like that,
[176.32] it wouldn’t make any difference.
[184.52] Whatever God wants, will happen.
[191.76] Alizeh you should pray that
God bless you with a healthy baby,
[197.04] that’s it.
[207.24] There is no need to worry,
just relax.
[223.44] I wanted to give Afnan
the happiness of a child,
[227.12] but now he will also have a child
from Ramsha,
[233.20] this girl has ruined my
entire happiness.
[236.40] What are you saying, Alizeh?
[238.20] You will be the one who gives
the first child to Afnan.
[242.16] I am telling you there is definitely
something wrong,
[245.96] she is definitely doing
some black magic
[250.20] that is why whatever she wants,
happens.
[254.04] God knows what is the truth,
[256.72] but I have seen that she is very
punctual in offering prayers,
[261.24] she doesn’t let any prayer
go unoffered,
[263.84] I guess that is why God answers
all her prayers.
[520.00] Afnan,
[524.76] may I ask you something?
[528.28] Sure?
[533.24] Do you want a son or a daughter?
[547.92] What is this question?
[556.76] All of this is in God’s control, 
not ours.
[566.84] We will happily accept whatever 
God blesses us with.
[571.92] But every person has some wish,
[581.68] what do you wish for?
[583.80] A son or a daughter?
[586.96] My wish, is just a healthy child.
[596.08] I just pray
[598.56] whether God blesses us with 
a son and a daughter,
[602.48] I just hope they are complete
[611.84] and they have a good fate.
[622.36] However,
[625.92] I do have a wish
[631.84] that if I have a son,
[636.40] I will name him after my father,
[649.40] Qasim.
[657.68] It means that you wish for a son.
[667.64] Look Afnan,
[670.08] I haven’t given you any responsibility
 that you cannot take,
[674.12] I have tried to bring you ease,
[679.00] after the demise of your mother,
[685.04] I have fulfilled my responsibility 
as a father,
[693.16] with complete honesty.
[698.72] Dad, you are absolutely right, 
you have always...
[703.04] you have always taken care of me 
with full honesty,
[707.84] you are a very good father.
[772.56] That’s very good news, Aunt,
[774.88] yes, yes, all of us will definitely come,
if God wills.
[777.44] Okay, listen,
[779.04] please make me talk to Annie 
as soon as she comes.
[782.12] Okay Aunt, take care of yourself.
[783.84] Bye.
[787.40] Afnan? 
Yeah?
[788.56] It was Aunt’s call,
[790.80] she was telling me that it is Annie’s 
Henna ceremony tomorrow
[792.28] and they have invited all of us.
[804.20] She was saying it with so much love that
she would be glad if all of us would come.
[816.12] What happened, Afnan? 
What are you thinking?
[825.92] Afnan, you will go, right?
[829.44] I don’t think we should go there.
[841.00] Look, I know very well that
[843.64] you are very close to them,
[846.20] but whatever happened 
because of them in this house,
[853.44] do you really think people won’t talk
 if any of us go there?
[866.52] Please call them and 
make an excuse,
[877.24] we cannot go there.
[997.88] Dude, I won’t be able to 
take you shopping,
[1000.36] do one thing, go with Aunt, look
[1003.40] you guys take very long in shopping
[1005.24] and I have a lot of work at the office,
 I will be busy.
[1007.60] By the way, I am going shopping 
with Mom only,
[1010.04] going with you means that 
we have to come back quickly.
[1017.60] Shopping cannot be done 
in an hour.
[1020.68] Dude, shopping actually gets 
done in an hour,
[1023.24] you women take very long.
[1029.60] Okay may I go now? 
Yes, take this card.
[1034.88] Thank you. Bye.
[1036.48] Bye, I am going as well.
[1039.80] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[1042.16] Are you going somewhere?
[1043.56] Yes, I am going to the office, why?
[1045.08] Umm, Annie called,
[1048.08] her wedding events are starting, 
today is the Henna ceremony,
[1055.84] she said she will get upset 
if I don’t attend it.
[1066.68] If you may allow, 
may I attend Annie’s wedding?
[1075.84] I won’t demand anything 
from you after this
[1078.96] and Aunt will even get upset 
if I won’t go,
[1081.68] please try to understand.
[1089.28] This is the last demand,
[1090.84] I won’t be stubborn about 
anything after this.
[1094.16] It means, you won’t listen to me.
[1096.20] I will,
[1097.28] just let me go today for the last time, 
please.
[1099.88] Okay fine, fine.
[1108.28] I will ask the driver to take you 
but come back in time.
[1112.04] Thank you so much, Afnan.
[1113.76] You’re welcome.
[1120.88] I am very embarrassed.
[1124.08] I should have believed you,
[1131.04] I should have trusted your character,
yourself,
[1134.56] and everything.
[1143.84] But just give me one last chance,
[1150.48] try to trust me this time,
[1160.00] I won’t break your trust.
[1187.76] Ramsha?
[1188.80] Greetings, Aunt. 
Greetings,
[1192.36] my child, you got so late I have been
waiting for you for so long.
[1195.64] I am so sorry, Aunt,
[1196.84] there was so much traffic,
don’t even ask.
[1201.64] Where is Annie?
[1202.64] Annie is getting ready.
[1204.72] I will go look after your Uncle,
[1207.04] he has been roaming around in the same 
clothes since morning doing house chores,
[1210.28] he hasn’t even gotten ready, 
there is a lot of work
[1212.40] but that doesn’t mean you should 
roam around like this,
[1213.72] he doesn’t care that 
guests are coming.
[1216.36] You know Uncle has always 
been like that,
[1219.48] if he has some work, 
he prioritizes his work first
[1222.72] and then would do anything else.
[1224.28] Don’t worry, he will get ready. 
Yes.
[1226.32] By the way, the house looks 
very beautiful,
[1228.52] you guys have done a very 
pretty set up.
[1230.40] Yes, it looks very beautiful, 
Shani’s friends have done all this.
[1234.16] I stopped them so much told them 
to just do a normal setup,
[1237.40] there was no need to do anything 
very expensive.
[1238.88] But Shani said, Mom, 
it is my sister’s wedding,
[1241.52] there shouldn’t be anything lacking.
[1243.80] By the grace of God, my son has become
very intelligent and responsible, right?
[1249.04] Okay, I am going to go sit there 
and wait till Annie gets ready.
[1250.92] Yes, come, I will go check 
on your Uncle as well.
[1294.24] You look so beautiful, 
by the grace of God.
[1296.68] Thank you.
[1297.96] You have come, Ramsha,
[1299.64] I wouldn’t have sat for my ceremony, 
hadn’t you come.
[1302.68] I knew it, that is why I have come.
[1309.36] You look very beautiful, 
by the grace of God,
[1311.36] you look like a doll.
[1313.28] Thank You, Ramsha,
[1315.24] I couldn’t get anything,
so I wore this,
[1317.36] do you have any other jewellery?
[1318.80] I don’t have it.
[1326.44] You should have told me 
earlier Annie,
[1334.20] I have so much jewellery
[1336.28] I could have brought 
something for you.
[1338.08] You can’t go, but brother can, 
brother will bring it.
[1346.36] Okay,
[1347.36] you call Shani and ask him to go to 
my home I will call Aunt Afsheen meanwhile.
[1350.72] Okay, okay.
[1398.40] Mom, what is this?
[1400.88] Actually, Shani’s sister is getting married
[1405.20] so Shani is here to get 
Ramsha’s jewellery.
[1413.12] Oh,
[1416.44] by the way, if there was a shortage 
of money at your end,
[1418.48] you could have just asked Mom.
[1429.56] Mom is very generous with 
charity for all such things.
[1435.52] That is not needed.
[1439.20] That’s strange,
[1440.72] accepting charity would have been 
better than begging.
[1450.84] Yes, Alizeh is right by the way
[1460.60] and you have made a 
huge sacrifice anyway,
[1471.60] after all your ex-wife has lived here,
[1474.00] and spent time here,
[1481.40] so this is your right.
[1486.16] You must mind your tongue.
[1493.76] I am standing in your house 
that doesn’t mean
[1495.88] you can say whatever you want to.
[1516.28] Hey, what did mom say?
[1518.12] She is right, 
she is just stating the truth.
[1531.44] Now, you guys have married Ramsha 
in this house
[1534.36] so you can take advantage 
out of it, right?
[1539.68] Actually, you still haven’t 
understood us,
[1542.88] we don’t make relationships based 
on richness and poverty,
[1552.92] we are poor but not shameless.
[1555.40] Oh, oh, you are so shameful,
[1565.48] you would have been shameful had 
you kept your cousin locked in 4 walls
[1577.64] instead of leaving her to have an affair 
with married men at other people’s homes.
[1590.12] What? What are you doing?
[1593.44] If you say a word more about 
my family,
[1596.68] I won’t spare you and would 
cut your throat!
[1599.84] What? What is he doing?
[1601.28] I feel like slaughtering her here but
[1608.40] I have just stopped my hand 
because of Ramsha.
[1611.40] Put this down, 
it can hurt her.
[1619.32] You can take whatever 
you want from this house,
[1621.48] we won’t say anything
[1626.24] but put this down, please.
[1628.80] Please.
[1652.88] Mom, who is this animal kind of a man?
[1654.76] Call the police,
[1657.16] don’t let him go.
[1739.68] Take me with you to Dubai,
[1742.76] look Shani,
[1744.44] take me with you,
[1746.44] I want to live with you,
[1751.48] we will start a new life there
[1755.20] and it will just be you and me in that life
[1758.64] and no third person,
[1760.64] we will leave all the bitterness of 
the past and regrets here.
[1765.88] We will start a new life,
[1769.44] I want to live with you,
[1772.16] I want to spend my life with you Shani.
[1777.00] Ramsha, are you mad that I should 
take you to Dubai with me?
[1781.24] I can’t tolerate you here, 
I don’t want to see your face,
[1784.24] that is why I am going to Dubai and 
you are asking me to take you with me?
[1794.64] It has been so long since 
we are married,
[1798.32] you didn’t love me even for once 
in all this time?
[1804.36] You don’t deserve to be loved,
[1812.24] yes,
[1813.92] I am right, no one would like 
to accept you,
[1819.40] you should be thankful 
that I married you,
[1823.24] else no one would have asked you.
