Alizeh? Alizeh? Please,
what are you doing, dude? I am already very worried, Alizeh,
for God’s sake don’t do this else I will get mad. you have made me mad, Afnan. You brought that girl here first, had an affair with her, married her and now you want to keep her
here again on my head. What do you think Afnan, I will quietly watch the show here? Not at all! I am not a disgusting illiterate girl
like Ramsha, I know my rights. I am not dependent on you… you.. Alizeh, please, please
you can’t do this, Alizeh. I cannot let you go like this Alizeh, especially not in this condition at all,
you are my responsibility. Just think how will you even go out
in this condition? If not about me or yourself,
at least think about our baby, how will he get affected. Did you think about our baby when
you were doing a second marriage? So then why should I think? You can be a father and
still be this selfish then why can’t I be selfish
being a mother, Afnan? Okay so that means
you won’t listen to me? So, then I am helpless,
I will have to go talk to Aunt and involve her in all this,
you will get controlled by her. Af… Aunt?
Afnan, stop. Aunt, I have no other way except
bringing Ramsha into this house. I know I got married by my choice, this is very wrong with Alizeh but Aunt, I am the only person who has been
the most affected by all this. If Alizeh can forgive me, there should be no other reason
except my health. My health is deteriorating
day by day, I am unable to focus on business, the whole business is suffering loss. I don’t understand what should I do. Sometimes I think,
if dad was alive today, I wouldn’t have been in
so much trouble, he might have done something
to bring peace in my life. But I beg you, Aunt, you are the elder in this house, make Alizeh understand else we can suffer damage
that will never be repaired. It will be better for all of us. Alizeh, Afnan is not wrong, look what had to happen, it did, I have never seen Afnan this worried. Try to understand Afnan, look God forbid, if something 
happens to Afnan, you will regret a lot. Mom, but what have I done 
wrong in all this? My love when am I saying 
that you are wrong? I am just trying to tell you that what had to happen,
has happened now you should support Afnan, and then Afnan is my only nephew the last symbol of my brother, if something happens to Afnan, I will never forgive you. My good daughter, prove to be a good wife. you have done wrong 
with my daughter. I don’t get it myself that 
what is happening with me. the ground is feeling 
insufficient to me. Since Dad has left, all the happiness and ease have
 gone away from my life. It feels like I have just gotten alone. Look her blood pressure 
is very high, I am prescribing some medicines
 for her for now, just give her regularly and 
we will recheck after a week. Okay fine. take this. Okay Doctor. 
Thank you. How is she feeling now? Her BP is a little high but she will be fine if God wills. It is normal in such condition. You guys sit. I know you are upset with me, and I even know the reason behind it. How can a woman tolerate her husband’s second wife 
to come live in her home. But Alizeh, to be honest, I am helpless. I am the reason you have become 
helpless, Afnan, because of this child you are helpless 
to keep me with you. No, it’s not that, I said all of this out of anger and I am really sorry for that. It is true that because of our child, your importance has increased 
in my eyes but it is not true that only because 
of this child I want to live with you. You are my wife Alizeh, and our marriage was my love marriage. I have loved you a lot and before becoming my wife 
you were also my friend, I used to share all my feelings
 with you. Even today, I am doing the same even today, Alizeh. Alizeh, you have so many 
relationships with me that no one can break them 
even if they want to, I know because of me, there have been problems 
in our relationship, trust me Alizeh, I am helpless because of my heart. I can only request you to understand my problem and support me. Ramsha, I have asked Jamshed to bring 
all your stuff here but let me know if there is anything left,
I will get it. Yes, there is something left. Really? What is left? Your love. The love for which you took me 
to that house, I want that love and respect 
from you Afnan that you promised to give me for life. Umm, I... I am going out with Alizeh. You can have food, 
I will have it outside. Why have you kept these 
Wedding pictures with you? Because it is our pictures… So? What do you want? Do you want to use them 
against me as well? You have kept them so 
you can blackmail me, like you got our shopping video viral, you will do the same with Wedding 
pictures too, right? Why would I do that? Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife. You got our video viral so people can 
get to know about us, and now you will get these Wedding 
pictures viral so everyone can know 
we are married, but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once, what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha? I have always gotten ditched 
by trusting you. Why are you doing this, Afnan? I don’t trust you anymore, Ramsha, not at all, and where there is no trust, 
there is nothing at all. Whatever has already happened, 
nothing more than that can happen now. The only sad part is that our marriage is not taking place 
because of our love but because of that ugly stain, you put on my character, I have to fulfill this relationship 
because of that today. Afnan, why don’t you understand that 
whatever has happened is not my fault? Whatever happened shouldn’t 
have happened but from now you are my honor, and try to not compromise 
my respect at least this time. Afnan? Afnan, come quickly. Yes, come let’s go. How do I look? You look very nice. Does this color suit me? Yes, it suits you a lot. Actually Afnan, we are going out 
together after so long so I thought of wearing something
 you would like. That is what you have always done, you have always cared about 
what I like and dislike. You are a very good wife. Shall we leave, 
aren’t you getting late now? Let’s go. 
Let’s go. shall I open it. No, you have to keep your eyes closed. What are you doing?
 May I open them now? No. What are you doing Afnan?
May I open my eyes? What? Open them now. How do you like it? What was the need for it, Afnan? Why wasn’t it needed? Your mood got so off 
because of me today, I thought I should get you a gift 
to make it up to you. I know you love me a lot 
but I am absolutely fine, nothing has happened to me,
it is just a matter of few days, everything will get back to normal 
that is why, you must go from here. No, no, no, I won’t go anywhere 
from here, Afnan, I can’t leave you and 
go anywhere, I will stay close to you and 
take care of you and all this has happened because
of me anyway, Afnan. How has this all happened 
because of you? I gave you so much tension and because of me 
you met an accident. I want to live near you. Ramsha, don’t hold yourself 
responsible, nothing has happened to me, 
I am absolutely fine. Everything will be like before 
in a few days. You are the one who says, there is always God’s expedience 
in everything. Afnan? 
Hmm? It was so much fun after so long, today, we went for an outing after so long. Did you like it? Hmm. , I have my doctor’s appointment tomorrow,
will you come along? Do one thing, get an appointment and 
let me know I will come from the office. Okay I will do that. Umm Alizeh, you must go
and rest now, I will come in a while. Why? Where are you going? To Ramsha? Yes, Alizeh, I have to look after her as well.
