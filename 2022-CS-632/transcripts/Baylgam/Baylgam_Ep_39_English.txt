There is no order to get a girl 
married without her will. You are just like my daughter. Just like I will ask my daughter for her will,
I will also ask you. What is the matter? 
Tell me, what is the issue? Now I will have to trust someone
 in your matter, then why not Shani? He is family. Look child, forget whatever happened. If you marry Shani, you will stay here in front of my eyes. Shani’s proposal coming after whatever
happened is a big blessing, child. What have you done, Alizeh? You went and returned the ring. Afnan told me you broke the engagement 
and came back. He was absolutely right, and I should have done this 
a long time back. What is this? Are you people children that
 you fight on small things. And who breaks the engagement 
in the fight? Mama, I didn’t start fighting. 
Afnan started fighting. He has no manners to talk, he started screaming at me
as soon as I came. I am not his maid. I don’t know what he thinks of himself. He is insulting me in front of the servants. I will not marry such a person. Whatever it was, you shouldn’t have
 broken the engagement. Here, I am preparing for your marriage
with Afnan and you went and 
broke the engagement. If you had any issue with Afnan, 
yo should have spoken to me. Stupid girl. I don’t want to marry him. What? Are you speaking the truth? Madam Ramsha, 
I am saying the right thing. Last night, sir Afnan and 
madam Alizeh fought a lot. Rasheeda was saying that 
madam Alizeh broke the engagement and she even returned the ring. Mr. Afnan is really angry. Elder sir and elder madam 
are really worried. Let’s see what happens now.
Let’s see what happens next. Brother, I have tried talking to Alizeh, but she is not listening to me. I feel that we should give 
both of them some time. Yes, so that they fight more, and the thing that is in the home right now,
 should first reach the neighbours and then it reaches the relatives. Do you want that 
what the servants saw today, the relatives also see it? They don’t understand 
the delicacy of the matter. Brother, right now there is not just 
a need to make Alizeh understand, but we also need to make 
Afnan understand. I mean, you know the young generation of today. Have they ever accepted 
their mistake till now? Afsheen, if Alizeh had an issue with Afnan, then she should have spoken to me or you. They can break relations like this themselves? This means, the children have grown up so big that they will break a relation when they want, 
they will form a relation when they want. Meaning, what the elders say has 
no importance in their eyes. You are absolutely right brother, I have scolded Alizeh. Give me some time, 
I will talk to her, because right now she is not willing 
to listen to me. Well done. When she is not ready to hear 
anything from you, then what will she understand? The children have made a joke 
out of relations, this is the limit. Greetings. Greetings. Dad, you are still awake? Afnan, I have been seeing 
for the past few days you have been coming home late. Now don’t say that there is a lot of 
work load in the office. I spoke to the guard and 
also the security officer. When the office is empty and closed, 
you still sit there for long hours for no reason. Did you talk to Alizeh? There is no point talking to her dad. She is not ready to hear anything, nor is she ready to understand anything. Goodnight. Greetings. Greetings. Dad, did you call me? Yes, Afnan, I wanted to talk to you about 
something important. Dad, I have a really important meeting 
with Mr. Ahmad, I am already late. If you want, we can talk comfortably at night. Sit. Sit here. Comfortably. Look, I am really worried for the child, 
Ramsha. I was thinking about her and see, I feel I am the reason for her
 being alone is me. I have seen that child, she has stayed here
for so many days, she is really sensitive. Dad was the important thing you wanted 
to discuss? Sorry, I am getting late for the meeting… I am not done yet, Afnan. Look, I have thought a lot about 
Ramsha last night, and my heart wants to do something for her.
Something, that can give comfort to my heart,
so that I can be satisfied. So, you marry Ramsha? Dad, just cause Alizeh has said no 
to marrying me, does this mean, 
I will marry any girl? No, dad, no. Are you even thinking 
what you are saying? What do you know about that girl? Who is she? What family has she come from? Is she speaking the truth or 
if she is lying. There is nothing and you asking your only son 
to marry her? You want to do something for her, 
right, dad? Then give her some money or give her a suitable place to stay, 
but forget about me getting married. Please. You are right, Afnan, I don’t know her. But all the days she has stayed her, son, I saw no flaw or bad habit in her. Just because you didn’t see a bad habit or 
flaw in her, then it doesn’t mean she has no flaw. You don’t know her. Do you know her from earlier? Speak up. No dad. I don’t know her and neither 
do I want to know her. She is not worthy of me. I will just say this to you that forget the thought of this from your heart, 
it would be better. I will not marry her under 
any circumstances. I will talk to Alizeh. I will make her understand, 
I will convince her. Even if she still doesn’t get convince, 
still… still I will not marry Ramsha. Goodbye. Goodbye. I am sorry, dad. I know you must not like it. I have always listened to you. But this time I cannot agree to this. Goodbye. I got so defamed because of 
that action of yours. My father couldn’t tolerate this, 
he just couldn’t. that shock took away my father. Whatever happened with my mother 
is all in front of you Afnan. I have lost everything 
in my love for you, and what did you lose? Nothing. Nothing, Afnan. What is wrong with you? What tone are you using with me? No matter what tone 
I am using with you, why are you not answering 
a question for me? When I had told you not to go to 
Salman’s birthday, then why did you go? Why are you constantly saying the same thing,
that you had said no. so what if I went? What do I do now? And tell me right now, do you want to do this 
after marriage too? Yes, this is what I have to do, 
and this is what I want to do. And you will have to listen to me. 
You can do what you want. Yes, so fine, you want a slave and not a wife, and I cannot be a slave. 
Keep your ring with yourself. Look, I am really worried for the child, 
Ramsha. I was thinking about her and see, I feel I am the reason for her 
being alone is me. I have seen that child, she has 
stayed here for so many days, she is really sensitive. My heart wants to do 
something for her. Something, that can give comfort
 to my heart, so that I can be satisfied. So, you marry Ramsha? Sir, Mr. Ahmad is here. Sir, are you going somewhere? What do I say to Mr. Ahmad 
about the meeting? Tell him the meeting will be rescheduled. I will tell him when it will happen. Okay. Why did you come here, Afnan? To meet you, to talk to you. Come on, sit in the car, we will talk. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything. This is my office, 
I come here to work. You go home. Fine, you don’t listen to me, 
I wont listen to you. I too will stand here and I will not let you go inside. 
You do your work. Afnan, please don’t create a scene here. Alizeh, I am not creating a scene, 
you are. I am just standing here. 
You want that I create a scene? Hey, greetings. Sit in the car. Hmm. Sorry, Alizeh. It is okay. But Afnan, have you not started to get
a little too short tempered nowadays? What is wrong with you? What do I tell you? I am going through a bad time. I shouldn’t have gotten upset with you
and I didn’t want to get upset, but, you know, I do what 
I don’t want to do nowadays. Okay, I am your cousin, 
I understand all this. Why were you screaming at Ramsha? I feel you have some old enmity with her. Where did Ramsha come 
in between us two? Leave this. Now end it. And yes, you too shouldn’t have suddenly
 put the ring in my hand. Does anyone do this on 
something so small? yes, so? You too were screaming at me
 in front of the servants. What about that? Okay, I am saying sorry. Are you doing me a favor 
by saying sorry? I am not doing any favor. I cannot live without you, 
that is why I am saying it. Okay come, wear this ring, or should I put it on with 
my own hands. No, there is no need for that, 
I will wear it myself. I am telling you, I misbehaved. It is different that you also 
misbehaved later. But till the time I don’t put this on 
with my own hands, my heart will not be at peace. Alizeh, some clothes have come 
for your wedding. Have a look, there are a few things 
in them, wear what you like. Mama, this looks so good. If you wear it, it will look even better. Okay listen, I have a bad headache, I have not had tea since morning.
I am going. Okay, listen, send Ramsha. 
It is really heavy; I will see it with her. 
Okay, fine. Fine. This is so heavy. Ramsha, come inside. See, a few options have come for wedding. Alizeh, what are you doing?
This is your scarf. Come here. I am seeing how 
it will look when I wear the dress. It looks good, right? Alizeh… But isn’t the colour a little too dark. I was saying… hey we had to have a power failure right now. Listen, you stay here, I am going 
to get the generator started. Stay here. This wedding cannot take place. But why? Did you people only find us 
to deceive and cheat? What are you saying? I am right. Hey, you people seemed like a 
good family and decent people. And these are your actions? You only found my son, for the daughter 
of yours who ran away. Ramsha, you know, child, I had a weird fear in my heart. I used to think that I don’t know if I will never be able to 
see you as a bride in my life, or not. Or will it ever happen that you get married in my life time. She is not worthy of me. I will just say this to you that forget the thought of this from your heart,
it would be better. I will not marry her under 
any circumstances. I will talk to Alizeh. I will make her understand, 
I will convince her. Even if she still doesn’t get convince, 
still… still I will not marry Ramsha. Alizeh. Alizeh. This is such a beautiful moment. I want this moment stays 
with us forever. You know, these deep breaths of yours are 
the reason for my life. I wish… I wish these moments never 
leave our life. Such beautiful moments are always 
part of our life. Man, what did you do? When did you come? I just came. Just now. Where did she go? Who, she?
Ramsha. Ramsha was not here when I came. Okay, leave her. You tell me, how do you like this scarf? The designer sent some options, 
so I am looking at that. Yes, it is really good. The colour seems really dark, 
put it on my head and show me. Here you go. It is really heavy, Afnan. What happened? All, okay? This is such a beautiful moment. I want this moment stays with us forever. You know, these deep breaths of yours are
 the reason for my life. I wish… I wish these moments never 
leave our life. Such beautiful moments are always 
part of our life. How dare you? How dare you wear Alizeh’s scarf? I didn’t wear it, Alizeh made me 
wear it herself. She made you wear it and 
you wore it easily. What happened at the time when 
I was talking to you considering you Alizeh. Why didn’t you speak up, then? The truth is you want to take 
Alizeh’s place in my life. If I had to get you with illegitimate ways, then it was not difficult for me. But I am not in the habit of taking 
someone else’s right. Hey, why will you take away her right? What has that poor thing done to you? And me? When did I promise you that 
I will marry you? Did I ever say that I love you? 
Why are you after me? The truth is you are envious of me 
and my happiness. You don’t want to see me happy 
with Alizeh, and you are having problem with 
why I am accepting Alizeh. Don’t put an allegation on me, Afnan. If this is not an allegation, 
then why are you doing all this? Why did you come here? 
Leave from here. The truth is you love me, and this love is your helplessness 
that is why you are not going from here. Yes, when a person loves, they also wish to get the other person, and I am not embarrassed 
to say this at all, that I love you even today. Like you don’t have it in your control 
to put love in your heart for me, just like that it is not in my control 
to take out your love from my heart. I love you even today. Look Afnan is getting married. After marriage, he will not 
give you importance, then what will you do? You will sit alone and get bored. That is why I am telling you 
befriend me. Hey, be my friend. 
Move out of my way. I am talking about coming close. I mean, our heart will come close 
if we become friends. You are moving me away. Look. Look, Ramsha, believe me. I will make you have an even better 
time than Afnan. There is so much liveliness at home, the mayun ceremony is happening 
and you are sitting alone over here. The ceremony is still happening? Yes, the ceremony is going on. 
There is so much liveliness. Come on. Come and see with me. No, right now, I don’t feel like coming. Madam Ramsha, are you feeling okay? You look tired. No, I am fine. You are not well. I can tell from your eyes, 
that you have cried a lot. Are you a doctor? No right? Then why are you asking me 
so many questions? And why have you come? Elder sir has sent me to call you. But you are not ready to go. Now what do I say to him when I go? Tell him, that I… I will come in a while myself. Okay fine. What are you looking at? I am seeing the color of my love is shining 
brighter than my expectation on your face. The henna on my hand is 
witness of that color. See. The color of our love has 
come out so well. You know, Afnan, I had never thought we would 
get married so soon. How could we not get married soon? I have loved you a lot. Even I have loved you a lot. Okay, prove it then. What do you mean? Okay see, I have also got your hand written. Oh yes, but my name was written in 
your hands from the start. This also looks good. Okay tell me, where will we go for our honeymoon 
after marriage?
