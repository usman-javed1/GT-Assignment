[21.36] Ramsha, I have packed all 
your things in this.
[25.04] If you want me to keep anything else 
then tell me.
[27.56] I am asking you Ramsha.
[29.64] Ramsha. 
Yes?
[31.16] I am asking you Ramsha. 
What happened, Annie?
[34.16] I think you have no interest 
in your wedding, Ramsha.
[41.24] Ramsha,
[43.08] forget Afnan.
[50.16] Take him out of your heart.
[53.44] I have distanced myself as much as 
I could Annie.
[62.44] But there are some things
 that are not in our control.
[67.16] Your heart,
[69.20] your thinking is not in your control.
[75.68] If it was,
[77.72] then we would always remember things 
that would bring us happiness.
[82.96] We would never have tears in our eyes.
[88.04] But this doesn’t happen.
[91.24] This doesn’t happen.
[94.84] You are absolutely right.
[97.88] A person only has their actions 
in their control,
[101.08] but not their thinking.
[105.36] Annie, you just pray
[109.04] that after marriage, I am able
to keep Nabeel happy.
[113.20] I am able to live a peaceful right,
[116.68] so that he stays happy and so do I.
[120.32] My prayers are always with you.
[143.44] Did you bring me here?
[144.96] No, no, I came to visit you.
[147.80] Of course, I brought you.
[152.52] And if I had not come there,
[154.24] then do you know what would have 
happened with you?
[157.08] You were unconscious
[158.84] and your friend had left you alone 
and went.
[165.52] What?
[166.56] Why are you laughing now?
[169.48] I am thinking.
[171.96] Whenever I have called you in trouble, 
you come.
[176.92] The problem is you get caught 
in a lot of troubles.
[191.76] I don’t know what they would have 
done to me.
[193.80] They were going to do something 
bad with me.
[196.24] Ramsha,
[198.36] how could I not come?
[202.92] It was you,
[205.12] I had to come for you at all cost.
[210.56] And I know well, 
you have not done anything,
[213.84] you are being framed in this matter.
[218.92] But I am with you, Ramsha.
[222.08] I will not leave you alone 
in this difficult time.
[225.20] And we will get through this.
[227.24] Come on, sit in the car, 
eat something too.
[232.12] Ramsha.
[234.80] Hey, child,
[236.04] you two have packed all the things, right?
[240.40] Yes, elder mama, 
I have packed all the things.
[242.64] You tell elder papa to take out the car, 
I will go get ready and come.
[245.64] Fine, child.
[247.44] Okay, you too child, 
check on all the things, okay?
[251.48] Mama,
[257.96] you keep this.
[263.96] Now I don’t need this.
[267.24] Whenever I want to talk to you 
I will do it from Nabeel’s number.
[345.80] What happened?
[346.88] Give me whatever you have quickly.
[348.48] Give it quickly. Give it quickly.
[350.08] What do you want?
Give whatever is kept. Give it quickly.
[353.20] Man this…
[354.88] Give it quickly. I don’t have time.
[356.52] Be quick. Be quick. 
Listen to me.
[359.08] Come on. Come on. 
Come on.
[380.80] It was five hundred thousand rupees.
[384.04] Brother, I left the bank and two boys 
suddenly came from somewhere
[388.76] and snatched it.
[392.96] I have told you so many times,
[394.36] we have to be very careful in bringing
and taking money.
[397.24] Brother, I was really careful.
[399.96] You believe me, 
I didn’t even take a bag,
[403.64] so that no one has a doubt that 
I have such a big sum of money.
[410.24] I feel someone has spied on me.
[412.52] How would anyone know 
I have so much cash?
[415.12] These thieves and robbers know 
everything my brother.
[421.64] Now what do we do?
[422.76] I have to make the payment 
for the hall and food.
[425.20] Hey, what do you mean 
what will you have to do?
[427.12] Take a loan from someone.
[430.48] That’s why I used to tell you 
to have some arrangement.
[433.60] We will have to do something now.
[436.24] I made a mistake, 
I should have done this.
[440.56] Brother, if you agree to me,
[443.80] then try talking to Mr. Qasim.
[450.12] How can I talk to Mr. Qasim?
[453.00] Is he our relative that he will stand for us.
[460.36] No, it doesn’t sound reasonable.
[463.28] Brother, Mr. Qasim is a good hearted man,
[467.96] and he is also wealthy.
[471.96] Did you not see how he helps people?
[476.24] Some times, if your own don’t come to help,
[479.04] then strangers help you.
[480.88] You try to talk to Mr. Qasim 
on my insistence once.
[491.64] He is right.
[522.72] My God, Alizay.
[525.60] Alizay.
[527.20] Alizay, wake up. You are alive right?
[529.40] Alizay, get up, Sunday doesn’t mean 
that a person sleeps all day long.
[533.60] Afnan, you are the enemy of my sleep.
[535.84] Do a job then you will know.
[538.04] Alizay,
[539.24] Sunday doesn’t mean 
that you sleep till night.
[542.44] Look at the time, it is almost night. 
Get up come on.
[545.56] Let me sleep for ten more minutes please,
 Afnan.
[547.28] There is no need. Leave it. Leave it.
That’s it, get up. It is enough.
[550.44] You are really bad. Give it to me.
[551.80] I am very bad, thank you so much.
[554.08] Get up, man, 
what is wrong?
[556.20] Okay, tell me, what is for lunch?
[557.76] Hey it is not lunch time it is dinner time
[560.88] and why do you care what is cooked?
[563.04] We are going out for dinner. 
So just get ready.
[566.28] Okay, go make me a good cup of coffee.
[570.12] First ask me with love, then I will make it.
[577.28] Afnan, please make coffee for me.
[580.00] What?
[581.24] I didn’t hear it. Please, say it again.
[585.76] Afnan, please make coffee for me.
[589.00] If you say it with so much love,
[591.32] then why coffee, I will give my life.
[594.28] What do I ask you for something 
that is already mine?
[599.32] Are you sure?
[601.28] Go make me coffee. 
Okay fine.
[604.24] But.
[605.12] But don’t sleep. 
Should I give you the pillow?
[606.80] Yes. 
No.
[608.76] Here. Here. I will bring it.
[611.00] Don’t sleep. 
Yes, fine, okay.
[629.20] Brother, what is the update? 
What did Mr. Qasim say?
[632.88] Thank God, the issue is solved, Anwar.
[635.40] Brother Qasim was not in the city,
[637.56] he said he is sending his son
 with the money.
[640.76] He is a really good man.
[642.32] Brother…
[643.32] He helped us in this difficulty
 being a stranger.
[646.00] May God keep him happy.
[647.28] My heart said he would be of 
use for us.
[649.60] Okay, let me try calling Mr. Iqbal. 
It is really late.
[653.00] Did they leave home or not?
[654.84] Although I told him to come on time.
[657.00] I will just call. 
Hey, listen…
[667.04] Hello.
[669.04] Hey, you told me even before I asked you.
[671.12] Yes, yes, we are waiting for you, come.
[673.40] Come on. Goodbye.
[678.00] Yes, yes, dad. Yes, I am leaving in a bit.
[681.84] Yes, yes, you don’t worry.
[683.72] I will do everything with responsibility.
[686.44] I will go there and make him talk to you.
[688.96] Yes, dad, I will reach in an hour.
[692.64] Yes. Take care.
[694.84] Goodbye.
[697.00] Shall we go, Afnan?
[697.96] By the way, where are we going for dinner?
[701.84] Alizay is it possible that we postpone 
our dinner for tomorrow?
[705.28] There is an emergency.
[707.60] What is this, Afnan?
[709.84] You woke me from my sleep
[711.40] and I got ready so quickly for you,
[713.92] and now you are saying 
we don’t have to go for dinner.
[715.36] Hey…
This is not right.
[717.32] Look if you don’t go for dinner 
with me today,
[719.28] then I will not go for dinner with you again.
[721.00] And what is so important that 
you are postponing our dinner for it.
[725.00] Hey, if you be quiet, then I will tell you.
[727.68] Dad’s friend’s daughter is 
getting married today.
[730.44] Today is the wedding, they need money.
[732.56] So, dad has put the responsibility on me 
to drop the money.
[735.44] Yes, so we will go for dinner, 
from there we will see.
[738.52] What will we, Alizay?
[740.28] What Afnan?
[741.68] Okay fine,
[743.92] first I will feed you. 
Come on.
[746.92] If you bother me…
[823.40] Man, I didn’t understand one thing.
[824.88] You used to say I will get married late,
[826.88] in fact, I will not get married 
in the next two years.
[829.48] Then what is this suddenly?
[831.80] Man, mama was hasty, so I said…
[836.36] Leave it. Leave it.
[838.24] Your happiness is telling me how much 
you wanted to get married.
[843.96] Hey, why do you bother my son? 
What is wrong?
[847.44] Aunt, he is my only cousin
[850.20] and then he is also my best friend,
[852.00] if I don’t bother him, who will I bother?
[856.08] That is true. But honestly son,
[858.68] Nabeel really wasn’t ready to get married,
[861.36] he was asking me a lot of time 
to set up his business.
[865.20] Did you hear that?
[866.12] But the girl’s family had put so much
pressure for the marriage,
[868.48] that we have to get the marriage done soon.
[870.32] Thank God he too agreed,
[872.92] or else I wouldn’t have got my hands
on this for two to four years.
[888.60] Call Mehnaz,
[891.40] so that we can start the wedding 
and also bring the bride.
[893.92] Yes, I was coming to ask you
[896.44] when you want to get the wedding done?
We will bring the bride.
[1076.56] Yes, yes, I think it is time.
Call the molvi for the wedding.
[1081.08] Yes, yes.
[1094.80] Ask Fahad. 
Speak up Fahad.
[1096.64] Fahad will tell you. 
Fahad will tell you.
[1098.96] Fahad is my best friend. 
And you know what Fahad’s quality is?
[1102.60] He never lies.
[1103.84] He always speaks the truth, right Fahad?
[1105.76] Fahad, this is Ramsha,
[1108.04] and it is Ramsha’s birthday today.
[1110.76] Happy birthday Ramsha.
[1224.96] Look,
[1226.44] I have told you honestly 
whatever I knew about this girl.
[1233.04] Such a girl has a relation with a lot of men.
[1237.32] If you take my advice,
[1238.96] then you still have time.
[1241.92] Save yourself.
[1244.00] Fahad, what are you saying?
[1246.48] Aunt Parveen has fixed the proposal,
[1248.72] and she knows their whole family.
[1252.24] I am sure you have a misunderstanding.
[1255.28] Hey, I have no misunderstanding.
[1258.44] All of these people are fooling you.
[1261.88] And you must have heard the idiom,
[1264.68] no matter how the lover is,
[1267.44] but the bride should be of a good character,
[1269.88] and this girl is worth making a lover,
[1273.68] and not a wife.
[1274.84] Fahad, I don’t believe it.
[1277.80] Look, mama has done proper investigation
[1280.80] and everything is done.
[1283.76] I am getting married and you are saying 
the girl is not right.
[1289.44] You don’t believe me, right?
[1298.00] Look at this.
[1348.24] Sister Fareeda
[1349.44] Please call the groom, 
we are getting late.
[1352.68] Yes, sure!
[1354.76] I don’t know what Fahad has taken 
Nabeel to talk about.
[1359.12] I will go call them myself, 
and they can talk later.
[1363.28] I will call them.
[1385.64] Nabeel, son, come on,
[1387.88] everyone is waiting for you there.
[1391.96] What has happened?
[1431.76] What would have happened, Annie?
[1434.68] Nothing,
[1437.16] maybe he wanted to talk about 
something to his mother.
[1439.76] Don’t worry, he must be coming.
[1447.04] Sister in law. 
Yes?
[1449.08] First the groom went his cousin
[1452.40] and now his mother went too. 
Did something happen?
[1456.56] No Salma,
[1458.20] it is possible they went to talk 
amongst themselves.
[1462.20] Wait a little, they will come.
[1464.24] No sister in law, you go and find out,
[1467.00] we are getting late for the wedding.
[1468.76] Salma, it doesn’t seem right,
[1470.96] they must have gone to talk 
about something personal.
[1473.76] Maybe they are discussing something.
[1476.32] Wait a while, we will see, then.
[1491.12] Brother Iqbal is all okay?
[1493.92] Yes, yes, all is okay.
[1496.80] I don’t know what Farida is talking 
to Nabeel and Fahad about.
[1501.64] Don’t worry, I will bring them.
[1503.44] Yes, yes, actually, they are waiting 
for the wedding.
[1505.92] Yes.
[1529.56] What is the matter, son? 
Is everything okay?
[1564.08] Mr. Sajid,
[1565.32] call the groom for the wedding soon,
[1567.60] delaying it for long is not good.
[1569.48] I have to lead a wedding 
somewhere else too.
[1571.96] Yes, they will just come.
[1619.04] Molvi sahib, you start the wedding,
[1621.80] the groom is here. 
This wedding cannot happen.
[1640.12] Hey,
[1644.08] but why?
[1647.64] Did you find us people to lie to 
and deceive?
[1663.56] What are you saying?
[1665.16] I am right.
[1667.12] Hey, you people looked like a good family
and simple people,
[1671.12] and this is what you are up to?
[1677.12] You had found my son for your daughter 
who had run away?
[1694.52] You people must have thought
they are decent and simple people,
[1698.00] let’s trap them. Right?
[1702.36] Thank God Fahad told us about 
all your daughter’s actions.
[1705.64] If Fahad was not there,
[1707.88] then we would have been 
caught in your trap.
[1724.56] Ask Fahad. Speak up Fahad.
[1726.68] Fahad will tell you. 
Fahad will tell you.
[1728.96] Fahad is my best friend.
[1730.64] And you know what Fahad’s quality is?
[1732.32] He never lies. 
He always speaks the truth,
[1735.08] right Fahad? Fahad, this is Ramsha.
[1747.64] You have some misunderstanding.
[1749.64] Whatever it is, we will sit in the corner 
and talk, please.
[1753.32] Look, the guests and 
everyone is listening.
[1756.48] Hey, my child had made a mistake
in her naivety,
[1761.04] there is nothing like you think.
[1764.16] You please, come to the side with me,
we will sit and talk.
[1768.80] That’s it,
[1769.96] we cannot talk to you people 
about anything.
[1772.96] The person who lies once, 
they lie again and again.
[1777.64] You people are not worth trusting.
[1779.60] No brother…
[1782.08] Brother Iqbal, listen to us,
[1784.44] give us a chance to clarify.
[1786.48] You just listen to brother once.
[1796.16] Sister in law, believe me,
[1798.36] Anwar is right. If there is something,
[1801.76] us family should sit and talk about it,
[1804.04] we shouldn’t make noise in front 
of the guests like this.
[1807.72] Really?
[1808.80] Is there something left to talk about now?
[1811.80] Son, Nabeel,
[1814.36] son, make your mother understand. 
Make her understand.
[1817.80] Leave it aunt,
[1819.32] we don’t need to understand, 
you need to understand.
[1821.84] We are decent people
[1824.08] and your daughter also has an affair 
with Fahad’s friend.
[1848.48] Fahad, tell them.
[1851.20] He is absolutely right.
[1853.52] If you don’t believe me,
[1856.52] then I will show you too.
[1860.04] You too see it.
[1868.88] Papa…
[1890.72] Alizay,
[1893.12] shall we hurry up? I think 
we are getting a little late.
[1896.44] What is problem, Afnan? 
Let me eat properly.
[1899.60] Where do you have to go?
[1901.00] Hey, I don’t have to go anywhere.
[1902.64] Dad has strictly instructed, 
we should reach there on time.
[1905.60] If dad finds out then 
he will get really angry.
[1909.28] We will get food packed. 
You can go home and eat.
[1912.28] Oh thank you so much,
you brought me here.
[1915.40] How will I thank you?
[1917.48] You did such a big favour on me.
[1919.52] No, no, don’t get upset.
[1921.28] Okay fine, you eat properly, it is okay.
[1924.44] No leave it, let’s go.
[1925.60] What is wrong?
[1926.76] Why do you get angry all of a sudden?
[1929.24] I am telling you, easy, 
make yourself comfortable.
[1932.04] I will talk to dad, okay?
[1935.08] You too eat.
[1975.44] Look brother, why are you looking away?
[1981.80] See what sort of clothes 
your daughter is wearing.
[1984.84] Do girls of decent homes wear 
such clothes?
[1989.32] No aunty,
[1990.96] my papa and mama has no fault in this,
[1995.72] they have no mistake, 
it is all cause of me.
[1998.76] I am responsible for all this.
[2006.68] The wrong use of social media has 
not just made my head bow down,
[2010.80] but it has bowed down 
my entire family today.
[2022.60] I did lose my way in the search 
of cheap fame and money,
[2028.48] but I didn’t go off track.
[2039.48] God brought me back on the 
right track, aunty.
[2043.24] I had made a mistake,
[2045.40] don’t punish me like this.
[2048.12] Mistake?
[2049.48] You are calling your sin a mistake?
[2053.12] Who did you run away with?
[2058.72] I would say, whoever she ran with,
[2061.48] marry her to him and save your respect,
[2064.56] that would be really better for you.
[2068.28] Hey, now I understand
[2070.64] why they were in a hurry 
to get the wedding done.
[2075.72] Hey, they must have thought 
there is still time.
[2078.32] Put someone else’s sin on others.
[2082.92] Hey, obviously, she was away from home
for so many days,
[2085.48] so she must have done a lot.
[2095.64] No, no, sister Farida, fear God.
[2098.84] Our daughter only and only left home
 in search of fame.
[2103.36] But she didn’t run away with a boy,
 there is nothing like that.
[2107.20] I am not shameless like you people.
[2111.80] If my daughter had gone somewhere,
[2113.48] I would not have let her come back home.
[2125.56] I explained the same thing to you,
[2128.56] now the world is calling you shameless.
[2130.68] Had I known your daughter’s actions,
[2133.52] I would never have brought 
a proposal here.
[2137.96] You have made a joke out of us
 in front of the world.
[2162.12] Thank you so much, Afnan.
[2164.92] It was a lot of fun today.
[2167.40] A person should have outings.
[2170.16] I am tired cause of office work.
[2173.36] Hey, I ask you that let’s go for a drive,
[2177.40] we will go out, but you don’t have time.
[2182.60] You know how tough my job is.
[2185.68] I have a lot of responsibility.
[2189.24] That is why I don’t get time.
[2192.40] Okay, Alizay, listen.
[2196.20] Dad has put such a big responsibility 
on my head for no reason.
[2200.24] There is a friend of his, Mr. Sajid,
[2203.12] I have to drop an entrustment 
to him on the way,
[2205.80] so can we stop there for two minutes?
[2208.24] Afnan, please, no, drop me home,
[2210.44] then you can go where you want, please.
[2212.16] Alizay, come on, please try 
and understand.
[2214.84] It is already really late, 
I should have been there earlier.
