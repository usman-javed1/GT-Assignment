[45.20] Greetings.
[46.96] How are you?
[47.88] Good, thank you so much.
[51.80] Tell me if you have anything lacking,
difference in quality
[55.08] or if you have any complaint,
then do tell me.
[57.16] Hey, no, no,
what are you saying, Sajid?
[59.88] The quality of everything is good.
[62.40] In fact, I am surprised that
[63.64] you added a couple of more
things in the grocery.
[67.04] It is good,
[67.92] it will be more convenient for them.
[69.88] May God bless you and increase
your business further.
[72.92] Thank you very much. Thank you.
[75.40] I have a friend, Mr. Hamid Baig.
[78.52] You must have heard the name
of Hamid Chemical.
[80.48] He has a big company.
[82.48] He is from amongst those that
spend in what God gave him.
[85.28] He arrange groceries.
[87.52] So I gave him your number,
[88.72] it is possible he might contact you.
[90.80] Thank you very much, Mr. Sajid.
[93.04] Because of you, my business
has increased a lot.
[96.20] May God always keep us thankful to him.
[98.24] He makes it happen.
[99.88] He creates the means and everything.
[103.16] I also wanted to apologize to you that
[106.00] you had to come yourself
to get the cheque.
[108.40] Actually, I had made it my son Afnan
responsible for your payment,
[111.84] he has gone to Islamabad for some work.
[114.44] It is God’s good, and he is the only son,
[117.88] so he has a lot of
responsibilities on him.
[120.60] May God give him life.
[122.88] No issues, it is work, it happens.
[128.12] There is a boy on your shop,
[131.28] what is his name? Shani.
[132.40] Is he your son?
[134.08] No, he is not my son.
[135.68] He is my brother Anwar’s son,
he is my nephew.
[138.88] Okay. Okay.
[139.84] So how many children
do you have?
[145.80] Ramsha.
[147.56] Here you go, your light.
[148.84] You brought it.
[149.76] You are so good, thank you.
[151.72] Hey, if my daughter makes a wish
[153.40] and I don’t fulfill it.
How is that possible?
[155.04] Thank you, papa.
[155.92] What was the need to bring this?
[158.00] You fulfill every insistence of hers.
[160.04] This love and affection of
yours has spoiled her.
[163.84] ‘We have one daughter, wife of mine.
[166.16] If I don’t take care of her wishes,
[167.48] then will we care for the
wishes of the neighbours.
[172.88] Our daughter has achieved a great feat,
[176.76] so the whole city should know about it.
[179.48] Sajid, don’t say that.
[181.32] Ramsha is our daughter.
[182.84] She was.
[186.76] She isn’t anymore.
[188.64] She has no relation
with us or this home.
[202.12] I have no child.
[205.28] I am childless.
[211.24] It is God’s will.
[216.12] The nephew and nieces
are like your children.
[221.16] Did you not have tea?
[221.96] No, I have given time to someone.
[224.56] Hey, not like that.
[225.24] I will go now.
[227.36] Goodbye.
[227.84] Goodbye. Thank you.
[269.92] Ramsha.
[272.56] Ramsha.
[274.20] Hey, I brought soup for you.
[277.52] Move this from here.
[280.20] Mama, I had told you
I don’t want to have soup.
[282.88] I don’t want to drink soup.
[284.36] Why don’t you want to have it, child?
[285.80] You are not well.
You have not eaten anything,
[288.44] . This way you will get unwell further.
[290.56] Drink some soup, then
I will bring medication for you.
[293.16] Come on.
[294.48] Mama, I don’t want to have medication,
[295.68] nor do I want to drink anything,
[297.00] nor eat anything,
[298.52] you leave, let me sleep
for some time please.
[300.96] Hey, how is that possible?
[302.80] Did you see?
[304.04] She is not eating anything,
nor drinking anything.
[305.52] Hey, if she eats something,
then I will give her medication.
[307.64] Make her understand.
[308.96] Child, your mother is right,
[311.60] if you don’t eat anything, then
how will you get better?
[314.00] Come on, have soup.
[315.52] I had told mama that
I don’t want to have soup,
[318.24] still she brought it.
[321.52] If you don’t want to have soup,
then what will my daughter eat?
[326.52] Zinger burger.
[328.04] Don’t you dare.
[329.12] Don’t you dare, get her
a zinger burger.
[332.72] She is in this condition
having food from outside.
[336.32] She will just have soup.
[337.80] Yes, you are absolutely right, Kulsoom.
[339.80] Child, you have the soup
and while you drink it,
[341.80] I will quietly bring you a burger. Okay?
[345.28] What? What?
[345.92] What are the father and
daughter talking about?
[347.16] No, nothing. You leave it.
[349.76] I will give soup to my daughter
with my own hands.
[351.76] You leave. Leave.
[356.04] I am bringing her medication.
[357.08] Have it slowly. Come on.
[359.24] Have it, yourself. Come on.
[361.48] It is so delicious.
[363.28] That’s it…
[363.76] Drink it. Drink it.
[365.84] Where is your mobile?
[368.12] I don’t know, it is kept here somewhere.
[369.64] I want to have a zinger burger, not this.
[371.00] I am ordering it for my daughter.
[373.24] Okay, drink it. I will just order it.
[389.60] Papa and mama might not talk to me,
[394.48] I will try calling Annie.
[396.68] j
[428.32] Hello.
[431.36] Hello.
[433.88] Hello, who is it? Speak up.
[449.24] Who was calling you?
[453.72] What would I know?
[455.04] You answered the phone,
you would know.
[457.28] Yes, so I received the call and
said hello, no one answered.
[463.16] Tell me honestly, who was it?
[466.36] I am surprised mama,
[467.68] my phone is with you all day long
and still you are doubting me.
[470.88] Ramsha ran away from the home
[472.36] and my life has become hell.
[473.72] Are you people doing right with me?
[476.12] Mama, there is a limit to everything,
[477.24] for God’s sake, stop doubting me.
[483.44] She talks nonsense for no reason.
[585.24] Sister in law if you want something,
then tell me.
[587.20] I am working in the kitchen.
[589.64] No Salma,
[591.52] you work in the kitchen all day long.
[594.12] I came to make tea.
[597.52] My Ramsha is not there anymore.
[608.48] Sister in law,
[610.92] get a grip on yourself.
[613.28] How long will you stay worried like this?
[617.52] How do I get a grip?
[621.08] She was part of my existence.
[624.24] I cannot cut her and throw her away.
[629.68] I can understand your sorrow.
[632.68] I too am the mother a daughter.
[636.52] You have no idea.
[640.08] You cannot have an idea,
you can never understand.
[643.84] Your daughter knew everything,
[646.80] but she didn’t tell us anything.
[649.48] I don’t know where that damned
girl would be right now.
[653.12] What condition would she be in?
[655.72] Sister in law, I asked Annie a lot.
[659.36] If she knew anything,
she would have surely told me.
[662.96] You know,
[664.72] someone called twice
on your home number,
[667.92] but no one spoke.
[670.60] What if,
[673.88] it was my Ramsha who called?
[677.28] Oh God,
[678.48] you keep my daughter in
your protection, my lord.
[681.84] Amen.
[684.88] You go ahead,
[686.28] I will make tea and give it to you. Go.
[721.24] Oh God, my head.
[725.64] Oh.
[729.72] Hania. Hania.
[733.52] Hania. Oh.
[737.28] Oh.
[740.84] Hania.
[745.76] Hania. Hania, is not at home.
[751.92] Oh, my head. My phone.
[774.56] Yes, Ramsha, go ahead.
[776.68] Afnan,
[778.68] I have a really bad headache.
[781.48] I have high fever.
[783.08] I feel my head will explode.
[785.44] Hey, why are you crying?
What happened to you?
[787.68] Are you okay?
[789.44] I don’t know Afnan.
[791.36] I don’t understand anything.
[793.04] My head is hurting really badly.
[795.44] I don’t have the strength to get up
and go to the hospital.
[799.56] Okay relax. Don’t worry.
[802.44] Where is your friend?
Make her talk to me.
[804.96] She is not at home.
[806.96] I am dying. My head is hurting badly,
[811.12] no one is at home.
[814.32] Hello. Ramsha.
[816.36] Ramsha. Ramsha,
what happened?
[848.80] Hello.
[850.96] Afnan.
[852.88] How are you feeling now?
[856.84] You brought me here?
[858.40] No, no, I came to visit you.
[861.32] Of course I brought you here.
[866.04] And had I not come there,
[867.68] you know what would have
happened with you?
[870.72] You were lying unconscious,
[872.36] and your friend had left
you alone and gone.
[879.00] What? Why are you laughing now?
[882.92] I am thinking.
[885.28] Whenever I call you in trouble,
you always come.
[890.16] The problem is you get
stuck in difficulties a lot.
[897.68] Will you agree to something?
[899.60] Yes?
[901.12] Go back to your home.
[905.96] Your family must be worried.
[912.96] And see yourself, you were alone here,
[914.84] what could have happened to you?
[918.32] Think yourself.
[919.96] You were so unwell.
[922.52] You were completely alone.
[923.80] Even your friend was
not there with you.
[925.08] God forbid, if something
had happened, then?
[927.96] What would the family have done?
[930.48] They too would have brought
me to the hospital.
[933.52] So you brought me.
[934.84] Man…
[937.32] you know what your biggest problem is?
[940.36] You don’t understand.
[942.32] Okay, don’t scold me.
[944.52] I am really unwell
[946.24] and then you are scolding me.
[948.84] Hey, I am not scolding you.
[951.52] Hey, listen, you call and ask
a friend to come to you.
[955.56] I have a really important meeting.
[957.00] I was going there, I got a call from you,
[958.96] so I came to you.
[960.24] But now I have to leave.
[961.88] Okay, don’t worry. Leave.
[964.56] As soon as the drip ends,
I too will leave.
[967.72] You have supported me so much,
this is enough for me.
[970.24] You please, go.
[971.48] I will tell the hospital staff to come check
on you again and again. Okay?
[976.28] And will you be able to manage alone?
[980.08] Yes, you go without worrying.
[983.04] You wont get into any
other problem, right?
[986.52] If I get caught, you are here.
[990.44] You wont learn. Okay,
[993.28] I will go now. Bye.
[996.00] Bye.
[1064.00] Oh hi.
[1066.40] How are you feeling now?
[1068.04] You came with Danish Kamal?
[1070.48] Yes, why?
[1072.28] But why, Hania?
[1074.72] I have signed a project with him.
[1076.96] But why, Hania?
[1078.28] Don’t you know his nature?
[1082.12] Ramsha, he has offered me
a handsome amount.
[1086.00] He wont give you anything.
[1087.52] He only talks, dramas, he only lies.
[1092.72] Ramsha, listen to me. Look,
[1096.12] he has already transferred
one million in my account,
[1100.52] which is my advance payment.
[1103.12] You will do anything for money, Hania?
[1105.12] What do you mean I will do anything?
[1107.64] I am not marrying him.
[1109.80] Buddy, I just signed a project with him,
[1112.68] I am not making him my boyfriend,
[1115.72] and see, nowadays,
[1118.24] I needed a handsome amount nowadays,
[1119.92] that is why I signed this project.
[1125.28] Okay. Okay,.
[1127.40] I will tell you everything.
[1130.12] Vicky and I are planning to
settle in Europe.
[1136.44] Now who is this Vicky?
[1139.04] I have to tell you everything clearly,
[1141.92] that who is Vicky.
[1143.60] Vicky is my boyfriend,
[1146.36] so we have planned that we will settle in Europe after marriage.
[1151.16] Look, he doesn’t need money, and he doesn’t have any such issue,
[1156.44] but his parents are not agreeing for our marriage,
[1159.08] so we had to do this planning.
[1163.76] Okay leave all this,
[1165.12] listen to me.
[1165.96] I am sending you a number and along with it,
I am sending you a location.
[1169.28] You go there, there are two
scenes, get them shot.
[1172.08] Then you will see,
[1173.12] you will get good work in future too.
[1175.88] Yes, but right now, I am not that well…
[1178.36] Look,
[1179.88] if you don’t get well now,
[1181.80] then the future will be spoiled too.
[1183.96] Go right now,
[1184.76] do this work, then you can see.
[1187.44] You will become a shining star
[1189.84] and I believe in you. Okay?
[1194.20] Oh, you come inside with me.
[1198.68] I will explain everything to you.
I will remove all your confusion.
[1235.76] Mama, I spoke to Afnan.
[1238.60] He was saying he shopped for me.
[1240.64] I got worried hearing it.
[1242.68] Hey, what is there to be worried in this?
[1245.28] This is something to be happy about.
[1247.28] You know, Afnan cannot shop.
[1250.36] He will bring whatever he gets his hands on.
[1252.88] That is so bad.
[1254.80] He is bringing so many things
for you with so much love,
[1258.96] now you don’t make a face,
[1260.16] or he will be really sad.
[1262.76] I am saying something to you.
[1264.56] I don’t know, mama.
[1267.56] Just do what I have told you.
[1270.68] By the way,
[1271.48] you are really worried about your nephew.
[1274.48] Why shouldn’t I be worried?
[1275.96] Hey, he is my only and beloved nephew.
[1278.72] After all, he is my future son in law too.
[1289.92] That’s how it is going on.
[1292.00] Yes.
[1293.80] No. No. No. Vicky, I will talk to you in a bit.
[1299.32] Yes, yes, okay. Okay.
[1304.04] I have been calling you for so long, Hania,
[1306.04] your number is busy for the
past two hours.
[1308.96] What happened?
[1311.20] I was busy with Vicky on the phone,
[1313.32] and why were you calling me?
[1316.28] You know, Hania,
[1317.96] I have been standing on
bus stop for two hours,
[1320.12] there was no bus or taxi.
[1322.00] And the two cars on the
shoot were also busy,
[1323.84] they just sent me away like that.
[1325.92] You didn’t call me in
so long that if I am fine,
[1328.88] alive, am I fine or not?
[1330.72] Come on, Ramsha,
[1332.28] I am not your mother that
I worry for you.
[1334.56] I have a lot of things keeping
me busy as well.
[1340.08] You are right.
[1342.40] You are not my mother that
you will worry for me.
[1346.76] Mothers worry.
[1349.72] If I used to get a little late
from university,
[1353.44] then my mother would
wait for me on the door.
[1358.60] Okay, listen to me.
[1360.36] You shouldn’t have left the
shoot so soon.
[1363.76] You should have ordered an online taxi.
[1365.92] The online taxi made me go aimlessly.
[1368.32] I couldn’t find a taxi,
[1373.52] and then on top of that I had a
fight with the manager as well.
[1375.80] Ramsha, how many times have I told you,
[1377.84] you are new in the field.
[1379.80] You will have to adjust to everything,
[1381.84] you will have to tolerate it all.
[1383.40] Hey Hania, how much more do I adjust?
[1385.92] They give no sort of facility,
[1387.48] they give such little money,
[1389.00] listen to everything,
do all kinds of character,
[1390.92] how else do I adjust.
[1395.92] I have to tolerate so much
even not wanting to.
[1400.52] You are right.
[1403.08] But you will see,
[1404.60] that time will come soon,
[1406.64] when you wont tolerate people,
people will tolerate you.
[1409.48] Okay?
[1411.40] I don’t know.
[1412.76] I don’t know when that time will come.
[1413.88] Hey listen to me. Ramsha. Ramsha.
[1429.08] Annie..
[1431.72] You still haven’t gone to
sleep elder mama?
[1434.80] Child, I am unable to sleep.
[1438.00] I feel really restless.
[1445.24] You are awake till now.
[1446.92] What are you doing?
[1449.76] I have to submit the
assignment tomorrow,
[1451.80] so I am completing that.
[1458.16] Annie,
[1460.64] do people ask about
Ramsha in the university?
[1466.76] Elder mama, in the start everyone asked.
[1469.32] I told everyone Ramsha
has gone to Nawabshah,
[1473.28] now no one asks.
[1479.60] And after all,
[1480.80] with time, people don’t
remember anything,
[1483.76] they all get busy in their lives.
[1489.92] You are right.
[1493.08] With time, people forget everything.
[1499.08] It is a mother who is unable
to forget her child, ever.
[1509.84] Annie, child,
[1512.08] Do you know anything about that boy
you mentioned was in the university?
[1521.16] I mean,
[1522.68] if you have his phone number,
[1525.04] then please give it to me.
[1527.28] I will not mention anything to anyone, child.
[1533.84] I don’t know who he is,
[1536.52] where he lives,
[1538.80] I don’t know anything.
[1544.72] Have you ever seen that boy?
[1584.96] I don’t know what is the problem.
Hania should have taken the keys,
[1587.80] she is ringing the bell for no reason.
[1590.52] I am coming.
[1602.12] Hania, why didn’t you take your keys…
[1604.84] You?
[1606.44] Yes, me.
[1609.64] Hania is not at home, you leave…
[1611.72] I know Hania is not there. You come on.
[1614.92] Come.
[1616.40] I am telling you Hania is not at home,
[1618.52] don’t you understand?
[1619.72] Hey, I know, I know Hania is not at home.
[1624.24] I spoke to her.
[1626.40] Answer me one thing,
[1628.28] you consider anyone’s home
your own and give orders?
[1633.64] I really like this innocence of yours.
[1637.24] Look, listen to me, leave from here.
[1639.92] Why are you bothering me?
[1640.72] Hey, listen to me.
[1643.96] Tell me something.
[1645.92] Why did you leave my
big palace like home
[1649.88] and come to this flat?
[1652.92] What is the matter, baby?
[1654.68] I think you have gotten
used to running away.
[1658.40] Look, this habit is not good.
[1661.48] You leave from here,
when Hania comes…
[1663.40] Listen to me.
[1664.24] Leave me.
[1665.32] Listen to me for a minute.
[1670.76] No. Where did he come from?
[1673.16] Open the door.
[1674.48] Please open the door.
[1676.00] What is the issue with you?
[1677.32] Why are you not going from here?
[1678.68] Hey, listen to me.
[1681.76] I don’t want to meet you.
[1683.56] Open the door for a minute,
[1685.08] I have to talk to you about
something really important.
[1688.80] What do I do? Hania…
[1704.36] Hello. Yes, Ramsha, go ahead.
[1706.68] Hello, Hania, where are you?
[1708.32] What time will you come?
[1709.56] How long will you take to come home?
[1710.68] Where are you right now?
 You know
[1711.76] that Danish is outside our home. 
He is here.
[1714.12] I am alone, Hania.
[1716.20] I am going to reach in a while.
[1718.68] I asked him to wait for me.
[1721.28] Hania, you should have called
 him in your presence.
[1723.88] You know what sort of a man he is. 
I am alone at home.
[1726.52] How long will you take to come home?
[1728.08] Ramsha, you are worried for no reason.
[1730.12] He is my guest, he will not 
say anything to you.
[1733.48] Okay listen,
[1734.40] if you are so scared,
[1735.72] then lock the room from 
inside and sit. Okay?
[1738.20] I have locked the door, Hania.
[1740.36] Yes, so what is there to
 be scared in this?
[1741.96] He is not a ghost that he will 
come inside from a closed door.
[1749.68] You don’t worry,
 I am reaching in a while. Okay?
[1752.48] I am coming.
[1754.04] Okay. Okay, bye.
[1762.60] What is the problem? 
Why are you not leaving?
[1764.08] Why don’t you leave me alone?
[1766.20] Please open the door,
[1767.48] I have to talk to you about
 something important.
[1769.24] Don’t bother me.
[1770.72] Leave from here.
[1772.52] Hania is coming,
 don’t bother me. Please.
[1776.24] We can talk, right?
[1777.80] Till Hania doesn’t come,
 sit and talk to me.
[1780.24] I have to talk about something
 important to you.
[1787.16] Open the door, listen to me.
[1789.60] Hania, answer your phone. Hania.
[1812.28] Greetings.
[1815.28] Greetings.
[1816.92] Why did you take so long 
to come from work?
[1818.88] Did you have a lot of work?
[1820.52] No,
[1822.88] brother was not well.
[1825.48] I took him to the hospital.
[1828.08] God be kind, what happened?
 Where is brother?
[1832.12] I have made him lie in the room.
[1833.88] His blood pressure shot up
[1836.48] and why wouldn’t it shoot up,
[1839.92] when he got such a big tension 
in this age.
[1844.40] Someone has said it correctly,
[1847.36] there can be no greater test
[1851.76] for parents than the
 disobedience of children.
[1856.44] I don’t understand
[1859.20] why do we let it reach this point?
[1862.60] If the children are disobedient, then
[1864.64] the children are not the 
only ones to blame,
[1866.92] the parents should be
 blamed equally.
[1869.88] Now see, I have told sister
 in law so many times
[1873.08] not to give Ramsha such freedom.
[1876.76] What do you mean?
[1878.84] What do you want to say?
[1881.36] You lean to say that us parents 
keep the children caged?
[1885.80] Hmm
[1887.32] It is also the responsibility
 of the children.
[1889.60] If us parents give them freedom,
[1892.96] then it is their responsibility 
to take care of the freedom
[1895.88] and not to take undue advantage of it.
[1897.76] Yes, you are right. But
[1899.48] there is a big difference 
between freedom and disobedience.
[1903.48] When did I say you 
cage your children at home?
[1906.16] Or you don’t let them 
get out of the home.
[1908.24] I just say that at least the parents
[1911.88] should be this strict that
[1914.96] the parents and children
[1916.72] can be saved from any test.
[1920.76] Hey our grand parents 
were really lucky that
[1924.64] they used to stop us on everything
[1929.76] and we also used to accept it.
[1933.12] But the parents of today?
[1935.36] They cannot say anything to
 their children on their mistake.
[1940.36] Not children, but the parents
 are scared of their children getting upset.
[1947.72] You are absolutely right.
[1950.28] Really, we are really unlucky.
[1960.60] Anyway,
[1962.44] can you give me something to eat?
[1964.32] Okay, I will just bring it.
[1979.80] Hania, please come home soon.
[1985.84] See, I knew he would come.
[1996.44] Who is it?
[2000.64] Oh.
[2002.36] You?
[2004.24] Where is he? Where is he?
[2007.60] What are you doing, Ramsha?
[2009.68] What is wrong with you?
[2010.80] When did you come?
 Where is that Danish Kamal?
[2012.80] Where did he go?
[2013.40] What Danish Kamal?
[2015.32] If you come out then you
 will find out something.
[2018.00] You are scared like
[2019.32] if you had come out, 
he would have eaten you.
[2021.68] Danish Kamal…
[2022.72] Quiet.
[2024.64] I have been knocking on 
the door for so long,
[2026.24] I am calling you,
[2027.40] but you don’t hear me.
[2029.24] That is why I had to open
 the door the other way out of helplessness.
[2038.40] Okay, come on, keep this first.
[2040.96] Come here. Sit here.
[2047.84] What happened to you?
[2048.92] You were never so scared earlier,
[2050.60] what has happened to you now?
[2053.40] Earlier, mama and papa 
were there with me everywhere to protect me.
[2059.64] Now I am alone,
[2061.24] I have to protect myself.
[2063.52] I have to save myself 
from bad people,
[2066.16] and you know what 
sort of a man he is.
[2071.32] With what difficulty 
I have saved myself from him
[2076.08] I know all this.
[2079.48] No matter how many friends
 you have on the outside,
[2082.52] no matter how many people,
[2084.32] you feel alone without family.
[2092.32] But, you don’t worry,
[2094.56] I am with you. Come here.
[2153.16] I will make one more Tik Tok, 
then I will go and change.
[2155.72] Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare.
[2157.56] And don’t even look at the 
clothes that come for stictching for me.
[2161.60] But you never listen to me.
[2163.12] You are always engrossed 
in making the video.
[2165.96] I am going after
 making one video.
[2167.28] That’s it.
[2168.76] I am going.
[2233.64] This is the same Ramsha,
[2236.08] she grew up in front of our eyes.
[2239.12] I remember the day in the hospital,
[2240.96] when the nurse gave 
a doll in my hands
[2243.56] and said sir, you had a daughter.
[2245.92] And I thanked God,
[2248.24] that God thank you,
[2250.08] you gave us a blessing in our home
[2252.40] Hey, you should ask me,
[2254.24] who tolerated her every single day.
[2256.48] Your daughter has grown
 up with a lot of difficulty.
[2258.48] Do you see? Do you hear that?
[2260.24] She tolerates me daily.
[2261.72] It is good you heard it yourself.
[2263.32] hey, no child, your mother 
really loves you, she is joking.
[2267.24] I know, mama loves me the most.
