[24.48] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[27.28] Shall I say something? 
Hmm?
[30.52] You say that a husband and wife 
should share everything, right?
[34.76] So, is there anything you would like 
to share with me?
[45.88] I mean to say that something that 
you might not have told me
[50.04] because I am your wife now.
[54.40] What is this question all of a sudden?
[58.44] What a nonsensical thing to say, 
did someone say anything to you?
[64.44] No, like it happens often that
[67.32] boys befriend girls 
before marriage only,
[80.12] so, didn’t anything like that 
happen with you?
[85.48] With me?
[93.16] What is wrong with you?
[94.44] I guess you are forgetting that
[96.68] before becoming my wife you were 
my very good friend and my cousin.
[103.36] We have spent our entire life 
in this house together,
[106.48] whatever there is, it is in front of you,
what will I hide?
[122.84] Why do you look so worried, Afnan?
[125.88] Worried and I?
[129.16] Yes, Alizeh, I am worried
[131.60] but not because of you, 
this shipment,
[135.64] it needs to go out in time,
[137.48] you know dad gets upset.
[140.76] Will you have coffee?
[143.32] You have it.
[144.60] I am going to make coffee, 
I will make for you as well.
[158.44] Have you ever loved anyone 
except me?
[164.76] I mean we are human beings,
[166.44] and love can happen with anyone,
[168.84] no one has control on it.
[172.80] What?
[174.24] What is wrong with you?
[176.08] What is this time to ask 
all these questions?
[179.24] Afnan tell me?
[182.76] Have you ever loved any other girl?
[188.64] No, no.
[192.04] I have never even thought of 
any other girl except you.
[200.56] And as far as love is concerned,
[204.24] I have just loved you,
[206.88] just you.
[231.40] What are you cooking?
[233.20] I am making chicken and 
vegetable soup for uncle.
[235.60] Nice.
[237.44] By the way, you are mostly busy
 with Academy work or uncle.
[242.96] yes,
[244.36] I don’t even have anything else to do.
[246.88] Hmm, you are right.
[257.52] I feel that you should get married.
[271.84] Why are you looking at me 
so surprisingly?
[279.60] Everyone misses having 
a life partner in their life,
[288.60] until when will you live alone 
like this?
[291.52] You must get married too.
[297.32] I am okay like this.
[300.84] Ramsha, if you like someone,
you can tell me,
[312.36] why hide it from me?
[316.32] No,
[317.36] there is nothing like that, Alizeh.
[320.24] How is it possible?
[326.68] You must have liked someone 
at some point,
[336.68] there must be some person 
in your life
[344.88] who must have knocked on the door
of your heart.
[349.28] No there is no one.
[353.32] I cannot believe that,
[361.12] everybody for sure has someone 
like that in their life
[365.12] who they love
[371.80] or let’s say, they like.
[379.04] Have you never had anyone 
in your life
[382.20] who you want to marry?
[388.92] No.
[393.80] Is it like,
[395.84] the one you wanted to marry, 
married someone else?
[421.84] What happened Ramsha?
[424.24] Why did you get pale?
[428.96] No, nothing.
[484.96] Mom, that Alizeh has come.
[487.92] Alizeh who?
[489.48] That niece of Mr. Qasim?
[491.08] Yes, I have made her sit 
in the bedroom.
[493.08] You did, okay.
[497.44] My child, how is Mr. Qasim?
[499.40] And how is everyone at home?
[502.40] Yes, everyone is fine 
by the grace of God.
[504.28] And how is our Ramsha? 
Is she well?
[508.16] She must have sent you 
to know our wellbeing.
[515.64] It’s in her nature
[519.20] that she takes care of everyone, right?
[530.36] And it’s great that 
you came here to meet.
[534.60] Do you know I am very glad 
to see you here,
[543.48] it feels very nice to see that there is no pride
 at all in anyone in Mr. Qasim’s family,
[557.16] everyone meets very nicely 
by the grace of God.
[560.76] A person should be that way
[567.48] and I like such people.
[571.00] Thank you.
[572.88] Okay tell me,
[574.44] will you have a cold drink or 
shall I make tea for you?
[578.32] No, nothing.
[579.60] Why nothing?
[581.48] You sit down, I will go 
make tea for you.
[597.32] You are Ramsha’s cousin, right? 
You guys used to study together.
[600.68] I am not just Ramsha’s cousin 
but her friend too,
[602.88] a very good friend.
[608.72] When she used to be here, we used to 
talk a lot and have a lot of fun.
[612.72] Yes, Ramsha told me,
[614.64] you guys are very good friends,
[622.16] by the way, Ramsha is that good 
she become good friends with everyone,
[625.16] you know I and her have become 
good friends too.
[628.24] You are absolutely right,
[629.88] Ramsha has this talent of befriending,
[637.08] she talks so much that 
she befriends everyone.
[641.76] Yes, but now she has changed a lot,
[651.20] she always has sadness on her face,
[660.60] do you know she is not even ready
 to get married?
[665.24] Yes,
[667.36] Mom was telling she is not like 
before now,
[676.28] when a person’s heart breaks,
[678.52] they don’t remain the way they were.
[681.04] Boys are like that,
[682.40] I don’t know why girls do not 
understand this.
[687.60] Ramsha used to trust Afnan a lot.
[703.24] First that Afnan left her 
then aunt left the world,
[715.72] now she has lost trust in people
[727.92] which is why she is not ready to marry.
[733.48] Afnan?
[736.16] Hmm,
[737.48] Afnan.
[747.24] Ramsha used to love Afnan a lot,
[759.12] she even wanted to marry him
[769.44] but she didn’t have the companionship 
of Afnan in her fate.
[791.16] After lying so much and doing so much,
[794.76] what is she doing here, Afnan?
[797.92] Such girls are looking for a chance
to do a big robbery.
[801.16] What is wrong with you? 
What are you saying?
[804.84] You are quite educated., 
you have gotten good exposure as well,
[807.92] what has that girl done?
[810.08] The poor girl keeps on sitting
 in one corner all day.
[813.88] Since she has come here,
[815.12] she has never caused 
any harm to anyone,
[816.92] she hasn’t even moved a thing 
from its place
[819.64] and you are making such huge 
allegations about her.
[821.56] And you stop showing sympathy for her.
[824.16] Why do you always defend her so much?
[826.80] It is useless to argue with you.
[871.80] Come on, Alizeh, why doesn’t she
attend the phone?
[876.84] Bashir? 
Yes sir?
[878.16] Is Alizeh home? 
No, madam Alizeh is not home yet.
[882.76] Okay fine go. 
Okay.
[886.52] I even had the contact number 
of her office.
[889.80] Here it is.
[895.20] Hello greetings,
[897.20] Afnan speaking, I wanted to talk to Alizeh.
[902.16] Yes, I am her husband.
[906.40] Really?
[908.28] When did she leave the office?
[913.04] No, no, no, there is no such emergency,
[916.12] I will call her number.
[918.56] Thanks a lot. Bye.
[953.12] Come on, Alizeh, pick up the phone.
[976.04] Hey,
[977.96] what happened? 
Why have you come like this?
[979.48] You scared me.
[980.76] You should be scared 
because of your actions.
[985.36] What do you mean? 
You are saying that to me?
[988.00] So, do you see anyone else 
in this room, Afnan?
[991.48] But why are you saying this?
What has happened?
[995.76] Did you have any relationship 
with Ramsha or not?
[1005.48] Don’t lie to me, Afnan.
[1024.12] Alizeh, I think you have a 
huge misunderstanding,
[1027.72] there is nothing like you think.
[1029.72] Just answer my question,
[1031.64] did you know Ramsha or not?
[1039.00] Did you have any relationship 
with her or not?
[1042.64] what is wrong with you Alizeh?
[1044.56] Why are you talking like that and 
asking such questions?
[1047.52] Afnan, just answer my question,
[1050.28] did you know her or not?
[1052.48] Okay, Alizeh, you are very angry 
right now…
[1054.56] You are making me angrier, Afnan.
[1057.84] Answer my question.
[1060.88] Tell me.
[1062.44] I knew her
[1075.00] but I didn’t know her like this 
very closely,
[1077.92] I just had contact with her 
and nothing else,
[1080.16] I can explain this to you,
[1082.12] you, you, relax and listen to me.
[1084.64] Alizeh?
[1085.80] Alizeh? Where are you going? 
Tell me, Alizeh?
[1088.20] Look at the condition of my bike,
[1091.12] I am thinking to buy a new bike.
[1093.72] I’ll have to find a part time job.
[1095.56] Take money from your dad,
[1097.24] now he is the one getting all 
the money in his pockets.
[1100.28] Earlier you guys had to give bit 
to uncle Sajid,
[1102.68] now Uncle Sajid and his family 
is not there.
[1106.84] You are saying as if 
you don’t know my dad,
[1110.12] he has become 10 times more miser 
than he was.
[1115.28] Take it from your dad.
[1117.04] I am telling you that whatever needs 
to be done, I will have to do it on my own.
[1121.12] Dad won’t buy me a cycle let alone a bike.
[1124.56] Anyway, forget everything, tell me, 
is there any guest at your home?
[1130.60] There must be someone, 
why do you care?
[1134.24] Shani, I saw a huge car in front of 
your house today
[1137.00] and I saw a girl getting out of that car.
[1141.00] I was quite far so couldn’t see it properly
[1143.64] and I have never seen anyone coming to 
your house in such an expensive car ever before.
[1159.04] I will be right back.
[1159.92] Hey Shani, where are you going?
[1162.24] I’ll be back. 
At least finish your tea.
[1163.96] I will be back, I will be back, 
I will be back.
[1165.56] Hey? 
Give me 2 minutes.
[1167.24] Shani, stop.
[1171.44] Shani?
[1172.48] Hey, he didn’t even pay for tea.
[1186.16] Ramsha?
[1194.56] You shameless girl.
[1201.64] Don’t you feel any shame?
[1204.08] How can you betray us big time?
[1206.52] What have I done?
[1207.68] Hey, what is wrong with you? 
Come with me and talk.
[1210.56] What is wrong with me?
[1219.08] Yes, yes, you will come to 
save your lover.
[1235.52] What did you think?
[1236.84] Both of you could have fooled me
together
[1239.08] and I will keep on tolerating?
[1240.52] I wouldn’t be able to find out anything,
[1249.88] Fahad has told me the whole truth.
[1263.72] You could only find my husband 
to have an affair?
[1273.60] Alizeh, what are you saying?
[1275.44] Please there is nothing like that, 
please keep quiet,
[1277.00] don’t create a drama.
[1278.12] I am not creating any drama, 
you have made me a laughing stock.
[1287.56] How can you betray me big time?
[1290.52] Alizeh, what has happened to you? 
You have made me a laughing stock
[1292.40] in front of the whole world.  
Come talk to me.
[1294.24] What has happened to me?
[1303.64] What did you think I would 
never find out anything?
[1305.80] And you?
[1307.32] What is this attire, 
this scarf and all?
[1309.40] Alizeh, Alizeh? Alizeh, 
what has happened to you?
[1311.64] Have you gone crazy? 
Yes, I have gone crazy.
[1314.16] She is a hypocrite.
[1320.52] Didn’t you feel any shame doing all this?
[1322.44] Alizeh, stop, please don’t do this,
please get quiet.
[1325.52] Afnan, I should get quiet?
[1327.72] I should be the one who suffers wrongdoing 
and I am the one who should stay quiet too?
[1330.44] And you should have an affair with her?
[1343.88] You tell me how can you betray me 
big time like this?
[1355.88] Do one thing, strangle me
[1357.84] so I don’t say anything and I am not 
able to say anything at all
[1360.24] and then you can go wherever you want 
with this girl, hang out and have fun.
[1364.56] I can explain it to you, 
please listen to me.
[1368.12] you want me to stay quiet right,
[1370.08] just pray that I die,
[1379.52] because you have already killed me.
[1394.04] I don’t even want to see your face.
[1518.20] Hello?
[1519.12] Yes, where are you, Afnan?
[1520.64] I am in the office, is everything okay?
[1524.84] yes, I actually wanted to go out,
[1527.84] brother has taken the car 
so I thought I would go with you.
[1531.80] Oh, I am very busy, 
I have back-to-back meetings.
[1536.68] If you want, I can coordinate 
with the driver,
[1538.84] he will come to you.
[1540.20] No, no, it’s all right, 
I will manage.
[1542.48] Bye.
[1544.16] Listen, come, we are going somewhere.
[1546.28] No.
[1547.04] Come, I will also pick your bag. 
Come quickly, come. Come, come.
[1566.64] Oh,
[1568.24] so she is the same girl Ramsha,
[1576.24] that’s why I thought her face 
looked familiar to me.
[1585.64] How can I make such a huge mistake?
[1600.12] Hello brother, greetings,
[1603.40] I have been calling you for so long, 
but you weren’t attending.
[1607.84] Umm, brother, come home I need to
talk about something important to you.
[1613.40] Come home first, 
I will tell you in detail.
[1616.84] Please come home a little quickly.
[1619.36] Okay,
[1621.00] bye.
[1657.92] Mom, Ramsha did come here, right? 
You are hiding something from me, right?
[1664.92] Don’t you understand when I said it 
once that Ramsha didn’t come.
[1669.00] Mr. Qasim’s niece Alizeh came here,
[1673.08] would you only believe it 
if I write it down for you?
[1675.76] Why would his niece come here?
[1682.80] I know Ramsha came to this house 
she met you and Annie.
[1686.52] You are repeating the same thing again?
[1688.36] When you don’t trust 
what your mother is saying
[1690.48] then why are you asking? 
And you know it very well too
[1692.92] that Ramsha won’t come 
in this house ever now.
[1696.20] I am not convinced, I mean,
[1697.84] what does Mr. Qasim’s niece has 
to do with our home?
[1700.40] Ramsha must have sent her 
to know our wellbeing.
[1704.32] Oh, so Ramsha became so nice
[1706.20] that she sent Mr. Qasim’s niece 
to know our wellbeing?
[1710.80] Mom, say something one could believe.
[1717.60] I think something is not right,
[1721.04] I have this strange feeling.
[1724.32] Shani,
[1726.88] you are right.
[1734.76] Even I am finding all this 
to be very strange.
[1744.24] There is something.
[1745.72] Right?
[1786.72] Uncle, I have been betrayed big time,
[1790.12] I love Afnan so much and 
what did he do in return?
[1795.04] This is the reward he gave me.
[1802.88] I cannot bear it anymore now, uncle,
[1805.96] and all this is because of her.
[1812.52] I will kill her or I will kill myself.
[1814.52] My child, you go to your room. 
Go, go, go, my child.
[1817.92] Uncle, you get her out of this house,
[1820.28] I will not tolerate her for a day more,
I don’t want to see her face in this house.
[1824.44] Uncle, you will get her out, right?
[1826.32] yes, my child, we will do as you say
[1828.88] but you stop crying, please.
[1830.92] What have I done, uncle? 
I just loved Afnan.
[1835.12] Alizeh,
[1836.40] look my child, stop crying,
[1838.44] I will talk to Afnan when he comes back
but if you will cry like this,
[1841.04] I won’t be able to do anything.
[1842.36] what is my fault? 
Enough, enough, my child,
[1846.92] enough. Enough, enough.
[1851.20] Everything is destroyed.
[1879.96] You must have liked someone 
at some point,
[1883.72] there must be some person in your life
[1887.36] who must have knocked 
on the door of your heart.
[1891.76] No there is no one.
[1895.80] I cannot believe that,
[1901.24] everybody for sure has someone 
like that in their life
[1905.20] who they love
[1909.32] or let’s say, they like.
[1916.64] Have you never had anyone in your life
[1919.68] who you want to marry?
[1923.04] Is it like,
[1924.96] the one you wanted to marry, 
married someone else?
[1946.12] You shameless girl.
[1953.32] Don’t you feel any shame?
[1955.72] How can you betray us big time? 
What have I done?
[1959.08] Hey, what is wrong with you?
[1960.72] Come with me and talk. 
What is wrong with me?
[1966.88] Yes, yes, you will come 
to save your lover.
[1977.12] What did you think?
[1978.52] Both of you could have fooled me
together
[1980.88] and I will keep on tolerating? 
I wouldn’t be able to find out anything,
[1986.56] Fahad has told me the whole truth.
[1989.28] You could only find my husband 
to have an affair?
[2047.56] You haven’t left me capable to face 
my sister and niece.
[2055.96] Dad, I admit it is my fault
[2059.16] but trust me,
[2061.96] whatever contact I had with Ramsha 
is a part of my past,
[2065.64] there is no connection of it in the present. 
I know it, Ramsha has told me.
[2073.12] You didn’t even bother telling me.
[2082.88] Do you have any idea
[2084.88] what a wife goes through 
if she finds out
[2087.24] that her husband has relations 
with another girl, hmm?
[2090.88] You are the one responsible for 
Alizeh’s sorrows and her tears, Afnan.
[2095.12] Yes, but dad, I was just friends 
with Ramsha, nothing else.
[2097.84] What friendship?
[2099.04] When is there ever a friendship 
between a man and a woman, tell me?
[2107.12] There is always evil between a man 
and a woman,
[2109.64] that is what we have heard 
from our elders, right?
[2115.68] And his is the reason for the destruction
of society,
[2118.36] try to understand.
[2124.84] A relationship is what can be owned 
and respected
[2128.40] and that you can be proud of.
[2138.52] Anyway,
[2141.12] today the strict decisions that I have to 
take, I never wanted to do them
[2148.36] and you have forced me
[2156.00] so I have decided that
[2158.64] Ramsha will no longer live 
in this house now.
[2163.04] Ramsha won’t live here?
[2165.20] What are you saying, dad? 
How is that possible?
[2170.20] When I am the one at fault
[2172.00] then you cannot punish Ramsha for 
my mistake by putting her through this
[2176.08] and just imagine where will 
the poor girl go from here?
[2179.04] Her own home is not safe for her.
[2181.80] I have said that Ramsha won’t 
live here anymore.
[2186.88] Yes, dad but I am telling you that
 if you just once…
[2189.36] I won’t listen to you anymore now, Afnan.
[2193.88] I have told you that Ramsha 
won’t leave here now,
[2196.36] so, she won’t.
[2201.40] It is better if we don’t talk about this 
anymore.
[2205.20] Leave for now.
