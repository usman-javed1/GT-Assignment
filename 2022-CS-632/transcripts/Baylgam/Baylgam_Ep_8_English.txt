Alizeh, what is wrong with you? You are that upset? Look at me. Why are you making a big deal 
out of such a small issue? Listen, I cannot tolerate this behavior
 from you. I have been restless all night, 
I couldn’t even sleep because of you. You must not be able to sleep because 
you were missing someone. What? I am so sorry not at you but myself, in fact I feel sorry on my love for you that I cannot prove you how 
sincere I am with you, I cannot affect you that my love for you… Afnan, who was that girl? So, all this happening 
because of that girl? She was an acquaintance. I went to the restaurant 
so I met her there and just spoke to her for a while, and you are creating this huge fight 
for such an unimportant person? Unimportant girl? You lied to me for an unimportant girl? You could have told me the truth as well. I was joking. I was teasing you like usual. But the good thing about this is 
that I got to know that you love me and you love me a lot. Right? Okay enough now, how long will you remain upset? I swear to God! I will never do 
that again, okay? I have made coffee for you 
with so much love, it is getting cold, have it. How did you like it? Exactly like you, very nice. I thought you were about 
to say very bad. That is what I should have said. yes, you will find me bad right now, you don’t think I am bad when you ask me 
Afnan pick me from here, Afnan drop me there,
take me shopping. So what? I don’t force you. Oh, Thank God. What happened? I am just checking if you are okay?
Did something happen to you? God forbid, something happens to me. Whatever has to happen must 
happen to my enemies, why will anything happen to me? Idiot. Are you even in your senses Ramsha? I mean, all your senses are 
working fine, right? Annie, what is wrong with you? 
Why are you talking childish? I am absolutely fine,
 I can see you, I can even hear your voice, 
and I can even speak, should I cut my tongue off 
and show it to you? I am surprised how your craze for 
Mr. Afnan got away so quickly? What? What are you saying? 
Where did Afnan came from? I thought you must be going crazy 
for Afnan but when mom told me that you have 
agreed to marry brother… What, what, what? 
What are you saying? Agreed to marry brother? 
Are you out of your mind? Mom has told me, and I guess 
dad must have told mom. Are you mad? I will agree to marry your brother? 
Oh God! Forgive me. I will go and fix their brains right now. 
All of them have gone mad. What happened? 
mom, who has said that I agreed 
to marry Shani? actually, your uncle had some 
misunderstanding and you know your dad was really trying 
to make your uncle understand but he… Misunderstanding and that to for me? Go and refuse uncle right now. Tell him that I don’t want to marry Shani. I have asked your dad, 
he will talk to your uncle. Really? When? 
When will he talk? Now I understand, this is why your mom gave me 
the entire box of sweets, right? Look the matter has just happen, if we refuse immediately so your uncle 
will feel very bad that is why your father will talk, 
don’t worry. what is wrong with you all? 
Mom? Ramsha, brother is actually very happy,
aunt is right. Yes, look poor Shani was ready, 
he was the one who asked. The boy is very happy. Shani did? I will crush this Shani 
with my own hands. Hey? What is wrong with her? She has been after my brother. Afsheen? Do you want to say something? Brother I will come again. No, no, sit down, sit, sit. I have an idea that you are also worried for children. Brother I have tried talking to Alizeh but she doesn’t give me any response. You must talk to Afnan, in fact I would suggest that you make them
 sit in front of you and talk clearly. You are right, I am thinking the same. The air in the home is becoming strange, there used to be such happy environment 
in the house because of these children. Absolutely. Umm, tell Mr. Afnan that I am calling him Okay. in fact, tell Madam Alizeh as well, 
that I am calling her. okay fine. brother, we got them hitched with 
so much love and pride and I thought that my daughter will 
stay in front of my sight but everything is going 
upside down here. Don’t worry I will talk to both of them. Yes, uncle? 
You called me? Yes I did, sit down. Is everything okay Dad? 
Did you call me? Sit down. I have called both of you here. I have made a huge mistake 
by getting you two to marry, this is why I have decided 
to end this relation. What? Dad, what? What are you saying? Are you joking? Why are you saying this? Because you don’t like each other. We had a misunderstanding 
that is why we have decided… No, no uncle, there is nothing like that. Then what is it, my child? What is it? You don’t even tell me and 
keep on fighting, you don’t care about your elders. We think we are concerned for you 
and you don’t care about us. Sorry, uncle. What sorry? Dad, 
dad I can explain it to you. We had a misunderstanding
 between us, it got a bit dragged but we have sorted it out
and we are both very happy together. Dad seriously, please don’t 
end this relationship. brother, please ask Alizeh as well because I can’t really judge her mood, she might refuse to marry if she dislikes
anything Afnan would say in future. I mean, like it’s not marriage 
but some sort of a game. Mom, please, what is wrong with you? Just think and then respond. Now we can’t do this that we should run
 after you and then him. Uncle, you don’t have to run 
after anyone, we have sorted it out between us, 
there is no problem now. Say it. Yes, we have sorted it out. 
We are good. Ramsha, listen to me? Where are you going? 
Where are you going? I am going to fix your 
mad brother’s brain. Please Ramsha, try to understand that he is very happy, if you will just go 
and say everything to him like this, he will get very sad. Are you serious. Annie? You care about your brother 
and not me? I care about you as well but Ramsha, aunt has said
that she will talk to uncle and uncle will tell everyone 
the truth himself so brother will find out too. This is all my fault, I should have said no 
in front of everyone so that no one would have 
misunderstood anything and your brother wouldn’t be falsely happy 
because of this misunderstanding that, I… I will marry him. Okay, okay, don’t marry brother at all, 
don’t do it but please just stay quiet for now, 
and go in your room for now. Annie, I am very angry 
at your brother right now so it’s better that you go inside else I will forget that 
you are my friend because right now you just seem 
to be Shani’s sister to me. I won’t spare your brother today, 
just wait and watch. Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? Dude! 
Oh God please save brother. Shani! Shani? Shani? Shani? Where are you? What happened? 
Why are you so angry? What did you think 
I would come here and shyly say that Shani, why didn’t you say it to me 
if you liked me? Oh my God! Shani I am so lucky! How dare you liked me? Okay fine if you liked me, I am beautiful and pretty too, any boy can fall for me so what does that mean that you will ask your mom 
to take proposal for me? Ramsha, you are my cousin, why are you getting so mad about it? And uncle was saying that 
you accepted the proposal? There was a misunderstanding, Dad went to refuse uncle and 
uncle didn’t even listen to dad that is why you all thought that 
misunderstanding was a yes, that is why I thought myself that I should come here myself 
and fix your brain. I, Ramsha, do not want to marry you. Did you hear that? And have you ever seen yourself?
 Yeah? Have you ever seen yourself 
you look so weird, you don’t even know 
the ABCs of education, you uneducated man, just passing matric doesn’t make
one educated. And how did you even think that I, such a beautiful girl will marry you? Actually I… 
Enough! Just shut up! Because when you speak, 
I feel pain in my ears. Have you seen yourself? 
You don't have the manners to talk, to sit or to walk! You have no manners 
at all and what do you wear? If you look at the boys 
from good families you will then know the way 
of speaking and sitting! Like you are someone 
who can marry me. Ramsha, I love you. To hell with your love, I have shown you your place 
in person today, next time if you even talk about love, I will humiliate you in front of everyone
 so that you will remember it for life. You can only dream about a beautiful girl
like me, Mr. Shani, not in your life for real! Do keep that in your mind! Oh God! You just use TikTok 24 hours. Haww mom? 
Shut it down. I made such a nice TikTok, what have you done? 
Couldn’t you see? You ruined it. Tell me what did you say to Shani? What have you said to him? Shani, I haven’t said anything. Why? Ramsha, don’t lie. it means he couldn’t be patient and 
he came and told you everything immediately. What a snitcher! Enough, for God’s sake, enough! And whatever you are doing, you could have thought before doing it 
that we are elders and we are in this house, we didn’t die, 
we could have spoken to them, Salma was very angry 
because of what you did. Aunt Salma just needs a chance 
to get angry at me and that too for no reason. 
Really? Salma is mad that she gets angry 
on you for no reason. Haw! See, you spoke your heart, 
you said it. For God’s sake Ramsha, 
enough now. I get really embarrassed 
because of what you do. And there is no shame in your eyes,
I guess. And this dress, you just bought it and 
you are already wearing it and then when we have to go out somewhere,
you never have clothes. Now turn this off and help me 
in the kitchen. They don’t know that 
TikTok stars don’t work, they just make TikToks. Did you ask sir what we have to make? Yes, yes. Okay, I am going to go take this call, 
I will be back in two minutes, you guys just stay here, okay? Wait., Let me try and call, 
Afnan might pick my call. Oh god! She is bothering me 
by constantly calling. I have to do something about her. Hello. Hello? Thank God, you picked my call, Afnan. Because I know you aren’t going 
to leave my life like that. Really? That is how much 
you dislike me? No, not that much but a little bit. Do you actually dislike me? Ramsha, I am going for a meeting, and I don’t like when someone disturbs me
 in the middle of work. Okay you tell me why are you worried? Thank God that you didn’t say 
that why are you worrying me, else my heart would have broken. Really? That’s how weak your heart is? Yes, it is a little two weak about you. Okay, we will try it sometime. No, no, Afnan, never do anything 
like that ever. I won’t be able to bear. Where do you learn all this from? Sometimes I feel you are habitual
 of talking like this. Haww! No, what do you think I talk to everyone 
like this apart from you? I don’t know, but I find all this a little weird and I like it a little too that is why 
I talk to you. Hmm, after saying all this when you said
 that you like it a little, I really liked hearing that. okay now, I have reached the meeting, I am going inside, 
I will talk to you later. Bye. Okay, bye. Annie? Annie, dude. Annie, listen to me? 
What happened? You are still mad at me? 
Stop now. You wouldn’t have done all this 
had you care, Ramsha. What is wrong with you guys? If I don’t like your brother 
then I just don’t, I have just refused that then 
why is everyone getting so mad? Okay just leave it, 
let’s go to the canteen. I mean just let this topic go, 
let’s go to the canteen, come. Come. Just keep on doing this, work all day and then get tired 
and sleep. Don’t you want to go? Where? Shopping, for engagement shopping. What are we wearing for the engagement,
what should we buy, we know nothing. Afnan forgot, mom told me. hmm so now what are you thinking?
We are getting late, let’s go. Afnan, I am very tired right now, shall we go tomorrow? Oh! Why don’t you quit this job? 
You are always tired because of it. Afnan please, I don’t even have the energy 
to argue with you right now. okay fine, fine, don’t argue, but you can atleast get leaves 
a few days before engagement? But why? Who takes leaves for 
engagement Afnan? What do you even say? And I am very tired today, 
we will just go tomorrow. Okay. As you wish. Salma, I have talked to Ramsha, look this will never happen again. You know her very well, she is a girl, she is naïve, she has no etiquette 
about good or bad. Look sister-in-law, 
I will forgive her because she is exactly like my Annie but no one else will do the same. If her behavior remains the same, she has to get married and 
go to another home, how will you keep on giving 
explanations to everyone? Yes, you are absolutely right by the way, I am always worried 
when I think about it. Look if Ramsha and Shani would have 
gotten married, it was just better for Ramsha because she is the girl from our home only 
and we are habitual of how she is, but no one else will tolerate 
such behavior and talks. You know that very well, in laws make girls go through 
the worst for every little thing. No one will tolerate her 
behavior at all, only I and you can forgive her 
saying she is a little girl, no one else will, 
you must understand this. How much more will you 
make me wait? We are just waiting for dad, 
we will leave once he is here. You just quietly sip your coffee 
meanwhile. I can’t sit quietly, shut this off and talk about something. So, then you must talk, 
who is stopping you? I cannot stop working. May I come in sir?
Yes, yes come in. Sir these are some checks that 
need to be delivered today, I needed signatures of Mr. Qasim, 
he hasn’t come, so can you sign them? No, no, I cannot sign them 
without asking dad, do one thing, let’s wait for dad if he doesn’t come 
then I will sign. Keep them here. All right sir. Thank you. You are welcome. Who are you talking to? No one, it was a marketing message. So, tell me about your new friend? Are you still going good with her? Yes, it is going well but I am just thinking of calling 
it quits now. You know Alizeh saw me with her, she got really angry, I almost got in trouble and got out 
if it with so much difficulty. okay then let her be, do one thing, make me friends with her. Fahad, have you just developed this habit 
of interfering in others matters or has it been since childhood? Hey, why do you have a problem? You are calling it quits with her, so then what difference does it 
make to you? it doesn’t make any difference to me, 
and why would it? But she was a very interesting 
personality, you know before meeting her I thought it’s just us boys who lie to the girls, but she was amazing, she would say such things, 
will lie so much, I used to be amused. So much time would pass by laughing
with her that I wouldn’t even realize. That is why I was developing 
interest in her. Was? That means it’s not anymore? Or the interest has increased? No, no I have no interest. What would I even do with her? I want to spend my life with Alizeh 
and everyone knows that, I know it myself too so what is the point of wasting 
some other girls time then? Right? I am telling you, I have never interacted with 
that type of girl so I was liking it, she was different, 
that’s it. Look, just be sure that things don’t go 
in a way where you find someone different today, it gets difficult to part ways from them. Brother, stop having coffee, come with me I will get you coffee
 from somewhere outside. Dad must be in the mosque, let’s go to him I need his signatures 
on this as well. We are going to the mosque? 
yes, we are going to the mosque, are you not allowed? Greetings. 
Greetings. Greetings Uncle.  
Greetings, greetings, so glad to see you here. Umm sorry dad we came here and disturbed you 
but the there was an important work, I just needed your sign 
on the checks. No problem, show me. Let me check. Yes, these checks, show me. I actually forgot signing the checks and it was very important to 
dispatch these checks today. Yes. 
Here. Thank you. Yes, let’s go. 
I was saying that now you have entered the house of God then also offer congregational prayer. Why not dad, absolutely. We will go perform ablution. 
Stay blessed. Go. Come, come. Check out the video,
I got 25k views. My God. Look at her videos, 
she makes such weird videos. Yes. 
I just laugh when I watch… Annie? What is going on here? Nothing brother, I was just sitting. You sit like this all day, either you are always on your mobile
 or you are talking, if I ever see a phone 
in your hand again, I will throw it away. 
Do you understand? This is not my phone, brother, 
this is Ramsha’s phone. Yes. And if you even think about 
breaking my phone, I will break your head, 
do you understand? You know me very well, right? Mind your own business! 
I didn’t talk to you. Huh! And why are you standing here 
and watching? Go help mom in the kitchen. Go. 
okay brother, I am going. Ever since I have refused 
to marry your brother, he has become so bitter about me. I will take a selfie, a very nice, 
beautiful selfie. Oh wow. Poor thing. Peace be upon you and 
God’s mercy and blessings. Peace be upon you and 
God’s mercy and blessings. Afnan?
Hmm? What’s up? You are having coffee alone? When do you have time for me? Afnan? I and all my time is just for you. Trust me. Really? Are you serious? hmm. You look very beautiful today. Hmm? hmm, very beautiful, what was I thinking that… Whose call is it? What was I saying? Whose call is it? Someone I know, a very unimportant man. He has been calling since a while 
I wasn’t taking it, I got sick and turned it off. Look, if he is unimportant 
he cannot be a friend and if he is a friend 
he cannot be unimportant. so I have said he is not my friend. He is just an acquaintance, through a friend we went for a business 
meeting at lunch so I met him there, they were mutual friends so 
I got to talk to him as well, so then I spoke to him 
because of that and he took my number and now 
he is annoying me to get his work done. I can’t do all this. So Afnan, you must refuse him, this is wrong now, he is calling you,
you gave him your number yourself. You are not even taking his call, 
it’s bad. it is so sad by the way Why? I was talking to you so romantically, I never expected a lecture. Okay tell me, will you have coffee? Umm yeah. I am scared, I cannot have coffee alone now so I will immediately go and 
make coffee for you. Okay. By the way, if you wouldn’t have 
come to meet me today, I would have gotten so mad at you. That would have been great because even I am thinking 
to stop talking to you now. Haww! Why? What? What are you thinking? Tell me? I am thinking that if I hadn’t come to meet you would 
you actually stop talking to me? Yes absolutely. If you wouldn’t meet me or talk to me 
then why would I talk to you? And by the way it has been 
so many days, you should know me well by now. That’s absolutely right but you will be surprised to hear that I haven’t just got to know you but 
I have also judged you very well now. What do you mean? nothing. Tell me something, what will you eat? 
Where should we go? You tell me that what will you eat
 if you are hungry? To be honest, I am not hungry at all. Okay then let’s do one thing, 
let’s sit and talk a lot. Okay, say it. Saba? 
Yes? Have you seen Ramsha? Yes, she has left. What do you mean by she left? 
Where is she? It has been an hour since she left. 
I saw her going there. okay, fine, thank you. Hello?
Yes Ramsha? Where are you? I am waiting for you in the auto Rickshaw
 outside, can you come a little quickly? You didn’t take your class? 
Saba was telling you left an hour back? Yes, I was with him, Afnan. Ramsha, are you out of your mind? Now you have started doing all this? Annie, don’t argue all the time, 
I am waiting in the rickshaw, it has been so late, we even have 
to go home, hurry up. okay I am coming, 
what does this girl do? Come, come, come. I am so happy, so happy, 
so happy. Oh god! You will get in trouble and get me 
in trouble with you as well. my love, the ones who love are not afraid of dying,
do you understand? So then die alone, 
don’t take me with you. If you had to go with Afnan, 
you could have told me once. I called you 100 times, you switch off your phone 
when you go in the class and if I would have waited 
for your class to end, I would have missed this chance. And you know Afnan is always so busy, I got a chance to meet him 
after so much difficulty today. Ramsha, fix yourself. okay leave all that, tell me if your mom has some nice Saree. Now where do you want to go in Saree? I will make a video. you are the limit Ramsha, what is wrong with you Annie? 
Do even know that people do so much to 
make videos nowadays. Do you remember that girl 
went viral on TikTok, she climbed a mountain to make a video 
and she even lit fire there And do you remember 
what happened to her? She had to suffer in prison and 
then she even got defamed. So what? We have to do anything to get viral 
these days even get defamed, it’s not a big deal. And by the way no one knew that girl, after she made that video, she got 
so many views and everyone knew her. Will you burn this house 
to get your video viral? What is wrong with you, Annie? 
I have no such plans and please get me a good Saree 
of your mom, I will return after making a video. Mom doesn’t have any Saree and even if she did, 
I wouldn’t have brought it for you. Mom is absolutely right, girl and boys 
have ruined themselves after social media. You won’t bring it for me? No I won’t. 
Get lost. Go. Okay. What will I do about the Saree now? I will wear Mom’s Saree. Oh God! Ramsha! You ruined my cupboard. Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? oh God! Mom, you ruined, 
my TikTok again? What happens to you? Atleast watch out, 
you just get strated. I am watching your acts very vividly and who asked you to get a Saree 
from my cupboard? Come on, go and change. And I have told you that girls in our family do not wear 
Saree before marriage. What is wrong? I just wore it for TikTok, I am not wearing and roaming around
the house in it, mom. I will burn your mobile. Come on, you will ruin my new saree, 
go and change. Oh God! Mom, you are such a liar, new Saree? You wore it at your younger 
uncle’s wedding and it has been 12 years 
since his marriage now. So how many times have I worn it? Hardly once or twice. So then say you have worn it 
multiple times. I don’t want to argue with you, 
you go, go. Mom, give me 10 minutes, 
I will just make two more TikToks, I have worked so hard in getting ready,
don’t do this. Ramsha, I won’t give you even a minute. Go change right now. Okay, just 5 more minutes, 
I will just make one more TikTok, I worked so hard in getting ready. And listen, go set my cupboard
 after changing, and if you touch anything 
from my cupboard again, you will see what I do to you. Go. No.  
Go, go and change. Why are you pushing me? Go in front of me and change right now,
come on. I am going. 
Hurry up. She ruined my Saree.
