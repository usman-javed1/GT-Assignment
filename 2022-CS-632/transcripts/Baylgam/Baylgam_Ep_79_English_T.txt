[23.24] For Go’s sake open the door,
[26.96] Uncle must be worried for me,
[30.40] I still haven’t reached home, 
he must be worried.
[34.96] Why have you locked me here?
[37.68] is there anyone here or not?
[41.72] Someone, please come here.
[46.04] I want to go home.
[51.68] Why have you locked me here?
[53.24] Is there anyone here to tell me? 
Is there no one to help me here?
[57.92] Oh God, help me,
[62.08] Oh God, help me.
[96.60] Mr. Qasim,
[98.60] I really apologize a lot for 
what my constable did.
[103.28] It is not your constable’s fault.
[113.88] I am an aged ordinary man,
[119.80] and who asks a common man
 these days?
[125.04] I am really sorry,
[127.56] Mr. Qasim, I have noted your complaint.
[135.84] We will try our best to find your daughter.
[148.44] It is very late now,
[150.48] you must go home and rest.
[156.68] The fear won’t let me sleep, Mr. DSP.
[167.92] I took responsibility of that girl,
[175.72] I promised the Almighty God that 
I would take care of her.
[182.28] What will I answer God 
if something happens?
[190.64] Okay, I am aged and old,
[195.20] no one listens to me
[198.52] but God will definitely listen to me.
[206.80] He listens to everyone’s requests.
[209.96] Umm, okay let me drop you to the car.
[211.92] No, no, if you can do something,
[216.40] just help that girl,
[219.00] find her,
[225.52] don’t worry about me,
[228.52] I have spent my life
[231.20] and I will somehow totter and 
manage to reach,
[237.20] it’s just that girl is my responsibility, 
Mr. DSP, you find her.
[245.12] That girl also wants to see 
the colors of life,
[248.72] my time is near.
[253.64] God will listen to my request,
[255.72] He loves us more than 70 mothers,
[258.40] He will listen to me, 
He listens to everyone.
[287.68] Greetings, may peace be upon you. 
Greetings,
[291.24] is everything okay brother, 
where were you?
[294.20] Did you find anything about Ramsha?
[296.28] I didn’t find anything about Ramsha
[298.72] but I spoke to Mr. DSP, 
and he has ensured
[302.08] he will find Ramsha soon 
by the grace of God,
[304.96] I even searched for her at the hospitals,
[306.80] but didn’t find anything about her
 anywhere.
[308.80] Yes, that what is I was thinking that, 
why did you get late.
[313.12] Actually, I called you so many times,
[316.20] you even left your phone at home.
[318.24] You were even getting a lot of calls here.
[323.84] Brother,
[325.76] if you will worry so much about Ramsha,
[328.60] you will get sick like this.
[338.24] Look,
[339.44] God forbid, if Ramsha had met
 any accident,
[342.56] some accident,
[344.28] so we would have at least gotten 
a call from the hospital
[353.68] or if she was kidnapped,
[358.64] someone would have definitely 
called for ransom.
[369.00] Now, brother whatever the situation 
is right now,
[372.44] it evidently shows that
[376.04] she has left by her choice.
[379.00] What do you keep on saying, 
Afsheen?
[381.72] Why would she leave without telling?
[393.52] May God keep things well,
[396.48] just pray to God that things are well.
[475.92] When I started to walk on this path
[479.84] and start learning about religion, 
I felt a very solid change,
[485.04] I felt nice.
[490.56] When you walk on the path of religion
and study religion,
[494.60] your faith in God increases.
[497.36] Faith in God.
[502.84] The one who has faith in God,
[506.08] all the fears go away from their life.
[517.20] You know we ask God to give us 
a chance to offer prayers,
[522.68] we ask God to show us 
the right path, right?
[528.60] And any person, any person of God,
[532.88] when they repent with a true heart
[536.76] so all these mistakes and sins 
are washed away you know how?
[542.24] Like we wash clothes, 
properly drain them,
[545.60] or like we wash the dishes with a 
sponge or a detergent or a powder,
[551.20] similarly, these tears that are 
shining in your eyes,
[554.88] they wash away the stains like this,
[557.56] if God sees two drops of tears
 in anyone’s eyes
[563.60] and if they offer prayers of forgiveness, 
God forgives them.
[591.20] Will anyone tell me 
where is the Qiblah?
[593.44] I need to make ablution, 
I need to offer prayers.
[599.88] Can anyone hear me?
[603.68] OH God, what trouble 
have I gotten into?
[625.56] Oh God,
[627.60] please accept my prayers,
[630.76] I don’t know where I am and 
who has kidnapped me,
[636.28] I don’t know what is my fault 
but you help me,
[641.64] Oh God, help me out of this trouble,
[645.16] bring ease for me in this difficulty,
Uncle must be worried,
[650.72] get me home, my Lord,
[652.68] make my way easy,
[656.16] save me from these bad people,
[659.60] give me patience, 
make my way easy.
[715.40] Where did this Afnan go?
[770.00] Afnan?
[773.84] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[777.56] Why are you sleeping here?
[780.80] Is Ramsha back?
[784.52] No.
[792.36] Afnan, if she had to stay here, 
why would she leave at first place?
[803.20] But why are you sleeping here 
because of her?
[811.92] Come on, get up and come 
inside the bedroom,
[814.96] I have been waiting for you 
for so long.
[819.08] Okay.
[854.72] Brother,
[856.68] your blood pressure is very high,
[860.40] why are you hurting yourself 
for Ramsha?
[864.40] You will get unwell like this.
[872.32] You didn’t sleep all night, please 
brother have mercy on yourself.
[882.20] It is not anyone’s fault that 
Ramsha has gone now.
[886.20] What do you mean by she is gone, 
where did she go?
[895.44] What a weird thing to say.
[897.28] Brother, we are all trying
[901.04] but all this won’t bring her back.
[911.04] Please take care of yourself.
[914.16] You didn’t sleep all night. 
Please try to sleep.
[991.12] Afnan didn’t come, Alizeh?
[996.56] Mom,
[998.36] you said that Ramsha will also 
get out of Afnan and Uncle’s heart
[1001.56] once she leaves the house
[1004.40] but both of them father and son 
are mourning because she left.
[1008.44] You don’t take tension, 
things will go as I said.
[1012.24] How should I not take tension?
[1013.72] I guess you don’t know how 
Afnan is behaving right now.
[1017.76] He is reacting as if his wife has left
 this house instead of Ramsha.
[1022.40] I cannot tolerate all this.
[1024.88] Alizeh, you are one hell of 
an emotional girl
[1027.44] and you don’t have patience at all,
[1029.56] everything will happen 
but with time,
[1032.20] everything cannot happen immediately.
[1034.76] Actually, all this is very easy 
for you to say,
[1037.48] because you haven’t seen Afnan yet,
that is why.
[1043.24] Mom, by the way,
[1045.64] will you agree to one thing that I say?
[1047.96] Sure, tell me.
[1050.56] Mom, you call them and 
ask them to kill Ramsha.
[1054.96] Ssshhh!
[1057.64] Are you mad?
[1059.52] I am being honest,
[1060.96] I will only get peace in my life 
when she is dead else,
[1063.56] I will always be worried like this,
you get her killed.
[1066.80] Speak slowly,
[1070.56] we will be in so much trouble 
if someone hears you.
[1074.08] Nothing will happen to Ramsha but 
you will definitely get us both killed.
[1078.32] Fool!
[1097.80] How can Ramsha go anywhere 
without informing?
[1101.36] She is a responsible girl,
she is not careless.
[1104.88] This is not possible,
[1107.40] she is definitely in some trouble,
 or difficulty
[1109.60] and my heart is sinking 
thinking about it.
[1111.76] Hey brother, please control yourself.
[1116.68] Alizeh has just called all her 
academy friends
[1121.48] but there is no clue about 
Ramsha anywhere.
[1124.92] Don’t worry, Afnan will come some 
news with him by the grace of God.
[1132.04] What did you say that Afnan will come
with some information?
[1137.80] Why don’t you say that he will bring 
Ramsha along, by God’s will?
[1144.36] Afsheen?
[1146.36] Do you know something? 
Tell me?
[1434.48] Ramsha, you didn’t do good with me,
[1439.08] you shouldn’t have done that to me.
[1444.28] Why did you do this to me?
[1448.04] Why Ramsha, why?
[1451.24] I will never forgive you,
[1454.92] never ever,
[1457.24] never.
[1474.76] She ran away with her lover.
[1476.76] You shut up.
[1478.96] By the way I am surprised and 
a bit sad for you as well,
[1482.96] about the fact that I thought
you are her only lover,
[1488.04] but there are more here.
[1489.32] Shut up!
[1492.04] I’ll pull your tongue if you say one bad
 word about Ramsha’s character.
[1497.28] And you think I am wearing 
bangles here?
[1499.84] I won’t do anything in return? 
Hey?
[1502.32] For God’s sake, quiet, 
go away from here, Shani, go.
[1504.76] Ask him to leave from here.
[1506.08] Shut up, I am asking you to leave,
[1508.68] go away from here.
[1519.36] Yes, I am talking about Ramsha,
[1521.40] what were you talking to her about?
[1523.56] Who are you to ask me that?
[1525.36] She is a friend,
[1528.00] it is up to me whatever I say to her.
[1530.72] What?
[1531.96] She is your friend? 
She is your friend?
[1533.72] She is more than a friend.
[1540.44] Why should I tell you?
[1546.80] Mind your own business. 
Do you understand?
[1553.80] Did someone come to meet you 
at the academy today?
[1557.36] No, why?
[1560.12] Yes, because I was thinking that your 
relatives don’t come to meet you at home,
[1566.04] so there is a possibility that any of your 
relatives came to meet you at the academy.
[1574.00] No one came to meet me Afnan.
[1577.72] And I don’t have any relatives 
in this world now anyway,
[1582.72] so someone’s presence and absence 
don’t make any difference to me.
[1612.20] Mr. Qasim’s blood pressure and
heartbeat is very high,
[1617.92] it’s better if you get him 
out of this stress,
[1620.76] else if the condition remains the same,
[1623.12] we will have to shift him 
to the hospital.
[1631.52] No doctor, that is not possible.
[1641.20] I tried to convince Dad but 
he is not agreeing to go to the hospital,
[1653.60] please add something to his medication
[1656.44] that makes his condition better at home.
[1659.32] It’s not so easy,
[1671.36] we cannot give high doses 
to Mr. Qasim at his age,
[1690.52] and look medicine only works
[1693.80] when the patient himself 
wants to get well.
[1701.24] So then doctor, 
how will brother get well?
[1712.24] Because he is not sleeping, eating,
[1714.76] or taking medicines either, 
I am so tensed.
[1719.28] Look,
[1721.16] I haven’t seen the will to live 
in Qasim’s eyes.
[1744.44] He has become quiet.
[1748.56] I did his check-up.
[1764.40] He is quiet and this silence is not good 
for his health.
[1780.16] I think, it is serious advice to you all,
[1784.60] that keeps him away from stress, 
talk about good things with him,
[1788.48] happy things.
[1803.08] Anyway, I will come in the evening 
and check him again, okay?
[1807.68] Okay, doctor. 
Thank you.
[1809.04] Come, doctor, let me see you off.
[1810.72] Okay bye.
[1826.84] That is why I was against 
since the very first day
[1828.76] that this girl should stay in our home.
[1831.44] Uncle wouldn’t have been 
attached to her
[1833.24] and he wouldn’t be in this condition 
today either.
[1844.12] Obviously Alizeh,
[1846.08] Ramsha has just used brother 
for her purpose,
[1864.44] and look she showed her true colors.
[1877.56] But let me tell you something,
[1879.60] I have never seen a selfish girl 
like Ramsha.
[1905.12] Ramsha, you?
[1907.92] Alizeh, 
Alizeh.
[1921.80] Ramsha.
[1935.80] What are you doing here?
[1938.32] Where are you coming from?
[1958.72] What happened?
[1959.96] That guy left you 
who you ran with?
[1981.64] Obviously,
[1983.28] now just because that guy left you,
you have no other house to go to,
[1985.92] so you came back here.
[2011.56] Why?
[2012.88] Didn’t you think of brother’s honor 
at all? Yeah?
[2028.44] Or the guy’s family refused 
to accept you,
[2031.60] obviously who will accept such girls?
[2036.00] Which guy?
[2058.04] Who are you talking about?
[2071.60] I didn’t run away with any boy,
[2074.44] I got kidnapped, don’t you guys
 know that?
[2100.32] Some people kidnapped me, Alizeh,
[2103.52] Alizeh knows it, all of this happened 
in front of Alizeh.
[2124.76] Tell Alizeh, you didn’t tell all of them
[2127.20] that they kidnapped me 
in front of you.
[2129.28] What is she saying? 
What stories are you telling?
[2133.20] Alizeh,
[2134.64] we were both in the car,
[2136.24] come people stopped their car 
in front of our car,
[2138.72] they dragged me and kidnapped me,
[2141.00] and in front of you, you were even 
stopping them,
[2143.12] you didn’t tell anyone anything, 
why aren’t you telling them?
[2146.36] Please, don’t lie.
[2165.88] I am being very honest,
[2168.04] something has happened to you, 
I don’t know why are you lying.
