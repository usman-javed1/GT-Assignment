[17.24] Ramsha, how are you here?
Afnan,
[19.68] Afnan how are you?
Are you well?
[22.12] Where did you get hurt?
[23.60] Afnan, how, how did this all happen?
Afnan you…
[25.80] I am absolutely fine,
I met an accident Ramsha,
[32.68] I am sorry I didn’t have
my phone on me
[35.08] So I couldn’t tell you but how come
you are here and all this?
[96.04] I feel sad about myself,
[99.88] you went through so much difficulty
and came here to meet me and I,
[106.32] I couldn’t even inform you
about this,
[110.40] I know you love me a lot
but I am absolutely fine,
[114.04] I am absolutely fine, nothing
has happened to me,
[115.88] it’s just a matter of few days,
[117.24] everything will be back to normal
like before, you just go from here.
[121.32] No, no, no, I won’t go anywhere
from here, Afnan,
[124.16] I can’t leave you and go anywhere,
[126.00] I will stay close to you and
take care of you
[128.28] and all this has happened
because of me anyway, Afnan.
[131.20] How has this all happned
because of you?
[133.12] I gave you somuch tension and
because of me you met an accident.
[138.96] I want to live near you.
[140.84] Ramsha, don’t hold yourself
responsible,
[143.48] nothing has happened to me,
I am absolutely fine.
[146.72] Everything will be like before
in a few days.
[153.60] You are the one who says,
[155.20] there is always God’s expedience
in everything.
[157.48] So then there must be expedience
of God that I am here.
[161.04] Don’t push me away from you, Afnan,
[163.08] let me stay near you,
please Afnan.
[165.48] Okay why are you crying.
Afnan, careful.
[167.88] it’s nothing, nothing, nothing.
[169.60] Afnan, careful, what are you doing?
Why are you crying?
[172.64] I am saying everything is fine,
[174.56] I am absolutely fine,
this is a minor injury,
[177.56] doctor has just made me wear this
for no reason.
[179.32] You must go, it won’t be good
if someone sees you here right now.
[183.64] I won’t go anywhere from here,
[185.84] I will stay with you and
take care of you,
[188.52] and by the way I am your wife,
[191.24] I have right on you,
[193.28] you can’t take away my right from me,
Afnan,
[195.52] don’t ask me to go away from you,
I won’t go anywhere.
[197.76] Okay, I am not taking
any right away from you.
[202.40] I promised you,
[205.56] I will get you your honor and
I will do that anyhow.
[215.72] I won’t break my promise.
[227.92] Just stay strong for a few days,
[231.40] everything will be fine,
stop crying,
[233.72] you know I cannot tolerate you crying.
[239.84] You made the soup yourself?
[241.56] Yes.
[242.80] it must be very bad.
[245.56] Afnan. Try it.
[247.28] Shall I feed you?
[266.28] Not bad.
[277.00] All your prayers get answered right?
[279.92] So I was thinking if you can
pray for me too?
[285.60] Whenever I pray
I always pray for you.
[291.52] Yes but
[294.20] there is one prayer that
I especially want you to make.
[298.28] What?
[302.28] That May God take away
all my difficulties.
[313.60] Always keep our companionship intact
[322.96] and remove all the problems.
[350.24] Stay here today.
[352.28] Ramsha I cannot stay today.
[356.08] Alizey’s condition is not well.
[361.36] I cannot leave her alone
in this condition.
[367.72] If things were normal I would have
stayed but…
[372.16] But what?
[376.40] But I want Alizey to stay happy till
our child comes in this world.
[384.60] No problem Afnan,
[387.20] I guess it was in our fate
to meet like this.
[480.00] Madam Ramsha, 
you are my younger sister
[483.60] and seeing you in this condition makes me
 really sad.
[494.68] I wish I could do something for you.
[498.24] You have done a lot for me 
brother Jamshed.
[508.24] Thank you very much.
[510.72] I will be thankful to you all my life.
[513.60] Don’t say that madam Ramsha, 
you are embarrassing me.
[525.32] And can I say something to you?
[528.28] Mr. Afnan is really very lucky that 
he got a wife like you.
[542.60] Not everyone gets a wife who stands with 
you in every condition and compromises.
[556.32] May God keep you really happy.
[559.48] Amen. Thank you.
[565.28] Brother Jamshed, you just have 
to get me Afnan’s home on time.
[569.04] The time Rasheeda comes, then.
[571.12] Yes, sure. I will go now.
[659.96] Listen, girl.
[667.52] Why are you taking food 
into Afnan’s room?
[670.96] Where is Rasheeda?
[674.60] That…
[676.12] I am asking you something.
[678.44] She is serving food on the table…
[681.28] Okay, she is serving my lunch 
on the table.
[685.92] Tell me, did Alizay have breakfast?
[718.52] Afnan.
[720.52] Where were you? I have been 
waiting for so long.
[722.84] I was coming, you know, aunt stopped me
 on the way.
[727.32] Okay then? Is everything fine?
[728.88] Yes, everything is fine. Thank God. 
Nothing to worry about.
[731.80] I got biryani, you start eating.
[734.72] How can I eat? You will feed me.
[740.08] I feed you?
[741.44] Yes.
[747.12] I want that my wife feeds me food 
with her own hands.
[750.96] Feed me.
[752.04] Afnan, someone will see us.
[754.28] Who will see?
[762.32] There is no one at home.
[770.20] Alizay has gone to the office, 
she will come late.
[772.68] Aunt doesn’t come downstairs, 
so no one can see us.
[784.00] Come on, I am unwell.
[785.88] I am asking you to feed me, 
so feed me.
[789.56] Okay fine.
[834.92] Okay tell me, when are you 
coming back home?
[861.16] Hey, Alizay,
[862.92] you came early today from the office.
 Are you feeling okay?
[865.88] Mama, I was just a little unwell,
[867.92] so I thought I would come back
 early today.
[870.04] You did good. Go and rest a little.
[928.88] Alizay.
[1010.96] Hey, you are here. I mean.
[1014.68] How did you suddenly come?
[1017.44] Actually, I didn’t feel well 
in office today,
[1024.40] so I thought I would come early today.
[1032.80] Why? Did you not like it?
[1035.88] No. No.
[1041.28] Why would I not like it?
[1045.40] What is so surprising in this?
[1048.52] Actually, you don’t come so early 
from the office, that’s why.
[1055.36] By the way, you look more worried 
to me than surprised, why?
[1067.44] Is everything fine?
[1069.32] Yes. Yes. Everything is fine.
[1081.24] You are feeling it for no reason.
[1088.04] I am not worried at all.
[1089.88] I was just thinking that 
if you are not feeling well,
[1092.68] you should have visited the doctor 
on your way back.
[1096.32] No, I feel I need to rest.
[1104.68] I am very tired.
[1106.12] I will go change, then 
I will sleep for a while.
[1127.32] Did you give flowers to Ramsha?
[1129.08] Yes.
[1131.72] No, one minute Afnan,
[1133.28] I don’t understand.
[1135.92] Earlier, you couldn’t tolerate that girl.
[1139.08] You didn’t want to see her face.
[1143.28] Now suddenly you sympathize 
with her so much
[1145.88] that you are bringing her flowers.
[1150.96] Look Alizay,
[1153.00] now I don’t understand 
what your actual problem is.
[1158.44] Do you have a problem that
 I gave her flowers
[1160.76] or that I said thank you to her?
[1162.36] I didn’t like both the things, Afnan.
[1167.28] Even if that girl took care of uncle, 
she didn’t do us any favors.
[1189.12] Shameless girl.
[1191.80] Are you not ashamed?
[1194.28] How can you deceive us like this?
[1196.68] What did I do?
What happened to you?
[1199.24] You come and talk to me.
[1200.76] What has happened to me? 
Yes, yes,
[1202.92] you will come to save your lover.
[1205.60] What did you think?
[1206.96] You two will continue to fool me 
and I will tolerate it.
[1210.44] I will not find out anything?
[1212.20] Fahad told me everything honestly.
[1214.80] You found my husband in the entire world
to have an affair.
[1219.16] Alizay, what are you saying?
[1220.84] There is nothing like that. 
Please be quiet.
[1222.56] Don’t create a scene. 
I am not creating a scene,
[1224.60] you have created a scene out of me.
[1228.80] You have made a scene out of 
in front of the whole world.
[1238.08] One minute, Afnan. 
Yes?
[1241.48] What is this? 
What?
[1243.36] How did you get dirt on your coat?
[1247.04] Actually…
I will tell you.
[1249.80] Ramsha put this dirt, right? 
I saw it on her hands.
[1255.48] No, no, you are taking it wrong. 
You have a misunderstanding.
[1257.84] I am not taking anything wrong, Afnan.
[1260.16] I couldn’t even imagine 
you could call fall so low.
[1263.20] You people have crossed all limits.
[1265.36] What nonsense is this?
[1267.20] I am not talking nonsense.
I am speaking the truth.
[1270.48] You are spending time with 
that cheap girl leaving you wife.
[1273.48] Shut up.
[1275.84] Just, shut up.
[1310.64] I think I shouldn’t have come here, 
Afnan.
[1316.44] Yes, maybe you are right.
[1319.72] You worry coming here 
for no reason.
[1322.60] You shouldn’t take so much stress.
[1325.68] After all, I am fine now.
[1328.36] I will come to meet you daily.
[1355.44] What happened? What are you thinking?
[1360.08] I am thinking that if Alizay has 
seen me in this home, then?
[1363.68] She didn’t see you right?
[1366.72] So why are you worried on this 
without any reason?
[1370.80] Will you answer me.
[1373.76] What?
[1376.64] I want that you tell everyone 
about your marriage with me.
[1382.76] Afnan, just like everyone respects 
Alizay as your wife,
[1387.56] I too want that respect.
[1398.28] You are my wife, this is a truth,
[1401.12] it is a reality.
[1404.76] You too will get the same position 
and place that Alizay has.
[1409.32] Just give me some time.
[1413.28] And trust me in this time, 
have faith.
[1562.20] The relationship I had dreamed
 of with you at one time.
[1567.40] My God will fulfill in a few moments.
[1579.28] I couldn’t even imagine Afnan,
[1581.16] that you would become my destiny.
[1585.72] Hey, then why are you crying?
[1590.72] This is not the time to cry.
[1598.56] I am not crying.
[1600.96] These are tears of happiness.
[1608.52] I had a lot of important meetings, 
but I said no,
[1611.72] first I will go meet my Ramsha,
[1614.48] then we will decide something.
[1618.36] Hey, what are you doing? No.
[1619.84] What is wrong, Afnan?
[1621.20] I don’t like that you touch 
my shoes like this.
[1625.32] Really?
[1627.48] But I will really like 
if I do all your work.
[1632.08] You know Afnan,
[1634.92] I really wanted to do all your work.
[1639.28] After all,
[1640.56] I am your wife and you have 
the most right on me.
[1651.28] What are you looking like that?
[1655.40] I was thinking how much difference 
is there between you and Alizay.
[1662.60] I am disappointed at myself.
[1666.52] You got into so much difficulty and 
came to meet me here, and I…
[1673.00] I couldn’t even inform you about this.
[1677.12] I know you love me a lot. 
But I am absolutely fine.
[1680.84] I am absolutely fine. It is just a matter
 of a few days,
[1683.88] everything will be like earlier. 
That’s why you go from here.
[1687.72] No. No. No. I cannot leave you 
and go anywhere, Afnan.
[1690.72] I will stay with you. 
I will take care of you.
[1694.44] And after all, all this happened 
cause of me.
[1697.84] How did all this happen 
cause of me?
[1699.52] Look, I worried you so much, 
I gave you so much tension
[1703.24] and you had an accident cause of me.
[1705.36] I want to stay with you.
[1707.04] Ramsha, don’t blame yourself.
[1709.92] Nothing happened to me, 
I am absolutely fine.
[1713.48] In a few days everything will be 
like before.
[1728.24] Everything will be fine. 
Stop crying.
[1731.00] You know, I cannot tolerate you crying.
[1736.80] Did you make this soup yourself?
[1738.60] Yes.
[1739.76] It must be really bad.
[1742.60] You drink it and try. Should I feed you?
[1763.32] Not bad.
[1777.32] I want that my wife feeds me food 
with her own hands.
[1780.68] Feed me.
[1782.72] Afnan, someone will see us.
[1785.08] Who will see? 
There is no one at home.
[1788.36] Alizay has gone to the office, 
she will come late.
[1790.92] Aunt doesn’t come downstairs, 
so no one can see us.
[1793.92] Come on, I am unwell.
[1795.80] I am asking you to feed me, 
so feed me.
[1799.68] Okay fine.
[1819.44] Okay tell me, when are you
coming back home?
[1843.80] That’s it, enough driving.
[1846.56] Hey, does anyone drive like this?
[1848.56] I mean, you would have just gotten me
killed along with you.
[1852.04] You are laughing.
[1853.40] Why are you so scared?
Were you not scared?
[1858.48] When you are with me, 
then why should I be scared?
[1866.24] You know when you are with me,
I don’t fear anything.
[1876.20] I feel I am the safest in the world.
[1880.76] And when you are with me,
[1883.84] my life changes.
[1916.20] Hey, hey, what are you doing?
[1917.92] You trying to fix your scarf will get 
a cloth on my face, I will die.
[1922.80] Afnan, don’t say this again.
[1926.76] Okay, I won’t.
[1934.92] Shall we go?
Come on.
[1939.92] Ramsha.
[1941.56] Ramsha, I talk to you with love 
again and again
[1943.96] and you start driving the fast. 
Ramsha, please….
[1946.08] Fine. Okay. Okay. 
Okay, Afnan.
[1973.60] Okay listen to me.
[1974.76] Yes?
I have kept all the food here.
[1976.52] Yes. 
Serve it on the table.
[1978.28] And put the kebabs 
that I took out,
[1980.96] put them in a plate and 
place them on the table.
[1982.72] I am going to get ready
[1984.24] or else Afnan will say I am always 
dressed like a maid.
