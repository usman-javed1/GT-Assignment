Why is Ramsha pretending to be 
my mother, mom? What was the need for her to uncle that 
there are classes in the evening as well? Who gave her the right? Will she take my life decisions now? I guess she is doing all this so 
she can impress your uncle. Obviously, if she has to permanently stay 
in this house, she will have to do something. Mom, it doesn’t make any
difference to me whether she stays in this house 
or out of this house, she just shouldn’t interfere 
in my matters, tell her in your own words 
because if I will do, she will feel very bad. There is no need for you 
to say anything, I don’t want you to say a thing and she exaggerates it forward 
in front of uncle. Your impression will be ruined 
for no reason. I will talk to her myself Alizeh. That is why I haven’t said anything to her, but next time if she says anything like that, 
mom, I am not going to spare it. Do make her understand, I don’t like anyone interfering 
in my matters whether its uncle or Ramsha. Okay relax. I have to do something 
about this Ramsha. I don’t understand what is wrong with dad that he has kept that girl in this house. Uncle has asked mom to find her 
a good match, now let’s see. really? That’s great. Tell aunt to move things forward 
so that girl can get married soon. Mom doesn’t have a magic wand that she can bring a good proposal 
immediately. It takes some time, Afnan, and by the way, that girl doesn’t have
 any background, she has no family, it is difficult to find good proposals and the potential proposals look at 
what is her education, where has she come from,
what does she do? There is no information about her. Let’s see what happens. By the way, mom has even asked the servants 
of the house to let her know if there is a good proposal. And yes, Aunt Rasheeda recommended
a proposal, but uncle refused, I don’t know what uncle wants. Do one thing, ask aunt to let me know whenever there is 
a good proposal, I will convince dad myself. Okay. Bashir, ask the driver to get out the car,
I have to go out. The Driver has gone to pick
Madam Ramsha from the academy What is this daily drama? I have asked brother 
so many times that my car… Listen, this is not your dad’s car 
that you roam around in. The car belongs to you guys I just went to the academy. You don’t need to act that innocent. If brother has given you space to live
in this house out of courtesy, it doesn’t mean at all that you are a member of this family, and these cars, are for the members of this house 
not for every stranger. Uncle asked me to take the pick 
and drop to the academy with the driver this is why I went with the driver. Hey if brother has said it 
to you out of courtesy, that doesn’t mean you should say 
yes to everything he asks you to do. Have some shame and a person 
should also say no sometimes. You are not a kid that everything 
must be told to you. Be careful next time. Listen, this is not your dad’s car that 
you roam around in. The car belongs to you guys I just went to the academy. You don’t need to act that innocent. If brother has given you space to live
in this house out of courtesy, it doesn’t mean at all that you are a member of this family, and these cars, are for the members
of this house not for every stranger. No, I won't cry now, I will be patient, I have learned it in the class today the one who is patient. God increases their good deeds. And my sins are so much that I really need good deeds, I won’t do it anymore. Oh God, give me patience, I don’t know how to be patient. This is difficult for me, but nothing is impossible 
for you my Lord, give me patience. Greetings uncle. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Are you going to the academy 
by the grace of God? Yes. Brother Bashir, ask the driver to drop 
Madam Ramsha to the academy. No, no, I will manage myself, don’t get bothered because of me, 
I will manage myself, uncle. What is in it? How will you go yourself? Driver will
drop you in the car to the academy, what is there to worry about? I will go by the auto rickshaw uncle. I used to travel in the auto rickshaw 
with mom, so I am used to it. Ramsha, my child, when there is the facility
of car available at home what is the need to go in a rickshaw? Uncle, you are forcing me for no reason, I am telling you that I will manage, 
don’t worry. You have already done 
so many favors on me, I feel bad that you get worried for me
 over every little thing. Greetings, brother. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Ramsha has anyone said 
anything to you? No, no one said anything. I shall leave now. Sure, go. 
Bye. Brother I will make tea. no, no, I don’t need tea. Alizeh, Even Afnan is not going 
with me to the wedding, at least you come along, it is a family wedding, 
what will everyone say that I have come all alone? Mom, I cannot leave the city for so long. I had taken so many leaves 
for the wedding and now I won’t get leaves again. And my manager has even gone 
for the vacation, it is impossible for me, 
I am so sorry, Mom. Afnan, at least you come along with me. I am not going for a month, we will 
come back in a couple of days. Aunt, Alizeh is not even coming, 
what will I do there alone? I don’t even know anyone there anyway, yes, if Alizeh will go, 
I will happily go with her. Nice excuses both of you. If you are not coming with me at least 
help me with packing. Yes, definitely, do you want me to do it right now? 
Let’s go. Yes sure. Sir Afnan? Sir Afnan? Sir Afnan? What happened? What happened? Sir Afnan, come quickly, 
the elder Sir is unwell. What? Where is dad? In the room. I have given him the injection 
he will sleep for a while. And if he stays sleepy 
you don’t have to worry. Okay. 
Okay? Yes. Okay Mr. Afnan, I even told you earlier that you have to bring him to me for 
checkup definitely once in a month but you have been careless. What can I do doctor? 
Dad doesn’t listen to me. And then you know that our business, I don’t get much time but you are right I will be careful from now onwards. You know it very well that Mr. Qasim 
has diabetes and he is a heart patient and it is very important for him 
to get his checkup done. Now don’t repeat such carelessness. I am changing his medicine. Okay. 
Come with me. Okay. Alizeh? hmm? I actually wanted to say that how 
about you don’t go to the office today? I was just talking to the doctor, he was saying that dad needs 
very good care right now. Everything will get very easy 
if you can stay back. Afnan, I told you that my manager is even on leaves, 
I cannot take an off at this time. So that’s good, you call at your office and tell them that there is an emergency at home, if the manager can take 
an off then you can too. Afnan, by the way 
why are you so worried? The doctor was just telling you that uncle is better right now, 
let him rest. There is everyone else at home too,
servants are here too. Please don’t worry. It means that you will definitely 
go to the office? Afnan, try to understand me. Why are you acting stubborn like a kid? I am helpless. You are helpless. I should understand your problem, but you won’t. Umm, okay don’t be upset. Okay listen, call me if there is 
anything and I will come. I am getting very late, I will try to come early in the evening. Take care. Greetings dad. Greetings, may peace be upon you. How are you feeling now? Yes, I am fine, thank God, I just feel heavy at heart sometimes so then I feel difficulty in breathing,
other than that I am fine. okay, by the way, I was just speaking
to your doctor right now, he was complaining about you that 
you are not taking medicines in time. In fact, I feel that you are not taking 
medicine at all that is why you got unwell. Hey Afnan, doctor these days are not
even secret sharers anymore, I mean he spoke to you? Look I am fed up of taking 
these medicines, I cannot take them anymore, and whatever God wills 
will happen anyway, I cannot take the medicines. But this is not a solution dad, if you wouldn’t take medicines then… Sir, I have served the food, 
come everyone. Okay you may go. Okay listen, what have you made for dad? I didn’t make anything for dad. Why? Why didn’t you make something? Can’t you see dad is so unwell? You think he will eat normal food at home? Make diet food for him, go. Tabassum, there is no need to make that
tasteless non spicy soup. I will eat whatever is cooked 
at home, okay? There is a limit, dad. Okay. You have got so unwell by not being
careful with what you eat, doctor has given me such a long lecture. You won’t eat home cooked food,
you will have soup, that’s it. Uncle, listen to me, I will make a delicious soup for you. Whenever mom and dad used 
to get unwell, I used to make soup for them,
I make very good soup, if you want, I can make chicken 
corn soup for you or I can even make vegetable soup 
it will have everything carrots, capsicum, peas, corns etc, it will be very yummy, trust me, 
it won’t be saltless at all. Oh, that even sounds yummy, it will be great if you make it, 
I will have that, okay. okay I will bring it for you. Alizeh? 
hmm? I actually wanted to say that how 
about you don’t go to the office today? I was just talking to the doctor, he was saying that dad needs 
very good care right now. Everything will get very easy 
if you can stay back. Afnan, I told you that my manager
is even on leaves, I cannot take an off at this time. So that’s good, you call at your office and tell them that there is an emergency at home, if the manager can take an off 
then you can too. Afnan, by the way 
why are you so worried? The doctor was just telling you that uncle is better right now, 
let him rest. There is everyone else at home too, 
servants are here too. Please don’t worry. It means that you will definitely 
go to the office? Okay listen, call me if there is 
anything and I will come. I am getting very late, I will try to come early in the evening. Take care. Dad, by the way it’s so sad, I insisted so much but 
you didn’t listen to me and she said it for once 
and you agreed. This girl has been sitting with me 
by my side since morning. If God has blessed me with a daughter, she would be taking care of me like this, indeed, daughters are a blessing 
from God. Okay now you sit down,
why do you worry? I am fine. Yes, so I was telling her, let me tell you as well. Afnan, you know when after childhood 
and adolescence a person steps into old age, he doesn’t need anything, 
you must have seen that he just asks for some attention, 
he wants that people who live around him 
spend some time with him, he wants to see his kids around him,
kids of his kids, when God will bless you with a child, you will see I will be roaming around 
with them, I will make them sit on my shoulders,
I will play with them, a person gets a different energy 
when he becomes a grandfather, yeah. Uncle, soup. Give it to me, I will feed him. Let it be, I will have it myself. I will have it myself. Give it to me. But dad. In The name of God, 
the most gracious and merciful. Mmm, wow, you have made such tasty soup. My child, when I get unwell again, make the same soup for me. Uncle, God forbid, you get unwell again. And you don’t have to get unwell 
to have this soup, whenever you will ask me, 
I will make this soup for you. I have to get unwell to 
have such nice soup. Greetings uncle. Greetings, may peace be upon you. How are you now? I am fine, by the grace of God, 
how are you? Alizeh, my child, do one thing, 
learn the recipe of this soup from Ramsha, if she is not there some time, you make this soup for me. it is amazing. I will be right back. Afnan, at least you could have called me
and told me uncle is absolutely fine, I came so early from work, I could have finished my work, at least. Unbelievable, you still care about your work, you are concerned about your work? Why is your mood off? Uncle is absolutely fine, he is eating, drinking, he is happy. What else does he need? he needs our attention, the sad part is you are unable
to understand this. Why are you being worried like 
uncle has been unwell for ages? I am not as upset about dad’s health as much as I am hurt by your behavior. Please Afnan, stop talking nonsense, I was worried for him that is why
I came early. Yes, I can clearly see how much you were worried for him. Afnan, actually, there are some people, no matter what we do for them, they are never happy, 
you are one of them. Afnan? Don’t you have to sleep? You have been sitting here 
since morning, you must be tired, go and rest for a while. No, you go to sleep. Dad is not well, 
he has a temperature, I will sit here tonight. Uncle has fever? When did he have fever? What do you mean by when? What do you want? Do you want me to give you 
a report of every second here? That at xyz time dad had a temperature. That is not what I meant, Afnan, why are you being so cranky, I was just asking, you sat here all day, you must be tired, go and 
rest for a while. No, I am absolutely fine. Who will take care of uncle 
if you get unwell? Okay listen, you go and 
rest for a while, I will sit with uncle. Are you sure you will sit? Yes, it’s not a problem. Okay. Great because I have to meet 
Dr Peerzada, he is weird, I have been calling him for so long,
he is not attending, I will go check at the hospital. Yes, don’t worry, I am here. 
Okay. How is uncle? 
Did he wake up? He has fever, Afnan has gone to talk to the doctor. Umm, Ramsha, can you sit with uncle for a while? Actually, I am very tired, 
I just came back from the office and Afnan made me sit here
 and went. Please, will you sit here 
if there is no problem? Listen, whenever Afnan comes, tell him
that I just left from here. Do you understand
what I am saying? Hmm. Thank you so much. Sit. Afnan? Afnan? Afnan, 
quickly open the door. Quickly open Afnan. What happened? Uncle’s condition has gone really bad,
quickly come. What? Doctor? Doctor, what happened to dad? Doctor, why aren’t you telling anything? What happened to my dad? 
Tell me something, please.
