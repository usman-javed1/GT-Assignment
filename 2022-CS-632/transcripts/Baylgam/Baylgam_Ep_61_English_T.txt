[27.88] Anwer, tea.
[34.12] Did you talk to Ramsha?
[37.40] What could I talk about?
[39.60] Did you not see how 
badly she was crying?
[45.72] Her crying in this 
condition is not good.
[53.52] But your son doesn’t 
understand it.
[57.64] I don’t understand 
myself what to do.
[62.20] I don’t believe all this.
[68.72] Brother Qasim’s son is 
really sober and smart.
[73.96] I feel Shani is putting
 an allegation.
[79.00] Why?
[80.80] Why would Shani do this?
[83.16] How would I know?
[84.32] You ask Shani.
[89.28] He is putting an allegation on her.
[93.04] Shani cannot be that mad.
[96.36] He must have surely
 seen something,
[98.28] he must have heard something.
[102.40] I agree,
[104.12] that Shani is a little mad.
[108.32] But he is not that mad.
[112.44] You tell me yourself,
[113.72] what do you think?
[116.04] What is the need for
 madam Alizeh to lie?
[120.28] Huh?
[123.88] I don’t know Anwer,
[124.68] but my heart is not ready
 to accept this.
[133.52] I agree that Ramsha was wild,
[140.24] she used to make videos
 from her mobile,
[142.64] she would frankly talk to her friends,
[144.72] she was always on her phone,
[147.24] but that Afnan seems
 like a smart boy.
[156.96] And if I tell you the truth Anwer,
[159.88] I feel that,
[161.12] that Alizeh wants that Ramsha 
has no relation with that home.
[172.36] Whenever I go,
[173.72] brother Qasim meets nicely,
[176.52] but Alizeh and her mother,
[179.64] have a cold behaviour towards us.
[182.44] Fine, okay,
[184.44] whatever you say, I believe you.
[187.92] I believe it that Alizeh doesn’t like
 Ramsha staying in that home,
[192.48] then does that means,
[193.92] Alizeh would lie, 
but an allegation on her?
[202.16] No, no,
[204.24] that’s not how it is madam Salma. 
That’s not how it.
[208.60] No one blames anyone like this.
[212.16] There is surely some
 truth behind things.
[218.92] I don’t know.
[235.92] There is surely some truth behind it.
[240.96] No one blames anyone like this.
[260.16] Hey, dad, you are here.
[262.00] I even went to your room
[263.68] and ask, but…
[265.44] did Ramsha give you 
your medication?
[268.04] I took my medication.
[270.04] Ramsha is not there,
[271.68] she left at night.
[276.44] This means she left 
cause of Alizeh.
[280.00] Ramsha took the 
right decision that
[281.96] she left from here and
 she told me and went.
[289.84] She is not nonserious like you.
[292.56] She is a smart child.
[299.32] She understood the need
 of the situation
[301.92] and she did what 
was better for her.
[306.76] Ramsha is smart, dad.
[311.12] I wish your daughter-in-law
 was that smart too.
[319.16] Then I wouldn’t have had 
to see this day today.
[327.88] I too would have had 
peace in my life.
[350.04] Alizeh,
[353.04] Afnan was sleeping in the lounge.
[357.32] Please mama,
[358.44] now don’t say that he was sleeping
 in the lounge because of me.
[361.56] He was not sleeping 
there by his will,
[363.00] I didn’t say anything to him.
[366.12] Alizeh, I don’t understand
[368.68] how this relation will 
move forward,
[372.00] how will it be strong?
[374.40] You don’t agree to stepping back,
[376.20] nor is he ready to agree.
[378.80] Child to live in a relation,
[382.40] you have to show flexibility,
[384.08] not stubbornness.
[386.80] I am surprised mama,
[388.72] even after all that happened,
[390.16] you are thinking I am wrong.
[392.52] Have you forgotten what
 Afnan has done?
[395.64] No, child,
[398.00] I didn’t forget anything,
[399.76] I remember it all.
[401.24] Then how can you take his side?
[404.56] I am not taking his side,
[407.16] I am worried for you
[409.20] because you are my only daughter.
[412.00] I don’t want you to face any sorrow.
[415.84] I just want that you 
stay happy, child.
[423.60] I too want to stay happy, mama,
[428.12] but now I have no
 happiness with Afnan.
[431.68] I can never stay happy with him.
[435.20] Don’t say that Alizeh.
[437.24] How many times have
 I told you that
[439.44] you think several times 
before talking.
[441.96] I think?
[444.88] I have done all that I had to
 think about and understand.
[450.36] Now Afnan has to think 
and understand.
[454.84] Mama, he has hurt my heart,
[457.16] he has left my heart.
[459.60] No Alizeh,
[461.44] don’t say that.
[464.00] Afnan is your husband.
[467.08] Child, you should be thankful that
[469.76] you have your husband’s 
shade on you.
[477.76] Someone should ask me what
 a life without a husband is.
[486.24] Who knows it better than me?
[505.64] I am getting late. I am leaving.
[531.12] Is Afnan in the office?
[532.28] Yes, who are you?
[534.36] Excuse me.
[537.40] Fine, you email these documents.
[540.04] Stop. I am telling you…
[541.08] In this, all…
[542.72] Sorry sir, I tried hard to stop him, but
[545.56] he came inside forcefully.
[546.92] It is okay.
[548.32] Mr. Tariq, you please leave.
[552.16] You…
[554.24] Okay, sir.
[560.80] You did good that you sent 
your servants away.
[563.84] You know I wouldn’t even have
 liked myself had I insulted you
 in front of them.
[569.56] What nonsense is this?
[571.96] Is this the way to 
come to the office, to talk?
[575.08] Yes, you are right.
[577.08] Actually, I should break your 
face for what you have done.
[584.04] Look Shani,
[586.56] I don’t want to do anything
 like this, but
[588.40] you are forcing me that 
I call my guard..
[590.64] No, not just the guard,
[593.36] call all your other employees,
[596.08] call your secretary from outside.
[597.84] In fact, call everyone in this room,
[599.44] so that they know 
what you are up to,
[601.72] and what you are doing,
[603.20] and what your relation 
has been with my wife.
[612.00] You know who told me all this?
[614.92] Your wife.
[620.28] Now I want that 
I divorce Ramsha.
[625.28] No, no, Shani, 
what is wrong with you?
[628.12] You try and understand.
[629.96] Think with a cool mind.
[632.28] Ramsha and I have no relation,
[634.08] you have a big 
misunderstanding, man.
[638.96] After all, Ramsha is really sad,
[641.72] if you do something like this,
[642.88] then she won’t be able
 to take the shock.
[644.52] Don’t do anything like this,
 please.
[650.36] You are more worried 
about my wife, than me.
[658.20] Good.
[662.56] But you know what?
[665.84] You understand one thing today.
[670.80] I know well what I have to do 
with my wife and what not.
[684.00] But it would be better that 
you stay away from her.
[690.76] I am explaining this to 
you for the last time.
[765.16] Shani.
[771.20] I want to talk to you.
[775.16] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything, go from here.
[781.80] I don’t even want to see your face.
[785.48] Listen to me, once. Please.
[787.48] I don’t want to hear your nonsense.
[789.88] I told you to leave.
[791.76] Shani,
[793.20] let me clarify once.
[796.72] Give me one chance.
[800.20] Listen to me.
[801.68] Believe me,
[803.52] I have no place for
 Afnan in my heart,
[805.24] I have no love for him in my heart.
[811.12] Only you are in my heart.
[812.84] You are a liar, do you understand?
[815.28] You deceived me.
[818.08] I didn’t lie about anything,
[820.20] nor did I deceive you.
[822.36] You didn’t lie to me?
[825.60] Then where did Afnan come from?
[828.28] Did you not hide your past from me?
[831.48] Don’t lie, you are a liar.
[835.04] Whatever was between
 Afnan and I is in the past,
[839.44] that ended a long time 
before the marriage.
[847.64] There was nothing to tell you,
[849.36] so what would I have told you?
[851.24] Stop it, Ramsha.
[855.20] Love never ends and
[857.52] you used to love him.
[861.40] Believe me a little.
[865.00] Fine, if you don’t believe me,
[867.72] then at least believe 
what Afnan told you.
[870.72] You know uncle’s 
environment is not like that,
[873.88] he didn’t bring Afnan 
up in this manner.
[923.20] Afnan, where were you?
[924.44] What did you do?
[927.92] what did I do?
[930.28] Don’t lie to me,
[933.24] because Shani came 
to my office today.
[942.36] Alizeh, you have done 
something really cheap.
[949.16] You told Shani everything 
about Ramsha and I.
[957.16] Afnan, you had told me
[959.16] there is nothing between 
you and Ramsha
[962.00] that you want to hide.
[968.00] When everything is 
clear between you two,
[970.48] then what are you scared about?
[973.08] I cannot believe that
[974.76] I had loved a low life like you.
[984.88] I am disappointed with myself.
[1019.84] Afsheen, you don’t worry.
[1021.32] I think we should give
 those two sometime,
[1025.36] everything will be fine.
[1028.00] I pray to God brother,
[1029.52] that what you are saying happens.
[1031.96] I believe that if someone 
does no wrong to anyone,
[1034.76] nothing wrong happens with them.
[1044.04] It is time for test, it will pass.
[1048.20] Sir, madam Ramsha’s family is here.
[1050.92] Yes, yes, call them.
[1052.20] Okay.
[1058.36] Greetings.
[1060.28] Hey. Come. Come.
[1064.20] Greetings.
[1065.84] You people are here suddenly.
[1067.72] You should have told 
me earlier, informed me,
[1070.04] actually, I have a really
 important meeting.
[1073.36] Mr. Qasim, even we too want to 
ask you some important things.
[1089.52] You have a seat. Sit.
[1106.88] What did you do, Alizeh?
[1109.76] Shani’s family is sitting with
 brother downstairs.
[1112.84] You must have understood it.
[1116.04] You tell me what did you 
think doing this, answer me.
[1119.88] I mean, you told Shani
 about Afnan and Ramsha,
[1124.68] huh?
[1125.96] The fire will not be 
limited to Ramsha,
[1128.32] it will burn your relation with Afnan.
[1132.20] Idiot, you should have taken
 my advice before doing anything.
[1135.76] What will brother think about you?
[1139.16] What do you think?
[1140.24] Afnan will have love for 
you in his heart?
[1142.60] Not at all.
[1145.00] I am asking you something, 
answer me.
[1147.68] So what could I do?
[1149.44] I was angry with Ramsha,
[1150.64] I did what I thought was right.
[1155.16] Alizeh, I am tired of 
making you understand.
[1159.20] One problem doesn’t end
[1160.60] and you create another issue.
[1163.40] What will brother think
[1165.24] about my upbringing of you.
[1170.52] This is the limit.
[1182.64] Tabassum, what is going on here?
[1185.36] It is madam Ramsha’s birthday.
[1188.28] So who got this decoration done?
[1190.32] Mr. Afnan got it done.
[1196.16] Here, keep it inside.
[1198.00] Take this too.
[1203.28] Hey, you people are here.
[1205.04] Afnan, you got all this 
decoration done?
[1207.56] Yes, I had to do everything urgently.
[1209.84] It is Ramsha’s birthday
[1211.32] and dad had specially said that
[1212.80] the arrangement of her 
birthday should be done well.
[1215.08] Dad was saying that 
I invite all her family,
[1217.00] but I only invited Shani 
and Annie.
[1219.40] Yes, you did good. 
You did really good.
[1222.24] Aunt, you think yourself,
[1223.64] she serves dad so much.
[1225.76] I mean, she doesn’t 
sit for a second.
[1228.24] She also cares for 
all of a lot too.
[1229.44] She doesn’t leave 
anything in his care.
[1231.80] Now we can do this much
 for her happiness.
[1234.28] Come on, we will cut the cake.
[1236.20] They are all waiting.
[1239.56] Fix your mood, please.
[1269.40] What are you doing? 
What has happened?
[1270.68] I should give you a medal, right?
[1273.32] Shani, what has happened?
[1275.76] Shani. What is this?
[1277.28] what is going on?
[1278.72] what is this noise about?
[1279.56] What is this?
[1283.24] You are a cheater.
[1284.92] You cheated me, 
you cheated all of us.
[1307.92] Whatever was between 
Afnan and I is in the past,
[1312.24] that ended a long
 time before the marriage.
[1315.88] There was nothing to tell you,
[1317.52] so what would I have told you?
[1319.36] Stop it, Ramsha.
[1323.48] Love never ends and
[1325.80] you used to love him.
[1423.24] Afnan, listen to me.
[1424.76] Afnan, I am saying 
something to you.
[1426.04] What is wrong with you?
[1427.20] Why are you ignoring me?
[1428.24] Don’t be mad.
[1429.32] Look, listen to me carefully.
[1431.72] If you think that the world 
operates on your orders.
[1434.64] What you say will happen
[1436.00] and you will stop whoever 
you want, they will stop,
[1438.08] then that is not true.
[1442.44] I have been tolerating you
 for a long time,
[1444.28] but don’t consider
 it my weakness,
[1446.08] it is my helplessness.
[1448.08] Why don’t you 
speak the truth?
[1449.64] You cannot tolerate that
[1451.08] your lover’s husband 
is insulting her,
[1453.12] humiliating her, only
 because of your love.
[1455.40] Shut up.
[1457.48] Just shut up.
[1460.20] If you say another cheap thing,
[1464.36] then I will say something,
[1465.64] that our relation will end forever.
[1468.80] Understand?
[1469.68] Afnan, what are you saying?
[1473.56] I am absolutely right, aunt.
[1478.24] And instead of saying 
anything to me,
[1479.64] make your daughter understand.
[1481.84] If she bothers me like this,
[1485.56] then she won’t be part of my life.
[1508.52] Alizeh, what is all this?
[1538.04] Wow, man.
[1539.28] How are you?
[1540.72] You have changed completely
 in year or two.
[1542.64] A car and everything. Amazing.
[1546.16] This is great.
[1547.80] I am surprised to see you.
[1549.76] Hey, Shani, this is
 earning from abroad.
[1552.36] Look, I would say that instead 
of working hard here,
[1554.56] work hard abroad.
[1556.20] It is truly silver. Silver.
[1560.60] You look at me,
[1562.44] how long was
 I gone to Dubai for?
[1564.36] Just two years.
[1565.64] I got a home and this
 great car in that time.
[1569.68] That’s what I am seeing,
[1570.72] you did everything so soon.
[1572.52] I would say you too come to Dubai,
[1574.80] my cousin has a superstore in Dubai.
[1577.44] Yes, it will cost a small sum,
[1578.76] but you will earn millions.
[1583.60] You have a good plan, 
but how will I go?
[1587.04] I don’t have money.
[1588.72] The shop’s condition 
is in front of you,
[1590.08] you know about it.
[1592.72] How will I spend so much?
[1594.36] Take a loan from someone.
[1599.00] Who will give me a loan?
[1601.12] My family is full of poor people.
[1604.16] You must have someone.
[1605.68] Relative, friend, cousin.
[1608.28] Do you have no one?
[1609.36] Hey, in-laws, your in-laws?
[1617.44] What are you thinking about?
[1619.80] Listen, what will you eat?
[1621.40] Hey, I won’t eat here, come,
[1623.40] I will feed you food at a five 
star restaurant. Come on.
[1626.24] Come on, come.
[1627.08] Come.
[1628.16] How long will we sit at 
the roadside café for?
[1630.88] Listen.
[1631.56] Yes?
[1632.80] Can I drive?
[1668.12] Yes?
[1668.84] Sir, he wants to talk to you.
[1673.88] Yes, greetings.
[1675.08] Greetings. Who is this?
[1677.24] Hey, you forgot me so soon.
[1683.56] You know, I am surprised
[1685.48] I had thought that the 
relation we have formed,
[1688.64] after that you won’t 
forget me so soon.
[1696.80] Anyway, this is Shani.
[1702.04] What do they say? 
Your enemy.
[1708.44] What are you doing here?
[1710.44] Look, if I talk about all this here,
[1713.52] it won’t look nice.
[1715.88] Even your staff is here,
[1719.32] I don’t think you will like it.
[1722.04] Because I feel that these secrets
[1724.64] should be discussed face to face.
[1726.72] What do you think?
[1729.64] Fine, let me talk to him.
[1736.84] Let him come inside.
[1738.28] Yes, okay sir. You can go.
[1769.24] Why did you come here?
[1771.36] Look, listen to me carefully,
[1772.96] I have no contact with Ramsha.
[1776.60] That is why there is some reason
 for which you came here.
[1778.68] Tell me what do you want?
[1781.28] You have no contact?
[1783.08] But you have a relation, right?
[1791.28] But I don’t understand
 this relation, because
[1795.28] you had a relation. Right?
[1805.96] And this is still fixed in 
my heart and mind.
[1808.44] I cannot forget this.
[1811.08] This means you need 
mental treatment.
[1815.36] Yes, I have a need,
[1817.56] but right now 
I need something else.
[1820.36] And you are a really smart man.
[1822.52] Because keeping 
a girl like Ramsha
[1825.84] in control is something 
a smart person can do.
[1832.80] The thing is that
[1836.04] I need five million rupees.
[1840.48] What?
[1845.36] Five million?
[1847.44] What will you do with such 
a big sum of money?
[1850.60] Now see when you met 
Ramsha at our home that day,
[1861.40] I realized that you really
 worry for her right now.
[1869.92] And you are aware of her 
condition too.
[1874.44] Now if something bad happens
 when traveling on a bike,
[1879.76] it won’t be nice.
[1882.20] So that’s why I am thinking 
I will get a car for her.
[1890.24] What do you think?
[1891.04] And you know that
[1893.20] things have become so expensive
 that this is how much a car costs.
[1898.48] I don’t have this much money.
[1904.40] Mr. Afnan,
[1906.28] say things that one understands.
[1908.84] I don’t understand that 
you don’t have money?
[1914.88] I understand everything 
you are saying, Shani?
[1921.20] I think you don’t understand me.
[1924.28] I cannot give you this much money,
[1926.16] so it better that you leave from here.
[1934.96] Yes?
[1939.04] Fine.
[1944.08] Hey. Err….
[1969.28] Alizeh,
[1971.32] I had told you not to do all this.
[1974.92] Today, Afnan spoke to me
 like this for the first time.
[1978.64] If you were smart,
[1980.80] then Afnan would never
 have said this to me.
[1984.80] What does Afnan
 think of himself?
[1986.72] What does he think,
[1988.36] if he leaves me then 
I will be ruined?
[1991.00] This will not happen at all.
[1992.44] He is mistaken.
[1993.84] I can do everything myself.
[1996.16] What can you do?
[1997.60] And what will you do?
 I too should find out.
[2000.16] Only because you earn,
[2001.40] does that mean that you
 will do everything?
[2003.44] Alizeh,
[2004.52] if brother and Afnan 
leave our life,
[2008.04] then we will have
 nothing in our life.
[2012.28] Needs a fulfilled with a job,
[2014.36] not wishes.
[2015.60] And the life you have
 gotten used to,
[2018.16] these luxuries,
[2019.48] you will never get them from a job,
[2021.80] you are mistaken.
[2024.28] Okay, please mama,
[2026.08] I know all this. I am not a child.
[2029.36] You are right.
[2030.72] You understand it all,
[2032.72] but you never learned to 
compromise in your life.
[2036.44] Because brother didn’t 
let you lack anything.
[2041.04] What would you know
[2042.44] what killing your wishes is like?
[2045.80] You agree to this,
[2047.64] that you too are used
 to these luxuries.
[2050.96] So, it would be better that
[2052.68] neither do you put 
yourself in this test,
[2054.96] nor do you put me in the test.
[2083.04] Shani, you come 
early from the shop.
[2086.72] We have to take Ramsha to
 the hospital for a checkup.
[2090.64] I cannot take her, 
you take her along.
[2092.84] Why?
[2094.08] Why should I take her?
[2095.16] She is your wife,
 she is your responsibility.
[2096.68] You take her.
[2097.32] She didn’t go to the hospital
 last month for a check-up.
[2101.84] Mama, I have to go do something
 important after the shop,
[2105.72] I cannot come early.
[2107.56] Is anything more important to 
you than your wife and child?
[2113.24] Her checkup didn’t 
get done last month.
[2115.20] It is really necessary for her 
to get a checkup this month.
[2117.56] Come early, understand?
[2123.68] Everyone can force 
themselves on me only.
[2127.72] They have made it a joke.
[2135.36] Ramsha, come on.
[2140.04] I am coming, just wait a minute.
[2143.00] We are not going to a wedding,
[2145.08] we have to go to the hospital,
[2146.92] come on.
[2148.68] Come on.
[2149.52] I am so sorry.
[2150.60] You think it is a joke,
[2151.28] you have made me
 your servant.
[2152.24] I couldn’t find my bag.
[2153.80] Come on.
[2159.48] Sit. Sit.
[2164.44] Hey. Hey, Ramsha. Ramsha.
[2169.72] Mama. Ramsha.
[2173.32] Ramsha…
[2174.80] Mama. Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama.
[2184.88] I don’t understand how she fell.
[2188.92] You didn’t even go 
a little far from home
[2191.76] and you made her fall.
[2194.56] What do you mean?
[2199.52] You think that I made 
Ramsha fall on purpose?
[2203.72] Shani,
[2204.60] the way you take out your 
anger on her nowadays,
[2207.28] we can expect anything from you.
[2210.84] You know, this is the limit.
[2216.64] Meaning, I will make her fall even 
after knowing her condition
[2225.56] and what will I get out of it?
[2227.28] How would I know what you will get?
[2231.84] But you should have seen
[2233.56] if she had sat on the bike or not?
[2243.04] She didn’t sit, and you started 
the bike and made her fall.
