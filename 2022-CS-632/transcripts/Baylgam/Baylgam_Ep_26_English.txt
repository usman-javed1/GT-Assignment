It’s good that I found you here Shani. Listen, I am very tired, you will go to the hospital and 
stay with brother today, I want to take some rest. Dad, I, in the hospital 
I feel suffocated there. And how will I sleep? Wow, amazing! Who is sending you to sleep there? You fool, the attendant has to stay awake
 for the patient at the hospital, you must stay awake too and 
take care of brother, have some fear of God, 
I am your father. He cannot sleep at the hospital. Okay, I will go, I will go. Yes, son, Shani, your father is right if he keeps on running
back and forth to the hospital, he will get unwell too. Okay I will go. Uncle, these are the jewellery 
of Mom and I, you must sell them and 
get dad’s surgery done. Thank God, you got some sense, some sense of realization 
towards your dad, I will sell them and see how much money
 I can get from them, obviously, who will pay the rest of the amount, I will have to pitch in, after all he is my brother, 
I cannot let my brother die. What you did is good, stay blessed. Just pray that May God give good health to brother. Amen. Anwar, when brother Noman said that he will 
get you the discount on the surgery then you should have told that to Ramsha, because the cost of the surgery could also 
have been arranged from the shop. Quiet! Quiet! Don’t you dare say a word more, what and I doing and how am I doing it, 
I know that very well. This is my and my brother’s personal matter, you don’t have to interfere in between, 
do you understand? Their pet! Just do one thing, one second. I have taken a picture of it, now keep them in the locker, good girl. Show it to me mom. Wow, uncle has saved a lot of money. Brother Sajid is not like your father, he is very intelligent, he has saved all his life and that is 
what is helping him today. Your dad didn’t save a penny till date and even if I tried saving something, he would come up with some excuse 
and get it out of me and spend it. Fahad, you are such a big character, 
you don’t know yourself. How do you do it? Brother, your friend does 
what no one can. By the way, I forgot telling you
something. Tell me. That girl, that friend of yours? Who? The one who make amazing videos? One of her reels also got viral
 a few days ago. That shopping girl Ramsha. Yes. My cousin Nabeel almost got married to her. What do you mean by almost got married. just think that they didn’t get married. Why? I saw that girl on the wedding day, in fact 
right at the time of marriage ceremony, I saw her and immediately recognized her, I told her entire history to my aunt 
and my cousin, in fact, I showed all her videos to them. Actually, my paternal family is very 
well behaved and traditional, they are far away from all this 
social media etc, the poor people didn’t know. 
One second. Yes, hello? What? Speak louder I cannot hear. 
One sec I will take this call. Actually, the thing is that the pain that my entire family 
is going through, no one has a solution to it. At least share the problem. Umm, what should I say? The time has passed... How can you even think 
that I will marry you? Actually, it’s my fault, I shouldn’t have been friends 
with you at all, I thought she is an innocent girl 
who keeps on getting herself in trouble so let me help her but you have been 
after me instead and why would I marry you? Who are you? What do you have? You left your studies. I have no idea about your 
family background, and you, you upload your videos 
on the social media so you can get famous, 
and I should marry you? Ramsha? Yes, dad? Go home, my child you must be tired. I am absolutely fine. And all my tiredness goes away 
when I look at you. You know what? I don’t feel like staying in home 
without you, the house feels very empty. Why are you looking at me like this? Do you need something? I am looking at how beautiful 
daughters are. You bring food for me daily 
in the morning, you take care of me all day 
without a frown, you are the same one who would get 
irritated if I asked you to do anything? But now you look very intelligent. That wasn’t irritation, dad, it was me being pampered 
and spoiled, I used to feel that no matter what I say
or whatever I refuse to do, my dad will never get upset with me. Forgive me. I know that I have made a huge mistake, please forgive me. No, no, that wasn’t irritation, I used to feel that was your childishness but now you have become all grown up
 and mature, those people, they didn’t value you at all, 
my child, he left my lovely daughter. Congratulations, 
the deal has been locked. Now at least get me coffee. Bro? So, what were you telling about 
Ramsha’s wedding? Yes, the story was left incomplete, then what else, who would just see everything 
and still go for it? When I told aunt, aunt humiliated them so much, we came back with the groom. I didn’t expect you to do something 
so pathetic Fahad. I couldn’t even have thought you would 
do something so disgusting, what was the need for you 
to do all that? What is wrong with you? 
Why are you feeling so bad? You got someone’s marriage broken, you ruined someone’s happy life and 
you are asking me why do I feel bad? Just imagine, Fahad, just imagine, had it been your own sister 
instead of Ramsha and some man would have done 
such a pathetic thing to her then what would you do? Listen, mind your tongue, the daughters and daughter-in-law 
of our homes doesn’t roam around doing 
such cheap things. Hey, what cheap things? 
What has she done? If there is something like that 
then you go and marry her. We should bring such daughter-in-law 
in our house? That girl, that friend of yours, Ramsha, my cousin Nabeel almost 
got married to her. I saw that girl on the wedding day, in fact 
right at the time of marriage ceremony, I saw her and immediately recognized her, I told her entire history to my aunt 
and my cousin. You got someone’s marriage broken, you ruined someone’s happy life and 
you are asking me why do I feel bad? Just imagine, Fahad, 
just imagine, had it been your own sister 
instead of Ramsha and some man would have done 
such a pathetic thing to her then what would you do? Listen, mind your tongue, the daughters and daughter-in-law 
of our homes doesn’t roam around doing 
such cheap things. Hey, what cheap things? 
What has she done? If there is something like that 
then you go and marry her. You have no idea about the value 
of relationships, Ramsha, you just care about your own self 
and your happiness and I, you… And yes, one last thing, just thank God that it was me, and I have been raised very well, if it would have been some other guy, he would have ruined your honor by now. I and you can never get married. Greetings, may peace be upon you. 
Hey sit, sit, sit. Greetings. What happened?
You look worried. No dad. Okay, is everything well? Yes dad, absolutely well. By the way you can share with me 
if you want, we are not just father and a son, 
we are good friends too. Of course, dad I know but there is nothing like that 
so what should I tell you. Afnan, I will agree to whatever you say but your face tells something else. Anyway, if you don’t want to share then as you wish,
 that’s not a problem. Umm, dad? Dad, may I ask you something? Yes. ask? There is just a metaphorical situation,
it is not for real but if you do something well with someone and that too purely out of sympathy, just out of sympathy, but the other person takes it 
in the wrong manner, takes a wrong meaning out of it umm, just say that the good you did, comes back at you negatively so then what will you do 
in such situation? The good you do can never come back 
in a negative way. If the good is just done 
for the sake of God, it always helps you,
 in this world and hereafter, you know these creatures, 
the human beings, they forget the favors but God never let a good deed
 go to waste. A man should do what do you call that, do a good deed and then forget about it. Afnan, if you keep every person and 
the relationship in its right place like our religion and 
the laws of our religions orders us, you will never have to face any difficulty, then you will never have any burden 
on your heart after doing any good deed, you won’t feel heavy. Rest assured. Hmm? Thanks dad, you have solved this complication too 
like always. Will you have coffee? Hey, you shared your feelings with me, 
now I will have coffee too. Done, I will just get it. Annie? Annie? Where are you coming back from 
at this time? From the hospital. Don’t lie, tell me honestly where are you
coming from? No matter where I am coming from you,
it’s none of your concern. We have told you so many times 
not to go out of the house alone. Don’t try to act like my father, my father is still there with me 
by the grace of God. Mind your own business. Tell me honestly, 
where were you? Who were you with? 
That boy was with you, right? Brother, she is right, she went with dad, dad stayed there at the hospital 
so she came back on her own. Why do you interfere? Why do you give clarifications? She was telling the truth, I saw her leaving with dad myself. You saw her leaving with dad, you didn’t see who was she 
coming back with. God knows what she does using 
hospital as an excuse, what do we know where 
she must be hanging out. She will never change. You won’t either. What did you say? Nothing, shall I get you tea? Yes, I will have tea. I don’t know why I get headache 
when I talk to this girl. I think she gets black magic done. Anyway, go make tea. Brother? Brother? Brother? Doctor? Doctor? Doctor? See what happened to my brother. You must wait outside. 
What? Yes. Hello? Oh God, what are you saying? Oh God, Indeed, to God we belong and 
to God we shall return. What happened mom? Annie? Your uncle, your uncle is no more. What? Yes. Mom? what are you saying mom? Uncle? Your uncle. What happened, Annie? Stop crying, dad will get well, 
if God wills. Annie, I am telling you dad will be fine, 
then, then why are you crying? Stop crying. Annie? Annie, why are you crying? 
What happened? Tell me? Tell me, what happened? 
Why aren’t you saying anything? Uncle’s no more. Are you mad?
What are you saying Annie? Don’t lie Annie, that’s not possible. Where is dad? Dad? Mom? 
Ramsha? Afnan?
Hmm? Are you busy?  
No, no, come, sit. Actually, I was going to the mall so I thought I should as you as well, 
you come along too I need to take the car to the mechanic 
as well on the way back, it will get a little easy for me. How many times have I asked you 
to change your car now, umm I am busy I can’t come right now, 
do one thing, take my car. You know that my car is my lucky car, you know wherever I go in that car, 
my work always gets done. And you know what dad says? Hmm? Dad says that whatever is written 
in your fate, you just get that. Like you are in my fate? Okay now I understand, you have come here and sat on my head
so you won’t let me work now, so let’s do one thing, let’s take 
your car to the mechanic. Let’s go, I will get my bag. Hmm. And yes, I forgot telling something. What? You are the best. I will be right back. Sister-in-law? Sister-in-law? Say something, sister-in-law? For God’s sake, say something, brother Sajid left the world 
at least you don’t do that, sister-in-law say something, 
for God’s sake, at least cry, cry but don’t do that. 
Sister-in-law? Mom? Mom? Ramsha, Ramsha, ask mom to say something, since she heard the news of 
your dad passing away, she has gone completely silent, 
look she is shocked, she is not saying anything, 
she is completely quiet, make her cry, make her to speak, force her to talk else 
she will get really unwell, do something tell her 
she has become a widow. No, don’t say like this mom, mom look what is aunt saying, she is saying dad has left us, mom tell her that there is nothing like that, there is nothing like that, 
dad cannot leave us. Mom, please tell aunt, mom, please, mom, nothing like 
that has happened, right? Dad hasn’t left us right, mom? Mom, please tell aunt,

and made her lie down, she must rest for a while. Its good, she will rest for a while, Mehnaz’s BP already gets very high. Yes. that… Dad? Dad? Uncle, dad … You shameless girl, because of you, because of you, my brother who was like a 
father to me, left me, because of you, you are the murderer of my brother
