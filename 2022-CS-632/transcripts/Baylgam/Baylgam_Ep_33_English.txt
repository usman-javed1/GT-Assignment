What happened, mom? You look worried? Yes, sister-in-law’s phone
is constantly off, and Ramsha’s phone
isn’t going through as well. I asked sister-in-law to call
me as soon as she reaches there but there is no call from them. What do you know, they might have changed
their numbers because of Dad. Probably, but they should have called once
using anyone’s phone. Aunt must have not
called to be careful because whatever dad did, after that she would never want him to find out anything about Ramsha or to avoid any more trouble. Yes, I guess that is the reason. Don’t worry mom, wherever Ramsha and aunt must be they will be fine. I hope that is how it is. I have shared a lot of happiness and
sorrow with sister-in-law, without her and Ramsha this house is actually feeling very empty. True, there is so much emptiness
in the house without them. What are you doing here? Do you have any work? Where is the doctor? The doctor is in the OT, you must go to your
room right now, please. My child, how is she now? Stop, there is no need to show sympathy, it is because of you that my mother
is in this condition today, just because of you, what do you think? You will not be forgiven, ever. My child, I was… I told you I don’t need
sympathy from you. Just because of you today
my only support system, my mother is lying here
in this condition. I will never forgive you. Go away from here, go. So, you finally thought of me? Yes, I did, but you never thought of me, by the way, you are very
stubborn, Alizeh. And what are you? Selfish. You left without even telling me. You saw me leaving, you could have asked
me if you wanted to but no, you are you. Why should I ask you when you didn’t tell me yourself
then why would I ask you? Have you ever left without
telling me ever before that you went to Islamabad now? Even you never fought
with me like this before. Don’t say wrong things, Afnan, I didn’t fight with you, do you remember your words? I didn’t fight with you at all, I just asked you a question. You didn’t just ask a question, you put an allegation on me. I didn’t expect this from you Afnan. okay now forget all this, else we will have a fight again. Okay tell me, it has been so many days,
you didn’t miss me? I didn’t miss you at all. See, that’s what you do to me. Now what can I do if I don’t miss you? Should I forcefully miss you? You shouldn’t have behaved
like this with Mr. Qasim. Today, I and my mother are lying
here in this hospital because of him, he is my culprit, whatever I did is right. Madam, we see all this here daily, there is some sort of accident daily, injured and sometimes dead
bodies are also brought here but the one who commits the
accident always runs away, this is the first time in my
career that I have seen this, Mr Qasim hasn’t just accepted
his responsibility, in fact he made sure there
is no slacking in your or your mother’s treatment. No one even takes such
care of their own people the way Mr. Qasim has taken
care of you and your mother and even after so
much happened you didn’t even care
about his age or status, do you even know who he is? He is a renowned
businessman of this city, he can even get you arrested for
this misbehavior, you should be thankful that he
a kindhearted and a noble man, he didn’t just spend his money on
you but even gave you his precious time, who does that nowadays? Anyway, now you are better than before, you may go home, and my apologies if you felt bad
about anything I said. You are better… Greetings, may peace be upon you. Greetings. Sir, doctor
has discharged her. okay, I have… yes..  thank you. I have spoken to the doctor, my child, he is discharging you, so please give your house
address or any contact number. Or if you want to call your relatives,
you can call them here. You tell me where did you want to go, I can drop you there. Actually, I even wanted to
apologize to your family, I will take full responsibility
of your mother’s treatment, I will talk to the doctor. I have misbehaved so
much with you, right? No, my child, you don’t
have to say anything, I am responsible for
your mother’s condition. You give me your address, I will drop you there. Where do you live?
Where do you reside? Umm, actually, umm, I don’t have anyone in this
world except my mother. I mean any relative or acquaintance,
uncle or aunt etc? Anyone? No one. After my father’s death, mom is my only support. We used to live in a rented house and they asked us to leave there that is why Mom was taking me
somewhere far away. So where was your
mother taking you? You give me their address, I will drop you there. I don’t know, I don’t know whose house
mom was taking me to. Greetings brother. Greetings, may peace be upon you. Come, my child, there is no need to hesitate,
feel at home. Greetings. Greetings. Tabassum? Tabassum? Yes, sir? Take madam to the guest room. Her stuff? Yes, this is it for now, keep her bag take the rest when it is here,
take her for now. Come. Go, my child, go. Brother, who is this girl? This girl and her mother
met an accident by my car. Yes, that’s okay but, she is here? I mean why did you
bring her here, brother? Mom? Mom? Mom, save me, mom, save mom, mom, stop. Mom? Mom? Mom, my mom. Mom, please get well soon, mom, I don’t know where I am, I really need you. Mom, please get well, please take care of me, mom, I need you. Mom. Mom, come, mom. Mom. Listen, girl? Yes? Put my phone on charge. yes? Didn’t you understand? Put my phone on charge,
and the battery died. Where is the charger? How would I know? Check it must be somewhere. Okay. Listen, yes put this on charge and make a glass of
juice for me, okay? What happened, my child? Greetings, Greetings, may peace be upon you. You have had a misunderstanding Alizeh, she is our guest, she is a guest. She is a guest? yes. umm, sorry uncle, I thought we hired some new maid. Sorry. Is there any problem, my child?
Do you need something? No, I mean, I was out of water in my room,
so I came to get it. You go to your room,
go I will send it. Thank you. uncle, who is this guest? I will tell you. Uncle was getting angry
at me for no reason. Now that girl looked like a maid
by her appearance so I said it, how would I know he will bring
someone from the hospital? By the way, yes, I was thinking the same that if any girl would come up and say I have no one except my mother so how can you believe her? Anyway, I have instructed the servants
of the house as well and I am telling you too. Hmm? Just keep your eyes open and take care of your belongings. What do you mean? Look, brother has brought that girl
due to fear of God and sympathy but these are the innocent faces that
rob the entire house, they are not alone, they have an entire gang involved. What is wrong with you mom, don’t scare me. I am not scaring you, I am telling you what is right. But mom she looked innocent by face and now what will the poor girl do? Her mother is in coma. I don’t know why do I feel that I have met this girl somewhere or I have seen her somewhere, I can’t recall. Oh, please mom, don’t discover any relationship
with her now. Oh God! Give that sister good
health and complete recovery, oh Lord, ease her difficulties, oh Lord, the doctors, doctors are trying their
best to make her well, give her speedy recovery my Lord. Oh lord! Give cure in their hands, oh Lord her daughter is so worried, her daughter Ramsha is so worried.
Oh lord. My Lord, the responsibility
I have taken, I make you my witness and say that, the way I take care of
Alizeh like my daughter, Oh Lord, I am similarly, I am similarly able to take care of Ramsha as well, oh Lord, I have two sister and two
daughters from now onwards, oh God! grant her good health, grant her good health, may Ramsha’s mother
always stay with her. Oh Lord! Make everything well,
give health to all the patients, oh Lord! Just give health
to all those who are ill. *Arabic* Greetings. Greetings, may peace be upon you. How is your job, my child? Uncle, it’s going great. Thank God. Tabassum, call what is her name? Ramsha, call her from the
guest room for food. Brother, what is the
need to call her here? We can send the food
in the guest room there. It won’t look nice like this that she eats alone there, she should eat here with
the family here with us, and she is already very
disturbed because of her mother. Greetings. Greetings, may peace be upon you.
Have a seat, What will you eat? There is Biryani, curry, fried Rice, kebobs,
whatever you like. Feel like home, no formalities, eat, good girl. Why did Alizeh leave? She didn’t eat properly. Brother, I guess she has
a lot of office work, there is some project that
she needs to complete. Okay, have it my child, have the kebobs. Thank you. brother, have you sent
the driver somewhere? Umm yes, he has gone to the hospital with
Ramsha, he will come back in a while. Brother, don’t you think that this girl that you brought home, you have taken a useless
responsibility on yourself. I mean, brother
it would have been better had you sent her to the girl’s hostel, there are so many hostels in the city. Yes, there are a lot
of hostels in this city but I don’t trust the managements
of those hostels. Do you remember Afsheen, when you came to this house
after you got widowed, at that time you wanted
to admit Alizeh to a hostel as well but even at that time,
I was not convinced, you remember right? Look I don’t think that there is any other place appropriate
for daughters when there is a home, no matter if it is a hostel. Brother, there is a lot of difference
between Alizeh and that girl. Alizeh is my daughter and we know nothing about that girl that which family does she belongs too, what is her background and her nature. I am surprised Afsheen, you being a mother of a
daughter you are saying this? No matter whose daughter is it, we have to take care
of her the same way, daughters are our own, we are supposed to share their sorrows. Brother I was just. In the name of God, greetings. Mom? Mom? Where are you taking my mom? Where are you taking my mom? Stop, mom? Mom? don’t go mom, mom? Mom, don’t leave me, 
don’t take my mom. Mom? Mom! They were taking mom somewhere. Uncle? Uncle? yes, yes, Mr. Noman, 
I even prayed for you and that construction work of
 your plot will start too. Mom? Mom? Wait a minute,
 I will call you back. Where is my mom?
 Where is my mom? What? What? What happened,
 my child? What happened? Go and stop them, 
ask them not to take mom, if something happens to my mom. What is going on here? 
Who is yelling? I will die if something 
happens to my mom, I won’t be able to tolerate
 if mom goes away, tell them not to take my mom. No, my child, who is taking her away? No one is taking your mom away. They are a lot of people, they are taking my mom away, I even stopped them, they are not stopping, they are saying no.. My child, your mom is at the hospital, I have just come back from the hospital, you must have had some nightmare, Afsheen, go get water. Come, come, sit, my child. Uncle, you know 
I was stopping my mom, I felt something has
 happened to my mom, I won’t be able to live
 if something happens to my mom. Bring my mom in front of me, I just want to see her for once, I want to see if she is okay or not. Yes, you have water first. Have water. I don’t want to drink water. Have a little water, my child. I won’t have water, you just take me to the
 hospital once to show me my mother, I will be fine when I see her. I will take you to the
 hospital to your mom in the morning. No, no, I want to go right now, I want to see mom right now. You must sleep now. I feel so scared in the room, I cannot sleep right now. I want to see my mother please. I will ask Tabassum to sleep with her, you come upstairs. Okay. Listen, let’s do one thing, before sleeping, recite 4 prayers and 
blow it in the air, you won’t even be scared 
and you will be at peace. My mom will be fine? If God wills. If God wills. I will drop you to your room.
 Come, come. My mom. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen to her,
 my love, come, come. What are you doing? I asked you to clean my room, what have you gotten busy with? Madam, sir asked me to
 clean this room for Madam Ramsha, she will live in this 
room from now onwards. What? She will leave the guest 
house and live with us now? What is wrong with brother? I am just doing what sir 
has asked me to do. Where is brother? I will talk to him myself. He has gone to the hospital 
with madam Ramsha. Okay fine, you may go. Oh God! Brother has been visiting hospital like our own family member is not well. Ramsha, do you know, May God grant her 
a house in heaven, my mother’s name
 was Mehnaz as well. What? Your mother’s name 
was Mehnaz too? Yes, she was a very pious, kind-hearted and a very mature woman. I don’t understand what 
is uncle doing, after all? He has brought a strange girl home and now he is reacting 
as if she is our relative. How can we trust an
 unknown girl like this? You are right Alizeh, let me talk to dad. No Afnan, please you
 don’t say anything else he will feel that I and mom have complained 
about him to you. No there will be nothing like that, don’t worry, I will talk to him my way. I am telling you that you don’t need to
 say anything to him, he will take it wrong. okay fine, Alizeh, don’t worry. Umm, my meeting is about to start, I will talk to you later. Okay, just relax bye. Okay fine, take care. Dad is…
