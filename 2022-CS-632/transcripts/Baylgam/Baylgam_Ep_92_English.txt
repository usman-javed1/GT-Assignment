Alizay, please go and
have your medicine. Mama, I don’t want to eat
the medicine. Can I say something? Not just me, but even Afnan is getting
tired of this stubbornness of yours. You should thank God that God gave you such
a loving husband. Yes, I have such a loving husband that you called him two hours back. He didn’t even bother to come
and ask me. Okay are you not my love, go and have your medicine. Alizay, now you have to take care
of your future child along with yourself. Did you not hear
what the doctor said? He said you really need
to care for your health. Mama, you and Afnan, both of you only blackmail me
emotionally. What have I done? Hello. What? What happened, Alizay? Mama, that… What is the matter? Speak up. Mama, Afnan. Afnan. What happened to Afnan? You didn’t even call me once, Afnan, you are doing me very good. I married you and kept you here. I have deprived you of all your rights, I even feel embarrassed looking you
in the eyes. And how can I live with Alizay? I have no respect or place in her eyes and if I tell you the truth, she wants to live with me out of
stubbornness and not out of her love. Who is there? Greetings brother Jamshed. You are here at this hour? All okay? Madam Ramsha, Afnan… Mr. Afnan had an accident. What? How? I just got a call from home,
his car had an accident. Yes, but where is Afnan?
What happened to him? Is he fine? I don’t know that. But I have heard they took him
to the hospital. Okay I am bringing my shawl, you please take me to the hospital 
right now. But Madam Ramsha… There is no time for ifs and buts, 
brother Jamshed, he is in the hospital, 
I am just bringing my shawl. Just wait I am coming. Alizeh, my child, stay strong, Afnan will get well, by God’s will. How did all this happen, mom? Alizeh, I used to tell you 
not to fight with Afnan. The impact of all these fights 
is very negative, my love. Don’t worry, he will get back to his 
consciousness, if God wills. Greetings, what happened to Afnan? 
Where is he? Is he okay? Will you tell me about Afnan’s health, 
please? Ramsha, what are you doing here? Who told you we are here? Umm, I found out that Afnan met 
an accident. Even if you found out, 
you didn’t have to come here. Why are you standing here now? 
Go away. I just want to meet Afnan for once,
I will see him and… Ramsha please, we are already 
very tensed here, don’t create more mess here please, 
go away, please. Alizeh, I… 
Ramsha, this is a hospital, do us a favor, and don’t put up
 a show here. Now go away. Madam Ramsha, stay strong, don’t worry, If God wills, nothing will happen 
to Mr. Afnan, he will get well. Brother Jamshed, Doctor was saying,
Afnan is not well. Anything can happen. So much pain. And I am so helpless, I cannot even take care of Afnan 
or see him, or even go near him. Have faith in God, He is the one 
who makes ways, have patience. Brother Jamshed, I am constantly
 trying to tell my heart but my heart is not convinced, please take me to the hospital 
again to see Afnan. I will go to Afnan take care of him, will stay close to him. I will get into Alizeh’s feet 
and beg her for Afnan. You know Madam Alizeh’s anger. She will never let you meet Mr. Afnan, she will insult you instead. But don’t worry, I will keep on updating you about 
Sir Afnan’s condition. Thank you, brother Jamshed. Is it that you don’t believe in my love? Ramsha, I love you a lot, trust me. I trust in your love that is why 
I married you. I wish, I wish, I would have believed 
in your love for me earlier, so I didn’t have to see all this today. I have hurt you but I am sorry, that is why 
I am here to apologize. What happened? Why are you looking at me like this? I am just looking that you shower so much love 
on me in a moment and then in the next moment, 
what happens to you? I am unable to understand. I am unable to understand 
that as well but I guess that is my way of loving. Forgive me, please. Ramsha? Ramsha, please listen to me, 
Ramsha? Ramsha, open the door, please. Ramsha, I know this is wrong with you
but what should I do? I am helpless. Ramsha? Okay, don’t open the door, I am a fool to be making 
so much effort. I am leaving. Bye. Alizeh, you are tired, my love, 
you must go home and rest. You are right, Mom, I am actually tired, I am unable to sit for any longer. I know, you need rest. I will stay here with Afnan. Mom, Afnan will get well, right? He will be absolutely well, my love. You will see he will get back to 
his consciousness very soon. What if he doesn’t get 
his consciousness back? Hey? You must not think like this, always expect good from God. Don’t worry, my love. If God wills. Will you be able to manage alone? Don’t worry and go home, rest at home. I will call you in case of anything. Thank you, Mom. My God, your sinner woman, I am sitting here 
in front of you, you always had mercy on me, you even granted me 
what I didn’t ask for, you have granted me 
your special blessings, but today, this sinner woman of yours, is sitting here begging in front of you, My God, give speedy recovery 
to Afnan soon, My Lord, grant good health to Afnan, Oh God, never take away 
my husband from me. My Lord, you know I have no one 
except Afnan in this world. My Lord, you have control of everything, you say be and it becomes, answer my prayers and 
make Afnan well, make Afnan well. I am asking you to take care of yourself 
and you are telling me I am getting angry at you? I mean you never used to take 
so much care of me, how are you feeling 
so much love for me? Is it because we are about 
to have a baby and that is why you are doing all this? Whatever you are thinking is right. Anyway, I like it, the way you are taking care of me. Look, I will also like it if you quit 
going to the office. Afnan, can we talk about this later? Alizeh, please go and have medicine. Mom, I don’t want to have medicine. Shall I say something? Because of your stubbornness, 
not just me, Afnan is also getting very irritated. You should be thankful to God that he has given you such 
a loving husband. Yes, my husband is so loving that 
you called him 2 hours ago, he didn’t bother to come 
and ask me. Afnan, why are you cutting the fruits, I will go say it in the kitchen, 
they will cut it for me. Hey, I know that the people 
in the kitchen can cut it for you but you don’t eat it from them. 
Here, have it. Afnan, I had tea just a while ago, I am not in the mood to have fruits at all. Alizeh, can you ever listen to me? Ma’am, get this medicine from outside. Okay I will. 
Okay. Look Afnan, I am here to meet you. Afnan, open your eyes, look at me, talk to me, Afnan. Forgive me Afnan, I should have not fought with you 
and sent you that day, I shouldn’t have fought with you at all. All this has happened because of me, whatever is your condition right now, 
it is because of me. Open your eyes once and forgive me, 
Afnan, please. Please Afnan, open your eyes 
and talk to me. I have come here after 
so much difficulty, they are not even letting me meet you, they are not even letting me see you. How do you feel now, Afnan? Way better than before. My head hurts a lot, but I don’t remember since how long
I have been here at the hospital. Don’t think much, The Doctor has said 
that you need rest, if you will think, you are obviously 
going to get a headache. You will see you are gradually 
going to get well, you just need rest. Thank God that you are 
out of danger now. Alizeh, doctors have allowed us 
to take Afnan home. You go and ask them how the medicines 
are supposed to be given. Okay, I will go ask, you sit. How are you feeling now, Afnan? I am better now. Thank God, you get back 
your consciousness, you have no idea 
how worried we were, you come home well and 
I will give charity for you. Okay. You know it very well I will never cause 
you any pain on purpose and I don’t want you to get into 
any trouble because of me. I know. You know it but you still hurt me. I am sorry, I got angry all of a sudden, but you are right that it doesn’t me 
I should shout at you, that is why, I am sorry. It’s okay I forgive you. Hey, I am saying I realize my mistake, I know you have been hurt 
because of me. It is your job to hurt me, it’s nothing new. No problem. 
Ramsha? Ramsha, please listen to me, 
Ramsha? Ramsha, open the door, please. Ramsha, I know this is wrong with you
but what should I do? I am helpless. Ramsha? Okay, don’t open the door, I am a fool to be making 
so much effort. I am leaving. 
Bye. Greetings, brother Jamshed, you here at this time? 
Is everything okay? Madam Ramsha, that Afnan… Sir Afnan had an accident. What? How? I have just got a call from home, 
his car met an accident. Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha? Hello? 
Hello, brother Jamshed, Madam Ramsha is not home, 
has she gone somewhere? I have been ringing her doorbell 
for so long she is not opening the door. No, no, she is at home, 
you ring the doorbell again. Okay I will ring the doorbell 
again and see, I will also wait for a while, 
she might be in the washroom. Okay fine, bye. Madam Ramsha? What happened? 
You are still standing here, did Madam Ramsha not 
open the door yet? No, she is not opening the door, 
I have been standing here for so long. Brother Jamshed, I think 
there is something wrong. Do one thing, call Sir Afnan. Yes, right. What happened? 
Is he not picking up? He is not well. Okay do one thing, a gatekeeper 
is sitting downstairs, you call him he might be able 
to do something. Okay, don’t worry, Sir Afnan has 
given me a duplicate key of this flat. You are the limit, 
you thought of it so soon! Quickly open the door. Madam Ramsha? 
Madam Ramsha, Madam Ramsha, get up.
