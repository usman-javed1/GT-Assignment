[21.60] Greetings.
[22.52] Greetings.
[24.28] How are you?
[25.24] I am fine.
[26.12] You went to the doctor, 
what happened?
[28.76] The same routine stuff.
[30.28] Take care of your diet and all that.
[36.44] But yes, the doctor has said
[38.24] that I will have to go for 
an ultrasound next week.
[41.88] Okay.
[43.32] Fine.
[44.44] Afnan, now that you are here, 
should I have food served?
[47.16] Yes, aunt,
[48.08] have the food served and
[48.96] also call Ramsha,
[50.28] we will have food together.
[57.64] Ramsha is not at home,
[58.80] she has been gone 
since the afternoon.
[61.88] Where did Ramsha go?
[63.84] I don’t know.
[65.00] In fact, I thought maybe
[65.96] she would have told 
you and gone.
[74.72] No, no,
[75.64] she didn’t inform me and go.
[79.52] Greetings.
[82.36] Greetings.
[84.40] Where did you go?
[86.48] I went to uncle’s home.
[94.36] Uncle had an accident.
[115.20] I called you a lot,
[117.04] but you didn’t answer it.
[129.76] I left after telling aunt so 
that she informs you.
[142.56] Aunt, did you not tell him?
[149.16] When did you tell me?
[168.56] Hey, you please keep me
 away from these matters.
[173.04] Aunt,
[173.76] I had told you before leaving.
[191.16] And I had also said that
[192.04] Afnan isn’t answering his phone…
[193.92] how do you lie so easily?
[195.84] Ramsha.
[212.00] Ramsha, what is wrong with you?
[213.24] How are you talking to aunt?
[242.20] Does she not know how 
to talk with respect?
[243.96] How was she talking to mama?
[252.24] And you are standing there 
quietly and seeing it?
[254.24] I did scold her.
[255.40] Now should I kill her?
[264.04] Do you call this scolding?
[271.00] I saw how you scolded her.
[272.76] Come on, mama.
[397.44] In what tone did you 
talk to aunt today?
[406.36] I am seeing that day by day
[407.56] you are becoming really 
rude and disrespectful.
[412.68] Afnan, aunt is lying.
[420.76] She has always 
done this with me.
[434.80] It is all my fault,
[436.36] I shouldn’t have trusted aunt.
[447.04] You want that I care
 about a woman,
[449.28] who has only done bad with me.
[457.64] She got me kidnapped,
[458.84] she put allegations on me.
[467.52] She humiliated me in
 front of everyone,
[469.76] and you want that I clear
 my heart towards her.
[472.00] I forget everything, Afnan?
[474.16] Look Ramsha,
[476.00] every person changes themselves.
[485.04] Aunt too has changed.
[493.52] I think you should forget the past
[496.28] and start new.
[497.64] You should clean your 
heart towards her.
[499.64] Afnan, if you want to clean your
 heart towards her, then you do it.
[502.40] I don’t want it.
[509.36] After all, if aunt has changed,
[510.92] then she has only changed for you.
[519.96] For me, she is still the same.
[521.40] She has the same poison for 
me in her heart like earlier.
[531.16] I have always tolerated 
her injustice.
[538.12] But now,
[539.76] I will not tolerate all this, Afnan.
[542.48] Whatever it is Ramsha,
[544.44] aunt is the elder of this family
[555.56] and you should respect 
her because of this.
[565.60] I shouldn’t see you misbehaving
 with her after today,
[567.76] or it wont be good.
[605.84] I am so sorry aunt. I am so sorry.
[608.24] Watch where you are going.
[610.08] Where are you going 
in such a hurry?
[611.44] Where are you going?
[612.28] Uncle had an accident, Annie called.
[614.36] I have been calling Afnan for so long,
[616.32] but he is not answering,
[617.28] so I am going myself.
[618.96] Aunt, as soon as Afnan,
[620.16] you tell him I went to uncle’s home.
[622.40] Yes, yes, I will tell him.
[624.68] Aunt, please tell him
[626.08] or else he will worry.
[627.56] Obviously,
[628.32] what is there to forget in this,
[629.28] you go without worrying.
[630.32] Okay fine. Thank you. Bye.
[645.80] Nothing more can happen apart
 from what has happened.
[649.76] I am only disappointed
[653.20] that we are getting married 
because of that stain you
[660.60] have put on my character and
 not out of our love.
[672.60] I will have to live up to this relation 
because of all that happened.
[676.92] I have no fault in all 
that has happened.
[679.68] Why don’t you understand, 
Afnan?
[680.48] Whatever happened,
 shouldn’t have happened
[683.96] but from today, 
you are my respect.
[689.52] I will try that
[692.24] at least this time you are not 
able to tarnish my respect.
[720.44] Whatever I did with 
you was wrong.
[725.24] Oh wow,
[726.92] it is good that you realized it.
[729.68] Did you not realize it soon, Shani?
[733.56] But you know,
[735.60] now this realization is 
of no use for you,
[737.88] nor is it of any use for me.
[743.20] That’s why it is better
[744.20] that you bury this 
realization inside you.
[747.84] I regret losing you.
[751.28] You know Shani,
[753.56] when you don’t realize on time,
[759.80] then just like that,regret and sorrow.
[771.24] What nonsense is this?
[773.28] A mother really worries for their child.
[775.80] A mother really cares for her child.
[778.64] You don’t realize it today,
[780.84] one day when you become a father,
[783.08] when your own child is unwell,
[784.76] that when you will realize
[786.16] what taking care of a child is like.
[787.96] Come on,
[789.24] now here, have the soup.
[791.44] Drink it.
[793.12] I am just drinking it for you.
[800.32] Show me.
[801.16] I am making you drink it.
[806.44] Oh.
[816.60] Listen.
[821.24] Now that you have brought it,
[822.68] make me wear it too.
[832.12] Please.
[834.40] Okay.
[852.96] Now give me the other one.
[853.88] Yes.
[878.40] It looks nice.
[882.08] I mean that, look,
[885.56] you are worried there too,
[886.60] you are not well.
[888.56] You must have issues
 moving around
[890.88] and I am little worried here,
[892.52] I cannot find my things,
[894.24] so I will come.
[898.64] Yes, but who told you that
[900.28] I am worried here?
[902.08] I am absolutely fine.
[903.44] I didn’t come to stay at uncle’s 
home for the first time.
[906.60] I have spent a long time here.
[908.92] So you don’t worry about me.
[912.16] Yes, if you don’t like it there,
[915.60] and you want that I come there,
[917.88] then say that.
[919.92] No, no,
[921.88] there is nothing like that.
[924.28] I like it here. I really like it here.
[927.36] In fact, today the room
 is really peaceful
[929.80] and I will sleep peacefully.
[933.08] Really?
[934.28] Then sleep peacefully.
[972.12] Hello.
[974.76] Ramsha.
[979.32] Why did you call so late at night,
 Shani?
[981.76] Ramsha, listen to me.
[984.88] I cannot find peace.
[995.16] Please forgive me.
[1005.60] My heart cannot find peace.
[1008.64] Have you lost your mind, Shani?
[1010.68] Did you call me so late at night
 to talk this nonsense?
[1014.84] Yes. I am…I am sorry,
[1016.72] I shouldn’t have called at this time.
[1031.12] Who are you talking to?
[1125.72] Afnan…
[1127.72] Don’t lie to me.
[1131.44] You know, aunt is right about you.
[1134.68] Girls like you are not worth trusting.
[1138.48] I had lost my mind that
[1139.80] I came upstairs to see if
 injustice is being done to you,
[1142.68] are you crying?
[1143.72] But it is good that I came,
[1145.12] at least my eyes have 
been opened.
[1148.60] What are you saying Afnan?
[1150.52] There is nothing like that.
[1151.28] You are thinking wrong.
[1152.16] You listen…
[1152.88] I am thinking wrong?
[1154.88] Me, Ramsha?
[1156.72] Hey, you don’t want to understand.
[1159.68] I am taking so much pain for you,
[1161.56] I am trying to make you 
understand with love, but you?
[1164.04] Girls like you cannot 
understand anything,
[1166.52] ever. You do what you want to.
[1169.16] No Afnan, there is nothing like that.
[1170.60] You listen to me…
[1171.68] I don’t want to hear you, Ramsha.
[1176.52] You know,
[1177.28] having hopes from you is wrong.
[1182.84] Hey, it is my fault. It is my mistake,
[1185.84] that I thought,
[1186.88] you will change your ways,
[1188.16] you will come back to me, but no.
[1191.60] The one who has looked away,
[1194.40] you can stop their way,
[1197.00] but you cannot change
 their direction.
[1202.48] You want to go to your
 uncle’s home, right?
[1205.20] You find peace and
 comfort there.
[1208.12] Come on. Come, 
I will take you there.
[1211.20] There is nothing like that, 
Afnan, you…
[1212.52] Don’t be unjust with me, 
come on. Come.
[1214.24] Afnan,
[1214.96] what are you doing?
[1215.92] Oh yes, I forgot.
[1217.56] You will not go there for one day.
[1220.80] Now you will have to go permanently.
[1222.64] So your bags should be packed too.
[1224.72] Come on, tell me,
[1225.56] should I pack your bags 
or will you do it?
[1228.00] Afnan listen to me.
[1228.72] You wont agree like this.
[1229.76] You are being cunning again.
[1231.28] I will pack your bags.
[1232.48] Afnan, there is nothing like that.
[1233.56] What is wrong with you, Afnan?
[1237.04] Afnan, listen…
[1245.08] Go from here.
[1246.16] Everyone will see. Leave.
[1250.20] Why are you acting so pure?
[1252.52] Huh?
[1254.24] Have you forgotten your past?
[1258.08] I knew it.
[1259.48] I was well aware of you
 being a low life.
[1262.04] Yes, I am a lowlife.
[1263.12] You recognized me correctly.
[1265.28] And after marriage you
 will realize that
[1267.16] I am not just a lowlife,
[1269.28] I am also really cheap.
[1270.76] Because I remember 
every single thing
[1274.92] and I will take revenge for 
everything one by one.
[1279.04] What did they call you?
[1282.28] Shopping girl.
[1290.00] The fish is the queen of the water,
[1293.80] her life is in the water.
[1300.28] If you touch her, she will get scared.
[1308.08] If you take her out,
[1309.80] she will die.
[1318.12] You know what?
[1319.88] I used to think in childhood
 what this means,
[1325.04] I understood it, today.
[1348.08] Your wedding gift.
[1358.72] This was your wedding gift.
[1393.16] Sit. Sit.
[1398.12] Hey. Hey.
[1400.40] Ramsha. Ramsha.
[1403.24] Mama.
[1405.28] Ramsha. Ramsha.
[1408.40] Mama. Ramsha.
[1412.32] Ramsha. Mama.
[1430.76] You people are not listening to me.
[1432.80] Listen…
[1433.68] stop it!
[1436.52] Now I will not hear a word
[1437.68] and no one will listen to her here.
[1444.44] I will not tolerate you in 
my life for a moment,
[1447.36] and I…
[1448.96] Shani listen to me.
[1451.20] Ramsha, I divorce you.
[1454.80] I divorce you.
[1457.72] I divorce you.
[1485.72] Come on, get off the car.
[1488.36] Forgive me once.
[1496.68] Afnan, it will not happen again.
[1505.48] I am accepting my mistake
[1506.64] and I am apologizing to you too.
[1508.48] You didn’t make a mistake,
[1510.92] you committed a sin.
[1522.16] Cheating your husband is a sin.
[1526.60] Afnan,
[1527.68] if a person is embarrassed 
on what they did,
[1529.36] then even God forgives them.
[1539.24] Forgive me, please, Afnan.
[1542.40] God is really merciful to His servants.
[1553.68] A man is not that great.
[1562.32] You pray that,
[1564.60] God makes my heart 
soft towards you.
[1574.12] But right now, I have no 
room for you in my heart.
[1577.28] Afnan.
[1642.28] Here, have tea.
[1643.36] And you stop having too much tea,
[1646.36] your diabetes will increase.
[1648.20] Hmmm.
[1653.40] Who is here at this hour?
[1654.48] I don’t know. I will see.
[1697.84] Ramsha.
[1700.64] Greetings.
[1702.04] Greetings.
[1704.04] You came alone?
[1705.88] No Afnan dropped me.
[1715.20] Actually, he is going abroad.
[1717.52] Yes.
[1718.16] and it will take him some time
 to come back as well.
[1719.60] So he said
[1720.48] I should come and stay 
with you people here.
[1723.04] Ramsha.
[1723.96] Greetings.
[1724.76] Greetings.
[1726.40] Child, all okay,
[1727.56] you are here at this hour?
[1728.92] And where is Afnan?
[1735.12] No Afnan, dropped me and went.
[1747.16] Actually,
[1748.28] he has a flight, he has to go.
[1749.88] He is going abroad.
[1764.52] So he said
[1765.36] I should stay with you people 
for a few days.
[1767.56] Okay. Okay.
[1770.12] Annie,
[1770.88] take your sister to the room.
[1772.76] Come, Ramsha.
