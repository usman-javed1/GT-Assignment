Compartment number 11482. It is not here. 11483. Twenty five. Yes, bring it. You are bringing two sacks. Look at your strength 
and look at the sacks. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hello. Be quick. Brother. Brother. What happened? I don’t know. Who called? How would I know? He was standing so close to you, 
did you not hear? I was working. Fahad, you bothered for no reason. How will you go so far and then come back.
 I would have gone myself. You surprise me, buddy. What is the friendship in 
which there is botheration. That is true. Believe me, 
no one bothers me more than you. You know there is a thing, 
you are a great actor. Actor reminds me, how is that new friend of yours? She makes amazing reels. I in fact, follow her. Really? Tell me, do you talk to her or not? No, I don’t talk to her now. That is good. Let me be her friend. Why? Hey, when you have ended friendship with her,
 then I will become her friend. I cannot give you her number, 
I have deleted it. Why? You were saying she is really interesting
 and you have a lot of fun talking to her. Yes, that is why deleted it, that is why whenever I want to talk to her, I am unable to. Hey, man, 
you should have asked me once. We would have also seen 
what is so special about that girl, that our friend was taking 
so much interest in her. Okay don’t bother me,
 make me reach the airport quickly. If I miss the flight, 
then dad will scold me. Drive fast. I am driving. I am driving.
 You wont miss your flight. What did Ramsha do? What did she do. It was better that she would have
 given us  poison before doing all this. It would have been better that 
we would have died before seeing all this. What will say to his father? What will I say? What did she do. Oh God. Sister in law, what is the point of crying now? I used to already tell you not to give her 
so much freedom and leniency. Salma, I didn’t know, I had no idea, this girl would ruin 
our respect and go like this. Annie, tell us honestly, if you know anything about Ramsha, 
or did she tell you anything? Child, if you know anything, then tell us. Make me swear on anyone, mama. I honestly don’t know anything. Yes, how is it possible that you know nothing? You two were together twenty four hours. She used to share everything with you. She must have told her and gone. Her, for God’s sake, child, 
tell me if you know even a little about her. I am speaking the truth, elder mama, if I had any idea she was going to do all this,
 I would have told you first. Where is she? What happened? Where is Ramsha? What nonsense were you
 speaking on the phone? Ramsha left the home and went. How did she leave the home 
and go in your presence? Did you go blind? I don’t understand anything. I don’t know how all this happened.
I know nothing. How did she leave? Speak up, why are you quiet now? You must have heard something. Brother Sajid, Ramsha, gave this and went. Hey, man, I had to run out of water right now. Why are the shops closed? God forgive me, if the water flows like this,
then the bottle will get filled till tomorrow. Stop. Stop. My bag! Hey, don’t you understand me? I told you all my things were left in the train, 
you are not ready to listen. I am telling you, if my luggage is not returned, I will teach you people 
a lesson you wont forget. After all, you don’t know who I am. The entire social media will 
reach here on one cry of mine. Madam, who told you to get off the train? And you can do what you want. Okay? And if your things go missing, 
then you will be responsible for it, not us. How will I be responsible? You people are responsible
 for all of my worries. All this happened cause of you. After all, the beautiful taps of this beautiful
 station has water dripping from it. How will a person fill their bottle? A person’s patience runs out, and if a person wants to wash their face... ...then you miss your train
 instead of washing your face. You people are really stubborn.
You don’t realize my worry at all. Madam, who had told you to get off 
at the station and wash your face? Hey, you should have washed 
your face at home and come. Oh brother, what? Have you seen your trains? Even if a person showers and comes,
 they are in such a bad state, it feels like you are walking in desert
 and not in a train. Look, I am giving you the last warning. I am saying it for the last time that
 if I don’t get my things back, I will not leave anyone. I have told you this. Okay madam, fine,
 you sit comfortably in this train, I will find out. I sit comfortably? My things went missing and 
you want me to sit comfortably? Brother Hamid, before this 
girl creates further problems for us, do something about her.
 Solve her problem. Okay fine, Mr. Kamal, you get on this train with 
this girl and go to the next station. The train will stay there for one hour, 
give her, her luggage. Come madam, 
I will get you, your things. I am telling you, if I don’t get my luggage, 
then I will not leave you. Come, you will get your luggage. 
Come on, then. This girl is a big problem, she has worried me. If you ask me honestly,
 I still don’t believe it. How can Ramsha do this? She is fooling you people. She didn’t leave the home and go, 
she ran away with some boy. I don’t know you people didn’t find out, 
but I could see clearly from her actions, that this will happen. She was having an affair 
with someone, she ran with him. Shani, what are you saying? Brother Sajid and sister in law are already sad, 
they are in so much pain. Hearing you talk will hurt them further. Mama, whatever I am saying 
I am saying it with confidence. She had an affair with a boy,
and she ran away with him. You see yourself, as soon as her
 proposal came she left the home. Did you see yourself? No, right? You didn’t see with your own eyes, right? If you didn’t see it, then be quiet. Control your tongue. Fine, I will stay quiet, 
but how many people will you shut up? What do you think? 
In today’s time this thing will not get out? Wont people talk? You will see how people find out. Who all will you shut up? You know well who I am talking about. Tell me who that boy is, 
I will go get her myself. I don’t know anything. I know nothing. Stop supporting her, I am telling you 
or else I will break your face. Shani, control your anger. If Annie is saying she knows nothing, then trust your sister. She knows nothing. You are trusting her like
 elder papa trusted Ramsha. Today, the result of it is in front of you. Yes, who are you? Greetings. Greetings. My name is Ramsha, 
I came to meet Mr. Danish Kamal. Brother Mukhtayar, come here. She has come to meet sir. I want to meet Mr. Danish Kamal. 
I am Ramsha, I have come from Karachi. Come. Yes. Fine, I am coming. Come on. Hi sir. I am Ramsha. Ramsha. Shameer sent you. Yes. What did he tell you about me? Shameer was saying you are a famous director
and you will cast me in your new project. Mukhtar. Yes, sir? Take Miss Ramsha to the guest room. You go, rest. We will talk in the morning tomorrow. Sir, Shameer was saying 
I will stay in a hotel room. Forget about what Shameer was telling you, just listen to what I am saying. Yes, sir. This is better for your tomorrow. Yes, okay, sir. And listen, you will get all those facilities in this home, that you don’t even get in a five star hotel. Yes, come on. Elder papa, I have served food. Should I already eat food? The home where there is a funeral, there, you eat food after the burial. Right now, I have lead my daughter’s funeral. Then I will eat. Sajid, don’t say that. Pray to God that wherever 
our daughter is, she is fine. She is dead for me. Mourn her today. After today, no one will 
take her name in this home. God will be kind. She is dead. Did you hear me? Brother. Brother, get a grip on yourself. What did she do with me? She killed me in my life. How will I face people? How will I tell them that... ...my daughter ran away from home. Brother. While leaving, why did she not kill me and go. Stop it, brother. Stop it. Get a grip on yourself. You will make yourself sick this way. Don’t say that. Come, sit here. Come. Come. No. let me be. Brother. Let me be. This is the same actress, 
who was on TV… and this? Mr. Qavi Khan, wow. Mr. Behrooz and Mr. Javed. Oh my God, such big actors and also Maya Ali. I am so lucky that... ...I am going to work with such 
a great man in the start of my career. God, thank you. Thank you. My future is made. It is surely made. You know, this is what you call a home. So beautiful, so grand. And then there was our home, go from one home to another room, 
and from there to the lounge and that’s it. You know, Ramsha, don’t worry, one day you will also have all this. Such a big home. Money. Cars. You will have everything, and you will see, mama and papa will agree just like that. When they will see I have so much money, 
home, cars, they will agree immediately. You know, papa must have really scolded mama. He must be saying that Mehnaz, 
Ramsha ran away from home, it is all your fault, and poor mama must be crying. I am sorry, mama. Because of me you must
 be getting scolded by mama. But what can I do? If you people had given 
me permission for all this, then I wouldn’t have had 
to take such a big step. Anyway, whatever happened, happened. One day my picture will also be here. Madam. 
Yes? Boss is calling you. Fine, you go ahead, I will come. I hope he didn’t hear what I was saying. My picture will also be here one day,
you people will see. Good morning. I…I saw your pictures,
that are there on the wall. You have worked with really famous actors. I didn’t work with them, they have worked with me. Okay. You don’t worry, really soon, your picture will be with me, in a frame and put up on the wall. There is a character in my serial. Really great. There is a lot of demand. Really? What is the character? That’s the issue with you girls. You people want that 
you people get everything really quickly. Have a little patience, calmly and with patience. I will give you the script, read it.
Read your character, then we will discuss. Okay sir, done. I will do as you say. That’s what I want. Should I tell you something? I really like girls like you. Okay. Excuse me. Hello. Yes. What? No, no, no, no, the same location. Hey, yes. I will be offered such a character 
that will have a lot of demand. Oh my God, you will make it big. Where did you go, Ramsha? Did you go with Afnan… No. No. You cannot do this, right? Who were you talking to? To no one. I ask you, who were you talking to? I think you too plan on running 
away from here like Ramsha. Shani! What are you saying about your sister? If Ramsha has gone from this home, or she has run away with someone, then my daughter has no fault in it.
 Understand? Mama, keep her phone with you. And after today, if I see this
 phone in your hands, I will break it. And if you want to talk to someone, then either do it from mama’s phone 
or through papa’s phone. Understand? I was not talking to anyone. Hello. Yes, who is it? Ramsha? What number are you calling from? I was ignoring this number for 
so long that it is a wrong number. I didn’t like the package of that sim, 
so that’s why. Okay, anyway, Afnan, leave all this,
 where are you? I have come for so many days,
 you didn’t meet me once. I didn’t have this number of yours saved. Okay, how is your shoot going?
You came here for a shoot, right? Shoot. The shoot has still not started.
 I am free. So where, 
which hotel are you staying in? Hotel? No, no, I am in no hotel. 
I am staying at the director’s home. Director’s home? Are you not uneasy there? Anyway, I am busy for the next two to three days,
 I will tell you when I am free. I am going for a meeting, you called so I stopped 
the car answered your call. No, no, no, you meet me today. I have been here for so many days. 
Afnan, I am bored. You meet me today,
 I will get ready quickly. Hello? Afnan? He cuts the call on my face. Sister in law, if anyone asks you about Ramsha, then you tell them clearly that
 she went to her aunt’s home in Nawabshah. For how long, Salma? How long do we lie to people? I don’t know sister in law. I don’t know what else this time will show us. Even Nabeel’s family called. They were asking about the engagement. I didn’t understand anything, I just made an excuse that Ramsha 
went to Nawabshah to her aunt’s home, still they were insisting 
that as soon as Ramsha comes, they will come immediately
 for the engagement. Sister in law, I didn’t understand anything,
 I just made an excuse. Look Salma, you tell them that we don’t plan 
getting her engaged right now. I am unable to think myself. I don’t understand anything. You somehow say no to the engagement, that we cannot do anything. Say anything. Okay, I will talk to them don’t worry. Salma, if they say that they want to talk to me, then tell them I am unwell. Make an excuse. I cannot talk. What will I talk about? What do I do? Oh God. Annie. Yes, elder mama, all okay? Yes. I want to talk to you. Yes? Look Annie, whatever we talk about it 
will be limited to this room... ...and whatever I find out from you, I will not say anything to anyone, 
that I found out from you. I will not tell anyone anything. If you mean Ramsha and you want to
 know something about Ramsha, then I have already told you. I know nothing. How do you not know anything? You are her cousin. Not just her cousin,
 you are her best friend too. How can I believe that 
she didn’t say anything to you. She used to share everything with you. Do you not feel any 
sympathy towards me? The one standing in front 
of you is such a helpless mother, who knows nothing about her daughter. I don’t know 
what condition my daughter is in. thinking about her, I have not been 
able to sleep for a moment, even. I stay awake for her all night long. I don’t know where my daughter is,
 if she is safe or not. Look here, I beg you. I beg you, Annie, if you know anything about her, 
child, please, for God’s sake, tell me, I wont say anything. I wont tell anyone that you
 told me anything. Please, child. Don’t embarrass me elder mama,
 you please sit. Elder mama, I am speaking the truth, I know nothing where Ramsha is. Okay child. Elder mama, Ramsha used to like a boy named Afnan. Sir, I… I…actually, I wanted 
if you give me the script, I am free all day long, 
so I will read the script. I will also check the type of character it is. Why are you worried about the script? Don’t worry. Come, sit here. Sure. Why did you sit there? Come sit here with me. I will not eat you.
