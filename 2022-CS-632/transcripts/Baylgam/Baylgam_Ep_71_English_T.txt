[21.12] It’s none of your business, 
who was I talking to?
[24.32] What is this question?
[26.96] You were talking to some girl, right?
[31.40] Ramsha, I don’t like it at all that
[33.56] anyone asks me what and 
why was I doing anything,
[36.36] do you understand?
[39.52] And you should talk to another girl 
when I am here?
[42.72] You ignore me, fight with me, 
get angry at me,
[46.32] do I like all this?
[48.08] Have you ever thought about this?
[49.76] Ramsha, don’t spoil my mood,
[51.68] accidentally I am in a good mood 
today, don’t ruin it.
[54.92] So that is what I am asking, 
why are you in such a good mood?
[58.84] You never get in such a good mood
when you look at me,
[61.28] you just fight with me all the time. 
Do you know what?
[64.84] The truth is, I am fed up with you,
[67.36] I am bored of you.
[69.84] Now do you understand?
[71.04] Why do you always become the reason
behind tears in my eyes, Shani?
[75.12] Okay enough now,
[76.48] you start crying over every little thing
[85.16] and just because of this crying face, 
I have become fed up.
[88.64] So, have you ever thought 
why do I cry, Shani?
[99.16] What kind of a husband are you, Shani?
[107.84] I am your wife, my sorrow, my pain,
[112.24] doesn’t mean anything to you?
[123.12] Husband and wife are each 
other’s clothes, Shani,
[132.32] they are each other’s support system,
[141.72] I am still very lonely and alone despite
of having you in my life.
[148.36] Do you understand why I don’t come 
into the room at night? Why do I leave?
[233.60] Hello?
[235.76] The money has been arranged. 
Where do I have to come?
[241.60] I said don’t talk rubbish, tell me 
where do I have to come?
[360.04] It is a total 20 lac rupees, 
you can count if you want to.
[388.40] There is no need to count, they must be 
complete but tell me something,
[391.80] how did you arrange such a huge 
in such less time? Hmm?
[397.32] What do you have to do with that?
[398.52] No, no, I was just asking,
[400.24] now at least your husband cannot 
give you such a huge amount,
[402.52] so I am sure you must have taken it
from someone you know,
[404.52] I understand this much,
[406.36] so tell me who did this favour on you?
[410.52] Whoever did it,
[413.56] I have never seen a bigger moron 
than you in my life,
[417.20] I hope that you will keep your moron 
self a secret and won’t show it off.
[423.08] Delete it.
[430.12] Why are you looking at me like this? 
Delete it.
[434.32] Actually, I forgot to bring 
my mobile phone
[440.40] and I don’t have my laptop in my car.
[443.56] But don’t worry,
[451.52] you just be satisfied, I hope 
you trust me that much.
[454.92] Come, let’s have tea somewhere.
[457.88] Hey? Hey?
[534.76] What option did I have except 
to give him money?
[538.44] I am helpless and I have 
to trust this moron.
[543.96] Oh God, take me out of this problem,
[547.28] what trouble have I gotten into?
[556.48] I had no idea that the mistakes I made 
in the past would become hell for me.
[632.40] Ramsha?
[638.00] Since I have been sitting here, 
I am just noticing
[640.88] that you are continuously looking 
at your phone,
[648.60] after all, what is there in your phone?
[655.72] I am just looking at the fact that 
how easy has it become to sin.
[661.60] What do you mean?
[663.88] Our mistakes and out-of-control desires
have made committing sin so easy,
[676.40] we didn’t even realize it.
[678.64] I didn’t get it, 
what are you trying to say?
[682.44] Do you know, Annie?
[684.68] People had to plan before sinning first,
[696.96] they had to spend money,
[700.20] and snatch money from people
[709.64] and now
[712.64] this little lifeless piece has become 
an easy way for people to sin.
[729.08] Now people don’t have 
to spend their money,
[732.00] they don’t have to snatch money 
from people either,
[740.52] and they don’t even have 
to take a wrong step to sin,
[750.80] in fact, just by clicking on 
this lifeless piece,
[756.84] any sin can be committed.
[766.88] The people have added poison 
in our lives
[770.92] and our upcoming generations, 
in the name of entertainment,
[776.40] it is very difficult to save yourself 
from it.
[787.76] I wish our parents would have 
restricted us.
[802.36] Mom and dad stopped me so much
[806.44] but I, I didn’t even realize,
[812.24] I realize it today,
[817.20] I wish Mom and Dad would have
restricted my pointless wishes.
[823.56] I wish I would have been saved 
from this temptation.
[828.80] Annie, I have decided
[831.24] that when God bless me with a child,
[834.12] I will restrict my child,
[844.72] I will keep my child away 
from this temptation
[847.92] that has been given to us 
in the name of technology,
[853.32] very far.
[926.80] Hey?
[929.16] Asim.
[931.04] Hey, Asim, how did you think of me?
[933.64] Where are you right now?
[937.92] I am at the shop, working.
[940.08] Can you come to me right now?
[943.00] I Just told you that I am at work, 
working, dad is here too.
[945.96] Let’s sit somewhere and talk,
[947.68] there is something very important 
that I need to tell you.
[949.92] Tell me what is it?
[951.92] Dude, it is regarding 
sister-in-law Ramsha.
[970.40] okay,
[972.20] fine, I am coming.
[977.96] Dad, I have some important work, 
I will be back in a while.
[981.32] Are you in your senses?
[984.24] You even know that 
the boys are off today,
[986.60] I have work load here and 
I cannot do it all alone.
[989.00] Do your work, go.
[1003.40] Sha.. Sha…
[1004.68] Shani? Shani?
[1009.56] What a useless child,
[1012.16] it would have been better…
[1015.52] Oh Dude, he left the work 
in the middle.
[1024.40] How are you? 
I am fine.
[1027.72] Why have you called me here?
[1031.12] Asim didn’t call you, I did.
[1036.96] So, you did?
[1044.96] Yes,
[1046.64] I wanted to talk to you about 
something important.
[1058.60] Sit down.
[1126.60] Hi sir, I am Ramsha.
[1183.12] did you get scared?
[1186.64] No, sir, I am not scared of anyone.
[1190.00] Actually, I didn’t expect you to come
into my room without knocking.
[1193.88] Sorry, I came because
[1195.96] I wanted you to wear that dress 
and show it to me,
[1199.04] the one that I bought for you.
[1202.64] Why?
[1204.20] I mean, are we going somewhere?
[1206.24] No.
[1208.56] I want to see you in that dress,
[1212.12] so
[1214.52] hurry up and get ready and come,
[1216.92] I am waiting.
[1218.48] Okay sir.
[1224.44] When I saw you for the first time,
[1228.24] I was able to figure out
[1231.04] that one day you will become 
a huge star.
[1234.68] That is why I have even 
spoken to Shahmeer.
[1239.12] Sit down.
[1283.48] How do you know my wife?
[1285.68] Knowing looks like a very small 
and common word,
[1288.80] anyway, no problem,
[1291.80] Asim didn’t tell you in detail, right?
[1295.12] What details?
[1296.56] Wait a second,
[1298.56] I have proofs.
[1300.96] Look, look at this video.
[1381.84] Afnan,
[1383.36] what have you done to the room?
[1385.24] Your clothes are messed up 
everywhere,
[1387.36] where should I sit?
[1388.36] I just came back from the office and I don’t
know I was shocked to see it, what is this?
[1392.28] What should I do?
[1393.80] I cannot find my grey suit, 
I have been late,
[1401.52] I had to be somewhere, 
please take it out for me.
[1404.48] What do I know where your suit is?
[1411.00] Tabassum keeps your clothes 
in place, she would know it.
[1418.72] And she is off today anyway,
[1421.44] I will ask her when she 
comes back tomorrow.
[1427.72] Please wear something else 
right now and go clean the room.
[1431.36] You are my wife, not Tabassum
[1433.84] that I should ask everything 
to Tabassum.
[1441.44] I gave my suit for dry cleaning,
[1443.32] you should have kept it 
when it came back.
[1449.24] Now go and find it for me.
[1451.96] Afnan, please, 
don’t talk like a fool with me.
[1457.56] I am not being a fool,
[1460.28] I am reminding you about your work.
[1468.52] And if you come very tired from 
the office, it is not my fault.
[1475.56] If this house is causing you trouble 
so then go back to the office.
[1479.52] What the hell, Afnan?
[1481.16] I came early from the office 
so I can rest for a while,
[1484.12] I have a headache
[1491.44] but I don’t have any peace
in this house too.
[1493.80] So I told you the solution,
[1495.68] you may go and find your solution,
[1497.96] I will solve my problem here, myself.
[1505.76] You have been going mad yourself
and you are going to make me mad too.
[1514.32] My suit. Leave it, you can’t take it out,
I will look for it myself.
[1521.92] What the hell?
[1529.04] What rubbish is this?
[1531.92] Don’t make me a fool,
[1534.80] this is all fake.
[1536.88] When brother Danish told me 
about sister-in-law Ramsha,
[1539.80] even I thought this is false
[1541.92] but it is true, my friend.
[1544.64] What’s true in it?
[1546.04] You think I am a kid?
[1551.24] Do I live in some ancient times
 that I don’t know
[1553.80] everything like this can be 
made nowadays.
[1559.04] And you must have some shame too.
[1562.44] Aren’t you ashamed of talking rubbish 
regarding my wife?
[1567.60] What grudge do you have with her?
[1569.40] You must ask this question to 
yourself instead of me.
[1578.40] What grudge can I have 
with your wife?
[1588.12] If I had to defame any girl,
[1591.04] is your wife the only one left 
in this whole world?
[1598.36] I can even defame any other girl.
[1602.60] My friend, try to understand
[1604.68] sister-in-law is not a nice woman.
[1606.88] Shut the hell up.
[1608.40] Enough is enough, 
do you understand?
[1615.72] Okay I admit,
[1619.68] all this is fake and a lie,
[1622.60] but you do accept
[1624.68] that your wife went viral by the name
 of Shopping Girl?
[1641.68] And then
[1643.72] she even eloped from her house? 
I know it very well,
[1651.48] what do you think I don’t know all this?
 And yes,
[1655.08] acting was her hobby,
[1660.36] she left her house for a while 
and went with a friend.
[1666.08] You are such a fool.
[1675.96] I am sorry but you are a big fool
[1678.92] who married a girl like Ramsha.
[1690.04] She didn’t go to her friend
[1692.68] but was with me, in my home for 
so many days, in Islamabad.
[1705.80] Shut your rubbish, 
I won’t tolerate it anymore.
[1708.80] Okay, fine, fine.
[1711.44] If you don’t believe in these pictures 
and videos, that is fine,
[1714.64] but if you want to increase your suffering 
then I have no objection.
[1725.96] I will give you proof myself, 
regarding your wife and that too, live.
[1742.12] Look here and tell me,
[1744.96] do you have the courage? 
Do you?
[1757.04] Now don’t make the mistake of going
 and asking all this to your wife,
[1762.92] else she will make you 
a fool all your life.
[1775.12] Now go
[1777.64] and wait.
[1821.56] You are such a fool.
[1823.40] I am sorry but you are a big fool
[1826.20] who married a girl like Ramsha.
[1832.20] She didn’t go to her friend
[1835.00] but was with me, in my home 
for so many days,
[1838.68] in Islamabad.
[1860.52] Shani,
[1862.60] where were you?
Do you know
[1865.04] uncle has been waiting for you for so long
and was getting angry at you.
[1867.88] Do one thing, freshen up,
I will serve food for you, okay?
[1873.92] I am not hungry.
[1967.92] If you don’t believe in these pictures 
and videos, that is fine,
[1971.20] but if you want to increase your 
suffering then I have no objection.
[1982.40] I will give you proof myself, 
regarding your wife and that too, live.
[1998.68] Look here and tell me,
[2001.44] do you have the courage? 
Do you?
[2077.88] Why do you want to meet me now?
[2079.92] You said you will take the money 
and delete the pictures
[2084.88] then, so now why do you want 
to meet me?
[2090.80] Now delete my pictures and 
stop being after my life.
[2094.20] You are being angry for no reason,
[2096.28] I just want to delete them 
in front of you.
[2106.20] That is why just come to meet me once,
[2108.60] and this will be last time.
[2110.64] Whether the pictures get deleted 
in front of me or behind my back,
[2114.32] the only thing that matters to me is 
that they should be deleted
[2116.56] and you stop being after my life.
[2118.92] That is why I am asking you 
to come just one last time,
[2129.44] if you won’t come.
[2135.00] Now you are backing out from 
your words, Danish Kamal.
[2149.60] This is not right.
[2151.36] If you actually want to get rid of me 
then I am sure
[2156.16] that you will come, 
you will definitely come.
[2165.80] Okay, that’s it,
[2167.24] I am waiting for you now.
[2176.40] Come soon.
[2178.40] Bye, bye, bye.
