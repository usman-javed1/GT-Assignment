[42.96] Afnan,
[46.36] you have done wrong 
with my daughter.
[57.52] I don’t get it myself that 
what is happening with me.
[69.44] the ground is feeling insufficient to me.
[80.52] Since Dad has left,
[84.12] all the happiness and ease has 
gone away from my life.
[98.48] It feels like I have just gotten alone.
[105.12] You are responsible for 
this loneliness too.
[115.12] I am surprised that an intelligent 
man like you,
[120.00] how can he make such 
a huge mistake.
[136.08] You married Ramsha.
[147.00] Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys
[154.20] who are family-oriented and rich too,
[157.12] they marry them
[166.60] and that is what Ramsha did too.
[178.96] You are honorable, family-oriented,
[181.32] and rich too,
[189.00] she married you and defamed you
[198.20] and then she got famous overnight
[207.36] because that is what she wanted.
[217.72] Since that video has gone viral,
[220.32] do you have any idea how I am getting
 so many phone calls?
[231.76] From family, outsiders,
[240.16] I am getting so many phone calls that
I had to switch off my phone.
[255.28] Afnan, if you don't believe me,
[258.60] then go,
[260.08] go open social media,
[269.12] it is full of girls like Ramsha,
[281.76] who have trapped guys like you 
overnight and got famous.
[300.28] And by the way,
[302.40] you are not the first man 
in Ramsha’s life,
[305.20] I don’t know how many men before you… 
Enough Aunt,
[309.08] enough.
[317.96] Ramsha is not that type of girl,
[329.12] she has changed herself.
[333.64] She hasn’t changed,
[341.72] she just put on this character,
[353.56] and she got successful in it.
[365.44] And my daughter,
[370.44] wrong happened to my daughter.
[388.88] I have an idea that
[391.32] you are worried because 
of the children.
[394.44] Brother I have tried talking to Alizey,
[398.20] but she doesn’t give me 
any response.
[402.44] You must talk to Afnan,
[404.84] in fact, I would suggest you make both
of them sit face-to-face, and talk to the point.
[409.28] You are right,
[411.88] that is what I am thinking too,
[413.68] the environment of the house 
has become strange.
[417.12] Brother, we got them hooked up 
with so much love and integrity
[424.72] and I thought that my daughter 
would stay in front of my eyes
[429.28] but everything is upside down here.
[463.48] I cannot stay, try and understand, 
I have a problem.
[466.60] I don’t want to understand 
anything, Afnan,
[468.92] if you don’t stay here today, 
I will get upset.
[472.80] okay now you see, 
you are threatening me.
[477.32] Now it’s up to you if you think it 
as a threat or love.
[482.16] What is this?
[484.52] You are acting very selfishly.
[487.40] A person sometimes becomes selfish 
in love and there is nothing wrong with it.
[500.16] Afnan, stay away from me.
[505.32] Please stay away from me.
[508.88] Alizey, cool down and listen to me,
[511.36] I am telling you that you…
I don’t want to listen to anything,
[514.56] you did what you wanted to.
[523.28] I don’t want to listen to anything 
you want to say,
[526.72] I am hating you, your existence,
your presence.
[543.36] what did you think Afnan?
[546.16] What did you think that I will cry like a 
typical woman and die in the corner?
[551.72] Not at all,
[553.56] you have killed me 
while I am still alive,
[555.60] but I will kill you and that Ramsha.
[561.08] Listen Alizey…
[562.00] Now just wait and watch what I do.
[565.36] Alizey, listen to me, you are angry ..
[567.76] No Afnan, I am not angry,
[576.48] I guess you are not listening 
to me Afnan,
[580.00] just wait and watch I do now with you.
[682.04] Alizey?
[683.04] Alizey, please listen to me, 
please open the door,
[684.80] we can talk about this, please.
[686.08] Afnan, go away from here.
[687.64] Alizey, please.
[688.56] I don’t even want to see your face. 
Alizey, please listen to me.
[690.68] I am telling you to go away!
I can explain why I did all this.
[692.52] Alizey, don’t do this, Alizey, 
Please open the door.
[694.44] Quiet. Go away!
[862.00] I couldn’t even imagine Afnan 
that you will become my destiny.
[872.80] okay so why are you crying?
[877.92] This is not the time to cry.
[886.92] I am not crying,
[889.16] these are the tears of joy.
[898.68] I am happy.
[901.24] Every moment of our life 
from now onwards
[907.68] will be full of happiness and laughter,
[911.96] there won’t be any sorrow.
[928.40] I was mad,
[930.56] I was mad that I fell in love with you,
[935.36] Aunt even told me such girls 
never change but I,
[942.20] I married you, made you 
the honor of my house.
[948.12] I fulfilled the promise I made to my dad
who was dying and what did you do?
[955.48] You defamed me in the whole society,
[958.36] nothing else.
[963.64] Tell me where did my love fall short
[969.32] that you cheated on me?
[971.00] Afnan, I didn’t cheat you,
[974.92] If I hadn’t promised my Dad,
[977.84] I would have taken you and thrown you 
out of my life right here, right now.
[984.12] I feel disgusted in myself that 
I chose a girl like you.
[997.52] I am telling you not to show me 
your face ever again.
[1000.92] No Afnan, what is wrong with you?
[1002.84] How can you say this, Afnan?
[1004.48] Leave me. 
What is all this that you are saying?
[1006.04] Afnan there is nothing like this, 
Afnan why would I do this?
[1007.88] Ramsha don’t do this.
[1008.96] What you are saying is hurting me, 
Afnan. Afnan I will die…
[1010.52] Die!
[1017.00] If you want to die, then go die.
[1026.88] And after what you have done, 
it will be better if you die.
[1156.72] I couldn’t believe this video 
would get so viral,
[1160.44] the video went viral more than 
I expected.
[1166.44] Yes, Sadaf?
[1168.60] Dude, I have been getting 
so many calls from YouTubers
[1172.00] and channels since morning 
that what should I tell you?
[1174.80] I feel that it might be trending 
on social media.
[1180.16] Yes, you are right,
[1181.64] this video got viral like fire spreads
 in the forest.
[1186.40] Okay I will give you rest of 
the information later.
[1189.32] Okay bye.
[1193.12] I Knew,
[1194.64] I knew that I would find you here.
[1197.48] How are you, Ramsha? 
Come sit.
[1199.68] Hey, sit, tell me what would you like 
to have? Tea or coffee?
[1203.36] By the way, by looking at you I feel 
you need to have something cold.
[1207.44] I feel like drinking 
your blood right now.
[1210.28] Darling, you are getting angry 
for no reason,
[1212.76] you should be grateful to me.
[1223.04] I have heard that Afnan Qasim hid 
this marriage up till now.
[1234.56] It’s good that people found out about 
your marriage with Afnan through me.
[1245.64] Look Ramsha, 
I made your work so easy.
[1249.24] This was my and Afnan’s personal matter,
[1251.56] you didn’t have to interfere in it.
[1254.08] And just because of your cheap fame,
 you ruined my life.
[1258.40] Try to understand, dude.
[1262.32] Forget everything, let’s make a deal,
[1264.64] that will be beneficial for both of us.
[1275.96] You give me some personal details 
about yourself and Afnan,
[1279.60] some videos or pictures, etc,
[1291.48] I will get good money for it that 
we can divide 50-50.
[1307.28] And if anyone asks you anything
[1309.68] you can straight up blame me for 
the entire thing and act innocent yourself.
[1320.04] I would suggest you even cry and 
whine by calling a press conference.
[1333.40] This is all that is happening nowadays, 
Ramsha.
[1335.88] I feel like breaking your face right now.
[1337.84] Do you have any shame 
or grace in you?
[1342.52] You are ruining your life hereafter just
to make your life in this world.
[1347.04] Girls like you are a trial!
[1350.68] Delete all the pictures of myself 
and Afnan right now.
[1358.28] If you didn’t delete them, 
I will file a case against you,
[1362.84] do you understand? 
Delete them.
[1380.96] They have been deleted.
[1384.44] If you ever try to come between 
me and Afnan,
[1389.04] or interfere in our matters,
[1392.24] it won’t be good for you.
[1429.72] Look I know that
[1433.04] what I have done has really 
hurt you but,
[1437.76] but what will we get 
by staying like this?
[1449.92] Give me a chance to talk.
[1462.04] At least listen to me.
[1479.96] What do you want me to hear?
[1492.36] What is left to listen, Afnan?
[1503.80] Should I listen to the stories 
of your love?
[1514.60] Or should I listen to the stories 
of your marriage,
[1516.80] or I guess you want to tell me 
about how helpless were you?
[1531.16] It is an old habit of a man like you to prove
your second marriage to be a compulsion.
[1537.44] I understand your anger, Alizey.
[1551.12] And I even accept that
[1553.60] I made a mistake that 
I didn’t talk to you,
[1566.24] didn’t discuss it with you,
didn’t inform you.
[1569.84] Oh,
[1571.24] you wanted to inform me?
[1582.64] What do you think?
[1584.36] I would have welcomed you 
in this house?
[1586.00] I would have decorated 
this house for you?
[1597.24] I would have accepted your marriage?
[1609.80] Tell me, is that what you think?
[1612.84] No, you wouldn’t have done that.
[1618.20] Afnan, everything was going on,
[1633.40] then what was the need to get married?
[1637.12] You brought that girl to my position
 and made her stand next to me.
[1650.60] You gave her your name,
[1654.16] why did you do all this?
[1662.12] What are you saying?
[1665.92] What is wrong with your thinking?
[1681.40] You know what is the problem
 with women like you?
[1697.12] When your husband is doing 
something unlawful,
[1702.00] it doesn't make any difference to you
[1713.92] but when they lawfully accept 
someone and marry them,
[1718.60] you women have an objection 
on that,
[1733.52] it doesn’t get up to your standards.
[1739.64] What are your standards?
[1751.04] That pathetic girl?
[1759.72] That TikToker who eloped 
from her house?
[1761.56] Enough!
[1768.76] Don’t say a word after that, Alizey,
[1782.48] she is my wife now.
[1786.72] You never got me respected so much,
never took a stand like that for me,
[1796.56] today you are feeling hurt for her?
[1799.00] Afnan, I don’t want to talk to you.
[1819.48] Wait a minute.
[1822.76] Yes, this is wrong.
[1825.96] What?
[1826.96] That you cut the call without
 even looking at it.
[1829.92] What do you think, 
I will doubt you?
[1833.08] No but there has to be a question,
[1836.08] that will you ever doubt me?
[1840.64] To be honest…
[1845.00] Wait a minute.
[1848.16] Why don’t you attend it?
[1849.64] It is not very important to attend the call. 
Leave it.
[1852.36] tell me, will you ever doubt my love?
[1858.44] Umm,
[1859.64] do one thing, you talk on the call, 
and we will talk later.
[1862.44] Hey, no, it is not an important call.
[1865.64] Pick up the call.
[1873.32] Look I know you are feeling 
insecure regarding Ramsha,
[1878.20] but I just want to clears that
[1880.32] we just had temporary friendship 
between us
[1883.60] which is not there anymore, 
it doesn’t exist.
[1886.36] Afnan, I can’t share you with anyone, 
you know it.
[1890.60] And that Ramsha wants to take you
away from me, I know.
[1894.32] I know it very well.
[1896.68] Please, you won’t leave me, 
Afnan, right?
[1898.64] Please don’t leave me, I will get mad 
without you, I ma telling you.
[1902.48] Yes, yes, Alizey, 
I know you love me a lot
[1906.08] but trust me
[1907.48] I love you a lot too I can’t even 
think about anyone except you
[1912.64] and I promise you 
I will never leave you,
[1915.84] please take out this insecurity 
from your heart
[1918.72] there is nothing between me 
and Ramsha, Alizey, nothing.
[1921.92] I am just yours. Just yours.
[1936.84] Hello Afnan.
[1939.28] When I don’t want to talk to you
[1941.84] then why are you continuously 
calling me and bothering me?
[1945.24] If I won’t call you, 
who else will I call, Afnan?
[1947.76] Call those friends of yours
[1955.68] who you have asked to get 
the video viral.
[1960.32] Why don’t you believe me, Afnan?
[1968.84] I haven’t done anything like that,
why will I do all this?
