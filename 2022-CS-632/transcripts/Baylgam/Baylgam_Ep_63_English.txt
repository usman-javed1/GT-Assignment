Greetings. How are you? Greetings, you here? Why? Can I not come here to meet you? And let me know if you don’t like it, 
I will go back. No, no, aunt there is nothing like that, 
come in, please. Let’s go. What happened Ramsha? You don’t look happy seeing 
Aunt Afsheen here? You look worried since 
you have come here. Yes, I am surprised. Why? Annie, I would be surprised, obviously, I don’t understand
if she has come to meet me, by taking out time from her 
important schedule, here, in this area, in this house. And did you see how happily and 
nicely she was talking to me? I don’t understand what is the secret 
behind this now. I don’t know what will happen now. Okay, come, let’s keep this there. yes, come. Hold this. Come. Sister Afsheen, you didn’t take anything,
have something. Thank you so much, 
I actually had food at home. You came so suddenly, had I known it earlier I would have done
better arrangements. Thank you so much, actually, we wanted to come way before but whatever misunderstandings 
happened between Afnan and Ramsha, to be honest, I didn’t have the courage 
to come here because of that. Ramsha, Alizeh is really 
very embarrassed, you know that misunderstandings are
very normal in relationships. Things get escalated and we are unable to understand. After all, human beings make mistakes. You are absolutely right, realizing your mistake is big itself. If you may allow, 
may I take Ramsha with me? Umm. Brother will be very happy to see her. Umm, I don’t mind but 
if you can ask Shani once. Yes, yes, I will talk to Shani, I hope he won’t say no. Have tea at least. You are not ready yet? Aunt, I cannot come with you. Hmm, that means you haven’t forgiven 
Alizeh yet? There is nothing like that, if Alizeh has apologized from heart 
and her heart is clear for me then I forgive her too. obviously, she has realized her mistake that is why she has sent me to you. Okay, do you know Alizeh was coming herself, but she got a sudden meeting 
so she couldn’t, okay now quickly get ready. Not for us but at least for you uncle, he will be very happy seeing you. Umm, thank you so much, I am waiting. Now that she has come here herself and she has never asked for anything 
ever so I can’t say no. So, then you will come 
to pick me up, right? No, not tomorrow, I have to go to 
Hyderabad for a couple of days, I will call you when my work 
gets done there then I will come to pick you up. Okay. uncle, tea. Stay blessed, what have you 
gotten busy into? Hey, Ramsha, you? 
When did you come? Alizeh and Afsheen went to Ramsha’s place
 and brought her along. Aunt and Alizeh? Yes, I don’t know they were planning for so long, 
I didn’t know about it. Dad, are you well? Yes, son, I am well 
by the grace of God. People talk about such weird things
when they get high temperatures. I am absolutely fine and I am not talking weirdly, you can ask Ramsha. I am unable to believe it, the whole world can change but 
Alizeh can never change. okay, so you guys sit and have tea, I will go change. It is very difficult for me to know what is going on in your heart 
and mind. Ramsha? 
Yes? How are you? I am fine, how are you? 
I am fine too. You didn’t go to office? No, I have taken an off from 
office today, I thought since you are here, 
it’s good, that we chit chat and spend 
sometime together. Did you have breakfast? You must have not, you sit I will send the breakfast 
from inside. What are you looking at? I am noticing that Alizeh has
 changed a lot. Yes, I noticed that her attitude 
has changed a lot towards you. Hmm, looks like Alizeh has 
realized her mistake and that’s huge. I pray that is the case. What do you mean? Afnan? Mistrusting someone is a sin, looks like you haven’t forgiven her 
by heart yet. Look Afnan I want to see you 
and Alizeh happy. Trust me I will be very glad
if both of you are happy. Alizeh? I have brought Ramsha here 
as per your request and you are being so frank with her,
what is the reason? What, what are your intentions? Alizeh, why are you standing quietly here like this? For God’s sake, don’t create 
another drama here. Mom, I will just play the game, the crowd will come themselves. Anyway, I am going to my uncle’s room, Ramsha is there too, 
you must come as well, let’s chat. After all, tell me what are you trying 
to do what is your plan? I have made your favorite coffee 
to fix your mood. Here. Come on, forgive me now. Here. Alizeh? Alizeh, dude. You look upset, tell me a way
to fix your mood. Can I be forgiven now? Thank God at least you accepted my apology! Who told you I accepted the apology? Really? But the smile on your face tells 
that you did. Nice poem by the way. Really? Did you google it? Oh, by the way, I have figured out that your wife should never have 
so much information about you. I mean you know I am not interested
in poetry at all but yes, I google the poem 
and it worked. I know it but thank you, they are beautiful. You’re welcome, I was just… Dude, I am getting a very important call, 
one second. Hmm. 
yes, Mr. Ahmed? Mom is absolutely right, if I work less with emotions and 
more using my mind, everything will happen according 
to my choice, what do you think, Ramsha, you will take control of Afnan and 
make him insult me? And will live happily with her 
own husband? And I will let you be happy? Not at all. Hey what happened? 
Where are you lost? Nothing, I was just thinking how much you love me and I never understood you. It’s okay you have realized it today 
and that’s enough. Farmhouse? No, No Alizeh, I cannot go to a farmhouse. I am already not well and you know it and Shani just called and said 
that I should rest, I won’t be able to come. Ramsha why are you reacting like 
you are unwell. This is a natural process, so many women go through it and they stay normal and 
do all the activities too, they go out, meet their friends, 
go shopping and look at you, you are sitting like you are unwell, 
is this the way? yes, but Alizeh, aunt was telling that we should be careful at the time 
of first baby. Listening to you make me feels 
you have a soul from ancient times. What are you even saying? It is my friend’s farmhouse, 
we all will enjoy a lot and trust me, it will be a very good change 
for you too. No, no Alizeh, I know Shani, he will never allow me, I cannot go. Who is asking you to ask Shani? What do you mean? 
I have to inform him. Why do you have to tell Shani? You just told me he has gone
to Hyderabad for two days, we will go to the farmhouse right now 
and come back, what is the need to tell him? No, no Alizeh, I am so sorry, I cannot lie to Shani. Hey what’s there to lie about in this? I am just asking that there is 
no need to tell him anything, we will just go and come back, please come along, it will be so much fun. Look you cannot say no to me. Alizeh, please don’t force, I am honestly telling you that 
I don’t feel like going else I would have definitely 
come with you. Okay, it means that you still haven’t forgiven me that is why you are not coming with me. There is nothing like that I have forgiven you. So then immediately get ready, you are coming with me and 
I don’t want to listen to any excuses. Quickly get ready, 
I will be right back. Alizeh? She is such a stubborn girl, 
what will I tell Shani? Did you talk to Ramsha? yes, I did in the morning, she is fine. Thank God, she will get to spend some days 
peacefully there. It’s good she went there else Shani has really been bothering her,
he gets cranky over everything, it’s good Afsheen came and 
took her with herself. Mom, brother is habitual of all this. Shani’s criticism is not pointless, Whatever Ramsha has done 
in the past is in front of us. But mom, that was her past. You are right, it was her past, but a husband never forgets 
his wife’s bad past that is why they say that girls should 
keep their character so pure that no matter what angle 
do you look at it from, there is not a single stain 
that can be seen. Girls these days, they are uploading pictures on 
social media, on their status, they don’t know this at all that how they themselves are buying 
destruction for their marital life. They don’t realize this and 
their parents doesn’t either, we thank God that those things never
existed in our times and that why the situation of our lives 
are better today, we have been peacefully married
and sitting in our home else these daily fights, doubts, fight and divorces happen 
immediately after marriage, marriages happen again and again,
so does divorces. Obviously, wife loses interest 
in her husband and the husbands doubt their wives. I guess Mom is right. Okay go call Shani from your phone, I have called him a couple of times, 
he is not attending. Oh, okay, okay I will get my phone. What should I do? No, no Alizeh, I am so sorry, I cannot lie to Shani. Hey what’s there to lie about in this? I am just asking that there is 
no need to tell him anything, we will just go and come back 
and he wouldn’t even know. No, no, I should tell Shani before there is a problem,
he must know at least. Ramsha? What happened? 
Who are you calling? Actually Alizeh, 
I was calling Shani. I want to inform him before leaving 
so at least he knows where I am. Actually, you don’t know him 
he has a very short temper. If I go without informing him and he finds out he will get very angry 
and mad at me that is why I am calling him. What happened He is not attending the call. Let me do one thing, uncle and mom are downstairs 
let me tell them, if Shani will call, they will tell him that you are with me, okay? Look, we are getting very late now 
you quickly get ready, leave this phone. Go get ready I will go change too. Brother tea. 
Thank you. Afsheen, where is Ramsha, 
I don’t see her. Brother she has gone to a 
farmhouse with Alizeh. Farmhouse? Yes, actually, a few of Alizeh’s friends 
arranged a get-together there so Alizeh thought of taking 
Ramsha along too. She has gone with so much 
interest with Alizeh. And you know Ramsha doesn’t get
a chance to go to such places. do one thing, bring my phone 
I will talk to Ramsha. Go. No, no brother, there is no point in calling there, Alizeh was saying there are 
no signals at the farmhouse. Why are you worried, 
they will both come soon. Afsheen? You said they will come early, did you see the time? 
Where are they? Brother, that is what Alizeh told me. So call and ask them, how much time will it take 
for them to come back. Brother, I told you there are 
network issue there but I am still trying to contact 
but it is not going through. What is the need to go to such places
where there are such problems, and we are the ones worried, 
look at what time it is. Both are girls and we don’t know 
where they are. Alizeh is calling. 
Attend it. Hello Alizeh, where are you guys it has been so long since
I have been trying to call you. What? Hospital? Hospital? Which hospital? Okay, fine. Okay. What happened Afsheen, tell me? Brother actually, Ramsha… What Ramsha? Brother Ramsha has fallen. 
She is in the hospital. Ramsha fell, hospital? Oh my God. Where? Where is Ramsha? 
How is she? Uncle she is inside, 
doctor is checking her. How did she fell in to the swimming pool and where were you at that time? I don’t understand why did you take her? Uncle I didn’t know this will happen. She just fell into the swimming pool, doctor is checking her they will let us know. Oh God, keep things well. Where is she? In that room. Where is Ramsha? Where is Ramsha? Is she okay? Why don’t you answer me? 
Where is Ramsha? Is she fine? Afnan, she has lost her baby
in this accident. Are you mad? Have you lost your mind? What?
What are you saying? What have you done? When you couldn't take care of her
why did you take her with you? Afnan, what did I know that 
this will happen? You didn’t know? You didn’t know her condition?
She needed extreme care. So Afnan I just took her that 
I will be a change for her, my good deed got me into trouble. Good deed? What is this good deed that 
put someone else in a trial? You should be ashamed, whatever happened with her today, 
you are responsible for it. Lower your tone when you talk to me. 
Why? Why should I talk in a lower tone? Have you seen your behavior? For now, call any of her relatives if you 
have their number and ask them to come here. Call, call that Shani and inform him so he can come 
to the hospital. Okay, okay, don’t tell me what to do. Have patience, Ramsha. Daughter, that was God’s will why do you blame yourself and 
hurt yourself more? Be patient, my child, be patient. No uncle I am unable to have patience. I am unable to have patience,
it’s a huge accident, I am unable to be patient. Oh God, help me. 
I am unable to be patient. God, please give me patience. Look, your aunt is also here, yeah? I am unable to have patience. 
My child, look your aunt. Aunt? Aunt? I have lost my baby. See, see what kind of a mother I am 
I couldn’t take care of my baby, aunt. I am even unable to have patience. Aunt, I am unable to have patience. 
My baby. I am unable to have patience. God has put me through 
this difficult test. Oh God, give me patience.
