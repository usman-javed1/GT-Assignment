[41.20] Yes Madam Ramsha?
[43.56] Tabassum, you didn’t clean 
Uncle’s room today?
[47.60] Whose room, madam Ramsha?
[51.20] Uncle’s room.
[57.72] Both of you listen to me,
[59.80] from today onwards,
[61.32] Uncle’s room will be cleaned 
every day,
[63.20] everything will be placed 
at its place.
[68.08] And brother Bashir you,
[69.84] you will clean everything and 
do the dusting.
[76.32] This room will remain like it was,
[80.24] both of you have to take care of this.
[82.00] Okay, sure. 
Okay, sure.
[109.32] No Afnan,
[111.04] because of him, my brother left me,
I won’t leave her.
[114.32] Aunt, Aunt please. 
Mom.
[115.96] Everyone is watching, 
why are you putting up a show?
[118.08] If it was for me, I would have given her
 to the police.
[121.60] It is my generosity that I am not saying 
anything to her.
[125.32] Afnan, how can you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this house?
[130.08] Tell me. Get her out of this house.
[132.12] Mom. 
Aunt, get back to your senses!
[133.96] You are not providing peace to 
Dad’s soul by doing all this,
[136.68] you are causing him pain instead.
[143.28] What are you doing in 
my Dad’s room?
[146.36] I was missing Uncle, 
so I came here.
[151.28] You miss Dad?
[154.64] Have you forgotten?
[160.88] That if my very much alive Dad 
is no longer in this world,
[164.04] it is because of you.
[167.72] All this has happened because of you,
[171.16] when I look at you,
[174.08] I get blood in my eyes,
[178.40] I feel like that murderer of 
my Dad is standing here.
[182.52] I feel like killing you,
[188.28] give you as much pain as you gave 
to my Dad every moment
[191.88] and send you out of this world,
[195.16] I want to strangle you to death.
[199.40] Okay
[200.68] so then strangle me
[203.08] and kill me so it can end the pain 
for both of us
[207.08] because your words are killing me 
every moment, Afnan,
[210.00] you just kill me once 
so I can be at peace
[212.92] and you can be at peace too, 
kill me,
[216.08] kill me.
[218.76] Afnan,
[222.40] I am handing over Ramsha to you,
[230.36] Have fear of God when it comes 
to that girl,
[238.84] If God forbid something happens to her,
[245.08] I will hold you responsible on 
the day of judgment.
[262.88] You go away from here,
[267.12] go away, I am afraid that
[271.36] I might do something out of anger
[277.08] that might make me regret once again.
[280.76] I wish,
[282.84] I wish you were able to do that
[285.80] but sadly
[288.24] like every time you will be
very late this too.
[345.24] Listen to me,
[348.00] Afnan is not home right now,
[350.88] it is better that you leave 
this home and go,
[359.56] if you won’t go,
[361.48] I will hold your hand and drag you 
out of this house
[373.12] and trust me,
[375.00] no one in this house can stop me.
[378.68] What will you do to get me 
out of this house?
[381.24] I am leaving this house myself,
[382.84] not just because you want me to leave
[385.56] but because I don’t want to live
 in this house.
[388.80] Lower your tome when you talk to me.
[397.60] I guess you are forgetting 
your value in this house.
[401.20] I guess you are forgetting
[403.84] that if I tell the truth 
in front of everyone
[406.84] and I tell everyone your reality
[408.84] then your value in this house 
will be degraded.
[411.92] Ramsha!
[414.92] Control your tongue and your hand
[426.68] else I will forget that you are 
the sister of my guardian.
[430.60] If I am respecting you today 
it is just because of Uncle,
[434.36] else you don’t deserve to be respected.
[463.24] Even after so much has happened, 
this girl’s ego hasn’t broken.
[470.88] How dare she misbehave with you?
[478.12] I won’t spare her. 
Listen,
[480.40] leave it for now.
[486.92] She is already leaving
[488.80] and I don’t want any show 
before she leaves.
[499.08] Oh so you are here, very good.
[502.04] It is good that you are leaving 
this house yourself,
[517.48] else you would have been more humiliated 
had we held your hand and dragged you out.
[530.16] You will be the one getting 
humiliated now
[532.40] and that too very soon.
[551.84] When I will prove you as a culprit,
[554.56] only then the allegation put on me 
will wash away
[556.80] and you guys won’t be able to save 
yourself from the drops of it.
[578.16] I am leaving this house,
[580.16] I am leaving this house, Alizeh
[596.00] but I will definitely come back 
to this house
[598.00] and prove that the trust and 
belief Uncle had on me,
[602.36] I never broke it.
[619.48] The attempt you and your mother 
made to prove me characterless,
[625.12] I will prove it wrong at any cost,
[638.44] and I am not responsible 
for Uncle’s death
[647.48] but both of you are,
I will definitely prove that.
[658.68] That will never happen, Ramsha.
[668.52] That will happen for sure,
[671.00] I have full faith in my God.
[684.08] I don’t know when, how and 
where will he prove it
[698.64] but just wait and watch God will 
definitely prove I am innocent.
[729.56] Ramsha,
[732.24] where are you going?
[734.48] I am leaving this house.
[736.64] Leave it, you are not going anywhere.
[737.92] Afnan. 
You won’t go anywhere.
[739.56] Come back inside. 
Afnan, what is wrong with you?
[741.20] I am telling you to come back inside.
[743.76] Why are you forcing me, Afnan, 
give me my bag here.
[746.36] You are not going anywhere 
from here.
[764.00] Why are you forcing me? 
Why can’t I go?
[766.24] What do you think you will come here 
whenever you want
[769.00] and leave when you want?
[787.40] And I will beg you to stay when 
you will talk about leaving,
[790.68] that please don’t leave my house, 
please.
[807.12] I don’t even expect that 
from you Afnan.
[809.28] That’s great, you shouldn’t!
[825.32] Give me my bag.
[826.20] I am telling you, you are not going 
to go anywhere.
[827.84] Why are you forcing me Afnan?
[829.44] I am forcing you.
[843.16] I am forcing you the same way 
Dad forced me a long time ago,
[847.32] and it is the same forceful promise
[848.88] that Dad made me do that 
I won’t let you go anywhere from here.
[867.64] You cannot prison me in this house 
like prisoners.
[870.40] If you really like to give orders 
then give it to your wife, not me.
[893.64] You won’t step out of here 
without my permission,
[917.48] you will live here,
[919.84] now consider this forcing 
or anything else,
[922.80] this is my final decision.
[932.44] And both of you also listen to me
very carefully,
[946.96] Ramsha will live in this house now,
she will live here,
[954.20] she won’t go anywhere,
[957.52] this is her house too now.
[1018.08] Afnan, what is all this?
[1021.16] if Ramsha wants to leave this house,
then let her go,
[1025.76] why have you disturbed yourself 
and this house because of that girl?
[1038.04] Afnan, can’t you see
[1040.20] that since the day that girl came 
to this house,
[1042.44] nothing is going right?
[1051.88] I suggest that you drag her 
out of this house.
[1060.56] I cannot do this, Aunt,
[1070.16] my hands are tied.
[1083.04] My hands are tied to the promise
[1087.20] Dad made me do before leaving.
[1098.68] He gave me the responsibility that
[1102.92] I will always take care of Ramsha.
[1118.36] You make Alizeh understand,
[1128.20] I cannot break the promise 
I made to Dad.
[1221.60] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1223.40] Sit down.
[1224.08] Sir, you didn’t come to office today?
[1226.56] I waited for you for so long 
at the office,
[1229.20] actually, your signature was very much 
needed on this file,
[1232.04] that is why the manager sent me
 to your home.
[1235.40] Give it to me.
[1266.96] Sir, are you well?
[1270.32] Yes, I am, why?
[1271.84] Sir, you never sign the documents 
without reading, that is why I am asking.
[1276.52] You signed without reading today.
[1280.44] Whatever I do is not your problem,
[1282.80] mind your own business.
[1284.48] Okay sir.
[1287.08] Listen?
[1288.44] Yes, sir?
[1293.24] Are you married?
[1295.48] Umm, No sir.
[1299.40] Why?
[1300.72] Sir, you know my income and 
the inflation nowadays,
[1308.72] my own survival becomes 
very difficult in it,
[1312.88] Sir not just the boy’s family
[1314.80] but the girl’s family’s demands have 
also increased a lot these days.
[1326.84] Now in this situation
[1328.24] who will marry someone with 
an ordinary job.
[1336.68] If I tell you there is this girl that 
I can get you married to,
[1346.32] will you marry her?
[1348.12] What sir?
[1353.48] I want you to marry Ramsha.
[1357.32] What?
[1358.60] Madam Ramsha?
[1360.40] The one whom sir made his daughter.
[1365.52] Yes, her.
[1406.00] Afnan, take food, 
it is getting cold.
[1419.20] Afnan?
[1429.84] The food is getting cold, have it.
[1439.92] What is it?
[1441.36] You look worried to me.
[1447.64] You can share with me 
if there is anything.
[1451.92] No, there is nothing.
[1456.40] Hey?
[1463.52] What is it?
[1465.60] Afnan looks worried to me,
[1467.88] I have noticed he is always thinking 
something,
[1471.12] I am sure that he must have discussed
something with you.
[1474.96] No, mom, If I would know 
I would have definitely told you.
[1479.00] What kind of a wife are you, Alizeh?
[1481.40] You don’t know anything 
what your husband is thinking,
[1484.32] what is going on in his heart? 
Why is he worried,
[1487.48] show some interest.
[1491.08] So what should I do mom?
[1493.04] If Afnan doesn’t want to share 
anything with me,
[1495.32] what is my fault in it?
[1496.92] Why are you blaming me for it?
[1498.56] Because you are his wife
[1500.32] and still you guys have so much 
distances in between,
[1502.68] because you never took interest,
[1504.76] you just care about your career, 
your lifestyle,
[1507.08] you just focus on yourself.
[1509.32] Have you ever focused 
on your husband?
[1511.28] Because you don’t care.
[1514.44] Why do you drag my career 
in everything?
[1518.16] If he doesn’t want to share it 
with me, what can I do?
[1520.72] You tell me?
[1523.52] At least let me eat in peace.
[1526.76] In fact, just forget it.
[1548.68] Umm,
[1550.76] Ramsha I have spoken 
to Adeel in detail.
[1555.84] He is ready to marry you.
[1566.76] And don’t worry,
[1568.56] I have investigated completely 
about him,
[1578.72] he is a very noble boy,
[1580.56] he does not have any bad habits.
[1589.56] You will be very happy 
if you marry him.
[1594.00] Who gave you the right to 
take my life decisions?
[1605.16] How can you even think 
I will do as you say?
[1610.64] I am not doing all this myself, Ramsha,
[1620.24] my dad who was dying, 
give your responsibility to me.
[1623.48] Enough Afnan, I am tired of hearing
this from you,
[1630.64] Afnan, from now on I am setting 
you free from my responsibility,
[1634.72] For God’s sake, you set me free too.
[1638.92] I should set you free?
[1641.04] You?
[1643.68] Who doesn’t even know 
how to use her freedom,
[1646.00] who always misuses her freedom?
[1650.60] Listen Afnan,
[1652.84] stop interfering in my life matters.
[1660.96] Let me live my life by my choice,
[1663.56] I would be very grateful to you.
[1666.36] I don’t like interfering in 
your life matters,
[1670.40] but you don’t even know
 how to live your life, Ramsha,
[1674.56] when do you even know 
how to take right decision,
[1678.24] had you taken right decisions,
[1681.68] my dad would have been 
alive today.
[1685.44] You killed my father.
[1688.84] Had you properly lived your life,
[1691.40] you wouldn’t be here 
but at your own home.
[1694.40] My Dad would have been alive today
[1697.88] and I wouldn’t have so much hate 
for you today.
[1704.88] Oh God, hope everything is right.
[1708.36] Mom?
[1710.00] What was this noise?
[1712.32] I don’t know, something broke.
[1714.20] Come let’s check.
[1725.00] You have put me and yourself,
[1727.76] both of us in a test,
[1730.24] all of this wouldn’t have happened today.
[1734.76] Ramsha?
[1736.04] Ramsha?
[1737.76] Ramsha, listen to me, stop.
[1741.88] I am taking the guarantee of that boy,
[1744.08] what is the problem then?
[1745.60] And look if you don’t want 
to marry Adeel,
[1748.28] and you have someone else that 
you like then answer me.
[1763.20] Why are you standing here 
like a statue, answer me.
[1773.80] Afnan is asking you something, answer.
[1790.92] Alizeh, take her away from here, 
Afnan will keep on getting angrier
[1794.12] if she keeps on standing here. 
Take her away.
[1810.72] Come, Ramsha.
[1847.56] Ramsha, if you live in 
this house anymore,
[1849.92] we all will go mad.
[1858.32] You have made Mom a blood pressure
patient already,
[1866.64] and Afnan,
[1867.72] he is getting unwell because of you 
day by day.
[1877.60] What do you want from all of us, 
after all?
[1888.44] For God’s sake,
 stop crying.
[1900.28] You are so stubborn.
[1901.92] Uncle left the world because of you.
[1912.24] What do you want?
[1913.52] We all should die 
because of you as well?
[1924.36] You don’t care at all.
[1937.24] You are such a selfish girl.
[2045.28] Listen?
[2049.08] I want to talk to you.
[2051.76] Say it.
[2054.28] I am ready to listen to you
[2058.04] but I have one condition.
[2065.40] For a moment I thought you are 
concerned that I am worried,
[2078.76] that is why you are listening to me.
[2092.12] It’s good
[2095.16] that you cleared my misunderstanding
in a few moments.
[2108.36] Aunt is right,
[2116.48] for girls like you,
[2119.36] relationships don’t matter
[2122.44] but conditions are important,
[2136.00] anyway,
[2137.88] what do you need now? 
Tell me about your condition.
[2146.80] You will never interfere in my life
after I leave this house.
[2163.68] After my marriage,
[2165.84] the commitment you made 
to Uncle will be fulfilled,
[2186.24] you will have to promise me, Afnan.
[2200.76] No matter whatever happens,
[2202.72] whatever happens,
[2204.20] whether I live or die, no matter 
what situation I am in,
[2218.68] you will never see my face
[2222.28] and will never show me your face.
[2240.72] If you agree to all this,
[2244.16] I will also agree to what you said.
[2259.92] I am ready to get married.
[2303.32] When do you even know 
how to take right decision,
[2307.12] had you taken right decisions,
[2310.40] my dad would have been alive today.
[2314.36] You killed my father.
[2317.76] Had you properly lived your life,
[2320.36] you wouldn’t be here 
but at your own home.
[2323.32] My Dad would have been alive today
[2326.80] and I wouldn’t have so much hate 
for you today.
