The day Ramsha has left this home 
and your life, happiness has left this home. At times, I am made to believe that we have really hurt Ramsha. Annie, what are you saying? Ramsha was a really good girl. She had changed herself 
for the will of God. She became sincere to you, 
she started loving you, but you didn’t care for her. This world is filled with karma, brother. Shameless, disgracefully, shameful. What is wrong, Shani? Talk with respect. What are you so angry about? What am I angry about? I am angry that I am not shameless 
like you. Do you understand? What is all this? 
What is he saying, tell me. Tell me the truth, 
what is the matter? Mama, what are you asking her? Ask me if you want to know the truth. I will tell you if you have the courage. I will kill her right now. 
Shani. Papa, leave me. 
I am in my senses. I am in my senses. But now all of you will see
 what I do to her. Come with me. 
I don’t want to go… Come with me. 
I will not leave you. Listen to me. Are you in your senses, Shani? Does anyone treat their wife like this? Whose wife? Mine, right? So I don’t understand why do you 
sympathize with her so much? She is my wife I will do what I want. If she is your wife, 
then consider her your wife. Don’t treat her like an animal. If she doesn’t listen to you,
 then talk to her with love. Locking her in the room 
in not the right treatment. God forbid, had something 
happened to her, then? Yes, so what? At max, she would have died. Everyone has to die. You people are not listening 
to me Listen… Stop it. Not a word. No one will listen to her here. I will not tolerate you in my life
for a moment, and I… Shani listen to me. Ramsha, I divorce you. I divorce you. I divorce you. Afnan, I was coming to talk to you. You don’t need to do anything 
for me, Afnan. No home, neither any flat, 
nor anything else. I don’t want anything at all. After all, I have gotten used to 
going through pain, but I don’t have any further courage
to lift the burden of someone’s favour, so have mercy on me and 
don’t any favour on me. Are you done or do you want 
to say something more too? Look, Adeel’s parents are coming 
tomorrow for your wedding. The Qazi will reach till the evening, the remaining arrangement has 
also been made. Alizay will dress you up. And I hope that you will not do anything tomorrow that will embarrass me. Whose dress is this? Ramsha’s dress has come 
from her In-laws. This has come from her in-laws? The dress is so cheap. What do you think they will send 
some expensive dress? After all, it is her second marriage and this is how weddings take place 
when you get married for the second time. Shehnaz. Shehnaz. Yes, madam? Take these clothes and 
give them to Ramsha. Yes, sure. It was really bad. Bano, you? At this time? 
What are you doing here? Brother Bashir, 
is Mr. Afnan at home? I want to talk to him about 
something important. Tell him that Tabassum has come. Mr. Afnan is not at home right now. What? He is not here? Till when will he come? I don’t know that. He comes by this time daily. Today is madam Ramsha’s wedding, I think he is busy in that. What? Madam Ramsha is 
getting married? So soon? Yes, poor madam Ramsha 
has such fate. The person has an ordinary job, 
he is marrying her to him. After sir left, madam Ramsha 
became a burden for everyone. Now they had to get rid of this burden
off their head. Poor madam Ramsha. Right now madam Afsheen and 
Alizay are at home, if you want then should I call them? No, no, no need to tell anyone I came. I am just going. This wedding cannot take place. Mr. Qazi, why are you sitting here? Now this wedding wont happen.
 These people wasted our time, you don’t waste your time,
go to some other wedding, come on Nabeel. Aunty. Aunty. Aunty, no. Aunty. 
Come on. Aunty, no. Aunty, I beg you. Please don’t end this proposal. 
Aunty, I will do what you tell me to. I will listen to everything you say. I will not say no to anything. I am ready to live like a maid 
in your home too. I will not make any wish.
 I will do what you tell me to. But aunty please don’t end 
this proposal. Please aunty, I beg you. In fact, I am falling to your feet. Aunty please don’t end this proposal. You people are not listening 
to me Listen… Stop it. Not a word. No one will listen to her here. I will not tolerate you in my life
 for a moment, and I… Shani listen to me. Ramsha, I divorce you. I divorce you. I divorce you. Ramsha. What is this? You are still not ready, nor have you
changed your clothes. Why are you sitting here 
like a sick face? What will your in-laws think 
when they see you? Those people must be on their way. At least get ready quickly. Ramsha, please get ready. Weird. I am not interested in knowing 
about your life. But when do you know 
how to live your life? When do you know how to 
take right decisions? If you had taken right decisions, then my father would have been 
alive today. You killed my father. Had you lived your life properly, then today, you wouldn’t be here,
you would have been at your own home. My father would have been alive today. And I wouldn’t hate you so much today. Mr. Afnan. Mr. Afnan, I want to talk to you about 
something important. Hey, what happened? 
Why are you so worried? Actually, you would remember, 
I wanted to tell you something. Fine, come inside and tell me. 
No sir Afnan. Actually, madam Afsheen has fired me. Why did she fire you? Actually, she was afraid that 
I might tell you the reality. Tabassum, what are you saying?
Tell me clearly. Look at this. Don’t you remember how much money
I spent to get her kidnapped. We took such a big risk. Mama, I feel that all our hard work
 will go to waste. All that you did will go to waste. You are still not ready? I... When did you come? I just came. Where has Adeel’s family reached? It is time, why have they still not come? They are not coming. What? I mean, the weather is really bad today. Maybe those people wont be 
able to come, so I will have to take Ramsha there. This means her wedding wont 
take place today? The wedding will take place today. Ramsha will get married today. Only those people wont come, so I am telling you I will take her.
I will manage. Afnan, then you do one thing, 
take out the car. I will help her get ready and bring her. Come on, please Ramsha, get up. Ramsha, please get up. This rain will not going to stop. I think we should go inside 
without waiting further. Let’s go inside and see. Come in. Hey, come on.
Why are you standing there? Come. Whose home is this? Hey, I just told you. This is my apartment too. 
So you don’t need to afraid. So why is it empty? You had said everyone is waiting for us. Yes, I had said it, but those people 
are not coming. Ramsha, this is wanted to tell that you, actually I… What Afnan? Ramsha, listen to me. Afnan, what do you think of me? How did you even think this, Afnan. Ramsha, you are taking me wrong, I… What is wrong with you? 
How can you think this? Ramsha. Ramsha, listen to me. Ramsha, listen to me. Come inside. I don’t want to go. I told you, come inside. I told you, I will not go inside! You won’t agree like this. Fine, kill me, but I will not marry you. I cannot take your life 
even if I want to. But if today you don’t agree, then I will surely take my life. I… Now tell me, what is your answer? Either you will see me dying
in front of your eyes today, or today we will become one. Tell me, should I kill myself? Fine, you won’t speak like this. I will only count till three Ramsha. After that my dead body will be
in front of you. One. Two… I am ready. Mama, did you talk to Afnan? 
Did he call? Why? What happened? I have been calling him for so long, he is not answering my call.
I don’t know where he is. You know the traffic, the poor thing must be stuck somewhere.
He must be on his way. Don’t worry. Afnan, wait, where are you going? To look for Ramsha. It is raining so much outside, 
how can you go out in this weather? Hey, what is wrong with you? Ramsha is missing for so long. 
Move out of my way, I will find her. Afnan, listen to me. 
Afnan, listen to me. What is it? I will not let you go out in this weather. Have you lost your mind? Why don’t you understand what I am saying? Don’t come in my way now. I have to find Ramsha at all cost right now, because right now my heart and 
mind are not in my control, please don’t come in my way. 
Afnan… What happened? Is Afnan back? No mama, he is not even
 answering my call. I don’t know what this is. Hey, so he must be stuck in traffic, 
he must be on his way. I am really angry at him. Hey, what is there to be angry in this?
You should be happy Alizay. You have gotten rid of the problem 
like Ramsha. Thank God. Had her wedding stopped, then it would have been really difficult 
to get rid of her. Yes, you are right about that. We have got rid of that girl 
with difficulty. But you also see the way Afnan humiliated 
and sent that girl away. I don’t think she will ever come back 
to this home.
