[28.32] I don’t love you.
[29.76] Should I forcefully say that 
I love you? Leave it.
[33.20] After today, you and I will not have 
a relation with each other.
[36.28] I made a mistake that 
I helped you.
[38.68] It is all my fault.
[41.20] This is it. I am sorry,
[43.36] I cannot live with this burden,
[45.08] that’s why I am going.
[46.08] Look Afnan, don’t do this.
[47.84] Look, I love you and I have told mama
that I have come to meet you.
[51.76] I want to marry you. I love you, 
you love me.
[54.92] Just shut up.
[57.32] Hey, you said all this to your mother,
then it is not my fault.
[60.84] But I never told you that 
I love that I will marry you.
[66.68] I am telling you,
[67.96] after today, whatever relation you 
and I had is over.
[74.96] What do you think that
[76.84] I am not marrying you because 
I am busy with my work?
[81.12] Yes.
[82.04] Have you gone mad?
[85.04] Have you lost your mind?
[87.84] How did you even think 
that I will marry you?
[91.20] It is my fault.
[92.68] It is my fault, I shouldn’t have 
befriended you.
[94.92] But I had lost my mind.
[96.92] I thought she is an innocent girl, 
she gets herself in trouble,
[99.52] fine I will help her, but you…
[102.44] you are after my life.
[113.64] Hey, you had left your parents 
and come.
[118.00] You didn’t care about their respect,
[120.56] so how will you care for my respect?
[125.68] The one who couldn’t be true 
to her parents,
[128.52] she cannot be true to me either.
[131.16] You have no idea about the importance 
of relations, Ramsha.
[135.12] If you care for something it is you,
 yourself and your happiness.
[144.40] I don’t want to argue with you 
on anything.
[147.76] You can leave from here.
[149.20] I will not go.
[151.44] You will go.
[153.12] Not just from this room,
 but also from this home.
[156.00] Look…
[157.52] look Ramsha, already a lot of drama 
has happened between me and you.
[160.72] Right now everyone is sleeping,
[162.60] it is a good opportunity, 
leave from here quietly,
[164.64] no scene will be created.
[173.68] Once more…
[177.24] once more my guess about 
you turned out to be wrong.
[182.16] You know seeing this getup of yours,
for a moment,
[186.16] I thought you have changed, but no,
[189.80] you are the same person today.
[192.88] The same stubborn person who 
doesn’t listen to things easily.
[197.48] Yes, that’s how it is.
[201.60] I have changed.
[205.00] So it would be better that 
you leave from here.
[210.24] No need to say anything.
[212.76] Do as I say.
[214.92] Pack your bags, then go to dad,
[217.60] and tell him that you don’t want 
to live here. You will go to your home.
[221.12] Come on, give me the address 
for your home.
[227.16] What can liars and hypocrites like you
do apart from this.
[231.76] that’s it,
[233.92] you have spoken enough.
[237.80] These people are not making up 
these stories, you are.
[241.76] You are telling a false story 
like always.
[245.40] What was the need for you 
to do all this, Ramsha?
[249.64] I have had enough. There is 
no room for you in this home,
[251.28] get lost from here.
[259.36] If my father is not in this world,
then it is only cause of you.
[266.12] All this happened cause of you.
[269.84] When I see you,
[272.68] I get blood in my eyes.
[276.92] I feel that my father’s murderer
is standing.
[281.00] I want to kill you.
[286.84] I torture you the same way you 
tortured my father every moment
[290.52] and sent him from this world.
[293.64] I want to choke you to death.
[299.20] Mr. Afnan,
[301.56] stop interfering in the matters of my life.
[304.92] Let me live my life by my will.
[307.28] This will be a big favor you will do on me.
[310.24] I have no interest in interfering 
in the matters of your life.
[313.96] But when do you know 
how to live your life?
[318.40] When do you know how 
to take right decisions?
[321.96] If you had taken right decisions,
[325.44] then my father would have been
 alive today.
[329.20] You killed my father.
[332.48] Hey, had you lived your life properly,
[335.32] then today, you wouldn’t have been here, 
you would have been at your home.
[338.08] My father would have been alive today
[341.56] and I wouldn’t have hated you 
so much today.
[349.64] What is happening to me?
[353.36] I just wanted that I don’t see 
Ramsha’s face again.
[359.52] Why is my heart so restless now?
[373.16] Did you talk to your parents?
[375.36] Yes, sir, I spoke to my parents.
[377.56] They will come when you want 
to meet them.
[379.44] They live in Hyderabad.
[382.76] hmm..
[384.12] and where do you live?
[385.52] Sir, you know this city is 
really expensive,
[387.56] and I shifted here some time back.
[390.08] Sir, I live here in Mehmoodabad. 
I share a flat with a friend of mine.
[395.88] Then where will Ramsha stay? 
Where will you keep her?
[398.76] Sir, I don’t have this much 
range right now,
[406.24] but still I will try that I get a 
small flat in this area.
[413.68] I am making your salary double
[420.64] and along with that I am getting you
an apartment as well.
[430.44] The apartment will be your own,
[432.92] you will have no worry
[436.04] and you will be able to spend 
the rent money somewhere else.
[440.16] Thank you so much, sir. 
Thank you.
[442.12] and you call your parents.
[445.32] Call them tomorrow, 
so that we can talk to them.
[449.16] Thank you sir, 
I will call them today.
[451.36] They will come to meet you.
[454.20] Look,
[455.52] I have told you everything 
about Ramsha.
[459.44] You also know she is divorced.
[461.60] Yes.
[463.24] I hope you have no objection on this.
[466.00] No sir, I have no objection on this.
[473.44] Everyone knows Mr. Qasim has 
made her, her daughter.
[483.08] Her joining with my fate will be 
something of pride for me.
[507.20] This girl should leave from this home 
today, instead of tomorrow.
[514.40] I just want that
[516.68] the war between you and 
Afnan should end.
[522.28] I don’t know what magic 
this girl has.
[534.80] The more you try to distance her 
from this home,
[537.04] she gets an even stronger footing.
[540.36] That’s what we have to think 
about now.
[543.00] What do you have to think? 
Who do you have to think about aunt?
[545.68] I was saying that
[548.76] obviously I am a mother, 
I am the elder,
[550.80] so I worry for my daughters.
[553.16] I was actually worried for Ramsha.
[556.00] I was taking about her, to her.
[558.80] If daughters go to their home,
[561.32] then my heart too will be at peace.
[564.12] Yes aunt, you are absolutely right.
[567.36] I have a boy in my office, Adeel.
[570.04] He is good, educated and decent.
[572.88] The issue is that he is from 
lower middle class,
[576.52] he lives in a rented apartment, 
so I am thinking about that.
[591.56] Why delay something good, Afnan?
[596.96] Aunt, his financial condition
 is not that good,
[600.04] we will have to do something.
[617.56] Afnan, you are doing so much 
for her already.
[634.92] After all, Ramsha belongs 
to a middle class family.
[660.92] Her exposure increased so much 
because of uncle and us.
[664.04] Alizay, maybe you are forgetting, 
if dad was alive today,
[668.52] he would have done much 
more than this for her.
[674.24] That is why it is my responsibility too.
[732.72] Listen to me.
[734.20] This is not your father’s car
[736.64] that you go around in this.
[739.36] The car belongs to you people,
[742.48] I just went to the academy.
[744.88] Don’t act so innocent.
[747.60] If brother has given you a place 
in this home out of sympathy,
[751.28] then this in no way means 
you are a family member.
[755.64] And these cars are for 
the family members,
[759.60] not for every other person.
[764.72] Uncle told me to go to the academy 
with the driver,
[769.96] that’s why I went with the driver.
[772.16] Hey even if brother has said it 
to you even as a formality
[775.20] then it doesn’t mean that you agree 
to everything he says.
[778.68] Have some shame, 
a person also says no.
[782.16] You are not a child that 
we tell you everything.
[785.12] Be careful in future.
[792.28] I had to go to the academy, 
I just went and checked,
[795.20] no driver is there.
[797.08] So, will you call that the driver comes.
[799.96] Ramsha,
[801.32] do you have a time for going 
to the academy
[804.04] or do you go to the academy 
at any time?
[806.68] The servants of the home are 
the servants of this home
[809.40] and not your personal assistants.
[812.92] Actually, there is a special lecture
[815.84] that is why I am going to the academy 
at this time, or else…
[819.16] Anyway, there is no driver,
[820.64] if you want to go, 
then you can go in a rickshaw
[824.72] and if you don’t have the money for 
the fare, then I will give it to you.
[834.00] Did you come on a bike?
[837.12] Yes.
[840.52] Then you should have asked 
your husband,
[842.12] at least he should have brought you 
in a taxi.
[845.24] Now see, you must have gotten used 
to traveling in big cars staying in this home.
[850.76] It would have been so difficult for you 
to come on a bike,
[854.56] you must be out of the habit too.
[860.36] Now just things that are of use for you,
[862.80] just because you are getting things for free, 
it doesn’t mean you get what you want.
[867.36] I had said no to uncle, 
he sent me with you forcefully.
[870.28] Yes, you are really naïve, 
he told you and you came.
[873.60] Right?
[874.44] I can see the way you are robbing 
my brother.
[879.80] Why did you stop?
[882.28] Stop these dramas, 
stop this crying.
[886.32] I don’t want to get anything, 
I want to go home. Come on.
[888.88] When you didn’t have to get anything,
then why did you bring me here?
[891.84] Stop these dramas of yours.
[893.56] If you go emptyhanded like this,
[895.16] then brother will feel that I have 
stopped you for getting anything.
[899.12] Get the things you need 
and come home.
[901.60] I don’t have time for these dramas 
of yours.
[980.84] Aunt.
[983.88] Go ahead.
[984.96] keep this credit card.
[990.76] Uncle gave it to me
[997.64] saying that if I ever need 
anything I can use it.
[1003.00] Wow,
[1004.52] brother even gave you credit cards.
[1013.00] But he never mentioned it to me.
[1024.12] Now you tell me,
[1025.72] what other things did 
he bless you with?
[1037.08] You know, you are really smart.
[1039.08] You have brought 
the credit card to me,
[1041.16] because it is out of balance.
[1043.16] You would want that 
I put balance in it.
[1050.20] But neither would I put balance in it, 
nor Afnan,
[1053.56] because I am not brother.
[1056.36] I don’t want anything like that.
[1058.08] I don’t need balance in this.
[1066.20] In fact, it still has the balance it had.
[1075.28] I didn’t use it even once,
[1077.64] you can get it checked if you want.
[1080.68] You are not doing me a favour 
returning it.
[1091.00] You must not need it anyway,
[1093.52] because all of your wishes and desires
were being fulfilled in this home,
[1105.96] so there is no point of keeping this.
[1110.84] I needed uncle.
[1118.56] Not this money.
[1121.76] You keep it, maybe you will need it.
[1134.56] Ill-mannered girl,
[1135.96] I don’t know what she thinks of herself.
[1185.80] What? Credit card?
[1189.32] This means uncle must have 
given Ramsha a lot.
[1193.16] Mama you find out from her.
[1196.16] You are absolutely right.
[1198.84] When brother can give her 
credit cards,
[1201.12] then he must have surely kept 
his precious things with her.
[1211.52] You know, brother had a lot.
[1222.76] When sister in law,
passed away,
[1224.76] there was a lot of jewelry 
of sister in law.
[1227.84] But till today no one found out 
where it went.
[1237.84] And even when you got married, 
brother didn’t give you a single set.
[1249.40] I feel he kept all of this with Ramsha.
[1253.28] You are absolutely right.
[1254.88] First uncle spent his wealth on her,
[1257.12] and now even Afnan is ready 
to spend it.
[1260.04] You know what he was saying to me?
[1263.08] He is talking about giving her 
a flat on the wedding.
[1265.76] What?
Yes.
[1268.32] Has Afnan lost his mind.
[1275.68] I am surprised that even 
after so much happened,
[1279.88] Afnan is giving this girl so much 
respect and a flat too.
[1283.00] This is the limit. She is not single.
[1286.12] He should marry her with simplicity
and send her off.
[1289.24] That’s what I am trying to 
make him understand,
[1291.36] but when does he listen to me.
[1293.00] Alizay, the amount of effort we put in 
to drag this girl out of this home,
[1297.56] I feel all that effort went to waste.
[1304.08] You are right, mama.
[1306.16] Now was it easy to defame Ramsha?
[1313.48] We put so much effort 
in making her look bad.
[1317.96] Don’t you remember how much money 
I spent to get her kidnapped.
[1321.52] We took such a big risk.
[1324.16] Mama, I feel that all our hard work 
will go to waste.
[1327.44] All that you did will go to waste.
[1342.68] Mama,
[1344.08] I feel that someone was there.
[1348.84] No one is there.
[1358.28] No Alizay, no one is there.
[1360.56] Did Afnan hear us talk.
[1363.64] No Alizay, I just saw, 
Afnan is in his room.
[1366.48] He is doing his office work.
No, I will still go and see.
[1403.64] Come in.
[1413.20] Sir Afnan.
Yes?
[1415.00] I wanted to talk to you about 
something important.
[1417.76] go ahead
I…
[1419.68] Afnan,
[1421.16] aunt Safia has called twice since morning,
[1424.84] you please talk to her.
[1428.16] Fine, I will do it.
[1429.64] You tell me, what is the matter?
[1439.04] Mr. Afnan, nothing.
[1441.64] Nothing.
[1448.28] What do you mean?
[1449.44] You were just saying you wanted to 
talk about something important?
[1452.32] Yes, I wanted an off.
[1468.64] That’s all I wanted to talk about.
[1472.40] How many days do you want off?
[1474.56] One day.
[1482.32] Fine, come back after one day.
 Leave.
[1484.76] Fine.
[1536.36] Tabssum, listen to me?
[1539.28] What was the important thing 
you wanted to talk to Afnan about?
[1543.84] I…
[1545.36] I wanted an off.
[1548.76] So you could have talked to mama 
or me about this.
[1557.40] When have you asked Afnan
for an off earlier?
[1560.92] I…
[1562.68] I was cleaning downstairs
[1564.80] so Mr. Afnan was sitting there,
[1566.68] so I spoke him about an off.
[1572.76] Okay.
[1579.04] Fine. Leave.
[1659.44] I will drag you out of the home, 
in front of the neighbours.
[1661.80] You want this so I will do it.
[1663.76] Why are you so merciless?
[1667.84] If I don’t come to this home, 
where will I go?
[1670.24] This is my home.
[1672.68] You are my husband, 
I am your wife.
[1675.92] You are dragging me out of my home.
[1678.96] Look Shani,
[1680.16] after so much happened, 
I still came back to this home,
[1683.28] just for you.
[1685.80] So that I can live my life with you.
[1688.08] If you distance me from yourself,
then I will die…
[1690.32] Don’t drive me mad.
I am telling you,
[1692.68] you are making me so mad
[1695.00] that I say something that you will not
be able to come to this home again.
[1702.48] You don’t understand?
Get out of here.
[1704.12] She is leaving. 
don’t say anything, please.
[1707.40] Ramsha, come on. 
Come on, please.
[1722.12] Have you forgotten your past?
[1729.92] I knew it.
[1731.44] I had an idea about 
you being a lowlife.
[1733.92] Yes, I am lowlife. 
You recognized me well.
[1737.36] And after marriage you will understand 
that I am not just a lowlife,
[1741.28] but I am really cheap too.
[1742.96] Because I remember every single thing.
[1747.28] And I will take revenge for 
everything one by one.
[1763.40] Your wedding gift.
[1774.24] This is your wedding gift.
[1795.32] I took you to the restaurant,
I fed you,
[1797.64] I took you for an outing and you cannot
do something so small for me.
[1802.44] It is simple,
[1803.68] you will go their home tomorrow 
and bring money, okay?
[1807.56] You have gone completely mad.
[1809.16] Neither will I go to him, 
nor will I ask him for money,
[1812.44] so you do what you want. This…
[1815.36] Ramsha, I am telling you,
you are making me angry
[1818.16] and you know how dangerous I am 
when I am angry.
[1821.56] Shani, it hurts me and
you can do what you want,
[1823.96] I will not be scared of threats.
Are you mad? Shani.
[1827.64] Go inside.
What are you doing Shani?
[1829.72] Have you gone mad? 
Open the door. Aunt. Aunt.
[1839.52] Shani,
[1842.04] son,
[1844.16] did you find out something? 
Did you make arrangements for money?
[1850.52] No,
[1854.48] I got a no from the place I spoke at
[1857.88] and papa has spoken at one 
or two places,
[1861.16] but we don’t have a lot of hope 
from their either.
[1865.20] Yes, obviously,
[1868.96] there is so much inflation, 
who will give us a loan.
[1873.60] People survive themselves, 
that is a big blessing.
[1878.84] We are almost out of groceries,
[1880.68] we will survive how we can.
[1883.48] It is just a matter of a few days.
[1885.72] But I am worried,
[1889.32] I don’t understand what I am should do.
[1894.20] Okay, I will bring food.
[1905.48] I have never seen such bad times 
ever in my life.
[1910.08] This has never happened in life.
[1912.08] I don’t know, I am surrounded 
by worried all around,
[1918.28] something weird is happening.
I don’t know what I have done.
[1926.24] Brother, I want to say something.
[1928.32] I hope you wont mind.
[1938.52] The day Ramsha has left this home
and your life,
[1943.00] happiness has left this home.
[1955.24] At times, I am made to believe that
[1959.60] we have really hurt Ramsha.
[1963.20] Annie, what are you saying?
[1966.04] That’s how it is.
[1975.96] Ramsha was a really good girl.
[1984.48] She had changed herself 
for the will of God.
[1995.16] She became sincere to you,
she started loving you,
[2004.48] but you didn’t care for her.
[2015.96] This world is filled with karma, brother.
[2023.96] If you get time, 
then do think about this.
[2094.04] Madam Ramsha.
[2094.96] What is wrong? Have you gone mad?
You scared me.
[2097.24] Madam Ramsha, 
I had to tell you something.
[2101.20] If you had to talk to me, then you should
have come to my room properly,
[2103.88] what was the need to come to my room 
so secretly? Tell me, what happened?
[2107.16] Actually…
Tabassum.
[2110.00] Tabassum…
[2111.60] Madam is calling you.
[2114.12] Why?
[2121.00] I don’t know that, but madam has said
that you come with me.
[2130.52] Okay you go ahead,
I am coming.
[2132.20] No madam said that you come with me.
Come on.
[2166.32] Madam, you called me.
[2168.72] Tabassum, you were asking 
for an off, right?
[2170.76] I thought I would send you 
on a long leave.
[2174.52] I don’t understand.
[2177.76] There are a lot of servants in this home.
[2180.12] And after all, after brother’s departure,
[2182.52] there is not a lot of work.
[2194.88] It is better that you find another job
for yourself.
[2199.40] What are you saying, madam?
[2213.16] I have worked at your place
for a long time,
[2215.28] if I have made a mistake, 
then forgive me.
[2222.80] This is your salary.
[2225.88] Right now the month is not complete,
[2227.84] there are still ten days to go, 
still I am giving you the full salary.
[2231.16] But madam where will I get 
a job so soon?
[2239.40] This is not my issue.
[2245.64] I have not taken up your responsibility 
that I solve all your problems.
[2249.72] Now go from here.
[2260.32] And I know well how much 
you work here.
[2264.20] What are you saying, madam?
[2266.04] You think I don’t know all the things 
you have taken without my permission,
[2281.32] but I know everything.
[2282.84] It is my goodness that I didn’t say 
anything to you till today.
[2286.20] Madam, all this is a lie,
[2287.80] I have worked here really honestly.
[2301.88] And I never took anything 
without your permission.
[2305.28] Don’t argue with me.
[2311.92] If I even see you near this home now,
[2314.88] I will hand you over to the police.
[2327.48] Now go from here.
[2356.00] Thank God, mama.
[2357.56] You handled this situation really well.
[2362.16] Now, not just Ramsha,
[2364.20] she will not even come 
close to this home.
[2366.56] Thank God.
