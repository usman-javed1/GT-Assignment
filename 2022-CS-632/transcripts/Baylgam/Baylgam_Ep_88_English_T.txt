[19.96] What are you doing, Afnan?
[21.64] Should I open my eyes? This..
[28.00] How do you like it?
[31.36] What was the need for this, Afnan?
[33.20] Why was there no need for this?
[34.84] Your mood was so bad because of 
me today, I thought
[38.44] I would give you a gift 
and convince you.
[41.32] Yes, but you had apologized and 
I had forgiven you too. So why this?
[45.24] Apologizing was not enough.
[54.20] The tears that came in your eyes, 
I had to make amends for those.
[68.12] After all, I thought that you got tears 
in your eyes because of me,
[71.88] then you should also have a smile 
on your face because of me.
[89.16] I had never thought you would care 
for me so much after marriage.
[100.96] Thank God.
[111.84] Thank you, Afnan.
[140.16] How is it possible?
[142.04] That was Afnan, Alizay. 
My eyes cannot be deceived.
[153.92] Why are you smiling?
[156.88] Mama, because your eyes are not
to blame in this, but your heart.
[168.44] You love Afnan so much.
[175.56] That is why you see him everywhere.
[184.36] Now you remember, when your 
friend’s daughter got married,
[187.60] even there you felt some boy 
was just like Afnan,
[190.72] but he was someone else.
[193.60] Alizay,
[194.76] someone looking like Afnan and 
Afnan being there are two different things.
[206.36] It was Afnan.
[212.44] Whether you believe me or not.
[214.40] Mama, I had called Afnan 
on your insistence,
[217.28] he was in a meeting
[224.68] and if he had come to Karachi, 
he would have gone straight home,
[227.16] why would he go to a shopping mall?
[245.48] Okay come, let’s go and eat. 
Come on. Let’s go.
[274.40] Afnan, how was your meeting?
[279.40] Really good.
[281.88] Okay, that is really good.
[284.36] You look really fresh.
[292.44] It feels you are successful
in the work you went for.
[296.68] Yes, that is true.
[308.56] Really the work I went to do,
I was successful in it.
[314.36] Good.
[325.00] What happened? Are you not happy 
on me coming home?
[331.80] No, nothing like that.
[335.40] Okay, you know,
[342.36] the weather in Islamabad 
was really good.
[354.04] I really missed you.
[366.88] And I missed your coffee a lot.
[369.96] I was thinking again and again, 
that had you come to Islamabad with me,
[373.80] it would have been good.
[376.80] When I go to Islamabad next,
I will take you with me.
[385.68] But, right now,
[387.52] make me that delicious coffee 
you make. Please.
[392.08] Yes, yes, sure.
[393.64] I will go make coffee for you. 
You rest.
[438.60] Greetings, Afnan.
[441.16] Afnan, you called after so long.
[443.32] I was waiting for your call for so long.
[445.00] You had said you would call at 
12 am and you called after so long.
[448.56] Yes, yes, I know I took long 
to call you,
[451.72] but I will call you back 
in two minutes. Okay?
[454.44] Afnan, even after calling after so long,
 you are saying two minutes.
[459.64] Please try and understand, Ramsha.
[466.80] You know aunt and Alizay…
[469.52] if they find out I am talking to you,
 then all hell will break loose.
[477.76] Let me find a suitable place,
[479.36] I will sit there and call you comfortably.
[489.44] Okay? Goodbye.
[527.20] Ramsha, I think we should sit 
in the car and eat ice cream.
[532.08] But why Afnan? You had said…
[534.28] Please Ramsha, try and understand.
[538.04] I don’t want that no one sees you 
and me together.
[547.44] Earlier aunt saw us in the mall 
and all hell broke loose.
[554.12] I cannot face further problems.
[559.68] You are regretting marrying me,
 right?
[564.04] What are you saying?
[572.68] How can you even think that?
[580.72] If I regret something, then it is the time
[583.76] when didn’t believe you.
[596.92] I wish…
[599.20] I wish I had believed you, then,
[602.96] today I wouldn’t have had to 
go through these problems.
[614.12] Now I feel like I have stolen something
[623.16] and I am running from people to hide it.
[628.04] Afnan it is possible, meeting like 
this is written in our fate.
[637.60] God must have a reason for this too.
[647.56] I worry you a lot, right?
[651.28] Not you, I am worried with my life.
[660.60] No one is happy.
[663.92] No matter how much I try,
[668.88] someone is sad.
[677.76] Look at Alizay,
[680.44] I go to her, she fights, 
she gets upset, she complains.
[695.48] I don’t understand how to fix 
her complaints.
[700.92] Afnan, Alizay is your wife.
[710.24] Like I have no one in the world 
apart from you,
[720.04] just like that, Alizay and aunt Afsheen 
has no one in the world other than you.
[735.00] Now even uncle is not in this world.
[737.80] You never leave them alone.
[778.96] The dresses are really expensive, 
Afnan.
[781.08] I have never worn such 
expensive clothes.
[783.52] What is wrong with you?
Look, don’t say these things.
[785.60] Listen, now you are Mrs. Afnan, 
understand?
[788.16] These things are not expensive 
for you anymore.
[790.28] You can buy what you want, 
when you want.
[792.84] Thank you, Afnan.
[794.32] Okay listen, the prayer time 
is passing, can I pray here?
[798.56] Right now? Here?
[800.48] Yes, Afnan, now if I pray at home,
 the prayer will get late.
[803.40] When there is place, 
I will pray here. I will come soon.
[805.80] Fine. Fine. Go and pray.
Fine, I will pray and come back.
[824.68] Afnan.
[831.48] You are here?
[834.28] What are you doing here?
[837.00] I….
[838.72] I had told you it is Zohaib 
and Sana’s anniversary,
[841.32] so I came shopping for it.
[843.52] What are you doing here?
[845.12] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[846.92] Coincidentally, I came here to shop.
[851.32] For whom?
[854.00] For you.
[855.20] Who else will I shop for Alizay?
[857.68] I bought all this for you.
[860.36] You brought all this for me?
[862.04] Actually, I wanted to surprise you,
[865.20] but you caught me here.
[868.04] Thank you so much. Okay, 
show me, what is it?
[870.28] Okay look. Why are you looking 
at it right now, go home and see it.
[873.36] Okay, I have given the order 
for the gift.
[875.92] So you come home with me.
[877.04] I was thinking I will shop 
a little more,
[879.96] you go ahead, 
I will come later.
[881.80] Why? Let’s go. Come on, 
let’s go home now.
[884.28] Hey, I was saying..
Come on, come. Come.
[886.84] Come on.
[902.16] Ramsha, Alizay had seen me here,
[904.84] so I had to leave with Alizay.
[907.68] You please take a taxi or cab and go.
[911.76] You please don’t call me.
[935.04] Okay Ramsha, what is wrong?
Why are you crying?
[938.04] I am sorry. I told you I just had 
to leave from there.
[952.48] Okay, come on, don’t cry like this.
[957.36] Afnan, you don’t care about me
 even a little.
[959.44] You didn’t call me once 
after going home.
[971.56] I waited for you all night long,
[973.64] you didn’t even call me once at night.
[985.88] Now, it is morning and 
you remembered me.
[990.16] I really didn’t get time to call.
[1001.68] Anyway, I had no idea, that 
you will take this to your heart.
[1006.44] You really had no idea how 
I would come alone from there?
[1017.64] You know, I have never felt
so alone in my life, Afnan.
[1035.48] If Alizay is your wife, then,
[1038.32] I too am your wife.
[1041.16] When have I denied this?
[1051.32] You stop crying. I am coming back. 
Okay?
[1191.52] Hello.
[1192.72] Hello. Afnan, where are you?
[1197.24] I am in the office, 
why what happened? All okay?
[1205.72] Okay. You are in the office.
[1210.04] Yes, I am in the office. 
I had an important meeting.
[1213.16] What happened? 
Did you want something?
[1215.00] Okay fine, you do your meeting. Okay.
[1301.16] Alizay.
[1304.76] What are you doing here?
[1307.92] How was your meeting?
[1310.36] It went well. Why are you asking?
[1314.44] Who was that girl?
[1316.24] What girl? Who are you talking about?
[1319.24] The same girl because of whom 
you lied and left the office since morning.
[1324.16] Don’t lie to me, Afnan.
[1325.80] Tell me honestly,
who was that girl?
[1327.68] Alizay. Alizay, please, see, 
I was having a meeting here.
[1331.00] All the employees are here 
they are looking.
[1332.56] Please don’t do anything 
like that here…
[1334.40] It is good.
[1335.60] They should also know 
about your actions.
[1337.48] What do you do with your wife?
 You are cheating her.
[1340.28] Alizay, what is wrong with you?
This is not our bedroom.
[1343.44] At least come home. Home…
[1345.12] Excuse me, sir, what time should
I align for the next meeting?
[1347.28] Do one thing…
Excuse me. Listen to me.
[1349.52] Did a new girl get appointed 
at your office?
[1351.60] Alizay, please, what is wrong with you?
[1353.36] What is wrong with you? 
Let me talk to him once.
[1356.16] Did a new girl join your office?
[1358.56] You do one thing, leave.
I will talk to her.
[1362.32] Please. Please.
[1363.80] Why are you so worried?
[1365.28] What is wrong, Alizay?
Why are you doing this?
[1367.16] What am I doing?
[1368.52] Now what trouble have you 
brought on my head after Ramsha.
[1371.60] Alizay, lower your voice, 
I am giving you the last warning.
[1374.88] Don’t do this. I am telling you…
[1376.04] Tell me honestly, 
who was that girl?
[1377.52] It is good that everyone should 
find out how you are cheating me…
[1380.20] Shut up!
[1389.92] Just shut up.
[1393.48] Get out of this place, please.
[1395.72] Get out of this place right now.
[1430.36] Come here. Quickly.
[1454.80] Where did you hide, Ramsha?
[1456.04] What is wrong with you? 
Have you gone mad?
[1457.32] She came to meet you here, right?
[1458.80] Why would Ramsha come to meet me 
here? What is wrong with you?
[1461.44] Do you even know what you did 
in front of everyone?
[1464.04] What were you showing everyone?
[1465.80] You were making a joke out of you and me,
both. Alizay, are you in your senses?
[1472.56] So where did she go?
[1474.64] She went to the academy.
[1477.64] I don’t know where she is.
[1479.80] But she is not here.
[1481.52] You saw I was in a meeting 
when you came.
[1484.20] But do you have any idea what 
you have done coming here.
[1507.08] How dare you?
[1508.56] How dare you to create this scene 
in front of my colleagues?
[1519.20] Did you not have shame?
[1524.76] Do you even have an idea how much 
you got me insulted in front of all of them?
[1528.16] Afnan. What happened? 
What is going on?
[1531.12] Ask this from your daughter.
[1544.84] Who misbehaved with me in a party
with my friends.
[1562.24] She revealed everything about the home.
She got me insulted so badly.
[1564.80] She goes mad in her anger.
[1567.16] Afnan, you are fooling us all.
[1584.80] When you can have an affair with 
another woman with your wife being there,
[1588.04] then can I not even question you?
[1599.52] Afnan, what is Alizay saying?
[1609.04] I am absolutely right.
[1610.40] Ask your beloved nephew.
[1622.44] He has an affair with some girl.
[1634.24] I have caught him red handed.
[1635.88] Lower your voice when talking to me.
[1648.92] You talk to me with respect.
[1650.68] What do you think you will talk to me 
with an attitude and pressurize me?
[1670.12] I will not stay quiet at all.
[1671.68] I am not here to see your drama.
[1679.96] What do you think? You will put 
allegation after allegation on me
[1682.88] and I will agree in front of everyone?
[1694.96] That’s the issue with you,
[1696.72] I come to talk to you, you scream, 
you misbehave.
[1700.24] Why should I not scream?
[1701.96] I will scream louder and tell everyone 
that I cheated me.
[1705.20] I cheated you, right? 
Then you do one thing,
[1707.84] don’t live with me.
[1722.96] But clearly tell me today,
[1725.36] so that my mind will be clear and 
I will make arrangements for this.
[1730.44] For God’s sake, 
you people be quiet.
[1739.52] It is better that you make 
your daughter understand this.
[1745.00] What does he think of himself?
[1748.28] How dare you insult Afnan 
in front of his colleagues.
[1753.92] Mama, you are still blaming me?
[1762.88] Did you not see what he did with me?
[1765.16] I don’t know what he did 
and what you did.
[1770.80] But you two are husband and wife,
[1773.04] and if the husband and 
wife have an argument
[1775.80] it should stay in the four walls,
[1781.12] it shouldn’t go out.
[1785.52] I couldn’t even imagine you would 
turn out to be such a stupid girl.
[1792.48] If you had to talk about something, 
then you should have told me first,
[1795.32] or you should have at least waited
for Afnan to come home.
[1799.32] You should have seated him,
and then talked to him.
[1805.96] How can you insult him 
in front of his colleagues?
[1810.36] You are stupid.
[1819.52] Afnan, whose voice was this?
Where are you?
[1823.12] What is wrong with you Alizay?
I am at a restaurant,
[1826.88] I am with my colleagues.
[1828.36] A colleagues of mine, 
asked me for tea.
[1831.52] Okay listen, the meeting is about to start, 
I will call you back.
[1833.96] Bye.
[1841.48] Hello. Yes,
[1843.12] Afnan, where are you?
[1846.20] I am in the office. Why? 
What happened? All okay?
[1848.76] Okay, you are in the office.
[1852.96] Why are you so worried?
[1854.36] What is wrong, Alizay? 
Why are you doing this?
[1856.32] What am I doing?
[1857.60] Now what trouble have you brought 
on my head after Ramsha.
[1860.52] Alizay, lower your voice, 
I am giving you the last warning.
[1863.76] Don’t do this. I am telling you…
[1865.04] Tell me honestly, who was that girl?
[1866.84] It is good that everyone should find out
how you are cheating me…
[1869.36] Shut up!
[1879.08] Just shut up.
[1882.48] Get out of this place, please.
[1884.88] Get out of this place right now.
[1903.00] Are you upset with me?
[1906.08] No.
[1912.04] Then why are you not talking 
to me properly?
[1915.16] Why are you ignoring me?
[1920.52] Okay, I am sorry.
[1922.00] I shouldn’t have doubted you.
[1927.68] But please, you don’t get 
upset with me further.
[1935.00] Why are you quiet? 
Say something.
[1937.56] When you don’t believe anything I say,
[1943.32] you don’t trust me, then what is the point 
in talking to you?
[1949.68] It is much better that I stay quiet.
[1953.00] Afnan, don’t say that.
[1955.88] When you are quiet, I get sad.
[1972.24] I didn’t tell you a joke, 
why are you laughing?
[1976.52] Yes, but this is no less than 
a joke for me.
[1983.00] Do you even remember when 
we spoke the last time?
[1989.60] It is not that Afnan, 
we talk almost daily.
[1994.60] No Alizay,
[1996.92] you don’t call it talking.
[2000.08] We only fight and argue.
[2006.36] Even if we are spending time 
with each other,
[2009.36] then it is only with doubting each other
[2012.56] and assassinating each other’s character.
[2019.40] And I think it is better
[2021.64] that we don’t spend such time together.
[2039.24] That’s it, I have decided.
[2041.60] I cannot live with Alizay, anymore.
[2044.08] I will leave her.
What is wrong, Afnan?
[2055.08] You are angry right now, leave this topic.
[2057.40] Talk about something else.
[2062.44] it is not about anger, Ramsha.
[2066.52] I cannot live such a life,
[2077.16] every moment of which is a lie.
[2082.64] This dual life is hard to live.
[2094.32] Marrying you, I kept you here.
[2101.28] I deprived you of all your rights.
[2110.36] I even feel embarrassed looking you 
in the eyes.
[2123.76] And how can I live with Alizay?
[2128.80] I have no respect or place 
in her eyes.
[2134.32] If I tell you the truth,
[2137.08] then maybe she wants to live with me 
because of her stubbornness and not her love.
[2148.80] She feels that
[2152.60] if I chose you over her, 
then her ego will be hurt.
[2167.32] You cannot even think how much 
she misbehaved with me.
[2179.44] I stayed quiet only because of aunt.
[2183.32] If some other man was in my place,
[2186.48] they would have taken her out 
their life right there.
[2191.60] You did really good.
[2202.24] If you did this because of aunt Afsheen, 
then you did good.
[2213.08] And Alizay is not just your wife, 
she is your cousin too.
[2221.60] You know aunt and Alizay have no one
in the world other than you.
[2225.72] Even I didn’t have anyone 
other than them.
[2236.44] But what did those people do with dad
being there and after he passed away.
[2242.04] They only schemed.
[2253.72] If they had admitted it 
with their heart
[2256.36] that dad had supported them in their
difficult times, then today,
[2260.48] this would have been happening.
[2272.20] I have decided Ramsha. 
That’s it…
[2275.32] Okay Afnan, 
leave these things.
[2277.36] Leave this topic, 
lets talk about 
something else, please.
[2281.32] What is the point of talking 
about something else?
[2283.92] How long will we look away 
from the truth?
[2293.12] I talk about something else.
[2295.24] I am telling you, Alizay really 
misbehaved with me.
[2310.56] All my employees were looking at me,
they were talking.
[2314.32] What would they be thinking?
[2325.12] I am not a loafer or goon 
from the street
[2327.24] that I can be insulted anywhere.
[2335.92] She is my wife.
[2338.64] If she doesn’t care about my respect, 
then who will?
[2348.12] Even if she had seen me,
[2350.00] she should have at least waited 
for me to come home.
[2357.96] Then she should have said 
what she wanted to.
[2359.76] She should have fought, argued. 
When do I have peace in my life, anyway.
[2369.44] Alizay never understood me
[2372.28] and you saw all this with 
your own eyes.
[2382.36] It is true that
[2385.48] I had loved Alizay, but,
[2390.40] she did all this,
[2393.92] insulted me,
[2396.16] never understanding me, has 
taken herself out of my heart forever.
[2408.28] Now even if I stay with her, 
it will be out of helplessness
[2413.28] and I don’t want to live my life 
out of helplessness, Ramsha.
[2419.56] I cannot do it.
