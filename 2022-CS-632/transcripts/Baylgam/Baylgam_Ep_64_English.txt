Afnan? Afnan? Uncle has gone home, 
you must go home too, I will stay here with Ramsha. There is no need for you to stay here. I am not going anywhere, 
I will stay here. Afnan, you will get unwell like this. Did you guys talk to Shani? No his phone is not going through. And he is on his way anyway so I don’t want to give him such news 
while he is on his way. He will be here by tomorrow then I will talk to him and 
what did the doctors say to you? When will they discharge Ramsha? yes, doctor said they will discharge him 
by tomorrow. Um, I was trying to say that we cannot take Ramsha home for now, do us a favor, take Ramsha 
to your home. Once Shani comes home, I will talk to him and bring her home. Umm yes, he is absolutely right and because Ramsha is already 
going through a trauma, it will be better if she is with you guys. And you know how short-tempered Shani is, God forbid, he immediately starts getting 
angry on Ramsha after coming back. So once he comes back tomorrow, I will talk to him and bring him 
to meet Ramsha, that will be better. Okay, as you wish. You may go home, 
Annie is alone here, I will stay here with Ramsha. Okay as you wish. Bye. 
Bye. I am with Ramsha. What will I say to Ramsha’s in-laws? She was staying here, 
she was our responsibility, such a huge accident happened to her, she lost her baby. What will they say that 
we couldn’t even take care of her? Brother, I have scolded Alizeh a lot, I told her you shouldn’t have
 taken Ramsha but brother now what’s done, it’s not Ramsha’s fault 
or Alizeh’s fault. Whose fault was it and 
whose wasn’t is not the question, in-laws consider it a mistake whenever 
anything happens at a girl’s parents' house. Who would know it better than myself and you what price do 
our daughters have to pay for the accidents that happen
in parents’ house? Brother why are you overthinking? I know that Ramsha’s in-laws are 
very intelligent people, I hope no one will consider this 
Ramsha’s fault. And brother, Alizeh did tell me that Ramsha’s aunt was taking care of 
her with so much love. You just pray for Ramsha, she really needs your prayers and then brother I am very sure that God will bring
 this happiness in her life again and you just pray for her because 
your prayers are very powerful. I don’t know why my prayers never 
get answered in Ramsha’s favor. Whenever I have asked something 
for her, she has never gotten it. Brother, there is a possibility that whatever you are praying for her 
is not good for her. You are the one who says that 
whatever God does is for our good. You are right. May God make decisions 
that are better for Ramsha. Indeed, He is the listener and 
He is the one who knows it all, He is watching everything. Yes, absolutely, indeed. Mom, how did you even think 
not to tell me this and hide it from me. Son, your dad asked me not to tell you 
the whole thing for now. What do you mean? What do you mean by he stopped you? My baby lost his life and you think 
it wasn’t important to tell me? And moreover, my wife didn’t call 
and tell me, that is my value. brother, she tried to call you but 
your phone wasn’t going through. I have told you so many times
to stay quiet. Okay Shani, look, there is no need to get angry 
for no reason, what has to happen, happened. The poor girl is already not well. I will go and make her well. No Shani listen to me, 
don’t go there for God’s sake. Where has Shani gone in such a rush? He is going there to meet Ramsha, please stop him he will go and 
create a scene there. What? Shani has gone to Mr. Qasim’s house? Yes, he has gone to Mr. Qasim’s house. Why did you not stop him? I stopped him a lot but 
when does he listen to me, please stop him, 
he will create a scene there. I asked you not to, 
I asked you not to, that don’t tell him but you will not listen 
you will stay restless. So, he was asking about Ramsha
again and again, he wanted to bring her home 
so I had to tell him. You and your children have made 
my life hell. I came tired from work thinking 
I would rest after going home but with such children, 
there is no rest in my fate. What are you even saying? It is my friend’s farmhouse, 
we all will enjoy a lot and trust me, it will be a very good change 
for you too. No, no Alizeh, I know Shani, he will never allow me, 
I cannot go. Who is asking you to ask Shani? What do you mean? 
I have to inform him. Why do you have to tell Shani? You just told me he has gone 
to Hyderabad for two days, we will go to the farmhouse right now 
and come back, what is the need to tell him? Shani? Shani? so, you got the freedom? Are you in peace now 
after killing my child? What are you saying? Think before you speak, what are you even talking about? He was my child too, if you were his father, 
I was his mother as well, how can you disrespect a mother’s love? What love are you talking about? If you had any love for that child, you would have taken care of 
that child but no you did what you wanted to like you have always done 
what you want, you are free from all the restrictions now, and all the responsibilities and 
that is what you wanted why crying now? Stop crying. Shani? Shani, there is nothing like that, I just made a mistake, 
I didn’t do it on purpose. You didn’t do it on purpose? Why did you even go without 
my permission? Why did you go without my permission? Just because I have no importance to you. I, I called you so many times, I even send you so many messages but your phone wasn’t going through. You even went when my phone 
didn’t go through, you still went because you had to do what you want. There is nothing like that Shani, I, I am very embarrassed 
I made a huge mistake. I am the one who made a mistake, I am the one who made a mistake 
of marrying you. You have always done 
what you wanted, always and we suffered before 
we are still suffering. Shani? Shani, listen to me. 
What is this noise? I don’t want to be with you, I am tired of you and what you do? How much more should I tolerate? I couldn’t even think 
you could be so careless, you have made my life hell. 
Shani? Look Son, we have made a mistake but Ramsha grieving more than you are but there is no point of shouting now. A husband and wife share 
each other’s sorrows, you must understand her pain 
and try to comfort her, that would be better. Mr. Qasim, it is our personal matter, it will be better if you stay quiet. And you, all the crying in front of them, 
what are you trying to prove? You want to show in front of them 
that you are oppressed? That won’t happen because 
I know your reality. Shani, there is no need to shout. If you want to shout at your wife, 
go to your home and do it. There is no need to create this drama 
in my house. So, what do think I am that shameless
that I will take him home after all this? Just understand one thing, I won’t take you away from here, I will leave you here in front of them and
watch you squirm and die in front of them. No No Shani, don’t say that, I am your wife how can you say that? You should have died too with the child. Shut the hell up. Aren’t you ashamed? Your wife is squirming here
 in front of you, she is pain and you don’t care about her? What kind of a husband are you? I have told you it’s a husband and 
wife’s personal matter, do you understand? Don’t interfere else… Else what? Tell me what will you do?
Tell me? Afnan? Afnan, Afnan please you don’t interfere 
in our matter. This is my and Shani’s personal matter uncle please take Shani away from here. I have lost my child now I don’t want to lose my husband,
please Afnan leave. Afnan, I said get quiet. 
Alizeh takes him in the room. Afnan, for God’s sake, quiet, why are you increasing trouble 
for the poor girl? Afnan, Afnan, let’s go. Wow, you have a lot of defenders 
in this home. Stay here with them. No, No Shani, Shani stop. Shani? Shani, I want to go home with you. I don’t know what scene your son 
must have created there, May God keep things well. do one thing, bring your shawl we will go too. What is the point of going now? When I was asking you to go you refused,
now you are asking us to go. There is no use of going now, your son must have done 
whatever he wanted. We won’t get anything 
but embarrassment there now, I am not going to go. The truth is that even I don’t have the courage 
to face Mr Qasim. Don’t you remember 
what happened last time? I had to be so embarrassed 
in front of him because of Shani. I think it’s good we didn’t go. Let both of them come and do one thing, you keep Ramsha in Annie’s room 
for a few days. I will speak to Shani meanwhile 
and make him understand too. You call and ask at least if they leave from there. We should find out at least if Shani 
didn’t create a very big drama. Not me, I will get you the phone, 
you do it. Here, you call yourself.
umm but.. Shani is here. Shani? Son, where is Ramsha? Shani?
Shani? You should be ashamed, you ruined Ramsha’s life and 
now you are sitting here peacefully? What did I do? You have done everything and Ramsha has to pay for it. I didn’t beg her to come with me, she went there by her own choice so please don’t blame me. Whatever is happening with her today 
she is responsible for it herself, she is not a baby. But you are very selfish and I knew it very well that 
you won’t ever realize your mistake. There is still time,
control yourself, before it’s too late. It is my friend’s farmhouse, 
we all will enjoy a lot and trust me, it will be a very good change 
for you too. No, no Alizeh, I know Shani, he will never allow me, I cannot go. Who is asking you to ask Shani? What do you mean? 
I have to inform him. Why do you have to tell Shani? You just told me he has gone 
to Hyderabad for two days, we will go to the farmhouse right now
and come back, what is the need to tell him? Just understand one thing, I won’t take you away from here, I will leave you here in front of them and watch you squirm and 
die in front of them. No, no, Shani, don’t say that, I am your wife how can you say that? you should have died too with the child. Why are you so worried? What should I do if not get worried? Didn’t you see how much wrong things have Shani
said to Ramsha? And even after begging so much 
he didn’t take Ramsha. it’s good that Shani did this to her. What are you saying? I am absolutely right mom. I guess you are forgetting that this is the same Ramsha 
because of which Afnan insulted me. You all can forget 
but I can never forget how painful were those days for me. Remember one thing that Ramsha staying here is 
very dangerous for you because Ramsha will get everyone’s 
sympathy for as long as she lives here. And when Afnan will show 
sympathy towards Ramsha, so you will be the one 
who is hurt the most. Alizeh you shouldn’t have taken 
Ramsha to the farmhouse. Just like everyone else even 
you think it is my fault? Of course it is your fault, that is why brother is so upset with you
and Afnan is so mad at you. Whenever I try that there is 
no complaint from your end, that’s it you make a mistake 
right then and there. Alizeh, just because of your 
own foolish actions, brother and Afnan are being
negative about you. Just pray that Ramsha leaves 
as soon as possible from here else you will be living in hell here, just remember this. Afnan? Mistrusting someone is a sin, looks like you haven’t forgiven her 
by heart yet. Look Afnan I want to see you
and Alizeh happy. Trust me I will be very glad 
if both of you are happy. Where is Ramsha? 
Is she okay? Why don’t you answer me? 
Where is Ramsha? Is she fine? Afnan, she has lost her baby in this accident. Your wife is squirming here 
in front of you, she is pain and you don’t care about her? 
What kind of a husband are you? I have told you it’s a husband and 
wife’s personal matter, do you understand? Don’t interfere else… Else what? Tell me what will you do?
Tell me? Afnan? Afnan, Afnan please you don’t interfere 
in our matter. This is my and Shani’s personal matter uncle please take Shani away from here. I have lost my child now I don’t want to lose my husband,
please Afnan leave. Ramsha, okay now stop crying, if you cry like this you will get 
more unwell. How should I stop crying, Annie? Do I have anything else 
to do except crying now? I do not have anything else 
left except crying. You all, you all should have been with me, none of you is with me. No one cares about me. Please don’t consider yourself 
alone like this. I am here, mom is, we are all with you. Listen to me Annie, such a huge accident has 
happened with me, did you even come to meet me once? No, right? Annie, if the relationship has changed 
between us, is our love over too? It’s not that Ramsha, I know you need a friend right now. What can I do? I have asked Mom so many times 
to make me meet you she is not listening to me. Don’t get disheartened, I will definitely come to meet you. You ask uncle to send Shani here, ask him to send Shani and call me 
home I don’t want to stay here, Annie. Annie you guys are my family, I need you all in these hard times, 
I need support from you all. I don’t have anyone, 
I am all alone, just ask Uncle to call me there 
as soon as possible through Shani, I don’t want to live here anymore,
I need you all. yes, yes, don’t worry, I will talk to Dad, okay? don’t worry at all, 
take care of yourself. Bye.
