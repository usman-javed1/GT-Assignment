[54.44] The day Ramsha has left this home 
and your life,
[58.48] happiness has left this home.
[64.60] At times, I am made to believe that
[69.00] we have really hurt Ramsha.
[72.56] Annie, what are you saying?
[75.04] Ramsha was a really good girl.
[81.16] She had changed herself 
for the will of God.
[87.84] She became sincere to you, 
she started loving you,
[95.40] but you didn’t care for her.
[105.68] This world is filled with karma, brother.
[120.44] Shameless, disgracefully, shameful.
[123.44] What is wrong, Shani? Talk with respect.
[125.96] What are you so angry about?
[127.24] What am I angry about?
[128.40] I am angry that I am not shameless 
like you. Do you understand?
[155.44] What is all this? 
What is he saying, tell me.
[159.60] Tell me the truth, 
what is the matter?
[161.48] Mama, what are you asking her?
[163.24] Ask me if you want to know the truth.
[165.84] I will tell you if you have the courage.
[177.52] I will kill her right now. 
Shani.
[179.28] Papa, leave me. 
I am in my senses.
[182.24] I am in my senses.
[183.84] But now all of you will see
 what I do to her.
[188.28] Come with me. 
I don’t want to go…
[189.72] Come with me. 
I will not leave you.
[191.48] Listen to me.
[199.84] Are you in your senses, Shani?
[202.68] Does anyone treat their wife like this?
[206.44] Whose wife? Mine, right?
[209.48] So I don’t understand why do you 
sympathize with her so much?
[217.60] She is my wife
[219.64] I will do what I want.
[221.76] If she is your wife, 
then consider her your wife.
[225.00] Don’t treat her like an animal.
[232.56] If she doesn’t listen to you,
 then talk to her with love.
[236.76] Locking her in the room 
in not the right treatment.
[242.08] God forbid, had something 
happened to her, then?
[244.48] Yes, so what?
[247.04] At max, she would have died.
[250.48] Everyone has to die.
[343.56] You people are not listening 
to me Listen…
[346.52] Stop it.
[349.24] Not a word.
[350.68] No one will listen to her here.
[357.32] I will not tolerate you in my life
for a moment, and I…
[361.84] Shani listen to me.
[364.08] Ramsha, I divorce you.
[367.60] I divorce you.
[370.52] I divorce you.
[420.80] Afnan,
[423.48] I was coming to talk to you.
[428.12] You don’t need to do anything 
for me, Afnan.
[439.36] No home, neither any flat, 
nor anything else.
[447.28] I don’t want anything at all.
[451.32] After all,
[453.28] I have gotten used to 
going through pain,
[456.20] but I don’t have any further courage
to lift the burden of someone’s favour,
[467.56] so have mercy on me and 
don’t any favour on me.
[472.00] Are you done or do you want 
to say something more too?
[481.92] Look, Adeel’s parents are coming 
tomorrow for your wedding.
[492.72] The Qazi will reach till the evening,
[495.36] the remaining arrangement has 
also been made.
[508.96] Alizay will dress you up.
[522.04] And I hope
[524.96] that you will not do anything tomorrow
[528.40] that will embarrass me.
[587.84] Whose dress is this?
[589.40] Ramsha’s dress has come 
from her In-laws.
[594.40] This has come from her in-laws?
[596.32] The dress is so cheap.
[597.76] What do you think they will send 
some expensive dress?
[600.16] After all, it is her second marriage
[601.56] and this is how weddings take place 
when you get married for the second time.
[604.84] Shehnaz.
[606.48] Shehnaz.
[609.56] Yes, madam?
[610.80] Take these clothes and 
give them to Ramsha.
[613.76] Yes, sure.
[620.76] It was really bad.
[630.72] Bano, you? At this time? 
What are you doing here?
[633.76] Brother Bashir, 
is Mr. Afnan at home?
[636.04] I want to talk to him about 
something important.
[639.76] Tell him that Tabassum has come.
[642.60] Mr. Afnan is not at home right now.
[645.24] What? He is not here?
[646.92] Till when will he come?
[648.16] I don’t know that.
[650.28] He comes by this time daily.
[651.92] Today is madam Ramsha’s wedding,
[653.76] I think he is busy in that.
[655.72] What? Madam Ramsha is 
getting married?
[658.16] So soon?
[659.96] Yes, poor madam Ramsha 
has such fate.
[663.20] The person has an ordinary job, 
he is marrying her to him.
[667.88] After sir left, madam Ramsha 
became a burden for everyone.
[671.68] Now they had to get rid of this burden
off their head.
[674.88] Poor madam Ramsha.
[676.84] Right now madam Afsheen and 
Alizay are at home,
[679.48] if you want then should I call them?
[681.24] No, no, no need to tell anyone I came.
[683.88] I am just going.
[689.84] This wedding cannot take place.
[692.60] Mr. Qazi, why are you sitting here?
[694.96] Now this wedding wont happen.
 These people wasted our time,
[701.12] you don’t waste your time,
go to some other wedding,
[705.08] come on Nabeel.
[706.32] Aunty. Aunty. Aunty, no. Aunty. 
Come on.
[708.24] Aunty, no. Aunty, I beg you.
[711.24] Please don’t end this proposal. 
Aunty,
[713.44] I will do what you tell me to.
[715.44] I will listen to everything you say.
[717.20] I will not say no to anything.
[718.80] I am ready to live like a maid 
in your home too.
[722.28] I will not make any wish.
 I will do what you tell me to.
[725.80] But aunty please don’t end 
this proposal.
[728.88] Please aunty, I beg you.
[731.56] In fact, I am falling to your feet.
[733.80] Aunty please don’t end this proposal.
[738.04] You people are not listening 
to me Listen…
[740.84] Stop it.
[743.64] Not a word.
[745.00] No one will listen to her here.
[752.44] I will not tolerate you in my life
 for a moment, and I…
[756.40] Shani listen to me.
[758.32] Ramsha, I divorce you.
[762.12] I divorce you.
[765.04] I divorce you.
[773.56] Ramsha.
[777.96] What is this?
[779.88] You are still not ready, nor have you
changed your clothes.
[794.72] Why are you sitting here 
like a sick face?
[797.24] What will your in-laws think 
when they see you?
[806.80] Those people must be on their way.
[808.40] At least get ready quickly.
[816.76] Ramsha, please get ready. Weird.
[822.40] I am not interested in knowing 
about your life.
[826.24] But when do you know 
how to live your life?
[830.56] When do you know how to 
take right decisions?
[834.08] If you had taken right decisions,
[837.72] then my father would have been 
alive today.
[841.28] You killed my father.
[844.68] Had you lived your life properly,
[847.40] then today, you wouldn’t be here,
you would have been at your own home.
[850.32] My father would have been alive today.
[853.76] And I wouldn’t hate you so much today.
[872.20] Mr. Afnan. Mr. Afnan,
[873.84] I want to talk to you about 
something important.
[875.56] Hey, what happened? 
Why are you so worried?
[878.40] Actually, you would remember, 
I wanted to tell you something.
[881.72] Fine, come inside and tell me. 
No sir Afnan.
[887.00] Actually, madam Afsheen has fired me.
[890.56] Why did she fire you?
[892.00] Actually, she was afraid that 
I might tell you the reality.
[895.72] Tabassum, what are you saying?
Tell me clearly.
[906.40] Look at this.
[913.88] Don’t you remember how much money
I spent to get her kidnapped.
[917.64] We took such a big risk.
[931.32] Mama, I feel that all our hard work
 will go to waste.
[934.68] All that you did will go to waste.
[963.20] You are still not ready?
[1018.84] I...
[1022.12] When did you come?
[1024.12] I just came.
[1034.44] Where has Adeel’s family reached?
[1036.76] It is time, why have they still not come?
[1040.68] They are not coming.
[1053.08] What?
[1060.48] I mean, the weather is really bad today.
[1073.60] Maybe those people wont be 
able to come,
[1076.80] so I will have to take Ramsha there.
[1095.80] This means her wedding wont 
take place today?
[1110.48] The wedding will take place today.
[1125.12] Ramsha will get married today.
[1137.16] Only those people wont come,
[1140.12] so I am telling you I will take her.
I will manage.
[1159.96] Afnan, then you do one thing, 
take out the car.
[1176.32] I will help her get ready and bring her.
[1179.28] Come on, please Ramsha, get up.
[1183.84] Ramsha, please get up.
[1321.80] This rain will not going to stop.
[1335.56] I think we should go inside 
without waiting further.
[1350.56] Let’s go inside and see.
[1541.64] Come in.
[1548.16] Hey, come on.
Why are you standing there?
[1551.84] Come.
[1557.56] Whose home is this?
[1559.56] Hey, I just told you.
[1562.24] This is my apartment too. 
So you don’t need to afraid.
[1566.40] So why is it empty?
[1567.72] You had said everyone is waiting for us.
[1572.40] Yes, I had said it, but those people 
are not coming.
[1582.36] Ramsha,
[1583.80] this is wanted to tell that you,
[1586.44] actually I…
[1587.72] What Afnan?
[1590.84] Ramsha, listen to me.
[1592.48] Afnan, what do you think of me?
[1598.60] How did you even think this, Afnan.
[1600.68] Ramsha, you are taking me wrong, I…
[1602.24] What is wrong with you? 
How can you think this?
[1604.80] Ramsha.
[1606.44] Ramsha, listen to me.
[1608.32] Ramsha, listen to me.
[1655.04] Come inside.
[1656.12] I don’t want to go.
[1657.48] I told you, come inside.
[1659.00] I told you, I will not go inside!
[1661.68] You won’t agree like this.
[1694.96] Fine, kill me,
[1698.16] but I will not marry you.
[1702.00] I cannot take your life 
even if I want to.
[1704.56] But if today you don’t agree,
[1709.04] then I will surely take my life.
[1711.44] I…
[1712.68] Now tell me, what is your answer?
[1721.20] Either you will see me dying
in front of your eyes today,
[1726.84] or today we will become one.
[1729.36] Tell me, should I kill myself?
[1732.32] Fine, you won’t speak like this.
[1734.80] I will only count till three Ramsha.
[1741.88] After that my dead body will be
in front of you.
[1745.68] One.
[1748.64] Two…
[1751.72] I am ready.
[1779.68] Mama,
[1781.84] did you talk to Afnan? 
Did he call?
[1784.28] Why? What happened?
[1786.36] I have been calling him for so long,
[1788.20] he is not answering my call.
I don’t know where he is.
[1791.20] You know the traffic,
[1793.20] the poor thing must be stuck somewhere.
He must be on his way.
[1795.40] Don’t worry.
[1820.52] Afnan, wait, where are you going?
[1822.88] To look for Ramsha.
[1824.76] It is raining so much outside, 
how can you go out in this weather?
[1828.04] Hey, what is wrong with you?
[1829.72] Ramsha is missing for so long. 
Move out of my way, I will find her.
[1832.80] Afnan, listen to me. 
Afnan, listen to me.
[1835.64] What is it?
[1836.60] I will not let you go out in this weather.
[1838.40] Have you lost your mind?
[1839.80] Why don’t you understand what I am saying?
[1841.52] Don’t come in my way now.
[1843.04] I have to find Ramsha at all cost right now,
[1845.08] because right now my heart and 
mind are not in my control,
[1847.20] please don’t come in my way. 
Afnan…
[1937.56] What happened? Is Afnan back?
[1939.44] No mama, he is not even
 answering my call.
[1942.16] I don’t know what this is.
[1944.76] Hey, so he must be stuck in traffic, 
he must be on his way.
[1948.08] I am really angry at him.
[1949.80] Hey, what is there to be angry in this?
You should be happy Alizay.
[1953.40] You have gotten rid of the problem 
like Ramsha.
[1956.20] Thank God.
[1957.24] Had her wedding stopped,
[1959.20] then it would have been really difficult 
to get rid of her.
[1961.60] Yes, you are right about that.
[1963.68] We have got rid of that girl 
with difficulty.
[1967.04] But you also see
[1968.76] the way Afnan humiliated 
and sent that girl away.
[1972.12] I don’t think she will ever come back 
to this home.
