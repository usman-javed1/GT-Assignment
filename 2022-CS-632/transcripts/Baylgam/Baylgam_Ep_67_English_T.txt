[24.88] Why don’t you quit this job?
[27.04] You are always tired cause of it.
[28.88] Afnan, please,
[30.40] right now I don’t even
have the energy
[32.00] that I can argue with you.
[33.80] Okay fine, fine, don’t argue,
[36.56] but you can at least take a few days
before the engagement, right?
[40.48] But why?
[42.24] Who takes an off for
the engagement, Afnan?
[45.08] What are you saying?
[47.16] I am really tired today,
[49.04] we will go tomorrow.
[56.32] When do you have time for me?
[60.60] Afnan,
[65.00] me and all my time is just for you.
[72.80] Believe me.
[73.96] Really?
[75.84] Are you speaking the truth?
[82.60] Afsheen, I was saying that
[83.92] we should get Afnan and
Alizay married now.
[87.36] It is a good deed,
we shouldn’t delay it.
[89.80] Absolutely right brother,
[91.76] Alizay is your daughter.
[97.04] And after all,
[98.92] she doesn’t have to go to
another home after marriage.
[103.56] Uncle. I am sorry uncle,
[110.24] I am not ready to get
married right now.
[121.88] I want some time,
[123.60] right now, I am focusing
on my career.
[141.16] This girl really doesn’t
care about me.
[144.32] She only cares for her
career and her future.
[148.56] Even if I die, it will not
make a difference to her.
[201.16] Ramsha, get ready quickly,
[203.00] we are getting late and listen,
[203.80] you give me that
white jewelry set.
[206.84] That set is kept in my room,
[208.96] you take it from the
dressing table.
[210.52] Okay listen,
[212.36] I cannot go with you,
[213.72] you go yourself, please.
[215.76] Why? Come on, it will be fun
[218.00] and we are going
somewhere after so long.
[220.84] You know Shani.
[227.76] He will create a mountain out
of a mole hill for no reason,
[230.20] it is better that I don’t go.
[232.08] You go yourself, Annie, please.
[234.08] Nothing will happen,
[234.88] after all, we have taken
permission from mama,
[236.08] she will take care of it.
[236.92] My friend has invited
you with so much love.
[239.40] Try and understand what I say.
[241.04] I don’t want to
understand anything,
[242.08] just come on. Quickly get ready.
[244.12] You are really stubborn.
[312.12] Mama.
[312.76] Hey, why are you making
so much noise?
[314.68] What has happened?
[315.64] Where is Ramsha?
[319.44] She went to her friend’s place with Annie,
for her friend’s birthday
[323.56] With whose permission?
[326.92] With my permission.
[329.28] She is my wife,
[330.96] I will make all her decisions.
[387.24] Annie.
[388.56] Annie, went to the poolside
to take a picture.
[392.28] Oh no, excuse me. –
[401.36] Hello.
[402.92] Yes, Shani, I had called you.
[404.88] Your number was off.
[407.04] So what was the need
for you to go?
[409.24] Come back right now.
[411.84] Right now?
[413.08] How can I come back right now,
immediately?
[416.64] I want my documents,
[418.00] and I need them right now.
[422.80] Okay fine,
I will come, Shani.
[424.84] I am leaving from
here immediately.
[428.92] I don’t know
where Annie went.
[431.60] Listen.
[478.12] What are you doing here?
[480.08] I am waiting for an auto.
[484.56] Come on, sit in the car,
I will drop you.
[486.20] There is no need for that.
[487.44] I will go myself.
[489.32] I didn’t ask you to argue,
[491.72] go sit in the car.
[577.72] What are you looking at?
[580.00] I am absolutely right.
[581.04] I have not seen such
a cheap man in my life.
[585.40] Don’t say that, Afnan.
[587.68] Whatever he is, however he is,
[590.00] Shani is my husband.
[593.40] Is this how a husband is like?
[605.80] A husband is a woman’s support,
[615.92] but the husbands who
[618.00] use their wife as
a crutch are shameless.
[624.96] He wants to go to Dubai,
[626.48] that’s why he needed money,
[628.08] or else he is not like that.
[631.36] He is like that,
[633.20] he only holds his benefit dear.
[636.04] Every person has good
and bad qualities, Afnan.
[646.60] I hope that he
will change soon.
[649.60] People like him never
change, Ramsha.
[658.60] He will never change,
believe me.
[661.84] How can you say
this about him?
[664.08] Because I know him,
I have understood him.
[671.48] Whatever he is doing
is for himself.
[680.36] And he is only in touch with me
[681.68] because he knows
[682.56] he can take money from
me through you.
[692.28] I have understood his game.
[695.44] So why did you give him money?
[704.32] I had even told you earlier,
not to give him money.
[708.12] So what do I do?
[710.16] Should I leave you
to suffer sorrow?
[719.48] Try and understand what
I am saying, Ramsha.
[722.96] If I give you the money right now,
and he takes you to his home,
[732.68] later on, if he doesn’t agree to
anything you say, then?
[741.12] What will you do then?
[743.56] I will tolerate it.
[753.36] You stop worrying about me.
[755.92] Why do I not worry,
Ramsha?
[765.80] Why would you
tolerate everything?
[767.16] Why don’t you leave him?
[782.16] What do you want to say?
[786.00] You take a divorce from
Shani and marry me.
[818.88] How did you even
think about this?
[830.16] You consider me to be such
a lowlife, Afnan?
[834.16] I didn’t mean that.
[846.68] You should have let me have
a little respect in your eyes, Afnan.
[856.64] I am not as cheap as
you have thought of me.
[864.88] Leave it. I will go in an auto.
[897.12] You are ruining your life like this.
[900.08] You just once,
[902.36] just once say that you don’t
want to get married,
[904.76] I will support you,
I will stand with you.
[907.00] What is wrong with you, Afnan?
[909.44] What are you saying?
[911.04] Why are you torturing me
and giving me pain?
[915.72] These things you are saying
is torturing me, Afnan.
[918.16] For God’s sake,
be quiet and
[920.40] take me to the hall.
[924.48] I am already really late,
[926.92] if we get late further again, then
[928.56] I will get humiliated because
of you once again.
[930.56] I will not let anything
like this happen.
[932.28] I promise you,
[933.96] you speak the truth once,
[936.68] have courage and tell me,
[937.96] I will stand by you.
[938.92] Shani wont be able to
say anything to you.
[941.04] What is wrong with you?
[942.20] Why are you saying these things?
[944.16] Why are you giving me pain?
[945.24] Why are you torturing
me with what you say?
[947.20] Because I want to marry you.
[1014.36] I did love Afnan,
[1016.60] but I didn’t commit a sin.
[1022.20] This is the one truth
[1024.40] and the second truth is
[1027.12] that I don’t have any place
for Afnan in my heart.
[1082.64] I am not a hypocrite like that
[1085.68] I lie to people and deceive them.
[1090.76] How have I deceived you?
[1094.32] We were friends for so long,
[1097.56] you talked to me for so long,
[1100.68] and you didn’t even tell me once
that you are engaged.
[1103.28] If this is not cheating them
what is it, Afnan?
[1112.20] It was not my not my
responsibility to...
[1114.72] ... tell you everything
about my personal life.
[1116.48] Befriending me was not
your responsibility either.
[1119.76] It was not even your responsibility
to talk to me. Then?
[1122.56] Still you did all this?
[1127.52] I am not answerable to
you for everything.
[1129.72] Because you are a liar,
[1133.08] that is why you are saying this.
[1135.44] When a person is not
clear themselves,
[1137.08] that’s when they say this.
[1144.04] Accept it,
[1146.68] that you are a cheater.
[1158.60] Yes, when a person loves,
[1162.32] then they also have a desire
to achieve it too.
[1165.48] And I feel no shame in saying this,
[1169.80] that I love you even today.
[1173.28] Just like putting my love
in your heart is something,
[1176.16] that is not in your control,
[1179.84] just like that
[1180.40] it is not in my control to take
out your love from my heart.
[1185.60] I love you even today.
[1233.52] You think you will get off
the car at this time...
[1235.72] ... of the night dressed as a bride ...
[1237.76] ...and you think I will leave you ...
[1239.04] ...in the middle of the road and go?
[1240.84] I think you have forgotten,
[1252.44] you had left me midway like this.
[1256.00] If I am marrying Shani today, then
[1258.28] why are you worried?
[1260.52] If I stand on the road like this,
[1262.96] then why do you worry?
[1264.56] Why?
[1275.52] You take a divorce from
Shani and marry me.
[1291.96] How did you even
think about this?
[1298.64] You consider me to be
such a lowlife, Afnan?
[1357.16] What are you doing, Ramsha?
[1360.76] Ramsha.
[1361.32] Yes, what happened?
[1362.32] The milk would have fallen.
[1363.64] Where are you lost?
[1365.36] I have turned off the stove.
[1368.80] What happened?
[1374.88] What is the matter, Ramsha?
[1377.00] Nothing.
[1379.88] Did something happen?
[1381.24] Did brother say something?
[1384.64] No, nothing happened.
[1387.76] That is not possible.
[1389.20] Surely something happened
[1390.44] because of which you are so disturbed.
[1392.16] Nothing happened Annie, it is all fine.
[1393.76] Why do you worry?
[1395.80] Look here. Tell me.
[1398.96] Nothing happened.
[1401.60] Ramsha, something has happened.
[1403.12] There is surely something that
[1404.40] is eating you inside.
[1405.48] Tell me, what happened?
[1445.80] Hey, you are talking about a little longer.
[1448.80] I have even paid all the money, then
[1450.92] why am I not getting the visa?
[1456.24] You had told me earlier,
[1457.08] it would come in a week,
[1458.28] now you are saying fifteen days.
[1461.72] You are talking about fifteen days.
[1465.60] Yes, yes, my preparation is complete,
[1468.12] you don’t worry about it.
[1469.92] Yes. Yes, send it. Yes.
[1476.40] Take me along with you to Dubai.
[1479.60] Look Shani,
[1481.36] take me with you.
[1483.12] I want to live with you.
[1488.20] The two of us will go there
and start a new life,
[1492.12] and only you and
I will be in that new life.
[1495.44] No third person would be there.
[1497.44] We will leave all the bitterness
and regrets here,
[1502.72] and start a new life.
[1506.24] I want to live with you.
[1509.04] I want to live my life
with you, Shani.
[1513.72] Ramsha, have you gone mad that
[1515.24] I will take you to Dubai?
[1518.04] I cannot tolerate you here,
[1519.76] I don’t want to see your face.
[1521.04] I want to go to Dubai
because of this,
[1522.48] and you want me to
take you along?
[1525.72] We have been married
for so long, Shani.
[1529.40] Did you not love me even
once in this time?
[1535.32] You are not worth loving.
[1543.24] Yes,
[1544.96] I am right. No one would
want to accept you.
[1550.40] Thank God, that I married you
[1554.24] or else no one would have
given you any importance.
[1556.52] I wish you were not my husband.
[1667.60] You are not worth loving.
[1672.32] Yes, I am right.
[1673.08] No one would want to accept you.
[1676.20] Thank God, that I married you
[1680.04] or else no one would have given
you any importance.
[1686.52] Whatever he is, however he is,
[1688.88] Shani is my husband.
[1691.08] Is this how a husband is like?
[1692.68] A husband is a woman’s support,
[1696.44] but the husbands who use their
wife as a crutch are shameless.
[1704.48] He is like that, he only
holds his benefit dear.
[1707.64] I hope that he will change soon.
[1710.60] People like him never change, Ramsha.
[1716.24] He will never change, believe me.
[1719.72] How can you say this about him?
[1721.76] Because I know him, I have understood him.
[1724.44] Whatever he is doing is for himself.
[1727.36] And he is only in touch with me
[1728.76] because he knows
[1729.72] he can take money from me through you.
[1732.40] I have understood his game.
[1860.52] Where is Shani?
[1862.00] He went out with his friend from Dubai.
[1866.12] Make your son understand,
[1867.84] talk some sense in him.
[1869.88] He is crazy about going to Dubai.
[1873.12] What does he lack here?
[1874.36] He will be ruined. You will see.
[1886.60] He will go to Dubai!
[1927.48] Hello.
[1929.84] Hello.
[1932.56] Aunt, I cannot hear her,
[1934.60] I will go tell my friend…
[1936.52] Child, tell your friend
to call you later,
[1938.92] have breakfast.
[1940.60] yes, I will go tell her this.
[1943.12] Hello. Hello. Hello.
[1964.40] Why are you calling
me again and again
[1965.60] and bothering me, Afnan?
[1967.16] Ramsha, I am really embarrassed.
[1969.64] I am really sorry.
[1977.44] Believe me, whatever I did,
I didn’t do it on purpose.
[1981.36] I didn’t mean to hurt you .
[1985.36] Look Afnan,
[1986.40] you have done what you had to.
[1994.72] Don’t call me again and again
and bother me, please.
[1999.12] I don’t want to bother you,
Ramsha,
[2001.96] I just want to apologize to you.
[2006.36] Fine, I have forgiven you.
[2014.16] But don’t call me after this.
[2023.24] If you call me after this,
Afnan, then
[2026.08] I will switch off my phone.
[2105.04] Mama,
[2106.92] aunt Ruqaiyah called,
[2108.48] she is asking when we will reach.
[2111.28] She wants to go on time.
[2113.68] Child, I have a lot of pain in my feet,
[2116.60] that is why I am sitting
in the sun to compress it.
[2127.84] Your father said he will not go.
[2133.28] You do one thing, take
Annie and Ramsha and go.
[2140.00] No, then no one is going.
[2141.76] Son, it will not look nice.
[2148.12] It is the first wedding in
sister Ruqaiyah’s home.
[2150.88] She has been with us in our
happiness and sorrow.
[2164.56] She will not like that no one from
our home went to the wedding.
[2168.08] Whatever work you
have do it later,
[2170.08] go right now.
[2177.84] Mama, you are so unwell.
[2181.04] Do one thing, send brother
and Ramsha together.
[2193.32] If you get unwell while
we are gone, then?
[2195.76] I am not leaving you and going.
[2198.80] Mama, neither is Annie going,
[2201.56] nor are you going,
[2202.76] so I am not taking Ramsha.
[2209.88] You make an excuse to her,
[2211.40] tell them, we are not coming.
[2218.28] Hey, you are always ready to go
to parties of your friends.
[2230.24] Now when we are talking about
going in a family gathering,
[2232.60] you are making
a hundred excuses.
[2243.88] Go, call Ramsha.
[2247.72] Mama, I am not taking
Ramsha along,
[2248.96] I will go alone.
[2250.40] Hey, she is your wife,
[2252.04] take her along with you.
[2262.68] If you go meet family
without your wife,
[2264.64] then people will say
a hundred things.
[2265.88] Child, go and call Ramsha.
[2274.76] Ramsha.
