[22.56] How can he divorce her like this?
[25.56] If there was some fight 
between husband and wife,
[28.64] if there was an unpleasant argument,
[31.24] they should have at least 
involved their parents
[34.28] and consulted their elders 
for better decisions.
[39.08] Shani divorced her suddenly,
[41.68] I didn’t get it.
[79.48] Ramsha, why didn’t you tell me
 all this earlier?
[96.92] Had you told me all this earlier,
[99.84] I would have ripped the face 
of Danish Kamal.
[118.48] These are the morons
[120.40] who take advantage of 
the naivety of girls
[124.20] and use them for their purpose
[141.80] and our poor girls cannot even say
 anything to anyone due to their honor
[150.32] and that is what the morons 
take advantage of.
[158.60] Ramsha,
[160.44] you should have trusted me, 
you should have told me,
[167.16] I would have spoken to Shani,
[169.68] made him understand,
[182.56] at least all this wouldn’t have happened, 
whatever has happened.
[191.08] I got so scared, Aunt,
[196.96] I didn’t understand what to do.
[199.72] He took advantage of this fear,
[209.20] but it is not your fault,
[214.00] it is our fault too.
[228.48] We parents,
[231.08] we give full freedom 
to our children first,
[233.68] don’t restrict them from anything
[237.08] and when they
[239.92] get into some trouble due 
to this freedom,
[246.20] then we don’t trust them,
[261.96] we don’t trust anything they say.
[267.28] I remember,
[270.00] mom and dad repetitively told me 
to step back,
[283.40] and fix yourself but,
[286.20] but I didn’t listen to them at all,
[289.60] it is just because of that 
I am facing all this,
[293.36] I wish I would have listened 
to them, Aunt,
[297.72] this regret wouldn’t have been 
in my fate today.
[306.24] Let me go check, mom.
[326.56] Yes but if your face remains ashen
[329.44] and stress-laden like this then everyone
will doubt that something is wrong.
[332.12] They might even find out.
[334.32] So please, relax yourself.
[337.68] We got out of a problem 
like this before.
[341.76] We can get out of it again.
[344.68] You have 20 minutes.
[346.76] In 20 minutes, I will drop you 
at your house.
[350.00] Try to get into your normal zone 
by that time.
[352.36] Okay?
[363.80] Here son, have tea.
[368.04] I have served the tea for Afsheen 
in Ramsha’s room.
[372.16] Shani is not home?
[374.48] Shani has his flight to Dubai 
this morning so he left, son.
[387.04] I was thinking that had Ramsha 
told this to me earlier,
[391.68] I would have not let things get this far.
[402.96] May such people rot in hell,
[406.00] these people like Danish Kamal,
 they have destroyed our kids.
[420.28] Now look,
[421.76] our Ramsha got the label of being 
divorced at such a young age,
[434.44] I am so worried of thinking 
about her future that
[439.04] what will happen next?
[441.56] Aunt,
[443.12] where will Ramsha spend her days
of waiting period?
[446.84] My child,
[448.64] you don’t worry for Ramsha at all,
[460.72] Ramsha will spend her waiting period
 here with me,
[470.60] now even Shani is not here, 
he has gone to Dubai.
[481.72] Ramsha is a very patient girl,
[495.52] I am sure God will reward her 
for her patience.
[500.24] If God wills.
[501.76] Have tea, son.
[505.16] okay Aunt, please call Aunt,
[508.20] I need to go for an important work.
[510.60] Okay.
[539.16] Oh my Lord,
[541.76] I have never complained to you ever,
[547.08] never,
[550.36] whatever you have done 
so far I agree to it,
[557.12] I am sure there is an expedience 
in everything you do
[564.84] but my heart,
[567.72] my heart is not at peace,
[571.24] I feel like my heart will stop,
[576.24] Oh Lord,
[577.68] I just see darkness everywhere,
[580.80] I have been very lonely,
[583.32] I have nothing left, 
everything is over,
[588.24] oh my Lord,
[591.12] help me.
[593.44] Oh my Lord, never leave me,
[596.04] you always stay with me.
[599.44] Oh my Lord, you just be enough for me,
[603.20] help me, give me peace, support me,
[607.96] give peace to my heart,
[612.08] give peace to my heart.
[682.36] Umm I killed him.
[686.20] I have murdered him, Afnan.
[689.52] Killed who? Relax and tell me, 
please?
[693.12] He was dying in front of my eyes.
I have killed him,
[696.36] he is dead, I have killed him. 
He is dead.
[699.52] Ramsha, Ramsha, Relax, relax, 
you come here, sit here.
[702.56] If police find out it will be 
a huge problem,
[705.64] they will tell my family.
[708.16] Nothing will happen,
[709.76] who did you murder? 
How did all this happen?
[718.96] I was thinking that had Ramsha 
told this to me earlier,
[723.64] I would have not let things get this far.
[728.76] May such people rot in hell,
[731.52] these people like Danish Kamal, 
they have destroyed our kids.
[742.32] Now look, our Ramsha got the label 
of being divorced at such a young age,
[752.80] I am so worried of thinking 
about her future that
[757.60] what will happen next?
[873.44] What are you trying to say?
[877.24] Divorce Shani and marry me.
[893.60] How can you even think that?
[900.36] You think I am that shallow, Afnan?
[904.28] That is not what I mean.
[911.80] You should have at least let some 
respect be there in my eyes,
[917.40] I am not as shallow as you think of me.
[922.56] Just let it be, I will go by the auto.
[1004.68] Afnan, I was thinking that
[1007.36] when brother comes back,
[1010.04] how would I tell him about 
Ramsha’s divorce,
[1013.72] because he is already not well,
[1016.60] it will be very traumatic for him.
[1018.28] Mom, what else can we do?
[1021.44] I mean, see I never get that girl,
[1026.80] she made her videos first, got them viral
[1031.16] and then she eloped,
[1034.40] she got married, got divorced,
[1036.24] and she already got married after 
so much difficulty now this divorce,
[1040.16] what can we do?
[1042.64] Aren’t you ashamed?
[1050.80] You think Ramsha must have taken 
divorce Shani by her own choice?
[1055.44] She got her video viral 
by her own choice?
[1064.68] Alizeh, you are a woman yourself
[1066.24] and despite being a woman you cannot 
understand another woman’s pain?
[1069.00] Do you have any idea she has been 
through so much pain during this time?
[1075.20] So she is responsible for it 
herself, Afnan.
[1084.20] If she got married to Shani,
[1086.32] she should have compromised 
and lived with him.
[1096.28] And anyway, Shani has accepted her
even after so much has happened,
[1100.96] else who marries such girls?
[1128.00] What happened? Why are you 
looking at me like this?
[1130.56] You rejected her as well.
[1146.20] Yes,
[1149.96] I guess that was the biggest mistake 
of my life.
[1175.12] Did you see him?
[1176.80] How fearlessly he has confessed 
his love in front of both of us.
[1180.52] He doesn’t care at all that
even you are sitting here
[1185.68] and then you tell me 
I am behaving rudely.
[1187.60] Doesn’t he have manners?
[1189.20] Alizeh, stay quiet for a while,
[1193.04] you have given him a chance 
to say all this.
[1199.04] Hmm, that is what I was thinking
[1200.84] for so long, how come you are 
not saying anything to me?
[1203.08] Because you just see 
my fault in everything,
[1205.72] you don’t see any fault of his, 
whatever he is doing.
[1208.84] You don’t care about me at all,
[1210.64] no one cares about me 
in this house.
[1294.84] Anwar, shall I serve food?
[1297.28] Hmm?
[1299.72] What happened?
[1302.16] Who were you talking on call with?
[1308.04] Your child called from Dubai.
[1311.40] Okay, what was he saying?
[1316.24] He is coming back.
[1319.68] So soon?
[1321.52] But he had no plans of coming 
very soon.
[1326.16] Your son is destroyed.
[1334.72] He has suffered loss in the business.
[1340.04] Oh god, I hope everything is well.
[1349.80] Now, what will happen, now?
[1355.48] Now you have to decide
[1358.52] will you keep your son in this house
or Ramsha?
[1375.72] Listen?
[1383.20] Go and tell Ramsha to make 
arrangements for herself elsewhere.
[1449.64] My child, your waiting period 
is also over
[1453.88] and Shani is coming back too,
[1461.76] I kept you in this house until 
Shani wasn’t here
[1465.44] but I cannot keep you here 
while Shani is present here,
[1469.32] you try to understand that 
I am helpless.
[1484.40] What are you saying, Mom?
[1491.76] Where will she go?
[1500.52] Ramsha, my child,
[1503.28] you must go to brother Qasim’s house.
[1514.36] He still loves you like 
before and I think
[1518.76] there is no safer place for you 
in this world than his house.
[1548.00] No Aunt,
[1550.24] I won’t go to his house,
[1564.64] I don’t want to go there again 
and be a burden on him.
[1581.00] He has done a lot of favors on me,
he is my guardian
[1585.44] and one must not bother 
their guardians.
[1596.04] My child,
[1598.68] Shani is coming tomorrow and 
your uncle asked me
[1602.72] to tell you to make arrangements 
for yourself before Shani comes back.
[1615.00] How can you ask her to leave, Mom?
[1626.48] This is cruel.
[1636.08] Annie,
[1637.88] I am as helpless as 
you are right now.
[1657.16] I tried to convince your dad 
as much as I could but now,
[1661.88] it is not in my control 
to convince him.
[1704.28] I don’t know what has happened 
to Mom and Dad,
[1706.92] if brother is coming back, 
does it mean you will leave?
[1717.96] What is this behavior? 
Where will you go?
[1797.00] what you have seen is 
not the complete truth.
[1799.88] If you just listen to me once, 
I will explain everything.
[1803.52] What I have seen and heard 
is not the complete truth?
[1807.36] Then what is the truth?
[1809.24] What is the truth that I will hear today,
 and my heart will find ease?
[1814.08] We provided refuge to you.
[1816.08] Kept you in our house, 
I always defended you.
[1819.20] I treated you like my own daughter
[1821.68] and this how you repaid me?
Believe me,
[1824.04] had my daughter done something 
similar I would have killed her.
[1836.64] You have ended everything.
[1839.88] You have ruined everything,
[1843.52] the beautiful relationship 
between me and you,
[1848.24] the peace of this house,
[1850.76] the trust of my mother,
[1854.52] and our respect.
[1857.80] Everything.
[1860.76] Everyone is blaming me
[1862.80] without letting me explain myself.
[1865.32] No one heard me.
[1872.40] Someone should have asked me 
once what happened.
[1875.48] What was my helplessness that
I resorted to this step?
[1878.16] What was this helplessness Ramsha
[1880.36] that took you Danish Kamal’s 
bedroom?
[1888.72] Your mom died and 
went six feet under,
[1894.24] and you have sent me to the grave
while I am still alive.
[1899.00] Ramsha, I will not tolerate you 
for a single second in my life and I…
[1903.64] Shani, Listen to …
[1905.76] Ramsha, I divorce you.
[1909.40] I divorce you.
[1912.40] I divorce you!!
[1927.28] My child,
[1929.72] Shani is coming tomorrow and 
your uncle asked me to tell you
[1933.64] to make arrangements for yourself 
before Shani comes back.
[1942.12] How can you ask her to leave, Mom?
[1945.16] This is cruel.
[1952.80] Annie,
[1954.76] I am as helpless as you are right now.
[1961.20] I tried to convince your dad 
as much as I could but now,
[1966.00] it is not in my control to convince him.
[2031.04] I didn’t know what to do,
[2034.04] I suddenly thought about you 
so I called you immediately.
[2037.88] Look,
[2039.84] I just want that you keep me 
with you in your flat,
[2043.68] I will do some job and 
earn money through that
[2047.20] and pay half of the rent of your flat
[2050.36] and I will take care of all the expenses
equally with you,
[2054.24] I just need home.
[2056.12] What are you saying, Ramsha?
[2058.20] A friend in need is a friend indeed,
[2060.96] and when I was new in this city, 
your dad helped me in every way.
[2066.68] Yes,
[2069.32] Dad was very nice,
[2072.04] he used to help everyone.
[2073.84] True that,
[2075.36] and who helps anyone without 
any reason nowadays?
[2078.44] You can come to my home 
without any worries,
[2081.16] I leave for job around 12, 
come before that.
[2085.32] Okay thank you.
[2088.48] Bye.
[2145.36] Are you leaving?
[2147.84] Yes,
[2149.84] obviously,
[2151.80] this is not my parents’ home anymore
that I can stay here.
[2157.00] People are so right
[2159.80] when they say that parent’s home 
is only until parents are alive
[2164.84] and now this is not even 
my in-law’s house anymore,
[2168.44] so I will have to leave,
[2172.04] how long can I stay at 
any relatives’ house for?
[2176.20] Ramsha…
[2180.96] Don’t worry,
[2184.64] I know,
[2186.84] no matter if I live in this house or not,
[2191.04] I will always stay in your heart for sure.
[2197.40] I thought that we would always live 
together after you married my brother,
[2204.32] I didn’t know all this would happen.
