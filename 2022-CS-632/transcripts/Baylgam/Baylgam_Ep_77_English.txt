Afnan, are you upset with me? No. So then, why are you
not talking to me properly? Why are you ignoring me? Okay, I am sorry, I shouldn’t have doubted you but please don’t get
more upset with me. Why are you quiet?
Say something. When you don’t believe
in anything I say, when there is no trust, what is the point of talking to you? It is way better for me to stay quiet. Afnan, don’t say that, when you get quiet, I get sad. I haven’t cracked any joke, why are you laughing? Yes, but it is no less
than a joke for me. Do you even remember when
was the last time we talked? It is not that Afnan, we almost talk daily. No, Alizeh, that is not called talking, we just fight and argue. Even if we are spending
time with each other, we are just doubting each
other during that time and character-assassinating
each other. I feel that its better that we don’t spend much
time together at all. Anyway, I still don’t want to argue
much with you. Hello, brother Jamshed, where are you?
I am off, you know that my class gets
off early Friday and Saturday, okay fine I will come
by rickshaw on my own. Greetings, Sister, do you study in this academy? yes. Sister, I want to get
my younger sister admitted here, can you guide me? Yes, definitely but the admission office must have
closed at this time, do one thing come between 8 to 10 in the morning
and get her admission done. And what will be the process
of admission here? Alizeh, shall we go to some restaurant
and eat if you are hungry? Hmm, we can eat. My meeting got so
prolonged today that I didn’t get time to have lunch. What happened? That’s Ramsha? Who is Ramsha talking to? I don’t know who that is. Yes, but we should know who is the stranger she is talking to. Hey where are you going? I, umm, I should go and check who is this stranger she is talking to. The way she is talking he doesn’t seem like a stranger, I think you shouldn’t go and interfere. Look, whatever it is, Ramsha is my responsibility, I should know who she is talking to. Afnan, what do we know who is that boy, what does he do? What do you know Ramsha might
not want to tell us about him. Why do you just want to go and
ask her for no reason? Yes, but we must know who it is. Stop Afnan Come home now and then ask, don't you have to ask on the road? It will seem strange Look if you go like this, we don’t know what
she might think, like you are here to do
some investigation, there will be a show in
the street for no reason, people will watch too, let it be, let’s just go home right now. Greetings. Greetings, where are you coming
from at this time? Umm, Academy, where else? Why? Why are you asking like this? Because you got late
while coming back today, I thought I should ask, I got worried. No, no, I didn’t come late. In fact, I have come early today, I come late daily. Anyway, Afnan, I am tired, I will rest for a bit. Hmm, you must be tired, go, rest. I should go and check who is this stranger she is talking to. The way she is talking he doesn’t seem like a stranger, I think you shouldn’t go and interfere. Look, whatever it is, Ramsha is my responsibility, I should know who she is talking to. Afnan, what do we know
who is that boy, what does he do? What do you know Ramsha might
not want to tell us about him. Why do you just want to go and
ask her for no reason? Yes, but we must know who it is. Look if you go like this, we don’t know what
she might think, like you are here to do
some investigation, there will be a show in
the street for no reason, people will watch too, let it be, let’s just go home right now. Afnan? What happened?
You didn’t even change yet and you are still standing here. I am thinking about who was the
guy Ramsha was talking to. Why are you thinking
so much about it? Because usually, she shares
everything with me, she never talked about that guy. Afnan, she must have not told you because you are not
so important to her. It is not important that
she tells you everything, and Ramsha is
a single girl anyway, she might have started
to like someone and she doesn’t want
to tell anyone of us yet. Impossible. Why impossible? Ramsha used to talk to
boys before as well. She even used to talk to you, right? You were a stranger to him as well. Jamshed? Jamshed? Jamshed? Yes, Mr. Afnan? I have strictly asked you to
go pick Ramsha every day, why didn’t you go today? Sir I was going but Madam Ramsha called me and asked me not to come and
she will come on her own. May I go, sir? Go. Do you believe it now? Greetings. Greetings, how are you Ramsha? Who are you?
I didn’t recognize you. Recognizing doesn't take much time, we will talk and get to
know each other. Tell me, how are you? Looks like you are
a very free man, don’t ever call me again! Are you busy? No. No, you were talking on
call with someone. No, no, I am not busy, you had some work? Yes, I didn’t ask you about your
wellbeing for so long, so I thought I should ask today. How are you and how are the classes
of the academy going? Everything is going well by
the grace of God. Did someone come to meet
you at the academy today? No, why? Yes, because I was thinking that your relatives
don’t come to meet you at home, so there is a possibility that any of your relatives came to
meet you at the academy. No one came to meet me Afnan. And I don’t have any relative in
this world now anyway, so someone’s presence and
absence doesn’t make any difference to me. I will go and meet uncle. hello? How are you, Ramsha? I even asked you the other day
to never call again on my number, so then why are you bothering me? Ramsha, your voice is so nice, I just feel like listening
to it all the time. What happened?
Whose call was it? No one’s. I am going to make tea,
do you want to have it? No. I think it is a very important call,
you must attend. No, it is not important. Ramsha didn’t come? She must be here anytime. Didn’t you tell her? I did tell her but her long conversations on
the call won’t end, I have been noticing brother, I don’t know who she is busy
with on call all the time. Yes, uncle, did you call me? Yes, Greetings,
may peace be upon you Greetings. My child, the books
you asked me to bring, I have brought them,
they are in the room. Thank you, Uncle. Thank you so much. Stay blessed. By the way brother, it is not good to talk on
call for so long all the time. The sugar is less in tea. Shall I get it for you? No. Annie, get me the tea already, I have been
waiting for so long. Were you making bone broth? Shani? Shani? Hey Ramsha, my child, what happened, my child? Sit, sit. I am not here to sit. Where is your son? Call him. Annie, go call Shani here. Umm, why are you so angry? Shani? Ramsha, my child, what happened? What is it? Like I said, where is your son? Call him, I want to talk to him. What is it? Why are you yelling? Shani? Talk in a lower tone, there is no need to yell. What do you want? Yeah? Why are you doing all this now? What did I do? Who have you given my number to? I am asking you, who did you give my number to?
Who did you give it to? Who did I give your number to? Don’t try to act like
you don’t know, Shani, I know you very well. You have a habit of doing
such pathetic things and you are the only one
who can do this. I will not let this move be successful. Shani, what is Ramsha saying? I will tell you. He has given my number
to one of his friends and now he has been calling
me and bothering me. You won’t let me live
in peace, right? You cannot see me happy, right? Now he has started to do
these disgusting things too. What do I need to do
all these acts for? Why would I do this? Because you don’t want
me to be happy in life, you cannot see all this. Look Shani, I am telling you one last time, I was tolerating all this till
you were my husband, I was being courteous towards you but now I won’t do it. That is why it will be better if you stop bothering me else, I won’t take very long to
complain to the police. Ramsha, my child, listen
to me, My child. She is talking weirdly, I haven’t done any such thing. Greetings, Dad. Greetings, may peace be upon you. What happened?
What are you looking for? Hey, my blood pressure medicine, Ramsha has kept it somewhere, I can’t find it. I don’t know where is it. okay, don’t worry, let me call her and ask. No, I have called her
she is not attending it, why don’t you do one thing, call the academy’s number,
here it’s in it. Take it. Thank you. Umm, dad, no one is picking up there. But don’t worry I will try again in a while. yes, do it and ask her where has
she kept the medicine, I don’t even have the prescription. Are you feeling well? I am fine, don’t worry, just ask her. Greetings, Islamic Academy. Greetings, Afnan Qasim here, please make me talk to Ramsha. Ramsha? Tell me her full name? Ramsha Sajid, who studies in the level
two of your academy. Hold on for a second. Yes, yes, she hasn’t come today,
she is off today. Really? Okay, I am really sorry, actually, I thought she had
come to the academy, I will call home and check. Greetings, Afnan. Greetings. Where are you, Ramsha? I am in the academy, Afnan. Hello? Hello? Ramsha, you are in the Academy? I have been calling you for so long, even dad was calling you, why weren’t you receiving it? Actually, I was in the class so you know I cannot take
a call in the class, why what has happened? Is everything all right? Yes, everything is fine, I wanted to ask about dad’s medicine, he has been looking for it for so long, tell me where have you kept them? Yes, I have kept Uncle’s medicine in the second drawer of his side table, check there. Okay, thank you. I had to lie because of this
Shani for no reason, I cannot even tell Uncle and Afnan, I don’t want to worry them for me. I will handle Shani myself. Ask him, ask him why is he doing all this? He just wants to compromise
whatever honor is left. What am I hearing? What is this matter? What is all this that
you are doing? What do you want? Dad, I didn’t do anything. If you didn’t do anything, is Ramsha lying then? Yes, she is lying. She wants to take
revenge from me, she has come here
and did this drama and you guys are believing her and humiliating me instead? I can’t accept that
you are innocent. You must have definitely
done something else what is the need for her to lie? Tell me honestly Shani, whom have you given the number? Who is your friend who
has been bothering her? Dad I swear to your life, Mom, I swear to your life, I haven’t done anything at all. I am telling you just wants to degrade me in
front of you guys, she is angry and she is taking that out on me, nothing else. She wants to take revenge. I will tell her. What happened?
Whose call was it? I don’t know someone
is bothering me, I am getting calls from an
unknown number again and again. Okay, give it to me, I will talk. No Afnan, I will block it right now, there is no need to talk. The way she is talking he
doesn’t seem like a stranger, I think you shouldn’t go
and interfere. Look, whatever it is, Ramsha is my responsibility, I should know who she is talking to. Afnan, what do
we know who is that boy, what does he do? What do you know Ramsha might
not want to tell us about him. Why do you just want to go and
ask her for no reason? Yes, but we must know who it is. Look if you go like this, we don’t know what
she might think, like you are here to do
