[21.04] I actually wanted to say 
that as you know
[23.28] this world cannot see anyone smiling 
and laughing
[27.00] before they talk and brainwash Shani, 
I want that
[32.36] if you may allow,
[34.72] let us get Ramsha and Shani married.
[55.88] How about we get them married 
this Friday sister-in-law?
[60.40] Uncle, what is the rush?
[64.72] What is wrong with you, Ramsha?
[66.56] You shouldn’t interfere 
when elders are talking.
[72.00] Hey, no, no sister-in-law,
[74.32] you, you don’t stop her,
[76.12] she is a little girl, she is naïve,
[78.64] she has gone through a huge trauma
[81.56] so it is only fair to have a bit of bitterness 
in her temperament.
[86.24] Umm, so what is your decision then?
[90.28] Okay Anwar,
[93.64] whatever you think is right.
[100.76] And by the way,
[102.68] Ramsha’s all wedding preparations 
are complete,
[106.64] I just have to buy a few little things
[111.24] so I will do that.
[112.76] Hey sister-in-law, no, no,
[115.84] don’t embarrass me,
[117.60] you don’t have to bother,
[119.92] whatever our daughter needs, I and Salma 
will bring it for her our self,
[123.96] just don’t worry at all.
[127.56] Umm, it’s just that I wanted 
to say one more thing,
[135.20] I want their marriage to happen 
with simplicity,
[146.48] yes, we will invite the whole family 
at the reception,
[150.68] you know since your daughter Ramsha’s 
wedding has been called off,
[156.24] we have been unable 
to satisfy the family,
[163.16] I don’t want the family to come 
to the marriage ceremony
[166.12] and things go sideways,
[168.44] I will just invite a couple of friends
[171.80] and let’s do the wedding ceremony 
with simplicity.
[177.60] Okay.
[181.20] congratulations sister-in-law,
[183.24] here have tea.
[187.76] You have it. 
Yes, I will.
[192.24] I wish
[194.68] brother was alive so he would 
have been so happy.
[208.32] May God grants him the highest level 
in heaven.
[215.36] Amen. 
Amen.
[242.96] Bashir?
[245.48] yes madam?
[246.48] Ask the driver to get the car out. 
Okay.
[249.84] Umm, Af..
[252.44] Afnan, I was coming to you 
only I wanted to talk.
[257.68] Did you talk to mom?
[261.96] No,
[264.76] but Alizeh I wanted to ask 
something from you
[269.12] and I want you to give me 
a completely honest answer.
[275.60] Ask?
[279.72] Do you not want to marry me?
[286.88] Do you not like me?
[291.36] What do you mean?
[299.92] I mean to say that
[303.72] is it that do you like someone else
[308.52] and you are just marrying me 
because of pressure from aunt?
[316.32] You are doubting me?
[319.56] I am just asking a question.
[323.68] I cannot believe that is what you think
about me, Afnan?
[329.24] So why don’t you respond?
[331.12] Do you like someone else?
[333.76] If I would like someone else, Afnan,
[335.64] I will accept it here in front of you,
[338.40] I won’t keep any doubts 
in my heart like you.
[341.68] I have just asked you a question.
[343.44] It is not a question, you are putting
an allegation on me.
[346.36] What?
[347.40] What is going on here?
[350.56] Ask your nephew,
[352.96] he thinks I am involved with someone else.
[369.08] Can’t believe it.
[377.24] Afnan, what am I hearing?
[380.28] Nothing aunt, I just asked her a question,
[382.72] she is having some misunderstanding.
[385.92] you are doubting my daughter?
[389.48] How can you even think like that about me?
[397.44] the sad part is that you don’t even believe me.
[434.28] What were you doing outside?
[435.52] A friend came so 
I went to drop her to the door.
[438.68] Don’t you understand?
[440.92] I have told you so many times
 to not go to the gate.
[448.52] I don’t want to see you at the gate next time,
do you understand?
[456.48] And yes,
[459.28] we are about to get married
[461.68] so fix your behavior
[469.80] because I won’t tolerate all this 
after marriage.
[536.60] Mom,
[538.44] mom, I need to talk to you 
about something.
[540.04] Come here, come sit with me, 
even I want to talk to you,
[542.84] in fact I was just coming to your room.
[544.72] Look at this, Salma has sent 
the wedding dress for you,
[548.04] it is very beautiful and 
this color will suit you a lot.
[553.08] You will look very beautiful 
when you wear this.
[561.96] Ramsha,
[564.56] do you know that
[567.16] I had a strange fear in my heart,
[576.52] I used to think that
[578.88] whether I will even get a chance 
to see you as a bride while I am alive
[589.36] or would there ever be 
a chance that
[592.20] you are happily married 
while I am still alive,
[603.96] but I can’t believe it,
[606.64] this is the biggest happiness of my life,
[616.92] I am very happy my child,
[618.76] all my fears have gone away
[621.48] and the fear that I had about 
you leaving this house after marriage
[625.92] and then how will I live here, 
that fear has gone too.
[636.40] You will be very happy.
[646.72] Oh God!
[649.48] While speaking, I totally forgot
[652.12] that you were here to talk about something,
you wanted to say something to me.
[656.72] Nothing mom,
[659.72] you just always have to pray for me.
[666.12] is that something you need to say?
[670.56] Moms always pray for their children
[675.92] and for you,
[680.64] for you, I pray with every breath I take.
[684.76] It has been just a few days 
to your father’s death,
[689.28] I thought of marrying you 
in a simple ceremony
[694.60] but Salma did so many preparations 
in a couple of days.
[705.40] Salma is very nice, my child,
[709.84] your aunt is actually very nice
[713.44] and nowadays it is very lucky of you 
to get such a mother-in-law,
[723.56] what can be bigger than this?
[726.72] She will keep you very happy
[731.04] and all my fears and frights 
have gone away now,
[735.28] now wipe your tears, okay?
[737.40] Stop crying and go and 
try your wedding dress,
[742.20] if there are any measurement issues, 
we will get it fixed, okay?
[749.76] Take this with you.
[784.36] Usually, girls say that marry me 
for my sake,
[789.20] they cry, they beg,
[791.52] they request and you are telling me 
not to marry you for your sake?
[797.52] It’s unbelievable.
[799.12] Afnan, you are very selfish.
[802.36] Look if I will be strong and independent,
[805.00] it’s good for both of us.
[813.72] I wanted to ask something from you
[816.44] and I want you to give me a completely 
honest answer.
[823.68] Ask?
[827.64] Do you not want to marry me?
[833.56] Do you not like me?
[838.08] What do you mean?
[846.52] I mean to say that
[850.56] is it that do you like someone else
[855.40] and you are just marrying me 
because of pressure from aunt?
[865.56] You are doubting me?
[868.76] I am just asking a question.
[873.00] I cannot believe that is what you think 
about me, Afnan?
[878.48] So why don’t you respond?
[880.44] Do you like someone else?
[883.12] If I would like someone else, Afnan,
[884.96] I will accept it here in front of you,
[887.80] I won’t keep any doubts 
in my heart like you.
[914.24] Alizeh, you have misinterpreted 
what Afnan said.
[917.44] Mom, I was sure that as always, 
you will defend Afnan.
[922.16] I know that his way of talking was wrong,
[925.00] he shouldn’t have asked like this,
[928.88] look this is not what he meant, trust me.
[933.64] You trusted him, mom, 
I don’t want to trust him.
[937.12] Don’t force me for everything.
[939.96] But you have hurt Afnan.
[942.04] I have hurt Afnan?
[943.80] And what about how he has hurt me?
[946.24] It doesn’t make any difference to you, 
or anyone, whether it’s you or him.
[950.24] I think you are very tired right now,
[952.48] it will be better if you go 
to your room and rest,
[955.04] you are disliking anything 
that I say right now,
[957.48] we will talk later.
[974.56] Greetings brother.
[975.92] Greetings, May peace be upon you.
[979.00] Hey Afnan didn’t come back 
from office yet?
[981.12] What?
[982.56] Though he is usually back by this time.
[985.32] Exactly, even I am worried now,
[987.64] if there is any work or meeting, 
he usually calls me,
[991.00] he didn’t even inform me.
[992.36] My mobile ran out of battery,
 you call him and ask.
[995.88] I will ask him, but don’t worry, I will…
[999.76] Let me know.
[1002.04] I hope everything is all right.
[1024.32] What is this, Ramsha?
[1026.12] Why did you refuse the henna girl?
[1028.24] Will it look nice if a bride doesn’t 
have henna on her hands?
[1031.44] Annie, I didn’t feel like it.
[1037.56] And by the way,
[1039.08] who will do all the house chores
if I get henna applied?
[1045.36] I will do the house chores,
[1047.12] I am a sister of both bride and groom,
[1049.16] so I have two relationships,
[1050.80] so I will do all the chores, 
just get henna applied.
[1057.20] I don’t feel like getting it applied, 
Annie, don’t force me.
[1061.12] Ramsha, are you happy 
to marry brother?
[1069.44] I don’t know Annie,
[1072.24] I don’t know myself what am I feeling,
[1076.84] I just know that
[1080.24] I have to fulfill this relationship 
under any circumstances
[1083.64] whether I am happy or not.
[1086.84] Actually, you guys never had 
any understanding
[1088.84] so that is why his behavior was always 
like this with you.
[1091.32] You were his cousin but now 
you will be his wife
[1094.16] so automatically his relationship 
will get better with you
[1097.00] and he will start behaving well with you.
[1100.36] Ramsha, this is your jewelry,
[1103.52] I gave rest of the stuff to sister-in-law.
[1109.84] And yes, Annie,
[1111.24] did you call Ayesha?
[1113.08] When will she come to do her makeup?
[1117.12] Yes, yes, mom, she said 
she will come early
[1119.24] so she must be here anytime now.
[1120.92] Look into it, do remind her on call,
[1123.92] your dad is always in a rush, 
he will get very upset if it gets late.
[1127.48] Okay mom,
[1129.72] now she is coming you must get ready 
and do get henna applied, okay?
[1140.96] try to understand,
[1142.92] the situation has changed now.
[1145.96] So, did you forget what Shani did to me?
[1150.20] I didn’t forget anything,
[1154.60] I remember everything,
[1158.12] you leaving this house,
[1162.16] your marriage being called off
[1168.68] and then your dad passing away 
due to this news,
[1175.68] and then whatever Shani did taking 
advantage of all these matters,
[1180.24] I remember everything, 
I haven’t forgotten anything,
[1181.68] I haven’t forgotten anything.
[1231.32] Hey Shani, how are you son?
[1232.76] Hey uncle, how are you?
 Greetings.
[1234.00] Greetings.
[1235.72] My child, I have heard you are getting
married to Sajid’s daughter today?
[1240.36] Yes uncle.
[1241.52] That’s amazing that 
you are marrying your cousin,
[1244.72] it will be a very good deed for you.
[1247.24] And by the way, who asks such girl 
after such dishonor
[1249.68] and after one’s father passes away.
[1252.96] Your dad made a very good decision,
[1255.24] I just pray you are always happy,
[1256.96] may God keep you happy 
and blessed son. Bye.
[1262.28] What? What is there to laugh about?
[1263.96] What should I do if not laugh?
[1265.88] I thought that the neighborhood is joking
[1267.84] when they said your dad is 
marrying you to your cousin
[1270.48] but your dad actually made you 
a sacrificial animal.
[1274.08] By the way, Shani,
[1275.24] you don’t have to go out for 
entertainment now,
[1277.64] you will be entertained at home.
[1279.52] He is absolutely right,
[1281.00] and your video might get viral
 to this way
[1283.96] and there will be a lot of fun and games.
[1285.64] By the way, do one thing,
[1288.28] tell me the Instagram and 
TikTok account of sister-in-law,
[1291.32] we might get famous like that too.
[1294.00] I told you not to joke about this.
[1296.48] Shani, listen? I am joking.
[1299.60] Shani. Hey look at him, dude.
[1309.56] Ramsha?
[1311.80] Mom, what do you do?
[1314.48] You have been busy with work 
since morning, I am watching you,
[1317.12] you must take some care of yourself too.
[1318.68] Oh, I will rest, my child, 
do one thing, have milk,
[1322.28] you never know how much time 
it takes in the wedding ceremony
[1324.16] and the ceremonies after that.
[1330.28] You haven’t eaten anything 
since morning,
[1332.16] you won’t feel hungry if you have milk.
[1335.48] I am not hungry already mom.
[1341.88] Anyway,
[1343.68] are you feeling okay, mom?
[1345.24] Yes, everything is fine
[1348.04] but I don’t know why I have a headache
since morning.
[1353.28] Why mom? 
Didn’t you take your medicine?
[1355.36] No, I didn’t,
[1356.64] I forgot taking the medicine amidst 
all the house chores.
[1360.28] Mom, you are…
[1362.96] You have been taking care of 
everyone since morning
[1364.64] you just forgot taking care of yourself.
[1366.20] Why don’t you take care 
of yourself in time?
[1368.64] Go and have medicine and rest for a while,
please mom, take care of yourself.
[1373.40] Okay, okay don’t worry 
I will take medicines.
[1450.16] Are you mad?
[1452.56] You know very well that I have 
no interest in you Shani,
[1458.92] I can go through the pain of being
dishonored but a trouble like yourself,
[1462.92] may God never write such fate 
for anyone.
[1467.04] I won’t even marry you if you are 
the last man in this world.
[1482.16] it is very important for you 
to marry Ramsha.
[1488.48] My child, once you get married 
to Ramsha,
[1491.92] and she becomes your wife,
[1493.80] so everything that is hers will be yours,
 you will be the owner,
[1499.44] that is why whatever I am saying,
[1501.72] just consider it with cool mind on it,
[1504.96] my child, if apologizing for a bit 
will make our life,
[1510.52] if it will bring us benefit 
then what is the harm in it?
[1518.00] What should I do if not laugh?
[1519.88] I thought that the neighborhood is joking
[1521.92] when they said your dad is marrying you
 to your cousin
[1524.44] but your dad actually made you 
a sacrificial animal.
[1528.12] By the way, Shani,
[1529.20] you don’t have to go out for 
entertainment now,
[1531.60] you will be entertained at home.
[1533.64] He is absolutely right,
[1535.00] and your video might get viral to this way
[1537.72] and there will be a lot of fun and games.
[1539.64] By the way, do one thing,
[1542.20] tell me the Instagram and 
TikTok account of sister-in-law,
[1545.20] we might get face like that too.
[1549.92] She went to the shop humiliated me, 
humiliated dad,
[1553.84] she was asking us for the accountability
of the shop.
[1554.84] So then why should I ask for it?
[1556.48] I shouldn’t even ask for what is my right?
It is my father’s shop;
[1559.28] I will take the accountability of 
every penny from you.
[1561.52] Your father is dead,
do you understand?
[1564.84] But I am alive,
[1566.56] and until I am alive, I will take 
accountability of each and everything,
[1569.48] I have all the right on the shop.
[1576.52] Fear that day,
[1578.16] she was just asking for the accounts 
of the shop today,
[1581.56] in future she will ask the custody 
of the same shop
[1585.40] and things won’t stop here Shani,
[1589.04] who does this house belong 
to where you roam freely?
[1593.28] Where you talk loudly? 
Who does this house belong to?
[1595.72] Her,
[1597.12] her mother, her father,
[1599.60] nothing belongs to your father,
[1603.92] if she throws her out of here,
[1607.00] you won’t get anything, 
I won’t get anything either,
[1610.08] we will be empty handed, empty.
[1621.96] What is this?
[1624.32] Why aren’t you ready yet?
[1627.04] You have your wedding, come son,
[1629.48] hurry up and get ready, good boy.
[1632.84] Dad, my friends are making fun of me,
[1635.52] they are calling me names, 
telling me I am shameless
[1643.08] and yes, I am shameless that
I agreed to marry such a girl.
[1647.64] Dude, what nonsense?
[1655.96] Don’t think anything, 
there is nothing like that.
[1658.48] Go, I am telling you, go,
[1660.36] you have your wedding, 
go, good boy.
[1663.20] Dad, you became so selfish
[1665.28] that you don’t care about my happiness, 
my will or my respect.
[1673.20] At least give me the right to marry 
by my own choice and happiness
[1677.84] to a nice girl.
[1685.16] When did I say that?
[1688.12] When did I say
[1690.56] that you can not marry 
by your own choice?
[1703.24] You must definitely do it,
[1705.60] you can do the second marriage,
[1716.52] no one will stop you.
[1719.32] Look,
[1720.88] just marry Ramsha right here 
and right now,
[1733.48] once this shop and this house gets
 in your name,
[1742.88] then you can marry whoever you want,
[1747.44] no one will stop you, I will get you 
married again myself.
[1751.44] Anwar?
[1752.96] What are you even saying?
[1755.24] What did you say?
[1758.20] Sister-in-law,
[1760.68] where did you come from? 
And you heard everything?
[1768.60] You didn’t feel any shame at all?
[1772.16] You got so carried away with the greed
[1774.36] that you even forgot the respect 
of your relationships?
[1789.16] Hey,
[1790.88] this is how you pay us back for the trust
I and your niece had on you?
[1800.40] If your brother was alive today,
[1803.48] he would have died 
after listening to this.
[1817.20] At least I didn’t expect this from you,
[1819.92] I couldn’t even think you would do this.
[1829.56] You,
[1831.00] you, have hurt my pride,
[1835.08] you,
[1836.36] you broke my trust,
[1842.24] you have broken my dignity, Anwar,
[1844.40] you broke my dignity.
[1849.80] What are you thinking?
[1852.36] You think that the poor woman’s tears 
have changed the game?
[1858.52] No.
[1863.92] No, son, no,
[1865.72] the game is still in my control, mine.
[1875.00] And I will do all that I didn’t want to do 
in order to win this game.
[1889.24] You do what I told you,
[1891.52] get ready,
[1893.88] I will look into the rest.
[1898.36] Sister-in-law?
[1901.60] Sister-in-law?
[1926.44] Look Ramsha,
[1928.08] Shani and Anwar has realized 
their mistake, my child
[1933.04] and Anwar has kept his word,
[1936.16] he hasn’t given me any chance 
to complain by far,
[1940.84] Anwar is regularly giving me money now
[1945.48] and he comes and properly tells me 
all the accounts of the shop.
[1949.08] Hey, he is even taking care of our expenses,
[1952.80] I have no complaints from him, my child.
[1957.16] Tell me something? 
They are our family, right?
[1964.32] If we won’t trust them then 
who else will we trust?
[1967.40] Just let it be mom,
[1969.04] uncle Anwar can change so quickly?
[1971.32] It is impossible,
[1973.00] I know him very well, 
he is making us fool.
[1982.04] When did I say
[1984.68] that you cannot marry 
by your own choice?
[1989.60] You must definitely do it,
[1991.76] you can do the second marriage,
[1997.64] no one will stop you.
[2000.64] Look,
[2002.16] just marry Ramsha right here 
and right now,
[2009.96] once this shop and this house 
gets in your name,
[2016.72] then you can marry whoever you want,
[2021.32] no one will stop you,
[2022.92] I will get you married again myself.
[2032.60] Why did you leave, Sajid?
[2035.04] Leaving us here to get wretched 
by this world,
[2042.28] there is no one of my own here,
[2045.32] how will I take care of myself 
and Ramsha?
[2054.76] Anwar?
[2056.32] What is this behavior?
[2059.96] No sister-in-law, what misbehavior?
[2064.36] I am here with so much respect 
and honor
[2069.76] to tell you that please
[2072.64] ask Ramsha to get ready for marriage,
[2081.60] and come,
[2082.60] let’s get them married, 
let’s start the ceremony,
[2085.72] come.
[2088.76] I have very well understood 
the greed in your intentions,
[2095.48] and I will not sacrifice my daughter 
for your greed at all,
[2100.60] her father died
[2102.68] but her mother is still alive,
[2106.36] I will never let what you want to happen.
[2109.52] Really?
[2111.48] Really?
[2113.92] That is what you will do?
[2117.00] Okay, tell me,
[2120.24] what will you do? Yeah?
[2124.80] I will do what’s right for my daughter.
[2131.92] No,
[2134.04] you cannot do anything
[2137.44] except shedding tears.
[2149.76] What you have to do,
[2152.28] we will see that later,

[2166.48] what I can do.
