[26.28] I, Ramsha,
[29.52] do not want to marry you.
[32.68] Did you hear that?
[34.48] And have you ever seen yourself?
[36.32] Yeah?
[37.36] Have you ever seen yourself 
you look so weird,
[41.28] you don’t even know the ABCs of education,
[43.88] you uneducated man,
[45.40] just passing matric doesn’t make 
one educated.
[48.40] And how did you even think that I,
[50.76] such a beautiful girl will marry you?
[57.24] Actually I… 
Enough!
[59.32] Just shut up!
[61.96] Because when you speak, 
I feel pain in my ears.
[67.24] Have you seen yourself?
[68.64] You don't have the manners to talk,
 to sit or to walk!
[72.44] You have no manners at all and
 what do you wear?
[76.84] If you look at the boys from good families
[79.20] you will then know the way of 
speaking and sitting!
[88.04] Ramsha, I love you.
[90.00] To hell with your love,
[92.60] I have shown you your place 
in person today,
[96.88] next time if you even talk about love,
[99.96] I will humiliate you in front of everyone 
so that you will remember it for life.
[111.60] What did you say to Dad?
[114.04] If you think that I will get pressurized by him
and marry you then you are mistaken.
[118.72] Are you mad?
[120.28] Why would I say that to Uncle?
[123.48] Listen to me very carefully,
[126.04] I won’t marry you.
[128.00] Yes, so even I have no interest 
in marrying you.
[130.08] Okay enough now,
[131.88] I understand you very well.
[134.48] You know that no one is after you 
after all this dishonor,
[137.52] that is why you want to get with me.
[139.52] Are you mad?
[141.72] You know very well that I have 
no interest in you Shani,
[148.92] I can go through the pain of being 
dishonored but a trouble like yourself,
[152.92] may God never write such fate for anyone.
[157.12] I won’t even marry you if you are 
the last man in this world,
[161.76] understand?
[187.40] Alizey,
[189.24] what have you done to your room?
[191.72] Mom,
[193.32] I have to go to a party tomorrow, 
I cannot decide what should I wear,
[196.96] why don’t you help me and tell me 
which one looks nice?
[199.44] Does this look nice?
[200.52] Forget everything, tell me, 
when are you free?
[205.72] What?
[206.60] I need to take you to the boutique to 
buy the dresses for your wedding.
[210.32] What?
[211.92] My wedding?
[214.12] So just buy them at the time of wedding,
what is the rush?
[217.76] I and brother have decided
[220.16] that we will get you and 
Afnan married soon.
[224.44] Mom, don’t you guys have anything 
else to do?
[227.52] Whenever I talk to you about this,
this is the same response you give me
[231.08] and I have lot of work,
[233.56] but the most important of them all 
is to get married
[237.40] and listen Alizey,
[238.92] if you have no interest in 
your wedding shopping
[241.48] then tell me clearly, I will go alone
[244.08] and do all the shopping
[245.76] but this time I won't listen to you at all,
[247.92] just understand this.
[280.72] Ramsha?
[282.80] I have been watching you being 
on the phone for so long,
[287.24] Hey, I am calling sister Shiza.
[290.40] I spoke to her assistant Komal 
a few days ago
[292.72] but she is not taking my call now,
[295.24] I have been calling her for so many days,
[299.28] I even asked Komal to talk 
to sister Shiza about my job
[302.56] but she didn’t respond yet,
[304.56] I don’t know where are they busy.
[308.36] Do you think that the people of 
this channel will give you a job?
[311.28] Yes, 100%.
[313.72] You know what? When I went to 
sister Shiza’s morning show
[316.72] she gave me so much love and respect,
[320.24] she treated me like I was a superstar.
[323.72] I know that she will definitely help me.
[326.72] That was temporary,
[328.56] she needed ratings at that time,
[330.52] and now there must be other people 
in your place,
[333.40] this is how this field is,
[335.68] Four days of good times and 
then ensues bad times.
[339.16] You always talk about disappointment 
Annie
[342.44] and you make me disappointed to,
[345.36] at least some time say something
 encouraging,
[349.88] anyway,
[351.20] I am very sure that sister Shiza will 
definitely help me, you will see.
[355.36] But I am not,
[357.20] media people just know their own purpose 
and nothing else.
[362.88] Anyway,
[364.04] mom is saying she has kneaded the dough,
you go make flatbread.
[369.92] Okay.
[420.36] Who is it?
[424.60] It’s me Faizan from the shop, 
greetings sister.
[427.12] Greetings.
[428.28] Sister, the vehicle with the stock is here,
[430.08] we need to take out the cartons of oil, 
send brother Anwar,
[432.64] brother Shani is not at the shop.
[435.16] Okay I will send him,
[436.28] Quickly, there is a lot of footfall of 
the customers on the shop.
[439.92] There is a lot of footfall?
[441.52] But uncle and Shani were telling
[444.52] that there are no customers 
on the shop
[446.76] so there is no income from the shop 
then how did the footfall increase?
[450.12] What? Is that what brother Anwar tell you?
[456.36] Don’t say anything to brother Anwar,
he will fire me.
[465.84] Don’t worry, your name won’t be taken,
[467.68] you may go. 
Thank you sister.
[470.44] Sister just quickly send brother Anwar,
[472.40] I am going to the ship there are 
a lot of customers there.
[497.20] Your total is Rs3424.
[500.32] Looks like you got your committee 
this time. Yes?
[506.16] Your total is Rs 2700,
[511.76] okay. Yes?
[514.52] Bring it.
[516.68] Didn’t you make the receipt? Oh God.
[518.80] Go and get the receipt made.
[529.68] Hey? Ramsha, you?
[532.64] My child, if you wanted something, 
you could have asked me,
[536.40] I would have sent it, what was the need
 for you to come?
[541.76] I am here to see
[543.88] that how sincere our people are with me
after my dad passed away.
[550.72] What does that mean?
[552.92] You said that there is no stock in the shop
and there are no customers at all.
[556.64] But looking at the shop it doesn’t seem so.
[562.72] What are you looking at?
[565.72] Come on do your work. Go away,
[571.00] and you must go too, 
go, go home.
[574.48] Your widowed sister in law has 
a lot of trust in you,
[578.36] and that is how you choose to hurt 
the trust of two sincere women?
[583.12] Ramsha, there is no need to talk rubbish,
[588.36] go away and don’t talk nonsense.
[591.08] Let us work, go.
[592.88] Don’t you understand what dad is saying?
[595.24] Go away.
[596.52] I need the accounts of the shop.
[603.96] What?
[611.12] You need the accounts? You?
[614.96] Yes.
[621.20] Do one thing, come,
[623.92] come here, come sit here 
and take the calculations from us.
[628.00] If the time requires, I will do that too,
[640.00] there is nothing wrong with girls 
working nowadays.
[649.84] And by the way,
[652.32] a father’s business is taken care 
by their children only.
[655.24] Ramsha, there is no need 
to create a scene here,
[658.72] I am asking you to go home.
[660.12] Why?
[661.36] You really like watching 
mockery of people.
[671.20] You enjoy everyone’s mockery a lot
[673.88] and now when it’s your time 
you are feeling bad?
[680.44] Ramsha,
[684.24] don’t test my patience.
[691.08] Go,
[692.64] go away from here.
[695.60] I am going but this doesn’t end here.
[705.88] I will take accountability of everything,
[717.64] every penny.
[755.84] Sister in law,
[759.08] now your waiting period has ended too
[762.96] but you didn’t respond?
[769.36] Anwar asks me daily that
[772.16] what did sister in law think about it?
[776.48] Salma,
[779.16] to be honest
[781.32] I am unable to make a decision,
[788.44] you know that
[792.16] whatever Shani did to my daughter,
[804.72] after that my heart is not satisfied.
[811.56] Sister in law,
[814.28] Shani got sheered away
[816.56] and then he even apologized to you 
and me.
[828.32] Okay forget it, he made a mistake,
[835.56] look he is a kid, he grew up 
in front of you,
[840.04] you tell me,
[841.72] have you heard of anything ever
[843.72] about him since he was a child till,
he grew up, no, right?
[850.40] He just got sheered away 
and made a mistake
[854.32] like our Ramsha did.
[863.40] Leave it,
[864.88] forgive him and let it go
[867.32] and you just think about it and 
give me an answer then.
[907.00] I am here to see
[909.20] that how sincere our people are with me 
after my dad passed away.
[914.64] You said that there is no stock in the shop 
and there are no customers at all.
[918.52] But looking at the shop it 
doesn’t seem so.
[923.24] Your widowed sister in law has 
a lot of trust in you,
[927.20] and that is how you choose to hurt 
the trust of two sincere women?
[932.24] And by the way,
[934.68] a father’s business is taken care 
by their children only.
[938.76] Ramsha, there is no need 
to create a scene here,
[942.00] I am asking you to go home.
[943.96] You enjoy everyone’s mockery a lot
[946.96] and now when it’s your time 
you are feeling bad?
[951.44] don’t test my patience.
[954.92] Go, go away from here.
[959.52] I am going
[960.72] but this doesn’t end here.
[969.88] I will take accountability of everything,
[972.44] every penny.
[987.52] Shani?
[988.92] Shani?
[994.60] Ramsha?
[996.04] Ramsha?
[997.12] Ramsha?
[998.16] What happened? Talk slowly, 
I can hear.
[1001.56] What do you think you will make 
a mockery out of us,
[1003.76] humiliate us and we will stay quiet?
[1005.08] I haven’t humiliated you yet,
[1006.72] I came back quietly from there, 
caring about the relationship we had
[1009.88] else I would have told you.
[1011.40] Else what would you do?
What would you do?
[1013.32] Talk slowly Shani,
[1015.12] you have made a mistake and 
then you are shouting at me?
[1018.28] it is people like you who pressurize 
people to cover their mistakes.
[1021.88] Pathetic.
[1023.32] Listen to me carefully today,
[1025.36] if I ever saw you at the shop ever again,
[1027.80] I will break your legs.
[1029.28] I Will break your hands if you 
even try to touch me,
[1032.16] let alone breaking my legs.
[1033.40] What will you do?
[1034.92] You didn’t leave our honor 
in the neighborhood,
[1037.48] at least let us work with honor.
[1038.96] Hey, hey what happened? Ramsha,
[1042.04] you go to your room, go,
go to your room.
[1044.68] Shani, look my child, 
if there is anything,
[1047.20] if there is a problem 
you can talk to me son.
[1049.16] Aunt, what should I talk to you about 
you cannot even control your daughter,
[1052.08] if you would have controlled her 
we wouldn’t have to see this day today.
[1054.28] Enough Shani!
[1056.96] Tell me what is it? tell me?
[1059.04] Mom, ask her the one 
who is standing here.
[1061.32] She went to the shop humiliated me,
humiliated dad,
[1065.32] she was asking us for the accountability
 of the shop.
[1066.48] So then why should I ask for it?
[1068.04] I shouldn’t even ask for what is my right?
 It is my father’s shop,
[1070.84] I will take the accountability of 
every penny from you.
[1073.24] Your father is dead, 
do you understand?
[1077.84] But I am alive,
[1079.56] and until I am alive I will take accountability
 of each and everything,
[1082.32] I have all the right on the shop.
[1084.52] Shut your rubbish, do you understand?
[1086.16] I won’t get scared of you shouting, 
do you understand?
[1088.92] Sister in law, take her from here.
[1091.28] And Shani, you also, go, go inside.
[1092.96] Mom, if she says a word more, 
I am telling you it won’t be good for her.
[1095.60] I don’t even expect anything good
from a pathetic man like yourself.
[1098.84] Shani?
[1217.04] Very good, very very good,
[1219.64] in fact, what I say is that not just one slap, 
uncle should have slapped him twice.
[1222.80] Quiet.
[1224.76] Now I don’t even want to hear 
you voice in this house.
[1231.00] Had there been any less havoc in here
[1233.32] that you want more of the storm?
[1239.60] And what was the need for you 
to go to the shop?
[1242.32] If you hadn’t gone to the shop, 
all this wouldn’t have happened.
[1245.52] Mom, both of them has been lying 
to us over and over again
[1248.12] and you are telling me 
I shouldn’t go there?
[1250.76] So what did you get?
[1252.00] What did you get by going to the shop?
[1254.36] Truth.
[1255.76] The truth has unfolded.
[1261.16] If I hadn’t gone there,
[1263.16] I and you would have never found this out.
[1269.84] Mom, we are so worried here, 
there is no money for my fee,
[1273.64] and forget about the fee,
[1276.36] we don’t even have the money 
for your medicine.
[1282.48] Do you know that uncle is getting 
good income from the shop
[1288.12] but he doesn’t have anything 
to give to us.
[1291.64] It is my father’s shop, 
I have all the right over it, mom
[1296.12] and uncle has captured it.
[1299.32] Ramsha, he didn’t capture it.
[1301.56] Mom this is called capturing,
[1304.00] all the income that is being made is 
going in uncle’s pocket.
[1306.60] We are not getting anything,
[1308.72] not even the money to fulfill our needs,
[1312.52] it is the limit mom,
[1313.60] you are acting like you know nothing 
even after seeing everything.
[1336.80] Whatever it is,
[1339.16] Anwar you shouldn’t have raised your 
hand on your grown up son like this
[1342.56] that too in front of everyone.
[1344.36] So what else should have I done?
[1346.64] What should have I done?
[1350.96] Didn’t you see
[1353.24] how Shani was misbehaving 
with sister in law?
[1361.44] What was the need to get 
in fight with Ramsha?
[1371.44] I thought that I will come home
[1373.92] and talk to sister in law in my own way
[1377.64] but the he ruined the whole matter.
[1381.92] He is one hell of an emotional being,
[1383.80] your son has no brain at all.
[1393.24] What do you guys think?
[1395.04] Is it easy to handle the shop alone 
after the death of brother?
[1401.32] If I would have talked to sister in law my 
own way she must have understood as well.
[1411.88] It is a strange matter,
[1413.60] I work hard and then I ma the bad guy.
[1416.40] Let bygones, be bygones,
[1419.04] why are you worrying now?
[1421.76] No, no, no, no,
[1425.24] I am not worried,
[1432.00] whatever I want will happen,
[1441.40] I know how to turn the game in my favor,
[1447.64] I am an old player,
[1450.76] what player to move where and when,
[1456.28] no one knows that better than me,
[1460.88] to hell with sister in law and her daughter.
[1468.44] I had to raise my hand on my grownup son,
[1473.16] I wanted to ask him if it hurt bad?
[1480.48] What happened was wrong.
[1483.72] I was helpless,
[1486.44] I had to do it.
[1507.32] Listen to me, Shani,
[1510.32] you will apologize to sister in law.
[1515.00] I won’t apologize.
[1516.64] why don’t you try to understand,
[1522.44] remember Shani,
[1524.76] if you don’t apologize … 
So what?
[1527.80] You will hit me?
[1529.36] Hit me but I won’t apologize.
[1535.12] Do remember
[1537.12] that your brain will destroy you one day and
along with that it will ruin us as well,
[1545.80] listen to me and understand,
[1549.20] sit there, sit down.
[1561.80] Look Shani,
[1563.48] try to understand the sensitivity of the matter.
I should understand?
[1567.32] She needs to understand,
[1569.04] the fool who is trying to take us 
in pressure.
[1572.76] What?
[1575.12] What is she doing?
[1578.04] How did she put pressure on us?
[1580.72] She just said that shop is hers,
[1583.44] that business belongs to her, 
it is her fathers,
[1586.16] nothing belongs to us, 
so what is wrong in it?
[1590.32] What is wrong in it?
[1593.08] That business is her and even that 
shop belongs to her, her father.
[1600.96] Fear that day,
[1602.52] she was just asking for the accounts
 of the shop today,
[1605.84] in future she will ask the custody 
of the same shop
[1609.68] and things won’t stop here Shani,
[1613.44] who does this house belong to 
where you roam freely?
[1617.28] Where you talk loudly? 
Who does this house belong to?
[1620.00] Her,
[1621.60] her mother, her father,
[1623.84] nothing belongs to your father,
[1628.20] if she throws her out of here,
[1631.16] you won’t get anything, 
I won’t get anything either,
[1634.36] we will be empty handed, empty.
[1643.20] That’s why listen carefully to 
what I am saying,
[1646.92] it is very important for you 
to marry Ramsha.
[1653.08] My child, once you get married 
to Ramsha,
[1656.48] and she becomes your wife,
[1658.44] so everything that is hers will be yours,
[1661.12] you will be the owner,
[1663.84] that is why whatever I am saying,
[1666.40] just consider it with cool mind on it,
[1669.32] my child, if apologizing for a bit 
will make our life,
[1675.00] if it will bring us benefit
[1677.60] then what is the harm in it?
[1711.20] Are you mad?
[1713.76] You know very well that I have 
no interest in you Shani,
[1720.92] I can go through the pain of being 
dishonored but a trouble like yourself,
[1725.12] may God never write such fate for anyone.
[1729.40] I won’t even marry you if you are 
the last man in this world.
[1743.48] Aunt, I am embarrassed,
[1747.16] I shouldn’t have done that, God knows 
what happened to me,
[1751.04] I got angry
[1752.52] but I promise you that 
I will never do this again.
[1760.76] Shani, I feel like giving you a tight slap.
[1766.52] Hey, enough Anwar,
[1770.72] he is just a kid, he made a mistake,
[1773.60] I have forgiven him, you also just let it be 
and forgive him.
[1778.44] Sister in law this is your greatness 
that you are saying that
[1783.16] else trust me,
[1786.04] he has embarrassed me.
[1795.80] I thought that once I collect some money
[1799.04] I will give it to you all together so that 
it could be of some use to you
[1801.88] because you don’t know where does 
the money go these days
[1804.92] but I am very happy,
[1807.56] Daughter Ramsha has done a huge favor,
[1810.28] she did the right thing by making me realize,
[1813.04] I have realized sister in law
[1820.04] and I will assure you sister in law
[1822.04] that there will be no injustice with you
in this house ever,
[1827.24] everything will be the exact same like it 
used to be when brother Sajid was here,
[1832.00] if God wills, just relax.
[1839.00] What are you doing Salma?
[1843.56] Get up and make tea,
[1846.00] we will have the evening tea 
with sister in law today,
[1848.52] go Salma, go, and listen, 
hold this money,
[1855.60] go and get piping hot snacks 
from Iqbal’s shop,
[1860.12] sister in law you know how much 
our daughter Ramsha likes snacks
[1864.40] and if the snacks are from Iqbal’s shop,
[1866.96] the taste of the evening tea gets doubled.
[1869.60] Go and bring it, good boy.
[1874.72] Sister in law,
[1876.32] it’s just that I don’t know how to thank you 
for forgiving my child,
[1880.32] you have won my heart, 
you did me a favor.
[1882.76] Hey, Anwar, let it be,
[1886.40] Shani is like my son too.
[1889.24] That’s it. I will get water for you.
[1918.68] Afnan,
[1919.80] I wanted to talk to you about something,
[1922.32] I want you to tell mom that you don’t want 
to get married so soon.
[1931.12] Alizey, you think I am a fool
[1934.92] that I should listen to such 
foolish demand from you?
[1938.20] Afnan, mom will not listen to me,
[1940.68] she will agree if you convince her.
[1943.48] Please talk to her about it.
[1945.28] I will not talk to her about anything 
like that please don’t force me.
[1951.64] Not even for me?
[1955.52] For you?
[1958.84] Are you serious Alizey?
[1962.64] Usually girls say that marry me 
for my sake,
[1967.56] they cry, they beg,
[1969.84] they request and you are telling me 
not to marry you for your sake?
[1975.80] It’s unbelievable.
[1977.28] Afnan, you are very selfish. 
I am selfish?
[1980.80] You are selfish,
[1983.20] who just care about her own life, 
her career,
[1985.08] her social circle and her success
[1987.44] but where am I in all this, Alizey? 
So what?
[1991.24] Look if I will be strong and 
independent,
[1993.88] it’s good for both of us,
[1995.48] you will be so happy 
to see me as well.
[1997.60] I don’t want anything from it.
[2001.24] Afnan, are you going to refuse mom? 
I won’t talk to her and that’s it.
[2020.96] Mom,
[2022.92] you said yes to uncle?
[2025.68] Ramsha, Shani has changed a lot, 
my child.
[2032.04] Do you know he even took me 
to the hospital yesterday.
[2036.00] Mom, just because he took you to 
the hospital means he has changed?
[2043.08] What is wrong with you mom?
[2044.76] What is this way that you have figured out 
to judge someone?
[2049.12] Look Ramsha,
[2050.56] Shani and Anwar has realized their mistake,
my child
[2058.68] and Anwar has kept his word,
[2062.04] he hasn’t given e any chance 
to complain by far,
[2069.24] Anwar is regularly giving me money now
[2076.08] and he comes and properly tells me 
all the accounts of the shop.
[2079.88] Hey, he is even taking care of our expenses,
[2083.60] I have no complaints from him, my child.
[2087.88] Tell me something?
[2089.52] They are our family, right?
[2095.00] If we won’t trust them then 
who else will we trust?
[2098.16] Just let it be mom,
[2099.80] uncle Anwar can change so quickly?
[2101.96] It is impossible,
[2103.76] I know him very well, 
he is making us fool.
[2108.44] Such mistrust is not healthy, my child.
[2116.32] And I have to trust someone with you
[2120.12] then why not Shani? He is family.
[2128.16] Look, my child,
[2130.20] just forget whatever happened.
[2137.52] Once you get married to Shani
[2140.68] you will stay here in front of 
my eyes in this house,
[2148.12] whatever has happened,
[2149.68] it is a blessing to get Shani’s proposal 
for marriage after that, my child.
[2265.52] I want you to tell mom that you don’t
want to get married so soon.
[2273.04] Alizey, you think I am a fool
[2276.88] that I should listen to such 
foolish demand from you?
[2282.20] Afnan, mom will not listen to me,
[2284.76] she will agree if you convince her.
[2287.36] Please talk to her about it.
[2289.28] I will not talk to her about anything 
like that please don’t force me.
[2294.36] Afnan, you are very selfish.
[2295.88] I am selfish?
[2297.76] You are selfish,
[2300.04] who just care about her own life,
her career,
[2302.36] her social circle and her success
[2304.52] but where am I in all this, Alizey? 
So what?
[2308.44] Look if I will be strong and 
independent,
[2310.80] it’s good for both of us.
