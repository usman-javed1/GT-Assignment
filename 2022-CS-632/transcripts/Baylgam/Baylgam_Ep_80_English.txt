Tell me Alizeh, 
did you not tell everyone that they kidnapped me in front 
of you and took me? What is she saying? I don’t know what stories 
you are making. Alizeh, we were in the car, some people 
parked their car in front of you. Those people pulled me, dragged me, 
they kidnapped me in front of you. You were stopping them too. Did you not tell anyone anything? Why are you not telling anyone?
Please, don’t lie. I am saying the right thing. Something has happened to you, 
I don’t know why you are lying. Look girl, you are responsible for whatever
 you have done. Don’t even try to drag my daughter
 in this matter. In reality, because of 
your failed loves, you have become a mental patient. No need to do this drama 
in front of us. I am not doing a drama, you and your daughter are 
doing the drama. You two are lying. Are you not ashamed to say all this Alizeh? I am not making up stories, she is. Fine, let’s believe for a minute 
that you got kidnapped. Then the kidnappers let you go
 just like that? They didn’t demand money? What do you think we are mad here? We have lost our mind? Be quiet. Afnan, these two are lying. I was kidnapped in front of Alizeh, 
Afnan. She is lying. You believe me, why would I lie 
about all this? I was really kidnapped. Afnan, I was kidnapped in front of her eyes and I got away from them 
with difficulty. She is lying, believe me Afnan. Whatever she is saying is not true. Whatever I am saying Afnan is true. Be quiet. If you take my daughter’s name again, then I will cut your tongue. Cutting my tongue will not 
change the truth. The truth will remain what it is. What else can hypocrite and 
liar like you do? That’s it. You have said enough. They are not making up the story, 
you are. Like always you are telling us 
a false story. Ramsha. What was the need for you 
to do all this, Ramsha? That’s it, I have had enough. 
There is no place for you in this home. Get lost from here. Stop, Ramsha. I know well she went from here 
by her will. I had doubts on her earlier, She was busy on the phone for hours, I am sure she went with that boy. Afsheen, Ramsha is not such a girl 
and you keep on talking. I am sure she is in some difficulty and if you don’t want to support me, 
then don’t. I will go myself. Brother, why do you forget her past? If you tell the police her past, 
then they too will laugh at us. We will get defamed for no reason. Why do you forget brother that she ran away from her home 
like this as well. Look, God forbid, 
if Ramsha had an accident, then we would have gotten 
a call from the hospital. Or if she was kidnapped, then the kidnapper would have called
 for extortion. Now brother whatever the situation 
there is right now, it is clear from it that she went by her will. Do you also not believe me, uncle? Do you also feel that I am lying? Did I run away from this home
on purpose? Without caring about your respect? Do you too also consider me 
responsible like everyone else? Why are you quiet uncle?
 Answer me. If you feel that I am responsible 
then punish me. I can tolerate all punishment. But I cannot tolerate you
 being upset, uncle. I am unable to tolerate you 
being upset. I saw my parents, my home, my well-wisher, 
everything in you uncle. Uncle, you taught me how to live. You gave me a reason to live. I was walking on a dark path, you showed me light. Seeing you I have learned 
how to love God. You taught me how to love God, 
uncle. You have taught me what relation 
a person has with their Lord. I am not the Ramsha 
from earlier, uncle. I have changed. Believe me. I beg you, don’t look away from me. Forgive me. Believe me.
 Please… Ramsha, I believe you. I believe you more than myself. They are liar. Alizeh lied to me. Alizeh and Afsheen will fall so low, 
I couldn’t imagine it. They have done injustice to you. I called you my daughter and I couldn’t even take care of you. Uncle. Are you fine, uncle? Are you fine? Take me to my room. Come on, uncle. Come on. Come on. Careful, uncle. Afnan. Afnan. What happened? Uncle is really unwell, 
you please come quickly. What?
Yes. Where has this girl brought 
my brother to. Since this girl has come 
to my brother’s life, he has one foot in the hospital,
 one at home. I feel this girl is a bad omen. First her father died, 
then her mother. Now there is just a relation left 
in name and she made it reach this point. God give my brother life, 
give him health. My brother is really respectful. That is why he couldn’t tolerate 
the sorrow, the pain she gave him. You know people are right, you should keep the person
 in the place they deserve. I made brother understand so much, that this is not her place. Don’t give her so much respect. But no, who listens to me. Alizeh never let brother’s head 
bow down. She did as he said. I was tired of making brother understand, but no one listens to me. Brother Bashir. Yes, madam. Tell the driver to take out the car, 
I have to go to the hospital. Yes, better. Alizeh, you are going to the hospital,
I will come with you. Not at all. Mama has clearly said that 
I don’t take you to the hospital. Alizeh, I just have to meet uncle 
for two minutes. I will meet him and just come back. I have been calling Afnan for a long time,
even he is not answering my call. That is really good. Afnan didn’t pick up your call. You know what this means? That he doesn’t believe 
anything you say. If you have even a little shame, then don’t call Afnan after today. Alizeh. Alizeh, please, 
take me along too. Oh my God, my Lord, I want to talk to You. I have no one in this world 
apart from You. No one is ready to listen to me. You listen to me. Oh God, I have never complained to You, I will not complain to you even today. But I have just one support
 in this world, my uncle. You give health to my uncle, 
make him better. I want to meet him. I want that he gets healthy 
and comes back home. You give health to my uncle, my Lord. Make him better. What are you doing here? I came to meet uncle. Don’t take brother’s name. You have no relation with him. If you had a relation, then you would have cared 
about that relation. I will not let you meet him. Didn’t you understand? I will not let you meet my brother. If you had a relation with him, you would have cared 
for that relation. But no, you are the one who made 
brother unwell. Because of you, today, 
brother is in this condition. Don’t take his name from your tongue. Let me meet uncle. I will not leave without meeting him. No. this is not our home, 
this is a hospital. You didn’t care for our respect 
at home, at least care for it in the hospital. For the sake of brother, 
go from here. Leave. What is the point of sitting here,
 mama? I would say let’s go home 
and rest for a while. I am very sleepy. Alizeh, what is wrong with you? Brother is in such a serious condition. So what? Us sitting here won’t make him better. I would say we would go home and we will rest a little and 
if you want to pray for him, you can do it from home too. No Alizeh, Afnan is alone here. If we go home, he will feel it, he will not like it. Mama, what difference does it make
if one person sits here or two. Uncle won’t get better like this. I would say we should take 
turns and rest, so that all of us stay fresh, and Afnan is here right now. In fact, I will also make him understand that we will come and 
stay one by one, so that if uncle has an issue,
then all of us are available. Or else if all of us sit like this, 
we will all get unwell, and then we will come in the morning,
there will be no issue. Let’s go. Yes, you are right about that, 
even I am really tired, but… Mama, that’s why I am saying 
we will go home. You too will rest for a while 
and me too. Okay fine, then I too will come along. I will go right now and come 
early in the morning. Okay, don’t worry, 
I will go inform Afnan, okay? Okay. Sir, please bring this medication 
from outside. Sure. Thank you. 
Thank you. Ramsha. You are still here? I had told you, I will not leave without seeing uncle. What? This means you are here 
since last night. You didn’t go home? After getting insulted so badly, 
you still didn’t go. You are really stubborn. When a person loves, 
they become stubborn. In fact, you have to become stubborn. Because when you love someone 
with a true heart, then being stubborn is necessary 
because... when someone breaks your heart, then you can bear all that strongly. So that you can tolerate it. The condition my father is in today 
is because of you. If you feel that like always 
saying these big things you will melt my heart, 
then this will not happen. I know, you don’t have a heart in your chest, 
you have a stone. And I am not interested 
in colliding with this stone. Do you understand? I understand. I will tell the driver to drop you home. You just said I am really stubborn, so I will not go anywhere 
without seeing uncle. You pray. Pray with your heart,
God will accept it. She is my sister, 
may God give her health. Don’t worry. Whenever your heart feels low, call out to Him. 
He listens, He knows it all. 
He lives in your heart. Talk to Him about what is in your heart. He listens. He listens to everyone. Here you go. Eat it. A person gets angrier 
when they are hungry. Afnan don’t think that I care for you 
or I worry for you, that’s why I brought you food. If you don’t eat, you will get unwell. And right now, all of us cannot 
afford you being unwell. Uncle needs you. You being fine is necessary. Thank you for telling me all this. But you don’t need to worry 
about me at all. I told you I am not worried about you. I just care for uncle. That is why I am saying that you take care of your health, 
because uncle needs you. Here you go.
