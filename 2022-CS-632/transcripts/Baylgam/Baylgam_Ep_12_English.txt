Hello. Afnan, how are you? Yes, where are you? Me. I am at a shoot. Shoot of what? This is a surprise for you, 
you will find out in some time. You know Ramsha, I must admit. You are not as stupid that I thought, in fact, you are stupider than that. I am just getting the first shoot 
done right now. You wait and watch that I will do so many shoots, 
I will become so famous, that the whole world will be after me. Are you out of your mind? You think it is so easy to enter this field? The shine of this field looks 
good from a distance or else it is as difficult as breaking
 the stars and bringing them. What are you saying? You consider me your friend, right? So I am telling you as a friend. Here people use each other. You are really naïve, innocent, 
you wont understand them. No one is there to support you either. Either you had come from a filmy background
 it would have been fine. But right now you don’t even know 
who is sincere with you and who isn’t. Hey, Afnan, you are worried 
for no reason. You know, where I came for the shoot, the owner is your friend’s cousin. She is your friend’s cousin, 
not your cousin. How can you trust him? Madam, shall we start? 
Sir Shahmir is going to come. Sure. Afnan, I will talk to you later, 
I am a little busy. Ramsha, listen to me. What is she doing? Is the wiring work here done? Yes, yes, sir, just a little is left. 
We are doing it. It is almost done. Okay, after this come inside and 
check as well, there is a wiring issue. Don’t worry sir, I will come inside
 and check. Thank you. Give me the plyer and go inside 
and check what work is left. Switch on the light and tell me. I will check. Shani, where are you going? Stop. Did you fix the light or not? Listen to me. Work is left to be done. Shani. Shani. Shani, one minute. One minute.
 One minute, listen to me. Shani, please. Shani. Shani, 
I am so sorry. Shani. Please don’t tell anyone 
anything at home, please. Swear on your mother. In fact, don’t swear on aunt. 
You had loved me Shani, for the sake of that love. Please, don’t tell anyone anything. Really? Today you remember 
that love you never accepted. And just for your advantage 
you are swearing on it. No, I accept I made a big mistake 
that I rejected your love. See, I am accepting my mistake, right? Please don’t tell anyone at home. If they find out, papa will kill me. And after all, I just came because a friend of mine
 forced me. In fact, I wont get it done in my life 
again in future. Please Shani. I promise. You go home, I will take a rickshaw 
in two minutes and two minutes. Shani, I am coming. I will get a rickshaw and come home. You wont tell anyone, Shani. Shani. What have I done? Who is this girl? My new model. Maybe you would have seen her video. She is really viral by the name 
of Shopping girl. Coincidentally she is in the studio right now. You know how much I need such girls. They want fame and I want profit. Anyway, you tell me, do you know her? I don’t know what Shani would have 
told everyone. I hope he has not told anyone. It is not possible that 
he will not tell anything. Maybe he said nothing. If I think like this, I will really go mad. You know, I feel Shani would have 
stayed quiet, or else mama or papa would have 
called me. In fact, not call, papa would have 
come to get me himself. God, oh God, please keep 
Shani’s mouth shut. Oh God, thank you. This means Shani didn’t tell anyone 
anything at home or else all hell would have broken loose
 till now. Stop there. Greetings, papa. Where are you coming from? From university. I don’t believe that the daughter who I trusted blindly is standing 
in front of me. But you kept on deceiving me. What are you looking at? What do you think? If no one tells us, 
then we wont find out and you will keep on deceiving us? How dare you go? And you? You are responsible for this action of hers. I had told you not to take her into showbiz, but you took her side and took her. Whatever she is doing today is 
because of you. Believe me, I know nothing 
about her shoot. Had I known, then is it possible that
I wouldn’t have told you? Papa, mama is right. Mama knows nothing about this. 
It was… Great. The daughter is doing what she wants, 
and the mother doesn’t even know. Papa, don’t say that. I just went for a magazine shoot 
and nothing else. and Shani told you all this
 with exaggeration, right? I will deal with you later. One minute, you still don’t realize your mistake? You have no embarrassment? Instead of you admitting your mistake, instead you are screaming on others. What was the need for you to go there? Papa, listen to me. See it is a small magazine shoot, and they were saying that pictures will get published in the magazine,
nothing more than that. You know, they gave me a cheque. See. See, this, they gave me a cheque of 
three hundred thousand for a small photoshoot. Papa, look at this. Such a big cheque for a 
small photoshoot. Look at this. Afnan. Coffee. I made it myself. Afnan, what is the issue now? Now I have even reduced the days, I am only going for fifteen days. Here, you are making this face, 
upstairs mama is not talking to me. Afnan, listen to me, if you feel that you making this will 
stop me from going, then you are mistaken. 
Yes, I know and I am not mistaken. I know well, no matter how much 
I stop you, you wont stop. So just go. Afnan, why are you doing this, buddy? Try and understand. Me going like this will not 
achieve anything. I will go there and I wont be able 
to focus on work. Then why are you going? Is someone forcing you? Don’t go. What happened? Afnan, can you not even let me go 
for my happiness? See this is really important for me. Okay fine, go. Really? Afnan, I love you a lot. Yes, I can see how much you love me. I know you are upset right now, 
but you will get fine. I will convince you. Okay, have your coffee, I made it myself. Thank you. How is the coffee? Just like you. Bitter. No problem, drink it. Papa tore my entire cheque 
into small pieces. Really? Your papa just tore the cheque, I wanted to cut you into pieces and 
throw you away on what you did. Really? Then beat me. Beat me as much you want. Because you people don’t know 
anything better. Be quiet Ramsha. 
Be quiet for God’s sake. If you say another work, I will teach you a lesson 
you will not forget. Elder mama, you please go inside. As long as you stand here, 
you will get angry at her. Hey, if I don’t get angry, 
what do I do, Annie? Did you not see what she did. Because of these actions of her, 
her father insulted me badly and only I know. We think that our daughter 
is going to study. We have no idea 
what she is up to. I have thought about it. 
I have decided. The first proposal the wedding planner
 brings, I will say yes to it and send her away 
from this home. Hey, who will sit here guarding her. It is enough. I was trying to make you understand, 
Ramsha. You don’t listen…
You be quiet. All this happened cause of your brother. Had he shut up then I wouldn’t have had to face insult 
in front of everyone like this. Ramsha, you try and understand, had brother not showed them, then they would have found out
 some other way. Really?
Imagine, had the magazine come home, then? Really? How would the magazine 
come home? Huh? The newspaper has never come at home,
 a magazine would come? And would the magazine come 
outside the door and knocked, and said I am the magazine, 
open the door. I have pictures of Ramsha inside me. Stupid. Go from here. I have found all mad people 
in this home. See, this, they gave me a cheque of 
three hundred thousand for a small photoshoot. Such a big cheque for 
a small photoshoot. Look at this. You are a really shameless man, 
you know. You have no shame at all. Do one thing, why don’t you drown 
in this tea and die. What shame are you talking about? You should be ashamed that you were ruining
the respect of this home. Whatever I was doing was my personal matter.
 Do you understand? Why did you get upset? And I had requested you so much that please don’t tell anyone, 
but you did all that you could. You are an imbecile. That’s why. Shut your mouth.
 I am not a liar like you. You are a liar. 
You are  really big liar. You lied that you love me, 
you like me. Hear me out clearly, the ones who love cover someone’s flaws, they don’t ruin respect in public. Whatever I did , 
I did it for your betterment. Look at this. Even now you are lying. 
You are lying. Whatever you did was your own benefit. That love of yours is selfish, 
and even this hatred is selfish. Whatever you do is for your own self. You enjoyed getting praised and 
getting me insulted of everyone. I got you insulted? Get your mind fixed. Whatever was done with you, 
was done by you, yourself. Understand this. You don’t have shame, 
at least care for us. I don’t know what nonsense my friend 
was speaking about you I couldn’t even look him in the eyes. Hey, I have not taken up the responsibility
for everyone’s respect, understand? What are you talking about shame? If you were so respectable, 
you wouldn’t be arguing with me, you would have gone and 
slapped your friend on his face. Shameless! I really miss you, I cannot even focus on work. Please Alizay, come back. Liar. If this was true, you wouldn’t have 
gone for so many days. You know how lonely this home 
seems without you. So much silence, sadness. Ramsha. 
Yes? Child, quickly finish your breakfast, your father will drop you at the university 
and he will pick you too Why? Me and Annie go together, then why would I go with papa? Stop worrying about Annie. Shani is there, he will drop her 
and also bring her back. Fine, I will go in a rickshaw, but I will not go with papa. He is already upset, 
he will insult me all the way. Now you talk to your papa 
about this yourself that whether you have to go 
with him or not. Now quickly finish your breakfast,
he is waiting. I will talk to him. 
You keep me scared all the time. Come on, what happened? 
We are getting late. Come quickly. Yes. Come quickly, 
I have to go to the shop. What is this? 
Be quiet, he will get angry. You don’t worry. I just spoke to Shahmir, he said that a second cheque
 will be made for you, but it will take some time. Don’t worry. Okay, I am getting late for class, I will talk to you later. Okay? Bye. Ramsha, first you end your friendship with that girl. First she drives you mad and 
then you drive us mad. Have I ever asked you to end your friendship
 with them, end your friendship with her? No, Annie. At least you don’t do all this with me. Man, this is your issue. Every time I sit down to make you understand, 
you get angry. Stop it Annie, I am losing my mind right now anyway. It would be better that 
you don’t talk to me. Papa insulted me so  badly on the way, 
you cannot imagine. Thank God, elder papa only insulted you, he didn’t stop you from going 
to university. So that your education doesn’t 
get disturbed. You know if my papa was there, 
I am telling you the truth, Ramsha. Firstly, he would have killed me. Then he would have stopped me 
from going. This is elder papa’s love that 
he ignores every mistake of yours. Ignore? Seriously? Is this how you ignore it? He taunted me a hundred times, 
he said a hundred things. He has stopped me from coming 
and going. You don’t ignore things like this. I wish you could understand 
the feelings of elder papa. It would be better that 
you leave from here. I am losing my mind already. Okay don’t get upset. Mama. Greetings. 
Greetings. Greetings. 
Greetings. This is our Ramsha, she just came from university. Actually,
I had told sister Bushra for the evening. Maybe she forgot to tell you. Yes, you are right. Actually we have to go 
to another place, that is why we came before time. Your daughter is really pretty. Yes. Go, Ramsha, go, 
change and come. Sure. You people have something. Sure. Sure. Sister in law, Ramsha is here. Okay, I will see. Greetings. Greetings. Brother, you usually recite Quran after Fajr, 
then at this time? I was just memorizing my lesson. Lesson? What do you mean, brother? Afsheen, I recited the Quran 
to Haji Abdul Majid, there were a lot of mistakes. I thought I should make him teach me. He will come after Isha to teach me. Now you will learn the Quran
 in this age? There is no age restriction 
of reciting the Quran and I would tell you that reciting the Quran 
with the right pronunciation is the right of the Quran. There is a Hadith that says, the best amongst you is the one 
who learns the Quran and teaches it. It is God’s blessing, whatever age you
get the understanding and guidance. Yes, you are right. Okay sit, I had to talk to you 
about something. Yes, brother? When will Alizay, come? I spoke to Alizay, she will be back in a few days. May she come back safely. I wanted to say that going on such a long journey without 
a Mehram is not an action that is liked, so you are her mother, 
be careful in future. Yes, brother, in future you won’t get a chance
 to complain. Okay, you go, 
that’s all I had to talk about. Sure. Afnan, did you talk to Mr. Jamil? Yes. Yes. Yes, I spoke to Mr. Jamil. The files… Hey, no you spoke to him, it is fine. Thank God. Mama, you should have asked me 
before inviting them. Do you tell me before doing anything? No, right? Then why would I take permission 
from you? I am your mother. You are lying. Everything that I have done in my life, I do it after asking you and the reason I didn’t ask you 
about the shoot is because I was sure that you and papa 
won’t give me permission. That’s the only reason I didn’t tell you. Ramsha, you have done 
what you had to. Now you will do what we tell you to do. No, no, mama, don’t do this. 
It will be just with me. You are my mother, I am telling you I don’t want to 
get married right now, so I don’t want to get married. I told you this is not my decision, 
it is your father’s decision. Say whatever you want to, 
to your father. Go. Okay fine, then go tell papa that Ramsha doesn’t 
want to get married right now. Really? I go and talk to your papa? You will go talk to your papa yourself. Hey because of you I have become 
the bad person in the eyes of the people. Okay, so you have decided 
you won’t support me now. Hear one thing, I am not from amongst those people who give up even before the battle begins. Do you understand? Really? You too hear one thing as well, this is my home, not your shoot location, where you will stand and speak dialogues and after today, don’t say anything like this. Mama. I won’t get married. Ramsha, these are such pretty pictures. It doesn’t look like you. 
Right? I had told you, your face cut, and your talent will 
make you do wonders. You know Shahmir, he is getting 
a lot of calls from media. He has a friend, 
who is a big producer, he wants to cast you 
in his next serial. Me? Yes. 
In a drama serial? Yes, absolutely. You know how big of a producer he is. His dramas run on different channels. You must have heard his name, 
Danish Kamal. Yes. Yes. Every drama of his is almost a hit. He called? You know I spoke to him. If you are interested, I will talk to him. And he is ready to pay you well. Money too? How much money? The amount of one million rupees One million rupees? Oh my God, one million for one drama. Yes. Idiot, people earn much more than 
this in media. Tell me, if you are interested. If you are interested, then tell me, 
I will make you talk to him. Hmmm. I was sure uncle’s restrictions 
will increase. Mama, by the way, 
if Afnan didn’t say anything, then you could have said something, even you didn’t say anything. See, times have changed. I don’t know why you stand quietly
in front of him all the time. Say something. But Alizay, brother was right. that’s the issue mama, you find everything he says as right. You are already agreeing to 
so much he is saying, I feel after marriage you will ask me 
to breath if he allows me. Hey, but brother has never wanted 
something bad for you. Mama, when am I saying that 
he wants something bad for me? I know uncle thinks good for me, but there is a big difference between 
his and my thinking. He wants to take all the decisions
 of my life. But I cannot do that. 
I have my own thinking, I have my understanding, I want to 
take my own decisions, mama. And I don’t want to be dependent 
on anyone for any matter. I just want that the whole family 
understands this thing. Okay tell me, 
when are you coming back? I will be back in a few days. But you had said it will take fifteen days. So mama, let fifteen days be complete. Listen to me, hear one thing clearly, you will not stay there for 
more than fifteen days. Okay fine, mama. Okay, I am going to go prepare 
for my project, I will talk to you later. Okay. Bye. 
Bye. Bye. I think I should talk to papa. Papa will surely understand me. Papa, I… I wanted to talk to you about something. Yes, yes, go ahead. Papa, I…I… I don’t want to get married right now. I mean, I am studying right now I will have 
my final year exams. Because of that I don’t want to get married, so that my education doesn’t get disturbed. This sounds good coming from a person whose entire attention is on studies. But your attention is towards something else. Do I not know?
