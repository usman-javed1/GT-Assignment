What are you doing Afnan? What? Nothing. Just randomly. You tell? I feel so pity for Ramsha today. Just a few days ago she was so happy when her mom got back consciousness and now all of a sudden 
she passed away, I couldn’t even imagine what
 she must be going through. Mothers are so important, right? Even I lost my mother in childhood. The pain of losing a mother
 at such a young age, no one can know that better than I do. Uncle is very depressed too, he blames himself for all this though it was just an accident, Afnan only you can convince him. I have tried multiple times, I am so hurt looking at
 him in this condition but you know it very well that Dad is a very sensitive person, very God-fearing that is why it will take him 
some time to get normal. Yes, true that. Where is Dad though? Umm, he is in his room. He has asked Mom that 
no one should disturb me, he doesn’t want to meet anyone. Afnan? I was saying that I and you should go out somewhere. My heart feels so low after 
the entire routine of the day today, I was thinking to go out with
 you somewhere. I am so sorry Alizey, but I don’t feel like going out at all. I can understand. I completely understand whatever you are feeling, if we go out somewhere, your mind will be diverted too, let’s go somewhere. Thank you. Okay let’s go. Come. brother, I am getting 
breakfast served, come let’s have breakfast. Umm, call Ramsha for breakfast too. Tabassum went to her so Ramsha said she is not hungry, you come. You get the breakfast served, I will bring her. Look, no matter what I say, or any word or any comfort cannot heal your pain right now, these words are nothing 
in front of your grief, Ramsha, my child, trust me 
I can understand your pain. You are lying, you are lying, the pain and hell that 
I am going through right now, you cannot even feel that, I have lost my mother, just because of you, I have lost my mother because of you. Look my child, I was saying that… Enough! Enough! Just stay quiet. Do you know that you have everything, you have a house a 
family and everything and I, I just had a mother, I just had a mother left, you even took that away from me. You even took my mother away from me. You even took away my mother from me. My child, I admit it is my fault but… You didn’t commit any mistake, will I get my mother if you admit or not? Can my loss be recovered? My loss won’t be recovered, right? My mother won’t come back, right? No right? You have murdered my mother, you killed my mom,
 you are a murderer, you are a murderer. You have committed a murder. Just shut up! How are you talking to my dad? What I am saying is absolutely right, your father killed my mother. Shut your nonsense! Afnan, stay quiet. No dad, she shouldn’t have the audacity
 to talk in front of you. Why? Because I am telling the truth? You are unable to hear the truth, right? Because truth is bitter. All of you won’t be able to hear my truth, you all are my mother’s murderers. I will. What are you doing Afnan? Leave me. What is wrong with you all? Has anyone dared to talk to
 dad like this in this house ever? Do you think I am mad? I mean, she is talking to dad like this and you all are just 
watching this drama? Afnan? I am saying go away from here. Afnan, go if brother is asking you to go. Let’s go Afnan, let’s go. They took my mom away from me. they took my mother… Enough Afnan, its good uncle sent you to the room, why are you getting so 
hyper by the way? So what should I do? Didn’t you see how that girl 
was misbehaving with dad? She was talking to him 
in such loud tone and what didn’t she say to dad, she even called him a murderer. Tsk, Afnan? Try to understand her condition too, her mother has just passed away, I mean this is not the time we should tell her what 
is wrong and right. Didn’t you see uncle was even quiet? Dad’s silence gave her
 the audacity to misbehave with Dad so much else she is not worth it. And why are you telling me? Didn’t you see it for yourself with your own eyes how 
she was talking to Dad? Her tone? I felt like killing her. Afnan, you have gone mad. Yes I have gone mad, if that’s how it is then just 
consider me mad but let me tell you one thing, if she talks to dad in 
that tone ever again, I won’t tolerate it and 
I will do anything. What is wrong with you Afnan? You will not raise your hand 
on a girl, right? Okay, relax now, please calm down, it’s not that big of an issue. it is a huge issue for me. In the name of Allah, The Most 
Gracious and The Most Merciful. Afsheen, Ramsha didn’t 
come for food? Brother, I sent Tabassum to her she said she is not hungry. She will eat when she is hungry, you must relax and eat. And by the way, brother the 
misbehavior that she just did, do you think she can really sit with us and eat? I even told you earlier that she cannot adjust with us. And you have just watched 
it as well right now. What happened, uncle? Where are you going? To bring Ramsha. Dad, please? Look Dad if you will bring
 her here like this, she will never realize her mistake. It’s not her fault, we are the ones at fault. I won’t even call it a fault, but a sin. A person left this world 
squirming in pain and we were the reason behind it, if that’s not a sin then what is it? Greetings, may peace be upon you, may I come in, my child? Yes. Come, let’s have food. You have come here to
 call me to eat? Yes. I thought you, I thought you would ask 
me to leave your house. Why would I say that? That you should leave my house? You know what I am saying. What are you looking at, my child? I am looking that I misbehaved so much with you, I called you so many wrong names, said such things to you, called you my mother’s murderer and in return, you are behaving so 
politely with me? You are not asking me to
 leave this house, in fact, you are calling me to have food. Why? Because I am afraid of God. Come, have food. Come, my child. Come, good girl. Alizey, serve food to Ramsha. Where is the plate? Afnan, pass me the plate. Afnan? Afnan, pass the plate. Have it, have it my child, eat. She is such an ill-mannered girl, look at brother, he went to convince her, there is a limit to being down to earth, if her mother had this much life written, then what is brother’s fault in it? You tell me something? Who treats strangers like this? Hey, people just hit people and leave them dying on the road. But his girl doesn’t realize anything. Mom, I was thinking that do we not have anything to discuss
 anymore except Ramsha? Because when I go to Afnan he is always getting 
angry at Ramsha, when I go to uncle, he is worried for Ramsha, even you are just saying 
Ramsha, Ramsha, here, I am tired of listening 
to her name. do we not have anything
 else to talk about? Yes you are absolutely right, we are getting worried
 about such a useless thing and by the way, there is very less time left 
for your wedding now, I was thinking Alizey, why don’t you and Afnan go out 
for wedding shopping tomorrow? No mom, Afnan’s mood is not good, you start with your shopping, let Afnan get better and let his mood get fine then I will go and shop with him. Okay. My child, I admit it is my fault but… You didn’t commit any mistake, will I get my mother 
if you admit or not? Can my loss be recovered? My loss won’t be recovered, right? My mother won’t come back, right? No right? You have murdered my mother, you killed my mom, you are a murderer, you are a murderer. You have committed a murder. Just shut up! How are you talking to my dad? What I am saying is absolutely right, your father killed my mother. What have I done out of being emotional? I misbehaved so much with uncle, mom lived the life that 
was written for her, after all, what is uncle’s 
fault in all this. I have made a mistake, I should have talked to him like this. I should apologize to him. It is time for Fajr, I am sure he will go out for prayers, I should talk to him. Greetings, may peace 
be upon you, Ramsha, my child, what are you 
doing here at this time? Is everything all right? I wanted to talk top you 
about something important. Sir I will ask the driver to take 
out the car, you may come then. Yes. What is it, my child? I am here to apologize to you. Uncle, I have made such a huge mistake, I said so many wrong things to you, I don’t know what did 
I say to you out of angry, I don’t know what did I say, you just forgive me once, I am guilty from my heart. Hey? You do everything for God, right? Forgive me for God. Hey, what happened?
 What are you doing? God won’t even forgive me unless 
you forgive me from your heart, uncle, please forgive me. Look Ramsha, I am not upset with you, get up and sit, sit here, sit here. Forgive me. My child, you haven’t done anything. You didn’t do anything on purpose. When we get scared a person
 doesn’t know what they are saying but trust me, even I am very upset about 
sister Mehnaz’s death, May God grant her 
the highest ranks. To Him we belong and to 
Him shall we return, we all have to return 
back to Him. You, you just have patience, 
my child. Have patience. Uncle, do you know I have tried a lot to have patience
 somehow and I get peace, but my heart is not at peace, uncle. I beg you, help me, I am not getting peace, uncle. Look, God has said in the Holy Quran hey people of faith, seek help from patience
 and prayers, indeed, God is with the 
ones who are patient. You must offer prayers, you must talk to God, share your feelings in front of him, and present yourself to him. It is time for Fajr prayers, I must leave now. Uncle, you have forgiven me, right? Do you know that your tears are very precious, don’t shed them in 
front of human beings, you must present
 them in front of God. God has blessed 
you with the grief, you must pray for me, yeah? Pray for me. Oh Lord! Grant my mother 
a place in Jannah, Oh Lord, grant my mother highest ranks 
in Jannah, grant both my mom and 
my dad highest ranks in Jannah. Oh Lord, give me peace, my heart is so worried, bring peace in my life. Show me the right path. Allow me to offer prayers. Oh God, get me out of this trial, I am so helpless, I don’t have anything in my control. Help me, help me, Amen. Afnan? Hey? Oh I am sorry. Have you gone mad? Where is your concentration? You ruined my whole jacket. What is all this Afnan? You with that cheap girl? How can you even think 
like that about me? Oh so I can’t think like that? But I am watching everything Afnan. And I don’t like this at all that she should roam around you. Get her out of this house 
immediately. Send her to some shelter 
home, it is not my problem. Oh so what do you think 
I want her to stay in this house. So then do something. I will have to do something. Ramsha, leave all this, immediately go and pack your bags, you are going back to your house. Afnan? There is no need to say anything, just do as I say, pack your bags and go to dad and tell him you don’t want to live here, you are going back home, tell me the address of your house. Okay fine, you can speak but you will just tell me 
the address to your house, if you say anything else apart from it, I will be the worst. You won’t tell me like this, I will have to do something myself. I don’t have any house, I have already told that to your dad. What do you think that I will get trapped in all what
 you are saying, just like dad? I know you very well Ramsha, I know your cunningness 
very well that why have you come and sat here. You think that I will get scared of you? There is nothing like that and where do you used
 to live before here? On the moon? If you don’t have a house, if you don’t tell me your address, I will find it out myself. 
Just wait and watch. When fathers are alive, this land is also like a 
moon for daughters. After my dad passed away, that house is no longer mine, and the people who live 
there are not my own as well. What do you mean? Your dad passed away? Yes Afnan, you were so uninformed
 about me that you don’t even know this. And I, I lost everything in love with you. The love that you never
 even confessed and I was the one who 
suffered the punishment. Do you know? Do you know what 
your friend did to me? On my wedding day, he accused me of your love, he dishonored me 
in front of everyone, and my wedding got 
called off because of him. Look, I did tell him… Enough! You have spoken enough, I got such disgrace because 
of what your friend did, my father couldn’t bear that, he couldn’t tolerate it, that shock took my dad’s life. Whatever happened with 
my mother is all in front of you, Afnan. I lost everything in the
 process of loving you and what did you lose? Nothing. Nothing, Afnan. So what were you telling about Ramsha’s wedding? Yes, the story was left incomplete, then what else, who would just see everything 
and still go for it? When I told aunt, aunt humiliated them so much, we came back with the groom. Who are you calling now? I was calling Fahad but 
the call is not connecting. Fahad, Fahad has gone to Dubai. Dubai? When did he go to Dubai? 
He didn’t tell me about it. Yes, it has been so many 
days no since he left, he didn’t tell you? No he didn’t tell me. Okay, Anyway, I came to ask you if you are free today shall 
we go for shopping? I need to buy a few things. Why not? We will definitely go. Have I ever said no to 
you ever before? I don’t even have anything 
special to do today, and I will cancel the
 ones that I have. Okay. Why are you looking 
at me like this? do you need something? I am just looking at the fact that 
how lovely daughters are. You bring food for me 
daily in the morning, you take care of me all day, without even a frown on your face, you are the same girl who would get fed up if 
I ask you to do any work. But now, you look so mature. There is no need to say anything, just do as I say, pack your bags and go to dad and tell him you don’t 
want to live here, you are going back home, What do you think that I will get trapped in all 
what you are saying, just like dad? I know you 
very well Ramsha, I know your cunningness 
very well that why have you come and sat here. You think that I will get scared of you? There is nothing like that and where do you used 
to live before here? On the moon? If you don’t have a house, if you don’t tell me your address, I will find it out myself. 
Just wait and watch.
