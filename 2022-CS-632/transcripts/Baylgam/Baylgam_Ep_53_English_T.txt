[20.60] How can I let you get off?
[21.68] You think you are going to get
 off the car in this attire
[25.36] at this time of the night 
and I will let you?
[27.76] Really?
[30.24] I guess you have forgotten,
[39.40] you left me the very 
same way mid-way.
[42.84] Why do you worry if 
I am marrying Shani today?
[47.40] If I will stand on the road 
in the middle of the night,
[50.00] why do you worry?
[51.52] Why?
[53.88] Because,
[59.92] I know that I have made
 a huge mistake.
[63.96] I didn’t value you
 and your love
[67.28] but trust me
[70.20] since the day I realized it
[74.12] I have spent every 
moment in so much pain
[77.16] but,
[78.52] but that doesn’t mean you
[81.04] should ruin your life like this. Once,
[84.16] just once say it to me that
[87.56] you don’t want to do this marriage,
[89.32] I will support you and stand by you.
[91.12] What is wrong with you, Afnan?
[93.68] What are you even saying?
[95.12] Why are you causing 
me hurt and pain?
[102.96] Whatever you are saying
 is causing me pain, Afnan,
[105.36] for God’s sake, just keep quiet
[107.68] and take me to the hall,
[115.60] it has already been so late,
[118.20] if we get late anymore,
[119.48] I will once again get 
dishonored because of you.
[121.72] I won’t let any of that happen,
[123.40] I promise,
[125.52] just say the truth once,
[127.88] just gather the strength 
and tell me,
[129.12] I will stand by you
[130.16] and Shani won’t be able 
to say anything to you, I…
[131.68] What has happened to you?
[133.32] Why are you saying all this?
[135.36] Why are you hurting me
[136.60] and causing me pain
 by saying all this?
[138.32] Because I want to marry you.
[210.88] God has willed.
 God has willed.
[213.04] Wow, you look so handsome.
[214.48] Come on
[215.44] now give money to your 
sister for applying kohl.
[218.72] I will take complete Rs10,000
[220.96] 10,000?
[222.32] What happened? 
Did you skip a heartbeat?
[225.12] It is a happy occasion,
[226.60] don’t act miser,
[227.80] give her 10,000 today,
[229.24] and by the way
[230.48] you will get a lot of such 10,000s 
in your wedding money.
[233.28] Okay so no matter if you get 
the wedding money or not
[235.68] it is the right of sisters.
[236.96] Don’t make excuses, 
quickly give it to her.
[239.04] Okay, okay,
[240.60] take it,
[241.60] you will remember forever.
[242.68] 10,000, I will have to count.
[244.16] Wow.
[245.92] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10!!!
[255.32] Wow, wow, now
[256.32] give it to me, else you will lose it,
[258.16] it is the wedding occasion,
[260.08] you will drop it somewhere,
[260.76] you can take it from me later.
 Give it to me.
[261.92] I need them back.
[263.08] Give it to me,
[265.12] I will return all of these 
10,000 back to you.
[267.48] Now don’t get late,
[269.28] Mr. Qasim said don’t get late,
 be there in time.
[272.52] Yes, yes, you are 
absolutely right
[273.84] and Mr. Qasim is very punctual,
[277.00] he will get upset if we get late.
[278.20] Let’s go, let’s go.
[605.08] Where did you go?
[609.84] Nowhere,
[612.04] had some important work
 so I went to do that.
[617.28] Is that important 
work done then?
[624.20] No.
[632.08] Today, for the first time 
I got a deal in life that
[637.64] I was unable to fulfill.
[646.80] I failed.
[650.72] I came back empty handed.
[654.64] It’s okay Afnan,
[656.48] such things happen in business,
[666.04] please don’t get upset.
[675.00] Come,
[675.76] let’s go together and 
get a picture taken.
[677.80] No, no, I won’t come.
[679.80] No, Afnan, let’s go.
[681.32] I am telling you that I am
 not in the mood at all.
[683.44] Afnan, let’s go.
[726.88] Where are you going?
[728.68] Mr. Qasim has given the envelope
 of wedding money to Shani,
[732.52] the envelope seems quite
 heavy with money,
[737.64] let me go and check how 
much money is there.
[740.76] What is wrong with you?
[742.12] You will check the envelope
 in front of everyone?
[745.08] It will look bad, 
do it when you get home.
[747.44] Okay fine, do one thing,
[750.28] go ask Madam Afsheen
[751.92] to start the process
 of bidding farewell,
[752.60] we are getting late.
[1009.12] Finally, the fish has 
been caught in the net.
[1036.48] What was that nursery rhyme
 we would listen to as a child?
[1040.92] The fish one?
[1045.24] yes..
[1047.52] fish is the queen of water,
[1051.44] water is her life,
[1061.84] if you touch her, 
she gets scared,
[1075.92] if you take her out, 
she will die.
[1091.48] By the way, you know what?
[1093.28] Even I used to think as 
a child about what it meant,
[1098.40] today, I understand it.
[1138.96] Who is it at this time?
[1142.64] Who is it?
[1145.44] Shani?
[1147.48] Dad?
[1150.44] I will be right back, okay?
[1169.36] Yes dad?
[1170.72] Dude, actually
[1173.36] I wanted to say that
[1175.60] where is the wedding money?
[1178.96] I have it, do you need it right now?
[1181.16] Yes, bring it.
[1186.00] The envelope that
 Mr. Qasim gave,
[1187.52] is amongst them, right?
[1189.60] Go bring it, good boy. Quickly.
[1207.48] This was Mr. Qasim one, right?
[1209.08] Yes dad, these are all of them.
[1212.12] All of it?
[1212.88] yes, Dad, all of it,
[1214.56] let me know if you
 need anything else.
[1216.88] Shut the door.
[1220.76] Do it, do it.
[1254.12] Dad ruined the whole mood.
[1264.72] I mean is this the time to come 
and ask for the wedding money?
[1274.96] I mean,
[1276.24] he doesn’t trust his son,
[1278.16] would I spend all the 
wedding money at this time?
[1286.56] It is the limit.
[1288.72] He ruined the whole mood.
[1301.04] Anyway, forget it,
[1309.04] tell me something what 
were we talking about?
[1321.48] Do you know
[1322.80] I never even thought 
this would happen.
[1451.44] Ramsha.
[1456.40] Afnan.
[1459.36] Have a seat.
[1460.68] Umm hand.
[1461.92] Sorry.
[1468.80] Look at me.
[1471.76] Hey? Look at me.
[1475.52] yes?
[1479.12] If you weren’t important to me,
[1482.56] I wouldn’t be here today.
[1551.56] what is wrong with you, Afnan?
[1553.60] You love me,
[1555.04] if you won’t marry me,
[1556.16] then who else will you marry?
[1556.96] What is wrong with you?
[1559.28] I just talked to you nicely
 a couple of times,
[1560.72] does that mean 
I will marry you?
[1563.44] You didn’t just talk to
 me nicely a couple of times,
[1565.20] you have always
 taken care of me,
[1567.60] and this is not a friendship,
[1568.76] you have been 
concerned for me,
[1570.12] and you saved me from trouble.
[1571.52] I just showed sympathy 
towards you,
[1574.96] I thought that she is 
probably a naïve girl
[1576.88] who might need 
my guidance
[1578.92] and if I can make 
her a good friend
[1581.00] and guide her, save 
her from bad people,
[1583.28] so this was not love,
[1585.12] that doesn’t mean, 
I want to marry you.
[1593.36] You have gotten after me,
[1597.24] and why would I marry you?
[1600.36] Who are you?
[1601.72] What do you even have in you?
[1604.12] Did you leave your studies?
[1606.32] I have no clue about 
your family at all
[1609.72] and you,
[1610.84] you upload your 
videos on social media
[1613.24] so you can get famous
[1614.20] and I will marry you?
[1619.12] Hey, you even 
left your parents,
[1623.60] you didn’t even care 
about their honor,
[1626.20] how will you ever
 care about mine?
[1636.88] You didn’t value my sister,
[1641.20] she used to love you 
beyond any limits,
[1644.44] she was so sincere to you,
[1651.72] you didn’t believe her.
[1654.44] I know that she was carefree,
[1656.40] I know she was emotional
[1658.40] but for you, she was crazy for you.
[1664.76] She was very crazy about getting
 famous in showbiz and earning money,
[1672.48] but you were more than
 her craze for her.
[1751.88] Hey, wow,
[1753.20] God has willed, 
by the grace of God,
[1756.08] such an amazing breakfast?
[1758.96] You even made everything 
such early morning?
[1763.36] No, I didn’t make anything,
[1764.68] brother Qasim has sent all of this.
[1771.24] His servant dropped it.
[1773.28] Have a seat.
[1774.48] Oh wow. Amazing.
[1778.12] By the way,
[1779.92] Mr. Qasim is an amazing man,
 bravo to him,
[1783.88] he is not our relative
[1785.88] but look
[1787.12] how he is fulfilling
 the relationship.
[1791.28] Brother Qasim is a very nice man
[1793.56] else why would anyone do all this
 for a stranger these days?
[1798.32] What is wrong with you?
[1800.04] Mr. Qasim is a very elegant man,
[1803.24] he has made Ramsha his daughter,
[1805.60] now that he is fulfilling
 the relationship
[1807.56] why do you have 
a problem with that?
[1809.80] Hmm, I was just saying.
[1812.60] I don’t want to hear this from
 your mouth ever again,
[1815.56] you should be happy that
[1817.64] our son has become a son-in-law
 to such a rich man,
[1822.00] I have accepted Mr. Qasim as
 my son’s father-in-law from the heart,
[1825.84] you must do it too.
[1828.00] Good, now let’s begin.
[1831.36] Greetings.
[1832.60] Greetings. Annie,
[1834.40] my child, go and call
 Ramsha and Shani,
[1836.56] I have laid the breakfast 
it will get cold.
[1837.96] Go quickly.
[1838.72] okay Mom, I will call them.
[1841.08] Hey,
[1841.96] wait let the bride and groom come 
for whom this breakfast is here.
[1845.92] They will keep on coming,
[1847.44] bride and groom,
[1848.72] don’t know when they will come,
[1849.80] why should I let
 my breakfast get cold?
[1851.92] You must start too.
[1854.12] Oh wow, donut,
[1855.44] I have seen it after so long.
[1870.44] Afsheen,
[1872.16] ask Ramsha to check 
my blood pressure and sugar
[1875.12] because if I eat something 
first then she will say that
[1877.16] I ate without getting my blood 
pressure and sugar checked.
[1880.52] Call her.
[1882.28] Brother,
[1883.96] how can Ramsha come?
[1886.04] She is not here,
[1895.16] she has been married 
and gone to her home.
[1899.08] Oh yes,
[1900.96] look Afsheen, 
I didn’t remember,
[1910.76] she daily checks my blood 
pressure and sugar
[1915.20] and even gives me 
medicines punctually at night
[1917.96] so since she wasn’t there,
[1918.64] no one even gave
 me medicines.
[1926.84] Anyway.
[1929.36] Brother, I asked Alizeh to
 give you medicines,
[1938.80] I guess she was tired
[1940.36] so she must have forgotten.
[1948.44] You must ask Alizeh
 if you have any work.
[1952.60] Yes, I have to ask Alizeh,
[1955.40] Ramsha would do it herself.
[1976.88] I am getting the breakfast served, 
brother, you may come.
[1979.72] Okay, yes, get the breakfast served.
[2096.36] I, Ramsha,
[2099.40] do not want to marry you.
[2102.60] And how did you even think that
[2104.44] I, such a beautiful girl 
would marry you?
[2108.36] Ramsha, I love you.
[2110.16] To hell with your love,
[2112.84] I have shown you your 
place in person today,
[2117.08] next time if you even talk about love,
[2120.04] I will humiliate you in front of everyone
[2122.28] so that you will remember it for life.
[2125.76] You can only dream about
 a beautiful girl like me, Mr. Shani,
[2131.52] not in your life for real!
[2134.80] Do keep that in your mind!
[2156.92] Are you insane?
[2159.56] You know it very well that
[2161.24] I have no interest in you, Shani.
[2165.88] I can bear the pain of dishonor, but
[2167.72] a pain like you,
[2169.96] I pray that God never 
writes you in anyone’s fate.
[2174.28] Even if you will be the
 last man on the earth,
[2176.68] I still won’t marry you.
[2285.84] You didn’t remind me that
[2289.28] I had to give you the 
wedding night gift.
[2325.12] You look very pretty.
[2333.16] I don’t know how long 
I have been waiting for this day.
[2358.28] Your wedding gift.
[2373.16] This is your wedding gift.
