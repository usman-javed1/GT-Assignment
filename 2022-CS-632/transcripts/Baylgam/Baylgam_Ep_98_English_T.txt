[20.28] Oh, you wanted to discuss with me
[22.80] that you are marrying another girl?
[25.36] What do you think?
[26.72] I would have welcomed you 
in this house.
[28.44] I would have decorated 
this house for you?
[34.12] I would have accepted your marriage?
[40.84] Tell me, is that what you think?
[43.96] No, you wouldn’t have done that.
[49.08] Afnan, everything was going on,
[54.24] then what was the need to get married?
[57.68] You brought that girl to my position 
and made her stand next to me.
[65.04] You gave her your name,
[68.36] why did you do all this?
[74.12] What are you saying?
[77.72] What is wrong with your thinking?
[86.08] You know what is the problem 
with women like you?
[93.56] When your husband is doing 
something unlawful,
[98.24] it doesn't make any difference to you
[104.16] but when they lawfully accepts 
someone and marry them,
[109.04] you women have an objection on that,
[123.88] it doesn’t get up to your standards.
[129.96] What are your standards?
[141.36] That pathetic girl?
[150.00] That TikToker who eloped 
from her house?
[151.76] Enough!
[159.12] Don’t say a word after that, Alizey,
[172.68] she is my wife now.
[176.92] You never got me respected so much,
[179.16] never took a stand like that for me,
[187.08] today you are feeling hurt for her?
[189.08] Afnan, I don’t want to talk to you.
[210.16] Wait a minute.
[213.04] Yes, this is wrong.
[216.40] What?
[217.32] That you cut the call without 
even looking at it.
[220.44] What do you think,
I will doubt you?
[223.48] No but there has to be a question,
[226.56] that will you ever doubt me?
[231.00] To be honest…
[235.40] Wait a minute.
[238.64] Why don’t you attend it?
[240.08] It is not very important to attend the call.
Leave it. tell me,
[244.16] will you ever doubt my love?
[248.92] Umm,
[250.12] do one thing, you talk on the call,
and we will talk later.
[252.76] Hey, no, it is not an important call.
[256.00] Pick up the call.
[263.80] Look I know you are feeling insecure
regarding Ramsha,
[268.52] but I just want to clears that
[270.64] we just had a temporary friendship 
between us
[274.24] which is not there anymore, 
it doesn’t exist.
[276.72] Afnan, I can’t share you with anyone, 
you know it.
[280.88] And that Ramsha wants to take you 
away from me, I know.
[284.68] I know it very well.
[287.08] Please, you won’t leave me, 
Afnan, right?
[289.00] Please don’t leave me, 
I will get mad without you,
[291.28] I am telling you.
[293.16] Yes, yes, Alizey, 
I know you love me a lot
[296.48] but trust me I love you a lot too
[299.44] I can’t even think about anyone
except you
[302.96] and I promise you 
I will never leave you,
[306.28] please take out this insecurity 
from your heart
[309.12] there is nothing between me and 
Ramsha, Alizey, nothing.
[312.20] I am just yours. Just yours.
[327.24] Hello Afnan.
[329.60] When I don’t want to talk to you
[332.20] then why are you continuously calling me 
and bothering me?
[335.52] If I won’t call you, 
who else will I call, Afnan?
[338.36] Call those friends of yours
[345.96] who you have asked to get 
the video viral.
[350.72] Why don’t you believe me, Afnan?
[359.16] I haven’t done anything like that, 
why would I do all this?
[368.28] I don’t even why have she done all this?
[371.00] I don’t trust anyone now.
[378.60] Not even my own self.
[389.48] You haven’t just made me 
lose trust in the world
[392.04] but my own self as well, Ramsha.
[395.76] Afnan, just come home once, 
come home,
[408.04] sit and listen to me, give me 
a chance to speak at least.
[411.84] Please don’t disturb me.
[417.48] I am already going through 
tough times because of you.
[422.64] For God’s sake give me peace 
for a while.
[427.12] I don’t want to talk to you, 
I don’t want to meet you.
[436.92] Now don’t call me again and again.
[439.28] Bye.
[440.76] Afnan? Afnan?
[596.56] Ahmed, did you get to know 
Sir Afnan did second marriage?
[605.20] What are you saying?
[606.88] Sir Afnan did a second marriage?
How do you know it?
[613.32] Not just me, the entire world knows it,
look the video has been viral.
[619.80] Oh yes, this is Sir Afnan.
[647.28] You are responsible for 
this loneliness too.
[654.32] I am surprised that 
an intelligent man like you,
[659.12] how can he make such 
a huge mistake.
[669.36] You married Ramsha.
[676.04] Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys
[679.76] who are family-oriented and rich too,
[682.80] they marry them
[698.48] and that is what Ramsha did too.
[700.88] You are honorable, family-oriented, 
and rich too,
[707.84] she married you and defamed you
[714.44] and then she got famous overnight
[720.04] because that is what she wanted.
[819.80] Afnan I have been calling you for so long,
you are not even picking up my call.
[823.04] I can only explain it to you 
if you pick up my call once.
[826.28] At least give me a chance
to say something.
[853.52] Alizey,
[855.16] I would suggest you join your office.
[867.56] You will at least stop thinking about 
this once you get busy in your routine,
[882.16] else you will get unwell thinking
about all this
[894.40] and look in your condition,
[896.96] doctors strictly ask you
[907.00] not to take tension in 
such a condition.
[911.60] so then what should I do by
going to the office?
[925.28] People will ask me multiple questions there,
 Mom,
[941.68] what will I answer everyone?
[953.24] My colleagues have called me 
so many times just to ask,
[957.00] after all what has Afnan done to you?
[971.08] What should I tell everyone about 
your nephew’s doings?
[985.44] I will be the one facing trouble if I go,
[988.08] everyone will have just one question,
[990.60] why did Afnan marry a TikToker 
and left such a good wife?
[996.20] Enough Alizey,
[998.04] people act very innocent but they are 
not that innocent from within,
[1009.32] they know everything and 
they even know
[1011.96] that such girls trap honorable boys 
and marry them.
[1028.64] And Alizey, you are not the first wife
[1031.60] there are thousands of such wives 
going through the same trial.
[1053.92] All that is fine Mom
[1056.32] but if Afnan doesn’t divorce Ramsha,
[1067.88] so I will take separation from Afnan.
[1104.88] What kind of a wife are you, Alizey?
[1107.32] You don’t know anything about 
what your husband is thinking,
[1110.40] what is going on in his heart? 
Why is he worried,
[1113.48] show some interest.
[1116.96] So what should I do, Mom?
[1118.96] If Afnan doesn’t want to share anything
 with me, what is my fault in it?
[1122.80] Why are you blaming me for it?
[1124.64] Because you are his wife
[1126.16] and still you guys have so much 
distance in between,
[1128.72] because you never took interest,
[1130.76] you just care about your career,
[1132.32] your lifestyle, you just focus on yourself.
[1135.04] Have you ever focused on your husband?
[1137.56] Because you don’t care.
[1218.84] So, you are here?
[1223.20] What did you think that if you would
hide from me and sit here
[1226.00] you wouldn’t have to face me?
[1229.16] What is the use?
[1235.00] Whenever I come in front of you, 
you shout at me, and get angry,
[1238.76] it feels like
[1241.56] you cannot tolerate me,
[1244.60] so I came here for peace.
[1248.52] So didn’t you go to your second wife?
[1252.12] Your social media superstar 
Ramsha Khan.
[1257.36] By the way, at least ask her
[1258.92] which video of yours she plans 
on getting viral next.
[1264.00] What do you mean?
[1266.52] What are you saying?
[1268.76] Go and ask your wife,
[1275.48] what other video she plans 
on getting viral.
[1279.88] Alizey,
[1281.72] did someone say something to you?
[1284.16] Why are you saying all this?
[1291.40] Answer me why are you 
just looking at me?
[1293.92] I am asking you something.
[1297.36] I am just watching how big of a 
headache has
[1301.40] this second marriage and 
second wife become for you.
[1307.28] Look,
[1308.44] has someone said something 
to you, Alizey?
[1311.40] Whatever you are saying, 
I am unable to understand.
[1314.84] Tell me.
[1325.52] I forgot, I forgot,
[1328.16] I forgot you don’t want peace 
in my life at all
[1337.24] and if accidentally I am about
to get some peace in my life,
[1339.76] you do something that 
takes the peace away.
[1344.68] Afnan,
[1348.28] divorce Ramsha.
[1386.20] Afnan, I am saying something to you.
[1387.80] Afnan?
[1398.32] What happened Alizey? 
Why are you doing this?
[1400.32] What am I doing?
[1401.64] Now what is this another trouble 
you have brought on me after Ramsha?
[1404.40] Alizey, talk to me slowly,
[1405.92] I am giving you the last warning
 don’t do all this.
[1408.60] tell me honestly who was that girl?
[1410.72] It's good everyone should know 
how you are cheating on me.
[1413.28] Shut up.
[1422.96] Just shut up.
[1426.28] Get out of this place.
[1428.92] Get out of this place right now.
[1447.80] You are doubting me?
[1451.08] Shall I tell you the truth?
[1457.72] No.
[1459.08] I am not doubting you at all.
[1464.20] Yes, I used to doubt you before
[1466.36] when Ramsha was living in our house
[1472.80] but since Ramsha has left
[1475.56] I am in peace now.
[1483.92] If she got married to Shani,
[1486.20] she should have compromised 
and lived with him,
[1489.36] and Shani has accepted her after 
so much has happened anyway,
[1494.04] else who marries such girls?
[1509.76] What happened? Why are you 
looking at me like this?
[1512.36] Even you rejected her.
[1521.00] Yes,
[1524.68] I guess that was the biggest mistake
of my life.
[1530.72] What is wrong with your thinking?
[1535.24] You know what is the problem 
with women like you?
[1545.44] When your husband is doing 
something unlawful,
[1550.16] it doesn't make any difference to you
[1556.88] but when they lawfully accepts 
someone and marry them,
[1561.64] you women have an objection on that,
[1569.68] it doesn’t get up to your standards.
[1578.52] When you can have an affair with 
a girl despite having a wife,
[1581.80] so I cannot even question you publicly?
[1585.52] Lower your tone when you talk to me.
[1587.24] You behave yourself,
[1588.92] what do you think you will act strict 
with me and put my voice down?
[1593.88] I won’t get quiet at all,
[1595.36] I am not here to watch your show.
[1597.76] And what do you think, 
you will keep on accusing me
[1600.44] and I will accept it in front of everyone?
[1605.56] This is your problem,
[1607.08] when I come to talk to you, 
you start shouting, misbehaving.
[1610.96] so why shouldn’t I shout? 
I will yell even louder,
[1614.00] I will tell everyone 
he has betrayed me.
[1615.68] I have betrayed you, right?
[1617.04] So do one thing, 
don’t live with me
[1622.08] but clearly tell me this today,
[1624.36] my mind will get clear as well and 
I will make arrangements accordingly.
[1658.36] I knew you would come,
[1660.80] I knew you would definitely forgive me,
[1663.56] you will realize that 
it was not my mistake. Afnan,
[1667.08] thank you so much for coming.
[1669.48] I am actually innocent, it’s not my fault.
[1671.80] Thank you for understanding this.
[1674.80] Now what is your plan next?
[1681.52] What plan?
[1682.56] There is no need to act innocent 
in front of me,
[1685.52] what are you about to do next, 
tell me?
[1688.72] What plan will I have, I…
[1689.92] Ramsha, for God’s sake don’t do 
this drama in front of me,
[1693.52] both of you women have made me 
go crazy,
[1696.32] but I won’t get crazier now.
[1698.96] Where is your phone?
[1701.08] Quickly tell me where is your phone?
[1702.40] There, it’s there.
[1714.80] Afnan?
Enter password,
[1716.68] enter password quickly.
[1736.60] Why have you kept these Nikkah 
pictures with you?
[1739.56] Because it is our pictures… 
So?
[1746.32] What do you want?
[1748.56] You want to use them against 
me as well?
[1751.24] You have kept them 
so you can blackmail me,
[1754.36] like you got our shopping video viral,
[1756.80] you will do the same with Nikkah 
pictures too, right?
[1759.24] Why would I do that?
[1760.68] Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife.
[1765.92] You got our video viral so people can 
get to know about us,
[1770.36] and now you will get these Nikkah 
pictures viral
[1772.68] so everyone can know we are married,
[1777.08] but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once,
[1780.92] what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha?
[1789.04] Delete all these.
[1791.24] Delete them.
[1800.48] In fact, leave it,
[1803.00] I have always gotten ditched 
by trusting you.
[1807.68] Why are you doing this, Afnan?
[1809.92] I don’t trust you anymore, Ramsha,
[1819.56] not at all, and where there is no trust,
[1823.72] there is nothing at all.
