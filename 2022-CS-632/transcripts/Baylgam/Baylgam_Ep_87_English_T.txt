[21.28] Yes, absolutely fine 
by the grace of God.
[24.12] Umm Yes Mr Balaj,
[25.04] do one thing deliver the car
[28.28] to the same address
[30.04] that I have sent you.
[32.24] Yes, I will also send 
you the pin location
[34.12] but it shouldn’t go to 
any wrong address.
[37.32] Thank you so much.
[38.68] Thanks.
[41.40] Congratulations Miss,
[42.76] your new car is coming tomorrow,
[44.92] I have ordered a car for you.
[47.52] What?
[52.20] Car for me? Why?
[55.68] You will need the car,
[62.76] you will have to go to places,
[64.88] or what if you need 
something for the house,
[66.60] so you must have a car.
[78.68] In fact, I have also arranged a driver,
[81.00] the car along with the driver ...
[82.00] ...will stay in the parking lot at all times.
[86.44] Thank You Afnan you thought
 so much for me.
[96.48] Thank you so much.
[98.04] So then do one,
[99.20] thing teach me how to drive as well.
[102.32] Driving to you?
[104.28] So it would be good Afnan,
[105.48] if there is any emergency
[106.64] or if I have to come to you,
[107.72] or if I have any work,
[108.52] I should know how to drive as well.
[117.56] Teach me please.
[121.64] That is absolutely right too.
[129.52] Good, that’s great.
[133.64] But just know that
[140.80] I will put my life in danger and
 teach you how to drive,
[155.48] it’s your responsibility
 to protect my life now.
[208.72] Driving a car is very easy,
[211.20] first of all, fasten your seatbelt.
[214.84] Where is it?
[215.76] It’s on the side there.
[216.40] Okay, yes.
[217.52] Slowly, slowly,
[218.52] the seatbelt won’t come all the way down,
[220.20] it will be hooked there.
[221.36] You have to fasten it in this knob here.
[223.52] Wait a minute, my drape.
[224.36] Wait for a minute.
[225.52] Yes, okay.
[226.36] Here?
[227.40] here. Just put it in the 
knob in here.
[230.16] Afnan, don’t get angry,
[231.60] now look if you do this 
how would I drive?
[234.36] Umm, Set the back mirror.
[237.48] Good girl.
[239.84] Good Student
[242.24] Ramsha,
[243.28] Yes?
[244.36] The back mirror is not for you
 to see your drape
[247.40] but the car coming from behind.
[249.04] It’s for safety purposes.
[250.40] Set it. Do it,
[251.64] can you see?
[255.52] No, yes, now I do.
[257.20] Good,
[257.72] two things are done now,
[258.76] place your feet on the brake.
[260.32] Which one? Right or left?
[262.84] Left.
[263.76] Okay then?
[264.68] Put it, and this is..
[265.08] Should I move it away?
[265.92] No, no, don’t move it 
away right now,
[267.28] this is a push start,
[268.00] the car will start from this,
[269.36] here it is done.
[272.20] Now while your foot is 
placed on the brake,
[274.32] bring it drive.
[276.16] Should I move my foot away?
[277.00] On the brake... foot, foot,
[278.40] foot, while the foot is 
still pressing the brake.
[279.80] By placing my feet and then?
[281.96] 1 2 3 okay?
[285.40] Okay.
[286.24] Now put very light pressure 
of your foot
[289.36] and press the accelerator and
 then leave the brake.
[290.32] And then immediately move 
my foot away from the brake?
[291.56] Not immediately, 
not immediately,
[292.84] not immediately,
[293.76] make it straight, make it straight.
[295.08] I am doing it Afnan,
[296.56] there is also a car in front 
I also have to see it.
[298.28] Yes, be careful. Careful, careful,
[300.20] very careful..
[302.72] Umm yes, yes,
[303.96] but I feel your speed is a little high,
[306.72] It’s fine.
[307.44] It’s high, high,
[308.60] slow slow, slow down, 
slow down,
[309.72] look, listen to me,
[311.04] don’t look at me,
[311.92] look in front, dude, 
what are you…
[313.20] Dude, I will obviously look 
at you if you will talk.
[314.80] Okay sorry that I asked you 
to listen to me carefully,
[317.60] but listen to me and look
 at road and focus.
[321.48] Afnan, you are confusing me a lot,
[323.28] I cannot drive like this.
[324.88] Okay, Sorry, I will do one thing,
[326.64] I will wear the seat belt.
[327.56] Afnan nothing will happen,
[328.68] don’t scare me so much now,
[329.88] Hey, look, watch in front and drive.
[331.48] Yes, I am watching.
[332.68] Look in front, look in front,
[334.00] good girl,
[334.72] turn towards the left here,
[336.00] turn towards the left here,
[336.88] Okay, okay, wait a minute,
[337.72] I also have to look behind.
[338.56] to the left, to the left!
[352.24] I am sorry.
[357.16] Sorry brother, sorry.
[360.52] Do one thing, get out of the car.
[362.32] Afnan.
[363.08] You get off,
[364.20] I will, I will drive myself. 
You just get off,
[366.76] enough driving for today.
[369.40] Is that how someone drives a car?
[371.64] I mean you would have just 
killed yourself and me too.
[374.92] You are laughing?
[376.32] Why are you being so scared?
[378.08] So weren’t you scared?
[381.44] Why should I be scared 
when you are with me.
[389.28] Do you know
[390.48] when you are with me,
[391.56] I am not scared of anything,
[399.08] I feel I am the safest in the world.
[403.80] And when you are with me,
[406.92] my life changes.
[413.76] I know I get angry over everything
[426.16] but it is just related to the 
bitterness of my life,
[438.60] which gradually made me this way.
[446.44] But when you are with me,
[451.08] I start to see colors,
[460.08] I start liking people,
[463.60] I feel like I am living,
[475.24] I am living my life to the fullest.
[492.88] And I promise you
[495.84] I will always be with you,
[503.00] I will never leave you alone,
[507.76] Are you sure?
[517.60] Now don’t take advantage 
of all this and drive,
[520.16] get off the car, sit here 
I will drive.
[521.80] No, I will drive a bit more.
[524.04] Let’s go.
[527.84] Let’s go.
[529.84] 1 2 3
[534.16] hey, what are you doing?
[535.64] Just because of you 
draping your head,
[537.36] I will get the cloth on my face, 
I will die.
[540.28] Afnan,
[541.48] don’t say that again.
[544.40] okay I won’t.
[552.56] Shall we go?
[554.16] Let’s go.
[557.56] Ramsha.
[559.36] Ramsha, I talk to you with 
love again and again
[561.60] and you start driving fast.
[562.80] Ramsha, Ramsha, please, Ramsha?
[563.92] Okay, okay, okay, Okay Afnan.
[577.00] Thank you, Ramsha.
[582.28] Listen,
[583.92] you haven’t called Alizeh even for
 once since you have come here,
[586.88] why?
[590.56] Even Alizeh didn’t call me,
[594.48] she doesn’t care about me at all.
[602.48] Where am I, how am I,
[604.80] she doesn’t want to know.
[608.40] Don’t say like that, Afnan,
[610.32] she is your wife.
[620.60] And no matter how 
busy a wife is,
[622.28] they are always concerned 
about their husband.
[626.16] What has happened to you?
[633.60] You are talking like 
you don’t know that
[636.64] I have no importance
 in Alizeh’s life.
[640.40] Okay, forget all this,
[642.12] call her.
[651.44] She will like it if you call her.
[661.20] And what about you?
[674.96] I wouldn’t mind at all.
[682.48] Call her, I will be right back.
[691.68] Hey, why don’t you quit job?
[693.84] You are always tired because of it.
[695.92] Afnan, please,
[697.28] I don’t even have the energy
 to argue with you right now.
[700.72] Okay fine, okay fine, 
don’t argue
[703.52] but at least you can take 
a few days off before engagement.
[707.28] But why?
[709.12] Who takes an off for engagement?
[711.96] What do you even say?
[714.00] And I am very tired today,
[715.88] we will just go tomorrow.
[720.12] Afnan, I told you that
[722.52] even my manager is on leaves,
[724.20] I cannot take an off at this time.
[726.84] Okay great,
[728.72] call at the office and inform
[730.36] there is an emergency at home,
[732.68] if manager can take an off
[734.16] then you can too.
[736.96] Afnan, by the way, 
why are you so worried?
[739.72] The doctor was just telling 
you Uncle is better now,
[743.88] let him rest,
[745.16] there are other people 
at home too,
[746.80] servants are here too,
[748.76] so please don’t worry.
[752.16] That means you will definitely
 go to the office.
[758.68] Why are you being worried like
[760.16] Uncle has been unwell for ages?
[765.84] I am not worried about
 Dad’s health
[770.36] as much as I hurt due 
to your behavior.
[775.76] Please Afnan,
[776.88] stop talking nonsense,
[778.44] I was concerned for him 
that is why I came early.
[780.96] Yes, I can clearly see
[783.04] how much you were concerned for him.
[787.68] Afnan, actually there are some people,
[789.72] no matter how much you do for
 them they never get happy,
[793.92] you are one of them.
[802.08] Afnan, you haven’t been giving me 
time since Uncle has been hospitalized.
[807.48] You are so feelingless,
[809.60] my dad is fighting the battle of life 
and death there at the hospital
[813.24] and you just care about 
yourself here.
[815.80] Afnan, I guess you 
are forgetting
[818.16] that Uncle is at the hospital
 because of your most beloved,
[821.92] so if you are being so angry,
[823.44] go tell this to Ramsha, not me.
[825.60] I don’t understand that
[826.84] even after so much has happened,
[828.56] you are still letting her 
live in this house,
[834.00] in fact, how will you get 
her out of the house
[835.96] when you couldn’t take her 
out of your heart yet?
[841.16] Okay, forget all this,
[842.88] call her.
[844.84] She will like it if you call her.
[869.40] Hello?
[871.00] Thank God, that you cared 
about calling me as well.
[875.28] What if I make the same 
complaint to you?
[878.72] How can you make the same 
complaint to me, Afnan?
[888.32] This is your responsibility to call 
me when you reach there
[891.72] but you didn’t even inform me.
[895.48] Alizeh, why do you 
always blame me?
[898.40] Because it is always
 your mistake, Afnan.
[912.08] Do you even realize?
[913.52] In fact, why would you?
[914.80] You never realize.
[926.16] I have been waiting for 
your call for so long
[928.52] but you are so careless that
[930.04] it doesn’t make any difference to you.
[932.96] If it wouldn’t make any difference to me,
[934.36] I wouldn’t have called you.
[935.68] So then why did you call me?
[945.52] You have called me to brag that 
you are doing me a favor?
[955.28] Afnan, please,
[956.56] learn to accept your mistake.
[969.76] If it was me at your place,
[971.56] you would have expected me
[973.16] to inform you when 
I reached somewhere
[975.44] and if I didn’t you
[976.36] would have been 
saying 10 things to me.
[979.24] What are you doing, Alizeh?
[981.12] If you think I am saying 
something wrong,
[983.40] so then I will hang up,
 you stay happy.
[985.80] Alizeh?
[1033.12] The thing is that
[1034.76] I have made a plan today
[1037.00] and the plan is that I will do
 your make up today.
[1039.44] What?
[1040.04] Yes.
[1041.68] How will you do my make up?
[1043.40] How will I not?
[1046.28] When I can teach you how to drive,
[1048.64] so you can teach me how 
to do make up.
[1050.64] I will do it. What is this?
[1053.56] Okay,
[1054.32] so it means,
[1055.32] if you can teach me how
 to drive your car,
[1057.44] so I will have to teach 
you to do make-up.
[1059.20] You are taking revenge?
[1061.84] What’s revenge in it?
[1063.16] I want to do your makeover
 with my own hands.
[1067.56] Let’s do one thing, let’s put 
nail paint on you.
[1069.64] That is fine.
[1071.48] I can’t apply nail paint,
[1072.52] I have to offer prayers.
[1083.28] Is it Alizeh’s call?
[1091.64] You attend it, I will be right back.
[1094.48] Ramsha?
[1101.40] Hello
[1103.76] I thought you will call me 
back to convince me
[1114.36] but you didn’t even call me back.
[1118.00] I got a bit busy.
[1122.04] You have changed a lot Afnan.
[1130.80] Anyway,
[1132.32] is your work done that 
you went there for?
[1136.88] Yes, almost done,
[1139.12] just a little bit is left.
[1143.36] Hmm.
[1146.20] How is the weather in Islamabad?
[1148.32] Yes, it’s nice, it’s fine.
[1159.56] Tell me why didn’t Aunt call me?
[1162.48] She usually calls me.
[1166.52] Yes, Mom is not well
[1175.48] that is why she must have not called.
[1178.52] Okay,
[1181.16] what happened to her?
[1187.60] I will do one thing,
[1188.56] I will call and ask her.
[1191.24] Yes do it.
[1192.96] Afnan, will you have tea?
[1211.16] Afnan,
[1212.20] whose voice was this?
[1213.72] Where are you?
[1214.68] What is wrong with you, Alizeh?
[1216.48] I am in a restaurant.
[1230.24] My colleagues are with me,
[1231.80] one of my colleagues 
has asked me for tea.
[1239.64] Okay listen,
[1240.44] the meeting is about to start
 I will call you back,
[1242.44] bye.
[1243.32] Hel…
[1250.64] What was this?
[1251.84] What was this?
[1253.80] I am sorry Afnan,
[1254.92] I had no idea you were
 talking to Alizeh.
[1267.88] What sorry, dude?
[1276.44] Don’t you know I was 
talking to Alizeh on call?
[1295.12] No, how would I know
[1296.60] you would be on call,
[1297.76] I felt you had hung up.
[1299.96] How can you feel that?
[1310.52] I received her call in front of you, 
I was talking.
[1320.80] You have no idea
[1321.60] I will get into such a big problem
[1323.16] and trouble because of you.
[1324.84] I think you don’t want me 
to come to meet you.
[1422.72] I am sorry Ramsha.
[1426.56] You know it very well I will never
[1429.12] cause you any pain in purpose,
[1432.00] and I don’t want you to get into 
any trouble because of me.
[1441.20] I know that.
[1445.84] You know but you still hurt me.
[1449.88] I am sorry,
[1452.40] I got angry all of a sudden,
[1454.96] but you are right that
[1456.08] it doesn’t suit me
 I shouldn’t shout at you,
[1457.60] that is why, I am sorry.
[1461.16] It’s okay I forgive you.
[1464.24] Ramsha,
[1465.68] I am saying I realize my mistake,
[1468.64] I know you have been 
hurt because of me.
[1473.20] It is your job to hurt me,
[1475.92] it's nothing new.
[1479.16] Really?
[1482.92] I haven’t hurt you or made
 you cry after marriage.
[1485.04] You have begun to.
[1487.28] Did you start?
[1490.20] I won't now.
[1492.52] Will you forgive me or should
 I become a rooster?
[1495.12] Or hold my ears?
[1497.08] Okay sorry.
[1497.76] Enough, enough I forgive you.
[1516.32] Thank you
[1520.24] You will not get angry at me again.
[1521.80] Never.
[1523.64] I am telling you.
[1662.92] Greetings, mom.
[1665.08] Greetings Alizeh,
[1666.84] Alizeh, Has Afnan 
come back to Karachi?
[1670.08] No Afnan is in Islamabad.
[1674.20] But I just saw him in 
the shopping mall.
[1680.28] In the shopping mall?
[1681.84] But I don’t understand
[1683.52] where he disappeared 
all of a sudden.
[1686.00] No mom, you must be having
 some misunderstanding,
[1694.44] Afnan is in Islamabad
[1695.84] he is coming back tomorrow,
[1696.68] I just spoke to him.
[1698.36] Alizeh, my eyes cannot
 be betrayed.
[1707.60] I am telling you it was Afnan.
[1719.84] Do one thing,
[1720.80] call Afnan right now
[1722.52] and ask him
[1723.40] if he is in Islamabad or Karachi
[1730.76] but I am sure he has 
come back to Karachi.
[1733.88] Really?
[1735.28] I will check, okay.
[1774.72] Afnan, you didn’t tell me
[1775.80] that you are going to Islamabad 
like this all of a sudden?
[1786.40] You didn’t even tell me that
[1787.76] you have a meeting
[1792.16] and you are going for 2 3 days.
[1794.28] Hey, the meeting was 
scheduled a long time ago
[1795.92] I forgot to tell you.
[1804.84] And the Islamabad office has been
 ignored for a long time as well,
[1807.92] I thought of giving
 two days there,
[1842.00] Hello?
[1843.24] Afnan, have you come 
back to Karachi?
[1848.04] Umm, why what happened?
[1860.24] Where are you, Alizeh?
[1863.16] Where would I be? I am at home.
[1876.56] Mom called me she was saying
[1878.36] she saw you at the shopping mall.
[1891.72] That is why I am asking you
[1893.08] if have you come to Karachi.
[1902.36] Hello?
[1904.20] Af.. Afnan, can you hear me?
[1907.16] Yes I can, I am listening.
[1909.68] So answer me where are you?
[1915.80] Hey Alizeh, I am in
 Islamabad only,
[1925.12] I told you that tomorrow,
[1926.64] I have to come back tomorrow.
[1939.60] Yes, but
[1941.04] I think she has had some 
huge misunderstanding,
[1942.92] she must have seen 
someone else.
[1954.76] I was sitting in a very 
important meeting in Islamabad,
[1957.88] and just came out to get your
 call when you called me.
[1968.16] Okay listen they are calling me 
again and again in the meeting,
[1971.56] it doesn’t look nice.
[1981.72] So, I will go back, 
I will talk to you later.
[1984.40] Okay, okay bye.
[2051.04] Stop testing my patience,
[2054.00] you have lied enough,
[2056.28] how much more will you lie?
[2059.36] I have seen you with that
 girl with my own eyes,
[2062.68] who was that girl, Afnan?
[2066.12] Afnan, who was that girl?
[2067.28] Alizeh, listen to me…
[2068.40] How can you do this to me?
[2070.64] Alizeh, Alizeh, you listen to me.
[2073.16] What are you trying to say? Say it.
[2074.76] Okay, I will only answer
 if you let me speak. I…
[2078.56] Alizeh, you are getting it wrong,
[2079.60] it’s not what you think.
[2081.44] I just don’t want to talk to you, move.
[2083.32] Alizeh, please I am saying,
[2084.52] trust me, what happened?
[2085.48] I trusted you the most,
[2087.60] and what did you do?
[2089.04] You broke my trust,
[2091.36] I am so disappointed 
with you Afnan.
[2113.44] Alizeh, listen to me?
[2115.84] Alizeh, listen to me,
[2116.80] what is wrong? At least listen to me.
[2118.44] What is your problem Afnan?
[2120.08] I told you don’t talk to me.
[2123.00] okay then do one think,
[2125.08] let’s think, I will think to,
[2127.40] because if you do this, then,
[2129.56] I will marry someone else.
[2131.48] Okay, so go,
[2132.60] and marry someone else 
as much as you want to.
[2134.36] I don’t care.
[2135.44] You do care.
[2137.32] I know it very well
[2138.96] you are angry that is why 
you are saying that else
[2142.00] you love me a lot for real.
[2145.28] You wish. I hate you.
[2164.88] Ramsha?
[2166.04] Ramsha?
[2166.64] Yes?
[2167.12] What are you doing in the kitchen?
[2168.76] Afnan, Abida called
[2170.12] she is not coming today
[2170.72] so I have to do all 
the work myself.
[2172.16] Okay that’s great,
[2173.24] let’s do one,
[2174.44] let’s order food from outside today.
[2175.72] No we won’t order anything
 from outside,
[2177.64] I know you don’t like eating 
from outside at all
[2179.48] so I am cooking myself.
[2180.84] Hey,
[2181.92] but I also don’t lie you
 working in the kitchen.
[2190.24] I can eat from outside for
 you for one day at least.
[2193.48] No,
[2194.28] you like pulao and kebabs,
[2195.76] that is why I am making them,
[2202.28] you will leave tomorrow anyway,
[2204.32] then I have to eat alone.
[2206.56] That is why I am saying this,
[2211.68] let’s spend whatever 
time is left together.
[2215.20] Please come sit with me,
[2216.52] I want to make every 
moment special.
[2218.40] Okay let me turn this off.
[2219.56] Quickly, quickly, come quickly.
[2222.24] Yes?
[2223.88] Sit here.
[2226.68] Right in front of me,
[2228.60] yes
[2229.68] close your eyes.
[2231.84] Why?
[2232.96] Close your eyes.
[2236.28] Okay.
[2252.24] Can I open them?
[2253.96] No, you have to keep 
your eyes closed.
[2257.32] What are you doing?
[2258.72] May I open them now?
[2259.80] No.
[2261.16] What are you doing Afnan?
[2262.68] May I open my eyes, what?
[2264.60] Open them now.
[2269.16] How did you like it?
[2272.60] What was the need for it, Afnan?
[2274.48] Why wasn’t it needed?
[2276.16] Your mood got so off 
because of me today,
[2278.48] I thought
[2279.80] I should get you a gift
 to make it up to you.
[2282.44] Yes but you apologized
[2284.08] and I even forgave you,
[2285.56] then why this?
[2286.48] But apologizing wasn’t enough.
[2295.48] I had to make it up for the tears 
that came in your eyes.
