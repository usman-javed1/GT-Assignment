[19.60] You are hiding something
[21.56] or else why would 
your heart do this?
[24.60] Tell me, did Afsheen 
say something or Alizay?
[27.92] No, no uncle, 
there is nothing like that.
[30.36] Don’t worry.
[35.32] Do you trust me?
[38.24] Yes, but sort of a question is this?
[42.60] If I tell you something,
 then will you believe me?
[45.76] Yes, child,
[47.32] why wont I believe you?
[61.32] You wanted to tell me something.
[63.24] Tell me, what are you thinking about?
[65.92] Oh, sorry.
[71.36] Yes, greetings.
[75.60] Yes, Mr. Azam.
[77.80] Yes, you talk to him.
[79.36] You ask him when does he 
want to have the meeting.
[102.28] Yes, you were saying 
something, Ramsha, child.
[179.36] All of this happening
 by planning and this
[181.12] accident was also part of
 the plan, it was part of it.
[184.56] Have you lost your mind?
[186.44] I had told you there 
is nothing like that,
[187.64] go from here.
[188.16] Lower your voice.
[190.48] This is my home, not yours.
 Do you understand.
[195.12] And I will never let this plan of 
yours to destroy me be successful.
[199.52] Hey you even used 
your mother to get me.
[203.08] I have not seen anyone 
cheap like you.
[206.16] You are cheap, not me.
[209.60] You must have used your 
parents to your advantage, I didn’t.
[219.52] Why are you so worried, Afnan?
[221.84] Hey, why would I not get worried?
[226.76] Are you and I separate?
[229.12] If you get disturbed, then
[230.84] I will also be disturbed.
[233.28] Come on, Afnan,
[234.68] I feel you have given way too
 much importance to that girl.
[237.48] Yes.
[237.80] Nothing had happened.
[239.04] I feel all of us are thinking too much
[314.80] Really? Are you telling the truth?
[316.52] Yes, child.
[318.04] The reports are much better.
[319.72] See, the doctor whatsapped 
them to me.
[324.20] Thank God.
[327.12] Thank God.
[340.96] This is a really good news uncle.
[348.84] Hey, Afnan,
[350.44] why are you standing there?
[354.44] Greetings dad.
[355.88] Greetings.
[358.48] Are you going to your room?
[360.20] Yes, dad.
[361.32] Do one thing, order sweets.
[364.20] Ramsha’s mother’s medical
 reports are really good.
[372.72] Dad, I am really sorry.
[374.52] I am really tired.
[376.04] I will ask Bashir, he will get it.
[379.96] Yes, fine.
[382.32] Fine, then
[384.28] I will go offer nawafil of thankfulness.
[386.88] You will pray, right now?
[390.12] Yes, the best way to 
thank God is prayers.
[396.72] You spend something in God’s way,
[399.04] you offer nawafil.
[406.80] You know,
[408.24] God says that
[410.64] He doesn’t like those 
who are thankless,
[418.44] and He says in the
 Holy Quran, that
[420.08] you be thankful to Me,
[421.20] so that I can give you more.
[427.88] So if we want that
[430.52] God gives us more,
 blesses us more,
[432.80] we should be thankful to him too,
[435.72] right?
[437.28] May God make us from amongst
 those who are thankful to him.
[439.48] Okay, live long.
[454.40] Oh God, thank you.
[496.92] What are you doing, Afnan?
[498.52] What are you doing?
[499.80] I am packing your bags,
 you are leaving from here.
[502.16] I will not go anywhere from here.
[503.96] You leave from here.
[506.96] Do you not understand?
[508.24] I said leave from here.
[510.84] I think I will have to go
 tell uncle everything.
[513.00] One minute. One minute.
 One minute.
[514.52] What did you say? Uncle.
[519.00] Who are you calling uncle?
[521.72] My dad is your….
[524.12] No,
[525.96] he is just my dad,
[528.92] you have no relation with him,
[530.44] so stop forming relations.
[532.36] Understand?
[534.28] I don’t want to argue with you,
[537.76] you can leave from here.
[539.00] I will not leave.
[541.32] You are the one who will leave.
[543.08] Not just from this room in fact,
 from this home.
[545.92] Look,
[547.36] Ramsha, we have already 
had a lot of drama between us.
[550.72] Right now, 
everyone is sleeping.
[552.48] It is a good opportunity,
[553.48] leave from her quietly,
[554.52] no drama will be created.
[556.08] I have told you, I will not leave.
[558.08] Don’t you understand?
[560.68] I think you will not 
understand like this.
[562.92] If you misbehave 
with me after this,
[567.00] then I will go and tell uncle
 everything about our relationship.
[572.88] You are threatening me?
[575.08] You are threatening me?
[578.00] Leave my hand.
[580.04] I wont leave it.
[582.32] I said, leave my hand.
[591.72] I have cried enough because of you,
[594.60] now not anymore.
[597.92] Your father brought me here.
[601.20] I didn’t come by my will
[604.04] and when he asks me,
[606.32] I will leave from this home, at that moment.
[609.04] But I will not even move with you asking me.
[613.48] So, it would be better leave from here.
[621.68] Once again.
[625.00] Once again, my thinking about
 you turned out to be wrong.
[630.12] You know for a second,
[631.04] seeing this getup of yours,
[632.44] I thought you have changed. But no.
[637.92] You are still the same person.
[640.80] The same stubborn person 
who doesn’t agree easily.
[645.52] Yes, that’s how it is.
[652.52] So it would be better that
[653.80] you leave from here.
[657.28] I will leave,
[660.12] but hear one thing clearly.
[664.56] The intentions you came
 with in this home,
[668.68] I will not let them be successful.
[676.84] This is my promise to you.
[757.04] Mama, our life was so good.
[760.80] You, papa, me,
[765.80] we were all so happy.
[772.32] Me and Annie would 
sit for hours and talk.
[776.92] You and aunt would always scold us.
[783.28] The restrictions of you and aunt,
[785.40] the mischief of me and Annie.
[789.00] It was such a good time, mama.
[793.40] It all got ruined.
[800.20] The time was so good,
[804.76] it all ended because of me.
[809.56] First, papa.
[812.04] Papa left me and went.
[816.40] After that all the relations ended.
[824.12] And now you.
[827.76] You are in the mouth of 
death because of me.
[840.68] This world of mobile and social 
media has ruined me, mama.
[848.16] This fake world left
 me with nothing.
[852.92] I don’t know mama,
[853.88] how many girls like me 
are in this world of deceit.
[858.32] They have reached to the point,
[861.48] where there is only destruction.
[870.72] I am already ruined,
[874.44] I don’t know
[876.48] how many other girls
 like me are there
[879.80] who are walking on this path of lies.
[890.52] I wish the girls can see 
me and learn a lesson,
[894.04] and they stop before they 
walk on this path to destruction.
[900.84] I don’t know mama,
[904.00] till when and for how long will I have
 to suffer the punishment of this mistake.
[911.16] You get fine, mama. I need you.
[921.56] Get fine soon, mama.
[924.00] Get fine soon.
[996.88] Annie.
[999.68] Yes, papa?
[1002.28] Come here.
[1013.28] Give me Ramsha’s number.
[1019.00] I have the same number for 
her that I had earlier.
[1026.88] No child,
[1028.68] I am not talking about that number.
[1035.04] I am talking about the number that
[1037.24] she is using nowadays.
[1040.80] Give me that number.
[1045.36] In fact, do one thing,
[1047.00] why give me the number,
[1049.28] child, you dial that number for me.
[1054.52] I have no contact with elder
 mama and Ramsha.
[1063.80] I have the same number 
that you have.
[1066.72] Annie, Ramsha was your best friend
[1071.00] and I am sure that
[1073.08] you and your mother
[1075.84] have helped sister in law and Ramsha
[1077.12] to runaway from here.
[1080.44] How is it possible that you help them,
[1084.08] and they reach somewhere
[1085.88] and reaching there you are 
not in contact with them.
[1092.16] You can make me swear,
[1093.32] papa. I have no contact with them.
[1095.96] I didn’t talk to him.
[1097.96] Annie, don’t lie to me.
[1101.56] You are lying the same
 way your mother is lying.
[1110.80] Look child,
[1112.92] I give you surety,
[1117.16] believe me,
[1120.20] she is my niece.
[1122.64] Believe me, I will not harm them.
[1128.40] You just give me their contact number.
[1133.72] Tell me,
[1135.56] where did sister in law
run taking Ramsha.
[1139.92] I am telling you the truth, papa,
[1141.88] I didn’t contact them at all.
[1145.12] If you don’t believe me,
[1146.32] I will bring my mobile.
[1147.56] You can check my mobile.
[1148.76] Annie…
[1149.08] Annie, go from here.
[1163.72] What is wrong with you?
[1166.12] Why are you questioning 
the child like this?
[1169.28] When we have told you once that
[1171.88] we don’t know anything about
 sister in law and Ramsha,
[1174.92] then why don’t you believe us.
[1178.40] Forget them,
[1181.76] and live your life peacefully
[1183.36] and let us live peacefully too.
[1185.92] We are tired of these 
daily arguments.
[1192.96] Don’t forget Salma,
[1196.08] if you want that peace
 returns to your home,
[1201.88] then give me the location 
of Ramsha and sister in law.
[1215.88] Don’t forget,
[1217.28] neither will I live peacefully myself
[1219.88] and nor will I let you 
people live peacefully.
[1223.84] Now Ramsha and sister in law
[1228.04] are my stubbornness.
[1230.84] My stubbornness.
[1347.84] Congratulations.
[1357.36] Are you congratulating 
me with your heart?
[1359.48] No,
[1361.72] I am not a hypocrite like you
[1364.80] that I lie and deceive people.
[1369.76] How did I deceive you?
[1373.28] We were friends for so long,
[1376.64] you spoke with me for so long
[1379.76] and you didn’t even tell me 
once that you are engaged.
[1382.52] If this isn’t deceit, 
then what is it, Afnan?
[1386.88] Look, I didn’t want to talk to you,
[1390.08] but since you are talking
 to me calmly, then
[1394.32] I will answer this too.
[1397.64] First, when I met you
 I was not engaged.
[1402.96] Yes, I got engaged 
after meeting you.
[1410.44] But think yourself,
[1413.32] what was between the two of us that
[1416.72] I would have shared things
 of my personal life with you?
[1420.20] It was not my responsibility to tell 
you everything about my personal life.
[1424.52] It was not even your 
responsibility to be my friend.
[1427.64] It was not your responsibility 
to talk to me, either.
[1430.60] Then, you still did it.
[1435.56] I am not answerable to you
 for everything.
[1437.68] Because you are a liar,
[1441.04] that is why are you saying this.
[1443.48] When a person is not clear themselves,
[1445.16] that’s when they say this.
[1451.96] Accept this,
[1454.72] that you are a cheater.
[1456.76] Just shut up.
[1509.28] How is this possible dad,
[1511.48] that the girl has no relative 
or acquaintance in this city?
[1514.80] I think she is lying.
[1519.68] How can you say she is lying?
[1522.40] Do you know that girl?
[1524.60] Me? How would I know?
[1528.36] That’s the thing.
[1529.80] Then how can you say with so 
much conviction that she is lying.
[1539.04] And what do you want?
[1540.48] I listen to you and drag 
that girl out of this home?
[1545.08] No dad, I was  just saying…
[1546.76] I am saying that
[1548.12] I brought this girl to my home
 on my responsibility.
[1551.52] Till her mother doesn’t 
regain complete health,
[1554.56] she will live here, 
she is my responsibility.
[1562.56] If I am not sincere about 
my responsibility,
[1565.96] then how am I responsible?
[1568.48] You too think about it.
[1706.08] Tabassum.
[1707.64] Yes, madam?
[1710.04] How long have you 
been working here?
[1712.68] I have been working for a long time.
[1714.64] First my grandma worked here,
[1716.24] then my mama
[1718.64] and now I am doing it.
 I had told you.
[1721.96] I remember.
[1723.64] So if you have been
 here for some time,
[1725.96] then you must also have 
been there
[1728.44] in the engagement of 
Mr. Afnan and Alizay.
[1730.36] It has not been long,
[1731.72] it has just been a few months.
[1733.32] In fact, it has not even been a year.
[1735.36] Elder sir is going to get Mr. Afnan 
and Alizay married soon.
[1741.92] Okay, it has not been long.
[1745.72] Come here, have a seat.
[1747.52] No, I will sit on the floor.
[1748.56] NO, no, sit here.
[1749.32] No, I am fine. Go ahead.
[1752.68] Alizay is the only niece of uncle,
[1756.16] so that is why he is marrying 
her to his only son.
[1760.16] No madam Alizay is not 
Mr. Qasim’s choice,
[1763.48] she is Mr. Afnan’s choice.
[1768.76] Shahida told me,
[1770.20] Mr. Afnan loves Miss 
Alizay since childhood.
[1773.24] It is their love marriage.
[1780.80] Even Mr. Qasim didn’t 
object because of his sister.
[1789.12] Now you can say that
[1790.20] the love marriage has been 
changed to an arranged marriage.
[1792.80] Yes, but they are not married yet.
[1797.44] I mean,
[1799.04] if they are not married yet,
 so love or arranged,
[1802.20] what are you saying 
again and again?
[1803.44] Madam Ramsha,
[1804.56] the wedding didn’t take
 place yet, but it will.
[1809.76] Will you tell me something?
[1811.96] Like Mr. Afnan loves Alizay,
[1818.40] does Alizay love her the same 
or is it one sided love?
[1822.88] Mr. Afnan is so good,
[1824.80] why wouldn’t madam 
Alizay like him?
[1832.92] What does litte master lack?
[1835.64] He has such good manner,
[1836.96] such a big home,
[1838.08] such a good family,
[1839.28] what more does a girl want?
[1845.92] Mr. Afnan dies for madam Alizay.
[1854.12] Fine, you go.
[1902.96] I am here.
[1904.92] Everything will be fine.
[1907.48] What sort of a girl are you?
[1910.40] You are talking 
even in this situation.
[1916.20] Thank you, Afnan. 
Thank you so much.
[1928.96] I don’t know what
 I would have done
[1930.08] had you not come. 
Those people
[1931.40] were going to do 
something bad with me.
[1933.68] Ramsha,
[1935.84] how could I not come?
[1940.32] It was you,
[1942.48] I had to come for you
 in every condition.
[1948.16] And I know well you 
didn’t do anything,
[1951.32] you are being framed in this matter.
[1956.44] But I am with you, Ramsha,
[1959.72] I will not leave you alone
 in this tough time.
[1966.28] No madam Alizay is not 
Mr. Qasim’s choice,
[1969.64] she is Mr. Afnan’s choice.
[1972.12] Shahida told me,
[1973.56] Mr. Afnan loves Miss 
Alizay since childhood.
[1976.52] It is their love marriage.
[1980.20] Mr. Afnan is so good,
[1981.96] why wouldn’t madam Alizay like him?
[1997.40] But don’t worry,
[1998.52] I will talk to Mr. Ahmad in this matter,
[1999.84] and I will sort this matter out.
[2001.16] Okay, you removed my worry. But
[2004.32] I will still visit Mr. Ahmad on 
my way back from the mosque.
[2006.96] Yes, fine.
[2007.48] Greetings, uncle.
[2008.72] Greetings.
[2011.68] Uncle, I wanted you to do something.
[2014.60] Yes, go ahead, child.
[2016.08] I took the number for
 Dr. Safdar from the nurse.
[2020.64] Can I take your phone?
 I will call and return the phone.
[2024.00] I had to talk about something 
related to mama.
[2026.60] Yes.
[2028.28] Don’t you have a phone?
[2034.84] It is surprising, in today’s time,
[2040.36] the girl doesn’t have a phone.
[2041.84] Look at the girl’s simplicity,
[2043.48] she doesn’t have a phone.
[2046.48] I am seeing dad,
[2051.24] and I am also thinking,
[2053.68] where do you find such girls?
[2059.80] At least, no such girl is in our circle.
[2067.44] You don’t worry.
[2068.44] Afnan, do one thing,
[2069.60] let Ramsha talk on the phone
[2072.56] and when you come 
back from the office,
[2074.28] then bring a good phone 
for her and give it to her.
[2076.64] Okay child? You will get to talk.
[2077.84] I will go now. May God protect you.
[2085.08] You know,
[2087.76] there is something you
 know well how to fool people.
[2098.36] You even convinced dad,
 how innocent you are.
[2109.76] Here you go.
[2112.92] Give it back.
[2117.12] You cannot use a phone 
without unlocking it,
[2119.64] have you even forgotten that?
[2122.92] Hey, where are you 
taking my phone?
[2124.76] I will not run away with your phone,
[2127.20] I will make a call and return it.
[2153.68] Fine, I will try to talk to Alizay.
[2157.76] No, no, you don’t have to talk to her, 
you have to make her agree.
[2161.28] Look aunt,
[2162.20] I am planning to go to
 Dubai next month
[2165.40] and I don’t know how long 
it will take to set the business.
[2169.56] So it would be better that
[2171.08] you talk to Alizay about this.
[2172.72] Will brother agree?
[2174.32] I will convince him,
[2175.64] you don’t worry about him,
[2177.36] but you will have to convince Alizay.
[2180.76] Fine, then I will talk to Alizay.
[2183.00] No aunt,
[2184.52] you will have to tell him that
[2186.52] once I go to Dubai,
[2188.36] then I will get  busy.
[2190.32] Then if it takes a year or two years,
[2193.36] it will be difficult to return before that,
[2195.32] so whatever happens 
will be done after that.
[2199.52] Pray that whatever I talk to her about,
 she understands.
[2202.92] If you make her understand like
 this, then she will understand.
[2205.28] Okay, I will go. Goodbye.
[2207.52] Goodbye.
