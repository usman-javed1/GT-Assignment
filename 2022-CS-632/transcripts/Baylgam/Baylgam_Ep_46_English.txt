Excuse me, I think you are looking for this. Tabassum, get it done quickly and
 come in to help me, please. Okay. Where are you going inside? What is this girl doing here? That is Madam Ramsha, she lives with us, 
uncle brought her. She is very nice, 
she takes care of us. Mom? Mom? Yes? leave this, leave this, 
leave this right now, come with me, come, I need to show 
you something, come. Go where? Mom, just come,
 where is your veil? The veil is here only in 
the lounge on the bed, but tell me where are we going? How can I just go? I will bring it. This boy is out of his mind. He keeps saying come, come, 
without even telling me. Where should I go with him? Take it, take it, take it, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, 
wear this quickly, and let’s go.
Listen to me Shani, I cannot just go like this, I have to ask your dad, he gets upset if I go 
without telling him. I will ask Annie, Annie,
 come here. Yes? If Dad asks you where is mom, tell him she has gone with me. But where are you guys going? I don’t know where are we going, Shani, listen to me, I hope God keeps everything well, 
I do not like all this, did you fight with someone? Mom, I am starting my bike, 
come, let’s go. I don’t know where this 
crazy boy is taking me, he is going to make me crazy. Hey, stop. Move from my way. I am talking about coming close, I mean to say that our hearts will get close
 if we become friends, you are pushing me away? Listen? Look, Ramsha, trust me, I will give you more
 luxuries than Afnan. What was going on? Alizeh asked me to drop
 Ramsha to the academy. I don’t know 
what happened to my car, it is malfunctioning, it's good you came, why don’t you drop her, let me take the car to 
the mechanic. Okay, then I will see you. wifes complain to
 their husbands, but Ramsha is not your wife. Shut up, just up. Answer my question. I am joking, dude. I didn’t say anything to her that you should be 
so mad about, I just said that if she has a problem
 in your house then I can make arrangements 
for her to stay. I know very well 
what that means. Everyone should know
 that this person, this person is a harasser, he has taken advantage of a 
helpless a girl without a family, he harassed her. I am ashamed to call 
you my friend today, a disgusting man like you 
shouldn’t be part of this society. Shani, check out the mansions 
and bungalows in this area, how can any of our 
relative live here? And sister-in-law and Ramsha? I don’t think so. I am sure you have had
 a misunderstanding, you took some other 
girl as Ramsha, did you even see her properly? Yes, Mom, I am the one
 who is always mistaken, don’t believe on anything I say, I am always the one who has
 had misunderstanding. I have asked before leaving, I asked their maid and I mentioned Ramsha’s name, now let’s suppose the
 face can resemble, how can the name
 be the same too? But Shani, Ramsha and sister-in-law never had any rich relatives that 
they can live here. Mom, it was her, she could be doing a job here. But Shani, you must call Mr. Qasim 
once and ask about Ramsha. 
Mom, you said this yourself that Dad should not get to
 know about this, now if I ask Mr. Qasim, the first thing that he will do is,
 he will call Dad. You are right but to be honest, I don’t understand what is going on, I am so worried. Come, they are calling you in. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Umm, brother is not home and 
Afnan is not home either, did brother call you? No. We get the packets of our groceries
 made from your shop, right? If brother didn’t call you then I am sure Afnan must 
have called you. No one called us, umm actually this is my mother, we are here to meet Ramsha. Ramsha? Madam Ramsha, some woman has
 come to meet you. Woman? Yes, she might be the teacher 
from my academy. You may go, I am coming. Yes, did you call me? Ramsha, my child? So much has happened,
 sister-in-law left us, and you didn’t even call us once, she just told us that sister-in-law passed away. My child, how did you bear all of this alone? First brother Sajid left 
then sister-in-law, at least you should have 
called us and told us. Yeah? You should have told us. But you said that you have no one in this 
world except your mother. She never considered us family. Coincidentally, I saw her here and brought 
mom here to meet her. excuse me, I think you are looking for this. else we would have never found out. But we thought that she doesn’t 
have a family that is why we brought her to our
 home just out of the fear of God. Why did you lie? You have your entire family here. Why are you standing here quietly? Will you say something? When you have your own house then what was the need to 
come live with the strangers? Why did you lie? Tell me. Hello? I cannot hear you, hold on 
for a second, please. I will talk to you in a while. My child, what is all this? why are you living here? Yeah? Aunt, come to my room with me,
 I will tell you everything, it is not appropriate to talk here, please come with me, come. You wait here for a minute,
 I will be right back. I will be back. Mom, who is this woman 
with Ramsha? Did we hire a new maid? I suggest that there are already 
so many servants in this house, make this Ramsha do something, she makes an excuse to study 
and stay in her room all day. She is not Ramsha’s maid, 
she is her aunt. What? What are you saying? Yes. You just call brother and ask him to immediately
 come home. In fact, call Afnan as well and ask him to come home, I need to talk about something 
very important with them. Both of them father and son 
have spoiled this girl a lot. I said it before that this girl is not trustworthy. Did you see how neatly she lies? But your uncle doesn’t listen to me. After all, what is going 
on in this house? Now where does her 
aunt come from? You just leave everything and call brother, right now then I will tell you what to do. Hello, uncle? Give it to me, 
I will talk to him myself. Yes, greetings brother. Brother, I need to talk to you
 about something important, please come home. Yes, there is a problem, I will talk to you in detail 
when you come home, I cannot talk on call. Isn’t uncle being a little too 
affectionate on Ramsha? That is what 
I was thinking too. Brother never showed 
you so much love and who does so much 
with strangers anyway? Forget about uncle, Afnan is behaving similarly too. He gives Ramsha’s example on 
everything and praises her. If she took a little care of uncle 
then what is the big deal? But who should tell them this? That is why I tell you
 to leave your job and focus on your home. Just look at Ramsha, 
she is such a clever girl, she is always revolving 
around brother, where is mom? Come son, let’s go. Go where? Where is Ramsha? She won’t come with us. What do you mean she
 won’t come with us? The way your dad has treated her, she is not ready to go to 
that house at all now. And by the way sister-in-law 
was with her earlier but now she is all alone and it is better for her. And anyways she is happy and 
satisfied in this house and she is safe too. What weird things 
are you saying? We should leave her at some
 stranger’s house and leave? Where is she? Call her. Quiet! Speak softly. This is not our house, this is someone else’s house, whatever you want to say, let’s get home first and
 then you can say. Mom, listen to me, like this… Just shut up. Speak slowly and let’s go home and talk about whatever 
you want to. Come. strange. Quiet and let’s go out. Ramsha why didn’t 
you tell earlier that you are Mr. Sajid’s daughter? Because I didn’t know 
that you know my dad. You are lying. Wait a minute. Look, my child, you said you have no relatives so where did these relatives come from? Uncle, when did I know that you know my dad? Why would I hide it from you? The person who can lie once can lie again and again as well so then they cannot be trusted. I was helpless, uncle. Wait a minute, Ramsha, there is no need for you
 to convince us by lying about you being helpless 
over and over again. Sometimes a person becomes 
so helpless that they have to lie about things they could have never imagined
 they would be lying about. Enough Ramsha! You have been lying over 
and over again and all of us have been standing 
here and listening to you. Uncle, you tell me yourself? Do you think these 
tears are false? Do you think what 
I am saying is a lie? Look Ramsha, I trusted you, I considered you like my
 daughter like Alizeh but you, you could have told
 me the truth, the truth you couldn’t 
have told anyone? It is not your head bent
 down with guilt today, it is my head. I have got humiliation in 
the share of that love that I did to you as a daughter, that father has got humiliation who thought that his daughter would never bring shame to him but that didn't happen. Let’s go, Afnan. But you said that you have no 
one in this world except your mother. But we thought that 
she didn’t have a family that is why we brought her to our 
home just out of fear of God. Why did you lie? You have your entire family here. Why are you standing here quietly? Will you say something? When you have your own house then what was the need to 
come live with the strangers? Why did you lie? Tell me. I cannot believe that aunt is no longer in this world, we couldn’t see her for 
one last time, mom. And I cannot believe that how did you go there alone? You could have told me, I would have come with you then I would have seen how would Ramsha not come back. Couldn’t you give me a call? That girl used to do whatever she liked while sister-in-law
 was still alive, now that girl has gotten a chance to play openly. For God’s sake, dad, aunt has passed away but you are still angry. At least don’t say all this today. What is this tone that 
you are talking to me in? Yeah? Don’t you dare, don’t you dare to speak 
like Ramsha, I am not brother Sajid that I will tolerate all this, do remember this. Annie? be quiet, be quiet, in fact, get up and go away from here. Shani, take out the car we will go
 to Mr. Qasim’s house, I don’t know what that ill-bred 
would have spoken against us. I will bring Ramsha back
 here at any cost. Take out the car. I think that Ramsha hasn’t told them 
anything about us that is why we are sitting 
here peacefully. If she had told the truth, you wouldn’t have been able to 
make eye contact with Mr. Qasim. And if you think that you can do whatever you 
want in Mr. Qasim’s house then by all means, go else there is no use going there. You don’t have to worry, I will see Mr. Qasim 
and Ramsha as well but you remember that if your daughter ever spoke
 to me in this tone, I will pull her tongue out, do not complain then. Instead of making this 
house a court, uncle should have held that girl’s hand 
and thrown her out of this house but no I don’t know why but that girl is still sitting
 in this house. After lying so much and
 doing so much, what is she doing here, Afnan? Such girls are looking for
 a chance to do a big robbery. What is wrong with you? What are you saying? You are quite educated. You have gotten good 
exposure as well, what has that girl done? The poor girl keeps on sitting 
in one corner all day. Since she has come here, she has never caused 
any harm to anyone, she hasn’t even moved
 a thing from its place and you are making such 
huge allegations about her. This is the problem, Afnan, she would never do anything because she knows it, she would never want to be noticed 
by everyone stealing small things. Try to understand Afnan, she is very clever, how cleverly she took 
uncle’s sympathy first, she kept on pretending to be an 
innocent orphan in front of everyone and then took care of him
 to make place in his heart, I am telling you Afnan,
 all this is her planning. For God’s sake, stop making these conspiracy theories. And you stop showing sympathy for her. Why do you always defend her so much? It is useless to argue with you. Kept a thief in the house. Uncle, your soup is ready, shall
 I take it to your room? Alizeh? I am sitting in the living room, tell Afsheen when she comes, okay? Okay uncle. Uncle, I have taken an appointment
 with the doctor for you, let me come back from the
 academy then I will take you. Alizeh, let me do one thing, I will leave right now so I will see the doctor
 on my way back, okay? Okay. I will get the file. Alizeh, my file is at the side table, you bring it, hmm? You go wait in the car, I will bring it. Look Ramsha, I trusted you, I considered you like my
 daughter like Alizeh but you, you could have told me the truth, the truth you couldn’t 
have told anyone? It is not your head bent
 down with guilt today, it is my head. I have got humiliation in 
the share of that love that I did to you as a daughter, that father has got humiliation who thought that his daughter would never bring shame to him but that didn’t happen. I don’t understand that by what relation can Mr. Qasim
 keep Ramsha in his house? What is she to her? What is their relationship? Ramsha was telling that he has made her his daughter. Enough, enough, enough, you let it be, no one becomes a 
daughter just by saying it, the situation is not like
 that nowadays, we don’t know about 
a person’s intentions. The environment of 
Mr. Qasim’s house and his intentions are way better than this house. What?
