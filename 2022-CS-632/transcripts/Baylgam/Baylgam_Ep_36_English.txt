Excuse me. Your phone. Thank you. What was she doing 
with your phone? Dad had said that she had 
to make an important call. Did you make the call? Madam Alizay, come quickly. What happened? Elder madam is unwell. I am coming. Listen. Hello. What happened? Where are you going? To aunt, she is unwell… She is not your aunt. You are here for a few days, so stop making these
 relations. Understand? No aunt, no uncle
 and nothing else. You don’t need to come to 
the room. Understand? Madam Ramsha. Thank God you have come. I was waiting for you for so long. I have told you so many times, once you are done with 
work, then come over. You talk to me, 
so my attention is diverted. Leave all that, have sweets. Really? What is the happiness? Wont you share your 
happiness with me? Elder sir sent these
 sweets for you. Really? Little sir and madam
 Alizay’s wedding has been fixed. They are getting 
married this month. Really? You go, I am coming. Mama, come to the doctor. Your blood pressure got so low. If you get unwell further, then? No child, I don’t have the strength
 to go to the doctor. But don’t worry,
 I will be fine. After all, I have to shop for 
my daughter’s wedding as well. Okay, I will call the doctor
 home, right? Hey, no, no, what is the need to 
call the doctor home? I just checked aunt’s 
blood pressure, it is normal. But when I spoke to the 
doctor on the phone, he was saying that 
aunt needs to rest and we need to keep her 
away from tension and stress. We don’t have to give 
her any stress. In fact, do one thing, go make fresh juice for her. Right? She must be feeling weak. Yes? Yes, I will drink juice, child. Fine. Immediately. Immediately. Quickly and make it well. Aunty, amazing, you acted so well. You impressed me today. You believe your aunt, right? I believe you? I am going to call the 
Oscar people to give my aunt the award 
for the best actress. Had you not acted so well, then Alizay would never have 
agreed to getting married. Had I known earlier that Alizay would become so
 emotional because of my illness, so that I would have 
done this drama earlier. Lower your voice, 
she is really smart. It is possible she hears us, and if she does she will get upset. But I love you. I love you. I love you too, Afnan. What did you people do? Hey man, you missed it. You know that’s why 
I was asking you to come along. Man, I should have come 
along with you people, but you know I had 
to go to the office, so I couldn’t go. Yes madam, you and your office. Anyway, I am leaving. When dad comes tell him that I will get a little late in coming. Okay, fine. Okay. Congratulations Alizay. I just had sweets so I found out that the wedding date for you 
and Afnan has been fixed. Yes, the date for the end
 of this month has been fixed. Oh wow, this is good news. By the way, it is a good thing about 
cousin marriage, you know all the good and bad things and you still accept each other. That is true, now see, me and Afnan know 
everything about each other. I know all his good 
and bad sides. Do you really know 
everything about him? What do you mean? Alizay. Yes. What was I saying? You wanted to go to 
Savera’s home, so her home is on the way, I will drop you. Yes, that’s a good idea. Yes, come on. Let’s go. Yes, what is the point of going separately? Let’s go. You know, I too wanted that I talk to Savera a little. I was just a little busy. You tell me, is everything okay? I am fine. I feel you don’t have time for me at all. No, nothing like that. I have just some work at the office, there is a lot of work in the office. Yes, so? If you cannot talk to me in the office, so what? You can go home and talk to me. When you are at home, call me. When I am at home, I want to spend the 
most time with my family. I really like spending
 time with my family. My mama and papa 
want to marry me. Your marriage? Yes. But why? What is the hurry? You make them understand. Tell them you want to 
resume your education, so you cannot get married right now. |I am tired of making 
them understand, those people are not 
willing to agree to me. Okay relax. Don’t get so stressed, so quickly. You tell them, that you want 
to be a girl from today’s times. Such a girl who is strong, 
independent, well educated, someone who can stand
 on her own feet. I am sure they will agree. You know, if you had not
 come to meet me today, then I would have gotten 
upset with you. You would have done good. You know, I am also thinking that I stop talking to you. Huh? Why? What? What are you thinking? Speak up. I am thinking that if I hadn’t come to meet you, then would you have really
 stopped talking to me? Yes, I would have absolutely
 stopped talking to you. You don’t meet me or talk to me, then why would I talk to you. After all, it has been so many days, you should know me well by now. You are right about that, but you will be surprised to hear that not only do I know you, I also recognize you well. Dad, trust me. This girl will be completely 
safe in that hostel. I know the manager of
 that hostel well, in fact, you can say that he
 is a really good friend of mine. I have spoken to him, he is saying he will take 
care of this girl’s food, when she wakes up and sleeps. Afnan, I cannot trust any 
stranger in the matter of this girl. Dad, why don’t you understand me? I am not telling you that 
you break ties with this girl or you give up her responsibility. I am just saying she will be able to live a 
better life in the hostel. After all, dad, I don’t like it, people outside, everywhere
 who are finding out about this girl, they are talking about us. They are saying what is 
a young girl doing in this home? Greetings. Yes, doctor. What? Yes, I am coming. I am coming. What happened, dad? Thank God. Hey, sister Mehnaz has 
regained consciousness. God has listened to us. God has listened to us. Ramsha. Ramsha, child. Ramsha. Mama. Ramsha, child, are you fine? Yes, mama, I am absolutely fine. Are you fine? I am fine. Sister Mehnaz, you don’t worry about Ramsha at all. She is like my daughter, once you get fine, you will take care of her yourself. yes.. yes.. Mama. Mama, what is happening? Staff. Staff Mama, I am with you. Look at her condition. You will be absolutely fine. I had told you people 
not to talk to the patient, you people, please go out. Child, come on. Come here. Call the doctor. Yes, they are checking, child. Come quickly, call the doctor. Ramsha. I have brought the phone 
dad asked me to bring. I have put the sim in it, and you know well how to
 use every type of phone. By the way, can 
I tell you something? As happy as you are about 
your mother regaining consciousness, I am way more happier than you. Because now I am sure 
you will leave from this home. Your plan will fail. Mr. Afnan, what do you think of yourself? Huh? If I tell your father about you and me, he will not ask you for justifications. In fact, even if I tell your entire family, then no one will ask
you for justification, they will hold you responsible. What will you tell them? You are threatening me? What do you have to tell them? That I befriended you? I didn’t make any
 promises to marry you. I think you are forgetting
 something, Ramsha. I could have taken undue advantage
 of you in your friendship, but I didn’t do that. In fact, I helped you, at different places. I saved you from troubles 
and problems. I did a favor on you,
 and you will tell people this? Did I ask you to be my friend? No, right? You were interested in Alizay, you used to love her. Then why did you take 
a step towards me? Why did you love me? Hey, I have understood 
men like you well. You people hold on to the crutches
 of friendship, by acting decent… Shut up. Just shut up. Why? Can you not handle the truth? If you were this decent, then you should have stayed true to Alizay. Why did you take a step towards me? Why did you love me? You don’t have an answer, right? You will never have an answer either. The tea is getting cold, Afnan. Afnan, where are you lost? Your aunt is saying something to you. I am really sorry, aunt. What were you saying? The tea is getting cold, drink it. You are not answering. No, no, dad, I was thinking about the contract 
we are working on nowadays, that is why… I am in no mood to have tea. Brother, then what did you 
decide about Ramsha? Now her mother has 
come out of the coma. But right now, she is
 not completely fine. May God give her health, she will regain health soon. Brother, I was saying that after a long time a wedding
 is coming in this home. Guests will start coming 
over in some time. Then me and Alizay will be
 really busy in shopping. In this situation leaving Ramsha 
alone in this home is not reasonable. Afsheen, you are right. I have decided that as soon as sister Mehnaz regains health. When she comes home, I will get a separate home on rent
 for sister Mehnaz and Ramsha. So that both these mother and
 daughter can live there comfortably. I have even asked
 the estate agent, that if he knows someone trustworthy,
 he should show us that home. Fine brother, the charity and zakat we do, we will give it to this
 mother and daughter. After all, taking care of
 a widow is also a good deed. and telling people about your 
good deed is like wasting the good deed. 
It is called showing off. Yes, Ramsha child, you want to talk about 
something? Tell me. I was saying that don’t worry for us. Once mama gets fine, I will make arrangements 
for me and mama. You have already done
 so much for us, don’t do anything more than that. Child, God is the 
One makes ways. May God give you strength
 and courage. He does it for everyone. 
He helps everyone. And yes, I didn’t do anything for you, child. I did it for myself. This way, we will also get some
 good deeds written in our fate. So that God forgives our 
mistakes and wrongdoing. Live long. Yes, greetings dad. Yes, dad, fine. I will bring her. Yes, don’t worry, 
I will bring her immediately. Goodbye. You please call the driver. Call the driver and find out when 
he will come. My mama. My mama. Afnan. Afnan. Afnan, you know my mother 
has got really unwell. She is in the hospital, and the doctor has said she cannot breath. You please take me to mama. If something happens to mama, then I will not be able to forgive myself. I want to meet her. I want to see her. Please… Okay. Nothing will happen to your mama. You just pray for her. Be strong. Do you want to go with her? Yes, the doctor has said 
she is taking my name. She want to talk to me. You please take me quickly Afnan Okay, you stop crying. Come with me. You please come on. Mama, what is all this? Ramsha is worried. Why do you worry? Mama, get up. Mama. Mama, nothing happened to you. You know, you are absolutely fine, mama. Mama, get up. Mama, you cannot leave 
me alone like this. Mama, who will I live with? I have no one. Mama, how can you do this with me? Mama, see I am here. You will be fine. You will be absolutely fine. Mama, how can you do this with me? Who are you leaving me with, mama? I have no one in the world. You know that. Get up. Get up, mama. Please, get up. See, I am here. Doctor. The doctor will come and you will be fine. Nothing will happen to you. You cannot leave your 
Ramsha and go like this. Mama. Mama, get up. 
Mama, please. Mama, please, get up. Mama, please listen to me, don’t leave me and go like this. Mama, don’t leave me and go, mama? Mama, who will I stay with? You know I have no one other than you. Papa left as well. 
Who will I live with you? Why are you not getting up, mama? Mama, see, open your eyes. Open your eyes and look at me. Why are you listening to me? You, get up. Mama. You know the children of our home
 are really soft hearted. They sympathize with people
 as soon as they see tears in someone’s eyes. In this sympathy, Afnan took her to the 
hospital with him. You are worried for no reason. Mama, did you not see how Ramsha was reacting? Like she know Afnan for a long time. I still don’t understand 
what happened. Did you not see 
how badly that girl was crying? When you and 
I can feel sorry for her, then Afnan too would have 
felt sorry as well. Mama, but I am surprised, Ramsha has not been 
in our home for long. But she is meeting Afnan, like she knows him for a long time. 
She knows him for ages. Alizay, look at her mother’s 
condition, it is really serious. In this worry, Afnan came in front of her and she went to the 
hospital with him. That’s what I am trying to 
make you understand. Afnan is calling. Hello. Greetings. What happened Afnan? Oh. Okay Afnan, let me 
know whatever happens. Okay. Her mother passed away. Tsk. Tsk. I had told you, this is why she went to the hospital 
with Afnan in such a hurry. Mehnaz, this is the same Ramsha right? She grew up so quickly. I remember the day when the nurse gave a doll in my arms, that sir, you had a daughter. I thanked God, that thank you God, you sent blessings to our home. Hey, you ask me, who has tolerated 
her every single day. Your daughter has 
grown up with difficulty. Do you see that? Do you hear that? She tolerates me daily. It is good you heard
 it yourself today. Hey, no child, your mother 
really loves you. She is joking. I know that. Mama loves me the most. What does you getting 
embarrassed do? You know, me and your father are tired of giving clarifications 
and lying to the neighbours. Mama, I promise you, after today, I will do whatever you
 and papa say, and however you say it. But please forgive me, 
and give me one chance. Please. If someone breaks 
someone’s trust for one time, then you don’t trust them again. What happened child? Ramsha, why are you scared? Did someone say something to you? Did Shani say something? No mama, no one said something, I am just really scared. Why child? Why are you scared? What are you scared about? I am afraid of myself. I feel that I am really filthy, I am really bad, I am really scared. I don’t like it. No my love, there is nothing like that. There is nothing like that. Don’t think that. You don’t know what I saw just now. I saw that I am really 
scary on the inside. I am really filthy and bad. Mama, I am not good. 
I am really bad. No child, see, you would have 
surely seen a dream. I have told you to recite 
Ayat ul Kursi before you sleep. You must not have recited it, that’s why you are scared. This was a dream, child, it has nothing to do with reality. It was a dream? Yes, my love and I am with you, you don’t need to be scared at all. Mama. Mama, you don’t leave me and go. I am really scared. No my love, how can 
I leave you and go? I am with you, my child. Okay, be quiet. Everyone bothers me, everyone taunts me, 
everyone is cursing me. Mama, what do you people think that the wedding got canceled, I got made a joke made
 out of everyone? I got insulted in front of everyone. Do I not feel pain? Am I not tortured? I am really sad, my papa left me and went. I am in a lot of pain.
 I feel my heart will stop. I cannot tolerate what 
everyone is saying. Okay. Okay. Now the situation is not like before. Earlier your father was alive, but now I cannot take any decision alone. It feels like we are standing
 in blocked streets and even if I close the windows 
out of the fear of the storm, still we will suffocate to death, child. Try and understand, I have become weak child, I have become a widow. I cannot take the burden of any
 wrong decision of yours on my shoulders. I cannot take up the burden now.
