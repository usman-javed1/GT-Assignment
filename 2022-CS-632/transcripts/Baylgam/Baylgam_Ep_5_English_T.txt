[36.48] Hello?
Hello?
[38.76] There is a limit Afnan,
[40.32] you are such a feelingless person,
[42.28] I called you so many times, 
sent you so many texts,
[44.44] but you didn’t reply even once.
[47.12] Hey Ramsha, it’s not that,
I was busy at that time.
[49.84] Busy?
[50.68] You are always busy, do you even have 
time for me or not?
[53.92] You are so angry?
[55.28] At least listen to me.
[56.88] I called you but you disconnected it.
[59.64] What if I disconnected the call?
[61.76] You could have called me again
[64.68] but no, Mr. Afnan has such ego, 
why would he call me?
[69.96] Dude!
[71.20] When someone disconnects our call.
 It means that they are busy
[74.80] and when someone is busy, we should 
not disturb them again and again.
[77.92] So, I just thought that 
when you will get free,
[80.92] you would call me,
[82.76] and coincidentally, when you called me,
[85.24] I was out somewhere, 
so I couldn’t receive your call.
[88.84] Really?
[90.04] Tell me something,
[92.28] is there any extra tax on calling 
when you go out?
[95.92] There is no extra tax 
but you talk so nicely,
[101.84] I really enjoy listening to you talk,
[104.52] that is why I thought I shouldn’t waste 
such good talk in all this noise,
[109.44] so I didn’t attend the call
[111.08] else you know that I don’t even 
have time to itch.
[134.12] Okay, okay, I have to go out for 
shopping with my friend anyway,
[137.36] and I will call you, 
if you don’t pick up my call,
[139.56] I will not talk to you. 
Okay.
[142.08] Bye.
[143.88] Bye.
[156.48] Okay do one thing, 
send me the pictures
[158.88] and send me the complete details,
[160.80] I will show them to Ramsha’s father, okay?
[163.52] Okay, bye.
[166.64] Whose call was it?
[168.60] I was talking to Rukhsana.
[171.16] Rukhsana who?
[172.44] Rukhsana, the matchmaker,
[175.20] she has recommended a very 
nice proposal for you.
[178.40] What is wrong with you, mom? 
What is all this that you are into?
[181.76] What do you mean?
[183.64] I did tell you that your dad has asked me
to look for a nice match for you
[189.16] and start preparing for your wedding.
[192.40] I thought you and dad must be joking.
[195.40] Oh ho!
[196.72] Tell me something? Does anyone
 joke about all this?
[200.12] yeah?
[201.80] Okay listen, send 2 to 4,
[204.36] in fact, some more pictures of yourself 
on Rukhsana’s WhatsApp,
[208.80] and send the good ones in good clothes.
[212.40] I will do one thing,
[213.96] I will also send you Rukhsana’s number,
[215.76] she will forward the ones she finds appropriate
to send to the respective families. Yeah?
[220.20] Hey, take Rukhsana’s number…
[236.24] Hania?
[237.28] Let’s go in that shop, that one.
[238.80] Hania, enough now,
[240.60] you have shopped so little 
in so many hours,
[242.68] do you know I can complete 
my shopping in this time
[244.92] and by the way, Ainy is not well 
she hasn’t come with,
[248.12] I will have to go home alone.
[250.84] okay, we are just going.
[253.92] Do you want to buy anything, 
then don’t complaint later to me.
[256.52] No, nothing. 
You just hurry up please.
[259.72] Then later…
[266.44] Hania, wait a minute,
[268.16] I am coming, just stay here for a minute,
I will be right back.
[270.64] Hey, where are you…
[275.04] Afnan? Hi?
[276.92] Hello. I’ll call you back.
[278.80] You here? 
Wow what a pleasant surprise,
[281.36] have you come here for shopping?
[282.36] Yes, I came with a friend, 
I told you.
[284.28] What are you doing here? 
You had so much work?
[286.68] So, I am here to do that, 
I have a meeting with a client,
[289.04] I swear there is a meeting, 
I am here for that.
[291.16] You can ship meanwhile, 
are you done shopping?
[293.28] No, I didn’t had to shop, 
my friend had to,
[295.52] she has been shopping so much
 that I am fed up now.
[297.28] You just stay here, I will let her know
and come back in 2 minutes.
[298.92] Don’t go anywhere. 
Hey?
[300.00] I am coming back, wait. 
Hey I have a meeting, I…
[305.60] Hania, you do one thing,
[308.48] you may go I will come back
on my own, okay?
[310.96] Okay but tell me who is he?
[316.28] Him?
[319.24] He is my fiancé.
[321.72] Wow, he is very handsome.
[324.60] Okay, fine, I am going to go with him,
[326.64] you get home and text me, okay? Bye.
[329.08] Take care. Text me when you get home.
Bye.
[338.84] Afnan,
[340.08] I have sent my friend home, 
now we will shop together.
[344.24] You sent her home? 
Yes.
[347.52] And then you will drop me home.
[349.08] You will go with me? 
Yes.
[366.52] Really?
Yes.
[368.00] But this looks so pretty.
[369.80] Hmm. 
But Afnan, tell me something.
[371.72] Hmm?  
Wait.
[372.92] This is such an expensive phone, 
what was the need to get it for me?
[375.40] You keep this back, 
I cannot keep it.
[377.44] You will return the gift? 
It is your birthday gift.
[380.56] I couldn’t buy anything for your birthday
 in a rush the other day,
[384.00] so I felt really bad, and look, 
you do make videos, right?
[387.48] It has a very good video result, 
it will be helpful to you.
[390.44] You are absolutely right.
[391.88] You know my phone was so old,
I was thinking to buy a new one soon,
[395.92] and now you gifted it to me, 
by the way how did you find out?
[398.40] I just find out.
[401.12] It’s a very nice phone,
[402.40] I am thinking to make a lot of TikToks
 from it and selfies too.
[405.76] Listen?
[407.40] Where did you get these bangles from? 
They are very nice.
[409.96] These are just crystal bangles.
[411.56] So, what if they are crystal?
[414.64] That’s a big thing, 
who likes crystal bangles?
[417.12] You like them by the way.
[418.24] I really like bangles in girl’s wrists
[420.84] but they look very special in your hands.
[425.00] Thank you. Then I will wear them 
daily from now on.
[429.28] You know that’s very nice about you,
[431.24] you listen to everything I say and 
implement on it too.
[433.80] But listen it is getting late now,
[435.40] I told the client that I am coming back 
in an hour,shall we leave?
[438.12] Let’s go. 
Come.
[448.84] Alizey,
[450.44] hey dude, I was looking for you 
in the entire house, where were you?
[453.72] What are you doing?
[455.28] I have a meeting with HR tomorrow, 
I am preparing for that.
[457.76] okay.
[459.56] Thank you. Umm, take this.
[464.24] What is this?
[466.04] It has my heart in it.
[467.68] You are acting very poetic today?
[470.12] Mister, I neither understand 
poetic mind nor you,
[474.36] but now I have to live with you all my life.
[476.92] Let's see what happens to me. 
Now look what’s in it.
[484.20] Crystal bangles?
[487.36] You have got them for me?
[489.76] Now I don’t have anyone in my life 
except you
[492.04] that I will get this for.
[493.56] It is for you, wear them, 
it will look very good in your hands.
[496.20] Afnan, you know that 
I don’t have time for all this.
[499.36] hey…
[500.76] how long does it take to wear bangles?
[502.44] Wear them, I have bought them 
with so much love.
[504.12] Afnan, please,
[505.60] I don’t have time for these stupid things,
[507.44] can’t you see that 
I am preparing a presentation?
[510.16] I also have to go in the morning.
[512.44] I don’t know you just pick up 
anything and bring it.
[515.20] So, I shouldn’t be doing a presentation now?
Should I stop working?
[520.08] Okay now let me work now, go.
[521.88] Okay then, I am not holding your hands.
[541.44] Have some?
[542.48] no, no thank you, I don’t feel like 
having it right now.
[545.08] Ramsha, let’s go,
[547.68] Sir Asim’s period is about to start.
[550.44] Ainy, I have just come back from the lab,
let me take breather in peace.
[554.64] By the way, Ramsha,
[556.88] your fiancé is very handsome,
[559.72] do prevent him from evil eye.
[561.44] Okay, I will be right back.
[564.96] I will be right back.
[565.84] okay bye. 
Bye.
[572.08] What did she just say?
[573.72] Who?
[574.60] What did Hania say? 
What Fiancé?
[578.16] Oh fiancé?
[580.72] Umm, she was in the mall 
with me yesterday,
[584.40] so I met Afnan there,
[587.72] now I didn’t know what to say 
so I told her that he is my fiancé.
[593.04] What’s wrong in it by the way?
I said the right thing, no?
[597.96] How many lies will you tell everyone?
[600.44] What is wrong with you Ainy?
[602.76] What of he is not my fiancé today, 
he will be in future.
[606.40] He is such a nice guy by the way,
[609.20] he even loves me and like me too,
[611.16] when I will tell mom and dad about him, 
they will never refuse.
[616.72] What we want, never happens in life.
[618.88] Yes, but whatever I think happens.
[621.20] Okay then end of story.
[622.96] Why should a person talk to you 
when nothing affects you at all? Yeah?
[626.20] So then don’t talk and stay quiet, 
don’t try to be my mother everywhere.
[633.64] Come on go, go and quickly study, 
go attend your class.
[636.48] I won’t go unless you come along.
[639.32] Slacker. 
You.
[643.00] Ramsha, come on now.
[654.60] Wow,
[656.28] what a dress.
[658.08] Hania, you were absolutely right,
[660.44] such modern dresses are 
in trend these days
[663.00] and by the way,
[664.72] I look so pretty in this dress.
[667.72] Oh my God!
[669.32] I will make a lot of videos today.
[672.36] Now just see,
[673.56] I will make such videos that 
they will go viral everywhere.
[677.40] 1 2 3…
[708.96] okay now, one more.
[723.04] Ramsha?
[741.76] Dad, coming, I am coming, 
I am coming. Yes.
[746.24] What is this?
[748.20] Snacks, Uncle got it for you 
but he gave them to me
[751.32] but this has my share too now.
[752.68] And I am telling you that 
I won’t go without having snacks.
[756.36] It is the limit,
[758.28] there is your share in everything 
but Dad bought these?
[762.96] Yes, what did you think?
[764.84] You know I got so scared.
[767.32] Scared? Why?
[769.88] Wait, I will let you know.
[777.52] Look at this Annie,
[778.72] you know I was wearing this dress 
and making TikTok,
[782.24] I heard Dad’s voice all of a sudden 
so I got scared,
[784.20] I quickly went and changed.
[787.20] You,
[788.28] you,
[789.16] you were wearing this?
[792.96] You will wear this and make a video?
[797.16] Yes, so?
[798.24] So?
[801.04] Are you out of your mind?
[802.36] If uncle gets any of your videos, 
you will be in trouble.
[805.96] Are you mad?
[807.16] How will anyone see the video?
[808.60] Dad, Shani, and uncle don’t make TikToks,
[811.20] they don’t use TikToks either and 
don’t use Instagram either,
[813.60] so then who will see it?
[814.84] No one will see it, 
don’t take tension either.
[816.56] But there are 50 other people 
that they know who use it,
[819.20] if someone send the video to uncle then?
[823.32] Your thinking is so useless and nonsense.
[825.32] Nothing like that would happen
[827.48] and by the way,
[828.64] Hania has given me this dress just for a day.
[833.80] You won’t listen,
[836.88] just listen this much that serve snacks to me,
it will get cold.
[840.16] Okay fine, hold this, 
I will quickly get the plates. Okay?
[844.00] Hurry, I want to eat them 
while they are hot.
[845.52] Okay.
[862.76] Oh my God! Oh my God!
[865.16] What happened? What happened?
[867.20] 200 views in an hour.
[869.56] It means that I will get 1k views
in a day for sure.
[873.52] What do you think?
[874.56] I don’t know if you will get the views or not 
but I will get heart attack,
[877.76] my heart just jumped outside.
[879.36] You don’t know anything Ainy.
[882.04] I got so many views in such little time, 
it is a big thing.
[886.00] I feel that I am about to get famous soon.
[888.88] But I don’t know when will the day come 
when my videos will have million views,
[893.40] I am just waiting for that day.
[896.56] You must even get videos, views and 
followers in your dreams as well.
[900.68] No,
[902.84] I am even getting someone else
in my dreams these days.
[905.72] Oh!
[907.96] Who?
[909.80] That.. 
Ramsha?
[911.96] Yes mom? 
Ramsha?
[917.16] Where did you get this from?
[919.28] This?
[922.88] Where did you find this from, mom?
[925.48] I found it from where you kept it.
[929.28] Where did you get it from?
[931.12] Tell me?
[932.80] It is such an expensive phone 
who gave it to you?
[939.00] Tell me?
[940.56] Who gave you this mobile?
[944.08] And you?
[946.28] You would know which friend gave 
this mobile to her?
[953.00] Annie?
[954.32] umm,
[955.88] aunt, actually…
[957.56] Say it, Ainy?
[961.00] Umm that Aff. Afff…
[963.32] Mom, Hania did,
[965.16] Hania gifted this to me.
[967.84] tell her Ainy how rich Hania’s father is?
[971.12] Hania has gifted this to all the friends, mom.
[973.96] Aunt, I kept tea on stove.
[976.84] It will boil, let me go check.
[982.36] What is the need for you take such 
an expensive phone from anyone,
[985.04] return it to her.
[987.40] What is wrong with you mom?
I didn’t ask for it,
[990.28] she gifted it herself
[991.72] and its good to exchange gifts 
between friends.
[995.56] But we should only accept the gifts 
that we can even afford to give them.
[999.40] That’s it, just give it back to her.
[1001.56] Mom, what is wrong with you? 
She will feel bad if I return it to her.
[1005.48] I can’t return it to her, 
I won’t be able to do it.
[1008.96] Okay then
[1010.80] I will give it back to your friend,
because I will really like it.
[1015.08] No, no, no, no I will give it back myself,
[1017.84] what is wrong with you? 
You just get after me,
[1020.24] I will give it myself.
[1032.28] Thank God I am saved.
[1036.44] And this Ainy, I won’t spare her.
[1040.84] Afnan.
[1043.32] Thank God I am saved.
[1054.60] So Ainy,
[1056.80] tell me now,
[1058.60] what were you about to say 
in front of mom?
[1062.56] Umm…
[1066.28] nothing.
[1068.80] You were about to take Afnan’s name 
in front of mom, right?
[1071.40] Sorry Ramsha, I got so scared,
[1074.48] I couldn’t understand anything so,
[1076.92] and by the way this expensive phone 
was given by Afnan so …
[1081.08] So?
[1082.44] Listen to me?
[1083.44] You know had you taken Afnan’s name 
in front of mom, I would have been in trouble, Ainy.
[1088.60] I am sorry.
[1089.88] I was so scared I just thought
[1092.84] that aunt would give me 
a tight slap right now.
[1096.32] Really?
[1097.36] When has aunt ever raised her hand 
on you ever before?
[1100.32] So, I haven’t even done anything like that 
before this,
[1102.40] just because of being with you I think 
that I will get in trouble by aunt someday.
[1106.48] Look, Ainy by the way the thing is that
[1108.72] when you get in trouble by mom 
is a different thing,
[1112.88] but right now the trouble you 
are going to get from me,
[1116.00] I won’t spare you.
[1117.36] How did you even take Afnan’s name?
[1119.44] Now just see.
[1120.44] you pulled my braid again. 
You don’t let me study.
[1123.00] Okay okay okay sorry. 
Ramsha, I won’t spare you.
[1124.92] Dad? Dad?
[1126.28] What is going on?
[1127.56] Dad, look at her she is beating me 
so much for no reason.
[1129.44] She is lying she pulled my braid 
and ran away.
[1132.04] What is wrong with you? 
What is this childish behavior?
[1133.80] Why do you annoy her?
[1135.08] I annoy her?
[1136.44] You have no idea how much
she annoys me.
[1138.64] she looks very innocent 
but she is a wild cat from inside.
[1142.36] Wild cat? Now I will tell you.
[1144.68] I won’t spare you now. 
No, no, no.
[1145.92] sighs. 
I will tell you the meaning of wild cat.
[1149.76] These girls are mad.
[1152.36] I am so sorry, I won’t ever call you that
[1154.36] but you are a wild cat, no matter 
what you say you will remain a wild cat.
[1189.24] How can I just let you go like this?
[1192.72] You must watch and walk.
[1194.56] So, then you must watch 
and walk carefully too.
[1202.84] You would have been hurt 
if you had fallen right now.
[1213.12] I have been hurt by the way.
[1216.68] What happened to brother? 
He left without even getting angry?
[1220.68] I got so scared.
[1222.20] I thought he will scold us a lot.
[1223.88] Do you know, all these wild cats 
get scared like this.
[1228.28] Ramsha!
[1245.88] Greetings dad.
[1247.04] Greetings.
[1249.20] Hey you got back so late today?
[1251.52] Dad it’s just that there were 
a lot of meetings today
[1254.44] and then there was some work 
so I went to friends.
[1258.36] it’s good to meet friends
[1260.88] and it’s good to work as well
[1263.64] but working so much can affect 
your health and that’s not good.
[1268.96] No dad, nothing will happen to my health,
[1272.04] now in order to work, I have to do all that,
[1274.20] I will have to do all this work.
[1278.24] Dad, I will leave now.
[1279.64] Afnan? 
Yes?
[1281.52] now that you are here, then come let’s 
offer congregational prayer.
[1286.36] Umm,
[1287.76] dad I would have come but 
I have been awake all night,
[1292.04] there was a lot of work so I am really tired 
and sleepy too.
[1295.36] You work day and night,
[1299.88] you don’t care about day or night
[1301.88] and then drain yourself,
[1304.32] and you get tired when God called you?
[1307.20] Dad, now if I need to take 
my business forward,
[1311.36] I will have to work this hard. 
Hmm.
[1314.60] You know very well about the business,
[1317.24] you know really well,
[1318.88] try trading with God too,
[1322.16] it wouldn’t just be beneficial 
but will also lead to salvation.
[1325.48] Do you know Afnan,
[1327.20] when we walk on the path of God, 
he gives us way more reward,
[1331.24] and do remember that
[1332.96] there is no salvation in the way of success
[1335.88] but a lot of success in the way of salvation.
[1339.40] You are absolutely right dad,
[1341.36] I will try my best to offer prayers next time.
[1354.24] May God shows the right path to my son,
[1358.40] make him walk the way of salvation 
that you like.
[1364.16] Oh God! Show the right path to my son.
[1368.00] Prayers are better than sleep,
[1369.92] indeed, prayers are better than sleep.
[1373.24] Prayers are better than sleep.
[1379.00] Is it fine?
[1380.72] What do you think?
[1382.40] It’s a completely new set.
[1384.20] Actually I already have the same phone,
[1387.00] I am selling this because I got it as a gift.
[1389.64] Will you get such a cheap phone anywhere?
[1391.52] Take it and check it properly.
[1393.24] Is it stolen?
[1394.72] Are you insane or anything?
I look like thief to you?
[1398.08] Buy if you want to else don’t. Go away,
I don’t want to give the phone to you.
[1400.80] Hey I was just saying,
 you just mind for no reason.
[1408.60] Take your money and 
give me the phone.
[1410.44] Take it. 
Thank you.
[1412.04] Bye.
[1414.88] Hi. 
Hi.
[1416.56] I have bought it from Ramsha in 40,000.
[1423.24] Are you mad?
[1424.80] What did I do now?
[1427.04] you sold such an expensive phone 
for 40,000?
[1430.52] So then what would I do?
[1432.48] Don’t you remember what mom said?
[1434.56] She was saying that she will break 
this phone if she saw it again.
[1437.44] It’s good hat the phone got sold 
and I got some money too
[1439.88] and by the way, I really needed money.
[1442.64] I am thinking to make a new video 
with this money.
[1446.92] What do you think?
[1447.88] You are absolutely mad, 
Ramsha, absolutely mad!
[1450.08] You just do anything.
[1451.44] Are you mad or what?
[1453.48] Mind your own business,
[1454.80] don’t put a lot of stress on your bird-sized brain,
It will stop working.
[1458.52] I atleast have a bird sized brain but 
with you I don’t know whose brain have you got,
[1462.28] you don’t think and just do anything.
[1463.96] You don’t even care about your honor.
[1465.36] Listen, whatever I do is for my honor.
[1469.68] So that I am respectable in front of 
everyone and have some dignity.
[1473.44] You shouldn’t think at all Annie 
because you just think of rubbish.
[1476.40] See how much money did I get.
[1478.44] Mr Muslim scholar, just pray that 
my son comes to the right path.
[1482.92] May God bless you.
I will definitely pray.
[1485.76] If God wills.
[1488.32] May God do what’s best.
[1492.00] Mr Muslim Scholar.,
[1493.60] this was our Mr Rafiq, right?
[1496.72] Yes, you recognized him right,
[1499.68] poor man is so worried.
[1501.12] Why?
[1503.44] He just has one son, 
he must be your Afnan’s age,
[1508.32] he has gotten into bad company 
and if his father tries to talk to him,
[1512.96] he fights and argues with his father.
[1518.16] I would say that
[1520.16] the environment is very bad these days,
[1523.84] children are hitting puberty 
before their age.
[1526.96] We should marry our children young
[1530.64] so that they are prevented from sins.
[1533.76] You know if someone gets 
habitual of sinning,
[1537.72] it gets very difficult to get rid of it.
[1543.20] May God show everyone the right path.
[1545.12] Amen.
[1546.40] You are absolutely right,
[1548.24] you are absolutely right. 
May God do what is the best.
[1576.12] Ask Salma how honestly I do my work.
[1580.64] I was the one who got Salma’s 
uncle’s sister married too.
[1584.48] She is so happy in her home now, 
God has willed it.
[1590.28] Yes sister in law, she is right, 
she recommends very nice proposals.
[1595.04] Yes, I have my own daughters too,
[1597.48] I don’t do matchmaking 
in every other stranger,
[1599.92] I just recommend the people 
who are family-oriented.
[1601.96] It has been 20 years since 
I am matchmaking,
[1604.68] but there have never been any complaints
from any house ever, thank God.
[1609.12] Yes, I have an idea, and by the way,
[1612.16] I completely trust Salma,
[1614.68] she wouldn’t have randomly 
called you here.
[1617.56] Mom?
[1619.12] Greetings. Greetings.
[1621.20] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1622.68] Ramsha?
[1624.24] I asked you to WhatsApp some of 
your pictures to sister Rukhsana.
[1631.44] Umm, if you didn’t have her number,
you could have taken it from me.
[1635.32] Do remember to send the pictures.
[1638.40] okay.
[1639.60] Okay and don’t just send your pictures,
[1642.40] also send all your details along with it.
[1650.08] Okay.
[1652.56] So the talk of your marriage is going on.
[1655.92] Stop your nonsense, 
else I will break your face.
[1658.76] I am right, see, 
she is asking for your details.
[1665.32] Mom, I am going to freshen up.
[1666.96] Sure, sure, go.
[1672.08] She is very beautiful 
by the grace of God.
[1728.64] This matchmaker aunt has made 
my mind so confused
[1731.52] that I'm not even able to make tiktoks now.
[1735.20] I will have to do something 
about this proposal thing,
[1737.96] the game won’t work out like that.
[1757.72] Greetings.
[1758.64] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1760.24] Greetings, stay blessed.
[1761.64] You guys together today?
[1763.36] Yes, mom I called Afnan and asked him
to pick me up and bring me home.
[1767.48] That’s good, come have tea with us.
[1770.88] No, aunt, I am really tired.
[1772.84] She talks so much, 
she eats half of my brain.
[1776.12] I will go change, freshen up 
and then have tea.
[1779.40] mom, you guys have tea, 
we will have it together.
[1783.36] That’s a great idea. 
Yeah? Let’s go.
[1785.36] You will make tea. 
okay I will. Let’s go.
[1787.44] But you make such a bad tea. 
So I don’t know how to cook food.
[1790.92] I am not talking about food, 
I am talking about tea. I can even cook.
[1794.28] It’s not my job. Do you actually know 
how to cook food?
[1795.76] Yes, why not? 
Brother your tea is getting cold.
[1802.52] What happened? 
What are you thinking?
[1809.76] I...
[1812.20] I was thinking that when both children 
like each other
[1817.12] then why not get them married?
[1820.44] That’s a great thought.
[1823.16] You do one thing, talk to Alizey 
we will then get them married.
[1828.40] Married?
[1831.08] So sudden?
[1834.04] so then what, Afsheen?
[1837.88] Alizey has to get married and 
come to this house only.
[1841.36] The sooner they get married the better.
[1844.64] How can we get them married 
so soon, brother?
[1847.60] You know that there are so many wedding 
preparations that need to happen.
[1850.72] And it will be the first wedding 
of our house,
[1854.40] I have a lot of wishes that 
I will fulfill at this wedding.
[1859.28] Actually, brother, I have been thinking 
of talking to you about this for so many days.
[1869.44] We can get both of them engaged.
[1873.48] The family will find out that 
we have gotten them engaged.
[1877.64] Look Afsheen, there is no value 
of engagement, marriage…
[1882.76] Marriage will be done too, brother.
[1886.24] Let’s do the wedding preparations first.
[1892.60] You talk to Afnan
[1894.36] and then we will fix the engagement date too.
[1907.40] Brother have tea.
[1909.24] I will.
[1949.44] Did you send them the pictures?
[1953.12] No,
[1954.64] and I won’t because I don’t want 
to get married.
[1957.32] And why don’t you want to get married?
[1959.76] Mom, I don’t want to get married, 
means I don’t want to.
[1963.68] Don’t ask reasons for everything.
[1969.56] Look, my child,
[1972.20] there is an age for girls to get married,
[1976.12] your father wants to find you a nice match
 soon and get you married.
[1981.64] What is wrong with you?
[1983.28] Have I become old that I am crossing 
the age of marriage?
[1987.32] Its not that my child,
[1989.36] the parents of daughters are 
always concerned,
[1991.92] they just want to get done with 
their responsibility as soon as possible
[1995.28] and they can live peacefully.
[1998.80] Mom, please try to understand,
[2001.00] when I said that I don’t want to marry 
then I just don’t want to,
[2004.44] why are you after me?
[2006.12] And as far as dad is concerned, 
I will tell him myself
[2009.40] that I don’t want to get married right now.
[2011.12] Won’t be ashamed of talking to 
your dad about your marriage?
[2014.40] What is there to be ashamed of,
[2017.36] I will just tell him that I don’t want to get 
married, there is nothing wrong with it.
[2020.16] it’s the right and true thing to say.
[2022.16] You won’t talk to your dad about 
anything like that.
[2025.88] Best!
[2027.04] Then you should be convinced 
and convince dad too
[2029.68] and yes, mom,  I am not saying 
that I don’t want to marry at all,
[2032.32] just for a few days, 
I mean for a few years,
[2035.60] throw this topic out of the house.
[2037.92] And as far as marriage is concerned,
[2039.68] I will let you guys know when 
I would want to get married.
[2043.40] What? What did you say?
[2046.28] You will talk to your dad about 
your marriage yourself
[2048.44] and will tell him when do you want 
to get married.
[2050.76] Won’t you feel any shame?
[2052.72] What is there to feel shame about?
[2054.60] It is my marriage so obviously I will tell.
[2061.20] Ramsha,
[2062.88] look there is an age for girls to get married,
[2066.08] and if that age crosses,
[2068.20] then it gets difficult to get good proposals.
[2071.00] And if girls get married at the right age,
the parents get peace too.
[2075.48] my beloved mom,
[2076.92] your brain has become like old mentality,
[2079.64] there are a lot of proposals and age is left too,
[2082.36] I will look for a good proposal myself.
[2086.08] Don’t worry.
[2090.16] Oh God.
[2101.12] Where is Shani?
[2103.56] My breakfast is over and 
he hasn’t come yet.
[2105.52] He is coming.
[2106.96] greetings.
[2107.96] Greetings. 
Mehnaz, get tea.
[2109.60] Yes. yes. bringing. 
Listen,
[2112.20] you must go to the shop early today
[2114.80] because your uncle and I have to go 
for an important work, understand?
[2118.52] Okay.
[2119.92] Sister in law, did you give 
Ramsha’s pictures to aunt?
[2123.80] Yes, I WhatsApped a few pictures of her.
[2127.32] Tell aunt the boy should be 
from a good family
[2129.96] and e should have a good job too.
[2131.40] In fact, it would be better 
if he owns a business.
[2134.12] Okay, I will tell her.
[2137.00] Dad,
[2138.96] actually I wanted to talk to you 
about something important.
[2146.00] Say it.
[2148.84] Actually I…
[2151.08] Hey? What is it? She just says 
anything at anytime.
[2154.40] Now look she  is saying she won’t go
 to the university,
[2156.96] she will take leaves.
[2157.92] Someone please tell her that 
why will she take leaves from university?
[2162.60] Your mom is right?
[2164.84] Why will you take an off?
[2166.96] Yes, that’s right. 
Greetings.
[2169.08] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[2171.00] Annie, I am going to the university, 
come after me if you want to.
[2179.32] Brother, shall we leave too? 
We are getting late.
[2181.48] Hmm.
[2183.40] I will make you have piping hot tea there.
[2188.52] Hmm.
[2190.04] Yeah.
[2191.20] Okay, bye. 
Bye.
[2194.48] Okay. Hmmm.
[2196.40] Bye.
[2199.28] Bye.
[2204.84] Mom, Ramsha is getting married?
[2207.12] We are just looking for a match for now, 
just pray that we get a good match for her.
[2210.48] But why are you asking?
[2213.72] Just like that.
[2214.92] Okay, take this. 
I will take it.
