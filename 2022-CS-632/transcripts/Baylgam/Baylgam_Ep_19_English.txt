 you are not answering my phone. Do you even realize how worried we are? And you don’t care about your father at all, 
that how worried he would be for you. What is wrong, mama? I had told you and papa
 that I am going to the hospital. I didn’t go for an outing. 
You are scolding me so much. Really? If I don’t scold you, what do I do? You made a mistake and
 then you are making noise too. Hey, I feel, I shouldn’t have given you 
permission to go to the hospital. Hey, you ask me, 
who has tolerated her every single day. Your daughter has grown up with difficulty. Do you see that? Do you hear that? She tolerates me daily. 
It is good you heard it yourself today. Hey, no child, your mother

before you got trapped in a big case. Thank you so much. 
Thank you. I will just call him. Thank you. 
Be quick. Yes. Yes. Hello. Hello. Afnan. Afnan, I have been 
calling you for so long. Ramsha? Whose number are you calling me from? Okay. Okay, bye. He is saying he is coming. Thank you so much. Thank you. God, thank you so much. Thank you, God. Thank you, God. What is this girl up to? Hello. Yes, Mr. Lawyer, 
you come to my office immediately. Fine, you reach my office immediately,
I am coming there. Okay. Okay. Yes? Yes, Mr. Lawyer, I was waiting for you. You please come to my room,
 it is an emergency. Thank you. Please. Please, come in. have a seat. Have a seat. Yes, Mr. Afnan, 
you called me so much urgency? All okay? The contract for your project is ready. I didn’t call you for this. Actually, there is a complicated matter, it is really confidential, so I want that it is solved properly. There is no problem that cannot be solved. You just tell me your case. Actually, it is a murder case. A murder case? Let me explain this to you. I have a friend, Ramsha. She came here with a friend of hers. That friend got murdered
 and she got blamed for it. But she has no fault in it. I have got the CCTV footage, it can be clearly seen it 
that some boy murdered her. But the issue is Ramsha is getting the blame and I want to take her 
out of this complication, so please look into it. It is a really complicated case. Whoever he is, I don’t care. I want that Ramsha doesn’t get an blame. She cannot handle this matter. Okay. I will prepare the papers of the bail, 
then we will see the case. Yes, there should be no negligence in this, 
and neither should this get leaked out. Fine. Go ahead with the case. I want it solved. Sister in law, are you worried about something?
 The food got burned. Salma, it is like worries are part of my fate. I couldn’t sleep all night. I am really worried. I was thinking about 
my daughter all night long. I don’t know what condition
 Ramsha would be in. Sister in law, just pray. We have not got any 
news of her for so many days. Salma, you tell Annie to ask someone. Find out about my daughter. If she knows someone, 
then call them, find out. Sister in law, that… Look Salma, I won’t ask anything. I won’t ask anything. Just tell her to find out, I should at least 
that wherever my daughter is, she is fine. I won’t ask anything. I won’t ask anything. Sister in law, she is smart, 
she can take care of herself. You don’t worry. Salma, she is not smart. If she was smart, 
then would she have done this? No, right? Okay, you don’t worry. See, be strong.
 I will talk to Annie. Come on. Come. Bring that girl. Hey girl, come on, 
you have been released on bail. Who got the bail done? How would I know who got it done? Come on, the SHO is calling you. Come on. Come on. Come with me. What happened? My friend, Hania. Her boyfriend shot her in front of me, 
and she died on the spot. You know, the police
 thought that it is my fault. They put me in the lock up…
Quiet. Quiet. Be quiet. I am here. Everything will be fine now. What sort of a girl are you? Even in this situation, you are talking. You are talking. Thank you, Afnan.
Thank you so much. It is okay. You are welcome. Thank you so much, sir. 
We will go now. Shall we go? Yes. Listen to me… Sit in the car, we will talk. 
I didn’t do anything. Hania. Hania. Hania, stop him. 
What is he doing? Hania. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky. Vicky, no. Vicky, no. Vicky, you won’t do anything like this.
 I am telling you. Oh madam, you have
 a murder allegation on you. You committed a murder. Sir, I am speaking the truth, 
I didn’t do anything. Her boyfriend, Vicky, 
he shot her in front of my eyes. He killed her mercilessly,
 I am speaking the truth. You have said the same thing ten times, and do you know what personality you
 are putting such a big allegation on? Yes, so I am speaking the truth, 
I am not lying. Believe me. We know what we have to do. We know our work better. Take this girl out. Sir, listen to me. If you call Vicky. Come on, girl. Let sir do his work. Then it will be better, sir.
 Instead you are punishing me. Drink some water. Drink it, you really need it right now. In fact, I even got sandwiches for you. In fact, lets do one thing, sit in the car,
 eat it, and then we will go. I have no fault. I didn’t murder her. Hania’s boyfriend
 shot her in front of my eyes, and the police put the entire blame on me. I don’t know what I would have done, 
had you not come. Those people would have done 
something really bad with me. Ramsha. How could I not come? It was you. I had to come for you at all cost. And I know well that you didn’t do anything. You are being framed in this matter. But I am with you, Ramsha. I will not leave you in this difficult time. And we will get through this. Come on, sit in the car, eat something. I have to say something. What do you want to say? I had lied about everything to you. Whatever I had told you, 
showed you, it was all a lie. And you think whatever you 
had told me about you, I had believed it all, right? I knew you were lying. Afnan… You know, Ramsha what is the best thing about you? Your innocence. You didn’t adopt the colours of the world. So you believe whatever 
anyone says to you. You see the world with your own eyes. You feel that the way you think, 
the world is like that. The eyes with which you
 look at the world, the world operates the same way. But there is nothing like that. Here, everyone tries to 
take advantage of each other. They use each other and then
throw them away like tissue paper. But I am sure, now that you have faltered a little, 
so you will learn. And one more thing, that I had felt about you, 
I will surely tell you that. You have been running 
after materialistic things, without thinking 
what would happen after you get it? Trust me. You get one thing once, then you will get after another,
 and then another. You tell me yourself. Do you have peace in your life and heart? Fine, okay, tell me if you talk to him. Okay. Alizay. Alizay, child, we have to go somewhere in the evening, 
so you dress up quickly. Child, I am saying something to you. I am listening mama. Who are you calling again and again? And you look worried to me too. mama, I am calling Afnan, 
he is not answering my call. So he must be busy, child. What is there to worry in this? That is what is worrying me, that where is he busy that 
he is not even answering my call. I messaged him in the morning, 
he hasn’t replied. Mama, even if he is busy, he replies to me. Where is he today? Child, when he is with you,
you get annoyed. When he goes far, you become restless. What do you want? Mama… Child, he must be busy. When he gets free, he will call you. And be ready early, don’t get late. No, no, Afnan, I cannot go home. You don’t know my parents, 
they won’t let me go back to that home. The doors of that home 
have been closed for me. My father will never let me come, 
he is really short tempered. He will not let me enter the home. No, Ramsha, no. 
There is nothing like that. Why are you being so negative? Look, always remember one thing. Our parents love us unconditionally and they love us till their last breath, 
as much as they loved us on the first day. They worry for us, they get worried for us, that’s why they get upset at times. But this doesn’t mean that 
we cannot go back home. Every person makes a mistake, 
even you made one. And you know what mistake we make? We don’t knock on the door of the home. We don’t even think that the homes 
we are going to without knocking, the people who live there 
are waiting for us to knock. You don’t know my papa, that is why you are saying this. He is really short tempered. I don’t know your papa, but I surely know that if he makes you understand, 
then it is for your betterment. Only because you don’t 
ever get stuck in a trouble. And Ramsha, there are 
so many people in the world, who have no one to love them
 or make them understand. We are lucky, that our family 
worries for us, they want to guide us. And remember, 
not everyone has this blessing. Always remember, the garden 
that doesn’t have a gardener, there fruit and flowers, both die out. Did you talk to Afnan? No. He was saying 
he will call me himself. I am going to talk to brother 
and finalize a date, and now you won’t say anything. Fine, mama. Afnan, I have decided. I won’t go back to my home. What is wrong with you? Stop being stupid. For God’s sake. Don’t be stubborn for no reason. Today, wherever you are it is
 cause of your stubbornness. Go back to your home, quietly. You can say what you want. I know there is no place for me in that home. I will not stay here… Ramsha, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? What do you think of yourself? And what do you think of others? I have been standing here and 
trying to make you understand that this place is not right for you,
you should go back to your home. But you are being stubborn. Ramsha, don’t you remember 
the condition of your friend. Whose stories you had told me. What did that girl get? The boy she went with for her love, 
what did she get? Her life is ruined today and
 did something happen to that boy? No. This world is really selfish. No one cares about anyone. Today, if God forbid 
something happens to you. All these people will just act like 
mere spectators, they will make your video, take pictures and leave. Listen to me. If anyone is affected by something bad happening 
to us, then it is only our family. That’s it. Please, go. Please, Ramsha. Fine. Hello. Where were you all day long today? Man, I had told you, I am with a friend. I don’t know how time passed, and now I am going back home, 
and talking to you. You were busy with a friend? Yes, yes, I was with a friend. The poor thing was in a difficulty, 
time passed trying to fix that problem. And see, you and I didn’t talk all day long 
and even right now you are talking about them. I am surprised. You know, there is something. You are no less than uncle. You are in the forefront 
when it comes to doing charity. Yes, obviously, you will see the colours of blood. After all, if the son doesn’t take up after the father,
then who would they take up after. You know there is something, 
dad is right. The peace and comfort you
 find in helping others, it is nowhere else. Okay, you must get it. 
How would I know? Anyway, leave all this.
 Tell me, when are you coming back? Hey, if you ask me, I will come today. I will come when you ask me. 
Tell me, when should I come? Who is it? Ramsha. Annie. Who is it? Annie? I will go inform elder papa. What have you come here for? What did you come to get? Get out of here. Get lost. Here you go. Elder papa, elder mama, that… Ramsha has come back.
