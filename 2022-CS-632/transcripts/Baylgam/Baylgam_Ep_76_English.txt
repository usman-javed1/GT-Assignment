Brother, fine, you supported Ramsha out of
sympathy earlier as well. You kept her in this home, but now it is not reasonable. What do you want to say, Afsheen? Brother, Afnan and Alizay’s life will
be disturbed cause of Ramsha. And right now, Alizay and Afnan’s happiness
should matter for us. I admit that Ramsha is
really worried, but this can surely not be
the solution for this. Oh God, even you were worried, Afsheen. I supported you. I kept you in this home, I didn’t let you lack anything. Do you remember? Brother, I am your sister. Ramsha is my daughter. The relation made in words
have no importance. It has importance for me. When I was unwell, then who cared for me day
and night? Huh? Who was it who didn’t care
about day and night? It is in front of you. Ramsha stayed up all night. She and I had no relation, but we had a relation of care. Afsheen, relations are
made through care. And the blood relations that have
no care in them are meaningless. Meaning, you think that when that
child needs me, then I send her to a hostel? No, that will not happen. Why do we have such
a big home for? She will stay here. Anyway, there are no other
opinions in this matter. I had no idea all this
would happen with me. I have been cheated so badly. He trapped me in the
name of business and he took all the money from me. I sat there hungry for three days, I had nothing to eat or drink. Thank God I came to Pakistan, so I got saved. That’s why I had told you not to! Don’t go so far. Don’t leave. You ruined all the money, did your heart find peace? Papa, I didn’t know Waseem would do this with me. He looked away from
me going there. Shani, I always used to
make you understand that all your friends are
useless and opportunists, they will cheat you. But you didn’t listen to me at all. This is the limit, papa. I had thought that you
would support me, you would sympathize with me, but you are insulting me. Lower your voice. You chose this path of
destruction for yourself. It is no one else’s fault, Shani. It is all your fault. What is wrong? What argument are you people getting into? What had to happen, has happened. Now don’t blame each other. I had thought I would come to my home, then maybe the family would support me, they would listen to me. I will start everything fresh. But here, they are only insulting me. When you have empty pockets, then no reassurance is of any use. All reassurances given to an
empty hand are useless. Whatever money we had,
you ruined it all. Here the shop is also empty and on top of that Mr. Qasim has
stopped all him support packages. Remember Shani, you didn’t just divorce Ramsha, along with her,
you have ruined all of us. If Ramsha was with us today, then Mr. Qasim would have
supported us in this difficult time, he would have done something. But you got your hands
and feet cut as well, but you also made us
handicapped with you. We are handicapped. He will start fresh! Shani. Shani. Did your bike break down or mister didn’t realize spending
time with loafers, how late he has become. You had to open the shop. I came and opened the shop. All of them were standing outside. When will you realize
your responsibilities? I went to Waseem on the way. My visa for Dubai is here,
I am leaving tomorrow. What? So soon? Yes, papa, so soon. After all, I was tired of
hearing your taunts. It is good, now you take care of
your business yourself. I am going home to pack my bags. So she is responsible for it, Afnan. If she got married to Shani, then she should have compromised
and lived with him. After all, Shani accepted her after
so much happened. Who marries such girls? What happened? Why are
you looking at me like that? You too rejected her. Yes. Maybe that was the biggest
mistake of my life. Brother, Afnan and Alizay’s life will be
disturbed cause of Ramsha. And right now, Alizay and Afnan’s happiness
should matter for us. I admit that Ramsha is really worried, but this can surely not be
the solution for this. Oh God, even you were worried, Afsheen. I supported you. I kept you in this home, I didn’t let you lack anything. Do you remember? Brother, I am your sister. Ramsha is my daughter. The relation made in words
have no importance. It has importance for me. When I was unwell, then who cared for me day
and night? Huh? Who was it who didn’t care
about day and night? It is in front of you. Ramsha stayed up all night. She and I had no relation, but we had a relation of care. Afsheen, relations are
made through care. And the blood relations that have no
care in them are meaningless. Yes, aunt? You called me. Afsheen. How dare you raise your
hand at Ramsha? Aunt? Aunt. What happened? You had called me. I am not your aunt, at all. Do you understand? I have no relation with you. What happened to them? Mama, you are mad after
your brother. You don’t get tired of saying
brother this, brother that, mama. You always worried for him so much. You have always gone around him, but still how did he repay
you for all this? He insulted you for a stranger. Alizay, please, for God’s sake, be quiet. Mama, you are still telling me to be quiet,
after so much happened. He compared you to Ramsha. What would be a greater
insult for us here? Alizay, I cannot believe that brother compared me, that too with Ramsha. He has never spoken to me in
the tone he used with me. This is the same brother, who could give his life for me. That’s why I am so worried
for the past so many days. Anyway, you leave it don’t be so worried. What are you saying? How do I not get worried? I had not even thought that I would see such
a day in this home. You know this girl, Ramsha, has changed everything. She has even changed brother. Brother is not the
same now. Afnan, a person
shouldn’t be so selfish. You didn’t even ask
once how my day was. Hey, so tell me how was your day? I wont tell you. Okay fine, I have kept down the ice cream, I have switched off the phone. Tell me, madam, how was your day? What happened? I had a great day, but you know what happened? A lot of YouTubers came
home to interview me. Oh. Mama didn’t give me permission. You know, I am getting
so many calls, so many messages, people want to meet me, they want to interview, they want to sit and talk to me. They want to know about me. But my family is not
giving me permission. What happened? Afnan, my friend Hania, her boyfriend shot her
with a gun in front of me. She died over there. You know, then police thought that it was my fault, they put me in the lockup. Quiet. Quiet. Be quiet. I am here. Now everything will be fine. What sort of a girl are you, man? You are even talking in this condition. You are talking… Thank you, Afnan. Thank you so much. It is okay, and you are welcome. If like humans, plants too get love and affection, they blossom. See it is the turn of this pot today. You are right, uncle. You know, uncle, I was thinking why don’t
I join the academy? Hey, yes, that is something good. In fact, I will do one thing, I will call the academy, I will talk to them. Really, uncle? This will be great. Thank you so much. Live long. I am saying child,
if I talk to them, then you join the academy
from tomorrow. God bless my father, he used to say that the
one who wastes time, times wastes them. So, every moment is precious when
you are trying to get education, right? You are absolutely right, uncle. Thank you so much. But now stop it, uncle, you are tired. Go and rest for a while, I will do all this. What did I do? You did all the work. Yes, that’s what my age calls for. Okay, this is the last pot, don’t start any other work now. Ramsha. Yes? Where are you going? Why are you going? Why? Do you want something? Why? Now can we only talk when
I want something? Can we not talk apart from that? No. What has happened to you,
Ramsha? I am noticing you are really ignoring me. You ignored me the same
way in the morning, you didn’t even talk to me. If I have made a mistake,
then tell me. If you are upset, if you have any complaints,
then at least say it. I have no complaints. Then why are you doing this? Because I want to stay in this home. I don’t want anyone’s life gets
disturbed because of me. I hope you understand
what I am trying to say. Greetings. Greetings. One minute Afnan. Huh? What is this? What? Where did you get soil in
your coat from? I…actually… I will tell you. Ramsha put this soil. I had seen it on her hand. No, no, you are taking it wrong. You have a misunderstanding… I am not understanding
anything wrong, Afnan. I couldn’t even imagine
you could fall so low. You two have crossed all the limits. What nonsense is this? I am not speaking nonsense. I am speaking the truth. You are spending time with that
cheap girl leaving your wife? Shut up. Just shut up! If you say anything cheap after this, I will not spend a moment
with you after that. Brother, did you call me? Greetings. Greetings. Afsheen, doesn’t have
some necessities. You go to the market with her. She will get what she wants. Okay? Yes, fine brother. I will go. Then just get ready. I spoke to her, when she comes then you go. Okay? Sure. Now just buy necessary things. If things are being distributed for free, this doesn’t mean that you
get what you want. I had said no to uncle, he insisted and sent me with you. Yes. You are really innocent. He told you and you went, right? I can see how you are robbing my brother. Why did you stop? Stop these dramas. Stop crying. I don’t want to get anything. I want to go home. Come on. When you didn’t want to get anything, then why did you bring me here? Stop these dramas of yours. If you get empty handed like this, then brother will feel that maybe I told you not to get anything. Get the things you need and come home. I don’t have time for
these dramas of yours, then we will go home. Come on, quickly. Ramsha! Take these bags and put them in the room. Okay, madam. Aunt, for a moment, I felt I would lose my life. That car crossed so close from me, I felt that someone was trying to kill me on purpose. No, no, why would anyone kill you 
on purpose, Ramsha? You know people have
 no manners to drive. No aunt, whether you accept it or not, whoever was in it wanted to 
take my life on purpose. They did this on purpose, so that I… No Ramsha, that was just an accident. You don’t think so much. I don’t know, aunt. I feel someone did all this on purpose. I… Ramsha, don’t mention this to brother or Afnan. Look, they will worry for no reason. Greetings. Greetings. All okay, you came early. Yes, aunt, the meetings
ended soon today, so that’s why. What happened? All okay? Yes. Yes. Everything is okay. I took her shopping, so she is tired. Ramsha, you go to
your room and rest. Sure. Will you have tea? If you are making tea,
then I will have it. Yes, let me just change,
then I will make it. Greetings. What happened? Why are you looking
at me like that? Where are you coming from? From the office. You are lying. You didn’t go to the office today. Why would I lie to you? I am coming from the office, right now. What is wrong? You got the attack made
on Ramsha, right? Attack? What attack? I don’t know about any attack. You know well what attack
I am talking about. I recognized your car. It was you, right? I am asking you something. Yes, I was the one who attacked. But she has good luck, she survived this time. Next time this wont happen, I promise you. Alizay, you want to kill her? Mama, if I could I will kill
her right this moment. Because if she lives then me and Afnan can
 never be happy. Alizay, stupid girl, what do you think? You will kill Ramsha and you feel you will come
 closer to Afnan like this? Nothing like this will happen. If Afnan even gets 
a hint of your thinking, then he will not even hate you, 
love is out of question. Then what do I do, mama? You tell me. I cannot see him going close 
to Ramsha with my own eyes. I will die. Mama, I will die without him. I will die, mama, Do you understand me? I cannot see this. I cannot see Afnan becoming someone else’s. Then what do I do, mama? You tell me. I cannot see him going close to
 Ramsha with my own eyes. Do you understand 
what I am saying? If Afnan, gets close to Ramsha, I will die. I will die, mama, Do you understand me? I admit that Ramsha is 
really worried, but this can surely not be 
the solution for this. Oh God, even you were worried, Afsheen. I supported you. I kept you in this home, I didn’t let you lack anything. Do you remember? Brother, I am your sister. Ramsha is my daughter. The relation made in 
words have no importance. It has importance for me. And the blood relations that have
 no care in them are meaningless. Hello.
