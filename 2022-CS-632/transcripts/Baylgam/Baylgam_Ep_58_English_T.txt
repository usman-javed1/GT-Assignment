[20.60] Hello. Greetings.
[23.48] How are you? Are you fine?
[26.12] Really?
[28.20] Congratulations to you.
[40.32] Yes, yes, I will inform brother.
[54.20] Okay.
[55.64] You take a lot care of Ramsha.
[64.00] Fine.
[65.84] Congratulations brother,
[67.68] Ramsha is pregnant.
[76.28] Congratulations to you too.
[86.20] This is a good news.
[90.00] She was saying that I tell you 
to pray for her a lot.
[99.68] May God make everything better.
[101.56] I will pray. Why will I not pray?
[112.88] You do one thing,
[114.84] call Ramsha and congratulate her.
[117.48] She will like it.
[127.48] I am going to the mosque for prayers.
Come on, Afnan. Let’s go.
[147.24] This is the limit.
[149.36] They were getting so happy hearing 
the news about Ramsha,
[152.84] like happiness has come 
to their home.
[156.44] I will tell Alizeh to focus 
on making her family.
[161.80] She is a really stupid girl,
[163.64] who is putting her family on the line 
for her career.
[175.28] Mr. Asad, I will share your terms and 
conditions with dad as well,
[179.52] and I hope that dad too will approve it 
and we will work together soon.
[183.84] Thank you so much, Afnan.
[186.28] So, then I will wait for your answer.
[222.68] Alizeh. 
Yes?
[225.20] I was thinking that
[227.28] why don’t we shop for Ramsha’s future baby
 and go to their home.
[235.12] Afnan, there are other things to do in 
this world apart from making Ramsha happy.
[246.88] I am not saying this.
[255.24] Dad said that someone from 
our home should go.
[259.20] Aunt won’t go, so you and I will go.
[262.12] You know, uncle has the habit of giving
 everyone importance.
[278.08] After all, what has happened 
that all of us go to her home?
[314.96] What happened? Why are you 
staring at me like that?
[316.68] What did I say?
[325.48] I don’t understand
[327.20] why did her mother-in-law tell uncle 
about this?
[330.56] I mean, we have other work in 
our life apart from Ramsha.
[340.16] They are weird people.
[381.12] Come. Come, 
child. Come on.
[385.52] Have a seat. You came alone?
[388.04] Dad had specifically told me after 
hearing Ramsha’s good news,
[394.72] that I should surely bring 
something for her.
[396.80] I left the office and your home was nearby,
I thought I would come.
[402.44] Hey,
[404.40] son, you did good that you came.
[409.08] I will call Ramsha,
[411.52] when she sees all this herself, 
she will be really happy. You sit.
[431.16] Hello.
[432.28] Hello.
[433.76] Greetings.
[435.12] Greetings.
[436.36] Where are you?
[447.36] Afnan, I asked you, where are you?
[450.96] In the office, where else?
[453.12] Oh,
[455.00] I thought you wouldn’t have 
left home till now.
[463.48] Actually, I got free from the office 
before time,
[466.32] so I thought I would ask you.
[474.32] Okay, then I am going to Tania’s home,
[476.00] you pick me up on your way home.
[477.60] What will I do going home? 
You won’t be there.
[480.24] Fine. Bye.
[482.08] Okay tell me when…
[485.20] He is a weird man.
[486.48] He cuts the call without listening to me.
[499.04] He didn’t tell me when he will pick me.
[501.96] I will call him again when
 I reach Tania’s home.
[506.48] Driver, take me to Tania’s home.
[511.68] What was the need to bring 
so many things?
[514.36] Right now, even we have not 
even started shopping,
[516.44] and you brought so much.
[518.72] No matter how much you get 
for children, it is always less.
[533.00] Then dad asked me, 
and you know dad well.
[536.60] I have to do what he says.
[547.08] And I left the office, we had a 
really good baby shop next door,
[551.24] I went there and got all the things 
I liked.
[561.56] Okay child, you people sit and talk.
[564.16] I will go make tea and come.
[565.76] Hey, no need to bring tea.
I will leave.
[569.36] You sit, I will go make tea.
[571.04] No child, you people sit and talk.
 I will go and make tea.
[613.00] How are you?
[615.08] Yes, I am fine.
[624.80] I am happy too.
[629.92] Everyone really cares for me.
[643.72] How is uncle?
[646.64] He is absolutely fine.
[652.76] Everyone really…
[656.68] dad really misses you.
[665.08] He was saying he really wants 
to meet you,
[668.08] he will come in a day or two.
[674.68] How is Shani?
[684.68] Is everything fine with you?
[689.76] He is really good too…
[691.60] Greetings.
[693.76] Greetings.
[742.04] Hey,
[743.52] son you stood up to leave. 
I took too long to make tea.
[746.96] Hey aunty, there was no need for tea,
I was just leaving.
[750.56] No, you cannot leave without having tea.
Come on, sit down.
[754.64] Aunty, you are embarrassing me.
[757.04] I have a really important meeting, 
or else I would have surely stayed.
[759.40] When I come next time,
I will surely have tea.
[761.52] I will go now. 
Okay.
[762.88] Goodbye. 
Goodbye son.
[790.60] Take care of yourself, 
Ramsha.
[796.44] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[847.80] Why did Afnan come here?
[850.28] He came to meet.
[854.52] Who?
[859.80] What do you mean who?
[862.04] He came to meet all of us.
[868.64] And uncle had sent sweets 
and some things,
[871.12] he brought those.
[882.24] So Mr. Qasim couldn’t come himself?
[890.44] Huh?
[891.68] If he had to give things,
[894.20] he could have come himself. 
What does he think?
[897.00] What is wrong, Shani?
[898.72] You know uncle is unwell, 
how could he come?
[907.28] And Afnan was saying that 
uncle has said that when he gets better,
[910.24] he will visit himself.
[912.84] Okay,
[915.40] and this Afnan?
[917.64] Why did he come alone? Could he 
not have come with his wife?
[920.64] And when he had come,
[922.04] then what was the need for him 
to come inside
[923.72] and what was the need for you 
to go there and sit with him?
[926.60] No, I was not sitting alone, 
aunt was sitting with me.
[935.28] Aunt went to make tea and 
I was sitting with him.
[942.60] Whatever it is,
[945.68] I don’t like him coming 
alone here at all.
[957.64] Do you understand?
[962.12] Fine, I will tell him. 
Don’t get angry.
[1005.92] How are you?
[1008.04] Yes, I am fine.
[1015.68] I am happy too.
[1017.76] Everyone really cares for me.
[1021.04] How is Shani?
[1023.12] Is everything fine with you?
[1028.12] He is really good too…
[1041.32] Ramsha is calling at this hour?
[1045.96] Hello. Greetings.
[1047.12] Greetings. Afnan, I…
[1049.40] What happened Ramsha? All okay?
Why are you calling at this hour?
[1052.88] Yes, I wanted to talk to you 
about something important.
[1056.72] Yes, go ahead.
[1058.60] I actually wanted to say that
[1061.08] whenever you come next to 
our home, then please,
[1063.52] come with Alizeh or aunt.
[1072.00] Shani doesn’t like you coming here
 like this.
[1076.28] Why? What happened?
[1079.60] I just came there to give you, 
your things.
[1094.60] Fine, after today I will not come alone.
[1104.56] Had I known Shani has so much 
objection on me coming over,
[1109.76] then I would never have come.
[1122.92] But I will be careful in future.
[1125.08] Bye.
[1129.96] You lied to me and went to 
that girl’s home to meet her?
[1138.28] Aren’t you ashamed Afnan?
[1140.16] What is in her that she is not 
leaving your heart?
[1144.36] What is wrong with you?
[1146.76] Why do you start saying these things
 in a minute?
[1149.80] You start putting allegations on me
and Ramsha.
[1152.84] I am not putting allegations. 
I am speaking the truth.
[1155.44] The truth you and her are 
not ready to accept.
[1158.84] She acts really pure,
[1160.84] but now when she is married,
[1163.08] still she is not giving up her actions.
[1165.28] That’s it. You have said enough.
[1168.24] If someone else had put all these 
allegations apart from you,
[1171.72] then I would have taken their life.
[1175.56] Thank God you are standing here.
[1252.52] My head is hurting.
[1257.40] Shani.
[1258.96] My head is hurting. 
My head is hurting bad.
[1261.96] Shani, I just gave you medication,
[1264.72] your headache will get better. 
I will massage your head.
[1268.44] Wait.
[1270.72] Close your eyes, try to sleep.
[1273.48] You will be fine, just now.
[1284.28] Ramsha.
[1287.28] Yes. Yes. Yes. I am coming.
[1291.28] Greetings.
[1292.32] Greetings, child, you have not slept?
[1295.40] Seeing your condition I feel that 
you have been awake all night.
[1297.36] How is he doing?
[1298.48] Shani was unwell all night long.
[1303.92] He had such high fever. I have been 
putting cold compress all night.
[1307.24] He was still saying he has a headache.
[1310.08] Child that is fine, 
but you should have rested.
[1314.80] If you don’t rest in this condition,
[1317.56] then you will get unwell.
[1320.28] Had I woken you people up,
[1321.64] you people would have gotten 
disturbed too.
[1330.36] And after all,
[1332.96] I was with Shani.
[1335.48] Even I couldn’t sleep seeing him
in this condition.
[1338.52] That’s why.
[1341.60] Okay, come on, I am going 
to make breakfast.
[1344.76] You come on, 
Shani is sleeping right now.
[1347.08] Okay? Come on, come child. 
Live long.
[1400.40] You lied to me and went to 
that girl’s home to meet her?
[1403.72] Aren’t you ashamed Afnan?
[1405.56] What is in her that 
she is not leaving your heart?
[1413.48] Hey, Afnan,
[1416.56] you are having breakfast alone.
 Where is Alizeh?
[1420.36] She is sleeping!
[1423.16] What is this? Today is Sunday,
[1426.24] you people should have 
breakfast together, right?
[1428.72] You should make Alizeh 
understand this aunt.
[1440.20] Alizeh’s behaviour has really changed.
[1448.96] Had I woken her up for breakfast 
she would have misbehaved with me,
[1452.00] fought with me.
[1459.40] So I thought it is right that 
I have breakfast alone.
[1463.20] What happened?
[1464.36] Did you two fight?
[1470.40] Why are you in such a bad mood?
[1474.20] Now, this doesn’t seem like 
something new.
[1477.28] Alizeh is always in a bad mood.
[1483.12] You say something against 
her temperament,
[1486.24] she cannot tolerate it.
[1488.72] She becomes hyper.
[1492.48] You know Alizeh since childhood.
[1497.04] You know her temperament.
[1503.20] Don’t do the things she doesn’t like.
[1506.08] Aunty, you know well how much 
I care for her likes and dislikes.
[1522.16] But her habits have become bad too.
[1531.60] It feels like only she can put 
restrictions on me,
[1536.12] but if I put restrictions on her, 
she cannot tolerate it.
[1549.96] You make her understand.
[1553.24] What do you think? 
I don’t make her understand?
[1564.72] I make her understand
[1566.56] and I am also trying to make you 
understand as well.
[1578.52] You two have only been married 
for a year, Afnan
[1582.48] and so many differences.
[1584.40] How will things work out in future?
[1587.40] I don’t know, aunt.
[1590.00] You will have to ask this from Alizeh.
[1597.28] Excuse me.
[1620.12] What is this?
[1622.60] Breakfast.
[1625.04] I want to have a fried flatbread. 
Tell Ramsha to make me a fried flatbread.
[1627.24] Where is she?
[1628.48] Hey, she just slept. 
Let her sleep.
[1631.96] And quit eating these fried flatbreads
 right now.
[1639.68] What are you looking at? 
Have your breakfast.
[1644.60] Shani, you don’t have to eat 
fried flatbreads for two to four days.
[1649.28] The doctor has told you 
to have light food.
[1652.32] And I will make you porridge or oats.
[1655.24] The way you were feeling last night,
[1657.76] your papa and I got scared.
[1659.84] Your fever wasn’t going down.
[1661.56] It was poor Ramsha’s courage
[1664.20] that she sat with you all night long.
[1666.32] She kept on cold compress on your 
forehead all night long in this condition.
[1669.72] She sat with you all night long 
and took care of you.
[1673.24] That is why you are sitting fine over here.
[1677.44] Your papa and I had gone to sleep 
after giving you medication.
[1688.60] That poor thing showed the strength.
[1690.24] That girl stayed up because of 
you all night long.
[1696.60] I don’t know what you are saying.
[1700.16] Yes, how would you know. 
You had such high fever.
[1703.84] You were suffering from high fever.
[1708.64] But that girl sat with you all night long
because of you,
[1712.60] even in this condition and Shani,
[1715.12] only lucky people get such wives.
[1717.96] Know her worth. 
Know her worth.
[1721.48] Have your breakfast.
[1776.28] Come Shani, move your feet.
[1778.40] Here, I have made soup. 
Drink the soup.
[1781.56] What is this?
Soup.
[1784.20] Have you people gone mad?
[1786.80] Even in the morning you people 
gave me tea and rusk,
[1789.36] and you are feeding me soup right now.
What is wrong with you people?
[1792.32] We want that you get fine,
[1794.20] that is why we are feeding 
you such food.
[1795.68] Come on. Drink the soup quickly.
Take it or else…
[1798.00] Or else what?
[1799.60] Or else I will turn it on your head.
[1801.60] You are not that cruel.
[1803.28] Look, now you are making me angry
and you know how bad my anger is.
[1806.76] and you also know 
how stubborn I am.
[1808.76] So you will have to drink this soup.
Come on.
[1813.56] Mama made this tasteless soup, right?
[1816.80] That’s why it is so tasteless.
[1818.96] I mean, just add water to the soup, 
boil and feed it.
[1825.96] Thank God mama didn’t become 
a doctor,
[1827.48] or else she would have done 
her practice on us.
[1830.80] You are so ill-mannered.
[1833.04] What nonsense are you speaking?
[1835.04] A mother really feels for her children.
[1837.56] A mother really cares for her children.
[1840.52] You don’t realize this today,
[1842.56] but in future when you become a father,
[1844.60] then your child would be unwell, 
you will realize
[1847.92] what taking care of the children is like.
[1849.84] Come on, now here you go, 
drink the soup. Drink it.
[1855.04] I am just drinking it for you.
[1859.32] Good. Come on.
[1862.12] Give it. 
I am feeding you.
[1868.16] Oh ho.
[1870.36] Shani, finish it quickly.
[1873.20] You are really stubborn.
[1912.84] What had to happen, has happened,
[1915.56] why are you blaming all of us?
[1918.12] First of all, talk to me with respect.
[1919.96] Right now, I am really upset.
[1929.32] Afnan, there are other things to do in 
this world apart from making Ramsha happy.
[1938.08] I am not saying this.
[1941.60] Dad said that someone from 
our home should go.
[1945.20] Aunt won’t go, so me and you will go.
[1953.12] Aren’t you ashamed Afnan?
[1954.96] What is in her that she is not leaving
 your heart?
[1959.20] What is wrong with you?
[1961.88] Why do you start saying 
these things in a minute?
[1964.68] You start putting allegations on me
and Ramsha.
[1967.76] I am not putting allegations.
I am speaking the truth.
[1970.40] The truth you and her are
not ready to accept.
[1973.76] She acts really pure,
[1975.68] but now when she is married,
[1978.08] still she is not giving up her actions.
[1980.24] That’s it. You have said enough.
[1983.16] If someone else had put all these 
allegations apart from you,
[1986.48] then I would have taken their life.
[1997.64] You have even stopped convincing me.
[2001.28] You didn’t convince me even once.
[2024.24] Shani,
[2025.60] you have really high fever.
[2030.96] I will go and call uncle, 
you go to the doctor.
[2033.64] You will feel better. 
No Ramsha.
[2046.56] Stay here with me. 
Don’t go from here.
[2058.08] Look Shani,
[2060.56] you have really high fever.
[2062.80] If you don’t go to the doctor, 
you will get unwell further.
[2065.40] How will you get better, then?
[2068.72] Ramsha, if you go from here, 
I will feel restless.
[2076.32] Just stay with me.
[2140.20] What is happening to me?
[2142.56] I am unable to focus in any work.
[2145.52] And it is just 2 pm right now.
[2166.00] When will it be 10 pm,
[2169.52] it is just 2 pm right now. 
There is so much time till 10 pm.
[2173.92] When will I go home?
[2196.24] Greetings.
[2199.00] Greetings.
[2200.72] Yes, aunt is in the kitchen, 
I will just put her on the phone. Wait.
[2202.92] I don’t want to talk to mama.
[2207.48] I want to talk to you.
[2211.16] Me?
[2212.92] Why?
[2215.00] Are you not allowed to talk to me?
[2220.48] Can you not talk on the phone?
[2223.04] No. No. You never called me.
[2226.92] You just called, so I thought 
you want to talk to aunt.
[2237.64] You are fine, right? 
You are feeling okay, right?
[2242.16] Yes, I am fine.
[2248.60] There was no rush at the shop today,
[2251.76] I thought I would ask how you are.
[2258.76] You are not fine nowadays,
[2261.52] so I worry for you.
[2266.56] Okay.
[2278.80] Hello?
[2280.36] Hello.
[2281.52] Yes, go ahead. 
I am listening.
[2286.60] You went quiet, so I thought 
the call got disconnected.
[2292.80] You too became quiet.
[2302.36] Ramsha, I…
[2304.52] I wanted to talk to you 
about something.
[2308.80] Yes, go ahead.
[2312.92] I…
[2315.68] I…
[2328.96] I will talk to you later.
[2334.00] Okay, goodbye.
[2337.52] Goodbye.
