It’s none of your business, 
who was I talking to? What is this question? You were talking to some girl, right? Ramsha, I don’t like it at all that anyone asks me what and 
why was I doing anything, do you understand? And you should talk to another girl 
when I am here? You ignore me, fight with me, 
get angry at me, do I like all this? Have you ever thought about this? Ramsha, don’t spoil my mood, accidentally I am in a good mood 
today, don’t ruin it. So that is what I am asking, 
why are you in such a good mood? You never get in such a good mood
when you look at me, you just fight with me all the time. 
Do you know what? The truth is, I am fed up with you, I am bored of you. Now do you understand? Why do you always become the reason
behind tears in my eyes, Shani? Okay enough now, you start crying over every little thing and just because of this crying face, 
I have become fed up. So, have you ever thought 
why do I cry, Shani? What kind of a husband are you, Shani? I am your wife, my sorrow, my pain, doesn’t mean anything to you? Husband and wife are each 
other’s clothes, Shani, they are each other’s support system, I am still very lonely and alone despite
of having you in my life. Do you understand why I don’t come 
into the room at night? Why do I leave? Hello? The money has been arranged. 
Where do I have to come? I said don’t talk rubbish, tell me 
where do I have to come? It is a total 20 lac rupees, 
you can count if you want to. There is no need to count, they must be 
complete but tell me something, how did you arrange such a huge 
in such less time? Hmm? What do you have to do with that? No, no, I was just asking, now at least your husband cannot 
give you such a huge amount, so I am sure you must have taken it
from someone you know, I understand this much, so tell me who did this favour on you? Whoever did it, I have never seen a bigger moron 
than you in my life, I hope that you will keep your moron 
self a secret and won’t show it off. Delete it. Why are you looking at me like this? 
Delete it. Actually, I forgot to bring 
my mobile phone and I don’t have my laptop in my car. But don’t worry, you just be satisfied, I hope 
you trust me that much. Come, let’s have tea somewhere. Hey? Hey? What option did I have except 
to give him money? I am helpless and I have 
to trust this moron. Oh God, take me out of this problem, what trouble have I gotten into? I had no idea that the mistakes I made 
in the past would become hell for me. Ramsha? Since I have been sitting here, 
I am just noticing that you are continuously looking 
at your phone, after all, what is there in your phone? I am just looking at the fact that 
how easy has it become to sin. What do you mean? Our mistakes and out-of-control desires
have made committing sin so easy, we didn’t even realize it. I didn’t get it, 
what are you trying to say? Do you know, Annie? People had to plan before sinning first, they had to spend money, and snatch money from people and now this little lifeless piece has become 
an easy way for people to sin. Now people don’t have 
to spend their money, they don’t have to snatch money 
from people either, and they don’t even have 
to take a wrong step to sin, in fact, just by clicking on 
this lifeless piece, any sin can be committed. The people have added poison 
in our lives and our upcoming generations, 
in the name of entertainment, it is very difficult to save yourself 
from it. I wish our parents would have 
restricted us. Mom and dad stopped me so much but I, I didn’t even realize, I realize it today, I wish Mom and Dad would have
restricted my pointless wishes. I wish I would have been saved 
from this temptation. Annie, I have decided that when God bless me with a child, I will restrict my child, I will keep my child away 
from this temptation that has been given to us 
in the name of technology, very far. Hey? Asim. Hey, Asim, how did you think of me? Where are you right now? I am at the shop, working. Can you come to me right now? I Just told you that I am at work, 
working, dad is here too. Let’s sit somewhere and talk, there is something very important 
that I need to tell you. Tell me what is it? Dude, it is regarding 
sister-in-law Ramsha. okay, fine, I am coming. Dad, I have some important work, 
I will be back in a while. Are you in your senses? You even know that 
the boys are off today, I have work load here and 
I cannot do it all alone. Do your work, go. Sha.. Sha… Shani? Shani? What a useless child, it would have been better… Oh Dude, he left the work 
in the middle. How are you? 
I am fine. Why have you called me here? Asim didn’t call you, I did. So, you did? Yes, I wanted to talk to you about 
something important. Sit down. Hi sir, I am Ramsha. did you get scared? No, sir, I am not scared of anyone. Actually, I didn’t expect you to come
into my room without knocking. Sorry, I came because I wanted you to wear that dress 
and show it to me, the one that I bought for you. Why? I mean, are we going somewhere? No. I want to see you in that dress, so hurry up and get ready and come, I am waiting. Okay sir. When I saw you for the first time, I was able to figure out that one day you will become 
a huge star. That is why I have even 
spoken to Shahmeer. Sit down. How do you know my wife? Knowing looks like a very small 
and common word, anyway, no problem, Asim didn’t tell you in detail, right? What details? Wait a second, I have proofs. Look, look at this video. Afnan, what have you done to the room? Your clothes are messed up 
everywhere, where should I sit? I just came back from the office and I don’t
know I was shocked to see it, what is this? What should I do? I cannot find my grey suit, 
I have been late, I had to be somewhere, 
please take it out for me. What do I know where your suit is? Tabassum keeps your clothes 
in place, she would know it. And she is off today anyway, I will ask her when she 
comes back tomorrow. Please wear something else 
right now and go clean the room. You are my wife, not Tabassum that I should ask everything 
to Tabassum. I gave my suit for dry cleaning, you should have kept it 
when it came back. Now go and find it for me. Afnan, please, 
don’t talk like a fool with me. I am not being a fool, I am reminding you about your work. And if you come very tired from 
the office, it is not my fault. If this house is causing you trouble 
so then go back to the office. What the hell, Afnan? I came early from the office 
so I can rest for a while, I have a headache but I don’t have any peace
in this house too. So I told you the solution, you may go and find your solution, I will solve my problem here, myself. You have been going mad yourself
and you are going to make me mad too. My suit. Leave it, you can’t take it out,
I will look for it myself. What the hell? What rubbish is this? Don’t make me a fool, this is all fake. When brother Danish told me 
about sister-in-law Ramsha, even I thought this is false but it is true, my friend. What’s true in it? You think I am a kid? Do I live in some ancient times
 that I don’t know everything like this can be 
made nowadays. And you must have some shame too. Aren’t you ashamed of talking rubbish 
regarding my wife? What grudge do you have with her? You must ask this question to 
yourself instead of me. What grudge can I have 
with your wife? If I had to defame any girl, is your wife the only one left 
in this whole world? I can even defame any other girl. My friend, try to understand sister-in-law is not a nice woman. Shut the hell up. Enough is enough, 
do you understand? Okay I admit, all this is fake and a lie, but you do accept that your wife went viral by the name
 of Shopping Girl? And then she even eloped from her house? 
I know it very well, what do you think I don’t know all this?
 And yes, acting was her hobby, she left her house for a while 
and went with a friend. You are such a fool. I am sorry but you are a big fool who married a girl like Ramsha. She didn’t go to her friend but was with me, in my home for 
so many days, in Islamabad. Shut your rubbish, 
I won’t tolerate it anymore. Okay, fine, fine. If you don’t believe in these pictures 
and videos, that is fine, but if you want to increase your suffering 
then I have no objection. I will give you proof myself, 
regarding your wife and that too, live. Look here and tell me, do you have the courage? 
Do you? Now don’t make the mistake of going
 and asking all this to your wife, else she will make you 
a fool all your life. Now go and wait. You are such a fool. I am sorry but you are a big fool who married a girl like Ramsha. She didn’t go to her friend but was with me, in my home 
for so many days, in Islamabad. Shani, where were you?
Do you know uncle has been waiting for you for so long
and was getting angry at you. Do one thing, freshen up,
I will serve food for you, okay? I am not hungry. If you don’t believe in these pictures 
and videos, that is fine, but if you want to increase your 
suffering then I have no objection. I will give you proof myself, 
regarding your wife and that too, live. Look here and tell me, do you have the courage? 
Do you? Why do you want to meet me now? You said you will take the money 
and delete the pictures then, so now why do you want 
to meet me? Now delete my pictures and 
stop being after my life. You are being angry for no reason, I just want to delete them 
in front of you. That is why just come to meet me once, and this will be last time. Whether the pictures get deleted 
in front of me or behind my back, the only thing that matters to me is 
that they should be deleted and you stop being after my life. That is why I am asking you 
to come just one last time, if you won’t come. Now you are backing out from 
your words, Danish Kamal. This is not right. If you actually want to get rid of me 
then I am sure that you will come, 
you will definitely come. Okay, that’s it, I am waiting for you now. Come soon. Bye, bye, bye.
