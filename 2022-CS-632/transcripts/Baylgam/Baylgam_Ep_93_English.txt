Ramsha? Ramsha, please listen to me, 
Ramsha? Ramsha, open the door, please. Ramsha, I know this is wrong with you 
but what should I do? I am helpless. Ramsha? Okay, don’t open the door, I am a fool to be making 
so much effort. I am leaving. Bye. Greetings, brother Jamshed, you here at this time? 
Is everything okay? Madam Ramsha, that Afnan… Sir Afnan had an accident. What? How? I have just got a call from home, 
his car met an accident. Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha? Hello? 
Hello, brother Jamshed, Madam Ramsha is not home, 
has she gone somewhere? I have been ringing her doorbell for 
so long she is not opening the door. No, no, she is at home, 
you ring the doorbell again. Okay I will ring the doorbell again 
and see, I will also wait for a while, she might be 
in the washroom. Okay fine, bye. Madam Ramsha? What happened? 
You are still standing here, did Madam Ramsha not 
open the door yet? No she is not opening the door, 
I have been standing here for so long. Brother Jamshed, I think there is 
something wrong. Do one thing, call Sir Afnan. Yes, right. What happened? 
Is he not picking up? He is not well. Okay do one thing, a gatekeeper 
is sitting downstairs, you call him he might be able
to do something. Okay, don’t worry, Sir Afnan has 
given me a duplicate key of this flat. You are the limit, 
you thought of it so soon! Quickly open the door. Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha, Madam Ramsha, get up. Afnan, you don’t care about me at all, you didn’t even call me for 
once after going home, I kept on waiting for you all night, 
you didn’t call me at night either and now that it’s morning, 
now you have thought of me. I, actually, didn’t get time to call, and I had no idea you would 
take this to your heart. You actually had no idea how I 
would come back from there? Do you know I have never felt 
so lonely, Afnan. If Alizey is your wife, I am your wife too. Hey, when did I deny that? Okay at least stop crying, 
I am coming back, okay? Afnan, what happened? Do you need something? No, no, I just was just feeling weakness,
I guess because of that. Doctor has recommended
 bed rest to you, give me your phone here. What? But I need to make 
an important call. look Doctor has asked you 
to completely rest for now. In fact, let me do one thing, 
let me switch off this phone, you won’t have the phone and 
you won’t make any calls. And what about the office updates, 
Alizey? Afnan, all this can be done later too. Don’t do any work for now at all. Mr Ahmed at the office, 
I spoke to him in the morning, and he was saying whatever work 
will be there related to office, he will keep on updating me, I will let you know myself 
if there is anything important, so please don’t worry and 
you just rest. Yes, but there are some documents that I need to tell him where they are, 
he doesn’t know where they are. Afnan, I think you should just 
rest right now. Leave all this, nothing will be ruined, everything 
will be done on time, hmm? Do you have a headache too? So then please, rest. Sleep for a while, I have your phone with me, okay? I cannot live such a life, where every moment of life is a lie, this double life is very difficult to live. I married you and kept you here, kept you deprived of all your rights. I even feel embarrassed by 
making eye contact with you. You are regretting marrying me,
right? What are you saying? How can you even think that? If I regret anything, it is when I didn’t believe what you said, I wish, I wish I had believed you, I wouldn’t have to go through 
this trouble today. Now I feel that I have done 
a robbery or something that I am trying to hide by 
running away from people. I bother you a lot, right? I am not bothered by you but my life, no one is happy, no matter how hard I try someone is sad, look at Alizey, when I go to her, she fights, 
me gets angry and complain, I don’t know how to cater 
to her complaints. Afnan, Alizey is your wife, like I don’t have anyone in 
my life except you, very similarly, Alizey and Aunt Afsheen
don’t have anyone except you in their life. Madam Ramsha, please have this juice. I am not hungry, I don’t want 
to eat or drink anything. Please have something, you fainted because of not 
eating anything. You will feel weakness that way. Sir will get well by God’s will. Why are you hurting yourself 
by being concerned for him? Madam Ramsha, 
how are you feeling now? Let me know if you need something. I need Afnan. Brother Jamshed, you make me meet Afnan. I know that you will definitely 
make me meet Afnan. You just make me meet him once and 
it will be like a favor for life on me. What are you saying madam? We are your servants. How can we do any favors to you? I beg you, I just want to meet Afnan for once, 
just make me meet him once. Madam, please don’t do that. Okay, I will find a solution. Don’t do this, please. Madam Ramsha, have this juice, please. Have something, don’t hurt yourself 
out of concern for him. I want to meet Afnan. Yes Nazo, so tell me, 
is everything okay? When are you coming back? Okay we will meet when you come back. Okay I will talk to you later. 
Okay, okay. Bye. What happened, Alizey? Mom, I am tired, I am unable to take care 
of Afnan anymore. Obviously, you are in such condition, 
in fact, you need care yourself. I can understand. I even asked Afnan that I will hire
a male nurse for him but he refused. He is saying I am absolutely fine now though you know he is still unable 
to sleep at night because of pain. I can’t see it, 
I have stay awake for him. I have so much headache 
since morning today, Thank God I don’t have to 
go to the office. Don’t worry Alizey, Afnan is way better now 
by the grace of God, everything will be fine, my child. Mom, I have no strength at all, can you give breakfast to him please? Yes, yes, why not? In fact, you rest here 
I will see if Afnan needs something I will give it to him, okay? Afnan, all this can be done later too. Don’t do any work for now at all. Mr Ahmed at the office, I spoke to him in the morning, and he was saying whatever work 
will be there related to office, he will keep on updating me, I will let you know myself 
if there is anything important, so please don’t worry 
and you just rest. Yes, but there are some documents that I need to tell him where they are, 
he doesn’t know where they are. Afnan, I think you should just 
rest right now. Leave all this, 
nothing will be ruined, everything will be done on time, 
hmm? Do you have a headache too? So then please, rest. Sleep for a while, I have your phone with me, okay? Rasheeda? Rasheed, listen to me. What happened? 
Is everything okay? Yes everything is okay 
I have a work from you. What work? No No Rasheed, 
I cannot take this risk, don’t you know Madam Alizey’s anger? If she gets a slight clue, there will be so much trouble
in the house. I can’t do it. nothing will happen, do you trust me? Look keep me away from this matter. okay, just rethink, you have so many work from me and I will also say the same at that time
to keep me away from your matters. And don’t forget how worried were you, your husband had no job, I asked Boss and got him work 
at Brother Hussain’s workshop. Look, don’t put so much stress 
on your brain, go inside, I am bringing her. Go. Rasheeda, take soup for Afnan in his room. Sure. Who is she? Umm, she is my Uncle’s daughter, 
she is a guest from the village. So you brought her here? Madam, the work has increased around 
the house since boss got unwell, so, Abida is even on leave now. I have just brought her for today, she won’t bother you, 
just don’t worry she won’t go anywhere
from the kitchen. But why is she covering 
her face like this? Actually my Uncle is very strict and her fiancé is very punctual 
about covering too. So, why is she hiding her face 
like this here, as if there are so many men here,
tell her to remove this. Listen? Madam, I have given the car at the workshop, 
we will get it back in the evening. Okay. Rasheeda, do one thing, send 
two cups of tea to Mom’s room. Okay. Thank God, we are saved. Madam Ramsha, take soup 
in Sir Afnan’s room, I will make tea for Madam Alizey. Go. Who are you? Ramsha? Ramsha, how are you here? 
Afnan, Afnan how are you? 
Are you well? Where did you get hurt? Afnan, how, how did this all happen?
Afnan you… I am absolutely fine, 
I met an accident Ramsha, I am sorry I didn’t have 
my phone on me So I couldn’t tell you but how come 
you are here and all this? I feel sad about myself, you went through so much difficulty 
and came here to meet me and I, I couldn’t even inform you 
about this, I know you love me a lot 
but I am absolutely fine, I am absolutely fine, nothing 
has happened to me, it’s just a matter of few days, everything will be back to normal 
like before, you just go from here. No, no, no, I won’t go anywhere 
from here, Afnan, I can’t leave you and go anywhere, I will stay close to you and 
take care of you and all this has happened 
because of me anyway, Afnan. How has this all happned 
because of you? I gave you somuch tension and 
because of me you met an accident. I want to live near you. Ramsha, don’t hold yourself 
responsible, nothing has happened to me, 
I am absolutely fine. Everything will be like before
in a few days. You are the one who says, there is always God’s expedience 
in everything. So then there must be expedience
of God that I am here. Don’t push me away from you, Afnan, let me stay near you, 
please Afnan. Okay why are you crying. 
Afnan, careful. it’s nothing, nothing, nothing. Afnan, careful, what are you doing? 
Why are you crying? I am saying everything is fine, I am absolutely fine, 
this is a minor injury, doctor has just made me wear this 
for no reason. You must go, it won’t be good 
if someone sees you here right now. I won’t go anywhere from here, I will stay with you and 
take care of you, and by the way I am your wife, I have right on you, you can’t take away my right from me,
 Afnan, don’t ask me to go away from you, 
I won’t go anywhere. Okay, I am not taking 
any right away from you. I promised you, I will get you your honor and
I will do that anyhow. I won’t break my promise. Just stay strong for a few days, everything will be fine, 
stop crying, you know I cannot tolerate you crying. You made the soup yourself? Yes. it must be very bad. Afnan. Try it. Shall I feed you? Not bad. All your prayers get answered right? So I was thinking if you can 
pray for me too? Whenever I pray 
I always pray for you. Yes but there is one prayer that 
I especially want you to make. What? That May God take away 
all my difficulties. Always keep our companionship intact and remove all the problems. Stay here today. Ramsha I cannot stay today. Alizey’s condition is not well. I cannot leave her alone 
in this condition. If things were normal I would have 
stayed but… But what? But I want Alizey to stay happy till 
our child comes in this world. No problem Afnan, I guess it was in our fate 
to meet like this.
