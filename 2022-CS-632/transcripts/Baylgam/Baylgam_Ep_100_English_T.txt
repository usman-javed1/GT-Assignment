[20.76] Alizeh?
[22.08] Alizeh? Please,
what are you doing, dude?
[24.20] I am already very worried, Alizeh,
for God’s sake don’t do this else I will get mad.
[28.84] you have made me mad, Afnan.
[37.72] You brought that girl here first,
[39.80] had an affair with her, married her
[48.96] and now you want to keep her
here again on my head.
[59.28] What do you think Afnan,
[60.92] I will quietly watch the show here?
[63.04] Not at all!
[69.92] I am not a disgusting illiterate girl
like Ramsha,
[83.00] I know my rights.
[90.84] I am not dependent on you… you..
[92.80] Alizeh, please, please
you can’t do this, Alizeh.
[99.24] I cannot let you go like this Alizeh,
[107.08] especially not in this condition at all,
you are my responsibility.
[116.04] Just think
[117.72] how will you even go out
in this condition?
[123.92] If not about me or yourself,
at least think about our baby,
[126.80] how will he get affected.
[128.04] Did you think about our baby when
you were doing a second marriage?
[135.80] So then why should I think?
[144.28] You can be a father and
still be this selfish
[146.24] then why can’t I be selfish
being a mother, Afnan?
[150.04] Okay so that means
you won’t listen to me?
[160.40] So, then I am helpless,
I will have to go talk to Aunt
[162.64] and involve her in all this,
you will get controlled by her.
[165.12] Af…
[165.92] Aunt?
Afnan, stop.
[173.00] Aunt, I have no other way except
bringing Ramsha into this house.
[181.76] I know
[184.28] I got married by my choice,
[196.84] this is very wrong with Alizeh
[208.28] but Aunt,
[211.88] I am the only person who has been
the most affected by all this.
[229.96] If Alizeh can forgive me,
[234.72] there should be no other reason
except my health.
[252.32] My health is deteriorating
day by day,
[264.92] I am unable to focus on business,
[274.00] the whole business is suffering loss.
[286.20] I don’t understand what should I do.
[302.00] Sometimes I think,
if dad was alive today,
[308.60] I wouldn’t have been in
so much trouble,
[321.32] he might have done something
to bring peace in my life.
[338.00] But I beg you, Aunt,
[347.64] you are the elder in this house,
[352.12] make Alizeh understand
[362.32] else we can suffer damage
that will never be repaired.
[376.24] It will be better for all of us.
[420.12] Alizeh,
[422.72] Afnan is not wrong,
[426.72] look what had to happen, it did,
[429.36] I have never seen Afnan this worried.
[439.12] Try to understand Afnan,
[442.36] look God forbid, if something 
happens to Afnan,
[447.28] you will regret a lot.
[451.88] Mom, but what have I done 
wrong in all this?
[455.96] My love when am I saying 
that you are wrong?
[463.72] I am just trying to tell you that
[467.36] what had to happen,
has happened
[469.96] now you should support Afnan,
[478.60] and then Afnan is my only nephew
[482.12] the last symbol of my brother,
[490.32] if something happens to Afnan,
[494.20] I will never forgive you.
[506.16] My good daughter,
[512.24] prove to be a good wife.
[528.48] you have done wrong 
with my daughter.
[533.16] I don’t get it myself that 
what is happening with me.
[541.28] the ground is feeling 
insufficient to me.
[548.96] Since Dad has left,
[552.76] all the happiness and ease have
 gone away from my life.
[562.32] It feels like I have just gotten alone.
[750.24] Look her blood pressure 
is very high,
[753.56] I am prescribing some medicines
 for her for now,
[755.56] just give her regularly and 
we will recheck after a week.
[758.80] Okay fine.
[764.08] take this.
[766.56] Okay Doctor. 
Thank you.
[785.32] How is she feeling now?
[788.36] Her BP is a little high
[800.28] but she will be fine if God wills.
[802.68] It is normal in such condition.
[817.36] You guys sit.
[871.88] I know you are upset with me,
[883.84] and I even know the reason behind it.
[897.96] How can a woman tolerate
[902.56] her husband’s second wife 
to come live in her home.
[917.28] But Alizeh,
[922.24] to be honest, I am helpless.
[946.52] I am the reason you have become 
helpless, Afnan,
[959.00] because of this child you are helpless 
to keep me with you.
[963.48] No, it’s not that,
[972.16] I said all of this out of anger
[976.20] and I am really sorry for that.
[991.32] It is true
[1000.72] that because of our child,
[1002.88] your importance has increased 
in my eyes
[1015.96] but it is not true that only because 
of this child I want to live with you.
[1029.12] You are my wife Alizeh,
[1040.80] and our marriage was my love marriage.
[1056.84] I have loved you a lot
[1069.20] and before becoming my wife 
you were also my friend,
[1081.48] I used to share all my feelings
 with you.
[1095.12] Even today,
[1097.68] I am doing the same even today, Alizeh.
[1110.48] Alizeh, you have so many 
relationships with me
[1112.60] that no one can break them 
even if they want to,
[1124.88] I know because of me,
[1127.40] there have been problems 
in our relationship,
[1136.48] trust me Alizeh,
[1141.16] I am helpless because of my heart.
[1154.36] I can only request you
[1159.68] to understand my problem and
[1164.28] support me.
[1299.84] Ramsha,
[1302.56] I have asked Jamshed to bring 
all your stuff here
[1306.60] but let me know if there is anything left,
I will get it.
[1312.32] Yes, there is something left.
[1319.04] Really?
[1322.84] What is left?
[1327.96] Your love.
[1352.16] The love for which you took me 
to that house,
[1369.36] I want that love and respect 
from you Afnan
[1372.84] that you promised to give me for life.
[1409.44] Umm,
[1412.48] I...
[1416.16] I am going out with Alizeh.
[1428.72] You can have food, 
I will have it outside.
[1469.12] Why have you kept these 
Wedding pictures with you?
[1471.88] Because it is our pictures…
[1473.32] So?
[1476.48] What do you want?
[1478.80] Do you want to use them 
against me as well?
[1481.44] You have kept them so 
you can blackmail me,
[1484.60] like you got our shopping video viral,
[1487.00] you will do the same with Wedding 
pictures too, right?
[1489.60] Why would I do that?
[1490.92] Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife.
[1496.08] You got our video viral so people can 
get to know about us,
[1500.48] and now you will get these Wedding 
pictures viral
[1502.84] so everyone can know 
we are married,
[1507.48] but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once,
[1511.20] what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha?
[1527.84] I have always gotten ditched 
by trusting you.
[1532.80] Why are you doing this, Afnan?
[1534.60] I don’t trust you anymore, Ramsha,
[1544.64] not at all,
[1546.24] and where there is no trust, 
there is nothing at all.
[1572.84] Whatever has already happened, 
nothing more than that can happen now.
[1577.80] The only sad part is that
[1581.16] our marriage is not taking place 
because of our love
[1588.60] but because of that ugly stain,
[1592.68] you put on my character,
[1600.56] I have to fulfill this relationship 
because of that today.
[1605.08] Afnan, why don’t you understand that 
whatever has happened is not my fault?
[1608.48] Whatever happened shouldn’t 
have happened
[1612.16] but from now you are my honor,
[1617.64] and try to not compromise 
my respect at least this time.
[1651.60] Afnan?
[1661.92] Afnan, come quickly.
[1685.08] Yes, come let’s go.
[1687.44] How do I look?
[1689.88] You look very nice.
[1697.64] Does this color suit me?
[1700.32] Yes, it suits you a lot.
[1711.44] Actually Afnan, we are going out 
together after so long
[1714.84] so I thought of wearing something
 you would like.
[1719.84] That is what you have always done,
[1722.48] you have always cared about 
what I like and dislike.
[1734.44] You are a very good wife.
[1746.36] Shall we leave, 
aren’t you getting late now?
[1748.28] Let’s go. 
Let’s go.
[1775.48] shall I open it.
[1776.60] No, you have to keep your eyes closed.
[1780.24] What are you doing?
 May I open them now?
[1782.60] No.
[1783.88] What are you doing Afnan?
May I open my eyes? What?
[1787.24] Open them now.
[1791.76] How do you like it?
[1795.40] What was the need for it, Afnan?
[1797.28] Why wasn’t it needed?
[1799.00] Your mood got so off 
because of me today,
[1801.72] I thought I should get you a gift 
to make it up to you.
[1807.36] I know you love me a lot 
but I am absolutely fine,
[1811.00] nothing has happened to me,
it is just a matter of few days,
[1814.44] everything will get back to normal 
that is why,
[1816.84] you must go from here.
[1818.20] No, no, no, I won’t go anywhere 
from here, Afnan,
[1821.08] I can’t leave you and 
go anywhere,
[1823.12] I will stay close to you and 
take care of you
[1825.52] and all this has happened because
of me anyway, Afnan.
[1828.32] How has this all happened 
because of you?
[1830.20] I gave you so much tension
[1833.44] and because of me 
you met an accident.
[1836.00] I want to live near you.
[1837.92] Ramsha, don’t hold yourself 
responsible,
[1840.16] nothing has happened to me, 
I am absolutely fine.
[1843.80] Everything will be like before 
in a few days.
[1850.40] You are the one who says,
[1852.28] there is always God’s expedience 
in everything.
[1876.08] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[1878.40] It was so much fun after so long, today,
[1880.76] we went for an outing after so long.
[1883.72] Did you like it?
[1885.88] Hmm. ,
[1886.96] I have my doctor’s appointment tomorrow,
will you come along?
[1891.20] Do one thing, get an appointment and 
let me know I will come from the office.
[1895.60] Okay I will do that.
[1898.00] Umm Alizeh, you must go
and rest now,
[1907.68] I will come in a while.
[1910.80] Why?
[1912.72] Where are you going?
[1923.60] To Ramsha?
[1927.36] Yes, Alizeh,
[1935.76] I have to look after her as well.
