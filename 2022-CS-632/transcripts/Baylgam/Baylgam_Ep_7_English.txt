Ramsha, the thing is that you have gotten a proposal. Dad, I am sick of this aunt matchmaking. That aunt matchmaking hasn’t brought
 this proposal, in fact, your aunt has sent it. Aunt? Mom, tell you aunt that if she is really
 interested in matchmaking then she must go get Annie married, 
why is everyone after me? What nonsense Ramsha? At least ask whose proposal has 
she brought. Yes, actually your aunt has asked for 
your proposal for Shani. What? Shani and I? What is wrong with you guys? Yes, my child, he is a nice guy, plus he is family… What are you saying dad? How can I marry Shani? I have never thought like this about him. If you haven’t then do it now, he is family he has grown up
 in front of us. Listen? Think thoroughly and answer us. Yes, yes, think properly okay and then respond, it’s okay. Kids these days have a lot of attitude. That’s it, that’s it. Shall I give you something else? 
No I will just take salad, nothing else. Uncle, your appetite is decreasing 
day by day, you will get weak like this. My child, for now, 
my gut has become weak, there is an age factor too, if I eat more it gets difficult to digest. Brother, by the way, Alizey is right, if you will eat less you will become weak. Afsheen, my friend, Mr Jamil Malik, may God forgive him, he used to say that after 50 and 60, a man doesn’t eat food,
 food eats the man. So people get ill by eating more, 
no one gets ill by eating less. uncle is right. Alizey, please pass me the chicken. Alizey? Please pass me the chicken. Mom please pass the chicken to Afnan. Thank you aunt, so kind of you. Afsheen then did you talk to children? It’s good that you spoke about it, brother, both of them are home 
so let’s talk right now, you know sometimes Afnan is not home 
and others she is not home. Hmm, let’s ask then. What dates should we decide then, 
my child, Alizey? umm, uncle I don’t know and I don’t want to get married right now. Hey, what is wrong? 
But I want to get married, I don’t want to stay a bachelor. 
Let’s do one thing, let’s keep it on some weekend of the same month,
what say Alizey? Okay then marry whoever you want to 
but I don’t want to. Alizey? 
Alizey? Alizey, listen to me. What happened to Alizey? Nothing dad, you know she is a bit… She is just in a bad mood,
 I will fix it right now, just wait I am bringing him 
in two minutes. What is going on? What is wrong 
with both of them? I don’t know brother I think they had a fight 
over something again. I don’t know. It’s okay she will be fine. 
She is our daughter. Look at this dad, this is the final draft of the project 
I want to start. Have a look and ell what do you want 
to say about it? Yes, it’s fine, you must start it. Dad, I have done a profit and 
loss analysis for it and according to that we will at least 
get 30% profit by it. Hmm. It’s a huge project, I think 
you would need extra labor. no dad, I don’t need extra labor, the man power we have is very efficient. What we have to do is that not much, we will just have to make them work 
2 to 3 hours overtime, our project will be done and 
at the end of the day they will be at benefit too, 
their salaries will be increased and our work will be done as well. Okay fine, you talk to them and announce bonus 
for the labor as well. Dad, we give them annual bonus already if we start giving them bonuses 
every other month the profit margin will decrease. You keep on asking for virtue and 
success from God and then you get scared of spending 
from the money that he gives you? Be scared of the day, be scared of the day when he stops 
his virtue on us. Afnan? Yes dad, as you wish. Uncle, have you sent the driver outside? Yes, my child, he has gone with Afsheen, she wanted to get some things, why? 
You want to go somewhere? Yes, I wanted to go to a friend’s place, it’s okay I will get it from outside. No, no, why? Afnan is here, he will drop you, go Afnan, drop Alizey. It’s okay uncle, I will manage on my own. I feel like choking you to death right now. What sort of a friend are you? 
Couldn’t you tell me? I was about to tell you but when do you listen to 
anyone except yourself? remember I was about to say it 
the other day… So you should have talked clearly, why were you walking around 
in circles and talking? You could have clearly said that 
I have gotten a proposal for your brother. I was about to say it when mom came. I am so mad at your mom right now. How can she even think like this? That I and Shani, it even feels weird hearing about us. Imagine, look at me and 
then look at Shani. Now don’t even say that my brother is not as bad as you are saying. You like someone else is a different story. You know that right? You know I like someone else so why didn’t you tell your mom? How can I tell this to mom? So then you could have told your brother, you could have told anyone. We will get in trouble if I told brother. I feel like choking your brother to death. God forbid, may God give a long life 
to my brother. So then ask him to do things 
that would keep him alive, if he will do all this, I will kill him, I am telling you. You are very dangerous. That is what I am trying to 
make you understand, so go and tell this to your brother that it will be better for him to stay 
as far away from me as possible. I don’t understand that mom dad uncle and aunt 
everyone knows my nature but still how did they think 
that I and Shani? No no no, this is not possible. I will have to talk to mom, 
I will have to talk to mom. Why are you standing here?
Go away. Get lost. What have I done? Okay. I will have to talk to mom, how is it possible? 
How can I marry Shani? Relax, Ramsha, relax, I have to do something. Alizey? Alizey, listen to me. Alizey, listen to me, what is wrong?
At least listen to me. What is your problem Afnan? I have asked you not to talk to me. Okay fine, just think that do you even know 
how you behaved in front of dad? I Know it very well how 
I behaved in front of him, okay then do one thing, think and
 then let me think to because if you do this 
I will marry someone else. So then go and marry someone else 
by all means. I don’t care. You do care. I know it very well, you are just angry that is why 
you are saying all this else you love me a lot. Oh you are mistaken, I hate you. But I love you and do you know that if I had said this to any other girl she would have become crazy, 
crazyyy, hmm. So then go and confess your love
 to someone else. Why are you wasting my time? Alizey? Alizey, talk to me. Oh God you get mad over every little thing, I know that you are actually not mad, you deformed my nose. Phone. Let me call Afnan. Hello? Hello? What happened? 
Who was it? That you will tell me whose call was it? Who was it? Yeah, probably Afnan’s sister 
picked up the call. Anyway, it’s fine I will try in a while. This… Look, the number is not even saved,
 how would I know whose call is it? Is it the same girl I saw with you? Who might get crazy our of happiness
 after hearing the confession of your love. What? What are you saying? How is it possible? 
It must be a wrong number. Why are you talking like that? I am telling the number is not saved 
but still. Pointless fights and quarrels. Mom? I am here. 
Mom listen to me. What happened? Aunt? 
Hmm? Uncle is calling you outside. Your uncle came so early? Yes. I didn’t realize. mom. Tell me what is it? Mom, eave this and listen to me. 
What happened? Umm, I don’t want to marry Shani. What do you mean by you 
don’t want to marry? What is wrong with Shani? What’s good in Shani? Have you ever looked at him carefully? He looks so strange and then
 he dresses up so weirdly and take the same face to the shop. He is such nice, pious and talented boy. Oh please mom, I said I don’t want to marry him 
so I just don’t want to and he doesn’t have anything anyway, he doesn’t have a house, a car 
or a business and he is not even educated. I know he is not educated, he was never interested in studying 
since childhood but look at him now, he takes care of the business better than
 your dad and uncle. Mom, I am telling you that 
I don’t want to marry him so I don’t want to, go and refuse aunt right now, 
go please. Ramsha, go away and let me work. Mom, please. I am asking you to leave 
and let me work. Okay, okay then let dad come today, I will talk to him myself, I will tell him that I don’t want 
to marry Shani. Ramsha? Ramsha? Where is uncle? How would I know where he is? Hey? What is wrong with her? 
Why is her mood so off? Salma just let her be? Check the curry. What happened? What is going on between you and Afnan? Nothing has happened mom. Alizey, I am not blind. Alizey, he is constantly after you 
trying to make it upto you, but why are you so mad that 
you are not ready to fix things? mom, you are so concerned about Afnan? Yes I am concerned and 
You should be too. Can’t you see how he is so careful
 about you? He takes care of you so much. Let it be mom, you don’t know Afnan. That is what I want to know what is it?
That I don’t know. What is the quarrel that is not ending,
 Alizey? My child, if you disliked something 
Afnan did so then forgive him. Good and bad things happen 
between everyone, and now you guys are about to get 
in to this new relationship. If you will fight like this with each other, how will things work? Mom, I have a bad headache I am going to my room to rest for a while. Think calmly about what I have said. After all why don’t you understand that we cannot refuse this proposal. This proposal hasn’t come from outside
 but within home, we would have refused long time back 
if it was from somewhere else but your uncle and aunt has given proposal
for you and if your dad refuses him then… Then? It wouldn’t be much of a deal then, the worst that can happen is that uncle 
and aunt will get upset and then the things will fix 
at home in few days. What do you want? You want me to sacrifice myself 
so they don’t get upset? After all what is your problem? See, you now think all the flaws in him are good 
traits and you like listening to it. Shut up Ramsha. Ramsha, my child, 
keep one thing in mind, look this is a proposal from our home, 
Shani is our own kid, I even like him and most of all you will stay 
in front of our eyes. Dad, its better for me to stay happy 
rather than stay in front of your eyes. And I can never be happy 
in life with this Shani. Did you see what she is saying? It is all because of our over 
pampering and love. We have spoiled her. I will tell you to go right now and accept 
Salma and Anwar’s proposal. You must just go. 
Mom, you are talking like my enemy. Ramsha, aren’t you ashamed of calling 
your mother your enemy? yes, so you are talking like enemies too. Dad, I beg you, I beg you to please refuse this proposal. 
Please dad, please. My child, why are you doing this? 
What is wrong with you? Dad, since childhood till now even every toy 
that I have gotten is by my own choice, so then such huge decision of marriage, I beg you please refuse this proposal, you cannot do me so wrong. Please dad. This girl is too much, oh God forgive me. Okay fine, go and let me think 
what I have to do. You will still think about this? Okay then fine, even I am sitting here and I won’t move till 
you refuse this proposal. okay my child, I am not marrying you to Shani. Really? Dad, you are so good. 
Thank you so much, thank you dad. 
Thank you so much. I am not one of those dads who sacrifice their daughters 
to save their relationships. Your happiness is more important to me
 than anything in this world. Hello? Yes Afnan I have been waiting for your call 
for so long, do you know? How many times have I told you not to keep on calling 
if I don’t receive once, why don’t you understand this little thing? And I have especially asked you 
not to call at this time, I am at my home, I am with my family. What is wrong with you Afnan? I was just calling because I was worried, I want to tell you something important. You have never-ending worries. Afnan? Okay fine, call me when you are free, 
I will wait, I need to talk to you about 
something important. Okay I will call myself and will even 
listen to your problem but you will not call me again now. Okay fine, bye. He is always busy. what problem have I taken on myself? So? Are you done with the calculation or
you are just inking the pages? Dad, I have written down the amount 
for the supply that we got in the morning, and have mentioned the cost 
of cold drink, let me know if anything is left. Look Shani, brother met the wholesaler so ask him about all the calculations. I will talk to uncle. Okay. Dad, my fees need to be paid 
this week as well. No problem, you just tell me a day or two before, I will pay my daughter’s fee. Okay Thank you. Tea. 
Yes. Annie, go and look after the kitchen 
if you are done studying, clean it, it is all messed up, 
I get tired of working all day. Mom, that is why I am saying 
to get a daughter in law so she helps you with work. Ramsha doesn’t even touch 
any work right now I don’t know if she will work 
after marriage or not. Mom, Ramsha does work. You don’t need to defend her, has anyone asked you anything? 
Sit quietly. Did you get any response from aunt? Yes, I was about to ask the same. Did brother respond? No, there is no response, in fact, 
they didn’t talk about it at all. Okay, so then what do you think? Will brother agree? My Shani is one in a million, 
he is a mannerful kid, and he is so hardworking and talented, he doesn’t even have the bad company
 of friends. They won’t even get such a son-in-law
 if the try to find. Mom, brother and Ramsha’s couple 
isn’t a little mismatch? Hey why? I mean, they are both stubborn. There is nothing like that and girls fix themselves after marriage, she is a very nice girl, she is just spoiled by the love of parents, 
otherwise, she is absolutely fine. But still, Ramsha will never… Who has asked you to sit here and 
talk about this marriage? Go and clean the kitchen, I have told you,
you don’t listen, come on, get up. Okay. Mom, talk to them again. Yes, I want the same that you must talk once more 
to sister in law. I will talk. What happened? 
You didn’t sleep yet? nothing I wasn’t just sleepy. I Know you are worried 
because of Ramsha. I don’t understand how to refuse Anwar. He is my brother, he has asked Ramsha’s proposal 
with so much pride in me. Would you agree if I say 
something to you? Say it? Don’t refuse Anwar, say yes to him. What are you saying? Despite knowing that Ramsha is not ready 
for this marriage? I know it, I know it. She is a kid, she is still very childish and she doesn’t know 
what’s good and bad, if you look at Annie you will realize 
how she is so mature in this age. I think that if I had a son, would have made Annie my daughter in law. You are right, Ramsha is immature but I cannot take her life decision 
without her choice. I cannot see tears in her eyes and 
you know that very well. Sajid, I am her mother and I know her very well, you will see when she gets married, she will forget everything, she will be happy. And Salma was telling me that Shani has shown interest in marrying 
Ramsha himself, Ramsha is Shani’s choice. Just let them get married once and 
everything will be fine and you will get a son and son in law 
in the shape of your nephew. And the fear we have after marrying 
our daughter away, that fear will be gone too. This house, this business everything
 will stay in home only. Life will become easy. Let’s see what we can do. I didn’t realize and its Fajr time. Alizey? What happened my child 
you didn’t go to office today are you feeling well? Say something? Look I am getting tensed like this, what is it my love? Yes mom I am fine. I ask so much, you don’t tell anything, Afnan doesn’t 
tell anything either. What is it? Did Afnan say something? 
Did you guys have a fight? You just consider my tears 
to be pointless. Okay fine, I understand but now until when will you lock yourself 
in the room like this? Get up change and come out of here. Yes mom, you go, 
I am changing and coming, get coffee made for me. Okay I will get it made. Hurry up, okay? Why didn’t you have breakfast with everyone. I didn’t feel like it. Just get me tea, I want to have tea. If you allow, may I talk to Salma? No, I will talk to Anwar myself at Shop. okay as you wish, but please think and talk. Yes Mehnaz even I am scared that there might be problem 
between me and Anwar. This girl has put us through such a trial. I am very angry at Ramsha. There is no need to say anything 
to Ramsha. And don’t get angry at her for no reason, it is her right to marry or not marry anyone. I don’t understand how will I talk to Slama
 how will I face her. Don’t worry about Salma, 
I will talk to Anwar he will talk to her. don’t worry and get me tea. okay. Greetings. Greetings. Where did you go brother? no no everything is fine, your sister in law stopped me to talk
 about something important. Brother, even I wanted to talk to you 
about something important, I don’t get a chance at home to talk to you. Slama was asking what is your decision 
about Ramsha and Shani’s marriage? What happened brother? 
Why are you quiet? Where is Shani? He has gone to the warehouse, 
for stock… look Anwar, you are my brother, you are the closest to my heart and Shani is not my nephew, 
I have always considered him like my son. Brother, no matter if you say something or not, I know what is in your heart, I know, I have given you the status of a father 
after dad left, I have always asked for you and now in this important decision of life, I have asked for your help. All that is absolutely fine, Shani is a very nice boy too… So that means you are agreeing to Shani 
and Ramsha’s marriage? Hey? Hey shani? Come here, congratulations, uncle has accepted your 
marriage proposal. listen to me, at least. I was already, look, 
look at this marriage, I had already bought sweets, 
Have sweets. Hey, feed sweets to uncle. 
At least listen to me. And uncle really concerned for his daughter,
keep her safely. Congratulations. 
Congratulations. You have it too dad. 
Yes. you should have it too. 
Congratulations. You kept my pride, I was sure you will never say no to me. you eased my difficulty, I can’t tell you how happy I am. Go get water. Get water. Hurry up. Will you have more?
No. Greetings. Greetings. What happened? 
Why do you look so upset? I am just coming back from Alizey’s room, she hasn’t even gone to office today, I don’t know why has she locked herself 
in the room. I don’t understand what is wrong with her. Okay don’t worry, I will talk to her. I am going to make coffee for Alizey, I came out because I saw you. Shall I make it for you as well?
No. I will make it myself in fact, I will make myself for Alizey too, 
my hard work might pay off. You have just come back from work,
you are tired. My beloved aunt, 
why do you worry? I know it very well, whenever Alizey gets upset with me, she gets fixed in a snap when 
she drinks the coffee that I make. Okay, come. 
Let’s go. Sister in law? Sister in law? 
Hey Salma? Sister in law you are here? 
I looked for you in the entire house. hey? Have sweets, have sweets. 
Just have it. I wanted to have this sweet 
by you though, but I got so emotional out of happiness
 that I can’t even tell you. Thank god, god gave us the opportunity 
to witness this happiness. Wow, you are all eating sweets alone 
and no one even asked me? No, my child, here this is for you, infact, keep the whole packet, you have the most right on it. Wow, it’s a very delicious sweet, its very tasty. Greetings dad,
have sweets. No I had it at the shop. 
Greetings brother. Greetings. Wow, so the sweets are being 
distributed at the shop as well? but what for? I also don’t understand that 
why is Salma feeding sweets? Anyway, none of our business, may God give them thousands of 
such happiness so we get thousands of sweets like these. Amen, is everything okay you look so worried, 
what happened? you didn’t understand it even after 
having sweets? What? What did I not understand? I said something to Anwar and 
he took it wrong. if he wasn’t able to understand 
then you should have told them that Ramsha is not ready for this marriage. Why did you stay quiet? 
You should have said. He is my brother I couldn’t have clearly refused. I was talking indirectly and 
he took it wrong. You have no idea what you have done. Don’t worry let me do something. Alizey? I have made piping hot coffee. I swear you will enjoy 
after having this coffee. I don’t want to have coffee. Please leave. What is wrong with you, Alizey? Why are you talking so rudely to me. I have made coffee with so much love
 for you and you know it very well that I cannot tolerate your rudeness 
and when you are upset, it ruins my day and night, 
I am unable to work, that is why I came early from work
so I can talk to you. So what? You haven’t done any favor on me
by coming early from office, I didn’t ask you to come early from work. Alizey, what is wrong with you? You are that upset? Look at me. Why are you making a big deal 
out of such a small issue? Listen, I cannot tolerate this behavior 
from you. I have been restless all night, 
I couldn’t even sleep because of you. You must not be able to sleep 
because you were missing someone. What? I am so sorry not at you but myself, in fact I feel sorry on my love for you 
that I cannot prove you how sincere I am with you, I cannot affect you that my love for you… 
Afnan, who was that girl?
