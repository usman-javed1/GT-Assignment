[44.24] There is no order to get a girl 
married without her will.
[49.44] You are just like my daughter.
[52.00] Just like I will ask my daughter for her will,
I will also ask you.
[56.32] What is the matter? 
Tell me, what is the issue?
[71.00] Now I will have to trust someone
 in your matter,
[74.76] then why not Shani? He is family.
[77.60] Look child,
[79.60] forget whatever happened.
[82.52] If you marry Shani,
[85.72] you will stay here in front of my eyes.
[89.48] Shani’s proposal coming after whatever
happened is a big blessing, child.
[144.84] What have you done, Alizeh?
[147.80] You went and returned the ring.
[151.12] Afnan told me you broke the engagement 
and came back.
[153.96] He was absolutely right,
[155.68] and I should have done this 
a long time back.
[159.44] What is this?
[161.24] Are you people children that
 you fight on small things.
[165.00] And who breaks the engagement 
in the fight?
[166.56] Mama, I didn’t start fighting. 
Afnan started fighting.
[169.60] He has no manners to talk,
[171.44] he started screaming at me
as soon as I came.
[174.08] I am not his maid.
[176.12] I don’t know what he thinks of himself.
[177.88] He is insulting me in front of the servants.
[180.56] I will not marry such a person.
[182.80] Whatever it was, you shouldn’t have
 broken the engagement.
[186.04] Here, I am preparing for your marriage
with Afnan
[189.00] and you went and 
broke the engagement.
[191.44] If you had any issue with Afnan, 
yo should have spoken to me.
[194.84] Stupid girl.
[196.72] I don’t want to marry him.
[209.20] What?
[210.64] Are you speaking the truth?
[212.72] Madam Ramsha, 
I am saying the right thing.
[215.08] Last night, sir Afnan and 
madam Alizeh fought a lot.
[218.52] Rasheeda was saying that 
madam Alizeh broke the engagement
[222.32] and she even returned the ring.
[224.80] Mr. Afnan is really angry.
[226.76] Elder sir and elder madam 
are really worried.
[230.96] Let’s see what happens now.
Let’s see what happens next.
[253.24] Brother, I have tried talking to Alizeh,
[256.68] but she is not listening to me.
[259.44] I feel that we should give 
both of them some time.
[263.48] Yes, so that they fight more,
[266.04] and the thing that is in the home right now,
 should first reach the neighbours
[268.76] and then it reaches the relatives.
[270.28] Do you want that 
what the servants saw today,
[272.72] the relatives also see it?
[273.96] They don’t understand 
the delicacy of the matter.
[276.52] Brother, right now there is not just 
a need to make Alizeh understand,
[279.80] but we also need to make 
Afnan understand.
[285.32] I mean,
[288.04] you know the young generation of today.
[291.00] Have they ever accepted 
their mistake till now?
[293.72] Afsheen, if Alizeh had an issue with Afnan,
[297.00] then she should have spoken to me or you.
[299.92] They can break relations like this themselves?
[301.72] This means, the children have grown up so big
[303.56] that they will break a relation when they want, 
they will form a relation when they want.
[305.92] Meaning, what the elders say has 
no importance in their eyes.
[309.20] You are absolutely right brother,
[311.36] I have scolded Alizeh.
[313.72] Give me some time, 
I will talk to her,
[317.28] because right now she is not willing 
to listen to me.
[320.76] Well done.
[322.92] When she is not ready to hear 
anything from you,
[326.04] then what will she understand?
[329.20] The children have made a joke 
out of relations,
[331.44] this is the limit.
[365.84] Greetings.
[368.40] Greetings.
[371.40] Dad, you are still awake?
[373.20] Afnan, I have been seeing 
for the past few days
[375.36] you have been coming home late.
[377.40] Now don’t say that there is a lot of 
work load in the office.
[380.80] I spoke to the guard and 
also the security officer.
[384.60] When the office is empty and closed, 
you still sit there for long hours for no reason.
[391.16] Did you talk to Alizeh?
[398.68] There is no point talking to her dad.
[403.52] She is not ready to hear anything,
[406.92] nor is she ready to understand anything.
[413.88] Goodnight.
[436.16] Greetings.
[437.04] Greetings.
[439.20] Dad, did you call me?
[441.16] Yes, Afnan,
[444.12] I wanted to talk to you about 
something important.
[445.92] Dad, I have a really important meeting 
with Mr. Ahmad,
[449.04] I am already late. If you want,
[451.16] we can talk comfortably at night.
[453.36] Sit. Sit here.
[458.12] Comfortably.
[461.20] Look, I am really worried for the child, 
Ramsha.
[469.00] I was thinking about her and see,
[472.04] I feel I am the reason for her
 being alone is me.
[481.16] I have seen that child, she has stayed here
for so many days,
[484.32] she is really sensitive.
[487.32] Dad
[490.36] was the important thing you wanted 
to discuss?
[492.80] Sorry, I am getting late for the meeting…
[494.56] I am not done yet, Afnan.
[500.64] Look,
[504.88] I have thought a lot about 
Ramsha last night,
[510.84] and my heart wants to do something for her.
Something,
[516.92] that can give comfort to my heart,
so that I can be satisfied.
[522.84] So,
[526.52] you marry Ramsha?
[557.28] Dad,
[559.20] just cause Alizeh has said no 
to marrying me,
[566.36] does this mean, 
I will marry any girl?
[569.64] No, dad, no.
[577.80] Are you even thinking 
what you are saying?
[580.60] What do you know about that girl?
[583.32] Who is she?
[584.52] What family has she come from?
[586.12] Is she speaking the truth or 
if she is lying. There is nothing
[588.20] and you asking your only son 
to marry her?
[601.92] You want to do something for her, 
right, dad?
[604.88] Then give her some money
[608.04] or give her a suitable place to stay, 
but forget about me getting married.
[612.56] Please.
[621.44] You are right, Afnan, I don’t know her.
[625.28] But all the days she has stayed her, son,
[627.68] I saw no flaw or bad habit in her.
[629.28] Just because you didn’t see a bad habit or 
flaw in her, then it doesn’t mean she has no flaw.
[633.80] You don’t know her.
[643.80] Do you know her from earlier?
[656.88] Speak up.
[661.16] No dad.
[663.44] I don’t know her and neither 
do I want to know her.
[668.68] She is not worthy of me.
[675.24] I will just say this to you that
[678.64] forget the thought of this from your heart, 
it would be better.
[686.72] I will not marry her under 
any circumstances.
[697.72] I will talk to Alizeh.
[699.84] I will make her understand, 
I will convince her.
[701.64] Even if she still doesn’t get convince, 
still…
[704.20] still I will not marry Ramsha.
[708.48] Goodbye.
[710.24] Goodbye.
[721.08] I am sorry, dad.
[725.04] I know you must not like it.
[730.84] I have always listened to you.
[735.16] But this time I cannot agree to this.
[741.40] Goodbye.
[774.96] I got so defamed because of 
that action of yours.
[779.28] My father couldn’t tolerate this, 
he just couldn’t.
[783.28] that shock took away my father.
[786.36] Whatever happened with my mother 
is all in front of you Afnan.
[792.40] I have lost everything 
in my love for you,
[799.48] and what did you lose?
[802.76] Nothing.
[804.80] Nothing, Afnan.
[816.80] What is wrong with you?
[818.20] What tone are you using with me?
[819.92] No matter what tone 
I am using with you,
[822.08] why are you not answering 
a question for me?
[824.32] When I had told you not to go to 
Salman’s birthday, then why did you go?
[827.96] Why are you constantly saying the same thing,
that you had said no.
[830.96] so what if I went? What do I do now?
[833.08] And tell me right now,
[834.64] do you want to do this 
after marriage too?
[836.40] Yes, this is what I have to do, 
and this is what I want to do.
[839.08] And you will have to listen to me. 
You can do what you want.
[842.40] Yes, so fine,
[845.28] you want a slave and not a wife,
[847.16] and I cannot be a slave. 
Keep your ring with yourself.
[855.20] Look, I am really worried for the child, 
Ramsha.
[861.04] I was thinking about her and see,
[863.92] I feel I am the reason for her 
being alone is me.
[873.04] I have seen that child, she has 
stayed here for so many days,
[876.60] she is really sensitive.
[881.44] My heart wants to do 
something for her.
[885.72] Something, that can give comfort
 to my heart,
[890.40] so that I can be satisfied.
[893.36] So,
[897.12] you marry Ramsha?
[915.20] Sir, Mr. Ahmad is here.
[947.80] Sir, are you going somewhere?
[949.84] What do I say to Mr. Ahmad 
about the meeting?
[953.00] Tell him the meeting will be rescheduled.
[955.24] I will tell him when it will happen.
[957.44] Okay.
[987.44] Why did you come here, Afnan?
[990.80] To meet you, to talk to you.
[993.00] Come on, sit in the car, we will talk.
[994.92] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything.
[996.72] This is my office, 
I come here to work.
[999.16] You go home.
[1000.44] Fine, you don’t listen to me, 
I wont listen to you.
[1003.72] I too will stand here
[1005.64] and I will not let you go inside. 
You do your work.
[1008.92] Afnan, please don’t create a scene here.
[1010.96] Alizeh, I am not creating a scene, 
you are.
[1014.88] I am just standing here. 
You want that I create a scene?
[1017.48] Hey, greetings.
[1020.12] Sit in the car.
[1035.96] Hmm.
[1045.12] Sorry, Alizeh.
[1048.36] It is okay.
[1051.40] But Afnan, have you not started to get
a little too short tempered nowadays?
[1054.36] What is wrong with you?
[1056.00] What do I tell you?
[1059.24] I am going through a bad time.
[1062.84] I shouldn’t have gotten upset with you
and I didn’t want to get upset,
[1067.24] but, you know, I do what 
I don’t want to do nowadays.
[1073.88] Okay, I am your cousin, 
I understand all this.
[1078.12] Why were you screaming at Ramsha?
[1080.72] I feel you have some old enmity with her.
[1087.08] Where did Ramsha come 
in between us two?
[1089.84] Leave this.
[1092.12] Now end it.
[1093.72] And yes, you too shouldn’t have suddenly
 put the ring in my hand.
[1098.40] Does anyone do this on 
something so small?
[1100.80] yes, so? You too were screaming at me
 in front of the servants.
[1103.76] What about that?
[1104.60] Okay, I am saying sorry.
[1106.76] Are you doing me a favor 
by saying sorry?
[1110.40] I am not doing any favor.
[1113.00] I cannot live without you, 
that is why I am saying it.
[1116.04] Okay come, wear this ring,
[1119.24] or should I put it on with 
my own hands.
[1120.92] No, there is no need for that, 
I will wear it myself.
[1122.36] I am telling you,
[1125.60] I misbehaved.
[1127.64] It is different that you also 
misbehaved later.
[1132.40] But till the time I don’t put this on 
with my own hands,
[1136.32] my heart will not be at peace.
[1194.84] Alizeh, some clothes have come 
for your wedding.
[1197.48] Have a look, there are a few things 
in them, wear what you like.
[1201.36] Mama, this looks so good.
[1204.80] If you wear it, it will look even better.
[1208.00] Okay listen, I have a bad headache,
[1209.72] I have not had tea since morning.
I am going.
[1211.44] Okay, listen, send Ramsha. 
It is really heavy;
[1214.24] I will see it with her. 
Okay, fine. Fine.
[1218.48] This is so heavy.
[1222.64] Ramsha, come inside. See,
[1225.96] a few options have come for wedding.
[1227.44] Alizeh, what are you doing?
This is your scarf.
[1229.84] Come here. I am seeing how 
it will look when I wear the dress.
[1233.92] It looks good, right?
[1236.04] Alizeh…
[1237.04] But isn’t the colour a little too dark.
[1240.24] I was saying…
[1241.32] hey we had to have a power failure right now.
[1244.20] Listen, you stay here, I am going 
to get the generator started.
[1247.28] Stay here.
[1257.00] This wedding cannot take place.
[1261.40] But why?
[1265.00] Did you people only find us 
to deceive and cheat?
[1273.00] What are you saying?
[1274.92] I am right.
[1277.04] Hey, you people seemed like a 
good family and decent people.
[1281.04] And these are your actions?
[1286.36] You only found my son, for the daughter 
of yours who ran away.
[1296.88] Ramsha,
[1299.48] you know, child,
[1302.08] I had a weird fear in my heart.
[1311.52] I used to think that
[1313.68] I don’t know if I will never be able to 
see you as a bride in my life, or not.
[1324.24] Or will it ever happen that
[1327.36] you get married in my life time.
[1336.56] She is not worthy of me.
[1340.24] I will just say this to you that
[1343.44] forget the thought of this from your heart,
it would be better.
[1349.52] I will not marry her under 
any circumstances.
[1354.08] I will talk to Alizeh.
[1356.12] I will make her understand, 
I will convince her.
[1357.96] Even if she still doesn’t get convince, 
still…
[1360.28] still I will not marry Ramsha.
[1389.32] Alizeh.
[1395.60] Alizeh.
[1424.24] This is such a beautiful moment.
[1428.28] I want this moment stays 
with us forever.
[1436.88] You know,
[1440.52] these deep breaths of yours are 
the reason for my life.
[1447.48] I wish…
[1450.44] I wish these moments never 
leave our life.
[1455.32] Such beautiful moments are always 
part of our life.
[1507.00] Man, what did you do?
[1512.40] When did you come?
[1514.88] I just came. Just now.
[1517.60] Where did she go?
[1519.36] Who, she?
Ramsha.
[1522.48] Ramsha was not here when I came.
[1525.16] Okay, leave her.
[1527.04] You tell me, how do you like this scarf?
[1530.24] The designer sent some options, 
so I am looking at that.
[1535.32] Yes, it is really good.
[1536.60] The colour seems really dark, 
put it on my head and show me.
[1539.80] Here you go.
[1544.64] It is really heavy, Afnan.
[1550.68] What happened? All, okay?
[1598.92] This is such a beautiful moment.
[1603.00] I want this moment stays with us forever.
[1611.48] You know,
[1615.16] these deep breaths of yours are
 the reason for my life.
[1622.24] I wish…
[1625.20] I wish these moments never 
leave our life.
[1630.12] Such beautiful moments are always 
part of our life.
[1660.28] How dare you?
[1662.32] How dare you wear Alizeh’s scarf?
[1664.88] I didn’t wear it, Alizeh made me 
wear it herself.
[1667.44] She made you wear it and 
you wore it easily.
[1670.08] What happened at the time when 
I was talking to you considering you Alizeh.
[1673.40] Why didn’t you speak up, then?
[1680.52] The truth is you want to take 
Alizeh’s place in my life.
[1686.36] If I had to get you with illegitimate ways,
[1690.48] then it was not difficult for me.
[1697.20] But I am not in the habit of taking 
someone else’s right.
[1701.68] Hey, why will you take away her right?
[1704.60] What has that poor thing done to you?
[1712.20] And me?
[1713.72] When did I promise you that 
I will marry you?
[1716.80] Did I ever say that I love you? 
Why are you after me?
[1722.48] The truth is you are envious of me 
and my happiness.
[1726.84] You don’t want to see me happy 
with Alizeh,
[1729.00] and you are having problem with 
why I am accepting Alizeh.
[1732.32] Don’t put an allegation on me, Afnan.
[1733.84] If this is not an allegation, 
then why are you doing all this?
[1737.04] Why did you come here? 
Leave from here.
[1744.32] The truth is you love me,
[1747.20] and this love is your helplessness 
that is why you are not going from here.
[1752.64] Yes, when a person loves,
[1756.20] they also wish to get the other person,
[1759.44] and I am not embarrassed 
to say this at all,
[1763.84] that I love you even today.
[1767.44] Like you don’t have it in your control 
to put love in your heart for me,
[1773.80] just like that it is not in my control 
to take out your love from my heart.
[1779.48] I love you even today.
[1891.56] Look Afnan is getting married.
[1894.80] After marriage, he will not 
give you importance,
[1900.16] then what will you do?
[1902.84] You will sit alone and get bored.
[1908.68] That is why I am telling you 
befriend me.
[1912.24] Hey, be my friend. 
Move out of my way.
[1915.00] I am talking about coming close.
[1917.60] I mean,
[1919.40] our heart will come close 
if we become friends.
[1923.44] You are moving me away.
[1925.12] Look. Look, Ramsha, believe me.
[1931.08] I will make you have an even better 
time than Afnan.
[1959.36] There is so much liveliness at home,
[1961.96] the mayun ceremony is happening 
and you are sitting alone over here.
[1967.36] The ceremony is still happening?
[1968.76] Yes, the ceremony is going on. 
There is so much liveliness.
[1975.32] Come on. Come and see with me.
[1979.96] No, right now, I don’t feel like coming.
[1984.64] Madam Ramsha, are you feeling okay?
[1992.00] You look tired.
[1995.60] No, I am fine.
[1998.80] You are not well.
[2003.44] I can tell from your eyes, 
that you have cried a lot.
[2007.60] Are you a doctor?
[2010.96] No right?
[2012.36] Then why are you asking me 
so many questions?
[2015.24] And why have you come?
[2016.68] Elder sir has sent me to call you.
[2020.56] But you are not ready to go.
[2025.08] Now what do I say to him when I go?
[2029.04] Tell him, that I…
[2032.16] I will come in a while myself.
[2035.32] Okay fine.
[2081.44] What are you looking at?
[2084.60] I am seeing the color of my love is shining 
brighter than my expectation on your face.
[2091.84] The henna on my hand is 
witness of that color.
[2100.88] See.
[2105.76] The color of our love has 
come out so well.
[2125.40] You know, Afnan,
[2127.40] I had never thought we would 
get married so soon.
[2130.72] How could we not get married soon?
[2132.64] I have loved you a lot.
[2140.88] Even I have loved you a lot.
[2143.16] Okay, prove it then.
[2146.24] What do you mean?
[2148.40] Okay see,
[2149.80] I have also got your hand written.
[2151.40] Oh yes,
[2153.40] but my name was written in 
your hands from the start.
[2167.28] This also looks good.
[2168.72] Okay tell me,
[2170.80] where will we go for our honeymoon 
after marriage?
