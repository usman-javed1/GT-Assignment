[686.28] whom should I tell about what I have seen. I do
[697.08] n't know how many diseases I have suffered.

[1259.80] if two-four-six people did not know about our goodness, then
[1263.28] this news should reach them too, we have done a
[1268.48] great deed, right?

[1628.08] we will have to sit for some more time the
[1631.32] police will take our statement
[1634.20] you called the family members of both of them
[1637.36] told them we got in touch with them with great difficulty I
[1640.24] know they are
[1642.92] not ready to come at all they will talk to me  They were
[1645.52] not even ready to do that. With great difficulty, I
[1648.40] spoke to her sister, my Bani. You should have told them
[1651.28] that Dua is no more in this world.
[1653.00] What do you think? I would
[1654.88] not have told them. This is what I told them first.
[1657.12] You know
[1659.76] what her parents told me, that Dua has died for us a long time ago.
[1662.84] Whatever happens to her, it doesn't
[1665.56] matter to them.
[1668.50] [Music] The
[1672.64] dead body has to be handed over.
[1675.68] You call her family.
[1681.80] Sorry ma'am, nobody is actually ready to receive the dead body. The
[1685.96] dead body is
[1688.52] not in a condition to be kept here any more.
[1690.60] Anyway, this case is not new for us.
[1693.72] And if we look at it, then their parents are
[1696.52] also not at fault. In life, these people do
[1701.52] not like to live with their parents and with their restrictions. And after death,
[1704.04] their parents also do not accept them.
[1709.80] Okay, we hand over such unclaimed bodies to the police.
[1712.76] For this, some legal
[1714.92] action will be taken and a form will have to be filled.
[1717.60] One of you should come with me. Your
[1720.28] signatures will be needed.  Let's go, I'm
[1722.76] coming okay, I have gone
[1726.80] mad, this is a matter of dead body, we will get caught
[1731.28] in the police's trap, we will sign one sign
[1733.40] and then we will keep going to the jail,
[1735.56] see, no one will know that Dua was
[1737.76] with us, we will secretly run away from here, no
[1739.68] one will know anything, harm, harm,
[1741.36] we will get caught in vain, friend, now whatever had to happen has happened,
[1744.36] okay, so we should leave
[1747.08] from here, please try to understand the matter,
[1748.96] yes na, let's go
[1763.14] [Music]
[1766.32] Come on,
[1767.84] Dua, Ramsa is saying the right thing, we will go there and
[1771.32] make videos, at least it is safe,
[1773.08] look at the place, this is very dangerous, I ca
[1775.72] n't take this risk, friend, the fun is in doing dangerous work,
[1777.88] do something that no one has ever
[1779.68] done and you guys will see
[1781.96] how many views this video will get and how viral
[1784.52] this video will go, Dua, look, Ramshastri,
