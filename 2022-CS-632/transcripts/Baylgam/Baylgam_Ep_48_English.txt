Afnan? 
Hmm? Shall I say something? 
Hmm? You say that a husband and wife 
should share everything, right? So, is there anything you would like 
to share with me? I mean to say that something that 
you might not have told me because I am your wife now. What is this question all of a sudden? What a nonsensical thing to say, 
did someone say anything to you? No, like it happens often that boys befriend girls 
before marriage only, so, didn’t anything like that 
happen with you? With me? What is wrong with you? I guess you are forgetting that before becoming my wife you were 
my very good friend and my cousin. We have spent our entire life 
in this house together, whatever there is, it is in front of you,
what will I hide? Why do you look so worried, Afnan? Worried and I? Yes, Alizeh, I am worried but not because of you, 
this shipment, it needs to go out in time, you know dad gets upset. Will you have coffee? You have it. I am going to make coffee, 
I will make for you as well. Have you ever loved anyone 
except me? I mean we are human beings, and love can happen with anyone, no one has control on it. What? What is wrong with you? What is this time to ask 
all these questions? Afnan tell me? Have you ever loved any other girl? No, no. I have never even thought of 
any other girl except you. And as far as love is concerned, I have just loved you, just you. What are you cooking? I am making chicken and 
vegetable soup for uncle. Nice. By the way, you are mostly busy
 with Academy work or uncle. yes, I don’t even have anything else to do. Hmm, you are right. I feel that you should get married. Why are you looking at me 
so surprisingly? Everyone misses having 
a life partner in their life, until when will you live alone 
like this? You must get married too. I am okay like this. Ramsha, if you like someone,
you can tell me, why hide it from me? No, there is nothing like that, Alizeh. How is it possible? You must have liked someone 
at some point, there must be some person 
in your life who must have knocked on the door
of your heart. No there is no one. I cannot believe that, everybody for sure has someone 
like that in their life who they love or let’s say, they like. Have you never had anyone 
in your life who you want to marry? No. Is it like, the one you wanted to marry, 
married someone else? What happened Ramsha? Why did you get pale? No, nothing. Mom, that Alizeh has come. Alizeh who? That niece of Mr. Qasim? Yes, I have made her sit 
in the bedroom. You did, okay. My child, how is Mr. Qasim? And how is everyone at home? Yes, everyone is fine 
by the grace of God. And how is our Ramsha? 
Is she well? She must have sent you 
to know our wellbeing. It’s in her nature that she takes care of everyone, right? And it’s great that 
you came here to meet. Do you know I am very glad 
to see you here, it feels very nice to see that there is no pride
 at all in anyone in Mr. Qasim’s family, everyone meets very nicely 
by the grace of God. A person should be that way and I like such people. Thank you. Okay tell me, will you have a cold drink or 
shall I make tea for you? No, nothing. Why nothing? You sit down, I will go 
make tea for you. You are Ramsha’s cousin, right? 
You guys used to study together. I am not just Ramsha’s cousin 
but her friend too, a very good friend. When she used to be here, we used to 
talk a lot and have a lot of fun. Yes, Ramsha told me, you guys are very good friends, by the way, Ramsha is that good 
she become good friends with everyone, you know I and her have become 
good friends too. You are absolutely right, Ramsha has this talent of befriending, she talks so much that 
she befriends everyone. Yes, but now she has changed a lot, she always has sadness on her face, do you know she is not even ready
 to get married? Yes, Mom was telling she is not like 
before now, when a person’s heart breaks, they don’t remain the way they were. Boys are like that, I don’t know why girls do not 
understand this. Ramsha used to trust Afnan a lot. First that Afnan left her 
then aunt left the world, now she has lost trust in people which is why she is not ready to marry. Afnan? Hmm, Afnan. Ramsha used to love Afnan a lot, she even wanted to marry him but she didn’t have the companionship 
of Afnan in her fate. After lying so much and doing so much, what is she doing here, Afnan? Such girls are looking for a chance
to do a big robbery. What is wrong with you? 
What are you saying? You are quite educated., 
you have gotten good exposure as well, what has that girl done? The poor girl keeps on sitting
 in one corner all day. Since she has come here, she has never caused 
any harm to anyone, she hasn’t even moved a thing 
from its place and you are making such huge 
allegations about her. And you stop showing sympathy for her. Why do you always defend her so much? It is useless to argue with you. Come on, Alizeh, why doesn’t she
attend the phone? Bashir? 
Yes sir? Is Alizeh home? 
No, madam Alizeh is not home yet. Okay fine go. 
Okay. I even had the contact number 
of her office. Here it is. Hello greetings, Afnan speaking, I wanted to talk to Alizeh. Yes, I am her husband. Really? When did she leave the office? No, no, no, there is no such emergency, I will call her number. Thanks a lot. Bye. Come on, Alizeh, pick up the phone. Hey, what happened? 
Why have you come like this? You scared me. You should be scared 
because of your actions. What do you mean? 
You are saying that to me? So, do you see anyone else 
in this room, Afnan? But why are you saying this?
What has happened? Did you have any relationship 
with Ramsha or not? Don’t lie to me, Afnan. Alizeh, I think you have a 
huge misunderstanding, there is nothing like you think. Just answer my question, did you know Ramsha or not? Did you have any relationship 
with her or not? what is wrong with you Alizeh? Why are you talking like that and 
asking such questions? Afnan, just answer my question, did you know her or not? Okay, Alizeh, you are very angry 
right now… You are making me angrier, Afnan. Answer my question. Tell me. I knew her but I didn’t know her like this 
very closely, I just had contact with her 
and nothing else, I can explain this to you, you, you, relax and listen to me. Alizeh? Alizeh? Where are you going? 
Tell me, Alizeh? Look at the condition of my bike, I am thinking to buy a new bike. I’ll have to find a part time job. Take money from your dad, now he is the one getting all 
the money in his pockets. Earlier you guys had to give bit 
to uncle Sajid, now Uncle Sajid and his family 
is not there. You are saying as if 
you don’t know my dad, he has become 10 times more miser 
than he was. Take it from your dad. I am telling you that whatever needs 
to be done, I will have to do it on my own. Dad won’t buy me a cycle let alone a bike. Anyway, forget everything, tell me, 
is there any guest at your home? There must be someone, 
why do you care? Shani, I saw a huge car in front of 
your house today and I saw a girl getting out of that car. I was quite far so couldn’t see it properly and I have never seen anyone coming to 
your house in such an expensive car ever before. I will be right back. Hey Shani, where are you going? I’ll be back. 
At least finish your tea. I will be back, I will be back, 
I will be back. Hey? 
Give me 2 minutes. Shani, stop. Shani? Hey, he didn’t even pay for tea. Ramsha? You shameless girl. Don’t you feel any shame? How can you betray us big time? What have I done? Hey, what is wrong with you? 
Come with me and talk. What is wrong with me? Yes, yes, you will come to 
save your lover. What did you think? Both of you could have fooled me
together and I will keep on tolerating? I wouldn’t be able to find out anything, Fahad has told me the whole truth. You could only find my husband 
to have an affair? Alizeh, what are you saying? Please there is nothing like that, 
please keep quiet, don’t create a drama. I am not creating any drama, 
you have made me a laughing stock. How can you betray me big time? Alizeh, what has happened to you? 
You have made me a laughing stock in front of the whole world.  
Come talk to me. What has happened to me? What did you think I would 
never find out anything? And you? What is this attire, 
this scarf and all? Alizeh, Alizeh? Alizeh, 
what has happened to you? Have you gone crazy? 
Yes, I have gone crazy. She is a hypocrite. Didn’t you feel any shame doing all this? Alizeh, stop, please don’t do this,
please get quiet. Afnan, I should get quiet? I should be the one who suffers wrongdoing 
and I am the one who should stay quiet too? And you should have an affair with her? You tell me how can you betray me 
big time like this? Do one thing, strangle me so I don’t say anything and I am not 
able to say anything at all and then you can go wherever you want 
with this girl, hang out and have fun. I can explain it to you, 
please listen to me. you want me to stay quiet right, just pray that I die, because you have already killed me. I don’t even want to see your face. Hello? Yes, where are you, Afnan? I am in the office, is everything okay? yes, I actually wanted to go out, brother has taken the car 
so I thought I would go with you. Oh, I am very busy, 
I have back-to-back meetings. If you want, I can coordinate 
with the driver, he will come to you. No, no, it’s all right, 
I will manage. Bye. Listen, come, we are going somewhere. No. Come, I will also pick your bag. 
Come quickly, come. Come, come. Oh, so she is the same girl Ramsha, that’s why I thought her face 
looked familiar to me. How can I make such a huge mistake? Hello brother, greetings, I have been calling you for so long, 
but you weren’t attending. Umm, brother, come home I need to
talk about something important to you. Come home first, 
I will tell you in detail. Please come home a little quickly. Okay, bye. Mom, Ramsha did come here, right? 
You are hiding something from me, right? Don’t you understand when I said it 
once that Ramsha didn’t come. Mr. Qasim’s niece Alizeh came here, would you only believe it 
if I write it down for you? Why would his niece come here? I know Ramsha came to this house 
she met you and Annie. You are repeating the same thing again? When you don’t trust 
what your mother is saying then why are you asking? 
And you know it very well too that Ramsha won’t come 
in this house ever now. I am not convinced, I mean, what does Mr. Qasim’s niece has 
to do with our home? Ramsha must have sent her 
to know our wellbeing. Oh, so Ramsha became so nice that she sent Mr. Qasim’s niece 
to know our wellbeing? Mom, say something one could believe. I think something is not right, I have this strange feeling. Shani, you are right. Even I am finding all this 
to be very strange. There is something. Right? Uncle, I have been betrayed big time, I love Afnan so much and 
what did he do in return? This is the reward he gave me. I cannot bear it anymore now, uncle, and all this is because of her. I will kill her or I will kill myself. My child, you go to your room. 
Go, go, go, my child. Uncle, you get her out of this house, I will not tolerate her for a day more,
I don’t want to see her face in this house. Uncle, you will get her out, right? yes, my child, we will do as you say but you stop crying, please. What have I done, uncle? 
I just loved Afnan. Alizeh, look my child, stop crying, I will talk to Afnan when he comes back
but if you will cry like this, I won’t be able to do anything. what is my fault? 
Enough, enough, my child, enough. Enough, enough. Everything is destroyed. You must have liked someone 
at some point, there must be some person in your life who must have knocked 
on the door of your heart. No there is no one. I cannot believe that, everybody for sure has someone 
like that in their life who they love or let’s say, they like. Have you never had anyone in your life who you want to marry? Is it like, the one you wanted to marry, 
married someone else? You shameless girl. Don’t you feel any shame? How can you betray us big time? 
What have I done? Hey, what is wrong with you? Come with me and talk. 
What is wrong with me? Yes, yes, you will come 
to save your lover. What did you think? Both of you could have fooled me
together and I will keep on tolerating? 
I wouldn’t be able to find out anything, Fahad has told me the whole truth. You could only find my husband 
to have an affair? You haven’t left me capable to face 
my sister and niece. Dad, I admit it is my fault but trust me, whatever contact I had with Ramsha 
is a part of my past, there is no connection of it in the present. 
I know it, Ramsha has told me. You didn’t even bother telling me. Do you have any idea what a wife goes through 
if she finds out that her husband has relations 
with another girl, hmm? You are the one responsible for 
Alizeh’s sorrows and her tears, Afnan. Yes, but dad, I was just friends 
with Ramsha, nothing else. What friendship? When is there ever a friendship 
between a man and a woman, tell me? There is always evil between a man 
and a woman, that is what we have heard 
from our elders, right? And his is the reason for the destruction
of society, try to understand. A relationship is what can be owned 
and respected and that you can be proud of. Anyway, today the strict decisions that I have to 
take, I never wanted to do them and you have forced me so I have decided that Ramsha will no longer live 
in this house now. Ramsha won’t live here? What are you saying, dad? 
How is that possible? When I am the one at fault then you cannot punish Ramsha for 
my mistake by putting her through this and just imagine where will 
the poor girl go from here? Her own home is not safe for her. I have said that Ramsha won’t 
live here anymore. Yes, dad but I am telling you that
 if you just once… I won’t listen to you anymore now, Afnan. I have told you that Ramsha 
won’t leave here now, so, she won’t. It is better if we don’t talk about this 
anymore. Leave for now.
