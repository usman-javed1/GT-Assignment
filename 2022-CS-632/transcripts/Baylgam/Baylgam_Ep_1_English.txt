Annie! Look at that. What a car, man? Oh.
Come on, let’s make a video. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Annie. Yes?
When everyone will watch this video…. Yes?
They will go crazy. Everyone will feel this is my car. Make a video like this.
I will stand here. Take my phone.
Quickly take my phone. I will stand here and
you make a good video of me. Ready? Come on. But using someone’s car like this… Come on, quickly make the video.
Don’t think so much. Ready? I am coming from here. Wait.
Okay. Yes. We will go in your charity… This is my car. I think you were trying to open the door. I am sorry. Show me. Show me.
Show me. Quickly. Oh my God, such a pretty video. You will see, this video will have so many likes
and views that you cannot imagine. This video will surely get viral. You said the same about the last video. It only had 50 likes. It didn’t go viral. This one will surely get likes and this one will surely go viral.
Remember that. But, this mister seemed like a spoiled brat
of some rich man. If he has an objection, that we uploaded the video on Tik Tok
without his permission, then what will you do? I will find a solution for this. After all, I will not upload this video so easily. I will edit it, put a good song it, I will add some effects, then the video will be completely ready. Fine. Fine. The effects have been added. The filter has been applied. Now come,
attend it. Some song… Come on. Come on. See.
Yes? Your views are increasing further
compared to earlier. You know, I am getting messages. Everyone is saying that my new hairstyle,
and hair colour looks really good. Wow. Wow. Now see, if you follow this style, then gradually
your followers will increase. Oh man, I don’t want to increase
my followers gradually. I want that I become famous overnight, people know me,
I grow a lot of followers. I don’t know when this will happen, Annie. It will happen. It will happen gradually. I hope so. The function is so good… look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Man, Annie, I want that
I become just like her. You will be. You will be more than her. Ramsha, just keep on working hard. But Annie, she has a lot of followers. I want that even I become this famous
overnight, I too have so many followers.
Everyone goes around me like this. I don’t know when this happen. She gets a million views on every video. It will happen. I told you to work hard. Okay. May I come in sir? Come in. Good morning sir. Please send Miss Anum to my room. Thank you. May I come in, sir? Yes, come. Yes, sir? Miss Anum, I had given you
a file two days back. Sir, actually I was on leaves for the past
two days, even today… You do one thing, take permanent leave. What?
Yes. I don’t want such employees in my office,
that take offs every second day. This is really irresponsible behavior. You please leave. But sir, I had informed sir Qasim,
my father was hospitalized. Look miss Anum,
that is your personal matter and this is a professional environment. I don’t it to get ruined
because of one employee. When I had told you I need the file
in two days, then it was your responsibility that
you should have delivered it to me. Because of you my contract got delayed. You please leave from here. And yes, don’t go to dad… I mean Mr. Qasim. Stop manipulating him. This is my final decision. You may leave. Yes? Fine. Make him sit in the conference room.
I am coming. Thank you. You don’t worry,
everything will be fine. Greetings.
Greetings sir. Hey, why are you people standing here?
Go and do your work. Go child. Greetings. Greetings. Anum, what happened? Hey, why are you crying, child? Anum, what happened?
Tell me child. Sir Afnan fired me from the job. But why? Where are you lost? Nowhere. I am searching for that hero. Maybe I will get his Facebook account
by chance. Whose? Hey the same with whose car
I made a Tik Tok in university. His?
Yes. Maybe I can help you find his account. You? How can you help me? I can, I am not that useless. No. No. I mean how can you help me? Do you know him? Obviously not, but his car was in the university, so he must have someone
in the university. You are right. Why did I not think of that? If he came to the university then he would also have someone
he knows there. This means we will go to the university
tomorrow and find out about him. Done.
Done. By the way, if you find his ID,
will you say sorry? Huh, sorry for what? You were making a Tik Tok
with his car, that’s why. Have you gone mad? Who says sorry on something so small? Then why are you searching for the ID? I don’t know. I just wanted to see him one more time. Oh, okay. What is wrong? Did you see my Tik Tok from yesterday? Come, I will show you. I made a Tik Tok yesterday,
check out how pretty I look. See how many likes I got. Your outfit looks so pretty.
Right? Yes…
You know… May I come in sir?
Yes, come in. Come in. Sir, I had to get your signature
on these. What is it? Okay, give it. This. Over here? At the bottom?
Sir, here. Fine. If you want any other signatures, get it done by Mr. Afnan, okay? Okay.
Thank you. May I come in, dad.
Hey, come in. come in. What happened? You got late.
Where were you? I went to the hospital. Are you fine? Yes. Yes, I am fine. That girl who works in our office, Anum. Yes? Her father’s condition is not fine, so I had told her that you spend
your most time with your papa. So, if they need anything, Afnan,
then don’t say no to them. Hmmm…. dad…. I was about to share this with you. Actually, now Anum will spend time
with her father. Because now she will not work in this office.
I have fired her. What? Why?
But I saw her in the office. She was working outside. Really? So, this means that she has already
complained to you about me. Hey, what is wrong?
Why would she complain? She was crying. I saw her, so what would that poor thing
complain about? Afnan, do you know the best action
of a person is that of empathy. Dad, why don’t you understand me? I know. I know, you have a lot of pain in
your heart for your employees. But all of them together take advantage
of your leniency, they deceive you. Child, I don’t have to account
for what they do. I have to account for what I do. Anyway, let your anger go. You know, someone is a little
angrier than you. More than me?
Yes. Who? The one you had to drop and
you are nowhere to be found. Alizay. Oh God, Alizay had…
Yes. Careful. Listen to me. How can I forget dad that today was
her flight, and her time…. You shouldn’t forget either. Now
don’t tell her that you had forgotten, tell her I was waiting for papa,
he came to the office and I came. Fine, dad. Whatever I remember
out of this in front of her, I will say it. If she agrees, then. But I have to leave now, can I go?
Yes, go, go. Okay, thanks dad.
I love you. Live long.
Pray for me. Your prayers are answered.
Pray that I survive. Okay bye. Best of luck. Mama, I am not going for the first time. Why are you worried?
I have gone earlier as well. Hey, when you step out of the home,
I become restless. You are going to Islamabad right now. So, when is Islamabad so far?
It is just a two-hour flight. And see, as soon as my work ends,
I will come back. Mama, you fix your mood. Hey, aunt what is wrong? Why are you explaining to her for
no reason and getting worried? You don’t know, once she decides something,
she does that. Okay tell me,
is your packing done? Yes, all my packing is done. Good. Okay, you people chat,
I will get something to eat. Hey, no, dont get anything for me. Okay sit. By the way, why? Why should she not get
something for you? You lost your appetite hearing
about me leaving? Are you mad? Don’t be so mistaken. When you leave,
there will be peace at home. Why don’t you say all that
which is in your heart, or is it just my imagination
that you like me? What happened? Why are you looking at me like that? No. Nothing. Ramsha. Annie, it is good that you came.
I have edited the video. Check it. Tell me how is it?
Look at this. I have an even better news than this. What? I have found the ID of that hero. What? The one with the car? Yes, him. Tell me. Quickly tell me. Turn on your Facebook. We will search on my Facebook,
tell me quickly. Write Afnan. Afnan?
Yes. Wow, the name is good.
Okay, which one? Go to the options,
scroll down. This. This. Look.
There he is. Oh, what a picture. Awesome. Wait,
I will message him. But no, I will not message him right now,
I will message him later. But scroll. Oh wow.
I found him, right? This is the same car
we took a picture with. Did you drop her? Yes. Was she worried? Hey, no, what is there to worry about? She is a very strong girl.
You still treat her like a small girl. For me she is like a small girl till today. You know, I stay so worried for her. Don’t worry about her. She will take good care of her. Come on, don’t worry,
get me some good coffee, please. Okay fine. Your presence has really increased
the beauty of this video. If you allow me,
then can I upload this video? Is the message gone? Please reply. Reply. Reply. Yes, yes, I will call you back. Okay. Okay bye. Aunt, is the coffee ready? Yes, the coffee is ready.
I am bringing it. Your presence has really increased
the beauty of this video. If you allow me, then
can I upload this video? Yes, if you want to upload it,
then go ahead. I have no objections.
Thank you. Aunt, I am waiting. His reply is here. Yes, if you want to upload it,
then go ahead. I have no objections. Oh my God, what a voice this man has. Ramsha. Yes? Hey, are you going somewhere? No, why? What happened? So why are you so dressed up? Mama, I got ready to make a TIk Tok. Ramsha. Papa. I think he got my ring light. My ring light.
Careful. Yes, papa. I am coming.
I am coming. His father has made her go mad. Ramsha. Yes, papa, I am here. Here your light. You got it? You are so good,
thank you. How is it possible that my daughter
makes a wish and I don’t fulfill it Thank you papa.
What was the need to bring it? You fulfill every wish of hers. This love and affection of yours
has spoiled her. We have one daughter, wife of mine, if we don’t care for her,
then should we care for the neighbours? Serve food, I am going
to wash my hands and face. Yes. Yes. Hey wow, now I will make such a Tik Tok,
mama, that you will keep on looking. Ramsha. Ramsha, I had told you to check on the milk,
I had kept it for boiling. I am so sorry, aunt. I completely forgot. It slipped my mind.
I am so sorry. Obviously, if you get your attention
out of the mobile, then you will focus on something else. Sister in law, your daughter doesn’t
pay attention to anything. Hey, Salma, what is wrong? She always has her mobile in her hand, she is only focusing on videos. Obviously, why will she do any work? I had asked her to check on the milk
in the kitchen. My daughter Annie is also there, whatever work I give her she does it
with so much responsibility. But she? She doesn’t pay attention to anything. I had cleaned the stove in the morning. Come to the kitchen and
have a look at the stove. The milk has burned and stuck on to it. Hey, Salma, don’t worry.
I will clean the stove. Sister, it is not about cleaning the stove. Even I can do that, but it is not good for girls to always have
mobiles in their hands and make videos. Annie. Annie, child, come to the kitchen
with me. I am tired of making Tik Toks today. By the way, let me check how many likes
and views I got. Wow, the likes and views of this video is
more than my other videos. But still, compared to other people the likes
and views on my video a really less. He is not replying. It is here. I am Ramsha from Nazimabad…. no, no, Nazimabad sounds weird. Clifton. Block? What will be the block? Five. Block five. I am a student and you? Hey, the reply is here. Oh, you know he seemed like a
businessman. The dressing was amazing too. I will talk to him more. Here you go. You know, I spoke to him on call
for one whole hour, and in all this hour I found him
to be so decent and sober, and he is really handsome as well and he is rich too. You know I checked his entire profile, I checked every single picture of his well. Ramsha, these profiles are often fake
and this is happening a lot nowadays. Listen, I have been using social media 
for a lot of years and I know well. which is a fake profile and which is real. So, you don’t tell me this. Don’t you know? I was the one who had caught 
Shazia’s boyfriend. How was he fooling you all through 
a fake profile? Yes, you are right about that. Anyway, leave it. Tell me, 
what did you talk about? Nothing. Just hello, hi. For one hour you did hi and hello? If you don’t want to tell me, then don’t, 
but don’t lie to me. We didn’t talk about much. Come, 
I will tell you what we spoke about. I swear Alizay, I cannot tell you when you are not here 
there is so much peace and comfort in this home. Okay, so me not being there has 
brought peace to the home. Absolutely. You are not here, so there is peace. You know, if you were here then
you wouldn’t have been able to feel it. So, I called to thank you. Okay, then just saying thanks won’t work. Send me a bouquet, some gifts, some chocolates, because the peace that is there 
because of me not being there, that will be there for almost 
one more week. What do you mean? You will stay there for another week? Yes, man, I am helpless, 
what can I do? You know, the project is 
nearing the end. So, I will have to stay for some more time, 
like a week. Yes, but one more day works, but the whole week? No, no, you shouldn’t work with such people. Huh? What do you mean? What do you mean I shouldn’t work? Meaning, such useless people. Hey, the ones who don’t know how long 
it will take their work to be complete, how can you work with them? They already knew Afnan, I was the one who was thinking that 
the work would be done in two days and I would come back or else the schedule was the everyone
will stay here. But now I am thinking 
I will stay here. No, no, no need for you to stay there. You just come back. Hey, but Afnan.
Hey, no buts. You are coming, so you are coming. Okay fine, I will come back. But what about the peace of your home? It won’t remain. Hey it may not remain, but… Okay fine, I will come. Fine. Take care of yourself, 
I will talk to you later. Okay bye. Bye. see, I had told you yesterday as well, 
I cannot talk to anyone like this. This could be a fake account. If you want to talk to me,
then do it on a video call. Look, this cannot be a girl’s voice. And why would my voice be fake? A person should be this smart. Nowadays the times have
become really advance, this could also be a software too, through which you are making 
a girl’s voice. I have told you, 
you talk to me face to face or else I cannot talk to you. Mister aren’t you showing
too many tantrums. Anyway, fine, if you don’t want to believe me, 
then don’t. it doesn’t matter to me. 
It is up to you. Fine, as you see fit. I was just saying that 
if you are talking, then come in front. And the second option is stop talking. 
Simple. So many tantrums? It feels like it is some girl, 
who is throwing a lot of tantrums. You are still on the phone? Ramsha, you don’t care about me at all.
Whether I live or die, why would you care. Why? What happened to you? And why are you talking like aunt? I am so worried, 
you are still on your phone. Annie, if you tell me then I will know, 
speak up. The wedding planner had talked 
to mama about a proposal. They are coming today. Oh, so what is the need to worry in this? You should get used to all this. After all, this is not the first time 
a proposal is coming for you. You should get used to all this now. Don’t get too over. Come and help me. Come tell me 
what I should wear. Come on. Hey, I am not going anywhere, 
I have a lot of work. Ramsha, get up. 
Come on, help me. Tell me what I should wear. 
Please. Please come. Wait, I will come. Pick out a dress yourself, 
you should know. Your dressing sense is much better. Aunt, what happened? 
What are you doing? Why? Can I not do all this? Since the gardener went on leaves, I thought I would practice. Okay fine, you are done with your practice. I don’t like you doing all this work. After all, I am not doing anything,
I am getting bored. I will do it The one because of whom 
you are getting bored, talk to them. I just spoke to her and came… Aunt, you are really sharp. When did I say that 
I am bored because of her. In fact, she is not home, 
there a lot of peace. There is so much silence in my heart, 
my home, I am really enjoying it. You know, after sister-in-law left, you were four years old, 
when you came in my arms. Who would know you better than me? I know everything when you want what,
and what do you want. You know there is something, no matter how much I thank God, 
it is less that he gave me an aunt like you. After mama passed away, you didn’t let me feel for a moment that she is not in this world. You gave me the same amount of love 
and care for me, that if she was alive, 
she would have given me. And you know what the best thing is? You care for everyone, but you never let anyone feel it. Now you look at brother, he has never let Alizay feel that 
her father is not there. Us elders live for the children. Okay tell me, why did you not go
to the office? Are you okay? Yes, I am fine, but I didn’t feel like it. So, I told dad 
that I am not coming today. But now I feel I made 
the wrong decision. I am really bored. But I am not bored because of her. 
Okay? You come on, 
I will make good coffee for you. Come on.
Come on. Come on. and you shouldn’t do this work 
of the gardener, you know. Oh hello, what are you doing? Will you put on the maroon lip colour? You will look like an aunty. 
Put on the pink one. This suits me. This suits me. Fine, 
wear it. Wear it. Become an aunt. 
I am leaving, go to hell. Okay, okay, Ramsha. 
Don’t get upset. I will wear the pink one. 
Should I put on this one? Yes. Wow, see, you look so good. 
Listen to me. Great. Fix my scarf too. I will fix your scarf, 
first put on the blush well. You know, if I was not there what would 
have happened to you Annie? You had taken out such bad clothes 
to wear, out of fashion. And see how you have 
styled your hair, and you were putting 
on maroon lip colour? You would have looked like an aunty,
in fact, you would have looked like a mother. Now I understand. That is why so many proposals 
of yours got rejected, because you make this weird dressing 
and go in front of them. Idiot. Come on, quickly fix your makeup. Hey, what is wrong? Stop laughing, for God’s sake. The boy’s family is here, 
be quick. Come on. Okay, okay, you go, 
we will come in two minutes. Let me fix her hair. It has been so long. And listen don’t take more than 
five minutes, understand? Be quick now. 
Mama, we are coming. We are coming. Let your hair fall in front a little, 
don’t do too much. Okay? Come on. Hey, hey, where are you coming? No, the boy’s family has come and you should make the boy’s family wait,
it is a good thing. I will go and see how good looking 
the boy is, okay? And till I don’t come, stay here. 
Understand? Have you gone mad? 
I cannot come like this. I will go with you,
you come to get me. Good. Yes, my son is really capable. He has become a doctor. 
He is in the hospital in the morning and the evening he does his clinic. Are you Annie’s father? No, no, I am Annie’s uncle and this is her aunt.
Mehnaz, my wife. This is my younger brother, 
Anwar and his wife, Salma, they are her parents. Yes, all of us live together. On the face of it, Annie is Anwar 
and Salma’s daughter, but believe me she is as dear to us 
like our Ramsha. Sister-in-law is right. Actually, we don’t find any difference 
in our children. Call the daughter. 
Salma, call Annie. This…this is Ramsha, 
my daughter. Ramsha, greet them. Greetings. Gretings. 
Live long child. Ramsha child, 
why did you not bring Annie? Go call her, bring her. Yes, yes, I will bring her. You have something. 
Sure. Annie. Annie. Annie, my sister, sister, your ship has sunk. What happened? Annie, you are ruined, 
did you find out? What happened Ramsha, 
tell me quickly, please. Don’t ask me what I saw downstairs 
and came. Don’t ask. Don’t ask. What did you see, Ramsha? You know those people have come 
downstairs with your proposal. I know this, quickly tell me the rest. The boy who has come along, he is bald. 
He has no hair on his head. Ramsha, I know. Are you serious? You know that boy is bald, still you agreed to marry him? 
Have you gone mad? So? Mama has told me that the proposal 
is good, the boy is a doctor. So, what if he is a doctor, 
he is also bald. You know he looks like a uncle. No, no, mama was telling me he is thirty,
thirty-two years old. Don’t worry, I know all this. You know it all? Still you agree 
to get married? Have you gone mad? 
Will you marry a bald man? You think yourself if after marriage 
you go out with him, then he won’t look like your husband,
he will look like your father-in-law. What justifications will you 
give to everyone? And all your friends, they will make so much fun of you,
they will laugh at you. What all will you say to everyone, Annie, and tell me something, do you remember 
that Arfa incident. Everyone made so much fun 
of that poor thing, she used to cry so much. How will you face everyone Annie? What do I do right now, Ramsha? There is just one solution. Get up. Don’t bring more for me. I am full. 
Okay. I was just going to stop, but you 
brought it so I will eat it. What has happened that both you father and son 
have lost their appetite. My appetite is lost cause of happiness. Such a good proposal came 
for our daughter. I am not hungry in my happiness. Now I pray to God that we get a 
good response from there. We will get a yes from them. I found out from their behavior 
that they will say yes, or else they wouldn’t have prayed 
so much for Annie when they left. after all, our Annie is no less 
than anyone. See. She is simple, she was not 
wearing any makeup. Yes. I didn’t think about this. When Annie and Ramsha both came 
to the room, I thought Annie is wearing makeup. Hey, tell her. She would have 
put on a little. She would have done it in a way 
that simplicity would remain and the makeup would be done too. Girls today are really smart. They are not like you. 
Yes, that is true. May God just give her a good fate. Amen. By the way, where is she? 
Does she not want to have food? She had food, 
she is studying in her room. She is really smart. As soon as she found out 
she is going to a doctor’s home, she started paying attention 
to her studies. He is always after her. Give me a bite, 
I feel this kebab is for me. I will bring more, 
it will take a minute. No, no, I won’t have more. 
After all, my tummy is out. Okay. Kehwa. 
I am giving it. Huh? So soon? No, no, not so soon. You please wait for some time. Yes… What happened? Who are you talking to so late at night? Whoever I talk to, 
why do you care? Mind your own business, understand? After all, my friend on the phone. Do you want to talk to her? Should I make you talk to her?
Here, talk to her. I am not interested. But tell your friends not to call you 
at this hour. Hello mister, don’t try to act like my father. She is my friend, she will call me when she wants, 
and I will answer the call when I want. Show this attitude to your sister,
not me.
