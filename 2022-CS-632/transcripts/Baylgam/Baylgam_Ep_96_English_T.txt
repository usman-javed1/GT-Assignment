[17.80] You will deny me in front
 of everyone, right?
[20.20] I will show you, your video.
[23.24] Alizeh, you…
[24.28] Hold this and see.
[26.00] Who is this?
[26.88] Look at it carefully.
[27.68] Greetings, guys,
[28.52] I hope you all are fine,
[30.16] so I have a huge surprise 
for you all
[32.08] and that surprise is,
[33.48] a famous TikToker,
[35.28] Ramsha by the name 
of Shopping Girl,
[37.08] who is doing what these 
days and where is she,
[39.76] where is she nowadays,
[40.84] I am about to tell you all 
this in my video today.
[43.48] I am sure you all want to know
[45.04] that the girl who went viral 
on social media is in
[47.20] what condition now.
[48.48] After getting viral by 
a social media video,
[50.80] and saying bye-bye to social
 media overnight, Ramsha
[53.80] has married a very famous 
businessman Afnan Qasim,
[57.48] I am sure you guys 
won’t believe all this,
[59.96] that is why I have proof 
of all this,
[62.04] look at this video.
[139.52] this… all this..
[163.64] Afnan,
[166.32] I trusted you more than
 my daughter,
[182.80] I always used to defend 
you in everything,
[204.40] I always loved you 
like my own children
[207.88] and what did you give 
me in return?
[222.68] Yeah?
[224.64] Grief, pain, trouble?
[243.28] Do you even realize Afnan 
what have you done?
[251.44] Aunt, I am sorry,
[253.32] I know that you guys might have 
been hurt by whatever I did, but
[256.84] at least listen to me once that…
[257.88] But what?
[259.56] But what Afnan?
[262.48] You married Ramsha?
[271.60] What were you thinking
 when you did that?
[281.56] You have brought a second 
wife on my daughter?
[296.64] You didn’t think about 
your wife or your baby?
[300.00] I mean you became so selfish,
[302.24] you should have at least 
cared about someone.
[304.96] Afnan,
[307.24] you ruined everything.
[317.48] I used to ask brother to get 
this girl out of our house,
[324.28] she is a snake,
[335.08] she bit,
[337.00] she bit everyone.
[364.00] You ruined everything.
[394.52] Afnan, stay away from me.
[399.40] Please stay away from me.
[402.80] Alizeh, cool down and listen to me,
[405.24] I am telling you that you…
[406.28] I don’t want to listen to anything,
[408.84] you did what you wanted to.
[417.84] I don’t want to listen to 
anything you want to say,
[421.08] I am hating you, your existence,
 your presence.
[425.68] Dude, why are you not 
listening to me, Alizeh?
[427.80] You have no idea what 
was the situation…
[428.76] What do you want?
[430.68] What do you want?
[432.20] You want me to harm myself?
[433.84] Is that what you want?
[435.04] That I should hurt myself.
[436.72] No.
[436.92] You know I get crazy 
when I am angry.
[438.80] Alizeh, please don’t cause 
any harm to yourself,
[441.84] please. I am not coming 
close to you
[444.04] What did you think Afnan?
[446.88] What did you think
[448.08] that I will cry like a typical woman
[449.72] and die in the corner?
[452.32] Not at all,
[453.88] you have killed me while 
I am still alive,
[456.36] but I will kill you and that Ramsha.
[462.00] Listen Alizeh…
[462.68] Now just wait and watch what I do.
[465.96] Alizeh, listen to me, you are angry ..
[468.28] No Afnan,
[469.96] I am not angry,
[477.08] I guess you are not 
listening to me Afnan,
[480.64] just wait and watch 
I do now with you.
[492.28] Alizeh?
[508.60] What?
[509.72] What are you thinking?
[513.04] I am thinking what if Alizeh
[515.32] had seen me in this house?
[516.68] She didn’t see you,
[519.64] so why do you worry about 
this for no reason?
[523.84] Will you answer my question?
[526.80] What question?
[529.64] I want you to disclose to 
everyone about our marriage. ,
[535.80] Afnan,the way everyone 
respects Alizeh as your wife,
[540.32] I want that respect too.
[546.08] That is the problem, Afnan,
[547.76] she will never do anything,
[550.32] because she knows
[551.72] she won’t catch everyone’s attention 
just for some small robbery.
[560.40] Try to understand Afnan,
[562.92] she is very clever,
[569.56] how cleverly she first took 
sympathy from Uncle first,
[578.16] she pretended to be innocent 
in front of everyone
[580.84] and then made her place in 
his heart by taking care of him,
[583.80] this is all her planning, 
I am telling you Afnan.
[738.64] Have you ever fallen in love with
 any other girl apart from me?
[744.84] I mean we are human beings,
[746.68] we can fall in love with anyone,
[748.84] it is not in anyone’s control.
[752.84] What?
[754.40] What is wrong with you?
[756.00] What is this time to ask 
all these questions?
[759.44] Afnan, tell me?
[762.84] Have you ever 
loved any other girl?
[768.84] No, no.
[772.08] I have never thought of 
any girl except you ever.
[780.72] And as far as love is concerned,
[784.32] I have just loved you,
[787.00] just you.
[806.84] who do you trust the 
most in this whole world?
[810.68] On Afnan.
[814.44] What happened?
[815.36] Why are you laughing?
[819.24] He is my husband,
[820.80] offcourse if I wouldn’t trust him,
 who else will I trust?
[825.04] A person should be their 
life partner.
[828.72] Yes, but I will never 
marry such a girl
[831.76] who already has an affair
[833.52] and who continues to have
 an affair after marriage too.
[838.32] What are you trying to say?
[842.96] Please don’t crack 
riddles with me.
[846.64] I just have one answer 
to all these riddles.
[855.04] Ramsha.
[872.16] Ramsha used to trust Afnan a lot.
[880.48] Afnan left her first
[882.08] and then Aunt left this world,
[885.96] now she has lost trust in people
[893.52] that is why she is not 
ready to marry.
[898.92] Af Afnan?
[901.76] Hmm,
[903.04] Afnan.
[907.08] Ramsha used to love 
Afnan a lot
[909.92] and wanted to marry him too,
[914.80] but she didn’t have Afnan’s 
companionship in her fate.
[925.88] I feel sad,
[928.20] not on you but myself,
[931.32] in fact I feel sad about 
my love that
[933.12] I couldn’t prove to you yet
[934.76] how sincere I am with you,
[936.52] I couldn’t make you believe 
that my love for you…
[938.92] Afnan, who was that girl?
[945.52] So all this is happening
 because of that girl?
[948.80] She was an acquaintance.
[953.24] I went to a restaurant so
 I met her there
[956.08] and spoke to her for a while
[958.12] and you are creating this huge fight...
[960.40] ...with me for an unimportant person.
[962.24] Unimportant girl?
[964.92] You lied to me for an unimportant girl?
[969.08] You could have told me the truth as well.
[971.00] I was joking, dude,
[973.64] I was teasing you like I always do.
[990.24] Alizeh listen to me?
[992.72] Alizeh, listen to me, what has happened?
[994.16] At least listen to me.
[995.12] What is your problem, Afnan?
[996.80] I told you not to talk to me.
[999.76] Okay,
[1001.04] then do one thing,
[1001.76] you must think and I will think too,
[1004.16] because if you do this, then
[1006.28] I will marry someone else.
[1011.24] Stop testing my patience,
[1014.16] you have lied enough,
[1016.24] how much more will you lie?
[1019.40] I saw you with that girl
 with my eyes,
[1022.72] who was that girl, Afnan?
[1026.16] Afnan, who was that girl?
[1027.60] Alizeh, listen to me.
[1028.80] How can you do this to me?
[1030.96] Alizeh, Alizeh you…
[1033.16] What are you trying to say? Say it?
[1034.76] okay, I can only answer 
if you allow me to speak.
[1038.72] Alizeh, you are getting it wrong,
[1040.20] it is not what you think.
[1041.60] I don’t want to talk to you at all. Move.
[1043.36] Alizeh, please I am telling 
you to trust me,
[1045.24] what is wrong?
[1045.76] I trusted you the most,
[1047.64] and what did you do?
[1049.24] You broke my trust.
[1051.84] I am so disappointed with you,
 Afnan.
[1111.00] Ramsha?
[1112.96] Ramsha?
[1115.64] Ramsha, where are you?
[1118.64] Why did you do this?
[1125.44] Why did you do it?
[1128.00] Hey, I told you,
[1130.40] I told you
[1131.24] that I will tell everyone about our 
marriage when I get a chance
[1137.32] then why did you do this?
[1140.00] What? What has happened? 
Tell me?
[1149.72] Why are you yelling so much?
[1151.00] I don’t get it what are you
 talking about, Afnan?
[1153.40] Shut up!
[1155.84] I was mad,
[1157.68] I was mad that I fell in
 love with you,
[1165.12] Aunt even told me such
 girls never change but I..
[1169.64] Hey, do you know 
I have become such ...
[1171.84] ....a laughingstock in the 
whole world because of you?
[1174.16] You have made my life a show.
[1185.88] People are laughing at 
me at places,
[1187.44] making fun of me.
[1189.56] Why did you do this?
[1191.00] Enough, Afnan.
[1197.20] What has happened? 
At least tell me.
[1198.76] Why are you putting 
allegations on me?
[1204.32] And it was your wish as 
well to marry me.
[1211.84] You haven’t done me any favor.
[1213.84] Yes, yes, I made a mistake,
[1216.28] I made a mistake that 
I showed my wish to marry you
[1223.84] because I used to feel
 you are not the old Ramsha,
[1226.08] you have changed
[1228.24] but I didn’t know that you 
are still the same Ramsha
[1232.56] who fools people,
[1234.00] do you want to see how?
[1236.64] Look at this.
[1237.56] Greetings, guys,
[1238.52] I hope you all are fine,
[1239.84] so I have a huge surprise for you all
[1242.24] and that surprise is,
[1243.52] a famous TikToker,
[1245.36] Ramsha by the name 
of Shopping Girl,
[1247.12] who is doing what these 
days and where is she,
[1249.88] where is she nowadays,
[1250.84] I am about to tell you all 
this in my video today.
[1253.44] I am sure you all want to know
[1255.36] that the girl who went viral 
on social media is in
[1257.36] what condition now.
[1258.56] After getting viral by 
a social media video,
[1260.76] and saying bye-bye to social 
media overnight, Ramsha
[1263.72] has married a very famous
 businessman Afnan Qasim,
[1267.44] I am sure you guys won’t 
believe all this,
[1269.72] that is why I have 
proof of all this,
[1272.04] look at this video.
[1288.92] I didn’t expect such a cheap 
act from your end, Ramsha,
[1292.28] I never even want to see
 your face ever again.
[1293.96] No, Afnan.
[1295.04] Afnan, this is a lie,
 I haven’t done all this.
[1297.72] Don’t you trust me that 
why will I do this, Afnan?
[1300.36] Am I mad that I will cause
 you trouble?
[1302.12] ’
[1302.24] All this is a lie, I haven’t 
done this, Afnan.
[1305.64] Do you want to say something 
else too or that is it?
[1308.72] After this act,
[1310.52] I never even want to see 
your face Ramsha,
[1312.88] never ever come in
 my way from now.
[1314.56] Afnan, stop, what 
has happened to you?
[1316.84] I didn’t even know that 
Areeba has made any video
[1319.12] and even uploaded it,
[1319.88] had I known it,
[1321.00] I would have refused her,
[1321.96] why would I do it on purpose?
[1323.00] Don’t lie to me.
[1325.84] The girl whose name 
you are taking
[1327.52] you have done all this
 along with her,
[1333.88] but why did you do this?
[1336.64] Where did my love fall short?
[1339.44] Tell me? Answer me?
[1341.24] You are getting it wrong,
[1342.36] there is nothing like this,
[1343.36] why will I hurt you?
[1344.88] Why will I trouble you? Just think.
[1346.60] I have understood now,
[1349.28] only now I have understood
 you well, Ramsha.
[1352.84] Only now I have understood 
who you are.
[1359.60] I married you,
[1361.08] made you the honor of my house.
[1368.20] I fulfilled the promise 
I made to my dad ...
[1370.84] ...who was dying and 
what did you do?
[1378.24] You defamed me in 
the whole society,
[1380.92] nothing else.
[1388.96] Tell me where did my love fall short
[1396.08] that you cheated on me?
[1397.64] Afnan, I didn’t cheat you,
[1406.72] why don’t you believe me?
[1408.36] Don’t you believe me?
[1409.36] Areeba has done all this,
[1410.52] why will I do this, Afnan?
[1414.32] If I hadn’t promised my Dad,
[1417.36] I would have taken you and thrown
[1418.60] you out of my life right here, right now.
[1430.88] I feel disgusted in myself that
 I chose a girl like you.
[1435.36] Enough,
[1436.84] it’s good you did this,
[1439.44] at least my eyes have 
been opened now.
[1448.92] I am telling you not to show 
me your face ever again.
[1452.44] No Afnan,
[1453.32] what is wrong with you?
[1454.32] How can you say this, Afnan?
[1455.88] What is all this that 
you are saying?
[1457.56] Afnan there is nothing
 like this,
[1458.68] Afnan why would I do this?
[1459.48] Ramsha don’t do this.
[1460.24] What you are saying
 is hurting me, Afnan.
[1461.24] Afnan I will die…
[1461.80] Die!
[1468.52] If you want to die,
 then go die.
[1478.40] And after what you have done,
[1480.08] it will be better if you die.
[1511.32] Why were you saying that
 I will marry you?
[1514.16] How did you even think this?
 Tell me?
[1517.08] What is wrong Afnan?
[1519.00] You love me, who will 
you marry if not me?
[1522.48] What has happened to you
[1524.76] if I talked to you nicely twice
 it means I will marry you?
[1528.88] You didn’t just talk to me 
nicely a couple of times,
[1531.08] you have always 
taken care of me,
[1532.84] and this is not a friendship,
[1534.12] you have been 
concerned for me,
[1535.56] you saved me from a trouble.
[1536.88] I just showed sympathy
 towards to you,
[1540.48] I thought that she is 
probably a naïve girl
[1542.24] who might need my guidance
[1544.64] and if I can make her
 a good friend
[1546.40] and guide her,
[1547.44] save her from bad people,
[1548.84] so this was not love.
[1564.08] What do you think that
[1566.04] I am not marrying you
[1567.80] because I am busy 
in my work?
[1570.64] Yes.
[1571.12] Are you mad?
[1574.08] Are you out of your mind?
[1576.84] How can you even think
 I will marry you?
[1580.28] It is my fault,
[1581.96] it is my fault I shouldn’t 
have befriended you at all,
[1583.80] but I was out of my mind,
[1585.88] I thought she is an innocent girl
[1587.40] and gets herself in trouble 
so let’s help her but you,
[1591.56] you have been after me now.
[1597.12] Okay, then kill me
[1600.16] but I won’t marry you.
[1604.08] I can’t kill you even if I want to,
[1606.68] but if you don’t listen
 to me today,
[1611.20] I will definitely kill myself.
[1613.60] No.
[1614.88] Now tell me what is 
your answer?
[1621.40] Either you see my dying 
in front of your eyes,
[1626.92] or we unite today, tell me 
should I kill myself?
[1629.08] Okay, you won’t speak like this,
[1632.04] I will only count to 3,
[1639.92] then my dead body will 
be in front of you.
[1643.48] 1 2
[1649.44] I am ready.
[1662.96] I want you to disclose to everyone
 about our marriage.
[1668.88] Afnan, the way everyone 
respects Alizeh as your wife,
[1673.88] I want that respect too.
[1679.24] You are my wife, that is a truth,
[1682.08] a reality,
[1685.76] you will get the same honor
 and position as Alizeh,
[1690.32] just give me some time,
[1694.40] and trust me during this time,
[1696.84] I am yours.
[1705.36] If I hadn’t promised my Dad,
[1708.56] I would have taken 
you and thrown
[1710.08] you out of my life right
 here, right now.
[1713.12] I feel disgusted in myself
[1714.44] that I chose a girl like you.
[1762.60] Afnan,
[1765.96] you have done wrong 
with my daughter.
[1776.88] I don’t get it myself that what
 is happening with me.
[1789.00] the ground is feeling 
insufficient to me.
[1799.92] Since Dad has left,
[1803.84] all the happiness and ease 
has gone away from my life.
[1818.00] It feels like I have 
just gotten alone.
[1824.76] You are responsible for
 this loneliness too.
[1834.68] I am surprised that
[1837.28] an intelligent man like you,
[1839.56] how can he make such
 a huge mistake.
[1855.76] You married Ramsha.
[1866.28] Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys
[1873.92] who are family-oriented and rich too,
[1876.92] they marry them
[1886.32] and that is what Ramsha did too.
[1898.60] You are honorable, family-oriented
[1900.96] and rich too,
[1908.92] she married you
[1910.80] and defamed you
[1917.52] and then she got famous overnight
[1926.96] because that is what she wanted.
