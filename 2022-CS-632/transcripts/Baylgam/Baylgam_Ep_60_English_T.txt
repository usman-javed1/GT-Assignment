[18.12] What did you say to Ramsha?
[20.92] She complained to you about me.
[22.68] I am asking you what 
you said to Ramsha?
[25.60] it is not possible that
[26.96] she didn’t tell you what 
I said to her.
[30.12] She told me nothing.
[31.88] Really?
[32.80] She didn’t tell you anything
[34.20] and you are getting 
so upset with me.
[36.56] If she had told you something,
[37.64] then God knows what you 
would have done.
[38.76] Don’t change the topic
[41.00] and don’t think useless things,
[42.56] tell me what did you say to her?
[44.56] I didn’t expect this from an 
educated girl like you that
[47.32] the girl who is in this condition,
[48.84] you will treat her like this.
[51.60] I am disappointed Afnan,
[54.16] that you are worried for a stranger’s 
sorrow and pain, instead of your wife.
[59.24] You worry about her.
[61.68] Then you say that I doubt you.
[64.12] For God’s sake,
[65.60] there is nothing between
 me and Ramsha,
[67.60] stop doubting us.
[69.32] Had I known before marriage that
[71.28] you had an affair with her,
[72.32] then I would never
 have married you.
[74.20] I am not mad Afnan,
[76.16] you have created this doubt
 for me in your heart.
[78.80] The hard work and effort
[80.48] you are putting it in doubting 
me and Ramsha,
[83.76] had you put 25% of that effort 
on our relationship,
[86.84] then today, you too wouldn’t
 be in this torture today
[88.60] and my life would
 have been at peace.
[91.72] You are putting in the effort 
at the wrong place,
[94.52] and only the two of us will 
face the consequences of it.
[105.44] I feel you started serving Ramsha as
 soon as you came from the office.
[108.36] You didn’t even change 
your clothes.
[109.80] Yes, I didn’t change.
[111.84] I didn’t get the chance.
[113.48] I found out Ramsha is unwell,
[115.72] so I came here to ask how she is.
[117.60] You are really worried for Ramsha.
[121.84] What do you mean?
 What do you want to say?
[125.08] That you never cared so 
much for me, Afnan.
[128.84] You are not in this condition either.
[131.68] And even if I came and asked her 
how she was in this condition,
[135.16] then no hell broke loose.
[157.12] Thank God, Ramsha didn’t tell 
brother anything.
[160.76] You know the difficulty with which 
brother stopped her from going.
[164.40] She didn’t say anything to uncle,
[166.20] but yes, she complained to
 Afnan about me.
[169.00] That’s why he came to fight with me.
[173.00] I cannot believe this.
[177.80] If Ramsha had to complain,
[180.08] she would have told brother,
[181.60] why Afnan?
[184.12] Then why was he fighting me?
[185.88] Has he gone mad?
[188.20] Afnan has not gone mad, 
you have that you
[190.28] fight with Afnan for no reason.
[197.00] Hey Afnan must have 
guessed and talked.
[200.36] He must have felt that you 
said something to Ramsha,
[203.36] that is why Ramsha is insistent 
on going home.
[213.00] Look Alizay,
[214.56] now I don’t want that brother has 
a complaint from you for no reason.
[218.20] Mama, uncle anyway has 
a complaint from me all the time.
[221.56] Yes, so he should
 also complain.
[223.92] You don’t care about Afnan,
[225.56] nor any responsibility 
of the home,
[227.56] neither do you care about brother.
[233.52] Being the daughter
 in law of this home,
[235.56] what responsibilities 
have you taken up?
[243.24] Hey, it is brother’s greatness that 
he doesn’t say anything to you
[246.60] and he is lenient to you.
[253.20] Look,
[254.52] brother has made Ramsha
 his daughter
[257.28] and Alizay if you 
ask me honestly,
[259.44] then Ramsha has proved 
herself to be his daughter.
[265.32] She really cares for brother.
[269.68] Are you not getting late?
[271.00] Aunt Bina must be waiting for you.
[275.04] I am late,
[276.36] but now I would want that you 
too come along with me.
[279.00] She will be really happy 
when she sees you.
[283.72] Mama, please, I don’t 
want to go anywhere,
[285.40] I am really tired.
[286.48] That’s it.
[287.48] That’s your problem.
[289.68] You only do what you want to.
[296.68] Hey, bring some change in yourself,
[299.04] bring in some flexibility.
[304.80] Okay fine, I will come with you.
[308.52] That’s what I am talking about.
[310.00] Go and get ready.
[322.16] thank God you are much
 better than before.
[324.68] This means you are taking your 
medication on time.
[327.96] You have guessed it right.
[329.08] The credit of this goes to Ramsha.
[333.36] She has got me in the habit of
 taking my medication regularly.
[340.76] When the child comes home,
[342.24] I am at peace.
[343.04] May God give her a good fate.
[345.52] May He bless her with faith, 
health and good health.
[351.64] Dad I need to take this call.
[353.16] Yes, close the door and 
switch off the light.
[355.92] I too will rest a little.
[357.20] Yes.
[362.88] Goodnight.
[363.64] Goodnight.
[378.68] Hello.
[380.44] Greetings.
[381.88] Greetings. Who?
[383.80] This is Annie, Ramsha’s cousin.
[390.24] I think you are Afnan.
[392.52] Yes, yes, this is Afnan.
[394.00] You tell me, all okay?
[396.44] I want to talk to Ramsha.
[399.60] Actually, I have been calling 
her for a long time, but
[402.12] I think her number is off.
[406.96] It is her birthday today,
[408.48] I want to wish her. 
Will you let me talk to her?
[412.80] Today is Ramsha’s birthday.
[415.32] yes, is it 12 am, and
[418.80] from the start I used to wish her first.
[425.56] So let me talk to her.
[428.44] Yes, yes, I will make you 
talk to her immediately,
[430.32] but before that can you 
agree to something?
[466.92] Where were you Shani?
[468.36] I called out to you so many times.
[469.32] The tea even got cold,
[470.32] I have heated it again.
[471.32] What were you doing?
[472.36] Mama, I don’t understand.
[473.48] Since Ramsha went, I am 
unable to find my things.
[476.08] It doesn’t take me so long
 to get ready,that
[477.96] it takes me to find the things.
[479.60] See,
[480.88] when Ramsha was there,
[481.92] she would keep everything 
safely and in its place,
[485.32] and you?
[486.40] You just throw things around,
[487.68] if you look for them, 
how will you find out.
[490.04] Mama, you know you are right.
[492.44] If she was there, then 
I had no such tension.
[494.00] mama. Mama.
[495.64] Yes?
[496.20] Mr. Qasim is calling.
[498.36] Mr. Qasim?
[499.08] On my phone.
[501.56] Answer it.
[502.68] He didn’t tell me anything,
[504.32] he is just telling me to
 let him talk to you.
[509.60] Hello.
[524.68] Tabassum.
[527.96] Tabassum.
[530.08] Where is everyone?
[557.00] Surprise.
[559.20] Happy birthday to you.
[561.84] Happy birthday to you.
[565.08] Happy birthday dear Ramsha.
[568.68] Happy birthday to you.
[571.68] Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you so much.
[573.48] What is all this?
[574.96] You people scared me.
[576.76] Brother Shani did all this.
[578.68] Yes, but it was her idea.
[586.32] Wow. But when did
 you people plan this?
[590.88] Uncle Qasim called,
[592.44] he said he wants to
 celebrate your birthday.
[595.56] And along with it,
 we will have a get together
[597.48] and spend good time together.
[602.76] You did good that 
you people came.
[606.28] I was really missing you all.
[611.24] Brother has decorated it so well
[613.12] and uncle Qasim really
 loves you like a daughter.
[617.52] See ,he did so much for you.
[620.12] Yes, uncle really loves me a lot.
[630.96] I think we should cut the cake now.
[634.04] Yes, Afnan, aunt and
 Alizay are not here.
[637.72] If they were with us, 
we would have had fun.
[638.96] Please, call them.
[642.68] Yes, I too wanted this but
[644.16] I called them a lot,
[645.92] none of them is answering it.
[650.52] I think they are in a gathering.
[652.88] I will call again.
[654.12] Fine, try again.
[655.76] If they are here, 
it will look nice.
[657.68] Yes, you people enjoy.
[659.96] Okay tell me, how did you 
like the surprise?
[824.08] you look really happy.
[826.52] Yes, Alizay,
[827.88] I am happy.
[829.44] You see,
[830.84] everyone has done 
so much for me.
[833.56] Seeing this I realize everyone 
really loves me a lot.
[840.96] I don’t know about everyone,
[842.60] but yes, Afnan really loves you a lot.
[849.60] Alizay,
[852.40] what nonsense is this?
[854.04] Is this something you
 should be saying?
[858.96] I am so sorry, Ramsha.
[863.16] You know Alizay well,
[865.60] she speaks without thinking.
[867.88] What is so wrong
 in what I said?
[869.76] I am right.
[873.48] All this is your love that 
we see here today.
[876.08] Stop it Alizay.
[878.52] If you say another word, 
it will not be good. Be quiet.
[885.48] You are making me be quiet?
[887.48] I am not mad.
[889.12] I can see everything clearly,
[891.44] I am your wife.
[892.80] I understand the drama going 
on between you two here.
[895.72] What do you think?
[896.64] I cannot see.
[898.04] Is she your wife that you 
are creating this drama?
[900.28] Alizay.
[900.72] Afnan.
[910.92] What are you doing?
[916.16] You were going to raise 
your hand at me?
[919.28] Hit me, why did you stop?
[921.72] You were going to raise your 
hand at me for this girl?
[924.72] What is going on?
[929.60] Mama.
[932.20] Mama.
[933.20] Mama. Afnan was 
raising his hand at me.
[939.60] Afnan…
[942.16] what is this I hear?
[945.84] Aunt, I can explain this to you.
[948.56] Alizay was misbehaving a lot,
[950.08] I did raise my hand,
[951.36] but I didn’t hit her.
[952.44] Afnan, don’t fool everyone here.
[955.48] I am your wife, I understand 
what you are doing.
[962.44] Alizay, enough.
[964.64] Enough. Please
 don’t create a scene.
[966.80] I created a scene? 
What is all this?
[972.04] Stop it Alizay.
[973.52] Don’t create a scene.
[976.08] Come to the room, we will talk.
[978.32] I don’t want to talk to
 him about anything.
[979.84] I saw everything with my eyes.
[1004.96] Dad, you are scolding
 me for no reason.
[1006.88] Although, it is all Alizay’s fault.
[1009.12] Whatever it is,
[1010.24] you shouldn’t raise your 
hand at her.
[1011.56] I didn’t raise my hand at her, dad.
[1013.84] If she is saying this, then 
she is lying to you.
[1015.88] Lower your voice with me.
[1018.56] Okay dad, I am really sorry,
[1020.36] I raised my voice,
[1021.56] but I am getting frustrated.
[1023.52] Every time, Alizay 
complains about me
[1025.36] and you start scolding me.
[1027.28] Although, it is all her fault, 
it is always her mistake.
[1030.00] Look, if you had a complaint 
from Alizay,
[1031.84] you should have said it to me.
[1032.96] How could I say it, dad?
[1034.24] I will talk when she gives 
me a chance to talk.
[1037.08] You don’t know what dirty things 
she said about me and Ramsha.
[1041.76] It was my courage 
that I tolerated it.
[1044.44] If you were there in
 my place dad,
[1046.08] then you wouldn’t have 
been able to tolerate it.
[1047.52] You would have slapped her.
[1050.36] You are not trusting me,
[1052.40] I am tired of making
 everyone understand.
[1054.88] I don’t know what is going
 on in this home.
[1069.84] Now like the rest, you too 
please don’t scold me.
[1072.88] After all, the entire 
family thinks that
[1075.00] I am wrong in everything.
[1076.96] You are not wrong,
[1079.00] but your method is wrong.
[1085.96] If Alizay doesn’t like you 
doing anything for me,
[1089.52] then why are you doing it?
[1092.56] She said so much to you and
[1094.60] you are taking her side.
[1097.12] I am not taking her side,
[1098.52] I am just supporting what is the truth.
[1101.96] and what is right?
[1103.56] Please also tell me,
[1104.88] because I don’t know.
[1107.72] Alizay is your wife, Afnan.
[1110.80] She has the most right on you.
[1117.92] Her likes and dislikes are things you will
 have to be careful about.
[1122.16] If she doesn’t like you 
doing anything for me,
[1124.56] then don’t do anything.
[1131.52] If I was in Alizay’s place,
[1133.40] I too would have had
 the same reacting.
[1135.72] If you were in her place, then this 
would never have happened.
[1142.44] Because you are not selfish like her,
[1146.64] you are not envious.
[1149.76] You are not jealous of the 
happiness of others
[1153.00] Believe me,
[1154.76] Alizay started this drama because
[1156.96] she is jealous of your happiness.
[1164.88] She is jealous of you,
[1167.12] and when a person is 
jealous of someone,
[1169.52] then they are not able to differentiate
 between right and wrong.
[1177.60] You don’t need to make me understand,
 you need to make her understand.
[1180.52] Who forced her to be jealous?
[1186.48] Are you serious?
[1188.64] I can’t believe this.
[1191.44] I heard so much from
 Alizay because of you
[1193.92] and now you are blaming me?
[1199.20] And there Alizay too is blaming me.
[1202.04] I am surprised.
[1203.64] You cannot do good nowadays.
[1271.92] Ramsha? Hello.
[1274.88] Greetings.
[1276.08] Greetings. How are you?
[1281.04] Shani, can you come right now?
[1284.84] At this hour?
[1286.84] Yes.
[1288.92] Ramsha, when I was 
leaving home from today,
[1291.40] I asked you to come along,
[1293.68] you said no.
[1295.28] and now you are suddenly
 saying right now
[1296.36] that I come to pick you.
[1298.36] Yes, but you just come, Shani.
[1302.68] Why?
[1304.44] Do you miss me?
[1308.84] Do you miss me?
[1312.28] And you are not able to
 focus without me?
[1315.08] Shani, please come.
[1316.44] I want to go home.
[1318.40] Hey, how can I come at this hour.
[1321.48] I mean, I cannot come to pick 
you up on the bike,
[1324.08] it is really late at night.
[1325.48] I will come in the morning.
[1327.04] No, no,
[1328.40] you try and come to get me
 right now somehow.
[1333.52] Fine, if I find a car or taxi,
[1337.32] then I will come to pick you up. 
And I will tell you.
[1344.12] But I cannot take you home 
on the bike at night like this.
[1348.16] I will tell you.
[1350.48] Okay, goodbye.
[1352.08] Goodbye.
[1356.32] What is the emergency right now?
[1373.12] Shani, you have a seat. 
I will bring my bag.
[1376.04] Come quickly,
[1377.08] the taxi is waiting outside.
[1378.40] Fine.
[1392.04] Greetings.
[1394.16] Greetings.
[1396.80] I came to pick up Ramsha.
[1399.12] See, at that time I was asking
 her to come along,
[1401.44] she didn’t come then.
[1402.96] Now she is suddenly saying 
that I come get her.
[1405.24] That’s why I came.
[1407.88] I think Ramsha didn’t 
tell you anything.
[1411.16] About what?
[1413.84] That why is she leaving from 
this home at this time.
[1417.08] What do you mean? 
Why is she going?
[1420.52] Meaning,
[1422.00] I don’t want that she stays in this home
 even for one second.
[1428.56] I don’t understand 
why are you saying this?
[1431.36] What has happened?
[1433.60] Look,
[1434.96] no matter how independent 
a woman becomes,
[1438.44] as a wife she cannot tolerate that
[1442.36] her husband’s ex-lover 
stays in front of her.
[1453.84] Why are you looking at me like
 you don’t know anything?
[1460.36] Your wife was my husband’s ex-lover.
[1484.28] What nonsense is this?
[1489.32] This is not the way.
 Please don’t say that.
[1494.48] Talk with me with respect.
[1495.84] And put your finger
 down when talking.
[1497.80] I am telling you the truth, 
that you don’t know.
[1527.68] You know,
[1528.60] I was waiting for you for a long time.
[1530.16] Why did you take so long?
[1533.00] Did you not find a car that is
 why you got late?
[1541.52] Whose car is this?
[1543.20] Did you bring it from that friend 
of yours about whom you…
[1545.56] Can you not sit quietly?
[1549.08] What is wrong, Shani?
[1550.36] Why are you talking like this?
[1557.32] Why are you in a bad mood?
[1562.96] Did something happen at home?
[1603.76] Look, no matter how independent 
a woman becomes,
[1608.44] as a wife she cannot tolerate that
[1612.16] her husband’s ex-lover 
stays in front of her.
[1630.80] Why are you looking at me like
 you don’t know anything?
[1634.28] Your wife was my husband’s ex-lover.
[1641.80] What nonsense is this?
[1644.68] This is not the way.
[1647.08] Please don’t say that.
[1649.76] Talk with me with respect.
[1651.36] And put your finger down when talking.
[1653.28] I am telling you the truth, 
that you don’t know.
[1663.96] What happened, Shani?
[1665.68] You are quiet since you came.
[1672.12] You are angry, right?
[1674.04] I disturbed you so late at night,
[1677.44] you sleep got disturbed too.
[1679.96] That is why you are angry at me. Right?
[1685.08] You are asking me?
[1690.16] Shameless, immodest, disrespectful.
[1693.12] What is wrong, Shani?
[1694.36] Talk to me with respect.
[1695.64] What are you angry about?
[1696.92] What am I angry about?
[1698.12] I am angry that I am not 
shameless like you.
[1700.76] Do you understand?
[1730.44] Oh God, what noise is this?
[1733.76] It is coming from Shani’s room.
[1738.16] Anwar.
[1739.24] Yes.
[1739.72] Anwar, wake up.
[1741.00] Wake up, quickly.
[1742.76] Why are you waking me up at this hour?
[1745.04] What happened?
[1745.92] Hear the noise.
[1747.68] It is coming from Shani’s room.
[1749.16] They are fighting again.
[1750.08] I can even hear the sound of things falling.
[1753.12] They are fighting again.
[1756.32] Shani, leave me, it hurts.
[1758.48] Listen.
[1759.16] Shani.
[1764.24] Get up and check.
[1765.76] Okay.
[1768.80] This is a daily occurrence.
[1772.40] What are you doing?
 What has happened?
[1774.32] I should give you a medal, right?
[1776.72] Shani, what has happened?
[1779.16] Shani. What is this?
[1780.60] what is going on?
[1782.12] what is this noise about?
[1782.96] What is this?
[1785.36] You are a cheater.
[1786.68] You cheated me,
 you cheated all of us.
[1796.28] What?
[1797.08] What is all this? 
What is this noise?
[1798.72] What is happening?
[1799.84] Being someone else’s lover, 
she married me.
[1813.76] Hey you should have married him.
[1816.00] What nonsense is this?
[1817.68] Are you in your senses?
[1819.44] What?
[1820.08] Who are you talking about? Who?
[1821.68] I am talking about Afnan, who else?
[1832.96] Afnan?
[1833.84] What nonsense is this?
[1847.04] If you don’t believe me,
[1849.08] then ask her.
[1850.48] She too is involved equally 
in all this. Ask her.
[1853.72] Why are you quiet?
[1855.12] Answer now.
[1856.08] Tell them.
[1857.00] What is this? I will not leave her…
[1858.36] Shani, remain in your senses.
[1859.68] Papa, you stop it.
[1861.40] You don’t speak in this matter.
[1866.52] The women of your home are
 getting disrespected everywhere,
[1869.56] we are not able to face anyone.
[1882.20] And Alizay told me this.
[1889.36] And you think what 
I would have gone through.
[1891.36] I wanted to die right there.
[1901.40] Ramsha,
[1904.28] what is all this?
[1905.28] What is he saying? Tell us.
[1911.88] Tell us the truth, what is the matter?
[1913.44] Mama, why are you asking her the truth.
[1915.00] Ask me, if you want to know the truth.
[1917.88] I will tell her if you have the courage.
[1933.08] I will kill her alive.
[1934.28] Shani, come your senses.
[1935.28] Leave me. I am in my senses papa.
[1939.36] I am in my senses.
[1941.84] Now all of you will see 
what I do to her.
[1943.84] Come with me.
[1944.56] Leave me.
[1945.92] Come on, come with me.
[1946.40] I will not leave you.
[1946.88] Listen to me.
[1981.16] You know Alizay well,
[1983.56] she speaks without thinking.
[1985.72] What is so wrong in what I said?
[1987.68] I am right.
[1991.28] All this is your love that 
we see here today.
[1994.00] Stop it Alizay.
[1996.28] If you say another word, 
it will not be good. Be quiet.
[2003.44] You are making me be quiet?
[2005.36] I am not mad.
[2007.00] I can see everything clearly,
[2009.28] I am your wife.
[2010.64] I understand the drama going on 
between you two here.
[2013.56] What do you think?
[2014.60] I cannot see.
[2015.80] Is she your wife that you are 
creating this drama?
[2018.12] Alizay.
[2018.60] Afnan.
[2125.04] Child, stop it. Don’t cry like this.
 Come on,
[2130.56] don’t cry like this.
[2132.72] It is not good for 
your child’s health.
[2135.44] You can get unwell as well.
[2139.00] You don’t worry, I will talk to Shani.
[2142.16] I don’t know what happened
 to that boy suddenly.
[2145.24] Okay, don’t cry. Give her water.
[2147.64] Drink some water. Come on.
[2149.40] no.
[2149.80] Have a little.
[2154.24] Annie,
[2155.20] you sleep with your sister tonight.
[2157.96] Yes.
[2158.48] and take lots of care of Ramsha.
[2161.36] God forbid if she gets unwell or
[2163.64] if you feel she is unwell
[2165.44] then tell me immediately. Okay?
[2172.12] Come on, now close your 
eyes and try to sleep.
[2174.52] Switch off the light. Come on.
[2185.76] Please, don’t cry Ramsha.
[2187.88] I have never seen 
you crying so badly.
[2191.60] I cannot see you like this, 
Ramsha.
[2194.68] I know you did nothing.
[2197.20] You are really good Ramsha,
[2198.60] you didn’t commit a sin.
[2201.12] You know.
[2202.84] You know, I have 
not done anything wrong,
[2205.44] You know everything about
 me and Afnan, Annie.
[2208.56] We did nothing wrong.
[2210.52] I didn’t do anything wrong.
[2211.96] I am not bad, Annie.
[2213.88] No, you are not a bad girl at all,
[2215.20] you are a really good girl, Ramsha.
[2217.04] Mama is there. Mama
 will talk to brother.
[2219.52] Everything will be fine.
 Everything will be fine.
