[21.64] No, no, Mr. Afnan,
[23.44] you are understanding wrong,
there is nothing like that.
[26.64] Please, whatever you are doing 
with her is wrong.
[29.16] I am doing wrong?
[35.80] Shani, I don’t want to hear
 anything from you.
[47.08] It would be better that you leave 
from here right now.
[52.32] You are doing wrong with her.
[54.36] Don’t do that.
[60.00] I don’t believe it that you are saying 
this to me, Shani.
[71.64] I am doing wrong with Ramsha?
[80.68] What do you know what misunderstanding 
has developed between us?
[93.32] And you did wrong with her.
[110.12] Did you forget?
[113.40] You were so unjust and cruel 
to Ramsha.
[125.96] How can you come here today 
and tell me,
[128.20] I am doing wrong with her,
[131.20] when you don’t know anything.
[135.88] You are right.
[147.04] I am getting punished for what 
I did with her and I am regretting it.
[160.40] But I want that you don’t make 
the mistake I made.
[170.56] Even I am regretting, Shani.
[182.68] I am regretting loving Ramsha.
[195.96] I am regretting that 
I always protected her.
[209.04] I am regretting making her my respect
and bringing her to this home.
[226.44] But what did I get in return
for my love?
[235.96] Only regret.
[247.84] As far as you are concerned,
[251.80] if you are regretting so much
[256.16] and you have this wish in 
any corner of your home,
[261.00] then maybe I will leave Ramsha 
and she will come back to you,
[265.00] then forget about it, Shani.
[277.12] I still love Ramsha the same,
[287.56] as I sued to when you 
used to torture her.
[301.44] So, no matter what happens,
[305.76] I will not leave Ramsha.
[318.20] It would be better that 
you leave from here.
[321.16] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything.
[410.60] Did someone come to meet you 
in the academy today?
[414.00] No. why?
[416.76] I was thinking that your relatives 
don’t come to meet you at home,
[422.76] so I was thinking some relative of yours
came to meet you at the academy.
[430.64] No one came to meet me 
at the academy, Afnan.
[434.44] After all,
[436.08] I have no one in the world,
[439.56] so it doesn’t matter to me 
if someone is there or not.
[446.12] Yes, I am talking about Ramsha.
[448.24] What were you talking to her about?
[450.04] Who are you to ask me this?
[452.32] She is my friend.
[454.72] I can talk to her about what I want.
[457.40] What?
[458.88] She is your friend? 
She is your friend?
[460.48] She is more than a friend.
[465.32] Why do I tell you?
[470.20] Mind your own business. 
Understand?
[476.88] Yes, I have called on her number 
several times since morning,
[480.12] but her number is off.
[482.32] I don’t know where she went.
[484.00] She ran away with her lover.
[485.92] Be quiet!
[494.96] You know I am surprised and 
I am a little sad for you too.
[506.60] On the fact that I felt that 
maybe you are her only lover.
[517.64] But there are more here.
[526.20] Afnan, what is all this?
[529.24] If Ramsha wants to leave this home,
then let her go.
[533.92] Why have you disturbed yourself 
and this home because of her?
[544.32] Afnan, don’t you see?
[546.52] Since that girl came to this home, 
nothing is right.
[555.16] I would say,
[556.92] drag her out of this home.
[574.44] You married, Ramsha?
[577.48] Girls like Ramsha look for decent boys,
[580.48] who are not only from a good family, 
but also rich.
[583.44] They marry them.
[589.08] And that’s what Ramsha did.
[596.48] You are a decent man, 
from a good family and rich.
[603.40] Marrying you, she defamed you,
[610.04] and she became famous overnight.
[613.08] After all,
[615.12] you are not the first man 
in Ramsha’s life.
[724.16] Shani?
[725.60] What is he doing here?
[745.64] Greetings.
[747.88] I knew you would surely call, Afnan.
[751.48] Yes, obviously,
[753.00] I had to call. 
Your actions are such.
[756.24] What do you mean? 
What have I done?
[760.40] What do you think? I don’t understand
your cunningness.
[769.76] You convinced your ex-husband to come
 to my home and speak in my favour.
[777.68] What are you saying?
[780.40] I don’t understand anything, Afnan.
[783.20] You are really cunning.
[791.88] Don’t act like you are innocent 
in front of me.
[801.84] Shani came here.
[811.92] He came to my home to speak 
in your favour.
[815.20] No Afnan, there is nothing like that.
[823.88] I didn’t tell anyone anything, 
nor did I send anyone.
[832.80] You have a misunderstanding.
[839.24] If Shani came there,
[841.36] then I have no idea of this, Afnan.
[844.68] Really?
[846.24] So you think that I will believe it
[848.64] that you didn’t cry about your 
helplessness in front of Shani.
[859.40] You didn’t tell him the stories of our home,
you didn’t tell him about me?
[869.88] If you didn’t mention it to him, 
then did he have a divine revelation?
[878.52] How did he find out that I got upset
and left you there?
[881.92] I don’t know how Shani found out,
 Afnan.
[892.60] I didn’t tell anyone about our fight.
[903.28] Neither does aunt know anything, 
nor Annie.
[912.48] So why would I tell Shani?
[916.80] I don’t know what game 
you are playing, Ramsha.
[927.80] I just know that
[930.92] I feel sorry for my fate today.
[939.80] I trusted your false love.
[952.00] I thought that maybe you love me,
but no, all that was a lie,
[955.76] a deceit.
[963.28] It was just word play.
[971.92] I wish this real face of yours had come
in front of me a long time back.
[984.88] I wouldn’t have made a lot of mistakes.
[994.96] Anyway, I don’t want to talk to you.
[1004.88] Don’t call me after today.
[1008.16] Bye.
[1010.92] Hello.
[1011.80] Afnan. Afnan.
[1043.60] What can lying and hypocritical 
people like you do apart from this?
[1048.08] Enough.
[1050.36] You have said enough.
[1054.08] And they are not making up stories,
 you are.
[1058.20] You are telling a fake story 
like always.
[1061.84] What was the need for you 
to do all this, Ramsha?
[1065.64] I have had enough, there is no place
 for you in this home.
[1067.76] Get lost from here.
[1074.96] I am not interested in speaking
 in the matters of your life.
[1078.88] But when do you know 
how to live your life?
[1083.00] How do you know how to 
take right decisions?
[1086.72] If you had taken the right decisions,
[1090.12] then today my father would 
have been alive.
[1093.80] You killed my father.
[1097.24] Hey, if you had lived your life properly,
[1099.92] you wouldn’t have been here today, 
you would have been at your home.
[1103.00] Today, my father would have been alive.
[1106.32] And I wouldn’t hate you so much today.
[1134.08] This Shani will not let go of my life.
[1190.88] Why did you go to Afnan?
[1193.88] I am asking you something, 
why did you go to Afnan, Shani?
[1199.56] I went to make him understand?
[1201.72] You went to make him understand?
[1208.88] Shani, have you lost your mind?
[1211.08] You first understand yourself, 
then you make others understand.
[1214.28] The one who needs to understand 
something the most in the world is you.
[1220.48] Ramsha, I cannot see you crying.
[1231.40] You were crying last night.
[1239.00] I didn’t like it, so I thought
[1241.40] I would go and talk to Afnan, 
I will make him understand.
[1244.12] Whatever misunderstandings 
you both have, to remove them.
[1249.00] Do you have any shame, Shani?
[1256.84] Now you were listening to me 
and Afnan talk secretly?
[1264.52] And since when did you start 
worrying about my tears, Shani?
[1269.36] You didn’t care for my tears, 
when you were supposed to care.
[1275.52] For God’s sake,
[1277.72] leave me alone.
[1279.56] Don’t ruin my life.
[1281.96] I just want to see you happy.
[1283.68] Stop it.
[1285.96] The further you stay from me, 
the happier I will be.
[1295.60] Whatever was there between me 
and Afnan, Shani,
[1298.52] you have made a mountain 
out of that mole hill.
[1305.52] For God’s sake, 
get away from my life,
[1309.08] let me live in peace.
[1312.44] Ramsha, what is the matter?
[1316.08] Why are you getting 
so upset with him?
[1317.72] Ask this from your son, aunt.
[1328.68] Ask him, why is he not letting me
live in peace?
[1331.60] Why does he want to ruin my life?
[1341.52] What does he have to do in the matters
between me and Afnan?
[1344.24] Why is he interfering?
[1356.96] Do you know? He went to Afnan.
[1369.92] Afnan is thinking that I sent him to 
Afnan that go and clarify things for me.
[1376.40] Shani, you went to Mr. Qasim’s home?
[1386.72] When did you go?
[1389.32] And you had told me that 
you are going to the shop.
[1396.64] I am asking you something.
[1430.12] The day Ramsha left from your life 
and this home,
[1434.32] the happiness has left this home.
[1438.88] At times, I am sure that
[1443.20] we have really hurt Ramsha.
[1446.72] Annie, what are you saying?
[1449.08] Ramsha was a really good girl.
[1453.96] She had changed herself 
for the will of God.
[1457.76] She became sincere to you, 
she started loving you,
[1463.16] but you didn’t care for her.
[1467.88] This world is place of karma, brother.
[1479.28] Why did you not feel embarrassed
[1482.56] when you made fun of my helplessness, 
Shani.
[1486.52] You even snatched the roof 
from my home.
[1488.96] Along with your life you dragged me 
out of this home.
[1492.72] Why did you not feel embarrassed then?
[1497.92] I forgive you, Shani.
[1504.00] I didn’t forgive you because 
my heart became soft,
[1510.84] in fact, I forgave you because
[1513.08] I don’t want to keep any relation 
with a man like you.
[1518.88] Neither of hatred,
[1521.96] nor of revenge.
[1537.08] Yes, yes, I have authorized the cheque,
you can deposit it.
[1541.40] Thank you so much. 
Thank you.
[1543.92] Afnan, why did Shani come?
[1559.08] Shani?
[1560.88] Who told you Shani came here?
[1563.28] Hey, I saw him leaving from 
the home myself.
[1573.32] Did something happen?
[1577.08] Yes, Shani came. I forgot.
[1580.24] Shani is setting up a new shop.
[1589.64] So, he came to discuss something 
related to that.
[1593.80] Okay, okay, I thought he just came 
to drop Ramsha with his mother.
[1606.72] By the way, where is Ramsha? 
Why has she not come till now?
[1617.48] Till when will she come?
[1619.60] Her uncle is really unwell.
[1623.00] I don’t think she will come back 
till he gets fine.
[1632.48] Excuse me.
[1634.32] Hello.
[1642.80] I don’t understand anything.
[1645.84] What do I do with this boy?
[1652.36] All his life he has done 
what he wanted.
[1662.56] He didn’t agree to anything I said.
[1671.56] You tell me,
[1673.56] what was the need for him to 
go to Afnan’s home like this?
[1677.64] What was the need?
[1683.80] Call him.
[1685.52] I will hit him two to four times, 
then he will understand.
[1690.16] Anwar, leave it.
[1698.44] If you see him in front of you, 
you will get upset further.
[1705.28] Your blood pressure is high anyway.
[1715.68] You know, I have scolded Shani badly
[1719.32] and I have also apologized to 
Ramsha for Shani’s behaviour.
[1731.00] Poor Ramsha was so worried.
[1733.92] Was this something 
he should have done?
[1743.12] He is a weird emotional boy.
[1745.08] He doesn’t think or understand anything.
He went there for no reason.
[1750.12] He shouldn’t have gone there 
at any cost.
[1758.88] He should remember
[1760.80] that not only is he Ramsha’s cousin,
but he is also her ex-husband.
[1771.52] How did he go to meet Afnan?
[1775.24] You know,
[1776.52] poor Ramsha was really worried, 
she was crying.
[1787.88] Anwar, she was really worried. 
Now see,
[1790.96] one mistake of this boy,
[1793.56] one stupidity of is making everyone 
suffer. Everyone is worried.
[1806.68] And the people with Annie’s proposal
wanted to come over.
[1812.52] Now you tell me, 
we have this issue here,
[1816.36] Ramsha is sitting at home.
[1818.36] How do I call the people 
with the proposal home?
[1823.28] You just do one thing.
[1825.88] You make an excuse and 
avoid them.
[1835.96] Them coming over here till 
Ramsha is here is not right.
[1842.28] Once Ramsha leaves, 
we will see.
[1847.72] Fine.
[1849.76] These people have me worried.
[1866.72] Alizeh, whether you accept it or not,
[1869.08] Afnan is surely hiding something.
[1871.56] I saw Shani leave from here, 
and he was also angry.
[1876.04] He had no colour on his face.
[1878.48] Something is surely fishy.
[1881.60] Mama, I too feel that 
something has happened.
[1886.00] I had to go to the office today, or else 
I would have overheard something.
[1889.72] And this Afnan won’t tell us anything.
[1891.92] Obviously, why would he tell us?
[1894.52] He knows if he says anything,
[1897.00] we will say things to him instead.
[1900.72] Mama, you call Ramsha and find out,
[1903.88] you will surely find out something.
[1905.76] In fact, her uncle was unwell,
[1909.40] you ask about his health and 
then try to talk further.
[1912.92] Yes, that can be done.
