[19.72] I don’t understand
[23.00] that by what relation can Mr Qasim 
keep Ramsha in his house?
[33.24] What is she to her? 
What is their relationship?
[38.04] Ramsha was telling that 
he has made her his daughter.
[41.88] Enough, enough, enough,
[44.60] you let it be,
[51.08] no one becomes a daughter just 
by saying it,
[59.72] the situation is not like that nowadays,
[62.84] we don’t know about a person’s 
intentions.
[70.12] The environment of Mr. Qasim’s house
 and his intentions
[74.48] are way better than this house.
[78.60] What?
[86.40] What are you trying to say?
[89.60] What do you mean? Yeah?
[95.64] I don’t mean anything,
[98.56] I am just trying to say that 
the world knows Mr. Qasim,
[103.36] he is a religious man
[106.12] and Ramsha was praising him 
a lot as well
[109.96] and you used to praise him 
yourself too.
[116.88] Do you remember
[118.92] how he helped Brother Sajid at the time 
of Ramsha’s wedding?
[125.04] How can anyone doubt on such
a kind-hearted person?
[129.52] What is so difficult in fooling the world?
[141.44] What do we know what is 
in a person’s heart?
[148.12] They are something else on the face
 and something else behind the back.
[156.52] I will talk to Mr. Qasim myself now
[166.88] and I will ask him what is his 
relationship with Ramsha.
[178.16] Whose call is it?
[181.24] He has a long life, it is Mr. Qasim.
[188.32] Greetings Mr. Qasim.
[196.52] Yes, yes, thank God.
[200.84] Okay.
[208.28] Umm,
[210.08] okay
[211.44] okay I will let you know.
[216.80] Yes, yes, right, right. Bye.
[222.28] What was he saying?
[224.84] He has asked me and you
[235.40] to come to his home.
[304.04] Come, son, let’s go.
[306.36] Go where? Where is Ramsha?
[308.64] She won’t come with us.
[310.48] What do you mean she won’t 
come with us?
[312.08] The way your dad has treated her,
[315.60] she is not ready to go to that house at all now.
[322.32] And by the way sister-in-law was 
with her earlier
[324.60] but now she is all alone and
 it is better for her.
[333.20] And anyways she is happy and 
satisfied in this house
[336.40] and she is safe too.
[349.84] Mom and dad has sat back quietly,
[353.76] it doesn't make any difference to me 
whether Ramsha comes home or not
[357.04] but now people will get another chance 
to make fun of us
[369.72] when people will find out that 
Ramsha was living with strangers,
[373.12] they will call us shameless.
[377.48] Mom, herself is home all day
and dad is at the shop,
[381.40] I have to face people
[384.56] but I won’t let people make 
fun of me now,
[388.08] my name is Shani and 
I don’t give up very easily,
[392.76] what needs to be done this time,
 it will only be my decision,
[397.68] just my decision.
[420.04] Ramsha?
[422.68] Ramsha?
[428.16] what is this way of coming 
to someone’s home?
[430.36] And why are you shouting?
[433.60] Call Ramsha, she will go with me.
[435.80] Behave, this is my home, 
not yours.
[440.80] Ramsha?
[448.28] Ramsha?
[450.88] Ramsha?
[455.92] You?
[464.32] Why have you come here?
[466.28] Come with me, right now, 
come, let’s go home.
[473.24] I’ll not go with you anywhere.
[483.56] I have already informed aunt, 
so you may leave.
[486.36] Ramsha, don’t act stubborn, 
you will come with me right now.
[494.56] I told you to stop arguing,
[497.00] I don’t want to go anywhere 
with you, leave.
[499.88] I will see how you wouldn’t go
 from here.
[501.60] Shani, what are you doing? 
Leave my hand, it is hurting.
[504.24] I am telling you I won’t come 
with you so I won’t.
[506.12] You will come with me.
[507.56] Shani, leave my hand. 
What is all this going on?
[511.72] I am here to take her; 
she will come with me.
[513.96] First leave her hand, leave her 
hand and talk to me.
[523.32] I used to consider you a noble son 
of a noble father
[526.68] but the way you are acting like 
a goon inside my home,
[529.92] it shows your character and 
how your father has raised you as well.
[550.32] I am here to take her; 
she will come with me.
[566.88] Look I didn’t call you;
[569.64] I called your parents; 
Ramsha won’t go with you.
[573.44] she is my fiancé
[591.88] and she will go with me, 
no one can stop her,
[594.04] not even you.
[604.28] No, no, uncle he is lying, we never 
had any engagement.
[617.16] We were said to be married but 
mom called it off while she was alive,
[620.40] he is lying, go away from here.
[622.80] Did you hear that?
[625.84] You have to come with me, 
right now, do you understand?
[634.60] I am not shameless like you
[636.08] that I should leave you on others 
and go away from here.
[653.32] Will you come with me or 
should I drag you from here?
[655.48] Son?
[657.32] I guess you don’t understand
[659.04] that I told you Ramsha won’t come with you.
[668.40] And Mr. Qasim, even I told you
[671.12] that she will come with me right now.
[686.08] What do you want? Would you leave 
on your own or should I call the guards?
[691.64] What you are doing is wrong
[703.64] but remember one thing,
[706.52] I will file a case against you
[720.96] for kidnapping her and murdering aunt.
[733.88] for now, leave,
[736.36] and do whatever you feel like, hmm?
[741.28] Don’t take me easy. 
Out.
[760.48] Brother, what is this behavior,
[762.60] after all, how many scenes will be created 
in this house because of this girl?
[776.52] I will suggest you go and 
tell the guards
[779.16] that if anyone comes to meet this girl,
[781.52] just throw them out of this house.
[790.04] There is a limit!
[835.00] You give me your address;
[842.48] I will drop you there.
[845.00] Where do you live? 
Where do you reside?
[855.56] Umm, actually, umm,
[861.16] I don’t have anyone in this world 
except my mother.
[866.64] I mean any relative or acquaintance, 
uncle or aunt, etc? Anyone?
[876.52] No one.
[911.96] That is why I don’t want to go there,
[914.56] whatever has happened is in front of you,
[917.52] I wanted to tell you all this earlier, uncle,
[921.60] but I didn’t have the courage to,
[923.76] I and mom were helpless so we didn't have 
any other option except leaving that place.
[932.64] Everything is in front of you uncle,
[936.76] I don’t want to go back to that house.
[948.16] Just imagine Uncle,
[950.60] where I wasn’t safe in the presence 
of Mom,
[958.40] how unsafe I would be there 
without Mom and Dad.
[968.04] I am scared, I don’t want to go there.
[974.04] The ones who have been unjust to you 
should be scared.
[984.32] I think
[986.64] about how many rewards have God kept 
for a good attitude towards other people,
[999.16] and we are such fools,
[1001.88] instead of trading with God,
[1004.52] we ruin our life and hereafter just 
because of money.
[1018.40] Anyway,
[1020.48] don’t worry,
[1022.80] I am with you my child, and 
you don’t have to worry at all
[1026.44] and no one will take you 
out of this house.
[1034.04] Look,
[1035.56] had you told me this earlier,
[1038.68] you wouldn’t have to go through 
this problem.
[1041.52] I wanted to tell you
[1044.56] but uncle, I didn’t have the courage.
[1054.12] I felt that if I tell you everything and 
you don’t believe me,
[1059.68] what will happen to me?
[1064.76] Anyway, you don’t have 
to be scared now
[1067.40] and don’t worry, okay?
[1076.00] May God make the right decision.
[1082.24] Uncle?
[1083.76] Yes, my child?
[1086.84] There is a burden on my heart and
I want to get rid of it.
[1093.28] What burden?
[1095.80] I promised you, right, that 
I won’t hide anything from you?
[1099.00] Yes, yes, I know.
[1103.24] There is a lot that you don’t know.
[1110.48] You carry on tell me what 
you are trying to say.
[1213.64] What is Ramsha talking to brother
 about so late at night?
[1263.44] Shani?
[1266.24] Who asked you to go to 
Mr. Qasim’s house?
[1269.76] What was the need to go there 
and talk rubbish?
[1273.16] So, I didn’t do anything wrong, 
what I did was right.
[1276.08] I will give you a tight slap,
[1284.64] only then you will understand 
what is right and what is wrong.
[1300.04] Have you seen Mr. Qasim’s status?
[1302.68] What is your position in front of him?
[1309.00] Listen to me very carefully
[1310.96] if I ever see you going to 
Mr. Qasim’s house again,
[1315.28] I will break your legs.
[1326.44] Do you even know that
[1328.00] because of you I tolerated 
so much humiliation today?
[1332.44] I have heard so much from him.
[1334.60] So, who asked you to listen to him?
[1337.68] He must be a lord at his own home,
[1345.12] we don’t need to bend down 
in front of him.
[1347.56] Make your son understand,
[1353.12] tell him
[1355.68] the ones who don’t bend, they break.
[1369.88] What is the position of your son?
[1376.16] He doesn’t know the ABCs of the world
[1382.12] and he is ready to be a big shot.
[1390.64] Okay, now don’t get angry, I will tell him.
[1395.56] Tell your son
[1398.04] else I will make him understand 
my own way.
[1412.64] The things that can be solved 
by talking nicely,
[1416.84] he ruined the whole game with his anger.
[1430.72] Make your son understand,
[1433.08] if I tell him my way, 
he won’t be able to bear it.
[1439.04] Okay, please go away from here,
[1442.28] if you keep on seeing him in front of you,
 you will get angry.
[1494.80] I am here to take her; 
she will come with me.
[1497.84] Look I didn’t call you;
[1500.64] I called your parents; 
Ramsha won’t go with you.
[1504.60] she is my fiancé
[1507.80] and she will go with me, 
no one can stop her, not even you.
[1514.08] Will you come with me or 
should I drag you from here?
[1516.40] Son?
[1518.16] I guess you don’t understand
[1519.80] that I told you Ramsha won’t 
come with you.
[1523.60] And Mr Qasim, even I told you
[1526.16] that she will come with me right now.
[1535.12] What do you want?
[1536.20] Would you leave on your own 
or should I call the guards?
[1540.84] What you are doing is wrong
[1546.20] but remember one thing,
[1548.96] I will file a case against you
[1558.00] for kidnapping her and murdering aunt.
[1566.60] I am scared, I don’t want to go there.
[1571.20] The ones who have been unjust to you
should be scared.
[1581.60] I think
[1583.84] about how many rewards have God kept 
for a good attitude towards other people,
[1596.40] and we are such fools,
[1598.88] instead of trading with God,
[1601.60] we ruin our life and hereafter just 
because of money.
[1676.28] I told you.
[1678.20] How dare you?
[1679.80] What happened Afnan?
[1681.36] When I asked you stay away from 
that girl then how dare you?
[1683.72] You did such a disgusting thing with her
that I can’t believe it.
[1689.00] What are you doing? Leave me,
people are watching.
[1690.96] everyone’s watching?
[1692.28] Everyone should know that this person,
[1694.68] this person is a harasser,
[1697.04] he has taken advantage of a helpless
 and a girl without a family,
[1700.68] he harassed her.
[1702.08] I am ashamed to call you 
my friend today,
[1704.36] a disgusting man like you shouldn’t be
 part of this society.
[1711.68] Is she your lover that you are humiliating
 your friend because of her?
[1715.64] You are disgusting
[1716.68] who is having fun with an outsider 
despite having a wife at home.
[1730.32] Not every person is characterless 
like you are,
[1738.20] neither I have anything 
in my heart like that
[1743.24] nor she is characterless.
[1746.40] And I will kill you if I ever see you 
even near Ramsha next time,
[1755.68] do you understand?
[1794.16] Hello? Are you alive?
[1797.84] Just think that I am alive for you
[1800.68] Right, so many days pass by and you don’t
even bother showing me your face
[1805.12] and now you are talking 
this big stuff.
[1807.48] You know I am very stubborn;
[1809.88] I won’t die that easily
[1813.96] at least I won’t die till 
I tell you a secret.
[1818.84] What secret?
[1820.60] A secret which is very important 
for me to tell you.
[1828.72] So, tell me, where would you meet me?
[1831.24] I am in a shopping mall right now,
[1833.60] I need to get done with some shopping,
you come home in a while,
[1836.20] I will go home then. 
No, no, not at home,
[1839.40] secrets cannot be told at home.
[1842.32] What are you saying? 
I don’t understand anything.
[1844.80] Okay do one thing, 
come here to the mall,
[1848.08] we will meet here only, meanwhile, 
I will get done with some more shopping.
[1851.80] You just wait for me for 15 minutes;
[1853.68] I will be there.
[1855.60] Okay fine, bye.
[1862.80] Sorry Afnan,
[1865.20] I am really sorry.
[1901.68] Mom, now when you go
 to meet Ramsha,
[1903.96] please take me along,
[1905.88] I have heard that Mr. Qasim’s bungalow
is very huge and very beautiful,
[1908.96] I want to see it too.
[1914.16] I will never go there at all.
[1922.80] Whatever you brother has done there 
and brought shame to us,
[1928.44] I will never go there,
[1934.84] what will they think what sort of 
people we are.
[1938.68] Don’t take any tension about it at all.
[1945.32] Rich people don’t have time to think 
about what poor people are thinking.
[1955.76] By the way mom,
[1956.76] you should have brought 
Ramsha’s number at least,
[1959.04] I would have at least got to talk to her.
[1966.68] Why are you looking at me like that?
[1968.56] I haven’t even seen her face for so long, 
I would at least get to talk.
[1977.44] By the way, she had a wish to live
in such a big house,
[1980.40] she must be happy, right?
[1983.52] I don’t know if she is happy or not
[1985.68] but she is very satisfied there.
[1997.28] And I have seen a lot of changes in her,
[2005.24] do you know?
[2007.44] She has become very patient,
[2015.16] she covers her head
[2017.28] and is punctual in offering prayers too,
[2024.24] I guess she has joined some 
Islamic Academy.
[2028.84] What?
[2031.20] Islamic Academy?
[2034.60] Mom, did you see Ramsha only?
[2036.12] Or did you see someone else and 
felt you saw Ramsha?
[2039.12] There is nothing like that,
[2041.36] would I not recognize Ramsha?
[2045.04] What are you even saying?
[2047.08] Human beings change with time,
[2051.12] she changed as well.
[2055.16] That is not possible mom,
[2057.64] Ramsha is the one who changes time,
[2060.12] not herself.
[2068.04] Now I definitely want to meet Ramsha.
[2075.60] Do one thing,
[2076.76] let’s go to Mr. Qasim’s house 
tomorrow only.
[2082.80] I want to say how true are you.
[2086.52] Okay,
[2088.32] if you don’t believe your mom
[2091.92] then what can I say?
[2093.00] Do you mean Ramsha cannot change?
[2120.76] Okay tell me
[2122.24] what was the secret you want to tell?
[2123.96] I am telling, I am telling.
[2129.04] First, you answer a question,
[2132.84] who do you trust the most in this world?
[2136.88] What sort of a question is this?
[2142.20] And what is the connection of this 
to what you are saying?
[2145.44] There is a connection, tell me?
[2152.16] Who do you trust the most 
in the whole world.
[2156.68] Off course on my own self.
[2160.00] yes,
[2162.52] but after yourself?
[2164.84] Umm, after myself, on Afnan.
[2178.88] What happened? 
Why are you laughing?
[2188.32] He is my husband,
[2190.04] off course, if I won’t trust him 
who else will I trust?
[2201.76] A person should trust their life partner.
[2205.64] Yes, but I would never marry a girl
[2208.84] who already has an affair
[2218.88] and would be continuing 
after marriage too.
[2225.32] What are you trying to say?
[2232.76] Please don’t riddle with me.
[2236.36] I just have one answer 
to all these riddles.
[2253.24] Ramsha.
