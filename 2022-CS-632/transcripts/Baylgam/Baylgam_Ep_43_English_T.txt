[22.76] Tabassum.
[25.12] Tabassum, bring me water.
[42.88] Give me water.
[48.68] Okay listen,
[50.52] Tabassum, do one thing.
[52.32] Go keep my bag in the room.
[55.28] I will go and meet uncle.
[58.12] He is not well and Afnan is really sensitive 
towards him nowadays.
[63.40] It is good I ask him how he is.
[65.04] Madam Alizay, elder sir is not at home.
[66.84] Not just elder sir, no one is at home.
[69.00] Why?
[70.16] Everyone has gone to the hospital.
[71.68] Elder sir got really unwell suddenly.
[74.68] Everyone took him to the hospital.
[77.76] What is the problem? 
Why isn’t uncle getting better,
[81.96] and then mama is not there either.
[84.16] What do I do?
[86.08] Give me my bag.
[88.64] I will call mama.
[91.00] I will ask her to come back.
[93.44] She is busy enjoying the wedding,
[95.84] here we are in a problem.
[108.92] She must surely be busy in a function.
[115.04] Why are you standing there 
and staring at me for?
[117.08] Go and make tea for me. 
I have a headache.
[120.40] Yes, sure. I will just bring it.
[122.36] I don’t know where all of them went.
[125.04] Uncle had to get unwell right now.
[163.00] Ramsha. 
Yes?
[166.40] Where are you going?
[168.72] It is time for prayers.
[170.76] I will offer namaz and pray for uncle.
[173.64] If I sit here, I will continue to cry.
[177.36] Right now, uncle doesn’t need our tears,
[179.80] he needs our prayers.
[215.28] You know,
[216.88] when the doctor came and
stayed quiet for a while,
[219.76] all of us got really scared.
[225.80] Thank God you are absolutely fine, uncle.
[229.24] Ramsha, child,
[231.28] God doesn’t burden anyone more than
 their strength and capability.
[244.72] See, I am in front of you 
and absolutely fine,
[247.64] why are you crying for no reason?
[250.48] You are not fine at all. 
Look at your condition.
[260.16] You are getting out of breath, 
talking so little.
[263.64] Listen to me, uncle,
[265.44] you have to take care of yourself now,
[268.20] and you wait, I will call the doctor.
[270.56] You wont anywhere.
[272.44] Afnan has gone to talk to the doctor,
you sit here.
[276.84] Nothing happened, I am fine.
[278.32] This breath will also get fine.
[283.08] Yes, Afnan, what did the doctor say?
[285.60] I have to go home. 
I feel restless in this room.
[287.96] No, no, you lie down.
[289.52] I just spoke to the doctor and came.
[291.68] He has said that you will have 
to stay in the hospital,
[293.92] till your BP doesn’t get normal and 
till your breathing is not in control.
[304.16] Afnan, let me talk to the doctor. 
I don’t know what you have said to him.
[308.20] Dad, why are you insisting like a child.
[314.40] You should stay here,
[315.84] because you are in the habit of doing 
what you want.
[321.68] If you stay here, you wont be able 
to do anything like that.
[323.84] If you go home, 
you will do what you want,
[325.68] and this is why you are in this condition.
[328.28] Ramsha, make him understand.
I am not listening to anything, dad.
[342.20] Okay listen,
[343.44] the doctor has said that we have to 
give him this medication strictly before food.
[349.76] Fine. You give me the medication. 
Greetings uncle.
[351.84] Greetings.
[355.92] How are you feeling now?
[364.68] When I reached home from the office,
[369.28] the maid told me that you got so unwell
that everyone brought you to the hospital.
[378.64] I got really worried hearing it. 
Are you fine now?
[382.60] I am fine, child. Don’t worry.
I am fine.
[390.88] Everyone is worried for no reason.
[398.40] I had even called mama, 
but she didn’t answer my call.
[402.04] I am sure she is busy somewhere.
[405.64] Alizay, don’t tell Afsheen.
[409.56] She went to her in-laws after 
a long time for a function.
[413.80] When she hears it,
she will get really worried.
[416.00] She will leave everything and come.
[427.40] Okay, I will go check on Afnan.
[435.52] Don’t worry, I am fine, Ramsha.
[438.56] You too are listening to Afnan.
[442.04] It is good that you stay in the hospital 
for a few days,
[444.64] then you will be taken care of properly.
[447.16] You will get your medication 
and food on time.
[449.36] You will be fine.
[451.16] A person becomes a patient coming 
to the hospital.
[456.28] and I wanted to ask when do 
we need these tests done?
[459.56] Should we get them done 
in the evening?
[460.76] When the doctor comes 
he will inform you.
[461.96] The doctor will tell me. 
Fine. Thank you.
[464.40] Afnan, come on, give me this file.
[467.32] Come on, give it.
[470.04] Listen, you must be really tired.
[472.76] Now you go home and rest, 
I will stay with uncle.
[477.16] No, thank you very much.
[480.80] I can stay with my dad myself, 
I can take care of him. Give it.
[485.24] What do you mean you can stay 
with your dad?
[488.44] I too have a relation with him, 
he is my uncle.
[491.08] Really?
[496.04] Thank God you remembered Alizay,
[498.80] or else you forget this often.
[502.64] Afnan, please,
[504.12] this is not a place for having an argument.
[506.12] We will talk about this later.
[512.48] Right now, you are really tired,
[514.04] you please go home and rest.
[515.60] I will stay here with him.
[520.00] Listen to me.
[521.36] Don’t worry, I am here. 
I will take care of him.
[526.00] Okay fine,
[527.84] go, and also ask Ramsha, if she wants 
to go home with me, I will take her.
[531.52] I had asked Ramsha, 
she doesn’t want to go.
[534.32] She will stay here for some more time.
[540.48] And if she wants to go,
I will call the driver,
[544.12] he will pick her up. 
Fine.
[546.88] Hear it clearly once, 
the medication is listed here.
[549.52] I have also explained to Ramsha.
[551.60] Please make sure he gets them 
timely and yes,
[554.44] update me on dad’s health.
[557.20] You don’t worry, if there is something,
 I will call you.
[561.48] Thank you.
[685.24] Where did you go?
[686.76] I went to offer prayers.
[688.84] You know,
[690.36] I have come directly from the office. 
I am really tired.
[696.96] If I stay with uncle today,
[700.00] then I will fall ill.
[701.88] Please, can you stay here today?
[704.00] Yes, fine, I will stay.
[706.08] Okay, great.
[709.64] Okay listen, don’t tell Afnan that 
I have asked you to stay here.
[720.56] In fact, if he calls, then don’t answer his call.
[724.12] I didn’t bring my phone in my hurry. 
I don’t have my phone.
[727.80] Okay, that’s even better.
[730.08] You sit here.
[732.04] Okay listen. 
Yes?
[733.64] If uncle is not well, then call me 
from the reception,
[736.96] I will come. 
Okay.
[759.32] Do you know?
[762.00] I don’t like it at home without you.
[765.16] The home looks really vacant.
[768.00] What are you looking at?
Do you want something?
[777.08] I am seeing that daughters are so good.
[786.24] You bring food for me daily everyday.
[794.80] You take care of me all day long.
[801.44] You don't even look worried
[813.44] You are the same one who I used to
ask for some work,
[819.72] you used to get annoyed,
[824.72] but now,
[827.76] you look so smart.
[832.96] That was not annoyance, papa,
[836.16] it was my love and affection.
[841.88] I felt that I can say anything,
I can say no to anything,
[847.32] my papa will not get upset with me.
[882.16] Tabassum.
[883.04] Yes, madam.
[884.08] Where is Afnan?
[885.40] Mr. Afnan is sleeping.
[886.72] Do one thing, get the guest room unlocked,
[888.60] will sleep there. Go.
[890.20] Yes, sure.
[892.80] Thank God Afnan is sleeping,
[894.28] now I will go sleep comfortably 
in the guest room.
[897.72] I don’t get to rest nowadays.
[956.68] Ramsha.
[958.44] Ramsha.
[976.40] Ramsha.
[980.72] Greetings.
[981.88] What is this?
[985.12] If you have not slept at night, then
you should have gone home and slept.
[988.52] The person who has to give the duty
should stay in the hospital.
[991.84] You are sleeping here, 
who will take care of dad?
[994.68] Where is Alizay? Call her.
[996.76] She had gone home.
[1000.84] She went home?
[1005.72] When? She must have just left.
[1015.40] Oh man.
[1018.08] I had told her to call me 
once before going home,
[1021.60] so that I would come for the duty.
[1027.00] She left him with you, 
and you were sleeping here.
[1030.40] You should have taken care of dad.
[1032.76] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1034.96] Okay, I had asked you to get the injection 
last night, did you get it?
[1038.20] Yes, yes, here is the injection.
[1043.12] Okay, I had asked you to submit 
Mr. Qasim’s blood report.
[1046.20] Yes, yes, I had asked my wife, Alizay,
[1049.08] she must have brought the report to you.
[1050.96] Who, Alizay?
[1052.20] She is here since last night,
[1073.12] and please quickly get the blood report 
and submit it,
[1076.60] the doctor must be on his way.
[1135.44] Right now, you are really tired, 
you please go home and rest.
[1138.48] I will stay here with him.
[1141.00] Listen to me. Don’t worry, I am here. 
I will take care of him.
[1145.28] I had asked Ramsha, 
she doesn’t want to go.
[1148.36] She will stay here for some more time.
[1150.00] And if she wants to go, I will call the driver,
 he will pick her up.
[1156.00] Who, Alizay?
[1157.12] She is here since last night.
[1208.08] The doctor is here, 
I will go and find out.
[1210.96] Shani,
[1212.72] this hospital is really big, 
it also seems really expensive.
[1216.12] The fees also be a lot.
[1218.52] You brought me here for no reason,
you should have waited for a while.
[1221.20] We should have visited 
the doctor in the street.
[1224.40] yes, you are right.
[1227.36] We would have waited for a few more days,
 so that you would have gotten unwell further.
[1231.52] All that is happening with you was 
because of worrying about money.
[1236.00] Earlier, elder mama was there, 
she would bring you to the hospital,
[1238.60] when you would be a little unwell.
[1240.20] Now she is not here, see 
what you have done to yourself.
[1243.04] There is no one to care for you.
[1244.32] Okay go, leave all this, 
go and check on the doctor.
[1248.36] Listen Shani,
[1250.16] the woman can take care of everyone,
[1255.32] apart from herself.
[1257.44] This is a woman’s nature.
[1260.60] Go.
[1267.20] Greetings.
[1268.64] We had taken an appointment earlier.
[1288.64] Mr. Qasim is absolutely fine.
[1291.16] Today, we will keep him under observation
 for one day.
[1294.80] Sure.
[1295.60] and he will get discharged tomorrow.
[1297.24] Thank you so much doctor. 
Don’t worry.
[1298.88] Thank you. 
Thank you.
[1302.96] Did you check on all the medication?
[1304.60] Yes, sir, I will give it timely.
[1307.04] Absolutely right, till I don’t come back,
[1309.32] you please don’t go anywhere from here.
[1310.88] Yes, sir, sure. Don’t worry.
[1313.24] Thank you. 
Thank you, sir.
[1320.24] Will I have to invite you to come along?
Come on.
[1323.36] I am fine here.
[1325.44] I will stay with uncle, 
I will take care of him.
[1328.56] And I am fine, I am not tired,
I am completely fresh.
[1334.24] I am waiting for you in the car, 
come quickly.
[1429.80] I don’t know where this boy is.
[1432.32] He stays where he goes.
[1437.84] Mama.
[1439.00] Hey, where were you? I have been 
waiting for you for so long.
[1441.28] Listen to me, I just saw Ramsha here.
[1443.24] What? Ramsha?
[1445.52] Sister in law? Here? 
Where?
[1447.36] Elder mama was not with her, 
she was alone.
[1450.48] She sat in a big car and left.
[1452.80] Okay.
[1462.04] Let’s go home.
[1469.48] Will you eat something?
[1473.60] Why are you not responding? Tell me, 
will you eat something or not?
[1480.32] Why did you stop the car?
[1483.16] Ramsha, you stayed with dad all night long,
[1486.64] you were taking care of him.
[1487.88] Obviously, you wouldn’t have gotten
a chance to eat anything,
[1490.08] so let’s eat something.
[1492.24] I am not hungry, I want to go home.
[1499.52] But I am really hungry.
[1501.64] I didn’t have breakfast in my hurry
to get to the hospital.
[1505.72] Now I will eat something.
Come on.
[1508.72] Come. Come on, come on, 
we will sit and eat.
[1510.16] You will like it. Come on.
[1539.68] It is evening, if you want I can order it 
for you, you can eat it.
[1545.08] No, I am not hungry.
[1546.84] What do you mean you are not hungry?
[1549.08] Even in restaurant I ordered 
things you liked,
[1552.56] but you didn’t eat anything.
[1557.68] Is all okay?
[1559.72] You remember even today?
[1563.84] There are some things a person 
doesn’t forget all their lives.
[1567.08] Really?
[1568.64] I had heard that a person only remember
things that are important for them.
[1578.08] According to you, I was never 
important for you, Afnan.
[1587.08] Anyway,
[1589.04] it makes no difference to me now.
[1599.40] Yes,
[1602.48] I can see it makes no difference to you.
[1605.76] You seem really satisfied now.
[1607.64] I have learned to be thankful for 
what God has given me.
[1617.96] And I have stopped running 
after the things,
[1621.56] that I couldn’t get.
[1658.44] No Shani,
[1660.64] I think you surely have a misunderstanding,
[1664.40] that girl must be someone else, 
and not Ramsha.
[1667.32] I have no misunderstanding mama,
[1669.44] I recognize her well. How is it possible?
[1671.84] I mean, you make her stand in a crowd
of millions and not just thousands,
[1674.24] I will recognize her.
[1676.56] Hey, if it was Ramsha,
[1679.88] then elder mama would be there as well,
why would she be alone?
[1687.12] Is elder mama with her everywhere?
[1689.40] Hospital is not a place for outing, brother.
[1695.40] She must have surely gone to 
get elder mama’s check up done.
[1698.28] But you said that she went alone 
with someone in the car.
[1707.60] I don’t know. I just know that
[1709.60] elder mama was not with her.
[1713.60] I was sure,
[1716.52] I had said it earlier.
[1722.52] I had a doubt. In fact, not a doubt,
[1725.92] I was sure, sister in law is hiding somewhere
 in this city along with Ramsha.
[1740.28] Now you will see,
[1742.88] how suddenly someday,
[1746.04] she will come to this home 
with the police.
[1752.68] What is the problem, papa? 
Nothing like this will happen.
[1759.88] If they had to do something like this,
 then they would have done it
[1762.56] and the police would have come 
to our home.
[1763.96] You and I wouldn’t have been home,
we would be in jail.
[1769.20] Yes, I think Shani is absolutely right.
[1774.96] Okay fine,
[1776.64] in a way this is good.
[1778.76] At least we found out that 
where our beloved sister in law,
[1785.04] our beloved niece are.
[1798.84] Now we will have no difficulty 
in finding them.
[1804.28] It is good.
[1825.24] Hello.
[1828.40] Yes.
[1831.44] Mama,
[1833.60] but elder mama had said she would 
take Ramsha away from this city,
[1839.28] but she is here.
[1842.16] If she is here, then where is she?
[1844.32] And if papa finds out, then?
[1863.92] They have not given the details 
in the contract.
[1866.76] Yes,
[1867.92] you email me. I will see.
[1872.32] Afnan, what is this nonsense?
Really?
[1875.32] And where were the manners in 
leaving dad with Ramsha.
[1880.08] No, Ramsha told me herself that 
she will stay with uncle.
[1889.64] That is why I came home, 
what is there to be so worried in this?
[1894.24] Ramsha told you and you accepted 
what she said?
[1896.44] Oh wow, great.
[1901.80] I cannot believe that you can leave dad
with a stranger.
[1905.52] Come on, Afnan,
[1906.88] she eats in our home, 
lives with luxuries,
[1909.72] at that time she is not a stranger.
[1915.64] And after all, uncle doesn’t consider her
 a stranger.
[1918.32] If he considers her his niece, then let her 
fulfill her responsibility a little.
[1921.76] What are you doing? Why are you not 
accepting your mistake?
[1924.24] You are making noise for no reason, Afnan.
[1926.40] So what if I left her there?
[1928.64] She knows uncle’s entire schedule, 
his medication, in fact, I did good.
[1933.12] You know what the issue with 
people like you is?
[1939.64] You people think that you are right
in every matter,
[1942.96] you make no mistakes.
[1944.48] And then these mistakes become 
a problem for others.
[1948.20] Okay, Afnan, leave it, why are you arguing
 for no reason?
[1951.48] Uncle is unwell anyway.
[1959.00] I am going to have breakfast, 
you too come alone, we will have tea.
[1961.68] There is no need.
[1963.04] I don’t have so much time, 
I have to reach dad
[1965.68] and after all this is lunch time,
[1969.60] when you are having your breakfast.
[1971.84] I hope you will be quick or you will have 
to eat lunch with dinner.
[1974.72] What is the problem, Afnan?
[1977.52] You never acknowledge 
any effort of mine.
[1981.16] I took an off cause of uncle and 
you don’t see anything.
[1985.68] You didn’t take an off cause of dad,
[1988.12] you took an off to sleep, 
and you did that.
[1991.56] Yes, so what? 
If I slept a little extra.
[1994.12] I had an off, I slept, 
what is wrong in this?
[1997.76] You are impossible.
[2014.48] Hey, dad, one minute. 
One minute.
[2016.60] What?
Something looks incomplete.
[2019.76] This is for your signature look.
[2023.44] Come on. Come on. Lets go,
[2025.96] and what is the need for this wheel chair? 
I am fine, I can walk and go.
[2029.84] Dad, what is wrong with you?
[2032.52] This is a really big problem of yours.
[2034.84] As soon as you feel a little healthy,
[2036.84] you start behaving like superman.
[2039.32] The one who has a capable and 
obedient son like you,
[2043.48] even if he gets unwell and old, their emotions
 stay young like superman.
[2048.40] Brother take this wheel chair,
[2050.68] and where is doctor Umar, 
I have to meet him.
[2053.12] Sir Dr. Umar would be 
in the OPD right now.
[2055.32] Fine, dad you have a seat.
[2056.96] As soon as he gets free from the OPD,
then send him here.
[2059.20] No, no need to worry him.
I will go and thank him myself.
[2063.60] The way he took care of me, 
and I don’t thank him,
[2066.12] it wont look good. Come on, 
we will go ourselves.
[2067.96] Dad, he just did his duty. 
That it.
[2070.00] Son, if he did his duty, 
then it is also our duty
[2072.84] to thank him from the bottom of 
our heart.
[2075.32] Okay, come on, sit.
[2076.72] Okay, come on, we will go. 
I am fine.
[2079.56] You don’t listen to me.
[2098.40] Even in restaurant I ordered 
things you liked,
[2101.96] but you didn’t eat anything.
[2105.20] Is all okay?
[2107.28] You remember even today?
[2111.44] There are some things a person 
doesn’t forget all their lives.
[2114.64] Really?
[2116.20] I had heard that a person only remember 
things that are important for them.
[2123.28] According to you, I was never important 
for you, Afnan.
[2140.16] I can see it makes no difference to you.
[2143.52] You seem really satisfied now.
[2145.52] I have learned to be thankful for 
what God has given me.
[2152.60] And I have stopped running 
after the things,
[2156.36] that I couldn’t get.
[2186.60] Alizay.
[2188.96] Alizay. 
Yes?
[2192.48] I don’t know, my heart is restless.
[2197.32] Because of dad’s health…
[2200.76] I am going to dad’s room 
to ask how he is.
[2203.24] Yes, go.
