I mean, I am studying right now 
I will have my final year exams. Because of that I don’t want to get married, so that my education doesn’t get disturbed. Child, this sounds good coming 
from a person whose entire attention is on studies. But your attention is towards
something else. Do I not know? Anyway, I have told your mother to find
 a good proposal, and finalize things. And fix the wedding date for 
after your exams. Papa, you don’t understand… Ramsha, now it is your turn
 to understand. You said no to marrying Shani, me and your mother agreed. We didn’t argue, 
nor were we strict with you. We have always given importance 
to your happiness, so now being a good daughter, it is also your responsibility to keep the words of your parents. Go, prepare your exams. Come on. That’s the thing. I don’t understand myself 
what I should do now. Ramsha, now you have to decide this. Do you want to spend your life like this or do you want to change your life. Look, if you keep on rejecting 
such good offers then you will not be able to get 
anything you want in life. You are right. Hania, what do I do? 
I want to get out of all this, but no one at home will support me. 
I know that. You tell me, what do I do now? You do one thing, go to Islamabad. Danish Kamal has a big 
production house there, he will give you work along
with accommodation. Islamabad? So far? How will I go alone? Yes, so, Islamabad is not that far. People go to a different country 
to make their career and you are worried about 
going to Islamabad? I am not worried. I know that the family wont let me go. Then your acting is done. You will have to go to a different country
 for the shoot, what will you do, then? Yes, you are right about that. You have to go abroad for shoots too. And my papa? He never took me out of Karachi, 
how will he let me go out of the country? Ramsha, it is your decision now, do you want to live your life 
with these regrets or do you want to fulfill these dreams? It is up to you. Annie, child, please prepare tea. Sure. and you, Ramsha, wash the dishes. Me? Yes, if not you then who else? Sister in law, congratulations to you. Congratulations? Salma, congratulations for what? Hey, I forgot to tell you. The woman who had come 
to meet Ramsha, she likes Ramsha for her son. And now she wants the girl 
to meet her son, so you can call her 
when you have time. That is fine, Salma, but first let me talk to Ramsha’s father, then I will call them. Do what you see is fit. Our Ramsha, is so pretty, 
they had to say yes. Salma, thank you very much, you made so much effort for 
my daughter’s proposal. May God bless you for it. Sister in law, what are you saying? Ramsha is my daughter too and we want that our daughters go
to their home as soon as possible. Amen. You are having a lot of fun, right? Hello. I could see clearly how much 
you were smiling. I was only praising you, 
what is wrong in that I said? Annie, don’t act naïve. You know well that I like Afnan 
and I want to marry him and you are adding salt 
to my wounds. If you really love, Afnan, then tell him everything 
about you honestly. Tell him to bring a proposal 
for you here. Have you gone mad? Have you seen Afnan? The status he has. Not just him, no one from his family
 would want to come here. I will tell Afnan the truth when I too have a home 
as big as Afnan, a big car, money, fame, all everything. That’s when I will tell Afnan, so that he or his family has no problems 
coming here. Because you get married 
in your equals, right? Proposals don’t get finalized like this. Anyway, believe me, Annie, all this will happen soon. How do you see such big dreams, 
Ramsha? What do you think? Earning money is so easy 
that a person goes out, breaks the money from the trees
and becomes rich. Hey my love, think something like this is going 
to happen now. Ramsha, tell me honestly, what is going on
 in your head. Hell no. You think I am mad that 
I tell you my plans? After all, whenever I have told you,
all your plans have gotten ruined. You mean to say that 
in all your plans… There is nothing like that. 
After all, don’t put so burden your small brain 
so much. You care for me so much, 
you really sympathize with me, right? Then do one thing, 
wash all the dishes. I am not washing the dishes. I will just make tea, 
you will wash the dishes. Look child, you will wash the dishes. Come on, pick up all the things, 
and go wash the dishes. Bring green tea to my room. Bring green tea to my room. The boy’s name is Nabeel and sister Asma was saying, 
they are a good family, they are well educated family 
and they are also affluent. They have a big shoe factory and they also have three to four shops. The wedding planner was telling me, he has two sisters, both are married. One is in Dubai and the other in Muscat. The way she has praised them, it feels that they are good and sober people. What do you say, Anwar? Brother, I feel this proposal is suitable
from all angles. I would say go ahead. Fine, then, tell those people to come over, and yes bring the boy along. If the matters are fine, then we shouldn’t delay 
in Ramsha’s wedding. Salma, let me talk to Nabeel’s mother. I will just get you talk to him. You get me tea. Yes, yes, I will just bring it. God will make it all fine. Ramsha. Ramsha. Ramsha? What is this? You have not changed? 
Those people are here, come on, quickly change… Mama, listen to me once. Please…
I have had enough. I will not hear you say no 
from you at any cost. You are aware of your father’s anger well. Come on, change quickly and come. Don’t take long. I am coming. They do what they want. I am telling them, 
I don’t want to get married. I don’t want to get married, 
no one understands me. Nabeel’s father didn’t come 
with us today, I apologize for that. He had to go to Hyderabad 
for something important. We have an office in Hyderabad too. But as soon as he comes back 
from there, he will surely come to meet you people. No issues. This is his own home, he can come when he wants. What is there to apologize in this? Nabeel, son, have something. Thank you, aunty. I was in the office a little while back, 
so I ate from there and came. Hey, I had told my son
 to take the day off, but he takes up after his father. They only takes off on Eids, 
other than that they have no other offs. That’s how businesses work. We have the same setting. If I am busy, Anwar takes care of things. If Anwar is busy, 
I take care of everything. Even we don’t close the shop. Uncle, you know, you have to give time to business. Absolutely right. Okay tell me, what other hobbies 
do you have other than the business? Nothing special. I get free from the office, 
so I sit with friends. And I don’t have a lot of friends anyway. Hey, you know of the environment 
nowadays. I don’t let my children go to the neighbourhood
or friends a lot. Straight to the office from home, 
and home from the office. That’s how life is. That is really good. Brother, have a samosa. You have some. 
Yes, okay then. Hey, Mehnaz, you call Ramsha. At least what we came for, 
at least that should be fulfilled. Yes, yes, Salma must be bringing her. Hey, she is here. 
She is here. Come on, sit. Greetings. 
Greetings. Ramsha is really pretty. Your daughter is really pretty. Hello. Yes, were you calling me? Yes, I was calling you. But like always you were busy, 
you didn’t answer my call. Hey, what do I do? I am really busy cause of the new branch and then I had to buy tickets too. 
You tell me, what happened? Tickets? Why? Are you going somewhere? I am going to Islamabad. Islamabad? You know I too am going to Islamabad. I have a shoot there. Really? and the two of us are meeting 
in Islamabad, right? Listen, I am going for work. Yes, so I too am going for work. There is a huge difference 
between our work. Afnan, work is work and I have noticed this. You always consider my work 
and me small. No, I didn’t mean to say that. 
Don’t misunderstand me. Okay fine, let me check my schedule 
then I will tell you if we will be able to meet
in Islamabad or not. Mr. Afnan, no matter how 
your schedule is, you are meeting me in Islamabad. And yes, your responsibility is that you have to take me around,
 Islamabad, okay? man, you too at times talk like a child. Okay fine, we will meet. Oh wow, where did we get 
so many sweets from? From your in-laws. From my in-laws? It came from brother Nabeel’s home. You made him your brother, so soon? I will teach you a lesson. Decent girls call their 
brother in law their brother. Really? Oh my throat. You too eat it. 
You have it. Why are you asking me questions? Ask all your questions from mama
and elder mama, who have accepted these sweets. I will question them well, 
you eat this entire sweet! God knows who that girl was. No, I didn’t see her face. Okay tell me, should I be worried cause of that girl? Okay thank God, at least you comforted me. I liked it. Okay fine, Okay Mazhar, goodbye. I shouldn’t sit so satisfied. Here you go, tea. I was thinking that you and Anwar should have 
investigated a little more. Hey, why do we fix the proposal 
in so much haste. Nowadays, anyway, there are 
a lot of frauds in proposals. My heart is worried thinking that. Hey no need to be worried or scared. Me and Anwar have investigated well. I find them to be a good 
and decent family. They are living in the neighbourhood 
for twenty five years. In fact, I even met Nabeel’s father. He seemed like a decent man to me. I would say that you give them 
the date for the function. Okay, fine, as you wish. In fact, do one thing, tell them to bring some close relatives on Sunday
and do the ceremony with simplicity. What is wrong, Sajid? How will I make all this preparation 
so quickly. You don’t have to make preparations 
right now, we will prepare on the wedding. Hey, me and Anwar, will make arrangements
for food for a few people. When the proposal get fixed, I too will be satisfied. Hello. Yes, this is Ramsha. Can I talk to Danish Kamal? Hey Ramsha, what is wrong? What are you thinking about? 
I have to prepare food. You still haven’t chopped the vegetables. I am chopping it, mama. 
Calm down… Greetings. 
Greetings. The food is still not ready?
I am preparing it shortly. Okay. Yes, Mehnaz, this is one hundred thousand,
we need to give it to Adil. Keep it safe. Okay? Brother. Oh, sweets. Who brought it? 
Papa or elder papa? It came from Ramsha’s in-laws. A few days they were talking 
about Ramsha’s proposal. They said yes, 
so they sent sweets. It is not good at all. 
It is really bad. You didn’t like the sweets 
or did you not like it that Ramsha’s proposal got fixed? Have you not started talking a lot? I feel you are spending 
a lot of time with her. The girls who talk like this, 
I want to cut their tongue. Come on, go from here. Leave. She talks too much. tell me, what is bad in this proposal? There is nothing good in this proposal 
either, mama. You think yourself when my friends 
ask me what does my husband do? What will I say? Shoe business. Oh God, since my father didn’t find
any other proposal. Listen, they don’t run a shoe business. In fact, they have a big factory of shoes. And you know? The family is really good, 
they have a big family. What is wrong with you mama? No matter how good this proposal is,
I don’t want to get married here. No one is taking your advice and neither are you being told. Your father has said that those people
are coming to complete the ceremony on Sunday and I am going to go do 
your shopping tomorrow. If you want to come along with me, 
then come or I will shop by my liking. Aunt did all this, right? Tell her, if the proposal is so good,
then get her daughter married. Why are you people using me 
as a scapegoat? Fear God. And stop being thankless. She did a favour on us, 
with her daughter being there, she cared about you. Instead of being thankful to her,
you are being thankless. Fear God. God put some sense in this girl. Mama, this is the limit. The limit! Who is it?
Open up. What happened aunt? Why did you lock the door
 from inside? The boys in the street 
they were screaming so much, so I closed the door to sleep. These children make noise daily. What is wrong aunt? I closed the door to sleep 
so what hell broke loose? Okay sister in law is calling you
for so long. What if mama saw me 
leaving her room? Or she opened her cupboard and 
saw that there is no money there? What will happen now? Why is she calling me? Sister in law asked you to bring 
clothes from the roof, why did you not bring them till now? Yes, I had forgotten to bring the clothes, I will bring them in two minutes. Bring them quickly, if the clothes remain in the sun for too long,
then they will lose their colour. I will make you people lose 
your colour now. Really soon…
Ramsha! I am coming. Greetings. Greetings. 
I wanted to meet Mr. Qasim. Mr. Qasim? Okay fine. Come, 
he is sitting in the lawn. Okay. 
Come on. Greetings, Mr. Qasim. Greetings. I apologize, I didn’t recognize you. My name is Sajid. Mr. Usman must have spoken to you 
about me. We have a wholesale shop of grocery. Yes, yes, I spoke to brother Usman. Afnan, son arrange tea. 
Yes. Yes, brother Usman…
you have a seat… No, I am fine. 
Hey, come on. Sit. Thank you. I was talking to brother Usman 
in this regards, he mentioned both you brothers. He said that you two are really honest 
and the products you have are really good too. It is all God’s blessing Mr. Qasim. We try to work well and the customer
has no complaint, and even Mr. Usman gives us all the list. We make his packet and deliver it to him. Till now he has no complaints 
from us till today. That’s good, every Muslim should be true 
to their promise and word. Have tea. 
Thank you very much. Mr. Sajid we will require one hundred to 
one fifty packets of grocery every month. It will be done. If you give us the address of the people 
you want it delivered to, we will deliver it. We have our own suzukis. That is really good. Meaning, if you can do this too, 
we will not have this responsibility. It will be easy for us. Afnan, the people we send the groceries
to give their addresses along with the grocery list to Mr. Sajid. Mr. Sajid, this is my son, Afnan. I just met him. So, whatever matters 
there are there with you, he will deal with them, and he will 
also resolve the payment issues, if there are any. I just want to say to you that if the quality seems good and 
the price is reasonable, then we will also get all the groceries 
made from you even in Ramadan. You don’t worry, 
you will never get a complaint. Dad, I am going to the office. Yes, yes, fine son. 
Sir, goodbye. Yes,  yes, thank you. May God protect you son. Mama, I am hungry. Give me breakfast. Breakfast? Is this time for breakfast? I am preparing for lunch. Having an off doesn’t mean that you stay 
awake all night and wake up late in the morning. Go, make tea and have rusk with it. I just get one day to sleep, mama, still you have an objection on it. Okay, make a fried flatbread. There is no fried flatbread. Go make tea and have it with rusk. Hey, child, Annie, make extra tea. I too will have it. And look at this Ramsha, 
she is still sleeping. This girl has made my life hell. I will check on her. Ramsha. Oh God. Ramsha. Mama, I don’t want to have rusk. There is flour in the fridge, I will make 
fried flatbread myself and eat it. Useless. Okay, find me the flour in the fridge. I am coming. I think the queen is still sleeping. Ramsha. Ramsha. She is not even in the bathroom. Where can she go so early
 in the morning? She must have gone upstairs 
to the roof to make a Tik Tok. Ramsha. Ramsha. Ramsha. God knows where she went.
 Ramsha. Hey… What happened? 
Why are you so worried? That… Salma, that…
Sister in law, what happened? All okay? I don’t know where Ramsha has gone. She is not even in her room. Where is there to worry in this? She must be sitting in a corner here
 and making a video. Hey, I looked all around, 
I even went to the roof, I have looked all around the house, I don’t know where she went. Okay…yes, I will find her phone. She must have kept her phone 
and gone. Yes, I too haven’t seen her 
since morning. She must have surely left her 
phone here somewhere and gone. If you people had understood me, and let me progress in life, then maybe I wouldn’t have 
taken this step. I didn’t want to leave the home 
and go like this. But I have to leave. Papa’s fear, and your strictness was a hurdle 
in my success. So today I am leaving everything today 
and going on my new journey. Sister in law, what happened? I know you and papa will get really upset
 with me reading this letter, you won’t even forgive me, so it is useless to ask you 
to forgive me. Your beloved daughter, Ramsha. Compartment number 11482. It is not here. 11483..
