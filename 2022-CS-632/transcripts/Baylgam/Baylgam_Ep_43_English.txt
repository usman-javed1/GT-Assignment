Tabassum. Tabassum, bring me water. Give me water. Okay listen, Tabassum, do one thing. Go keep my bag in the room. I will go and meet uncle. He is not well and Afnan is really sensitive 
towards him nowadays. It is good I ask him how he is. Madam Alizay, elder sir is not at home. Not just elder sir, no one is at home. Why? Everyone has gone to the hospital. Elder sir got really unwell suddenly. Everyone took him to the hospital. What is the problem? 
Why isn’t uncle getting better, and then mama is not there either. What do I do? Give me my bag. I will call mama. I will ask her to come back. She is busy enjoying the wedding, here we are in a problem. She must surely be busy in a function. Why are you standing there 
and staring at me for? Go and make tea for me. 
I have a headache. Yes, sure. I will just bring it. I don’t know where all of them went. Uncle had to get unwell right now. Ramsha. 
Yes? Where are you going? It is time for prayers. I will offer namaz and pray for uncle. If I sit here, I will continue to cry. Right now, uncle doesn’t need our tears, he needs our prayers. You know, when the doctor came and
stayed quiet for a while, all of us got really scared. Thank God you are absolutely fine, uncle. Ramsha, child, God doesn’t burden anyone more than
 their strength and capability. See, I am in front of you 
and absolutely fine, why are you crying for no reason? You are not fine at all. 
Look at your condition. You are getting out of breath, 
talking so little. Listen to me, uncle, you have to take care of yourself now, and you wait, I will call the doctor. You wont anywhere. Afnan has gone to talk to the doctor,
you sit here. Nothing happened, I am fine. This breath will also get fine. Yes, Afnan, what did the doctor say? I have to go home. 
I feel restless in this room. No, no, you lie down. I just spoke to the doctor and came. He has said that you will have 
to stay in the hospital, till your BP doesn’t get normal and 
till your breathing is not in control. Afnan, let me talk to the doctor. 
I don’t know what you have said to him. Dad, why are you insisting like a child. You should stay here, because you are in the habit of doing 
what you want. If you stay here, you wont be able 
to do anything like that. If you go home, 
you will do what you want, and this is why you are in this condition. Ramsha, make him understand.
I am not listening to anything, dad. Okay listen, the doctor has said that we have to 
give him this medication strictly before food. Fine. You give me the medication. 
Greetings uncle. Greetings. How are you feeling now? When I reached home from the office, the maid told me that you got so unwell
that everyone brought you to the hospital. I got really worried hearing it. 
Are you fine now? I am fine, child. Don’t worry.
I am fine. Everyone is worried for no reason. I had even called mama, 
but she didn’t answer my call. I am sure she is busy somewhere. Alizay, don’t tell Afsheen. She went to her in-laws after 
a long time for a function. When she hears it,
she will get really worried. She will leave everything and come. Okay, I will go check on Afnan. Don’t worry, I am fine, Ramsha. You too are listening to Afnan. It is good that you stay in the hospital 
for a few days, then you will be taken care of properly. You will get your medication 
and food on time. You will be fine. A person becomes a patient coming 
to the hospital. and I wanted to ask when do 
we need these tests done? Should we get them done 
in the evening? When the doctor comes 
he will inform you. The doctor will tell me. 
Fine. Thank you. Afnan, come on, give me this file. Come on, give it. Listen, you must be really tired. Now you go home and rest, 
I will stay with uncle. No, thank you very much. I can stay with my dad myself, 
I can take care of him. Give it. What do you mean you can stay 
with your dad? I too have a relation with him, 
he is my uncle. Really? Thank God you remembered Alizay, or else you forget this often. Afnan, please, this is not a place for having an argument. We will talk about this later. Right now, you are really tired, you please go home and rest. I will stay here with him. Listen to me. Don’t worry, I am here. 
I will take care of him. Okay fine, go, and also ask Ramsha, if she wants 
to go home with me, I will take her. I had asked Ramsha, 
she doesn’t want to go. She will stay here for some more time. And if she wants to go,
I will call the driver, he will pick her up. 
Fine. Hear it clearly once, 
the medication is listed here. I have also explained to Ramsha. Please make sure he gets them 
timely and yes, update me on dad’s health. You don’t worry, if there is something,
 I will call you. Thank you. Where did you go? I went to offer prayers. You know, I have come directly from the office. 
I am really tired. If I stay with uncle today, then I will fall ill. Please, can you stay here today? Yes, fine, I will stay. Okay, great. Okay listen, don’t tell Afnan that 
I have asked you to stay here. In fact, if he calls, then don’t answer his call. I didn’t bring my phone in my hurry. 
I don’t have my phone. Okay, that’s even better. You sit here. Okay listen. 
Yes? If uncle is not well, then call me 
from the reception, I will come. 
Okay. Do you know? I don’t like it at home without you. The home looks really vacant. What are you looking at?
Do you want something? I am seeing that daughters are so good. You bring food for me daily everyday. You take care of me all day long. You don't even look worried You are the same one who I used to
ask for some work, you used to get annoyed, but now, you look so smart. That was not annoyance, papa, it was my love and affection. I felt that I can say anything,
I can say no to anything, my papa will not get upset with me. Tabassum. Yes, madam. Where is Afnan? Mr. Afnan is sleeping. Do one thing, get the guest room unlocked, will sleep there. Go. Yes, sure. Thank God Afnan is sleeping, now I will go sleep comfortably 
in the guest room. I don’t get to rest nowadays. Ramsha. Ramsha. Ramsha. Greetings. What is this? If you have not slept at night, then
you should have gone home and slept. The person who has to give the duty
should stay in the hospital. You are sleeping here, 
who will take care of dad? Where is Alizay? Call her. She had gone home. She went home? When? She must have just left. Oh man. I had told her to call me 
once before going home, so that I would come for the duty. She left him with you, 
and you were sleeping here. You should have taken care of dad. Greetings. 
Greetings. Okay, I had asked you to get the injection 
last night, did you get it? Yes, yes, here is the injection. Okay, I had asked you to submit 
Mr. Qasim’s blood report. Yes, yes, I had asked my wife, Alizay, she must have brought the report to you. Who, Alizay? She is here since last night, and please quickly get the blood report 
and submit it, the doctor must be on his way. Right now, you are really tired, 
you please go home and rest. I will stay here with him. Listen to me. Don’t worry, I am here. 
I will take care of him. I had asked Ramsha, 
she doesn’t want to go. She will stay here for some more time. And if she wants to go, I will call the driver,
 he will pick her up. Who, Alizay? She is here since last night. The doctor is here, 
I will go and find out. Shani, this hospital is really big, 
it also seems really expensive. The fees also be a lot. You brought me here for no reason,
you should have waited for a while. We should have visited 
the doctor in the street. yes, you are right. We would have waited for a few more days,
 so that you would have gotten unwell further. All that is happening with you was 
because of worrying about money. Earlier, elder mama was there, 
she would bring you to the hospital, when you would be a little unwell. Now she is not here, see 
what you have done to yourself. There is no one to care for you. Okay go, leave all this, 
go and check on the doctor. Listen Shani, the woman can take care of everyone, apart from herself. This is a woman’s nature. Go. Greetings. We had taken an appointment earlier. Mr. Qasim is absolutely fine. Today, we will keep him under observation
 for one day. Sure. and he will get discharged tomorrow. Thank you so much doctor. 
Don’t worry. Thank you. 
Thank you. Did you check on all the medication? Yes, sir, I will give it timely. Absolutely right, till I don’t come back, you please don’t go anywhere from here. Yes, sir, sure. Don’t worry. Thank you. 
Thank you, sir. Will I have to invite you to come along?
Come on. I am fine here. I will stay with uncle, 
I will take care of him. And I am fine, I am not tired,
I am completely fresh. I am waiting for you in the car, 
come quickly. I don’t know where this boy is. He stays where he goes. Mama. Hey, where were you? I have been 
waiting for you for so long. Listen to me, I just saw Ramsha here. What? Ramsha? Sister in law? Here? 
Where? Elder mama was not with her, 
she was alone. She sat in a big car and left. Okay. Let’s go home. Will you eat something? Why are you not responding? Tell me, 
will you eat something or not? Why did you stop the car? Ramsha, you stayed with dad all night long, you were taking care of him. Obviously, you wouldn’t have gotten
a chance to eat anything, so let’s eat something. I am not hungry, I want to go home. But I am really hungry. I didn’t have breakfast in my hurry
to get to the hospital. Now I will eat something.
Come on. Come. Come on, come on, 
we will sit and eat. You will like it. Come on. It is evening, if you want I can order it 
for you, you can eat it. No, I am not hungry. What do you mean you are not hungry? Even in restaurant I ordered 
things you liked, but you didn’t eat anything. Is all okay? You remember even today? There are some things a person 
doesn’t forget all their lives. Really? I had heard that a person only remember
things that are important for them. According to you, I was never 
important for you, Afnan. Anyway, it makes no difference to me now. Yes, I can see it makes no difference to you. You seem really satisfied now. I have learned to be thankful for 
what God has given me. And I have stopped running 
after the things, that I couldn’t get. No Shani, I think you surely have a misunderstanding, that girl must be someone else, 
and not Ramsha. I have no misunderstanding mama, I recognize her well. How is it possible? I mean, you make her stand in a crowd
of millions and not just thousands, I will recognize her. Hey, if it was Ramsha, then elder mama would be there as well,
why would she be alone? Is elder mama with her everywhere? Hospital is not a place for outing, brother. She must have surely gone to 
get elder mama’s check up done. But you said that she went alone 
with someone in the car. I don’t know. I just know that elder mama was not with her. I was sure, I had said it earlier. I had a doubt. In fact, not a doubt, I was sure, sister in law is hiding somewhere
 in this city along with Ramsha. Now you will see, how suddenly someday, she will come to this home 
with the police. What is the problem, papa? 
Nothing like this will happen. If they had to do something like this,
 then they would have done it and the police would have come 
to our home. You and I wouldn’t have been home,
we would be in jail. Yes, I think Shani is absolutely right. Okay fine, in a way this is good. At least we found out that 
where our beloved sister in law, our beloved niece are. Now we will have no difficulty 
in finding them. It is good. Hello. Yes. Mama, but elder mama had said she would 
take Ramsha away from this city, but she is here. If she is here, then where is she? And if papa finds out, then? They have not given the details 
in the contract. Yes, you email me. I will see. Afnan, what is this nonsense?
Really? And where were the manners in 
leaving dad with Ramsha. No, Ramsha told me herself that 
she will stay with uncle. That is why I came home, 
what is there to be so worried in this? Ramsha told you and you accepted 
what she said? Oh wow, great. I cannot believe that you can leave dad
with a stranger. Come on, Afnan, she eats in our home, 
lives with luxuries, at that time she is not a stranger. And after all, uncle doesn’t consider her
 a stranger. If he considers her his niece, then let her 
fulfill her responsibility a little. What are you doing? Why are you not 
accepting your mistake? You are making noise for no reason, Afnan. So what if I left her there? She knows uncle’s entire schedule, 
his medication, in fact, I did good. You know what the issue with 
people like you is? You people think that you are right
in every matter, you make no mistakes. And then these mistakes become 
a problem for others. Okay, Afnan, leave it, why are you arguing
 for no reason? Uncle is unwell anyway. I am going to have breakfast, 
you too come alone, we will have tea. There is no need. I don’t have so much time, 
I have to reach dad and after all this is lunch time, when you are having your breakfast. I hope you will be quick or you will have 
to eat lunch with dinner. What is the problem, Afnan? You never acknowledge 
any effort of mine. I took an off cause of uncle and 
you don’t see anything. You didn’t take an off cause of dad, you took an off to sleep, 
and you did that. Yes, so what? 
If I slept a little extra. I had an off, I slept, 
what is wrong in this? You are impossible. Hey, dad, one minute. 
One minute. What?
Something looks incomplete. This is for your signature look. Come on. Come on. Lets go, and what is the need for this wheel chair? 
I am fine, I can walk and go. Dad, what is wrong with you? This is a really big problem of yours. As soon as you feel a little healthy, you start behaving like superman. The one who has a capable and 
obedient son like you, even if he gets unwell and old, their emotions
 stay young like superman. Brother take this wheel chair, and where is doctor Umar, 
I have to meet him. Sir Dr. Umar would be 
in the OPD right now. Fine, dad you have a seat. As soon as he gets free from the OPD,
then send him here. No, no need to worry him.
I will go and thank him myself. The way he took care of me, 
and I don’t thank him, it wont look good. Come on, 
we will go ourselves. Dad, he just did his duty. 
That it. Son, if he did his duty, 
then it is also our duty to thank him from the bottom of 
our heart. Okay, come on, sit. Okay, come on, we will go. 
I am fine. You don’t listen to me. Even in restaurant I ordered 
things you liked, but you didn’t eat anything. Is all okay? You remember even today? There are some things a person 
doesn’t forget all their lives. Really? I had heard that a person only remember 
things that are important for them. According to you, I was never important 
for you, Afnan. I can see it makes no difference to you. You seem really satisfied now. I have learned to be thankful for 
what God has given me. And I have stopped running 
after the things, that I couldn’t get. Alizay. Alizay. 
Yes? I don’t know, my heart is restless. Because of dad’s health… I am going to dad’s room 
to ask how he is. Yes, go.
