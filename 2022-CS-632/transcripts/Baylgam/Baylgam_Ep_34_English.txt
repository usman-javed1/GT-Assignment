Greetings. Greetings. Hey wow, uncle, you went shopping. Yes, I had to get some things of need,
that’s it. Tabassum, call madam Ramsha. Okay, sure. Hey, come. Come. Greetings. Child, I brought some clothes and
things of need for you. Hey, uncle, there is no need for that,
you are worried for me for no reason. Hey, what is there to worry in this, child? And don’t call me uncle, be a little informal with me. I have made your mother, my sister. Fine, I will try uncle. Hey, you are being formal again. Fine, uncle. Live long. Live long. See if you like the things. I feel that uncle has found
his lost daughter. You know brother, he is empathetic with people like this. Mama, I don’t know anything, you call and ask Afnan to come back. He will handle this situation. Hey, you will worry Afnan for something
so small? He anyway went for work, I don’t think you should disturb him. Okay tell me, what problem
do you have that girl? Why? Don’t you have a problem with that girl? I have a problem, but not that much that I put myself
in a problem because of her. Alizeh, her mother is unwell. When she gets fine,
she will leave from here. Mama, her mother is in a coma, and you don’t know how long it takes
a person to recover from a coma. Some people take days, some months
and some even take years. I know brother has loved you
so much from the start and he has always given you value. Now you are unable to tolerate that
he gives value to someone else in your place, that is why you are getting so hyper. Mama, I don’t know all this. But I don’t like that someone else
calls uncle, uncle apart from me. My love, he is your uncle and
he will stay that way. If brother has made that woman
her sister out of sympathy so what is wrong in that? Come on. Uncle, can I sit with you here? Sit. Greetings.
Greetings. Uncle, you offer Namaz, please pray to God for me. Fine, I will pray for you too. Tell me, do you want me to pray
about something special. Pray to God that he gives me peace. You want peace? Hearts find peace with the mention of God. You mention God, talk to Him. You will see, you will also find peace and
happiness too. I have seen you pray regularly. You don’t miss a single prayer, right? I try, child. It is His order. It is a way to remember him. You have to try to fulfill God’s orders, but remember one thing, you can delay prayers but not service. He forgives the rights of God,
He is the most forgiving, but there is a lot of questioning
in the matters of His creation. You need to be really careful
in these matters, rest, he is really forgiving.
The most forgiving. He loves us more than
seventy mothers. You are right. I will follow it. A man just makes intentions, God gives them the will.
Everything gets fine. Yes. I think you really like flowers. Hey, yes, I love every creation of God, but my son really likes
these flowers and gardening. You have a son too? Yes, he has gone to Islamabad
for business. He will be back in a day or two. Did you talk to the doctor? Yes, God cures,
may He give her health. You pray. If you pray with your heart,
God will hear it. She is my sister,
may God give her health. Don’t worry. If your heart is feeling sad,
then call out to Him. He listens, He knows it all. He lives in the heart. Talk to him about what is in your heart, He listens. He listens to everyone. What? But uncle had told me that he will take me
to the hospital, then how did he go? Hey, why are you constantly
calling him uncle? Relations are only made in blood. If someone makes someone
their niece, or sister, in name, then
it doesn’t become true. This home is a stranger’s home for you, are you a stranger here.
Remember that. It is better that you stay in your room
and stay limited to it. When brother comes,
I will tell you. Now go from here. Aunt. How are you? Yes, I am absolutely fine, but who was this girl.
It was not Alizeh. This is the problem brother
brought to this home. Hey, how can you bring anyone
from the streets home? I mean, what do we know
what family this girl belongs to? Who is she? But who makes brother understand this? Dad gets in trouble
cause of his niceness. No, tell me yourself, how is it possible that this girl
doesn’t have a family. She must have someone,
some maternal or paternal uncle, some cousin, not everyone can die.
Think about it yourself. Aunt, don’t worry, I will talk to dad. I am too much. You just came from
a journey and I started. You must think that aunt… you get fresh,
I will have food served. Fine. Aunt, where is Alizeh? She is in the office, anyway, she should be here by now. You call her, she will come
quicker seeing your call. Fine. What happened madam Ramsha?
What are you looking at? Nothing, whose car has come downstairs?
Did someone come? Little master was going to come,
he must have come. Fine, you leave. Madam Ramsha.
Yes? Did you talk to elder sir? No, I went to talk,
he is sitting with someone. No issues, it must be little master,
you would have gone. It is okay, I will go talk to him later. It didn’t feel
right to disturb him right now. Hey. There are no power failures here,
so what happened now? I will find out. Tabassum. Tabassum. Hey Bashir. What happened?
I am sorry. Did you get hurt. No, that… It was really dark. Ramsha, you? Afnan. What are you doing here? There was a power failure,
so I went to get a candle. I had told you to stay in your room. Now the light is here, leave. Sure. Aunt, who was this? Hey, this is the same girl brother
brought home, you make her understand one thing,
but she doesn’t understand. You. This is my car. I think you were trying
 to unlock the door. I dressed up for you. Really? But I never asked you to 
dress up so much? Hey, I thought I would dress 
up for you, you would like it. Hey, you don’t look good at all. You know your beauty is in 
your innocence, in your simplicity. Your innocence… stay the same, don’t wear such a heavy 
dress and make up. Fine, I will be careful next time. Afnan, mama and papa are 
looking for a proposal for me. That is why I have told 
mama the truth about us. And mama wants that you
 come with a proposal for me with your family. Really? So you want that my family comes to your home and ask for your proposal? After today, the two of us wont 
keep any relation with each other. I made a mistake, I helped you. It is all my fault. That’s it. I am sorry, I cannot live with this burden. So I am going. No Afnan, don’t do this, I love you and I told mama and came to meet you. I want to marry you. You love me, I love you… Just shut up! Hey, you had left your 
parents and come. You didn’t care 
about their respect, then how will you 
care about my respect? Someone who couldn’t 
be their parents, they can never be mine. You don’t know the importance 
of relations, Ramsha. If you care about anything
 it is about you, your happiness, and I… and yes, you were saying, I came out of sympathy, 
I didn’t come because of love. I sympathized with you, 
and came to help you so that you can take your 
remaining respect and go home. But I didn’t know you would 
come as a torment on my head. Lets forget what happened, and remember one thing, you and I cannot get married, that is why don’t call me after today. We will not meet. Take care of yourself. Bye. What is happening with me? Whatever path I take 
I meet this person. Why is this happening? Why is this happening? Madam Ramsha, I have washed 
your clothes, should I bring them? Listen to me. Will you tell me something? This Afnan, what is his relation with this family. I mean, what is his relation with uncle? Madam, what are you saying? What is his relation? Mr Afnan is Mr. Qasim’s only son, this is his home. Son? This home belongs to Afnan. Yes, all okay, madam? Did Mr. Afnan say something to you? You look worried. No. Nothing. He said nothing. Everything is fine. Don’t worry because of Mr. Afnan, you are worrying for no reason. I have been working 
here for a long time, little master has a good demeanor, and why wouldn’t he be?
 Elder master brought him up. The men of this home are really good. That is why my grandmother
 worked here, then my mother and now I am working. Even if I get unwell, these people give me an off. Madam Ramsha, you don’t worry. These people may be strangers, but you are safe here. Fine, you leave. What have you come to do here? Tell me honestly, you came to take revenge
 with me, right? There is nothing like that, Afnan. Stop this nonsense. I know all this scheming of yours. All of this happening by
 planning and this accident was also part of the plan,
 it was part of it. Have you lost your mind? I had told you there is nothing 
like that, go from here. Lower your voice. This is my home, not yours.
 Do you understand. And I will never let this plan of 
yours to destroy me be successful. Hey you even used 
your mother to get me. I have not seen anyone 
cheap like you. You are cheap, not me. You must have used your parents
 to your advantage, I didn’t. I am so sorry. What is the problem? Do you have your eyes
 closed when walking? Sorry. and why do you roam 
around the home all day long? Can you not sit peacefully
 in your room? What did you think? This home has been
 put in your name? if uncle has brought you 
here out of sympathy, it doesn’t mean that you consider
 this home your ownership. It is a luxury, don’t get used to it. I don’t know when her 
mother will get better and she will leave from here. Now what are you staring at me for? 
Go from here. Ill-mannered, illiterate girl. What has happened child? Tell me. I want to go to mama, right now. I am really restless, please take me to my mama. Yes, so what is there
 to cry about in this? I will take you to the 
hospital in the morning. You go to your room and rest, we will go in the morning. Okay? Can I sleep here? Here? I am scared alone in my room, my heart is really restless. You don’t worry, I will put 
a sheet on the ground and sleep. No, no, child, this 
is not reasonable. You do one thing, sit here. Sit. Sit. I will do something, okay? Alizay, brother is saying that you let Ramsha sleep 
in your room for one night. I think she saw a bad dream, so she is unable to sleep in her room. What do you mean, mama? Is she a child, that she saw a bad dream, and now she is scared,
 so make her sleep in my room. Not at all. Sorry. Say no to uncle. Alizay, it is just about one night. No, no, aunty,
 what is wrong with you? How can you think this? You know Alizay well. Alizay cannot share 
her room with anyone. This is not right. Hey, Afnan, so you tell me, 
what should I do? Tabassum hasn’t come either, had she come, I would have made her
 sleep in Ramsha’s room. Mama, my privacy 
gets disturbed. I am sorry, I cannot sleep 
with someone else. I can also make her 
sleep in my room, but, you know I will be 
restless all night. I cannot guard 
that girl all night. I don’t trust that girl at all. What is the issue, mama? What is this? First uncle brought her home, he gave her a separate room and now you want
 she sleeps in my room. This is not possible. No. Alizay. Mama… Come in. Where are you going? Go lie down over there. Will you sleep here? And listen to me, I don’t like someone else 
touching anything I have. Okay? Be careful, don’t 
touch anything of mine. Don’t worry, wherever you have things kept,
 they will remain there. I will not bother you. Afnan. Why are you not coming 
to have breakfast? I just didn’t feel like it. I was thinking that did that girl who stayed in your room at night, did she say something weird? Did she bother you? What will she say to me? No, you know, I couldn’t sleep all
 night cause of this. So she was with me, why were you not able to sleep? What are you worried about? No, no, why would I have any worry? I was just think that you had told me that the girl will share the room with you. What is her name? Ramsha. Ramsha. She will share 
a room with you, you will get disturbed, that’s why. Why are you so worried, Afnan? Hey, why would I not get worried? Are you and I separate? If you get disturbed, then I will also be disturbed. Come on, Afnan, I feel you have given way too 
much importance to that girl. Yes. Nothing had happened. I feel all of us are thinking too much, that girl is not a thief. Look, if she was a thief, then something would have been
 stolen from the home till now. But that didn’t happen. So leave her, come on, let’s go 
have breakfast. Yes, come on. Okay? Come on. Uncle you know, today I felt that mama 
smiled seeing me. Really? You too felt that? What do you mean I too felt that? I too felt that sister Mehnaz smiled. This means it 
was not my imagination. Mama was really smiling. Do you know? All my worries ended
 seeing mama’s smile. I have peace in my heart or else I was so worried, I felt that my heart will stop. I will run away somewhere 
from your home. What happened child? Did someone say something to you? No. You are hiding something. Or else, why would the
 heart feel this way? Tell me, did Afsheen
 say something or Alizay? No uncle, there is nothing like that. Don’t worry. Do you trust me? Yes, but what sort of a question is this? If I tell you something, 
then will you believe me? Yes, child, why wont I believe you?
