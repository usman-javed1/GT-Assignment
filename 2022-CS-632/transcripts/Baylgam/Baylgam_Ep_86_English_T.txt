[26.56] It means if Tabassum didn’t 
tell you anything,
[30.24] you would have never trusted me?
[36.20] No, it’s not that, 
why are you saying this?
[42.04] I will say this,
[44.16] I will exactly say this.
[52.12] You have caused me 
so much pain Afnan,
[61.16] I have gone through so many troubles.
[70.32] Look I know you had to bear
a lot of trouble because of me
[84.40] but now I promise you
[87.88] that I will never let tears come 
in your eyes ever.
[112.28] What happened?
[113.92] Why are you quiet?
[116.76] You married me because 
you found out I was innocent
[129.24] so that you can give me support.
[132.00] No,
[133.96] not at all.
[143.36] The truth is that
[147.24] I love you, Ramsha,
[158.60] I love you a lot.
[169.20] The truth is that
[172.44] my false got defeated in front of 
my true love.
[189.28] Do you know
[193.20] when I was hooking you up
with Adeel,
[198.72] I was punishing myself by providing you 
with protection,
[210.64] punishment because 
I was unable to protect you,
[227.76] if you had actually married Adeel,
[234.56] I would have died alive.
[266.08] Why are you looking at me like this?
[273.40] I am looking at
[276.48] the fact that the dream I had at some 
point about my relationship with you,
[281.64] My God will fulfill that dream 
in a few moments,
[297.04] I couldn’t have even imagined that 
you will become my fate, Afnan.
[318.40] Why are you crying so much?
[323.48] It is not the time to cry.
[332.68] I am not crying,
[334.76] these are the tears of joy.
[344.32] I am happy.
[347.00] Every moment of our life
[353.32] will be filled with happiness and 
smiles from now onwards,
[367.48] there won’t be sorrows at all.
[463.88] Afnan,
[465.88] where were you? 
You came back so late.
[469.76] Yes,
[471.44] there was a lot of traffic 
so I got stuck.
[474.16] You go to sleep.
[476.20] Okay.
[501.08] I wanted to tell you something,
[503.64] madam Afsheen fired me 
from my job.
[507.16] Why did she fire you?
[508.52] Actually, she was afraid that 
I might tell you the truth.
[512.32] What are you saying, Tabassum? 
Tell me properly.
[519.12] Look at this.
[523.92] Don’t you remember how much money
I have spent to get her kidnapped,
[527.56] we have taken such a huge risk.
[532.36] Mom, I feel all our efforts 
will go to waste.
[535.80] Whatever you have done 
will go to waste.
[551.64] Kill me
[553.96] but I won’t marry you.
[557.68] I can’t kill you even if I want to.
[560.32] But if you don’t listen to me,
[564.92] I will definitely kill myself.
[567.16] No.
[568.64] Tell me should I kill myself?
[571.28] Okay, you won’t say like this,
[573.96] I will only count till 3, Ramsha,
[579.84] 1
[582.96] 2
[585.84] I am ready.
[670.76] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[672.60] What happened? You seem to be
in a rush today.
[675.28] No, no,
[676.48] why would I be in a rush? 
I am getting ready like usual.
[679.64] I see you getting ready daily
[681.68] but you are getting ready 
so much rush today.
[687.36] Is everything okay?
[689.80] Umm yes actually, 
today Mr Ahmed,
[695.36] you know Mr Ahmed, 
he is our very old employee,
[698.36] he has scheduled a very important 
and urgent meeting today,
[706.40] so I just don’t want to get late for it.
[709.28] Mr Ahmed works under you, 
you are his boss,
[718.16] even if you get late, 
he won’t scold you.
[720.96] Yes but professionally ethically
it is not right, he is an elder,
[724.68] I have to take care of his respect.
 Bye.
[726.72] Hey, take your bag.
[728.52] Oh sorry.
[731.20] Thank you. Bye. 
Bye.
[748.32] I don’t know why Afnan has left 
for the office in such a rush today,
[756.76] he didn’t even have breakfast.
[761.36] His behavior seemed fishy too.
[766.88] There is definitely some problem.
[794.52] What kind of a wife are you, Alizey?
[796.88] You don’t know anything about 
what your husband is thinking,
[800.00] what is going on in his heart? 
Why is he worried,
[803.00] show some interest.
[806.52] So what should I do, Mom?
[808.48] If Afnan doesn’t want to share 
anything with me, what is my fault in it?
[812.20] Why are you blaming me for it?
[814.00] Because you are his wife
[815.72] and still you guys have so much 
distance in between,
[818.16] because you never took interest,
[820.12] you just care about your career, 
your lifestyle,
[822.72] you just focus on yourself.
[824.48] Have you ever focused 
on your husband?
[827.00] Because you don’t care.
[884.56] Umm...
[886.60] this is my car
[889.16] I guess you were trying 
to open the door.
[893.00] Umm I'm sorry.
[917.64] Ramsha.
[922.48] Afnan.
[925.48] Sit down.
[926.64] Umm hand.
[928.08] Sorry.
[936.80] Hey listen,
[938.84] where did you get these bangles from?
They are very nice.
[941.20] They are crystal.
[942.88] What if they are crystal,
they do look nice.
[946.04] It’s amazing, who likes crystal 
bangles anyway? You like them.
[949.36] I really like bangles in girls’ hands
[952.28] but they look really special 
in your hands.
[956.32] Thank you,
[957.20] I will wear bangles daily 
from now on.
[1019.68] I am here now,
[1021.84] everything will be fine.
[1096.76] I don’t know what I would have 
done hadn’t you come,
[1099.16] they were, they were about to do
something very wrong with me.
[1101.60] Ramsha?
[1103.76] How would I not come?
[1108.20] It was you?
[1110.36] I had to come for you at any cost
[1116.00] and I know very well that 
you haven’t done anything,
[1119.24] you are being framed in this matter
[1124.04] but I am with you Ramsha,
[1127.52] I won’t leave your side 
in this difficult time.
[1365.56] Greetings.
[1368.56] How are you?
[1370.20] Greetings.
[1371.84] you got so late.
[1373.32] Hey I have put my life in danger
and come here,
[1381.52] you know how?
[1382.56] Not by driving the car 
but I flew it instead.
[1387.00] I even told you to come soon as
 I am hungry.
[1396.08] Even the breakfast has gotten cold now.
[1399.04] So you should have had breakfast.
[1401.32] It was our first breakfast after marriage,
[1410.72] I should have had it alone?
[1413.48] I am so sorry
[1421.44] but do you know I got done with 
my breakfast as soon as I saw you.
[1424.24] You look so beautiful.
[1426.40] Stop the drama, 
come have breakfast.
[1428.44] No, sit for a while.
[1438.64] You have dressed up so well,
[1441.40] I just want to save you in my eyes.
[1553.80] Afnan, are you going somewhere?
[1557.44] No
[1560.12] I was just checking time on the phone.
[1563.92] Keep the phone down and sleep.
[1568.56] Hmm.
[1585.20] Listen,
[1586.60] switch off this light, please.
[1590.44] Okay.
[1626.20] the dream I had at some point 
about my relationship with you,
[1631.36] My God will fulfill that dream 
in a few moments,
[1643.52] I couldn’t have even imagined that 
you will become my fate, Afnan.
[1649.60] Why are you crying so much?
[1654.80] It is not the time to cry.
[1662.72] I am not crying,
[1664.92] these are the tears of joy.
[1679.44] Last night, I tried a lot to call you
[1683.64] but I didn’t get a chance
[1686.32] and I didn’t want Alizey to have 
any sort of doubt.
[1690.92] Yes, but I waited for you all night.
[1697.28] Yes, I know
[1703.68] but trust me, I have come to 
meet you directly from the office.
[1717.68] Even I wanted to meet you 
as soon as possible.
[1728.36] I had a lot of important meetings 
but I said no,
[1731.36] I will first go and meet my Ramsha
[1734.32] then we will decide something.
[1737.92] Hey what are you doing, no.
[1739.60] What happened, Afnan?
[1740.76] I don’t like that you touch 
my shoes like this.
[1744.88] Really?
[1747.24] But I would really like it 
if I do all your work.
[1757.44] Do you know, Afnan,
[1760.44] I really wanted to do all your work,
[1770.00] I am your wife anyway and 
you have the most right on me.
[1789.08] Why are you looking at me like this?
[1793.36] I was thinking that there is so much
difference between you and Alizey.
[1799.96] Afnan, the difference is not between 
me and Alizey,
[1809.20] it is between our knowledge.
[1812.00] What does that mean?
[1815.36] I mean that
[1817.32] I am way behind Alizey when it comes
to worldly education
[1829.04] but I have learned the knowledge 
of religion,
[1843.16] our religion teaches us that if a wife 
will make her husband the King of the house,
[1848.00] her own position will be of a queen.
[1852.64] I am so lucky to have a 
religious wife like you.
[1871.40] Okay now go freshen up 
and I will serve food for you.
[1879.88] yes, I don’t know you will just 
stay here today.
[1882.32] Ramsha, please
[1883.80] I can’t stay, try and understand, 
I have a problem.
[1887.08] I don’t want to understand anything, 
Afnan,
[1889.60] I will get upset with you 
if you don’t stay here today.
[1893.28] Ramsha, look now,
[1895.40] look now you are threatening me.
[1897.68] Now it’s up to you if you consider this
a threat or my love.
[1901.20] Dude, what dude?
[1904.92] You are acting very selfishly.
[1907.60] A person does become selfish in love 
sometimes and there is nothing wrong with it.
[1911.76] Ramsha, look please try 
to understand me,
[1914.88] I will get into huge trouble 
if I stay here today.
[1918.04] Really?
[1919.68] Okay then you go to your home
[1921.88] but if I actually get mad at you
 for real after this,
[1924.68] then I will never talk to you.
[1926.28] Okay, okay, I won’t go, 
I will try to stay here.
[1929.08] You don’t have to try, you have to 
stay here today Afnan.
[1931.48] Okay I will stay.
[1935.64] Thank you. 
You’re welcome.
[1951.64] Afnan, you didn’t tell me that you are
going to Islamabad like this all of a sudden?
[1963.36] You didn’t even tell me that 
you have a meeting
[1969.32] and you are going for 2 3 days.
[1971.32] Hey, the meeting was scheduled 
a long time ago I forgot to tell you.
[1981.76] And the Islamabad office has been
ignored for a long time as well,
[1984.96] I thought of giving two days there,
[1995.24] so it will take me 2 to 3 days.
[1999.24] Okay.
[2002.96] Why are you getting worried?
[2012.60] I will try to come back in 2 to 3 days 
and don’t delay it any further.
[2016.40] Okay. 
Okay I am leaving,
[2018.48] it’s almost time for my flight.
[2019.76] Why are you driving yourself, 
ask the driver to drop you at the airport.
[2029.44] I am not going myself,
[2034.92] I am asking Jamshed to drop me 
at the airport and bring the car back.
[2039.76] okay.
[2041.52] Uh, I am getting a call. 
Take care. Hello?
[2056.64] What happened? You seem to be
in a rush today.
[2059.28] No, no,
[2060.52] why would I be in a rush? 
I am getting ready like usual.
[2063.68] I see you getting ready daily
[2065.92] but you are getting ready 
so much rush today.
[2068.04] Is everything okay?
[2069.88] Umm yes actually, 
today Mr Ahmed,
[2073.32] you know Mr Ahmed, 
he is our very old employee,
[2076.08] he has scheduled a very important 
and urgent meeting today,
[2079.68] so I just don’t want to get late for it.
[2082.56] Mr Ahmed works under you, 
you are his boss,
[2085.40] even if you get late, 
he won’t scold you.
[2088.20] Yes but professionally ethically 
it is not right, he is an elder,
[2091.96] and I have to take care of his respect. 
Bye.
[2094.04] Hey, take your bag.
[2095.80] Oh sorry.
[2098.56] Thank you. Bye.
[2160.36] What was the need to bring 
such a big bag?
[2164.24] I was thinking that
[2168.76] I am here for 3 days
[2173.24] but if the days extend,
[2176.68] I should at least have clothes.
[2178.48] You tell me do you need anything?
[2182.08] No thank you.
[2187.88] Wait a minute.
[2191.36] Yes, greetings, yes, absolutely fine 
by the grace of God.
[2195.44] Umm Yes Mr Balaj, 
do one thing deliver the car
[2199.52] to the same address 
that I have sent you.
[2203.68] Yes, I will also send you 
the pin location
[2205.60] but it shouldn’t go to 
any wrong address.
[2221.20] Thank you so much. Thanks.
[2229.40] Congratulations Miss,
[2233.80] your new car is coming tomorrow,
[2235.88] I have ordered a car for you.
[2242.36] What?
