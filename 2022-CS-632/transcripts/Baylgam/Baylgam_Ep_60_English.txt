What did you say to Ramsha? She complained to you about me. I am asking you what 
you said to Ramsha? it is not possible that she didn’t tell you what 
I said to her. She told me nothing. Really? She didn’t tell you anything and you are getting 
so upset with me. If she had told you something, then God knows what you 
would have done. Don’t change the topic and don’t think useless things, tell me what did you say to her? I didn’t expect this from an 
educated girl like you that the girl who is in this condition, you will treat her like this. I am disappointed Afnan, that you are worried for a stranger’s 
sorrow and pain, instead of your wife. You worry about her. Then you say that I doubt you. For God’s sake, there is nothing between
 me and Ramsha, stop doubting us. Had I known before marriage that you had an affair with her, then I would never
 have married you. I am not mad Afnan, you have created this doubt
 for me in your heart. The hard work and effort you are putting it in doubting 
me and Ramsha, had you put 25% of that effort 
on our relationship, then today, you too wouldn’t
 be in this torture today and my life would
 have been at peace. You are putting in the effort 
at the wrong place, and only the two of us will 
face the consequences of it. I feel you started serving Ramsha as
 soon as you came from the office. You didn’t even change 
your clothes. Yes, I didn’t change. I didn’t get the chance. I found out Ramsha is unwell, so I came here to ask how she is. You are really worried for Ramsha. What do you mean?
 What do you want to say? That you never cared so 
much for me, Afnan. You are not in this condition either. And even if I came and asked her 
how she was in this condition, then no hell broke loose. Thank God, Ramsha didn’t tell 
brother anything. You know the difficulty with which 
brother stopped her from going. She didn’t say anything to uncle, but yes, she complained to
 Afnan about me. That’s why he came to fight with me. I cannot believe this. If Ramsha had to complain, she would have told brother, why Afnan? Then why was he fighting me? Has he gone mad? Afnan has not gone mad, 
you have that you fight with Afnan for no reason. Hey Afnan must have 
guessed and talked. He must have felt that you 
said something to Ramsha, that is why Ramsha is insistent 
on going home. Look Alizay, now I don’t want that brother has 
a complaint from you for no reason. Mama, uncle anyway has 
a complaint from me all the time. Yes, so he should
 also complain. You don’t care about Afnan, nor any responsibility 
of the home, neither do you care about brother. Being the daughter
 in law of this home, what responsibilities 
have you taken up? Hey, it is brother’s greatness that 
he doesn’t say anything to you and he is lenient to you. Look, brother has made Ramsha
 his daughter and Alizay if you 
ask me honestly, then Ramsha has proved 
herself to be his daughter. She really cares for brother. Are you not getting late? Aunt Bina must be waiting for you. I am late, but now I would want that you 
too come along with me. She will be really happy 
when she sees you. Mama, please, I don’t 
want to go anywhere, I am really tired. That’s it. That’s your problem. You only do what you want to. Hey, bring some change in yourself, bring in some flexibility. Okay fine, I will come with you. That’s what I am talking about. Go and get ready. thank God you are much
 better than before. This means you are taking your 
medication on time. You have guessed it right. The credit of this goes to Ramsha. She has got me in the habit of
 taking my medication regularly. When the child comes home, I am at peace. May God give her a good fate. May He bless her with faith, 
health and good health. Dad I need to take this call. Yes, close the door and 
switch off the light. I too will rest a little. Yes. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hello. Greetings. Greetings. Who? This is Annie, Ramsha’s cousin. I think you are Afnan. Yes, yes, this is Afnan. You tell me, all okay? I want to talk to Ramsha. Actually, I have been calling 
her for a long time, but I think her number is off. It is her birthday today, I want to wish her. 
Will you let me talk to her? Today is Ramsha’s birthday. yes, is it 12 am, and from the start I used to wish her first. So let me talk to her. Yes, yes, I will make you 
talk to her immediately, but before that can you 
agree to something? Where were you Shani? I called out to you so many times. The tea even got cold, I have heated it again. What were you doing? Mama, I don’t understand. Since Ramsha went, I am 
unable to find my things. It doesn’t take me so long
 to get ready,that it takes me to find the things. See, when Ramsha was there, she would keep everything 
safely and in its place, and you? You just throw things around, if you look for them, 
how will you find out. Mama, you know you are right. If she was there, then 
I had no such tension. mama. Mama. Yes? Mr. Qasim is calling. Mr. Qasim? On my phone. Answer it. He didn’t tell me anything, he is just telling me to
 let him talk to you. Hello. Tabassum. Tabassum. Where is everyone? Surprise. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Ramsha. Happy birthday to you. Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you so much. What is all this? You people scared me. Brother Shani did all this. Yes, but it was her idea. Wow. But when did
 you people plan this? Uncle Qasim called, he said he wants to
 celebrate your birthday. And along with it,
 we will have a get together and spend good time together. You did good that 
you people came. I was really missing you all. Brother has decorated it so well and uncle Qasim really
 loves you like a daughter. See ,he did so much for you. Yes, uncle really loves me a lot. I think we should cut the cake now. Yes, Afnan, aunt and
 Alizay are not here. If they were with us, 
we would have had fun. Please, call them. Yes, I too wanted this but I called them a lot, none of them is answering it. I think they are in a gathering. I will call again. Fine, try again. If they are here, 
it will look nice. Yes, you people enjoy. Okay tell me, how did you 
like the surprise? you look really happy. Yes, Alizay, I am happy. You see, everyone has done 
so much for me. Seeing this I realize everyone 
really loves me a lot. I don’t know about everyone, but yes, Afnan really loves you a lot. Alizay, what nonsense is this? Is this something you
 should be saying? I am so sorry, Ramsha. You know Alizay well, she speaks without thinking. What is so wrong
 in what I said? I am right. All this is your love that 
we see here today. Stop it Alizay. If you say another word, 
it will not be good. Be quiet. You are making me be quiet? I am not mad. I can see everything clearly, I am your wife. I understand the drama going 
on between you two here. What do you think? I cannot see. Is she your wife that you 
are creating this drama? Alizay. Afnan. What are you doing? You were going to raise 
your hand at me? Hit me, why did you stop? You were going to raise your 
hand at me for this girl? What is going on? Mama. Mama. Mama. Afnan was 
raising his hand at me. Afnan… what is this I hear? Aunt, I can explain this to you. Alizay was misbehaving a lot, I did raise my hand, but I didn’t hit her. Afnan, don’t fool everyone here. I am your wife, I understand 
what you are doing. Alizay, enough. Enough. Please
 don’t create a scene. I created a scene? 
What is all this? Stop it Alizay. Don’t create a scene. Come to the room, we will talk. I don’t want to talk to
 him about anything. I saw everything with my eyes. Dad, you are scolding
 me for no reason. Although, it is all Alizay’s fault. Whatever it is, you shouldn’t raise your 
hand at her. I didn’t raise my hand at her, dad. If she is saying this, then 
she is lying to you. Lower your voice with me. Okay dad, I am really sorry, I raised my voice, but I am getting frustrated. Every time, Alizay 
complains about me and you start scolding me. Although, it is all her fault, 
it is always her mistake. Look, if you had a complaint 
from Alizay, you should have said it to me. How could I say it, dad? I will talk when she gives 
me a chance to talk. You don’t know what dirty things 
she said about me and Ramsha. It was my courage 
that I tolerated it. If you were there in
 my place dad, then you wouldn’t have 
been able to tolerate it. You would have slapped her. You are not trusting me, I am tired of making
 everyone understand. I don’t know what is going
 on in this home. Now like the rest, you too 
please don’t scold me. After all, the entire 
family thinks that I am wrong in everything. You are not wrong, but your method is wrong. If Alizay doesn’t like you 
doing anything for me, then why are you doing it? She said so much to you and you are taking her side. I am not taking her side, I am just supporting what is the truth. and what is right? Please also tell me, because I don’t know. Alizay is your wife, Afnan. She has the most right on you. Her likes and dislikes are things you will
 have to be careful about. If she doesn’t like you 
doing anything for me, then don’t do anything. If I was in Alizay’s place, I too would have had
 the same reacting. If you were in her place, then this 
would never have happened. Because you are not selfish like her, you are not envious. You are not jealous of the 
happiness of others Believe me, Alizay started this drama because she is jealous of your happiness. She is jealous of you, and when a person is 
jealous of someone, then they are not able to differentiate
 between right and wrong. You don’t need to make me understand,
 you need to make her understand. Who forced her to be jealous? Are you serious? I can’t believe this. I heard so much from
 Alizay because of you and now you are blaming me? And there Alizay too is blaming me. I am surprised. You cannot do good nowadays. Ramsha? Hello. Greetings. Greetings. How are you? Shani, can you come right now? At this hour? Yes. Ramsha, when I was 
leaving home from today, I asked you to come along, you said no. and now you are suddenly
 saying right now that I come to pick you. Yes, but you just come, Shani. Why? Do you miss me? Do you miss me? And you are not able to
 focus without me? Shani, please come. I want to go home. Hey, how can I come at this hour. I mean, I cannot come to pick 
you up on the bike, it is really late at night. I will come in the morning. No, no, you try and come to get me
 right now somehow. Fine, if I find a car or taxi, then I will come to pick you up. 
And I will tell you. But I cannot take you home 
on the bike at night like this. I will tell you. Okay, goodbye. Goodbye. What is the emergency right now? Shani, you have a seat. 
I will bring my bag. Come quickly, the taxi is waiting outside. Fine. Greetings. Greetings. I came to pick up Ramsha. See, at that time I was asking
 her to come along, she didn’t come then. Now she is suddenly saying 
that I come get her. That’s why I came. I think Ramsha didn’t 
tell you anything. About what? That why is she leaving from 
this home at this time. What do you mean? 
Why is she going? Meaning, I don’t want that she stays in this home
 even for one second. I don’t understand 
why are you saying this? What has happened? Look, no matter how independent 
a woman becomes, as a wife she cannot tolerate that her husband’s ex-lover 
stays in front of her. Why are you looking at me like
 you don’t know anything? Your wife was my husband’s ex-lover. What nonsense is this? This is not the way.
 Please don’t say that. Talk with me with respect. And put your finger
 down when talking. I am telling you the truth, 
that you don’t know. You know, I was waiting for you for a long time. Why did you take so long? Did you not find a car that is
 why you got late? Whose car is this? Did you bring it from that friend 
of yours about whom you… Can you not sit quietly? What is wrong, Shani? Why are you talking like this? Why are you in a bad mood? Did something happen at home? Look, no matter how independent 
a woman becomes, as a wife she cannot tolerate that her husband’s ex-lover 
stays in front of her. Why are you looking at me like
 you don’t know anything? Your wife was my husband’s ex-lover. What nonsense is this? This is not the way. Please don’t say that. Talk with me with respect. And put your finger down when talking. I am telling you the truth, 
that you don’t know. What happened, Shani? You are quiet since you came. You are angry, right? I disturbed you so late at night, you sleep got disturbed too. That is why you are angry at me. Right? You are asking me? Shameless, immodest, disrespectful. What is wrong, Shani? Talk to me with respect. What are you angry about? What am I angry about? I am angry that I am not 
shameless like you. Do you understand? Oh God, what noise is this? It is coming from Shani’s room. Anwar. Yes. Anwar, wake up. Wake up, quickly. Why are you waking me up at this hour? What happened? Hear the noise. It is coming from Shani’s room. They are fighting again. I can even hear the sound of things falling. They are fighting again. Shani, leave me, it hurts. Listen. Shani. Get up and check. Okay. This is a daily occurrence. What are you doing?
 What has happened? I should give you a medal, right? Shani, what has happened? Shani. What is this? what is going on? what is this noise about? What is this? You are a cheater. You cheated me,
 you cheated all of us. What? What is all this? 
What is this noise? What is happening? Being someone else’s lover, 
she married me. Hey you should have married him. What nonsense is this? Are you in your senses? What? Who are you talking about? Who? I am talking about Afnan, who else? Afnan? What nonsense is this? If you don’t believe me, then ask her. She too is involved equally 
in all this. Ask her. Why are you quiet? Answer now. Tell them. What is this? I will not leave her… Shani, remain in your senses. Papa, you stop it. You don’t speak in this matter. The women of your home are
 getting disrespected everywhere, we are not able to face anyone. And Alizay told me this. And you think what 
I would have gone through. I wanted to die right there. Ramsha, what is all this? What is he saying? Tell us. Tell us the truth, what is the matter? Mama, why are you asking her the truth. Ask me, if you want to know the truth. I will tell her if you have the courage. I will kill her alive. Shani, come your senses. Leave me. I am in my senses papa. I am in my senses. Now all of you will see 
what I do to her. Come with me. Leave me. Come on, come with me. I will not leave you. Listen to me. You know Alizay well, she speaks without thinking. What is so wrong in what I said? I am right. All this is your love that 
we see here today. Stop it Alizay. If you say another word, 
it will not be good. Be quiet. You are making me be quiet? I am not mad. I can see everything clearly, I am your wife. I understand the drama going on 
between you two here. What do you think? I cannot see. Is she your wife that you are 
creating this drama? Alizay. Afnan. Child, stop it. Don’t cry like this.
 Come on, don’t cry like this. It is not good for 
your child’s health. You can get unwell as well. You don’t worry, I will talk to Shani. I don’t know what happened
 to that boy suddenly. Okay, don’t cry. Give her water. Drink some water. Come on. no. Have a little. Annie, you sleep with your sister tonight. Yes. and take lots of care of Ramsha. God forbid if she gets unwell or if you feel she is unwell then tell me immediately. Okay? Come on, now close your 
eyes and try to sleep. Switch off the light. Come on. Please, don’t cry Ramsha. I have never seen 
you crying so badly. I cannot see you like this, 
Ramsha. I know you did nothing. You are really good Ramsha, you didn’t commit a sin. You know. You know, I have 
not done anything wrong, You know everything about
 me and Afnan, Annie. We did nothing wrong. I didn’t do anything wrong. I am not bad, Annie. No, you are not a bad girl at all, you are a really good girl, Ramsha. Mama is there. Mama
 will talk to brother. Everything will be fine.
 Everything will be fine.
