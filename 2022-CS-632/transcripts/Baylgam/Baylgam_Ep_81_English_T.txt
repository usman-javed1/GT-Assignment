[24.52] Where are you going?
[26.60] Mama, I was just going to the office.
[29.12] Huh?
[30.52] Don’t you know today is brother’s operation
[37.56] and you are going to the office?
 Are you feeling okay?
[41.40] Yes, mama, I spoke to Afnan actually, 
he said the operation is in the evening.
[45.40] So I thought I would come directly to the office.
[47.32] Alizeh,
[48.64] when you come to the hospital
 to meet brother, it is just for a little while...
[56.80] ...and today is his operation and 
you want to go to the office.
[60.16] Mama, I cannot take more days off.
[63.52] It is necessary to work as well.
[70.72] That’s why I am saying to you that 
I will reach timely, before the operation.
[81.08] Is this not enough.
[82.88] No, this is not enough.
[89.16] Since brother has been admitted to the hospital,
[91.48] Ramsha has made it her second home.
[98.96] She cares for him day and night.
[101.52] She is useless.
[103.48] Whether she makes it her second home or do anything,
 what difference does it make?
[106.68] It makes a difference.
[108.00] But not to Ramsha, to Afnan.
[117.52] If Afnan is quiet it in no way means
 he doesn’t see anything.
[129.64] Alizeh, have you forgotten,
[131.28] how much effort we have put in 
to degrade Ramsha in Afnan’s eyes.
[140.52] You want all of that to go to waste.
[143.76] Mama,
[144.80] I am getting calls from the office. 
Look, I will surely try to come early in the evening.
[148.08] Alizeh.
[149.68] Alizeh.
[168.80] Madam Ramsha, 
Mr. Qasim has his operation today.
[172.56] Yes,
[174.00] that’s why the doctors have said that 
they will stop giving food to uncle in the afternoon.
[178.12] That is why I am quickly making soup, 
so that uncle has at least a little soup.
[183.52] Madam Ramsha, you should have told me.
 I would have made the soup.
[187.20] You know this.
[188.96] Uncle really likes the soup I make.
[191.68] That’s why I came.
[194.08] Listen,
[196.12] the doctors have said that uncle is not well,
[199.36] pray for him.
[201.40] Yes, I surely will.
[208.48] Mr. Qasim cares for everyone.
[217.84] May God give him a long and healthy life.
[220.60] Amen.
[222.36] Amen.
[224.80] Madam Ramsha, you rest a little.
[229.32] I will rest when uncle will be fine.
[239.24] Wow. Wow. Wow.
[242.32] First you made my brother get near to his death
[256.20] and now you want to care for him and 
tell the entire world that you care more for him than us.
[270.52] There is nothing like that.
[278.84] I don’t want to tell anyone anything,
nor do I want to prove it.
[287.76] Whatever I am doing is with my heart.
[297.24] My God knows my intentions.
[299.36] I feel you did all this
 to take revenge from Afnan.
[310.76] Because you couldn’t make your own home,
[320.08] so you thought why should 
I let Alizeh and Afnan make a home.
[333.68] That’s why you gave sorrow, 
pain and suffering to brother.
[347.04] Because of him, all of us are suffering.
[352.96] These things you are saying 
are making me suffer.
[362.88] So, for God’s sake don’t make me suffer 
so much that I cannot tolerate it.
[367.48] You thank God that
 you are still in this home.
[380.96] Or else I would have dragged you 
out of the home a long time back.
[409.24] Don’t take brother’s name from your tongue.
[411.68] You have no relation with him.
[413.72] If you had a relation, 
then you would have cared for your relation.
[417.16] I will not let you meet him.
[422.60] Don’t you understand?
[424.40] I will not let you meet my brother.
[426.52] If you had a relation with him,
 you would have cared for it.
[430.84] But no, you are the one 
who made brother unwell.
[434.88] Because of you brother
 has reached this point today.
[438.56] Don’t take his name from your tongue.
[441.64] Let me meet uncle.
[444.00] I will not leave without meeting him.
[445.76] No.
[446.88] this is not our home, this is a hospital.
[449.00] You didn’t care for our respect at home,
[459.40] at least care for it in the hospital.
[461.80] For the sake of brother, go from here.
[482.52] Doctor, how is dad now?
[485.52] Operation was successful
[492.04] and he is under observation.
[495.20] If he gets well, 
then we will shift him to the ward.
[500.24] Can I meet him?
[501.56] No, not right now.
[503.28] Once he shifts to the ward,
 then you can meet him. Thank you.
[519.44] Where has this girl brought my brother to.
[525.96] Since this girl has come to my brother’s life,
[529.68] he has one foot in the hospital, one at home.
[536.24] I feel this girl is a bad omen.
[541.36] First her father died, then her mother.
[548.16] Now there is just relation a left in name 
and she made it reach this point.
[557.72] You know people are right,
[561.40] you should keep
 the person in the place they deserve.
[605.92] Have you come to
 the hospital or for an outing?
[609.24] I have been noticing for long,
at times you are here at times there.
[611.56] What are you doing?
[614.40] I went to offer prayers.
[617.12] What prayer is this?
[618.64] Even we pray and
 it is still not time for prayers.
[625.64] What prayers have offered?
[632.80] Where are going around 
using prayers as an excuse?
[636.72] I went to offer for uncle.
[638.64] So why are you doing us 
a favour by offering prayers.
[647.16] You should offer it.
[649.00] So, you too are insisting again and again,
that’s why I answered you.
[657.68] For God’s sake, 
don’t come in between me and my prayers.
[668.12] This is between my God and I.
[674.76] I have to answer for 
my prayers to my God, not you.
[700.56] Ill-mannered girl.
[704.40] Alizeh, where are you?
[711.24] It didn’t start, it has ended as well.
[713.28] Thank God brother is better.
[716.00] You reach the hospital immediately, 
I have been waiting for you for so long.
[722.72] Reach quickly.
[725.48] There is a limit to being careless.
[754.76] Why is he calling?
[757.32] Go ahead, Adil.
[759.92] What?
[764.28] Papa.
[765.28] What happened?
Papa.
[767.52] Papa. Papa. Adil called,
he is saying the shop is on fire.
[771.32] Whose shop?
Papa, our shop.
[774.36] What are you saying? 
Are you in your senses? Are you sleepy?
[777.96] Papa, you come,
I am waiting downstairs. Come quickly.
[779.48] Our shop…
[780.60] Go quickly. 
Yes, my shoes…
[790.44] God thank you so much.
 Can I go and meet him?
[794.12] Yes, now you can meet the patient.
[795.60] Thank you.
[798.88] Where are you going?
[800.72] I had told you not to.
[803.04] I am going to meet uncle.
[805.00] No. you cannot go there.
[807.76] I will quickly go and only see uncle once.
 I will not talk…
[810.92] No.
[812.48] Uncle has gotten better with difficulty.
[814.84] Now if you meet him, 
he will remember all the old things,
[818.28] and God forbid if he gets unwell, then?
[820.80] Do you take responsibility for his health?
[825.16] Leave from here.
[830.08] Don’t come now.
[853.76] What are you doing here?
[856.16] Did that boy who you ran with leave you 
or that boy’s family refused to accept you?
[864.16] Obviously, who will accept such girls.
[868.00] Tell me Alizeh, did you not tell everyone 
that they kidnapped me in front of you and took me?
[872.04] What is she saying?
 I don’t know what stories you are making.
[876.28] Alizeh,
[877.68] we were in the car,
 some people parked their car in front of you.
[881.64] Those people pulled me,
 dragged me, they kidnapped me in front of you.
[884.64] You were stopping them too.
[886.20] Did you not tell anyone anything? 
Why are you not telling anyone?
[889.24] Please, don’t lie.
[900.84] I am saying the right thing.
[902.76] Something has happened to you,
I don’t know why you are lying.
[930.72] In reality, because of your failed loves, 
you have become a mental patient.
[936.68] No need to do this drama in front of us.
[941.40] Fine, let’s believe for 
a minute that you got kidnapped.
[947.12] Then the kidnappers let you go just like that?
[949.36] They didn’t demand money?
[951.12] What do you think we are mad here? 
We have lost our mind?
[954.52] I was kidnapped in front of Alizeh, Afnan.
[958.32] She is lying. You believe me, 
why would I lie about all this?
[962.88] I was really kidnapped. 
Afnan, I was kidnapped in front of her eyes
[966.96] and I got away from them with difficulty.
[969.20] She is lying, believe me Afnan. 
Whatever she is saying is not true.
[973.88] Whatever I am saying Afnan is true.
[976.08] Be quiet.
[978.76] If you take my daughter’s name again,
 then I will cut your tongue.
[990.72] What was the need 
for you to do all this, Ramsha?
[994.88] That’s it, I have had enough. 
There is no place for you in this home.
[996.88] Get lost from here.
[1010.40] Everything burned to ashes.
[1014.52] Everything is ruined.
[1017.44] Everything got burned.
[1020.24] Nothing is left.
[1024.12] I am ruined.
[1027.28] Everything burned to ashes in front of me,
 and I couldn’t do anything, Salma.
[1033.92] We are ruined. We have nothing left.
 We are ruined.
[1039.84] Anwar, the police or neighbours must 
have said something that how the fire started.
[1046.48] They said there was a short circuit.
[1051.12] That start the fire and good 
worth millions was burned to ashes.
[1058.36] Everything is ruined.
[1060.60] We are on the road.
[1062.28] We have nothing with us. Nothing.
[1066.08] Be strong. Be strong.
[1069.28] And thank God, there was no loss of life.
 Why worry about goods?
[1073.92] You will work hard again and 
you will make it again. Don’t lose hope.
[1076.96] How will we make all this?
[1079.48] We are ruined.
[1081.52] Everything is gone.
[1082.68] My years of hard work.
[1084.92] My years old business got ruined.
[1095.56] I am empty handed.
[1098.12] Shani and I tried a lot to save it,
[1101.16] but…
[1102.56] but we became helpless,
 everything burned to ashes.
[1106.52] We got ruined.
[1112.64] Nothing is left.
[1114.20] We are ruined, we are on the street.
[1116.16] I don’t know how we will make ends meet.
[1123.48] Everything is ruined. Everything is burned.
[1126.08] Everything burned.
[1128.52] Papa, who knows?
[1130.24] Maybe God has some betterment in this.
[1139.64] Please, be strong. Have patience.
[1148.84] Go get a glass of water.
[1150.44] Salma, what will happen to us?
[1152.36] Have faith in God. Have faith.
[1155.20] We are ruined, everything burned to ashes.
[1159.40] I tried a lot
[1161.88] that I could put out the fire, but no,
[1164.96] I couldn’t do anything.
[1166.80] Our earning, our business, 
all got ruined in front of our eyes.
[1172.60] No one could do anything.
[1175.36] Salma, we got ruined.
[1178.88] We got ruined.
[1224.60] Brother, thank God you are better. 
All of us prayed a lot.
[1240.00] Especially Alizeh, she prayed a lot for you.
[1254.44] Uncle, you just quickly come home.
[1265.60] Yes, child, I am fine.
[1270.04] God says that when I become ill,
[1274.44] He gives me health. I am fine.
[1287.64] You people don’t worry for no reason.
[1308.28] Ramsha,
[1310.20] why are you standing there child?
[1313.08] Come here.
[1337.20] You are fine, right?
[1340.36] Uncle.
[1342.96] Forgive me, uncle.
[1354.24] What are you apologizing for, child?
[1368.88] I should apologize to you.
[1389.04] I couldn’t protect you.
[1402.04] I couldn’t save you from
 the conspiracies of my home, Ramsha.
[1424.64] You forgive me.
[1434.04] Forgive me, child.
[1495.88] Mama,
[1497.56] what was uncle saying?
[1500.12] This means he doubts us.
[1504.96] No.
[1507.04] This means brother is sure
 that Ramsha is innocent.
[1515.36] But it means the same thing.
[1518.32] No Alizeh.
[1528.00] I know this well, that,
[1530.68] brother has no evidence,
[1542.44] that we are responsible 
for what happened to Ramsha.
[1546.32] But what will happen now?
[1549.68] I don’t know what will happen.
[1559.80] But I will have to break
 the strong faith brother has in Ramsha.
[1569.20] But how?
[1575.80] Even I don’t know this Alizeh,
[1579.00] but whatever needs to be done,
 has to be done.
[1582.92] If brother’s trust becomes strong,
[1588.08] then not Ramsha, in fact we will get dragged 
out of this home and I will not let this happen.
[1636.80] Uncle, are you fine? 
Should I call the doctor?
[1639.48] Greetings.
[1642.56] Greetings. Are you fine? 
Should I call the doctor?
[1645.32] No.
[1647.60] You sit here.
[1649.12] Uncle, you don’t seem well…
Sit down Ramsha. Sit down.
[1655.12] Do one thing…
[1751.28] Afnan.
[1752.12] Yes?
Are you going somewhere?
[1754.32] To the hospital.
[1756.32] You came back from the hospital a little while back,
 now you are going back to the hospital again?
[1767.96] Afnan, since uncle has been hospitalized,
 you are not giving me time.
[1773.28] You are so indifferent.
[1778.40] There, my father is fighting
 between life and death in the hospital
[1782.12] and here you are worried about yourself.
[1784.72] Afnan, I think you are forgetting,
[1787.00] uncle is in the hospital 
because of your beloved.
[1797.40] So if you are really angry, 
then go take it out on Ramsha, not me.
[1806.68] I don’t understand, after all that happened,
 you still have her in this home.
[1819.52] In fact, what will you
 drag her out of this home,
[1821.84] you have not been able to 
take her out of your heart till day.
[1828.68] I have taken her out of my life,
[1833.28] I will drag her out of the home soon.
[1840.80] I am waiting for dad to come back.
[1843.60] I am seeing how you are taking
 her around the hospital with you.
[1848.16] I am not taking her around myself,
[1851.40] she is giving dad’s duty in the hospital herself.
[1855.52] Look, whatever she did earlier, she did.
[1858.80] But I am not that thankless
[1861.60] that she cares for my father 
so much and I forget it.
[1865.08] I saw it with my own eyes,
[1867.20] how she is caring for papa day and night.
[1869.76] She is crying for him, suffering.
[1872.48] Not like you that you give 
a duty in name and you come back.
[1876.04] You are comparing that cheap girl with me?
[1887.36] How can you even do that?
[1895.20] Are you forgetting?
 Uncle is hospital today due to her defamation.
[1907.16] But no, you have a soft corner
for her in your heart, I can see that.
[1914.32] Don’t waste your time arguing with me further,
[1917.44] I am going to the hospital.
[1951.92] Dad.
[1954.44] Yes?
[1955.92] Dad,
[1957.48] what happened dad? Are you restless?
[1959.92] My heart is a little…
[1961.80] Dad, should I call the doctor? 
He will check you after that…
[1964.52] Sit for a while, then call the doctor.
[1975.72] Look Afnan,
[1980.96] I have not put any responsibility 
on you that you cannot lift.
[1993.00] I tried to make it easy for you.
[2006.04] First,
[2007.64] I tried to mend my ways, and then
[2013.96] I tried to mend your ways too.
[2026.12] After your mother left us,
[2031.60] I fulfilled the responsibility of a father 
with complete sincerity and honesty.
[2045.84] You are absolutely right.
[2048.32] You have always cared for me with full honesty.
[2061.80] You are a really good father.
[2066.20] Live long.
[2075.60] Afnan,
[2078.80] now I feel that
[2082.84] it is time for me to meet my Master.
[2095.60] Everyone has to go on their own time.
[2112.00] I am satisfied.
[2121.84] I am just a worthless penny that 
is going to be presented to its Maker.
[2137.16] But believe me, I am satisfied that
[2140.56] my Maker loves seventy
 times more than a mother.
[2157.60] I am sure He will be kind to me. 
He will bless me.
[2164.32] Dad, what are you saying? 
Nothing will happen to you.
[2168.16] I will go call the doctor.
[2172.68] Sit for a while, buddy.
[2184.48] I am satisfied.
[2188.80] I have a burden on my heart.
[2205.56] I want that this heart gets light.
[2211.32] Dad, tell me, what do you want to say?
[2220.12] I will do whatever you tell me.
I will do what you say.
[2226.52] Afnan,
[2229.68] I hand over Ramsha to you, son.
