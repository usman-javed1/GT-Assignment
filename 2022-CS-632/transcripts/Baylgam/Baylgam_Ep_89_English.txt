What do you think? You will put allegation
after allegation on me and I will agree in front of everyone? That’s the issue with you, I come to talk to you, you scream, 
you misbehave. Why should I not scream? I will scream louder and tell everyone
that I cheated me. I cheated you, right? 
Then you do one thing, don’t live with me. But clearly tell me today, so that my mind will be clear and 
I will make arrangements for this. For God’s sake, 
you people be quiet. It is better that you make your 
daughter understand this. Mama, you still haven’t slept. You too are still awake. Yes, I was not sleepy. I know why you are not sleepy. Call Afnan, ask him 
where he is right now. If you think I am awake because 
I am worried for Afnan, then you are mistaken. It doesn’t matter to me, 
where he is. Alizay, Afnan went so upset, it is so late at night, it doesn’t matter 
to you where he is? When he doesn’t care about me at all,
then why should I care about him? I will try to sleep. I really miss dad. When dad was alive, no one would dare to misbehave 
with me so much. Whatever issue I had, dad surely had a solution for it. I didn’t know that after 
he passed away, I would face so much insult 
and humiliation. Do you know Ramsha, I was really young, 
when mama had passed away. Dad never let me miss my mother. Not just one father, in fact, he brought me up 
like a mother too. That is true, uncle knew how to live 
in relations well. I have learned from uncle 
how to live in relations. Yes, he really liked you. He really loved you a lot. I know Afnan. Aunt is calling. Pick it, Afnan. Those people will be worried for you. Let them be. I don’t want to talk to anyone. Afnan, look, they care for you. 
They are worried for you, that is why they are calling. Please pick up the call. 
Please, Afnan. hello. Afnan, me and Alizay are 
worried for you. Where are you? I am with a friend. When will you come back home? It is really late at night. Son, you are upset with the family, 
not with the home. Come home. Yes, fine. I will come. Why are you making an issue 
out of something so small? Alizay, I cannot tolerate this 
behavior of yours. I have been restless all night, 
I couldn’t sleep because of you. Hmm. You must not be able to 
sleep thinking of someone. What? I am disappointed, not with you, but with myself. In fact, I am disappointed at my love 
that till today I couldn’t prove to you, how sincere I am with you. I couldn’t make you believe 
till today that my love… Afnan, who was that girl? Afnan. When did you come? I came at night, at little late, but… I am going to the office right now. 
We will talk later. No, wait. I will have breakfast served. No, no, aunt. 
I am not hungry at all. Afnan, whatever Alizay did was wrong. I know that. I have scolded her a lot. And she is really embarrassed 
at what she did. Afnan, I know, Alizay is short tempered, but she is really good at heart. Fine aunt. I will go now. Who is that girl, Afnan? Alizay was saying that 
you have an affair with her. Is this true? No. I have no affair with her. And right now, this is the truth. Goodbye. Hello. Where are you Afnan? I am in the office. All okay? Yes, I actually had to go out. Brother took the car, and went, 
so I thought I would go with you. Oh no. I am really busy, I have back to back meetings. If you want, I can coordinate with 
the driver he will come to you. No, no, it is alright, 
I will manage. Goodbye. Hey, listen, come on, 
we have to go somewhere. No. Hey come, I will pick your bag too. 
Come quickly. Come on. Afnan. 
Come on. Come on. So she is responsible 
for it herself, Afnan. If she had gotten married to Shani, then she should have compromised 
and stayed with him. After all, Shani accepted her 
after so much happened. Or else, who marries such girls? What happened?  Why are you 
looking at me like that? You too rejected her. Yes, maybe that was the biggest 
mistake of my life. I will not tolerate you in my home 
even for a minute. Get out of here. 
Aunt, what are you doing? What happened to you?
Afnan, don’t interfere. I will not tolerate her in my home 
even for a minute. Aunt, this is not the time to talk about
these things. Please don’t do this. Please. No, Afnan, my brother left me and went 
because of her, I will not leave her. Aunt. Aunt, please. Everyone is looking, 
why are you creating a scene. Afnan, if it was in my control I would 
have handed her over to the police. Hey it is my greatness that I am not 
saying anything to her. Afnan, how will you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this home? Tell me. Take her out of this home. Aunt, come to your senses. You are not giving peace to dad’s soul 
by doing all this, you are hurting him. What do you think? You will put allegation
after allegation on me and I will agree in front of everyone? That’s the issue with you, I come to talk to you, you scream, 
you misbehave. Why should I not scream? I will scream louder and tell everyone 
that I cheated me. I cheated you, right? 
Then you do one thing, don’t live with me. But clearly tell me today, so that my mind will be clear and 
I will make arrangements for this. For God’s sake,
you two be quiet. It would be better that you make 
your daughter understand this. Call Afnan, ask him 
where he is right now. If you think I am awake because 
I am worried for Afnan, then you are mistaken. It doesn’t matter to me, 
where he is. Alizay, Afnan went so upset, it is so late at night, it doesn’t matter to you 
where he is? When he doesn’t care about me at all,
then why should I care about him? Please Afnan, think once more. Look, when you say these things, I am unable to understand you. What sort of a human are you? Even after knowing Alizay has 
hated you all her life. She tried her best to ruin you, still you are supporting her? What sort of a co-wife are you? Afnan, I am also a Muslim, 
along with being a co-wife. And a Muslim is a well wisher 
of another Muslim. Why does she not understand 
these things? I fulfill all her responsibilities. Afnan, some things take time. One day she too will 
understand all this. It will take some time. You are mistaken. What she didn’t understand 
in my love, how will she understand it 
in my hatred? Afnan, please, think once more. That’s it, I have made my decision, I cannot live Alizay now. I will not travel in two boats. You keep this and 
this is for you Bashir. Aunt, what are they all getting 
the prize for? Congratulations, Afnan. You are going to be a father. What?
Yes. Alizay? Afnan. How are you feeling now? I am much better. I gave you such a big good news and you didn’t even congratulate you. No, there is nothing like that. Actually, the good news was 
so good that I forgot in my happiness. Congratulations to you. Afnan, do you know when I used to think of a child earlier, I would feel we should wait a little 
and then plan a family. But, now when God has given me 
good news, I really like it. What is the matter, Afnan? Are you not happy? No, no, I am really happy. Really, really happy. I was just thinking that now you would really have to care 
about your health. Okay? madam, what is this for? Hey, I am going to get such a 
big happiness in my home. May God protect younger madam 
and her future child. May God give them a son. Amen. Just pray that whatever God gives them 
is safe and sound and may my daughter not get 
anyone’s evil eye. All will be well. Yes, madam, did you call me? Yes, go get two goats. One for my daughter, 
one for the future child. I want to do charity for both of them. Here you go. Yes, sure. Alizay. Alizay, child, how many times 
have I called you? Come on, food is getting cold. Mama, I don’t feel like eating food at all. In fact, I feel really heavy. Oh my love, this happens 
in this condition. It is nothing new. But this in no way means that 
you stop eating. Afnan, make her understand. Yes, aunt, I make her understand. 
But she doesn’t listen to me. You got the chance to get after me. Now if you quit eating then 
your health will be affected. Come, I will take you. 
Okay. Okay, I am coming. Come on. Did you talk to Alizay? She must have created a big scene, 
Afnan. I was even waiting for you yesterday 
that you will visit or call. When you didn’t call I had an idea 
Alizay would have created a scene. I didn’t talk to Alizay about anything. I couldn’t talk to her. Why? You had gone to talk to her, right? At times nature changes your life 
and decisions in an instant. I went to tell Alizay that 
I cannot live with her now, but… but that one moment 
changed my life. Ramsha, Alizay is pregnant. Maybe nature wants that 
I stay with Alizay. You know well, Ramsha, I really desire a child. Now I cannot leave Alizay. I cannot take her out of my life. Fine, Afnan, if you have made a decision, 
you would have made it after thinking. Go change, I will serve food. Hi Alizay. 
Hi. How are you? I am fine. You tell me. 
Did you come alone? Didn’t aunt Afsheen come? Man, mama is at home, 
I came directly from the office. Okay, come on, 
let’s go. Come. Ramsha. You know her? Yes. How are you? Ramsha, you are here? You live here? Yes. How is Adeel? Is he taking care of you? You people talk, 
I will go inform mama. Okay. Ramsha, I had to give you good news. I am expecting. The reason for telling you is that whether Adeel cares for you or not, you cannot come back to our home. After all, you are divorced and even after your divorce he is taking
so much care of you. He married you. It is also your responsibility to ensure 
that your home remains. Look, the relation between me and 
Afnan is going to get stronger, there is no place for a third person. You understand 
what I am saying, right? Hey, you people are still 
standing here? Come on. Come upstairs. 
Yes. Okay, take care. Afnan, you took long to come 
from the office today. Yes, aunt, I have a lot of work 
in the office, that is why I get late. Yes, I can understand. After brother left, you have managed
the office, home, everything well. Mama, I forgot to tell you. 
I met Ramsha today. Should I bring water?
Water… No, no, it is okay. where did you meet Ramsha? I went to meet my friend, she lives in her apartments 
with her husband.
