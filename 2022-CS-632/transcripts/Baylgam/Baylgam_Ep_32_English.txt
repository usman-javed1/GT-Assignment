Where are you going? Yeah? I have asked you to bring Ramsha 
for the wedding ceremony, he doesn’t have a lot of time, he has to go to perform another 
wedding ceremony. Okay, but let me go check on sister in law,
 I don’t know where is she. Ummm actually I forgot to tell you 
that sister in law is not well, she is resting. Really? Sister in law didn’t tell me,
 I will go check on her. oh ho, if you will go there 
who will attend the guests? You do one thing go make tea 
for the guests, I will ask Annie to come to 
the drawing room with Ramsha and I will tell sister in law, what are you thinking? The Muslim scholar has another 
wedding ceremony to attend. Go, good girl. Hurry up, 
it’s time for wedding ceremony. Okay. Is anyone here? Wait, where are you going? Yeah? Sister in law has a headache, 
I thought of giving her tea, she has been working all day, she must be tired so let me give her tea, 
she will get better. Umm actually I told you that sister in law
is not well so she is sleeping. So what? We already have to bring Ramsha 
for wedding ceremony, so I will also wake her up. What is wrong with you Salma? I am telling you sister in law is 
not well she is sleeping, you will wake her up from the light sleep 
so she can get even more unwell, and by the way sister in law 
has asked me if the Muslim scholar comes, 
we can proceed with the ceremony, she will join as soon as
 she feels better, understand? Okay. Mom, where is my jewelry? 
I cannot find it. Annie, I asked you to bring Ramsha, 
why didn’t you bring her yet? I will bring her, 
let me find the jewelry first. Forget jewelry, my child listen to what I am saying, bring Ramsha, the Muslim scholar 
is waiting he doesn’t have a lot of time, 
he has to go, go. Go, you also go with her, 
go bring her, hurry up, go, good girl, bring her quickly, 
I am standing here. Come back quickly. Coming. You go and bring Ramsha, 
I will be back. Where are you going? 
I will be back. Go. Sister in law? Sister in law? What happened? Sister-in-law?
 What happened? Who tied you here? Yeah? Anwar was saying that 
you are not well, you are resting. Salma, for God’s sake help me. Help me, for God’s sake. Look you have a daughter too 
you must realize this, help me for God’s sake, get me out of here, I will go anywhere, 
I will go anywhere. I.. i… I cannot trust Anwar anymore, after what Anwar has done to me, 
I cannot trust him at all and if Ramsha said no to the wedding, I don’t know, I don’t know what Anwar will do to me 
and my daughter. I will go anywhere 
but I cannot trust him, he didn’t even care about 
the relationship we have. How can I trust him?
 Have mercy on me, I beg you, I touch your feet 
and beg you. But sister in law where will you go
 with your young daughter? It’s not that easy. Salma, actually, my father’s friend 
lives in Hyderabad, I will go to them. But sister-in-law this is not 
as easy as you may think, you have a young daughter with you, how can you trust a stranger? When you cannot trust your own family you have to trust strangers. I… I… I will think of something. Afnan? You cut your hand wait. 
Leave it. You don’t have to show sympathy to me. Afnan? Yes Annie, but where is mom? She hasn’t come to my room for so long. Aunt is a little unwell, 
you get ready meanwhile. Okay I will get ready, 
just call mom once, I have some work from her Annie. Wear this meanwhile Ramsha, I am telling you that get ready meanwhile. okay I am going to go and change then. Ramsha? 
Mom? Ramsha?
Mom, what happened? Why are you crying? 
Are you feeling well, mom? Do one thing, just pack the things 
that you need, hurry up, I am telling you to hurry up. What happened, mom? Ramsha, there is no time for questions 
and answers, just hurry up and do what 
sister in law is saying. Sister in law, help her pack 
the important things, quickly. Mom, wedding ceremony. Come. 
Okay, fine. Quick. 
Come, come. Salma, thank you so much, how should I thank you? Sister in law? What is there 
to thank about? I am just trying to make it up for
 the sins my husband did. Sister in law, I am very embarrassed in front of you, 
whatever has happened, it was very wrong, forgive me, and never curse my children. What are you saying Salma? Why would I curse you? I have no complaints from you, 
I have no complaints from you. Okay, enough, don’t waste time, quickly leave from this gate. Aunt s absolutely right, let’s go from this way, 
everyone will see us there. Yes. The flower necklace here, a groom is incomplete without 
the flower necklace, wear it, wear it, good boy, now you look like a groom. Brother Anwar, please hurry up
 and call the bride, I have to go somewhere else too 
to perform the wedding ceremony. Yes, yes, Muslim scholar, 
I will just bring her. Okay? I will be right back. Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? Umm, where is Ramsha? Ramsha, I don’t know I was in the kitchen. 
Where is Ramsha? Neither sister in law is in her room, 
nor Ramsha is in her room, that is what I am asking you, 
where is Ramsha? I asked you to bring her. I don’t know. Annie, you were with her. I was in the bathroom. Salma, don’t hide anything from me, where did both mother and daughter go? Tell me? Where did they go? I don’t know I was in the kitchen. I will kill you. Tell me where did they go. I don’t know. Uncle, where is Afnan? My child, he left for the airport. Left for the airport? Yes, he has a meeting in 
Islamabad tomorrow. He did not tell you? He didn’t even meet you before leaving? Hey? Is everything all right, Alizey? Yes uncle, he was with me a while ago. Umm, he told me I guess it slipped 
off my mind, I was busy. Okay so what is there to worry about? Call him. Yes, I will call him. How can they leave like this? Anwar, I don’t know anything where and when did sister in law 
take Ramsha. I was making tea in the kitchen, 
I don’t know anything. Annie? You tell me? You tell me, where did they go? I told you, I, I was in the washroom. You are lying. Both of you are lying. Both of them cannot leave from here 
with you two being involved. No, no, I am not lying at all, 
I was honestly in the kitchen. Shut the hell up…
Enough, dad, enough! With they come of you scream like this
and raise your hands? How did they go? 
Why did they go? All of this is of no use now. I have suffered such a huge loss today because of this dumb woman 
and such disobedient children. Yes, don’t be so surprised, 
a useless child like you! I will not let those mother and 
daughter go away so easily. How far they can go? I will find them and bring them from 
the netherworld, the netherworld. And whatever needs to be done now, 
I will do it all alone, it doesn’t make any difference 
if you are here or not. Remember Salma, if you or your daughter turn out to be 
behind all this, I will be the worst. mom, what will we do? Stay quiet. Mom, why did we get off here? Because we have to cross 
this road and go, Salma called and said that Anwar has 
gone out to look for us. Hurry up. Mom, I am feeling so scared. 
Nothing will happen. okay come. 
Let’s go. Mom? What do you do? 
Can’t you see and drive? Sir, it’s not my fault, she was crossing the road 
like this and … You hit her and then tell me 
it’s not your fault. Yes, we are here, I am making a call, I am calling the ambulance. Greetings. Greetings. 
Mr Qasim, I am sorry to bother you at this time, 
my apologies for that. Why apology? You are saying this because you think 
that I am not an ordinary poor person? Mr inspector, what do you think that the laws are just 
for ordinary and poor people in this country? Don’t do this. Sir you are getting me wrong. It will be better if I am taking it wrong else your courtesy can ruin
 my life hereafter, my Prophet (PBUH) has said that before you those people were ruined, who used to leave the powerful 
for their weakness and would punish the weak for stealing. You tell me, you will save me in this world, 
Inspector, but the mistake that I have made, I will get punished for it on the day 
of judgement, who will save me? Sir, that wasn’t my intentions at all, if you felt that, then I am sorry for that. No, no, God forbid, I was just saying that whatever 
your legal formalities are, do that I am here at the hospital, 
my lawyer will talk to you. By the way, Mr Qasim, 
you should be praised that you bring them here, else nowadays, people let dead bodies and the injured squirm after 
hitting them in an accident, and innocent people lose their lives 
because of their minor mistake. May God have mercy. Sister, 
how are the two ladies? Sir, a patient is critical and this other patient along with her 
is out of danger now. Oh God! Have mercy, my Lord. Mom? Mom? Mom? 
Keep on lying down, don’t even try to get up, okay? Where is my mom? 
Where is my mom? The one who came here with you 
was your mother? yes. Where is my mom? Is she okay? Where is she? 
What are you doing? She is absolutely fine, you just lie down 
you cannot meet her right now. Where is my mom, 
why don’t you answer me? Is mom fine? 
What happened to her? Your mother is in the operation theater, a surgery is being performed on her, 
you keep on lying down. In operation theater? Is she fine? What happened to her? I need to see the doctor, 
I need to meet mom. Yes, yes, she is fine, 
you j ust lie down, please rest. My mom. Shani, why didn’t you sleep yet, son? Go sleep. Why are you awake? What should I do? I have nothing left except troubling myself. My child, what had to happen, it did then why are you affecting your health 
by stressing over it for no reason? Mom, I don’t understand, what place did they find? 
Where did they disappear? Bus stands, railway stations, I went to all the places I could, I didn’t find them anywhere. By the way mom let me tell you something, I think it is another issue, both of them has gone to the police station 
to file an FIR against us. No, no, sister in law will not do anything like that, why would she go to the police station
 anyway? You don’t think that for no reason. She wouldn’t know anything like that. Mom, you haven’t understood them yet, if they can leave our home 
they can do anything, I am telling you, that they have 
gone to the police. And this Ramsha, you don’t know her, this game is planned by her, 
I am telling her. No Shani, don’t think like that 
without any reason, sister in law will never do that, after all why would she do it? 
Why should she file an FIR and bring the police for us? Mom, look, look, I was telling that 
they will bring police on us, go and check, 
they have brought the police. Okay. Go and check. Go, check. What happened? What…
Shut up. Shut up, don’t ask what happened about 
everything. Open the door. Who is it? It’s me, son of brother Majeed. Okay, okay. Aunt? 
Yes? my mom is so unwell, I called the ambulance, 
my bike is not getting started too, please send Shani with me, 
we will bring the ambulance, if we don’t find the ambulance
Yeah? So then we will get the taxi. 
Okay, okay, I am calling him. You scared me. Our neighbors brother Majeed, his son is here, his mom is not well so he is here to get the motorbike 
from you, go. They just find our home. He is here to get the motorcycle. He scared me for no reason. The operation has been done but that woman is still unconscious, 
her condition is critical, it is because of me that a woman is 
fighting life and death today, I am responsible for her condition 
and pain. uncle, but this is an accident and anyone can do an accident, why are you blaming yourself? You were not even driving the car. What are you saying, Alizey? Someone’s whole life can be 
spent in pain and we can just easily get away 
calling it an accident? Whatever it is, I was present in the car,
I am responsible for this accident. Okay uncle, don’t worry, god will make things better for her. Amen, if God forbid something happens 
to the woman, I will never forgive myself. Nope. Brother, I have got the food served, 
come let’s eat. No, Afsheen, I am not hungry, I will just leave for the hospital. Brother you just came back 
from the hospital. Umm, you did as much as you could, now I think you must call their relatives
 and ask them to take care of the rest. Infact, I will suggest you ask 
the girl to call her family, they should look after the rest. Okay, I will talk to the girl 
when she gets better but I just hope God make things right. 
Okay I will leave now. Brother, at least have food. Afsheen, I don’t know if that girl must 
have eaten anything or not. I will leave for the hospital, 
I will eat something there. Brother, please have food. I am telling you I will eat something there. Mom, now don’t worry for uncle, you know that is how he is, now unless that mother and daughter 
gets well and go home, uncle won’t sit in peace, why do you worry? Okay I am hungry, let’s eat together, come, get up. Now can you tell me where is my mom? Is she okay? What is she doing? 
Is she feeling better? Doctor will tell you about this, okay? The doctor is calling me now, 
you must rest, I will be right back okay? 
Don’t go anywhere. ask the doctor about my mom. 
Okay, okay. Ramsha, do you know that I had a strange fear in my heart, I used to think that whether I will even get a chance to see
 you as a bride while I am alive or would there ever be a chance that 
you are happily married while I am still alive. Ramsha? 
Mom? Ramsha?
Mom, what happened? Why are you crying? 
Are you feeling well, mom? Do one thing, just pack the things 
that you need, hurry up, I am telling you to hurry up. What happened, mom? Ramsha, there is no time for 
questions and answers, just hurry up and do what
 sister in law is saying. Sister in law, help her pack 
the important things, quickly. Mom, wedding ceremony. 
Come. Okay, fine. 
Quick. Come, come. Look Mr Qasim, we have done her 
operation but … But what doctor? 
Is the patient okay? Look I will tell you absolutely clearly we cannot say anything right now. Patient has slipped into coma 
after the operation, when will she get conscious and when wouldn’t she, no one can say anything about it. You are the only one responsible 
for all this. Because you my mother is 
in this condition today, I am telling you if anything happens to my mom, 
I won’t leave you. Hey?
Hey what are you doing? If anything happens to my mother.. 
Leave Mr Qasim.. If anything happens to my mom,

I am telling you… take her to her room. 
I will complain in the police. I will call the entire media.
 I won’t leave you, I won’t leave you if anything happens 
to my mom. Have a seat, Mr Qasim. Brother is still awake? You are the only one responsible 
for all this. Because you my mother is 
in this condition today. Brother, you didn’t sleep yet? What happened brother? My mistakes, my sin, my blunders 
do not let me sleep. What are you saying brother? You punctually offer prayers, do all the good deeds, and you take so much care of everyone and everyone praises you a lot too so then why are you thinking this? All the praises are for God, I am a sinner, he has just covered for me. Do you know that because of me, that woman is fighting life and death. She is in coma, she is bearing the pain and trouble and I am here peacefully living in the luxuries. You didn’t see her Afsheen, doctors have been trying 
their best to save her, she has stopped eating and drinking, she is in pain because of me, just me. Brother, this was written in her fate. You are the one who says there is a reason behind 
everything God does and then brother you are taking 
so much care of her, not even one’s own family does it, you have taken all the responsibility 
from prayers till her medicines. Afsheen, you pray for her. You pray that may God give her 
good health, the daughter always have her mother on her. Brother I will pray hard for her but please don’t get your health 
affected for all this, you will fall sick like this, it is very late, please sleep now. I am not sleepy right now, I will offer Fajr prayers and 
then go to sleep. okay brother, you must sleep 
after offering prayers. Don’t worry please everything will be fine.
