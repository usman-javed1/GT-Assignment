Tea. 
Yes, keep it. Hmm, give it to me. 
Take it. Aunt, may I go to Uncle’s house? To meet him? Actually, he is not well, I just got to know he is unwell, 
so can I go meet him? You just went there last week and now you are ready to go again. Shani is not home, you may go 
with him once he is back. No, no, my child, go, you must go, 
you can go a hundred times, in fact, give my special regards 
to Mr. Qasim. Tell him that it has been so long 
we haven’t met, I haven’t seen him. He should come to the shop someday, or he can come home and 
we will have food together. Yes, yes, uncle, okay. What did you do? She just went to Brother Qasim’s house 
last week and you gave her permission again. What is wrong with you? The more she goes to Mr. Qasim’s house, it will be beneficial for us. Don’t forget that 60% of the profit 
of my shop comes from those packets that 
Mr. Qasim gets made. Do you understand? It’s good that she will go 
give our regards, Mr. Qasim will then think of us. Hey, the shopkeepers were telling that Mr Qasim has a lot of deal 
with other shopkeepers too. Just think, if we get all those deals, 
we will flourish, yeah? You just see profit in relationships too. Yes, I do and you know why? Why? Because I am not a fool like you. Have tea. And whenever she goes to 
Mr. Qasim’s house, don’t stop her. Let her go. Hello, sweetheart, hello. I don’t have as much free time as you, I am waiting for you in the lobby, 
quickly come downstairs. I know you don’t have time to waste, do one thing come to my room. What? Why would I come in your room, 
Danish Kamal? I am waiting for you in the lobby, 
you come downstairs. Are you scared of me? I am not scared of anyone but God. I know, I know that, I can’t bring everything downstairs 
to the lobby, everyone must be sitting there, come upstairs, I will sit and delete 
everything. Come. When I couldn’t get hold of you 
in my own home, then this is a public place, what harm can I do to you over here. 
Why are you scared? Come. Do you remember the room number? Come. Come in. I… Yes, else what will you do? You are such a disgusting man, do you have any shame left 
in you or not? You told me I should give you 2 million and then you will stop being 
after my life… Your eyes, your eyes are so beautiful, right? I will be back in a minute, 
you sit down. When I am not in the room, I guess you will feel safer. Sit down, I will be right back. Did Shani come or not? I don’t get this boy. Come, come, Prince Charming, where were you? You left almost half an hour before me and I am here but you couldn’t reach,
where were you? Dad, my bike broke. Oh, did your bike break or you didn’t realize 
whilst spending time with your spoiled guy friends that it had gotten so late, 
that you had to open the shop, all of them were standing outside. When will you realize your 
responsibilities? I went to Wasim on my way, my visa for Dubai is here, 
I am leaving tomorrow. What? Tomorrow? So soon? Yes, dad that soon, I am already tired of listening to you 
all the time. It’s good now you take care of 
your own business, I am going to go home and 
pack my things. That’s okay that you got your visa soon but you should have asked Wasim 
to get your tickets of a few days later? No dad, that’s not how it works. This is how it happens in all this and I am not going there alone, there are 3 to 4 more people, 
I have to look after them as well. Really? Okay, there is stock in the warehouse, 
at least get it filled. Okay, I will put it there,
you will remember the kind of son you got, you are taking full work from him 
even when he is leaving. Who is it? Sir has ordered it. Come here, come here. Keep these packets here. Okay and check the rest 
of the things there. Hello? How are you? I cannot talk right now, 
I am a little busy. Hey at least listen to me, you are busy with your work, 
you don’t even know where your beautiful wife is right now. What are you trying to say? What will I say? What I wanted to say, 
what I wanted has been accomplished. Your beautiful wife is with me right now, what else will I want? Shut the hell up. I was so sure that you will say this but if you haven’t asked me for proof, I wouldn’t be ruining my beautiful 
moments here and talking to you. I am sure you still won’t believe me that your beautiful wife is with me. Wait, let me video call you and 
then you will believe it. Wait a minute, okay, wait a minute. Hello, how are you? I wouldn’t have caused you trouble 
had you believed in what I said. Now if you want to bear the pain 
yourself then what can I do? Just give me two minutes, 
two minutes, I will make you meet your beautiful wife. I will even make you talk to her. 
Okay? Okay. Ramsha? That’s it. Look, enough is enough, I have been tolerating your drama 
for so long, take out your laptop right now and 
delete it right here right now else… Else, what? You have been continuously saying else,
else ever since you came here, else, what will you do? Danish Kamal, I am warning you 
for the one last time else I will… 
Ramsha, tell me, else what will you do? Tell me what will you do? What will you do? Mom, where is Ramsha? What happened?
 Why are you so angry? I am asking you where is Ramsha? Son, she has gone to 
Mr. Qasim’s house to meet him. What happened? 
Call Mr. Qasim. Brother, after all what is the matter?
Tell me? Where is your phone? 
Bring your phone. Go bring your phone. Bring your phone else 
I will give you a tight slap. What is it, Shani? 
Tell me what is it? Call Mr. Qasim. He is not picking up the call. umm, okay you call Ramsha. Give it to me. Ramsha is not attending the call. Mom, tell me honestly 
where is Ramsha? Son, I am telling the truth she has gone to Mr. Qasim’s house 
to meet him, she informed me before going. She lied to you that she is going 
to Mr. Qasim’s house, she is… She is with her lover right now and I have seen her myself 
on the video call. What rubbish? Are you out of your mind? 
What are you saying? That too in front of your sister, 
don’t you have any shame? Mom, let her come home today I won’t leave her alive. 
Hey? Afnan? Afnan? Actually… umm, I am so sorry guys, we will resume this meeting later, 
please, please. Okay fine. So sorry. 
Okay thank you. Hey what has happened to you?
Look at your condition. What is this? 
What is going on? Umm I killed him. I have murdered him, Afnan. Killed who? Relax and 
tell me, please? He was dying in front of my eyes.
I have killed him, he is dead, I have killed him. 
He is dead. Ramsha, Ramsha, Relax, relax,

they will tell my family. Nothing will happen, who did you murder? 
How did all this happen? Ramsha? Afnan? Afnan? 
What happened? Thank God that you are here,
