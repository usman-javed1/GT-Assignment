[26.84] Why are you sitting there?
[31.84] Come sit here with me,
[34.08] I won’t eat you.
[87.04] That script you were talking about,
[90.16] I know it but
[92.44] the location that I had to shoot at,
[96.24] another director is shooting
there already,
[97.56] as soon as his shoot ends,
[100.08] we will start our shoot, that’s why
[102.60] our schedule has been disturbed.
[105.48] Forget all this,
[108.40] tell me,
[110.56] have you ever come to
Islamabad before?
[112.04] No, umm,
[114.04] I couldn’t come to Islamabad
coincidentally,
[116.08] but I have travelled
a lot of places.
[118.68] Okay.
[119.44] Yes.
[122.80] So,
[125.20] so then let’s go,
[127.12] let me give you a tour of Islamabad.
[130.52] Definitely, but not today,
[133.64] actually I have a friend,
[134.64] she lives in Islamabad,
I have to meet her today.
[137.12] I will go with you some other day.
[140.00] We will first take a tour
of Islamabad together,
[142.32] then you can go meet your friend.
[145.72] Go.
[146.28] Umm, actually.
[146.92] Go get nicely dressed.
[149.72] Hmm.
[186.20] Mehnaz?
[190.36] Mehnaz?
[192.40] yes?
[195.56] I gave you some money
to keep it, bring it,
[200.60] I have to return it.
[202.80] Okay, I’ll just get them.
[204.64] Hurry up.
[234.60] Where did I keep it?
[244.04] Where did it go?
I kept them here only.
[257.32] Hey, Mehnaz,
[260.16] these are Rs 100,000,
[261.24] I have to give them to Adil,
keep them safe,
[263.24] okay?
[269.72] Ramsha,
[271.84] I cannot face the world because of you.
[284.96] Come already, where are you?
[298.36] Mehnaz?
[302.12] You are standing here?
[303.40] I am waiting for you there.
[305.88] Brother Sabir is waiting for
me to get the money.
[308.36] Where is the money?
Come on, give it to me.
[313.88] Why are you looking at my face?
[315.68] Give me money, where is it?
[318.48] Umm, actually, actually Sajid, umm, I…
[323.32] What do you mean by I I I?
[325.12] Where is the money?
[327.80] Sajid, actually I spent that money.
[334.24] Are you out of your mind?
[336.68] Someone made me keep
it as their possession,
[339.68] you spent it?
[342.40] Sajid, actually, Ramsha’s engagement
was being planned
[345.28] so I spent the money in shopping.
[349.08] And it is my mistake that
I forgot to tell you.
[355.80] Both of you mother and
daughter have decided
[357.68] to get me humiliated on purpose, right?
[360.80] I don’t know what sins have
I done in the past
[362.56] that I got punished by getting you as a wife
and that disobedient daughter.
[367.16] Sajid, don’t worry,
[369.04] I will get the committee
amount next month,
[371.68] I will give you the complete amount back.
[374.08] You and your money can go to hell!
[377.12] You guys have made me fed up,
[381.64] if it was in my control,
[383.44] I would have gone and committed suicide.
[386.04] Sajid? Sajid?
[393.56] What did you do Ramsha?
[396.60] You stole money from your own house.
[400.28] I didn’t raise you like that?
[404.12] Why did you do that?
[407.36] You brought so much
dishonor for your parents.
[413.84] It would have been better had
I died before seeing this day.
[425.24] Come on now, let’s take a selfie, come.
[432.04] Friendship selfie, right?
[433.80] Okay so now,
[436.12] tell me what will you eat or drink.
[438.48] Nothing sir,
[439.84] I was saying that it has gotten a bit late,
let’s go home.
[442.24] What is wrong with you?
[444.08] What happened?
[445.32] Get used to all this,
[447.68] you are about to become a star, A star!
[450.04] Hanging out, and eating
out is very normal.
[453.68] The shoot happens for the entire day,
the entire day
[456.80] and you are already tired.
[458.36] Let’s do one thing,
[459.32] let’s just have juice from here
[462.08] and we will have dinner together,
[465.08] somewhere out.
[467.88] No, no, sir, actually… I mean,
[472.00] I don’t know but I feel that
I am not feeling well so
[474.96] I was saying let’s go home.
[475.72] Wait a minute, what happened to you?
[476.80] No, no, no, sir I am just generally
not feeling well.
[479.88] I don’t have a fever.
[481.52] What happened to you?
[484.80] You are a lucky girl
[486.48] that you are sitting here at this
table with me right now,
[491.28] else people die to get
a picture with me.
[496.60] Hmm?
[498.00] Hmm.
[499.64] Juice?
[500.92] You will at least have juice, right?
[503.20] Hmm?
[511.92] Get two juices.
[514.04] And you are not well so add less ice to it.
[581.64] Hania, by the way, do you know
[583.36] he is a very disgusting man.
[586.28] He tries to touch me whenever I talk to him,
[588.16] tries to hold my hand,
[589.76] he acts so strange, is he a psycho?
[593.00] Didn’t you find any other producer
or director to send me to?
[597.96] The environment of this house is
already so suffocating
[600.60] and on top of that I have to tolerate
this problem of a man.
[602.96] It is getting very difficult for me, Hania.
[606.36] But earlier you were saying
[608.32] that I felt so nice to meet him,
[610.72] he has such a huge house,
[612.24] such a beautiful house,
[613.52] what has happened to you now?
[615.04] Your opinion changed in just two days?
[616.84] 2 days? Seriously Hania?
[619.76] It has been 2 weeks since I am here
[621.32] and he hasn’t gotten any shoot
done from me, no work at all.
[626.20] Whenever I talk to him about work,
[627.72] he starts giving me run arounds,
[629.08] he makes some excuse every time.
[633.12] Is that how work is done?
[635.68] I don’t think he plans to
give me any work.
[639.04] Ramsha, Ramsha, Ramsha,
[641.28] have some patience,
[642.84] it takes months for such work.
[646.24] And tell me something
[647.56] if Danish Kamal had no interest in you
[650.68] then why would he
call you from Karachi?
[652.76] He is not short on getting talent.
[655.92] For now, that’s what I think
[658.72] that he doesn’t have any
interest in my work.
[661.68] Oh God! You just start to
mistrust everyone so soon.
[665.64] Look, a lot of things
happen in this work,
[668.08] these handshakes and
[669.52] hugs are very common here.
[672.32] Now that you have stepped in to this field,
[673.68] learn the lifestyle involved in it.
[675.96] This is the lifestyle of this field.
[679.40] Whatever it is, Hania, I am telling you
[681.24] that I don’t want to live here.
[682.84] I don’t want to work with this person.
[685.88] Talk to Shahmir
[687.12] and tell him to send me somewhere good,
[688.84] I need to do good work, and good shoots.
[692.12] I don’t want to live here,
[693.04] I don’t want to waste my time,
[694.72] I want to work, Hania,
I want to be renowned,
[697.80] I cannot bear this anymore,
[700.92] I feel that both my time
[703.68] and talent is getting wasted here.
[706.52] My work has no value in front of him.
[709.96] Oh God! Ramsha,
[711.40] you are…
[714.00] Okay, I will talk to them
[715.92] and let you know then.
[717.32] I am waiting for you,
[719.24] let me know soon.
[720.68] Okay.
[745.12] And as long as marriage
is concerned,
[746.76] I will let you guys know myself when
I would want to get married.
[750.92] What? What did you say?
[753.88] You will talk to your dad
about your marriage yourself
[756.12] and will tell him when do you
want to get married?
[758.44] Won’t you be ashamed in saying that?
[760.36] What is there to be ashamed about?
[762.24] It is my marriage so I will tell him.
[767.60] Hey? Ramsha,
[770.56] look girls have a certain age
bracket to get married
[773.80] and if that crosses
[775.92] then it gets difficult to
find good matches.
[778.68] And if you get married on the right time,
[780.28] your parents are also at peace.
[783.08] My beloved mom,
[784.48] your mind has become like ancient times,
[787.32] I have a lot of proposals right now and
[788.64] I have a lot of age bracket too, hmm?
[790.16] I will find a good match myself.
[829.28] Sister in law?
[834.60] You haven’t slept yet? It’s so late.
[841.72] When a daughter leave home
without her parents’ permission,
[849.12] she takes with her their sleep,
[853.56] their honor, respect, grace
[857.28] and everything along with her.
[870.12] Whatever happened, sister in law,
[873.68] it is not your fault.
[878.60] It is very late at night,
[881.84] come on, try to sleep.
[887.72] Salma,
[889.72] if some stranger would have
given me this pain,
[893.32] I swear to God
[894.28] I would have called them names
[895.60] and said them bad things
to calm myself down
[898.56] but I am a mother,
[900.72] I cannot even curse her,
[904.56] I still pray to God that wherever she is,
[907.64] may God protect her,
[910.44] may she stay safe from any hardships,
[914.00] every hardship.
[936.56] Alizey,
[938.08] I and your uncle wants that you
[940.88] don’t delay your marriage any further now.
[945.88] Mom,
[947.40] why didn’t you do one thing?
[949.28] You should have come directly to the airport,
[951.24] in fact, you should have even
brought uncle there,
[953.44] you guys should have fixed
my marriage date there first
[955.72] and then we could have come home.
[957.40] How did you wait for
me to come home?
[962.80] By the way, I was expecting such
a stupid answer from you.
[969.20] Mom, just think then,
[970.64] you started as soon as I came.
[974.24] Okay now ask Farida to bring
my things to my room,
[977.56] I am going to my room
[979.20] and when will Afnan come?
[981.80] It will take him a few days to come back.
[983.68] You get freshen up
[984.84] and you can call him yourself and ask.
[986.68] Okay, fine.
[995.72] Yes, Hania,
[997.80] I think that I got cursed by my parents,
[1000.60] that is why I am not getting any work.
[1004.52] Talk to Shahmir
[1005.96] and ask him to get me good work,
[1008.24] I want to do some good work.
[1009.88] You know
[1011.52] I have just come here to make my future,
[1013.48] I want to work and earn money,
[1015.48] I want to earn so well that
[1017.76] I can face my parents in the future
[1019.20] and tell them that
[1020.56] I eloped from home to make a
good future for myself here.
[1024.48] Please talk to Shahmir
[1025.84] and get me some good work, please.
[1027.24] Ma’am? Boss is calling you.
[1031.04] Okay, fine, you may go, I am coming.
[1032.72] Okay.
[1034.12] Okay, listen? I will talk to you later but please,
[1037.84] talk to Shahmir
[1039.04] and ask him to get me good work.
[1041.08] Okay bye.
[1043.00] I pray that he is calling me for the script.
[1045.20] Let me go see it.
[1053.56] Where is sir?
[1055.08] He is downstairs at the pool,
[1056.64] come.
[1062.36] Come.
[1122.28] She is coming, sir.
[1155.68] Sir, I think you are busy,
I will come back in a while.
[1159.60] Wait, wait.
[1162.32] I am never busy for such people
[1168.04] who are interested in their work.
[1171.16] Sit down.
[1209.04] Umm,
[1209.76] sir, umm tell me about the script.
[1211.96] What are the updates on the script?
[1221.44] I have called you here to talk about it.
[1231.76] Do one thing,
[1234.52] get ready and let’s go out.
[1238.40] Out?
[1240.80] we will sit in the fresh air,
[1243.24] have a good cup of coffee
[1247.48] and then we will discuss the script.
[1256.00] And after all this,
[1259.04] we will also go shopping.
[1262.92] Why shopping?
[1266.52] Shopping.
[1269.44] We have to prepare for the shoot as well,
[1272.96] we need to get dresses
for your character.
[1279.12] What?
[1281.00] Does it mean the location for
the shoot has been finalized?
[1287.16] Shall I answer all the questions here?
[1289.96] Go get ready,
[1292.12] you will get the answers to all
your questions on the way,
[1294.80] hmm?
[1296.76] Okay sir,
[1297.68] I will quickly get ready and come.
[1299.40] Listen?
[1300.08] yes.
[1306.72] Dress up nicely,
[1311.00] that can enhance your beauty.
[1315.36] Actually,
[1317.44] this is showbiz,
[1320.68] here what is seen, is sold.
[1325.28] Yeah?
[1329.56] And then after shopping,
[1331.84] I also have to introduce
you to your male co-star
[1335.40] who will be acting opposite
to you in the serial.
[1340.60] Really?
[1341.88] Okay, sir, I will quickly
go get ready then.
[1384.96] Wow!
[1386.40] What a perfume.
[1388.72] Oh Annie,
[1390.64] I wish you were here today,
[1392.76] you would have seen
[1394.44] that I am about to work with a big
director like Danish Kamal,
[1398.60] I will be the heroin of his drama.
[1401.08] I would have told you that
[1402.12] he has gotten me so many new expensive
[1404.12] dresses for my character in the new project
[1407.68] and he has also bought me shoes, and jewelry,
[1409.32] and a lot of branded perfumes as well.
[1411.32] And this phone,
[1413.20] I would have shown you that he has also
[1415.08] bought me a new expensive phone.
[1417.76] You would have been so
surprised to see it
[1421.32] but I wish,
[1423.32] Oh Annie,
[1425.32] I wish you were here.
[1426.84] I feel like telling you all this.
[1431.32] Anyway, what can be done now?
[1434.44] It’s better that I enjoy it alone.
[1442.16] Hmmm,
[1443.92] these shoes are so nice, right?
[1463.08] Give the prescription for
the medicines to Anwar,
[1464.88] he will bring it,
[1465.56] I will leave for the shop now.
[1467.32] Okay I will.
[1468.00] Greetings, sister Mehnaz,
[1469.24] greetings brother Sajid.
[1471.08] Were you gone somewhere?
[1472.44] I was actually not well
[1473.88] so I went to see the doctor.
[1475.80] I just went to get the medicines.
[1477.28] It’s great that you went to the doctor.
[1479.28] By the way, where is Ramsha?
[1483.16] I hadn’t seen her for so many days,
[1485.40] I didn’t even see her going to the university
[1487.92] I didn’t see her at home, as well.
[1491.24] By the way, I came to your home
the day before yesterday,
[1494.04] I didn’t even see her at home.
[1495.64] Has she gone somewhere?
[1497.52] Umm Ramsha?
[1499.68] She has gone to my elder sister’s
home in Nawabshah,
[1503.48] she is not well
[1505.20] so till she gets better
she will live there with her.
[1509.92] Okay, I heard something else.
[1518.16] What did you say?
[1519.52] What do you mean?
What have you heard?
[1521.16] Hey sister,
[1522.36] you know that
[1523.40] people are habitual of talking,
[1526.48] I will suggest you call Ramsha home
as soon as possible
[1529.84] so people can shut up.
[1536.00] You cannot leave young children
at relatives’ houses nowadays.
[1539.88] Do you understand what I am saying?
[1552.72] Hello?
[1554.12] You even said that
[1555.16] you would take out time for 
me and meet me,
[1557.52] but since I have come here,
[1558.68] you have been busier than myself,
[1559.80] you aren’t giving me time at all.
[1562.00] Because you have so many 
people to entertain you.
[1566.88] What do you mean?
[1569.04] Nothing.
[1571.92] Listen,
[1573.08] no one can be what you are to me.
[1576.92] By the way, shall I say something?
[1578.84] I, now admit that you are an expert in acting.
[1583.36] You have such good dialogue delivery,
[1585.00] you give such good expressions,
[1586.60] everything seems to be absolutely true,
[1588.92] that is why I think
[1589.92] you have a very bright future in this industry.
[1593.48] What does that mean?
[1596.16] Are you complimenting me or taunting me?
[1599.08] I am unable to understand,
[1600.12] please tell me clearly what 
you are trying to say.
[1602.80] Uhhmm, I will explain it to 
you sometime later,
[1605.36] I am getting late right now,
[1606.44] I have to get somewhere.
[1607.96] I will talk to you later, bye.
[1610.44] But Afnan, listen to me, I…
[1645.28] Did you get scared?
[1648.84] No sir, I am not scared of anyone.
[1652.24] Actually, I didn’t expect that
[1653.72] you would come to my room, 
without knocking.
[1656.04] Sorry, I came because,
[1658.44] I wanted you to wear that 
dress and show me,
[1661.20] the one that I have bought for you.
[1665.00] Why?
[1666.16] I mean, are we going somewhere?
[1668.60] No.
[1670.96] I want to see you in that dress,
[1674.44] I have called the photographer,
[1675.76] he will take your pictures, stills,
[1676.92] for the serial,
[1678.36] that is why I wanted 
you to wear that dress.
[1681.60] So, quickly get ready,
[1686.44] I am waiting.
[1687.72] Okay sir, fine.
[1699.28] Come quickly, hmm?
[1706.64] Ill-mannered.
[1710.48] Thank God that the photographer is coming,
[1712.32] at least the work will start.
[1714.36] I will quickly go and get ready.
[1722.20] Wow!
[1724.32] The dress looks so pretty, right?
[1727.52] The earrings look nice too.
[1728.80] Now I hope the photographer just 
quickly clicks good pictures of me,
[1731.72] then just see
[1732.92] how I get the pictures taken today.
[1737.88] Yes? Yes?
[1740.44] Boss is calling you.
[1742.36] Okay, you may go, I am coming.
[1743.84] Ma’am, boss is calling you to his room.
[1749.20] Okay, you may go. I am coming.
[1751.84] okay madam.
[1775.80] Why is he calling me to his room?
[1780.28] The photographer might be sitting there.
[1783.52] It’s okay. Let’s see what happens.
[1810.76] Come in.
[1834.00] Come, baby, come,
[1838.32] you actually look very
 beautiful in this dress.
[1846.72] Delicate, beautiful,
[1850.32] exactly like the heroin of my drama.
[1858.40] Just wait and watch,
[1860.68] you will go very high after 
working with me in this drama,
[1867.60] very high.
[1869.64] Thank you, sir.
[1871.16] It is just your eyes
[1873.20] that made me a heroin at first sight.
[1877.88] Why are you standing? Sit down.
[1883.60] umm, sir, the photographer
 didn’t come yet?
[1887.40] Are we shooting inside the 
room or outside somewhere?
[1890.52] Some of the shoot will 
take place in this room
[1892.88] and some of it will take
 place outside in the lounge,
[1894.60] hmm.
[1895.32] Okay.
[1896.60] So the photographer is in 
the drawing room?
[1900.20] Where is he?
[1901.24] The photographer will come,
[1902.88] what is the rush?
[1905.00] What do you mean by he will come, sir?
[1906.28] He should have come by now.
[1908.28] I am sorry, I mean,
[1910.40] it has been so late,
[1911.52] why didn’t he come yet? Sir,
[1912.12] you have given all of
 them so much leverage.
[1914.64] I have spoken to him, 
he is on his way,
[1917.60] and then the shoot will start. 
You, sit down.
[1927.32] Umm, sir… Umm, I will get
 my phone in two minutes,
[1930.88] I want to show you something…
[1931.56] Hey,
[1934.04] forget about the phone,
[1937.96] we don’t need the phone,
[1940.20] actor shouldn’t have their phone
 with them when they are working,
[1942.64] or else they lose focus.
[1944.56] You should concentrate 
entirely on your work.
[1948.12] Today, you are working in my drama,
[1950.36] you are a drama heroin,
[1952.44] and you will soon become 
a film heroine as well.
[1957.48] Hmm?
[1960.12] Yes, sir, okay,
[1963.20] yes sir, you are absolutely right,
[1965.28] that’s what I am going to do.
[1966.04] I’ll do exactly like you say, same.
[1969.48] When I saw you for the very first time,
[1972.72] I had an idea at the very moment
[1975.76] that you will become 
a superstar one day.
[1978.12] Hmm.
[1979.44] That is why I even spoke to Shahmir.
[1983.88] Sit down.
[2003.48] Sir actually…
[2008.24] I will check.
[2009.12] No, wait, I will see.
[2011.04] Okay.
[2018.24] What happened?
[2019.52] Ma’am Alisha is here,
 she wants to meet you.
[2021.24] Dude! You know that
[2022.68] I don’t want to meet her, then?
[2025.08] Sir I told her
[2026.68] but she is insisting that she 
wants to meet you right now.
[2028.76] You should have told her 
that I am not at home.
[2032.12] Sir, I am sorry.
[2034.16] I am sorry.
[2035.56] Go make her sit, I am coming.
[2037.52] Okay.
[2043.92] Wait for 2 minutes, just 2 minutes,
[2045.88] I will be right back.
[2065.84] What have I gotten into?
