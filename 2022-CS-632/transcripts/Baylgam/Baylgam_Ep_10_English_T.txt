Hey, stop it. Who is it?
[24.00] Hey, stop. Have patience.
[26.40] Who is it?
[27.56] Is this Ramsha’s home?
Is this Ramsha’s home?
[29.08] Hey, yes…but….
Who are you?
[32.12] It is Ramsha’s home. 
Hey one minute,
[33.36] where are you running off to?
[37.44] Who are you people?
[38.48] Greetings madam, we have come 
to interview Ramsha
[40.84] from News Masala channel.
[42.64] Salma. Hey,
[45.20] who are these people?
[46.44] I don’t know. 
How are you related to Ramsha?

I am Ramsha’s aunt.
[53.44] Greeting madam, we have a channel named
YouTuber News Interviews on YouTube,
[56.72] and it is a really famous channel and
we want to interview Ramsha.
[60.32] Excuse me, first I will interview her.
[62.76] I spoke to her first.
[64.52] You have asked them for permission 
for the interview.
[66.72] These people have not 
given you permission.
[69.16] Yes, mister, what else?
[71.40] You don’t know how famous 
your friend has become.
[74.80] Yes, but when do you have time
 to research about me.
[78.76] You are so busy that 
you don’t even have time for.
[81.48] When will you see…
Ramsha.
[82.88] Afnan, I will talk to you later. Goodbye.
 What happened? All okay?
[85.80] Those people are here.

[88.20] YouTubers and God knows people from 
what channel have come to take your interview.
[94.28] What?
[98.24] Madam, our channel is really famous.
[100.32] You leave these people, 
and call Ramsha.
[102.60] If Ramsha gives us the first interview,
[104.60] then you will see how much 
your daughter will progress.
[106.76] We also got a lot of gifts for you
and your family.
[109.92] Look, I told you…
[111.64] Madam, try and understand.
[113.04] She said it.
[114.64] She said we don’t want 
to give an interview.
[116.88] Can you not hear me? 
We don’t need any gift.
[119.00] You leave from here. 
For God’s sake leave.
[121.60] Hey, leave.
[122.80] Hello. Hello Ramsha.
[124.20] I have a YouTube channel 
by the name of news masala.
[126.72] I want to interview you. 
You must have seen it.
[129.12] Yes. Yes. I have seen you.
[130.72] Ramsha, you must know me. 
I do a lot of programs on YouTube.
[134.28] I got a lot of gifts for you and 
your family too.
[137.24] I am sure you will give your 
first interview to me.
[139.04] Hey, yes, I know you.
[141.12] You took her interview,
[142.72] she became so famous 
after your interview.
[144.44] Take my interview, please. 
Ramsha
[146.40] Yes?
You wont give an interview,
[147.84] go to your room.
No. No.
[149.36] No, don’t you hear what your mother is saying?
 Go inside.
[152.12] We just want a little time…
Come on, go.
[154.40] You just go. 
Go.
[155.64] You come on. 
Mama, let us give an interview
[157.72] Let them take an interview, it is really good. 
I told you she doesn’t have to give an interview.
[161.60] If her father and uncle finds out, 
they will get really upset.
[164.40] The environment of our home
 is not like that.
[166.52] You do us a favour and go.
[168.28] Madam, please…
Hey, go child, go. For God’s sake go.
[171.64] Madam just once…
[172.72] Let us talk to her once. 
Excuse me please.
[174.84] Please let us talk to her once. 
Hello.
[177.40] What are you people doing here?
[180.84] Do you like in this home?
[182.56] Yes, this is my home, but 
what are you people doing here?
[185.64] I am her cousin, but what are you people 
doing here? Come on.
[189.64] We had come here to interview Ramsha.
[191.52] Can you tell us about your cousin,
 that what does she do?
[194.44] What are her routines?
[195.56] I will tell you well. Be quiet. 
Get out. Get out.
[198.84] Please you…
Get out. Get out.
[203.48] You tell us how are you related 
to Ramsha, please?
[205.24] I will tell you well. Get out.
[207.44] Get out. Switch off this camera.
[209.16] Switch it off. Get out.
[213.12] They think it is a joke.
[226.56] That is why I used to tell you people to stop her,
 don’t let her make these videos.
[232.04] But she didn’t listen to me.
[234.88] Now did you see the result of that?
[241.44] Mehnaz you did good that
[245.24] you stopped those people from 
interviewing, Ramsha.
[255.52] The passion to get yourself known 
and become famous
[259.04] in this world of social media seems 
the easiest way to the younger generation.
[277.28] This shiny path is not shining 
with any light,
[284.00] actually, it shines with a dangerous fire.
[292.24] And the youngster get deceived 
trying to find the way.
[299.36] Later they find out it is not light,
[302.04] it is a burning fire
[306.68] and a small spark rising from 
a little carelessness
[312.04] doesn’t take long to burn the person.
[315.32] You are right brother. Absolutely right.
[321.72] But when do children understand this?
[324.80] They don’t consider this fire dangerous,
[328.52] they consider it a ray of hope.
[336.12] But as parents it is our responsibility 
to save them from this fire.
[343.04] Mehnaz,
[345.36] you tell Ramsha not to get 
involved in all this.
[351.40] Hey, these channel people will give her
 importance for their rating,
[356.72] and when their need is fulfilled
[359.12] they will not give her any importance.
[368.76] They don’t care if our daughter 
gets defamed
[372.68] or her respect is ruined.
[381.28] It doesn’t matter to them at all.
[386.28] I myself am so worried.
[387.92] I am getting so many calls since morning.
[390.04] Someone says that they are talking 
from a channel,
[392.12] someone says I am a YouTuber,
[394.28] sometimes some one from the newspaper,
 the magazine,
[397.32] I don’t know where all we are getting 
calls from, I am worried.
[403.00] Sister in law you did right.
[405.56] There is no need, our Ramsha will 
not give an interview to anyone.
[411.32] And Shani, no need to say anything 
without a reason.
[418.32] Let the world speak what they want.
[424.28] Mind your own business.
[426.56] Don’t think hard.
[434.76] It is the times of social media,
[436.52] every other day someone’s video 
will go viral.
[442.92] We should be satisfied about this, papa,
[445.84] that our Ramsha has listened to us.
[448.48] No need to be strict needlessly.
[450.52] What do you understand?
[461.72] Make him understand.
[472.44] Hey, leave.
[473.60] Hello. Hello Ramsha. 
I have a YouTube channel
[476.08] by the name of news masala. 
I want to interview you.
[478.40] You must have seen it.
[479.52] Yes. Yes. I have seen you.
[481.04] Ramsha, you must know me. 
I do a lot of programs on YouTube.
[484.80] I got a lot of gifts for you and 
your family too.
[487.72] I am sure you will give your 
first interview to me.
[489.56] Hey, yes, I know you.
[491.68] You took her interview,
[493.20] she became so famous 
after your interview.
[495.00] Take my interview, please. 
Ramsha
[496.80] Yes?
You wont give an interview,
[498.40] go to your room.
No. No.
[499.80] No, don’t you hear what your mother
is saying? Go inside.
[502.56] We just want a little time…
Come on, go.
[504.56] You just go. 
Go.
[506.28] You come on.
[510.92] Ramsha.
[514.12] Ramsha.
[519.40] You are sitting here,
[520.96] I looked for you all around the home.
[523.68] It would have been so good had mama 
and aunt let me give an interview today.
[530.80] I got a really good chance, 
I could have progressed really far.
[534.00] What do you want to progress in?
[537.64] You wanted to be famous, 
that has been fulfilled.
[540.48] Now what is the issue, Ramsha.
[543.32] You know the environment of 
our home is not like that.
[551.72] Elder papa, papa were getting so angry.
[554.88] On top of that brother Shani 
was getting so angry.
[556.92] Don’t take your brother’s name 
in front of me.
[559.00] He is jealous of my success.
[564.16] He couldn’t do anything in life himself, 
that’s why.
[567.92] What is the meaning of success?
[570.16] Success is when you have done 
something great in your life,
[574.52] in which you have betterment 
in the world and hereafter too.
[582.12] Where is your betterment in this?
[583.96] No betterment in the world, 
nor in the hereafter.
[586.36] I don’t know when we will understand 
the meaning of success.
[589.76] Nowadays, this is what you call success.
[593.32] A few people recognize you.
[595.96] You have wealth, fame,
[599.04] home, car, a good job.
[602.92] This is what they call success. 
Understand?
[608.88] and respect?
[614.84] Where did respect go in your success, 
Ramsha?
[618.00] Hey, when you have all these things,
[622.88] then respect will come automatically.
[630.76] You wont have to run 
or work hard for respect.
[633.92] Respect will come after you.
[638.28] What are you saying?
[641.44] Why?
[642.60] I am right. 
Did I say something wrong?
[646.20] This is the real meaning of success it.
[651.64] You and I can deny it, 
but we cannot say no.
[654.80] So it would be better that you accept 
this reality and understand it.
[662.88] And come to the world,
[664.52] so that you find out 
what is going on in the world.
[691.40] Afnan. 
Yes?
[692.84] A person shouldn’t so selfish.
[695.08] You didn’t even ask me 
once how my day was.
[697.96] Hey, so tell me, how was your day?
[700.36] I wont tell you.
[704.68] Okay fine,
[706.48] I have kept down the ice cream, 
I have switched off the phone.
[708.96] Tell me, madam, how was your day? 
What happened?
[711.68] The day was really good. 
But you know what happened?
[714.20] A lot of YouTubers came home 
to interview me.
[717.72] Ohhh.
[718.56] But my mama didn’t give permission.
[720.24] You know, I am getting so many calls
 and messages.
[723.36] People want to meet me, 
they want to interview me,
[725.80] they want to know about me,
[728.60] but my family,
[730.84] they are not giving me permission.
[732.36] They are not giving permission. 
Yes.
[733.60] You know, if you look at it in a way,
[735.96] I feel your family did the right thing.
[738.80] Whatever decisions parents make,
[741.04] they do it for a better future 
of their children. No?
[746.44] Afnan, that is fine,
[748.04] but our parents should think that 
we too have wishes, we have a heart.
[752.08] They don’t listen to us, they are not ready
 to agree to anything we say.
[755.16] They think that they gave birth to the child, 
they brought them up,
[758.52] now they are their ownership.
[759.76] Now they will order them 
around like they want.
[761.48] This is not how it works, right?
[763.12] Absolutely.
[764.84] But I feel that when you become a parent
[767.68] maybe that’s when you will realize that
[770.56] your mother is absolutely right.
[773.52] When you go through the pain, 
then you realize it.
[776.20] Now how much pain and worries you
 and I would have given our parents.
[780.72] When we go through it, 
we will realize it.
[787.52] No?
[788.48] Okay, if I have your permission, 
can I eat my ice cream?
[791.68] It is melting.
[792.72] Yes, yes, sure. 
You have your ice cream,
[794.40] because the ice cream is 
more important than me.
[796.20] You have no interest 
in what I am saying.
[798.60] Okay fine, I wont eat.
[805.72] Afnan, your phone again.
[807.52] It is an important call, 
please one minute.
[811.28] Hello.
[812.92] Greetings.
[814.32] Greetings.
[815.96] Where are you Afnan?
[817.48] Yes, I am in the office. 
Why? All okay?
[821.76] Yes, I actually wanted to go out
[824.52] so brother took the car and went, 
so I thought I would go with you.
[828.60] Oh, I am really busy, 
I have back to back meetings.
[833.52] If you want I will coordinate with the driver,
he will come to you.
[836.80] No, no, it is alright, I will manage.
[839.36] Goodbye.
[841.00] Listen, come on we have 
to go somewhere.
[843.20] No.
[843.96] Hey, come on, I will also pick your bag. 
Quickly. Quickly.
[846.24] Afnan. 
Come on. Come on.
[884.40] Greetings mama.
[885.68] Greetings.
[887.12] I am really tired today.
[889.84] I had back to back meetings 
in the office.
[892.84] I have told you to take two to 
four days leaves from the office,
[895.60] but you don’t listen to me.
[898.44] Mama, I am not married 
that I take leaves.
[901.12] Who takes leave in engagement?
[904.44] Alizay, did you talk to Afnan
[907.92] or did he tell you something?
[910.40] No, I didn’t talk to Afnan 
about anything.
[914.48] You should call Afnan,
[916.72] you should know where he is right now.
[920.16] Why mama? Did something happen?
[926.96] nothing has happened
[928.88] but you should call and ask him 
what his routine is, where is he.
[936.44] Did someone say something?
[937.76] No one said anything to me.
[939.84] After all, he is your fiancé,
[941.40] and you should know where 
he is right now, with whom is he.
[945.20] Mama, tell me honestly,
[946.88] did someone say something? 
Is something worrying you?
[951.48] Did Afnan say something to you?
[954.20] Just like uncle,
[955.48] does Afnan too have complaints 
from me after the engagement.
[959.40] I think you have not taken out 
what brother said from your heart.
[964.76] Mama, nothing like that.
[966.44] I was just saying it.
[969.28] Afnan said nothing to me.
[972.24] I just thought of it, so I thought 
I would say it to you.
[976.84] Look, he is you fiancé now.
[978.36] You should call him two 
to three times a day.
[980.96] He will like it if you show care
[983.64] and this will also make 
your relationship stronger.
[988.04] Fine, mama.
[989.76] Okay have food served, 
I am really hungry.
[1011.00] Where are you Ramsha?
[1014.04] I even tell her not to do these things.
[1017.32] What is the time?
[1019.80] Oh God, I am really late, 
elder mama will kill us.
[1022.64] Annie. Annie. I am here. I am here.
[1025.92] Ramsha, I have been standing on the road
for so long and waiting for you,
[1028.40] you know I would have stood for long, 
I would have gone home.
[1030.28] Sorry, forgive me. 
You know what happened?
[1032.24] Afnan dropped me so far
 I walked from there and came.
[1034.80] I couldn’t find a rickshaw.
[1036.00] Ramsha, the path you are walking 
on will not have a good end.
[1039.04] Annie, what is wrong with you?
[1040.56] Afnan is sincere with me, 
and I am also sincere with him.
[1044.72] I have met him so many times,
[1046.32] he never did anything wrong with me.
[1049.12] If I have chosen him in my life,
[1051.32] then I would have done it 
after thinking.
[1053.24] You are worried for no reason.
[1055.08] Really?
[1056.56] You have lied to him about 
so many things.
[1058.28] If he finds out what will happen?
[1060.00] Will he stay sincere the same way
 as he is today.
[1062.56] You have lied so much to Afnan
[1065.64] he can also hate you in future.
[1067.92] There is no chance.
[1070.12] It is not possible that he will hate me,
[1072.96] and when the time comes 
I will tell him the truth.
[1075.20] Now don’t worry, nor worry me.
[1077.12] Why didn’t you get a rickshaw for so long?
[1079.40] I was waiting for you.
[1080.68] You should have at least stopped a rickshaw.
[1082.40] Come on, come here.
[1085.00] Hey,
[1086.48] you are Ramsha, right?
The shopping girl.
[1091.20] Yes.
[1092.32] Do you live here?
[1095.16] Yes, my home is two streets away.
[1098.84] You were being mentioned 
in the morning show today.
[1103.52] My mention?
[1105.96] In the morning show?
[1107.36] Are you speaking the truth?
[1108.92] Why would we lie?
[1110.64] You watch it, the show is repeated.
[1112.88] Oh wow, I will go and watch it 
again on the internet.
[1116.44] You come to our home. We live in the home
 with the blue gate.
[1119.40] I will introduce you to my cousin.
[1121.04] Yes, sure. Okay bye. 
Goodbye.
[1123.56] Goodbye.
[1126.00] Annie,
[1128.44] I have become so famous people have 
started to recognize me on the road
[1131.20] and I am being mentioned 
in the morning show. Wow.
[1134.40] Come on, come quickly. Mama will hit us. 
Come on. Come one. Hurry.
[1170.76] Where are you Afnan?
[1172.24] Yes, I am in the office. 
Why? All okay?
[1176.56] Yes, I actually wanted to go out
[1179.36] so brother took the car and went, 
so I thought I would go with you.
[1183.76] Oh, I am really busy, 
I have back to back meetings.
[1188.36] If you want I will coordinate with the driver,
he will come to you.
[1218.48] Mama, I cannot do this work.
[1220.64] I cannot do it, but…
[1225.16] Who is it, man?
[1227.76] Who is this?
[1229.68] Hello.
[1233.48] Yes.
[1235.24] Yes, yes, this is Ramsha Sajid. 
Who are you?
[1248.68] What?
[1264.16] Salma, both those suits were really good
[1266.20] and you got them so cheap.
[1267.92] Mama. Mama. Ouch.
[1270.60] Ramsha have gone mad? 
Watch where you are going.
[1272.56] Move out of the way. 
Move out of the way.
[1274.40] What happened? 
You know who called me right now?
[1276.96] Sister Shiza.
[1279.24] Who Shiza? We have no Shiza
 in our family.
[1281.40] Hey mama, I am not talking 
about our family.
[1283.80] The one whose morning show 
you watch daily,
[1286.32] I got a call from her.
[1287.68] She is inviting me to her show 
as a guest.
[1290.72] What? Shiza?
[1293.08] You know these two watch that 
show with a lot of interest.
[1296.92] Ramsha, I cannot believe 
she invited you to the show.
[1299.80] I am speaking the truth.
[1301.12] Her assistant called and she invited me 
to her show tomorrow.
[1304.60] I told her I will ask my mother and tell her.
[1306.76] I have ten to fifteen minutes, mama. 
I have to call and tell her just now.
[1309.08] Yes, sister in law. Yes.
[1327.60] Hey mama, listen to me once. 
Stop it.
[1329.48] Mama.
[1331.04] What is wrong?
[1332.44] What is the problem with going 
in the morning show?
[1334.16] You watch the morning show 
with a lot of interest.
[1336.56] And after all, has anyone in our family
 been seen on TV till now?
[1340.56] No, right? I will be seen.
[1342.56] You should be happy. Really happy.
[1345.60] But see, you are getting so worried,
 without a reason.
[1348.16] Now you quickly say yes,
because she has called twice.
[1350.96] I have to answer her.
[1353.08] Let your papa come, 
I will talk to him.
[1355.40] If he says that you can go, 
then you can go.
[1358.44] Mama, you say yes, at least. 
I will convince papa like this.
[1363.48] Anyway, your papa must be on the way.
[1365.76] Talk to him.
[1367.32] If he allows, go. I am telling you.
[1370.84] Hey mama, why don’t you understand?
[1374.16] It is such a big channel and 
such a morning show too.
[1377.12] This is nothing ordinary.
[1378.64] And mama, you know my friends long 
to sit in the audience of this morning show.
[1383.52] And me? I have been invited 
for an interview.
[1387.28] This is a big deal.
[1389.04] Mama, let’s go it will be fun.
[1391.24] You know, she has said bring 
your mother along.
[1393.52] So what is the problem in it?
[1394.96] Mama, till today no one from our family
has come on TV.
[1398.00] I will come on TV.
[1399.88] Along with me, you too will come.
[1401.76] If you say that I will put a status
 on whatsapp
[1403.84] that don’t forget to watch me and my mama 
in the morning at 9 am in the morning show.
[1408.44] What say?
[1410.60] Yes, but till your papa doesn’t say yes,
[1414.32] you cannot go.
[1416.72] Mama, you don’t understand me.
[1418.96] Look, when I tell papa that I am going 
to the morning show tomorrow.
[1421.96] I know he will be really happy.
[1424.32] And they are calling me 
again and again.
[1427.12] I have to pick out clothes, 
I have to pick our jewellery.
[1428.68] Mama.
[1429.76] Mama, please say yes. Please,
[1431.68] if you say yes, 
then I will convince papa.
[1434.12] Papa, please let me go.
[1436.20] I am getting such a big opportunity.
[1438.08] Not everyone gets such chances.
[1441.16] And I am not going alone, they have also
invited mama along with me.
[1444.56] They said I will get a really good protocol
[1446.96] and they will also drop us back home.
[1449.28] Please let me go.
[1451.08] When I said no, 
then why are you insisting?
[1456.24] Papa…
Let her go.
[1459.00] After all, it is a family show.
[1460.96] I will go with her,
[1463.16] I will bring her back. 
The child is insisting.
[1466.16] She is a child, 
that is why she is insisting.
[1468.08] You are grown up, 
at least you understand.
[1470.24] Hey, these channel people are like that.
[1473.04] They care about their rating.
[1474.96] They want rating at all cost. 
That’s what they do.
[1477.72] I don’t know how they present things 
with exaggeration.
[1480.68] They would ask the child one thing, 
and she would say something else.
[1483.72] She doesn’t know about these things.
[1486.68] Hey, why don’t I know papa?
[1488.32] I am not stupid that I will say anything.
[1490.96] I will answer correctly.
[1493.28] Try and understand me. 
I promise you
[1495.80] the show will be really good, 
everything will be really good.
[1498.56] Please, let me go.
[1499.84] I am making wish for the last time. 
After this, I will not make a wish or desire.
[1503.48] Please, let me go. 
You say the same thing on every wish.
[1505.64] I promise, this is the last, 
I will not make a wish after this.
[1508.52] Please let me go.
[1510.44] Okay, agree. Please.
[1514.44] Please.
[1515.44] Last time. After this, 
she won’t make a wish.
[1519.08] Please, last time. I promise, 
for the last time.
[1521.56] Please agree, please, 
please, please.
[1527.16] Fine.
[1528.88] Papa.
[1531.04] Thank you so much. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you.
[1542.80] If I say no once,
[1544.72] don’t make me say yes.
[1554.68] Afnan, son, did you keep everything?
[1556.72] Yes, dad I have packed all your clothes,
[1559.76] I have also kept your night suits.
[1561.20] Okay see, your mobile charger 
and powerbank is in this pocket.
[1566.00] It is good. Fine.
[1567.28] Dad, you will be back 
by Monday, right?
[1569.60] We have a really important meeting 
with Mr. Munir,
[1571.64] it is necessary for you to be there.
[1572.80] It is just a religious gathering
 for three days,
[1574.88] we will have a congregational prayer 
on Sunday, then I will come.
[1579.28] Brother,
[1581.00] Alizay made shami kebabs for you.
[1583.16] Uncle.
[1584.24] Hey child, why did you bother? 
What was the need?
[1586.56] You also get food there.
[1588.48] Brother, you won’t get the taste 
like home.
[1593.36] Hey, controlling your wishes, 
controlling your desires,
[1597.24] connecting with God is the objective 
of religious gathering.
[1604.44] If going there, 
the heart is attached here,
[1607.88] and the heart runs after desires,
 then what is the point.
[1610.76] Uncle, I made him with a lot of effort.
[1613.16] Hey child, I won’t break your heart.
[1615.32] I will take it and share it 
with friends there.
[1619.24] Dad, I will take out the car. 
Yes, fine.
[1621.56] Okay, you drop me to the mosque, 
we will go from there.
[1624.40] Fine dad. Absolutely fine.
[1626.76] Pray for us.
[1628.44] yes, uncle pray for me the most.
[1631.08] I pray for all of you.
[1632.92] Live long, may God protect you.
[1635.44] Okay, bye.
[1636.84] Goodbye. 
Bye.
[1647.24] Here you go,
[1648.48] these are all the dresses, I have.
[1650.16] Select one from it and please wear it
 on the show in the morning.
[1654.00] I don’t like a single dress from them.
[1656.64] I don’t understand what I should wear, 
all the dresses are useless.
[1660.96] What do I do?
[1663.08] We will do one thing.
[1664.12] Last week, a Tik Toker, wore a maxi 
in sister Shiza’s show.
[1667.20] She looked good.
[1668.68] You too try wearing a maxi, 
you will look really pretty.
[1671.40] No, man, Annie.
[1673.04] The fashion of maxi is old
[1675.56] I want that I wear the good dress 
of today’s fashion.
[1679.72] Elder papa shouldn’t have given you
 permission.
[1681.88] Have you gone mad?
What nonsense is this?
[1685.08] I got permission with so much difficulty,
[1686.44] you say stupid things and 
give it the evil eye.
[1691.44] I don’t understand what…
[1694.24] Annie.
[1696.00] Savera’s sister got married ten days back,
 right?
[1698.48] She has so many dresses,
[1700.36] why don’t we go to her and take them?
[1702.48] Will you wear Shararas and ghararas
 to the morning show?
[1705.80] Hey, I am not wearing shararas 
and ghararas,
[1707.60] apart from that she has a lot of 
other frocks and clothes.
[1710.88] Lets do one thing, let’s go to her 
and get two to three colour frocks.
[1714.56] No.
[1715.76] Annie, please,
[1717.12] are you not my beloved sister?
[1719.12] Annie, are you not my friend?
[1722.04] Please, please, please, 
we will go for ten minutes
[1723.92] and come back quickly. 
Annie, please.
[1725.48] Mama won’t give permission.
[1727.16] Please, please, please,
 my beloved sister,
[1729.32] come with me, 
I don’t want to go alone,
[1731.28] we will quickly go get the dress 
and come.
[1732.96] You bother me a lot, Ramsha.
[1734.68] Go. Quickly go get ready, 
and come with me.
[1737.08] While I will wear my scarf and come.
 Go. Go. Go.
[1759.28] This girl is completely mad.
[1764.12] Okay.
[1768.56] Thank you very much.
[1782.60] Afnan, are you busy?
[1784.16] No, no, aunt,
[1787.08] I am not busy at all. 
What happened?
[1790.04] I feel you have made a lot of new friends.
[1793.96] I am noticing you are really busy 
in your phone nowadays.
[1799.56] Really?
[1801.28] No aunt, I don’t feel this way.
[1803.44] Just for work, and when will I 
make new friends.
[1807.36] You know, I don’t have time.
[1809.84] I spend all my time in the office.
[1813.88] I just have a few old friends, 
who message me at times,
[1817.48] so I talk to them.
[1819.00] How will I make new friends?
[1820.48] Yes, after all, you and Alizay will get married.
[1824.44] When you get married,
[1826.52] then when will you get time for friends.
[1828.64] After marriage, a person belongs
to the family, right?
[1833.92] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[1838.08] You are really smart, Afnan,
[1840.80] and I expect you to be this smart.
[1847.72] Aunt.
[1851.12] Why are you saying this?
 I will never disappoint you.
[1855.04] Good.
[1858.68] Come on, I will go. 
You enjoy your tea.
[1886.96] Do you see?
[1888.48] The office so huge and beautiful.
[1891.16] Yes,
[1892.64] you know these channel people 
have such big offices.
[1898.16] Hey, aunt Khalida’s daughter 
also works in a channel office.
[1904.20] She was telling me
[1905.72] that the office is so big and 
the entire office has an AC.
[1909.96] And these people really care 
for their employees.
[1913.60] Hey if they have to travel 
within the country,
[1917.76] they send them by plane.
[1919.72] They spend millions.
[1921.80] They really care for their employees.
[1925.68] You are right.
[1927.52] That’s true, they really care.
[1931.12] Hey Ramsha,
[1933.00] we have been here for long, 
why are they not calling us?
[1936.76] Mama, lower your voice,
[1939.00] it is just 7 am,
[1942.00] and the morning show starts at 9 am.
[1943.76] There are a lot of issues inside. 
Have patience, wait a little.
[1947.96] Still they should call us.
Now it is really late.
[1950.80] Mama, they have to set things,
[1953.52] they have to put up things, there are lights,
there are cameras, wait.
[1958.20] Hello Ramsha.
[1960.04] Hi. Mama, come on.
[1962.12] How are you?
I am good. This is my mother.
[1964.92] Greetings madam. 
Greetings.
[1967.04] My name is Komal,
[1968.52] you spoke to me with regards to the show.
[1970.16] Yes. Yes.
[1971.16] Did you people face any worry 
or difficulty coming here?
[1973.72] No, no, nothing happened.
[1975.60] No, child ,we came in a taxi
[1978.40] and the taxi dropped us here directly.
[1981.48] Okay, that’s good.
[1983.40] Ramsha, you come with me, 
we will do your hair and makeup.
[1986.04] Then we will take you to the set.
[1988.12] Fine. 
Hey,
[1989.32] but she has put on makeup, 
what else do you want to do?
[1993.64] Aunty, you are right,
[1995.72] but when we come in front of the camera,
it has some requirements.
[1998.92] In fact, you will also have to get your hair 
and makeup done.
[2001.48] And we are giving you 
two the wardrobe.
[2003.60] You two do one thing, 
come with me.
[2005.48] Me…
[2006.60] Yes. Yes. Mama, yes. 
Come on. Come on.
[2017.96] Our makeup will start soon. 
Yes.
[2021.32] Ramsha, this is our makeup artist, Nomi.
[2024.12] Hello Ramsha. 
Hi. How are you?
[2026.28] I am good. How are you?
I am good.
[2028.28] Nomi, you know you only have 
fifteen minutes to prepare Ramsha.
[2033.72] Don’t worry, I will prepare her 
in ten minutes.
[2035.92] Ramsha, come with me. 
Come on. Come on.
[2037.60] Hey, hey, what is wrong?
[2040.20] And what is this shamelessness?
[2042.16] A man will do my daughter’s makeup?
 No. No. No.
[2045.44] Aunty, this is our makeup artist, Nomi.
[2048.00] Hey, he may be your makeup artist,
[2050.40] but no man will do 
my daughter’s make up.
[2052.44] that’s it, I have told you.
You people should be ashamed.
[2054.76] Aunty, please calm down.
[2056.84] Maybe you saw all this for the first time.
[2059.16] That is why you are so hyper.
[2060.68] Ramsha, you make your mother understand,
[2063.04] all this is really normal nowadays.
[2066.08] Yes, mama, it is normal. It is normal.
[2069.52] Be quiet, normal!
[2071.64] That’s it, I have had enough.
[2073.24] What justice is this that whatever 
they say we will agree to it.
[2076.72] Whether it is good or bad.
[2078.44] No makeup artist will do 
your make up and
[2080.44] nor will you sit here and 
give an interview.
[2082.40] This doesn’t happen, come on. 
Aunty. Aunty. Aunt. Relax. Relax.
[2086.76] If you don’t want that 
Nomi does Ramsha’s makeup
[2089.40] then it will not happen. 
Nomi, you leave.
[2094.96] I have another makeup artist Ruby,
[2096.80] she will do Ramsha’s makeup, 
you don’t worry.
[2099.36] Yes, best. Fine. 
This is fine, mama.
[2102.88] Ruby will do my makeup, 
you sit comfortably.
[2104.72] Aunty, you sit,
[2106.28] I will take you for makeup after Ramsha.
[2109.24] Come on. 
Ramsha, you come on.
[2110.28] Come on. Come on.
[2143.60] it is really late.
[2147.12] She should have come by now.
[2157.88] I will go and check.
[2164.80] Listen, my daughter Ramsha was taken 
for makeup to style her hair.
[2172.28] It has been long, 
she has not come back.
[2175.04] Where is your makeup room?
[2177.84] You go straight and take a left,
the makeup room is there.
[2182.20] Okay, thank you.
[2187.80] Standby Shiza, we are going on air.
[2189.96] Three. Two. One. Cue.
