Where are you going? Mama, I was just going to the office. Huh? Don’t you know today is brother’s operation and you are going to the office?
 Are you feeling okay? Yes, mama, I spoke to Afnan actually, 
he said the operation is in the evening. So I thought I would come directly to the office. Alizeh, when you come to the hospital
 to meet brother, it is just for a little while... ...and today is his operation and 
you want to go to the office. Mama, I cannot take more days off. It is necessary to work as well. That’s why I am saying to you that 
I will reach timely, before the operation. Is this not enough. No, this is not enough. Since brother has been admitted to the hospital, Ramsha has made it her second home. She cares for him day and night. She is useless. Whether she makes it her second home or do anything,
 what difference does it make? It makes a difference. But not to Ramsha, to Afnan. If Afnan is quiet it in no way means
 he doesn’t see anything. Alizeh, have you forgotten, how much effort we have put in 
to degrade Ramsha in Afnan’s eyes. You want all of that to go to waste. Mama, I am getting calls from the office. 
Look, I will surely try to come early in the evening. Alizeh. Alizeh. Madam Ramsha, 
Mr. Qasim has his operation today. Yes, that’s why the doctors have said that 
they will stop giving food to uncle in the afternoon. That is why I am quickly making soup, 
so that uncle has at least a little soup. Madam Ramsha, you should have told me.
 I would have made the soup. You know this. Uncle really likes the soup I make. That’s why I came. Listen, the doctors have said that uncle is not well, pray for him. Yes, I surely will. Mr. Qasim cares for everyone. May God give him a long and healthy life. Amen. Amen. Madam Ramsha, you rest a little. I will rest when uncle will be fine. Wow. Wow. Wow. First you made my brother get near to his death and now you want to care for him and 
tell the entire world that you care more for him than us. There is nothing like that. I don’t want to tell anyone anything,
nor do I want to prove it. Whatever I am doing is with my heart. My God knows my intentions. I feel you did all this
 to take revenge from Afnan. Because you couldn’t make your own home, so you thought why should 
I let Alizeh and Afnan make a home. That’s why you gave sorrow, 
pain and suffering to brother. Because of him, all of us are suffering. These things you are saying 
are making me suffer. So, for God’s sake don’t make me suffer 
so much that I cannot tolerate it. You thank God that
 you are still in this home. Or else I would have dragged you 
out of the home a long time back. Don’t take brother’s name from your tongue. You have no relation with him. If you had a relation, 
then you would have cared for your relation. I will not let you meet him. Don’t you understand? I will not let you meet my brother. If you had a relation with him,
 you would have cared for it. But no, you are the one 
who made brother unwell. Because of you brother
 has reached this point today. Don’t take his name from your tongue. Let me meet uncle. I will not leave without meeting him. No. this is not our home, this is a hospital. You didn’t care for our respect at home, at least care for it in the hospital. For the sake of brother, go from here. Doctor, how is dad now? Operation was successful and he is under observation. If he gets well, 
then we will shift him to the ward. Can I meet him? No, not right now. Once he shifts to the ward,
 then you can meet him. Thank you. Where has this girl brought my brother to. Since this girl has come to my brother’s life, he has one foot in the hospital, one at home. I feel this girl is a bad omen. First her father died, then her mother. Now there is just relation a left in name 
and she made it reach this point. You know people are right, you should keep
 the person in the place they deserve. Have you come to
 the hospital or for an outing? I have been noticing for long,
at times you are here at times there. What are you doing? I went to offer prayers. What prayer is this? Even we pray and
 it is still not time for prayers. What prayers have offered? Where are going around 
using prayers as an excuse? I went to offer for uncle. So why are you doing us 
a favour by offering prayers. You should offer it. So, you too are insisting again and again,
that’s why I answered you. For God’s sake, 
don’t come in between me and my prayers. This is between my God and I. I have to answer for 
my prayers to my God, not you. Ill-mannered girl. Alizeh, where are you? It didn’t start, it has ended as well. Thank God brother is better. You reach the hospital immediately, 
I have been waiting for you for so long. Reach quickly. There is a limit to being careless. Why is he calling? Go ahead, Adil. What? Papa. What happened?
Papa. Papa. Papa. Adil called,
he is saying the shop is on fire. Whose shop?
Papa, our shop. What are you saying? 
Are you in your senses? Are you sleepy? Papa, you come,
I am waiting downstairs. Come quickly. Our shop… Go quickly. 
Yes, my shoes… God thank you so much.
 Can I go and meet him? Yes, now you can meet the patient. Thank you. Where are you going? I had told you not to. I am going to meet uncle. No. you cannot go there. I will quickly go and only see uncle once.
 I will not talk… No. Uncle has gotten better with difficulty. Now if you meet him, 
he will remember all the old things, and God forbid if he gets unwell, then? Do you take responsibility for his health? Leave from here. Don’t come now. What are you doing here? Did that boy who you ran with leave you 
or that boy’s family refused to accept you? Obviously, who will accept such girls. Tell me Alizeh, did you not tell everyone 
that they kidnapped me in front of you and took me? What is she saying?
 I don’t know what stories you are making. Alizeh, we were in the car,
 some people parked their car in front of you. Those people pulled me,
 dragged me, they kidnapped me in front of you. You were stopping them too. Did you not tell anyone anything? 
Why are you not telling anyone? Please, don’t lie. I am saying the right thing. Something has happened to you,
I don’t know why you are lying. In reality, because of your failed loves, 
you have become a mental patient. No need to do this drama in front of us. Fine, let’s believe for 
a minute that you got kidnapped. Then the kidnappers let you go just like that? They didn’t demand money? What do you think we are mad here? 
We have lost our mind? I was kidnapped in front of Alizeh, Afnan. She is lying. You believe me, 
why would I lie about all this? I was really kidnapped. 
Afnan, I was kidnapped in front of her eyes and I got away from them with difficulty. She is lying, believe me Afnan. 
Whatever she is saying is not true. Whatever I am saying Afnan is true. Be quiet. If you take my daughter’s name again,
 then I will cut your tongue. What was the need 
for you to do all this, Ramsha? That’s it, I have had enough. 
There is no place for you in this home. Get lost from here. Everything burned to ashes. Everything is ruined. Everything got burned. Nothing is left. I am ruined. Everything burned to ashes in front of me,
 and I couldn’t do anything, Salma. We are ruined. We have nothing left.
 We are ruined. Anwar, the police or neighbours must 
have said something that how the fire started. They said there was a short circuit. That start the fire and good 
worth millions was burned to ashes. Everything is ruined. We are on the road. We have nothing with us. Nothing. Be strong. Be strong. And thank God, there was no loss of life.
 Why worry about goods? You will work hard again and 
you will make it again. Don’t lose hope. How will we make all this? We are ruined. Everything is gone. My years of hard work. My years old business got ruined. I am empty handed. Shani and I tried a lot to save it, but… but we became helpless,
 everything burned to ashes. We got ruined. Nothing is left. We are ruined, we are on the street. I don’t know how we will make ends meet. Everything is ruined. Everything is burned. Everything burned. Papa, who knows? Maybe God has some betterment in this. Please, be strong. Have patience. Go get a glass of water. Salma, what will happen to us? Have faith in God. Have faith. We are ruined, everything burned to ashes. I tried a lot that I could put out the fire, but no, I couldn’t do anything. Our earning, our business, 
all got ruined in front of our eyes. No one could do anything. Salma, we got ruined. We got ruined. Brother, thank God you are better. 
All of us prayed a lot. Especially Alizeh, she prayed a lot for you. Uncle, you just quickly come home. Yes, child, I am fine. God says that when I become ill, He gives me health. I am fine. You people don’t worry for no reason. Ramsha, why are you standing there child? Come here. You are fine, right? Uncle. Forgive me, uncle. What are you apologizing for, child? I should apologize to you. I couldn’t protect you. I couldn’t save you from
 the conspiracies of my home, Ramsha. You forgive me. Forgive me, child. Mama, what was uncle saying? This means he doubts us. No. This means brother is sure
 that Ramsha is innocent. But it means the same thing. No Alizeh. I know this well, that, brother has no evidence, that we are responsible 
for what happened to Ramsha. But what will happen now? I don’t know what will happen. But I will have to break
 the strong faith brother has in Ramsha. But how? Even I don’t know this Alizeh, but whatever needs to be done,
 has to be done. If brother’s trust becomes strong, then not Ramsha, in fact we will get dragged 
out of this home and I will not let this happen. Uncle, are you fine? 
Should I call the doctor? Greetings. Greetings. Are you fine? 
Should I call the doctor? No. You sit here. Uncle, you don’t seem well…
Sit down Ramsha. Sit down. Do one thing… Afnan. Yes?
Are you going somewhere? To the hospital. You came back from the hospital a little while back,
 now you are going back to the hospital again? Afnan, since uncle has been hospitalized,
 you are not giving me time. You are so indifferent. There, my father is fighting
 between life and death in the hospital and here you are worried about yourself. Afnan, I think you are forgetting, uncle is in the hospital 
because of your beloved. So if you are really angry, 
then go take it out on Ramsha, not me. I don’t understand, after all that happened,
 you still have her in this home. In fact, what will you
 drag her out of this home, you have not been able to 
take her out of your heart till day. I have taken her out of my life, I will drag her out of the home soon. I am waiting for dad to come back. I am seeing how you are taking
 her around the hospital with you. I am not taking her around myself, she is giving dad’s duty in the hospital herself. Look, whatever she did earlier, she did. But I am not that thankless that she cares for my father 
so much and I forget it. I saw it with my own eyes, how she is caring for papa day and night. She is crying for him, suffering. Not like you that you give 
a duty in name and you come back. You are comparing that cheap girl with me? How can you even do that? Are you forgetting?
 Uncle is hospital today due to her defamation. But no, you have a soft corner
for her in your heart, I can see that. Don’t waste your time arguing with me further, I am going to the hospital. Dad. Yes? Dad, what happened dad? Are you restless? My heart is a little… Dad, should I call the doctor? 
He will check you after that… Sit for a while, then call the doctor. Look Afnan, I have not put any responsibility 
on you that you cannot lift. I tried to make it easy for you. First, I tried to mend my ways, and then I tried to mend your ways too. After your mother left us, I fulfilled the responsibility of a father 
with complete sincerity and honesty. You are absolutely right. You have always cared for me with full honesty. You are a really good father. Live long. Afnan, now I feel that it is time for me to meet my Master. Everyone has to go on their own time. I am satisfied. I am just a worthless penny that 
is going to be presented to its Maker. But believe me, I am satisfied that my Maker loves seventy
 times more than a mother. I am sure He will be kind to me. 
He will bless me. Dad, what are you saying? 
Nothing will happen to you. I will go call the doctor. Sit for a while, buddy. I am satisfied. I have a burden on my heart. I want that this heart gets light. Dad, tell me, what do you want to say? I will do whatever you tell me.
I will do what you say. Afnan, I hand over Ramsha to you, son.
