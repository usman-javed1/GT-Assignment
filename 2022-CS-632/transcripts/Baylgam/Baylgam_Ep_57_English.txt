Okay Ramsha, now forgive me, I mean, I have been apologizing continuously and you are showing attitude, 
what is this behavior? So when did I ask you to apologize? So that’s even better, you have got a husband who is accepting 
his mistake without you having to ask for it, you should be happy. Yes, I have actually got a 
very nice husband, a kind of husband that 
I never even wished for. Okay enough now, forgive me. You know my anger is dangerous, I fail to understand what is right 
and wrong. You shouldn’t do that, I have asked you multiple times 
not to make me angry. Okay forget everything, 
come with me. Where? I am getting a new bike, and that too of your choice, 
whichever you like. So come with me. Why are you looking 
at me like this? I have arranged money too, now there is no problem, 
you just come along, I just want it to be of your choice. So, let’s go. Ramsha, I love you a lot, I don’t understand how to express it
and do you know when I thought of buying a new bike, I just knew it will be of your choice, 
the one you like. Now forgive me and come with me, we will buy a new bike. You get ready I ma waiting 
for you downstairs. Afnan, did Shani come to your office? Is everything okay? Umm, Dad, see what has happened to my memory,
I forgot to tell you. When I reached office, what did I see? 
Shani was standing in front of me, a guy works there, he turned out 
to be his friend. Now it doesn’t seem nice 
that I avoid him so, I invited him to my office, offered him tea, he sat for a while, had tea and left. That’s great, and why would you 
avoid him? It wouldn’t be nice if he had left 
without meeting you. If you give respect to the son-in-law, 
the daughter gets respect at her in-laws. Brother, you have made Shani 
your son-in-law, though you don’t have a daughter 
and you are pampering your son-in-law. Afsheen, you talk such strangely
 sometimes, everyone’s daughter is a daughter. If someone hasn’t been blessed 
with a daughter, for him the daughters of everyone 
are of equal respect, lovable. People who get to pamper and 
spoil daughters are very fortunate. Now look, I don’t have a daughter but how God has 
given me a chance to pamper a daughter, what else would I want, yeah? Yes, you are right. Now look, despite being an uncle, I pampered and spoiled my 
daughter Alizeh like a father. By the way, I agree to the fact that you give a lot of love and 
respect to all the daughters. Thank God. I don’t see Alizeh around? She didn’t even come to eat, 
is everything all right? Yes, she wasn’t quite well 
so she slept. May God make her well. Oh wow, you have done wonders. It means you are two steps ahead 
from your father. This is called that the snake dies 
without breaking the stick. See how wonderful your son is. By the way, sometimes I feel I am more intelligent than you. I mean to say that after all 
whose son am I? By the way I am very surprised 
about a fact that Afnan gave you money 
instead of Mr. Qasim and that too without asking for it, it means that just like Mr. Qasim, Afnan is also 
very concerned about our Ramsha. Yes Dad, and that’s what has been 
bothering me a lot as well. Whatever importance Ramsha has 
in Mr. Qasim’s house is only because of Mr. Qasim, moreover, what’s surprising is that 
in Mr. Qasim’s house, even his servants give 
the same respect to Ramsha like she is the owner of that house. What are you thinking? Nothing, I will take Ramsha along and 
show the new bike there. She will get happy as well and 
Mr. Qasim will even see that his money is being spent right. Hey, why not? Why not? 
You must definitely go so he even gets to know that just by his little favors, Ramsha gets so much happiness 
in her life so he does these favors often. Yes dad, I will even show them and 
brag about it. But the shop… Don’t worry about the shop 
when I am here, I will take care of it. Go, my son, Go. Then Shani just said that 
I have bought a new bike so let’s go and show it to uncle first. It’s great that you came, 
I was just missing you. I was missing you a lot too, Uncle. Greetings. Greetings, may peace be upon you. 
Greetings. Hey, how are you here such 
early morning? Actually, Shani bought a new bike so he said let’s go and show it 
to uncle first. I was just telling Uncle that he wanted
to come last night but then I told him that it’s night, 
we will go to Uncle’s house in the morning. It’s great that you came, come let’s have breakfast together. No, no, Uncle, 
I have had breakfast. I thought since you have come in morning,
we will have breakfast together, it has been so long I haven’t had
breakfast with you. Okay fine, let’s do one thing, we will have
 breakfast together but I will only have tea. yes, that’s like it. Do one think, go ask Alizeh and 
Afsheen to serve breakfast, yeah?
Okay. Stay blessed. Home becomes so lively 
when Ramsha comes here. Happiness spreads in this home 
by the smile of this girl, right? Thank God. Mom, what happened? 
The breakfast is not ready yet? I am getting late. Tabassum has gone on leave 
for 4 days, and Rasheeda’s daughter is not well. Let me order something for you 
from outside. You know that I don’t like outside food. then tell me what should I do? Umm Uncle was asking about breakfast. Rasheeda is on leaves so I thought of ordering something 
for her from outside. Okay don’t worry, I know what you guys have for 
breakfast, I will make it. Okay. See she immediately got a chance to earn 
brownie points in front of uncle. Ramsha? 
Yes? What are you doing here? I am making breakfast, Afnan. But why are you making breakfast, 
that’s not your job. It is not for you to do all this, 
where is Tabassum, where is aunt, she should have 
stopped you. Aunt? Aunt? Why are you calling Aunt, Afnan? who should I call if not her? I will ask her why are you 
working here? Aunt? Aunt, please listen to me. Afnan, what is wrong, listen to me, 
at least. There is no need to call aunt. It is not a big deal if I am making 
breakfast and Aunt felt like having fried flatbread 
made by me, that is why I am making it. Aunt felt like it? It is surprising, she never feels like having breakfast 
made by her daughter, why does she want to have it 
made by you? I am telling you she does all this 
on purpose to bother you. Forget it, Afnan, what’s the point? If you start arguing with aunt, 
it will ruin the breakfast atmosphere, and all my hard work will go to waste, the breakfast is almost done anyway. You go sit on the breakfast table,
I will serve it. Okay. Why do you do this, Ramsha? Exactly, brother, I stopped her so much but no,
she didn’t listen to me for once, she made the entire breakfast. I even said that you have come here 
for a while but no, when does she listen to me. Daughter, it was different before,
you used to live here, now you have come as a guest, what is the need to come 
and do all the work? It’s okay Uncle, 
it’s not that big of a deal. And Ramsha wouldn’t have servants 
in her home anyway, brother, she must be doing all the work herself. Dishes, breakfast, right Ramsha? So that is good, Afsheen, Good daughters are the one 
who adjust with the situation. You can’t by being selfish, you live it by being selfless. 
Stay blessed. Ramsha? 
Yes? Where are you going? To my home, where else will I go? Umm, you are going alone? Yes. Shani dropped me and 
went to the shop and Aunt has gone to a relative’s house, Annie is all alone at home 
so I will have to go alone. So, listen, let me drop you. No, no, I will manage myself, Afnan. Hey, I am going to the office only, your house is on my way, 
I will drop you, I am getting late, hurry up let’s go. But Afnan? 
What but Afnan? It doesn’t seem nice that you get 
bothered because of me like this. I will manage on my own 
by a taxi or a rickshaw, why are you bothering for no reason? And what if I say that I won’t be bothered 
but I will be glad, then? Oh okay, you are using your academy as an excuse
and going to meet Afnan, right? There is nothing like that, Alizeh, 
I am not going to meet Afnan. I am going to the academy 
with the driver. Don’t lie to me, Afnan just left for office a while back
 and now you are leaving too. You two cannot meet in front of me, that is why you have planned 
to meet behind my back, right? Look, I know you feel insecure 
regarding Ramsha, but I just want to clear that we just had
a temporary friendship between us which is not there anymore, 
it doesn’t exist at all. Afnan, I cannot share you with anyone,
 you know that, right? And that Ramsha wants to take you
away from me, I know. I know that very well. Please, you won’t leave me, Afnan, don’t leave me, 
I cannot live without you, I will go crazy I am telling you. Yes, yes Alizeh, I know that 
you love me a lot but trust me, I love you a lot too, I cannot even think about 
anyone except you and I promise you 
I will never leave you, please take out this insecurity 
from your heart, there is nothing between
I and Ramsha, I am yours, just yours. Greetings. 
Greetings. How are you Annie? I am fine. Where is aunt? She is inside, did Afnan drop you? yes, Afnan has dropped me. Why? Shall I ask you something? yes, go ahead. Don’t you feel weird facing Afnan? I mean that between you guys… I don’t have any answer to your question. The ones who do wrong to someone 
or betray someone, are scared. And I haven’t done anything with anyone. Why should I get scared or get nervous, I have never done wrong to anyone, 
that is why my heart is very satisfied. You are right, I am just thinking that I wish 
you could have gotten him. You know what, Annie? whatever happens,
happens for good. And a person should learn to agree 
with the decision of His God, then there will just be peace in life. I am very happy that you have started to trust in God. That’s a huge thing. Yes, trusting God is a huge blessing. When a person has faith in God, they become carefree. Now let’s go inside. 
come. so, you got the time? what do you mean? What was the need for you 
to drop Ramsha, Afnan? what is such a big deal 
if I dropped her? Why are you getting so angry? she came here with her husband, she should have gone back with him, 
why did you go to drop her? She asked you and you went? Dude, she didn’t ask me,
I offered her to drop her. yes, what is the need for her
to say anything anyway? When she is getting all the facilities 
without saying then why would she say anything? I have to ask you Afnan, and you show all your tantrums to me. Sometimes you are not in the mood, 
sometimes you don’t have time. Look, now you are fighting 
for no reason. I am not fighting for no reason, Ramsha gave me a reason to fight, but you never see any mistake of her, I am the one who is always at fault. You are not doing good to me, Afnan. Now why are you quiet? Why don’t you answer me? 
What should I say, dude? You have a problem when I answer 
you have a problem when I don’t answer, I don’t want to fight for no reason,
that is what I am trying to tell you. Is it something to fight about? I am avoiding a fight, nothing else. You shameless girl. Don’t you feel any shame? How can you betray us big time? Hey, what is wrong with you? 
Come with me and talk. What is wrong with me? Yes, yes, you will come 
to save your lover. What did you think? Both of you could have fooled me 
together and I will keep on tolerating? I wouldn’t be able to find out anything, Fahad has told me the whole truth. Alizeh, I have made coffee for you, have it, it will fix your mood. I don’t feel like having it. Why are you and Afnan always fighting? If Afnan makes a mistake, 
you must ignore. I should ignore? Mom, I feel that he hurts me 
on purpose so we are always just fighting. Alizeh, you guys are not kids anymore,
the way you fight. It has been a year to your marriage
 by the way, now you must think about 
completing your family. If there will be baby between you guys, both of you will end all your conflicts 
and get busy with the baby. And my child, a child makes the relationship of 
a husband and wife, stronger. Now you must think about this. what are you saying, mom? I am not planning a family at all 
for the next 2 3 years. So why not? It has been a year to your marriage, you must think about 
family planning now. Mom, I am thinking to do PHD, I thought I will give you a surprise 
by telling this but you don’t let anything be a 
surprise anymore. How much more will you study? 
You are already done studying. And whatever you want to do 
you are already doing it, enough now. Mom, please, I don’t want to talk 
on this topic anymore. And please mom, don’t discuss anything regarding this
in front of Afnan, he will immediately get a chance, he already loves babies. That is why I am saying, my love, 
think about babies. I have to make an important call, 
I am going to my room, excuse me. This girl always does what she wants, she doesn’t listen or understand things. She is the limit. Okay, go call Ramsha and 
Shani for breakfast. They haven’t come yet? 
Let me go check. What is wrong with you Ramsha, 
is it the time to sleep? Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha, get up. Mom? Mom? What is this? 
Mom? This is brother’s voice. 
Come. Mom, come up, come up, quickly. Ramsha? Ramsha, get up, what happened to her? 
Ramsha? What happened? Oh God, Oh God. 
Look what happened to her. Ramsha? 
What happened? Ramsha? I don’t know, she fainted. 
Ramsha? Ramsha. Shani, she was absolutely fine, tell me honestly 
what happened to her? God forbid, did you do something? I wasn’t in the room myself, 
I was at the roof. I came in and saw that 
she is in this condition. Shani, tell me honestly 
what happened to her? did you do something? 
I don’t know, check her. Ramsha? 
Open your eyes Ramsha? Ramsha? 
Ramsha, open your eyes. Shani? Mom, what happened to her, 
is she fine? It’s a good news, I will be a grandma, 
congratulations. What? 
Yes. Doctor has just said that 
Ramsha is very weak so take very good care of her and yes, doctor has written some medicines, go and get the medicines and 
meet Ramsha as well, go. I am so happy that I cannot believe it. That’s it, someone even younger than me 
is about to come to this home now, I will be very strict to him. But why I would be strict, 
I will love him so much, dude. You know how much I love babies. Yes, yes, madam, 
I remember it very well. Aunt, you that sister Safya, who had a little baby named Haris? Just for that baby she would get you 
to make good food and take it for them so 
she can play with that baby. And do you remember when that sister Safya left this area, 
how she was crying? You didn’t even cry that much 
when grandma passed away as much as you cried there. Yes, I remember it very well this girl 
created such a chaos, and that too because of someone else’s baby,
such small someone else’s baby. We couldn’t have kept him 
in our home, she was already a tenant here, 
she had to go. What a fool. She brings 
everyone’s babies. But I won’t have any tension now, no matter if its my nephew or niece, 
he will always be with me, there wouldn’t be any tension of him 
going away from me. yes, yes, you won’t have the tension
of him going anywhere but we are all tensed for you to leave. Where am I going? Umm, don’t you want to get married? You have to get married and 
go away from here. yes, Ramsha is right, if I get a good match for you today 
I will get you married today only. Mom, I don’t want to get married at all, and don’t say this to me for 
at least 3 years no matter how good of a match 
you get for me. Please. here, I have brought your medicines. Thank you. Okay now you guys rest. 
Let’s go, come. Okay. You scared me.
