[16.32] Alizeh Child,
[18.72] Ramsha needs a friend
right now and
[22.32] you are of her age,
[25.16] be her friend!
[26.32] Girls talk with their friends
with open hearts,
[30.36] which they may not be able
to do with everyone else.
[37.68] Look
[39.92] if she shares with you
what’s in her heart,
[47.72] then her heart will feel
less burdened.
[53.48] She has closed herself in her
room since her mother’s death,
[59.16] she has lost her spark,
she has become so quiet!
[63.68] Uncle you are right,
[66.68] I often see her crying only!
[74.96] If I speak the truth,
[76.72] I feel sympathy for her.
[80.32] That’s it, child!
[83.08] The loss of a mother is so painful.
[88.60] Maybe Ramsha was attached
to her mother just like I am!
[99.28] I cannot imagine
my life without Mama.
[110.12] If I ever come back from the
office and she is not home,
[112.64] I feel suffocated,
[115.24] the house feels empty without her
[120.08] I have a friend,
[121.84] he has a Punjabi poet
[124.88] “The house which has no mother,
[128.00] has no safety or warmth”.
[135.04] There are blessings in
the house due to mother,
[140.92] she is the one who stands by you!
[147.92] A person can at least vent
his feelings to his mother,
[156.00] A mother is the biggest support,
[159.28] there is no…
[162.40] we can at least share it!
[171.16] Greetings
[172.00] Hello child, come, sit child, sit,
[176.04] sit with Alizeh, sit!
[178.84] Talk to her, she makes friends quickly
[183.84] Uncle, I don’t feel like
talking to anyone,
[187.80] I just want to sleep all the time
[193.68] and go into a deep sleep,
[197.28] meet my mother in my dreams and
[200.16] that meeting never ends!
[202.72] May Allah give you life,
[204.48] may Allah (swt) give you patience,
[208.08] it is really hard to maintain patience,
[210.00] and that is why Allah (swt)
has kept a big reward for it!
[213.08] But Allah (swt) is always
with the ones who are patient
[218.24] Alizeh, you didn’t get ready?
[220.08] Are we not going?’
[221.16] Oh, sorry, I forgot
[223.28] Are you guys going somewhere?
[225.12] Yes Dad,
[227.32] we are going for our
wedding shopping.
[236.36] That is a good thing,
[238.16] why don’t you guys do one thing,
[239.44] take Ramsha along with you.
[250.28] Since she came into this house,
[251.88] she never left,
[253.68] if she goes outside,
she will feel better.
[256.76] Yes, Uncle is right,
[258.56] you should come with us,
[260.16] and we will have dinner as well,
[262.12] hmm?
[263.00] But dad….
[269.64] No, Alizeh you guys should go,
[272.16] I will go some other time,
not right now.
[276.12] Are you saying no because of Afnan?
[280.20] Don’t worry about him,
[282.40] he is like that,
[283.72] it takes him some time
to socialize with people.
[287.04] Afnan is my son but
[288.40] his nature is different than mine.
[291.60] Come,
[292.28] I am going to get ready,
you should get ready too.
[295.12] She is asking you so nicely,
go child, go!
[344.92] Afnan!
[345.56] Hey! I can’t understand anything,
[349.92] what was the need to take
that girl along with us?
[354.04] Afnan,
[354.92] uncle requested me to do it,
I couldn’t have refused him.
[357.64] Alizeh, this is mine and
your wedding shopping!
[363.00] People don’t take their
relatives or family members
[368.04] and we have to take
that girl along with us!
[370.12] Even if Ramsha comes with us,
[371.76] what issue do you have?
[373.04] I cannot tolerate her coming
in between you and me!
[376.48] I mean I cannot tolerate her coming
in between our shopping spree,
[379.16] what will she do there?
[381.36] Afnan, even I don’t want
anyone to come in between us
[385.12] but if Ramsha goes with us,
[386.96] nothing will happen!
[390.96] And look, if we don’t take her,
[392.88] then she will say something to uncle,
[394.04] and then you know
[395.00] chaos will be made.
[397.16] Look, fix your mood,
[399.12] what can happen if she
goes with us anyway?
[402.80] I don’t know, as you guys wish,
[404.96] I cannot say anything.
[408.40] Go and bring her now.
[445.52] Go bring her along
[447.56] Afnan,
[448.52] Hmmm
[449.00] what do you think of this dress?
[451.72] I don’t know,
[452.80] I don’t understand women’s
clothing anyway!
[457.76] Ramsha,
[460.44] come here for a minute
[462.92] What is the need to call Ramsha?
[465.08] You are not telling me anything,
[466.08] so I thought I should ask her.
[478.20] Ramsha
[478.96] what do you think about this dress?
[481.80] It’s nice, right?
[483.84] If you were in my place,
[485.28] would you have chosen something
like this dress for your wedding?
[494.68] Alizeh!
[500.80] What is wrong with you?
Are you in your senses?
[503.48] What are you saying to her?
[508.80] What happened Afnan?
[509.92] I am only asking a question,
[511.24] what did I say wrong?
[516.08] Tell me,
[516.96] if you were in my place,
would you have chosen this dress?
[522.28] She could have never
been in your place!
[529.64] And she never will be!
[554.68] Ignore him, you tell me,
[556.64] is this a nice dress?
[565.96] Alizeh, I don’t know what
type of dresses you wear,
[569.72] so do what you feel is best!
[587.12] Ramsha,
[588.04] you tell me, how do you
find this dress to be?
[590.84] Alizeh, I don’t need anything,
[592.28] thank you so much,
I have clothes.
[594.36] Ramsha, you will have
to buy something,
[596.92] uncle ordered me that
[598.56] since we are going shopping
[600.20] so I should buy you a dress
as well of your choice.
[601.80] Tell me, do you like this?
[603.32] No, I don’t want it.
[605.44] Do you want me to be
scolded by my uncle?
[607.76] If you like it then tell me,
[609.60] this colour will look good on you,
[611.32] look! here!
[614.32] Alizeh!
[615.92] yes
[616.48] What are you doing?
[618.40] I chose this dress for you and
[620.52] I have paid for it as well.
[637.36] Afnan,
[638.52] what is this behaviour?
[640.40] She must have felt so hurt
listening to what you said!
[642.60] So, what if she wore this dress?
[644.44] It is good that she heard,
[650.24] she should know that thing one
which only you have the right,
[654.24] she can never have it!
[662.92] Please buy whatever you want,
and come to the counter.
[695.96] Ramsha what do you
think about this dress?
[699.52] It’s nice, right?
[701.40] If you were in my place,
[702.64] would you have chosen something
like this dress for your wedding?
[705.40] She could have never
been in your place!
[707.84] And she never will be!
[750.92] Really? Hmm…
[751.72] Yes, but this is so beautiful,
[754.20] but Afnan tell me something, wait!
[757.12] This phone is so expensive,
[758.44] what was the need to give me this?
[759.72] You should take it back;
I cannot keep it!
[761.80] You will return me the gift?
[763.24] It is your birthday gift
[764.84] when I came to your
birthday party that day,
[766.76] I didn’t bring anything
because I was in a hurry,
[768.16] I didn’t like it
[769.64] and this has amazing video quality,
[773.52] it will come in handy for you!
[774.96] You are right,
[776.12] you know my phone got so old,
[778.20] I was thinking about
getting a new phone
[780.20] and then you gifted me one!
[781.56] How did you come to know?
[782.80] I just come to know everything!
[785.76] I was thinking about making
a lot of TikTok from this
[788.52] and selfies as well.
[790.04] Listen,
[791.80] where did you get these bangles from?
They are really beautiful.
[794.28] glass bangles!...
[796.04] So, what if it is made of glass?
[797.52] At least it looks good!
[799.12] Wow!
[799.96] Who loves glass bangles?
Only you like them.
[802.48] I like bangles on a woman’s hand,
[805.20] but in your hand,
they look special
[809.36] Thank you,
[810.04] from now onwards,
I will wear bangles daily
[813.68] This is your best quality;
[815.68] you listen to everything I say
[817.16] and agree to everything I say!
[886.32] Iqbal is a good advisor,
[888.24] fascinates the heart in moments,
[891.04] He did become hero in talk,
[893.08] but one in deeds he could not be.
[896.84] Though the mosque was
built overnight by the believers,
[900.92] our heart being old sinner
for years devout could not be.
[911.40] Oh, thank you!
[918.32] Afsheen, the kids went shopping,
[922.52] are they not back yet?
[925.84] Brother, you know it
is wedding shopping,
[928.56] it takes time.
[931.88] Alizeh has taken a lot of time,
[934.64] Ramsha is with her as well,
[936.00] the child must be getting worried!
[939.76] Brother, you sent Ramsha
with them for no reason.
[950.12] You know shopping takes time
[954.16] and these people are not
used to of going to malls!
[962.68] They go to the bazaar near
their neighbourhood,
[968.24] and shop for whatever they want…
[974.36] and you know
[976.16] Alizeh takes time when
she is shopping,
[978.56] what if Ramsha gets too tired?
[981.76] Okay,
[983.60] I will talk to Alizeh on the phone.
[995.36] Hello, Yes Alizeh child, all good?
[1001.44] Ramsha is fine, right?
[1004.44] Okay, okay, you guys enjoy,
[1007.20] so when will you return?
[1010.84] Okay, you guys’ shop,
[1013.08] and yes Alizeh!
[1015.56] Buy Ramsha some things
that she likes, okay?
[1021.84] Okay, in God’s hand!
[1024.60] I said the right thing,
right Afsheen,
[1026.16] hmm?
[1027.52] Yes, I will leave now brother
[1030.32] Okay
[1041.24] You guys planned the wedding
and didn’t even tell me,
[1043.72] that is so rude!
[1045.88] Yes, so what?
[1047.36] You went out of the country
and didn’t even call,
[1050.52] do you know how sick
mother got behind you?
[1054.36] That is why we had to
fix the date so suddenly!
[1057.04] What happened to Aunty?
[1058.28] How is she feeling now?
[1060.52] She is a lot better now,
Thank God!
[1063.16] But her blood pressure
got really high at that time,
[1066.36] that’s why we had to
decide all of this.
[1081.68] This girl…
[1106.00] Yes, I told you that
a guest is here of Uncle,
[1109.24] this is her!
[1110.80] But this is!
[1111.48] Fahad, Fahad!
[1114.64] Did you see her closely,
[1116.36] look at her closely,
[1117.24] doesn’t she resemble your cousin,
[1120.76] the one that lives in Islamabad?
[1125.04] Yes, yes,
[1126.20] she looks exactly like Farheen
[1128.00] Yes, her name was Farheen.
[1130.92] Look, the name just
skipped my mind!
[1139.36] Farheen?
[1141.08] Maybe, she might resemble,
[1142.88] faces to resemble, not a big deal!
[1145.52] Yes, they do, okay listen,
[1147.36] what are we doing?
[1149.12] Fahad wants to drink a
cup of coffee made by you,
[1152.92] he was asking for it for a while,
[1154.40] so please make a nice
cup of coffee for him,
[1156.32] right Fahad?
[1158.80] Yes, yes
[1160.08] Okay, I’ll make it
[1161.96] Hmm…
[1167.88] What was this?
[1168.72] Shush!
[1170.32] What is this girl doing here?
[1172.56] Does it mean that the accident
she had with Uncle Qasim’s car,
[1175.48] was that all your planning?
[1177.96] Have you lost it?
[1179.68] Do you think I can plan like this?
[1183.40] Listen to me carefully,
[1185.76] Me and Ramsha had
any sort of contact
[1189.48] or know each other,
[1191.96] no one in the house knows this
[1193.52] and please Fahad,
[1194.76] no one should know about this,
[1196.04] otherwise I will be in a lot of trouble!
[1204.72] Now sit down.
[1212.24] Don’t overreact to things
[1299.76] Hello Ramsha…
[1315.00] did you recognize me?
[1318.48] Of course,
[1320.40] how can you forget this face?
[1340.36] Will you be my friend?
[1361.72] Look Afnan is already
getting married,
[1364.96] he will not even think
about you after the wedding!
[1370.72] Then what will you do?
[1373.64] You will be all alone and bored…
[1379.56] that’s why I am asking you to be a friend.
[1382.96] Hey, wait!...
[1384.00] Move out of my way!
[1385.76] I am talking about coming closer,
[1388.40] I mean
[1389.96] our hearts will come closer
once we are friends
[1394.20] and you are pushing me away…
[1396.84] look, Ramsha,
[1400.60] trust me
[1403.24] I will take you on much better
adventures than Afnan!
[1411.64] Disgusting human!
[1433.56] When did you come?
[1440.12] It’s been a while since I came!
[1443.60] What happened, all good?
[1445.96] Your face looks a bit weird to me…
[1449.32] No, no there is nothing like that
[1454.56] I brought some dresses for Afnan,
[1457.20] come I will show you as well
[1458.08] Right now?
[1459.88] I am in a bit of a hurry right now,
[1461.52] I have to go somewhere…
[1463.08] I will come back later..
[1505.92] What do these guys think I am?
[1508.04] Am I a stolen good, a free thing that
[1510.04] anyone will do anything with me?
[1512.88] Am I left to worry about
all these things now?
[1516.68] I don’t know what they think of me,
[1519.44] just because I don't have parents,
[1520.64] doesn't give them the right to take
advantage of my helplessness…
[1524.68] I will not let this happen!
[1526.44] I will not let this happen at all!
[1530.44] I don’t know why they all are
doing these things to me!
[1536.52] I will not give up,
[1538.48] I will not give up hope!
[1540.00] I will give them a good reply…
[1562.08] Dad, these are
the girl hostel’s forms
[1564.92] about which I talked with you,
[1566.96] the manager there is my friend
[1570.20] if you agree
[1571.64] then this girl can shift there,
this Sunday
[1575.92] Brother, Afnan is absolutely right,
[1578.32] till when will we keep this girl here?
[1586.76] Afsheen,
[1590.08] my heart is not ready
to send this girl
[1594.64] into the hands of a stranger
[1601.76] Dad, what has happened to you?
[1603.32] Try to understand what
I am saying…
[1609.96] one day that girl has to go,
[1612.12] she cannot stay here forever!
[1618.32] Then for whom are you
making her stay here?
[1621.56] Listen to me Dad,
[1623.32] it is not okay for her to stay here…
[1635.12] strengthen your heart and
[1636.96] believe what I am saying,
[1638.92] that girl will be absolutely
safe in the girls’ hostel!
[1646.60] yes Brother, absolutely right,
[1649.04] And it is not like she will
stay at the hostel alone,
[1651.88] you can visit her
[1653.44] and I will keep a check
on her by calling her,
[1656.28] and the biggest thing,
[1657.64] Afnan’s friend over there,
is in charge
[1661.72] so he can give us the
update every minute!
[1667.24] Afsheen, whatever it is!
[1668.88] I cannot hand over the girl to
someone else just like that!
[1686.08] I am thinking about marrying her…
[1702.40] look, nikkah is the only relation that
[1704.24] can provide her with
complete protection…
[1706.68] do one thing,
[1708.20] find a suitable proposal to marry her…
[1713.44] What, me?
[1720.76] Yes Afsheen,
[1722.68] you can take care of such
responsibility better,
[1725.24] look, this way the girl
will be sent to a safe hand!
[1728.72] She will go to her home,
[1731.96] it will make me feel like
[1733.24] I have redeemed my mistakes,
[1735.00] okay?
[1743.24] Phuppo, Dad is right,
[1745.92] if that girl gets married,
[1747.76] there won’t be a better
solution than this!
[1780.80] What kind of responsibility
br0ther has given me!
[1784.72] Where shall I wed this girl?
[1788.20] Who will marry this
girl from my circle,
[1792.80] I don’t know how to make
brother understand...
[1797.92] Sir is doing such a big charity work,
[1800.76] he is marrying an orphan,
support-less girl,
[1803.56] it has a huge reward!
[1808.68] Tabassum,
[1810.12] if there is a good proposal from
your relatives then let me know..
[1816.88] Even if the boy works in a factory
[1819.40] and has a minimum wage,
[1821.44] just let me know…
[1823.08] Ma’am, I know some
women who bring proposals,
[1825.92] I will talk to them as
well as my Aunt,
[1829.32] she also brings proposals…
[1832.80] Okay…
[1838.92] Phuppo,
[1840.72] Hmm
[1841.68] where is Aleezay,
[1843.40] I have been looking for her
for quite some time
[1844.56] but I don’t think she has
come back from the office yet…
[1849.72] Phuppo, make her understand,
[1851.76] that she should have taken
an off from the office by now
[1853.64] otherwise how will we
prepare for the wedding?
[1857.08] Hmm…
[1858.48] Aleezay took an off from
the office a few days ago…
[1862.48] she just went to a
birthday party right now…
[1865.84] what was the name?
[1868.64] Yes, someone named Salman,
[1870.52] she went there…
[1874.80] Okay, I will call her...
[1885.56] What are you saying?
[1886.80] I am absolutely right,
[1889.00] Ma’am has asked me to 
look for your proposals,
[1892.52] Sir wants you to get married 
as soon as possible.
[1895.88] I have so many good proposals...
[1897.92] I can tell you a very good one,
[1900.40] other than that my aunt 
also brings proposals,
[1902.64] she has some good proposals,
[1904.64] I have fixed marriages
 before as well
[1906.80] and I will find the 
best proposal for this one…
[1909.32] This cannot happen, 
I have to talk to Uncle!
[1911.08] listen! Ramsha Ma’am!
[1912.72] Here look,
[1913.16] they have sent the 
details of the rooms,
[1915.00] they are big and clean
[1916.92] Uncle!
[1917.64] Hmm…
[1918.48] I cannot marry uncle…
[1927.20] You can make me 
the servant of this house,
[1929.04] give me a place in 
the servant quarter
[1930.80] but don’t force me to get married,
[1933.28] I am begging you!
[1934.60] I don’t want to get married Uncle…
[1936.88] What happened child,
[1937.60] who told you that
 we are marrying you off forcefully,
[1940.40] why are you so worried 
regarding marriage?
[1950.20] sit here, here, 
sit comfortably! Carefully,
[1955.76] there is no need to 
cry over this, here,
[1958.08] drink some water…
[1959.88] good!
[1968.64] Here, give me…
[1972.32] What happened?
[1974.64] How can you think that
[1976.92] we will marry you off 
without taking into regard your decision?

[2101.44] Hi…
[2104.16] When I told you not
[2106.12] to go to Salman’s birthday,
[2108.20] then why did you go?
[2111.16] What happened Afnan?
[2112.72] Why are you talking to me like this?
[2114.84] I can talk to you however way I want,
[2116.56] just answer my question…
[2118.08] I told you not to go
[2119.48] but you don’t care about me,
[2121.04] there is no value of 
mine in front of you!
[2122.96] Afnan, please,
[2125.20] if you don’t care about 
your respect,
[2126.80] at least care for mine,
[2128.32] I servant is standing here!
[2129.52] You care about the servant…
[2130.72] you don’t care about me at all?
[2132.44] When I told you not to
 go than why did you go?
[2135.28] What are you looking at?
 Go away from here…
[2138.88] and you!
[2140.40] There are some months
 left in the wedding,
[2142.16] get your brain checked
[2143.60] Don’t talk rubbish with me!!
[2146.40] am asking you the same
 question again and again
[2148.68] and you are not answering me,
[2150.36] when I told you that
[2151.72] you will not go to
 Salman’s birthday
[2153.40] than how dare you go there?
[2155.92] Urooj invited me,
[2157.48] so what if I went there?
[2158.88] She is my friend,
[2159.68] she would have gotten
 upset with me
[2160.64] You care about Urooj’s anger
[2162.64] but you don't care if I get mad!
[2164.84] Don’t argue with me…
[2167.20] I don’t want to argue with you!
[2169.44] We are about to get married…
[2171.64] and I refused you!
[2173.12] Just answer me this
[2174.80] when I told you not to go
 then why did you go?
[2176.16] What has happened to you?
[2177.68] In what tone are you 
talking to me?
[2179.40] Whatever tone 
I am talking to you in,
[2181.76] why are you not 
answering my question?
[2183.72] When I forbid you to go there,
[2185.12] then why did you go
 to Salman’s birthday?
[2187.32] Why are you repeating 
the same thing again and again…
[2189.28] “I told you not to”...
 “I told you not to”,
[2190.40] so what if I went there,
[2191.56] what can I do now?
[2192.88] And tell me
[2194.12] will you be doing this 
after marriage as well?
[2195.88] Yes, I will do this!
[2197.36] And you will have to agree to me,
[2200.24] you can do whatever 
you want about it!
[2201.88] Okay then…
[2204.68] you don't want a wife, 
you want a servant
[2206.36] and I cannot become a servant…
 keep this ring to yourself!
