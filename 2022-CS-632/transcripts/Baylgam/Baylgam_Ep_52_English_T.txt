[23.04] Come in.
[25.92] Greetings uncle.
[27.00] Greetings.
[31.32] You had called me?
[32.84] Yes, child,
[35.92] I didn’t get a chance to talk to you
 in the wedding preparation.
[47.12] You tell me, are you happy?
[72.24] Ramsha, I am asking 
you something, child.
[77.52] Tell me.
[79.12] Are you happy? 
Is everything okay?
[81.92] Yes, uncle.
[83.20] Look
[85.04] child, nothing will be 
done against your will,
[87.88] and no one will force
 you for anything.
[91.64] Not even me.
[101.88] You tell me,
[102.60] what does your heart say?
[103.96] What is your will?
[105.12] You are happy, right?
[107.36] Yes, uncle,
[109.68] nowadays,
 I really miss, mama.
[112.20] So I felt like crying.
[116.00] Daughters miss their 
mother in such situations.
[121.96] God bless,
[123.00] if sister Mehnaz was alive,
[124.56] she would have taken 
care of all the matters.
[138.40] Pray for her forgiveness.
[146.12] In fact,
[147.24] I would say that you increase
 your good deeds.
[158.64] Your parents will get blessed for 
every single good deed you go.
[175.68] Good children are continuous
 charity for the parents.
[180.88] Yes, you are right uncle.
[184.00] Stay happy.
[187.40] One minute. One minute.
[193.68] I wanted that
[196.92] you make some preparations 
by your choice for the wedding.
[209.00] No, uncle. I cannot take this.
[217.00] You have done me so many favors,
[219.92] I don’t need anything else.
[230.00] Child, who said that
[232.44] I am doing a favor on you?
[245.56] You know,
[248.88] I really wished,
[250.28] in fact, I prayed to God that
[252.72] if He blesses me with a daughter,
[254.44] I will do all this.
[277.24] So, think that doing all this,
[280.12] I am fulfilling my wish.
[304.28] And this is not from an
 uncle for her niece,
[308.68] think that
[309.88] this is a present from your 
father for his daughter.
[326.92] I hope you will not say no.
[349.88] I cannot even repay the favor of 
your love on me, even if I want to.
[355.72] Fathers don’t do
 favors on daughters, child.
[364.84] They love them.
[366.12] They pray for their good fate.
[369.08] Just live long, always stay happy.
[370.48] Yes, uncle.
[413.24] When will you get ready?
[420.16] It is time for the guests to come.
[422.40] Mama,
[423.72] I don’t understand
[425.44] why uncle is spending so 
much on this girl’s wedding?
[439.60] I mean, what is the 
need for this function?
[449.64] He spent on the jewellery, 
he spent on the dowry,
[452.36] and now this useless expense?
[459.16] He should have married
 her with simplicity.
[462.40] This was the insistence 
of Ramsha’s in-laws.
[471.56] They had said they 
would do all the functions.
[473.92] You know,
[474.92] brother was even against the Mayun.
[477.32] Leave it mama,
[478.72] if it was in uncle’s control,
[480.28] he would give half his
 wealth in her dowry.
[484.60] If you and I will say something,
[486.32] then brother would mind it.
[494.16] So it is better that you just get ready.
[496.92] Sorry mama,
[498.04] neither will I get ready,
[499.16] nor will I be part 
of these functions.
[509.00] When they were 
spending so much,
[510.56] then they should have 
a function in a good hall.
[518.64] What was the need to invite 
them at home?
[523.00] The entire family go 
around in the home freely.
[526.04] Hey, listen to me.
[527.88] Even if for ten minutes,
[529.40] but you will have to come.
[530.88] You know brother,
[532.48] he will get upset.
[534.04] Mama, you cannot pressurize me.
[536.92] My love, I am not pressurizing you.
[539.88] I am just telling you that
[542.16] at times a person
[543.92] has to go against their will.
[546.40] Understand this,
[548.08] please.
[553.40] Get ready quickly and come.
[555.28] I am waiting.
[568.36] May God protect you 
from the evil eye.
[573.52] Here,
[574.84] remove the evil eye of your 
son with five hundred.
[593.84] Afnan, where are you going?
[597.00] I have to talk to Ramsha.
[599.20] What do you want to talk about?
[600.56] I will tell you. I just want to
 talk for two minutes.
[602.36] Listen to me,
[603.84] leave her.
[605.08] All her relatives are there,
[607.16] what do you have to do there?
[623.28] You concentrate on me, leave her.
[625.04] Tell me, how do I look?
[626.68] You look really good. Really good.
[628.80] You like such clothes,
[630.52] so I got this dress made.
[662.04] We will get rid of her soon.
[666.56] Anyway, do you want something?
[722.20] You should have stayed a little longer.
[724.44] My child,
[725.76] you know Annie is not well,
[728.36] she is alone at home.
[729.36] After all, I have to do a lot
 for the function tomorrow.
[732.24] You know I have to do it alone.
[735.12] It is just a matter of some time.
[736.32] Once I come,
[737.48] I will get all the work done with you.
[739.20] Oh my child.
[742.24] You are coming as my daughter in law,
[743.88] that is enough for me.
[744.96] I don’t have to make you work.
[748.76] The car is here.
[750.12] Okay child, let’s go.
[752.80] Bye.
[753.84] Bye. Come on, let’s go.
[756.12] Okay, we will go.
[768.40] Mama. Papa.
[769.40] Yes?
[771.08] You people go sit in the car,
[774.20] I will just come.
[774.84] I feel I left my mobile inside.
[777.72] You know nothing about this boy.
[812.52] Ramsha.
[814.96] I made an excuse to mama and came,
[818.32] that I left my mobile here.
[820.12] You still haven’t left, Shani?
[846.36] What are you doing, Shani?
[847.12] Someone will see us.
[848.00] Hey, why are you doing this?
[856.92] You are acting like I am a stranger.
[864.52] We will get married tomorrow.
[868.12] We are going to get married Shani,
[869.72] we are not married yet.
[872.12] You leave from here.
[873.88] Hey, why are you showing
 useless tantrums?
[887.36] These tantrums of yours…
[890.68] I had come here to talk
 to you about love,
[894.20] and you are showing 
me tantrums.
[898.44] I had thought you had 
mended your ways.
[905.92] You have not changed
 even a little.
[915.56] If you make me understand 
something with love,
[918.24] then I will understand a thousand
 things from you, not just one.
[921.44] Stay in your limits Shani.
[923.12] Don’t you understand it once?
[931.88] Go from here.
[932.84] Everyone will see.
[934.60] Leave.
[936.76] Why are you acting so pure?
[939.36] Huh?
[940.96] Have you forgotten your past?
[945.00] I knew it.
[946.32] I knew that you are a lowlife.
[948.76] Yes, I am a lowlife.
[949.84] You recognized me well.
[962.24] And after marriage,
[963.20] you will understand that 
I am not just a lowlife,
[966.12] in fact, I am cheap too.
[967.68] Because I remember everything,
[971.84] and I will take my revenge
 for everything.
[975.84] What did they used to call you?
[979.36] Shopping girl.
[1068.08] What happened?
 Do you want something?
[1070.36] Me?
[1077.36] You.
[1084.04] Have you gone mad?
[1086.24] Are you in your senses?
[1090.12] What did you say?
[1095.68] You know I realized
 something today.
[1100.88] You are beautiful,
[1104.64] but you look even more
 beautiful with wet hair.
[1118.88] My issue is that as much
 as I dislike you,
[1123.00] I like you.
[1125.48] Shani, get lost from here
 in two minutes
[1129.04] or else I will teach you a lesson
[1130.72] you will not forget all your life.
[1133.04] What will you do?
[1135.16] What will you do?
[1136.56] Have you gone mad?
[1137.84] I am telling you, leave me or
[1139.08] I will do something with you that
[1140.40] you will remember.
[1141.08] What will you do?
[1142.12] You don’t agree?
[1143.12] You don’t get it? 
You wont leave me?
[1160.40] Anyway, don’t worry.
[1164.72] I am here with you, child,
[1166.16] so you don’t need to worry at all,
[1168.44] and no one will take 
you out of this home.
[1172.68] Had you told me this 
earlier, then
[1175.92] you wouldn’t have had to 
go through this test.
[1178.64] I wanted to tell you,
[1181.68] but uncle, I couldn’t 
gather the courage.
[1184.76] I felt that
[1186.28] if I tell you
[1187.96] and you don’t believe me, then
[1190.32] what would happen to me?
[1195.64] Anyway, you don’t need 
to be scared now,
[1198.20] and don’t worry. Okay?
[1222.52] Madam Ramsha
[1223.28] Yes?
[1223.76] Madam is asking
[1224.96] if you have made preparations
 to go to the parlor.
[1226.44] Have you kept your things?
[1228.08] Yes.
[1229.60] Tell aunt, I have kept everything.
[1232.20] Fine, I will tell her.
[1247.28] Do you have any idea
[1248.64] how depressed you 
have made brother?
[1252.16] Earlier, you ruined the relation
 between Afnan and Alizay,
[1255.68] and now you are making the 
father fight with the son.
[1261.44] No. I didn’t listen to Afnan earlier,
[1263.92] and neither will I agree to him in future.
[1269.64] I was just going to tell uncle, that
[1271.48] I am ready to go to that home.
[1282.56] Ramsha, I want to talk to you
 about something important.
[1285.52] I don’t want to talk to 
you about anything.
[1287.48] Please Ramsha,
 listen to me.
[1291.52] I told you,
[1293.12] I don’t want to talk 
to you about anything,
[1302.44] nor do I want to listen to you,
[1303.84] then why are you bothering me?
[1305.40] Look, answer me,
[1307.88] I promise you, after that 
I wont disturb you.
[1318.96] Give me the answer for a few
 questions of mine, that’s it.
[1322.28] I have no answer…
[1324.00] Ramsha.
[1327.20] Ramsha, I will have to go,
[1328.72] I will talk to you later.
[1337.24] Ramsha.
[1339.48] Yes, aunt?
[1341.20] Ramsha, did you keep 
all the things?
[1343.28] yes.
[1345.28] Check once more.
[1346.60] What if you leave something,
[1348.00] then you will have to come again.
[1349.76] Nothing is left aunt,
[1351.44] I have kept everything.
[1354.04] Fine. Come on, then.
[1417.96] Did you see?
[1419.96] Mr. Qasim gave such 
amazing dowry.
[1422.60] The whole neighbourhood 
was looking.
[1425.16] He just gave a little small furniture.
[1429.96] Hey, I told him not to.
[1437.08] Those people were getting a
 really big set of the furniture.
[1440.12] Ramsha had even sent me pictures.
[1442.84] What?
[1444.76] You told her not to?
[1446.76] Yes, yes, I said no,
[1448.68] that hey, what will we do 
with such big furniture
[1455.84] when it wont fit in the room?
[1458.12] You are such an stupid woman.
[1465.76] You should have taken it.
[1468.20] You surprise me.
[1472.20] Hey, after some time,
[1473.92] we would have given
 the big furniture set,
[1475.40] and got a small one made,
[1476.72] we would have got some money.
[1478.76] Mr. Qasim has already 
done so much,
[1482.92] we should be thankful for it.
[1493.64] You know, if I speak the truth,
[1494.92] even if brother Sajid was there,
[1496.52] he wouldn’t have been able to 
do so much for Ramsha.
[1498.88] Hey, what do they say?
[1503.20] The party has just begun.
[1514.84] You wait and watch,
[1517.12] what happens next.
[1525.04] I feel Mr. Qasim
[1527.12] will give a high level thing that 
suits him in the wedding gift.
[1533.36] I have told Shani,
[1536.84] if he asks you,
[1538.28] then feel shy and ask for a car.
[1542.24] Hey, what are you saying?
[1550.92] Would it look nice
 asking for it like this?
[1563.64] Tsk. Tsk. What will he
 think about us,
[1567.40] that we are such greedy people.
[1574.84] You know, if I say 
something, Anwar,
[1576.84] Shani’s position in Mr. Qasim’s 
eyes is not that good.
[1587.44] Whatever respect is left,
[1589.32] will end with us asking for things.
[1595.20] You know, you are right.
[1598.08] If Shani asks for a car 
shamelessly before marriage,
[1603.28] then he will get degraded 
in Mr. Qasim’s eyes.
[1611.60] After all, we should
 have the eggs,
[1616.08] and not slaughter the chicken.
[1618.84] You are right.
[1622.92] Is that my phone ringing?
[1625.04] Where is my phone?
[1625.88] It is over there.
[1631.20] I don’t know when this
 man’s greed will end.
[1635.08] This is the limit.
[1636.32] May God guide him, and put 
some sense in him.
[1639.84] I am tired of his greed.
[1652.08] Yes?
[1652.44] Sir, she left.
[1654.16] Where did she go?
[1655.52] She went to the parlor to get ready.
[1659.16] Fine, you leave.
[1670.32] Okay tell me,
[1671.56] why are you worried?
[1672.72] Thank God you didn’t say 
why are you worrying me,
[1675.40] or else my heart would have broken.
[1677.00] Really?
[1678.36] You have such a weak heart?
[1680.40] Yes,
[1681.24] it is a little extra weak in your case.
[1683.40] Okay,
[1684.24] I will test you some time.
[1686.76] No, no, Afnan, don’t do 
anything like that,
[1690.68] I will not be able to tolerate it.
[1696.84] Because, I too am thinking now that
[1700.56] I stop talking to you.
[1703.80] Hey, why?
[1708.08] What?
[1709.20] What are you thinking? Speak up.
[1715.08] I am thinking that
[1717.04] if I had not come to 
meet you, then
[1720.56] would have you really 
stopped talking to me?
[1722.80] Yes, I would have surely 
stopped talking to you.
[1724.92] You don’t meet me,
 nor talk to me,
[1726.88] then why should 
I talk to you.
[1728.60] After all, so many 
days have passed,
[1731.16] now you should 
understand me well.
[1739.12] I am thinking.
[1741.40] Whenever I have called 
you in trouble, you come.
[1746.56] The problem is, you get 
into trouble a lot.
[1751.68] You wont get into any 
other trouble, right?
[1754.72] If I get stuck, you are there.
[1758.92] You will never learn.
[1763.08] and the police put 
the entire blame on me.
[1766.20] I don’t know what
 I would have done,
[1767.84] had you not come?
[1768.64] I don’t know what 
I would have done,
[1770.92] Ramsha, how could I not come?
[1777.64] It was you.
[1779.64] I had to come for you at any cost.
[1785.36] And I know, you have
 not done anything.
[1788.32] You are being framed 
in this matter.
[1793.60] But I am with you, Ramsha.
[1796.80] I will not leave you alone 
in this difficult time.
[1831.44] Afnan.
[1832.24] Yes?
[1832.92] Where are you lost?
[1834.84] You didn’t even take out 
clothes for the wedding.
[1839.80] Tell me, I will take it out.
[1842.20] Yes, take out anything.
[1844.80] What do you mean 
I take out anything?
[1846.16] You will tell me,
[1846.88] and I will take out the 
same clothes.
[1849.08] I am telling you,
[1850.60] whatever clothes you pick 
for me, I will wear them.
[1852.36] No issues.
[1855.24] Afnan, I am seeing that 
you are not happy.
[1865.80] You are not participating i
n any activity of the wedding,
[1868.72] you are not taking interest
 in anything.
[1879.72] What is the issue?
[1881.36] I feel that you
[1883.16] are not happy in 
Ramsha’s wedding.
[1893.04] In fact, you are sad that 
she is leaving this home.
[1895.88] I do feel sad.
[1904.96] Not because Ramsha 
is getting married,
[1915.12] but because she is marrying Shani.
[1918.64] I don’t think Shani is 
worthy of Ramsha in anyway.
[1921.48] He doesn’t deserve her.
[1923.44] You see yourself,
[1929.32] Ramsha is so well mannered,
[1931.52] will he ever be able
 to keep her happy?
[1932.92] This will never happen,
 that is why,
[1935.52] yes I have no happiness 
of this wedding.
[1939.80] Shani is her choice.
[1946.92] She is marrying out of her will.
[1954.56] She is getting married,
[1955.72] he is her cousin,
[1956.56] why do you have an issue?
[1959.12] I knew it.
[1961.48] I knew you would never
 be able to understand this,
[1972.28] because you only 
care about yourself.
[2046.52] Yes, Jamshed, where are you?
[2049.84] No. No. No. You do one thing,
[2051.68] you go straight to the hall
[2054.68] I will pick Ramsha myself.
[2057.68] Yes, I am saying go to the hall,
[2060.80] I will pick her and bring her.
[2063.20] Fine. Immediately. 
Reach there immediately.
[2100.32] You?
[2103.00] Yes, the driver was busy,
[2107.24] so I thought I would pick you.
[2111.16] Come on.
[2114.00] Come on.
[2226.88] I had to talk to you about
 something important.
[2231.40] I didn’t get a chance, so
[2234.16] I thought I would pick you up.
[2260.08] Ramsha,
[2265.36] do you like Shani?
[2268.12] What sort of a question 
is this, Afnan?
[2277.60] Obviously, I like him,
 that is why I am marrying him.
[2282.96] You are lying.
[2291.72] I don’t believe this. You are lying.
[2299.16] You don’t like Shani.
[2304.40] Maybe you don’t know Ramsha,
[2308.08] I had heard everything you and Shani 
talked about on the day of the mayun.
[2322.16] How can you marry him 
even after all this?
[2330.76] Look, you try and understand me,
[2332.96] I want your betterment, 
I want good for you.
[2335.48] If you were marrying a good man,
[2337.56] if you were doing it by your choice.
[2339.20] Such a man who would 
keep you happy,
[2341.24] with whom you
 would stay happy,
[2342.52] then I wouldn’t say all 
this to you, Ramsha.
[2348.96] But Shani?
[2353.52] I cannot tolerate his
 behavior towards you,
[2356.40] then how will you tolerate it?
[2360.00] I am not answerable to 
you for everything, Afnan.
[2372.88] Just know that
[2375.96] some helplessness are
 the shackles in a person’s foot.
[2387.12] After all, it is really late,
[2389.56] we should go now.
[2390.24] Drive the car, please.
[2393.16] But I will not let you 
get married to him.
[2397.92] You are getting married 
out of helplessness,
[2400.56] but after this marriage 
your life can get ruined,
[2403.24] and I will not let you ruin your life.
[2406.44] You will not get married, that’s it.
[2409.60] You are not driving the car?
[2410.76] No, I wont go.
[2412.36] Fine. I will go myself.
[2414.20] Okay. Okay. Listen to me, please.
[2415.92] Close the door of the car.
[2422.16] What are you doing?
[2424.20] Whatever I am doing is
 for your betterment.
[2429.12] Why don’t you understand me,
 Ramsha.
[2432.84] Nor can I take you to the hall,
[2434.44] neither can I let you get off here.
[2440.40] How do I let you get off?
[2441.48] You will get off from the 
car at this hour of the night,
[2443.76] dressed up like this, as a bride,
[2445.36] and you feel I will leave you 
in the middle of the road?
[2447.44] Really?
[2450.00] I think you have forgotten.
[2459.28] You had left me midway like this earlier.
[2462.68] If I am marrying Shani, then
[2465.16] why are you worried?
[2467.24] If I stand midway,
 in the middle of the road,
[2469.80] then why do you worry?
[2471.36] Why?
[2473.64] Because…
