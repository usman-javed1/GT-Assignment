Thank you. Greetings dad.
Greetings. How are you feeling now? The one who will have such
a caring daughter, tell me, how would he feel? See for yourself, I am fine. I have not done anything in this uncle. I feel more than the medication,
it is your good deeds that are of use to you right now. You recovered so quickly in a few days. God has specially blessed you. Without a doubt, it is God who blesses.
I am just an ordinary man, my good deeds are nothing. He is the one who gives us
the opportunity. Were you going to the office, Afnan? Yes, dad, I am going. I will change in a little while. I had not gone for a few days,
so I thought I would get an update today. You do one thing, you drop Ramsha
to her academy. She has not been going to the academy
for so many days. No uncle, I will join from tomorrow, not today. No, no, child, you don’t take
any more offs, your studies are already suffering. You go and get ready, he too will take some time
to get ready, okay? Yes, yes, dad, I will surely drop her. Get ready. I am going to have breakfast
after getting ready. I am fine. Go, come on, go. You will take care of yourself?
Yes, God is there to take care of me. Fine, then.
Come on, go. Live long. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Thank God. Can I say something, Ramsha? You have changed yourself. Not me, my God changed me. Yes. Seeing you I feel that
God has changed you. Because if I tell you the truth, I don’t believe this is the same Ramsha, who I had seen for the first time
some time back. The one I had known for the first time. That Ramsha was running somewhere
to get something in the race of life. She didn’t care about anyone. She only wanted to fulfill her wishes. Or it would be better if I say that in this hustle and bustle of life, she had gotten so busy, that
she had lost sleep from her life. Maybe she had no peace in her life. You are right. You don’t find peace in yourself. In fact, you get it after connecting
with God. I have understood this, that the stronger you connect the relation
between you and God, the more peace you will find. Do you know? When you love your God, when you strengthen
your relation with Him, then God too loves you. He cares for your love, He doesn’t let you get defamed. And on the other side, if you love a person so much, then they insult and defame you. They don’t care about love, they only bring you shame. You know well, I have suffered
through all of this. You are embarrassing me. No, there is nothing like that. I didn’t mean to do that.
I am really sorry, if you didn’t like it. I was just telling you my experience. Yes, but remember one thing. Whatever happens, there is betterment in it for us. Without a doubt. There is betterment in everything
God does. Thank you. Come in. Little madam. Yes?
Sir is here. He even had flowers in his hands. Really? You go ahead, I will come. Greetings.
Greetings. I was coming to you. Actually, I wanted to… What happened? Is all okay?
Are uncle okay? He is absolutely fine. He is fine and also really happy. Thank God.
This is for you. What was the need for this, Afnan? Why was there no need? You served dad so much,
you cared for him so much. Even if someone his own was
in your place, they wouldn’t have been able
to care for him like this. Because of you dad is healthy today,
he is happy. So I thought I would give you
these flowers to thank you. Thank you, but there was no need
for this, Afnan. Uncle is my well wisher. This is your greatness that you are accepting
that dad has done some favours on you. Or else, today, neither do people accept that someone
did favor on them, nor anyone’s goodness. But I am sure that the good deed
you have done, God will reward you for it. Thank you.
Welcome. Hello. Did you bring something for me? No, did I have to bring something? No, just like that. Anything. Hey, if you wanted anything, you should have told me,
I would have brought it. No, like you had thought of
a surprise or something. Surprise? Is it your birthday? No.
I understand, it is my birthday today, right? No, Afnan. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, it must be our wedding anniversary,
right? How can it be our wedding anniversary? We have not been married for a year. Exactly, when there is no occasion
out of the three of these, then what surprise? And what did I have to get?
If you want something, then give me a call.
I will bring it. Yes? I… What happened?
Are you going somewhere? Me? No. Why? No, you still haven’t changed,
you are ready the same way, so… I dressed up for yourself. If you don’t like it, then I will change… Hey, no, when did I say that? You look really pretty. You look really cute. Dress up. Okay listen, I have not met dad,
I will go meet him and come. Okay? Oh God, King of Kings, you give whoever You want an estate, and you snatch it from
whoever You want. You give respect to who You want, and You snatch respect from
whoever you want. Oh God, all the qualities are in Your hands. You control everything. God, the man who insulted
and humiliated me, today You got me respect from him. God, I couldn’t even imagine that
you are so beneficent and kind. God, which favours of Yours
do I thank you for. My really bless your servants, My lord. You really love your servants
more than seventy mothers. Thank you so much, God.
Thank you so much. Alizay, child give me my medication. Yes, uncle. Okay tell me, what medication do you take?
I will bring them. Hey, child I don’t know
what medications I take. Ramsha always gives them to me.
Ask her. Okay, I will ask her. Thank you. Ramsha. Yes? Ramsha, tell me, what medication
do we have to give uncle. In fact, do one thing,
give him his medication yourself. He has eaten food, he will rest. Fine, I will give him his medication. Little madam.
Yes? Sir is here. He even had flowers in his hands. Really? You go ahead, I will come. Surprise? Is it your birthday? No. I understand, it is my birthday today,
right? No, Afnan. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, it must be our wedding anniversary,
right? How can it be our wedding anniversary? We have not been married for a year.
Exactly, when there is no occasion
out of the three of these, then what surprise? Yes. Yes.
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Yes, yes, it will reach. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Okay. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Shani. Shani. Yes, papa? Listen, Mr. Qasim called. You have to go his home
in the afternoon tomorrow. He will give you a cheque,
you have to bring it. Tomorrow?
yes. Papa, arrange it for day after tomorrow. Tomorrow I have to go with Umair
for something important. What are you saying, man? Is your work more important than
the work of the shop? You have to go tomorrow. Fine, I will see. You wont see, you have to go tomorrow. Sure. What is wrong with this new generation? For them going around aimlessly
is more important. He has to go with Umair. I think my phone ran out of battery. Did you give flowers to Ramsha? Hmmm. What hmm, Afnan? I am asking you something. Yes, so I have responded to you.
Why are you asking me again and again? Why are you talking like this? Because I can ask you. I don’t understand
why you are talking like this. Think yourself, she took so much care of dad
in his illness. She didn’t move from next to him
even for a minute. His medication, his food, she cared for everything. I felt I should thank her. I couldn’t understand anything else,
so I gave her flowers. Oh, so this is why you gave her flowers. Yes, I gave it as a thank you,
there is nothing else in it. You never gave me flowers. How many gifts have you given to me
after marriage, Afnan? Okay fine, you too want flowers,
I will get them for you. Happy now? No, one minute Afnan. I don’t get it. Earlier you couldn’t tolerate that girl, you didn’t want to see her face. Now suddenly you sympathize
with her so much that you are getting her flowers. Look Alizay, I don’t understand
what your problem is actually. Do you have a problem that
I gave her flowers or do you have a problem that
I said thank you to her. I disliked both things, Afnan. Even ,if that girl served
she didn’t do a favor to us. Uncle has done a favor on him. He has kept her in this home,
he gives her food, he takes care of all her expenses,
he takes care of her educational expense. Don’t you see all this? She should thank us,
why are you thanking her? We are giving her all the luxuries
in this home, even if she did a little work, this doesn’t mean we go sit in her feet. Now you are saying something
wrong, Alizay? I am not saying the wrong thing, Afnan,
you people are doing wrong. That girl is not even worthy of sitting
in our feet, and you are getting her to your heads. Drag her out of this home
as soon as possible. Right now, I have to do something important,
so I am going from here. Afnan, this is not right. This is not right either. Afnan, I am talking to you. You sit, I will call him. Greetings. Greetings.
Sit. Sit, son. All okay?
Thank God. Papa was saying that you were not well. How are you fine? No, thank God, I am better now. Tell me, is your father fine? Papa is fine. Mr. Sajid, is his widow fine?
He has a daughter, right? Is she fine? Yes. He was a good man,
a really good man. It is God’s will,
everyone has to go one day. Right now, I am talking to you,
and I see his face. Yes, that’s how it is.
Whatever God wills. Okay yes, son did you not have to come
in the evening to get the cheque? Yes, I had to come in the evening, but I had some work in the evening,
so I came right now. Actually, your cheque is with my son,
Afnan and he has gone out somewhere,
I think to a meeting. I will do one thing, I will call him.
I will find out from him. he is not answering his phone, so we will wait for some time. Yes, fine. Do you want to have some cold drink? No. No. No. Okay, Mr. Qasim,
I was thinking I will come tomorrow or day
after to get the cheque. Yes, whatever is easy,
whatever you see fit. I will come tomorrow or day after. So, have some cold drink or tea?
No, I will just go. Thank you. Live long. Thank you. Apologies you were bothered. Brother, so much happened and I don’t know. You have stayed so unwell, you were admitted in the hospital
and I don’t even know about this. Let Alizay come,
I will just ask her. You were so unwell and
she didn’t even tell me. Hey, don’t say anything to Alizay,
I told her not to. No brother, you didn’t do right. You should have at least called me once, I would have come running. that’s why I didn’t call you. I know you well. You would have left everything
and come. You went to a function of your in-laws
after so long, so I thought you attend it comfortably. See, I am fine, thank God. Am I not fine or not? Speak up. Thank God brother,
that you are fine. I will do charity for you. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Your soup is ready, uncle.
Should I bring it? Child, you just came from the academy and you are worried for my soup
as soon as you came. You should have rested for some time. Uncle I don’t feel tired at all
going to the academy. You know, uncle,
I have noticed something. When I used to go to university, and come back,
I used to feel really tired. But since I have started going to
the academy and when I come back home, I feel really fresh. Thank God. Child, if you study religion, then this is its blessing and this is also
the blessing of our religion. You are absolutely right. You know, Afsheen, this child really cared for me. My medication, my food, I feel if God had blessed me with a daughter, then my daughter would have been
like that. Uncle, I will bring soup for you. Oh God, you are so stubborn. If someone talks to me like this,
I wont even see their face. Man, you need to be a little stubborn
for a healthy lifestyle. A person stays happy and healthy
because of it. Pass the cookies. Golden words by Mr. Fahad. I will write this down and get it framed. Okay, tell me, how is everything
in the office? It is going really good. In fact, we had a lot of business
this month. Good. I wanted to ask you something. Nowadays, Afnan seems a little off to me.
Why? Excuse me. I had to go to the academy.
I just checked, no driver is there. Will you please call so that
the driver can come? Ramsha, is there a time for you
to go to the academy or do you go to the academy
at any time? The servants of the home,
are the servants of this home, they are not your personal assistants. Actually, today is a special lecture, that is why I am going to the academy
at this time or else… Anyway, there is no driver. If you want go, you can go in a rickshaw and if you don’t have money for the fare,
then I will give it. Fine, I will…
You know, I was leaving as well. Come I will drop you. No, thank you. What happened? Why are you responding so badly? Your academy is near his home,
he will drop you. Right, Fahad? No, I will go myself. Ramsha, go with him. He is right. When uncle finds out later, another
drama will be created at home. You drop her. I will go.
Yes, yes, no issues. You go with him.
Come on. Okay Fahad, take care of yourself. Okay bye. Alizay, that…
Go. I didn’t like the way Alizay behaved
with you today. I had thought Afnan would have
given you respect at his home. But you are being humiliated
on small things. So sad. By the way, I have a solution
for this problem of yours. If you want, you can come live at my home. You keep this offer limited to yourself. Drive fast, I am getting late. Your refusal is attracting me
towards you. I had never given anyone else
the offer to come to my home. You know, no one else will be at home, it will just be me and you. Stop. Stop the car. I said stop the car! I said stop the car!
You won’t stop it? Stop it. Okay. Okay. One second.
One second. I am stopping it. Stop the car.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Ill-mannered, illiterate man. Where are you going? Wait. What is wrong with you? Why are you acting so decent?
I know well… Afnan. What was going on? Alizay had asked me to drop Ramsha
to the academy. I don’t know what happened to my car.
It is breaking down again and again. It is good that you came. Why don’t you drop her? I will take the car to the mechanic, okay? Fine, then we will meet. What was going on Ramsha? Ramsha, I am asking you
what was happening here? Afnan, he was saying
something wrong to me.
