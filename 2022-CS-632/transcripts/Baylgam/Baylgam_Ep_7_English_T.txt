[16.44] Ramsha, the thing is that
[19.48] you have gotten a proposal.
[22.96] Dad, I am sick of this aunt matchmaking.
[26.92] That aunt matchmaking hasn’t brought
 this proposal,
[30.36] in fact, your aunt has sent it.
[34.84] Aunt?
[36.96] Mom, tell you aunt that if she is really
 interested in matchmaking
[39.48] then she must go get Annie married, 
why is everyone after me?
[42.20] What nonsense Ramsha?
[45.12] At least ask whose proposal has 
she brought.
[49.36] Yes,
[51.16] actually your aunt has asked for 
your proposal for Shani.
[56.64] What?
[59.48] Shani and I?
[62.68] What is wrong with you guys?
[65.64] Yes, my child,
[67.12] he is a nice guy, plus he is family…
[69.60] What are you saying dad?
[71.80] How can I marry Shani?
[73.76] I have never thought like this about him.
[77.48] If you haven’t then do it now,
[80.00] he is family he has grown up
 in front of us.
[83.80] Listen?
[84.88] Think thoroughly and answer us.
[88.64] Yes, yes,
[90.28] think properly okay and then respond,
[95.16] it’s okay.
[103.12] Kids these days have a lot of attitude.
[115.52] That’s it, that’s it.
[117.32] Shall I give you something else? 
No I will just take salad, nothing else.
[122.36] Uncle, your appetite is decreasing 
day by day,
[126.52] you will get weak like this.
[128.44] My child, for now, 
my gut has become weak,
[131.52] there is an age factor too,
[133.68] if I eat more it gets difficult to digest.
[138.16] Brother, by the way, Alizey is right,
[140.48] if you will eat less you will become weak.
[144.64] Afsheen, my friend, Mr Jamil Malik,
[146.88] may God forgive him, he used to say
[149.16] that after 50 and 60,
[151.76] a man doesn’t eat food,
 food eats the man.
[155.12] So people get ill by eating more, 
no one gets ill by eating less.
[159.48] uncle is right.
[163.24] Alizey, please pass me the chicken.
[171.40] Alizey?
[172.72] Please pass me the chicken.
[175.20] Mom please pass the chicken to Afnan.
[183.92] Thank you aunt, so kind of you.
[191.56] Afsheen then did you talk to children?
[198.84] It’s good that you spoke about it, brother,
[201.36] both of them are home 
so let’s talk right now,
[203.24] you know sometimes Afnan is not home 
and others she is not home.
[209.20] Hmm, let’s ask then.
[210.96] What dates should we decide then, 
my child, Alizey?
[214.28] umm, uncle I don’t know
[217.56] and I don’t want to get married right now.
[219.92] Hey, what is wrong? 
But I want to get married,
[222.12] I don’t want to stay a bachelor. 
Let’s do one thing,
[225.40] let’s keep it on some weekend of the same month,
what say Alizey?
[228.32] Okay then marry whoever you want to 
but I don’t want to.
[233.48] Alizey? 
Alizey?
[235.56] Alizey, listen to me.
[237.88] What happened to Alizey?
[240.40] Nothing dad, you know she is a bit…
[243.04] She is just in a bad mood,
 I will fix it right now,
[245.40] just wait I am bringing him 
in two minutes.
[250.12] What is going on? What is wrong 
with both of them?
[253.32] I don’t know brother I think they had a fight 
over something again.
[258.00] I don’t know.
[259.64] It’s okay she will be fine. 
She is our daughter.
[270.08] Look at this dad,
[271.48] this is the final draft of the project 
I want to start.
[274.32] Have a look and ell what do you want 
to say about it?
[277.92] Yes, it’s fine,
[280.48] you must start it.
[282.32] Dad, I have done a profit and 
loss analysis for it
[286.32] and according to that we will at least 
get 30% profit by it.
[289.76] Hmm.
[291.36] It’s a huge project, I think 
you would need extra labor.
[294.52] no dad,
[295.84] I don’t need extra labor,
[297.68] the man power we have is very efficient.
[300.24] What we have to do is that not much,
[302.92] we will just have to make them work 
2 to 3 hours overtime,
[305.56] our project will be done and 
at the end of the day
[308.20] they will be at benefit too, 
their salaries will be increased
[310.80] and our work will be done as well.
[312.32] Okay fine,
[313.48] you talk to them and announce bonus 
for the labor as well.
[316.76] Dad, we give them annual bonus already
[320.28] if we start giving them bonuses 
every other month
[324.00] the profit margin will decrease.
[329.12] You keep on asking for virtue and 
success from God
[332.36] and then you get scared of spending 
from the money that he gives you?
[335.64] Be scared of the day,
[337.16] be scared of the day when he stops 
his virtue on us.
[341.28] Afnan?
[342.40] Yes dad, as you wish.
[347.72] Uncle, have you sent the driver outside?
[350.00] Yes, my child, he has gone with Afsheen,
[353.56] she wanted to get some things, why? 
You want to go somewhere?
[356.40] Yes, I wanted to go to a friend’s place,
[358.44] it’s okay I will get it from outside.
[360.96] No, no, why?
[362.40] Afnan is here, he will drop you,
[364.32] go Afnan, drop Alizey.
[366.36] It’s okay uncle, I will manage on my own.
[389.20] I feel like choking you to death right now.
[392.76] What sort of a friend are you? 
Couldn’t you tell me?
[395.00] I was about to tell you
[396.44] but when do you listen to 
anyone except yourself?
[399.96] remember I was about to say it 
the other day…
[401.56] So you should have talked clearly,
[403.32] why were you walking around 
in circles and talking?
[405.48] You could have clearly said that 
I have gotten a proposal for your brother.
[408.60] I was about to say it when mom came.
[411.96] I am so mad at your mom right now.
[414.80] How can she even think like this?
[416.92] That I and Shani,
[419.20] it even feels weird hearing about us.
[421.36] Imagine, look at me and 
then look at Shani.
[424.48] Now don’t even say that
[425.76] my brother is not as bad as you are saying.
[431.88] You like someone else is a different story.
[434.76] You know that right?
[435.92] You know I like someone else
[438.24] so why didn’t you tell your mom?
[440.04] How can I tell this to mom?
[442.24] So then you could have told your brother,
[444.52] you could have told anyone.
[445.64] We will get in trouble if I told brother.
[447.80] I feel like choking your brother to death.
[450.32] God forbid, may God give a long life 
to my brother.
[453.32] So then ask him to do things 
that would keep him alive,
[456.04] if he will do all this,
[458.16] I will kill him, I am telling you.
[461.24] You are very dangerous.
[463.52] That is what I am trying to 
make you understand,
[465.60] so go and tell this to your brother
[467.84] that it will be better for him to stay 
as far away from me as possible.
[472.28] I don’t understand
[474.52] that mom dad uncle and aunt 
everyone knows my nature
[478.80] but still how did they think 
that I and Shani?
[482.32] No no no, this is not possible.
[483.96] I will have to talk to mom, 
I will have to talk to mom.
[486.84] Why are you standing here?
Go away. Get lost.
[489.52] What have I done? Okay.
[495.32] I will have to talk to mom,
[497.24] how is it possible? 
How can I marry Shani?
[503.36] Relax, Ramsha, relax,
[505.88] I have to do something.
[509.60] Alizey?
[511.84] Alizey, listen to me.
[514.44] Alizey, listen to me, what is wrong?
At least listen to me.
[516.88] What is your problem Afnan?
[518.44] I have asked you not to talk to me.
[520.48] Okay fine,
[521.72] just think that do you even know 
how you behaved in front of dad?
[525.84] I Know it very well how 
I behaved in front of him,
[529.92] okay
[531.20] then do one thing, think and
 then let me think to
[534.32] because if you do this 
I will marry someone else.
[538.32] So then go and marry someone else 
by all means.
[541.36] I don’t care.
[542.48] You do care. I know it very well,
[546.08] you are just angry that is why 
you are saying all this
[548.88] else you love me a lot.
[552.24] Oh you are mistaken,
[554.64] I hate you.
[556.88] But I love you
[559.24] and do you know that
[560.88] if I had said this to any other girl
[563.28] she would have become crazy, 
crazyyy, hmm.
[566.48] So then go and confess your love
 to someone else.
[569.76] Why are you wasting my time?
[571.44] Alizey? Alizey, talk to me.
[573.36] Oh God you get mad over every little thing,
[576.52] I know that you are actually not mad,
[588.48] you deformed my nose.
[596.56] Phone.
[608.80] Let me call Afnan.
[622.52] Hello?
[626.80] Hello?
[627.80] What happened? 
Who was it?
[631.08] That you will tell me whose call was it?
[634.68] Who was it?
[637.92] Yeah, probably Afnan’s sister 
picked up the call.
[645.00] Anyway, it’s fine I will try in a while.
[650.32] This…
[652.92] Look,
[654.12] the number is not even saved,
 how would I know whose call is it?
[657.64] Is it the same girl I saw with you?
[663.16] Who might get crazy our of happiness
 after hearing the confession of your love.
[669.80] What? What are you saying?
[672.16] How is it possible? 
It must be a wrong number.
[676.00] Why are you talking like that?
[677.92] I am telling the number is not saved 
but still.
[680.16] Pointless fights and quarrels.
[683.68] Mom?
[685.12] I am here. 
Mom listen to me.
[687.68] What happened?
[690.04] Aunt? 
Hmm?
[691.68] Uncle is calling you outside.
[695.16] Your uncle came so early?
[697.24] Yes.
[698.64] I didn’t realize.
[702.40] mom.
[703.36] Tell me what is it?
[704.76] Mom, eave this and listen to me. 
What happened?
[709.56] Umm, I don’t want to marry Shani.
[714.56] What do you mean by you 
don’t want to marry?
[716.44] What is wrong with Shani?
[717.72] What’s good in Shani?
[719.84] Have you ever looked at him carefully?
[721.52] He looks so strange and then
 he dresses up so weirdly
[724.68] and take the same face to the shop.
[727.04] He is such nice, pious and talented boy.
[730.72] Oh please mom,
[732.48] I said I don’t want to marry him 
so I just don’t want to
[735.60] and he doesn’t have anything anyway,
[737.96] he doesn’t have a house, a car 
or a business and he is not even educated.
[743.92] I know he is not educated,
[746.12] he was never interested in studying 
since childhood
[749.00] but look at him now,
[750.32] he takes care of the business better than
 your dad and uncle.
[755.48] Mom, I am telling you that 
I don’t want to marry him
[758.76] so I don’t want to,
[760.28] go and refuse aunt right now, 
go please.
[763.00] Ramsha, go away and let me work.
[765.32] Mom, please.
[767.28] I am asking you to leave 
and let me work.
[771.00] Okay,
[772.32] okay then let dad come today,
[774.24] I will talk to him myself,
[775.60] I will tell him that I don’t want 
to marry Shani.
[777.76] Ramsha?
[781.32] Ramsha? Where is uncle?
[783.48] How would I know where he is?
[785.48] Hey?
[787.96] What is wrong with her? 
Why is her mood so off?
[790.48] Salma just let her be? Check the curry.
[799.72] What happened?
[801.88] What is going on between you and Afnan?
[805.56] Nothing has happened mom.
[808.04] Alizey, I am not blind.
[811.12] Alizey, he is constantly after you 
trying to make it upto you,
[814.20] but why are you so mad that 
you are not ready to fix things?
[816.96] mom, you are so concerned about Afnan?
[819.12] Yes I am concerned and 
You should be too.
[822.64] Can’t you see how he is so careful
 about you?
[825.64] He takes care of you so much.
[827.56] Let it be mom, you don’t know Afnan.
[837.00] That is what I want to know what is it?
That I don’t know.
[841.68] What is the quarrel that is not ending,
 Alizey?
[858.24] My child, if you disliked something 
Afnan did so then forgive him.
[867.16] Good and bad things happen 
between everyone,
[870.68] and now you guys are about to get 
in to this new relationship.
[875.44] If you will fight like this with each other,
[878.64] how will things work?
[882.68] Mom,
[884.04] I have a bad headache
[886.20] I am going to my room to rest for a while.
[890.96] Think calmly about what I have said.
[912.56] After all why don’t you understand
[914.64] that we cannot refuse this proposal.
[916.92] This proposal hasn’t come from outside
 but within home,
[919.76] we would have refused long time back 
if it was from somewhere else
[923.44] but your uncle and aunt has given proposal
for you and if your dad refuses him then…
[927.24] Then?
[928.28] It wouldn’t be much of a deal then,
[930.56] the worst that can happen is that uncle 
and aunt will get upset
[933.04] and then the things will fix 
at home in few days.
[935.28] What do you want?
[936.56] You want me to sacrifice myself 
so they don’t get upset?
[939.24] After all what is your problem?
[941.52] See,
[942.88] you now think all the flaws in him are good 
traits and you like listening to it.
[947.40] Shut up Ramsha.
[949.24] Ramsha, my child, 
keep one thing in mind,
[953.68] look this is a proposal from our home, 
Shani is our own kid,
[956.88] I even like him
[959.68] and most of all you will stay 
in front of our eyes.
[964.60] Dad, its better for me to stay happy 
rather than stay in front of your eyes.
[972.64] And I can never be happy 
in life with this Shani.
[979.00] Did you see what she is saying?
[981.52] It is all because of our over 
pampering and love.
[984.52] We have spoiled her.
[986.52] I will tell you to go right now and accept 
Salma and Anwar’s proposal.
[989.92] You must just go. 
Mom,
[992.28] you are talking like my enemy.
[994.96] Ramsha, aren’t you ashamed of calling 
your mother your enemy?
[999.00] yes, so you are talking like enemies too.
[1001.84] Dad, I beg you,
[1004.28] I beg you to please refuse this proposal. 
Please dad, please.
[1008.60] My child, why are you doing this? 
What is wrong with you?
[1010.44] Dad, since childhood till now even every toy 
that I have gotten is by my own choice,
[1013.84] so then such huge decision of marriage,
[1016.12] I beg you please refuse this proposal,
[1019.64] you cannot do me so wrong. Please dad.
[1023.28] This girl is too much, oh God forgive me.
[1025.52] Okay fine, go and let me think 
what I have to do.
[1030.04] You will still think about this?
[1032.12] Okay then fine, even I am sitting here
[1034.24] and I won’t move till 
you refuse this proposal.
[1049.08] okay my child,
[1051.88] I am not marrying you to Shani.
[1060.88] Really?
[1063.80] Dad, you are so good. 
Thank you so much,
[1067.52] thank you dad. 
Thank you so much.
[1070.72] I am not one of those dads
[1074.00] who sacrifice their daughters 
to save their relationships.
[1078.56] Your happiness is more important to me
 than anything in this world.
[1108.08] Hello?
[1109.72] Yes Afnan I have been waiting for your call 
for so long, do you know?
[1112.60] How many times have I told you
[1114.48] not to keep on calling 
if I don’t receive once,
[1117.92] why don’t you understand this little thing?
[1120.84] And I have especially asked you 
not to call at this time,
[1123.80] I am at my home, I am with my family.
[1126.24] What is wrong with you Afnan?
[1127.72] I was just calling because I was worried,
[1130.52] I want to tell you something important.
[1132.16] You have never-ending worries.
[1134.68] Afnan?
[1137.40] Okay fine,
[1138.92] call me when you are free, 
I will wait,
[1141.00] I need to talk to you about 
something important.
[1142.56] Okay I will call myself and will even 
listen to your problem
[1146.36] but you will not call me again now.
[1149.12] Okay fine, bye.
[1153.00] He is always busy.
[1158.56] what problem have I taken on myself?
[1165.52] So?
[1166.92] Are you done with the calculation or
you are just inking the pages?
[1170.36] Dad, I have written down the amount 
for the supply that we got in the morning,
[1173.36] and have mentioned the cost 
of cold drink,
[1175.72] let me know if anything is left.
[1177.08] Look Shani, brother met the wholesaler
[1180.16] so ask him about all the calculations.
[1183.08] I will talk to uncle.
[1184.80] Okay.
[1187.48] Dad,
[1189.64] my fees need to be paid 
this week as well.
[1193.92] No problem,
[1195.48] you just tell me a day or two before,
[1198.28] I will pay my daughter’s fee.
[1200.96] Okay Thank you.
[1203.64] Tea. 
Yes.
[1205.32] Annie, go and look after the kitchen 
if you are done studying,
[1210.04] clean it, it is all messed up, 
I get tired of working all day.
[1214.28] Mom, that is why I am saying 
to get a daughter in law
[1216.96] so she helps you with work.
[1218.56] Ramsha doesn’t even touch 
any work right now
[1221.60] I don’t know if she will work 
after marriage or not.
[1225.92] Mom,
[1228.00] Ramsha does work.
[1230.68] You don’t need to defend her,
[1232.96] has anyone asked you anything? 
Sit quietly.
[1239.12] Did you get any response from aunt?
[1241.12] Yes, I was about to ask the same.
[1245.04] Did brother respond?
[1247.48] No, there is no response, in fact, 
they didn’t talk about it at all.
[1258.84] Okay,
[1261.88] so then what do you think?
[1265.84] Will brother agree?
[1267.52] My Shani is one in a million, 
he is a mannerful kid,
[1274.12] and he is so hardworking and talented,
[1276.24] he doesn’t even have the bad company
 of friends.
[1279.08] They won’t even get such a son-in-law
 if the try to find.
[1281.60] Mom,
[1284.04] brother and Ramsha’s couple 
isn’t a little mismatch?
[1292.56] Hey why?
[1295.04] I mean, they are both stubborn.
[1300.84] There is nothing like that
[1302.84] and girls fix themselves after marriage,
[1306.12] she is a very nice girl,
[1308.04] she is just spoiled by the love of parents, 
otherwise, she is absolutely fine.
[1313.96] But still, Ramsha will never…
[1318.56] Who has asked you to sit here and 
talk about this marriage?
[1320.32] Go and clean the kitchen, I have told you,
you don’t listen, come on, get up.
[1324.92] Okay.
[1334.76] Mom, talk to them again.
[1339.20] Yes, I want the same
[1341.76] that you must talk once more 
to sister in law.
[1347.80] I will talk.
[1379.96] What happened? 
You didn’t sleep yet?
[1383.24] nothing I wasn’t just sleepy.
[1388.60] I Know you are worried 
because of Ramsha.
[1395.36] I don’t understand how to refuse Anwar.
[1401.28] He is my brother,
[1403.68] he has asked Ramsha’s proposal 
with so much pride in me.
[1409.64] Would you agree if I say 
something to you?
[1414.64] Say it?
[1418.48] Don’t refuse Anwar, say yes to him.
[1422.56] What are you saying?
[1424.36] Despite knowing that Ramsha is not ready 
for this marriage?
[1427.68] I know it, I know it.
[1430.48] She is a kid, she is still very childish
[1433.88] and she doesn’t know 
what’s good and bad,
[1437.36] if you look at Annie you will realize 
how she is so mature in this age.
[1442.44] I think that if I had a son,
[1444.60] would have made Annie my daughter in law.
[1448.16] You are right,
[1450.96] Ramsha is immature
[1454.16] but I cannot take her life decision 
without her choice.
[1464.56] I cannot see tears in her eyes and 
you know that very well.
[1471.08] Sajid, I am her mother
[1473.56] and I know her very well,
[1475.68] you will see when she gets married,
[1477.64] she will forget everything, she will be happy.
[1483.92] And Salma was telling me that
[1486.52] Shani has shown interest in marrying 
Ramsha himself,
[1495.08] Ramsha is Shani’s choice.
[1501.56] Just let them get married once and 
everything will be fine
[1508.60] and you will get a son and son in law 
in the shape of your nephew.
[1515.96] And the fear we have after marrying 
our daughter away,
[1521.20] that fear will be gone too.
[1528.04] This house, this business everything
 will stay in home only.
[1532.04] Life will become easy.
[1541.20] Let’s see what we can do.
[1546.96] I didn’t realize and its Fajr time.
[1633.08] Alizey?
[1640.24] What happened my child 
you didn’t go to office today
[1643.24] are you feeling well?
[1649.88] Say something?
[1652.16] Look I am getting tensed like this,
[1654.88] what is it my love?
[1657.88] Yes mom I am fine.
[1661.52] I ask so much,
[1663.32] you don’t tell anything, Afnan doesn’t 
tell anything either.
[1667.52] What is it?
[1669.88] Did Afnan say something? 
Did you guys have a fight?
[1676.92] You just consider my tears 
to be pointless.
[1682.52] Okay fine, I understand
[1686.40] but now until when will you lock yourself 
in the room like this?
[1690.08] Get up change and come out of here.
[1694.52] Yes mom, you go, 
I am changing and coming,
[1698.16] get coffee made for me.
[1702.92] Okay I will get it made.
[1704.88] Hurry up, okay?
[1733.56] Why didn’t you have breakfast with everyone.
[1736.56] I didn’t feel like it.
[1738.92] Just get me tea, I want to have tea.
[1744.40] If you allow, may I talk to Salma?
[1749.68] No,
[1751.44] I will talk to Anwar myself at Shop.
[1755.68] okay as you wish,
[1760.56] but please think and talk.
[1766.88] Yes Mehnaz even I am scared
[1769.80] that there might be problem 
between me and Anwar.
[1776.40] This girl has put us through such a trial.
[1780.16] I am very angry at Ramsha.
[1782.68] There is no need to say anything 
to Ramsha.
[1785.40] And don’t get angry at her for no reason,
[1788.20] it is her right to marry or not marry anyone.
[1792.32] I don’t understand how will I talk to Slama
 how will I face her.
[1798.44] Don’t worry about Salma, 
I will talk to Anwar he will talk to her.
[1803.44] don’t worry and get me tea.
[1807.00] okay.
[1826.24] Greetings.
[1827.60] Greetings.
[1830.28] Where did you go brother?
[1833.84] no no everything is fine,
[1835.16] your sister in law stopped me to talk
 about something important.
[1839.28] Brother, even I wanted to talk to you 
about something important,
[1841.60] I don’t get a chance at home to talk to you.
[1845.96] Slama was asking what is your decision 
about Ramsha and Shani’s marriage?
[1856.20] What happened brother? 
Why are you quiet?
[1861.40] Where is Shani?
[1862.52] He has gone to the warehouse, 
for stock…
[1865.36] look Anwar,
[1866.92] you are my brother,
[1868.76] you are the closest to my heart
[1874.28] and Shani is not my nephew, 
I have always considered him like my son.
[1879.48] Brother,
[1881.40] no matter if you say something or not,
[1883.60] I know what is in your heart, I know,
[1888.08] I have given you the status of a father 
after dad left,
[1892.44] I have always asked for you
[1895.68] and now in this important decision of life,
[1898.72] I have asked for your help.
[1902.40] All that is absolutely fine,
[1905.64] Shani is a very nice boy too…
[1908.28] So that means you are agreeing to Shani 
and Ramsha’s marriage?

[1970.64] Greetings.
[1971.92] Greetings.
[1973.08] What happened? 
Why do you look so upset?
[1976.64] I am just coming back from Alizey’s room,
[1978.92] she hasn’t even gone to office today,
[1980.52] I don’t know why has she locked herself 
in the room.
[1982.60] I don’t understand what is wrong with her.
[1985.24] Okay don’t worry, I will talk to her.
[1987.64] I am going to make coffee for Alizey,
[1990.56] I came out because I saw you.
[1992.20] Shall I make it for you as well?
No. I will make it myself in fact,
[1995.60] I will make myself for Alizey too, 
my hard work might pay off.
[1998.72] You have just come back from work,
you are tired.
[2001.32] My beloved aunt, 
why do you worry?
[2004.48] I know it very well,
[2006.24] whenever Alizey gets upset with me,
[2008.24] she gets fixed in a snap when 
she drinks the coffee that I make.
[2012.24] Okay, come. 
Let’s go.
[2017.52] Sister in law?
[2019.12] Sister in law? 
Hey Salma?
[2021.32] Sister in law you are here? 
I looked for you in the entire house.
[2024.40] hey?
[2025.84] Have sweets, have sweets. 
Just have it.
[2029.72] I wanted to have this sweet 
by you though,
[2032.52] but I got so emotional out of happiness
 that I can’t even tell you.
[2037.84] Thank god, god gave us the opportunity 
to witness this happiness.
[2041.88] Wow,
[2044.00] you are all eating sweets alone 
and no one even asked me?
[2047.00] No, my child, here this is for you,
[2050.04] infact, keep the whole packet,
[2052.48] you have the most right on it.
[2054.80] Wow, it’s a very delicious sweet,
[2057.32] its very tasty. Greetings dad,
have sweets.
[2060.92] No I had it at the shop. 
Greetings brother.
[2063.32] Greetings.
[2064.36] Wow, so the sweets are being 
distributed at the shop as well?
[2067.20] but what for?
[2068.80] I also don’t understand that 
why is Salma feeding sweets?
[2075.44] Anyway, none of our business,
[2077.12] may God give them thousands of 
such happiness
[2079.72] so we get thousands of sweets like these.
[2081.24] Amen,
[2082.96] is everything okay you look so worried, 
what happened?
[2086.64] you didn’t understand it even after 
having sweets?
[2089.48] What?
[2091.16] What did I not understand?
[2093.00] I said something to Anwar and 
he took it wrong.
[2125.76] if he wasn’t able to understand 
then you should have told them
[2129.52] that Ramsha is not ready for this marriage.
[2133.32] Why did you stay quiet? 
You should have said.
[2136.20] He is my brother
[2138.72] I couldn’t have clearly refused.
[2144.92] I was talking indirectly and 
he took it wrong.
[2148.72] You have no idea what you have done.
[2153.32] Don’t worry let me do something.
[2174.28] Alizey?
[2177.60] I have made piping hot coffee.
[2181.32] I swear you will enjoy 
after having this coffee.
[2183.96] I don’t want to have coffee. Please leave.
[2187.04] What is wrong with you, Alizey?
[2189.44] Why are you talking so rudely to me.
[2191.80] I have made coffee with so much love
 for you and you know it very well
[2196.76] that I cannot tolerate your rudeness 
and when you are upset,
[2200.72] it ruins my day and night, 
I am unable to work,
[2204.04] that is why I came early from work
so I can talk to you.
[2206.40] So what?
[2208.28] You haven’t done any favor on me
by coming early from office,
[2211.52] I didn’t ask you to come early from work.
[2218.44] Alizey, what is wrong with you?
[2220.64] You are that upset? Look at me.
[2225.60] Why are you making a big deal 
out of such a small issue?
[2230.80] Listen, I cannot tolerate this behavior 
from you.
[2235.92] I have been restless all night, 
I couldn’t even sleep because of you.
[2239.92] You must not be able to sleep 
because you were missing someone.
[2243.00] What?
[2246.56] I am so sorry not at you but myself,
[2250.96] in fact I feel sorry on my love for you 
that I cannot prove you
[2254.24] how sincere I am with you,
[2256.20] I cannot affect you that my love for you… 
Afnan, who was that girl?
