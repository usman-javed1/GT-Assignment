What will be my work? I mean, what will be my job? What do I … Your job, hmm.. When I come to the office, you will have to ask
me for tea or water, you will have to take care of me, you will have to chit chat with me and rest you are smart
enough to know. You ill-mannered. Noble girls have stopped
going out of home because of people like you, despite needing a job, those girls cannot leave their homes because scoundrels
like you don’t let them work. Hey, go away, I know girls like you very well. Really? What do you know? Tell me, what do you know about us? All the time that you
invested in knowing us, if you had put that time into
knowing your character, you would have known
what a disgusting man you are, how scary you are! Have you ever seen
yourself in the mirror? You look like a well dressed animal. Shut the hell up else
I will get you thrown out of here. Get me thrown out, get me out right now, Hello, excuse me? call everyone,
so everyone should know what you actually are, Call everyone. Mr Liaquat what has happened? Whatever happened was wrong that shouldn’t have happened but I will get this matter investigated, though you shouldn’t have created
a scene like this in our office. I shouldn’t have created a scene? It was very important
to create this scene else you or the people
of your office would have never found
out the reality of this man. You never know how many
girls has he harassed, how many girls went
back crying from here, do you have any idea? Are you informed? Look, Mr Liaquat has been here
for the past 10 years and there has never been such
a complaint about him in all these years, I can’t believe on
whatever you are saying Wow, it has been 10 years? He must have taken advantage of
God knows how many helpless girls. Mr Afnan, 10 years is a lot, if I hadn’t spoken up today, you wouldn’t even know
for the next 10 years because you just care about
a girl’s qualifications, not their character. For your kind information, we do business here, this is not a marriage bureau where we must find matches for people and collect their personal history, we just care about people’s
qualifications here. So then okay, you don’t need to hire
female staff at all, when you cannot provide them
with a secure environment so then hire male staff, not ladies, do you understand? Miss Ramsha, I guess you are forgetting that this is my office, whatever I command
will happen here, and that is why keep your
suggestions to yourself. I know, you make decisions without knowing
what is right or wrong because you just think about yourself, that is why today you are definitely
a successful businessman but you are not a good person. Wow, it has been 10 years? He must have taken advantage of
God knows how many helpless girls. because you just care about
a girl’s qualifications, not their character. you make decisions without
knowing what is right or wrong because you just
think about yourself, that is why today you are definitely
a successful businessman but you are not a good person. Umm, Miss Ramsha
just came right now, yes, yes, yes, bring her CV to me please. Thank you. What is wrong with you? Why were you saying
that you will marry me? How did even this come
to your brain? Tell me? what is wrong with you, Afnan? You love me, if you won’t marry me, then who else will you marry? What is wrong with you? I just talk to you nicely
a couple of times, does that mean
I will marry you? I thought that she is
probably a naïve girl who might need my guidance and if I can make her a good friend and guide her, save her
from bad people, so this was not love, that doesn’t mean,
I want to marry you. Do you actually not love me? yes, I truly, falsely, in any world, I do not love you, Ramsha, but why don’t you
understand this Ramsha? I don’t understand myself, a girl who he used to dislike
so much until yesterday, how does he have so much
love and sympathy for her today that he decided to
make her his daughter in law and has also asked
talk to sister in law about it. Whatever it is, mom,
I am not going to marry her. So why are you telling me? Go talk to your dad, this is not my decision,
this is your dad’s decision. Mom, you know it very
well I cannot say no to him, whatever it is, you go talk to him, tell him he doesn’t like her. Shani, all of you have decided to annoy me, I will not talk to him about anything, go and talk to him yourself
about anything you want to say. I don’t understand dad, what has gotten into him all of a sudden? I should marry the girl no one
is even asking? Wow. Oh! That’s how bad Ramsha is? You are not so pure either, don’t forget what you do yourself. I remember it very well, there is no need to talk about the
same thing again and again, I just won’t marry her,
understand this. Oh God! I am being a sandwich
between both son and father. For your kind information, we do business here, this is not a marriage bureau where we must find
matches for people and collect their personal history, we just care about people’s
qualifications here. So then okay, you don’t need to hire
female staff at all, when you cannot provide them
with a secure environment so then hire male staff, not ladies, do you understand? Miss Ramsha, I guess you are forgetting that this is my office, whatever I command will happen here, and that is why keep your
suggestions to yourself. How was your interview? You can’t get the job so easily. Hmm, true that, why don’t you apply for
teaching in some school? Didn’t you have a worse
suggestion to give than this? They make us work so hard and didn’t even pay us the fee of
two students in the name of salary. They would keep the whole
fees of every child themselves but they die when it’s about
giving salaries to the teachers. They make us work so hard
in the name of artwork, I don’t want to do this job, especially teaching. You are absolutely right. Do you know, dad was very angry
about you doing a job. What else does your father know, he just gets angry. Aren’t you scared of Dad? When a person gets alone, they either become a
coward or very brave. What are you out of them? What do you think? I feel you are very brave and smart. Didn’t you tell sister in law that girls don’t do a job in our family? Anwar, when sister in
law allowed Ramsha then who am I or you to stop her? And like she will stop if we tell her to? Okay, hmm, then do one thing, talk to sister in law about Ramsha
and Shani’s marriage then where and how to stop her, that will be my duty. Anwar, first convince your son for it, he won’t marry Ramsha at all,
he doesn’t like her. What difference does that make? When I have decided that Shani will marry Ramsha, then he will marry her, the decision has been made. Anwar, you must still rethink once because Ramsha and Shani have
completely different mentalities, Shani doesn’t like Ramsha. What is wrong with you Salma? Have you forgotten me? Don’t you know me? If I have made a decision, I must have thought it through, do you understand? What do you mean? If that girl wouldn’t have made noise, then we would have never found out. Hmm, so what will you suggest? Sir, I think we should file a case. Hmm. We should definitely file
a case against him, it is very important to punish such
people for their wrongdoings but the problem is that even if we file a case against him, any girl that would have
been harassed by him will never come forward in the court, this is the problem of our society, where the girls get harassed their families never let them come in front of the world. I wish I wish that families get the courage and help us in getting such people punished. You are right sir. Hmm, anyway, we will talk on this matter again, we will call a meeting, but for now, go and meet Mr Faheem, he has been waiting for you
for quite some time now. Yes, sir. Dial the lawyer’s number. Come, Salma. I swear I was just thinking
to go make tea and you brought the tea. See, the hearts are
connected with each other, you just thought of it
and I brought tea. Ramsha will be here anytime, my daughter has been going
around giving interviews to get a job but it has been so many days
and there is no luck. Sister in law, you should get Ramsha married, everything will get solved on its own, her husband will take
all the responsibility. Salma, there is no mother
who wouldn’t want her daughter to get married, even I want it but what can I do, the situation
is not the same now, I cannot even get her
married if I want to. Sister in law, it just takes a yes from you and Ramsha can get married today. What did you say? Hey is there any proposal for her? Salma, quickly tell me? Who is the family? Where do they live? Tell me. Sister in law, the match is in the house why would anyone come
from the outside? What do you mean?
I don’t understand. Sister in law, Anwar wants Shani
and Ramsha to get married. Sister in law, I am telling you the truth, he wants them kids to get married and he was saying that if I won’t be concerned for
my widow sister in law or my niece so who else will? And how will I face my
late brother in the future? Okay, have tea. yes... Brother, are you busy? No, no, where would I be busy? You tell me, is everything okay?
Come sit. Brother, I wanted to talk to you but then I thought that you are busy so I didn’t. You are embarrassing me, listen even if I am busy you can say what you want to. Look, the love of sisters
and their rights are very much on their brothers. Thank you, brother, I just wanted to talk about
Alizey and Afnan’s marriage. Let’s get them married now. In the name of Allah! Do however you think is better. You have to do the preparations from
both the girl's and boy’s side, so do whatever you feel is right. Okay brother, I just wanted that we invite a few close people from
the family and a few elders, and let’s fix the wedding date so that the family knows too and there will be some sort of
celebration at home too. Afsheen, do whatever
you think is right, you are the mother of the girl and aunt of the groom, can anyone stop you? Just do however you like and then we will make
arrangements accordingly, okay? Okay brother. And don’t get formal, okay? okay. Thank God. Who is it? Greetings. Greetings. How are you? Absolutely fine. How are you? I am fine. You look very tired today. I gave interview at 3 places, just pray I get a call
from somewhere. Let’s see what happens. If God wills. Don’t worry Ramsha, you will get a job and you will get it very soon, okay? Shall I get water for you? Yes, listen to me, bring food along with water too, I have just had a cup of
tea since morning, I am very hungry. okay do one thing,
I will get you water, and I will put the food for
you on dining table, okay? Unknown number? Hello? Greetings, who is it? Greetings, I don’t thing that I need
to tell you my name. I didn’t recognize? Who is it? You do recognize me, Afnan speaking. Yes, tell me, why have you called me? I saw your CV, you qualify for this job, you can join from tomorrow morning. I will ask the relevant people to give you an appointment letter and teach you the work too Thank you so much but
I don’t want your charity. I am not giving you charity, I am giving you a job. Thank you so much, but I don’t need anything given by you. Don’t talk rubbish, I know very well that you need this job. I needed you as well, anyway, stop feeling pity on me, Mr Afnan. Ramsha, I am not feeling pity on you, nor am I sympathizing with you. You are qualified for the
job you applied for. I said, I don’t need anything from you, don’t ever call me again. Ramsha, water. Thank you, Annie. Umm, do you know, yours and brother’s marriage
is being discussed. Salma has just spoken to me about it, I haven’t given her any
response yet so don’t worry. So mom, why are you thinking
so much to respond? You should have refused. Mom? I am talking to you and you are fixing the
bedsheet here? You already refused aunt once so then what is the problem now? Ramsha, things were different back then, the situation is not the same anymore, try to understand, the situation has changed now. So did you forget what
Shani did to me? Don’t you remember anything? I didn’t forget anything, I remember everything, you leaving this house, your marriage being called off and then your dad passing away
due to this news, and then whatever Shani did taking
advantage of all these matters, I remember everything, I haven’t forgotten anything,
I haven’t forgotten anything. Mom, I am so sorry, forgive me, I didn't mean to hurt you, I didn’t want to hurt you, I was just reminding you mom. My child, the situation is not like before, your dad was alive earlier, but now, I cannot take any decision alone. I feel like, I feel like we are standing in the
streets with dead end, and even if I close the windows
and doors by the fear of storm, we will still die of suffocation,
my child. Try to understand, I have become weak, my child, I have become a widow, I cannot carry any burden of your
wrong decision, my child, I cannot now. Listen to me? Stop crying, sit here, sit here, mom, look, listen to me, whatever you want… mom? Whatever you will say, it will happen. Stay blessed, stay happy my child. stay happy Please stop crying. Listen? Hmm? Shani wants to talk to
you about something. Yes? Say it? Umm, do we have to go to the shop early today? Today? My child, we have to go early everyday. If you will go early, I would be grateful to you, that would be very nice, I have given the keys to Arshad, he will open the shop, you just get there in time. Okay. Did sister in law dive any response? Umm, she was saying that 
she will think and reply. Now tell me, what is there to think about? Like her daughter has a queue 
of good proposals here, she will think and reply. No whatever it is, Anwar, I cannot impose 
my choice on her that answer me now. Okay, let her think, I will also see how much she can think. I am going to brother Safdar’s place, do get to the shop in time. Okay. Do you understand? Don’t be late. What is this way? You were supposed to talk to dad that I won’t marry her. Shani, your dad was sitting here, you should have
 spoken to him yourself. Mom, if I had to talk myself,
 why would I even ask you? Shani, keep me away
 from this matter, whatever you want to say, 
say it yourself to your father, don’t eat my head. Mom, you know that dad 
won’t listen to me, why do you want to make a joke 
out of me in front of everyone? My friends will make fun of me, they will say that your family made
 you a sacrificial animal and if she is not getting proposals because of what she does, that doesn’t mean 
I should marry her. So I didn’t make this match, your dad did, go talk to him. Okay I admit but you end this at least? No I cannot d anything, my hands have always been 
tied in front of your father. Brother, your tea. To hell with the tea. Mom, your tea. Drop it on my head, you are here to eat my brain, their brain doesn’t work at all, what sort of environment is
 going on at home, but tea. Have tea, there is no other work. What the hell? Were there any less problems that now this Shani’s problems are being imposed on me, as well? I am not even getting a job, how will I convince mom 
if I don’t get a job? Oh God! Get me a good job, please solve my problems. Oh yes, why didn’t I think of it earlier? I should call sister Shiza, I can get any work in her channel, sister Shiza gave me so much
 love at the morning show, gave me so much protocol, if I talk to her she will definitely do
 something for me. Let me call her. Hello? Greetings. Greetings, who is this? Komal? You are Komal, right? Ramsha speaking. Ramsha who? I guess you forgot, I am the same Ramsha who came to your morning
 show with her mother and my video went viral by
 the name of shopping girl? Oh Ramsha, yes, yes, yes, I remember now, 
so tell me how are you? Can I speak to sister Shiza? Regarding what? Actually I needed a job so I thought of talking to sister Shiza, I wanted to work in your
 team with you people. Oh so that is what you wanted? Yes. Look Ramsha, as soon 
as Miss Shiza gets free I will tell her about your call
 and your concern, okay? Okay, once she gets free do make me… Hello? Hello? Komal? What a fool. you qualify for this job, you can join from tomorrow morning. Thank you so much but I don’t want your charity. Don’t talk rubbish, I know very well that you need this job. I needed you as well, anyway, stop feeling pity on me, Mr Afnan.
