[21.28] Alizay, please go and
have your medicine.
[23.88] Mama, I don’t want to eat
the medicine.
[26.80] Can I say something?
[28.12] Not just me, but even Afnan is getting
tired of this stubbornness of yours.
[44.16] You should thank God
[46.76] that God gave you such
a loving husband.
[50.16] Yes, I have such a loving husband
[52.84] that you called him two hours back.
[59.68] He didn’t even bother to come
and ask me.
[65.80] Okay are you not my love,
[67.20] go and have your medicine.
[75.76] Alizay, now you have to take care
of your future child along with yourself.
[90.36] Did you not hear
what the doctor said?
[92.68] He said you really need
to care for your health.
[97.56] Mama, you and Afnan,
[99.28] both of you only blackmail me
emotionally.
[103.92] What have I done?
[108.52] Hello.
[112.80] What?
[119.04] What happened, Alizay?
[132.04] Mama, that…
[134.44] What is the matter? Speak up.
[136.48] Mama, Afnan. Afnan.
[138.76] What happened to Afnan?
[210.40] You didn’t even call me once, Afnan,
[213.76] you are doing me very good.
[217.32] I married you and kept you here.
[224.36] I have deprived you of all your rights,
[233.76] I even feel embarrassed looking you
in the eyes.
[247.00] And how can I live with Alizay?
[251.76] I have no respect or place in her eyes
[257.48] and if I tell you the truth,
[260.28] she wants to live with me out of
stubbornness and not out of her love.
[287.80] Who is there?
[301.40] Greetings brother Jamshed.
[303.08] You are here at this hour? All okay?
[305.32] Madam Ramsha, Afnan…
[309.72] Mr. Afnan had an accident.
[314.32] What? How?
[317.20] I just got a call from home,
his car had an accident.
[320.52] Yes, but where is Afnan?
What happened to him? Is he fine?
[324.84] I don’t know that.
[330.88] But I have heard they took him
to the hospital.
[334.76] Okay I am bringing my shawl,
[336.32] you please take me to the hospital 
right now.
[337.84] But Madam Ramsha…
[338.68] There is no time for ifs and buts, 
brother Jamshed,
[340.20] he is in the hospital, 
I am just bringing my shawl.
[342.04] Just wait I am coming.
[349.20] Alizeh, my child, stay strong,
[351.24] Afnan will get well, by God’s will.
[354.32] How did all this happen, mom?
[357.04] Alizeh, I used to tell you 
not to fight with Afnan.
[362.44] The impact of all these fights 
is very negative, my love.
[369.28] Don’t worry, he will get back to his 
consciousness, if God wills.
[377.52] Greetings, what happened to Afnan? 
Where is he? Is he okay?
[381.48] Will you tell me about Afnan’s health, 
please?
[384.44] Ramsha, what are you doing here?
[392.00] Who told you we are here?
[396.20] Umm,
[397.88] I found out that Afnan met 
an accident.
[401.68] Even if you found out, 
you didn’t have to come here.
[412.76] Why are you standing here now? 
Go away.
[414.68] I just want to meet Afnan for once,
I will see him and…
[418.12] Ramsha please, we are already 
very tensed here,
[420.64] don’t create more mess here please, 
go away, please.
[422.96] Alizeh, I… 
Ramsha, this is a hospital,
[425.80] do us a favor, and don’t put up
 a show here.
[427.92] Now go away.
[475.16] Madam Ramsha,
[478.88] stay strong, don’t worry,
[481.88] If God wills, nothing will happen 
to Mr. Afnan, he will get well.
[488.00] Brother Jamshed, Doctor was saying,
Afnan is not well.
[492.04] Anything can happen.
[493.76] So much pain.
[495.72] And I am so helpless,
[497.60] I cannot even take care of Afnan 
or see him, or even go near him.
[502.52] Have faith in God, He is the one 
who makes ways,
[505.20] have patience.
[506.60] Brother Jamshed, I am constantly
 trying to tell my heart
[511.76] but my heart is not convinced,
[515.56] please take me to the hospital 
again to see Afnan.
[518.80] I will go to Afnan take care of him,
[521.20] will stay close to him.
[522.44] I will get into Alizeh’s feet 
and beg her for Afnan.
[525.96] You know Madam Alizeh’s anger.
[537.32] She will never let you meet Mr. Afnan,
[540.24] she will insult you instead.
[552.56] But don’t worry,
[554.96] I will keep on updating you about 
Sir Afnan’s condition.
[560.24] Thank you, brother Jamshed.
[598.12] Is it that you don’t believe in my love?
[603.32] Ramsha, I love you a lot,
[612.84] trust me.
[617.04] I trust in your love that is why 
I married you.
[623.20] I wish,
[626.12] I wish, I would have believed 
in your love for me earlier,
[637.92] so I didn’t have to see all this today.
[645.20] I have hurt you
[648.88] but I am sorry, that is why 
I am here to apologize.
[653.88] What happened?
[654.96] Why are you looking at me like this?
[658.60] I am just looking
[660.80] that you shower so much love 
on me in a moment
[664.48] and then in the next moment, 
what happens to you?
[666.32] I am unable to understand.
[670.28] I am unable to understand 
that as well
[675.72] but I guess that is my way of loving.
[685.56] Forgive me, please.
[696.00] Ramsha?
[698.12] Ramsha, please listen to me, 
Ramsha?
[700.40] Ramsha,
[702.72] open the door, please.
[706.28] Ramsha, I know this is wrong with you
but what should I do? I am helpless.
[712.36] Ramsha?
[721.68] Okay,
[723.36] don’t open the door,
[725.72] I am a fool to be making 
so much effort.
[728.36] I am leaving. Bye.
[759.56] Alizeh, you are tired, my love, 
you must go home and rest.
[766.16] You are right, Mom,
[768.40] I am actually tired,
[775.20] I am unable to sit for any longer.
[778.00] I know, you need rest.
[781.28] I will stay here with Afnan.
[784.56] Mom, Afnan will get well, right?
[787.48] He will be absolutely well, my love.
[789.48] You will see he will get back to 
his consciousness very soon.
[793.08] What if he doesn’t get 
his consciousness back?
[795.08] Hey?
[796.60] You must not think like this,
[798.24] always expect good from God.
[801.00] Don’t worry, my love.
[805.84] If God wills.
[807.92] Will you be able to manage alone?
[810.92] Don’t worry and go home,
[813.64] rest at home.
[814.92] I will call you in case of anything.
[817.44] Thank you, Mom.
[841.84] My God,
[845.16] your sinner woman, I am sitting here 
in front of you,
[849.56] you always had mercy on me,
[853.24] you even granted me 
what I didn’t ask for,
[858.84] you have granted me 
your special blessings,
[862.00] but today, this sinner woman of yours,
[864.76] is sitting here begging in front of you,
[869.12] My God, give speedy recovery 
to Afnan soon,
[873.96] My Lord, grant good health to Afnan,
[877.92] Oh God, never take away 
my husband from me.
[884.56] My Lord, you know I have no one 
except Afnan in this world.
[891.64] My Lord,
[893.48] you have control of everything,
[896.64] you say be and it becomes,
[900.48] answer my prayers and 
make Afnan well,
[905.72] make Afnan well.
[995.96] I am asking you to take care of yourself 
and you are telling me I am getting angry at you?
[1000.64] I mean you never used to take 
so much care of me,
[1004.44] how are you feeling 
so much love for me?
[1007.64] Is it because we are about 
to have a baby
[1010.16] and that is why you are doing all this?
[1012.36] Whatever you are thinking is right.
[1015.12] Anyway, I like it,
[1018.60] the way you are taking care of me.
[1022.76] Look,
[1024.48] I will also like it if you quit 
going to the office.
[1030.68] Afnan, can we talk about this later?
[1039.40] Alizeh, please go and have medicine.
[1042.04] Mom, I don’t want to have medicine.
[1045.08] Shall I say something?
[1046.20] Because of your stubbornness, 
not just me,
[1049.00] Afnan is also getting very irritated.
[1062.64] You should be thankful to God
[1065.00] that he has given you such 
a loving husband.
[1068.44] Yes, my husband is so loving that 
you called him 2 hours ago,
[1073.28] he didn’t bother to come 
and ask me.
[1080.56] Afnan, why are you cutting the fruits,
[1082.92] I will go say it in the kitchen, 
they will cut it for me.
[1085.76] Hey, I know that the people 
in the kitchen can cut it for you
[1088.12] but you don’t eat it from them. 
Here, have it.
[1092.12] Afnan, I had tea just a while ago,
[1095.48] I am not in the mood to have fruits at all.
[1098.00] Alizeh, can you ever listen to me?
[1118.64] Ma’am, get this medicine from outside.
[1121.00] Okay I will. 
Okay.
[1167.12] Look Afnan, I am here to meet you.
[1170.40] Afnan, open your eyes,
[1173.48] look at me,
[1177.68] talk to me, Afnan.
[1180.20] Forgive me Afnan,
[1182.60] I should have not fought with you 
and sent you that day,
[1185.52] I shouldn’t have fought with you at all.
[1188.48] All this has happened because of me,
[1190.64] whatever is your condition right now, 
it is because of me.
[1196.28] Open your eyes once and forgive me, 
Afnan, please.
[1202.28] Please Afnan, open your eyes 
and talk to me.
[1207.48] I have come here after 
so much difficulty,
[1210.00] they are not even letting me meet you,
[1212.40] they are not even letting me see you.
[1280.80] How do you feel now, Afnan?
[1283.00] Way better than before.
[1292.52] My head hurts a lot,
[1295.64] but I don’t remember since how long
I have been here at the hospital.
[1300.60] Don’t think much,
[1307.96] The Doctor has said 
that you need rest,
[1310.12] if you will think, you are obviously 
going to get a headache.
[1319.16] You will see you are gradually 
going to get well,
[1322.84] you just need rest.
[1330.80] Thank God that you are 
out of danger now.
[1335.76] Alizeh,
[1337.32] doctors have allowed us 
to take Afnan home.
[1350.00] You go and ask them how the medicines 
are supposed to be given.
[1352.72] Okay, I will go ask, you sit.
[1357.92] How are you feeling now, Afnan?
[1359.32] I am better now.
[1361.24] Thank God, you get back 
your consciousness,
[1366.32] you have no idea 
how worried we were,
[1371.56] you come home well and 
I will give charity for you.
[1376.08] Okay.
[1430.28] You know it very well I will never cause 
you any pain on purpose
[1435.52] and I don’t want you to get into 
any trouble because of me.
[1444.72] I know.
[1449.52] You know it but you still hurt me.
[1453.56] I am sorry,
[1456.00] I got angry all of a sudden,
[1458.48] but you are right that it doesn’t me 
I should shout at you,
[1461.60] that is why, I am sorry.
[1464.72] It’s okay I forgive you.
[1467.72] Hey,
[1469.44] I am saying I realize my mistake,
[1472.40] I know you have been hurt 
because of me.
[1476.76] It is your job to hurt me,
[1479.64] it’s nothing new.
[1535.84] No problem. 
Ramsha?
[1538.76] Ramsha, please listen to me, 
Ramsha?
[1541.04] Ramsha,
[1543.48] open the door, please.
[1547.16] Ramsha, I know this is wrong with you
but what should I do? I am helpless.
[1553.40] Ramsha?
[1562.52] Okay,
[1564.32] don’t open the door,
[1566.52] I am a fool to be making 
so much effort.
[1569.04] I am leaving. 
Bye.
[1587.00] Greetings, brother Jamshed,
[1588.52] you here at this time? 
Is everything okay?
[1590.80] Madam Ramsha, that Afnan…
[1595.32] Sir Afnan had an accident.
[1599.88] What?
[1600.80] How?
[1602.68] I have just got a call from home, 
his car met an accident.
[1693.92] Madam Ramsha?
[1698.68] Madam Ramsha?
[1719.76] Hello? 
Hello, brother Jamshed,
[1723.04] Madam Ramsha is not home, 
has she gone somewhere?
[1725.64] I have been ringing her doorbell 
for so long she is not opening the door.
[1728.68] No, no, she is at home, 
you ring the doorbell again.
[1733.72] Okay I will ring the doorbell 
again and see,
[1735.76] I will also wait for a while, 
she might be in the washroom.
[1738.24] Okay fine, bye.
[1746.76] Madam Ramsha?
[1784.32] What happened? 
You are still standing here,
[1786.88] did Madam Ramsha not 
open the door yet?
[1788.88] No, she is not opening the door, 
I have been standing here for so long.
[1798.20] Brother Jamshed, I think 
there is something wrong.
[1804.12] Do one thing, call Sir Afnan.
[1807.32] Yes, right.
[1821.80] What happened? 
Is he not picking up?
[1824.56] He is not well.
[1826.28] Okay do one thing, a gatekeeper 
is sitting downstairs,
[1829.24] you call him he might be able 
to do something.
[1831.36] Okay, don’t worry, Sir Afnan has 
given me a duplicate key of this flat.
[1835.64] You are the limit, 
you thought of it so soon!
[1838.08] Quickly open the door.
[1849.80] Madam Ramsha? 
Madam Ramsha,
[1852.92] Madam Ramsha, get up.
