You should talk to Shani. How can he blame Ramsha? He is sitting in anger upstairs. Go, talk to him. 
What is this behavior? When it comes to them, 
my mind has stopped working. They do not have anything else 
to do than just fight. They fight 24/7. We also used to fight, but no, it is nothing in front of them. Where is the princess? 
Has she not come back yet? How would I know? 
I have tried calling multiple times, but she is not answering. No one 
is answering at Mr. Qasim’s home. I don’t know what is happening. Please go, and talk to Shani once. Please go. Look, don’t panic. Nothing is going to happen to you. I will handle everything. I really wish you had told me
 all this earlier, then things wouldn’t have 
escalated to this level. Afnan, I tried to make him understand
 a lot of times. I tried to make him understand politely, 
I even gave him money. But I don’t know how it happened 
Afnan I didn’t want to kill him. I killed him. 
I am a murderer now, Afnan. What will now happen to me? 
Police will come and arrest me now. No, nothing is going to happen 
to you. It is possible that he did not die. How can you be so sure 
that he is dead? It is possible that when you hit him, 
he only fell unconscious. That’s it. Police will take me. 
I am a murderer. Nothing will happen. 
Nothing will happen. Trust me. I have a friend. He is the head 
of the crime branch. I will talk to him. 
He will handle everything. No, Afnan. You cannot tell anyone. If you tell anyone, everyone will say 
that I killed him. And Shani will know. 
Shani will kill me. And they… Ramsha, come to your senses. Control yourself. Nothing will happen to you. I will not let anything happen 
to you Ramsha. Believe me. Just do not tell anyone about this. Do you understand? Please. Just relax and sit down. Sit. Look he is here. What kind of a ruckus 
you couple have made? Do you two have nothing better 
to do than blame each other? Now will you two still call me a liar? This video has been recorded 
and sent to me by her lover. His name is Danish Kamal. Do you need any more proof 
of her shamelessness? Yes, yes, yes. Mr. SP. I will return this favor. 
Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks a lot. I have talked to Mr. SP. He has arranged for Danish Kamal 
to be sent to the hospital. He only had minor injuries. 
He is fine. His laptop and phone are with 
the crime branch. And Mr. SP has assured me that 
your name will not be mentioned, so just relax. Afnan I do not know how 
all of this happened. I didn’t want to do any of this, but I was helpless and powerless. My name will not be mentioned, right? Ramsha, your name will 
not be mentioned. You trust what I am saying. Yes, but what if the police 
come to my house? If they arrest me, 
what will I explain to everyone? How will I show my face to everyone? 
This will never going to heppen I am with you. I will not let anything happen to you. But if your face remains ashen and stress-laden like this then everyone
 will doubt that something is wrong. They might even find out. So please, relax yourself. We got out of a problem 
like this before. We can get out of it again. You have 20 minutes. In 20 minutes, I will drop you 
at your house. Try to get into your normal zone 
by that time. Please act like I explained to you. 
Okay? Please, fix your mood now. Thank you so much Afnan. You are most welcome. Goodbye. 
Bye. Hello. Do not take a single step. Tell me, where you are coming from? From uncle’s house. I told Aunty before leaving. 
Aunty, you didn’t tell Shani? You didn’t tell Mom that you are going
to meet your lover? How shameless can you be? Sometimes your name is attached with
Afnan and then sometimes with Danish Kamal. But tell me this, how many more 
do you have hidden? No, Shani, I... I do not want to hear anything. Danish Kamal sent me your video, and everyone has seen it. 
Everyone knows that you are a… What is this? There is a limit to shamelessness 
Ramsha. What was lacking in our love, 
care, and kindness that you are doing this? You have insulted us in front of 
all our relatives. We cannot look anyone in the eye. Aunty, I…
Why did you come back? Don’t you have any decency? If you didn’t care about our dignity, you should have cared about 
the dignity of your dead parents. Thank God they passed away 
before seeing this day and this bad omen was written for us. I accept that I made a mistake, but it is not what you think. Stop it now. Don’t label your sin as a mistake. We kept you with love and care in 
our house, just like our daughter Annie. With respect. This is what you repaid us with? What have you done? We can not look anyone in the eye 
because of you. Aunty, it is not what it seems… I do not want to hear anything 
from you. What is left to say now? I can not even look myself 
in the eye because of you. Your mom died and 
went six feet under, and you have sent me to the grave
while I am still alive. You are not listening to me… Stop it. I don’t want to hear a 
single word you say. No one will listen to her here. I will not tolerate you for a 
single second in my life and I… Shani, I… I divorce you. I divorce you. I divorce you!! Danish Kamal I am warning you
for the last time. Then tell me what will you do? What will you do? What will you do? I have talked to Mr. SP. He has arranged for Danish Kamal 
to be sent to the hospital. He only had minor injuries. 
He is fine. His laptop and phone are 
with the crime branch. And Mr. SP has assured me that
your name will not be mentioned, so just relax. Okay. Afnan I do not know 
how all of this happened. I didn’t want to do any of this, but I was helpless and powerless. My name will not be mentioned, right? Ramsha, your name will 
not be mentioned. You trust what I am saying. Yes, but what if the police 
come to my house? If they arrest me, 
what will I explain to everyone? How will I show my face to everyone? 
This will never going to heppen I am with you. I will not let anything happen to you. Crying and guilt is of no use Ramsha. What has happened has happened. It is because of this reason 
I used to warn you. To stop you. The mistakes of your past have 
ruined your present and future. Do you think that I am a 
promiscuous woman? Do you really believe that? I don’t know, but what I have seen and 
heard today, Ramsha it seems that I never really understood you. You have ended everything. You have ruined everything, the beautiful relationship 
between me and you, the peace of this house, the trust of my mother, and our respect. Everything. Everyone is blaming me without 
letting me explain myself. No one heard me. Someone should have asked me 
once what happened. What was my helplessness 
that I resorted to this step? What was this helplessness Ramsha that took you Danish Kamal’s 
bedroom? Danish sent me your video, and everyone has seen it. 
Everyone knows that you are a… What is this? There is a limit to shamelessness 
Ramsha. What was lacking in our love, 
care, and kindness that you are doing this? You have insulted us 
in front of all our relatives. We cannot look anyone 
in the eye. Aunty, I…
Why did you come back? Don’t you have any decency? If you didn’t care about our dignity, you should have cared about
 the dignity of your dead parents. Thank God they passed away before 
seeing this day and this bad omen was 
written for us. Your mom died and 
went six feet under, and you have sent me to the grave 
while I am still alive. You are not listening to me… Stop it. I don’t want to hear a 
single word you say. No one will listen to her here. I will not tolerate you for a 
single second in my life and I… Shani, I… I divorce you. I divorce you. I divorce you!! Hello. Yes, Hi. Who is this? What! What happened Aunt? 
Is everything okay? Afnan, Ramsha’s aunt called. Yeah, what was she saying?
Is everything all right? Shani has divorced Ramsha. What? What happened in a few moments? Shani has left. 
The whole house is empty. Till yesterday, wasn’t this house 
filled with happiness? We didn’t even think that 
it would become so lonely. Now gloom will take hold 
of this house. My God. I do not understand this that why haven’t you kicked 
this girl out of this house? Are you listening to me? Huh. Throw this girl out of this house. She doesn’t have any right 
to stay here. If you will not do it,
I will do it myself. I am telling you this. Anwar, how can I throw her out
 of the house? She is a young girl. Tomorrow people will call us 
oppressors. I have called Afsheen. When she comes, then 
we will know what will happen. This is all because of you. This is all your doing. Your kindness has shown us this day. I told you before to be strict 
with this girl, but no, you never listen to me. Why are you forgetting that we have a young child as well? A young girl. How will these things affect her? Yes, this is what I am afraid of. That I am the mother of a young girl. If I throw Ramsha out of the house,
 people will gossip. What if God forbid this affects 
her marriage proposals? I cannot do this. We are going through 
very delicate times. We have to be very vigilant. Annie, Annie, At least you listen 
to what I have to say. Annie. The food is ready if you want to eat. Aunty, aunty please listen 
to me for once. You used to say to me that 
if my mom isn’t here don’t worry, I am your mom. Today, your daughter needs you. Your daughter is divorced. I need a mother’s shoulder to cry on. Please don’t turn away from me. Today, this is the only relation left
between me and you. Please do not end it. You ended everything yourself. I accept that I have made 
many mistakes. I have sinned a lot. But, what you have seen is not 
the complete truth. If you just listen to me once, 
I will explain everything. What I have seen and heard is not
the complete truth? Then what is the truth? What is the truth that 
I will hear today, and my heart will find ease? We provided refuge to you. Kept you in our house, 
I always defended you. I treated you like my own daughter
and this how you repaid me? Believe me, had my daughter done something
similar I would have killed her. Just listen to me once. Just hear me out completely. After that, you may kill me. I accept it.
