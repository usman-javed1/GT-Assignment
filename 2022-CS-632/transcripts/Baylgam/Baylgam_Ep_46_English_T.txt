[26.24] Excuse me,
[27.20] I think you are looking for this.
[47.40] Tabassum, get it done quickly and
 come in to help me, please.
[50.60] Okay.
[74.16] Where are you going inside?
[77.12] What is this girl doing here?
[80.16] That is Madam Ramsha,
[81.36] she lives with us, 
uncle brought her.
[83.68] She is very nice, 
she takes care of us.
[143.48] Mom? Mom?
[145.56] Yes?
[146.56] leave this, leave this, 
leave this right now,
[148.32] come with me,
[149.36] come, I need to show 
you something, come.
[150.88] Go where?
[152.24] Mom, just come,
 where is your veil?
[155.04] The veil is here only in 
the lounge on the bed,
[157.68] but tell me where are we going?
[159.08] How can I just go?
[159.88] I will bring it.
[161.32] This boy is out of his mind.
[163.40] He keeps saying come, come, 
without even telling me.
[165.76] Where should I go with him?
[167.92] Take it, take it, take it,
[168.84] hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, 
wear this quickly,
[170.48] and let’s go.
Listen to me Shani,
[172.32] I cannot just go like this,
[173.60] I have to ask your dad,
[175.00] he gets upset if I go 
without telling him.
[177.36] I will ask Annie, Annie,
 come here.
[181.12] Yes?
[181.64] If Dad asks you where is mom,
[183.68] tell him she has gone with me.
[185.32] But where are you guys going?
[187.12] I don’t know where are we going,
[189.00] Shani, listen to me,
[190.56] I hope God keeps everything well, 
I do not like all this,
[192.52] did you fight with someone?
[194.84] Mom, I am starting my bike, 
come, let’s go.
[197.00] I don’t know where this 
crazy boy is taking me,
[199.36] he is going to make me crazy.
[225.84] Hey, stop.
[227.00] Move from my way.
[228.76] I am talking about coming close,
[231.24] I mean to say that
[232.92] our hearts will get close
 if we become friends,
[236.96] you are pushing me away?
[239.60] Listen? Look, Ramsha,
[243.36] trust me,
[246.08] I will give you more
 luxuries than Afnan.
[265.28] What was going on?
[267.44] Alizeh asked me to drop
 Ramsha to the academy.
[275.64] I don’t know 
what happened to my car,
[277.12] it is malfunctioning,
[284.72] it's good you came,
[286.84] why don’t you drop her,
[289.28] let me take the car to 
the mechanic.
[295.12] Okay, then I will see you.
[301.40] wifes complain to
 their husbands,
[304.12] but Ramsha is not your wife.
[307.08] Shut up, just up.
[310.88] Answer my question.
[314.28] I am joking, dude.
[316.28] I didn’t say anything to her
[317.92] that you should be 
so mad about,
[319.80] I just said that
[321.56] if she has a problem
 in your house
[324.16] then I can make arrangements 
for her to stay.
[326.64] I know very well 
what that means.
[333.16] Everyone should know
 that this person,
[335.40] this person is a harasser,
[338.08] he has taken advantage of a 
helpless a girl without a family,
[341.56] he harassed her.
[342.68] I am ashamed to call 
you my friend today,
[345.20] a disgusting man like you 
shouldn’t be part of this society.
[366.64] Shani,
[369.72] check out the mansions 
and bungalows in this area,
[373.28] how can any of our 
relative live here?
[379.56] And sister-in-law and Ramsha?
[382.72] I don’t think so.
[388.24] I am sure you have had
 a misunderstanding,
[389.96] you took some other 
girl as Ramsha,
[391.96] did you even see her properly?
[393.28] Yes, Mom, I am the one
 who is always mistaken,
[399.04] don’t believe on anything I say,
[400.56] I am always the one who has
 had misunderstanding.
[402.56] I have asked before leaving,
[404.20] I asked their maid and
[407.56] I mentioned Ramsha’s name,
[409.32] now let’s suppose the
 face can resemble,
[412.00] how can the name
 be the same too?
[414.12] But Shani,
[416.00] Ramsha and sister-in-law never had
[419.20] any rich relatives that 
they can live here.
[422.32] Mom, it was her,
[424.28] she could be doing a job here.
[427.16] But Shani,
[428.88] you must call Mr. Qasim 
once and ask about Ramsha. 
Mom,
[433.56] you said this yourself that
[435.32] Dad should not get to
 know about this,
[437.20] now if I ask Mr. Qasim,
[438.56] the first thing that he will do is,
 he will call Dad.
[441.56] You are right but to be honest,
[443.40] I don’t understand what is going on,
[447.88] I am so worried.
[449.92] Come, they are calling you in.
[501.60] Greetings.
[503.00] Greetings.
[504.96] Greetings.
[506.96] Umm, brother is not home and 
Afnan is not home either,
[511.16] did brother call you?
[514.60] No.
[516.16] We get the packets of our groceries
 made from your shop, right?
[534.60] If brother didn’t call you then
[537.24] I am sure Afnan must 
have called you.
[539.84] No one called us, umm
[543.24] actually this is my mother,
[557.92] we are here to meet Ramsha.
[567.08] Ramsha?
[583.72] Madam Ramsha,
[585.08] some woman has
 come to meet you.
[588.76] Woman?
[592.08] Yes, she might be the teacher 
from my academy.
[595.92] You may go, I am coming.
[657.08] Yes, did you call me?
[697.28] Ramsha, my child?
[706.60] So much has happened,
 sister-in-law left us,
[714.68] and you didn’t even call us once,
[716.36] she just told us that
[718.12] sister-in-law passed away.
[731.16] My child,
[732.52] how did you bear all of this alone?
[734.84] First brother Sajid left 
then sister-in-law,
[737.84] at least you should have 
called us and told us.
[740.24] Yeah?
[740.76] You should have told us.
[746.64] But you said that
[748.00] you have no one in this 
world except your mother.
[758.48] She never considered us family.
[772.32] Coincidentally,
[773.40] I saw her here and brought 
mom here to meet her.
[781.32] excuse me,
[782.64] I think you are looking for this.
[805.52] else we would have never found out.
[816.48] But we thought that she doesn’t 
have a family
[831.76] that is why we brought her to our
 home just out of the fear of God.
[840.92] Why did you lie?
[842.60] You have your entire family here.
[854.64] Why are you standing here quietly?
[855.96] Will you say something?
[865.20] When you have your own house
[867.24] then what was the need to 
come live with the strangers?
[879.72] Why did you lie? Tell me.
[888.12] Hello?
[889.52] I cannot hear you, hold on 
for a second, please.
[896.28] I will talk to you in a while.
[900.20] My child, what is all this?
[903.00] why are you living here? Yeah?
[904.96] Aunt,
[906.88] come to my room with me,
 I will tell you everything,
[909.96] it is not appropriate to talk here,
[911.52] please come with me, come.
[913.76] You wait here for a minute,
 I will be right back. I will be back.
[973.00] Mom,
[974.80] who is this woman 
with Ramsha?
[977.68] Did we hire a new maid?
[981.72] I suggest that there are already 
so many servants in this house,
[984.72] make this Ramsha do something,
[986.84] she makes an excuse to study 
and stay in her room all day.
[991.64] She is not Ramsha’s maid, 
she is her aunt.
[1003.84] What?
[1005.68] What are you saying?
[1007.68] Yes.
[1015.00] You just call brother
[1018.04] and ask him to immediately
 come home.
[1025.72] In fact, call Afnan as well
[1028.04] and ask him to come home,
[1030.16] I need to talk about something 
very important with them.
[1036.64] Both of them father and son 
have spoiled this girl a lot.
[1047.68] I said it before that
[1049.20] this girl is not trustworthy.
[1057.36] Did you see how neatly she lies?
[1065.68] But your uncle doesn’t listen to me.
[1072.04] After all, what is going 
on in this house?
[1078.40] Now where does her 
aunt come from?
[1081.76] You just leave everything
[1083.76] and call brother, right now
[1090.44] then I will tell you what to do.
[1102.64] Hello, uncle?
[1104.20] Give it to me, 
I will talk to him myself.
[1109.96] Yes, greetings brother.
[1112.16] Brother, I need to talk to you
 about something important,
[1114.72] please come home.
[1122.12] Yes, there is a problem,
[1123.72] I will talk to you in detail 
when you come home,
[1125.60] I cannot talk on call.
[1168.72] Isn’t uncle being a little too 
affectionate on Ramsha?
[1171.92] That is what 
I was thinking too.
[1174.56] Brother never showed 
you so much love
[1178.04] and who does so much 
with strangers anyway?
[1181.64] Forget about uncle,
[1183.12] Afnan is behaving similarly too.
[1188.52] He gives Ramsha’s example on 
everything and praises her.
[1191.64] If she took a little care of uncle 
then what is the big deal?
[1198.80] But who should tell them this?
[1201.00] That is why I tell you
 to leave your job
[1203.08] and focus on your home.
[1207.60] Just look at Ramsha, 
she is such a clever girl,
[1210.20] she is always revolving 
around brother,
[1224.28] where is mom?
[1231.28] Come son, let’s go.
[1233.32] Go where? Where is Ramsha?
[1235.80] She won’t come with us.
[1237.60] What do you mean she
 won’t come with us?
[1239.44] The way your dad has treated her,
[1242.52] she is not ready to go to 
that house at all now.
[1249.56] And by the way sister-in-law 
was with her earlier
[1251.36] but now she is all alone
[1252.36] and it is better for her.
[1260.24] And anyways she is happy and 
satisfied in this house and
[1263.56] she is safe too.
[1266.76] What weird things 
are you saying?
[1269.00] We should leave her at some
 stranger’s house and leave?
[1275.00] Where is she? Call her.
[1276.04] Quiet! Speak softly.
[1279.92] This is not our house,
[1281.48] this is someone else’s house,
[1282.52] whatever you want to say,
[1283.40] let’s get home first and
 then you can say.
[1284.32] Mom, listen to me, like this…
[1285.72] Just shut up.
[1287.12] Speak slowly and let’s go home
[1288.76] and talk about whatever 
you want to. Come.
[1291.36] strange.
[1291.88] Quiet and let’s go out.
[1348.40] Ramsha why didn’t 
you tell earlier that
[1350.24] you are Mr. Sajid’s daughter?
[1353.40] Because I didn’t know 
that you know my dad.
[1356.08] You are lying.
[1356.96] Wait a minute.
[1358.64] Look, my child, you said
[1359.96] you have no relatives so
[1361.20] where did these relatives come from?
[1362.88] Uncle, when did I know that
[1364.16] you know my dad?
[1370.96] Why would I hide it from you?
[1380.72] The person who can lie once
[1382.28] can lie again and again as well
[1383.60] so then they cannot be trusted.
[1392.44] I was helpless, uncle.
[1395.52] Wait a minute, Ramsha,
[1397.96] there is no need for you
 to convince us by lying
[1400.00] about you being helpless 
over and over again.
[1404.08] Sometimes a person becomes 
so helpless that
[1407.52] they have to lie about things
[1409.52] they could have never imagined
 they would be lying about.
[1411.24] Enough Ramsha!
[1413.64] You have been lying over 
and over again
[1414.96] and all of us have been standing 
here and listening to you.
[1418.84] Uncle, you tell me yourself?
[1422.20] Do you think these 
tears are false?
[1432.08] Do you think what 
I am saying is a lie?
[1438.64] Look Ramsha, I trusted you,
[1443.16] I considered you like my
 daughter like Alizeh but you,
[1447.32] you could have told
 me the truth,
[1449.76] the truth you couldn’t 
have told anyone?
[1467.56] It is not your head bent
 down with guilt today,
[1471.84] it is my head.
[1487.36] I have got humiliation in 
the share of that love that
[1489.08] I did to you as a daughter,
[1504.68] that father has got humiliation
[1506.32] who thought that his daughter
[1509.40] would never bring shame to him but
[1513.16] that didn't happen.
[1560.68] Let’s go, Afnan.
[1578.40] But you said that you have no 
one in this world except your mother.
[1585.24] But we thought that 
she didn’t have a family
[1589.52] that is why we brought her to our 
home just out of fear of God.
[1595.72] Why did you lie?
[1597.44] You have your entire family here.
[1606.00] Why are you standing here quietly?
[1607.36] Will you say something?
[1614.60] When you have your own house
[1616.64] then what was the need to 
come live with the strangers?
[1624.08] Why did you lie? Tell me.
[1649.24] I cannot believe that
[1652.08] aunt is no longer in this world,
[1661.12] we couldn’t see her for 
one last time, mom.
[1665.08] And I cannot believe that
[1668.80] how did you go there alone?
[1684.04] You could have told me,
[1685.20] I would have come with you
[1693.60] then I would have seen
[1695.64] how would Ramsha not come back.
[1709.92] Couldn’t you give me a call?
[1720.76] That girl used to do whatever
[1724.72] she liked while sister-in-law
 was still alive,
[1727.12] now that girl
[1728.60] has gotten a chance to play openly.
[1731.24] For God’s sake, dad,
[1736.84] aunt has passed away
[1738.68] but you are still angry.
[1750.12] At least don’t say all this today.
[1753.04] What is this tone that 
you are talking to me in?
[1756.12] Yeah?
[1764.76] Don’t you dare,
[1766.80] don’t you dare to speak 
like Ramsha,
[1781.68] I am not brother Sajid that
[1783.56] I will tolerate all this,
[1784.76] do remember this.
[1787.24] Annie? be quiet,
[1790.56] be quiet, in fact,
[1791.68] get up and go away from here.
[1795.40] Shani,
[1797.04] take out the car we will go
 to Mr. Qasim’s house,
[1801.88] I don’t know what that ill-bred 
would have spoken against us.
[1807.00] I will bring Ramsha back
 here at any cost.
[1815.92] Take out the car.
[1820.52] I think that
[1822.56] Ramsha hasn’t told them 
anything about us that
[1826.20] is why we are sitting 
here peacefully.
[1833.72] If she had told the truth,
[1836.16] you wouldn’t have been able to 
make eye contact with Mr. Qasim.
[1846.72] And if you think that
[1849.36] you can do whatever you 
want in Mr. Qasim’s house
[1851.64] then by all means, go
[1859.64] else there is no use going there.
[1863.44] You don’t have to worry,
[1866.24] I will see Mr. Qasim 
and Ramsha as well
[1874.20] but you remember that
[1876.24] if your daughter ever spoke
 to me in this tone,
[1881.92] I will pull her tongue out,
[1893.44] do not complain then.
[1931.72] Instead of making this 
house a court, uncle
[1934.52] should have held that girl’s hand 
and thrown her out of this house
[1942.88] but no
[1943.88] I don’t know why
[1945.16] but that girl is still sitting
 in this house.
[1953.48] After lying so much and
 doing so much,
[1957.00] what is she doing here, Afnan?
[1959.12] Such girls are looking for
 a chance to do a big robbery.
[1962.28] What is wrong with you?
[1963.52] What are you saying?
[1965.92] You are quite educated.
[1967.24] You have gotten good 
exposure as well,
[1969.20] what has that girl done?
[1971.32] The poor girl keeps on sitting 
in one corner all day.
[1974.72] Since she has come here,
[1975.92] she has never caused 
any harm to anyone,
[1977.88] she hasn’t even moved
 a thing from its place
[1980.72] and you are making such 
huge allegations about her.
[1982.96] This is the problem, Afnan,
[1984.68] she would never do anything
[1991.08] because she knows it,
[1992.60] she would never want to be noticed 
by everyone stealing small things.
[2001.16] Try to understand Afnan,
[2003.76] she is very clever,
[2010.44] how cleverly she took 
uncle’s sympathy first,
[2019.00] she kept on pretending to be an 
innocent orphan in front of everyone
[2021.68] and then took care of him
 to make place in his heart,
[2024.64] I am telling you Afnan,
 all this is her planning.
[2026.80] For God’s sake,
[2028.32] stop making these conspiracy theories.
[2030.92] And you stop showing sympathy for her.
[2037.64] Why do you always defend her so much?
[2040.08] It is useless to argue with you.
[2048.76] Kept a thief in the house.
[2072.48] Uncle,
[2074.12] your soup is ready, shall
 I take it to your room?
[2076.08] Alizeh?
[2077.76] I am sitting in the living room,
[2079.92] tell Afsheen when she comes, okay?
[2081.88] Okay uncle.
[2082.28] Uncle, I have taken an appointment
 with the doctor for you,
[2085.04] let me come back from the
 academy then I will take you.
[2092.32] Alizeh, let me do one thing,
[2093.48] I will leave right now
[2094.40] so I will see the doctor
 on my way back,
[2095.56] okay?
[2097.08] Okay.
[2099.68] I will get the file.
[2101.12] Alizeh, my file is at the side table,
[2103.08] you bring it, hmm?
[2103.92] You go wait in the car, I will bring it.
[2148.40] Look Ramsha, I trusted you,
[2152.92] I considered you like my
 daughter like Alizeh but you,
[2157.08] you could have told me the truth,
[2159.44] the truth you couldn’t 
have told anyone?
[2170.44] It is not your head bent
 down with guilt today,
[2174.68] it is my head.
[2184.24] I have got humiliation in 
the share of that love
[2185.96] that I did to you as a daughter,
[2193.28] that father has got humiliation
[2195.20] who thought that his daughter
[2198.20] would never bring shame to him but
[2201.92] that didn’t happen.
[2225.48] I don’t understand that
[2228.72] by what relation can Mr. Qasim
 keep Ramsha in his house?
[2239.12] What is she to her?
[2241.20] What is their relationship?
[2243.76] Ramsha was telling that
[2245.04] he has made her his daughter.
[2247.80] Enough, enough, enough,
[2250.24] you let it be,
[2256.92] no one becomes a 
daughter just by saying it,
[2265.52] the situation is not like
 that nowadays,
[2268.24] we don’t know about 
a person’s intentions.
[2275.80] The environment of 
Mr. Qasim’s house
[2277.72] and his intentions
[2280.32] are way better than this house.
[2284.44] What?
