[36.60] Afnan?
[38.44] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[40.64] Get up Afnan?
[43.16] Get up.
[44.04] Mom is waiting for us at breakfast.
[61.28] Sit here.
[64.56] We are getting late, come, mom is...
Sit.
[68.84] yes, what is it?
[77.32] What are you looking at?
[79.08] I feel like looking at you like this.
[83.56] Afnan?
[85.12] We have our whole life 
to talk romantically,
[93.92] for now, let’s go mom is waiting.
[96.44] We will go in a while.
[98.56] Afnan, we will get let, lets’ go.
[101.04] No, I said in a while.
[116.28] Okay,
[119.08] our event went so well yesterday, right?
[122.08] Hmm.
[123.32] It was fun, right? 
Hmm.
[125.84] there was just one thing that 
I panicked about,
[133.04] when Ramsha all of a sudden fainted 
and fell down.
[139.88] I felt I don’t know what happened to her, 
I couldn’t even understand.
[144.44] Imagine, someone faints like 
that at our event.
[154.80] Afnan, are you listening to me?
[157.72] Yes, I am, what else should I say?
[163.36] It is even possible that she might be 
missing her mother
[174.56] because a person always misses their 
beloved people at every happy occasion.
[179.40] What do you think?
[180.76] What will I think?
[182.96] Alizeh, I don’t have that much time 
to think about her.
[191.92] If you want to know so much, 
you must go ask herself.
[198.20] Okay I will ask her. 
what is wrong with you?
[201.12] Are you mad?
[207.56] Look, she might have fainted due 
to some trauma,
[215.52] if you question her about it, 
she will relive the trauma,
[223.28] why do you want to her feelings?
[226.32] Try to understand this maturely.
[232.60] You will never ask her why she fainted,
ever again, okay?
[237.88] Okay fine, I am not saying
anything to her,
[240.76] but at least this helped 
in getting you up.
[249.56] Shall we go now?
[251.68] yes, let’s go. 
Come.
[278.72] Madam Ramsha?
[281.80] Oh God, have mercy.
[290.76] Madam Ramsha?
[292.56] Madam Ramsha?
[294.36] Madam Ramsha?
[296.40] Madam Ramsha?
[334.08] Thank you.
[337.64] Ramsha, my child, the people
[340.68] who agrees in God’s will, 
they live happily,
[346.56] the one’s who agree with His will 
have a higher position.
[353.24] Everything that God does is for good 
and is according to his will.
[358.08] If you agree with Him,
[360.16] your heart will be at peace, 
you will prosper.
[363.24] Thank God.
[369.56] Who teaches you all this, uncle?
[374.04] God, the Greatest one.
[377.40] I used to think like you as well, 
like we generally get thoughts.
[388.04] The hear becomes small,
[389.72] when you don’t get something you like,
[392.08] the heart becomes uneasy,
[401.48] why didn’t this happen?
[403.12] Why didn’t it happen 
the way I want?
[411.96] So, then I just found people 
who follow the path of God
[416.72] and then I took baby steps towards 
the path of religion
[421.16] and started learning gradually.
[428.92] The knowledge of religion has a 
lot of blessings.
[439.88] Uncle, I want to learn the knowledge 
of religion too.
[447.84] Even I want to live a 
satisfied life like you.
[457.12] I even want to have faith 
in God like you do.
[464.00] I want to live such life too.
[465.92] If God wills, If God wills.
[468.68] When I started to walk on this path
[471.84] and start learning about religion, 
I felt a very solid change,
[477.12] I felt nice.
[482.76] When you walk on the path of religion
[484.84] and study religion,
[486.80] your faith on God increases.
[489.64] Faith on God.
[495.20] The one who has faith on God,
[498.52] all the fears go away from their life.
[507.24] Don’t worry, there is this organization,
[510.64] an academy for ladies where the teach
[512.88] the deeper grasp over Islamic knowledge
and regulations to attain the Islamic way of life,
[521.20] I will speak to them if you can get 
admission there.
[525.20] Yes, that would be great,
[526.60] I will also get busy that way, uncle,
[529.56] I want to get busy anyway.
[538.12] I am tired of fighting myself,
[546.60] please get me an admission 
at your earliest.
[550.80] Why do you fight yourself Ramsha?
[558.60] My child, remember,
[561.28] forgive yourself before 
forgiving anyone
[569.80] then you will get peace and prosperity.
[576.56] Brother Saad’s wife look after 
that organization,
[579.36] she is the head there, 
so I will talk to her
[584.28] and get your admission there, 
if God wills.
[629.04] No,
[630.88] Afnan,
[632.56] Afnan, don’t leave me.
[635.28] Please don’t leave me Afnan,
[637.84] don’t go. Afnan,
[640.48] wait. Afnan,
[648.88] no. Afnan,
[652.24] Afnan, stop.
[654.84] Stop Afnan.
[655.92] No Afnan, no.
[657.60] No, Afnan, no, no.
[662.08] Afnan, you cannot do this to me,
[664.60] Afnan, Afnan, stop,
[667.08] Afnan stop, no. Afnan?
[669.48] Afnan? Stop,
[671.76] stop Afnan, Afnan no, Afnan no.
[674.40] No, Afnan? Afnan?
[677.24] Afnan, stop.
[681.64] Afnan, no, stop.
[684.16] Stop Afnan, no, no.
[685.68] Afnan?
[686.96] Afnan, stop,
[688.52] stop Afnan, no,
[689.96] don’t do this, Afnan, stop please.
[692.88] Please stop Afnan?
[694.72] Afnan,
[695.84] Afnan? Afnan?
[718.48] Alizeh?
[721.32] You were taking Afnan’s name 
in your dream?
[729.96] Alizeh, actually I saw Afnan 
in my dream,
[733.32] it was a very bad dream.
[734.72] There was something very bad 
happening to Afnan,
[736.60] I was stopping him,
[737.72] I don’t know if the interpretation of 
my dream would be good or bad,
[740.80] you just give charity for him.
[747.80] Uncle was telling if you get a nightmare 
or you are in a problem,
[752.04] you should give charity and it makes 
that problem go away.
[754.28] You must give charity for Afnan.
[768.96] What did you see in your dream?
[773.08] What difference does that make?
[779.76] I mean, what difference does that make,
[782.48] it was a bad dream and we shouldn’t 
tell bad dreams to anyone.
[791.96] You just give charity for him, please.
[912.20] What are you doing?
[913.84] I am giving charity for you.
[916.80] You take this and give it 
to someone needy.
[919.64] Charity?
[920.96] What problem did you have 
all of a sudden?
[922.88] I am fine, then what was the need 
to give charity?
[925.40] I am fine, but I am so worried for you.
[934.00] Afnan,
[935.48] actually Ramsha had a very bad dream 
regarding you.
[944.12] She asked me to give charity for you.
[948.96] Ramsha had me in her dream?
[955.04] Okay and what else did she tell you?
[957.88] Did she say something else to you?
[961.56] No, she didn’t say anything else,
[963.44] the poor girl was very worried 
about her dream herself.
[967.84] Wonderful,
[969.92] Ramsha had a dream,
[971.76] she was worried and 
you are in tension?
[974.72] So, shouldn’t I get worried?
[980.64] It has been just a few days
 to our marriage,
[983.20] if something happens to you, 
what will happen to me?
[986.52] What are you even saying?
[988.64] You killed me on the second 
third day of marriage.
[991.08] God forbid.
[992.20] Nothing will happen to me, 
Ramsha is actually,
[995.84] look try to understand her background.
[1002.64] Look, we don’t know where she is from
[1005.24] and what story has she told, 
if that’s true or a lie.
[1014.60] For now, we are believing her
[1016.92] but that doesn’t mean that the dream 
she is telling would be true as well.
[1025.56] She is telling you this dream today
[1027.60] and then tomorrow she will give you 
another story so will you believe that too?
[1030.68] No, right?
[1037.36] Look such people are psychological 
patients,
[1039.52] they are habitual of making stories,
[1047.80] but we are intelligent people, 
we wouldn’t believe them, right?
[1052.12] Don’t take it so seriously,
[1055.48] okay tell me did you have breakfast?
[1059.72] No, you come as well, 
let's have breakfast together.
[1062.76] Okay fine, do one thing, 
you get there, I am coming.
[1066.52] Okay, come.
[1080.96] he is just my dad,
[1083.84] you have no relationship with him 
so stop creating relationships,
[1087.20] understand?
[1089.16] I don’t want to argue with you,
[1092.56] you may leave. 
I won’t leave, you will leave,
[1096.08] not just from this room but this house,
[1100.88] look,
[1102.28] look, Ramsha, there have already 
been a lot of drama between us,
[1105.56] everyone is sleeping right now,
[1107.32] it’s a very good chance, quietly leave 
from here there won’t be any drama.
[1110.88] I said I won’t go,
[1112.80] can’t you understand it at once?
[1115.60] It looks like you won’t understand.
[1117.96] If you misbehave with me after this,
[1121.76] I will go and tell uncle everything 
about our relationship.
[1130.56] our event went so well yesterday, right?
[1133.16] there was just one thing 
that I panicked about,
[1137.96] when Ramsha all of a sudden fainted 
and fell down.
[1144.80] I felt I don’t know what happened to her,
[1147.44] I couldn’t even understand.
[1149.64] Imagine, someone faints like that 
at our event.
[1157.68] It is even possible that she might 
be missing her mother
[1165.20] because a person always misses their 
beloved people at every happy occasion.
[1170.20] What do you think?
[1171.44] What will I think?
[1173.60] Alizeh, I don’t have that much time 
to think about her.
[1177.60] If you want to know so much, 
you must go ask herself.
[1181.40] Okay I will ask her.
[1225.04] A B C (Urdu)
[1238.40] It is so difficult to pronounce H 
from the throat H.
[1241.08] Madam you are reciting?
[1243.08] Yes.
[1245.52] Why what happened? 
Why are you laughing?
[1247.48] What else should I do if not laugh?
I don’t understand.
[1250.40] My 5-year-old daughter recites this
[1252.96] and you are reciting this though 
you are much older.
[1256.60] Madam Ramsha, you have never recited yet?
[1259.24] I have recited multiple times,
[1261.32] in fact, in my life I have recited 
so many times during Ramadan
[1266.28] that now I have forgotten that 
how many times have I repeated it
[1269.28] but now I am reciting correctly 
with all its qualities.
[1273.00] With its qualities?
[1274.08] Yes. It is the right
[1276.84] to be recited with correct pronunciation
and proper qualities.
[1283.96] Do you know the Islamic academy 
that I study in,
[1288.04] there is a class dedicated 
for correct recitation
[1290.76] so when I started taking that class,
[1293.04] I realized that I made so many 
mistakes while reciting,
[1296.72] I never knew how to pronounce 
a lot of alphabets
[1299.36] so my teachers suggested me 
that I should recite
[1303.28] so now they are teaching me 
how to recite.
[1306.16] That’s okay madam 
but in this age?
[1309.28] Tabassum,
[1310.40] there is no age to get education or learn,
[1314.84] God shows this path to anyone 
whenever He wants.
[1320.12] And we should take advantage
 of that chance.
[1323.68] Okay madam, when you are done 
learning with proper qualities,
[1327.12] teach me as well.
[1330.08] Definitely, if God wills.
[1381.60] Afnan, I am getting ready, you get
ready in 10 minutes too
[1384.52] else I won’t go.
[1385.88] By the way Alizeh, this is very sad,
[1391.96] I have been noticing that
[1393.32] you have started being very cruel 
to your innocent husband after marriage.
[1400.60] I am getting ready in a while, 
I am just going.
[1402.56] Hey, you guys haven’t got ready yet?
[1404.80] Mom, we will go when this Afnan 
gets ready.
[1413.40] Afnan, get ready a little quickly,
[1415.76] Alizeh’s uncle will get upset.
[1417.56] He will feel bad if you go late.
[1420.52] Aunt, you know it very well that
[1423.84] I really avoid such events and gatherings,
[1426.20] then why are you pushing me 
in to all this?
[1435.52] Hey Afnan, these are the days,
[1438.16] everyone invites you for such 
gatherings after marriage
[1440.96] and everyone anyway wants you 
to be a part of their event.
[1448.16] And you know I have a 
huge family of in-laws.
[1451.04] Okay aunt, I will get ready, you…
[1455.72] Bye.
[1482.28] What happened to her?
[1483.40] Aunt, then I am getting ready.
Yeah.
[1488.24] She has joined the academy,
[1492.08] even I felt weird when I saw her 
in the scarf for the first time.
[1496.40] Anyway, it is her own choice 
what can I do?
[1499.96] Its good,
[1501.68] she is free all day at home, its good
she will get busy this way.
[1505.84] Hmm, you go get ready 
you are getting late.
[1507.92] Yes, I will go get ready.
 Okay mom.
[1555.08] Look at this Annie,
[1556.28] you know I wore this dress and 
was making a TikTok,
[1559.64] I heard dad all of a sudden so I got scared,
I quickly went and changed.
[1564.72] You were…
[1566.60] You were wearing this?
[1570.36] You will make a video in this?
[1574.92] Yes, so?
[1575.96] So?
[1578.48] Are you out of your mind? 
If uncle gets a video,
[1581.64] you will be in trouble.
[1587.92] Mom, look at Shani, 
he is accusing me,
[1590.88] I told you I went to a friend’s place?
I did tell you right?
[1594.00] She is lying.
She was at a restaurant
[1597.28] and she just didn’t have her friends there,
there were two boys there too.
[1600.36] Ask her.
[1601.44] What are you saying?
[1603.88] Aunt I am not lying, 
my friend works there,
[1606.12] he told me he saw everything.
[1607.84] What is Shani saying?
Mom, he is lying.
[1611.96] Before saying anything, 
do think properly
[1617.60] that if this is a lie, 
it will be trouble for you
[1622.24] and embarrassment for me.
[1630.52] What is wrong with you Annie?
[1631.84] Do you even know what people are 
doing these days just to make videos?
[1635.44] Do you remember that girl 
who went viral on TikTok,
[1638.00] she climbed a mountain to make 
a video and even lit a fire there.
[1641.36] And do you remember 
what happened to her?
[1643.04] She had to go to prison, 
then she even got dishonored.
[1646.52] So what?
[1647.52] We have to do anything 
to get viral today,
[1650.04] we have to get dishonored too,
its not a big deal.
[1664.80] I and modelling? 
How is that possible Hania?
[1668.28] So what?
[1669.40] What’s bad in it
[1671.44] and what is the harm in shooting 
for one magazine?
[1675.36] You can even hide this from 
your parents if you want
[1680.44] because they are giving 
a very nice package.
[1692.08] Come baby, come,
[1696.36] you actually look very beautiful 
in this dress.
[1704.68] Delicate,
[1706.44] pretty just like the heroine of my drama.
[1716.32] Just wait and watch,
[1718.68] you will go very high after working 
with me in this drama.
[1725.56] Very high.
[1731.96] Don’t worry at all, 
I won’t do anything to you,
[1735.92] I won’t do anything, 
I will kill you.
[1740.16] Hania,
[1742.04] Hania, stop him what is he doing?
[1745.04] Hania?
[1746.04] Vicky? Vicky? Vicky?
[1753.72] Vicky no,
[1755.44] Vicky no,
[1756.56] you won't do anything like this, 
I am telling you.
[1775.16] I am not a criminal,
[1777.24] I am tired of saying this again and again,
I am not a criminal.
[1781.92] Madam, you have been 
accused of a murder,
[1784.64] you have attempted murder.
[1786.36] I haven’t murdered anyone, 
this is a lie.
[1788.76] This is a false allegation, 
I am not a criminal,
[1791.32] I haven’t murdered anyone. 
Why don’t you guys understand this?
[1794.92] Madam, don’t eat my head,
[1797.08] have breakfast,
[1798.44] you are one to say you didn’t murder, huh.
[1814.60] Brother Sajid, what are you saying?
[1817.60] How can she live here while 
my young daughter is present here,
[1821.24] this girl doesn’t deserve to be 
kept in this house now.
[1823.40] Salma,
[1824.76] who are you to make my daughter
leave from my house?
[1828.24] Sister-in-law why will we 
keep this girl here?
[1839.40] Dad? Dad?
[1841.32] Uncle? Dad…
[1853.56] You shameless girl,
[1856.36] because of you,
[1858.56] because of you my fatherly brother left me,
[1864.68] because of you, you are a murderer,
[1867.24] you are a murderer of your father.
[1878.00] we have to cross this road and go.
[1879.76] Salma called she was saying 
Anwar has left to find us.
[1883.36] Hurry up. 
mom, I am so scared.
[1885.20] Nothing will happen. Hurry up. 
Okay let’s go.
[1888.20] Mom?
[1900.40] You know we ask God to give us 
a chance to offer prayers,
[1905.68] we ask God to show us the right path, right?
[1911.60] And any person,
[1913.92] any person of God,
[1916.04] when the repent with true heart
[1920.24] so all these mistakes and sins are 
washed away you know how?
[1925.28] Like we wash the clothes, 
properly drain them,
[1928.80] or like we wash the dishes by sponge 
or a detergent or a powder,
[1934.60] similarly, these tears that are shining
 in your eyes,
[1938.16] they wash away the stains like this,
[1940.84] if God sees two drops of tears 
in anyone’s eyes
[1946.96] and if they offer prayers of forgiveness, 
God forgives them.
[2010.28] It looks like I have seen you 
somewhere.
[2013.16] There is a possibility I resemble 
to any of your relatives.
[2019.04] Hey you are the same Ramsha
[2020.72] whose video got viral by the name
of shopping girl?
[2029.16] yes,
[2031.44] I am the same Ramsha, ,
[2033.52] in fact, I have buried that Ramsha 
with all the bad traits a while ago.
[2037.68] Great, you did a very good job,
[2040.72] because we all commit sins,
[2042.72] but not everyone has the courage 
to truly repent for those sins.
[2047.68] May God give you ratification.
[2085.80] Wow, both my nieces are sitting 
in front of me today.
[2094.96] God has willed. Amazing.
[2099.68] Ramsha, my child,
[2101.76] I feel very nice looking this change in you,
[2105.00] the knowledge is in your actions
[2108.24] and only a few are blessed 
with this prosperity.
[2112.36] You are lucky.
[2123.88] Thank you uncle,
[2125.96] thank God for giving me the chance,
[2138.76] May God just help me walk this path.
[2141.76] Amen.
[2143.52] May God expand everyone’s knowledge.
[2146.04] Thank You so much God, 
all praises are for God.
[2152.16] Alizeh, I was thinking
[2155.24] if you also join this Islamic Academy 
with Ramsha?
[2172.72] That course of basic Islamic education,
[2174.88] it will expand your knowledge too.
[2177.08] There are a lot of such women’s problems
[2180.64] that will be beneficial for you 
when you come across them.
[2193.40] And trust me they explain it 
in a very easy manner,
[2197.44] you will like it, what do you think?
[2202.32] Uncle you know how my routine is,
