What are you doing, Afnan? Should I open my eyes? This.. How do you like it? What was the need for this, Afnan? Why was there no need for this? Your mood was so bad because of 
me today, I thought I would give you a gift 
and convince you. Yes, but you had apologized and 
I had forgiven you too. So why this? Apologizing was not enough. The tears that came in your eyes, 
I had to make amends for those. After all, I thought that you got tears 
in your eyes because of me, then you should also have a smile 
on your face because of me. I had never thought you would care 
for me so much after marriage. Thank God. Thank you, Afnan. How is it possible? That was Afnan, Alizay. 
My eyes cannot be deceived. Why are you smiling? Mama, because your eyes are not
to blame in this, but your heart. You love Afnan so much. That is why you see him everywhere. Now you remember, when your 
friend’s daughter got married, even there you felt some boy 
was just like Afnan, but he was someone else. Alizay, someone looking like Afnan and 
Afnan being there are two different things. It was Afnan. Whether you believe me or not. Mama, I had called Afnan 
on your insistence, he was in a meeting and if he had come to Karachi, 
he would have gone straight home, why would he go to a shopping mall? Okay come, let’s go and eat. 
Come on. Let’s go. Afnan, how was your meeting? Really good. Okay, that is really good. You look really fresh. It feels you are successful
in the work you went for. Yes, that is true. Really the work I went to do,
I was successful in it. Good. What happened? Are you not happy 
on me coming home? No, nothing like that. Okay, you know, the weather in Islamabad 
was really good. I really missed you. And I missed your coffee a lot. I was thinking again and again, 
that had you come to Islamabad with me, it would have been good. When I go to Islamabad next,
I will take you with me. But, right now, make me that delicious coffee 
you make. Please. Yes, yes, sure. I will go make coffee for you. 
You rest. Greetings, Afnan. Afnan, you called after so long. I was waiting for your call for so long. You had said you would call at 
12 am and you called after so long. Yes, yes, I know I took long 
to call you, but I will call you back 
in two minutes. Okay? Afnan, even after calling after so long,
 you are saying two minutes. Please try and understand, Ramsha. You know aunt and Alizay… if they find out I am talking to you,
 then all hell will break loose. Let me find a suitable place, I will sit there and call you comfortably. Okay? Goodbye. Ramsha, I think we should sit 
in the car and eat ice cream. But why Afnan? You had said… Please Ramsha, try and understand. I don’t want that no one sees you 
and me together. Earlier aunt saw us in the mall 
and all hell broke loose. I cannot face further problems. You are regretting marrying me,
 right? What are you saying? How can you even think that? If I regret something, then it is the time when didn’t believe you. I wish… I wish I had believed you, then, today I wouldn’t have had to 
go through these problems. Now I feel like I have stolen something and I am running from people to hide it. Afnan it is possible, meeting like 
this is written in our fate. God must have a reason for this too. I worry you a lot, right? Not you, I am worried with my life. No one is happy. No matter how much I try, someone is sad. Look at Alizay, I go to her, she fights, 
she gets upset, she complains. I don’t understand how to fix 
her complaints. Afnan, Alizay is your wife. Like I have no one in the world 
apart from you, just like that, Alizay and aunt Afsheen 
has no one in the world other than you. Now even uncle is not in this world. You never leave them alone. The dresses are really expensive, 
Afnan. I have never worn such 
expensive clothes. What is wrong with you?
Look, don’t say these things. Listen, now you are Mrs. Afnan, 
understand? These things are not expensive 
for you anymore. You can buy what you want, 
when you want. Thank you, Afnan. Okay listen, the prayer time 
is passing, can I pray here? Right now? Here? Yes, Afnan, now if I pray at home,
 the prayer will get late. When there is place, 
I will pray here. I will come soon. Fine. Fine. Go and pray.
Fine, I will pray and come back. Afnan. You are here? What are you doing here? I…. I had told you it is Zohaib 
and Sana’s anniversary, so I came shopping for it. What are you doing here? Okay. Okay. Okay. Coincidentally, I came here to shop. For whom? For you. Who else will I shop for Alizay? I bought all this for you. You brought all this for me? Actually, I wanted to surprise you, but you caught me here. Thank you so much. Okay, 
show me, what is it? Okay look. Why are you looking 
at it right now, go home and see it. Okay, I have given the order 
for the gift. So you come home with me. I was thinking I will shop 
a little more, you go ahead, 
I will come later. Why? Let’s go. Come on, 
let’s go home now. Hey, I was saying..
Come on, come. Come. Come on. Ramsha, Alizay had seen me here, so I had to leave with Alizay. You please take a taxi or cab and go. You please don’t call me. Okay Ramsha, what is wrong?
Why are you crying? I am sorry. I told you I just had 
to leave from there. Okay, come on, don’t cry like this. Afnan, you don’t care about me
 even a little. You didn’t call me once 
after going home. I waited for you all night long, you didn’t even call me once at night. Now, it is morning and 
you remembered me. I really didn’t get time to call. Anyway, I had no idea, that 
you will take this to your heart. You really had no idea how 
I would come alone from there? You know, I have never felt
so alone in my life, Afnan. If Alizay is your wife, then, I too am your wife. When have I denied this? You stop crying. I am coming back. 
Okay? Hello. Hello. Afnan, where are you? I am in the office, 
why what happened? All okay? Okay. You are in the office. Yes, I am in the office. 
I had an important meeting. What happened? 
Did you want something? Okay fine, you do your meeting. Okay. Alizay. What are you doing here? How was your meeting? It went well. Why are you asking? Who was that girl? What girl? Who are you talking about? The same girl because of whom 
you lied and left the office since morning. Don’t lie to me, Afnan. Tell me honestly,
who was that girl? Alizay. Alizay, please, see, 
I was having a meeting here. All the employees are here 
they are looking. Please don’t do anything 
like that here… It is good. They should also know 
about your actions. What do you do with your wife?
 You are cheating her. Alizay, what is wrong with you?
This is not our bedroom. At least come home. Home… Excuse me, sir, what time should
I align for the next meeting? Do one thing…
Excuse me. Listen to me. Did a new girl get appointed 
at your office? Alizay, please, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? 
Let me talk to him once. Did a new girl join your office? You do one thing, leave.
I will talk to her. Please. Please. Why are you so worried? What is wrong, Alizay?
Why are you doing this? What am I doing? Now what trouble have you 
brought on my head after Ramsha. Alizay, lower your voice, 
I am giving you the last warning. Don’t do this. I am telling you… Tell me honestly, 
who was that girl? It is good that everyone should 
find out how you are cheating me… Shut up! Just shut up. Get out of this place, please. Get out of this place right now. Come here. Quickly. Where did you hide, Ramsha? What is wrong with you? 
Have you gone mad? She came to meet you here, right? Why would Ramsha come to meet me 
here? What is wrong with you? Do you even know what you did 
in front of everyone? What were you showing everyone? You were making a joke out of you and me,
both. Alizay, are you in your senses? So where did she go? She went to the academy. I don’t know where she is. But she is not here. You saw I was in a meeting 
when you came. But do you have any idea what 
you have done coming here. How dare you? How dare you to create this scene 
in front of my colleagues? Did you not have shame? Do you even have an idea how much 
you got me insulted in front of all of them? Afnan. What happened? 
What is going on? Ask this from your daughter. Who misbehaved with me in a party
with my friends. She revealed everything about the home.
She got me insulted so badly. She goes mad in her anger. Afnan, you are fooling us all. When you can have an affair with 
another woman with your wife being there, then can I not even question you? Afnan, what is Alizay saying? I am absolutely right. Ask your beloved nephew. He has an affair with some girl. I have caught him red handed. Lower your voice when talking to me. You talk to me with respect. What do you think you will talk to me 
with an attitude and pressurize me? I will not stay quiet at all. I am not here to see your drama. What do you think? You will put 
allegation after allegation on me and I will agree in front of everyone? That’s the issue with you, I come to talk to you, you scream, 
you misbehave. Why should I not scream? I will scream louder and tell everyone 
that I cheated me. I cheated you, right? 
Then you do one thing, don’t live with me. But clearly tell me today, so that my mind will be clear and 
I will make arrangements for this. For God’s sake, 
you people be quiet. It is better that you make 
your daughter understand this. What does he think of himself? How dare you insult Afnan 
in front of his colleagues. Mama, you are still blaming me? Did you not see what he did with me? I don’t know what he did 
and what you did. But you two are husband and wife, and if the husband and 
wife have an argument it should stay in the four walls, it shouldn’t go out. I couldn’t even imagine you would 
turn out to be such a stupid girl. If you had to talk about something, 
then you should have told me first, or you should have at least waited
for Afnan to come home. You should have seated him,
and then talked to him. How can you insult him 
in front of his colleagues? You are stupid. Afnan, whose voice was this?
Where are you? What is wrong with you Alizay?
I am at a restaurant, I am with my colleagues. A colleagues of mine, 
asked me for tea. Okay listen, the meeting is about to start, 
I will call you back. Bye. Hello. Yes, Afnan, where are you? I am in the office. Why? 
What happened? All okay? Okay, you are in the office. Why are you so worried? What is wrong, Alizay? 
Why are you doing this? What am I doing? Now what trouble have you brought 
on my head after Ramsha. Alizay, lower your voice, 
I am giving you the last warning. Don’t do this. I am telling you… Tell me honestly, who was that girl? It is good that everyone should find out
how you are cheating me… Shut up! Just shut up. Get out of this place, please. Get out of this place right now. Are you upset with me? No. Then why are you not talking 
to me properly? Why are you ignoring me? Okay, I am sorry. I shouldn’t have doubted you. But please, you don’t get 
upset with me further. Why are you quiet? 
Say something. When you don’t believe anything I say, you don’t trust me, then what is the point 
in talking to you? It is much better that I stay quiet. Afnan, don’t say that. When you are quiet, I get sad. I didn’t tell you a joke, 
why are you laughing? Yes, but this is no less than 
a joke for me. Do you even remember when 
we spoke the last time? It is not that Afnan, 
we talk almost daily. No Alizay, you don’t call it talking. We only fight and argue. Even if we are spending time 
with each other, then it is only with doubting each other and assassinating each other’s character. And I think it is better that we don’t spend such time together. That’s it, I have decided. I cannot live with Alizay, anymore. I will leave her.
What is wrong, Afnan? You are angry right now, leave this topic. Talk about something else. it is not about anger, Ramsha. I cannot live such a life, every moment of which is a lie. This dual life is hard to live. Marrying you, I kept you here. I deprived you of all your rights. I even feel embarrassed looking you 
in the eyes. And how can I live with Alizay? I have no respect or place 
in her eyes. If I tell you the truth, then maybe she wants to live with me 
because of her stubbornness and not her love. She feels that if I chose you over her, 
then her ego will be hurt. You cannot even think how much 
she misbehaved with me. I stayed quiet only because of aunt. If some other man was in my place, they would have taken her out 
their life right there. You did really good. If you did this because of aunt Afsheen, 
then you did good. And Alizay is not just your wife, 
she is your cousin too. You know aunt and Alizay have no one
in the world other than you. Even I didn’t have anyone 
other than them. But what did those people do with dad
being there and after he passed away. They only schemed. If they had admitted it 
with their heart that dad had supported them in their
difficult times, then today, this would have been happening. I have decided Ramsha. 
That’s it… Okay Afnan, 
leave these things. Leave this topic, 
lets talk about 
something else, please. What is the point of talking 
about something else? How long will we look away 
from the truth? I talk about something else. I am telling you, Alizay really 
misbehaved with me. All my employees were looking at me,
they were talking. What would they be thinking? I am not a loafer or goon 
from the street that I can be insulted anywhere. She is my wife. If she doesn’t care about my respect, 
then who will? Even if she had seen me, she should have at least waited 
for me to come home. Then she should have said 
what she wanted to. She should have fought, argued. 
When do I have peace in my life, anyway. Alizay never understood me and you saw all this with 
your own eyes. It is true that I had loved Alizay, but, she did all this, insulted me, never understanding me, has 
taken herself out of my heart forever. Now even if I stay with her, 
it will be out of helplessness and I don’t want to live my life 
out of helplessness, Ramsha. I cannot do it.
