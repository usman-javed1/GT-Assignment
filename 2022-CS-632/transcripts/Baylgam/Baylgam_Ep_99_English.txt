I knew you would come, I knew you would definitely 
forgive me, you will realize that it was not 
my mistake. Afnan, thank you so much for coming. I am actually innocent, 
it’s not my fault. Thank you for understanding this. Now what is your plan next? What plan? There is no need to act innocent 
in front of me, what are you about to do next, 
tell me? What plan will I have, I… Ramsha, for God’s sake don’t 
do this drama in front of me, both of you women have 
made me go crazy, but I won’t get crazier now. Where is your phone? Quickly tell me 
where is your phone? There, it’s there. Afnan?
Enter the password, enter the password quickly. Why have you kept these 
Wedding pictures with you? Because it is our pictures… So? What do you want? You want to use them against me
 as well? You have kept them 
so you can blackmail me, like you got our shopping video viral, you will do the same with 
Wedding pictures too, right? Why would I do that? Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife. You got our video viral so people 
can get to know about us, and now you will get 
these Wedding pictures viral so everyone can know we are married, but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once, what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha? Delete all these. Delete them. In fact, leave it, I have always gotten ditched 
by trusting you. Why are you doing this, Afnan? I don’t trust you anymore, Ramsha, not at all, and where there is no trust, there is nothing at all. only now I have understood 
you well, Ramsha. Only now I have understood 
who you are. I married you, made you the honor 
of my house. I fulfilled the promise I made to my dad 
who was dying and what did you do? You defamed me in the whole society, nothing else. Tell me where did my love fall short that you cheated on me? Afnan, I didn’t cheat you, If I hadn’t promised my Dad, I would have taken you and thrown you 
out of my life right here, right now. Afnan. Afnan, pick up my call, why so upset? You haven’t just made me lose
trust in the world but my own self as well, Ramsha. Afnan, just come home once, come home, sit and listen to me, give me a chance to speak at least. Please don’t disturb me. I am already going through 
tough times because of you. For God’s sake give me peace 
for a while. I don’t want to talk to you, 
I don’t want to meet you. Not because of any love or affair, I came to you because 
I felt pity for you. I felt pity on you and came to help so you can go back home with
 whatever honor is left but I had no idea you would barge 
in my life as a trouble instead. And yes, one last thing, you should still thank God 
that it was me, and I have been raised very well, had it been any other guy 
instead of me, they would have already 
compromised your honor. You have caused me a lot of pain, Afnan, I have been through so much trouble. Look I know you had to tolerate 
a lot because of me but I promise you now that there will be no tears in 
your eyes from now on. You have married me because 
you found out I was innocent so that you can give me support. Sir, these are few cheques, sign them. Please take them back, I am not doing any work today, 
bring them to me tomorrow. Ramsha, pack your bags, I am coming 
to pick you up. Don’t ask me any questions, do as I say. you are not the first man 
in Ramsha’s life, I don’t know how many men before you… Enough Aunt, Ramsha is not that type of girl, she has changed herself. She hasn’t changed, she just put on this character, and she got successful in it. And my daughter, wrong happened to my daughter, Afnan. Ramsha was my past and 
you are my present. She is your past but why do I still 
see her in your present, Afnan? In your life, in your thinking, 
in your talks, in fact, even in this house 
I just see her. Where am I? No Alizeh, look, listen to me carefully 
and try to understand it. I have heard and understood 
everything, now I don’t trust in anything you say. Sincerity, love, relationship,
none of these matters according to you? It’s not that Afnan. 
Then what is it Afnan? You did the same to me, you even considered my status, 
you weighed my love, my sincerity, all of it by my status. That was the biggest mistake
 of my life that I still regret. For God’s sake, Afnan, stop making these mistakes, because you make mistakes and 
then I have to suffer. Afnan? Don’t be scared, whatever has already happened, 
nothing more than that can happen now. The only sad part is that our marriage is not taking place
because of our love but because of that stain, you put on my character, I have to fulfill this relationship 
because of that today. Afnan, why don’t you understand 
that whatever has happened is not my fault? Whatever happened shouldn’t 
have happened but from now you are my honor, and try to not compromise my respect 
at least this time. You go inside, I will take this call 
and come. You cannot come back to our home, and anyway you are divorced and even after that he is taking such
good care of you, he married you, it is your responsibility too 
to make your home. Look my relationship with Afnan
 is about to strengthen now, there is no place for any third person, do you understand what I am saying? You? How dare you even step 
into this house? I have brought her here. She will not live in this house, 
she will get out of here, get out of here! Alizeh, Alizeh, what is wrong with you?
 Control yourself. please I don’t want more chaos
 in this house. Whatever you want to say,
say it to me, I have brought Ramsha here. I don’t want to talk about anything, if she will live in this house, 
I won’t live here. I am leaving. You don’t have to worry, you go to your room. I am just watching how big of 
a headache has this second marriage and 
second wife become for you. Look, has someone said something 
to you, Alizeh? Whatever you are saying, 
I am unable to understand. Tell me. I forgot, I forgot, I forgot you don’t want peace
in my life at all and if accidentally I am about 
to get some peace in my life, you do something that 
takes the peace away. Afnan, divorce Ramsha. Alizeh? Alizeh? Please, 
what are you doing, dude? I am already very worried, Alizeh, 
for God’s sake don’t do this else I will get mad. you have made me mad, Afnan. You brought that girl here first, had an affair with her, married her and now you want to keep her
 here again on my head. What do you think Afnan, I will quietly watch the show here? Not at all! I am not a disgusting illiterate girl
 like Ramsha, I know my rights. I am not dependent on you… you.. Alizeh, please, please 
you can’t do this, Alizeh. I cannot let you go like this Alizeh, especially not in this condition at all, 
you are my responsibility. Just think how will you even go out 
in this condition? If not about me or yourself, 
at least think about our baby, how will he get affected. Did you think about our baby when 
you were doing a second marriage? So then why should I think? You can be a father and 
still be this selfish then why can’t I be selfish 
being a mother, Afnan? Okay so that means 
you won’t listen to me? So, then I am helpless, 
I will have to go talk to Aunt and involve her in all this, 
you will get controlled by her. Af… Aunt? 
Afnan, stop. Aunt, I have no other way except 
bringing Ramsha into this house. I know I got married by my choice, this is very wrong with Alizeh but Aunt, I am the only person who has been
the most affected by all this. If Alizeh can forgive me, there should be no other reason 
except my health. My health is deteriorating 
day by day, I am unable to focus on business, the whole business is suffering loss. I don’t understand what should I do. Sometimes I think,
 if dad was alive today, I wouldn’t have been in 
so much trouble, he might have done something 
to bring peace in my life. But I beg you, Aunt, you are the elder in this house, make Alizeh understand else we can suffer damage 
that will never be repaired. It will be better for all of us.
