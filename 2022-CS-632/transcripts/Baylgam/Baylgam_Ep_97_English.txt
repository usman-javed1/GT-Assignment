Afnan, you have done wrong 
with my daughter. I don’t get it myself that 
what is happening with me. the ground is feeling insufficient to me. Since Dad has left, all the happiness and ease has 
gone away from my life. It feels like I have just gotten alone. You are responsible for 
this loneliness too. I am surprised that an intelligent 
man like you, how can he make such 
a huge mistake. You married Ramsha. Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys who are family-oriented and rich too, they marry them and that is what Ramsha did too. You are honorable, family-oriented, and rich too, she married you and defamed you and then she got famous overnight because that is what she wanted. Since that video has gone viral, do you have any idea how I am getting
 so many phone calls? From family, outsiders, I am getting so many phone calls that
I had to switch off my phone. Afnan, if you don't believe me, then go, go open social media, it is full of girls like Ramsha, who have trapped guys like you 
overnight and got famous. And by the way, you are not the first man 
in Ramsha’s life, I don’t know how many men before you… 
Enough Aunt, enough. Ramsha is not that type of girl, she has changed herself. She hasn’t changed, she just put on this character, and she got successful in it. And my daughter, wrong happened to my daughter. I have an idea that you are worried because 
of the children. Brother I have tried talking to Alizey, but she doesn’t give me 
any response. You must talk to Afnan, in fact, I would suggest you make both
of them sit face-to-face, and talk to the point. You are right, that is what I am thinking too, the environment of the house 
has become strange. Brother, we got them hooked up 
with so much love and integrity and I thought that my daughter 
would stay in front of my eyes but everything is upside down here. I cannot stay, try and understand, 
I have a problem. I don’t want to understand 
anything, Afnan, if you don’t stay here today, 
I will get upset. okay now you see, 
you are threatening me. Now it’s up to you if you think it 
as a threat or love. What is this? You are acting very selfishly. A person sometimes becomes selfish 
in love and there is nothing wrong with it. Afnan, stay away from me. Please stay away from me. Alizey, cool down and listen to me, I am telling you that you…
I don’t want to listen to anything, you did what you wanted to. I don’t want to listen to anything 
you want to say, I am hating you, your existence,
your presence. what did you think Afnan? What did you think that I will cry like a 
typical woman and die in the corner? Not at all, you have killed me 
while I am still alive, but I will kill you and that Ramsha. Listen Alizey… Now just wait and watch what I do. Alizey, listen to me, you are angry .. No Afnan, I am not angry, I guess you are not listening 
to me Afnan, just wait and watch I do now with you. Alizey? Alizey, please listen to me, 
please open the door, we can talk about this, please. Afnan, go away from here. Alizey, please. I don’t even want to see your face. 
Alizey, please listen to me. I am telling you to go away!
I can explain why I did all this. Alizey, don’t do this, Alizey, 
Please open the door. Quiet. Go away! I couldn’t even imagine Afnan 
that you will become my destiny. okay so why are you crying? This is not the time to cry. I am not crying, these are the tears of joy. I am happy. Every moment of our life 
from now onwards will be full of happiness and laughter, there won’t be any sorrow. I was mad, I was mad that I fell in love with you, Aunt even told me such girls 
never change but I, I married you, made you 
the honor of my house. I fulfilled the promise I made to my dad
who was dying and what did you do? You defamed me in the whole society, nothing else. Tell me where did my love fall short that you cheated on me? Afnan, I didn’t cheat you, If I hadn’t promised my Dad, I would have taken you and thrown you 
out of my life right here, right now. I feel disgusted in myself that 
I chose a girl like you. I am telling you not to show me 
your face ever again. No Afnan, what is wrong with you? How can you say this, Afnan? Leave me. 
What is all this that you are saying? Afnan there is nothing like this, 
Afnan why would I do this? Ramsha don’t do this. What you are saying is hurting me, 
Afnan. Afnan I will die… Die! If you want to die, then go die. And after what you have done, 
it will be better if you die. I couldn’t believe this video 
would get so viral, the video went viral more than 
I expected. Yes, Sadaf? Dude, I have been getting 
so many calls from YouTubers and channels since morning 
that what should I tell you? I feel that it might be trending 
on social media. Yes, you are right, this video got viral like fire spreads
 in the forest. Okay I will give you rest of 
the information later. Okay bye. I Knew, I knew that I would find you here. How are you, Ramsha? 
Come sit. Hey, sit, tell me what would you like 
to have? Tea or coffee? By the way, by looking at you I feel 
you need to have something cold. I feel like drinking 
your blood right now. Darling, you are getting angry 
for no reason, you should be grateful to me. I have heard that Afnan Qasim hid 
this marriage up till now. It’s good that people found out about 
your marriage with Afnan through me. Look Ramsha, 
I made your work so easy. This was my and Afnan’s personal matter, you didn’t have to interfere in it. And just because of your cheap fame,
 you ruined my life. Try to understand, dude. Forget everything, let’s make a deal, that will be beneficial for both of us. You give me some personal details 
about yourself and Afnan, some videos or pictures, etc, I will get good money for it that 
we can divide 50-50. And if anyone asks you anything you can straight up blame me for 
the entire thing and act innocent yourself. I would suggest you even cry and 
whine by calling a press conference. This is all that is happening nowadays, 
Ramsha. I feel like breaking your face right now. Do you have any shame 
or grace in you? You are ruining your life hereafter just
to make your life in this world. Girls like you are a trial! Delete all the pictures of myself 
and Afnan right now. If you didn’t delete them, 
I will file a case against you, do you understand? 
Delete them. They have been deleted. If you ever try to come between 
me and Afnan, or interfere in our matters, it won’t be good for you. Look I know that what I have done has really 
hurt you but, but what will we get 
by staying like this? Give me a chance to talk. At least listen to me. What do you want me to hear? What is left to listen, Afnan? Should I listen to the stories 
of your love? Or should I listen to the stories 
of your marriage, or I guess you want to tell me 
about how helpless were you? It is an old habit of a man like you to prove
your second marriage to be a compulsion. I understand your anger, Alizey. And I even accept that I made a mistake that 
I didn’t talk to you, didn’t discuss it with you,
didn’t inform you. Oh, you wanted to inform me? What do you think? I would have welcomed you 
in this house? I would have decorated 
this house for you? I would have accepted your marriage? Tell me, is that what you think? No, you wouldn’t have done that. Afnan, everything was going on, then what was the need to get married? You brought that girl to my position
 and made her stand next to me. You gave her your name, why did you do all this? What are you saying? What is wrong with your thinking? You know what is the problem
 with women like you? When your husband is doing 
something unlawful, it doesn't make any difference to you but when they lawfully accept 
someone and marry them, you women have an objection 
on that, it doesn’t get up to your standards. What are your standards? That pathetic girl? That TikToker who eloped 
from her house? Enough! Don’t say a word after that, Alizey, she is my wife now. You never got me respected so much,
never took a stand like that for me, today you are feeling hurt for her? Afnan, I don’t want to talk to you. Wait a minute. Yes, this is wrong. What? That you cut the call without
 even looking at it. What do you think, 
I will doubt you? No but there has to be a question, that will you ever doubt me? To be honest… Wait a minute. Why don’t you attend it? It is not very important to attend the call. 
Leave it. tell me, will you ever doubt my love? Umm, do one thing, you talk on the call, 
and we will talk later. Hey, no, it is not an important call. Pick up the call. Look I know you are feeling 
insecure regarding Ramsha, but I just want to clears that we just had temporary friendship 
between us which is not there anymore, 
it doesn’t exist. Afnan, I can’t share you with anyone, 
you know it. And that Ramsha wants to take you
away from me, I know. I know it very well. Please, you won’t leave me, 
Afnan, right? Please don’t leave me, I will get mad 
without you, I ma telling you. Yes, yes, Alizey, 
I know you love me a lot but trust me I love you a lot too I can’t even 
think about anyone except you and I promise you 
I will never leave you, please take out this insecurity 
from your heart there is nothing between me 
and Ramsha, Alizey, nothing. I am just yours. Just yours. Hello Afnan. When I don’t want to talk to you then why are you continuously 
calling me and bothering me? If I won’t call you, 
who else will I call, Afnan? Call those friends of yours who you have asked to get 
the video viral. Why don’t you believe me, Afnan? I haven’t done anything like that,
why will I do all this?
