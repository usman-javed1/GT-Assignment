[43.56] Try to understand what I am saying.
[46.44] It is just 5 lac rupees,
[49.36] arrange it from somewhere.
[51.40] And there is a huge difference between 
the currency here and there,
[55.04] you will get the money back 
in 2 to 4 months.
[57.84] It will be in your pocket and then 
you will live your life easily.
[60.48] Try to understand what I am saying.
[63.52] You even forgot how living with Ramsha 
can be so beneficial for you.
[66.64] What benefit?
[71.92] Do you remember what I said?
[75.84] If you keep Ramsha happy,
[78.68] I will give you what you want,
[82.28] I guess you forgot this deal,
[84.96] so I am offering you
 the same deal again,
[88.40] don’t cause any trouble to Ramsha,
[92.36] Keep her happy
[95.72] and it’s my job to fulfill my promise.
[99.28] I am offering again,
[102.00] take your time to think.
[146.84] I haven’t cracked a joke.
[149.08] Yes, you didn’t crack a joke but,
[153.12] in a way, I am in awe of your luck,
[160.88] how can Ramsha love a pathetic 
and selfish person like you?
[170.92] Oh hello,
[172.88] I am not here to listen to your lecture,
[184.44] I need money and you need 
Ramsha’s happiness,
[194.00] and right now we both are the need 
for each other, understand?
[206.04] Now tell me, do you agree 
with what I said?
[211.16] Do you know what?
[214.48] If Ramsha didn’t love you,
[226.16] I would have said it right here right now 
to you leave Ramsha and get out of our lives
[241.48] but sadly,
[244.48] the poor girl is fulfilling her responsibility 
of being a wife.
[253.24] She wants to live happily with you,
[256.68] which is why I cannot say 
anything to you.
[262.68] You must have done at least 
one good deed in your life
[266.48] and you are being rewarded for it 
in the face of Ramsha.
[270.36] Anyway…
[272.28] No, no, no, do you know 
what the actual thing is?
[275.68] I don’t know about my good deed
[283.16] but I remember all the sins of Ramsha
[294.00] and I am the punishment of her sins.
[298.68] Write the cheque.
[329.36] Here.
[388.08] Your wife is squirming here 
in front of you,
[391.64] she is pain and you don’t care about her? 
What kind of a husband are you?
[394.92] I have told you it’s a husband and wife’s
personal matter, do you understand?
[402.12] Don’t interfere else…
[403.36] Else what? Tell me what will you do?
Tell me?
[406.40] Afnan? Afnan,
[409.28] Afnan please you don’t interfere 
in our matter.
[417.04] This is my and Shani’s personal matter
[418.92] uncle please take Shani away 
from here.
[425.76] I have lost my child
[427.68] now I don’t want to lose my husband,
please Afnan leave.
[463.00] So that means her tears have 
brought you to a nobody like me?
[470.08] By the way my wife is very fortunate,
[474.12] I mean,
[476.00] someone else also cares about 
her tears apart from her husband.
[481.72] It’s not that,
[485.08] I am telling you that you are having 
a misunderstanding
[487.24] you should let the poison of doubt 
out of your heart.
[490.48] I am telling you again and again that 
she loves you a lot being your wife.
[495.16] There is nothing between us. 
And she is not well,
[500.48] she doesn’t feel good,
I am afraid that God forbid,
[503.64] something happens to her 
in this condition, then?
[507.52] It doesn’t make any difference to me.
[511.24] What you have done can ruin 
her home instead of making it,
[514.96] what is this foolish step?
[516.64] Thank God that Shani didn’t see you with 
Ramsha else he would have created havoc.
[526.12] I even advised you and warned you
[530.04] to stay away from Ramsha’s matters, 
I told you
[537.88] and now this is the last time
I am warning
[541.72] if you ever do any sort of interference 
in Ramsha’s matter,
[547.96] it won’t be good for you.
[560.84] Oh hello,
[562.80] I am not here to listen to your lecture,
[566.52] I need money and you need 
Ramsha’s happiness,
[569.68] and right now we both are the need 
for each other, understand?
[575.04] You must have done at least 
one good deed in your life
[578.80] and you are being rewarded for it 
in the face of Ramsha.
[583.32] Anyway…
[585.00] No, no, no, do you know what 
the actual thing is?
[588.80] I don’t know about my good deed
[594.00] but I remember all the sins of Ramsha
[598.24] and I am the punishment of her sins.
[614.56] I just don’t know what to tell?
[617.28] Shani is so angry, we are so worried
 because of him.
[631.16] I and Shani’s dad were thinking not 
to force him for no good reason,
[636.40] he might do something wrong.
[650.44] Umm, yes, you are right but also think
[655.44] that after all how long can Ramsha 
stay in our house for?
[669.68] She is not our but your responsibility.
[674.52] Yes, yes, you are absolutely right,
[677.56] actually brother Qasim the thing is that 
I don’t have the courage to face you,
[685.08] I am very embarrassed,
[695.64] I just have a request to make to you,
[698.32] keep Ramsha in your home for 
a few days to stay,
[713.40] meanwhile I will talk to Shani 
and convince him
[717.64] and then we will take Ramsha home.
[719.44] Look, there is no problem 
in keeping Ramsha here,
[723.76] in fact, this is her house but 
she is not happy here,
[739.44] she is very desperately waiting 
for Shani and you all.
[751.12] You do one thing, call Shani 
I will talk to him.
[755.36] Exactly and look accidents happen 
everywhere
[767.48] but that doesn’t mean at all that someone
should leave their wife like they have no one.
[774.28] Call Shani, please I will talk to him.
[778.16] Anwar is absolutely right, actually,
[781.32] Shani is not even home right now,
[783.44] and we promise you,
[786.40] let the issue cool down a little,
[788.88] we will come and pick Ramsha ourselves,
we promise you.
[793.08] Yes, yes. Absolutely,
[795.04] that is going to happen, 
exactly that.
[833.28] How can you do this, Shani?
[836.72] We decided that you will take away Ramsha
from here after taking the money from me.
[841.64] Now you cannot back out.
[843.68] Shani, I am telling you that you have 
to do all this for Ramsha…
[854.04] What price have you put out on me?
[858.20] Look Ramsha, whatever I am doing 
is for your happiness.
[861.16] Happiness?
[870.08] According to you, happiness is weighed 
through money, Afnan?
[883.16] According to you, there is no value of 
sincerity, love, and relationships.
[888.84] It is not that.
[890.04] Then what is it, Afnan? 
You did the same to me.
[904.64] You saw my status, not my love, 
my sincerity…
[916.92] You weighed everything 
by my status.
[919.56] That was the biggest mistake of my life,
[928.44] and I still regret it.
[935.48] For God’s sake, Afnan,
[938.64] stop making these mistakes
[944.12] because you make mistakes and 
I have to suffer.
[1063.92] Alizeh, what happened? Why didn’t 
you come for dinner?
[1074.32] Alizeh, are you feeling well? 
Why are you not saying anything?
[1085.28] Alizeh, answer me, what happened?
Why are you sitting like this?
[1091.88] What do you have to do with it?
[1095.24] Why wouldn’t I have anything 
to do with it?
[1097.44] I am your husband, 
I care about you.
[1106.08] Afnan, don’t make more mistakes
by caring about me.
[1115.08] You have already made a lot of 
mistakes in your life,
[1126.00] like marrying me,
[1134.40] not marrying Ramsha,
[1141.20] you regret all this, right Afnan?
[1146.84] it means,
[1149.96] it means you overheard the conversation
between me and Ramsha?
[1153.16] Mmhmm,
[1155.92] I didn’t overhear anything I was just 
passing by so I kind of heard a few things.
[1162.80] Look Alizeh, it’s not what you think,
[1173.48] Ramsha was my past and 
you are my present.
[1183.56] She was your past but why do I still 
see her in your present, Afnan?
[1194.32] In your life, in your thoughts, 
in what you say,
[1198.08] in fact, even in this house, 
she is all I see.
[1208.28] Where am I?
[1210.88] No Alizeh, look listen to me carefully 
and try to understand.
[1214.80] I have heard and understood everything,
[1223.88] I don’t trust anything you say now.
[1236.84] Alizeh? Alizeh?
[1278.16] You did great that you came here 
to pick Ramsha
[1281.56] and you chose forgiveness.
[1283.96] The relationship between a husband 
and a wife is very sensitive,
[1286.52] if there is any contradiction 
or a misunderstanding
[1289.08] between a husband and a wife,
[1289.64] only the devil gets happy.
[1291.88] You chose to forgive. 
You sit down,
[1294.32] I will call Ramsha, okay? 
Have a seat. Stay blessed.
[1320.64] By the way, despite of so much happening,
 I still brought you back.
[1332.60] By the way you know what? 
Not everyone gets such a husband
[1342.24] who ignore all the mistakes of his wife.
[1351.04] What?
[1352.20] Why are you looking at me like this?
[1357.92] I am telling you the truth and look 
you have always humiliated me.
[1368.84] I remember that the first time there was 
a word of our marriage being spoken,
[1373.76] what happened?
[1375.32] You clearly refused and 
I haven’t forgotten it
[1388.72] but still,
[1390.96] I thought about my late Uncle and 
aunt so I brought you back.
[1404.60] But I am telling you once again,
if it was someone else in my place,
[1408.44] they would have thrown you out
of their life.
[1411.48] You didn’t do me any favor,
[1414.00] it would have been a favor from you
[1416.12] if you would have brought me here 
with love and kindness.
[1422.92] You have taken money from Afnan to 
bring me back from there to here, right?
[1429.92] Yeah?
[1430.84] Tell me, how much money did you take?
[1434.16] Money?
[1435.76] Don’t act like you don’t know, Shani,
[1437.72] you have taken money from Afnan 
to bring me back here,
[1440.60] tell me how much money did you take?
[1457.00] Thank God,
[1458.72] Shani brought Ramsha back, 
the boy got some sense now.
[1464.72] I don’t understand
[1468.28] that how will they live their life?
[1476.32] Disagreements are very common 
between husbands and wives
[1480.44] but this doesn’t happen anywhere 
that they fight 24/7.
[1486.60] Forget it, both of them…
You don't deserve to be lived with.
[1491.08] What are you doing? You are escalating
 the issue for no reason.
[1497.88] For no reason?
[1501.48] I am escalating it for no reason? Yeah?
[1506.72] Are you even ashamed, Shani?
[1509.08] I am not going to live with you 
anymore now
[1511.20] because I am not shameless 
and shallow like you.
[1518.48] You haven’t left me capable to face 
anyone, you have hurt my integrity.
[1522.16] I don’t want to live with you.
[1524.20] Ramsha, listen to me.
[1531.92] What is this noise? 
It is Ramsha’s voice.
[1535.52] She is fighting with her husband 
right after coming back.
[1542.88] She should be thanking God that 
he brought her back
[1551.52] and she started to fight right 
after coming.
[1553.28] Hey we don’t know the issue, 
you are calling it a fight.
[1559.08] You must try to make your 
daughter-in-law understand,
[1565.72] put some sense into her,
[1567.56] tell her it’s not nice to fight with 
her husband all the time.
[1571.72] Hey, at least you keep quiet, 
come let’s see what happened. Come.
[1586.08] I said I don’t want to live, 
means I don’t want to.
[1587.92] Ramsha, you are escalating the issue, 
keep the bag back.
[1591.20] Go keep it inside. 
Shani?
[1594.00] What is this noise you guys 
are making at midnight?
[1605.68] And you, what have you been doing?
[1609.16] You should be thankful
[1611.52] that despite your mistake 
your husband brought you home
[1627.04] and you are fighting on top of it?
[1629.24] You are such an ungrateful woman.
[1632.32] Really? Did I start the fight?
[1635.60] Ask your son why he brought me back?
[1648.76] Ask him what was the reason to 
bring me back, what was the love?
[1660.36] Tell them, Shani?
[1662.52] Will you tell, or should I? Tell them.
[1671.84] Ramsha, I beg you.
[1683.28] Please, go inside the room,
we will talk about it.
[1695.40] Go inside the room.
[1703.56] What is this? What is the matter?
[1707.08] When she was leaving easily
[1709.24] then what was the need to beg?
[1713.44] You never begged us and you are being
a slave to your wife?
[1718.44] Dad, this is the matter of us 
husband and wife,
[1721.20] don’t interfere in it. 
Huh?
[1728.24] Did you see it?
[1730.28] Did you see your child?
[1732.64] What did your child say?
[1736.68] He is begging his wife,
[1739.68] this is the kind of shameless 
children nowadays,
[1742.60] they can just argue with their parents
[1746.16] and they will be quiet in front of their wives 
and will beg them.
[1753.48] Hmph!
[1754.52] Matter of husband and wife. 
Shameless.
[1801.64] Ramsha.
[1806.60] Afnan.
[1809.52] Sit down.
[1810.72] Umm hand.
[1812.44] Sorry.
[1824.00] You don’t care about me at all,
[1825.60] that shows I am not important 
for you at all.
[1830.80] Really,
[1832.96] look at me.
[1835.88] Hey, look at me.
[1839.60] Yes?
[1843.28] If you weren’t important to me,
[1846.68] I wouldn’t be here today.
[1850.88] Okay, enough.
[1853.48] Okay look at today’s videos.
[1870.60] Listen?
[1872.48] Where did you get these bangles from?
They are very nice.
[1874.84] These are just crystal bangles.
[1876.52] So, what if they are crystal?
[1879.56] That’s a big thing, 
who likes crystal bangles?
[1882.20] You like them by the way. 
I really like bangles in girl’s wrists
[1885.92] but they look very special 
in your hands.
[1890.08] Thank you. Then I will wear them 
daily from now on.
[1900.88] Not because of this love and all,
[1903.28] I came to you out of pity,
[1905.92] I came to help you because 
I felt pity on you,
[1909.28] so you could gather your leftover honor
and go back home
[1913.48] but I didn’t know that you will 
become a pain for me instead.
[1919.44] And yes, one last thing,
[1921.72] you must thank God that it was me
[1925.72] and I have been raised well,
[1929.08] if it was any other guy instead of me,
[1932.32] he would have brought so much 
disgrace to you.
[1958.72] Do you actually not love me?
[1961.64] Yes, I truly, falsely, in any world, 
I do not love you, Ramsha,
[1966.68] but why don’t you understand, Ramsha?
[1976.20] According to you, there is no value 
of sincerity, love, and relationships.
[1981.80] It is not that.
[1983.00] Then what is it, Afnan? 
You did the same to me.
[1987.88] You saw my status, not my love,
my sincerity…
[1992.28] You weighed everything by my status.
[1994.64] That was the biggest mistake of my life,
[1998.20] and I still regret it.
[2000.16] For God’s sake, Afnan,
[2002.88] stop making these mistakes
[2007.04] because you make mistakes and 
I have to suffer.
[2023.88] Are you telling the truth?
[2025.52] Just like you I couldn’t believe it too, 
I was surprised too.
[2028.96] Brother was never like this,
[2030.56] he has gotten this craze of moving 
to Dubai because of Wasim,
[2033.48] else he was never like this.
[2041.76] That’s such a disgusting thing to do.
[2044.96] Look, I cannot even face Afnan 
because of the pathetic thing Shani did.
[2056.96] I wouldn’t even have found it out 
hadn’t I heard it
[2059.80] because Afnan would have never told me.
[2069.40] I am very angry on Afnan too.
[2078.64] He shouldn’t have given money to Shani,
[2080.60] who gives such huge amount.
[2083.88] Afnan is a very nice man,
[2092.48] the care brother should be doing for you, 
Afnan does it.
[2104.96] I am right, Afnan takes 
very good care of you.
[2113.56] Even a family never does this much
[2120.56] but whatever it is,
[2123.92] brother has done a very disgusting act, 
he shouldn’t have taken the money.
[2129.24] You cannot keep anything 
to yourself, right?
[2142.28] I even asked you not to tell
 anything to anyone.
[2146.28] You should be ashamed, brother,
[2159.48] you have lost your mind in the craze
of going abroad
[2161.96] that you didn’t care about your respect, 
honor, shame or anything?
[2179.04] You have taken money for your wife today,
in future you can sell your sister…
[2181.60] Shut up!
[2194.44] Uff ho! Shani?
[2196.60] What is this behavior?
[2197.88] Did you raise your hand on your sister?
Where did you learn that from?
[2202.08] And what did she even do? 
What was the reason
[2204.72] that you had to slap her?
[2220.12] You tell me Ramsha,
what happened?
[2238.64] Nothing.
