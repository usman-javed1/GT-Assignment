You know it very well,
 if something goes away from me, I start craving it more. And you, you are an addiction for me, addiction. Stay in your limits. I am not that Ramsha from before, I am not interested in 
you or your field. But I am interested in you, very much interested, so I want you to work, just for me. Look, you are wasting your life 
by living in this ordinary house as the wife
 of an ordinary man. You have made your life very cheap. A cheap girl is someone who leaves her husband and runs after men like you, fame, Money, and forbidden things. A good wife spends her life loyally 
with her noble husband but what would you know about it, you have never had 
a modest woman in your life. Whoever is habitual of eating
 forbidden things, wouldn’t know the deliciousness 
of what’s permissible. Listen? Ramsha, mom is calling you. Okay. Okay, is this the one? Yes, this is the one. Come have tea. Yes, wait a minute. Your papers look fine, here take it, they are fine. Dude, let’s have tea some other time, it is due on me, since I have seen the house now, I will keep on visiting, it is like my own house. It is good. No, no, no, it’s okay. this is fine, right? Yes, yes, absolutely. I will contact you then. Sure, sure. Enough Dad, enough of this workout, 
I am tired let’s just sit now. Good job, son, it is my age to get tired, 
and you are getting tired? What is this? sometimes a person makes some 
decisions that make them tired. Afnan, so you know that when a person plans something they feel their planning is perfect but the truth is perfection 
is just there, there is no perfection here, 
we can just try. He is the only infinite rest 
everyone is temporary, and when the result of that so-called
 plaining turns out to be zero, then we realize the value of it, it is nothing, we are all helpless in front of 
His planning and his decisions. Dad, after marrying Alizeh I feel that our relationship has
 imprisoned me in a room where there is no light, 
air that can enter. To be honest, dad, I feel suffocated. It feels like gradually
 I am losing patience. Don’t say like that, Afnan, don’t say like that. Do you know the devil is the biggest beneficiary 
of the fight between a husband and a wife and you are my son,
 I am sure you won’t do anything that makes 
the devil happy, he is the one who creates 
misunderstanding and bad thoughts. Come, let’s take another round. No, no, Dad. Come, come. Keep these clothes. Serve the breakfast. You are wasting your life 
by living in this ordinary ... ...house as the wife of 
an ordinary man. You have made your life very cheap. A cheap girl is someone who leaves her husband and runs after men like you, fame, money, and forbidden things. A good wife spends her life loyally 
with her noble husband but what would you know about it, you have never had a modest 
woman in your life. Whoever is habitual of eating
 forbidden things, wouldn’t know the deliciousness 
of what’s permissible. Hello? Who is it? The person who is unable 
to forget you. Do you know Ramsha, since I met you, I have been thinking about 
you ever since then. Why are you bothering me? Why are you troubling me? What is your problem? Sweetheart, sweetheart, if I just let your husband know that you have spent a lot of days 
in my house with me, so you know it better than I do what will happen to you? What rubbish? Are you in your senses? Why? Isn’t that true? Look, Danish Kamal, why are you bothering me? Why are you causing me trouble? When we don’t have anything 
to do with each other then why are you after me? What do you want from me? Yes, now you have come to the point. I want to meet you. When and where? I will call you later and let you know. And don’t even think about refusing, if you do, you know it very well, as to, what can happen to you, the next call I will dial from
 my number on your number. Don’t even try to block my number
 or switch off your phone, because if you do that, I will call your husband’s number then and you know it very well, what will happen to you if I do that. One more thing, don’t take me easy, because the person 
who can come to your house, won’t take very long to get to 
your room, yeah? Sweetheart. Listen to me. You are standing here, 
I asked you to serve me breakfast. I really miss Uncle, I am thinking to go meet him. Okay, let Shani come back, I will ask him to take you there. Not with Shani. I mean he comes at night, uncle sleeps after Isha, you know that, Aunt. It won’t look nice to 
disturb him at night. Okay then I will ask 
Annie to go with you. Annie? Annie? Annie? Yes, mom, I am coming. Yes, mom? My child, Ramsha is going to
 Mr. Qasim’s house, do one thing go with her. right now? Yes. Umm, mom, Nazia just called, she is coming here with her mom, she is coming to give an invite
 for her brother’s wedding. Now I said yes to her. If you had told me a while ago, I would have refused but it doesn’t look nice to 
refuse after calling them home. Okay. Annie, why do you worry? Aunt, don’t bother her, I will go alone, what’s the big deal? Okay, you may go and give my regards to brother Qasim. And come back soon. Okay. I will do this, go. How are you, sweetheart? I was sure that you would definitely come. Sit down. I haven’t seen a person as
 pathetic as you in my whole life. You haven’t seen 
me being pathetic yet, I have to show that to you. Sit down. I didn't come here to sit. Talk about whatever 
you wanted to say. I am saying that only,
 I need to show you something. What? How pathetic I am. Shall I? I have seen that. I have seen it very well. No, no, you haven’t seen it yet. Look at this. These pictures and videos, how did you get them? You can’t even think where do I have hidden
 cameras in my house. I haven’t seen a person as 
pathetic as you in my whole life, don’t you have any shame? Leave my collar. Leave it. Sit down. Next time, if you don’t listen to me, your pictures will be sent
 to your husband first and then in your families and then you know it very well where will they go. That’s like a good girl. If you do something similar 
in a public place ever again, you will get in a lot of pain. Come on, tell me, what will you drink? Tea, coffee, or something cold? Tea. You know I don’t keep loans, I return them with interest. What a look. Wait a minute. What is all this? Sir’s friend has gardens of fruits, so he has sent fruits, Sir has asked to send a few cartons
 to Madam Ramsha’s house. okay, do one thing, 
keep them in my car, I will drop them at Ramsha’s. okay, fine. My Lord, you are very merciful, you forgive everyone’s mistakes, oh Lord, I have committed a lot of sins, made a lot of mistakes, if you don’t forgive me, I will be ruined, if you didn’t forgive me and have mercy on me, so, we will be amongst the ones at loss, Oh  God, for the sake of your Prophet
 Muhammad (PBUH) Forgive me. I am a sinner, I confess my sin, save me from getting destroyed. Save me, my Lord. Save me. Ramsha, you have been offering
 prayers for so long, I came earlier once so you were offering prayers, you are still sitting on the prayer mat. Did you offer prayers? Yes, I just took long to pray today. Did you have some work from me? Ramsha? My child, your eyes are red, are you crying? Yes, I just felt like crying
 while praying today. By the way, I have noticed that you offer prayers with 
a lot of interest these days and pray by heart too, that’s good, God likes it. And yes, Afnan is here. Afnan? Yes, he is sitting in the drawing 
room downstairs, Mr. Qasim has sent a few things so you go sit with him, I will go make tea, hmm? Are you well, Ramsha? Yes, I am fine. You look worried. Looks like you came here 
directly from office today. You should go home, Alizeh 
must be waiting for you. Don’t change the topic. Answer my question, why are you worried? I am not worried, Afnan. I am fine. I don’t know why you feel that. And it’s not necessary that 
what you feel is true. I think you must leave now. Ramsha, wait. What were you doing in Hotel Starlight? Please now don’t say 
you didn’t go there because I saw you there 
with my own eyes. What were you doing there and why were you crying? These pictures and videos, how did you get them? You can’t even think where do I have hidden 
cameras in my house. I haven’t seen a person as pathetic 
as you in my whole life, don’t you have any shame? Leave my collar. Tell me. Answer me, what were you doing there? No, why should I answer you? I am not obliged to answer you and you don’t have any 
right to question me either. We had a relationship of 
obligation and responsibility, it is not there anymore. What happened? 
Why haven’t you slept yet? Switch off the light. Why haven't you slept yet? At least answer me. Shani, I feel heavy that is why 
I have switched on the lights. Shani, actually… I know it very well that 
why aren’t you sleeping. You must be missing 
one of your lovers. Whatever it is, switch off the lights and 
let me sleep at least. Afnan, what is this? You have breakfast 
alone on Sunday, where is Alizeh? What is it? Why are you smiling? You are talking as if you don’t know 
the reason hidden behind my smile. Alizeh, she is sleeping. She doesn’t give me time though, but she has to sleep well on Sundays. I don’t know what is Alizeh doing, I will have to talk to her. No aunt please, if you will do anything she will feel I have complained
 to you about her, and that will mean 
she will again argue and fight with me and there will be a scene 
in the house yet again. For now, I am not in the
 mental state to bear all the drama. Let her be how she is.
