You guys must have gotten 
a good idea now, that what an illiterate person have you 
handed over a girl like Ramsha. I was refusing you guys from
 the very beginning that please don’t get this marriage done, 
but no one listens to me in this house. My God knows that I had no idea 
that Shani is like this, just met him two to three times. So dad, we should have investigated first. I am sorry dad, I just meant to say that let’s suppose that if it was another girl 
from our house instead of Ramsha, you would have investigated well 
before making a decision, right? I was just saying it because of this. Afnan, we investigate for strangers, they are her own family. And Ramsha married by her own will. You are having a huge 
misunderstanding, aunt, Ramsha wasn’t willing to get 
married here at all, ask your daughter who used to blame her over
 everything and anything. And dad, dad now said that she will be
 going to the hostel, what else would the poor girl do? Whatever had to happen, 
has happened, why are you blaming all of us? First of all behave yourself, I am very angry right now. And didn’t you all see it yourself that Shani is such an ill-mannered guy? Just think how will the poor girl 
survive there? Shani is not a stranger to Ramsha, Ramsha has grown with those 
ill-mannered people all her life, she has lived in the same house, I think you don’t have 
to worry about her. Did you see how he was talking to me? Relax. Sit down. If you have forgotten your past, what do you think people will 
forget your past too? Your videos, your pictures, they are just a click away 
from people. The disgusting videos and pictures 
that you have uploaded, they haven’t been removed from 
the minds of men. No one gives respect to girls like you, I am surprised about the fact how brother made you his daughter? Do you have any idea how much favors have brother done 
to you and your mother? And what did you give him? 
Depression? Distance from his son? Look madam, if you are even a little sincere 
with brother, then marry your cousin. And leave this house forever 
and ever and never ever come back again. Why are you acting so pious? Have you forgotten your past? I knew it, I knew very well about your 
shallowness. Yes I am shallow, you got me
absolutely right, and after the marriage, you will realize
that I am not just shallow but very pathetic too because I have remembered everything and I will take revenge for 
each one of it. You had arranged so much, 
what was the need of this formality? I will tell you, actually they feel that 
we don’t get to eat all this that is why she got 
so many things made and I understand that all this is being
done to brag it to me, and if you won’t brag it to me 
how will you degrade me? No, no my child, 
there is nothing like that. We just expressed our love and 
affection towards you, if you disliked something, I apologize. No, no, actually it is my fault that I came here 
on his invitation because he just had one purpose, they had called me here to humiliate me
and degrade me, what else? Enough, Shani, For God’s…
What do you mean by enough? Don’t you see how 
they are humiliating me? If you have to be humiliated here 
and eat then you may eat! I am leaving. Let’s go Ramsha. Greetings, Mr Qasim. Greetings, may peace be upon you. How are you? I am fine, by the grace of God but I feel Ramsha is not fine 
in your home. Umm, actually, Mr Qasim, I understand 
what you mean. Trust me when Shani came home, I scolded him a lot, even his mother scolded him a lot. My son is just a little bitter by tongue but he is very good at heart. Only God knows what’s inside 
one’s heart, Mr Anwar, a person’s attitude is figured out 
by how they speak, you can judge a person’s brought up 
only by how they talk and behave. Yes, yes, you are right. Actually Mr. Qasim, 
I will talk to you later, actually, I am at the shop and 
there is a lot of rush, I will talk to you later. Okay fine, bye. Bye. What happened? Dad, I am tired of this bike. The petrol is also full but 
it still won’t start, even my friends make fun 
of my bike now. It’s not like you don’t have money. Dad, you are saying as 
if you have a bank and now it’s time for you to increase
 my pocket money, I am married, it is not a joke. So why are you crying? Is it a problem for you to 
get a new bike? Listen, talk to Ramsha, she will ask Mr Qasim and 
you will get a new bike. Why are you looking at me like this? I am absolutely right. Mr Qasim has a lot of money, he shows so much love for our Ramsha, can’t he do this for her? I will suggest, forget about the bike, talk about car, car, if we get a new car at home, 
it will be such a facility for us, are family is growing, two bikes won’t be
 enough for us. And think about your mother, if we will have a car at home, it will be easy for us to take her 
to the hospital. If not about yourself,
think about your mother. Do you understand, okay now let me start. In the name of God. Here. This is called old is gold, go now. Car. Car. Brother? I asked you to cook meat,
 you haven’t done it yet? What happened? 
What happened? Go see, Ramsha is working 
in the kitchen. Aunt. 
I asked you to do it. What happened? Why are you 
getting so angry? I have kept the meet for cooking 
and knead the dough as well, now we will make piping hot bread 
before dinner and then eat it. Don’t scold her please. My child you are a newly wed bride, how many days has it been 
since you got married, it doesn’t look nice to make you 
do all house chores. Aunt, what is wrong? It is the same if I work or Annie do. And I have to work later on as well, anyway, so isn’t it better if I do now? By the way, I get very surprised when I look at you, you would never touch any work before and now you have taken care of the entire 
house as soon as you came here. Thank God that I got rid of me, else mom used to be after 
my life all the time. It’s good Annie, you must just focus 
on your studies. When I look at you I realize that 
I wish I would have focused on my studies so I would have been somewhere today. But Anyway, you have to study well so you can do something big 
in your life, hmm? I promise, I will study with full 
concentration, thank you Ramsha, you are very nice. If I had someone else as my 
sister in law, mom, so she would have made me do all the work
and wouldn’t have done anything herself. Hey, what is this? You are making my newlywed bride work? We are not making your bride work, she is running around the whole house
and working herself. Okay I don’t know anything today, I and Ramsha are going out for 
an outing today. You go get ready. What? Okay what is there to make fun of? Since we have gotten married, 
we haven’t gone for an outing, in fact, cook the food yourself today. Okay, okay, fine, fine.
Okay okay. We will have dinner outside. Why are you looking at me like this? Go and get ready then we will leave. My child, quickly leave, leave, my son’s plan might change. Quickly go. 
Go. You guys are making her work. Hey? You are so clever, you get ready yourself as well. Mom, you know that is my style, 
I don’t need to get ready. And I don’t understand one thing, why were you laughing in front of her? you guys were making fun of me? Hey, we weren’t making fun of you, we are happy, at least you realized about 
her yourself. That’s great. Listen, wear this. If you don’t like it then wear something 
of your own choice. No it’s fine, it’s good. Okay then get nicely ready. We are going out for the first time. What happened? You don’t look happy. When did I say that? Your face seems like it, else wives get really happy 
when going out. I am happy. I am very happy, in fact, I am very shocked too that you never asked me to go out, you never took me out for dinner 
or an outing so all of a sudden, 
why being so generous? You know that I am a bit moody. And plans will be made like this now quickly get ready, okay then we will leave, 
I will change too. Get dressed nicely, okay? it is a such an expensive restaurant, 
Shani, why have you brought me here, do you know the bill will be 
so high for this food. Ramsha, why do you worry 
about the bill? Am I worried about the bill? If I am not worried about it then 
why are you worried? And by the way I have brought you 
out to a restaurant for the first time, I couldn’t have taken you 
to any mediocre place. Yes, but this restaurant seems 
so expensive Shani, and if you will do this, 
your budget will get off. Yes, but I will accept this for your happiness. You just tell me are you happy? you thought so much for me, why wouldn’t I be happy? Thank you so much. Our life will move forward 
like this from now on. You will keep me happy and 
I will keep you happy. Wow, they are enjoying here, and everyone at home is worried 
because of them. Alizey, come let’s go somewhere else. No, no, come let’s meet them. No no Alizey, why do you want 
to meet them? Alizey, they are here to enjoy 
their dinner, it doesn’t look nice if we go and 
disturb them for no reason. Look don’t misunderstand 
what I am saying, I am just saying that you know
 Shani very well, how ill-mannered and illiterate he is, I don’t want him to misbehave with you and then I get in any sort of heated 
argument with him. Okay now come on, why are wasting our time standing here? Okay let’s do one thing, we will go sit on the floor upstairs. Hmm. 
Come. uncle was getting worried for no reason, did you see how happy Ramsha was? She was laughing and smiling so much, actually, both of them did this to 
create tension in our house. By the way, Ramsha didn’t misbehave,
Shani did. Whatever, Ramsha ran crying and 
whining after Shani. And what was the need for her to cry
and whine in front of uncle, didn’t you see how happy she was? She was smiling. I have never seen her smiling 
so much in my life. Uncle is worried there and 
she celebrating here. Yes, I saw, why wouldn’t I see? But I feel that more than 
Shani’s misbehavior, you are angry at the fact that 
why was Ramsha happy with Shani. What are you trying to say? I said what I wanted to. I am just saying that why does Ramsha give us 
tension because of herself? By the way, answer one thing honestly, when there was the time to give tension,
you didn’t cause any, now why are you tensed? Anyway, forget that, we have come out to eat 
so your mood can get better, if we have to discuss the same thing 
outside too, then there is no point of coming out. It’s their life, let them live. So when am I stopping her from living? She can do whatever she wants to 
but she shouldn’t create tension in our lives. You just leave it, let’s do one thing, let’s go to the sea-side after finishing food. I have a very important meeting tomorrow, I have to prepare for it as well so we will go home after this. Okay fine, as you wish. You have no fights with the food,
so have food. Greetings. 
Greetings brother. Greetings. How are you? Greetings, I am fine, everything is fine, right? 
What happened? Yes, why? 
What has happened? No, actually you went with brother, so I was tensed that how 
he must have behaved with you. Why are you laughing Ramsha? There is nothing like 
what you are thinking. Everything was absolutely fine. We went to a nice restaurant 
and had nice food, and then came back, 
in front of you, everything was fine, 
nothing happened. Are you sure? Yes, why would I lie?
 Come sit. Ramsha, your prayers are being 
answered, brother’s heart is changing for you. I hope that’s how it is. Wait a minute, 
your prayers are being answered, do one thing, pray that God, please God, dad agrees to let me 
study further. Pray. Okay Annie, I will pray for you. Okay fi… Now what? Are you doing some recitation ritual? Yes I am. See, I felt that you were doing something, tell me what is it I will do the same. You just listen to your God and He will listen to you. Do you know when a person listens to their God, worships Him, thank Him, God gets close to us as well, not just in this world but everything becomes easy for us 
in the life hereafter as well. By being close to God, people start loving and 
respecting us more. God blesses us with more 
than we can think, that is why start offering prayers, everything will become easy. You are absolutely right, do one thing, wake me up for Fajr too 
when you wake up. I will offer prayers with you and
I will get regular with prayers. You will offer prayers? 
Definitely, I will. Okay then, I will wake you up for Fajr 
from now onwards, hmm? Okay I will go change 
then we will sit and talk. Okay. I spoke to Ramsha. How is Ramsha, brother? She is well, by the grace of God, she sounded satisfied. I got satisfied by talking to her as well. Okay, that’s good. Afsheen, I am not well usually so why don’t you go to 
Ramsha’s house with Afnan? What would they think about us that no one came to meet Ramsha 
after marriage. Yes, brother you are right, you know that Alizey is at office all day so I have to look after the entire house. I have to be after the servants all day 
to get the work done so I don’t get any time from 
such busy schedule. Afsheen, if Alizey has gotten married 
and went to a different house, you must have gone 
to meet her too, right? yes, absolutely. Okay brother, I will go. Don’t keep fried things, 
like bakery items etc. Oh God, brother is fulfilling the relationships 
like she is biological family. Oh God, who will go in 
those narrow streets? Things I do for brother. Ramsha, I am thinking to change the bike, this one is causing a lot of trouble. Even when I was going to the shop 
yesterday, it stopped on way. Should I get a new bike? yes but new bike must be 
so expensive, right Shani? it is expensive but for us, if Mr Qasim buys it for us? Hunh? Where did he come in to 
this conversation from? What difference does it make to him, 
he is so rich, will it be a problem for him 
to get a bike? And why would he give you money 
for a bike, Shani? That’s the thing, he wouldn’t give me the money, 
he will give it to you, look he would never say no to you, 
he considers you his daughter. Are you mad? Have you gone crazy? 
Why would I take money from him? I never even took money from him 
while living in that house, and I will do now. 
Don’t even think. It was different before,
you are married now, responsibilities increase after marriage, 
and expenses increase too. I am your responsibility Shani, 
not his. Why would he give me money? By the way, it is the limit, 
it is the limit, I took you to the restaurant, 
made you eat food, took you for an outing and you cannot even do 
this much for me? Shani? I thought you did all of that 
for my happiness, you were doing all this to get 
your work done by me? okay listen, I don’t want 
to get into all this, you will go to their house tomorrow
and bring money, okay? You have gone absolutely mad, neither I will go to him nor will I ask 
for money from him so you can do whatever you want. Weird… Ramsha, I am telling you, 
you are making me angry now, you know when I get angry 
how dangerous I become.
