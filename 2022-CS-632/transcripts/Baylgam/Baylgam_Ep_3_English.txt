Afnan, you forgot all your manners
and respect completely? I mean, is this how to treat guests
that come to your home? Child, if you had such emotions
for Alizay in your heart, then you should have spoken to me,
to your aunt. Afnan, you shouldn’t have done all this. For me there can be nothing that
will make me happier than I see you and Alizay together. You should have mentioned it to me. Aunt, I know, whatever I did, my method was wrong, but… but I had nothing wrong in my intentions. What…. Okay brother, forgive him. He is a child. I… I guarantee you that he will not
make a mistake in future. You also see that he has said what was in his heart. But Afsheen, you… Okay brother, stop it. You don’t have to scold my child, now. This child is yours. Your love and affection has done this. I mean, what do I say to you aunt
and nephew? That boy Ashar, we will have to go to their home
and apologize to them. What is the needs…
Hey, they are good…. they didn’t deserve such treatment. Man…. Yes! Aunt, thank you so much, you saved my life today. I thought dad is so angry. For the first time in my life,
I will get beaten today. But aunt you are so sweet,
see how you saved me. Okay tell me something, where is the madam for whom
I did all this? Where would she be?
She is in her room. Where else? Meaning, I will have to go in the lion’s cage myself. Aunt, I will go to her. I don’t understand why you say no
to everything I ask you to do? Because I am not your servant
or wife, that’s why. What are you looking at?
I am right. I am not your wife that
I listen to everything you say. Make me tea! Oh God. I don’t know what he thinks of himself. He will do what he wants. Alizay. Alizay. What happened? Why are you sitting with
such a sad face here? I am thinking how I will go
to the office tomorrow? How will I face Ashar? You know I have a solution for this
like every problem. Huh? You do one thing, resign on email. Yes, neither will you have to go to the office, nor will you have to see Ashar’s face. Who asked you? What solution you have found. I should resign. Hey… I found a good solution. Leave my hand. Hey, you will really benefit from listening to me. I said leave my hand. Hey, I won’t leave your hand. I said, leave my hand. I don’t even want to talk to you. You embarrassed me in front of everyone. Ramsha. Ramsha, child. Child, I have washed the clothes
put them on the clothesline on the roof. There is sun on the roof. Your uncle has to wear them in the evening, they will dry quicker. I just came tired from the university. I don’t have the strength to work at all, and I have no strength to go on the roof. Whenever I ask you to do some work,
you never have strength to do any work. You are a lazy girl. Lazy. Poor Ramsha does all the work. She has so much burden on her shoulders. People don’t get it. Hey… Mama, I will quickly go and hang these
clothes on the roof, okay? I will come in two minutes, mama. Okay, then. Sister in law, I had kept a bucket of washed clothes here, where is it? Hey Ramsha took the clothes
to hang them upstairs. She is a weird girl. When I was asking her, she clearly said no. Now she took her herself. Salma, you know that girl. You never know about her mood, she is in one mood in a moment
and in another in the next. Hello. Hello. Afnan. First tell me where were you? I was… I have been calling and messaging you
for so many days, neither are you calling me back,
nor are you replying to my messages. Do you even care about me or not? Hey listen… But why would you care about me? You are always busy. You don’t care about anyone. I am the mad one who is always after you. Oh God, girl. Breath. No, first you tell me… answer all my questions quickly. Hey, I will answer you when you get quiet. Go ahead. Man, I was busy. Oh, you only have this small answer
for all the things I said, that you were busy? Listen, I am not in the habit of
talking so much in one breath. You know that well. I was busy. You know, I have a lot of burden of work. Yes, I am the only idiot who worries
for you all the time and I call and message you so much. Okay fine, I am sorry. Shall we move on? Come on, tell me, what is going on? What are you doing? Nothing at all. I just came from university. You tell me, what is going on? Listen, Ramsha, I will call you back, I have an important call coming in. Bye. Bye. Bye. Afnan. You don’t have time for me at all. Hey Alizay, why didn’t you go to the office today? When have you left me capable
of going in front of Ashar? You know he has been calling me
since morning. I don’t have the courage to
answer my phone. Now I am really thinking that
I email him my resignation. Perfect. You know, for the first time in your life
you have made a good decision. Good decision. that’s why I thought I don’t have
to go to the office, so I came for shopping. Yes, and along with that you dragged me. You know, I had such an important meeting in the office, that I have left and come from just for you. It is the start of love, why do you cry? Wait and watch what happens next. By the way, why have you come
in such a bad mood? What happened to you? If you didn’t want to come,
then you should have said no. Alizay, you know that I don’t like this shopping. I mean, I just came here for you or else I worry going for shopping. Hey get out of one shop,
you go to the second one, from there to third, and then the fourth and you don’t have to get anything. Really? So coming to shop with me,
 you find it annoying and what about
 when I come to shop with you? I never said no to you. Yes, that is true. You always come along with me. You never ignore what I say. You always take care of me. That is why I have thought that why don’t
I marry you? What is it, man? You are already doing this with me,
what will you do after marriage? I mean, the food is kept here for so long and you are not asking me to eat. You made me shop so much,
you have tired me so much, now tell me what is this? Hey, you eat. You first. You eat. Eat it. It smells really good. Yes, that is fine, but what can I say? Yes. Actually, Salma is really
 embarrassed in front of you. She couldn’t muster 
the courage to talk to you, that is why she told me
 to apologize to you. Okay. Okay fine, you apologize to her on our behalf. I will talk to you later. Goodbye. Who were you talking to? I was talking to the wedding planner. She had shown a proposal for Annie, but Annie has high standards. Now Salma was so embarrassed that she didn’t have the courage on
how to talk and say no, that is why she told me to marry them. So I was apologizing to them. Hmm. Should I serve food for you? No, no, I am not hungry right now. Get me a cup of tea. Yes, yes, Anwar had come early,
I was making tea for him. I will bring it for you too. Do one thing, ask your wedding planner to search
for a proposal for your Ramsha. Hey, you snatched the words from my mouth. I too was thinking, I would mention Ramsha to them. Now see, Annie and Ramsha
are of the same age and if girls get married at
the right age, it is fine. I will talk to her. I will bring tea for you. Oh God. Why are mama and papa
 after my marriage? I was living a good life. Now these people will start looking for proposals, then they will get me married,
and make my good life, hell. I won’t let this happen. I am not getting married. I don’t want to get married. All this happened cause of this Annie. That is why you shouldn’t live in a joint family. Here one sister in law starts searching for
a proposal for her daughter, the other one also decides that
she too finds a proposal for her daughter. Because from next year,
there will be no proposals. What will happen? Damn you Annie, I won’t leave you. You will see. I will have to do something. Who do I talk to? Who do I tell… Afnan. I will talk to Afnan. Answer the phone Afnan.
Answer it. This Afnan never answers
the phone at the right time. What do I do now? Oh. Relax Ramsha, what is wrong? You are worrying for no reason. After all, aunt and uncle have been looking for
a proposal for Ramsha for a few years, she has not been married. Oh God, so this means they will
only talk about my proposal for some years, then there will be talks of marriage. Wow Hania, you have so many followers in forty minutes. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Okay, I have some work, I will come. Okay. Bye. I will show you… Hello. What happened? Why were you praising Hania so much? Did you not see Hania’s videos? It was her birthday yesterday, it was so much fun, you cannot imagine. Instagram, Facebook, her birthday has is doing well everywhere. Yes, so? What is the big deal in it. Tomorrow is my birthday
and all of you have to come and you people will see, I will have such a celebration
that the world will see. Then my birthday videos
will be viral everywhere. Okay, we will see. We will also see your birthday tomorrow. Do see it. Bye. Your birthday is on 20th July, right? No, my birthday is tomorrow
and you stay quiet, lower your voice, if someone finds out
then my lie will be caught. And you don’t know all this, so you be quiet and let me manage. Come on. Hello. Hmm. Why did you not go to the office? when have you left me capable
of going to the office? I will have to find another job. Right now I am writing my resignation. You are doing a good thing. You know, you shouldn’t have
gone to such a job. By the way, what is the need for you to do a job? I mean, do you do it for money? Do you need it? What do you mean,
I have no need to do a job. This is my passion, I like working. Whatever. Where is dad? Some people have come from
the mosque, he is sitting with them. Man, I don’t know what happens to dad, he doesn’t listen to me. Whenever I explain something to him,
he doesn’t agree to me. Now what was the need to be attached
to committee of the mosque. There was already so much responsibility
and then on top of that this too. He is wasting his time for no reason. Time is not getting wasted. It is being saved. This time, this small service,
be of help in that world. May God accept it. Okay tell me, did you get the cheque
 deposited in Imam sahib’s account? Yes, yes, dad, absolutely. I had asked the manager and he deposited it. But dad, that… I just wanted to ask that his expenses are met with the mosque welfare fund, then I don’t understand giving Imam sahib
his salary from your personal account. Not a lot of money is gathered in
the mosque’s fund, child. People spend millions on their homes, but, even giving thousands to
the mosque seem a lot. The imam sahib doesn’t have a high salary, I have an idea. I know. That is why I give some money
from my account, it is just that. Okay? Yes, dad. Could you not have told me
that dad is coming? Hey, how would I know
I was writing my resignation. You are just taking revenge for this. Serves you right. Hey, you don’t drive me mad, and oh God, why is this water not boiling, I have to boil the rice. What has happened to the gas? Now you go from here, for God’s sake, I have to send food to your father.
Shani must be on this way. Mama, this is the limit, you are worried about the food and gas? I have to celebrate my birthday
and I need money for that. Tell me something have we never celebrated your birthday? We have, right? Hey, your father brings cake. And tell me that there are
several months to your birthday, why do you already need money? You are right, the birthday celebrates for me is grand. The small cakes he brings,
then you make small pieces of it, and distribute it in the entire family
like poor and oppressed people, is not called a celebration. I will show you how to celebrate a birthday, and I will celebrate it in such a way
that it will go viral on Tik Tok. Listen to me, I don’t have money to waste for
this stupid Tik Tok of yours. You won’t get money. And yes, leave, go and give me the yogurt
from the fridge as you leave. Go. Mama, now you are talking about the yogurt. I am telling you I have to celebrate my birthday, you are talking about yogurt,
some times gas, then something else. You give me money right now,
so that I leave from here. I told you, you won’t get money, so you won’t get money, that’s it. Mama, give me the money,
what is wrong? Don’t you dare ask your father for money. Hey, he works so hard and that’s
when he earns money and this money of his is not
for your useless work. it is not useless, it is my birthday. Hey, bring me the yogurt! I am not bringing yogurt. Oh God. Aunt. What are you doing here? Mama had sent me for some work. What happened? What do you want? By the way, what are you doing here? Go and get ready, you have to
go out with me somewhere. Where are we going? Annie, you are asking too many questions. You will find out where we have to go
when we get there. Right now you go and get ready,
and come to my room. I have to go to mama. Fine.
Go. Dress up well, okay? Ramsha, will you tell me
why we have come here? Walk quietly, you will find out just now. But tell me, if you have brought me,
then why did you bring me? This is the same chain that elder papa
gave you on your birthday last year? Yes Ramsha, what are you going to do?
Why did you bring it here? I brought it to sell it, why else
would I have brought it? Are you out of your mind? You will sell this? If elder papa finds out, then? Who will tell him? Huh? If you keep your mouth shut,
no one will tell him. And after all, this is mine, I am the owner of it. It is up to me, if I sell it, keep it or lose it. And Annie, I am not doing anything wrong. Sit quietly over here, no one should have doubts. Is this your chain? Yes. No, do I look like a thief to you? No madam, I didn’t mean that. You weigh it quickly and tell me,
how much is it worth. Fine, I will tell you. I don’t know what he thinks of himself. Ramsha, what are you doing? What will you get out of selling this? Money, what else? Have you forgotten, mama always says that
the gold is for bad times. So when a person is going through bad times, then sell this gold and earn money. So when are your children dying of hunger that you have to sell this
and fulfill their needs. Sit quietly. I have to celebrate my birthday. If mama and papa are not giving me money, then I will have to do something like this. After all, I will celebrate such a birthday that
the world will watch. My videos will go viral everywhere. I will have a better celebration than Hania. You just wait and watch Miss Annie. Madam, for this we can… If elder mama or elder papa ask you where is the jewellery set,
what will you say? This is my issue, you don’t worry too much. How does everything become
so easy for you? What are you? All of you will find out soon
what I am. So you be quiet and don’t worry. After all, did you see the grand video
Hania made for her birthday party. You need even more money to
make a better video than that. So you have to do all this. By the way, Annie, I was thinking, we will make the birthday video. Why don’t we spend this money to make a video? Good idea. Hold it. Hold it. Quickly hold it. I will bring the ring light. I will keep it here, okay? And here, I have kept the phone. Now you stand up quickly. I will put up the phone here,
and I will walk from there. Get up, Annie. I will come walking from here so you have to shower the money
from behind me, okay? Have you gone mad? Who does this? Hey… What no one does, we will do it. After all, to make a good video
you need to do something unique. If there will be something different
then people will watch it, that’s when we will get views,
that’s when we will get likes. You don’t get likes just like that. I will turn on the ring light. If someone sees this money, then? How would anyone know? Mama and aunt are sleeping anyway, Shani, uncle and papa are at the shop. The two of us are here. Who else
will watch it other than us? No one, right? So be quiet, and stand here
and shower the money, okay? Fan, where is the fan? Yes, it is here. Now, why are you picking up the fan? Man, see, when I put the fan on
the sofa over there, then my hair will fly, and when you shower the money, it will be blown away even better,
the video will be much better with this. Come on. Come on. Come on. Ready? Come on stand here quickly
and shower the money like this, okay? Okay. One, two, three. Okay. Should I throw it? Yes. What is going on? You people are not at peace
so late at night even? Aunt. You were sleeping. How did you wake up? So I was sleeping, I was not dead. This  money? Where did all this
money come from? Hey, this money, aunt. Aunt, this money. Annie. Tell your mama that this money… I got it from my Tik Toker friend
to make a video. These are all fake notes. Hey aunt, this is the thing about these notes. They look so real when making the video,
that you cannot imagine. You know I too had seen them
making a video too. The notes look really real.
Absolutely. Annie, come on, come and sleep quickly. It is late at night. Yes, mama. Come on. Annie, bye. We will make the video tomorrow. Okay? Goodnight. Goodnight, aunt. Ramsha, what is the name you have put up? Ramsha Sajid. Such names don’t work on social media. You do one thing, you name yourself… yes, Ramsha Khan. Does the name make a difference? It makes a lot of difference. These Khans are really famous
on social media from the start. Now look at me. Hania Khan. There is an attraction in the name. You are right. Yes. Think about what I said. And right now I have to do something small, I will go do it and come.
Okay. Okay. Bye. Here you go. Annie, you took so long. Hey, there was so much rush in the canteen.
I was getting so angry. You do nothing yourself. You make me do the work at home
and here as well. Lazy bum. Ramsha, today is your birthday, right? Yes.
So what is the plan? Yes, today is my birthday, all of you are invited, okay? I will send the location on Whatsapp in a while, so all of you come, okay? Okay. Bye. Bye. What? Ramsha, are you really planning
on celebrating your birthday? Yes, so what else? I am not mad that I sold my gold chain. Obviously, I have to celebrate my birthday and I will celebrate a birthday better than Hania, you just wait and watch. Come on, man, we are already late. Come on. We will eat… hold this. We will eat something and then
we will go for the class. Come on.
I have to hold this as well. Yes, you have to. So Fahad is the party even interested or not? Man, I feel that the party is interested. Okay, if they are interested, then fine, I will talk to dad, we will make a deal with them. So talk to him, where is uncle? Man, he went to another city
with a religious congregation. He will be back tonight. Oh man, she will not let me work peacefully. Who is it? Hello. It has become my unfulfilled desire that
Mr. Afnan picks my call on the first bell. I am talking to you, do you hear me? Yes. Yes, I hear you. You know, today is my birthday. Oh, okay. Happy birthday. Hey, just happy birthday won’t work. Today you will have to come to
the party in the evening, I am quickly sending you
the location, you come there soon, okay? I will try. Hey, Afnan, see, I know that you are really busy, you don’t have time at all. You have a lot of work to do, but no work should be more important
for you than me. You are coming in the evening, okay? Okay fine, then you send me the location I will come over, okay? Are you sure? You will come, right?
I will wait for you. Okay bye. Goodbye. Who was she? Party. What? What? Who was she? Hey, man it was not that important a person
that I tell you who she was. Tell me about the party,
what do we have to do? Or else I won’t talk to dad. If you are not interested then, it is possible… What do we have to do about the party? Let me work on the details for it, please. No, no, no, no, I cannot be part of any plan of yours.
No, Ramsha. Man, Annie, come on. I promise you no one will find out anything. We will have a lot of fun. Please, come on. How can you say that no one will find out? If someone finds out, then we will be in trouble
and brother will choke me to death. It is not as easy as you think it is, Ramsha. I would say you too don’t do it. Annie, I am telling you nothing will happen. You know, I have booked the hotel
by paying so much money. What do you want that
all my money goes to waste? Oh God, who had told you to give the money? If you don’t want to go, then don’t. What do you think I cannot
do anything without you? Yes. You think that. I don’t need anyone,
not even you, understand? Fine. May God guide you and also
put some sense in you as well. I don’t care. I don’t know what they think of themselves. I am enough. Here you go. Oh, today there was a lot of work,
I got tired. There was a lot of rush. Anwar too went for some work,
I had to take care of all the work. Why? Where was Shani? He went to the warehouse for cleaning. We are getting new stock,
we had to make room for that too. Greetings. How are you, papa? I am fine, child. You tell me. I am fine. Okay mama, I will get late on my way
back from the coaching. My friend, Savera, her mother is unwell,
so I have to take her to the hospital. Hey, why will you take her mother to the hospital? She will take her, herself. Hey mama, what is wrong with you? You people know her mother is handicapped. How will that poor thing take care
of her mother alone? So it is necessary for me to go. So, she will have a father, ask him. Her brother must be there,
why do you have to go along? Hey mama, she has no one in this world. No sister, no brother, no relative. She only has a father,
who too is in Dubai. Now tell me, how will
she manage all this alone? Papa if I do a good deed, then it will be good,
make mama understand this. Hey let her go. She is going to do something good,
God will be happy. Go child. Okay fine, tell me, till when will you come back? As soon as my work… I mean, as soon as the work in
the hospital will get done, I will come immediately. Okay, come soon. Okay. Goodbye. Bye. What have you cooked today? Yes, I made spinach meat. Serve food, I am hungry. I will just serve it. Hi everyone, this is me Ramsha Khan, and today is my birthday party and here are all my friends. Everyone say hello quickly. Hi. Through this video, all of you can
be part of my happiness. Don’t forget to wish me. Bye. Come on, now all of us will
take picture. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Everyone come behind me. Come on. Come on. Ready? Yay. Ramsha is not back yet? Why did you give her permission
to go to her friend? Salma, it was a good deed,
how could I say no? Although, I had asked Ramsha
to come back soon. I don’t know if that girl’s mother’s
health is fine or not? God be kind, what if she has
got really unwell. So, you do one thing, call and find out. That’s the issue. I have been calling her for so long,
she is not answering my phone. Hey Annie, child, you do one thing, that you call Ramsha’s friend, and ask them if they came home
from the hospital or not, and how is that girl’s mother is like. Call her, child. Annie, what is your elder mama asking you to do? Elder mama, I don’t have her friend’s number. Okay tell me, why did you not go to coaching today? I didn’t have a class today. I am in group A, and there
was a test for Group B. Ramsha is in group B, so she went. I am surprised. Her father got the admission done together so that both sisters will come and go together. I don’t know what drama these
coaching people of yours have started. A, B, C, D. Sister in law, don’t worry, she will come. Come on. Come on. Come. She will come. She will come. Oh man, Afnan, answer the call. You are already really late. You always do this. Ramsha.
Yes? How much longer will it take? Cut the cake. I am getting calls from home
again and again, I have to go. You know, I too am getting
calls from home, but… Then who are you waiting for? Ramsha.
Yes? Come on, it is late, let’s cut the cake. Come on. Come on. Come on, man. Come on. Come on. Come on. Everyone come, we will cut the cake. I will light it. Okay, ready? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday Ramsha. Happy birthday to you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Ramsha. Ramsha. Ramsha. It is not there. Come on, let’s take pictures. Sister in law, didn’t Ramsha come yet? No Salma, she has not come yet.
I am really worried. I am calling her, this girl is not
answering my phone. It is really late right now. Where did she go right now? Hey, son, Shani, she went to coaching and then she was saying
she would go to her friend’s home on her way back, because her mother is not well,
she has to take her to the hospital. Child, you do one thing,
that you go to Savera’s home and find out if Ramsha has
come from the hospital or not? Fine, I will go. I will find out, you don’t worry. You come with me. I don’t know where Savera lives. Why? Why don’t you know? You have gone to Savera’s home
several times with Ramsha. Not several times, mama. I just went a couple of times and Savera’s home is on the inside, you have to go through different lanes, I get lost every time I go.
I don’t remember, where will I take brother? You just stay stupid forever or else a person learns the way going once or twice. Okay mama, one second. You come with me, I will find out. Yes, yes, child, you go with him. Shani knows everyone there,
he will find out their address. Go child. Oh God, it is really late now. Sister in law, don’t worry. Shani has gone. You sit down. Leave it. Come on. This girl…
Sit. Sit. Man…
Are we late? We are really late, man. I don know… Hello. Hey, you? You came really soon. Right now, no one has come.
Why did you come so soon? Traffic. Traffic. You know the traffic of Karachi well. Even if a person leaves on time,
still they get stuck somewhere and get late, like me. You don’t believe? Then you ask Fahad. Speak up Fahad. Fahad will tell you. Fahad will tell you and Fahad is my best friend. And you know what Fahad’s
quality is? You know, Fahad never lies, he always
speaks the truth, right Fahad? Fahad, this is Ramsha, and today is Ramsha’s birthday. Happy birthday Ramsha. Thank you. I wanted to introduce you to
all my friends, you are so late. Hey, we will meet them some other day,
what is wrong? Right now, introduce me to your
family where are they? Or did you not invite them too? Family? I will keep a separate party with my family. This was just with friends.
Okay. Yes. Okay, come on, I will show you
the videos of the birthday party. Come on. Oh videos. Yes, yes. Come on. Come on.
I will come in a bit. Come on.
A bit? You enjoy. Hey, stay. Okay, come on. Where is her home? Annie, tell me something, you have brought me to this
street for the third time, where is it? Brother, I think it is the street
in front or the back street. I don’t understand. I mean, some landmark?
You must know something. I think it is next to the flower shop. We have passed from there twice. Then maybe it is in the street in front. Meaning, you think I am mad that I will go to every home and ring
the bell and ask if Ramsha is there or not? I had told you I don’t remember
the home well. After all, it is getting dark,
how would I know? Let’s go back home. I shouldn’t have brought you along, you wasted my time. Sit.
