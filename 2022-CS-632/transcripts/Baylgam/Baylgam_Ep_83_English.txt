Yes Madam Ramsha? Tabassum, you didn’t clean 
Uncle’s room today? Whose room, madam Ramsha? Uncle’s room. Both of you listen to me, from today onwards, Uncle’s room will be cleaned 
every day, everything will be placed 
at its place. And brother Bashir you, you will clean everything and 
do the dusting. This room will remain like it was, both of you have to take care of this. Okay, sure. 
Okay, sure. No Afnan, because of him, my brother left me,
I won’t leave her. Aunt, Aunt please. 
Mom. Everyone is watching, 
why are you putting up a show? If it was for me, I would have given her
 to the police. It is my generosity that I am not saying 
anything to her. Afnan, how can you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this house? Tell me. Get her out of this house. Mom. 
Aunt, get back to your senses! You are not providing peace to 
Dad’s soul by doing all this, you are causing him pain instead. What are you doing in 
my Dad’s room? I was missing Uncle, 
so I came here. You miss Dad? Have you forgotten? That if my very much alive Dad 
is no longer in this world, it is because of you. All this has happened because of you, when I look at you, I get blood in my eyes, I feel like that murderer of 
my Dad is standing here. I feel like killing you, give you as much pain as you gave 
to my Dad every moment and send you out of this world, I want to strangle you to death. Okay so then strangle me and kill me so it can end the pain 
for both of us because your words are killing me 
every moment, Afnan, you just kill me once 
so I can be at peace and you can be at peace too, 
kill me, kill me. Afnan, I am handing over Ramsha to you, Have fear of God when it comes 
to that girl, If God forbid something happens to her, I will hold you responsible on 
the day of judgment. You go away from here, go away, I am afraid that I might do something out of anger that might make me regret once again. I wish, I wish you were able to do that but sadly like every time you will be
very late this too. Listen to me, Afnan is not home right now, it is better that you leave 
this home and go, if you won’t go, I will hold your hand and drag you 
out of this house and trust me, no one in this house can stop me. What will you do to get me 
out of this house? I am leaving this house myself, not just because you want me to leave but because I don’t want to live
 in this house. Lower your tome when you talk to me. I guess you are forgetting 
your value in this house. I guess you are forgetting that if I tell the truth 
in front of everyone and I tell everyone your reality then your value in this house 
will be degraded. Ramsha! Control your tongue and your hand else I will forget that you are 
the sister of my guardian. If I am respecting you today 
it is just because of Uncle, else you don’t deserve to be respected. Even after so much has happened, 
this girl’s ego hasn’t broken. How dare she misbehave with you? I won’t spare her. 
Listen, leave it for now. She is already leaving and I don’t want any show 
before she leaves. Oh so you are here, very good. It is good that you are leaving 
this house yourself, else you would have been more humiliated 
had we held your hand and dragged you out. You will be the one getting 
humiliated now and that too very soon. When I will prove you as a culprit, only then the allegation put on me 
will wash away and you guys won’t be able to save 
yourself from the drops of it. I am leaving this house, I am leaving this house, Alizeh but I will definitely come back 
to this house and prove that the trust and 
belief Uncle had on me, I never broke it. The attempt you and your mother 
made to prove me characterless, I will prove it wrong at any cost, and I am not responsible 
for Uncle’s death but both of you are,
I will definitely prove that. That will never happen, Ramsha. That will happen for sure, I have full faith in my God. I don’t know when, how and 
where will he prove it but just wait and watch God will 
definitely prove I am innocent. Ramsha, where are you going? I am leaving this house. Leave it, you are not going anywhere. Afnan. 
You won’t go anywhere. Come back inside. 
Afnan, what is wrong with you? I am telling you to come back inside. Why are you forcing me, Afnan, 
give me my bag here. You are not going anywhere 
from here. Why are you forcing me? 
Why can’t I go? What do you think you will come here 
whenever you want and leave when you want? And I will beg you to stay when 
you will talk about leaving, that please don’t leave my house, 
please. I don’t even expect that 
from you Afnan. That’s great, you shouldn’t! Give me my bag. I am telling you, you are not going 
to go anywhere. Why are you forcing me Afnan? I am forcing you. I am forcing you the same way 
Dad forced me a long time ago, and it is the same forceful promise that Dad made me do that 
I won’t let you go anywhere from here. You cannot prison me in this house 
like prisoners. If you really like to give orders 
then give it to your wife, not me. You won’t step out of here 
without my permission, you will live here, now consider this forcing 
or anything else, this is my final decision. And both of you also listen to me
very carefully, Ramsha will live in this house now,
she will live here, she won’t go anywhere, this is her house too now. Afnan, what is all this? if Ramsha wants to leave this house,
then let her go, why have you disturbed yourself 
and this house because of that girl? Afnan, can’t you see that since the day that girl came 
to this house, nothing is going right? I suggest that you drag her 
out of this house. I cannot do this, Aunt, my hands are tied. My hands are tied to the promise Dad made me do before leaving. He gave me the responsibility that I will always take care of Ramsha. You make Alizeh understand, I cannot break the promise 
I made to Dad. Greetings. 
Greetings. Sit down. Sir, you didn’t come to office today? I waited for you for so long 
at the office, actually, your signature was very much 
needed on this file, that is why the manager sent me
 to your home. Give it to me. Sir, are you well? Yes, I am, why? Sir, you never sign the documents 
without reading, that is why I am asking. You signed without reading today. Whatever I do is not your problem, mind your own business. Okay sir. Listen? Yes, sir? Are you married? Umm, No sir. Why? Sir, you know my income and 
the inflation nowadays, my own survival becomes 
very difficult in it, Sir not just the boy’s family but the girl’s family’s demands have 
also increased a lot these days. Now in this situation who will marry someone with 
an ordinary job. If I tell you there is this girl that 
I can get you married to, will you marry her? What sir? I want you to marry Ramsha. What? Madam Ramsha? The one whom sir made his daughter. Yes, her. Afnan, take food, 
it is getting cold. Afnan? The food is getting cold, have it. What is it? You look worried to me. You can share with me 
if there is anything. No, there is nothing. Hey? What is it? Afnan looks worried to me, I have noticed he is always thinking 
something, I am sure that he must have discussed
something with you. No, mom, If I would know 
I would have definitely told you. What kind of a wife are you, Alizeh? You don’t know anything 
what your husband is thinking, what is going on in his heart? 
Why is he worried, show some interest. So what should I do mom? If Afnan doesn’t want to share 
anything with me, what is my fault in it? Why are you blaming me for it? Because you are his wife and still you guys have so much 
distances in between, because you never took interest, you just care about your career, 
your lifestyle, you just focus on yourself. Have you ever focused 
on your husband? Because you don’t care. Why do you drag my career 
in everything? If he doesn’t want to share it 
with me, what can I do? You tell me? At least let me eat in peace. In fact, just forget it. Umm, Ramsha I have spoken 
to Adeel in detail. He is ready to marry you. And don’t worry, I have investigated completely 
about him, he is a very noble boy, he does not have any bad habits. You will be very happy 
if you marry him. Who gave you the right to 
take my life decisions? How can you even think 
I will do as you say? I am not doing all this myself, Ramsha, my dad who was dying, 
give your responsibility to me. Enough Afnan, I am tired of hearing
this from you, Afnan, from now on I am setting 
you free from my responsibility, For God’s sake, you set me free too. I should set you free? You? Who doesn’t even know 
how to use her freedom, who always misuses her freedom? Listen Afnan, stop interfering in my life matters. Let me live my life by my choice, I would be very grateful to you. I don’t like interfering in 
your life matters, but you don’t even know
 how to live your life, Ramsha, when do you even know 
how to take right decision, had you taken right decisions, my dad would have been 
alive today. You killed my father. Had you properly lived your life, you wouldn’t be here 
but at your own home. My Dad would have been alive today and I wouldn’t have so much hate 
for you today. Oh God, hope everything is right. Mom? What was this noise? I don’t know, something broke. Come let’s check. You have put me and yourself, both of us in a test, all of this wouldn’t have happened today. Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha, listen to me, stop. I am taking the guarantee of that boy, what is the problem then? And look if you don’t want 
to marry Adeel, and you have someone else that 
you like then answer me. Why are you standing here 
like a statue, answer me. Afnan is asking you something, answer. Alizeh, take her away from here, 
Afnan will keep on getting angrier if she keeps on standing here. 
Take her away. Come, Ramsha. Ramsha, if you live in 
this house anymore, we all will go mad. You have made Mom a blood pressure
patient already, and Afnan, he is getting unwell because of you 
day by day. What do you want from all of us, 
after all? For God’s sake,
 stop crying. You are so stubborn. Uncle left the world because of you. What do you want? We all should die 
because of you as well? You don’t care at all. You are such a selfish girl. Listen? I want to talk to you. Say it. I am ready to listen to you but I have one condition. For a moment I thought you are 
concerned that I am worried, that is why you are listening to me. It’s good that you cleared my misunderstanding
in a few moments. Aunt is right, for girls like you, relationships don’t matter but conditions are important, anyway, what do you need now? 
Tell me about your condition. You will never interfere in my life
after I leave this house. After my marriage, the commitment you made 
to Uncle will be fulfilled, you will have to promise me, Afnan. No matter whatever happens, whatever happens, whether I live or die, no matter 
what situation I am in, you will never see my face and will never show me your face. If you agree to all this, I will also agree to what you said. I am ready to get married. When do you even know 
how to take right decision, had you taken right decisions, my dad would have been alive today. You killed my father. Had you properly lived your life, you wouldn’t be here 
but at your own home. My Dad would have been alive today and I wouldn’t have so much hate 
for you today.
