Alizeh Child, Ramsha needs a friend
right now and you are of her age, be her friend! Girls talk with their friends
with open hearts, which they may not be able
to do with everyone else. Look if she shares with you
what’s in her heart, then her heart will feel
less burdened. She has closed herself in her
room since her mother’s death, she has lost her spark,
she has become so quiet! Uncle you are right, I often see her crying only! If I speak the truth, I feel sympathy for her. That’s it, child! The loss of a mother is so painful. Maybe Ramsha was attached
to her mother just like I am! I cannot imagine
my life without Mama. If I ever come back from the
office and she is not home, I feel suffocated, the house feels empty without her I have a friend, he has a Punjabi poet “The house which has no mother, has no safety or warmth”. There are blessings in
the house due to mother, she is the one who stands by you! A person can at least vent
his feelings to his mother, A mother is the biggest support, there is no… we can at least share it! Greetings Hello child, come, sit child, sit, sit with Alizeh, sit! Talk to her, she makes friends quickly Uncle, I don’t feel like
talking to anyone, I just want to sleep all the time and go into a deep sleep, meet my mother in my dreams and that meeting never ends! May Allah give you life, may Allah (swt) give you patience, it is really hard to maintain patience, and that is why Allah (swt)
has kept a big reward for it! But Allah (swt) is always
with the ones who are patient Alizeh, you didn’t get ready? Are we not going?’ Oh, sorry, I forgot Are you guys going somewhere? Yes Dad, we are going for our
wedding shopping. That is a good thing, why don’t you guys do one thing, take Ramsha along with you. Since she came into this house, she never left, if she goes outside,
she will feel better. Yes, Uncle is right, you should come with us, and we will have dinner as well, hmm? But dad…. No, Alizeh you guys should go, I will go some other time,
not right now. Are you saying no because of Afnan? Don’t worry about him, he is like that, it takes him some time
to socialize with people. Afnan is my son but his nature is different than mine. Come, I am going to get ready,
you should get ready too. She is asking you so nicely,
go child, go! Afnan! Hey! I can’t understand anything, what was the need to take
that girl along with us? Afnan, uncle requested me to do it,
I couldn’t have refused him. Alizeh, this is mine and
your wedding shopping! People don’t take their
relatives or family members and we have to take
that girl along with us! Even if Ramsha comes with us, what issue do you have? I cannot tolerate her coming
in between you and me! I mean I cannot tolerate her coming
in between our shopping spree, what will she do there? Afnan, even I don’t want
anyone to come in between us but if Ramsha goes with us, nothing will happen! And look, if we don’t take her, then she will say something to uncle, and then you know chaos will be made. Look, fix your mood, what can happen if she
goes with us anyway? I don’t know, as you guys wish, I cannot say anything. Go and bring her now. Go bring her along Afnan, Hmmm what do you think of this dress? I don’t know, I don’t understand women’s
clothing anyway! Ramsha, come here for a minute What is the need to call Ramsha? You are not telling me anything, so I thought I should ask her. Ramsha what do you think about this dress? It’s nice, right? If you were in my place, would you have chosen something
like this dress for your wedding? Alizeh! What is wrong with you?
Are you in your senses? What are you saying to her? What happened Afnan? I am only asking a question, what did I say wrong? Tell me, if you were in my place,
would you have chosen this dress? She could have never
been in your place! And she never will be! Ignore him, you tell me, is this a nice dress? Alizeh, I don’t know what
type of dresses you wear, so do what you feel is best! Ramsha, you tell me, how do you
find this dress to be? Alizeh, I don’t need anything, thank you so much,
I have clothes. Ramsha, you will have
to buy something, uncle ordered me that since we are going shopping so I should buy you a dress
as well of your choice. Tell me, do you like this? No, I don’t want it. Do you want me to be
scolded by my uncle? If you like it then tell me, this colour will look good on you, look! here! Alizeh! yes What are you doing? I chose this dress for you and I have paid for it as well. Afnan, what is this behaviour? She must have felt so hurt
listening to what you said! So, what if she wore this dress? It is good that she heard, she should know that thing one
which only you have the right, she can never have it! Please buy whatever you want,
and come to the counter. Ramsha what do you
think about this dress? It’s nice, right? If you were in my place, would you have chosen something
like this dress for your wedding? She could have never
been in your place! And she never will be! Really? Hmm… Yes, but this is so beautiful, but Afnan tell me something, wait! This phone is so expensive, what was the need to give me this? You should take it back;
I cannot keep it! You will return me the gift? It is your birthday gift when I came to your
birthday party that day, I didn’t bring anything
because I was in a hurry, I didn’t like it and this has amazing video quality, it will come in handy for you! You are right, you know my phone got so old, I was thinking about
getting a new phone and then you gifted me one! How did you come to know? I just come to know everything! I was thinking about making
a lot of TikTok from this and selfies as well. Listen, where did you get these bangles from?
They are really beautiful. glass bangles!... So, what if it is made of glass? At least it looks good! Wow! Who loves glass bangles?
Only you like them. I like bangles on a woman’s hand, but in your hand,
they look special Thank you, from now onwards,
I will wear bangles daily This is your best quality; you listen to everything I say and agree to everything I say! Iqbal is a good advisor, fascinates the heart in moments, He did become hero in talk, but one in deeds he could not be. Though the mosque was
built overnight by the believers, our heart being old sinner
for years devout could not be. Oh, thank you! Afsheen, the kids went shopping, are they not back yet? Brother, you know it
is wedding shopping, it takes time. Alizeh has taken a lot of time, Ramsha is with her as well, the child must be getting worried! Brother, you sent Ramsha
with them for no reason. You know shopping takes time and these people are not
used to of going to malls! They go to the bazaar near
their neighbourhood, and shop for whatever they want… and you know Alizeh takes time when
she is shopping, what if Ramsha gets too tired? Okay, I will talk to Alizeh on the phone. Hello, Yes Alizeh child, all good? Ramsha is fine, right? Okay, okay, you guys enjoy, so when will you return? Okay, you guys’ shop, and yes Alizeh! Buy Ramsha some things
that she likes, okay? Okay, in God’s hand! I said the right thing,
right Afsheen, hmm? Yes, I will leave now brother Okay You guys planned the wedding
and didn’t even tell me, that is so rude! Yes, so what? You went out of the country
and didn’t even call, do you know how sick
mother got behind you? That is why we had to
fix the date so suddenly! What happened to Aunty? How is she feeling now? She is a lot better now,
Thank God! But her blood pressure
got really high at that time, that’s why we had to
decide all of this. This girl… Yes, I told you that
a guest is here of Uncle, this is her! But this is! Fahad, Fahad! Did you see her closely, look at her closely, doesn’t she resemble your cousin, the one that lives in Islamabad? Yes, yes, she looks exactly like Farheen Yes, her name was Farheen. Look, the name just
skipped my mind! Farheen? Maybe, she might resemble, faces to resemble, not a big deal! Yes, they do, okay listen, what are we doing? Fahad wants to drink a
cup of coffee made by you, he was asking for it for a while, so please make a nice
cup of coffee for him, right Fahad? Yes, yes Okay, I’ll make it Hmm… What was this? Shush! What is this girl doing here? Does it mean that the accident
she had with Uncle Qasim’s car, was that all your planning? Have you lost it? Do you think I can plan like this? Listen to me carefully, Me and Ramsha had
any sort of contact or know each other, no one in the house knows this and please Fahad, no one should know about this, otherwise I will be in a lot of trouble! Now sit down. Don’t overreact to things Hello Ramsha… did you recognize me? Of course, how can you forget this face? Will you be my friend? Look Afnan is already
getting married, he will not even think
about you after the wedding! Then what will you do? You will be all alone and bored… that’s why I am asking you to be a friend. Hey, wait!... Move out of my way! I am talking about coming closer, I mean our hearts will come closer
once we are friends and you are pushing me away… look, Ramsha, trust me I will take you on much better
adventures than Afnan! Disgusting human! When did you come? It’s been a while since I came! What happened, all good? Your face looks a bit weird to me… No, no there is nothing like that I brought some dresses for Afnan, come I will show you as well Right now? I am in a bit of a hurry right now, I have to go somewhere… I will come back later.. What do these guys think I am? Am I a stolen good, a free thing that anyone will do anything with me? Am I left to worry about
all these things now? I don’t know what they think of me, just because I don't have parents, doesn't give them the right to take
advantage of my helplessness… I will not let this happen! I will not let this happen at all! I don’t know why they all are
doing these things to me! I will not give up, I will not give up hope! I will give them a good reply… Dad, these are
the girl hostel’s forms about which I talked with you, the manager there is my friend if you agree then this girl can shift there,
this Sunday Brother, Afnan is absolutely right, till when will we keep this girl here? Afsheen, my heart is not ready
to send this girl into the hands of a stranger Dad, what has happened to you? Try to understand what
I am saying… one day that girl has to go, she cannot stay here forever! Then for whom are you
making her stay here? Listen to me Dad, it is not okay for her to stay here… strengthen your heart and believe what I am saying, that girl will be absolutely
safe in the girls’ hostel! yes Brother, absolutely right, And it is not like she will
stay at the hostel alone, you can visit her and I will keep a check
on her by calling her, and the biggest thing, Afnan’s friend over there,
is in charge so he can give us the
update every minute! Afsheen, whatever it is! I cannot hand over the girl to
someone else just like that! I am thinking about marrying her… look, nikkah is the only relation that can provide her with
complete protection… do one thing, find a suitable proposal to marry her… What, me? Yes Afsheen, you can take care of such
responsibility better, look, this way the girl
will be sent to a safe hand! She will go to her home, it will make me feel like I have redeemed my mistakes, okay? Phuppo, Dad is right, if that girl gets married, there won’t be a better
solution than this! What kind of responsibility
br0ther has given me! Where shall I wed this girl? Who will marry this
girl from my circle, I don’t know how to make
brother understand... Sir is doing such a big charity work, he is marrying an orphan,
support-less girl, it has a huge reward! Tabassum, if there is a good proposal from
your relatives then let me know.. Even if the boy works in a factory and has a minimum wage, just let me know… Ma’am, I know some
women who bring proposals, I will talk to them as
well as my Aunt, she also brings proposals… Okay… Phuppo, Hmm where is Aleezay, I have been looking for her
for quite some time but I don’t think she has
come back from the office yet… Phuppo, make her understand, that she should have taken
an off from the office by now otherwise how will we
prepare for the wedding? Hmm… Aleezay took an off from
the office a few days ago… she just went to a
birthday party right now… what was the name? Yes, someone named Salman, she went there… Okay, I will call her... What are you saying? I am absolutely right, Ma’am has asked me to 
look for your proposals, Sir wants you to get married 
as soon as possible. I have so many good proposals... I can tell you a very good one, other than that my aunt 
also brings proposals, she has some good proposals, I have fixed marriages
 before as well and I will find the 
best proposal for this one… This cannot happen, 
I have to talk to Uncle! listen! Ramsha Ma’am! Here look, they have sent the 
details of the rooms, they are big and clean Uncle! Hmm… I cannot marry uncle… You can make me 
the servant of this house, give me a place in 
the servant quarter but don’t force me to get married, I am begging you! I don’t want to get married Uncle… What happened child, who told you that
 we are marrying you off forcefully, why are you so worried 
regarding marriage? sit here, here, 
sit comfortably! Carefully, there is no need to 
cry over this, here, drink some water… good! Here, give me… What happened? How can you think that we will marry you off 
without taking into regard your decision? The nikkah or wedding 
is not possible without the girl’s approval… and you are just like 
my daughter, the way I would ask 
my daughter for approval, the same way I will ask you… what happened? Tell me… what is the reason? Ramsha! What happened? You want to share it with me, okay, let’s talk outside, don’t disturb dad… Tell me… Afnan go outside, the girl must be feeling nervous Dad! What’s wrong? It is good, we can decide other 
things here as well Tell me Ramsha, 
child what is wrong? You don’t need to get worried, okay, I am here… you can talk to me about anything… thank you.. stay alive... Afnan, I don't know
 what happened with this child that she got so worried 
about getting married… may Allah give her 
a blessed future… Hi… When I told you not to go to Salman’s birthday, then why did you go? What happened Afnan? Why are you talking to me like this? I can talk to you however way I want, just answer my question… I told you not to go but you don’t care about me, there is no value of 
mine in front of you! Afnan, please, if you don’t care about 
your respect, at least care for mine, I servant is standing here! You care about the servant… you don’t care about me at all? When I told you not to
 go than why did you go? What are you looking at?
 Go away from here… and you! There are some months
 left in the wedding, get your brain checked Don’t talk rubbish with me!! am asking you the same
 question again and again and you are not answering me, when I told you that you will not go to
 Salman’s birthday than how dare you go there? Urooj invited me, so what if I went there? She is my friend, she would have gotten
 upset with me You care about Urooj’s anger but you don't care if I get mad! Don’t argue with me… I don’t want to argue with you! We are about to get married… and I refused you! Just answer me this when I told you not to go
 then why did you go? What has happened to you? In what tone are you 
talking to me? Whatever tone 
I am talking to you in, why are you not 
answering my question? When I forbid you to go there, then why did you go
 to Salman’s birthday? Why are you repeating 
the same thing again and again… “I told you not to”...
 “I told you not to”, so what if I went there, what can I do now? And tell me will you be doing this 
after marriage as well? Yes, I will do this! And you will have to agree to me, you can do whatever 
you want about it! Okay then… you don't want a wife, 
you want a servant and I cannot become a servant…
 keep this ring to yourself!
