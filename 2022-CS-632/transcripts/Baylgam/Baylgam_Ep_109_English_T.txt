[31.00] Mom, what is this?
[33.48] Actually, Shani’s sister is getting married
[37.80] so Shani is here to get
Ramsha’s jewellery.
[45.72] Oh,
[49.04] by the way, if there was a shortage
of money at your end,
[51.08] you could have just asked Mom.
[62.16] Mom is very generous with
charity for all such things.
[68.12] That is not needed.
[71.80] That’s strange,
[73.32] accepting charity would have been
better than begging.
[83.44] Yes, Alizeh is right by the way
[93.20] and you have made a
huge sacrifice anyway,
[104.20] after all your ex-wife has lived here,
[106.60] and spent time here,
[114.00] so this is your right.
[118.76] You must mind your tongue.
[126.36] I am standing in your house
that doesn’t mean
[128.48] you can say whatever you want to.
[148.88] Hey, what did mom say?
[150.72] She is right,
she is just stating the truth.
[164.04] Now, you guys have married Ramsha
in this house
[166.96] so you can take advantage
out of it, right?
[172.28] Actually, you still haven’t
understood us,
[175.48] we don’t make relationships based
on richness and poverty,
[185.52] we are poor but not shameless.
[188.00] Oh, oh, you are so shameful,
[198.08] you would have been shameful had
you kept your cousin locked in 4 walls
[210.24] instead of leaving her to have an affair
with married men at other people’s homes.
[222.72] What? What are you doing?
[226.04] If you say a word more about
my family,
[229.28] I won’t spare you and would
cut your throat!
[232.44] What? 
What is he doing?
[233.88] I feel like slaughtering her here but
[241.00] I have just stopped my hand
because of Ramsha.
[244.00] Put this down,
it can hurt her.
[251.92] You can take whatever
you want from this house,
[254.08] we won’t say anything
[258.84] but put this down, please.
[261.40] Please.
[285.48] Mom, who is this animal kind of a man?
[287.36] Call the police,
[289.76] don’t let him go.
[496.88] Where is the groom’s family? 
They didn’t come yet.
[498.84] I have just spoken to your Uncle,
[501.00] they will be here anytime, 
he has gone to pick them.
[503.24] Where is Shani?
[504.64] Shani.. Umm,
[507.48] I am Shani’s mother but 
what do you need from Shani?
[520.96] Look, I have an arrest warrant
against Shani.
[529.60] I want to take him.
[531.28] But what has Shani done?
[534.40] Why are you here to arrest him?
What is his crime?
[537.24] Look, you have a function 
going on in your house
[538.96] and I don’t want any chaos 
or forcefulness.
[542.56] Call Shani. Shani?
[544.60] Shani?
[546.52] Who is Shani here?
[562.96] What happened Aunt?
[570.56] Is that Shani?
[580.32] So you are Shani?
[582.00] Yes, I am Shani.
[585.20] I have a warrant against you
[592.40] and I am here to arrest you.
[604.80] What have I done?
[607.16] You know madam Afsheen 
and Alizeh?
[626.48] They have filed 
an FIR against you.
[643.96] FIR for breaking in their house
 and attempting to murder.
[658.72] I am arresting you and 
taking you with me.
[661.16] catch him.
[662.12] No, no, how can you just take him?
[664.36] Let’s go. 
Brother? Brother?
[666.40] Where is your Dad?
[668.44] Quiet. Quiet.
[670.52] Have patience. 
Mom.
[671.88] Annie, Annie, stop. Annie, 
we need to take care of Aunt, stop
[674.20] Hello? Hello? 
Where are you?
[676.64] Quickly come home. 
What is going on?
[678.04] Police have arrested Shani.
[765.44] Afnan, this boy should get 
the strictest punishment.
[785.20] How dare he barge into our house 
and torture us.
[809.40] He has broken everything,
[812.04] thank God that God saved my daughter 
from that monster else
[815.60] he would have killed us.
[830.64] When so much has happened,
[832.20] you should have at least 
called me once.
[850.92] And how did you even let him 
enter home?
[854.28] We didn’t call her,
[856.44] I think your beloved wife sent her.
[867.56] It was all her plan as well.
[897.64] Afnan, if anything happens 
to my child,
[899.64] I will never forgive you.
[916.88] You get him arrested.
[930.20] Afnan,
[931.76] he should get the strictest 
of punishment.
[953.64] Nothing will happen to our child.
[963.56] Don’t you see how scared 
my daughter is.
[997.48] Go away, everyone will see.
[1000.52] Go.
[1002.68] Why are you acting so pious?
[1006.68] Did you forget your past?
[1010.52] I knew it,
[1012.04] I knew very well about 
your shallowness.
[1014.52] Yes, I am shallow, 
you got it right,
[1022.68] and after marriage you will realize 
I am not shallow
[1026.64] I am even pathetic.
[1028.40] I remember each
and everything.
[1032.36] And I will take revenge for each 
and everything.
[1038.60] Is that how you treat your wife?
[1042.44] Whose wife is it? Mine right?
[1045.44] So I don’t understand why you have
so much sympathy for her?
[1053.40] she is my wife,
[1055.40] and I will do what I want.
[1057.72] If she is your wife, 
consider her like one,
[1060.96] stop treating her like animals.
[1068.44] If she doesn’t listen to you 
then explain it to her with love,
[1072.56] locking her in the room is 
not good behavior,
[1077.96] God forbid, if something 
happens to her.
[1080.28] So what?
[1082.96] Maximum what? 
She would have died?
[1086.48] Everyone has to die.
[1095.36] By the way I am both surprised 
and a I feel a bit sad for you,
[1099.76] because I thought 
you are her only lover
[1105.00] but there are more here.
[1106.72] Shut the hell up.
[1110.16] If you said one dirty word 
about Ramsha’s character,
[1113.56] I will pull off your tongue.
[1115.48] And you think I am wearing bangles?
[1118.76] I won’t do anything in return? 
Hey?
[1121.52] For God’s sake Shani, quiet,
go away Shani, Go.
[1125.80] Mom, ask him to leave.
[1127.28] Shut up, I am asking you to leave.
[1129.88] Go away.
[1147.64] Afnan?
[1148.60] If you are here to defend 
your ex-husband,
[1151.92] then don’t even say a word.
[1154.36] How dare he?
[1156.56] How dare he enter my house 
and break things?
[1160.08] Keep a dagger on my wife’s neck 
and try to kill him?
[1164.56] Thank god I wasn’t home,
[1167.12] Alizeh and Aunt just filed an FIR, 
if I was here I would have killed him.
[1172.72] At least listen to me once, Afnan.
[1176.28] Whatever has happened wasn’t 
just Shani’s fault,
[1179.44] he told Uncle himself that 
he came here to get the jewellery,
[1183.80] Aunt and Alizeh provoked him 
so much,
[1185.72] so much so that he took this step.
[1187.44] Come on, please,
[1189.08] don’t tell me these fake stories 
of Shani?
[1192.04] What are you trying to say?
[1193.56] What are you trying to say that 
Alizeh gave her the dagger
[1196.04] and ask him to keep it on my neck?
[1198.60] We know how big of a goon he is
[1200.88] but I am going to take all 
the goon out of him today.
[1203.68] Afnan, you think once yourself,
[1205.68] he has a wedding going on 
in his house,
[1207.00] his sister has her Henna ceremony
 going on,
[1208.24] and he has guests in his house,
[1210.60] why would he pick up this day 
to create this show?
[1213.88] He could have done all this 
some other day,
[1218.92] cool down and think no matter 
how big of an enemy you have,
[1223.00] you wouldn’t at least do this on 
your sister’s wedding day.
[1226.72] I just want that you can take whatever 
legal actions you want to take against Shani,
[1232.60] but just let Annie get married once, 
please.
[1237.80] Ramsha, you…
[1330.60] What?
[1332.04] What are you saying, inspector?
[1335.08] Shani got his bail and
that too so soon?
[1339.44] Inspector, I guess you are forgetting
[1341.68] that he has a case of attempt 
to murder my daughter
[1345.68] and it is not some small case,
[1348.80] you tell me who got him bailed?
[1377.24] Mom.
[1379.04] Where is Afnan?
[1381.60] Rasheeda was telling me he has 
gone out somewhere,
[1392.44] I have been calling him for so long 
that he is not even taking my call.
[1401.56] By the way, why are you asking?
[1404.36] Is there something?
[1407.88] Shani has been bailed.
[1410.16] What?
[1420.40] But mom you were saying 
you have filed such a case
[1423.32] that he will have to suffer 
in prison all his life,
[1432.36] it hasn’t even been one night.
[1436.68] Go and ask this to your husband
[1446.16] because Afnan got him bailed.
[1452.16] Afnan?
[1502.84] What? What are you doing?
[1505.76] If you say a word more 
about my family,
[1509.08] I won’t spare you and would 
cut your throat!
[1512.32] What? What is he doing?
[1513.36] I feel like slaughtering her here
[1517.04] but I have just stopped my hand 
because of Ramsha.
[1519.64] Put this down, it can hurt her.
[1524.96] You can take whatever 
you want from this house,
[1527.20] we won’t say anything
[1529.80] but put this down, please. 
Please.
[1554.88] Alizeh, you are still awake? 
You haven’t slept yet?
[1560.60] When a wife has a husband like you,
[1562.44] how can she sleep peacefully?
[1564.64] What rubbish?
[1567.24] I am absolutely right,
[1575.68] I used to think you are careless 
about me
[1584.04] but turns out 
you are feelingless too.
[1588.44] When was I feelingless now, Alizeh?
[1591.28] If this is not being feelingless 
then what is it?
[1601.44] The person who tried to kill me,
[1604.20] you got him bailed?
[1623.96] Look Alizeh,
[1626.36] I understand your anger
[1628.92] but I was helpless to get 
Shani’s bail.
[1632.40] You were not helpless,
[1634.24] you got him bailed because 
Ramsha asked you to.
[1644.00] Afnan, learn something
from Ramsha,
[1653.24] learn to fulfill relationships 
from her,
[1660.80] Ramsha is better than you who is 
still ready to die for her ex-husband.
[1667.32] Just shut up!
[1687.48] There is no need to be angry at me,
[1689.28] if you want to ask, ask your wife,
[1691.28] ask her why is she dying after Shani.
[1738.32] Did you forget
[1741.68] how cruel and brutal 
you were to Ramsha.
[1745.92] How can you come here 
and tell me today
[1748.20] that I am doing wrong to him 
though you
[1751.32] don’t even know anything
[1753.92] You are right,
[1757.96] what I did to her I am being 
punished for it and regretting
[1763.08] but I want that you don’t repeat 
the same mistake I made.
[1768.28] I am regretting too, Shani,
[1773.24] I regret falling in love with Ramsha.
[1776.88] I regret always protecting her.
[1781.96] I regret making her the honor of this 
house and bringing her into this house,
[1791.60] I have a warrant against you
[1794.68] and I am here to arrest you.
[1801.60] What have I done?
[1803.88] You know madam Afsheen 
and Alizeh?
[1809.32] They have filed 
an FIR against you.
[1818.72] FIR for breaking in their house
[1821.04] and attempting to murder.
[1825.88] I am arresting you and 
taking you with me.
[1828.20] catch him.
[1829.24] No, no, how can you 
just take him?
[1831.28] Let’s go. 
Shani.
[1837.44] Thank God,
[1839.64] that Afnan got you bailed
[1848.52] else we wouldn’t be able 
to face anyone.
[1859.28] We have made Annie’s in laws 
understand after so much difficulty.
[1864.56] By the way who asked you to go
 beg Afnan to get me out of there?
[1868.96] Yeah?
[1876.16] What would have happened 
if I had spent two nights in jail?
[1885.72] It wasn’t the end of the world.
[1888.08] Are you in your senses?
[1889.92] Your sister has her wedding 
after two days
[1899.32] and how would it look that
[1901.92] sister is getting married and 
the police are taking the brother,
[1912.20] do you have any idea
[1913.48] what the hell we were going through,
[1922.16] I thank God that Afnan got you bailed
[1925.88] else your sister’s home would have 
destroyed before even being made,
[1929.44] we are saved from the humiliation.
[1930.72] Enough mom,
[1932.92] there is no need to take 
this useless favor from them.
[1942.52] When I am telling you 
I didn’t do anything wrong
[1945.08] and they were the ones 
who did wrong?
[1946.52] So what was the problem?
[1952.40] They would have taken us 
to the court.
[1954.96] The court would have let me go.
[1963.48] Because I didn’t do anything wrong.
[1970.08] But no, we want to take 
favors from them.
[1972.60] Shut up, Shani.
[1974.28] There are some things, 
if they don’t get done in time,
[1977.76] then it doesn’t matter 
if they get done or not.
[1989.20] And yes, listen,
[1994.64] your Dad has said
[1996.76] you won’t go anywhere out,
[1998.20] he will take care of all 
the outside chores
[2005.64] and you will look after 
the chores inside the house.
[2008.20] What is this, now?
[2009.20] I don’t know,
[2011.12] your Dad told me this, 
so I informed you,
[2014.28] now go argue with him, not me.
[2022.36] Won’t go out?
[2025.32] What strange things are 
they saying?
