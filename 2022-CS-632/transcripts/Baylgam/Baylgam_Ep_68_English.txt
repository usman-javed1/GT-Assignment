You look so pretty, brother will

good makeup on me. You are welcome, but you look so pretty… Ramsha, you are standing here and talking, and I am standing outside
for so long and waiting. You see, she looks so pretty. Look, don’t drive me mad. Come if you want to or I will leave you and go. Come on. How does she look! Come on. Okay, bye. Take care. I will be back in a bit. Bye. Brother is really weird. Hey, Shani, how are you? How are you doing? Asim. Greetings. Did you meet, mama? Yes, I met aunt when I came. Greetings sister in law. Greetings. Did you introduce sister
in law to mama? Yes, yes, I introduced her to aunt and also to elder sister. Okay listen, your cousin had to come
from Dubai, right? Okay, okay, you are talking
about brother Danish. Yes, him. Brother Danish. Introduce me to him. Yes, he is here. I will just bring him. Yes. Hello. Hello. Hey, I cannot hear you. Yes, hello. Shani. Hello. Sister in law, meet him, he is my cousin,
Danish Kamal. Greetings. You are Ramsha, right? Shopping girl, right? I am sorry. I am so sorry. Where are you going? You are banging into people. What happened? Shani, I feel really restless. I feel nauseous, can we go home? Yes, we will go, but first let the function end. Shani, I am not well, I feel restless, please take me home. You were fine a little while back. I have to meet my friends, I have come after so long, what is wrong with you? Yes, you are right, but right now I feel that
I am really dizzy, I have a bad headache. Please take me
home, Shani. Okay, we will go,
let me call aunt and Asim. No Shani. I mean, inform them over call. Let’s go right now, please. I feel really dizzy. Okay fine, come on. I don’t know what the problem is. Hey child, you people came back so soon? Has the function ended? I think it is just 11 pm right now. Mama, I had told you to let me go alone. But no, you cannot see
peace in my life, you sent this tension with me. Hey, what happened?
What happened? Aunt, I was not well, I had a headache, so we came back. Mama, I couldn’t meet anyone there. You married me to a sick wife. This is the limit. I am tired of her. Aunt, I am going to rest for a while. Are you in your senses? Think before you speak. If that poor thing became unwell, then it is not in the hands of a person. What is her fault in this? Yes, yes, mama, it is all my fault, that I married her and I am living in it till now. What do you mean till now? Huh? Hear one thing, clearly, Shani. Don’t even think of anything like that. Understand? Come on, go and rest
in your room. Come on, take those things
and take them. Come on, You are Ramsha, right? Shopping girl, right? How was the wedding? It was good. You look worried. Nothing. Why? Seeing your face,
I can tell you are worried. Did something happen? Yes, I am not well. I will rest and get better. Your picture will be with me
in a frame on that wall. There is a great character
in my serial. In demand. Really? What is the character? This is the issue with you girls. You want that you get
everything really soon. Dress up well. Something that will bring
out your beauty further. The thing is, this is showbiz, here whatever is visible is sold. Sir, I will bring my phone
in two minutes. I will show you something… Hey, leave the phone. We don’t need the phone. The actor shouldn’t have
their phone when working, their focus is lost. You should put all your
focus on their work. Today you are working
in my drama, you are its heroine. Really soon, you will also be a film heroine. Why did you come to this small flat leaving
my big mansion like home? What is the matter, baby? I feel you have gotten into
the habit of running away. Look, this is not a good habit. Leave from here,
when Hania comes… Listen to me. Leave me. Listen to me. One minute. No. Where did he come from? Open the door. Please, open the door. Tabassum, tell the driver to take out the car. Yes, madam. Where are you going? Where do I go at this time, Afnan? So, can you take an off from
the office today? Why? What do you mean by why? Because I want this. Is it not enough that I want this? Afnan, had I done what you wanted, then I wouldn’t have been
able to do anything in life. I would say, leave these things and get ready. You too go to the office. It is getting late. Listen, please. I am saying to you
with so much love, that I want to spend time with you… I want to talk to you about
what is in my heart. I want that both of us stay together
all day long and you… you please stay. Please. Why are you behaving
like a child, Afnan? I have a really important
meeting today. It is necessary for me to go,
or else, I might have stayed. We can surely do one thing, I can try to come early from work, then we will sit comfortably
and talk. Okay? Okay. I am getting late now, I will come, then. Okay bye. You really look beautiful in this dress. Delicate, beautiful, just like the heroine of my drama. Who is calling me? Hello. Greetings. Greetings. How are you sweetheart? Who is this? It is good. It is good. It is good. You can forget me, but I cannot forget you. We are your lovers, your appreciators. This is Danish Kamal. Sorry, wrong number. Okay, wrong number. Wrong number. I went to aunt Rasheeda’s home, Saima was also here. She was really asking about you. If you were with me, they would have been really happy. Girl, I am talking to you. Yes? Where are you lost? You know I have been
noticing for some time, you have been lost for a few days. Okay, thank God, I felt that you people have left this world. What nonsense is this? Yes, so what else do I say mama? I came here from the shop, no one is answering their phone. Hey, I went to aunt Rasheeda’s
home with Annie. They have a signal issue there. You know that, so you should have called on her mobile. Even her phone is off. Why is your phone off? Hello, I am asking you something. Why is your phone off? Why is your phone off? Phone. My phone is out of charging, maybe that’s why it is off. Show me your phone. Huh? Show me your phone. Shani… The battery is full. You say weird things. Here you go. Okay, then maybe
I switched it off by mistake, I touched it. Hey, I don’t know what you are
thinking about nowadays. Okay listen, I had asked you to keep the money
in the cupboard that day, give it to me. I have to take it. Yes. These two keep on fighting. How are you sweetheart? What did you think? You will not answer my phone, you will block my number, you will get rid of me? See, I have reached your doorstep. Where did you get the
address of my home from? If a person has strong will, then they meet the destination. Go from here. What? I said leave from here. No. No. Brother Danish. Greetings. How are you brother? Why are you standing here?
Come inside. Hey, I wanted to come inside, but your wife has an objection, I think. She is not allowing me to come inside. Hey, I don’t think she recognized you. Ramsha, this is Asim’s cousin, who lives in Dubai. No, no, I think she has recognized me she is acting unaware on purpose, right? Hey brother Danish, come inside. Ramsha, make tea. Leave what Shahmeer was telling you. Just listen to what I am saying, okay? Yes, sir. This is better for your future, okay? Yes, fine, sir. and listen, you will get all the luxuries in this home, that you wont even get
in a five star hotel, okay? Let me tell you one thing I really like girls like you. Come on, let’s take a selfie. Come on. Friendship selfie, right? Okay, now tell me,
what will you eat and drink? Nothing, sir. I was saying we are a little late, let’s go home. What is wrong with you? What is wrong? Get used to all these things. You will be a star. A star. No, no, sir, I mean, I feel that I am a little unwell, so I was saying that let’s go home… One minute, what happened to you? No, no, sir. I am just unwell, I don’t have fever. What is wrong with you? You are a lucky girl, who is sitting with me on
this table at this time, or else people long to
take pictures with me. Brother, don’t worry. Let me know when you get your visa. I know a lot of people there, your work will be done. Thank you brother Danish. You have removed all my tension. I was so worried that I am going to a new country, I don’t know the language there. You removed my worry. You turned out to be an angel for me. Hey, don’t call me an angel. I consider you my brother, that is why. Ramsha, serve tea. Brother Danish, I want to show the documents
I submitted. Should I show them to you? Yes, yes, bring them. I will bring them. Wait. Amazing. You are really an actress. A great actor. You are playing the role of a decent,
pure, respectable, wife. I liked this style of yours. By the way, I like you in every way. Why did you come here? When you left I went tired
looking for you. I got tired. And see, where have I met you. Nothing you are thinking is right. I have left that world. I have no relation with that world. I have really changed. You know. You know well the thing that goes far from me, the desire it increases further in me. And you? You are a drug for me. A drug. Stay in your limit. I am not that same Ramsha from
before, understand? I have no interest in you and your field. But I have an interest in you. A lot of interest.
