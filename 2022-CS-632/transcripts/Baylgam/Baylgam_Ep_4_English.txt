You did good that you sent
your friend from there. I had to talk to you about
a lot of things as well. Hey, you could have talked
in front of him too. No, I don’t like talking to you
in front of anyone. By the way, tell me something, where is my gift? Madam, the flowers I got are your gift. This? Yes. I don’t want flowers,
these will die by tomorrow. Oh wow. You know there is something, at times you are really logical. These flowers will die till tomorrow. Then lets do one thing, your gift is due on me. Are you sure? Sure. Okay listen, I will have to go now. You know, I have to pick dad too. You are leaving right now? No, nothing like that is happening, you will sit and talk to me
about a lot of things. Hey, we will continue to talk.
We talk. But I have to pick dad,
he gets upset, it won’t look nice. Fine, go. You don’t care about me at all. This proves that I am not important
for you at all. This is Shani’s cousin. What is she doing here? Really? Look at me. Hey, look at me. Yes? If you were not important for me, then I wouldn’t be here today. Okay. Okay. Stop it. Okay see, the videos for today. Yes, go ahead. Where the hell are you? You know
everyone here is getting so angry. There is a limit to selfishness, man. You don’t care about anyone. Hey, my love, Annie, I am really sorry, you know what happened? Afnan came so late,
I was meeting him so I got late. I will come in a while. To hell with Afnan,
you come home soon. Okay, I am coming.
You wait for ten minutes. Come soon. Okay bye. Okay bye. Hania, I am quickly picking my bag,
changing and coming. You wait here, I am coming
in two minutes. Wait. Come quickly. It is already so late. Greetings. Greetings. Where were you till now? Huh? Do you have any idea? And where is your phone? I have called you a thousand times,
you are not answering your phone. Do you even care about our worry or not? And you don’t care about your father at all
that how worried he would be cause of you. What is wrong, mama? I had told you and papa that
I am going to the hospital. I didn’t go to have fun,
that you are scolding me so much. Really? If I don’t scold you, then
what do I do? Huh? First you made a mistake,
and then you are making noise too. Hey, I feel I shouldn’t have allowed you
to go to the hospital. Papa, look, make mama understand. She is scolding me for so long. Keeping the phone on silent in
the hospital was my helplessness. I went to help someone, I couldn’t leave the work
incomplete and come. Still you should have informed us, child. Me and your mama were so worried here. God knows where all Shani
looked for you and came. Now why did Shani go to look for me? Did I run away from home? I didn’t go to have fun,
I went to the hospital, right? Be quiet, for God’s sake. And don’t you dare 
misbehave like this again. Hey, I told the poor thing search for you. He took Annie to Savera’s 
home to look for you, but Annie forgot where Savera lives. The poor thing had to face so much worry. Oh, I feel Annie has 
become smart living with me. What? What did you say? Speak up. Nothing. You said something.
No, I was just saying I am so sorry, I will not do anything like this
after today. I promise. Nothing like this will happen after today. Papa, I apologize to you too. Please you two forgive me. I promise, I will not do 
anything like this again. Don’t give me a chance to complain again. For sure. Thank you so much. Come on. You know man, you were right, I had a lot of fun there. Hmm. I was seeing that you too 
were enjoying a lot with your friend. Hey thank God man, you called her my friend,
not my girlfriend. Yes, I didn’t say it, but she was considering herself your girlfriend. Man, she has no fault in this. She is an immature girl. Now whether she considers herself
my girlfriend or friend, I don’t have so much time
to make her understand. Hey brother, I have time. Hey, you are Tarzan,
you have time for every girl. Who are you two talking about and laughing? This is something the elders are discussing, children shouldn’t interfere.
You please leave. Yes,  you two are really grown up. I think I will have to complain
to uncle about you. Yes, absolutely right. Actually, I have told dad everything, that is why as a punishment,
dad is going to get me married to a witch. I am leaving, I have to go to
the office in the morning. Goodnight. Hey, what is wrong? Listen to me. Listen to me. What is wrong? What is there to mind. Brother, I will come in two minutes. No, no, it won’t take two minute, I know. It will take an hour. I will leave now. You go ahead. Really?
Yes. Okay, let’s meet tomorrow.
Okay. Okay, take care. Bye.
Bye. Yes, tell me. Why did you call me immediately?
Is all okay? All is not fine. Your cousin, your uncle’s daughter. Ramsha? Yes, yes, the same. I saw her in my restaurant. Maybe she was having a party. It was a birthday party. Her friends were there and also
two boys came later on. You are mistaken, it cannot be her. And listen, don’t say something like this
about my cousin in future, understand? I am speaking the truth, man. She was your cousin. I recognize her well. Oh, Salma, how many times have I told you
to add less sugar in the tea. Oh sorry, I forgot. and you too have less sugar. Okay. Ramsha. Ramsha. Mama, where is Ramsha? I don’t know, son. What happened? What happened? What happened? Listen to me. What happened? What happened to him? I don’t know. Come, let’s see. Come. Come. Come on. 
Come on. Come on. Hearing this I am really happy, Annie. You cannot imagine. You did really good that you
made Shani go around aimlessly. He deserves this. After all, you have become really
smart staying with me. You did well. Good girl. Thank God I saved you. Instead of making fun of
my brother, accept my favour. Yes, yes, yes, yes, you have done me so many favours, that I am being burdened under your favours. I am thinking that I will feed you ice cream
and pay off all your favours? Hmmm. Ice cream, and you? Yes, so? What is in it? Ramsha. Ramsha.
What happened to him? Where did you go yesterday? I am asking you something,
where did you go yesterday? I… I… Talk calmly. I will not talk calmly, tell me, where were you yesterday? Tell me! Lower your voice. After all, I went to my friend’s home yesterday and I informed mama
and went. Come, come and ask her. Come on.
Don’t lie. Yes, yes, Mr. Ashfaq,
I am forwarding you this email. Okay. Okay. Just two minutes. Okay, bye. Afnan, I am hungry. We get a one hour lunch break
and you wasted fifteen minutes from it. If you didn’t want to go to for lunch, then you should have told me,
I would have gone myself. Hey, I am standing here
and working because of you. Now what more do I do than this?
Just give me two minutes, we will go. Afnan, you… Come in. Sir, this required your signature. This? One million? Sir, Sir Qasim got this issued for
some religious school, he wanted to get AC installed there. Fine, leave. Listen. Yes? Is dad in his office? Yes, he is in his room. Fine, you leave. People are fooling uncle well. At times with one name
and at times with another. They take advantage of his simplicity. Anyway, are you coming or not? Just one minute, let me forward this email. I am going, if you want to come, then come. You wait in the car. I am coming. mama, look at Shani. See, he is putting a false allegation on me. I had told you yesterday that
I went to my friend’s home. I had told you, right?
She is lying. She was at the restaurant yesterday, and her friends were not the only ones there, there were two boys with her too. Ask her. Shani, what are you saying? Elder mama, I am not lying. My friend works there, he told me.
He saw everything. What is Shani saying? Mama, he is lying. I had told you that Savera’s mother is unwell and I have to take her to the hospital, then why would I go to the restaurant? And after all, his friend must have seen someone else and he is blaming me for no reason. Ramsha, tell me the truth, what is the matter? papa, I am speaking the truth….
One minute, before you say anything, think well that if this is a lie, then it will be torturous for you
and embarrassment for me. Tell us. Papa, I am speaking the truth. I was with my friend,
I was at her home. I am speaking the truth,
it is not a lie… you should be ashamed, you are lying
so blatantly in front of everyone. Hey, you should be ashamed. You believe your friend and not me? It is something for you to die. You listened to your friend
and put an allegation on me. Hey, so what if I am not your sister, I am your cousin. A cousin is like a sister too. And you people don’t believe me, right? Mama, you come to Savera’s home
with me right now, and ask her yourself. When she will tell you the truth,
then you people will find out. It is good that everyone will find out
what is my respect and worth in the home. Come on. Come with me right now.
No need to go anywhere. A scene has been created in this home, what is the need to go anywhere else
and creating a scene? Shani, you are the limit. It is possible that your friend saw
some other girl and he thought it is Ramsha. My friend…
Enough. That’s it, Shani. That’s it. I don’t want any other scene
created in this home. Had you seen it yourself
it would have been different. Someone else saw it, a friend saw it and you pointed
fingers in your home. Come on, leave. Go to your room. Go. Mehnaz, make Shani understand well that he shouldn’t let his friends interfere
in the matters of my home, or he will see the worst in me. What? What are you staring at me? I didn’t do anything wrong. Come on Annie. I didn’t do anything wrong. Come, Annie. Greetings. How are you brother Tariq? Yes, what? You didn’t get the payment? Really? I will find out. Yes, yes, I will see. May God bless you. Yes. Afnan, I had given the manager
a cheque that he gives it to you. Maybe he forgot. No dad, the manager gave me the cheque,
but I didn’t sign it myself. Why? What is the reason? Why did you not sign? Dad I wanted to talk to you before that. See, you have already done
a lot for the mosque. Things for them to sit on, cooler, you have given them everything of need. But I felt the promise to get an AC installed
in every room is a bit too much. Child, it is really hot. They are young children. If they get this facility, they will be able to focus on
your education much better. Look dad, the one who has
to gain education will do it. And after all, these children
who study in religious schools, maybe they are not in the habit to live in ACs, so maybe it is spoiling their habit. Okay. So your universities also have
ACs installed in them. What do you say? What do you feel that only those who are gaining worldly
knowledge should have this facility? Those who are gaining religious
knowledge, studying in a religious school, they shouldn’t have this facility
of an Air conditioner? Uncle, you know Afnan is right. Look if you want to give money,
do it for something else. This is an added expense. It is a luxury. If it is an additional expense and luxury, then you people also get
the AC removed from your rooms as well. Okay? Because this is an additional expense, that too will be saved
and luxury won’t remain, because we cannot install
in AC in every home. Okay? Remove the ACs from your rooms. Uncle. Dad. Dad. Dad, please listen to me… What is wrong with you two? You have upset brother. And what was the need for you to interfere? You know his nature. Shani, I saw a confidence on Ramsha’s face. Look, your friend can have
a misunderstanding, and if Ramsha was lying for example, then why would she ask sister in law
to come to her friend’s home? Bilal cannot have a misunderstanding, he recognizes her well. It is possible that your friend knows Ramsha, but I am sure that you don’t know your friend. Look Mr. Shani, some boys have the habit like a woman. They are in the habit of setting fire
getting into the homes of people and idiots like you listen to them. What is wrong with you Anwar? How much will you scold Shani? Stop it. Come on, son, I have served food. Come on. I am not hungry. He is a Nawab! I don’t know what do you do. No. No. There was confidence of the girl’s face,
she is not lying. What is the problem? I will call again. I will keep on calling. Hello. Hello Afnan, where…
When I am disconnecting your call again and again, then why are you continuously calling me? A person can be busy,
you should have this much sense. Now you please don’t call me. I will call you back myself, okay? Afnan. Hello? He misbehaved so much,
that too with me? I don’t know what he thinks of himself. Even if you get free after this,
still don’t call me. I don’t want to talk to you. You are the richest
and I am a poor one. On the Day of Judgment, all my secrets will be revealed. In Your sight, I have nothing to hide. The refuge of Mustafa (Prophet Muhammad)
is my only refuge, the refuge of Mustafa in solitude,
the refuge of Mustafa in solitude. Dad, I know you are really upset with me, but…. Dad. Dad, what is this? Why are there tears in your eyes? No, no, they are not cause of you. I know, dad. I know you got really hurt
because of what we said. But you misunderstood what I said. I didn’t mean to say that. I was just trying to say that whatever
you are doing is too much. Afnan, you know when we ask
God for something, we want that he gives us
the best and the most. When the time comes to spend in His way, then we find what we give
and touch a lot. What do you think? If you spend out of what
He has given you, then that will get reduced? God is not dependent on you, we are dependent on him. We desire His blessing. He is rich. If He has blessed you and given you wealth, and has made you from amongst
those who can given. If He had made you someone
who would take, then what could you have done? We should be thankful to that God, that He blessed you with wealth. Spend that wealth in His way and gather good deeds. Afnan, there is a trade of the world, you get the profit for it here, in this world. Try spending in His way, trade with Him. You will get the profit for it in this world
and also in the hereafter. We ask Him in our prayer “Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire”. He is really forgiving. You are absolutely right, dad. It is my fault. I am sorry. Live long. Live long. Annie, I have been looking for you
for so long, you are here. Annie. Annie, I am talking to you. Annie, what is wrong?
Why are you upset? See, I am already in a bad mood
because of Afnan, now don’t spoil my mood
further getting upset with me. You shouldn’t have done this with brother. You were lying and brother became
the liar in front of the entire home. Oh, this is the matter. Huh? Then tell your brother not
to interfere in my matters. When his friend told him,
he should have stayed quiet. He interferes in my matters for
no reason and I say nothing. He had fun now. You never call yourself wrong, right? When I am wrong, I will say it. Now fix your mood and come with me, we will make Tik Tok. Come on. To hell with your TIk Tok and videos. Mama has said that everyone is at home,
so we will make Biryani. You make the spices for
the biryani, I will do the rest. Here we go. It would have been better that
you had stayed upset with me. I am not going to make any biryani. You know, other people go
for an outing on off days. They have food at good restaurants. And then there is our home. Cook biryani, cook curry,
increase your work. I am not doing any work. Fine. Fine. Fine. Do one thing. I will make the biryani, but then you will wash
the remaining dishes and you will also make the tea. I will wash the dishes? Poor thing. I won’t do any work. Even if you get free after this,
still don’t call me. I don’t want to talk to you. Idiot. Are you thinking about me? Yes, obviously. Who else do I have in my life
apart from you? You are the reason of my life. Okay tell me, why did you not go to the office today? Mr. Afnan, what thoughts are you lost in? What is the day today? I don’t know. It is a Sunday. Oh. Okay get up, get fresh. Mama is waiting for you
over breakfast. She has prepared breakfast for you, herself. For me? Yes. Very good. It has been so long that
I have had breakfast aunt made. Did she make fried flat bread? Yes, your favourite. Okay great, you go ahead. I will get fresh and come. I will quickly call Afnan, before someone comes. What is it, Afnan? You never answer my phone. He is really weird. They make me do all the work. I cannot do this work. How do I… Where are mama and Annie? You scared me. I don’t know, it is the 40th day of mourning of
sister Anum’s mother in law, they went there. Okay. You were not there in
the restaurant, right? You go and ask that friend
of yours this, who you believed. Yes. Yes, I feel he had a misunderstanding and I apologize, I should have asked you first. Look Shani, what had to happen,
has happened. Now leave from here
and don’t bother me. Why are you so annoyed of me? Yes, so you too talk to me
like you are annoyed. It feels like you are
an old enemy of mine, and now see, you are being so innocent,
and talking to me so politely, as if you really like me? Hey. Did you come to your senses or should I dry all the clothes on your face? Hey, talk to me with a bit of love
and affection for once. Are your actions such that
I talk to you with love and affection? Talk with love. Go from here, now. You are standing on my head. I will leave. I will. I am going. Hey Afnan, what are you doing? Leave it. This is my work. I will do it. In fact, we have so many servants
at home to work. Hey aunt, so what if
I help you for a change. What book in the world states that no man in the home cannot come in
the kitchen and do any work? I will help my aunt. In fact, today I will feed you
a new recipe made by me. Mama. What is going on? This is what you should actually do, but because you are really busy, I thought I would help my aunt. By the way, what are you doing here, you have nothing to do here. What are you cooking? Me? I was helping my beloved aunt… You have helped out so well,
it is scattered everywhere. I am so sorry aunt. Aunt, save your feet. You might cut yourself with the glass. I will just clean the entire place. I will clean it all. All this happened cause of you.
You came… Because of me? Yes, you shouldn’t have come here. Hey, don’t fight…
You have caused this destruction. Afnan, sir, you were getting
a call from someone on your phone, I took off the phone from
charging and brought it. Who is calling you? Who is so restless to talk to you? Hey, I am a client in my business. Client? Yes, yes, he has been after me
for a long time. He wants to invest. He has bothered me.
I will talk to him and come. I will talk… You go inside, I am coming. Tabassum come here,
a glass broke, pick it up. He just came to cook food. Alizay, now you too learn to cook something. You know how much he enjoys eating. Fine, I will see. See, this glass is broken, pick it up. The biryani is really delicious. Who is it? He has bothered me… Ramsha, switch off your phone at
the time of food. Switch it off. Yes, mama, I have kept it. That’s it. What happened? I am done eating. You ate so soon?
You had just started eating. You were the one insisting that
food should be served. Sit and eat properly. Papa, I ate well, my stomach is full. That’s it, I cannot eat more. See, that’s why her health is like this. When does she eat?
She pecks on it like a bird. Sister in law, I would say
snatch her mobile from her. She doesn’t pay attention to her nutrition because of this phone all the time. Even right now a friend must have called her. Because of this, see,
she left her food and went. Yes, Salma, you are absolutely right. This mobile is a torment. It is a torment. Hey, have this. Alizay, are you going somewhere? Yes, mama, I am going for dinner with Afnan. Will you come along? No, no, you people go. Enjoy. After all, you people
look really good together. I was thinking Alizay,
that I talk to brother. About what? About your engagement with Afnan. I think you two should get engaged now. Yes, mama, you know, I just joined my new job, so I am a little busy right now. Give me some time. I talked about the engagement,
not marriage. Don’t talk to me like this for no reason. mama, what is the hurry you are in? Afnan and I live in the same home, and I am not running away. I am just asking you for some time. I want that first I become strong,
I make my career. And I am sure you go
and talk to uncle about the engagement. He will get after me from
the next day to start the preparation. I will have to do all
the preparation, clothing, shopping. So mama, please don’t
talk about anything right now. It is useless to talk to you. Alizay, are you ready? Just give me two minutes. Hey Alizay, what is wrong? I mean, we are going for dinner, not for our honeymoon,
that you are getting ready so much. I too know that we are not
going for our honeymoon and we are going for dinner. You will see the preparation for
the honeymoon separately. You will see after marriage. Really? What preparation will you make? Should I tell you everything right now? Yes, tell me. By the way, what have you thought? Are we not getting late now? Yes, yes, come on. Come. Come on.
