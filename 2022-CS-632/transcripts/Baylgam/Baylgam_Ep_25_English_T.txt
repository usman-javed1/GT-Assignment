[566.00] excuse
[567.44] me if you are doing so are
[570.48] you troubled it seems by looking at your face
[574.40] that is why I am asking
[576.76] I can understand that you might
[582.12] not want to share your problem with me
[583.72] but dad loves you people very much relieved
[587.88] you are sharing your  Share your problem with me,
[590.48] maybe I can't help you in any way, the
[595.92] fact is that no one has a solution to the problem that I and my entire
[600.08] family are going through,
[608.08] you please share it, what is the problem,
[617.36] what should I tell you,
[622.24] now time has passed, the
[624.88] wedding procession did not come, the wedding
[632.60] procession did not come, I mean how can this happen, this is a
[635.56] very wrong thing, it is not
[638.36] wrong,
[641.40] this is oppression,
[644.68] suddenly we came to know that their son does
[649.48] not want to marry our daughter
[650.88] [Sangeet]
[666.92] [Sangeet]
[668.40] I am really
[671.88] sorry but he cheated you people, you people should take
[675.20] action against
[677.36] him and if I need any help in that, then
[679.68] please tell me, he has
[684.04] cheated you
[687.20] a lot,
[691.80] Allah will do better for now, please allow me a
[696.52] lot
[715.28] [Sangeet]
[717.96] thank you
[722.21] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [
[765.40] Sangeet] I gave the
[780.72] money, I gave the
[784.44] money
[789.63] [Sangeet]
[802.28] yes what's the matter Anan you are fine, yes I am
[806.80] fine
[809.48] but there was a lot of tension there, there was a
[813.96] strange atmosphere, because of that I am getting a little
[817.52] depressed
[820.20] [Sangeet]
[821.60] you think yourself,
[825.08] those people with whom you were getting married turned out to be cheaters
[828.84] Now a middle class father did
[833.68] all this for his daughter in this time of inflation, I
[836.64] wonder what he must be going through,
[839.56] but you have paid the money, so
[841.60] why are you getting tensed, you have paid the money,
[844.56] that is not the issue
[846.44] [sangeet] I was
[849.08] just thinking that that poor
[852.84] girl, her marriage procession did not come, what must she be going through, first of all
[856.72] in the matter of service to the people,
[860.76] you are no less than Mamu Jaan
[863.55] [sangeet], you want to
[866.24] roam around taking the tension of the whole world,
[870.00] leave these things, no Ali, this is not the issue,
[873.20] I was just thinking that
[876.44] why are the people who are innocent getting punished and the ones who are
[879.00] actually guilty must be roaming around freely, what are we
[881.84] engaged in, we
[884.40] Afghans, we should talk about ourselves,
[888.88] since the time we came out, we are carrying the problems of others
[891.80] on our heads, yes you are absolutely
[894.08] right, we should talk about ourselves,
[898.84] then tell me what is the intention,
[902.00] I say, let's elope and get married, we will leave
[905.76] later, I got trapped by getting
[909.48] engaged to you,
[912.24] so the question of elopement and marriage does not arise
[913.92] at all,
[916.24] this is the problem  I am always
[920.36] insecure about you. I am scared that I don't
[923.24] know when Alize will leave me and run away
[925.36] and I will be left alone with my broken heart.
[928.68] [Music]
[932.52] You think I can leave you. I
[934.56] trust myself more than you
[937.42] [Music]
[957.60] You
[960.66] [Music]
[982.56] I have switched off my phone for two-four days.
[984.60] Otherwise people will
[987.88] spoil my mind by asking questions. My head is
[992.00] bursting with pain.
[994.64] Obviously, people will question beyond what has happened.
[1000.00] Whatever it was, Nabeel's mother should
[1003.68] not have created such a ruckus in front of the entire family.
[1006.64] If she did not want to get married,
[1009.56] she should have sat and talked to Sajid Bhai and Bhabhi separately.
[1014.20] Why are you cursing Nabeel's mother?
[1018.48] What is her fault? This Ram created a real drama.
[1022.88] I had told Bhai Sahab not to keep this
[1027.16] girl back, but he did not
[1030.20] listen to me. Earlier the neighbors used to talk, now the
[1033.92] relatives will talk. Whatever was left of our
[1037.52] respect is gone.
[1041.44] What should I do with the food now? There is so much left,
[1044.56] how do I know? I am not able to understand anything.
[1047.28] Distribute the food among the people.  It is
[1050.36] better that someone will eat it than getting spoilt. How will
[1053.16] I share it with them
[1054.99] [Music]
[1058.28] What will the people say about the food? She has no
[1061.60] respect for herself. She also gave us a role along with her. Do
[1064.24] this. Get the food taken away and give it to the orphanage. At
[1073.08] least it is better that someone eat it than getting spoilt.
[1078.40] [Music]
[1099.56] Where has my life come to this? Don't
[1102.16] say anything about my mother. The person who
[1104.48] married me out of love. I have no life without my mother. He doesn't
[1109.08] say anything about the atrocities committed by his mother. Cheating is in your nature.
[1112.60] You belong to no one. Tell everyone,
[1116.60] my mother. Why have you people bent upon making my life a disaster?
[1127.76] Marry her to the person with whom she eloped and save your respect. It will be
[1129.92] much better for you people.
[1132.76] Brother, they must have thought that there is still time.
[1135.04] Put the sins of others on someone else's head.
[1137.32] Now it is obvious that she has run away from home for so many days, so she has
[1140.24] done a lot
[1143.00] [Praise] What must have happened?
[1144.44] Why were you saying to you that
[1147.80] you will marry me.
[1152.24] How did this thought even come to your mind? Tell me, what happened?  Gaya Afnan we
[1156.36] love me, if we don't marry me then
[1158.08] whom will we marry, what happened to
[1160.48] you, if you laughed twice and talked to me then it
[1163.04] means that I will marry you, you did
[1165.96] n't laugh twice and talk to me, you
[1168.48] always took care of me and this is
[1170.48] not friendship, you have worried about me and
[1172.64] saved me from trouble, I have only and only
[1174.92] sympathized with you, I thought that
[1177.88] she is a stupid girl who might
[1179.56] need my guidance and if
[1182.24] I can guide her by making her a good friend and
[1184.48] save her from bad people then this was
[1186.20] not love, it does not mean that I
[1188.52] want to marry you
[1189.25] [sangeet],
[1204.24] this marriage cannot happen
[1205.35] [sangeet]
[1207.84] but but
[1211.36] why, we were the only people who met you for cheating and deceit,
[1220.12] what are you saying, I am right,
[1223.36] hey, you people look like very noble
[1226.88] and simple people and your actions are
[1229.20] like this,
[1230.76] for this runaway girl of yours you
[1234.20] found my own son
[1238.04] [sangeet],
[1246.24] my daughter made a mistake in her innocence, it is nothing like what
[1249.76] you are thinking,
[1252.68] please come here with me  Let's
[1256.84] sit aside and talk, I can't have any conversation with you people now A
[1260.44] person who
[1263.60] lies once, lies again and again later on
[1265.88] You people are not trustworthy
[1268.51] [Music]
[1276.53] [Music]
[1287.04] Stay
[1288.74] [Music]
[1296.40] I had committed a huge mistake, do
[1299.24] n't punish me so badly, it's a
[1300.88] mistake, you are calling your crime a mistake,
[1304.96] with whom did you elope I
[1309.00] say, get her
[1312.32] married to the person with whom she eloped and save your
[1314.68] respect It will be much better
[1316.68] for you people, hey, now I understand
[1320.20] why these people were in a hurry for the marriage,
[1322.32] hey brother, they must have thought that there is still
[1324.88] time, put the sins of others on someone else's head,
[1326.92] now it is obvious that if she has run away from home for so many days, she must have done a
[1329.92] lot, I don't know
[1334.32] how many
[1335.92] things I am not shameless like you people,
[1339.24] if my daughter had gone somewhere, I would
[1341.04] not have allowed her to come back home, I got
[1379.68] betrayed by my lover, I lost my
[1385.96] heart as well, I lost my life as well,
[1391.48] this is what I got
[1399.93] [Music]
[1400.01] [Prashansa]
[1402.69] [Music]
[1406.88] Kosla,
[1412.00] we were the ones who found you for deception and fraud
[1415.00] Hey, you all
[1417.84] look like very noble and simple people, but your
[1420.28] actions are like this
[1422.16] You found my son for this eloped daughter [Music]
[1440.45] [Music]
[1447.92] I am
[1449.80] ready to live as the daughter of your house Aunty, I will
[1451.64] not express any wish, I will do whatever you all
[1453.20] say, but Aunty,
[1455.56] please don't end the relationship, please I am
[1458.76] folding my hands in front of you Aunty, in fact
[1461.28] I am falling at your feet Aunty, please please do
[1464.00] n't end this relationship, my
[1466.24] father has lost his life because of me Aunty, please don't
[1469.36] end the relationship and accept me

[1496.76] Aunty
[1498.24] [Music]
[1522.85] [Praise] [Music] [
[1560.20] Praise]
[1564.48] Look Bhai sahab, why have you lowered your eyes, just
[1568.36] see what kind of clothes your daughter is
[1570.24] wearing, girls from respectable families
[1572.40] wear such clothes,
[1575.52] and if I had known about your daughter's deeds,
[1578.72] I would never have brought this proposal in
[1581.80] front of the whole world  You people have made a drama of
[1586.60] us.
[1588.60] Now I understand why these people were in a
[1591.76] hurry for the marriage. Brother,
[1594.16] they must have thought that there is still time,
[1596.28] put the blame of others on someone else. Now it
[1598.92] is obvious that she has run away from home for so many days, so she has done a
[1601.20] lot
[1602.37] [Music]
[1613.88] Sajid. Hey, you are still sitting here,

[1675.08] asking what happened. You left
[1678.36] no stone unturned in killing your father.
[1681.12] Remember, Ram Shah, if anything happens to my brother,
[1684.80] I will not spare you, I will
[1687.44] kill

[1732.52] Allah, Allah, have mercy on me.
[1735.68] Malik,
[1738.76] go behind me, don't touch me.
[1742.52] You have not left this house,
[1746.24] but I feel that you will take your last breath
[1749.28] only after seeing off the funerals of both of us. Oh
[1756.00] Allah, what mistake did I commit, I have committed a
[1760.52] huge sin.
[1789.52] Sir, you brought this medicine for me. Yes, yes, ok,
[1793.80] Shani, it will work. You have the money, right?
[1803.08] Hey Bhabhi, why did you people come? Sajid Bhai's
[1806.48] health is better now. He has also been shifted to the ward.
[1808.88] No, until I
[1812.12] see Sajid with my own eyes, my heart will
[1814.12] not be at peace. I want to meet Sajid.
[1819.24] Salma, you take Bhabhi and get her to meet Bhai Saheb.
[1824.32] Okay, fine, but the doctor will not allow
[1829.32] two visitors. So, rum, son, you later  I will go
[1832.96] Bhabhi, you come with me,
[1842.16] why have you come? You have come to
[1844.80] meet Abbu ji, you have come to see him, no one
[1852.92] else is responsible for the condition in which my brother has been put today.
[1856.28] You should
[1860.24] also ask her, Allah has given you a daughter,
[1865.84] beware, beware, the one who took my daughter's name with his impure tongue,
[1872.44] my daughter is not like you, then
[1876.28] you should thank Allah that Allah has
[1878.40] not given you a daughter like me
[1879.72] [Music] If you do
[1883.44] n't thank me now, then I do
[1886.20] n't know when you will do it again [

[1918.48] Well,
[1921.24] you know how I am tolerating this girl
[1925.50] [Music] I
[1936.80] am Salma, the thing is that the doctors have clearly
[1941.16] said that both the walls of Bhai sahib are
[1943.76] closed and plastic will have to be done,
[1951.84] yes, then an operation will have to be done, secondly no
[1955.12] one is wanting it, even I know
[1957.40] that an operation will have to be done, but how,
[1962.52] from where will such a huge amount come for the operation
[1965.62] [Music]
[1971.48] Bhai sahib does not have anything, he has already spent all the savings on
[1974.48] his daughter's marriage
[1979.42] [Music]
[1983.64] Look, my brother, I wish that Allah gives
[1987.68] him  You can give me health but it is not in my power to arrange for such a huge amount at once.
[1993.24] Believe me, my brain is
[1995.64] bursting with the thought, my veins are bursting, it seems as if
[1998.08] I should do something before them, I should repent. There is
[2000.36] so much problem at home, do
[2002.28] n't utter such words, when the
[2004.52] situation at home is like this, even words are not good.
[2008.21] [Music]

[2021.32] clearly,

[2031.08] already very worried because of Sajid Bhai's health,
[2033.24] his blood pressure is also high, in such a situation, should
[2037.32] I tell her about the money, Khudana Khalsa,
[2039.28] if something happens to him, then
[2048.20] no, you you, what
[2055.00] else should I think, you tell me, I will think about what you say, if
[2061.36] you have any other solution, if
