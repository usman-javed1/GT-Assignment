[24.52] Tea. 
Yes, keep it.
[26.92] Hmm, give it to me. 
Take it.
[30.36] Aunt, may I go to Uncle’s house?
[39.32] To meet him?
[41.12] Actually, he is not well,
[43.20] I just got to know he is unwell, 
so can I go meet him?
[48.36] You just went there last week
[57.28] and now you are ready to go again.
[64.04] Shani is not home, you may go 
with him once he is back.
[70.04] No, no, my child, go, you must go, 
you can go a hundred times,
[73.80] in fact, give my special regards 
to Mr. Qasim.
[86.08] Tell him that it has been so long 
we haven’t met,
[89.16] I haven’t seen him.
[100.16] He should come to the shop someday,
[102.12] or he can come home and 
we will have food together.
[105.16] Yes, yes, uncle, okay.
[109.36] What did you do?
[111.00] She just went to Brother Qasim’s house 
last week
[113.84] and you gave her permission again.
[115.88] What is wrong with you?
[119.00] The more she goes to Mr. Qasim’s house,
[121.56] it will be beneficial for us.
[128.84] Don’t forget that 60% of the profit 
of my shop
[134.08] comes from those packets that 
Mr. Qasim gets made.
[144.36] Do you understand?
[145.40] It’s good that she will go 
give our regards,
[149.44] Mr. Qasim will then think of us.
[155.60] Hey, the shopkeepers were telling
[158.04] that Mr Qasim has a lot of deal 
with other shopkeepers too.
[166.44] Just think,
[167.68] if we get all those deals, 
we will flourish, yeah?
[174.56] You just see profit in relationships too.
[179.12] Yes, I do and you know why?
[183.16] Why?
[184.20] Because I am not a fool like you.
[187.08] Have tea.
[190.24] And whenever she goes to 
Mr. Qasim’s house,
[192.44] don’t stop her. Let her go.
[518.20] Hello, sweetheart, hello.
[522.04] I don’t have as much free time as you,
[528.48] I am waiting for you in the lobby, 
quickly come downstairs.
[532.92] I know you don’t have time to waste,
[536.12] do one thing come to my room.
[538.72] What?
[542.88] Why would I come in your room, 
Danish Kamal?
[546.16] I am waiting for you in the lobby, 
you come downstairs.
[550.64] Are you scared of me?
[554.00] I am not scared of anyone but God.
[556.84] I know, I know that,
[558.20] I can’t bring everything downstairs 
to the lobby,
[560.56] everyone must be sitting there,
[564.92] come upstairs, I will sit and delete 
everything. Come.
[574.88] When I couldn’t get hold of you 
in my own home, then this is a public place,
[579.44] what harm can I do to you over here. 
Why are you scared?
[582.08] Come.
[591.84] Do you remember the room number?
[600.68] Come.
[818.08] Come in.
[880.28] I…
[887.88] Yes,
[889.80] else what will you do?
[895.52] You are such a disgusting man,
[897.44] do you have any shame left 
in you or not?
[900.12] You told me I should give you 2 million
[902.68] and then you will stop being 
after my life…
[904.00] Your eyes,
[908.04] your eyes are so beautiful,
[926.16] right?
[943.64] I will be back in a minute, 
you sit down.
[945.96] When I am not in the room,
[949.48] I guess you will feel safer.
[958.24] Sit down,
[960.08] I will be right back.
[1015.08] Did Shani come or not?
[1018.72] I don’t get this boy.
[1023.24] Come, come, Prince Charming,
[1026.72] where were you?
[1028.60] You left almost half an hour before me
[1031.20] and I am here but you couldn’t reach,
where were you?
[1035.08] Dad, my bike broke.
[1036.64] Oh,
[1037.84] did your bike break or you didn’t realize 
whilst spending time with your spoiled guy friends
[1043.52] that it had gotten so late, 
that you had to open the shop,
[1046.88] all of them were standing outside.
[1050.04] When will you realize your 
responsibilities?
[1055.72] I went to Wasim on my way,
[1060.52] my visa for Dubai is here, 
I am leaving tomorrow.
[1064.52] What?
[1067.12] Tomorrow?
[1070.08] So soon?
[1072.72] Yes, dad that soon,
[1075.24] I am already tired of listening to you 
all the time.
[1079.48] It’s good now you take care of 
your own business,
[1084.12] I am going to go home and 
pack my things.
[1086.60] That’s okay
[1088.64] that you got your visa soon
[1090.80] but you should have asked Wasim 
to get your tickets of a few days later?
[1095.56] No dad, that’s not how it works.
[1097.96] This is how it happens in all this
[1100.60] and I am not going there alone,
[1102.64] there are 3 to 4 more people, 
I have to look after them as well.
[1104.92] Really?
[1107.44] Okay,
[1109.84] there is stock in the warehouse, 
at least get it filled.
[1115.00] Okay, I will put it there,
you will remember
[1117.96] the kind of son you got,
[1119.56] you are taking full work from him 
even when he is leaving.
[1215.00] Who is it?
[1224.44] Sir has ordered it.
[1299.20] Come here, come here.
[1304.64] Keep these packets here.
[1310.20] Okay and check the rest 
of the things there.
[1323.04] Hello?
[1325.04] How are you?
[1327.48] I cannot talk right now, 
I am a little busy.
[1331.28] Hey at least listen to me,
[1334.16] you are busy with your work, 
you don’t even know
[1337.96] where your beautiful wife is right now.
[1342.28] What are you trying to say?
[1343.56] What will I say?
[1345.36] What I wanted to say, 
what I wanted has been accomplished.
[1356.36] Your beautiful wife is with me right now,
[1360.76] what else will I want?
[1362.48] Shut the hell up.
[1364.44] I was so sure that you will say this
[1366.52] but if you haven’t asked me for proof,
[1368.72] I wouldn’t be ruining my beautiful 
moments here and talking to you.
[1379.96] I am sure you still won’t believe me
[1382.88] that your beautiful wife is with me.
[1397.48] Wait, let me video call you and 
then you will believe it.
[1400.52] Wait a minute, okay, wait a minute.
[1412.88] Hello, how are you?
[1418.64] I wouldn’t have caused you trouble 
had you believed in what I said.
[1431.36] Now if you want to bear the pain 
yourself then what can I do?
[1434.84] Just give me two minutes, 
two minutes,
[1437.08] I will make you meet your beautiful wife.
[1440.88] I will even make you talk to her. 
Okay? Okay.
[1462.88] Ramsha?
[1474.48] That’s it.
[1516.68] Look, enough is enough,
[1520.64] I have been tolerating your drama 
for so long,
[1524.48] take out your laptop right now and 
delete it right here right now else…
[1527.36] Else, what?
[1529.20] You have been continuously saying else,
else ever since you came here,
[1532.00] else, what will you do?
[1533.96] Danish Kamal, I am warning you 
for the one last time
[1536.72] else I will… 
Ramsha, tell me,
[1538.92] else what will you do?
[1540.64] Tell me what will you do?
[1542.92] What will you do?

 Why are you so angry?
[1737.20] I am asking you where is Ramsha?
[1746.20] Son, she has gone to 
Mr. Qasim’s house to meet him.
[1749.64] What happened?

I will give you a tight slap.
[1781.20] What is it, Shani? 
Tell me what is it?
[1787.64] Call Mr. Qasim.
[1797.00] He is not picking up the call.
[1803.72] umm,
[1805.24] okay you call Ramsha.
[1824.48] Give it to me.
[1871.32] Ramsha is not attending the call.
[1874.36] Mom, tell me honestly

[1886.40] Son, I am telling the truth
[1889.08] she has gone to Mr. Qasim’s house 
to meet him,
[1891.92] she informed me before going.
[1893.44] She lied to you that she is going 
to Mr. Qasim’s house, she is…
[1897.24] She is with her lover right now
[1913.00] and I have seen her myself 
on the video call.
[1920.92] What rubbish?
[1925.24] Are you out of your mind? 
What are you saying?
[1927.60] That too in front of your sister, 
don’t you have any shame?
