Hey, I am coming. 
Who is it? They are constantly knocking on the door. They have no manners. 
Hey, stop it. Who is it? Hey, stop. Have patience. Who is it? Is this Ramsha’s home?
Is this Ramsha’s home? Hey, yes…but….
Who are you? It is Ramsha’s home. 
Hey one minute, where are you running off to? Who are you people? Greetings madam, we have come 
to interview Ramsha from News Masala channel. Salma. Hey, who are these people? I don’t know. 
How are you related to Ramsha? Will you introduce yourself? She is Ramsha’s mother and 
I am Ramsha’s aunt. Greeting madam, we have a channel named
YouTuber News Interviews on YouTube, and it is a really famous channel and
we want to interview Ramsha. Excuse me, first I will interview her. I spoke to her first. You have asked them for permission 
for the interview. These people have not 
given you permission. Yes, mister, what else? You don’t know how famous 
your friend has become. Yes, but when do you have time
 to research about me. You are so busy that 
you don’t even have time for. When will you see…
Ramsha. Afnan, I will talk to you later. Goodbye.
 What happened? All okay? Those people are here. Who has come? YouTubers and God knows people from 
what channel have come to take your interview. What? Madam, our channel is really famous. You leave these people, 
and call Ramsha. If Ramsha gives us the first interview, then you will see how much 
your daughter will progress. We also got a lot of gifts for you
and your family. Look, I told you… Madam, try and understand. She said it. She said we don’t want 
to give an interview. Can you not hear me? 
We don’t need any gift. You leave from here. 
For God’s sake leave. Hey, leave. Hello. Hello Ramsha. I have a YouTube channel 
by the name of news masala. I want to interview you. 
You must have seen it. Yes. Yes. I have seen you. Ramsha, you must know me. 
I do a lot of programs on YouTube. I got a lot of gifts for you and 
your family too. I am sure you will give your 
first interview to me. Hey, yes, I know you. You took her interview, she became so famous 
after your interview. Take my interview, please. 
Ramsha Yes?
You wont give an interview, go to your room.
No. No. No, don’t you hear what your mother is saying?
 Go inside. We just want a little time…
Come on, go. You just go. 
Go. You come on. 
Mama, let us give an interview Let them take an interview, it is really good. 
I told you she doesn’t have to give an interview. If her father and uncle finds out, 
they will get really upset. The environment of our home
 is not like that. You do us a favour and go. Madam, please…
Hey, go child, go. For God’s sake go. Madam just once… Let us talk to her once. 
Excuse me please. Please let us talk to her once. 
Hello. What are you people doing here? Do you like in this home? Yes, this is my home, but 
what are you people doing here? I am her cousin, but what are you people 
doing here? Come on. We had come here to interview Ramsha. Can you tell us about your cousin,
 that what does she do? What are her routines? I will tell you well. Be quiet. 
Get out. Get out. Please you…
Get out. Get out. You tell us how are you related 
to Ramsha, please? I will tell you well. Get out. Get out. Switch off this camera. Switch it off. Get out. They think it is a joke. That is why I used to tell you people to stop her,
 don’t let her make these videos. But she didn’t listen to me. Now did you see the result of that? Mehnaz you did good that you stopped those people from 
interviewing, Ramsha. The passion to get yourself known 
and become famous in this world of social media seems 
the easiest way to the younger generation. This shiny path is not shining 
with any light, actually, it shines with a dangerous fire. And the youngster get deceived 
trying to find the way. Later they find out it is not light, it is a burning fire and a small spark rising from 
a little carelessness doesn’t take long to burn the person. You are right brother. Absolutely right. But when do children understand this? They don’t consider this fire dangerous, they consider it a ray of hope. But as parents it is our responsibility 
to save them from this fire. Mehnaz, you tell Ramsha not to get 
involved in all this. Hey, these channel people will give her
 importance for their rating, and when their need is fulfilled they will not give her any importance. They don’t care if our daughter 
gets defamed or her respect is ruined. It doesn’t matter to them at all. I myself am so worried. I am getting so many calls since morning. Someone says that they are talking 
from a channel, someone says I am a YouTuber, sometimes some one from the newspaper,
 the magazine, I don’t know where all we are getting 
calls from, I am worried. Sister in law you did right. There is no need, our Ramsha will 
not give an interview to anyone. And Shani, no need to say anything 
without a reason. Let the world speak what they want. Mind your own business. Don’t think hard. It is the times of social media, every other day someone’s video 
will go viral. We should be satisfied about this, papa, that our Ramsha has listened to us. No need to be strict needlessly. What do you understand? Make him understand. Hey, leave. Hello. Hello Ramsha. 
I have a YouTube channel by the name of news masala. 
I want to interview you. You must have seen it. Yes. Yes. I have seen you. Ramsha, you must know me. 
I do a lot of programs on YouTube. I got a lot of gifts for you and 
your family too. I am sure you will give your 
first interview to me. Hey, yes, I know you. You took her interview, she became so famous 
after your interview. Take my interview, please. 
Ramsha Yes?
You wont give an interview, go to your room.
No. No. No, don’t you hear what your mother
is saying? Go inside. We just want a little time…
Come on, go. You just go. 
Go. You come on. Ramsha. Ramsha. You are sitting here, I looked for you all around the home. It would have been so good had mama 
and aunt let me give an interview today. I got a really good chance, 
I could have progressed really far. What do you want to progress in? You wanted to be famous, 
that has been fulfilled. Now what is the issue, Ramsha. You know the environment of 
our home is not like that. Elder papa, papa were getting so angry. On top of that brother Shani 
was getting so angry. Don’t take your brother’s name 
in front of me. He is jealous of my success. He couldn’t do anything in life himself, 
that’s why. What is the meaning of success? Success is when you have done 
something great in your life, in which you have betterment 
in the world and hereafter too. Where is your betterment in this? No betterment in the world, 
nor in the hereafter. I don’t know when we will understand 
the meaning of success. Nowadays, this is what you call success. A few people recognize you. You have wealth, fame, home, car, a good job. This is what they call success. 
Understand? and respect? Where did respect go in your success, 
Ramsha? Hey, when you have all these things, then respect will come automatically. You wont have to run 
or work hard for respect. Respect will come after you. What are you saying? Why? I am right. 
Did I say something wrong? This is the real meaning of success it. You and I can deny it, 
but we cannot say no. So it would be better that you accept 
this reality and understand it. And come to the world, so that you find out 
what is going on in the world. Afnan. 
Yes? A person shouldn’t so selfish. You didn’t even ask me 
once how my day was. Hey, so tell me, how was your day? I wont tell you. Okay fine, I have kept down the ice cream, 
I have switched off the phone. Tell me, madam, how was your day? 
What happened? The day was really good. 
But you know what happened? A lot of YouTubers came home 
to interview me. Ohhh. But my mama didn’t give permission. You know, I am getting so many calls
 and messages. People want to meet me, 
they want to interview me, they want to know about me, but my family, they are not giving me permission. They are not giving permission. 
Yes. You know, if you look at it in a way, I feel your family did the right thing. Whatever decisions parents make, they do it for a better future 
of their children. No? Afnan, that is fine, but our parents should think that 
we too have wishes, we have a heart. They don’t listen to us, they are not ready
 to agree to anything we say. They think that they gave birth to the child, 
they brought them up, now they are their ownership. Now they will order them 
around like they want. This is not how it works, right? Absolutely. But I feel that when you become a parent maybe that’s when you will realize that your mother is absolutely right. When you go through the pain, 
then you realize it. Now how much pain and worries you
 and I would have given our parents. When we go through it, 
we will realize it. No? Okay, if I have your permission, 
can I eat my ice cream? It is melting. Yes, yes, sure. 
You have your ice cream, because the ice cream is 
more important than me. You have no interest 
in what I am saying. Okay fine, I wont eat. Afnan, your phone again. It is an important call, 
please one minute. Hello. Greetings. Greetings. Where are you Afnan? Yes, I am in the office. 
Why? All okay? Yes, I actually wanted to go out so brother took the car and went, 
so I thought I would go with you. Oh, I am really busy, 
I have back to back meetings. If you want I will coordinate with the driver,
he will come to you. No, no, it is alright, I will manage. Goodbye. Listen, come on we have 
to go somewhere. No. Hey, come on, I will also pick your bag. 
Quickly. Quickly. Afnan. 
Come on. Come on. Greetings mama. Greetings. I am really tired today. I had back to back meetings 
in the office. I have told you to take two to 
four days leaves from the office, but you don’t listen to me. Mama, I am not married 
that I take leaves. Who takes leave in engagement? Alizay, did you talk to Afnan or did he tell you something? No, I didn’t talk to Afnan 
about anything. You should call Afnan, you should know where he is right now. Why mama? Did something happen? nothing has happened but you should call and ask him 
what his routine is, where is he. Did someone say something? No one said anything to me. After all, he is your fiancé, and you should know where 
he is right now, with whom is he. Mama, tell me honestly, did someone say something? 
Is something worrying you? Did Afnan say something to you? Just like uncle, does Afnan too have complaints 
from me after the engagement. I think you have not taken out 
what brother said from your heart. Mama, nothing like that. I was just saying it. Afnan said nothing to me. I just thought of it, so I thought 
I would say it to you. Look, he is you fiancé now. You should call him two 
to three times a day. He will like it if you show care and this will also make 
your relationship stronger. Fine, mama. Okay have food served, 
I am really hungry. Where are you Ramsha? I even tell her not to do these things. What is the time? Oh God, I am really late, 
elder mama will kill us. Annie. Annie. I am here. I am here. Ramsha, I have been standing on the road
for so long and waiting for you, you know I would have stood for long, 
I would have gone home. Sorry, forgive me. 
You know what happened? Afnan dropped me so far
 I walked from there and came. I couldn’t find a rickshaw. Ramsha, the path you are walking 
on will not have a good end. Annie, what is wrong with you? Afnan is sincere with me, 
and I am also sincere with him. I have met him so many times, he never did anything wrong with me. If I have chosen him in my life, then I would have done it 
after thinking. You are worried for no reason. Really? You have lied to him about 
so many things. If he finds out what will happen? Will he stay sincere the same way
 as he is today. You have lied so much to Afnan he can also hate you in future. There is no chance. It is not possible that he will hate me, and when the time comes 
I will tell him the truth. Now don’t worry, nor worry me. Why didn’t you get a rickshaw for so long? I was waiting for you. You should have at least stopped a rickshaw. Come on, come here. Hey, you are Ramsha, right?
The shopping girl. Yes. Do you live here? Yes, my home is two streets away. You were being mentioned 
in the morning show today. My mention? In the morning show? Are you speaking the truth? Why would we lie? You watch it, the show is repeated. Oh wow, I will go and watch it 
again on the internet. You come to our home. We live in the home
 with the blue gate. I will introduce you to my cousin. Yes, sure. Okay bye. 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Annie, I have become so famous people have 
started to recognize me on the road and I am being mentioned 
in the morning show. Wow. Come on, come quickly. Mama will hit us. 
Come on. Come one. Hurry. Where are you Afnan? Yes, I am in the office. 
Why? All okay? Yes, I actually wanted to go out so brother took the car and went, 
so I thought I would go with you. Oh, I am really busy, 
I have back to back meetings. If you want I will coordinate with the driver,
he will come to you. Mama, I cannot do this work. I cannot do it, but… Who is it, man? Who is this? Hello. Yes. Yes, yes, this is Ramsha Sajid. 
Who are you? What? Salma, both those suits were really good and you got them so cheap. Mama. Mama. Ouch. Ramsha have gone mad? 
Watch where you are going. Move out of the way. 
Move out of the way. What happened? 
You know who called me right now? Sister Shiza. Who Shiza? We have no Shiza
 in our family. Hey mama, I am not talking 
about our family. The one whose morning show 
you watch daily, I got a call from her. She is inviting me to her show 
as a guest. What? Shiza? You know these two watch that 
show with a lot of interest. Ramsha, I cannot believe 
she invited you to the show. I am speaking the truth. Her assistant called and she invited me 
to her show tomorrow. I told her I will ask my mother and tell her. I have ten to fifteen minutes, mama. 
I have to call and tell her just now. Yes, sister in law. Yes. Hey mama, listen to me once. 
Stop it. Mama. What is wrong? What is the problem with going 
in the morning show? You watch the morning show 
with a lot of interest. And after all, has anyone in our family
 been seen on TV till now? No, right? I will be seen. You should be happy. Really happy. But see, you are getting so worried,
 without a reason. Now you quickly say yes,
because she has called twice. I have to answer her. Let your papa come, 
I will talk to him. If he says that you can go, 
then you can go. Mama, you say yes, at least. 
I will convince papa like this. Anyway, your papa must be on the way. Talk to him. If he allows, go. I am telling you. Hey mama, why don’t you understand? It is such a big channel and 
such a morning show too. This is nothing ordinary. And mama, you know my friends long 
to sit in the audience of this morning show. And me? I have been invited 
for an interview. This is a big deal. Mama, let’s go it will be fun. You know, she has said bring 
your mother along. So what is the problem in it? Mama, till today no one from our family
has come on TV. I will come on TV. Along with me, you too will come. If you say that I will put a status
 on whatsapp that don’t forget to watch me and my mama 
in the morning at 9 am in the morning show. What say? Yes, but till your papa doesn’t say yes, you cannot go. Mama, you don’t understand me. Look, when I tell papa that I am going 
to the morning show tomorrow. I know he will be really happy. And they are calling me 
again and again. I have to pick out clothes, 
I have to pick our jewellery. Mama. Mama, please say yes. Please, if you say yes, 
then I will convince papa. Papa, please let me go. I am getting such a big opportunity. Not everyone gets such chances. And I am not going alone, they have also
invited mama along with me. They said I will get a really good protocol and they will also drop us back home. Please let me go. When I said no, 
then why are you insisting? Papa…
Let her go. After all, it is a family show. I will go with her, I will bring her back. 
The child is insisting. She is a child, 
that is why she is insisting. You are grown up, 
at least you understand. Hey, these channel people are like that. They care about their rating. They want rating at all cost. 
That’s what they do. I don’t know how they present things 
with exaggeration. They would ask the child one thing, 
and she would say something else. She doesn’t know about these things. Hey, why don’t I know papa? I am not stupid that I will say anything. I will answer correctly. Try and understand me. 
I promise you the show will be really good, 
everything will be really good. Please, let me go. I am making wish for the last time. 
After this, I will not make a wish or desire. Please, let me go. 
You say the same thing on every wish. I promise, this is the last, 
I will not make a wish after this. Please let me go. Okay, agree. Please. Please. Last time. After this, 
she won’t make a wish. Please, last time. I promise, 
for the last time. Please agree, please, 
please, please. Fine. Papa. Thank you so much. Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you. If I say no once, don’t make me say yes. Afnan, son, did you keep everything? Yes, dad I have packed all your clothes, I have also kept your night suits. Okay see, your mobile charger 
and powerbank is in this pocket. It is good. Fine. Dad, you will be back 
by Monday, right? We have a really important meeting 
with Mr. Munir, it is necessary for you to be there. It is just a religious gathering
 for three days, we will have a congregational prayer 
on Sunday, then I will come. Brother, Alizay made shami kebabs for you. Uncle. Hey child, why did you bother? 
What was the need? You also get food there. Brother, you won’t get the taste 
like home. Hey, controlling your wishes, 
controlling your desires, connecting with God is the objective 
of religious gathering. If going there, 
the heart is attached here, and the heart runs after desires,
 then what is the point. Uncle, I made him with a lot of effort. Hey child, I won’t break your heart. I will take it and share it 
with friends there. Dad, I will take out the car. 
Yes, fine. Okay, you drop me to the mosque, 
we will go from there. Fine dad. Absolutely fine. Pray for us. yes, uncle pray for me the most. I pray for all of you. Live long, may God protect you. Okay, bye. Goodbye. 
Bye. Here you go, these are all the dresses, I have. Select one from it and please wear it
 on the show in the morning. I don’t like a single dress from them. I don’t understand what I should wear, 
all the dresses are useless. What do I do? We will do one thing. Last week, a Tik Toker, wore a maxi 
in sister Shiza’s show. She looked good. You too try wearing a maxi, 
you will look really pretty. No, man, Annie. The fashion of maxi is old I want that I wear the good dress 
of today’s fashion. Elder papa shouldn’t have given you
 permission. Have you gone mad?
What nonsense is this? I got permission with so much difficulty, you say stupid things and 
give it the evil eye. I don’t understand what… Annie. Savera’s sister got married ten days back,
 right? She has so many dresses, why don’t we go to her and take them? Will you wear Shararas and ghararas
 to the morning show? Hey, I am not wearing shararas 
and ghararas, apart from that she has a lot of 
other frocks and clothes. Lets do one thing, let’s go to her 
and get two to three colour frocks. No. Annie, please, are you not my beloved sister? Annie, are you not my friend? Please, please, please, 
we will go for ten minutes and come back quickly. 
Annie, please. Mama won’t give permission. Please, please, please,
 my beloved sister, come with me, 
I don’t want to go alone, we will quickly go get the dress 
and come. You bother me a lot, Ramsha. Go. Quickly go get ready, 
and come with me. While I will wear my scarf and come.
 Go. Go. Go. This girl is completely mad. Okay. Thank you very much. Afnan, are you busy? No, no, aunt, I am not busy at all. 
What happened? I feel you have made a lot of new friends. I am noticing you are really busy 
in your phone nowadays. Really? No aunt, I don’t feel this way. Just for work, and when will I 
make new friends. You know, I don’t have time. I spend all my time in the office. I just have a few old friends, 
who message me at times, so I talk to them. How will I make new friends? Yes, after all, you and Alizay will get married. When you get married, then when will you get time for friends. After marriage, a person belongs
to the family, right? Yes, you are absolutely right. You are really smart, Afnan, and I expect you to be this smart. Aunt. Why are you saying this?
 I will never disappoint you. Good. Come on, I will go. 
You enjoy your tea. Do you see? The office so huge and beautiful. Yes, you know these channel people 
have such big offices. Hey, aunt Khalida’s daughter 
also works in a channel office. She was telling me that the office is so big and 
the entire office has an AC. And these people really care 
for their employees. Hey if they have to travel 
within the country, they send them by plane. They spend millions. They really care for their employees. You are right. That’s true, they really care. Hey Ramsha, we have been here for long, 
why are they not calling us? Mama, lower your voice, it is just 7 am, and the morning show starts at 9 am. There are a lot of issues inside. 
Have patience, wait a little. Still they should call us.
Now it is really late. Mama, they have to set things, they have to put up things, there are lights,
there are cameras, wait. Hello Ramsha. Hi. Mama, come on. How are you?
I am good. This is my mother. Greetings madam. 
Greetings. My name is Komal, you spoke to me with regards to the show. Yes. Yes. Did you people face any worry 
or difficulty coming here? No, no, nothing happened. No, child ,we came in a taxi and the taxi dropped us here directly. Okay, that’s good. Ramsha, you come with me, 
we will do your hair and makeup. Then we will take you to the set. Fine. 
Hey, but she has put on makeup, 
what else do you want to do? Aunty, you are right, but when we come in front of the camera,
it has some requirements. In fact, you will also have to get your hair 
and makeup done. And we are giving you 
two the wardrobe. You two do one thing, 
come with me. Me… Yes. Yes. Mama, yes. 
Come on. Come on. Our makeup will start soon. 
Yes. Ramsha, this is our makeup artist, Nomi. Hello Ramsha. 
Hi. How are you? I am good. How are you?
I am good. Nomi, you know you only have 
fifteen minutes to prepare Ramsha. Don’t worry, I will prepare her 
in ten minutes. Ramsha, come with me. 
Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, what is wrong? And what is this shamelessness? A man will do my daughter’s makeup?
 No. No. No. Aunty, this is our makeup artist, Nomi. Hey, he may be your makeup artist, but no man will do 
my daughter’s make up. that’s it, I have told you.
You people should be ashamed. Aunty, please calm down. Maybe you saw all this for the first time. That is why you are so hyper. Ramsha, you make your mother understand, all this is really normal nowadays. Yes, mama, it is normal. It is normal. Be quiet, normal! That’s it, I have had enough. What justice is this that whatever 
they say we will agree to it. Whether it is good or bad. No makeup artist will do 
your make up and nor will you sit here and 
give an interview. This doesn’t happen, come on. 
Aunty. Aunty. Aunt. Relax. Relax. If you don’t want that 
Nomi does Ramsha’s makeup then it will not happen. 
Nomi, you leave. I have another makeup artist Ruby, she will do Ramsha’s makeup, 
you don’t worry. Yes, best. Fine. 
This is fine, mama. Ruby will do my makeup, 
you sit comfortably. Aunty, you sit, I will take you for makeup after Ramsha. Come on. 
Ramsha, you come on. Come on. Come on. it is really late. She should have come by now. I will go and check. Listen, my daughter Ramsha was taken 
for makeup to style her hair. It has been long, 
she has not come back. Where is your makeup room? You go straight and take a left,
the makeup room is there. Okay, thank you. Standby Shiza, we are going on air. Three. Two. One. Cue. Greetings, good morning Pakistan. How are all of you? 
I hope all of you will be fine. You must be smiling, 
you must be laughing. May God keep you laughing 
and smiling like this. Amen. Viewers this is the prayer
