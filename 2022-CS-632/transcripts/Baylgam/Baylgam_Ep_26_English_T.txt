[23.44] It’s good that I found you here Shani.
[27.68] Listen, I am very tired,
[30.92] you will go to the hospital and 
stay with brother today,
[35.84] I want to take some rest.
[38.20] Dad, I, in the hospital 
I feel suffocated there.
[42.60] And how will I sleep?
[45.00] Wow, amazing!
[47.52] Who is sending you to sleep there?
[49.96] You fool, the attendant has to stay awake
 for the patient at the hospital,
[53.84] you must stay awake too and 
take care of brother,
[57.04] have some fear of God, 
I am your father.
[61.04] He cannot sleep at the hospital.
[63.32] Okay, I will go, I will go.
[64.96] Yes, son, Shani,
[66.64] your father is right if he keeps on running
back and forth to the hospital,
[70.28] he will get unwell too.
[72.64] Okay I will go.
[81.44] Uncle, these are the jewellery 
of Mom and I,
[88.12] you must sell them and 
get dad’s surgery done.
[149.20] Thank God,
[150.96] you got some sense,
[152.44] some sense of realization 
towards your dad,
[159.32] I will sell them and see how much money
 I can get from them,
[163.76] obviously,
[165.16] who will pay the rest of the amount,
[167.88] I will have to pitch in,
[177.52] after all he is my brother, 
I cannot let my brother die.
[193.52] What you did is good,
[196.72] stay blessed.
[202.28] Just pray
[204.24] that May God give good health to brother.
[207.96] Amen.
[212.60] Anwar,
[214.40] when brother Noman said that he will 
get you the discount on the surgery
[218.64] then you should have told that to Ramsha,
[223.64] because the cost of the surgery could also 
have been arranged from the shop.
[228.44] Quiet! Quiet!
[234.08] Don’t you dare say a word more,
[237.68] what and I doing and how am I doing it, 
I know that very well.
[245.92] This is my and my brother’s personal matter,
[248.28] you don’t have to interfere in between, 
do you understand?
[255.92] Their pet!
[267.16] Just do one thing,
[270.28] one second.
[276.08] I have taken a picture of it,
[282.88] now keep them in the locker, good girl.
[292.32] Show it to me mom.
[295.20] Wow,
[297.96] uncle has saved a lot of money.
[305.72] Brother Sajid is not like your father,
[308.80] he is very intelligent,
[310.96] he has saved all his life and that is 
what is helping him today.
[316.04] Your dad didn’t save a penny till date
[318.76] and even if I tried saving something,
[321.20] he would come up with some excuse 
and get it out of me and spend it.
[341.48] Fahad, you are such a big character, 
you don’t know yourself.
[345.28] How do you do it?
[347.16] Brother, your friend does 
what no one can.
[351.84] By the way, I forgot telling you
something.
[354.28] Tell me.
[355.40] That girl, that friend of yours?
[360.20] Who?
[361.48] The one who make amazing videos?
[365.96] One of her reels also got viral
 a few days ago.
[368.32] That shopping girl Ramsha.
[371.24] Yes.
[372.52] My cousin Nabeel almost got married to her.
[379.08] What do you mean by almost got married.
[381.04] just think that they didn’t get married.
[384.64] Why?
[385.80] I saw that girl on the wedding day, in fact 
right at the time of marriage ceremony,
[389.60] I saw her and immediately recognized her,
[392.84] I told her entire history to my aunt 
and my cousin,
[400.76] in fact, I showed all her videos to them.
[408.28] Actually, my paternal family is very 
well behaved and traditional,
[411.88] they are far away from all this 
social media etc,
[414.64] the poor people didn’t know. 
One second.
[419.68] Yes, hello?
[427.48] What?
[429.28] Speak louder I cannot hear. 
One sec I will take this call.
[448.84] Actually, the thing is
[451.16] that the pain that my entire family 
is going through,
[454.64] no one has a solution to it.
[461.04] At least share the problem.
[466.76] Umm,
[470.36] what should I say?
[475.12] The time has passed...
[510.84] How can you even think 
that I will marry you?
[514.16] Actually, it’s my fault,
[515.84] I shouldn’t have been friends 
with you at all,
[520.00] I thought she is an innocent girl 
who keeps on getting herself in trouble
[522.60] so let me help her but you have been 
after me instead
[529.32] and why would I marry you?
[532.60] Who are you? What do you have?
[536.20] You left your studies.
[538.48] I have no idea about your 
family background,
[541.88] and you,
[542.88] you upload your videos 
on the social media
[545.36] so you can get famous, 
and I should marry you?
[623.52] Ramsha?
[626.52] Yes, dad?
[630.64] Go home, my child
[633.96] you must be tired.
[640.28] I am absolutely fine.
[646.20] And all my tiredness goes away 
when I look at you.
[654.68] You know what?
[657.28] I don’t feel like staying in home 
without you,
[660.32] the house feels very empty.
[670.20] Why are you looking at me like this?
[672.32] Do you need something?
[679.44] I am looking at how beautiful 
daughters are.
[690.56] You bring food for me daily 
in the morning,
[699.20] you take care of me all day 
without a frown,
[719.84] you are the same one who would get 
irritated if I asked you to do anything?
[731.24] But now
[734.28] you look very intelligent.
[739.44] That wasn’t irritation, dad,
[742.68] it was me being pampered 
and spoiled,
[748.44] I used to feel that no matter what I say
or whatever I refuse to do,
[753.88] my dad will never get upset with me.
[763.00] Forgive me.
[769.04] I know that I have made a huge mistake,
[773.92] please forgive me.
[775.84] No, no,
[780.12] that wasn’t irritation,
[783.88] I used to feel that was your childishness
[793.56] but now you have become all grown up
 and mature,
[807.00] those people, they didn’t value you at all, 
my child,
[816.48] he left my lovely daughter.
[849.88] Congratulations, 
the deal has been locked.
[852.56] Now at least get me coffee.
[856.48] Bro?
[865.28] So,
[867.80] what were you telling about 
Ramsha’s wedding?
[872.56] Yes, the story was left incomplete,
[874.80] then what else,
[876.28] who would just see everything 
and still go for it?
[878.12] When I told aunt,
[879.84] aunt humiliated them so much,
[883.36] we came back with the groom.
[893.76] I didn’t expect you to do something 
so pathetic Fahad.
[899.80] I couldn’t even have thought you would 
do something so disgusting,
[903.20] what was the need for you 
to do all that?
[906.76] What is wrong with you? 
Why are you feeling so bad?
[908.68] You got someone’s marriage broken,
[912.24] you ruined someone’s happy life and 
you are asking me why do I feel bad?
[916.80] Just imagine, Fahad, just imagine,
[918.60] had it been your own sister 
instead of Ramsha
[921.48] and some man would have done 
such a pathetic thing to her
[923.60] then what would you do?
[925.08] Listen, mind your tongue,
[927.20] the daughters and daughter-in-law 
of our homes
[929.52] doesn’t roam around doing 
such cheap things.
[931.32] Hey, what cheap things? 
What has she done?
[933.96] If there is something like that 
then you go and marry her.
[938.96] We should bring such daughter-in-law 
in our house?
[1006.12] That girl, that friend of yours, Ramsha,
[1008.12] my cousin Nabeel almost 
got married to her.
[1013.40] I saw that girl on the wedding day, in fact 
right at the time of marriage ceremony,
[1017.12] I saw her and immediately recognized her,
[1020.36] I told her entire history to my aunt 
and my cousin.
[1026.36] You got someone’s marriage broken,
[1029.88] you ruined someone’s happy life and 
you are asking me why do I feel bad?
[1034.56] Just imagine, Fahad, 
just imagine,
[1036.60] had it been your own sister 
instead of Ramsha
[1039.24] and some man would have done 
such a pathetic thing to her
[1041.56] then what would you do?
[1042.76] Listen, mind your tongue,
[1045.20] the daughters and daughter-in-law 
of our homes
[1047.36] doesn’t roam around doing 
such cheap things.
[1049.04] Hey, what cheap things? 
What has she done?
[1051.84] If there is something like that 
then you go and marry her.
[1062.72] You have no idea about the value 
of relationships, Ramsha,
[1066.72] you just care about your own self 
and your happiness
[1069.64] and I, you…
[1073.88] And yes, one last thing,
[1077.32] just thank God that it was me,
[1080.84] and I have been raised very well,
[1084.24] if it would have been some other guy,
[1087.52] he would have ruined your honor by now.
[1094.40] I and you can never get married.
[1115.52] Greetings, may peace be upon you. 
Hey sit, sit, sit.
[1119.32] Greetings.
[1128.44] What happened?
You look worried.
[1133.96] No dad.
[1136.00] Okay,
[1138.28] is everything well?
[1140.76] Yes dad, absolutely well.
[1146.68] By the way you can share with me 
if you want,
[1151.28] we are not just father and a son, 
we are good friends too.
[1156.08] Of course, dad I know
[1159.04] but
[1161.80] there is nothing like that 
so what should I tell you.
[1166.96] Afnan, I will agree to whatever you say
[1170.48] but your face tells something else.
[1175.28] Anyway,
[1177.16] if you don’t want to share then as you wish,
 that’s not a problem.
[1180.72] Umm, dad?
[1186.88] Dad, may I ask you something?
[1189.52] Yes. ask?
[1193.76] There is just a metaphorical situation,
it is not for real
[1197.92] but if you do something well with someone
[1202.28] and that too purely out of sympathy,
[1206.20] just out of sympathy,
[1208.68] but the other person takes it 
in the wrong manner,
[1214.88] takes a wrong meaning out of it
[1217.68] umm,
[1219.44] just say that the good you did,
[1224.24] comes back at you negatively
[1226.16] so then what will you do 
in such situation?
[1231.72] The good you do can never come back 
in a negative way.
[1236.16] If the good is just done 
for the sake of God,
[1242.28] it always helps you,
 in this world and hereafter,
[1247.36] you know these creatures, 
the human beings,
[1251.40] they forget the favors
[1254.48] but God never let a good deed
 go to waste.
[1257.84] A man should do what do you call that,
[1261.48] do a good deed and then forget about it.
[1264.76] Afnan, if you keep every person and 
the relationship
[1268.60] in its right place like our religion and 
the laws of our religions orders us,
[1276.52] you will never have to face any difficulty,
[1280.20] then you will never have any burden 
on your heart after doing any good deed,
[1285.76] you won’t feel heavy.
[1287.96] Rest assured. Hmm?
[1292.76] Thanks dad,
[1294.56] you have solved this complication too 
like always.
[1302.32] Will you have coffee?
[1303.88] Hey, you shared your feelings with me, 
now I will have coffee too.
[1308.24] Done, I will just get it.
[1340.48] Annie?
[1342.52] Annie?
[1343.68] Where are you coming back from 
at this time?
[1347.12] From the hospital.
[1349.92] Don’t lie,
[1351.68] tell me honestly where are you
coming from?
[1354.96] No matter where I am coming from you,
it’s none of your concern.
[1357.72] We have told you so many times 
not to go out of the house alone.
[1363.04] Don’t try to act like my father,
[1370.20] my father is still there with me 
by the grace of God.
[1373.72] Mind your own business.
[1375.56] Tell me honestly, 
where were you?
[1377.24] Who were you with? 
That boy was with you, right?
[1379.36] Brother, she is right,
[1381.88] she went with dad,
[1383.48] dad stayed there at the hospital 
so she came back on her own.
[1406.36] Why do you interfere?
[1408.24] Why do you give clarifications?
[1410.48] She was telling the truth,
[1412.56] I saw her leaving with dad myself.
[1414.72] You saw her leaving with dad,
[1417.16] you didn’t see who was she 
coming back with.
[1422.28] God knows what she does using 
hospital as an excuse,
[1425.08] what do we know where 
she must be hanging out.
[1430.00] She will never change.
[1432.68] You won’t either.
[1435.92] What did you say?
[1437.80] Nothing, shall I get you tea?
[1440.12] Yes, I will have tea.
[1442.96] I don’t know why I get headache 
when I talk to this girl.
[1450.08] I think she gets black magic done.
[1456.12] Anyway, go make tea.
[1482.80] Brother?
[1486.84] Brother?
[1490.08] Brother?
[1493.24] Doctor?
[1494.72] Doctor?
[1496.16] Doctor?
[1497.84] See what happened to my brother.
[1500.44] You must wait outside. 
What?
[1502.08] Yes.
[1572.56] Hello?
[1576.76] Oh God, what are you saying?
[1578.96] Oh God,
[1580.84] Indeed, to God we belong and 
to God we shall return.
[1584.64] What happened mom?
[1586.56] Annie?
[1588.24] Your uncle, your uncle is no more.
[1592.08] What?
[1594.76] Yes.
[1596.48] Mom?
[1598.32] what are you saying mom?
[1601.44] Uncle?
[1604.56] Your uncle.
[1700.48] What happened, Annie?
[1705.44] Stop crying, dad will get well, 
if God wills.
[1710.80] Annie, I am telling you dad will be fine, 
then, then why are you crying?
[1714.68] Stop crying.
[1717.84] Annie?
[1721.36] Annie, why are you crying? 
What happened? Tell me?
[1725.48] Tell me, what happened? 
Why aren’t you saying anything?
[1729.60] Uncle’s no more.
[1747.64] Are you mad?
What are you saying Annie?
[1749.92] Don’t lie Annie, that’s not possible.
[1752.44] Where is dad? Dad? Mom? 
Ramsha?
[1763.36] Afnan?
Hmm?
[1765.52] Are you busy?  
No, no, come, sit.
[1768.96] Actually, I was going to the mall
[1770.72] so I thought I should as you as well, 
you come along too
[1773.00] I need to take the car to the mechanic 
as well on the way back,
[1775.24] it will get a little easy for me.
[1777.52] How many times have I asked you 
to change your car now,
[1780.76] umm I am busy I can’t come right now, 
do one thing, take my car.
[1785.96] You know that my car is my lucky car,
[1788.72] you know wherever I go in that car, 
my work always gets done.
[1794.88] And you know what dad says?
[1796.64] Hmm?
[1797.52] Dad says that whatever is written 
in your fate,
[1801.12] you just get that.
[1804.08] Like you are in my fate?
[1809.84] Okay now I understand,
[1812.36] you have come here and sat on my head
so you won’t let me work now,
[1815.04] so let’s do one thing, let’s take 
your car to the mechanic.
[1817.80] Let’s go, I will get my bag.
[1819.36] Hmm.
[1820.64] And yes, I forgot telling something.
[1823.24] What?
[1824.40] You are the best.
[1829.64] I will be right back.
[1850.48] Sister-in-law?
[1851.92] Sister-in-law?
[1853.68] Say something, sister-in-law?

at least you don’t do that,

for God’s sake,
