[22.12] How is your office going, Afnan?
[25.08] It is going fine.
[30.08] Why do I feel you are in a bad mood?
[33.00] It feels like your wife fought with you.
[38.00] No, nothing like that.
[42.88] You thank God you have one wife,
[45.12] if you had another wife,
[47.68] God knows what would have 
happened to you.
[52.04] What happened?
[54.24] Nothing.
[55.92] I think a cat was crossing the path,
[58.28] I think it passed, so I was saving it.
[62.16] Okay.
[63.36] We have also reached your office.
[65.32] Yes, park over there.
[69.32] You look a little tensed.
[72.88] Is all okay?
[76.48] Yes, everything is okay.
[86.84] Are you hiding something from me?
[93.00] Why would I hide something from you?
[100.24] Why are you asking me this question?
[105.68] Okay, you came home late last night, 
where did you go?
[111.36] I went to a friend, 
you don’t know him.
[117.72] I am surprised,
[124.68] earlier all our friends were mutual
[134.36] but now I don’t know who my friend is
[137.60] and you don’t know who my friend is.
[147.60] Whenever I ask you, you always say
[149.84] you were with a friend.
[160.32] Also introduce me to 
this friend of yours.
[172.40] He should know I am your wife.
[180.96] Are you doubting me?
[184.04] Should I tell you the truth?
[192.04] No.
[193.40] I am not doubting you at all.
[200.64] Yes, I used to doubt you earlier,
[202.96] when Ramsha used to live 
in our home.
[212.64] But since Ramsha has left,
[215.28] I am at peace.
[228.28] Okay, I will see you then.
[230.60] Hmm. Bye.
[305.52] What?
[307.28] Alizay saw you?
[310.52] Ramsha…
[312.12] if you had seen Alizay earlier, 
then why did you go to her?
[319.36] What was the need for you to go, 
Ramsha?
[321.88] I didn’t see her Afnan.
[323.48] How was I to know 
I will see her suddenly
[325.96] and she saw me and she stopped me.
[330.84] A friend of her lives here.
[334.28] But I am worried that
[338.24] Alizay shouldn’t have seen you 
at this time and in this condition.
[347.60] Stay here tonight.
[350.80] Ramsha, I wont be able
 to stay today.
[355.24] Alizay’s condition is not good.
[360.64] I cannot leave her alone 
in this condition.
[366.84] If the condition was normal,
[370.24] I would have stayed, but…
But what?
[375.52] But I want that
[378.16] Alizay stay happy till the time 
our child doesn’t come to this world.
[383.80] No problem, Afnan.
[386.44] Maybe meeting like this was written
in our fate.
[577.52] I am sorry.
[584.60] I know you are really hurt 
with what I said,
[589.24] your heart is hurt.
[592.68] But I am sorry. That is why
 I came to apologize.
[606.80] What happened?
[608.00] Why are you looking at me like that?
[612.52] I am seeing
[614.88] that you show so much love 
for me in a moment,
[618.64] and what happens to you 
in the next moment,
[620.40] I am unable to understand, Afnan.
[624.32] Even I don’t understand.
[633.28] But maybe this is the way I love.
[654.08] Forgive me, please.
[669.60] How did you like them?
[672.24] Really good.
[675.72] Yes, but they are not 
as beautiful as you.
[679.36] Stop it. Don’t lie so much.
[681.40] I am not lying, 
I am speaking the truth.
[686.08] You know I love you a lot.
[690.76] You look really good.
[697.24] You know,
[700.24] I went to the office, 
but I couldn’t focus.
[709.00] I thought I would come to convince you.
[715.56] I saw these flowers on the way 
so I thought of you.
[719.64] So I bought them.
[721.60] Thank you, Afnan.
[725.52] Now that you have agreed,
can I do something I want?
[730.72] Yes.
[732.68] I have not eaten anything 
since last night.
[740.64] I didn’t even have breakfast, 
I am really hungry.
[744.12] You didn’t have breakfast?
[751.96] You sit, I will make breakfast 
in two minutes and bring it.
[753.88] What is the need to make breakfast, 
let’s go somewhere and have breakfast
[756.80] or we will order something good.
[758.04] Not at all, I will make breakfast 
for you myself.
[759.76] I forgot you wont agree.
[761.12] Okay, let’s do one thing, I will make 
breakfast for you today,
[763.68] I know how to make good cheese omelet.
Where are the eggs?
[772.08] Afnan, why are you cutting the fruit?
[774.24] I will ask in the kitchen, 
they will cut it.
[777.32] Hey, I know the people in the kitchen 
can cut it,
[779.68] but you don’t eat it when they cut it. 
Here you go, eat.
[783.76] Afnan, I had tea a little while back.
[787.00] I am in no mood to have fruit right now.
[789.52] Hey, Alizay, listen to something I say.
[799.56] You always become stubborn.
[801.16] You already didn’t listen to me 
about the office,
[803.40] now you are even going to the office.
[806.20] Look, if this is what you want to 
talk to me about, I will leave.
[808.84] Okay, wait. Wait.
[810.76] I wont talk about this.
[820.36] Happy?
[821.64] Come on, eat these fruits.
[825.84] I am eating.
[839.28] You know,
[841.08] the doctor has strictly said that
[843.20] you have to increase the intake of fruits 
and milk, you have a lot of weakness.
[847.76] Any other order?
[849.08] Hey, how can I order you, madam?
[850.84] I can only request you but 
you don’t even agree to that.
[854.56] Now I cannot agree to 
everything you say.
[859.60] Look, when am I telling you 
to quit your job?
[862.52] I am just saying you take leaves 
for some time from the office.
[867.60] Afnan, neither can I quit my job 
right now, nor can I take leaves.
[871.56] You know right now my job 
is really important.
[875.28] And your health?
[876.60] It is important too, you have 
to take care of that.
[881.20] What happened to me?
[883.00] Why are you and mama 
always after me?
[886.08] Hey man,
[887.68] whatever we are saying is in your care.
[894.16] Come on, Afnan. I am not a child.
[897.44] I can take care of myself.
[900.52] Okay, tell me something,
[906.08] you complained to mama 
about me, right?
[910.28] No.
[912.68] why would I complain about you?
[915.92] I know everything.
[921.48] You have complained to mama 
about me,
[923.40] that is why she is after me that 
I quit the office.
[927.24] You tell me, what else could I do?
[936.16] You clearly said no to me.
[945.24] Yes, but I knew it wont be easy 
for you to say no to aunt.
[951.72] So you took advantage of this.
[953.96] So I did it all for your betterment.
[960.20] It is good, just rest.
[964.80] Afnan, I don’t understand you.
[973.36] I too feel the same way about you 
in this regard.
[1010.56] How are you feeling now?
[1012.44] Mama, it is the same nowadays, 
nothing special.
[1015.52] How are you feeling?
[1018.00] I am fine.
[1019.08] Okay listen, I had to go.
[1034.28] You do one thing, 
please sleep on time.
[1038.84] Where are you going?
[1044.72] I have a meeting, I am going 
to attend it and come back.
[1055.84] Afnan, schedule your work a little.
[1071.44] Now you should be with her 
at this time.
[1086.52] You are absolutely right, aunt.
[1095.04] But this meeting came in such 
an urgency, that I have to go.
[1098.20] A deal has to be locked.
Once it is locked,
[1100.20] there will be no issue.
[1112.64] Okay fine, come back soon.
[1119.68] When do you worry for me, Afnan?
[1127.52] Hey, why are you saying this?
[1129.20] I will just go and come back in a flash.
[1142.08] You just sleep on time. In fact, aunt
[1144.92] it is your responsibility.
[1147.04] Alizay should go in her room on time.
[1152.36] Fine.
[1162.76] Okay take care of yourself. 
Goodbye.
[1165.44] Goodbye.
[1167.92] Mama…
[1169.16] Alizay, now things are settling down.
[1181.68] He cares for you so much.
[1191.68] He has gone for some work, 
he will come back. Don’t worry.
[1293.48] What did you pray for?
[1315.24] Why should I tell you?
[1317.24] This is between me and my God.
[1319.76] You don’t tell anyone this.
[1322.64] Yes, you don’t tell anyone.
[1325.56] But all your prayers are answered.
[1334.76] So I was thinking that
[1340.72] I ask you to put in a good word 
for me too.
[1343.72] I pray for you.
[1346.32] I always pray for you.
[1349.48] Yes, but,
[1352.12] there is a prayer that I especially
 want you to make.
[1356.28] What?
[1360.48] That may God ease all my difficulties.
[1378.08] May we always be together.
[1394.16] And all the worries that are there,
[1403.20] may those end too.
[1407.28] I will pray.
[1410.28] Thank you.
[1413.12] Shall we go now? 
Come on.
[1415.68] Wait, I will go get my bag.
[1416.84] Okay listen. 
Yes?
[1419.28] You didn’t tell me how do I look?
[1423.72] You look good.
[1426.56] Really? I only look good.
[1430.64] I understand. One minute.
[1432.72] No, you look really pretty.
[1437.20] Thank you. I will go get my bag. 
Two minutes.
[1450.68] Yes, aunt.
[1453.28] You come home immediately.
[1456.12] What happened?
 All okay?
[1457.92] No, nothing is fine.
[1464.80] Alizay has created a scene at home.
[1468.88] What does this mean? 
What is she doing?
[1472.04] Afnan, I am trying to give her, 
her medication,
[1474.52] but she is refusing to take it.
[1484.56] She is getting so angry,
[1486.24] you please come home 
and control things.
[1489.60] Fine aunt, you don’t worry. 
I am coming.
[1492.72] Okay.
[1495.40] Come on, Afnan.
[1499.04] Ramsha,
[1501.72] we wont be able to go.
[1504.52] Why? What happened, Afnan?
[1507.68] Aunt called. I have to go home.
[1518.60] Alizay has created a scene again.
[1528.32] She is not taking her medication 
and the doctor has strictly said
[1531.04] she needs to take her medication 
on time.
[1532.64] I am sure she wouldn’t have eaten
 anything either,
[1534.64] I will have to go and 
sort these matters.
[1543.16] We will plan for some other day. 
We will go tomorrow.
[1548.24] I am sorry,
[1551.72] I will have to go.
[1556.28] Please Ramsha.
[1558.08] Please, understand me.
[1563.36] Fine, Afnan.
[1569.04] You are right.
[1571.36] We will cancel the plan, 
no problem.
[1574.24] Ramsha.
[1576.48] Ramsha, please listen to me.
 Ramsha.
[1578.44] Ramsha,
[1580.88] please open the door.
[1584.52] Ramsha, I know you are being mistreated,
but what can I do?
[1587.64] I am helpless.
[1590.76] Ramsha.
[1599.76] Fine,
[1601.88] don’t open the door.
[1604.12] I am mad that I am making 
so much effort.
[1606.60] I am leaving. goodbye.
[1615.60] Alizay, please go and 
have your medicine.
[1618.36] Mama, I don’t want to eat 
the medicine.
[1621.28] Can I say something?
[1622.44] Not just me, but even Afnan is getting 
tired of this stubbornness of yours.
[1638.48] You should thank God
[1641.08] that God gave you such 
a loving husband.
[1644.48] Yes, I have such a loving husband
[1647.16] that you called him two hours back.
[1654.00] He didn’t even bother to come 
and ask me.
[1660.12] Okay are you not my love,
[1661.52] go and have your medicine.
[1670.08] Alizay, now you have to take care 
of your future child along with yourself.
[1684.68] Did you not hear 
what the doctor said?
[1687.00] He said you really need 
to care for your health.
[1691.88] Mama, you and Afnan,
[1693.60] both of you only blackmail me 
emotionally.
[1698.24] What have I done?
[1702.84] Hello.
[1707.12] What?
[1713.36] What happened, Alizay?
[1726.36] Mama, that…
[1728.76] What is the matter? Speak up.
[1730.80] Mama, Afnan. Afnan.
[1733.08] What happened to Afnan?
[1804.72] You are treating me well,
[1811.64] I married you and kept you here.
[1818.68] I have deprived you of all your rights,
[1828.08] I even feel embarrassed looking you 
in the eyes.
[1841.32] And how can I live with Alizay?
[1846.08] I have no respect or place in her eyes
[1851.80] and if I tell you the truth,
[1854.60] she wants to live with me out of 
stubbornness and not out of her love.
[1882.12] Who is there?
[1895.72] Greetings brother Jamshed.
[1897.40] You are here at this hour? All okay?
[1899.64] Madam Ramsha, Afnan…
[1904.04] Mr. Afnan had an accident.
[1908.64] What? How?
[1911.52] I just got a call from home, 
his car had an accident.
[1914.84] Yes, but where is Afnan? 
What happened to him? Is he fine?
[1919.16] I don’t know that.
[1925.20] But I have heard they took him 
to the hospital.
