of me Aunty, please end the relation, accept me Aunty [Music] That's enough [Music] My daughter has not committed any big crime for which you people are punishing her [Music] If this is the fate of gentlemen, that they bring a marriage procession and disrespect other's sisters and daughters, then we are not that gentlemen [Music] Before I push you out, go away, go and stop me  I don't know how many jails I have been in, whom should I tell about the sorrows I have seen, I do n't know how many I have suffered, whom should I tell about the sorrows I have seen, I have cried on the roads, I have seen myself washed in tears, this is what I got as my reward, I got betrayal from my friend, oh I got betrayal from my friend, I lost my heart as well, I lost my life as well, this is what I got as my reward, this is that place, come on, you also come with me, I don't want to go, you give it to me, I am waiting here, hey, what happened, why will you sit alone in the car, I won't let you stay alone here, come on, what happened to me, Afnan, I can't go, you go, okay baba, it's okay, I just went and came back like this, okay, minute listen, lock the doors, okay [ Music] okay [Music] Bhaijaan, let's go home, it's quite late, how long will we sit here [Praise] I don't have the courage to face the people [Music] [ Praise] [ Music] the grave has broken [Music] I feel as if there is no life in my legs  As for me [Music] my steps will not support me [Music] [Praise] my respect has been reduced to dust I wish I had also been reduced to dust along with this disgrace it would have been so nice [Music] it would have been [Music] [Praise] [Music] [Music ] [ Music] [Music] [Music] Salaam waleukum ji waleukum alam Afnan ji I am really sorry I think I am very late in coming all your guests have already left Oh no no Afnan Miya sometimes coming late is better than coming on time Sir you anyway this dad had arranged for you thank you very much your dad is a very kind hearted person he helped us at a big time we are indebted to him he is a very good man thank you sir I am leaving please allow me sir [Music] thank you [Music] excuse me if you are doing so are you troubled it seems by looking at your face that is why I am asking I can understand that you might not want to share your problem with me but dad loves you people very much relieved you are sharing your  Share your problem with me, maybe I can't help you in any way, the fact is that no one has a solution to the problem that I and my entire family are going through, you please share it, what is the problem, what should I tell you, now time has passed, the wedding procession did not come, the wedding procession did not come, I mean how can this happen, this is a very wrong thing, it is not wrong, this is oppression, suddenly we came to know that their son does not want to marry our daughter [Sangeet] [Sangeet] I am really sorry but he cheated you people, you people should take action against him and if I need any help in that, then please tell me, he has cheated you a lot, Allah will do better for now, please allow me a lot [Sangeet] thank you [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [Sangeet] [ Sangeet] I gave the money, I gave the money [Sangeet] yes what's the matter Anan you are fine, yes I am fine but there was a lot of tension there, there was a strange atmosphere, because of that I am getting a little depressed [Sangeet] you think yourself, those people with whom you were getting married turned out to be cheaters Now a middle class father did all this for his daughter in this time of inflation, I wonder what he must be going through, but you have paid the money, so why are you getting tensed, you have paid the money, that is not the issue [sangeet] I was just thinking that that poor girl, her marriage procession did not come, what must she be going through, first of all in the matter of service to the people, you are no less than Mamu Jaan [sangeet], you want to roam around taking the tension of the whole world, leave these things, no Ali, this is not the issue, I was just thinking that why are the people who are innocent getting punished and the ones who are actually guilty must be roaming around freely, what are we engaged in, we Afghans, we should talk about ourselves, since the time we came out, we are carrying the problems of others on our heads, yes you are absolutely right, we should talk about ourselves, then tell me what is the intention, I say, let's elope and get married, we will leave later, I got trapped by getting engaged to you, so the question of elopement and marriage does not arise at all, this is the problem  I am always insecure about you. I am scared that I don't know when Alize will leave me and run away and I will be left alone with my broken heart. [Music] You think I can leave you. I trust myself more than you [Music] You [Music] I have switched off my phone for two-four days. Otherwise people will spoil my mind by asking questions. My head is bursting with pain. Obviously, people will question beyond what has happened. Whatever it was, Nabeel's mother should not have created such a ruckus in front of the entire family. If she did not want to get married, she should have sat and talked to Sajid Bhai and Bhabhi separately. Why are you cursing Nabeel's mother? What is her fault? This Ram created a real drama. I had told Bhai Sahab not to keep this girl back, but he did not listen to me. Earlier the neighbors used to talk, now the relatives will talk. Whatever was left of our respect is gone. What should I do with the food now? There is so much left, how do I know? I am not able to understand anything. Distribute the food among the people.  It is better that someone will eat it than getting spoilt. How will I share it with them [Music] What will the people say about the food? She has no respect for herself. She also gave us a role along with her. Do this. Get the food taken away and give it to the orphanage. At least it is better that someone eat it than getting spoilt. [Music] Where has my life come to this? Don't say anything about my mother. The person who married me out of love. I have no life without my mother. He doesn't say anything about the atrocities committed by his mother. Cheating is in your nature. You belong to no one. Tell everyone, my mother. Why have you people bent upon making my life a disaster? Marry her to the person with whom she eloped and save your respect. It will be much better for you people. Brother, they must have thought that there is still time. Put the sins of others on someone else's head. Now it is obvious that she has run away from home for so many days, so she has done a lot [Praise] What must have happened? Why were you saying to you that you will marry me. How did this thought even come to your mind? Tell me, what happened?  Gaya Afnan we love me, if we don't marry me then whom will we marry, what happened to you, if you laughed twice and talked to me then it means that I will marry you, you did n't laugh twice and talk to me, you always took care of me and this is not friendship, you have worried about me and saved me from trouble, I have only and only sympathized with you, I thought that she is a stupid girl who might need my guidance and if I can guide her by making her a good friend and save her from bad people then this was not love, it does not mean that I want to marry you [sangeet], this marriage cannot happen [sangeet] but but why, we were the only people who met you for cheating and deceit, what are you saying, I am right, hey, you people look like very noble and simple people and your actions are like this, for this runaway girl of yours you found my own son [sangeet], my daughter made a mistake in her innocence, it is nothing like what you are thinking, please come here with me  Let's sit aside and talk, I can't have any conversation with you people now A person who lies once, lies again and again later on You people are not trustworthy [Music] [Music] Stay [Music] I had committed a huge mistake, do n't punish me so badly, it's a mistake, you are calling your crime a mistake, with whom did you elope I say, get her married to the person with whom she eloped and save your respect It will be much better for you people, hey, now I understand why these people were in a hurry for the marriage, hey brother, they must have thought that there is still time, put the sins of others on someone else's head, now it is obvious that if she has run away from home for so many days, she must have done a lot, I don't know how many things I am not shameless like you people, if my daughter had gone somewhere, I would not have allowed her to come back home, I got betrayed by my lover, I lost my heart as well, I lost my life as well, this is what I got [Music] [Prashansa] [Music] Kosla, we were the ones who found you for deception and fraud Hey, you all look like very noble and simple people, but your actions are like this You found my son for this eloped daughter [Music] [Music] I am ready to live as the daughter of your house Aunty, I will not express any wish, I will do whatever you all say, but Aunty, please don't end the relationship, please I am folding my hands in front of you Aunty, in fact I am falling at your feet Aunty, please please do n't end this relationship, my father has lost his life because of me Aunty, please don't end the relationship and accept me [Music] [ Praise] Aunty [Music] [Praise] [Music] [ Praise] Look Bhai sahab, why have you lowered your eyes, just see what kind of clothes your daughter is wearing, girls from respectable families wear such clothes, and if I had known about your daughter's deeds, I would never have brought this proposal in front of the whole world  You people have made a drama of us. Now I understand why these people were in a hurry for the marriage. Brother, they must have thought that there is still time, put the blame of others on someone else. Now it is obvious that she has run away from home for so many days, so she has done a lot [Music] Sajid. Hey, you are still sitting here, go inside and take rest. Otherwise your health will deteriorate further. Sajid Baya Sajid Sajid what happened to you Sajid. Hey Salma Akbar, come quickly, see what has happened to your brother. Well, Sajid. Hey, look what has happened to your brother, brother, brother open your eyes, get up, get up brother, what happened? Open your eyes, Shani Shani, get up, come to your senses, brother, Abba, quickly bring the ambulance, bring the ambulance, quickly [Music] Get up, Abbuji, Abbuji, what am I, don't touch me, don't touch my brother. After doing everything, you are asking what happened. You left no stone unturned in killing your father. Remember, Ram Shah, if anything happens to my brother, I will not spare you, I will kill you, brother. Get up, get up, brother, cause harm.  Get up, get up, bye, the ambulance is coming. Have courage brother, have courage Salma Jalma, for God's sake, take me with you. I will also go with you, Bhabhi, be patient. Don't worry, your health will worsen. I am going to the hospital and I will treat you however you are. Do n't worry, take care of yourself. Allah, Allah, have mercy on me. Malik, go behind me, don't touch me. You have not left this house, but I feel that you will take your last breath only after seeing off the funerals of both of us. Oh Allah, what mistake did I commit, I have committed a huge sin. Sir, you brought this medicine for me. Yes, yes, ok, Shani, it will work. You have the money, right? Hey Bhabhi, why did you people come? Sajid Bhai's health is better now. He has also been shifted to the ward. No, until I see Sajid with my own eyes, my heart will not be at peace. I want to meet Sajid. Salma, you take Bhabhi and get her to meet Bhai Saheb. Okay, fine, but the doctor will not allow two visitors. So, rum, son, you later  I will go Bhabhi, you come with me, why have you come? You have come to meet Abbu ji, you have come to see him, no one else is responsible for the condition in which my brother has been put today. You should also ask her, Allah has given you a daughter, beware, beware, the one who took my daughter's name with his impure tongue, my daughter is not like you, then you should thank Allah that Allah has not given you a daughter like me [Music] If you do n't thank me now, then I do n't know when you will do it again [ Music] Ramcha son, now go and meet Saaj Bhai [Music] [Music] Well, you know how I am tolerating this girl [Music] I am Salma, the thing is that the doctors have clearly said that both the walls of Bhai sahib are closed and plastic will have to be done, yes, then an operation will have to be done, secondly no one is wanting it, even I know that an operation will have to be done, but how, from where will such a huge amount come for the operation [Music] Bhai sahib does not have anything, he has already spent all the savings on his daughter's marriage [Music] Look, my brother, I wish that Allah gives him  You can give me health but it is not in my power to arrange for such a huge amount at once. Believe me, my brain is bursting with the thought, my veins are bursting, it seems as if I should do something before them, I should repent. There is so much problem at home, do n't utter such words, when the situation at home is like this, even words are not good. [Music] Look, you do one thing, ask Bhabhi Sahiba clearly, what do you have to do, where will the music come from, ask her clearly, Anwar Bhabhi is already very worried because of Sajid Bhai's health, his blood pressure is also high, in such a situation, should I tell her about the money, Khudana Khalsa, if something happens to him, then no, you you, what else should I think, you tell me, I will think about what you say, if you have any other solution, if you have money, then bring it, bring it [Music] We have got into trouble without any reason [Music] Neck [Music] [Praise] [Music] [Praise] [ Music] Amma, where are those jewellery kept, keep it in the cupboard, son [Music] Hey Rum what are you doing and why are you taking out these jewellery [Music] Hey I am going to give these jewellery to Chachu [Music] That's why Abu's treatment needs money but beta this jewellery was made by your Abu for your marriage [Music] I don't think you will ever get married so you should leave this matter aside now what are you saying beta you always explained to me and today why are you saying such sad things I am not sad Amma I am just a little tired and anyway you see when Abbu ji gets well we will make it again right now he needs treatment that's why I had to give it to Chachu yes Anwar was saying that your Abbu's health is just a little bad there is a slight pain in the chest and the doctor has said that he will be discharged after two-four days this is what he had said from the hospital naane yes yes Amma it is like this Abu ji is absolutely fine he just needs treatment Abu will get completely well you just pray for him [Music] [Music] [Music] I got cheated by my friend
