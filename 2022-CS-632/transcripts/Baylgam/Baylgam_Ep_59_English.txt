Come in. Sir, Mr. Ahmad is here, I have seated him in
the conference room. You do one thing, tell him that the meeting today
has been canceled, we will reschedule it. but sir you are the one who gave
Mr. Ahmad time for 4 pm, and we are trying to do this
meeting for so long. We finalized this meeting
with sir Ahmad with difficulty. You apologize to him on my behalf and tell him that I had something urgent to do,
so I had to go. Leave. Fine, sir. Afnan, what are you doing here? I came to get you to go with me. I am not going anywhere,
you leave from here. Really? You were sitting here
focused on your work, and look at me, I didn’t do any work since morning, I was not talking to anyone, I didn’t want to do anything. To the extent that I canceled
such an important meeting and I came here. Now come with me. I told you, I am not going anywhere. If you don’t agree, then I will hold your
hand and take you. Have you lost your mind, Afnan? I told you I am not going anywhere, you please go from here. I will not go from this
office till you agree, that’s it. You realized really soon to convince me. You cannot convince me at home, now you came to my
office to convince me. Please, Afnan, there are other people in the office too. Don’t create a scene. Leave from here. Afnan, you are so stubborn. Thank you. I know. I know, I am really stubborn. I am saying something to you. That’s why I am asking you, so agree. Look, I too am really smart. I knew if I tried to convince you at home you would never have agreed, that is why I came to the
office to convince you, because no matter how angry you get , you will not be able to take it out on me. Come on, enough now. Wrap up everything and come with me. We are going. First we will go for lunch and then on a long drive after that. What are you looking at? You know well, till you don’t agree to me, you will not get rid of me. Come on, man. Let’s go for lunch. Okay fine, I accept, now you leave from here. Okay lets do one thing, I will drop you at your office, okay? I will talk to my boss. Ramsha. Ramsha. Greetings. Greetings. Should I bring water? No, no, I had water. Then should I make tea? No. No. I had brought something. Who did you bring this for? Mama is not in the age to wear this, I will never bring this for Annie. That leaves papa and me, this is of no use for us. So then say it straight
that you got it for me. What is the need to
beat about the bush? it is not necessary that
you say everything, understand some things
just like that. Okay, don’t be mistaken. Understand? I met a child on the way, he told me to take it. He forced me, so I brought it. Now wear it, and stop smiling, okay? Serve food, I am coming. Listen. Now if you have brought it,
then put it on too. Please. Okay. Now show me the other one. Yes. It looks good. Thank you. Food. Wow. Who brought this? Who can bring it? Brother? Wow. For me he didn’t even bring a rose petal,
rose is out of question. Garlands for his wife. Okay stop it. Shani is hungry,
I will go serve food. Hmmm. Blushing. Blushing. Yes, yes, doctor, I don’t understand,
what should we do? Dad has not taken
his medication on time, so his health is not getting better. If you want we can
admit to the hospital, we want that he gets
the best treatment. Yes, yes, you whatsapp it to me. Do send it. Sure. Sure. Sure. Okay. Okay. Goodbye. What is the matter Afnan? How is brother doing? I have been noticing
for a few days, Afnan, he has a really tired
look on his face. I told him, that I will take him to the
hospital, but no, he doesn’t listen to me. Aunt, since Ramsha
left from here, he has stopped eating. He doesn’t take his
medication on time. Earlier, Ramsha would force him and give him the
medication on time. His health has improved but now it has suddenly
started deteriorating. Now you, me and Alizay
are so busy in our work, so we are unable to
give dad time. Yes obviously, Ramsha had
a lot of free time, so she had nothing to do, so she would take
good care of brother, but now what can we do? Aunt, do one thing, call Ramsha. Ask her that dad is
really missing her, she should come
and meet him. Okay I will call her. By the way, what
is brother doing? Is he in his room? Yes. How are you feeling now? You know, you look really
weak from earlier. I am better since earlier. I got a little unwell in the morning, I wanted to see Ramsha.
It is good that you people came. You are not caring for
your health at all, right? You must not have taken your
medication on time, that’s why you got unwell. Hey, what do they say? Whatever happens is for better. Now I got unwell so you
came hearing about it, or else when would
you have come. And now see, there is
no one in my room and now see it is so lively. Uncle, you are too much. You know someone has
said it correctly, that when a person gets old, they act like a child. You made me old and also a child. Son, you sit. Come. No. mama, I think
we should leave now. Ramsha, come on,
I have some work. We will go now. If you don’t mind, then can Ramsha stay with
us for two to four days? Brother will become happy and he will get a little better too. Yes, we have… We have no objection. You… Ask Ramsha. Ramsha, child, if you want to stay with
brother Qasim for a few days, then… What do you say, child, Ramsha? Huh? Fine, I will stay here. I will just come. I will come, you people sit and talk. If you don’t like me staying here, then I will say no to uncle. I will not stay here. But you don’t get upset. Ramsha, you don’t worry. I just wanted that you stay for a day or two,
then come back. you are not upset? Why would I mind it? I left the room because
my friend was calling, I had to talk to him about
something important. Okay, I thought you didn’t like it, that is
why you came from the room. That is why I came after you. Okay fine, I will tell uncle
that I am staying here. He will like it. Ramsha. Ramsha, make tea. Brother, you are calling out to Ramsha, you dropped her at
Mr. Qasim’s home yourself. Oh yes, I forgot. I feel I have gotten used to her. Hmmm… maybe you don’t call it getting used
to someone, it is called love. Bring tea. Come on. Okay, I will bring tea. It was poor Ramsha’s courage that she sat with you all night long. She kept on cold compress
on your forehead all night long in this condition. She sat with you all night long
and took care of you. That is why you are
sitting fine over here. Me and your papa had gone to sleep
after giving you medication. That poor thing
showed the strength. That girl stayed up because
of you all night long. I don’t know what you are saying. Yes, how would you know. You had such high fever. You were suffering from high fever. But that girl sat with you all night
long because of you, even in this condition and Shani, only lucky people get such wives. Know her worth.
Know her worth. Mama, why did you
stop Ramsha here? You know I don’t like
her staying in this home. So Alizay, what do I do? You know that Bina’s daughter’s
wedding functions have started, I have not gone to
a single function. She is so upset with me. You have no issues, you come so late from the office. You know nothing about
what is happening at home. I have to take care of
everything at home. This is why I have
kept Ramsha here, that at least I will
attend the functions. Even brother is not well. Now after all, you have started
to come later than earlier. You don’t know about the
home or care for brother. Mama, I had told you, a new project of mine has started. I am really busy in that. My boss has put the entire
responsibility for it on me. So why are you doing this? And your boss has put all
the responsibility on you. Mama, you should be proud of me. I am doing such good work You come to my office some time and
see how much respect I have. But you are concerned as to why
I don’t work at home. Anyway, before you leave ask
how brother is and also give him his medication. I am really tired right now. Tell Ramsha, she will
give uncle his medication. And when I go to the
office in the morning, I will meet uncle and go. Goodnight. Thank God I stopped Ramsha, this girl doesn’t care about the home. Anyway, it is my fault, I should have put the responsibilities
of the home on her earlier. Yes, greetings. Yes, greetings. Where are you? I am at uncle’s home. I just gave him his medication, so he went to sleep. What happened? Tell me. Yes, I couldn’t find a few things of mine, that is why I called you. Which things? I had a blue shirt, I cannot find it. But anyway, don’t worry, I will find it. Okay. Fine. Goodbye. What happened? Are you disconnecting the phone? Yes. Why? Do you want to say something? No. that…yes. Yes. What do you mean, Shani? What no, yes? What do you want to say? Are you fine? Are you feeling okay? Hello. Shani? Yes. Yes, I am listening. Go ahead. I am asking you something. Are you fine? Yes, yes, I am absolutely fine. When will you come? I will come when you tell me to. Then I will come right now. What? Yes. I mean that, see, you are worried there too, you are not well. You will have issues sitting
and getting up and I am also a little worried here, I cannot find my things. So I will come. Yes, but who told you that
I am worried here? I am absolutely fine. I didn’t come to stay at uncle’s
home for the first time, I have spent a long time here, so you stop worrying about me. Yes, but if you cannot
focus there and you want that I come
there, then say that. No, no, nothing like that. I am able to focus,
I can focus well. In fact, there is a lot
of peace in the room and I will sleep peacefully
in the room today. Okay, then sleep peacefully. Goodbye. Goodbye. Ramsha, you know everything. You know it all, still you do this with me. Tabassum, if you cut the fruit,
then bring it. Oh wow, brother, it is really good, that you are having fruit in breakfast. No, not for myself, I got the fruit cut for Ramsha. When you have this fruit, it is good for you, okay? It has vitamins and it doesn’t
have artificial sugar either. This is the opposite thing uncle. I have come here to care for you and you are caring for me. Live long. You did good that you came here. You must work at home all the time. When would you pay
attention to yourself. Now when you stay here, you will get time to focus on yourself. Eat well and take care of yourself and all of us will also care for you. Right, Afsheen? Yes, yes, you are right. There is nothing like that uncle. Everyone at home
really cares for me, aunt really worries for me
and cares for me, in fact, now even Shani
has gotten better, he takes a lot of care of me, and Annie? Annie doesn’t let me do
any work at home. Have breakfast properly. You have to finish this bowl yourself, come on. Yes. Live long. Aunty, you have some. What is this? One minute. One minute. What are you doing? Pick it up again. Well done. Look, you got unwell today. The blood pressure shouldn’t
get low in this condition. Tell me, what have you
eaten since morning? Some fruit, some juices,
a person has this that’s when they stay fine. Come on finish it. Afnan, I am absolutely fine,
you don’t worry. You get unwell in this condition, the BP gets low. It is nothing normal and
this shouldn’t happen. You have to care for yourself
a lot in this condition… hey, when did you come? Why are you standing there?
Come inside. I just came from the office. I didn’t know when you came. How would you know? All your attention is
towards Ramsha. Greetings. Yes, aunt. Hello. I cannot hear you. I will go out and talk to you. Hello. Yes. I feel you started serving Ramsha 
as soon as you came from the office. You didn’t even change your clothes. Yes, I didn’t change. I didn’t get the chance. I found out Ramsha is unwell, so I came here to ask how she is. You are really worried for Ramsha. What do you mean? 
What do you want to say? That you never cared
 so much for me, Afnan. You are not in this condition either. And even if I came and asked her 
how she was in this condition, then no hell broke loose. I think you too should care for her health along with me. Right now she needs care. What happened now? I feel Ramsha is the real niece of uncle, not me. He wants to form a relation with him. Alizay, I am noticing since Ramsha came to this home, you are really disturbed cause of her. Mama, have you not seen how 
Afnan goes around Ramsha. My husband’s ex-lover
 is sitting in this home and I shouldn’t even 
be mentally disturbed? Alizay, you forget those things. Why don’t you understand that Ramsha was his past. You are Afnan’s present and future. Look my love if you remain stuck in these things, how will you move on? Mama, Afnan still has 
Ramsha in her heart today. Did you forget what 
Fahad told us how Ramsha was after Afnan. Ramsha is not as we 
see her today. Trapping rich boys by using media
 and social media and then trapping them in her love
 and using them for her benefit. This is something these
 girls can do easily. Ramsha can go to any extent. Alizay, stop this nonsense. I know Afnan well, 
he is not like that at all. If you keep on thinking 
these things, then your life will become poison. My life has become poison, mama. I did love Afnan, but I didn’t commit a sin. This  is one truth and the second truth is that I have no place for
 Afnan in my heart. Did you hear it? And I think you should
 believe it too. If you want to believe her,
 then do it. I don’t believe anything she says. Ramsha. What happened? 
Why are you crying? Ramsha, tell me, 
what happened? Did someone say
 something to you? Ramsha. What happened, child? Nothing uncle, I just want to go home. These tears in your eyes. 
Why are you crying? Look Ramsha, child, I will not 
let you go like this at all. Nothing happened uncle. I just want to go home. Then is this not your home? The homes are made with parents. I don’t have parents now. That is why I have no 
home in this world. No matter how much 
you call me your daughter, but saying it doesn’t make 
me your real daughter. This world doesn’t know
 the place you hold in my heart. I wish I could open 
my heart and show to everyone the place you hold 
in my heart, uncle. I feel something is left
 lacking in my care, that is why you care more
 for people, and not me. The lacking is not in your care, 
it is in my character. The thorns I have sowed 
in the past are still pinching me today. I don’t know how long 
they will continue to pinch me. I wish I had controlled 
my untamed wishes, then character would 
have been stainless like my heart. Child, what had to happen
 has happened. You tell me, what has happened? 
Did someone say something? Did Afsheen say 
something to you? Tell me. Did someone say something… did Alizay say something to you? Huh?
