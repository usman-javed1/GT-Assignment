I am satisfied, there is just a burden on my heart, I just want to ease the burden 
from my heart. Dad, tell me what are you 
trying to say? I will do as you say,
 I am saying it to you, I will do whatever you say. Afnan, I... I am handing over Ramsha to you, Have fear of God when it comes 
to that girl, If God forbid something 
happens to her, I will hold you responsible on the day
 of judgment. From now onwards I am going to do 
exactly what you are saying, you, nothing is happening to you, 
you are absolutely fine, you will see how you get absolutely well 
by God’s will, don’t say such things. Just take care of her. Yes, dad, I promise you, 
I will take care of Ramsha. Hmm, you have satisfied me. “I bear witness that there is 
no deity but Allah, and I bear witness that 
Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.” Doctor? Doctor? Dad? Dad? Doctor? Uncle, see, I have picked up
flowers for you from the lawn outside.” Surely to God, we belong 
and to Him we will all return.” Oh God, I am content with your decision. What was the need for you to become 
the president of the mosque committee? You already have so many 
responsibilities and now this, you are just wasting your time 
for no reason. I am not wasting time but saving it, this time and these minor serving will be 
beneficial for me in the world hereafter, I just hope God accepts it. What is this? Why do you have 
tears in your eyes? No, no, it is not because of you. I know dad, I know you have been really hurt 
because of what we said but you have misunderstood 
what we said, dad. That is not what we meant, we were just trying to say that 
whatever you are doing is a lot. Okay. Afnan, do you know when we ask 
something from God we want him to give us the best 
and the most when it's time to spend in his way 
or for him we think less is more. You work day and night 
for worldly tasks, you don’t care if it is day or night, you just exhaust yourself and 
when God calls you, you get tired. Dad, now if I have to expand 
the business, I will have to work this hard. 
Hmm. You know a lot about worldly business,
you know it very well, try trading with God as well, it doesn’t just have benefits 
but salvation too. Afnan, do you know when we walk 
the path of God he gives us way more rewards, and do remember that there is no salvation 
in the way of success, but there is a bit of success 
in the way of salvation. We first tried to correct myself, 
and then tried to correct you as well. After your mother’s demise, I have fulfilled the responsibility of 
a Father with full sincerity and honesty. Afnan? So much, a person gets so helpless when in front of his own eyes, his own eyes, his own father… I wish, Ramsha, I wish that the time just rewinds once 
and I can go to my father. Have patience Afnan. Uncle has this much life written, he was a very special man of God
so God called him. Have patience, have patience. Brother Qasim was a very pious man, he was able to recite the Kalimah 
at the time of his demise, God gives this opportunity only 
to his fortunate men. He always used to help everyone, I have not seen a more kind-hearted 
man like him in this neighborhood. He never ever missed any 
of his prayers. I have informed about the demise 
of Mr Qasim in the mosque, May God give you patience. You guys just remember us 
in your prayers. My brother left me, my father like brother left, he left me. Despite of being a widow 
I have never felt so lonely, as much as I do after my brother left. My brother was my life, how will I live now? My brother left me. Mom, be strong. Mom? My brother left me. Control yourself. 
Have patience Mom. Why have you come here? You are here to see our hardships, 
our pain and problems. So now watch, watch and be happy. Afsheen, who is she? She is the one, she is the cursed girl because of 
whom my brother left. Because of you my brother had 
a heart attack today, if you hadn’t run away 
from this house, my brother would have left me today. You cheap girl, who used to live in small streets, who doesn’t have any character, my brother brought her to his house
and gave her respect, he fulfilled all your wishes, he made you equal to my daughter, he took such good care of you but you, you don’t deserve to be respected. Get lost from this house. You are insulting me. Insult? First, be worthy of the respect. We all know what were you? And not just us the whole world 
knows it. I won’t tolerate you in my house
 even for a minute. Get out of here. Aunt, what are you doing? What is wrong with you? 
Afnan, don’t interfere, I won’t tolerate her even for 
a minute in this house. Aunt, this is not the time to talk about
 all this, please don’t do this, please. No Afnan, because of him, my brother left me, 
I won’t leave her. Aunt, Aunt please. 
Mom. Everyone is watching, 
why are you putting up a show? If it was for me I would have 
given her to the police. It is my generosity that I am not saying
anything to her. Afnan, how can you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this house? Tell me. 
Get her out of this house. Mom. 
Aunt, get back to your senses! You are not providing peace 
to Dad’s soul by doing all this, you are causing him pain instead.
 Please. You, you go in your room. Go. My brother left me. Everything is over Alizey. Mom, please, have patience. 
Everything is over. Madam Ramsha, have tea, your headache will get better 
and you will feel light too. I don’t feel like having anything, take it away from here. Did they bring uncle? No, he has been kept in the Morgue. Why in the Morgue? actually, his cousin brother is coming 
from America so he will get here tomorrow evening,
funeral will be done then. And what if he doesn’t get here 
by tomorrow evening? So then the funeral might happen 
day after tomorrow. Day after tomorrow? It means that they will keep Uncle
in the morgue till day after tomorrow? Where is Afnan? I will have to talk to Afnan. Madam? This is not possible, they cannot cause so much pain 
to Uncle, I will have to talk to Afnan. Madam, you should leave the room, Madam has created a huge scene
 because of you right now and she will get angrier and even Mr Afnan won’t listen 
to you and get angry. I am asking you 
where is Afnan right now? Some people are here to meet him,
he is in the drawing room. Madam Ramsha, 
don’t go there. I can’t let Uncle be in pain 
to save myself from pain. He has done a lot of favors on me, 
let me do something for him as well. Madam Ramsha? Thank you so much for coming. 
Mr Muslim Scholar, dad had a lot of love and 
respect towards you. You came here and prayed for him, his soul must have been in peace. Indeed, Indeed. Son, Mr Qasim was an extremely 
loving person. Not just me he used to love everyone and he had taken so much 
responsibility of the Mosque work. May God grants him the reward of it. Amen. Afnan, I want to talk to you. Mr Muslim Scholar, 
come, you come. Mr Muslim Scholar, come. Afnan, why are you keeping Uncle
 in the Morgue? That too, just because of a relative? it is not your concern, 
don’t interfere in it. I Know it is not my concern but do you know keeping a dead body in the Morgue
for two days, just so a relative can fulfill the wish 
of seeing him for one last time will cause so much pain to Uncle. Why do you guys not understand this, for the sake of your own relief 
you cause pain to someone else. What kind of love is this? When a person dies, we should bury them 
as soon as possible. So please try to understand 
what I am saying and don’t keep Uncle in the Morgue, it will cause him pain. Afnan, son, this girl is absolutely right. It is not okay to delay the funeral of 
Mr Qasim for any relative or anything. Son, I suggest you listen to what the girl is saying and do the funeral soon, that is better for the dead and 
we will get rewarded too. Okay Mr Muslim Scholar. You make an announcement 
in the Mosque that the funeral prayers 
at the time of Asr today. If God wills. I won’t tolerate you in my house 
even for a minute. Get out of here. Aunt, what are you doing? What is wrong with you? 
Afnan, don’t interfere, I won’t tolerate her even for a minute 
in this house. Aunt, this is not the time to talk about 
all this, please don’t do this, please. No Afnan, because of him, my brother left me,
I won’t leave her. Aunt, Aunt please. 
Mom. Everyone is watching, 
why are you putting up a show? If it was for me I would have 
given her to the police. It is my generosity that I am not saying 
anything to her. Afnan, how can you tolerate the murderer
of your father in this house? Tell me. Get her out of this house. Mom. 
Aunt, get back to your senses! You are not providing peace 
to Dad’s soul by doing all this, you are causing him pain instead. Mom, why aren’t you coming 
for breakfast? Alizey, I am thinking something. Even after so much has happened, why isn’t Afnan getting Ramsha 
out of this house? Mom, leave all this, everything will be done, 
come let’s have breakfast. Alizey, how can you say this with 
so much satisfaction? because I have seen hatred and 
anger in Afnan’s eyes for Ramsha. And you know that when hatred and anger 
come together, it makes the person’s brain 
to stop working, you just wait and watch, Afnan will get Ramsha out of 
this house himself in a few days. Come, let’s have breakfast. 
Come. Hey, come, come. Greetings. These are some clothes and 
the things you may need, yeah? Hey Uncle, what was the need 
for all this? You are worrying for me
for no reason. What is there to worry about and don’t call me Uncle, call me Uncle like Alizey do, I have made your mom my sister only. Okay, I will try, Uncle. 
Hey, Uncle again? Okay Uncle. Stay blessed, stay blessed. Check these things, 
you will like them. My child, I admit it was my mistake. 
You haven’t made any mistake, no matter you admit or not, 
I won’t get my mother back, will you make up for my loss? No, right? My loss won’t be made up
and mother won’t come back, no right? You have killed my mother, You killed my mother, 
you are a murderer, you are a murderer, 
you have murdered. Just shut up. How are you talking to my Dad? I am abolsutely right, 
your father killed my mother. Why are you looking like that, 
my child? I am looking that I misbehaved so much with you, said you so many wrong things and called you the murderer 
of my mother and in return you, you are treating me so politely, you didn’t ask me to leave the house but calling me to eat, why? Because I am afraid of God. Uncle, soup. Give it to me, I will feed him. 
Let it be, give it to me, I will have it myself. Okay dad. In The name of God the most 
gracious and merciful. Hmmm, wow the soup is amazing. My child, now if I get ill again, 
make the same soup again. Umm Uncle, God forbid you
 get ill again. And you don’t have to get ill 
to have this soup, I will make it for you 
whenever you ask me to. Hey I will have to get ill to have 
this amazing soup. Do you know when the doctor came and 
stayed quiet for a long time, we all got so scared, Thank God, you are absolutely fine, 
Uncle. Ramsha, my child, God doesn’t burden a soul 
more than they can handle. Look, I am perfectly fine 
in front of you, why are you crying for no reason? You are not well at all, 
look at your condition, you are hyperventilating 
just by talking a little, listen to me uncle, you have to take good care 
of yourself now and wait I will call the doctor. No, you won’t go anywhere, Afnan has gone to talk to the doctor, 
you come sit here. I beg you don’t turn your back at me, forgive me, trust me. My child, I trust you, I trust you more than myself, Ramsha, you didn’t lie to me, Alizey and Afsheen will stoop so low, 
I could have never thought that, they have been cruel to you, 
they are your culprits. I called you my daughter and I couldn’t even protect you. Uncle, forgive me.
