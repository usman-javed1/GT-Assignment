[23.76] Come in.
[25.64] Sir, Mr. Ahmad is here,
[26.96] I have seated him in
the conference room.
[31.48] You do one thing, tell him that
[34.64] the meeting today
has been canceled,
[36.24] we will reschedule it.
[38.20] but sir you are the one who gave
Mr. Ahmad time for 4 pm,
[40.92] and we are trying to do this
meeting for so long.
[43.40] We finalized this meeting
with sir Ahmad with difficulty.
[45.92] You apologize to him on my behalf
[49.84] and tell him that
[51.16] I had something urgent to do,
so I had to go.
[54.08] Leave.
[55.80] Fine, sir.
[78.40] Afnan, what are you doing here?
[80.52] I came to get you to go with me.
[84.32] I am not going anywhere,
you leave from here.
[87.04] Really?
[88.32] You were sitting here
focused on your work,
[92.76] and look at me,
[94.08] I didn’t do any work since morning,
[96.20] I was not talking to anyone,
[97.44] I didn’t want to do anything.
[101.68] To the extent that I canceled
such an important meeting
[103.84] and I came here. Now come with me.
[106.60] I told you,
[108.28] I am not going anywhere.
[109.84] If you don’t agree,
[111.40] then I will hold your
hand and take you.
[113.20] Have you lost your mind, Afnan?
[115.32] I told you I am not going anywhere,
[116.76] you please go from here.
[118.24] I will not go from this
office till you agree,
[121.40] that’s it.
[123.92] You realized really soon to convince me.
[129.60] You cannot convince me at home,
[131.24] now you came to my
office to convince me.
[139.12] Please, Afnan,
[140.88] there are other people in the office too.
[142.28] Don’t create a scene.
[143.60] Leave from here.
[149.56] Afnan, you are so stubborn.
[151.28] Thank you. I know. I know,
[152.60] I am really stubborn.
[153.68] I am saying something to you.
[155.16] That’s why I am asking you,
[156.60] so agree.
[157.76] Look, I too am really smart.
[159.24] I knew if I tried to convince you at home
[161.80] you would never have agreed,
[167.04] that is why I came to the
office to convince you,
[168.64] because no matter how angry you get ,
[171.36] you will not be able to take it out on me.
[177.48] Come on, enough now.
[178.80] Wrap up everything
[179.76] and come with me. We are going.
[186.16] First we will go for lunch
[188.44] and then on a long drive after that.
[199.88] What are you looking at?
[201.84] You know well,
[204.04] till you don’t agree to me,
[205.68] you will not get rid of me.
[211.76] Come on, man.
[213.20] Let’s go for lunch.
[217.48] Okay fine,
[219.00] I accept,
[220.24] now you leave from here.
[222.08] Okay lets do one thing,
[223.48] I will drop you at your office, okay?
[234.60] I will talk to my boss.
[305.44] Ramsha.
[310.32] Ramsha.
[313.08] Greetings.
[314.56] Greetings.
[315.36] Should I bring water?
[316.56] No, no, I had water.
[318.84] Then should I make tea?
[319.68] No. No.
[321.40] I had brought something.
[333.32] Who did you bring this for?
[337.44] Mama is not in the age to wear this,
[342.00] I will never bring this for Annie.
[345.84] That leaves papa and me,
[348.60] this is of no use for us.
[352.80] So then say it straight
that you got it for me.
[357.72] What is the need to
beat about the bush?
[361.52] it is not necessary that
you say everything,
[364.72] understand some things
just like that.
[378.48] Okay, don’t be mistaken.
[386.16] Understand?
[387.60] I met a child on the way,
[389.20] he told me to take it.
[390.96] He forced me, so I brought it.
[397.32] Now wear it,
[399.00] and stop smiling, okay?
[402.96] Serve food, I am coming.
[404.40] Listen.
[409.04] Now if you have brought it,
then put it on too.
[422.24] Please.
[424.28] Okay.
[449.92] Now show me the other one.
[450.88] Yes.
[472.80] It looks good.
[478.64] Thank you.
[482.28] Food.
[489.00] Wow. Who brought this?
[495.80] Who can bring it?
[498.96] Brother?
[503.88] Wow.
[505.52] For me he didn’t even bring a rose petal,
rose is out of question.
[509.08] Garlands for his wife.
[511.36] Okay stop it.
[512.96] Shani is hungry,
I will go serve food.
[516.60] Hmmm. Blushing. Blushing.
[526.84] Yes, yes, doctor,
[528.56] I don’t understand,
what should we do?
[531.08] Dad has not taken
his medication on time,
[534.08] so his health is not getting better.
[536.60] If you want we can
admit to the hospital,
[540.64] we want that he gets
the best treatment.
[544.08] Yes, yes,
[545.20] you whatsapp it to me.
[547.08] Do send it. Sure. Sure.
[549.68] Sure. Okay. Okay. Goodbye.
[553.24] What is the matter Afnan?
[554.20] How is brother doing?
[556.48] I have been noticing
for a few days, Afnan,
[558.40] he has a really tired
look on his face.
[562.48] I told him, that
[563.84] I will take him to the
hospital, but no,
[566.08] he doesn’t listen to me.
[568.76] Aunt, since Ramsha
left from here,
[576.44] he has stopped eating.
[578.76] He doesn’t take his
medication on time.
[584.48] Earlier, Ramsha would force him
[586.52] and give him the
medication on time.
[592.24] His health has improved
[594.44] but now it has suddenly
started deteriorating.
[601.12] Now you, me and Alizay
are so busy in our work,
[604.88] so we are unable to
give dad time.
[607.40] Yes obviously,
[609.12] Ramsha had
a lot of free time,
[615.32] so she had nothing to do,
[617.56] so she would take
good care of brother,
[619.68] but now what can we do?
[623.64] Aunt, do one thing,
[625.52] call Ramsha.
[629.88] Ask her that dad is
really missing her,
[632.88] she should come
and meet him.
[634.44] Okay I will call her.
[636.08] By the way, what
is brother doing?
[637.56] Is he in his room?
[638.48] Yes.
[654.40] How are you feeling now?
[656.24] You know, you look really
weak from earlier.
[660.24] I am better since earlier.
[662.96] I got a little unwell in the morning,
[665.20] I wanted to see Ramsha.
It is good
[667.64] that you people came.
[669.60] You are not caring for
your health at all, right?
[679.44] You must not have taken your
medication on time,
[680.88] that’s why you got unwell.
[687.04] Hey, what do they say?
[690.00] Whatever happens is for better.
[694.36] Now I got unwell so you
came hearing about it,
[698.00] or else when would
you have come.
[699.96] And now see, there is
no one in my room
[701.84] and now see it is so lively.
[710.12] Uncle, you are too much.
[711.20] You know someone has
said it correctly,
[713.04] that when a person gets old,
[714.44] they act like a child.
[716.80] You made me old and also a child.
[718.84] Son, you sit. Come.
[720.72] No. mama, I think
we should leave now.
[724.12] Ramsha, come on,
I have some work.
[730.88] We will go now.
[732.68] If you don’t mind, then
[736.24] can Ramsha stay with
us for two to four days?
[749.36] Brother will become happy and
[751.12] he will get a little better too.
[762.64] Yes, we have…
[769.56] We have no objection. You…
[777.68] Ask Ramsha.
[778.96] Ramsha, child, if you want to stay with
brother Qasim for a few days, then…
[790.60] What do you say, child, Ramsha? Huh?
[808.52] Fine, I will stay here.
[823.84] I will just come.
[832.00] I will come, you people sit and talk.
[853.28] If you don’t like me staying here,
[855.16] then I will say no to uncle.
[856.96] I will not stay here.
[858.60] But you don’t get upset.
[864.20] Ramsha, you don’t worry.
[867.84] I just wanted that
[870.64] you stay for a day or two,
then come back.
[874.72] you are not upset?
[879.44] Why would I mind it?
[881.32] I left the room because
my friend was calling,
[884.96] I had to talk to him about
something important.
[886.92] Okay,
[888.08] I thought you didn’t like it, that is
why you came from the room.
[893.76] That is why I came after you.
[895.56] Okay fine, I will tell uncle
that I am staying here.
[898.68] He will like it.
[917.68] Ramsha. Ramsha, make tea.
[923.64] Brother,
[925.20] you are calling out to Ramsha,
[927.96] you dropped her at
Mr. Qasim’s home yourself.
[931.92] Oh yes,
[937.52] I forgot.
[941.04] I feel I have gotten used to her.
[944.72] Hmmm…
[945.72] maybe you don’t call it getting used
to someone, it is called love.
[956.68] Bring tea. Come on.
[959.16] Okay, I will bring tea.
[967.60] It was poor Ramsha’s courage that
[969.60] she sat with you all night long.
[971.88] She kept on cold compress
on your forehead
[974.60] all night long in this condition.
[975.12] She sat with you all night long
and took care of you.
[978.68] That is why you are
sitting fine over here.
[982.88] Me and your papa had gone to sleep
after giving you medication.
[987.76] That poor thing
showed the strength.
[989.44] That girl stayed up because
of you all night long.
[995.08] I don’t know what you are saying.
[996.76] Yes, how would you know.
[998.20] You had such high fever.
[1000.40] You were suffering from high fever.
[1003.04] But that girl
[1004.40] sat with you all night
long because of you,
[1007.08] even in this condition
[1008.08] and Shani,
[1009.64] only lucky people get such wives.
[1015.00] Know her worth.
Know her worth.
[1045.12] Mama, why did you
stop Ramsha here?
[1047.00] You know I don’t like
her staying in this home.
[1050.08] So Alizay, what do I do?
[1055.00] You know that Bina’s daughter’s
wedding functions have started,
[1058.92] I have not gone to
a single function.
[1064.64] She is so upset with me.
[1066.72] You have no issues,
[1067.84] you come so late from the office.
[1073.00] You know nothing about
what is happening at home.
[1075.36] I have to take care of
everything at home.
[1080.92] This is why I have
kept Ramsha here,
[1083.56] that at least I will
attend the functions.
[1085.80] Even brother is not well.
[1088.36] Now after all, you have started
to come later than earlier.
[1091.68] You don’t know about the
home or care for brother.
[1097.36] Mama, I had told you,
[1100.24] a new project of mine has started.
[1102.88] I am really busy in that.
[1104.56] My boss has put the entire
responsibility for it on me.
[1107.96] So why are you doing this?
[1109.72] And your boss has put all
the responsibility on you.
[1114.32] Mama, you should be proud of me.
[1117.64] I am doing such good work
[1119.76] You come to my office some time and
see how much respect I have.
[1122.52] But you are concerned as to why
I don’t work at home.
[1125.52] Anyway,
[1126.40] before you leave ask
how brother is and
[1129.40] also give him his medication.
[1134.16] I am really tired right now.
[1138.96] Tell Ramsha, she will
give uncle his medication.
[1141.80] And when I go to the
office in the morning,
[1143.16] I will meet uncle and go.
[1146.12] Goodnight.
[1150.08] Thank God I stopped Ramsha,
[1153.68] this girl doesn’t care about the home.
[1157.08] Anyway, it is my fault,
[1159.00] I should have put the responsibilities
of the home on her earlier.
[1268.48] Yes, greetings.
[1269.60] Yes, greetings.
[1272.04] Where are you?
[1273.04] I am at uncle’s home.
[1274.64] I just gave him his medication,
[1276.00] so he went to sleep.
[1276.96] What happened? Tell me.
[1277.76] Yes,
[1279.48] I couldn’t find a few things of mine,
[1281.64] that is why I called you.
[1286.40] Which things?
[1287.20] I had a blue shirt, I cannot find it.
[1292.32] But anyway, don’t worry, I will find it.
[1298.32] Okay. Fine. Goodbye.
[1303.56] What happened?
[1304.16] Are you disconnecting the phone?
[1306.52] Yes. Why?
[1308.56] Do you want to say something?
[1310.48] No.
[1314.64] that…yes. Yes.
[1318.24] What do you mean, Shani?
[1320.32] What no, yes?
[1322.40] What do you want to say?
[1323.76] Are you fine? Are you feeling okay?
[1335.08] Hello. Shani?
[1336.88] Yes. Yes, I am listening. Go ahead.
[1339.92] I am asking you something.
[1341.76] Are you fine?
[1343.28] Yes, yes, I am absolutely fine.
[1345.24] When will you come?
[1348.28] I will come when you tell me to.
[1351.28] Then I will come right now.
[1354.76] What?
[1355.76] Yes. I mean that,
[1358.88] see, you are worried there too,
[1360.76] you are not well.
[1362.68] You will have issues sitting
and getting up and
[1364.84] I am also a little worried here,
[1367.12] I cannot find my things.
[1368.28] So I will come.
[1372.52] Yes, but who told you that
I am worried here?
[1379.40] I am absolutely fine.
[1380.80] I didn’t come to stay at uncle’s
home for the first time,
[1383.96] I have spent a long time here,
[1386.24] so you stop worrying about me.
[1389.64] Yes, but if you cannot
focus there and
[1392.96] you want that I come
there, then say that.
[1397.36] No, no, nothing like that.
[1401.28] I am able to focus,
I can focus well.
[1404.32] In fact, there is a lot
of peace in the room
[1408.28] and I will sleep peacefully
in the room today.
[1411.60] Okay, then sleep peacefully.
[1416.92] Goodbye.
[1419.56] Goodbye.
[1441.52] Ramsha, you know everything.
[1444.52] You know it all, still you do this with me.
[1535.08] Tabassum, if you cut the fruit,
then bring it.
[1538.40] Oh wow, brother,
[1539.76] it is really good, that
[1541.76] you are having fruit in breakfast.
[1544.92] No, not for myself,
[1547.64] I got the fruit cut for Ramsha.
[1561.44] When you have this fruit,
[1562.80] it is good for you, okay?
[1564.88] It has vitamins and it doesn’t
have artificial sugar either.
[1571.24] This is the opposite thing uncle.
[1573.08] I have come here to care for you and
[1574.64] you are caring for me.
[1578.04] Live long.
[1580.12] You did good that you came here.
[1582.36] You must work at home all the time.
[1584.44] When would you pay
attention to yourself.
[1589.96] Now when you stay here,
[1591.28] you will get time to focus on yourself.
[1593.48] Eat well and take care of yourself
[1595.28] and all of us will also care for you.
[1596.68] Right, Afsheen?
[1597.64] Yes, yes, you are right.
[1601.08] There is nothing like that uncle.
[1602.88] Everyone at home
really cares for me,
[1604.84] aunt really worries for me
and cares for me,
[1607.44] in fact, now even Shani
has gotten better,
[1609.64] he takes a lot of care of me,
[1613.48] and Annie?
[1614.36] Annie doesn’t let me do
any work at home.
[1619.92] Have breakfast properly.
[1621.20] You have to finish this bowl yourself,
[1622.56] come on.
[1624.12] Yes.
[1624.92] Live long.
[1625.44] Aunty, you have some.
[1643.72] What is this? One minute. One minute.
[1645.16] What are you doing?
[1646.16] Pick it up again.
[1647.44] Well done.
[1648.64] Look, you got unwell today.
[1651.32] The blood pressure shouldn’t
get low in this condition.
[1654.04] Tell me, what have you
eaten since morning?
[1656.28] Some fruit, some juices,
a person has this
[1660.36] that’s when they stay fine.
[1661.84] Come on finish it.
[1663.92] Afnan, I am absolutely fine,
you don’t worry.
[1674.72] You get unwell in this condition,
[1677.52] the BP gets low.
[1678.92] It is nothing normal and
this shouldn’t happen.
[1684.24] You have to care for yourself
a lot in this condition…
[1688.60] hey, when did you come?
[1690.52] Why are you standing there?
Come inside.
[1693.76] I just came from the office.
[1698.72] I didn’t know when you came.
[1703.28] How would you know?
[1704.88] All your attention is
towards Ramsha.
[1738.56] Greetings.
[1740.60] Yes, aunt.
[1744.40] Hello.
[1745.56] I cannot hear you.
[1747.12] I will go out and talk to you.
[1749.44] Hello.
[1751.92] Yes.
[1755.56] I feel you started serving Ramsha 
as soon as you came from the office.
[1758.72] You didn’t even change your clothes.
[1760.08] Yes, I didn’t change.
[1761.96] I didn’t get the chance.
[1763.68] I found out Ramsha is unwell,
[1765.88] so I came here to ask how she is.
[1767.92] You are really worried for Ramsha.
[1771.96] What do you mean? 
What do you want to say?
[1775.32] That you never cared
 so much for me, Afnan.
[1778.80] You are not in this condition either.
[1781.72] And even if I came and asked her 
how she was in this condition,
[1785.40] then no hell broke loose.
[1788.36] I think you too should
[1791.36] care for her health along with me.
[1794.56] Right now she needs care.
[1825.96] What happened now?
[1829.08] I feel Ramsha is the real niece of uncle,
[1832.04] not me.
[1833.04] He wants to form a relation with him.
[1835.96] Alizay, I am noticing
[1839.88] since Ramsha came to this home,
[1842.36] you are really disturbed cause of her.
[1847.88] Mama, have you not seen how 
Afnan goes around Ramsha.
[1859.52] My husband’s ex-lover
 is sitting in this home
[1862.60] and I shouldn’t even 
be mentally disturbed?
[1873.96] Alizay, you forget those things.
[1876.80] Why don’t you understand that
[1879.16] Ramsha was his past.
[1885.08] You are Afnan’s present and future.
[1887.88] Look my love if
[1889.20] you remain stuck in these things,
[1890.52] how will you move on?
[1893.36] Mama, Afnan still has 
Ramsha in her heart today.
[1901.24] Did you forget what 
Fahad told us
[1904.16] how Ramsha was after Afnan.
[1911.80] Ramsha is not as we 
see her today.
[1915.32] Trapping rich boys by using media
 and social media
[1918.96] and then trapping them in her love
 and using them for her benefit.
[1926.64] This is something these
 girls can do easily.
[1929.48] Ramsha can go to any extent.
[1937.28] Alizay, stop this nonsense.
[1939.52] I know Afnan well, 
he is not like that at all.
[1943.56] If you keep on thinking 
these things, then
[1945.84] your life will become poison.
[1948.64] My life has become poison, mama.
[1956.40] I did love Afnan,
[1958.68] but I didn’t commit a sin.
[1964.28] This  is one truth
[1966.36] and the second truth is that
[1969.00] I have no place for
 Afnan in my heart.
[1980.64] Did you hear it?
[1982.08] And I think you should
 believe it too.
[1986.56] If you want to believe her,
 then do it.
[1989.64] I don’t believe anything she says.
[2000.20] Ramsha.
[2004.64] What happened? 
Why are you crying?
[2007.56] Ramsha, tell me, 
what happened?
[2009.04] Did someone say
 something to you?
[2012.68] Ramsha.
[2034.64] What happened, child?
[2036.72] Nothing uncle,
[2037.92] I just want to go home.
[2039.28] These tears in your eyes. 
Why are you crying?
[2041.48] Look Ramsha, child, I will not 
let you go like this at all.
[2046.20] Nothing happened uncle.
[2048.20] I just want to go home.
[2050.48] Then is this not your home?
[2061.60] The homes are made with parents.
[2068.32] I don’t have parents now.
[2077.44] That is why I have no 
home in this world.
[2084.16] No matter how much 
you call me your daughter,
[2088.44] but saying it doesn’t make 
me your real daughter.
[2101.48] This world doesn’t know
 the place you hold in my heart.
[2109.76] I wish I could open 
my heart and show to everyone
[2113.20] the place you hold 
in my heart, uncle.
[2118.80] I feel something is left
 lacking in my care,
[2121.32] that is why you care more
 for people, and not me.
[2124.28] The lacking is not in your care, 
it is in my character.
[2138.40] The thorns I have sowed 
in the past are still pinching me today.
[2152.28] I don’t know how long 
they will continue to pinch me.
[2157.56] I wish I had controlled 
my untamed wishes,
[2172.32] then character would 
have been stainless like my heart.
[2180.12] Child, what had to happen
 has happened. You tell me,
[2182.20] what has happened? 
Did someone say something?
[2184.76] Did Afsheen say 
something to you?
[2186.96] Tell me. Did someone say something…
[2191.52] did Alizay say something to you?
[2194.20] Huh?
