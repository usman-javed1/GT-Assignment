What can we do now Alizeh? What had to happen, 
has already happened, we are all helpless in front of fate. Whenever there is some 
success in my life, Ramsha comes and 
stands next to me, how? How does all this happen? I don’t get it, Mom. I feel this Ramsha is definitely 
doing some black magic, else how is it possible this girl knows 
everything? Mom, I don’t feel good, I don’t understand 
what is happening. Okay, don’t worry you 
else will get unwell. Let me get unwell! I was so happy mom. I wanted to give Afnan 
the happiness of a child, but now he will also have 
a child from Ramsha, this girl has ruined my entire 
happiness. What are you saying, Alizeh? You will be the one who gives 
the first child to Afnan. And you will give the happiness 
of becoming a father to Afnan, why won’t he value you? Umm, the rest, whatever is written 
in fate will happen any how. I am telling you there is definitely
 something wrong, she is definitely doing 
some black magic that is why whatever she wants,
happens. God knows what is the truth, but I have seen that she is very 
punctual in offering prayers, she doesn’t let any prayer 
go unoffered, I guess that is why God answers 
all her prayers. Mom, I am telling you I am constantly having this doubt 
that she is definitely doing something that is why there is always some 
problem between I and Afnan. My friend Nida, the same thing was happening to her, someone had done black magic on her that is why she and her husband 
always used to fight. Do one thing, get this house cleaned properly, I am sure we will find some amulet. Yes, in fact, let me do one thing, I will get the house cleaned myself 
along with the maid tomorrow. We will definitely find something. And I know it very well why you go 
running at your aunt’s house all the time. Afnan, what are you saying? What do you think that I come here 
because of Shani? That is why you have left me here, 
Afnan? I am surprised how can you think like this 
about me, Afnan? Look I don’t know what are the conflicts
between you and Ramsha but she is so worried, she loves you a lot, I have seen her crying 
for you myself. Aren’t you happy? Afnan, I thought that you might 
stop being upset with me after hearing such a huge good news and your heart will melt for me, but I don’t see your happiness. I loved you so much and you. I guess it was the trial of our love, whether you agree or not, the news of your pregnancy has 
brought me a different kind of happiness that I guess I cannot explain 
in words. Now we have to forget all this 
and start a new life. Madam Ramsha? Madam Ramsha? Yes? Madam Ramsha, 
Sir Afnan has given this dress and has asked you to wear it 
and get ready, there is some party that 
you guys need to attend. He just called, he will be here 
in a while. Did he ask me or Alizeh? Do one thing, call Afnan 
and confirm, you might have had some 
misunderstanding. No, he has taken your name 
and given the orders. Okay, I will see. How do I look? You look very nice. Does this color suit me? Yes, it suits you a lot. Actually Afnan, we are going out 
together after so long so I thought of wearing something 
you would like. That is what you have always done, you have always cared about 
what I like and dislike. You are a very good wife. I want Alizeh to be happy till 
the birth of our child. Ramsha, don’t be sad, is it that you have no trust 
in my love? Ramsha, I love you a lot. Trust me when I say this. Why have you kept these 
Wedding pictures with you? Because it is our pictures… So? What do you want? Do you want to use them 
against me as well? You have kept them 
so you can blackmail me, like you got our shopping video viral, you will do the same with Wedding 
pictures too, right? Why would I do that? Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife. You got our video viral so people 
can get to know about us, and now you will get these Wedding 
pictures viral so everyone can know 
we are married, but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once, what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha? only now I have understood you well,
 Ramsha. Only now I have understood 
who you are. I married you, made you 
the honor of my house. I fulfilled the promise I made 
to my dad who was dying and what did you do? You defamed me in the whole society, nothing else. Tell me where did my love fall short that you cheated on me? Afnan, I didn’t cheat you, If I hadn’t promised my dad, I would have taken you and thrown you 
out of my life right here, right now. Afnan, careful, I might hit my foot
somewhere and fall. I won’t let you fall, now slowly, slowly open your eyes. Shall I open them? What is all this Afnan? Afnan? Afnan, where did you go? Afnan? Afnan, where did you go Afnan? Afnan? Afnan? Afnan? Afnan? I am sorry. I... I am very guilty. What happened? didn’t you like all this? Enough Afnan, I am tired, enough now. It was very difficult for me 
to control myself, if I shatter again this time, it will be very difficult to 
gather myself back. I am unable to understand 
this changed behavior of yours. You switch to being so bitter all of 
a sudden from being so soft, I, I don’t get it. My heart is not strong enough to bear your constantly 
changing behavior, I won’t be able to bear it anymore, I have become weak from within, have mercy on me. I understand what you are saying, I have made a mistake that I didn’t believe you but to be honest, I am very embarrassed. I should have believed you, I should have trusted your character, 
yourself, and everything. But just give me one last chance, try to trust me this time, I won’t break your trust. Why should I trust you? Did you trust me? I am telling you I am embarrassed, 
would you take revenge from me, now? Yes, I will take revenge. Why are you smiling now? When I look at your face, I get a smile on my face. You are lying. No, I am being absolutely honest. I am saying I am sorry. What should I do I feel like winning your heart 
once again today, just give me one chance, please. Alizeh, you getting worried wouldn’t help,
my love. Mom, how should I not worry? Ramsha will give a son to Afnan 
and I will get a daughter, that way, Ramsha’s value will increase
in front of Afnan. Ramsha will be called the mom of a son. What are these superstitious things 
you are talking to me? Okay, tell me one thing, has Afnan ever said something 
like this to you, that I want a son or a daughter? No, he has never said anything like that. End of story then, if Ramsha’s aunt even said 
something like that, it wouldn’t make any difference. Whatever God wants, will happen. Alizeh you should pray that 
God bless you with a healthy baby, that’s it. There is no need to worry, 
just relax. I wanted to give Afnan 
the happiness of a child, but now he will also have a child 
from Ramsha, this girl has ruined my 
entire happiness. What are you saying, Alizeh? You will be the one who gives 
the first child to Afnan. I am telling you there is definitely 
something wrong, she is definitely doing 
some black magic that is why whatever she wants, 
happens. God knows what is the truth, but I have seen that she is very
punctual in offering prayers, she doesn’t let any prayer 
go unoffered, I guess that is why God answers 
all her prayers.
