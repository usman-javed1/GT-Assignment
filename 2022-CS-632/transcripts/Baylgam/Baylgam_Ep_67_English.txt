Why don’t you quit this job? You are always tired cause of it. Afnan, please, right now I don’t even
have the energy that I can argue with you. Okay fine, fine, don’t argue, but you can at least take a few days
before the engagement, right? But why? Who takes an off for
the engagement, Afnan? What are you saying? I am really tired today, we will go tomorrow. When do you have time for me? Afnan, me and all my time is just for you. Believe me. Really? Are you speaking the truth? Afsheen, I was saying that we should get Afnan and
Alizay married now. It is a good deed,
we shouldn’t delay it. Absolutely right brother, Alizay is your daughter. And after all, she doesn’t have to go to
another home after marriage. Uncle. I am sorry uncle, I am not ready to get
married right now. I want some time, right now, I am focusing
on my career. This girl really doesn’t
care about me. She only cares for her
career and her future. Even if I die, it will not
make a difference to her. Ramsha, get ready quickly, we are getting late and listen, you give me that
white jewelry set. That set is kept in my room, you take it from the
dressing table. Okay listen, I cannot go with you, you go yourself, please. Why? Come on, it will be fun and we are going
somewhere after so long. You know Shani. He will create a mountain out
of a mole hill for no reason, it is better that I don’t go. You go yourself, Annie, please. Nothing will happen, after all, we have taken
permission from mama, she will take care of it. My friend has invited
you with so much love. Try and understand what I say. I don’t want to
understand anything, just come on. Quickly get ready. You are really stubborn. Mama. Hey, why are you making
so much noise? What has happened? Where is Ramsha? She went to her friend’s place with Annie,
for her friend’s birthday With whose permission? With my permission. She is my wife, I will make all her decisions. Annie. Annie, went to the poolside
to take a picture. Oh no, excuse me. – Hello. Yes, Shani, I had called you. Your number was off. So what was the need
for you to go? Come back right now. Right now? How can I come back right now,
immediately? I want my documents, and I need them right now. Okay fine,
I will come, Shani. I am leaving from
here immediately. I don’t know
where Annie went. Listen. What are you doing here? I am waiting for an auto. Come on, sit in the car,
I will drop you. There is no need for that. I will go myself. I didn’t ask you to argue, go sit in the car. What are you looking at? I am absolutely right. I have not seen such
a cheap man in my life. Don’t say that, Afnan. Whatever he is, however he is, Shani is my husband. Is this how a husband is like? A husband is a woman’s support, but the husbands who use their wife as
a crutch are shameless. He wants to go to Dubai, that’s why he needed money, or else he is not like that. He is like that, he only holds his benefit dear. Every person has good
and bad qualities, Afnan. I hope that he
will change soon. People like him never
change, Ramsha. He will never change,
believe me. How can you say
this about him? Because I know him,
I have understood him. Whatever he is doing
is for himself. And he is only in touch with me because he knows he can take money from
me through you. I have understood his game. So why did you give him money? I had even told you earlier,
not to give him money. So what do I do? Should I leave you
to suffer sorrow? Try and understand what
I am saying, Ramsha. If I give you the money right now,
and he takes you to his home, later on, if he doesn’t agree to
anything you say, then? What will you do then? I will tolerate it. You stop worrying about me. Why do I not worry,
Ramsha? Why would you
tolerate everything? Why don’t you leave him? What do you want to say? You take a divorce from
Shani and marry me. How did you even
think about this? You consider me to be such
a lowlife, Afnan? I didn’t mean that. You should have let me have
a little respect in your eyes, Afnan. I am not as cheap as
you have thought of me. Leave it. I will go in an auto. You are ruining your life like this. You just once, just once say that you don’t
want to get married, I will support you,
I will stand with you. What is wrong with you, Afnan? What are you saying? Why are you torturing me
and giving me pain? These things you are saying
is torturing me, Afnan. For God’s sake,
be quiet and take me to the hall. I am already really late, if we get late further again, then I will get humiliated because
of you once again. I will not let anything
like this happen. I promise you, you speak the truth once, have courage and tell me, I will stand by you. Shani wont be able to
say anything to you. What is wrong with you? Why are you saying these things? Why are you giving me pain? Why are you torturing
me with what you say? Because I want to marry you. I did love Afnan, but I didn’t commit a sin. This is the one truth and the second truth is that I don’t have any place
for Afnan in my heart. I am not a hypocrite like that I lie to people and deceive them. How have I deceived you? We were friends for so long, you talked to me for so long, and you didn’t even tell me once
that you are engaged. If this is not cheating them
what is it, Afnan? It was not my not my
responsibility to... ... tell you everything
about my personal life. Befriending me was not
your responsibility either. It was not even your responsibility
to talk to me. Then? Still you did all this? I am not answerable to
you for everything. Because you are a liar, that is why you are saying this. When a person is not
clear themselves, that’s when they say this. Accept it, that you are a cheater. Yes, when a person loves, then they also have a desire
to achieve it too. And I feel no shame in saying this, that I love you even today. Just like putting my love
in your heart is something, that is not in your control, just like that it is not in my control to take
out your love from my heart. I love you even today. You think you will get off
the car at this time... ... of the night dressed as a bride ... ...and you think I will leave you ... ...in the middle of the road and go? I think you have forgotten, you had left me midway like this. If I am marrying Shani today, then why are you worried? If I stand on the road like this, then why do you worry? Why? You take a divorce from
Shani and marry me. How did you even
think about this? You consider me to be
such a lowlife, Afnan? What are you doing, Ramsha? Ramsha. Yes, what happened? The milk would have fallen. Where are you lost? I have turned off the stove. What happened? What is the matter, Ramsha? Nothing. Did something happen? Did brother say something? No, nothing happened. That is not possible. Surely something happened because of which you are so disturbed. Nothing happened Annie, it is all fine. Why do you worry? Look here. Tell me. Nothing happened. Ramsha, something has happened. There is surely something that is eating you inside. Tell me, what happened? Hey, you are talking about a little longer. I have even paid all the money, then why am I not getting the visa? You had told me earlier, it would come in a week, now you are saying fifteen days. You are talking about fifteen days. Yes, yes, my preparation is complete, you don’t worry about it. Yes. Yes, send it. Yes. Take me along with you to Dubai. Look Shani, take me with you. I want to live with you. The two of us will go there
and start a new life, and only you and
I will be in that new life. No third person would be there. We will leave all the bitterness
and regrets here, and start a new life. I want to live with you. I want to live my life
with you, Shani. Ramsha, have you gone mad that I will take you to Dubai? I cannot tolerate you here, I don’t want to see your face. I want to go to Dubai
because of this, and you want me to
take you along? We have been married
for so long, Shani. Did you not love me even
once in this time? You are not worth loving. Yes, I am right. No one would
want to accept you. Thank God, that I married you or else no one would have
given you any importance. I wish you were not my husband. You are not worth loving. Yes, I am right. No one would want to accept you. Thank God, that I married you or else no one would have given
you any importance. Whatever he is, however he is, Shani is my husband. Is this how a husband is like? A husband is a woman’s support, but the husbands who use their
wife as a crutch are shameless. He is like that, he only
holds his benefit dear. I hope that he will change soon. People like him never change, Ramsha. He will never change, believe me. How can you say this about him? Because I know him, I have understood him. Whatever he is doing is for himself. And he is only in touch with me because he knows he can take money from me through you. I have understood his game. Where is Shani? He went out with his friend from Dubai. Make your son understand, talk some sense in him. He is crazy about going to Dubai. What does he lack here? He will be ruined. You will see. He will go to Dubai! Hello. Hello. Aunt, I cannot hear her, I will go tell my friend… Child, tell your friend
to call you later, have breakfast. yes, I will go tell her this. Hello. Hello. Hello. Why are you calling
me again and again and bothering me, Afnan? Ramsha, I am really embarrassed. I am really sorry. Believe me, whatever I did,
I didn’t do it on purpose. I didn’t mean to hurt you . Look Afnan, you have done what you had to. Don’t call me again and again
and bother me, please. I don’t want to bother you,
Ramsha, I just want to apologize to you. Fine, I have forgiven you. But don’t call me after this. If you call me after this,
Afnan, then I will switch off my phone. Mama, aunt Ruqaiyah called, she is asking when we will reach. She wants to go on time. Child, I have a lot of pain in my feet, that is why I am sitting
in the sun to compress it. Your father said he will not go. You do one thing, take
Annie and Ramsha and go. No, then no one is going. Son, it will not look nice. It is the first wedding in
sister Ruqaiyah’s home. She has been with us in our
happiness and sorrow. She will not like that no one from
our home went to the wedding. Whatever work you
have do it later, go right now. Mama, you are so unwell. Do one thing, send brother
and Ramsha together. If you get unwell while
we are gone, then? I am not leaving you and going. Mama, neither is Annie going, nor are you going, so I am not taking Ramsha. You make an excuse to her, tell them, we are not coming. Hey, you are always ready to go
to parties of your friends. Now when we are talking about
going in a family gathering, you are making
a hundred excuses. Go, call Ramsha. Mama, I am not taking
Ramsha along, I will go alone. Hey, she is your wife, take her along with you. If you go meet family
without your wife, then people will say
a hundred things. Child, go and call Ramsha. Ramsha.
