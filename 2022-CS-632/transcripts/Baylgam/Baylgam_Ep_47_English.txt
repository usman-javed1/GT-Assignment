I don’t understand that by what relation can Mr Qasim 
keep Ramsha in his house? What is she to her? 
What is their relationship? Ramsha was telling that 
he has made her his daughter. Enough, enough, enough, you let it be, no one becomes a daughter just 
by saying it, the situation is not like that nowadays, we don’t know about a person’s 
intentions. The environment of Mr. Qasim’s house
 and his intentions are way better than this house. What? What are you trying to say? What do you mean? Yeah? I don’t mean anything, I am just trying to say that 
the world knows Mr. Qasim, he is a religious man and Ramsha was praising him 
a lot as well and you used to praise him 
yourself too. Do you remember how he helped Brother Sajid at the time 
of Ramsha’s wedding? How can anyone doubt on such
a kind-hearted person? What is so difficult in fooling the world? What do we know what is 
in a person’s heart? They are something else on the face
 and something else behind the back. I will talk to Mr. Qasim myself now and I will ask him what is his 
relationship with Ramsha. Whose call is it? He has a long life, it is Mr. Qasim. Greetings Mr. Qasim. Yes, yes, thank God. Okay. Umm, okay okay I will let you know. Yes, yes, right, right. Bye. What was he saying? He has asked me and you to come to his home. Come, son, let’s go. Go where? Where is Ramsha? She won’t come with us. What do you mean she won’t 
come with us? The way your dad has treated her, she is not ready to go to that house at all now. And by the way sister-in-law was 
with her earlier but now she is all alone and
 it is better for her. And anyways she is happy and 
satisfied in this house and she is safe too. Mom and dad has sat back quietly, it doesn't make any difference to me 
whether Ramsha comes home or not but now people will get another chance 
to make fun of us when people will find out that 
Ramsha was living with strangers, they will call us shameless. Mom, herself is home all day
and dad is at the shop, I have to face people but I won’t let people make 
fun of me now, my name is Shani and 
I don’t give up very easily, what needs to be done this time,
 it will only be my decision, just my decision. Ramsha? Ramsha? what is this way of coming 
to someone’s home? And why are you shouting? Call Ramsha, she will go with me. Behave, this is my home, 
not yours. Ramsha? Ramsha? Ramsha? You? Why have you come here? Come with me, right now, 
come, let’s go home. I’ll not go with you anywhere. I have already informed aunt, 
so you may leave. Ramsha, don’t act stubborn, 
you will come with me right now. I told you to stop arguing, I don’t want to go anywhere 
with you, leave. I will see how you wouldn’t go
 from here. Shani, what are you doing? 
Leave my hand, it is hurting. I am telling you I won’t come 
with you so I won’t. You will come with me. Shani, leave my hand. 
What is all this going on? I am here to take her; 
she will come with me. First leave her hand, leave her 
hand and talk to me. I used to consider you a noble son 
of a noble father but the way you are acting like 
a goon inside my home, it shows your character and 
how your father has raised you as well. I am here to take her; 
she will come with me. Look I didn’t call you; I called your parents; 
Ramsha won’t go with you. she is my fiancé and she will go with me, 
no one can stop her, not even you. No, no, uncle he is lying, we never 
had any engagement. We were said to be married but 
mom called it off while she was alive, he is lying, go away from here. Did you hear that? You have to come with me, 
right now, do you understand? I am not shameless like you that I should leave you on others 
and go away from here. Will you come with me or 
should I drag you from here? Son? I guess you don’t understand that I told you Ramsha won’t come with you. And Mr. Qasim, even I told you that she will come with me right now. What do you want? Would you leave 
on your own or should I call the guards? What you are doing is wrong but remember one thing, I will file a case against you for kidnapping her and murdering aunt. for now, leave, and do whatever you feel like, hmm? Don’t take me easy. 
Out. Brother, what is this behavior, after all, how many scenes will be created 
in this house because of this girl? I will suggest you go and 
tell the guards that if anyone comes to meet this girl, just throw them out of this house. There is a limit! You give me your address; I will drop you there. Where do you live? 
Where do you reside? Umm, actually, umm, I don’t have anyone in this world 
except my mother. I mean any relative or acquaintance, 
uncle or aunt, etc? Anyone? No one. That is why I don’t want to go there, whatever has happened is in front of you, I wanted to tell you all this earlier, uncle, but I didn’t have the courage to, I and mom were helpless so we didn't have 
any other option except leaving that place. Everything is in front of you uncle, I don’t want to go back to that house. Just imagine Uncle, where I wasn’t safe in the presence 
of Mom, how unsafe I would be there 
without Mom and Dad. I am scared, I don’t want to go there. The ones who have been unjust to you 
should be scared. I think about how many rewards have God kept 
for a good attitude towards other people, and we are such fools, instead of trading with God, we ruin our life and hereafter just 
because of money. Anyway, don’t worry, I am with you my child, and 
you don’t have to worry at all and no one will take you 
out of this house. Look, had you told me this earlier, you wouldn’t have to go through 
this problem. I wanted to tell you but uncle, I didn’t have the courage. I felt that if I tell you everything and 
you don’t believe me, what will happen to me? Anyway, you don’t have 
to be scared now and don’t worry, okay? May God make the right decision. Uncle? Yes, my child? There is a burden on my heart and
I want to get rid of it. What burden? I promised you, right, that 
I won’t hide anything from you? Yes, yes, I know. There is a lot that you don’t know. You carry on tell me what 
you are trying to say. What is Ramsha talking to brother
 about so late at night? Shani? Who asked you to go to 
Mr. Qasim’s house? What was the need to go there 
and talk rubbish? So, I didn’t do anything wrong, 
what I did was right. I will give you a tight slap, only then you will understand 
what is right and what is wrong. Have you seen Mr. Qasim’s status? What is your position in front of him? Listen to me very carefully if I ever see you going to 
Mr. Qasim’s house again, I will break your legs. Do you even know that because of you I tolerated 
so much humiliation today? I have heard so much from him. So, who asked you to listen to him? He must be a lord at his own home, we don’t need to bend down 
in front of him. Make your son understand, tell him the ones who don’t bend, they break. What is the position of your son? He doesn’t know the ABCs of the world and he is ready to be a big shot. Okay, now don’t get angry, I will tell him. Tell your son else I will make him understand 
my own way. The things that can be solved 
by talking nicely, he ruined the whole game with his anger. Make your son understand, if I tell him my way, 
he won’t be able to bear it. Okay, please go away from here, if you keep on seeing him in front of you,
 you will get angry. I am here to take her; 
she will come with me. Look I didn’t call you; I called your parents; 
Ramsha won’t go with you. she is my fiancé and she will go with me, 
no one can stop her, not even you. Will you come with me or 
should I drag you from here? Son? I guess you don’t understand that I told you Ramsha won’t 
come with you. And Mr Qasim, even I told you that she will come with me right now. What do you want? Would you leave on your own 
or should I call the guards? What you are doing is wrong but remember one thing, I will file a case against you for kidnapping her and murdering aunt. I am scared, I don’t want to go there. The ones who have been unjust to you
should be scared. I think about how many rewards have God kept 
for a good attitude towards other people, and we are such fools, instead of trading with God, we ruin our life and hereafter just 
because of money. I told you. How dare you? What happened Afnan? When I asked you stay away from 
that girl then how dare you? You did such a disgusting thing with her
that I can’t believe it. What are you doing? Leave me,
people are watching. everyone’s watching? Everyone should know that this person, this person is a harasser, he has taken advantage of a helpless
 and a girl without a family, he harassed her. I am ashamed to call you 
my friend today, a disgusting man like you shouldn’t be
 part of this society. Is she your lover that you are humiliating
 your friend because of her? You are disgusting who is having fun with an outsider 
despite having a wife at home. Not every person is characterless 
like you are, neither I have anything 
in my heart like that nor she is characterless. And I will kill you if I ever see you 
even near Ramsha next time, do you understand? Hello? Are you alive? Just think that I am alive for you Right, so many days pass by and you don’t
even bother showing me your face and now you are talking 
this big stuff. You know I am very stubborn; I won’t die that easily at least I won’t die till 
I tell you a secret. What secret? A secret which is very important 
for me to tell you. So, tell me, where would you meet me? I am in a shopping mall right now, I need to get done with some shopping,
you come home in a while, I will go home then. 
No, no, not at home, secrets cannot be told at home. What are you saying? 
I don’t understand anything. Okay do one thing, 
come here to the mall, we will meet here only, meanwhile, 
I will get done with some more shopping. You just wait for me for 15 minutes; I will be there. Okay fine, bye. Sorry Afnan, I am really sorry. Mom, now when you go
 to meet Ramsha, please take me along, I have heard that Mr. Qasim’s bungalow
is very huge and very beautiful, I want to see it too. I will never go there at all. Whatever you brother has done there 
and brought shame to us, I will never go there, what will they think what sort of 
people we are. Don’t take any tension about it at all. Rich people don’t have time to think 
about what poor people are thinking. By the way mom, you should have brought 
Ramsha’s number at least, I would have at least got to talk to her. Why are you looking at me like that? I haven’t even seen her face for so long, 
I would at least get to talk. By the way, she had a wish to live
in such a big house, she must be happy, right? I don’t know if she is happy or not but she is very satisfied there. And I have seen a lot of changes in her, do you know? She has become very patient, she covers her head and is punctual in offering prayers too, I guess she has joined some 
Islamic Academy. What? Islamic Academy? Mom, did you see Ramsha only? Or did you see someone else and 
felt you saw Ramsha? There is nothing like that, would I not recognize Ramsha? What are you even saying? Human beings change with time, she changed as well. That is not possible mom, Ramsha is the one who changes time, not herself. Now I definitely want to meet Ramsha. Do one thing, let’s go to Mr. Qasim’s house 
tomorrow only. I want to say how true are you. Okay, if you don’t believe your mom then what can I say? Do you mean Ramsha cannot change? Okay tell me what was the secret you want to tell? I am telling, I am telling. First, you answer a question, who do you trust the most in this world? What sort of a question is this? And what is the connection of this 
to what you are saying? There is a connection, tell me? Who do you trust the most 
in the whole world. Off course on my own self. yes, but after yourself? Umm, after myself, on Afnan. What happened? 
Why are you laughing? He is my husband, off course, if I won’t trust him 
who else will I trust? A person should trust their life partner. Yes, but I would never marry a girl who already has an affair and would be continuing 
after marriage too. What are you trying to say? Please don’t riddle with me. I just have one answer 
to all these riddles. Ramsha.
