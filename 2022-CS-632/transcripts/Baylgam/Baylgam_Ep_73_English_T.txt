[22.16] You should talk to Shani.
[30.08] How can he blame Ramsha?
[37.44] He is sitting in anger upstairs.
[39.12] Go, talk to him. 
What is this behavior?
[43.56] When it comes to them, 
my mind has stopped working.
[54.88] They do not have anything else 
to do than just fight.
[61.40] They fight 24/7.
[64.68] We also used to fight,
[67.48] but no, it is nothing in front of them.
[72.28] Where is the princess? 
Has she not come back yet?
[75.76] How would I know? 
I have tried calling multiple times,
[78.32] but she is not answering. No one 
is answering at Mr. Qasim’s home.
[81.28] I don’t know what is happening.
[83.04] Please go, and talk to Shani once.
[85.60] Please go.
[88.48] Look,
[90.76] don’t panic.
[92.08] Nothing is going to happen to you.
[93.60] I will handle everything.
[96.08] I really wish you had told me
 all this earlier,
[99.16] then things wouldn’t have 
escalated to this level.
[102.36] Afnan, I tried to make him understand
 a lot of times.
[105.40] I tried to make him understand politely, 
I even gave him money.
[109.84] But I don’t know how it happened 
Afnan I didn’t want to kill him.
[116.20] I killed him. 
I am a murderer now, Afnan.
[119.68] What will now happen to me? 
Police will come and arrest me now.
[122.04] No, nothing is going to happen 
to you.
[123.36] It is possible that he did not die.
[124.88] How can you be so sure 
that he is dead?
[128.04] It is possible that when you hit him, 
he only fell unconscious. That’s it.
[131.24] Police will take me. 
I am a murderer.
[135.20] Nothing will happen. 
Nothing will happen. Trust me.
[138.64] I have a friend. He is the head 
of the crime branch.
[141.12] I will talk to him. 
He will handle everything.
[143.20] No, Afnan. You cannot tell anyone.
[145.92] If you tell anyone, everyone will say 
that I killed him.
[149.56] And Shani will know. 
Shani will kill me. And they…
[153.00] Ramsha, come to your senses.
[156.08] Control yourself.
[158.68] Nothing will happen to you.
[160.88] I will not let anything happen 
to you Ramsha.
[165.84] Believe me.
[168.00] Just do not tell anyone about this.
[170.92] Do you understand? Please.
[174.64] Just relax and sit down. Sit.
[228.80] Look he is here.
[231.48] What kind of a ruckus 
you couple have made?
[234.36] Do you two have nothing better 
to do than blame each other?
[355.68] Now will you two still call me a liar?
[375.20] This video has been recorded 
and sent to me by her lover.
[377.76] His name is Danish Kamal.
[393.72] Do you need any more proof 
of her shamelessness?
[460.44] Yes, yes, yes. Mr. SP.
[463.00] I will return this favor. 
Thank you so much.
[464.92] Thank you. Thanks a lot.
[468.64] I have talked to Mr. SP.
[476.12] He has arranged for Danish Kamal 
to be sent to the hospital.
[479.28] He only had minor injuries. 
He is fine.
[488.12] His laptop and phone are with 
the crime branch.
[495.88] And Mr. SP has assured me that 
your name will not be mentioned,
[499.88] so just relax.
[503.32] Afnan I do not know how 
all of this happened.
[506.40] I didn’t want to do any of this,
[508.28] but I was helpless and powerless.
[510.00] My name will not be mentioned, right?
[511.56] Ramsha, your name will 
not be mentioned.
[513.44] You trust what I am saying.
[516.52] Yes, but what if the police 
come to my house?
[519.28] If they arrest me, 
what will I explain to everyone?
[522.16] How will I show my face to everyone? 
This will never going to heppen
[524.80] I am with you.
[526.84] I will not let anything happen to you.
[533.56] But if your face remains ashen
[536.44] and stress-laden like this then everyone
 will doubt that something is wrong.
[539.20] They might even find out.
[541.28] So please, relax yourself.
[544.56] We got out of a problem 
like this before.
[548.60] We can get out of it again.
[551.44] You have 20 minutes.
[553.48] In 20 minutes, I will drop you 
at your house.
[556.80] Try to get into your normal zone 
by that time.
[574.96] Please act like I explained to you. 
Okay?
[583.04] Please, fix your mood now.
[588.72] Thank you so much Afnan.
[591.40] You are most welcome.
[594.04] Goodbye. 
Bye.
[646.80] Hello.
[669.20] Do not take a single step.
[679.84] Tell me, where you are coming from?
[681.32] From uncle’s house.
[695.56] I told Aunty before leaving. 
Aunty, you didn’t tell Shani?
[702.84] You didn’t tell Mom that you are going
to meet your lover?
[744.60] How shameless can you be?
[747.72] Sometimes your name is attached with
Afnan and then sometimes with Danish Kamal.
[786.20] But tell me this, how many more 
do you have hidden?
[790.24] No, Shani, I...
[792.08] I do not want to hear anything.
[794.60] Danish Kamal sent me your video,
[810.04] and everyone has seen it. 
Everyone knows that you are a…
[815.56] What is this?
[817.96] There is a limit to shamelessness 
Ramsha.
[831.92] What was lacking in our love, 
care, and kindness
[835.24] that you are doing this?
[836.92] You have insulted us in front of 
all our relatives.
[839.52] We cannot look anyone in the eye.
[843.72] Aunty, I…
Why did you come back?
[846.96] Don’t you have any decency?
[863.36] If you didn’t care about our dignity,
[865.60] you should have cared about 
the dignity of your dead parents.
[877.12] Thank God they passed away 
before seeing this day
[889.08] and this bad omen was written for us.
[893.24] I accept that I made a mistake,
[895.60] but it is not what you think.
[898.36] Stop it now.
[899.80] Don’t label your sin as a mistake.
[919.16] We kept you with love and care in 
our house, just like our daughter Annie.
[923.92] With respect.
[936.44] This is what you repaid us with?
[938.60] What have you done?
[943.36] We can not look anyone in the eye 
because of you.
[947.24] Aunty, it is not what it seems…
[949.56] I do not want to hear anything 
from you.
[951.56] What is left to say now?
[962.72] I can not even look myself 
in the eye because of you.
[973.80] Your mom died and 
went six feet under,
[988.76] and you have sent me to the grave
while I am still alive.
[992.24] You are not listening to me…
[994.68] Stop it.
[997.88] I don’t want to hear a 
single word you say.
[999.48] No one will listen to her here.
[1012.40] I will not tolerate you for a 
single second in my life and I…
[1016.28] Shani, I…
[1018.68] I divorce you.
[1033.36] I divorce you.
[1057.44] I divorce you!!
[1277.32] Danish Kamal I am warning you
for the last time.
[1280.44] Then tell me what will you do?
[1284.36] What will you do?
[1286.52] What will you do?
[1319.12] I have talked to Mr. SP.
[1322.44] He has arranged for Danish Kamal 
to be sent to the hospital.
[1327.36] He only had minor injuries. 
He is fine.
[1330.76] His laptop and phone are 
with the crime branch.
[1334.96] And Mr. SP has assured me that
your name will not be mentioned,
[1338.76] so just relax. Okay.
[1341.24] Afnan I do not know 
how all of this happened.
[1343.96] I didn’t want to do any of this,
[1345.88] but I was helpless and powerless.
[1347.64] My name will not be mentioned, right?
[1349.12] Ramsha, your name will 
not be mentioned.
[1351.16] You trust what I am saying.
[1353.76] Yes, but what if the police 
come to my house?
[1356.56] If they arrest me, 
what will I explain to everyone?
[1359.52] How will I show my face to everyone? 
This will never going to heppen
[1362.04] I am with you.
[1364.12] I will not let anything happen to you.
[1426.64] Crying and guilt is of no use Ramsha.
[1430.44] What has happened has happened.
[1434.96] It is because of this reason 
I used to warn you.
[1436.68] To stop you.
[1440.44] The mistakes of your past have 
ruined your present and future.
[1450.48] Do you think that I am a 
promiscuous woman?
[1454.84] Do you really believe that?
[1460.56] I don’t know,
[1467.72] but what I have seen and 
heard today,
[1472.52] Ramsha it seems that
[1475.96] I never really understood you.
[1486.60] You have ended everything.
[1491.84] You have ruined everything,
[1495.48] the beautiful relationship 
between me and you,
[1502.60] the peace of this house,
[1505.20] the trust of my mother,
[1509.00] and our respect.
[1512.24] Everything.
[1515.04] Everyone is blaming me without 
letting me explain myself.
[1520.08] No one heard me.
[1526.96] Someone should have asked me 
once what happened.
[1530.04] What was my helplessness 
that I resorted to this step?
[1532.68] What was this helplessness Ramsha
[1534.92] that took you Danish Kamal’s 
bedroom?
[1565.04] Danish sent me your video,
[1567.68] and everyone has seen it. 
Everyone knows that you are a…
[1575.36] What is this?
[1577.84] There is a limit to shamelessness 
Ramsha.
[1590.00] What was lacking in our love, 
care, and kindness
[1593.24] that you are doing this?
[1594.72] You have insulted us 
in front of all our relatives.
[1597.56] We cannot look anyone 
in the eye.
[1601.36] Aunty, I…
Why did you come back?
[1604.28] Don’t you have any decency?
[1606.44] If you didn’t care about our dignity,
[1608.52] you should have cared about
 the dignity of your dead parents.
[1612.00] Thank God
[1615.08] they passed away before 
seeing this day
[1618.44] and this bad omen was 
written for us.
[1644.96] Your mom died and 
went six feet under,
[1650.08] and you have sent me to the grave 
while I am still alive.
[1653.76] You are not listening to me…
[1656.52] Stop it.
[1659.36] I don’t want to hear a 
single word you say.
[1660.68] No one will listen to her here.
[1667.68] I will not tolerate you for a 
single second in my life and I…
[1672.24] Shani, I…
[1674.24] I divorce you.
[1677.84] I divorce you.
[1680.72] I divorce you!!
[1741.96] Hello.
[1743.24] Yes, Hi. Who is this?
[1750.36] What!
[1755.44] What happened Aunt? 
Is everything okay?
[1757.96] Afnan, Ramsha’s aunt called.
[1762.04] Yeah, what was she saying?
Is everything all right?
[1766.56] Shani has divorced Ramsha.
[1776.40] What?
[1924.04] What happened in a few moments?
[1928.28] Shani has left. 
The whole house is empty.
[1933.88] Till yesterday, wasn’t this house 
filled with happiness?
[1937.32] We didn’t even think that 
it would become so lonely.
[1949.64] Now gloom will take hold 
of this house.
[1955.24] My God.
[1956.72] I do not understand this
[1959.44] that why haven’t you kicked 
this girl out of this house?
[1969.16] Are you listening to me?
[1972.92] Huh.
[1975.20] Throw this girl out of this house.
[1978.64] She doesn’t have any right 
to stay here.
[1987.28] If you will not do it,
I will do it myself.
[1990.20] I am telling you this.
[1993.76] Anwar, how can I throw her out
 of the house?
[2003.40] She is a young girl.
[2004.96] Tomorrow people will call us 
oppressors.
[2014.44] I have called Afsheen.
[2020.44] When she comes, then 
we will know what will happen.
[2024.40] This is all because of you.
[2027.64] This is all your doing.
[2034.48] Your kindness has shown us this day.
[2042.56] I told you before to be strict 
with this girl,
[2045.92] but no, you never listen to me.
[2054.00] Why are you forgetting
[2055.72] that we have a young child as well?
[2057.60] A young girl.
[2059.04] How will these things affect her?
[2061.44] Yes, this is what I am afraid of.
[2065.76] That I am the mother of a young girl.
[2069.00] If I throw Ramsha out of the house,
 people will gossip.
[2074.40] What if God forbid this affects 
her marriage proposals?
[2079.92] I cannot do this.
[2083.24] We are going through 
very delicate times.
[2088.76] We have to be very vigilant.
[2139.44] Annie,
[2142.72] Annie, At least you listen 
to what I have to say.
[2149.04] Annie.
[2157.84] The food is ready if you want to eat.
[2160.36] Aunty, aunty please listen 
to me for once.
[2166.16] You used to say to me that 
if my mom isn’t here don’t worry,
[2172.12] I am your mom.
[2173.92] Today, your daughter needs you.
[2176.40] Your daughter is divorced.
[2181.00] I need a mother’s shoulder to cry on.
[2186.28] Please don’t turn away from me.
[2188.68] Today, this is the only relation left
between me and you.
[2192.88] Please do not end it.
[2196.00] You ended everything yourself.
[2201.64] I accept that I have made 
many mistakes.
[2205.76] I have sinned a lot.
[2208.88] But, what you have seen is not 
the complete truth.
[2213.36] If you just listen to me once, 
I will explain everything.
[2219.48] What I have seen and heard is not
the complete truth?
[2223.40] Then what is the truth?
[2225.32] What is the truth that 
I will hear today,
[2227.00] and my heart will find ease?
[2230.20] We provided refuge to you.
[2232.04] Kept you in our house, 
I always defended you.
[2235.20] I treated you like my own daughter
and this how you repaid me?
[2238.84] Believe me,
[2240.16] had my daughter done something
similar I would have killed her.
[2246.48] Just listen to me once.
[2248.80] Just hear me out completely.
[2252.36] After that, you may kill me.
[2255.64] I accept it.
