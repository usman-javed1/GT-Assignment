[16.32] Just given medicine to sister-in-law
and made her lie down,
[19.48] she must rest for a while.
[20.72] Its good, she will rest for a while,
[23.04] Mehnaz’s BP already gets very high.
[26.32] Yes.
[36.04] That…
[37.24] Papa. Papa. Uncle, where is papa…
[51.48] Shameless girl,
[54.12] because of you…
[56.36] because of my father like brother 
left me and went.
[62.56] Because of you. 
You are a murderer.
[65.12] You are the murderer of your father.
[75.92] I should not see you here. 
Take her from here.
[78.20] Take her.
[79.28] Anwar, one minute. Be quiet.
[81.48] This is not the time to talk 
about these things.
[83.20] I said, I will not see her here. 
Get lost. Take her away.
[86.44] Child, go inside. 
Ramsha, child, go inside.
[89.84] Come on. Come on. 
Come inside.
[93.44] Disobedient child.
[96.60] She is the murderer.
[98.04] Stop it.
[99.04] She is my brother’s murderer. 
I will not forgive this girl all my life.
[105.52] Dad, what was the need for you 
to come here from the airport.
[108.48] You should have at least told me,
[110.16] I would have picked you, 
or sent the driver.
[112.44] Great.
[114.28] I am not as old as you people 
consider me.
[117.32] How hard is it to come home
from the airport?
[122.64] But brother, you always do this,
[125.52] you don’t bother others with 
your existence.
[133.00] Give us a chance to serve you once.
[135.44] Afnan is absolutely right.
[138.40] Okay, I will be careful in future 
on your insistence. Okay?
[142.44] Should I serve food for you?
[145.12] I am not hungry.
[147.12] You have come after so many days, 
we will eat together.
[149.24] I will get it served.
[150.40] Greeting.
[152.24] How are you Mr. Anwar?
[158.20] When?
[171.72] May God give you all patience,
[174.68] this is the reality.
[179.40] Mr. Anwar, when is the funeral?
[192.40] Fine, I will surely come.
[194.88] Do let me know if I can be of any help.
[197.24] I will come.
[199.96] What happened dad? 
Who passed away?
[202.24] Hey, that Mr. Sajid from the store,
[205.60] for whose daughter’s wedding 
I gave you money.
[208.00] Yes.
[208.76] He had a heart attack, 
he passed away.
[212.60] We have to go to the funeral, 
we will go. Okay?
[215.64] Dad, you just came. 
You must be tired.
[218.28] Hey no man, what is wrong?
[220.08] All of us have to go one day.
[221.92] This funeral is a reminder.
[233.64] May God forgive him.
[237.08] He was a good, decent man.
[253.88] Ramsha.
[255.84] Yes, papa, I am coming.
[259.52] Here you go, your light.
[261.08] You brought it. You are so good. 
Thank you.
[264.04] Hey, my daughter makes a wish 
and I don’t fulfill it? How is it possible?
[267.32] Thank you papa.
[268.56] What was the need to bring this?
You fulfill all her wishes.
[272.36] This unconditional love of 
yours has spoiled her.
[276.16] I have one daughter, wife of mine,
[278.52] if I don’t care for her wishes, 
then will we care about the neighbours?
[283.44] Mehnaz,
[285.04] this is the same Ramsha right?
[287.56] She grew up so quickly.
[290.72] I remember the day when 
the nurse gave a doll in my arms,
[295.08] that sir, you had a daughter.
[297.48] I thanked God,
[299.68] that thank you God, 
you sent blessings to our home.
[309.56] Papa, you are really good.
[311.64] Thank you so much.
[313.40] Thank you, papa. 
Thank you.
[316.48] I am not from amongst 
those father’s child,
[319.60] who put their daughters on the line 
to save their relations.
[324.24] One happiness of yours is greater than 
everything in the world for me.
[337.96] Sister in law, why will we keep this girl here?
[340.68] She is not a girl!
[345.48] She is my daughter! My daughter.
[356.44] She agreed that her father gets insulted
 in front of the world.
[360.28] Fine.
[365.04] But I don’t accept that my daughter 
is dragged out of my home.
[376.20] I really don’t find peace.
[377.96] If you don’t forgive me,
[380.88] I will die. Forgive me.
[383.48] Forgive me, papa,
[385.40] I will do anything after this.
[388.52] Forgive me with your heart, please.
[391.04] Please, papa.
[394.48] You are stubborn since childhood.
[399.40] After all, you are my daughter.
[408.72] I forgive you with my heart, child.
[420.44] That’s it, I have had enough.
[426.88] My daughter didn’t commit such a big sin,
[429.36] that you are punishing her like this.
[431.92] If this is what decent people do
[436.04] that they bring their family and insult 
the sisters and daughters of people,
[443.28] then we are really not that decent.
[449.00] Before I drag you out,
[454.28] leave from here.
[456.44] Leave!
[464.00] I don’t have the courage 
to face people, Anwar.
[470.84] My back is broken,
[473.40] I feel as though,
[476.04] there is no strength in my legs.
[480.12] My steps wont support me.
[484.12] My respect is ruined.
[486.92] I wish
[490.08] I too had died along with this respect,
[497.60] it would have been so good.
[514.96] Ramsha.
[519.00] They have brought elder papa.
[532.08] Come on.
[547.00] Brother Anwar, we are really sorry.
[549.28] I couldn’t believe it.
[551.36] I had met brother Sajid a week back.
[555.04] Even we don’t believe it
[558.64] that my brother,
[561.24] the head of our family,
[564.20] would leave us and go suddenly.
[568.08] The heart attack was an excuse.
[569.84] His daughter’s wedding got canceled,
[572.04] how could a respectable father 
tolerate all this.
[574.24] What? The wedding got canceled?
[576.36] But why? Was it a matter of dowry?
[579.48] Hey, nothing like that.
[581.84] Actually, his daughter ran away 
from the home.
[584.64] What do I say about the one 
who passed away?
[586.44] May God forgive him.
[588.24] If the children are disobedient, 
then the parents have to tolerate a lot.
[593.40] Brother Sajid couldn’t tolerate it, 
he was weak.
[642.64] Sister in law.
[644.84] Sister in law.
[647.68] Sister in law.
[650.48] Sister in law, get a grip on yourself, 
open your eyes.
[654.64] Sister in law, look at him 
for the last time.
[659.08] After that you wont be able 
to see him, they will take him.
[664.28] Sister in law.
[672.92] Sister in law.
[699.36] Get a grip on yourself.
[729.20] Ramsha,
[733.12] I had told you not to come here.
[736.64] Leave. Go to your room.
[738.44] Go. Take her away.
[741.56] Let her see elder papa’s face once, papa.
[743.72] Not at all.
[745.52] This will not happen with me alive.
[748.44] A disobedient child doesn’t have a right
[750.60] that they see the face of a dead father. 
Take her inside. Take her!
[753.80] No.
[755.12] No, no, uncle.
[757.08] Don’t torment me like this.
[759.52] Let me see my father’s face.
[763.00] All of you know how much 
papa loved me.
[775.52] When everyone rejected me,
[780.88] my father had hugged me.
[785.56] No one can stop me from seeing 
my father’s face.
[788.16] A sin…
Stop it. People are seeing.
[790.04] She is committing a sin and 
then she is arguing.
[793.32] Stop it. 
She has killed my brother.
[795.60] Don’t get angry. 
She is a sinner.
[797.24] Papa, please.
[798.24] You want to hit me, right?
No.
[799.56] You can hit me. 
Hit me.
[801.64] But I will surely see my father’s face,
[804.48] and no one can take away 
the right for it.
[807.96] It is enough. Go back from here.
[809.84] Papa. Papa, please get up.
[812.76] After today, I will not do anything wrong.
[815.56] See, I am Ramsha, your daughter.
[817.84] I am with you. 
I am calling you.
[820.88] Mama. Mama, make papa get up.
[823.56] You tell him once that 
Ramsha is calling him,
[826.40] he would listen to everything I would say.
[828.56] Tell him to get up. Mama, 
why are you not listening to me?
[832.08] Hear me.
[833.12] Aunt. Aunt. Aunt,
[835.20] please. Please, make my father get up.
[837.40] He loves me a lot. 
How can he leave me and go?
[841.00] Ramsha, child. 
He knows I will be alone.
[843.08] How will I do it all? 
Papa. Papa. See.
[846.52] Papa, look at me. Get up,
[849.04] Ramsha is calling you. 
Why don’t listen to me? Papa!
[855.40] Ramsha.
[857.84] Sister in law.
[859.40] Ramsha. Ramsha. 
Ramsha.
[861.24] Sister in law. 
Get water quickly.
[864.20] Sister in law. Sister in law. Ramsha.
[867.20] Mr. Qasim, my brother,
[870.52] my beloved brother was 
in place of my father.
[874.92] When my father passed away,
[878.96] I didn’t feel that I have become an orphan.
[887.44] Because my brother was with me.
[890.44] But believe me,
[893.44] today, I am sure,
[896.64] that I have become an orphan.
[898.80] Have patience.
[901.08] That’s what God wanted.
[904.12] Every soul has to taste death.
[909.08] Just think that Sajid came 
with these breaths.
[917.80] I am really sorry to hear about your brother.
[923.68] May God forgive him.
[925.84] Amen. Amen.
[928.04] If a person is patient in difficult times,
[932.28] then God especially blesses him for that.
[935.16] I know, I can understand the sorrow 
you feel when someone your own leaves,
[939.44] but believe me, the bigger the test is,
[942.84] God will bless you for it equally.
[945.04] You are right.
[947.76] I am trying my best,
[951.00] but I am unable to find peace.
[953.08] The Prophet (P.B.U.H.) has said 
that God is with the patient ones.
[959.12] You pray for your brother’s forgiveness,
[961.80] May God make this journey easy for Sajid,
[964.48] may He give him a place in heaven.
[968.76] Amen.
[970.08] What time is the funeral prayer?
[974.84] After the asar prayers.
[976.80] May God help us complete 
our responsibility
[982.28] and the sooner this responsibility 
is fulfilled, the better.
[985.48] God will be kind. 
God will make it easy.
[988.48] Make them sit.
[998.28] Send a black coffee for me, please.
Thank you.
[1030.44] Afnan.
[1033.84] Yes, Afnan, go ahead. All okay?
[1036.36] No Alizay,
[1038.56] nothing is fine.
[1040.40] Why? What happened? Are you fine?
[1044.32] What do I tell you?
[1046.68] I am not fine.
[1053.16] I really miss you, Alizay.
[1056.24] Oh God, Afnan, you had scared me.
[1058.72] See,
[1060.36] this means you always worry for me too.
[1063.00] But if I say it like this that I am always 
in your heart and mind, that would be better.
[1067.60] No, there is nothing like that.
[1070.56] That’s how it is.
[1072.72] How do you know?
[1074.04] How can you be so sure?
[1076.96] I have your heart.
[1082.32] I know the importance of it well
[1084.88] and no one knows the condition 
is better than me.
[1089.08] Okay. I feel you have no work today,
[1091.56] you are totally free.
[1092.92] No, I am really busy.
[1095.28] I just missed you so I called.
[1097.24] Hmmm.
[1098.80] Okay, Afnan, put the phone down now, 
I am going to the office, I am getting late.
[1101.44] I will call you when I get there.
[1102.88] Are you sure?
[1104.28] You will call, right? 
You wont forget, right?
[1106.40] Why will I forget? I will call you.
[1108.36] Fine,
[1109.92] I am disconnecting the call 
on the condition
[1112.56] that now you will call me.
[1163.20] Mama.
[1169.00] I have kept your medication, 
please take it.
[1175.56] Leave from here.
[1180.68] Mama,
[1183.48] do you too feel like everyone that 
I am responsible for papa’s death?
[1194.76] Speak up, mama. Answer me.
[1197.00] Look here, and tell me, 
that do you really feel
[1199.60] that I am responsible for papa’s death?
[1202.92] Speak up, why are you not answering?
[1204.80] Yes!
[1205.84] You are responsible for 
my husband’s death.
[1219.92] You have killed my husband.
[1222.60] Because of you my husband’s 
heart stopped.
[1231.44] Because whatever you did was
 enough to stop his heart.
[1241.64] Now go from here. 
Leave from here.
[1248.92] Go.
[1251.88] Go from here, come on. 
Leave from here.
[1264.60] Hey, why are you standing here like
 a stubborn person in front of me.
[1268.00] Why don’t you get lost?
[1270.52] What do you want?
What do you want?
[1273.08] Your mother too should die 
like your father.
[1276.28] That’s what you want, right? 
Kill me.
[1278.48] Why don’t you kill me?
No. No. God forbid.
[1281.44] God forbid, something happens to you.
[1283.04] I pray that I get killed in your place.
[1285.12] God forbid, I lose you.
[1287.08] You feel I did all this. 
All this is my responsibility.
[1290.48] You kill me, you choke me with
 your hands, so that I die.
[1294.40] I want to die. 
Mama, I cannot tolerate it.
[1297.40] Okay enough. Okay be quiet.
[1299.36] Every one is taunting me, 
they are insulting me, they are cursing me.
[1305.04] Mama, what do you people think?
[1308.12] The groom’s family went back,
[1309.96] I made a scene out of in front of everyone.
[1312.52] I have been insulted in front of everyone. 
Do I not have pain?
[1316.84] Okay….
Do I not suffer?
[1318.28] I am really sad.
[1319.64] My papa leave me and went, mama.
[1321.88] I am in a lot of pain. 
I feel my heart will stop beating.
[1325.32] I cannot tolerate what everyone is saying.
[1327.16] That’s it, stop.
[1330.16] Your mother is still alive.
[1331.92] No one will say anything to you. 
No one will say anything.
[1366.68] Annie, come quickly.
[1369.64] Yes, mama?
[1371.12] Take this food to sister in law’s room.
[1374.28] She is in mourning,
 she cannot come here.
[1376.20] And listen,
[1377.52] call Ramsha upstairs too 
we will all sit and eat together.
[1380.24] No need to call that girl upstairs.
[1383.68] Just send her food to her room.
[1389.32] Anwar, what is wrong with you?
[1392.40] Brother Sajid hasn’t been gone for long.
[1395.88] Ramsha is really sad,
[1398.40] I saw her crying often.
[1400.92] So she is crying because of her actions.
[1408.32] Had she not done all this,
[1410.52] then today we wouldn’t have had 
to see this day.
[1414.44] Anyway,
[1415.52] what is the point of taunting her like this?
 She made a mistake,
[1419.08] and brother Sajid forgave her, 
sister in law has forgiven her.
[1423.36] Who are we to taunt her like this?
[1426.68] Yes, so forgiving her was
 their helplessness.
[1435.76] After all, she is their only daughter,
and they did this for her.
[1438.84] But did you see the result of it?
[1447.64] Elder papa had his first heart 
and he passed away.
[1457.68] This is what she has done to them.
[1459.40] Mr. Shani, even your mother wants
[1463.28] that we forgive Ramsha and 
take her tension on our heads.
[1472.32] And we meet a similar end hearing 
the taunts of people.
[1475.64] We have the first heart attack 
and we die.
[1478.44] Hey, fear God. What are you saying?
[1481.80] I didn’t mean that at all.
[1484.40] You have taken the discussion 
in such a wrong direction.
[1491.00] Have food at least.
 Come on.
[1493.96] I will not forgive that girl, that’s it.
[1527.68] Ramsha. 
Yes?
[1529.32] What are you doing so early 
in the morning?
[1531.16] I am making chicken rice.
[1532.96] Mama had told me to make chicken rice
and distribute it amongst the poor.
[1535.80] Fine.
[1537.92] In fact, Annie, you do one thing,
[1541.56] you go and tell Shani to distribute 
this rice in our neighbourhood.
[1546.08] Our neighbours are not that rich.
[1548.64] Everyone has six to seven children 
in their home.
[1550.60] It is good everyone will get food.
[1552.88] We will get blessed.
[1559.16] What happened? 
What are you thinking?
[1562.00] I am thinking that the neighbours 
who talk so much against you,
[1566.52] you are thinking so much for them.
[1570.12] Look Annie,
[1571.84] the more the mouths, the more people talk.
[1573.48] Who all will we shut up?
[1576.36] After all, if someone is talking let them,
[1579.92] them talking wont make us bad.
[1585.32] It feels like elder papa is talking.
[1589.08] Really? Do you feel that way?
[1591.28] Yes,
[1592.44] the tone in which you are talking, 
it feels that elder papa is talking.
[1597.36] Just like him.
[1598.88] Man, elder papa was really good.
[1602.12] Along with you, he would really
take care of me too.
[1605.40] The home is really lonely after him.
[1608.40] You are absolutely right.
[1611.28] Papa was really very good.
[1615.76] The home is really lonely after he left.
[1618.92] The home doesn’t look like home.
[1623.16] Anyway, will you chop the onions, 
please?
[1626.00] Yes, I will.
[1627.04] The food will be ready quickly.
[1633.16] Anwar. 
Yes?
[1634.48] Ramsha was saying that
[1637.76] sister in law’s medication has run out,
she needs money.
[1641.40] Really?
[1643.64] Tell her to give me the prescription, 
I will get it on my way back.
[1648.04] Fine, I will ask her, but…
[1654.80] But, what?
[1657.96] Sister in law has asked one or two times
about the earnings of the shop indirectly.
[1680.88] Did sister in law say this to you herself?
[1685.40] No, but I understood what she meant.
[1689.80] Okay,
[1692.04] then also understand what I am saying.
[1695.28] Keep your understanding to yourself
[1699.32] and don’t talk any useless thing.
[1702.80] If something like this happens, 
then I am here.
[1705.12] I will talk to sister in law again.
[1707.68] And after today, 
don’t say anything like this.
[1712.64] What do you understand?
Anwar, what did I say?
[1715.84] I told you what she said.
[1717.60] What you say, I will tell her.
[1720.84] I didn’t say anything on my own.
[1723.36] For no reason. 
What did you say?
[1725.84] Before going give me money for meat.
[1729.72] I have to cook food.
[1730.92] Your son is unable to eat vegetables, 
he only eats meat,
[1733.88] and I don’t have money for meat.
[1735.56] Yes, the meat will come.
[1738.24] You or your son shouldn’t worry.
[1770.16] Thank you.
[1771.68] Shani, this seems like medication 
for a few days.
[1775.36] Papa, asked me to get medication 
for two days, so I got it for two days.
[1777.72] Yes, but I didn’t ask uncle for two days.
[1780.24] I told him I want medication for a week.
[1782.96] I am telling you, what papa told me I did.
[1785.72] I got it for two days.
[1787.84] Fine, I will talk to him myself. 
Hello.
[1790.48] Where are you going?
[1791.72] I am going to talk to uncle.
I will tell him,
[1793.80] I don’t need medication for two days, 
I want them for a week.
[1795.84] Papa is at the shop.
[1797.08] Talk to him when he comes in the evening.
[1799.48] Fine, take out your phone,
[1801.76] ask uncle, when you have to get 
the remaining medication. Call him.
[1804.88] I don’t have balance to waste.
[1806.84] If you want, you can call 
from your own phone.
[1809.08] So…
[1849.48] Aunt, I was coming to you.
[1852.60] all okay, child?
Is everything fine?
[1853.72] What happened? 
Why are you worried?
[1855.00] I had asked Shani to get medication
for mama for a week,
[1858.56] he got it for two days only.
[1860.24] I am even calling uncle, 
he is not answering.
[1863.96] Okay,
[1866.64] I will call your uncle.
[1869.32] If I talk to him, then I will ask him.
[1871.28] Fine, thank you. But aunt,
[1873.52] the doctor has strictly said that mama 
needs to take her medication on time.
[1877.16] Even if a day’s dose is missed, 
mama can get unwell.
[1880.40] You please talk to him and 
get the medication.
[1882.84] Child, do one thing, give the prescription
 for the medication.
[1885.68] I will tell Shani, he will get you 
more medication.
[1889.96] Aunt, we need this medication for a 
week and this for five days.
[1892.68] Okay fine.
[1893.76] I am going to mama with the medication.
[1919.32] Greetings, papa.
[1920.48] Greetings, how are you?
[1922.96] Give it to me, should I take it?
No, it is fine.
[1925.00] Where is Shani?
[1927.76] He is not at home.
[1929.08] I had asked him to come and pick me,
but he didn’t come.
[1932.24] I don’t know. You call him and ask.
[1934.28] What is the point of calling him?
His phone is always engaged.
[1938.24] He keeps his phone busy like 
he is running factories.
[1942.96] Papa, you must be tired, 
get fresh, I will serve food.
[1946.56] Where is your mother?
[1949.04] She went to aunt Shahida’s home.
[1951.56] Why?
[1952.84] She had a grandson.
[1956.40] Your mother cannot stay at home.
[1959.84] At times someone’s funeral
[1961.36] and then at times someone has had a child.
[1963.28] Call her and tell her to come back home,
I have come back.
[1966.24] In fact, do one thing, let me talk 
to her on the phone.
[1969.40] Sure.
[1986.00] Greetings.
[1988.48] mama, I am going to university.
[1991.28] I will continue my studies,
[1993.80] it was papa’s dream
[1997.64] that I complete my graduation and 
achieve something in life.
[2003.96] That’s why I will go to university 
from today and study.
[2007.56] Go child.
[2009.24] May God give you success. 
Go come on.
[2011.92] Thank you, mama. 
Goodbye.
[2014.68] I wish you had gotten this smart 
in brother Sajid’s life.
[2032.92] That poor thing left the world asking you
[2036.48] to study and work hard,
[2039.88] but you…
[2049.52] You never got free from that fashion, 
mobile and videos.
[2055.92] Sister in law, you see the environment
of the home and what it has become.
[2058.76] I cannot say anything, 
I cannot do anything.
[2066.68] Mama, she…
[2067.76] Stop it child. Be quiet.
[2069.64] Look, I don’t want that we have 
an argument early in the morning.
[2076.76] Your father hasn’t been gone for long.
[2080.04] People will talk for no reason. 
You just be quiet.
