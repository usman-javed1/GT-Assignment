The personality we will make you 
meet today, all of you want to meet her. Yes, you people must have understood. We will make you all meet Ramsha. Come please, in your huge applause. Greetings. Greetings. How are you? I am absolutely fine. 
How are you? I am fine. Really pretty 
since childhood, I have never been proud of it. 
Aunty, how are you? Yes, I am fine too. Great. We welcome you two 
to our show. mama. Mama. Hey, what happened? 
Why are you making noise? Mama it is 9 am, 
what are you doing here? The morning show must have begun. Ramsha looks really pretty. I thought you would be watching the show. Hey, it is 9 am? I didn’t realize 
while working. Come on switch on the TV quickly. Turn on the TV quickly.  
We will watch the show. Quickly. Oh God. Where is it? I don’t see the remote. I don’t know where Shani kept the remote,
 the time will pass. You know, Ramsha looks really pretty, 
it feels like an actress is sitting. And elder mama also looks really pretty. Really?
Here it is. Good you told me or I wouldn’t have
 realized while working. Hey, don’t sit. Take this. 
Go quickly. Let me watch, mama Go, turn off the stove. 
The rice is on it. Aunty, you have left Ramsha 
behind as well. Your make over is really good. And our makeup artist doesn’t do 
such good makeup on us, they did a good job on aunty. Ramsha, how does it feel over night… See, sister in law Mehnaz 
looks so pretty. I feel along with Ramsha, 
they have done her make up too. Yes, a great makeup did their makeup. I spoke to Ramsha before the show started. What is the name? I will tell you after the break. 
Right now watch the show. She was saying she wanted to come 
to my show to take selfies. Oh wow, great. Aunt, how do you feel? Your daughter has got so much fame. 
What do you think? Yes, since childhood 
she had an interest, we used to stop her. But now she has so much fame. Everyone recognizes her. Hey, then what? I insulted them badly. They said this is our makeup artist, he will do Ramsha’s makeup. Boy. I told them don’t you dare have a male
 makeup artist does my daughter’s makeup. You know Salma, 
there is a shameless fashion, boys do the makeup. Oh God, God forbid. Sister in law, you did good. You did good that you insulted them. There is one thing, Salma. Those people welcomed us a lot. Hey, they treated us so well, 
what do I tell you? They made us sit 
in a separate AC room. The people who sit in the audience 
and clap, they were sitting separately. But they made us sit 
in a separate AC room and her assistant would come 
to me again and again and ask me if I want, tea, 
coffee, juice, water. Hey, the breakfast they got us. Nothing was missing in that breakfast. They really served us well. I really liked watching it all. Really sister in law? Yes, if you were there then you would
have seen everything with your eyes. Hey, I really wanted to go. I had so much fun. 
Yes, the clothes they gave us to wear were so grand, 
what do I tell you. Yes, so? Did you not see, I played two games with sister Shiza and you know we took so many selfies, we talked so much, 
that you cannot imagine. You know she was telling me 
that I am really talented and I can also be a good actress
in future. What? Acting? Talk slowly. If mama and aunt hear you, 
it will be an issue. Yes, she was saying that after seeing this interview, 
I will get a lot of acting offers. Ramsha, it was fine till 
the morning show, but you don’t think about acting. What is wrong, Annie? You know when I was there… Afnan, I am serious. Hey, if you didn’t have time 
you could have seen it in repeat. You know my happiness 
doesn’t matter to you, I have seen it. Hey, I don’t understand how do you
 find happiness in such things. Okay fine, for your happiness, you do one thing, send me 
the link of that show, I will watch it. Hey, now I send you the link, even? If I don’t send you the link 
you wont watch it? Hey talking to you is like talking 
to a small child. You know I have no interest
 in these things. I have no interest. If you send me the link it will be
 easy for me to watch it. Fine, I will send it. But do watch it, please. 
Don’t forget. Ramsha, I couldn’t recognize you. You know, you have so many chances
 to move forward. I would say stay in contact 
with these media people, you will see you will get such good offers. I want that too, but you know my family. I got permission to go to the morning show
with so much difficulty, how will they let me act? So tell your mother and father, to change themselves and 
their thinking because this is something
 ordinary nowadays. This happening is impossible. It is not possible that my family’s 
thinking changes. Okay listen, I have a cousin Shahmir. He has a modeling agency. 
Maybe you have heard the name. He needs a beautiful model 
for a new project he is launching. If you want, I can talk to him. 
Because he really liked you. Me? Modeling? Me and modeling? 
How is that possible Hania? Yes, so what is the harm in that? So what if you do a photoshoot 
for one magazine? And if you want you can also 
hide this from your parents. Because he is giving a 
really good package. Hania… The offer is really good, 
rest is up to you. Hania, modeling, hiding 
from mama and papa? No, no, I cannot do that. I don’t do anything hiding it from them
and it is not possible. Yes, so Ramsha, you will not come on the TV screen, that they will find out everything. It is just a small photoshoot. Rest I will stay with you, why do you have to worry? Okay, I will bring juice for you. Don’t worry. Ramsha. Ramsha, where did you… Ramsha, where did you keep 
my economics book? Ramsha, where is my economics book? I am asking you something. What is the problem? A person cannot calmly think about 
something in this home. Where is my economics book? It is kept on the side table in my room,
go take it and don’t bother me. By the way, why are you lost in deep thoughts? I am asking you. 
What are you thinking? hey, I am not thinking anything. 
Go get your book and don’t bother me. I am sure something is going on 
in your head. God knows, what you will do now, 
but you are surely thinking of something. The day spent talking about 
the Prophet are the best days, the days spent in the memories 
of the Prophet, there is no better night than that. I spent great time. All the worldly blessings given 
by God on one side, but the most precious thing 
that a person has is their time and then that time that is spent 
for God thinking about God is greater than all blessings. Believe me, you get to learn at every step, you get a chance to improve yourself. I am going to turn sixty and I was making mistakes 
in my namaz, for years. I didn’t realize it. Going there I realized that the knowledge
 of the religion is so important. These responsibilities of ours, we should be able to fulfill them properly, but it will only be possible when we find out about them, we try. We make effort. In fact, Afnan, I will tell you as well, what is left lacking in my life, shouldn’t be left lacking in your life. You too gain knowledge of the religion. In fact, Mr. Awais was telling me he has 
started some small courses in the evening, so you do a small course. Yes, dad. I will try my best. Afsheen, I was saying that we should
 get Afnan and Alizay married now. It is a good deed, we shouldn’t delay it.
What do you say? Absolutely right, brother. Alizay is your daughter. After all, she doesn’t have to go 
to another home after marriage. Uncle. I am sorry uncle. I am not ready to get married right now. I need some time. Right now, I am focusing on my career. That’s why I cannot get married. Excuse me. Alizay, child, listen to me. Brother, you know Alizay is a child 
right now. Hearing about her marriage 
she got a little confused. But you don’t worry, 
I will make her understand. Afnan, you don’t worry at all. You and Alizay will be married soon. Brother, I will go check on her. Ramsha, look, if you think so much,
then believe me, you wont be able to do anything 
in your life. People have to progress 
so much in life. They want everything in life. Money, wealth, fame. Everything. And you? You are getting all this easily, then why are you thinking so much? People have to make so much effort 
to get to this point, they have to put in hard work, they have to ask people for work 
at different place, and you? You are thinking so much. You know, before today, 
I was never this scared in life, like I got scared today. My papa really loves me. 
He loves me a lot. But he is equally angry 
as he loves me. I am scared that if someone 
in my home finds out a little, then I am a goner. 
They will take my life. No one will find out anything. Okay tell me, does your family read the magazines? No. Does anyone read the newspaper?
Do you get a newspaper? Yes, but no one reads it. This photoshoot is for a fashion magazine, that your family wont see. 
Then what is the issue? You know cousin is offering you
three hundred thousand for this photoshoot. Three hundred thousand 
for a photoshoot? Three hundred thousand. 
I spoke to him myself. He gives an ordinary model
one hundred and fifty thousand. And you? You are the shopping girl, he is offering you three hundred thousand 
himself. So what is the issue? Look, think about this and I want an answer today, because I have to give him 
the final answer today. Alizay, what career do you want to make? Afnan and brother have
their own business and all this will be yours. Then why are you wasting 
your time making your career? Mama, why don’t you understand, I never want to be dependent on anyone. I want to make a name for myself. And God forbid, 
if I become alone in future, I don’t want that like you I have to live 
on uncle’s support or someone’s support. What are you saying, Alizay? Think what you are saying 
before you speak. Mama, try and understand. I know uncle didn’t leave 
you deprived of anything and he never showed his favour to you
 that you live with him. But the world is not like uncle and to walk in this world it is necessary 
for me make myself strong. When am I saying that 
I will not get married? I love Afnan myself, mama. I am just asking you for some time. Alizay, have you thought? What will you do, if Afnan likes some
 other girl in the time you are asking for? Why are you laughing? 
I am not joking. Mama, what you are saying 
is no less than a joke. Mama, Afnan can give his life for me. He cannot go far from me. Where are you Afnan? Yes, I am in the office.
 Why? All okay? Yes, I actually wanted to go out so brother took the car and went, 
so I thought I would go with you. Oh, I am really busy, 
I have back to back meetings. If you want I will coordinate with the driver,
he will come to you. No, no, it is alright, 
I will manage. Goodbye. Mama. Alizay, There are a lot of girls who can give
 their lives for a capable, rich and handsome boy. Try and understand what I am saying. Sit here. Now tell me, what were you saying? What would I say? But, it was fine till the morning show, this modeling…elder mama, 
elder papa will never agree. Nothing will happen, Annie.
No one will find out anything. I will just got two to three hours, and my shoot will end 
in two to three hours. I will go during university time 
and Hania is coming with me. You know how much money 
I am getting for this shoot? I am getting three hundred thousand 
for this shoot. Who is telling you that you are getting 
three hundred thousand? You think I am stupid? I spoke to Hania completely. She told me that she will come 
with me during university timing and I am just telling you all this, that once the class is over 
you look around for me. You have to wait for me. I will get the shoot done and come back,
 and we will come together like we do daily. If you don’t care about yourself, 
but care about me. Even if someone finds out, 
we will get beaten so badly, that you cannot imagine. You are not going anywhere, sit here. I am not asking you, I am telling you and if you don’t want to come 
with me, then don’t. I cannot live this life, it is clear. I have to kill my wishes in this. I have to do this shoot and move forward. 
I have to make my future Annie. Ramsha, God has given you 
so many blessings. People don’t even have these. 
Thank God. I don’t want to argue with you 
on anything. I have decided that I am getting 
the shoot done for the magazine, so this means I am getting it done. Think about it. Afnan, it is good I found you here. 
I was coming to talk to you. I too wanted to talk to you too. And Alizay I want that you not only listen to me, 
but also accept it. Afnan, you know you cannot 
boss me around. Yes, you can surely request me, I will also listen to you and if I understand, 
I might accept it too. Why are you doing this? What do you want? Alizay, you have every blessing 
in the world. If you want something, then tell me,
I will put it in your feet. But don’t do all this. Afnan, please, what are you saying? These things sound good in books,
but in practical life? All this doesn’t work in practical life and I was coming to you that I am going
 to Islamabad for a month from the office. I have got an approval letter. What? You are going to Islamabad and 
you are telling me this right now. What is wrong, Afnan? 
Why are you reacting like this? I wanted to surprise everyone 
on the dining table, but uncle was talking 
so I couldn’t speak. I thought you would be happy…
I don’t care. I don’t care what you were thinking and you know what? You are the most selfish person 
in the world, who doesn’t see anything about 
anyone in front of your happiness. Hey, if someone is getting pain from you 
or they are tortured, it doesn’t matter to you. You want to go to Islamabad, right? You leave. Hey not for a month, go for a year, 
if you want you can go for all your life, it doesn’t matter to me now. Okay. Okay Hania, fine, tell them 
I am reaching in a little while. Yes, I will come in a little while. Okay, bye. Goodbye. Come on. You wont learn. Why? You are jealous of me? You are jealous that I am getting 
three hundred thousand? What? I will be jealous of your money? You said something cheap, Ramsha. Okay Annie, what is wrong? Okay, let’s do one thing, the three hundred thousand I get, 
I will give you ten thousand out of it, okay? Thank you very much, 
I don’t want your ten thousand. Okay, lets do one thing, I will take you shopping and 
you can buy what you want, I will pay the bill. What? Now I cannot give you the entire 
three hundred thousand, madam. You get over. Come on. Come on.
Ramsha, I have no interest in your money, but I am just trying to make you 
understand to be smart. If elder papa finds out 
he will break your legs. If my brother and papa find out,
they will cut my throat. Ramsha. Hey… Mama, I was coming to tell you that I will come a little late. Because I have a practical 
after the classes. Annie will get off soon, so Annie 
will come home herself. Okay, Annie? Okay, call me, I will send your father, 
come with him. You don’t need to come alone. No mama! I mean, what is the need 
to inform papa? He is on the shop at that time. 
He will worry for no reason. I will have my friends with me, 
they will drop me back after the practical. Okay, you two are getting late, come on, go. Come on. Come on Annie.
Goodbye, mama. Goodbye.
Goodbye. May God protect you. I was coming to you that I am going
to Islamabad for a month from the office. I have got an approval letter. What? You are going to Islamabad and 
you are telling me this right now. What is wrong, Afnan? 
Why are you reacting like this? I wanted to surprise everyone 
on the dining table, but uncle was talking 
so I couldn’t speak. I thought you would be happy…
I don’t care. I don’t care what you were thinking. Don’t think so much, 
your breakfast is getting cold. Afnan, please try to understand. You are asking me to understand. This means you have decided to go, 
you wont stop. Okay, you don’t get upset with me. How can I not get upset? I asked you so many times, 
you don’t go. My heart doesn’t agree. 
But you… You know, you take undue advantage
of my love and I am telling you that 
if you don’t stop , then I… Then what? What man? What can I do? I can do nothing with you. I love you.
Afnan, you know what I like the most 
about you? No matter how upset you are with me, 
you cannot leave me. And see, I was thinking that 
you will understand me, in fact, you will also make
 mama understand. This is a big opportunity for me. I don’t want to miss it. It is just a matter of a month. I will come back immediately 
after getting the work done. Please Afnan, please. Please. Okay, have breakfast. Will you have tea?
Yes. Give it. Have you seen such a future husband, who even after fighting so much…. Perfect. Your face, your looks are perfect 
for the camera. We were looking for such a girl. I had talked to Hania that call this girl,
she has talent. That is why… Hey, I took her name and she is calling.
She has a long life. Yes, Hania. Yes, Shahmir, how are you? I am fine and the madam is sitting
in front of me. I am talking to her. The girl you sent is really good. I really liked her. That’s why I introduced you to Ramsha. Shahmir, Ramsha has a lot of talent. I would say if she comes in this field, 
she will leave all the other girls behind. Yes, you know, all the famous actors and models 
who work with out famous agency, where they are today. You remember Alisha? Yes, yes, I remember her. No one knew her, I did her first shoot 
with my own hands. Yes. Fine. Fine, okay, I will talk to her 
about business. Okay fine, perfect. Okay bye. Alisha. She is a big actress. 
Did you do her first shoot? Yes, she came to me first time, 
no one knew her. I did her shoot myself and today, 
see, she is earning millions. This is what happens in this field. If you go and ask her if she knows me, she will refuse it. Because when people get a name, they refused to recognize others. This is the biggest issue of this field. You wont do this with me, right? No, no, I am not like that. When someone does a favor on me, 
I never forget their favor. Good. Anyway, now it is time for a friend of mine to come,
I have to spend time with him. So I want that we do the shoot 
after that. Let me call Fiza. Yes, Fiza, come inside. Yeah. Yes, come in. Yes, sir.
Yes, Fiza, you know she is. Yes, sir, who doesn’t know her? She is really famous by the name 
of shopping girl. Then you take her and make her ready. I will meet you people after the meeting. We have to do the shoot. Come on, Miss Ramsha.
Sure. The mobile is really good, man. 
When did you get it? Is it new. You know your brother never 
gets anything used. I got a new box packed piece 
for sixty thousand rupees. You got a mobile for sixty thousand? You know the prices of mobiles 
are increasing daily. I liked the camera of it, so I got it. What do I tell you? 
Even I want to change my mobile. I had showed my mobile to a friend, he told me take thirty thousand for it. But now if I have to get such a mobile, where will I get the remaining 
thirty thousand from? If I ask papa, there is no chance and there is nothing happening 
at the shop, it is the end of the month, how will it happen? Look brother, I got a contract 
for one fifty thousand. And I need a helper and you can also do the work 
of an electrician. What do you say? 
Will you come along with me? What do you mean? 
I come along with you? Then who will take care of the shop? Oh man, papa is there. Papa and uncle will handle it together. It is a matter of two to three days, and I will give you thirty thousand 
for this work. You will give me thirty thousand 
for this job? |Hey, yes, you are my friend. If I don’t do it for you, 
then who will I do it for? You have time till the evening. 
Tell me as soon as possible. I will tell you. 
Show me your phone. Thank God, buddy, 
you showed me your face. Or else everyone just calls 
when they need me. You disappeared like in university, 
we were… you know what they say? 
The horns on a donkey. There is nothing like that, buddy. You know dad has put all the responsibility
 of the business on me. I spend my entire day in the office. I don’t have four brothers like you that if one brother is not there, 
the other will come. It is just me. Should I work or 
should I meet friends? Leave it, man. This love of brothers. Nowadays, everyone is concerned 
about themselves, no one belongs to anyone. This is just words. A person should be like you, completely free, relaxed. These talks of family, the issues with each other,
it is a lot of tension. What can I say? I think no person is happy 
in their place. What do I say, man? 
That’s it. Listen, can I see this? Yes. Yes. Do you even need to ask? Who is this girl? My new model. Maybe you would have seen her video. She is really viral by the name 
of Shopping girl. Coincidentally she is in the studio 
right now. You know how much I need such girls. They want fame and I want profit. Anyway, you tell me, 
do you know her? Me? How would I know her? I have no relation with these models. I may have seen the viral video 
you are mentioning. The face seemed familiar. Yes, it is right. Okay listen, I will leave. Dad must be waiting, 
there is a lot of work. Sit, man, you just came. 
Tea, cold drink, we will have food. I will come again.
I will come again. Okay? Okay, then. Take care. See you.
