[16.04] You did good that you sent
your friend from there.
[18.20] I had to talk to you about
a lot of things as well.
[20.16] Hey, you could have talked
in front of him too.
[22.60] No, I don’t like talking to you
in front of anyone.
[26.84] By the way, tell me something,
[28.72] where is my gift?
[30.72] Madam,
[31.72] the flowers I got are your gift.
[34.48] This?
[35.12] Yes.
[35.76] I don’t want flowers,
these will die by tomorrow.
[39.00] Oh wow.
[40.68] You know there is something,
[42.04] at times you are really logical.
[45.08] These flowers will die till tomorrow.
[47.28] Then lets do one thing,
[48.76] your gift is due on me.
[51.80] Are you sure?
[52.60] Sure.
[56.40] Okay listen,
[57.92] I will have to go now.
[59.48] You know, I have to pick dad too.
[61.56] You are leaving right now?
[63.08] No, nothing like that is happening,
[65.12] you will sit and talk to me
about a lot of things.
[67.08] Hey, we will continue to talk.
We talk.
[69.56] But I have to pick dad,
he gets upset, it won’t look nice.
[72.56] Fine, go.
[74.00] You don’t care about me at all.
[75.52] This proves that I am not important
for you at all.
[85.80] This is Shani’s cousin.
[88.32] What is she doing here?
[95.00] Really?
[97.04] Look at me.
[99.96] Hey, look at me.
[103.80] Yes?
[107.44] If you were not important for me,
[110.84] then I wouldn’t be here today.
[115.04] Okay. Okay. Stop it.
[117.60] Okay see, the videos for today.
[138.88] Yes, go ahead.
[140.00] Where the hell are you? You know
everyone here is getting so angry.
[142.96] There is a limit to selfishness, man.
[144.48] You don’t care about anyone.
[146.08] Hey, my love, Annie, I am really sorry,
[148.20] you know what happened?
[148.84] Afnan came so late,
I was meeting him so I got late.
[151.48] I will come in a while.
[152.72] To hell with Afnan,
you come home soon.
[155.52] Okay, I am coming.
You wait for ten minutes.
[158.80] Come soon.
[160.52] Okay bye. Okay bye.
[161.56] Hania,
[162.52] I am quickly picking my bag,
changing and coming.
[164.24] You wait here, I am coming
in two minutes. Wait.
[165.84] Come quickly.
[168.68] It is already so late.
[193.08] Greetings.
[194.52] Greetings.
[195.76] Where were you till now? Huh?
[198.56] Do you have any idea?
[202.16] And where is your phone?
[204.36] I have called you a thousand times,
you are not answering your phone.
[208.04] Do you even care about our worry or not?
[211.72] And you don’t care about your father at all
that how worried he would be cause of you.
[215.76] What is wrong, mama?
[217.56] I had told you and papa that
I am going to the hospital.
[221.60] I didn’t go to have fun,
that you are scolding me so much.
[224.32] Really?
[225.64] If I don’t scold you, then
what do I do? Huh?
[227.28] First you made a mistake,
and then you are making noise too.
[231.04] Hey, I feel I shouldn’t have allowed you
to go to the hospital.
[235.40] Papa,
[236.40] look, make mama understand.
[238.12] She is scolding me for so long.
[239.64] Keeping the phone on silent in
the hospital was my helplessness.
[243.16] I went to help someone,
[244.72] I couldn’t leave the work
incomplete and come.
[248.04] Still you should have informed us, child.
[251.32] Me and your mama were so worried here.
[253.72] God knows where all Shani
looked for you and came.
[257.08] Now why did Shani go to look for me?
[259.40] Did I run away from home?
[261.32] I didn’t go to have fun,
I went to the hospital, right?
[264.24] Be quiet, for God’s sake.
[266.56] And don’t you dare 
misbehave like this again.
[270.00] Hey, I told the poor thing search for you.
[273.32] He took Annie to Savera’s 
home to look for you,
[276.04] but Annie forgot where Savera lives.
[278.44] The poor thing had to face so much worry.
[281.28] Oh, I feel Annie has 
become smart living with me.
[286.00] What?
[287.08] What did you say?
[288.08] Speak up.
[289.32] Nothing.
[291.56] You said something.
No,
[292.68] I was just saying I am so sorry,
[294.36] I will not do anything like this
after today. I promise.
[296.92] Nothing like this will happen after today.
[298.32] Papa, I apologize to you too.
[300.00] Please you two forgive me.
[301.64] I promise, I will not do 
anything like this again.
[304.36] Don’t give me a chance to complain again.
[307.20] For sure. Thank you so much.
[312.68] Come on.
[324.00] You know man, you were right,
[325.88] I had a lot of fun there.
[327.44] Hmm.
[328.36] I was seeing that you too 
were enjoying a lot with your friend.
[331.68] Hey thank God man,
[332.80] you called her my friend,
not my girlfriend.
[336.00] Yes, I didn’t say it,
[337.28] but she was considering herself your girlfriend.
[341.64] Man, she has no fault in this.
[343.88] She is an immature girl.
[345.68] Now whether she considers herself
my girlfriend or friend,
[348.16] I don’t have so much time
to make her understand.
[351.24] Hey brother, I have time.
[353.16] Hey, you are Tarzan,
you have time for every girl.
[359.00] Who are you two talking about and laughing?
[361.72] This is something the elders are discussing,
[363.48] children shouldn’t interfere.
You please leave.
[365.56] Yes,  you two are really grown up.
[367.80] I think I will have to complain
to uncle about you.
[370.40] Yes, absolutely right.
[371.56] Actually, I have told dad everything,
[374.04] that is why as a punishment,
dad is going to get me married to a witch.
[379.76] I am leaving, I have to go to
the office in the morning.
[382.20] Goodnight.
[382.76] Hey, what is wrong? Listen to me.
[385.20] Listen to me. What is wrong?
[386.44] What is there to mind.
[389.12] Brother, I will come in two minutes.
[391.04] No, no, it won’t take two minute,
[393.04] I know. It will take an hour.
[394.92] I will leave now. You go ahead.
[396.64] Really?
Yes.
[397.52] Okay, let’s meet tomorrow.
Okay.
[398.76] Okay, take care. Bye.
Bye.
[409.20] Yes, tell me.
[410.92] Why did you call me immediately?
Is all okay?
[413.76] All is not fine.
[415.32] Your cousin, your uncle’s daughter.
[419.36] Ramsha?
[420.60] Yes, yes, the same.
[422.00] I saw her in my restaurant.
[424.00] Maybe she was having a party.
[426.20] It was a birthday party.
[427.76] Her friends were there and also
two boys came later on.
[431.60] You are mistaken, it cannot be her.
[434.16] And listen, don’t say something like this
about my cousin in future,
[436.76] understand?
[438.12] I am speaking the truth, man.
[439.92] She was your cousin.
[441.72] I recognize her well.
[447.56] Oh, Salma,
[449.56] how many times have I told you
to add less sugar in the tea.
[452.88] Oh sorry, I forgot.
[455.00] and you too have less sugar.
[457.08] Okay.
[461.24] Ramsha.
[463.16] Ramsha.
[465.00] Mama, where is Ramsha?
[466.40] I don’t know, son.
[468.00] What happened?
[471.64] What happened?
[474.04] What happened?
[476.24] Listen to me. What happened?
[479.04] What happened to him?
[480.36] I don’t know.
[481.32] Come, let’s see. Come.
[483.08] Come. Come on. 
Come on. Come on.
[487.88] Hearing this I am really happy, Annie.
[489.92] You cannot imagine.
[490.92] You did really good that you
made Shani go around aimlessly.
[493.20] He deserves this.
[494.16] After all,
[495.80] you have become really
smart staying with me.
[498.32] You did well. Good girl.
[500.64] Thank God I saved you.
[502.36] Instead of making fun of
my brother, accept my favour.
[504.96] Yes, yes, yes, yes,
[506.36] you have done me so many favours,
[509.04] that I am being burdened under your favours.
[512.20] I am thinking that
[513.76] I will feed you ice cream
and pay off all your favours?
[517.48] Hmmm.
[518.44] Ice cream, and you?
[520.80] Yes, so? What is in it?
[522.88] Ramsha.
[523.84] Ramsha.
What happened to him?
[528.16] Where did you go yesterday?
[531.00] I am asking you something,
where did you go yesterday?
[534.40] I…
[534.92] I…
[536.36] Talk calmly.
[538.52] I will not talk calmly,
[539.88] tell me, where were you yesterday?
[543.44] Tell me!
[544.56] Lower your voice.
[546.00] After all, I went to my friend’s home yesterday
[548.12] and I informed mama
and went. Come, come
[549.80] and ask her. Come on.
Don’t lie.
[555.40] Yes, yes, Mr. Ashfaq,
I am forwarding you this email.
[558.16] Okay. Okay.
[559.40] Just two minutes. Okay, bye.
[561.68] Afnan,
[563.28] I am hungry.
[564.92] We get a one hour lunch break
and you wasted fifteen minutes from it.
[568.88] If you didn’t want to go to for lunch,
[569.88] then you should have told me,
I would have gone myself.
[571.32] Hey, I am standing here
and working because of you.
[574.20] Now what more do I do than this?
Just give me two minutes, we will go.
[576.80] Afnan, you…
[577.92] Come in.
[583.32] Sir, this required your signature.
[589.44] This? One million?
[592.00] Sir, Sir Qasim got this issued for
some religious school,
[595.16] he wanted to get AC installed there.
[596.96] Fine, leave.
[599.12] Listen.
[599.76] Yes?
[600.92] Is dad in his office?
[602.12] Yes, he is in his room.
[604.00] Fine, you leave.
[607.32] People are fooling uncle well.
[611.24] At times with one name
and at times with another.
[616.32] They take advantage of his simplicity.
[621.48] Anyway,
[623.48] are you coming or not?
[625.56] Just one minute, let me forward this email.
[627.72] I am going, if you want to come, then come.
[629.92] You wait in the car. I am coming.
[647.96] mama, look at Shani.
[649.16] See, he is putting a false allegation on me.
[650.76] I had told you yesterday that
I went to my friend’s home.
[652.96] I had told you, right?
She is lying.
[654.88] She was at the restaurant yesterday,
[657.20] and her friends were not the only ones there,
[658.84] there were two boys with her too.
[660.36] Ask her.
[661.20] Shani, what are you saying?
[663.68] Elder mama, I am not lying.
[664.64] My friend works there, he told me.
He saw everything.
[667.80] What is Shani saying?
[668.76] Mama, he is lying.
[672.40] I had told you that Savera’s mother is unwell
[674.92] and I have to take her to the hospital,
[676.40] then why would I go to the restaurant?
[678.84] And after all,
[680.24] his friend must have seen someone else
[682.08] and he is blaming me for no reason.
[686.88] Ramsha,
[692.12] tell me the truth, what is the matter?
[696.60] papa, I am speaking the truth….
One minute,
[700.00] before you say anything,
[705.64] think well that if this is a lie,
[711.80] then it will be torturous for you
and embarrassment for me.
[715.28] Tell us.
[716.84] Papa,
[718.24] I am speaking the truth.
[720.00] I was with my friend,
I was at her home.
[722.76] I am speaking the truth,
it is not a lie…
[724.04] you should be ashamed, you are lying
so blatantly in front of everyone.
[726.80] Hey, you should be ashamed.
[729.00] You believe your friend and not me?
[732.12] It is something for you to die.
[734.48] You listened to your friend
and put an allegation on me.
[738.84] Hey, so what if I am not your sister,
[740.64] I am your cousin.
[741.76] A cousin is like a sister too.
[747.28] And you people don’t believe me, right?
[749.28] Mama, you come to Savera’s home
with me right now,
[752.08] and ask her yourself.
[754.04] When she will tell you the truth,
then you people will find out.
[756.68] It is good that everyone will find out
what is my respect and worth in the home.
[759.68] Come on.
[760.12] Come with me right now.
No need to go anywhere.
[766.48] A scene has been created in this home,
[768.48] what is the need to go anywhere else
and creating a scene?
[771.48] Shani, you are the limit.
[773.60] It is possible that your friend saw
some other girl and he thought it is Ramsha.
[779.48] My friend…
Enough.
[781.84] That’s it, Shani. That’s it.
[784.00] I don’t want any other scene
created in this home.
[788.36] Had you seen it yourself
it would have been different.
[792.24] Someone else saw it,
[793.16] a friend saw it and you pointed
fingers in your home.
[796.48] Come on, leave.
[797.60] Go to your room. Go.
[818.20] Mehnaz, make Shani understand well that
[821.84] he shouldn’t let his friends interfere
in the matters of my home,
[827.64] or he will see the worst in me.
[838.84] What?
[840.36] What are you staring at me?
[841.92] I didn’t do anything wrong.
[844.08] Come on Annie.
[845.16] I didn’t do anything wrong. Come, Annie.
[862.48] Greetings.
[865.36] How are you brother Tariq?
[868.12] Yes, what?
[870.60] You didn’t get the payment?
[872.72] Really?
[874.68] I will find out.
[877.00] Yes, yes, I will see.
[880.00] May God bless you.
[884.40] Yes. Afnan,
[886.68] I had given the manager
a cheque that he gives it to you.
[890.68] Maybe he forgot.
[893.68] No dad,
[895.24] the manager gave me the cheque,
but I didn’t sign it myself.
[902.12] Why? What is the reason?
[903.40] Why did you not sign?
[907.64] Dad I wanted to talk to you before that.
[910.76] See,
[912.12] you have already done
a lot for the mosque.
[916.68] Things for them to sit on, cooler,
[920.00] you have given them everything of need.
[923.92] But
[925.88] I felt the promise to get an AC installed
in every room is a bit too much.
[934.08] Child, it is really hot.
[936.40] They are young children.
[937.92] If they get this facility,
[940.20] they will be able to focus on
your education much better.
[943.08] Look dad, the one who has
to gain education will do it.
[947.00] And after all, these children
who study in religious schools,
[950.52] maybe they are not in the habit to live in ACs,
[953.28] so maybe it is spoiling their habit.
[958.80] Okay.
[961.96] So your universities also have
ACs installed in them.
[967.76] What do you say?
[969.24] What do you feel that
[971.00] only those who are gaining worldly
knowledge should have this facility?
[975.08] Those who are gaining religious
knowledge, studying in a religious school,
[977.56] they shouldn’t have this facility
of an Air conditioner?
[983.08] Uncle, you know Afnan is right.
[987.44] Look if you want to give money,
do it for something else.
[990.96] This is an added expense.
[993.28] It is a luxury.
[999.52] If it is an additional expense and luxury,
[1001.08] then you people also get
the AC removed from your rooms as well.
[1004.24] Okay?
[1005.52] Because this is an additional expense,
[1007.36] that too will be saved
and luxury won’t remain,
[1009.08] because we cannot install
in AC in every home.
[1010.92] Okay?
[1011.60] Remove the ACs from your rooms.
[1012.92] Uncle.
[1014.52] Dad.
[1015.36] Dad. Dad, please listen to me…
[1018.12] What is wrong with you two?
[1020.24] You have upset brother.
[1022.20] And what was the need for you to interfere?
[1025.88] You know his nature.
[1034.72] Shani,
[1036.80] I saw a confidence on Ramsha’s face.
[1042.36] Look, your friend can have
a misunderstanding,
[1048.44] and if Ramsha was lying for example,
[1052.04] then why would she ask sister in law
to come to her friend’s home?
[1057.80] Bilal cannot have a misunderstanding,
[1060.24] he recognizes her well.
[1062.64] It is possible that your friend knows Ramsha,
[1065.84] but I am sure that you don’t know your friend.
[1070.96] Look Mr. Shani,
[1073.52] some boys have the habit like a woman.
[1077.52] They are in the habit of setting fire
getting into the homes of people
[1081.64] and idiots like you listen to them.
[1085.96] What is wrong with you Anwar?
[1087.64] How much will you scold Shani?
[1089.48] Stop it.
[1090.64] Come on, son,
[1091.24] I have served food. Come on.
[1094.68] I am not hungry.
[1099.56] He is a Nawab!
[1103.04] I don’t know what do you do.
[1111.60] No. No.
[1113.64] There was confidence of the girl’s face,
she is not lying.
[1139.64] What is the problem?
[1150.32] I will call again.
[1152.04] I will keep on calling.
[1158.24] Hello.
[1159.28] Hello Afnan,
[1160.76] where…
When I am disconnecting your call again and again,
[1162.80] then why are you continuously calling me?
[1164.92] A person can be busy,
you should have this much sense.
[1168.00] Now you please don’t call me.
[1169.08] I will call you back myself,
[1170.92] okay?
[1178.16] Afnan. Hello?
[1181.84] He misbehaved so much,
that too with me?
[1187.36] I don’t know what he thinks of himself.
[1196.08] Even if you get free after this,
still don’t call me.
[1198.60] I don’t want to talk to you.
[1208.60] You are the richest
and I am a poor one.
[1214.72] On the Day of Judgment,
[1217.56] all my secrets will be revealed.
[1222.00] In Your sight, I have nothing to hide.
[1227.64] The refuge of Mustafa (Prophet Muhammad)
is my only refuge,
[1231.84] the refuge of Mustafa in solitude,
the refuge of Mustafa in solitude.
[1249.52] Dad, I know you are really upset with me, but….
[1256.44] Dad.
[1259.80] Dad,
[1262.44] what is this?
[1262.80] Why are there tears in your eyes?
[1264.32] No, no,
[1266.84] they are not cause of you.
[1269.88] I know, dad.
[1272.20] I know you got really hurt
because of what we said.
[1274.72] But you misunderstood what I said.
[1277.72] I didn’t mean to say that.
[1281.04] I was just trying to say that whatever
you are doing is too much.
[1291.16] Afnan,
[1293.88] you know when we ask
God for something,
[1298.92] we want that he gives us
the best and the most.
[1307.76] When the time comes to spend in His way,
[1315.16] then we find what we give
and touch a lot.
[1324.56] What do you think?
[1328.20] If you spend out of what
He has given you,
[1330.88] then that will get reduced?
[1333.56] God is not dependent on you,
[1337.24] we are dependent on him.
[1340.96] We desire His blessing.
[1345.08] He is rich.
[1348.84] If He has blessed you
[1353.52] and given you wealth,
[1357.40] and has made you from amongst
those who can given.
[1363.56] If He had made you someone
who would take,
[1365.92] then what could you have done?
[1373.12] We should be thankful to that God,
[1378.56] that He blessed you with wealth.
[1383.84] Spend that wealth in His way
[1388.20] and gather good deeds.
[1393.68] Afnan,
[1397.88] there is a trade of the world,
[1402.84] you get the profit for it here,
[1407.64] in this world.
[1411.56] Try spending in His way,
[1415.68] trade with Him.
[1420.36] You will get the profit for it in this world
and also in the hereafter.
[1425.64] We ask Him in our prayer
[1429.96] “Our Lord, give us in this world
[1434.16] [that which is] good and in the Hereafter
[1437.20] [that which is] good
[1441.00] and protect us from the punishment of the Fire”.
[1449.44] He is really forgiving.
[1461.52] You are absolutely right, dad.
[1466.16] It is my fault.
[1468.96] I am sorry.
[1472.64] Live long.
[1476.92] Live long.
[1483.80] Annie,
[1485.40] I have been looking for you
for so long, you are here.
[1488.32] Annie.
[1490.24] Annie, I am talking to you.
[1492.88] Annie, what is wrong?
Why are you upset?
[1495.72] See, I am already in a bad mood
because of Afnan,
[1498.64] now don’t spoil my mood
further getting upset with me.
[1501.76] You shouldn’t have done this with brother.
[1503.96] You were lying and brother became
the liar in front of the entire home.
[1508.40] Oh,
[1510.04] this is the matter. Huh?
[1511.64] Then tell your brother not
to interfere in my matters.
[1515.24] When his friend told him,
he should have stayed quiet.
[1518.84] He interferes in my matters for
no reason and I say nothing.
[1521.40] He had fun now.
[1524.28] You never call yourself wrong, right?
[1527.36] When I am wrong, I will say it.
[1529.80] Now fix your mood and come with me,
[1531.44] we will make Tik Tok. Come on.
[1532.24] To hell with your TIk Tok and videos.
[1534.76] Mama has said that everyone is at home,
so we will make Biryani.
[1537.68] You make the spices for
the biryani, I will do the rest.
[1540.56] Here we go.
[1541.80] It would have been better that
you had stayed upset with me.
[1544.32] I am not going to make any biryani.
[1546.16] You know, other people go
for an outing on off days.
[1550.24] They have food at good restaurants.
[1551.96] And then there is our home.
[1553.04] Cook biryani, cook curry,
increase your work.
[1556.00] I am not doing any work.
[1559.00] Fine. Fine. Fine.
[1561.40] Do one thing.
[1562.92] I will make the biryani,
[1564.12] but then you will wash
the remaining dishes
[1565.88] and you will also make the tea.
[1569.36] I will wash the dishes?
[1571.56] Poor thing.
[1574.08] I won’t do any work.
[1619.92] Even if you get free after this,
still don’t call me.
[1622.64] I don’t want to talk to you.
[1627.08] Idiot.
[1636.56] Are you thinking about me?
[1639.88] Yes, obviously.
[1642.28] Who else do I have in my life
apart from you?
[1645.72] You are the reason of my life.
[1648.96] Okay tell me,
[1650.60] why did you not go to the office today?
[1652.60] Mr. Afnan,
[1654.36] what thoughts are you lost in?
[1656.28] What is the day today?
[1658.52] I don’t know.
[1659.96] It is a Sunday.
[1661.72] Oh.
[1664.28] Okay get up, get fresh.
[1665.60] Mama is waiting for you
over breakfast.
[1667.20] She has prepared breakfast for you, herself.
[1669.44] For me?
[1670.16] Yes.
[1670.64] Very good.
[1672.24] It has been so long that
I have had breakfast aunt made.
[1674.80] Did she make fried flat bread?
[1675.72] Yes, your favourite.
[1676.72] Okay great,
[1677.36] you go ahead. I will get fresh and come.
[1690.08] I will quickly call Afnan,
[1691.92] before someone comes.
[1702.12] What is it, Afnan?
[1703.36] You never answer my phone.
[1711.72] He is really weird.
[1718.56] They make me do all the work.
[1720.32] I cannot do this work.
[1726.44] How do I…
[1728.96] Where are mama and Annie?
[1734.00] You scared me.
[1735.92] I don’t know,
[1736.88] it is the 40th day of mourning of
sister Anum’s mother in law, they went there.
[1741.56] Okay.
[1745.56] You were not there in
the restaurant, right?
[1749.48] You go and ask that friend
of yours this, who you believed.
[1754.88] Yes.
[1757.52] Yes,
[1758.76] I feel he had a misunderstanding
[1761.36] and I apologize, I should have asked you first.
[1765.64] Look Shani, what had to happen,
has happened.
[1768.12] Now leave from here
and don’t bother me.
[1772.64] Why are you so annoyed of me?
[1776.12] Yes, so you too talk to me
like you are annoyed.
[1778.68] It feels like you are
an old enemy of mine,
[1781.32] and now see,
[1782.56] you are being so innocent,
and talking to me so politely,
[1785.40] as if you really like me?
[1802.68] Hey.
[1804.96] Did you come to your senses or should
[1805.96] I dry all the clothes on your face?
[1808.64] Hey, talk to me with a bit of love
and affection for once.
[1813.32] Are your actions such that
I talk to you with love and affection?
[1817.08] Talk with love.
[1821.52] Go from here, now.
[1824.04] You are standing on my head.
[1828.24] I will leave. I will. I am going.
[1845.80] Hey Afnan, what are you doing?
[1846.96] Leave it. This is my work.
[1848.32] I will do it.
[1849.32] In fact, we have so many servants
at home to work.
[1852.08] Hey aunt, so what if
I help you for a change.
[1855.24] What book in the world states that
[1856.36] no man in the home cannot come in
the kitchen and do any work?
[1859.20] I will help my aunt.
[1860.72] In fact, today I will feed you
a new recipe made by me.
[1865.56] Mama.
[1868.16] What is going on?
[1870.28] This is what you should actually do,
[1872.72] but because you are really busy,
[1874.88] I thought I would help my aunt.
[1877.20] By the way, what are you doing here,
[1878.48] you have nothing to do here.
[1880.80] What are you cooking?
[1881.88] Me?
[1882.80] I was helping my beloved aunt…
[1889.12] You have helped out so well,
it is scattered everywhere.
[1891.96] I am so sorry aunt.
[1893.36] Aunt, save your feet.
[1894.64] You might cut yourself with the glass.
[1895.96] I will just clean the entire place.
[1897.68] I will clean it all.
[1898.24] All this happened cause of you.
You came…
[1900.48] Because of me?
[1901.36] Yes, you shouldn’t have come here.
[1902.28] Hey, don’t fight…
You have caused this destruction.
[1905.68] Afnan, sir, you were getting
a call from someone on your phone,
[1907.96] I took off the phone from
charging and brought it.
[1911.88] Who is calling you?
[1912.92] Who is so restless to talk to you?
[1916.08] Hey, I am a client in my business.
[1919.04] Client?
[1920.04] Yes, yes, he has been after me
for a long time.
[1922.04] He wants to invest.
[1923.28] He has bothered me.
I will talk to him and come.
[1925.12] I will talk…
[1926.16] You go inside, I am coming.
[1927.56] Tabassum come here,
a glass broke, pick it up.
[1929.52] He just came to cook food.
[1931.88] Alizay,
[1933.84] now you too learn to cook something.
[1935.60] You know how much he enjoys eating.
[1939.12] Fine, I will see.
[1940.24] See, this glass is broken, pick it up.
[1953.52] The biryani is really delicious.
[1957.60] Who is it?
[1959.00] He has bothered me…
[1962.32] Ramsha,
[1963.80] switch off your phone at
the time of food.
[1965.64] Switch it off.
[1968.16] Yes, mama, I have kept it.
[1990.12] That’s it.
[1991.24] What happened?
[1993.84] I am done eating.
[1995.56] You ate so soon?
You had just started eating.
[1997.84] You were the one insisting that
food should be served.
[2000.32] Sit and eat properly.
[2001.72] Papa, I ate well, my stomach is full.
[2004.56] That’s it, I cannot eat more.
[2007.48] See, that’s why her health is like this.
[2009.84] When does she eat?
She pecks on it like a bird.
[2012.56] Sister in law, I would say
snatch her mobile from her.
[2015.80] She doesn’t pay attention to her nutrition
[2017.56] because of this phone all the time.
[2019.20] Even right now a friend must have called her.
[2021.32] Because of this, see,
she left her food and went.
[2023.32] Yes, Salma, you are absolutely right.
[2025.28] This mobile is a torment.
[2027.88] It is a torment.
[2030.84] Hey, have this.
[2045.88] Alizay,
[2047.48] are you going somewhere?
[2048.72] Yes, mama,
[2049.32] I am going for dinner with Afnan.
[2051.28] Will you come along?
[2052.64] No, no, you people go.
[2054.08] Enjoy.
[2055.32] After all, you people
look really good together.
[2059.36] I was thinking Alizay,
that I talk to brother.
[2062.60] About what?
[2064.12] About your engagement with Afnan.
[2067.20] I think you two should get engaged now.
[2070.00] Yes,
[2071.20] mama,
[2073.36] you know, I just joined my new job,
[2078.20] so I am a little busy right now.
[2079.52] Give me some time.
[2083.36] I talked about the engagement,
not marriage.
[2085.68] Don’t talk to me like this for no reason.
[2087.72] mama, what is the hurry you are in?
[2090.60] Afnan and I live in the same home,
[2092.76] and I am not running away.
[2095.08] I am just asking you for some time.
[2097.28] I want that first I become strong,
I make my career.
[2100.80] And I am sure you go
and talk to uncle about the engagement.
[2104.36] He will get after me from
the next day to start the preparation.
[2107.20] I will have to do all
the preparation, clothing, shopping.
[2111.04] So mama, please don’t
talk about anything right now.
[2114.88] It is useless to talk to you.
[2131.92] Alizay, are you ready?
[2134.44] Just give me two minutes.
[2135.80] Hey Alizay, what is wrong?
[2138.08] I mean, we are going for dinner,
[2139.64] not for our honeymoon,
that you are getting ready so much.
[2142.04] I too know that we are not
going for our honeymoon
[2144.04] and we are going for dinner.
[2145.24] You will see the preparation for
the honeymoon separately.
[2147.64] You will see after marriage.
[2149.12] Really?
[2150.92] What preparation will you make?
[2153.48] Should I tell you everything right now?
[2154.56] Yes, tell me.
[2156.32] By the way, what have you thought?
[2159.20] Are we not getting late now?
[2161.04] Yes, yes, come on. Come.
[2161.84] Come on.
