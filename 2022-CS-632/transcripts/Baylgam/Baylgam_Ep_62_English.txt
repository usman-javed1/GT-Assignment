Doctor, is Ramsha fine? Thank God, both the mother 
and child are safe. Thank God. Can I meet her? No. Not right now. She is under 
observation right now you meet her in a while. Thank you God. You were getting angry at me for no reason.
Shut up. You didn’t leave any stone unturned to 
hit your foot with an axe, Shani. Thank God, it is Ramsha’s habit that 
she recites prayers before leaving home. God kept her and the child safe. I am just coming. Hey, dad, what happened? Greetings. Ramsha fell from the motorbike, 
she is not fine. What? Ramsha fell from the motorbike? How?
Is she fine? Did she get hurt? I didn’t ask for details, 
we have to go to her home. Yes, so what hospital is she in?
Let’s go immediately. No, not the hospital,
we have to go home. Let’s go quickly. I am worried. 
Come on. You come with me. If I don’t go home, 
then Afnan will surely wait for me. He will call me and find out where I am. I have also decided, 
I too will not answer his call. After all, he should care for me too. When I don’t go home, 
then he will worry for me. Why should I always worry myself 
for him. He too should suffer. You don’t worry at all, 
I am absolutely fine. Don’t worry. God has been kind or else the way Ramsha fell 
from the motorcycle and fainted, I got really worried. Mr. Qasim, what can we do? How can we trust a two wheeler? And the doctor has strictly advised 
Rimsha from traveling on the bike, but what can we do? 
We are helpless. You know I really want 
to buy a car for Ramsha. I even thought about it 
once or twice, but things didn’t work out. For now, I only have this bike. We will have to put ourselves 
in danger. I had given charity for Ramsha. God has saved us from such 
a big problem, after all. Thank God. Now you people be careful, you people be careful 
and take care. And Ramsha, child, you have to
 take care of yourself. Follow the instructions 
from the doctor. Okay? Yes, uncle. Tea… I will bring it. 
No child, you sit, I will bring it. You know, Mr. Qasim, 
if you ask me honestly, then I am really happy 
that you came. You visited after a long time. Yes, I really miss Ramsha and 
I want to come, but… You must have thought what would 
you do visiting us poor people. No, no, nothing like that, 
we are all equal. What is poverty and richness, a Muslim is a well-wisher 
of each other. If someone is blessed, 
it is only to test them. You have said something great. Absolutely. Shani, son, take care of Ramsha. A husband and wife stands like this 
with each other in troubles and difficulties. Yes. Meet me in my office 
in the morning tomorrow, but don’t tell anyone here, please. Is Mr. Afnan back? Where were you? I… Ramsha was unwell, I went to 
her home to ask how she is. What was the need for you to go 
to Ramsha’s home? If uncle had to go, he could 
have gone with the driver. Look, I am really tired. There was a lot of work in the office, 
then we went to Ramsha’s home, now I cannot argue about this 
after coming home. Yes, so that’s what I am saying, what was the need for you to go 
to Ramsha’s home directly from the office, to console her? I had requested you, but you as usual are not 
listening to me. I have moved on. I don’t understand what I should do. Brother, you please make 
Afnan understand. Making Afnan understand is not 
the solution to the problem, Afsheen. And what do you think I have not 
spoken to Afnan? I didn’t mean that, brother, I am just saying that those two are 
always fighting at home. You see, there are servants 
at home too, what would they think 
when they see it. Things have progressed further
 than this, Afsheen. You told me yourself, he said something so strict 
in your presence. I am afraid that Afnan might say 
something wrong in his anger or naivety, do you understand how delicate 
this relation is. Look Afsheen, you make 
Alizeh understand, tell her to bring a positive change 
in her behaviour. Look, her needs are being met 
from every end. She does what she wants. Afnan 
doesn’t put any restrictions on her. Although, I myself don’t like 
a few things Alizeh says, I don’t agree to them. 
But still… still… Afnan is not saying anything to her, 
and she has complaints from Afnan. I think Afnan is as fault. He didn’t keep his position 
respectable as a husband. You need a leader for the journey, 
and this is the journey of life. You need balance, 
and that is not happening. All this is happening because of it. The whole home is disturbed 
because of the behaviour of these two. All of us are disturbed. You know, Mr. Afnan, you are really concerned 
for Ramsha, my wife. You know, if my wife asks me for such 
a big sum of money, then I will think ten times. And then there is you, you wrote me a cheque in ten minutes. 
Amazing. Just shut up. I know you don’t understand my jokes. But it is fine. I will go now, goodbye. Now you won’t bother Ramsha at all. No, not at all. Any other order? Look Shani, try and understand me. Ramsha is your wife, clean your heart towards Ramsha. She is your wife, she loves you. and you… you too take a lot of care of her. Someone can only care 
so much for their own. I just want to see Ramsha happy. I want that she stays happy with you. She is your wife. I want that you fulfill her rights. Bring peace in her life. That girl has seen a lot of pain. As far as love is concerned, I don’t love her. I hope you understand this. yes, come in. Greetings. Greetings. You are still awake?
 All okay. Were you busy? No. No. Tell me, what happened? 
You look worried. I am tired, dad. I didn’t know that life would 
look away from me like this. The peace in my life is lost. It feels it will never come back. I am unable to focus on work either. I am really worried, dad. Patience and worship are two 
strengths of the believer. Offer prayers, have patience. God will make better decisions. I am not able to be patient. It feels like the courage to be 
patient has ended. What would you know what the courage of patience is. 
Anyway, what do you want? What do I want? Me wanting or not wanting doesn’t 
matter anymore dad. I made a big mistake. The first mistake was rejecting Ramsha’s love. The second mistake of 
accepting Alizeh. Now it feels like that both these mistakes are such that
 they cannot be redeemed. When you feel that 
they are irredeemable, then there is no point of talking
 about it. Dad, Alizeh cannot make 
that place in my heart, that Ramsha has…
Stop. Afnan. The one you are talking 
about is someone’s wife. And it doesn’t suit a man to talk like this about someone’s wife. Control yourself. I have no control on my heart, dad.
You have control on your tongue, right? Control your tongue. Don’t be hasty making a decision. Let the decision come to you. His decision, the One who makes the best decision. And yes, after today, I shouldn’t hear you mention 
Ramsha like this. Go and sleep. Alizeh must be waiting for you. Tea. Keep it. Where is Shani? He will come. Greetings. Greetings. Where were you? Huh? And did the work I tell you 
to do get done or not? And tell me, why are you not answering my phone? I had gone to do something important. How many times have I told you 
that do all your important work after closing the shop. Now I cannot manage the shop alone, 
I get tired. I went to the travel agent. 
Huh? Had I gone after closing the shop, 
he would have closed down. Travel agent? Why? I am thinking of going to Dubai. My friend Waseem, he has found a job for me, he says if I come, 
he will get me on it. What? You are going to Dubai and you didn’t even tell me. Mama, you had told me yourself that when you are doing something, 
then don’t make too much noise, it catches the evil eye. So I thought I would let you people 
know when it is done. Wow, that’s great. I had told you to hide it from strangers, 
I didn’t tell you not even tell your parents. Look, listen to me. Listen to something, this friend Waseem of yours is showing
you a rosy picture. Going to Dubai is not that easy. It costs this much money, 
this much money. Where will we get 
so much money from? You don’t worry about the money,
that arrangement has been made. Where did you do it from? Speak up. 
Speak up, where did you arrange it from? Papa, I will tell you 
when the time comes. Mama, I am hungry, serve food, I am coming. Anwer, you keep a check on Shani, what if he does something wrong. Make him understand. What is this deal of the money? I will make him understand once 
I get my hands on him. All day long, he goes around 
with his cheap friends. And since the day, this damned 
Waseem came from Dubai, that’s it, he goes around him. He will go to Dubai. I too will see if he goes to Dubai. Yes, brother, 
you are absolutely right. I think you have thought 
the right thing for these people. I think this will be better 
for these people. Greetings. Greetings. Yes, uncle you called? Yes, child, I wanted to talk about 
something important. We were thinking that you and Afnan take a break 
from your office, take an off, go travel. When you spend time 
with each other, then these frictions, these 
misunderstandings will be removed. Sorry, it is not possible for me. After all, the office people won’t 
give me such a long leave. Fine, then resign. I won’t resign. Look Alizeh, we are not stopping you from 
your professional life, you do it. But when you come back, 
you join the office with Afnan. Look, his work is increasing 
he needs assistance, he needs a partner, if you work it will be good. 
What do you think? Brother, that is such a good advice. This way, both of them will get 
a chance to spend time together. what is wrong with you? I will not do anything like that. The person who is tolerating me 
at home with so much difficulty, how will he tolerate me in the office? What do you want? Today we are fighting at home today,
tomorrow this drama reaches the office? And maybe you are forgetting the strict words Afnan used. Alizeh, listen to me and 
try to understand. Please uncle, stop it. This is all your doing. You had brought Ramsha 
to this home. Alizeh, how are you talking to brother? I am right, mama. I feel at times uncle knew everything. Uncle, you knew it, right? Alizeh, be quiet. Why should I be quiet? He knew everything about Afnan 
and Ramsha. He brought Ramsha to this home 
on purpose so that she gets closer to Afnan. Right, uncle? 
Am I speaking the truth? Why did you do this? Today, you are responsible 
for my life being ruined. You are the most responsible for it. Alizeh!
Afsheen… Have some shame. Hey, I don’t understand anything 
about this boy, Shani. Ramsha, whatever he gets in his head, he only rests when he does it. 
Now tell me, how do I give him permission to go 
so far? You are in this condition, you need him. Is Shani going somewhere? Yes, why? Did he not tell you? No, he didn’t tell me anything. Where is he going? Hey, he wants to go to Dubai, he was saying I will go there 
and earn money. He went to get his passport 
made today. I don’t understand from where 
he got so much money? He doesn’t even have such a friend who would give him so much money, they are all useless and selfish. But going to Dubai costs a lot, where did he get so much money from? Yes, that’s what I am thinking. Where did he get so much money from?
Where did he arrange it from? He doesn’t tell me anything either. At least, if he stays at home, 
sits with me, then I will ask him. I don’t understand how 
he got so much money from. God forbid he is doing 
something wrong. Afsheen, why did you raise 
your hand at Alizeh? You shouldn’t have done this. What else could I do, brother? Did you not see how much 
she was misbehaving with you. Till today, I have even spoken loudly 
in front of you. You have done us a lot of favours
 brother. I am surprised that Alizeh didn’t think a little 
before speaking. She embarrassed me in front of you. Why do you think this way, Afsheen? I didn’t do any favour on you, Afsheen. I just fulfilled the responsibility of 
an elder brother, that’s it. You and Alizeh are really dear to me, you are part of my family. But you shouldn’t have raised 
your hand on her. Okay, you do one thing, you go…
go and talk to her. Talk to her calmly, 
make her understand. Come on, go. Shani, are you going to Dubai?
Yes. You didn’t even tell me, Shani. Now will I have to do everything 
seeking your permission? Not seeking permission, 
but at least, I am your wife, you can tell me, 
right? Yes, and that is my problem. This is why I have to tolerate you, 
or else… You have no feelings in you, 
right, Shani? You are leaving me in this condition 
and going to Dubai? Yes, I am going. And no need to create a scene
when I am going, because I will not stay. The day I get my visa, I will leave the very next day, 
do you understand? If not me, then at least care 
for your child. I know well what I have to do 
and what I don’t have to do. I will see it myself. You are a really selfish man. Fine, do what you want. I will not say anything. When you have no feelings then 
why should I cry in front of you. Yes, fine, then have a strong heart. Where did you get 
so much money from? I took It from you? No, right? So mind your own business. So that’s what I am asking 
who you took the money from? Look, don’t drive me mad. This is the reason, 
I don’t come home. Mama, can I ask you something? Go ahead, child. Will you tell me honestly? Have I ever lied to you before that
I will lie now? Ask me. Am I your real child, 
or stepdaughter? I know you are upset with me. But child, also understand my helplessness. Slapping me was your helplessness? Look, it was necessary for me 
to raise my hand at you. Had I not raised my hand, then brother has been 
misled about you, he would also have been 
misled about me. Had I not raised my hand, then brother’s heart would have 
become harder. Now I have put the embarrassment 
and disappoint in our share on brother. Brother must be feeling guilty. I am telling you he must be guilty. You tell me yourself, have I ever raised my hand 
at you before today? Child, you have no idea 
how far am I planning for. What do you mean?
