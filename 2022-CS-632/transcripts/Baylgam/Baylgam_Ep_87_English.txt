Yes, absolutely fine 
by the grace of God. Umm Yes Mr Balaj, do one thing deliver the car to the same address that I have sent you. Yes, I will also send 
you the pin location but it shouldn’t go to 
any wrong address. Thank you so much. Thanks. Congratulations Miss, your new car is coming tomorrow, I have ordered a car for you. What? Car for me? Why? You will need the car, you will have to go to places, or what if you need 
something for the house, so you must have a car. In fact, I have also arranged a driver, the car along with the driver ... ...will stay in the parking lot at all times. Thank You Afnan you thought
 so much for me. Thank you so much. So then do one, thing teach me how to drive as well. Driving to you? So it would be good Afnan, if there is any emergency or if I have to come to you, or if I have any work, I should know how to drive as well. Teach me please. That is absolutely right too. Good, that’s great. But just know that I will put my life in danger and
 teach you how to drive, it’s your responsibility
 to protect my life now. Driving a car is very easy, first of all, fasten your seatbelt. Where is it? It’s on the side there. Okay, yes. Slowly, slowly, the seatbelt won’t come all the way down, it will be hooked there. You have to fasten it in this knob here. Wait a minute, my drape. Wait for a minute. Yes, okay. Here? here. Just put it in the 
knob in here. Afnan, don’t get angry, now look if you do this 
how would I drive? Umm, Set the back mirror. Good girl. Good Student Ramsha, Yes? The back mirror is not for you
 to see your drape but the car coming from behind. It’s for safety purposes. Set it. Do it, can you see? No, yes, now I do. Good, two things are done now, place your feet on the brake. Which one? Right or left? Left. Okay then? Put it, and this is.. Should I move it away? No, no, don’t move it 
away right now, this is a push start, the car will start from this, here it is done. Now while your foot is 
placed on the brake, bring it drive. Should I move my foot away? On the brake... foot, foot, foot, while the foot is 
still pressing the brake. By placing my feet and then? 1 2 3 okay? Okay. Now put very light pressure 
of your foot and press the accelerator and
 then leave the brake. And then immediately move 
my foot away from the brake? Not immediately, 
not immediately, not immediately, make it straight, make it straight. I am doing it Afnan, there is also a car in front 
I also have to see it. Yes, be careful. Careful, careful, very careful.. Umm yes, yes, but I feel your speed is a little high, It’s fine. It’s high, high, slow slow, slow down, 
slow down, look, listen to me, don’t look at me, look in front, dude, 
what are you… Dude, I will obviously look 
at you if you will talk. Okay sorry that I asked you 
to listen to me carefully, but listen to me and look
 at road and focus. Afnan, you are confusing me a lot, I cannot drive like this. Okay, Sorry, I will do one thing, I will wear the seat belt. Afnan nothing will happen, don’t scare me so much now, Hey, look, watch in front and drive. Yes, I am watching. Look in front, look in front, good girl, turn towards the left here, turn towards the left here, Okay, okay, wait a minute, I also have to look behind. to the left, to the left! I am sorry. Sorry brother, sorry. Do one thing, get out of the car. Afnan. You get off, I will, I will drive myself. 
You just get off, enough driving for today. Is that how someone drives a car? I mean you would have just 
killed yourself and me too. You are laughing? Why are you being so scared? So weren’t you scared? Why should I be scared 
when you are with me. Do you know when you are with me, I am not scared of anything, I feel I am the safest in the world. And when you are with me, my life changes. I know I get angry over everything but it is just related to the 
bitterness of my life, which gradually made me this way. But when you are with me, I start to see colors, I start liking people, I feel like I am living, I am living my life to the fullest. And I promise you I will always be with you, I will never leave you alone, Are you sure? Now don’t take advantage 
of all this and drive, get off the car, sit here 
I will drive. No, I will drive a bit more. Let’s go. Let’s go. 1 2 3 hey, what are you doing? Just because of you 
draping your head, I will get the cloth on my face, 
I will die. Afnan, don’t say that again. okay I won’t. Shall we go? Let’s go. Ramsha. Ramsha, I talk to you with 
love again and again and you start driving fast. Ramsha, Ramsha, please, Ramsha? Okay, okay, okay, Okay Afnan. Thank you, Ramsha. Listen, you haven’t called Alizeh even for
 once since you have come here, why? Even Alizeh didn’t call me, she doesn’t care about me at all. Where am I, how am I, she doesn’t want to know. Don’t say like that, Afnan, she is your wife. And no matter how 
busy a wife is, they are always concerned 
about their husband. What has happened to you? You are talking like 
you don’t know that I have no importance
 in Alizeh’s life. Okay, forget all this, call her. She will like it if you call her. And what about you? I wouldn’t mind at all. Call her, I will be right back. Hey, why don’t you quit job? You are always tired because of it. Afnan, please, I don’t even have the energy
 to argue with you right now. Okay fine, okay fine, 
don’t argue but at least you can take 
a few days off before engagement. But why? Who takes an off for engagement? What do you even say? And I am very tired today, we will just go tomorrow. Afnan, I told you that even my manager is on leaves, I cannot take an off at this time. Okay great, call at the office and inform there is an emergency at home, if manager can take an off then you can too. Afnan, by the way, 
why are you so worried? The doctor was just telling 
you Uncle is better now, let him rest, there are other people 
at home too, servants are here too, so please don’t worry. That means you will definitely
 go to the office. Why are you being worried like Uncle has been unwell for ages? I am not worried about
 Dad’s health as much as I hurt due 
to your behavior. Please Afnan, stop talking nonsense, I was concerned for him 
that is why I came early. Yes, I can clearly see how much you were concerned for him. Afnan, actually there are some people, no matter how much you do for
 them they never get happy, you are one of them. Afnan, you haven’t been giving me 
time since Uncle has been hospitalized. You are so feelingless, my dad is fighting the battle of life 
and death there at the hospital and you just care about 
yourself here. Afnan, I guess you 
are forgetting that Uncle is at the hospital
 because of your most beloved, so if you are being so angry, go tell this to Ramsha, not me. I don’t understand that even after so much has happened, you are still letting her 
live in this house, in fact, how will you get 
her out of the house when you couldn’t take her 
out of your heart yet? Okay, forget all this, call her. She will like it if you call her. Hello? Thank God, that you cared 
about calling me as well. What if I make the same 
complaint to you? How can you make the same 
complaint to me, Afnan? This is your responsibility to call 
me when you reach there but you didn’t even inform me. Alizeh, why do you 
always blame me? Because it is always
 your mistake, Afnan. Do you even realize? In fact, why would you? You never realize. I have been waiting for 
your call for so long but you are so careless that it doesn’t make any difference to you. If it wouldn’t make any difference to me, I wouldn’t have called you. So then why did you call me? You have called me to brag that 
you are doing me a favor? Afnan, please, learn to accept your mistake. If it was me at your place, you would have expected me to inform you when 
I reached somewhere and if I didn’t you would have been 
saying 10 things to me. What are you doing, Alizeh? If you think I am saying 
something wrong, so then I will hang up,
 you stay happy. Alizeh? The thing is that I have made a plan today and the plan is that I will do
 your make up today. What? Yes. How will you do my make up? How will I not? When I can teach you how to drive, so you can teach me how 
to do make up. I will do it. What is this? Okay, so it means, if you can teach me how
 to drive your car, so I will have to teach 
you to do make-up. You are taking revenge? What’s revenge in it? I want to do your makeover
 with my own hands. Let’s do one thing, let’s put 
nail paint on you. That is fine. I can’t apply nail paint, I have to offer prayers. Is it Alizeh’s call? You attend it, I will be right back. Ramsha? Hello I thought you will call me 
back to convince me but you didn’t even call me back. I got a bit busy. You have changed a lot Afnan. Anyway, is your work done that 
you went there for? Yes, almost done, just a little bit is left. Hmm. How is the weather in Islamabad? Yes, it’s nice, it’s fine. Tell me why didn’t Aunt call me? She usually calls me. Yes, Mom is not well that is why she must have not called. Okay, what happened to her? I will do one thing, I will call and ask her. Yes do it. Afnan, will you have tea? Afnan, whose voice was this? Where are you? What is wrong with you, Alizeh? I am in a restaurant. My colleagues are with me, one of my colleagues 
has asked me for tea. Okay listen, the meeting is about to start
 I will call you back, bye. Hel… What was this? What was this? I am sorry Afnan, I had no idea you were
 talking to Alizeh. What sorry, dude? Don’t you know I was 
talking to Alizeh on call? No, how would I know you would be on call, I felt you had hung up. How can you feel that? I received her call in front of you, 
I was talking. You have no idea I will get into such a big problem and trouble because of you. I think you don’t want me 
to come to meet you. I am sorry Ramsha. You know it very well I will never cause you any pain in purpose, and I don’t want you to get into 
any trouble because of me. I know that. You know but you still hurt me. I am sorry, I got angry all of a sudden, but you are right that it doesn’t suit me
 I shouldn’t shout at you, that is why, I am sorry. It’s okay I forgive you. Ramsha, I am saying I realize my mistake, I know you have been 
hurt because of me. It is your job to hurt me, it's nothing new. Really? I haven’t hurt you or made
 you cry after marriage. You have begun to. Did you start? I won't now. Will you forgive me or should
 I become a rooster? Or hold my ears? Okay sorry. Enough, enough I forgive you. Thank you You will not get angry at me again. Never. I am telling you. Greetings, mom. Greetings Alizeh, Alizeh, Has Afnan 
come back to Karachi? No Afnan is in Islamabad. But I just saw him in 
the shopping mall. In the shopping mall? But I don’t understand where he disappeared 
all of a sudden. No mom, you must be having
 some misunderstanding, Afnan is in Islamabad he is coming back tomorrow, I just spoke to him. Alizeh, my eyes cannot
 be betrayed. I am telling you it was Afnan. Do one thing, call Afnan right now and ask him if he is in Islamabad or Karachi but I am sure he has 
come back to Karachi. Really? I will check, okay. Afnan, you didn’t tell me that you are going to Islamabad 
like this all of a sudden? You didn’t even tell me that you have a meeting and you are going for 2 3 days. Hey, the meeting was 
scheduled a long time ago I forgot to tell you. And the Islamabad office has been
 ignored for a long time as well, I thought of giving
 two days there, Hello? Afnan, have you come 
back to Karachi? Umm, why what happened? Where are you, Alizeh? Where would I be? I am at home. Mom called me she was saying she saw you at the shopping mall. That is why I am asking you if have you come to Karachi. Hello? Af.. Afnan, can you hear me? Yes I can, I am listening. So answer me where are you? Hey Alizeh, I am in
 Islamabad only, I told you that tomorrow, I have to come back tomorrow. Yes, but I think she has had some 
huge misunderstanding, she must have seen 
someone else. I was sitting in a very 
important meeting in Islamabad, and just came out to get your
 call when you called me. Okay listen they are calling me 
again and again in the meeting, it doesn’t look nice. So, I will go back, 
I will talk to you later. Okay, okay bye. Stop testing my patience, you have lied enough, how much more will you lie? I have seen you with that
 girl with my own eyes, who was that girl, Afnan? Afnan, who was that girl? Alizeh, listen to me… How can you do this to me? Alizeh, Alizeh, you listen to me. What are you trying to say? Say it. Okay, I will only answer
 if you let me speak. I… Alizeh, you are getting it wrong, it’s not what you think. I just don’t want to talk to you, move. Alizeh, please I am saying, trust me, what happened? I trusted you the most, and what did you do? You broke my trust, I am so disappointed 
with you Afnan. Alizeh, listen to me? Alizeh, listen to me, what is wrong? At least listen to me. What is your problem Afnan? I told you don’t talk to me. okay then do one think, let’s think, I will think to, because if you do this, then, I will marry someone else. Okay, so go, and marry someone else 
as much as you want to. I don’t care. You do care. I know it very well you are angry that is why 
you are saying that else you love me a lot for real. You wish. I hate you. Ramsha? Ramsha? Yes? What are you doing in the kitchen? Afnan, Abida called she is not coming today so I have to do all 
the work myself. Okay that’s great, let’s do one, let’s order food from outside today. No we won’t order anything
 from outside, I know you don’t like eating 
from outside at all so I am cooking myself. Hey, but I also don’t lie you
 working in the kitchen. I can eat from outside for
 you for one day at least. No, you like pulao and kebabs, that is why I am making them, you will leave tomorrow anyway, then I have to eat alone. That is why I am saying this, let’s spend whatever 
time is left together. Please come sit with me, I want to make every 
moment special. Okay let me turn this off. Quickly, quickly, come quickly. Yes? Sit here. Right in front of me, yes close your eyes. Why? Close your eyes. Okay. Can I open them? No, you have to keep 
your eyes closed. What are you doing? May I open them now? No. What are you doing Afnan? May I open my eyes, what? Open them now. How did you like it? What was the need for it, Afnan? Why wasn’t it needed? Your mood got so off 
because of me today, I thought I should get you a gift
 to make it up to you. Yes but you apologized and I even forgave you, then why this? But apologizing wasn’t enough. I had to make it up for the tears 
that came in your eyes.
