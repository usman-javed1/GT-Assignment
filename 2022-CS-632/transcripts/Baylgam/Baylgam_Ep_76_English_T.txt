[22.16] Brother, fine,
[24.08] you supported Ramsha out of
sympathy earlier as well.
[27.56] You kept her in this home, but
[29.92] now it is not reasonable.
[33.72] What do you want to say, Afsheen?
[36.52] Brother, Afnan and Alizay’s life will
be disturbed cause of Ramsha.
[49.16] And right now,
[51.44] Alizay and Afnan’s happiness
should matter for us.
[61.64] I admit that Ramsha is
really worried, but
[66.12] this can surely not be
the solution for this.
[74.68] Oh God,
[79.12] even you were worried, Afsheen.
[89.96] I supported you.
[92.44] I kept you in this home,
[93.32] I didn’t let you lack anything.
[95.96] Do you remember?
[99.96] Brother, I am your sister.
[104.28] Ramsha is my daughter.
[106.08] The relation made in words
have no importance.
[108.24] It has importance for me.
[117.12] When I was unwell, then
[119.92] who cared for me day
and night? Huh?
[128.12] Who was it who didn’t care
about day and night?
[130.08] It is in front of you.
[131.64] Ramsha stayed up all night.
[139.60] She and I had no relation,
[141.92] but we had a relation of care.
[154.00] Afsheen, relations are
made through care.
[165.32] And the blood relations that have
no care in them are meaningless.
[175.28] Meaning,
[175.96] you think that when that
child needs me,
[180.12] then I send her to a hostel?
[187.88] No,
[189.84] that will not happen.
[194.52] Why do we have such
a big home for?
[198.76] She will stay here.
[208.16] Anyway, there are no other
opinions in this matter.
[276.76] I had no idea all this
would happen with me.
[286.64] I have been cheated so badly.
[290.76] He trapped me in the
name of business
[295.40] and he took all the money from me.
[304.64] I sat there hungry for three days,
[307.00] I had nothing to eat or drink.
[314.96] Thank God I came to Pakistan,
[317.80] so I got saved.
[320.60] That’s why I had told you not to!
[323.96] Don’t go so far.
[326.84] Don’t leave.
[332.80] You ruined all the money,
[334.96] did your heart find peace?
[337.72] Papa, I didn’t know
[338.96] Waseem would do this with me.
[347.56] He looked away from
me going there.
[351.44] Shani, I always used to
make you understand
[358.56] that all your friends are
useless and opportunists,
[361.72] they will cheat you.
[367.36] But you didn’t listen to me at all.
[369.88] This is the limit, papa.
[371.32] I had thought that you
would support me,
[373.04] you would sympathize with me,
[374.16] but you are insulting me.
[375.28] Lower your voice.
[378.68] You chose this path of
destruction for yourself.
[381.96] It is no one else’s fault, Shani.
[384.12] It is all your fault.
[385.88] What is wrong?
[387.04] What argument are you people getting into?
[388.68] What had to happen, has happened.
[390.08] Now don’t blame each other.
[393.68] I had thought I would come to my home,
[397.20] then maybe the family would support me,
[399.40] they would listen to me.
[402.40] I will start everything fresh.
[407.88] But here,
[409.20] they are only insulting me.
[412.04] When you have empty pockets,
[414.92] then no reassurance is of any use.
[417.96] All reassurances given to an
empty hand are useless.
[422.88] Whatever money we had,
you ruined it all.
[425.84] Here the shop is also empty
[429.88] and on top of that Mr. Qasim has
stopped all him support packages.
[436.04] Remember Shani,
[438.92] you didn’t just divorce Ramsha,
[441.60] along with her,
you have ruined all of us.
[446.64] If Ramsha was with us today,
[449.76] then Mr. Qasim would have
supported us in this difficult time,
[453.20] he would have done something.
[456.32] But you got your hands
and feet cut as well,
[459.68] but you also made us
handicapped with you.
[463.36] We are handicapped.
[468.40] He will start fresh!
[475.20] Shani. Shani.
[493.80] Did your bike break down or
[495.08] mister didn’t realize spending
time with loafers,
[499.36] how late he has become.
[500.72] You had to open the shop.
[502.84] I came and opened the shop.
[504.28] All of them were standing outside.
[505.96] When will you realize
your responsibilities?
[511.64] I went to Waseem on the way.
[516.36] My visa for Dubai is here,
I am leaving tomorrow.
[520.52] What?
[522.80] So soon?
[528.68] Yes, papa, so soon.
[531.00] After all, I was tired of
hearing your taunts.
[535.28] It is good,
[536.80] now you take care of
your business yourself.
[539.84] I am going home to pack my bags.
[569.28] So she is responsible for it, Afnan.
[571.76] If she got married to Shani,
[573.56] then she should have compromised
and lived with him.
[576.92] After all,
[577.60] Shani accepted her after
so much happened.
[581.48] Who marries such girls?
[597.44] What happened? Why are
you looking at me like that?
[600.16] You too rejected her.
[608.68] Yes.
[612.16] Maybe that was the biggest
mistake of my life.
[616.44] Brother,
[618.48] Afnan and Alizay’s life will be
disturbed cause of Ramsha.
[621.88] And right now,
[624.32] Alizay and Afnan’s happiness
should matter for us.
[627.80] I admit that
[629.76] Ramsha is really worried, but
[632.28] this can surely not be
the solution for this.
[640.92] Oh God,
[645.52] even you were worried, Afsheen.
[652.28] I supported you.
[654.84] I kept you in this home,
[655.96] I didn’t let you lack anything.
[658.32] Do you remember?
[662.16] Brother, I am your sister.
[666.60] Ramsha is my daughter.
[668.48] The relation made in words
have no importance.
[670.56] It has importance for me.
[676.36] When I was unwell, then
[679.08] who cared for me day
and night? Huh?
[681.64] Who was it who didn’t care
about day and night?
[683.68] It is in front of you.
[685.48] Ramsha stayed up all night.
[687.96] She and I had no relation,
[690.28] but we had a relation of care.
[695.60] Afsheen, relations are
made through care.
[700.84] And the blood relations that have no
care in them are meaningless.
[719.00] Yes, aunt? You called me.
[732.80] Afsheen.
[738.56] How dare you raise your
hand at Ramsha?
[760.88] Aunt?
[762.60] Aunt.
[764.44] What happened?
[765.44] You had called me.
[767.16] I am not your aunt, at all.
[768.92] Do you understand?
[774.16] I have no relation with you.
[786.04] What happened to them?
[802.16] Mama, you are mad after
your brother.
[805.00] You don’t get tired of saying
brother this, brother that, mama.
[814.72] You always worried for him so much.
[817.08] You have always gone around him,
[819.12] but still how did he repay
you for all this?
[829.40] He insulted you for a stranger.
[834.92] Alizay, please,
[836.36] for God’s sake, be quiet.
[840.88] Mama, you are still telling me to be quiet,
after so much happened.
[851.52] He compared you to Ramsha.
[860.20] What would be a greater
insult for us here?
[865.72] Alizay, I cannot believe that
[868.24] brother compared me,
[870.80] that too with Ramsha.
[879.88] He has never spoken to me in
the tone he used with me.
[895.56] This is the same brother,
[897.88] who could give his life for me.
[901.36] That’s why I am so worried
for the past so many days.
[911.08] Anyway,
[912.40] you leave it don’t be so worried.
[914.60] What are you saying?
[915.88] How do I not get worried?
[925.08] I had not even thought that
[928.20] I would see such
a day in this home.
[940.76] You know
[945.04] this girl,
[946.88] Ramsha, has changed everything.
[956.56] She has even changed brother.
[959.36] Brother is not the
same now.
[1054.20] Afnan, a person
shouldn’t be so selfish.
[1057.72] You didn’t even ask
once how my day was.
[1060.60] Hey,
[1061.28] so tell me how was your day?
[1062.96] I wont tell you.
[1067.20] Okay fine,
[1068.32] I have kept down the ice cream,
[1070.48] I have switched off the phone.
[1071.68] Tell me, madam, how was your day?
[1073.36] What happened?
[1074.04] I had a great day,
[1075.32] but you know what happened?
[1076.92] A lot of YouTubers came
home to interview me.
[1080.20] Oh.
[1080.92] Mama didn’t give me permission.
[1082.76] You know, I am getting
so many calls,
[1084.76] so many messages,
[1085.92] people want to meet me,
[1087.32] they want to interview,
[1088.44] they want to sit and talk to me.
[1089.76] They want to know about me.
[1091.20] But my family is not
giving me permission.
[1100.40] What happened?
[1101.64] Afnan, my friend Hania,
[1104.00] her boyfriend shot her
with a gun in front of me.
[1106.60] She died over there.
[1108.08] You know, then police thought
[1109.36] that it was my fault,
[1110.60] they put me in the lockup.
[1111.20] Quiet. Quiet. Be quiet.
[1119.16] I am here.
[1121.32] Now everything will be fine.
[1123.76] What sort of a girl are you, man?
[1127.40] You are even talking in this condition.
[1129.80] You are talking…
[1132.48] Thank you, Afnan.
[1133.56] Thank you so much.
[1138.36] It is okay, and you are welcome.
[1198.40] If like humans, plants too
[1200.80] get love and affection, they blossom.
[1203.56] See it is the turn of this pot today.
[1207.12] You are right, uncle.
[1215.72] You know, uncle,
[1217.00] I was thinking why don’t
I join the academy?
[1220.68] Hey, yes,
[1221.44] that is something good.
[1222.40] In fact, I will do one thing,
[1223.80] I will call the academy,
[1225.72] I will talk to them.
[1227.48] Really, uncle?
[1228.96] This will be great.
[1230.64] Thank you so much.
[1231.80] Live long.
[1232.96] I am saying child,
if I talk to them,
[1234.88] then you join the academy
from tomorrow.
[1238.52] God bless my father,
[1241.64] he used to say that the
one who wastes time,
[1243.68] times wastes them.
[1255.08] So, every moment is precious when
you are trying to get education, right?
[1265.08] You are absolutely right, uncle.
[1267.16] Thank you so much.
[1272.68] But now stop it, uncle, you are tired.
[1275.20] Go and rest for a while,
[1276.44] I will do all this.
[1278.32] What did I do? You did all the work.
[1291.88] Yes, that’s what my age calls for.
[1293.28] Okay, this is the last pot,
[1294.76] don’t start any other work now.
[1325.36] Ramsha.
[1328.12] Yes?
[1329.04] Where are you going?
[1330.56] Why are you going?
[1335.48] Why?
[1342.56] Do you want something?
[1348.44] Why?
[1360.88] Now can we only talk when
I want something?
[1372.60] Can we not talk apart from that?
[1375.96] No.
[1395.08] What has happened to you,
Ramsha?
[1398.12] I am noticing you are really ignoring me.
[1409.84] You ignored me the same
way in the morning,
[1411.60] you didn’t even talk to me.
[1421.08] If I have made a mistake,
then tell me.
[1430.60] If you are upset,
[1431.56] if you have any complaints,
then at least say it.
[1435.92] I have no complaints.
[1440.04] Then why are you doing this?
[1443.72] Because I want to stay in this home.
[1453.76] I don’t want anyone’s life gets
disturbed because of me.
[1465.08] I hope you understand
what I am trying to say.
[1507.60] Greetings.
[1509.36] Greetings.
[1513.76] One minute Afnan.
[1514.84] Huh?
[1516.96] What is this?
[1518.12] What?
[1519.04] Where did you get soil in
your coat from?
[1522.56] I…actually…
[1523.96] I will tell you.
[1525.40] Ramsha put this soil.
[1527.40] I had seen it on her hand.
[1530.92] No, no, you are taking it wrong.
[1532.36] You have a misunderstanding…
[1533.20] I am not understanding
anything wrong, Afnan.
[1535.72] I couldn’t even imagine
you could fall so low.
[1538.96] You two have crossed all the limits.
[1541.08] What nonsense is this?
[1542.80] I am not speaking nonsense.
[1544.32] I am speaking the truth.
[1546.08] You are spending time with that
cheap girl leaving your wife?
[1548.88] Shut up.
[1551.08] Just shut up!
[1553.76] If you say anything cheap after this,
[1558.04] I will not spend a moment
with you after that.
[1592.88] Brother, did you call me?
[1594.96] Greetings.
[1597.60] Greetings.
[1599.20] Afsheen, doesn’t have
some necessities.
[1610.40] You go to the market with her.
[1621.44] She will get what she wants.
[1629.44] Okay?
[1632.40] Yes, fine brother. I will go.
[1636.36] Then just get ready.
[1643.00] I spoke to her,
[1644.28] when she comes then you go.
[1646.40] Okay?
[1650.68] Sure.
[1680.48] Now just buy necessary things.
[1683.00] If things are being distributed for free,
[1684.64] this doesn’t mean that you
get what you want.
[1687.32] I had said no to uncle,
[1688.88] he insisted and sent me with you.
[1690.56] Yes. You are really innocent.
[1692.00] He told you and you went, right?
[1694.32] I can see
[1695.56] how you are robbing my brother.
[1700.00] Why did you stop?
[1702.24] Stop these dramas. Stop crying.
[1706.40] I don’t want to get anything.
[1707.48] I want to go home. Come on.
[1709.00] When you didn’t want to get anything,
[1710.28] then why did you bring me here?
[1712.00] Stop these dramas of yours.
[1713.56] If you get empty handed like this, then
[1715.28] brother will feel that maybe
[1716.76] I told you not to get anything.
[1719.24] Get the things you need and come home.
[1721.76] I don’t have time for
these dramas of yours,
[1724.60] then we will go home.
[1725.68] Come on, quickly.
[1756.00] Ramsha!
[1805.32] Take these bags and put them in the room.
[1807.00] Okay, madam.
[1814.04] Aunt, for a moment,
[1815.44] I felt I would lose my life.
[1823.24] That car crossed so close from me,
[1825.52] I felt that someone
[1826.28] was trying to kill me on purpose.
[1829.44] No, no,
[1830.52] why would anyone kill you 
on purpose, Ramsha?
[1839.44] You know people have
 no manners to drive.
[1844.16] No aunt,
[1845.24] whether you accept it or not,
[1846.84] whoever was in it wanted to 
take my life on purpose.
[1849.84] They did this on purpose,
[1851.92] so that I…
[1852.36] No Ramsha,
[1853.36] that was just an accident.
[1855.60] You don’t think so much.
[1859.88] I don’t know, aunt.
[1861.56] I feel someone did all this on purpose.
[1865.52] I…
[1866.12] Ramsha,
[1867.76] don’t mention this to brother or Afnan.
[1870.80] Look, they will worry for no reason.
[1873.20] Greetings.
[1874.32] Greetings.
[1876.44] All okay, you came early.
[1879.28] Yes, aunt, the meetings
ended soon today,
[1882.28] so that’s why.
[1882.80] What happened? All okay?
[1884.88] Yes. Yes. Everything is okay.
[1903.64] I took her shopping, so she is tired.
[1907.96] Ramsha, you go to
your room and rest.
[1911.32] Sure.
[1915.96] Will you have tea?
[1917.64] If you are making tea,
then I will have it.
[1921.56] Yes, let me just change,
then I will make it.
[1953.16] Greetings.
[1956.92] What happened?
[1957.48] Why are you looking
at me like that?
[1960.08] Where are you coming from?
[1962.80] From the office.
[1965.52] You are lying.
[1967.32] You didn’t go to the office today.
[1970.36] Why would I lie to you?
[1971.72] I am coming from the office, right now.
[1977.84] What is wrong?
[1980.60] You got the attack made
on Ramsha, right?
[1984.88] Attack? What attack?
[1988.20] I don’t know about any attack.
[1990.60] You know well what attack
I am talking about.
[1994.76] I recognized your car.
[1999.32] It was you, right?
[2009.40] I am asking you something.
[2013.16] Yes,
[2014.44] I was the one who attacked.
[2021.32] But she has good luck,
[2022.96] she survived this time.
[2029.72] Next time this wont happen,
[2031.24] I promise you.
[2036.08] Alizay, you want to kill her?
[2038.48] Mama, if I could I will kill
her right this moment.
[2049.92] Because if she lives then
[2051.48] me and Afnan can
 never be happy.
[2054.20] Alizay, stupid girl,
[2056.72] what do you think?
[2058.40] You will kill Ramsha
[2060.04] and you feel you will come
 closer to Afnan like this?
[2070.20] Nothing like this will happen.
[2072.28] If Afnan even gets 
a hint of your thinking,
[2080.52] then he will not even hate you, 
love is out of question.
[2087.68] Then what do I do, mama?
[2097.88] You tell me.
[2099.52] I cannot see him going close 
to Ramsha with my own eyes.
[2103.68] I will die.
[2105.60] Mama, I will die without him.
[2116.64] I will die, mama,
[2118.08] Do you understand me?
[2127.12] I cannot see this.
[2138.08] I cannot see Afnan
[2139.44] becoming someone else’s.
[2187.04] Then what do I do, mama?
[2189.64] You tell me.
[2191.16] I cannot see him going close to
 Ramsha with my own eyes.
[2195.88] Do you understand 
what I am saying?
[2198.56] If Afnan, gets close to Ramsha,
[2201.40] I will die.
[2204.96] I will die, mama,
[2206.52] Do you understand me?
[2213.56] I admit that Ramsha is 
really worried, but
[2218.04] this can surely not be 
the solution for this.
[2227.28] Oh God,
[2231.16] even you were worried, Afsheen.
[2238.00] I supported you.
[2240.56] I kept you in this home,
[2241.68] I didn’t let you lack anything.
[2243.84] Do you remember?
[2248.00] Brother, I am your sister.
[2252.24] Ramsha is my daughter.
[2259.12] The relation made in 
words have no importance.
[2261.28] It has importance for me.
[2265.68] And the blood relations that have
 no care in them are meaningless.
[2285.12] Hello.
