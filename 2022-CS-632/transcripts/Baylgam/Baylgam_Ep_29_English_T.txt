[21.28] What will be my work?
[22.60] I mean, what will be my job?
[24.56] What do I …
[26.28] Your job, hmm..
[31.60] When I come to the office,
[37.12] you will have to ask
me for tea or water,
[48.36] you will have to take care of me,
[57.52] you will have to chit chat with me
[64.84] and rest you are smart
enough to know.
[77.48] You ill-mannered.
[79.88] Noble girls have stopped
going out of home because of people like you,
[84.48] despite needing a job,
[86.76] those girls cannot leave their homes
[89.28] because scoundrels
like you don’t let them work.
[92.24] Hey, go away,
[93.96] I know girls like you very well.
[96.52] Really?
[98.60] What do you know?
[99.92] Tell me,
[100.80] what do you know about us?
[103.16] All the time that you
invested in knowing us,
[105.68] if you had put that time into
knowing your character,
[109.44] you would have known
what a disgusting man you are,
[112.72] how scary you are!
[114.80] Have you ever seen
yourself in the mirror?
[116.84] You look like a well dressed animal.
[119.04] Shut the hell up else
I will get you thrown out of here.
[122.12] Get me thrown out,
[123.48] get me out right now,
[125.44] Hello, excuse me?
[126.28] call everyone,
so everyone should know
[128.16] what you actually are,
[130.08] Call everyone.
[130.68] Mr Liaquat what has happened?
[193.00] Whatever happened was wrong
[195.04] that shouldn’t have happened but
[197.12] I will get this matter investigated,
[199.80] though you
[202.84] shouldn’t have created
a scene like this in our office.
[211.20] I shouldn’t have created a scene?
[214.04] It was very important
to create this scene
[220.80] else you or the people
of your office
[223.64] would have never found
out the reality of this man.
[233.12] You never know how many
girls has he harassed,
[235.56] how many girls went
back crying from here,
[240.84] do you have any idea?
[242.88] Are you informed?
[244.52] Look,
[246.16] Mr Liaquat has been here
for the past 10 years
[253.88] and there has never been such
a complaint about him in all these years,
[256.12] I can’t believe on
whatever you are saying
[259.84] Wow,
[261.36] it has been 10 years?
[263.92] He must have taken advantage of
God knows how many helpless girls.
[276.44] Mr Afnan, 10 years is a lot,
[279.80] if I hadn’t spoken up today,
[282.00] you wouldn’t even know
for the next 10 years
[289.64] because you just care about
a girl’s qualifications,
[293.68] not their character.
[297.08] For your kind information,
[298.72] we do business here,
[301.12] this is not a marriage bureau
[302.76] where we must find matches for people
[304.68] and collect their personal history,
[307.52] we just care about people’s
qualifications here.
[310.76] So then okay,
[312.68] you don’t need to hire
female staff at all,
[319.36] when you cannot provide them
with a secure environment
[322.60] so then hire male staff,
[324.40] not ladies,
[325.88] do you understand?
[326.76] Miss Ramsha,
[329.84] I guess you are forgetting
[332.60] that this is my office,
[335.04] whatever I command
will happen here,
[337.64] and that is why keep your
suggestions to yourself.
[341.96] I know,
[344.00] you make decisions without knowing
what is right or wrong
[350.56] because you just think about yourself,
[354.64] that is why today you are definitely
a successful businessman
[360.44] but you are not a good person.
[444.56] Wow,
[446.20] it has been 10 years?
[448.64] He must have taken advantage of
God knows how many helpless girls.
[454.40] because you just care about
a girl’s qualifications,
[458.52] not their character.
[463.64] you make decisions without
knowing what is right or wrong
[466.84] because you just
think about yourself,
[469.84] that is why today
[471.92] you are definitely
a successful businessman
[475.72] but you are not a good person.
[484.80] Umm, Miss Ramsha
just came right now,
[487.92] yes, yes, yes,
[489.76] bring her CV to me please.
[493.84] Thank you.
[518.92] What is wrong with you?
[521.72] Why were you saying
that you will marry me?
[524.28] How did even this come
to your brain? Tell me?
[527.40] what is wrong with you, Afnan?
[529.20] You love me,
[531.00] if you won’t marry me,
[531.88] then who else will you marry?
[532.76] What is wrong with you?
[535.12] I just talk to you nicely
a couple of times,
[536.52] does that mean
I will marry you?
[539.92] I thought that she is
probably a naïve girl
[541.76] who might need my guidance
[544.04] and if I can make her a good friend
[545.92] and guide her, save her
from bad people,
[548.32] so this was not love,
[550.20] that doesn’t mean,
I want to marry you.
[561.92] Do you actually not love me?
[564.80] yes, I truly, falsely, in any world,
[567.48] I do not love you, Ramsha,
[571.24] but why don’t you
understand this Ramsha?
[587.12] I don’t understand myself,
[589.64] a girl who he used to dislike
so much until yesterday,
[593.36] how does he have so much
love and sympathy for her today
[595.96] that he decided to
make her his daughter in law
[598.16] and has also asked
talk to sister in law about it.
[602.12] Whatever it is, mom,
I am not going to marry her.
[604.96] So why are you telling me?
[606.64] Go talk to your dad,
[608.40] this is not my decision,
this is your dad’s decision.
[610.72] Mom, you know it very
well I cannot say no to him,
[613.80] whatever it is, you go talk to him,
[615.52] tell him he doesn’t like her.
[618.00] Shani,
[618.92] all of you have decided to annoy me,
[622.64] I will not talk to him about anything,
[624.40] go and talk to him yourself
about anything you want to say.
[626.40] I don’t understand dad,
[628.48] what has gotten into him all of a sudden?
[630.56] I should marry the girl no one
is even asking? Wow.
[634.56] Oh!
[637.96] That’s how bad Ramsha is?
[640.16] You are not so pure either,
[641.96] don’t forget what you do yourself.
[644.00] I remember it very well,
[645.00] there is no need to talk about the
same thing again and again,
[648.12] I just won’t marry her,
understand this.
[652.20] Oh God! I am being a sandwich
between both son and father.
[676.44] For your kind information,
[678.12] we do business here,
[680.36] this is not a marriage bureau
[682.12] where we must find
matches for people
[684.04] and collect their personal history,
[686.88] we just care about people’s
qualifications here.
[690.12] So then okay,
[692.12] you don’t need to hire
female staff at all,
[695.60] when you cannot provide them
with a secure environment
[698.72] so then hire male staff,
[700.44] not ladies,
[701.92] do you understand?
[702.92] Miss Ramsha,
[706.08] I guess you are forgetting
[708.80] that this is my office,
[711.24] whatever I command will happen here,
[713.84] and that is why keep your
suggestions to yourself.
[721.64] How was your interview?
[725.12] You can’t get the job so easily.
[728.56] Hmm, true that,
[732.56] why don’t you apply for
teaching in some school?
[738.24] Didn’t you have a worse
suggestion to give than this?
[741.76] They make us work so hard
[743.88] and didn’t even pay us the fee of
two students in the name of salary.
[747.92] They would keep the whole
fees of every child themselves
[751.40] but they die when it’s about
giving salaries to the teachers.
[757.24] They make us work so hard
in the name of artwork,
[761.04] I don’t want to do this job,
[762.68] especially teaching.
[766.40] You are absolutely right.
[768.16] Do you know,
[769.40] dad was very angry
about you doing a job.
[772.80] What else does your father know,
[774.92] he just gets angry.
[778.20] Aren’t you scared of Dad?
[784.16] When a person gets alone,
[787.64] they either become a
coward or very brave.
[793.00] What are you out of them?
[796.96] What do you think?
[801.12] I feel you are very brave and smart.
[826.20] Didn’t you tell sister in law
[829.32] that girls don’t do a job in our family?
[835.48] Anwar, when sister in
law allowed Ramsha
[838.36] then who am I or you to stop her?
[840.96] And like she will stop if we tell her to?
[844.88] Okay, hmm,
[850.36] then do one thing,
[852.96] talk to sister in law about Ramsha
and Shani’s marriage
[858.08] then where and how to stop her,
[861.60] that will be my duty.
[865.16] Anwar, first convince your son for it,
[868.60] he won’t marry Ramsha at all,
he doesn’t like her.
[872.16] What difference does that make?
[874.36] When I have decided
[875.88] that Shani will marry Ramsha,
[877.68] then he will marry her,
[879.72] the decision has been made.
[883.36] Anwar,
[885.64] you must still rethink once
[887.16] because Ramsha and Shani have
completely different mentalities,
[892.28] Shani doesn’t like Ramsha.
[894.68] What is wrong with you Salma?
[897.88] Have you forgotten me?
[898.80] Don’t you know me?
[900.60] If I have made a decision,
[903.08] I must have thought it through,
[906.12] do you understand?
[907.88] What do you mean?
[918.96] If that girl wouldn’t have made noise,
[920.72] then we would have never found out.
[923.36] Hmm,
[924.80] so what will you suggest?
[926.16] Sir, I think we should file a case.
[928.76] Hmm.
[930.76] We should definitely file
a case against him,
[934.44] it is very important to punish such
people for their wrongdoings
[938.80] but the problem is that
[939.96] even if we file a case against him,
[942.40] any girl that would have
been harassed by him
[945.00] will never come forward in the court,
[947.00] this is the problem of our society,
[949.40] where the girls get harassed their families
[952.32] never let them come in front of the world.
[955.56] I wish
[957.80] I wish that families get the courage and
[960.88] help us in getting such people punished.
[964.04] You are right sir.
[966.32] Hmm, anyway,
[967.36] we will talk on this matter again,
[969.12] we will call a meeting,
[970.84] but for now,
[971.52] go and meet Mr Faheem,
[972.60] he has been waiting for you
for quite some time now.
[974.24] Yes, sir.
[981.72] Dial the lawyer’s number.
[990.24] Come, Salma.
[992.08] I swear I was just thinking
to go make tea
[995.60] and you brought the tea.
[996.84] See, the hearts are
connected with each other,
[999.36] you just thought of it
and I brought tea.
[1003.60] Ramsha will be here anytime,
[1011.44] my daughter has been going
around giving interviews to get a job
[1015.44] but it has been so many days
and there is no luck.
[1017.96] Sister in law,
[1019.60] you should get Ramsha married,
[1022.56] everything will get solved on its own,
[1025.16] her husband will take
all the responsibility.
[1028.80] Salma, there is no mother
who wouldn’t want
[1030.24] her daughter to get married,
[1033.76] even I want it
[1039.00] but what can I do, the situation
is not the same now,
[1042.84] I cannot even get her
married if I want to.
[1045.60] Sister in law,
[1046.92] it just takes a yes from you
[1049.76] and Ramsha can get married today.
[1052.96] What did you say?
[1053.88] Hey is there any proposal for her?
[1056.44] Salma, quickly tell me?
[1057.96] Who is the family?
[1058.88] Where do they live? Tell me.
[1062.32] Sister in law, the match is in the house
[1064.48] why would anyone come
from the outside?
[1068.40] What do you mean?
I don’t understand.
[1070.56] Sister in law, Anwar wants Shani
and Ramsha to get married.
[1083.88] Sister in law, I am telling you the truth,
[1086.00] he wants them kids to get married
[1088.04] and he was saying that
[1089.56] if I won’t be concerned for
my widow sister in law
[1092.28] or my niece so who else will?
[1095.64] And how will I face my
late brother in the future?
[1107.56] Okay, have tea.
[1110.32] yes...
[1150.68] Brother, are you busy?
[1154.20] No, no, where would I be busy?
[1156.84] You tell me, is everything okay?
Come sit.
[1162.80] Brother, I wanted to talk to you
[1167.56] but then I thought that
[1168.80] you are busy so I didn’t.
[1173.84] You are embarrassing me,
[1175.76] listen even if I am busy
[1177.84] you can say what you want to.
[1181.48] Look, the love of sisters
and their rights
[1183.60] are very much on their brothers.
[1187.16] Thank you, brother,
[1188.96] I just wanted to talk about
Alizey and Afnan’s marriage.
[1194.96] Let’s get them married now.
[1197.12] In the name of Allah!
[1198.04] Do however you think is better.
[1201.20] You have to do the preparations from
both the girl's and boy’s side,
[1204.04] so do whatever you feel is right.
[1206.56] Okay brother,
[1207.96] I just wanted that
[1209.72] we invite a few close people from
the family and a few elders,
[1213.40] and let’s fix the wedding date
[1215.28] so that the family knows too and
[1218.32] there will be some sort of
celebration at home too.
[1220.84] Afsheen, do whatever
you think is right,
[1223.44] you are the mother of the girl
[1225.84] and aunt of the groom,
[1227.08] can anyone stop you?
[1228.60] Just do however you like
[1229.84] and then we will make
arrangements accordingly,
[1231.56] okay?
[1232.40] Okay brother.
[1235.24] And don’t get formal, okay?
[1237.32] okay.
[1241.52] Thank God.
[1251.12] Who is it?
[1259.76] Greetings.
[1260.92] Greetings.
[1263.04] How are you?
[1264.20] Absolutely fine. How are you?
[1266.36] I am fine.
[1268.88] You look very tired today.
[1270.44] I gave interview at 3 places,
[1272.44] just pray I get a call
from somewhere.
[1274.96] Let’s see what happens.
[1276.92] If God wills.
[1279.68] Don’t worry Ramsha,
[1281.28] you will get a job
[1281.96] and you will get it very soon,
[1283.16] okay?
[1283.76] Shall I get water for you?
[1284.80] Yes, listen to me,
[1286.28] bring food along with water too,
[1288.92] I have just had a cup of
tea since morning,
[1291.96] I am very hungry.
[1294.12] okay do one thing,
I will get you water,
[1295.68] and I will put the food for
you on dining table, okay?
[1336.88] Unknown number?
[1340.48] Hello? Greetings,
[1342.84] who is it?
[1343.88] Greetings,
[1346.28] I don’t thing that I need
to tell you my name.
[1356.80] I didn’t recognize? Who is it?
[1359.96] You do recognize me,
[1362.56] Afnan speaking.
[1367.96] Yes, tell me,
[1369.48] why have you called me?
[1372.92] I saw your CV,
[1376.60] you qualify for this job,
[1380.04] you can join from tomorrow morning.
[1385.44] I will ask the relevant people
[1388.00] to give you an appointment letter and
[1389.92] teach you the work too
[1391.48] Thank you so much but
I don’t want your charity.
[1395.24] I am not giving you charity,
[1397.20] I am giving you a job.
[1400.52] Thank you so much,
[1401.88] but I don’t need anything given by you.
[1405.48] Don’t talk rubbish,
[1408.96] I know very well that you need this job.
[1416.68] I needed you as well,
[1424.00] anyway,
[1425.20] stop feeling pity on me, Mr Afnan.
[1430.92] Ramsha, I am not feeling pity on you,
[1436.52] nor am I sympathizing with you.
[1442.68] You are qualified for the
job you applied for.
[1447.28] I said,
[1448.48] I don’t need anything from you,
[1452.88] don’t ever call me again.
[1492.76] Ramsha, water.
[1495.56] Thank you, Annie.
[1501.24] Umm,
[1503.28] do you know,
[1506.88] yours and brother’s marriage
is being discussed.
[1536.28] Salma has just spoken to me about it,
[1539.16] I haven’t given her any
response yet so don’t worry.
[1542.60] So mom, why are you thinking
so much to respond?
[1544.92] You should have refused.
[1552.04] Mom?
[1555.44] I am talking to you
[1556.72] and you are fixing the
bedsheet here?
[1558.80] You already refused aunt once
[1560.84] so then what is the problem now?
[1564.20] Ramsha, things were different back then,
[1569.84] the situation is not the same anymore,
[1573.16] try to understand,
[1575.16] the situation has changed now.
[1580.84] So did you forget what
Shani did to me?
[1587.16] Don’t you remember anything?
[1591.04] I didn’t forget anything,
[1598.84] I remember everything,
[1602.44] you leaving this house,
[1606.60] your marriage being called off
[1613.04] and then
[1615.44] your dad passing away
due to this news,
[1623.60] and then whatever Shani did taking
advantage of all these matters,
[1627.80] I remember everything,
[1628.48] I haven’t forgotten anything,
I haven’t forgotten anything.
[1630.56] Mom, I am so sorry,
[1633.76] forgive me, I didn't mean to hurt you,
[1637.72] I didn’t want to hurt you,
[1639.72] I was just reminding you mom.
[1642.20] My child,
[1645.24] the situation is not like before,
[1647.84] your dad was alive earlier,
[1651.48] but now,
[1653.24] I cannot take any decision alone.
[1659.00] I feel like,
[1661.04] I feel like we are standing in the
streets with dead end,
[1664.32] and even if I close the windows
and doors by the fear of storm,
[1669.76] we will still die of suffocation,
my child.
[1674.40] Try to understand,
[1676.28] I have become weak, my child,
[1678.52] I have become a widow,
[1680.56] I cannot carry any burden of your
wrong decision, my child,
[1685.56] I cannot now.
[1696.24] Listen to me? Stop crying,
[1699.12] sit here,
[1700.44] sit here,
[1702.48] mom, look, listen to me,
[1706.48] whatever you want… mom?
[1713.20] Whatever you will say, it will happen.
[1722.68] Stay blessed,
[1723.92] stay happy my child.
[1730.88] stay happy
[1733.84] Please stop crying.
[1788.44] Listen?
[1789.28] Hmm?
[1789.88] Shani wants to talk to
you about something.
[1795.40] Yes? Say it?
[1801.04] Umm,
[1802.64] do we have to go to the shop early today?
[1807.32] Today?
[1810.00] My child, we have to go early everyday.
[1816.04] If you will go early,
[1819.00] I would be grateful to you,
[1819.92] that would be very nice,
[1822.12] I have given the keys to Arshad,
[1824.04] he will open the shop,
[1824.80] you just get there in time.
[1827.40] Okay.
[1828.92] Did sister in law dive any response?
[1833.48] Umm, she was saying that 
she will think and reply.
[1841.20] Now tell me,
[1843.72] what is there to think about?
[1846.08] Like her daughter has a queue 
of good proposals here,
[1850.44] she will think and reply.
[1852.76] No whatever it is,
[1855.08] Anwar, I cannot impose 
my choice on her
[1857.44] that answer me now.
[1859.24] Okay, let her think,
[1864.36] I will also see how much she can think.
[1868.24] I am going to brother Safdar’s place,
[1870.52] do get to the shop in time.
[1872.00] Okay.
[1872.60] Do you understand?
[1874.08] Don’t be late.
[1879.28] What is this way?
[1880.80] You were supposed to talk to dad
[1881.88] that I won’t marry her.
[1884.56] Shani, your dad was sitting here,
[1886.24] you should have
 spoken to him yourself.
[1888.08] Mom, if I had to talk myself,
 why would I even ask you?
[1891.00] Shani, keep me away
 from this matter,
[1893.40] whatever you want to say, 
say it yourself to your father,
[1895.88] don’t eat my head.
[1897.76] Mom, you know that dad 
won’t listen to me,
[1900.64] why do you want to make a joke 
out of me in front of everyone?
[1903.16] My friends will make fun of me,
[1904.28] they will say that your family made
 you a sacrificial animal
[1907.52] and if she is not getting proposals
[1909.16] because of what she does,
[1910.00] that doesn’t mean 
I should marry her.
[1911.80] So I didn’t make this match,
[1913.56] your dad did, go talk to him.
[1915.56] Okay I admit
[1917.76] but you end this at least?
[1920.48] No I cannot d anything,
[1923.92] my hands have always been 
tied in front of your father.
[1940.68] Brother, your tea.
[1941.64] To hell with the tea.
[1947.08] Mom, your tea.
[1948.48] Drop it on my head,
[1949.48] you are here to eat my brain,
[1950.80] their brain doesn’t work at all,
[1954.08] what sort of environment is
 going on at home, but tea.
[1959.68] Have tea, there is no other work.
[1968.20] What the hell?
[1970.28] Were there any less problems
[1972.40] that now this Shani’s problems
[1973.96] are being imposed on me, as well?
[1976.16] I am not even getting a job,
[1980.36] how will I convince mom 
if I don’t get a job?
[1987.48] Oh God! Get me a good job,
[1991.56] please solve my problems.
[2006.00] Oh yes,
[2008.16] why didn’t I think of it earlier?
[2011.68] I should call sister Shiza,
[2014.96] I can get any work in her channel,
[2020.32] sister Shiza gave me so much
 love at the morning show,
[2025.64] gave me so much protocol,
[2028.16] if I talk to her
[2030.24] she will definitely do
 something for me.
[2033.80] Let me call her.
[2056.08] Hello?
[2057.08] Greetings.
[2058.64] Greetings, who is this?
[2060.56] Komal? You are Komal, right?
[2063.24] Ramsha speaking.
[2065.28] Ramsha who?
[2068.52] I guess you forgot,
[2071.44] I am the same Ramsha
[2072.88] who came to your morning
 show with her mother
[2076.40] and my video went viral by
 the name of shopping girl?
[2080.92] Oh Ramsha, yes, yes, yes,
[2082.52] I remember now, 
so tell me how are you?
[2087.64] Can I speak to sister Shiza?
[2090.40] Regarding what?
[2092.32] Actually
[2094.12] I needed a job
[2096.20] so I thought of talking to sister Shiza,
[2099.12] I wanted to work in your
 team with you people.
[2103.00] Oh so that is what you wanted?
[2105.68] Yes.
[2106.76] Look Ramsha, as soon 
as Miss Shiza gets free
[2109.44] I will tell her about your call
 and your concern, okay?
[2113.60] Okay, once she gets free do make me…

[2186.88] I needed you as well,
[2190.32] anyway,
[2191.48] stop feeling pity on me, Mr Afnan.
