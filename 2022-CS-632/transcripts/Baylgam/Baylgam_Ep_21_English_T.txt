[23.52] Alizay.
[25.16] What happened? Why didn’t you 
go to the office today?
[27.00] I went to the office. 
It started drizzling outside,
[30.12] so I came back. You know 
the situation the road gets into.
[32.92] Hey, when did it start raining?
[34.92] The sun was shining a little while back.
[37.48] It is Karachi’s weather. 
Very unpredictable.
[40.40] Yes.
[42.92] Alizay, shall we go?
Where? Outside?
[44.76] Yes.
[45.56] No, Afnan, you know I don’t like getting
 drenched in the rain.
[48.56] Oh come on, Alizay,
[50.00] this is the first rain of the season.
[51.72] There is no beautiful rain than this.
[53.96] It has its own fun to get drenched in it, 
like Ramsha says….
[60.92] Who, Ramsha?
[65.08] Ramsha is an employee in my office,
 newly hired.
[68.88] She was saying it one day, 
so the thought came to my head.
[71.12] But leave her,
[72.60] come on, you and I will go 
enjoy the rain. Come on.
[74.68] You leave this. Come on, 
lets make coffee
[77.24] and go to the terrace to 
enjoy the weather.
[78.96] You are saying such tasteless things,
[81.16] and you want to leave it and 
worry about food and drinks.
[84.16] What is wrong, Afnan?
[85.60] Look, if you want to live your life with me,
[87.72] then get used to listening to me.
[90.24] I want to live my life with you, 
that is why I gave this heart to you.
[94.04] I have to listen to your orders all my life.
[96.68] So get used to it from now on.
[98.48] Shall we go? Let’s prepare coffee.
[100.84] Man.
[102.96] Come on. Come.
[325.64] Water.
[327.00] Oh man, I just had to run out of water.
[362.00] What happened? 
Do you want something?
[364.24] Me?
[371.40] You.
[377.96] Have you gone mad?
[380.36] Are you in your senses?
[384.04] What did you say?
[389.64] You know, I realized something today.
[394.84] You are beautiful,
[398.44] but when your hair is wet,
[402.64] you look even better.
[405.20] Stop your nonsense here, Shani.
[410.52] Ill-mannered man,
[412.88] cheapster, get out of my way.
[428.08] He has no shame.
[430.84] He is a complete…
[433.60] What?
[435.28] What is your problem?
[438.24] My problem?
[442.36] My problem is that as much as 
I dislike you,
[446.60] I like you equally.
[448.88] Shani, get lost from here in two minutes
[452.36] or else I will teach you a lesson 
that you will never forget.
[456.32] What will you do?
[458.52] What will you do?
[459.80] Have you gone mad?
[461.20] I am telling you, leave me 
or else I will do something
[463.76] that you will remember all your life.
What will you do?
[465.36] You don’t agree?
[466.68] You don’t understand? 
You wont leave me?
[472.28] This is the answer for 
this question of yours.
[475.72] I did run from the home,
 I made a mistake,
[480.68] I didn’t commit a sin. 
Understand?
[483.44] Get lost from here.
[485.32] You wont agree like this. 
You are worth pushing out.
[487.92] Get lost from here.
[490.76] You can fool those outside, 
but not me.
[493.36] Do you understand?
Leave me.
[495.12] Leave me, Shani. 
Leave me.
[497.16] Mama. 
Mama.
[499.84] Mama. 
Mama.
[504.76] What happened?
Ramsha.
[505.92] What happened, Ramsha?
[507.72] What happened child? 
What has happened?
[510.48] Mama.
What happened?
[512.56] Mama, Shani.
[517.08] Shani.
[520.16] Mama.
[521.80] Mama, she is lying.
[523.36] Earlier daughters used to be 
unsafe outside the home,
[526.72] now will daughters be unsafe 
in their own homes like this?
[530.08] Salma, if a person cannot trust their own,
then who will they trust?
[534.72] Shameless. Disrespectful.
[536.68] Did you not have shame?
[538.16] You trampled the respect 
of your mother’s family.
[662.12] Mehnaz.
[669.60] Mehnaz.
[672.64] Bring me a glass of water.
[681.92] Okay, that’s it, child.
[683.40] Mama.
Okay my love, stop crying.
[685.20] You are tiring yourself for no reason.
[687.04] Mama.
[692.28] What happened?
[694.36] Papa. Papa.
[698.96] Papa.
[700.96] What happened, child? 
Why are you crying?
[704.88] Papa.
[706.80] Hey, tell me something.
[708.24] Will someone tell me what happened?
[710.52] Yes, that…
[712.76] Ramsha’s friend who got shot,
[716.28] she was telling me her story.
[718.36] She got emotional hearing the story,
that is why she is crying.
[724.32] Okay child, what had to happen,
had happened.
[726.96] Pray for her that God forgives her.
[736.76] What happened?
Why are you crying, child?
[740.64] Okay Ramsha,
[742.64] my love, go to your room.
[744.12] Go and wash your hands and face.
I will come. Come on, go.
[760.36] If you talk about the past in front of 
her again and again,
[764.88] then she will feel hurt.
[766.96] You should be careful.
[769.44] Sure.
[771.76] Yes, you have a seat. 
I will serve food.
[774.88] Serve food later.
[777.88] First give me water.
[779.68] Sure. Sure. I will just bring it.
[856.40] Get lost from here in two minutes
[858.68] or else I will teach you a lesson 
that you will never forget.
[862.76] What will you do?
[864.84] What will you do?
[866.16] Have you gone mad?
[867.48] I am telling you, leave me 
or else I will do something
[869.72] that you will remember all your life.
What will you do?
[871.68] You don’t agree?
[872.88] You don’t understand? 
You wont leave me?
[878.56] This is the answer for 
this question of yours.
[881.92] I did run from the home, 
I made a mistake,
[886.76] I didn’t commit a sin.
 Understand?
[889.80] Get lost from here.
[891.60] You wont agree like this. 
You are worth pushing out.
[894.08] Get lost from here.
[897.04] You can fool those outside, 
but not me.
[899.88] Do you understand?
[908.40] Hey, tell me something.
[911.00] Will someone tell me what happened?
[912.60] Yes, that…
[915.00] Ramsha’s friend who got shot,
[918.36] she was telling me her story.
[920.28] She got emotional hearing the story, 
that is why she is crying.
[926.48] Okay child, what had to happen,
had happened.
[929.08] Pray for her that God forgives her.
[935.72] What happened? 
Why are you crying, child?
[939.80] Okay Ramsha, my love, 
go to your room.
[943.08] Go and wash your hands and face. 
I will come. Come on, go.
[1012.20] Mama,
[1014.24] did something happen at home?
[1019.96] Why? Did you talk to someone?
[1022.76] No,
[1024.40] there is a sudden silence at home,
[1026.84] and Ramsha and elder mama didn’t 
come for breakfast, so I thought.
[1032.88] Did you say something to elder mama?
[1036.68] Mama, now what Ramsha had to do,
she did it.
[1041.60] What had to happen, has happened.
[1043.12] Taunting elder mama on the same thing
or insulting her is not right.
[1047.84] What fault does that poor thing 
have in this?
[1063.40] Greetings.
[1083.72] Bring my tea in my room.
[1097.32] Did something happen, brother?
[1104.20] I will go give mama her tea.
[1129.60] Mama.
[1131.72] Mama, she is lying.
[1133.40] Earlier daughters used to be 
unsafe outside the home,
[1136.84] now will daughters be unsafe 
in their own homes like this?
[1140.16] Salma, if a person cannot trust their own,
then who will they trust?
[1144.64] Shameless. Disrespectful.
[1146.68] Did you not have shame?
[1148.08] You trampled the respect of 
your mother’s family.
[1152.12] What was left lacking 
in your upbringing?
[1155.52] Speak up. Tell me,
[1157.56] you shameless man.
[1219.36] Why have you come here?
[1221.56] I don’t even want to see your face. 
Go from here.
[1230.20] Mama, I know you are upset with me,
[1233.44] and I have hurt your heart.
[1238.12] Whatever I did was wrong,
[1241.88] but believe me, mama,
[1244.24] it was not all my fault. 
You know Ramsha well.
[1247.36] You know her actions.
[1251.32] She is the one who misled me 
or else I cannot even think that.
[1254.64] If your own sister was 
in Ramsha’s place, then?
[1259.36] Mama, what nonsense are you speaking?
[1261.00] I am speaking the same thing 
you cannot tolerate.
[1265.80] If someone has a bad character,
[1269.48] then it in no way means it is allowed 
for you to commit a sin.
[1276.08] Why did you forget
[1278.08] that you will only be questioned 
about your actions,
[1281.08] not for someone else’s actions.
[1285.68] What about the one who instigates you
to commit a sin?
[1289.08] Fear God.
[1292.40] Instead of seeking forgiveness 
on your sin,
[1294.08] you are still giving justifications?
[1298.76] This is the clear difference 
between a man
[1301.72] and the satan that the man seeks 
forgiveness for their sins.
[1309.20] May God the capability to truly 
seek forgiveness on your sins,
[1311.84] so that sister in law and 
Ramsha forgive you.
[1316.32] I too am the mother of a daughter,
[1319.52] and I can feel the intensity of their pain 
in my veins.
[1357.12] Mama, please.
[1358.72] Mama, please try and understand.
[1361.20] Mama, please take my phone but at least 
let me complete my studies.
[1365.36] Mama, I wont use my mobile, 
I have to study.
[1368.12] Please. Please, let me complete my studies.
[1370.24] Shush.
[1425.36] That is fine,
[1426.64] but where was Ramsha for so many days.
[1428.68] I had come a couple of times earlier too,
 but she…
[1430.88] I had told you earlier,
[1433.96] Ramsha had gone to visit her aunt 
in Nawabshah.
[1437.16] Really?
[1438.48] But people are saying different things.
[1442.28] Anyway, I don’t care about 
what people say.
[1445.52] The more the people, 
the greater the gossip.
[1447.48] Why do you care about people? 
People say all sorts of things.
[1452.76] People make a mountain 
out of a mole hill.
[1456.48] There is nothing and 
they say useless things.
[1460.48] Anyway, you leave all this,
[1462.84] you tell us a good proposal for our Ramsha.
[1466.04] Ramsha’s father wants that 
we marry her as soon as possible.
[1470.72] You know Ramsha’s father is not well.
[1474.28] He already had diabetes and 
now he also has a heart problem.
[1480.52] The sooner you fulfill the responsibility 
of a daughter, the better.
[1484.52] After all, you shouldn’t delay marrying off
your grown up child.
[1489.60] Look Mehnaz, I will not keep 
anything hidden.
[1493.60] We will surely have problems with regards
to Ramsha’s wedding.
[1497.40] Because where is doubt in the hearts 
of people with regards to the girl’s character,
[1502.48] there it is really difficult 
to find good proposals.
[1508.20] Anyway, you don’t worry.
[1511.36] If I see a good and suitable proposal,
[1514.20] I will surely tell you.
[1517.20] I have a proposal,
[1519.52] if you agree, then 
I will take things forward.
[1524.00] Yes, yes, why not? 
Do talk to them.
[1527.48] But be careful,
[1529.24] that the people should be simple 
and decent.
[1531.16] Look, I will tell you something,
[1533.84] the boy’s age is a little older, 
but he has a good job.
[1537.92] He is a supervisor in a garment factory.
[1541.28] Okay, how old is he?
[1544.88] He must be at least between 
forty five to fifty years of age.
[1553.00] But look, I will not lie at all.
[1555.76] He was married earlier, 
but he has divorced his wife.
[1561.88] Look, he even had two children,
[1563.68] but his wife took them with her.
[1566.88] Our Ramsha will have no issues.
[1570.48] Are you in your senses?
[1573.20] What are you saying?
[1575.04] You are suggesting a proposal for a 
forty five year old man, for my young daughter.
[1578.68] No, we don’t accept. You leave it.
[1581.40] If you have a good proposal as per 
her age, then please tell me.
[1585.96] Look Mehnaz, I am in no hurry,
[1588.12] you think and let me know. 
I will leave now. Goodbye.
[1634.20] Is this the same Ramsha, 
who wouldn’t stop laughing?
[1638.28] Whose laughter would echo in this home?
[1642.28] It is like she has forgotten to laugh now.
[1655.72] Ramsha.
[1658.24] Tea.
Thank you so much.
[1659.76] Thank you.
[1664.60] Are you feeling okay?
[1667.56] Yes. Why? What happened?
[1671.36] I am surprised.
[1672.60] Today you said thank you 
on giving you a cup of tea.
[1674.84] In all these years you didn’t thank me once.
[1677.76] How did you thank me today? 
You are being formal with me today?
[1682.16] I am not being formal, 
I am caring about it.
[1688.96] Even if late, but I have realized it.
[1692.88] Our real life is around our own.
[1700.88] The ones we ignore.
[1704.20] Really?
[1705.44] You have started to say such big things.
[1715.48] Annie.
[1718.68] What are you doing here?
[1720.84] Come on, go to your room and study.
[1724.04] Sure.
[1731.24] Stay away from my sister.
[1736.04] I am scared that she might become like you.
[1744.88] You are lying,
[1747.04] to yourself and me too.
[1749.56] You know well what you are afraid of.
[1753.24] You are afraid
[1754.64] that if I sit with Annie and 
I tell her your reality,
[1757.52] then she too will hate you 
like I hate you,
[1761.32] and she will never see 
your filthy face.
[1764.20] You are afraid of this, right?
[1812.48] Ramsha.
Yes, mama?
[1816.68] Talk to the boy you liked
[1823.16] and tell him to send his family 
for your proposal.
[1826.96] If we like his family,
[1829.96] then I promise you, your father 
will not have an objection.
[1832.84] Here you go.
[1834.28] Mama.
[1836.08] Mama, Afnan is really good
[1838.08] and his family is really good too.
[1840.44] His family business has a big name.
[1843.08] I am sure, papa would surely know them.
[1846.16] When you meet Afnan. 
You will be happy to meet him
[1850.12] That’s it.
[1852.04] How good they are or how bad they are,
[1854.44] me and your father will decide this.
[1858.40] You just call his family.
[1869.44] Oh God, thank you so much.
[1873.44] I didn’t even think you will ease it 
for me like this.
[1878.16] Thank you God
[1879.84] that You did something so big for me,
so easily.
[1883.72] God, thank you so much.
[1891.88] Hello.
[1893.36] Greetings Afnan. 
Where are you?
[1896.36] You know, there is something.
[1897.84] At times you ask questions, 
like a wife would question her husband.
[1903.72] I am going for a meeting. 
You tell me.
[1907.48] Arrange a meeting with me too.
[1911.12] I have to talk to you about 
something important
[1913.16] and one thing out of it 
is really important.
[1915.76] Yes, so tell me right now, 
I am listening.
[1918.76] No. No, Afnan, I cannot do it 
on the call like this.
[1923.64] I want to talk to you about it 
by meeting you.
[1925.64] Okay fine,
[1927.36] but I am a little busy nowadays,
[1929.44] so we will meet after two to three days.
[1932.88] Afnan, you don’t understand me.
[1934.64] I want to talk to you about 
something really important.
[1936.96] This thing is even more important 
than all your work.
[1939.28] You please meet me.
[1940.76] Okay, I will do something, okay?
[1944.44] Fine, I will wait for you.
[1947.44] Okay. Bye.
[1968.68] Annie, please, agree for the last time.
[1971.44] Now even mama has agreed.
[1972.72] Once I meet Afnan, after that mama 
will talk to papa and convince him.
[1975.88] Just support me one last time.
[1978.60] Then what is the issue? 
Call Afnan home.
[1981.76] Make him talk to elder mama
and elder papa.
[1983.68] Have you gone mad?
 Let me meet him myself first.
[1987.00] Once I meet him and talk to him, 
then only can I invite him over to the home.
[1990.40] By the way, tell me the truth, Ramsha,
[1992.28] does Afnan really love you?
[1995.88] Do you have a doubt?
[1998.68] All that he has done for me,
[2002.04] there is no room for doubt, Annie.
[2004.28] Yes, that is true.
[2007.00] You know what love is?
[2011.88] Giving respect to the person you like.
[2014.80] Giving them respect, supporting them,
[2018.00] listening to them.
[2021.36] I have learned all this from Afnan.
[2025.24] When I was helpless in that city,
[2030.12] I was completely alone,
[2032.68] I had no one with me,
[2036.04] that’s when he had come,
[2038.32] he had supported me.
[2043.28] And you know,
[2045.56] I was not ready to come home.
[2047.44] I was really scared. I didn’t want 
to come home.
[2050.84] But he made me understand, 
he gave me the courage.
[2054.28] He made me understand and 
sent me back,
[2058.56] or else maybe I would have been 
going around aimlessly till today.
[2064.24] He was worried for me.
[2066.24] I wish you could have seen
[2068.24] with how much love and sincerity 
he was making me understand.
[2072.68] If you could see him,
[2074.80] then you would have realized 
how much he loves me.
[2077.96] You show so much acceptance 
only to the one
[2081.68] who you truly love, someone 
who is the most special for you.
[2087.80] Please Annie, support me once.
[2090.48] Let me meet him once.
[2094.08] Think about it, you won’t get a better 
brother in law than him.
[2097.16] And whatever money you ask for, 
for the shoe hiding custom,
[2099.92] I will get him to pay it to you. 
For sure.
[2102.16] For sure?
For sure.
[2106.24] You won’t learn.
[2108.40] Thank you so much.
[2111.24] You are my best sister.
[2113.88] You too.
[2126.08] Annie,
[2128.72] my heart is beating really fast.
[2131.60] I don’t understand how will I express 
my love to Afnan.
[2137.16] See, my hands are already cold.
[2140.24] Hey, when he loves you,
[2143.16] then what is the reason to be tense?
[2145.64] I am not tense. 
My heart is really worried.
[2149.88] I don’t know what will happen.
[2151.88] You know I feel really shy.
[2153.84] How will I say this to him?
[2156.40] I should have told him on the call.
[2160.16] I asked him to meet me for no reason.
[2165.36] You tell me, what should I do?
[2171.72] Annie, what are you looking at?
[2175.68] I am seeing the colours of happiness come
and go on your face.
[2180.00] I want that God always 
keep you happy like this.
[2185.36] Ameen.
[2186.80] Ameen.
[2189.72] You know,
[2191.08] what is the best thing about Afnan?
[2193.20] He is really caring.
[2194.96] He is really loving. 
And you know,
[2197.20] he gives so much respect, 
he talks with so much love,
[2200.20] with so much respect.
[2201.36] You know when I was in Islamabad,
when I was all alone,
[2204.20] when you people were not with me,
then Afnan helped me the most, he…
