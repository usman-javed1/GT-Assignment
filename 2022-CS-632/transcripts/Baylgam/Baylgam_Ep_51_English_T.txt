[23.24] Salma. Hey, Salma.
[26.72] What happened?
How did you come so soon?
[28.84] Hey, the news is such,
[30.56] I had to come early.
[32.08] Madam Afsheen called.
[35.64] She called?
[37.44] Oh, that’s it,
[39.00] she said no, right?
[47.96] I knew it earlier they would say no.
[50.32] Now you got a call.
[51.24] You had tied hopes for no reason.
[54.56] Annie, child,
[55.96] do you know your mother’s
biggest problem?
[63.56] She talks more,
[65.04] thinks less,
[66.16] and she doesn’t listen at all.
[78.36] Refusal is out of question,
[81.00] she has agreed.
[95.40] She said to me that
[96.36] you fix the wedding date, that’s it.
[98.92] I have decided,
[100.28] I will talk to madam Afsheen
[101.96] and decide on the
wedding date soon.
[104.36] Really?
[106.96] You do one thing,
[108.36] call Shani
[109.48] and tell him to bring
sweets on his way back.
[111.36] We will go their place
right now with sweets.
[113.52] Papa is happy like
he won a lottery.
[119.32] Hey, child,
[120.88] my niece is no less than
a lottery for me
[132.72] And you should be happy,
[133.96] your friend is coming back.
[140.28] Chat with her, talk to her,
have fun.
[148.16] Yes, I am really happy. Mama,
[150.16] after Ramsha left,
I have nothing to do at home.
[154.32] I get so bored.
[155.76] Papa, if you are going right now,
[157.48] then I too will come along
with the sweets.
[159.24] Hey, why not child?
[160.40] It is your only brother’s wedding.
[162.08] It is your right, do come along.
[165.24] Hey, how are you planning
things yourself?
[168.20] Ramsha didn’t agree to
the marriage earlier,
[170.56] how did she agree now?
[172.72] Earlier it was different,
[175.04] she had the support
of sister in law.
[178.20] Now she is alone.
[191.96] Everyone must have
made her understand,
[193.96] talked sense into her.
[195.68] Thank God,
[197.52] she came to her senses.
[200.00] You leave everything,
[201.28] bring her phone.
[202.00] My damned phone is not charged.
[204.80] I will call Shani.
[206.00] Bring the phone.
[206.72] Bring your mother’s phone.
[208.72] What are you cooking?
[210.24] I am making vegetables.
[211.60] Hey, today is a day to be happy,
[213.84] add meat to it today.
[220.04] Yes, yes, you people are right.
[222.36] I would say,
[223.44] why delay something good?
[225.48] And actually, Ramsha’s parents’ home,
and in-laws is your home.
[239.76] We just have to perform the ceremony
of sending her off from here.
[243.28] What are you saying, Afsheen?
[250.36] I didn’t just call
Ramsha my daughter,
[252.44] I also considered her
my daughter.
[266.48] The same way a daughter has
a relation with her parents’ home,
[269.56] the same way, she too has
a relation with this home.
[285.32] She can come and go here,
whenever she wants.
[298.24] I made God my witness
[302.48] and called sister Mehnaz, my sister.
[315.28] She is my niece with that relation,
[316.92] so just like it is Alizay’s
uncle’s home,
[318.92] this is Ramsha’s home.
[320.96] Wow.
[323.52] Yes, yes, absolutely. Brother
you are absolutely right.
[326.80] I also meant that.
[329.60] Brother Qasim, this is your
affection and love that
[334.88] you are giving so much respect
to relations made in name
[349.76] or else nowadays people
don’t care about their blood relation,
[354.60] they don’t respect them at all.
[360.28] I would suggest that
[361.60] now that we are sitting together,
[362.84] we should also finalize
the wedding date.
[376.12] Because brother is really
busy because of his business,
[379.68] I don’t know when we will be
able to sit together like this.
[386.56] Yes, yes, why not.
[388.20] Believe me, you snatched
the words from my mouth.
[404.80] As you see fit, decide,
[408.84] and let us know the date,
that’s it.
[424.88] Mama, papa,
[426.92] if you people are talking
[428.28] then can I go meet Ramsha?
[430.32] Yes, yes, do go, she is upstairs.
[434.48] I have to make a phone call,
[437.08] excuse me.
[438.28] You people, please
have something.
[466.16] I am searching for that hero,
[468.16] maybe I find his Facebook
account by luck.
[470.52] Whose?
[472.24] Hey, the same
[473.28] with whom with whose car
I had made a Tik Tok.
[475.92] Him?
[478.48] Yes
[488.00] Annie.
[491.12] What?
[492.68] Annie.
[493.92] Annie, I am really happy.
[496.12] What happened?
[497.80] Annie, I am in love.
[499.76] I am in love with Afnan at first sight.
[502.84] He is so good, so good,
[504.92] hat what do I tell you?
[506.56] When I saw him,
[508.12] he was looking so handsome,
[510.28] so good,
[511.96] he had such amazing dressing,
[513.08] what do I tell you?
[516.32] What did Hania say and go?
[518.68] What fiancé?
[519.88] Oh fiancé.
[522.48] Hani was with me in
the mall yesterday.
[526.04] I met Afnan yesterday.
[529.60] I didn’t understand what
to say to her, so
[531.72] I told her that he is my fiancé.
[534.60] By the way, what is wrong in this?
I am right.
[537.76] What did you talk to Afnan about?
[539.20] My heart is worried.
[540.32] I am getting wrong doubts.
[544.56] Your doubts are absolutely
right, Annie.
[548.44] I didn’t find Afnan.
[550.16] What do you mean you didn’t find him?
[552.92] He didn’t come to meet you?
[561.12] But called him a day in advance.
[566.28] You people had decided a time.
[568.04] Then what happened?
[570.00] Maybe there was
a misunderstanding,
[577.32] and this misunderstanding
took me to him
[584.00] and I didn’t find him.
[597.16] Afnan is Mr. Qasim’s son?
[601.32] This Afnan is the same?
[604.92] I don’t believe it.
[607.16] Yes, Annie.
[610.96] See, where destiny has brought me.
[619.24] This is the same sight
I wanted to run far away from.
[623.76] See where fate has
made me stand today.
[630.96] How can you marry anyone,
Ramsha?
[635.00] You used to love him, right?
[639.08] Afnan is married, Annie.
[644.08] Afnan is married?
[647.00] Yes.
[648.68] To whom?
[650.88] To Alizay.
[660.76] Maybe you would have seen her.
[663.04] Mr. Qasim’s daughter in law,
[664.60] she is Afnan’s wife.
[673.12] When a person’s heart breaks,
[675.60] then he doesn’t stay like before.
[677.84] Boys are like that,
[679.20] I don’t know why girls
don’t understand this.
[684.16] Ramsha really trusted Afnan.
[688.36] First that Afnan left her,
[690.16] then elder mama left the world.
[694.16] Now, she has lost trust in people,
[698.76] that is why she doesn’t
agree to getting married.
[704.40] Afnan?
[706.84] Yes. Afnan.
[710.68] Ramsha loved Afnan a lot,
[713.56] she also wanted to marry him.
[719.56] But her destiny didn’t have
Afnan’s companionship.
[739.20] I made a big mistake, Ramsha.
[741.76] What mistake?
[753.04] Tabassum.
[754.00] Yes, sir?
[754.48] What happened? Have
some guests come over?
[756.04] Yes, sir, madam Ramsha’s
in-laws are here.
[759.72] Ramsha’s in-laws?
[761.84] Who are Ramsha’s in-laws?
[764.16] Madam Afsheen told
me to make tea,
[766.32] madam Ramsha’s in-laws
are here.
[769.40] Fine, you go.
[774.96] Who can be Ramsha’s in-laws?
[777.76] I just quit having sweets
three days ago.
[785.08] Come, Mr. Afnan. Come.
[787.36] What happened? All okay?
[794.60] Give sweets to Mr. Afnan as well.
[805.36] Sweets? But for what?
[808.00] We have fixed the wedding
[821.28] for Shani and Ramsha.
[822.84] Congratulations to you too.
[846.16] Come son, have some sweets.
[851.72] No, thank you so much.
[870.88] Actually, the children of our home
don’t compromise on anything,
[876.28] and Afnan is mostly on a diet.
[878.12] He doesn’t have these sweets.
[886.52] I hope you people didn’t mind.
[888.92] No, no,
[890.56] what is there to mind in this?
[893.32] Every home has their principles,
[896.52] they own ways.
[898.76] We didn’t mind it at all.
[915.60] Ramsha, had
I even known a little,
[920.36] I wouldn’t have told her
anything about you and Afnan.
[929.32] I made a big mistake,
[931.20] forgive me.
[932.60] Annie, don’t apologize.
[940.96] What had to happen,
has happened.
[943.40] I have no complaints from you.
[953.32] All this was written in my fate.
[964.08] Why are you looking
at me like that?
[968.08] I am just seeing that
[970.04] the girl who would make
noise on small things,
[973.56] she has so much
patience now.
[978.04] I have made my life easy
learning the religion.
[987.60] Maybe this is why I am
so satisfied today.
[997.60] You know Annie,
[999.28] I have learned one thing.
[1007.04] If we cry on everything,
[1008.80] if we get worried,
[1010.72] then this doesn’t make a difference.
[1019.20] It is better that we learn to
be patient on our worries.
[1030.88] And we ask God.
[1033.60] Then He will make everything
easy for us.
[1044.24] You know,
[1045.72] since I have started following religion,
[1047.80] my life has become really easy, Annie
[1056.52] or else, the path I was on,
[1060.00] I would have ruined myself.
[1066.00] God has specially blessed me.
[1069.16] Ramsha, I don’t believe it,
that you are saying all this.
[1081.80] Tell me, the truth Ramsha,
[1083.72] are you happy marrying
brother Shani?
[1106.72] Why?
[1108.44] Are you not happy that
[1109.60] I will come to that home
as your sister in law?
[1117.16] Huh?
[1118.44] I am completely sure that
[1119.72] uncle and aunt would have started
shopping for me as well.
[1130.44] Right?
[1135.20] Annie, do you know,
[1136.16] aunt Afsheen got some
clothes for me.
[1138.40] You sit, I will show them to you.
[1188.56] Excuse me. You?
[1193.88] Maybe you didn’t recognize me,
[1195.48] I am Ramsha’s cousin, Annie.
[1197.68] Oh yes, greetings. How are you?
[1201.52] You know, I am disappointed to see you.
[1209.08] In fact, I am more sorry
than disappointed.
[1217.48] You didn’t care for my sister.
[1225.28] Ramsha loved you so much,
[1228.48] she was so sincere with you.
[1240.08] You didn’t believe her.
[1242.72] I know,
[1243.76] she was idiotic,
I know she was emotional,
[1246.68] but she was crazy after you.
[1261.72] Earning money through showbiz,
[1265.56] being famous was her passion,
[1269.64] but you were more than passion for her.
[1279.16] Mr. Afnan,
[1280.76] every girl who lives for her desires,
[1283.32] who wants to breathe in
open air is not a loafer.
[1297.64] Such girls just follow wrong
advice of people,
[1300.84] but believe me,
[1302.60] them returning is not impossible.
[1313.24] But, us?
[1316.08] We don’t leave the door
for them to come back.
[1319.52] We don’t give them the
chance to come back.
[1332.40] And you did the same.
[1335.16] You did the same with Ramsha.
[1345.88] You didn’t understand Ramsha.
[1425.04] What is the matter?
[1431.48] Do you want to say something?
[1433.92] Yes.
[1437.04] What do you want me to get?
[1438.60] I am going to the shop right now.
[1441.40] Tell me, I will bring it. In fact,
[1442.72] write it on a paper,
[1444.52] I will bring it. Come on.
[1450.08] I don’t want you to
bring something.
[1452.72] Then?
[1455.20] You will be marrying Ramsha
in a few days, right?
[1466.92] She is a really good girl.
[1468.76] Her behavior with
everyone is really good.
[1475.84] I want you take care of her.
[1483.40] So what do you think?
[1484.96] I will not take care of her?
[1488.20] There is nothing like that.
[1494.68] You are a little strict,
[1497.20] that is why I said it.
[1499.32] Okay,
[1500.96] so you are worried for your friend, more than your brother.
[1504.52] No brother, nothing like that.
[1506.64] I worry for both of you.
[1513.40] I want that
[1514.32] both of you stay happy.
[1516.20] I just said it.
[1520.60] You are my younger sister,
stay like a younger sister.
[1527.96] Mind your own business,
understand?
[1530.36] And prepare for yourself.
[1533.08] How do I have to keep Ramsha,
[1535.40] where do I have to keep her,
[1542.48] that is my matter
[1543.76] and I know well what I have to do.
[1551.40] No need to act like my mother.
[1555.28] I just said it.
[1560.00] Come on, leave from here.
Come on.
[1569.72] Wait.
[1573.60] Hear me out clearly.
[1582.56] In future, when Ramsha
comes to this home,
[1585.48] then stay away from her,
and mind your own business.
[1593.56] And it would be better that
you stay quiet in our matters.
[1598.44] Do you understand?
[1648.00] What is all this?
[1650.68] Ramsha’s aunt came,
[1652.56] she brought her wedding gifts.
[1655.52] Did you people call me?
[1657.72] Yes, your aunt brought
wedding gifts for you.
[1675.32] And she has said that
[1676.28] she will send the dresses for
the wedding and reception later.
[1678.72] So you have a look.
[1691.64] Oh please, mama.
[1693.28] What is there to see in this?
[1707.52] Is this the wedding gift that came?
[1708.64] Is this how a wedding gift is?
[1710.20] Do you remember, Afnan had
got my wedding gift prepared?
[1723.68] He got every single thing
made for my by his choice.
[1740.80] Do you remember?
[1741.64] All my friends were saying that
[1743.44] Afnan looks so happy on my wedding.
[1751.84] He got a lot of my things from Europe.
[1762.16] And why would he not have gotten it?
[1764.16] I am his love and choice, both.
[1767.84] Obviously, your wedding
gift was really beautiful.
[1770.64] Who didn’t praise it?
[1777.64] Now Ramsha’s family, obviously,
[1780.68] sent things as per their worth.
[1789.08] How can you compare this wedding gift,
with your wedding gift?
[1793.84] Hmm
[1795.08] Everything is really good.
[1810.76] And no matter how expensive
or precious things are,
[1813.48] they become useless after use.
[1832.76] I will send Tabassum,
[1833.80] she will gather all the things.
