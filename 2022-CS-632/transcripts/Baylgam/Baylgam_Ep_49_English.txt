Who do you trust the most 
in the whole world. of course, Afnan. What happened? 
Why are you laughing? He is my husband, off course, if I won’t trust him 
who else will I trust? A person should trust their life partner. Yes, but I would never marry a girl who already has an affair and would be continuing 
after marriage too. What are you trying to say? Please don’t riddle with me. I just have one answer to 
all these riddles. Ramsha. Ramsha used to trust Afnan a lot. First Afnan left her 
then aunt left the world, now she has lost trust in people which is why she is not ready to marry. Afnan? Hmm, Afnan. Ramsha used to love Afnan a lot, she even wanted to marry him but she didn’t have the companionship 
of Afnan in her fate. Ramsha? What are you still doing in this house? Didn’t Uncle ask you to leave? And where are you going by the way. Okay, so you are using Academy as an excuse 
to go meet Afnan, right? You guys have secretly planned to meet 
and hid it from me. There is nothing like that Alizeh, 
I am not going to meet Afnan. I am going to the academy
 with the driver. Don’t lie to me. Afnan has just left for office a while ago and now you are going after him, both of you cannot meet in front of me so you guys have planned to meet 
behind my back, right? I don’t have any answer to all this
 that you are saying, Alizeh. I am getting late, I am going 
to the academy. Agree or don’t, she is definitely 
going to meet Afnan, I won’t spare Afnan today 
if she goes to him. Look, this project is very important for us, that is why, the more work that is done 
on its presentation, it will be better. I want that our company gets 
this contract very soon and if that doesn’t happen, 
it will be a failure on our part so please make sure that. Where is Ramsha, Afnan? Umm, I… Where did you hide Ramsha? 
Where is she? Alizeh? Alizeh, 
what has happened to you? Everyone is watching, 
what are you saying? Afnan, don’t lie to me, 
where is Ramsha? Umm, excuse me, guys, we will resume this meeting
later on, okay? Afnan, I am asking you something. 
Ssshhh. Where have you hide Ramsha? What is wrong with you? 
Have you gone insane? She has come to meet you here, right? Why would Ramsha come to meet me?
 What is wrong with you? Do you even know what did you do 
in front of everyone? What were you showing everyone? You were making a joke out of
 both of us, Alizeh, you… are you in your senses? So then where did she go? Has she gone to the Academy? I don’t know where she is 
but she is not here, you saw it that I was in a meeting 
when you came in but do you realize what you have 
done after coming here. if not about me, at least be careful 
of my position, what was the need of creating 
this scene here? Afnan, I am going to get crazy like this. I will get crazy, Afnan, I feel very insecure. Okay, come here. 
How should I make you… Okay, sit, sit.
How should I make you understand? Please, please, please, 
nothing has happened. Nothing has happened. What will I do if Ramsha 
steals you from me? Nothing like that would happen, 
Please Alizeh listen to me. I know that you are feeling insecure 
regarding Ramsha, but I just want to clear you that we were just friends for the time being 
and we are not anymore, it does not exist at all. Afnan, I cannot share you with anyone, 
you know that right? And that Ramsha wants to take you
away from me, I know that, I know that very well. You won’t leave me, right, Afnan please. Please don’t leave me I cannot live 
with you. I will go mad, I am telling you. Yes, yes Alizeh, 
I know you love me a lot but trust me, I love you a lot too, I cannot even think of anyone except you and I promise you I will never leave you, please take out this fear from your heart. There is nothing between I and Ramsha,
 nothing at all, I am just yours, just yours, Alizeh. Promise me that you won’t leave me. Never ever, never ever. Please relax. Ramsha, my child, your patience has increased your 
respect and ranks in my heart. Indeed, God is with those who are patient, may God grant you the best reward 
for this patience. Amen. Uncle? Yes, my child? May I ask you something? Sure, ask? Is it true that you will let me 
out of this house? Look, my child, I promised 
your late mother, sister Mehnaz, May God forgive her, 
that you are my responsibility and I wanted you to live in this house and wanted to marry you from 
this house like my daughter but I guess fate has other plans. I feel it’s better for this home 
if you leave from here. Now look, Alizeh’s condition is in front of you, I have never seen her yelling 
and crying like this in her life, Afsheen is also very worried 
because of her. Ramsha, like you are my responsibility, my sister and my niece are 
my responsibility too, are you understanding? I understand all your problems. I will accept whatever decision you make. stay blessed. yes, yes, no problem, just let me know the time I will be there. Mom? what am I hearing? Uncle is sending Ramsha to the hostel? I will call you back. Okay, bye. What is your problem? You wanted the same that 
Ramsha leaves this house. Mom, by sending Ramsha out of 
this house I meant that no person from this house should 
stay in contact with her, if uncle sends her to the hostel, Afnan and her way of meeting will
become very easy. What do you mean? It’s pretty clear mom, right now she is in this house 
so she is in front of my eyes, I know if they are meeting or 
not or doing what, they will get a chance behind my back. Why do none of you understand? I want Afnan to get rid of that girl. You are right, give me some time, 
and I will do something. How many sacks of sugar are done? 6 are done. Okay. Greetings. Yes, yes, I will just be there, I will be there. Listen? yes sir? 
Take care I will be back. Okay brother. Greetings. Greetings. You are brother Qasim’s sister, right? Yes, yes. I wanted to talk to you about 
something important, will you join me in the car, I don’t feel it’s appropriate to talk here. Okay, okay, I will. Umm, brother has made Ramsha his daughter. By the grace of God, by the grace of God. And you know that daughters cannot be married 
empty handed. Indeed, indeed. What do they say? Hint is enough for an intelligent person and you seem to be quite intelligent
to me by face. Thank you. You are Ramsha’s uncle and who can have more right 
on Ramsha than you? yes. Mom? Mom? Yes, why are you making 
so much noise? What is it? Dad called, he was saying that 
Mr. Qasim’s sister is coming so clean the drawing room. Mr. Qasim’s sister? 
Why is she coming? Dad didn’t tell that. First his niece came now his sister. Dad was saying that send brother 
to get refreshment and I will clean the drawing meanwhile, you can call brother, okay? First his niece came now his sister, there is definitely something, they cannot come without a purpose, there must be some purpose. Dad, when I was telling you 
to send Ramsha to the hostel, you didn’t listen to me, now you are sending her 
to the hostel yourself, please don’t do that. Things were different back then, now situation is different. Dad if you think asking Ramsha to leave
 this house is the solution of the problem, then your thinking is wrong. You should make Alizeh understand that she should control her anger, 
we can control this situation, dad. I have taken this decision 
after a lot of thinking. Mr. Ahmed’s wife runs that hostel, she is a nice mature woman, I am satisfied and I trust her, you don’t have to worry at all. How should I not worry, dad? Ramsha feels so secure here, do you think if she leaves this place 
and goes to the hostel, will she feel the same amount of safety? And when she will be under the pressure that she has no one familiar around her, 
her studies will be affected too. I have made the decision, Afnan. Your decision is wrong, Dad. Okay, look into your own collar, I wish you would have realized 
your mistakes so we wouldn’t have come 
to this situation. It is better that you leave 
my decisions to me. You haven’t left me capable 
to face my sister and niece. Today the strict decisions that 
I have to take, I never wanted to do them and you have forced me so I have decided that Ramsha will no longer live
in this house now. When I am the one at fault then you cannot punish Ramsha for my mistake by putting her 
through this and just imagine where will 
the poor girl go from here? Her own home is not safe for her. I have said that Ramsha won’t 
live here anymore. Yes Dad but I am telling you 
that if you just once… I won’t listen to you anymore now, Afnan. I have told you that Ramsha 
won’t live here now, so, she won’t. It is better if we don’t talk 
about this anymore. Leave for now. Mom, why are you worried since so long? You have been so worried ever 
since Mr. Qasim’s sister left, after all why did she come? 
What did she say? She wants me and your dad to go to Mr. Qasim’s house for 
Ramsha’s marriage proposal. That is what she was here to say? Yes. Didn’t you tell her that Ramsha would
never marry brother? She doesn’t like brother at all, if she would, she would have 
never left this house. This is the problem, I openly told everything to her but she is still persistent that we should come there with 
Ramsha’s proposal once. Dad must have given them 
piece of their mind. That is what I am surprised about that your dad didn’t say anything to him in fact ensured them that we will definitely go with Ramsha’s 
proposal to Mr. Qasim’s house. What? I don’t know what he wants, 
I don’t understand, he agreed to it only when Mr. Qasim’s sister 
asked him once, there is definitely something fishy. Mom, dad might have had some mercy 
for Ramsha after sister in law’s death and he might have become 
sincere with her. No, if your dad was that sincere with Ramsha, then sister-in-law and Ramsha 
wouldn’t have left this house, I am very well aware of your Dad. There is definitely something. Madam Ramsha, do you need me 
to do anything else? No nothing, that’s it, 
thank you, you may go. Come in. What is going on?
What are you doing? Preparations to leave this house. You are not going to do anything like this.
You are not going anywhere. I have to leave this house one day, Afnan, and the kind of the ongoing situation 
in the house, it is better if I leave on my own, else I will be kicked out from here. I am telling you to leave this, 
you are not going anywhere. What is wrong with you? What do you think that whatever you say and whatever
you think will be right? What happens by you saying 
anything, Afnan? What is my relationship with you 
that you are giving me orders? Look, the reason why you are leaving
 this house, is of no use, if you think it will make any difference 
to Alizeh if you leave, nothing will fix or get right. I know that, I know that it wouldn’t make difference 
to anyone if I leave, nothing will get fixed but I still have 
to leave from here Afnan. Ramsha, why don’t you understand? Why don’t you understand Afnan? Today, because of me, because of me you stood in front of uncle. You have caused so much pain 
and hurt to uncle. You have never done any favor 
on me Afnan, but uncle has done a lot of favors on me, and I will never tolerate that 
someone speaks against the one who did me favor,
 or hurt him. Okay, I know, I know I shouldn’t have spoken to Dad
like this but I got angry because he wasn’t understanding 
what I was saying or I guess I wasn’t able to explain 
my point of view to him. But you relax, this matter is between myself and Dad, I will make him understand, 
and he will agree but you don’t need to go anywhere. I am telling you that 
you cannot go anywhere. what are you doing, Afnan? What do you think of me? What do you think? What do you think that whatever 
you are thinking and saying is all right? Why don’t you understand? I cannot trust anyone 
when it comes to you. Since when did I become so important? It is not about being important or not, the thing is that I don’t want you
to go away from here, this place is very safe for you, 
you are safe here, and don’t worry about Alizeh, 
I will make her understand, I am telling you trust me. What do you think? What do you think that you will take
all my life decisions and I will agree to them? You have always listened to me, Ramsha. That is the reason 
why I am suffering today. I agree that some of my decisions
have brought you to this point but I can only regret that I wish I had understood you 
at that time. I cannot see anything bad happening 
to you Ramsha, trust me. I trusted you once before as well, what happened then? Mr. Faisal? Umm, why is he calling at this time? I am sure there must be 
something important, I don’t know where has Afnan gone. Afnan? Why did Afnan go up? I am sure he has met Ramsha. Why don’t you understand? I cannot trust anyone 
when it comes to you. since when did I become so important? It is not about being important or not, the thing is that I don’t want you to go away from here, this place is very safe for you, 
you are safe here, you shouldn’t go to your home, 
you know that and I know that too, and don’t worry about Alizeh, I will make her understand, 
I am telling you trust me. What do you think? What do you think that 
you will take all my life decisions and I will agree to them? You have always listened to me,
Ramsha. That is the reason 
why I am suffering today. I agree that some of my decisions 
have brought you to this point but I can only regret that I wish I had understood 
you at that time. I cannot see anything bad happening 
to you Ramsha, trust me. I trusted you once before as well, what happened then? What happened Afnan? Aren’t you sleepy? You care so much about Ramsha
that you have lost your sleep? Yes, I am concerned for Ramsha.
