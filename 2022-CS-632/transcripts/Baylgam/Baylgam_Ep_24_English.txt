Ramsha, I have packed all 
your things in this. If you want me to keep anything else 
then tell me. I am asking you Ramsha. Ramsha. 
Yes? I am asking you Ramsha. 
What happened, Annie? I think you have no interest 
in your wedding, Ramsha. Ramsha, forget Afnan. Take him out of your heart. I have distanced myself as much as 
I could Annie. But there are some things
 that are not in our control. Your heart, your thinking is not in your control. If it was, then we would always remember things 
that would bring us happiness. We would never have tears in our eyes. But this doesn’t happen. This doesn’t happen. You are absolutely right. A person only has their actions 
in their control, but not their thinking. Annie, you just pray that after marriage, I am able
to keep Nabeel happy. I am able to live a peaceful right, so that he stays happy and so do I. My prayers are always with you. Did you bring me here? No, no, I came to visit you. Of course, I brought you. And if I had not come there, then do you know what would have 
happened with you? You were unconscious and your friend had left you alone 
and went. What? Why are you laughing now? I am thinking. Whenever I have called you in trouble, 
you come. The problem is you get caught 
in a lot of troubles. I don’t know what they would have 
done to me. They were going to do something 
bad with me. Ramsha, how could I not come? It was you, I had to come for you at all cost. And I know well, 
you have not done anything, you are being framed in this matter. But I am with you, Ramsha. I will not leave you alone 
in this difficult time. And we will get through this. Come on, sit in the car, 
eat something too. Ramsha. Hey, child, you two have packed all the things, right? Yes, elder mama, 
I have packed all the things. You tell elder papa to take out the car, 
I will go get ready and come. Fine, child. Okay, you too child, 
check on all the things, okay? Mama, you keep this. Now I don’t need this. Whenever I want to talk to you 
I will do it from Nabeel’s number. What happened? Give me whatever you have quickly. Give it quickly. Give it quickly. What do you want?
Give whatever is kept. Give it quickly. Man this… Give it quickly. I don’t have time. Be quick. Be quick. 
Listen to me. Come on. Come on. 
Come on. It was five hundred thousand rupees. Brother, I left the bank and two boys 
suddenly came from somewhere and snatched it. I have told you so many times, we have to be very careful in bringing
and taking money. Brother, I was really careful. You believe me, 
I didn’t even take a bag, so that no one has a doubt that 
I have such a big sum of money. I feel someone has spied on me. How would anyone know 
I have so much cash? These thieves and robbers know 
everything my brother. Now what do we do? I have to make the payment 
for the hall and food. Hey, what do you mean 
what will you have to do? Take a loan from someone. That’s why I used to tell you 
to have some arrangement. We will have to do something now. I made a mistake, 
I should have done this. Brother, if you agree to me, then try talking to Mr. Qasim. How can I talk to Mr. Qasim? Is he our relative that he will stand for us. No, it doesn’t sound reasonable. Brother, Mr. Qasim is a good hearted man, and he is also wealthy. Did you not see how he helps people? Some times, if your own don’t come to help, then strangers help you. You try to talk to Mr. Qasim 
on my insistence once. He is right. My God, Alizay. Alizay. Alizay, wake up. You are alive right? Alizay, get up, Sunday doesn’t mean 
that a person sleeps all day long. Afnan, you are the enemy of my sleep. Do a job then you will know. Alizay, Sunday doesn’t mean 
that you sleep till night. Look at the time, it is almost night. 
Get up come on. Let me sleep for ten more minutes please,
 Afnan. There is no need. Leave it. Leave it.
That’s it, get up. It is enough. You are really bad. Give it to me. I am very bad, thank you so much. Get up, man, 
what is wrong? Okay, tell me, what is for lunch? Hey it is not lunch time it is dinner time and why do you care what is cooked? We are going out for dinner. 
So just get ready. Okay, go make me a good cup of coffee. First ask me with love, then I will make it. Afnan, please make coffee for me. What? I didn’t hear it. Please, say it again. Afnan, please make coffee for me. If you say it with so much love, then why coffee, I will give my life. What do I ask you for something 
that is already mine? Are you sure? Go make me coffee. 
Okay fine. But. But don’t sleep. 
Should I give you the pillow? Yes. 
No. Here. Here. I will bring it. Don’t sleep. 
Yes, fine, okay. Brother, what is the update? 
What did Mr. Qasim say? Thank God, the issue is solved, Anwar. Brother Qasim was not in the city, he said he is sending his son
 with the money. He is a really good man. Brother… He helped us in this difficulty
 being a stranger. May God keep him happy. My heart said he would be of 
use for us. Okay, let me try calling Mr. Iqbal. 
It is really late. Did they leave home or not? Although I told him to come on time. I will just call. 
Hey, listen… Hello. Hey, you told me even before I asked you. Yes, yes, we are waiting for you, come. Come on. Goodbye. Yes, yes, dad. Yes, I am leaving in a bit. Yes, yes, you don’t worry. I will do everything with responsibility. I will go there and make him talk to you. Yes, dad, I will reach in an hour. Yes. Take care. Goodbye. Shall we go, Afnan? By the way, where are we going for dinner? Alizay is it possible that we postpone 
our dinner for tomorrow? There is an emergency. What is this, Afnan? You woke me from my sleep and I got ready so quickly for you, and now you are saying 
we don’t have to go for dinner. Hey…
This is not right. Look if you don’t go for dinner 
with me today, then I will not go for dinner with you again. And what is so important that 
you are postponing our dinner for it. Hey, if you be quiet, then I will tell you. Dad’s friend’s daughter is 
getting married today. Today is the wedding, they need money. So, dad has put the responsibility on me 
to drop the money. Yes, so we will go for dinner, 
from there we will see. What will we, Alizay? What Afnan? Okay fine, first I will feed you. 
Come on. If you bother me… Man, I didn’t understand one thing. You used to say I will get married late, in fact, I will not get married 
in the next two years. Then what is this suddenly? Man, mama was hasty, so I said… Leave it. Leave it. Your happiness is telling me how much 
you wanted to get married. Hey, why do you bother my son? 
What is wrong? Aunt, he is my only cousin and then he is also my best friend, if I don’t bother him, who will I bother? That is true. But honestly son, Nabeel really wasn’t ready to get married, he was asking me a lot of time 
to set up his business. Did you hear that? But the girl’s family had put so much
pressure for the marriage, that we have to get the marriage done soon. Thank God he too agreed, or else I wouldn’t have got my hands
on this for two to four years. Call Mehnaz, so that we can start the wedding 
and also bring the bride. Yes, I was coming to ask you when you want to get the wedding done?
We will bring the bride. Yes, yes, I think it is time.
Call the molvi for the wedding. Yes, yes. Ask Fahad. 
Speak up Fahad. Fahad will tell you. 
Fahad will tell you. Fahad is my best friend. 
And you know what Fahad’s quality is? He never lies. He always speaks the truth, right Fahad? Fahad, this is Ramsha, and it is Ramsha’s birthday today. Happy birthday Ramsha. Look, I have told you honestly 
whatever I knew about this girl. Such a girl has a relation with a lot of men. If you take my advice, then you still have time. Save yourself. Fahad, what are you saying? Aunt Parveen has fixed the proposal, and she knows their whole family. I am sure you have a misunderstanding. Hey, I have no misunderstanding. All of these people are fooling you. And you must have heard the idiom, no matter how the lover is, but the bride should be of a good character, and this girl is worth making a lover, and not a wife. Fahad, I don’t believe it. Look, mama has done proper investigation and everything is done. I am getting married and you are saying 
the girl is not right. You don’t believe me, right? Look at this. Sister Fareeda Please call the groom, 
we are getting late. Yes, sure! I don’t know what Fahad has taken 
Nabeel to talk about. I will go call them myself, 
and they can talk later. I will call them. Nabeel, son, come on, everyone is waiting for you there. What has happened? What would have happened, Annie? Nothing, maybe he wanted to talk about 
something to his mother. Don’t worry, he must be coming. Sister in law. 
Yes? First the groom went his cousin and now his mother went too. 
Did something happen? No Salma, it is possible they went to talk 
amongst themselves. Wait a little, they will come. No sister in law, you go and find out, we are getting late for the wedding. Salma, it doesn’t seem right, they must have gone to talk 
about something personal. Maybe they are discussing something. Wait a while, we will see, then. Brother Iqbal is all okay? Yes, yes, all is okay. I don’t know what Farida is talking 
to Nabeel and Fahad about. Don’t worry, I will bring them. Yes, yes, actually, they are waiting 
for the wedding. Yes. What is the matter, son? 
Is everything okay? Mr. Sajid, call the groom for the wedding soon, delaying it for long is not good. I have to lead a wedding 
somewhere else too. Yes, they will just come. Molvi sahib, you start the wedding, the groom is here. 
This wedding cannot happen. Hey, but why? Did you find us people to lie to 
and deceive? What are you saying? I am right. Hey, you people looked like a good family
and simple people, and this is what you are up to? You had found my son for your daughter 
who had run away? You people must have thought
they are decent and simple people, let’s trap them. Right? Thank God Fahad told us about 
all your daughter’s actions. If Fahad was not there, then we would have been 
caught in your trap. Ask Fahad. Speak up Fahad. Fahad will tell you. 
Fahad will tell you. Fahad is my best friend. And you know what Fahad’s quality is? He never lies. 
He always speaks the truth, right Fahad? Fahad, this is Ramsha. You have some misunderstanding. Whatever it is, we will sit in the corner 
and talk, please. Look, the guests and 
everyone is listening. Hey, my child had made a mistake
in her naivety, there is nothing like you think. You please, come to the side with me,
we will sit and talk. That’s it, we cannot talk to you people 
about anything. The person who lies once, 
they lie again and again. You people are not worth trusting. No brother… Brother Iqbal, listen to us, give us a chance to clarify. You just listen to brother once. Sister in law, believe me, Anwar is right. If there is something, us family should sit and talk about it, we shouldn’t make noise in front 
of the guests like this. Really? Is there something left to talk about now? Son, Nabeel, son, make your mother understand. 
Make her understand. Leave it aunt, we don’t need to understand, 
you need to understand. We are decent people and your daughter also has an affair 
with Fahad’s friend. Fahad, tell them. He is absolutely right. If you don’t believe me, then I will show you too. You too see it. Papa… Alizay, shall we hurry up? I think 
we are getting a little late. What is problem, Afnan? 
Let me eat properly. Where do you have to go? Hey, I don’t have to go anywhere. Dad has strictly instructed, 
we should reach there on time. If dad finds out then 
he will get really angry. We will get food packed. 
You can go home and eat. Oh thank you so much,
you brought me here. How will I thank you? You did such a big favour on me. No, no, don’t get upset. Okay fine, you eat properly, it is okay. No leave it, let’s go. What is wrong? Why do you get angry all of a sudden? I am telling you, easy, 
make yourself comfortable. I will talk to dad, okay? You too eat. Look brother, why are you looking away? See what sort of clothes 
your daughter is wearing. Do girls of decent homes wear 
such clothes? No aunty, my papa and mama has no fault in this, they have no mistake, 
it is all cause of me. I am responsible for all this. The wrong use of social media has 
not just made my head bow down, but it has bowed down 
my entire family today. I did lose my way in the search 
of cheap fame and money, but I didn’t go off track. God brought me back on the 
right track, aunty. I had made a mistake, don’t punish me like this. Mistake? You are calling your sin a mistake? Who did you run away with? I would say, whoever she ran with, marry her to him and save your respect, that would be really better for you. Hey, now I understand why they were in a hurry 
to get the wedding done. Hey, they must have thought 
there is still time. Put someone else’s sin on others. Hey, obviously, she was away from home
for so many days, so she must have done a lot. No, no, sister Farida, fear God. Our daughter only and only left home
 in search of fame. But she didn’t run away with a boy,
 there is nothing like that. I am not shameless like you people. If my daughter had gone somewhere, I would not have let her come back home. I explained the same thing to you, now the world is calling you shameless. Had I known your daughter’s actions, I would never have brought 
a proposal here. You have made a joke out of us
 in front of the world. Thank you so much, Afnan. It was a lot of fun today. A person should have outings. I am tired cause of office work. Hey, I ask you that let’s go for a drive, we will go out, but you don’t have time. You know how tough my job is. I have a lot of responsibility. That is why I don’t get time. Okay, Alizay, listen. Dad has put such a big responsibility 
on my head for no reason. There is a friend of his, Mr. Sajid, I have to drop an entrustment 
to him on the way, so can we stop there for two minutes? Afnan, please, no, drop me home, then you can go where you want, please. Alizay, come on, please try 
and understand. It is already really late, 
I should have been there earlier. Afnan, why are you taking me there, 
please? Man, it will take two minutes, 
this, see, this is their location. 
This is it. This is it. Molvi Sahib, why are you sitting here? This wedding won’t take place.
 They wasted our time, you don’t waste your time and 
go to some other wedding. Come on, Nabeel. 
Aunty. Aunty, no. Aunty, no, no, no. 
Come on. Please don’t end this proposal, aunty. I will do what you tell me to. I will listen to everything you say. 
I will not say for anything. I am even ready to live as 
the maid of your home. I will not make any wish. 
I will do what you tell me to do. But, aunt, please don’t end this proposal. 
Please. I beg you. I fall to your feet, aunty, please. Please, don’t end this proposal aunty. My father’s head has been bowed 
cause of me, aunty. Please don’t end this relation, 
please accept me aunty. That’s it.
