Ramsha, I have asked Jamshed to bring
all your stuff here but let me know if there is anything left,
I will get it. Yes, there is something left. Really? What is left? Your love. The love for which you took me
to that house, I want that love and respect
from you Afnan that you promised to give me for life. Umm, I... I am going out with Alizeh. You can have food,
I will have it outside. Afnan? Afnan, come quickly. Yes, come let’s go. How do I look? You look very nice. Does this color suit me? Yes, it suits you a lot. Actually Afnan, we are going out
together after so long so I thought of wearing something
you would like. That is what you have always done, you have always cared about
what I like and dislike. You are a very good wife. Shall we leave,
aren’t you getting late now? Let’s go.
Let’s go. Did you like it? Hmm. I have my doctor’s appointment tomorrow,
will you come along? Do one thing, get an appointment and
let me know I will come from the office. Okay I will do that. Umm Alizeh, you must go
and rest now, I will come in a while. Why? Where are you going? To Ramsha? Yes, Alizeh, I have to look after her as well. Let me go check 
if she has slept or not. Afnan, we were just together, we spent such good time, 
now why are you going? You are still worried about her. 
Alizey, it is obligatory on me 
to care about her, she is my wife, my responsibility, if I won’t fulfill my responsibilities today, I will have to answer to God tomorrow. You go and rest for a while, 
I will come. You know what is the problem 
with women like you? When your husband is doing 
something unlawful, it doesn't make any difference to you but when they lawfully accepts 
someone and marry them, you women have an objection on that, it doesn’t get up to your standards. What are your standards? That pathetic girl? That TikToker who eloped 
from her house? Enough! Don’t say a word after that, Alizey. My colleagues have called me 
so many times just to ask, after all what has Afnan done to you? What should I tell everyone about 
your nephew’s doings? I will be the one facing trouble if I go, everyone will have just one question, why did Afnan marry a TikToker 
and left such a good wife? Enough Alizey, people act very innocent but 
they are not that innocent from within, they know everything and 
they even know that such girls trap honorable boys 
and marry them. And Alizey, you are not the first wife there are thousands of such wives 
going through the same trial. How dare you even step 
into this house? I have brought her here. She will not live in this house, she will get out of here, 
get out of here! Alizey, Alizey, what is wrong with you?
 Control yourself. please I don’t want more chaos
in this house. Whatever you want to say, 
say it to me, I have brought Ramsha here. I don’t want to talk about anything, if she will live in this house, 
I won’t live here. I am leaving. Girls like Ramsha find honorable boys who are family-oriented and rich too, they marry them and that is what Ramsha did too. You are honorable, family-oriented, 
and rich too, she married you and defamed you and then she got famous overnight because that is what she wanted. I loved you so much, Ramsha and I still do, I wish you wouldn’t have 
disgraced my love. It is true that I am unable to take out 
love for you from my heart even if I want to. I wish you would have been 
the way I thought of you. Ramsha, I wish you were actually 
so peaceful and innocent as you seem. I loved you more than myself and I always will. Umm, son, you go wait downstairs, 
I will be there, go. Greetings. Greetings, why have you come here? We stopped you from coming here. I just came to ask how 
Ramsha was doing. I found out she is not well 
so I was worried. Whatever it is, if you had to ask about her wellbeing, 
you could have called, there was no reason for you
to come here. If Afnan has mistakenly 
married Ramsha, it doesn’t mean you are our relative, after all, we have a status, you should think before coming here. Aunt, how are you talking 
to my aunt? Now you will tell me what should 
I talk with whom? Guests that come home are respected 
as honorable people, they are not insulted. Ramsha, listen to me very carefully, any of your relatives won’t come 
to my house now. Why? I am Afnan’s wife, I have full rights
 to this house, and that is why, my relatives will
definitely come here. Aunt, come with me. Listen, Afnan is not home right now, it is better that you leave this house. If you don’t leave, I will hold your hand and drag you 
out of this house and trust me there is no one is this house 
who can stop me. You cannot take me out of this house, I am leaving this house myself, not just because you want me to leave, but because I don’t want to live 
in this house. Lower your tone when you talk to me. I guess you are forgetting 
your position in this house. When I will prove you to be the culprit, the stains on my character will only 
be removed then and both of you won’t be able to save 
yourselves from the drops of it. I am leaving this house, I am leaving this house Alizey, but I will definitely come back 
to this house, and I will prove that the trust and 
belief uncle had on me, I never jeopardized it. You and your mother have 
tried to defame me, I will prove it wrong at any cost. And I am not responsible 
for Uncle’s death, both of you are, I will definitely 
prove that. I suggest you throw her out 
of this house. I cannot do that, my hands are tied, my hands are tied to the promise 
Dad made me do it when he was dying, he gave me the responsibility of 
taking care of Ramsha always. You try to make Alizey understand, I cannot break the promise 
I made to dad. My child, if I had any idea that Afsheen wouldn’t like that I came here,
I would have never come here at all. I am sorry on her behalf but, you forget all this, let it go. Tell me how is uncle and what about the shop? Your uncle is fine, he has added new articles 
to the shop. Your uncle and Shani are both 
busy with that. Just pray that shop starts running 
like before. Everything will get fine, 
if God wills. Tell me, you will at least have tea, 
right? No, daughter, okay tell me, are you happy? And does Afnan take care fo you? Yes, aunt. I am very happy, thank God, Afnan takes very good care of me and he loves me a lot too. God has willed. Alizey and Afsheen do bother you,
 right? Thank God, Afnan takes care of you. It’s great, my child, if you have support 
from your husband, a woman can face the worst of storms. Thank God. My daughter. Tell me about Annie? Annie misses you a lot. Look Afnan, I am telling you all this because when people will see, 
what will they think? Obviously they will talk, and Shani is not just Ramsha’s cousin but he was also her ex-husband. Look there have been a lot 
of stories already now I don’t want anyone to create 
issues regarding this girl. More than half of the world knows
 your wife, there is a huge issue made 
out of every little thing. Don’t worry, Aunt, 
I will talk to Ramsha. There is no need to talk, 
make her understand, there is no need for her to fulfill 
relationships with them now, who never gave her support, love or owned her and that ill-mannered Shani, I don’t like that guy at all. Did you forget him? Did you see his attitude after marriage? And how he misbehaved 
so much with brother, you can forget all this, 
I cannot, Afnan. You are a very feelingless man, you will regret a lot. Hey, get out of here, I have no regrets. Come on, son, get lost, come on. I used to think you were a 
very intelligent man but you turned out to be 
the number 1 fool, you even forget how living with 
Ramsha can be so beneficial for you. What benefit does she bring to me? Take it. Keep it there. Did someone come today? Yes, Aunt came. Okay and anyone else? No, no one else came, aunt was telling that Annie has taken admission somewhere,
she is learning to stitch that is why she went there 
so Aunt came alone. okay, do one thing, think again, no one else came along, right? No Afnan, I told you it was just aunt, why do you keep on asking 
again and again? Because you are lying to me. What do you think I don’t find out whatever is happening
 in this house? I know it very well that 
Shani came too, why did he come? No, No Afnan, there is nothing like 
that Shani didn’t come here. Aunt was saying that uncle or Shani 
might come to pick her up, Shani might have come 
to pick her up, I didn’t see him, and he didn’t come in front of me. Listen to me very carefully, I don’t want to see Shani 
in this house now, else I won’t show any courtesy and do let everyone in that house 
know as well. Yes, come let’s go. How do I look? You look very nice. Does this color suit me? Yes, it suits you a lot. Actually Afnan, we are going out 
together after so long so I thought of wearing something 
you would like. That is what you have always done, you have always cared about 
what I like and dislike. You are a very good wife. Shall we leave, 
aren’t you getting late now? Let’s go. 
Let’s go. Ramsha, my child, people who agrees
to God’s choice stay very happy, who agree to His choice, have higher ranks, there is better in everything that 
God does, He agrees to it. if you agree with Him, 
your heart stay in peace, by the grace of God. Who teaches all this to you, Uncle? God is the greatest. I used to think like you as well, like you get random thoughts, 
we become miser, if we don’t have things of our choice,
heart starts to feel low. Why didn’t it happen like this, what I wanted, 
why didn’t that happen? Then I just got the company 
of religious people and then I took small steps towards 
religion and started learning gradually, there are a lot of blessings 
in the knowledge of religion.
