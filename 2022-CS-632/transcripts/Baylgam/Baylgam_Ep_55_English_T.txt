[19.84] You guys must have gotten 
a good idea now,
[23.12] that what an illiterate person have you 
handed over a girl like Ramsha.
[40.12] I was refusing you guys from
 the very beginning
[42.32] that please don’t get this marriage done, 
but no one listens to me in this house.
[59.04] My God knows that I had no idea 
that Shani is like this,
[63.88] just met him two to three times.
[65.88] So dad, we should have investigated first.
[89.92] I am sorry dad, I just meant to say
[93.36] that let’s suppose that if it was another girl 
from our house instead of Ramsha,
[106.52] you would have investigated well 
before making a decision, right?
[118.48] I was just saying it because of this.
[124.68] Afnan, we investigate for strangers,
[128.20] they are her own family.
[134.68] And Ramsha married by her own will.
[149.96] You are having a huge 
misunderstanding, aunt,
[155.56] Ramsha wasn’t willing to get 
married here at all,
[162.96] ask your daughter
[164.88] who used to blame her over
 everything and anything.
[186.24] And dad,
[188.44] dad now said that she will be
 going to the hostel,
[191.40] what else would the poor girl do?
[200.40] Whatever had to happen, 
has happened,
[207.76] why are you blaming all of us?
[210.16] First of all behave yourself,
[215.24] I am very angry right now.
[234.16] And didn’t you all see it yourself
[236.32] that Shani is such an ill-mannered guy?
[250.56] Just think how will the poor girl 
survive there?
[265.64] Shani is not a stranger to Ramsha,
[277.04] Ramsha has grown with those 
ill-mannered people all her life,
[292.88] she has lived in the same house,
[294.84] I think you don’t have 
to worry about her.
[327.84] Did you see how he was talking to me?
[332.68] Relax. Sit down.
[388.24] If you have forgotten your past,
[390.24] what do you think people will 
forget your past too?
[395.40] Your videos, your pictures,
[398.24] they are just a click away 
from people.
[406.20] The disgusting videos and pictures 
that you have uploaded,
[410.16] they haven’t been removed from 
the minds of men.
[417.36] No one gives respect to girls like you,
[421.44] I am surprised about the fact
[424.48] how brother made you his daughter?
[437.36] Do you have any idea
[439.04] how much favors have brother done 
to you and your mother?
[447.20] And what did you give him? 
Depression?
[450.56] Distance from his son?
[454.32] Look madam,
[455.72] if you are even a little sincere 
with brother,
[459.76] then marry your cousin.
[465.00] And leave this house forever 
and ever
[469.40] and never ever come back again.
[478.24] Why are you acting so pious?
[482.16] Have you forgotten your past?
[486.24] I knew it,
[487.60] I knew very well about your 
shallowness.
[490.36] Yes I am shallow, you got me
absolutely right,
[493.56] and after the marriage, you will realize
that I am not just shallow
[497.28] but very pathetic too
[499.24] because I have remembered everything
[503.08] and I will take revenge for 
each one of it.
[514.84] You had arranged so much, 
what was the need of this formality?
[519.04] I will tell you,
[520.52] actually they feel that 
we don’t get to eat all this
[531.20] that is why she got 
so many things made
[534.44] and I understand that all this is being
done to brag it to me,
[538.60] and if you won’t brag it to me 
how will you degrade me?
[546.80] No, no my child, 
there is nothing like that.
[550.24] We just expressed our love and 
affection towards you,
[553.88] if you disliked something,
[557.48] I apologize.
[563.84] No, no,
[565.44] actually it is my fault that I came here 
on his invitation
[568.92] because he just had one purpose,
[570.40] they had called me here to humiliate me
and degrade me, what else?
[577.68] Enough, Shani, For God’s…
What do you mean by enough?
[580.32] Don’t you see how 
they are humiliating me?
[582.64] If you have to be humiliated here 
and eat then you may eat!
[586.16] I am leaving.
[589.80] Let’s go Ramsha.
[611.88] Greetings, Mr Qasim.
[613.96] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[617.68] How are you?
[618.92] I am fine, by the grace of God
[622.52] but I feel Ramsha is not fine 
in your home.
[629.36] Umm, actually,
[633.20] Mr Qasim, I understand 
what you mean.
[641.28] Trust me when Shani came home,
[645.44] I scolded him a lot,
[653.04] even his mother scolded him a lot.
[662.40] My son is just a little bitter by tongue
[666.32] but he is very good at heart.
[668.36] Only God knows what’s inside 
one’s heart, Mr Anwar,
[676.60] a person’s attitude is figured out 
by how they speak,
[679.80] you can judge a person’s brought up 
only by how they talk and behave.
[684.20] Yes, yes, you are right.
[686.60] Actually Mr. Qasim, 
I will talk to you later,
[698.04] actually, I am at the shop and 
there is a lot of rush,
[700.56] I will talk to you later.
[703.52] Okay fine, bye.
[706.20] Bye.
[777.28] What happened?
[780.16] Dad, I am tired of this bike.
[783.12] The petrol is also full but 
it still won’t start,
[786.04] even my friends make fun 
of my bike now.
[788.72] It’s not like you don’t have money.
[792.28] Dad, you are saying as 
if you have a bank
[794.92] and now it’s time for you to increase
 my pocket money,
[798.12] I am married, it is not a joke.
[800.80] So why are you crying?
[808.88] Is it a problem for you to 
get a new bike?
[818.72] Listen, talk to Ramsha,
[821.96] she will ask Mr Qasim and 
you will get a new bike.
[832.52] Why are you looking at me like this?
[834.96] I am absolutely right.
[843.00] Mr Qasim has a lot of money,
[852.36] he shows so much love for our Ramsha,
[854.80] can’t he do this for her?
[862.12] I will suggest, forget about the bike,
[865.32] talk about car, car,
[872.80] if we get a new car at home, 
it will be such a facility for us,
[881.64] are family is growing, two bikes won’t be
 enough for us.
[893.04] And think about your mother,
[895.88] if we will have a car at home,
[897.60] it will be easy for us to take her 
to the hospital.
[904.12] If not about yourself,
think about your mother.
[925.64] Do you understand,
[927.40] okay now let me start.
[929.76] In the name of God. Here.
[935.48] This is called old is gold,
[938.08] go now.
[939.88] Car.
[941.60] Car.
[950.00] Brother?
[952.16] I asked you to cook meat,
 you haven’t done it yet?
[955.76] What happened? 
What happened?
[958.08] Go see, Ramsha is working 
in the kitchen.
[962.16] Aunt. 
I asked you to do it.
[963.56] What happened? Why are you 
getting so angry?
[966.68] I have kept the meet for cooking 
and knead the dough as well,
[969.08] now we will make piping hot bread 
before dinner and then eat it.
[972.12] Don’t scold her please.
[977.08] My child you are a newly wed bride,
[979.36] how many days has it been 
since you got married,
[986.36] it doesn’t look nice to make you 
do all house chores.
[991.20] Aunt, what is wrong?
[993.56] It is the same if I work or Annie do.
[1005.56] And I have to work later on as well,
[1008.48] anyway, so isn’t it better if I do now?
[1014.20] By the way,
[1015.60] I get very surprised when I look at you,
[1025.04] you would never touch any work before
[1039.28] and now you have taken care of the entire 
house as soon as you came here.
[1050.44] Thank God that I got rid of me,
[1051.92] else mom used to be after 
my life all the time.
[1059.36] It’s good Annie, you must just focus 
on your studies.
[1067.64] When I look at you I realize that 
I wish I would have focused on my studies
[1072.08] so I would have been somewhere today.
[1083.56] But Anyway, you have to study well
[1086.60] so you can do something big 
in your life, hmm?
[1090.56] I promise, I will study with full 
concentration,
[1093.84] thank you Ramsha, you are very nice.
[1098.28] If I had someone else as my 
sister in law, mom,
[1101.24] so she would have made me do all the work
and wouldn’t have done anything herself.
[1103.96] Hey, what is this?
[1105.92] You are making my newlywed bride work?
[1112.84] We are not making your bride work,
[1115.76] she is running around the whole house
and working herself.
[1125.04] Okay I don’t know anything today,
[1127.20] I and Ramsha are going out for 
an outing today.
[1140.40] You go get ready.
[1144.04] What?
[1153.80] Okay what is there to make fun of?
[1165.76] Since we have gotten married, 
we haven’t gone for an outing,
[1168.64] in fact, cook the food yourself today.
[1171.56] Okay, okay, fine, fine.
Okay okay.
[1175.12] We will have dinner outside.
[1181.76] Why are you looking at me like this?
[1187.64] Go and get ready then we will leave.
[1190.16] My child, quickly leave, leave,
[1193.28] my son’s plan might change.
[1195.76] Quickly go. 
Go.
[1200.16] You guys are making her work. Hey?
[1203.00] You are so clever,
[1204.96] you get ready yourself as well.
[1206.88] Mom, you know that is my style, 
I don’t need to get ready.
[1219.96] And I don’t understand one thing,
[1221.60] why were you laughing in front of her?
[1223.52] you guys were making fun of me?
[1225.56] Hey, we weren’t making fun of you,
[1228.12] we are happy,
[1229.64] at least you realized about 
her yourself.
[1232.28] That’s great.
[1303.40] Listen, wear this.
[1310.96] If you don’t like it then wear something 
of your own choice.
[1314.24] No it’s fine, it’s good.
[1318.68] Okay then get nicely ready.
[1328.00] We are going out for the first time.
[1336.84] What happened?
[1339.20] You don’t look happy.
[1342.56] When did I say that?
[1346.44] Your face seems like it,
[1348.36] else wives get really happy 
when going out.
[1352.84] I am happy.
[1358.92] I am very happy, in fact,
[1360.48] I am very shocked too
[1362.92] that you never asked me to go out,
[1369.80] you never took me out for dinner 
or an outing
[1373.44] so all of a sudden, 
why being so generous?
[1377.68] You know that I am a bit moody.
[1386.44] And plans will be made like this
[1393.24] now quickly get ready,
[1399.52] okay then we will leave, 
I will change too.
[1404.44] Get dressed nicely, okay?
[1425.16] it is a such an expensive restaurant, 
Shani,
[1427.92] why have you brought me here,
[1429.68] do you know the bill will be 
so high for this food.
[1433.20] Ramsha, why do you worry 
about the bill?
[1435.32] Am I worried about the bill?
[1437.40] If I am not worried about it then 
why are you worried?
[1440.96] And by the way I have brought you 
out to a restaurant for the first time,
[1443.84] I couldn’t have taken you 
to any mediocre place.
[1446.44] Yes, but this restaurant seems 
so expensive Shani,
[1449.68] and if you will do this, 
your budget will get off.
[1453.12] Yes,
[1454.48] but I will accept this for your happiness.
[1458.12] You just tell me are you happy?
[1463.08] you thought so much for me,
[1464.80] why wouldn’t I be happy?
[1470.72] Thank you so much.
[1473.64] Our life will move forward 
like this from now on.
[1477.00] You will keep me happy and 
I will keep you happy.
[1534.64] Wow,
[1537.00] they are enjoying here,
[1539.08] and everyone at home is worried 
because of them.
[1543.40] Alizey,
[1544.92] come let’s go somewhere else.
[1547.56] No, no, come let’s meet them.
[1549.72] No no Alizey, why do you want 
to meet them?
[1553.24] Alizey, they are here to enjoy 
their dinner,
[1555.44] it doesn’t look nice if we go and 
disturb them for no reason.
[1560.12] Look don’t misunderstand 
what I am saying,
[1563.08] I am just saying that you know
 Shani very well,
[1567.36] how ill-mannered and illiterate he is,
[1575.48] I don’t want him to misbehave with you
[1579.08] and then I get in any sort of heated 
argument with him.
[1598.64] Okay now come on,
[1600.12] why are wasting our time standing here?
[1605.00] Okay let’s do one thing,
[1608.40] we will go sit on the floor upstairs.
[1609.80] Hmm. 
Come.
[1634.04] uncle was getting worried for no reason,
[1636.36] did you see how happy Ramsha was?
[1639.36] She was laughing and smiling so much,
[1642.32] actually, both of them did this to 
create tension in our house.
[1650.04] By the way, Ramsha didn’t misbehave,
Shani did.
[1653.32] Whatever,
[1654.36] Ramsha ran crying and 
whining after Shani.
[1657.92] And what was the need for her to cry
and whine in front of uncle,
[1663.96] didn’t you see how happy she was?
[1666.08] She was smiling.
[1667.44] I have never seen her smiling 
so much in my life.
[1670.60] Uncle is worried there and 
she celebrating here.
[1677.64] Yes, I saw, why wouldn’t I see?
[1680.56] But I feel that more than 
Shani’s misbehavior,
[1685.48] you are angry at the fact that 
why was Ramsha happy with Shani.
[1690.92] What are you trying to say?
[1693.24] I said what I wanted to.
[1695.04] I am just saying
[1696.68] that why does Ramsha give us 
tension because of herself?
[1700.84] By the way, answer one thing honestly,
[1704.16] when there was the time to give tension,
you didn’t cause any,
[1707.76] now why are you tensed?
[1715.32] Anyway, forget that,
[1718.20] we have come out to eat 
so your mood can get better,
[1722.44] if we have to discuss the same thing 
outside too,
[1725.68] then there is no point of coming out.
[1728.20] It’s their life, let them live.
[1730.00] So when am I stopping her from living?
[1732.24] She can do whatever she wants to 
but she shouldn’t create tension in our lives.
[1736.68] You just leave it, let’s do one thing,
[1739.76] let’s go to the sea-side after finishing food.
[1743.40] I have a very important meeting tomorrow,
[1745.64] I have to prepare for it as well
[1747.32] so we will go home after this.
[1750.44] Okay fine, as you wish.
[1759.64] You have no fights with the food,
so have food.
[1788.92] Greetings. 
Greetings brother.
[1790.76] Greetings. How are you?
[1793.12] Greetings, I am fine,
[1794.64] everything is fine, right? 
What happened?
[1796.28] Yes, why? 
What has happened?
[1797.72] No, actually you went with brother,
[1801.00] so I was tensed that how 
he must have behaved with you.
[1806.64] Why are you laughing Ramsha?
[1810.20] There is nothing like 
what you are thinking.
[1812.92] Everything was absolutely fine.
[1814.68] We went to a nice restaurant 
and had nice food,
[1818.12] and then came back, 
in front of you,
[1820.68] everything was fine, 
nothing happened.
[1823.56] Are you sure?
[1824.52] Yes, why would I lie?
 Come sit.
[1832.00] Ramsha, your prayers are being 
answered,
[1835.40] brother’s heart is changing for you.
[1837.88] I hope that’s how it is.
[1841.36] Wait a minute, 
your prayers are being answered,
[1843.32] do one thing, pray that God,
[1845.16] please God, dad agrees to let me 
study further.
[1850.04] Pray.
[1850.96] Okay Annie, I will pray for you.
[1853.76] Okay fi…
[1856.24] Now what?
[1857.40] Are you doing some recitation ritual?
[1860.36] Yes I am.
[1863.28] See, I felt that you were doing something,
[1866.00] tell me what is it I will do the same.
[1870.68] You just listen to your God
[1873.32] and He will listen to you.
[1876.08] Do you know
[1878.44] when a person listens to their God,
[1881.72] worships Him, thank Him,
[1886.40] God gets close to us as well,
[1888.80] not just in this world
[1890.76] but everything becomes easy for us 
in the life hereafter as well.
[1897.32] By being close to God,
[1900.08] people start loving and 
respecting us more.
[1904.28] God blesses us with more 
than we can think,
[1909.16] that is why start offering prayers,
[1912.40] everything will become easy.
[1914.08] You are absolutely right,
[1916.32] do one thing, wake me up for Fajr too 
when you wake up.
[1918.76] I will offer prayers with you and
I will get regular with prayers.
[1922.32] You will offer prayers? 
Definitely, I will.
[1924.24] Okay then,
[1925.32] I will wake you up for Fajr 
from now onwards, hmm?
[1928.84] Okay I will go change 
then we will sit and talk.
[1931.12] Okay.
[1958.64] I spoke to Ramsha.
[1962.60] How is Ramsha, brother?
[1964.28] She is well, by the grace of God,
[1966.60] she sounded satisfied.
[1975.36] I got satisfied by talking to her as well.
[1980.96] Okay, that’s good.
[1989.16] Afsheen, I am not well usually
[1993.52] so why don’t you go to 
Ramsha’s house with Afnan?
[2002.60] What would they think about us
[2004.84] that no one came to meet Ramsha 
after marriage.
[2010.24] Yes, brother you are right,
[2019.60] you know that Alizey is at office all day
[2023.44] so I have to look after the entire house.
[2033.64] I have to be after the servants all day 
to get the work done
[2037.88] so I don’t get any time from 
such busy schedule.
[2043.64] Afsheen, if Alizey has gotten married 
and went to a different house,
[2047.76] you must have gone 
to meet her too, right?
[2054.24] yes,
[2057.04] absolutely.
[2065.68] Okay brother, I will go.
[2069.24] Don’t keep fried things, 
like bakery items etc.
[2077.16] Oh God,
[2079.12] brother is fulfilling the relationships 
like she is biological family.
[2083.00] Oh God, who will go in 
those narrow streets?
[2087.08] Things I do for brother.
[2119.56] Ramsha, I am thinking to change the bike,
[2122.60] this one is causing a lot of trouble.
[2125.12] Even when I was going to the shop 
yesterday, it stopped on way.
[2130.00] Should I get a new bike?
[2134.00] yes but new bike must be 
so expensive, right Shani?
[2137.92] it is expensive but for us,
[2144.12] if Mr Qasim buys it for us?
[2147.04] Hunh?
[2148.64] Where did he come in to 
this conversation from?
[2150.48] What difference does it make to him, 
he is so rich,
[2153.00] will it be a problem for him 
to get a bike?
[2156.96] And why would he give you money 
for a bike, Shani?
[2160.08] That’s the thing,
[2161.68] he wouldn’t give me the money, 
he will give it to you,
[2164.16] look he would never say no to you, 
he considers you his daughter.
[2169.44] Are you mad?
[2176.68] Have you gone crazy? 
Why would I take money from him?
[2179.92] I never even took money from him 
while living in that house,
[2182.76] and I will do now. 
Don’t even think.
[2184.92] It was different before,
you are married now,
[2187.88] responsibilities increase after marriage, 
and expenses increase too.
[2191.80] I am your responsibility Shani, 
not his.
[2194.40] Why would he give me money?
[2195.92] By the way, it is the limit, 
it is the limit,
[2198.80] I took you to the restaurant, 
made you eat food,
[2201.16] took you for an outing
[2202.96] and you cannot even do 
this much for me?
[2205.72] Shani?
[2207.60] I thought you did all of that 
for my happiness,
[2210.76] you were doing all this to get 
your work done by me?
[2213.24] okay listen, I don’t want 
to get into all this,
[2216.24] you will go to their house tomorrow
and bring money, okay?
[2221.24] You have gone absolutely mad,
[2223.00] neither I will go to him nor will I ask 
for money from him
[2226.28] so you can do whatever you want.
[2228.60] Weird…
[2229.40] Ramsha, I am telling you, 
you are making me angry now,
[2231.96] you know when I get angry 
how dangerous I become.
