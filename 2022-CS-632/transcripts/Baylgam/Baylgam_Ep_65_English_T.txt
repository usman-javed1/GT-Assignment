[21.84] Take this.
[24.08] Any idea how long will it take 
to get the visa?
[28.88] And when you get the tickets for me?
[30.84] Brother Shani, don’t worry at all,
[33.20] your visa and ticket will be here soon.
[36.88] Since you have made the complete payment,
your work will be done soon as well.
[40.44] That’s fine but when?
[42.84] I am telling you your work 
will be done soon,
[46.32] since you have made the full payment,
 your work will be done soon too.
[48.80] Yes, Wasim was praising you a lot
[51.28] and he was saying that 
you are very good with work
[53.20] and you get it done quickly.
[54.96] Yes, yes, that’s how it is,
[56.52] you just do your preparation to leave,
[59.88] your work is about to get done soon.
[61.68] Yes, yes, the preparations 
are complete,
[63.44] don’t worry about that.
[64.60] Okay then what is the wait for?
[66.80] You might be in Dubai by next week,
[71.44] just remember,
[73.00] don’t forget your brother 
once you get to Dubai.
[75.12] Yes, yes, don’t worry about that
[77.72] obviously if you are doing something nice 
for me how can I forget you?
[82.40] I will remember you.
[83.84] Just get me to Dubai once.
[85.96] Don’t worry at all,
[87.32] you won’t have to face any problems, 
okay?
[94.32] Okay sir, I shall leave now.
[96.72] Thank you so much, and you can call me 
if you have any query, okay?
[100.40] Thank you.
[160.80] Whenever I try that there is 
no complaint from your end,
[164.56] that’s it, you make a mistake right 
then and there.
[171.36] Alizeh, just because of your 
own foolish actions,
[175.32] brother and Afnan are being 
negative about you.
[182.64] Just pray that Ramsha leaves 
as soon as possible from here
[189.40] else you will be living in hell here,
[193.68] just remember this.
[256.88] Afnan? 
Hmm?
[261.76] I was saying
[263.40] why don’t you try talking to Shani?
[269.64] I guess if Ramsha talks to him, 
he might not listen
[273.04] but if you or uncle do, 
he might listen to you guys.
[284.00] By the way, uncle is not well
[290.80] and if Shani misbehaves with uncle,
[294.52] he might not be able to bear it.
[300.72] So it will be better that 
you try to talk to him once.
[306.36] You are saying as if
[308.60] I will talk and Shani will immediately 
listen to me.
[311.64] He might.
[317.72] And look
[319.00] if something good happens for Ramsha
by any of our actions
[324.12] then that’s good. Afnan,
[334.24] I am actually very guilty,
[338.52] I am very sad that whatever is 
happening with Ramsha is not right.
[347.52] I am blaming myself,
[350.32] I guess it was my mistake that 
I took her there,
[358.24] I am a woman too I can understand
 her pain.
[362.52] And now I think that 
I shouldn’t have taken her there
[367.48] I don’t know what I should do.
[372.44] Relax,
[375.36] whatever will happen, it will be 
good from God’s end.
[383.60] I’ll go change.
[435.56] What are you doing here?
[438.56] May I sit?
[445.60] Umm,
[447.40] I went to your shop,
[453.52] I found out that you are here 
so I came here to meet you.
[465.00] I wanted to talk about something 
really important.
[467.52] About what?
[471.40] Shani,
[476.16] I wanted to request you 
that if you can,
[480.40] if you can come and bring Ramsha 
back to your home.
[485.12] Oh,
[487.32] so you are being her advocate?
[491.32] No, it’s not that.
[493.96] Look whatever happened was 
an accident,
[496.56] there was nothing true in it, 
you are having a misunderstanding.
[504.84] Ramsha is a very noble 
and sincere girl,
[508.12] and being your wife, 
she loves you a lot.
[517.48] Today I saw her crying for you, 
she was shedding tears.
[521.76] Wow,
[523.92] so that means her tears have 
brought you to a nobody like me?
[539.04] By the way, my wife is very fortunate,
[549.20] I mean,
[551.16] someone else also cares about her 
tears apart from her husband.
[572.76] It’s not that,
[576.04] I am telling you that you are having
a misunderstanding,
[579.00] you should let the poison of doubt 
out of your heart.
[588.32] I am telling you again and again that 
she loves you a lot being your wife.
[599.28] There is nothing between us.
[608.44] And she is not well,
[614.76] she doesn’t feel good, 
I am afraid that God forbid,
[618.04] something happens to her 
in this condition, then?
[621.76] It doesn’t make any difference to me.
[641.20] You are a very insensitive man,
[643.92] you will regret it a lot.
[645.08] Hey, hey, get lost from here.
[648.68] I have no regrets, 
do you understand?
[650.64] Come on, get lost, come on, 
come on, go.
[657.16] I thought you are a very intelligent man,
[661.32] but you turned out to be a big fool.
[667.32] You even forgot how living with 
Ramsha can be so beneficial for you.
[670.36] What benefit?
[675.76] Do you remember what I said?
[679.72] If you keep Ramsha happy,
[682.44] I will give you what you want,
[686.08] I guess you forgot this deal,
[688.76] so I am offering you the same deal again,
[692.32] don’t cause any trouble to Ramsha,
[696.08] Keep her happy
[699.40] and it’s my job to fulfill my promise.
[703.12] I am offering again,
[705.84] take your time to think.
[783.52] Annie, stop this crying and whining.
[788.00] My friend like sister is in so much pain,
[796.24] you guys don’t care at all.
[799.16] Ask brother to bring Ramsha home.
[803.88] What do you think?
[805.88] Wouldn’t I ask Shani?
[814.20] I have told him a lot of times but 
he doesn't hear, he is stubborn,
[817.76] I am fed up, myself.
[819.20] I don’t know anything, let’s go to
Mr. Qasim’s house,
[822.64] I cannot leave Ramsha alone 
during this time.
[825.32] We cannot go to Mr. Qasim’s house.
[827.64] Why, mom? Why can’t we go?
[830.92] Since when have we become 
so feelingless
[832.72] that we left her alone to suffer 
all the pain?
[835.96] Try to understand the sensitivity 
of the situation, Annie,
[838.08] I don’t have the answer to 
Mr. Qasim’s questions,
[840.48] I cannot face him.
[849.40] Till Shani cools down,
[853.44] it is better for us not to go there.
[863.24] And yes, if you care so much 
about your friend,
[867.60] you must pray to God
[876.60] that He makes things better for her
[879.00] and make Shani merciful towards her
[888.00] and love for and that Shani 
brings her home himself.
[926.84] Uncle?
[930.80] I want to go back home.
[938.04] Come sit here, my child.
[949.56] I want the same for you that your in-laws 
come here and take you home.
[962.36] I have been trying to call Anwar 
for a few days
[964.32] but he is not attending it.
[973.60] By the way Ramsha,
[975.28] I have never seen such in-laws ever.
[990.12] What sort of uncle and 
aunt do you have?
[1001.60] If your aunt loves you so much, 
she should have convinced Shani
[1007.20] and come here and should have 
taken you from here
[1013.92] but it has been so many days,
[1015.92] she didn’t even ask about 
your well-being.
[1020.60] Shani doesn't get convinced so easily.
[1028.08] I am sure Aunt must have definitely 
tried to convince him.
[1033.36] Leave it, Ramsha,
[1040.96] if your aunt cared so much,
[1043.24] you wouldn't be here but at your in-laws.
[1053.04] Uncle,
[1054.88] I know Shani is very adamant on his words,
[1057.56] he will never come to take me back.
[1066.12] Please let me go home on my own.
[1069.80] Ramsha, my child you haven’t completely 
recovered yet.
[1101.52] Shani’s behavior is in front of you,
[1122.32] I don’t want to take any risk 
regarding your health.
[1126.08] Let’s wait for a while more,
 if they don’t come,
[1129.24] I and Afsheen will go and 
talk to them our self.
[1136.28] Don’t worry, okay?
[1208.12] If not my permission,
[1210.20] but you can at least inform me, 
I am your wife.
[1214.52] Yes,
[1216.20] and that is my problem,
[1219.04] that is why I have to tolerate you else…
[1223.04] You don’t care at all, right Shani?
[1230.40] You will leave me in this condition 
and go to Dubai?
[1232.72] Yes I am going,
[1234.20] and when I will be going there is 
no need to make a scene out of it
[1237.32] because I am not going to stop.
[1242.32] I am just traying to pay for 
my husband’s sins.
[1247.76] Sister-in-law,
[1249.36] I am very embarrassed,
[1251.32] whatever happened to you is very wrong,
[1255.68] forgive me, never curse my children.
[1258.88] What are you saying Salma?
[1261.24] Why will I curse them?
[1263.68] I have no complaints with you,
[1266.00] I have no complaints with you.
[1272.68] if your aunt cared so much,
[1275.08] you wouldn't be here 
but at your in-laws.
[1282.60] Come in.
[1286.76] Ramsha?
[1289.12] Quickly pack your bags, 
wear your shawl and let’s go.
[1291.76] Why? Is Shani here? 
No, no, Shani is not here.
[1298.04] So? Did uncle and aunt come?
[1300.32] No, no, none of them has come
[1302.08] but if you want to go home yourself
you can,
[1304.80] I will just take you there.
[1312.00] Look Ramsha, don’t be upset.
[1322.64] I know it very well that 
you miss your family a lot,
[1327.88] I have seen you squirming for Shani,
[1334.76] you are even doing so much to save 
my relationship with Alizeh,
[1340.52] so can I not do such a small thing
to save your relationship?
[1350.48] And I know you must hesitate 
to go home yourself
[1354.92] but I will be with you.
[1363.24] And you can win the heart of your family
 by your patience.
[1372.60] So that is why, have courage and be strong,
and come with me.
[1376.36] Okay I will get my shawl.
[1377.96] Okay I am waiting for you in the car.
[1402.32] Just stop here, Afnan.
[1404.08] Here?
[1412.08] I will go in alone,
[1414.84] you don’t come, please.
[1418.36] Okay.
[1419.52] If Shani sees me with you, 
he will get more upset.
[1424.84] As you wish.
[1427.60] Thank you. Bye.
[1429.76] Bye.
[1445.68] Who is it?
[1453.04] Who is it?
[1456.00] Ramsha?
[1459.36] How are you, Annie?
[1460.64] I am absolutely fine.
[1463.60] It’s good that you came, 
I missed you a lot.
[1468.16] I missed you all a lot too.
[1470.80] Do you know 
I was really missing you.
[1473.80] How are Uncle and Aunt?
[1475.32] Everyone is fine. How are you? 
How are you feeling?
[1477.92] I am absolutely fine. 
Annie.
[1482.84] Greetings Shani.
[1484.76] How dare you come here?
[1487.64] Get out of here.
[1496.88] Shani, where will I go 
if I won’t come here?
[1505.80] You, you just sit here for 10 minutes
 and listen to me
[1509.60] then you can take whatever 
decision you feel like.
[1512.72] I said get out else 
I will drag you outside.
[1530.16] Brother, let her come in at least.
Shut up,
[1536.76] Did I ask for your suggestion?
[1544.84] Go inside.
[1546.20] Annie, go call Uncle and aunt. Go.
[1549.00] They are not home, 
they have gone to a funeral.
[1562.20] Brother, let mom and dad come first 
and then you can take a decision.
[1565.00] Ramsha, let’s go in right now. 
Wait here,
[1568.36] I will drag you out of here in front of 
the whole neighborhood,
[1570.76] I will do this if you want.
[1572.80] Why are you so merciless?
[1582.52] If I will not come to this house, 
where else will I go Shani?
[1584.96] This is my house.
[1594.32] You are my Husband, 
and I am your wife.
[1602.76] You are asking me to leave 
my own house?
[1608.60] Look Shani,
[1609.92] even after so much has happened, 
I still came back in this house again
[1612.96] just for you
[1615.68] so I can spend my life with you,
[1617.68] I will die if you push me away from you.
[1620.00] Don’t make me mad, I am telling 
you are making me so angry
[1624.68] that I will say something that you won’t be
able to come back to this house again.
[1642.08] Okay fine,
[1644.08] she is leaving, Ramsha, mom and 
dad are not here, you know his anger.
[1648.28] Don’t you understand?
Get out of here.
[1650.04] She is leaving, don’t say anything, please.
[1653.16] Ramsha, go, go from here right now.
[1682.08] You go inside too!
[1712.40] What happened?
[1714.68] What happened?
[1715.80] Why are you so worried?
 Is everything okay?
[1719.20] Come, come sit in the car, come.
[1732.68] Now tell me what happened?
[1740.76] Tell me, tell me, answer me,
[1742.56] if Shani has misbehaved with you
so I will go talk to him.
[1745.20] No Afnan,
[1746.88] Shani is very angry right now,
[1749.12] he will fight with you for no reason,
[1751.32] just leave from here for now.
[1754.96] Here, have water.
[1757.88] Water.
[1761.52] Tell me something what happened.
[1763.40] Take me home.
[1785.48] Who asked you to come to this house
without Ramsha?
[1799.00] You are our father now?
[1801.28] You will take all the decisions?
[1812.76] Do you know
[1814.24] because of you how much have we 
heard from Mr. Qasim today?
[1831.40] You haven’t left me capable to face him,
[1834.28] I am afraid
[1835.96] he will cancel the contract of our shop.
[1849.72] He will ruin our business along 
with the relationships.
[1853.52] You care about the shop as if 
we are getting a lot from it.
[1857.92] Don’t forget that all these luxuries 
that you have,
[1862.08] all the luxuries are because of that shop.
[1864.88] This taunt is not going to last 
very long as well.
[1871.40] I am going to Dubai.
[1878.84] What you earn in a year from this shop,
[1881.08] I will earn it in a month and show you.
[1884.32] Do you see him?
[1886.08] Do you see your child’s mouth?
[1895.08] How he is talking in front of his dad.
[1900.48] He hasn’t started earning yet,
[1903.04] I am afraid the day he starts to earn 
he will beat us with shoes on our heads.
[1907.52] So you are continuously taunting me too.
[1908.84] Okay quiet,
[1910.60] we are talking about Ramsha and you guys
have taken this somewhere else.
[1921.96] And Shani, stop being angry,
[1932.40] go and bring Ramsha with you,
[1934.84] this is not good that our daughter-in-law 
is living at someone else’s house.
[1938.20] Ramsha won’t come in this house.
[1951.56] And I will see who can bring her here.
[1953.40] Look, look at his stubbornness 
and adamant-ness,
[1963.24] listen to me, I will bring her here,
[1969.56] I and I will see what you can do.
[1972.48] Okay dad,
[1974.12] you bring her here and
if I say something wrong
[1977.52] then don’t say anything to me.
Oh please!
[1984.72] You are one to talk.
[2001.56] Umm dad, did you call me?
[2003.64] Yes.
[2006.48] You took Ramsha to her house?
[2016.72] I am asking you something.
[2021.60] Yes dad. 
Why?
[2025.20] Why did you do this without 
my permission?
[2035.64] Why are you quiet now?
 Answer me.
[2040.80] Because I cannot see tears 
in Ramsha’s eyes.
[2048.20] I want her to be happy 
with Shani that’s why.
[2052.52] Don’t tell me all this.
[2055.60] Do you have any idea
[2063.52] that what you have done can ruin 
her home instead of making it,
[2067.44] what is this foolish step?
[2074.12] Thank God that Shani didn’t see you 
with Ramsha
[2078.12] else he would have created havoc.
[2086.92] I even advised you and warned you 
to stay away from Ramsha’s matters,
[2094.08] I told you
[2102.04] and now this is the last time 
I am warning
[2105.80] if you ever do any sort of interference 
in Ramsha’s matter,
[2112.08] it won’t be good for you.
[2119.08] You may go now.
[2162.44] May God give some brain to these kids,
[2166.88] they don’t understand the sensitivity 
of these matters.
[2176.64] What is this behavior?
[2178.04] I have already paid 5 lacs, now 
what is this extra money for?
[2180.92] Dude, the policy has changed,
[2183.24] the visa fee has increased, 
you will have to pay 5 lac more.
[2187.92] Do you guys think I am mad?
[2193.20] I won’t give a penny more,
[2194.56] even if I had money, 
I still wouldn’t give it.
[2196.76] I told you what the agent told me,
now as you wish.
[2200.64] If you want your money back, 
I will ask him to give your money back.
[2204.08] Okay, ask him to refund my money.
[2206.28] Okay I will tell him
[2209.84] but remember one thing,
[2211.44] you won’t get the complete amount back,
25% will be deducted.
[2213.96] What do you mean I won’t get 
the whole amount back?
[2215.92] I need the entire amount back.
[2218.40] You are saying as if the agent has 
your payment in his pockets,
[2221.40] obviously he must have given it 
to people to get the work done.
[2225.68] Try to understand what I am saying.
[2228.64] It is just 5 lac rupees,
[2231.48] arrange it from somewhere.
[2235.88] And there is a huge difference between
the currency here and there,
[2239.32] you will get the money back 
in 2 to 4 months.
[2244.96] It will be in your pocket and 
then you will live your life easily.
[2252.76] Try to understand what I am saying.
