[25.68] Look Afnan,
[26.40] I am saying all this to you
[28.84] because what will people 
think when they see this?
[31.48] Obviously, they will talk.
[33.84] After all, Shani is not 
just Ramsha’s cousin,
[37.68] he has been her 
ex-husband too.
[46.92] Look,
[48.04] people have already
 talked enough
[50.16] and I don’t want
[51.36] that people create an
 issue because of this girl.
[62.44] More than half the world 
knows your wife.
[73.88] Small things are blown 
out of proportions Afnan.
[77.40] Aunt, don’t worry,
 I will talk to Ramsha.
[80.12] No need to talk to her.
[81.88] Make her understand
[83.12] not to live up to her relationship
 with those people.
[94.68] The people who never
 supported her,
[96.60] neither love, nor acceptance.
[107.72] And that ill-mannered Shani,
[109.40] I don’t like that boy one bit.
[122.88] Have you forgotten him?
[124.08] Did you see his behavior
 after marriage?
[134.32] And he misbehaved 
so much with brother.
[146.08] You can forget these things,
[147.80] but not me, Afnan.
[206.52] You are an indifferent man,
[209.36] you will regret a lot.
[210.44] Get lost from here.
[213.92] I have no regret, understand?
[216.04] Come on, child.
[216.60] Get lost from here. Leave.
[222.40] I used to think that you 
are a smart man,
[226.52] but you turned out to be really stupid.
[232.64] You even forgot
[233.68] the benefit you can get 
out of living with Ramsha.
[235.72] What benefit will I get from her?
[265.60] Here you go.
[267.60] Keep it there.
[273.72] Did someone come today?
[276.00] Yes, aunt came over.
[279.24] Okay. Anyone else?
[283.52] No, no one else came.
[285.96] Aunt was telling me that
[287.56] Annie took admission somewhere,
[289.40] she is learning how to stitch,
[294.12] so she went there.
[295.40] Aunt came alone.
[296.64] Really?
[298.36] Do one thing, think once more.
[304.88] Did anyone else come with her?
[306.72] No Afnan,
[307.80] I told you aunt came.
[309.68] Why are you asking me 
again and again?
[311.08] Because you are lying to me.
[313.16] What do you think?
[314.72] I will not find out whatever
 is happening at home?
[317.32] I know well, even Shani came.
[319.48] Why did he come here?
[320.52] No, no, Afnan.
[321.44] There is nothing like that.
[322.12] Shani didn’t come here.
[327.32] Aunt was saying that
[328.76] Shani or uncle will come
 pick her up.
[330.96] It is possible that Shani would
 have to come pick her.
[333.00] I didn’t see him.
[334.36] He didn’t come in front of me.
[335.96] Hear me out clearly.
[338.76] I shouldn’t see Shani in this home
[341.68] or else I will not tolerate it.
[343.36] And tell everyone on 
that home as well.
[440.52] Rasheeda.
[443.52] Please make something good
 and spicy to eat today.
[445.32] I really want to have 
something spicy.
[447.88] Do you hear me?
[449.00] Make something really spicy.
[451.32] Don’t make tasteless, 
useless food, please.
[453.84] Yes, madam Alizay, I will try.
[456.44] Don’t try,
[457.52] you have to cook well.
[459.12] I don’t know what has 
happened to you,
[460.36] why have you suddenly started
 to make such tasteless food?
[466.80] What happened?
[467.52] Why are you so worried?
[469.48] Madam Ramsha, you know
 madam Alizay’s anger.
[473.24] Since she has become pregnant,
[474.40] her anger has increased.
[476.68] Now she wants to have
 something spicy,
[478.88] that too with good taste.
[480.68] I try my best to make 
something good for her,
[482.96] but she doesn’t like it.
[484.36] Look, the condition 
she is in right now,
[486.72] in it, the taste changes.
[490.04] Okay tell  me,
[490.96] what does she want to have?
[491.80] I will cook it.
[493.52] You have made it easy for me.
[495.60] Come on, I will tell you
[496.88] what needs to be made.
[497.44] Come on.
[510.92] Listen,
[511.68] you cooked really good food today.
[513.60] I really liked the biryani.
[515.32] Yes, honestly.
[516.48] The minced meat and 
kebabs were really delicious.
[519.48] Sister, I didn’t cook food today,
[520.96] madam Ramsha did.
[554.12] Madam Alizay wanted to have 
something spicy today,
[556.72] so madam Ramsha said,
[558.84] she will prepare it. 
Whatever was cooked,
[559.92] was made by madam Ramsha.
[578.08] She cooked the food today 
with a lot of effort.
[585.36] What is the effort in this?
[587.20] After all,
[588.12] I am free all day long.
[603.56] If I went into the kitchen for 
a little while,
[605.04] then what is the big deal in it, huh?
[616.04] Yes, true.
[617.68] After all,
[619.40] Ramsha has nothing to do.
[628.16] You did good that
[629.12] you took care of the work in the kitchen.
[641.76] Aunt, by the way,
[642.96] since Alizay took an off from her office,
[660.16] even Alizay has nothing to do.
[693.96] But the difference between 
Ramsha and Alizay is that
[696.88] Ramsha takes care of everyone.
[725.96] This is her love for all of us that
[728.96] she cared about Alizay’s feelings.
[753.16] She cooked the food she wanted to have.
[770.56] You two should have at 
least thanked Ramsha,
[773.36] but no issues,
[774.76] I will do it.
[802.92] Thank you, Ramsha.
[821.84] Thank you so much.
[959.24] Annie is calling.
[961.52] Hello Annie,
[962.40] how are you?
[964.20] What happened Annie? 
Why are you crying?
[967.04] What?
[968.24] Uncle had an accident.
[970.36] Okay. Okay, stop crying Annie.
[972.32] I am coming. I am coming.
[973.84] Stop crying.
[974.64] I am telling you I am coming. Okay.
[984.00] Hey.
[984.44] I am so sorry aunt. I am so sorry.
[986.44] Watch where you are going.
[988.24] Where are you going
 in such a hurry?
[989.64] Where are you going?
[990.44] Uncle had an accident, Annie called.
[992.64] I have been calling Afnan for so long,
[994.60] but he is not answering,
[995.52] so I am going myself.
[997.20] Aunt, as soon as Afnan,
[998.56] you tell him I went to uncle’s home.
[1000.64] Yes, yes, I will tell him.
[1003.00] Aunt, please tell him
[1004.36] or else he will worry.
[1005.76] Obviously,
[1006.56] what is there to forget in this,
[1007.44] you go without worrying.
[1008.56] Okay fine. Thank you. Bye.
[1022.56] Aunt,
[1023.80] how are you talking to my aunt?
[1026.76] Now you will tell me
[1028.68] what I should say to someone?
[1033.32] The guests who come to the home
[1034.72] of cultured people are respectable.
[1036.76] You don’t insult them.
[1039.12] Ramsha, hear one thing clearly,
[1042.20] no relative of yours
[1044.76] will come to my home now.
[1048.24] Why?
[1049.80] I am Afnan’s wife.
[1051.32] I have a full right on this home,
[1055.68] so my relatives will
 surely come here.
[1061.12] Aunt, you come with me.
[1077.20] Hey, Ramsha, child,
[1078.32] you are worried for no reason.
[1079.84] I had a minor accident.
[1097.96] That’s why I had told
[1098.96] you not to call Ramsha,
[1100.28] she would get worried.
[1101.80] Why did Annie call her?
[1111.00] I really got worried hearing 
about your accident.
[1128.04] I couldn’t understand what
 I should said.
[1130.36] So I told Annie to call Ramsha,
[1132.96] so she called Ramsha.
[1148.24] Thank God,
[1149.36] the bone didn’t break
[1150.28] or else we would have had to 
get an operation done.
[1158.24] Thank God.
[1159.96] He has been kind.
[1171.28] Should I make porridge for you?
 You should eat porridge.
[1188.00] You know honestly,
[1190.68] the porridge Ramsha makes,
[1193.88] no one else can make it.
[1210.16] You mother and daughter 
don’t have the taste...
[1212.36] ... that Ramsha has in her hands.
[1219.96] She has the same taste 
as sister in law.
[1227.08] You are right about that.
[1239.88] Sister in law knew how
 to make everything
[1242.24] so well and Ramsha has
 learned everything from her.
[1260.16] Uncle,
[1261.12] I will make porridge for you.
[1262.76] Hey, Ramsha, child.
[1264.52] I didn’t mean that at all.
[1266.04] Leave it.
[1281.28] You have come tired.
[1282.96] You still have to go back home.
[1284.64] I am not tired at all.
[1286.16] I will go make porridge for you,
[1287.72] after that I will go home.
[1291.12] Okay.
[1292.84] I will go make it.
[1298.64] She is such an affectionate child,
[1300.96] she has always cared a lot for us.
[1310.40] We were unworthy,
[1312.80] we didn’t realize her worth
[1324.84] or else our Ramsha
[1326.12] would have been living 
with us in this home.
[1338.60] I will go check,
[1339.72] she must be working 
alone in the kitchen.
[1349.28] Ramsha. How dare you?
[1353.00] You dared to come back to this home.
[1358.24] Get out of here.
[1360.44] Get out.
[1362.16] You are dead for us.
[1363.72] What are you saying?
[1365.24] I am absolutely right sister in law.
[1367.40] The consequence of what ...
[1370.24] she has done is that we 
take her life right now.
[1374.88] Don’t say that.
[1377.16] Uncle,
[1378.12] you can kill me,
[1380.24] but I will not go anywhere from here.
[1382.24] Ramsha did you not hear what I said?
[1384.96] Get out. Get out of here.
[1386.76] Uncle, please listen…
[1388.28] Don’t.
[1389.92] Don’t call me your uncle.
[1392.48] I am dead for you.
[1400.36] That…
[1401.84] Papa. Papa. Uncle, papa...
[1413.48] Shameless girl.
[1416.20] Because of you…
[1418.32] because of you
[1420.56] my father like brother has 
left me and gone.
[1424.56] Because of you.
[1425.84] You are a murderer.
[1427.04] You are your father’s murderer.
[1432.12] I shouldn’t see you here.
[1433.40] Take her from here. Take her.
[1435.48] One minute. Anwar,
[1436.76] you be quiet.
[1437.60] This is not the time to say these things.
[1439.44] I said, I don’t want to see her here.
[1441.12] Get lost. Take her from here.
[1442.56] Child, go inside.
[1444.04] Ramsha, go inside, child.
[1445.96] Come on.
[1450.40] A disobedient child has no right to
[1452.56] see the face of their dead father.
[1453.96] Take her inside. Take her.
[1455.64] No.
[1457.48] No, no, uncle,
[1458.56] don’t torment me like this.
[1461.24] Let me see my father’s face.
[1464.88] All of you know
[1467.72] how much papa used to love me.
[1471.68] When everyone rejected me,
[1477.08] that’s when my father hugged me.
[1481.88] No one can stop me from 
seeing my father’s face.
[1484.32] She is committing a sin.
[1485.48] Stop it. People are watching.
[1486.48] She is committing a sin.
[1487.32] Be patient.
[1488.16] After that she is arguing with me.
[1489.76] She killed my brother.
[1491.96] She is a sinner.
[1493.32] Papa, please.
[1500.52] Ramsha.
[1512.92] Are you still upset with me?
[1518.60] Why?
[1524.28] We don’t have a relation that
[1526.08] you ask me if I am upset
 and you convince me.
[1545.60] Whatever I did with you was wrong.
[1551.28] Oh wow,
[1553.08] it is good that you realized it.
[1563.84] Did you not realize it soon, Shani?
[1576.12] But you know,
[1578.36] now this realization is 
of no use for you,
[1580.64] nor is it of any use for me.
[1591.04] That’s why it is better that
[1591.96] you bury this realization inside you.
[1596.48] I regret losing you.
[1611.88] You know Shani,
[1613.92] when you don’t realize on time,
[1618.88] then just like that, this realization
[1621.36] becomes regret and sorrow.
[1629.32] You are absolutely right.
[1643.52] But despite that if possible,
 please forgive me.
[1658.48] I am embarrassed.
[1661.28] What is the point of this 
embarrassment, Shani?
[1664.88] Why were you not 
embarrassed at the time
[1666.44] when you tortured me
 every moment?
[1676.48] Why were you not embarrassed
[1679.80] when you made fun of 
my helplessness?
[1690.96] You even snatched the roof 
from over my head.
[1699.40] Along with your life,
[1700.72] you dragged me out of this home too,
[1703.44] why were not embarrassed then?
[1719.48] I forgive you, Shani.
[1731.36] I didn’t forgive you
[1733.28] because my heart became soft,
[1742.72] in fact, I forgave you because
[1745.16] I don’t want to keep any relation
 with a man like you.
[1759.64] Neither hatred, nor revenge.
[1799.56] Brother has done something cheap,
[1800.92] he shouldn’t have taken the money…
[1804.84] You cannot keep a secret, right?
[1814.28] I had told you not to tell anyone
[1816.36] . Don’t you understand?
[1818.20] You should be ashamed brother.
[1828.76] You have lost your mind so much 
in your craze to go out
[1831.32] that you don’t care about 
your respect and honor.
[1839.56] I want to live with you.
[1841.84] Both of us will go there 
and start a new life.
[1845.64] Only you and I will be in that life.
[1849.12] No third person will be there.
[1851.08] We will leave behind all the bitterness
 and regrets of our past here.
[1856.32] We will start a new life.
[1859.96] I want to live with you.
[1862.64] I want to live my life with you, Shani.
[1867.24] Ramsha, have you gone mad
[1868.88] that I take you to Dubai with me?
[1871.64] I cannot tolerate you here.
[1873.48] I don’t want to see your face,
[1874.84] this is why I want to go to Dubai
[1876.04] and you are saying that 
I take you along with me?
[1891.52] Stop.
[1893.76] If you want that I drag you out of the
[1895.56] house in front of the neighbours,
[1897.08] then I will do that.
[1898.36] Why are you so merciless?
[1904.12] If I don’t come to this home,
[1905.64] then where will I go, Shani?
[1906.52] This is my home.
[1912.04] You are my husband,
[1913.12] I am your wife.
[1917.44] You are dragging me out of my home.
[1921.00] Look Shani,
[1922.24] even after so much happened,
[1923.80] I came back to this home,
[1925.36] only for you.
[1926.92] So that I can live my life with you.
[1929.16] If you distance me from yourself,
[1930.64] then I will die.
[1931.28] Don’t drive me mad.
[1932.76] I am telling you,
[1933.76] you are making me so 
angry right now,
[1936.00] I will say something that
[1937.68] you will not be able to come 
to this home in future.
