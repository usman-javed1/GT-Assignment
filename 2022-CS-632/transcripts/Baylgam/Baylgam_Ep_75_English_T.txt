[22.12] Are you leaving?
[24.52] Yes. Obviously.
[28.28] Now this is not my mother’s home,
[30.24] that I can live here.
[33.64] People are right,
[36.36] the parents’ home is the one
[37.44] where the parents are alive.
[41.48] And now this is no longer
my in-laws home,
[44.96] so I will have to go.
[48.60] How long can I stay at
the home of relatives?
[52.80] Ramsha.
[57.64] Don’t worry.
[61.20] You know,
[63.56] whether I live in this
home or not,
[67.64] I will surely live in your heart.
[74.04] I had thought that after your
marriage with brother,
[77.24] we would always live together.
[81.04] I didn’t know all this would happen.
[112.00] I wish I could do something you child.
[118.20] All that you have done for
me after mama left,
[123.28] is enough, aunt.
[128.24] Child, if you go to Mr. Qasim’s home,
[131.72] then I will be satisfied.
[133.84] No aunt,
[135.96] I don’t want to go back to his home
[137.04] and become a burden on him again.
[145.08] I will live alone.
[148.40] I will stand up on my feet myself.
[152.60] How do you make such big
decisions, child?
[158.60] When everything is impossible
in a person’s life,
[163.32] then it is easy to make
difficult decisions.
[168.52] May God always make you have
this strength and courage.
[174.92] I pray that you always get success
and happiness.
[178.12] Amen.
[181.36] Come here.
[188.20] Ramsha, child,
[190.64] I couldn’t do anything else for you,
[196.08] just keep this.
[197.68] No aunt.
[199.64] I don’t want money.
[202.52] I don’t want to live on anyone
else’s support.
[208.80] How long will I take support
from everyone?
[211.36] Whatever I have to do,
I will do it for myself.
[214.32] I will stand up on my feet.
[217.00] Just remember me
in your prayers.
[278.60] You will come to meet us,
right?
[281.88] No.
[284.92] I will never come back to
this home again.
[291.88] But…
[292.72] but if you want to meet me,
[294.64] then you can come.
[296.48] I will give you my address.
[298.56] Aunt,
[300.20] I will give you, your address,
[301.72] you come with Annie to meet me.
[304.84] Yes, child. Why not?
[445.52] Oh God.
[446.36] Mama,
[447.32] I was just going to change.
[448.96] The video has been made.
[450.12] You know,
[450.92] I have gone crazy searching
for this suit.
[453.64] And damn this video of yours.
[456.96] This passion of yours has
made me go mad.
[459.56] I pray to God that you don’t get
a single like on this video.
[462.84] Fear God.
[463.92] I have dressed up so much and
[465.24] I wont get any likes on Tik Tok.
[466.48] Mama, don’t say that.
Take back your curse, mama.
[468.76] With whose permission
did you put on this suit?
[470.88] If you would have put
a small stain on it, then
[473.12] Tabassum would have
become really upset.
[474.52] And if she finds out
that you wore it,
[477.16] then all hell will break loose.
[478.32] Who will tell her?
[479.44] Who will tell her? No one, right.
[480.84] And you don’t worry so much,
[482.28] she wont find out.
[483.16] I wore it for ten minutes,
it did wear out.
[485.20] I will make another Tik Tok,
[486.48] then I will go change…
[487.72] Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare.
[496.52] Hey, child, your mother is right.
[499.04] If you don’t eat anything,
[500.00] then how will you get fine? Huh?
[501.56] Drink the soup quickly.
Come on.
[503.04] I had told mama
[504.36] I don’t want to drink soup,
[505.84] still she prepared it
and brought it.
[509.12] If you don’t want to have soup,
[510.08] then what will my daughter have?
[514.04] Zinger burger.
[515.60] Don’t you dare.
[516.72] Don’t you dare feed her
a zinger burger.
[520.28] She is in this condition because
of eating food from outside.
[523.88] She will just have soup.
[525.40] Yes, Kulsoom is absolutely right.
[527.32] You do one thing,
you have this soup, child a
[529.36] nd as you drink it,
I will quietly bring you the burger.
[531.96] Okay?
[532.92] What? What?
[533.60] What are you father
and daughter…
[534.60] No, nothing. You leave.
[536.20] You leave it.
[536.92] I will feed my daughter
the soup with my own hands.
[539.44] You, go.
[547.64] Hey my parents chose
your father for me.
[552.16] I didn’t even see him before marriage.
[555.16] Oh man.
[557.24] If you had seen him before marriage,
[559.00] then you wouldn’t have had to
go through all this today.
[561.48] Ramsha..
[562.24] I mean, mama,
[563.52] every girl wishes that
[566.12] she gets a good and
handsome boy.
[569.00] Now, no one selects
someone with a belly.
[571.76] Look at Papa.
[573.16] Your father was not like
this since the start,
[575.36] and neither did he have a belly.
[579.04] Your father was really handsome
before marriage.
[581.80] Uh-huh, handsome, huh?
[591.28] Mehnaz,
[592.88] this is the same Ramsha, right?
[595.44] She grew up so quickly.
[598.52] I remember the day the nurse put
a doll in my arms in the hospital,
[602.88] and said that sir,
you had a daughter
[605.16] and I thanked God,
[607.56] that God, thank You,
[609.68] you sent blessings in our home.
[611.72] Hey, you ask me
[613.44] who has tolerated her
every single day.
[615.76] Your daughter has grown
up after difficulty.
[617.76] Do you see that?
[618.64] Do you hear her?
[619.56] She tolerates me daily.
[621.36] It is good you heard it yourself today.
[622.76] No, no, child,
[623.44] your mother really loves you.
[625.16] She is just joking.
[626.76] I know that.
[627.80] Mama loves me the most.
[631.52] Yes, papa, I am coming.
[635.32] Here you go, your light.
[636.76] You brought it!
[637.76] You are so good. Thank you.
[639.72] How is it possible that my daughter
makes a wish and I don’t fulfill it.
[643.00] Thank you, papa.
[643.88] What was the need to bring this?
[645.92] You fulfill all her wishes.
[648.04] This love and affection of
yours has spoiled her.
[651.84] I have one daughter, madam,
[654.12] if I don’t care for her wishes,
[655.72] then would I care about the
wishes of the neighbours?
[660.28] Why are you looking at me like this?
[661.96] Do you want something?
[663.60] I am seeing daughters are so good.
[671.08] You bring food for me daily
early in the morning.
[679.64] You care for me all day long.
[686.36] You don’t frown even once.
[689.72] You are the same one to
[692.84] whom I would ask to do something,
[696.08] you would get upset.
[701.00] But now,
[704.12] you seem so smart.
[816.80] Annie,
[819.12] make tea for Shani.
[822.08] When he wakes up,
he will immediately want tea.
[825.16] Mama,
[827.32] you and papa are serving
brother so well like
[830.24] he fought a battle and came.
[837.00] First, he did what he wanted,
[838.60] then he wasted all the money
and came back.
[841.20] Hey,
[843.32] he got cheated.
[844.80] He said his friends cheated him.
[854.76] He didn’t know this
would happen with him.
[862.84] Now if he is going through
bad times,
[864.72] if the family doesn’t support him,
then who will?
[869.00] Even Ramsha was going
through bad times, right?
[876.32] Then why did you drag her out?
[878.04] Annie, there is no point
of this argument now.
[886.12] She mourning had ended,
[887.60] she had to leave this home one day.
[890.96] She had to leave mama.
[892.44] She surely had to go.
[894.56] But not the way you people
dragged her out of this home.
[899.32] Okay, you make tea.
[906.52] I will go see who it is.
You go and make tea.
[922.52] Yes, are you fine?
[924.36] I was missing Ramsha,
[926.68] so I thought I would meet her.
[928.76] You inform her that I have come.
[949.28] That’s it. Stop here.
[951.44] That’s it, brother.
[953.04] Thank you.
[957.20] Here is your money.
[1010.68] Why are they not opening the door?
[1031.72] Hello.
[1033.04] Yes, Anum,
[1033.64] I am outside your home,
[1034.76] open the door.
[1035.96] Ramsha, I am in the car right now
[1037.20] and I am going to Mirpur.
[1038.96] Mama called in the morning,
[1040.28] papa is really unwell.
[1050.24] He had a heart attack,
[1051.88] and I am sorry, I forgot to inform you.
[1053.24] I left in a haste.
[1055.04] Oh no,
[1056.72] may God have mercy.
[1058.76] I was standing outside your home,
[1061.24] now where will I go, Anum?
[1062.68] Sorry Ramsha,
[1063.96] but please, you make some
other arrangement.
[1071.76] I am really worried right now,
[1073.36] I will talk to you later.
[1076.56] Anum, I…right now…hello?
[1186.88] You should have at least informed.
[1189.40] You should have called me,
[1190.88] I would have come to get her.
[1204.04] How can you be so careless
in the matters of a girl?
[1208.36] I wanted to call you and inform you,
[1210.76] but Ramsha strictly told me not to.
What could I do?
[1225.08] You didn’t do what
you should have done.
[1229.80] I was helpless.
[1233.28] You are not helpless,
this is your selfishness.
[1250.08] Tell me,
[1251.68] if your own daughter
was in Ramsha’s place,
[1253.76] then would you have done this?
[1266.84] A lonely girl and this society.
[1269.56] You have an idea how many
animals exist in this society.
[1285.52] Today, if I tell you
[1286.40] to hand your daughter
over to this society,
[1288.24] then would you do this?
[1294.40] Dad, leave it.
[1297.76] There is no need to say
so much to these people.
[1300.56] If they cared about Ramsha,
[1302.44] they wouldn’t have let her go alone.
[1316.20] I will call her.
[1317.84] We will find out where she is.
[1330.80] She is not answering her call.
[1332.48] Look,
[1333.36] whatever friend she went to,
[1335.12] you must have her number,
[1336.44] some home address.
[1337.44] Please tell us that. At least,
[1338.84] we will be satisfied that
 Ramsha is fine.
[1342.56] Annie knows.
[1344.20] She has the number. I will find out.
[1346.84] Please, quickly.
[1350.72] This is the limit to being careless.
[1352.84] Meaning,
[1354.76] had we not come here like this, then
[1356.52] we would not have found out.
[1358.36] Dad, relax. Please.
[1419.96] Greetings.
[1421.36] Find out who this girl is.
[1423.16] Why is she sitting here?
[1425.12] Yes, I will ask her.
[1439.72] Madam, why are you sitting here?
[1443.32] Who do you want to meet?
[1447.60] Are you not ashamed?
[1449.64] You are begging wearing
such good clothes.
[1452.64] I am not a beggar.
[1454.64] I know girls like you well.
[1457.64] You wear good clothes,
[1458.96] you hold a good bag,
[1460.00] you cry about your poverty
and helplessness
[1462.24] and take hefty money
from respectable people.
[1465.32] This is your profession.
[1467.04] Have you lost your mind?
[1468.80] I have not come here to
take money from anyone.
[1470.52] Yes, then why were
you sitting here?
[1471.84] Yes, so it is forbidden to sit here?
[1473.76] Do one thing,
[1474.56] put up a board here stating ‘
[1475.68] You cannot sit here’. Okay?
[1478.24] Look at that,
[1479.16] first you steal and then
you blame me.
[1480.88] I am not a thief.
[1482.52] Mind what you say.
[1484.08] Madam,
[1484.88] teach me manners later.
[1486.48] Come on, leave from here.
[1487.72] Cheap man.
[1488.76] He has no shame.
[1489.72] Hey, madam…
[1491.68] People nowadays have no humanity.
[1507.08] Child, if you go to Mr. Qasim’s home,
[1509.88] then I will be satisfied.
[1512.52] No aunt,
[1514.88] I don’t want to go back to his home
[1515.88] and become a burden on him again.
[1519.16] I will live alone.
[1522.36] I will stand up on my feet myself.
[1525.60] How do you make such
big decisions, child?
[1532.08] Ramsha, I am in the car right now
[1533.52] and I am going to Mirpur.
[1535.00] Mama called in the morning,
[1536.60] papa is really unwell.
[1538.52] He had a heart attack, and
[1540.16] I am sorry, I forgot to inform you.
[1541.60] I left in a haste.
[1543.88] Sorry Ramsha,
[1545.00] but please, you make some
other arrangement.
[1547.84] I am really worried right now,
[1549.56] I will talk to you later.
[1555.76] You are begging wearing
such good clothes.
[1558.44] I am not a beggar.
[1560.52] I know girls like you well.
[1563.44] You wear good clothes,
[1564.88] you hold a good bag,
[1565.88] you cry about your poverty
and helplessness
[1568.04] and take hefty money
from respectable people.
[1570.96] This is your profession.
[1572.92] Have you lost your mind?
[1574.68] I have not come here to take
money from anyone.
[1576.48] Yes, then why were
you sitting here?
[1577.76] Yes, so it is forbidden to sit here?
[1579.68] Do one thing,
[1580.44] put up a board here stating
[1581.68] ‘You cannot sit here’. Okay?
[1584.20] Look at that,
[1585.20] first you steal and then
you blame me.
[1604.64] Dad, Ramsha’s number is off.
[1609.28] That child has a lot of self-respect.
[1611.60] She knows we will contact her,
[1613.96] so she turned off her number.
[1616.60] She wants that we are not able
to do anything for her.
[1620.68] She doesn’t want to take
a favor from us, that’s why
[1623.60] she didn’t tell anyone anything.
[1626.44] Afnan, it is my fault,
[1628.72] I should have stayed updated on her.
[1631.76] God have mercy on this child,
[1634.80] save her from any further tests.
[1638.24] Call that friend of hers,
[1640.52] whose number you had.
[1641.64] Dad, I am calling constantly,
[1643.28] but it is out of reach.
[1646.84] That cousin of Ramsha,
[1648.12] what was her name?
[1649.28] Annie
[1649.88] Yes. Yes. She had told
you the address, right?
[1651.76] So let’s go there. Come on.
[1653.36] Sure dad.
[1711.36] Hey look, there is Ramsha.
[1713.00] Stop. Stop the car.
[1731.00] Greeting uncle.
[1732.88] Don’t call me uncle.
[1735.00] You are nothing to me,
[1736.28] you and I have no relation.
[1742.76] If you and I had a relation,
[1745.08] you would have at least informed
me before leaving home.
[1748.00] You didn’t trust me at all.
[1753.36] You didn’t consider
me worthy of it, Ramsha.
[1755.92] It is not that,
[1757.44] I just didn’t want to worry you.
[1759.64] You have worried me.
[1767.60] We are looking for you
all around the city.
[1768.92] We are worried.
[1774.28] Now will I ask you to sit in the car or
[1776.60] do you not intend on doing this?
[1777.88] If you don’t intend on it, then fine.
[1779.00] Let the little respect I have remain.
[1781.24] Pick up her bag, man.
[1821.36] Okay.
[1822.32] Okay, I will talk to you. Okay.
[1826.16] Alizay.
[1827.56] Yes?
[1827.80] Where is Afnan? I don’t see him.
[1830.60] Mama, how would I know where he is.
[1833.48] What sort of a wife are you?
[1834.68] You don’t know where
your husband is,
[1836.68] who is he with?
[1839.08] Mama, I am his wife,
[1840.48] not a spy
[1841.36] that I would know where he is,
 what is he doing.
[1843.56] Hey wives have to be spies.
[1846.84] You should know who he is with,
[1849.16] when he will come home.
[1850.96] You know,
[1851.60] when your papa would 
get last from the office,
[1854.04] then I would know 
why he has gotten late,
[1856.72] when will he come home,
[1858.00] who is he with at that time.
[1859.36] And you are acting so carefree.
[1863.84] Where is brother?
[1865.40] I don’t know.
[1867.96] Greetings.
[1870.56] Greetings.
[1872.08] Alizay, Afsheen,
[1873.88] meet her,
[1875.72] this is my daughter, Ramsha.
[1883.44] She has come back to her home,
[1884.76] and from now on, 
she will live in her home.
[1894.64] Come on, child. Come on.
[1896.16] Come to your room. Come on. Come.
[1945.48] So she is responsible for it, Afnan.
[1947.96] If she got married to Shani, then
[1950.04] she should have compromised 
and lived with him.
[1953.04] After all,
[1953.72] Shani accepted her after
 so much happened.
[1957.72] Who marries such girls?
[1973.56] What happened?
 Why are you looking at me like that?
[1976.28] You too rejected her.
[1984.88] Yes.
[1988.48] Maybe that was the
 biggest mistake of my life.
[1997.76] Alizay, what happened to you?
[2001.64] Afnan, what is uncle saying?
[2004.04] Ramsha will live with 
us in this home?
[2006.80] I don’t understand
[2008.36] how he can even say this.
[2009.88] Hey, what is there to 
understand in this?
[2012.52] It is dad’s decision,
[2013.88] he said she would stay, 
so she will stay.
[2016.16] But how can she live in this
 home as our family member?
[2020.68] Look, neither is this my decision,
[2022.92] nor can I say anything to dad on this.
[2031.96] It is his home,
[2033.16] it is his will,
[2034.12] he can keep who he wants at this home,
[2035.36] he can drag out whoever he wants.
[2037.16] Yes, so this is a home,
[2038.20] not a hotel that
[2039.44] anyone will come and stay.
[2041.36] Look at you, you are so relaxed.
[2045.60] In fact, you must be happy, right?
[2047.68] Ramsha is here.
[2050.24] Look, don’t talk nonsense with me.
[2058.48] Alizay, what sort of 
a person are you?
[2061.36] You should see someone else with the
 eyes of humanity for a change.
[2073.44] You know well,
[2074.40] Ramsha is going 
through tough times,
[2078.28] she needs support 
of her own at this time,
[2080.52] that’s why dad made this decision.
[2084.80] Afnan, who is her own here,
 in this home?
[2088.96] Her own dragged her 
out of her home,
[2092.28] now why is she coming 
to this home?
[2096.28] If you want to argue,
 then go do it with dad.
[2098.52] I cannot do anything in this matter.
[2119.76] Madam, Ramsha,
[2120.84] I felt bad hearing about you.
[2123.12] My heart sank hearing
 about your divorce.
[2131.44] People call women 
who get divorced in young age bad.
[2141.52] Madam Ramsha, don’t mind
 what I am saying,
[2144.48] I am talking about 
the behavior of people.
[2152.72] You are really good,
[2154.04] despite this,
[2154.96] those people didn’t care for you.
[2161.80] I would say,
[2163.28] something like this should happen 
with their daughter as well.
[2165.68] As you sow, so shall you reap.
[2168.20] God forbid, Tabassum. 
What are you saying?
[2175.24] God forbid that any girl has
 to face what I had to face.
[2180.36] May God keep all girls
 happy with their husbands.
[2185.32] Whatever has happened with me,
[2188.84] I am sure God has something 
better planned for me.
[2192.32] Madam Ramsha,
[2193.40] I have seen when girls get divorced,
[2196.52] they curse their in-laws.
[2199.12] You are talking about their betterment.
[2201.68] When you are hurt, 
it gets a little difficult to be patient.
[2206.12] It is good that
[2207.16] you came back to this home.
[2208.88] The life of this home has returned.
[2220.40] By the way, madam Alizay spends 
her entire day in the office
[2225.20] and madam Afsheen
[2226.32] spends most of the day out of home.
[2232.20] I didn’t want to come back to this home.
