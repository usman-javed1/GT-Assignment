[20.68] Greetings.
[23.36] Greetings.
[26.76] Hey wow, uncle, you went shopping.
[29.36] Yes, I had to get some things of need,
that’s it.
[36.88] Tabassum, call madam Ramsha.
[40.12] Okay, sure.
[55.84] Hey, come. Come.
[57.32] Greetings.
[59.00] Child, I brought some clothes and
things of need for you.
[66.88] Hey, uncle, there is no need for that,
you are worried for me for no reason.
[71.80] Hey, what is there to worry in this, child?
[76.68] And don’t call me uncle,
[79.16] be a little informal with me.
[85.20] I have made your mother, my sister.
[90.60] Fine, I will try uncle.
[92.76] Hey, you are being formal again.
[101.64] Fine, uncle.
[103.16] Live long. Live long.
[106.40] See if you like the things.
[141.32] I feel that uncle has found
his lost daughter.
[145.68] You know brother,
[148.16] he is empathetic with people like this.
[151.96] Mama, I don’t know anything,
[153.96] you call and ask Afnan to come back.
[158.40] He will handle this situation.
[160.76] Hey,
[162.08] you will worry Afnan for something
so small?
[169.80] He anyway went for work,
[172.12] I don’t think you should disturb him.
[179.88] Okay tell me, what problem
do you have that girl?
[185.20] Why?
[186.08] Don’t you have a problem with that girl?
[190.08] I have a problem,
[191.76] but not that much that I put myself
in a problem because of her.
[201.08] Alizeh, her mother is unwell.
[202.96] When she gets fine,
she will leave from here.
[207.48] Mama, her mother is in a coma,
[209.72] and you don’t know how long it takes
a person to recover from a coma.
[213.00] Some people take days, some months
and some even take years.
[218.64] I know brother has loved you
so much from the start
[222.60] and he has always given you value.
[224.80] Now you are unable to tolerate that
he gives value to someone else in your place,
[229.00] that is why you are getting so hyper.
[231.68] Mama, I don’t know all this.
[233.68] But I don’t like that someone else
calls uncle, uncle apart from me.
[238.92] My love, he is your uncle and
he will stay that way.
[243.16] If brother has made that woman
her sister out of sympathy
[247.36] so what is wrong in that?
[250.48] Come on.
[276.68] Uncle, can I sit with you here?
[279.84] Sit. Greetings.
Greetings.
[287.96] Uncle,
[291.00] you offer Namaz,
[293.28] please pray to God for me.
[296.24] Fine,
[297.96] I will pray for you too.
[299.24] Tell me, do you want me to pray
about something special.
[302.60] Pray to God that he gives me peace.
[308.24] You want peace?
[312.72] Hearts find peace with the mention of God.
[320.44] You mention God, talk to Him.
[327.00] You will see,
[328.72] you will also find peace and
happiness too.
[335.60] I have seen you pray regularly.
[340.08] You don’t miss a single prayer, right?
[343.68] I try, child. It is His order.
[350.56] It is a way to remember him.
[361.16] You have to try to fulfill God’s orders,
[365.08] but remember one thing,
[368.24] you can delay prayers but not service.
[372.36] He forgives the rights of God,
He is the most forgiving,
[377.16] but there is a lot of questioning
in the matters of His creation.
[387.64] You need to be really careful
in these matters,
[392.08] rest, he is really forgiving.
The most forgiving.
[403.72] He loves us more than
seventy mothers.
[410.56] You are right.
[412.92] I will follow it.
[416.60] A man just makes intentions,
[418.92] God gives them the will.
Everything gets fine.
[422.68] Yes.
[426.12] I think you really like flowers.
[429.68] Hey, yes,
[432.12] I love every creation of God,
[436.28] but my son really likes
these flowers and gardening.
[440.52] You have a son too?
[442.76] Yes,
[444.28] he has gone to Islamabad
for business.
[448.12] He will be back in a day or two.
[450.72] Did you talk to the doctor?
[463.28] Yes, God cures,
may He give her health.
[475.20] You pray.
[479.80] If you pray with your heart,
God will hear it.
[483.08] She is my sister,
may God give her health.
[492.48] Don’t worry.
[494.96] If your heart is feeling sad,
then call out to Him.
[499.04] He listens, He knows it all.
[502.04] He lives in the heart.
[506.96] Talk to him about what is in your heart,
[509.20] He listens. He listens to everyone.
[540.76] What?
[541.92] But uncle had told me that he will take me
to the hospital, then how did he go?
[546.12] Hey, why are you constantly
calling him uncle?
[549.92] Relations are only made in blood.
[558.84] If someone makes someone
their niece,
[561.72] or sister, in name, then
it doesn’t become true.
[573.52] This home is a stranger’s home for you,
[575.36] are you a stranger here.
Remember that.
[585.88] It is better that you stay in your room
and stay limited to it.
[594.44] When brother comes,
I will tell you.
[597.24] Now go from here.
[642.56] Aunt.
[653.24] How are you?
[654.32] Yes, I am absolutely fine,
[656.20] but who was this girl.
It was not Alizeh.
[659.96] This is the problem brother
brought to this home.
[667.72] Hey, how can you bring anyone
from the streets home?
[679.04] I mean, what do we know
what family this girl belongs to?
[682.40] Who is she?
[686.96] But who makes brother understand this?
[689.40] Dad gets in trouble
cause of his niceness.
[693.36] No, tell me yourself,
[694.96] how is it possible that this girl
doesn’t have a family.
[698.32] She must have someone,
some maternal or paternal uncle,
[700.92] some cousin, not everyone can die.
Think about it yourself.
[703.56] Aunt, don’t worry, I will talk to dad.
[708.56] I am too much. You just came from
a journey and I started.
[712.08] You must think that aunt…
[713.92] you get fresh,
I will have food served.
[715.84] Fine. Aunt, where is Alizeh?
[718.44] She is in the office,
[720.16] anyway, she should be here by now.
[721.84] You call her, she will come
quicker seeing your call.
[723.96] Fine.
[767.28] What happened madam Ramsha?
What are you looking at?
[772.44] Nothing,
[773.72] whose car has come downstairs?
Did someone come?
[776.96] Little master was going to come,
he must have come.
[780.64] Fine, you leave.
[829.32] Madam Ramsha.
Yes?
[830.76] Did you talk to elder sir?
[833.16] No,
[834.16] I went to talk,
he is sitting with someone.
[837.60] No issues, it must be little master,
you would have gone.
[840.68] It is okay,
[841.72] I will go talk to him later. It didn’t feel
right to disturb him right now.
[888.08] Hey.
[890.32] There are no power failures here,
so what happened now?
[895.40] I will find out. Tabassum.
[900.96] Tabassum.
[908.24] Hey Bashir. What happened?
I am sorry.
[912.44] Did you get hurt.
[914.12] No, that…
[915.36] It was really dark.
[981.12] Ramsha, you?
[987.04] Afnan.
[999.24] What are you doing here?
[1000.96] There was a power failure,
so I went to get a candle.
[1005.44] I had told you to stay in your room.
[1007.64] Now the light is here, leave.
[1010.20] Sure.
[1016.88] Aunt, who was this?
[1018.52] Hey, this is the same girl brother
brought home,
[1021.60] you make her understand one thing,
but she doesn’t understand.
[1125.64] You.
[1127.68] This is my car.
[1130.12] I think you were trying
 to unlock the door.
[1136.56] I dressed up for you.
[1139.76] Really?
[1143.48] But I never asked you to 
dress up so much?
[1146.24] Hey, I thought I would dress 
up for you, you would like it.
[1149.84] Hey, you don’t look good at all.
[1152.28] You know your beauty is in 
your innocence, in your simplicity.
[1156.48] Your innocence…
[1158.20] stay the same,
[1159.32] don’t wear such a heavy 
dress and make up.
[1162.88] Fine, I will be careful next time.
[1175.44] Afnan,
[1176.68] mama and papa are 
looking for a proposal for me.
[1179.04] That is why I have told 
mama the truth about us.
[1182.92] And mama wants that you
 come with a proposal for me with your family.
[1188.28] Really?
[1201.20] So you want that
[1204.32] my family comes to your home
[1209.44] and ask for your proposal?
[1216.76] After today, the two of us wont 
keep any relation with each other.
[1219.96] I made a mistake, I helped you.
[1222.40] It is all my fault.
[1224.72] That’s it.
[1226.04] I am sorry,
[1227.08] I cannot live with this burden.
[1228.72] So I am going.
[1229.40] No Afnan, don’t do this,
[1231.60] I love you and I told mama
[1234.12] and came to meet you.
[1235.24] I want to marry you.
[1236.56] You love me, I love you…
[1238.48] Just shut up!
[1242.60] Hey, you had left your 
parents and come.
[1245.72] You didn’t care 
about their respect,
[1248.36] then how will you 
care about my respect?
[1253.44] Someone who couldn’t 
be their parents,
[1256.32] they can never be mine.
[1258.96] You don’t know the importance 
of relations, Ramsha.
[1262.92] If you care about anything
 it is about you, your happiness,
[1265.76] and I…
[1269.88] and yes, you were saying,
[1272.80] I came out of sympathy, 
I didn’t come because of love.
[1278.04] I sympathized with you, 
and came to help you
[1281.08] so that you can take your 
remaining respect and go home.
[1285.36] But I didn’t know you would 
come as a torment on my head.
[1290.68] Lets forget what happened,
[1292.96] and remember one thing,
[1296.52] you and I cannot get married,
[1302.04] that is why don’t call me after today.
[1312.64] We will not meet.
[1315.04] Take care of yourself. Bye.
[1356.36] What is happening with me?
[1359.96] Whatever path I take 
I meet this person.
[1364.44] Why is this happening?
[1366.92] Why is this happening?
[1377.24] Madam Ramsha, I have washed 
your clothes, should I bring them?
[1382.20] Listen to me.
[1386.36] Will you tell me something?
[1389.08] This Afnan,
[1392.28] what is his relation with this family.
[1394.64] I mean,
[1396.24] what is his relation with uncle?
[1398.88] Madam, what are you saying?
[1400.68] What is his relation?
[1402.12] Mr Afnan is Mr. Qasim’s only son,
[1405.60] this is his home.
[1415.44] Son?
[1419.40] This home belongs to Afnan.
[1421.76] Yes, all okay, madam?
[1425.08] Did Mr. Afnan say something to you?
[1427.24] You look worried.
[1429.40] No. Nothing.
[1431.56] He said nothing. Everything is fine.
[1443.64] Don’t worry because of Mr. Afnan,
[1445.40] you are worrying for no reason.
[1448.72] I have been working 
here for a long time,
[1450.76] little master has a good demeanor,
[1453.56] and why wouldn’t he be?
 Elder master brought him up.
[1466.08] The men of this home are really good.
[1467.84] That is why my grandmother
 worked here,
[1470.36] then my mother
[1472.00] and now I am working.
[1479.40] Even if I get unwell,
[1481.00] these people give me an off.
[1483.36] Madam Ramsha, you don’t worry.
[1509.04] These people may be strangers,
[1510.60] but you are safe here.
[1512.56] Fine, you leave.
[1557.52] What have you come to do here?
[1559.40] Tell me honestly,
[1561.08] you came to take revenge
 with me, right?
[1564.32] There is nothing like that, Afnan.
[1565.68] Stop this nonsense.
[1566.64] I know all this scheming of yours.
[1569.68] All of this happening by
 planning and this
[1571.36] accident was also part of the plan,
 it was part of it.
[1574.96] Have you lost your mind?
[1576.88] I had told you there is nothing 
like that, go from here.
[1578.52] Lower your voice.
[1580.88] This is my home, not yours.
 Do you understand.
[1585.40] And I will never let this plan of 
yours to destroy me be successful.
[1589.84] Hey you even used 
your mother to get me.
[1593.60] I have not seen anyone 
cheap like you.
[1596.48] You are cheap, not me.
[1599.72] You must have used your parents
 to your advantage, I didn’t.
[1622.80] I am so sorry.
[1624.44] What is the problem?
[1627.16] Do you have your eyes
 closed when walking?
[1630.24] Sorry.
[1630.84] and why do you roam 
around the home all day long?
[1633.20] Can you not sit peacefully
 in your room?
[1640.00] What did you think?
[1641.04] This home has been
 put in your name?
[1647.92] if uncle has brought you 
here out of sympathy,
[1650.24] it doesn’t mean that you consider
 this home your ownership.
[1653.32] It is a luxury, don’t get used to it.
[1664.68] I don’t know when her 
mother will get better
[1666.28] and she will leave from here.
[1669.28] Now what are you staring at me for? 
Go from here.
[1673.36] Ill-mannered, illiterate girl.
[1707.60] What has happened child? Tell me.
[1711.40] I want to go to mama, right now.
[1715.20] I am really restless,
[1716.96] please take me to my mama.
[1718.56] Yes, so what is there
 to cry about in this?
[1720.68] I will take you to the 
hospital in the morning.
[1722.44] You go to your room and rest,
[1723.64] we will go in the morning. Okay?
[1725.20] Can I sleep here?
[1729.12] Here?
[1731.76] I am scared alone in my room,
[1735.12] my heart is really restless.
[1736.72] You don’t worry, I will put 
a sheet on the ground and sleep.
[1740.00] No, no, child, this 
is not reasonable.
[1742.84] You do one thing, sit here.
[1744.76] Sit. Sit.
[1746.08] I will do something, okay?
[1781.72] Alizay,
[1784.48] brother is saying that
[1787.20] you let Ramsha sleep 
in your room for one night.
[1807.48] I think she saw a bad dream, so
[1810.16] she is unable to sleep in her room.
[1813.48] What do you mean, mama?
[1815.16] Is she a child,
[1818.28] that she saw a bad dream, and
[1819.88] now she is scared,
 so make her sleep in my room.
[1825.60] Not at all. Sorry.
[1827.08] Say no to uncle.
[1828.44] Alizay, it is just about one night.
[1830.32] No, no, aunty,
 what is wrong with you?
[1832.92] How can you think this?
[1834.36] You know Alizay well.
[1835.92] Alizay cannot share 
her room with anyone.
[1840.16] This is not right.
[1841.36] Hey, Afnan, so you tell me, 
what should I do?
[1844.92] Tabassum hasn’t come either,
[1846.52] had she come,
[1848.24] I would have made her
 sleep in Ramsha’s room.
[1850.20] Mama, my privacy 
gets disturbed.
[1852.08] I am sorry, I cannot sleep 
with someone else.
[1855.84] I can also make her 
sleep in my room, but,
[1860.52] you know I will be 
restless all night.
[1862.68] I cannot guard 
that girl all night.
[1864.84] I don’t trust that girl at all.
[1867.88] What is the issue, mama?
[1869.32] What is this?
[1870.64] First uncle brought her home,
[1876.04] he gave her a separate room
[1877.12] and now you want
 she sleeps in my room.
[1879.24] This is not possible. No.
[1883.28] Alizay.
[1885.76] Mama…
[1916.72] Come in.
[1926.84] Where are you going?
[1928.12] Go lie down over there.
[1929.20] Will you sleep here?
[1934.12] And listen to me,
[1935.40] I don’t like someone else 
touching anything I have.
[1943.48] Okay? Be careful, don’t 
touch anything of mine.
[1946.60] Don’t worry,
[1948.44] wherever you have things kept,
 they will remain there.
[1951.84] I will not bother you.
[2119.92] Afnan.
[2122.40] Why are you not coming 
to have breakfast?
[2124.60] I just didn’t feel like it.
[2127.00] I was thinking that did that
[2129.48] girl who stayed in your room at night,
[2132.60] did she say something weird?
[2136.04] Did she bother you?
[2137.96] What will she say to me?
[2140.84] No, you know,
[2144.76] I couldn’t sleep all
 night cause of this.
[2147.32] So she was with me,
[2149.04] why were you not able to sleep?
[2150.52] What are you worried about?
[2152.52] No, no,
[2153.60] why would I have any worry?
[2155.80] I was just think that
[2157.64] you had told me that
[2159.44] the girl will share the room with you.
[2163.32] What is her name?
[2164.84] Ramsha.
[2165.52] Ramsha. She will share 
a room with you,
[2167.56] you will get disturbed, that’s why.
[2171.12] Why are you so worried, Afnan?
[2173.60] Hey,
[2175.36] why would I not get worried?
[2178.36] Are you and I separate?
[2180.72] If you get disturbed, then
[2182.48] I will also be disturbed.
[2184.88] Come on, Afnan,
[2186.24] I feel you have given way too 
much importance to that girl.
[2188.92] Yes.
[2189.44] Nothing had happened.
[2190.60] I feel all of us are thinking too much,
[2194.08] that girl is not a thief.
[2195.96] Look, if she was a thief,
[2197.32] then something would have been
 stolen from the home till now.
[2200.12] But that didn’t happen.
[2201.80] So leave her,
[2203.68] come on, let’s go 
have breakfast.
[2205.64] Yes, come on.
[2207.56] Okay? Come on.
[2219.36] Uncle you know,
[2222.80] today I felt that mama 
smiled seeing me.
[2227.04] Really? You too felt that?
[2230.56] What do you mean I too felt that?
[2234.00] I too felt that sister Mehnaz smiled.
[2240.36] This means it 
was not my imagination.
[2243.40] Mama was really smiling.
[2252.20] Do you know?
[2254.00] All my worries ended
 seeing mama’s smile.
[2259.36] I have peace in my heart
[2264.24] or else I was so worried,
[2267.16] I felt that my heart will stop.
[2270.12] I will run away somewhere 
from your home.
[2274.88] What happened child?
[2276.48] Did someone say something to you?
[2279.40] No.
[2282.92] You are hiding something.
[2284.84] Or else, why would the
 heart feel this way?
[2287.96] Tell me, did Afsheen
 say something or Alizay?
[2291.16] No uncle, there is nothing like that.
[2293.64] Don’t worry.
[2298.76] Do you trust me?
[2301.56] Yes, but what sort of a question is this?
[2305.84] If I tell you something, 
then will you believe me?
[2309.12] Yes, child,
[2310.64] why wont I believe you?
