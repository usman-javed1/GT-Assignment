[23.76] What happened Afnan?
[30.08] You cannot sleep?
[32.96] You worry about Ramsha so much 
that you cannot even sleep
[48.08] Yes, I am worried about Ramsha
[51.36] but please don’t overthink about it…
[56.00] A person worries about someone,
[58.64] with whom he has a relation!
[60.68] That is not necessary,
[64.84] a person worries about someone 
with whom he is sincere with
[74.08] and wants the best for him as well!
[76.40] Leave it, Afnan!
[78.60] I know very well what your heart 
must be feeling,
[88.28] you cannot tolerate that 
Ramsha is leaving the house!
[100.36] Imagine you fought with uncle 
for Ramsha.
[111.56] you never fought with your father 
for me Afnan!
[126.48] Why are you silent? Speak!
[129.96] I am silent because I don’t want to fight 
with you at this hour of the night,
[144.12] it would be best if you let me be
[153.28] and without arguing go back to sleep.
[206.36] Actually,
[208.92] Mr. Qasim,
[211.20] I am really ashamed!
[226.36] Believe me, I scolded him a lot that day…
[246.64] How dare he came here and talk to you
 in such a manner?
[265.16] I decided that day that 
as soon as I get free,
[268.20] I will bring Shani to you
[270.88] and I will make him ask 
for your forgiveness…
[285.64] There is no need for that.
[301.16] How is it not needed, Mr. Qasim?
[303.64] You are a good man, 
you forgave Shani’s mistake,
[309.24] if it were someone else then 
they would have called the police!
[337.08] Come, apologize to Mr. Qasim!
[340.44] I said it is fine!
[342.56] What am I saying? Elders do say this,
[344.92] but still, get up and apologize!
[356.52] Mr. Qasim, forgive me for that day,
[360.48] I was a bit angry!
[373.16] Child, like I said, it is fine…
[393.32] It is your greatness that
[395.48] you realized your child’s mistake
[412.48] otherwise today’s parents just try 
to hide their children's mistakes.
[427.64] Yes, you are absolutely right!
[436.08] Oh, Salma,
[438.12] you should talk about what is 
in your heart with Mr. Qasim…
[468.88] Mr. Qasim, actually,
[471.68] Salma wanted to request,
[491.32] that since sister-in-law and 
Ramsha left our home,
[496.84] we have lost the happiness 
of our home
[518.72] so Salma wants to take Ramsha, 
the joy of her house back home.
[547.48] Yes, Brother Qasim,
[551.32] we have come here for Ramsha’s proposal
for our Shani,
[573.56] if you find it okay, we would like for you
to talk to Ramsha about it…
[591.68] If you guys came here for this purpose,
[610.24] then I think you guys are 
wasting your time.
[651.88] Actually, don’t worry,
[653.36] we will...
[661.80] answer you once we think about it
[674.08] Yes, yes, of course, 
By the grace of God…
[723.44] The tea is getting cold, 
have some!
[764.16] Ramsha!
[767.00] Congratulations,
[774.32] what happened?
[775.48] Why are you looking at me like this?
[777.20] Don't you know?
[780.00] Why?
[781.68] What happened? I really don’t know.
[784.44] You really don’t know?
[791.12] Your proposal has come from 
your relatives.
[797.16] your uncle and aunt’s son,
[804.60] his proposal has come for you…
[814.32] isn’t it great news?
[816.16] I am so happy for you!
[823.36] What happened? 
Why do you look so sad?
[831.40] Smile,
[833.52] look you already had to 
leave this house,
[836.60] isn’t it better that you are being 
wedded off from this house, hmm?
[842.16] Okay listen,
[844.04] I came to know that your wedding 
was called off before all this as well…
[853.32] it’s a good thing you are getting 
married this time,
[858.84] you should be thankful,
[861.16] by God’s grace,
[864.16] and start your preparations!
[914.32] Brother, I think this is a very 
suitable proposal.
[920.32] Afsheen, I don’t like that boy!
[929.72] The guy who doesn’t know 
how to speak to his elders,
[934.12] doesn’t have basic ethics, 
what shall one say about him?
[946.16] What is the saying, first impression 
is the last impression,
[957.16] he is an ill-mannered and ill-spoken boy.
[961.44] Brother, whatever he did, 
he did it in anger!
[971.24] You know about today’s generation,
[980.88] they are extremely emotionally reactive
 and he apologized to you as well!
[986.88] No Afsheen, my heart is not
satisfied for that boy…
[992.16] Brother, look,
[994.92] Ramsha has been brought up 
in that house,
[1005.60] and her aunt loves her a lot.
[1018.48] look, she can get a mother 
in the form of her aunt!
[1031.48] And a house in the name of in-laws.
[1037.84] what more would Ramsha want?
[1040.12] What could be better for 
Ramsha than this?
[1048.60] Look brother, we also shouldn’t forget 
the fact that Ramsha had a past,
[1066.28] I mean,
[1069.24] look, her video went viral 
around the world.
[1079.12] Brother, look,
[1080.32] honourable people don’t like 
such things!
[1088.80] Look, if you are thinking
[1092.28] that Ramsha will get an extraordinary 
proposal then
[1097.28] that is impossible brother!
[1109.92] If you delay regarding Ramsha’s matter 
then brother,
[1121.92] it will be unjust to my Alizeh.
[1134.32] whatever it is Afsheen,
[1143.48] I can’t take any decision without asking 
Ramsha about her opinion and her intentions.
[1160.64] God has permitted this in our religion!
[1169.64] The girl’s proposal cannot be done 
without her willingness
[1181.36] and she will always have this right!
[1247.16] Where are you going?
[1250.20] I am going to talk to Uncle.
[1252.64] Brother is sleeping,
[1254.80] what do you want to talk about?
[1259.16] What do you think,
[1261.72] if you won’t let me then 
I won’t come to know about it?
[1271.68] Do you have any idea about how brother 
is depressed because of you?
[1283.84] First, you destroyed Afnan 
and Alizeh’s relationship
[1294.28] and now you are making a son 
fight with his father?
[1299.44] No, I never listened to Afnan before
[1302.60] nor will I listen to him in the future!
[1312.04] I just wanted to tell Uncle that 
I am ready to go back into that house.
[1318.04] That would be such a huge favour 
on us from you!
[1327.48] What do you think,
[1329.04] that if you left this house,
[1330.68] will Afnan get rid of you from his heart
[1333.08] and will he be able to forget about you?
[1338.24] Will you lose your connection 
with this house?
[1341.32] I have told this to Alizeh many times
[1343.76] and I am telling you as well,
[1351.96] there is nothing between me 
and Afnan now.
[1358.72] I have forgotten my past and 
moved on in my life!
[1365.08] If you have forgotten your past,
[1367.20] does this mean that people will forget 
your past as well?
[1378.72] Your videos and those pictures of yours 
are just a click away from people!
[1392.28] The disgusting videos and pictures 
you have uploaded,
[1396.60] haven’t left the minds of men yet,
[1406.16] girls like you are not given respect,
[1410.36] and I am surprised
[1413.24] about how brother has still accepted
 you as his daughter!
[1425.52] Do you have any idea
[1427.64] about how many favours brother has done
 on you and your mother?
[1439.92] And what have you given him in return, 
depression?
[1443.20] Separation from his son?
[1454.16] Look, woman,
[1455.92] if you are even a little bit sincere 
with brother
[1459.68] then get married to your cousin
[1471.40] and leave this house forever
[1475.68] and never come back here again!
[1485.56] Leave!
[1523.96] Father, shall I say something?
[1525.32] Hmm…
[1527.56] Mr. Qasim will not agree,
[1537.04] Say something nice for once!
[1540.32] What nice thing shall I say?
[1542.00] Were you not watching, he was looking 
at me as if he wanted to slap me!
[1545.48] Have you seen your behaviour?
[1551.60] You deserve this.
[1555.52] Whatever it is, we shouldn’t have 
gone there.
[1558.40] What has happened?
[1560.48] Afsheen Ma’am said it herself
[1571.28] that she will do something for you.
[1579.92] and it was right in front of you,
[1582.28] she said that they would think 
and give a reply.
[1592.40] if they wanted to refuse, then 
they would have done it there only!
[1598.96] Father, don’t you think
[1602.60] there is some benefit for 
Afsheen Ma’am in it?
[1605.52] What has happened to you?
[1609.52] Have you gone mad?
[1614.88] What benefit will Afsheen Ma’am 
get from your marriage?
[1618.88] What are you saying?
[1620.52] Father, things have changed nowadays,
[1623.36] nobody helps anyone until 
they get something out of it too.
[1626.52] It is a simple thing,
[1630.16] Afsheen Ma’am doesn’t want Ramsha 
to stay in her house,
[1632.52] she wants Mr. Qasim and herself 
to get done with Ramsha’s responsibility!
[1648.04] And who will tolerate a stranger girl 
in their home for this long?
[1655.52] No father, there is something else.
[1658.20] To hell with what you think!
[1661.76] I know one thing, son,
[1670.56] that the day you and Ramsha 
will get married,
[1681.60] that day this house and that shop,
[1690.64] will become ours, ours!
[1698.68] and whatever Mr. Qasim will give 
will be added as well.
[1709.52] it is a clear matter,
[1711.80] son, if Brother Sajid would have been alive
[1714.88] even then he would have been unable 
to give what Mr. Qasim will give!
[1729.40] They are people of status!
[1731.84] They call Ramsha, their daughter,
[1740.72] now they will not wed her off
 empty handed.
[1750.64] what do you think?
[1753.04] Now I am about to drink my tea,
[1756.12] let me drink my tea in peace,
[1758.72] don’t say anything in between!
[1811.44] Brother, Ramsha’s aunt is calling 
again and again…
[1824.12] what shall I tell her?
[1835.00] Aunt, there is no need to give an answer,
 just say no…
[1853.56] Afnan, Mom is asking Uncle,
not you!
[1864.56] And I am not talking to you 
but with Aunt!
[1893.44] Brother, I think we should accept it.
[1910.08] there is good and bad in every person,
[1926.76] By God’s grace, 
Ramsha is intelligent enough,
[1929.24] and I believe that after marriage, 
she will be able to change that boy!
[1947.76] And we have seen so many marriages
[1950.72] where boys are irresponsible before 
marriage but after marriage,
[1959.96] boys do change themselves!
[1970.72] Whatever it is Afsheen!
[1972.80] I don’t want to take any decision
 without talking to Ramsha.
[1996.04] Let me talk to her first.
[1999.72] Uncle…
[2014.32] I accept this proposal.
[2055.72] Ramsha, child, tell me honestly,
[2059.48] did anyone force you to say yes?
[2081.44] No,
[2083.88] no one forced me…
[2095.60] I have accepted this proposal by heart,
[2097.96] you can call Uncle and Aunt 
and say “yes” to them.
[2122.00] I am getting late for Academy,
I am going,
[2124.80] goodbye!
[2126.96] May God keep you safe.
[2156.16] Uhm, excuse me.
[2170.52] Whatever I am asking you, 
answer me honestly,
[2174.08] was it Aunt or Alizeh who forced you 
to accept Shani’s proposal?
[2180.68] Now don’t lie to me,
[2182.32] you can lie to the entire world 
but not me.
[2185.96] Nobody forced me.
[2187.56] You are lying to me,
[2189.56] swear to me that you are not lying!
[2192.00] Why shall I swear?
[2198.04] Do you even believe when I swear?
[2204.84] I swore to love you and 
be faithful to you,
[2208.68] you never believed me then, so 
why are you asking me to swear today?
[2211.84] Don’t punish yourself for 
my mistakes Ramsha.
[2214.96] Look Afnan,
[2216.24] you are living your life just like 
you wanted to live.
[2224.68] Let me live my life the way 
I want to live as well.
[2232.80] Stay away from me!
