I am just going to have food
and get to the shop then, do one thing hand over
the grocery list to brother, he will get it out for you. Yes, yes, I will just be there,
I will be there. We will meet then. Bye. I don’t see Annie around.
Where is she? She has gone to her friend’s
house with Ramsha for combined study. How many times have
I told you not to send her with Ramsha? Can't you hear me? What is wrong with you Anwar? She is your niece, you have a bond with her, I know she has made a mistake. I have no relationship with her, she is nothing to me. Brother Sajid can get blind and
deaf for the love her daughter, I cannot. No Anwar, sometimes, in order to fulfill
some relationships, despite listening and seeing
a lot of things, we have to act blind and deaf. Enough, enough, had it been me instead of brother Sajid, I would have killed my child by now. No, no matter what our child does, we can never stop loving our children, I have realized it very well. What to do about such a child that cannot keep their parents' honor safe. Give me food. Love of children. What happened? My friend Hania? Yes. Her boyfriend shot in front
of me by a gun, and she died then and there,
you know what? Okay fine.. The police think it’s my fault. They kept me in the prison. quiet, quiet. Be quiet. I am here now, everything will be fine now. What kind of a girl are you? Ramsha, how wouldn’t I come? It was you, I had to come for you at any cost. And I know it very well that
you haven’t done anything, you are being framed in the matter, but I am with you Ramsha, I will not leave your back in
these difficult times. Yeah? I am so sorry, I am so sorry, I know that I got late today
as well as usual, but you know what?
My planning was amazing today, I was leaving the office right in time but then suddenly
I had to attend a meeting, now you know that I cannot just leave the employees. I had to attend the meeting because
the interaction needed to be maintained, an important client was coming, anyways, tell me did you eat something? Shall I order something? But tell me what is the matter that you called me
here so urgently to talk about? Tell me now? What? What happened? Hello? Where are you lost? You talk so much usually that
I get fed up and today when you had to talk
about something important you are not saying anything, tell me what was it? Actually Afnan, I want to talk about something
important but I don’t know how to start. I can’t believe this, you are saying that? You are saying this
who doesn’t get tired of talking and she doesn’t know how to talk today? What happened to you? Are you feeling okay? Do you have a fever? Come let me take you to the doctor. Afnan, actually my family is l
ooking to get me married, that is why I want us to
get married now. Sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry, you have said such a funny thing that it made me laugh. What is wrong with you? Is this something you
should be joking about? I am not joking Afnan,
I am serious If this is not a joke, then what is it? You know you have this
one problem in you, you don’t understand people’s
situation because of your immaturity. I am so stressed for work, I still got meetings cancelled, to meet you so that I can stand with you in your
problems for your friendship and now you are saying this to me? Come on, there is a limit to drag a joke. Afnan, parents are searching
for proposals for me, that is why I told my parents
everything true about us. And mom wants you to come with
a proposal along with your family. Is that true? I mean you want my family to come to your house with a proposal for marriage? Afnan? What has happened? Where are we going Afnan? Why don’t you respond
what happened? Mom, the weather is so nice, right? Hmm, yes Greetings, Peace be upon you
and God's mercy and blessings. Greetings, Come, brother, sit. How are you, uncle? Absolutely fine, are you doing well? Afnan didn’t come? Afnan didn’t come? He left office way early, he should have gotten here by now. Okay I will check. In fact, Alizey, call him
and ask where is he. Okay mom. Have tea, brother. Thank you. Why this scene?
What is wrong with you? Why were you saying that
you will marry me? How did even this come to your brain? Tell me? what is wrong with you, Afnan? You love me, if you won’t marry me, then
who else will you marry? What is wrong with you? I just talk to you nicely a couple of times, does that mean I will marry you? You didn’t just talk to me
nicely a couple of times, you have always taken care of me, and this is not a friendship, you have been concerned for me, you saved me from a trouble. I just showed sympathy towards to you, I thought that she is probably a naïve girl who might need my guidance and if I can make her a
good friend and guide her, save her from bad people,
so this was not love, that doesn’t mean,
I want to marry you. Please, you must understand. Afnan? What are you saying, Afnan? Do you actually not love me? yes, I truly, falsely, in any world,
I do not love you, Ramsha, but why don’t you
understand this Ramsha? You are joking, right? That is not possible, you have taken such good care of me, you always stood by my side, how can you not love me? Ramsha, Ramsha, for God’s sake, stop crying and whining, don’t make a scene here, don’t force me, look people will see, what will they say? Please don’t do it. No Afnan, you, you first say that you
are joking with me, you love me, right? You love me, You want to marry me, right? Please. Why are you forcing me? I told you, I don’t love you, I have always considered you a friend that is why I helped you, and that’s it. I don’t love you, so should I forcefully
tell you that I love you? Leave it, we won’t be in any sort of
terms from now onwards. I made a mistake that I helped you, its all my fault. This is it. I am sorry, I cannot live with this burden, that si why I am leaving. No Afnan, don’t do this, look I love you and I have told mom that I am coming to meet you, I want to marry you, you love me, I love you… Just shut up! It is not my fault that you
said all this to your mom, but I never said that
I love you or I will marry you, I am telling you, whatever relationship we had
is over from now onwards and please, never try to meet me again, in fact, don’t even try to talk to me. You don’t…
Ramsha, don’t create a scene. Afnan, why don’t you understand? I am telling you. Shut up! Why don’t you understand
what I am saying? Why don’t you understand at once
that I don’t love you, Ramsha? I am sorry but don’t talk to me ever again, don’t try to meet me. This is it! Bye. Alizey, did you call Afnan, where is he? Mom, I didn’t talk to him, I don’t know where he is. I Asked you to call him, but you didn’t call him, how can you be so careless, Alizey? I asked you to call Afnan and
ask him where he is. What is wrong you with you, mom? He must be with his friends. Alizey, call him right now, ask him which friend he is
with and where he is. And when will he come home? Okay I will call him in a bit. Call him right now. Come on pick up the phone, come on. He is not picking up, mom he must be busy somewhere he will call me back, why are you getting worried? I even asked you to take me along, but no you dropped me at Rakshi’s house, I don’t know anything about
what happened afterwards. Ramsha? What happened? Afnan will bring his family, right? Ramsha, you didn’t even tell me anything
on way, at least tell me now. How did the conversation go
between Afnan and you? I am not getting a good vibe, I am getting negative thoughts. Your thoughts are absolutely right, Annie, I didn’t get Afnan? What do you mean by you didn’t get him? He didn’t come to meet you? But you called him a day earlier? You guys even had decided a time to meet, then what happened? I guess there was some misunderstanding and this misunderstanding took me to him and I didn’t get him. It’s good that you came, knead the dough I had to make flatbread for your dad, he wants to have food. Okay Mom. Come, quickly. What? Sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry, for a second I thought you are serious, What is wrong with you? Is this something
you should be joking about? I am not joking Afnan,
I am serious If this is not a joke, then what is it? You know you have this
one problem in you, you don’t understand people’s
situation because of your immaturity. I am so stressed for work, I still got meetings cancelled, to meet you so that I can stand with you in your
problems for your friendship and now you are saying this to me? Come on, there is a limit to drag a joke. Afnan, parents are searching
for proposals for me, that is why I told my parents
everything true about us. And mom wants you to come
with a proposal along with your family. I mean you want my family to come to your house with a proposal for marriage? Why this scene? Why were you saying
that you will marry me? How did even this come
to your brain? Tell me? what is wrong with you, Afnan? You love me, if you won’t marry me,
then who else will you marry? What is wrong with you? I just talk to you nicely a couple of times, does that mean I will marry you? I thought that she is probably a naïve girl who might need my guidance and if I can make her a good friend and guide her, save her from bad people, so this was not love, that doesn’t mean, I want to marry you. Do you actually not love me? yes, I truly, falsely, in any world, I do not love you, Ramsha, but why don’t you understand this. umm, this is my car, I guess you were trying to open the door. Ramsha. Afnan. Sit down. Umm hand. Sorry. Okay then go, you don’t care about me at all, this shows I am not important
for you at all. Really? Look at me? Hey, look at me. Yes? If you weren’t important for me, I wouldn’t have been here today. Did you bring me here? No, no, I just came to visit you. Of course I brought you here. Y ou know what would have happened to
you if I hadn’t have come there? You fainted and you were alone, your friend left you there alone. What? Why are you laughing? I am thinking, whenever I have called you
in the times of trouble, you have always come. The problem is that you
get into trouble a lot. Hania’s boyfriend shot
her in front of my eyes and the police blamed me for everything, I don’t know what would have I done, if you didn’t come, they were, they were about to do something
very bad to me. Ramsha? Ramsha, how wouldn’t I come? It was you, I had to come for you at any cost. And I know very well that
you haven’t done anything, you are being framed in the matter, but I am with you Ramsha, I will not leave your back in
these difficult times. You are joking, right? That is not possible, you have taken such good care of me, you always stood by my side, how can you not love me? Ramsha, Ramsha, for God’s sake, stop crying and whining, don’t make a scene here, don’t force me, look people will see,
what will they say? Please don’t do it. No Afnan, you, you first say that you
are joking with me, you love me, right? You love me, You want to marry me, right? Please. Why are you forcing me? I told you, I don’t love you, I have always considered
you a friend that is why I helped you, and that’s it. I don’t love you, so should I forcefully tell
you that I love you? Leave it, we won’t be in any sort of terms
from now onwards. I made a mistake that I helped you, its all my fault. This is it. I am sorry, I cannot live with this burden, that si why I am leaving. No Afnan, don’t do this, look I love you and I have told mom
that I am coming to meet you, I want to marry you, 
you love me, I love you… Just shut up! It is not my fault that you 
said all this to your mom, but I never said that 
I love you or I will marry you, I am telling you, whatever relationship 
we had is over from now onwards and please, never try to meet me again, You don’t… No Afnan, no. Ramsha, don’t create a scene. Afnan, why don’t you understand? I am telling you. Shut up! Why don’t you understand
 what I am saying? Why don’t you understand at once that I don’t love you, Ramsha? I am sorry but don’t talk to me ever again, don’t try to meet me. This is it! Bye. Hello? Hello? At least talk if you had called. What is this new way of torturing, that you will call and won’t talk? Why don’t you understand that I am getting disturbed by your calls, it has become difficult for 
me to work in the office, I am unable to work. If this is not love, then what is it? And then you say 
that you don’t love me? Ramsha, how should
 I make you understand that I am not liking the fact that you
 are getting disturbed because of me? And believe me I didn’t want to hurt, in fact I cannot hurt any person
 in the whole world, now if you are taking it as 
love then it is your fault, not mine. I took care of you as a friend, I was being nice to you and this is not my love but
 a part of my brought up. None of your reasoning 
can convince me, Afnan, I don’t believe that 
you don’t love me, you do love me. I don’t feel sympathy for you
 but I feel angry now, is this how you talk? Why are you forcing me? Has anyone ever forcefully 
loved someone in this world? It is not possible Ramsha. Okay you tell me, if I tell you to love my 
friend Fahad, will you? Afnan? You wouldn’t be able to, right? So why don’t you understand 
this little thing? There is a limit of being stubborn. Afnan? Ramsha didn’t come to have food? Won’t she have food? I have been calling her for so long, I don’t know she is not listening, I will do one thing, I will go call her. Leave it, you have food, she will come. What are the updates on the proposal? Did she get any? I won’t delay her marriage
 as soon as I find any decent proposal. Why are you quiet? Answer me? Are you in conversation with anyone? Yes, I have spoken to the matchmaker to look for a good proposal for Ramsha, we cannot get a good 
proposal that soon, it will take some time. Hmm, okay. Why aren’t you having food? Are you not hungry? No mom, I am not hungry right now. Did you talk to that boy? umm, actually, umm, mom, he has gone out of country, his number is switched 
off so I couldn’t talk to him. if you talk to him now, do let him know that your 
dad is looking for a match for you, so he should send his 
parents as soon as possible because your dad wants to get
 you married as soon as possible. Okay mom. okay, take this.
