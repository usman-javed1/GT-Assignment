[24.36] You didn’t remind me
[27.72] that I had to give you 
the wedding night gift.
[49.24] You look very pretty.
[54.84] I don’t know how long I have been
 waiting for this day.
[70.28] Your wedding gift.
[81.32] This is your wedding gift.
[162.08] Why are you acting so pious?
[165.96] Have you forgotten your past?
[169.96] I knew it,
[171.40] I knew very well about 
your shallowness.
[173.72] Yes, I am shallow, 
you got me absolutely right,
[177.04] and after the marriage, you will realize 
that I am not just shallow
[180.92] but very pathetic too
[182.80] because I have remembered 
everything
[186.72] and I will take revenge 
for each one of it.
[218.40] Once,
[220.60] just once say it to me that 
you don’t want to do this marriage,
[223.24] I will support you and stand by you.
[225.56] What is wrong with you, Afnan?
[227.88] What are you even saying? 
Why are you causing me hurt and pain?
[233.16] Whatever you are saying is 
causing me pain, Afnan,
[235.64] for God’s sake, just keep quiet
[237.88] and take me to the hall,
[241.72] it has already been so late,
[244.32] if we get late anymore,
[245.68] I will once again get dishonored 
because of you.
[247.84] I won’t let any of that happen, 
I promise,
[251.72] just say the truth once,
[254.12] just gather the strength and tell me, 
I will stand by you
[256.28] and Shani won’t be able to 
say anything to you, I…
[258.16] What has happened to you? 
Why are you saying all this?
[261.44] Why are you hurting me and 
causing me pain by saying all this?
[264.44] Because I want to marry you.
[312.00] Greetings dad.
[313.12] Greetings, may peace be upon you.
[317.28] Is everything okay?
[319.80] You look tired and your eyes are
 swollen too, are you feeling okay?
[323.52] Is everything fine?
[325.76] Yes dad, it’s just that
[328.08] I slept late at night,
[331.72] I couldn't sleep well so my head hurts.
[335.24] So you must sleep in time,
[337.72] if you will sleep well,
[340.16] you will stay healthy and feel fresh
[342.96] and I didn’t even see you at the prayers?
[347.56] Umm, I couldn’t wake up.
[350.88] You will wake up if you sleep in time.
[361.28] Look,
[363.72] the house has become so empty 
since Ramsha left.
[376.76] This girl came to our house 
for a few days
[379.24] and made a place in everyone’s hearts,
[389.00] she never made us feel like a stranger
by the way she used to talk and behave.
[395.44] Yes dad,
[404.56] some people are like that,
[410.32] who would gradually win
 everybody’s heart.
[415.32] Yes, some people are like that.
[429.96] Okay then come let’s have breakfast, 
Afnan.
[438.16] Afnan?
Yes?
[439.52] Come, let’s have breakfast, come.
[442.92] Come, good boy.
[467.40] Come in.
[469.76] Is it morning for the bride yet?
[472.08] Everyone is waiting for 
the bride downstairs,
[474.16] Mom is saying to call my daughter-in-law
for breakfast first.
[487.56] What happened Ramsha? 
Hmm?
[493.16] You are crying?
[495.64] No.
[500.36] You are crying.
[510.24] Did brother say something to you?
[521.48] I thought that brother’s heart would melt 
for you after marriage
[534.16] but he didn’t change his attitude,
[536.16] is that what you do to your bride?
[545.88] You shouldn’t have married brother.
[556.08] I will go and tell mom right now 
she will fix him.
[558.32] No. Annie?
[561.76] Don’t tell anything to aunt.
[570.04] I don’t want to make complaints
[579.60] and Shani gets mistrustful 
towards me.
[589.84] He is my husband
[592.04] now I want to make my place 
in his heart
[602.16] and I need support from you 
all for that.
[607.60] I am very happy Ramsha that 
my brother got a wife like you.
[616.24] God will definitely help you 
accomplish your purpose.
[626.28] Now fix your mood and 
come downstairs, please?
[628.96] Hmm?
[674.72] You haven’t cut the vegetables yet?
[676.44] It’s almost time for 
the guests to come,
[679.28] hurry up a little.
[685.76] Mom,
[688.56] why all these preparations?
[690.56] Are we expecting any guests?
[691.96] Yes, brother has thrown a feast 
for Ramsha.
[696.40] Feast for Ramsha?
[698.64] Why?
[705.20] That girl has left this house 
after so much difficulty
[707.68] now he will invite her for feats 
and call her back here?
[710.20] What can I say?
[711.88] He said that they have gotten married,
[714.44] they are new bride and groom and 
should be invited to the feast
[722.60] though I even indirectly told him
[725.32] that it is their own house and they could 
come without any invitation too
[733.00] but he specially called them 
to invite them.
[736.52] Mom, I don’t understand
[738.32] why is uncle always 
so worried for that girl.
[742.72] What do you mean?
[744.12] I mean to say that he is much more tense
about that girl than his own daughter-in-law?
[748.36] Why?
[750.16] Alizeh, there is nothing like that,
actually,
[752.64] brother always wanted a daughter
[755.92] and Ramsha has also taken 
a lot of care of brother,
[763.60] so that is why he made Ramsha 
his daughter.
[772.44] I used to tell you to take care of brother 
and give him time
[780.28] but you have always been busy
with your career
[783.44] and never gave time to home.
[785.52] Please Mom,
[786.76] I cannot put my career 
at stake for uncle.
[798.56] You say such old wives’ things 
sometimes.
[802.76] Anyway,
[804.12] this has all become a routine now,
[805.84] send coffee for me.
[829.52] Umm, what should I take out, 
Ramsha?
[833.00] Take out anything, Annie, 
I will wear it.
[835.96] This one, hey,
[840.00] why anything?
[842.32] You are a newlywed bride, 
wear something nice.
[844.40] If I were you, I would have worn 
a heavy dress,
[847.00] done dark make-up and would have 
worn heavy jewellery
[850.04] and I would have stayed dressed up
at home too.
[852.04] God forbid, you are ever in my place.
[861.48] I mean, why someone like Shani?
[864.40] May God give you a way better 
husband than Shani,
[866.64] who loves you a lot 
and respects you.
[869.20] Amen.
[872.20] You don’t get disheartened 
because of brother,
[876.80] he is habitual of spoiling things,
[879.52] he does that to mom and I, as well, 
he is always cranky,
[883.64] don’t worry because of her,
[885.16] you tell me what do you 
want to wear?
[892.60] This, umm,
[895.28] wear something red, 
this is a very dull color.
[899.36] What are you doing here?
[902.36] I was helping Ramsha to take out 
clothes for the dinner.
[907.20] Are you here to help her with 
clothed or provoke her?
[908.96] There is nothing like that Shani, 
what is wrong with you?
[916.40] Do you work and leave, come on.
[919.68] Ramsha, wear this one.
[924.76] What is this behavior?
[929.20] Wear the clothes and get ready.
[939.60] What is this behavior?
[941.44] I don’t understand 
what is all this going on?
[945.12] They invited just the bride and 
groom for the dinner,
[949.56] no one even asked us?
[959.00] Though according to the tradition 
whenever
[961.60] the parents’ family invites for dinner,
the entire in-law’s family is invited,
[969.64] you just don’t invite the boy 
and the girl.
[973.60] Anwar,
[975.60] this is her parents’ house, 
not that one.
[985.44] You should be grateful that brother Qasim
takes so much care of her.
[991.80] I thought something else.
[997.84] I thought that we had become 
Mr Qasim’s relatives
[1001.88] so we will visit each other often,
[1003.88] he loves her so much so he would
 do something at least.
[1007.44] You are not relatives of Mr. Qasim 
but Ramsha,
[1010.36] and it was before as well and 
what difference does all of this make?
[1013.28] I don’t know why have you started 
to dream so big.
[1025.04] And everyone invited the 
newlywed couple for dinners anyway,
[1028.76] it doesn't mean we all should
 go with them,
[1039.12] there is a limit.
[1041.28] We are leaving.
[1042.76] Go. 
Bye.
[1047.32] Stay happy, you look very beautiful
[1048.92] by the grace of God, 
protect yourself from evil eye.
[1051.16] Okay, my child,
[1052.92] you must go but
[1055.52] if you can tell Mr. Qasim that
[1058.88] whenever he invites you guys 
for dinner next time,
[1061.72] he must invite us too.
[1068.76] My child, it looks good that everyone
goes to dinner together, yeah?
[1073.52] Go, stay blessed, stay blessed.
[1075.84] I am going to go start the bike. 
Yeah.
[1082.88] You look very beautiful 
by the grace of God,
[1085.12] I will recite on you 
when you come back.
[1091.44] Give my regards to everyone there
[1093.20] and yes, tell Shani to 
ride the bike carefully.
[1096.92] Okay, go. 
Bye.
[1098.12] Bye, my child.
[1103.28] It is the limit, by the way,
[1106.24] what was the harm in 
inviting us as well?
[1211.72] Actually, I had to go to the academy,
[1213.88] I have just checked there was 
no driver here,
[1216.44] so will you please call the driver 
and ask him to come?
[1222.84] Ramsha, is there any specific time 
for you to go to the academy
[1227.04] or do you just go there any time?
[1235.24] The servants of this house are 
the servants of this house,
[1240.08] they are not your personal assistants.
[1247.88] Actually, I have a special lecture today
[1250.24] so I am going to the academy 
at this time else I…
[1253.64] Anyway, the driver is not here,
[1255.32] if you want to go you can go 
in the auto-rickshaw.
[1262.20] You were roaming around 
in cars, Ramsha,
[1268.64] you forgot your place,
[1274.04] and I am sure you must have realized
[1276.36] your actual place now after sitting 
on this broken bike.
[1282.72] You were flying so high,
[1285.44] now it’s time to crawl on the ground.
[1345.40] Greetings, madam Ramsha.
[1346.48] Greetings, how are you?
[1347.88] Yes, I am fine by the grace of God, 
are you fine?
[1365.32] Shani?
[1369.04] Umm you sit here, 
I will go check on uncle.
[1371.72] Why?
[1373.56] Can’t he come here to meet us?
[1376.44] He wouldn’t know that we are here,
I will go check, you sit down.
[1458.68] Greetings.
[1461.40] How are you?
[1462.92] I am fine.
[1466.72] You came here on bike?
[1469.96] Yes.
[1471.28] Tsk, tsk,
[1473.36] you could have asked your husband
[1474.88] and he would have at least 
brought you here in a taxi,
[1481.64] now look you have become 
habitual of roaming around
[1484.92] in big cars while staying in this house.
[1492.84] It must have been so difficult 
for you to come on a bike.
[1499.48] You are not even used to it anymore.
[1502.52] There is nothing like that,
[1504.72] I have learned to change my habits 
according to the requirements and situations,
[1512.24] thank God,
[1514.08] and the ones who know to 
adjust to the situations,
[1520.48] bikes, and cars don’t make 
any difference to them.
[1524.36] Anyway, forget about all this,
[1526.56] what did your husband gift you 
as a wedding gift?
[1534.52] You didn’t remind me
[1537.88] that I had to give you 
the wedding night gift.
[1541.40] You look very pretty.
[1543.36] I don’t know how long I have been
waiting for this day.
[1553.20] Your wedding gift.
[1568.08] This is your wedding gift.
[1590.64] What happened?
[1594.92] Why did you get quiet?
[1597.48] Umm,
[1598.80] he has given me a ring,
[1600.76] ring is usually gifted as 
the wedding gift, right?
[1605.32] Where is the ring? 
Tell me?
[1609.12] I forgot it at home, today,
 I forgot to wear it.
[1614.00] You are very careless,
[1616.52] you couldn’t even take care 
of the ring for one day?
[1623.32] Do you see this?
[1629.56] Afnan gave it to me as a wedding gift,
[1632.68] I haven’t taken it off ever since
 that day.
[1643.40] Listen?
[1647.84] I will be glad if you come here 
as a guest,
[1656.16] you get what I am saying, right?
[1661.00] I am going to meet uncle.
[1681.92] I am so glad to see you here,
[1684.48] the house has become so gloomy 
ever since you left.
[1694.04] They say it right
[1696.48] that daughters are the light 
of the house.
[1698.96] You are right, uncle.
[1704.60] I miss you a lot and tell me something,
[1707.88] are you taking your medicines in time?
[1714.08] I hope you are not slacking in your diet?
[1717.28] Yes, I take all the medicines in time,
[1720.64] you just keep on visiting and
I will be fine.
[1725.64] Okay, uncle,
[1726.80] I will come to meet you sometimes and
 you will come to meet me sometimes too.
[1734.32] Okay? You will come, right?
[1736.20] I will come too, if God wills.
[1742.64] Okay its time for prayers, 
I will go offer prayers.
[1746.08] Okay?
Okay.
[1747.32] Stay blessed.
[1781.88] Ramsha?
[1785.60] How are you?
[1788.16] I am fine.
[1792.68] Are you happy?
[1807.56] Yes, I am very happy.
[1814.16] But your face doesn’t seem like 
you are happy.
[1823.84] There is a smile on your face
[1827.80] but sadness in your eyes
[1834.20] and eyes never lie
[1837.28] they tell the situation of the heart.
[1868.84] Madam Ramsha,
[1869.96] the food is served,
 you guys may come.
[1945.60] Aunt, you had arranged so much,
[1948.64] what was the need of this formality?
[1951.00] I will tell you,
[1952.44] actually they feel that 
we don’t get to eat all this
[1973.36] that is why she got 
so many things made
[1977.08] and I understand that all this is being 
done to brag it to me,
[1995.72] and if you won’t brag it to me 
how will you degrade me?
[2002.00] Shani, what is wrong? 
What are you saying?
[2003.80] There is nothing like that.
[2011.60] No, it is like that but 
you don’t understand.
[2014.76] No, no my child, 
there is nothing like that.
[2017.80] it is like that.
[2024.64] We just expressed our love 
and affection towards you,
[2046.84] if you disliked something,
[2049.76] I apologize.
[2074.12] Uncle?
[2081.20] No, no,
[2082.88] actually it is my fault that 
I came here on his invitation,
[2086.32] because he just had one purpose,
[2087.88] they had called me here to humiliate me
and degrade me, what else?
[2113.60] Enough, Shani, For God’s…
What do you mean by enough?
[2116.36] Don’t you see how they are 
humiliating me?
[2118.68] If you have to be humiliated here 
and eat then you may eat!
[2137.96] I am leaving.
[2141.56] Let’s go Ramsha.
[2156.80] I am really sorry,
[2158.20] I am so sorry, forgive me.
[2192.68] You have done so wrong, Shani.
[2194.88] You shouldn’t have done all this,
[2196.92] uncle has been so hurt because of you
and I was so embarrassed.
[2201.24] What happened? 
You guys came so early?
[2203.88] Ask him this,
[2205.52] he has gotten me 
so humiliated over there.
[2220.48] He brought me without even 
eating food,
[2223.20] uncle has been so hurt 
because of his action.
[2226.96] Shani?
[2233.44] What is Ramsha saying?
[2246.08] What is this behavior?
[2247.60] What happened, after all?
[2250.12] Nothing happened, 
nothing happened at all,
[2252.60] no one said anything to him.
[2263.68] Everyone gave so much respect 
and love,
[2265.96] they made such good arrangements 
for food but…
[2280.68] but he couldn’t digest the fact
[2282.64] that why have they arranged 
so much for him?
[2285.40] He thought they had made 
those arrangements to degrade him
[2300.44] and he left from there and brought me 
along with him as well.
[2313.04] I was so embarrassed in front of him, 
does he have any idea?
[2317.64] Shani? What is this behavior?
[2319.64] You went there for the first time
[2321.56] and what have you done?
[2334.84] Did you leave without eating?
[2338.56] Mom, what have you cooked?
[2341.08] Please serve the food.
[2353.24] And come sit, let’s eat.
[2357.00] You eat it, I don’t want to.
[2359.20] Hey.
[2362.08] Shani,
[2363.16] is this the way to behave? 
What have you done?
[2366.00] Mom, this is the way
[2368.08] now they all will know what is Shani.
