People are right, when the shade of the father is removed 
from the head of the children, then the world even takes away
the right to live. Okay child, you don’t say anything. Isn’t this injustice mama. Hey, child I know it is injustice. But see, let me talk. What if you talk and things get out of hand 
instead of getting sorted. You just don’t say anything. Sajid always wished that 
Ramsha progresses. Forgive me sister in law, you might find what I say bitter, 
but this is the truth. If Ramsha had to study further, 
she wouldn’t do all this. After all, sister in law, the girls who want to study, 
they just study and they don’t do anything else. If the child sets out on the wrong path, then the child is not blame 
for it completely, in fact, even the parents are at fault. Maybe I couldn’t bring up 
my daughter the way she should have been brought up. We put restrictions on our children, but we are unable to explain the difference 
between good and bad to them. That is why they don’t have 
the realization of right and wrong. Because of our restrictions, 
they are misled about us. You can say what you want, 
sister in law. But the reality is that because of Ramsha’s disobedience we have already been insulted 
enough in the neighbourhood. Forgive me, I am alone now, I cannot take any further risk. What else should she do? She is not getting married, you wont let her study, so my daughter stays at home,
 hear people taunt her and she becomes a mental patient. 
Do you want this? I am still alive. I am her mother. I will decide what is right for her. And I hopeyou... you will at least let your brother’s widow 
peacefully in her mourning. Ramsha will study further, Ramsha will go to university 
from tomorrow and this is my final decision. My cousin Nabeel, she almost got married to her. She almost got married, meaning? Think that they didn’t get married. Why? Right at the wedding day, 
in fact, at the wedding time, I saw that girl. I recognized her as soon as I saw her. I told my aunt and cousin 
that girl’s entire history. In fact, think that I showed them 
all her videos. Actually, my maternal side 
of the family are proper, they are really far from this social media, those poor things didn’t know. Hey, you broke off a girl’s marriage, and you ruined her happy life and
you are asking me why I dislike it? Think, Wahaj, think, if your own sister was in Ramsha’s place and some man did something 
so cheap with her, then what would you have done? Look, mind what you say. The daughters and daughter in laws
 of our home don’t do such cheap things. What is cheap in what she did? 
What has she done? If there is something like that,
 you marry her. We bring such a girl to our home. Where? Outside?
Yes. No Afnan, you know I am not interested
in getting drenched in the rain. Come on, Alizay, this is the first rain of the season. There is no rain beautiful than this. Getting drenched in it has its own fun,
like Ramsha says… Who Ramsha? Ramsha, she is an employee
in my office. Newly hired. She was saying it one day 
so I remember. But leave her. Salma. Salma, I am telling you, this beloved sister in law of yours
 will regret it. She will cry with tears and then 
there will be no one to wipe her tears. She has given her daughter such a 
free hand. Remember this. Hey, whether she regrets or 
does good or does bad, why do you care? It is a matter between her 
and her daughter. Why are you burning your blood? 
Let them be. What are you saying? Huh? Who knows them? The world knows me. The world will say things to me. He couldn’t take care of his widow 
sister in law and orphan niece. He couldn’t take their responsibility. 
Who knows them? Yes so say that they don’t listen to me. After all, who in today’s time 
listens to anyone, they do what they want. You said it so easily, like I will say it and this damned world 
will believe me. I am telling you, I want to leave looking at what the 
environment of the home has become. Where are you going bare footed? You people have made me mad. How can Anwar say this? He is always upset with my daughter. Yes, mama, you called me?
Yes, child. Here is your mobile, keep it. No, there is no need for that, mama. You keep it. I have your phone, if I need to, 
I will use your phone. Now you will go to university, you will need it, child. After all, I will be at ease. If you get late, I will get worried. At least, I will be able to talk to you.
Here you go. Ramsha, things are not good or bad, in fact the good or bad use of it 
is in a person’s hands. Keep it. Thank you, mama. Afnan called? Ramsha, things are not good or bad, child. In fact, the good or bad use of it
is in a person’s hands. Thank God Fahad you came today or else I thought that you would 
make an excuse even today. Had Alizay asked me, 
I would have ignored her, but it is not possible that I ignore you. Did you see, mama? He is always making excuses.
He always makes excuses. No see, I called him, and he came. I am surprised that he came on 
one call from you or he always has an excuse ready 
with him all the time. Man, look, I have come as a guest
 at your home. And if you don’t know then 
get a lecture from uncle, how you give respect to a guest, 
how you treat them. Yes, yes, if the guest is like you, then this is how you respect them. Thank you. You people sit, I will change and come. Fahad, your cousin designs 
such good clothes, make me meet her some time No issue in that. You tell me whenever you have time, 
I will take you. Hey Afnan, come. 
See, Fahad is here. Come on. Greetings aunt. Greetings. Brother, long time. Fahad, you sit, I will get food served and 
you will not go without eating. You people chat.
Sure. Why did you come here? Look, I don’t need your permission 
nor your friendship to come to this home. I know you well and 
also your double standards. You are the one who has double standards, you were shaking your hand 
in front of aunt just for show. Oh, please… Okay, leave it, man. After all this anger doesn’t suit men. Come on, let’s have food. No, what does this mean? No man, what had to happen, 
happened. Come on. No need to say anything. Tell sister in law that she will get what she needs. Uncle, we need money. The money from the shop. After all, it doesn’t sound nice to ask you 
for everything again and again. Since papa has passed away, we have not got any money from 
the shop till now. When you are getting everything 
you need before asking for it, then what is the need for the money. A person has other needs 
apart from things. I want money for me. I have to pay the university fees. hear me clearly, girl, I don’t have any money for your university
and its fees. I am not asking you for your money. I am asking for the share in the shop, 
that papa owned. This means you are asking me for 
the accounts of the shop? From me? Right now, I didn’t come with this intention. But if I ask for the accounts,
 so what is wrong in that? Because that shop is my father’s. And I have full right to know where 
the money earned from it is being spent. Listen, girl, that shop was your father’s,
it is no more. And it was means, it was. I am taking care of that shop now. So, I am the owner of that shop. I think you are forgetting that if you are doing a job there, then you are also taking payment for it. And doing a job somewhere doesn’t 
make you own that home. So it would be better that 
you give us our right. Did you see? That little girl, who was born in front of me, my blood is asking me for 
the accounts of the shop. And all this is happening because of you. 
Because of you. What did I do, Anwar? 
I didn’t ask her to do all this. You surprise me Salma, you are still taking her side. Did you see the result of you taking her side? It was me stupid who was dying in the love of my 
widow sister in law and orphan niece. But not anymore, I am telling you. Not anymore. Now I will talk to sister in law myself, 
and I will do it right now. Hey, no Anwar, you stop, please. You don’t talk to her about anything. Sister in law is in mourning right now 
and she is unwell too. God forbid, she gets unwell 
cause of what you say, then will we be run with her 
to the hospital? So what do I do? 
What do I do? Should I shoot up my BP? If she is in her mourning, then 
she should stay in it peacefully. And she should control her daughter. Ill-mannered, she is interfering 
in everything. Okay, you calm down. I will talk to sister in law after finding 
the right opportunity. You don’t do it. Because if sister in law, tells someone 
or someone finds out, then what will people say? 
They will call us bad, they won’t say anything to her. Annie. Annie, child, make good tea 
for your father. I am telling you Salma, I will not tolerate it anymore. She is in mourning. Sister in law, you know 
the condition nowadays. Anwar was telling me that the shop doesn’t earn as much as
it used to earlier. We manage the expenses of the home 
with difficulty in it. And if you and I don’t understand it, 
who will? I have to pay Ramsha’s fees. You tell Ramsha to be patient 
for two to four days. As soon as we will get money, I will get you her fees first. But sister in law, you know 
this shop is so old. We would even face profit or loss at the time 
when brother Sajid was there, and nowadays the situation is such. Every business is at a stand still and every person is worried. Okay fine, I will tell Ramsha. But next week is the last day 
for her fee submission. Arrange the money for the fees 
in a day or two. Okay. Okay, I will ask for it. Don’t worry. People are right, when the shade of the father is removed
from the head of the children, then the world even takes away 
the right to live. Okay child, you don’t say anything. I will talk to Shani myself. Isn’t this injustice mama. Hey, child I know it is injustice. But see, let me talk. What if you talk and things get out 
of hand instead of getting sorted. You just don’t say anything. You can say what you want, sister in law. But the reality is that because of Ramsha’s disobedience we have already been insulted 
enough in the neighbourhood. Forgive me, I am alone now, I cannot take any further risk. Uncle, we need money. The money from the shop. After all, it doesn’t sound nice to ask you 
for everything again and again. Since papa has passed away, we have not got any money 
from the shop till now. When you are getting everything 
you need before asking for it, then what is the need for the money. A person has other needs apart from things. I want money for me. I have to pay
the university fees. hear me clearly, girl, I don’t have any money for 
your university and its fees. I am not asking you for your money. I am asking for the share in the shop, 
that papa owned. This means you are asking me for 
the accounts of the shop? From me? Right now, I didn’t come with
this intention. But if I ask for the accounts, 
so what is wrong in that? Because that shop is my father’s. And I have full right to know where 
the money earned from it is being spent. She is not getting married, you won’t let her study, so my daughter stays at home, 
hear people taunt her and she becomes a mental patient. 
Do you want this? I am still alive. I am her mother. I will decide what is right for her. And I hope you... you will at least let your brother’s widow 
peacefully in her mourning. Ramsha will study further, Ramsha will go to university 
from tomorrow and this is my final decision. What is the matter? What are you thinking? Nothing. Where is Shani? 
Is he back? Shani is back, he must be in his room. 
Why? Do you want something? Yes, Shani. Yes, papa? You should have told me, 
I would have come. Why? Can I not come to your room? You can come, but you don’t usually comes, 
so I thought… No, that… sit. Hey, sit, man. Sit. I just wanted to talk to you 
about something important. Yes. Shani, I want that you get married. I get married? You had said that first 
Annie will get married, then you will think about me. Yes, the situation was such back then, now I want that you get married and I want that you marry Ramsha. Ramsha? Papa. Why? What happened? Huh? Ramsha. Sister in law, nowadays, 
there is so much load-shedding, because of which even the work 
at the shop is suffering, and then the inflation. Obviously, the earning will be impacted. Anwar was saying that it is just me who is taking the shop 
forward with difficulty. That is fine, Salma. The load-shedding was also there
 when Sajid was alive. He never let me reduce my expenses. Sister in law, do you know? Shani and Anwar were telling me that 
the government has implemented some taxes too. Now tell me, should we pay taxes, pay the electricity bill, what else do 
we do in this inflation? Obviously, the earning will get impacted. And we are still able to manage the kitchen 
in the earning of the shop. We should thank God. Salma, I am also have to pay 
the fees for Ramsha, and there are some expenses at home too. By the way, sister in law, you sent Ramsha
to the university for no reason. Uncle became my father 
to raise his hand at me, and when it is about my expenses, 
uncle refused. Lower your voice, for God’s sake. If Anwar hears it, all hell will break loose. After all, child, we are not his responsibility. If he is fulfilling our needs, then we should be thankful for it. Thankful for what, mama? That shop is my father’s and if the money earned from it 
being spent on us, then he is not doing us a favour, 
it is our right. After all, how do I accept that when papa was there 
that shop was doing well, and a few months after papa left, 
there is no work at that shop. How is this possible, mama? Child, I am thinking I will take a further loan from sister Safia. No mama, you will not take a loan 
from anyone. How long will you take loans 
from how many people? This is a monthly thing. If you continue to take a loan every month, 
how will you return it? I have decided, I will do a job. What? You will do a job? Yes, mama, I will have to do something. Because I cannot let your and my life 
dependent on uncle at all. After all, the money and jewellery we had was 
spent on papa’s illness. We will have to do something. We cannot live like this dependent 
on them. But… God. What is wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? What is so impossible about what I said? Anwar, it is impossible. You don’t like Ramsha in any way, so now you are telling me that I talk to sister in law about Ramsha 
and Shani’s wedding. I doubt your mental condition. What are you trying to say? I have gone mad? I am saying delusional things? Listen to me, Salma. Whatever I am saying, I am saying it after thinking hard. The situation has been created, the insults we have faced
cause of Ramsha, now we will not get a proposal for her, and in this situation if we don’t help them, then 
who will help her. Tell me. But Anwar, you don’t like Ramsha. You are stuck on the same thing. If I don’t like her, what does that mean? I should leave her to suffer 
in front of the world? No. I cannot do that. She is the entrustment of my brother, she is the daughter of my late brother, taking care of her is my responsibility. And you just do one thing, you talk to sister in law. I am sure,
sister in law will not say no. Hey, there is no reason to say no. The amount of insult she has faced,
should be thankful to us, that despite this situation, we are willing to marry our son to her. Do you understand? Talk to her. Yes. Okay fine, mama. I will be back 
in a while, don’t worry. Okay, goodbye. Miss Ramsha. 
Yes? Come on. 
I should come? This way. Hmmm. I think I know you. I have seen you. Sir, my graduation is still not complete, but I want to do a job. Actually, I have done my diploma
in web designing and you can check, 
my typing speed is really good. You yourself are really good too. You are the same one, right? Shopping girl? The one who is really active 
on social media. I was active. Not anymore. Sir, you check my papers, 
I want that… Hey, leave the papers. I need a personal secretary. I think you are perfect for that job. Okay, but what work will I have to do in it? I mean, what will be my job? Your job? Hmmm. When I come to the office, then, ask me for tea or coffee, taking care of me. Talking to me. And rest you are smart yourself.
