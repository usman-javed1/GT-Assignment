It means if Tabassum didn’t 
tell you anything, you would have never trusted me? No, it’s not that, 
why are you saying this? I will say this, I will exactly say this. You have caused me 
so much pain Afnan, I have gone through so many troubles. Look I know you had to bear
a lot of trouble because of me but now I promise you that I will never let tears come 
in your eyes ever. What happened? Why are you quiet? You married me because 
you found out I was innocent so that you can give me support. No, not at all. The truth is that I love you, Ramsha, I love you a lot. The truth is that my false got defeated in front of 
my true love. Do you know when I was hooking you up
with Adeel, I was punishing myself by providing you 
with protection, punishment because 
I was unable to protect you, if you had actually married Adeel, I would have died alive. Why are you looking at me like this? I am looking at the fact that the dream I had at some 
point about my relationship with you, My God will fulfill that dream 
in a few moments, I couldn’t have even imagined that 
you will become my fate, Afnan. Why are you crying so much? It is not the time to cry. I am not crying, these are the tears of joy. I am happy. Every moment of our life will be filled with happiness and 
smiles from now onwards, there won’t be sorrows at all. Afnan, where were you? 
You came back so late. Yes, there was a lot of traffic 
so I got stuck. You go to sleep. Okay. I wanted to tell you something, madam Afsheen fired me 
from my job. Why did she fire you? Actually, she was afraid that 
I might tell you the truth. What are you saying, Tabassum? 
Tell me properly. Look at this. Don’t you remember how much money
I have spent to get her kidnapped, we have taken such a huge risk. Mom, I feel all our efforts 
will go to waste. Whatever you have done 
will go to waste. Kill me but I won’t marry you. I can’t kill you even if I want to. But if you don’t listen to me, I will definitely kill myself. No. Tell me should I kill myself? Okay, you won’t say like this, I will only count till 3, Ramsha, 1 2 I am ready. Afnan? 
Hmm? What happened? You seem to be
in a rush today. No, no, why would I be in a rush? 
I am getting ready like usual. I see you getting ready daily but you are getting ready 
so much rush today. Is everything okay? Umm yes actually, 
today Mr Ahmed, you know Mr Ahmed, 
he is our very old employee, he has scheduled a very important 
and urgent meeting today, so I just don’t want to get late for it. Mr Ahmed works under you, 
you are his boss, even if you get late, 
he won’t scold you. Yes but professionally ethically
it is not right, he is an elder, I have to take care of his respect.
 Bye. Hey, take your bag. Oh sorry. Thank you. Bye. 
Bye. I don’t know why Afnan has left 
for the office in such a rush today, he didn’t even have breakfast. His behavior seemed fishy too. There is definitely some problem. What kind of a wife are you, Alizey? You don’t know anything about 
what your husband is thinking, what is going on in his heart? 
Why is he worried, show some interest. So what should I do, Mom? If Afnan doesn’t want to share 
anything with me, what is my fault in it? Why are you blaming me for it? Because you are his wife and still you guys have so much 
distance in between, because you never took interest, you just care about your career, 
your lifestyle, you just focus on yourself. Have you ever focused 
on your husband? Because you don’t care. Umm... this is my car I guess you were trying 
to open the door. Umm I'm sorry. Ramsha. Afnan. Sit down. Umm hand. Sorry. Hey listen, where did you get these bangles from?
They are very nice. They are crystal. What if they are crystal,
they do look nice. It’s amazing, who likes crystal 
bangles anyway? You like them. I really like bangles in girls’ hands but they look really special 
in your hands. Thank you, I will wear bangles daily 
from now on. I am here now, everything will be fine. I don’t know what I would have 
done hadn’t you come, they were, they were about to do
something very wrong with me. Ramsha? How would I not come? It was you? I had to come for you at any cost and I know very well that 
you haven’t done anything, you are being framed in this matter but I am with you Ramsha, I won’t leave your side 
in this difficult time. Greetings. How are you? Greetings. you got so late. Hey I have put my life in danger
and come here, you know how? Not by driving the car 
but I flew it instead. I even told you to come soon as
 I am hungry. Even the breakfast has gotten cold now. So you should have had breakfast. It was our first breakfast after marriage, I should have had it alone? I am so sorry but do you know I got done with 
my breakfast as soon as I saw you. You look so beautiful. Stop the drama, 
come have breakfast. No, sit for a while. You have dressed up so well, I just want to save you in my eyes. Afnan, are you going somewhere? No I was just checking time on the phone. Keep the phone down and sleep. Hmm. Listen, switch off this light, please. Okay. the dream I had at some point 
about my relationship with you, My God will fulfill that dream 
in a few moments, I couldn’t have even imagined that 
you will become my fate, Afnan. Why are you crying so much? It is not the time to cry. I am not crying, these are the tears of joy. Last night, I tried a lot to call you but I didn’t get a chance and I didn’t want Alizey to have 
any sort of doubt. Yes, but I waited for you all night. Yes, I know but trust me, I have come to 
meet you directly from the office. Even I wanted to meet you 
as soon as possible. I had a lot of important meetings 
but I said no, I will first go and meet my Ramsha then we will decide something. Hey what are you doing, no. What happened, Afnan? I don’t like that you touch 
my shoes like this. Really? But I would really like it 
if I do all your work. Do you know, Afnan, I really wanted to do all your work, I am your wife anyway and 
you have the most right on me. Why are you looking at me like this? I was thinking that there is so much
difference between you and Alizey. Afnan, the difference is not between 
me and Alizey, it is between our knowledge. What does that mean? I mean that I am way behind Alizey when it comes
to worldly education but I have learned the knowledge 
of religion, our religion teaches us that if a wife 
will make her husband the King of the house, her own position will be of a queen. I am so lucky to have a 
religious wife like you. Okay now go freshen up 
and I will serve food for you. yes, I don’t know you will just 
stay here today. Ramsha, please I can’t stay, try and understand, 
I have a problem. I don’t want to understand anything, 
Afnan, I will get upset with you 
if you don’t stay here today. Ramsha, look now, look now you are threatening me. Now it’s up to you if you consider this
a threat or my love. Dude, what dude? You are acting very selfishly. A person does become selfish in love 
sometimes and there is nothing wrong with it. Ramsha, look please try 
to understand me, I will get into huge trouble 
if I stay here today. Really? Okay then you go to your home but if I actually get mad at you
 for real after this, then I will never talk to you. Okay, okay, I won’t go, 
I will try to stay here. You don’t have to try, you have to 
stay here today Afnan. Okay I will stay. Thank you. 
You’re welcome. Afnan, you didn’t tell me that you are
going to Islamabad like this all of a sudden? You didn’t even tell me that 
you have a meeting and you are going for 2 3 days. Hey, the meeting was scheduled 
a long time ago I forgot to tell you. And the Islamabad office has been
ignored for a long time as well, I thought of giving two days there, so it will take me 2 to 3 days. Okay. Why are you getting worried? I will try to come back in 2 to 3 days 
and don’t delay it any further. Okay. 
Okay I am leaving, it’s almost time for my flight. Why are you driving yourself, 
ask the driver to drop you at the airport. I am not going myself, I am asking Jamshed to drop me 
at the airport and bring the car back. okay. Uh, I am getting a call. 
Take care. Hello? What happened? You seem to be
in a rush today. No, no, why would I be in a rush? 
I am getting ready like usual. I see you getting ready daily but you are getting ready 
so much rush today. Is everything okay? Umm yes actually, 
today Mr Ahmed, you know Mr Ahmed, 
he is our very old employee, he has scheduled a very important 
and urgent meeting today, so I just don’t want to get late for it. Mr Ahmed works under you, 
you are his boss, even if you get late, 
he won’t scold you. Yes but professionally ethically 
it is not right, he is an elder, and I have to take care of his respect. 
Bye. Hey, take your bag. Oh sorry. Thank you. Bye. What was the need to bring 
such a big bag? I was thinking that I am here for 3 days but if the days extend, I should at least have clothes. You tell me do you need anything? No thank you. Wait a minute. Yes, greetings, yes, absolutely fine 
by the grace of God. Umm Yes Mr Balaj, 
do one thing deliver the car to the same address 
that I have sent you. Yes, I will also send you 
the pin location but it shouldn’t go to 
any wrong address. Thank you so much. Thanks. Congratulations Miss, your new car is coming tomorrow, I have ordered a car for you. What?
