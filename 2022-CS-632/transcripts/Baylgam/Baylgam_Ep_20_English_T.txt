[16.08] Get lost. Get out of here.
[18.48] There is no point in shedding tears,
[21.44] because you chose this path for yourself. 
Understand?
[24.72] Come on, get out.
[30.00] Come on, get out. Get out of here.
Aunt…
[37.12] Papa.
[40.04] Papa.
[42.08] Please forgive me, papa. 
I made a big mistake.
[46.96] In fact, not mistake, 
I committed a sin.
[49.04] I beg you.
[50.60] After today, I won’t do anything.
[52.68] Please forgive me. Papa. 
Nothing will happen after today.
[56.84] Forgive me, papa.
[59.76] Please, papa, forgive me.
[62.88] I beg you, papa. I made a mistake.
[66.88] Give me one chance, please.
[69.28] Ramsha,
[71.44] how dare you?
[73.04] You dared to come back to this home.
[80.16] Get out of here.
[82.28] Get out.
[84.08] You are dead for us.
[85.92] What are you saying?
[87.28] I am absolutely right, sister in law.
[89.44] Whatever she has done,
[92.12] the consequence of it is that 
we take her life standing here.
[96.92] Don’t say that.
[99.04] Uncle, you can kill me,
[102.32] but I will not go anywhere from here.
[104.24] Did you not hear what I said, Ramsha?
[105.60] Get out. Leave.
[108.72] Uncle, please…
[109.80] Don’t say it.
[112.08] Don’t call me your uncle.
[114.48] I am dead for you.
[120.64] Do you know?
[122.36] Because of you a scene
 was created out of us,
[126.20] our respect was made fun of.
[134.52] I don’t want
[136.60] that before another scene is created,
[138.68] Ramsha leave from here. Leave.
[141.52] No. Uncle.
[143.40] Uncle, I have no other home,
 where will I go?
[146.24] Did you not hear what papa said?
[147.88] Come on, get lost from here.
[149.60] No.
[150.44] Yes, come on, get out of here.
[152.36] Whatever, you have gone through,
[154.44] whatever pain you tolerated, no one
 has a fault in this, it is all your doing.
[167.52] Mama, she is really stubborn, 
she won’t understand like this.
[169.84] I will have to drag her out. 
Come on.
[172.16] For God’s sake.
[173.80] No. Papa…
Stop.
[182.28] She will not go anywhere.
[196.16] Brother Sajid, what are you saying?
[199.32] How can she live here in 
the presence of my young daughter?
[202.72] This girl is not worthy 
of keeping in this home.
[205.04] Salma,
[206.44] who are you to drag 
my daughter out of my home?
[209.72] Sister in law, 
why would we keep this girl here?
[212.60] She is not a girl.
[226.72] She is my daughter.
[228.36] My daughter.
[241.68] She agreed to her father getting
 defamed in front of the world.
[245.80] Fine.
[250.36] But I don’t accept that 
my daughter is dragged out of my home.
[259.44] Do you understand?
[272.28] Mehnaz,
[277.16] take her inside.
[397.72] Hey, you get everything without 
me asking for it. Live long.
[408.04] Brother did you talk to Afnan?
[412.20] I couldn’t talk to Afnan.
[414.52] Once I am done with this work,
 I will talk to him.
[420.80] Brother, I feel that 
we should get these two married now.
[428.36] Yes, so if you feel this way, 
then I have no objections. Fine.
[436.48] Fine, then when Afnan comes, 
you ask him and fix a date for next month.
[442.88] Will you women be able to make
 your preparation in a month?
[448.28] What preparation, brother?
[450.48] Both children are from our home.
[454.48] You were saying that 
you have to fulfill your desire.
[458.96] Anyway, I am happy in
 whatever you are happy with.
[460.76] The tea is really good.
[462.96] Here you go.
[465.12] You are not having tea?
[466.68] No brother, I just had tea.
[478.20] Elder papa didn’t do the right thing.
[480.20] Earlier he was saying a lot,
 he was getting really angry,
[483.32] but as soon as his daughter came in front of him, 
his love for his child awoke.
[489.96] Shani, you stay quiet.
[492.40] Your father has gone to talk to elder papa.
[494.76] So they will decide whether they have 
to keep Ramsha at the home or not.
[497.20] They will decide this.
[499.32] You stay away from this matter.
[501.16] Why should I stay away?
[502.60] Did the elders only get insulted,
 they got defamed, not me?
[506.84] See what you are saying.
[507.92] You have no idea 
what all people have said to me.
[510.52] Yes, so tell your father 
whatever you have to say.
[513.40] Don’t say it to me.
[515.56] After all, even I am not in favour 
of keeping that girl at home.
[518.72] Yes, so what is the delay for? 
Drag her out.
[520.96] Your father has gone to talk. 
Let him come back.
[524.64] Then we will know 
what decision will be made.
[555.76] I…
[559.00] brother, I want to talk to 
you about something.
[563.76] Go ahead.
[569.16] Brother, don’t mind what I say, but
[574.20] I feel that you are forgetting
 the defamation of this home in your daughter’s love.
[586.68] I don’t want to talk about this matter.
[589.72] Brother, maybe you have no idea 
what you are saying.
[595.88] I have a really good idea
[598.72] what I am doing and saying.
[603.56] Because I am Ramsha’s father,
[607.32] not her uncle.
[609.92] What?
[616.88] No brother, no.
[619.60] I didn’t expect this from you.
[624.28] If Ramsha was your daughter,
[629.48] then what would you have done, Anwar?
[634.16] Me?
[637.60] Brother if Ramsha was my daughter
[641.08] and had she trampled my respect like this,
[644.84] then I would have murdered her.
[651.68] I would have killed her.
[672.00] That’s the difference.
[677.00] May God never show anyone this day.
[693.44] Salma. 
Yes?
[696.24] I wanted to talk to you.
[697.84] Yes, go ahead.
[701.24] Anwar used to sit with everyone
 and have breakfast,
[704.84] now he is sitting in his room
 and having breakfast?
[710.28] Forgive me, sister,
[712.32] the environment of the home is not such 
that everyone can sit together.
[716.00] Even we can have problems 
because of your Ramsha.
[720.04] But you people never thought of
 anyone other than your daughter.
[724.68] We were the fools that we never 
differentiated between these two children.
[764.96] Mama, you leave it, I will make tea.
[772.32] You don’t need to bother at all.
[775.36] My hands and feet are fine,
 I will make tea myself.
[780.32] You are upset with me?
[784.60] No.
[786.72] I am really happy.
[789.64] My daughter achieved such a big feat,
[793.72] she has won the gold medal,
 the neighbours are praising her.
[797.60] Why would I be upset? 
I am really happy.
[803.04] I know I have given 
a lot of pain to all of you.
[809.80] I am really embarrassed, 
please forgive me.
[812.92] What difference does you
 being embarrassed matter?
[817.00] You know, me and your father are tired of
giving clarification and lying to the neighbours.
[823.80] Mama, I promise you,
[826.60] whatever you and papa say after today, 
however you say it, I will do it.
[832.40] But please,
 forgive me and give me a chance.
[835.68] Please.
[839.20] If someone breaks someone’s trust once,
[844.92] then they are not trusted again.
[884.96] Did you see?
[887.04] Getting angry doesn’t really make a 
difference to brother Sajid and sister in law.
[892.44] If it had to make a difference it 
would have happened a long time back,
[894.68] and you burning your blood for no reason
 and they are sitting comfortably.
[897.12] So what do I do?
[899.12] What do I do?
[901.24] Brother Sajid is not listening to me.
[905.08] At least,
[906.64] you make sister in law understand.
[908.36] There is no point in making 
sister in law understand.
[911.16] Thank God, Ramsha has come back home.
[915.28] People have shut up
[917.84] or else every person was asking 
how long will Ramsha stay at her aunt’s home?
[924.32] When will she come from her aunt’s home?
[926.44] You only care that you got rid of it.
[931.36] I have to step out.
[934.44] I have to live the world. 
I have to face the world.
[939.92] What they say,
[942.12] pinch me on the inside. 
On the inside!
[948.76] God damn it,
[951.36] if a girl stays out of the home one night, 
all hell breaks loose.
[956.64] Here, God knows 
how many nights she spent outside.
[959.40] And what sort of parents are they, 
it makes no difference to them.
[963.92] Okay. You leave all this,
 you have food.
[966.08] I am warning you, Salma.
[969.72] Make your daughter understand.
[972.64] I shouldn’t see this girl 
Annie around Ramsha.
[978.08] If this happens,
[980.36] then she will see the worst in me.
[982.48] Don’t worry.
[984.20] I have made Annie understand well, 
before you asked me.
[988.68] Now you don’t worry, have food.
[991.68] What do I eat?
[993.92] I am unable to eat due to
 the environment of the home.
[1001.12] Food. Food.
[1014.84] I don’t understand anything, Afnan.
[1017.76] No person in the home 
is willing to talk to me.
[1022.32] What do I do?
[1025.96] You please pray for me,
[1029.20] that,
[1030.72] God makes it easy for me.
[1037.88] Yes.
[1040.16] Okay, I will talk to you later.
[1043.52] Goodbye.
[1048.72] Annie.
[1063.40] Annie,
[1065.24] are you too upset 
with me like everyone else?
[1069.40] I admit I made a big mistake
[1074.40] and
[1075.64] don’t you believe that
 I realize my mistake?
[1081.24] I will answer every 
question of yours Ramsha,
[1084.60] but before that you
 will have to answer my questions.
[1091.48] Why don’t girls like you 
think before running from home,
[1094.88] that after them running away,
[1098.04] their sisters, the girls of their home will have to
 bear the consequences of them running away.
[1107.44] What happened Ramsha?
[1110.00] Why are you looking away?
[1115.64] You ran away from home,
[1118.48] but I suffered the punishment for your sin.
[1124.08] Everything of mine got restricted.
[1127.52] Coming and going.
[1130.28] Talking on the phone.
[1133.92] To the extent, that I was even 
stopped from combined studies.
[1141.60] You left the home.
[1143.56] You fulfilled your wishes.
[1146.96] I was even deprived of my needs.
[1153.72] I wish you were not this selfish.
[1161.00] I wish you had not run
 after your unruly wishes.
[1165.20] I wish…
[1167.32] I wish you had not left all the relations.
[1170.76] Because of you so many mothers 
would lose trust in their daughters
[1174.00] and so many brothers
 lose their trust in their sisters.
[1189.44] To the extent that they 
are even deprived of their studies.
[1294.92] You know there is something. 
Yes?
[1297.36] You must not have missed me, right?
[1301.96] How did you find out?
[1305.20] Just like that.
[1307.08] But this time, I really missed you.
[1314.36] Seriously?
[1316.88] No, no, you are joking
[1321.48] or are you speaking the truth?
[1324.16] Yes, I am speaking the truth.
[1329.04] Oh wow,
[1331.32] this was so unexpected.
[1333.72] This means you know my worth.
[1335.80] Yes, a little. This much.
[1337.96] Yes, this little bit of 
care of yours is enough for me.
[1345.52] So thank you.
[1348.04] The pleasure is all mine.
[1350.04] Okay come on, quickly finish your food,
 you have to drop me too.
[1352.96] Where?
[1354.12] To Sara, I had told you.
[1355.92] Hey,
[1357.00] we have come together after so long, 
you are not going anywhere.
[1359.80] You are spending time with me. 
I have to talk to you about a lot of things.
[1362.56] Afnan, she must be waiting for me.
[1364.08] Hey, if she is waiting, then let her.
[1366.00] I don’t care.
[1366.88] Call her and tell her you are busy,
 you have a meeting.
[1371.20] In fact, why do you have to lie? 
Tell her you are with me, that’s it.
[1377.36] What has happened to you today?
[1382.68] Something really special happened today.
[1386.00] Today, after a long time...
[1389.00] ...you made me realize
 that you too love me.
[1394.16] So, I feel great.
[1396.04] So I want to spend as much
 time as I can with you today.
[1401.88] A lot of time.
[1416.36] Shameless girl.
[1418.12] Are you not ashamed?
[1419.56] You are holding my hand in
 the crowded restaurant? Girl.
[1424.00] I am not ashamed at all today.
[1455.76] Mehnaz.
[1461.48] Mehnaz, bring me a cup of tea.
[1476.08] Papa, your tea.
[1484.28] Mehnaz.
[1490.92] Yes. Yes. Coming.
[1496.24] Yes.
[1497.92] Do you have idea how long
 I have been here for?
[1500.20] I was cleaning the room.
[1504.68] Clean the room later, bring tea for me.
[1508.92] Papa, I just made tea.
[1513.48] Bring tea for me in the room.
[1564.28] Rashid, I will take care of this, 
you take care of the hedges.
[1566.88] Water it. Yes, there. There.
[1570.36] Fine, sir.
[1572.72] Greetings uncle. 
Greetings.
[1574.52] Greetings dad.
[1576.08] Where are you coming from, children?
[1577.32] Dad, Alizay wanted to shop a little, 
so I took her to the mall.
[1581.36] Okay. Okay.
[1582.64] Alizay, child.
[1584.40] Yes?
[1585.52] When you go out,
[1588.84] then cover yourself with a veil or scarf.
[1591.56] Wear a loose dress.
 It doesn’t look reasonable like this, okay?
[1630.20] I will have to drag her out. 
Come on.
[1632.32] For God’s sake. 
No. Papa…
[1634.08] Stop.
[1640.80] She will not go anywhere.
[1644.20] Brother Sajid, what are you saying?
[1646.96] How can she live here in
 the presence of my young daughter?
[1650.40] This girl is not worthy
of keeping in this home.
[1652.72] Salma, who are you to drag 
my daughter out of my home?
[1657.40] Sister in law, why would 
we keep this girl here?
[1660.64] She is not a girl.
[1673.68] She is my daughter. My daughter.
[1682.24] She agreed to her father getting 
defamed in front of the world.
[1686.32] Fine.
[1690.84] But I don’t accept that my daughter
 is dragged out of my home.
[1712.12] Papa, your tea.
[1720.20] Mehnaz.
[1724.48] Yes. Yes. Coming.
[1730.00] Yes.
[1731.68] Do you have idea 
how long I have been here for?
[1734.24] I was cleaning the room.
[1737.92] Clean the room later, bring tea for me.
[1741.96] Papa, I just made tea.
[1746.60] Bring tea for me in the room.
[1794.80] Papa.
[1797.20] Papa, I am not able to
 tolerate you being upset.
[1801.44] You have kept me at home,
[1804.84] but you have taken me 
out of your heart.
[1812.36] Till you don’t forgive me, 
my heart will not find peace.
[1817.44] I know I made a big mistake.
[1820.40] I committed a big sin,
[1823.96] I made your head bow down,
[1827.76] I broke your trust,
[1831.44] I embarrassed everyone.
[1842.64] I should have been 
a source of pride for you,
[1849.84] but I became a source of regret.
[1854.60] I am not a good daughter.
[1858.12] Papa, forgive me.
[1860.76] Forgive me.
[1863.64] I am apologizing with my heart, 
please forgive me.
[1867.72] If you don’t forgive me,
then I will die, papa.
[1872.56] Forgive me.
[1881.84] Child, these relations 
are like ears on your face.
[1896.20] Even if you cut off one ear,
[1899.32] your own face becomes hideous.
[1915.56] I have forgiven you.
[1923.12] No.
[1925.12] You have not forgiven me.
[1928.20] You have just saved me.
[1934.32] You have saved me from
 the insult that had become my fate.
[1939.92] It would have ruined and defamed me.
[1942.44] You didn’t forgive me.
[1945.12] Forgive me, papa.
[1947.96] Forgive me with your heart…
Come on, get up.
[1950.88] Get up. Sit.
[1955.52] Papa.
[1957.00] Papa, forgive me with your heart.
[1964.64] I really cannot find peace.
[1966.44] If you don’t forgive me, I will die.
[1970.56] Forgive me.
[1972.56] Please forgive me, papa.
[1974.88] Give me another chance.
[1976.44] I will not do anything after this.
[1978.24] Forgive me with your heart, please.
[1980.56] Please, papa.
[1987.24] You are stubborn since childhood,
[1992.08] after all, you are my daughter.
[2001.24] I forgave you with my heart, child.
[2040.68] Mama, you always take uncle’s side.
[2044.12] Child, what is there to take his side on?
[2047.04] If brother stops you from something,
[2050.72] then it has your betterment.
[2053.68] Mama, I know what is better for me well.
[2056.04] He doesn’t have to teach me.
[2061.56] Lower your voice, Alizay.
[2063.88] If brother hears you, he will be hurt.
[2066.36] It is better that he hears me.
[2068.24] Mama, getting married in no way means
 that I compromise on everything.
[2072.32] I have my own lifestyle, my own life.
[2076.52] This is not a compromise,
[2078.56] this is obedience and after all,
[2081.68] every girl adapts according to her in-laws.
[2084.84] Right now, you thank God
[2086.36] that you don’t have a mother and sister in law 
or girls compromise on everything.
[2093.00] Leave it, mama.
[2094.64] Uncle is no less than a mother in law.
[2097.08] He is playing the role of
 both a father and mother in law.
[2105.32] Okay, enough.
[2106.80] Relax.
[2126.24] Here you go son, water.
[2130.00] Tell elder papa that 
Ramsha won’t go to university now.
[2134.00] Shani,
[2136.20] her parents are alive to make this decision.
[2141.28] You don’t need to worry about this.
[2144.12] Yes, so if it was in their control,
[2145.40] they would make her sit on their
 heads despite the defamation.
[2150.88] Now whatever is to be done, 
we have to do it ourselves.
[2152.60] Don’t talk too much.
Quietly eat your food.
[2154.88] The elders are there in the home.
[2158.00] When the elders are not able to do anything, 
then the young ones have to do it.
[2161.36] I should even talk to you.
[2162.88] You have no manners 
on how to talk to elders.
[2166.96] Meaning, now you will judge
 the capabilities of your elders,
[2170.80] you have grown up so big?
[2171.88] Sit down.
[2172.84] Sit down.
[2176.24] Hear one thing,
[2177.88] don’t you dare speak 
a word in this regards.
[2181.68] Understand?
[2185.48] I don’t want that my son 
becomes part of the curses of others.
[2191.96] I don’t know what sort of old 
fashioned thinking you have.
[2213.68] Sister in law. 
Yes?
[2215.32] Will you go to the three day
 mourning of Rashida’s mother in law?
[2219.92] Yes,
[2221.08] I will go, because 
I couldn’t go to the funeral.
[2224.04] When will you go?
[2225.40] There is just some work in the kitchen,
 let me finish this, then we will go.
[2228.80] Yes, I too will cook these vegetables, 
then we will go.
[2234.72] Sister in law. 
Yes?
[2237.16] If someone over there 
asks about Ramsha,
[2240.28] what will you say?
[2244.80] Salma,
[2247.36] if you don’t want to go 
with me because of Ramsha,
[2250.52] then no issues, you go alone.
 I will not go.
[2253.36] No, no, sister in law.
[2254.72] There is nothing like that.
[2255.96] I just asked, and if you don’t have an issue,
 then what problem can I have?
[2284.40] What are you still doing here? 
Did you not leave?
[2287.08] I am waiting for sister in law,
 she has gone to get ready.
[2290.96] Okay listen,
[2292.68] cook rice and send it on the shop.
[2296.48] I have had a pain in 
my stomach for the past two days.
[2299.84] Okay, fine.
[2301.04] I was anyway saying that 
I will cook food from home and send it.
[2306.76] Okay tell me,
[2309.80] should I send some pickles 
or something with the rice?
[2312.60] Are you out of your mind?
[2315.12] I am telling you 
I have pain in my stomach
[2317.24] and you are saying that you will 
send pickles and sauce with the rice?
[2321.60] I just want rice, that’s it.
[2323.72] Okay, fine.
[2324.76] Let’s go papa.
[2325.96] Yes.
[2326.68] Annie,
[2327.92] I will send Shani at 4 pm, 
you come back with him.
[2332.56] Don’t sit there 
and talk with your friends.
[2335.56] Study and finish all the work
 and come back straight home.
[2339.92] Finish all the work.
[2341.28] I will not let you go to your 
friends’ home again and again.
[2343.40] Sure mama. Come on, 
papa, we are getting late.
[2346.20] What are you still doing here? 
Why did you not go to the shop?
[2349.80] I was just leaving, papa.
[2351.24] You were not leaving, leave already.
[2354.52] Arshad must be waiting
 for you in warehouse.
[2357.88] And listen to me,
[2359.40] you have to go to pick up your 
sister from her friend’s home at 4 pm.
[2366.60] Do you have no other work?
[2368.32] Do you just have to go visit friends?
[2371.76] I am going to study, 
I am not going for an outing.
[2375.28] I had asked papa to get me an
admission in the coaching center,
[2377.88] but no one listens to me.
[2379.60] Okay, so that you can go out using
 the coaching as an excuse.
[2384.36] Come on, Annie. 
We are getting late.
[2386.96] Come on.
[2389.48] Get up. Get up. Go to the shop.
[2392.08] I am coming. I am coming, papa.
[2393.20] Goodbye.

mother in law, we are going there.
