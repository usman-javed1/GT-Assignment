How can I let you get off? You think you are going to get
 off the car in this attire at this time of the night 
and I will let you? Really? I guess you have forgotten, you left me the very 
same way mid-way. Why do you worry if 
I am marrying Shani today? If I will stand on the road 
in the middle of the night, why do you worry? Why? Because, I know that I have made
 a huge mistake. I didn’t value you
 and your love but trust me since the day I realized it I have spent every 
moment in so much pain but, but that doesn’t mean you should ruin your life like this. Once, just once say it to me that you don’t want to do this marriage, I will support you and stand by you. What is wrong with you, Afnan? What are you even saying? Why are you causing 
me hurt and pain? Whatever you are saying
 is causing me pain, Afnan, for God’s sake, just keep quiet and take me to the hall, it has already been so late, if we get late anymore, I will once again get 
dishonored because of you. I won’t let any of that happen, I promise, just say the truth once, just gather the strength 
and tell me, I will stand by you and Shani won’t be able 
to say anything to you, I… What has happened to you? Why are you saying all this? Why are you hurting me and causing me pain
 by saying all this? Because I want to marry you. God has willed.
 God has willed. Wow, you look so handsome. Come on now give money to your 
sister for applying kohl. I will take complete Rs10,000 10,000? What happened? 
Did you skip a heartbeat? It is a happy occasion, don’t act miser, give her 10,000 today, and by the way you will get a lot of such 10,000s 
in your wedding money. Okay so no matter if you get 
the wedding money or not it is the right of sisters. Don’t make excuses, 
quickly give it to her. Okay, okay, take it, you will remember forever. 10,000, I will have to count. Wow. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10!!! Wow, wow, now give it to me, else you will lose it, it is the wedding occasion, you will drop it somewhere, you can take it from me later.
 Give it to me. I need them back. Give it to me, I will return all of these 
10,000 back to you. Now don’t get late, Mr. Qasim said don’t get late,
 be there in time. Yes, yes, you are 
absolutely right and Mr. Qasim is very punctual, he will get upset if we get late. Let’s go, let’s go. Where did you go? Nowhere, had some important work
 so I went to do that. Is that important 
work done then? No. Today, for the first time 
I got a deal in life that I was unable to fulfill. I failed. I came back empty handed. It’s okay Afnan, such things happen in business, please don’t get upset. Come, let’s go together and 
get a picture taken. No, no, I won’t come. No, Afnan, let’s go. I am telling you that I am
 not in the mood at all. Afnan, let’s go. Where are you going? Mr. Qasim has given the envelope
 of wedding money to Shani, the envelope seems quite
 heavy with money, let me go and check how 
much money is there. What is wrong with you? You will check the envelope
 in front of everyone? It will look bad, 
do it when you get home. Okay fine, do one thing, go ask Madam Afsheen to start the process
 of bidding farewell, we are getting late. Finally, the fish has 
been caught in the net. What was that nursery rhyme
 we would listen to as a child? The fish one? yes.. fish is the queen of water, water is her life, if you touch her, 
she gets scared, if you take her out, 
she will die. By the way, you know what? Even I used to think as 
a child about what it meant, today, I understand it. Who is it at this time? Who is it? Shani? Dad? I will be right back, okay? Yes dad? Dude, actually I wanted to say that where is the wedding money? I have it, do you need it right now? Yes, bring it. The envelope that
 Mr. Qasim gave, is amongst them, right? Go bring it, good boy. Quickly. This was Mr. Qasim one, right? Yes dad, these are all of them. All of it? yes, Dad, all of it, let me know if you
 need anything else. Shut the door. Do it, do it. Dad ruined the whole mood. I mean is this the time to come 
and ask for the wedding money? I mean, he doesn’t trust his son, would I spend all the 
wedding money at this time? It is the limit. He ruined the whole mood. Anyway, forget it, tell me something what 
were we talking about? Do you know I never even thought 
this would happen. Ramsha. Afnan. Have a seat. Umm hand. Sorry. Look at me. Hey? Look at me. yes? If you weren’t important to me, I wouldn’t be here today. what is wrong with you, Afnan? You love me, if you won’t marry me, then who else will you marry? What is wrong with you? I just talked to you nicely
 a couple of times, does that mean 
I will marry you? You didn’t just talk to
 me nicely a couple of times, you have always
 taken care of me, and this is not a friendship, you have been 
concerned for me, and you saved me from trouble. I just showed sympathy 
towards you, I thought that she is 
probably a naïve girl who might need 
my guidance and if I can make 
her a good friend and guide her, save 
her from bad people, so this was not love, that doesn’t mean, 
I want to marry you. You have gotten after me, and why would I marry you? Who are you? What do you even have in you? Did you leave your studies? I have no clue about 
your family at all and you, you upload your 
videos on social media so you can get famous and I will marry you? Hey, you even 
left your parents, you didn’t even care 
about their honor, how will you ever
 care about mine? You didn’t value my sister, she used to love you 
beyond any limits, she was so sincere to you, you didn’t believe her. I know that she was carefree, I know she was emotional but for you, she was crazy for you. She was very crazy about getting
 famous in showbiz and earning money, but you were more than
 her craze for her. Hey, wow, God has willed, 
by the grace of God, such an amazing breakfast? You even made everything 
such early morning? No, I didn’t make anything, brother Qasim has sent all of this. His servant dropped it. Have a seat. Oh wow. Amazing. By the way, Mr. Qasim is an amazing man,
 bravo to him, he is not our relative but look how he is fulfilling
 the relationship. Brother Qasim is a very nice man else why would anyone do all this
 for a stranger these days? What is wrong with you? Mr. Qasim is a very elegant man, he has made Ramsha his daughter, now that he is fulfilling
 the relationship why do you have 
a problem with that? Hmm, I was just saying. I don’t want to hear this from
 your mouth ever again, you should be happy that our son has become a son-in-law
 to such a rich man, I have accepted Mr. Qasim as
 my son’s father-in-law from the heart, you must do it too. Good, now let’s begin. Greetings. Greetings. Annie, my child, go and call
 Ramsha and Shani, I have laid the breakfast 
it will get cold. Go quickly. okay Mom, I will call them. Hey, wait let the bride and groom come 
for whom this breakfast is here. They will keep on coming, bride and groom, don’t know when they will come, why should I let
 my breakfast get cold? You must start too. Oh wow, donut, I have seen it after so long. Afsheen, ask Ramsha to check 
my blood pressure and sugar because if I eat something 
first then she will say that I ate without getting my blood 
pressure and sugar checked. Call her. Brother, how can Ramsha come? She is not here, she has been married 
and gone to her home. Oh yes, look Afsheen, 
I didn’t remember, she daily checks my blood 
pressure and sugar and even gives me 
medicines punctually at night so since she wasn’t there, no one even gave
 me medicines. Anyway. Brother, I asked Alizeh to
 give you medicines, I guess she was tired so she must have forgotten. You must ask Alizeh
 if you have any work. Yes, I have to ask Alizeh, Ramsha would do it herself. I am getting the breakfast served, 
brother, you may come. Okay, yes, get the breakfast served. I, Ramsha, do not want to marry you. And how did you even think that I, such a beautiful girl 
would marry you? Ramsha, I love you. To hell with your love, I have shown you your 
place in person today, next time if you even talk about love, I will humiliate you in front of everyone so that you will remember it for life. You can only dream about
 a beautiful girl like me, Mr. Shani, not in your life for real! Do keep that in your mind! Are you insane? You know it very well that I have no interest in you, Shani. I can bear the pain of dishonor, but a pain like you, I pray that God never 
writes you in anyone’s fate. Even if you will be the
 last man on the earth, I still won’t marry you. You didn’t remind me that I had to give you the 
wedding night gift. You look very pretty. I don’t know how long 
I have been waiting for this day. Your wedding gift. This is your wedding gift.
