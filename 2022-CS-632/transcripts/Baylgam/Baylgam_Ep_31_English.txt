I actually wanted to say 
that as you know this world cannot see anyone smiling 
and laughing before they talk and brainwash Shani, 
I want that if you may allow, let us get Ramsha and Shani married. How about we get them married 
this Friday sister-in-law? Uncle, what is the rush? What is wrong with you, Ramsha? You shouldn’t interfere 
when elders are talking. Hey, no, no sister-in-law, you, you don’t stop her, she is a little girl, she is naïve, she has gone through a huge trauma so it is only fair to have a bit of bitterness 
in her temperament. Umm, so what is your decision then? Okay Anwar, whatever you think is right. And by the way, Ramsha’s all wedding preparations 
are complete, I just have to buy a few little things so I will do that. Hey sister-in-law, no, no, don’t embarrass me, you don’t have to bother, whatever our daughter needs, I and Salma 
will bring it for her our self, just don’t worry at all. Umm, it’s just that I wanted 
to say one more thing, I want their marriage to happen 
with simplicity, yes, we will invite the whole family 
at the reception, you know since your daughter Ramsha’s 
wedding has been called off, we have been unable 
to satisfy the family, I don’t want the family to come 
to the marriage ceremony and things go sideways, I will just invite a couple of friends and let’s do the wedding ceremony 
with simplicity. Okay. congratulations sister-in-law, here have tea. You have it. 
Yes, I will. I wish brother was alive so he would 
have been so happy. May God grants him the highest level 
in heaven. Amen. 
Amen. Bashir? yes madam? Ask the driver to get the car out. 
Okay. Umm, Af.. Afnan, I was coming to you 
only I wanted to talk. Did you talk to mom? No, but Alizeh I wanted to ask 
something from you and I want you to give me 
a completely honest answer. Ask? Do you not want to marry me? Do you not like me? What do you mean? I mean to say that is it that do you like someone else and you are just marrying me 
because of pressure from aunt? You are doubting me? I am just asking a question. I cannot believe that is what you think
about me, Afnan? So why don’t you respond? Do you like someone else? If I would like someone else, Afnan, I will accept it here in front of you, I won’t keep any doubts 
in my heart like you. I have just asked you a question. It is not a question, you are putting
an allegation on me. What? What is going on here? Ask your nephew, he thinks I am involved with someone else. Can’t believe it. Afnan, what am I hearing? Nothing aunt, I just asked her a question, she is having some misunderstanding. you are doubting my daughter? How can you even think like that about me? the sad part is that you don’t even believe me. What were you doing outside? A friend came so 
I went to drop her to the door. Don’t you understand? I have told you so many times
 to not go to the gate. I don’t want to see you at the gate next time,
do you understand? And yes, we are about to get married so fix your behavior because I won’t tolerate all this 
after marriage. Mom, mom, I need to talk to you 
about something. Come here, come sit with me, 
even I want to talk to you, in fact I was just coming to your room. Look at this, Salma has sent 
the wedding dress for you, it is very beautiful and 
this color will suit you a lot. You will look very beautiful 
when you wear this. Ramsha, do you know that I had a strange fear in my heart, I used to think that whether I will even get a chance 
to see you as a bride while I am alive or would there ever be 
a chance that you are happily married 
while I am still alive, but I can’t believe it, this is the biggest happiness of my life, I am very happy my child, all my fears have gone away and the fear that I had about 
you leaving this house after marriage and then how will I live here, 
that fear has gone too. You will be very happy. Oh God! While speaking, I totally forgot that you were here to talk about something,
you wanted to say something to me. Nothing mom, you just always have to pray for me. is that something you need to say? Moms always pray for their children and for you, for you, I pray with every breath I take. It has been just a few days 
to your father’s death, I thought of marrying you 
in a simple ceremony but Salma did so many preparations 
in a couple of days. Salma is very nice, my child, your aunt is actually very nice and nowadays it is very lucky of you 
to get such a mother-in-law, what can be bigger than this? She will keep you very happy and all my fears and frights 
have gone away now, now wipe your tears, okay? Stop crying and go and 
try your wedding dress, if there are any measurement issues, 
we will get it fixed, okay? Take this with you. Usually, girls say that marry me 
for my sake, they cry, they beg, they request and you are telling me 
not to marry you for your sake? It’s unbelievable. Afnan, you are very selfish. Look if I will be strong and independent, it’s good for both of us. I wanted to ask something from you and I want you to give me a completely 
honest answer. Ask? Do you not want to marry me? Do you not like me? What do you mean? I mean to say that is it that do you like someone else and you are just marrying me 
because of pressure from aunt? You are doubting me? I am just asking a question. I cannot believe that is what you think 
about me, Afnan? So why don’t you respond? Do you like someone else? If I would like someone else, Afnan, I will accept it here in front of you, I won’t keep any doubts 
in my heart like you. Alizeh, you have misinterpreted 
what Afnan said. Mom, I was sure that as always, 
you will defend Afnan. I know that his way of talking was wrong, he shouldn’t have asked like this, look this is not what he meant, trust me. You trusted him, mom, 
I don’t want to trust him. Don’t force me for everything. But you have hurt Afnan. I have hurt Afnan? And what about how he has hurt me? It doesn’t make any difference to you, 
or anyone, whether it’s you or him. I think you are very tired right now, it will be better if you go 
to your room and rest, you are disliking anything 
that I say right now, we will talk later. Greetings brother. Greetings, May peace be upon you. Hey Afnan didn’t come back 
from office yet? What? Though he is usually back by this time. Exactly, even I am worried now, if there is any work or meeting, 
he usually calls me, he didn’t even inform me. My mobile ran out of battery,
 you call him and ask. I will ask him, but don’t worry, I will… Let me know. I hope everything is all right. What is this, Ramsha? Why did you refuse the henna girl? Will it look nice if a bride doesn’t 
have henna on her hands? Annie, I didn’t feel like it. And by the way, who will do all the house chores
if I get henna applied? I will do the house chores, I am a sister of both bride and groom, so I have two relationships, so I will do all the chores, 
just get henna applied. I don’t feel like getting it applied, 
Annie, don’t force me. Ramsha, are you happy 
to marry brother? I don’t know Annie, I don’t know myself what am I feeling, I just know that I have to fulfill this relationship 
under any circumstances whether I am happy or not. Actually, you guys never had 
any understanding so that is why his behavior was always 
like this with you. You were his cousin but now 
you will be his wife so automatically his relationship 
will get better with you and he will start behaving well with you. Ramsha, this is your jewelry, I gave rest of the stuff to sister-in-law. And yes, Annie, did you call Ayesha? When will she come to do her makeup? Yes, yes, mom, she said 
she will come early so she must be here anytime now. Look into it, do remind her on call, your dad is always in a rush, 
he will get very upset if it gets late. Okay mom, now she is coming you must get ready 
and do get henna applied, okay? try to understand, the situation has changed now. So, did you forget what Shani did to me? I didn’t forget anything, I remember everything, you leaving this house, your marriage being called off and then your dad passing away 
due to this news, and then whatever Shani did taking 
advantage of all these matters, I remember everything, 
I haven’t forgotten anything, I haven’t forgotten anything. Hey Shani, how are you son? Hey uncle, how are you?
 Greetings. Greetings. My child, I have heard you are getting
married to Sajid’s daughter today? Yes uncle. That’s amazing that 
you are marrying your cousin, it will be a very good deed for you. And by the way, who asks such girl 
after such dishonor and after one’s father passes away. Your dad made a very good decision, I just pray you are always happy, may God keep you happy 
and blessed son. Bye. What? What is there to laugh about? What should I do if not laugh? I thought that the neighborhood is joking when they said your dad is 
marrying you to your cousin but your dad actually made you 
a sacrificial animal. By the way, Shani, you don’t have to go out for 
entertainment now, you will be entertained at home. He is absolutely right, and your video might get viral
 to this way and there will be a lot of fun and games. By the way, do one thing, tell me the Instagram and 
TikTok account of sister-in-law, we might get famous like that too. I told you not to joke about this. Shani, listen? I am joking. Shani. Hey look at him, dude. Ramsha? Mom, what do you do? You have been busy with work 
since morning, I am watching you, you must take some care of yourself too. Oh, I will rest, my child, 
do one thing, have milk, you never know how much time 
it takes in the wedding ceremony and the ceremonies after that. You haven’t eaten anything 
since morning, you won’t feel hungry if you have milk. I am not hungry already mom. Anyway, are you feeling okay, mom? Yes, everything is fine but I don’t know why I have a headache
since morning. Why mom? 
Didn’t you take your medicine? No, I didn’t, I forgot taking the medicine amidst 
all the house chores. Mom, you are… You have been taking care of 
everyone since morning you just forgot taking care of yourself. Why don’t you take care 
of yourself in time? Go and have medicine and rest for a while,
please mom, take care of yourself. Okay, okay don’t worry 
I will take medicines. Are you mad? You know very well that I have 
no interest in you Shani, I can go through the pain of being
dishonored but a trouble like yourself, may God never write such fate 
for anyone. I won’t even marry you if you are 
the last man in this world. it is very important for you 
to marry Ramsha. My child, once you get married 
to Ramsha, and she becomes your wife, so everything that is hers will be yours,
 you will be the owner, that is why whatever I am saying, just consider it with cool mind on it, my child, if apologizing for a bit 
will make our life, if it will bring us benefit 
then what is the harm in it? What should I do if not laugh? I thought that the neighborhood is joking when they said your dad is marrying you
 to your cousin but your dad actually made you 
a sacrificial animal. By the way, Shani, you don’t have to go out for 
entertainment now, you will be entertained at home. He is absolutely right, and your video might get viral to this way and there will be a lot of fun and games. By the way, do one thing, tell me the Instagram and 
TikTok account of sister-in-law, we might get face like that too. She went to the shop humiliated me, 
humiliated dad, she was asking us for the accountability
of the shop. So then why should I ask for it? I shouldn’t even ask for what is my right?
It is my father’s shop; I will take the accountability of 
every penny from you. Your father is dead,
do you understand? But I am alive, and until I am alive, I will take 
accountability of each and everything, I have all the right on the shop. Fear that day, she was just asking for the accounts 
of the shop today, in future she will ask the custody 
of the same shop and things won’t stop here Shani, who does this house belong 
to where you roam freely? Where you talk loudly? 
Who does this house belong to? Her, her mother, her father, nothing belongs to your father, if she throws her out of here, you won’t get anything, 
I won’t get anything either, we will be empty handed, empty. What is this? Why aren’t you ready yet? You have your wedding, come son, hurry up and get ready, good boy. Dad, my friends are making fun of me, they are calling me names, 
telling me I am shameless and yes, I am shameless that
I agreed to marry such a girl. Dude, what nonsense? Don’t think anything, 
there is nothing like that. Go, I am telling you, go, you have your wedding, 
go, good boy. Dad, you became so selfish that you don’t care about my happiness, 
my will or my respect. At least give me the right to marry 
by my own choice and happiness to a nice girl. When did I say that? When did I say that you can not marry 
by your own choice? You must definitely do it, you can do the second marriage, no one will stop you. Look, just marry Ramsha right here 
and right now, once this shop and this house gets
 in your name, then you can marry whoever you want, no one will stop you, I will get you 
married again myself. Anwar? What are you even saying? What did you say? Sister-in-law, where did you come from? 
And you heard everything? You didn’t feel any shame at all? You got so carried away with the greed that you even forgot the respect 
of your relationships? Hey, this is how you pay us back for the trust
I and your niece had on you? If your brother was alive today, he would have died 
after listening to this. At least I didn’t expect this from you, I couldn’t even think you would do this. You, you, have hurt my pride, you, you broke my trust, you have broken my dignity, Anwar, you broke my dignity. What are you thinking? You think that the poor woman’s tears 
have changed the game? No. No, son, no, the game is still in my control, mine. And I will do all that I didn’t want to do 
in order to win this game. You do what I told you, get ready, I will look into the rest. Sister-in-law? Sister-in-law? Look Ramsha, Shani and Anwar has realized 
their mistake, my child and Anwar has kept his word, he hasn’t given me any chance 
to complain by far, Anwar is regularly giving me money now and he comes and properly tells me 
all the accounts of the shop. Hey, he is even taking care of our expenses, I have no complaints from him, my child. Tell me something? 
They are our family, right? If we won’t trust them then 
who else will we trust? Just let it be mom, uncle Anwar can change so quickly? It is impossible, I know him very well, 
he is making us fool. When did I say that you cannot marry 
by your own choice? You must definitely do it, you can do the second marriage, no one will stop you. Look, just marry Ramsha right here 
and right now, once this shop and this house 
gets in your name, then you can marry whoever you want, no one will stop you, I will get you married again myself. Why did you leave, Sajid? Leaving us here to get wretched 
by this world, there is no one of my own here, how will I take care of myself 
and Ramsha? Anwar? What is this behavior? No sister-in-law, what misbehavior? I am here with so much respect 
and honor to tell you that please ask Ramsha to get ready for marriage, and come, let’s get them married, 
let’s start the ceremony, come. I have very well understood 
the greed in your intentions, and I will not sacrifice my daughter 
for your greed at all, her father died but her mother is still alive, I will never let what you want to happen. Really? Really? That is what you will do? Okay, tell me, what will you do? Yeah? I will do what’s right for my daughter. No, you cannot do anything except shedding tears. What you have to do, we will see that later, right now I will tell you what I can do.
