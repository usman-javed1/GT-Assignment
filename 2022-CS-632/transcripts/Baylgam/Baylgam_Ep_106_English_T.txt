[21.80] I don’t get it,
[24.84] What do I do with this boy?
[31.36] All his life he has done
what he wanted.
[41.56] He didn’t agree to anything I said.
[50.56] You tell me,
[52.56] what was the need for him to
go to Afnan’s home like this?
[56.64] What was the need?
[62.80] Call him.
[64.52] I will hit him two to four times,
then he will understand.
[69.16] Anwar, leave it.
[77.44] If you see him in front of you,
you will get upset further.
[84.28] Your blood pressure is high anyway.
[94.68] You know, I have scolded Shani badly
[98.32] and I have also apologized to
Ramsha for Shani’s behaviour.
[110.00] Poor Ramsha was so worried.
[112.92] Was this something
he should have done?
[122.12] He is a weird emotional boy.
[124.08] He doesn’t think or understand anything.
He went there for no reason.
[129.12] He shouldn’t have gone there
at any cost.
[137.88] He should remember
[139.80] that not only is he Ramsha’s cousin,
but he is also her ex-husband.
[150.52] How did he go to meet Afnan?
[154.24] You know,
[155.52] poor Ramsha was really worried,
she was crying.
[166.88] Anwar, she was really worried.
Now see,
[169.96] one mistake of this boy,
[172.56] one stupidity of is making everyone
suffer. Everyone is worried.
[185.68] And the people with Annie’s proposal
wanted to come over.
[191.52] Now you tell me,
we have this issue here,
[195.36] Ramsha is sitting at home.
[197.36] How do I call the people
with the proposal home?
[202.28] You just do one thing.
[204.88] You make an excuse and
avoid them.
[214.96] Them coming over here till
Ramsha is here is not right.
[221.28] Once Ramsha leaves,
we will see.
[226.72] Fine.
[228.76] These people have me worried.
[325.72] Alizeh, whether you accept it or not,
[328.08] Afnan is surely hiding something.
[330.56] I saw Shani leave from here,
and he was also angry.
[335.04] He had no colour on his face.
[337.48] Something is surely fishy.
[340.60] Mama, I too feel that
something has happened.
[345.00] I had to go to the office today, or else
I would have overheard something.
[348.72] And this Afnan won’t tell us anything.
[350.92] Obviously, why would he tell us?
[353.52] He knows if he says anything,
[356.00] we will say things to him instead.
[359.72] Mama, you call Ramsha and find out,
[362.88] you will surely find out something.
[364.76] In fact, her uncle was unwell,
[368.40] you ask about his health and
then try to talk further.
[371.92] Yes, that can be done.
[419.00] Annie?
[421.60] Annie?
[430.00] You know what? 
Aunt is right about you.
[433.12] Girls like you are trust worthy,
[436.96] I was mad that I came up to see
[439.48] if nothing wrong is happening 
to you up here,
[441.12] if you are crying or not, 
but it’s good that I came,
[443.60] at least this was an eye-opener.
[447.12] What are you saying, Afnan?
[448.92] There is nothing like this, 
you are getting it wrong,
[450.60] at least listen to me. 
I am getting it wrong?
[453.40] I, Ramsha?
[455.04] You are the one who doesn’t 
want to understand,
[458.12] I am bearing so much trouble for you,
[459.92] trying to make you understand 
with so much love,
[462.56] girls like you can never understand,
[465.04] you do what you feel like doing.
[470.24] It is my fault, it is my mistake
[473.04] that I thought that you will 
change your path
[475.36] and come back to me but no,
[479.08] the ones who have turned their faces,
[481.72] you can stop their way
[484.32] but cannot change their direction.
[534.28] Doctor, is everything okay?
[536.92] Is there something to worry about?
[540.64] No, not at all,
[541.96] there is nothing to worry about,
[559.04] thank God everything is absolutely fine.
[571.64] Many, many congratulations to you,
[573.44] she is pregnant.
[607.64] Though there is nothing to worry 
about but she is very weak,
[611.28] you have to take really
good care of her.
[614.32] I am prescribing some vitamins,
[616.28] give them to her regularly and along 
with that fresh vegetables and fruits,
[620.84] make sure you give them to her
[622.68] and then get an ultrasound 
done after 15 days.
[627.56] Thank You Doctor, 
I will buy the medicines.
[635.20] Thank you so much for giving 
such a good news,
[639.72] I got so worried.
[644.16] Let’s go, my child.
[646.88] Keep these reports safely too. 
Sure.
[669.96] What happened, Mom? 
How is Ramsha?
[672.28] My child, take out your shawl 
and sit comfortably.
[674.60] Good girl, make yourself comfortable.
[676.92] Mom, why are you smiling?
What did the doctor say?
[680.88] Sit down.
[683.12] You are about to be an Aunt 
by the grace of God.
[696.60] What?
[697.84] Thank God there is some god news
in this House.
[701.56] Many, many congratulations.
[704.48] Thank you, Annie.
[710.16] Ramsha, do one thing, call Afnan,
[714.20] it is a such a huge news, inform him,
 he will be very happy.
[725.64] Call Afnan?
[730.16] You know he wouldn’t pick up the call,
he is upset with me, Aunt.
[733.84] Why wouldn’t he?
[736.04] Call him.
[744.48] He will come running here 
when he hears this good news.
[756.32] But Aunt.
[757.56] This is the time you patch up, 
come on, call him.
[763.36] Give it to me, give it to me, 
I will talk to him, quickly give it to me.
[766.68] How will he not pick up?
[768.28] It’s a good news, 
he will come running.
[835.28] Afnan is not picking up the call.
[841.88] He is not picking up, right? 
I told you.
[888.84] Greetings, yes?
[892.28] Ramsha’s Aunt, Salma speaking.
[895.92] Yes, I recognized, tell me?
[900.12] Actually, I have been trying to 
contact Afnan for so long,
[908.92] he didn’t pick up so I thought 
he might be busy somewhere,
[918.20] so I thought I should call you and 
give you the good news.
[923.92] Good news?
[925.64] What good news?
[928.60] By the grace of God’s, along with 
being the maternal grandma,
[932.72] you are also about to become the paternal
grandma, Ramsha is expecting a baby.
[950.20] Give this message to Afnan 
on our behalf.
[963.96] You give him the good news yourself
[966.04] and tell him to have dinner
 with all of us today.
[974.16] Okay, greetings, Bye.
[990.72] Mom, what happened? 
Whose call was it?
[997.68] It was Ramsha’s aunt’s call.
[1013.00] What happened you look worried?
[1019.04] Alizeh, actually,
[1027.68] Ramsha is pregnant.
[1098.92] I suggest you throw him 
out of this house.
[1106.44] I can’t do that,
[1110.56] my hands are tied,
[1114.56] my hands are tied to the promise
[1118.64] Dad made me do before dying,
[1125.44] he gave me this responsibility
[1129.76] to take care of Ramsha always.
[1140.64] You make Alizeh understand
[1144.68] I cannot break the promise 
I made to Dad.
[1151.28] Even Alizeh has nothing to do 
since Alizeh has taken an off
[1163.00] but the difference between Ramsha 
and Alizeh is that
[1166.12] Ramsha takes care of everyone.
[1174.92] This is her love for all of us that
[1177.84] she took care of Alizeh’s feelings,
[1181.84] she cooked food that 
Alizeh felt like eating,
[1186.88] you all should have at least 
thanked Ramsha, but no problem,
[1191.24] I will do it,
[1194.20] Thank you Ramsha.
[1256.92] Here, my child, have it.
[1259.00] Yes, yes, thank you so much.
[1261.08] Hey what is this? 
it is a happy occasion,
[1268.00] come on, don’t be formal 
and have sweets.
[1272.08] Greetings.
[1274.72] Greetings.
[1276.12] My child,
[1282.44] I would have liked it had you eaten 
before you leave,
[1288.92] you always leave without having 
anything from our house.
[1292.76] Aunt, next time,
[1294.20] I have eaten at the office today.
[1297.32] Okay, no problem,
maybe next time.
[1305.20] Okay, you have to take 
very good care of Ramsha,
[1313.24] the doctor has called her, 
and she has her check-up every 15 days
[1316.00] because she is very weak.
[1327.08] What if she doesn’t have a mother,
[1329.76] but I am here,
[1337.88] just call me once if there is anything
you need me for,
[1341.92] and I am saying it to you as well.
[1345.56] Come on.
[1347.92] Shall we leave?
[1349.12] Go bring your bag.
[1350.68] I will bring my bag. 
Okay.
[1368.12] What can we do now Alizeh?
[1370.24] What had to happen, 
has already happened,
[1372.24] we are all helpless in front of fate.
[1377.72] Whenever there is some success
 in my life,
[1381.88] Ramsha comes and stands 
next to me,
[1396.20] how?
[1398.80] How does all this happen?
[1401.48] I don’t get it, Mom.
[1417.32] I feel this Ramsha is definitely 
doing some black magic,
[1426.72] else how is it possible this girl 
knows everything?
[1438.16] Mom, I don’t feel good,
[1441.00] I don’t understand 
what is happening.
[1444.04] Okay, don’t worry 
you else will get unwell.
[1448.52] Let me get unwell!
[1452.20] I was so happy mom.
[1463.00] I wanted to give Afnan 
the happiness of a child,
[1473.40] but now
[1475.24] he will also have a child from Ramsha,
[1479.64] this girl has ruined my entire happiness.
[1482.80] What are you saying, Alizeh?
[1484.60] You will be the one who gives 
the first child to Afnan.
[1497.32] And you will give the happiness
of becoming a father to Afnan,
[1500.96] why won’t he value you?
[1513.36] Umm, the rest, whatever is written 
in fate will happen any how.
[1520.36] I am telling you there is definitely 
something wrong,
[1534.08] she is definitely doing some 
black magic
[1543.68] that is why whatever she wants, 
happens.
[1547.48] God knows what is the truth,
[1550.36] but I have seen that she is very 
punctual in offering prayers,
[1559.16] she doesn’t let any prayer 
go unoffered,
[1568.24] I guess that is why God answers 
all her prayers.
[1572.44] Mom, I am telling you
[1574.16] I am constantly having this doubt 
that she is definitely doing something
[1586.80] that is why there is always some 
problem between I and Afnan.
[1600.76] My friend Nida,
[1603.00] the same thing was happening to her,
[1612.16] someone had done 
black magic on her
[1614.36] that is why she and her husband 
always used to fight.
[1623.64] Do one thing,
[1625.00] get this house cleaned properly,
[1628.00] I am sure we will find some amulet.
[1636.00] Yes,
[1638.24] in fact, let me do one thing,
[1639.52] I will get the house cleaned myself 
along with the maid tomorrow.
[1646.36] We will definitely find something.
[1682.52] Aren’t you happy?
[1686.28] Afnan, I thought that you might 
stop being upset
[1690.28] with me after hearing such 
a huge good news
[1694.52] and your heart will melt for me,
[1704.20] but I don’t see your happiness,
[1707.28] are you actually not happy?
[1719.04] At least say something, Afnan.
[1767.60] What do you think
[1769.28] I don’t find out whatever is happening
 in this house?
[1772.16] I know it very well that 
Shani came too,
[1774.12] why did he come?
[1775.32] No, No Afnan, there is nothing like 
that Shani didn’t come here.
[1781.92] Aunt was saying that uncle or 
Shani might come to pick her up,
[1785.76] Shani might have come 
to pick her up,
[1787.68] I didn’t see him, and he didn’t come
 in front of me.
[1790.56] Listen to me very carefully,
[1793.44] I don’t want to see Shani 
in this house now,
[1796.28] else I won’t show any courtesy
[1802.80] I don’t know what games 
are you playing, Ramsha,
[1806.68] I just know that
[1809.72] I am disappointed in my fate today,
[1816.04] I trusted your fake love,
[1821.76] I thought apparently you love me 
but all of it was a lie,
[1825.72] a fraud,
[1830.04] it was just the game of words,
[1833.52] I wish your true face would have
revealed in front of me sooner,
[1839.92] I have made a lot of mistakes.
[1846.60] Why did you go to Afnan?
[1849.88] I am asking you something, 
why did you go to Afnan, Shani?
[1855.36] I went to talk to him to make 
him understand.
[1857.32] you went to make him understand?
[1861.60] Shani, are you out of your mind?
[1863.92] You need to understand first and 
then make someone else understand!
[1867.12] You are the one who needs to 
understand the most in this world.
[1873.28] Ramsha, I cannot see you crying,
[1878.24] you were crying last night,
[1880.04] I felt bad so I felt going and 
talking to Afnan myself
[1884.08] and make him understand
[1885.28] that he should resolve whatever 
misunderstanding there is between you guys.
[1895.40] God’s mercy is very vast 
on His men, Ramsha,
[1906.36] a human being is not so generous.
[1915.36] You must pray
[1917.76] that God melts my heart for you
[1927.12] but there is no place for you 
in my heart right now.
