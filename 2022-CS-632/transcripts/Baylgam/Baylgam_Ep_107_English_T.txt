[16.36] What can we do now Alizeh?
[18.44] What had to happen, 
has already happened,
[20.56] we are all helpless in front of fate.
[25.96] Whenever there is some 
success in my life,
[30.04] Ramsha comes and 
stands next to me,
[44.36] how?
[47.04] How does all this happen?
[49.64] I don’t get it, Mom.
[65.68] I feel this Ramsha is definitely 
doing some black magic,
[75.00] else how is it possible this girl knows 
everything?
[86.48] Mom, I don’t feel good,
[89.16] I don’t understand 
what is happening.
[92.40] Okay, don’t worry you 
else will get unwell.
[96.72] Let me get unwell!
[100.28] I was so happy mom.
[111.20] I wanted to give Afnan 
the happiness of a child,
[121.72] but now he will also have 
a child from Ramsha,
[127.84] this girl has ruined my entire 
happiness.
[130.92] What are you saying, Alizeh?
[132.84] You will be the one who gives 
the first child to Afnan.
[145.56] And you will give the happiness 
of becoming a father to Afnan,
[149.08] why won’t he value you?
[161.72] Umm, the rest, whatever is written 
in fate will happen any how.
[168.60] I am telling you there is definitely
 something wrong,
[182.32] she is definitely doing 
some black magic
[191.84] that is why whatever she wants,
happens.
[195.68] God knows what is the truth,
[198.56] but I have seen that she is very 
punctual in offering prayers,
[207.28] she doesn’t let any prayer 
go unoffered,
[216.40] I guess that is why God answers 
all her prayers.
[220.72] Mom, I am telling you
[222.36] I am constantly having this doubt 
that she is definitely doing something
[234.92] that is why there is always some 
problem between I and Afnan.
[249.00] My friend Nida,
[251.08] the same thing was happening to her,
[260.32] someone had done black magic on her
[262.40] that is why she and her husband 
always used to fight.
[271.92] Do one thing,
[273.28] get this house cleaned properly,
[276.32] I am sure we will find some amulet.
[284.28] Yes,
[286.48] in fact, let me do one thing,
[287.80] I will get the house cleaned myself 
along with the maid tomorrow.
[294.52] We will definitely find something.
[348.20] And I know it very well why you go 
running at your aunt’s house all the time.
[353.96] Afnan,
[356.28] what are you saying?
[362.92] What do you think that I come here 
because of Shani?
[370.60] That is why you have left me here, 
Afnan?
[377.72] I am surprised
[379.96] how can you think like this 
about me, Afnan?
[396.96] Look I don’t know what are the conflicts
between you and Ramsha
[404.96] but she is so worried,
[417.96] she loves you a lot,
[426.76] I have seen her crying 
for you myself.
[438.28] Aren’t you happy?
[442.24] Afnan, I thought that you might 
stop being upset with me
[446.20] after hearing such a huge good news
[450.56] and your heart will melt for me,
[460.08] but I don’t see your happiness.
[465.36] I loved you so much
[469.72] and you.
[475.16] I guess it was the trial of our love,
[480.80] whether you agree or not,
[484.48] the news of your pregnancy has 
brought me a different kind of happiness
[497.16] that I guess I cannot explain 
in words.
[501.76] Now we have to forget all this 
and start a new life.
[601.12] Madam Ramsha?
[604.48] Madam Ramsha?
[606.12] Yes?
[607.44] Madam Ramsha, 
Sir Afnan has given this dress
[610.04] and has asked you to wear it 
and get ready,
[611.24] there is some party that 
you guys need to attend.
[612.80] He just called, he will be here 
in a while.
[616.32] Did he ask me or Alizeh?
[618.32] Do one thing, call Afnan 
and confirm,
[620.72] you might have had some 
misunderstanding.
[622.72] No, he has taken your name 
and given the orders.
[627.24] Okay,
[630.20] I will see.
[640.04] How do I look?
[642.52] You look very nice.
[646.92] Does this color suit me?
[649.52] Yes, it suits you a lot.
[655.64] Actually Afnan, we are going out 
together after so long
[659.32] so I thought of wearing something 
you would like.
[663.76] That is what you have always done,
[666.68] you have always cared about 
what I like and dislike.
[673.84] You are a very good wife.
[685.28] I want Alizeh to be happy till 
the birth of our child.
[701.16] Ramsha, don’t be sad,
[708.04] is it that you have no trust 
in my love?
[716.24] Ramsha, I love you a lot.
[722.88] Trust me when I say this.
[805.76] Why have you kept these 
Wedding pictures with you?
[808.84] Because it is our pictures…
[810.20] So?
[812.96] What do you want?
[815.08] Do you want to use them 
against me as well?
[817.88] You have kept them 
so you can blackmail me,
[820.84] like you got our shopping video viral,
[823.32] you will do the same with Wedding 
pictures too, right?
[825.80] Why would I do that?
[827.12] Because you want the whole world 
to know you are my wife.
[831.12] You got our video viral so people 
can get to know about us,
[835.56] and now you will get these Wedding 
pictures viral
[838.00] so everyone can know 
we are married,
[842.40] but it also had a very straight way, 
you could have asked me once,
[846.32] what was the need to stoop so low, 
Ramsha?
[864.64] only now I have understood you well,
 Ramsha.
[866.68] Only now I have understood 
who you are.
[869.44] I married you, made you 
the honor of my house.
[875.48] I fulfilled the promise I made 
to my dad who was dying
[878.16] and what did you do?
[882.80] You defamed me in the whole society,
[885.52] nothing else.
[888.40] Tell me where did my love fall short
[894.00] that you cheated on me?
[895.80] Afnan, I didn’t cheat you,
[899.68] If I hadn’t promised my dad,
[902.64] I would have taken you and thrown you 
out of my life right here, right now.
[947.28] Afnan, careful, I might hit my foot
somewhere and fall.
[951.04] I won’t let you fall,
[954.56] now slowly, slowly open your eyes.
[957.28] Shall I open them?
[968.68] What is all this Afnan?
[972.48] Afnan?
[975.16] Afnan, where did you go?
[979.20] Afnan?
[982.64] Afnan, where did you go Afnan?
[988.84] Afnan?
[992.92] Afnan?
[1104.76] Afnan?
[1122.32] Afnan?
[1281.96] I am sorry.
[1290.40] I...
[1294.36] I am very guilty.
[1301.92] What happened?
[1304.56] didn’t you like all this?
[1309.48] Enough Afnan,
[1318.08] I am tired,
[1320.44] enough now.
[1329.28] It was very difficult for me 
to control myself,
[1333.36] if I shatter again this time,
[1338.52] it will be very difficult to 
gather myself back.
[1344.16] I am unable to understand 
this changed behavior of yours.
[1357.40] You switch to being so bitter all of 
a sudden from being so soft, I,
[1364.64] I don’t get it.
[1371.12] My heart is not strong enough
[1374.68] to bear your constantly 
changing behavior,
[1385.92] I won’t be able to bear it anymore,
[1389.68] I have become weak from within,
[1393.52] have mercy on me.
[1402.04] I understand what you are saying,
[1406.32] I have made a mistake
[1409.92] that I didn’t believe you
[1421.52] but to be honest,
[1424.80] I am very embarrassed.
[1433.48] I should have believed you,
[1442.72] I should have trusted your character, 
yourself, and everything.
[1457.72] But just give me one last chance,
[1464.64] try to trust me this time,
[1476.24] I won’t break your trust.
[1481.80] Why should I trust you?
[1488.20] Did you trust me?
[1492.52] I am telling you I am embarrassed, 
would you take revenge from me, now?
[1498.44] Yes, I will take revenge.
[1506.48] Why are you smiling now?
[1509.48] When I look at your face,
[1512.48] I get a smile on my face.
[1519.12] You are lying.
[1522.04] No,
[1524.96] I am being absolutely honest.
[1536.12] I am saying I am sorry.
[1539.36] What should I do
[1542.48] I feel like winning your heart 
once again today,
[1549.96] just give me one chance,
[1552.84] please.
[1683.76] Alizeh, you getting worried wouldn’t help,
my love.
[1688.20] Mom, how should I not worry?
[1696.68] Ramsha will give a son to Afnan 
and I will get a daughter,
[1706.68] that way, Ramsha’s value will increase
in front of Afnan.
[1718.68] Ramsha will be called the mom of a son.
[1722.48] What are these superstitious things 
you are talking to me?
[1731.68] Okay, tell me one thing,
[1733.60] has Afnan ever said something 
like this to you,
[1742.28] that I want a son or a daughter?
[1747.16] No, he has never said anything like that.
[1750.52] End of story then,
[1757.28] if Ramsha’s aunt even said 
something like that,
[1759.60] it wouldn’t make any difference.
[1767.80] Whatever God wants, will happen.
[1775.04] Alizeh you should pray that 
God bless you with a healthy baby,
[1780.32] that’s it.
[1790.52] There is no need to worry, 
just relax.
[1806.72] I wanted to give Afnan 
the happiness of a child,
[1810.40] but now he will also have a child 
from Ramsha,
[1816.48] this girl has ruined my 
entire happiness.
[1819.68] What are you saying, Alizeh?
[1821.48] You will be the one who gives 
the first child to Afnan.
[1825.44] I am telling you there is definitely 
something wrong,
[1829.24] she is definitely doing 
some black magic
[1833.48] that is why whatever she wants, 
happens.
[1837.32] God knows what is the truth,
[1840.00] but I have seen that she is very
punctual in offering prayers,
[1844.52] she doesn’t let any prayer 
go unoffered,
[1847.12] I guess that is why God answers 
all her prayers.
