[28.20] Greetings. How are you?
[31.00] Greetings, you here?
[32.96] Why?
[34.20] Can I not come here to meet you?
[36.36] And let me know if you don’t like it, 
I will go back.
[39.36] No, no, aunt there is nothing like that, 
come in, please.
[42.64] Let’s go.
[62.00] What happened Ramsha?
[63.80] You don’t look happy seeing 
Aunt Afsheen here?
[66.56] You look worried since 
you have come here.
[71.24] Yes, I am surprised.
[76.64] Why?
[78.64] Annie, I would be surprised,
[80.64] obviously, I don’t understand
if she has come to meet me,
[83.96] by taking out time from her 
important schedule,
[86.40] here, in this area, in this house.
[94.12] And did you see how happily and 
nicely she was talking to me?
[102.92] I don’t understand what is the secret 
behind this now.
[111.72] I don’t know what will happen now.
[115.40] Okay, come, let’s keep this there.
[117.64] yes, come.
[120.20] Hold this.
[125.16] Come.
[128.48] Sister Afsheen, you didn’t take anything,
have something.
[132.16] Thank you so much, 
I actually had food at home.
[135.92] You came so suddenly,
[137.80] had I known it earlier I would have done
better arrangements.
[142.36] Thank you so much,
[144.16] actually, we wanted to come way before
[150.04] but whatever misunderstandings 
happened between Afnan and Ramsha,
[158.52] to be honest, I didn’t have the courage 
to come here because of that.
[173.00] Ramsha, Alizeh is really 
very embarrassed,
[180.76] you know that misunderstandings are
very normal in relationships.
[191.04] Things get escalated
[193.24] and we are unable to understand.
[201.48] After all, human beings make mistakes.
[205.96] You are absolutely right,
[211.36] realizing your mistake is big itself.
[220.56] If you may allow, 
may I take Ramsha with me?
[231.12] Umm.
[232.76] Brother will be very happy to see her.
[241.16] Umm, I don’t mind but 
if you can ask Shani once.
[246.08] Yes, yes, I will talk to Shani,
[255.28] I hope he won’t say no.
[261.72] Have tea at least.
[292.28] You are not ready yet?
[295.36] Aunt, I cannot come with you.
[299.92] Hmm,
[301.36] that means you haven’t forgiven 
Alizeh yet?
[305.60] There is nothing like that,
[307.92] if Alizeh has apologized from heart 
and her heart is clear for me
[312.92] then I forgive her too.
[316.08] obviously, she has realized her mistake
[319.20] that is why she has sent me to you.
[323.04] Okay,
[324.44] do you know Alizeh was coming herself,
[327.04] but she got a sudden meeting 
so she couldn’t,
[330.28] okay now quickly get ready.
[332.84] Not for us but at least for you uncle,
[336.92] he will be very happy seeing you.
[343.00] Umm,
[344.12] thank you so much, I am waiting.
[353.80] Now that she has come here herself
[357.68] and she has never asked for anything 
ever so I can’t say no.
[363.20] So, then you will come 
to pick me up, right?
[366.32] No, not tomorrow, I have to go to 
Hyderabad for a couple of days,
[370.12] I will call you when my work 
gets done there
[373.32] then I will come to pick you up.
[377.04] Okay.
[401.96] uncle, tea.
[403.48] Stay blessed, what have you 
gotten busy into?
[415.12] Hey, Ramsha, you? 
When did you come?
[422.80] Alizeh and Afsheen went to Ramsha’s place
 and brought her along.
[433.20] Aunt and Alizeh?
[438.72] Yes, I don’t know
[440.32] they were planning for so long, 
I didn’t know about it.
[444.48] Dad, are you well?
[450.72] Yes, son, I am well 
by the grace of God.
[453.28] People talk about such weird things
when they get high temperatures.
[458.48] I am absolutely fine
[460.36] and I am not talking weirdly,
[465.56] you can ask Ramsha.
[477.64] I am unable to believe it,
[480.28] the whole world can change but 
Alizeh can never change.
[489.48] okay, so you guys sit and have tea,
[491.64] I will go change.
[533.60] It is very difficult for me to know
[537.32] what is going on in your heart 
and mind.
[575.32] Ramsha? 
Yes?
[577.64] How are you?
[579.80] I am fine, how are you? 
I am fine too.
[582.72] You didn’t go to office?
[584.52] No, I have taken an off from 
office today,
[587.20] I thought since you are here, 
it’s good,
[589.36] that we chit chat and spend 
sometime together.
[596.72] Did you have breakfast?
[600.28] You must have not,
[601.24] you sit I will send the breakfast 
from inside.
[612.12] What are you looking at?
[616.08] I am noticing that Alizeh has
 changed a lot.
[619.52] Yes, I noticed that her attitude 
has changed a lot towards you.
[624.32] Hmm, looks like Alizeh has 
realized her mistake
[627.52] and that’s huge.
[630.84] I pray that is the case.
[633.64] What do you mean?
[641.40] Afnan? Mistrusting someone is a sin,
[648.44] looks like you haven’t forgiven her 
by heart yet.
[657.80] Look Afnan I want to see you 
and Alizeh happy.
[668.04] Trust me I will be very glad
if both of you are happy.
[796.36] Alizeh?
[799.92] I have brought Ramsha here 
as per your request
[803.56] and you are being so frank with her,
what is the reason?
[811.08] What, what are your intentions?
[830.80] Alizeh,
[832.32] why are you standing quietly here like this?
[834.52] For God’s sake, don’t create 
another drama here.
[840.60] Mom,
[842.44] I will just play the game,
[845.20] the crowd will come themselves.
[848.04] Anyway,
[849.28] I am going to my uncle’s room,
[851.16] Ramsha is there too, 
you must come as well,
[853.36] let’s chat.
[854.76] After all, tell me what are you trying 
to do what is your plan?
[906.48] I have made your favorite coffee 
to fix your mood.
[911.80] Here.
[919.64] Come on, forgive me now.
[929.64] Here.
[931.12] Alizeh?
[933.16] Alizeh, dude.
[987.04] You look upset, tell me a way
to fix your mood.
[998.04] Can I be forgiven now?
[1007.32] Thank God
[1009.36] at least you accepted my apology!
[1014.84] Who told you I accepted the apology?
[1016.60] Really?
[1018.12] But the smile on your face tells 
that you did.
[1024.24] Nice poem by the way.
[1025.60] Really?
[1027.72] Did you google it?
[1031.84] Oh, by the way, I have figured out
[1033.40] that your wife should never have 
so much information about you.
[1036.44] I mean you know I am not interested
in poetry at all
[1039.28] but yes, I google the poem 
and it worked.
[1042.48] I know it
[1044.12] but thank you, they are beautiful.
[1048.04] You’re welcome,
[1049.24] I was just… Dude,
[1051.24] I am getting a very important call, 
one second.
[1052.88] Hmm. 
yes, Mr. Ahmed?
[1062.12] Mom is absolutely right,
[1065.96] if I work less with emotions and 
more using my mind,
[1068.84] everything will happen according 
to my choice,
[1072.68] what do you think, Ramsha,
[1074.76] you will take control of Afnan and 
make him insult me?
[1079.16] And will live happily with her 
own husband?
[1082.16] And I will let you be happy?
[1085.08] Not at all.
[1096.00] Hey what happened? 
Where are you lost?
[1099.36] Nothing,
[1101.44] I was just thinking
[1103.52] how much you love me
[1108.88] and I never understood you.
[1111.36] It’s okay
[1113.16] you have realized it today 
and that’s enough.
[1166.84] Farmhouse?
[1169.04] No, No Alizeh, I cannot go to a farmhouse.
[1175.36] I am already not well and you know it
[1179.52] and Shani just called and said 
that I should rest,
[1183.08] I won’t be able to come.
[1186.08] Ramsha why are you reacting like 
you are unwell.
[1192.96] This is a natural process,
[1195.16] so many women go through it
[1197.28] and they stay normal and 
do all the activities too,
[1199.92] they go out, meet their friends, 
go shopping and look at you,
[1209.12] you are sitting like you are unwell, 
is this the way?
[1212.96] yes, but Alizeh, aunt was telling that
[1215.96] we should be careful at the time 
of first baby.
[1221.32] Listening to you make me feels 
you have a soul from ancient times.
[1233.04] What are you even saying?
[1234.84] It is my friend’s farmhouse, 
we all will enjoy a lot and trust me,
[1238.12] it will be a very good change 
for you too.
[1242.20] No, no Alizeh, I know Shani,
[1244.96] he will never allow me, I cannot go.
[1249.04] Who is asking you to ask Shani?
[1251.80] What do you mean? 
I have to inform him.
[1256.60] Why do you have to tell Shani?
[1259.00] You just told me he has gone
to Hyderabad for two days,
[1269.84] we will go to the farmhouse right now 
and come back,
[1272.96] what is the need to tell him?
[1276.80] No, no Alizeh, I am so sorry,
[1278.88] I cannot lie to Shani.
[1281.16] Hey what’s there to lie about in this?
[1289.68] I am just asking that there is 
no need to tell him anything,
[1300.44] we will just go and come back,
[1305.00] please come along, it will be so much fun.
[1308.60] Look you cannot say no to me.
[1310.84] Alizeh, please don’t force,
[1312.40] I am honestly telling you that 
I don’t feel like going
[1314.80] else I would have definitely 
come with you.
[1319.04] Okay,
[1320.64] it means that you still haven’t forgiven me
[1323.44] that is why you are not coming with me.
[1325.24] There is nothing like that I have forgiven you.
[1330.52] So then immediately get ready,
[1332.04] you are coming with me and 
I don’t want to listen to any excuses.
[1334.60] Quickly get ready, 
I will be right back.
[1336.40] Alizeh?
[1341.88] She is such a stubborn girl, 
what will I tell Shani?
[1345.76] Did you talk to Ramsha?
[1347.92] yes, I did in the morning, she is fine.
[1350.84] Thank God,
[1353.60] she will get to spend some days 
peacefully there.
[1356.80] It’s good she went there
[1359.44] else Shani has really been bothering her,
he gets cranky over everything,
[1363.60] it’s good Afsheen came and 
took her with herself.
[1368.04] Mom, brother is habitual of all this.
[1375.56] Shani’s criticism is not pointless,
[1381.12] Whatever Ramsha has done 
in the past is in front of us.
[1385.08] But mom, that was her past.
[1389.48] You are right, it was her past,
[1393.24] but a husband never forgets 
his wife’s bad past
[1398.36] that is why they say that girls should 
keep their character so pure
[1403.72] that no matter what angle 
do you look at it from,
[1406.52] there is not a single stain 
that can be seen.
[1409.16] Girls these days,
[1411.12] they are uploading pictures on 
social media, on their status,
[1415.56] they don’t know this at all
[1417.44] that how they themselves are buying 
destruction for their marital life.
[1422.40] They don’t realize this and 
their parents doesn’t either,
[1426.32] we thank God that those things never
existed in our times
[1430.00] and that why the situation of our lives 
are better today,
[1434.44] we have been peacefully married
and sitting in our home
[1439.36] else these daily fights, doubts,
[1443.40] fight and divorces happen 
immediately after marriage,
[1446.48] marriages happen again and again,
so does divorces.
[1448.36] Obviously, wife loses interest 
in her husband
[1452.60] and the husbands doubt their wives.
[1457.44] I guess Mom is right.
[1461.04] Okay go call Shani from your phone,
[1466.00] I have called him a couple of times, 
he is not attending.
[1469.16] Oh, okay, okay I will get my phone.
[1484.24] What should I do?
[1486.76] No, no Alizeh, I am so sorry,
[1488.80] I cannot lie to Shani.
[1491.24] Hey what’s there to lie about in this?
[1493.92] I am just asking that there is 
no need to tell him anything,
[1498.60] we will just go and come back 
and he wouldn’t even know.
[1502.60] No, no,
[1503.84] I should tell Shani before there is a problem,
he must know at least.
[1519.52] Ramsha?
[1522.84] What happened? 
Who are you calling?
[1524.32] Actually Alizeh, 
I was calling Shani.
[1531.96] I want to inform him before leaving 
so at least he knows where I am.
[1539.80] Actually, you don’t know him 
he has a very short temper.
[1547.44] If I go without informing him
[1549.28] and he finds out he will get very angry 
and mad at me
[1557.76] that is why I am calling him.
[1576.20] What happened
[1578.48] He is not attending the call.
[1581.16] Let me do one thing,
[1583.52] uncle and mom are downstairs 
let me tell them,
[1588.08] if Shani will call, they will tell him
[1590.48] that you are with me, okay?
[1595.28] Look, we are getting very late now 
you quickly get ready, leave this phone.
[1599.04] Go get ready I will go change too.
[1618.60] Brother tea. 
Thank you.
[1621.12] Afsheen, where is Ramsha, 
I don’t see her.
[1624.12] Brother she has gone to a 
farmhouse with Alizeh.
[1629.04] Farmhouse?
[1631.88] Yes,
[1632.96] actually, a few of Alizeh’s friends 
arranged a get-together there
[1637.28] so Alizeh thought of taking 
Ramsha along too.
[1640.36] She has gone with so much 
interest with Alizeh.
[1646.08] And you know Ramsha doesn’t get
a chance to go to such places.
[1651.96] do one thing, bring my phone 
I will talk to Ramsha. Go.
[1658.36] No, no brother,
[1660.24] there is no point in calling there,
[1663.40] Alizeh was saying there are 
no signals at the farmhouse.
[1669.60] Why are you worried, 
they will both come soon.
[1923.76] Afsheen?
[1925.32] You said they will come early,
[1927.04] did you see the time? 
Where are they?
[1929.28] Brother, that is what Alizeh told me.
[1931.76] So call and ask them,
[1933.16] how much time will it take 
for them to come back.
[1934.80] Brother, I told you there are 
network issue there
[1938.12] but I am still trying to contact 
but it is not going through.
[1940.48] What is the need to go to such places
where there are such problems,
[1943.40] and we are the ones worried, 
look at what time it is.
[1948.72] Both are girls and we don’t know 
where they are.
[1953.04] Alizeh is calling. 
Attend it.
[1955.56] Hello Alizeh, where are you guys
[1958.64] it has been so long since
I have been trying to call you.
[1962.20] What?
[1967.36] Hospital?
[1968.84] Hospital?
[1970.48] Which hospital?
[1974.20] Okay, fine. Okay.
[1978.32] What happened Afsheen, tell me?
[1980.68] Brother actually, Ramsha…
[1982.88] What Ramsha?
[1984.68] Brother Ramsha has fallen. 
She is in the hospital.
[1990.80] Ramsha fell, hospital?
[1994.12] Oh my God.
[2022.24] Where? Where is Ramsha? 
How is she?
[2024.68] Uncle she is inside, 
doctor is checking her.
[2028.52] How did she fell in to the swimming pool
[2031.04] and where were you at that time?
[2032.56] I don’t understand why did you take her?
[2035.96] Uncle I didn’t know this will happen.
[2038.36] She just fell into the swimming pool,
[2040.00] doctor is checking her they will let us know.
[2041.92] Oh God, keep things well. Where is she?
[2044.64] In that room.
[2049.84] Where is Ramsha?
[2051.44] Where is Ramsha? Is she okay?
[2054.72] Why don’t you answer me? 
Where is Ramsha? Is she fine?
[2058.68] Afnan, she has lost her baby
in this accident.
[2078.60] Are you mad?
[2080.56] Have you lost your mind? What?
What are you saying?
[2083.68] What have you done?
[2085.88] When you couldn't take care of her
why did you take her with you?
[2089.56] Afnan, what did I know that 
this will happen?
[2092.20] You didn’t know?
[2093.96] You didn’t know her condition?
She needed extreme care.
[2098.64] So Afnan I just took her that 
I will be a change for her,
[2102.24] my good deed got me into trouble.
[2103.84] Good deed?
[2105.60] What is this good deed that 
put someone else in a trial?
[2109.76] You should be ashamed,
[2111.92] whatever happened with her today, 
you are responsible for it.
[2114.04] Lower your tone when you talk to me. 
Why? Why should I talk in a lower tone?
[2117.48] Have you seen your behavior?
[2121.04] For now, call any of her relatives if you 
have their number and ask them to come here.
[2125.28] Call, call that Shani
[2127.96] and inform him so he can come 
to the hospital.
[2130.40] Okay, okay, don’t tell me what to do.
[2160.24] Have patience, Ramsha. Daughter,
[2163.32] that was God’s will
[2165.24] why do you blame yourself and 
hurt yourself more?
[2168.92] Be patient, my child, be patient.
[2171.48] No uncle I am unable to have patience.
[2179.76] I am unable to have patience,
it’s a huge accident,
[2183.92] I am unable to be patient.
[2187.96] Oh God, help me. 
I am unable to be patient.
[2192.60] God, please give me patience.
[2194.96] Look, your aunt is also here, yeah?
[2198.28] I am unable to have patience. 
My child, look your aunt.
[2203.44] Aunt?
[2206.36] Aunt? I have lost my baby.
[2217.60] See, see what kind of a mother I am 
I couldn’t take care of my baby, aunt.
[2225.32] I am even unable to have patience.
[2230.68] Aunt, I am unable to have patience. 
My baby.
[2237.84] I am unable to have patience.
[2241.40] God has put me through 
this difficult test.
[2246.24] Oh God, give me patience.
