Alizey, how was your meeting? Uncle, it went very good, I got way more appreciation 
than I expected. Mom, my boss is so proud of me. Do you remember Mr Ashar? He even wants to come 
and meet you all. I told him about you all 
so he wants to come home. So then, my child, call him 
for dinner some day. Hey? No no dad, what is wrong with you? Why would we call any stranger 
at our home like this? Why? If he wants to come, let him, and guests are a source of blessing 
anyway. Brother, the family is very good, I have met his mother at 
Alizey’s promotion party. She is a very nice lady. Really aunt? By the way, aunt I guess you don’t know, the world has gotten very clever, people seem to be different than 
they actually are. Who is what, only God knows all that,
brother. We have no idea, 
we judge by what we see but we should always think positive 
and keep good hopes. A Muslim should have good hopes in 
another Muslim, that’s what we are ordered. Dad, you are absolutely right but you are talking with your
 own point of view, you don’t see bad in anyone at all, that is why people take advantage
from you. You are night Afnan, your late uncle would say the same. He used to say that brother has a very soft heart and due to this softness everyone
takes advantage of him. Afsheen, everything will be left here, we won’t take anything with us, only our deeds will accompany us. And we are ordered to be kind. Kindness develops fear of God in you, it brings you closer to God. Hmm, uncle you are absolutely right,
 I am with you. Stay blessed. You will go to meet Afnan? What if everyone finds out at home? And if brother finds out, there will be a lot of drama. You think I am a fool like you? That I will inform family before 
going anywhere or any of my plan? Am I a fool? I won’t tell anything to anyone so no one would know anything. I have decided that I am going 
to meet Afnan tomorrow and no one will know anything. Speak slowly, you are not afraid of anyone. What if someone sees you with Afnan? Are you insane? No one will see why are you 
talking like that? And you know where Afnan has 
asked me to meet him, our family cannot even think of going there, let alone going there. Now Afnan won’t come to any ordinary place, he has called me to meet him 
at a 5 star restaurant, Ramsha, he seems like a guy who would manipulate girls by talking 
rich and then blackmails them Annie, you are so negative, he is not like that, he is very nice. I have spoken to him 
on call for hours and after talking to him 
I just feel like meeting him, I feel like seeing him, I just keep on listening to him 
and he sit in front of me. And by the way, I have decided that I am going to go meet Afnan 
tomorrow, means I will! What will you tell aunt? What would I say? I will say anything, infact, it’s Sania’s birthday tomorrow, remember she told me? So what I will do is I will tell mom 
that I am going to Sania’s birthday. This would be the best excuse. Do you remember Mr Ashar? He even wants to come 
and meet you all. I told him about you all 
so he wants to come home. Brother, the family is very good, I met his mother at 
Alizey’s promotion party. She is a very nice lady. I expected Afnan to be here 
before me and would be waiting for me. But this guy is very different 
from other boys. Usually boys wait for girls here, and he is making me wait? I am sure he wants to set 
an impression on me. Is there a possibility that 
Afnan made me a fool? I shouldn’t have come here at all. Annie was right, what should I do I made a mistake 
by coming here. I shouldn’t have come here at all. Ramsha. Afnan. Sit down. Umm hand. Sorry.
Please. Where has she been, I even asked her to come soon. Oh God! I hope we don’t get into trouble. Why isn’t she scared? 
I am not getting a good vibe. From here. Hey hey, what is this road that 
you are taking from? Umm, we are going towards 
the Clifton road. No why Clifton road? Hey, your house is there, that is why. Oh I am so sorry. I forgot. What? What did you forget? Actually I mean I don’t take this road 
to go home usually, I go from this other road, 
I rarely come here. Okay. 
That is why. I see. 
Yes. Umm, Ramsha, by the way I have observed 
one thing. Yes? You used to talk so much on call but now that we are face to face, you have stopped talking at all. 
Are you okay? no there is nothing like that. Actually, may I tell you something? You speak so nicely, 
and in such a lovely way, I just feel like listening to you 
while you keep talking. That’s so sweet of you. Umm, may I take in from here then? No, no, do one thing just drop me here
 at the left side, I will go by myself from here, 
it’s just a 2-minute walk from here. Hey what are you saying? 
I can’t do that. I will drop you home. No I will manage from here, 
you just carry on with your work, you will be bothered so that’s why
I was asking you to drop me here. Are you sure? Okay fine. 
Thank you. umm. You take care. 
You too. Bye. 
Bye. Bye. I even asked her not to go 
but this girl never listens to me. Annieee What? 
Annie? Annie, I am very happy. What happened? Annie, I have fallen in love, I have fallen in love with Afnan 
at first sight. He is so nice, so nice, so nice
that I can’t even tell you. When I saw him he looked 
so handsome, he looked so good looking, he was dressed so well that 
I cannot even tell you. What is going on? What is going on? Nothing brother, 
nothing is going on. I ironed your clothes and 
keep them inside. Annie, Annie, he looked so nice, I feels like I have fallen in love 
at first sight, infact I am getting crazy in love with him. 
He looked so nice. If brother hears you, 
we will get in trouble. What is wring with you? You are being scared like you were out 
to meet Afnan instead of me. Sshhh Ramsha, we will both get in trouble.
 Let’s go inside. He looked so nice, 
his dressing was so good. Quiet! We will get in trouble. Where is he lost? 
Why hasn’t he come back yet? He must be here anytime. Okay so tell me how is your work? Umm, office is going really well, 
by the grace of God. Hmm. he has been managing it pretty well. here he is. So? How are you? 
How is life? I am fine, brother, 
where were you lost? I went to meet a friend. Which friend? You don’t know him. Which friend is it that I don’t know? there are a lot of such friends but he came for a business meeting 
to meet me, you weren’t in the office at that time. They insisted a lot on having 
lunch with them, so I said okay, I will get some details 
from them there. Anyway, you tell me? 
what is your scene umm… Ramsha? Ummm… 
Oh God. Mom, I was just going to change, 
I was almost done with the video. do you know I have been going
crazy trying to find this dress and to hell with your video. Your craze is really bothering me now, I just pray to God that you don’t get 
a single like on this video. Oh God! What are you saying? I have gotten ready and 
you are telling me that I don’t get like on the video? Don’t say that mom, 
take your curse back. Who did you ask before 
wearing this dress? If it would have gotten 
even a little stained, Tabassum would have been so mad. And if she finds out that 
you have worn it, that will be the end. Who will tell her? Who will tell her? No one right? And you don’t worry 
so much, she won’t find out, I have just worn it
 for 10 minutes, the dress didn’t get worn out or anything. I am just making one more TikTok 
then I will go and change. You dare not. You dare not and don’t you even dare look at the dresses
 that come to me for stitching purposes. When do you listen to me? your mind is 24 hours occupied 
in these videos. I am just making one video
and leaving then. Enough I am going. Oh God. Afnan?
Hmm? Ashar’s family wants to come 
and meet tomorrow. Why? Ashar has proposed me What? Ashar has proposed you and 
you are telling me now? So? He has proposed me today only and you are the first person I am telling it
 to I haven’t told anyone yet. By the way, I have figured out that 
this Ashar is a complete jerk. Why? Why would you say that? Are you jealous? What? I? am jealous of Ashar. Why? Because he has proposed to me. So he hasn’t accomplished something 
huge by proposing you that I had to do. By the way, tell me one thing, why do you think that 
I would be jealous of Ashar? I was just asking you. No but still, you must be feeling something about it
because of which I am jealous. Afnan, there is nothing Hey?
It’s just random. Hey Alizey, tell me? 
I want to listen. Ramsha. Afnan. Ramsha. What video are you making?
 What are you doing? Where is the ohone? 
Do you see my phone anywhere? No right? So how will I make any video? You are strange, mom, 
you have ruined my whole mood. So then what were you doing, 
after all? Nothing, I was just … Umm mom come here, come sit here. 
Here. Come and sit here. 
Oh God. tell me something, did you and Dad had a love marriage? What nonsense? Does any girl ask such questions 
to their mother? Aren't you ashamed? tell me, it’s fine. Tell me? Tell me, tell me. My parents had chosen your dad for me. I didn’t even see him before marriage. Oh boy! Had you seen him before marriage, 
you wouldn’t have to see this day today. Ramsha. I mean, mom, every girl wishes to get 
a good looking handsome man, now no one likes a man 
with a big belly. Look at dad. Your dad wasn’t always like this and he never had a big belly. Your dad was very handsome 
before marriage. Hmm, handsome yeah? Tell me more, how was dad? Tell me. Enough enough, stop talking nonsense, go and make nice tea for me. And don’t make a lot of mess in the kitchen, 
Annie has just cleaned it. Alizey? Did Afnan say anything? What will he say mom? you guys are such good friends, you have known each other 
since childhood and you have such good understanding. Even brother loves you so much. Alizey, I feel that Afnan likes you. Mom there is nothing like 
what you are thinking. You are just self assuming all of this. Alizey, there is no harm if all of this happens. Look my child, after your dad’s death, brother just didn’t give us support 
but he also gave us the best life. And he never let you be 
deprive of anything, nothing else will make me happier than 
you being married to Afnan. You will stay in front of my eyes 
in this house. Mom, this is your thinking and wish. Just mine? Why don’t you be vocal about 
what you think and what is your wish. Why don’t you make him realize 
that you like him? Why? When after hearing about my proposal, it didn’t make any difference to him 
then why should I say anything? Mom, even I have some self respect. Ashar’s family is coming tomorrow. 
You must meet them. Best. Annie, keep your expressions 
on point on my lines. You will say your lines after mine.
 Okay? Put on the mobile. 
Give me the mobile. Put it, quickly put it and yes Annie, when I am saying my lines just keep 
your espressions on point, your feelings should be shown properly. 
Understand? I really have to explain it to you. If you spoil the video then… I understood, I understood, 
I used to make mistakes before, you keep on taunting me for that daily. Making a mistake is different but how you laugh while the video 
is being made, I feel like… Ummm Ramsha, did you hear? It’s mom’s voce, right? That’s a false alarm, don’t you know your mom, she takes hours when she goes 
to the market. But if she sees me making the TikTok,
she won’t spare me, Actually mom doesn’t like me 
making TikToks at all. Actually mom doesn’t like me 
making TikToks at all. Will you waste all the time talking or 
shall we even start making the video? Make the video properly Annie, 
if you ruin my video… go out and stand there you have to 
enter in the frame at 3 2 1 okay? Come on, ready? 3 2 1… Annie? Get lost. You ruined 
the whole video again. I didn’t. Mom did. Did you see? 
Mom is calling. Annie, where are you lost?
 Annie? No, no, no, Annie, let’s complete 
this video and then go after that, not right now, okay? 
Mom is calling. Annie? 
No Ramsha, mom will scold me a lot. 
Please leave my hand. Get lost. How will I make videos. How ill I get the likes. I have a lousy partner. I got dressed and all. Annie!! It’s okay I will make it alone. It’s fine. Anie, I am surprised, you looked so bad in braid as well even then that bald man like you? By the way the way that 
bald guy was staring at you, I had doubts that you won’t get rid of that bald man 
that easily. Please Ramsha, don’t call him bald 
again and again, his name is Salim. Oh ho! His name is Salim, by the way when you hear that name,
it feel like some uncle would be walking in, infact, it feels like a milkman. Are you my friend or enemy, instead of comforting me 
you are contantly taunting. My love, we comfort the widows and you aren’t even married 
to the bald guy yet. Mom, I don’t want to marry him, 
please refuse them. What? Why are you both looking at me?
 I haven’t said anything to her. I am telling you to refuse them, 
I don’t want to marry him. What nonsense? He is a good educated guy, 
he is a doctor, you don’t get such educated 
proposals all the time. Right, he has studied so much that his hair… I know that you are the one who taught her 
and brainwashed her. No aunt, I was making her understand that please annie he is so educated
you must marry him. Right? Ramsha, you go and 
wash the dishes, come on. That is how you can shut up,
go away. What did I…
Go. I am going. Mom, I don’t want to marry him, I will kill myself but 
I won’t marry him, please tell them it’s a no. She has done all this. Brother, I have asked Aliza to give 
them our message to have dinner with us, they are new people, you know 
it is a daughter’s matter, I am a little nervous. Why are you nervous, Afsheen? Alizey is not your but my responsibility, let them come, we will talk and then decide what to do. brother, just pray a lot for my daughter, you all are always in my prayers. Greetings. 
Greetings. Greetings. 
Come, sit Afnan No aunt I am not hungry at all. What happened? Yes dad I have a lot fo work at office 
so that is why I will eat there. Bye. Bye. Brother, I will be back from the kitchen, these servants do not listen 
unless I scold them Easy, they have some rights too. Greetings. Yes, Mr Imam. Yes I asked you to call all the 
committee members of the mosque, we will see then and decide. Yes. If God wills. Yes. In God’s hands. Let me call Afnan. What is it? Why don’t you pick up? I haven’t spoken to him since yesterday,
he is not picking up. I don’t know he might be worried. Let me try again. He might pick up now. How do I look? Horrible. Have you eaten something bitter? Okay did you meet Ashar’s family? I didn’t and I don’t even want to, in fact ask them to get lost right now. Afnan, how are you talking? Anyway, don’t meet if you don’t want to, 
I am going. They are waiting for me for so long. You won’t go anywhere. You won’t leave this room. Afnan, leave my hand. I won’t leave your hand. Only I will leave this room right now, I will go out and ask aunt 
to ask them to leave else, or else I will have to say this to them. Afnan, wait. Afnan wait. Afnan, listen to me, 
why are you misbehaving? They are our guests, Mom has invited them for dinner, what are you going to do? Look we cannot ask them 
to leave like this. okay, you and Aunt cannot so don’t do it 
but I can and I am going to say No to them Afnan, what is this madness? What is wrong with you? 
What is this behavior? Look, I understand you are helpless 
and aunt too but right now you just have two choices, either you go yourself and 
ask them to leave else I will go and tell them to leave. Okay, I understand, you can’t so I am going, I will go and refuse them 
but don’t complain to me later. Afnan, wait, why don’t you understand 
their family is sitting downstairs, why do you want to embarrass me 
in front of everyone, he has come here with his family 
what is wrong with you? Why are you doing all this? Because I love you Alizey. You expressed your love very soon. But nothing can be done now, it’s too late. What the hell? My mind is already fed up 
from all the house chores and then Mr Afnan is not taking my call. Ramsha, make tea for me. Why? Annie just made it, 
you should have had it yes but I wasn’t home 
so I didn’t have it. So make it. So it’s not my fault. Go and ask Annie she will make it for you. I don’t understand why do you refuse
 to do every work of mine? Because I am not your servant 
or your wife, that’s why. Why are you looking at me like this?
 I am right, I am not your wife that 
I should obey to your orders. Give me tea. Oh God! Ramsha? Think before talking, 
you just say whatever you feel like. Why is your mood off? 
You didn’t talk to Afnan? No I didn’t. he doesn’t take my call 
whenever I call him. By the way its great that you came, go make tea for Shani, 
he is dying to have tea, before he complaints to dad about me. Please now don’t start fighting
 with my brother. I will go make tea 
you have sorbet meanwhile. Yes, give it to me. Aunt food was amazing. There is a lot of taste in your hands. Thank you so much. By the way, I don’t cook at home but when special guests come over 
I cook for them. No thank you so much. You guys gave us so much 
respect and love, I feel my son is not becoming a son-in-law
 but a son of this house. Son-in-law is a son too. Come Afnan, what happened, you didn’t even come 
for dinner today? Was there a lot of work in office? Yes I didn’t come because you know it very well that 
I am very busy. This is Afnan my nephew. Afnan this is Ashar you must know him;
these are his parents. Come sit and have tea with us. Son, come sit and have tea. Yes, dad just a minute. You guys had dinner, right? Yes, son, we did. Very good. So, what are you guys still doing here? You guys must have been on 
your way home by now. No? hey? You guys got worried. Don’t be so worried, come let me remove all your worries. The purpose you guys are here for, I won’t let that happen 
at least till I am here. So then don’t waste your 
and our time by sitting. Afnan? 
hey? Please? Did I say something wrong? 
Okay let's do one thing, Alizey didn’t like what I said but Alizey will say this in her own words, then you guys will understand, right? And if you don’t then listen again, just get out of my house right now.
