How can he divorce her like this? If there was some fight 
between husband and wife, if there was an unpleasant argument, they should have at least 
involved their parents and consulted their elders 
for better decisions. Shani divorced her suddenly, I didn’t get it. Ramsha, why didn’t you tell me
 all this earlier? Had you told me all this earlier, I would have ripped the face 
of Danish Kamal. These are the morons who take advantage of 
the naivety of girls and use them for their purpose and our poor girls cannot even say
 anything to anyone due to their honor and that is what the morons 
take advantage of. Ramsha, you should have trusted me, 
you should have told me, I would have spoken to Shani, made him understand, at least all this wouldn’t have happened, 
whatever has happened. I got so scared, Aunt, I didn’t understand what to do. He took advantage of this fear, but it is not your fault, it is our fault too. We parents, we give full freedom 
to our children first, don’t restrict them from anything and when they get into some trouble due 
to this freedom, then we don’t trust them, we don’t trust anything they say. I remember, mom and dad repetitively told me 
to step back, and fix yourself but, but I didn’t listen to them at all, it is just because of that 
I am facing all this, I wish I would have listened 
to them, Aunt, this regret wouldn’t have been 
in my fate today. Let me go check, mom. Yes but if your face remains ashen and stress-laden like this then everyone
will doubt that something is wrong. They might even find out. So please, relax yourself. We got out of a problem 
like this before. We can get out of it again. You have 20 minutes. In 20 minutes, I will drop you 
at your house. Try to get into your normal zone 
by that time. Okay? Here son, have tea. I have served the tea for Afsheen 
in Ramsha’s room. Shani is not home? Shani has his flight to Dubai 
this morning so he left, son. I was thinking that had Ramsha 
told this to me earlier, I would have not let things get this far. May such people rot in hell, these people like Danish Kamal,
 they have destroyed our kids. Now look, our Ramsha got the label of being 
divorced at such a young age, I am so worried of thinking 
about her future that what will happen next? Aunt, where will Ramsha spend her days
of waiting period? My child, you don’t worry for Ramsha at all, Ramsha will spend her waiting period
 here with me, now even Shani is not here, 
he has gone to Dubai. Ramsha is a very patient girl, I am sure God will reward her 
for her patience. If God wills. Have tea, son. okay Aunt, please call Aunt, I need to go for an important work. Okay. Oh my Lord, I have never complained to you ever, never, whatever you have done 
so far I agree to it, I am sure there is an expedience 
in everything you do but my heart, my heart is not at peace, I feel like my heart will stop, Oh Lord, I just see darkness everywhere, I have been very lonely, I have nothing left, 
everything is over, oh my Lord, help me. Oh my Lord, never leave me, you always stay with me. Oh my Lord, you just be enough for me, help me, give me peace, support me, give peace to my heart, give peace to my heart. Umm I killed him. I have murdered him, Afnan. Killed who? Relax and tell me, 
please? He was dying in front of my eyes.
I have killed him, he is dead, I have killed him. 
He is dead. Ramsha, Ramsha, Relax, relax, 
you come here, sit here. If police find out it will be 
a huge problem, they will tell my family. Nothing will happen, who did you murder? 
How did all this happen? I was thinking that had Ramsha 
told this to me earlier, I would have not let things get this far. May such people rot in hell, these people like Danish Kamal, 
they have destroyed our kids. Now look, our Ramsha got the label 
of being divorced at such a young age, I am so worried of thinking 
about her future that what will happen next? What are you trying to say? Divorce Shani and marry me. How can you even think that? You think I am that shallow, Afnan? That is not what I mean. You should have at least let some 
respect be there in my eyes, I am not as shallow as you think of me. Just let it be, I will go by the auto. Afnan, I was thinking that when brother comes back, how would I tell him about 
Ramsha’s divorce, because he is already not well, it will be very traumatic for him. Mom, what else can we do? I mean, see I never get that girl, she made her videos first, got them viral and then she eloped, she got married, got divorced, and she already got married after 
so much difficulty now this divorce, what can we do? Aren’t you ashamed? You think Ramsha must have taken 
divorce Shani by her own choice? She got her video viral 
by her own choice? Alizeh, you are a woman yourself and despite being a woman you cannot 
understand another woman’s pain? Do you have any idea she has been 
through so much pain during this time? So she is responsible for it 
herself, Afnan. If she got married to Shani, she should have compromised 
and lived with him. And anyway, Shani has accepted her
even after so much has happened, else who marries such girls? What happened? Why are you 
looking at me like this? You rejected her as well. Yes, I guess that was the biggest mistake 
of my life. Did you see him? How fearlessly he has confessed 
his love in front of both of us. He doesn’t care at all that
even you are sitting here and then you tell me 
I am behaving rudely. Doesn’t he have manners? Alizeh, stay quiet for a while, you have given him a chance 
to say all this. Hmm, that is what I was thinking for so long, how come you are 
not saying anything to me? Because you just see 
my fault in everything, you don’t see any fault of his, 
whatever he is doing. You don’t care about me at all, no one cares about me 
in this house. Anwar, shall I serve food? Hmm? What happened? Who were you talking on call with? Your child called from Dubai. Okay, what was he saying? He is coming back. So soon? But he had no plans of coming 
very soon. Your son is destroyed. He has suffered loss in the business. Oh god, I hope everything is well. Now, what will happen, now? Now you have to decide will you keep your son in this house
or Ramsha? Listen? Go and tell Ramsha to make 
arrangements for herself elsewhere. My child, your waiting period 
is also over and Shani is coming back too, I kept you in this house until 
Shani wasn’t here but I cannot keep you here 
while Shani is present here, you try to understand that 
I am helpless. What are you saying, Mom? Where will she go? Ramsha, my child, you must go to brother Qasim’s house. He still loves you like 
before and I think there is no safer place for you 
in this world than his house. No Aunt, I won’t go to his house, I don’t want to go there again 
and be a burden on him. He has done a lot of favors on me,
he is my guardian and one must not bother 
their guardians. My child, Shani is coming tomorrow and 
your uncle asked me to tell you to make arrangements 
for yourself before Shani comes back. How can you ask her to leave, Mom? This is cruel. Annie, I am as helpless as 
you are right now. I tried to convince your dad 
as much as I could but now, it is not in my control 
to convince him. I don’t know what has happened 
to Mom and Dad, if brother is coming back, 
does it mean you will leave? What is this behavior? 
Where will you go? what you have seen is 
not the complete truth. If you just listen to me once, 
I will explain everything. What I have seen and heard 
is not the complete truth? Then what is the truth? What is the truth that I will hear today,
 and my heart will find ease? We provided refuge to you. Kept you in our house, 
I always defended you. I treated you like my own daughter and this how you repaid me?
Believe me, had my daughter done something 
similar I would have killed her. You have ended everything. You have ruined everything, the beautiful relationship 
between me and you, the peace of this house, the trust of my mother, and our respect. Everything. Everyone is blaming me without letting me explain myself. No one heard me. Someone should have asked me 
once what happened. What was my helplessness that
I resorted to this step? What was this helplessness Ramsha that took you Danish Kamal’s 
bedroom? Your mom died and 
went six feet under, and you have sent me to the grave
while I am still alive. Ramsha, I will not tolerate you 
for a single second in my life and I… Shani, Listen to … Ramsha, I divorce you. I divorce you. I divorce you!! My child, Shani is coming tomorrow and 
your uncle asked me to tell you to make arrangements for yourself 
before Shani comes back. How can you ask her to leave, Mom? This is cruel. Annie, I am as helpless as you are right now. I tried to convince your dad 
as much as I could but now, it is not in my control to convince him. I didn’t know what to do, I suddenly thought about you 
so I called you immediately. Look, I just want that you keep me 
with you in your flat, I will do some job and 
earn money through that and pay half of the rent of your flat and I will take care of all the expenses
equally with you, I just need home. What are you saying, Ramsha? A friend in need is a friend indeed, and when I was new in this city, 
your dad helped me in every way. Yes, Dad was very nice, he used to help everyone. True that, and who helps anyone without 
any reason nowadays? You can come to my home 
without any worries, I leave for job around 12, 
come before that. Okay thank you. Bye. Are you leaving? Yes, obviously, this is not my parents’ home anymore
that I can stay here. People are so right when they say that parent’s home 
is only until parents are alive and now this is not even 
my in-law’s house anymore, so I will have to leave, how long can I stay at 
any relatives’ house for? Ramsha… Don’t worry, I know, no matter if I live in this house or not, I will always stay in your heart for sure. I thought that we would always live 
together after you married my brother, I didn’t know all this would happen.
