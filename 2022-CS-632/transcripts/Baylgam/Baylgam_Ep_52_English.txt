Come in. Greetings uncle. Greetings. You had called me? Yes, child, I didn’t get a chance to talk to you
 in the wedding preparation. You tell me, are you happy? Ramsha, I am asking 
you something, child. Tell me. Are you happy? 
Is everything okay? Yes, uncle. Look child, nothing will be 
done against your will, and no one will force
 you for anything. Not even me. You tell me, what does your heart say? What is your will? You are happy, right? Yes, uncle, nowadays,
 I really miss, mama. So I felt like crying. Daughters miss their 
mother in such situations. God bless, if sister Mehnaz was alive, she would have taken 
care of all the matters. Pray for her forgiveness. In fact, I would say that you increase
 your good deeds. Your parents will get blessed for 
every single good deed you go. Good children are continuous
 charity for the parents. Yes, you are right uncle. Stay happy. One minute. One minute. I wanted that you make some preparations 
by your choice for the wedding. No, uncle. I cannot take this. You have done me so many favors, I don’t need anything else. Child, who said that I am doing a favor on you? You know, I really wished, in fact, I prayed to God that if He blesses me with a daughter, I will do all this. So, think that doing all this, I am fulfilling my wish. And this is not from an
 uncle for her niece, think that this is a present from your 
father for his daughter. I hope you will not say no. I cannot even repay the favor of 
your love on me, even if I want to. Fathers don’t do
 favors on daughters, child. They love them. They pray for their good fate. Just live long, always stay happy. Yes, uncle. When will you get ready? It is time for the guests to come. Mama, I don’t understand why uncle is spending so 
much on this girl’s wedding? I mean, what is the 
need for this function? He spent on the jewellery, 
he spent on the dowry, and now this useless expense? He should have married
 her with simplicity. This was the insistence 
of Ramsha’s in-laws. They had said they 
would do all the functions. You know, brother was even against the Mayun. Leave it mama, if it was in uncle’s control, he would give half his
 wealth in her dowry. If you and I will say something, then brother would mind it. So it is better that you just get ready. Sorry mama, neither will I get ready, nor will I be part 
of these functions. When they were 
spending so much, then they should have 
a function in a good hall. What was the need to invite 
them at home? The entire family go 
around in the home freely. Hey, listen to me. Even if for ten minutes, but you will have to come. You know brother, he will get upset. Mama, you cannot pressurize me. My love, I am not pressurizing you. I am just telling you that at times a person has to go against their will. Understand this, please. Get ready quickly and come. I am waiting. May God protect you 
from the evil eye. Here, remove the evil eye of your 
son with five hundred. Afnan, where are you going? I have to talk to Ramsha. What do you want to talk about? I will tell you. I just want to
 talk for two minutes. Listen to me, leave her. All her relatives are there, what do you have to do there? You concentrate on me, leave her. Tell me, how do I look? You look really good. Really good. You like such clothes, so I got this dress made. We will get rid of her soon. Anyway, do you want something? You should have stayed a little longer. My child, you know Annie is not well, she is alone at home. After all, I have to do a lot
 for the function tomorrow. You know I have to do it alone. It is just a matter of some time. Once I come, I will get all the work done with you. Oh my child. You are coming as my daughter in law, that is enough for me. I don’t have to make you work. The car is here. Okay child, let’s go. Bye. Bye. Come on, let’s go. Okay, we will go. Mama. Papa. Yes? You people go sit in the car, I will just come. I feel I left my mobile inside. You know nothing about this boy. Ramsha. I made an excuse to mama and came, that I left my mobile here. You still haven’t left, Shani? What are you doing, Shani? Someone will see us. Hey, why are you doing this? You are acting like I am a stranger. We will get married tomorrow. We are going to get married Shani, we are not married yet. You leave from here. Hey, why are you showing
 useless tantrums? These tantrums of yours… I had come here to talk
 to you about love, and you are showing 
me tantrums. I had thought you had 
mended your ways. You have not changed
 even a little. If you make me understand 
something with love, then I will understand a thousand
 things from you, not just one. Stay in your limits Shani. Don’t you understand it once? Go from here. Everyone will see. Leave. Why are you acting so pure? Huh? Have you forgotten your past? I knew it. I knew that you are a lowlife. Yes, I am a lowlife. You recognized me well. And after marriage, you will understand that 
I am not just a lowlife, in fact, I am cheap too. Because I remember everything, and I will take my revenge
 for everything. What did they used to call you? Shopping girl. What happened?
 Do you want something? Me? You. Have you gone mad? Are you in your senses? What did you say? You know I realized
 something today. You are beautiful, but you look even more
 beautiful with wet hair. My issue is that as much
 as I dislike you, I like you. Shani, get lost from here
 in two minutes or else I will teach you a lesson you will not forget all your life. What will you do? What will you do? Have you gone mad? I am telling you, leave me or I will do something with you that you will remember. What will you do? You don’t agree? You don’t get it? 
You wont leave me? Anyway, don’t worry. I am here with you, child, so you don’t need to worry at all, and no one will take 
you out of this home. Had you told me this 
earlier, then you wouldn’t have had to 
go through this test. I wanted to tell you, but uncle, I couldn’t 
gather the courage. I felt that if I tell you and you don’t believe me, then what would happen to me? Anyway, you don’t need 
to be scared now, and don’t worry. Okay? Madam Ramsha Yes? Madam is asking if you have made preparations
 to go to the parlor. Have you kept your things? Yes. Tell aunt, I have kept everything. Fine, I will tell her. Do you have any idea how depressed you 
have made brother? Earlier, you ruined the relation
 between Afnan and Alizay, and now you are making the 
father fight with the son. No. I didn’t listen to Afnan earlier, and neither will I agree to him in future. I was just going to tell uncle, that I am ready to go to that home. Ramsha, I want to talk to you
 about something important. I don’t want to talk to 
you about anything. Please Ramsha,
 listen to me. I told you, I don’t want to talk 
to you about anything, nor do I want to listen to you, then why are you bothering me? Look, answer me, I promise you, after that 
I wont disturb you. Give me the answer for a few
 questions of mine, that’s it. I have no answer… Ramsha. Ramsha, I will have to go, I will talk to you later. Ramsha. Yes, aunt? Ramsha, did you keep 
all the things? yes. Check once more. What if you leave something, then you will have to come again. Nothing is left aunt, I have kept everything. Fine. Come on, then. Did you see? Mr. Qasim gave such 
amazing dowry. The whole neighbourhood 
was looking. He just gave a little small furniture. Hey, I told him not to. Those people were getting a
 really big set of the furniture. Ramsha had even sent me pictures. What? You told her not to? Yes, yes, I said no, that hey, what will we do 
with such big furniture when it wont fit in the room? You are such an stupid woman. You should have taken it. You surprise me. Hey, after some time, we would have given
 the big furniture set, and got a small one made, we would have got some money. Mr. Qasim has already 
done so much, we should be thankful for it. You know, if I speak the truth, even if brother Sajid was there, he wouldn’t have been able to 
do so much for Ramsha. Hey, what do they say? The party has just begun. You wait and watch, what happens next. I feel Mr. Qasim will give a high level thing that 
suits him in the wedding gift. I have told Shani, if he asks you, then feel shy and ask for a car. Hey, what are you saying? Would it look nice
 asking for it like this? Tsk. Tsk. What will he
 think about us, that we are such greedy people. You know, if I say 
something, Anwar, Shani’s position in Mr. Qasim’s 
eyes is not that good. Whatever respect is left, will end with us asking for things. You know, you are right. If Shani asks for a car 
shamelessly before marriage, then he will get degraded 
in Mr. Qasim’s eyes. After all, we should
 have the eggs, and not slaughter the chicken. You are right. Is that my phone ringing? Where is my phone? It is over there. I don’t know when this
 man’s greed will end. This is the limit. May God guide him, and put 
some sense in him. I am tired of his greed. Yes? Sir, she left. Where did she go? She went to the parlor to get ready. Fine, you leave. Okay tell me, why are you worried? Thank God you didn’t say 
why are you worrying me, or else my heart would have broken. Really? You have such a weak heart? Yes, it is a little extra weak in your case. Okay, I will test you some time. No, no, Afnan, don’t do 
anything like that, I will not be able to tolerate it. Because, I too am thinking now that I stop talking to you. Hey, why? What? What are you thinking? Speak up. I am thinking that if I had not come to 
meet you, then would have you really 
stopped talking to me? Yes, I would have surely 
stopped talking to you. You don’t meet me,
 nor talk to me, then why should 
I talk to you. After all, so many 
days have passed, now you should 
understand me well. I am thinking. Whenever I have called 
you in trouble, you come. The problem is, you get 
into trouble a lot. You wont get into any 
other trouble, right? If I get stuck, you are there. You will never learn. and the police put 
the entire blame on me. I don’t know what
 I would have done, had you not come? I don’t know what 
I would have done, Ramsha, how could I not come? It was you. I had to come for you at any cost. And I know, you have
 not done anything. You are being framed 
in this matter. But I am with you, Ramsha. I will not leave you alone 
in this difficult time. Afnan. Yes? Where are you lost? You didn’t even take out 
clothes for the wedding. Tell me, I will take it out. Yes, take out anything. What do you mean 
I take out anything? You will tell me, and I will take out the 
same clothes. I am telling you, whatever clothes you pick 
for me, I will wear them. No issues. Afnan, I am seeing that 
you are not happy. You are not participating i
n any activity of the wedding, you are not taking interest
 in anything. What is the issue? I feel that you are not happy in 
Ramsha’s wedding. In fact, you are sad that 
she is leaving this home. I do feel sad. Not because Ramsha 
is getting married, but because she is marrying Shani. I don’t think Shani is 
worthy of Ramsha in anyway. He doesn’t deserve her. You see yourself, Ramsha is so well mannered, will he ever be able
 to keep her happy? This will never happen,
 that is why, yes I have no happiness 
of this wedding. Shani is her choice. She is marrying out of her will. She is getting married, he is her cousin, why do you have an issue? I knew it. I knew you would never
 be able to understand this, because you only 
care about yourself. Yes, Jamshed, where are you? No. No. No. You do one thing, you go straight to the hall I will pick Ramsha myself. Yes, I am saying go to the hall, I will pick her and bring her. Fine. Immediately. 
Reach there immediately. You? Yes, the driver was busy, so I thought I would pick you. Come on. Come on. I had to talk to you about
 something important. I didn’t get a chance, so I thought I would pick you up. Ramsha, do you like Shani? What sort of a question 
is this, Afnan? Obviously, I like him,
 that is why I am marrying him. You are lying. I don’t believe this. You are lying. You don’t like Shani. Maybe you don’t know Ramsha, I had heard everything you and Shani 
talked about on the day of the mayun. How can you marry him 
even after all this? Look, you try and understand me, I want your betterment, 
I want good for you. If you were marrying a good man, if you were doing it by your choice. Such a man who would 
keep you happy, with whom you
 would stay happy, then I wouldn’t say all 
this to you, Ramsha. But Shani? I cannot tolerate his
 behavior towards you, then how will you tolerate it? I am not answerable to 
you for everything, Afnan. Just know that some helplessness are
 the shackles in a person’s foot. After all, it is really late, we should go now. Drive the car, please. But I will not let you 
get married to him. You are getting married 
out of helplessness, but after this marriage 
your life can get ruined, and I will not let you ruin your life. You will not get married, that’s it. You are not driving the car? No, I wont go. Fine. I will go myself. Okay. Okay. Listen to me, please. Close the door of the car. What are you doing? Whatever I am doing is
 for your betterment. Why don’t you understand me,
 Ramsha. Nor can I take you to the hall, neither can I let you get off here. How do I let you get off? You will get off from the 
car at this hour of the night, dressed up like this, as a bride, and you feel I will leave you 
in the middle of the road? Really? I think you have forgotten. You had left me midway like this earlier. If I am marrying Shani, then why are you worried? If I stand midway,
 in the middle of the road, then why do you worry? Why? Because…
