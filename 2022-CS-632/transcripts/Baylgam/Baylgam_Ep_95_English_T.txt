[21.80] Is the shoot done?
[23.12] Yes. 
Show me, how are the videos?
[25.28] This video was better than before.
[27.28] I think this time we will get 
more response.
[31.28] Leave it.
[33.52] We have tried making in every way.
[35.36] We didn’t get more views on any video.
[43.28] I don’t know how do Tik Tokers 
get so much views, man.
[46.84] We didn’t even get a good payment 
till now.
[50.52] I think we will have to do something else 
to make the video.
[52.76] That’s how we can get famous.
[67.60] Hey, this is the shopping girl Ramsha. 
You wait here, I will come. Okay?
[78.80] Hi Ramsha. How are you?
[88.52] Did you not recognize me?
[90.32] I am Areeba, Hania’s friend.
[92.12] We met in Islamabad.
[102.96] And we also shot two commercials 
together.
[111.80] What happened, man?
[113.52] I should have difficulty recognizing you.
[120.36] You have changed your entire dressing.
[122.80] Nothing like that, I recognize you.
[125.52] How are you?
Are you fine?
[127.04] I am absolutely fine. 
You tell me, how are you?
[131.08] I don’t believe that you have changed
your dressing so much.
[133.80] Come on we will sit and talk somewhere.
[136.08] You met me after so long.
[138.84] No, no, I cannot go to the cafeteria.
[140.92] I have been told to wait here.
[143.04] Why buddy? Come on.
[147.60] You know you have changed 
your dressing so much,
[150.64] I cannot even recognize 
if you are the same Ramsha.
[160.56] This veil, this scarf, 
so much seriousness.
[164.24] Unbelievable, man.
[165.88] Yes, thank God, 
I have changed a lot.
[168.92] I have quit everything.
[170.60] Why? You were so famous?
[173.00] Then why did you step back?
[176.84] A person does what God wills.
[179.40] I am really thankful to God that 
He saved me from all the bad things
[184.32] that I was doing in my life.
[189.56] And without a doubt a person does 
what God wills.
[193.52] You believe me, I am really satisfied 
with my life and I am really happy.
[197.40] The person’s betterment is walking 
on the right path.
[207.08] Hello.
[208.24] Yes. Yes, Afnan. I am standing in 
the food court. Where are you?
[211.96] Where?
[214.16] Goodbye.
[215.48] Oh, boyfriend?
[217.32] No, he is my husband.
[218.80] I just told you I have quit everything.
[221.92] Hey come on, man, I am joking.
[223.76] Okay fine, okay, bye.
[226.88] Ahmad come quickly.
[271.96] Greetings, guys. I hope you people
 will be fine.
[274.48] So I have a big surprise for you 
and that surprise is that
[277.80] what is a famous Tik Toker, Ramsha,
called Shopping girl,
[281.48] doing nowadays, what she is not doing, 
where she is right now.
[284.92] I am going to tell you all this 
in my video today.
[287.76] I am sure you people would 
want to know
[289.60] that the girl the condition the girl 
who did wonders on social media is in.
[292.84] After going viral in one video 
on social media
[295.12] in one night, Ramsha said goodbye 
to social media,
[298.08] and has married a famous businessman 
in the city, Afnan Qasim.
[301.68] I am sure you will not believe all this,
[304.12] that is why I have proof of all this. 
Look at this video.
[443.04] Hello.
[445.20] This is Fahad. 
How are you?
[449.32] Fahad!
[450.52] Where are you lost? 
You called after so long.
[454.68] Hey, I am here. 
Where will I go?
[457.80] I felt that you got married,
[460.48] you didn’t call for so many days.
[464.04] Man, when do we have such luck.
[470.24] You know, I am not getting married once,
[472.20] and people have gotten married twice.
[480.92] Some people are so lucky, right?
[483.64] Now who got married for a second time?
[486.32] Afnan, who else?
[493.92] What?
[499.36] What are you trying to say?
[501.80] Hey, I called to congratulate you 
on Afnan’s second marriage.
[515.32] I thought he got married again 
with your permission.
[530.04] That’s why he showed so much courage,
[531.96] and put it on social media.
[534.28] What nonsense is this?
[542.24] You called to pull this 
cheap prank on me.
[546.28] Neither is this a prank, 
nor is it cheap.
[557.36] Hearing you talk I feel that 
he has also fooled you.
[576.32] And when you don’t know about 
his second marriage,
[579.76] then how would you know who he 
got married for the second time?
[591.40] Okay, I will tell you.
[604.72] Your beautiful co-wife’s name is…
[615.36] Ramsha.
[635.40] And now instead of arguing with me,
 watch the video I am sending you.
[654.84] Then maybe you will believe me,
[665.24] that your husband too has become 
really viral like that shopping girl Ramsha.
[670.88] I am sending it, check it out.
[749.32] After going viral in one video 
on social media
[751.80] in one night, Ramsha said goodbye 
to social media,
[754.76] and has married a famous businessman
in the city, Afnan Qasim.
[758.24] I am sure you will not believe all this,
[760.68] that is why I have proof of all this.
Look at this video.
[805.64] It was Afnan, Alizay. 
My eyes cannot deceive me.
[815.72] Why are you smiling?
[818.80] Mama, because this is not the fault of 
your eyes, in fact, it is the fault of your heart.
[823.76] You love Afnan so much.
[826.48] That’s why you see him everywhere.
[828.92] Now you remember, when your 
friend’s daughter got married,
[832.28] even there you found a boy 
just like Afnan,
[835.24] but it was someone else.
[838.08] Alizay,
[839.60] feeling it was Afnan and it being Afnan
are two separate things.
[844.80] It was Afnan,
[846.56] whether you accept it or not.
[848.68] Mama, I still called Afnan 
after you told me,
[851.28] he was in a meeting at that time.
[855.96] Afnan, whose voice was that? 
Where are you?
[859.72] What is wrong with you, Alizay?
[861.20] I am at the restaurant.
[863.24] My colleagues are with me.
[865.00] A colleague of mine asked about tea.
[867.84] Okay, listen, the meeting is about to start, 
I will call you back. Bye.
[871.48] Hel…
[879.64] You are here?
[882.60] What are you doing here?
[885.16] I had told you it is Zohaib and 
Sana’s anniversary,
[889.52] I came to shop for that.
[891.68] What are you doing here?
[893.24] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[895.12] Coincidentally I came to 
shop here as well.
[899.60] For whom?
[902.24] For you.
[903.44] Who else will I shop for Alizay? 
I bought all this for you.
[908.56] You got all this for me.
[910.28] I actually wanted to surprise you,
[913.36] but you caught me here.
[930.76] Hello.
[931.96] Yes, Afnan, where are you?
[936.44] I am in the office. Why? 
What happened? All okay?
[942.56] Okay, you are in the office.
[947.28] Yes, I am in the office, 
I have an important meeting.
[950.28] What happened? 
Did you want something?
[952.08] Fine, you do your meeting. Okay.
[959.88] Why are you so worried?
[961.32] What is wrong, Alizay? 
Why are you doing this?
[963.16] What am I doing?
[964.48] Now what torment have you brought 
on my head after, Ramsha.
[967.52] Alizay, talk slowly. I am giving you 
the last warning.
[970.52] Don’t do all this…
[971.72] Tell me honestly, who was that girl?
[973.60] It is good that everyone should find out, 
how you are cheating me…
[976.40] Shut up.
[985.64] Just shut up.
[989.40] Get out of this place.
[991.64] Get out of this place right now.
[1000.68] What do you think? You will blame me
again and again
[1003.56] and I will admit it in front of everyone.
[1005.32] Your issue is that I come to talk to you,
[1008.52] you shout, you misbehave.
[1010.68] So why should I not shout?
[1012.36] I will shout louder and tell everyone 
he cheated me.
[1015.56] I cheated you, right? Fine, 
then you do one thing,
[1018.12] don’t live with me.
[1024.88] But today, tell me this clearly.
[1027.32] My mind too will be clear, so I will make
 some arrangements for this.
[1032.52] For God’s sake, you people be quiet.
[1038.28] It would be much better if you make 
your daughter understand this.
[1092.48] Look Afnan is getting married,
[1095.76] he will not give you importance 
after marriage.
[1101.64] Then what will you do?
[1104.52] You will sit alone and get bored.
[1110.24] That’s why I am saying be my friend.
[1113.64] Hey, wait.
[1114.92] Get out of my way.
[1116.64] I am talking about coming close to you.
[1119.16] I mean,
[1120.76] our hearts will come close 
if we become friends,
[1125.00] you are making me move.
[1127.56] This….look, Ramsha,
[1131.32] believe me.
[1133.96] I will make you have a lot more fun 
than Afnan.
[1142.44] Cheap man!
[1161.00] Afnan.
[1174.88] What was happening?
[1177.20] Alizay had told me to drop Ramsha
 to the academy.
[1185.24] I don’t know what happened to my car, 
it is stopping again and again.
[1194.32] You did good that you came.
[1196.56] Why don’t you drop her?
[1198.92] I will take my car to the mechanic, huh?
[1210.32] I had told you. 
How did you even dare?
[1213.84] What is wrong, Afnan?
[1214.76] When I had told you to stay away from 
that girl, then how did you even dare?
[1217.40] You did something so cheap with her, 
that I don’t believe it.
[1223.12] What are you doing, man? 
Leave me, people are watching.
[1225.04] Everyone is watching?
[1226.28] Everyone should find out. This man…
[1228.56] he is a harasser.
[1231.36] He took advantage of the helplessness 
of a helpless, oppressed girl.
[1234.76] He harassed her.
[1236.08] I am ashamed calling you 
my friend today.
[1238.36] Hey a cheap man like you shouldn’t
be a part of this society.
[1242.92] Leave me.
[1245.96] Is she your lover that you are insulting 
your friend because of her?
[1275.04] Every man doesn’t have a 
bad character like you.
[1283.72] Neither do I have anything like that 
about her,
[1288.68] nor is she bad character.
[1292.00] And after today,
[1294.52] if I even see you near Ramsha,
[1298.80] I will kill you.
[1301.24] Understand?
[1351.96] Greetings.
[1383.28] What happened?
[1385.08] Is everything okay? 
Why are you people…
[1393.28] so serious?
[1406.08] Alizay.
[1426.04] What happened?
[1428.28] Why is everyone like…
[1455.76] Were you not ashamed cheating me?
[1460.04] You were unfaithful to me, Afnan.
[1475.20] What did you think? 
I will not find out.
[1492.64] Why don’t you say anything? 
Answer me.
[1504.52] You think I am mad, 
you think I am stupid.
[1516.00] You married that Ramsha.
[1533.52] You cheated me.
[1536.24] I was saying this from day one.
[1547.40] And you kept on denying me. 
You married her, right?
[1566.04] Tell me, why did you do this?
[1568.56] Answer me.
[1571.16] You have no answer.
[1585.16] What will you say?
[1590.32] You will deny it in front of everyone.
[1592.80] I will show you, your video.
[1596.12] Alizay, this…
Hold this. Watch it.
[1598.60] Who is this? Watch it.
[1600.56] Greetings, guys. 
I hope you people will be fine.
[1602.76] So I have a big surprise for you 
and that surprise is that
[1606.04] what is a famous Tik Toker, Ramsha, 
called Shopping girl, doing nowadays,
[1611.64] what she is not doing, 
where she is right now.
[1613.64] I am going to tell you all this 
in my video today.
[1616.20] I am sure you people would 
want to know
[1617.96] that the girl the condition the girl 
who did wonders on social media is in.
[1621.00] After going viral in one video 
on social media
[1623.32] in one night, Ramsha said goodbye 
to social media,
[1626.36] and has married a famous businessman 
in the city, Afnan Qasim.
[1629.88] I am sure you will not believe all this,
[1632.32] that is why I have proof of all this. 
Look at this video.
[1712.48] All this…
[1736.28] Afnan,
[1738.80] I trusted you more than my daughter.
[1755.16] I supported you in everything.
[1776.84] I always loved you like my own child,
[1780.36] and you?
[1782.12] What did you give to me in return?
[1795.08] Huh?
[1797.12] Sorrow, pain, torture.
[1815.76] Do you have any idea Afnan,
what you have done?
[1821.60] Aunt.
[1823.92] Aunt, I am sorry.
[1825.80] I know whatever 
I did must have hurt you,
[1829.20] but hear me out once…
But what?
[1832.04] But what, Afnan?
[1834.80] You married Ramsha.
[1844.04] What were you thinking 
when you did this?
[1853.76] You brought a co-wife on my daughter.
[1869.04] You didn’t think about your wife,
nor did you think about your future child.
[1872.52] Meaning, you became so selfish…
[1874.68] you should have cared about someone.
[1877.48] Afnan, you ruined everything.
[1889.84] I…
[1891.96] I used to tell brother to drag out 
this girl from this home.
[1896.76] She is a snake.
[1907.52] She bit us.
[1909.44] She bit everyone.
[1936.48] You ended it all.
[1966.64] Afnan, stay away from me.
[1971.92] Please stay away from me.
[1975.12] Alizay, listen to me with a cool head.
I am telling you, you…
[1978.80] I don’t want to hear anything.
[1981.20] You did what you wanted to.
