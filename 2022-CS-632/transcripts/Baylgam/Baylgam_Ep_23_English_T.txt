[22.16] Alizay, I was leaving for the office,
should I drop…
[25.84] Drop you off?
[28.04] Yes, I’m just getting ready, 
then you can.
[30.28] Okay, I’m waiting for you downstairs,
come.
[36.36] What, man! Come.
[38.32] Who keeps calling you? 
That you’re declining?
[41.16] I don’t know, it’s an unknown number 
calling,
[43.20] I don’t pick up because it might be 
someone just bothering me.
[45.52] So, what year is going on?
[48.84] 2023
[50.28] Yes, it’s not 1905,
[52.44] there is the option to block on our phones, 
you can use that.
[56.40] You know, I am not technically 
sound at all.
[59.36] But that’s a good idea, I’ll block it.
[61.36] Come on now, I’ll wait for you. 
Yes, coming coming.
[75.48] Sister-in-law, I’d suggest you should 
talk to brother Sajid as soon as possible,
[79.84] and get the date for a wedding instead 
of an engagement.
[83.56] Nabeel’s mother called, 
she’s giving a proposal,
[86.92] you shouldn’t delay it,
invite them over.
[89.76] Tell me,
[91.36] were you the one to receive their call?
[93.36] Yes sister-in-law, she called me herself, 
I talked to her.
[97.88] Can I tell you something?
[99.36] This proposal is no less than 
a miracle for Ramsha.
[103.84] Once this wedding takes place,
[106.40] people will shut up.
[109.00] Because Nabeel’s mother herself called,
[111.36] she is willing to come over, 
she is offering a proposal,
[113.56] you shouldn’t delay it, invite them over.
[116.52] Look Salma,
[118.44] I also want to marry off Ramsha 
as soon as possible.
[124.64] But…
[126.12] But what, sister-in-law?
[134.84] Do one thing,
[136.96] tell them to give us some time, not now.
[141.00] You can invite them over after a while.
[143.04] Sister-in-law, if you want to accept it,
[146.08] why are you wasting time like this?
[151.44] Okay, I will do as you say.
[195.68] Do you not understand what 
I have told you once, Ramsha?
[198.56] Afnan, don’t talk to me in this tone.
[202.48] Then, what do I do?
[203.96] You are practically forcing me 
to talk to you like this.
[209.12] You have messed up my life, 
why don’t you understand this?
[212.68] So many calls, so many messages.
[215.24] I’ll have to block your number.
[218.04] Afnan, my family is forcing me 
to marry somewhere else,
[222.80] that’s why I have been calling and 
texting you again and again.
[225.60] Oh man, then what do I do?
[228.44] Marry if you want, don’t if you don’t.
[231.52] But stop bothering me.
[233.72] Afnan,
[235.36] please think about me once, just once.
[239.84] Look, my decision is final, 
now please don’t bother me again.
[248.92] Okay,
[250.84] I’m telling you one last time,
[254.24] if you don’t meet me,
[256.00] if you don’t listen to me,
[260.80] I’ll kill myself.
[263.76] Okay,
[265.40] I’ll meet you, but it’ll be our last meeting.
[271.24] Time will decide that for us, not you.
[291.52] Now tell me fast, what’s the matter?
[294.04] Ramsha, hurry up, 
I’ve left my work for this.
[297.80] Yes, Afnan,
[299.64] I had to discuss something important.
[304.28] Look, I know I made a mistake,
[307.92] I shouldn’t have forced you 
so early for marriage.
[311.48] Obviously, no one would have accepted
getting married so soon.
[316.28] I was just trying to tell you…
[319.96] Just once,
[321.64] meet my parents and convince them,
[324.48] after that, you can take as much time 
as you want for the wedding,
[327.92] I’ll handle my parents then, 
just meet them once and convince…
[330.72] Wait a minute,
[333.84] are you mad, or do you think 
I am mad?
[338.04] No, I mean, please let me know.
[342.12] What do you think,
[344.08] I’m not marrying you, 
because I am busy with my work?
[348.68] Yes. 
Have you gone mad?
[352.12] Have you lost your mind?
[355.00] How can you even think that 
I can marry you?
[358.12] It’s my mistake, it’s on me.
[360.72] I shouldn’t have kept a friendship with you,
but I had lost my mind,
[364.08] I thought she is an innocent girl 
who kept getting in trouble
[366.68] so let’s help her but you…
[369.64] You are running after me.
[373.48] And why would I marry you?
[376.68] Who are you? 
What is special about you?
[380.36] You left your studies,
[382.56] I have no idea about your family,
[385.96] and you…
[387.00] You post your videos on social media 
to get famous, and I’ll marry you?
[395.40] You even left your own parents 
to be with me,
[399.84] you didn’t even care about their honor,
[402.52] how would you uphold my honor?
[407.56] The one who isn’t loyal to her parents,
[410.40] won’t be loyal to me either.
[413.04] You have no idea about the importance
of relationships, Ramsha.
[416.92] You only care about you,
your happiness.
[419.96] And I’ll marry you…
[423.88] And yes, about what you were saying,
[426.96] this isn’t about love,
[429.36] I came here for sympathy.
[432.24] I came to help you as sympathy
[435.24] so you could take home some 
of your leftover grace,
[439.48] but no…
[441.08] I didn’t know you would become 
my headache.
[445.60] And yes, another thing,
[448.20] thank God that it was me,
[451.76] and I was raised really well,
[455.20] if it were any other guy instead of me,
[458.44] he would have walked all over your honor.
[478.56] Let’s forget what happened,
[482.80] remember, one thing only,
[486.44] you and I cannot get married.
[491.84] So don’t dare call me again.
[502.56] We’ll never meet again,
[504.92] take care,
[507.68] bye.
[569.96] Afnan, listen. 
Yes?
[571.84] I have to go to the office early tomorrow,
[573.76] please take me with you, okay?
[576.32] Okay.
[577.64] Sure.
[578.64] Listen, listen, listen. 
Yes?
[582.32] Aleezay, should we go out somewhere?
To hang out? Please.
[586.92] At this time?
[587.92] Is it prohibited to go out at this time?
[590.20] I’ve been getting bored for so long,
[592.48] there’s nothing good on TV either.
[594.36] Let’s do one thing, let’s go 
on a long drive.
[596.88] You know I could really use a
long drive right now,
[600.44] I’m getting suffocated staying 
at home like this.
[604.64] It feels like I’ll get sick.
[607.20] We’ll go out and sit in some 
open space, okay?
[609.52] And if you feel like it, 
we will eat something.
[613.28] Okay, let’s go.
[616.08] Thank you, go and get ready, 
I’ll also get ready.
[618.68] I’ll change and be back. 
Okay.
[626.92] What do you think,
[629.08] I’m not marrying you, because 
I am busy with my work?
[633.32] Yes. 
Have you gone mad?
[637.04] Have you lost your mind?
[639.84] How can you even think that 
I can marry you?
[643.04] It’s my mistake, it’s on me.
[645.60] I shouldn’t have kept a friendship with you,
but I had lost my mind,
[648.96] I thought she is an innocent girl 
who keeps getting in trouble
[651.40] so let’s help her but you…
[654.44] You are running after me.
[658.52] You even left your own parents 
to be with me,
[662.80] you didn’t even care about their honor,
[665.36] how would you uphold my honor?
[670.40] The one who isn’t loyal to her parents,
[673.32] won’t be loyal to me either.
[676.04] You have no idea about the importance
of relationships, Ramsha.
[679.88] You only care about you, 
your happiness.
[688.64] Thank God that it was me,
[692.40] and I was raised really well,
[695.72] if it were any other guy instead of me,
[699.00] he would have walked all over your honor.
[726.88] Hey, Ramsha?
[728.36] Ramsha? What happened? 
What happened, my child?
[731.40] Mother…
Hey, what happened?
[733.24] Mother. 
What happened?
[735.08] This Shani…
[739.80] Shani…
[743.20] Can I tell you something?
[744.84] This proposal is no less than 
a miracle for Ramsha.
[749.04] Once this wedding takes place,
[751.52] people will shut up.
[754.28] Because Nabeel’s mother herself called,
[756.40] she is willing to come over, 
she is offering a proposal,
[758.88] you shouldn’t delay it, 
invite them over.
[774.28] Ramsha?
[776.36] What happened, my child?
[778.44] Mother…
[781.52] What happened?
[785.04] Why are you crying?
[786.40] Mother, I’m really scared,
[790.12] really scared mother.
[793.36] What happened, my child?
[794.72] Ramsha? Why are you scared?
[797.44] Did someone say something to you?
[799.48] Did Shani say something?
[800.60] No, nobody said anything, 
I’m just really scared.
[805.20] Why, my child? Why are you scared?
[807.20] And what are you scared of?
[809.16] I’m getting scared of myself, 
I feel like I am terrible,
[814.12] like I’m really bad, I am getting 
terrified mother.
[816.76] My child…
I don’t feel good.
[818.76] No, my love, there’s nothing like that,
 it’s not like this,
[821.52] nothing like this, 
don’t think about it.
[823.56] You don’t know, mother. 
You don’t know what I just saw.
[826.20] I saw that I am really scary 
from within,
[829.52] and really bad, really dirty
[831.84] and I’m not good, mother, 
I’m terrible…
[834.40] No, my child.
[835.76] Look, you must have had a nightmare,
[838.32] I told you to recite the prayers
before sleeping,
[842.04] you must have forgotten about it, 
that’s why you are scared.
[844.84] It was a dream my child, 
nothing to do with reality.
[848.40] It was a dream, mother? 
Yes, my love.
[850.32] And I am here with you, you don’t have
anything to be afraid of.
[854.24] Mother. 
Mother?
[856.36] Don’t leave me alone, 
I am really scared,
[859.36] please don’t leave me. 
No, my child, how can I leave you?
[863.00] I am here for you. 
I am with you.
[870.04] Don’t be scared, 
I will sit with you,
[874.20] good job.
[897.32] Ramsha,
[899.84] that Sister Sabia…
[903.72] she has told me about some old man,
[906.68] I’m thinking of visiting him today,
[911.04] I’ll get an amulet for you too,
[913.28] the condition you were in yesterday?
I got really scared,
[917.72] I couldn’t see your condition.
[921.84] Listen?
[923.92] Did you talk to that man?
[930.68] Is he going to bring his family here 
for proposal or not?
[934.04] Did he say something?
[944.96] Ramsha?
[948.04] Mother, he left the country,
[953.20] I’m not in contact with him anymore.
[959.32] You can fix my marriage 
wherever you want.
[997.28] Ramsha.
[1000.64] Many congratulations,
[1002.32] the date is fixed for your wedding.
[1004.56] 20th of this month has been decided.
[1010.84] May God keep you very happy,
[1014.00] always smiling and giggling.
[1024.20] Are you happy?
[1035.12] You are lying.
[1037.32] Ramsha didn’t use to be happy like this,
[1039.96] when Ramsha is happy, 
she screams with excitement, yells,
[1042.52] she glows and most of all annoys me,
[1046.72] and you did none of these.
[1050.28] I told you.
[1053.16] We have to change ourselves with time.
[1057.64] No, Ramsha.
[1059.76] Don’t change yourself,
[1061.52] I like you how you are,
[1064.84] laughing, smiling, always making noise,
[1068.12] I like Ramsha like that.
[1072.24] Come on, let’s celebrate this day,
[1080.00] let’s make a nice video.
[1087.48] No, Annie.
[1090.04] I hate this phone.
[1092.44] I don’t want to make any videos.
[1098.28] How can you hate that?
[1100.32] This is a mere unconscious thing,
[1102.96] the mistake is ours,
[1105.60] and we should know how to use things.
[1115.28] You are right.
[1119.44] I wish I understood it earlier.
[1173.48] Mr. Qasim, I came to bother you.
[1177.84] It is my daughter’s wedding. 
You must come.
[1183.60] I am doing this wedding with simplicity.
[1188.92] I have only invited selected people.
[1191.16] May God bless. Congratulations.
[1194.28] May God bless you in this life and 
afterlife and bless her with the best fate.
[1201.00] Amen.
[1202.36] But… I…
[1205.32] I think I might be wrong, 
but you mentioned
[1208.40] you don’t have any children.
[1213.84] No, you must have misunderstood.
[1217.68] I told you that I don’t have any son.
I only have one daughter.
[1221.64] Yes, it might be so.
[1223.60] Daughters are also the blessing of God.
[1228.04] I will come for sure.
[1229.60] 26th of the month.
[1233.56] As far as I remember,
[1236.64] I have to go to attend a meeting 
in Islamabad on that date but…
[1242.16] But if I won’t go, then I will come 
for sure, God willing.
[1244.64] Let me know if I can be of any help.
[1247.28] Thank you so much. 
Let me go.
[1248.92] I have to distribute some other cards.
[1250.64] May God help you fulfill all the tasks.
[1252.64] Thanks. Bye.
[1269.48] Father, whose card is it?
[1271.48] Greetings.
[1274.96] Greetings. Sorry, father.
[1276.80] Greetings first, then talk.
[1279.20] Mr. Sajid, the one who makes 
the ration packets…
[1284.68] It is his daughter’s wedding.
Okay, oh may God bless.
[1288.16] Father, I going to see uncle Bilal.
[1290.08] Let me know from where I should 
pick you on your way back.
[1293.00] No, no. You go and come back 
home directly.
[1295.60] I will take a while in the mosque.
[1297.16] The construction work of Imam Sb. 
is almost done.
[1300.60] Only a few things like 
sewage lines are left.
[1305.16] Father, you have already done enough.
[1308.00] What is the need to do more? 
I mean…
[1310.28] The mosque owners have already 
given him the two rooms.
[1313.16] It must be enough.
No, it’s not enough, son.
[1315.64] He has a family, children…
[1318.08] It’s not possible to live in a small home.
[1320.16] And when we are capable to help them,
[1323.88] so it is all about being honoured, right?
[1326.36] It is his service,
[1328.32] if we will also contribute a bit 
then there is no problem, right?
[1331.20] Okay, father.
Whatever you think is right.
[1333.84] I will leave now. Bye.
[1335.56] Live long. Live long. Bye.
[1339.12] Bye.
[1342.04] May God bless girls with good fate, 
and in return,
[1347.28] may He bless my daughter 
with good fate.
[1577.56] Brother, it is a good thing that 
you are thinking like this.
[1581.76] But what will I do after going there?
[1585.24] I mean…
[1587.04] These functions at small houses,
[1589.60] there is so much noise there, brother.
[1594.44] I can understand, Afsheen.
[1596.00] It’s their daughter’s wedding, otherwise,
I wouldn’t have said yes either.
[1599.92] He invited us with so much love
 and affection,
[1602.20] if we will not go, it won’t look good.
[1603.84] Brother, you are right.
[1606.36] But I have not met that family as of yet,
[1608.92] nor do I know any woman there.
[1611.28] You can take Afnan there, right?
[1614.24] Here you go, Afnan is here. 
He will go with you.
[1617.36] Where to go?
[1618.96] Dude, it is Sajid’s daughter’s wedding.
[1621.80] Is the wedding today?
[1623.16] No, no, it’s not today.
[1625.04] You know I have to go to attend 
the meeting in Islamabad.
[1627.64] So, I was thinking to give them 
the wedding gift at this time.
[1631.76] I wanted to go give them the envelope.
It’s just that.
[1633.52] But father, I am sorry.
I won’t be able to go with you.
[1637.36] You know Fahad? There is an event 
at his home too, so…
[1640.24] I wanted to go there.
[1642.36] Okay.
[1643.68] Your aunt says that there is too much 
noise in the functions at small homes,
[1647.52] there is an event at your friend’s house,
[1649.96] they are from lower class than us, right?
[1652.16] It a wedding in an ordinary person’s home,
[1655.12] so no one among you is interested.
[1657.32] If it were an invite from an affluent person,
[1660.48] so you would have been preparing for it 
a week prior to the event.
[1663.00] That is because you would have asked them 
to do some of your work, right?
[1665.76] Hey, I forgot that
[1667.72] no one meets anyone without getting 
any benefit or purpose nowadays.
[1671.84] Leave it, I will go on my own.
[1673.56] Father? Father, listen to me.
Brother?
[1677.24] Brother is just so kind to everyone.
[1681.28] Even he doesn’t need to go there.
[1683.72] If he wants to give them the envelope,
[1685.60] any servant would have delivered it too.
[1687.60] No, no, aunt. Father is absolutely right.
[1691.48] Father is offended. 
I think I should go with them.
[1694.08] I… I will go now. Bye.
[1708.76] Father?
[1710.00] There is no name plate here.
[1711.40] How will we get to know that 
it is their house?
[1712.80] Hey, he told me this same address
[1714.68] that it’s the fourth house from the road 
and this black gate. It is the same.
[1716.80] Yes, father. But don’t you have his number?
[1718.92] Call and ask him. What is his name?
[1721.24] Sajid. We knocked and rang the bell.
[1723.88] Now let’s wait patiently, right?
[1725.08] The order is to wait after knocking thrice. 
They will come in a while.
[1727.36] Let me knock one more time.
[1729.40] Here you go…
Who is…
[1731.48] Greetings.
[1733.76] Mr. Qasim, Mr. Qasim.
[1735.64] An honourable person like you 
in my home…
[1738.56] Thanks a lot.
I had to come, right?
[1740.76] Thanks a lot.
Greetings.
[1742.24] Come on in. Welcome.
Come, come.
[1744.12] Come, son.
Come.
[1749.40] Greetings.
[1751.48] Thank you so much for coming.
[1753.36] Come.
[1754.80] Son, make him sit.
Greetings. How are you?
[1756.84] Come here.
Greetings.
[1758.16] Have a seat.
Thanks a lot.
[1759.56] Have a seat.
Thanks.
[1760.80] Have a seat.
[1762.48] What is all this?
 Why did you bother?
[1764.96] Hey, no, no. It is just…
[1766.24] Hey? What was the need for this? 
It was enough that you came.
[1769.00] Hey, there is indeed no need. But…
[1772.52] She is our daughter. And daughters
belong to everyone, right?
[1776.20] You just give this to my daughter 
as a gift from my side.
[1778.36] Thanks a lot.
[1779.48] You are coming to the wedding, right?
[1781.08] Yes, God willing. I will try my best
[1783.20] but I think I have a meeting 
in Islamabad so if it would be,
[1786.04] I won’t be able to come. Otherwise, 
I would try my best.
[1811.36] I should tell everything 
about Afnan to father.
[1817.64] How can I marry anyone else?
[1823.48] Where is my gift?
[1825.68] Madam, the flowers that I brought, 
these are your gift.
[1829.52] These?
Yes.
[1830.68] I don’t need flowers.
[1832.00] They will wither by tomorrow.
[1833.88] Hey, wow.
[1835.60] It is a fact, by the way.
[1837.00] Sometimes, you speak very logically.
[1840.00] These flowers will wither by tomorrow.
[1842.20] Then let’s do one thing. 
I owe you your gift.
[1846.44] Sure?
Sure.
[1853.76] Where did you buy these bangles?
These are so nice.
[1856.16] These are made of glass.
[1857.76] Yes, what if they are made of glass?
[1859.28] They are looking nice, right?
[1860.88] That is amazing. 
Who likes bangles made of glass?
[1863.20] You like them.
[1864.36] I really like it when girls wear bangles.
[1867.04] But they are looking so special 
in your wrists.
[1871.12] Tell me already how did your day go?
I am not telling you.
[1877.04] Okay, dude. Here you go.
[1878.96] I have put the ice-cream aside.
I turned off the phone.
[1881.60] Let me know how did your day go? 
What has happened?
[1884.68] Ramsha? Where are you going?
[1888.00] I am going to talk to father.
[1890.80] I asked brother.
[1892.36] There are so many guests outside.
[1896.44] Well, don’t worry.
Let me go check outside.
[1898.76] Then you can come, okay?
[1923.04] I must talk to father.
[1969.12] What are you doing here?
[1972.56] Do you want to elope again?
[1975.16] We would be further degraded.
[1978.48] I am finding father. 
I need to talk to him.
[1980.64] About what do you want to talk to him?
[1982.32] You can talk to him as he comes inside.
[1985.04] And can’t you do anything properly?
[1987.16] What have I done?
[1988.76] What did you do?
It’s your henna day today.
[1991.16] You are going outside like this.
[1994.08] Can’t you see how many guests are here?
[1996.68] Go sit in your room silently.
[1997.80] Talk to him when he would come inside.
[1999.24] I want to talk to father. I will go inside 
after talking to him.
[2001.80] Speak slowly.
[2005.64] Go to your room. He will come inside. 
Then you can talk to him.
[2007.88] Come on.
[2045.36] Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot.
[2048.60] May God help you fulfill 
all the tasks properly.
[2050.40] Thanks a lot. Come on.
[2052.20] No, no.
Hey, no.
[2053.68] Hey, no, no.
Hey, brother Sajid???
[2055.52] You just come.
Thanks a lot.
[2057.16] Greetings.
Come.
[2065.72] Here you go.
[2067.92] Drink the milk and drink it 
in front of me.
[2069.84] Don’t leave it like you did yesterday. 
Come on.
[2072.44] Mother, I will drink it in a while.
[2074.52] Don’t worry.
[2077.28] Tell me, who came to meet father today?
[2080.92] Their voices sounded very familiar.
[2083.16] Were they relatives?
[2085.28] Don’t know, child. I didn’t see.
[2087.08] Maybe they will be your father’s customers.
[2089.52] They must have come to meet him.
[2091.48] Hey? What are you doing?
[2093.48] Wear them.
[2094.60] You must not remove them till your wedding.
Come on. Wear them.
[2097.64] Mother?
[2098.76] I am getting so uncomfortable 
wearing these bangles
[2101.24] and I will also change clothes 
after removing these.
[2103.32] I cannot wear such heavy clothes 
and bangles in summers.
[2107.96] No, child.
[2110.28] Bangles look so good on brides’ hands.
[2113.24] Do get ready after getting married.
[2117.44] And you really like makeup.
[2120.36] Do get ready properly.
[2123.76] May God make you stay happy.
[2134.24] How should I tell you, mother?
[2137.08] I no longer long for anything.
[2147.76] Will you also go to Fahad’s house?
[2149.88] Yes, father. I told him I would be late.
[2153.28] You can go after dropping me.
[2155.76] Hey, no issues, father.
[2157.12] I will drop you easily and will go then.
[2159.36] And I will come back early too.
[2162.44] Infact, let me call him.
[2166.16] What happened? 
What are you looking for?
[2168.60] I can’t find my phone.
[2174.32] Oh.
[2175.56] Father, I think I forgot my phone there.
[2179.48] Well done.
[2180.76] I am getting old, 
and you are forgetting things.
[2184.16] Let me call Sajid.
[2186.48] Your phone must be there. 
Just turn the car.
[2189.16] Yes. Sorry, father.
[2194.40] Mehnaz?
[2196.44] Hey, where are you?
[2198.88] Ramsha? Look someone forgot 
their mobile.
[2201.88] Really?
Hmm.
[2203.04] Okay.
[2215.28] What happened, child?
[2216.96] Father, a girl gave me this phone 
that someone forgot their…
[2220.16] Hey, I am looking for this for quite a while.
[2222.68] It is Mr. Qasim’s son’s mobile.
[2224.64] Brother Sajid, Mr. Qasim is here.
[2226.24] Yes, yes. It is Mr. Qasim’s son’s phone.
[2228.60] You go, I am coming.
I need to give it to him.
