You are hiding something or else why would 
your heart do this? Tell me, did Afsheen 
say something or Alizay? No, no uncle, 
there is nothing like that. Don’t worry. Do you trust me? Yes, but sort of a question is this? If I tell you something,
 then will you believe me? Yes, child, why wont I believe you? You wanted to tell me something. Tell me, what are you thinking about? Oh, sorry. Yes, greetings. Yes, Mr. Azam. Yes, you talk to him. You ask him when does he 
want to have the meeting. Yes, you were saying 
something, Ramsha, child. All of this happening
 by planning and this accident was also part of
 the plan, it was part of it. Have you lost your mind? I had told you there 
is nothing like that, go from here. Lower your voice. This is my home, not yours.
 Do you understand. And I will never let this plan of 
yours to destroy me be successful. Hey you even used 
your mother to get me. I have not seen anyone 
cheap like you. You are cheap, not me. You must have used your 
parents to your advantage, I didn’t. Why are you so worried, Afnan? Hey, why would I not get worried? Are you and I separate? If you get disturbed, then I will also be disturbed. Come on, Afnan, I feel you have given way too
 much importance to that girl. Yes. Nothing had happened. I feel all of us are thinking too much Really? Are you telling the truth? Yes, child. The reports are much better. See, the doctor whatsapped 
them to me. Thank God. Thank God. This is a really good news uncle. Hey, Afnan, why are you standing there? Greetings dad. Greetings. Are you going to your room? Yes, dad. Do one thing, order sweets. Ramsha’s mother’s medical
 reports are really good. Dad, I am really sorry. I am really tired. I will ask Bashir, he will get it. Yes, fine. Fine, then I will go offer nawafil of thankfulness. You will pray, right now? Yes, the best way to 
thank God is prayers. You spend something in God’s way, you offer nawafil. You know, God says that He doesn’t like those 
who are thankless, and He says in the
 Holy Quran, that you be thankful to Me, so that I can give you more. So if we want that God gives us more,
 blesses us more, we should be thankful to him too, right? May God make us from amongst
 those who are thankful to him. Okay, live long. Oh God, thank you. What are you doing, Afnan? What are you doing? I am packing your bags,
 you are leaving from here. I will not go anywhere from here. You leave from here. Do you not understand? I said leave from here. I think I will have to go
 tell uncle everything. One minute. One minute.
 One minute. What did you say? Uncle. Who are you calling uncle? My dad is your…. No, he is just my dad, you have no relation with him, so stop forming relations. Understand? I don’t want to argue with you, you can leave from here. I will not leave. You are the one who will leave. Not just from this room in fact,
 from this home. Look, Ramsha, we have already 
had a lot of drama between us. Right now, 
everyone is sleeping. It is a good opportunity, leave from her quietly, no drama will be created. I have told you, I will not leave. Don’t you understand? I think you will not 
understand like this. If you misbehave 
with me after this, then I will go and tell uncle
 everything about our relationship. You are threatening me? You are threatening me? Leave my hand. I wont leave it. I said, leave my hand. I have cried enough because of you, now not anymore. Your father brought me here. I didn’t come by my will and when he asks me, I will leave from this home, at that moment. But I will not even move with you asking me. So, it would be better leave from here. Once again. Once again, my thinking about
 you turned out to be wrong. You know for a second, seeing this getup of yours, I thought you have changed. But no. You are still the same person. The same stubborn person 
who doesn’t agree easily. Yes, that’s how it is. So it would be better that you leave from here. I will leave, but hear one thing clearly. The intentions you came
 with in this home, I will not let them be successful. This is my promise to you. Mama, our life was so good. You, papa, me, we were all so happy. Me and Annie would 
sit for hours and talk. You and aunt would always scold us. The restrictions of you and aunt, the mischief of me and Annie. It was such a good time, mama. It all got ruined. The time was so good, it all ended because of me. First, papa. Papa left me and went. After that all the relations ended. And now you. You are in the mouth of 
death because of me. This world of mobile and social 
media has ruined me, mama. This fake world left
 me with nothing. I don’t know mama, how many girls like me 
are in this world of deceit. They have reached to the point, where there is only destruction. I am already ruined, I don’t know how many other girls
 like me are there who are walking on this path of lies. I wish the girls can see 
me and learn a lesson, and they stop before they 
walk on this path to destruction. I don’t know mama, till when and for how long will I have
 to suffer the punishment of this mistake. You get fine, mama. I need you. Get fine soon, mama. Get fine soon. Annie. Yes, papa? Come here. Give me Ramsha’s number. I have the same number for 
her that I had earlier. No child, I am not talking about that number. I am talking about the number that she is using nowadays. Give me that number. In fact, do one thing, why give me the number, child, you dial that number for me. I have no contact with elder
 mama and Ramsha. I have the same number 
that you have. Annie, Ramsha was your best friend and I am sure that you and your mother have helped sister in law and Ramsha to runaway from here. How is it possible that you help them, and they reach somewhere and reaching there you are 
not in contact with them. You can make me swear, papa. I have no contact with them. I didn’t talk to him. Annie, don’t lie to me. You are lying the same
 way your mother is lying. Look child, I give you surety, believe me, she is my niece. Believe me, I will not harm them. You just give me their contact number. Tell me, where did sister in law
run taking Ramsha. I am telling you the truth, papa, I didn’t contact them at all. If you don’t believe me, I will bring my mobile. You can check my mobile. Annie… Annie, go from here. What is wrong with you? Why are you questioning 
the child like this? When we have told you once that we don’t know anything about
 sister in law and Ramsha, then why don’t you believe us. Forget them, and live your life peacefully and let us live peacefully too. We are tired of these 
daily arguments. Don’t forget Salma, if you want that peace
 returns to your home, then give me the location 
of Ramsha and sister in law. Don’t forget, neither will I live peacefully myself and nor will I let you 
people live peacefully. Now Ramsha and sister in law are my stubbornness. My stubbornness. Congratulations. Are you congratulating 
me with your heart? No, I am not a hypocrite like you that I lie and deceive people. How did I deceive you? We were friends for so long, you spoke with me for so long and you didn’t even tell me 
once that you are engaged. If this isn’t deceit, 
then what is it, Afnan? Look, I didn’t want to talk to you, but since you are talking
 to me calmly, then I will answer this too. First, when I met you
 I was not engaged. Yes, I got engaged 
after meeting you. But think yourself, what was between the two of us that I would have shared things
 of my personal life with you? It was not my responsibility to tell 
you everything about my personal life. It was not even your 
responsibility to be my friend. It was not your responsibility 
to talk to me, either. Then, you still did it. I am not answerable to you
 for everything. Because you are a liar, that is why are you saying this. When a person is not clear themselves, that’s when they say this. Accept this, that you are a cheater. Just shut up. How is this possible dad, that the girl has no relative 
or acquaintance in this city? I think she is lying. How can you say she is lying? Do you know that girl? Me? How would I know? That’s the thing. Then how can you say with so 
much conviction that she is lying. And what do you want? I listen to you and drag 
that girl out of this home? No dad, I was  just saying… I am saying that I brought this girl to my home
 on my responsibility. Till her mother doesn’t 
regain complete health, she will live here, 
she is my responsibility. If I am not sincere about 
my responsibility, then how am I responsible? You too think about it. Tabassum. Yes, madam? How long have you 
been working here? I have been working for a long time. First my grandma worked here, then my mama and now I am doing it.
 I had told you. I remember. So if you have been
 here for some time, then you must also have 
been there in the engagement of 
Mr. Afnan and Alizay. It has not been long, it has just been a few months. In fact, it has not even been a year. Elder sir is going to get Mr. Afnan 
and Alizay married soon. Okay, it has not been long. Come here, have a seat. No, I will sit on the floor. NO, no, sit here. No, I am fine. Go ahead. Alizay is the only niece of uncle, so that is why he is marrying 
her to his only son. No madam Alizay is not 
Mr. Qasim’s choice, she is Mr. Afnan’s choice. Shahida told me, Mr. Afnan loves Miss 
Alizay since childhood. It is their love marriage. Even Mr. Qasim didn’t 
object because of his sister. Now you can say that the love marriage has been 
changed to an arranged marriage. Yes, but they are not married yet. I mean, if they are not married yet,
 so love or arranged, what are you saying 
again and again? Madam Ramsha, the wedding didn’t take
 place yet, but it will. Will you tell me something? Like Mr. Afnan loves Alizay, does Alizay love her the same 
or is it one sided love? Mr. Afnan is so good, why wouldn’t madam 
Alizay like him? What does litte master lack? He has such good manner, such a big home, such a good family, what more does a girl want? Mr. Afnan dies for madam Alizay. Fine, you go. I am here. Everything will be fine. What sort of a girl are you? You are talking 
even in this situation. Thank you, Afnan. 
Thank you so much. I don’t know what
 I would have done had you not come. 
Those people were going to do 
something bad with me. Ramsha, how could I not come? It was you, I had to come for you
 in every condition. And I know well you 
didn’t do anything, you are being framed in this matter. But I am with you, Ramsha, I will not leave you alone
 in this tough time. No madam Alizay is not 
Mr. Qasim’s choice, she is Mr. Afnan’s choice. Shahida told me, Mr. Afnan loves Miss 
Alizay since childhood. It is their love marriage. Mr. Afnan is so good, why wouldn’t madam Alizay like him? But don’t worry, I will talk to Mr. Ahmad in this matter, and I will sort this matter out. Okay, you removed my worry. But I will still visit Mr. Ahmad on 
my way back from the mosque. Yes, fine. Greetings, uncle. Greetings. Uncle, I wanted you to do something. Yes, go ahead, child. I took the number for
 Dr. Safdar from the nurse. Can I take your phone?
 I will call and return the phone. I had to talk about something 
related to mama. Yes. Don’t you have a phone? It is surprising, in today’s time, the girl doesn’t have a phone. Look at the girl’s simplicity, she doesn’t have a phone. I am seeing dad, and I am also thinking, where do you find such girls? At least, no such girl is in our circle. You don’t worry. Afnan, do one thing, let Ramsha talk on the phone and when you come 
back from the office, then bring a good phone 
for her and give it to her. Okay child? You will get to talk. I will go now. May God protect you. You know, there is something you
 know well how to fool people. You even convinced dad,
 how innocent you are. Here you go. Give it back. You cannot use a phone 
without unlocking it, have you even forgotten that? Hey, where are you 
taking my phone? I will not run away with your phone, I will make a call and return it. Fine, I will try to talk to Alizay. No, no, you don’t have to talk to her, 
you have to make her agree. Look aunt, I am planning to go to
 Dubai next month and I don’t know how long 
it will take to set the business. So it would be better that you talk to Alizay about this. Will brother agree? I will convince him, you don’t worry about him, but you will have to convince Alizay. Fine, then I will talk to Alizay. No aunt, you will have to tell him that once I go to Dubai, then I will get  busy. Then if it takes a year or two years, it will be difficult to return before that, so whatever happens 
will be done after that. Pray that whatever I talk to her about,
 she understands. If you make her understand like
 this, then she will understand. Okay, I will go. Goodbye. Goodbye.
