Thank you. Have tea, sir is coming. Thank you. Greetings. Greetings. How are you? Good, thank you so much. Tell me if you have anything lacking,
difference in quality or if you have any complaint,
then do tell me. Hey, no, no,
what are you saying, Sajid? The quality of everything is good. In fact, I am surprised that you added a couple of more
things in the grocery. It is good, it will be more convenient for them. May God bless you and increase
your business further. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have a friend, Mr. Hamid Baig. You must have heard the name
of Hamid Chemical. He has a big company. He is from amongst those that
spend in what God gave him. He arrange groceries. So I gave him your number, it is possible he might contact you. Thank you very much, Mr. Sajid. Because of you, my business
has increased a lot. May God always keep us thankful to him. He makes it happen. He creates the means and everything. I also wanted to apologize to you that you had to come yourself
to get the cheque. Actually, I had made it my son Afnan
responsible for your payment, he has gone to Islamabad for some work. It is God’s good, and he is the only son, so he has a lot of
responsibilities on him. May God give him life. No issues, it is work, it happens. There is a boy on your shop, what is his name? Shani. Is he your son? No, he is not my son. He is my brother Anwar’s son,
he is my nephew. Okay. Okay. So how many children
do you have? Ramsha. Here you go, your light. You brought it. You are so good, thank you. Hey, if my daughter makes a wish and I don’t fulfill it.
How is that possible? Thank you, papa. What was the need to bring this? You fulfill every insistence of hers. This love and affection of
yours has spoiled her. ‘We have one daughter, wife of mine. If I don’t take care of her wishes, then will we care for the
wishes of the neighbours. Our daughter has achieved a great feat, so the whole city should know about it. Sajid, don’t say that. Ramsha is our daughter. She was. She isn’t anymore. She has no relation
with us or this home. I have no child. I am childless. It is God’s will. The nephew and nieces
are like your children. Did you not have tea? No, I have given time to someone. Hey, not like that. I will go now. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. Ramsha. Ramsha. Hey, I brought soup for you. Move this from here. Mama, I had told you
I don’t want to have soup. I don’t want to drink soup. Why don’t you want to have it, child? You are not well.
You have not eaten anything, . This way you will get unwell further. Drink some soup, then
I will bring medication for you. Come on. Mama, I don’t want to have medication, nor do I want to drink anything, nor eat anything, you leave, let me sleep
for some time please. Hey, how is that possible? Did you see? She is not eating anything,
nor drinking anything. Hey, if she eats something,
then I will give her medication. Make her understand. Child, your mother is right, if you don’t eat anything, then
how will you get better? Come on, have soup. I had told mama that
I don’t want to have soup, still she brought it. If you don’t want to have soup,
then what will my daughter eat? Zinger burger. Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare, get her
a zinger burger. She is in this condition
having food from outside. She will just have soup. Yes, you are absolutely right, Kulsoom. Child, you have the soup
and while you drink it, I will quietly bring you a burger. Okay? What? What? What are the father and
daughter talking about? No, nothing. You leave it. I will give soup to my daughter
with my own hands. You leave. Leave. I am bringing her medication. Have it slowly. Come on. Have it, yourself. Come on. It is so delicious. That’s it… Drink it. Drink it. Where is your mobile? I don’t know, it is kept here somewhere. I want to have a zinger burger, not this. I am ordering it for my daughter. Okay, drink it. I will just order it. Papa and mama might not talk to me, I will try calling Annie. j Hello. Hello. Hello, who is it? Speak up. Who was calling you? What would I know? You answered the phone,
you would know. Yes, so I received the call and
said hello, no one answered. Tell me honestly, who was it? I am surprised mama, my phone is with you all day long
and still you are doubting me. Ramsha ran away from the home and my life has become hell. Are you people doing right with me? Mama, there is a limit to everything, for God’s sake, stop doubting me. She talks nonsense for no reason. Sister in law if you want something,
then tell me. I am working in the kitchen. No Salma, you work in the kitchen all day long. I came to make tea. My Ramsha is not there anymore. Sister in law, get a grip on yourself. How long will you stay worried like this? How do I get a grip? She was part of my existence. I cannot cut her and throw her away. I can understand your sorrow. I too am the mother a daughter. You have no idea. You cannot have an idea,
you can never understand. Your daughter knew everything, but she didn’t tell us anything. I don’t know where that damned
girl would be right now. What condition would she be in? Sister in law, I asked Annie a lot. If she knew anything,
she would have surely told me. You know, someone called twice
on your home number, but no one spoke. What if, it was my Ramsha who called? Oh God, you keep my daughter in
your protection, my lord. Amen. You go ahead, I will make tea and give it to you. Go. Oh God, my head. Oh. Hania. Hania. Hania. Oh. Oh. Hania. Hania. Hania, is not at home. Oh, my head. My phone. Yes, Ramsha, go ahead. Afnan, I have a really bad headache. I have high fever. I feel my head will explode. Hey, why are you crying?
What happened to you? Are you okay? I don’t know Afnan. I don’t understand anything. My head is hurting really badly. I don’t have the strength to get up
and go to the hospital. Okay relax. Don’t worry. Where is your friend?
Make her talk to me. She is not at home. I am dying. My head is hurting badly, no one is at home. Hello. Ramsha. Ramsha. Ramsha,
what happened? Hello. Afnan. How are you feeling now? You brought me here? No, no, I came to visit you. Of course I brought you here. And had I not come there, you know what would have
happened with you? You were lying unconscious, and your friend had left
you alone and gone. What? Why are you laughing now? I am thinking. Whenever I call you in trouble,
you always come. The problem is you get
stuck in difficulties a lot. Will you agree to something? Yes? Go back to your home. Your family must be worried. And see yourself, you were alone here, what could have happened to you? Think yourself. You were so unwell. You were completely alone. Even your friend was
not there with you. God forbid, if something
had happened, then? What would the family have done? They too would have brought
me to the hospital. So you brought me. Man… you know what your biggest problem is? You don’t understand. Okay, don’t scold me. I am really unwell and then you are scolding me. Hey, I am not scolding you. Hey, listen, you call and ask
a friend to come to you. I have a really important meeting. I was going there, I got a call from you, so I came to you. But now I have to leave. Okay, don’t worry. Leave. As soon as the drip ends,
I too will leave. You have supported me so much,
this is enough for me. You please, go. I will tell the hospital staff to come check
on you again and again. Okay? And will you be able to manage alone? Yes, you go without worrying. You wont get into any
other problem, right? If I get caught, you are here. You wont learn. Okay, I will go now. Bye. Bye. Oh hi. How are you feeling now? You came with Danish Kamal? Yes, why? But why, Hania? I have signed a project with him. But why, Hania? Don’t you know his nature? Ramsha, he has offered me
a handsome amount. He wont give you anything. He only talks, dramas, he only lies. Ramsha, listen to me. Look, he has already transferred
one million in my account, which is my advance payment. You will do anything for money, Hania? What do you mean I will do anything? I am not marrying him. Buddy, I just signed a project with him, I am not making him my boyfriend, and see, nowadays, I needed a handsome amount nowadays, that is why I signed this project. Okay. Okay,. I will tell you everything. Vicky and I are planning to
settle in Europe. Now who is this Vicky? I have to tell you everything clearly, that who is Vicky. Vicky is my boyfriend, so we have planned that we will settle in Europe after marriage. Look, he doesn’t need money, and he doesn’t have any such issue, but his parents are not agreeing for our marriage, so we had to do this planning. Okay leave all this, listen to me. I am sending you a number and along with it,
I am sending you a location. You go there, there are two
scenes, get them shot. Then you will see, you will get good work in future too. Yes, but right now, I am not that well… Look, if you don’t get well now, then the future will be spoiled too. Go right now, do this work, then you can see. You will become a shining star and I believe in you. Okay? Oh, you come inside with me. I will explain everything to you.
I will remove all your confusion. Mama, I spoke to Afnan. He was saying he shopped for me. I got worried hearing it. Hey, what is there to be worried in this? This is something to be happy about. You know, Afnan cannot shop. He will bring whatever he gets his hands on. That is so bad. He is bringing so many things
for you with so much love, now you don’t make a face, or he will be really sad. I am saying something to you. I don’t know, mama. Just do what I have told you. By the way, you are really worried about your nephew. Why shouldn’t I be worried? Hey, he is my only and beloved nephew. After all, he is my future son in law too. That’s how it is going on. Yes. No. No. No. Vicky, I will talk to you in a bit. Yes, yes, okay. Okay. I have been calling you for so long, Hania, your number is busy for the
past two hours. What happened? I was busy with Vicky on the phone, and why were you calling me? You know, Hania, I have been standing on
bus stop for two hours, there was no bus or taxi. And the two cars on the
shoot were also busy, they just sent me away like that. You didn’t call me in
so long that if I am fine, alive, am I fine or not? Come on, Ramsha, I am not your mother that
I worry for you. I have a lot of things keeping
me busy as well. You are right. You are not my mother that
you will worry for me. Mothers worry. If I used to get a little late
from university, then my mother would
wait for me on the door. Okay, listen to me. You shouldn’t have left the
shoot so soon. You should have ordered an online taxi. The online taxi made me go aimlessly. I couldn’t find a taxi, and then on top of that I had a
fight with the manager as well. Ramsha, how many times have I told you, you are new in the field. You will have to adjust to everything, you will have to tolerate it all. Hey Hania, how much more do I adjust? They give no sort of facility, they give such little money, listen to everything,
do all kinds of character, how else do I adjust. I have to tolerate so much
even not wanting to. You are right. But you will see, that time will come soon, when you wont tolerate people,
people will tolerate you. Okay? I don’t know. I don’t know when that time will come. Hey listen to me. Ramsha. Ramsha. Annie.. You still haven’t gone to
sleep elder mama? Child, I am unable to sleep. I feel really restless. You are awake till now. What are you doing? I have to submit the
assignment tomorrow, so I am completing that. Annie, do people ask about
Ramsha in the university? Elder mama, in the start everyone asked. I told everyone Ramsha
has gone to Nawabshah, now no one asks. And after all, with time, people don’t
remember anything, they all get busy in their lives. You are right. With time, people forget everything. It is a mother who is unable
to forget her child, ever. Annie, child, Do you know anything about that boy
you mentioned was in the university? I mean, if you have his phone number, then please give it to me. I will not mention anything to anyone, child. I don’t know who he is, where he lives, I don’t know anything. Have you ever seen that boy? I don’t know what is the problem.
Hania should have taken the keys, she is ringing the bell for no reason. I am coming. Hania, why didn’t you take your keys… You? Yes, me. Hania is not at home, you leave… I know Hania is not there. You come on. Come. I am telling you Hania is not at home, don’t you understand? Hey, I know, I know Hania is not at home. I spoke to her. Answer me one thing, you consider anyone’s home
your own and give orders? I really like this innocence of yours. Look, listen to me, leave from here. Why are you bothering me? Hey, listen to me. Tell me something. Why did you leave my
big palace like home and come to this flat? What is the matter, baby? I think you have gotten
used to running away. Look, this habit is not good. You leave from here,
when Hania comes… Listen to me. Leave me. Listen to me for a minute. No. Where did he come from? Open the door. Please open the door. What is the issue with you? Why are you not going from here? Hey, listen to me. I don’t want to meet you. Open the door for a minute, I have to talk to you about
something really important. What do I do? Hania… Hello. Yes, Ramsha, go ahead. Hello, Hania, where are you? What time will you come? How long will you take to come home? Where are you right now?
 You know that Danish is outside our home. 
He is here. I am alone, Hania. I am going to reach in a while. I asked him to wait for me. Hania, you should have called
 him in your presence. You know what sort of a man he is. 
I am alone at home. How long will you take to come home? Ramsha, you are worried for no reason. He is my guest, he will not 
say anything to you. Okay listen, if you are so scared, then lock the room from 
inside and sit. Okay? I have locked the door, Hania. Yes, so what is there to
 be scared in this? He is not a ghost that he will 
come inside from a closed door. You don’t worry,
 I am reaching in a while. Okay? I am coming. Okay. Okay, bye. What is the problem? 
Why are you not leaving? Why don’t you leave me alone? Please open the door, I have to talk to you about
 something important. Don’t bother me. Leave from here. Hania is coming,
 don’t bother me. Please. We can talk, right? Till Hania doesn’t come,
 sit and talk to me. I have to talk about something
 important to you. Open the door, listen to me. Hania, answer your phone. Hania. Greetings. Greetings. Why did you take so long 
to come from work? Did you have a lot of work? No, brother was not well. I took him to the hospital. God be kind, what happened?
 Where is brother? I have made him lie in the room. His blood pressure shot up and why wouldn’t it shoot up, when he got such a big tension 
in this age. Someone has said it correctly, there can be no greater test for parents than the
 disobedience of children. I don’t understand why do we let it reach this point? If the children are disobedient, then the children are not the 
only ones to blame, the parents should be
 blamed equally. Now see, I have told sister
 in law so many times not to give Ramsha such freedom. What do you mean? What do you want to say? You lean to say that us parents 
keep the children caged? Hmm It is also the responsibility
 of the children. If us parents give them freedom, then it is their responsibility 
to take care of the freedom and not to take undue advantage of it. Yes, you are right. But there is a big difference 
between freedom and disobedience. When did I say you 
cage your children at home? Or you don’t let them 
get out of the home. I just say that at least the parents should be this strict that the parents and children can be saved from any test. Hey our grand parents 
were really lucky that they used to stop us on everything and we also used to accept it. But the parents of today? They cannot say anything to
 their children on their mistake. Not children, but the parents
 are scared of their children getting upset. You are absolutely right. Really, we are really unlucky. Anyway, can you give me something to eat? Okay, I will just bring it. Hania, please come home soon. See, I knew he would come. Who is it? Oh. You? Where is he? Where is he? What are you doing, Ramsha? What is wrong with you? When did you come?
 Where is that Danish Kamal? Where did he go? What Danish Kamal? If you come out then you
 will find out something. You are scared like if you had come out, 
he would have eaten you. Danish Kamal… Quiet. I have been knocking on 
the door for so long, I am calling you, but you don’t hear me. That is why I had to open
 the door the other way out of helplessness. Okay, come on, keep this first. Come here. Sit here. What happened to you? You were never so scared earlier, what has happened to you now? Earlier, mama and papa 
were there with me everywhere to protect me. Now I am alone, I have to protect myself. I have to save myself 
from bad people, and you know what 
sort of a man he is. With what difficulty 
I have saved myself from him I know all this. No matter how many friends
 you have on the outside, no matter how many people, you feel alone without family. But, you don’t worry, I am with you. Come here. I will make one more Tik Tok, 
then I will go and change. Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare. And don’t even look at the 
clothes that come for stictching for me. But you never listen to me. You are always engrossed 
in making the video. I am going after
 making one video. That’s it. I am going. This is the same Ramsha, she grew up in front of our eyes. I remember the day in the hospital, when the nurse gave 
a doll in my hands and said sir, you had a daughter. And I thanked God, that God thank you, you gave us a blessing in our home Hey, you should ask me, who tolerated her every single day. Your daughter has grown
 up with a lot of difficulty. Do you see? Do you hear that? She tolerates me daily. It is good you heard it yourself. hey, no child, your mother 
really loves you, she is joking. I know, mama loves me the most.
