What happened Afnan? You cannot sleep? You worry about Ramsha so much 
that you cannot even sleep Yes, I am worried about Ramsha but please don’t overthink about it… A person worries about someone, with whom he has a relation! That is not necessary, a person worries about someone 
with whom he is sincere with and wants the best for him as well! Leave it, Afnan! I know very well what your heart 
must be feeling, you cannot tolerate that 
Ramsha is leaving the house! Imagine you fought with uncle 
for Ramsha. you never fought with your father 
for me Afnan! Why are you silent? Speak! I am silent because I don’t want to fight 
with you at this hour of the night, it would be best if you let me be and without arguing go back to sleep. Actually, Mr. Qasim, I am really ashamed! Believe me, I scolded him a lot that day… How dare he came here and talk to you
 in such a manner? I decided that day that 
as soon as I get free, I will bring Shani to you and I will make him ask 
for your forgiveness… There is no need for that. How is it not needed, Mr. Qasim? You are a good man, 
you forgave Shani’s mistake, if it were someone else then 
they would have called the police! Come, apologize to Mr. Qasim! I said it is fine! What am I saying? Elders do say this, but still, get up and apologize! Mr. Qasim, forgive me for that day, I was a bit angry! Child, like I said, it is fine… It is your greatness that you realized your child’s mistake otherwise today’s parents just try 
to hide their children's mistakes. Yes, you are absolutely right! Oh, Salma, you should talk about what is 
in your heart with Mr. Qasim… Mr. Qasim, actually, Salma wanted to request, that since sister-in-law and 
Ramsha left our home, we have lost the happiness 
of our home so Salma wants to take Ramsha, 
the joy of her house back home. Yes, Brother Qasim, we have come here for Ramsha’s proposal
for our Shani, if you find it okay, we would like for you
to talk to Ramsha about it… If you guys came here for this purpose, then I think you guys are 
wasting your time. Actually, don’t worry, we will... answer you once we think about it Yes, yes, of course, 
By the grace of God… The tea is getting cold, 
have some! Ramsha! Congratulations, what happened? Why are you looking at me like this? Don't you know? Why? What happened? I really don’t know. You really don’t know? Your proposal has come from 
your relatives. your uncle and aunt’s son, his proposal has come for you… isn’t it great news? I am so happy for you! What happened? 
Why do you look so sad? Smile, look you already had to 
leave this house, isn’t it better that you are being 
wedded off from this house, hmm? Okay listen, I came to know that your wedding 
was called off before all this as well… it’s a good thing you are getting 
married this time, you should be thankful, by God’s grace, and start your preparations! Brother, I think this is a very 
suitable proposal. Afsheen, I don’t like that boy! The guy who doesn’t know 
how to speak to his elders, doesn’t have basic ethics, 
what shall one say about him? What is the saying, first impression 
is the last impression, he is an ill-mannered and ill-spoken boy. Brother, whatever he did, 
he did it in anger! You know about today’s generation, they are extremely emotionally reactive
 and he apologized to you as well! No Afsheen, my heart is not
satisfied for that boy… Brother, look, Ramsha has been brought up 
in that house, and her aunt loves her a lot. look, she can get a mother 
in the form of her aunt! And a house in the name of in-laws. what more would Ramsha want? What could be better for 
Ramsha than this? Look brother, we also shouldn’t forget 
the fact that Ramsha had a past, I mean, look, her video went viral 
around the world. Brother, look, honourable people don’t like 
such things! Look, if you are thinking that Ramsha will get an extraordinary 
proposal then that is impossible brother! If you delay regarding Ramsha’s matter 
then brother, it will be unjust to my Alizeh. whatever it is Afsheen, I can’t take any decision without asking 
Ramsha about her opinion and her intentions. God has permitted this in our religion! The girl’s proposal cannot be done 
without her willingness and she will always have this right! Where are you going? I am going to talk to Uncle. Brother is sleeping, what do you want to talk about? What do you think, if you won’t let me then 
I won’t come to know about it? Do you have any idea about how brother 
is depressed because of you? First, you destroyed Afnan 
and Alizeh’s relationship and now you are making a son 
fight with his father? No, I never listened to Afnan before nor will I listen to him in the future! I just wanted to tell Uncle that 
I am ready to go back into that house. That would be such a huge favour 
on us from you! What do you think, that if you left this house, will Afnan get rid of you from his heart and will he be able to forget about you? Will you lose your connection 
with this house? I have told this to Alizeh many times and I am telling you as well, there is nothing between me 
and Afnan now. I have forgotten my past and 
moved on in my life! If you have forgotten your past, does this mean that people will forget 
your past as well? Your videos and those pictures of yours 
are just a click away from people! The disgusting videos and pictures 
you have uploaded, haven’t left the minds of men yet, girls like you are not given respect, and I am surprised about how brother has still accepted
 you as his daughter! Do you have any idea about how many favours brother has done
 on you and your mother? And what have you given him in return, 
depression? Separation from his son? Look, woman, if you are even a little bit sincere 
with brother then get married to your cousin and leave this house forever and never come back here again! Leave! Father, shall I say something? Hmm… Mr. Qasim will not agree, Say something nice for once! What nice thing shall I say? Were you not watching, he was looking 
at me as if he wanted to slap me! Have you seen your behaviour? You deserve this. Whatever it is, we shouldn’t have 
gone there. What has happened? Afsheen Ma’am said it herself that she will do something for you. and it was right in front of you, she said that they would think 
and give a reply. if they wanted to refuse, then 
they would have done it there only! Father, don’t you think there is some benefit for 
Afsheen Ma’am in it? What has happened to you? Have you gone mad? What benefit will Afsheen Ma’am 
get from your marriage? What are you saying? Father, things have changed nowadays, nobody helps anyone until 
they get something out of it too. It is a simple thing, Afsheen Ma’am doesn’t want Ramsha 
to stay in her house, she wants Mr. Qasim and herself 
to get done with Ramsha’s responsibility! And who will tolerate a stranger girl 
in their home for this long? No father, there is something else. To hell with what you think! I know one thing, son, that the day you and Ramsha 
will get married, that day this house and that shop, will become ours, ours! and whatever Mr. Qasim will give 
will be added as well. it is a clear matter, son, if Brother Sajid would have been alive even then he would have been unable 
to give what Mr. Qasim will give! They are people of status! They call Ramsha, their daughter, now they will not wed her off
 empty handed. what do you think? Now I am about to drink my tea, let me drink my tea in peace, don’t say anything in between! Brother, Ramsha’s aunt is calling 
again and again… what shall I tell her? Aunt, there is no need to give an answer,
 just say no… Afnan, Mom is asking Uncle,
not you! And I am not talking to you 
but with Aunt! Brother, I think we should accept it. there is good and bad in every person, By God’s grace, 
Ramsha is intelligent enough, and I believe that after marriage, 
she will be able to change that boy! And we have seen so many marriages where boys are irresponsible before 
marriage but after marriage, boys do change themselves! Whatever it is Afsheen! I don’t want to take any decision
 without talking to Ramsha. Let me talk to her first. Uncle… I accept this proposal. Ramsha, child, tell me honestly, did anyone force you to say yes? No, no one forced me… I have accepted this proposal by heart, you can call Uncle and Aunt 
and say “yes” to them. I am getting late for Academy,
I am going, goodbye! May God keep you safe. Uhm, excuse me. Whatever I am asking you, 
answer me honestly, was it Aunt or Alizeh who forced you 
to accept Shani’s proposal? Now don’t lie to me, you can lie to the entire world 
but not me. Nobody forced me. You are lying to me, swear to me that you are not lying! Why shall I swear? Do you even believe when I swear? I swore to love you and 
be faithful to you, you never believed me then, so 
why are you asking me to swear today? Don’t punish yourself for 
my mistakes Ramsha. Look Afnan, you are living your life just like 
you wanted to live. Let me live my life the way 
I want to live as well. Stay away from me!
