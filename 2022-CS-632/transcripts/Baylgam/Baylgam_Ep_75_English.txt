Are you leaving? Yes. Obviously. Now this is not my mother’s home, that I can live here. People are right, the parents’ home is the one where the parents are alive. And now this is no longer
my in-laws home, so I will have to go. How long can I stay at
the home of relatives? Ramsha. Don’t worry. You know, whether I live in this
home or not, I will surely live in your heart. I had thought that after your
marriage with brother, we would always live together. I didn’t know all this would happen. I wish I could do something you child. All that you have done for
me after mama left, is enough, aunt. Child, if you go to Mr. Qasim’s home, then I will be satisfied. No aunt, I don’t want to go back to his home and become a burden on him again. I will live alone. I will stand up on my feet myself. How do you make such big
decisions, child? When everything is impossible
in a person’s life, then it is easy to make
difficult decisions. May God always make you have
this strength and courage. I pray that you always get success
and happiness. Amen. Come here. Ramsha, child, I couldn’t do anything else for you, just keep this. No aunt. I don’t want money. I don’t want to live on anyone
else’s support. How long will I take support
from everyone? Whatever I have to do,
I will do it for myself. I will stand up on my feet. Just remember me
in your prayers. You will come to meet us,
right? No. I will never come back to
this home again. But… but if you want to meet me, then you can come. I will give you my address. Aunt, I will give you, your address, you come with Annie to meet me. Yes, child. Why not? Oh God. Mama, I was just going to change. The video has been made. You know, I have gone crazy searching
for this suit. And damn this video of yours. This passion of yours has
made me go mad. I pray to God that you don’t get
a single like on this video. Fear God. I have dressed up so much and I wont get any likes on Tik Tok. Mama, don’t say that.
Take back your curse, mama. With whose permission
did you put on this suit? If you would have put
a small stain on it, then Tabassum would have
become really upset. And if she finds out
that you wore it, then all hell will break loose. Who will tell her? Who will tell her? No one, right. And you don’t worry so much, she wont find out. I wore it for ten minutes,
it did wear out. I will make another Tik Tok, then I will go change… Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare. Hey, child, your mother is right. If you don’t eat anything, then how will you get fine? Huh? Drink the soup quickly.
Come on. I had told mama I don’t want to drink soup, still she prepared it
and brought it. If you don’t want to have soup, then what will my daughter have? Zinger burger. Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare feed her
a zinger burger. She is in this condition because
of eating food from outside. She will just have soup. Yes, Kulsoom is absolutely right. You do one thing,
you have this soup, child a nd as you drink it,
I will quietly bring you the burger. Okay? What? What? What are you father
and daughter… No, nothing. You leave. You leave it. I will feed my daughter
the soup with my own hands. You, go. Hey my parents chose
your father for me. I didn’t even see him before marriage. Oh man. If you had seen him before marriage, then you wouldn’t have had to
go through all this today. Ramsha.. I mean, mama, every girl wishes that she gets a good and
handsome boy. Now, no one selects
someone with a belly. Look at Papa. Your father was not like
this since the start, and neither did he have a belly. Your father was really handsome
before marriage. Uh-huh, handsome, huh? Mehnaz, this is the same Ramsha, right? She grew up so quickly. I remember the day the nurse put
a doll in my arms in the hospital, and said that sir,
you had a daughter and I thanked God, that God, thank You, you sent blessings in our home. Hey, you ask me who has tolerated her
every single day. Your daughter has grown
up after difficulty. Do you see that? Do you hear her? She tolerates me daily. It is good you heard it yourself today. No, no, child, your mother really loves you. She is just joking. I know that. Mama loves me the most. Yes, papa, I am coming. Here you go, your light. You brought it! You are so good. Thank you. How is it possible that my daughter
makes a wish and I don’t fulfill it. Thank you, papa. What was the need to bring this? You fulfill all her wishes. This love and affection of
yours has spoiled her. I have one daughter, madam, if I don’t care for her wishes, then would I care about the
wishes of the neighbours? Why are you looking at me like this? Do you want something? I am seeing daughters are so good. You bring food for me daily
early in the morning. You care for me all day long. You don’t frown even once. You are the same one to whom I would ask to do something, you would get upset. But now, you seem so smart. Annie, make tea for Shani. When he wakes up,
he will immediately want tea. Mama, you and papa are serving
brother so well like he fought a battle and came. First, he did what he wanted, then he wasted all the money
and came back. Hey, he got cheated. He said his friends cheated him. He didn’t know this
would happen with him. Now if he is going through
bad times, if the family doesn’t support him,
then who will? Even Ramsha was going
through bad times, right? Then why did you drag her out? Annie, there is no point
of this argument now. She mourning had ended, she had to leave this home one day. She had to leave mama. She surely had to go. But not the way you people
dragged her out of this home. Okay, you make tea. I will go see who it is.
You go and make tea. Yes, are you fine? I was missing Ramsha, so I thought I would meet her. You inform her that I have come. That’s it. Stop here. That’s it, brother. Thank you. Here is your money. Why are they not opening the door? Hello. Yes, Anum, I am outside your home, open the door. Ramsha, I am in the car right now and I am going to Mirpur. Mama called in the morning, papa is really unwell. He had a heart attack, and I am sorry, I forgot to inform you. I left in a haste. Oh no, may God have mercy. I was standing outside your home, now where will I go, Anum? Sorry Ramsha, but please, you make some
other arrangement. I am really worried right now, I will talk to you later. Anum, I…right now…hello? You should have at least informed. You should have called me, I would have come to get her. How can you be so careless
in the matters of a girl? I wanted to call you and inform you, but Ramsha strictly told me not to.
What could I do? You didn’t do what
you should have done. I was helpless. You are not helpless,
this is your selfishness. Tell me, if your own daughter
was in Ramsha’s place, then would you have done this? A lonely girl and this society. You have an idea how many
animals exist in this society. Today, if I tell you to hand your daughter
over to this society, then would you do this? Dad, leave it. There is no need to say
so much to these people. If they cared about Ramsha, they wouldn’t have let her go alone. I will call her. We will find out where she is. She is not answering her call. Look, whatever friend she went to, you must have her number, some home address. Please tell us that. At least, we will be satisfied that
 Ramsha is fine. Annie knows. She has the number. I will find out. Please, quickly. This is the limit to being careless. Meaning, had we not come here like this, then we would not have found out. Dad, relax. Please. Greetings. Find out who this girl is. Why is she sitting here? Yes, I will ask her. Madam, why are you sitting here? Who do you want to meet? Are you not ashamed? You are begging wearing
such good clothes. I am not a beggar. I know girls like you well. You wear good clothes, you hold a good bag, you cry about your poverty
and helplessness and take hefty money
from respectable people. This is your profession. Have you lost your mind? I have not come here to
take money from anyone. Yes, then why were
you sitting here? Yes, so it is forbidden to sit here? Do one thing, put up a board here stating ‘ You cannot sit here’. Okay? Look at that, first you steal and then
you blame me. I am not a thief. Mind what you say. Madam, teach me manners later. Come on, leave from here. Cheap man. He has no shame. Hey, madam… People nowadays have no humanity. Child, if you go to Mr. Qasim’s home, then I will be satisfied. No aunt, I don’t want to go back to his home and become a burden on him again. I will live alone. I will stand up on my feet myself. How do you make such
big decisions, child? Ramsha, I am in the car right now and I am going to Mirpur. Mama called in the morning, papa is really unwell. He had a heart attack, and I am sorry, I forgot to inform you. I left in a haste. Sorry Ramsha, but please, you make some
other arrangement. I am really worried right now, I will talk to you later. You are begging wearing
such good clothes. I am not a beggar. I know girls like you well. You wear good clothes, you hold a good bag, you cry about your poverty
and helplessness and take hefty money
from respectable people. This is your profession. Have you lost your mind? I have not come here to take
money from anyone. Yes, then why were
you sitting here? Yes, so it is forbidden to sit here? Do one thing, put up a board here stating ‘You cannot sit here’. Okay? Look at that, first you steal and then
you blame me. Dad, Ramsha’s number is off. That child has a lot of self-respect. She knows we will contact her, so she turned off her number. She wants that we are not able
to do anything for her. She doesn’t want to take
a favor from us, that’s why she didn’t tell anyone anything. Afnan, it is my fault, I should have stayed updated on her. God have mercy on this child, save her from any further tests. Call that friend of hers, whose number you had. Dad, I am calling constantly, but it is out of reach. That cousin of Ramsha, what was her name? Annie Yes. Yes. She had told
you the address, right? So let’s go there. Come on. Sure dad. Hey look, there is Ramsha. Stop. Stop the car. Greeting uncle. Don’t call me uncle. You are nothing to me, you and I have no relation. If you and I had a relation, you would have at least informed
me before leaving home. You didn’t trust me at all. You didn’t consider
me worthy of it, Ramsha. It is not that, I just didn’t want to worry you. You have worried me. We are looking for you
all around the city. We are worried. Now will I ask you to sit in the car or do you not intend on doing this? If you don’t intend on it, then fine. Let the little respect I have remain. Pick up her bag, man. Okay. Okay, I will talk to you. Okay. Alizay. Yes? Where is Afnan? I don’t see him. Mama, how would I know where he is. What sort of a wife are you? You don’t know where
your husband is, who is he with? Mama, I am his wife, not a spy that I would know where he is,
 what is he doing. Hey wives have to be spies. You should know who he is with, when he will come home. You know, when your papa would 
get last from the office, then I would know 
why he has gotten late, when will he come home, who is he with at that time. And you are acting so carefree. Where is brother? I don’t know. Greetings. Greetings. Alizay, Afsheen, meet her, this is my daughter, Ramsha. She has come back to her home, and from now on, 
she will live in her home. Come on, child. Come on. Come to your room. Come on. Come. So she is responsible for it, Afnan. If she got married to Shani, then she should have compromised 
and lived with him. After all, Shani accepted her after
 so much happened. Who marries such girls? What happened?
 Why are you looking at me like that? You too rejected her. Yes. Maybe that was the
 biggest mistake of my life. Alizay, what happened to you? Afnan, what is uncle saying? Ramsha will live with 
us in this home? I don’t understand how he can even say this. Hey, what is there to 
understand in this? It is dad’s decision, he said she would stay, 
so she will stay. But how can she live in this
 home as our family member? Look, neither is this my decision, nor can I say anything to dad on this. It is his home, it is his will, he can keep who he wants at this home, he can drag out whoever he wants. Yes, so this is a home, not a hotel that anyone will come and stay. Look at you, you are so relaxed. In fact, you must be happy, right? Ramsha is here. Look, don’t talk nonsense with me. Alizay, what sort of 
a person are you? You should see someone else with the
 eyes of humanity for a change. You know well, Ramsha is going 
through tough times, she needs support 
of her own at this time, that’s why dad made this decision. Afnan, who is her own here,
 in this home? Her own dragged her 
out of her home, now why is she coming 
to this home? If you want to argue,
 then go do it with dad. I cannot do anything in this matter. Madam, Ramsha, I felt bad hearing about you. My heart sank hearing
 about your divorce. People call women 
who get divorced in young age bad. Madam Ramsha, don’t mind
 what I am saying, I am talking about 
the behavior of people. You are really good, despite this, those people didn’t care for you. I would say, something like this should happen 
with their daughter as well. As you sow, so shall you reap. God forbid, Tabassum. 
What are you saying? God forbid that any girl has
 to face what I had to face. May God keep all girls
 happy with their husbands. Whatever has happened with me, I am sure God has something 
better planned for me. Madam Ramsha, I have seen when girls get divorced, they curse their in-laws. You are talking about their betterment. When you are hurt, 
it gets a little difficult to be patient. It is good that you came back to this home. The life of this home has returned. By the way, madam Alizay spends 
her entire day in the office and madam Afsheen spends most of the day out of home. I didn’t want to come back to this home.
