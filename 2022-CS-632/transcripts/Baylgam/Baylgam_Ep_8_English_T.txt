[17.00] Alizeh, what is wrong with you?
[19.32] You are that upset?
[21.32] Look at me.
[24.12] Why are you making a big deal 
out of such a small issue?
[29.40] Listen, I cannot tolerate this behavior
 from you.
[34.56] I have been restless all night, 
I couldn’t even sleep because of you.
[38.36] You must not be able to sleep because 
you were missing someone.
[41.60] What?
[45.04] I am so sorry not at you but myself,
[49.48] in fact I feel sorry on my love for you
[51.32] that I cannot prove you how 
sincere I am with you,
[54.56] I cannot affect you that my love for you…
[56.88] Afnan, who was that girl?
[63.52] So, all this happening 
because of that girl?
[66.92] She was an acquaintance.
[71.32] I went to the restaurant 
so I met her there
[74.16] and just spoke to her for a while,
[76.40] and you are creating this huge fight 
for such an unimportant person?
[80.36] Unimportant girl?
[83.24] You lied to me for an unimportant girl?
[87.24] You could have told me the truth as well.
[89.04] I was joking.
[91.88] I was teasing you like usual.
[99.88] But the good thing about this is 
that I got to know
[104.72] that you love me
[107.20] and you love me a lot. Right?
[115.32] Okay enough now,
[118.40] how long will you remain upset?
[122.16] I swear to God! I will never do 
that again, okay?
[126.76] I have made coffee for you 
with so much love,
[129.96] it is getting cold, have it.
[142.92] How did you like it?
[145.72] Exactly like you,
[151.00] very nice.
[154.76] I thought you were about 
to say very bad.
[157.48] That is what I should have said.
[159.12] yes, you will find me bad right now,
[160.92] you don’t think I am bad when you ask me 
Afnan pick me from here,
[164.16] Afnan drop me there,
take me shopping.
[166.68] So what? I don’t force you.
[180.40] Oh, Thank God.
[189.80] What happened?
[190.96] I am just checking if you are okay?
Did something happen to you?
[194.40] God forbid, something happens to me.
[195.96] Whatever has to happen must 
happen to my enemies,
[197.40] why will anything happen to me? Idiot.
[199.52] Are you even in your senses Ramsha?
[201.80] I mean, all your senses are 
working fine, right?
[206.20] Annie, what is wrong with you? 
Why are you talking childish?
[209.56] I am absolutely fine,
 I can see you,
[212.24] I can even hear your voice, 
and I can even speak,
[214.72] should I cut my tongue off 
and show it to you?
[218.08] I am surprised how your craze for 
Mr. Afnan got away so quickly?
[223.20] What?
[225.32] What are you saying? 
Where did Afnan came from?
[227.36] I thought you must be going crazy 
for Afnan
[229.76] but when mom told me that you have 
agreed to marry brother…
[233.60] What, what, what? 
What are you saying?
[236.48] Agreed to marry brother? 
Are you out of your mind?
[239.84] Mom has told me, and I guess 
dad must have told mom.
[242.76] Are you mad?
[244.72] I will agree to marry your brother? 
Oh God! Forgive me.
[247.44] I will go and fix their brains right now. 
All of them have gone mad.
[250.36] What happened? 
mom,
[252.68] who has said that I agreed 
to marry Shani?
[257.00] actually, your uncle had some 
misunderstanding
[261.04] and you know your dad was really trying 
to make your uncle understand but he…
[264.88] Misunderstanding and that to for me?
[268.32] Go and refuse uncle right now.
[270.68] Tell him that I don’t want to marry Shani.
[273.92] I have asked your dad, 
he will talk to your uncle.
[278.08] Really? When? 
When will he talk?
[281.68] Now I understand,
[283.20] this is why your mom gave me 
the entire box of sweets, right?
[286.64] Look the matter has just happen,
[289.24] if we refuse immediately so your uncle 
will feel very bad
[294.32] that is why your father will talk, 
don’t worry.
[297.16] what is wrong with you all? 
Mom?
[299.72] Ramsha, brother is actually very happy,
aunt is right.
[304.04] Yes, look poor Shani was ready, 
he was the one who asked.
[310.20] The boy is very happy.
[312.04] Shani did?
[318.60] I will crush this Shani 
with my own hands.
[320.76] Hey?
[322.88] What is wrong with her?
[324.52] She has been after my brother.
[338.04] Afsheen? Do you want to say something?
[340.40] Brother I will come again.
[342.12] No, no, sit down, sit, sit.
[347.76] I have an idea that
[350.36] you are also worried for children.
[353.44] Brother I have tried talking to Alizeh
[356.80] but she doesn’t give me any response.
[361.48] You must talk to Afnan,
[363.76] in fact I would suggest that you make them
 sit in front of you and talk clearly.
[368.24] You are right,
[370.68] I am thinking the same.
[372.64] The air in the home is becoming strange,
[374.88] there used to be such happy environment 
in the house because of these children.
[378.36] Absolutely.
[383.20] Umm,
[384.56] tell Mr. Afnan that I am calling him
[387.08] Okay.
[387.88] in fact, tell Madam Alizeh as well, 
that I am calling her.
[389.76] okay fine.
[393.12] brother, we got them hitched with 
so much love and pride
[400.68] and I thought that my daughter will 
stay in front of my sight
[405.20] but everything is going 
upside down here.
[407.52] Don’t worry I will talk to both of them.
[411.36] Yes, uncle? 
You called me?
[413.48] Yes I did, sit down.
[419.68] Is everything okay Dad? 
Did you call me?
[421.68] Sit down.
[422.84] I have called both of you here.
[430.96] I have made a huge mistake 
by getting you two to marry,
[438.08] this is why I have decided 
to end this relation.
[442.12] What? Dad,
[444.76] what? What are you saying?
[446.48] Are you joking? Why are you saying this?
[449.20] Because you don’t like each other.
[451.84] We had a misunderstanding 
that is why we have decided…
[454.00] No, no uncle, there is nothing like that.
[456.08] Then what is it, my child?
[459.00] What is it?
[460.28] You don’t even tell me and 
keep on fighting,
[466.04] you don’t care about your elders.
[467.68] We think we are concerned for you 
and you don’t care about us.
[472.12] Sorry, uncle.
[474.12] What sorry? Dad, 
dad I can explain it to you.
[477.24] We had a misunderstanding
 between us,
[479.60] it got a bit dragged but we have sorted it out
and we are both very happy together.
[485.08] Dad seriously, please don’t 
end this relationship.
[490.64] brother,
[492.08] please ask Alizeh as well
[494.24] because I can’t really judge her mood,
[497.08] she might refuse to marry if she dislikes
anything Afnan would say in future.
[503.12] I mean, like it’s not marriage 
but some sort of a game.
[506.08] Mom, please, what is wrong with you?
[509.24] Just think and then respond.
[513.96] Now we can’t do this that we should run
 after you and then him.
[519.00] Uncle, you don’t have to run 
after anyone,
[521.76] we have sorted it out between us, 
there is no problem now.
[528.52] Say it.
[529.56] Yes, we have sorted it out. 
We are good.
[558.92] Ramsha, listen to me?
[560.48] Where are you going? 
Where are you going?
[562.36] I am going to fix your 
mad brother’s brain.
[565.36] Please Ramsha, try to understand
[567.24] that he is very happy, if you will just go 
and say everything to him like this,
[569.80] he will get very sad.
[571.96] Are you serious. Annie?
[573.60] You care about your brother 
and not me?
[575.60] I care about you as well
[577.08] but Ramsha, aunt has said
that she will talk to uncle
[579.96] and uncle will tell everyone 
the truth himself
[581.76] so brother will find out too.
[583.84] This is all my fault,
[585.48] I should have said no 
in front of everyone
[587.72] so that no one would have 
misunderstood anything
[589.80] and your brother wouldn’t be falsely happy 
because of this misunderstanding that,
[592.60] I… I will marry him.
[595.68] Okay, okay, don’t marry brother at all, 
don’t do it
[598.96] but please just stay quiet for now, 
and go in your room for now.
[602.56] Annie, I am very angry 
at your brother right now
[606.00] so it’s better that you go inside
[607.80] else I will forget that 
you are my friend
[610.44] because right now you just seem 
to be Shani’s sister to me.
[614.04] I won’t spare your brother today, 
just wait and watch.
[616.36] Ramsha? Ramsha?
[619.48] Ramsha? Dude! 
Oh God please save brother.
[622.16] Shani! Shani?
[626.44] Shani?
[628.32] Shani? Where are you?
[630.96] What happened? 
Why are you so angry?
[633.92] What did you think 
I would come here and shyly
[636.36] say that Shani,
[637.80] why didn’t you say it to me 
if you liked me?
[639.84] Oh my God! Shani I am so lucky!
[643.16] How dare you liked me?
[646.08] Okay fine if you liked me,
[648.04] I am beautiful and pretty too,
[650.48] any boy can fall for me
[652.60] so what does that mean
[654.16] that you will ask your mom 
to take proposal for me?
[657.44] Ramsha, you are my cousin,
[659.12] why are you getting so mad about it?
[661.72] And uncle was saying that 
you accepted the proposal?
[663.80] There was a misunderstanding,
[667.00] Dad went to refuse uncle and 
uncle didn’t even listen to dad
[670.88] that is why you all thought that 
misunderstanding was a yes,
[674.88] that is why I thought myself
[676.44] that I should come here myself 
and fix your brain.
[680.84] I, Ramsha,
[683.96] do not want to marry you.
[686.68] Did you hear that?
[689.08] And have you ever seen yourself?
 Yeah?
[691.80] Have you ever seen yourself 
you look so weird,
[695.84] you don’t even know 
the ABCs of education,
[698.36] you uneducated man,
[699.84] just passing matric doesn’t make
one educated.
[702.64] And how did you even think that I,
[705.08] such a beautiful girl will marry you?
[708.60] Actually I… 
Enough!
[710.64] Just shut up!
[713.68] Because when you speak, 
I feel pain in my ears.
[719.00] Have you seen yourself? 
You don't have the manners to talk,
[721.48] to sit or to walk! You have no manners 
at all and what do you wear?
[728.88] If you look at the boys 
from good families
[730.84] you will then know the way 
of speaking and sitting!
[736.52] Like you are someone 
who can marry me.
[746.48] Ramsha, I love you.
[748.12] To hell with your love,
[751.00] I have shown you your place 
in person today,
[755.12] next time if you even talk about love,
[758.36] I will humiliate you in front of everyone
 so that you will remember it for life.
[763.88] You can only dream about a beautiful girl
like me, Mr. Shani,
[769.68] not in your life for real!
[772.88] Do keep that in your mind!
[852.52] Oh God! You just use TikTok 24 hours.
[855.28] Haww mom? 
Shut it down.
[856.72] I made such a nice TikTok,
[858.80] what have you done? 
Couldn’t you see?
[861.40] You ruined it.
[863.68] Tell me what did you say to Shani?
[866.56] What have you said to him?
[868.16] Shani, I haven’t said anything.
[872.84] Why?
[874.40] Ramsha, don’t lie.
[876.24] it means he couldn’t be patient and 
he came and told you everything immediately.
[879.12] What a snitcher!
[880.88] Enough, for God’s sake, enough!
[883.68] And whatever you are doing,
[885.72] you could have thought before doing it 
that we are elders and we are in this house,
[889.24] we didn’t die, 
we could have spoken to them,
[891.60] Salma was very angry 
because of what you did.
[895.16] Aunt Salma just needs a chance 
to get angry at me
[898.16] and that too for no reason. 
Really?
[900.08] Salma is mad that she gets angry 
on you for no reason.
[904.12] Haw! See, you spoke your heart, 
you said it.
[908.40] For God’s sake Ramsha, 
enough now.
[909.88] I get really embarrassed 
because of what you do.
[913.44] And there is no shame in your eyes,
I guess.
[917.68] And this dress,
[919.56] you just bought it and 
you are already wearing it
[922.00] and then when we have to go out somewhere,
you never have clothes.
[925.36] Now turn this off and help me 
in the kitchen.
[931.60] They don’t know that 
TikTok stars don’t work,
[934.96] they just make TikToks.
[957.40] Did you ask sir what we have to make?
[959.48] Yes, yes.
[960.36] Okay, I am going to go take this call, 
I will be back in two minutes,
[962.12] you guys just stay here, okay? Wait.,
[964.72] Let me try and call, 
Afnan might pick my call.
[971.92] Oh god!
[974.16] She is bothering me 
by constantly calling.
[977.96] I have to do something about her.
[983.68] Hello.
[984.76] Hello?
[986.12] Thank God, you picked my call, Afnan.
[988.68] Because I know you aren’t going 
to leave my life like that.
[991.80] Really? That is how much 
you dislike me?
[994.76] No, not that much but a little bit.
[1000.72] Do you actually dislike me?
[1003.28] Ramsha, I am going for a meeting,
[1006.04] and I don’t like when someone disturbs me
 in the middle of work.
[1011.76] Okay you tell me why are you worried?
[1014.12] Thank God that you didn’t say 
that why are you worrying me,
[1017.04] else my heart would have broken.
[1018.48] Really?
[1019.92] That’s how weak your heart is?
[1022.36] Yes, it is a little two weak about you.
[1024.84] Okay, we will try it sometime.
[1028.20] No, no, Afnan, never do anything 
like that ever.
[1032.16] I won’t be able to bear.
[1035.72] Where do you learn all this from?
[1038.12] Sometimes I feel you are habitual
 of talking like this.
[1040.96] Haww!
[1042.04] No, what do you think I talk to everyone 
like this apart from you?
[1045.08] I don’t know,
[1046.76] but I find all this a little weird
[1051.76] and I like it a little too that is why 
I talk to you.
[1056.64] Hmm, after saying all this when you said
 that you like it a little,
[1060.92] I really liked hearing that.
[1062.72] okay now, I have reached the meeting,
[1064.60] I am going inside, 
I will talk to you later.
[1066.92] Bye.
[1068.16] Okay, bye.
[1071.08] Annie? Annie, dude.
[1074.40] Annie, listen to me? 
What happened?
[1077.28] You are still mad at me? 
Stop now.
[1080.48] You wouldn’t have done all this 
had you care, Ramsha.
[1083.76] What is wrong with you guys?
[1085.48] If I don’t like your brother 
then I just don’t,
[1087.64] I have just refused that then 
why is everyone getting so mad?
[1091.68] Okay just leave it, 
let’s go to the canteen.
[1095.00] I mean just let this topic go, 
let’s go to the canteen, come.
[1099.28] Come.
[1121.40] Just keep on doing this,
[1122.96] work all day and then get tired 
and sleep.
[1126.32] Don’t you want to go?
[1127.92] Where?
[1129.36] Shopping, for engagement shopping.
[1132.96] What are we wearing for the engagement,
what should we buy, we know nothing.
[1137.20] Afnan forgot, mom told me.
[1139.84] hmm so now what are you thinking?
We are getting late, let’s go.
[1142.68] Afnan, I am very tired right now,
[1146.24] shall we go tomorrow?
[1148.40] Oh!
[1149.44] Why don’t you quit this job? 
You are always tired because of it.
[1153.72] Afnan please,
[1155.24] I don’t even have the energy 
to argue with you right now.
[1158.56] okay fine, fine, don’t argue,
[1161.32] but you can atleast get leaves 
a few days before engagement?
[1165.12] But why?
[1167.04] Who takes leaves for 
engagement Afnan?
[1169.84] What do you even say?
[1171.96] And I am very tired today, 
we will just go tomorrow.
[1180.08] Okay.
[1183.40] As you wish.
[1199.44] Salma, I have talked to Ramsha,
[1203.28] look this will never happen again.
[1205.92] You know her very well,
[1209.04] she is a girl, she is naïve,
[1211.64] she has no etiquette 
about good or bad.
[1214.48] Look sister-in-law, 
I will forgive her
[1217.40] because she is exactly like my Annie
[1220.68] but no one else will do the same.
[1224.60] If her behavior remains the same,
[1226.52] she has to get married and 
go to another home,
[1228.80] how will you keep on giving 
explanations to everyone?
[1230.96] Yes, you are absolutely right by the way,
[1235.44] I am always worried 
when I think about it.
[1243.28] Look if Ramsha and Shani would have 
gotten married,
[1247.40] it was just better for Ramsha
[1250.32] because she is the girl from our home only 
and we are habitual of how she is,
[1254.88] but no one else will tolerate 
such behavior and talks.
[1258.60] You know that very well,
[1260.48] in laws make girls go through 
the worst for every little thing.
[1266.12] No one will tolerate her 
behavior at all,
[1268.72] only I and you can forgive her 
saying she is a little girl,
[1273.68] no one else will, 
you must understand this.
[1304.00] How much more will you 
make me wait?
[1307.08] We are just waiting for dad, 
we will leave once he is here.
[1310.20] You just quietly sip your coffee 
meanwhile.
[1313.00] I can’t sit quietly,
[1315.00] shut this off and talk about something.
[1316.92] So, then you must talk, 
who is stopping you?
[1319.08] I cannot stop working.
[1320.56] May I come in sir?
Yes, yes come in.
[1325.24] Sir these are some checks that 
need to be delivered today,
[1327.76] I needed signatures of Mr. Qasim, 
he hasn’t come,
[1330.92] so can you sign them?
[1333.40] No, no, I cannot sign them 
without asking dad,
[1337.24] do one thing,
[1338.60] let’s wait for dad if he doesn’t come 
then I will sign. Keep them here.
[1342.08] All right sir. Thank you.
[1344.24] You are welcome.
[1350.40] Who are you talking to?
[1354.00] No one, it was a marketing message.
[1357.84] So, tell me about your new friend?
[1363.84] Are you still going good with her?
[1368.64] Yes, it is going well
[1370.88] but I am just thinking of calling 
it quits now.
[1375.24] You know Alizeh saw me with her,
[1377.84] she got really angry,
[1380.16] I almost got in trouble and got out 
if it with so much difficulty.
[1384.24] okay then let her be, do one thing,
[1386.32] make me friends with her.
[1389.20] Fahad,
[1390.92] have you just developed this habit 
of interfering in others matters
[1394.68] or has it been since childhood?
[1396.52] Hey, why do you have a problem?
[1398.48] You are calling it quits with her,
[1400.20] so then what difference does it 
make to you?
[1401.68] it doesn’t make any difference to me, 
and why would it?
[1406.24] But she was a very interesting 
personality,
[1411.24] you know before meeting her I thought
[1413.56] it’s just us boys who lie to the girls,
[1415.96] but she was amazing,
[1418.44] she would say such things, 
will lie so much,
[1421.76] I used to be amused.
[1423.60] So much time would pass by laughing
with her that I wouldn’t even realize.
[1428.44] That is why I was developing 
interest in her.
[1433.60] Was?
[1435.32] That means it’s not anymore?
[1436.88] Or the interest has increased?
[1442.68] No, no I have no interest.
[1445.96] What would I even do with her?
[1448.12] I want to spend my life with Alizeh 
and everyone knows that,
[1451.28] I know it myself too
[1452.92] so what is the point of wasting 
some other girls time then?
[1455.76] Right?
[1460.24] I am telling you,
[1462.72] I have never interacted with 
that type of girl
[1466.08] so I was liking it, she was different, 
that’s it.
[1472.04] Look, just be sure that things don’t go 
in a way where you find someone different today,
[1475.92] it gets difficult to part ways from them.
[1486.20] Brother, stop having coffee,
[1488.48] come with me I will get you coffee
 from somewhere outside.
[1491.04] Dad must be in the mosque,
[1492.76] let’s go to him I need his signatures 
on this as well.
[1495.28] We are going to the mosque? 
yes, we are going to the mosque,
[1497.28] are you not allowed?
[1511.40] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1514.92] Greetings Uncle.  
Greetings, greetings,
[1518.24] so glad to see you here.
[1520.04] Umm sorry dad
[1522.28] we came here and disturbed you 
but the there was an important work,
[1524.92] I just needed your sign 
on the checks.
[1527.40] No problem, show me.
[1531.04] Let me check.
[1532.80] Yes, these checks, show me.
[1536.92] I actually forgot signing the checks
[1539.28] and it was very important to 
dispatch these checks today.
[1542.08] Yes. 
Here.
[1544.88] Thank you.
[1546.28] Yes, let’s go. 
I was saying that
[1548.72] now you have entered the house of God
[1550.56] then also offer congregational prayer.
[1555.20] Why not dad, absolutely.
[1557.24] We will go perform ablution. 
Stay blessed. Go.
[1559.60] Come, come.
[1568.44] Check out the video,
I got 25k views.
[1571.32] My God.
[1573.04] Look at her videos, 
she makes such weird videos.
[1574.84] Yes. 
I just laugh when I watch…
[1575.96] Annie?
[1578.72] What is going on here?
[1580.40] Nothing brother, I was just sitting.
[1584.12] You sit like this all day,
[1586.48] either you are always on your mobile
 or you are talking,
[1591.76] if I ever see a phone 
in your hand again,
[1594.16] I will throw it away. 
Do you understand?
[1596.68] This is not my phone, brother, 
this is Ramsha’s phone.
[1600.96] Yes.
[1605.04] And if you even think about 
breaking my phone,
[1609.12] I will break your head, 
do you understand?
[1612.72] You know me very well, right?
[1615.80] Mind your own business! 
I didn’t talk to you.
[1618.96] Huh!
[1620.92] And why are you standing here 
and watching?
[1622.84] Go help mom in the kitchen.
[1625.08] Go. 
okay brother, I am going.
[1629.08] Ever since I have refused 
to marry your brother,
[1632.20] he has become so bitter about me.
[1649.40] I will take a selfie, a very nice, 
beautiful selfie.
[1656.84] Oh wow.
[1663.72] Poor thing.
[1668.48] Peace be upon you and 
God’s mercy and blessings.
[1671.88] Peace be upon you and 
God’s mercy and blessings.
[1699.76] Afnan?
Hmm?
[1702.32] What’s up?
[1704.16] You are having coffee alone?
[1707.52] When do you have time for me?
[1712.04] Afnan?
[1716.28] I and all my time is just for you.
[1723.96] Trust me.
[1725.36] Really?
[1727.08] Are you serious?
[1728.60] hmm.
[1733.52] You look very beautiful today.
[1735.40] Hmm?
[1736.24] hmm, very beautiful,
[1739.76] what was I thinking that…
[1743.60] Whose call is it?
[1747.80] What was I saying?
[1749.04] Whose call is it?
[1750.28] Someone I know, a very unimportant man.
[1753.88] He has been calling since a while 
I wasn’t taking it,
[1755.68] I got sick and turned it off.
[1758.44] Look, if he is unimportant 
he cannot be a friend
[1761.00] and if he is a friend 
he cannot be unimportant.
[1763.40] so I have said he is not my friend.
[1765.40] He is just an acquaintance,
[1767.32] through a friend we went for a business 
meeting at lunch so I met him there,
[1772.64] they were mutual friends so 
I got to talk to him as well,
[1776.96] so then I spoke to him 
because of that
[1779.00] and he took my number and now 
he is annoying me to get his work done.
[1782.64] I can’t do all this.
[1784.12] So Afnan, you must refuse him,
[1786.16] this is wrong now, he is calling you,
you gave him your number yourself.
[1790.40] You are not even taking his call, 
it’s bad.
[1793.16] it is so sad by the way
[1795.00] Why?
[1795.80] I was talking to you so romantically,
[1798.16] I never expected a lecture.
[1801.40] Okay tell me, will you have coffee?
[1803.80] Umm yeah.
[1804.96] I am scared,
[1806.24] I cannot have coffee alone now
[1808.24] so I will immediately go and 
make coffee for you.
[1810.04] Okay.
[1826.36] By the way, if you wouldn’t have 
come to meet me today,
[1828.44] I would have gotten so mad at you.
[1833.16] That would have been great
[1834.92] because even I am thinking 
to stop talking to you now.
[1841.76] Haww! Why?
[1846.04] What?
[1847.04] What are you thinking? Tell me?
[1853.00] I am thinking that
[1855.20] if I hadn’t come to meet you would 
you actually stop talking to me?
[1860.72] Yes absolutely.
[1862.76] If you wouldn’t meet me or talk to me 
then why would I talk to you?
[1866.68] And by the way it has been 
so many days,
[1869.28] you should know me well by now.
[1873.36] That’s absolutely right but
[1875.84] you will be surprised to hear that
[1878.84] I haven’t just got to know you but 
I have also judged you very well now.
[1885.96] What do you mean?
[1887.68] nothing.
[1888.52] Tell me something,
[1890.32] what will you eat? 
Where should we go?
[1893.88] You tell me that what will you eat
 if you are hungry?
[1897.92] To be honest, I am not hungry at all.
[1900.32] Okay then let’s do one thing, 
let’s sit and talk a lot.
[1907.00] Okay, say it.
[1931.24] Saba? 
Yes?
[1933.16] Have you seen Ramsha?
[1934.44] Yes, she has left.
[1935.80] What do you mean by she left? 
Where is she?
[1937.20] It has been an hour since she left. 
I saw her going there.
[1942.96] okay, fine, thank you.
[1949.48] Hello?
Yes Ramsha?
[1951.48] Where are you?
[1952.44] I am waiting for you in the auto Rickshaw
 outside, can you come a little quickly?
[1955.84] You didn’t take your class? 
Saba was telling you left an hour back?
[1959.28] Yes, I was with him, Afnan.
[1962.24] Ramsha, are you out of your mind?
[1965.12] Now you have started doing all this?
[1966.56] Annie, don’t argue all the time, 
I am waiting in the rickshaw,
[1969.88] it has been so late, we even have 
to go home, hurry up.
[1972.28] okay I am coming, 
what does this girl do?
[1985.92] Come, come, come.
[1989.60] I am so happy, so happy, 
so happy.
[1992.00] Oh god!
[1993.64] You will get in trouble and get me 
in trouble with you as well.
[1996.12] my love,
[1997.68] the ones who love are not afraid of dying,
do you understand?
[2000.04] So then die alone, 
don’t take me with you.
[2001.88] If you had to go with Afnan, 
you could have told me once.
[2005.28] I called you 100 times,
[2007.08] you switch off your phone 
when you go in the class
[2009.20] and if I would have waited 
for your class to end,
[2011.64] I would have missed this chance.
[2013.32] And you know Afnan is always so busy,
[2015.76] I got a chance to meet him 
after so much difficulty today.
[2018.80] Ramsha, fix yourself.
[2023.32] okay leave all that,
[2024.60] tell me if your mom has some nice Saree.
[2029.04] Now where do you want to go in Saree?
[2031.48] I will make a video.
[2033.76] you are the limit Ramsha,
[2035.04] what is wrong with you Annie? 
Do even know
[2037.44] that people do so much to 
make videos nowadays.
[2039.72] Do you remember that girl 
went viral on TikTok,
[2042.36] she climbed a mountain to make a video 
and she even lit fire there
[2045.88] And do you remember 
what happened to her?
[2047.44] She had to suffer in prison and 
then she even got defamed.
[2050.76] So what?
[2051.96] We have to do anything to get viral 
these days even get defamed,
[2055.40] it’s not a big deal.
[2057.00] And by the way no one knew that girl,
[2059.00] after she made that video, she got 
so many views and everyone knew her.
[2063.00] Will you burn this house 
to get your video viral?
[2066.64] What is wrong with you, Annie? 
I have no such plans
[2069.28] and please get me a good Saree 
of your mom,
[2072.40] I will return after making a video.
[2074.16] Mom doesn’t have any Saree and
[2075.56] even if she did, 
I wouldn’t have brought it for you.
[2077.12] Mom is absolutely right, girl and boys 
have ruined themselves after social media.
[2081.28] You won’t bring it for me?
[2082.32] No I won’t. 
Get lost. Go.
[2084.60] Okay.
[2088.44] What will I do about the Saree now?
[2095.20] I will wear Mom’s Saree.
[2163.24] Oh God!
[2168.32] Ramsha!
[2170.00] You ruined my cupboard. Ramsha?
[2173.84] Ramsha?
[2189.36] Ramsha?
[2191.84] oh God! Mom, you ruined, 
my TikTok again?
[2194.60] What happens to you? Atleast watch out, 
you just get strated.
[2198.00] I am watching your acts very vividly
[2200.24] and who asked you to get a Saree 
from my cupboard?
[2202.96] Come on, go and change.
[2204.28] And I have told you
[2205.80] that girls in our family do not wear 
Saree before marriage.
[2210.08] What is wrong?
[2211.56] I just wore it for TikTok,
[2213.16] I am not wearing and roaming around
the house in it, mom.
[2215.16] I will burn your mobile.
[2217.88] Come on, you will ruin my new saree, 
go and change.
[2220.16] Oh God! Mom, you are such a liar,
[2223.04] new Saree?
[2224.40] You wore it at your younger 
uncle’s wedding
[2226.40] and it has been 12 years 
since his marriage now.
[2229.56] So how many times have I worn it?
[2232.04] Hardly once or twice.
[2233.92] So then say you have worn it 
multiple times.
[2237.76] I don’t want to argue with you, 
you go, go.
[2241.76] Mom, give me 10 minutes, 
I will just make two more TikToks,
[2244.28] I have worked so hard in getting ready,
don’t do this.
[2246.60] Ramsha, I won’t give you even a minute.
[2248.64] Go change right now.
[2250.12] Okay, just 5 more minutes, 
I will just make one more TikTok,
[2252.72] I worked so hard in getting ready.
[2254.16] And listen, go set my cupboard
 after changing,
[2257.24] and if you touch anything 
from my cupboard again,
[2260.80] you will see what I do to you. Go.
[2262.56] No.  
Go, go and change.
[2265.44] Why are you pushing me?
[2266.56] Go in front of me and change right now,
come on.
[2268.44] I am going. 
Hurry up.
[2272.88] She ruined my Saree.
