Try to understand what I am saying. It is just 5 lac rupees, arrange it from somewhere. And there is a huge difference between 
the currency here and there, you will get the money back 
in 2 to 4 months. It will be in your pocket and then 
you will live your life easily. Try to understand what I am saying. You even forgot how living with Ramsha 
can be so beneficial for you. What benefit? Do you remember what I said? If you keep Ramsha happy, I will give you what you want, I guess you forgot this deal, so I am offering you
 the same deal again, don’t cause any trouble to Ramsha, Keep her happy and it’s my job to fulfill my promise. I am offering again, take your time to think. I haven’t cracked a joke. Yes, you didn’t crack a joke but, in a way, I am in awe of your luck, how can Ramsha love a pathetic 
and selfish person like you? Oh hello, I am not here to listen to your lecture, I need money and you need 
Ramsha’s happiness, and right now we both are the need 
for each other, understand? Now tell me, do you agree 
with what I said? Do you know what? If Ramsha didn’t love you, I would have said it right here right now 
to you leave Ramsha and get out of our lives but sadly, the poor girl is fulfilling her responsibility 
of being a wife. She wants to live happily with you, which is why I cannot say 
anything to you. You must have done at least 
one good deed in your life and you are being rewarded for it 
in the face of Ramsha. Anyway… No, no, no, do you know 
what the actual thing is? I don’t know about my good deed but I remember all the sins of Ramsha and I am the punishment of her sins. Write the cheque. Here. Your wife is squirming here 
in front of you, she is pain and you don’t care about her? 
What kind of a husband are you? I have told you it’s a husband and wife’s
personal matter, do you understand? Don’t interfere else… Else what? Tell me what will you do?
Tell me? Afnan? Afnan, Afnan please you don’t interfere 
in our matter. This is my and Shani’s personal matter uncle please take Shani away 
from here. I have lost my child now I don’t want to lose my husband,
please Afnan leave. So that means her tears have 
brought you to a nobody like me? By the way my wife is very fortunate, I mean, someone else also cares about 
her tears apart from her husband. It’s not that, I am telling you that you are having 
a misunderstanding you should let the poison of doubt 
out of your heart. I am telling you again and again that 
she loves you a lot being your wife. There is nothing between us. 
And she is not well, she doesn’t feel good,
I am afraid that God forbid, something happens to her 
in this condition, then? It doesn’t make any difference to me. What you have done can ruin 
her home instead of making it, what is this foolish step? Thank God that Shani didn’t see you with 
Ramsha else he would have created havoc. I even advised you and warned you to stay away from Ramsha’s matters, 
I told you and now this is the last time
I am warning if you ever do any sort of interference 
in Ramsha’s matter, it won’t be good for you. Oh hello, I am not here to listen to your lecture, I need money and you need 
Ramsha’s happiness, and right now we both are the need 
for each other, understand? You must have done at least 
one good deed in your life and you are being rewarded for it 
in the face of Ramsha. Anyway… No, no, no, do you know what 
the actual thing is? I don’t know about my good deed but I remember all the sins of Ramsha and I am the punishment of her sins. I just don’t know what to tell? Shani is so angry, we are so worried
 because of him. I and Shani’s dad were thinking not 
to force him for no good reason, he might do something wrong. Umm, yes, you are right but also think that after all how long can Ramsha 
stay in our house for? She is not our but your responsibility. Yes, yes, you are absolutely right, actually brother Qasim the thing is that 
I don’t have the courage to face you, I am very embarrassed, I just have a request to make to you, keep Ramsha in your home for 
a few days to stay, meanwhile I will talk to Shani 
and convince him and then we will take Ramsha home. Look, there is no problem 
in keeping Ramsha here, in fact, this is her house but 
she is not happy here, she is very desperately waiting 
for Shani and you all. You do one thing, call Shani 
I will talk to him. Exactly and look accidents happen 
everywhere but that doesn’t mean at all that someone
should leave their wife like they have no one. Call Shani, please I will talk to him. Anwar is absolutely right, actually, Shani is not even home right now, and we promise you, let the issue cool down a little, we will come and pick Ramsha ourselves,
we promise you. Yes, yes. Absolutely, that is going to happen, 
exactly that. How can you do this, Shani? We decided that you will take away Ramsha
from here after taking the money from me. Now you cannot back out. Shani, I am telling you that you have 
to do all this for Ramsha… What price have you put out on me? Look Ramsha, whatever I am doing 
is for your happiness. Happiness? According to you, happiness is weighed 
through money, Afnan? According to you, there is no value of 
sincerity, love, and relationships. It is not that. Then what is it, Afnan? 
You did the same to me. You saw my status, not my love, 
my sincerity… You weighed everything 
by my status. That was the biggest mistake of my life, and I still regret it. For God’s sake, Afnan, stop making these mistakes because you make mistakes and 
I have to suffer. Alizeh, what happened? Why didn’t 
you come for dinner? Alizeh, are you feeling well? 
Why are you not saying anything? Alizeh, answer me, what happened?
Why are you sitting like this? What do you have to do with it? Why wouldn’t I have anything 
to do with it? I am your husband, 
I care about you. Afnan, don’t make more mistakes
by caring about me. You have already made a lot of 
mistakes in your life, like marrying me, not marrying Ramsha, you regret all this, right Afnan? it means, it means you overheard the conversation
between me and Ramsha? Mmhmm, I didn’t overhear anything I was just 
passing by so I kind of heard a few things. Look Alizeh, it’s not what you think, Ramsha was my past and 
you are my present. She was your past but why do I still 
see her in your present, Afnan? In your life, in your thoughts, 
in what you say, in fact, even in this house, 
she is all I see. Where am I? No Alizeh, look listen to me carefully 
and try to understand. I have heard and understood everything, I don’t trust anything you say now. Alizeh? Alizeh? You did great that you came here 
to pick Ramsha and you chose forgiveness. The relationship between a husband 
and a wife is very sensitive, if there is any contradiction 
or a misunderstanding between a husband and a wife, only the devil gets happy. You chose to forgive. 
You sit down, I will call Ramsha, okay? 
Have a seat. Stay blessed. By the way, despite of so much happening,
 I still brought you back. By the way you know what? 
Not everyone gets such a husband who ignore all the mistakes of his wife. What? Why are you looking at me like this? I am telling you the truth and look 
you have always humiliated me. I remember that the first time there was 
a word of our marriage being spoken, what happened? You clearly refused and 
I haven’t forgotten it but still, I thought about my late Uncle and 
aunt so I brought you back. But I am telling you once again,
if it was someone else in my place, they would have thrown you out
of their life. You didn’t do me any favor, it would have been a favor from you if you would have brought me here 
with love and kindness. You have taken money from Afnan to 
bring me back from there to here, right? Yeah? Tell me, how much money did you take? Money? Don’t act like you don’t know, Shani, you have taken money from Afnan 
to bring me back here, tell me how much money did you take? Thank God, Shani brought Ramsha back, 
the boy got some sense now. I don’t understand that how will they live their life? Disagreements are very common 
between husbands and wives but this doesn’t happen anywhere 
that they fight 24/7. Forget it, both of them…
You don't deserve to be lived with. What are you doing? You are escalating
 the issue for no reason. For no reason? I am escalating it for no reason? Yeah? Are you even ashamed, Shani? I am not going to live with you 
anymore now because I am not shameless 
and shallow like you. You haven’t left me capable to face 
anyone, you have hurt my integrity. I don’t want to live with you. Ramsha, listen to me. What is this noise? 
It is Ramsha’s voice. She is fighting with her husband 
right after coming back. She should be thanking God that 
he brought her back and she started to fight right 
after coming. Hey we don’t know the issue, 
you are calling it a fight. You must try to make your 
daughter-in-law understand, put some sense into her, tell her it’s not nice to fight with 
her husband all the time. Hey, at least you keep quiet, 
come let’s see what happened. Come. I said I don’t want to live, 
means I don’t want to. Ramsha, you are escalating the issue, 
keep the bag back. Go keep it inside. 
Shani? What is this noise you guys 
are making at midnight? And you, what have you been doing? You should be thankful that despite your mistake 
your husband brought you home and you are fighting on top of it? You are such an ungrateful woman. Really? Did I start the fight? Ask your son why he brought me back? Ask him what was the reason to 
bring me back, what was the love? Tell them, Shani? Will you tell, or should I? Tell them. Ramsha, I beg you. Please, go inside the room,
we will talk about it. Go inside the room. What is this? What is the matter? When she was leaving easily then what was the need to beg? You never begged us and you are being
a slave to your wife? Dad, this is the matter of us 
husband and wife, don’t interfere in it. 
Huh? Did you see it? Did you see your child? What did your child say? He is begging his wife, this is the kind of shameless 
children nowadays, they can just argue with their parents and they will be quiet in front of their wives 
and will beg them. Hmph! Matter of husband and wife. 
Shameless. Ramsha. Afnan. Sit down. Umm hand. Sorry. You don’t care about me at all, that shows I am not important 
for you at all. Really, look at me. Hey, look at me. Yes? If you weren’t important to me, I wouldn’t be here today. Okay, enough. Okay look at today’s videos. Listen? Where did you get these bangles from?
They are very nice. These are just crystal bangles. So, what if they are crystal? That’s a big thing, 
who likes crystal bangles? You like them by the way. 
I really like bangles in girl’s wrists but they look very special 
in your hands. Thank you. Then I will wear them 
daily from now on. Not because of this love and all, I came to you out of pity, I came to help you because 
I felt pity on you, so you could gather your leftover honor
and go back home but I didn’t know that you will 
become a pain for me instead. And yes, one last thing, you must thank God that it was me and I have been raised well, if it was any other guy instead of me, he would have brought so much 
disgrace to you. Do you actually not love me? Yes, I truly, falsely, in any world, 
I do not love you, Ramsha, but why don’t you understand, Ramsha? According to you, there is no value 
of sincerity, love, and relationships. It is not that. Then what is it, Afnan? 
You did the same to me. You saw my status, not my love,
my sincerity… You weighed everything by my status. That was the biggest mistake of my life, and I still regret it. For God’s sake, Afnan, stop making these mistakes because you make mistakes and 
I have to suffer. Are you telling the truth? Just like you I couldn’t believe it too, 
I was surprised too. Brother was never like this, he has gotten this craze of moving 
to Dubai because of Wasim, else he was never like this. That’s such a disgusting thing to do. Look, I cannot even face Afnan 
because of the pathetic thing Shani did. I wouldn’t even have found it out 
hadn’t I heard it because Afnan would have never told me. I am very angry on Afnan too. He shouldn’t have given money to Shani, who gives such huge amount. Afnan is a very nice man, the care brother should be doing for you, 
Afnan does it. I am right, Afnan takes 
very good care of you. Even a family never does this much but whatever it is, brother has done a very disgusting act, 
he shouldn’t have taken the money. You cannot keep anything 
to yourself, right? I even asked you not to tell
 anything to anyone. You should be ashamed, brother, you have lost your mind in the craze
of going abroad that you didn’t care about your respect, 
honor, shame or anything? You have taken money for your wife today,
in future you can sell your sister… Shut up! Uff ho! Shani? What is this behavior? Did you raise your hand on your sister?
Where did you learn that from? And what did she even do? 
What was the reason that you had to slap her? You tell me Ramsha,
what happened? Nothing.
