Is the shoot done? Yes. 
Show me, how are the videos? This video was better than before. I think this time we will get 
more response. Leave it. We have tried making in every way. We didn’t get more views on any video. I don’t know how do Tik Tokers 
get so much views, man. We didn’t even get a good payment 
till now. I think we will have to do something else 
to make the video. That’s how we can get famous. Hey, this is the shopping girl Ramsha. 
You wait here, I will come. Okay? Hi Ramsha. How are you? Did you not recognize me? I am Areeba, Hania’s friend. We met in Islamabad. And we also shot two commercials 
together. What happened, man? I should have difficulty recognizing you. You have changed your entire dressing. Nothing like that, I recognize you. How are you?
Are you fine? I am absolutely fine. 
You tell me, how are you? I don’t believe that you have changed
your dressing so much. Come on we will sit and talk somewhere. You met me after so long. No, no, I cannot go to the cafeteria. I have been told to wait here. Why buddy? Come on. You know you have changed 
your dressing so much, I cannot even recognize 
if you are the same Ramsha. This veil, this scarf, 
so much seriousness. Unbelievable, man. Yes, thank God, 
I have changed a lot. I have quit everything. Why? You were so famous? Then why did you step back? A person does what God wills. I am really thankful to God that 
He saved me from all the bad things that I was doing in my life. And without a doubt a person does 
what God wills. You believe me, I am really satisfied 
with my life and I am really happy. The person’s betterment is walking 
on the right path. Hello. Yes. Yes, Afnan. I am standing in 
the food court. Where are you? Where? Goodbye. Oh, boyfriend? No, he is my husband. I just told you I have quit everything. Hey come on, man, I am joking. Okay fine, okay, bye. Ahmad come quickly. Greetings, guys. I hope you people
 will be fine. So I have a big surprise for you 
and that surprise is that what is a famous Tik Toker, Ramsha,
called Shopping girl, doing nowadays, what she is not doing, 
where she is right now. I am going to tell you all this 
in my video today. I am sure you people would 
want to know that the girl the condition the girl 
who did wonders on social media is in. After going viral in one video 
on social media in one night, Ramsha said goodbye 
to social media, and has married a famous businessman 
in the city, Afnan Qasim. I am sure you will not believe all this, that is why I have proof of all this. 
Look at this video. Hello. This is Fahad. 
How are you? Fahad! Where are you lost? 
You called after so long. Hey, I am here. 
Where will I go? I felt that you got married, you didn’t call for so many days. Man, when do we have such luck. You know, I am not getting married once, and people have gotten married twice. Some people are so lucky, right? Now who got married for a second time? Afnan, who else? What? What are you trying to say? Hey, I called to congratulate you 
on Afnan’s second marriage. I thought he got married again 
with your permission. That’s why he showed so much courage, and put it on social media. What nonsense is this? You called to pull this 
cheap prank on me. Neither is this a prank, 
nor is it cheap. Hearing you talk I feel that 
he has also fooled you. And when you don’t know about 
his second marriage, then how would you know who he 
got married for the second time? Okay, I will tell you. Your beautiful co-wife’s name is… Ramsha. And now instead of arguing with me,
 watch the video I am sending you. Then maybe you will believe me, that your husband too has become 
really viral like that shopping girl Ramsha. I am sending it, check it out. After going viral in one video 
on social media in one night, Ramsha said goodbye 
to social media, and has married a famous businessman
in the city, Afnan Qasim. I am sure you will not believe all this, that is why I have proof of all this.
Look at this video. It was Afnan, Alizay. 
My eyes cannot deceive me. Why are you smiling? Mama, because this is not the fault of 
your eyes, in fact, it is the fault of your heart. You love Afnan so much. That’s why you see him everywhere. Now you remember, when your 
friend’s daughter got married, even there you found a boy 
just like Afnan, but it was someone else. Alizay, feeling it was Afnan and it being Afnan
are two separate things. It was Afnan, whether you accept it or not. Mama, I still called Afnan 
after you told me, he was in a meeting at that time. Afnan, whose voice was that? 
Where are you? What is wrong with you, Alizay? I am at the restaurant. My colleagues are with me. A colleague of mine asked about tea. Okay, listen, the meeting is about to start, 
I will call you back. Bye. Hel… You are here? What are you doing here? I had told you it is Zohaib and 
Sana’s anniversary, I came to shop for that. What are you doing here? Okay. Okay. Okay. Coincidentally I came to 
shop here as well. For whom? For you. Who else will I shop for Alizay? 
I bought all this for you. You got all this for me. I actually wanted to surprise you, but you caught me here. Hello. Yes, Afnan, where are you? I am in the office. Why? 
What happened? All okay? Okay, you are in the office. Yes, I am in the office, 
I have an important meeting. What happened? 
Did you want something? Fine, you do your meeting. Okay. Why are you so worried? What is wrong, Alizay? 
Why are you doing this? What am I doing? Now what torment have you brought 
on my head after, Ramsha. Alizay, talk slowly. I am giving you 
the last warning. Don’t do all this… Tell me honestly, who was that girl? It is good that everyone should find out, 
how you are cheating me… Shut up. Just shut up. Get out of this place. Get out of this place right now. What do you think? You will blame me
again and again and I will admit it in front of everyone. Your issue is that I come to talk to you, you shout, you misbehave. So why should I not shout? I will shout louder and tell everyone 
he cheated me. I cheated you, right? Fine, 
then you do one thing, don’t live with me. But today, tell me this clearly. My mind too will be clear, so I will make
 some arrangements for this. For God’s sake, you people be quiet. It would be much better if you make 
your daughter understand this. Look Afnan is getting married, he will not give you importance 
after marriage. Then what will you do? You will sit alone and get bored. That’s why I am saying be my friend. Hey, wait. Get out of my way. I am talking about coming close to you. I mean, our hearts will come close 
if we become friends, you are making me move. This….look, Ramsha, believe me. I will make you have a lot more fun 
than Afnan. Cheap man! Afnan. What was happening? Alizay had told me to drop Ramsha
 to the academy. I don’t know what happened to my car, 
it is stopping again and again. You did good that you came. Why don’t you drop her? I will take my car to the mechanic, huh? I had told you. 
How did you even dare? What is wrong, Afnan? When I had told you to stay away from 
that girl, then how did you even dare? You did something so cheap with her, 
that I don’t believe it. What are you doing, man? 
Leave me, people are watching. Everyone is watching? Everyone should find out. This man… he is a harasser. He took advantage of the helplessness 
of a helpless, oppressed girl. He harassed her. I am ashamed calling you 
my friend today. Hey a cheap man like you shouldn’t
be a part of this society. Leave me. Is she your lover that you are insulting 
your friend because of her? Every man doesn’t have a 
bad character like you. Neither do I have anything like that 
about her, nor is she bad character. And after today, if I even see you near Ramsha, I will kill you. Understand? Greetings. What happened? Is everything okay? 
Why are you people… so serious? Alizay. What happened? Why is everyone like… Were you not ashamed cheating me? You were unfaithful to me, Afnan. What did you think? 
I will not find out. Why don’t you say anything? 
Answer me. You think I am mad, 
you think I am stupid. You married that Ramsha. You cheated me. I was saying this from day one. And you kept on denying me. 
You married her, right? Tell me, why did you do this? Answer me. You have no answer. What will you say? You will deny it in front of everyone. I will show you, your video. Alizay, this…
Hold this. Watch it. Who is this? Watch it. Greetings, guys. 
I hope you people will be fine. So I have a big surprise for you 
and that surprise is that what is a famous Tik Toker, Ramsha, 
called Shopping girl, doing nowadays, what she is not doing, 
where she is right now. I am going to tell you all this 
in my video today. I am sure you people would 
want to know that the girl the condition the girl 
who did wonders on social media is in. After going viral in one video 
on social media in one night, Ramsha said goodbye 
to social media, and has married a famous businessman 
in the city, Afnan Qasim. I am sure you will not believe all this, that is why I have proof of all this. 
Look at this video. All this… Afnan, I trusted you more than my daughter. I supported you in everything. I always loved you like my own child, and you? What did you give to me in return? Huh? Sorrow, pain, torture. Do you have any idea Afnan,
what you have done? Aunt. Aunt, I am sorry. I know whatever 
I did must have hurt you, but hear me out once…
But what? But what, Afnan? You married Ramsha. What were you thinking 
when you did this? You brought a co-wife on my daughter. You didn’t think about your wife,
nor did you think about your future child. Meaning, you became so selfish… you should have cared about someone. Afnan, you ruined everything. I… I used to tell brother to drag out 
this girl from this home. She is a snake. She bit us. She bit everyone. You ended it all. Afnan, stay away from me. Please stay away from me. Alizay, listen to me with a cool head.
I am telling you, you… I don’t want to hear anything. You did what you wanted to.
