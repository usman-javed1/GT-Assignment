[20.76] Alizeh, you are still awake?
You haven’t slept yet?
[26.56] When a wife has a husband like you,
[28.40] how can she sleep peacefully?
[30.56] What rubbish?
[33.24] I am absolutely right,
[41.60] I used to think you are careless
about me
[50.08] but turns out
you are feelingless too.
[54.40] When was I feelingless now, Alizeh?
[57.28] If this is not being feelingless
then what is it?
[67.40] The person who tried to kill me,
[70.20] you got him bailed?
[89.84] Look Alizeh,
[92.36] I understand your anger
[94.80] but I was helpless to get
Shani’s bail.
[98.36] You were not helpless,
[100.24] you got him bailed because
Ramsha asked you to.
[110.04] Afnan, learn something
from Ramsha,
[119.24] learn to fulfill relationships
from her,
[126.72] Ramsha is better than you who is
still ready to die for her ex-husband.
[133.32] Just shut up!
[153.44] There is no need to be angry at me,
[155.28] if you want to ask, ask your wife,
[157.28] ask her why is she dying after Shani.
[183.24] Thank God,
[185.40] that Afnan got you bailed
[194.32] else we wouldn’t be able
to face anyone.
[205.12] We have made Annie’s in laws
understand after so much difficulty.
[210.36] By the way who asked you to go
beg Afnan to get me out of there?
[214.68] Yeah?
[222.00] What would have happened
if I had spent two nights in jail?
[231.48] It wasn’t the end of the world.
[233.96] Are you in your senses?
[235.64] Your sister has her wedding
after two days
[245.16] and how would it look that
[247.64] sister is getting married and
the police are taking the brother,
[258.04] do you have any idea
[259.28] what the hell we were going through,
[268.00] I thank God that Afnan got you bailed
[271.60] else your sister’s home would have
destroyed before even being made,
[275.24] we are saved from the humiliation.
[276.48] Enough mom,
[278.64] there is no need to take
this useless favor from them.
[288.32] When I am telling you
I didn’t do anything wrong
[290.96] and they were the ones
who did wrong?
[292.32] So what was the problem?
[298.20] They would have taken us
to the court.
[300.68] The court would have let me go.
[309.28] Because I didn’t do anything wrong.
[315.96] But no, we want to take
favors from them.
[318.40] Shut up, Shani.
[320.12] There are some things,
if they don’t get done in time,
[323.52] then it doesn’t matter
if they get done or not.
[335.04] And yes, listen,
[340.40] your Dad has said
[342.52] you won’t go anywhere out,
[344.04] he will take care of all
the outside chores
[351.40] and you will look after
the chores inside the house.
[354.04] What is this, now?
[355.04] I don’t know,
[357.00] your Dad told me this,
so I informed you,
[360.12] now go argue with him, not me.
[368.20] Won’t go out?
[371.16] What strange things are
they saying?
[392.92] Alizay,
[395.56] is everything okay?
[397.44] Yes.
[398.80] Did you ask the doctor 
if it is a girl or a boy?
[410.16] I am asking you something, tell me, 
what did the doctor say?
[415.56] It is a baby girl.
[419.68] Congratulations to you.
[421.92] Now we will shop for a baby girl,
[425.12] I will change your room 
completely to pink.
[428.04] I will decorate it all myself. 
I am so happy.
[438.28] What is the matter? 
You are not happy.
[441.48] What if Ramsha has a son, then?
[445.20] What are you saying?
[453.32] It is not necessary.
[455.28] What things do you keep 
on thinking?
[462.36] You should be happy. 
Thank God.
[466.40] Come on.
[558.04] You did good that 
you told me all this.
[561.32] Now lets do one thing, 
let’s not waste time
[564.12] and we will do all the shopping 
for you.
[567.16] Should we go today?
[570.60] Afnan can I ask you something?
[573.12] Yes.
[577.56] Are you really happy or are 
just trying to be happy for me?
[587.12] What does this mean?
[597.80] Hey, I am really happy.
[600.20] Really, really happy.
[608.92] Daughters are a blessing 
from God.
[614.00] Yes
[616.08] but you wanted a son, Afnan.
[625.84] You had said that you wanted to
name our child after uncle.
[635.24] What difference does what I want 
or what I don’t want make.
[649.84] I wanted a child from you.
[661.36] Now whether that is a son 
or daughter,
[663.92] they will be ours.
[674.44] As far as a son is concerned,
[676.28] then he will be born 
when the time comes.
[687.80] We cannot do anything more 
about this, right?
[703.32] Hello.
[705.20] Yes, yes, I absolutely remember.
[706.72] I remember.
[713.24] Just give me fifteen minutes, 
I will change and come.
[716.20] Okay. Okay. Bye.
[718.16] Listen, I have a really 
important meeting,
[720.00] I will deal with that, after that
we will plan our shopping.
[722.76] Okay?
[723.68] You take care of yourself.
[763.52] Yes,
[766.92] but now I do have this desire 
in my heart,
[772.88] that if I have a son,
[777.36] then I name him after my father.
[785.08] Qasim.
[818.88] You listen to me once, Afnan.
[822.28] Only Shani didn’t have a fault 
in whatever happened.
[825.52] He told uncle that he came here
 to get the jewelry and aunt
[829.76] and Alizay, provoked him so much
that he took this step.
[833.32] Come on, please,
[835.24] don’t tell me this false story of Shani.
[837.92] Afnan, think about this yourself.
[840.24] His sister is getting married, his sister 
is sitting for her mayun at home,
[842.56] her in-laws are there, 
there are guests in the home.
[844.84] If he had to create this scene, then 
why would he do it on this day only?
[848.08] He could have done this on 
some other day as well.
[851.08] Think with a cool head,
[852.96] no matter how big of 
an enemy someone is of you,
[855.00] at least you will not do all this 
on the day of your sister’s wedding.
[858.84] I just want that whatever 
you want do with Shani,
[862.32] whatever proceeding 
you want to do, do it.
[864.88] But let Annie get married once, 
please.
[870.56] I used to feel that you are careless 
in my matter.
[874.44] But you are also indifferent 
along with being careless.
[878.84] Alizay, how have I been 
indifferent towards you?
[881.68] If this is not indifference, 
then what is it?
[884.76] You got the man who tried 
to take my life,
[887.52] released on bail.
[889.84] Look Alizay,
[892.24] I can understand your anger,
[894.72] but getting Shani released on bail
was my helplessness.
[898.20] It was not your helplessness,
[900.08] you got the bail done 
on Ramsha’s insistence.
[904.48] Afnan learn something 
from Ramsha.
[907.40] Learn to live in relations from her.
[910.44] Hey, Ramsha is better than you,
[912.24] who is ready to do anything 
for her ex-husband.
[954.68] You didn’t even have proper 
breakfast, Afnan.
[958.40] I am not hungry.
[975.60] You are still upset with me, right?
[984.00] Ramsha, whether I am upset or happy,
[987.56] what difference does it make to you?
[997.76] You always do what you want to do.
[1004.24] That’s not true Afnan,
you are misunderstanding me.
[1006.80] I am misunderstanding?
[1014.96] No Ramsha,
[1017.24] should I tell you something?
[1020.48] The dramas all of you people 
create at home,
[1024.28] because of that at least, my capability 
to think and understand has ended.
[1036.84] And if all this goes on, 
then I will go mad really soon.
[1042.16] Afnan, I just wanted that 
Annie’s home gets saved.
[1044.72] Annie’s home?
[1047.96] You just want to save Annie’s home?
[1056.80] And what about us, Ramsha?
[1066.36] What about our home? 
What about your home?
[1075.60] Have you ever thought of saving 
your own home?
[1079.20] What is wrong, Afnan?
[1080.52] They too are my own,
[1081.96] if I don’t think about them, 
then who will?
[1083.72] Fine. Fine. Fine. 
Absolutely fine,
[1085.08] I got my answer.
[1086.48] Afnan…
You do one thing,
[1088.00] you only think about them, 
don’t think about me.
[1090.72] Because they are your relatives, 
and me?
[1092.96] Who am I, Ramsha?
[1094.52] Afnan, this…
[1095.44] No, no, please. Please, now I don’t 
want fake consolation from you now.
[1098.56] I am already going through a lot difficulty
 for you and you don’t care about me.
[1103.00] What all do I hear from 
the world for you?
[1105.12] Do you have any idea the pain 
I am going through
[1107.48] to keep you with me, 
in this home.
[1110.24] But you have to save them. 
So you do one thing,
[1113.04] you shift there.
[1115.40] Go and stay there with your own,
[1117.28] so that you can find happiness,
[1119.08] so that you can find peace 
in your heart.
[1121.08] In fact, why don’t you 
do one thing?
[1122.80] Why are you doing me
a favor living here.
[1125.12] Go. Go over there. 
Afnan…
[1126.60] Go, go there, stay there, 
you will be happy.
[1135.72] Afnan, what are you saying?
[1137.52] There is nothing like that. 
You are misunderstanding me.
[1139.48] Listen to me…
I have a misunderstanding?
[1142.04] Me, Ramsha?
[1143.72] Hey, you don’t want to understand.
[1146.76] I am tolerating so much pain for you,
[1148.80] I am trying to make you understand
with so much love, but you?
[1151.24] Girls like you cannot understand,
[1153.76] you do what is in your heart.
[1156.24] No Afnan, there is nothing like that.
You listen to me.
[1158.92] I don’t want to listen to you, Ramsha.
[1163.56] You know, having hopes 
from you is wrong.
[1170.16] Hey, it is my fault, 
it is my mistake.
[1172.96] that I thought you would 
change your ways,
[1175.36] you will return to me. 
But no.
[1178.92] The one who has looked away
[1181.60] you can stop them in the way,
[1184.12] but you can never make them turn back.
[1190.44] If a person is embarrassed on what 
they did then even God forgives them.
[1195.96] Forgive me, please, Afnan.
[1199.08] God’s mercy is abundant for 
His creations, Ramsha.
[1206.76] A human is not that great.
[1211.56] You pray that God softens 
my heart towards you.
[1219.40] But right now I have no space for you
in my heart right now.
[1222.36] Afnan.
[1232.80] I am really embarrassed.
[1235.88] I should have trusted you.
[1243.24] I should have trusted your character, 
what you said,
[1246.24] I should have trusted everything.
[1255.68] But,
[1258.44] just give me one last chance,
[1262.44] this time you try trusting me.
[1272.00] I will not break your trust.
[1325.84] Do you want a son or a daughter?
[1328.52] We will accept whatever 
God gives us happily.
[1333.48] Yes, but every person has a desire too.
[1339.64] What is your desire?
[1341.88] Son or daughter?
[1345.04] My desire is only a healthy child.
[1350.76] I just pray that
[1353.08] whether God gives us a son 
or a daughter,
[1357.00] they are complete and 
they have a good fate.
[1373.88] Yes,
[1377.40] but now I do have this desire 
in my heart,
[1383.36] that if I have a son,
[1387.92] then I name him after my father.
[1395.52] Qasim.
[1422.60] Yes
[1424.64] but you wanted a son, Afnan.
[1430.32] You had said that you wanted 
to name our child after uncle.
[1439.52] What difference does what I want 
or what I don’t want make.
[1448.64] I wanted a child from you.
[1455.36] Now whether that is a son 
or daughter,
[1457.92] they will be ours.
[1463.64] As far as a son is concerned,
[1465.52] then he will be born 
when the time comes.
[1471.56] We cannot do anything more 
about this, right?
[1521.04] Oh God,
[1524.16] you are really merciful.
[1528.68] For the sake of Your beloved Prophet 
and his family,
[1535.84] clean my husband’s heart towards me.
[1540.36] Put love in the heart of my husband
for me, my Lord.
[1545.88] Accept my prayers.
[1558.68] Amen.
[1608.52] Where is Afnan?
[1610.36] Rasheeda was saying that maybe 
he went out for some work.
[1613.40] I have been calling him for so long,
he is not even answering my call.
[1617.80] By the way, why are you asking?
[1620.56] Is there something?
[1624.44] Shani has been released on bail.
[1627.76] What?
[1630.20] But mama, you were saying that 
you have filed such a case
[1633.40] that he will suffer in jail all his life.
[1635.36] Not even a single night has passed yet.
[1639.56] Ask this from your husband,
[1646.92] because Afnan got released on bail.
[1652.36] You got the man who tried 
to take my life,
[1655.12] released on bail.
[1660.48] Look Alizay,
[1662.92] I can understand your anger,
[1665.40] but getting Shani released on bail 
was my helplessness.
[1668.32] It was not your helplessness,
[1670.24] you got the bail done 
on Ramsha’s insistence.
[1674.72] Afnan learn something from Ramsha.
[1677.72] Learn to live in relations from her.
[1680.48] Hey, Ramsha is better than you,
[1682.20] who is ready to do anything 
for her ex-husband.
[1686.24] Just shut up.
[1698.72] My desire is only a healthy child.
[1702.84] I just pray that
[1705.16] whether God gives us a son 
or a daughter,
[1708.96] they are complete
[1714.12] and they have a good fate.
[1720.12] Yes,
[1723.40] but now I do have this desire 
in my heart,
[1729.24] that if I have a son,
[1733.92] then I name him after my father.
[1741.48] Qasim.
[1766.48] What is the matter? 
Why are you crying?
[1768.00] Mama.
[1769.76] Mama.
[1771.12] Mama, Ramsha has snatched 
Afnan from me.
[1774.36] She has snatched my Afnan from me.
[1778.92] Why are you saying these things?
[1780.84] What is the matter? Did Afnan 
say something to you?
[1784.08] He said nothing.
[1786.96] But Afnan wants a son,
[1789.84] if that Ramsha gives him a son,
[1792.44] then my importance will end, mama.
[1795.56] Because I will have a daughter.
[1798.60] Then what will happen to me and
my daughter, mama?
[1802.04] What will I do?
[1803.32] Afnan will leave me. I will have 
no importance, mama.
[1806.92] My love, don’t think that. 
Nothing like that will happen.
[1809.68] No matter how much I act strong,
[1811.60] no matter how much I feel 
I can do everything,
[1814.12] but I cannot live without Afnan.
[1817.00] I cannot live without him.
[1820.60] I cannot live without Afnan, mama.
[1822.96] If he leaves me?
[1825.12] If he leaves me, 
then what will I do?
[1827.28] I cannot live without him, 
I will die, mama.
[1829.76] That Ramsha has come
 to this home
[1833.32] and after the son, 
Afnan will leave me completely.
[1836.48] I will not be able to anything.
[1839.52] I will die without Afnan.
[1857.80] I cannot do that.
[1862.00] My hands are tied.
[1866.12] My hands are tied to the promise that
[1870.24] dad made me make before he left.
[1876.88] He put this responsibility on me,
[1881.20] that I will always take care of Ramsha.
[1892.00] You make Alizay understand,
[1895.92] I cannot break the promise 
I made to dad.
