[79.50] Accept it Bulla, you’ve surely lost today.
[105.25] Damn it! How come is he winning again and again?
[108.97] I fall from the top baby.
[111.14] I always have it figured out way before.
[115.18] You lunatics wouldn’t even have a single clue.
[117.02] I’ll make sure I get to you one day eventually.
[118.75] Hey guys, Listen to me
[120.00] Oh come off it! You’ve been blabbering the same thing ever since.
[123.38] It’s not just difficult to defeat him, it’s merely impossible.
[125.98] Yeah right you fake piece of Bollywood. What does he think of himself? Like a don or something?
[129.80] Looks guys do whatever you want to.
[132.25] Because I’m not going to be sticking around here for long anyway.
[135.49] Why so? Got your visa already?
[138.34] No worries, I’ll get the visa as well.
[140.28] And when it come, Your brother will get a job
[143.47] Parties
[144.64] And then. What do you call it?
[149.67] Permant Residence.
[151.94] Not Permant you idiot. It’s Permanent. At least learn to speak proper English first.
[157.66] Sure Uncle, go ahead and tease me as much as you want to.
[160.51] When I get to the UK, you’re all going to be calling me and begging to talk to foreign women.
[168.96] Yeah yeah yeah. The bird isn’t even in his hand and he’s already thinking of flying in the skies. At least go and ask your dad first.
[175.85] I’ll get him convinced.
[179.35] And if he doesn’t agree, I’ll spill chilies into his “Hooka”.
[183.22] But i will definitely go
[185.87] I will fly away at all costs. Even if I have to take the canal road route.
[187.54] That’s all good but how about leaving from here first?
[191.37] Yeah
[193.45] Uncle, How much we have to pay?
[195.18] Your bill is nearly.
[196.39] On second thoughts, put it all into my debt account.
[198.31] How many debts do you feel like inducting further?
[200.00] They just keep increasing and never even seem to end.
[202.91] God help you guys!
[206.62] All aboard!
[216.03] How’s the jump?
[218.87] Oey! What the hell are you freaks up to? Go spill your booze somewhere else!
[279.25] Smoke it up!
[295.71] Come on! Disperse!
[325.40] Samina
[327.18] Where is our son?
[329.32] Is Bulla back?
[331.78] Yes. He is asleep. Perhaps he’s tired.
[335.76] Tired?
[337.33] He’s always messing around aimlessly. Does he come home to rest only?
[341.47] No dad. He doesn’t mess around. In fact one of his friend called him today.
[345.54] Actually
[347.76] Actually today his friend called him
[351.74] He was calling him over for a job. Right mom?
[354.50] That’s where he went today.
[356.85] Yeah stop with the excuses already. You’re always covering up for him.
[362.05] Am I not aware of whatever he’s up to? Where he goes? Whatever he does? Whatever he’s involved in?
[366.54] I know everything
[368.33] You're my daughter. Don't be my mother
[371.76] I'm his father. I know everything about him.
[376.30] Let me call him
[377.75] Forget it. Just have your dinner.
[388.86] Hello Everyone
[389.75] Hello
[391.50] What’s up for food? Gosh I’m starving.
[394.98] I say Samina. We should have a public announcement today.
[400.00] That our son will actually sit us finally and have dinner together.
[403.57] What an achievement.
[405.92] Enough with sarcasm. Let’s have dinner first.
[407.83] Tomorrow
[409.15] You’ll be going to the police station with me from tomorrow.
[411.54] Why?
[413.08] What do you mean why? Do you want to waste yourself for a lifetime?
[416.80] At least get a proper job. Don’t you want to make a living?
[419.62] Or do you want to waste your whole life?
[422.42] Oh he’ll get settled. There’s enough time for that.
[426.39] Samina he’s just spoiled because of your pampering’s.
[430.00] I was already on the post of being a constable when I was of his age.
[435.59] What have you achieved?
[442.98] What you said?
[444.94] Just that your pace of progress like a tortoise in ten years is something I can achieve in five.
[451.54] Did you hear that?
[452.74] Are you listening to your charmed son?
[454.71] He’s ridiculing my entire honestly earning and hard working life with the pace of a tortoise.
[460.00] And you’re tolerating this?
[461.46] Okay just let it go. At least have dinner.
[466.01] It is because of these honesty values that we’ve never had a proper life mom.
[471.11] Son you only get basics for survival when you earn through honesty.
[473.62] If you’re that eager to fly high, then go and earn yourself.
[477.08] Children like you who take everything for granted can never feel satisfied.
[481.38] I’ll surely earn. At least I’ll be able to progress more in life.
[484.64] Do progress in life. Our best wishes are with you.
[490.00] No!
[490.74] Thank you so much dad.
[491.90] Don’t leave your food unfinished.
[493.24] Enough mom!
[494.71] I’m already full because of his taunts.
[497.50] What is it with this daily bickering and nonsense?
[501.75] Before getting up, clean this all. Both of you. Understood.
[506.00] Get up! Let’s go Areeba.
[508.56]  Let them do it on their own. What nonsense.
[514.24] Oh hello! Where do you think you’re going? Sit down.
[517.24] Eat if you please. You’re clearing this mess yourself eitherway.
[521.58] Do you expect me to work both outdoors and indoors?
[529.18] Mom’s gone.
[531.60] And he thinks as if he’s the brave one around here.
[537.72] Give me a plate
[543.70] Let’s go on darling!
[546.77] Let’s go on darling!
[553.55] Stop it with the singing Bulla.
[558.56] What’s gotten in to you?
[561.58] I had a dream Bulla.
[563.68] What dream?
[565.57] It was hell. There was fire all around.
[568.33] The angels told me that whatever work that we’re doing right now in our lives, it’s all wrong.
[573.09] Hold on. Just because you’re trying to look modest in your religious outfit, you think you can interact with angels now?
[577.25] I sought some help through holy recitations.
[579.74] What help? Help in selling this motorbike?
[582.15]  The angels (Karaman & Katabeen) sitting on both of our shoulders are taking all of this into account.
[585.11] Who?
[586.15] Karaman and Katabeen.
[588.69] Hey listen to me. We don’t manipulate anyone’s rights.
[592.41] We function over demand and supply.
[594.53] Whatever demand is called for we just supply it. That’s all.
[597.52] But Karaman and Katabeen..
[598.65] Hey I get the point okay?
[602.02] You need to get that as well.
[604.60] Focus on the work
[620.93] Look at me
[623.30] Look. At least hear me out?
[625.93] I just need a few more funds to fly away to the UK.
[629.58] As soon as I have them, we’ll quit this work.
[633.63] Okay?
[635.81] Alright then.
[637.26] That’s my boy.
[638.63] Order some tea.
[639.84] Hey uncle, can we get two cups of tea please?
[644.03] Hey Bulla. Look.
[657.05] I’ll be right back
[658.56] Just park the motorbike.
[660.81] Oh Bulla. Enough with the flirtations already. You won’t get anything out of it.
[670.00] What are you staring at? Stop it.
[672.58] Na can’t seem to stop myself
[675.14] My heart doesn't satisfy
[676.63] Really?
[678.58] My very own
[680.20] “Haimaa”
[684.29] Not “Haimaa”, my name’s “Hillah”
[686.82] Does that matter? You’re still “Haimaa” for me.
[695.92] Come here.
[697.18] Here’s a small gift for you.
[706.09] Bulla.
[708.43] How are you going to survive in the UK without me?
[713.03] It’s just a matter of a few months.
[716.13] I’ll call you over.
[717.36] Really?
[719.05] How can I come over? Dad won’t agree.
[722.97] Don’t worry about him, we’ll have him convinced.
[725.25] You sure?
[726.19] Surely.
[727.25] Okay take a look here.
[729.74] Take a look here. See what I’ve got.
[732.72] You know my friend Reema? Her employer gave away so many of her clothes to her. So I selected this one for myself.
[737.58] What do you think?
[739.28] Hey these are such tight fitted outfits.
[741.19] Don’t you feel ashamed?
[743.62] What’s there to be ashamed about?
[745.48] They just dress up like this over there in the UK.
[747.98] Always dress up according to the cultures where you dwell. I’m surely wearing these.
[751.53] Look..
[756.08] Don’t you like it?
[759.32] Fine. I’ll refuse her and won’t get it.
[761.94] Hey no. I was only kidding.
[764.76] Okay tell me. Do you have any other plans?
[769.39] Tight fitted outfits, make ups, heels, deezigneer bags.
[773.60] Oh it’s not deezigneer, It’s designer, designer.
[777.40] Whatever
[778.97] Do you want to see my “Billi” walk?
[782.27] What’s a “Billi” walk?
[783.21] Catwalk.
[785.01] I’m just going to do that over there and I have practiced it so much already.
[788.29] Want to see? Hold this, hold it.
[790.50] Let me show you right away.
[793.04] Look.
[795.26] Like this.
[800.63] Wow.
[802.26] Amazing.
[804.46] Be careful there.
[806.21] Just sit down, sit down.
[808.45] So what do you think?
[809.73] Yeah right catwalk.
[811.18] The flower please?
[814.04] I recommend walking straight first please.
[818.16] It’s great, marvelous.
[819.25] I’ll learnt that as well when I get there.
[827.28] It’s going to be so amazing there.
[828.72] Can I put my arm around you?
[830.00] Yeah sure.
[834.32] She’s calling you.
[849.15] Oh my God! What hell yeah?
[852.54] I won the game.
[853.53] Enough of your game!
[856.71] Oh wow. Biscuits.
[857.97] Manners! Don’t just dig in. It’s bad. Leave it.
[862.32] They’re just biscuits.
[863.73] Mom one thing is for sure. I’m really going to miss your cooking when I’ll be in the UK.
[870.25] Just the food only?
[873.01] Ahhh the sentiments are flying already eh?
[875.70] Come here my beautiful heroine.
[877.15] Oh God!
[879.28] These big biceps of yours!
[880.81] Can’t help them, they’re just too big.
[884.33] By the way, is it that necessary for you to move overseas?
[890.19] If I won’t go, then how would I be able to get you all a big house in a big city?
[895.88] It’s just that everyone really loves you here.
[900.40] Who’s in everyone?
[902.59] You dad.
[903.72] Oh forget it mom.
[904.67] No he really loves you.
[906.91] He doesn’t love me. If I wasn’t his biological son he would’ve surely murdered me someday.
[912.18] Bring the tea.
[914.97] Hear that, speak of the devil already.
[917.34] Okay just take these, it’s all ready. Go.
[919.76] Why should I serve these? I’m not getting a marriage proposal or anything.
[921.98] Who else should I ask?
[924.58] Bulla don’t have time.
[926.23] Bulla.. Don’t even know what he said.
[928.78] You’re speaking in English already?
[931.20] Because I’m heading to the UK you know.
[934.30] Bulla don’t.. I don’t know what.
[945.83]  Mr. Muzzafar doesn’t let go of any place in which he’s interested.
[951.57] And he will surely be displeased with your lack of cooperation.
[961.42] Yes. I can understand that. But the very day I wore this uniform, I made a promise and a commitment to myself.
[971.45] And that was that I will never resort to any means or dealings of dishonesty. That’s all.
[975.04] Tsk, tsk, tsk.
[977.67] Those honest one’s prides eventually cost them hard.
[985.29]   Honest people?
[989.68]  And they like to think that they are the only ones in the whole world full of honesty?
[995.65] Let me tell you Mr. Saleem. No one is this world is fully righteous.
[1004.41] Even after trying so hard, there are always loop holes and potentially loose ends.
[1010.54] You may play around with as many words and phrases as you please. What is wrong will always be wrong.
[1017.62] Your son wants to go to the UK.
[1025.10] Your daughter is studying right now and she’d want to continue her academics in the future as well.
[1030.73] You got your uniform already Mr. Saleem and you’ve worn it.
[1037.46]  Why don’t you take something for both of them? They’ll surely need it.
[1046.02] Not a chance. Not even till my last breath. Get it?
[1050.54] Alright.
[1053.21] I’ll take my leave then.
[1056.67] At least have your tea?
[1062.55] Maybe some other time.
[1066.77] If we live till then..
[1070.00] Okay then. Take care.
[1095.91] Why are you so late?
[1098.49] The guest has left already.
[1101.09] And you’re still standing there holding the tea tray. All good?
[1105.41] Why don’t you speak up?
[1106.84] This?
[1108.54]  
Is this your love for me?
[1110.54] Everything is a lie. It’s nonsense.
[1112.54] Bulla! Bulla?
[1116.08] Parents even sacrifice their lives for their children.
[1118.48] But look at him!
He can’t even take a small amount of bribe for us.
[1121.21] Stop it.
[1122.11] Are we even his own offsprings or not?
[1123.13] Just stop it!
[1124.00] No
[1125.81] This person is never going to let us succeed in life!
[1129.42] Forget going to the UK, I’m sure he won’t even be able to afford Areeba’s wedding expenses in the future.
[1134.68] Enough Bulla. Just stop it.
[1135.76] No mom no.
[1142.53] It would’ve been much better
[1144.08] if we didn’t have a father at all in your place.
[1146.04] Bulla!
[1237.11] Bulla!
[1262.09] He could’ve taken the money mom.
[1264.92] Then I wouldn’t have to indulge in these pathetic labor works.
[1267.55] We could’ve got settled.
[1269.14] Yeah right settled!
[1273.42] Do you know how long he has served in the police department?
[1278.28] And during all this time how many people have already tried to bribe him?
[1285.88] Why didn’t he ever take it? Why?
[1288.76] Because he is a selfless man!
[1292.85] Selflessness often turns into selfishness mom.
[1299.18] You seem pretty selfish to me in this moment.
[1306.38] Listen to me.
[1309.21] Just because you wanted that, why would’ve he taken the bribe?
[1314.14] He has never fallen prey to such things.
[1316.46] You own loved ones are your strength. Not your weakness.
[1322.71] By the way, those were some harsh words you said to your father.
[1331.97] That really hurt him.
[1334.38] He’s angry with you.
[1335.76] Okay mom, just don’t get all sentimental now.
[1341.89] I’ll go to him.
[1343.72] But only because of you.
[1349.09] Go to him.
[1350.37]  Go wake him up for morning prayers.
[1352.79] Hang on.
[1354.79] When was the last time that you offered your prayers?
[1357.14] I just offered the congregational prayers a couple of days ago.
[1358.65] Way to go son. Two day ago right?
[1360.65]  It’s time for morning prayers, go get ready for them.
[1363.04] Why are you wearing an earring?
[1365.43] It’s my style mom.
[1368.18] It’s my SWAG, SWAG. You won’t get it.
[1371.04] SWAG? What in the world is that?
[1448.94] Hello sir.
[1452.33] Hello sir.
[1455.24] I’m really sorry about your father’s loss.
[1457.96] He was a really nice person.
[1460.33] May God bless his soul.
[1464.62] It’s all upon the Creator’s will.
[1467.17] Anyways, this is the bill of the all of the stuff that was arranged.
[1471.82] I’d be grateful if you can pay it now so that I can leave on time.
[1482.53] Thank you.
[1485.59] Thanks a lot sir.
[1487.96] I’ll pray for your father. God bless his soul.
[1515.84] What is this mom?
[1519.39] Ever since the past five years, a little by little,
[1528.97] this is what your father was trying to save for you.
[1537.92]  So that you could go overseas.
[1542.34] What?
[1544.70] The love of a father and son is way bigger than a mere point of view.
[1551.33] You’re the head of this family now Bulla.
[1558.19] You’re all who’s left now.
[1564.14] Do whatever that you wish.
[1571.52] Whatever that you want.
[1611.36] Bulla I heard about your father’s demise. I’m really sorry for your loss.
[1617.18] Everything just happened so quickly.
[1623.30] What happened to your father?
[1628.44] Okay listen.
[1632.76] I know this isn’t the appropriate time to ask this
[1637.58] but what will become of us now?
[1641.16] What do you mean?
[1644.27] I mean that I’m getting proposals at my home for marriage Bulla.
[1646.99] I have to give an answer, so I need to know where we’re heading towards now?
[1654.46] This really isn’t the feasible time to talk about it.
[1656.92] So when will that time arrive Bulla?
[1665.22] My dad has grounded me already, he keeps questioning me daily.
[1671.97] He pressurizes me and I can’t hold it off for long.
[1676.57] And now you’ve even called off from going to the UK, since you’ve taken the responsibility of your mother and sister.
[1682.11] If this doesn’t change,
[1684.41] then I’m afraid we won’t be able to go along ahead.
[1688.58] Just give it a thought.
[1693.75] I’m getting late, I have to go.
[1787.87] Oh not a problem Mr. Chaudhary.
[1793.76] I came to collect a few of my father’s belongings..
[1814.17] I heard about your father. I’m really sorry for your loss.
[1819.42] He was an honest man.
[1825.26] When are you going to the UK?
[1836.16] If you want to make your way around this world,
[1840.00]  you only need one thing.
[1845.43] Cash. Money.
[1849.75] For going to the UK,
[1851.75] for buying a house
[1856.49] or for silencing someone.
[1862.27] I’m sure you’ve understood what I was trying to tell you.
[1867.73] Money makes it all happen.
[1888.50] Have a seat son.
[1900.29] I’m really sorry for your father’s loss.
[1904.63] He was a very honest man.
[1907.11]  A pious religious person.
[1909.92] May God grant him paradise. Amen.
[1914.41] What happened to him?
[1915.78] How much did you take?
[1919.08] Look Bulla. These are very powerful people.
[1924.29] I can’t challenge them.
[1926.94] I’m quite helpless, I have my own responsibilities to fulfil.
[1936.15] Here’s a brotherly advice for you. Take up your father’s post.
[1941.63] Look I know, I understand that it was never your ambition to join the police force.
[1947.29] But give it a good clear thought.
[1949.29]  You’re an educated person.
[1950.97]  You’ll get promoted in no time.
[1954.58] And your mother and sister need you.
[1958.22] If you work with the required manner, then both money and power will be in your hands.
[1964.00] Bulla nothing in this world functions without money.
[1966.59] If you’ve got money then you’ve got everything.
[1969.57] Just give it a thought using a cool head. What do you say?
[1993.22] V.O (If this doesn’t change, then I’m afraid we won’t be able to go along ahead)
[2011.64] V.O (You’re the head of this family now Bulla.
[2015.01]  V.O (You’re all who’s left now. Do whatever that you wish.)
[2020.58] V.O (If you want to make your way around in this world
[2025.48] you only need one thing
[2027.06] V.O (If you work with the required manner, then both money and power will be in your hands.)
[2031.34] V.O (Cash. Money.)
