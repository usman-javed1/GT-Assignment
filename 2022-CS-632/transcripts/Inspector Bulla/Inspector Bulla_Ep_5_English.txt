Mohsin. Ye sir?  What’s this story? Sir this is Nasreen. She steals the ladies handbags during the day. And those too the branded ones. She’s hasn’t been caught yet. By the way.. Do you know her sir? Sorry sir. Oh no no aunty there’s no need for being any more courteous, I’ll take my leave now. Oh no son, you’re my son’s friend. I won’t let you leave without you having dinner. Sit down, you won’t leave unless you have dinner. I’m going to serve food to you anyway. I’ll bring something for you. Okay then.. Bring something. Oh my.. What are you doing here? Son.. Mom he.. He’s your friend. Is that how you treat friends? Oh no aunty, we are just like this. Two bodies, but one soul. In fact, two bodies but same underwear. I’ll leave now. Kindly allow me. No no I’m going to bring some food. Yeah as if I’ll let you leave. Now that you’re here make sure you leave after having food. Underwear friend, I’ll surely rip your underwear off now. I won’t be able to digest this food. Eat up son. Have some more.  Make sure you maintain your health. No aunty, I’m on a “kitty” diet these days. Grass roots and wheat grains only. What? Are you a rabbit now? You may consider me as one. By the way didn’t we  have to meet outside today? Oh yes. I just came here to see whether you came back home or not.  That’s all I saw a man peeking through the door.  When I went to look, I found it was him. So I brought him inside. Mom please don’t go outside just like that. What if it had been a thief or a robber? Why don’t you advise her? If you’re that concerned then don’t you come back home early yourself? Areeba! What did they teach you at the college today?
  Mom we studied history today.  They taught us so much that I started to feel sleepy. Bulla what did you do today? I worked on something to make our lives easier. And how would that be? Do you want to ask me everything? Why don’t you ask her something? Someone asked me to keep an eye on you. What? Oh my! Mom do you see this? Bro asked him to keep an eye on me. Just because I’ve started to come and go alone? Will you treat me like this now bro? Thank you uncle.  I mean uhh bro. If you hadn’t told me I would’ve never known. Bulla this isn’t fair. So wrong so wrong. Mom you won’t take his side. No I won’t let you side with him. No what is this? What is it? Here look. Look what’s written. I loved the food.  Now I have two moms. Mine’s “Amma” and you’re “Mamma”. I’ll keep coming from now.  For sure. Bye. Com here. Take it easy. Stand here. Are you crazy? Don’t come to my home like this from now on. I was concerned about you.  Concerned yeah right. It was so tension. Thoughts, gas, air in the tummy.  Strange noises. I thought unless I go and see you for myself I won’t be able to have any satisfaction. Your mom has a strong consciousness. So someone has asked to keep eyes on me? That’s what I’ve heard. That’s what I’ve heard. Mr. Shah just doesn’t trust anyone like this. Eyes will be kept on you. You need to be cautious.  For real. Thank you. Oh come.  There’s no need for it.  I am obliged to your favors. It’s the first time I’ve seen my mom so happy. Just like how I always wanted to see her. Take care. You better leave now. I’ll leave now. It’s a love you. Showoff. Oh did he nick my money?  Where’s my wallet? Saved. Who is it? So are you the new officer around here son? Yes madam. Inspector Bulla. There were some complaints regarding this land of yours. Ye son, I’ve come across a lot of complaints regarding this. But they don’t seem to resolve.  And I can’t keep on attending anymore court sessions. Do you live alone here? No not alone. My grand-daughter lives with me.  She’s asleep right now. Anyways you tell me what is the problem here? The issue is that this land is legally registered on my grand-daughter’s name. And until she doesn’t come of age, I’ll have to look after this land. Some people came over here a few days ago.  They threatened us. Then why don’t you sell this land? How can I sell it?  I’ve lived here since my childhood. I’ll surely leave from here after I die. Don’t you worry. I’ll take care of all of your tensions.  I’ll deal with legal and court frameworks. Just sign these papers.  And leave the rest to your son here. Really? I’m so glad that the world still holds such people like yourself.  Where do I sign? Right here. Okay fine. Thank you madam.  I’ll leave now. May you always be happy. Bless you. Thank you for waiting Maham. But the meeting with the MNA turned out to be the same lengthy one as always. It’s totally alright. I can understand that you’re always busy. Yeah mostly in the insurance and maintenance of this place.  Not much other than this. How can I help you? I collected some posts and data. And made my mark around those numbers.  Take a look? Sure. Sure. Impressive. This is really good. Really good. Really? So that’s it. I’ll start making my presentation for the final financial approval. Right away. Yes. I’ll go through this until then. And I’ll also have a word about this with the MNA. Sure. Take your time. And let’s get this done. Okay.  Thank you. Thank you Maham. And keep up the good work. Yes? What’s this blockade of yours? You don’t know sir. What? You’ve been promoted sir. You’ve been appointed as the temporary SHO.  Sir Congratulations. Now everything will function according to you. Hello? I never disappoint those, who don’t disappoint me. Thank you Mr. Shah. Just keep on making me happy like this.  And I’ll keep making you happy in return. Oh kill him sir.  Wow wow. Fire. Fire. Yes! You’re playing awesome. Stop you! Speeding your way eh? Take a look at him sir. He’s wandering around without a helmet. Where are your vehicle registration papers? Speak up! He’s dumb and deaf sir. Okay let him go. Are you playing the free fire one? Yes It’s an awesome game sir. Isn’t it? Amazing. Hey you! He’s booyahed you. It’s a bad day today. Sir there’s a car approaching. A branded one. Pull down the window. Sir it’s Bilal Saeed. Sir  He’s my favorite singer sir. Sir the tea has spilled and the closet has opened. Alright.. Such tall walls and such high class cars eh? Inspector Bulla right? Such an interesting name of yours. And so is my character. That’s hard. Really hard. Got no company today? Sir.  The company is actually calling me since quite a while now, if you’d let me reach her? I can then drop my CV to her. Putting the pressure on us then eh? Alright. Okay. Just  Don’t forget to keep treating us. No tension sir. The treat just always slips from my own hand. We’ll keep seeing each other. For sure. Let him through. I’m actually enjoying our blockade today sir. Let’s trap someone else. Hello. I know. I know. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Exactly ten minutes late. What can i do.. You know there’s so much going on these days.. Actually I’ve been promoted to the SHO post. What? Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Wow.  You’ve already ordered everything beforehand. If you’ll be that late, I’ll have to take care of this. Do you need anything else sir? Yes just bring the bill. You must be really worthy That’s why you’ve been promoted so early. Ahh what can I say? Just the hard work I guess.  Really hard working traits. Anyways what’s the update on your app? The app requires a lot of work.  It’s still in its research phase. But there’s surely one thing. Ehitsham’s organization is really helping me so much. Yeah Ehtisham.  He has a lot of influence for sure. Exactly.  You also noticed that right?  Me too. People really think so high of him.  And he’s such a nice person on the whole. Whenever you come across him, you’ll always find him helping someone. You seem really close to him. What? You’re getting jealous right? Jealous? And me? No no. There’s nothing like that at all. There's no such thing but still if you need any help.. I’m a SHO now so.. Yes you’ve mentioned it already. That you’re an SHO now. By the way Ehtisham is only helping me but strictly professionally. It’s nothing more than that. Oh no no. There’s nothing like that in my mind. Don’t worry. Relax. I accept. But Thanks for clearing though. Madam here’s your bill. Hey hand that over to me. I know madam doesn’t accept favors. Definitely. Here you go. What are you doing? You said it yourself.  Split the bill in half. Is that how you divide the bill? I’m learning. I’m learning how to do it. Anyways.  Let’s eat. Oh no no sir. We are still indebted towards you Mr. Chaudhary.  No no I’ll handle it myself. Oh it’s not a problem at all. Yeah. Sir it’s behind your ear. Thank you. Name? Azaan. Full name? Azaan Malik. Azaan Malik. And the jewelry which got stolen  Was it original or a fake? Sir it was made of gold. Inside my “daizigner” bag. Original. Okay Mr. Azaan Malik.  I’ve written it down here. We’ll see what we can do about it. Sir. Make sure you handle their case on a priority basis. Sure sir. Now tell me. I think this theft has been performed by a professional. Wow Bulla.  You’ve become a great officer. Bulla whatever happened before, I really regret it. Whatever you wanted you got it. Your case will be solved soon. Take care. Bulla? Who’s wedding are you returning from? My marriage has been fixed. Here have some sweets. Wow. Seems like you’ve caught a train. Yes yes it’s been fixed finally. Just like the “Pindi Express”. The girl’s family visited us today. Only ‘Gulab Jamans” but no “Barfi”? It’s a really expensive world these days.  Hey.  Are you smoking weed? Oh just sometimes. Not much. Listen to me.  You’re about to get married, your mom’s all alone. These habits don’t suit you anymore. Oh no I’ll surely quit it from now. My to be bride hates smoking overall. I thought if that’s the case, then I’ll only puff on joss sticks from now on. Ah forget it. Is this going to be a love marriage of yours? Oh we’ve been in love since a long time now. The marriage arrangement has been fixed through your support. I’ll surely celebrate my marriage with full dances. I’ll get the streets decorated, have songs being played throughout like “Ah lare eeyy”. Full enjoyment. Just don’t pick-pocket your in laws please. Oh I’ve checked their pockets already. They are all empty. You naughty idiot! Unemployed people they are.  And they were asking me for a loan. Give me the sweets. Let me eat as well. Such a big mouth of yours. If you share the same bite then it means you’re more bonded together. How much more bonding do you want now? You even get sick because of it. You’re a sickness yourself. Yeah. Any tip for my marriage? Should I start consuming dry fruits from now? You’re here already? Yes. Are you excited? Yes sir. What’s with the sir sir? You’re going on a special dinner. You’ll come across a lot of important people there.  They should know that you’re my special guy. Here. If anything gets spoiled you never clean it. You just change it. Go sit in the car, I’ll join you in a bit. Sorry Mr. Shah, I got a bit late. No no you go and rest. There’s already so much work load on you. Go and rest. Oh no Mr. Shah I’ll come along please. If you say another word I’ll throw you in this flame! You should’ve stayed within your limits Bulla! Should’ve stayed within your limits, you haven’t been fair in this! Does he think he can just come in like this and take my place? Everyone surely has some sort of a weakness. Figure out his weakness. Find out his weakness.
