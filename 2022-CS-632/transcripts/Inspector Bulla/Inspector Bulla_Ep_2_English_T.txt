[23.24] You’re leaving us.
[25.87] Let him go. 
[27.43] It’s understandable
[29.32] Just don’t forget us after moving to the city.
 
[35.18] How can I ever forget you lunatics?
[120.48] New city, 
[123.13] New people 
[126.00] and new challenges
[131.31] Oh Bulla

[247.71] Areeba hasn’t woken up yet
[249.09] I don’t why she’s sleeping for so long.
[254.82] Look mom.
[257.67] Mom listen.
[266.01] Death leaves a bitter impression mom.
[268.64] And life has even worse.
[272.27] Yet we still have to live it through.
[277.00] Areeba will now go to college. 
[278.76] I will go to the police station.
 
[281.29] But you?
[287.09] We have to change.
[291.31]  All of us together.
[298.37] Seems like you’ve become mature.
[301.93] I’ve matured since quite a while. 
[304.89]  You just got to know it now.
[307.59] Naughty boy.
[309.55] The name’s Inspector Bulla.
[315.60] And this is my station!
[319.15] Constable Mohsin reporting sir!
[322.64] Hey.. 
[324.00] What is this?
[325.42] This is the Gulab Town Station sir.
[329.29] That’s okay, but what is its condition?
[332.33] The condition is a bit off
[335.16] But if you can ignore a few things
[337.38] then the scene is quite okay sir.
 
 
[345.76] Come on sir, let me give you a tour of the station.
[355.35] Sit down, sit down.
[356.84] what is this state of the station?
 
[360.92] It's just mess all around
[367.32] Slow down.
[373.85] Sir!
[374.85] Yeah Mohsin, has the senior officer arrived?
[377.25] Yes sir is inside.
[413.72] Inspector Bulla.
[414.60] Sir!...Welcome. 
[416.50]  How was your journey?
[418.31] The journey was fine, but 
[420.50] What is this state of the station?
 
[422.09] We’ve submitted the application for such funds since so many years.
[425.44] Who’s desk is that?
[426.24] ASI Jamshaid Asad.
[427.90] Why isn’t he here yet?
[428.79] He’s usually late.
[429.94] Provided if he comes.
[433.09] Isn’t he conscious of losing his job?
[434.47] Oh sir he’s a special recruit by the SHO. Get an idea from that.
[437.64] Who else is around here?
[438.78] Sir constable Mohsin.
[439.83] Sir!
[440.57] Me, ASI Jamshaid, Sohail the clerk and the rest of all are random constables and moving insects. That’s all.
[446.39] And what about the SHO?
[451.55] Sir we’ve stopped asking about such a thing since more than a year now.
[454.45] Anyways. Welcome to the Gulab Town Police Station sir!
[507.25] Hands up!
[512.10] Mom come on.
[514.44] Come here, come quick.
[522.51] At least keep the door locked.
[524.99] What difference does it make?
[526.51] We used to keep it open in the village.
[529.02] This isn’t the village anymore, we’re in the city now.
[531.47] Nobody enters without permission here.
[534.74] They ring the bell, the bell.
[539.06] My name is Bulla
[543.76] What is this commotion? Please turn it off.
[547.43] At least something’s happening.
[549.39] Otherwise it’s pin drop silence all day long.
[551.59] No noise, no one to hear, no one to talk to.
[554.72] At least I’m hearing something.
[556.27] Where is Areeba?
[558.83] She’s in her room. She’s angry with you.
[562.05] Why?
[564.15] Go and ask her yourself.
[565.53] Mom tell me!
[573.78] She feels that your father died because of the troubles and miseries you caused him.
[582.49] It’s alright son.
[584.45] Everything will be just fine, don’t you worry.
[590.77] What have you brought?
[594.27] I got her admitted in college
[596.94]  So I brought her new uniform.
[599.33] Wow. 
[600.26] Go give it to her. Go on, go give it to her.
 
[614.12] Areeba
[621.10] I know you’re awake.
[624.64] I brought you your new uniform.
[635.32] I’ve got you admitted into college.
[643.15] Be ready in the morning.

[784.61] Whatever else that we consume, he doesn’t have any issue with it sir.
[788.21] He’s rare to see around, but he has a great heart sir.
[794.86] From this day onwards..
[796.96] First of all we’ll consume.
[799.98] And after that.

[846.48] Sir the SHO has called you over to his place.

[864.61] Mom cancel the order for the food.
[888.78] So you’re Inspector Bulla.
[892.12] Sir!
[906.00] I heard that you teared up my memo.
[914.25] I’ve come across a lot of you old school rural folks.
[917.24] Who think they can make a difference in the status quo.
[918.52] Who think they change the culture of the stations and the whole country.
[921.00] But to no avail.
[922.56] Everything functions around here with my own consent and will.
[929.29] I’ll throw you out.
[931.97] I’m elder than you.
[934.28] And you should listen to your elders.
[938.06] Hasn’t your father taught you anything?
[945.18] What did you say?
[946.35] Umm nothing.
[947.50] Father what?
[948.41] Nothing. Don’t you want some tea? 
[950.41] Serve us some tea!
[958.62] What I meant was that you and I are going to head the station together.
[963.20] So I just wanted to discuss some stuff and take suggestions.
[973.34] Who told you that i've come here to promote honesty
[976.77] Corruption will strive. 
[978.91] But only according to my own terms.
[981.13] You don’t need to come to the station. You’ll get your shares.
[986.61] But here’s the thing. 
[988.84] The station will only function according to my own terms
[994.05] What do you say?
[1000.71] Right you are. That station will function according to your own terms.
[1012.55] Hmm the apple is quite delicious.
[1014.00] Yes, just like your statements.
[1016.54] But I say. The memo that I sent regarding the itinerary. 
[1019.67] The Microwave, the kid’s school fees, clothes and etc. If I could just have those you know?
[1026.89] Bless you. Your uniform looks really charming on you.
[1031.33] I'll take my leave
[1061.82] Mohsin!
[1063.85]  Mohsin!
[1079.33] Hello sir.
[1083.61] Whom are you looking for sir? You can’t find anyone around here.
[1087.19] Everyone hide themselves after seeing me.
[1089.98] Hide themselves? Why?
[1093.12] I don’t know.
[1095.03] They don’t even register my report sir.
[1097.24] I have a case of “missing” sir. Kindly help me out with it.
[1100.60] He’s lying sir. You shouldn’t believe him at all sir.
[1105.13] Hey you! Get out of here! Can’t you hear me?
[1107.53] He’s the biggest liar of the century sir.
[1109.20] I’m telling you to get up and buzz the hell out of here!
[1112.07] Get out of here. Are you deaf or what?
[1114.44] Silence!
[1117.03] What the hell are you guys up to?
[1119.35] He has a “missing” case.
[1121.59] Is this a police station or a mental institute?
[1126.96] Don’t you worry. I’ll register your case.
[1130.76] Thank you sir. You’re so kind enough.
[1138.91] It’s a report regarding ‘missing’.
[1141.61] Who is missing?
[1142.96] My rooster.
[1152.00] Okay, so you’re rooster is missing.
[1157.10] Since when?
[1159.75] It’s been a week now. 
[1161.98] I searched for him so much, but he’s nowhere to be found.
[1164.26] We’ll find him, we’ll find him for sure.
[1166.97] Now tell me, where was the last place that you saw him at?
[1170.04] On a parapet of a wall.
[1176.15] On the parapet of a wall.
[1179.85] How does your rooster look?
[1182.00] On a parapet every rooster is a white colored one.
[1186.57] There is a white rooster on the parapet of the wall.
[1192.00] Silence!
[1193.58] Take this crazy rooster guy away from here!
[1195.58] Get lost!
[1196.45] Sir I told you before. Get up you..
[1202.51] I’ll bring the revolution of the roosters!
[1204.96] I’ll bring the revolution of the roosters!
[1206.38] Get him out of here!
[1209.85] Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution!
[1217.07] Don’t let him come back!
[1221.80] Screw his rooster!
[1226.32] And what I wanted to join the police force!
[1253.86] How’s it going?
[1256.18] Seems like I’m a bit early.
[1258.25] Aren’t you free yet?
[1260.24] You’re exactly an hour late!
[1264.96] Thank you for meeting me sir.
[1267.06] I’ll need your data base for the app that I’m trying to develop.
[1270.70] Areeba!
[1271.70] Listen to me.. What’s wrong?
[1273.49] You’re asking me what’s wrong?
[1275.37] You don’t even have any idea about the sort of fanatics I’m coming across at the police station. And then the worse traffic of this city.
[1280.92] Bro you do know that I’m pissed off right?
[1282.92] No no please. Please don’t be angry.
[1285.67] See I’ve brought you something.
[1287.34] Don’t worry sir. I’ll sort out the whole files and folders myself. 
[1290.63] And you’ll not regret this decision of yours.
[1292.63] Ready? Ready?
[1298.95] Take a look at it.
[1301.05] It’s like one in a million stupid.
[1302.26] Bro stop teasing me please.
[1303.89] Look.. Look
[1305.89]  I swear you look like “Madhuballa”
[1307.52] Bro stop teasing me please.
[1310.30] I know. I know you’re blushing. I know that.
[1312.91] There’s no way I’m blushing. I’m still pissed off.
[1344.75] Bro
[1346.20] Shame on you!
[1347.96] For standing outside a girls school and harassing a young girl.
[1350.37] And that too while being in your uniform?
[1362.25] Take a look at her age and then figure out your own!
[1364.35] No, no, no. 
[1365.79] He’s my brother.
[1370.19] Brother?
[1377.61] So.. You should leave early then. Why are you standing here?
[1389.52] Brother?
 
[1390.93] Brother..
[1394.07] Shall we leave?
[1400.84] Come on
