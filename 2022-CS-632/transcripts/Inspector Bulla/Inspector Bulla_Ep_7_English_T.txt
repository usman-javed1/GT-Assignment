[10.40] It’s my wedding but instead you
seem to be tensed.
[13.74] What happened?
[16.16] Nothing.
[16.83] Something’s wrong.
[18.26] Ever since you’re here you
haven’t even talked nor you’ve
[21.06] even told me off from anything.
[22.46] You haven’t even abused me.
[25.47] Something’s definitely up
that’s what I’m sure about.
[28.70] Tell me something.
[29.82] What?
[31.60] Am I bad person?
[32.70] Who said that to you?
[34.69] Tell me.
[35.55] I don’t know about being good
or bad.
[37.50] But my life has surely changed
because of you.
[40.51] I’ve left the wrong ways.
[42.41] My mom is happy because of me.
[45.16] So someone like you can’t be a
bad person.
[47.92] That’s what I’m sure about.
[49.90] Something’s wrong.
[52.31] Look at me.
[54.09] Did you have a fight with your
girl?
[55.80] How do you know?
[57.26] Because I behave in the same
way when I fight with my girl.
[63.68] You’re fighting just before
being married?
[65.34] Oh yes daily.
[66.92] She texts me with why I haven’t
greeted her with a good morning?
[69.05] I respond with why can’t you
wish me yourself?
[71.92] It’s not compulsory for me only.
[72.99] We fight daily. And we get
normal together.
[75.11] So who compromises you or her?
[76.68] I have to be the one who has to
mend everything.
[81.52] How?
[82.42] By begging.
[83.62] Begging heavily.
[85.71] I just don’t leave any space. I
just keep texting with endless
[88.00] texts of sorry.
[89.15] I tell her that you’re standing
on the edge and I’m drowning.
[92.94] And I’m probably going to die.
[94.92] Yes...
[95.48] What?
[96.29] But you don’t have to do this.
[97.88] All you have to do is apologize
once from your heart.
[100.88] What if she doesn’t accept it?
[101.92] Then you have to apologize
again. There isn’t any rocket
[104.04] science in it.
[106.08] You just have to beg and beg.
[109.17] Hold her legs or something.
Grab her feet.
[111.42] With every simplicity just be
stubborn about it. And she’ll
[114.07] agree.
[115.54] Just like that.
[117.07] Just keep smiling like this.
[120.29] Sadness doesn’t suit you at all.
[122.88] Thank you.
[125.04] And when she agrees, do tell
her about me as well. That it
[127.65] was my idea.
[129.55] I’ll let her know for sure. In
fact I’ll make her meet you.
[132.44] When you’d want to introduce me
let me know a day before. I’ll
[134.40] make sure that I groom myself
properly.
[136.36] Shave myself decently and be
presentable
[138.76] Full..
[139.07] You’re a big film you know that?
[140.22] And a top one.
[142.28] I’m way bigger than “Kuch Kuch
Hota Hai” film.
[144.48] I know a lot happens to you.
[189.78] Maham can you hand me that last
week’s survey file?
[206.11] What’s up?
[207.26] Why are you so silent today?
[208.75] Not really. There’s nothing
like that.
[211.63] Are you sure?
[215.06] Are you trying to say that you
aren’t distracted?
[218.49] Why are you asking me again and
again?
[219.94] Good.
[220.71] Very Good.
[221.81] Because I... didn’t ask for
this file.
[231.02] What is Bulla’s problem?
[233.19] On one hand he listens to
everything I say.
[235.50] And on the other side he
becomes so stubborn that he
[237.83] doesn’t even accept anything.
[239.21] This is so frustrating.
[241.26] You cannot even imagine.
[242.75] Listen these things often tend
to happen in relationships.
[245.44] Don’t worry.
[246.30] This isn’t a “let go” thing.
[248.88] Look.
[249.65] We caught the drug dealer.
[251.29] He named “Shah” as responsible.
[252.68] And Bulla let him go.
[255.29] Now you tell me yourself he
isn’t a coward right?
[257.38] How can he let him go unless he
is hiding something from me?
[261.27] Look. It’s his job to keep a
look out on such people.
[264.32] You need to trust him in such a
situation
[267.11] And he’ll eventually figure out
a way to this. You should relax.
[270.75] Now I’ll only relax after Shah
gets caught.
[273.86] What?
[275.81] You’ll get Shah caught?
[277.82] Am I not capable enough for
that?
[279.74] You Maham..
[281.20] You can do everything.
[282.20] Anyways.
[283.70] If you need my help in this
case in any way just let me know.
[287.04] Thank you.
[288.18] It means a lot to me.
[289.33] You’re welcome.
[291.12] Kindly hand me the right file
this time please.
[296.84] Thank you.
[305.94] A five.
[310.03] Take your turn quickly.
[311.32] Either way I’m winning.
[313.15] Yeah right you’re winning.
[319.06] Here’s a five.
[320.34] I see.
[321.45] My turn.
[324.85] Hello?
[329.97] This time? Why?
[336.23] Okay I’m coming.
[340.12] Take your turn quickly.
[341.35] Have some patience.
[343.65] Oh wow ice cream.
[346.61] Win this now.
[347.25] Bro!
[362.51] Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[367.05] Mr. Bulla.
[370.43] Where’s Shah?
[371.68] Don’t you know?
[373.49] You’re more closer to him than
me these days.
[377.80] Quit messing around, come to
the point.
[382.63] Mr. Shah didn’t come but he did
arrange a special task for you.
[386.78] What?
[387.73] A couple of guys have robbed
the factory.
[391.65] And Mr. Shah only has one
principle.
[393.80] The penalty for theft is
[395.92] Murder.
[396.58] I’m not going to murder anyone.
[401.73] You’re not even up to it I know
that.
[406.38] Leave that to me. Don’t worry.
[423.10] Water.
[426.27] Water.
[429.49] Give me some water.
[431.24] What happened?
[433.88] Do you know him?
[438.10] No.
[439.95] I mean..
[442.23] I saw him at the station.
[444.69] He’s just a pick-pocketer.
[446.93] So you...
[448.62] Don’t have any personal
affiliations with him right?
[452.82] No.
[455.11] Right, right, right.
[458.76] Had he stuck to those small
petty thefts
[461.59] He would’ve lived.
[463.42] This freak has directly grabbed
the hand of death.
[468.70] Listen hand him over to me,
I’ll deal with him myself..
[470.49] No Mr. Bulla no....
[474.49] No Mr. Bulla this isn’t your
task.
[477.80] This is my responsibility.
[480.30] You have some other work to
attend to.
[482.28] Right?
[484.81] Have you ever encountered
someone Mr. Bulla?
[491.80] Encounter?
[496.65] You’re just a new crop in the
field what would you know
[499.24] anything about an encounter?
[502.46] But if you have to go along
with us
[504.18] For long term ....
[506.09] Then you’ll have learn such a
work.
[508.83] Don’t worry.
[510.91] I’ll teach you.
[513.17] After killing a man you have to
dispose his body like..
[526.24] The poor chap is feeling the
pain..
[530.22] Forget him.
[531.92] Listen to me.
[536.46] After killing someone you have
made the dead body seem like as
[538.46] if that person died during an
encounter.
[541.94] You have fire twice in his back
and not a single bullet in the
[544.19] front.
[546.99] So that it may seem in the
report that he was shot while
[549.63] running away.
[552.04] Right?
[563.10] Bulla?
[564.63] Are you listening Bulla?
[566.50] Bulla!
[568.97] Are you listening?
[570.66] What’s wrong?
[572.73] Are you alright?
[578.12] You’re witnessing something
like this for the first time
[579.82] that’s why you feel lost right?
[582.29] Don’t worry.
[583.72] You don’t need to feel anxious.
[585.95] You’ll get the hang of it next
time.
[587.43] It’s happened for the first
time in fornt of you.
[588.79] Go now.
[591.03] Go.
[595.39] Hello Mr. Shah.
[598.20] Yes Mr. Shah I’ve explained
everything to Bulla.
[601.33] It’s probably his first time
that’s why he's a bit scared.
[604.49] Yes Mr. Shah.
[605.25] Yes yes.
[607.11] He was just scared.
[614.50] But that’s okay, we’ve taught
him well.
[618.37] Don’t you worry.
[619.57] He’ll remember for sure.
[621.25] Yes. Okay. Okay.
[624.17] Oh pick up his dead body
already or do you want to take
[625.72] a selfie with it?
[627.60] Dispose of it.
[629.70] Clean this up.
[720.36] Hello?
[721.31] Yes Ehtisham I was looking at
some of the orphanage files and
[724.24] I found a few flaws in them.
[729.65] Flaws?
[731.16] What sort of flaws?
[732.73] I can’t tell you like this.
Let’s meet at the office
[734.41] tomorrow then I’ll explain to
you.
[736.42] Yes yes sure.

[836.92] I’ll teach him a lesson.
[838.76] Son.
[841.23] Son you know what?
[842.51] Where ever Jamshaid may wander,
he always comes back home
[844.70] before night.
[846.23] You aren't saying anything?
[847.68] Where is he?
[853.90] Is he...
[855.14] Is he alright son?

[879.19] What are you saying?
[880.45] You’re lying.
[883.28] Go bring him.
[884.98] He used to consider you as his
elder brother.
[887.41] You were like an elder brother
to him.
[890.16] Where were you at that time?
[891.61] Where were you?
[893.55] Where were you?
[895.36] Go somewhere and bring him back.

quiet tonight.
[915.82] Sir I suggest you to have a
peck anyhow tonight.
[918.40] Hey what if sir smacks you
instead of it?
[923.35] Grab your senses.
[924.97] Sir
[926.10] The elders say that when the
weight increases
[929.61] It’s better to share it.
[931.60] As one can even fall down
because of heavy weights.
[934.70] Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
[937.32] I didn’t understand.
[958.58] Sir?
[967.40] Back already son?
