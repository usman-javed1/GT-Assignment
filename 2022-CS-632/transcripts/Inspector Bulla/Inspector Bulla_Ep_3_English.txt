Hey. So you guys chill while drinking as well eh? Of course sir Join us please Sir Sir.. Although I don’t drink but that doesn’t mean I can’t join you guys. Pour some soda for sir. Without alcohol. By the way why don’t you guys quit drinking? Sir We resolute this every night before sleeping. Bu then forget everything when we wake up. Sir I have a question. Why did you get transferred from the village? I didn’t get transferred.  I came here with my own consent Destiny It’s a wonder how destiny shapes a man’s life. Not destiny... Money Money even tends to change destiny. Anyways Whom is the SHO affiliated with? These are high level dealings sir. Inferior guys like us don’t meddle in such affairs. Sir what would we know about us such dealings? All we do is follow the orders with “yes sir” “no sir”. And just survive on petty amounts of bribes. That’s why you’ve always been at a constable level. To reach the skies You’ve got to think high. Sir I can’t even understand a single word of yours. Your words are going over the top of my head.. That’s enough! Don’t give him anymore. He’s done. Now his glass.. Belongs to me. How long will you keep sulking? You do know  that your brother wanted to go overseas don’t you? And never to become a policeman. Why is he doing all of this? For us.. They both loved each other. Everybody has their own ways of expressing their love to each other. Those who have left us are gone forever. But those who are still here we need to take care of them.
  Boss are you playing “free fire”? Yes I have a platinum level. What’s yours?  I have the ‘heroic” level. Forget the game and keep your concentration on making the ‘gol gappas”. Make it quick. Just a moment boss. What do you think of them sir? These are better than the ‘dhahi bhallas” you treated me with. Sir I (Mohsin) made a promise to you that you’ll experience the most tastiest “gol gappas” of the whole city. Pour some more gravy. Oh my! “ayesha jatti 401” What’s that? Sir she’s a very famous tiktoker. Show me show me. How do I look? It’s a really cool snap. Na! I don’t like it at all. Excuse me? “Ayesha jatti 401”? Yeah. I watch a lot of your videos on tiktok.

I hope you aren’t in a hurry at the moment? Hey bro he’s still here. It seems like he can’t hear.  Can’t you hear me? Oh where did you smack your kick at? Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh.. Oh come on bring it. Come on get up. That’s a good boy. Please come here. Give her the phone. Yeah right there. Now get lost or do you want some more beating? Sorry Thank you brother. It really means a lot to me.

Coming sir. ‘ayesha jutti 40” whatever it is.  He’s a big fan of yours. Just grant him a selfie with yourself.
  Sure why not. Just  a second.Why don’t you join us in the photo as well? Sure Thank you. “Mohsin dilbar 411” Please do follow me. Malik Estate? Mr. Malik.  I’m heading your way. Look. An elevation is a really important factor. The entire look of your building, it’ll change, just transform beautifully. Ye sir otherwise there’s no such issue. Look Sir Sir, let me call you back in a while. I’ll explain everything in detail then. Another party just arrived Let me get back to you. Welcome, wow it’s been a while. Bless you. Look at that moustache. Do you oil it? Wonderful. I feel an introduction should be in order with this gentleman here? Introduce me. Inspector Bulla. Inspector Bulla. Wonderful.  Then this must mean that the previous one.. Never mind. Hey! Bring some refreshments for the guests here. Mr. Malik? I’ve heard that you’re hunting a lot of advance contractual payments these days. Oh yes of course! No.. No.. No.. I don’t hunt them. Advanced payments are received.It is a part of the deal you know. Who is saying such things to you? My reputation is at stake. This is a fake accusation sir. There have been a couple of complaints against you. Sir people have a habit of doing such things.  Because of being jealous If someone succeeds and makes money  then people tend to get insecure because of that attention. Please ignore such fake accusations. These are all lies. I feel  like you’re quite used to jails and courts. No no it’s nothing like that. Look Inspector “Bhollay”.. I mean Bulla. Mr. Bulla It’s not something that I’m fond of. The nature of my occupation compels me to indulge myself in such legal frameworks. I have to bear them. The term ‘bearing’ reminds me of something. Mohsin! Sir. What became of the ‘leather thrasher’ that we had ordered? Yes Has it been delivered? Sir we have received it  and they have guaranteed. That wherever it hits it’ll surely scrap off 2kgs of flesh! No.. No.. No..  Please don’t say things like that.
  I understand now. Let’s work with a compromise. What do you think? Look sir we have a lot of options. From Lahore to Gawadar Everything you touch will be yours Such as plots, shops, farmhouse, penthouse.. Even my house is your house sir. At your order sir. Whether it be construction or renovation, the whole city’s top projects are in my hands sir. I’m at your disposal sir. Mr. Malik isn’t that bad Mohsin. I told you before Sir.  Mr. Malik isn’t that bad at all. That’s right. There is one way. There is? Oh thank God! That’s great. Umm can we change the way of this little friend of yours? I feel uncomfortable and suffocated because of it. Go ahead sir. Just give me your order. Wow sir. You’ve done wonders. Now I’ll run the show with my own rules. Mom has sent some tea for you. When has mom started to send tea for me? That too in the middle of the night? How would I know?  Go and ask her yourself. Please forgive me now. Come on bro. Why are you apologizing? I’m sorry. By the way can I say something? The slap was spectacular. Please give me a loaf of bread and six eggs. Hey you! Are you blind or what? This is just great. How much do I owe you? Where’s my wallet? Sir what’s wrong?  Please gentle with me at least. Oho! How do you fire the guns? Bang! Bang! Bang! Here we have him again. Hey! Can’t you give it a break? Oh come on Tahir bro. I’m here for you. Coca Cola Pepsi, Tahir bro sexy. Muah. Way to go Tahir bro. Hey. Has he been here before as well? Someone grab him! We are so fed up of him sir! Oh Tahir bro don’t get so pissed off. I’m here to cheer you up and party with you! Come here you! Take out my money. Which money? Come here. Do you remember now? Your money is just worth three hundred rupees. But you delivered a slap worth one million dollars. Quit messing around with dialogues and give me my money! Hello. There’s a fight going on?...What can we do then? Hello. Fight? Where? We’re on our way. The station looks quite charming. Seems like you guys have invested some money here. Come here you! Hey sir, what are you doing sir? Sir this is my own money. Sir this is my own money. Who’s dollars are these? I won them as a prize. Take this. Put him behind bars and grant him a big prize! Come on.  Let me treat you with a hi-tea! Get moving! Don’t spoil my shirt.   What’s wrong?  Go easy on me. Come on, come on, come on move! So what’s going on here? I’m not sure. I think there’s a fight going on. I can see that for myself. Who are the ones who are fighting? It’s someone named Maqsood. What’s the reason behind it? Sir you’re the police officer yet you’re asking me about the reason? Come here. Buzz off, it’s time for your tuition. You too! It’s not your holiday today! Get going! Sir I suggest let’s leave it up to them. It’s more like daily basis thing for them.  We should head back to the station. Let’s go. Hey everyone! Look Ethisham is coming! Are you going to keep on fighting for the rest of your life now? Who is this Ehtisham? Ehtisham? Oh I remember. This is Ehtisham sir He supervises an orphanage around here.
  He’s quite famous around this neighborhood. Don’t both of you have anything else to do? What are you portraying in the public? Always quarrelling like children. Listen I don’t care. Whatever the issue is resolve it right now. Come on shake hands.. Stop this right now. Come on now. Okay everyone. Time to disperse. Seems like he’s taken care of our duty. I told you before sir. He’s quite famous around here and tends to resolves everything. V.O (Shame on you) Hey. Get on the bike. What’s wrong with this bike now? Push push come on hurry. Not me you idiot! The bike. Let’s go on foot. Hey listen! Hey listen! Why are you running? Stop please.. Hey stop, at least listen to me. Why are you running? Why are you following me? What have I done now? You haven’t done anything. In fact I wanted to apologize.  Now if you wave a flower around a girl like this way and then do it  and then do it while being in a police uniform. Then it seems more like to me that maybe you were trying to harass her or something. Look it was genuine mistake and I just want to apologize. I’m sorry. I’m Maham. Inspector Bulla. Nice to meet you Inspector Bulla. By the way I haven’t seen you around here before. He just recently got transferred. Oh I see. Nice.You know our system is so corrupt  but I’m sure you’re an honest officer. Anyways. I’m developing an app which will help those children living in the orphanage. For that I might be needing some data and statistics so I guess I’ll be seeing you around for this purpose. See you. Hey. What is this App Ddd.. App? Whatever it’s called. What is it? Oh sir you don’t know what’s an App Development? Actually App Development is something..   Which I don’t even know myself. Let’s ask him. What’s an App Development? Oh sir what would I know? You guys have been bothering me since morning whilst being police officers. I don’t even know why I stepped in to this neighborhood in the first place. Come here. Give this juice. Maybe we should head back to the station. This isn’t our day. Hello sir? At least serve some water to a poor guy like me? Oh you God fearing people! Even my kidneys must’ve dried up by now. I haven’t even peed since morning sir. Look over here. Not even been to the toilet once. Sir what life could guys like him possibly have? Pick-pocketing, eating stuff and then spending their whole life this like. They hold all sorts of information. Like who’s baby is born, who’s got divorced, who holds what sort of goods, they just seem to know it all. I see.. Oh please serve water to a poor guy like me.. Bring him out. Yes sir. One should have an air conditioner, a television set or even a girl inside in a jail. Even if one can’t even have these, at least give me some respect. Come on. Sir is calling you. Oh go easy on me. You know me since quite long ago. There’s a new officer in the station now. Things aren’t the way anymore like they were before. What’s that fragrance that you’ve put on? Sir Hey go easy on me.  What’s wrong with you? I’m a delicate person, sir please tell him. Should I leave sir? You may go. Sir! Since how long have you been stealing? Ever since I’ve had the burden of responsibilities. It goes back to 1987. When my father departed from this world during my childhood. I bare even remember his face. People ask me if I am Mr. Sufi’s son? I tell them that’s what I have heard because I’ve never even seen him Even when my mom shows me his photo.. Enough! Okay. I’ve heard that you hold lots of information and intel. Not information or intel, just some random facts and stuff. It’s not much. Work as an informer for me. Take this glass of water of yours back please. And this is my sincere excuse. No way. This is never happening. You may lock me up and keep me here. I’d rather die than ever do such a thing which you’re asking of me. Not happening. In today’s world of inflation You can’t even manage to survive on petty amounts of theft. Anyways. You may leave. You mean just leave? You should be sure, you can ask around if you want to.. Are you going to leave or should I lock you up again? I’m leaving. It felt good to meet you. Nice. Keep it up. Okay I’m off. Okay Goodbye! I’m going! Let me hide in a place.. Where there’s no one around to see me.. Let’s get going.. I’m coming! Good evening Mrs. Sufi. Right? Where we you lost? Tell me! Where were you? I was with my friends. You keep wasting your time whole day long! Don’t you get fed up? What’s wrong mom? The landlord was asking for the rent yet again today! How are you going to pay the rent? I’ll do something. Why don’t you earn properly you goof? Why don’t you just work? Let me inside at least. Get in! Oh my hair!
