[2.70] Hey. So you guys chill while drinking as well eh?
[6.00] Of course sir
[7.97] Join us please Sir
[9.98] Sir..
[12.98] Although I don’t drink
[15.13] but that doesn’t mean I can’t join you guys.
[18.00] Pour some soda for sir.
[20.80] Without alcohol.
[23.76] By the way why don’t you guys quit drinking?
[26.94] Sir
[28.34] We resolute this every night before sleeping.
[30.75] Bu then forget everything when we wake up.
[39.75] Sir I have a question.
[42.89] Why did you get transferred from the village?
[46.82] I didn’t get transferred. 
[48.43] I came here with my own consent
[50.24] Destiny
[52.18] It’s a wonder how destiny shapes a man’s life.
[56.35] Not destiny... Money
[61.61] Money even tends to change destiny.
[65.29] Anyways
[66.55] Whom is the SHO affiliated with?
[78.69] These are high level dealings sir.
[82.19] Inferior guys like us don’t meddle in such affairs.
[84.52] Sir what would we know about us such dealings?
[88.89] All we do is follow the orders with “yes sir” “no sir”.
[94.10] And just survive on petty amounts of bribes.
[98.29] That’s why you’ve always been at a constable level.
[103.44] To reach the skies You’ve got to think high.
[107.39] Sir I can’t even understand a single word of yours.
[110.78] Your words are going over the top of my head..
[115.45] That’s enough!
[116.79] Don’t give him anymore. He’s done.
[119.37] Now his glass..
[121.34] Belongs to me.
[176.82] How long will you keep sulking?
[182.69] You do know 
[185.25] that your brother wanted to go overseas don’t you?
[190.42] And never to become a policeman.
[193.82] Why is he doing all of this?
[196.69] For us..
[198.86] They both loved each other.
[203.12] Everybody has their own ways of expressing their love to each other.
[208.44] Those who have left us are gone forever.
[212.29] But those who are still here
[215.00] we need to take care of them.
 
[232.77] Boss are you playing “free fire”?
[235.12] Yes
[236.55] I have a platinum level. What’s yours?
[240.18]  I have the ‘heroic” level.
[246.56] Forget the game and keep your concentration on making the ‘gol gappas”.
[250.35] Make it quick.
[250.85] Just a moment boss.
[261.00] What do you think of them sir?
[264.00] These are better than the ‘dhahi bhallas” you treated me with.
[265.86] Sir I (Mohsin) made a promise to you that you’ll experience the most tastiest “gol gappas” of the whole city.
[272.46] Pour some more gravy.
[287.74] Oh my!
[289.26] “ayesha jatti 401”
[291.22] What’s that?
[292.59] Sir she’s a very famous tiktoker.
[299.59] Show me show me. How do I look?
[301.48] It’s a really cool snap.
[308.38] Na! I don’t like it at all.
[310.06] Excuse me?

[313.29] Yeah.

[382.77] They are harassing me. Look they even have my phone.
[391.01] What are you her manager or something

[410.43] But my phone..
[411.26] Come here I’ll tell you.
[412.32] Look he’s gone.
[416.64] I hope you aren’t in a hurry at the moment?
[425.71] Hey bro
[426.65] he’s still here.
[427.96] It seems like he can’t hear. 
[429.52] Can’t you hear me?

[454.88] Ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh..

[513.98] It really means a lot to me.
[515.32] Oh no there’s no need for it.
[517.43] This is my.. 
[519.40] This is a duty for every one of us.
[520.96] You’re right.
[522.44] There’s just a small request from you.
[523.82] Yes what is it?
[525.63] Mohsin!
[527.41] Coming sir.
[530.72] ‘ayesha jutti 40” whatever it is. 
[533.31] He’s a big fan of yours. Just grant him a selfie with yourself.
 
[535.53] Sure why not.
[538.99] Just  a second.Why don’t you join us in the photo as well?
[541.15] Sure
[545.77] Thank you.
[548.35] “Mohsin dilbar 411”
[550.90] Please do follow me.
[574.93] Malik Estate?
[579.60] Mr. Malik. 
[581.71] I’m heading your way.
[609.75] Look. An elevation is a really important factor.
[612.61] The entire look of your building, it’ll change, just transform beautifully.
[616.99] Ye sir otherwise there’s no such issue.
[620.50] Look Sir
[622.02] Sir, let me call you back in a while.
[625.23] I’ll explain everything in detail then.
[628.29] Another party just arrived
[630.21] Let me get back to you.
[638.30] Welcome, wow it’s been a while.
[643.26] Bless you.
[644.50] Look at that moustache. Do you oil it?
[648.13] Wonderful.
[651.62] I feel an introduction should be in order with this gentleman here?
[656.05] Introduce me.
[657.53] Inspector Bulla.
[659.22] Inspector Bulla. Wonderful. 
[662.12] Then this must mean that the previous one..
[665.42] Never mind.
[666.48] Hey! Bring some refreshments for the guests here.
[671.33] Mr. Malik?
[673.91] I’ve heard that you’re hunting a lot of advance contractual payments these days.
[676.16] Oh yes of course!
[678.00] No.. No.. No.. I don’t hunt them.
[680.29] Advanced payments are received.It is a part of the deal you know.
[685.03] Who is saying such things to you?
[687.32] My reputation is at stake.
[689.46] This is a fake accusation sir.
[692.12] There have been a couple of complaints against you.
[694.37] Sir people have a habit of doing such things. 
[697.90] Because of being jealous
[699.54] If someone succeeds and makes money 
[701.59] then people tend to get insecure because of that attention.
[705.93] Please ignore such fake accusations. These are all lies.
[709.49] I feel 
[711.06] like you’re quite used to jails and courts.
[713.76] No no it’s nothing like that.
[715.91] Look Inspector “Bhollay”.. I mean Bulla.
[719.08] Mr. Bulla
[720.81] It’s not something that I’m fond of.
[722.34] The nature of my occupation compels me to indulge myself in such legal frameworks.
[726.80] I have to bear them.
[728.64] The term ‘bearing’ reminds me of something.
[731.03] Mohsin!
[732.27] Sir.
[733.17] What became of the ‘leather thrasher’ that we had ordered?
[735.43] Yes
[736.13] Has it been delivered?
[737.86] Sir we have received it 
[739.56] and they have guaranteed.
[742.63] That wherever it hits
[744.63] it’ll surely scrap off 2kgs of flesh!
[747.95] No.. No.. No.. 
[749.41] Please don’t say things like that.
 
[752.11] I understand now. Let’s work with a compromise.
[756.41] What do you think? Look sir we have a lot of options.
[759.50] From Lahore to Gawadar
[763.22] Everything you touch will be yours
[765.43] Such as plots, shops, farmhouse, penthouse..
[770.53] Even my house is your house sir. At your order sir.
[773.55] Whether it be construction or renovation, the whole city’s top projects are in my hands sir.
[779.69] I’m at your disposal sir.
[784.50] Mr. Malik isn’t that bad Mohsin.
[788.07] I told you before Sir.
[789.85]  Mr. Malik isn’t that bad at all.
[793.76] That’s right.
[798.80] There is one way.
[800.37] There is? Oh thank God! That’s great.
[804.68] Umm can we change the way of this little friend of yours?
[810.00] I feel uncomfortable and suffocated because of it.
[812.78] Go ahead sir. Just give me your order.
[832.36] Wow sir. You’ve done wonders.
[838.25] Now I’ll run the show with my own rules.
[869.61] Mom has sent some tea for you.
[873.11] When has mom started to send tea for me?
[876.00] That too in the middle of the night?
[888.22] How would I know? 
[889.91] Go and ask her yourself.
[902.79] Please forgive me now.
[905.84] Come on bro. Why are you apologizing?
[909.16] I’m sorry.
[916.63] By the way can I say something?
[922.01] The slap was spectacular.
[942.55] Please give me a loaf of bread and six eggs.
[951.41] Hey you! Are you blind or what?
[955.79] This is just great.
[958.56] How much do I owe you?
[962.77] Where’s my wallet?
[1020.55] Sir what’s wrong?
[1022.55]  Please gentle with me at least.
[1025.33] Oho! How do you fire the guns? Bang! Bang! Bang!
[1032.00] Here we have him again.
[1034.74] Hey! Can’t you give it a break?
[1036.74] Oh come on Tahir bro. I’m here for you.
[1039.29] Coca Cola Pepsi, Tahir bro sexy. Muah.
[1043.48] Way to go Tahir bro.
[1044.63] Hey. Has he been here before as well?
[1046.05] Someone grab him!
[1047.68] We are so fed up of him sir!
[1049.08] Oh Tahir bro don’t get so pissed off. I’m here to cheer you up and party with you!
[1056.71] Come here you!
[1058.92] Take out my money.
[1060.00] Which money?
[1065.21] Come here.
[1066.94] Do you remember now?
[1068.18] Your money is just worth three hundred rupees.
[1070.58] But you delivered a slap worth one million dollars.
[1073.56] Quit messing around with dialogues and give me my money!
[1077.03] Hello.
[1078.40] There’s a fight going on?...What can we do then?
[1083.67] Hello.
[1085.41] Fight? Where?
[1087.88] We’re on our way.
[1090.14] The station looks quite charming. Seems like you guys have invested some money here.
[1093.12] Come here you!
[1095.55] Hey sir, what are you doing sir?
[1098.38] Sir this is my own money.
[1101.77] Sir this is my own money.
[1102.74] Who’s dollars are these?
[1104.00] I won them as a prize.
[1106.90] Take this.
[1107.90] Put him behind bars and grant him a big prize!
[1110.38] Come on. 
[1111.54] Let me treat you with a hi-tea!
[1115.01] Get moving!
[1116.31] Don’t spoil my shirt.
[1117.21]  
[1117.71] What’s wrong? 
[1118.21] Go easy on me.
[1119.19] Come on, come on, come on move!
[1135.93] So what’s going on here?
[1138.51] I’m not sure. I think there’s a fight going on.
[1141.45] I can see that for myself. Who are the ones who are fighting?
[1145.09] It’s someone named Maqsood.
[1148.23] What’s the reason behind it?
[1151.32] Sir you’re the police officer yet you’re asking me about the reason?
[1156.49] Come here.
[1158.23] Buzz off, it’s time for your tuition.
[1160.05] You too! It’s not your holiday today! Get going!
[1171.35] Sir I suggest let’s leave it up to them. It’s more like daily basis thing for them.
[1176.32]  We should head back to the station.
[1183.38] Let’s go.
[1186.50] Hey everyone! Look Ethisham is coming!
[1215.27] Are you going to keep on fighting for the rest of your life now?
[1218.29] Who is this Ehtisham?
[1220.13] Ehtisham? Oh I remember.
[1222.71] This is Ehtisham sir
[1224.30] He supervises an orphanage around here.
 
[1226.25] He’s quite famous around this neighborhood.
[1229.27] Don’t both of you have anything else to do?
[1232.45] What are you portraying in the public?
[1234.59] Always quarrelling like children.
[1238.05] Listen I don’t care. Whatever the issue is resolve it right now.
[1242.35] Come on shake hands.. Stop this right now. Come on now.
[1244.89] Okay everyone. Time to disperse.
[1257.56] Seems like he’s taken care of our duty.
[1259.30] I told you before sir. He’s quite famous around here and tends to resolves everything.
[1275.27] V.O (Shame on you)
[1276.60] Hey. Get on the bike.
[1288.25] What’s wrong with this bike now?
[1289.63] Push push come on hurry.
[1291.33] Not me you idiot! The bike.
[1294.68] Let’s go on foot.
[1296.39] Hey listen!
[1297.98] Hey listen! Why are you running?
[1300.36] Stop please..
[1301.78] Hey stop, at least listen to me.
[1304.27] Why are you running?
[1307.21] Why are you following me? What have I done now?
[1310.33] You haven’t done anything. In fact I wanted to apologize. 
[1312.22] Now if you wave a flower around a girl like this way and then do it 
[1316.00] and then do it while being in a police uniform.
[1318.37] Then it seems more like to me that maybe you were trying to harass her or something.
[1324.18] Look it was genuine mistake and I just want to apologize.
[1327.67] I’m sorry.
[1331.04] I’m Maham.
[1334.68] Inspector Bulla.
[1335.87] Nice to meet you Inspector Bulla.
[1340.33] By the way I haven’t seen you around here before.
[1342.33] He just recently got transferred.
[1344.18] Oh I see. Nice.You know our system is so corrupt
[1347.87]  but I’m sure you’re an honest officer.
[1353.61] Anyways. I’m developing an app which will help those children living in the orphanage.
[1358.25] For that I might be needing some data and statistics so I guess I’ll be seeing you around for this purpose.
[1364.03] See you.
[1371.34] Hey. What is this App Ddd.. App? Whatever it’s called. What is it?
[1375.42] Oh sir you don’t know what’s an App Development?
[1378.32] Actually App Development is something.. 
[1380.96]  Which I don’t even know myself.
[1383.36] Let’s ask him.
[1385.72] What’s an App Development?
[1387.23] Oh sir what would I know? You guys have been bothering me since morning whilst being police officers.
[1390.85] I don’t even know why I stepped in to this neighborhood in the first place.
[1392.37] Come here. Give this juice.
[1396.62] Maybe we should head back to the station. This isn’t our day.
[1402.66] Hello sir?
[1404.65] At least serve some water to a poor guy like me?
[1408.00] Oh you God fearing people!
[1409.52] Even my kidneys must’ve dried up by now.
[1412.50] I haven’t even peed since morning sir. Look over here. Not even been to the toilet once.
[1418.88] Sir what life could guys like him possibly have? Pick-pocketing, eating stuff and then spending their whole life this like.
[1424.28] They hold all sorts of information.
[1426.28] Like who’s baby is born, who’s got divorced, who holds what sort of goods, they just seem to know it all.
[1435.13] I see..
[1436.65] Oh please serve water to a poor guy like me..
[1440.18] Bring him out.
[1441.56] Yes sir.
[1444.57] One should have an air conditioner, a television set or even a girl inside in a jail.
[1447.74] Even if one can’t even have these, at least give me some respect.
[1454.42] Come on. Sir is calling you.
[1456.16] Oh go easy on me. You know me since quite long ago.
[1458.95] There’s a new officer in the station now. Things aren’t the way anymore like they were before.
[1462.63] What’s that fragrance that you’ve put on?
[1465.17] Sir
[1466.03] Hey go easy on me. 
[1467.45] What’s wrong with you?
[1468.81] I’m a delicate person, sir please tell him.
[1470.70] Should I leave sir?
[1471.53] You may go.
[1472.03] Sir!
[1475.51] Since how long have you been stealing?
[1477.75] Ever since I’ve had the burden of responsibilities.
[1480.52] It goes back to 1987.
[1483.50] When my father departed from this world during my childhood.
[1487.62] I bare even remember his face.
[1489.70] People ask me if I am Mr. Sufi’s son? I tell them that’s what I have heard because I’ve never even seen him
[1494.94] Even when my mom shows me his photo..
[1496.36] Enough!
[1498.54] Okay.
[1500.93] I’ve heard that you hold lots of information and intel.
[1503.14] Not information or intel, just some random facts and stuff. It’s not much.
[1508.64] Work as an informer for me.
[1515.71] Take this glass of water of yours back please.
[1517.08] And this is my sincere excuse. No way. This is never happening.
[1521.24] You may lock me up and keep me here.
[1524.73] I’d rather die than ever do such a thing which you’re asking of me. Not happening.
[1529.40] In today’s world of inflation
[1532.33] You can’t even manage to survive on petty amounts of theft.
[1536.44] Anyways.
[1538.44] You may leave.
[1540.82] You mean just leave?
[1543.34] You should be sure, you can ask around if you want to..
[1544.79] Are you going to leave or should I lock you up again?
[1545.92] I’m leaving.
[1549.18] It felt good to meet you.
[1551.26] Nice. Keep it up.
[1553.38] Okay I’m off.
[1555.40] Okay
[1557.87] Goodbye! I’m going!
[1568.45] Let me hide in a place..
[1573.34] Where there’s no one around to see me..
[1578.54] Let’s get going..
[1588.90] I’m coming!
[1595.23] Good evening Mrs. Sufi. Right?
[1599.97] Where we you lost? Tell me! Where were you?
[1603.63] I was with my friends.
[1604.72] You keep wasting your time whole day long! Don’t you get fed up?
[1608.55] What’s wrong mom?
[1610.58] The landlord was asking for the rent yet again today!
[1612.87] How are you going to pay the rent?
[1614.76] I’ll do something.
[1615.70] Why don’t you earn properly you goof?
[1617.96] Why don’t you just work?
[1620.91] Let me inside at least.
[1621.88] Get in!
[1623.78] Oh my hair!
