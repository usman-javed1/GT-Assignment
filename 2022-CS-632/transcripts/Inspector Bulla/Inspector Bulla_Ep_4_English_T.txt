[9.74] Booyah!
[17.36] “God has written our fates with a bear pencil”
[22.43] “God has written our fates”
[24.17] Who is it?
[26.15] Who’s there?
[27.03] Open.
[30.00] How’s it going?
[32.49] Hey! Jimmy open the door.
[34.95] Sir what I have done? Why are you after me?
[38.91] It was just mere pick pocketing. I haven’t bitten you or something.
[43.79] For God’s sake, my mom’s home.
[45.72] Oh shut up!
[46.98] Oh man
[47.70] Will you just listen to me?
[50.15] No I don’t want to hear anything. Please go away from here.
[54.63] I’ll break your door now.
[56.67] It’s a very fragile door if you tend to break it. Please take it easy.
[59.46] Then open it right now.
[62.13] Okay okay I’ll open it. 
[64.17] Step away please.
[69.23] Was the lock that jammed?
[70.63] No my finger was jammed.
[72.22] Jamshaid is that the landlord?
[78.19] Oh my. Has the landlord sent the police now?
[81.42] No no mom, this is Inspector..
[83.20] Inspector Bulla mother.
[85.76] Inspector?
[88.35] What have you done now?
[90.38] I.. I.. Please tell her.
[92.16] No no aunty. 
[94.80] He’s my friend.
[95.49]  Yes friend. He’s a really good friend of mine.
[98.35] Friend? 
[100.13] Wow I never imagined a duffer like him having such a reputable friend.
 
[104.24] Have a seat son. I’ll bring some tea for you.
[107.48] Bring some pakoras as well.
[109.03] With ketchup.
[110.17] Make something which takes more time.
[114.92] Please don’t say anything to my mom.
[118.04] I can sort out your problems. 
[120.19] Try to understand.
[121.30] Yeah right? And what if you create more problems for me instead?
[126.02] Is your landlord’s name Mian Mehmood?
[136.65] Jamshaid the landlord is here!
[139.67] Just say yes to me and I’ll take care of all of your problems.
[143.39] Monthly fees, no more thefts, no more rentals I’ll handle them all.
[147.67]  I’ll handle them all.
[149.78] All in return for one favor for me.
[155.03] I’ll decide the fee myself.
[156.55] Done.
[159.85] I’ll see.
[175.27] Jamshaid why is your friend being so generous towards us?
[180.00] He’s a new friend. He’s a good person and has a very kind heart.
[185.12] Really? I wish our bad days go away now.
[188.09] God willingly why not mom.
[198.25] Hey where’s the tea?
[199.87] Don’t worry son I’ll bring it right away.
[202.38] Tea
[206.38] Oh I hope the bed doesn’t break.
[209.83] I like this bed.
[211.27] This is my home. Not a resort.
[213.59] Hey!
[215.77] By the way thank you.
[218.04] Remember our deal okay?
[219.18] Oh yes don’t you worry.
[269.69] How’s your college going?
[271.59] It’s going good.
[272.88]  You know I’ve made a new friend. 
[274.61] And she lives nearby our home.
 
[276.77] I told her that she and I can go back home together.
[279.78]  So that you won’t have to come and pick me up.
[282.00] No way. 
[284.24] Are you crazy? We don’t even know who she is or what sort of a girl is she.
[286.61] No way.
[288.21] Mom I’ve matured.
[290.63]  I can realize what’s good or bad for myself.
[292.56] You haven’t grown that big yet. 
[294.64]  You’re still young. 
[295.86] Here take this
[296.51] I know better than you at least.
[300.00] What do you mean?
[303.63] Areeba
[306.45] These aren’t dad’s principles.
[309.81] Had it been for dad’s values 
[312.00] we wouldn’t even have afforded to live in the city.
[315.06] Can’t you see that I’m sitting here?
[317.44] Both of you always keep fighting. Behave yourselves.
[320.01] Stupid. Hand me the bread.
[333.42] Bulla go and see what’s going on.
[336.40] Mom it’s like a daily thing of theirs. Ignore them.
[338.79] What? 
[341.58] You’re a police officer
[343.37] I don’t get involved in domestic affairs. So shouldn’t you. Come on have dinner.
[346.04] I don’t get involved in domestic affairs. 
[348.41] So shouldn’t you. Come on have dinner.
[360.57] Okay I’m going. 
[361.94] I can’t even eat in peace.
[363.44] You can eat when you come back, I’ll warm it up for you then.
[368.98] I’ll slap you on your face! Do you understand me?
[370.98] Go on hit me. What else can you do? What have you done in your whole life 
[373.62] Except wasted every single penny that you’ve earned till today. What more can you do? I know how I run the house.
[378.16] Who has done everything? Who bears the whole expenditures of the home? Who pays the bills for electricity?
[381.64] Sui gas bills?
-I’m leaving
-Where do you eat from?
[384.08] Hey
[385.50] What the hell is going on here?
[387.62] What’s up with you? She’s my wife! You..
[392.72] You think you can beat her if she’s your wife?
[396.00] Go on hit her.
[397.75] Who the hell are you?
[399.23] Who are you?
[402.30] Inspector Bulla!
[405.43] If I take you to the station and thrash you
[408.00]  You won’t be able to even sit down properly for the rest of your life.
[409.85] Sir. Sir please let him go. Sir. Sir please forgive him.
[414.00] Do you enjoy getting beat up by him?
[417.83] At least care for your little one?
[419.83] Sir please just forgive us. This is our own personal affair.
[422.17] If it’s personal then keep it behind your closed doors!
[424.93] Hey let’s go. Let’s leave.
[431.75] What now? Get going! 
[435.33] All bystanders!
[438.54] Get inside your homes!
[443.39] Bulla?
[445.70] Are you satisfied now?
[451.99] “where should I head to after changing my clothes?”
[456.00] Yeah
[458.03] Oh we couldn’t meet at my place. So I thought why not here instead.
[463.19] We’ll keep changing our locations, don’t worry.
[465.74] Oh so you asked me that day about the most prominent figures around this city right?
[469.69] Well the names of “Kuki Shah” and “Muni Aunty” are in that relevant list.
[473.50] “Kuki Shah & “Muni Aunty”. I hope you’ll remember.
[477.59] Now tell me about their locations.
[479.08] As for “Muni Aunty”, she is based around…
[527.09] Kuki bro? 
[529.27]  Kuki bro?
[530.39] Please wake up. 
[539.77] See I’ve brought you your favorite “Lassi”. It’s so chilled that you’ll enjoy it at its peak.
 
[542.63] Here you go.
[546.91] You wake me up so often.
[572.14] Seems like an earthquake.
[575.49] This is much bigger than an earthquake. 
[578.01] Something different.
[623.33] Ahh to hell with it.
[627.25] Couldn’t open this up.
[628.58] It’s such a heavy door.
[630.63] I tried my best 
[632.18] but it wouldn’t move at all.
[633.74] It spoiled my macho entry! 
[636.00] Could’ve oiled it at least!
[640.10] What’s going on?
[642.11] Long time, no see eh?
[648.70] I’m coming..
[650.50] Kuki bro
[652.56]  This is Inspector Bulla.
[659.18] It seems by the tension on your face and by the way of your sitting position that..
[666.46] You’re Kuki.
[670.02] Inspector Bulla.
[673.67] And I beat openly!
[675.49] Ahhh hhaaaa aahhhaa!
[677.03] What a rhyme!
[679.13] So 
[681.28] Haven’t you told him?
[698.08] So?
[699.83] I’ve heard a lot about your business ventures. 
[702.87] So I thought I’d see it for myself.
[704.36] Seems like this goof wants to open a shop or something. 
[708.64] Hand over some stock to this wolf.
[717.89] Seems like you wish an early death for yourself.
[725.01] A side business. 
[726.93] Unlawful.
[728.63] Don’t mess around with my temper. 
[731.98] I’m already pissed off!
[735.24] Get out of here.
[756.19] Hey!
[760.67] And before my temper gets out of control
[763.78] it’s better that you turn up at the station tomorrow.
[766.09] On time.
[772.32] Oh Lassi.
[788.91] At least be generous with the sugar?
[793.14] Spoiled my mood.
[797.65] Be on time tomorrow. Okay?
[800.97] I’ll take my leave.
[801.94] Oh Bulla!
[804.79] Try to play as much as you have your ground.
[810.00] Or else you’ll regret it.
[812.76] Shah won’t spare you.
[827.83] Get up!
[829.89] Still laying on my floor!
[836.71] Call up Shah.
[839.03] Ahh what?
[839.67] Call Shah on the phone right now!
[844.28] Bastard
[862.80] Wow you’ve surely won our hearts.
[880.00] Oh my God. Do really gorgeous men like you wear such uniforms these days as well?
[885.30] Get away!
[888.75] Went directly for the pistol.
[914.61] What?
[919.66] Welcome. Welcome sir.
[924.51] Have a seat.
[932.96] Will you smoke?
[934.72] Oh no no. Smoking Kills.
[939.30] So how come did you turn up here in our poor center?
[942.66] Oh no no. Don’t call it poor center.
[945.86] Call it a prostitute center. A prostitute center.
[950.94] I like your humor. 
[952.68] I’m quite moved
[954.99] Ahh. The way you speak the literary Urdu. 
[958.98] It’s just amazing. Where do you learn it from?
[962.31] It’s our traditional language.
[964.36]  Lucknow’s air..
[965.46] Lucknow
[968.07] You’re not even the starting “L” 
[970.44] Hey!
[971.86] Come straight to the point boy!
[973.56] Ahh. 
[974.64] Here’s comes the natural language from the inside.
[978.90] Whatever the business you’re running around here.
[981.76] I don’t have an issue with that.
[983.88] I have an issue with your side business.
[988.21] What do you mean?
[990.73] Oh Uncle!
[995.61] Have you tea already. Or do you want to get it cold?
[1006.93] Look Muni Aunty.
[1008.61]  These dances, functions and such gatherings.
[1012.87]  I was referring towards other stuff that you do besides 
[1016.75] It’s pay-back time for those things.
[1019.95] And that too inside Inspector Bulla’s court.
[1023.90] Anyways
[1027.42] You may enjoy for the evening.
[1031.04]  Let’s meet tomorrow at the station.
[1034.00] Hey!
[1039.12] You’ll regret it.
[1040.61] Only a fool can say such a thing who doesn’t even know about Shah himself.
[1051.59] Come on resume it now?
[1057.81] Give me give me.
[1071.63] Why didn’t you tell me about Shah?
[1073.83] Everyone took his name except you. Why?
[1076.76] I did say “Kuki Shah” “Muni Aunty”. Don’t you remember?
[1080.52] Oh these are two separate names. Kuki and Shah. Was your uncle going to come and tell me that this isn’t a single person’s name?
[1086.60] Why did you lie to me?
[1087.82] I swear I didn’t lie to you.
[1090.15] Whoever lied is such a big mother fu****…
[1092.53] May his motorbike tyre get punctured..
[1095.10] I’ll puncture you for sure.
[1096.16] I didn’t lie.
[1097.78] Hello. Who?
[1105.84] Where?
[1112.51] Shah has called me.
[1115.03] If something happens to me tomorrow
[1117.53] then I’ll surely do something to you..
[1120.12] I’ll puncture you for an eternity.
[1125.12] Man, what the hell..
[1128.20] I said “Kuki Shah” “Muni Aunty” 
[1136.48] Happy birthday to you..
Happy birthday to you..
[1143.61] Please serve everything to the kids, I’ll be right back. I’ll be back in five minutes. Come on now.
[1151.01] Come quick. My son is waiting for me.
[1196.67] So you’re Inspector Bulla?
[1211.84] Do you know me?
[1213.30] If you want to know the truth then.. 
[1215.93] No.
[1219.67] Where are you from?
[1221.17] From Alipur.
[1222.52] A village?
[1225.80] Aren’t you scared?
[1230.33] I don’t fear anyone except God.
[1233.12] My dad taught me this.
[1235.14] Rural people have a very strange fire within themselves right?
[1240.66] That’s true.
[1242.33] I get can get you killed right away.
[1245.64] I’m aware. 
[1248.34] But I know you won’t do that.
[1251.94] Why?
[1252.74] Because you don’t like spilling blood.
[1258.15] I see.
[1261.48] I have a very strong connection with your SHO.
[1266.00] You’ll get your share.
[1271.48] Sir your business...
[1275.23] Can grow even more.
[1280.35] How come?
[1281.73] I believe in the concept of giving and taking.
[1292.86] Have you hear about “Aslam Bagh”?
[1295.13] Yes. It’s near my village.
[1298.31] That area can be very beneficial for my business.
[1304.68] But there’s a home of a woman there 
[1307.13] Her name is “Begum Durdana”.
[1309.37] She’s very stubborn.
[1313.91] But I have a few principles that I follow.
[1316.22] No murder.
[1317.85] No rape
[1319.64] And especially not in this task.
[1321.49] Otherwise this land will go over to the government.
[1326.00] Can it be done?
[1338.00] Mr. Shah. What have you done?
[1341.77] If you sense enmity then turn them into your support.
[1346.13] I have placed him in a situation
[1348.93] If he succeeds then we will walk along with him.
[1351.50] Oh Mr. Shah. 
[1352.83] What difference would a single situation make?  
[1355.33] So we’ll put him in another.
[1357.93] Don’t worry.
[1360.84] Oh Mr. Shah if you want me to shoot him then tell me.
[1366.64] A bullet isn’t always the solution to every problem.
[1369.77] Did you have the cake?
[1374.70] Eat it before you leave.
[1376.74] My wife has made it herself.
[1400.34] Get out of my way.
[1404.20] Sir.
[1405.06] Yeah?
[1406.04] Someone’s here to see you sir.
[1408.72] Okay send them in.
[1409.52] Not here sir.
[1411.38] Why not here?
[1412.07] In the “R-CHIEVES”.
[1413.60] “R-CHIVES”?
[1414.40] Sir the store room. Where you’ll find the files and darkness and the spot lights. The party of extasy..
[1420.86] Hey!
[1421.51] Sorry sir.
[1422.80] Behave yourself.
[1425.45] Where now?
[1426.07] Over here sir.
[1430.59] Ahhhaa. Enjoyment. Enjoyment. Enjoyment.
[1444.66] I never knew you had such a skill as well.
[1448.35] Which one?
[1449.49] Reading the file upside down.
[1459.50] By the way..
[1461.44] Why are you making this app?
[1462.77] The numbers are in front you. It show’s a dire need for it don’t you think so?
[1466.70] I thought maybe it must’ve been your personal interest.
[1468.25] Yeah that too.
[1470.70]  My parents passed away when I was a child.
[1473.74] I’ve come across a lot of difficulties in life.
[1476.16] But fortunately I was taken in by a good family.
[1479.59] Now I just want to do everything for all the orphans out there.
[1484.67] I’m sorry.
[1486.20] It’s okay.
[1487.49] Actually
[1489.61]  A few months ago my father died as well.
[1491.90] Oh.
[1494.15] He was also in the police.
[1497.46] But he was a man of strict rules.
[1499.33] Seems like you don’t like this that much?
[1501.97] What?
[1502.81] His taste for rules.
[1503.96] Actually 
[1505.81] Between good and bad.
[1507.99] There’s a very fine thin line.
[1509.75] Oh. So you don’t even regard the difference between goodness and badness.
[1515.12] Yes but..
[1516.78] You only do what you think is right.
[1519.46] It’s even possible 
[1521.58] that your goodness may cause harm to someone else.
[1524.77] Does it even matter? The important thing is that you stick to do goodness.
[1528.78] No. I think you should do whatever you can benefit from.
[1534.14] Rules are important to follow within this life. 
[1536.66] Otherwise people may find themselves lost.
[1539.39] I have a rule. 
[1542.18] But it’s most likely that people won’t appreciate it.
[1544.98] Okay. Till whatever extent you feel satisfied you should do that then. 
[1549.17] And the day you start feeling dissatisfied just don’t go all silent then.
[1555.89] Thank you.
[1557.35] Come I’ll drop you.
[1559.79] I don’t like taking favors.
[1561.98] It does take time but I do everything on my own.
[1567.65] Okay don’t take any favor.
[1569.66]  At least have some tea then?
[1572.96] I don’t like tea.
[1575.84] Samosas?
[1577.12] Dahai Bhallas?
[1579.03] At least have some water?
[1581.09] Everybody consumes water.
[1587.12] Oh Bulla.
[1697.52] Sir.
[1700.05] Sir..
[1702.73] Sir!
[1705.44] Sir are you alright?
[1707.04] Yeah I’m okay. What’s up?
[1708.85] You ordered some complaint files of Durdana Begum.
[1714.17] Nice
[1716.69] Sir. What is this about?
[1720.85] For moving ahead..
[1723.57] It’s a shortcut!
