[18.23] Mohsin.
[19.46] Ye sir?
[21.56]  What’s this story?
[22.97] Sir this is Nasreen.
[24.28] She steals the ladies handbags during the day.
[26.32] And those too the branded ones.
[28.50] She’s hasn’t been caught yet.
[30.98] By the way..
[33.07] Do you know her sir?
[36.87] Sorry sir.
[104.13] Oh no no aunty there’s no need for being any more courteous, I’ll take my leave now.
[107.87] Oh no son, you’re my son’s friend.
[110.00] I won’t let you leave without you having dinner.
[112.63] Sit down, you won’t leave unless you have dinner. I’m going to serve food to you anyway.
[119.33] I’ll bring something for you.
[120.46] Okay then.. Bring something.
[122.46] Oh my..
[124.73] What are you doing here?
[125.71] Son..
[126.85] Mom he..
[127.44] He’s your friend. Is that how you treat friends?
[129.63] Oh no aunty, we are just like this. Two bodies, but one soul. In fact, two bodies but same underwear.
[136.75] I’ll leave now. Kindly allow me.
[138.49] No no I’m going to bring some food. Yeah as if I’ll let you leave.
[142.52] Now that you’re here make sure you leave after having food.
[145.40] Underwear friend, I’ll surely rip your underwear off now.
[148.25] I won’t be able to digest this food.
[150.95] Eat up son. Have some more. 
[153.25] Make sure you maintain your health.
[154.36] No aunty, I’m on a “kitty” diet these days.
[157.61] Grass roots and wheat grains only.
[160.07] What? Are you a rabbit now?
[161.78] You may consider me as one.
[163.94] By the way didn’t we 
[165.57] have to meet outside today?
[167.17] Oh yes. I just came here to see whether you came back home or not. 
[171.39] That’s all
[172.47] I saw a man peeking through the door. 
[175.68] When I went to look, I found it was him. So I brought him inside.
[178.44] Mom please don’t go outside just like that.
[180.18] What if it had been a thief or a robber?
[182.43] Why don’t you advise her?
[184.66] If you’re that concerned then don’t you come back home early yourself?
[188.34] Areeba!
[189.30] What did they teach you at the college today?
 
[191.54] Mom we studied history today. 
[193.41] They taught us so much that I started to feel sleepy.
[197.84] Bulla what did you do today?
[200.73] I worked on something to make our lives easier.
[204.59] And how would that be?
[206.09] Do you want to ask me everything? Why don’t you ask her something?
[210.77] Someone asked me to keep an eye on you.
[214.00] What?
[215.14] Oh my! Mom do you see this?
[217.75] Bro asked him to keep an eye on me.
[220.50] Just because I’ve started to come and go alone? Will you treat me like this now bro?
[224.18] Thank you uncle. 
[226.03] I mean uhh bro.
[227.50] If you hadn’t told me I would’ve never known.
[229.89] Bulla this isn’t fair.
[232.81] So wrong so wrong.
[234.15] Mom you won’t take his side. No I won’t let you side with him.
[237.40] No what is this?
[240.32] What is it?
[241.54] Here look. Look what’s written.
[243.17] I loved the food. 
[245.27] Now I have two moms. Mine’s “Amma” and you’re “Mamma”.
[249.24] I’ll keep coming from now. 
[250.70] For sure.
[252.00] Bye.
[252.77] Com here.
[254.54] Take it easy.
[256.38] Stand here.
[261.57] Are you crazy?
[263.36] Don’t come to my home like this from now on.
[264.61] I was concerned about you. 
[266.70] Concerned yeah right.
[267.35] It was so tension.
[269.40] Thoughts, gas, air in the tummy. 
[273.53] Strange noises.
[274.99] I thought unless I go and see you for myself I won’t be able to have any satisfaction.
[278.12] Your mom has a strong consciousness.
[282.00] So someone has asked to keep eyes on me?
[283.88] That’s what I’ve heard.
[285.71] That’s what I’ve heard. Mr. Shah just doesn’t trust anyone like this.
[288.74] Eyes will be kept on you. You need to be cautious.
[291.99]  For real.
[295.53] Thank you.
[296.19] Oh come. 
[297.12] There’s no need for it. 
[298.88] I am obliged to your favors.
[300.87] It’s the first time I’ve seen my mom so happy.
[304.27] Just like how I always wanted to see her.
[308.47] Take care.
[309.09] You better leave now.
[310.11] I’ll leave now.
[311.63] It’s a love you.
[318.19] Showoff.
[322.28] Oh did he nick my money? 
[325.59] Where’s my wallet?
[327.31] Saved.
[339.35] Who is it?
[352.33] So are you the new officer around here son?
[355.63] Yes madam.
[356.80] Inspector Bulla.
[359.74] There were some complaints regarding this land of yours.
[362.85] Ye son, I’ve come across a lot of complaints regarding this.
[365.75] But they don’t seem to resolve.
[367.48]  And I can’t keep on attending anymore court sessions.
[370.34] Do you live alone here?
[372.13] No not alone. My grand-daughter lives with me. 
[374.72] She’s asleep right now.
[376.01] Anyways you tell me what is the problem here?
[379.12] The issue is that this land is legally registered on my grand-daughter’s name.
[382.00] And until she doesn’t come of age, I’ll have to look after this land.
[386.75] Some people came over here a few days ago. 
[388.72] They threatened us.
[390.81] Then why don’t you sell this land?
[394.08] How can I sell it? 
[395.51] I’ve lived here since my childhood. I’ll surely leave from here after I die.
[400.50] Don’t you worry.
[402.55] I’ll take care of all of your tensions.
[404.51]  I’ll deal with legal and court frameworks.
[407.25] Just sign these papers. 
[410.79] And leave the rest to your son here.
[412.81] Really?
[415.36] I’m so glad that the world still holds such people like yourself. 
[417.87] Where do I sign?
[419.04] Right here.
[420.13] Okay fine.
[426.61] Thank you madam.
[428.00]  I’ll leave now.
[429.65] May you always be happy. Bless you.
[449.52] Thank you for waiting Maham.
[452.52] But the meeting with the MNA turned out to be the same lengthy one as always.
[456.36] It’s totally alright. I can understand that you’re always busy.
[460.67] Yeah mostly in the insurance and maintenance of this place. 
[462.96] Not much other than this.
[465.11] How can I help you?
[467.49] I collected some posts and data. And made my mark around those numbers. 
[471.69] Take a look?
[472.50] Sure. Sure.
[477.93] Impressive.
[480.00] This is really good. Really good.
[482.67] Really?
[483.84] So that’s it. I’ll start making my presentation for the final financial approval. Right away.
[488.17] Yes. I’ll go through this until then. And I’ll also have a word about this with the MNA.
[492.64] Sure. Take your time.
[494.21] And let’s get this done.
[495.33] Okay. 
[497.00] Thank you.
[497.82] Thank you Maham. And keep up the good work.
[510.18] Yes? What’s this blockade of yours?
[511.85] You don’t know sir.
[514.08] What?
[514.85] You’ve been promoted sir.
[516.59] You’ve been appointed as the temporary SHO.
[518.06]  Sir Congratulations.
[519.67] Now everything will function according to you.
[530.91] Hello?
[532.46] I never disappoint those, who don’t disappoint me.
[537.61] Thank you Mr. Shah.
[540.00] Just keep on making me happy like this. 
[543.65] And I’ll keep making you happy in return.
[635.33] Oh kill him sir.
[637.03]  Wow wow. Fire. Fire. Yes!
[641.18] You’re playing awesome.
[644.23] Stop you!
[647.62] Speeding your way eh?
[650.08] Take a look at him sir.
[651.61] He’s wandering around without a helmet.
[654.97] Where are your vehicle registration papers?
[657.52] Speak up!
[664.00] He’s dumb and deaf sir.
[666.85] Okay let him go.
[671.49] Are you playing the free fire one?
[673.07] Yes
[673.57] It’s an awesome game sir. Isn’t it?
[675.05] Amazing.
[677.84] Hey you!
[680.72] He’s booyahed you.
[683.38] It’s a bad day today.
[686.78] Sir there’s a car approaching.
[689.19] A branded one.
[699.31] Pull down the window.
[713.61] Sir it’s Bilal Saeed.
[714.90] Sir
[715.74]  He’s my favorite singer sir.
[717.74] Sir the tea has spilled and the closet has opened.
[721.63] Alright..
[724.51] Such tall walls and such high class cars eh?
[727.84] Inspector Bulla right?
[730.55] Such an interesting name of yours.
[732.83] And so is my character.
[735.53] That’s hard. Really hard.
[737.39] Got no company today?
[741.64] Sir. 
[743.23] The company is actually calling me since quite a while now, if you’d let me reach her? I can then drop my CV to her.
[750.36] Putting the pressure on us then eh?
[752.88] Alright. Okay.
[754.50] Just 
[756.80] Don’t forget to keep treating us.
[759.05] No tension sir.
[761.37] The treat just always slips from my own hand.
[765.79] We’ll keep seeing each other.
[766.97] For sure.
[768.17] Let him through.
[773.15] I’m actually enjoying our blockade today sir.
[778.27] Let’s trap someone else.
[799.40] Hello.
[801.87] I know. I know. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
[804.23] Exactly ten minutes late.
[807.30] What can i do..
[808.55] You know there’s so much going on these days..
[811.61] Actually I’ve been promoted to the SHO post.
[814.68] What?
[816.32] Congratulations.
[817.43] Thank you. Thank you.
[820.52] Wow. 
[822.13] You’ve already ordered everything beforehand.
[823.85] If you’ll be that late, I’ll have to take care of this.
[825.52] Do you need anything else sir?
[826.51] Yes just bring the bill.
[832.09] You must be really worthy
[833.71] That’s why you’ve been promoted so early.
[836.33] Ahh what can I say? Just the hard work I guess. 
[839.17] Really hard working traits.
[841.41] Anyways what’s the update on your app?
[843.84] The app requires a lot of work. 
[846.00] It’s still in its research phase.
[848.44] But there’s surely one thing.
[849.61] Ehitsham’s organization is really helping me so much.
[855.04] Yeah Ehtisham. 
[857.26] He has a lot of influence for sure.
[859.35] Exactly. 
[860.29] You also noticed that right? 
[862.28] Me too.
[863.36] People really think so high of him. 
[866.29] And he’s such a nice person on the whole.
[868.29] Whenever you come across him, you’ll always find him helping someone.
[874.13] You seem really close to him.
[877.79] What?
[880.30] You’re getting jealous right?
[882.53] Jealous? And me?
[883.48] No no.
[886.86] There’s nothing like that at all.
[889.00] There's no such thing but still if you need any help..
[893.70] I’m a SHO now so..
[896.98] Yes you’ve mentioned it already. That you’re an SHO now.
[905.38] By the way
[906.75] Ehtisham is only helping me but strictly professionally.
[909.45] It’s nothing more than that.
[910.23] Oh no no. There’s nothing like that in my mind.
[913.99] Don’t worry. Relax.
[915.18] I accept.
[915.95] But
[917.44] Thanks for clearing though.
[918.59] Madam here’s your bill.
[920.68] Hey hand that over to me.
[923.22] I know madam doesn’t accept favors.
[925.26] Definitely.
[929.40] Here you go.
[932.12] What are you doing?
[933.20] You said it yourself. 
[934.60] Split the bill in half.
[935.68] Is that how you divide the bill?
[937.48] I’m learning. I’m learning how to do it.
[939.43] Anyways. 
[940.43] Let’s eat.
[949.32] Oh no no sir. We are still indebted towards you Mr. Chaudhary. 
[953.60] No no I’ll handle it myself. Oh it’s not a problem at all. Yeah.
[961.28] Sir it’s behind your ear.
[963.55] Thank you.
[967.36] Name?
[968.08] Azaan.
[969.17] Full name?
[970.09] Azaan Malik.
[970.88] Azaan Malik.
[972.93] And the jewelry which got stolen 
[975.57] Was it original or a fake?
[977.34] Sir it was made of gold. Inside my “daizigner” bag.
[982.49] Original.
[985.07] Okay Mr. Azaan Malik. 
[987.02] I’ve written it down here.
[988.71] We’ll see what we can do about it.
[991.15] Sir.
[1011.40] Make sure you handle their case on a priority basis.
[1014.51] Sure sir.
[1017.10] Now tell me. I think this theft has been performed by a professional.
[1037.19] Wow Bulla. 
[1040.53] You’ve become a great officer.
[1047.80] Bulla whatever happened before, I really regret it.
[1056.14] Whatever you wanted you got it.
[1064.40] Your case will be solved soon.
[1066.68] Take care.
[1067.76] Bulla?
[1085.79] Who’s wedding are you returning from?
[1088.00] My marriage has been fixed.
[1089.86] Here have some sweets.
[1091.39] Wow. Seems like you’ve caught a train.
[1094.28] Yes yes it’s been fixed finally.
[1096.04] Just like the “Pindi Express”.
[1099.03] The girl’s family visited us today.
[1101.68] Only ‘Gulab Jamans” but no “Barfi”?
[1103.68] It’s a really expensive world these days. 
[1106.97] Hey. 
[1109.90] Are you smoking weed?
[1111.46] Oh just sometimes.
[1112.79] Not much.
[1113.68] Listen to me. 
[1114.63] You’re about to get married, your mom’s all alone. These habits don’t suit you anymore.
[1118.49] Oh no I’ll surely quit it from now. My to be bride hates smoking overall.
[1123.60] I thought if that’s the case, then I’ll only puff on joss sticks from now on.
[1127.50] Ah forget it.
[1129.45] Is this going to be a love marriage of yours?
[1131.03] Oh we’ve been in love since a long time now.
[1133.71] The marriage arrangement has been fixed through your support.
[1135.64] I’ll surely celebrate my marriage with full dances. I’ll get the streets decorated, have songs being played throughout like “Ah lare eeyy”. Full enjoyment.
[1143.45] Just don’t pick-pocket your in laws please.
[1145.18] Oh I’ve checked their pockets already. They are all empty.
[1147.81] You naughty idiot!
[1149.06] Unemployed people they are.
[1150.07]  And they were asking me for a loan.
[1151.55] Give me the sweets.
[1152.46] Let me eat as well.
[1155.04] Such a big mouth of yours.
[1156.64] If you share the same bite then it means you’re more bonded together.
[1158.15] How much more bonding do you want now?
[1159.46] You even get sick because of it.
[1161.03] You’re a sickness yourself.
[1161.88] Yeah.
[1162.78] Any tip for my marriage?
[1164.91] Should I start consuming dry fruits from now?
[1177.39] You’re here already?
[1181.25] Yes.
[1183.45] Are you excited?
[1185.32] Yes sir.
[1188.00] What’s with the sir sir?
[1191.23] You’re going on a special dinner.
[1192.93] You’ll come across a lot of important people there.
[1194.95]  They should know that you’re my special guy.
[1202.09] Here.
[1204.52] If anything gets spoiled you never clean it.
[1210.29] You just change it.
[1212.57] Go sit in the car, I’ll join you in a bit.
[1228.52] Sorry Mr. Shah, I got a bit late.
[1230.88] No no you go and rest. There’s already so much work load on you. Go and rest.
[1233.60] Oh no Mr. Shah I’ll come along please.
[1260.00] If you say another word I’ll throw you in this flame!
[1267.94] You should’ve stayed within your limits Bulla!
[1271.65] Should’ve stayed within your limits, you haven’t been fair in this!
[1276.10] Does he think he can just come in like this and take my place?
[1289.75] Everyone surely has some sort of a weakness.
[1294.65] Figure out his weakness.
[1297.30] Find out his weakness.
