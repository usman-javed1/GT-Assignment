Accept it Bulla, you’ve surely lost today. Damn it! How come is he winning again and again? I fall from the top baby. I always have it figured out way before. You lunatics wouldn’t even have a single clue. I’ll make sure I get to you one day eventually. Hey guys, Listen to me Oh come off it! You’ve been blabbering the same thing ever since. It’s not just difficult to defeat him, it’s merely impossible. Yeah right you fake piece of Bollywood. What does he think of himself? Like a don or something? Looks guys do whatever you want to. Because I’m not going to be sticking around here for long anyway. Why so? Got your visa already? No worries, I’ll get the visa as well. And when it come, Your brother will get a job Parties And then. What do you call it? Permant Residence. Not Permant you idiot. It’s Permanent. At least learn to speak proper English first. Sure Uncle, go ahead and tease me as much as you want to. When I get to the UK, you’re all going to be calling me and begging to talk to foreign women. Yeah yeah yeah. The bird isn’t even in his hand and he’s already thinking of flying in the skies. At least go and ask your dad first. I’ll get him convinced. And if he doesn’t agree, I’ll spill chilies into his “Hooka”. But i will definitely go I will fly away at all costs. Even if I have to take the canal road route. That’s all good but how about leaving from here first? Yeah Uncle, How much we have to pay? Your bill is nearly. On second thoughts, put it all into my debt account. How many debts do you feel like inducting further? They just keep increasing and never even seem to end. God help you guys! All aboard! How’s the jump? Oey! What the hell are you freaks up to? Go spill your booze somewhere else! Smoke it up! Come on! Disperse! Samina Where is our son? Is Bulla back? Yes. He is asleep. Perhaps he’s tired. Tired? He’s always messing around aimlessly. Does he come home to rest only? No dad. He doesn’t mess around. In fact one of his friend called him today. Actually Actually today his friend called him He was calling him over for a job. Right mom? That’s where he went today. Yeah stop with the excuses already. You’re always covering up for him. Am I not aware of whatever he’s up to? Where he goes? Whatever he does? Whatever he’s involved in? I know everything You're my daughter. Don't be my mother I'm his father. I know everything about him. Let me call him Forget it. Just have your dinner. Hello Everyone Hello What’s up for food? Gosh I’m starving. I say Samina. We should have a public announcement today. That our son will actually sit us finally and have dinner together. What an achievement. Enough with sarcasm. Let’s have dinner first. Tomorrow You’ll be going to the police station with me from tomorrow. Why? What do you mean why? Do you want to waste yourself for a lifetime? At least get a proper job. Don’t you want to make a living? Or do you want to waste your whole life? Oh he’ll get settled. There’s enough time for that. Samina he’s just spoiled because of your pampering’s. I was already on the post of being a constable when I was of his age. What have you achieved? What you said? Just that your pace of progress like a tortoise in ten years is something I can achieve in five. Did you hear that? Are you listening to your charmed son? He’s ridiculing my entire honestly earning and hard working life with the pace of a tortoise. And you’re tolerating this? Okay just let it go. At least have dinner. It is because of these honesty values that we’ve never had a proper life mom. Son you only get basics for survival when you earn through honesty. If you’re that eager to fly high, then go and earn yourself. Children like you who take everything for granted can never feel satisfied. I’ll surely earn. At least I’ll be able to progress more in life. Do progress in life. Our best wishes are with you. No! Thank you so much dad. Don’t leave your food unfinished. Enough mom! I’m already full because of his taunts. What is it with this daily bickering and nonsense? Before getting up, clean this all. Both of you. Understood. Get up! Let’s go Areeba.  Let them do it on their own. What nonsense. Oh hello! Where do you think you’re going? Sit down. Eat if you please. You’re clearing this mess yourself eitherway. Do you expect me to work both outdoors and indoors? Mom’s gone. And he thinks as if he’s the brave one around here. Give me a plate Let’s go on darling! Let’s go on darling! Stop it with the singing Bulla. What’s gotten in to you? I had a dream Bulla. What dream? It was hell. There was fire all around. The angels told me that whatever work that we’re doing right now in our lives, it’s all wrong. Hold on. Just because you’re trying to look modest in your religious outfit, you think you can interact with angels now? I sought some help through holy recitations. What help? Help in selling this motorbike?  The angels (Karaman & Katabeen) sitting on both of our shoulders are taking all of this into account. Who? Karaman and Katabeen. Hey listen to me. We don’t manipulate anyone’s rights. We function over demand and supply. Whatever demand is called for we just supply it. That’s all. But Karaman and Katabeen.. Hey I get the point okay? You need to get that as well. Focus on the work Look at me Look. At least hear me out? I just need a few more funds to fly away to the UK. As soon as I have them, we’ll quit this work. Okay? Alright then. That’s my boy. Order some tea. Hey uncle, can we get two cups of tea please? Hey Bulla. Look. I’ll be right back Just park the motorbike. Oh Bulla. Enough with the flirtations already. You won’t get anything out of it. What are you staring at? Stop it. Na can’t seem to stop myself My heart doesn't satisfy Really? My very own “Haimaa” Not “Haimaa”, my name’s “Hillah” Does that matter? You’re still “Haimaa” for me. Come here. Here’s a small gift for you. Bulla. How are you going to survive in the UK without me? It’s just a matter of a few months. I’ll call you over. Really? How can I come over? Dad won’t agree. Don’t worry about him, we’ll have him convinced. You sure? Surely. Okay take a look here. Take a look here. See what I’ve got. You know my friend Reema? Her employer gave away so many of her clothes to her. So I selected this one for myself. What do you think? Hey these are such tight fitted outfits. Don’t you feel ashamed? What’s there to be ashamed about? They just dress up like this over there in the UK. Always dress up according to the cultures where you dwell. I’m surely wearing these. Look.. Don’t you like it? Fine. I’ll refuse her and won’t get it. Hey no. I was only kidding. Okay tell me. Do you have any other plans? Tight fitted outfits, make ups, heels, deezigneer bags. Oh it’s not deezigneer, It’s designer, designer. Whatever Do you want to see my “Billi” walk? What’s a “Billi” walk? Catwalk. I’m just going to do that over there and I have practiced it so much already. Want to see? Hold this, hold it. Let me show you right away. Look. Like this. Wow. Amazing. Be careful there. Just sit down, sit down. So what do you think? Yeah right catwalk. The flower please? I recommend walking straight first please. It’s great, marvelous. I’ll learnt that as well when I get there. It’s going to be so amazing there. Can I put my arm around you? Yeah sure. She’s calling you. Oh my God! What hell yeah? I won the game. Enough of your game! Oh wow. Biscuits. Manners! Don’t just dig in. It’s bad. Leave it. They’re just biscuits. Mom one thing is for sure. I’m really going to miss your cooking when I’ll be in the UK. Just the food only? Ahhh the sentiments are flying already eh? Come here my beautiful heroine. Oh God! These big biceps of yours! Can’t help them, they’re just too big. By the way, is it that necessary for you to move overseas? If I won’t go, then how would I be able to get you all a big house in a big city? It’s just that everyone really loves you here. Who’s in everyone? You dad. Oh forget it mom. No he really loves you. He doesn’t love me. If I wasn’t his biological son he would’ve surely murdered me someday. Bring the tea. Hear that, speak of the devil already. Okay just take these, it’s all ready. Go. Why should I serve these? I’m not getting a marriage proposal or anything. Who else should I ask? Bulla don’t have time. Bulla.. Don’t even know what he said. You’re speaking in English already? Because I’m heading to the UK you know. Bulla don’t.. I don’t know what.  Mr. Muzzafar doesn’t let go of any place in which he’s interested. And he will surely be displeased with your lack of cooperation. Yes. I can understand that. But the very day I wore this uniform, I made a promise and a commitment to myself. And that was that I will never resort to any means or dealings of dishonesty. That’s all. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Those honest one’s prides eventually cost them hard.   Honest people?  And they like to think that they are the only ones in the whole world full of honesty? Let me tell you Mr. Saleem. No one is this world is fully righteous. Even after trying so hard, there are always loop holes and potentially loose ends. You may play around with as many words and phrases as you please. What is wrong will always be wrong. Your son wants to go to the UK. Your daughter is studying right now and she’d want to continue her academics in the future as well. You got your uniform already Mr. Saleem and you’ve worn it.  Why don’t you take something for both of them? They’ll surely need it. Not a chance. Not even till my last breath. Get it? Alright. I’ll take my leave then. At least have your tea? Maybe some other time. If we live till then.. Okay then. Take care. Why are you so late? The guest has left already. And you’re still standing there holding the tea tray. All good? Why don’t you speak up? This?  
Is this your love for me? Everything is a lie. It’s nonsense. Bulla! Bulla? Parents even sacrifice their lives for their children. But look at him!
He can’t even take a small amount of bribe for us. Stop it. Are we even his own offsprings or not? Just stop it! No This person is never going to let us succeed in life! Forget going to the UK, I’m sure he won’t even be able to afford Areeba’s wedding expenses in the future. Enough Bulla. Just stop it. No mom no. It would’ve been much better if we didn’t have a father at all in your place. Bulla! Bulla! He could’ve taken the money mom. Then I wouldn’t have to indulge in these pathetic labor works. We could’ve got settled. Yeah right settled! Do you know how long he has served in the police department? And during all this time how many people have already tried to bribe him? Why didn’t he ever take it? Why? Because he is a selfless man! Selflessness often turns into selfishness mom. You seem pretty selfish to me in this moment. Listen to me. Just because you wanted that, why would’ve he taken the bribe? He has never fallen prey to such things. You own loved ones are your strength. Not your weakness. By the way, those were some harsh words you said to your father. That really hurt him. He’s angry with you. Okay mom, just don’t get all sentimental now. I’ll go to him. But only because of you. Go to him.  Go wake him up for morning prayers. Hang on. When was the last time that you offered your prayers? I just offered the congregational prayers a couple of days ago. Way to go son. Two day ago right?  It’s time for morning prayers, go get ready for them. Why are you wearing an earring? It’s my style mom. It’s my SWAG, SWAG. You won’t get it. SWAG? What in the world is that? Hello sir. Hello sir. I’m really sorry about your father’s loss. He was a really nice person. May God bless his soul. It’s all upon the Creator’s will. Anyways, this is the bill of the all of the stuff that was arranged. I’d be grateful if you can pay it now so that I can leave on time. Thank you. Thanks a lot sir. I’ll pray for your father. God bless his soul. What is this mom? Ever since the past five years, a little by little, this is what your father was trying to save for you.  So that you could go overseas. What? The love of a father and son is way bigger than a mere point of view. You’re the head of this family now Bulla. You’re all who’s left now. Do whatever that you wish. Whatever that you want. Bulla I heard about your father’s demise. I’m really sorry for your loss. Everything just happened so quickly. What happened to your father? Okay listen. I know this isn’t the appropriate time to ask this but what will become of us now? What do you mean? I mean that I’m getting proposals at my home for marriage Bulla. I have to give an answer, so I need to know where we’re heading towards now? This really isn’t the feasible time to talk about it. So when will that time arrive Bulla? My dad has grounded me already, he keeps questioning me daily. He pressurizes me and I can’t hold it off for long. And now you’ve even called off from going to the UK, since you’ve taken the responsibility of your mother and sister. If this doesn’t change, then I’m afraid we won’t be able to go along ahead. Just give it a thought. I’m getting late, I have to go. Oh not a problem Mr. Chaudhary. I came to collect a few of my father’s belongings.. I heard about your father. I’m really sorry for your loss. He was an honest man. When are you going to the UK? If you want to make your way around this world,  you only need one thing. Cash. Money. For going to the UK, for buying a house or for silencing someone. I’m sure you’ve understood what I was trying to tell you. Money makes it all happen. Have a seat son. I’m really sorry for your father’s loss. He was a very honest man.  A pious religious person. May God grant him paradise. Amen. What happened to him? How much did you take? Look Bulla. These are very powerful people. I can’t challenge them. I’m quite helpless, I have my own responsibilities to fulfil. Here’s a brotherly advice for you. Take up your father’s post. Look I know, I understand that it was never your ambition to join the police force. But give it a good clear thought.  You’re an educated person.  You’ll get promoted in no time. And your mother and sister need you. If you work with the required manner, then both money and power will be in your hands. Bulla nothing in this world functions without money. If you’ve got money then you’ve got everything. Just give it a thought using a cool head. What do you say? V.O (If this doesn’t change, then I’m afraid we won’t be able to go along ahead) V.O (You’re the head of this family now Bulla.  V.O (You’re all who’s left now. Do whatever that you wish.) V.O (If you want to make your way around in this world you only need one thing V.O (If you work with the required manner, then both money and power will be in your hands.) V.O (Cash. Money.)
