So did you enjoy at the party? Yes I enjoyed a lot. I like the fact that you
enjoyed. When I called you, why didn’t
you come? Actually I.. I don’t like to wait. Don’t do this again. Your shoe laces are open. Even the shoes cost ten hundred
thousand rupees It always stay in the feets. Things never forget their worth. Humans forget it. Goodnight Tea? Thank you. The NGO’s financial report is
almost ready. I’ll work on it tonight and
submit it to you by tomorrow. How do you work so hard like
this? I just try. That’s all. By the way Seriously... I really want to
know. How do you find so much
motivation for it? Let’s just say ever since my
childhood then. And through my parents who
adopted me. Sometimes I think, had it not
been for them, I wouldn’t have stood anywhere in my life. So that’s why you try and keep
helping such kids? Yes. But not as much as you do. I mean you’re always around
them 24/7. How can someone do so much for
someone else? No It’s nothing like that. It is exactly like this. Well You’re adopted as well right? You’ve never shared how your
experience has been through this. I still don’t know till today Why I was adopted? Maybe because my parents wanted
to do some goodness in this world. But they weren’t that close to
me. I couldn’t even imagine.. That your childhood could’ve
been like that. Regardless of that you have
such positivity. How? Because what i went through. I don’t want these kids to go
through the same. If some guys like you get to
become a part of our political system then I swear the destiny of
this country can change completely. Still nothing will change. Why? Because even a few guys like me
can’t change the whole system of the country. The whole nation should give
input. Right? You know what should be done
about such people? They should be killed. What’s wrong? I’m just kidding. Sir. It’s alright Mr. Manager. Alright. You don’t have to worry. We’ll do your work. Okay. Our officer is really hard
working. You can see him right here. He’s a little busy. Anyways, please make sure the
tea is bit more warm next time. Sir doesn’t like it cold. Don’t worry. Sir. You’re playing really cool sir. Kill him at least. Kill him. Sir Sir! Can’t you see I’m playing the
game? You’re playing the game here
and someone’s placing the game over there. It’s our sister in law. And she’s on a date. Who’s that monkey with her? Let’s go check it out. So what do you think about this
idea? What do you think? I think it’s a great idea
actually. I’m very excited to go and have
our businesses together. I think we can benefit from it. Okay so.. Who are you? What’s going on here? Bulla what are you doing here? Who is he? Introduce me. Inspector Bulla. Inspector Bulla? He is Inspector Bulla. He is
this area’s.. No. You be quiet. Let me handle. Who are you? Where have you come from? You seem like a youtuber from
your face. In fact you look like a
Tik-Toker. Put him in the car. Mohsin What are you doing? Oh hello! What is this? He’s call me a
Tik-Toker. Actually He’s just a friend.. Yes. You’ve said that right. Friend. . And a special one I have another friend here. Say hello to my little friend. What are you doing? Meet him. Maham. What is this? Is this guy a psychopath or
something? I’m really sorry. I can fix
this. Hold on. What’s a psychopath? Psychopath? Path. Yes path sir.. Yes path. Path. There’s just
one path for you now. Exit path. Go on. Bulla! You know what Maham? You know what Maham? I’m sorry
but I’m going to have to leave now. This is getting
unprofessional and I’m out of hands. And by the way please,
please don’t call me again. Please thank you. And yes you. I can’t believe you called me a
Tik-Toker. I’m a Snacker. I have seventeen thousand eight
hundred and ninety followers. And yes. I’m not interested in girls. He doesn’t seem straight to me. See how scared he was? Sissy. I’m so intimidating. Did I say something wrong? You’re still thinking if you’ve
said anything wrong? Do you know who he was? He was my app’s potential
investor. Whom you have ridiculed, scared
and threatened so much so that he ran off. But Maham I.. I, you, he.. What? Listen to me Bulla. I haven’t given you the right
to interfere in my life like this! Maham? Did you see how scared he was? Exactly sir. You as well. Grab my pistol. Yes? Sir. I’ve narrated everything
to you. Believe me sir. I was just
pulling the car out.. Sir I.. I.. I.. Sir look I.. Please understand.. I was just.. Hey Goshi! Stop it. You can play when we
get home. No! Hey! Hey you! Tell me. What’s the problem? Hey tell me.. Tell me.. Ahh well umm.. Umm nothing sir.. Nothing happened.. Nothing happened at all.. Goshi dear Goshi son please give this to
us.. Back to work everyone. What’s up with sir? Has he gone crazy? He had a fight with sister in
law. Oh. With extreme caution and care.. I’m telling you that the news
I’m hearing around isn’t good at all. I advise you to be careful with
that Kuki. He’s very pissed off. He’s just jealous. He can’t bear finding me more
close to Mr. Shah Whatever it may be.. He’s a very dangerous person. He can do anything. Don’t you worry. I’ll take care of him. Why would I be worried? I only had to inform you which
I have done. In fact I remember.. This. For you What’s this? Oh I see... I’m getting married. Next week? Yes. You seem to be in a hurry. That’s how it is. Slow down or you’ll get a
ticket. You should also get married. When will you marry? I will when I’ll be worthy of
it. Seems like there is someone. Right? Right? Tell me the next thing? I don’t care if somebody dances
or not but I will dance for sure on your wedding. In a whole joyful moment when
there will be bank notes flying all over. “The night of your wedding
celebrations” Everything will be mine. Hello hi Hi. I just wanted to say that I’m
really sorry for today. I guess I said a bit of too
much to you. No no why are you apologizing? Actually it was my fault. Is it the first time you’ve had
a woman in your life? Oh no no. So did you behave like this
with the rest of them? I’ve never felt the same way
with the rest of them I’ll have to teach him so much. What would you have to teach me? Look. When you like someone or when you get to be friends
with someone then you have to build your
trust with them and have to maintain some
boundaries of privacy with them. And I’m afraid if you can’t do
both of these, then we don’t have any future together. Why are you laughing? I really like this future part. Did you hear anything other
than this? Not at all. Actually I trusted someone once. She left me during my bad times. I just didn’t trust at all
after that. Bulla all I can say is that Everyone isn’t the same or
alike. Goodnight. Goodnight. It’s nice. Sometimes a person should
forget everything And think about such things. They should talk about things
which they don’t normally talk about. We tend to get so busy in our
lives that we never get a chance to reflect on our past. Bulla... You’ve never talked about your
father. Now that he isn’t alive anymore
so... What do you think about it? I don’t think at all. I avoid it. Why? Maham.. Our relationship wasn’t a good
one. But yes if I could just talk to
him for one last time then.. Things would’ve been different. I always used to think that Those people are really lucky Who have their own loved ones. How strange it is. That I had everything yet I wanted to go the UK. By leaving everything. What have you thought now? Just that in order to balance
relationships One needs money. Look. If my father had money Then my relation would’ve been
a good one with him. If I had money then Hina wouldn’t have left me. And haven’t you thought That you can balance
relationships even without money Mr. Inspector? No What? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Often regardless of having so
much money or power One still tends to lose their
precious relations. Do think about it. Okay teacher come please
sit
-Now tell me where are you taking me? I’m taking you to balance
relationships. First balance the bike. Let me start it at least. It’s
getting me insulted. See this app here? By pressing this button we can
help you whenever you’ll be. There’s just a little time to
go now. After that we’ll give you the app after it’s developed. Then you can easily reach out
to us. And I’ll also tell you
something really special.. Sister Dawar is laying outside.
He isn’t getting up. Laying down? What do you mean? What happened Maham? I don’t know. He was unconscious so I brought
him to the hospital. He’s over-dozed. Over-dozed? By what? Drugs. Ehtisham brother it’s because
of you that I’m not involving the police in this. But he’s in a very critical
state. And according to the reports. it’s a repetitive drug abuse. I’m sorry. This is all... My fault. How is it your fault? You always work for everyone’s
benefit. Why are you feeling guilty? This is so not your fault. Dawar? Son who gave the drugs to you? Son don’t be afraid of us. Tell us who gave the drugs to
you? There is a man. He gives drugs to us. Dawar since when has this been
going on? I don’t know. Whoever he is I won’t spare him. Dawar where does he meet you?
Where does he give you these drugs? We can take Bulla’s help. We
can involve him in this Ehtisham. We can catch that guy. You sell drugs to kids? Who’s stuff is this? No sir I.. Who’s stuff is this? I just supply it. It doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to Mr. Shah. What? It belongs to Mr. Shah. Get lost. Who’s Shah? Bulla stop him, he’s running
away. We caught him with so much difficulty. Who is Shah? Do you know him? Bulla are you listening? Do you know who Shah is? Speak up! Whoever he may be.. We don’t need to get involved
in this case. He’s supply drugs to these
young kids and you’re saying not to get involved in this case? So what? He isn’t forcing them. They are doing it willingly. If we get rid of Shah today,
tomorrow you’ll find another one. My hands are tied. Are your hands tied.. or joined with him? Your promotion to a SHO.. Your elite life style? Everything was happening so
quickly, that I’m so stupid I couldn’t even see it. Look.. Don’t. I’ll bring Shah To justice myself. And for that I don’t need your
help. What relation do those kids
have with you? Why are you taking such a big
risk for them? Is it necessary for me to have
any relation to them in order for me to do something for them? You don’t have any humanity
within yourself and you’re expecting the same from me? Which humanity Maham? Which humanity? There’s a bunch of every lying
and deceiving personnel in every corner of the streets, There’s milk being sold with
water mixed in it. Even though the doctors sell
such medicines which.. Humanity doesn’t exist anymore
Maham. It just doesn’t exist. That was because of humanity
Bulla That someone chose to adopt me. They taught me, fed me, because
of which I reached here today. Humanity still exists. It’s people like you who are
trying to kill it. If you’ll respond badness with
badness then the world will be destroyed. So much cruelty? So much injustice? And you want us to do nothing
at all? At least I can’t live in a
world where we can’t even help anyone according to our capacity. We owe this to others Bulla. But I guess you won’t
understand. I actually thought That you’re not like this.
