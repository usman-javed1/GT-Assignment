[11.63] Where’s Maham?
[13.20] In the ICU
[16.54] What happened?
[17.55] Accident.
[22.05] She was coming to meet me at the office. And during the way someone..
[33.35] Someone called me from the last dialed number and I came over.
[36.46] She has a head injury.
[49.71] How is she now doctor?
[50.97] The head injury was very severe 
[52.55] because of which the patient is in a state of coma.
[55.04] I’m sorry we are trying our best.
[59.30] Doctor ahhmm.. What do you mean she’s in a coma?
[60.73] What do you mean she’s in a coma?
[77.28] Don’t worry. 
[80.29] She’ll recover soon.
[260.36] Everyone’s blasting fireworks. 
[261.94] But you’re just playing with matchsticks.
[266.90] What’s wrong bro?
[269.84] I’ve never seen you like this before.
[274.45] Nothing like this has ever happened before as well.
[277.06] What happened? At least tell me.
[280.88] It’s out of my understanding.
[286.66] You know what?
[288.45] I recently got to study about karma.
 
[292.51] Whatever someone does with another
[296.38] It rotates and comes right back at him.
[300.49] If you’ve been wronged 
[304.10] Then you must’ve wronged someone before.
[310.23] Areeba. 
[312.45] Please tell me the truth.
[316.74] Am I a bad person?
[319.07] Bro. You’re such a nice man. 
[322.75] For real.
[323.98] If dad had been alive 
[326.31] He would’ve been so happy to see you.
[331.12] And who doesn’t have flaws in themselves? 
[333.28] Tell me.
[334.38] The actual thing is to make sure that flaw doesn’t succeed.
[339.02] And what if it succeeds?
[341.74] Then my teacher says 
[344.01] Try
[345.72] Try again
[347.37] Till you succeed.
[349.31] If you give up trying then it means 
[351.95] You’ve surrendered yourself before your flaws.
[355.32] Isn’t that right?
[374.94] What are you doing mom?
[377.20] I’m sewing up your shirt’s button what else?
[386.15] What? 
[387.39] What are you doing?
[389.49] Mom you carry on with your work. 
[391.96] Let me get some peace.
[394.39] Really? 
[395.00] Even after you’ve grown up? Have it your way. Have your peace.
 
[429.28] Dad?
[439.12] Where did you go?
[446.53] I’ve cut some regretful deals dad.
[450.86] It’s alright. 
[452.08] Learn from these mistakes 
[453.67] And don’t repeat them again. That’s all.
[460.42] Dad.. 
[463.03] I’m such a bad person.
[464.55] Sometimes our inner flaws 
[467.27] Tend to overpower our goodness.
[470.17] And 
[472.03] Overpowering isn’t an issue.
[474.98] It’s just that 
[476.26] Your flaws never ought to win
[479.30] And son 
[480.71] Your inner goodness is still alive.
[492.43] Forgive me dad.
[497.14] The greed for money 
[500.50] Turned me blind.
[504.29] Nobody turns blind son. 
[507.12] It’s just 
[508.42] that sometimes 
[509.50] People tend to lose their visions.
[511.97] Your visions have still a long way to go. 
[516.69] You still have your visions.
[558.00] Bastard.
[571.04] Name?
[573.68] Wajahat.
[575.73] Gender?
[577.97] I..
[579.72] What’s your gender?
[581.18] I’m a male.
[583.63] You’re not a male.
[585.43] You’re just a prick who raises his hands on his wife and kids.
[591.25] Males like you 
[593.04] Only have a single pride to rely on.
[595.76] Your masculinity.
[600.19] Wajahat. 
[601.79] If your wife or kids ever complain again 
[606.84] Then believe me
[609.00] I don’t even know myself of what I’ll do to you.
[614.83] Understood?
[628.39] Leave.
[668.28] We’ve been wearing the uniform since so long.
[671.56] It’s time to actually fulfil its responsibility now.
[674.46] Sir 
[675.77] What do we have to do?
[687.18] Hey make sure you that you deliver the whole goods with care at the drop point.
[690.93] Make sure there are no problems.
[695.59] I’ll join after getting free from here.
[698.01] Hang up now.
[715.83] Hey..
[717.95] Bulla what are you doing here?
[721.09] There were some pending settlements to make.
[724.68] Thought I’d fulfil them.
[731.30] You think you can make any settlements?
[734.01] Did you forget
[735.97] How I tore off your book?
[741.16] How were you crying and asking.. 
[744.78] Please hand him over to me.
[747.55] I’ll deal with him myself.
[754.23] How was the pain and agony?
[756.05] I was enjoying.
[758.41] Bulla your game’s over.
[761.53] Finished.
[764.25] Shah will kill you himself.
[766.23] Get out from here.
[771.29] You’ve got that right
[773.24] All the time “Shah” “Shah” “Shah”.
[776.69] You don’t even have any worth of yourself.
[780.29] And it’s a dog job
[783.26] To always bark and keep his master satisfied.
[962.27] Someone killed such an important man of mine like a dog and I couldn’t even get to find out anything at all.
[973.29] Mr. Shah I saw the body myself.
[977.67] You’re right. 
[980.98] He died like a dog.
[987.33] Who can be so fearless 
[990.92] That he wants to mess with me?
 
[994.14] Mr. Shah if you need the truth
[996.20] Then I believe Kuki himself had a lot of quarrels.
[998.27] Everyday he indulged in disputes, fights, beatings. 
[1000.63] You are well aware of these things.
[1009.09] We need to set an example through this man.
[1013.68] Capture him alive.
[1016.20] Soon.
[1041.90] Yes Ehtisham.
[1043.42] How are you Bulla?
[1045.69] I’m fine. 
[1047.15] How’s Maham?
[1048.76] The same as before. 
[1049.77] But her parents have shifted here.
[1052.49] Okay.
[1054.30] Didn't you go to meet her again?
[1056.42] No man 
[1058.25] I can't see her in such a state.
[1060.33] Hmm.
[1064.66] But I will surely come. 
[1066.97] It may take some time.
[1070.58] I still have some pending work.
[1072.66] Okay.
[1073.77] Until then 
[1076.38] I want you to stay with Maham.
[1080.00] I know that 
[1081.07] she really respects you a lot and i also know that
 
[1083.53] You really remain busy in your orphanage..
 
[1085.61] Oh no no no no. I am just a common worker Bulla.
[1088.94] I am an orphan myself maybe that's why I can feel the pain of the orphans.
[1091.84] I just deal with the basic works so don't you worry.
[1093.84] I’ll stay with Maham. 
[1094.99] Take your time.
[1096.63] Thanks man.
[1126.29] Keep sitting. Keep sitting.
[1130.23] Tell me something.
[1132.39] I’ve heard that the previous SHO
[1134.44] Used to encounter a lot.
[1139.30] Where did he perform his encounters?
[1140.98] Show me the places.
[1272.66] Mr. Shah you’ve summoned me so late at this hour? 
[1275.31] Is everything okay?
[1277.60] Someone has spread a rumor.
[1279.87] What rumor?
[1281.25] That I have died.
[1283.67] My guys went to get some important stuff. 
[1287.35] They aren’t giving to them.
[1288.92] They are saying that until they don’t see me alive they won’t give the stuff.
[1294.04] Yes what is it? 
[1295.50] Yes I am coming. 
[1298.00] I have called over video isn’t that enough?
 
[1300.49] I’m coming.
[1302.77] Don’t take any tension Mr. Shah. 
[1305.56] Everything will be fine.
[1309.19] You’re in uniform today?
[1311.65] Nobody knows about the bad time. 
[1315.30] It can come at any time.
[1317.61] Hello? 
[1318.96] What? 
[1321.19] I told you that it’s a rumor
[1324.24] It’s a rumor. I’m coming!
[1327.77] Go.
[1346.70] Where is he at? Where is he?
[1350.74] Call him.
[1353.05] Call him quickly.
[1356.00] Shoe laces Mr. Shah. 
[1358.02] Your shoe laces are untied.
[1363.77] You call him quickly.
[1366.68] Let me just find that person who has spread this lie, I won’t spare him..
[1370.16] What lie?
[1396.49] This means Kuki was absolutely right in his claims.
[1400.49] I was feeding milk to a snake. Right?
[1403.58] Mr. Shah. 
[1405.18] Your “The End” was inevitable for one day surely.
[1410.89] Wy would you mind it?
[1413.90] After today 
[1416.32]  Before approaching Shah.
[1420.47] After today anyone would think for a thousand times 
[1423.00] I told you 
[1424.63] That I would make an example out of him.
[1427.02] I’ll make an example out of you now.
[1429.69] What do you think 
[1430.66] That a couple of policemen can arrest Shah?
[1433.56] They’ll arrest me?
[1435.31] You! And your parents! And your..
[1442.90] Sir..
[1448.85] It isn’t a film.
[1451.75] He kept speaking over and over again while being held at a gun point.
[1457.35] Come on guys. Carry and move him out.
[1482.28] I must say sir.
[1483.40] We acknowledge you.
[1485.63] Whatever you planned 
[1487.80] You fulfilled it.
[1489.74] One picture sir?
[1491.57] Which picture?
[1492.58] For the newspaper sir.
[1496.07] Everyone’s?
[1507.06] Smile guys!
[1518.56] I’m sure Maham will be very happy to hear this news.
[1521.27] Shah had killed so many innocent children.
[1524.28] Capturing him wouldn’t have been enough.
[1526.48] Thank you Bulla.
[1527.79] Oh no I should thank you instead.
[1529.55] For what?
[1531.41] You’ve supported me during such a difficult phase.
[1533.32] It’s okay man.
[1535.33] Anyways.
[1536.49] The children must be missing Maham a lot?
[1537.99] For sure. They were just talking about her yesterday.
[1540.70] We all miss her.
[1541.82] I’ll surely come and visit someday.
[1543.00] Yes sure.
[1544.08] Take care.
[1548.20]  Oh the orphanage’s roof collapsed last night.
[1550.69] Every children died.
[1553.21] Orphanage?
[1553.81] Where the parentless kids live.
[1555.04] The orphanage’s roof collapsed last night sir.
[1558.21] The roof collapsed? Which orphanage?
[1560.46] Sir the one Ehtisham runs.
[1563.12] What nonsense is this?
[1563.94] It’s true sir. 
[1565.00] We got to find out today that the whole insurance of the orphanage is on Ehtisham’s claim.
[1586.54] I can understand that you remain so busy.
[1589.83] Yes I just get to deal with this place’s insurance, maintenance. Nothing apart from these.
[1596.36] Because a few good people like me can’t make or bring any change to this country’s system.
[1606.77] Sir.
[1609.07] Sir.
[1610.29] Hmm
[1611.69] Sir you’ve 
[1613.36] got a transfer letter.
