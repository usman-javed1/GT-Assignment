It’s my wedding but instead you
seem to be tensed. What happened? Nothing. Something’s wrong. Ever since you’re here you
haven’t even talked nor you’ve even told me off from anything. You haven’t even abused me. Something’s definitely up
that’s what I’m sure about. Tell me something. What? Am I bad person? Who said that to you? Tell me. I don’t know about being good
or bad. But my life has surely changed
because of you. I’ve left the wrong ways. My mom is happy because of me. So someone like you can’t be a
bad person. That’s what I’m sure about. Something’s wrong. Look at me. Did you have a fight with your
girl? How do you know? Because I behave in the same
way when I fight with my girl. You’re fighting just before
being married? Oh yes daily. She texts me with why I haven’t
greeted her with a good morning? I respond with why can’t you
wish me yourself? It’s not compulsory for me only. We fight daily. And we get
normal together. So who compromises you or her? I have to be the one who has to
mend everything. How? By begging. Begging heavily. I just don’t leave any space. I
just keep texting with endless texts of sorry. I tell her that you’re standing
on the edge and I’m drowning. And I’m probably going to die. Yes... What? But you don’t have to do this. All you have to do is apologize
once from your heart. What if she doesn’t accept it? Then you have to apologize
again. There isn’t any rocket science in it. You just have to beg and beg. Hold her legs or something.
Grab her feet. With every simplicity just be
stubborn about it. And she’ll agree. Just like that. Just keep smiling like this. Sadness doesn’t suit you at all. Thank you. And when she agrees, do tell
her about me as well. That it was my idea. I’ll let her know for sure. In
fact I’ll make her meet you. When you’d want to introduce me
let me know a day before. I’ll make sure that I groom myself
properly. Shave myself decently and be
presentable Full.. You’re a big film you know that? And a top one. I’m way bigger than “Kuch Kuch
Hota Hai” film. I know a lot happens to you. Maham can you hand me that last
week’s survey file? What’s up? Why are you so silent today? Not really. There’s nothing
like that. Are you sure? Are you trying to say that you
aren’t distracted? Why are you asking me again and
again? Good. Very Good. Because I... didn’t ask for
this file. What is Bulla’s problem? On one hand he listens to
everything I say. And on the other side he
becomes so stubborn that he doesn’t even accept anything. This is so frustrating. You cannot even imagine. Listen these things often tend
to happen in relationships. Don’t worry. This isn’t a “let go” thing. Look. We caught the drug dealer. He named “Shah” as responsible. And Bulla let him go. Now you tell me yourself he
isn’t a coward right? How can he let him go unless he
is hiding something from me? Look. It’s his job to keep a
look out on such people. You need to trust him in such a
situation And he’ll eventually figure out
a way to this. You should relax. Now I’ll only relax after Shah
gets caught. What? You’ll get Shah caught? Am I not capable enough for
that? You Maham.. You can do everything. Anyways. If you need my help in this
case in any way just let me know. Thank you. It means a lot to me. You’re welcome. Kindly hand me the right file
this time please. Thank you. A five. Take your turn quickly. Either way I’m winning. Yeah right you’re winning. Here’s a five. I see. My turn. Hello? This time? Why? Okay I’m coming. Take your turn quickly. Have some patience. Oh wow ice cream. Win this now. Bro! Welcome, welcome, welcome. Mr. Bulla. Where’s Shah? Don’t you know? You’re more closer to him than
me these days. Quit messing around, come to
the point. Mr. Shah didn’t come but he did
arrange a special task for you. What? A couple of guys have robbed
the factory. And Mr. Shah only has one
principle. The penalty for theft is Murder. I’m not going to murder anyone. You’re not even up to it I know
that. Leave that to me. Don’t worry. Water. Water. Give me some water. What happened? Do you know him? No. I mean.. I saw him at the station. He’s just a pick-pocketer. So you... Don’t have any personal
affiliations with him right? No. Right, right, right. Had he stuck to those small
petty thefts He would’ve lived. This freak has directly grabbed
the hand of death. Listen hand him over to me,
I’ll deal with him myself.. No Mr. Bulla no.... No Mr. Bulla this isn’t your
task. This is my responsibility. You have some other work to
attend to. Right? Have you ever encountered
someone Mr. Bulla? Encounter? You’re just a new crop in the
field what would you know anything about an encounter? But if you have to go along
with us For long term .... Then you’ll have learn such a
work. Don’t worry. I’ll teach you. After killing a man you have to
dispose his body like.. The poor chap is feeling the
pain.. Forget him. Listen to me. After killing someone you have
made the dead body seem like as if that person died during an
encounter. You have fire twice in his back
and not a single bullet in the front. So that it may seem in the
report that he was shot while running away. Right? Bulla? Are you listening Bulla? Bulla! Are you listening? What’s wrong? Are you alright? You’re witnessing something
like this for the first time that’s why you feel lost right? Don’t worry. You don’t need to feel anxious. You’ll get the hang of it next
time. It’s happened for the first
time in fornt of you. Go now. Go. Hello Mr. Shah. Yes Mr. Shah I’ve explained
everything to Bulla. It’s probably his first time
that’s why he's a bit scared. Yes Mr. Shah. Yes yes. He was just scared. But that’s okay, we’ve taught
him well. Don’t you worry. He’ll remember for sure. Yes. Okay. Okay. Oh pick up his dead body
already or do you want to take a selfie with it? Dispose of it. Clean this up. Hello? Yes Ehtisham I was looking at
some of the orphanage files and I found a few flaws in them. Flaws? What sort of flaws? I can’t tell you like this.
Let’s meet at the office tomorrow then I’ll explain to
you. Yes yes sure. All good right? Yes. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. Bulla? Son where are you going? Have some breakfast. I’m not hungry. Bulla? Son.. Where is Jamshaid? There’s so much work to do. Let him come back today. I’ll teach him a lesson. Son. Son you know what? Where ever Jamshaid may wander,
he always comes back home before night. You aren't saying anything? Where is he? Is he... Is he alright son? He’s no more. No more? What.. What.. What are you saying? You’re lying. You’re lying. He has to.. He has yet to get married. What are you saying? You’re lying. Go bring him. He used to consider you as his
elder brother. You were like an elder brother
to him. Where were you at that time? Where were you? Where were you? Go somewhere and bring him back.
.... Sir what’s wrong? You’re so
quiet tonight. Sir I suggest you to have a
peck anyhow tonight. Hey what if sir smacks you
instead of it? Grab your senses. Sir The elders say that when the
weight increases It’s better to share it. As one can even fall down
because of heavy weights. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. I didn’t understand. Sir? Back already son? You must be hungry. Shall i serve you food? I’m not hungry. Hello Inspector Bulla? Yes? Bulla it’s me Ehtisham. Maham works with me in the
orphanage. Yes Ehtisham? I was trying to calling you Actually Maham has had an accident. And she’s in a critical
condition. What? Please come to the city
hospital quickly. Where’s Maham? In the ICU. What happened? Accident. She was coming to meet me at
