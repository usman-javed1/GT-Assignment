Where’s Maham? In the ICU What happened? Accident. She was coming to meet me at the office. And during the way someone.. Someone called me from the last dialed number and I came over. She has a head injury. How is she now doctor? The head injury was very severe  because of which the patient is in a state of coma. I’m sorry we are trying our best. Doctor ahhmm.. What do you mean she’s in a coma? What do you mean she’s in a coma? Don’t worry.  She’ll recover soon. Everyone’s blasting fireworks.  But you’re just playing with matchsticks. What’s wrong bro? I’ve never seen you like this before. Nothing like this has ever happened before as well. What happened? At least tell me. It’s out of my understanding. You know what? I recently got to study about karma.
  Whatever someone does with another It rotates and comes right back at him. If you’ve been wronged  Then you must’ve wronged someone before. Areeba.  Please tell me the truth. Am I a bad person? Bro. You’re such a nice man.  For real. If dad had been alive  He would’ve been so happy to see you. And who doesn’t have flaws in themselves?  Tell me. The actual thing is to make sure that flaw doesn’t succeed. And what if it succeeds? Then my teacher says  Try Try again Till you succeed. If you give up trying then it means  You’ve surrendered yourself before your flaws. Isn’t that right? What are you doing mom? I’m sewing up your shirt’s button what else? What?  What are you doing? Mom you carry on with your work.  Let me get some peace. Really?  Even after you’ve grown up? Have it your way. Have your peace.
  Dad? Where did you go? I’ve cut some regretful deals dad. It’s alright.  Learn from these mistakes  And don’t repeat them again. That’s all. Dad..  I’m such a bad person. Sometimes our inner flaws  Tend to overpower our goodness. And  Overpowering isn’t an issue. It’s just that  Your flaws never ought to win And son  Your inner goodness is still alive. Forgive me dad. The greed for money  Turned me blind. Nobody turns blind son.  It’s just  that sometimes  People tend to lose their visions. Your visions have still a long way to go.  You still have your visions. Bastard. Name? Wajahat. Gender? I.. What’s your gender? I’m a male. You’re not a male. You’re just a prick who raises his hands on his wife and kids. Males like you  Only have a single pride to rely on. Your masculinity. Wajahat.  If your wife or kids ever complain again  Then believe me I don’t even know myself of what I’ll do to you. Understood? Leave. We’ve been wearing the uniform since so long. It’s time to actually fulfil its responsibility now. Sir  What do we have to do? Hey make sure you that you deliver the whole goods with care at the drop point. Make sure there are no problems. I’ll join after getting free from here. Hang up now. Hey.. Bulla what are you doing here? There were some pending settlements to make. Thought I’d fulfil them. You think you can make any settlements? Did you forget How I tore off your book? How were you crying and asking..  Please hand him over to me. I’ll deal with him myself. How was the pain and agony? I was enjoying. Bulla your game’s over. Finished. Shah will kill you himself. Get out from here. You’ve got that right All the time “Shah” “Shah” “Shah”. You don’t even have any worth of yourself. And it’s a dog job To always bark and keep his master satisfied. Someone killed such an important man of mine like a dog and I couldn’t even get to find out anything at all. Mr. Shah I saw the body myself. You’re right.  He died like a dog. Who can be so fearless  That he wants to mess with me?
  Mr. Shah if you need the truth Then I believe Kuki himself had a lot of quarrels. Everyday he indulged in disputes, fights, beatings.  You are well aware of these things. We need to set an example through this man. Capture him alive. Soon. Yes Ehtisham. How are you Bulla? I’m fine.  How’s Maham? The same as before.  But her parents have shifted here. Okay. Didn't you go to meet her again? No man  I can't see her in such a state. Hmm. But I will surely come.  It may take some time. I still have some pending work. Okay. Until then  I want you to stay with Maham. I know that  she really respects you a lot and i also know that
  You really remain busy in your orphanage..
  Oh no no no no. I am just a common worker Bulla. I am an orphan myself maybe that's why I can feel the pain of the orphans. I just deal with the basic works so don't you worry. I’ll stay with Maham.  Take your time. Thanks man. Keep sitting. Keep sitting. Tell me something. I’ve heard that the previous SHO Used to encounter a lot. Where did he perform his encounters? Show me the places. Mr. Shah you’ve summoned me so late at this hour?  Is everything okay? Someone has spread a rumor. What rumor? That I have died. My guys went to get some important stuff.  They aren’t giving to them. They are saying that until they don’t see me alive they won’t give the stuff. Yes what is it?  Yes I am coming.  I have called over video isn’t that enough?
  I’m coming. Don’t take any tension Mr. Shah.  Everything will be fine. You’re in uniform today? Nobody knows about the bad time.  It can come at any time. Hello?  What?  I told you that it’s a rumor It’s a rumor. I’m coming! Go. Where is he at? Where is he? Call him. Call him quickly. Shoe laces Mr. Shah.  Your shoe laces are untied. You call him quickly. Let me just find that person who has spread this lie, I won’t spare him.. What lie? This means Kuki was absolutely right in his claims. I was feeding milk to a snake. Right? Mr. Shah.  Your “The End” was inevitable for one day surely. Wy would you mind it? After today   Before approaching Shah. After today anyone would think for a thousand times  I told you  That I would make an example out of him. I’ll make an example out of you now. What do you think  That a couple of policemen can arrest Shah? They’ll arrest me? You! And your parents! And your.. Sir.. It isn’t a film. He kept speaking over and over again while being held at a gun point. Come on guys. Carry and move him out. I must say sir. We acknowledge you. Whatever you planned  You fulfilled it. One picture sir? Which picture? For the newspaper sir. Everyone’s? Smile guys! I’m sure Maham will be very happy to hear this news. Shah had killed so many innocent children. Capturing him wouldn’t have been enough. Thank you Bulla. Oh no I should thank you instead. For what? You’ve supported me during such a difficult phase. It’s okay man. Anyways. The children must be missing Maham a lot? For sure. They were just talking about her yesterday. We all miss her. I’ll surely come and visit someday. Yes sure. Take care.  Oh the orphanage’s roof collapsed last night. Every children died. Orphanage? Where the parentless kids live. The orphanage’s roof collapsed last night sir. The roof collapsed? Which orphanage? Sir the one Ehtisham runs. What nonsense is this? It’s true sir.  We got to find out today that the whole insurance of the orphanage is on Ehtisham’s claim. I can understand that you remain so busy. Yes I just get to deal with this place’s insurance, maintenance. Nothing apart from these. Because a few good people like me can’t make or bring any change to this country’s system. Sir. Sir. Hmm Sir you’ve  got a transfer letter.
