Okay bro. It’s not fair man.  You’re leaving us. Let him go.  It’s understandable Just don’t forget us after moving to the city.
  How can I ever forget you lunatics? New city,  New people  and new challenges Oh Bulla you’re going to need a new changeovers Oh Rihanna.  How do I look then? Yeah yeah. Evil eyes off me baby.
  What’s up? Hands up. Yeah that’s right. Get out of here. So you finally got me to wear the uniform. Sir! Look mom.  How does your son look?
  God bless you Very handsome. Oh I miss him. Areeba hasn’t woken up yet I don’t why she’s sleeping for so long. Look mom. Mom listen. Death leaves a bitter impression mom. And life has even worse. Yet we still have to live it through. Areeba will now go to college.  I will go to the police station.
  But you? We have to change.  All of us together. Seems like you’ve become mature. I’ve matured since quite a while.   You just got to know it now. Naughty boy. The name’s Inspector Bulla. And this is my station! Constable Mohsin reporting sir! Hey..  What is this? This is the Gulab Town Station sir. That’s okay, but what is its condition? The condition is a bit off But if you can ignore a few things then the scene is quite okay sir.
 
  Come on sir, let me give you a tour of the station. Sit down, sit down. what is this state of the station?
  It's just mess all around Slow down. Sir! Yeah Mohsin, has the senior officer arrived? Yes sir is inside. Inspector Bulla. Sir!...Welcome.   How was your journey? The journey was fine, but  What is this state of the station?
  We’ve submitted the application for such funds since so many years. Who’s desk is that? ASI Jamshaid Asad. Why isn’t he here yet? He’s usually late. Provided if he comes. Isn’t he conscious of losing his job? Oh sir he’s a special recruit by the SHO. Get an idea from that. Who else is around here? Sir constable Mohsin. Sir! Me, ASI Jamshaid, Sohail the clerk and the rest of all are random constables and moving insects. That’s all. And what about the SHO? Sir we’ve stopped asking about such a thing since more than a year now. Anyways. Welcome to the Gulab Town Police Station sir! Hands up! Mom come on. Come here, come quick. At least keep the door locked. What difference does it make? We used to keep it open in the village. This isn’t the village anymore, we’re in the city now. Nobody enters without permission here. They ring the bell, the bell. My name is Bulla What is this commotion? Please turn it off. At least something’s happening. Otherwise it’s pin drop silence all day long. No noise, no one to hear, no one to talk to. At least I’m hearing something. Where is Areeba? She’s in her room. She’s angry with you. Why? Go and ask her yourself. Mom tell me! She feels that your father died because of the troubles and miseries you caused him. It’s alright son. Everything will be just fine, don’t you worry. What have you brought? I got her admitted in college  So I brought her new uniform. Wow.  Go give it to her. Go on, go give it to her.
  Areeba I know you’re awake. I brought you your new uniform. I’ve got you admitted into college. Be ready in the morning. Welcome I came because of mom Do something Then you'll say change is not happening When I saw you. I lost my senses. Wow Hot hot tea, hot hot tea. Hot hot tea Hot hot.. Hot.. Where did it spill? On the hand. Yesssss.. Dropped on the hand.. Sir Quit massaging us! Back to your cells! Sir Welcome Mr. Jamshaid. Sir See I told you, everyone knows me around here. I told him about you. It’s good that you’re here sir. I’ve brought you a special memo from the SHO. Wow New Air Conditioner. Microwave. Motorbike. Kid’s school fees. What’s all of this? Itinerary sir. Which Itinerary? Expenditures. For this month that we need to favor him with. Whatever else that we consume, he doesn’t have any issue with it sir. He’s rare to see around, but he has a great heart sir. From this day onwards.. First of all we’ll consume. And after that. We’ll still consume. Sir... And make sure you arrive on time from tomorrow. He’s new around here, he’ll learn eventually. Mom please serve me some food. Hello Sir it’s me Inspector Jamshaid. Yes? Sir the SHO has called you over to his place. At this hour? Yes sir. He’s waiting for you. Okay I’m coming. Mom cancel the order for the food. So you’re Inspector Bulla. Sir! I heard that you teared up my memo. I’ve come across a lot of you old school rural folks. Who think they can make a difference in the status quo. Who think they change the culture of the stations and the whole country. But to no avail. Everything functions around here with my own consent and will. I’ll throw you out. I’m elder than you. And you should listen to your elders. Hasn’t your father taught you anything? What did you say? Umm nothing. Father what? Nothing. Don’t you want some tea?  Serve us some tea! What I meant was that you and I are going to head the station together. So I just wanted to discuss some stuff and take suggestions. Who told you that i've come here to promote honesty Corruption will strive.  But only according to my own terms. You don’t need to come to the station. You’ll get your shares. But here’s the thing.  The station will only function according to my own terms What do you say? Right you are. That station will function according to your own terms. Hmm the apple is quite delicious. Yes, just like your statements. But I say. The memo that I sent regarding the itinerary.  The Microwave, the kid’s school fees, clothes and etc. If I could just have those you know? Bless you. Your uniform looks really charming on you. I'll take my leave Mohsin!  Mohsin! Hello sir. Whom are you looking for sir? You can’t find anyone around here. Everyone hide themselves after seeing me. Hide themselves? Why? I don’t know. They don’t even register my report sir. I have a case of “missing” sir. Kindly help me out with it. He’s lying sir. You shouldn’t believe him at all sir. Hey you! Get out of here! Can’t you hear me? He’s the biggest liar of the century sir. I’m telling you to get up and buzz the hell out of here! Get out of here. Are you deaf or what? Silence! What the hell are you guys up to? He has a “missing” case. Is this a police station or a mental institute? Don’t you worry. I’ll register your case. Thank you sir. You’re so kind enough. It’s a report regarding ‘missing’. Who is missing? My rooster. Okay, so you’re rooster is missing. Since when? It’s been a week now.  I searched for him so much, but he’s nowhere to be found. We’ll find him, we’ll find him for sure. Now tell me, where was the last place that you saw him at? On a parapet of a wall. On the parapet of a wall. How does your rooster look? On a parapet every rooster is a white colored one. There is a white rooster on the parapet of the wall. Silence! Take this crazy rooster guy away from here! Get lost! Sir I told you before. Get up you.. I’ll bring the revolution of the roosters!

I’ll need your data base for the app that I’m trying to develop. Areeba! Listen to me.. What’s wrong? You’re asking me what’s wrong? You don’t even have any idea about the sort of fanatics I’m coming across at the police station. And then the worse traffic of this city. Bro you do know that I’m pissed off right? No no please. Please don’t be angry. See I’ve brought you something. Don’t worry sir. I’ll sort out the whole files and folders myself.  And you’ll not regret this decision of yours. Ready? Ready? Take a look at it. It’s like one in a million stupid. Bro stop teasing me please. Look.. Look  I swear you look like “Madhuballa” Bro stop teasing me please. I know. I know you’re blushing.
