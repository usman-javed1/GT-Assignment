Please go away from here. I’ll break your door now. It’s a very fragile door if you tend to break it. Please take it easy. Then open it right now. Okay okay I’ll open it.  Step away please.

Try to understand. Yeah right? And what if you create more problems for me instead? Is your landlord’s name Mian Mehmood? Jamshaid the landlord is here!

I wish our bad days go away now. God willingly why not mom. Hey where’s the tea? Don’t worry son I’ll bring it right away. Tea Oh I hope the bed doesn’t break. I like this bed. This is my home. Not a resort. Hey! By the way thank you. Remember our deal okay? Oh yes don’t you worry. How’s your college going? It’s going good.  You know I’ve made a new friend.  And she lives nearby our home.
  I told her that she and I can go back home together.  So that you won’t have to come and pick me up. No way.  Are you crazy? We don’t even know who she is or what sort of a girl is she. No way. Mom I’ve matured.  I can realize what’s good or bad for myself. You haven’t grown that big yet.   You’re still young.  Here take this I know better than you at least. What do you mean? Areeba These aren’t dad’s principles. Had it been for dad’s values  we wouldn’t even have afforded to live in the city. Can’t you see that I’m sitting here? Both of you always keep fighting. Behave yourselves. Stupid. Hand me the bread. Bulla go and see what’s going on. Mom it’s like a daily thing of theirs. Ignore them. What?  You’re a police officer I don’t get involved in domestic affairs. So shouldn’t you. Come on have dinner. I don’t get involved in domestic affairs.  So shouldn’t you. Come on have dinner. Okay I’m going.  I can’t even eat in peace. You can eat when you come back, I’ll warm it up for you then. I’ll slap you on your face! Do you understand me? Go on hit me. What else can you do? What have you done in your whole life  Except wasted every single penny that you’ve earned till today. What more can you do? I know how I run the house. Who has done everything? Who bears the whole expenditures of the home? Who pays the bills for electricity? Sui gas bills?
-I’m leaving
-Where do you eat from? Hey What the hell is going on here? What’s up with you? She’s my wife! You.. You think you can beat her if she’s your wife? Go on hit her. Who the hell are you? Who are you? Inspector Bulla! If I take you to the station and thrash you  You won’t be able to even sit down properly for the rest of your life. Sir. Sir please let him go. Sir. Sir please forgive him. Do you enjoy getting beat up by him? At least care for your little one? Sir please just forgive us. This is our own personal affair. If it’s personal then keep it behind your closed doors! Hey let’s go. Let’s leave. What now? Get going!  All bystanders! Get inside your homes! Bulla? Are you satisfied now? “where should I head to after changing my clothes?” Yeah Oh we couldn’t meet at my place. So I thought why not here instead. We’ll keep changing our locations, don’t worry. Oh so you asked me that day about the most prominent figures around this city right? Well the names of “Kuki Shah” and “Muni Aunty” are in that relevant list. “Kuki Shah & “Muni Aunty”. I hope you’ll remember. Now tell me about their locations. As for “Muni Aunty”, she is based around… Kuki bro?   Kuki bro? Please wake up.  See I’ve brought you your favorite “Lassi”. It’s so chilled that you’ll enjoy it at its peak.
  Here you go. You wake me up so often. Seems like an earthquake. This is much bigger than an earthquake.  Something different. Ahh to hell with it. Couldn’t open this up. It’s such a heavy door. I tried my best  but it wouldn’t move at all. It spoiled my macho entry!  Could’ve oiled it at least! What’s going on? Long time, no see eh? I’m coming.. Kuki bro  This is Inspector Bulla. It seems by the tension on your face and by the way of your sitting position that.. You’re Kuki. Inspector Bulla. And I beat openly! Ahhh hhaaaa aahhhaa! What a rhyme! So  Haven’t you told him? So? I’ve heard a lot about your business ventures.  So I thought I’d see it for myself. Seems like this goof wants to open a shop or something.  Hand over some stock to this wolf. Seems like you wish an early death for yourself. A side business.  Unlawful. Don’t mess around with my temper.  I’m already pissed off! Get out of here. Hey! And before my temper gets out of control it’s better that you turn up at the station tomorrow. On time. Oh Lassi. At least be generous with the sugar? Spoiled my mood. Be on time tomorrow. Okay? I’ll take my leave. Oh Bulla! Try to play as much as you have your ground. Or else you’ll regret it. Shah won’t spare you. Get up! Still laying on my floor! Call up Shah. Ahh what? Call Shah on the phone right now! Bastard Wow you’ve surely won our hearts. Oh my God. Do really gorgeous men like you wear such uniforms these days as well? Get away! Went directly for the pistol. What? Welcome. Welcome sir. Have a seat. Will you smoke? Oh no no. Smoking Kills. So how come did you turn up here in our poor center? Oh no no. Don’t call it poor center. Call it a prostitute center. A prostitute center. I like your humor.  I’m quite moved Ahh. The way you speak the literary Urdu.  It’s just amazing. Where do you learn it from? It’s our traditional language.  Lucknow’s air.. Lucknow You’re not even the starting “L”  Hey! Come straight to the point boy! Ahh.  Here’s comes the natural language from the inside. Whatever the business you’re running around here. I don’t have an issue with that. I have an issue with your side business. What do you mean? Oh Uncle! Have you tea already. Or do you want to get it cold? Look Muni Aunty.  These dances, functions and such gatherings.  I was referring towards other stuff that you do besides  It’s pay-back time for those things. And that too inside Inspector Bulla’s court. Anyways You may enjoy for the evening.  Let’s meet tomorrow at the station. Hey! You’ll regret it. Only a fool can say such a thing who doesn’t even know about Shah himself. Come on resume it now? Give me give me. Why didn’t you tell me about Shah? Everyone took his name except you. Why? I did say “Kuki Shah” “Muni Aunty”. Don’t you remember? Oh these are two separate names. Kuki and Shah. Was your uncle going to come and tell me that this isn’t a single person’s name? Why did you lie to me? I swear I didn’t lie to you. Whoever lied is such a big mother fu****… May his motorbike tyre get punctured.. I’ll puncture you for sure. I didn’t lie. Hello. Who? Where? Shah has called me. If something happens to me tomorrow then I’ll surely do something to you.. I’ll puncture you for an eternity. Man, what the hell.. I said “Kuki Shah” “Muni Aunty”  Happy birthday to you..
Happy birthday to you.. Please serve everything to the kids, I’ll be right back. I’ll be back in five minutes. Come on now. Come quick. My son is waiting for me. So you’re Inspector Bulla? Do you know me? If you want to know the truth then..  No. Where are you from? From Alipur. A village? Aren’t you scared? I don’t fear anyone except God. My dad taught me this. Rural people have a very strange fire within themselves right? That’s true. I get can get you killed right away. I’m aware.  But I know you won’t do that. Why? Because you don’t like spilling blood. I see. I have a very strong connection with your SHO. You’ll get your share. Sir your business... Can grow even more. How come? I believe in the concept of giving and taking. Have you hear about “Aslam Bagh”? Yes. It’s near my village. That area can be very beneficial for my business. But there’s a home of a woman there  Her name is “Begum Durdana”. She’s very stubborn. But I have a few principles that I follow. No murder. No rape And especially not in this task. Otherwise this land will go over to the government. Can it be done? Mr. Shah. What have you done? If you sense enmity then turn them into your support. I have placed him in a situation If he succeeds then we will walk along with him. Oh Mr. Shah.  What difference would a single situation make?   So we’ll put him in another. Don’t worry. Oh Mr. Shah if you want me to shoot him then tell me. A bullet isn’t always the solution to every problem. Did you have the cake? Eat it before you leave. My wife has made it herself. Get out of my way. Sir. Yeah? Someone’s here to see you sir. Okay send them in. Not here sir. Why not here? In the “R-CHIEVES”. “R-CHIVES”? Sir the store room. Where you’ll find the files and darkness and the spot lights. The party of extasy.. Hey! Sorry sir. Behave yourself. Where now? Over here sir. Ahhhaa. Enjoyment. Enjoyment. Enjoyment. I never knew you had such a skill as well. Which one? Reading the file upside down. By the way.. Why are you making this app? The numbers are in front you. It show’s a dire need for it don’t you think so? I thought maybe it must’ve been your personal interest. Yeah that too.  My parents passed away when I was a child. I’ve come across a lot of difficulties in life. But fortunately I was taken in by a good family. Now I just want to do everything for all the orphans out there. I’m sorry. It’s okay. Actually  A few months ago my father died as well. Oh. He was also in the police. But he was a man of strict rules. Seems like you don’t like this that much? What? His taste for rules. Actually  Between good and bad. There’s a very fine thin line. Oh. So you don’t even regard the difference between goodness and badness. Yes but.. You only do what you think is right. It’s even possible  that your goodness may cause harm to someone else. Does it even matter? The important thing is that you stick to do goodness. No. I think you should do whatever you can benefit from. Rules are important to follow within this life.  Otherwise people may find themselves lost. I have a rule.  But it’s most likely that people won’t appreciate it. Okay. Till whatever extent you feel satisfied you should do that then.  And the day you start feeling dissatisfied just don’t go all silent then. Thank you. Come I’ll drop you. I don’t like taking favors. It does take time but I do everything on my own. Okay don’t take any favor.  At least have some tea then? I don’t like tea. Samosas? Dahai Bhallas? At least have some water? Everybody consumes water. Oh Bulla. Sir. Sir.. Sir! Sir are you alright? Yeah I’m okay. What’s up? You ordered some complaint files of Durdana Begum. Nice Sir. What is this about? For moving ahead.. It’s a shortcut!
