[5.00] So did you enjoy at the party?
[8.63] Yes I enjoyed a lot.
[12.59] I like the fact that you
enjoyed.
[16.20] When I called you, why didn’t
you come?
[20.00] Actually I..
[21.08] I don’t like to wait.
[25.19] Don’t do this again.
[29.09] Your shoe laces are open.
[35.82] Even the shoes cost ten hundred
thousand rupees
[39.83] It always stay in the feets.
[49.68] Things never forget their worth.
[57.03] Humans forget it.
[60.98] Goodnight
[121.06] Tea?
[123.05] Thank you.
[124.24] The NGO’s financial report is
almost ready.
[127.48] I’ll work on it tonight and
submit it to you by tomorrow.
[131.66] How do you work so hard like
this?
[134.65] I just try.
[136.90] That’s all.
[138.67] By the way
[139.58] Seriously... I really want to
know.
[142.65] How do you find so much
motivation for it?
[147.07] Let’s just say ever since my
childhood then.
[149.62] And through my parents who
adopted me.
[153.13] Sometimes I think, had it not
been for them, I wouldn’t have
[155.50] stood anywhere in my life.
[157.63] So that’s why you try and keep
helping such kids?
[161.70] Yes. But not as much as you do.
[163.79] I mean you’re always around
them 24/7.
[166.86] How can someone do so much for
someone else?
[169.92] No It’s nothing like that.
[171.76] It is exactly like this.
[175.28] Well
[176.67] You’re adopted as well right?
[178.16] You’ve never shared how your
experience has been through this.
[181.42] I still don’t know till today
[183.39] Why I was adopted?
[186.15] Maybe because my parents wanted
to do some goodness in this
[188.45] world.
[191.25] But they weren’t that close to
me.
[196.39] I couldn’t even imagine..
[198.42] That your childhood could’ve
been like that.
[201.03] Regardless of that you have
such positivity.
[203.12] How?
[204.39] Because what i went through.
[207.09] I don’t want these kids to go
through the same.
[209.34] If some guys like you get to
become a part of our political
[212.29] system
[213.95] then I swear the destiny of
this country can change
[215.92] completely.
[217.92] Still nothing will change.
[220.33] Why?
[221.82] Because even a few guys like me
can’t change the whole system
[224.26] of the country.
[226.31] The whole nation should give
input. Right?
[231.75] You know what should be done
about such people?
[236.62] They should be killed.
[244.53] What’s wrong? I’m just kidding.
[256.65] Sir.
[265.03] It’s alright Mr. Manager.
[266.22] Alright.
[266.72] You don’t have to worry.
[268.37] We’ll do your work.
[269.40] Okay.
[269.60] Our officer is really hard
working.
[271.85] You can see him right here.
[274.60] He’s a little busy.
[275.78] Anyways, please make sure the
tea is bit more warm next time.
[279.08] Sir doesn’t like it cold.
[280.47] Don’t worry.
[281.90] Sir.
[287.18] You’re playing really cool sir.
[289.68] Kill him at least.
[290.67] Kill him.
[305.64] Sir
[307.94] Sir!
[308.86] Can’t you see I’m playing the
game?
[310.63] You’re playing the game here
and someone’s placing the game
[313.01] over there.
[323.14] It’s our sister in law.
[324.72] And she’s on a date.
[331.52] Who’s that monkey with her?
[334.49] Let’s go check it out.
[338.20] So what do you think about this
idea?
[339.61] What do you think?
[340.25] I think it’s a great idea
actually.
[341.89] I’m very excited to go and have
our businesses together. I
[344.62] think we can benefit from it.
[345.98] Okay so..
[346.94] Who are you?
[347.61] What’s going on here?
[348.76] Bulla what are you doing here?
[349.96] Who is he?
[351.44] Introduce me.

[353.83] Inspector Bulla?
[354.86] He is Inspector Bulla. He is
this area’s..
[357.23] No. You be quiet.
[359.80] Let me handle.
[361.08] Who are you?
[362.37] Where have you come from?
[363.72] You seem like a youtuber from
your face.
[365.75] In fact you look like a
Tik-Toker.
[367.76] Put him in the car.
[369.35] Mohsin
[369.80] What are you doing?
[370.41] Oh hello!
[371.42] What is this? He’s call me a
Tik-Toker.
[373.25] Actually
[374.17] He’s just a friend..
[375.62] Yes.
[376.62] You’ve said that right.
[377.62] Friend. .
[379.00] And a special one
[380.82] I have another friend here.
[383.64] Say hello to my little friend.
[385.14] What are you doing?
[387.20] Meet him.
[388.86] Maham.
[389.99] What is this?
[391.61] Is this guy a psychopath or
something?
[393.69] I’m really sorry. I can fix
this.
[395.62] Hold on.
[396.95] What’s a psychopath?
[398.12] Psychopath?
[399.43] Path.
[400.80] Yes path sir..
[401.44] Yes path. Path. There’s just
one path for you now.
[404.24] Exit path. Go on.
[405.86] Bulla!
[406.57] You know what Maham?
[407.98] You know what Maham? I’m sorry
but I’m going to have to leave
[410.27] now. This is getting
unprofessional and I’m out of
[412.56] hands. And by the way please,
please don’t call me again.
[414.96] Please thank you.
[417.72] And yes you.
[419.54] I can’t believe you called me a
Tik-Toker.
[424.55] I’m a Snacker.
[426.09] I have seventeen thousand eight
hundred and ninety followers.
[433.72] And yes.
[435.47] I’m not interested in girls.
[442.90] He doesn’t seem straight to me.
[445.80] See how scared he was?
[447.59] Sissy.
[448.24] I’m so intimidating.
[452.17] Did I say something wrong?
[457.70] You’re still thinking if you’ve
said anything wrong?
[460.97] Do you know who he was?
[462.62] He was my app’s potential
investor.
[464.51] Whom you have ridiculed, scared
and threatened so much so that
[466.66] he ran off.
[468.57] But Maham I..
[469.34] I, you, he.. What?
[474.87] Listen to me Bulla.
[476.98] I haven’t given you the right
to interfere in my life like
[478.86] this!
[481.95] Maham?
[491.80] Did you see how scared he was?
[492.93] Exactly sir.
[493.93] You as well.
[497.25] Grab my pistol.
[504.00] Yes?
[507.14] Sir. I’ve narrated everything
to you.
[510.26] Believe me sir. I was just
pulling the car out..
[514.68] Sir I.. I.. I..
[515.88] Sir look I.. Please understand..
[517.99] I was just..
[519.63] Hey Goshi!
[521.38] Stop it. You can play when we
get home.
[523.21] No!
[524.25] Hey!
[543.67] Hey you!
[570.37] Tell me. What’s the problem?
[578.86] Hey tell me..
[584.57] Tell me..
[586.00] Ahh well umm..
[595.70] Umm nothing sir..
[597.47] Nothing happened..
[600.60] Nothing happened at all..
[608.42] Goshi dear
[609.36] Goshi son please give this to
us..
[626.58] Back to work everyone.
[633.90] What’s up with sir?
[635.23] Has he gone crazy?
[636.62] He had a fight with sister in
law.
[638.10] Oh.
[658.09] With extreme caution and care..
[660.19] I’m telling you that the news
I’m hearing around isn’t good
[662.22] at all.
[664.64] I advise you to be careful with
that Kuki.
[667.84] He’s very pissed off.
[670.17] He’s just jealous.
[672.44] He can’t bear finding me more
close to Mr. Shah
[674.96] Whatever it may be..
[676.22] He’s a very dangerous person.
[677.74] He can do anything.
[680.05] Don’t you worry.
[681.88] I’ll take care of him.
[683.37] Why would I be worried?
[685.30] I only had to inform you which
I have done.
[687.19] In fact
[688.40] I remember..
[689.46] This.
[692.12] For you
[692.81] What’s this?
[699.77] Oh I see...
[701.68] I’m getting married.
[703.15] Next week?
[704.01] Yes.
[705.01] You seem to be in a hurry.
[706.11] That’s how it is.
[707.22] Slow down or you’ll get a
ticket.
[709.48] You should also get married.
[711.15] When will you marry?
[714.08] I will when I’ll be worthy of
it.
[718.12] Seems like there is someone.
[720.31] Right? Right?
[722.49] Tell me the next thing?
[723.75] I don’t care if somebody dances
or not but I will dance for
[725.60] sure on your wedding.
[726.90] In a whole joyful moment when
there will be bank notes flying
[728.34] all over.
[730.53] “The night of your wedding
celebrations”
[735.56] Everything will be mine.
[756.63] Hello hi
[758.43] Hi.
[761.01] I just wanted to say that I’m
really sorry for today.
[764.38] I guess I said a bit of too
much to you.
[766.80] No no why are you apologizing?
[769.20] Actually it was my fault.
[771.42] Is it the first time you’ve had
a woman in your life?
[774.45] Oh no no.
[776.49] So did you behave like this
with the rest of them?
[780.44] I’ve never felt the same way
with the rest of them
[786.16] I’ll have to teach him so much.
[790.18] What would you have to teach me?
[793.74] Look.
[794.90] When you like someone
[796.44] or when you get to be friends
with someone
[797.99] then you have to build your
trust with them
[800.94] and have to maintain some
boundaries of privacy with them.
[804.22] And I’m afraid if you can’t do
both of these, then we don’t
[807.87] have any future together.
[813.78] Why are you laughing?
[817.21] I really like this future part.
[822.35] Did you hear anything other
than this?
[824.43] Not at all.
[827.83] Actually I trusted someone once.
[832.53] She left me during my bad times.
[835.28] I just didn’t trust at all
after that.
[837.94] Bulla all I can say is that
[841.23] Everyone isn’t the same or
alike.
[845.84] Goodnight.
[847.34] Goodnight.
[993.59] It’s nice.
[995.04] Sometimes a person should
forget everything
[998.55] And think about such things.
[1000.94] They should talk about things
which they don’t normally talk
[1002.95] about.
[1005.05] We tend to get so busy in our
lives that we never get a
[1008.10] chance to reflect on our past.
[1013.29] Bulla...
[1014.93] You’ve never talked about your
father.
[1020.05] Now that he isn’t alive anymore
so...
[1022.78] What do you think about it?
[1027.83] I don’t think at all.
[1031.33] I avoid it.
[1032.30] Why?
[1036.12] Maham..
[1038.95] Our relationship wasn’t a good
one.
[1042.71] But yes if I could just talk to
him for one last time then..
[1048.27] Things would’ve been different.
[1054.69] I always used to think that
[1057.22] Those people are really lucky
[1059.75] Who have their own loved ones.
[1066.04] How strange it is.
[1069.29] That I had everything yet
[1071.99] I wanted to go the UK.
[1074.24] By leaving everything.
[1077.02] What have you thought now?
[1080.31] Just that in order to balance
relationships
[1084.69] One needs money.
[1087.15] Look.
[1088.74] If my father had money
[1091.08] Then my relation would’ve been
a good one with him.
[1094.53] If I had money then
[1096.71] Hina wouldn’t have left me.
[1098.81] And haven’t you thought
[1101.33] That you can balance
relationships even without
[1103.72] money Mr. Inspector?
[1107.48] No
[1109.42] What?
[1110.38] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1114.00] Often regardless of having so
much money or power
[1118.14] One still tends to lose their
precious relations.
[1121.68] Do think about it.
[1123.39] Okay teacher come please
sit
-Now tell me where are you
[1125.08] taking me?
[1127.11] I’m taking you to balance
relationships.
[1131.45] First balance the bike.
[1133.55] Let me start it at least. It’s
getting me insulted.
[1140.76] See this app here?
[1141.84] By pressing this button we can
help you whenever you’ll be.
[1145.99] There’s just a little time to
go now. After that we’ll give
[1148.54] you the app after it’s developed.
[1149.95] Then you can easily reach out
to us.
[1152.36] And I’ll also tell you
something really special..
[1153.37] Sister Dawar is laying outside.
He isn’t getting up.
[1155.88] Laying down? What do you mean?
[1182.22] What happened Maham?
[1186.98] I don’t know.
[1188.05] He was unconscious so I brought
him to the hospital.
[1190.76] He’s over-dozed.
[1192.37] Over-dozed?
[1193.42] By what?
[1195.30] Drugs.
[1197.80] Ehtisham brother it’s because
of you that I’m not involving
[1199.75] the police in this.
[1201.84] But he’s in a very critical
state.
[1204.56] And according to the reports.
[1205.85] it’s a repetitive drug abuse.
[1207.93] I’m sorry.
[1216.96] This is all... My fault.
[1219.58] How is it your fault?
[1221.06] You always work for everyone’s
benefit.
[1223.72] Why are you feeling guilty?
[1226.92] This is so not your fault.
[1233.75] Dawar?
[1235.70] Son who gave the drugs to you?
[1241.21] Son don’t be afraid of us.
[1243.39] Tell us who gave the drugs to
you?
[1245.43] There is a man.
[1246.77] He gives drugs to us.
[1251.90] Dawar since when has this been
going on?
[1254.02] I don’t know.
[1258.08] Whoever he is
[1261.15] I won’t spare him.
[1263.96] Dawar where does he meet you?
Where does he give you these
[1266.37] drugs?
[1268.81] We can take Bulla’s help. We
can involve him in this Ehtisham.
[1272.14] We can catch that guy.
[1300.09] You sell drugs to kids?
[1302.93] Who’s stuff is this?
[1303.84] No sir I..
[1305.46] Who’s stuff is this?
[1307.01] I just supply it.
[1308.51] It doesn’t belong to me.
[1310.10] It belongs to Mr. Shah.
[1311.89] What?
[1313.14] It belongs to Mr. Shah.
[1319.61] Get lost.
[1323.22] Who’s Shah?
[1325.05] Bulla stop him, he’s running
away. We caught him with so
[1326.90] much difficulty.
[1328.67] Who is Shah?
[1329.57] Do you know him?
[1331.78] Bulla are you listening?
[1334.17] Do you know who Shah is?
[1336.51] Speak up!
[1337.01] Whoever he may be..
[1339.62] We don’t need to get involved
in this case.
[1344.50] He’s supply drugs to these
young kids and you’re saying
[1346.99] not to get involved in this case?
[1348.23] So what?
[1350.56] He isn’t forcing them.
[1352.22] They are doing it willingly.
[1353.99] If we get rid of Shah today,
tomorrow you’ll find another one.
[1358.30] My hands are tied.
[1364.60] Are your hands tied..
[1368.06] or joined with him?
[1371.51] Your promotion to a SHO..
[1374.94] Your elite life style?
[1380.00] Everything was happening so
quickly, that I’m so stupid I
[1383.77] couldn’t even see it.
[1385.65] Look..
[1389.26] Don’t.
[1395.79] I’ll bring Shah
[1397.60] To justice myself.
[1399.78] And for that I don’t need your
help.
[1405.54] What relation do those kids
have with you?
[1408.98] Why are you taking such a big
risk for them?
[1411.90] Is it necessary for me to have
any relation to them in order
[1413.91] for me to do something for them?
[1415.16] You don’t have any humanity
within yourself and you’re
[1417.59] expecting the same from me?
[1419.65] Which humanity Maham?
[1422.69] Which humanity?
[1425.67] There’s a bunch of every lying
and deceiving personnel in
[1427.18] every corner of the streets,
[1429.17] There’s milk being sold with
water mixed in it.
[1432.02] Even though the doctors sell
such medicines which..
[1437.07] Humanity doesn’t exist anymore
Maham. It just doesn’t exist.
[1441.16] That was because of humanity
Bulla
[1443.40] That someone chose to adopt me.
[1445.78] They taught me, fed me, because
of which I reached here today.
[1450.17] Humanity still exists.
[1452.41] It’s people like you who are
trying to kill it.
[1456.38] If you’ll respond badness with
badness then the world will be
[1458.99] destroyed.
[1462.38] So much cruelty?
[1464.13] So much injustice?
[1466.62] And you want us to do nothing
at all?
[1470.96] At least I can’t live in a
world where we can’t even help
[1474.65] anyone according to our capacity.
[1478.42] We owe this to others Bulla.
[1481.36] But I guess you won’t
understand.
[1490.22] I actually thought
[1493.80] That you’re not like this.
