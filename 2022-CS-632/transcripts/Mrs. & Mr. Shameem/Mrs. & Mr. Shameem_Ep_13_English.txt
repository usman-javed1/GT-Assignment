Don't touch me! Disgusting man! You've shown your true colors! I have been punished for your deeds. Is this why you saved me? Don't touch me! How could you do this to me? - Please listen- -
Don't. Is this your prescription? Are you sure? This is so stupid, mom. I don't want to oil my hair. Your hair is full of dandruff, and you don't want to oil your hair. You look so erratic. Have you seen yourself lately? Bad words, mom. Is erratic a bad word, baby? Straighten up. Mom, it's hurting. What's hurting? Enough of your drama. Hurting. Papa... Papa won't interfere today. He'll be quiet. Sit up straight. Umi, he said it's hurting,
leave him alone. He's only making excuses.
He's feeling nothing. Sit up straight. Mom, you've got nails like a witch. I'll slap you! - Enough!
- Witch, huh? What are you doing, Shameem? He's done for now. He said it's hurting. - He'll lose all his hair, he'll become bald.
- Let him become bald. Shameem. Hassan. Yes. Come here. Shameem sir, are you feeling okay? I'm okay. Why aren't the boys
showing up for work? No one wants to come to work. Even Kasim has joined
a different salon. Why? After what happened that day- Which day? The incident with Tony, sir. The boys are very afraid. Afraid? Tony has quit working here. His brothers won't come
back here to make a scene again. It's not about his brothers. I mean... What do you mean? Be straight with me. God knows what things
Tony has touched. Even I'm afraid of working here. - The other day he was saying-
- No, no, it's all rubbish. I wonder what rubbish
Tony said to the boys that day. Tell the boys to talk to me. Shameem sir, you are very nice. You take good care of us. But even we have a family. Can I give you a suggestion? You should close down this salon. Close down the salon? Is this a joke? As for the stuff,
I can replace everything. And if the boys think
they can blackmail me, then I can replace the entire staff. I wonder what the problem
is now that Tony is gone. But you're still here. Why do you work so hard? Why? Tea. First, you teach at school, then you spend the rest of
the day in the kitchen. And then you have
n't been keeping well. How do you know? I know everything. Where are Humaira and Wajeeha? Let them do the work. There are no free meals here. Thank you for your concern,
but I like being busy. Your tea is getting cold.  Finish it. What's wrong?
Your hands are trembling! - It's nothing.
- Are you sure? Yes. - Are you sure?
- Yes. Umi, you finish this tea, I can't. Sorry, I've got mouth ulcers. I'll have something cold. I'll give it to Bay ji. - Don't, I already tasted it.
- What's going on here? Why are you two fighting? Why can't a mother
drink from her son's cup? Leave it, Bay ji? - Why?
- I've been doing it all my life. Leave it What is this, Shameem? You didn't want it a while ago. I'll make a fresh
one for you, Bay ji. Umi isn't well, Bayji, she is tired. You know what, tell Wajeeha
to make some tea for you. - Shameem...
- Come with me. - What... -
Come on. He's finished this one too. What are you doing, Shameem? Now Bay ji will think
I made you do this. I don't care if she does.
Don't tire yourself, please. I am not tired.
Who is going to wash the dishes? No one else is going to do it. If you really care about me, then give me a hand
in washing the dishes. Umi, at least think
about your status. You're not the Umi anymore. You're a teacher. What impression will
this have on the students? They will make fun of you. You're being weird, Shameem. I wonder what's wrong with you. Since when did you
become status-conscious? Just try to understand
what I am saying. - Are you feeling alright?
- Yes, I am fine. And what is this mess? What is this? Whose medicines are these? It was next to the money box. Did you take money as well? How did... Why do you touch my things? Always going through all the closets. Why are you getting furious,
Shameem? Tell him not to touch my things! Umi was concerned about my nature, and the doctor kept pressuring
me to tell Umi the truth. Because otherwise, I was putting her life at risk. It was easier said than done. One day I decided, to tell Umi everything at any cost. Because her life was more
valuable than my reputation. Shameem, isn't this beautiful? Yes, it's nice.
It'll look nice on you. It's not for me. We'll have to gift Wajeeha
something at her wedding. I really love this. It's a little expensive
but she will love it. Okay, fine.  But I have something
important to tell you. Go ahead and tell me. Don't worry about the money. I'll pay my share.
But we must gift her this. I like it. They even have matching earrings. What are you saying? I want to talk and you're
worried about Wajeeha. What is more important
than Wajeeha's wedding? - What's the matter?
- Umaina. Umaina. Coming, Bay ji. I'll be right back. Wait. Bay ji, at least play it properly. Give it a nice beat. This is all I can do at my age, I don't have
any more strength left. - Wonderful.
- Yes, Bay ji. - Hey...
- Look, Umaina is here. - Come, join us.
- Look at what they are making me do. - Crazy people.
- Dance with me. O' Allah!  I am so tired. Bride's prepare for their wedding, like clothes, jewellery. But she's busy dancing.  You want
to dance at your own wedding, huh? Why?  Didn't Salma
dance at her wedding. - Didn't she, sister-in-law Umaina?
- Don't ask her. She's her friend.
Listen... You forced her to dance,
she didn't dance on her own. This is a limit.  Crazy girl. This isn't right. Why didn't you invite
me to your wedding? Enough, Bay ji.  Get up. Now you must get up. - Get up, Bay ji.
- No. Try to understand my legs are weak.
Crazy girl. Shammo... What did I have to discuss with him?
She has made me go crazy. Please brother Shameem, teach me that step
you did at Salma's wedding. You must dance at my wedding too. No need for a veil. Here you go. And get up sister-in-law Umaina. Please, get up.  I want you to do the
same step you did at Salma's wedding. - Come on.
- Be quiet. Come on, come on, come on. Sing along with me. Wonderful. God bless them. Look what an excellent
job he's done, Bay ji. I was specific about what I wanted. Isn't it looking nice? It's a nice color. What happened?  Why are you crying? No, son.  I am not crying. I am just overwhelmed. After such a long time,
we have a reason to celebrate. Everyone is so happy.  May God keep us away from the evil eye. God bless us all. Don't worry, Bay ji, with God's grace
everything will be fine. Umaina. Come here, child. Come here, child.  Come closer. Tell me something. Yes, Bay ji. I always said mean things to you,
but you never fought back. Never said a word. What do you call this relationship? You act like a daughter
in spite of everything? You are my mother. Thank you, child. What are you saying? What is that you say? What do you guys say? Thank you.  Thank you. No thank you. Why not? People don't know what
a big favor you've done to me. It's okay. I couldn't imagine Wajeeha would
get a proposal, and from such a nice family. Thank God. How stupid of me! How do I thank God? Leave me alone. Look, he went to sleep.
Leave me alone.  Give me a pillow. He went to sleep on my lap. I'll go pray and thank God. I can't even get up. I'll be right back. You wanted to say something. You wanted to say something. Nothing. Umi was not like regular wives. She would never insist on something
I didn't want to talk about. It would make me
feel angry and sad, that she should force
me to tell her. And get this burden off my chest. But... Then...Wajeeha's wedding... Helplessness or relief? I can hide this fact
from her for a couple more days. Take a look,
Rukhsana, take a look at the color. Look at this, Bay ji. Did you get it from the same shop? No, we looked around. They are nice.  They are lovely. I'll wear this sari
to aunt Wajeeha's wedding, won't I look cute? You want to wear a sari?
Your father will break your legs. I'll deal with him. Surprised, aren't you? I am stepping up for my daughter. I wish I had made
up my mind earlier, this father-daughter
wouldn't be torn apart. Even Fatima yearns
for her father's love. Even when she's hating him, she's pining for his love. Umaina... Did you invite your family? Invite them, dear. Call them. Weddings are the only time
when we mend broken hearts. Or death! Why should I approach them? If they don't care
whether I'm dead or alive, then why should I? It does make a difference, otherwise, you wouldn't
be so worried and concerned. You should go. Umi. Okay, stop it now. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop it. Everything will be fine. Come on. How are you? Are you okay? Come with me. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father, open your eyes. Umaina's here. [PRAYERS] Okay. You must eat. You've got pills to take after this. Have some. Done. Father didn't apologise, nor did I. We were both quite self-centred. I was shocked to see my father, and my father to see me. Once again we didn't meet
each other's expectations. When I kept meeting father, I
took care of him. I realized how helpless
a person feels burdened by his ego. Humaira, give me some money. You're always asking for money. I don't have it. Come on, I want to get a shave. See how weird it looks. There's some money in the spice jar. It's only 200 rupees. That's all I have. At least keep some money. Shameem, did you collect
father's medicines? How long? Okay, fine.  Thank you. Umaina. Yes, father. Come sit next to me. Let me plate this soup first. I don't want that thing. Come sit here next to me. I cannot muster this courage again. You don't have to say anything. No, now is the time. You have several
complaints against me. - No, father, I... -
I am still talking. When you left home, I decided never to
see your face again! Owing to your actions. Anyone else would have
reacted the same way. No. Any other father would have
stopped you from leaving. Even if he had to use force. But I saw it was better you left. It's true. Whenever your thought
crossed my mind, I would calm myself by abusing you. It's true. I was a selfish father. A very bad father. Look, don't do it, father. Forgive me, dear.  Please forgive me. Shameem. Son, how do I thank you? I couldn't take care of my daughter,
or protect her. You gave my daughter respect. Come here. Those were father's last words. I could never imagine
that my father would die. Everyone has to die one day, Umi. Promise me,
Shameem, you won't die before me. Hurry up, it's getting late. Need a facial. My sweetheart is waiting for me. Didn't you work for Shameem before? Yes. What happened? Did he fire you? I can put in a
recommendation for you. He's my brother-in-law. I know. But that's not required. Shameem sir didn't fire me, I quit. Aren't you ashamed? Trying to be a wise guy. Address madam as sir. What happened? He always admits that
his boys are very loyal. So what happened? I think the salon will close down. It was closed the other day as well. Please, don't talk
about the Salon here. My boss is watching. Why not? I am talking about the salon,
not a brothel. Don't you know? What? The incident with Tony? The junior eunuch? What's wrong with him? I'll tell you everything,
but not here. Tell me everything. "Come join in and do the dance." Oh no! "Life is so unpredictable." "You never know when
you'll breathe your last." "Life is so unpredictable." "Come join in and do the dance." Humaira... I don't have any money. You always get me wrong. As if I am a scoundrel. But not at such a time? What do you mean? Come here, before it's too late. Come here. You have to be firm to
hear what I am going to say next. You know, Shameem... Shameem! Shameem! Shammo! Shammo! Shammo! Shammo! What is Khurram saying? What rubbish is he talking about? You have AIDS? For God's sake, don't tell Bay ji about this. At least not until
Wajeeha's wedding. Finally, happiness
has knocked on our door. Bay ji and Wajeeh are elated,
don't spoil their happiness. It will ruin everything. On one end is your sister's wedding, and on the other is
your sister-in-law's doom. I wonder what else poor,
helpless, Umaina's destiny beholds. She was already an orphan,
now she will be a widow. For God's sake, don't say such negative things. Don't you dare tell Umaina anything? What do you think I am? I would have told
her first if I had to. Poor Umaina's been...
She is the one who has been deceived. But...I can't endure
this pain for too long. I think we should tell her. No. So she can make her arrangements. For God's sake,
you don't have to tell her anything. I will talk to her. I know how to break the news to her. Don't worry, I'm there. I mean we're here to look after her. We'll look after her.  Promise! Bay ji was right. Happiness never comes alone, it also brings some
kind of sad news with it. It is the result of an evil eye.
Everything is ruined. You're whining like
he's already dead, and his funeral's lying here. He's still alive.  He's with
us for a couple of more days. Damn you! You always hurt my feelings. My brother... I you. I... Humaira. Humaira, stop it. It's God's will. My wife is very emotional. Look at you. So patient, so calm. You're facing death, yet you're standing firm! Sometimes Humaira
makes no sense at all. Just yesterday she was saying why do
n't you start your own business. How long will you
be a live-in son-in-law? I know she is right. But it's not easy to
secure money for a business. And who would lend money
to a useless man like me? But this is the right
time to prove myself. I have an idea. Sit, I'll tell you. Sit over there. Sit. Why don't you start
some business for me? Me? Yes. Your salon's already closed down. They say an empty
shop and an empty mind, is a devil's workshop. And you know about me. What if I say something? Wajeeha's wedding can be ruined. And you'll be leaving us,
sooner or later. So I must be financially strong. But don't tell Humaira. And you know about me,
I don't like to talk to anyone. Women make a mountain out of a mole. When you have made the arrangements, you can whisper in my ears.  Got it?
