What's this? On your neck? Ohh...love bite. It's the stamp of love. Wow. You're not some product
that needs to be stamped. What are you saying? We love each other. It's not love, it's lust. Are you jealous? My green-eyed monster. Don't you have
anything better to do? Doesn't matter. And what do you know about love? Why? Am I not human? Don't I have a heart. Surely you're human, but... You get my point. How do I say? Let me explain to you in detail. When two lovers are
in each other's company, they have no control
over themselves or time. And a lover's touch
changes your physical form, turns everything into a fantasy. You begin to flow with each other. Pass through each other. Meaning, you're unaware of what's happening,
or what people are thinking. Everything just feels nice. Didn't understand, did you? I don't want to learn the kind of love
that starts and ends with being physical. Two people can be in a relationship,
when there's love, emotions, respect for one another. You'll be looking for respect,
and someone will rob you of it. But I guarantee you one thing, no female is ever going to love you. Promise. Listen? Are you sure? I liked to be a Love guru. I would keep talking,
and he would listen. I thought he didn't
know anything about love. I was crazy. But the aspects of love he knew were unheard of by me. I felt love. But him. He lived it. We're getting married in two days, and I came over to invite you. If you can attend the wedding, it will make Umi very happy. She will be completely ecstatic. I don't care about how she feels. Please leave. I am talking to you. I know you're angry, but- I said leave! And take this too. I accept. Congratulations. Call me if you need
any kind of help. Give me a miss call. I am awake. I don't know what to say. Even though I knew what
we're going to talk about, but I am clueless now. Umi, you don't have
to worry anymore. Now, this is your home,
your room, and... I am yours too. You're looking cute. Very cute, I swear. I knew you would look
gorgeous as a bride. And see... You like taking pictures, don't you? Come, let's take a selfie. I know what you're thinking. You must be thinking what a weird wedding this was. No wedding band, no wedding guests. What a boring wedding. The life of every party had such
a dull wedding. This is what's going
on in your mind, right? Look, I got a ring for you. - Give me your hand.
- Stay away! I feel stifled in this wedding
dress, this house, and this family. If you touch me again, I'll immolate myself and you too! - Umi-
- Go away! Leave! Bilal, please talk to me. Please talk to me. I know you are checking my messages. Why aren't you attending my calls? I'm prepared to do whatever you say. Please forgive me,
I know I was wrong. I will never get angry
with you ever again. Talk to me. Shammo, come here. What is this? I've been watching for two weeks, like some servant you've
been taking trays to her room. She doesn't step out of her room. She hasn't been keeping well. Curse her. What illness lasts this long, huh? If you want me to be your keep,
then I'm ready for that as well. Please get me out
of this hell, please. What happened? All okay? I am fine when you're not around. Try not to show your face. You don't eat properly. At least eat something
for the sake of this child. This child has made my life hell. I wish he dies- For God's sake, don't say
such things when I'm around. Why? What does he mean to you? Why are you worried about
him when his father isn't? And you think you own me now. No! You still have no right over him! I am not asserting
my right over anyone. I'm begging you. You've locked yourself
inside this room for 15-days. You don't step out at all. Go out, face the world. And you don't have to
feel embarrassed anymore. Face the world after marrying you? Don't you get it?
Everyone makes fun of me. Face the world? I would've rather
died on the streets. You should've left me there. I loathe you. Give me a holler
when you finish eating. I'll come and collect the plates. You've no shame at all. I've been humiliating you,
but you feel no shame. Don't you have any shame? Then listen to this. I was sending voice notes
to Bilal before you arrived. You should hear the last one,
for your own satisfaction. "If you want me to be your keep," "then I'm ready for that as well." "Please get me out of this hell,
please." I will do it,
and you'll do nothing but watch. You think you own me now. Take this away and
get some poison instead. I had so many dreams. I thought that room would
be mine post Salma's wedding. And I'll be finally
free of Bay ji's snoring. But it's my bad luck. You're worried about your room, but
the entire manor is at stake here. I've doubts about
Umaina's intentions. Marry a guy like Shammo. Why would a smart
girl like her marry him? Lord, only you can
protect this family. Hasn't your useless husband
been occupying this house as well? That freeloader. Everyone has complaints
about my husband. No one wants to see me settle down. Since I've no children
meaning I've no rights either. My husband and I are the only bad people
here, and everyone else is God's sheep. You never take notice of your
daughter-in-law, or her attitude! She doesn't even
talk to you straight, or even step out of her room. Humaira is right. She doesn't talk to anyone. She always stays
locked up in her room. Is this how she is
repaying your goodness? Tell your son he can't be so. What do I do? What do I do? What do you want? Strangle my son's happiness.
Tell him to divorce her. Listen... Listen, Rukhsana, what do you want? Do you want my son to treat
her wife as your husband treats you? I am the unlucky one! I ended up with a
cruel husband and an uxorious brother. I wish I too had an uxorious husband. We can see now.
We're not children anymore. Even I have children. And legal ones. Stop talking. Stop talking nonsense! Why? Why should we shut up? Thank God our husband
didn't get suspicious, or else they would've humiliated us! You guys are hiding hideous
acts harlotry and adultery. Disgusting. God forgive me. You pray with such a filthy mind? Now you know why your
prayers never get answered. I am telling all of you,
you can't see my son happy. Happy? But I don't see any happiness here? Brother's face always looks pale. I wonder what Umaina does with her. Get down. Get down and get lost. Umi. Umi. What happened? Calm down. Here. Clean with this. Umi. Come on. Come quickly. Move faster. Bay ji, she is here. - Greetings.
- Greetings. Where is your daughter-in-law? Let me tell you. If it's good news, then I'll accept
nothing less than gold bracelets. She is that way. What are you doing here, Naseeba? Bay ji. Shammo, Umaina isn't feeling well,
and I thought she might- What did you think? - Leave. Get out.
- I only came to give good news, and this is how I get treated. - Are you watching this?
- I am watching everything. Wait just a minute.
What misbehaviour is this? What misbehaviour is this, Shammo? Don't you remember, even Fatima... What are you trying
to find all the time? What is your problem? What is the matter? You wanted to marry her,
and I agreed. So what are you hiding from me?
What is it? We're not blind, Shammo. We can see everything. We don't speak up because- What do you know? What do you know? I'll tell you. She is pregnant! Are you happy now! Let's go now. Be quiet. Be quiet. For God's sake be quiet. I'm confused myself.
I don't know what to do. Pregnant? Destiny has left me completely
embarrassed, Bay ji. Prayers, venerations,
fasts, things I've done. But my prayers are never answered. He doesn't bless me with a child,
but people like Umaina... Be quiet. Be quiet.
Cry softly. Cry softly. If the men in the house find out,
they will raise a storm. Your husband will kill you!
Be quiet! Does everyone know? It doesn't matter
even if they find out. He's my child. He's not your child! Did you hear? Are you listening?
He's not your child. Why are you lying to everyone? I won't let you succeed
in your intentions. Keep it down. - Come here.
- I'll manage. Be quiet. Tilt your head. Patience! Patience! I said be patient. Turn around. Relax. You can't tolerate
little pain, Shammo, You know you are playing with fire. You'll only get burned. - Enough.
- Look at me. Can you take the heat? That's it. Remember... When you were a child, you insisted on having
a black francolin as a pet? And you locked him in a cage. She injured herself
trying to escape. You would apply
ointment all the time. You couldn't keep him for long. You cried so much.
How can you forget? You know she is just like
a black francolin. She will kill herself
in front of you, but she won't stay with you. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do, Shammo. Set her free. Let her go. Let her go, my child.
Let her go. Let go of her. Just let go of her. No, my child. No, my baby. Okay, it's okay. Enough! I just want to say, if you feel, this marriage was to restrain you,
then you're wrong. Whenever you want to leave,
you can do so. No one... will stop you. But not now. Give some time to yourself. Gather yourself. I'll take you... wherever you want.
Listen. Where are you taking me? Shameem, where are you taking me? Shameem, stop the car. Shameem... Why did you bring me here? Why? We've been here
before several times. Are you trying to embarrass me? Trying to make me feel small? What do you want? Do you want to humiliate me? I want you to cry. Yell, scream and release
all the pain in your heart. Feel unburdened again. But for God's sake,
be who you used to be!. Umaina. You look very good. Shameem. Please sit. Umaina... Look, I know you're furious with me. I want you to hit me. Please Umaina... Please hit me. I was coward. I ran away, and I am really sorry. But what else could I do? My parents said
if I don't marry Ruhi, they will disown me. What could I do in a situation
like this? You tell me. I know they are greedy,
I know they are selfish, but at the end of the day,
they are my parents. Even my parents threw me out. Where do I go now? What do I do? Umaina, I am so sorry. If I knew, I would've accepted
you in front of the world. I didn't know.
I am really sorry. - Shameem told me-
- What did Shameem tell you? What did he tell you? That your father... threw you out of the house. Didn't he tell you
about everything... else I've been through,
my struggles? Umaina, look... If I could go back in time, I would fix everything,
but I can't. But I want to fix things with you. How? I want to accept you and your child... I mean our child! I want us to live
separately in a flat. You, me and our child. We'll have a great life. And I'll keep visiting you. What do you mean
you'll keep visiting me? Won't you stay with us? Look, legally it
would be impossible, with my parents and my wife around. With time I can manage. But immediately it's
going to be difficult. Bilal, I don't get it. You're saying you
won't stay with us. How can I live with you like this? Look... You... texted me and said that you're... prepared to live with
me in any condition. You said that, didn't you? Baby, don't be like that. Umaina, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. We've had some great times together,
haven't we? Do you want to get back with Bilal? I don't know. I'll have to pay for my mistakes. I won't divorce you. No. So finally you've
shown your true colours. That's all the goodness
you could pretend to have! What? Are you threatening me? Or blackmailing me? This marriage has no value for me,
so a divorce cannot stop me. This time I won't let anyone
come between Bilal and me. And certainly not you. I won't divorce you. Not because I don't
want you to meet with Bilal. You can meet him whenever you like,
stay with him. I know this marriage disgusts you. But it's the only thing
that will protect you. Bilal will never marry you, nor accept this child. But our marriage is
a certificate for you. No one can point fingers at you. When the child starts going
to school, he'll need an identity. And I'll give him that identity. You don't need to
be scared of anyone. You can live respectfully
with your child, whether I'm a part of it or not. Tell Bilal that... you're ready. Get up. Shameem, get up. - What?
- Who are you? Are you God or an angel? What are you? What do you think? I'll be
impressed by you and start crying! No! I'll go back to Bilal,
and stoop as low as he wants me to. But I won't let you play
this game of existence with me. I am not playing any games! If you felt insulted by
anything I said, then I apologise. But my motive
is only in your interest- Why do you think about my interest?
Why? Why? Am I not burdened with
enough sins of my own, that you want to
do these favours on me? Why do you want it? Shameem, you're stooping
lower than me to save me! Shame on you! Stop abusing yourself! You can say anything you want to me. But it hurts. Why do you feel pain? I want to know.
Look at me. Look at me. You cannot lie to me! Are you in love with me? Tell me.
Tell me, Shameem. Are you in love with me? It is not your problem. Go and be happy with your Bilal! I have nothing to do with you. I don't want to be an angel or God. I want to be your friend again. Try trusting someone. I have nothing to do with you. I don't want anything. I don't know what to do. Shameem, I'm madly in love with him.
I cannot forget him. Tell me what to do? Am I doing the right thing, Shameem? His love has made me blind.
I cannot forget him. Tell me, Shameem. Tell me, Shameem.
