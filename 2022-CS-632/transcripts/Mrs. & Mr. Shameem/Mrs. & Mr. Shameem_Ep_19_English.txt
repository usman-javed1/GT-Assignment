What happened? Missing Ali? Rascal bothers me a lot too. I am scared, Shameem. We've decided to give
birth to this child, but... We made this decision together, and we'll stick to it. What if I slip into
depression again, like I did during Ali. Then that's not a problem at all. I've had enough practice during Ali, that I'm an expert now. Don't worry. Just be happy. What do you think?
Don't I want to be happy? I want to be happy, Shameem. I want to experience
everything I missed, when I was having Ali. All the joys a mother
feels when her child is born. I want to be happy. Listen Umi, life is a b*** If we have to face it, we can only do it with happiness. Someday, life will learn its lesson
and sort all things out. Now eat. We were returning back
to the ways of our life... And it felt as if years
of ice was melting away All the emotions, desires, which were buried
under that layer... were seen again. Back then, I had everything Now, all I had was Umi
and her hopes. Maybe that was enough
to hold on to life. She's driving me nuts. Wajeeha. For God's sake open the door,
Wajeeha, how long will you
keep yourself locked up? God... Look how worried Bay ji is. At least think about
your old mother. Forget Bay ji. She won't come out until
her mother isn't dead. She won't come out. Bay ji, I'm trying
to make her understand. Wajeeha... At least eat some food. Good Lord! Rascal...b*** How rude of her! This is why you're so unlucky. It's a good thing they rejected her. Curse you. Fine. Even I'm going to sit right here. I'm right here. I won't budge. Come out and I'll show you. Get lost. I said get lost. Curse all of you! Lord... Did you call me Abbasi sir? Yes. Here's your this month's salary. Salary? But... Keep it as advance. Keep it. This is too much. Abbasi sir! Don't you like a
little extra wealth? We're expecting a new member now. Keep it for his sake. Keep it. But we haven't received any booking,
Abbasi sir. You're so naive. The other day you
were saying on the phone. "My wife is pregnant." That new member will
bring good fortune. Your life is about to change. Hard work pays, son. Go. We got some fresh meat.
It's kept in freezer. Cook some spicy Balti Gosht. Okay? So that's... Thank you. I want that poster. Yes, that one. Okay, then. She scolds you? She even scolds me. She's such a bore, isn't she? She takes a while,
but understands eventually. What happened? He kicked me. You're so dramatic. Ali... do you need any help
with your homework? Okay. Mom... Are you talking to me? Mom, I'm hungry. Look at me. I'll get something. Umi. What is it? What happened? What happened? What have you done? What did you do? It wasn't my fault alone. It happened with our consent. I can't do a single thing. My pills have fallen down.
Pick it up for me. Shameem, where are you going? The pills are down here. Shameem... What are you doing? Wretch... what is this behaviour? You shouldn't use such words
in front of a pregnant woman. - I see...
- Right. The baby can hear everything, and it can have a
negative impact on him. The elders say women look
their best when they are pregnant. You're the only
one with an attitude. While the rest of the women around
the world do all their chores. Here. Here you go. Go and see, a pregnant woman
can also do the catwalk. Do you want to see it? Look. Look at me. - I am looking.
- Like this... Like this... Come on. Do your catwalk. What is this pregnant
woman cooking today? Where did you go away,
my Shammo? Why doesn't he miss his Bay ji? Come back to your mother. Come back. Even you don't talk to me anymore. No one ever talks to me anymore. Just watch... One day I will leave all of you, and never come back. Then you'll realise. You've cried enough
for this wretched man. Don't talk rubbish. Give me back my picture. Don't you dare talk
ill about my son? I will break your jaw. Why shouldn't I? He ruined all our lives
and ran away. Pathetic! Go away! Don't forget,
he loved you the most. Shameless, how can you forget? Loved me? He broke my marriage
and ran away himself. I curse him. I hope he dies. Be quiet! Be quiet! I will kill you. I will kill you if you
say another word about him. He didn't run away. He didn't leave us. I told him to go
away to save your life, so you can all settle down. My son... He left for everyone's sake.
He left so that we can live in peace. Someone call my son back. I wonder where he is.
Leave me! Go away! I don't need anyone. Madam ji, are you feeling okay? I am better now. Just a little cough. Where's your son? I didn't bring him along, he bothers me a lot.
Just like his father. He's very sweet. You're very sweet yourself, madam. May God bless you
with a very cute kid. God bless. Madam ji, if you don't mind... I bought these for you. It's very ordinary. But I bought these for your child. Wait. Madam, take a look. I'll take a look. Wait a second. I'll be right back. Shabana. Yes, madam ji. As soon as sir returns, I'll pay you for it.
I don't have money right now. No madam ji, I didn't do it for money. I bought these for your child.
It's a gift. Take a look. Such beautiful clothes. And I thought- No. It's a gift for you. They are so adorable. It's a beautiful gift, Shabana.
What more can I ask for? Thank you. In the beginning, I thought that
Abbasi sir would never trust me. But now he's also entrusted
the accounts to me. He looks like a grouch, but he's a nice guy. Where did these bangles come from? I kept them there. We didn't bring any jewellery along. Yes, it's memorabilia. Whose? Whose is it? Tony's. Your Shameem has returned, Bay ji. Shammo. Shammo. No, Bay ji, no. Why are you trying to get up? Your Shameem's right here. I won't go anywhere. I won't go anywhere. I am here now. I will stay with you. No, don't cry. your Shameem has returned to you. Why are you crying? Don't cry. Madam ji, what happened? Why are you crying? Baby shower is such
a happy occasion. Sir has made such
beautiful arrangements. Your sir has lost his mind. Does he even know
what a baby shower is? Honestly speaking madam,
even I don't know. I've only seen it in movies. Why are you crying? I just remembered someone. One misses their family
on such a joyous occasion. Even you are like our family. You two are very nice people. I will never forget
the respect you two gave me. Even my own family
never respected me. But after everything you did for me,
I can only pray, that my Lord blesses
you with a handsome child. Don't bless us with a son. I want a daughter like your madam. Bless her for a daughter. We don't need a son. What happened, Umi? Umi, are you alright? You're burning with fever. Get up. I'll take you
to the hospital. No, not the hospital. What are you saying? If not yourself,
atleast think about this child. I'll borrow Abbasi sir's car. I'll take you in his car. This is a pretty complicated case. HIV, pregnancy,
and she has pneumonia. HIV patients have this infection, especially during pregnancy. It's pretty common. Then you tell us what to do. I am giving you initial medication, but my advice to you is
to go for a C-section immediately. Caesarian? But she's only in her seventh month I know. The baby is premature. But the mother and child's
life is at risk here. And no one will handle this
case in the current situation, because even the doctor can
get infected during the delivery. Why will anyone take this risk? But I can understand your problem. My advice is to get her admitted, and then we'll see. How much will it cost? 3-4 lakhs 3-4 lakhs! Thank you. How will I arrange for the money? What am I going to do? I'll be fine.
Nothing will happen to me. Don't worry. I've Tony's bangles. Don't even think about it. I want nothing from
that wretched person. Don't even think about it. I would rather die. Don't say that. - Don't even think-
- Okay, fine. - You'll see my dead face.
- Okay. fine. Then let's do one thing.
Let's go back home. It will be the end
of all our troubles. Come on. I cannot face Ali in this condition. No, Shammo. Come back. Come back, son. I want you to come back. Come back. Come back to your Bay ji. Shammo. Enough. Bay ji. Bay ji. Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji, get up! Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji! Bay ji, get up! Bay ji, get up! Bay ji! Bay ji! Anybody there? Bay ji! Madam ji. - I don't want it.
- Just a little. Come on.
It's very important for you. Shabana. God bless you! Only a little... It's very important for you. You're right, but... Shameem, we cannot cheat anyone. And not a loving
person like Shabana. No. But look, what if she refuses? Then we won't have
many options left? Didn't you hear
what the doctor said? If anything happens to
Shabana during the delivery, then I can never forgive myself. She should know. She has a child as old as Ali. That's fine,
Umi, but if we want to live, then we must be stern. We must think about ourselves first.
We've to be selfish. I can't believe you are saying this! Yes, I am saying this. All my words. You stopped me from selling
Tony's bangles and I listened. You refused to go
back and again I agreed. But I won't listen to you this time. We don't have to
tell Shabana anything. Umi...listen to me. For my sake. Umi... You didn't bring your son along? His father took him. What do you mean? He left me and took him. He says you make a buck out here, and I'll make him beg
on the streets in the city. What a cruel man! Not cruel, he is a poor man. Madam ji, poverty is a b*** ...makes a man lose his faith in God. What will you do without your child? Madam ji, my job has gotten
a lot easier now. Don't worry. There is a saying, one less pot equals one less chore. Even if I commit suicide now, I won't miss my son. Just bear the pain a little more. - She must be coming.
- The pain is awful. I know, Umi. Umi! Where were you? Look at her condition. Don't worry, sir. - I can even give my life for madam.
- Why shouldn't I be worried? Get the blankets. Shabana I've AIDS.
Shabana I've AIDS. What have you done? Why did you do it? Who will I ask for help now? What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Umi! Don't worry, sir.
Everything will be fine. Just go get these items on the list. I am right here. Don't worry. Shabana. Shabana. Shameem. Umi. Umi Umi! Umi, just a little... Allah... Come on. Just take two steps. Take two steps. Be brave. Where will we go now, Shameem? Misfortune and adversity seems to follow us everywhere. I am tired. Why doesn't pain leave us alone? Because we try to run from it. We don't challenge or accept it. Sorrows are like a little child. It keeps running after you. You know... ...when I went to say
goodbye to Abbasi sir, he told me a story. He said once there were two women, whose children died. One of them built
a big tomb for her child, as big as the Taj Mahal. And do you know what
the other one did? What? The other one made a trust. For treating the disease... ...which killed her own son. Because she didn't want anyone else
to face the same pain and suffering, which her son had to face. What if we hadn't run away, then she would've been sleeping in
your lap and not under this bed of soil. Umi, I am tired. I am tired! Let's go back. We couldn't save our child, maybe we can save another life. Let's go! Let's go back to our Ali. Back to our family.
