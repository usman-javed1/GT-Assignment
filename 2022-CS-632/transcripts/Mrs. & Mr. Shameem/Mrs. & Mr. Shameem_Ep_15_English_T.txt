[136.40] AIDS.
[144.04] An unfortunate disease,
[149.56] which erases
[157.04] its victim's identity.
[165.24] No relative,
[168.40] or status.
[172.56] He's stuck with
a single identity.
[182.92] That he's...
[188.56] ...HIV positive.
[194.04] That's all.
[224.28] Bay ji,
why did you take the trouble?
[227.16] You should have called me.
[228.68] What's wrong?
[234.16] What are you doing, Bay ji?
[236.92] Why are you crying?
[238.92] Come, sit.  Sit here.
[256.80] - Forgive me!
- No, Bay ji.
[260.32] Don't embarrass me, Bay ji, please.
[262.72] What are you doing?
[265.88] I didn't know.
[271.40] I didn't know what
a great woman you are.
[274.04] No.
[281.32] You stood by Shameem,
[287.72] even when his mother couldn't.
[290.68] Bay ji,
after what Shameem did for me,
[293.84] I've done nothing.
[296.12] Any other wife
would have done the same.
[301.60] Wives cannot be so strong.
[305.64] Wives cannot be so strong.
[309.92] Only a companion can.
[313.00] You are his true companion.
[316.52] You are his true companion.
[321.36] I need another favor from you.
[323.32] Name it, Bay ji, anything for you.
[325.52] I beg of you
[331.44] Take Shammo and
go someplace far away.
[336.68] Go somewhere far away.
[348.36] I have already lost my son.
[352.80] My daughters...
[362.16] People here won't let you live.
[365.52] Die somewhere peacefully.
[380.84] Look...
[382.96] Look how unfortunate I am.
[386.12] Look how unfortunate I am.
[388.36] I am telling my child
[390.68] to leave this house.
[394.40] I am telling my child to leave.
[419.36] As life seemed to fade away,
[424.52] even our memories began to evade us.
[436.48] I know what you're going to tell me.
[440.44] For God's sake, it's not my fault.
[443.48] I tried to stop Khurram.
[446.68] But he's such a stubborn
and vile person,
[450.68] that he told Wajeeha's
in-laws anyway.
[454.60] I tried...
[457.36] Stop blaming yourself.
[459.88] It's not your fault.
[462.88] You're a victim yourself.
[466.20] Tolerating a person like Khurram,
[470.60] living with him requires courage.
[472.64] Uncle was unfair,
[476.16] by marrying his
useless nephew to me.
[479.56] Thinking he would mend
his ways after our marriage.
[483.20] But people like him never change.
[485.20] Come on.
[495.08] Look Humaira,
[498.04] we weren't ready...
[502.64] ...for the trial
life put us through.
[504.84] In fact, no one ever is.
[512.16] But since we're in this,
[515.00] we've got to face it now.
[522.60] We'll do something with our lives,
[529.04] but Ali is still very young.
[532.84] He doesn't understand these things.
[540.68] We must save Ali.
[546.84] And only you can help us.
[553.88] Humaira,
[556.44] you don't know how strong you are,
[559.64] and honest too.
[563.04] I've been a witness.
[565.36] I've seen it.
[569.64] And I am sure you'll not just
fulfill yours but the responsibility... ...which
[576.16] we're going to give you.
[588.84] Will you support your brother?
[594.56] Will you be Ali's mother?
[631.40] Oh!  It was this way,
that you gave your own, your
[635.68] very own child to someone else.
[643.56] It wasn't an easy decision to make.
[648.96] Handing over the apple of our eye...
[656.80] ...to someone else isn't easy.
[661.44] And only parents can feel this pain.
[666.80] Mrs.  Shameem, people often leave
their children in garbage dumps,
[673.72] to save their reputation
or starvation.
[676.28] Or if they are slightly
merciful and don't kill them, they
[680.68] leave them at some orphanage.
[685.68] Even they are parents.
[689.20] Are there ways out like this?
[696.96] Mrs.  Shameem,
is fear an eminent emotion,
[701.52] which can overpower
even a mother's love?
[721.32] Maybe you've heard,
[727.56] some random person who can't swim,
[734.60] jumped into the ocean... ...
[741.08] to save his child.
[743.92] You must have.
[750.20] What do you think?
[754.16] Why do you think he did it?
[758.92] Because he wants to carry
this medal of honor with pride?
[768.00] Or...
[771.48] ...with the fear... ...
[776.44] that his child will drown.
[792.08] Wherever we would go
we would only face rejection.
[798.48] Ali was not a bad student.
[801.28] His last year's performance
was pretty good.
[805.24] But he was tagged along with us.
[812.68] AIDS.
[817.36] - Leave me.
- Ali.
[818.52] - Leave me alone, I don't want to go.
- Ali.
[820.40] - Just listen to me.
- I don't want to go.
[823.80] Why don't you want to go?
[825.36] You will have to go.
[826.72] Whether you like it
or not you'll have to go.
[828.88] - Understood.
- Stop it.
[830.28] - Papa, please.
- Come here.
[832.24] Come here.
Listen to me.
[839.28] Look...
[841.12] even mom and dad don't
want you to leave us.
[844.60] Even we are sad.
[848.28] But the schools here are dirty,
[852.92] very bad.
[855.68] We're sending you
to a better school.
[858.80] Because you have AIDS.
[860.84] Everyone's right.
You are the worst parents.
[864.32] What are you doing?
[867.04] What are you doing?
[869.00] Please, dad,
I don't want to stay away from you.
[876.48] Stop it, son, stop crying.
[881.52] Everything will be fine.
[886.40] Thank you very much, madam.
[888.32] We're indebted to you.
[890.16] Very cute boy.
[892.16] Tell me your name.
[893.48] AIDS kid!
[904.52] What was that, Ali?
[907.72] - I want to know what that was?
- I don't want to talk to you.
[915.36] My son, please don't do this.
[918.92] You know how much
pain mom and dad are in?
[922.32] If you send me away again,
[924.20] then I'll do it again.
[928.28] Fine,
[930.04] will it be fine if
mom and dad are dead?
[933.60] Shameem!  Shameem!
[936.32] Shameem!
[937.88] What's wrong with you?
[939.08] Shameem!
[940.56] Call someone, son.
Shameem!
[978.32] Oh Lord please,
[982.04] have mercy.
[991.48] Will papa be fine?
[995.56] Yes, dad will be fine.
[998.92] He will be fine when
you wake up in the morning.
[1002.68] He'll be home.
[1005.28] He'll be fine.
[1024.48] Papa, I will do as you say.
[1038.08] What?
[1039.16] Take your medicine.
[1045.68] It wasn't right to
emotionally blackmail Ali.
[1055.36] Do you think I enjoyed
emotionally blackmailing him?
[1061.00] It was painful for me too.
[1065.60] AIDS was quickly
devouring us inside.
[1071.40] The signs were everywhere.
[1081.36] Inside as well as outside.
[1101.32] We realized that it doesn't
matter where Ali is,
[1109.00] as long as he's connected to us... ...no
[1114.64] one will accept us.
[1119.64] Except for one person...
[1193.44] What are you doing?
[1196.20] It's important.
[1198.80] Who is it, sweetheart?
[1202.60] It's someone I know.
[1204.92] Stay inside, don't move.
[1210.24] Come this way.
[1211.32] Your brother is
crazy and so are you.
[1214.44] I have nothing to do with you two.
[1217.60] Listen to me, Khurram,
[1219.84] I want to adopt Ali
with legal documents.
[1225.00] And I can't do it without you.
[1227.16] I don't care who you adopt,
[1229.80] keep me away from this mess.
[1231.52] Go away.
[1232.52] Stop disturbing me.
[1233.64] I spent a fortune on the hotel and...
[1235.84] Leave.
[1237.96] I am doing this for you.
[1240.96] For me?
[1243.52] Are you adopting him or me?
[1246.80] Mother Teresa.
[1249.16] Go inside and close the door.
I'm coming.
[1255.00] Listen to me carefully.
[1257.20] You sold brother Shameem's shop,
[1260.28] and now you're sitting idle.
[1262.52] You never thought that Shameem
has the biggest share in the manor,
[1266.40] then we sisters.
[1269.16] If we adopt their only son,
[1273.04] then who gets the lion's share.
[1276.80] Think.
[1279.08] I can't pull this off without you.
[1283.48] Oh my my.
[1286.04] I never paid attention to this.
[1289.00] Humaira, you've become pretty clever.
[1293.28] I never expected such a clever
idea from a stupid person like you.
[1300.64] Humaira,
[1302.44] you know I love you always.
[1307.48] I know you can do
anything to have me back.
[1317.44] I did this out of spite against you.
[1326.12] Come on, let's go home.
[1329.32] Come on.
[1330.72] Come on.
[1332.60] Let me carry that.
[1334.20] Come on.
[1337.68] Adoption papers are ready.
[1339.68] Please read it properly and sign it.
[1343.24] Here and you sign here.
[1390.08] I'll talk to him
[1391.40] Sorry, Excuse me!
[1401.48] You siblings are so filmy.
[1404.40] The drag kind.
[1406.68] Such a bore.
[1422.72] Shameem.
[1425.44] I can't do it.
[1429.12] For Ali's sake.
[1431.68] We must do it for Ali's sake.
[1434.32] Please.
[1437.28] Come on.
[1478.84] Congratulations Humaira begum,
[1480.20] now you're officially
master Ali's mother.
[1571.16] - Oh!
- Oh no!
[1584.92] Thank you.
[1588.32] Bring your hand out.
[1590.36] No, Umi will do it.  You leave it.
[1595.60] - Let her spend time with Ali.
- Leave it.
[1598.16] I said Umi...
[1600.24] Six!
[1601.40] Take it back.
[1603.32] Please!  Please!  Please!  Now...
[1605.36] Oh shoot,
I should have placed it behind.
[1608.16] Come on.
[1628.36] Wash your hands.
[1636.88] It's done.
[1638.16] Every child has some
complaint with his parents.
[1641.56] Some more, others less.
[1644.12] But everyone does.
[1646.44] Ali does too?
[1648.32] He may have too.
[1651.48] It's not easy for the
child to understand...
[1654.64] ...their parent's decision
and their behavior.
[1662.24] My father couldn't
express his emotions.
[1666.20] He was a man.
[1668.40] How could he show his weaknesses?
[1672.84] Whereas it was his biggest weakness.
[1677.84] I always had this
one complaint with him.
[1684.16] And now,
[1687.48] he gave me his love along
with regret before he died.
[1695.56] Now I wish I could've spent...
[1699.48] ...some more time with him.
[1704.28] You forgave him,
[1707.00] even after everything he did to you?
[1715.52] You did him a big favor.
[1722.80] I did myself a favor.
[1726.60] I was carrying a
huge burden on my heart.
[1731.48] Finally, I set myself free.
[1734.84] And when he realized his mistake,
[1736.52] there was nothing to
stop me from doing the same.
[1740.12] My father is not like that.
[1743.16] He will never realize.
[1747.80] Fatima.
[1751.56] Parents are a big blessing.
[1755.20] Ask those who have none.
[1761.32] Don't be angry with
them for too long.
[1765.84] They haven't been around for too long.
[1769.48] And it's very painful...
[1772.68] ...when they're not around.
[1776.16] Do a favor not on them,
but yourself.
[1778.88] Forgive brother Abdullah.
[1783.84] He will never realize.
[1787.08] You can try.
[1794.08] Why take the trouble?
[1796.96] I could've come over.
[1799.48] You took the consignment
back without saying a word.
[1803.32] When I checked the
consignment again,
[1805.24] I noticed faults in it.
[1806.88] I said not to worry,
I'll keep these.
[1809.32] I'll send you a fresh stock.
[1812.68] Brother Abdullah,
you are a very honest man.
[1817.48] I am very impressed.
[1819.96] You were amazing.
[1823.32] What did I do?  Any honest
person would act the same way.
[1829.08] You're buying back the
stock at the original price.
[1833.84] You are at a loss
by making me a profit.
[1837.80] You're not an ordinary person,
Abdullah.
[1841.60] You are very special.
[1843.68] Maybe, but a lot
of people don't agree.
[1848.36] Who are you talking about?
[1850.84] No one.
[1851.68] What were you saying?
[1856.24] Brother Abdullah,
there is something I want to say.
[1858.92] Go on.
[1860.04] You said you have a daughter.
[1864.60] I want to come to your house.
[1870.44] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1872.36] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1874.92] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1877.92] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1880.40] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1883.28] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1886.48] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1889.44] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1893.32] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1896.60] Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them!
[1909.16] Ali...
[1911.16] say it, child.
[1913.56] You'll call her mama
and not Humaira aunty.
[1918.00] Why?
[1926.24] Because if you don't call her mom
then they won't allow you in school.
[1931.32] But she's my aunt and not my mom.
[1933.88] I am telling you.
[1936.68] Why don't you understand?
[1939.40] You won't call her Humaira aunty,
[1941.48] you'll call her mom.
[1942.64] Understood.
[1961.84] Ali...
[1966.80] Ali...
[1967.88] Yes, mom.
[1972.28] Son, you didn't answer her question.
[1976.32] She's asking you something.
[1979.44] Doesn't matter.
Children often become nervous.
[1983.04] It's okay.
[1985.84] Did you fill out the quiz?
[1988.24] Show me, son.
[2002.20] Your son is very intelligent.
[2004.40] Bravo.
[2006.12] But he has missed half of his term,
[2009.96] but let me consider.
[2013.04] Will he get admission?
[2015.04] Yes, don't worry.
[2017.92] Thank you very much.
[2025.28] Now this.
[2026.52] First right then left.
[2030.12] Look at me.
[2031.04] Look at you.
[2034.56] Come on.
We're getting late for school.
[2053.96] No parent would want to
stay away from their children.
[2061.96] She doesn't enjoy making you suffer.
[2067.04] She does it to annoy you.
[2072.64] Because when you're not around...
[2075.24] ...she prays as well as seeks repentance.
[2077.80] I don't know where
I went wrong in life.
[2082.12] I was never dishonest with my work.
[2084.52] Then why me?
[2087.32] I always respected you,
and this family.
[2090.56] Respect?
[2093.08] If you wanted respect, then
you should've given respect first.
[2096.92] You only taught her to fear you.  I
[2099.92] don't love you.
[2103.32] Your love, your affection...
[2107.28] Doesn't a daughter deserve her
father's affection?
[2111.28] I've always seen that
daughters have to kneel.
[2116.16] I've tasted the consequences.
[2119.28] What did I get except
for embarrassment?
[2122.52] You're responsible
for everything she does.
[2127.80] What do you think I like
seeing her in this condition?
[2132.00] Watching her punish
herself like this?
[2134.04] If you want to do her any good,
[2135.96] then do as I say.
[2138.48] She thinks I'm a monster,
[2141.96] but she will listen to you.
[2143.96] Tell her to get married.
[2145.64] I don't care if she
never acknowledges us again.
[2148.92] Get married and settle down.
[2156.92] I'll talk to her.
[2167.00] Brother Abdullah, do you want tea?
[2169.20] No.
[2173.48] Brother Abdullah,
[2177.32] I want to give you something,
for safekeeping.
[2182.32] I know that...
[2186.04] ...you don't like me,
[2188.96] but I know you're an honest person.
[2192.68] I won't be a part
of any of your sins.
[2194.84] You know that, right?
[2196.08] No, it's not what you think.
[2201.32] I came to give you the
papers to the manor and shops.
[2211.12] Before I go I want to
give you this responsibility.
[2221.24] And finally, the day arrived,
[2228.64] when after handing over
our responsibilities...
[2236.68] ...we wanted to erase our existence.
[2242.08] Like...
[2246.16] ...we never existed.
[2304.16] We're leaving, Bay ji.
[2378.24] Who is it?
[2380.32] It's me, mom.
[2386.48] What happened, Ali?
[2387.52] I am scared.
[2403.48] What happened?
[2404.96] Can I sleep here, mom?
[2410.84] Go to sleep with mom.
[2413.28] I want to sleep with you.
[2416.56] Please, mom, please, dad.
[2424.84] We decided we won't
meet Ali when we leave.
[2428.24] We'll get emotional.
[2431.64] Shameem, look at me.
[2443.28] Come.
[2446.68] Stay with dad.
