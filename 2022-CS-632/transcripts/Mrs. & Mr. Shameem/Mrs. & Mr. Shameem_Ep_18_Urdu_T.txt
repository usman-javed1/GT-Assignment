[106.64] Why isn't anyone answering the phone?
[108.84] Who is it?
[112.88] Wait.
[116.12] Hello.
[118.52] Hello.
[121.24] Who is it?
[123.60] Why don't you speak?
[128.20] Look, I am already quite troubled.
[132.80] Who...
[133.64] Shammo.
[136.04] Hello.
[137.72] Hello.
[148.36] Who was it?
[154.36] Shammo.
[156.24] Must be Shammo.
[158.48] I know it.
[160.56] What have I done?
[165.32] God, what have I done?
[168.72] Why did I...
[170.84] Why did you go away?
[172.32] Come back Shammo.
[176.92] Come back Shammo.
For God's sake come back.
[187.32] Bay ji.
[190.56] Oh, God.
[193.76] You...
[194.96] Come here.
[197.44] My son.
[198.44] Shammo.
[202.52] where were you?
[205.72] Where were you? Where were you?
[210.08] My son.
[213.52] Did someone...
[215.00] ...say something to you?
[215.96] Where were you?
[218.56] Come here.
[220.48] Come here.
[222.04] Come sit here. Come sit here.
[224.40] Come, my son.
[225.96] Come sit here.
[228.08] No one will dare to say anything to you.
[230.00] No one will.
[235.12] Shammo.
[297.84] This shouldn't have happened,
Shameem.
[318.88] Humaira.
[321.08] Humaira.
[326.08] The one you're crying
for is back dear.
[330.36] Get up and give him a hug.
[331.92] Get up, dear. Come on.
[333.92] How will I face him, Bay ji?
[339.36] His parents entrusted him to me,
[343.80] and I couldn't take care of him.
[346.76] No, dear. Don't say that.
[350.40] Don't say that.
[351.16] You took such good care of him.
[353.44] Get up, dear. Come on.
[356.40] He's waiting outside for you.
[359.04] Come on, let's go.
[360.84] I can't fill in his mother's shoe.
[370.04] Keep him away from me, Bay ji.
[372.40] No, no, no.
[373.48] - I can never be a good mother.
- No, no, no. Don't say that.
[379.04] Don't say that.
[380.80] Listen to me.
[384.24] You don't listen to me.
[391.72] A mother is just a mother.
[394.44] She's neither good nor bad.
[399.80] Very naughty.
[408.64] You called.
[410.84] Listen, son.
[412.44] Make the same meat dish
you made for me the other day.
[416.72] Okay.
[417.92] Do you know why?
[418.84] My family's visiting me.
[420.72] And my wife hasn't been talking to me,
[423.00] ever since she came here.
[425.32] So before she makes me spend a fortune,
[428.24] cook that delicious
meat dish again.
[431.96] Okay.
[433.04] Listen, why are you in a bad mood?
[436.40] I hope you too haven't
fought with your wife.
[440.60] Don't worry. I know.
[444.76] The best way to keep a wife busy
is by making her take care of the kids.
[447.52] They keep them so occupied
that they can't think of anything else.
[452.32] Wait a minute, I'm getting a call.
[457.76] Send five kilos of meat.
[462.16] What can I say, madam,
[464.84] my in-laws have been
literally torturing me.
[470.20] On the other hand is my husband,
[472.60] who can't take me to the city.
[475.48] He says I've no money
to buy a house in the city.
[480.80] Will I let you stay with my friends?
[483.00] Imagine, madam.
[485.40] But I've made a decision, madam.
[487.60] I'll tell you.
[489.68] This time I've made up my mind.
[494.08] Once he returns from the city...
[498.24] Seems like I'm talking
to myself, madam.
[500.96] Madam, where are you lost?
[505.60] Did you tell, sir?
[508.52] He'll be very happy.
[516.68] What will we do now, Shameem?
[522.92] What can I say?
[526.56] I don't understand.
[529.92] It's not my fault.
[535.56] I'm not blaming you.
[538.68] You haven't said a
word since you found out.
[545.56] I am not silent...
[548.56] ...just worried.
[557.20] This is nothing like
we had planned.
[564.68] It's terrible, isn't it?
[570.44] I don't know what I
should be feeling right now
[576.72] I don't know.
[577.92] Sometimes I want to be sad,
[582.40] or worried,
[586.92] or elated.
[588.52] Elated?
[591.52] How can you be happy?
[594.00] And in the current situation?
[603.84] I know.
[610.56] Do you know, Umi,
[613.36] everyone made fun of me.
[616.80] They said you can
never become a father.
[624.56] And honestly speaking
I began to realise,
[628.84] that I can never become a father.
[632.60] Bay ji would've been so happy.
[645.72] Shameem.
[650.24] I think we've been
unfair with Ali.
[662.56] Ali.
[664.40] Ali, wait.
[666.24] Eat your food, Ali.
[679.08] Ali.
[685.72] Son, eat your food.
[697.68] Fine.
[700.44] I'm sitting right here.
[704.92] The floor's so dirty,
[706.88] my clothes are completely soiled.
[709.92] And I am also starving.
[712.80] But doesn't matter.
[715.52] I won't eat until you don't eat.
[719.84] I am right here.
[767.88] What do I tell,
madam, they beat me up!
[771.68] Was it your husband?
[773.16] No, he hasn't returned
for a long time now.
[777.12] It was my in-laws.
They are cruel people.
[783.08] They snatch my money
and also beat me up.
[788.44] They are very cruel people.
[790.60] Why don't you tell your husband?
[792.12] I do. I've told him several times.
[796.84] He says why can't you be patient.
[802.00] How much more patient
can I be, madam?
[807.32] How much more?
[809.88] Being a married woman,
[812.96] I'm living like a widow.
[816.64] I cannot be patient anymore.
[819.04] I cannot.
[820.84] Be quiet. Stop crying.
[822.96] Or else I will kill you.
[825.08] Be quiet.
[827.48] Be quiet or else I will beat you.
[829.92] - I will kill you.
- Shabana. What are you doing?
[832.08] - I will kill you.
- What are you doing?
[833.76] - Leave me, madam.
- Have you lost your mind?
[837.52] He's the root of all problems.
[839.12] He's the root of all problems.
[840.56] - I will kill you.
- Don't touch him. Stay back.
[842.80] - I will kill you.
- Shabana. Stay back.
[846.92] Lord.
[849.88] You don't let me live or die.
[853.84] You are so cruel, Lord.
[856.40] Why do make us so helpless, Lord?
[861.88] Why do you bless poor
people with children?
[910.52] Hello.
[911.88] Hello, is this HIV
positive helpline.
[919.68] Welcome to HIV and AIDS helpline.
[924.08] I...am a HIV patient
and so is my wife.
[929.52] We needed information.
[931.20] Please ask.
[932.36] What would you like to know?
[935.84] We'll help you in any way we can.
[939.80] Actually, my wife is pregnant...
[965.08] Umi, Abbasi sir is a strange man.
[969.32] He was weirdly staring at me.
[971.68] But I know he will fire me.
[976.48] But you don't have to worry.
[980.00] God will help me find a job just
like he helped me find this one.
[988.60] By the way, I've all
the information on the child.
[994.76] They say if it's a HIV pregnancy
[1000.20] We're not giving
birth to this child.
[1005.56] We've already ruined one life.
[1009.12] I don't have the
strength to ruin another.
[1011.68] - But Umi-
- I'll get an abortion.
[1016.64] I haven't said
anything we don't want.
[1019.80] I just said it first.
[1022.32] Eat your food.
[1032.12] If I knew you'll be such
an uncouth when you grow up,
[1035.12] I would've strangled
you in the cradle.
[1038.00] Stop it.
[1039.32] Nothing is lost yet, father.
[1041.32] Strangle me.
[1043.08] It's for you to decide.
[1045.36] I've lived my life.
[1047.76] But no more, shameless!
[1050.68] See...look at her foul language.
[1052.40] She is talking rubbish!
She accuses me!
[1056.12] Stop it!
[1058.48] You two have ruined my life.
[1063.32] I told you,
[1065.00] I will support you if he's wrong.
[1068.48] But he's right.
[1071.48] I've personally met their family.
[1073.32] They are very nice people.
[1074.84] Must be like him.
[1076.12] Far better than me.
[1078.32] Let's forget the past.
[1080.96] It cannot be fixed.
[1082.92] Make your own destiny
and leave for good.
[1085.64] You don't have to see
our wretched faces again.
[1088.76] Leave.
[1092.56] Fine.
[1096.36] What do you mean fine?
[1099.00] Call them over. You've my approval.
[1105.96] What?
[1109.52] But how?
[1111.04] Congratulations. She's ready.
[1114.08] Stop worrying over how.
[1117.76] Maybe God gave her some sense.
[1121.12] I hope.
[1124.12] Congratulations, sister-in-law,
[1126.84] my son likes your daughter.
[1132.16] Congratulations to you too.
[1133.76] Even we like your family a lot.
[1137.32] Being from such an affluent family,
[1138.72] you people are so decent and humble.
[1141.84] Otherwise,
we've no comparison at all.
[1144.20] Let's not talk about any comparison.
[1148.48] Brother Abdullah's honesty and integrity
are unmatched in the entire market.
[1155.80] That's what brought
me to your threshold.
[1161.16] And as for Fatima is concerned,
[1165.16] I am sure she must be
religious just like her father.
[1169.08] What more can we ask for?
[1170.92] I am not like my father.
[1176.12] I am honest like him.
[1178.60] Fatima...
[1180.12] No, let her speak.
Go on, dear.
[1185.96] My father has never done a bad deal.
[1189.80] He never gave any bad
product to a customer.
[1193.00] Of course.
[1194.08] And I am witness to this, child.
[1196.88] Shouldn't he show the same responsibility
when it comes to relationships?
[1204.76] Ask him is he being dishonest
with you about his daughter?
[1210.96] Is he betraying you?
[1212.84] Fatima.
[1216.36] Tell him, father.
[1218.92] Tell him about my flaws.
[1222.60] And be honest.
[1224.16] Fatima!
[1231.60] My daughter is right.
[1233.88] If I am honest in
every aspect of life,
[1236.84] then I must be honest
about my daughter too.
[1243.92] My daughter has flaws, Sheikh sir.
[1249.80] She's been raped.
[1253.12] Not once but several times.
[1258.96] And I am to be blamed for it.
[1264.16] She always said I don't
want to go back, father.
[1269.56] They are not good people.
[1273.20] But I would take her back anyway.
[1277.40] I used to feel that she's the devil.
[1282.32] I was arrogant about myself,
[1286.80] that I'm one of God's
most liked people.
[1289.88] God always listens to me.
[1293.68] And often my word was God's will.
[1303.48] I didn't know that
it would be my fault.
[1309.32] I am my daughter's culprit.
[1314.00] No one else,
[1315.84] not even God.
[1320.00] Only me.
[1323.56] My decisions did
this to my daughter!
[1336.48] Forgive me, child!
[1339.52] Forgive me!
[1345.16] Forgive me!
[1366.44] I came to apologise
to you Abbasi sir.
[1372.16] but please don't fire me.
[1375.00] I need this job.
[1386.00] I had a cousin.
[1388.88] My aunt's son.
[1391.24] He was my best friend, my buddy.
[1396.40] When many locals started
moving out for better prospects,
[1400.48] he said he'll do the same.
[1403.60] "I'll make a lot of money there,"
[1406.68] "then we'll both build
a huge hotel in"
[1413.00] He wanted to make a lot of money.
[1416.12] Big car, big house.
[1421.76] He came back.
[1424.80] He came back.
[1427.60] But not with money,
[1434.32] with this AIDS.
[1438.48] But Abbasi sir, I did no such thing.
[1441.48] Hear me out first.
[1445.44] These cruel people didn't
let me bury him here.
[1452.20] He was my best friend.
[1457.84] I couldn't do anything for him.
[1461.32] I was scared.
[1464.56] I regretted it later.
[1469.36] Listen.
[1470.88] You're a great guy.
[1473.60] Don't tell anyone or
they will throw you out.
[1482.60] I can understand your helplessness,
Abbasi sir.
[1485.72] Don't worry, we'll leave.
[1488.04] Hear me out first, you fool.
[1492.16] I couldn't do anything for him.
[1496.68] I was scared.
[1499.16] I regretted it later.
[1502.08] But I will do for you.
[1505.24] It'll help me clear my conscious.
[1510.80] And my friend might forgive me.
[1514.12] Don't tell anyone about this
[1520.72] Thank you very much.
[1524.16] Whatever life I've left
I'll be indebted to you.
[1530.72] Thank you?
[1532.08] If you want to repay the debt then,
[1534.08] don't forget this Abbasi.
[1536.52] Pray for me.
[1544.08] Go. Leave.
[1546.56] Go now. I don't want you to see me cry.
[1548.92] Leave.
[1554.08] Okay.
[1573.48] But why, madam?
[1574.96] Will you help me or not?
[1577.76] Good Lord, spare me.
[1580.48] - Shabana.
- Good Lord, spare me.
[1582.04] - I've no one except for you.
- This is a sin, madam. It's a sin.
[1585.80] God wants to bring
him into this world,
[1587.92] - how can I take away his life?
- You were trying to kill your own child.
[1590.60] It was only in a fit of rage.
[1591.80] Imagine I am in a fit of rage too.
[1593.08] Please help me.
[1594.88] Don't be stubborn, madam.
[1596.52] Years later you'll
be blessed with a child,
[1598.76] you'll be blessed with God's grace.
[1600.36] If it's anything sir said,
[1601.76] then I'll explain to him.
[1603.76] Why don't you understand that
we cannot give birth to this child?
[1606.68] That's what I am asking,
madam, what is the problem?
[1610.40] Problem!
[1611.20] The problem is that
I am going to die!
[1636.64] Umi.
[1638.08] Umi, have you lost your mind?
[1640.72] You make it sound like you've
known her for several years.
[1642.68] She said she's a midwife.
She has handled many cases.
[1645.88] And you believed her.
[1647.00] You haven't seen anyone
help in childbirth yourself.
[1650.12] Do we have any other option?
[1652.36] No, we can go to the hospital.
[1654.48] Have you lost your mind?
[1656.84] We both know this is illegal.
[1660.16] Someone will help us out.
[1663.52] If not out of sympathy
then at least for money.
[1666.16] And then what?
[1667.48] They will conduct tests
on me and find out I've AIDS.
[1670.40] Does anyone accept this disease?
[1672.80] We don't have many options.
[1697.76] Madam,
[1700.20] think about it again.
[1703.36] It's a risk to your life.
[1710.32] Come early in the morning.
[1712.12] I'll be ready.
[1728.12] Hey.
[1730.92] Why did you throw it away?
It's so cute.
[1733.92] I don't want it.
[1738.40] It's fine, if you don't want it.
[1740.32] But that doesn't make it useless.
[1743.40] It's so cute.
[1769.36] Listen...
[1773.08] You think your parents
gave you to me,
[1775.60] because they think you're useless.
[1781.44] I am the useless one,
[1783.56] everyone would discard me.
[1786.72] That makes us even.
[1793.80] Can I ask you a question?
[1796.32] You felt bad that your
father gave you to me.
[1801.68] But the truth is,
[1804.24] he actually entrusted me to you.
[1809.08] So what now?
Won't you take care of me?
[1813.12] Will you discard me as well?
[1824.16] Well...
[1826.92] can I go?
[1833.80] And take him too?
[1840.64] Okay.
[1902.48] Umi.
[1906.84] What if something happens to you?
[1910.36] Then I won't have any complaints.
[1914.20] It's a good thing.
[1917.08] I don't want to see you die.
[1923.16] How unfair?
[1925.44] You didn't think about me.
[1928.80] I did...
[1930.80] But like you always say
that Umi you're very selfish.
[1936.96] I am.
[1939.08] It's a good thing if I die first.
[1941.92] I don't want to wallow
in the pain of your separation.
[2006.08] Sir, please listen to me.
[2011.32] No more discussions.
[2013.80] Shameem, go outside.
[2017.52] I said go outside!
[2019.44] Go outside!
[2065.24] They say that a mother's womb
is the safest place for a child.
[2073.84] But my womb gave
birth to only bad luck.
[2082.32] First Ali and now him.
[2089.72] He would be born with AIDS.
[2093.40] Endure sickness and people's
rejection for the rest of his life.
[2099.12] From those who we ran away from.
[2103.32] But Mrs. Shameem you've
always explained to Mr. Shameem,
[2108.40] that parents can do
anything for their children.
[2112.36] But they can't be their God.
[2117.36] But after hearing your
statement it sounds like,
[2123.76] You've decided
that child's destiny as his god.
[2127.76] Before life could've rejected him,
[2133.12] his own parents rejected him.
[2137.92] Like Ali.
[2142.48] Wait!
[2144.44] Wait!
[2145.60] Go away.
We don't want to do anything.
[2147.64] What are you doing?
[2149.08] - Umi, there is no need for this.
- She won't leave.
[2151.12] Shameem, I said go.
[2152.52] I'll lose my courage.
I have convinced myself...
[2154.68] - ...with great difficulty.
- Go away.
[2157.12] - You should go.
- Listen.
[2161.16] - Don't do it.
- Everything will be fine. You have me.
[2163.60] I'll lose my courage, Shameem.
[2166.52] This is wrong.
[2168.32] I said go!
[2281.16] Umi,
[2284.04] I know you're angry with me.
[2285.68] But what we're doing is wrong.
[2289.96] I don't want any lectures.
[2292.92] I know why you did it?
[2296.84] Why?
[2299.68] He's your child.
[2302.48] Your child.
[2305.32] Otherwise, you would've felt
the same pain while leaving Ali.
[2310.68] The truth is you never
accepted Ali as your child.
[2314.04] It was just a favour you did to him.
[2320.36] Favour?
[2323.52] You think I did a favour on Ali.
[2327.16] You mean I don't love Ali.
Don't love him as my son.
[2331.32] You left him in the garbage.
[2334.32] All these years I
showered my love on him.
[2336.40] - You're a great man and I am a wretch.
- Please.
[2339.48] Once again you saved
a life from this monster.
[2342.04] Shut up.
[2343.92] You don't know what you're saying.
[2346.00] I will say it.
I'll scream to the top of my voice.
[2348.80] You should've stuck
to the decision we made.
[2351.52] And if you loved him so much,
[2352.96] then you should've
stayed away from that Tony.
[2354.88] He's disappeared himself
and made our lives hell.
[2357.40] I am thinking ill for my own child today.
[2364.04] You're saying this out
of disappointment, aren't you?
[2366.52] What's left except for
disappointment and despair?
[2369.96] Getting pregnant in
these conditions is a sign.
[2374.12] What sign?
[2375.76] We may be disappointed with life,
[2378.96] but life isn't disappointed with us.
[2382.68] Look, we've cried
and suffered our share.
[2386.60] Look at the brighter side of life.
[2389.12] I wonder what else
life wants from us.
[2395.52] Listen to me.
[2398.48] Listen to me.
[2401.20] Everything will be fine.
