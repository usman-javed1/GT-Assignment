[136.32] What happened? Missing Ali?
[144.36] Rascal bothers me a lot too.
[147.92] I am scared, Shameem.
[151.64] We've decided to give
birth to this child,
[155.04] but...
[164.36] We made this decision together,
[166.36] and we'll stick to it.
[168.36] What if I slip into
depression again,
[170.08] like I did during Ali.
[171.68] Then that's not a problem at all.
[174.04] I've had enough practice during Ali,
[176.00] that I'm an expert now.
[178.84] Don't worry.
[180.48] Just be happy.
[182.44] What do you think?
Don't I want to be happy?
[185.28] I want to be happy, Shameem.
[187.64] I want to experience
everything I missed,
[189.36] when I was having Ali.
[191.64] All the joys a mother
feels when her child is born.
[196.08] I want to be happy.
[201.88] Listen Umi, life is a b***
[205.80] If we have to face it,
[208.68] we can only do it with happiness.
[211.72] Someday, life will learn its lesson
and sort all things out.
[217.88] Now eat.
[222.32] We were returning back
to the ways of our life...
[226.64] And it felt as if years
of ice was melting away
[233.88] All the emotions,
[236.32] desires, which were buried
under that layer...
[243.60] were seen again.
[248.08] Back then, I had everything
[252.96] Now, all I had was Umi
and her hopes.
[259.56] Maybe that was enough
to hold on to life.
[267.76] She's driving me nuts.
[270.64] Wajeeha.
[271.96] For God's sake open the door,
Wajeeha,
[273.80] how long will you
keep yourself locked up?
[276.84] God...
[277.80] Look how worried Bay ji is.
[279.92] At least think about
your old mother.
[281.48] Forget Bay ji.
[283.84] She won't come out until
her mother isn't dead.
[286.00] She won't come out.
[288.92] Bay ji, I'm trying
to make her understand.
[292.60] Wajeeha...
[293.88] At least eat some food.
[298.84] Good Lord!
[300.64] Rascal...b***
[303.72] How rude of her!
[306.40] This is why you're so unlucky.
[309.52] It's a good thing they rejected her.
[312.16] Curse you.
[313.00] Fine.
[313.92] Even I'm going to sit right here.
[315.92] I'm right here.
[317.32] I won't budge.
[318.72] Come out and I'll show you.
[320.72] Get lost.
[322.44] I said get lost.
[327.44] Curse all of you!
[331.64] Lord...
[344.08] Did you call me Abbasi sir?
[346.36] Yes.
[348.60] Here's your this month's salary.
[352.16] Salary? But...
[353.80] Keep it as advance.
[355.92] Keep it.
[364.76] This is too much. Abbasi sir!
[368.56] Don't you like a
little extra wealth?
[370.88] We're expecting a new member now.
[372.80] Keep it for his sake.
[374.44] Keep it.
[379.68] But we haven't received any booking,
Abbasi sir.
[383.48] You're so naive.
[386.60] The other day you
were saying on the phone.
[389.64] "My wife is pregnant."
[393.72] That new member will
bring good fortune.
[397.64] Your life is about to change.
[400.64] Hard work pays, son.
[401.92] Go.
[402.56] We got some fresh meat.
It's kept in freezer.
[405.88] Cook some spicy Balti Gosht. Okay?
[409.00] So that's...
[411.96] Thank you.
[428.16] I want that poster.
[434.04] Yes, that one.
[461.96] Okay, then.
[464.96] She scolds you?
[466.64] She even scolds me.
[469.64] She's such a bore, isn't she?
[475.04] She takes a while,
but understands eventually.
[479.88] What happened?
[480.76] He kicked me.
[482.56] You're so dramatic.
[496.00] Ali...
[498.04] do you need any help
with your homework?
[504.40] Okay.
[508.20] Mom...
[521.88] Are you talking to me?
[523.68] Mom, I'm hungry.
[545.16] Look at me.
[553.36] I'll get something.
[575.84] Umi.
[577.44] What is it?
[579.32] What happened?
[580.68] What happened?
[582.32] What have you done?
[583.92] What did you do?
[588.84] It wasn't my fault alone.
[590.44] It happened with our consent.
[594.16] I can't do a single thing.
[595.48] My pills have fallen down.
Pick it up for me.
[605.48] Shameem, where are you going?
[606.64] The pills are down here.
[608.64] Shameem...
[611.20] What are you doing?
[619.20] Wretch...
[621.28] what is this behaviour?
[622.96] You shouldn't use such words
in front of a pregnant woman.
[625.64] - I see...
- Right.
[626.92] The baby can hear everything,
[628.84] and it can have a
negative impact on him.
[630.64] The elders say women look
their best when they are pregnant.
[637.68] You're the only
one with an attitude.
[639.64] While the rest of the women around
the world do all their chores.
[643.40] Here.
[648.28] Here you go.
[649.72] Go and see,
[651.08] a pregnant woman
can also do the catwalk.
[654.16] Do you want to see it?
[655.32] Look.
[656.36] Look at me.
[657.08] - I am looking.
- Like this...
[658.64] Like this...
[665.40] Come on. Do your catwalk.
[681.24] What is this pregnant
woman cooking today?
[690.80] Where did you go away,
my Shammo?
[697.16] Why doesn't he miss his Bay ji?
[710.08] Come back to your mother. Come back.
[718.00] Even you don't talk to me anymore.
[720.48] No one ever talks to me anymore.
[724.84] Just watch...
[727.24] One day I will leave all of you,
[731.64] and never come back.
[735.20] Then you'll realise.
[736.88] You've cried enough
for this wretched man.
[738.92] Don't talk rubbish.
[741.40] Give me back my picture.
[743.52] Don't you dare talk
ill about my son?
[745.88] I will break your jaw.
[749.00] Why shouldn't I?
[750.60] He ruined all our lives
and ran away. Pathetic!
[755.04] Go away! Don't forget,
he loved you the most.
[761.40] Shameless, how can you forget?
[764.64] Loved me?
[765.72] He broke my marriage
and ran away himself.
[767.72] I curse him.
[768.80] I hope he dies.
[770.00] Be quiet! Be quiet!
[771.72] I will kill you.
[773.40] I will kill you if you
say another word about him.
[778.36] He didn't run away.
[781.64] He didn't leave us.
[786.96] I told him to go
away to save your life,
[791.24] so you can all settle down.
[799.48] My son...
[804.08] He left for everyone's sake.
He left so that we can live in peace.
[812.64] Someone call my son back.
[817.40] I wonder where he is.
Leave me!
[822.28] Go away! I don't need anyone.
[834.80] Madam ji, are you feeling okay?
[839.24] I am better now.
[841.24] Just a little cough.
[843.88] Where's your son?
[845.28] I didn't bring him along,
[847.32] he bothers me a lot.
Just like his father.
[851.20] He's very sweet.
[853.20] You're very sweet yourself, madam.
[855.92] May God bless you
with a very cute kid.
[859.60] God bless.
[863.36] Madam ji, if you don't mind...
[868.92] I bought these for you.
[870.64] It's very ordinary.
[873.28] But I bought these for your child.
[877.84] Wait.
[879.32] Madam, take a look.
[880.68] I'll take a look. Wait a second.
[883.68] I'll be right back.
[903.36] Shabana.
[904.56] Yes, madam ji.
[905.44] As soon as sir returns,
[907.08] I'll pay you for it.
I don't have money right now.
[909.64] No madam ji, I didn't do it for money.
[913.36] I bought these for your child.
It's a gift.
[920.16] Take a look. Such beautiful clothes.
[923.40] And I thought-
[925.04] No.
[926.28] It's a gift for you.
[930.44] They are so adorable.
[932.56] It's a beautiful gift, Shabana.
What more can I ask for?
[936.36] Thank you.
[970.24] In the beginning, I thought that
Abbasi sir would never trust me.
[973.92] But now he's also entrusted
the accounts to me.
[978.20] He looks like a grouch,
[981.24] but he's a nice guy.
[985.08] Where did these bangles come from?
[991.72] I kept them there.
[993.72] We didn't bring any jewellery along.
[997.44] Yes, it's memorabilia.
[1000.08] Whose?
[1003.24] Whose is it?
[1007.40] Tony's.
[1043.96] Your Shameem has returned, Bay ji.
[1060.52] Shammo.
[1064.48] Shammo.
[1065.68] No, Bay ji, no.
[1069.64] Why are you trying to get up?
[1071.64] Your Shameem's right here.
[1074.72] I won't go anywhere.
[1076.76] I won't go anywhere.
[1079.72] I am here now.
[1082.68] I will stay with you.
[1086.28] No, don't cry.
[1089.88] your Shameem has returned to you.
[1094.80] Why are you crying?
[1097.88] Don't cry.
[1116.76] Madam ji, what happened?
[1119.24] Why are you crying?
[1121.00] Baby shower is such
a happy occasion.
[1123.56] Sir has made such
beautiful arrangements.
[1126.68] Your sir has lost his mind.
[1129.60] Does he even know
what a baby shower is?
[1132.04] Honestly speaking madam,
even I don't know.
[1135.56] I've only seen it in movies.
[1140.76] Why are you crying?
[1143.20] I just remembered someone.
[1145.16] One misses their family
on such a joyous occasion.
[1148.96] Even you are like our family.
[1155.48] You two are very nice people.
[1160.64] I will never forget
the respect you two gave me.
[1165.24] Even my own family
never respected me.
[1170.40] But after everything you did for me,
I can only pray,
[1176.92] that my Lord blesses
you with a handsome child.
[1181.84] Don't bless us with a son.
[1183.20] I want a daughter like your madam.
[1185.44] Bless her for a daughter.
[1187.20] We don't need a son.
[1223.92] What happened, Umi?
[1227.16] Umi, are you alright?
[1229.80] You're burning with fever.
[1232.48] Get up. I'll take you
to the hospital.
[1234.32] No, not the hospital.
[1236.92] What are you saying?
[1239.00] If not yourself,
atleast think about this child.
[1242.36] I'll borrow Abbasi sir's car.
[1245.72] I'll take you in his car.
[1270.96] This is a pretty complicated case.
[1274.32] HIV, pregnancy,
and she has pneumonia.
[1278.68] HIV patients have this infection,
[1281.32] especially during pregnancy.
[1282.72] It's pretty common.
[1285.92] Then you tell us what to do.
[1289.44] I am giving you initial medication,
[1291.92] but my advice to you is
to go for a C-section immediately.
[1300.00] Caesarian?
[1302.08] But she's only in her seventh month
[1304.68] I know. The baby is premature.
[1308.00] But the mother and child's
life is at risk here.
[1312.44] And no one will handle this
case in the current situation,
[1316.52] because even the doctor can
get infected during the delivery.
[1320.40] Why will anyone take this risk?
[1323.24] But I can understand your problem.
[1326.00] My advice is to get her admitted,
[1329.52] and then we'll see.
[1333.68] How much will it cost?
[1336.16] 3-4 lakhs
[1343.00] 3-4 lakhs!
[1347.80] Thank you.
[1362.44] How will I arrange for the money?
[1365.96] What am I going to do?
[1369.32] I'll be fine.
Nothing will happen to me.
[1372.56] Don't worry.
[1379.16] I've Tony's bangles.
[1380.80] Don't even think about it.
[1383.24] I want nothing from
that wretched person.
[1387.16] Don't even think about it.
[1389.68] I would rather die.
[1392.28] Don't say that.
[1394.32] - Don't even think-
- Okay, fine.
[1396.04] - You'll see my dead face.
- Okay. fine.
[1405.52] Then let's do one thing.
Let's go back home.
[1410.76] It will be the end
of all our troubles.
[1413.80] Come on.
[1415.76] I cannot face Ali in this condition.
[1419.76] No, Shammo.
[1429.60] Come back.
[1435.96] Come back, son.
[1439.48] I want you to come back.
[1445.04] Come back.
[1450.64] Come back to your Bay ji.
[1455.92] Shammo.
[1458.92] Enough.
[1470.20] Bay ji.
[1473.68] Bay ji.
[1475.80] Bay ji!
[1479.00] Bay ji!
[1480.20] Bay ji!
[1481.68] Bay ji!
[1483.48] Bay ji, get up!
[1486.24] Bay ji!
[1487.56] Bay ji!
[1488.52] Bay ji!
[1489.60] Bay ji!
[1490.32] Bay ji!
[1491.24] Bay ji, get up!
[1492.36] Bay ji, get up!
[1494.40] Bay ji!
[1495.52] Bay ji!
[1497.76] Anybody there?
[1499.36] Bay ji!
[1510.76] Madam ji.
[1512.48] - I don't want it.
- Just a little.
[1514.80] Come on.
It's very important for you.
[1518.36] Shabana.
[1519.64] God bless you!
[1523.16] Only a little...
[1524.64] It's very important for you.
[1528.60] You're right, but...
[1530.20] Shameem, we cannot cheat anyone.
[1534.04] And not a loving
person like Shabana.
[1536.96] No.
[1538.64] But look, what if she refuses?
[1542.80] Then we won't have
many options left?
[1544.64] Didn't you hear
what the doctor said?
[1547.32] If anything happens to
Shabana during the delivery,
[1549.36] then I can never forgive myself.
[1551.68] She should know.
[1553.96] She has a child as old as Ali.
[1559.20] That's fine,
Umi, but if we want to live,
[1563.80] then we must be stern.
[1567.32] We must think about ourselves first.
We've to be selfish.
[1571.32] I can't believe you are saying this!
[1574.32] Yes, I am saying this.
[1576.48] All my words.
[1580.08] You stopped me from selling
Tony's bangles and I listened.
[1583.56] You refused to go
back and again I agreed.
[1589.56] But I won't listen to you this time.
[1592.88] We don't have to
tell Shabana anything.
[1596.48] Umi...listen to me. For my sake.
[1604.00] Umi...
[1607.76] You didn't bring your son along?
[1611.16] His father took him.
[1613.64] What do you mean?
[1615.80] He left me and took him.
[1619.44] He says you make a buck out here,
[1621.64] and I'll make him beg
on the streets in the city.
[1626.36] What a cruel man!
[1628.76] Not cruel, he is a poor man.
[1633.00] Madam ji, poverty is a b***
[1637.28] ...makes a man lose his faith in God.
[1643.36] What will you do without your child?
[1645.16] Madam ji, my job has gotten
a lot easier now. Don't worry.
[1649.36] There is a saying,
[1650.72] one less pot equals one less chore.
[1656.80] Even if I commit suicide now,
[1659.28] I won't miss my son.
[1684.84] Just bear the pain a little more.
[1688.92] - She must be coming.
- The pain is awful.
[1690.64] I know, Umi.
[1692.64] Umi!
[1693.52] Where were you?
[1695.52] Look at her condition.
[1696.68] Don't worry, sir.
[1698.92] - I can even give my life for madam.
- Why shouldn't I be worried?
[1701.40] Get the blankets.
[1702.52] Shabana I've AIDS.
Shabana I've AIDS.
[1713.80] What have you done?
[1715.64] Why did you do it?
[1719.80] Who will I ask for help now?
[1723.96] What do I do?
[1726.44] What do I do?
[1728.88] What do I do?
[1733.64] Umi!
[1736.20] Don't worry, sir.
Everything will be fine.
[1739.84] Just go get these items on the list.
[1744.04] I am right here. Don't worry.
[1773.64] Shabana.
[1775.72] Shabana. Shameem.
[1820.28] Umi.
[1822.36] Umi
[1823.92] Umi!
[1855.64] Umi, just a little...
[1873.56] Allah...
[1875.44] Come on.
[1876.64] Just take two steps.
[1877.64] Take two steps. Be brave.
[1986.68] Where will we go now, Shameem?
[1992.92] Misfortune and adversity
[1998.00] seems to follow us everywhere.
[2003.64] I am tired.
[2008.48] Why doesn't pain leave us alone?
[2020.64] Because we try to run from it.
[2023.80] We don't challenge or accept it.
[2032.88] Sorrows are like a little child.
[2038.48] It keeps running after you.
[2046.56] You know...
[2050.56] ...when I went to say
goodbye to Abbasi sir,
[2054.68] he told me a story.
[2062.52] He said once there were two women,
[2065.16] whose children died.
[2070.00] One of them built
a big tomb for her child,
[2075.32] as big as the Taj Mahal.
[2077.32] And do you know what
the other one did?
[2081.64] What?
[2085.56] The other one made a trust.
[2091.88] For treating the disease...
[2096.84] ...which killed her own son.
[2103.40] Because she didn't want anyone else
to face the same pain and suffering,
[2108.36] which her son had to face.
[2123.72] What if we hadn't run away,
[2136.92] then she would've been sleeping in
your lap and not under this bed of soil.
[2146.84] Umi,
[2150.36] I am tired.
[2153.84] I am tired!
[2157.56] Let's go back.
[2161.04] We couldn't save our child,
[2167.40] maybe we can save another life.
[2173.60] Let's go!
[2176.84] Let's go back to our Ali.
[2180.16] Back to our family.
