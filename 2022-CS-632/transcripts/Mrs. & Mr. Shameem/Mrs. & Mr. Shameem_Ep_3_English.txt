Bay ji. Yes?  Oh wonderful, Umaina's here. You forgot all about us after Salma left. Never showed us your face again. This isn't right. Bay ji, Umaina's having her vacation. She was going home. I said to her, why go home so soon? Stay with us for a couple of days. And I dragged her here with me.  It doesn't matter if you dragged
her here, son. Let her stay with us for a couple of days. It's okay. Go to your room.  Get some rest. I told you. Go on. Yes, go on. She can manage I controlled myself in front of you,
understood. You know how
your sister's husband will react. He will want our heads. Why did you bring her here? Is she in some kind of trouble? No, no trouble at all, Bay ji.
Don't worry. - Look Shammo...
- Bay ji. What misbehavior is this? It's you, Umaina.  I thought it was Humaira. Why would Humaira be here? That's right.  Why would she be here? Who wants to go sleep
in their own room right now? I'll sleep here instead.  Come on. Keep your hands to yourself,
or I'll chop them off! This isn't fair. Am I not your type? I know everything about you. Hell won't break loose
if you sleep with me tonight... Shut up! Leave quietly,
or else I'll raise a commotion! Okay, fine.  I'm leaving. This is my home,
and you can't lay a finger on me here. You think if you complain to Bay ji, she will chuck me out of the house! She won't destroy her daughter's
life for the likes of you! I only came over to give you sympathy. But you don't want my sympathy. You deserve that eunuch.  He's fit for you. Tell Bay ji to throw her out of the house. She is already hitting on me. Have you lost your mind? What are you doing? - Let go.
- No. Leave it!  Leave it, you dog! - Leave it!
- Have you lost your mind? Let me die! Leave it! I won't! At least let me die! Give it back.  Please. Drink some water. Shameem, what have I done to myself? I have lost my worth. Don't worry.  I will deal with him. How many will you deal with? How many more times
will you get beaten up? Let me go. Let me go. No, where will you go? Hmm? I'll do anything. I'll become a [ __ ] if I have to, but I won't be a burden on anyone. No! Can I suggest something if you don't mind? Go ahead and say it. Abuse me if you like. I won't mind anything anymore. Nothing. Ask. What is it?
Go ahead.  Ask. Will you marry me? What's wrong?
Why is everyone looking so stunned? What did I say? I've decided to marry Umi. What's so funny? It's not a joke.  I am pretty serious. "It's not a joke. I'm pretty serious!" I think she has far better choices. You tell him, brother. Did we come here to listen to this joke, leaving our important work? Come on, we've got better things to do. Disgusting. - You're impossible.
- Wait, Rukshana... Let's go.  The joke's over. Choti.  Choti. What? I know you haven't eaten
anything since morning. So I thought I'll
get you something to eat. And we can eat together. Come on, eat. Come on. And yes, I've spoken with the family. What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing with me? The rest of you. Everyone's made a spectacle of me. Did someone say something? Yes.  I've been insulted. - Who?
- You've insulted me! I insulted you? Yes.  What else will you call it? Bilal's turned me into a pile of trash! My father threw me out of the house, thinking I'm a piece of trash!
And now you... Umi! Stay away! - I don't know... -
I told Bilal you're unmanly. I told my father you're unmanly. You're his punishment.  A punishment! If you felt offended... - I was just...
- I was what? Who do you think you are? Have you ever seen yourself in the mirror? You can't even stand straight. And you want to marry Umaina. Umaina may be helpless, but not helpless enough to marry you! You Shameem... What a joke! - I did it for your sake... -
I'm leaving. Leave me! Don't touch me! Look, for my sake... You don't have to marry
me if you don't want to, - Leave me.
- I'll tell everyone. But take pity on your
condition for God's sake. Don't do this. I am feeling dizzy, leave me. Umi. Umi. Go away! I will kill myself!  Leave! Umi? So you want to marry Umaina. Have you ever seen yourself in the mirror? Always flailing like a flag. To qualify for marriage, you need to pop a rod, which you haven't got. Let's imagine... Let's imagine Umaina agrees to marry you. Then she must have
a real solid reason for it. Maybe she's in some kind of a mess. Or a ruse. Don't do it.  You'll be embarrassed. As per my experience, women like her need a man! Solid! Not your case. Listen to me and don't do it. Otherwise,
you'll come running to me for advice, The rest is your choice. Come, let's take a few puffs. That's all you are capable of. Come that way. Bay ji's room is on this side. She raises quite a commotion
if her room fills up with smoke. Come on. Bay ji, please do
something about this girl. Something isn't right. Umaina isn't wandering from
pillar to post without a reason. Listen to me and save
your son from this girl. God bless him. Call Salma. Okay. Salma, you know everything. He isn't listening to me.
Help me out here. Talk to brother Aamir. Bilal is his childhood friend. He will definitely listen to him. Forget about Bilal permanently.
For your own sake. You're saying this. Forget him? That's it. And everything will be back to normal. What all do you want me to forget? My past?  My memories? Or my future? Umi, what have you done? You tell me what do I do? What's done is done, but now I'm scared for myself. Scared?  You? Yes.  Everyone knows we're best friends. What will they think if they find out? And Aamir... I cannot afford this humiliation. I cannot put my marriage
at stake for you, Umi. - Salma?
- Salma what? Did you ask before doing this? And now you've sought
refuge in my own home. What am I going to tell Bay ji?
Why are you here? I didn't want to come. - Shameem brought me here.
- Shameem... Shameem is naive. He's doing favors because
he's decent and kind-hearted. How long can he keep you here? Go back. Get an abortion. It's too late now. Not possible now. Apologize to your family. Everything will be fine. I won't tell anyone about your pregnancy. I'll tell them that you had a
fight with your parents. Just leave. You've grown very
mature after the wedding. You'll die.  What are you doing? - Leave me.
- I can't let you die. - Leave me.
- Come on! Leave me, you disgusting man! Come on, Umi. I'm disgusting and
everyone else is decent. Kisses and hugs for everyone but not me. Isn't this unfair? What will you get from Shammo? Squat!  Which he hasn't got either? If it's something you
want then ask a real man! I will kill you. Stay back, you dog. I will kill you!
Stay back! Stay back! - Have you lost your mind?
- Stay back! Have you lost your mind? This is for your own good. Stop hitting me. You deserve this. Everyone's had their share of fun, and now it's my turn. I was saying... What are you staring at? She was going to commit suicide! She claims she will die
if she doesn't marry Shammo. This would have led to a police case. I've just saved the family's honor. And you're staring at me! And I've warned you before not to
follow me around like a spying cat. I'll divorce you if I get angry. It won't take me a minute. Stop.  Stop.  Stop. Who are you? - Leave my bag.
- Let go. - Leave my bag.
- Let go. Anybody there? Leave my bag.  My money's in it. Let go. Let's go.  Let's go. Umi. Umi. Umi. Bay ji... Bay ji, where is Umi? She must be somewhere around. Umi. Umi. Don't make a commotion.
You'll wake everyone up. Did you see her leave, Bay ji? Let her go if she's gone. Leave her alone. How can I let her go? I can't let her go. - Umi.
- Wait, son. - Shammo, don't...
- Umi. Oh God! What's wrong? Who did this to you? Everyone. They all did. Except for you. Why are you so good to me? What do you want from me? What do you want? Enough, Umi.  Enough! Enough. Enough. Nice. I am totally floored, sweetheart. Check for yourself.  How are you looking? Although there's a long
queue of beauties waiting outside, you can give them a run for their money,
sweetheart. Come on. Wonderful.  Wait. I didn't lend you my face so
you could put it on display for the world. Only for you to practice your makeup. Hurry up.  Mom's got several
chores lined up for me. God, beauty with attitude.  I can't control myself, sweetheart. Look at his attitude. Check the liner. Doesn't it look nice? How many times have I said
eyeshadow has to be applied first. And you call this eyeliner? - Looks good.
- Leave it. What happened? You should take up
wrestling or bullfighting, these feminine jobs don't suit you. Do manly jobs suit you, Chammiya? - Do you?
- What's wrong? Here's a question,
and I want an honest answer. Do you have desires? Tell me. What desire? Those desires. Do you feel anything? Yes, I do.  Are we not humans? Swear on me? - Tell me.
- I swear. So what do you do? That's strange. Tell me what you do. Move. Tell me what you do. Come on, tell me what you do? What is there to do? Whoever inspires that feeling in me, I don't take my eyes off her. Amazing.
You stole the show. So who inspires that feeling inside you? Tell me who? Don't hide from me. You! You inspire feelings inside me. Come here, baby.  Come on. But I am not a lesbian.
You've no luck with me. I'll find a macho man like Bilal for you. Leave me. - I'm sure you're all smiling inside.
- Have you lost your mind? Oh my my. What a guy! Came straight from heaven. Angels live in heaven, not jinns. Why are you jealous of my prince charming? Go find someone for yourself at the gym. You'll find someone. I don't want to. Jealous... There is a woman inside you. I was wondering, there's a book called Men are
from Mars and Women are from Venus. So what planet are you guys from? What do you mean by 'you guys'? You know what I mean. We 're from right here. This land. We're the true inhibitors of this planet. These layers of manliness
which you guys wear, we don't need it. We are what we are. Bravo. Bravo. What a speech Mother India! Bravo . You sound like Julie, advocating for men. But Julie, you don't have biceps like him. I'm floored on his biceps. Come on. Leave me. Shameem ! What happened? All okay? Huh? I'm taking her to the doctor's Bay ji. Careful . " I am doomed, the end is here." Are you watching this spectacle,
brother-in-law? They are enjoying their life. Don't you see someone older standing here? Get up, show some manners. Go make some tea for me as well. Shammo , we've to go today evening. Remember. Go where? You don't remember a
thing since she arrived. It's Friday night, remember. We go  to the shrine every Friday night. Okay, fine. Listen , can we take Umi along too?
She isn't well. - Hmm? -
Okay. Rukshana Rukshana What took you so long? I was looking for a clean one. Is this washed? It still stinks! Maybe it wasn't washed properly. I'll get you another one. Get my prayer mat.  It doesn't matter how hard
you scrub on the surface. The dirt is on the inside. Unless the heart is cleansed,
nothing will ever be right. Can I get you a clean towel,
brother Abdullah? Clean your own filth first.
Don't worry about me. This house didn't lack freaks, that you brought one more. Brother Abdullah! You can say whatever you want to me. But you have no right to talk about Umi. Why? Why can't I talk about her? No decent woman stays
for so long in another's home. That iniquitous woman... Brother Abdullah! Hey! Look, he is glaring at me. You know his nature. - How can you... -
Why is he saying such things about Umi? Umi.  Umi.  Umi. You're worried about Umi, and not your family. Look....there are people
here to look after you. But she's got only me. What are you two blabbering about? Are you calling me names? Are you calling me names? I was only telling
him to apologize to you. Apologize. Come on. Come on, apologies. Sorry. What's wrong? He won't mend his ways that easily. Today he dared to glare at me,
because of that [ __ ]. Who knows,
tomorrow he might even strangle me. We cannot accept such iniquitous
and evil deeds here, Mr.  Shameem. My daughter often comes here.
This is not accepted. Understood. This is not accepted.  Hey there ! I want you to throw her
out of this house, Bay ji! Okay, son.  Why are you getting furious? Umaina will leave eventually. Don't ruin your health over her.
Sit down. Sir, we need to get rid of
the root cause of the problem. I'm telling you.  Throw her out! Okay, fine.  Let's do that. Shammo... Your mother is begging you. Have mercy on me. She had left.  Why did you bring her back? It's just our family now. When the entire neighborhood
starts making a commotion, then what are you going to say? Where do I take her?  Where will she go? Let her go to hell for all I care! I cannot ruin my family for her sake! Try to understand. Even she has some reasons.
How can I not help her? And anyway, she is not a guest here. This is my house. Fine, then you can keep her. You can keep her too. I'll divorce your sister if you like. - Should I?
- No. - Should I?
- No. I'll divorce your sister if you like. Fine, do it! What? Divorce her.  Right now. Shameem. What are you saying, Shammo? What are you saying?
Are you in your senses? See Rukshana, your brother
doesn't want you to settle down. Great. First, you threaten to divorce her,
and now you sympathize with her. Why are you telling her? Divorce her. Divorce her right now. Why don't you? I won't divorce her! You can't force me. What can you do?  Tell me. I only respect you because
you're my brother-in-law. Quiet. Otherwise,
I won't let you stay here for a minute. And stop torturing her! She hasn't harmed anyone! Umi won't go anywhere.
She will stay right here. And yes, I am marrying her. You can do whatever you want. I am so unlucky. I got a ruthless husband, but even my own family turned against me. Brother Abdullah didn't divorce
Rukhsana because of their child. I don't even have any children. Now you decide, Bay ji. Do you value your
daughters more or your son? And also decide, Bay ji, either he can leave with her,
or we'll leave. I still find it funny
that Shameem's getting married- Shut up! What is your problem, huh? If my son likes someone
then what's your problem? What? Bay ji? What are you saying, Bay ji? Why can't I say so? Am I not a mother?  I'm his mother too. Don't I want to see
my son get married too? To see him decked out as a groom. Recently I had lost all hope. If Shammo likes someone,
what is your problem? Even we have some dreams for him. He's our brother too. But he's marrying that b**** - She has...
- Enough! Shameless, these words don't suit you! Even we saw your husband's
respectable family. We had ensured he is
from a good background. But what did he turn out to be? He is good for nothing. How did we benefit, huh? How did his prayers help, huh?
What did we gain? She's quick at pointing fingers at others. Shameless And you? Humaira, you? Your prayers are never answered, because of your husband. He's a lowlife. And this little panda. Sit up.  Come on. Shameless, little runt. How much does he care about you? "Bay ji, don't scold her,
don't yell at her." "Don't hurt her."
But you... You were laughing at him, you twit. Aren't you all ashamed? I will stand by my son. Me... I'll see who stops me. He'll marry anyone he wants. God willing, I will personally arrange his wedding. Bay ji, I don't want any of this. - I am ashamed of...
- Quiet.
