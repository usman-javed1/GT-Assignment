You think I feel no discomfort. I feel no pain. I want to forget everything, but you don't let me. You wanted me, then come and get me. Stop it. Look Shameem,
I don't want any connection with my past. Let me move forward. With him around, I can never move forward. Forget him. Stop it. I won't ask you about him anymore. I won't. Sleep. Sleep. I won't ask anymore. Yes? Who is it? You? Who is she? She's a friend's wife. - They are having some problems-
- But what is she doing here, Bilal? I'll talk to her. You go inside. - But-
- I said go inside! Go inside! What are you doing here?
Come with me. Have you lost your mind? I've a reputation in this neighbourhood. Why did you come here? Why did you come here? Are you crazy? I've come to return what's yours. Here's your child.
I cannot take care of it. Umaina... What happened to your pride now? You slammed the door on
my face and left with Shameem! So what now? What's wrong? Are you scared? Couldn't keep the child for even two days! Why should he raise your child? He's your child, you raise him. Did I tell you to give birth to him?
Did I? You had this inclination!
You take care of it! Keep me away from this filth! This is your filth, you keep it. And do what? Do whatever you please Throw it away, kill it, do whatever you please with it He's a part of you, so keep him. Quiet! I get your plan now. I get it now. You're trying to blackmail now. You're trying to ruin my family
because you couldn't settle down yourself. Shameless, characterless woman! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want money? How much money do you want? I'll f*** throw it on your face! I'm ashamed to love a man like you. I am embarrassed. I've already committed
the sin of giving birth to him, but his blood won't be on my hands. Keep him. Umaina, where are you going? Umaina, take him along.
What will I do with him? Umaina... Damn it. I'll leave it out here. I'll leave it... What do I do? I am leaving it out here. How can you do this? How can you do this? Kill me. I don't want to live. Do it properly. Right here. Kill me. Kill me! You can treat yourself
in any way you like. But he's my child. He's not your child! I've returned him to
the filth he belonged to. Your hatred has made you
a completely different person. Even a demon doesn't
treat his children this way. I am neither human nor a demon. I am a dead body. You're living with a dead body,
and I wonder why. Don't I stink, like a rotten dead body? And my child had to be like me. Lifeless... Imagine a dead body
gave birth to its death. Don't you dare utter such words for him? Hatred has polluted your heart. But his father is still alive. I will bring him back to this house. Are you listening? I will bring him back to this house. Leave him alone. He's dead. It wasn't easy for me to leave him. Shameem! Who is it? You... Where is Ali? Where is Ali? - Shameem-
-Tell me where is Ali. I swear on Umi, I will break your head... Tell me, where is Ali? No, Shameem, don't... I left him at the EDHI Centre. Bay ji. Bay ji, Shameem is back! Shammo. Humaira, don't touch him. What are you doing? I've to feed him. Mind your own business. My baby... Calm down. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Yes. Coming. Are you hungry? Milk will be ready in a couple of minutes. Ali.. Ali.. Ali? Ali.. Ali.. Umi... Ali.. Ali.. Ali.. Ali., he isn't getting up. He isn't speaking. Ali... Ali... Stop eating for God's sake! Ali.. Ali... Ali... Ali.. I've never seen such negligence before. Have you seen his condition? He's in a terrible state. If you were in some western country, you two would be facing legal charges. Is she not feeding him? She is unwell. Mr. Shameem, I've repeatedly said, this child needs mother's milk. He cannot digest anything else. His immune system
will completely collapse. He cannot survive like this. Tell me what I should do. I'm prepared to do anything you say. Bring his mother over, and I'll speak to her personally. No medicine, no treatment will work, if she doesn't feed him her milk. Ali repeatedly kept getting sick. He had to be taken
to the hospital regularly. Glucose or something else... He had to be given various drips. But he didn't need any of it. He needed the nectar
from his mother's bosom, which God gave him a right to. Umi... Umi... For God's sake,
please put an end to his suffering, and yours too. Feed him. Umi! How can you be so merciless? Don't you feel any pity for this child? Get lost. Come, my child. Come, my child. Come on. Evolution. Phylogenesis. I read somewhere that
nature doesn't endure mistakes. It devours the weak on its own. In the battle of survival of the fittest, it never sides with the weak. There was a similar war of
survival ensuing between my son and me. I wanted to erase this
mistake from existence. Hey... Hey... I wanted to get rid of him, as the last memory of Bilal. But he wasn't ready to release
me from my guilt at any cost. Sale on kids' stuff. It's a steal...
Grab them before they are gone. Children will be happy. Buy them now. Sale. Sale. Only 30 rupees, sister. Don't think, sister, buy it now. It's a steal... Only 30 rupees. Sale. Sale. Sale. Sale. Only 30 rupees Wait sister, take something for your kids. Only 30 rupees, sister. No. Just take it,
sister, your children will be happy. Sale. Sale. Only 30 rupees. Only 30 rupees. Only 30 rupees. Only 30 rupees. Go for it, brother. It's a steal deal. They're very cheap. You won't find them... Excuse me? Half a kilo of onions, a quarter
of ginger and two kilos of tomatoes. Okay. And a handful of coriander leaves. Three kilos of potatoes, along with two kilos
of cucumber and onions. Haven't cleared your past dues yet, and now you're back for more credit. Get lost. Here's your godforsaken money! You just wait. Here you go.
And don't talk nonsense to me. I must admit you've been
living it up these days. Gold chain. If you set eyes on my chain again,
I'll gouge your eyes out! Keep your vegetables. There are better places around here. Take your vegetables. See sister,
even maids have a lifestyle these days. But I know better. Their job is cleaning
but spread filth instead. Humaira. Humaira. I've been hollering for half an hour. Where the hell were you? I was at the market. It's become your favourite place recently. At the market. You feel bored at home. Was it the market you went to? Where else would I go? I wouldn't know even if you did. Don't give me that spiteful look. Can't I joke with my sweetheart anymore? In this sad pose,
you look like that actress... Sushmita Sen. No wait, she's the tall one. The other, shorter one. I can't remember her name. But you look just like her. Go make tea for me, come on. It's done. Ali... Just a minute, child. Shammo, leave it, leave it alone. It's not your job to do. God has created women for such jobs, this is not a man's job. What else can I do, Bay ji? Oh no. I've to explain everything, Shammo. Be a man! Women never respects
a man who's afraid of them. - Do you want me to use force-
- I'm implying nothing. I'm only telling you to be a man with her. - Listen to me...
- I am listening... Stupid. I always let you have your way. I accepted Umaina for your sake. I even accepted him
with a lot of difficulties. Did I or did I not? Such a nuisance. Now I want you to do as I say. You tried being a husband. Now be a man! Umi, wake up. Feed him. He's hungry. Come on. I... I'm saying something. You'll feed him now. What... Let me go. I am talking to you. I've had enough. You'll feed him now. What right do you have on me? I am your husband. Aren't you ashamed to tell your wife, - to feed her illegitimate child.
- Umi. You completely lose your mind. Out of my way, Shameem. Take it away. You wanted me to be a man, didn't you? I never wanted to be like my father. Father was proud to be a man! Whenever he wanted
to show off his manliness, he would trash Bay ji terribly. Parts of her body would turn blue, she would suffer with broken bones. As long as father was alive, Bay ji kept praying for his death,
and now, Bay ji tells me to be a man. Be a man, son. Be like your father. Brother Abdullah's abuses, Khurram's
character, and his cheap actions, are these signs of manliness? Rukhsana gives me examples of Abdullah, and Humaira of Khurram. Look Shameem, that's a man. Be a man And now even you... Do women desire who humiliates them, beats them? Treat her like a slave? Yes? If these are signs of manliness, then shame on such men! I don't want to be a man. I like the way I am. I'm better this way. Are you crying about being a man? I am a woman. Am I not forced to be a woman? Isn't my body given
preference over my skills? I am asked to endure all the atrocities
which my father did to me. I was betrayed. I was deemed characterless. Why am I not given the
right to choose my love? See... She's got such a loud voice,
what manly laughter. She has an attitude, smokes cigarettes. Falls in love. I can't give birth at will or disown him. I cannot even reject him.
Why? If you're being forced to be a master, then you're behaving exactly
the way you're being treated. You don't understand normal people. You don't want to be like your father. Even I don't want to
be like Humaira and Rukhsana. For God's sake, this is not what I wanted. But you did. If this is what you want, Shameem, then I'll comply with you. I'll look after him, but only as your property. But I'll never forget
that he's Bilal's son. A part of my haunting past
you forced upon me.
