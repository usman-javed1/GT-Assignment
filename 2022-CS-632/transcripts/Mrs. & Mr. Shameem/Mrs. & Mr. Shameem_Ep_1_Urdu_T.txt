[136.72] Get them quickly.
[138.24] Coming.
[153.28] 'Sir!'
[155.24] 'Sir!'
[158.32] 'Roundâ€”'
[159.00] Guys, if I could get some time off...
[162.08] Bakir sir.
[163.24] Do it fast.
[164.92] Where is Bakir sir?
[168.00] 'Shajid!'
[168.60] Sir, I just need two minutes.
[284.32] Umi.
[287.68] Are you asleep again?
[296.32] Don't be lazy.
[298.92] Wake up. I've to help you get ready.
[302.60] Come on.
[303.96] I've no energy left.
[307.32] Show some mercy on me.
[312.48] Wasted all your energy at a young age.
[315.60] I told you to save some for old age.
[321.36] Come on, wake up.
[324.08] Umi.
[324.96] Stop bothering me.
[327.68] I said I don't want to go anywhere.
[330.60] Let me sleep.
[332.16] I won't let you sleep or die.
[335.44] Understood.
[341.16] Look here.
[342.72] The guys at the makeup company came
out with your favourite shade.
[347.40] Come on, get up.
[355.36] Umi.
[356.44] Shameem, don't bother me.
[361.64] Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome
you all to this prestigious event.
[366.20] I see some very excited faces here.
[369.84] And why shouldn't there be?
[372.56] Dear audience, have you ever touched silk?
[377.56] If not, then after meeting my guests today,
[382.48] you'll surely realise how it feels.
[387.68] He's a weird courageous guy,
[389.96] who challenged everyone.
[393.20] Tradition, community, even death.
[398.84] Ladies and Gentlemen,
[400.28] the brave,
the gorgeous, the inspiration...
[405.12] Please put your hands together
for Mr and Mrs Shameem.
[455.40] Sir, we're really honoured
to have you here.
[459.44] And we apologise for any inconvenience.
[465.96] We've a long history with inconvenience.
[478.32] These little inconveniences
are why we're here today.
[497.20] Interesting. Very interesting.
[501.40] There's no denying that you're
considered the symbol of hope.
[507.96] Do tell us,
[509.16] this illness scares even the best
of people out of their wits...
[514.08] I'm sure you must have
faced many challenges.
[516.52] Unfavourable conditions.
[518.44] How did you defend against
it so well with such manliness?
[522.16] This word has troubled me a lot,
all my life.
[528.48] It has troubled me a lot.
[531.68] Manliness
[612.28] Come, brother Abdullah.
[614.36] And take a look at these fools.
[617.36] Disgusting!
[621.00] Look at that Shammo.
[623.28] Eunuch.
[625.04] He's a humiliation to you
and me as well.
[630.28] You're absolutely right.
[631.64] It is disgusting.
[633.40] In fact, it is nauseating.
[637.52] I've told this eunuch dozens of times,
[641.00] to stay away from this family.
[643.72] But no one ever listens to me.
[645.44] This is a wedding,
[647.24] they should've started
with the name of Allah.
[650.16] Believe me,
I had brought sections of Quran.
[654.56] but none of these idiots even touched it.
[658.96] They are only confirming
their place in hell.
[660.72] As***
[663.16] I wonder how I got
stuck among these elegies.
[666.56] All of them are elegies.
[670.60] I seek forgiveness from Allah!
[673.52] I seek forgiveness from Allah!
[676.96] I seek forgiveness from Allah!
[684.72] A***
[686.84] Lala, I'm only going
to pay what we agreed on.
[688.68] Not a penny more.
[690.04] Don't fool me.
[691.36] Such faded colour.
[694.40] You're looking old.
[696.20] Malik sir will find a different woman.
[699.52] Forget him. He's good for nothing now.
[703.64] Go inside.
[705.24] Fajje.
[706.72] Fajje.
[708.00] Fajje...how much longer?
[709.40] Chef...the food's ready.
[711.92] No need to worry at all.
[713.88] Ammaji is getting worried unnecessarily.
[716.20] Check yourself.
[718.44] It's bland.
[720.40] Bland? What do you mean bland?
[723.48] Adding some spices.
[725.04] What are you doing, mister?
[726.84] So much chilly.
[728.92] Do you want to burn their mouth?
[732.64] They will get loose motions.
[734.16] Doesn't matter.
[735.20] Your food's always tasteless.
[736.36] I just made it a little spicier.
Doesn't matter.
[738.32] Of course.
[740.84] If I'm such a bad cook,
[742.68] then why do you employ me every time.
[744.88] You always fiddle around
with the spices. Always...
[748.64] Stop
[749.48] Cook it yourself.
[750.88] - Cook it yourself. I am going.
- Quiet. Quiet.
[752.96] - What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?
[756.28] - This is exactly why I don't leave.
- Stop it.
[759.12] Come on, hurry up.
[852.40] Go for it!
[854.04] How are you?
[854.92] I am not talking to you.
[856.24] Where were you?
[857.48] You're my best friend,
[859.16] and you've been missing from
all the action like horns on a donkey.
[861.20] I gave such a nice performance on arrival,
[862.88] don't spoil your mood now.
[866.80] I don't want to see your performance.
[868.32] Drama queen.
[870.08] Fine, I won't attend
your henna ceremony tomorrow.
[871.96] Bye.
[872.80] Don't come.
I'll invite some other performers.
[876.84] You don't need anyone else,
[878.12] when you've a brother like Shameem.
[880.24] Go for it!
[890.20] Shameem and I shared a weird relationship.
[894.44] Practically I was Salma's friend.
[898.32] But my real friend...was Shameem.
[907.28] Chimo, Chammo, Chammiya...
[910.80] These were names given by me,
[916.08] which he proudly carried like some medal.
[923.12] In our story, he was my Juliet.
[928.12] And I was his Romeo.
[982.60] Clap... clap...
[988.56] Stop this absurdity!
[994.92] What nonsense is this?
[998.24] Is this what you're teaching my daughter?
[999.32] - Are you?
- No, son.
[1000.16] - Enough, mother.
- Please, son...
[1001.52] Is this what you're teaching my daughter?
[1003.32] I seek forgiveness from Allah!
[1004.84] I seek forgiveness from Allah!
[1006.04] It's his sister's wedding.
[1011.56] It's okay. These things happen.
[1014.24] Don't mind.
[1015.28] Dinner.
[1016.32] Let's have dinner, everyone, come on.
[1018.08] - Come on, get up.
- She dropped her stole.
[1021.28] Everyone, let's have dinner.
Don't worry.
[1025.04] Come on.
[1025.56] If you behave like this again,
I will break your legs.
[1027.92] Enough, stop it.
You'll scare the kid.
[1029.48] Then tell her to act like a kid.
[1030.64] Why does she behave like a eunuch?
[1031.92] What is this language you're using?
[1033.80] Don't forget we worship Allah.
[1035.64] Are you going to teach me
how to take Allah's name?
[1038.04] Will you?
[1038.84] Will you?
[1040.12] You never talk to your brother.
[1041.72] You always ignore what he does.
[1043.60] I'll talk to him. I'll talk to everyone.
[1045.44] Henceforth no one will do anything
to make you furious. Calm down.
[1048.52] Tell me something why does
he hang out with women.
[1050.84] Doesn't he have anything better to do?
[1052.12] He's doing all the work!
[1054.12] He's looking after the
entire wedding preparations.
[1056.00] No one else does anything.
[1057.16] Witch, you think I am useless.
Good for nothing.
[1060.88] What do you mean by this?
[1061.72] Please brother Abdullah,
for God's sake I beg you.
[1064.40] All the guests are seated outside.
[1065.72] Everyone can hear you clearly.
[1067.64] Please don't treat
poor Fatima so cruely.
[1070.28] - For God's sake.
- What cruel treatment?
[1072.48] Marrying your sister was
the worst decision of my life.
[1075.80] Allah will hold me accountable for this.
[1077.96] How will I face him?
[1079.48] I am right here at your service.
[1080.72] You can slap me as many times as you want.
[1083.60] I want to slap myself.
[1087.40] May your father rest in heaven.
[1090.08] But he was a big fraud!
[1092.28] He looked like a God-loving peaceful man.
[1094.96] I had no clue that I'll end up
in this family of adulterers!
[1099.04] At least spare my father.
[1101.48] - You lose your mind in a fit of rage.
- Out of my way.
[1103.80] Out of my way, Shameem.
I said out of my way.
[1105.28] For my sake.
[1106.92] What is your problem?
Have you lost your mind?
[1110.00] Why can't you control your tongue?
[1111.44] Not a peep from you!
[1113.56] Tell her to get lost.
[1115.20] Tell her to get lost now!
[1116.24] I don't want to hear
a word from you. Shut up!
[1119.32] Shut your mouth!
And get lost from here.
[1121.88] Come on, get out.
[1123.08] Go sit with the guests.
[1124.72] Get out.
[1126.28] Causing nuisance!
[1127.68] Look at this.
[1129.68] Look, brother Abdullah,
[1132.04] it's especially embroidered
from Hyderabad.
[1135.48] I know since you've such fair skin,
[1138.32] this colour will suit you.
[1140.72] How is it?
[1153.88] I haven't seen a single day
of joy in this house.
[1159.60] Not a single day.
[1162.96] What sin are my children paying for?
[1165.28] I don't understand.
[1166.60] I don't understand.
[1168.28] Bay ji, for God's sake,
stop cursing yourself all the time.
[1172.36] What else can I do?
[1173.92] What else can I do if not curse myself?
[1176.24] That brother-in-law of yours,
[1177.88] I wonder what he thinks of us.
[1180.28] He's always abusing us. Always...
[1183.80] It's all your father's fault...
[1186.52] It's his fault that
he wanted his daughter,
[1188.44] to get married in a Maulvi family.
[1190.00] Said it will bring prosperity, goodwill.
[1191.44] This is prosperity.
[1192.40] This is prosperity.
[1194.52] At least Rukhi is happy.
[1197.08] So what if he's a little short-tempered.
[1199.12] His temper cools down instantly.
[1202.04] That's nonsense. Don't lie to me.
[1204.84] He would make skin your sister alive,
[1207.08] and make shoes out of
them if he isn't controlled.
[1209.28] And that other rascal...
[1213.84] Good for nothing.
[1217.28] Why Allah doesn't bless my Humaira,
with children?
[1220.32] I don't know what Allah wants from us.
[1223.56] Okay, fine. Stop it now.
[1226.20] Why do you always rake up old wounds?
[1228.56] Quiet. Quiet.
[1238.32] Hug.
[1240.00] You and your hugs.
[1243.52] I've a question, mother.
[1245.36] What was on your mind when she was born?
[1246.48] I don't think she was born out of love.
[1248.36] Be quiet.
[1249.56] Shameless.
[1251.04] She looks just like her father.
[1252.92] No, mother.
[1254.32] She's so cute.
She's got such sharp features.
[1260.04] Leave him.
[1263.96] Bye. Let me get back to work.
[1266.72] Stay away. Stay away.
[1276.68] You're so stubborn.
[1317.08] Hey Madhubala.
[1321.64] Are you crying?
[1331.44] How about a cup of tea?
[1335.84] I'll get it.
[1368.80] What's wrong?
[1372.04] Nothing.
[1373.92] All good?
[1383.04] Are you having your periods?
[1385.24] Don't be absurd.
[1388.92] Now I am sure something
is wrong with my sweetheart.
[1391.96] Speak up. What's wrong?
[1397.20] I feel you're not well either.
[1404.48] Have you seen your face lately?
[1406.80] You should.
[1410.80] Your eyes look tired. It's lost all gleam.
[1417.28] Are you very tired?
[1419.84] Yes, very tired.
[1424.08] I'll give you a massage if you like?
[1449.52] Lower. Lower.
[1451.96] Okay, fine.
[1455.32] - Umi, did you miss me?
- I did.
[1460.60] More than Salma.
[1463.40] You're my best friend,
[1466.16] you know all my dirty secrets.
[1469.16] Don't tell anyone.
[1470.92] You can never think of me as a man.
[1473.28] I wouldn't tell you to massage
me if I thought of you as a man.
[1476.92] I see...
[1478.84] Then what do you think of that Mr Macho?
[1486.12] - Come here.
- I was just joking.
[1487.48] I was just joking.
[1489.56] Why did you put on weight?
[1493.20] Are you pregnant?
[1497.08] Shameem.
[1498.04] - I am tired. Get lost.
- I didn't mean it.
[1499.80] -I swear I didn't mean it.
- Leave.
[1501.12] Oh, come on.
[1503.88] You've come after so long.
[1505.48] Get used to it.
I'm not coming henceforth.
[1510.16] Why?
[1512.32] Salma is getting married.
[1514.20] What business do I have here now?
[1518.32] What about me?
[1520.44] Can't you come to see me?
[1522.52] I don't have time for this nonsense.
I'm very tired.
[1524.48] Get up and get lost.
[1526.24] Hey!
[1527.28] Go on.
[1528.56] And turn off the lights.
[1529.80] - Okay, fine.
- Go on.
[1532.32] Listen...
[1533.36] Finish your tea before it gets cold.
[1537.92] Go.
[1589.68] Hurry up.
[1602.40] Well, the exchange of sweets
and gifts are done.
[1603.88] It's a good thing.
[1604.80] But how can the ceremony
be complete without dance?
[1607.36] Mother, the ceremony
will look unentertaining.
[1609.16] Stop it.
[1610.32] You know brother-in-law
doesn't approve of this.
[1613.32] So we shouldn't celebrate
the way we want,
[1615.28] because of the fear of one man.
[1616.56] We should mourn instead.
[1617.60] - What are you saying?
- Be quiet.
[1620.40] Chammo.
[1622.28] It's your sister's henna ceremony.
[1623.60] How can you not dance?
[1625.04] Isn't that right, guys?
[1626.40] Yeah...
[1629.04] Come on, Chammo, show them your moves.
[1633.96] Where are you going?
[1635.12] You didn't apply any henna has yet.
[1636.40] Sit down.
[1637.16] These guys don't care at all.
[1639.88] I am the one who will get in trouble.
[1641.40] You won't get in any kind of trouble.
[1642.68] You won't get in any kind of trouble.
[1643.96] They will be careful.
Don't worry.
[1646.32] It's okay. Stay.
[1648.84] Mom, you worry about your children,
[1651.12] and let me worry about mine.
[1653.12] Wait...
[1812.12] Umi.
[1822.40] Water.
[1831.12] Are you okay?
[1835.44] Yes.
[1842.40] It's an old habit of his.
[1846.16] He's always present at the wrong place,
for the right motive.
[1855.40] Coming.
[1857.16] I warned you no boys in this hostel.
[1861.04] Ma'am, does he look like a guy to you.
[1863.04] Hey, say hello to ma'am.
[1864.56] Hello.
[1865.64] Hello.
[1867.72] Be rest assured.
[1868.72] He's completely useless.
[1870.40] If you don't believe
me come and look for yourself.
[1872.28] Can I go, ma'am?
[1873.80] Please?
[1874.60] - Go on then.
- Thank you.
[1876.08] She thinks you're a guy.
[1880.28] Coming.
[1895.12] Who is it?
[1896.16] It's me Shameem.
[1898.00] Come in.
[1900.88] Are you taking a shower?
[1902.12] It's nothing vulgar.
[1904.40] Come in. I've nothing to hide from you.
[1910.44] Here. Take it.
[1911.84] What is it?
[1912.84] I've got a cigarette for you.
[1914.40] Light it.
[1923.72] What happened?
[1926.20] What are you doing? It's painful.
[1927.92] Everyone has the same complaint about me.
[1933.28] What are you looking at?
[1935.68] Moustache.
[1936.68] There's no way he's going
to like me with such big moustaches.
[1939.88] You know what,
handsome, go get some thread.
[1943.96] What for?
[1945.32] Stitch clothes, what do you think?
[1946.44] Just get the thread.
[1956.44] Here you go.
[1957.96] Start.
[1959.52] And do what?
[1960.64] Get rid of my moustache.
[1961.64] Okay, fine. Don't be so cranky.
[1965.68] It will be painful.
[1967.12] Men don't feel pain.
[1968.48] Go for it.
[1970.08] Are you sure? Should I go ahead?
[1973.40] Fine...
[1977.64] Wait, Umi.
[1979.12] Hurry up.
[1979.92] Umi. Wait.
[1983.48] What are you doing?
[1994.32] Why are you looking
at him as a desperate woman?
[1998.64] Me or you?
[2001.32] Stop fighting like a woman.
[2004.20] Why are we spying on him?
[2006.16] Either under that tree
or behind those bushes.
[2009.24] What are we doing?
[2010.80] Love.
[2012.32] That's for you. What am I doing?
[2014.84] Support.
[2015.88] Tomorrow when our love story
will be written,
[2017.64] you'll have an important role in it.
[2019.44] Now be quiet and let me look at him.
[2022.16] I wonder what you see in this ape.
[2024.48] Ape?
[2025.68] He's a gorilla.
[2027.80] Just like a gorilla...
[2029.28] I mean, he's got all
the ingredients that of a man.
[2031.52] Check out his muscles, and his style.
[2034.80] It's not easy to build biceps.
[2036.92] What a criteria for choosing men?
[2038.72] Muscles, biceps.
[2039.88] Be quiet. Now listen.
[2041.16] I'll be crossing him,
[2042.28] you see whether he notices me or not.
[2045.08] Am I looking okay?
[2048.92] Cute.
[2049.72] Thank you.
[2079.92] I swear...my heart's about to jump out.
[2084.12] Thank God your heart's ready to jump out.
[2088.24] What do want to do?
[2090.48] Trying to build some confidence.
[2094.12] Do you lack any confidence right now?
[2096.80] No, I think I've enough confidence.
[2098.24] I'll manage.
[2100.24] Manage to do what?
[2101.84] Propose?
[2103.08] Who?
[2104.48] You, of course.
[2105.80] To Bilal, of course.
[2109.32] You're going to propose to him.
[2111.48] Why can't I propose to him?
[2114.80] I mean, aren't guys supposed to propose?
[2118.96] Sweetheart, those days are gone,
[2122.20] when only guys used to propose to girls.
[2124.68] Watch what I do?
[2128.88] For God's sake...
[2130.96] - You're such a coward.
- Look ahead.
[2133.92] - Now watch.
- Look ahead.
[2136.64] For God's sake...
[2139.00] What are we doing here?
Why bring me here?
[2143.84] How long can you keep quiet?
[2145.60] Can you not ask questions for a while?
[2147.68] Stop disturbing me and let me concentrate.
[2152.08] Concentrate on who?
[2155.20] Fine, I won't ask.
[2164.60] Hey, Bilal.
[2167.72] Who, me?
[2169.60] Yes, you.
[2171.84] You see I'm in love with your biceps.
[2174.44] What to do?
[2175.48] Let's see...what can we do?
[2177.88] Would you like my biceps then?
[2179.24] How about I get you too as a bonus?
[2186.48] He's taken the bait.
[2188.24] Hello, your trainer's laughing.
[2194.20] Hey!
[2195.48] So when should I come next
for the workout?
[2196.92] What's your name?
[2197.96] Umaina.
[2199.24] Working out in such a crowded place
is not good.
[2202.80] Umi...
[2203.64] Go for private sessions.
[2205.24] Whoa!
[2206.16] Umi...
[2209.24] Umi...
[2213.40] He kept calling me,
[2217.44] but I couldn't hear him.
[2222.60] I was lost in the affection of a guy.
[2236.24] A man who fit every aspect of masculinity.
[2239.56] Tall, dashing, handsome, bodybuilder,
[2247.36] who could easily lift me with one arm.
[2252.56] And with the same ease,
he brought me crashing down on the ground.
[2264.88] This is not the time or the occasion.
[2267.20] - Let's talk later.
- I want to talk now.
[2269.04] Umi, please don't create a scene.
[2271.04] We can create a scene right now,
[2272.96] or you can listen to me quietly.
Go upstairs, I am coming.
[2282.48] Don't you know what my problem is?
[2285.52] - Can we talk about this later?
- How much later?
[2288.72] Later? Later?
[2289.88] I've been trying
to say something for three months,
[2291.56] but you don't understand.
[2292.48] Even I've been f*** saying
for three months,
[2294.24] to get rid of it.
[2295.24] F**** get an abortion
and f*** get rid of it!
[2297.44] Why should I commit this
sin of getting an abortion?
[2299.48] Why can't you own up
and take responsibility?
[2301.96] Why?
[2302.96] I had no such commitment to you.
[2306.12] What?
[2308.20] You told me dozens of times
that 'you' want to marry me.
[2312.24] Didn't you say that?
[2313.04] - Yes, and I still want to marry me.
- So?
[2314.44] I want to marry you.
[2315.80] But that doesn't mean you
get pregnant with someone else...
[2318.68] What?
[2320.48] What did you say?
[2322.80] Some...
[2339.32] How stupid of me?
[2341.44] With someone else?
[2355.88] This is not what I thought you were.
[2362.04] Listen to me.
[2365.24] You must get rid of this.
[2369.92] This cannot go on like this.
[2372.08] And honestly,
I'm not even sure it's mine.
[2383.72] Is your father sure
that you're one of his?
[2386.68] What did you say?
[2388.24] What did you say?
[2390.88] What did you f**** say?
[2393.40] What did you say?
[2394.44] Now listen to me carefully.
[2396.00] If you try to contact me again,
[2399.52] then I'll strip you naked like whores,
and make a spectacle of you.
[2404.04] Go tell the guy you slept
to own up to this!
[2407.32] Understood!
[2419.92] Umi.
[2421.12] Umi.
[2422.04] Umi. What's wrong?
[2423.72] What's wrong?
[2424.88] Umi.
[2425.68] Shall I get some water?
[2427.44] Shall I get some water for you?
[2429.00] I'll go get some water for you.
