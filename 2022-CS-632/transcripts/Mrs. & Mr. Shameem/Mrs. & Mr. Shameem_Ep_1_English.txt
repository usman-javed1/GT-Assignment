Get them quickly. Coming. 'Sir!' 'Sir!' 'Roundâ€”' Guys, if I could get some time off... Bakir sir. Do it quickly. Where is Bakir sir? 'Shajid!' Sir, I just need two minutes. Umi. Are you asleep again? Don't be lazy. Wake up.  I've got to help you get ready. Come on. I have no energy left. Show me some mercy. Wasted all your energy at a young age. I told you to save some for old age. Come on, wake up. Umi. Stop bothering me. I said I don't want to go anywhere. Let me sleep. I won't let you sleep or die. Understood. Look here. The guys at the makeup company came
out with your favorite shade. Come on, get up. Umi. Shameem, don't bother me. Ladies and Gentlemen, I welcome
you all to this prestigious event. I see some very excited faces here. And why shouldn't there be? Dear audience, have you ever touched silk? If not, then after meeting my guests today, you'll surely realize how it feels. He's a weird courageous guy, who challenged everyone. Tradition, community, even death. Ladies and Gentlemen, the brave,
the gorgeous, the inspiration... Please put your hands together
for Mr and Mrs Shameem. Sir, we're really honored
to have you here. And we apologize for any inconvenience. We've a long history with inconvenience. These little inconveniences
are why we're here today. Interesting.  Very interesting. There's no denying that you're
considered the symbol of hope. Do tell us, this illness scares even the best
of people out of their wits... I'm sure you must have
faced many challenges. Unfavorable conditions. How did you defend against
it so well with such manliness? This word has troubled me a lot,
all my life. It has troubled me a lot. Manliness Come, brother Abdullah. And take a look at these fools. Disgusting! Look at that Shammo. Eunuch. He's a humiliation to you
and me as well. You're absolutely right. It is disgusting. In fact, it is nauseating. I've told this eunuch dozens of times, to stay away from this family. But no one ever listens to me. This is a wedding, they should've started
with the name of Allah. Believe me,
I had brought sections of the Quran. but none of these idiots even touched it. They are only confirming
their place in hell. As*** I wonder how I got
stuck among these elegies. All of them are elegies. I seek forgiveness from Allah! I seek forgiveness from Allah! I seek forgiveness from Allah! A*** Lala, I'm only going
to pay what we agreed on. Not a penny more. Don't fool me. Such faded color. You're looking old. Malik sir will find a different woman. Forget him.  He's good for nothing now. Go inside. Fajje. Fajje. Wow...how much longer? Chef...the food's ready. No need to worry at all. Ammaji is getting worried unnecessarily. Check yourself. It's bland.  Bland? What do you mean bland? Adding some spices. What are you doing, mister? So much chilly. Do you want to burn their mouth? They will get loose motions. Doesn't matter. Your food is always tasteless. I just made it a little spicier.
Doesn't matter. Of course. If I'm such a bad cook, then why do you employ me every time. You always fiddle around
with the spices.  Always... Stop cooking it yourself. - Cook it yourself.  I am going.
- Quiet.  Quiet. - What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind? - This is exactly why I don't leave.
- Stop it. Come on, hurry up. Go for it! How are you? I am not talking to you. Where were you? You're my best friend, and you've been missing from
all the action like horns on a donkey. I gave such a nice performance on arrival, don't spoil your mood now. I don't want to see your performance. Drama queen. Fine, I won't attend
your henna ceremony tomorrow. Bye. Don't come.
I'll invite some other performers. You don't need anyone else, when you've a brother like Shameem. Go for it! Shameem and I shared a weird relationship. Practically I was Salma's friend. But my real friend...was Shameem. Chimo, Chammo, Chammiya... These were names given by me, which he proudly carried like some medal. In our story, he was my Juliet. And I was his Romeo. Clap... clap... Stop this absurdity! What nonsense is this? Is this what you're teaching my daughter? - Are you?
- No, son. - Enough, mother.
- Please, son... Is this what you're teaching my daughter? I seek forgiveness from Allah! I seek forgiveness from Allah! It's his sister's wedding. It's okay.  These things happen. Don't mind. Dinner. Let's have dinner, everyone, come on. - Come on, get up.
- She dropped her stole. Everyone, let's have dinner.
Don't worry. Come on. If you behave like this again,
I will break your legs. Enough, stop it.
You'll scare the kid. Then tell her to act like a kid. Why does she behave like a eunuch? What is this language you're using? Don't forget we worship Allah. Are you going to teach me
how to take Allah's name? Will you? Will you? You never talk to your brother. You always ignore what he does. I'll talk to him.  I'll talk to everyone. From now on, no one will do anything
to make you angry.  Calm down. Tell me something why does
he hang out with women. Doesn't he have anything better to do? He's doing all the work! He's looking after the
entire wedding preparations. No one else does anything. Witch, you think I am useless.
Good for nothing. What do you mean by this? Please brother Abdullah,
for God's sake I beg you. All the guests are seated outside. Everyone can hear you clearly. Please don't treat
poor Fatima so cruelly. - For God's sake.
- What cruel treatment? Marrying your sister was
the worst decision of my life. Allah will hold me accountable for this. How will I face him? I am right here at your service. You can slap me as many times as you want. I want to slap myself. May your father rest in heaven. But he was a big fraud! He looked like a God-loving peaceful man. I had no clue that I'd end up
in this family of adulterers! At least spare my father. - You lose your mind in a fit of rage.
- Out of my way. Out of my way, Shameem.
I said out of my way. For my sake. What is your problem?
Have you lost your mind? Why can't you control your tongue? Not a peep from you! Tell her to get lost. Tell her to get lost now! I don't want to hear
a word from you.  Shut up! Shut your mouth!
And get lost from here. Come on, get out. Go sit with the guests. Get out. Causing nuisance! Look at this. Look, brother Abdullah, it's specially embroidered
from Hyderabad. I know since you've such fair skin, this color will suit you. How is it? I haven't seen a single day
of joy in this house. Not a single day. What sin are my children paying for? I don't understand. I don't understand. Bay ji, for God's sake,
stop cursing yourself all the time. What else can I do? What else can I do if not curse myself? That brother-in-law of yours, I wonder what he thinks of us. He's always abusing us.  Always... It's all your father's fault... It's his fault that
he wanted his daughter to get married in a Maulvi family. Said it will bring prosperity, goodwill. This is prosperity. This is prosperity. At least Rukhi is happy. So what if he's a little short-tempered. His temper cools down instantly. That's nonsense.  Don't lie to me. He would skin your sister alive, and make shoes out of
them if he isn't controlled. And that other rascal... Good for nothing. Why doesn't Allah bless my Humaira
with children? I don't know what Allah wants from us. Okay, fine.  Stop it now. Why do you always rake up old wounds? Quiet.  Quiet. Hug. You and your hugs. I have a question, mother. What was on your mind when she was born? I don't think she was born out of love. Be quiet. Shameless. She looks just like her father. No, mother. She's so cute.
She's got such sharp features. Leave him. Bye.  Let me get back to work. Stay away.  Stay away. You're so stubborn. Hey Madhubala. Are you crying? How about a cup of tea? I'll get it. What's wrong? Nothing. All good? Are you having your periods? Don't be absurd. Now I am sure something
is wrong with my sweetheart. Speak up.  What's wrong? I feel you're not well either. Have you seen your face lately? You should. Your eyes look tired.  It's lost all luster. Are you very tired? Yes, very tired. I'll give you a massage if you like? Lower.  Lower. Okay, fine. - Umi, did you miss me?
- I did. More than Salma. You're my best friend, you know all my dirty secrets. Don't tell anyone. You can never think of me as a man. I wouldn't tell you to massage
me if I thought of you as a man. I see... Then what do you think of that Mr Macho? - Come here.
- I was just joking. I was just joking. Why did you put on weight? Are you pregnant? Shameem. - I am tired.  Get lost.
- I didn't mean it. -I swear I didn't mean it.
- Leave. Oh, come on. You've come after so long. Get used to it.
I'm not coming henceforth. Why? Salma is getting married. What business do I have here now? What about me? Can't you come to see me? I don't have time for this nonsense.
I'm very tired. Get up and get lost. Hey! Go on. And turn off the lights. - Okay, fine.
- Go on. Listen... Finish your tea before it gets cold. Go. Hurry up. Well, the exchange of sweets
and gifts is done. It's a good thing. But how can the ceremony
be complete without dancing? Mother, the ceremony
will look unentertaining. Stop it. You know brother-in-law
doesn't approve of this. So we shouldn't celebrate
the way we want, because of the fear of one man. We should mourn instead. - What are you saying?
- Be quiet. Chammo. It's your sister's henna ceremony. How can you not dance? Isn't that right, guys? Yeah... Come on, Chammo, show them your moves. Where are you going? You haven't applied any henna yet. Sit down. These guys don't care at all. I am the one who will get into trouble. You won't get into any kind of trouble. You won't get into any kind of trouble. They will be careful.
Don't worry. It's okay.  Stay. Mom, you worry about your children, and let me worry about mine. Wait... Umi. Water. Are you okay? Yes. It's an old habit of his. He's always present at the wrong place,
for the right motive. Coming. I warned you, no boys in this hostel. Ma'am, does he look like a guy to you? Hey, say hello to ma'am. Hello. Hello. Rest assured. He's completely useless. If you don't believe
me, come and see for yourself. Can I go, ma'am? Please? - Go on then.
- Thank you. She thinks you're a guy. Coming. Who is it? It's me Shameem. Come in. Are you taking a shower? It's nothing vulgar. Come in.  I have nothing to hide from you. Here.  Take it. What is it? I've got a cigarette for you. Light it. What happened? What are you doing?  It's painful. Everyone has the same complaint about me. What are you looking at? Moustache. There's no way he's going
to like me with such big moustaches. You know what,
handsome, go get some thread. What for? Stitch clothes, what do you think? Just get the thread. Here you go. Start. And do what? Get rid of my mustache. Okay, fine.  Don't be so cranky. It will be painful. Men don't feel pain. Go for it. Are you sure?  Should I go ahead? Fine... Wait, Umi. Hurry up. Umi.  Wait. What are you doing? Why are you looking
at him like a desperate woman? Me or you? Stop fighting like a woman. Why are we spying on him? Either under that tree
or behind those bushes. What are we doing? Love. That's for you.  What am I doing? Support. Tomorrow when our love story
will be written, you will have an important role in it. Now be quiet and let me look at him. I wonder what you see in this ape. Ape? He's a gorilla. Just like a gorilla... I mean, he's got all
the ingredients that of a man. Check out his muscles, and his style. It's not easy to build biceps. What a criteria for choosing men? Muscles, biceps. Be quiet.  Now listen. I'll be crossing him, you'll see whether he notices me or not. Am I looking okay? Cute. Thank you. I swear...my heart's about to jump out. Thank God your heart's ready to jump out. What do you want to do? Trying to build some confidence. Do you lack any confidence right now? No, I think I've got enough confidence. I'll manage. Manage to do what? Propose? Who? You, of course. To Bilal, of course. You're going to propose to him. Why can't I propose to him? I mean, aren't guys supposed to propose? Sweetheart, those days are gone, when only guys used to propose to girls. Watch what I do? For God's sake... - You're such a coward.
- Look ahead. - Now watch.
- Look ahead. For God's sake... What are we doing here?
Why bring me here? How long can you keep quiet? Can't you ask questions for a while? Stop disturbing me and let me concentrate. Concentrate on who? Fine, I won't ask. Hey, Bilal. Who, me? Yes, you. You see I'm in love with your biceps. What to do? Let's see...what can we do? Would you like my biceps then? How about I get you too as a bonus? He's taken the bait. Hello, your trainer's laughing. Hey! So when should I come next
for the workout? What's your name? Umaina. Working out in such a crowded place
is not good. Umi... Go for private sessions. Whoa! Umi... Umi... He kept calling me, but I couldn't hear him. I was lost in the affection of a guy. A man who fits every aspect of masculinity. Tall, dashing, handsome, bodybuilder, who could easily lift me with one arm. And with the same ease,
he brought me crashing down on the ground. This is not the time or the occasion. - Let's talk later.
- I want to talk now. Umi, please don't create a scene. We can create a scene right now, or you can listen to me quietly.
Go upstairs, I'm coming. Don't you know what my problem is? - Can we talk about this later?
- How much later? Later?  Later? I've been trying
to say something for three months, but you don't understand. Even I've been saying f***
for three months, to get rid of it. F**** get an abortion
and f*** get rid of it! Why should I commit this
sin of getting an abortion? Why can't you own up
and take responsibility? Why? I had no such commitment to you. What? You told me dozens of times
that 'you' want to marry me. Didn't you say that? - Yes, and I still want to marry me.
- So? I want to marry you. But that doesn't mean you
get pregnant with someone else... What? What did you say? Some... How stupid of me? With someone else? This is not what I thought you were. Listen to me. You must get rid of this. This cannot go on like this. And honestly,
I'm not even sure it's mine. Is your father sure
that you're one of his? What did you say? What did you say? What did you f**** say? What did you say? Now listen to me carefully. If you try to contact me again, then I'll strip you naked like [ __ ],
and make a spectacle of you. Go tell the guy you slept with
to own up to this! Understood! Umi. Umi. Umi.  What's wrong? What's wrong? Umi. Shall I get some water? Shall I get some water for you? I'll go get some water for you.
