Ali, wake up son. You'll be late for school. Ali. What did you do? Mama, papa is looking like a princess. Stupid, is this how you behave with papa? Get up. - What happened?
- Nothing, he's being naughty. Let's go. Here's your shirt. Put it on my head. Keep it over there. There's no need to
get irritated at this hour. It's your shirt. I am obliged. Let me kiss your hands. Why can't you ever be polite? Other husbands are so caring. But you... They have a reason. I'll treat you nicely
when I've a reason to. Bam! Bloody dog- Let it be, he's just a kid. What are you doing? It's just water. It will dry up soon. Just water. Would you be pleased
if it was acid instead? Bas*** For God's sake,
please don't use that word! What else does one call a bas***? Iron it again. And I don't want to
see a single stain of water. If I see him again, I will rip him apart! Go on and hurry up. What am I hearing? Why did you do it? Say sorry to uncle. Ali, say sorry. Why should I? Why not? It was your fault! Say sorry. - Because I don't like him.
- Ali! End of conversation. If he doesn't like me,
then this was planned. Bay ji, he might shoot me tomorrow, because he doesn't like me. Don't make a mountain out of a mole. He doesn't know what he's saying. He's not a child. He's a... Bay ji, he's a child, but you're not. You haven't said a word. I would if you let me. Come on, son, he's older than you. Now apologise. Come on. Say sorry Ali, or else I will slap you. - Say sorry.
- Umi, what are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Everyone's judging him
like he's committed murder. You don't know what he's done, Shammo. I know, Bay ji, I heard everything. So what if he dropped water on his shirt? He's just a child. But the rest of you are acting like kids. No one knew how to
spoil better than Shameem. He did the same with Ali. He wouldn't see beyond his father. Everyone else meant nothing to him.
Not even me. He was the apple of his father's eye. He was Shameem's entire world, No stone was left unturned
to spoil the work. Because she had changed completely. Right? What are you doing? Leave it. I'll do it. What are you doing? Go get ready. Don't you want
to attend the Salon's opening? Exactly, women need more time. I'll need only a couple of minutes.
Leave it. I am not going, Shameem. What do you mean? I'm starting a new business, and I won't do it without you. You know I don't go anywhere,
so stop insisting. This is exactly why I want
you to step out of this confinement. I want that old Umi back. Leave it. Go and get ready quickly. Go on. You did the right thing
by putting tape on it. It's nice. Very nice. It's beautiful. Isn't it? It's much more beautiful on the inside. Very beautiful. Your older sister and
Fatima didn't show up. You know about brother Abdullah, he doesn't approve of such things. Everything we do is a sin for him. Forget it, Bay ji. It's time to celebrate,
don't spoil your mood. I am telling you no one likes
to see Shammo happy. - They are all jealous of him.
- Fine, stop it now. Congratulations,
Shameem sir, you've been going places. First the clubhouse now this salon. Can I get a discount? Of course. With hard work, one can go places. Who is cutting the ribbon? My lucky charm, my Ali. Ali will inaugurate the place. What are you doing, Shameem, Give it to Bay ji,
she will do the honours. No, I will cut the ribbon. Papa, I will cut the ribbon. Don't insist, son. Come on, okay. Happy? Come, let's inaugurate the place. - Stand here.
- Come on, Bay ji. Come with me. Good boy. Take a picture. Come. Come, Bay ji. Let's do this. Here... Come, Bay ji. Let's all go inside. Very good. Give me that. Come, we'll give the first haircut to Ali. This is really unbelievable. Letting another child inaugurate
the place when your mother's still around. Wonderful. Shammo aunty is a piece of work. For God's sake,
don't say anything in front of Bay ji, She's already pretty sad. Bay ji... Congratulations, along with the ribbon, he also cut off your honour. Leave her alone, brother Khurram. Shameem... Go, spend some time with Bay ji. They are having a good time. Shameem, she looks upset. No, she is fine. It's absolutely right, isn't it? Did I say anything wrong? Why don't you stick
that scissor in my neck? Rascal. Why are you getting mad at me? He let that child cut the ribbon... If not the ribbon,
can we at least get some juice? This is unfair. - Greetings.
- Hello. You guys didn't show up for the opening, so I thought I'll personally
bring the sweets over. - Here you go.
- Please come. Greetings. Hello.
Here you go. How is it? It's... How was the opening? Very nice. Keep it. - Go on.
- Okay. Brother Abdullah,
you didn't even taste the sweets. It's delicious made in clarified butter. It's banned for us. Why else would people commit sin? I know you don't like salons, but believe me, it's the latest trend. It's a money-minting business. It's a trend of evil and mischief. One has to tread carefully. There's a thin line between
acceptable and unacceptable. You were dealing in clothes. Why do you wander in these businesses? Are you not worried about your image? Tea. When is Fatima coming back? It's been ages since I last saw her. And you never will. She has gone through the ablution ritual. She has become a religious scholar. She will stay behind a veil. What are you saying? Why hide behind a veil from her uncle? Yes... And from an uncle like him. My daughter is a pious child. She's my salvation. By the way,
you should worry about Ali too. You should make Ali go through
the ablution ritual as well. You're building a pathway to hell. Give it a thought. Forget him. Drink your tea. You too. Everything hurts. I am rendered useless. - You called Bay ji.
- Yes, I did. Because you don't
show your face otherwise. You need to be summoned. Why are you upset? Tell me what's wrong- -Stand up, come on. On your feet. Oh, God. Leave it. Go back to the one you truly love. Who are you talking about? Why did you tell her to take up a job? Because she's always in the kitchen. I thought a job would
boost her confidence. Don't you remember the old Umi? Yes, I remember. I don't see how it makes a difference. Listen, don't you want your children. What do you mean? What do I mean? Don't act na√Øve now. Don't you want your own children? You two have been married for ages, but to what avail. We've Ali,
Bay ji, why do we need more children? Yes, of course. We've Ali, he's our prince. I am talking about your child.
Your flesh and blood. Shammo, when will you make me a grandma? Stop it, Bay ji, don't say such things. Why not? Now listen to me carefully, you may find it harsh. You'll hate me for this. But let me be completely honest with you. Your wife isn't yours anymore. She didn't have anyone to support her. She was helpless. That's why she took
your support and came here. That's why she's always in the kitchen. She has no attachment with you. And that thing you're trying to boost... Confidence. Exactly. This is my point. If you boost her confidence, she will fly away like a bird. - Okay, enough. Enough, Bay ji.
- What...? I could never imagine
you'd say such a thing. How can you be so selfish? Yes, I am selfish. I am selfish. Do you see selfishness in my eyes? You have... Get lost. Tomorrow when I die,
no one will treat you well. Listen to me carefully, Shammo. If she really wanted to bear your child, she could've done it at any time.
But she didn't. Because she knows. She knows once she becomes a mother, she will have to stay here forever. She will never do it.
She will never do it. Come on, Bay ji. Stop it, Bay ji, leave it. Mrs. Shameem,
do you still didn't love Mr. Shameem? What is love? Can you explain? If the lust for each other's body is love, then yes, I didn't love him. And if love is about respect. how could I love him
when I never respected him? And when I started respecting
him to the extent of worship, how could I love him? I had placed him on a pedestal. Can anyone love God,
the way he loves humans? Shameem had brought me
home like a lotus from a pond. Who else could do such a thing? I had no choice but to accept him as God. Just like I gave life to Ali in my womb, similarly, Shameem groomed
me with his hands into a new person. A new life. Papa, please teach me. Teach me how to bowl. Ali, I never played cricket in my life. I can teach you to play Ludo. Please papa or else I'll lose the match. I don't know cricket,
Ali, but I can teach you Ludo. Wait... Khurram, come teach him cricket. I don't know these childish games. I can teach him one of my adult games. Papa... You're my super papa. You bowl and I'll bat. At least try, papa. Oh, God. But I don't know how, Ali. Try for my sake. Okay, fine. Shammo, try bowling straight, and it'll flail on its own. Come on. How was the match today, Ali? What happened? Doesn't matter.
Winning and losing is common in sports. It's a part of the game. What is this way, Ali? Why is the place so dirty? Here. This is ready. Finish it quickly. and tomorrow morning my son
will fly to his school like a superhero, and win all matches. I don't want it. Drink it, Ali. I said I don't want it. Ali! What are you doing? You made him angry. You act like kids too. He's lost his mind. Bismillah! Bismillah! Bismillah! Welcome, Abdullah sir. How are you? Take a seat. Fatima's coming. I apologise for the wait. Don't apologise. You are my daughter's teacher. You have made her life. You made her a religious scholar. I want to kiss your hands. In fact, you're almost God to me, so how can I not apologise to you? This isn't right. Abdullah sir, Fatima is a bright girl. Of course. She takes no time
in finishing her lessons. Good. I've sensed a rebellion
in her personality, Oh Lord. but she is a fast learner. In fact, you should get
another advanced course for her. As you wish. And this rebellious nature
comes from her mother. I always say these bones
and flesh are yours. You have a right over them. Your punishments will lead
my daughter to victory. God bless you. God bless you. You performed a miracle. There you go, Fatima's here. What am I hearing?
What has Maulana sir been saying? It was just a concern. Don't treat it like a complaint. She is a very good kid. Go on, child. Go with your father. God bless you. Ali...don't do it. Ali...Ali... Listen, give your father a hug. No! Not even when father
picks you up from school. Don't pick me up from school, father. Never again. Ali. I hope it's properly made,
sister-in-law Umaina. I don't want this to make me look uglier. You've such beautiful features. Why do you talk so negatively? A face everyone ignores. If you don't love yourself,
no one will love you. Doesn't matter what I
do I'll always be unfortunate. Forget about prince charming, even a cobbler wouldn't choose me. I am not as beautiful as you, to get a devoted husband like
brother Shameem. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? I thought I looked decent.
Do I look worse now? I meant your language. You're uttering nonsense. Even you used to be a loudmouth like this. Don't you remember? Our disapprovals were just a pretense, in reality, we were jealous of you. Me, Humaira, Rukhsana... Everyone. Wash it after 15 minutes, and tell me if you notice any difference. Apply some on my hands as well. Umaina... Hmm? I went to the market
and bought this shirt for Ali Can you give it to him? Why don't you give it yourself? No, how can I... Shammo doesn't like
me anywhere around him. Even I've been completely unfair to him. I never even apologised to you. Please find the heart to forgive me. I remember nothing. You should forget it too. How can I? Even God won't forgive me. It's true what they say... Disappointment changes
a person completely. Anyway, I don't want anything else. I would love it if Ali wears this shirt. Thank you. Wow...this shirt looks new.
When did you buy it? It's a gift from Humaira. Humaira? Why did you accept the shirt from her? Don't you know her nature? I wonder what spell she's cast on it. And anyway he's been
angry with me recently, I wonder why? He's lost his mind which I'll fix. And this shirt's looking so nice. He's looking handsome like his papa. I am not like papa! He's so sissy! What did you say? Yes, he's a sissy. Everyone says this. He's not my hero. - I'll slap you, Ali-
- What are you doing? Leave me. You're not my papa. Who taught you that? Come here! He's just... Can I sit here with you please? No. Please let me sit here. Sit. My name is Raaim Bilal and yours? Ali Shameem. Shameem? That's a funny name. Okay, sorry. Can I show you something? Mobile. It's not allowed in here. Doesn't matter, my father can bring the
entire school down with a punch. No one can stop me. See, that's my dad.
He's a weight-lifting champion. Good morning teacher! Thank you, teacher! You haven't brought Ali from school yet. Shameem? It's your job to bring him home now. Why me? He's just a kid. Don't mind him. But he is right. He must hate seeing
me in front of his friends. Yay! How are you my tiger? - Huh?
- Good. Ali, check where papa is. I don't care. Ali, go and check. Can't you see I am busy? Ali, I've been controlling
myself only because of your father. If you misbehave again, I will set you straight for good! Go check where he is. Get up. What is your problem? Why are you calling now?
What do you want? Aunty, where is Ali? Who? This is Raaim. Fatima, you went to
bathe without hot water. I told you the geyser isn't working. I told your father to get it fixed. But he never listens. Take this water.
Don't bathe with cold water. Or you'll catch a fever. Don't need it, mother.
I've grown used to it. I know there was no one to look after you. But now I will look after you. Take it. Don't need it, mother. Ali, I've said a dozen times,
don't use my mobile. But you don't listen. I was texting Raaim, mom. See, he sent his dad's picture. He's so cool. Why is papa not like him? Shut up, Ali, with whose permission
did you give Raaim my number? He's my best friend, mama. You won't talk to Raaim again,
return my phone. Why? What is your problem? This is your last warning, I won't tolerate your misbehaviour. Understood. And I don't want Raaim texting me. Okay, I will give him papas. If I can't talk to Raaim
then I will not talk to anyone. Shameem... Hmm? I want to talk to you. Is there a problem? I was thinking of changing Ali's school. Why? It's a good school. Remember how tough it was
getting him enrolled in this school. It's a good school, but I feel he's not in good company. I am not happy. This was bound to happen someday. He's growing up.
He understands things now. Whenever his friends see me with him,
they tease him. He must feel embarrassed. There's no point in changing school. - I should change myself-
- You don't have to change yourself... Ali needs to understand. What does he know about you? I think he'll change
if he's in better company. He'll change. Believe me,
I'm trying to make myself better. To make myself worthy of him. Why? Don't say that. And no need to change. Change is not easy. I know. You won't change, You're better the way you are. Ali was growing apart from Shameem, and closer to Bilal due to Raaim. I didn't know how to tell Shameem. Ali... My child who couldn't
imagine a moment without me, was now beginning to hesitate. I had now become an embarrassment for him. And it wasn't his fault. He had to grow up someday. Fathers are a superhero for their child. And with my personality, I could've never fit his hero image. How could I become his ideal? Papa! Papa! Papa! Come on. Come on, boys. Papa! Come on, boys. Papa!
