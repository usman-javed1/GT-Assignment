Happy Mohammad Jam Mehfil B Sabab Jaam, I had heard the word untouchable, but what happens, I came to know only when everyone came to know that I am also AE positive. Mummy, what happened? Call the tendon, okay, excuse me. The doctor is calling you. I'm sorry, Shamir sahab, we cannot treat him. Please take him somewhere else. Doctor sahab, the doctor from whom we are getting treatment is in this hospital only. I know, sir, you are right.  But we cannot take this risk. We cannot put others in danger for the sake of an HIV patient. Try to understand. Please take him here. Tell me where should I take him. Take him on the road. Mrs. Shamim, I am very impressed by your honesty. After all, you are the star teacher of our school. There is no doubt that, but I think you should not give resignation instead of leave application. When I am fine, I will come back. There is no cure for AIDS. I think you should take the rest of your life in rest and not by lightening yourself. Ma'am, I told you this because you had arranged workshops on HIV. You gave awareness. All these workshops and talks are one thing and real life is another thing. Now, I cannot lighten up the staff, students, their parents like me. You know how this works. Or, it's okay. I resign. Ali will stay here. His reports have come negative. He will not be expelled from the school. Well, it depends on you. Don't tell anything to anyone. This is our school.  It is also a matter of reputation you understand this can I leave now friend thank you Hello Alia yes Alia Shami I forgot my back Death was not as horrific as the attitude of the people seemed horrific that after everyone now even the one has turned his back Come on captain let's go [Music] Team Who will take Ali in his team [Music] [Laughter] Papa what is this? Then heaven forbid AIDS is not such a disease that can be spread by touching, breathing, sharing but whom will we tell this to it has become difficult for our family members to leave the house Doctor please understand the one who is not killed by the disease, people kill him you know if it is treated properly and at the right time, you can survive for 20 to 25 years in AIDS but people make you more of a psychological patient than a physical one Nest me both of you are very depressed give you Doctor Zafar's number for counselling [Music] [Praise] [Music] Go do n't make the kitchen, become mine, go not mine, my Meena what  Will you ever be able to forgive Shamim Bhai [Music] Ummi, can you forgive me? Whether I forgive you or not, you have the right to decide whatever you want. Shami, it's been so many days since we talked to each other properly. We are so lost in our grief that we have stopped understanding each other. How can I forgive you? Give me whatever punishment you want, I won't do that. But I ca n't tolerate your silence. How can I forgive you [Music] when I don't have any complaint against you [Music] Shami, I had died long ago. My second life is a favour given to you by you. So Jai, take it. And then, where will I go after getting angry with you? My every breath is from your mouth. Who else is mine except you? Ali, it's getting late, change your uniform [Praise] Get up, get up child, well done, what is this behavior? Ali, why did you throw water? Yes, I don't want to go to school. Why don't I go to school? Because everyone hates me, I don't have any friends. Everyone says, should you advertise to your mumma and papa? Should you advertise to me too? [Music] Mama, look, look  Ram your friend is watching so what should I do, you won't play with him, he is your friend, I don't have any friends, my father says his mother, father are such people, they are sick, you are sick, parents are sick, my mother and father are very nice, why do you have AIDS, bad people are judged by father, see madam, it is simple, you have to take a decision regarding this matter, otherwise I am going public with this, the decision is completely yours, come on, please Mr. and Mrs. Shamim, I am actually very disinterested, it is becoming difficult day by day, he fights with someone or the other everyday, but you see, Ali is also injured, nobody can see his wounds, everyone is blaming him, ma'am, you think for yourself, that child is becoming irritable because everyone's behaviour is not good with him in the school, so why are you blaming only Ali, such problems keep coming between children, parent pressure  They also give a warning which we handle, but I have to say with great regret that this is not my decision but the decision of the higher management. Ali cannot stay in the school anymore. What are you saying? What has happened? Nothing is so big that you have taken such a big decision. In schools, children often fight among themselves and then they go to sleep. If you say so, then I myself apologize to the parents of that child. The matter is not so small. Everyone has come to know about your illness. [Praise] Look, we also got Ali tested. Ali has nothing. His report is negative and he is absolutely fine. Mrs. Shamim, you will keep arguing and nothing will be achieved. But ma'am, what is the fault of the child? He is fine. I am really sorry for him. I thought that I would sacrifice all the happiness and blessings of the world for Ali. I have become so helpless. [Music] Did you see how I was looking at him? He must have started hating me. It is very difficult for him to hate his parents. Ali would be in pain. How could I explain to them that you people are putting pressure on him because of the school?  No, you are closing the doors of life [Sangeet] He is so young and innocent that he doesn't even know why all this is happening to him He would come running to me with the slightest complaint [Sangeet] Who would he go to at such a young age to see his parents die, to spend the life of an orphan, even thinking this he didn't feel pity We will die, he has his whole life ahead of him We will die, why should I remember him and think about what difficulties he will put me in for so many things I am not afraid of death but I don't want to live for Ali I want to live for Ali I want to live for Mali She is right for Hooli that um parents are just parents, they cannot become God for their children even if they want to Oho why are you doing this, leave it, you need rest, leave it I am strong and healthy, nothing has happened to me and why are you taking trouble for me, don't worry about my pain I like the service of both of you, may Allah not forbid if something happens to you then nothing happens to me, whatever was to happen has happened and you can't do any good work  I don't do it, okay don't be stubborn, give it to me, see, may God forgive me, may he not, my heart gets a lot of peace by serving you both, oh, I get peace by serving, leave the sick clothes, leave them, oh, listen my Fatima, your money will come and ask me, will I answer, I do n't understand, don't do it in the mine, don't agree, your money will be taken away, you just want to tell me this, should I give the clothes here or what are you doing sitting outside in the street, what is this, it is not of use to you, you are standing far away, what do you mean, where did you get so much money from, where did you get it from, what do you mean, I must have my money, what do you mean, what is happening to your money here, where did you get this money from, that salon was there, Shamu had transferred it in my name, I sold it, I sell the salon, some people would have thought that it is so easy for them to sit and lick their favors, I do n't respect anyone in my house and I haven't forgotten the drama you did with me, nor do I remember the one about the child  I am sorry, you are telling me that I will die, I will go anywhere, what do you care and be thankful that you are not going by giving me divorce, I would not be able to show my face to anyone, she is barren and even if she gets divorced, she will not stop meeting these dirty people, she will not stop meeting these dirty people, she will not stop, how does one stop from doing good deeds, father give me food, when someone has been punished, then do not take his punishment on yourself, when will you understand, you will learn to have mercy, father, God has mercy even on those who do not obey his orders, let him be completely, what kind of servant of God are you, who do not love God's creatures, you know, I do not understand this matter of mercy and love, and who is spoiling your mind, the same God's punishment has come upon him, there is no trace of his touch, this is the punishment, asthaghfar asth, if everyone has become like you, father, then lock up the orphan children in orphanage, no one should pick up the unclaimed dead bodies lying on the road saying whether they were good or bad  Were you a Momin or a Kafir, nonsense will be told, nonsense will be told, why don't you explain this to yourself? You think yourself very intelligent, don't you? If you get infected with this disease in the course of serving them, then no one will even marry you. Forget about marriage, they do n't even look at your own body. They don't think about me at least think about yourself. You want to be like them. You want to be like them. You cut the fruit of the womb, I should know something. The Quran is left for these very works. Whoever you are, you ask, is there any evil in it, and how many should I get guidance. I should know something. I am feeling restless thinking about Ali, he is so dear to his father, who will raise his head, both the parents are so shy, Rukhsana, stop it, the child, the child has eaten up our heads, but I wo n't take it, I don't think about my daughter, what kind of relationship will it be, will it happen? I am going mad thinking this, I don't even know, my son should take it out of his mind, he is not a woman, come on, my son will go to hell.  She will ruin the whole house, Satyana will ruin the whole house, what is the fault of Meena aunty in this, she too can do this much, I should keep quiet, but she is lying, listen whatever has happened, you have told her, your actions, your deeds, I have refused, you have ruined your life, Shami uncle was the first to know about AIDS, then you told Meena aunty to him, you did not refuse, you rude, shut up, you have no shame, I have no shame, don't tell me, my Shamim is not noble, my son, the bad woman said what, but she said what, but Abdullah is saying the right thing, your husband is a criminal, he is also supporting her, he is also going to hell, Shamim uncle had disobeyed anything, why did he get such a disease, Fatima talks like this to Naano, you all are not from the house itself, but it does not make any difference, I swear by God, until the whole world turns against him They are standing with each other, isn't it? God is also standing with them [Music] What has happened to him? He has to go to school. He cannot die. We have understood. Who should explain it to him? I thought only animals are found in Madrasas. Here, the entire city is filled with animals. The teachers who never got tired of kissing him, today do not have the courage to make him sit with them. You must get very angry, don't you? People's attitude, but fate. If you ask the truth, you would hear that he does not even realize his own pain. If he is worried about me, then what was to happen has happened. What will happen to him? Move aside, move aside. What are you doing? Don't hold your hand, I am saying, don't move your hand, get up, you will get hurt. Get up, give up your life. What else do you want to do? For God's sake, leave this chase behind. My son, you have eaten me up. I am saying, move aside, it will hurt me. What can I do? You are nothing. One, this sister is helping you. On top of that, there is no need for you to help me. I am saying, I am hitting you, right?  I will not be able to give a drop of water, take it away, leave it, no, no, leave it, what could I have done, there was no need to sympathize with them, you sympathized with me, you did not sympathize with me, you deliberately wore it in front of me, so that my heart does not rot, take it away, at least take it away, I am going, sister, you just get up, for God's sake, sister, what would I do, that sick woman, what would she understand, what would she understand, the disease that she has got, she has happened because of me, she got ad because of me, still she is standing with me, despite all the hatred and being innocent, do you know why, so that you do not get hurt, she, her face, I have ruined her life, your own son heard it, get rid of it, leave it [Music] [ Music] [Praise] [ Music] Dil lagi phool jaani padega Dil lagi l jaani padega Dil lagi ul jaani badegi zindagi ul jaani padega [Music]
