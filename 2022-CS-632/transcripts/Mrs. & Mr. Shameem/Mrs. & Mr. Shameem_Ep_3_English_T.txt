[112.92] Bay ji.
[114.20] Yes?  Oh wonderful, Umaina's here.
[120.12] You forgot all about us after Salma left.
[122.20] Never showed us your face again.
[124.76] This isn't right.
[126.64] Bay ji, Umaina's having her vacation.
[130.64] She was going home.
[132.40] I said to her, why go home so soon?
[136.40] Stay with us for a couple of days.
[138.64] And I dragged her here with me.  It
[140.52] doesn't matter if you dragged
her here, son.
[143.28] Let her stay with us for a couple of days.
[145.24] It's okay.
[146.52] Go to your room.  Get some rest.
[148.28] I told you.
[151.20] Go on.
[153.12] Yes, go on.
[160.44] She can manage
[164.84] I controlled myself in front of you,
understood.
[167.64] You know how
your sister's husband will react.
[170.04] He will want our heads.
[171.96] Why did you bring her here?
[172.96] Is she in some kind of trouble?
[174.84] No, no trouble at all, Bay ji.
Don't worry.
[179.84] - Look Shammo...
- Bay ji.
[211.60] What misbehavior is this?
[212.64] It's you, Umaina.  I thought it was Humaira.
[215.48] Why would Humaira be here?
[216.76] That's right.  Why would she be here?
[218.68] Who wants to go sleep
in their own room right now?
[221.84] I'll sleep here instead.  Come on.
[223.16] Keep your hands to yourself,
or I'll chop them off!
[225.64] This isn't fair.
[226.76] Am I not your type?
[228.56] I know everything about you.
[230.00] Hell won't break loose
if you sleep with me tonight...
[232.88] Shut up!
[234.08] Leave quietly,
or else I'll raise a commotion!
[237.24] Okay, fine.  I'm leaving.
[239.68] This is my home,
and you can't lay a finger on me here.
[243.96] You think if you complain to Bay ji,
[245.36] she will chuck me out of the house!
[247.12] She won't destroy her daughter's
life for the likes of you!
[251.52] I only came over to give you sympathy.
[255.04] But you don't want my sympathy.
[257.80] You deserve that eunuch.  He's fit for you.
[273.28] Tell Bay ji to throw her out of the house.
[275.32] She is already hitting on me.
[333.84] Have you lost your mind?
[334.84] What are you doing?
[336.84] - Let go.
- No.
[337.84] Leave it!  Leave it, you dog!
[339.96] - Leave it!
- Have you lost your mind?
[342.12] Let me die!
[343.80] Leave it!
[344.64] I won't!
[353.28] At least let me die!
[357.08] Give it back.  Please.
[395.20] Drink some water.
[400.64] Shameem, what have I done to myself?
[407.08] I have lost my worth.
[416.44] Don't worry.  I will deal with him.
[421.08] How many will you deal with?
[423.64] How many more times
will you get beaten up?
[426.16] Let me go.
[428.68] Let me go.
[429.44] No, where will you go?
[433.24] Hmm?
[438.04] I'll do anything.
[441.32] I'll become a [ __ ] if I have to,
[443.48] but I won't be a burden on anyone.
[446.96] No!
[457.32] Can I suggest something if you don't mind?
[465.08] Go ahead and say it.
[467.80] Abuse me if you like.
[472.20] I won't mind anything anymore.
[475.52] Nothing.
[476.36] Ask.
[479.80] What is it?
Go ahead.  Ask.
[483.96] Will you marry me?
[503.60] What's wrong?
Why is everyone looking so stunned?
[508.08] What did I say?
[511.96] I've decided to marry Umi.
[530.32] What's so funny?
[532.84] It's not a joke.  I am pretty serious.
[536.72] "It's not a joke. I'm pretty serious!"
[538.84] I think she has far better choices.
[541.28] You tell him, brother.
[543.60] Did we come here to listen to this joke,
[546.40] leaving our important work?
[549.72] Come on, we've got better things to do.
[552.80] Disgusting.
[556.68] - You're impossible.
- Wait, Rukshana...
[560.64] Let's go.  The joke's over.
[565.84] Choti.  Choti.
[570.84] What?
[599.76] I know you haven't eaten
anything since morning.
[603.24] So I thought I'll
get you something to eat.
[608.08] And we can eat together.
[614.64] Come on, eat.
[617.04] Come on.
[617.92] And yes, I've spoken with the family.
[623.40] What are you doing?
[624.36] What am I doing?
[625.52] What are you doing with me?
[627.44] The rest of you.
[628.56] Everyone's made a spectacle of me.
[629.96] Did someone say something?
[631.12] Yes.  I've been insulted.
[632.80] - Who?
- You've insulted me!
[634.28] I insulted you?
[635.16] Yes.  What else will you call it?
[637.88] Bilal's turned me into a pile of trash!
[639.96] My father threw me out of the house,
[641.20] thinking I'm a piece of trash!
And now you...
[644.68] Umi!
[646.08] Stay away!
[651.80] - I don't know... -
I told Bilal you're unmanly.
[654.44] I told my father you're unmanly.
[656.60] You're his punishment.  A punishment!
[663.92] If you felt offended...
[666.32] - I was just...
- I was what?
[668.44] Who do you think you are?
[669.52] Have you ever seen yourself in the mirror?
[671.16] You can't even stand straight.
[674.24] And you want to marry Umaina.
[676.00] Umaina may be helpless,
[677.12] but not helpless enough to marry you!
[682.40] You Shameem...
[688.56] What a joke!
[692.36] - I did it for your sake... -
I'm leaving.
[695.12] Leave me!
[696.84] Don't touch me!
[698.24] Look, for my sake...
[700.32] You don't have to marry
me if you don't want to, - Leave
[702.80] me.
- I'll tell everyone.
[706.76] But take pity on your
condition for God's sake.
[710.56] Don't do this.
[712.24] I am feeling dizzy, leave me.
[716.08] Umi.
[717.44] Umi.
[718.56] Go away!
[720.72] I will kill myself!  Leave!
[732.84] Umi?
[758.08] So you want to marry Umaina.
[768.08] Have you ever seen yourself in the mirror?
[771.96] Always flailing like a flag.
[775.96] To qualify for marriage,
[778.80] you need to pop a rod, which
[782.44] you haven't got.
[790.92] Let's imagine...
[798.56] Let's imagine Umaina agrees to marry you.
[804.68] Then she must have
a real solid reason for it.
[810.20] Maybe she's in some kind of a mess.
[814.88] Or a ruse.
[818.52] Don't do it.  You'll be embarrassed.
[822.28] As per my experience,
[825.48] women like her need a man!
[829.92] Solid!
[832.80] Not your case.
[835.80] Listen to me and don't do it.
[839.52] Otherwise,
you'll come running to me for advice,
[844.24] The rest is your choice.
[848.68] Come, let's take a few puffs.
[852.56] That's all you are capable of.
[858.60] Come that way.
[860.04] Bay ji's room is on this side.
[861.56] She raises quite a commotion
if her room fills up with smoke.
[864.04] Come on.
[880.60] Bay ji, please do
something about this girl.
[885.24] Something isn't right.
[887.44] Umaina isn't wandering from
pillar to post without a reason.
[891.24] Listen to me and save
your son from this girl.
[895.60] God bless him.
[901.16] Call Salma.
[904.96] Okay.
[924.00] Salma, you know everything.
[926.60] He isn't listening to me.
Help me out here.
[929.08] Talk to brother Aamir.
[930.56] Bilal is his childhood friend.
[932.00] He will definitely listen to him.
[936.24] Forget about Bilal permanently.
For your own sake.
[942.44] You're saying this.
[946.24] Forget him?
[949.72] That's it.
[951.84] And everything will be back to normal.
[955.20] What all do you want me to forget?
[958.88] My past?  My memories?
[962.56] Or my future?
[965.72] Umi, what have you done?
[970.28] You tell me what do I do?
[980.24] What's done is done,
[983.16] but now I'm scared for myself.
[985.64] Scared?  You?
[988.36] Yes.  Everyone knows we're best friends.
[993.12] What will they think if they find out?
[995.96] And Aamir...
[1002.80] I cannot afford this humiliation.
[1006.20] I cannot put my marriage
at stake for you, Umi.
[1009.08] - Salma?
- Salma what?
[1012.52] Did you ask before doing this?
[1015.00] And now you've sought
refuge in my own home.
[1018.68] What am I going to tell Bay ji?
Why are you here?
[1022.00] I didn't want to come.
[1023.60] - Shameem brought me here.
- Shameem...
[1025.52] Shameem is naive.
[1027.88] He's doing favors because
he's decent and kind-hearted.
[1031.96] How long can he keep you here?
[1036.36] Go back.
[1038.28] Get an abortion.
[1042.20] It's too late now.
[1045.00] Not possible now.
[1051.52] Apologize to your family.
[1054.88] Everything will be fine.
[1057.40] I won't tell anyone about your pregnancy.
[1061.48] I'll tell them that you had a
fight with your parents.
[1065.92] Just leave.
[1071.08] You've grown very
mature after the wedding.
[1115.04] You'll die.  What are you doing?
[1117.64] - Leave me.
- I can't let you die.
[1119.12] - Leave me.
- Come on!
[1120.28] Leave me, you disgusting man!
[1123.40] Come on, Umi.
[1126.04] I'm disgusting and
everyone else is decent.
[1128.92] Kisses and hugs for everyone but not me.
[1132.20] Isn't this unfair?
[1134.48] What will you get from Shammo?
[1136.52] Squat!  Which he hasn't got either?
[1140.52] If it's something you
want then ask a real man!
[1143.04] I will kill you.
[1144.84] Stay back, you dog.
[1145.96] I will kill you!
Stay back!
[1147.96] Stay back!
[1148.76] - Have you lost your mind?
- Stay back!
[1150.44] Have you lost your mind?
[1151.96] This is for your own good.
[1153.28] Stop hitting me.
[1154.80] You deserve this.
[1156.44] Everyone's had their share of fun,
[1158.24] and now it's my turn.
[1159.76] I was saying...
[1180.56] What are you staring at?
[1182.84] She was going to commit suicide!
[1184.52] She claims she will die
if she doesn't marry Shammo.
[1187.12] This would have led to a police case.
[1189.24] I've just saved the family's honor.
[1191.76] And you're staring at me!
[1203.76] And I've warned you before not to
follow me around like a spying cat.
[1208.44] I'll divorce you if I get angry.
[1213.16] It won't take me a minute.
[1342.24] Stop.  Stop.  Stop.
[1347.84] Who are you?
[1348.92] - Leave my bag.
- Let go.
[1350.28] - Leave my bag.
- Let go.
[1351.56] Anybody there?
[1352.84] Leave my bag.  My money's in it.
[1355.20] Let go.
[1356.40] Let's go.  Let's go.
[1377.88] Umi.
[1380.52] Umi.
[1383.52] Umi.
[1391.64] Bay ji...
[1393.72] Bay ji, where is Umi?
[1397.44] She must be somewhere around.
[1399.40] Umi.
[1400.88] Umi.
[1401.56] Don't make a commotion.
You'll wake everyone up.
[1406.44] Did you see her leave, Bay ji?
[1414.08] Let her go if she's gone.
[1417.00] Leave her alone.
[1419.20] How can I let her go?
[1422.56] I can't let her go.
[1424.08] - Umi.
- Wait, son.
[1426.40] - Shammo, don't...
- Umi.
[1432.04] Oh God!
[1491.36] What's wrong?
[1493.40] Who did this to you?
[1496.12] Everyone.
[1499.44] They all did.
[1506.44] Except for you.
[1510.72] Why are you so good to me?
[1515.28] What do you want from me?
[1518.84] What do you want?
[1521.48] Enough, Umi.  Enough!
[1525.56] Enough.
[1527.44] Enough.
[1568.20] Nice.
[1570.20] I am totally floored, sweetheart.
[1573.72] Check for yourself.  How are you looking?
[1576.04] Although there's a long
queue of beauties waiting outside,
[1578.00] you can give them a run for their money,
sweetheart.
[1580.64] Come on.
[1581.28] Wonderful.  Wait.
[1582.72] I didn't lend you my face so
you could put it on display for the world.
[1586.80] Only for you to practice your makeup.
[1588.48] Hurry up.  Mom's got several
chores lined up for me.
[1591.24] God, beauty with attitude.  I
[1593.08] can't control myself, sweetheart.
[1595.84] Look at his attitude.
[1598.32] Check the liner.
[1600.36] Doesn't it look nice?
[1601.48] How many times have I said
eyeshadow has to be applied first.
[1605.56] And you call this eyeliner?
[1606.88] - Looks good.
- Leave it.
[1609.72] What happened?
[1610.32] You should take up
wrestling or bullfighting,
[1612.40] these feminine jobs don't suit you.
[1613.96] Do manly jobs suit you, Chammiya?
[1616.96] - Do you?
- What's wrong?
[1619.16] Here's a question,
and I want an honest answer.
[1622.04] Do you have desires?
[1625.28] Tell me.
[1626.28] What desire?
[1627.68] Those desires.
[1629.96] Do you feel anything?
[1631.72] Yes, I do.  Are we not humans?
[1634.64] Swear on me?
[1636.96] - Tell me.
- I swear.
[1638.92] So what do you do?
[1641.76] That's strange.
[1643.64] Tell me what you do.
[1645.16] Move.
[1646.44] Tell me what you do.
[1648.16] Come on, tell me what you do?
[1649.40] What is there to do?
[1650.88] Whoever inspires that feeling in me,
[1653.84] I don't take my eyes off her.
[1655.48] Amazing.
You stole the show.
[1659.60] So who inspires that feeling inside you?
[1662.76] Tell me who?
[1665.28] Don't hide from me.
[1666.56] You!
[1667.44] You inspire feelings inside me.
[1672.44] Come here, baby.  Come on.
[1677.44] But I am not a lesbian.
You've no luck with me.
[1681.48] I'll find a macho man like Bilal for you.
[1684.96] Leave me.
[1686.32] - I'm sure you're all smiling inside.
- Have you lost your mind?
[1693.60] Oh my my.
[1695.56] What a guy!
[1697.96] Came straight from heaven.
[1703.60] Angels live in heaven, not jinns.
[1707.40] Why are you jealous of my prince charming?
[1710.84] Go find someone for yourself at the gym.
[1713.92] You'll find someone.
[1717.80] I don't want to.
[1722.84] Jealous...
[1726.20] There is a woman inside you.
[1729.84] I was wondering,
[1731.40] there's a book called Men are
from Mars and Women are from Venus.
[1735.24] So what planet are you guys from?
[1739.68] What do you mean by 'you guys'?
[1741.64] You know what I mean. We
[1744.40] 're from right here. This land.
[1746.40] We're the true inhibitors of this planet.
[1750.00] These layers of manliness
which you guys wear,
[1757.00] we don't need it.
[1758.40] We are what we are.
[1760.84] Bravo. Bravo. What a
[1763.96] speech Mother India! Bravo
[1766.08] .
[1768.44] You sound like Julie, advocating for men.
[1771.60] But Julie, you don't have biceps like him.
[1776.12] I'm floored on his biceps.
[1786.12] Come on. Leave
[1792.68] me. Shameem
[1803.44] !
[1814.68] What happened? All okay?
[1820.72] Huh?
[1847.16] I'm taking her to the doctor's Bay ji. Careful
[1851.12] . "
[1856.16] I am doomed, the end is here."
[1864.80] Are you watching this spectacle,
brother-in-law?
[1869.00] They are enjoying their life.
[1873.60] Don't you see someone older standing here?
[1875.52] Get up, show some manners.
[1877.88] Go make some tea for me as well. Shammo
[1898.92] , we've to go today evening.
[1901.32] Remember. Go
[1902.44] where?
[1909.72] You don't remember a
thing since she arrived.
[1912.76] It's Friday night, remember.
[1915.20] We go  to the shrine every Friday night.
[1918.92] Okay, fine. Listen
[1921.12] , can we take Umi along too?
She isn't well.
[1933.20] - Hmm? -
Okay. Rukshana Rukshana
[2077.16] What took you so long?
[2077.96] I was looking for a clean one.
[2083.04] Is this washed?
[2086.00] It still stinks!
[2088.12] Maybe it wasn't washed properly.
[2089.08] I'll get you another one.
[2089.92] Get my prayer mat.  It
[2094.60] doesn't matter how hard
you scrub on the surface.
[2097.28] The dirt is on the inside.
[2098.56] Unless the heart is cleansed,
nothing will ever be right.
[2102.24] Can I get you a clean towel,
brother Abdullah?
[2106.16] Clean your own filth first.
Don't worry about me.
[2109.40] This house didn't lack freaks,
[2112.08] that you brought one more.
[2113.96] Brother Abdullah!
[2116.76] You can say whatever you want to me.
[2118.84] But you have no right to talk about Umi.
[2123.16] Why?
[2124.40] Why can't I talk about her?
[2125.80] No decent woman stays
for so long in another's home.
[2129.56] That iniquitous woman...
[2130.48] Brother Abdullah!
[2132.48] Hey!
[2133.32] Look, he is glaring at me.
[2136.64] You know his nature.
[2139.48] - How can you... -
Why is he saying such things about Umi?
[2142.12] Umi.  Umi.  Umi.
[2143.64] You're worried about Umi,
[2146.48] and not your family.
[2149.16] Look....there are people
here to look after you.
[2153.20] But she's got only me.
[2155.04] What are you two blabbering about?
[2157.44] Are you calling me names?
[2159.24] Are you calling me names?
[2160.72] I was only telling
him to apologize to you.
[2164.24] Apologize.
[2165.88] Come on.
[2167.48] Come on, apologies.
[2173.00] Sorry.
[2174.24] What's wrong?
[2175.76] He won't mend his ways that easily.
[2178.24] Today he dared to glare at me,
because of that [ __ ].
[2180.76] Who knows,
tomorrow he might even strangle me.
[2182.80] We cannot accept such iniquitous
and evil deeds here,
[2185.00] Mr.  Shameem.
[2187.80] My daughter often comes here.
This is not accepted.
[2191.00] Understood.
[2191.92] This is not accepted.  Hey there
[2192.84] !
[2194.76] I want you to throw her
out of this house, Bay ji!
[2197.44] Okay, son.  Why are you getting furious?
[2200.08] Umaina will leave eventually.
[2201.44] Don't ruin your health over her.
Sit down.
[2203.40] Sir, we need to get rid of
the root cause of the problem.
[2206.04] I'm telling you.  Throw her out!
[2208.40] Okay, fine.  Let's do that.
[2210.72] Shammo...
[2211.92] Your mother is begging you.
[2215.56] Have mercy on me.
[2217.20] She had left.  Why did you bring her back?
[2219.92] It's just our family now.
[2221.40] When the entire neighborhood
starts making a commotion,
[2223.32] then what are you going to say?
[2224.44] Where do I take her?  Where will she go?
[2226.00] Let her go to hell for all I care!
[2228.84] I cannot ruin my family for her sake!
[2232.52] Try to understand.
[2234.72] Even she has some reasons.
How can I not help her?
[2239.28] And anyway, she is not a guest here.
[2242.04] This is my house.
[2243.96] Fine, then you can keep her.
[2245.96] You can keep her too.
[2247.84] I'll divorce your sister if you like.
[2249.88] - Should I?
- No.
[2251.40] - Should I?
- No.
[2253.36] I'll divorce your sister if you like.
[2255.00] Fine, do it!
[2262.44] What?
[2264.00] Divorce her.  Right now.
[2265.96] Shameem.
[2266.64] What are you saying, Shammo?
[2267.96] What are you saying?
Are you in your senses?
[2269.52] See Rukshana, your brother
doesn't want you to settle down.
[2272.56] Great.
[2273.92] First, you threaten to divorce her,
and now you sympathize with her.
[2276.32] Why are you telling her?
[2277.64] Divorce her.
[2278.64] Divorce her right now.
[2280.20] Why don't you?
[2281.12] I won't divorce her!
[2283.24] You can't force me.
[2284.36] What can you do?  Tell me.
[2286.12] I only respect you because
you're my brother-in-law.
[2287.64] Quiet.
[2288.40] Otherwise,
I won't let you stay here for a minute.
[2293.44] And stop torturing her!
[2295.84] She hasn't harmed anyone!
[2298.52] Umi won't go anywhere.
She will stay right here.
[2301.52] And yes, I am marrying her.
[2305.32] You can do whatever you want.
[2314.68] I am so unlucky.
[2317.12] I got a ruthless husband,
[2318.48] but even my own family turned against me.
[2322.52] Brother Abdullah didn't divorce
Rukhsana because of their child.
[2325.64] I don't even have any children.
[2327.36] Now you decide, Bay ji.
[2329.48] Do you value your
daughters more or your son?
[2331.88] And also decide, Bay ji,
[2333.40] either he can leave with her,
or we'll leave.
[2336.04] I still find it funny
that Shameem's getting married-
[2339.08] Shut up!
[2344.60] What is your problem, huh?
[2347.76] If my son likes someone
then what's your problem?
[2352.76] What?
[2354.08] Bay ji?
[2355.28] What are you saying, Bay ji?
[2357.12] Why can't I say so?
[2359.36] Am I not a mother?  I'm his mother too.
[2363.88] Don't I want to see
my son get married too?
[2369.24] To see him decked out as a groom.
[2376.08] Recently I had lost all hope.
[2380.92] If Shammo likes someone,
what is your problem?
[2385.84] Even we have some dreams for him.
[2388.96] He's our brother too.
[2390.96] But he's marrying that b****
[2393.88] - She has...
- Enough!
[2397.84] Shameless, these words don't suit you!
[2405.36] Even we saw your husband's
respectable family.
[2408.88] We had ensured he is
from a good background.
[2411.40] But what did he turn out to be?
[2413.40] He is good for nothing.
[2415.40] How did we benefit, huh?
[2416.64] How did his prayers help, huh?
What did we gain?
[2418.72] She's quick at pointing fingers at others.
[2422.56] Shameless
[2427.08] And you?
[2429.48] Humaira, you?
[2432.92] Your prayers are never answered,
[2436.96] because of your husband.
[2441.76] He's a lowlife.
[2447.76] And this little panda.
[2450.44] Sit up.  Come on.
[2452.96] Shameless, little runt.
[2457.08] How much does he care about you?
[2458.64] "Bay ji, don't scold her,
don't yell at her."
[2460.40] "Don't hurt her."
But you...
[2463.92] You were laughing at him, you twit.
[2469.36] Aren't you all ashamed?
[2472.52] I will stand by my son.
[2476.60] Me...
[2477.52] I'll see who stops me.
[2481.56] He'll marry anyone he wants.
[2484.20] God willing,
[2485.04] I will personally arrange his wedding.
[2496.04] Bay ji, I don't want any of this.
[2498.20] - I am ashamed of...
- Quiet.
