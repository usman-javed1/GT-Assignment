[711.80] time when you will get caught in the grip of his wrath
[715.28] and all this  Break the relationship or else you will
[718.56] become unlucky,
[721.16] I had heard that God forgives but
[725.20] people do not forgive,
[729.92] but maybe even God did not forgive me,
[735.60] or I was cursed by Abdullah Bhai,
[740.64] but I also prayed a lot, did
[745.12] God not listen to even one of those prayers,
[752.36] or does God only listen to curses? Will you
[799.96] leave that God when you
[802.32] need him the most?
[805.16] Where have I left God,
[811.60] maybe God left me, oh,
[823.16] tie up all the monkeys, come on,
[832.16] Shahrukh Khan, what
[836.00] happened, why are you throwing tantrums, get out of here, what are you
[838.72] angry about, and if I love you,
[842.24] you have

[885.76] mood. Get out of here right now. Make a

[903.92] please don't be
[963.56] afraid. Nami danam [Music] Manzil mad. One by one, all the people from the neighbourhood, the relatives gave [Music] Not only with me, but with my entire family, God himself brought my gathering inside. Happy Mohammad Jam Mehfil B Sabab Jaam, I had heard the word untouchable,
[968.68] but what happens, I came to know only
[987.92] when everyone came to know
[993.68] that I am also AE positive.
[1038.32] Mummy, what happened?
[1051.92] Call the tendon,
[1053.52] okay, excuse me. The doctor is calling you. I'm sorry,
[1060.48] Shamir sahab, we cannot treat him.
[1064.60] Please take him somewhere else.
[1068.52] Doctor sahab, the doctor from whom we are getting treatment is
[1070.72] in this hospital only. I know,
[1072.52] sir, you are right.  But we
[1075.20] cannot take this risk. We
[1077.64] cannot put others in danger for the sake of an HIV patient.
[1079.28] Try to understand. Please take him here.
[1081.96] Tell me where should I take him.
[1086.96] Take him on the road. Mrs. Shamim, I am
[1091.28] very impressed by your honesty.
[1094.16] After all, you are the star teacher of our
[1098.16] school. There is no doubt that, but I
[1102.92] think you should not give resignation instead of leave application.
[1108.76] When I am
[1112.44] fine, I will come back. There is
[1119.24] no cure for AIDS. I think you should take the rest of your
[1122.52] life in rest and not by
[1125.52] lightening yourself. Ma'am, I
[1129.00] told you this because you had
[1131.80] arranged workshops on HIV. You gave awareness.
[1135.56] All these workshops and talks are one thing and
[1139.76] real life is another thing. Now, I cannot lighten up the staff,
[1144.60] students, their parents
[1147.20] like me. You know how this works.
[1160.04] Or, it's okay. I
[1163.08] resign.
[1166.92] Ali will stay here. His reports have come
[1170.08] negative. He will not be expelled from the school.
[1171.96] Well, it
[1174.76] depends on you. Don't tell anything to anyone.
[1179.00] This is our school.  It is also a matter of reputation
[1182.52] you understand this can I
[1190.04] leave now
[1192.88] friend thank you
[1202.92] Hello Alia yes Alia
[1207.60] Shami I forgot my
[1212.28] back Death was not as horrific as the attitude of the people
[1221.96] seemed horrific that after everyone now

[1280.83] [Laughter]
[1286.96] Papa what is this? Then heaven
[1292.52] forbid AIDS is not such a disease that can be spread by touching,
[1295.56] breathing, sharing
[1301.12] but whom will we tell this to it has become
[1308.32] difficult for our family members to leave the house
[1310.60] Doctor please
[1313.40] understand the one who is not killed by the disease,
[1316.64] people kill him
[1319.44] you know if it is treated properly and at the right time,
[1321.44] you can survive for 20 to 25 years in AIDS
[1325.72] but people make you more of a psychological patient than a physical one Nest
[1338.20] me both of you are very
[1343.20] depressed

[1454.32] Meena what  Will you ever be able to forgive Shamim Bhai
[1458.79] [Music]
[1469.64] Ummi, can you forgive me? Whether
[1472.60] I forgive you or
[1475.64] not, you have the right to decide whatever you want. Shami, it's been so many
[1479.80] days since we
[1481.12] talked to each other properly.
[1484.20] We are so lost in our grief
[1487.60] that we have stopped understanding each other. How can I
[1491.28] forgive you?
[1499.68] Give me whatever punishment you want, I won't do that.
[1505.44] But I ca
[1507.76] n't tolerate your silence.
[1512.40] How can I forgive you
[1515.17] [Music]
[1517.00] when I don't have any complaint against you
[1521.39] [Music]
[1525.48] Shami, I had died long ago.
[1530.60] My second life is a favour given to you by you.
[1532.52] So Jai, take it.
[1536.52] And then, where will I
[1542.08] go after getting angry with you? My every breath is from your mouth.
[1547.80] Who else is mine except you?
[1565.80] Ali, it's getting late, change your uniform
[1571.22] [Praise]
[1572.40] Get up, get up
[1575.32] child, well
[1577.80] done, what is this behavior? Ali, why did
[1580.96] you throw water? Yes, I don't want to go to school.
[1583.84] Why don't I go to school? Because everyone
[1585.52] hates me, I don't have any friends. Everyone
[1587.56] says, should you advertise to your mumma and papa? Should you advertise to
[1589.64] me too?
[1593.46] [Music]
[1606.48] Mama, look, look  Ram your friend is watching
[1609.96] so what should I do, you won't play with him, he is
[1613.52] your friend, I don't have any friends,
[1616.04] my father says his mother, father are such people, they are sick, you are sick,
[1618.80] parents are sick, my
[1622.08] mother and father are very nice,
[1624.60] why do you have AIDS, bad people are judged by father,
[1629.24] see madam, it is simple, you have to
[1634.00] take a decision regarding this matter, otherwise I am
[1636.16] going public with this, the decision is completely yours, come on,
[1659.32] please Mr. and Mrs. Shamim, I am
[1663.20] actually very disinterested, it is becoming
[1671.80] difficult day by day, he
[1675.68] fights with someone or the other everyday, but
[1678.32] you see, Ali is also injured, nobody can
[1680.52] see his wounds, everyone is
[1682.84] blaming him, ma'am, you think for yourself, that
[1686.16] child is becoming irritable because
[1687.88] everyone's behaviour is not good with him in the school,
[1689.68] so why are you blaming only Ali, such
[1695.40] problems keep coming between children, parent pressure  They
[1698.24] also give a warning which we handle,
[1701.16] but I have to say with great regret that
[1705.00] this is not my decision but the decision of the higher management.
[1709.40] Ali cannot stay in the school anymore. What are
[1712.64] you saying? What has happened? Nothing is
[1716.16] so big that you have taken such a
[1717.76] big decision. In schools,
[1721.08] children often fight among themselves and then they go to sleep.
[1723.88] If you say so, then I myself apologize to the
[1728.16] parents of that child. The matter is
[1730.92] not so small.
[1732.60] Everyone has come to know about your illness.
[1738.12] [Praise]
[1743.40] Look, we also got Ali tested.
[1745.44] Ali has nothing. His report is negative and he is
[1748.16] absolutely fine. Mrs. Shamim, you will
[1752.60] keep arguing and nothing will be achieved. But
[1756.00] ma'am, what is the fault of the child? He is fine. I am
[1757.96] really sorry for him. I
[1774.40] thought that I would sacrifice
[1778.80] all the happiness and blessings of the world for Ali. I have become so
[1789.52] helpless.
[1794.00] [Music] Did
[1798.56] you
[1801.36] see how I was looking at him? He must have started
[1806.12] hating
[1810.44] me. It is very difficult for him to hate his parents.
[1815.60] Ali would be in pain.
[1821.92] How could I explain to them
[1828.44] that you people are putting pressure on him because of the school?  No, you are
[1832.76] closing the doors of life
[1834.54] [Sangeet] He
[1836.04] is so young and innocent that he doesn't even know
[1839.28] why all this is happening to him He would come
[1842.64] running to me with the slightest complaint
[1846.96] [Sangeet]
[1853.20] Who would he go to at
[1858.76] such a young age to
[1864.48] see his parents die, to spend the life of an orphan,
[1870.48] even thinking this he didn't feel pity
[1877.16] We will die, he has his
[1881.36] whole life ahead of him
[1889.24] We will die, why should I remember him and
[1892.84] think about what difficulties he will
[1905.76] put me in for so many things I am not afraid of death
[1909.32] but I don't want to live for Ali I
[1912.60] want to live for Ali I want to
[1918.16] live for Mali She is
[1927.80] right for Hooli that
[1934.20] um parents are
[1937.28] just parents, they
[1944.20] cannot become God for their children even if they want to Oho
[1950.12] why are you doing this, leave it, you
[1953.00] need rest, leave it I am strong and healthy,
[1954.80] nothing has happened to me and
[1956.44] why are you taking trouble for me, don't worry about my pain
[1958.16] I like the
[1959.80] service of both of you, may Allah not forbid if something happens to you then nothing happens to me, whatever was to happen has happened and you can't do
[1964.08] any good work  I don't do it,
[1966.28] okay don't be stubborn, give it to me, see, may
[1968.08] God forgive me, may he not, my
[1970.60] heart gets a lot of peace by serving you both, oh, I get peace by serving, leave the
[1973.40] sick
[1975.40] clothes, leave them, oh, listen my Fatima, your money will come and
[1979.20] ask me, will I answer, I do
[1982.20] n't understand, don't do it in the mine, don't agree,
[1985.84] your money will be taken away, you
[1990.52] just want to tell me this, should I give the clothes here
[1992.64] or what are you doing sitting outside in the street, what is
[2022.72] this, it is not of use to you, you are standing
[2027.12] far away, what do you mean,
[2030.72] where did you get so much money from, where did you get it from, what do you
[2035.84] mean, I must have my money, what do you mean, what is happening to your money
[2038.04] here, where did you get
[2040.76] this money from, that salon was there, Shamu had transferred it in my name, I
[2044.16] sold it, I sell the salon,
[2049.44] some people would have thought that it is so easy for them to
[2053.32] sit and lick their favors, I do
[2055.72] n't respect anyone in my house
[2058.00] and I haven't forgotten the
[2060.56] drama you did with me, nor do I remember the one about the child  I am sorry,
[2065.24] you are telling me that I will
[2069.64] die, I will go anywhere, what do you care and be thankful that
[2072.44] you are not going by giving me divorce, I would not be
[2075.32] able to show my face to anyone, she is barren and
[2077.72] even if she gets divorced, she will not stop
[2087.40] meeting these dirty people, she will not stop meeting these dirty people, she will not stop,
[2093.12] how does one stop from doing good deeds,
[2096.60] father
[2099.76] give me food, when someone has been punished, then do
[2103.20] not take his punishment on yourself, when will you understand,
[2105.36] you will learn to have mercy, father, God has mercy even on those who do not
[2111.48] obey his orders, let him be completely, what kind of servant of God are you, who do
[2115.28] not love God's creatures,
[2117.56] you know, I do not understand this matter of mercy and love,
[2121.04] and who is spoiling your mind, the same
[2123.60] God's punishment has come upon him, there is no trace of his
[2128.28] touch,
[2131.52] this is the punishment, asthaghfar asth, if everyone has become like you,
[2135.28] father, then lock up the orphan children
[2138.04] in orphanage, no
[2140.92] one should pick up the unclaimed dead bodies lying on the road saying whether
[2142.88] they were good or bad  Were you a Momin or a Kafir, nonsense will be told,
[2146.44] nonsense will be told, why don't you explain this to yourself?
[2150.72] You think yourself very intelligent, don't you?
[2153.96] If you get infected with this disease in the course of serving them, then no
[2155.76] one will even marry you. Forget about marriage, they do
[2158.16] n't even look at your own body. They don't
[2162.72] think about me at least think about yourself. You want to be like them. You
[2167.68] want to be like them.
[2170.04] You
[2183.04] cut the fruit of the womb, I should know something. The
[2187.60] Quran is left for these very works. Whoever
[2190.32] you are, you ask, is there any evil in it, and
[2195.24] how many should I get guidance. I should know something. I am feeling restless
[2197.44] thinking about Ali, he is
[2200.20] so dear to his father,
[2204.28] who will raise his head,
[2208.52] both the parents are so shy, Rukhsana, stop it, the child, the
[2212.04] child has eaten up our heads, but I wo
[2215.72] n't take it, I don't
[2218.24] think about my daughter, what
[2221.28] kind of relationship will it be, will it happen?
[2225.88] I am going mad thinking this, I don't
[2230.08] even
[2232.76] know, my son should take it out of his mind, he is
[2240.92] not a woman, come on, my son will
[2246.20] go to hell.  She will ruin the whole house,
[2250.04] Satyana will ruin the whole house,
[2253.20] what is the fault of Meena aunty in this, she too can do this much,
[2257.16] I should keep quiet, but she is lying,
[2260.72] listen whatever has happened, you have told her, your
[2264.08] actions, your deeds,
[2268.12] I have refused, you have ruined your life,
[2272.92] Shami uncle was the first to know about AIDS, then you told
[2276.04] Meena aunty to him,
[2281.20] you did not refuse, you rude, shut up, you have no shame,
[2284.24] I have no shame, don't tell me,
[2290.16] my Shamim is not noble, my son, the bad
[2294.52] woman said what, but she said what, but
[2298.20] Abdullah is saying the right thing, your husband is a
[2301.48] criminal, he is also supporting her, he is also going to hell,
[2308.60] Shamim uncle had
[2310.72] disobeyed anything, why did he get such a
[2314.60] disease,
[2316.16] Fatima talks like this to Naano, you all are
[2319.40] not from the house itself, but it does not make any difference, I
[2323.32] swear by God, until the whole world turns against him
[2325.72] They are standing with each other, isn't it? God is
[2328.52] also standing with them
[2333.91] [Music]
[2358.28] What has happened to him? He has to
[2360.80] go to school. He
[2363.56] cannot die.
[2368.76] We have understood. Who should explain it to him? I
[2372.96] thought only animals are found in Madrasas.
[2376.12] Here, the entire city is filled with animals. The
[2383.64] teachers who never got tired of kissing him,
[2387.68] today do not have the courage to make him sit with them. You must get
[2391.44] very angry, don't
[2394.16] you? People's attitude, but
[2397.84] fate. If you
[2401.12] ask the truth, you would hear that he does
[2406.20] not even realize his own pain.
[2412.36] If he is worried about
[2415.92] me, then what was to happen has happened. What will happen to him? Move aside, move aside.
[2438.48] What are you doing? Don't hold your hand, I am
[2442.44] saying, don't move your hand, get up, you will get hurt. Get
[2445.28] up, give up your life. What else do you want to do?
[2448.84] For God's sake, leave this chase behind.
[2452.40] My son, you have eaten me up. I am
[2455.24] saying, move aside, it will hurt me. What can I do? You are
[2460.24] nothing. One, this sister is helping you. On
[2463.08] top of that, there is no need for you to
[2465.08] help me. I am saying, I am hitting you,
[2468.04] right?  I will not be able to give a drop of water, take it away,
[2471.80] leave it, no, no, leave it,
[2474.56] what could I have done, there was no need to
[2476.04] sympathize with them, you sympathized with me, you did not sympathize with me, you
[2479.12] deliberately wore it in front of me,
[2481.28] so that my heart does not rot, take it away, at least take it away,
[2484.44] I am going, sister, you just get up,
[2486.08] for God's sake, sister, what would I do, that
[2508.92] sick woman, what would she understand, what would she
[2519.36] understand, the
[2522.92] disease that she has got, she has happened
[2525.92] because of me, she got ad because of me,
[2529.40] still she is standing with me, despite all the hatred and being
[2532.48] innocent, do you know why, so that
[2535.12] you do not get hurt, she,
[2538.52] her face, I have
[2543.72] ruined her life, your own son
[2548.40] heard it, get
[2554.44] rid of it, leave it
