[89.64] - Enough, Bayji, I've had enough.
- No, son, this isn't right.
[93.24] Look here...
[94.80] We all apologize to you.
[97.28] I take Shammo's guarantee.  He will
fall at your feet and apologize.
[100.80] But don't leave like this
in a fit of rage.  This is no way.
[103.56] Please Bay ji,
he will apologize for your sake.
[105.96] But the inhibitions are gone.
[107.72] You should see how sons-in-law
are treated in other families.
[111.00] But here,
we were humiliated for a cheap girl.
[117.12] Shammo.
Shammo, come here.
[119.36] Come here and apologize.
[122.16] Hurry up.
We cannot anger him.
[125.92] - Bay ji...
- Apologize to him, come on.
[128.60] - See he's apologizing.
- Sorry.
[130.36] See...
[131.28] You said he'll fall at his feet.
But he's still standing.
[134.60] Shammo.
[136.64] Forgive him.
[140.44] Where are you two going?
[145.36] Bay ji, I thought if Umi visits
her parents for a couple of days,
[148.52] it will be a change for her as well.
[150.68] Parents?
[152.20] What parents?
[153.64] No one attended her wedding.
[155.36] Yes.
[160.08] You made a good decision, dear.
[164.00] Very good decision, dear.
[166.08] Very good decision, dear.
[168.64] You didn't make anything for the journey?
Buy something on the way then.
[181.00] Buy something nice
for her on the way.
[183.96] Safe journey.
[185.32] And give my regards
to everyone at home.
[188.60] Go on, dear.
[200.16] God bless you, child.
[202.28] Safe journey.
[212.52] Give my regards...
[219.52] Come in.
[225.96] What are you looking at?
[228.40] Whose is it?
[229.84] Whose?
[232.00] Yours?
[234.80] Are you serious?
[237.16] Obviously, I'm serious.
[239.16] No one will throw you out of here.
[243.16] Not from here or my life.
[255.80] Take your pills on time.
[259.32] Shameem, wait.
[264.76] Thank you.
[267.00] You took special care of my Umaina.
[271.00] You really are a good friend to her.
[273.00] And do visit us.
[296.32] I missed you terribly.
[302.92] I thought of you...
[344.12] Let's go home.
[352.16] What happened?
[354.84] Umaina.
[359.56] Umaina, what happened?
[362.24] Umaina
[363.36] I am...
[364.52] What happened?
What happened?
[368.92] What's wrong with you?
[372.16] Bilal, leave me!  You're hurting me!
[376.64] What's wrong with you?
[378.00] Have you lost your mind?
[379.52] Are we doing it for the first time?
[381.64] What's wrong with you?
[382.96] I don't want it.
[385.92] I don't want this.
[395.32] Umaina!
[396.52] Umaina!
[398.08] Why did I come back,
[401.16] I still wonder.
[403.96] Bilal was in front of me.
[407.04] Shameem had made my
illegal relationship..
[411.52] legal with our marriage.
[416.20] But I still didn't stop.
[423.40] You may say that I
was in love with Shameem.
[429.08] But that was not the case.
[433.20] I wasn't in love with him yet.
[437.72] But yes,
[441.48] I started to trust him...
[444.72] ...again.
[447.92] Shameem won my trust again.
[454.76] I had started acting mature.
[465.64] One thing that I
learned from Shameem,
[473.32] a man who cannot respect a woman...
[477.64] is good for nothing.
[482.76] Maybe that's why
I left Bilal that day.
[487.96] I had him but still lost him.
[492.92] No.
[496.04] No, I didn't lose him.
[499.28] I left him.
[536.00] You must be tired.
[540.20] Get some rest and
[543.80] I will find out how long for dinner.
[545.16] I am hungry too.
[547.20] Shameem...
[551.48] I am very tired.
[554.24] Won't you massage me today?
[581.64] Umi.
[582.84] Umi.
[584.56] I don't want him.
[587.72] Doctor, the patient is in labor.
[590.00] Take her to the labor room.
[591.92] And please leave her hand.
[613.60] Are you with Mrs.  Umaina?
[617.12] Yes.
[618.04] Who are you to her?
[619.40] I...I am her husband.
[623.36] Congratulations.  It's a son.
[625.56] Come with me to the nursery.
[628.12] Let's go.
[636.64] Bed number three.
[653.76] Bilal...
[656.56] Bilal...
[659.96] Do you like kids?
[662.16] Whose?
[664.48] Who else?
[666.16] I am talking about human children.
[668.40] I like puppies more.
[671.52] Come on.
[674.56] I've no interest in a human child.
[679.80] How is that possible?
[681.88] Who doesn't have
an interest in children?
[685.56] I...
[686.40] I like girl children.
[694.52] I love children.
[698.16] Whenever I see any child,
[700.84] I shower my love on them.
[703.56] I was wondering how much
I will love our own children.
[707.04] Our children?
[708.08] Yes.
[709.04] How many do you have on your mind?
[710.60] - Close to a dozen.
- Dozen?
[712.48] Do you want more?
[714.04] I am not a Maulvi, you know.
[717.04] I will awaken the Maulvi inside you,
sweetheart.
[720.20] Just take a step first.
[727.24] I want a child.
[732.24] How would you feel if your sins, remorse
, mistakes,
[737.16] and punishment were kept before you
[744.12] as a living piece of meat.
[750.88] That's how I felt about him.
[756.20] He was born into this world,
[760.16] but like an unwanted,
unwanted object.
[765.36] Just like his mother.
[767.76] God, he's so cute.
[781.60] Umi.
[785.88] Look at him.
[788.08] Look at how cute he is.
[790.80] Like the moon.
[793.20] Bless him.
[796.24] Umi.
[799.96] Umi.
[801.64] Umi.
[802.64] Look at him.
[804.28] I don't want to see him, Shameem.
[806.00] Take him away or
else I will kill him.
[810.88] What are you doing?
[816.88] Umi...
[845.72] Is Rukhsana awake?
[847.28] Tell her to get ready
if she wants to come with me.
[850.32] And listen,
let's go to the hospital.
[856.04] No, not me, Bay ji.
[858.40] Take Rukhsana with you.
[859.92] Come along.
Learn to share other people's joys.
[864.20] Don't be like this.
[866.00] Maybe God will answer your prayers.
[870.60] Fine, don't go.
Go home.
[872.84] I'll go with Rukhsana.
[875.00] Go home and take care of lunch.
[876.84] And anyway, I have to buy
some clothes for the child.
[883.96] What's wrong?
[885.40] Hey.  Take me along.
[886.28] Why did I have to get married
into such a disgusting family!  Quiet
[888.16] !  I don't want to hear you cry!  Quiet
!
[890.08] What happened, Abdullah?
What's the matter this time?
[893.40] Bay ji, go ask Shameem.
[895.24] What has Shameem done this time?
[898.04] Did he misbehave with you again?
I'll talk to him.
[900.40] You guys are in this together.
[902.36] Even you're siding with thieves.
[904.76] Be quiet.  Be quiet.  I'll slap you.
[906.76] What are you doing?
You should fear God.
[909.64] Why are you hitting the poor thing?
[911.36] Umaina had a baby not hers.
[913.24] Everyone's involved
in this disgusting deed.
[916.48] What are you saying, Abdullah?
[917.92] Why are you feeling disgusted
if Shameem's had a child?
[921.48] Amazing, Bay ji, unbelievable.
[923.56] Even you have five children, Bay ji.
[925.40] You know how and
when children are born.
[927.92] Shameem's been married
for only six months!
[930.08] How can he have a baby?
[932.28] Children are God's blessings,
[934.20] he decides when to
bless someone with a child.
[935.92] Don't you know that my
own Choti was born prematurely?
[938.44] God doesn't bless eunuchs.
[940.20] I am raising this question now.
[941.52] Tomorrow the entire neighborhood
will raise this question,
[943.32] that your family willingly accepts adultery.
What will you do then, huh?
[946.20] Forgive us, Lord.
[947.92] Don't bother.
[949.20] All of you covered for the new bride.
[952.36] She doesn't step out of the house.
She's shy.
[954.60] This is how shy she is.
[956.28] Let Shameem return from
the hospital and we'll ask him,
[960.12] whether it's his child or otherwise.
[962.00] Enough.
[963.20] I can give you in writing,
[965.36] even Shameem doesn't know who the father
of this child is.
[968.00] Look, Abdullah, don't talk
nonsense about my grandson.
[972.12] Bay ji, earlier I did
nothing because of our child.
[974.28] But this time I won't
take a minute in divorcing her.
[977.52] And you...
[978.84] If you touch that illegitimate
then I'll show you.
[983.72] Understood!
[987.64] Listen to me... Listen
to me... It
[995.88] doesn't matter whose fault it is,
but I'm the one who gets in trouble.
[998.24] My own family is my biggest enemy.
[1000.40] Leave it.
[1001.36] Leave it or you'll cut your hand.
[1004.08] Don't anyone dare
touch Umaina's child?
[1008.28] I cannot lose my
husband for her sake.
[1017.08] Mrs Shameem,
are you not feeding the child?
[1021.16] This is not right for the child.
[1023.84] Is there a problem?
[1030.52] There's nothing serious.
[1032.40] Everything is fine.
[1033.88] Since the child is premature,
[1035.24] he cannot digest anything
other than his mother's food.
[1038.32] I tried telling her, but...
[1041.64] The nurse did tell me.
[1044.60] Mr.  Shameem, I want to talk to you,
before I discharge your wife.
[1049.20] Please...
[1059.56] Yes, doctor.
[1061.28] Mr.  Shameem, I'm afraid your
wife's in postpartum depression.
[1065.48] What?
[1066.64] Postpartum depression.
[1070.40] Hating your own child..
[1076.36] is like,...
[1081.28] a potter smashing
[1086.20] his own pottery.
[1096.96] That's...
[1101.24] postpartum depression.
[1106.60] It's also called baby blues.
[1112.16] Often women slip into depression
after delivering a child.
[1119.08] They feel disgusted and
hateful towards their own child.
[1133.56] In fact,
[1137.48] they don't hesitate
from taking his life.
[1151.24] Although they have no reason for it.
[1165.92] But Umi...
[1176.04] had a reason.
[1177.72] I am talking to you.
[1179.52] But I don't want to see your face.
[1181.48] Shame on you.  Shame on you, Salma!
[1185.36] You got married and left,
[1187.36] leaving us to deal with this mess.
[1191.76] Don't blame me, Bay ji.
[1193.48] I didn't tell brother
Shameem to marry her.
[1196.24] Your pills, Bay ji.
[1198.72] To hell with Bay ji.
[1199.76] Can't you stay quiet for a minute?
[1201.16] Can't you see I'm
talking to your sister?
[1203.00] Your pills, Bay ji!
[1205.04] What were you saying?
What were you saying?
[1207.76] Who were you two fooling around with, huh?
[1212.16] Tell me.
[1213.20] Please take your pills, Bay ji.
[1215.56] You are just like your father.
You don't have any patience, do you?
[1218.88] Sit quietly or else leave.
[1222.40] You're using my phone
and also yelling at me.
[1228.16] Get lost.  Go away, mannerless.
[1231.20] Take your phone.
[1232.88] Give it back when
you're finished talking.
[1234.88] Give it back...
[1236.96] See this.
[1237.84] You're all the same.
All the same.
[1240.36] This is why I wasn't talking to you.
[1242.12] I knew you would blame me.
[1243.88] I wasn't saying anything...
[1246.20] Who do I blame then?  Who if not you, huh?
[1250.80] You brought her into this house.
[1252.40] You used to sneak her in here.
[1256.12] You've doomed us all.
[1260.48] Now you're living
peacefully with your family.
[1263.84] Raising their children.
[1266.16] And my only son...
[1268.96] my only son... God be with him.
That poor thing.
[1275.08] Get lost.
[1276.32] Get lost,
I don't want to talk to you.
[1278.88] Take it.
[1280.60] Take your phone.
[1285.08] You know this is how she treats me.
[1287.72] - Huh?
- Yes.
[1301.12] I don't want to have it.
[1305.20] Come on, Umi.  Come in.
[1308.24] Come on.
[1309.80] Come on.
[1312.24] Bay ji...
[1316.16] Bay ji, look who is here?
[1322.40] Look how cute your grandson is.
[1324.16] Like a piece of butter.
[1326.52] Bay ji, this is not done.
[1328.16] Why didn't anyone
come to the hospital?
[1330.16] Bay ji?
[1332.24] Bay ji?
[1335.16] What's wrong with everyone?
[1337.72] Why isn't anyone congratulating me?
[1341.24] Choti, get up.
[1343.08] Come hold him.
[1350.76] Humaira, look.
[1355.36] Look how adorable he is.
[1356.72] I was thinking...
[1370.32] Congratulations.  Congratulations.
[1377.64] Congratulations on your child!
[1392.32] Come on.  Come, let's go to our room.
[1411.96] What's the matter?
Why are you all here?
[1413.28] Oh wonderful.
[1415.16] A child is born in this family,
[1416.88] but I've never seen
such silence before.
[1419.40] No child has been born.
[1421.12] You're mistaken.
Get lost.
[1422.40] Don't be so naive, brother.
[1423.96] One should take the blessings
of a eunuch, not our curse.
[1427.80] I'll take gold earrings.
[1431.28] And I'll take only gold
bracelets from the father.
[1434.80] - I'll give you bracelets.
- I am the father.
[1440.76] God bless you.
[1442.92] I am so happy to know.
[1445.64] He stole my heart.
[1447.08] God bless you.
[1448.20] You are so handsome.  Stay blessed.
[1453.36] I want to fly towards you,
although I know I am of no use to you.
[1456.36] God bless you.
Time to empty your pockets, handsome.
[1459.00] Let's celebrate first.
[1513.84] Water?
[1515.24] Get this out of my way.
[1518.04] Eunuchs are dancing outside!
[1519.64] There's a celebration going
on outside.  Did you see it?
[1522.64] Leave it.  Don't pay any attention.
[1524.92] I want to break their jaws.
[1527.32] And especially yours.
[1530.04] What have I done?
[1530.80] That's the problem,
you can't do anything.
[1533.76] Chammo has become a father.  Hello
[1535.36] !
[1536.92] But I'm yet to be blessed.
[1539.76] Lord, you had to choose this barren
woman for me over everyone else.
[1545.52] You've made me worse than a eunuch.
[1548.36] I didn't do it intentionally.
[1551.60] Do you want me to
be like Umaina too?
[1554.12] I don't care what you do.
But I want a child.
[1558.20] - It's not in my control.
- I don't care.
[1561.20] But listen carefully,
[1563.36] I won't stay here
and be embarrassed.
[1565.56] I will leave.
[1566.96] And I will divorce
you first before I leave.
[1601.20] What are you doing here?
[1604.24] Why are you here?
[1605.80] I'll be wherever he'll be.
[1613.08] No, you're not real.
[1618.04] It's my imagination.
[1626.32] Oh, my sweet woman.
[1635.48] This is nothing but imagination.
[1641.36] It's a living example of our love,
[1655.28] and all those beautiful moments.
[1664.36] There was never any love.
It was all a lie.
[1667.16] It was so easy for you to dump me.
[1669.64] How easily you forgot about me?
[1672.36] But why can't I stop
thinking about you?
[1676.76] But Umaina, I...
[1683.04] never left you.
[1687.20] Nor did my memories.
[1690.80] I'll always be here next to you.
[1697.00] When he grows up you'll
see my image in him.
[1703.84] He'll have my eyes,
[1707.12] in which you used to drown with love.
[1712.48] Remember the way you looked at me.
[1717.64] His lips will have my smile on them.
[1723.88] And the desire to kiss them.
[1729.08] I'll be wherever he'll be.
[1734.80] Right here next to you.
[1741.84] Go away!
[1743.76] I said go away!
[1745.88] And take him with you.
[1747.28] I don't want your child,
you, or your love.
[1749.96] I don't want anything.
Get out of here!
[1780.60] He would scream and cry all day.
[1784.88] As if he was trying
to make his existence felt.
[1805.00] He would remind me of my sins,
mistakes, and helplessness.
[1814.40] But I had my ears all shut.
[1821.80] I was completely indifferent
to my sense of motherhood.
[1825.32] Him screaming with
hunger and helplessness,
[1829.92] was actually making me happy.
[1834.00] He was the reason for my doom.
[1837.52] At a time when everyone else,
including me, had denied his existence, Shameem
[1842.64] became a father to him.
[1846.04] Or better yet, a mother to him.
[1851.04] It seemed like he was
born from Shameem's existence.
[1857.00] Even a little restlessness
would worry Shameem completely.
[1870.40] Add some sugar to it.
[1872.36] Bay ji, the doctor said no.
[1875.12] To hell with the doctor.  Come on.
[1877.84] I wonder what spell Umi and her
child have cast on brother Shameem.
[1882.96] No one else exists for him anymore.
[1886.16] Earlier he would
bear all my tantrums.
[1889.12] And now he completely ignores me.
[1892.52] He was the only one who
cared about me.
[1895.28] Now he's not there either.
[1899.08] We thought he'll feel isolated
if we don't talk to him.
[1903.16] But he's isolated us.
[1907.72] We are nothing to him.
His child is everything to him.
[1911.32] Bay ji, how can anyone
love his child so much?
[1918.08] Pray that it's his.
[2029.52] Umi.  Umi.
[2032.88] Look, I've brought
sweetmeat for you.
[2036.20] Made in clarified butter.
[2038.28] You'll love it.
[2039.92] Here, eat it.
[2042.24] Eat it.
[2044.32] I've heard from elders
that after a woman gives birth,
[2047.04] she's literally on her deathbed.
[2049.16] So she should take
extra care of herself.
[2052.40] But you don't take care of yourself.
[2055.08] But it doesn't matter.
[2056.60] You have me.
[2058.20] So you don't have to worry.
[2061.64] You know Rukhsana,
[2062.96] I took care of her
when she had Fatima.
[2065.92] I know how to do everything.
[2070.80] Have you seen Ali?
[2073.32] I take such good care of Ali.
[2077.84] So you don't have to worry.
[2080.64] I'll handle everything.
[2083.60] Get up.
[2085.12] Enough of your tantrums.
[2087.20] I made this especially for you.
[2089.64] Get up.  Come on.
[2092.20] Umi, why are you doing this?
[2121.28] Umi, what are you doing with him?
[2123.92] Leave him.  Leave him.
[2125.52] - He's not your child, leave him.
- The water is cold!
[2127.76] - Let him die.
- You will kill him.
[2129.28] Let him die.
[2131.16] I want him to be dead.
[2133.16] Are you crazy, Umi?
[2134.84] Go away.
[2135.60] Leave him.
[2136.36] I won't give it to him.
[2137.32] Umi...
[2138.56] You should be afraid of God.
[2141.84] You've lost your mind.
[2144.36] You can do whatever
you want to yourself.
[2147.00] But don't you dare touch him!
[2151.08] Madwoman!
[2184.16] What do you want to do?
[2189.48] How can you be so cruel?
[2193.20] I've been treated cruelly too.
[2196.16] Did anyone take pity on me?
[2199.28] No.
[2202.24] Why should I take pity on him?
[2206.88] Why are you punishing
him for your bad decisions?
[2210.76] How can I punish him?
[2213.52] He's my punishment.
[2217.28] If it weren't for him,
Bilal would still be with me.
[2224.04] Bilal.
[2225.56] Bilal again.
[2228.12] Move forward.
[2231.04] He has a right over you.
[2234.60] And he didn't ask
for your permission...
[2237.20] Illegitimate relationships
have no rights.
[2239.16] Illegitimate?
[2241.88] Take a good look at him.
[2248.16] He is beautiful as an angel.
[2251.20] Angel.
[2253.60] He is the son of the devil.
[2257.40] This ba**** is no one to me.
[2259.48] Enough, Umi.
[2264.16] He's already sick because of you.
[2267.20] You don't even feed him.
[2270.52] - If this continues-
- Let him die for all I care.
[2273.16] Take him away.  I don't
want to see his wretched face.
[2278.72] For God's sake, please...
[2285.16] But how can I, alone...
[2286.32] You like to play God.
[2288.60] Then go ahead.
[2290.84] I have no relationship with him.
[2292.88] Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
[2296.44] How I wonder what you are!
[2300.48] Up above the world so high,
[2303.88] Like a diamond in the sky.
[2309.16] When the blazing sun is gone,
[2313.36] When he nothing shines upon,
[2317.04] Then you show your little light,
[2321.00] Your mother is a queen,
[2324.40] Your father is a king,
[2328.48] There's a golden door for the prince,
[2336.00] Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
[2341.00] How?
[2344.40] I wonder what you are!
[2361.20] Umi, what are you doing?
[2364.60] What are you doing?
[2365.68] Have you lost your...
Umi, open the door.
[2368.16] Umi.  Umi.
[2370.28] You're so cruel.
Do you have no shame?
[2373.76] No, no, son.  Stop crying.
[2378.96] Stop crying.  No, no.
[2384.96] Stop crying, my prince.
I'm here now.
[2390.72] I'm here now.  Stop crying.
[2394.40] Umi, open the door.
