Bilal was taking complete
advantage of the situation. He was using Ali
as some kind of trophy. The child he had refused to accept, had now become a
medal of his manhood. Children can be pretty cruel
when they go by their own will. Ali was repeatedly
breaking Shameem's heart. The person who had accepted
Ali was being constantly rejected. The child whose own mother
refused to accept him. Umaina. Yes, Bay ji. Did you mix the spices
properly with the mangoes? Yes, Bay ji. I hope your son doesn't touch them
with his dirty hands and ruin them. Don't worry,
Bay ji, I'll take special care. Okay. Don't worry. These are the worries
that are ruining my old age. Mom, how do I do
this math homework? I don't understand. Miss will scold me. I am busy,
son, go get your father's help. No, he doesn't know anything. Don't be stubborn, Ali.
Take your father's help. Come Ali, I'll teach you. You don't know anything. I'll teach you. No, I hate you. - Don't be stubborn, come on.
- No. Come on. I hate you.  Go away. You little miscreant,
I'll clobber you with my shoe. - Calm down, Bay ji.
- Go away.  I hate you. - Go away.
- Mind your own business. I hate you. I don't like you. Telling your own mother
to mind her business. Tell your little
miscreant some manners. Don't worry,
Bay ji, I'll teach Ali a lesson. Telling me not to worry. It's all your fault.
You spoiled him. You made him what he is. It would never come to this
if he had a child of his own. I wouldn't be crying. I'll teach him. I'll teach him a lesson. There's nothing you can do. The physician we'll
be visiting this time, is known for his
extraordinary medicines. Nothing is going to affect you now. You've grown old. You can't have children now. You should discourage such thoughts. That's not true. I am not that old. And anyway, when God wills, even older women have been
blessed with kids. You must come with me this time. Why should I come along? The doctor said that both husband
and wife should take the medicine. So if there's a problem with anyone... The problem is in you, understand. I could've had half a dozen
children with anyone else. I don't have time to waste
with your bloody physicians. All you do is waste your
time on the mobile phone. Who has time to spare more than you? I'll break that head of
yours with this mobile phone, where these vile thoughts come from. Problem? If there's a problem with me,
then go sleep with someone else. How can you say such a
disgusting thing to your wife? I can. Go. Get out of my sight. You worthless barren woman. I won't be barren for too long. I won't die with this accusation. Never. We'll see about that. I am right here. Put on this cloth,
we're visiting your grandma. I don't want to meet anyone, mother. Rukhsana. Rukhsana. Yes. Yes... I am going to the shop, and later I'll go for the... You're leaving. Fatima's coming home after so long. Spend some time with her. I've said several times, don't interrupt me
when I'm doing God's will. This love and care
are just worldly things. Women and children are
just an illusion, a trial. When will you understand? And you? Where are you going? Fatima has come home
after a long time, so I thought I'll
pay Bay ji a visit. But Fatima's throwing tantrums. Please talk to her. She is right. That's not a home.  It's a brothel. And you want to take your
young daughter over there. - You've lost your mind.
- Come, I'll go with you.
It's getting late. Disgusting. - Is everything going well?
- Yes, sir. Very nice, very nice. Wonderful. No complaints, alright. All good? Excellent.  Excellent. Hi. I am Tony. Hairstylist. I read about the
job opening on Facebook. I'm so sorry, I know I'm late, but is the job still available? Sorry, but we've already
employed someone. Please, don't say that. Look, I'm in a lot of trouble. I am unemployed. You can test me. I told you we are
not hiring anymore, thank you. Look, I am good at my job and, Come on. I mean you should
understand my problem. What do you mean? What else? You know what I mean. Please, one little favor. Fine, we'll see. Thank you. Can I look around? Thank you. After Tony's arrival, there were drastic
changes in my complexes. Do I look like him? This thought was irritating me. Ali's departure... had me scared. Do it well. Greetings, it's been a while. Is he doing well? - Yes, of course.
- Good. Do let us know if
you have any complaints? - Okay, sure.
- Are you satisfied? Yes, sure. Okay, thank you. There's PTM in Ali's school. We've got to go tomorrow morning. You can go.  I'm busy, I can't go. - I want you to go-
- I said I cannot go! I am busy! Sorry. Why are you saying sorry? If you had scolded him the same way, then he wouldn't be
so selfish and mannerless. If you don't want to
attend the PTM because of Ali, then you're being unfair to him. You know he doesn't like it. His friends make fun of him. I don't want that. I've spent my life
hearing these things. I've endured a lot. I don't want Ali
to face these things. Ali is still a child,
but you're mature. If he doesn't respect you, then he'll never
respect himself either. What he's shaping into isn't right. No one loves such children.
They would all hate him. Do you want everyone to hate him? No. So you'll come to the PTM with me. Will you? What's the matter? Is there some kind
of problem in your house? He's always confused, although he's an intelligent child. - Oh, he's so strong.
- I know. Yes, one more. Let's go. Ali, handsome boy. Show me your muscles. Oh my, God.  So strong. Stronger than me. Hi-five. Hi-five. Come on, let's go. Shameem. I know you're in pain. I can understand what
you're feeling right now. I've been wanting to tell you, but I didn't know what to say. Or how to tell you? That's why I insisted
on attending the PTM, so you could see for yourself. Umi... Umi, he'll take Ali from me. Did you notice how
much Ali respects him- Shameem. You know the kind of person he is, and the respect he deserves. He should be embarrassed, not you. Don't be like this. Shameem, he's trying to impress Ali. He's using him as a trophy. Don't let him. Don't. You were right. We should change his school. - Yes.
- No! Yes. That's what I thought earlier. But honestly speaking, changing his school
or friends won't matter. It won't change Ali's perspective. Ali will have to change himself. He must face reality. He has to accept you. What does he know about you? I know how precious you are. Don't be like this. I know you'll pull Ali out of this, just like you did with me. Shameem... I am tired. I am tired. I am tired. I wonder what life wants from me. I am tired. Shameem. The life I know will
only get more complicated. We have to be firm. - You can do it.
- No, I can't do it. You've done it so far.
You've handled everyone. You've handled someone like me, he's still your son. Shameem... I know you're brave. - No... -
You'll be fine.  Hush, calm down. He'll take him away from me. Do you want anything to eat, Fatima? What happened to your face? Did he slap you again? No, Bay ji... Such a weird guy. What's the matter? Listen... She hasn't said a
word since she arrived. Earlier her voice could be
heard all over the house. She's grown up now, Bay ji. She has become
a religious scholar, I guess. Maybe that's why she
became more patient in nature. Patience, my foot. She is always in Umaina's room. Won't even step out. She always wants to do
whatever her father refuses her. I told her not to be so rebellious, but she doesn't listen. What? Nothing,
let me massage your other leg. First, massage this one properly. Where's your mind at? If you have something to say then, say it to
my face, stop following me like a mutt. Sorry, I thought... You thought I could
ridicule this decent girl. Listen...do you have a cigarette? Yes. Won't you offer your
sister a cigarette, as***le? Good lord, the way you talk! Are you going to
offer me in the open? Let's go to a park. We can smoke there. Fatima had decided to rebel against
brother Abdullah's strict nature. Even if she had to
face dire consequences. And on the other hand was Ali, who couldn't be controlled even
after all the love we showered on him. Aren't you Umaina? Bilal's old girlfriend. I saw your pictures. You're beautiful, and also lucky you
didn't marry Bilal. Someone seems to
be in a good mood today. Where do you go every
day looking so chic? Just doing as you ordered. Why are you stressing yourself? For Ali. He's just a kid. Don't worry, he'll understand. We'll be torn miles apart by then. I can see nothing but
hatred for me in Ali's eyes. He doesn't hate you. He's just confused. When he finds out the
things you've done for him, the problems you've endured, then even he will worship
you like me. Umi, I'm a human being. I want love, not devotion. What is it? What is it? I'm only giving you company. I don't want your company. - Come on.
- I said no. Just a little. Mind your own business. Go on. Go.  Get lost. Come on, Champ. Come on, fast. Ali, run. Faster! - That's my boy.
- Yes. Why are you guys so lazy today? Come on. - Yes.
- Come on, faster. Ali, run faster! Raaim had protein shake
with his father. Ali, run faster! Didn't your mom
feed you properly today? Yes, yes, yes. - What's wrong with you, Ali?
- Run. - I can't run.
- Run. Run, yes, yes, run, run... - Faster, faster.
- Come on, run. - Come on, boys, come on.
- Yes, yes. Yes, run faster. I want to see full energy.  Yes. Yes, yes. Come on, Raaim. Come on, boys, come on. Run faster. Quickly.  Quickly. - Faster, Raaim.
- Yes, yes. Faster.  Faster. Yes. I think Ali's having
some serious health problem. No, that's not the case. What happened? Maybe it's psychological. Whenever a child is facing
a mental conflict, I've noticed that it affects
their health as well. Do you get what I'm saying? I think he needs
serious counseling. Come on, Ali, let's practice. No, I don't want
to practice with you! Ali, how can we win
if we don't practice? Come on, son. Bravo.  Get up. Get up, Ali. Won't you listen to your father? Ali, you should
listen to your father. After all,
he is really good at sports. Okay, kids. Although Mr.
Shameem is a proper athlete. He's a champion. He's just a little... When he runs, oh God. Umi, I've sprained my leg. I mean other than that
he's fitter than me, definitely. But sometimes when he exercises, it's like this. It's so hot, with this jacket and all. If Mr.  Shameem does pushups, how would he look? It will look like this. Oh, God.  I am tired! Shammo. Shammo. Shammo. I'm sorry, children,
I was only joking with him. So Mr.  Shameem... What happened? Shammo. What happened? No, please.  Don't do it. It's very painful. But don't worry, Ali, I'll win the parent's
race on Sports' day. Stop being so obsessed
with sports day. Have you seen how
swollen your leg is? How can you run? - In fact, let's drop this idea.
- No, no, you were never going to win anyway. You're such a disappointment, dad. Shut up, Ali. He's right.  I am a disappointment. School's on fire.  It's spreading quickly. Fire.  Fire. School's on fire.  Hurry up. Where are you going? Stop it.  Stop it. Don't clap. Don't make a scene here. Stop this drama. You should all be ashamed. A while ago everyone
was laughing at him! All the men were making fun of him. Mr.  Bilal, muscles don't make a man. A man stands firm
during tough times. A man puts others before himself. He's not a sick chauvinist like you,
who only loves himself. Stop it, Umi. Let me speak. I've no shame in admitting, Shameem stood by
me when no one else did! When I was facing
postpartum depression, Shameem saved Ali. Umi... Your father took care of you
when your own mother rejected you! I wanted to strangle you! Umi, stop it. Let me speak. You were there, Shameem. If it weren't for Shameem, Ali would be long dead. He should be thankful to his father, instead, he thinks his
father is a disappointment. Is this what
competition teaches you? Or every race. Umi. Be aggressive.  Win! Trample over others to win. Use force to show your manliness. Publicly insult your wife. Is this manliness? Shame on you! Stop it.  Stop it. You men are not even comparable
to Shameem's shoes. And I feel sorry for women who have husbands like Bilal. And I feel proud of myself, to have a companion like Shameem. Get up Shameem.. I don't know what came over
me that day! But I had overcome every hesitation, and I spoke my heart out. I don't know how many perspectives
I changed that day, towards Shameem and more like him. But yes, there were some people, my son being on top of the list, I certainly wanted to
see his perspective change.
