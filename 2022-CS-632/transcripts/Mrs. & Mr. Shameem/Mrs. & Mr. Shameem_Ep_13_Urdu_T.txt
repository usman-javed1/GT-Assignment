[90.12] Don't touch me!
[92.60] Disgusting man!
[95.12] You've shown your real colours!
[102.08] I've been punished for your deeds.
[106.60] Is this why you saved me?
[108.44] Don't touch me!
[115.48] How could you do this to me?
[118.20] - Please listen-
- Don't.
[240.12] Is this your prescription?
[242.16] Are you sure?
[299.44] This is so stupid, mom.
[301.48] I don't want to oil my hair.
[302.72] Your hair's filled with dandruff,
[304.20] and you don't want to oil your hair.
[306.08] You look so erratic.
[306.84] Have you seen yourself lately?
[307.48] Bad words, mom.
[309.24] Is erratic a bad word, baby?
[311.72] Straighten up.
[313.08] Mom, it's hurting.
[314.96] What's hurting?
[315.72] Enough of your drama.
[317.08] Hurting.
[317.80] Papa...
[318.80] Papa won't interfere today.
[320.04] He'll be quiet.
[321.12] Sit straight.
[322.32] Umi, he said it's hurting,
leave him alone.
[325.08] He's only making excuses.
He's feeling nothing.
[328.32] Sit straight.
[329.36] Mom, you've nails like a witch.
[332.04] I'll slap you!
[332.92] - Enough!
- Witch, huh?
[334.96] What are you doing, Shameem?
[336.44] He's done for now.
[338.12] He said it's hurting.
[339.76] - He'll lose all his hair, he'll become bald.
- Let him become bald.
[343.04] Shameem.
[360.00] Hassan.
[361.24] Yes.
[362.48] Come here.
[370.12] Shameem sir, are you feeling okay?
[374.84] I'm alright.
[376.08] Why aren't the boys
showing up for work?
[381.32] No one wants to come to work.
[384.92] Even Kasim has joined
a different salon.
[390.00] Why?
[393.08] After what happened that day-
[395.24] Which day?
[398.16] The incident with Tony, sir.
[399.76] The boys are very afraid.
[401.88] Afraid?
[404.08] Tony has quit working here.
[406.92] His brothers won't come
back here to make a scene again.
[409.56] It's not about his brothers.
[412.72] I mean...
[414.16] What do you mean?
[415.24] Be straight with me.
[417.84] God knows what things
Tony has touched.
[421.72] Even I'm afraid of working here.
[425.76] - The other day he was saying-
- No, no, it's all rubbish.
[433.12] I wonder what rubbish
Tony said to the boys that day.
[435.76] Tell the boys to talk to me.
[439.08] Shameem sir, you're very nice.
[441.92] You take good care of us.
[444.20] But even we have a family.
[449.28] Can I give you a suggestion?
[452.84] You should close down this salon.
[457.36] Close down the salon?
[460.32] Is this a joke?
[464.96] As for the stuff,
I can replace everything.
[469.08] And if the boys think
they can blackmail me,
[472.84] then I can replace the entire staff.
[476.00] I wonder what the problem
is now that Tony is gone.
[478.72] But you're still here.
[550.36] Why do you work so hard?
[553.84] Why?
[555.48] Tea.
[556.96] First, you teach at the school,
[562.36] then you spend the rest
of the day in the kitchen.
[570.20] And then you've
not been keeping well.
[573.96] How do you know?
[579.36] I know everything.
[585.36] Where are Humaira and Wajeeha?
[588.20] Let them do the work.
[590.56] There are no free meals here.
[592.36] Thank you for your concern,
but I like being busy.
[596.40] Your tea's getting cold. Finish it.
[600.92] What's wrong?
Your hands are shivering!
[602.08] - It's nothing.
- Are you sure?
[603.04] Yes.
[604.24] - Are you sure?
- Yes.
[629.04] Umi, you finish this tea, I can't.
[633.12] Sorry, I've got mouth ulcers.
[635.76] I'll have something cold.
[637.32] I'll give it to Bay ji.
[639.20] - Don't, I already tasted it.
- What's going on here?
[641.84] Why are you two fighting?
[644.16] Why can't a mother
drink from his son's cup?
[646.80] Leave it, Bay ji?
[648.68] - Why?
- I've been doing it all my life.
[650.00] Leave it
[653.40] What is this, Shameem?
[654.36] You didn't want it a while ago.
[656.56] I'll make a fresh
one for you, Bay ji.
[665.20] Umi isn't well, Bayji, she is tired.
[668.72] You know what, tell Wajeeha
to make some tea for you.
[675.08] - Shameem...
- Come with me.
[676.52] - What...
- Come on.
[681.12] He's finished this one too.
[684.52] What are you doing, Shameem?
[686.04] Now Bay ji will think
I made you do this.
[688.20] I don't care if she does.
Don't tire yourself, please.
[691.40] I am not tired.
Who is going to wash the plates?
[693.40] No one else is going to do it.
[696.12] If you really care about me,
[697.96] then give me a hand
in washing the dishes.
[698.96] Umi, at least think
about your status.
[703.88] You're not the Umi anymore.
[705.96] You're a teacher.
[707.28] What impression will
this have on the students?
[709.28] They will make fun of you.
[712.24] You're being weird, Shameem.
[713.44] I wonder what's wrong with you.
[716.20] Since when did you
become status-conscious?
[718.24] Just try to understand
what I am saying.
[721.80] - Are you feeling alright?
- Yes, I am fine.
[727.04] And what is this mess?
[729.20] What is this?
[730.80] Whose medicines are these?
[732.16] It was next to the money box.
[735.24] Did you take money as well?
[736.92] How did...
[738.60] Why do you touch my things?
[740.72] Always going through all closets.
[742.08] Why are you getting furious,
Shameem?
[743.36] Tell him not to touch my things!
[769.60] Umi was concerned about my nature,
[781.96] and the doctor kept pressurising
me to tell Umi the truth.
[795.88] Because otherwise,
[800.80] I was putting her life at risk.
[806.88] It was easier said than done.
[818.12] One day I decided,
[822.60] to tell Umi everything at any cost.
[827.28] Because her life was more
valuable than my reputation.
[833.04] Shameem, isn't this beautiful?
[837.08] Yes, it's nice.
It'll look nice on you.
[838.88] It's not for me.
[840.04] We'll have to gift Wajeeha
something at her wedding.
[842.20] I really love this.
[843.08] It's a little expensive
but she will love it.
[845.24] Okay, fine. But I've something
important to tell you.
[848.88] Go ahead tell me.
[850.20] Don't worry about the money.
[851.24] I'll pay my share.
But we must gift her this.
[853.84] I like it.
[856.08] They even have matching earrings.
[858.04] What are you saying?
[860.08] I want to talk and you're
worried about Wajeeha.
[862.68] What is more important
than Wajeeha's wedding?
[864.80] - What's the matter?
- Umaina.
[867.04] Umaina.
[868.08] Coming, Bay ji.
[869.08] I'll be right back.
[870.28] Wait.
[879.00] Bay ji, at least play it properly.
[880.40] Give it a nice beat.
[881.36] This is all I can do at my age,
I don't have any more strength left.
[889.96] - Wonderful.
- Yes, Bay ji.
[891.20] - Hey...
- Look, Umaina is here.
[892.56] - Come, join us.
- Look at what they are making me do.
[894.48] - Crazy people.
- Dance with me.
[895.72] O' Allah! I am so tired.
[897.92] Bride's prepare for their wedding,
[900.00] like clothes, jewellery.
[901.40] But she's busy dancing. You want
to dance at your own wedding, huh?
[904.32] Why? Didn't Salma
dance at her wedding.
[907.04] - Didn't she, sister-in-law Umaina?
- Don't ask her.
[909.80] She's her friend.
Listen...
[911.80] You forced her to dance,
she didn't dance on her own.
[914.84] This is a limit. Crazy girl.
[916.56] This isn't right.
[917.84] Why didn't you invite
me to your wedding?
[921.96] Enough, Bay ji. Get up.
[922.92] Now you must get up.
[923.92] - Get up, Bay ji.
- No.
[926.44] Try to understand my legs are weak.
Crazy girl.
[929.92] Shammo...
[931.08] What did I have to discuss with him?
She has made me go crazy.
[934.56] Please brother Shameem,
[936.04] teach me that step
you did at Salma's wedding.
[938.12] You must dance at my wedding too.
[940.44] No need for a veil.
[942.16] Here you go.
[944.20] And get up sister-in-law Umaina.
[946.08] Please, get up. I want you to do the
same step you did at Salma's wedding.
[950.04] - Come on.
- Be quiet.
[952.20] Come on, come on, come on.
[960.04] Sing along with me.
[967.04] Wonderful.
[970.40] God bless them.
[974.20] Look what an excellent
job he's done, Bay ji.
[976.96] I was specific about what I wanted.
[979.96] Isn't it looking nice?
[982.80] It's a nice colour.
[984.00] What happened? Why are you crying?
[987.44] No, son. I am not crying.
[991.60] I am just overwhelmed.
[996.28] After such a long time,
we have a reason to celebrate.
[999.88] Everyone is so happy.
[1001.84] God keep us away from evil eye.
[1004.08] God bless us all.
[1006.44] Don't worry, Bay ji,
[1008.20] with God's grace
everything will be fine.
[1015.20] Umaina.
[1017.32] Come here, child.
[1024.60] Come here, child. Come closer.
[1031.12] Tell me something.
[1032.56] Yes, Bay ji.
[1034.56] I always said mean things to you,
but you never fought back.
[1039.72] Never said a word.
[1047.28] What do you call this relationship?
[1050.28] You act like a daughter
in spite of everything?
[1055.12] You're my mother.
[1057.28] Thank you, child.
[1059.36] What are you saying?
[1061.16] What is that you say?
[1063.40] What do you guys say?
[1065.44] Thank you. Thank you.
[1069.12] No thank you.
[1071.04] Why not?
[1073.72] People don't know what
a big favour you've done to me.
[1081.68] It's okay.
[1083.00] I couldn't imagine Wajeeha
would get a proposal,
[1089.40] and from such a nice family.
[1092.88] Thank God.
[1096.24] How stupid of me!
[1099.32] How do I thank God?
[1101.44] Leave me alone.
[1102.80] Look, he went to sleep.
Leave me alone. Give me a pillow.
[1106.16] He went to sleep on my lap.
[1108.84] I'll go pray and thank god.
[1112.32] I can't even get up.
[1116.48] I'll be right back.
[1123.60] You wanted to say something.
[1128.80] You wanted to say something.
[1132.72] Nothing.
[1147.20] Umi was not like regular wives.
[1153.80] She would never insist on something
I didn't want to talk about.
[1165.20] It would make me
feel angry and love,
[1172.20] that she should force
me to tell her.
[1182.12] And get this burden off my chest.
[1186.72] But...
[1195.52] Then...Wajeeha's wedding...
[1205.80] Helplessness or relief?
[1213.12] I can hide this fact
from her for couple more days.
[1219.88] Take a look,
Rukhsana, take a look at the colour.
[1222.44] Look at this, Bay ji.
[1224.08] Did you get it from the same shop?
[1226.84] No, we looked around.
[1229.00] They are nice. They are lovely.
[1240.96] I'll wear this sari
to aunt Wajeeha's wedding,
[1243.68] won't I look cute?
[1246.60] You want to wear a sari?
Your father will break your legs.
[1250.56] I'll deal with him.
[1258.24] Surprised, aren't you?
[1260.92] I am stepping up for my daughter.
[1267.92] I wish I had made
up my mind earlier,
[1270.40] this father-daughter
wouldn't be torn apart.
[1274.20] Even Fatima yearns
for her father's love.
[1277.36] Even when she's hating him,
[1280.68] she's pining for his love.
[1285.36] Umaina...
[1290.24] Did you invite your family?
[1295.80] Invite them, dear.
[1297.72] Call them.
[1299.92] Weddings are the only time
when we mend broken hearts.
[1304.68] Or death!
[1320.08] Why should I approach them?
[1322.80] If they don't care
whether I'm dead or alive,
[1325.68] then why should I?
[1330.00] It does make a difference,
[1332.20] otherwise, you wouldn't
be so worried and concerned.
[1339.00] You should go.
[1342.12] Umi.
[1348.48] Okay, stop it now.
[1353.16] Stop it.
Stop it.
[1358.08] Stop it.
[1359.32] Everything will be fine.
[1362.56] Come on.
[1396.40] How are you?
[1403.08] Are you okay?
[1419.92] Come with me.
[1438.24] Father.
[1441.72] Father.
[1444.00] Father.
[1445.88] Father.
[1448.40] Father, open your eyes.
[1450.96] Umaina's here.
[1485.08] [PRAYERS]
[1500.08] Okay.
[1530.56] You must eat.
[1531.48] You've pills to take after this.
[1534.00] Have some.
[1561.80] Done.
[1565.20] Father didn't apologise, nor did I.
[1571.68] We both were quite self-centered.
[1577.00] I was shocked to see my father,
[1579.28] and my father to see me.
[1585.48] Once again we didn't meet
each other's expectations.
[1603.08] When I kept meeting father,
took care of him.
[1608.92] I realized how helpless
a person feels burdened by his ego.
[1721.08] Humaira, give me some money.
[1725.88] You're always asking for money.
[1727.48] I don't have it.
[1728.92] Come on, I want to get a shave.
[1730.20] See how weird it looks.
[1735.60] There's some money in the spice jar.
[1744.52] It's only 200 rupees.
[1746.92] That's all I have.
[1749.56] At least keep some money.
[1893.48] Shameem, did you collect
father's medicines?
[1897.96] How long?
[1900.76] Okay, fine. Thank you.
[1907.84] Umaina.
[1909.20] Yes, father.
[1912.32] Come sit next to me.
[1915.16] Let me plate this soup first.
[1916.44] I don't want that thing.
[1921.16] Come sit here next to me.
[1933.68] I cannot muster this courage again.
[1942.48] You don't have to say anything.
[1944.76] No, now is the time.
[1953.36] You have several
complaints against me.
[1959.80] - No, father, I...
- I am still talking.
[1972.08] When you left home,
[1978.00] I decided never to
see your face again!
[1989.56] Owing to your actions.
[1992.28] Anyone else would've
reacted the same way.
[1995.08] No.
[1998.08] Any other father would've
stopped you from leaving.
[2003.32] Even if he had to use force.
[2012.24] But I saw it was better you left.
[2024.48] It's true.
[2028.56] Whenever your thought
crossed my mind,
[2031.84] I would calm myself by abusing you.
[2039.84] It's true.
[2044.68] I was a selfish father.
[2051.20] A very bad father.
[2060.52] Look
[2062.12] Don't do it, father.
[2064.96] Forgive me, dear. please forgive me.
[2081.96] Shameem.
[2092.32] Son, how do I thank you?
[2099.08] I couldn't take care of my daughter,
or protect her.
[2108.96] You gave my daughter respect.
[2115.60] Come here.
[2127.96] Those were father's last words.
[2165.12] I never could imagine
that father would die.
[2169.16] Everyone has to die one day, Umi.
[2171.88] Promise me,
Shameem, you won't die before me.
[2189.12] Hurry up, it's getting late.
[2193.20] Need a facial.
[2196.08] My sweetheart's waiting for me.
[2199.48] Didn't you work for Shameem before?
[2203.68] Yes.
[2205.16] What happened?
[2206.32] Did he fire you?
[2208.48] I can put in a
recommendation for you.
[2210.00] He's my brother-in-law.
[2212.20] I know.
[2213.80] But that's not required.
[2215.72] Shameem sir didn't fire me,
[2217.80] I quit.
[2219.20] Aren't you ashamed?
[2220.84] Trying to be a wise guy.
[2222.56] Address madam as sir.
[2227.88] What happened?
[2230.56] He always admits that
his boys are very loyal.
[2233.48] So what happened?
[2234.84] I think the Salon will close down.
[2237.08] It was closed the other day as well.
[2238.56] Please, don't talk
about the Salon here.
[2241.20] My boss is watching.
[2242.28] Why not?
[2244.20] I am talking about the salon,
not a brothel.
[2247.52] Don't you know?
[2248.88] What?
[2249.96] The incident with Tony?
[2251.96] The junior eunuch?
[2253.36] What's wrong with him?
[2255.56] I'll tell you everything,
but not here.
[2259.20] Tell me everything.
[2274.20] "Come join in and do the dance."
[2280.16] Oh no!
[2284.08] "Life is so unpredictable."
[2288.32] "You never know when
you'll breathe your last."
[2292.72] "Life is so unpredictable."
[2299.40] "Come join in and do the dance."
[2322.72] Humaira...
[2327.24] I don't have any money.
[2330.60] You always get me wrong.
[2333.60] As if I am a scoundrel.
[2336.44] But not at such a time?
[2344.96] What do you mean?
[2347.04] Come here,
[2349.48] before it's too late.
[2352.60] Come here.
[2366.88] You have to be firm to
hear what I am going to say next.
[2375.32] You know, Shameem...
[2379.36] Shameem!
[2384.60] Shameem!
[2386.76] Shammo!
[2388.20] Shammo!
[2391.08] Shammo!
[2393.68] Shammo!
[2397.92] What is Khurram saying?
[2401.32] What rubbish is he talking about?
[2406.48] You have AIDS?
[2414.24] For God's sake,
[2417.04] don't tell Bay ji about this.
[2421.00] At least not until
Wajeeha's wedding.
[2425.96] Finally, happiness
has knocked on our door.
[2429.84] Bay ji and Wajeeh are elated,
don't spoil their happiness.
[2437.20] It will ruin everything.
[2445.12] On one end is your sister's wedding,
[2449.00] and on the other is
your sister-in-law's doom.
[2453.12] I wonder what else poor,
helpless, Umaina's destiny beholds.
[2459.12] She was already an orphan,
now she will be a widow.
[2463.96] For God's sake,
[2468.00] don't say such negative things.
[2475.08] Don't you dare tell Umaina anything?
[2479.00] What do think I am?
[2480.72] I would've told
her first if I had to.
[2482.88] Poor Umaina's been...
She is the one who has been deceived.
[2490.60] But...I cannot endure
this pain for too long.
[2500.04] I think we should tell her.
[2501.88] No.
[2502.36] So she can make her arrangements.
[2504.80] For God's sake,
you don't have to tell her anything.
[2508.40] I will talk to her.
[2509.76] I know how to break the news to her.
[2512.24] Don't worry, I am there.
[2515.88] I mean we're here to look after her.
[2518.32] We'll look after her. Promise!
[2520.00] Bay ji was right.
[2523.00] Happiness never comes alone,
[2526.44] it also brings some
kind of sad news with it.
[2530.88] It is the result of an evil eye.
Everything is ruined.
[2537.68] You're whining like
he's already dead,
[2540.08] and his funeral's lying here.
[2541.84] He's still alive. He's with
us for a couple of more days.
[2544.28] Curse you!
[2546.92] You always hurt my feelings.
[2551.20] My brother... I you.
[2558.96] I...
[2560.36] Humaira.
[2561.60] Humaira, stop it.
[2563.36] It's God's will.
[2567.20] My wife is very emotional.
[2570.44] Look at you.
[2571.84] So patient, so calm.
[2574.44] You're facing death,
[2576.28] yet you're standing firm!
[2580.84] Sometimes Humaira
makes no sense at all.
[2587.08] Just yesterday she was saying why
don't you start your own business.
[2590.20] How long will you
be a live-in son-in-law?
[2594.20] I know she is right.
[2596.44] But it's not easy to
secure money for a business.
[2599.76] And who would lend money
to a useless man like me?
[2603.92] But this is the right
time to prove myself.
[2615.00] I've an idea.
[2616.80] Sit, I'll tell you.
[2618.84] Sit over there.
[2622.80] Sit.
[2625.96] Why don't you start
some business for me?
[2630.36] Me?
[2631.28] Yes.
[2632.76] Your salon's already closed down.
[2634.56] They say an empty
shop and an empty mind,
[2637.16] is a devil's workshop.
[2639.44] And you know about me.
[2641.48] What if I say something?
[2644.68] Wajeeha's wedding can be ruined.
[2648.36] And you'll be leaving us,
sooner or later.
[2657.08] So I must be financially strong.
[2661.72] But don't tell Humaira.
[2666.20] And you know about me,
I don't like to talk to anyone.
[2670.80] Women make a mountain out of a mole.
[2675.08] When you have made the arrangements,
[2680.12] you can whisper in my ears. Got it?
