[91.04] Life was running away from me,
[100.52] and I was roaming around
like a straw in the wind,
[107.52] with my death warrant.
[110.64] The faces of my relatives were
revolving in front of my eyes.
[118.00] Bay ji.
[120.88] Ali.
[123.08] Umi.
[127.00] Time's my witness,
[127.92] I never showed haste
in living my life,
[133.88] but now time was slipping
through my fingers.
[141.28] Rukshana, please don't cry.
[143.44] You'll be fine.
[146.00] You'll fall sick.
I am worried about you.
[150.48] With God's grace,
Fatima will be fine.
[154.20] I'll visit tomorrow morning.
[155.40] Should I make her something to eat?
[157.80] Calm down first.
[162.84] Take care.
[164.88] Goodbye.
[173.88] Shameem?
[178.28] Where were you?
[180.44] Where did you disappear to?
[185.80] I was just...
[189.12] I couldn't see Fatima's condition.
[193.20] Allah will bless
Fatima with His grace.
[196.64] Sister-in-law Rukshana's
condition is worse than Fatima's.
[199.80] She can't stop crying.
I was just talking to her.
[204.00] I was wondering how difficult it is,
[206.16] for parents to see their
children in this condition.
[208.80] I went to the hospital
only for a while,
[210.48] and I was already worried about Ali.
[215.24] Then I thought,
[217.04] Ali will be fine as
long as you're around.
[220.16] Did you eat?
[222.32] I know you haven't.
[224.00] I'll go get it.
[256.64] Shameem, eat your dinner.
[260.88] Ali is a grown-up now, Umi.
[263.96] He should sleep alone now.
[266.44] I've been saying
that for a long time,
[268.92] but you love him so
much you don't let him go.
[271.32] He might adjust without you,
but can you?
[274.60] There's less space on the bed now.
[276.96] The bed's quite adequate,
[278.88] but maybe you feel that way
because your dear son,
[281.44] sleeps on your side.
[283.84] You can sleep on my side,
and I'll sleep in your place.
[285.88] No.
[291.64] I'll go fetch a mattress,
[293.12] tomorrow I'll get
him a separate bed.
[302.84] Here you go.
[303.56] Enough.
[305.12] - Have a sip.
- I said I've had enough.
[309.44] Why do I get all the
stubborn people in the world?
[317.24] I feel sorry for you, mom.
[320.48] You're stuck in all this.
[323.08] On one side is that temperamental god
and on the other is me.
[329.88] A disobedient daughter.
[334.24] Your life is over.
[337.24] When you have a clue
about my problems.
[339.52] Then why don't you
make things easier for me?
[345.64] Tell me what to do?
[348.12] Forgive your temperamental god
[356.52] No!
[362.28] Whether you forgive him or not,
[365.92] for God's sake
don't ruin your life.
[370.40] I've already lived mine,
[373.24] but you've a long way to go.
[391.76] Look at him.
[393.40] I don't like his face.
[395.24] He should stop acting.  Curse him.
[398.24] Hey,
[400.64] leave it.
[408.80] Bay ji, why are you eating
so many sweet biscuits?
[413.08] Don't you know what the doctor said?
[415.28] Doctors are crazy.
[418.32] They don't know what to
do or what not to do.
[423.00] It will be the grace
of God if I die like this.
[428.40] Listen to me.
[431.60] God has already decided
everyone's life.
[435.68] Not a minute before
or a minute after.
[439.00] You die when you are supposed to die.
[442.00] If you're destined to stay, you
'll stay,
[444.04] if you're destined to go, you'll go.
[445.32] But with all their
desires fulfilled.
[449.52] See...
Isn't it.
[451.04] - Stop.  Leave it.
- No...
[452.76] You've had enough.
Leave it.
[455.24] Get rid of it.  Fine.
[457.64] I can't even eat anything I
like when you're around.
[459.32] You'll make me starve to death.
[463.08] You can eat all you
like when I'm not around.
[467.00] How can you say that?
[469.20] Stop scaring me.
[470.40] Stupid man.  What happened?
[472.28] Don't be like this.  Come here.
[474.64] I am coming.  What's the matter?
[476.96] Tell me, son.
[479.24] Listen to me.
[481.28] Don't be like this.  Come here.
[483.64] Come, give me a hug.
[486.08] Don't be like this.
[487.80] Don't make me cry.
[489.52] Tell me what's wrong.
[491.28] God bless you, son.
What's the matter?
[496.20] Get rid of these biscuits.
[498.96] I will never eat them again.
[560.80] Same reports.
[564.80] Doesn't matter how many
times you get your reports done,
[568.16] the reports won't change.
[570.88] Do you enjoy seeing people in pain?
[573.88] You could've said that they've
made a mistake again, Shameem.
[578.92] This is not possible.
[582.40] I don't want to give you false
hopes and be careless with you.
[590.48] The sooner you
understand the better.
[597.20] Shameem, delay won't get
you anything but more harm.
[605.88] What have I done?
[608.56] I've never done anything wrong.
[614.52] Are you married?
[621.80] Yes.
[626.00] Any other sexual relationships?  For
[627.64] God's sake no.
[633.12] Children?
[636.04] I have a son.
[643.60] Shameem, I suggest that you take your
wife and son for an HIV test as well.
[651.44] They are at high risk.
[684.48] What could I have told her?
[687.76] Why am I getting these tests done?
[694.32] Whereas even I didn't
know how I got it.
[701.52] And if she got it from me...
[710.80] It was a lot easier... ...
[717.08] to not let her know, that I...
[760.40] When a person is facing death,
[764.64] their first reaction is denial.
[769.32] He staggers on the thin
line between hope and denial,
[774.08] like a child on a swing.
[779.40] Now that I think about
it I feel very sad.
[784.60] The pain that Shameem was facing,
[788.24] alone.
[792.88] He was unable to tell anyone.
[796.76] His pain, his fear,
[800.60] he was unable to share with anyone.
[803.80] Not even with me.
[807.84] I was unaware but I could feel,
[815.88] that something between
us is changing drastically.
[822.52] I don't want to sleep.
I don't want to sleep.
[823.84] I want to sleep with dad.
[825.08] Sweetheart,
try sleeping alone for a change.
[826.84] You'll like it.
Come here.
[828.20] I want to sleep with dad.
What is your problem?
[830.48] Now you're misbehaving,
I will slap you.
[832.20] It's getting late,
you've got school tomorrow.
[833.32] - Now sleep.
- Stop it.  Don't scold him.
[835.56] He is not sleeping.
[836.44] He'll sleep.
[837.96] Give me a hug, dad.
Please, please, please, dad.
[841.52] Enough!
[843.28] It's not nice to be
stubborn all the time!
[845.76] You're a grownup now.
Learn to behave like one.
[849.24] I can't be with you all the time.
[853.16] Now go sleep on your bed.
[872.92] Tony.  Where were you all this time?
[876.88] And what happened?
[878.44] What happened, Tony?  Tell me.
[879.68] I'll tell you everything later.
[881.16] For God's sake, hide me.
[882.28] Where are you hiding?
[883.20] What happened?  Tell me something.
[885.32] I'll tell you everything,
but for God's sake please hide me.
[888.56] What happened?  Tell me something.
[890.92] Those people will kill me.
[891.88] Who?
[893.44] Who?
[894.28] Tony.
[895.92] Tony.
[897.28] Tell me something.
Tony.
[902.44] Tony.
[903.48] What's the matter?
[904.24] Open the door.
[904.92] There's no one here.
[905.80] Open the door otherwise,
I'll break it.
[906.84] There's no one here.  Go away.
[908.24] Open the door or else...
[911.04] Break the door.
[912.44] Open the door or else...
[913.12] Fine, I'm opening the door.
[913.92] - Open it.
- Okay.
[916.20] Where is Tony?
[917.48] He came this way.
[918.24] - There is no Tony here.
- Bring him out.
[919.76] I said there's no Tony here.
[921.04] - He's a thief.
- There is no Tony here.
[924.32] I said he's a thief.
[925.96] That's not possible.
[927.88] I see.  That means he's inside.
[929.24] - No...
- Tony.
[931.16] - Where do you think you're going?
- Tony!
[932.80] This is my property.
I'll call the police.
[934.88] Get out.
[935.64] - Are you threatening me?
- Yes, I am.
[937.44] [ __ ], how dare you threaten me?
[938.96] Wait, I'll show you.
[941.96] What are you doing?
[943.88] I'll cut you to pieces
with this razor.
[946.56] Leave him!
[948.20] Leave him!  He's got nothing
to do with this matter!
[951.28] Why are you dragging
him into all this, brother?
[953.84] Brother.
[955.88] You're not my brother.
[957.08] Where is mother's jewellery?
[958.68] I won't give it back.
[960.52] I am your brother!
[962.16] - Don't call me your brother!
- She was my mother too.
[964.92] Rascal, scoundrel,
I have no relationship with you.
[968.88] Can any of you?
[970.20] Can any of you call
him your flesh and blood?
[975.56] See...
[976.80] No one wants to have
any relationship with you.
[979.88] You're bad blood!
You've a bad reputation!
[983.32] You're bad.
[984.64] You're bad.
[985.84] I am bad blood, ain't I?
[986.96] Yes.
[987.76] - I am bad blood, ain't I?
- Yes!
[989.44] Tony!
[992.20] Here...
[993.48] Is this your family blood?
[995.84] Take it.
[996.92] Take every drop out of my body.
[999.80] Have you lost your mind, Tony?
[1001.16] Yes, I've lost my mind.
[1002.44] Tony...
[1003.52] Here.  Here.
This is the bad AIDS blood.
[1007.00] Take it.
[1008.24] I'm dying anyway,
you take it too.
[1011.92] - He's lost his mind.
- Touch it.
[1015.52] Where are you going, rascals?
[1045.88] Are you okay?
[1052.76] What...
[1069.48] How are you?
[1072.04] I am alright,
[1073.20] thank God.
[1102.16] I thought I'd ask
about your condition.
[1106.28] Are you feeling better now?
[1107.40] I am better now.
[1118.88] Umaina.
[1123.12] You've been very
cruel all your life.
[1125.28] Me?
[1126.24] I never considered
a good soul all my life.
[1129.44] Or consider yourself
a part of the family.
[1132.08] And you had no history for
which I could applaud you.
[1136.20] I only followed Allah's orders.
[1139.92] What did I do wrong?
[1146.64] Brother Abdullah,
it's your own point of view.
[1148.92] I don't call you bad.
[1152.04] But I won't believe that
Allah hates his ungrateful devotees.
[1156.92] Because if he did then
I would have never found Shameem.
[1162.36] What do you want?
[1164.88] Do you want Fatima to find
someone like Shameem?
[1169.20] You have ruined my
entire life's effort.
[1176.96] I know my daughter hates me,
[1180.92] and I don't care.
[1185.68] But she's distancing herself
from Allah because of this hatred.
[1191.24] She considers you her idol.
[1194.16] Please talk to her.
[1196.04] Her father only wants
good things for her.
[1199.32] But I know you won't talk to her.
[1203.88] You've been cursed
by Humaira herself.
[1207.68] You know what,
[1211.04] you need to collect
blessings and not curses.
[1226.16] When I left home,
[1230.20] my mother kissed my forehead.
[1238.32] There was regret in her eyes.
[1244.00] All her life she couldn't
do anything for me.
[1249.32] And finally, she gave
me her entire life's earning,
[1252.28] her jewellery.
[1264.48] You keep it.
[1267.68] This will pay for your losses.
[1273.20] You cannot pay for my losses.
[1279.12] This loss cannot
be repaid in this life.
[1286.28] You've ruined my life.
[1292.16] You put an end to everything.
[1300.80] Can you return my life to me?
[1306.24] Tell me.
[1310.84] You have nothing to say.
[1317.28] You couldn't even make
peace with your own family.
[1324.52] This thought is driving me crazy,
[1329.40] what have I done?
[1333.24] What was my mistake?
[1338.08] What have I done?
[1346.20] And whenever I think of a reason,
[1348.04] I can only think of you.
[1351.64] What are you saying, Shameem?
[1353.64] What have I done?
[1359.88] I have AIDS.
[1362.88] AIDS.
[1367.56] Because of you.
[1371.84] I'm paying for your doing.
[1377.80] My life is ruined.
[1383.52] This is how you repaid
my love and emotions.
[1390.04] It's all over for me now.
[1402.52] You too?
[1410.76] Don't laugh, scoundrel.
[1418.24] It was nice to hear you abuse.
[1422.76] But what to do?  It's pretty funny.
[1432.08] Oh, Lord.
[1436.60] I deserved it.
[1440.28] I was your criminal.
[1446.04] I deserved it.
[1450.96] But what was this
decent man's fault?
[1503.84] What happened?
You didn't go to the salon today?
[1511.08] What's the matter?
Why are you so quiet?
[1529.20] This...
[1531.80] It's a love bite.
[1536.00] Love bite?
[1537.48] I am joking.  It's a mosquito.
[1540.52] The place is infested
with mosquitoes.
[1541.92] They keep biting the entire night.
[1543.76] I noticed some on
Ali's arms as well.
[1545.52] He had several marks.
[1548.24] I think I'll have to go myself.
[1550.24] I'll go and get the spray.
[1553.52] You know what, get Ali ready, I've got to
[1555.88] take him to the hospital.
[1557.76] - Hospital for a mosquito bite... -
Just do as I said.
[1560.56] Don't ask questions.
[1562.64] What's the matter?  Why are
you so sensitive about Ali's case?
[1565.92] I'll apply a cream, he'll be fine.
[1570.12] Okay, fine.  Don't get angry.
[1571.76] I'll get him ready.
[1573.56] Let me finish this work first.
[1584.80] Shall we?
[1586.76] Shameem?
[1588.84] Shall we go inside?
[1592.32] No, let it be.
[1595.04] What do you mean let it be?
[1596.56] You insisted on coming here
and you don't want to go inside.
[1600.00] Leave it.  I'm sure it's nothing.
[1602.52] It's nothing.
[1604.08] I'm sure it's nothing.
[1605.24] What do you mean it's nothing?
[1608.68] You think he's got dengue.?
[1610.80] Now that we're here
let's get tested.
[1611.96] No, leave it.
[1614.08] It was a surprise.
[1615.24] Yeah, dad.  What's the surprise?
[1618.04] I love surprises.
[1619.88] We haven't gone out for so long.
[1623.48] So I thought why don't
we go for a long ride.
[1626.92] If I had told your mom this at home,
[1629.20] she would have brought
Bay ji and Wajeeha along.
[1631.76] Right Ali?  Isn't it.
[1632.80] Yeah, mom is so boring.
[1635.08] Let's go to some Play Area.
[1636.76] Leave me.  Sit back properly.
[1638.56] Shameem.
[1639.52] Don't keep hugging me all the time.
[1641.92] Wear your seatbelt.
[1644.80] Wear it.
[1651.48] It happened several times.
[1653.96] My feet would often freeze
on the way to the hospital.
[1659.88] I hadn't recovered
from the shock completely.
[1666.88] I didn't have the
strength to hear... ...
[1673.04] something similar
about Umaina and Ali.
[1678.48] I wanted to live that
moment to the fullest.
[1685.08] This beautiful universe...
[1687.08] ...which I built brick by brick.
[1696.04] Even though it was like a fantasy,
[1700.88] I wanted to keep
it alive as long as I could.
[1708.12] I wanted to keep it alive.
[1711.88] Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!
[1713.96] Hey!  Hey!  Hey!
[1714.96] Grandma, do you know
where we went today?  - Yes?
[1718.56] No, I don't know.
[1719.84] And how much fun we had.
[1721.52] I even bought this.
[1723.44] Great.
[1724.48] Now go to your room
and have more fun.
[1727.16] These things are not for us.
[1729.28] All we get is disappointment.
[1731.24] Me and Wajeeha both.
[1733.20] You guys have all the fun.
[1735.16] - Visit the zoo...
- Bay ji.
[1738.08] For God's sake at least don't
say such things in front of the kid.
[1740.68] Why?  Why not?
[1742.32] Are you worried at all?
[1743.92] Are you worried about me?
[1745.48] Your sister's been crying all day,
[1748.84] but you're busy sightseeing.
[1751.52] Take them here, there, everywhere.
[1754.24] I told you to give
some thought to her too,
[1757.52] but no one cares.
[1759.20] No one does.
[1761.16] And that Tony...
[1762.40] Listen to me carefully.
[1764.60] Where is that Tony?  He ran away too.
[1766.92] Maybe he got married too.
[1768.60] You do nothing.
I'm telling you,
[1770.84] I won't die with this pain.
[1775.80] Why do we talk about dying?
[1777.76] What else should I do?
What else should I do?
[1780.64] I feel dead inside already.
[1785.36] How do I explain to you?
[1786.88] You've forgotten all about
your mother, and your sister.
[1789.40] I can't bear her sorrows anymore.
[1791.56] I look hale and hearty to everyone.
[1793.84] But no.
[1795.12] - I am dead on the inside.
- Don't say that, Bay ji.
[1798.84] Don't say such things.
[1801.32] Forgive me.
[1804.16] Maybe I couldn't be your good son,
[1806.16] but I don't mean to make you sad.
[1815.32] Forgive me.
[1818.68] No, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
[1823.36] I was just casually saying it.
[1827.08] It's okay.
[1830.32] Okay?
[1833.24] I took on the responsibility
to find a groom for Wajeeha.
[1839.24] Although I never made any
right choices for myself in life.
[1847.00] So I was scared.
[1849.88] But with God's grace,
[1852.60] we found a good
proposal for Wajeeha.
[1856.00] And the wedding was fixed.
[1857.92] By God, she's so gorgeous.
[1865.12] Bring your right hand out, son.
[1868.08] Now she's our daughter.
[1870.68] Congratulations.
[1889.16] From that moment I began
to understand Shameem's problem.
[1894.04] But I was assured that
things were going right.
[1899.52] But I was worried.
[1903.32] Something bad is going to happen.
[1908.08] I tried to forget,
[1911.88] but brother Abdullah's
comment about the curse,
[1916.08] was etched on my mind.
[1926.28] Look at this shawl.
[1928.16] - It's beautiful.
- It's nice.
[1929.84] It will look really nice with that.
[1930.92] It will.
[1932.32] And this?
[1933.28] This will look nice,
occasionally, right?
[1935.68] - for dinner, or maybe somewhere outside.
- They had another color in this.
[1938.28] You like all the colors.
[1939.64] Show us the mustard
color that you had.
[1942.20] Take a look at this.
[1944.80] Show me properly.
[1947.56] Look at the work done around the neck.
[1950.20] Do you have more
colours for this?
[1955.08] But I don't like this work...
[1958.00] I liked the work done around the neck.
[1959.44] - This will go well with it.
- Yes, it will.
[1962.32] Sister Umaina.
[1964.48] Who are you?
[1967.04] I am Marooq.
[1973.16] I was beginning to realize that
depression was affecting my health.
[1980.60] Father never loved me.
[1986.68] I think sometimes
that did he miss me?
[1993.52] Did he keep cursing me?
[1999.28] How many children do you have,
sister-in-law?
[2003.08] I have a son, Ali.
[2006.44] He must be cute like you.
[2011.16] Are you married?
[2014.00] You always told mom that daughters
of witches don't get married.
[2022.56] I did get married,
[2025.16] but we got divorced.
[2027.64] It was a good thing.
[2031.12] I know you won't ask,
[2034.24] but I'll tell you anyway.
[2036.24] Mom hasn't changed,
she still has an attitude,
[2041.60] but I didn't see any change in father
for a long time after you left.
[2047.92] But I wonder why he's been
mentioning a lot about you recently.
[2055.24] Doesn't matter.
[2058.12] It's been a long time.
[2061.04] Yes, it's been a long time.
[2065.64] But father has very less time.
[2070.88] What do you mean?
[2074.52] Father has cancer.
[2078.00] He was diagnosed last year.
[2081.60] He misses you a lot, sister.
[2085.84] Will you come to see him?
[2097.04] It's getting late, I must leave.
[2111.92] Don't you dare!
[2113.84] Don't you dare!
[2115.56] Stay away from my daughter!
[2118.24] I couldn't retaliate
earlier Abdullah Ahmed,
[2121.24] but if you touch my daughter again,
I'll chop them off!
[2127.84] Go away.
[2136.24] Go!
[2147.48] I can understand your problem but,
[2150.92] Shameem your attitude
is very childish.
[2157.24] The fear that your wife and
child's test might be positive,
[2163.96] you don't want to get them treated.
[2166.84] This isn't right.
[2173.76] By doing this you're
increasing the risk factor.
[2189.00] Look, living in denial
will get you nothing,
[2192.92] except for pain.
[2196.68] From where could
I muster the courage?
[2199.80] I can't tell them.
[2203.56] How will I face them?
[2205.88] The disease is not the problem.
[2209.44] But your attitude certainly is a problem.
[2219.88] The disease is manageable.
[2222.88] but for that,
it has to be treated on time.
[2227.52] And to start the treatment one
should get the tests done on time.
[2232.16] So I advise you to get
your wife and son tested.
[2245.92] And then the day came...
[2249.68] ...which I feared.
[2253.68] The blood test reports arrived.
[2258.92] Blood test for HIV.
[2264.24] Patient Ali Shameem, negative.
[2272.60] Patient Umaina Shameem...
[2279.24] ...positive.
