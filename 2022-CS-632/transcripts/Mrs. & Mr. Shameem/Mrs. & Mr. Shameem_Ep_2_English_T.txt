[89.92] I told you!
[91.40] I told you I won't like this dress... ...
[93.20] yet you forced me to wear it!
[95.56] You're looking pretty decent.
Stop complaining.
[100.00] They had it stitched for
you out of love and compassion.
[103.52] But your whining doesn't seem to end.
[105.12] You're going to stir things up.
[108.36] From what angle does it look nice?
[109.40] From what angle does this dress look nice?
[110.88] I look so ugly and
overweight in this dress.
[113.00] I'm not going to the wedding!
[114.52] You can go alone!
[115.44] You're always making faces,
always complaining.
[121.04] You never like anything...
Never...
[124.00] Bay ji...stop it!
[128.88] No one likes to argue all the time.
[131.32] - Shammo, I was only... -
Please, I don't need your help.
[138.80] What's the matter, Choti?
Why are you worried?
[140.56] Look, brother, Allah gave
me all the flaws of mom and dad.
[144.80] And now this dress.
[145.84] I don't want to wear this dress.
[146.88] I won't go to the wedding.
You guys can go.
[148.44] Okay, fine.
[153.80] Take off the dress.
I'll get you another one.
[156.96] Come on, get up.
[158.20] And go.
[159.60] Go on.
[163.60] Forget it.
[171.80] Shammo.
[175.20] Look at me.
[178.40] Look at me!
[184.56] What's wrong?
[189.20] What is wrong?
[197.80] There are too many white flowers.
Add some more red flowers.
[199.68] Okay.
[200.44] Unbelievable.
[202.88] Hurry up.
[206.40] Babaji, let me see the plates.
[208.92] Are they clean?
[212.60] Clean them properly.  Did
[215.40] you hear?
[233.52] Umi.
[238.64] Umi.
[241.04] We need to talk.
[243.76] I'm in no mood to talk.  Leave.
[273.68] Shammo, there's definitely
something wrong here.
[278.40] I am not asking, I am telling you.
[280.48] Something isn't right.
[283.56] Something seems off.
[285.36] Look...
Not you.
[287.28] The guy that arrived last night...
[289.28] ...in the black suit and red jacket.
[291.48] There's something between him and her.
[296.28] I'm not talking in the air.
[297.40] I've been keeping an eye.
[298.92] I can tell how long a
girl has been spending time with the boy.
[304.00] I know.
[306.04] Who would know your ill
intentions better than me?
[309.00] Pay more attention to Humaira.
[311.00] She seems sad nowadays.
[312.80] You know how big my attention span is.
[317.40] There's adequate left
even after focusing on Humaira,
[321.36] which I then focus around me.
[327.68] When you have time,
[330.40] do tell her about my attention span.
[334.32] No time you say?
[340.44] Rascal!
[342.92] Dog!
[345.64] What are you looking at me for?
[346.88] Carry on.
[355.60] You look absolutely beautiful.
[357.44] Thank you, sweetheart.
[359.04] - The Bangles--
- Bay ji.
[360.92] Hello!  Welcome!
[362.36] Oh great!
[363.96] You left the girls alone?
[365.32] Oh, I see.
[369.88] Bay ji,
the wedding procession has arrived.
[371.20] Go on.
[372.08] Huh?
[373.16] - Shammo?
- Salma.
[376.24] Girls.  The wedding procession has arrived.
[379.04] The wedding procession...
[380.88] It has arrived.
[383.36] She's looking like such a sweetheart.
[394.36] What are you waiting here for?
[395.72] Don't you want to see
Salma's wedding procession Umaina?
[398.08] You're part of the family.
[400.00] Right?
[400.64] Absolutely right, Bay ji.
[401.80] And she's behaving like a guest.
[406.20] Come on, hurry up.
[408.28] Here.
[409.44] Go, have a look at the wedding procession.
[414.04] God save you from every evil eye.
[417.36] Hurry up.
[475.12] Congratulations, Bay ji.
[477.04] Oh.
[479.40] Congratulations.
[480.52] Congratulations.
[484.00] Hey...
[485.60] Brother.
[486.68] Congratulations.
[489.28] Congratulations, brother Abdullah.
[491.32] Brother-in-law.
[493.16] Congratulations.
[502.84] Brother Abdullah,
where are you taking away sister now?
[505.16] The groom's side is larger in number.
[507.28] And you're taking two
more soldiers off our team.
[509.36] Oh good lord!
[510.84] You should think before you speak.
[514.32] With God's grace,
the wedding was a success.
[516.64] That's it.
[518.08] Neither my wife nor my daughter
needs to watch the rest of the spectacle.
[521.64] Come on.
[523.96] Sister...
[530.64] What happened?
[532.00] Brother-in-law is unbelievable.
[533.56] He's taking sister away.
[535.96] He claims they have no reason
to stay when the wedding's over.
[539.20] This isn't done.
[542.24] That brother-in-law...
[544.24] He is impossible.
[547.20] This is a mess.
[548.44] No way!
[550.84] No, no, no!
[553.00] We will never settle for less than that.
[555.52] Never!
[556.96] Wait a minute.
[557.72] Wait a minute.
[558.72] Our lioness has arrived on the scene.
[560.96] Now let's see how the guys don't pay up.
[568.08] You won't get a penny.
[572.32] Why not?
[573.76] Sisters-in-law have a
right to their brother-in-law.
[579.36] So...who has a right to sisters-in-law?
[583.24] The brother-in-law's friends of course.
[587.40] She's embarrassed.
[589.32] Come on, quickly finish the ritual,
[593.48] or we'll have to force your hand.
[597.12] Say something Umaina,
[599.28] they are being impossible.
[600.92] If anyone has a right to him,
then speak now.
[605.96] After this, you'll get nothing.
[610.36] Don't argue with them, girls.
[612.44] They are in no position
to give us our rights.
[617.68] Don't be under any illusion, ladies.
[621.52] And better put your lioness on a leash.
[625.32] She is in no position to throw tantrums.
[631.16] What are you doing, Umaina?
[632.80] We don't want to start a fight.
We just want money.
[635.24] We're fine, bro.
[636.04] What's the matter?
[637.52] What happened, Umaina?
[638.64] Welcome, Madam Shameem.
[642.52] What's your share in this ritual?
[648.92] We don't want anything
[650.60] from guys who don't know how to talk
to girls.
[653.20] Come on, Umi.
[656.24] Yay!
[657.72] Madam Chand!
[659.52] Come on, this isn't right.
[661.32] No fighting.
[662.24] Let's perform the rituals gently.
[665.32] Come on, Mr.
Groom, you'll be drinking the milk later.
[668.84] There's no harm in drinking it now.
[671.20] What's wrong with you?
[673.12] What are you saying?
[675.84] I mean pay for the ritual.
It's a tradition.
[681.96] Gulp it down.  It's all yours.
[692.08] Umi, drink some water.
[696.92] You haven't eaten anything either.
[698.96] It's not wise to starve in this condition.
[701.64] Shall I get dinner for you?
[705.00] Come on, Umi.  Take it.
[818.36] Are you looking for admission, sister?
[819.84] Do you have a problem?
[821.84] Awesome.
[834.92] You're back again.
[836.96] Ma'am, I want to meet Umaina.
[840.84] Well, you certainly
didn't come to meet me.
[844.04] She doesn't want to meet you.
[845.84] This completely slipped my mind.
[850.36] I brought a special
betel leaf from Vigo Chowk.
[855.76] They are popular.
[856.96] You'll like them.  Try them.
[861.20] Fine, I'll keep them.
But you still can't meet her.
[867.44] Oh, God.  That's a nice
shade of lipstick you've put on.
[875.08] You should use only this shade.
[876.80] It suits you.  It makes you look adorable.
[882.76] Please.
[885.24] Please.
[886.28] Everything is under your control.
[891.44] This case is not under my control.
[893.96] There's nothing I can do.
[896.80] Because she doesn't want to meet you.
[902.16] By the way,
[904.96] what's going on between you two?
[907.44] She looks pretty upset these days.
[909.96] She was always so lively.
[912.32] What blew her fuse?
[914.40] She is upset.
[917.16] She pretends to be strong on the inside.
[920.24] But she isn't.
[921.32] She's very soft on the inside,
like cotton.
[926.12] Please let me meet her once, madam.
[930.04] Fine, I'll try again if you insist.
[935.88] But remember, this is your last chance.
[941.60] No more opportunities after this.
[943.40] Okay.
[944.00] Don't come back again.
[1037.40] Shameem.
[1039.36] Shameem.
[1042.08] Get up.
[1044.84] Where did you come from?
[1047.08] Come with me.
[1047.84] Where?
[1048.72] Are you coming along or not?
[1049.96] Wait, let me snap back to my senses.
[1052.36] How did you come here so suddenly?
[1054.48] Shouldn't I?
[1055.64] That's not what I meant.
[1057.68] Last time you refused to see me.
[1059.44] I've been wandering around
your hostel like a madman.
[1062.08] And now you want me to
be at your beck and call.
[1064.32] Shameem, I am going.
[1065.24] Fine, your threats don't scare me.
[1071.16] Umi.
[1074.20] Umi.
[1078.48] Umi.
[1090.40] What is this place, Umi?
[1094.60] Isn't this Bilal's...
[1097.96] What are you going to do?
[1099.44] For God's sake, don't do anything stupid.
[1102.88] What choice do I have?
[1105.08] I come here every night.
Spend hours out here.
[1108.12] But cannot muster the
courage to walk up to him.
[1110.92] I keep crying with the
hope that he hears me, but...
[1117.96] I am so furious.
[1119.88] I'll be right back.
[1123.92] I do too.
[1125.56] Even I feel angry.
[1128.28] But what's the point?
It ruined everything between us.
[1132.68] He doesn't even want to
hear my voice anymore.
[1134.88] You won't yell at him.
[1135.76] I am furious at you, not him.
[1143.96] You should.
[1146.68] You know everyone was right.
[1149.48] I was very arrogant.
[1152.48] Full of air.
I wonder what I thought of myself.
[1157.52] I never imagined someone
could ignore me like this.
[1160.40] Dump me.
[1163.44] Took him less than a minute.
[1165.96] Shameem, I am such a fool.
[1171.04] Why are you doing this to yourself?
[1175.16] Your condition is beginning to scare me.
[1179.04] The world is a tough place.
[1181.80] They will prey on you like
scavengers if you fall weak.
[1185.64] I have nothing more to offer.
[1189.52] Look at my condition.
[1191.84] I am sitting outside his house,
sobbing, pining.
[1197.48] Even God would melt at my condition,
[1199.04] why doesn't he, Shameem.
[1200.48] Because he's deaf and blind
[1202.36] He doesn't know your worth.
[1204.20] And you're crazy to compare him with God.
[1207.48] He isn't God.
[1209.72] What a cheap and disgusting person.
[1214.44] You're crazy to fall
in love with a man like him.
[1221.32] Why are you doing this to yourself?
[1227.20] Do you even know what love is?
[1231.84] Have you ever been in love?
[1234.32] If you've ever fallen in love,
you'll know what desire feels like.
[1240.12] Yes, he is my God.
[1244.12] I vested my fate in his hands.
[1247.48] He can ruin it or fill it with joy.
[1253.52] It's him, Shameem.  Only him.
[1257.96] No one else.
[1264.88] Then why are you sitting here and crying?
[1267.76] Go on,
[1269.20] and rub your nose on his threshold.
[1271.88] Yell, scream, and tell everyone...
[1279.76] Where are you going?
[1281.72] What are you doing?
[1282.52] The thing you brought me here for.
[1285.16] I will tell him to accept you.
[1286.92] And if he doesn't,
[1288.00] then I'll gather the
entire neighborhood around.
[1289.84] He must face the same
embarrassment which he caused you.
[1291.92] - Shameem, you won't do anything.
- Leave me.
[1293.20] - For my sake, Shameem.
- Leave me.
[1295.04] - I beg you, Shameem.
- Leave me.
[1296.56] - He's already angry with me.
- Umi.
[1298.00] - Umi.
- Shameem, please.
[1299.24] - Umi.
- It was a mistake.
[1301.24] - Umi.
- Shameem, please...
[1303.52] - Leave me.
- He's already angry with me.
[1305.32] Don't make a scene here.  Get in.
[1308.56] What are you waiting for?
[1309.52] Drive.
[1310.76] Fine.
[1313.76] Let's go.
[1314.76] Let's go.
[1317.16] Let me talk to him.
[1348.60] Umi.
[1357.00] Shall we?
[1463.00] Umi.
[1465.00] Where do you think you're going?
[1466.64] This is a girls' hostel.
[1468.00] I want to meet Umi.  It's important.
[1470.00] She's gone.
[1472.44] Gone where?
[1473.32] She's gone home to Jhelum.
[1476.08] What's going on here?
[1477.72] When did she leave?
[1479.08] Just now.
[1480.16] What's going on?
[1483.96] Strange people.
They walk in as if they belong here.
[1537.44] What are you doing here?
[1540.44] I won't let you go alone.
[1541.88] I'll drop you home.
[1544.40] I know how to protect myself, Shameem,
[1546.16] I don't need any favors from you.
[1547.40] Leave.
[1548.84] I know how you protect yourself.
[1551.40] If you really did,
[1552.36] then you wouldn't be in this condition.
[1553.76] Will you leave or do I create a scene?
[1555.36] Go ahead.  Yell, scream, create a scene.
[1559.12] Do what you like?  I don't care a damn.
[1566.12] You're going to look after me.
[1567.92] You?
[1569.44] Learn to protect yourself first.
[1571.64] He wants to protect me.
[1573.48] Why are you trying to imply?
[1575.04] Eunuch.
[1578.48] Say what you like?
[1580.28] But you can't get rid of me so easily.
[1582.96] Shameem, I'm already on the edge,
[1584.60] so stop bothering me.  I
[1587.16] know you're worried about me,
[1589.52] but there's nothing you can do for me.
[1591.88] So leave me to my condition,
[1593.08] I don't want false assurances.
[1594.88] Don't follow me.
[1646.80] Humans are very uncaring.
[1650.08] They never take notice
of those close to them.
[1661.08] And they drive themselves
crazy for those who aren't around.
[1671.32] Shameem was my being my protective layer,
and I was ignoring him.
[1677.28] And I was driving myself
crazy for the one who stripped me.
[1708.72] Stop here.
[1711.16] Right here.
[1733.20] Are you done guarding me?
[1735.08] I've reached home.
[1735.84] Do you want to get
me thrown out of here too?
[1737.88] Someone will steal your scooter.
[1739.16] Go back to Lahore.
[1740.12] But--
[1751.96] Harm...
[1754.04] Harmful.
[1758.00] Dust...
[1761.92] Dusty.
[1765.20] Nation...
[1769.28] - No, child.  It's national.
- Greetings, father.
[1807.36] Sister, you came home.
[1810.44] Hmm.
[1812.60] Are you going to stay here permanently?
[1816.48] Yes.
[1817.88] But this is my room.
[1820.56] I know.  Nothing around here is mine.
[1824.08] What are you staring at?
[1826.28] Don't you understand what I said?
[1827.72] Go away.
[1832.20] How did you turn up so suddenly?
[1834.16] You could've at least informed us.
[1836.20] This house belongs to my father.
Why should I inform?
[1838.64] Yes, this is your father's house.
[1841.00] But your father doesn't live here alone.
[1843.08] His wife and children live here too.
[1845.24] And this house belongs to them more.
[1847.28] The hostel is undergoing minor repairs.
[1848.68] Everyone went home.
Where else could I go?
[1851.40] It's only a matter of a few days.
I'll leave soon.
[1855.36] Why are you arguing with her?
[1857.88] She said she'll leave in a couple of days.
[1861.04] Prepare some food.
[1862.20] I am not feeling well.
[1864.04] Order something.
[2004.60] 'Try later or...'
[2017.12] Bilal, please don't ignore me.
[2018.92] I know you're getting my calls.
[2021.64] I am very anxious.  Please help me.
[2024.76] I vomit anything I eat.
How long can I hide it?
[2028.92] Someday everyone will find out.
[2031.56] Tell me what to do.
[2033.56] Please reply to me, Bilal.
[2053.64] I'm telling you something isn't right.
[2058.32] My dear,
[2059.96] you can see I've returned tired from work.
[2061.64] Let me eat in peace.
[2072.32] Umaina dear, come here.
[2080.08] I am not hungry.
[2082.60] We need to talk.
[2096.48] Sit down, child.
[2105.60] I've finished my food, mom.
[2113.60] I don't know how to
say this to my daughter.
[2120.24] Razia was saying that,
[2127.68] she believes...
[2130.80] Your wife is right.
[2133.08] I am pregnant.
[2136.00] Get out of my house!
[2137.92] We don't know you anymore!
[2140.00] Get out.
[2141.00] You're no one to us!
[2142.68] I'll get rid of everything
that belongs to you!
[2145.56] Get lost, you scoundrel!
[2147.72] Like mother, like daughter!  [ __ ]!
[2150.76] Don't you dare speak ill of my mother...
[2153.08] What?
[2154.32] What?
[2155.48] Threatening me.  Abusing me.
[2157.56] Aren't you ashamed one bit?
[2158.60] She's abusing me and my dead mother!
[2162.20] If you really loved me,
then why let me go?
[2164.64] Why didn't you protect me?
[2166.56] You brought her home
while my mother was dying.
[2169.04] She was on her deathbed.
Couldn't you show some patience?
[2171.92] You destroyed my childhood
by forcing me into a hostel,
[2174.96] for her sake!
[2176.44] And now you're showing your manliness.
[2177.84] Shame on you!
[2179.68] You can keep her and her child.
[2181.80] And lick them!
[2182.88] - Get out!
- Leave me.
[2184.72] - Get out!
- I'm going.
[2186.60] Get lost!
[2188.88] Don't ever set foot in this house again!
[2201.00] Umaina.
[2204.44] Yes, ma'am.
[2206.52] What's going on?
[2208.68] What?
[2210.00] Your mother called.
[2218.56] First of all, ma'am, she isn't my mother.
[2221.28] She won't let me die in peace.
[2223.40] We are no longer related.
[2225.48] I don't care.
[2228.52] Are you really?
[2238.56] Listen Umaina, you cannot stay here.
[2242.64] You must leave quietly.
[2246.20] But where will I go, ma'am?
[2249.48] I don't know where.
[2253.96] But you can't stay here.
[2256.04] Leave immediately.
[2260.48] I've paid a year's fee.
So no one can throw me out.
[2265.44] Your father paid the fee.
[2267.80] And he's having you thrown out.
[2272.04] Umaina, for your own sake, leave quietly.
[2277.60] Don't force me to call the guards.
[2281.40] I said go!
