Why isn't anyone answering the phone? Who is it? Wait. Hello. Hello. Who is it? Why don't you speak? Look, I am already quite troubled. Who... Shammo. Hello. Hello. Who was it? Shammo. Must be Shammo. I know it. What have I done? God, what have I done? Why did I... Why did you go away? Come back Shammo. Come back Shammo.
For God's sake, come back. Bay ji. Oh, God. You... Come here. My son. Shammo. Where were you? Where were you?  Where were you? My son. Did someone... ...say something to you? Where were you? Come here. Come here. Come sit here.  Come sit here. Come, my son. Come sit here. No one will dare to say anything to you. No one will. Shammo. This shouldn't have happened,
Shameem. Humaira. Humaira. The one you're crying
for is back dear. Get up and give him a hug. Get up, dear.  Come on. How will I face him, Bay ji? His parents entrusted him to me, and I couldn't take care of him. No, dear.  Don't say that. Don't say that. You took such good care of him. Get up, dear.  Come on. He's waiting outside for you. Come on, let's go. I can't fill in his mother's shoes. Keep him away from me, Bay ji. No, no, no. - I can never be a good mother.
- No, no, no.  Don't say that. Don't say that. Listen to me. You don't listen to me. A mother is just a mother. She is neither good nor bad. Very naughty. You called. Listen, son. Make the same meat dish
you made for me the other day. Okay. Do you know why? My family is visiting me. And my wife hasn't been talking to me, ever since she came here. So before she makes me spend a fortune, cook that delicious
meat dish again. Okay. Listen, why are you in a bad mood? I hope you too haven't
fought with your wife. Don't worry.  I know. The best way to keep a wife busy
is by making her take care of the kids. They keep them so occupied
that they can't think of anything else. Wait a minute, I'm getting a call. Send five kilos of meat. What can I say, madam, my in-laws have been
literally torturing me. On the other hand is my husband, who can't take me to the city. He says I don't have money
to buy a house in the city. Will I let you stay with my friends? Imagine, madam. But I've made a decision, madam. I'll tell you. This time I've made up my mind. Once he returns from the city... Seems like I'm talking
to myself, madam. Madam, where are you lost? Did you tell, sir? He'll be very happy. What will we do now, Shameem? What can I say? I don't understand. It's not my fault. I'm not blaming you. You haven't said a
word since you found out. I am not silent... ...just worried. This is nothing like
we had planned. It's terrible, isn't it? I don't know what I should be
feeling right now. I do n't know. Sometimes I want to be sad, or worried, or elated. Elated? How can you be happy? And in the current situation? I know. Do you know, Umi, everyone made fun of me. They said you can
never become a father. And honestly speaking
I began to realize, that I can never become a father. Bay ji would have been so happy. Shameem. I think we've been
unfair to Ali. Ali. Ali, wait. Eat your food, Ali. Ali. Son, eat your food. Fine. I'm sitting right here. The floor is so dirty, my clothes are completely soiled. And I am also starving. But it doesn't matter. I won't eat until you don't eat. I am right here. What do I say,
madam, they beat me up! Was it your husband? No, he hasn't returned
for a long time now. It was my in-laws.
They are cruel people. They snatch my money
and also beat me up. They are very cruel people. Why don't you tell your husband? I do.  I've told him several times. He says why can't you be patient. How much more patient
can I be, madam? How much more? Being a married woman, I'm living like a widow. I can't be patient anymore. I cannot. Be quiet.  Stop crying. Or else I will kill you. Be quiet. Be quiet or else I will beat you. - I will kill you.
- Shabana.  What are you doing? - I will kill you.
- What are you doing? - Leave me, madam.
- Have you lost your mind? He is the root of all problems. He is the root of all problems. - I will kill you.
- Don't touch him.  Stay back. - I will kill you.
- Shabana.  Stay back. Lord. You don't let me live or die. You are so cruel, Lord. Why do you make us so helpless, Lord? Why do you bless poor
people with children? Hello. Hello, is this HIV
positive helpline. Welcome to the HIV and AIDS helpline. I...am an HIV patient
and so is my wife. We needed information. Please ask. What would you like to know? We'll help you in any way we can. Actually, my wife is pregnant... Umi, Abbasi sir is a strange man. He was staring at me weirdly. But I know he will fire me. But you don't have to worry. God will help me find a job just
like he helped me find this one. By the way, I have all
the information on the child. They say if it's an HIV pregnancy we're not giving birth
to this child. We've already ruined one life. I don't have the
strength to ruin another. - But Umi-
- I'll get an abortion. I haven't said
anything we don't want. I just said it first. Eat your food. If I knew you'd be such an uncouth
when you grew up, I would've strangled
you in the cradle. Stop it. Nothing is lost yet, father. Strangle me. It's for you to decide. I've lived my life. But no more, shameless! See...look at her foul language. She is talking rubbish!
She accuses me! Stop it! You two have ruined my life. I told you, I will support you if he's wrong. But he's right. I've personally met their family. They are very nice people. Must be like him. Far better than me. Let's forget the past. It cannot be fixed. Make your own destiny
and leave for good. You don't have to see
our wretched faces again. Leave. Fine. What do you mean fine? Call them over.  You have my approval. What? But how? Congratulations.  She's ready. Stop worrying about how. Maybe God gave her some sense. I hope. Congratulations, sister-in-law, my son likes your daughter. Congratulations to you too. Even we like your family a lot. Being from such an affluent family, you people are so decent and humble. Otherwise,
we have no comparison at all. Let's not talk about any comparison. Brother Abdullah's honesty and integrity
are unmatched in the entire market. That's what brought
me to your threshold. And as for Fatima is concerned, I am sure she must be religious
just like her father. What more can we ask for? I am not like my father. I am honest like him. Fatima... No, let her speak.
Go on, dear. My father has never done a bad deal. He never gave any bad
product to a customer. Of course. And I am witness to this, child. Shouldn't he show the same responsibility
when it comes to relationships? Ask him is he being dishonest
with you about his daughter? Is he betraying you? Fatima. Tell him, father. Tell him about my flaws. And be honest. Fatima! My daughter is right. If I am honest in
every aspect of life, then I must be honest
about my daughter too. My daughter has flaws, Sheikh sir. She's been raped. Not once but several times. And I am to be blamed for it. She always said I don't
want to go back, father. They are not good people. But I would take her back anyway. I used to feel that she was the devil. I was arrogant about myself, that I'm one of God's
most liked people. God always listens to me. And often my word was God's will. I didn't know that
it would be my fault. I am my daughter's culprit. No one else, not even God. Only me. My decisions did
this to my daughter! Forgive me, child! Forgive me! Forgive me! I came to apologize
to you Abbasi sir. but please don't fire me. I need this job. I had a cousin. My aunt's son. He was my best friend, my buddy. When many locals started
moving out for better prospects, he said he'll do the same. "I'll make a lot of money there," " then we'll both build
a huge hotel in" He wanted to make a lot of money. Big car, big house. He came back. He came back. But not with money, with this AIDS. But Abbasi sir, I did no such thing. Hear me out first. These cruel people didn't
let me bury him here. He was my best friend. I couldn't do anything for him. I was scared. I regretted it later. Listen. You're a great guy. Don't tell anyone or
they will throw you out. I can understand your helplessness,
Abbasi sir. Don't worry, we'll leave. Hear me out first, you fool. I couldn't do anything for him. I was scared. I regretted it later. But I will do for you. It'll help me clear my mind. And my friend might forgive me. Don't tell anyone about this. Thank you very much. Whatever life I have left
I will be indebted to you. Thank you? If you want to repay the debt then, don't forget this Abbasi. Pray for me. Go.  Leave. Go now.  I don't want you to see me cry. Leave. Okay. But why, madam? Will you help me or not? Good Lord, spare me. - Shabana.
- Good Lord, spare me. - I have no one except for you.
- This is a sin, madam.  It's a sin. God wants to bring
him into this world, - how can I take away his life?
- You were trying to kill your own child. It was only in a fit of rage. Imagine I am in a fit of rage too. Please help me. Don't be stubborn, madam. Years later you'll
be blessed with a child, you'll be blessed with God's grace. If it's anything sir said, then I'll explain to him. Why don't you understand that
we cannot give birth to this child? That's what I'm asking,
madam, what's the problem? Problem! The problem is that
I am going to die! Umi. Umi, have you lost your mind? You make it sound like you've
known her for several years. She said she's a midwife.
She has handled many cases. And you believed her. You haven't seen anyone
help in childbirth yourself. Do we have any other option? No, we can go to the hospital. Have you lost your mind? We both know this is illegal. Someone will help us out. If not out of sympathy
then at least for money. And then what? They will conduct tests
on me and find out I have AIDS. Does anyone accept this disease? We don't have many options. Madam, think about it again. It's a risk to your life. Come early in the morning. I'll be ready. Hey. Why did you throw it away?
It's so cute. I don't want it. It's fine, if you don't want it. But that doesn't make it useless. It's so cute. Listen... You think your parents
gave you to me, because they think you're useless. I am the useless one, everyone would discard me. That makes us even. Can I ask you a question? You felt bad that your
father gave you to me. But the truth is, he actually entrusted me to you. So what now?
Won't you take care of me? Will you discard me as well? Well... can I go? And take him too? Okay. Umi. What if something happens to you? Then I won't have any complaints. It's a good thing. I don't want to see you die. How unfair? You didn't think about me. I did... But like you always say
that Umi you're very selfish. I am. It's a good thing if I die first. I don't want to wallow
in the pain of your separation. Sir, please listen to me. No more discussions. Shameem, go outside. I said go outside! Go outside! They say that a mother's womb
is the safest place for a child. But my womb gave
birth to only bad luck. First Ali and now him. He would be born with AIDS. Endure illness and people's
rejection for the rest of his life. From those we ran away from. But Mrs.  Shameem, you've
always explained to Mr.  Shameem, that parents can do
anything for their children. But they can't be their God. But after hearing your
statement it sounds like, You've decided that
child's destiny as his god. Before life could have rejected him, his own parents rejected him. Like Ali. Wait! Wait! Go away.
We don't want to do anything. What are you doing? - Umi, there is no need for this.
- She won't leave. Shameem, I said go. I'll lose my courage.
I have convinced myself... - ...with great difficulty.
- Go away. - You should go.
- Listen. - Don't do it.
- Everything will be fine.  You have me. I'll lose my courage, Shameem. This is wrong. I said go! Umi, I know you're angry with me. But what we're doing is wrong. I don't want any lectures. I know why you did it? Why? He's your child. Your child. Otherwise, you would have felt
the same pain while leaving Ali. The truth is you never
accepted Ali as your child. It was just a favor you did to him. Favor? You think I did a favor on Ali. You mean I don't love Ali.
Don't love him as my son. You left him in the garbage. All these years I
showered my love on him. - You're a great man and I am a wretch.
- Please. Once again you saved
a life from this monster. Shut up. You don't know what you're saying. I will say it.
I'll scream at the top of my voice. You should've stuck
to the decision we made. And if you loved him so much, then you should've stayed
away from that Tony. He disappeared himself
and made our lives hell. I am thinking ill of my own child today. You're saying this out
of disappointment, aren't you? What's left except for
disappointment and despair? Getting pregnant in
these conditions is a sign. What sign? We may be disappointed with life, but life isn't disappointed with us. Look, we have cried
and suffered our share. Look at the brighter side of life. I wonder what else
life wants from us. Listen to me. Listen to me. Everything will be fine.
