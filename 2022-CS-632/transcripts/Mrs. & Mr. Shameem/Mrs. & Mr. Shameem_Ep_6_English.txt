Be well again, my child. I'll be dead if
anything happens to you. God bless you. Why do you take on a
responsibility you can't handle? Give him to me. No, I will take care of him. Leave me alone. Are you angry? Will you not listen, even for him? Give me. I said give me. Don't you get it? Calm down.  Calm down.
Oh, he spat some milk out. Look at him. God bless you! Mercy comes with a price. How is it possible, Bay ji? To show mercy one must
be cruel to oneself. No wonder people
never show any mercy. You have to kill your ego. Rules have to be broken. It makes you do many
disgusting things. This is not disgusting, Bay ji. You're right. He's a human being as well. But I am not cruel either, Shammo. I love you. I love you so much. I will endure even this pain for you. I am your mother after all. That's exactly how
much I love him, Bay ji. You've a very kind heart, Shammo. Very pious, son. But remember,
good deeds should not be wasted. Do you have any clue
about the consequences? Good deeds are never
done with a biased mind. As you say, the real reward of good
deeds is the consequences. I will endure whatever the
consequences are for Ali's sake. - For someone else's child-
- He's not someone else's child! He's mine. Ali is mine alone.
Not even Umi's. Not Umi's. He's my son.  Only mine. Right?  You are mine, aren't you? These will make a few pairs for him. Okay. It's soft. Beautiful. He will wear it. This is too small. What is this, Bay ji? Will you accept him? Even after you know the truth. If we shower him
with love and comfort, maybe God will bless
my child with happiness too. When God bestowed upon him life, who are we to deprive him of it? Water. Fatima, get some
water for your father. I've said a dozen times,
I want water with my food. But does anyone understand? And what kind of bread is this? Do I have to teach you now? Are you blind? Can't you see where you're going?
You've ruined my clothes! What has your mother taught you?
What did she teach you? Don't scold the poor thing. She's still a kid.  You scare him. She's even afraid of
getting close to you now. Good.  Father and daughter
need to maintain distance. And stop lecturing me all the time. Haven't you seen your family's deed? And your brother, showers his love on
an illegitimate child. Disgusting. He's a better person than you, who treats his own child
like she's illegitimate. - What did you say?
- Nothing. - What did you say?
- Nothing. I didn't hear properly. - Say it.  Say it.
- I said nothing. - Well...
- What's making you so audacious? How dare you?
How dare you? No! I don't want to hear
your voice!  Quiet! Ali is so fortunate to
have a father like Shameem. If he's fortunate then what
does it mean to be unfortunate? I'll tell you what
being unfortunate is. Revering her husband. Following his every order,
every word. And yet see no mercy
for herself and her child, in her husband's heart. You should value Shameem. Calm down, my child. We're late today. Come on, Umi, let's hurry up. Let's go inside. You know she makes
us sit for two hours. I get tired of
sitting for that long. Come on, get up. Umi. Come on, let's go inside. Take me home,
Shameem, I don't want to be here. It will only take
a couple of minutes... I want to go home.
I don't want to see the doctor. Take me home. Umi... Don't insist,
Shameem, let's go home. Good boy... Good boy... Shameem. Hmm? Do you love me? Hmm. Say it out loud. Do you love me? Why do you ask? I love you a lot. What can you do for me? I won't make any claims. But I love you a lot. Can you kill him for my sake? Umi. What did I say wrong? Is it difficult? Take a closer look, doesn't he look like Bilal. Same eyes, same smile. - Don't you see Bilal in him?
- There's no such thing. No Bilal. He's like him. Kill him. Kill him, Shameem. I can never move
forward if he's around. You want me to love you? Don't you want me to love you? Kill him. - Kill him.
- You've lost your mind! Move. You can't kill him. I will kill him. I am his mother. - I won't let you do anything like that.
- Move aside. - I will strangle him.  Out of my way!
- Don't be crazy. Shameem, out of my way.
I will not spare him! Don't be crazy. Why are you interfering? He's my child.  I'll decide
whether to keep him or not. Whether I want him or not.
I will strangle him.  Leave me. Leave me. - Enough!
- Leave me, Shameem. Leave me. Leave me. Enough! I don't want this child,
Shameem, leave me. Okay, fine. I know you're right, but... We'll lose a good
proposal because of you. I'll talk to them
if I have your approval. Enough.  "I'll talk to them."
Stop pushing me. Give me time to think.  Calm down. I wanted to discuss
this with you last night, I couldn't control myself. I came straight here after
dropping Fatima at school. Listen to me... Sit down, take a breath.
I am talking to you. Slow down, haste is never good. Let me ask Wajeeha first. Whether she agrees or disagrees
to marry such an old man. Wajeeha and you have
a lot of tantrums, Bay ji. First, you show concern
when there are no proposals, or you start finding faults with the ones that
come. And what's the age difference? He's only 15 years older than her. Even Abdullah and
I are 10 years apart. Abdullah is what worries me. He's Abdullah's cousin,
they might have the same habits. Us and them are poles apart. We belong to different schools of thought. What if he treats
my daughter the same way? Umi. Umi. A person should be
well versed with reality. Have you seen her nature? She has no face or skills. It would be a miracle
if she gets along with someone. What's wrong with her face? What's wrong with her face? She looks like her father. I vent out your father's anger on her. I sometimes say some harsh things to her. Don't you look like
your father a little? Anyway, she isn't
as beautiful as Umaina, to find a lover
like brother Shameem. Umi. Bay ji, have you seen Umi? Even Ali is not in his room. We'll check for Umi later... Umi. - Listen to me...
- Umi. - Listen to me...
- Umi. She's brought a marriage
proposal for Wajeeha. What is your opinion? Bay ji, I am worried about them? I wonder where they are.  Umi. Look at him, Rukhsana, he's lost his mind because
of Umaina and her child. Earlier he was so concerned
about his sisters. Such love and care for her.
And now it's all for her child. Umaina is far luckier than us. Our husbands don't care
whether we live or die. Anyway, there's no point
in cursing our destiny. Do I say yes or no? What is your problem? I told you she didn't come here. Stop chasing after me. Where else could she go if not here? Shameem,
I don't care if she goes to hell. Understand.
Move. Give me a cigarette. Yes, you're right.  You don't care. She was madly in love with you, but why would you care
about her condition. She risked her life for you,
but you wouldn't care. Listen to me, save this speech for someone else. She's responsible
for her own consequences. I gave her a nice offer. She did the right thing, by not accepting
your humiliating offer.  Did she do the right thing? By the way, what did you do? You gave her respect. And what did she do with it? She ran away. Now get lost. Listen, if anything happens
to her or her child, then... Then? Then? Save whatever little
manliness you have, for the one who betrayed
you and eloped with someone else! Understand. Now get lost. I'm tired of seeing your face. Get lost! Get lost! Get lost! He's spoiled my mood.
Give me a cigarette. Get lost! Humaira. Humaira. Where the hell are you? Get me my shirt. The red one. Humaira. Humaira. What are you looking for, Humaira?
Will you tell me? Did you find it? Thank God.
Thank God.  Thank God.  Thank God. My gold chain. I can't find my gold chain, Bay ji. I told you she didn't take anything, except for her child. She didn't even take her luggage. God help her. She didn't take her belongings,
but she took my gold chain. This is always the case with me. - What's wrong with her?
- Someone's always interrupting my wedding. Oh, God!  Did she steal
something from her too? Listen to me carefully, if I don't get married
this time I'll jump off the roof. If anyone creates
hurdles in my marriage, Calm this witch down, Humaira. - I will commit suicide.
- I said go calm her down. When we were flooded with marriage proposals
for her she refused to entertain them, and now when they stopped coming,
she is creating a scene over it. Then why did you say no? You should have accepted the proposal. Really, Humaira?  Why did I say no? What would we say when they'd ask
where's Umaina and her child? Hey you ugly face,
don't you dare, you cockeyed... I am telling you, Humaira, she won't stop until she's
killed her mother. She is right, Bay ji. You should have accepted the proposal. We could've said that
Umaina is visiting her parents. Not again. And what about your brother, who is wandering around
looking for her? Who is going to stop him? Who will call him back? It's all the child's fault. They can't handle him. The thief even took my gold chain. She took the key and the chain. It's all my fault. I am doomed. So much has happened
and she is worried about her chain. Sir, his wife ran away. That was obvious. Look at your paunch. Not mine, sir, his wife ran away. Wasn't that obvious? File a report. How did she elope and with whom? And did she take anything with her? No, she did not elope. She is missing. She is sick. She also has a child. I am talking to you and
you are busy on the phone. Keep it down. Calm down. Don't try to teach us our job. There's a reason we're on this post. Leave it, sir.  I'll talk to him.
Don't worry, sir, don't worry. Come with me and file a report. Please, come with me. Umi...where were you? Tell me where were you? I am asking you a question.
Where were you? Move back, Shameem. Where is Ali? Umi... Umi, where is Ali? For God's sake, tell me where Ali is. Where is Ali? Where is my child? - Umi...
- Shameem, I am tired. Okay, fine.
But first, tell me where is Ali. Tell me. I said I am tired.  Leave me! They say every path leads somewhere. But for me,
life ended somewhere along the way. I was unaware of emotions like love,
care, humanity. I was completely numb. Leaving only hatred. The hatred that I was carrying
in my arms, starving and tired. I wanted to give punishment,
but to whom? To me, Bilal, the child, or Shameem? I didn't know. Am I looking nice? How about some tea? Sit. You've been awake the entire night.
I'll make some breakfast. Do you want some breakfast? Do I make for you too? What happened? What is it? Greetings, Bay ji. Greetings. Did you have breakfast? Er... Yes. This is for Shameem. See... She is behaving as if nothing happened. Ask her about the chain. Breakfast. Come on. I don't want to eat. I am asking you something.  Where is Ali? Have some breakfast,
I made it especially for you. Or should I make
something else for you? I am asking you something.
I want an answer. Where did you leave him? Ali who? Our son. We haven't had any children yet. Don't be mad.
Come on, let's have breakfast. Look Umi, don't test my patience. - Otherwise-
- Otherwise what? I said we haven't had
any children yet. And you can forget all about Ali. What are you saying? This is completely unfair. I'm hungry. Let's have breakfast. Fine. Don't tell me if you don't want to. I'll find him from wherever he is. I will find out. Sir, please... Please help me. Do something, please. Your wife returned on her own, and you made us run around
the entire city. She must have hidden him somewhere. No, she didn't bring
the child back with her. Maybe she killed the
child and hid the body. Did she get into any kind of fight, or an affair? No, no, I swear that's not the case. We'll find out soon. You can't hide it from the Police. Naveed, do one thing. Go with him. Where? He'll tell you. Every year we find
several bodies of children, some in the dumpster,
others under a rock. Rascals commit the crime,
and punish the child for it. We found three dead bodies today. Come take a look,
maybe your child's among them. We recovered one of
them from a pile of trash. And the other one... Did you propose Majid's
name for Wajeeha? No, not me.  It was Hamida. Couldn't you have told me? I thought maybe she
already had a word with you. I am never informed about
anything going on in this house. You want to ruin what
little family honor I have, with your family's obnoxious ways. Wajeeha is a nice girl. I see...
And what about your sister-in-law? I heard she left
her child somewhere. Witch... How could she not
take mercy on her child? She did the right thing by leaving him. No one wanted him anyway. You said I... Don't make me look so cruel. What's done was done. He was a child after all.
She could've shown some mercy. Anyway, keep my family
away from your family's obnoxious ways. Tell them no. Sometimes even I
want to sacrifice myself. What are you blabbering about? Nothing. Water. Is it okay? Did you find him? Yes, I did. Here he is. Here he is. Here he is. This is what you wanted to see? Here's more.  And more! You want a child? Do you? Yes. Here you go. Do it. First Bilal now you. You want a child, don't you? You'll get it. But forget him.
