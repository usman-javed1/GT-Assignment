I told you! I told you I won't like this dress... ... yet you forced me to wear it! You're looking pretty decent.
Stop complaining. They had it stitched for
you out of love and compassion. But your whining doesn't seem to end. You're going to stir things up. From what angle does it look nice? From what angle does this dress look nice? I look so ugly and
overweight in this dress. I'm not going to the wedding! You can go alone! You're always making faces,
always complaining. You never like anything...
Never... Bay ji...stop it! No one likes to argue all the time. - Shammo, I was only... -
Please, I don't need your help. What's the matter, Choti?
Why are you worried? Look, brother, Allah gave
me all the flaws of mom and dad. And now this dress. I don't want to wear this dress. I won't go to the wedding.
You guys can go. Okay, fine. Take off the dress.
I'll get you another one. Come on, get up. And go. Go on. Forget it. Shammo. Look at me. Look at me! What's wrong? What is wrong? There are too many white flowers.
Add some more red flowers. Okay. Unbelievable. Hurry up. Babaji, let me see the plates. Are they clean? Clean them properly.  Did you hear? Umi. Umi. We need to talk. I'm in no mood to talk.  Leave. Shammo, there's definitely
something wrong here. I am not asking, I am telling you. Something isn't right. Something seems off. Look...
Not you. The guy that arrived last night... ...in the black suit and red jacket. There's something between him and her. I'm not talking in the air. I've been keeping an eye. I can tell how long a
girl has been spending time with the boy. I know. Who would know your ill
intentions better than me? Pay more attention to Humaira. She seems sad nowadays. You know how big my attention span is. There's adequate left
even after focusing on Humaira, which I then focus around me. When you have time, do tell her about my attention span. No time you say? Rascal! Dog! What are you looking at me for? Carry on. You look absolutely beautiful. Thank you, sweetheart. - The Bangles--
- Bay ji. Hello!  Welcome! Oh great! You left the girls alone? Oh, I see. Bay ji,
the wedding procession has arrived. Go on. Huh? - Shammo?
- Salma. Girls.  The wedding procession has arrived. The wedding procession... It has arrived. She's looking like such a sweetheart. What are you waiting here for? Don't you want to see
Salma's wedding procession Umaina? You're part of the family. Right? Absolutely right, Bay ji. And she's behaving like a guest. Come on, hurry up. Here. Go, have a look at the wedding procession. God save you from every evil eye. Hurry up. Congratulations, Bay ji. Oh. Congratulations. Congratulations. Hey... Brother. Congratulations. Congratulations, brother Abdullah. Brother-in-law. Congratulations. Brother Abdullah,
where are you taking away sister now? The groom's side is larger in number. And you're taking two
more soldiers off our team. Oh good lord! You should think before you speak. With God's grace,
the wedding was a success. That's it. Neither my wife nor my daughter
needs to watch the rest of the spectacle. Come on. Sister... What happened? Brother-in-law is unbelievable. He's taking sister away. He claims they have no reason
to stay when the wedding's over. This isn't done. That brother-in-law... He is impossible. This is a mess. No way! No, no, no! We will never settle for less than that. Never! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Our lioness has arrived on the scene. Now let's see how the guys don't pay up. You won't get a penny. Why not? Sisters-in-law have a
right to their brother-in-law. So...who has a right to sisters-in-law? The brother-in-law's friends of course. She's embarrassed. Come on, quickly finish the ritual, or we'll have to force your hand. Say something Umaina, they are being impossible. If anyone has a right to him,
then speak now. After this, you'll get nothing. Don't argue with them, girls. They are in no position
to give us our rights. Don't be under any illusion, ladies. And better put your lioness on a leash. She is in no position to throw tantrums. What are you doing, Umaina? We don't want to start a fight.
We just want money. We're fine, bro. What's the matter? What happened, Umaina? Welcome, Madam Shameem. What's your share in this ritual? We don't want anything from guys who don't know how to talk
to girls. Come on, Umi. Yay! Madam Chand! Come on, this isn't right. No fighting. Let's perform the rituals gently. Come on, Mr.
Groom, you'll be drinking the milk later. There's no harm in drinking it now. What's wrong with you? What are you saying? I mean pay for the ritual.
It's a tradition. Gulp it down.  It's all yours. Umi, drink some water. You haven't eaten anything either. It's not wise to starve in this condition. Shall I get dinner for you? Come on, Umi.  Take it. Are you looking for admission, sister? Do you have a problem? Awesome. You're back again. Ma'am, I want to meet Umaina. Well, you certainly
didn't come to meet me. She doesn't want to meet you. This completely slipped my mind. I brought a special
betel leaf from Vigo Chowk. They are popular. You'll like them.  Try them. Fine, I'll keep them.
But you still can't meet her. Oh, God.  That's a nice
shade of lipstick you've put on. You should use only this shade. It suits you.  It makes you look adorable. Please. Please. Everything is under your control. This case is not under my control. There's nothing I can do. Because she doesn't want to meet you. By the way, what's going on between you two? She looks pretty upset these days. She was always so lively. What blew her fuse? She is upset. She pretends to be strong on the inside. But she isn't. She's very soft on the inside,
like cotton. Please let me meet her once, madam. Fine, I'll try again if you insist. But remember, this is your last chance. No more opportunities after this. Okay. Don't come back again. Shameem. Shameem. Get up. Where did you come from? Come with me. Where? Are you coming along or not? Wait, let me snap back to my senses. How did you come here so suddenly? Shouldn't I? That's not what I meant. Last time you refused to see me. I've been wandering around
your hostel like a madman. And now you want me to
be at your beck and call. Shameem, I am going. Fine, your threats don't scare me. Umi. Umi. Umi. What is this place, Umi? Isn't this Bilal's... What are you going to do? For God's sake, don't do anything stupid. What choice do I have? I come here every night.
Spend hours out here. But cannot muster the
courage to walk up to him. I keep crying with the
hope that he hears me, but... I am so furious. I'll be right back. I do too. Even I feel angry. But what's the point?
It ruined everything between us. He doesn't even want to
hear my voice anymore. You won't yell at him. I am furious at you, not him. You should. You know everyone was right. I was very arrogant. Full of air.
I wonder what I thought of myself. I never imagined someone
could ignore me like this. Dump me. Took him less than a minute. Shameem, I am such a fool. Why are you doing this to yourself? Your condition is beginning to scare me. The world is a tough place. They will prey on you like
scavengers if you fall weak. I have nothing more to offer. Look at my condition. I am sitting outside his house,
sobbing, pining. Even God would melt at my condition, why doesn't he, Shameem. Because he's deaf and blind He doesn't know your worth. And you're crazy to compare him with God. He isn't God. What a cheap and disgusting person. You're crazy to fall
in love with a man like him. Why are you doing this to yourself? Do you even know what love is? Have you ever been in love? If you've ever fallen in love,
you'll know what desire feels like. Yes, he is my God. I vested my fate in his hands. He can ruin it or fill it with joy. It's him, Shameem.  Only him. No one else. Then why are you sitting here and crying? Go on, and rub your nose on his threshold. Yell, scream, and tell everyone... Where are you going? What are you doing? The thing you brought me here for. I will tell him to accept you. And if he doesn't, then I'll gather the
entire neighborhood around. He must face the same
embarrassment which he caused you. - Shameem, you won't do anything.
- Leave me. - For my sake, Shameem.
- Leave me. - I beg you, Shameem.
- Leave me. - He's already angry with me.
- Umi. - Umi.
- Shameem, please. - Umi.
- It was a mistake. - Umi.
- Shameem, please... - Leave me.
- He's already angry with me. Don't make a scene here.  Get in. What are you waiting for? Drive. Fine. Let's go. Let's go. Let me talk to him. Umi. Shall we? Umi. Where do you think you're going? This is a girls' hostel. I want to meet Umi.  It's important. She's gone. Gone where? She's gone home to Jhelum. What's going on here? When did she leave? Just now. What's going on? Strange people.
They walk in as if they belong here. What are you doing here? I won't let you go alone. I'll drop you home. I know how to protect myself, Shameem, I don't need any favors from you. Leave. I know how you protect yourself. If you really did, then you wouldn't be in this condition. Will you leave or do I create a scene? Go ahead.  Yell, scream, create a scene. Do what you like?  I don't care a damn. You're going to look after me. You? Learn to protect yourself first. He wants to protect me. Why are you trying to imply? Eunuch. Say what you like? But you can't get rid of me so easily. Shameem, I'm already on the edge, so stop bothering me.  I know you're worried about me, but there's nothing you can do for me. So leave me to my condition, I don't want false assurances. Don't follow me. Humans are very uncaring. They never take notice
of those close to them. And they drive themselves
crazy for those who aren't around. Shameem was my being my protective layer,
and I was ignoring him. And I was driving myself
crazy for the one who stripped me. Stop here. Right here. Are you done guarding me? I've reached home. Do you want to get
me thrown out of here too? Someone will steal your scooter. Go back to Lahore. But-- Harm... Harmful. Dust... Dusty. Nation... - No, child.  It's national.
- Greetings, father. Sister, you came home. Hmm. Are you going to stay here permanently? Yes. But this is my room. I know.  Nothing around here is mine. What are you staring at? Don't you understand what I said? Go away. How did you turn up so suddenly? You could've at least informed us. This house belongs to my father.
Why should I inform? Yes, this is your father's house. But your father doesn't live here alone. His wife and children live here too. And this house belongs to them more. The hostel is undergoing minor repairs. Everyone went home.
Where else could I go? It's only a matter of a few days.
I'll leave soon. Why are you arguing with her? She said she'll leave in a couple of days. Prepare some food. I am not feeling well. Order something. 'Try later or...' Bilal, please don't ignore me. I know you're getting my calls. I am very anxious.  Please help me. I vomit anything I eat.
How long can I hide it? Someday everyone will find out. Tell me what to do. Please reply to me, Bilal. I'm telling you something isn't right. My dear, you can see I've returned tired from work. Let me eat in peace. Umaina dear, come here. I am not hungry. We need to talk. Sit down, child. I've finished my food, mom. I don't know how to
say this to my daughter. Razia was saying that, she believes... Your wife is right. I am pregnant. Get out of my house! We don't know you anymore! Get out. You're no one to us! I'll get rid of everything
that belongs to you! Get lost, you scoundrel! Like mother, like daughter!  [ __ ]! Don't you dare speak ill of my mother... What? What? Threatening me.  Abusing me. Aren't you ashamed one bit? She's abusing me and my dead mother! If you really loved me,
then why let me go? Why didn't you protect me? You brought her home
while my mother was dying. She was on her deathbed.
Couldn't you show some patience? You destroyed my childhood
by forcing me into a hostel, for her sake! And now you're showing your manliness. Shame on you! You can keep her and her child. And lick them! - Get out!
- Leave me. - Get out!
- I'm going. Get lost! Don't ever set foot in this house again! Umaina. Yes, ma'am. What's going on? What? Your mother called. First of all, ma'am, she isn't my mother. She won't let me die in peace. We are no longer related. I don't care. Are you really? Listen Umaina, you cannot stay here. You must leave quietly. But where will I go, ma'am? I don't know where. But you can't stay here. Leave immediately. I've paid a year's fee.
So no one can throw me out. Your father paid the fee. And he's having you thrown out. Umaina, for your own sake, leave quietly. Don't force me to call the guards. I said go!
