[131.08] Forgive me.
[164.96] Get up!
[166.68] What's wrong?
[168.52] Where is my chain?
[170.64] What chain, madwoman?
[172.40] Go and sleep.
[173.68] Where is my gold chain?
[177.20] I don't know.
[178.84] Are you accusing me of stealing,
madwoman?
[181.84] Go ask your sister-in-law.
[183.20] Would I rather ask your
lover to whom you gave the chain?
[186.84] Shame on me for doubting Umaina.
[190.36] The real thief is lying next to me.
[193.64] You've lost your mind.
[195.84] These strange prayers
have polluted your mind.
[198.76] Yes, I've lost my mind.
[201.16] I've lost my mind begging,
pleading, praying for a child!
[207.80] You enjoy covering your body
with feculence and grubbiness.
[211.52] Your mind is filled with dirt.  That's
the reason my prayers don't get answered.
[215.68] Enough.
[217.12] I won't tolerate it anymore.
[219.32] You're the unfortunate one
who carries this sad face around.
[222.76] I alone tolerate you.
[225.16] You tolerate me?
[227.20] I am unfortunate.
[228.96] I see...
[230.72] What did you see in that maid?
[233.88] She must be smelling atrocious.
[239.12] She didn't disgust you?
[241.00] You didn't feel disgusted?
[242.28] No, I don't.
[243.76] I like her.
She's much better compared to you.
[248.20] The fragrance of a complete woman!
[252.84] I'm having an affair with her.
I gave the chain to her.
[257.00] Let's see what you can do.
[290.16] Humaira...
[292.48] Humaira?
[296.84] What's the matter?
[302.64] Nothing, Bay ji.
[305.60] Go back to rest.
[306.52] Right.
[308.96] With you standing over
my head in the night?
[313.84] Do you need more money?
[319.80] No.
[326.12] Take it from my cupboard.
[329.44] Leave some for me.
[332.64] Even you think I'm a beggar, Bay ji.
I don't want your money.
[339.52] What's the matter?  What happened?
[354.36] Bay ji.
[358.00] Don't you pray for me?
[360.08] Perfect.
[363.08] This is something new.  Time to get up.
[369.92] You have come up with
something new this time.
[372.84] If the mother doesn't pray
for her child then who will.
[376.08] What's the matter?
[378.68] Maybe you don't mean it.
[382.48] He never listens to me.
[385.72] He only listens to mothers.
[389.24] Maybe he'll listen to you.
[393.60] God didn't bless me
with the opportunity
[395.36] to become a mother.
[398.08] How can I believe that
prayers are answered?
[400.48] Listen, Humaira,
[404.04] prayers are always answered.
[408.88] If the devotee's faith isn't strong,
[411.12] then you don't blame God.
[415.28] Is my faith weak?
[418.08] Mine, Bay ji?
[421.08] I see...
[423.04] And Umaina has a
gold medal in integrity.
[425.96] Okay, fine.  Stop it now.
[428.64] For God's sake, I am begging you.
[434.40] Don't be hasty.
[436.32] Your hastiness ruins
all the good that you do.
[441.72] He blesses everyone.
[443.12] Everyone.
[446.00] But we humans are thankless.
[447.88] We complain when our
prayers are answered.
[449.28] and also when they are not.
[452.36] The one you're jealous of,
[456.36] has nothing.
[458.96] Nothing at all.
[460.92] Nature is unfair, Bay ji.
[464.64] It doesn't bless the
one who's pining for it.
[473.00] But blessed is the one who
didn't want it in the first place.
[479.00] Seek forgiveness, Humaira.
[482.84] You should never
question God's will.
[485.92] Why not, Bay ji?
Why shouldn't I complain?
[490.24] Is it my fault that
I can't bear a child?
[493.60] Why should I be punished
for nature's mistake, Bay ji?
[510.16] Bay ji.
[511.40] Yes.
[513.72] Tell Shammo...
[518.08] ...to give the child to me.
[521.24] I will raise him.
[525.72] Let's sit on the swing.
[530.24] Let's sit on the swing.
[534.32] Come on.
Bless you, son.
[541.00] Good boy.
[544.64] Bless you.
[553.12] Let's swing.  Good boy.
[562.36] Go make tea.
[582.68] Swing.
[585.60] Swing.
[586.88] Ali likes to swing.
[589.08] Ali likes to swing.
[591.24] - Bless you.  Bless you.
- Shammo.
[594.32] Bless you.
[596.24] Yes, Bay ji.
[598.12] Yes, my dear.
[602.32] You're playing with
the child all day,
[608.08] what about your business?
[611.88] Come on, Bay ji,
we've got workers at the shop.
[615.04] Isn't it?  Isn't it?
[617.80] Isn't it?
[618.92] Leaving your business
in the hands of workers.
[622.24] Didn't Abdullah catch
the workers skimming?
[626.12] And you're letting them
handle the entire business.
[628.32] Bay ji, one needs to trust people.
[633.08] The boys are very nice.
They are very good.
[638.12] I know they are nice,
they can handle everything.
[642.96] And why are you doing a woman's job?
[646.72] Let her take care of him.
[649.96] And if your wife can't raise her,
[654.08] then give him to Humaira.
[656.12] She will take care of him.
[658.48] Bay ji, why trouble anyone?
[661.52] Isn't it, Ali?
[664.24] - It's not about the-
- I've made a point.
[669.44] We don't bother anyone.
[671.80] We don't bother anyone.
[675.04] Stop it.  Let's play.  Let's play.
[681.68] Ali, my boy.
[683.60] Let's play.
[689.08] Well, you don't even
know your sister brought tea.
[692.00] Ali...
[699.32] Come on.
[735.72] Bay ji, where is Ali?
[737.28] I don't know.
[739.20] And since when did
you worry about Ali?
[742.48] He was crying in the room,
[743.96] did anyone take him?
[745.08] Who will take him?
He can't run away on his own.
[750.88] And listen, have you done something?
[883.04] For God's sake Bay ji,
what are you saying?
[885.84] No, Shammo,
I saw it with my own eyes.
[889.36] I could never muster the
courage before, to witness this.
[891.32] What other evidence do
you want of her love?
[893.32] You've got evidence, don't you?
[895.20] - I've had enough.
- Shammo, listen...
[898.64] - Humaira, give him back.
- No, please.
[900.88] Give Ali back.
[901.76] Give Ali back to me.
Don't be crazy.
[904.84] - I won't give him back.
- Listen.  Why don't you understand?
[910.48] Bay ji.
[911.28] Bay ji, how can you give
someone's child to another person.
[913.60] Then go ask her if
she wants the child.
[917.16] She doesn't.
[918.68] And look at her.
[920.08] This child makes your sister happy,
[921.96] so why don't you give
her this child.
[924.40] Why don't you be
the bigger person here?
[926.08] - She can be a mother too.
- But Bay ji.
[928.44] Bay ji is right.
[931.44] Bay ji is right.
[933.44] How can I...
[938.68] - Umi!
- Stop.  Stop it.
[941.24] - Please.
- Umi!
[945.16] It's okay, it's okay.
[989.80] Don't cry.
[995.12] Those who don't have a house,
[997.12] live in rented homes.
[999.20] And those who can't bear children,
[1001.24] become nannies to other children.
[1007.84] Stupid woman.
[1009.96] You should become a midwife.
[1013.44] Help with childbirth for money.
[1016.68] Maybe then you'll be at peace.
[1019.44] Useless woman!  Barren woman!
[1034.24] Humaira...
[1040.80] Where are you taking
the child at this hour?
[1042.84] I'm taking Ali to the shrine,
[1046.72] to get him purged.
[1048.20] Then take Shammo along.
[1049.36] No, no, he'll be a nuisance.
[1052.64] I'll take him myself.
[1054.80] Goodbye.
[1084.84] Come out.
[1088.16] Will you leave quietly
or take a beating?
[1092.52] Come out.
[1098.76] Come out.
[1105.44] Come out.
[1110.20] Didn't you hear me?
[1114.16] Come out.
[1180.08] Shush.
[1186.40] You're here.
[1190.08] Did you bring the child?
[1193.80] Yes.
[1199.64] The ritual will
start on Friday night.
[1205.92] Are you ready?
[1231.44] Man is unique in his own way.
[1236.00] He has so many faces and masks,
[1239.76] that he fails to recognize
his own identity.
[1277.88] I am asking you again.
[1281.20] Are you ready for this ritual?
[1310.76] Humaira wasn't bad
just like the rest of us.
[1315.44] We aren't good or bad.
[1319.24] Desires,
wishes, unfulfilled happiness,
[1325.20] make us do good or bad deeds.
[1329.12] But during the process,
[1332.36] we don't realize that...
[1336.16] ...we're actually falling into a pit.
[1343.24] There was me,
[1346.24] who wasn't ready to accept my child.
[1351.84] And then there was Humaira,
[1356.08] who wanted to become a
mother at any cost!
[1361.88] Even if she had to
pay any price for it.
[1367.32] Disappointment had
completely engulfed her.
[1372.68] She was doing it to get the tag
of a barren woman off herself.
[1404.60] Humaira.
[1407.32] Humaira.
[1426.44] What is it?
[1435.12] What is it?
[1437.72] What's the matter?
[1439.20] Are you hungry?
[1441.72] Hold still.
[1446.80] Your hand is stuck.
[1452.08] Wait a second.  Settle down.
[1459.08] Humaira, what happened
to his wrist?
[1466.72] I don't know, Bay ji.
[1469.48] - Maybe it got twisted.
- Twisted?
[1472.88] It's completely blue.
[1476.12] Look at the color.
[1477.64] This looks bad.
[1482.36] Are you not taking care of him?
[1484.16] I do, Bay ji,
I take good care of him.
[1499.12] Don't embarrass
me in front of Shammo.
[1505.48] Never, Bay ji.
[1509.76] I'll give him a bath.
[1513.04] The water is warm now.
[1549.40] Ali.
[1558.36] What happened, Umi?
[1563.84] What happened?
[1566.24] Humaira...
[1569.84] Humaira what?
[1571.00] Nothing.
[1579.60] Here.
[1596.36] I am fine.
[1614.88] Everything else is fine, Rukhi, but,
[1618.08] But what?
[1621.04] My heart is restless.
[1625.40] When a person does a good deed, Shameem
[1630.28] must accept it.
[1633.20] Imagine how happy
Humaira is with Ali.
[1641.48] I don't know why,
[1644.68] she never brings him in front of me.
[1647.52] She always tries to
keep him away from my sight.
[1651.40] She's afraid you
might take him back.
[1657.24] You should be happy that
Ali's still in the same house.
[1663.16] Amidst family.
[1668.00] You're right.
[1670.60] But Umi is very restless.
[1673.24] She doesn't tell me.
[1676.64] This distance from
Ali has been bothering her.
[1683.28] She kept him away when he was around,
[1686.00] and now she wakes up in
the middle of the night restless.
[1690.24] After all, she is a mother.
[1701.32] Mother.
[1702.40] Tea.
[1704.08] - Greetings, Bay ji.
- Greetings.
[1709.40] My princess looks so cute.
[1712.16] Look at her, Shammo,
she's looking so beautiful.
[1716.36] You must be tired.
[1717.80] Yes, Bay ji, you know how
these international flights are.
[1719.96] - I am dead beat.
- Salma.
[1723.12] How are you?
[1724.48] Leave her.
[1725.48] Did you get my make-up kit?
[1726.60] Silly girl,
let her settle down first.
[1731.24] "Did you get my make-up kit?"
[1732.96] Leave her, come and rest.
[1734.84] Did you get everything I told you to?
[1736.20] - Yes, I got everything.
- Come on.
[1742.08] Come on.
[1750.92] What are you doing with my brother?
[1753.40] What are you tormenting him for?
[1756.32] The guy who betrayed you
is leading a comfortable life.
[1760.48] Bilal had a son.
[1763.16] He's posting pictures on Facebook.
[1766.52] Your situation didn't matter to him.
[1768.80] My brother's life was ruined.
[1771.84] I am talking to you.
[1773.64] Say something.
[1782.00] The tea is getting cold.  Finish it.
[1791.40] Ms.  Nanny...
[1795.96] Ms.  International Nanny.
[1805.04] What's the matter?
[1806.00] Why are you always lost in thought?
[1808.32] Nothing.
[1809.64] What nothing?
[1810.48] I used to always find you
praying or pleading, but now...
[1813.24] I wonder what goes on in that
mind of yours now?
[1815.80] Tell me.
[1818.68] I said nothing.
[1821.60] You're saying nothing,
[1823.80] but a lot is going
on in that mind of yours.
[1826.44] Someone has occupied your mind.
[1831.40] Well,
[1834.32] do you have some money?
[1836.32] I need it.
[1841.36] I don't have it.
[1846.16] Not to spend on that maid.
[1849.12] Why?  Don't they pay
you to be his nanny?
[1853.08] Are you working for free?
[1856.64] Good for nothing.
[1858.28] My bad luck.
[1879.28] What?  Can I come inside?
[1882.60] What are you saying?
[1887.36] Her husband's here.
[1918.20] Shammo.
[1919.68] Shammo.
[1921.96] What's the matter?
Why are you making a racket?
[1924.00] Racket?
[1924.92] There's a storm raging
inside me today.
[1927.52] I can't believe my eyes.
[1931.64] I have a bad reputation.
[1933.68] But this house is
full of sinners.
[1937.52] What are you trying to say?
Come to the point.
[1939.92] Tell me how much you love your son?
[1943.80] And how much can you
pay me to save his life?
[1945.48] Are you talking about Ali?
[1948.36] Hurry up, we're running out of time.
[1950.48] Something will happen.
[1959.88] Humaira!
[1991.12] Why don't you die!  You've embarrassed me.
[1995.48] Damn you!  Why don't you die!
You'll go to hell for it.
[2001.08] Bay ji.
[2008.24] Children whose parents
don't accept him,
[2012.36] face similar consequences.
[2016.72] If anyone lays a finger on him,
I will gouge his eyes out.
[2025.12] I can raise him alone.
[2027.00] I don't need anyone.
[2029.84] I can raise him and I will prove it.
[2035.08] Alone.
[2038.48] Damn you!  Damn you!  Why don't you die!
[2042.88] Why don't you die?
[2044.92] Why don't you die?
[2081.60] How does it feel to be
on the receiving end, huh?
[2085.28] When everyone's looking down at you,
cursing you, slapping you?
[2092.72] Don't give me money.
[2097.72] I am a scoundrel after all, right?
[2199.20] Hey.
[2203.72] What are you doing?
[2209.24] What are you, Shameem?
[2217.08] And I am so crazy.
[2222.40] The things I've done to you,
[2227.40] to myself,
[2230.12] the child.
[2233.64] Whose sins am I punishing him for?
[2239.96] And yet...
[2244.20] You still...
[2250.48] Forgive me.
