[95.24] Bilal was taking complete
advantage of the situation.
[99.56] He was using Ali
as some kind of trophy.
[104.24] The child he had refused to accept,
[109.12] had now become a
medal of his manhood.
[118.40] Children can be pretty cruel
when they go by their own will.
[123.28] Ali was repeatedly
breaking Shameem's heart.
[128.64] The person who had accepted
Ali was being constantly rejected.
[136.40] The child whose own mother
refused to accept him.
[147.08] Umaina.
[149.68] Yes, Bay ji.
[150.76] Did you mix the spices
properly with the mangoes?
[153.92] Yes, Bay ji.
[155.00] I hope your son doesn't touch them
with his dirty hands and ruin them.
[160.52] Don't worry,
Bay ji, I'll take special care.
[162.40] Okay.
[165.08] Don't worry.
[167.12] These are the worries
that are ruining my old age.
[172.16] Mom, how do I do
this math homework?
[174.92] I don't understand.
[176.32] Miss will scold me.
[177.84] I am busy,
son, go get your father's help.
[180.48] No, he doesn't know anything.
[184.48] Don't be stubborn, Ali.
Take your father's help.
[187.32] Come Ali, I'll teach you.
[188.96] You don't know anything.
[190.56] I'll teach you.
[192.08] No, I hate you.
[193.52] - Don't be stubborn, come on.
- No.
[195.96] Come on.
[197.00] I hate you.  Go away.
[198.28] You little miscreant,
I'll clobber you with my shoe.
[202.00] - Calm down, Bay ji.
- Go away.  I hate you.
[203.56] - Go away.
- Mind your own business.
[205.28] I hate you.
[206.28] I don't like you.
[207.28] Telling your own mother
to mind her business.
[210.36] Tell your little
miscreant some manners.
[216.52] Don't worry,
Bay ji, I'll teach Ali a lesson.
[218.96] Telling me not to worry.
[222.00] It's all your fault.
You spoiled him.
[224.92] You made him what he is.
[227.04] It would never come to this
if he had a child of his own.
[230.76] I wouldn't be crying.
[233.04] I'll teach him.
[234.76] I'll teach him a lesson.
[238.84] There's nothing you can do.
[305.28] The physician we'll
be visiting this time,
[308.52] is known for his
extraordinary medicines.
[311.16] Nothing is going to affect you now.
[315.00] You've grown old.
[317.44] You can't have children now.
[319.56] You should discourage such thoughts.
[327.76] That's not true.
[331.04] I am not that old.
[334.28] And anyway, when God wills,
[337.96] even older women have been
blessed with kids.
[341.76] You must come with me this time.
[346.88] Why should I come along?
[351.64] The doctor said that both husband
and wife should take the medicine.
[358.64] So if there's a problem with anyone...
[362.28] The problem is in you, understand.
[366.24] I could've had half a dozen
children with anyone else.
[371.36] I don't have time to waste
with your bloody physicians.
[377.04] All you do is waste your
time on the mobile phone.
[381.00] Who has time to spare more than you?
[383.08] I'll break that head of
yours with this mobile phone,
[385.24] where these vile thoughts come from.
[388.44] Problem?
[389.80] If there's a problem with me,
then go sleep with someone else.
[397.48] How can you say such a
disgusting thing to your wife?
[400.48] I can.
[401.32] Go.
[402.24] Get out of my sight.
[404.40] You worthless barren woman.
[410.48] I won't be barren for too long.
[414.08] I won't die with this accusation.
[418.88] Never.
[421.44] We'll see about that.
[423.56] I am right here.
[507.96] Put on this cloth,
we're visiting your grandma.
[510.52] I don't want to meet anyone, mother.
[513.56] Rukhsana.
[515.16] Rukhsana.
[517.04] Yes.
[519.12] Yes...
[519.96] I am going to the shop,
[522.04] and later I'll go for the...
[524.88] You're leaving.
[526.56] Fatima's coming home after so long.
[528.96] Spend some time with her.
[533.36] I've said several times,
[535.32] don't interrupt me
when I'm doing God's will.
[539.40] This love and care
are just worldly things.
[543.00] Women and children are
just an illusion, a trial.
[547.96] When will you understand?
[551.64] And you?
[553.44] Where are you going?
[557.68] Fatima has come home
after a long time,
[559.20] so I thought I'll
pay Bay ji a visit.
[562.28] But Fatima's throwing tantrums.
[565.48] Please talk to her.
[567.00] She is right.
[568.56] That's not a home.  It's a brothel.
[572.12] And you want to take your
young daughter over there.
[575.16] - You've lost your mind.
- Come,
[576.36] I'll go with you.
It's getting late.
[584.08] Disgusting.
[589.68] - Is everything going well?
- Yes, sir.
[591.48] Very nice, very nice.
[593.28] Wonderful.
[595.20] No complaints, alright.
[597.56] All good?
[599.36] Excellent.  Excellent.
[614.36] Hi.
[617.52] I am Tony.
[621.36] Hairstylist.
[625.68] I read about the
job opening on Facebook.
[630.28] I'm so sorry, I know I'm late,
[633.60] but is the job still available?
[635.64] Sorry, but we've already
employed someone.
[639.16] Please, don't say that.
[642.88] Look, I'm in a lot of trouble.
[644.44] I am unemployed.
[646.00] You can test me.
[649.36] I told you we are
not hiring anymore, thank you.
[654.16] Look, I am good at my job and,
[658.84] Come on.
[660.12] I mean you should
understand my problem.
[667.56] What do you mean?
[669.36] What else?
[672.28] You know what I mean.
[676.08] Please, one little favor.
[679.00] Fine, we'll see.
[681.60] Thank you.
[685.20] Can I look around?
[689.84] Thank you.
[713.12] After Tony's arrival,
[719.28] there were drastic
changes in my complexes.
[724.56] Do I look like him?
[729.56] This thought was irritating me.
[734.96] Ali's departure...
[741.20] had me scared.
[744.28] Do it well.
[750.36] Greetings, it's been a while.
[753.80] Is he doing well?
[754.64] - Yes, of course.
- Good.
[756.16] Do let us know if
you have any complaints?
[757.44] - Okay, sure.
- Are you satisfied?
[759.20] Yes, sure.
[761.16] Okay, thank you.
[811.36] There's PTM in Ali's school.
[813.12] We've got to go tomorrow morning.
[816.80] You can go.  I'm busy, I can't go.
[824.00] - I want you to go-
- I said I cannot go!
[827.36] I am busy!
[847.32] Sorry.
[851.64] Why are you saying sorry?
[854.96] If you had scolded him the same way,
[857.96] then he wouldn't be
so selfish and mannerless.
[863.44] If you don't want to
attend the PTM because of Ali,
[865.92] then you're being unfair to him.
[871.24] You know he doesn't like it.
[874.04] His friends make fun of him.
[875.28] I don't want that.
[878.84] I've spent my life
hearing these things.
[880.56] I've endured a lot.
[882.60] I don't want Ali
to face these things.
[885.08] Ali is still a child,
but you're mature.
[891.20] If he doesn't respect you,
[893.52] then he'll never
respect himself either.
[896.96] What he's shaping into isn't right.
[900.44] No one loves such children.
They would all hate him.
[904.20] Do you want everyone to hate him?
[908.64] No.
[911.76] So you'll come to the PTM with me.
[916.12] Will you?
[925.36] What's the matter?
[926.16] Is there some kind
of problem in your house?
[930.24] He's always confused,
[931.96] although he's an intelligent child.
[938.96] - Oh, he's so strong.
- I know.
[940.48] Yes, one more.
[942.08] Let's go.
[948.44] Ali, handsome boy.
[950.00] Show me your muscles.
[951.28] Oh my, God.  So strong.
[953.36] Stronger than me.
[955.28] Hi-five.
[961.16] Hi-five.
[967.48] Come on, let's go.
[1009.92] Shameem.
[1012.76] I know you're in pain.
[1016.68] I can understand what
you're feeling right now.
[1022.12] I've been wanting to tell you,
[1025.68] but I didn't know what to say.
[1028.92] Or how to tell you?
[1031.24] That's why I insisted
on attending the PTM,
[1035.92] so you could see for yourself.
[1041.92] Umi...
[1045.16] Umi, he'll take Ali from me.
[1048.44] Did you notice how
much Ali respects him-
[1051.96] Shameem.
[1053.84] You know the kind of person he is,
[1056.20] and the respect he deserves.
[1058.88] He should be embarrassed, not you.
[1061.20] Don't be like this.
[1063.92] Shameem, he's trying to impress Ali.
[1066.68] He's using him as a trophy.
[1068.04] Don't let him.
[1069.56] Don't.
[1072.84] You were right.
[1076.16] We should change his school.
[1079.00] - Yes.
- No!
[1080.28] Yes.
[1081.36] That's what I thought earlier.
[1083.32] But honestly speaking,
[1084.48] changing his school
or friends won't matter.
[1088.16] It won't change Ali's perspective.
[1090.76] Ali will have to change himself.
[1092.28] He must face reality.
[1094.84] He has to accept you.
[1097.40] What does he know about you?
[1101.16] I know how precious you are.
[1104.28] Don't be like this.
[1106.24] I know you'll pull Ali out of this,
[1108.40] just like you did with me.
[1111.32] Shameem...
[1112.20] I am tired.
[1113.76] I am tired.
[1116.28] I am tired.
[1118.08] I wonder what life wants from me.
[1121.48] I am tired.
[1123.08] Shameem.
[1126.84] The life I know will
only get more complicated.
[1132.20] We have to be firm.
[1136.28] - You can do it.
- No, I can't do it.
[1137.36] You've done it so far.
You've handled everyone.
[1140.12] You've handled someone like me,
[1141.28] he's still your son.
[1142.76] Shameem...
[1144.16] I know you're brave.
[1147.28] - No... -
You'll be fine.  Hush, calm down.
[1151.00] He'll take him away from me.
[1180.36] Do you want anything to eat, Fatima?
[1185.56] What happened to your face?
[1188.36] Did he slap you again?
[1190.24] No, Bay ji...
[1192.24] Such a weird guy.
[1201.84] What's the matter?
[1204.16] Listen...
[1205.24] She hasn't said a
word since she arrived.
[1210.04] Earlier her voice could be
heard all over the house.
[1214.44] She's grown up now, Bay ji.
[1216.88] She has become
a religious scholar, I guess.
[1219.80] Maybe that's why she
became more patient in nature.
[1222.12] Patience, my foot.
[1225.68] She is always in Umaina's room.
[1230.16] Won't even step out.
[1234.48] She always wants to do
whatever her father refuses her.
[1240.20] I told her not to be so rebellious,
[1245.16] but she doesn't listen.
[1247.52] What?
[1251.48] Nothing,
let me massage your other leg.
[1254.76] First, massage this one properly.
[1256.84] Where's your mind at?
[1297.84] If you have something to say then, say it to
my face,
[1299.36] stop following me like a mutt.
[1301.36] Sorry, I thought...
[1303.44] You thought I could
ridicule this decent girl.
[1308.16] Listen...do you have a cigarette?
[1311.96] Yes.
[1313.24] Won't you offer your
sister a cigarette, as***le?
[1316.48] Good lord, the way you talk!
[1319.00] Are you going to
offer me in the open?
[1321.04] Let's go to a park.
[1323.32] We can smoke there.
[1344.08] Fatima had decided to rebel against
brother Abdullah's strict nature.
[1350.96] Even if she had to
face dire consequences.
[1360.88] And on the other hand was Ali,
[1364.04] who couldn't be controlled even
after all the love we showered on him.
[1445.64] Aren't you Umaina?
[1449.24] Bilal's old girlfriend.
[1451.28] I saw your pictures.
[1455.04] You're beautiful,
[1457.56] and also lucky you
didn't marry Bilal.
[1492.28] Someone seems to
be in a good mood today.
[1497.80] Where do you go every
day looking so chic?
[1502.20] Just doing as you ordered.
[1533.64] Why are you stressing yourself?
[1538.68] For Ali.
[1542.00] He's just a kid.
[1544.00] Don't worry, he'll understand.
[1553.24] We'll be torn miles apart by then.
[1562.28] I can see nothing but
hatred for me in Ali's eyes.
[1570.24] He doesn't hate you.
[1573.64] He's just confused.
[1577.00] When he finds out the
things you've done for him, the
[1581.88] problems you've endured,
[1584.28] then even he will worship
you like me.
[1586.84] Umi, I'm a human being.
[1591.96] I want love, not devotion.
[1613.36] What is it?
[1614.32] What is it?
[1615.28] I'm only giving you company.
[1617.84] I don't want your company.
[1619.40] - Come on.
- I said no.
[1622.00] Just a little.
[1623.16] Mind your own business.
[1625.04] Go on.
[1637.28] Go.  Get lost.
[1672.24] Come on, Champ.
[1674.12] Come on, fast.
[1675.20] Ali, run.
[1676.24] Faster!
[1677.08] - That's my boy.
- Yes.
[1678.64] Why are you guys so lazy today?
[1680.60] Come on.
[1681.44] - Yes.
- Come on, faster.
[1682.96] Ali, run faster!
[1685.44] Raaim had protein shake
with his father.
[1688.08] Ali, run faster!
[1691.12] Didn't your mom
feed you properly today?
[1694.56] Yes, yes, yes.
[1697.16] - What's wrong with you, Ali?
- Run.
[1698.84] - I can't run.
- Run.
[1700.52] Run, yes, yes, run, run...
[1702.56] - Faster, faster.
- Come on, run.
[1704.16] - Come on, boys, come on.
- Yes, yes.
[1706.00] Yes, run faster.
[1709.24] I want to see full energy.  Yes.
[1717.24] Yes, yes.
[1720.28] Come on, Raaim.
[1722.16] Come on, boys, come on.
[1723.60] Run faster.
[1724.32] Quickly.  Quickly.
[1725.68] - Faster, Raaim.
- Yes, yes.
[1728.52] Faster.  Faster.
[1732.28] Yes.
[1732.88] I think Ali's having
some serious health problem.
[1737.36] No, that's not the case.
[1739.24] What happened?
[1741.84] Maybe it's psychological.
[1743.96] Whenever a child is facing
a mental conflict,
[1748.16] I've noticed that it affects
their health as well.
[1752.48] Do you get what I'm saying?
[1755.28] I think he needs
serious counseling.
[1769.36] Come on, Ali, let's practice.
[1771.24] No, I don't want
to practice with you!
[1773.40] Ali, how can we win
if we don't practice?
[1776.88] Come on, son.
[1778.16] Bravo.  Get up.
[1780.84] Get up, Ali.
[1785.96] Won't you listen to your father?
[1787.84] Ali, you should
listen to your father.
[1791.00] After all,
he is really good at sports.
[1795.20] Okay, kids.
[1797.36] Although Mr.
Shameem is a proper athlete.
[1804.96] He's a champion.
[1807.04] He's just a little...
[1811.00] When he runs,
[1813.80] oh God.
[1817.32] Umi, I've sprained my leg.
[1825.88] I mean other than that
he's fitter than me, definitely.
[1831.64] But sometimes when he exercises,
[1835.20] it's like this.
[1842.68] It's so hot, with this jacket and all.
[1847.84] If Mr.  Shameem does pushups,
[1851.88] how would he look?
[1853.16] It will look like this.
[1861.48] Oh, God.  I am tired!
[1872.04] Shammo.
[1876.00] Shammo.
[1879.12] Shammo.
[1882.92] I'm sorry, children,
I was only joking with him.
[1886.52] So Mr.  Shameem...
[1893.44] What happened?
[1895.36] Shammo.
[1906.12] What happened?
[1912.32] No, please.  Don't do it.
[1915.60] It's very painful.
[1917.28] But don't worry, Ali,
[1919.76] I'll win the parent's
race on Sports' day.
[1923.04] Stop being so obsessed
with sports day.
[1925.96] Have you seen how
swollen your leg is?
[1928.24] How can you run?
[1930.08] - In fact, let's drop this idea.
- No, no,
[1932.44] you were never going to win anyway.
[1934.16] You're such a disappointment, dad.
[1936.08] Shut up, Ali.
[1937.56] He's right.  I am a disappointment.
[1942.20] School's on fire.  It's spreading quickly.
[1946.20] Fire.  Fire.
[1948.56] School's on fire.  Hurry up.
[1951.04] Where are you going?
[2065.44] Stop it.  Stop it.
[2068.88] Don't clap.
[2071.12] Don't make a scene here.
[2073.12] Stop this drama.
[2075.56] You should all be ashamed.
[2077.20] A while ago everyone
was laughing at him!
[2083.04] All the men were making fun of him.
[2089.48] Mr.  Bilal, muscles don't make a man.
[2094.24] A man stands firm
during tough times.
[2100.88] A man puts others before himself.
[2103.92] He's not a sick chauvinist like you,
who only loves himself.
[2110.76] Stop it, Umi.
[2112.16] Let me speak.
[2115.12] I've no shame in admitting, Shameem
[2117.00] stood by
me when no one else did!
[2121.48] When I was facing
postpartum depression,
[2125.40] Shameem saved Ali.
[2127.08] Umi...
[2128.92] Your father took care of you
when your own mother rejected you!
[2134.40] I wanted to strangle you!
[2136.76] Umi, stop it.
[2139.96] Let me speak.
[2141.56] You were there, Shameem.
[2146.40] If it weren't for Shameem,
[2148.00] Ali would be long dead.
[2149.80] He should be thankful to his father,
[2152.52] instead, he thinks his
father is a disappointment.
[2157.48] Is this what
competition teaches you?
[2159.92] Or every race.
[2163.64] Umi.
[2165.36] Be aggressive.  Win!
[2167.28] Trample over others to win.
[2169.08] Use force to show your manliness.
[2173.92] Publicly insult your wife.
[2176.28] Is this manliness?
[2180.28] Shame on you!
[2183.24] Stop it.  Stop it.
[2184.96] You men are not even comparable
to Shameem's shoes.
[2190.24] And I feel sorry for women
[2192.04] who have husbands like Bilal.
[2194.96] And I feel proud of myself,
[2197.24] to have a companion like Shameem.
[2200.88] Get up Shameem..
[2203.40] I don't know what came over
me that day!
[2209.24] But I had overcome every hesitation,
[2212.32] and I spoke my heart out.
[2217.16] I don't know how many perspectives
I changed that day, towards Shameem
[2221.16] and more like him.
[2229.88] But yes,
[2231.60] there were some people,
[2233.84] my son being on top of the list,
[2237.88] I certainly wanted to
see his perspective change.
