[191.24] Ali, wake up son.
[193.32] You'll be late for school.
[197.12] Ali.
[199.36] What did you do?
[201.84] Mama, papa is looking like a princess.
[204.56] Stupid, is this how you behave with papa?
[206.56] Get up.
[209.08] - What happened?
- Nothing, he's being naughty.
[212.64] Let's go.
[257.20] Here's your shirt.
[259.64] Put it on my head.
[261.20] Keep it over there.
[265.76] There's no need to
get irritated at this hour.
[268.88] It's your shirt.
[271.08] I am obliged. Let me kiss your hands.
[278.56] Why can't you ever be polite?
[281.92] Other husbands are so caring.
[285.04] But you...
[286.80] They have a reason.
[290.40] I'll treat you nicely
when I've a reason to.
[294.84] Bam!
[299.76] Bloody dog-
[301.56] Let it be, he's just a kid.
[303.08] What are you doing?
[304.44] It's just water. It will dry up soon.
[305.96] Just water.
[307.12] Would you be pleased
if it was acid instead?
[309.84] Bas***
[311.28] For God's sake,
please don't use that word!
[314.52] What else does one call a bas***?
[318.12] Iron it again.
[320.20] And I don't want to
see a single stain of water.
[323.04] If I see him again, I will rip him apart!
[331.08] Go on and hurry up.
[338.84] What am I hearing?
[340.32] Why did you do it?
[341.96] Say sorry to uncle.
[345.48] Ali, say sorry.
[347.08] Why should I?
[347.92] Why not? It was your fault!
[349.76] Say sorry.
[351.00] - Because I don't like him.
- Ali!
[353.24] End of conversation.
[355.00] If he doesn't like me,
then this was planned.
[360.04] Bay ji, he might shoot me tomorrow,
[362.96] because he doesn't like me.
[364.60] Don't make a mountain out of a mole.
[366.48] He doesn't know what he's saying.
[368.92] He's not a child.
[370.44] He's a...
[374.60] Bay ji, he's a child, but you're not.
[377.96] You haven't said a word.
[379.32] I would if you let me.
[383.88] Come on, son, he's older than you.
[386.32] Now apologise.
[387.84] Come on.
[389.52] Say sorry Ali, or else I will slap you.
[391.80] - Say sorry.
- Umi, what are you doing?
[394.00] Have you lost your mind?
[396.04] Everyone's judging him
like he's committed murder.
[399.24] You don't know what he's done, Shammo.
[401.88] I know, Bay ji, I heard everything.
[404.08] So what if he dropped water on his shirt?
[406.96] He's just a child.
[408.08] But the rest of you are acting like kids.
[414.84] No one knew how to
spoil better than Shameem.
[419.32] He did the same with Ali.
[422.88] He wouldn't see beyond his father.
[427.24] Everyone else meant nothing to him.
Not even me.
[433.88] He was the apple of his father's eye.
[438.20] He was Shameem's entire world,
[442.88] No stone was left unturned
to spoil the work.
[447.00] Because she had changed completely.
[453.12] Right?
[461.44] What are you doing?
[462.68] Leave it. I'll do it.
[464.64] What are you doing?
[465.76] Go get ready. Don't you want
to attend the Salon's opening?
[468.48] Exactly, women need more time.
[471.00] I'll need only a couple of minutes.
Leave it.
[473.04] I am not going, Shameem.
[474.96] What do you mean?
[476.28] I'm starting a new business,
[478.36] and I won't do it without you.
[480.32] You know I don't go anywhere,
so stop insisting.
[485.68] This is exactly why I want
you to step out of this confinement.
[488.84] I want that old Umi back.
[493.00] Leave it.
[493.92] Go and get ready quickly.
[495.36] Go on.
[507.24] You did the right thing
by putting tape on it.
[510.96] It's nice.
[511.64] Very nice.
[512.40] It's beautiful.
[518.76] Isn't it?
[519.76] It's much more beautiful on the inside.
[522.04] Very beautiful.
[523.24] Your older sister and
Fatima didn't show up.
[529.28] You know about brother Abdullah,
[531.04] he doesn't approve of such things.
[532.24] Everything we do is a sin for him.
[536.04] Forget it, Bay ji.
[537.36] It's time to celebrate,
don't spoil your mood.
[539.12] I am telling you no one likes
to see Shammo happy.
[542.92] - They are all jealous of him.
- Fine, stop it now.
[545.04] Congratulations,
Shameem sir, you've been going places.
[549.28] First the clubhouse now this salon.
[551.28] Can I get a discount?
[552.48] Of course.
[554.12] With hard work, one can go places.
[556.80] Who is cutting the ribbon?
[558.36] My lucky charm, my Ali.
[561.56] Ali will inaugurate the place.
[564.68] What are you doing, Shameem,
[565.68] Give it to Bay ji,
she will do the honours.
[567.16] No, I will cut the ribbon.
[568.92] Papa, I will cut the ribbon.
[571.56] Don't insist, son.
[573.60] Come on, okay. Happy?
[575.96] Come, let's inaugurate the place.
[579.00] - Stand here.
- Come on, Bay ji.
[581.88] Come with me.
[583.24] Good boy.
[585.64] Take a picture.
[587.08] Come.
[588.88] Come, Bay ji.
[590.52] Let's do this.
[594.00] Here...
[603.24] Come, Bay ji. Let's all go inside.
[605.44] Very good.
[610.56] Give me that.
[611.96] Come, we'll give the first haircut to Ali.
[634.80] This is really unbelievable.
[637.12] Letting another child inaugurate
the place when your mother's still around.
[641.12] Wonderful.
[643.12] Shammo aunty is a piece of work.
[645.08] For God's sake,
don't say anything in front of Bay ji,
[648.60] She's already pretty sad.
[654.08] Bay ji...
[657.48] Congratulations, along with the ribbon,
[660.12] he also cut off your honour.
[662.04] Leave her alone, brother Khurram.
[664.36] Shameem...
[666.52] Go, spend some time with Bay ji.
[668.08] They are having a good time.
[671.08] Shameem, she looks upset.
[673.08] No, she is fine.
[676.24] It's absolutely right, isn't it?
[678.36] Did I say anything wrong?
[680.80] Why don't you stick
that scissor in my neck?
[684.24] Rascal.
[685.80] Why are you getting mad at me?
[687.12] He let that child cut the ribbon...
[694.92] If not the ribbon,
can we at least get some juice?
[698.36] This is unfair.
[758.80] - Greetings.
- Hello.
[761.00] You guys didn't show up for the opening,
[762.76] so I thought I'll personally
bring the sweets over.
[766.04] - Here you go.
- Please come.
[771.24] Greetings.
[772.76] Hello.
Here you go.
[775.12] How is it?
[776.44] It's...
[780.12] How was the opening?
[784.00] Very nice.
[787.96] Keep it.
[790.12] - Go on.
- Okay.
[800.04] Brother Abdullah,
you didn't even taste the sweets.
[803.32] It's delicious made in clarified butter.
[806.08] It's banned for us.
[808.96] Why else would people commit sin?
[817.88] I know you don't like salons,
[821.28] but believe me, it's the latest trend.
[824.00] It's a money-minting business.
[826.04] It's a trend of evil and mischief.
[829.68] One has to tread carefully.
[831.76] There's a thin line between
acceptable and unacceptable.
[834.28] You were dealing in clothes.
[836.88] Why do you wander in these businesses?
[839.08] Are you not worried about your image?
[841.16] Tea.
[845.56] When is Fatima coming back?
[849.24] It's been ages since I last saw her.
[851.60] And you never will.
[853.28] She has gone through the ablution ritual.
[855.08] She has become a religious scholar.
[857.16] She will stay behind a veil.
[858.76] What are you saying?
[861.04] Why hide behind a veil from her uncle?
[863.64] Yes...
[864.96] And from an uncle like him.
[867.24] My daughter is a pious child.
[870.16] She's my salvation.
[874.04] By the way,
you should worry about Ali too.
[878.60] You should make Ali go through
the ablution ritual as well.
[881.04] You're building a pathway to hell.
[884.08] Give it a thought.
[890.44] Forget him. Drink your tea.
[894.04] You too.
[902.24] Everything hurts. I am rendered useless.
[906.12] - You called Bay ji.
- Yes, I did.
[910.04] Because you don't
show your face otherwise.
[912.08] You need to be summoned.
[915.56] Why are you upset?
[916.92] Tell me what's wrong-
[917.56] -Stand up, come on. On your feet.
[920.16] Oh, God. Leave it.
[923.96] Go back to the one you truly love.
[926.24] Who are you talking about?
[929.60] Why did you tell her to take up a job?
[934.56] Because she's always in the kitchen.
[940.16] I thought a job would
boost her confidence.
[943.56] Don't you remember the old Umi?
[945.36] Yes, I remember.
[949.60] I don't see how it makes a difference.
[953.08] Listen, don't you want your children.
[956.80] What do you mean?
[958.04] What do I mean? Don't act na√Øve now.
[961.96] Don't you want your own children?
[964.04] You two have been married for ages,
[965.88] but to what avail.
[968.56] We've Ali,
Bay ji, why do we need more children?
[972.56] Yes, of course.
[973.56] We've Ali, he's our prince.
[977.60] I am talking about your child.
Your flesh and blood.
[981.12] Shammo, when will you make me a grandma?
[984.84] Stop it, Bay ji, don't say such things.
[986.88] Why not?
[988.92] Now listen to me carefully,
[991.08] you may find it harsh.
[992.48] You'll hate me for this.
[995.04] But let me be completely honest with you.
[998.00] Your wife isn't yours anymore.
[1002.84] She didn't have anyone to support her.
[1005.20] She was helpless.
[1006.80] That's why she took
your support and came here.
[1010.32] That's why she's always in the kitchen.
[1012.96] She has no attachment with you.
[1015.16] And that thing you're trying to boost...
[1018.04] Confidence.
[1018.88] Exactly.
[1019.64] This is my point.
[1021.64] If you boost her confidence,
[1024.96] she will fly away like a bird.
[1026.60] - Okay, enough. Enough, Bay ji.
- What...?
[1029.00] I could never imagine
you'd say such a thing.
[1031.08] How can you be so selfish?
[1032.32] Yes, I am selfish.
[1036.08] I am selfish.
[1039.60] Do you see selfishness in my eyes?
[1044.16] You have...
[1045.48] Get lost.
[1047.28] Tomorrow when I die,
no one will treat you well.
[1052.96] Listen to me carefully, Shammo.
[1056.80] If she really wanted to bear your child,
[1060.36] she could've done it at any time.
But she didn't.
[1064.08] Because she knows.
[1066.04] She knows once she becomes a mother,
[1070.84] she will have to stay here forever.
[1074.88] She will never do it.
She will never do it.
[1077.64] Come on, Bay ji.
[1081.04] Stop it, Bay ji, leave it.
[1118.96] Mrs. Shameem,
do you still didn't love Mr. Shameem?
[1129.56] What is love?
[1133.24] Can you explain?
[1138.20] If the lust for each other's body is love,
[1142.00] then yes, I didn't love him.
[1147.56] And if love is about respect.
[1151.60] how could I love him
when I never respected him?
[1158.20] And when I started respecting
him to the extent of worship,
[1162.96] how could I love him?
[1168.28] I had placed him on a pedestal.
[1176.56] Can anyone love God,
the way he loves humans?
[1187.20] Shameem had brought me
home like a lotus from a pond.
[1194.16] Who else could do such a thing?
[1198.00] I had no choice but to accept him as God.
[1210.44] Just like I gave life to Ali in my womb,
[1216.12] similarly, Shameem groomed
me with his hands into a new person.
[1221.96] A new life.
[1239.04] Papa, please teach me.
[1242.08] Teach me how to bowl.
[1243.76] Ali, I never played cricket in my life.
[1247.64] I can teach you to play Ludo.
[1249.80] Please papa or else I'll lose the match.
[1252.08] I don't know cricket,
Ali, but I can teach you Ludo.
[1255.92] Wait...
[1257.60] Khurram, come teach him cricket.
[1262.08] I don't know these childish games.
[1265.32] I can teach him one of my adult games.
[1268.84] Papa...
[1272.04] You're my super papa.
[1275.04] You bowl and I'll bat.
[1277.16] At least try, papa.
[1279.12] Oh, God.
[1281.28] But I don't know how, Ali.
[1283.12] Try for my sake.
[1285.04] Okay, fine.
[1295.44] Shammo, try bowling straight,
[1298.76] and it'll flail on its own.
[1301.64] Come on.
[1321.56] How was the match today, Ali?
[1328.64] What happened?
[1332.48] Doesn't matter.
Winning and losing is common in sports.
[1338.04] It's a part of the game.
[1340.32] What is this way, Ali?
[1343.08] Why is the place so dirty?
[1346.36] Here. This is ready.
[1349.24] Finish it quickly.
[1351.44] and tomorrow morning my son
will fly to his school like a superhero,
[1356.04] and win all matches.
[1357.40] I don't want it.
[1359.48] Drink it, Ali.
[1361.16] I said I don't want it.
[1363.08] Ali!
[1366.92] What are you doing?
[1369.08] You made him angry.
[1372.20] You act like kids too.
[1374.24] He's lost his mind.
[1415.08] Bismillah! Bismillah! Bismillah!
[1419.28] Welcome, Abdullah sir.
[1424.16] How are you?
[1426.36] Take a seat.
[1438.56] Fatima's coming.
[1442.64] I apologise for the wait.
[1445.44] Don't apologise.
[1448.56] You are my daughter's teacher.
[1451.28] You have made her life.
[1453.04] You made her a religious scholar.
[1455.28] I want to kiss your hands.
[1458.36] In fact, you're almost God to me,
[1461.96] so how can I not apologise to you?
[1464.48] This isn't right.
[1470.20] Abdullah sir, Fatima is a bright girl.
[1473.88] Of course.
[1474.64] She takes no time
in finishing her lessons.
[1477.24] Good.
[1478.08] I've sensed a rebellion
in her personality,
[1481.32] Oh Lord.
[1482.68] but she is a fast learner.
[1485.08] In fact, you should get
another advanced course for her.
[1489.84] As you wish.
[1491.88] And this rebellious nature
comes from her mother.
[1495.76] I always say these bones
and flesh are yours.
[1498.68] You have a right over them.
[1501.32] Your punishments will lead
my daughter to victory.
[1505.48] God bless you.
[1509.04] God bless you.
[1512.24] You performed a miracle.
[1516.84] There you go, Fatima's here.
[1520.76] What am I hearing?
What has Maulana sir been saying?
[1523.80] It was just a concern.
[1527.76] Don't treat it like a complaint.
[1530.84] She is a very good kid.
[1533.28] Go on, child. Go with your father.
[1537.64] God bless you.
[1590.76] Ali...don't do it.
[1593.04] Ali...Ali...
[1596.64] Listen, give your father a hug.
[1600.08] No!
[1601.04] Not even when father
picks you up from school.
[1603.80] Don't pick me up from school, father.
[1606.48] Never again.
[1608.64] Ali.
[1623.28] I hope it's properly made,
sister-in-law Umaina.
[1625.80] I don't want this to make me look uglier.
[1629.24] You've such beautiful features.
[1631.04] Why do you talk so negatively?
[1632.64] A face everyone ignores.
[1636.00] If you don't love yourself,
no one will love you.
[1639.12] Doesn't matter what I
do I'll always be unfortunate.
[1643.24] Forget about prince charming,
[1646.12] even a cobbler wouldn't choose me.
[1648.04] I am not as beautiful as you,
[1650.28] to get a devoted husband like
brother Shameem.
[1654.48] What's wrong with you?
[1656.24] What's wrong with me?
[1658.08] I thought I looked decent.
Do I look worse now?
[1661.32] I meant your language.
[1663.28] You're uttering nonsense.
[1666.08] Even you used to be a loudmouth like this.
[1668.12] Don't you remember?
[1670.04] Our disapprovals were just a pretense,
[1673.20] in reality, we were jealous of you.
[1675.56] Me, Humaira, Rukhsana...
[1680.12] Everyone.
[1681.36] Wash it after 15 minutes,
[1684.44] and tell me if you notice any difference.
[1685.88] Apply some on my hands as well.
[1695.56] Umaina...
[1697.44] Hmm?
[1699.08] I went to the market
and bought this shirt for Ali
[1705.68] Can you give it to him?
[1707.36] Why don't you give it yourself?
[1709.80] No, how can I...
[1714.12] Shammo doesn't like
me anywhere around him.
[1718.88] Even I've been completely unfair to him.
[1723.04] I never even apologised to you.
[1727.64] Please find the heart to forgive me.
[1730.56] I remember nothing.
[1734.04] You should forget it too.
[1736.24] How can I?
[1739.12] Even God won't forgive me.
[1743.60] It's true what they say...
[1746.80] Disappointment changes
a person completely.
[1751.28] Anyway, I don't want anything else.
[1754.16] I would love it if Ali wears this shirt.
[1759.20] Thank you.
[1770.04] Wow...this shirt looks new.
When did you buy it?
[1775.64] It's a gift from Humaira.
[1780.60] Humaira?
[1784.16] Why did you accept the shirt from her?
[1786.88] Don't you know her nature?
[1790.24] I wonder what spell she's cast on it.
[1793.40] And anyway he's been
angry with me recently,
[1795.20] I wonder why?
[1796.68] He's lost his mind which I'll fix.
[1799.36] And this shirt's looking so nice.
[1802.84] He's looking handsome like his papa.
[1805.04] I am not like papa! He's so sissy!
[1807.96] What did you say?
[1809.12] Yes, he's a sissy. Everyone says this.
[1811.76] He's not my hero.
[1812.96] - I'll slap you, Ali-
- What are you doing?
[1815.84] Leave me.
[1816.64] You're not my papa.
[1818.56] Who taught you that? Come here!
[1823.08] He's just...
[1933.04] Can I sit here with you please?
[1935.20] No.
[1936.12] Please let me sit here.
[1939.80] Sit.
[1946.92] My name is Raaim Bilal and yours?
[1949.28] Ali Shameem.
[1950.44] Shameem? That's a funny name.
[1953.28] Okay, sorry. Can I show you something?
[1961.28] Mobile. It's not allowed in here.
[1963.96] Doesn't matter,
[1964.96] my father can bring the
entire school down with a punch.
[1969.16] No one can stop me.
[1972.16] See, that's my dad.
He's a weight-lifting champion.
[1977.00] Good morning teacher!
[1982.04] Thank you, teacher!
[2005.08] You haven't brought Ali from school yet.
[2009.00] Shameem?
[2010.44] It's your job to bring him home now.
[2014.04] Why me?
[2020.00] He's just a kid. Don't mind him.
[2024.60] But he is right.
[2028.28] He must hate seeing
me in front of his friends.
[2051.28] Yay!
[2053.60] How are you my tiger?
[2056.12] - Huh?
- Good.
[2095.52] Ali, check where papa is.
[2098.00] I don't care.
[2101.56] Ali, go and check.
[2104.12] Can't you see I am busy?
[2105.80] Ali, I've been controlling
myself only because of your father.
[2109.48] If you misbehave again,
[2110.88] I will set you straight for good!
[2113.08] Go check where he is.
[2117.36] Get up.
[2171.04] What is your problem?
[2172.28] Why are you calling now?
What do you want?
[2174.36] Aunty, where is Ali?
[2178.24] Who?
[2180.04] This is Raaim.
[2198.84] Fatima, you went to
bathe without hot water.
[2205.08] I told you the geyser isn't working.
[2207.68] I told your father to get it fixed.
[2210.04] But he never listens.
[2212.16] Take this water.
Don't bathe with cold water.
[2215.28] Or you'll catch a fever.
[2217.16] Don't need it, mother.
I've grown used to it.
[2221.00] I know there was no one to look after you.
[2223.32] But now I will look after you.
[2225.48] Take it.
[2226.44] Don't need it, mother.
[2254.36] Ali, I've said a dozen times,
don't use my mobile.
[2258.20] But you don't listen.
[2259.56] I was texting Raaim, mom.
[2262.04] See, he sent his dad's picture.
[2264.80] He's so cool.
[2266.08] Why is papa not like him?
[2267.88] Shut up, Ali, with whose permission
did you give Raaim my number?
[2271.24] He's my best friend, mama.
[2272.80] You won't talk to Raaim again,
return my phone.
[2274.92] Why? What is your problem?
[2276.44] This is your last warning,
[2278.04] I won't tolerate your misbehaviour.
[2279.28] Understood.
[2280.92] And I don't want Raaim texting me.
[2282.84] Okay, I will give him papas.
[2285.04] If I can't talk to Raaim
then I will not talk to anyone.
[2315.76] Shameem...
[2321.08] Hmm?
[2323.24] I want to talk to you.
[2325.92] Is there a problem?
[2332.04] I was thinking of changing Ali's school.
[2339.04] Why?
[2341.84] It's a good school.
[2345.68] Remember how tough it was
getting him enrolled in this school.
[2350.88] It's a good school,
[2353.12] but I feel he's not in good company.
[2356.32] I am not happy.
[2364.04] This was bound to happen someday.
[2368.24] He's growing up.
He understands things now.
[2373.76] Whenever his friends see me with him,
they tease him.
[2382.00] He must feel embarrassed.
[2385.04] There's no point in changing school.
[2387.12] - I should change myself-
- You don't have to change yourself...
[2391.16] Ali needs to understand.
[2394.24] What does he know about you?
[2398.84] I think he'll change
if he's in better company.
[2402.44] He'll change.
[2404.28] Believe me,
I'm trying to make myself better.
[2409.88] To make myself worthy of him.
[2411.64] Why? Don't say that.
[2416.08] And no need to change.
[2421.20] Change is not easy.
[2425.08] I know.
[2428.24] You won't change,
[2431.48] You're better the way you are.
[2443.24] Ali was growing apart from Shameem,
[2445.84] and closer to Bilal due to Raaim.
[2449.68] I didn't know how to tell Shameem.
[2455.88] Ali...
[2458.76] My child who couldn't
imagine a moment without me,
[2465.76] was now beginning to hesitate.
[2473.04] I had now become an embarrassment for him.
[2480.28] And it wasn't his fault.
[2487.44] He had to grow up someday.
[2493.00] Fathers are a superhero for their child.
[2504.04] And with my personality,
[2510.96] I could've never fit his hero image.
[2518.88] How could I become his ideal?
[2534.24] Papa!
[2535.64] Papa!
[2536.44] Papa!
[2538.68] Come on.
[2540.64] Come on, boys.
[2543.08] Papa!
[2548.28] Come on, boys.
[2556.24] Papa!
