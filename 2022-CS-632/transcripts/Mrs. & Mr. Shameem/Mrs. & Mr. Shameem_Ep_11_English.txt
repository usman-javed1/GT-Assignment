Slow down, please.
What's wrong with you? If I leave this serum
in your hair for too long, then your silky
hair will turn crude. Bravo.  You're done, get out. Asif, you attend to him. Please go with him. Are these fat,
ugly men my only clients now? You can't have
your way around here. Otherwise, I'll throw you out. Why are you so annoyed with me? I wasn't going to bite him. He's such a cute guy. Why are all men blind? And look who's attending to him, that ugly, bald guy. If any client complains about you, I will throw you out. If you weren't good at your job, I would've never employed you. I'm good at other jobs too. Try me. Get lost. Aren't you getting
addicted to smoking? Mom, can I tell you something? Tell me. Let's go on the roof. Why? Tony. What have I done now? Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Tony! Happy birthday to you! Tired? Yes... Thank you so much. Made me really happy. No one has celebrated my
birthday in all these years. Not even your family? Who accepts an embarrassment? They are dead to me. I had a childhood friend, he was like me. But these girls are a bi*** They have no integrity. She swapped my guy
from under my nose. Bi*** Since that day, I lost faith in love
and friendship. But why? This is not by choice. Ask yourself. Do you like this by choice? My uncle had a friend. He used to love me a lot. He would bring chocolates,
toys, toffees, everything. Every day. One day he took me home. To show me a new toy. He took me inside
the room and locked it. I cried inconsolably. I didn't know what was happening. Later I complained about him.
Told them everything. Instead, I was... Well... Later I grew used to it. Now it's a part of me. What is this? Shameem, I told you my
love story as a rape story, and you got emotional. "Now it's a part of me." You get emotional so quickly. I shared my story with you because, you're like me. Although I know you detest me. But I like you. Can I say something? Will you be my friend? What are you doing, Fatima? Why are you doing it? I know I'm wrong, but I want to do something wrong. When you know it's wrong then why? If you love that guy,
Fatima, then tell me, - I'll talk to your family.
- Love? That bloody hoodlum? So what is all this? I'm just being cheap. Are you angry with someone? Furious? Talk to me, Fatima. Tell me whatever is on your mind. I want to help you out. - Please.
- You couldn't even help yourself, how can you help me? And anyway,
I don't need anyone's help, to destroy my life. Why do you want to destroy yourself? Is it something sister-in-law
Rukhsana said? Brother Abdullah? He's your father.  I know he's got a temper, but
he only wants good things for you. If you're trying to rebel
against him, then don't. Even you rebelled against everyone. Then why shouldn't I? Fatima had sworn to doom herself,
only to rebel against brother Abdullah. On the other hand, Wajeeha, who was suffering from an inferiority
complex, was slowly losing her mind. I'm crazy about you, Wajeeha. You are my life. Liar. You are such a flirt. The truth, I swear, Wajeeha. Without you, I'll be dead. You're lying, aren't you? Just like you lied
to me the other day. No, Wajeeha, see. Your eyes,
your hair, your nose are so cute. You're lying again. You don't like me at all. Greetings. Greetings, sir. How are you? I am good.
How are you? I am great. So tell me? I want to style my hair. And? And a massage as well. Okay. Give me five minutes. Tony will attend to
you as soon as he's free. Tony. Stupid. Thank you very much. Shameem's friendship with
Tony was getting deeper every day. He would now come over
to our house every day. Whenever he would come over. He would take over the entire house,
kitchen, and family members. Just like in the Hindi movies... ...I will curse you. Why did you go to the temple alone? Let my son come home,
he will teach you a lesson. Enjoy your meal. I had no friend before him, except for Umaina. No, not today. But now, she was my wife. And I needed a friend like him. Someone who was almost like me. Even Tony was yearning for familial love, which he found in my family. Just kidding. You have a big heart. Hats off to you, Umaina. You should share some tips
with Humaira as well.  Hmm? You're such a glutton. Right there.  Yes. At least close the door,
don't spoil my appetite. Go die somewhere else. Stop it.
Even my food stinks of puke now. Listen... Take me to the doctor. I think I am... What do you think? I think... How dare you? How dare you? What nonsense are you talking about? Whose child is this? How can you get pregnant? Why are you abusing me? You kept abusing me when
I couldn't get pregnant, and even when I am pregnant. Why? - Why can't I get pregnant?
- Who have you been sleeping with? This is not my child. Stop accusing me! Since I am your wife,
this is your child. He's not!  He cannot be my child. Who have you been sleeping with? Otherwise, I will tell everyone.  It doesn't matter where
I got it from. You wanted a child.  Here it is. What is the problem now? I will not raise him.
I will not accept him. Why won't you accept him? I am your wife. What reason will you
give that he's not your child? Because he cannot be my child. Why not? That Reshma, that sweeper,
and that woman from LG Road, when I couldn't get her pregnant,
how can you... You're laughing. Humaira, have you lost your mind? I'll slap you. Bloody impotent! I didn't tell anyone about
Fatima even though I wanted to. But how long could it stay a secret? One day brother Abdullah found out. Hit me!  Hit me! Skin me alive for all I care! You don't need to take the trouble. This...
This is how one's skinned alive. Take a look.  Take a look. Why didn't I die before seeing this? Why didn't you die,
you shameless man? What are you doing? Where did you learn
to speak like this? Who else but that Umaina? I told you a dozen times not to take my
daughter among those shameless people. I only wanted the best for her. - I made her a religious scholar.
- A religious scholar, huh? Where were you when I used to cry, and scream not to send
me to those monsters! Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about? The same man whose hands you kiss? Those same hands dishonoured me! From here, and here. For God's sake, stop it! Shameless, if you have no shame, at least don't spoil
someone else's reputation. What honor, father? I don't have any honor left. You have a good sense of humor. Don't you dare! Don't you dare touch my daughter! I think that at least talk to Tony once. But how is this possible, Bay ji? What do you mean how is it possible? Wajeeha has all the
qualities of a wife. Apart from everything
else he's always coming over, he's your friend. Why can't you talk to him? But Bay ji, Tony is... What? I know. Aren't you? Come on. You keep Umaina so happy. Shower so much love. He's your friend. What if he treats
Wajeeha the same way? With love and care. At least take a chance. You're being impossible now. Umaina, he always listens to you. Wajeeha likes Tony. Tony... I am gay, I swear. Like gay. Like, I can't be a lesbian. I can't... Humaira. Humaira. Who is it? Who is that ba**** For God's sake, Humaira, tell
me whose child this is? What happened? Are you feeling jealous? Why? I've been enduring
your affairs for so long. And you can't endure
a little philandering- You call this little!
I'll punch you in the... If this is really so unimportant, then why don't you tell me? Tell me. - Do you want to know?
- Yes. Okay, fine.  I'll be honest with you. I am...not pregnant. What nonsense is this? Are you really not pregnant? Then why were you humiliating me? I'll slap you, [ __ ]. No more abuses. I won't endure any more abuses. This could have been done
more respectfully. But I am done giving you respect. You couldn't digest it. You considered my fidelity
as my weakness and exploited me. But not anymore. The secret is out now. I won't take any more insults. And you know what I am capable of. What can you do? You men can only threaten us. You're crossing your limit... Are you threatening me, hmm? The day I decide to humiliate you, I'll strip you naked in public. I'll tell everyone. By the way, I am a woman. Even if I don't bear
a child I'll still be a woman. But you're a man. Imagine what will
happen to your pride. Did you ever give it a thought? What will it make you? From a virile man to being unmanly. Useless man! How far should we walk? Don't I look cute already. If I lose any more weight,
the entire city will go crazy for me. For God's sake,
Tony, stop your whining. Shameem. These things are
necessary for good health. For God's sake, Tony, why are you
always having such vile thoughts? He's such a cute guy, Shameem. Forget him,
he looks so dirty and old. - Come on.
- He doesn't look old at all. And I like dirty boys. I will get his number today. For God's sake, why do
you always behave like a wh*** Tony , please be decent
when I'm around. - Come on.
- Be descent you say. Like being decent would
fetch me any medals. This is how you
get the number, watch. What are you doing? Come on. What has happened, Lord? What happened? I always wanted the
best for my daughter. I always wanted my daughter to be... To be my stairway to heaven. This is not what I
had imagined for her, Lord. Lord...please show her the right path. Please show her the right path. And save me from this humiliation. Lord...please save me
from this humiliation. You know I cannot be blamed
for what happened to my daughter. Lord, please... O Lord, save my daughter. Your greed for heaven
turned our lives into hell. Will you be accepted in heaven now? Never! Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me! Why did you bring me
to this isolated place? Couldn't you find
someplace brighter? What's on your mind? What fantasies? Come on, tell me. I want to kill you, rascal! But I am giving you one more chance. Mend your ways.
Or I'll have you gang raped. Come on.  Let's go. At least tell us how this happened?
Who beat you up? I kept telling him to mend his ways. - But he never listens.
- Calm down. Are you happy now? Isn't this what you wanted? Look at your condition now. They almost beat you to death. What else could I do? I was helpless. Those scoundrels beat me up, and also took my money. They even took my silver chain... I recently bought a Chinese phone. Rascals took that too. Let's go to the Police
Station and file a report. No use.  They too will beat me up. What will I tell them? What was I doing there? They don't treat
us like human beings. We're worse than insects
in their view. Even mangy curs have
more respect than us. Get rid of these thoughts. Come on. God bless you. Stop it.  Stop it. Don't worry,
everything will be fine. Don't worry, I'll... What's wrong with Tony? You can share with me. I know Tony needs you,
and you need him. And if there's anything
between you two- Have you lost your mind! Who do you think I am? Don't be furious. How could you even
imagine such a thing? - Sorry.
- I accept he's my friend, but that doesn't mean... I am sorry, Shameem.  I am sorry. - I'll throw him out of the house tomorrow.
- No, no, I won't have any
relationship with him ever. Okay, I shouldn't
have said such a thing. It's my fault.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. Don't be angry. I'm just concerned
that you look worried. I am sorry. Don't spoil your mood. What happened? These Titu company
blades that you purchase, are already getting
a lot of complaints. God, steam isn't going to help. You own such a big salon, and look how dirty your face is. I like even dirty. Let me shape you up a little. I feel very irritated. What are you doing?
For my sake, please. - I don't need it.
- It's overgrown. - It's looking very dirty.
- I'm telling you... I'm just making it look neater. What are you doing? Why are you moving? I am bleeding now. Don't use a towel,
it will get septic. Hold on. Stop it. Move your hand. I told you Ali likes it this way. No, no wait. Leave it.  Just leave me like this. - Keep your hand over here.
- Leave it. I am sorry. I'm telling you
Ali likes it this way. I am sorry. I don't want to be neat. Tony wasn't keeping well those days. He had to be taken
to the hospital frequently. He stopped coming to the salon. I tried to contact him, but, he disappeared without a trace. Fatima! How is Fatima? Fatima?  Where is Fatima? Shameem, please save my child, this man will kill her. Stop it. If anything happens to my child, I will not spare you. This is not the place
to say such things. Did you arrange for blood? I can donate blood.  Show me where? - Please come with me.
- Let's go. She will be fine, please.
Please, sister-in-law. Mr. Shameem. Yes. I'm afraid you can't donate blood. Why? Our entire family
has the same blood group. You're right,
but please try to understand. I don't understand. I am really sorry to tell you,
Shameem, you are HIV positive. And here's your report.
