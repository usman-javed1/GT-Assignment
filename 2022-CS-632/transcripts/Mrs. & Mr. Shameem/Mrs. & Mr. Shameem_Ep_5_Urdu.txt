- Enough, Bayji, I've had enough.
- No, son, this isn't right. Look here... We all apologise to you. I take Shammo's guarantee. He will
fall at your feet and apologise. But don't leave like this
in a fit of rage. This is no way. Please Bay ji,
he will apologise for your sake. But the inhibitions are gone. You should see how sons-in-law
are treated in other families. But here,
we were humiliated for a cheap girl. Shammo.
Shammo, come here. Come here and apologise. Hurry up.
We cannot anger him. - Bay ji...
- Apologise to him, come on. - See he's apologising.
- Sorry. See... You said he'll fall at his feet.
But he's still standing. Shammo. Forgive him. Where are you two going? Bay ji, I thought if Umi visits
her parents for a couple of days, it will be a change for her as well. Parents? What parents? No one attended her wedding. Yes. You made a good decision, dear. Very good decision, dear. Very good decision, dear. You didn't make anything for the journey?
Buy something on the way then. Buy something nice
for her on the way. Safe journey. And give my regards
to everyone at home. Go on, dear. God bless you, child. Safe journey. Give my regards... Come in. What are you looking at? Whose is it? Whose? Yours? Are you serious? Obviously, I'm serious. No one will throw you out of here. Not from here or my life. Take your pills on time. Shameem, wait. Thank you. You took special care of my Umaina. You really are a good friend to her. And do visit us. I missed you terribly. I thought of you... Let's go home. What happened? Umaina. Umaina, what happened? Umaina I am... What happened?
What happened? What's wrong with you? Bilal, leave me! You're hurting me! What's wrong with you? Have you lost your mind? Are we doing it for the first time? What's wrong with you? I don't want it. I don't want this. Umaina! Umaina! Why did I come back, I still wonder. Bilal was in front of me. Shameem had made my
illegal relationship.. legal with our marriage. But I still didn't stop. You may say that I
was in love with Shameem. But that was not the case. I wasn't in love with him yet. But yes, I started to trust him... ...again. Shameem won my trust again. I had started acting mature. One thing that I
learned from Shameem, a man who cannot respect a woman... is good for nothing. Maybe that's why
I left Bilal that day. I had him but still lost him. No. No, I didn't lose him. I left him. You must be tired. Get some rest and I will find out how long for dinner. I am hungry too. Shameem... I am very tired. Won't you massage me today? Umi. Umi. I don't want him. Doctor, the patient is in labor. Take her to the labor room. And please leave her hand. Are you with Mrs. Umaina? Yes. Who are you to her? I...I am her husband. Congratulations. It's a son. Come with me to the nursery. Let's go. Bed number three. Bilal... Bilal... Do you like kids? Whose? Who else? I am talking about human children. I like puppies more. Come on. I've no interest in a human child. How is that possible? Who doesn't have
an interest in children? I... I like girl children. I love children. Whenever I see any child, I shower my love on them. I was wondering how much
I will love our own children. Our children? Yes. How many do you have on your mind? - Close to a dozen.
- Dozen? Do you want more? I am not a Maulvi, you know. I will awaken the Maulvi inside you,
sweetheart. Just take a step first. I want a child. How would you feel if your sins,
remorse, mistakes, and punishment is kept before you as a living piece of meat. That's how I felt about him. He was born in this world, but like an undesired,
unwanted object. Just like his mother. God, he's so cute. Umi. Look at him. Look at how cute he is. Like the moon. Bless him. Umi. Umi. Umi. Look at him. I don't want to see him, Shameem. Take him away or
else I will kill him. What are you doing? Umi... Is Rukhsana awake? Tell her to get ready
if she wants to come with me. And listen,
let's go to the hospital. No, not me, Bay ji. Take Rukhsana with you. Come along.
Learn to share other's joys. Don't be like this. Maybe God will answer your prayers. Fine, don't go.
Go home. I'll go with Rukhsana. Go home and take care of lunch. And anyway, I've to buy
some clothes for the child. What's wrong? Hey. Take me along. Why did I have to get married
into such a disgusting family! Quiet! I don't want to hear you cry!
Quiet! What happened, Abdullah?
What's the matter this time? Bay ji, go ask Shameem. What has Shameem done this time? Did he misbehave with you again?
I'll talk to him. You guys are in this together. Even you're siding with thieves. Be quiet. Be quiet. I'll slap you. What are you doing?
You should fear God. Why are you hitting the poor thing? Umaina had a baby not her. Everyone's involved
in this disgusting deed. What are you saying, Abdullah? Why are you feeling disgusted
if Shameem's had a child? Amazing, Bay ji, unbelievable. Even you have five children, Bay ji. You know how and
when children are born. Shameem's been married
for only six months! How can he have a baby? Children's are God's blessings, he decides when to
bless someone with a child. Don't you know that my
own Choti was born prematurely? God doesn't bless eunuchs. I am raising this question now. Tomorrow the entire neighbourhood
will raise this question, that your family willing accepts adultery.
What will you do then, huh? Forgive us Lord. Don't bother. All of you covered for the new bride. She doesn't step out of the house.
She's shy. This is how shy she is. Let Shameem return from
the hospital and we'll ask him, whether it's his child or otherwise. Enough. I can give you in writing, even Shameem doesn't know
who the father of this child is. Look, Abdullah, don't talk
nonsense about my grandson. Bay ji, earlier I did
nothing because of our child. But this time I won't
take a minute in divorcing her. And you... If you touch that illegitimate
then I'll show you. Understood! Listen to me...
Listen to me... Doesn't matter whose fault it is,
but I'm the one who gets in trouble. My own family is my biggest enemy. Leave it. Leave it or you'll cut your hand. Don't anyone dare
touch Umaina's child? I cannot lose my
husband for her sake. Mrs Shameem,
are you not feeding the child? This is not right for the child. Is there a problem? There's nothing serious. Everything is fine. Since the child is premature, he cannot digest anything
other than his mother's feed. I tried telling her, but... The nurse did tell me. Mr. Shameem, I want to talk to you,
before I discharge your wife. Please... Yes, doctor. Mr. Shameem, I'm afraid your
wife's in postpartum depression. What? Postpartum depression. Hating your own child.. is like,... a potter smashing his own pottery. That's... postpartum depression. It's also called baby blues. Often women slip into depression
after delivering a child. They feel disgusted and
hateful towards their own child. In fact, they don't hesitate
from taking his life. Although they have no reason for it. But Umi... had a reason. I am talking to you. But I don't want to see your face. Shame on you. Shame on you, Salma! You got married and left, leaving us to deal with this mess. Don't blame me, Bay ji. I didn't tell brother
Shameem to marry her. Your pills, Bay ji. To hell with Bay ji. Can't you stay quiet for a minute? Can't you see I'm
talking to your sister? Your pills, Bay ji! What were you saying?
What were you saying? Who were you two fooling around with, huh? Tell me. Please take your pills, Bay ji. You are just like your father.
You don't have any patience, do you? Sit quietly or else leave. You're using my phone
and also yelling at me. Get lost. Go away, mannerless. Take your phone. Give it back when
you're finished talking. Give it back... See this. You're all the same.
All the same. This is why I wasn't talking to you. I knew you would blame me. I wasn't saying anything... Who do I blame then? Who if not you, huh? You brought her into this house. You used to sneak her in here. You've doomed us all. Now you're living
peacefully with your family. Raising their children. And my only son... my only son... God be with him.
That poor thing. Get lost. Get lost,
I don't want to talk to you. Take it. Take your phone. You know this is how she treats me. - Huh?
- Yes. I don't want to have it. Come, Umi. Come in. Come on. Come on. Bay ji... Bay ji, look who is here? Look how cute your grandson is. Like a piece of butter. Bay ji, this is not done. Why didn't anyone
come to the hospital? Bay ji? Bay ji? What's wrong with everyone? Why isn't anyone congratulating me? Choti, get up. Come hold him. Humaira, look. Look how adorable he is. I was thinking... Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations on your child! Come on. Come, let's go to our room. What's the matter?
Why are you all here? Oh wonderful. A child is born in this family , but I've never seen
such silence before. No child has been born. You're mistaken.
Get lost. Don't be so naive, brother. One should take the blessings
of a eunuch, not our curse. I'll take gold earrings. And I'll take only gold
bracelets from the father. - I'll give you bracelets.
- I am the father. God bless you. I am so happy to know. He's stolen my heart. God bless you. You are so handsome. Stay blessed. I want to fly towards you,
although I know I am no use to you. God bless you.
Time to empty your pockets, handsome. Let's celebrate first. Water? Get this out of my way. Eunuchs are dancing outside! There's a celebration going
on outside. Did you see it? Leave it. Don't pay any attention. I want to break their jaws. And especially yours. What have I done? That's the problem,
you can do nothing. Chammo has become a father. Chammo! But I'm yet to be blessed. Lord, you had to pick this barren
woman for me over everyone else. You've made me worse than a eunuch. I didn't do it intentionally. Do you want me to
be like Umaina too? I don't care what you do.
But I want a child. - It's not in my control.
- I don't care. But listen carefully, I won't stay here
and be embarrassed. I will leave. And I will divorce
you first before I leave. What are you doing here? Why are you here? I'll be wherever he'll be. No, you're not real. It's my imagination. Oh, my sweet woman. This is anything but imagination. It's a living example of our love, and all those beautiful moments. There was never any love.
It was all a lie. It was so easy for you to dump me. How easily you forgot about me? But why can't I stop
thinking about you? But Umaina, I... never left you. Nor did my memories. I'll be always here next to you. When he grows up you'll
see my image in him. He'll have my eyes, in which you used to drown with love. Remember the way you looked at me. His lips will have my smile on them. And the desire to kiss them. I'll be wherever he'll be. Right here next to you. Go away! I said go away! And take him with you. I don't want your child,
you, or your love. I don't want anything.
Get out of here! He would scream and cry all day. As if he was trying
to make his existence felt. He would remind me of my sins,
mistakes, and helplessness. But I had my ears all shut. I was completely indifferent
to my sense of motherhood. Him screaming with
hunger and helplessness, was actually making me happy. He was the reason for my doom. At a time when everyone else,
including me, had denied his existence, Shameem became a father to him. Or better yet, a mother to him. It seemed like he was
born from Shameem's existence. Even a little restlessness
would worry Shameem completely. Add some sugar to it. Bay ji, the doctor said no. To hell with the doctor. Come on. I wonder what spell Umi and her
child has cast on brother Shameem. No one else exists for him anymore. Earlier he would
bear all my tantrums. And now he completely ignores me. He was the only one
who cared about me. Now he's not there either. We thought he'll feel isolated
if we don't talk to him. But he's isolated us. We are nothing to him.
His child is everything to him. Bay ji, how can anyone
love his child so much? Pray that it's his. Umi. Umi. Look, I've brought
sweetmeat for you. Made in clarified butter. You'll love it. Here, eat it. Eat it. I've heard from elders
that after a woman gives birth, she's literally on her deathbed. So she should take
extra care of herself. But you don't take care of yourself. But doesn't matter. You have me. So you don't have to worry. You know Rukhsana, I took care of her
when she had Fatima. I know how to do everything. Have you seen Ali? I take such good care of Ali. So you don't have to worry. I'll handle everything. Get up. Enough of your tantrums. I made this especially for you. Get up. Come on. Umi, why are you doing this? Umi, what are you doing with him? Leave him. Leave him. - He's not your child, leave him.
- The water is cold! - Let him die.
- You will kill him. Let him die. I want him to be dead. Are you crazy, Umi? Go away. Leave him. I won't give him. Umi... You should be scared of God. You've lost your mind. You can do whatever
you want to yourself. But don't you dare touch him! Madwoman! What do you want to do? How can you be so cruel? I've been treated cruelly too. Did anyone take pity on me? No. Why should I take pity on him? Why are you punishing
him for your bad decisions? How can I punish him? He's my punishment. If it wasn't for him,
Bilal would still be with me. Bilal. Bilal again. Move ahead. He has a right on you. And he didn't ask
for your permission... Illegitimate relationships
have no rights. Illegitimate? Take one good look at him. He's beautiful as an angel. Angel. He's the son of the devil. This ba**** is no one to me. Enough, Umi. He's already sick because of you. You don't even feed him. - If this continues-
- Let him die for all I care. Take him away. I don't
want to see his wretched face. For God's sake, please... But how can I, alone... You like to play God. Then go ahead. I've no relationship with him. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Your mother is a queen, Your father is a king, There's a golden door for the prince, Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How? I wonder what you are! Umi, what are you doing? What are you doing? Have you lost your...
Umi, open the door. Umi. Umi. You're so cruel.
Do you have no shame? No, no, son. Stop crying. Stop crying. No, no. Stop crying, my prince.
I'm here now. I'm here now. Stop crying. Umi, open the door.
