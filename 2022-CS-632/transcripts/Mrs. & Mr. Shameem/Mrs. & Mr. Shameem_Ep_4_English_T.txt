[110.88] What's this?
[112.32] On your neck?
[114.24] Ohh...love bite.
[117.64] It's the stamp of love.
[120.16] Wow.
[121.68] You're not some product
that needs to be stamped.
[127.36] What are you saying?
[128.88] We love each other.
[132.80] It's not love, it's lust.
[137.04] Are you jealous?
[138.52] My green-eyed monster.
[139.72] Don't you have
anything better to do?
[143.32] Doesn't matter.
[145.80] And what do you know about love?
[150.88] Why?
[153.00] Am I not human?
[155.44] I don't have a heart.
[156.72] Surely you're human, but...
[160.32] You get my point.
[162.32] How do I say?
[166.08] Let me explain to you in detail.
[168.28] When two lovers are
in each other's company,
[171.76] they have no control
over themselves or time.
[175.80] And a lover's touch
changes your physical form,
[180.36] turns everything into a fantasy.
[182.16] You begin to flow with each other.
[184.00] Pass through each other.
[186.08] Meaning, you're unaware of what's happening,
or what people are thinking.
[192.12] Everything just feels nice.
[195.84] Didn't understand, did you?
[197.00] I don't want to learn the kind of love
that starts and ends with being physical.
[202.20] Two people can be in a relationship,
when there's love, emotions,
[207.24] respect for each other.
[212.04] You'll be looking for respect,
and someone will rob you of it.
[215.72] But I guarantee you one thing,
[217.72] no woman is ever going to love you.
[219.96] Promise.
[234.08] Listen?  Are you sure?
[239.88] I liked to be a Love guru.
[242.56] I would keep talking,
and he would listen.
[248.28] I thought he didn't
know anything about love.
[256.04] I was crazy.
[260.20] But the aspects of love he knew
[264.40] were unheard of by me.
[270.08] I felt love.
[274.28] But him.
[278.32] He lived it.
[317.12] We're getting married in two days,
[319.84] and I came over to invite you.
[323.68] If you can attend the wedding,
[328.12] it will make Umi very happy.
[330.88] She will be completely ecstatic.
[333.64] I don't care about how she feels.
[342.68] Please leave.
[348.00] I am talking to you.
[357.16] I know you're angry, but-
[359.28] I said leave!
[370.88] And take this too.
[419.32] I accept.
[445.72] Congratulations.
[502.72] Call me if you need
any kind of help.
[506.52] Give me a missed call.  I am awake.
[578.16] I don't know what to say.
[584.52] Even though I knew what
we were going to talk about,
[588.76] I am clueless now.
[597.64] Umi, you don't have to
worry anymore.
[601.84] Now, this is your home,
your room, and...
[613.80] I am yours too.
[620.80] You're looking cute.
[623.88] Very cute, I swear.
[629.60] I knew you would look
gorgeous as a bride.
[635.08] And see...
[642.72] You like taking pictures, don't you?
[646.24] Come on, let's take a selfie.
[666.04] I know what you're thinking.
[671.12] You must be thinking
[674.92] what a weird wedding this was.
[678.56] No wedding band, no wedding guests.
[683.04] What a boring wedding.
[688.48] The life of every party had such
a dull wedding.
[692.04] This is what's going
on in your mind, right?
[710.16] Look, I got a ring for you.
[711.96] - Give me your hand.
- Stay away!
[715.84] I feel stifled in this wedding
dress, this house, and this family.
[720.56] If you touch me again,
[722.08] I'll sacrifice myself and you too!
[731.04] - Umi-
- Go away!
[734.08] Leave!
[801.60] Bilal, please talk to me.
[803.80] Please talk to me.
[816.68] I know you are checking my messages.
[819.12] Why aren't you answering my calls?
[821.04] I'm prepared to do whatever you say.
[823.48] Please forgive me,
I know I was wrong.
[825.40] I will never get angry
with you ever again.
[826.88] Talk to me.
[833.84] Shammo, come here.
[839.48] What is this?
[841.28] I've been watching for two weeks,
[842.96] like some servant you've
been taking trays to her room.
[846.08] She doesn't step out of her room.
[850.64] She hasn't been keeping well.
[859.04] Curse her.
[860.88] What illness lasts this long, huh?
[869.56] If you want me to be your keep,
then I'm ready for that as well.
[873.84] Please get me out
of this hell, please.
[888.76] What happened?
[890.40] All okay?
[895.04] I'm fine when you're not around.
[898.36] Try not to show your face.
[904.60] You don't eat properly.
[908.24] At least eat something
for the sake of this child.
[912.76] This child has made my life hell.
[915.12] I wish he dies-
[919.68] For God's sake, don't say
such things when I'm around.
[923.00] Why?  What does he mean to you?
[925.64] Why are you worried about
him when his father isn't?
[928.68] And you think you own me now.  No!
[933.68] You still have no right over him!
[935.52] I am not asserting
my right over anyone.
[937.88] I'm begging you.
[940.68] You've locked yourself
inside this room for 15-days.
[943.20] You don't step out at all.
[944.68] Go out, face the world.
[947.80] And you don't have to
feel embarrassed anymore.
[954.44] Face the world after marrying you?
[957.20] Don't you get it?
Everyone makes fun of me.
[960.24] Face the world?
[963.00] I would rather have
died on the streets.
[965.12] You should've left me there.
[969.04] I loathe you.
[989.60] Give me a holler
when you finish eating.
[991.16] I'll come and collect the plates.
[992.40] You have no shame at all.
[994.60] I've been humiliating you,
but you feel no shame.
[997.40] Don't you have any shame?
[998.68] Then listen to this.
[999.80] I was sending voice notes
to Bilal before you arrived.
[1001.92] You should hear the last one,
for your own satisfaction.
[1004.32] "If you want me to be your keep," "
[1006.60] then I'm ready for that as well."
[1008.60] "Please get me out of this hell,
please."
[1011.52] I will do it,
and you will do nothing but watch.
[1015.16] You think you own me now.
[1017.84] Take this away and
get some poison instead.
[1035.04] I had so many dreams.
[1036.84] I thought that room would
be mine after Salma's wedding.
[1040.24] And I'll finally be
free of Bay ji's snoring.
[1043.32] But it's my bad luck.
[1045.40] You're worried about your room, but
the entire manor is at stake here.
[1049.32] I've doubts about
Umaina's intentions.
[1052.48] Marry a guy like Shammo.
[1055.52] Why would a smart
girl like her marry him?
[1059.12] Lord, only you can
protect this family.
[1064.16] Hasn't your useless husband
been occupying this house as well?
[1067.28] That freeloader.
[1070.20] Everyone has complaints
about my husband.
[1074.00] No one wants to see me settle down.
[1076.44] Since I have no children,
that means I have no rights either.
[1080.00] My husband and I are the only bad people
here, and everyone else is God's sheep.
[1083.36] You never take notice of your
daughter-in-law, or her attitude!
[1086.04] She doesn't even
talk to you directly,
[1087.44] or even step out of her room.
[1089.44] Humaira is right.
[1091.44] She doesn't talk to anyone.
[1093.52] She always stays
locked up in her room.
[1095.36] Is this how she is
repaying your kindness?
[1098.48] Tell your son he can't be like that.
[1100.48] What do I do?
[1102.40] What do I do?  What do you want?
[1104.64] Strangle my son's happiness.
Tell him to divorce her.
[1108.64] Listen...
[1109.52] Listen, Rukhsana, what do you want?
[1112.04] Do you want my son to treat
his wife as your husband treats you?
[1116.48] I am the unlucky one!
[1118.32] I ended up with a
cruel husband and an uxorious brother.
[1121.28] I wish I too had an uxorious husband.
[1125.16] We can see now.
We're not children anymore.
[1127.72] Even I have children.
[1129.64] And legal ones.
[1130.92] Stop talking.  Stop talking nonsense!
[1133.28] Why?  Why should we shut up?
[1135.52] Thank God our husband
didn't get suspicious,
[1137.24] or else they would've humiliated us!
[1139.36] You guys are hiding hideous
acts of harlotry and adultery.
[1141.64] Disgusting.  God forgive me.
[1143.64] You pray with such a filthy mind?
[1147.40] Now you know why your
prayers never get answered.
[1150.80] I am telling all of you,
you can't see my son happy.
[1155.20] Happy?
[1156.48] But I don't see any happiness here?
[1159.04] Brother's face always looks pale.
[1161.36] I wonder what Umaina does with her.
[1164.84] Get down.  Get down and get lost.
[1177.84] Umi.
[1180.80] Umi.
[1181.92] What happened?
[1183.68] Calm down.
[1186.36] Here.  Clean with this.
[1191.48] Umi.
[1192.80] Come on.  Come quickly.
[1220.44] Move faster.
[1223.68] Bay ji, she is here.
[1226.16] - Greetings.
- Greetings.
[1227.88] Where is your daughter-in-law?
[1229.12] Let me tell you.
[1230.56] If it's good news, then I'll accept
nothing less than gold bracelets.
[1233.40] She is that way.
[1234.84] What are you doing here, Naseeba?
[1236.76] Bay ji.
[1238.32] Shammo, Umaina isn't feeling well,
and I thought she might-
[1243.40] What did you think?
[1247.88] - Leave.  Get out.
- I only came to give good news,
[1251.16] and this is how I get treated.
[1252.80] - Are you watching this?
- I am watching everything.
[1254.80] Wait just a minute.
What misbehavior is this?
[1256.08] What misbehavior is this, Shammo?
[1257.56] Don't you remember, even Fatima...
[1259.60] What are you trying to find
all the time?
[1262.16] What is your problem?
[1268.80] What is the matter?
[1270.84] You wanted to marry her,
and I agreed.
[1273.80] So what are you hiding from me?
What is it?
[1276.04] We're not blind, Shammo.
[1277.76] We can see everything.
[1279.20] We don't speak up because-
[1281.32] What do you know?  What do you know?
[1284.00] I'll tell you.
[1285.48] She is pregnant!
[1286.92] Are you happy now?
[1288.28] Let's go now.
[1316.44] Be quiet.
[1317.88] Be quiet.
[1319.16] For God's sake, be quiet.
[1322.20] I'm confused myself.
I don't know what to do.
[1325.56] Pregnant?
[1332.24] Destiny has left me completely
embarrassed, Bay ji.
[1339.36] Prayers, venerations,
fasts, things I've done.
[1346.84] But my prayers are never answered.
[1350.00] He doesn't bless me with a child,
but people like Umaina...
[1353.44] Be quiet.  Be quiet.
Cry softly.  Cry softly.
[1358.32] If the men in the house find out,
they will raise a storm.
[1361.40] Your husband will kill you!
Be quiet!
[1389.76] Does everyone know?
[1395.44] It doesn't matter
even if they find out.
[1398.52] He's my child.
[1399.64] He's not your child!  Did
[1401.76] you hear?
[1404.88] Are you listening?
He's not your child.
[1407.24] Why are you lying to everyone?
[1409.88] I won't let you succeed
in your intentions.
[1438.40] Keep it down.
[1441.16] - Come here.
- I'll manage.
[1442.40] Be quiet.
[1447.00] Tilt your head.
[1451.04] Patience!  Patience!
[1453.32] I said be patient.
[1456.32] Turn around.  Relax.
[1462.68] You can't tolerate
a little pain, Shammo,
[1466.00] you know you are playing with fire.
[1468.68] You'll only get burned.
[1471.60] - Enough.
- Look at me.
[1474.40] Can you take the heat?
[1481.16] That's it.
[1486.64] Remember...
[1491.68] When you were a child,
[1496.44] you insisted on having
a black francolin as a pet?
[1503.32] And you locked him in a cage.
[1505.80] She injured herself
trying to escape.
[1509.64] You would apply
ointment all the time.
[1513.68] You couldn't keep him for long.
[1516.64] You cried so much.
How can you forget?
[1524.56] You know she is just like
a black francolin.
[1530.48] She will kill herself
in front of you,
[1534.88] but she won't stay with you.
[1539.44] There's nothing you can do.
[1542.16] There's nothing you can do, Shammo.
[1547.48] Set her free.
[1551.16] Let her go.
[1552.84] Let her go, my child.
Let her go.
[1557.00] Let go of her.
[1559.20] Just let go of her.
[1561.24] No, my child.
[1563.12] No, my baby.
[1567.12] Okay, it's okay.
[1586.32] Enough!
[1599.04] I just want to say,
[1602.52] if you feel,
[1607.56] this marriage was to restrain you,
then you're wrong.
[1616.68] Whenever you want to leave,
you can do so.
[1621.12] No one...
[1625.08] will stop you.
[1629.84] But not now.
[1634.32] Give yourself some time.
[1637.28] Gather yourself.
[1641.72] I'll take you...
[1645.80] wherever you want.
Listen.
[1665.36] Where are you taking me?
[1671.20] Shameem, where are you taking me?
[1674.04] Shameem, stop the car.
[1675.64] Shameem...
[1683.24] Why did you bring me here?
[1684.84] Why?
[1687.04] We've been here
before several times.
[1689.64] Are you trying to embarrass me?
[1691.44] Trying to make me feel small?
[1694.36] What do you want?
[1695.80] Do you want to humiliate me?
[1697.04] I want you to cry.
[1700.04] Yell, scream and release
all the pain in your heart.
[1703.60] Feel unburdened again.
[1704.76] But for God's sake,
be who you used to be!
[1769.24] Umaina.
[1777.08] You look very good.
[1784.68] Shameem.
[1793.68] Please sit.
[1817.64] Umaina...
[1821.16] Look,
[1824.44] I know you're furious with me.
[1827.16] I want you to hit me.
[1828.56] Please Umaina... Please hit me.
[1832.00] I was a coward.
[1834.88] I ran away, and I am really sorry.
[1837.88] But what else could I do?
[1841.04] My parents said
if I don't marry Ruhi,
[1846.00] they will disown me.
[1849.00] What could I do in a situation
like this?  You tell me.
[1853.08] I know they are greedy, I
know they are selfish,
[1857.80] but at the end of the day,
they are my parents.
[1862.16] Even my parents threw me out.
[1865.44] Where do I go now?
[1867.40] What do I do?
[1869.32] Umaina, I am so sorry.
[1873.44] If I knew, I would have accepted
you in front of the world.
[1879.56] I didn't know.
I am really sorry.
[1882.56] - Shameem told me-
- What did Shameem tell you?
[1889.08] What did he tell you?
[1891.88] That your father...
[1897.12] threw you out of the house.
[1901.56] Didn't he tell you
about everything...
[1905.48] else I've been through,
my struggles?
[1910.56] Umaina, look...
[1916.00] If I could go back in time,
[1918.08] I would fix everything,
but I can't.
[1922.72] But I want to fix things with you.
[1926.04] How?
[1927.52] I want to accept you and your child...
[1934.12] I mean our child!
[1936.76] I want us to live
separately in a flat.
[1940.88] You, me and our child.
[1946.52] We'll have a great life.
[1949.16] And I'll keep visiting you.
[1951.92] What do you mean
you'll keep visiting me?
[1954.68] Won't you stay with us?
[1957.20] Look, legally it
would be impossible,
[1961.96] with my parents and my wife around.
[1965.24] With time I can manage.
[1967.04] But immediately it's
going to be difficult.
[1970.32] Bilal, I don't get it.
[1972.64] You're saying you
won't stay with us.
[1975.48] How can I live with you like this?
[1977.56] Look...
[1979.40] You...
[1981.72] texted me and said that you're...
[1987.12] prepared to live with
me in any condition.
[1992.08] You said that, didn't you?
[1994.88] Baby, don't be like that.
[1997.04] Umaina, look at me.
[2000.16] Look at me.
[2001.96] Look at me.
[2003.88] We've had some great times together,
haven't we?
[2038.04] Do you want to get back with Bilal?
[2049.40] I don't know.
[2054.16] I'll have to pay for my mistakes.
[2065.44] I won't divorce you.
[2068.52] No.
[2081.40] So finally you've
shown your true colors.
[2084.60] That's all the goodness
you could pretend to have!
[2091.88] What?
[2093.48] Are you threatening me?
[2095.32] Or blackmailing me?
[2098.04] This marriage has no value for me,
so a divorce cannot stop me.
[2104.52] This time I won't let anyone
come between Bilal and me.
[2107.40] And certainly not you.
[2112.20] I won't divorce you.
[2114.72] Not because I don't
want you to meet with Bilal.
[2118.56] You can meet him whenever you like,
stay with him.
[2122.88] I know this marriage disgusts you.
[2126.32] But it's the only thing
that will protect you.
[2132.80] Bilal will never marry you,
[2137.28] nor accept this child.
[2140.72] But our marriage is
a certificate for you.
[2145.60] No one can point fingers at you.
[2149.04] When the child starts going
to school, he'll need an identity.
[2151.52] And I'll give him that identity.
[2155.00] You don't need to
be scared of anyone.
[2160.32] You can live respectfully
with your child,
[2168.80] whether I'm a part of it or not.
[2177.52] Tell Bilal that...
[2181.40] you're ready.
[2213.92] Get up.
[2215.28] Shameem, get up.
[2217.36] - What?
- Who are you?
[2218.72] Are you God or an angel?
[2220.16] What are you?
[2221.48] What do you think?  I'll be
impressed by you and start crying!
[2224.64] No!  I'll go back to Bilal,
and stoop as low as he wants me to.
[2228.44] But I won't let you play
this game of existence with me.
[2230.48] I am not playing any games!
[2233.40] If you felt insulted by
anything I said, then I apologize.
[2236.36] But my motive
is only in your interest-
[2238.64] Why do you think about my interest?
Why?  Why?
[2242.40] Am I not burdened with
enough sins of my own,
[2244.44] that you want to do
these favors on me?
[2247.28] Why do you want it?
[2249.08] Shameem, you're stooping
lower than me to save me!
[2251.64] Shame on you!
[2253.28] Stop abusing yourself!
[2254.80] You can say anything you want to me.
[2256.76] But it hurts.
[2257.96] Why do you feel pain?
[2259.44] I want to know.
Look at me.  Look at me.
[2262.28] You can't lie to me!
[2264.40] Are you in love with me?
[2266.12] Tell me.
Tell me, Shameem.
[2268.48] Are you in love with me?
[2269.48] It is not your problem.
[2272.52] Go and be happy with your Bilal!
[2275.96] I have nothing to do with you.
[2280.44] I don't want to be an angel or God.
[2286.04] I want to be your friend again.
[2288.76] Try trusting someone.
[2293.08] I have nothing to do with you.
[2295.96] I don't want anything.
[2305.24] I don't know what to do.
[2312.44] Shameem, I'm madly in love with him.
I can't forget him.
[2320.72] Tell me what to do?
[2323.28] Am I doing the right thing, Shameem?
[2327.64] His love has made me blind.
I can't forget him.
[2332.68] Tell me, Shameem.
[2334.88] Tell me, Shameem.
