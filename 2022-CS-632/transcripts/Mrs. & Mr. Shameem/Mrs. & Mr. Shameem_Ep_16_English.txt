- I thought you guys were coming tomorrow.
- Okay. I was over at my in-law's place, - to fix my brother-in-law's wedding.
- Okay.  That's why I got late. I hope you two had
no trouble coming here. No. Need help with that? No, no, it's okay. The place has been
closed for too long. It's in a bad state. I can get it cleaned up. No need, we'll manage. You guys don't have
pillows and blankets either. Can I get some? We'll be grateful if you can If you ever face water problems do
n't hesitate to tell me. Okay. I'll be back in a jiffy. Here's the key. That night felt like... ...we were sleeping in our graves. In your minds,
you had made a huge sacrifice, and buried yourselves in your tombs. But did you ever imagine, what will happen to those
you're leaving behind? Did you ever think about them? Maybe they can't tell you anything about the people they left behind. But there are a couple of
people who faced a lot of problems. Some of them are no longer with us, but to narrate the
other side of the story, I would like to invite Mr.
Shameem's family. Please come to the auditorium. We all know who your
eyes are searching for. Ali, isn't it? I can't read this. You'll have to read it. I didn't cry that day. I was completely quiet. No mischief, or demands, or questions, why did my parents leave me quietly?  That night when I was
knocking on my parent's door, there was a question on my mind, which I had to ask . But I lost courage as
soon as they opened the door. I wasn't ready to
believe at any cost, that my dad isn't my real father. - No.
- Hey! You don't know how to
bathe me properly. Only my dad knows how to
bathe me properly, aunty. Again aunty? I've told you not to call me aunt.
Call me mom. But I won't call him dad. What?  What did he say? Was he abusing me? He doesn't abuse.,
he's a decent kid. Be quiet. What did you say, son? I hate you. I don't like you at all.
I'll never call you dad. I'm not too keen to hear
you call me dad either. Bloody orphan. Don't call him an orphan. Why do you talk to him like this? What else do you call an orphan? Someday he will find out, that even Shameem
isn't his real father! Khurram, - for God's sake, what are... Be quiet.
- Your father left you in the dustbin. I am talking to you, son. He left you in the dustbin. That's where we got you from. Thankless kid! Ali. What have you done? Ali. Whenever mother would scold me, I would say that I am adopted. I was really adopted. Before I could understand
this situation, you two left me as well. Once again! Bay ji's rejection, hatred, was making sense to me. Maybe something was missing in me. Maybe I didn't have
the qualities of a son. Mom, Dad.
I could've told everyone in school... ... that I'm the AIDS kid, and undo everything you did. But no. I didn't do it. Do you know why? Because I loved you a lot. You may be far from me, but I didn't want to cause
you any pain. I didn't want you to die, dad. You always said I
do really good tricks, but you played the best trick on me. Are you hungry? Meaning we're still alive, Umi. I'll arrange for something. Why didn't you eat? I was thinking of Ali. I wonder if he's eaten or not. Humaira is his mother now. She must have fed her. He must have cried inconsolably. What have we decided? We'll never bring up this topic. Look Umi, we can die but we can't be cruel. I miss him and it's painful. When you make a
big decision in life, you have to stay firm on it, Shammo. We've closed all
paths for our return, so let's not cry over it. Have you forgotten all about him? Don't you miss him? I know he gets thirsty at night. He wakes up in the
middle of the night. He doesn't like blue. He's allergic to several things. He cannot digest junk food. I've told Humaira everything. She's his mother now.
She will take care of him. And we won't discuss
this topic again. If I ever start to stagger
then you must stop me. Umi, I thought we're
going to die anyway, so why don't we die comfortably. The evenings in that
region were beautiful. Watching the scarlet sunset, as life slowly faded away. Shameem was right. There was no better place to die. - Greetings, madam.
- Greetings. Sorry, we don't have anything. I am not a beggar, madam. I'm looking for work.
Do you have any work? He's my son. He just tagged along. - I can make him sit at the back if you want.
- No, no, it's okay. - Come here, my child.
- But we don't have any work. I am in desperate
need of work, madam. Any work at all. Cleaning, mopping, waxing, massage. Madam, I can even deliver kids. I am also a midwife in this area. Bablu, come here. Please give me some work, madam. We're in dire straights. We are facing a cash crunch. All our huts are empty. Please give me some work. Sit down, Bablu. I'll ask sir and let you know. Thank you very much, madam. I'll be grateful. Come here, Bablu.
Come on, let's go home. Let's go home, son.
Don't sleep here. My sweet child.  Bravo. Madam, do I get the job? I'll ask sir and let you know. Thank you very much, madam. May Allah bless you with happiness. God bless you. But... We don't need a maid
for such a small place. She was pleading continuously. We stay sick all the time. This way she will get a job, and we'll have an
extra pair of hands. Honestly, Bay ji. Shameem personally gave this to me. Bay ji, if you doubt
Abdullah's intentions, then... Why would I doubt anyone? If Shammo's done this
then he must be right. He's given me such
a big responsibility. Especially the responsibility
of supporting Ali. I wanted to return
everything to him. But I wonder where he disappeared to
after handing this over. God knows where he went. Unbelievable. Even after you treated
him so unfairly and selfishly, he saw some good in you. And even though he
had many good qualities, you couldn't even notice one in him. Clear my space. It's not your father's bed. How are you talking to my son? Your son? This puppy... Ali! Son, go and play outside, okay. Good boy. I'll join you in a while.  Do n't you dare talk
to my son like this, I'll yank your tongue out. You'll yank my tongue out? You begged and pleaded
for me to come back. "I want a child." That rascal Shameem
gave everything to Abdullah. I see? He did the right thing.  Did he do the right thing? Have you lost your mind? Wait a minute.  Wait a minute. Humaira, I hope you aren't fooling me. Was this a trick to get the child? Why?  I am your wife after all. I must have learned
something in your company. All these years you
kept playing tricks on me, don't I deserve to play one on you? Look Humaira,
I'll leave you for good. Then you'll miss me and cry. Okay, go. Anyway,
you couldn't give me a child. So be it. Go on. Don't just stand there
and stare at my face. Leave. Are you drunk? Look Humaira, I am leaving. Do as you please. Enjoy your "child". Where is my bag? Where is my money? Humaira, where's my... Look, don't do this to me. You are my sweet wife. You've kept all my money.  It doesn't matter who keeps the money. But don't throw me out of the house. I don't have a penny.
Where will I go? Not my problem. What's wrong with you? You're a woman.
How will you survive without a man? I'm not alone. I have a son now.  He'll look after me. That rugrat. He can't even clean
himself properly. I'll teach him everything. How a man should be. Not like you, someone who respects women. Like his father Shameem. You want to be his father? Bloody impotent. Enough!  I've heard enough rubbish. If you utter another word, then I'll divorce you. You'll divorce me? Yes, I will. Fine, I divorce you then. Divorce!  Divorce!  Divorce! Go to hell! I think you want to say something. Please give her a mic. If women decide to be firm, no man can ever break her. You got divorced. Didn't you ever feel lonely? A woman feels complete
not by a husband, but by her child. And I had found him. My son. My Ali. And you? According to this,
you made yourself incomplete. How did the loneliness
on that hill station feel? We were honestly very lonely, and also incomplete. But for a change, there was no one between us. Neither Bilal, nor our family, nor Ali. Just the two of us. We had left all the goals
of life behind. We thought life was over for us. But it's very stubborn. You don't even realize
when it bounces back. And makes a relationship
with you like water. Mister, don't you sound weird. People go to the city to find work. What work will you get out of here? I was asking since
this is a tourist area... ...and all the guest
houses and hotels are here. There must be a job here somewhere. Must... You guys are fast learners. There's a guesthouse here. Come with me. Let's go talk to the owner. Come on. Let's go. Hasan? Yes. Who is this man? He's a very interesting man, boss. He is educated and can
handle all the paperwork. No. What if he starts doing
some other work here? No, boss.  He is a good man. What is the term... You won't need to hire
a female receptionist. No, no, I don't want this guy. Go on.  Leave. I don't want this guy. Let me work. Go. Wait a minute.  Stop. Where are you going?
Listen to me. Where are you going? This place is filled with
illiterate and ignorant people. You educated people won't last here. Doesn't matter.
I'll look for a job somewhere else. Don't worry. You guys are always in a hurry. I spoke to the boss. I begged him. He has agreed to hire you. You can join from tomorrow. Okay, thank you very much.
I am obliged. Doesn't matter. Tomorrow morning at 8. Umi. Congratulations, I got a job. Yes. Baaji sir gave me
a job at his guesthouse. Congratulations. They are beautiful. Are you tired? I'll get some water. Madam, why did you
lay him on the bed? He'll soil the bed. Okay, as you wish. Madam, can I ask you
something if you don't mind? Ask. Madam, don't you have children? How long have you two been married? Eight years. Eight years? This shouldn't be
taken lightly, madam. It's not good. Madam... Madam, can I give you an advice? There's a wise old
man who lives close by. He's got a shrine. People come from far
and wide to pray there. It cures even the worst disease. You guys are from the city. I know you won't
believe in such things. But on my advice,
you must visit that place once. By Allah,
madam, your wish will be fulfilled. Can I sleep next to him? He'll soil your clothes. I don't mind. As you wish, madam. Why do you want to go to the shrine? Because I want to. I've never gone anywhere
since we got here. This way we can have a look around. I'm tired. I know. You've put on weight
sitting at home. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Just keep quiet and come with me. Look how beautiful that mountain is. We have to live as
long as we are alive. Maybe even in that spell of despair, we were finding our little joys. Maybe we had left one
door of our desires ajar, and the breeze of love
was provoking us to live again. What did you pray for, Umi? Peace. And you? Justice.
