[90.60] Be good again, my child.
[93.00] I'll be dead if
anything happens to you.
[97.04] God bless you.
[99.32] Why do you take on a
responsibility you can't handle?
[105.24] Give him to me.
[106.60] No, I will take care of him.
[109.68] Leave me alone.
[123.24] Are you angry?
[127.76] Will you not listen, even for him?
[130.76] Give me.
[135.32] I said give me.
[136.96] Don't you get it?
[147.08] Calm down. Calm down.
Oh, he spat some milk out.
[151.92] Look at him.
[155.92] God bless you!
[161.24] Mercy comes with a price.
[169.60] How is it possible, Bay ji?
[172.56] To do mercy one has
to be cruel to himself.
[177.08] No wonder people
never show any mercy.
[180.16] You have to kill your ego.
[183.20] Rules have to be broken.
[188.04] It makes you do many
disgusting things.
[189.88] This is not disgusting, Bay ji.
[197.88] You're right.
[205.76] He's a human being as well.
[214.60] But I am not cruel either, Shammo.
[220.92] I love you.
[224.36] I love you so much.
[227.64] I'll endure even this pain for you.
[233.84] I am your mother after all.
[236.48] That's exactly how
much I love him, Bay ji.
[244.56] You've a very kind heart, Shammo.
[248.40] Very pious, son.
[251.16] But remember,
good deeds should not be wasted.
[259.00] Do you have any clue
about the consequences?
[265.44] Good deeds are never
done with a biased mind.
[270.32] As you say,
[273.80] the real reward of good
deeds is the consequences.
[278.40] I will endure whatever the
consequences are for Ali's sake.
[280.92] - For someone else' child-
- He's not someone else's child!
[285.40] He's mine.
[288.24] Ali is mine alone.
Not even Umi's.
[291.36] Not Umi's.
[294.36] He's my son. Only mine.
[298.44] Right? You are mine, aren't you?
[302.96] These will make a few pairs for him.
[305.92] Okay.
[310.00] It's soft.
[312.40] Beautiful.
[319.00] He will wear it.
[325.32] This is too small.
[336.24] What is this, Bay ji?
[340.16] Will you accept him?
[343.96] Even after you know the truth.
[349.24] If we shower him
with love and comfort,
[353.60] maybe God will bless
my child with happiness too.
[357.32] When God bestowed him with life,
[360.96] who are we to deprive him of it?
[375.04] Water.
[376.76] Fatima, get some
water for your father.
[379.08] I've said a dozen times,
I want water with my food.
[382.76] But does anyone understand?
[387.56] And what kind of bread is this?
[390.40] Do I have to teach you now?
[399.36] Are you blind?
[400.76] Can't you see where you're going?
You've ruined my clothes!
[404.16] What has your mother taught you?
What did she teach you?
[411.28] Don't scold the poor thing.
[413.12] She's still a kid. You scare him.
[415.04] She's even afraid of
getting close to you now.
[417.44] Good. Father and daughter
need to maintain distance.
[421.56] And stop lecturing me all the time.
[424.36] Haven't you seen your family's deed?
[427.20] And your brother,
[428.36] showers his love on
an illegitimate child.
[430.84] Disgusting.
[433.88] He's a better person than you,
[436.48] who treats his own child
like she's illegitimate.
[442.08] - What did you say?
- Nothing.
[444.00] - What did you say?
- Nothing.
[446.64] I didn't hear properly.
[448.36] - Say it. Say it.
- I said nothing.
[450.48] - Well...
- What's making you so audacious?
[452.92] How dare you?
How dare you?
[454.76] No!
[456.32] I don't want to hear
your voice! Quiet!
[560.84] Ali is so fortunate to
have a father like Shameem.
[570.04] If he's fortunate then what
does it mean being unfortunate?
[579.40] I'll tell you what
being unfortunate is.
[583.72] Revering her husband.
[586.28] Following his every order,
every word.
[592.76] And yet see no mercy
for oneself and her child,
[595.52] in her husband's heart.
[604.12] You should value Shameem.
[613.56] Calm down, my child.
[626.92] We're late today.
[629.24] Come on, Umi, let's hurry up.
[632.12] Let's go inside.
[635.16] You know she makes
us sit for two hours.
[638.80] I get tired of
sitting for that long.
[641.16] Come on, get up.
[643.76] Umi.
[668.12] Come on, let's go inside.
[669.96] Take me home,
Shameem, I don't want to be here.
[674.68] It will only take
a couple of minutes...
[676.36] I want to go home.
I don't want to see the doctor.
[679.08] Take me home.
[683.36] Umi...
[685.12] Don't insist,
Shameem, let's go home.
[713.08] Good boy...
[716.08] Good boy...
[720.84] Shameem.
[723.80] Hmm?
[726.20] Do you love me?
[731.40] Hmm.
[732.64] Say it aloud.
[733.84] Do you love me?
[738.20] Why do you ask?
[740.96] I love you a lot.
[746.52] What can you do for me?
[751.24] I won't make any claims.
[760.12] But I love you a lot.
[763.72] Can you kill him for my sake?
[767.20] Umi.
[772.12] What did I say wrong?
[774.72] Is it difficult?
[777.12] Take a closer look,
[779.84] doesn't he look like Bilal.
[781.28] Same eyes, same smile.
[783.40] - Don't you see Bilal in him?
- There's no such thing.
[785.72] No Bilal.
[787.48] He's like him.
[789.68] Kill him.
[791.12] Kill him, Shameem.
[792.96] I can never move
forward if he's around.
[796.28] You want me to love you?
[798.32] Don't you want me to love you?
[800.28] Kill him.
[802.04] - Kill him.
- You've lost your mind!
[804.20] Move.
[807.92] You can't kill him.
[811.28] I will kill him.
[813.36] I am his mother.
[814.32] - I won't let you do anything like that.
- Move aside.
[816.96] - I will strangle him. Out of my way!
- Don't be crazy.
[820.44] Shameem, out of my way.
I will not spare him!
[824.04] Don't be crazy.
[825.08] Why are you interfering?
[826.20] He's my child. I'll decide
whether to keep him or not.
[827.96] Whether I want him or not.
I will strangle him. Leave me.
[831.36] Leave me.
[834.80] - Enough!
- Leave me, Shameem.
[837.12] Leave me.
[839.48] Leave me.
[841.40] Enough!
[844.12] I don't want this child,
Shameem, leave me.
[877.12] Okay, fine.
[879.20] I know you're right, but...
[881.32] We'll lose a good
proposal because of you.
[884.24] I'll talk to them
if I've your approval.
[886.32] Enough. "I'll talk to them."
Stop pushing me.
[890.00] Give me time to think. Calm down.
[893.28] I wanted to discuss
this with you last night,
[895.20] I couldn't control myself.
[896.92] I came straight here after
dropping Fatima at school.
[899.92] Listen to me...
[901.64] Sit down, take a breath.
I am talking to you.
[907.36] Slow down, haste is never good.
[910.04] Let me ask Wajeeha first.
[911.80] Whether she agrees or disagrees
to marry such an old man.
[917.12] Wajeeha and you have
a lot of tantrums, Bay ji.
[920.40] First, you show concern
when there are no proposals,
[922.16] or you start finding faults
with the ones that come.
[924.92] And what's the age difference?
[926.16] He's only 15 years older than her.
[927.64] Even Abdullah and
I are 10 years apart.
[929.88] Abdullah is what worries me.
[932.68] He's Abdullah's cousin,
they might have the same habits.
[936.04] Us and them are poles apart.
[938.24] We belong to different school of thoughts.
[941.48] What if he treats
my daughter the same way?
[982.12] Umi.
[984.72] Umi.
[985.32] A person should be
well versed with reality.
[987.84] Have you seen her nature?
[989.72] She has no face or skills.
[991.48] It would be a miracle
if she gets along with someone.
[994.16] What's wrong with her face?
[996.16] What's wrong with her face?
[997.96] She looks like her father.
[999.56] I vent out your father's anger on her.
[1001.52] I sometimes say some harsh things to her.
[1003.52] Don't you look like
your father a little?
[1006.48] Anyway, she isn't
as beautiful as Umaina,
[1009.20] to find a lover
like brother Shameem.
[1010.88] Umi.
[1012.96] Bay ji, have you seen Umi.
[1014.28] Even Ali is not in his room.
[1015.64] We'll check for Umi later...
[1017.36] Umi.
[1018.48] - Listen to me...
- Umi.
[1021.12] - Listen to me...
- Umi.
[1023.08] She's brought a marriage
proposal for Wajeeha.
[1025.20] What is your opinion?
[1028.56] Bay ji, I am worried about them?
[1030.20] I wonder where they are. Umi.
[1034.28] Look at him, Rukhsana,
[1035.88] he's lost his mind because
of Umaina and her child.
[1041.08] Earlier he was so concerned
about his sisters.
[1043.68] Such love and care for her.
And now it's all for her child.
[1047.72] Umaina is far luckier than us.
[1051.68] Our husbands don't care
whether we live or die.
[1055.72] Anyway, there's no point
in cursing our destiny.
[1060.08] Do I say yes or no?
[1085.12] What is your problem?
[1086.84] I told you she didn't come here.
[1088.04] Stop chasing after me.
[1090.12] Where else could she go if not here?
[1092.84] Shameem,
I don't care if she goes to hell.
[1096.92] Understand.
Move.
[1098.44] Give me a cigarette.
[1100.40] Yes, you're right. You don't care.
[1103.68] She was madly in love with you,
[1105.16] but why would you
care about her condition.
[1107.44] She risked her life for you,
but you wouldn't care.
[1111.72] Listen to me,
[1113.96] save this speech for someone else.
[1118.24] She's responsible
for her own consequences.
[1121.84] I gave her a nice offer.
[1123.92] She did the right thing,
[1125.84] by not accepting
your humiliating offer.
[1129.64] She did the right thing?
[1131.36] By the way, what did you do?
[1135.68] You gave her respect.
[1140.92] And what did she do with it?
[1143.28] She ran away.
[1146.36] Now get lost.
[1148.92] Listen, if anything happens
to her or her child, then...
[1153.44] Then?
[1154.64] Then?
[1157.76] Save whatever little
manliness you have,
[1162.36] for the one who betrayed
you and eloped with someone else!
[1168.40] Understand.
[1169.88] Now get lost.
[1171.24] I'm tired of seeing your face.
[1172.92] Get lost!
[1174.32] Get lost!
[1175.96] Get lost!
[1179.36] He's spoiled my mood.
Give me a cigarette.
[1183.40] Get lost!
[1195.20] Humaira.
[1198.28] Humaira.
[1200.12] Where the hell are you?
[1203.28] Get me my shirt.
[1205.56] The red one.
[1216.40] Humaira.
[1221.68] Humaira.
[1238.12] What are you looking for, Humaira?
Will you tell me?
[1245.44] Did you find it?
[1251.16] Thank God.
Thank God. Thank God. Thank God.
[1254.40] My gold chain.
[1257.12] I can't find my gold chain, Bay ji.
[1259.32] I told you she didn't take anything,
[1263.04] except for her child.
[1264.52] She didn't even take her luggage.
[1266.08] God help her.
[1267.16] She didn't take her belongings,
but she took my gold chain.
[1272.56] This is always the case with me.
[1273.92] - What's wrong with her?
- Someone's always interrupting my wedding.
[1275.68] Oh, God! Did she steal
something from her too?
[1277.88] Listen to me carefully,
[1278.72] if I don't get married
this time I'll jump off the roof.
[1281.40] If anyone creates
hurdles in my marriage,
[1283.36] Calm this witch down, Humaira.
[1284.64] - I will commit suicide.
- I said go calm her down.
[1286.12] When we were flooded with marriage proposals
for her she refused to entertain them,
[1288.20] and now when they stopped coming,
she is creating a scene over it.
[1289.96] Then why did you say no?
[1291.24] You should've accepted the proposal.
[1292.40] Really, Humaira? Why did I say no?
[1295.88] What would we say when they'd ask
where's Umaina and her child?
[1305.16] Hey you ugly face,
don't you dare, you cockeyed...
[1309.28] I am telling you, Humaira,
[1311.12] she won't stop until
she's killed her mother.
[1313.96] She is right, Bay ji.
[1315.96] You should've accepted the proposal.
[1317.52] We could've said that
Umaina is visiting her parents.
[1321.40] Not again.
[1322.88] And what about your brother,
[1325.36] who is wandering
around looking for her?
[1326.84] Who is going to stop him?
[1327.92] Who will call him back?
[1330.28] It's all the child's fault.
[1332.12] They cannot handle him.
[1334.92] The thief even took my gold chain.
[1339.40] She took the key and the chain.
[1342.68] It's all my fault.
[1345.44] I am doomed.
[1347.72] So much has happened
and she is worried about her chain.
[1361.16] Sir, his wife ran away.
[1363.72] That was obvious.
[1365.76] Look at your paunch.
[1367.92] Not mine, sir, his wife ran away.
[1374.16] Wasn't that obvious?
[1376.24] File a report.
[1379.32] How did she elope and with whom?
[1383.16] And did she take anything with her?
[1386.72] No, she did not elope.
[1389.12] She is missing.
[1391.12] She is sick.
[1393.76] She also has a child.
[1398.56] I am talking to you and
you're busy on the phone.
[1400.96] Keep it down.
[1402.68] Calm down.
[1404.48] Don't try to teach us our job.
[1407.16] There's a reason we're on this post.
[1408.76] Leave it, sir. I'll talk to him.
Don't worry, sir, don't worry.
[1413.44] Come with me and file a report.
[1415.12] Please, come with me.
[1427.40] Umi...where were you?
[1431.40] Tell me where were you?
[1434.44] I am asking you a question.
Where were you?
[1436.76] Move back, Shameem.
[1438.92] Where is Ali?
[1442.64] Umi...
[1446.08] Umi, where is Ali?
[1447.68] For God's sake tell me where is Ali.
[1449.64] Where is Ali?
[1451.12] Where is my child?
[1453.76] - Umi...
- Shameem, I am tired.
[1455.92] Okay, fine.
But first, tell me where is Ali.
[1460.12] Tell me.
[1461.40] I said I am tired. Leave me!
[1571.36] They say every path leads somewhere.
[1576.16] But for me,
life ended somewhere on the way.
[1580.84] I was unaware of emotions like love,
care, humanity.
[1592.12] I was completely numb.
[1596.04] Leaving only hatred.
[1600.12] The hatred that I was carrying
in my arms, starving and tired.
[1607.96] I wanted to give punishment,
but to whom?
[1611.96] To me, Bilal, the child, or Shameem?
[1623.12] I didn't know.
[1782.36] Am I looking nice?
[1785.04] How about some tea?
[1787.76] Sit.
[1788.92] You've been awake the entire night.
I'll make some breakfast.
[1806.08] Do you want some breakfast?
[1807.48] Do I make for you too?
[1819.24] What happened?
[1820.96] What is it?
[1832.56] Greetings, Bay ji.
[1833.64] Greetings.
[1835.36] Did you have breakfast?
[1837.16] Er... Yes.
[1841.12] This is for Shameem.
[1847.12] See...
[1848.96] She is behaving as nothing happened.
[1852.64] Ask her about the chain.
[1858.32] Breakfast.
[1860.96] Come on.
[1865.44] I don't want to eat.
[1870.40] I am asking you something. Where is Ali?
[1872.72] Have some breakfast,
I made it especially for you.
[1875.56] Or should I make
something else for you?
[1877.08] I am asking you something.
I want an answer.
[1879.36] Where did you leave him?
[1881.68] Ali who?
[1883.64] Our son.
[1885.16] We haven't had any children yet.
[1887.28] Don't be mad.
Come on, let's have breakfast.
[1890.92] Look Umi, don't test my patience.
[1894.40] - Otherwise-
- Otherwise what?
[1896.36] I said we haven't
had any children yet.
[1899.92] And you can forget all about Ali.
[1906.04] What are you saying?
[1908.68] This is completely unfair.
[1912.04] I'm hungry.
[1913.88] Let's have breakfast.
[1920.12] Fine.
[1922.20] Don't tell me if you don't want to.
[1925.64] I'll find him from wherever he is.
[1930.12] I will find out.
[1953.52] Sir, please...
[1956.04] Please help me.
[1958.56] Do something, please.
[1963.52] Your wife returned on her own,
[1965.44] and you made us run
around the entire city.
[1967.96] She must have hidden him somewhere.
[1971.04] No, she didn't bring
the child back with her.
[1976.12] Maybe she killed the
child and hid the body.
[1979.64] Did she get into any kind of fight,
[1981.68] or an affair?
[1985.32] No, no, I swear that's not the case.
[1990.64] We'll soon find out.
[1993.52] You can't hide it from the Police.
[1996.28] Naveed, do one thing.
[1999.96] Go with him.
[2003.04] Where?
[2004.36] He'll tell you.
[2015.20] Every year we find
several bodies of children,
[2018.52] some in the dumpster,
others under a rock.
[2022.64] Rascals commit the crime,
and punish the child for it.
[2026.64] We found three dead bodies today.
[2029.40] Come take a look,
maybe your child's among them.
[2032.84] We recovered one of
them from a pile of trash.
[2035.88] And the other one...
[2071.80] Did you propose Majid's
name for Wajeeha?
[2075.04] No, not me. It was Hamida.
[2079.56] Couldn't you have told me?
[2081.48] I thought maybe she
already had a word with you.
[2087.44] I am never informed about
anything going on in this house.
[2091.44] You want to ruin what
little family honour I have,
[2093.80] with your family's obnoxious ways.
[2098.04] Wajeeha is a nice girl.
[2099.16] I see...
And what about your sister-in-law?
[2101.68] I heard she left
her child somewhere.
[2104.36] Witch...
[2106.24] How could she not
take mercy on her child?
[2108.80] She did the right thing leaving him.
[2111.16] No one wanted him anyway.
[2113.72] You said I...
[2115.96] Don't make me look so cruel.
[2118.80] What's done was done.
[2120.92] He was a child after all.
She could've shown some mercy.
[2124.28] Anyway, keep my family
away from your family's obnoxious ways.
