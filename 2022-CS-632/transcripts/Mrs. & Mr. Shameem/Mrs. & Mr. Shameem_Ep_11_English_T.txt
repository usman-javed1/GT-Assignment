[94.84] Slow down, please.
What's wrong with you?
[97.40] If I leave this serum
in your hair for too long,
[99.80] then your silky
hair will turn crude.
[102.16] Bravo.  You're done, get out.
[106.32] Asif, you attend to him.
[108.88] Please go with him.
[114.68] Are these fat,
ugly men my only clients now?
[122.28] You can't have
your way around here.
[124.40] Otherwise, I'll throw you out.
[127.96] Why are you so annoyed with me?
[130.52] I wasn't going to bite him.
[134.40] He's such a cute guy.
[136.20] Why are all men blind?
[138.00] And look who's attending to him,
[139.20] that ugly, bald guy.
[143.20] If any client complains about you,
[145.28] I will throw you out.
[146.80] If you weren't good at your job, I
[147.72] would've never employed you.
[152.68] I'm good at other jobs too.
[155.24] Try me.
[159.24] Get lost.
[203.20] Aren't you getting
addicted to smoking?
[208.00] Mom, can I tell you something?
[210.24] Tell me.
[211.44] Let's go on the roof.
[213.60] Why?
[269.36] Tony.
[275.92] What have I done now?
[277.52] Happy birthday to you!
[281.36] Happy birthday to you!
[285.80] Happy birthday, dear Tony!
[289.60] Happy birthday to you!
[343.08] Tired?
[346.72] Yes...
[348.92] Thank you so much.
[352.00] Made me really happy.
[354.76] No one has celebrated my
birthday in all these years.
[358.40] Not even your family?
[364.04] Who accepts an embarrassment?
[367.60] They are dead to me.
[374.52] I had a childhood friend,
[378.04] he was like me.
[380.52] But these girls are a bi***
[387.00] They have no integrity.
[389.04] She swapped my guy
from under my nose.
[392.92] Bi***
[395.92] Since that day,
[397.60] I lost faith in love
and friendship.
[407.56] But why?
[410.60] This is not by choice.
[413.40] Ask yourself.
[414.88] Do you like this by choice?
[429.12] My uncle had a friend.
[432.16] He used to love me a lot.
[435.92] He would bring chocolates,
toys, toffees, everything.
[442.84] Every day.
[448.08] One day he took me home.
[452.12] To show me a new toy.
[459.20] He took me inside
the room and locked it.
[468.12] I cried inconsolably.
[471.40] I didn't know what was happening.
[478.72] Later I complained about him.
Told them everything.
[486.56] Instead, I was...
[492.36] Well...
[497.28] Later I grew used to it.
[500.40] Now it's a part of me.
[507.04] What is this?
[513.56] Shameem, I told you my
love story as a rape story,
[518.52] and you got emotional.
[522.84] "Now it's a part of me."
[546.68] You get emotional so quickly.
[552.76] I shared my story with you because,
[556.48] you're like me.
[559.16] Although I know you detest me.
[567.92] But I like you.
[573.72] Can I say something?
[582.80] Will you be my friend?
[592.76] What are you doing, Fatima?
[594.24] Why are you doing it?
[597.68] I know I'm wrong,
[599.44] but I want to do something wrong.
[600.92] When you know it's wrong then why?
[605.32] If you love that guy,
Fatima, then tell me, -
[607.72] I'll talk to your family.
- Love?
[609.68] That bloody hoodlum?
[611.44] So what is all this?
[612.60] I'm just being cheap.
[618.88] Are you angry with someone?
[621.28] Furious?
[623.56] Talk to me, Fatima.
[624.72] Tell me whatever is on your mind.
[625.68] I want to help you out.
[627.24] - Please.
- You couldn't even help yourself,
[629.60] how can you help me?
[631.84] And anyway,
I don't need anyone's help,
[633.36] to destroy my life.
[634.92] Why do you want to destroy yourself?
[638.36] Is it something sister-in-law
Rukhsana said?
[642.16] Brother Abdullah?
[651.72] He's your father.  I
[654.60] know he's got a temper, but
he only wants good things for you.
[658.76] If you're trying to rebel
against him, then don't.
[662.72] Even you rebelled against everyone.
[668.00] Then why shouldn't I?
[670.92] Fatima had sworn to doom herself,
only to rebel against brother Abdullah.
[676.84] On the other hand, Wajeeha,
[679.28] who was suffering from an inferiority
complex, was slowly losing her mind.
[685.24] I'm crazy about you, Wajeeha.
[688.68] You are my life.
[691.84] Liar.
[693.28] You are such a flirt.
[695.84] The truth, I swear, Wajeeha.
[701.24] Without you, I'll be dead.
[705.16] You're lying, aren't you?
[707.24] Just like you lied
to me the other day.
[710.32] No, Wajeeha, see.
[714.12] Your eyes,
your hair, your nose are so cute.
[725.36] You're lying again.
[728.32] You don't like me at all.
[737.36] Greetings.
[738.72] Greetings, sir.
[741.40] How are you?
[742.20] I am good.
How are you?
[743.44] I am great.
[744.76] So tell me?
[745.84] I want to style my hair.
[746.88] And?
[747.76] And a massage as well.
[749.24] Okay.
[754.16] Give me five minutes.
[756.20] Tony will attend to
you as soon as he's free.
[760.72] Tony.
[772.84] Stupid.
[775.44] Thank you very much.
[783.40] Shameem's friendship with
Tony was getting deeper every day.
[788.12] He would now come over
to our house every day.
[791.88] Whenever he would come over.
[793.96] He would take over the entire house,
kitchen, and family members.
[799.12] Just like in the Hindi movies...
[800.36] ...I will curse you.
[803.12] Why did you go to the temple alone?
[805.12] Let my son come home,
he will teach you a lesson.
[813.00] Enjoy your meal.
[816.20] I had no friend before him,
[823.16] except for Umaina.
[826.68] No, not today.
[828.04] But now, she was my wife.
[832.76] And I needed a friend like him.
[840.80] Someone who was almost like me.
[849.84] Even Tony was yearning for familial love,
[857.96] which he found in my family.
[865.60] Just kidding.
[915.40] You have a big heart.
[918.16] Hats off to you, Umaina.
[925.76] You should share some tips
with Humaira as well.  Hmm?
[951.04] You're such a glutton.
[959.44] Right there.  Yes.
[992.12] At least close the door,
don't spoil my appetite.
[1000.80] Go die somewhere else.
[1007.84] Stop it.
Even my food stinks of puke now.
[1017.28] Listen...
[1021.88] Take me to the doctor.
[1026.68] I think I am...
[1034.76] What do you think?
[1036.76] I think...
[1049.32] How dare you?
[1052.80] How dare you?
[1054.32] What nonsense are you talking about?
[1056.36] Whose child is this?
[1058.16] How can you get pregnant?
[1059.36] Why are you abusing me?
[1061.20] You kept abusing me when
I couldn't get pregnant,
[1063.72] and even when I am pregnant.
[1065.20] Why?
[1066.12] - Why can't I get pregnant?
- Who have you been sleeping with?
[1069.40] This is not my child.
[1070.88] Stop accusing me!
[1072.84] Since I am your wife,
this is your child.
[1074.72] He's not!  He cannot be my child.
[1077.16] Who have you been sleeping with?
[1078.84] Otherwise, I will tell everyone.  It
[1081.36] doesn't matter where
I got it from.
[1084.84] You wanted a child.  Here it is.
[1087.28] What is the problem now?
[1088.44] I will not raise him.
I will not accept him.
[1091.04] Why won't you accept him?
[1092.48] I am your wife.
[1093.36] What reason will you
give that he's not your child?
[1095.48] Because he cannot be my child.
[1097.20] Why not?
[1098.44] That Reshma, that sweeper,
and that woman from LG Road,
[1101.68] when I couldn't get her pregnant,
how can you...
[1121.84] You're laughing.
[1123.76] Humaira, have you lost your mind?
[1126.48] I'll slap you.
[1138.08] Bloody impotent!
[1156.08] I didn't tell anyone about
Fatima even though I wanted to.
[1162.08] But how long could it stay a secret?
[1164.52] One day brother Abdullah found out.
[1167.68] Hit me!  Hit me!
[1169.20] Skin me alive for all I care!
[1171.72] You don't need to take the trouble.
[1173.36] This...
This is how one's skinned alive.
[1176.16] Take a look.  Take a look.
[1178.16] Why didn't I die before seeing this?
[1180.76] Why didn't you die,
you shameless man?
[1182.92] What are you doing?
[1184.84] Where did you learn
to speak like this?
[1186.24] Who else but that Umaina?
[1188.08] I told you a dozen times not to take my
daughter among those shameless people.
[1192.88] I only wanted the best for her.
[1194.20] - I made her a religious scholar.
- A religious scholar, huh?
[1196.76] Where were you when I used to cry,
[1198.84] and scream not to send
me to those monsters!
[1201.56] Who are you talking about?
[1202.52] Who are you talking about?
[1203.72] The same man whose hands you kiss?
[1207.72] Those same hands dishonoured me!
[1210.88] From here, and here.
[1213.72] For God's sake, stop it!
[1216.16] Shameless, if you have no shame,
[1218.48] at least don't spoil
someone else's reputation.
[1220.76] What honor, father?
[1224.52] I don't have any honor left.
[1227.20] You have a good sense of humor.
[1229.52] Don't you dare!
[1232.36] Don't you dare touch my daughter!
[1252.80] I think that
[1254.08] at least talk to Tony once.
[1256.40] But how is this possible, Bay ji?
[1258.52] What do you mean how is it possible?
[1260.80] Wajeeha has all the
qualities of a wife.
[1264.04] Apart from everything
else he's always coming over,
[1267.88] he's your friend.
[1269.24] Why can't you talk to him?
[1271.88] But Bay ji, Tony is...
[1274.16] What?
[1277.08] I know.
[1279.80] Aren't you?
[1284.04] Come on.
[1286.52] You keep Umaina so happy.
[1290.04] Shower so much love.
[1291.72] He's your friend.
[1294.44] What if he treats
Wajeeha the same way?
[1296.32] With love and care.
[1298.68] At least take a chance.
[1301.08] You're being impossible now.
[1303.72] Umaina, he always listens to you.
[1309.72] Wajeeha likes Tony.
[1327.92] Tony...
[1330.20] I am gay, I swear.
[1335.12] Like gay.
[1336.60] Like, I can't be a lesbian.
[1344.08] I can't...
[1350.36] Humaira.
[1352.28] Humaira.
[1358.76] Who is it?
[1359.68] Who is that ba****
[1361.56] For God's sake, Humaira, tell
me whose child this is?
[1369.72] What happened?
[1374.20] Are you feeling jealous?
[1378.32] Why?
[1380.72] I've been enduring
your affairs for so long.
[1385.12] And you can't endure
a little philandering-
[1387.60] You call this little!
I'll punch you in the...
[1396.88] If this is really so unimportant,
[1398.96] then why don't you tell me?
[1401.44] Tell me.
[1403.40] - Do you want to know?
- Yes.
[1407.76] Okay, fine.  I'll be honest with you.
[1413.36] I am...not pregnant.
[1424.52] What nonsense is this?
[1426.84] Are you really not pregnant?
[1429.52] Then why were you humiliating me?
[1432.20] I'll slap you, [ __ ].
[1437.04] No more abuses.
[1440.40] I won't endure any more abuses.
[1444.76] This could have been done
more respectfully.
[1450.60] But I am done giving you respect.
[1453.16] You couldn't digest it.
[1458.48] You considered my fidelity
as my weakness and exploited me.
[1464.32] But not anymore.
[1467.28] The secret is out now.
[1472.20] I won't take any more insults.
[1475.32] And you know what I am capable of.
[1479.24] What can you do?
[1484.40] You men can only threaten us.
[1489.28] You're crossing your limit...
[1492.08] Are you threatening me, hmm?
[1496.76] The day I decide to humiliate you,
[1500.20] I'll strip you naked in public.
[1503.44] I'll tell everyone.
[1508.04] By the way, I am a woman.
[1512.40] Even if I don't bear
a child I'll still be a woman.
[1519.08] But you're a man.
[1523.24] Imagine what will
happen to your pride.
[1527.24] Did you ever give it a thought?
[1529.88] What will it make you?
[1536.76] From a virile man to being unmanly.
[1541.40] Useless man!
[1559.28] How far should we walk?
[1560.84] Don't I look cute already.
[1563.08] If I lose any more weight,
the entire city will go crazy for me.
[1568.16] For God's sake,
Tony, stop your whining.
[1573.44] Shameem.
[1575.92] These things are
necessary for good health.
[1579.28] For God's sake, Tony, why are you
always having such vile thoughts?
[1584.16] He's such a cute guy, Shameem.
[1588.80] Forget him,
he looks so dirty and old.
[1592.28] - Come on.
- He doesn't look old at all.
[1594.28] And I like dirty boys.
[1596.20] I will get his number today.
[1599.72] For God's sake, why do
you always behave like a wh*** Tony
[1603.52] , please be decent
when I'm around.
[1607.96] - Come on.
- Be descent you say.
[1609.60] Like being decent would
fetch me any medals.
[1613.20] This is how you
get the number, watch.
[1616.32] What are you doing?
[1629.20] Come on.
[1637.76] What has happened, Lord?
[1641.60] What happened?
[1644.60] I always wanted the
best for my daughter.
[1650.36] I always wanted my daughter to be...
[1655.60] To be my stairway to heaven.
[1660.12] This is not what I
had imagined for her, Lord.
[1670.16] Lord...please show her the right path.
[1674.44] Please show her the right path.
[1677.96] And save me from this humiliation.
[1681.20] Lord...please save me
from this humiliation.
[1690.32] You know I cannot be blamed
for what happened to my daughter.
[1699.24] Lord, please...
[1704.72] O Lord, save my daughter.
[1714.40] Your greed for heaven
turned our lives into hell.
[1721.52] Will you be accepted in heaven now?
[1726.60] Never!
[1731.36] Forgive me, Lord.
[1734.60] Forgive me!
[1773.76] Why did you bring me
to this isolated place?
[1776.20] Couldn't you find
someplace brighter?
[1778.12] What's on your mind?
[1779.32] What fantasies?
[1780.56] Come on, tell me.
[1784.52] I want to kill you, rascal!
[1788.32] But I am giving you one more chance.
[1789.76] Mend your ways.
Or I'll have you gang raped.
[1794.84] Come on.  Let's go.
[1850.28] At least tell us how this happened?
Who beat you up?
[1854.72] I kept telling him to mend his ways.
[1859.04] - But he never listens.
- Calm down.
[1860.76] Are you happy now?
[1861.80] Isn't this what you wanted?
[1863.36] Look at your condition now.
[1864.72] They almost beat you to death.
[1866.44] What else could I do?
[1868.72] I was helpless.
[1871.72] Those scoundrels beat me up,
[1874.48] and also took my money.
[1877.40] They even took my silver chain...
[1880.88] I recently bought a Chinese phone.
[1885.92] Rascals took that too.
[1889.56] Let's go to the Police
Station and file a report.
[1894.16] No use.  They too will beat me up.
[1900.84] What will I tell them?
[1902.72] What was I doing there?
[1907.12] They don't treat
us like human beings.
[1910.84] We're worse than insects
in their view.
[1918.08] Even mangy curs have
more respect than us.
[1920.68] Get rid of these thoughts.
[1923.72] Come on.
[1925.36] God bless you.
[1929.72] Stop it.  Stop it.
[1933.48] Don't worry,
everything will be fine.
[1939.76] Don't worry, I'll...
[1965.88] What's wrong with Tony?
[1971.48] You can share with me.
[1978.12] I know Tony needs you,
and you need him.
[1985.40] And if there's anything
between you two-
[1988.60] Have you lost your mind!
[1991.36] Who do you think I am?
[1994.16] Don't be furious.
[1997.12] How could you even
imagine such a thing?
[2000.24] - Sorry.
- I accept he's my friend,
[2001.56] but that doesn't mean... I
[2004.56] am sorry, Shameem.  I am sorry.
[2006.76] - I'll throw him out of the house tomorrow.
- No, no,
[2008.72] I won't have any
relationship with him ever.
[2010.16] Okay, I shouldn't
have said such a thing.
[2012.68] It's my fault.  I'm sorry,
[2015.36] I didn't mean to hurt you.
[2017.32] Don't be angry.
[2018.20] I'm just concerned
that you look worried.
[2024.00] I am sorry.
[2026.00] Don't spoil your mood.
[2041.16] What happened?
[2044.68] These Titu company
blades that you purchase,
[2047.52] are already getting
a lot of complaints.
[2052.72] God, steam isn't going to help.
[2055.48] You own such a big salon,
[2057.44] and look how dirty your face is.
[2059.20] I like even dirty.
[2060.84] Let me shape you up a little.
[2062.60] I feel very irritated.
[2063.52] What are you doing?
For my sake, please.
[2065.52] - I don't need it.
- It's overgrown.
[2066.84] - It's looking very dirty.
- I'm telling you...
[2068.52] I'm just making it look neater.
[2070.84] What are you doing?
[2071.88] Why are you moving?
[2074.60] I am bleeding now.
[2075.80] Don't use a towel,
it will get septic.
[2078.20] Hold on.
[2078.92] Stop it.
[2079.88] Move your hand.
[2081.04] I told you Ali likes it this way.
[2084.56] No, no wait.
[2086.72] Leave it.  Just leave me like this.
[2091.84] - Keep your hand over here.
- Leave it.
[2095.00] I am sorry.
[2097.40] I'm telling you
Ali likes it this way.
[2100.00] I am sorry.
[2100.92] I don't want to be neat.
[2102.48] Tony wasn't keeping well those days.
[2109.48] He had to be taken
to the hospital frequently.
[2116.40] He stopped coming to the salon.
[2121.16] I tried to contact him, but,
[2127.56] he disappeared without a trace.
[2165.24] Fatima!
[2175.96] How is Fatima?
[2176.76] Fatima?  Where is Fatima?
[2178.32] Shameem, please save my child,
[2180.56] this man will kill her.
[2182.76] Stop it.
[2184.36] If anything happens to my child,
[2186.28] I will not spare you.
[2187.44] This is not the place
to say such things.

[2218.20] Our entire family
has the same blood group.
[2220.68] You're right,
but please try to understand.
[2225.00] I don't understand.
[2229.08] I am really sorry to tell you,
