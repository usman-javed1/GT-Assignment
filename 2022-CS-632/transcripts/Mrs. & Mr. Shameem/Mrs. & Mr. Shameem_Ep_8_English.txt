Forgive me. Get up! What's wrong? Where is my chain? What chain, madwoman? Go and sleep. Where is my gold chain? I don't know. Are you accusing me of stealing,
madwoman? Go ask your sister-in-law. Would I rather ask your
lover to whom you gave the chain? Shame on me for doubting Umaina. The real thief is lying next to me. You've lost your mind. These strange prayers
have polluted your mind. Yes, I've lost my mind. I've lost my mind begging,
pleading, praying for a child! You enjoy covering your body
with feculence and grubbiness. Your mind is filled with dirt.  That's
the reason my prayers don't get answered. Enough. I won't tolerate it anymore. You're the unfortunate one
who carries this sad face around. I alone tolerate you. You tolerate me? I am unfortunate. I see... What did you see in that maid? She must be smelling atrocious. She didn't disgust you? You didn't feel disgusted? No, I don't. I like her.
She's much better compared to you. The fragrance of a complete woman! I'm having an affair with her.
I gave the chain to her. Let's see what you can do. Humaira... Humaira? What's the matter? Nothing, Bay ji. Go back to rest. Right. With you standing over
my head in the night? Do you need more money? No. Take it from my cupboard. Leave some for me. Even you think I'm a beggar, Bay ji.
I don't want your money. What's the matter?  What happened? Bay ji. Don't you pray for me? Perfect. This is something new.  Time to get up. You have come up with
something new this time. If the mother doesn't pray
for her child then who will. What's the matter? Maybe you don't mean it. He never listens to me. He only listens to mothers. Maybe he'll listen to you. God didn't bless me
with the opportunity to become a mother. How can I believe that
prayers are answered? Listen, Humaira, prayers are always answered. If the devotee's faith isn't strong, then you don't blame God. Is my faith weak? Mine, Bay ji? I see... And Umaina has a
gold medal in integrity. Okay, fine.  Stop it now. For God's sake, I am begging you. Don't be hasty. Your hastiness ruins
all the good that you do. He blesses everyone. Everyone. But we humans are thankless. We complain when our
prayers are answered. and also when they are not. The one you're jealous of, has nothing. Nothing at all. Nature is unfair, Bay ji. It doesn't bless the
one who's pining for it. But blessed is the one who
didn't want it in the first place. Seek forgiveness, Humaira. You should never
question God's will. Why not, Bay ji?
Why shouldn't I complain? Is it my fault that
I can't bear a child? Why should I be punished
for nature's mistake, Bay ji? Bay ji. Yes. Tell Shammo... ...to give the child to me. I will raise him. Let's sit on the swing. Let's sit on the swing. Come on.
Bless you, son. Good boy. Bless you. Let's swing.  Good boy. Go make tea. Swing. Swing. Ali likes to swing. Ali likes to swing. - Bless you.  Bless you.
- Shammo. Bless you. Yes, Bay ji. Yes, my dear. You're playing with
the child all day, what about your business? Come on, Bay ji,
we've got workers at the shop. Isn't it?  Isn't it? Isn't it? Leaving your business
in the hands of workers. Didn't Abdullah catch
the workers skimming? And you're letting them
handle the entire business. Bay ji, one needs to trust people. The boys are very nice.
They are very good. I know they are nice,
they can handle everything. And why are you doing a woman's job? Let her take care of him. And if your wife can't raise her, then give him to Humaira. She will take care of him. Bay ji, why trouble anyone? Isn't it, Ali? - It's not about the-
- I've made a point. We don't bother anyone. We don't bother anyone. Stop it.  Let's play.  Let's play. Ali, my boy. Let's play. Well, you don't even
know your sister brought tea. Ali... Come on. Bay ji, where is Ali? I don't know. And since when did
you worry about Ali? He was crying in the room, did anyone take him? Who will take him?
He can't run away on his own. And listen, have you done something? For God's sake Bay ji,
what are you saying? No, Shammo,
I saw it with my own eyes. I could never muster the
courage before, to witness this. What other evidence do
you want of her love? You've got evidence, don't you? - I've had enough.
- Shammo, listen... - Humaira, give him back.
- No, please. Give Ali back. Give Ali back to me.
Don't be crazy. - I won't give him back.
- Listen.  Why don't you understand? Bay ji. Bay ji, how can you give
someone's child to another person. Then go ask her if
she wants the child. She doesn't. And look at her. This child makes your sister happy, so why don't you give
her this child. Why don't you be
the bigger person here? - She can be a mother too.
- But Bay ji. Bay ji is right. Bay ji is right. How can I... - Umi!
- Stop.  Stop it. - Please.
- Umi! It's okay, it's okay. Don't cry. Those who don't have a house, live in rented homes. And those who can't bear children, become nannies to other children. Stupid woman. You should become a midwife. Help with childbirth for money. Maybe then you'll be at peace. Useless woman!  Barren woman! Humaira... Where are you taking
the child at this hour? I'm taking Ali to the shrine, to get him purged. Then take Shammo along. No, no, he'll be a nuisance. I'll take him myself. Goodbye. Come out. Will you leave quietly
or take a beating? Come out. Come out. Come out. Didn't you hear me? Come out. Shush. You're here. Did you bring the child? Yes. The ritual will
start on Friday night. Are you ready? Man is unique in his own way. He has so many faces and masks, that he fails to recognize
his own identity. I am asking you again. Are you ready for this ritual? Humaira wasn't bad
just like the rest of us. We aren't good or bad. Desires,
wishes, unfulfilled happiness, make us do good or bad deeds. But during the process, we don't realize that... ...we're actually falling into a pit. There was me, who wasn't ready to accept my child. And then there was Humaira, who wanted to become a
mother at any cost! Even if she had to
pay any price for it. Disappointment had
completely engulfed her. She was doing it to get the tag
of a barren woman off herself. Humaira. Humaira. What is it? What is it? What's the matter? Are you hungry? Hold still. Your hand is stuck. Wait a second.  Settle down. Humaira, what happened
to his wrist? I don't know, Bay ji. - Maybe it got twisted.
- Twisted? It's completely blue. Look at the color. This looks bad. Are you not taking care of him? I do, Bay ji,
I take good care of him. Don't embarrass
me in front of Shammo. Never, Bay ji. I'll give him a bath. The water is warm now. Ali. What happened, Umi? What happened? Humaira... Humaira what? Nothing. Here. I am fine. Everything else is fine, Rukhi, but, But what? My heart is restless. When a person does a good deed, Shameem must accept it. Imagine how happy
Humaira is with Ali. I don't know why, she never brings him in front of me. She always tries to
keep him away from my sight. She's afraid you
might take him back. You should be happy that
Ali's still in the same house. Amidst family. You're right. But Umi is very restless. She doesn't tell me. This distance from
Ali has been bothering her. She kept him away when he was around, and now she wakes up in
the middle of the night restless. After all, she is a mother. Mother. Tea. - Greetings, Bay ji.
- Greetings. My princess looks so cute. Look at her, Shammo,
she's looking so beautiful. You must be tired. Yes, Bay ji, you know how
these international flights are. - I am dead beat.
- Salma. How are you? Leave her. Did you get my make-up kit? Silly girl,
let her settle down first. "Did you get my make-up kit?" Leave her, come and rest. Did you get everything I told you to? - Yes, I got everything.
- Come on. Come on. What are you doing with my brother? What are you tormenting him for? The guy who betrayed you
is leading a comfortable life. Bilal had a son. He's posting pictures on Facebook. Your situation didn't matter to him. My brother's life was ruined. I am talking to you. Say something. The tea is getting cold.  Finish it. Ms.  Nanny... Ms.  International Nanny. What's the matter? Why are you always lost in thought? Nothing. What nothing? I used to always find you
praying or pleading, but now... I wonder what goes on in that
mind of yours now? Tell me. I said nothing. You're saying nothing, but a lot is going
on in that mind of yours. Someone has occupied your mind. Well, do you have some money? I need it. I don't have it. Not to spend on that maid. Why?  Don't they pay
you to be his nanny? Are you working for free? Good for nothing. My bad luck. What?  Can I come inside? What are you saying? Her husband's here. Shammo. Shammo. What's the matter?
Why are you making a racket? Racket? There's a storm raging
inside me today. I can't believe my eyes. I have a bad reputation. But this house is
full of sinners. What are you trying to say?
Come to the point. Tell me how much you love your son? And how much can you
pay me to save his life? Are you talking about Ali? Hurry up, we're running out of time. Something will happen. Humaira! Why don't you die!  You've embarrassed me. Damn you!  Why don't you die!
You'll go to hell for it. Bay ji. Children whose parents
don't accept him, face similar consequences. If anyone lays a finger on him,
I will gouge his eyes out. I can raise him alone. I don't need anyone. I can raise him and I will prove it. Alone. Damn you!  Damn you!  Why don't you die! Why don't you die? Why don't you die? How does it feel to be
on the receiving end, huh? When everyone's looking down at you,
cursing you, slapping you? Don't give me money. I am a scoundrel after all, right? Hey. What are you doing? What are you, Shameem? And I am so crazy. The things I've done to you, to myself, the child. Whose sins am I punishing him for? And yet... You still... Forgive me.
