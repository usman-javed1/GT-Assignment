Life was running away from me, and I was roaming around
like a straw in the wind, with my death warrant. The faces of my kin were
revolving in front of my eyes. Bay ji. Ali. Umi. Time's my witness, I never showed haste
in living my life, but now time was slipping
through my fingers. Rukshana, please don't cry. You'll be fine. You'll fall sick.
I am worried about you. With God's grace,
Fatima will be fine. I'll visit tomorrow morning. Do I make her something to eat? Calm down first. Take care. Goodbye. Shameem? Where were you? Where did you disappear to? I was just... I couldn't see Fatima's condition. Allah will bless
Fatima with His grace. Sister-in-law Rukshana's
condition is worse than Fatima. She can't stop crying.
I was just talking to her. I was wondering how difficult it is, for parents to see their
children in this condition. I went to the hospital
only for a while, and I was already worried about Ali. Then I thought, Ali will be fine as
long as you're around. Did you eat? I know you haven't. I'll go get it. Shameem, eat your dinner. Ali is a grown-up now, Umi. He should sleep alone now. I've been saying
that for a long time, but you love him so
much you don't let him go. He might adjust without you,
but can you? There's less space on the bed now. The bed's quite adequate, but maybe you feel that
way because your dear son, sleeps on your side. You can sleep on my side,
and I'll sleep in your place. No. I'll go fetch a mattress, tomorrow I'll get
him a separate bed. Here you go. Enough. - Have a sip.
- I said I've enough. Why do I get all the
stubborn people in the world? I feel pity for you, mom. You're stuck in all this. On one side is that temperamental god
and on the other is me. A disobedient daughter. Your life is finished. When you've a clue
about my problems. then why don't you
make things easier for me? Tell me what to do? Forgive your temperamental god No! Whether you forgive him or not, but for God's sake
don't ruin your life. I've already lived mine, but you've a long way to go. Look at him. I don't like his face. He should stop acting. Curse him. Hey, leave it. Bay ji, why are you eating
so many sweet biscuits? Don't you know what the doctor said? Doctors are crazy. They don't know what
to do or what not to do. It will be the grace
of God if I die like this. Listen to me. God has already decided
everyone's life. Not a minute before
or a minute after. You die when you are supposed to die. If you're destined to stay,
you'll stay, if you're destined to go, you'll go. But with all their
desires fulfilled. See...
Isn't it. - Stop. Leave it.
- No... You've had enough.
Leave it. Get rid of it. Fine. I can't even eat anything
I like when you're around. You'll make me starve to death. You can eat all you
like when I'm not around. How can you say that? Stop scaring me. Stupid man. What happened? Don't be like this. Come here. I am coming. What's the matter? Tell me, son. Listen to me. Don't be like this. Come here. Come, give me a hug. Don't be like this. Don't make me cry. Tell me what's wrong. God bless you, son.
What's the matter? Get rid of these biscuits. I will never eat them again. Same reports. Doesn't matter how many
times you get your reports done, the reports won't change. Do you enjoy seeing people in pain? You could've said that they've
made a mistake again, Shameem. This is not possible. I don't want to give you false
hopes and be careless with you. The sooner you
understand the better. Shameem, delay won't get
you anything but more harm. What have I done? I've never done anything wrong. Are you married? Yes. Any other sexual relationships? God's sake no. Children? I've a son. Shameem, I suggest that you take your
wife and son for an HIV tests as well. They are at high risk. What could I have told her? Why am I getting these tests done? Whereas even I didn't
know how I got it. And if she got it from me... It was a lot easier... ...to not let her know, that I... When a person is facing death, their first reaction is denial. He staggers on the thin
line between hope and denial, like a child on a swing. Now that I think about
it I feel very sad. The pain that Shameem was facing, alone. He was unable to tell anyone. His pain, his fear, he was unable to share with anyone. Not even with me. I was unaware but I could feel, that something between
us is changing drastically. I don't want to sleep.
I don't want to sleep. I want to sleep with papa. Sweetheart,
try sleeping alone for a change. You'll like it.
Come here. I want to sleep with papa.
What is your problem? Now you're misbehaving,
I will slap you. It's getting late,
you've school tomorrow. - Now sleep.
- Stop it. Don't scold him. He is not sleeping. He'll sleep. Give me a hug, papa.
Please, please, please, papa. Enough! It's not nice to be
stubborn all the time! You're a grownup now.
Learn to behave like one. I cannot be with you all the time. Now go sleep on your bed. Tony. Where were you all this time? And what happened? What happened, Tony? Tell me. I'll tell you everything later. For God's sake hide me. Hide you where? What happened? Tell me something. I'll tell you everything,
but for God's sake please hide me. What happened? Tell me something. Those people will kill me. Who? Who? Tony. Tony. Tell me something.
Tony. Tony. What's the matter? Open the door. There's no one here. Open the door otherwise,
I'll break it. There's no one here. Go away. Open the door or else... Break the door. Open the door or else... Fine, I'm opening the door. - Open it.
- Okay. Where is Tony? He came this way. - There is no Tony here.
- Bring him out. I said there's no Tony here. - He's a thief.
- There is no Tony here. I said he's a thief. That's not possible. I see. That means he's inside. - No...
- Tony. - Where do you think you're going?
- Tony! This is my property.
I'll call the Police. Get out. - Are you threatening me?
- Yes, I am. Asshole, how dare you threaten me? Wait, I'll show you. What are you doing? I'll cut you to pieces
with this razor. Leave him! Leave him! He's got nothing
to do with this matter! Why are you dragging
him in all this, brother? Brother. You're not my brother. Where is mother's jewellery? I won't give it back. I am your brother! - Don't call me your brother!
- She was my mother too. Rascal, scoundrel,
I've no relationship with you. Can any of you? Can any of you call
him your flesh and blood! See... No one wants to have
any relationship with you. You're bad blood!
You've a bad reputation! You're bad. You're bad. I am bad blood, ain't I? Yes. - I am bad blood, ain't I?
- Yes! Tony! Here... Is this your family blood? Take it. Take every drop out of my body. Have you lost your mind, Tony? Yes, I've lost my mind. Tony... Here. Here.
This is the bad AIDS blood. Take it. I'm dying anyway,
you take it too. - He's lost his mind.
- Touch it. Where are you going, rascals? Are you alright? What... How are you? I am alright Thank God. I thought I'll ask
about your condition. Are you feeling better now? I am better now. Umaina. You've been very
cruel all your life. Me? I never considered
a good soul all my life. Or consider you
a part of the family. And you had no history
for which I could applaud you. I only followed Allah's orders. What did I do wrong? Brother Abdullah,
it's your own point of view. I don't call you bad. But I won't believe that
Allah hates his thankless devotees. Because if he did then
I would've never found Shameem. What do you want? Do want Fatima to find
someone like Shameem? You have ruined my
entire life's effort. I know my daughter hates me, and I don't care. But she's distancing herself
from Allah because of this hatred. She considers you her idol. Please talk to her. Her father only wants
good things for her. But I know you won't talk to her. You've been cursed
by Humaira herself. You know what, you need to collect
blesses and not curses. When I left home, my mother kissed my forehead. There was regret in her eyes. All her life she couldn't
do anything for me. And finally, she gave
me her entire life's earning, her jewellery. You keep it. This will pay for your losses. You cannot pay for my losses. This loss cannot
be repaid in this life. You've ruined my life. You put an end to everything. Can you return my life to me? Tell me. You've nothing to say. You couldn't even make
peace with your own family. This thought is driving me crazy, what have I done? What was my mistake? What have I done? And whenever I think of a reason, I can only think of you. What are you saying, Shameem? What have I done? I have AIDS. AIDS. Because of you. I'm paying for your doing. My life is ruined. This is how you repaid
my love and emotions. It's all over for me now. You too? Don't laugh, scoundrel. It was nice to hear you abuse. But what to do? It's pretty funny. Oh, Lord. I deserved it. I was your criminal. I deserved it. But what was this
decent man's fault? What happened?
You didn't go to the salon today? What's the matter?
Why are you so quiet? This... It's a love bite. Love bite? I am joking. It's a mosquito. The place is infested
with mosquitoes. They keep biting the entire night. I noticed some on
Ali's arms as well. He had several marks. I think I'll have to go myself. I'll go and get the spray. You know what, get Ali ready, I've to take him to the hospital. - Hospital for a mosquito bite...
- Just do as I said. Don't ask questions. What's the matter? Why are
you so sensitive about Ali's case? I'll apply a cream, he'll be fine. Okay, fine. Don't get angry. I'll get him ready. Let me finish this work first. Shall we? Shameem? Shall we go inside? No, let it be. What do you mean let it be? You insisted on coming here
and not you don't want to go inside. Leave it. I'm sure it's nothing. It's nothing. I'm sure it's nothing. What do you mean it's nothing? You think he's got dengue.? Now that we're here
let's get tested. No, leave it. It was a surprise. Yeah, papa. What's the surprise? I love surprises. We haven't gone out for so long. So I thought why don't
we go for a long ride. If I had told your mom this at home, she would've brought
Bay ji and Wajeeha along. Right Ali? Isn't it. Yeah, mom is so boring. Let's go to some Play Area. Leave me. Sit back properly. Shameem. Don't keep hugging me all the time. Wear your seatbelt. Wear it. It happened several times. My feet would often freeze
on the way to the hospital. I hadn't recovered
from the shock completely. I didn't have the
strength to hear... ...something similar
about Umaina and Ali. I wanted to live that
moment to the fullest. This beautiful universe... ...which I built brick by brick. Even though like a fantasy, but I wanted to keep
it alive as long as I could. I wanted to keep it alive. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! Grandma, do you know
where we went today? - Yes? No, I don't know. And how much fun we had. I even bought this. Great. Now go to your room
and have more fun. These things are not for us. All we get is disappointment. Me and Wajeeha both. You guys have all the fun. - Visit the zoo...
- Bay ji. For God's sake at least don't
say such things in front of the kid. Why? Why not? Are you worried at all? Are you worried about me? Your sister's been crying all day, but you're busy sightseeing. Take them here, there, everywhere. I told you that give
some thought to her too, but no one cares. No one does. And that Tony... Listen to me carefully. Where is that Tony? He ran away too. Maybe he got married too. You do nothing.
I'm telling you, I won't die with this pain. Why do talk about dying? What else should I do?
What else should I do? I feel dead inside already. How do I explain to you? You've forgotten all about
your mother, and your sister. I cannot bear her sorrows anymore. I look hale and hearty to everyone. But no. - I am dead on the inside.
- Don't say that, Bay ji. Don't say such things. Forgive me. Maybe I couldn't be your good son, but I don't mean to make you sad. Forgive me. No, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I was just casually saying it. It's okay. Okay? I took on the responsibility
to find a groom for Wajeeha. Although I never made any
right choices for myself in life. So I was scared. But with God's grace, we found a good
proposal for Wajeeha. And the wedding was fixed. By God, she's so gorgeous. Bring your right hand forth, son. Now she's our daughter. Congratulations. From that moment I began
to understand Shameem's problem. But I was assured that
things were going right. But I was worried. Something bad is going to happen. I tried to forget, but brother Abdullah's
comment about the curse, was etched on my mind. Look at this shawl. - It's beautiful.
- It's nice. It will look really nice with that. It will. And this? This will look nice,
occasionally, Right? - for dinner, or maybe somewhere outside.
- They had another colour in this. You like all the colours. Show us the mustard
colour that you had. Take a look at this. Show me properly. Look at the work done around the neck. Do you have more
colours for this? But I don't like this work... I liked the work done around the neck. - This will go well with it.
- Yes, it will. Sister Umaina. Who are you? I am Marooq. I was beginning to realise that
depression was affecting my health. Father never loved me. I think sometimes
that did he missed me? Did he kept cursing me? How many children do you have,
sister-in-law? I've a son, Ali. He must be cute like you. Are you married? You always told mom that daughters
of witches don't get married. I did get married, but we got divorced. It was a good thing. I know you won't ask, but I'll tell you anyway. Mom hasn't changed,
she still has an attitude, but I didn't see any change in father
for a long time after you left. But I wonder why he's been
mentioning a lot about you recently. Doesn't matter. It's been a long time. Yes, it's been a long time. But father has very less time. What do you mean? Father has cancer. He got diagnosed last year. He misses you a lot, sister. Will you come to see him? It's getting late, I must leave. Don't you dare! Don't you dare! Stay away from my daughter! I couldn't retaliate
earlier Abdullah Ahmed, but if you touch my daughter again,
I'll chop them off! Go away. Go! I can understand your problem but, Shameem your attitude
is very childish. The fear that your wife and
child's test might be positive, you don't want to get them treated. This isn't right. By doing this you're
increasing the risk factor. Look, living in denial
will get you nothing, except for pain. From where could
I muster the courage? I cannot tell them. How will I face them? The disease is not the problem. But your attitude certainly is a problem. The disease is manageable. but for that,
it has to be treated on time. And to start the treatment one
should get the tests done on time. So I advise you to get
your wife and son tested. And then the day came... ...which I feared. The blood test reports arrived. Blood test for HIV. Patient Ali Shameem, negative. Patient Umaina Shameem... ...positive.
