[239.84] - I thought you guys were coming tomorrow.
- Okay.
[242.24] I was over at my in-law's place,
[244.44] - to fix my brother-in-law's wedding.
- Okay.  That's why I got late.
[248.44] I hope you two had
no trouble coming here.
[250.40] No.
[251.32] Need help with that?
[252.68] No, no, it's okay.
[262.72] The place has been
closed for too long.
[265.60] It's in a bad state.
[267.12] I can get it cleaned up.
[270.36] No need, we'll manage.
[273.32] You guys don't have
pillows and blankets either.
[276.88] Can I get some?
[278.48] We'll be grateful if you can If
[281.40] you ever face water problems do
n't hesitate to tell me.
[283.48] Okay.
[284.24] I'll be back in a jiffy.
[285.68] Here's the key.
[326.44] That night felt like...
[330.96] ...we were sleeping in our graves.
[364.32] In your minds,
you had made a huge sacrifice,
[368.28] and buried yourselves in your tombs.
[371.72] But did you ever imagine,
[373.80] what will happen to those
you're leaving behind?
[378.68] Did you ever think about them?
[383.08] Maybe they can't tell you anything
[385.60] about the people they left behind.
[387.28] But there are a couple of
people who faced a lot of problems.
[392.84] Some of them are no longer with us, but
[397.76] to narrate the
other side of the story, I would
[401.00] like to invite Mr.
Shameem's family.
[404.92] Please come to the auditorium.
[433.72] We all know who your
eyes are searching for.
[437.92] Ali, isn't it?
[450.44] I can't read this.
[452.16] You'll have to read it.
[476.28] I didn't cry that day.
[482.08] I was completely quiet.
[485.52] No mischief,
[488.12] or demands,
[490.80] or questions,
[493.68] why did my parents leave me quietly?  That
[507.08] night when I was
knocking on my parent's door,
[513.12] there was a question on my mind, which I had to ask
[516.32] .
[520.12] But I lost courage as
soon as they opened the door.
[525.28] I wasn't ready to
believe at any cost,
[530.00] that my dad isn't my real father.
[537.56] - No.
- Hey!
[539.56] You don't know how to
bathe me properly.
[541.96] Only my dad knows how to
bathe me properly, aunty.
[544.44] Again aunty?
[545.84] I've told you not to call me aunt.
Call me mom.
[549.84] But I won't call him dad.
[553.32] What?  What did he say?
[555.04] Was he abusing me?
[556.00] He doesn't abuse.,
he's a decent kid.
[558.16] Be quiet.
[559.48] What did you say, son?
[561.76] I hate you.
[562.92] I don't like you at all.
I'll never call you dad.
[566.16] I'm not too keen to hear
you call me dad either.
[570.20] Bloody orphan.
[572.76] Don't call him an orphan.
[574.56] Why do you talk to him like this?
[576.28] What else do you call an orphan?
[578.80] Someday he will find out,
[581.44] that even Shameem
isn't his real father!
[584.04] Khurram,
[585.40] - for God's sake, what are... Be quiet.
- Your father left you in the dustbin.
[589.44] I am talking to you, son.
[591.44] He left you in the dustbin.
[593.68] That's where we got you from.
[595.20] Thankless kid!
[597.92] Ali.
[600.80] What have you done?
[602.60] Ali.
[604.20] Whenever mother would scold me,
[607.24] I would say that I am adopted.
[612.24] I was really adopted.
[615.36] Before I could understand
this situation,
[619.92] you two left me as well.
[624.04] Once again!
[629.96] Bay ji's rejection, hatred,
[635.00] was making sense to me.
[638.00] Maybe something was missing in me.
[641.80] Maybe I didn't have
the qualities of a son.
[654.52] Mom, Dad.
I could've told everyone in school... ...
[660.28] that I'm the AIDS kid,
[665.48] and undo everything you did.
[668.32] But no.
[672.08] I didn't do it.
[675.00] Do you know why?
[680.04] Because I loved you a lot.
[684.76] You may be far from me,
[689.72] but I didn't want to cause
you any pain.
[697.04] I didn't want you to die, dad.
[703.48] You always said I
do really good tricks,
[709.88] but you played the best trick on me.
[824.48] Are you hungry?
[834.20] Meaning we're still alive, Umi.
[842.08] I'll arrange for something.
[947.88] Why didn't you eat?
[954.76] I was thinking of Ali.
[955.84] I wonder if he's eaten or not.
[963.88] Humaira is his mother now.
[966.56] She must have fed her.
[969.56] He must have cried inconsolably.
[972.56] What have we decided?
[975.72] We'll never bring up this topic.
[983.76] Look Umi,
[985.84] we can die but we can't be cruel.
[989.04] I miss him and it's painful.
[993.04] When you make a
big decision in life,
[995.32] you have to stay firm on it, Shammo.
[998.72] We've closed all
paths for our return,
[1000.96] so let's not cry over it.
[1006.56] Have you forgotten all about him?
[1008.12] Don't you miss him?
[1012.32] I know he gets thirsty at night.
[1016.04] He wakes up in the
middle of the night.
[1017.32] He doesn't like blue.
[1018.76] He's allergic to several things.
[1020.48] He cannot digest junk food.
[1021.68] I've told Humaira everything.
[1024.68] She's his mother now.
She will take care of him.
[1028.40] And we won't discuss
this topic again.
[1032.72] If I ever start to stagger
then you must stop me.
[1068.80] Umi, I thought we're
going to die anyway, so
[1073.76] why don't we die comfortably.
[1078.96] The evenings in that
region were beautiful.
[1083.20] Watching the scarlet sunset,
[1088.56] as life slowly faded away.
[1092.76] Shameem was right.
[1095.44] There was no better place to die.
[1129.16] - Greetings, madam.
- Greetings.
[1131.32] Sorry, we don't have anything.
[1132.72] I am not a beggar, madam.
[1135.28] I'm looking for work.
Do you have any work?
[1139.80] He's my son.
[1142.48] He just tagged along.
[1143.36] - I can make him sit at the back if you want.
- No, no, it's okay.
[1146.00] - Come here, my child.
- But we don't have any work.
[1148.20] I am in desperate
need of work, madam.
[1150.80] Any work at all.
[1152.16] Cleaning, mopping, waxing, massage.
[1156.16] Madam, I can even deliver kids.
[1159.08] I am also a midwife in this area.
[1160.76] Bablu, come here.
[1162.28] Please give me some work, madam.
[1164.32] We're in dire straights.
[1166.40] We are facing a cash crunch.
[1168.60] All our huts are empty.
[1172.04] Please give me some work.
[1176.00] Sit down, Bablu.
[1179.36] I'll ask sir and let you know.
[1182.24] Thank you very much, madam.
[1184.00] I'll be grateful.
[1185.00] Come here, Bablu.
Come on, let's go home.
[1187.80] Let's go home, son.
Don't sleep here.
[1190.88] My sweet child.  Bravo.
[1195.08] Madam, do I get the job?
[1200.16] I'll ask sir and let you know.
[1201.28] Thank you very much, madam.
[1202.48] May Allah bless you with happiness.
[1205.40] God bless you.
[1229.60] But...
[1232.44] We don't need a maid
for such a small place.
[1236.48] She was pleading continuously.
[1238.44] We stay sick all the time.
[1241.08] This way she will get a job,
[1243.08] and we'll have an
extra pair of hands.
[1290.28] Honestly, Bay ji.
[1293.20] Shameem personally gave this to me.
[1300.56] Bay ji, if you doubt
Abdullah's intentions, then...
[1308.80] Why would I doubt anyone?
[1313.24] If Shammo's done this
then he must be right.
[1316.52] He's given me such
a big responsibility.
[1319.16] Especially the responsibility
of supporting Ali.
[1322.00] I wanted to return
everything to him.
[1325.08] But I wonder where he disappeared to
after handing this over.
[1327.92] God knows where he went.
[1331.28] Unbelievable.
[1333.36] Even after you treated
him so unfairly and selfishly,
[1336.32] he saw some good in you.
[1339.16] And even though he
had many good qualities,
[1342.16] you couldn't even notice one in him.
[1355.96] Clear my space.
[1357.88] It's not your father's bed.
[1361.20] How are you talking to my son?
[1364.92] Your son?
[1366.24] This puppy...
[1369.72] Ali!
[1370.60] Son, go and play outside, okay.
[1373.16] Good boy.
[1373.88] I'll join you in a while.  Do
[1381.56] n't you dare talk
to my son like this,
[1384.08] I'll yank your tongue out.
[1385.40] You'll yank my tongue out?
[1387.28] You begged and pleaded
for me to come back.
[1389.52] "I want a child."
[1393.16] That rascal Shameem
gave everything to Abdullah.
[1397.80] I see?
[1400.00] He did the right thing.  Did
[1404.76] he do the right thing?
[1407.16] Have you lost your mind?
[1412.00] Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
[1417.08] Humaira, I hope you aren't fooling me.
[1420.32] Was this a trick to get the child?
[1423.96] Why?  I am your wife after all.
[1427.04] I must have learned
something in your company.
[1429.08] All these years you
kept playing tricks on me,
[1431.36] don't I deserve to play one on you?
[1434.56] Look Humaira,
I'll leave you for good.
[1438.60] Then you'll miss me and cry.
[1441.20] Okay, go.
[1443.80] Anyway,
you couldn't give me a child.
[1446.24] So be it.
[1447.80] Go on.
[1452.40] Don't just stand there
and stare at my face.
[1454.56] Leave.
[1458.56] Are you drunk?
[1461.68] Look Humaira,
[1463.52] I am leaving.
[1465.48] Do as you please.
[1466.52] Enjoy your "child".
[1476.12] Where is my bag?
[1480.04] Where is my money?
[1482.08] Humaira, where's my...
[1489.44] Look, don't do this to me.
[1492.28] You are my sweet wife.
[1494.40] You've kept all my money.  It
[1499.32] doesn't matter who keeps the money.
[1502.28] But don't throw me out of the house.
[1505.36] I don't have a penny.
Where will I go?
[1508.00] Not my problem.
[1511.24] What's wrong with you?
[1513.52] You're a woman.
How will you survive without a man?
[1518.88] I'm not alone.
[1520.08] I have a son now.  He'll look after me.
[1523.48] That rugrat.
[1525.28] He can't even clean
himself properly.
[1527.12] I'll teach him everything.
[1528.96] How a man should be.
[1531.16] Not like you,
[1533.08] someone who respects women.
[1534.96] Like his father Shameem.
[1536.88] You want to be his father?
[1539.80] Bloody impotent.
[1540.92] Enough!  I've heard enough rubbish.
[1544.72] If you utter another word,
[1546.76] then I'll divorce you.
[1549.80] You'll divorce me?
[1550.76] Yes, I will.
[1553.28] Fine, I divorce you then.
[1558.16] Divorce!  Divorce!  Divorce!
[1561.72] Go to hell!
[1581.72] I think you want to say something.
[1584.08] Please give her a mic.
[1603.44] If women decide to be firm,
[1607.92] no man can ever break her.
[1614.52] You got divorced.
[1617.40] Didn't you ever feel lonely?
[1622.32] A woman feels complete
not by a husband,
[1625.36] but by her child.
[1629.40] And I had found him.
[1635.08] My son.
[1638.04] My Ali.
[1642.68] And you?
[1644.72] According to this,
you made yourself incomplete.
[1649.84] How did the loneliness
on that hill station feel?
[1658.00] We were honestly very lonely,
[1662.68] and also incomplete.
[1666.20] But for a change,
[1670.44] there was no one between us.
[1677.44] Neither Bilal, nor our family,
[1680.72] nor Ali.
[1684.52] Just the two of us.
[1694.76] We had left all the goals
of life behind.
[1702.60] We thought life was over for us.
[1709.52] But it's very stubborn.
[1716.28] You don't even realize
when it bounces back.
[1720.60] And makes a relationship
with you like water.
[1724.96] Mister, don't you sound weird.
[1727.76] People go to the city to find work.
[1729.96] What work will you get out of here?
[1732.40] I was asking since
this is a tourist area...
[1735.96] ...and all the guest
houses and hotels are here.
[1738.44] There must be a job here somewhere.
[1740.60] Must...
[1743.80] You guys are fast learners.
[1746.12] There's a guesthouse here.
[1748.12] Come with me.
[1749.52] Let's go talk to the owner.
[1751.20] Come on.
[1751.96] Let's go.
[1764.28] Hasan?
[1765.36] Yes.
[1766.20] Who is this man?
[1768.24] He's a very interesting man, boss.
[1770.96] He is educated and can
handle all the paperwork.
[1773.28] No.
[1775.16] What if he starts doing
some other work here?
[1777.92] No, boss.  He is a good man.
[1781.16] What is the term...
[1783.52] You won't need to hire
a female receptionist.
[1786.16] No, no, I don't want this guy.
[1788.20] Go on.  Leave.
[1789.28] I don't want this guy.
[1791.92] Let me work.
[1792.92] Go.
[1802.96] Wait a minute.  Stop.
[1804.96] Where are you going?
Listen to me.
[1807.60] Where are you going?
[1808.96] This place is filled with
illiterate and ignorant people.
[1812.44] You educated people won't last here.
[1815.20] Doesn't matter.
I'll look for a job somewhere else.
[1818.12] Don't worry.
[1819.08] You guys are always in a hurry.
[1821.32] I spoke to the boss.
[1823.16] I begged him.
[1824.68] He has agreed to hire you.
[1827.28] You can join from tomorrow.
[1830.68] Okay, thank you very much.
I am obliged.
[1835.08] Doesn't matter.
[1840.28] Tomorrow morning at 8.
[1869.92] Umi.
[1874.12] Congratulations, I got a job.
[1878.20] Yes.
[1879.12] Baaji sir gave me
a job at his guesthouse.
[1882.60] Congratulations.
[1885.04] They are beautiful.
[1886.48] Are you tired?
[1888.12] I'll get some water.
[1920.48] Madam, why did you
lay him on the bed?
[1925.12] He'll soil the bed.
[1929.12] Okay, as you wish.
[1947.36] Madam, can I ask you
something if you don't mind?
[1953.08] Ask.
[1954.04] Madam, don't you have children?
[1966.20] How long have you two been married?
[1973.32] Eight years.
[1976.28] Eight years?
[1981.68] This shouldn't be
taken lightly, madam.
[1985.08] It's not good.
[1987.16] Madam...
[1990.00] Madam, can I give you an advice?
[1993.80] There's a wise old
man who lives close by.
[1999.24] He's got a shrine.
[2001.52] People come from far
and wide to pray there.
[2005.80] It cures even the worst disease.
[2010.16] You guys are from the city.
[2013.28] I know you won't
believe in such things.
[2015.32] But on my advice,
you must visit that place once.
[2021.84] By Allah,
madam, your wish will be fulfilled.
[2027.80] Can I sleep next to him?
[2033.16] He'll soil your clothes.
[2035.60] I don't mind.
[2037.92] As you wish, madam.
[2064.96] Why do you want to go to the shrine?
[2067.52] Because I want to.
[2069.76] I've never gone anywhere
since we got here.
[2071.80] This way we can have a look around.
[2076.16] I'm tired.
[2078.12] I know.
[2079.44] You've put on weight
sitting at home.
[2081.48] Give me your hand.
[2083.16] Give me your hand.
[2084.48] Just keep quiet and come with me.
[2088.00] Look how beautiful that mountain is.
[2120.24] We have to live as
long as we are alive.
[2124.28] Maybe even in that spell of despair,
[2126.36] we were finding our little joys.
[2131.08] Maybe we had left one
door of our desires ajar,
[2137.16] and the breeze of love
was provoking us to live again.
[2193.52] What did you pray for, Umi?
[2197.00] Peace.
[2203.24] And you?
[2208.16] Justice.
