What could be worse for a child, when his childhood
is taken away from him. Do you want ice cream? Give me some more. I began hating all
my favorite toys, which my father insisted on buying. Even if they grew old, I would never let my
father discard my toys. But I was discarded now. Yes, I'm the winner. Champion!  Champion!  Champion! You know, dad. You're the best dad in the world. There's none like you. Really? I love you so much dad,
you're the best. You're the best too. Now tell me something, if I'm not the best,
will you not love me? I don't know, but you're the perfect dad. And you're my perfect Ali. You know what, when you love someone they do
n't have to be perfect. He can have many bad qualities too. So if you love him, then you should forget
his bad qualities. Just like you love mom, and she bothers her so much. It's only her way of showing love. She's your mom.  She can do anything. Ali... If your friend says
anything bad about me, then what will you do? - I will kick him.
- No! Don't kick him! No! Give him a smile. If someone says something bad, just ignore them. Dad, you're so funny. Really? And you are so funny too. You're always very funny. You're very funny. You're much funnier than me. You're much funnier than me. Papa-mama had left
these toys for me. But they left me too. Look, Chotu.  Isn't it cute? See... Spiderman. Madam, why did you take the trouble? Did you buy such a beautiful
toy especially for Bablu? No, it belongs to someone. Did. Belonged to someone. Who? Someone who was very
close to my heart. And now it's Chotu. Madam, please don't
spoil his habits. He doesn't even come to me anymore. He's taken a liking to you. Me too. Did you like this gift? Stop staring at me, Shameem. We made a decision. I haven't crossed any line. You gave this woman a
job for the sake of this child. Yes, I employed her
for the sake of her child, but he's not Ali. Yes, but you're trying
to look for Ali in him. - That's not true.
- It is the truth. It's the only truth. You tried to explain to me and now... Look we didn't leave our old
relationships and our child behind, to make new relationships here. We would rather have died back home. Tell her not to come tomorrow. I can't do that. Why? What do you mean by why, Shameem? She came to me with
a lot of expectations, how can I say no? How is that poor woman at fault? We have nothing to offer
except for disappointment. And you're giving people hope. If you can't say no, then tell her to
keep her child at home. - Shameem, but
- But what? What? I am also a human being. I know I am dying,
but I am not dead yet. After a point, logic ceases to exist,
in fact everything ceases to exist, except for a mother who
is pining for her child. What do I do about her?
How do I subdue her? What are you doing, Shameem? We're going back right now. We're not going anywhere. If you can't control your emotions, then we should go back. I don't want to go back. Look, if you want to
make your death difficult, then why not die
in front of our own kid. Let's make his life
hell and die peacefully. I won't meet that child again.
I won't pick him up in my arms. I won't love him. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Bay ji. Bay ji, they have arrived. God bless you. Bless you. It took so long to meet mother. I missed you, Bay ji. God bless you. Come here, my boy.
Come here, my boy. - Ali, how are you?
- He is so handsome. Come on, let's go inside.  Come on. Come. Let's play a game. Any news about brother Shameem? Where is he? No one knows. They left one night
without informing anyone. Since then there has
been no news about them. Ali, join us. Come on. Shameem. You okay? - Caught you.  Caught you.
- Cheating. - Caught you.  Caught you.
- Cheating. Caught you. We caught mom. Now it's mom's turn. No, no. It's Ali's turn. And Ali? Is he like this? Madam, if you want you can
lie down next to Bablu. Welcome.  Welcome back, sir. You have come back to our guest house, after a long time. You know a new government has been formed. So, I was busy with official work. This way please. Send some tea here, quickly. This way, sir. Where? Abbasi sir, it's quitting time. No quitting time for you. We've had guests over. Who is going to do the work? Come on, and sit on the chair. Come on. Quitting time. Why do I get all the useless ones? Get to work. Did you say something? No. Strange. Where is he? Where did you send him? Is this the time? Be mindful. You come and stand at the door! This is a limit. Hey, where is the cook? Where did you send him? Irfan went home, Abbasi sir,
he'll come back at 7 am now. Oh no. The markets must be closed as well. What do I do? If the senior officer gets hungry,
then I'll be humiliated. We can send the driver to the city, and get food from some restaurant. Be quiet you stupid fool. It's too late. What should I do? I am worried sick. Don't worry. Give me some time and
I'll see what I can do. What can you do? What are you doing? Don't worry. I am not such a bad cook. Our Bay ji taught us,
siblings, everything. We used to hold cooking
competitions at home. Either I would win or Humaira. You and Bay ji. If Malik sir gets sick
after eating your food, then I will fire you from the job. Then make it yourself. Listen here, are you the boss or me? Who does this guest house belong to? I can yell at you. Okay, do it.  Don't get angry. Looks nice.  Also got a nice aroma. Go on. Who is it? It's me, Umi. What happened? Umaira. Umi... What's wrong? What's the matter? Where were you? I was late because
I was cooking some food. Do you know, Umi, they liked my food so much, that they pounced 
on it like wild cats. In fact, they didn't
even leave any bones behind. Malik sir was extremely happy. He insisted that he
wants this cook every time. In fact, Abbasi sir who
always has a sulking face, was happy as well. He was so happy that
he made me permanent. Later he packed this
food for me as well, and said I should take it home. Eat with your wife.  Have fun. Today I realized the difference
between boss and employee. Tastes exactly the same. You had cooked the food, during my first visit to
your home with Salma. Remember? I remember every moment. I even remember that
you were wearing a white top, and a baby pink color scarf. And your jeans were
torn at the knee. And when Bay ji arrived, you immediately covered
your knees with your bag. What else do you remember? I remember everything
from our first meeting to this day. I never looked anywhere
except for you. And I was so dumb, who always looked somewhere else. You must feel angry with me,
Shameem? Umi, those who claim to be in love, actually only love themselves. They don't want
to change themselves, they want to change others. The real fun is in changing
yourself for someone. That's why I loved
you the way you were. I never felt anything
other than love for you. - Umi, you know what?
- What? Let's play a game. What game?  I don't want to run. It's not running. Then? You pretend to be the old Shameem, and I'll be that old Umi. I don't want to play
these childish games. It is not a childish game. - I don't want to play...
- Bloody Shammo, get lost from here. Huh? I'll hit you, Shammo. I never talked like this. Don't interrupt,
just listen to the beauty. Okay, Ms.  World. Ms.  World? Ms.  The world's nothing compared to me. My pampered beauty. You are jealous of me. You dress like men, and you smoke. You look characterless. Don't talk about
your cartoon character, or I will teach you
a lesson in character. Which side are you
from, boys or girls? I wonder what elixir or potion, Shameem had mixed in that wok, which coursed through
my entire body as life. Maybe it was an emotion that
I had never experienced before. Or maybe... it was love. Definitely, this is love. Ali... come on. Look, everyone is enjoying themselves so much. Come on. What are you doing?  Come over here. Why are you forcing him
if he doesn't want to come? I told you not to
bring him along. Do you want to take this ride now? Picture.  Picture. One picture. - Ali.
- Okay, let's go. Ali. Ali. Ali. Where is he? What do you mean? Where did you leave my child? How could you two
return home without him? Bay ji, it wasn't intentional.
You can ask him. Ask him what?  Where is my child? We looked everywhere for him. We even made an
announcement in the park, but couldn't find him. Oh God, where do I go look for him now? How will I ever face them now? How will I face my
brother and sister-in-law? What will I say to them? Calm down. Like they cared. In fact, we got a bad
name for doing a good deed. What nonsense is she talking about? I told you not to take him along.
But you never listen to me. Ayaan is scared of
his strange behavior. But you never listen to me. Bay ji, she will drive me crazy. Where is my child?
Where is my child? Stop your wailing!
Stop your wailing! I believe you. Now, will you go
looking for the child? Did someone abduct him
or got in an accident... Stop it, Bay ji, you will all drive me crazy. - My heart will explode.
- Calm down. I am going. Someone stop her.  Don't go. Don't go, Humaira. I had a word with... He's on his way. Bay ji, I didn't do it on purpose. - Keep quiet.
- He is coming. - Where did you leave him?
- We are doomed. My son! My son! Greetings, have you seen the child? We were here in the evening. Please take a good look at it. What happened, Shameem? What happened? Did you see a nightmare? Shameem? Water. Drink some water. What is it?  Did you see a nightmare? I did too.  God bless us all. Drink some water. What happened? Shameem?  What happened? I got scared. It's okay.  I am there. Lie down next to me for some time. Lie down, I'm right here. Madam, are you in pain? Yes. Can I give you a massage?
I am very good at it. You'll feel much better. Just lie down. So, madam, I was telling you... I helped in the birth of all four children of the local MLA. As I said, I am the
midwife in this area. His wife never goes to the doctor. She says just call Shabana. Madam. Madam. We must inform his parents now. Do you know anyone from
sister-in-law Umaina's family? Maybe they are there
or they know something. Why doesn't anyone
pick up the phone? It keeps on ringing. Ouch. Hello. Who is it? Who is it? Oh no. There's a shortage
of gas cylinders here. It wasn't easy to
find this one, Umi. No one takes you seriously
until you have big contacts. I told Abbasi sir to make a call, and got this cylinder. Are you okay? I'm pregnant, Shameem. What?
