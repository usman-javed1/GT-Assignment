[120.20] What could be worse for a child,
[123.92] when his childhood
is taken away from him.
[143.80] Do you want ice cream?
[153.04] Give me some more.
[175.08] I began hating all
my favorite toys,
[177.48] which my father insisted on buying.
[180.96] Even if they grew old,
[182.88] I would never let my
father discard my toys.
[187.08] But I was discarded now.
[195.16] Yes, I'm the winner.
[196.48] Champion!  Champion!  Champion!
[200.20] You know, dad.
[202.60] You're the best dad in the world.
[205.40] There's none like you.
[207.20] Really?
[208.84] I love you so much dad,
you're the best.
[211.48] You're the best too.
[215.60] Now tell me something,
[217.20] if I'm not the best,
will you not love me?
[222.88] I don't know,
[223.84] but you're the perfect dad.
[227.60] And you're my perfect Ali.
[230.68] You know what,
[233.76] when you love someone they do
n't have to be perfect.
[239.36] He can have many bad qualities too.
[242.72] So if you love him,
[244.76] then you should forget
his bad qualities.
[247.20] Just like you love mom,
[248.84] and she bothers her so much.
[250.84] It's only her way of showing love.
[252.48] She's your mom.  She can do anything.
[255.48] Ali...
[258.60] If your friend says
anything bad about me,
[264.72] then what will you do?
[266.08] - I will kick him.
- No!
[269.00] Don't kick him!
[270.60] No!
[272.16] Give him a smile.
[275.28] If someone says something bad,
[276.92] just ignore them.
[283.52] Dad, you're so funny.
[285.52] Really?
[286.44] And you are so funny too.
[290.56] You're always very funny.
[292.68] You're very funny.
[293.84] You're much funnier than me.
[295.76] You're much funnier than me.
[299.04] Papa-mama had left
these toys for me.
[303.80] But they left me too.
[327.72] Look, Chotu.  Isn't it cute?
[333.48] See...
[335.08] Spiderman.
[343.20] Madam, why did you take the trouble?
[345.96] Did you buy such a beautiful
toy especially for Bablu?
[352.24] No, it belongs to someone.
[355.16] Did.
[356.44] Belonged to someone.
[357.68] Who?
[360.20] Someone who was very
close to my heart.
[364.12] And now it's Chotu.
[365.24] Madam, please don't
spoil his habits.
[368.20] He doesn't even come to me anymore.
[370.76] He's taken a liking to you.
[373.08] Me too.
[375.16] Did you like this gift?
[429.36] Stop staring at me, Shameem.
[431.76] We made a decision.
[433.40] I haven't crossed any line.
[435.16] You gave this woman a
job for the sake of this child.
[439.72] Yes, I employed her
for the sake of her child,
[441.16] but he's not Ali.
[442.04] Yes, but you're trying
to look for Ali in him.
[443.68] - That's not true.
- It is the truth.
[446.44] It's the only truth.
[448.48] You tried to explain to me and now...
[452.20] Look we didn't leave our old
relationships and our child behind, to make
[457.20] new relationships here.
[458.60] We would rather have died back home.
[461.96] Tell her not to come tomorrow.
[464.00] I can't do that.
[465.12] Why?
[466.48] What do you mean by why, Shameem?
[468.40] She came to me with
a lot of expectations,
[470.72] how can I say no?
[472.24] How is that poor woman at fault?
[474.08] We have nothing to offer
except for disappointment.
[477.08] And you're giving people hope.
[479.80] If you can't say no,
[481.12] then tell her to
keep her child at home.
[484.24] - Shameem, but
- But what?
[486.48] What?
[487.68] I am also a human being.
[490.68] I know I am dying,
but I am not dead yet.
[494.36] After a point, logic ceases to exist,
in fact everything ceases to exist,
[497.60] except for a mother who
is pining for her child.
[501.92] What do I do about her?
How do I subdue her?
[515.68] What are you doing, Shameem?
[516.84] We're going back right now.
[517.80] We're not going anywhere.
[518.88] If you can't control your emotions,
[520.60] then we should go back.
[522.00] I don't want to go back.
[523.60] Look, if you want to
make your death difficult,
[526.04] then why not die
in front of our own kid.
[528.60] Let's make his life
hell and die peacefully.
[532.24] I won't meet that child again.
I won't pick him up in my arms.
[535.68] I won't love him.
[538.00] Sorry.
[540.00] Sorry.
[541.88] Sorry.
[554.60] Bay ji.
[556.88] Bay ji, they have arrived.
[565.52] God bless you.
[567.36] Bless you.
[569.08] It took so long to meet mother.
[572.76] I missed you, Bay ji.
[576.00] God bless you.
[580.68] Come here, my boy.
Come here, my boy.
[585.96] - Ali, how are you?
- He is so handsome.
[593.76] Come on, let's go inside.  Come on.
[595.72] Come.
[600.32] Let's play a game.
[628.24] Any news about brother Shameem?
[630.12] Where is he?
[635.84] No one knows.
[639.32] They left one night
without informing anyone.
[645.04] Since then there has
been no news about them.
[650.68] Ali, join us.
[653.32] Come on.
[659.68] Shameem.
[661.08] You okay?
[663.72] - Caught you.  Caught you.
- Cheating.
[665.72] - Caught you.  Caught you.
- Cheating.
[667.72] Caught you.
[670.96] We caught mom.
[673.72] Now it's mom's turn.
[675.84] No, no.
[678.48] It's Ali's turn.
[689.56] And Ali?
[693.40] Is he like this?
[726.24] Madam,
[728.80] if you want you can
lie down next to Bablu.
[754.84] Welcome.  Welcome back, sir.
[757.00] You have come back to our guest house,
[759.20] after a long time.
[761.12] You know a new government has been formed.
[763.32] So, I was busy with official work.
[765.04] This way please.
[766.00] Send some tea here, quickly.
[768.28] This way, sir.
[797.28] Where?
[801.08] Abbasi sir, it's quitting time.
[802.48] No quitting time for you.
[804.56] We've had guests over.
[805.88] Who is going to do the work?
[807.28] Come on, and sit on the chair.
[810.32] Come on.
[816.96] Quitting time.
[822.48] Why do I get all the useless ones?
[824.88] Get to work.
[830.40] Did you say something?
[832.12] No.
[833.76] Strange.
[865.08] Where is he?
[866.68] Where did you send him?
[868.48] Is this the time?
[869.40] Be mindful.
[871.16] You come and stand at the door!
[873.56] This is a limit.
[882.00] Hey, where is the cook?
[884.08] Where did you send him?
[886.84] Irfan went home, Abbasi sir,
he'll come back at 7 am now.
[890.84] Oh no.
[892.60] The markets must be closed as well.
[894.80] What do I do?
[895.88] If the senior officer gets hungry,
then I'll be humiliated.
[901.36] We can send the driver to the city,
[902.96] and get food from some restaurant.
[905.04] Be quiet you stupid fool.
[907.20] It's too late.
[908.96] What should I do?
[909.88] I am worried sick.
[912.52] Don't worry.
[913.44] Give me some time and
I'll see what I can do.
[916.16] What can you do?
[926.60] What are you doing?
[929.24] Don't worry.
[931.24] I am not such a bad cook.
[932.88] Our Bay ji taught us,
siblings, everything.
[936.04] We used to hold cooking
competitions at home.
[938.16] Either I would win or Humaira.
[940.24] You and Bay ji.
[942.52] If Malik sir gets sick
after eating your food,
[947.24] then I will fire you from the job.
[950.56] Then make it yourself.
[953.96] Listen here, are you the boss or me?
[957.16] Who does this guest house belong to?
[959.96] I can yell at you.
[964.72] Okay, do it.  Don't get angry.
[970.40] Looks nice.  Also got a nice aroma.
[973.00] Go on.
[1021.44] Who is it?
[1023.24] It's me, Umi.
[1030.16] What happened?
[1031.44] Umaira.
[1033.88] Umi...
[1037.04] What's wrong?
[1044.40] What's the matter?
[1045.68] Where were you?
[1049.80] I was late because
I was cooking some food.
[1061.40] Do you know, Umi,
[1063.52] they liked my food so much, that they pounced
[1066.12] 
on it like wild cats.
[1068.48] In fact, they didn't
even leave any bones behind.
[1072.80] Malik sir was extremely happy.
[1074.16] He insisted that he
wants this cook every time.
[1078.48] In fact, Abbasi sir who
always has a sulking face,
[1082.16] was happy as well.
[1084.32] He was so happy that
he made me permanent.
[1089.04] Later he packed this
food for me as well,
[1090.76] and said I should take it home.
[1092.04] Eat with your wife.  Have fun.
[1098.28] Today I realized the difference
between boss and employee.
[1103.92] Tastes exactly the same.
[1105.96] You had cooked the food,
[1109.00] during my first visit to
your home with Salma.
[1110.32] Remember?
[1114.04] I remember every moment.
[1117.28] I even remember that
you were wearing a white top,
[1121.96] and a baby pink color scarf.
[1124.40] And your jeans were
torn at the knee.
[1127.36] And when Bay ji arrived,
[1129.16] you immediately covered
your knees with your bag.
[1136.12] What else do you remember?
[1140.40] I remember everything
from our first meeting to this day.
[1148.16] I never looked anywhere
except for you.
[1157.80] And I was so dumb,
[1160.68] who always looked somewhere else.
[1164.96] You must feel angry with me,
Shameem?
[1173.80] Umi,
[1175.76] those who claim to be in love,
[1177.68] actually only love themselves.
[1180.28] They don't want
to change themselves,
[1182.68] they want to change others.
[1186.52] The real fun is in changing
yourself for someone.
[1192.56] That's why I loved
you the way you were.
[1198.44] I never felt anything
other than love for you.
[1224.52] - Umi, you know what?
- What?
[1228.08] Let's play a game.
[1229.52] What game?  I don't want to run.
[1231.20] It's not running.
[1232.44] Then?
[1233.28] You pretend to be the old Shameem,
[1234.92] and I'll be that old Umi.
[1236.72] I don't want to play
these childish games.
[1238.16] It is not a childish game.
[1239.40] - I don't want to play...
- Bloody Shammo,
[1242.04] get lost from here.
[1243.76] Huh?
[1245.28] I'll hit you, Shammo.
[1246.68] I never talked like this.
[1249.32] Don't interrupt,
just listen to the beauty.
[1256.24] Okay, Ms.  World.
[1259.08] Ms.  World?
[1261.00] Ms.  The world's nothing compared to me.
[1263.52] My pampered beauty.
[1267.44] You are jealous of me.
[1270.16] You dress like men,
[1272.72] and you smoke.
[1274.36] You look characterless.
[1276.00] Don't talk about
your cartoon character,
[1278.44] or I will teach you
a lesson in character.
[1283.12] Which side are you
from, boys or girls?
[1376.72] I wonder what elixir or potion, Shameem had
[1380.96] mixed in that wok,
[1388.32] which coursed through
my entire body as life.
[1398.16] Maybe it was an emotion that
I had never experienced before.
[1408.56] Or maybe...
[1412.16] it was love.
[1420.80] Definitely, this is love.
[1463.72] Ali...
[1466.16] come on.
[1467.32] Look, everyone is enjoying themselves so much.
[1469.28] Come on.
[1470.36] What are you doing?  Come over here.
[1476.80] Why are you forcing him
if he doesn't want to come?
[1479.84] I told you not to
bring him along.
[1485.08] Do you want to take this ride now?
[1486.68] Picture.  Picture.
[1487.84] One picture.
[1523.40] - Ali.
- Okay, let's go.
[1525.76] Ali.
[1533.00] Ali.
[1539.08] Ali.
[1542.44] Where is he?
[1581.16] What do you mean?
[1584.88] Where did you leave my child?
[1588.44] How could you two
return home without him?
[1592.52] Bay ji, it wasn't intentional.
You can ask him.
[1596.28] Ask him what?  Where is my child?
[1599.12] We looked everywhere for him.
[1600.96] We even made an
announcement in the park,
[1602.40] but couldn't find him.
[1604.16] Oh God, where do I go look for him now?
[1607.68] How will I ever face them now?
[1611.16] How will I face my
brother and sister-in-law?
[1614.16] What will I say to them?
[1615.76] Calm down.
[1617.36] Like they cared.
[1619.52] In fact, we got a bad
name for doing a good deed.
[1621.28] What nonsense is she talking about?
[1623.72] I told you not to take him along.
But you never listen to me.
[1627.40] Ayaan is scared of
his strange behavior.
[1630.60] But you never listen to me.
[1631.92] Bay ji, she will drive me crazy.
[1635.12] Where is my child?
Where is my child?
[1638.20] Stop your wailing!
Stop your wailing!
[1642.16] I believe you.
[1643.28] Now, will you go
looking for the child?
[1647.76] Did someone abduct him
or got in an accident...
[1651.08] Stop it, Bay ji,
[1652.28] you will all drive me crazy.
[1654.24] - My heart will explode.
- Calm down.
[1658.40] I am going.
[1660.80] Someone stop her.  Don't go.
[1662.76] Don't go, Humaira.
[1664.16] I had a word with...
[1666.16] He's on his way.
[1668.04] Bay ji, I didn't do it on purpose.
[1669.80] - Keep quiet.
- He is coming.
[1671.32] - Where did you leave him?
- We are doomed.
[1673.44] My son!
[1675.28] My son!
[1682.60] Greetings, have you seen the child?
[1686.16] We were here in the evening.
[1688.24] Please take a good look at it.
[1705.20] What happened, Shameem?
[1709.16] What happened?
[1711.60] Did you see a nightmare?
[1714.44] Shameem?
[1733.12] Water.
[1735.00] Drink some water.
[1736.60] What is it?  Did you see a nightmare?
[1740.48] I did too.  God bless us all.
[1743.16] Drink some water.
[1752.48] What happened?
[1754.28] Shameem?  What happened?
[1758.32] I got scared.
[1762.92] It's okay.  I am there.
[1767.28] Lie down next to me for some time.
[1773.12] Lie down, I'm right here.
[1815.68] Madam, are you in pain?
[1819.92] Yes.
[1821.56] Can I give you a massage?
I am very good at it.
[1827.96] You'll feel much better.
[1830.16] Just lie down.
[1845.48] So, madam, I was telling you...
[1849.88] I helped in the birth
[1853.44] of all four children of the local MLA.
[1858.72] As I said, I am the
midwife in this area.
[1864.12] His wife never goes to the doctor.
[1868.44] She says just call Shabana.
[1874.12] Madam.
[1878.32] Madam.
[1900.16] We must inform his parents now.
[1904.28] Do you know anyone from
sister-in-law Umaina's family?
[1908.60] Maybe they are there
or they know something.
[1962.48] Why doesn't anyone
pick up the phone?
[1965.96] It keeps on ringing.
[1967.80] Ouch.
[1972.68] Hello.
[1974.68] Who is it?
[1978.96] Who is it?
[2010.24] Oh no.
[2013.00] There's a shortage
of gas cylinders here.
[2015.68] It wasn't easy to
find this one, Umi.
[2019.04] No one takes you seriously
until you have big contacts.
[2024.96] I told Abbasi sir to make a call,
[2028.84] and got this cylinder.
[2032.96] Are you okay?
[2034.32] I'm pregnant, Shameem.
[2041.04] What?
