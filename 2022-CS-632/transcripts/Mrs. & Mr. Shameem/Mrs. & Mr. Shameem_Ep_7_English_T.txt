[92.44] You think I feel no discomfort.
[96.48] I feel no pain.
[100.20] I want to forget everything,
[104.28] but you don't let me.
[108.80] You wanted me,
[110.96] then come and get me.
[114.20] Stop it.
[118.48] Look Shameem,
I don't want any connection with my past.
[126.40] Let me move forward.
[129.60] With him around, I can never move forward.
[134.92] Forget him.
[136.48] Stop it.
[147.44] I won't ask you about him anymore.
[158.56] I won't.
[163.92] Sleep.
[169.44] Sleep.
[173.60] I won't ask anymore.
[260.08] Yes?
[261.92] Who is it?
[267.96] You?
[274.00] Who is she?
[274.88] She's a friend's wife.
[277.12] - They are having some problems-
- But what is she doing here, Bilal?
[278.92] I'll talk to her.  You go inside.
[280.04] - But-
- I said go inside!
[282.28] Go inside!
[286.80] What are you doing here?
Come with me.
[290.88] Have you lost your mind?
[292.44] I have a reputation in this neighborhood.
[293.40] Why did you come here?
[296.92] Why did you come here?
[297.56] Are you crazy?
[300.36] I've come to return what's yours.
[302.44] Here's your child.
I can't take care of it.
[304.08] Umaina...
[312.68] What happened to your pride now?
[314.96] You slammed the door on
my face and left with Shameem!
[318.12] So what now?
[319.60] What's wrong?  Are you scared?
[321.80] Couldn't keep the child for even two days!
[323.04] Why should he raise your child?
[325.08] He's your child, you raise him.
[327.00] Did I tell you to give birth to him?
Did I?
[331.04] You had this inclination!
You take care of it!
[335.32] Keep me away from this filth!
[341.80] This is your filth, you keep it.
[345.56] And do what?  Do
[346.84] whatever you please Throw
[348.08] it away, kill it, do
[349.68] whatever you please with it
[350.80] He's a part of you, so keep him.  Quiet
[354.04] !
[356.16] I get your plan now.
[358.96] I get it now.
[360.36] You're trying to blackmail now.
[362.84] You're trying to ruin my family
because you couldn't settle down yourself.
[365.92] Shameless, characterless woman!
[367.88] What do you want?
[370.04] What do you want?
[371.08] Do you want money?
[371.96] How much money do you want?
[374.24] I'll f*** throw it on your face!
[379.28] I'm ashamed to love a man like you.
[386.20] I am embarrassed.
[389.52] I've already committed the
sin of giving birth to him,
[392.80] but his blood won't be on my hands.
[394.52] Keep him.
[396.60] Umaina, where are you going?
[398.68] Umaina, take him along.
What will I do with him?
[400.56] Umaina...
[402.48] Damn it.
[403.96] I'll leave it here.
[405.44] I'll leave it...
[407.40] What do I do?
[409.80] I'm leaving it out here.
[419.80] How can you do this?
[421.88] How can you do this?
[423.28] Kill me.  I don't want to live.
[425.20] Do it properly.
[426.24] Right here.
[427.40] Kill me.  Kill me!
[431.64] You can treat yourself
in any way you like.
[434.24] But he's my child.
[435.40] He's not your child!
[437.32] I've returned him to
the filth he belonged to.
[445.12] Your hatred has made you
a completely different person.
[448.32] Even a demon doesn't
treat his children this way.
[458.20] I am neither human nor a demon.
[461.96] I am a dead body.
[462.80] You're living with a dead body,
and I wonder why.
[465.24] Don't I stink,
[467.08] like a rotten dead body?
[469.36] And my child had to be like me.
[472.16] Lifeless...
[474.48] Imagine a dead body
giving birth to its death.
[480.32] Don't you dare utter such words for him?
[485.64] Hatred has polluted your heart.
[489.52] But his father is still alive.
[491.80] I will bring him back to this house.
[494.36] Are you listening?
[495.40] I will bring him back to this house.
[498.68] Leave him alone.  He's dead.
[502.36] It wasn't easy for me to leave him.
[504.92] Shameem!
[532.80] Who is it?
[533.80] You...
[536.48] Where is Ali?
[537.56] Where is Ali?
[538.44] - Shameem-
-Tell me where is Ali.
[539.88] I swear on Umi, I will break your head...
[543.32] Tell me, where is Ali?
[544.36] No, Shameem, don't...
[546.08] I left him at the EDHI Centre.
[653.04] Bay ji.
[655.24] Hey, Shameem is back!
[660.16] Shammo.
[836.20] Humaira, don't touch him.
[839.96] What are you doing?
[840.96] I have to feed him.
[842.88] Mind your own business.
[846.08] My baby...
[852.04] Calm down.
[858.84] Come on, come on, come on.
[860.36] Come on, come on, come on.
[862.12] Come on, come on, come on.
[863.56] Come on, come on, come on.
[865.36] Come on, come on, come on.
[873.36] Yes.
[934.56] Coming.
[941.96] Are you hungry?
[944.80] Milk will be ready in a couple of minutes.
[950.24] Ali..
[952.52] Ali..
[954.36] Ali?
[959.00] Ali..
[960.96] Ali..
[963.96] Umi...
[965.44] Ali..
[968.28] Ali..
[969.96] Ali..
[971.08] Ali., he isn't getting up.
[973.08] He isn't speaking.
[975.04] Ali...
[976.56] Ali...
[977.20] Stop eating for God's sake!
[979.96] Ali..
[981.56] Ali... Ali...
[985.16] Ali..
[996.28] I've never seen such negligence before.
[999.48] Have you seen his condition?
[1002.08] He's in a terrible state.
[1006.36] If you were in some western country,
[1008.80] you two would be facing legal charges.
[1012.88] Is she not feeding him?
[1018.24] She is unwell.
[1022.40] Mr.  Shameem, I've repeatedly said,
[1025.08] this child needs mother's milk.
[1027.92] He cannot digest anything else.
[1031.40] His immune system
will completely collapse.
[1035.40] He can't survive like this.
[1039.52] Tell me what I should do.
[1042.20] I'm prepared to do anything you say.
[1044.80] Bring his mother over,
[1046.52] and I'll speak to her personally.
[1049.08] No medicine, no treatment will work,
[1051.20] if she doesn't feed him her milk.
[1055.36] Ali repeatedly kept getting sick.
[1062.84] He had to be taken
to the hospital regularly.
[1068.52] Glucose or something else...
[1076.44] He had to be given various drips.
[1083.84] But he didn't need any of it.
[1094.36] He needed the nectar
from his mother's bosom,
[1106.96] which God gave him a right to.
[1121.20] Umi...
[1122.60] Umi...
[1124.08] For God's sake,
please put an end to his suffering,
[1126.80] and yours too.
[1127.96] Feed him.
[1130.96] Umi!
[1132.84] How can you be so merciless?
[1134.20] Don't you feel any pity for this child?
[1136.44] Get lost.
[1138.12] Come, my child.
[1140.00] Come, my child.
[1142.08] Come on.
[1157.80] Evolution.
[1159.96] Phylogenesis.
[1162.80] I read somewhere that
nature doesn't tolerate mistakes.
[1167.52] It devours the weak on its own.
[1175.24] In the battle of survival of the fittest,
[1178.64] it never sides with the weak.
[1183.32] There was a similar war of
survival ensued between my son and me.
[1190.60] I wanted to erase this
mistake from existence.
[1261.52] Hey...
[1262.96] Hey...
[1265.12] I wanted to get rid of him,
[1267.48] as the last memory of Bilal.
[1271.00] But he wasn't ready to release
me from my guilt at any cost.
[1309.56] Sale on kids' stuff.
[1313.36] It's a steal...
Grab them before they're gone.
[1315.64] Children will be happy.
[1317.80] Buy them now.
[1320.84] Sale.  Sale.
[1322.04] Only 30 rupees, sister.
[1324.84] Don't think, sister, buy it now.
[1328.40] It's a steal... Only 30 rupees.
[1330.40] Sale.  Sale.
[1332.24] Sale.  Sale.
[1334.36] Only 30 rupees
[1335.28] Wait sister, take something for your kids.
[1340.04] Only 30 rupees, sister.
[1341.84] No.
[1344.68] Just take it,
sister, your children will be happy.
[1348.04] Sale.  Sale.
[1349.80] Only 30 rupees.  Only 30 rupees.
[1352.04] Only 30 rupees.  Only 30 rupees.
[1353.52] Go for it, brother.  It's a steal deal.
[1356.28] They're very cheap.
[1358.52] You won't find them...
[1370.84] Excuse me?
[1372.20] Half a kilo of onions, a quarter
of ginger and two kilos of tomatoes.
[1376.08] Okay.
[1376.60] And a handful of coriander leaves.
[1389.48] Three kilos of potatoes,
[1391.12] along with two kilos
of cucumber and onions.
[1393.04] Haven't cleared your past dues yet,
[1394.64] and now you're back for more credit.
[1396.24] Get lost.
[1397.40] Here's your godforsaken money!
[1399.40] You just wait.
[1401.00] Here you go.
And don't talk nonsense to me.
[1405.32] I must admit you've been
living it up these days.
[1409.36] Gold chain.
[1410.92] If you set eyes on my chain again,
I'll gouge your eyes out!
[1418.12] Keep your vegetables.
[1419.56] There are better places around here.
[1422.12] Take your vegetables.
[1424.96] See sister,
even maids have a lifestyle these days.
[1429.08] But I know better.
[1431.24] Their job is cleaning
but spread filth instead.
[1555.60] Humaira.
[1560.92] Humaira.
[1565.56] I've been hollering for half an hour.
[1567.44] Where the hell were you?
[1569.60] I was at the market.
[1572.52] It's become your favorite place recently.
[1574.52] At the market.
[1576.84] You feel bored at home.
[1581.84] Was it the market you went to?
[1585.56] Where else would I go?
[1587.80] I wouldn't know even if you did.
[1595.08] Don't give me that spiteful look.
[1598.32] Can't I joke with my sweetheart anymore?
[1603.56] In this sad pose,
you look like that actress...
[1607.20] Sushmita Sen.
[1608.80] No wait, she's the tall one.
[1611.12] The other, shorter one.
[1614.84] I can't remember her name.
[1616.32] But you look just like her.
[1618.80] Go make tea for me, come on.
[1748.96] It's done.
[1751.00] Ali...
[1753.36] Just a minute, child.
[1758.40] Shammo, leave it, leave it alone.
[1762.00] It's not your job to do.
[1764.64] God has created women for such jobs,
[1767.12] this is not a man's job.
[1768.88] What else can I do, Bay ji?
[1771.12] Oh no.
[1773.36] I have to explain everything, Shammo.
[1776.80] Be a man!
[1778.96] Women never respect
a man who is afraid of them.
[1782.36] - Do you want me to use force-
- I'm implying nothing.
[1785.56] I'm only telling you to be a man with her.
[1791.40] - Listen to me...
- I am listening...
[1794.04] Stupid.
[1796.64] I always let you have your way.
[1799.96] I accepted Umaina for your sake.
[1803.96] I even accepted him
with a lot of difficulties.
[1807.08] Did I or did I not?
[1809.64] Such a nuisance.
[1811.88] Now I want you to do as I say.
[1816.20] You tried being a husband.
[1819.84] Now be a man!
[1848.56] Umi, wake up.
[1850.28] Feed him.  He's hungry.
[1857.08] Come on.
[1860.44] I...
[1865.84] I'm saying something.
[1867.28] You'll feed him now.
[1877.80] What...
[1879.04] Let me go.
[1880.00] I am talking to you.  I've had enough.
[1883.20] You'll feed him now.
[1886.20] What right do you have over me?
[1888.32] I am your husband.
[1889.36] Aren't you ashamed to tell your wife, - to
[1891.12] feed her illegitimate child.
- Umi.
[2025.12] You completely lose your mind.
[2026.80] Out of my way, Shameem.
[2034.84] Take it away.
[2118.40] You wanted me to be a man, didn't you?
[2136.64] I never wanted to be like my father.
[2144.24] Father was proud to be a man!
[2151.84] Whenever he wanted
to show off his manliness,
[2156.40] he would trash Bay ji terribly.
[2162.52] Parts of her body would turn blue,
[2165.20] she would suffer with broken bones.
[2172.92] As long as father was alive,
[2178.56] Bay ji kept praying for his death,
and now, Bay ji
[2185.92] tells me to be a man.
[2190.56] Be a man, son.
[2191.92] Be like your father.
[2203.28] Brother Abdullah's abuses, Khurram's
character, and his cheap actions,
[2211.40] are these signs of manliness?
[2224.60] Rukhsana gives me examples of Abdullah,
[2230.00] and Humaira of Khurram.
[2233.32] Look Shameem, that's a man.
[2240.00] Be a man
[2244.60] And now even you...
[2257.48] Do women desire someone who humiliates them, beats
[2262.84] them?
[2265.04] Treat her like a slave?
[2268.84] Yes?
[2274.96] If these are signs of manliness,
[2276.64] then shame on such men!
[2282.64] I don't want to be a man.
[2287.52] I like the way I am.
[2291.68] I'm better this way.
[2301.36] Are you crying about being a man?
[2308.56] I am a woman.
[2312.20] Am I not forced to be a woman?
[2318.84] Isn't my body given
preference over my skills?
[2325.84] I am asked to endure all the atrocities
which my father did to me.
[2332.80] I was betrayed.
[2335.84] I was deemed characterless.
[2342.16] Why am I not given the
right to choose my love?
[2348.48] See...
[2350.28] She's got such a loud voice,
what manly laughter.
[2354.60] She has an attitude, smokes cigarettes.
[2357.52] Falling in love.
[2363.80] I can't give birth at will or disown him.
[2366.96] I can't even reject him.
Why?
[2375.08] If you're being forced to be a master,
[2379.08] then you're behaving exactly the way
you're being treated.
[2385.00] You don't understand normal people.
[2388.36] You don't want to be like your father.
[2392.08] Even I don't want to be
like Humaira and Rukhsana.
[2400.48] For God's sake, this is not what I wanted.
[2403.28] But you did.
[2405.96] If this is what you want, Shameem,
[2407.44] then I'll comply with you.
[2409.84] I'll look after him,
[2411.88] but only as your property.
[2414.36] But I'll never forget
that he's Bilal's son.
[2417.60] A part of my haunting past
you forced upon me.
