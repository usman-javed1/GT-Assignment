AIDS. An unfortunate disease, which erases its victim's identity. No relative, or status. He's stuck with
a single identity. That he's... ...HIV positive. That's all. Bay ji,
why did you take the trouble? You should've called me. What's wrong? What are you doing, Bay ji? Why are you crying? Come, sit. Sit here. - Forgive me!
- No, Bay ji. Don't embarrass me, Bay ji, please. What are you doing? I didn't know. I didn't know what
a great woman you are. No. You stood by Shameem, even when his mother couldn't. Bay ji,
after what Shameem did for me, I've done nothing. Any other wife
would've done the same. Wives cannot be so strong. Wives cannot be so strong. Only a companion can. You're his true companion. You're his true companion. I need another favour from you. Name it, Bay ji, anything for you. I beg of you Take Shammo and
go someplace far away. Go someplace far away. I have already lost my son. My daughters... People here won't let you live. Die someplace peacefully. Look... Look how unfortunate I am. Look how unfortunate I am. I am telling my child, to leave this house. I am telling my child to leave. As life seemed to fade away, even our memories began to evade us. I know what you're going to tell me. For God's sake, it's not my fault. I tried to stop Khurram. But he's such a stubborn
and vile person, that he told Wajeeha's
in-laws anyway. I tried... Stop blaming yourself. It's not your fault. You're a victim yourself. Tolerating a person like Khurram, living with him needs courage. Uncle was unfair, by marrying his
useless nephew to me. Thinking he would mend
his ways after our marriage. But people like him never change. Come on. Look Humaira, we weren't ready... ...for the trial
life put us through. In fact, no one ever is. But since we're in this, we've to face it now. We'll do something with our lives, but Ali is still very young. He doesn't understand these things. We must save Ali. And only you can help us. Humaira, you don't know how strong you are, and honest too. I've been a witness. I've seen it. And I am sure you'll not just
fulfil yours but the responsibility... ...which we're going to give you. Will you support your brother? Will you be Ali's mother? Oh! It was this way,
that you gave your own, you very own child to someone else. It wasn't an easy decision to make. Handing over the apple of our eye... ...to someone else isn't easy. And only parents can feel this pain. Mrs. Shameem, people often leave
their children in garbage dumps, to save their reputation
or starvation. Or if they are slightly
merciful and don't kill them, they leave them at some orphanage. Even they are parents. Are there ways out like this? Mrs. Shameem,
is fear an eminent emotion, which can overpower
even a mother's love? Maybe you have heard, some random person who can't swim, jumped in the ocean... ...to save his child. You must have. What do you think? Why do you think he did it? Because he wants to carry
this medal of honour with pride? Or... ...with the fear... ...that his child will drown. Wherever we would go
we would only face rejection. Ali was not a bad student. His last year's performance
was pretty good. But he was tagged along with us. AIDS. - Leave me.
- Ali. - Leave me alone, I don't want to go.
- Ali. - Just listen to me.
- I don't want to go. Why don't you want to go? You will have to go. Whether you like it
or not you'll have to go. - Understood.
- Stop it. - Papa, please.
- Come here. Come here.
Listen to me. Look... even mom and dad don't
want you to leave us. Even we are sad. But the schools here are dirty, very bad. We're sending you
to a better school. Because you have AIDS. Everyone's right.
You are the worst parents. What are you doing? What are you doing? Please, papa,
I don't want to stay away from you. Stop it, son, stop crying. Everything will be fine. Thank you very much, madam. We're indebted to you. Very cute boy. Tell me your name. AIDS kid! What was that, Ali? - I want to know what that was?
- I don't want to talk to you. My son, please don't do this. You know how much
pain mom and dad are in? If you send me away again, then I'll do it again. Fine, will it be fine if
mom and dad are dead? Shameem! Shameem! Shameem! What's wrong with you? Shameem! Call someone, son.
Shameem! Oh Lord please, have mercy. Will papa be fine? Yes, papa will be fine. He will be fine when
you wake up in the morning. He'll be home. He'll be fine. Papa, I will do as you say. What? Take your medicines. It wasn't right to
emotionally blackmail Ali. Do you think I enjoyed
emotionally blackmailing him? It was painful for me too. AIDS was quickly
devouring us inside. The signs were everywhere. Inside as well as outside. We realised that doesn't
matter where Ali is, as long as he's connected to us... ...no one will accept us. Except for one person... What are you doing? It's important. Who is it, sweetheart? It's someone I know. Stay inside, don't move. Come this way. Your brother is
crazy and so are you. I've nothing to do with you two. Listen to me, Khurram, I want to adopt Ali
with legal documents. And I cannot do it without you. I don't care who you adopt, keep me away from this mess. Go away. Stop disturbing me. I spent a fortune on the hotel and... Leave. I am doing this for you. For me? Are you adopting him or me? Mother Teresa. Go inside and shut the door.
I'm coming. Listen to me, carefully. You sold brother Shameem's shop, and now you're sitting idle. You never thought that Shameem
has the biggest share in the manor, then we sisters. If we adopt their only son, then who gets the lion's share. Think. I cannot pull this off without you. Oh my my. I never paid attention to this. Humaira, you've become pretty clever I never expected such a clever
idea from a stupid person like you. Humaira, you know I love you always. I know you can do
anything to have me back. I did this out of spite against you. Come on, let's go home. Come on. Come on. Let me carry that. Come on. Adoption papers are ready. Please read it properly and sign it. Here and you sign here. I'll talk to him Sorry, Excuse me! You siblings are so filmy. The drag kind. Such a bore. Shameem. I cannot do it. For Ali's sake. We must do it for Ali's sake. Please. Come on. Congratulations Humaira begum, now you're officially
master Ali's mother. - Oh!
- Oh no! Thank you. Bring your hand forth. No, Umi will do it. You leave it. - Let her spend time with Ali.
- Leave it. I said Umi... Six! Take it back. Please! Please! Please! Now... Oh shoot,
I should have placed it behind. Come on. Wash your hands. It's done. Every child has some
complaint with his parents. Some more others less. But everyone does. Ali does too? He may have too. It's not easy for the
child to understand... ...their parent's decision
and their behaviour. My father couldn't
express his emotions. He was a man. How could he show his weaknesses? Whereas it was his biggest weakness. I always had this
one complaint with him. And now, he gave me his love along
with regret before he died. Now I wish I could've spent... ...some more time with him. You forgave him, even after everything he did to you? You did a big favour to him. I did a favour to myself. I was carrying a
huge burden on my heart. Finally, I set myself free. And when he realised his mistake, there was nothing to
stop me from doing the same. My father is not like that. He will never realise. Fatima. Parents are a big blessing. Ask those who have none. Don't be angry with
them for too long. They are not around for too long. And it's very painful... ...when they are not around. Do a favour not on them,
but yourself. Forgive brother Abdullah. He will never realise. You can try. Why take the trouble? I could've come over. You took the consignment
back without saying a word. When I checked the
consignment again, I noticed faults in it. I said not to worry,
I'll keep these. I'll send you a fresh stock. Brother Abdullah,
you're a very honest man. I am very impressed. You were amazing. What did I do? Any honest
person would act the same way. You're buying back the
stock at the original price. You are at a loss
by making me a profit. You're not an ordinary person,
Abdullah. You're very special. Maybe, but a lot
of people don't agree. Who are you talking about? No one. What were you saying? Brother Abdullah,
there is something I want to say. Go on. You said you have a daughter. I want to come to your house. Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Your parents are your god,
never speak ill of them! Ali... say it, child. You'll call her mama
and not Humaira aunty. Why? Because if you don't call her mom
then they won't allow you in school. But she's my aunt and not my mom. I am telling you. Why don't you understand? You won't call her Humaira aunty, you'll call her mom. Understood. Ali... Ali... Yes, mom. Son, you didn't answer her question. She's asking you something. Doesn't matter.
Children often become nervous. It's okay. Did you fill the quiz? Show me, son. Your son is very intelligent. Bravo. But he has missed half of his term, but let me consider. Will he get admission? Yes, don't worry. Thank you very much. Now this. First right then left. Look at me. Look at you. Come on.
We're getting late for school. No parent would want to
stay away from their children. She doesn't enjoy making you suffer. She does it to annoy you. Because when you're not around... ...she prays as well as seeks repentance. I don't know where
I went wrong in life. I was never dishonest with my work. Then why me? I always respected you,
and this family. Respect? If you wanted respect, then
you should've given respect first. You only taught her to fear you. Not love you. Your love, your affection... Doesn't a daughter deserve
her father's affection? I've always seen that
daughters have to kneel. I've tasted the consequences. What did I get except
for embarrassment? You're responsible
for everything she's doing. What do you think I like
seeing her in this condition? Watching her punish
herself like this? If you want to do any good to her, then do as I say. She thinks I am a monster, but she will listen to you. Tell her to get married. I don't care if she
never acknowledges us again. Get married and settle down. I'll talk to her. Brother Abdullah, do you want tea? No. Brother Abdullah, I want to give you something,
for safekeeping. I know that... ...you don't like me, but I know you're an honest person. I won't be a part
of any of your sins. You know that, right? No, it's not what you think. I came to give you the
papers to the manor and shops. Before I go I want to
give you this responsibility. And finally, the day arrived, when after handing over
our responsibilities... ...we wanted to erase our existence. Like... ...we never existed. We're leaving, Bay ji. Who is it? It's me, mom. What happened, Ali? I am scared. What happened? Can I sleep here, mom? Go sleep with mom. I want to sleep with you. Please, mom, please, dad. We decided we'll not
meet Ali when we leave. We'll get emotional. Shameem, look at me. Come. Stay with papa.
