[30.32] All right, Mr Shehzad,
I will do something,
[34.84] I’ll get back to you very soon.
[38.96] Thank you.
[72.48] I never thought anyone 
could stoop so low.
[99.80] Whatever is happening 
or has happened,
[105.56] it first made me weak
[118.64] but ever since all my ideas 
have turned out to be wrong,
[123.92] I don’t have any regrets at all,
[137.20] and I am not weak either.
[147.24] I have decided,
[150.64] I will face every situation,
[163.36] I will fight everything.
[167.32] Look, Arooj, I like your confidence
[169.32] but doing all this won’t be this easy.
[172.28] Hmm,
[174.04] I know
[182.76] it is difficult,
[185.80] in fact, maybe very difficult,
[197.20] but what is the worst 
that can happen?
[200.76] I will lose
[212.08] but I will fight the situation for sure.
[239.08] Anyway,
[241.24] I called you here at this time,
[249.96] Shanzey, I need your help.
[253.48] Sure, Arooj, tell me.
[267.36] Brother Nasir’s company 
is in danger,
[277.84] and all of this is happening
 because of me,
[289.08] if you can ask your uncle and 
get some tenders for this company,
[293.64] it would be a great help for me.
[304.36] Brother Nasir has decided, Shanzey,
[315.40] but the situation of the company 
that I see,
[321.04] I feel we will have to downsize,
[327.72] a lot of people will be unemployed
[338.20] just because of me.
[340.64] Okay, don’t worry,
[342.68] I will do something, 
don’t worry, yeah?
[347.84] Thank you.
[349.96] And why are you being 
so formal to me?
[356.52] Will you have tea or coffee?
[358.96] Coffee.
[364.40] Hello,
[366.28] send 2 coffees,
[368.24] thank you.
[394.80] I have found out through 
the management that
[398.16] Salman has ended all his tenders.
[403.52] Unfortunately,
[405.52] that’s how it is, sister in law.
[407.20] And all this is because of me,
[411.40] do you know brother Nasir,
[414.84] Salman owns 70% tenders 
of this company?
[422.92] And if these tenders are over, 
the company will finish.
[431.92] Why are you making this deal 
of a loss because of me?
[434.88] Sister in law, that seems like 
a loss to you,
[438.92] that’s actually not a loss.
[444.24] And trust me, 
I am very content that
[446.56] at least I didn’t take anyone’s
 lawful right
[453.44] and sister in law, tenders keep 
on coming and going,
[455.88] don’t worry at all.
[505.44] Yes, coming.
[510.56] Greetings.
[511.88] Greetings.
[514.48] Is this Arooj’s house?
[517.76] Yes but who are you?
[521.48] You won’t be able to get 
who I am.
[529.92] I want to meet Arooj.
[533.28] Arooj is not home, 
she has gone to the office.
[537.48] office?
[544.12] No problem, 
I will wait for her.
[554.04] Hey, Arooj is here. 
Greetings.
[562.32] Greetings,
[565.96] you?
[568.12] Umm, actually I wanted 
to talk about something.
[588.92] Come.
[693.36] Come in.
[698.44] Have a seat, please.
[715.24] Your Mom looked very nervous,
[718.68] she wasn’t even letting me in.
[736.04] Yes,
[738.52] now the situation of life has 
turned the way
[742.16] that we are scared of everything.
[755.84] You tell me, what brings you here?
[772.00] I…
[783.28] I am here to apologize to you.
[794.68] Apologize?
[802.84] Apologize for what?
[814.84] You were my well-wisher,
[827.96] but I was unable to judge you.
[843.84] I changed my address because 
Idrees asked me to,
[856.32] I cut out contact with you,
[866.72] I made a mistake in recognizing you
[877.08] though you wanted good for me.
[881.24] No problem,
[887.64] you did what you thought was 
right at that time,
[905.32] but that wasn’t just good for you
[908.08] but for all of us.
[913.20] I had no idea that
[922.20] Idrees would change so soon.
[934.16] His tomorrow never came for 
which I wasted all my life.
[954.08] But
[957.16] now even I am out of the way,
[966.20] and Uncle Idrees has successfully 
betrayed Aunt Shaista as well,
[985.76] why is he doing this to you now?
[997.80] Greed.
[1007.40] Idrees has become greedy.
[1017.60] He is very sure of the fact that
[1019.84] he is the sole owner of the entire 
property now.
[1032.88] He would just give me 
run-around earlier
[1035.20] but now,
[1042.80] he looks me straight in the eyes 
and says it
[1051.00] but I have decided as well,
[1054.36] I won’t let Idrees do 
what he wants so easily.
[1070.24] Arooj,
[1072.68] I want to apologize to you
 for the mistake I made,
[1090.68] I want to help you now,
[1103.52] you must stand in front of Idrees
 for your right
[1116.40] and I will help you in every step 
that you need me.
[1126.80] Thank you so much for your love,
[1137.28] but now I don’t need any help 
from you
[1154.92] because I want to fight 
this battle myself now.
[1171.96] I wish,
[1174.64] I wish you would have supported me
 at that time,
[1187.04] then you wouldn’t be sitting here
in front of me as well
[1196.20] and me and my family wouldn’t be
going through the hell
[1199.92] we are going at the moment.
[1205.48] I am actually very embarrassed.
[1222.16] What had to happen, it did,
[1239.40] now if you can do something,
[1242.80] just pray for me.
[1256.72] Sure, why not?
[1264.44] I will go and check on Mom, 
she was making tea for you.
[1266.44] Know, know, just allow me
to leave now,
[1269.44] I shall leave.
[1271.64] As you wish. 
Come.
[1356.88] Thank you so much, Arooj,
[1362.24] you heard me and 
gave me respect.
[1365.56] Hey, don’t embarrass me 
by saying all this,
[1372.44] I pray that you get 
your lawful right.
[1376.84] Amen.
[1378.56] You can come to my house 
whenever you need me.
[1383.96] Thank you so much.
[1387.08] Bye. 
Bye.
[1448.92] So this is your Islamabad, Mr Idrees?
[1458.76] You have been living here 
in this Karachi
[1462.60] and I am destroyed 
in the same city.
[1472.56] Idrees, who is this woman?
[1477.64] I am asking you,
[1479.64] who is she and what rubbish 
is she talking?
[1485.84] Idrees doesn’t have any other lie 
to tell now.
[1494.60] I will tell you,
[1498.76] I am Idrees’ wife.
[1509.68] Idrees, what is she saying?
[1512.36] Answer me, she is talking 
about marriage.
[1517.20] Hey, I don’t know 
who is this woman.
[1520.28] Really?
[1521.80] So you won’t even recognize 
your son
[1527.44] and not even this ring.
[1534.32] Hey enough now, you have been 
constantly talking,
[1536.88] don’t you have any manners of 
what’s right and wrong?
[1538.84] Shaista, I don’t know what is 
she saying. I don’t know.
[1547.40] I will lie about such a huge thing?
Such a huge thing?
[1552.92] Okay enough, one second,
[1555.60] one second.
[1561.04] Do you have any proof of this allegation 
that you are imposing?
[1636.84] Come in.
[1640.36] Madam?
[1642.40] What happened?
[1643.44] Madam, there is someone woman 
who has come to meet you.
[1646.76] Some woman? Who is she?
[1649.68] I don’t know I have seen her 
for the first time.
[1653.80] Did she tell you nay name?
[1656.20] Yes, her name is Musarrat.
[1660.24] Okay, make her sit there, 
I am coming.
[1673.08] That marriage certificate is false,
why are you worried?
[1675.60] It's a false marriage certificate.
I am not worried,
[1678.00] try to understand 
what I am saying.
[1682.16] I am not amongst those wives
[1687.28] who will see their husband 
with other woman
[1691.76] and will start crying and whining,
[1696.36] I have a grown-up son,
[1698.72] he will take care of all 
these matters now.
[1703.08] Umm Salman?
[1706.48] Why are you dragging Salman
into all this,
[1708.64] he has to look after a lot 
of business matters.
[1711.76] Why are you panicking?
[1715.12] You just said that woman is a liar.
[1718.64] Yes, yes, she…
[1720.44] So let’s see,
[1723.00] Salman is coming back
from the office.
[1729.88] Just pray that woman proves
to be a liar.
[1746.68] When you went to work,
[1749.16] a woman came right after it
[1751.04] and said that 
she is his second wife.
[1753.72] She was lying, lying.
[1759.40] I don’t know
[1760.84] if she was telling the truth or lie
[1763.36] but she even had a 
marriage certificate.
[1765.60] I am telling you it was fake.
[1769.12] May I complete my sentence?
[1771.76] My honor is at stake and you are about
finishing what you were saying,
[1776.60] I have told you that I can never be terms 
with other woman when you are here
[1782.52] and you listened to her?
[1785.84] If she was honest, she would 
have been sitting.
[1789.76] No matter if she was honest or a liar
but why did she come here?
[1797.48] Only Arooj can tell that.
[1874.28] Why did you stand?
[1877.44] Sit down.
[1885.28] I didn’t ask you to leave.
[1889.84] You just don’t worry,
[1902.72] I haven’t come here to go back.
[1910.20] So that means you will get 
insulted and then go?
[1918.36] Who will get humiliated here,
[1926.48] you font have that authority.
[1930.88] Don’t talk rubbish,
[1940.76] come to the point that 
you are hear for.
[1945.48] I don’t want to talk to you at all.
[1955.96] You cannot do anything for me.
[1959.24] What do you mean?
[1962.12] You are being betrayed like me.
[1972.00] both of us have been betrayed 
by the same man?
[1985.72] It’s just that the problem is you 
don’t want to accept betrayal.
[2001.84] You are the one betraying
[2010.28] by lying you are Idree’s Wife,
[2020.52] you are doing all this drama.
[2023.88] That is the truth I have come 
here to tell.
