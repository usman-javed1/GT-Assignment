[45.60] Hello
[47.00] How are you, Salman?
[50.04] I am fine,
[51.28] how are you, Basit?
[53.56] The thing to tell is,
[55.92] the shooter who attacked you,
[59.16] we have traced him.
[67.40] We raided him 
but he escaped.
[72.48] So what is the point of 
telling all of this?
[74.72] This is not as simple as 
you are thinking it to be, Salman.
[82.60] Those boys are hired hitters
[85.72] and they have a criminal record.
[89.80] What do you mean?
[91.00] It means someone else is your enemy,
[97.00] who gave them money to kill you.
[103.04] Now you tell me,
[105.36] whom do you doubt it to be?
[108.48] So that I can catch them,
[110.28] otherwise there can be another 
attack on you.
[114.08] Yes, but I have no enmity 
with anyone,
[118.16] then who could it be?
[122.16] Anyway,
[123.84] you should carry on 
with your inquiry.
[125.96] By the way, Salman, 
my experience tells me
[129.48] that the one who called this attack
on you is someone close to you,
[144.96] who knew that 
we were about to raid.
[148.64] Someone informed them on time
[150.88] and they escaped.
[153.28] When you can catch the shooters,
 see who was behind it,
[157.12] and inform me as well.
[158.84] Okay, I will inform you.
[260.92] Wasai!
[263.48] Wasai!
[264.92] Yes, coming Young Madam.
[267.44] Wasai, where is Mom?
[269.00] She must be in her room.
[270.56] She is not in her room!
[272.60] Do one thing, 
you look in the store,
[274.68] I will check the lawn.
Yes.
[301.76] Elder Madam!
[303.88] Elder Madam!
[306.04] Young Madam!
[308.08] Young Madam!
[312.20] Mom,
[314.80] Mom!
[316.28] Mom!
[317.36] Mom!
[320.08] Mom, open your eyes, Mom!
[321.88] Mom, what happened?
[323.08] Wasai, bring water, 
go quickly!
[326.00] Mom!
[327.52] Mom, open your eyes.
[329.36] Mom, what happened?
[331.28] Wasai! Wasai, 
come quickly.
[334.68] Mom!
[350.72] Whatever you told me about her,
[353.44] how her memory is coming back, 
it is really amazing!
[357.84] She is remembering her past,
[361.08] without any mental damage,
[363.96] this rarely happens.
[366.28] But Doctor,
[368.20] she is getting weaker day by day.
[372.40] She gets sudden headaches
[375.44] and they are so severe, 
that I get scared.
[378.84] The cells were inactive 
for a long time.
[384.68] It takes time,
[386.40] and one experiences shocks as well.
[389.28] Okay,
[390.68] it means you're saying her memory
 is coming back.
[396.16] Then, Doctor, how much time 
will it take
[398.92] for her memory to recover 
completely?
[401.76] It’s in front of you.
[403.20] Nothing happened in years.
[410.60] She is getting better. 
Hope for the best.
[414.92] Yes,
[416.60] I have hope for the best,
[423.36] I just want to keep my mother happy.
[431.48] She has faced a lot of traumas,
[434.84] I want to see her happy.
[436.96] You take care of her. 
Everything will get better.
[443.52] I will take my leave now.
[525.12] Salman, son!
[534.36] Salman, son, 
where were you?
[557.20] I have been calling you 
for a while,
[559.32] you were not picking up your phone,
I got so worried.
[562.04] There is no need for you 
to get worried.
[565.84] How are you talking to me?
[571.08] I am not a child,
[573.40] that will get lost.
[584.56] You answer me,
[590.68] am I a weak child that someone 
will hand over to somebody else
[593.68] and be unconcerned about it?
[595.56] No, no. No, no, child.
[601.96] I know what you are trying to say,
[610.00] but I was never unconcerned 
about you!
[613.24] Stop it!
[627.84] Don't say anything else.
[641.24] If this is not called being unconcerned,
then what else do we call it?
[679.08] What are you looking 
at over there?
[687.32] Salman went away.
[691.88] He didn’t go anywhere,
[694.76] he got a huge mental shock, 
he will come back.
[698.84] He will not come back,
[707.48] and this is karma.
[710.28] What do you mean, huh? 
What are you trying to say?
[715.04] You separated me from my Mom,
[724.92] today your own son left you!
[730.00] No,
[731.56] my son is in front of me.
[734.12] Yes, he is in front of you
[737.96] and you want to hug him as well,
[747.16] but he doesn’t even want 
to see your face!
[765.12] I will handle all of that.
[776.72] What are you being 
so happy about, huh?
[780.04] Because it is my turn 
to be happy now.
[798.64] Arooj!
[815.64] My son,
[818.80] he is going through so much pain!
[821.76] Everything will be fine.
[824.80] How will it get better?
[829.04] I am telling you,
[830.32] one day I will burst out,
[835.88] my patience is wearing thin!
[839.52] Then go, go and tell him!
[844.52] Imagine, when Salman 
comes to know
[847.12] that you are his real mother, 
he will start hating you so much,
[853.48] that you gave him away to Mehreen,
[856.64] just for money!
[861.56] Not for money,
[864.12] but to save Mehreen’s life.
[873.48] Fool everyone,
[875.80] but not me and yourself, Shaista.
[884.24] There are two enemies of us,
in our home.
[888.72] One is Arooj
[890.88] and the other is Mehreen.
[896.32] Now, we should do this,
[897.72] we should tell Mehreen that 
Salman is not hers but our son.
[904.88] What will happen from all of this?
[906.56] She will go mad from the shock.
[911.76] But our target is Arooj,
[913.64] who has the entire business 
in her name.
[915.84] It is necessary to defeat Arooj’s luck.
[919.44] We don’t have time.
[923.24] That’s why we will have 
to change the plan.
[926.00] No, no, think of something else.
[929.12] And keep in mind that 
the wind is against us,
[932.16] any carelessness will throw us 
to a new place.
[939.08] Remember this.
[1033.40] Oh,
[1035.00] why did you come?
[1037.24] You were told to rest.
[1040.20] I am fine,
[1042.36] Salman didn’t come back yet?
[1044.12] Yes…
[1056.20] You have a long life,
[1088.64] what happened Salman, Son?
[1090.28] Don’t call me your ‘son’!
[1108.76] Salman, lower your voice,
[1110.48] she is your mom.
Quiet!
[1124.80] No one will speak,
[1134.60] especially not a lie!
[1146.72] I have come to know 
about everything.
[1160.88] I have seen my birth certificate.
[1164.92] It must be wrong.
[1167.52] Nothing is wrong,
[1171.56] it was not a lie.
[1187.96] The lie is, what has been shown 
to me as the truth for so many years!
[1208.92] I am telling you,
[1218.12] I am not your son,
[1232.96] nor you’re my mom!
[1245.40] Never call me your son ever again.
[1297.00] He was lying right?
[1301.64] He,
[1307.40] has he gone mad?
[1310.28] He was saying that 
I am not his mother!
[1323.76] He is lying,
[1325.48] he is absolutely lying!
[1332.96] Stupid boy!
[1336.68] Idiot,
[1338.92] I am not his mom?
[1377.24] This is the truth,
[1404.36] and it is just half of the truth.
[1418.16] I will show you the whole truth.
[1436.04] Everyone is going mad!
[1438.48] Everyone has gone mad,
[1441.28] he is not my son?
[1474.04] Greetings.
[1475.40] Greetings,
[1477.20] where is my son going all dressed up?
[1481.12] Let me shower you with love quickly,
[1485.32] otherwise, if Mehreen sees it 
then she will raise hell.
[1489.60] Hardly anyone on earth would 
have a mother like mine.
[1495.92] The home has become so lively 
since your bride arrived.
[1501.64] Before she came, there used to be 
a weird silence in this house.
[1505.92] I was just going to get that life.
[1508.00] Really?
[1509.12] Then quickly go and come back.
[1512.60] Goodbye.
Goodbye.
[1521.92] Salman, Oh God,
[1524.24] what happened to my son?
 Are you alright?
[1526.76] Salman is not your son, 
he is my son!
[1530.80] Salman, did something happen
to you? Are you alright?
[1534.48] I am fine, Mom.
[1536.36] Thank you, God!
[1540.16] There is no need for you to worry
this much about Salman,
[1545.76] stop it for God’s sake.
[1547.92] What did I say wrong?
[1549.60] I just called him ‘Son’
[1551.48] It is wrong for someone else to 
call Salman ‘son’, except me.
[1554.36] For God’s sake, please.
[1557.08] Stop it.
[1559.24] Both of you are always 
arguing about me!
[1564.20] Salman
Mom, please,
[1566.52] I am already very late,
I have to go.
[1582.40] Oh, dear God!
[1683.40] What is this?
[1920.40] I am...
[1926.52] your daughter,
[1931.20] Areej.
[2039.68] Here! Look mom.
[2046.80] Areej!
[2048.40] It is so pretty, Mehreen, look.
[2054.00] It is a very pretty name.
[2056.92] So, you gave her a name 
of your liking, right?
[2059.84] Yes,
[2061.40] because Areej is a very pretty name.
[2063.84] Right, Mom?
[2065.12] Yes, it is a very pretty name.
[2068.68] Now our entire home will 
smell of her scent.
[2076.32] Here you go Mom,
[2077.48] make Areej wear it 
with your own hands.
[2079.84] I will remove it.
[2082.76] My little doll.
[2084.72] Here you go.
