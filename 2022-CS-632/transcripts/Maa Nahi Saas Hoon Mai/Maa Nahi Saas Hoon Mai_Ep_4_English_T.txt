[27.20] Yes, sir.
[28.36] Okay. Okay.
[30.84] Miss Nousheen.
[70.52] Yes, sir. Okay, sir.
[76.96] Miss Urooj,
[79.04] you have your interview. Please.
[97.84] Hey, Mr. Salman, you?
[100.36] Why are you standing here?
[101.36] Come inside.
[102.72] What is going on?
[103.80] We are having job interviews.
[107.20] Should I inform Mr. Nasir?
[108.76] No,
[110.20] there is no need for that.
[112.56] Okay, sir.
[172.60] Wow. Wow. Wow.
[174.08] Mr. Salman is in our office
 early in the morning.
[179.52] Wow.
[181.80] What happened?
 Did you talk to her?
[186.96] By the way, it is such
 a beautiful coincidence.
[194.80] This was not a coincidence.
[199.16] I was sure she would come.
[202.28] Coincidence is what has
 happened right now.
[204.60] What happened now?
[206.64] What was the name of the girl who
 just gave an interview and went.
[209.92] Urooj.
[214.60] Urooj Shoaib. 
That was her name.
[220.92] Urooj.
[225.16] Was this the same girl?
[229.60] Yes.
[237.64] This was the same girl.
[243.56] By the way, how was her interview?
[246.88] So-so,
[248.00] but she wasn’t fulfilling the 
company’s requirement.
[253.32] So I rejected her.
[258.84] What do you mean you rejected her?
[261.24] Are you crazy?
[262.92] You rejected such a pretty girl.
[266.40] Oh hello,
[268.92] my dear friend Salman Waqar.
[271.96] This company doesn’t need
 pretty and beautiful girls.
[275.88] It needs intelligent and skillful girls,
[278.84] and after all
[279.96] I have already hired a
 candidate for this post.
[285.12] But,
[287.72] this girl…what was her name?
[290.28] Urooj.
[291.52] She is very, very, educated and 
very sincere to her work.
[295.68] But I am sorry.
[298.56] You call Urooj tomorrow.
[300.96] I am telling you,
[302.60] if you hire Urooj,
[303.76] your company will touch new heights.
[305.68] Call her tomorrow.
[309.60] Okay, I will call her, but 
I have a condition.
[314.12] Tell me your condition.
[316.08] You will interview her,
[318.48] and you will get her appointment
 letter made as well.
[321.44] Done. I am in.
[323.76] You call this girl tomorrow
[325.00] and prepare her appointment
 letter. Alright?
[328.72] Yeah, alright.
[343.72] Urooj.
[358.80] Someday, my patience will run out.
[363.60] It will be your stupidity.
[365.80] If you break down after 
waiting for so long,
[368.44] then what did you get?
[370.00] Think about it.
[375.32] Fine.
[378.28] I will take care of my patience,
[382.36] but I am a mother.
[385.68] How long will I stop myself?
[390.36] I am afraid, Idrees.
[393.56] I just know that if something 
like this happens,
[396.96] then everything will be useless.
[399.56] Mehreen instigates me.
[402.48] Her behavior tortures me.
[407.76] She doesn’t let me go around Salman,
[413.60] and then she calls him her son.
[420.16] As much as she knows, 
as much as she understands,
[422.32] she is right by that perspective.
[425.56] She is right?
[430.96] My motherhood got 
killed for no reason.
[437.00] You should have thought about this, 
when it was time to decide.
[440.20] Now the arrow has left the bow.
[442.16] It has not been pulled 
out of my chest.
[443.84] Then take it out.
[445.56] Think, understand, after that
do what you want.
[450.00] No,
[453.24] you cannot get rid of what 
I said by saying this.
[459.04] That decision wasn’t
 just mine, alone.
[464.64] You too were with me in 
agreeing to mama’s decision.
[471.16] Shahista, I am still standing strong.
[478.76] It is useless to talk to you.
[519.72] Leave his collar.
[521.60] Are you leaving it or not?
[524.36] Leave it. Leave it.
[526.68] Leave it. Leave it.
[586.12] Alright, Miss Urooj Shoaib,
[588.92] I will meet you tomorrow.
[607.00] Greetings.
[608.08] Greetings.
[609.12] Urooj Shoaib.
[610.80] Yes, yes,
[611.60] sir is waiting for you.
[613.44] Thank you.
[630.48] Come in.
[638.92] Good morning sir.
[642.56] Good morning.
[644.92] How are you?
[646.20] Yes, I am fine.
[648.92] Have a seat.
[650.56] Thank you.
[655.96] There was some other sir yesterday,
[658.16] who took my interview.
[661.84] But you can see this file of mine.
[678.64] There is no need for that.
[687.76] You?
[690.56] Yes, me.
[698.52] You can join the office from tomorrow.
[705.00] But till yesterday, I was refused,
[708.20] what happened suddenly?
[711.08] Yes, we had appointed a girl,
[714.12] but I think you deserve this job.
[717.72] So you fired that girl before you hired her.
[722.08] Exactly.
[724.16] That’s why I called you.
[732.28] Thanks.
[735.12] But I am not interested in this job at all.
[739.28] I think the girl you people
 had selected earlier,
[742.32] she deserves this job.
[747.00] You will not decide that, we will.
[752.92] That who we have to hire
[754.92] and who we don’t have to hire.
[761.24] and I too have this complete right,
[763.96] that I can decide
[765.16] where I want to do a job,
[766.28] and where I don’t want to do a job.
[769.40] Had I known you 
would be present here,
[772.48] then I would never have come.
[778.64] I think you didn’t forget the
 incident from that day.
[782.72] I don’t forget such incidents.
[785.80] And people like you
[787.84] who don’t considers humans, human.
[790.24] You trample people in 
your pride and ego.
[798.76] This is wrong.
[803.72] How can you judge my personality
 with the incident that day?
[810.20] Not good.
[815.44] I am getting this job on your 
recommendation.
[819.44] No, there is nothing like that.
[824.52] This is not the truth?
[827.44] If I deserved this job,
[829.92] then I would have been 
appointed yesterday.
[833.04] Fine, then,
[837.56] you got this job because of me.
[840.40] There you go.
[843.32] You know, mister,
[845.60] this is your basic issue,
[849.40] you want to do what you want.
[853.52] Take that day’s incident for example.
[855.60] You hit the guy on the motorcycle a lot.
[857.80] Why?
[858.64] Because he came in your way
[860.32] and you were in a hurry to go.
[862.84] And today,
[864.40] you fired a girl from the job,
[866.80] because you want that I do this job.
[872.36] You are such a shameless man.
[879.08] I am sorry,
[881.00] I don’t like doing a job
 with such people.
[931.00] and I too have this complete right,
[933.48] that I can decide
[934.96] where I want to do a job,
[936.12] and where I don’t want to do a job.
[938.44] Had I known you 
would be present here,
[941.56] then I would never have come.
[959.48] I think you didn’t forget the
 incident from that day.
[963.64] I don’t forget such incidents.
[966.68] And people like you
[968.72] who don’t considers humans, human.
[971.20] You trample people in
 your pride and ego.
[980.00] Wow.
[982.56] So much attitude in front of Salman,
[985.56] this demeanor.
[988.44] Wow, what an attitude.
[992.04] How is this fearlessness of yours 
possible in front of me?
[999.16] I need to answer,
[1002.96] and an answer will be given.
[1038.96] What are you looking at, child?
[1047.24] That’s it,
[1048.40] you have worked enough.
[1049.92] As soon as I find a job,
[1051.80] you take a retirement.
[1055.60] If I sit at home,
[1057.52] then I will fall ill.
[1059.60] Then who will take care of 
the matters of the school?
[1064.24] The one who comes in your place, 
will take care of it.
[1069.16] Okay, you tell me,
[1071.20] how was the interview?
[1075.84] Interview?
[1079.40] Actually, papa, I didn’t like that job.
[1084.40] Really child?
[1085.72] The job too is as per your liking?
[1088.68] Like your clothes and shoes.
[1091.88] Why do I feel I am getting insulted?
[1095.44] No, not at all.
[1097.28] This is an allegation.
[1103.72] Both the father and daughter are
 enjoying some special topic.
[1107.84] Yes.
[1109.32] The daughter didn’t like the job,
[1111.76] so she quit it and came.
[1115.72] It is fine, no issues.
[1118.76] I will find a job that I will for 
and that I like, you will see.
[1124.48] Come on, I have cooked 
your favourite food,
[1127.28] come on.
[1127.76] Let’s go!
[1174.52] You  know about me.
[1176.72] I am unable to tolerate 
something wrong at all.
[1179.40] Urooj,
[1180.36] you have to tolerate the wrong thing,
[1182.28] or else what is the point of 
tolerating the right thing.
[1186.04] What does this mean?
[1189.20] I mean, you yourself were saying 
he is really handsome.
[1192.16] Look,
[1192.96] you shouldn’t have done this with him.
[1197.20] Aren’t you talking a bit too much?
[1199.00] And you are really favouring him.
[1201.60] Eat quietly.
[1205.60] The food is good, you know.
[1207.16] Between us,
[1208.16] it is really delicious.
[1209.04] Listen,
[1210.32] I will ask for the bill.
[1212.40] He will bring the bill till we finish food.
[1214.36] Hmmm.
[1216.16] Excuse me.
[1219.32] Yes, madam.
[1221.36] Bring our bill.
[1223.12] Bring it in a little while.
[1224.68] Your bill has been paid, madam.
[1231.48] It has been paid?
[1234.08] Who paid it?
[1235.00] That sir paid your bill.
[1244.32] He has come here after me as well.
[1246.24] I will not leave him today.
[1249.92] How much was our bill?
[1251.16] Eighteen hundred.
[1253.12] Fine, thank you.
[1255.72] Now you see, what I do with him.
[1257.08] Not right now.
[1258.12] What is the need right now?
[1269.40] Mister,
[1271.64] why did you pay my bill?
[1273.84] Who are you?
[1278.60] Look, whatever happened
 that day wasn’t right.
[1282.00] I am sorry for that.
[1283.68] You come, have a seat, we will talk.
[1285.20] Look, you said sorry,
[1286.84] I accepted your sorry.
[1290.00] Now you don’t try to be 
too frank, okay?
[1305.96] Your bill.
[1314.48] And keep the change.
[1323.96] Come on, Shanzay.
[1325.00] Man, let me finish food. 
I am really hungry.
[1328.08] I have eaten all that 
I had to. I am going.
[1330.20] You eat.
[1330.84] Okay, wait.
[1349.24] I had a lot of fun today.
[1350.28] Right?
[1351.16] Fine, you leave then.
[1352.44] Okay then, take lots of 
care of yourself.
[1354.44] We will meet again.
[1355.20] Okay, goodbye.
[1367.32] Urooj.
[1374.04] Whatever happened there,
[1376.56] I apologize to you for it once again.
[1380.04] It was my mistake,
[1381.68] I am really embarrassed about it.
[1384.88] So I told you that I forgave you.
[1388.08] Your sorry is done. Now?
[1392.08] Look,
[1393.96] I am not such a person. 
Not at all.
[1396.08] I am not interested in this,
[1397.88] if you are this type of person,
 that type person,
[1399.84] whatever type of person.
[1402.52] And even now you are doing wrong.
[1409.24] What is wrong in this?
[1412.12] You follow me like this again and again,
[1415.76] this is really insulting for me.
[1457.84] Whenever I see her,
[1460.72] I feel I am looking at myself.
[1466.00] She is even more stubborn than me.
[1472.68] By the way, I had asked 
you to do something,
[1474.72] did you do it?
[1476.52] What work has not been done?
[1478.60] Who is Urooj? Where does she live?
[1480.20] Who is her family?
[1481.44] You didn’t tell me till now.
[1482.96] I have found out.
[1486.00] Here you go.
[1487.60] This has all the information.
[1491.88] Well done. Thank you so much.
[1495.20] I didn’t understand one thing,
[1497.96] what will you do with this information?
[1500.80] I mean,
[1504.08] such a big businessman 
of this city is going
[1507.52] so crazy after such an ordinary girl.
[1511.60] I mean why?
[1514.76] She is not an ordinary girl.
[1521.64] The one who stops Salman’s hand,
[1525.76] how can she be ordinary?
[1566.52] What are you doing?
[1568.04] Sit. Sit. Sit.
[1572.28] Child, after trying a lot,
[1575.36] my dream is going to be fulfilled.
[1578.52] What dream?
[1580.16] You know, Urooj,
[1583.68] I want to make a computer 
lab in the school.
[1587.28] Yes,
[1588.16] and for this you are always trying.
[1591.60] So think that the time for it has come.
[1598.00] The arrangements are being 
made to make a computer lab.
[1600.84] Oh wow, papa. Honestly?
[1603.88] This is really good.
[1606.12] But how did this happen?
[1609.04] I had made an appeal for help on 
our school’s social media page,
[1614.96] so some people contacted
 us themselves.
[1618.48] Papa, this is really good.
[1621.44] But I will tell you something,
[1623.04] I don’t have money,
[1624.64] I will not give you a donation.
[1626.52] Yes, if there is something else,
 then tell me,
[1628.44] I will do that.
[1629.44] I will.
[1631.48] Without you, no work of 
mine is complete.
[1637.72] And as far as the 
donation is concerned,
[1640.60] you are the biggest donation of my life.
[1644.24] When you are with me,
[1645.88] I have everything.
[1649.88] You are not my daughter,
[1652.00] you are my son.
[1655.48] Thank you, papa.
[1659.68] Look at this.
[1685.48] It is necessary to tell the 
guests here today,
[1689.20] that this function today is
[1690.68] because of an old wish of this 
schools head master, Mr. Shoaib.
[1696.16] He always wanted that
[1698.08] there should be a computer
 lab in this school.
[1700.80] But still even after trying hard,
[1703.08] the money couldn’t be arranged.
[1705.68] But today,
[1707.72] by the grace of God, this 
effort of his has been fulfilled.
[1712.92] The respectable businessman 
and builder of the city,
[1716.76] Salman Waqar,
[1718.80] has promised that
[1720.48] he will provide funds to build 
a computer lab in the school
[1725.64] and he will be with us in a little while,
[1729.48] and I wish that welcome him well.
[1749.08] Welcome, sir.
[1751.32] Thank you so much.
[1753.56] Come on, sir. Come.
[1769.84] Ladies and gentlemen,
[1771.20] please welcome Mr. Salman Waqar,
[1773.96] who is headed this way.
[1816.48] Thank you so much everyone 
for having me over here.
[1822.12] Firstly, I want to say that
[1825.60] I was not like this earlier.
[1829.68] I was really stubborn
[1831.56] and short tempered.
[1834.12] I would stay lost in my own world.
[1838.52] I didn’t care about anyone’s 
sorrow and pain.
[1844.20] But then someone came in my life,
[1848.20] they made me realize that
[1851.20] life is not what I used to think.
[1855.00] In fact, life is really different.
[1859.20] She introduced me to the colours of life.
[1864.64] She changed my thinking
[1868.64] and today, whatever I am doing
[1871.12] is my first step towards
my changing thinking.
[1880.24] And today on this occasion,
[1882.60] I just want to say to that person, that,
[1888.80] thanks
[1892.20] for coming in my life
[1895.24] and making my life beautiful.
[1900.60] Thank you so much, everyone.
[1906.72] Mr. Salman, come on.
[1907.96] No thank you,
[1908.84] you continue your event.
[1910.80] I have to go.
[1934.56] Mr. Salman.
[1938.04] Sir, you cannot leave like this.
[1940.56] Master, I have a really
 important meeting.
[1942.32] I have to go.
[1943.52] You must have so much time that
[1945.44] you have a cup of tea with our staff.
[1948.16] Everyone wants to meet you.
[1950.16] Look, I would have surely stayed,
[1951.68] but a lot of time  has passed.
[1953.60] But next time for sure.
[1955.00] Okay, as you wish.
[1956.84] But thank you very much.
[1958.68] My pleasure.
[1981.16] Mr. Salman is a big 
businessman of the city.
[1984.28] I thought it would be a cheque of 
three to four hundred thousand.
[1988.36] How much is the cheque for, master?
[1990.88] Naseem, for two million.
[1994.12] Two million?
[1995.80] Yes.
[1997.88] How much did you say, papa?
[1999.80] Two million, child.
[2002.48] Two million?
[2003.76] Yes.
[2006.80] Such a big sum of money 
for the donation.
[2010.08] Yes, so child,
[2011.24] your father is telling us
[2013.28] that he is a big businessman.
[2016.56] He is a really good, young man.
[2050.60] Yes?
[2051.72] Sir, some Urooj Shoaib 
has come to meet you.
[2058.52] Send her in.
[2059.68] Okay sir.
[2061.04] Madam,
[2061.72] when you go from here,
 sir is in the first room.
[2064.04] Thank you.
[2096.92] Come in.
[2125.56] Oh, Miss Urooj.
[2127.28] Welcome. Welcome.
[2129.76] Have a seat.
[2131.96] Okay tell me, what will you have?
[2133.92] Tea? Coffee? Juice?
[2138.08] No thanks.
[2142.40] Can I know
[2144.16] why are you are blessing 
my father so much?
[2151.04] Blessing?
[2153.16] What blessing?
[2155.68] Look whatever
 I did was not for your father,
[2159.32] in fact, it was for the children 
who couldn’t afford laptops.
[2164.20] You are wrong.
[2166.60] You are trying to impress 
me with your wealth.
[2172.04] There is nothing like that.
[2173.28] That’s how it is
[2175.00] and this action of 
yours was really cheap.
[2179.36] I feel you still haven’t forgiven me.
[2182.36] You always take me wrong.
[2187.28] Such cheap actions of yours 
won’t make a difference to me.
[2194.20] And I know rich people like you well.
[2200.80] Who only want to impress girls 
by showing off their wealth.
[2206.40] Urooj.
[2243.84] Urooj.
[2247.24] Urooj, listen to me.
[2251.92] I don’t want to hear anything.
[2253.36] But I want to talk to you.
