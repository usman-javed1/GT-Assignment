It is so hot, the sun is shooting fire. And things have become so expensive. Naseema, I have brought the grocery. Greetings papa. Greetings. 
When did you come, child? A little while back. Your mother thought of making korma, 
and you have come. Now we will enjoy having korma. 
Where is Naseema? She is inside, she is coming. What is the matter, child? 
You are really quiet. Nothing, papa. 
Just like that. Will Salman come in the evening? No, he won’t come. Yes, that’s the issue of a businessman. He is really busy. He is not busy with business, he is busy with the marriage. Really? Whose marriage? His own marriage. What? What are you saying? You come inside. See what Arooj is saying. I will tell you. You will get unwell. 
You come inside with me. Hey, Naseema. So your mother didn’t tell you 
to take back this stupid decision? Mama and papa know when I do what, and with 
what thinking I do it. Even when choosing such 
a big path for your life. They brought me up. Now they will just trust me. Okay, here you go. No, I don’t feel like it. Why? What happened? 
Are you feeling okay? Show me. I feel like vomiting since morning, I am not well. Really? Are you joking? No, I am right. Why? Arooj, I think it is something else. Now you are joking with me, aunt. What hopes can you have from a woman who cannot become a mother? I cannot be a mother, and you are saying I am not unlucky. Arooj, I don’t consider this bad luck. You don’t think anything Salman, but people think. Or maybe they will surely 
make a decision too. Arooj, do you even know what mama 
is insistent about? I know Salman and I also know that you are fighting 
a war with aunty in my love. I cannot see you worried. This wedding will take place, aunt. He will get married 
where you want him. Arooj, have faith. Nothing like this will happen. You are my love. Tell me Salman, which will be my room in two days? Where will I stay? Arooj, no one will snatch 
your room from you. It is better to share love, 
instead of losing it. And I even agree to half your love. But Arooj, I want your complete love. Is it possible that I think of something and it doesn’t happen. Thank God, Arooj didn’t have a child. Now it has become really easy for me 
to get rid of her. And I am bringing my Salman’s bride 
by my choice. Now Alizeh will be my daughter-in-law. Master, have tea. I don’t feel like having anything. How many tests are there 
in my daughter’s fate? One test after another. The tests done end. Oh my God, give patience to my daughter. Give her strength, my Lord. Master, He is really beneficent and merciful. God doesn’t test anyone 
more than their strength. If He has given difficulties, He will also make it easy. Ameen. I have chosen Alizeh for you, and I will get you two married 
on this weekend. The appointment for the salon 
was for 4 pm. It is 5 pm. There is always a rush 
at the salon anyway. Ayesha Dosani called me so many times 
from the parlour. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come. Arooj. Little madam, 
what happened to you? Are you okay, child?
I feel dizzy. I don’t feel good. Okay come on. Driver, 
take us to the hospital. Seat her. Open the door. Seat her. Sit. Sit. Open the door. Let’s go to the hospital, come on. Careful, little madam. Tell us, what issue does she have?
Come on. How many children do you have earlier? What? I have no children. In fact, I cannot become a mother. Who said this to you? I had got a test done. This was in the reports. The reports can be wrong too. What? In fact, you were expecting. And I don’t know if you 
don’t have children, then why did you want to abort 
this first child? Me? I… What are you saying doctor. Yes. She is in this condition due to 
an overdose of some medication. I took some medication? I… No, no, that’s not possible doctor, Arooj is not taking any 
such medication. That’s what has happened. 
That is why she got unwell. The medication didn’t suit her. What are you doing here 
in my room? Huh? I was cleaning up,
and I found this medication. I thought I would keep it 
in the drawer. How many times have I told you 
not to get into my things? Huh? Have I not told you? Doctor, what medication is this? This is a medication to stop pregnancy. Madam, I saw this medication 
in madam Alizeh’s room. Are you speaking the truth? Yes, madam, I am speaking the truth. Why did you stop? 
Come on. I don’t want to talk to anyone 
about anything. Child, why don’t you want to talk? This is the time. The truth is out in the open now. What truth? Even if the report of me not being 
a mother was true, Salman said he would not get married. And here? Here, his promise turned out to be a lie. Arooj. Arooj. Wasai, you come with me. Salman. Where are you going? I had told her to get ready 
and come on stage, but she didn’t listen to me. Mom, I feel Arooj is not well, 
let me check on her once… There is no need for you 
to go anywhere. Mom, I…
I told you, go sit in your place. Come madam. Where did you see it? One minute. Wasai, it is also possible you had 
a misunderstanding. No madam, I saw it with my own eyes. Did you check all these books? Look at this! Oh my God. This means Alizeh was playing with my Arooj’s life. Anyway, one thing is decided. The report of Arooj not being able 
to be a mother is incorrect. Wasai, come quickly. 
Come on. Close it. Okay. Arooj, nothing like this will happen. I will not let anything happen to you. What I want will happen. No one will come between me and you, I promise you this. Arooj, let’s go. We don’t have time. 
Come quickly. Where do we have to go aunt? Come with me, I will tell you everything.
 Come on. One minute, wait. 
What happened? Salman Ahmad, son of Waqar Ahmad, you are being married to Alizeh, daughter of Mukeem Ahmad, with a wedding gift of 
twenty-five hundred thousand, in the presence of these witnesses. Do you accept this marriage? I apologize, molvi sahib. You will have to stop this wedding. Sister-in-law, what are you saying? I am absolutely right, Mehreen. Please, stop this wedding now. Not now sister-in-law. Now this wedding will take place. Not at all. Mehreen, you just answer me, 
why do you want to marry Salman again? Sister-in-law, this is not the time
for these things. This is the time. Please answer me. Why do you want to marry Salman again? Because Arooj cannot become a mother and she cannot give a child to my Salman, that is why this wedding is happening. Fine. I will remove this misunderstanding of yours. We are coming from the doctor. Here, this is the report. Read it. This Alizeh had that false report made. Arooj can become a mother. And this is the medication, Alizeh gave to Arooj, so that she cannot become a mother. Sister-in-law, what proof do you have against Alizeh? I found all this medication from her room. Now you believe me, right? The lie has been revealed. The planning with which you came 
to this home is unsuccessful. Those who come secretly 
are called thieves, they don’t become owners of the home. Get lost from our lives. Get out of here. Did you not hear me? Look if you think that this is my plan, then this plan will be complete 
in two days, then I will be Salman’s wife. So you can think what you want. In fact, you took too long 
to understand this. You should have understood it
a long time back. Are you still upset with me? I am not upset. I am sad. Meaning, you are saying that 
I have given you sorrow. Are you asking me a question
or accepting it? If it is a question, then, what will be your answer? Yes. You have given me sorrow. If the reports had not come in, then you would have gotten married.
