Areej. My baby, be quiet. 
Daddy is here. Be quiet. What is wrong? Areej… Wasai. Wasai. Wasai. Where is this Wasai? Mom, come here. Areej is crying. Areej, my baby. Who are you? My name is Chandu, madam Shaista hired 
me for the job today. So, the child was crying, 
could you not hear her? Yes, I heard it. Then why did you not come? Madam has told me not 
to touch the child. Okay, go from here. Areej. Areej, be quiet. My heart is really restless. I don’t know what condition 
Areej would be in, would she have eaten 
something or not? I am really worried. Don’t worry like this, child. Her grandmother 
will take care of her. Salman is so cruel. He didn’t even think that how such a small child will 
live without her mother. Areej should be with me, 
right now, mama. Come sister Mehreen. See the condition she has
 put herself into. I know sister Naseema. She spent the whole night 
sitting on the bed. This way, she will get unwell crying. We should take help from the police. You are right. If we have to get Areej, then we will have to take
 help from the police or else Salman will 
never give us Areej. He is really stubborn. No, sister Mehreen, we shouldn’t go to the police. Why, master? Master, what is bad in that? Everyone knows Salman is 
a stubborn and crazy boy. Our police report will 
make him angry. But, this way, we will get Areej, right? Sister Mehreen, 
you are right about that. But he can do anything 
because of his failure. Anything. I want to save my Arooj’s 
home at all cost. That’s it. You are calling us cheaters? No need to argue, Arooj, You leave from here, don’t blow this out 
of proportions. You people have blown 
it out of proportions. Now the matter will end. I am ending this matter. You had the right to 
start the matter, not to end it. I will end it. Look, child, how she is misbehaving… Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future. Look here. Salman. Salman. Do you have no manners to talk? You are at peace, right? I don’t like it at all. You will find the marks 
of the slaps you... ... hit on my face on 
your existence. She is my daughter. I say, leave her. I will not let you bring her up. Leave her I say. Give her to me. Leave her. She is my daughter and I will not let you bring her up. Salman, son, don’t do that. We will sit and talk. Come. The time to sit and 
talk has passed. Leave her, I cannot live without her. Why can you not
 live without her? Did you not live 
without your mother? She is my daughter, 
she will live with me. You cannot do this. Salman, stop. Salman! On one hand there are my parents, who didn’t give birth to me, they only brought me up. But, they cannot see their 
daughter’s home get ruined, and on the other hand, 
there is Salman’s parents who in their greed for money, are ruining their own son’s home. Arooj. If you feel that I made the wrong 
decision to leave home, then we will go back home. No, I am standing with you
 in your decision. Now, whatever will happen, we will deal with it. I will check. Younger madam. Wasai, you? Is all okay? Where is elder madam? She is inside. Okay, you come inside. Come. Sure. Mama. Come. Mama. Mama. Come. Wasai, you? How are you? I am fine elder madam. Are you fine? Yes, Wasai, I am fine. Come, have a seat. What is the matter Wasai? What happened? Elder madam, I have quit my job there. Now I am going back to my village. Why, Wasai? I cannot live with those people. Wasai, is everything fine? Are you coming from 
there right now? No, I went to the bus station. Reaching there, I thought how can I leave without 
meeting you people. That’s it, then I came to 
you people searching for you. I found younger madam’s
 home with difficulty. Wasai, I used to scold you a lot, right? Forgive me. No, no, elder madam. What are you saying? Don’t embarrass me saying this. Now give me permission
 elder madam, I will go to my village. Fine, Wasai, you do go to your village, but I will call you back really soon. No matter how dark the night is, its morning is equally 
bright and shiny. You are right. You sit, I will bring tea. No, no, younger madam. What are you saying? Wasai has worked 
herself all her life. Don’t embarrass me saying this. I will make tea and bring 
it for you people. Okay, come with me. I am scolding her because of you. Because of me? Yes, because of you. But don’t worry, now she will not have to 
get scolded because of you. Because now you and 
your daughter won’t live in this home. What? Don’t act so naïve, you know well what your 
beloved daughter has done. Arooj didn’t do anything 
sister-in-law, Salman was cheating 
her into signing. Be quiet. You are calling my son a cheater. Your daughter is a cheater, who played this whole 
game for this property. But sister-in-law… Stop it. Now you and your daughter
 have nothing left to say. You and your daughter leave from this home. What are you saying? I am saying what you heard. Now, go, take your daughter and
 leave from this home. Remember, I am saying this really nicely. Take your daughter and go from here. I shouldn’t see you here. Nothing will happen. 
Daddy is here. Quiet. Quiet. Areej. Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Mom, is this the time to sleep? What is wrong with you Salman? This is the time I wake up. Then you will have to 
change this routine. Why? Did you not hear Areej 
crying so much? How will I hear her while 
sleeping, Salman? Look, I don’t want to argue with you. I am just saying that you will
 have to take care of Areej. Salman, son, 
try and understand. I cannot take care of such 
a small child in this age. I get tired. You are right. How can you take care of her? You don’t have experience. What do you mean? You gave someone else 
your child to take care of, then where will you get
 experience from? Huh? You are misbehaving with me. I am not misbehaving with you. I am just telling you that you will have to take care of Areej. I have to go to the office, I have to take care of
 the responsibilities there. If I didn’t have to go, I would have taken care of her. You can at least take 
up this responsibility, she is your granddaughter. Okay, come on, give her to me. I will take care of her. Did you have breakfast? I will have it in the office. Keep her here. You go, don’t worry, 
I will take care of her. Come on, go. If we have to get Areej, then we will have to take 
help from the police or else Salman will 
never give us Areej. He is really stubborn. No, sister Mehreen, we shouldn’t go to the police. Why, master? Master, what is bad in that? Everyone knows Salman is
 a stubborn and crazy boy. Our police report will 
make him angry. But, this way, we will get Areej, right? Sister Mehreen, 
you are right about that. But he can do anything
 because of his failure. Anything. What is the matter, Arooj? Do you want to call someone? I cannot tolerate it now. I am calling aunt Shaista. Hey, she… firstly she will not answer the phone and even if she answers it, 
she will misbehave. Why will she misbehave? She is a mother herself. Won’t she care about me? If she was so sensitive, then she wouldn’t have put her son 
in my lap for the greed of money. I will still call. Up to you. Now, what does she want? Yes, why did you call? Aunt, how is Areej? Areej is absolutely fine. No. I don’t think Areej is fine. I can hear her cry. What happened to her? Children cry like this and then they get quiet themselves. They don’t cry like this. She must be in pain, 
why don’t you tell me? Why did you call me 
early in the morning? Is this why you called? Disconnect the call. Aunt, tell me, I will just come. Hello. What happened Arooj? What is that cruel woman saying? Areej is not fine, mama. She was crying loudly. Now even Wasai is not there. Who would take care of her? I have to go to Areej. Nothing will happen Arooj. Nothing will happen to our Areej. Nothing will happen. Nothing will happen. 
Nothing will happen to her. She will be fine. We are leaving. But don’t think that we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people. Mama made me… But, I will come back, and I will surely come. This is my promise to all of you. You are at peace, right? I don’t like it at all. You will find the marks
 of the slaps you ... ...hit on my face on your existence. She is my daughter. I say, leave her. I will not let you bring her up. Leave her I say. Give her to me. Leave her. She is my daughter and I will not let you
 bring her up. Salman, son, don’t do that. We will sit and talk. Come. The time to sit and 
talk has passed. Leave her, I cannot 
live without her. Why can you not 
live without her? Did you not live 
without your mother? She is my daughter, 
she will live with me. You cannot do this. 
Salman, stop. Salman! Oh wow, I can also do this. At times, talent is 
hidden in a person, you don’t see it. But then such a situation arises, that the person finds their talent and then they get surprised. Like I am surprised at myself. Wow. Very well played, Salman. Very well played.
