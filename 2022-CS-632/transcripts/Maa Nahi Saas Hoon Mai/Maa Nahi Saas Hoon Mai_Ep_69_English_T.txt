[21.04] Yes, yes, fine. 
I understand.
[22.84] I understand.
I understand. Okay.
[31.52] What happened?
[33.04] Everything is fine in the office, right?
[35.56] The meeting got cancelled and 
I got blamed for it too.
[37.88] That deal didn’t get finalized, that’s why.
[43.08] So, then?
[45.44] Nothing. I have received a 
show cause notice.
[52.24] Don’t worry,
[54.32] all this will never happen.
[58.00] When all this will be ours.
[61.80] You are being overconfident, 
Shaista.
[65.16] No,
[67.32] I am preparing my soldier 
in the lines of the enemy.
[73.12] Now you don’t worry,
[77.00] everything will be done and
[79.36] our hands will also be clean.
[82.92] You are making me believe it,
[84.76] but don’t think of an idea like you 
thought of earlier.
[91.36] Just wait and watch.
[110.44] Sister in law, I had no hopes,
[113.72] she took the bowl from my hands 
happily and with love.
[119.32] You are really naïve, Mehreen
[121.84] and Arooj is cunning.
[127.48] What is the matter sister in law?
[129.92] You never spoke like this 
about Arooj earlier.
[134.84] What happened now?
[136.20] I made a mistake.
[138.36] I am so sorry.
[140.40] I got late in understanding her.
[145.80] Arooj is actually cunning.
[149.52] She along with Salman,
[151.96] wants to take over this home and 
the entire business.
[158.56] You are right, sister in law,
[162.00] I didn’t think of that.
[192.60] Salman,
[194.40] we will reach today, right?
[197.48] What do you mean?
[199.32] There is a lot of time till it closes.
[201.36] Meaning,
[202.64] the speed at which you are driving,
I feel we will reach after the mall closes.
[207.32] Arooj, you are too much.
[209.64] Look, I am driving the car really carefully.
[212.88] Don’t you know what the doctor say?
[215.44] It is our first baby,
[217.56] we will have to be really careful.
[237.28] Can I say something?
[239.04] Yes, go ahead.
[243.72] You are really good.
[309.68] No matter how much you give 
these damned cats,
[312.60] their stomach is never full.
[315.44] She was having the soup 
in such a manner.
[323.56] Maybe.
[326.00] Maybe that soup was not in 
younger madam’s fate,
[331.48] in fact, it was in the fate 
of this damned cat.
[335.36] Anyway, may God be kind.
[591.56] Where are you going, Arooj?
[592.88] One minute.
[594.20] Brother, do you have methi puri?
[597.16] Make one.
[598.24] Arooj, what are you doing?
You will get a sore throat.
[601.12] Hey, their methi puri 
is really good,
[603.40] I always have it from here.
[606.24] Okay fine, you eat. 
I will not eat it.
[607.84] You too will eat it. 
Okay one minute.
[610.84] I am telling you it is really delicious.
[612.64] Is it ready, brother?
[614.08] Hey, you will get unwell.
[615.92] Nothing happens. See,
how yummy it looks.
[620.56] Okay try one.
[622.16] No, I don’t want to have it,
you eat.
[623.80] Please. Please. Okay one, 
it is really delicious.
[640.64] Hmmm.
[642.76] This is really tasty.
[644.72] I had told you.
[646.12] Brother, make another one.
[647.80] Make one more. Just now you said
you don’t eat it.
[742.00] From today onwards special food 
will be made for little madam,
[747.08] and Wasai will make it 
with her own hands.
[750.96] After ages,
[752.84] the voice of a child will echo 
in this home.
[756.48] Wasai.
[757.68] Wasai.
[759.56] What is the matter? 
Why are you worried?
[762.28] What did you feed the cat?
[764.84] It is dead.
[765.96] It has foam coming out from 
her mouth.
[767.60] She is dead?
[769.44] What are you saying?
[771.20] You come and see yourself.
[785.04] This means,
[789.96] the soup had poison.
[794.72] But who gave this poison?
[802.92] Elder madam
[807.52] or madam?
[813.60] This is something dangerous.
[819.08] What do I do now?
[824.44] It is necessary for me to get 
to the real thing.
[831.28] I have been loyal to this family,
[835.28] I will not let anything wrong happen.
[842.12] Come on. Come. Show me.
[844.08] Come on.
[874.56] Despite mom’s strict tone, 
you were smiling.
[880.16] What is the matter?
[881.88] What happened?
[885.44] Are you jealous?
[888.20] I am not jealous.
[890.56] By the way,
[892.52] there was something.
[894.48] What?
[898.40] Your mood has changed
[901.48] but mom is the same.
[908.64] At times a person should make 
the first move
[914.84] and if you make the first move
 in love,
[919.04] you surely get a response 
in return.
[952.68] Hello Nasir.
[953.80] You know there is a limit 
to indifference.
[956.16] I live in this city
[957.92] No call, no messages.
[960.12] I am really sorry, man, 
I was really busy.
[962.44] By the way, there is good news
for you.
[964.44] Wow. Good news?
[966.36] And you are telling me 
when I called you.
[968.72] I am really disappointed Salman.
[972.20] Okay, man, stop fighting. 
Listen to me.
[975.36] Tell me.
[977.76] You are going to be a uncle.
[980.00] What?
[981.48] Man, this is actually a really 
good news.
[984.08] There is another good news.
[987.20] Arooj has accepted mom.
[992.04] Now her scolding her doesn’t 
make a difference to her.
[995.00] See, how everything is getting 
fine gradually.
[998.76] Congratulations Salman.
[1001.72] When we meet we will talk 
on this topic in detail.
[1005.92] Congratulate sister in law Arooj
on this from me.
[1009.40] Goodbye.
[1010.76] Goodbye.
[1056.04] Salman, we will reach today, right?
[1060.96] What do you mean?
[1062.60] There is a lot of time till it closes.
[1064.80] Meaning,
[1066.28] the speed at which you are driving,
I feel we will reach after the mall closes.
[1070.96] Arooj, you are too much.
[1073.00] Look, I am driving the car really carefully.
[1076.32] Don’t you know what the doctor say?
[1078.76] It is our first baby,
[1081.00] we will have to be really careful.
[1083.64] Can I say something?
[1085.16] Yes, go ahead.
[1087.00] You are really good.
[1149.16] Have you thought if Mehreen finds out 
that Arooj is her daughter, Areej,
[1155.16] then where will we stand?
[1157.44] How many lies will be uncovered 
with this one truth?
[1163.44] Nothing will happen.
[1164.68] You just be smart instead of 
being emotional.
[1166.56] Use your head.
[1168.96] I don’t have so much time that I think,
 I act in my senses.
[1177.16] It will not take a minute for this 
whole game to get spoiled,
[1180.40] and that one minute can also 
be the next minute.
[1186.40] Telling the truth is not that easy, 
you just wait for the opportunity.
[1192.24] Removing Arooj from our way 
is our helplessness,
[1194.92] not our greatness.
[1196.84] The great thing would be that 
she has no proof left with her.
[1208.36] Aunt.
[1217.16] I came to show you something.
[1226.16] Do you know, I have shopped 
for the baby today?
[1229.20] And seriously, it is really difficult 
to shop for children.
[1232.96] I will show you.
[1234.40] I found such cute clothes.
See this.
[1238.36] Pink colour and I got something
in yellow colour.
[1251.72] I got green colour.
[1255.92] Did you like them?
[1267.44] Only you are there in this home,
who is happy in my happiness.
[1276.00] Should I show you the shoes?
You will find them really cute.
[1279.60] Come here.
[1355.36] All this looks so beautiful,
right, Salman?
[1360.28] It looks beautiful, right?
[1361.92] Really beautiful.
[1363.60] You will see
[1366.04] our child will be way more 
beautiful than this.
[1372.36] You know, Salman, 
you are really good.
[1377.60] Really?
[1379.20] How is that?
[1382.48] Because you love the relation that 
has not come in this world so much.
[1400.80] And the day he will be in your arms,
[1404.16] how happy would you be?
[1407.48] Every mother and father love 
their child the same.
[1417.20] And children love the parents.
[1419.36] Like you love and like I love.
[1438.36] Will you have coffee?
[1441.00] Why not?
[1442.60] I will bring it.
[1470.60] Are you feeling okay?
[1475.36] Yes,
[1477.84] I am fine.
[1482.64] Why do you think this?
[1485.84] I will have these thoughts everyday
 till the delivery.
[1493.96] God will make it all fine.
[1499.96] A mother sacrifices so much 
for her children.
[1505.96] The children can never repay 
the favours of their mother.
[1510.80] You are right,
[1513.96] there is no replacement 
for a mother.
[1518.28] A mother is really great.
[1523.28] And you know,
[1526.12] when a girl becomes a 
mother herself,
[1529.64] then her worth of her mother 
increases further in her eyes.
[1549.12] Is the food ready?
[1550.96] Yes, madam, the food is ready.
[1554.12] So why did you not serve it 
on the table yet?
[1556.44] Madam, ten minutes are left.
[1559.28] If I serve it right now, 
it will get cold.
[1565.32] Hmmm.
[1567.48] Is Arooj food ready?
[1569.16] Yes, yes, her food is also ready.
[1572.04] What did you cook?
Did you cook this?
[1576.28] It will get cold, madam.
[1589.88] Yes, so you do one thing,
[1593.72] before you serve food, 
go clean the dining table. Go.
[1597.20] I cleaned it before you asking me.
[1628.52] No matter what you do, madam.
[1633.44] I will not move from here.
[1639.92] I don’t know what she will 
add to the food.
[1670.52] Fine, tell me when food is served.
[1673.48] Sure, sure.
[1684.60] Wasai, did you prepare the food?
[1687.68] Yes, yes, madam.
[1689.44] I had prepared the juice and kept it
in the fridge to cool it.
[1696.08] I will just give it to you.
[1708.16] Hurry up.
[1734.12] Thank you.
[1735.84] Elder madam,
[1737.60] are you taking this juice 
for younger madam?
[1740.84] Why will I take juice for Arooj, 
am I her servant?
[1746.04] I tried what I had to, once. 
That’s it.
[1750.32] Sure.
[1755.52] I had my doubts on both of them
[1759.92] that hating younger madam,
[1764.56] who can add the poison.
[1769.24] Elder madam doesn’t care at all,
[1774.88] so that leaves, madam.
[1780.60] I can only doubt her.
[1828.48] Where are you going so dressed up?
[1831.80] There is a business dinner,
I am getting ready for that.
[1834.72] Help me put on the coat.
[1836.16] Business dinner? 
You didn’t even tell me.
[1840.76] Yes, it slipped my mind.
[1842.88] I just remembered so I told you.
[1845.40] Hmmm.
[1846.48] Then do one thing, 
keep me as your PA.
[1849.40] I will remind you of all your appointments.
[1861.00] You are the owner of my heart,
[1864.04] how can I keep you as my PA?
[1903.28] Arooj.
[1904.80] What happened, Arooj?
[1907.08] I felt dizzy. I don’t know why.
[1909.44] You feel dizzy?
[1911.88] Come, we will go to the hospital. 
I will get the dinner cancelled.
[1914.32] No, I am fine.
[1916.04] Nothing to worry about. 
I just felt dizzy.
[1919.96] Arooj, what happened to you?
Look at you.
[1922.20] You are not fine.
[1924.04] Relax. I am absolutely fine.
[1929.64] No need to cancel the dinner,
[1932.08] just try to come a little sooner.
[1935.60] Are you sure?
Sure.
[1955.16] Take care of yourself. 
Yes.
[1958.72] Okay, you sit.
[1960.32] I am fine, you go.
 I am fine.
[1969.40] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[1975.12] I don’t know what has happened.
[2013.56] You really have to take care of Arooj.
[2017.40] In fact, you have to tell Salman
[2019.76] how much you love Arooj,
[2023.00] What will happen then?
What will happen then?
[2026.44] Salman will praise you.
[2030.04] And if Arooj misbehaves
[2032.68] then you will see,
[2033.96] he will drag her out of the home 
in one minute.
[2038.08] If Arooj misbehaves with me,
[2041.28] then my Salman will kill her.
[2048.44] So, fine, you understand 
what I said, right?
[2052.12] You just have to take care of Arooj.
[2057.72] You have to love Arooj so much
[2060.56] that Arooj too believes your love.
[2064.20] Salman is your own,
[2066.84] then you have nothing 
to worry about.
[2070.80] Really sister in law? 
Is that so?
[2089.16] Mehreen, what are you doing here?
[2091.28] First you tell me 
what are you doing here?
[2093.56] And look, please, 
don’t touch anything.
[2098.72] I cannot find it.
[2101.88] This…
[2104.84] Oh God.
[2106.00] What have you done? 
Take it, Wasai.
[2109.28] Check things for once. Clean up. 
You never take care.
[2118.40] This picture…
[2126.64] Take it away, quickly. 
Go, quickly.
[2136.56] You had called me.
[2139.16] I called you two hours back
[2142.08] and you are coming now.
[2143.72] Madam, I was working,
[2152.48] so I got a little late. I apologize.
[2156.68] Really?
[2158.16] Were you working or were you 
planning on killing someone?
[2162.16] What do you mean?
[2163.64] I didn’t understand madam.
[2171.24] Why are you saying this?
[2173.36] You ask yourself this.
[2178.00] I don’t know.
[2179.92] But I know everything, Wasai.
[2183.20] What do you know?
[2184.80] That nowadays you are being 
really loyal to Arooj.
[2190.40] I am a servant,
[2193.12] I am loyal to everyone.
[2195.92] Really?
[2197.72] So tell me, my loyal servant,
[2201.68] how did this secret get out?
[2205.24] What secret?
[2207.00] That Arooj is Areej and 
she is Mehreen’s daughter.
[2213.16] No, I didn’t do anything.
[2216.92] I know nothing.
[2219.28] You can make me swear.
[2221.56] Oh wow, Wasai.
[2224.96] You turned out to be a great actor.
[2234.44] You are really cunning.
[2237.64] You used to always be with Arooj,
[2241.12] you used to show her love.
[2243.60] Despite me asking you, 
you didn’t burn that picture,
[2246.96] in fact you kept it safe with you,
[2249.28] so that you show it to Arooj. 
Huh?
[2253.44] You should be ashamed.
[2256.48] You are really disloyal.
[2264.44] Get lost from here,
[2266.56] and yes,
[2270.68] If I see you around Arooj,
[2275.04] then I will teach you a lesson
[2277.84] that you will never forget. 
Go from here.
[2281.32] I understand.
