[38.72] I am amazed by you, Arooj.
[41.48] You turned out to be so cunning 
at such a young age.
[51.20] You didn’t like what I said?
[58.96] You shouldn’t like it either,
[61.12] even I want that.
[66.88] Aunty, I am working.
[68.88] It must be really difficult to work alone.
[72.32] Now that boy is not there either…
[78.24] what is his name?
[79.56] He has a smart name.
[82.80] Ammad.
[86.56] If you are done talking, 
then can I complete my work?
[90.04] Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
[91.56] You know what, Arooj?
[94.76] I used to think that I am the only 
smart one in this world.
[104.36] But you turned out to be more 
cunning than me, Arooj.
[112.28] You fired that Ammad
[115.60] and you made that poor thing resign?
[120.88] I didn’t fire him.
[125.36] He resigned from the job himself
 and went.
[127.96] If it was in my hands, 
I would never have fired him.
[132.64] No matter, what the method,
[135.76] now that boy will not stay 
in this office.
[143.08] Do you have any idea
[149.84] that a helpless man quit his job 
because of your stubbornness.
[196.04] That boy Ammad,
[198.80] is a really good boy, Arooj.
[202.44] Injustice has been done for him.
[209.96] Why don’t you do anything for him?
[213.72] Yes, aunt,
[215.96] and I am unable to do whatever 
I can do for him.
[223.00] How will he get his mother such 
an expensive treatment?
[230.12] What can I say aunt?
[236.52] You can help him, right, child?
[239.72] He believes in hard work and not help.
[249.24] God forbid, if something happens 
to his mother, then?
[255.52] That’s what I am worried about, aunt.
[258.56] God forbid if something happens, then?
[345.52] Okay tell me,
[347.00] did you forward the email to 
Hamdan association?
[350.12] Yes, sir.
[351.96] Okay, perfect.
[356.72] Excuse me.
[361.52] Yes, mom?
[363.36] How are you, Salman?
[365.84] I am fine.
[367.64] Salman,
[369.72] you always think that 
I don’t like Arooj at all.
[378.80] But my love,
[380.96] today I feel really sorry for Arooj.
[386.88] Mom, I don’t understand.
[393.00] When will you come from office?
[395.88] Come a little early.
[399.24] Mom, what happened? All okay?
[402.84] Yes,
[405.04] everything is fine.
[407.80] Arooj is a little worried.
[411.24] She is depression.
[414.88] I think she is really sad about Ammad 
leaving like this, suddenly.
[431.28] Hello, Salman?
[434.04] Are you listening?
[439.04] Yes,
[442.32] I heard it.
[444.20] Okay come on, you do your work
[446.88] and come a little early in the evening.
[519.72] Ammad, it is fine now.
[521.60] You take care of aunty, I will go myself.
[524.52] You know, thank you.
[526.44] Thank you so much that you came.
Even mama liked it.
[529.24] What is there to thank me for?
[530.80] I had to meet aunty anyway,
[532.84] and it is good I asked how she was.
[535.80] You know, I too wanted to thank you.
[539.56] Thank you to me? 
What for?
[544.40] You sacrificed your job and 
saved Arooj’s home.
[549.64] Man,
[551.84] you have to sacrifice in friendship,
[556.48] or else what use is the relation.
[560.08] Relation?
[562.52] Even Arooj and brother Salman 
had a relation,
[565.60] but they don’t have any sacrifice
in their relationship,
[568.56] nor is there any tolerance.
[571.40] You are right.
[574.24] But I don’t want to interfere in 
Arooj’s personal life.
[580.04] Even mama told me not to interfere 
in the matters of a woman a lot.
[585.64] So, I did the same in Arooj’s matter,
[588.76] so that Salman doesn’t have 
a problem.
[592.36] Ammad, you made a big sacrifice 
and you will see,
[596.28] God will bless you for it.
[599.64] Okay leave it,
[601.16] do tell me if you want to do anything.
[604.48] What use can you be to me?
You do one thing,
[609.12] till I am unemployed, then come 
to meet me daily.
[613.76] You will not learn, right?
[616.32] Okay, I came to meet you short on time,
[618.72] but next time I will come with some time,
 then we will sit comfortably.
[621.68] Till then take care of your mama.
[624.52] Thank you.
[626.16] Okay, I will go now. Goodbye.
[656.88] Shanzay, you?
[659.12] How are you?
[660.08] I am absolutely fine. You tell me, 
how are you?
[662.04] Absolutely fine. Surprise.
[665.08] After Ammad left your work load 
would have increased a lot, right?
[669.12] Yes. The work has increased
but no issues.
[672.72] I will manage.
[674.00] Hmmmm. You are right.
[677.00] The void formed by someone 
leaving gets filled.
[682.48] Did you meet him?
[684.36] Yes, I met him.
[686.68] Is he fine?
[688.12] He is fine.
[691.08] But his mother is not doing that good.
[698.76] Yes,
[701.28] and I don’t understand
[703.60] how he will get his mother treated.
[708.76] You are his friend, well-wisher,
[711.72] but your family issues got resolved 
with him leaving, right?
[714.64] That is good.
[718.24] But I don’t understand one thing,
[720.60] he really needed a job.
[723.68] He resigned and left?
[728.52] Arooj, he had found out about you 
and brother Salman,
[734.04] so he left.
[739.76] What?
[745.68] But who told him?
[750.20] I had told him.
[753.44] Oh my God. 
Shanzay,
[757.04] are you stupid?
Why did you tell him?
[760.72] Arooj he will find a job anywhere,
[763.52] but your family issues couldn’t have 
been sorted.
[766.52] Hey, I would have handled Salman,
[769.24] but you shouldn’t have worried him 
telling him about it.
[777.16] Man, I did what I thought was right 
at that time.
[782.92] I am really sorry for that poor thing.
[785.28] Arooj, a friend sacrifices for a friend.
[791.92] I was telling him,
Salman loves me a lot,
[797.68] and what would he be thinking about me
 finding out all this?
[801.28] Arooj, your family issues are 
more important than all this,
[806.04] okay?
[811.24] Okay, now leave all this. 
I will go now,
[814.52] I have to go get medication for mama.
[817.24] Have coffee.
[818.60] Next time. Right now I have to go.
[821.84] Okay. 
Okay?
[823.32] Take care of yourself,
we will meet later.
[825.56] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[852.08] Hello.
[854.08] How are you Ammad?
[855.36] I am absolutely fine.
[856.84] You tell me, how are you?
[858.92] How is Mr. Salman and the matters
 of the accounts.
[862.32] Yes, it is all fine.
[866.32] You sound really happy to me 
quitting the job.
[870.36] You know me,
[872.24] I always stay happy.
[874.24] Yes, I knew you well,
[878.24] but now I feel I know you much better.
[882.84] Good. By the way,
[884.76] what have you found out about me?
[888.32] The reason
[891.60] why you quit the job?
[894.08] Man, I thought I was not fit 
for the job, so I quit it.
[898.64] Just shut up, Ammad,
[901.12] you don’t look good lying.
[903.80] I don’t look good? Okay, good,
[906.40] I shouldn’t look good either.
[908.48] Be careful, I am an eastern boy.
[912.08] Okay, stop it. Don’t change the topic.
[914.44] Shanzay told me why you left 
the job and went.
[920.04] That damned Shanzay told you 
everything?
[923.28] Yes.
[925.24] You know I am thankful to Shanzay
[929.00] that she told me everything honestly
[933.64] or else I was unknowingly becoming 
the reason to add poison to your lives.
[941.24] By the way,
[943.48] I shouldn’t ask because I know 
what you will say, but fine,
[948.24] I will still ask you.
[951.00] Will you rejoin the office?
[952.76] You yourself are saying 
you know my answer,
[955.72] still you are asking me?
[960.84] Thanks.
[964.52] You are really stubborn.
[966.96] Okay,
[969.72] best of luck. 
Take care of yourself.
[973.36] Goodbye.
[974.80] Goodbye.
[1069.96] Arooj is a little worried.
[1074.44] She is depression.
[1079.32] I think
[1083.44] she is really sad about Ammad 
leaving like this, suddenly.
[1105.68] You took long to come.
[1109.88] Was there a lot of work in the office?
[1114.80] Yes,
[1116.44] there was a lot of work in the office.
[1121.64] Yes,
[1123.68] after all, now Ammad is not there
[1129.24] so you must have to do all the work.
[1131.80] Yes,
[1133.20] I am having difficulty in work, but okay,
 at least you are happy.
[1147.44] So, are you not happy? Are you sad?
[1151.72] I am sad that
[1153.68] he found out about the cheapness 
of our small talk.
[1159.92] He is my friend.
[1162.00] He quit the job for my sake.
[1165.16] He saved my home.
[1168.72] There is nothing like that.
[1172.32] You are thinking wrong.
[1175.84] He was a really smart man,
[1178.48] he knew he would get caught, 
that is why he left himself.
[1184.60] You know what?
[1187.20] You are insulting me now.
[1193.52] What do you think there was 
something between us,
[1196.48] and he would have gotten caught, 
that’s why…
[1200.36] it is really disappointing.
[1204.56] There is nothing like that.
[1207.80] After all, you really sympathize with him,
[1209.88] I can see that.
[1215.00] Yes,
[1217.60] I do sympathize
[1223.76] with his ill mother,
[1226.28] who is a cancer patient.
[1239.08] Really?
[1241.80] Then he made a big mistake by resigning.
[1248.88] If we would have fired him, then at least 
we would have given me a month’s salary,
[1252.72] it would have helped him.
[1255.80] Actually, not everything is business.
[1259.24] Some things are beyond simple addition.
[1267.60] If you want, I can help him.
[1275.80] His mother will get treated.
[1277.96] Huh?
[1280.12] You, will help him?
[1286.44] Hah, thank you so much.
[1290.32] Kindly clear his dues soon.
[1294.84] That poor thing needs money.
[1299.08] You will help him.
[1346.36] So,
[1348.48] how are you Salman’s mama?
[1352.80] That I am.
[1357.84] But you didn’t do good with Salman.
[1361.80] You are saying the same thing again?
I didn’t do anything with Salman,
[1365.44] what I did was with that cunning Arooj.
[1370.56] What do you think?
[1373.72] Did that action of yours 
not affect Salman?
[1380.64] He got so worried.
[1383.96] What did you get out of this?
[1386.56] Ammad got fired, he was dangerous 
for the company.
[1389.92] and the drama you had created 
against Arooj,
[1393.00] that was not successful.
[1396.72] You have only humiliated that innocent 
child Arooj in this entire game.
[1402.28] This is an allegation on me.
[1406.28] Whatever I did was for the best 
interest of the company.
[1409.60] Arooj didn’t have good intentions.
[1413.04] Don’t forget Idrees,
[1415.88] the coin of humiliation you spin
in the market,
[1419.76] it comes back to you one day.
[1423.28] But why are you saying this to me?
[1426.92] I wish
[1428.64] you were as innocent 
as you pose to be.
[1434.20] Even you are not innocent, 
I will remind you.
[1439.96] The truth cannot hide because of 
the things you are saying.
[1445.08] You will have to answer for the injustice
 you did with Arooj.
[1480.12] Yes, greetings. 
Greetings.
[1482.16] I want to meet Mr. Salman.
[1483.64] Your good name.
[1485.32] Ammad.
[1487.44] Okay, I will call him.
[1496.88] Hello. 
Sir, sir Ammad is here.
[1498.96] You had asked me to inform you 
when he comes.
[1501.32] Yes, send him in.
[1502.96] Okay sir.
[1512.48] Come with me. 
Sure.
[1532.84] Sir,
[1534.56] Mr. Ammad is here.
[1539.20] Okay, you can leave.
[1541.36] Okay listen. 
Yes?
[1544.04] Send two cups of coffee. 
Okay, Sir.
[1547.96] Come. Have a seat.
[1554.92] Yes, sir, go ahead.
[1558.96] I had to clear a few dues of yours.
[1562.88] Sir, this is the job of the account officer,
[1565.16] I will go there.
[1567.88] Yes, but I called them to me.
[1572.80] I wanted that I meet you one last time.
[1577.08] Thank you. Thank you, sir.
[1582.36] So, tell me,
[1584.64] how do you feel leaving our office?
[1587.72] Sir, you tell me what you want 
to hear and enjoy,
[1591.76] I will say that.
[1595.96] Leave it.
[1598.96] No,
[1600.96] I will tell you.
[1605.60] I need a job,
[1607.92] but it is true that your company 
needs me right now.
[1617.40] This will be proved to you 
as time passes.
[1623.12] We will find someone better than you 
when the time comes.
[1630.24] I am good at recognizing people.
[1633.56] Sir,
[1635.48] thousands of people would be 
better than me,
[1639.84] and as far as your claims of recognizing 
people is concerned,
[1643.44] this is not proven, 
you have to prove it.
[1649.88] Okay,
[1651.64] we will also see this.
[1656.88] Well,
[1661.44] these are your pending dues.
[1665.72] Keep it.
[1670.08] And this is a cheque for 
five hundred thousand
[1675.08] for your mother’s treatment.
[1679.80] Sir, I am happy that you thought 
about my mother,
[1687.72] but I am so sorry, 
I cannot take this.
[1693.44] Keep it.
[1696.24] It will come in use.
[1697.60] Sir, I told you,
[1700.08] I cannot take this.
[1708.60] And yes,
[1712.28] your claim to recognizing people 
is not correct.
[1720.56] Thank you.
[1740.64] Sir greetings.
[1741.96] Greetings, Nawaz.
[1743.40] Sir, I have worked with you,
[1745.16] if I have made a mistake, 
please forgive me.
[1746.96] You are a really good man.
[1748.36] When is a man good, his work, 
his character is good.
[1753.80] Sir, whatever happened was wrong.
[1756.84] One good thing has happened,
[1758.56] you got a cheque for five hundred thousand. 
I got it made.
[1763.12] Yes, I left that cheque on 
Mr. Salman’s table.
[1770.68] You left a cheque worth 
five hundred thousand,
[1773.36] what sort of a man are you?
[1775.76] Sarwat, what do I tell you 
what problems I am in nowadays,
[1780.60] and the issues I am facing.
[1783.44] But, don’t worry, 
I will fix everything soon…
[1793.36] I will talk to you later. 
Yes, yes, fine.
[1801.28] Anyway,
[1802.80] sir, my prayers are with you.
[1805.52] I pray that you get a really good job.
[1809.64] Sir, if you want me to do something, 
then let me know.
[1811.80] I will stay in contact with you.
Sure Nawaz. Thank you.
[1824.48] He left a cheque of five hundred thousand.
[1827.64] Wow.
[1841.60] Send Nawaz inside to me.
[1843.88] Yes, right now.
[1862.44] Yes, boss, you called?
[1864.40] Yes.
[1866.76] You were really sharing secrets 
with Ammad. Huh?
[1871.40] Boss, what secret would I share.
[1873.36] I was sympathizing with him, that injustice
has been done with him.
[1877.36] Okay, okay, then you must have also 
cursed the ones who did injustice with him.
[1882.24] Boss, that is not needed, 
it is done automatically.
[1886.96] He is the enemy of the company, 
and you are sympathizing with him?
[1889.92] No, boss, I was just trying 
to take benefit
[1892.60] that maybe he will go to a good office,
then he will also call me.
[1895.72] Why? Is this not a good place?
[1897.60] It is a good place, but I always 
have a fear of being fired.
[1901.96] You know you are really farsighted 
you know.
[1904.24] Yes, sir, I have gone through so much,
[1907.04] I have become farsighted.
[1910.20] Okay fine, leave now.
[1911.28] Don’t drive me mad. You always say 
something like this.
[1913.48] Leave. 
Yes, boss.
[1920.88] Farsighted.
[1931.64] Yes, that’s fine.
[1934.00] Fine, send it, I am waiting.
[1936.12] Okay. Okay,
[1938.68] bye.
[1949.96] Hey come on,
[1952.84] now you don’t get time to come 
to your mother.
[1958.88] There is nothing like that mom.
[1964.56] You know,
[1968.04] I am so caught up in business tension.
[1970.92] Yes,
[1972.64] but your biggest tension is over.
[1978.00] You are at peace.
[1982.60] Which one?
[1983.96] That boy Ammad.
[1990.64] He left, right? It is good.
[1997.96] I have made a really big mistake.
[2001.40] Mistake?
[2003.48] What mistake?
[2007.40] That Ammad.
[2012.96] He was not a bad boy.
[2019.32] I feel all of us made a really big mistake.
[2024.28] If he was not a bad boy,
[2027.68] then was Arooj wrong?
[2035.08] I don’t know.
[2039.00] You are saying,
[2041.16] that I am wrong.
[2046.88] The one who saw everything 
with her eyes, then…
[2049.76] Yes, but you didn’t see anything else.
[2052.72] What is wrong, Salman? 
What do you want to say?
[2055.36] I am sure Arooj said this to you.
[2057.36] Mom, no one told me this.
[2061.92] I am just saying that 
he was a good boy.
[2065.44] I am the one who had a 
misunderstanding.
[2068.96] And Arooj?
[2073.52] I think she is not wrong.
[2136.56] Ammad came to the office today
[2139.36] to get the cheque for his dues.
[2145.96] I even offered to help him, 
but he refused.
[2158.24] I am saying something to you.
[2167.88] I am talking to you, why are you 
not answering me?
[2171.96] You have full right to think 
what you want,
[2175.08] who can stop you?
[2177.56] So, you can at least behave properly.
[2179.88] At least answer what I am asking.
[2182.96] I don’t even want to discuss the topic 
I don’t want to talk about.
[2189.72] Arooj.
