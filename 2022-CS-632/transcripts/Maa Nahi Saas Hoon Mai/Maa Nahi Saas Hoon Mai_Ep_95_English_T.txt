[21.16] You are the reason behind
Arooj being in this house,
[25.48] you are important even
for Mehreen.,
[35.52] that’s why you are
the only one
[37.64] who can take this entire
property from Arooj.
[44.28] But how?
[45.96] With love,
[48.52] attention, passion.
[52.12] Look, son,
[53.16] you have tried to deal
with Arooj with strictness,
[56.60] she will not listen to you
with strictness
[59.76] but if you give her love
and attention,
[62.68] you will be able to control her
[64.84] and Mehreen is in the
same condition.
[70.08] So what do you want?
[72.56] Should I start loving
Arooj and her mother?
[76.24] Don’t,
[78.04] but just pretend to be
the way that
[80.20] they are sure you love
them a lot,
[86.80] they should believe that
you have changed
[89.68] and you cannot live without them,
[91.92] you love both of them a lot
[94.96] and as soon as you
get a chance,
[97.28] just get the sign on
all the documents.
[101.64] Trust me, son,
[103.24] as soon as all the documents
get signed,
[106.20] I will kick both the mother
and daughter
[107.92] out of this house.
[110.60] Hmm,
[113.24] great idea.
[116.32] But do you think
I will be able to do all that?
[119.96] I don’t think,
[121.36] I am sure you will do it.
[125.28] Son,
[126.88] it’s a problem for just a few days,
[129.44] then there will just be happiness,
[131.32] all this would just be ours.
[180.64] Now you understand
[183.28] how you were made the
heir of the entire property ...
[185.56] ...and business after Arooj
went missing?
[197.40] I will go mad.
[199.16] No.
[200.72] You don’t have to get mad,
[202.20] you need to act very sanely.
[207.24] Arooj is a very clever girl,
[209.64] she is also the heir to the
entire business and property.
[212.60] But she is my wife.
[214.00] She is Mehreen’s daughter,
[219.24] now that the reality
is in front of you,
[221.64] don’t expect anything good
from Mehreen as well,
[231.52] and Arooj
[233.36] will stand with her mother
in this situation.
[298.72] But do you know
[301.36] Waqar put everything in
Arooj’s name,
[306.12] Idrees got nothing.
[309.12] Mom, I know all this.
[314.20] Talk about the future.
[315.52] If you know then also know that
[317.36] 4 factories,
[320.40] we have a farmhouse
in Hyderabad,
[325.64] we have 3 more houses
apart from this house
[332.36] and a lot of other things.
[338.36] If Arooj goes away,
[340.76] all this will go with her.
[351.84] Look, Salman,
[353.68] I have no interest in Arooj,
[356.20] and you don’t either,
[374.20] if not today but tomorrow
[375.44] you will have
a second marriage
[382.52] but son,
[384.52] what will happen to us
if we lose all this,
[392.00] just think that.
[398.32] So what do you think
[400.32] she will give all this
to us easily?
[405.92] Not to us,
[410.40] to you.
[415.84] I have a plan.
[417.52] Come here, sit down.
[560.24] I and Idrees have given Salman
[562.36] greed for the money and property
[574.44] but he is not such a person.
[586.24] He is very egoistic and obstinate,
[598.80] he can change his decision
at any given point.
[612.08] I and Idrees will have
to be very careful,
[625.60] we have to take it out
of Salman’s mind that
[628.88] all this belongs to Arooj.
[643.52] If Salman won’t support
what’s wrong,
[647.60] our plan can go sideways.
[658.28] No, no,
[660.44] I won’t give up that easily,
[666.52] I have worked hard for it for years,
[676.40] only what I want is
going to happen.
[704.72] I am stuck in a weird
confusion.
[707.60] What happened?
[709.48] You know it.
[711.44] What happened right now,
my friend?
[713.44] I don’t know, dude,
[715.52] I am getting irritated
by everyone,
[718.08] I feel everyone is the
reason for my destruction.
[722.68] Salman, the same CD is
stuck in your mind though
[725.60] you have already discussed
this issue with me.
[728.76] Yes, by the way, you are right,
[731.56] what do I have to do with
Arooj and her property?
[735.56] So that’s the thing, I get it.
[740.52] Mom and Dad say that
all of this is mine,
[743.00] which is wrong.
[745.56] You know that better than
me, Salman
[748.60] and as far as fair dealing
is concerned,
[750.84] the whole business community
gives your example.
[755.08] Dude, but I won’t be able to do this.
[757.36] Salman, do you know,
[759.36] I have always learned
one thing from you,
[761.92] just follow that.
[765.96] What things?
[768.20] Let the matter go.
[777.60] Whenever there
will come a point
[779.84] that you will have to make
some decisions,
[782.80] you can tell me
[795.04] and if you don’t tell me that thing,
[798.12] I will get it.
[853.64] I have decided,
[856.64] I will divorce Arooj.
[861.96] Your decision is absolutely right.
[864.96] This is what should
happen to Arooj,
[867.04] she deserves it.
[872.84] I agree with your decision,
son.
[880.32] But you will not divorce
Arooj right now.
[884.68] Just wait for a while.
[889.16] Why?
[891.68] Why should I wait?
[896.40] I hate her.
[897.92] I know
[899.96] but do you know that
[902.68] Waqar had put everything
in Arooj’s name,
[910.00] Idrees didn’t get anything.
[998.52] We won’t go away from here.
[1001.76] And why should we go?
[1006.68] So? what will we do?
[1009.40] Don’t you remember
[1010.92] what you said to me?
[1012.40] This house, property, business,
[1015.12] all this is mine,
[1017.60] so when everything
belongs to us,
[1019.08] why should we leave?
[1022.64] These people won’t
let us live here.
[1024.80] How wouldn’t they?
[1027.44] Doing that is not in their control.
[1030.84] Nothing like that will happen.
[1034.76] Yes,
[1037.04] you are right.
[1044.88] But there is just one problem.
[1049.52] Uncle, Aunt, and Salman have
captured everything.
[1083.24] Did you call me?
[1085.80] Yes, Arooj,
[1089.12] I thought a lot about it,
[1100.56] brother Idrees and
sister-in-law Shaista,
[1105.16] when you were born,
[1107.64] they used to hate you
ever since your birth.
[1114.00] But
[1115.52] what did I do to them
at that time?
[1119.60] I and Waqar didn’t
have a child,
[1132.84] then you came into this world,
[1135.60] which means, the heir of
Waqar’s all the belongings.
[1148.80] Waqar put all his belongings
in your name,
[1164.88] ever since then,
they hate you,
[1175.04] they are your enemies.
[1181.28] If Dad put everything
in my name,
[1185.00] there must be some
agreement
[1187.56] or a stamp paper or
something that was signed.
[1193.84] Yes,
[1197.92] papers were there,
[1200.04] they were definitely there,
[1212.52] they must be kept somewhere,
[1215.32] let me check.
[1240.00] Madam Jr, don’t worry,
[1248.32] you just don’t worry,
[1251.88] Why?
[1255.84] because
[1258.16] Sir Sr and Begum Sahiba
[1262.68] are very greedy people,
[1270.32] yes, everything in this
house belongs to you,
[1279.44] they won’t ever let you
go off their hands.
[1335.72] I thought I would tell
you myself but
[1341.20] you promised me that you
[1344.60] would help me find
my parents.
[1349.96] Forgive it as my mistake
[1355.88] How can you be such
stone-hearted?
[1358.76] She loves you so much,
[1360.56] do you know
[1361.44] she hasn’t slept for the
past two nights, she…
[1362.88] So what should I do?
[1366.52] I am not responsible
for feeling pity on anyone.
[1369.80] Salman,
[1374.00] she is not someone,
[1379.40] she has given you love
for the past 25 years,
[1384.72] she is your mother
and you,
[1387.08] you are calling her
Aunt Mehreen today?
[1406.40] Do you feel peaceful?
[1411.60] Very much.
[1419.20] Do you know, Mom,
[1422.08] when I come to you,
[1425.44] I forget all my problems.
[1432.16] After all my son is my life.
[1443.48] My son is my soul.
[1470.64] I wasn’t your son,
[1475.80] but all your control and wishes
[1482.96] were from me.
[1497.56] This perfume,
[1500.28] this is your favorite, right?
[1504.68] So then, fine,
[1507.80] that is what I will put.
[1512.68] My plan will become easier if I apply this.
[1528.80] Sir Jr, did you call me?
[1545.92] I am sorry, Wasai.
[1556.12] Don’t worry,
[1559.52] I spoke to you strictly last night
[1567.12] and I am embarrassed for that.
[1571.20] No, no, Sir Jr,
[1573.60] that is not needed,
[1580.88] you are the owner of this house
[1584.44] and I am just a maid.
[1589.48] I never considered you as
a maid of this house,
[1598.24] I didn’t even treat my mother
and wife nicely.
[1609.76] Okay, tell me,
[1612.56] where is Arooj?
[1615.64] She is in that room.
[1621.16] What do you mean by that room?
[1622.64] Umm..
[1623.80] In Aunt Mehreen’s room?
[1630.08] So just call her Madam Sr,
[1635.96] she is yours in fact,
[1638.44] she is the Madam Sr of this house.
[1646.64] Okay, I will go meet her, in fact,
[1650.52] I also have to apologize to her.
[1659.48] You may go, I am coming.
[1661.76] Okay Sir Jr.
[1684.00] You are the reason behind
Arooj being in this house,
[1688.40] you are important even
for Mehreen.,
[1691.88] that’s why you are
the only one
[1694.04] who can take this entire
property from Arooj.
[1700.64] But how?
[1702.32] With love,
[1704.84] attention, passion.
[1708.52] Look, son,
[1709.56] you have tried to deal
with Arooj with strictness,
[1712.84] she will not listen to you
with strictness
[1716.08] but if you give her love
and attention,
[1718.92] you will be able to control her
[1721.36] and Mehreen is in the
same condition.
[1726.40] So what do you want?
[1728.96] Should I start loving Arooj
and her mother?
[1732.52] Don’t,
[1734.44] but just pretend to be the way
[1736.52] that they are sure
you love them a lot,
[1760.24] they should believe that
[1762.00] you have changed
[1763.16] and you cannot live without them,
[1765.48] you love both of them a lot
[1768.36] and as soon as you get a chance,
[1770.80] just get sign on all
the documents.
[1775.08] Trust me, son,
[1776.92] as soon as all the documents
get signed,
[1779.68] I will kick both the mother
and daughter
[1781.40] out of this house.
[1784.16] Hmm,
[1786.68] great idea.
[1789.88] But do you think
I will be able to do all that?
[1793.40] I don’t think,
[1794.92] I am sure you will do it.
[1799.00] Son,
[1800.40] it’s a problem for just
a few days,
[1803.08] then there will just be happiness,
[1804.96] all this would just be ours.
[1853.40] Good acting, Salman,
[1856.12] very good acting.
[1896.84] where did the documents go?
[1898.36] I kept them here somewhere.
[1900.76] Where did I keep them,
[1901.40] why can’t I find them?
[1902.72] Why are you tiring yourself?
[1904.72] We will find it some other time,
[1906.16] and anyway…
[1907.08] Anyway what?
[1908.88] You are extremely foolish.
[1916.24] Let me get the proof of your
ownership once
[1918.28] and see
[1919.04] how they bow down
in front of you.
[1925.20] Can’t we treat someone nicely
[1928.40] and make them ours?
[1930.88] We can, Arooj
[1932.60] but at least there is no
hope from them.
[1947.68] where are they kept?
[1949.84] They are definitely
kept somewhere.
[1960.72] I will go and check the
cupboard once again.
[1982.88] Mom’s condition is very bad,
Wasai.
[1986.88] She is suffering from
intense mental stress.
[1991.56] The one who has ruled
all her life
[1996.28] and now all this,
[2004.24] it is not tolerated.
[2008.96] Did Salman misbehave
a lot with Mom?
[2014.92] She has never been sad
about anyone except Sir Jr.
[2026.32] It has been so many years,
[2029.36] I have only seen this.
[2037.12] How would thinking help,
Madam Jr?
