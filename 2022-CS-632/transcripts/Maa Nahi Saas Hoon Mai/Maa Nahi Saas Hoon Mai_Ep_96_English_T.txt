[25.32] Take this file with you,
when you go.
[32.68] Hey, they are some 
twenty-five-year-old papers.
[35.68] How long do you have them for?
[37.24] For twenty five years.
[39.52] When Waqar had put everything
 in Areej’s name,
[42.68] that’s the day I took out this file 
from the cupboard.
[47.44] You plan for the future, Shaista.
[49.92] You knew we would need them one day.
[52.88] I had kept all this safe.
[55.04] If you were there,
[56.36] we would have been living in 
a cottage instead of this home.
[58.68] No, that is not true.
[60.92] What do we have to do 
about these?
[62.12] You have to give these papers 
to the lawyer.
[65.04] He will redo them.
[66.80] I have spoken to Salman,
[68.72] he will coax Arooj and
get her to sign it,
[71.96] and also give her 
thumb impression.
[74.60] You made a great plan.
[76.16] I will talk to the lawyer today.
[77.96] You have to do it today.
[79.16] You know about Salman’s mood, 
it can change at any time.
[82.28] If he gets angry at something 
in future,
[84.20] then everything will be ruined.
[86.52] Got it?
[87.48] Fine, I will go. Okay. 
Goodbye.
[106.60] I am the owner of this business, 
property, wealth
[114.60] and I know this well.
[120.84] So, it is my advice to you is that
stop dreaming about it.
[128.08] It is only a matter of me 
going to the court.
[132.76] I will destroy your twenty five 
year old game,
[139.12] within minutes.
[143.08] So, the meaning of all 
that I said is
[146.92] that stay away from the life of my 
husband, my mother and daughter.
[152.80] This has your betterment.
[163.84] Now everything will be fine.
[168.00] Everything.
[220.56] I am not from amongst those wives
[222.48] who sits to cry and crib seeing
 their husbands
[227.04] in a relationship with 
another woman.
[234.96] I have a young son,
[237.44] now he will deal with 
all these matters.
[241.68] Salman?
[246.16] Why are you involving Salman
 in all this?
[248.40] He has to do a lot of work 
in the business.
[251.56] Why do you worry?
[256.52] You just said that,
[259.00] that woman is lying.
[260.32] Yes, she…
[262.04] So, we will see.
[264.44] Salman is coming home 
from the office.
[272.56] Pray that, that woman turns out 
to be a liar.
[296.72] Nawaz, come to my room.
[322.04] Yes, boss, you called me?
[323.48] Yes.
[325.00] Fix my appointment with 
advocate Mr. Ahsan.
[329.92] Boss, why do you need an advocate?
[333.48] Do as I tell you, don’t think so much
 in my matters!
[339.64] Sorry boss.
[341.76] Now, leave.
[355.48] I am thinking that Salman doesn’t 
like Arooj at all.
[359.48] Yes.
[362.24] So?
[364.96] The way he left upstairs in anger,
[367.52] and he is agreeing to us,
[374.32] why don’t we drag the mother and 
daughter out of the home and we rule here.
[381.76] You say weird things.
[384.72] What benefit will we have 
with these two leaving?
[388.60] All this will be temporarily ours.
[392.24] Don’t forget,
[394.12] all this is still in the name of 
the cunning Arooj.
[398.92] So, what do we do?
[402.72] First
[404.16] let all these things be put 
in our name.
[408.80] After that, I don’t care if the mother
and daughter die.
[489.80] Salman,
[491.88] I am your mother.
[494.56] Don’t hit me.
[497.40] Don’t hit me.
[499.80] Don’t hit me. Salman, 
I am your mother…
[502.88] Mama, no one is hitting you.
[504.76] What happened to you mama?
[505.80] Don’t hit me.
Don’t hit me.
[508.56] He is hitting me.
[509.84] No one is hitting you.
[511.24] He was hitting me.
He was hitting me.
[514.60] You saw a bad dream.
[516.84] Yes.
[519.76] I saw a really bad dream.
[522.20] He was hitting me.
[523.76] No one is hitting you.
I am here.
[526.96] Your daughter is with you.
[529.40] Yes,
[531.68] you are my daughter.
[533.52] You are my daughter.
[535.24] But, my son.
[538.92] My Salman,
[540.76] he was hitting me.
[542.08] No one is hitting you,
you have seen a dream.
[544.88] He was hitting me. 
Come, lie down.
[562.04] Younger madam, tea.
[567.40] Did Salman go to the office?
[569.96] No,
[571.32] he went to elder madam’s room.
[586.36] There is no need to worry.
[589.72] Young master is really embarrassed
on his behaviour.
[631.04] It is hard to believe it.
[635.40] When trust is broken once,
[639.96] it doesn’t get fixed again.
[646.16] She didn’t even drink her tea.
[728.04] I made a big mistake.
[730.96] I don’t know what happens to me.
[733.52] I made a big mistake.
Please forgive me.
[738.28] Okay come on, sit up.
[740.56] You are going to the office, right?
 Your clothes will get ruined.
[742.52] No, I will not get up 
till you forgive me.
[745.64] Salman, come on,
sit here first.
[749.28] First tell me, 
will you forgive me?
[752.04] We will talk. 
Come on, sit.
[774.64] Look Salman,
[777.08] let’s forget whatever happened.
[783.12] But you make a promise to me?
[785.88] What promise? 
I will accept it.
[790.72] You will not say anything to Arooj.
[797.12] If you two live with love, 
then I will like it.
[803.72] Even Arooj wants this
[806.80] and now she has become
the mother of your daughter.
[812.36] You are right.
[815.48] I promise,
[818.20] I will not say anything to her. 
She will forgive me, right?
[821.88] She will. 
She surely will
[861.44] See Arooj,
[863.60] I had told you,
[866.84] my Salman is really good at heart.
[877.92] He has realized his mistake.
[918.32] I am really sorry Arooj.
[922.24] It is my mistake. I admit this.
[946.36] I am really sorry.
[948.16] I shouldn’t have done all this.
[951.16] I accept my mistake.
[952.96] If you want you can punish me.
[954.32] What?
Hit me. I made a mistake.
[955.56] What are you doing? Leave me.
[958.72] Look, child, Arooj.
[966.28] Forgive Salman for my sake.
[998.04] Mama,
[1000.24] you know everything, right?
[1004.56] I know it all.
[1006.76] But maybe you are forgetting.
[1014.48] Salman only means happiness 
for both of us.
[1034.68] Both our happiness.
[1046.20] Please,
[1047.92] forgive him.
[1101.52] Fine.
[1104.88] I have no complaints from you.
[1147.84] Mom,
[1149.68] Arooj forgave me, right?
[1152.12] Yes.
[1154.36] She did.
[1156.32] I know her.
[1188.04] I will not give you a chance 
to complain in future.
[1192.96] Not me,
[1195.08] Arooj.
[1197.60] I won’t.
[1211.56] Okay, I will go to the office. 
Yes.
[1256.80] Do you find peace?
[1262.00] A lot of peace.
[1269.60] Do you know, mom,
[1272.48] when I come to you
[1275.92] I forget all my difficulties.
[1282.56] After all, my son is my life. 
Hmm?
[1293.08] My son is my life.
[1330.20] Hey wife of mine, where are you?
I am getting late.
[1335.08] Here is your tea. 
Thank you.
[1341.84] Idrees.
[1344.72] Idrees,
[1345.96] how long will I live in this 
small home?
[1350.84] And now I am not going to agree
 with this useless love.
[1355.52] You, yourself are living in 
such a big home
[1358.00] with your wife and son, 
that too with luxuries.
[1362.12] You tell me,
[1363.92] do you want to go and 
live in that home?
[1366.16] Really?
[1367.76] Can this really happen?
[1370.04] Can this happen?
[1372.16] Wife of mine, it is going to 
happen in a few days.
[1375.80] I don’t understand anything.
[1378.20] Hey, I told you I am coming 
from the lawyer.
[1381.32] Shaista and Salman are thinking,
[1384.00] I got the papers made 
in Salman’s name.
[1387.28] Then?
[1388.48] No one will even find out,
as soon as Arooj signs,
[1391.96] everything will be mine.
[1393.60] That’s it, then I will leave Shaista.
[1395.64] I have had enough of her, 
she has grown old.
[1399.48] I know that.
[1401.88] After all, I am in your life.
[1406.32] Yes, that is true.
[1408.88] Hey, I have to get to the office.
[1411.00] I cannot let Salman talk to 
the lawyer directly at any cost.
[1414.40] Or else the secret will be out.
[1415.72] Yes, fine.
[1416.80] I will update you on everything. 
Okay. Goodbye.
[1420.64] Goodbye.
[1451.96] I searched for you all around.
[1454.84] Why did you leave the home 
and go?
[1457.00] I had told you to wait, 
you left everything and went.
[1460.56] You know everyone at home 
is calling me a liar,
[1462.68] that I am lying and 
no one came.
[1465.48] You should have thought 
a little about my respect.
[1468.32] I was doing everything 
for your good, and…
[1471.72] yes, Shanzay.
[1473.44] I have found Mussarat,
[1474.92] I am talking to her. 
I will call you shortly.
[1480.84] It is good
[1482.68] that I got rid of Arooj’s advice.
[1486.68] Now, I will live a life of luxuries.
[1572.76] How can you be so stonehearted?
[1575.76] She loves you. 
You know,
[1578.40] she has not slept for two nights 
because of you…
[1579.88] So, what do I do?
[1583.52] I have not taken up the responsibility
of having mercy on anyone.
[1586.56] Salman,
[1591.60] she is not anyone.
[1597.16] She has given you love for
twenty five years.
[1604.32] She is your mother and
[1606.76] you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen today.
[1610.16] Okay.
[1612.72] So you tell me.
[1615.16] Tell me,
[1616.96] if I don’t call her aunt Mehreen, 
then what do I call her?
[1624.60] I too have been brought up 
by someone else,
[1631.52] but I still consider her my mother, 
till today.
[1635.20] It is not necessary that I think
the same way as you.
[1648.00] See Arooj,
[1650.24] I had told you,
[1653.48] my Salman is really good at heart.
[1660.16] He has realized his mistake.
[1680.12] I am really sorry Arooj.
[1684.04] It is my mistake. I admit this.
[1692.84] I am really sorry.
[1695.00] I shouldn’t have done all this.
[1697.88] I accept my mistake.
[1699.60] If you want you can punish me.
[1700.92] What?
[1701.80] Hit me. I made a mistake. 
What are you doing? Leave me.
[1741.00] Mama.
[1754.00] I feel,
[1757.16] you shouldn’t have a lot of hopes
from Salman.
[1761.32] What do you want to say?
[1766.16] Meaning,
[1768.96] he can say and do anything.
[1773.08] What do you want to say?
[1790.24] I know you love Salman a lot.
[1803.52] But don’t keep so much 
expectations from him,
[1807.64] that you feel sad.
[1810.20] Arooj,
[1812.92] child, you became 
Salman’s wife later.
[1816.80] I brought him up.
[1827.32] I know him much better than you.
[1878.76] Look, child, Arooj.
[1881.28] Forgive Salman for my sake.
[1897.20] Mama,
[1899.68] you know everything, right?
[1903.84] I know it all.
[1906.08] But maybe you are forgetting.
[1910.36] Salman only means happiness 
for both of us.
[1922.16] Both our happiness.
[1928.48] Please,
[1930.12] forgive him.
[1935.48] I don’t know why,
[1939.16] I am unable to believe this changed
behaviour of Salman
[1950.56] or maybe I am thinking too much.
[1957.68] It is possible that it is only 
my imagination.
[1984.08] What are you thinking?
