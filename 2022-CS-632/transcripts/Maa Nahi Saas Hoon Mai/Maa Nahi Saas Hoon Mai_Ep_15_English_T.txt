[43.28] Hey, little madam, you.
[48.48] Don’t stop these tears.
[51.88] Let them flow.
[54.76] It will lessen the burden on your heart.
[57.84] Little madam, that…
[59.92] I heard everything. 
I saw everything, Wasai.
[63.44] You don’t need to say anything.
[69.52] Don’t worry,
[71.60] everything will be fine.
[74.88] No madam,
[77.60] nothing will be fine.
[80.72] All my life has passed,
[84.08] first the step mother’s injustice
[89.20] and this druggie husband.
[93.96] I don’t know how much further 
God will test, Wasai.
[102.40] All will be fine, Wasai.
[105.04] You have served the people of this family;
[109.12] you will get good from here.
[113.88] I know younger madam.
[117.72] This home had given me a safe haven,
[121.52] or else God knows where and in 
what condition Wasai would have been today.
[130.52] Don’t worry, Wasai, I am with you.
[134.52] Nothing will happen.
[153.84] I was just missing you,
[155.96] I thought I would come meet you 
for a while.
[158.72] You did good child,
[160.64] but why did you send the car back?
[164.76] The driver will come, mama.
[175.20] What are you thinking now?
[179.08] Mama, aunt Mehreen is Salman’s mother.
[183.64] The intensity for her love for 
Salman is understandable,
[189.72] but aunt Shaista’s love for Salman
[193.08] and that too with so much intensity,
[196.28] I didn’t understand this.
[199.44] Child, he is the son of that home,
[203.04] so they can love him intensely.
[207.00] I used to think the same thing earlier,
[210.12] but mama, aunt Shaista loving 
Salman more than a mother,
[216.48] and she doesn’t take a step back 
to move forward in this war of love.
[222.32] I am surprised about this.
[225.32] Urooj, you are worried for no reason,
[227.68] and there is nothing surprising, child.
[229.56] It is surprising mama,
[231.28] how can someone love someone 
else’s child so much.
[235.56] That too more than the mother.
[239.60] Impossible, mama.
[245.44] Okay, your tea is getting cold.
[247.88] Have your tea.
[254.72] The picture in your room,
[257.64] in which you have a child in your arms,
[260.08] who is that?
[263.96] That is Salman.
[266.36] He was this young
[268.88] since the time I brought him up.
[274.36] That is why I love him so much.
[278.80] Meaning,
[282.16] you didn’t have a child of your own.
[289.64] Yes.
[292.84] Yes,
[295.56] think that, child.
[352.72] Do you know, Salman,
[355.88] this sea drives me crazy.
[360.20] Really?
[362.00] That is something wrong.
[364.88] If such a beautiful wife of mine goes mad,
[368.92] what will happen to me?
[370.32] Salman. 
Just kidding.
[382.60] Just a second.
[386.52] Hello.
[389.48] Hi Alizay, how are you?
[392.76] Yeah, long time.
[396.56] What?
[398.32] When are you coming to Pakistan?
[400.76] Tomorrow?
[403.16] That’s amazing.
[407.64] Yes, fine, then,
 you will stay at my place.
[411.92] In fact, I will pick you from 
the airport tomorrow.
[416.76] Alright,
[418.84] take care. See you.
[424.32] Who is this Alizay?
I never heard of her before.
[428.76] Alizay?
[431.20] She became my friend 
in university in America.
[434.16] Actually, we studied together 
in university there.
[437.92] She is an interesting girl.
[440.40] You will like her when you meet her.
[444.32] Okay, so she is coming tomorrow.
[446.92] Yes, she is coming tomorrow.
[448.96] I will go to pick her up from the airport.
[546.20] You have not changed at all,
[548.84] in fact, you have become 
even more beautiful.
[553.56] So you just picked me,
[556.32] we just met
[558.20] and you are flirting with me 
as soon as you met me, Salman.
[562.40] I am not flirting with you.
[564.68] You are my friend.
[566.28] I am giving you a compliment.
[567.68] Thank you.
[572.16] But you have changed.
[574.36] You completely forgot me.
[578.36] You never called, nor did you ever think 
of visiting the US,
[583.24] to meet me. No. Why?
[587.76] You know how occupied 
I am in the business.
[592.28] Yes, you have a business empire, 
I know that.
[597.88] Yes.
[600.28] But I have worked really hard 
to setup this empire.
[604.40] I am sure
[606.20] and I am proud of you. 
Thank you.
[613.12] Karachi has changed so much, man. 
I mean…
[617.80] nothing is the same anymore. 
Everything has changed.
[622.52] Obviously, when you come 
after ten years,
[625.92] you will see the change.
[627.40] Yeah, almost ten years.
[630.20] Long time.
[632.88] By the way, I wanted to say 
something to you.
[634.64] Yes?
[640.04] Had you not gotten married Salman,
[645.52] I would have married you.
[648.40] Wait. What?
[652.36] Come on, I am just kidding man. 
I am joking.
[656.40] What was there to be so serious in this?
[659.36] I mean, what problem do you men have?
[663.16] Someone didn’t even start talking 
about marriage,
[665.52] and you started day dreaming. 
Like seriously.
[668.92] Excuse me. I am not day dreaming.
[671.16] And you are….
[672.60] Really beautiful?
Not at all.
[675.16] You are really ill-mannered.
[677.08] Thank you for the compliment, 
by the way.
[680.08] I am getting such good compliments 
as soon as I came back. Nice.
[686.00] So, tell me more.
How was your flight?
[689.04] The flight was really long. 
I am tired.
[692.52] I will rest, I will be okay.
[694.36] No issues, you are in Karachi,
[696.60] I will take you around a lot. 
Oh, you have to.
[713.04] Sit. 
You must be aunt Mehreen, right?
[716.88] I could recognize you easily
[719.52] because Salman used to talk about 
you so much in America,
[723.80] that my mother is like this, 
my mama is like that.
[728.64] He loves me after all.
[731.64] Exactly,
[733.24] that’s why I had a very clear picture 
of you in my mind.
[737.08] Mom, you leave her, 
she will just keep on talking.
[740.36] Yes, so why should I not talk?
[742.76] It is good to talk.
[744.64] Yes, yes, absolutely. why not.
[746.96] Salman, go get fresh.
[750.60] Yes, mom.
[751.52] You are a really good mother.
[754.00] You care a lot about Salman.
[757.96] I just have one son.
[766.28] Greetings.
[771.64] Greetings.
[773.68] By the way, Alizay, meet my wife,
[777.08] Urooj.
[783.76] Urooj, she is my friend, Alizay.
[791.36] Hi Urooj.
[793.72] You people talk,
[795.12] I will ask Wasai and 
get some food arranged.
[799.12] Arranged? What is that?
[801.48] Meaning, she will arrange food.
[804.04] Oh. 
Are you not hungry?
[806.48] Man, I am starving Salman,
I am so hungry.
[810.24] I will arrange lunch.
[813.48] By the way, I will tell you one thing,
[816.56] as long as Alizay is in Pakistan, 
she will stay at our home.
[824.24] No, no, man.
[825.60] Don’t bother, please, 
I will do something.
[828.44] See, what is this mom?
[830.76] Hey, Salman has said it, 
so you will have to stay.
[837.52] I will tell Wasai to fix the guest room.
[841.00] Wasai.
[842.32] Coming little madam.
[852.88] Yes.
[854.64] You come with me. 
Sure.
[859.68] Tell me more,
[861.96] what was going on in USA? 
What was your routine?
[865.64] Nothing. You tell me,
[867.64] you didn’t contact me after coming back.
Did you get really busy?
[924.08] Why are there three cups?
[927.48] We are two.
[930.64] Urooj is joining us shortly.
[937.20] By the way, Salman.
[942.56] I didn’t understand this decision of yours.
[952.44] What decision?
[954.76] Meaning,
[957.24] that as far as I know you,
[959.64] you are a really choosy man.
[961.88] You are really picky; 
you get everything you like.
[966.88] Then who did you marry?
[970.20] What do you mean?
[972.08] Salman, I mean,
[975.28] this girl is not your type.
[978.52] Why did you marry her?
[982.64] Alizay,
[985.28] don’t say anything about Urooj.
[989.80] She is my love.
[995.32] I married her out of love.
[1001.44] Yes, that’s surprising. How?
[1005.68] Can we leave this topic?
[1007.68] Shall we talk about something else?
[1011.76] I left it.
[1015.60] Tell me,
[1017.20] don’t you plan to get married? 
Do you like someone?
[1022.68] Handsome boys like you 
have this big issue.
[1028.64] They like hearing things about 
themselves.
[1033.36] Fine, I will tell you.
[1038.76] I had liked a boy.
[1045.64] I wanted to marry him.
[1052.96] He got married.
[1058.88] Such a stupid guy, right?
[1065.52] Alizay,
[1068.32] you have always been a good friend 
of mine, and you always will be.
[1076.52] I never looked at you that way,
[1080.44] and secondly, you know,
[1082.88] I could never have shifted to 
America leaving mama.
[1087.64] She would always come to meet me
after three to four months
[1091.32] and you know how possessive 
I was for her.
[1096.64] So, Salman,
[1099.20] you had rejected my love for your mama?
[1122.04] What is the matter? So much silence.
[1134.16] Yes,
[1139.60] the two of us were recalling the beautiful
times we spent in the US.
[1153.36] We just got lost in that.
[1169.44] Urooj, come sit.
[1177.56] Where were you? 
I was waiting for you.
[1181.28] I was in the kitchen.
[1182.84] We were reliving old memories.
[1185.64] University life.
[1188.64] Those were the golden days of life.
[1273.96] The two of us were recalling the beautiful
times we spent in the US.
[1284.00] We just got lost in that.
[1339.04] what is the matter, Urooj?
[1347.28] You have not slept till now. 
Are you not sleepy?
[1358.84] I find this Alizay weird.
[1367.36] What do you mean?
[1369.48] Why do you find her weird?
[1376.08] She talks a little too much,
[1377.96] and when she starts talking,
she continues.
[1380.84] And she talks without thinking, 
she doesn’t know what to say.
[1384.56] Yes, that is true, Alizay talks a lot.
[1388.52] Actually, she is confident and bold too.
[1393.64] Yes,
[1395.48] I agree with the last thing you said.
[1399.80] She is not just bold,
she is really bold.
[1407.08] Why do I feel that you didn’t like 
Alizay that much?
[1416.92] You thought right, Salman.
[1420.96] I don’t like people who interfere 
in the lives of others.
[1425.92] What did she do?
[1430.32] I just want to say
[1433.04] that there is difference in being 
confident and overconfident.
[1439.84] You highlighted the right difference.
[1442.48] For your kind information, 
Alizay is really straightforward.
[1450.56] Yes.
[1457.36] She is a little too forward,
[1463.48] that maybe you don’t see.
[1517.28] Why are you not drinking juice Alizay?
[1519.72] Yes.
[1521.96] You know
[1524.76] as much time as Salman lived in US,
[1528.08] he used to live with me, 
he used to live in my home.
[1532.24] Salman had told me.
[1536.76] Yes,
[1539.04] how could I forget he shares 
everything with you.
[1545.36] Obviously,
[1547.28] if Salman doesn’t talk to his mother, 
then who will he talk to?
[1551.32] Yes.
[1555.24] By the way, I am surprised aunty.
[1557.76] I am actually very surprised.
[1560.60] I mean,
[1562.12] how much you and Salman 
resemble each other.
[1566.84] You are each other’s copy.
[1570.24] You know he would always talk 
about you.
[1574.24] He would only talk about you.
[1581.40] I feel that he cannot live without you.
[1589.56] By the way, Alizay,
[1592.52] I like you.
[1599.00] Thank you, aunty.
[1601.84] I too really like you.
[1604.32] Such a lovely person.
[1609.44] By the way,
[1611.88] I just got a thought in my mind.
[1615.76] Salman has been married for long, right?
[1620.56] You must want that your grandchildren 
go around the house.
[1627.20] I mean,
[1628.84] I feel Salman’s children will be 
really pretty, right?
[1635.12] Lovely like Salman.
[1640.48] I can’t wait to see them.
[1686.92] Urooj, child.
[1689.48] Why are you standing here alone?
[1693.08] Just like that.
[1694.44] Are you too also thinking the same thing
I have been thinking since yesterday.
[1699.76] I didn’t understand.
[1701.64] Even I don’t understand,
[1703.88] Salman’s friend Alizay came home 
suddenly and then she stayed too.
[1709.12] They have such close friendship?
[1714.04] I don’t think all this is right.
[1716.12] I don’t think this is right,
[1719.28] but maybe we are mistaken.
[1721.96] It is possible we are thinking possible.
[1727.28] It is possible.
[1734.20] But child, remember one thing.
[1740.32] Salman really loves you a lot,
[1744.52] and the biggest proof of this is
[1746.92] that he married you despite 
Mehreen’s opposition,
[1751.28] and that was not easy for Salman.
[1757.12] You are right about that, aunt.
[1781.92] By the way, I just got a thought in my mind.
[1786.04] Salman has been married for long, right?
[1790.84] You must want that your grandchildren
go around the house. I mean,
[1799.08] I feel Salman’s children will be
really pretty, right?
[1805.48] Lovely like Salman.
[1811.24] This Urooj has entered in the life 
of my son forcefully.
[1818.04] I couldn’t stop her from coming,
[1822.24] but I can drag her out.
[1828.36] It has been so long,
[1831.00] Urooj still hasn’t been able 
to become a mother.
[1834.16] Now I have to tell Salman,
[1837.28] that keeping such a girl in his life 
is really useless.
[1844.76] You need a child,
[1847.96] and I want my heir.
[1852.80] My grandson.
[1892.16] Salman’s friend Alizay came home 
suddenly and then she stayed too.
[1897.56] They have such close friendship?
[1902.44] I don’t think all this is right.
[1911.28] Am I getting really disturbed 
because of Salman and Alizay.
[1918.68] No, no,
[1920.44] Salman cannot do that.
[1924.04] Maybe I am doubting him wrongly.
[1933.96] But, aunt Shaista is 
an experienced woman.
[1945.68] She too felt the same thing, 
that I felt.
[1956.08] This means, this thing is there 
somewhere in some form.
[1966.08] I pray to God
[1968.68] that this doubt of mine, remains a doubt,
[1974.56] and this thought dies its own death.
[1992.52] This is really disappointing.
[1994.80] You have still not emailed 
the SA group of companies?
[1998.52] Sir, I have already informed them.
[2000.68] So?
[2001.76] Where is the result?
[2004.04] Our project is getting delayed because 
of their raw material being late.
[2007.76] You send them a final email that 
if there is a delay from them now,
[2011.32] then we will cancel their agreement.
[2013.88] Right, sir.
[2023.00] You may go now. 
Right sir.
[2030.84] Yes, Urooj, go ahead.
[2032.84] Yes, Salman,
[2035.84] I wanted to talk to you about 
something important.
[2039.20] What do you want to talk about? 
Go ahead.
[2044.60] Salman,
[2050.12] you and Alizay…
[2053.28] I mean taking her informality has led
to a question in my head.
[2061.56] What question?
[2067.64] When you two were in America,
[2071.12] then you used to share the same 
apartment, right?
[2075.52] Yes, we used to share an apartment, 
why?
[2080.72] Look Salman,
[2083.12] earlier, I didn’t even know 
if there is a girl named Alizay,
[2087.72] nor did I know that you used 
to share an apartment with her.
[2092.48] Because Urooj, Alizay was not 
that important for me,
[2096.08] so I forgot to tell you,
[2098.72] and by the way, her mama too lived 
with us in the apartment.
[2106.88] Okay fine.
[2108.60] Not okay,
[2110.36] because you are doubting me.
[2117.28] Urooj, Alizay is just a friend of mine,
[2121.08] and nothing else.
[2125.52] Okay fine, you do your work.
[2128.92] I am sorry, I disturbed you.
[2132.16] Goodbye.
[2134.48] Goodbye.
[2145.04] I pray to God that whatever 
Salman said is the truth.
[2177.88] What are you looking at, aunt?
[2181.36] I am looking for something,
[2183.88] but I don’t see it.
[2189.52] What?
[2191.36] I told you;
[2193.96] I am looking for something, 
but I don’t see it.
[2205.24] By the way,
[2207.20] something is going on in your head,
[2211.60] that I don’t see.
[2216.32] Anyway,
[2218.56] why do I care?
