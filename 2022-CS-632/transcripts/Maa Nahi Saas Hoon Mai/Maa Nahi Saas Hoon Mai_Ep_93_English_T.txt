[29.52] Dad, forget about this now.
[37.36] What Arooj did was wrong,
[44.28] and I'll ensure she faces
 the consequences.
[46.48] I promise.
[48.56] But my position in front 
of your mom is ruined
[52.24] Mom didn't take it seriously.
[56.08] Arooj has hurt me deeply,
 my son,
[65.48] especially
[66.12] with such an accusation 
at this point in life.
[92.20] Your phone is ringing,
 answer it.
[94.16] No issues,
[96.04] it is not important.
[98.96] Dad, don’t worry,
[103.36] now I am no longer the Salman
 who trusted Arooj blindly.
[113.40] Whatever she did,
[115.68] she will have to answer for it.
[121.76] Thank you, Salman.
[123.32] Thank you, son.
[135.36] You saved your father’s
 respect at this age in his life.
[142.40] Dad, your phone is ringing again.
[144.08] It must be an important call.
[145.32] You can answer it, I will leave.
[165.76] Yes, Musarrat?
[167.16] Idress, I met Arooj in the market.
[173.04] What? Again?
[177.44] I don’t know, I went for shopping.
[180.36] I don’t know where I found her,
[181.80] where did she saw me.
[190.80] She stopped me.
[192.44] She started questioning me.
[194.44] Thank God, her phone rang,
[195.92] and I got away from there.
[269.76] This has nothing to do 
with my victory or defeat.
[273.04] You have a second wife,
[274.84] keep her with respect,
[276.12] make a home,
[286.84] and also let me live
 my life peacefully.
[298.44] So, then you won, right?
[307.08] What is wrong, younger madam?
[309.48] Is everything okay?
[318.36] I hope everything will be fine soon.
[454.40] Did you not have shame keeping
 relations with a married man?
[459.56] Not relation, marriage.
[463.20] You are lying.
[467.28] You’re a home wrecker.
[472.48] I didn’t know.
[474.80] Idrees told me that
 he divorced his wife,
[477.72] he is single.
[483.48] and you believed him?
[486.20] If a man cries and asks 
a woman for sympathy,
[493.60] then the woman becomes 
helpless.
[497.80] I thought there is a man
 troubled by circumstances,
[501.48] a worn-out person,
[503.04] who needs support.
[505.68] What?
[508.08] He is still left to be worn-out.
[554.32] Why are you insisting?
[555.48] We are living a good life.
[557.48] I am telling you I will fix everything.
[559.16] Believe me.
[559.80] Enough!
[560.84] That’s it, Idrees.
[561.96] I don’t believe your lies
 and false promises.
[565.84] I want respect of our 
relation in the society.
[568.60] Hey, so you announced it?
[569.88] Stop it. Leave now.
[571.16] Why should I go?
[572.88] I will not go from here.
[574.52] I am your wife
[575.68] and I want the right of being your wife.
[578.04] Wife?
[579.12] Will you live your life quietly or else,
[580.92] you will suffer all your life.
[582.08] You will not be able to prove that
[583.04] we have been married.
[586.36] I doubted your actions earlier,
[589.40] but I thought that no,
[591.20] you are unable to take out time 
because of being busy at work.
[594.76] But when you ignored our son,
[597.88] that’s when I was sure that
[599.76] something is surely wrong.
[601.44] For this day,
[602.84] I had already taken out
 our wedding papers.
[608.16] Look, you are not understanding.
[609.72] You are listening to that Arooj.
[611.00] She is using you,
[612.04] so that she can take away
 all the wealth.
[613.92] Don’t you want that,
[614.72] me you and our child live 
a happy life.
[617.68] You want it or not? 
You want it, right?
[624.64] A woman is so weak
[632.56] and especially that woman,
[638.72] who is someone’s second wife.
[645.20] She always gets second priority.
[653.20] Even her children never 
get the first priority.
[666.16] Then, she takes support
 of reasoning,
[674.76] to save her fragile home 
and relationship.
[700.60] Sakeena....
[702.88] Lesten to me...
[722.40] I am not from amongst 
those wives,
[724.36] who sits down to cry
 seeing their husband ...
[727.68] ...in a relation with some
 other woman.
[734.92] I have a young son.
[737.32] Now he will deal
 with these matters.
[741.56] Salman?
[744.92] Why are you involving 
Salman in these matters,
[747.08] he has to do a lot of 
things in business.
[750.36] Why are you worried?
[754.08] You just said that woman is a liar.
[757.68] Yes, she…
[759.32] So, we will see.
[761.80] Salman is coming home 
from the office.
[768.68] Pray that woman 
turns out to be a liar.
[827.00] Hey,
[829.20] my beloved Arooj, come here.
[832.40] Yes?
[835.60] What happened?
[838.44] Did you meet Idrees’s
 second wife?
[844.44] Huh?
[846.00] And if you have not met her,
[851.48] then make someone else
 his second wife and bring her.
[855.96] You are an expert in such trickery.
[867.04] Aunt!
[868.40] I have not played any tricks,
[870.44] aunt. You can think 
what you want.
[872.96] Then, where is she?
[876.16] Where is my co-wife?
[880.40] You can say what you 
want to say to me, I will hear it.
[883.52] But believe me,
[886.08] aunt Musarrat is uncle’s 
second wife.
[888.68] shhhh...
[900.32] Don’t talk nonsense to me.
[907.16] Idrees cannot be anyone
 else’s other than me.
[927.28] You are mistaken.
[951.36] Madam, your tea.
[974.24] What is the matter, mom?
[975.08] You had called. Is everything fine?
[978.32] Son, she came,
[980.84] she sat here,
[981.92] and she left suddenly.
[985.24] What do you mean who sat here?
[988.76] Who?
[991.00] His second wife.
[998.92] Second wife?
[1006.16] What do you mean? 
What are you saying?
[1007.48] I don’t understand.
[1010.24] As soon as you left for office,
[1012.32] a woman came
[1014.60] and said she is his second wife.
[1016.76] Hey, she was lying. She was lying.
[1022.88] I don’t know
[1024.28] if she was speaking 
the truth or lying,
[1026.64] but she had wedding papers…
[1028.48] Hey, I said those were fake.
[1058.00] I have told you,
[1059.08] what relation will I have with 
another woman with you there?
[1061.28] And you got fooled by her.
[1064.48] If she was honest, then she 
would be sitting here.
[1067.12] Yes.
[1068.40] Whoever she was, honest or liar,
[1069.96] but why did she come here?
[1072.84] Son, only Arooj can tell us this.
[1078.36] What do you mean?
[1080.48] What does Arooj have 
to do with this matter?
[1083.20] Yes, Arooj called her here.
[1089.44] And she introduced her to me
[1091.88] as Mrs. Idrees Ahmad.
[1098.84] She is really cunning, son.
[1100.60] She knows that she can 
only take over the wealth
[1102.40] when there are misunderstandings 
between us
[1107.60] or else,
[1109.00] who do I have other 
than you or Shaista?
[1111.88] Huh?
[1166.24] Careful, Arooj.
[1171.00] Areej just slept.
[1184.84] What happened, Arooj?
[1187.24] What, mama?
[1189.36] No planning ever works for us.
[1194.04] I don’t understand anything, 
Arooj.
[1198.72] I made uncle Idrees’s 
second wife come
[1201.36] and stand in front of 
everyone here
[1203.12] and you see,
[1204.20] she changed in 
front of everyone.
[1214.24] She made me a criminal 
in everyone’s eyes instead.
[1218.96] Brother Idrees is a
 really cunning man.
[1229.24] He must have surely 
schemed something,
[1231.12] because of which that woman 
is running away from her right.
[1244.84] Yes, but
[1248.00] what do I do about Salman?
[1251.72] What did Salman do?
[1256.24] He wants that 
I apologize to his parents.
[1268.32] I will never apologize,
[1270.48] because those people 
are not worthy of it.
[1283.16] Doing this would be
 my insult, mama.
[1287.36] So, no one can force 
you either, Arooj.
[1299.08] You are my daughter,
[1300.76] and I am still alive right now.
[1310.32] I will break every hand 
that is extended towards you.
[1316.48] I am scared mama.
[1319.64] I don’t know what will happen.
[1322.84] Arooj, don’t worry, my love.
[1335.04] What my God wants will happen.
[1351.36] Wasai.
[1353.76] Wasai.
[1355.44] Make tea for madam 
Arooj and bring it.
[1447.60] Salman...
[1455.96] Story staring. I will call Idrees.
[1465.20] Hun
[1475.00] Where are you going?
[1477.08] Come, have a seat.
[1478.92] I have got tea made.
[1485.48] Shaista,
[1486.76] I am unable to look
 you in the eyes.
[1495.44] What does this mean?
[1499.96] Arooj has degraded
 in your eyes, in fact,
[1502.52] in my own eyes. Honestly.
[1514.24] Wasai.
[1520.56] Wasai.
[1521.60] Yes.
[1522.36] Yes, coming little master.
[1525.48] Yes?
[1528.00] Go, call Arooj.
[1530.64] Sure.
[1543.12] Salman son...
[1548.60] Now you can restore 
your father’s respect.
[1558.68] Nothing has happened 
to your respect.
[1562.56] You won’t get it Shaista.
[1564.48] At this point in my life,
[1565.88] I only have pride of my character,
[1568.60] Arooj even snatched that away.
[1570.32] Yes.
[1617.36] Younger madam,
[1620.36] little master is calling you.
[1623.60] Why?
[1626.20] I don’t know about that.
[1629.96] Where is Salman?
[1631.88] He is sitting in the
 lounge downstairs.
[1636.24] and who else is downstairs?
[1638.28] Elder sir, and madam.
[1648.84] Go and tell Salman,
[1651.44] whatever he wants 
to talk about
[1652.56] he should come 
upstairs and do it.
[1653.72] I won’t come.
[1656.36] Sure.
[1669.32] What happened?
[1672.24] Did you meet Idrees’s
 second wife?
[1676.52] And if you have not met her,
[1678.28] then make someone else his 
second wife and bring her.
[1682.24] You are an expert in 
such trickery.
[1689.60] Aunt,
[1690.96] I have not played any tricks,
[1693.00] aunt. You can think 
what you want.
[1695.32] Then, where is she?
[1698.56] Where is my co-wife?
[1703.04] You can say what you want 
to say to me, I will hear it.
[1706.04] But believe me,
[1708.68] aunt Musarrat is uncle’s 
second wife.
[1711.12] shhhh
[1712.92] Don’t talk nonsense to me.
[1719.40] Idrees cannot be anyone
 else’s other than me.
[1749.84] Where is Arooj?
[1751.00] Why is she not here till now?
[1755.60] She…
[1758.08] Why are you quiet?
 Answer me.
[1775.68] This means, she is not coming.
[1780.36] I will go and see!
[1844.84] Come with me.
[1845.64] Leave my hand.
[1847.00] Leave it, I said.
[1850.40] What do you think of yourself?
[1856.40] What is your worth in 
front of my mom and dad?
[1860.40] I am your wife; this is my worth.
[1862.48] Stop your nonsense.
[1864.96] This drama you had
 created it is all a flop.
[1869.84] Come nicely, with respect
[1871.32] and go and apologize 
to my mom and…
[1872.40] I will not apologize to anyone,
[1874.20] because I am right in my place.
[1878.64] Arooj,
[1882.48] don’t make me angrier.
[1884.76] Or else, what?
[1886.08] What will you do? Huh?
[1889.08] What will I do?
[1890.80] I will do what you
 haven’t even imagined.
[1895.12] One minute.
[1897.88] Today, I will show you.
[1901.40] Look at this file.
[1903.00] Read it. Read it.
[1905.56] What is this?
[1906.72] The home aunt
 Musarrat lives in,
[1908.76] is my papa’s property,
[1910.40] and uncle is stealing 
money from the office.
[1914.88] They are living on 
the office expense.
[1917.32] Say all this is a lie,
 it is all wrong.
[1919.16] Why don’t you say something?
[1920.88] Say it!
[1921.72] Arooj!
[1948.00] Elder madam,
[1949.60] get up quickly.
 Come with me.
[1952.32] What happened, Wasai?
[1953.72] Younger madam, 
and little master.
[1960.04] What happened between 
Salman and Arooj?
[1995.04] I am telling you,
[1998.44] now don’t say anything
 against my mom and dad.
[2004.04] Mom was absolutely right.
[2006.80] You are cunning.
[2013.44] Because of you,
[2014.68] this home and its
 relations fought.
[2017.04] Only because of you.
[2019.80] Look, there is still time.
[2023.56] I am asking you with a lot of love,
[2024.56] come on, go and apologize…
[2025.48] I told you; I will not 
apologize to anyone.
[2028.84] You won’t apologize?
[2029.72] No.
[2034.40] Arooj.
[2034.96] Salman.
[2038.68] Move back.
[2039.76] Don’t touch my daughter.
