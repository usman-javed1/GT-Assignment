Are you still upset with me? I am not upset. I am sad. Meaning, you are saying that I have given you sorrow. Are you asking me a question 
or accepting it? If it is a question, then, what will be your answer? Yes. You have given me sorrow. If the reports had not come in, then you would have gotten married. Arooj, don’t forget I had refused
 on every step. You stepped forward yourself and 
gave mom permission. What else could I do? You should have done the same, refused it. I thought that your refusal has no worth in front of 
aunt Mehreen. Arooj, I had the final decision of accepting 
or rejecting Alizeh in my hands. Anyway, I… I want to forget everything. But I will always remember one thing. I have been insulted badly 
because of aunt Mehreen. I got humiliated a lot because of her. I made a mistake. I realize this. If you want, you can forgive me or if you want, you can punish me. I accept. Speak up, what have you come to say? Do you even know that someone is hurt 
because of your stubbornness, someone’s heart has been hurt. I never hurt anyone’s heart. Now tell me, 
what do you want to say? For God’s sake, mom, I would still have to tell you 
what I came to talk about? If you find it reasonable, 
then tell me. Then listen, Arooj is really hurt because of 
what you did with her. Oh, so you came here to talk 
in favour of your wife. I didn’t come to talk in her favour. I am just telling you that 
whatever has happened, after this, at least you can go to Arooj 
and console her. You an do this, right? When I have not done anything, then 
why should go and apologize to Arooj? When did I ask you to apologize? You didn’t make it evident, 
but this is what you said. You want that your mother 
in this age goes and begs forgiveness from a girl 
who recently came. I never said anything like that. I am just saying that you can at least 
you can go and hug her with love. What I have not done anything, 
when I have no fault, then why should I go to her? All this Alizeh’s doing and 
she too is your friend. Right? So why should I go to that Arooj,
to apologize? Apologize. I will go mad. Alizeh. You must be really surprised 
seeing me in your room. You should be surprised too, because I try my best to not even
step in your room. Now how do I respond to that? You shouldn’t respond either. You sent Salman as your lawyer 
in front of me, right? No, I didn't. He stood in front of me and you are saying you didn’t do that. Hear me out clearly, Arooj, I will never apologize to you. I never wanted that 
you apologize to me. You want this, that is why Salman said this to me. But, I am surprised at what my fault is that I should apologize to you for? You don’t say sorry to me at all, you are like my mother. Mother? I cannot be your mother at all. I am just the mother of my Salman. This is not something about a day or two, I have been seeing Mehreen for years, she will never realize her mistakes. She will only do what she wants. What can we say? I become helpless in front of 
mom’s insistence. That’s why I am saying don’t tire yourself. Aunt, you have seen how much 
I have changed myself. I only become quiet for the sake of 
the environment of this home. I know, or else you were more stubborn
then Mehreen. So what is the point of this change? It made no difference. Arooj has been mistreated. Mistreated? And this mistreatment is only 
cause of mom’s insistence. So you do something that 
she forgets this incident. What do I do? I think you take Arooj and 
go abroad for a few days. Good idea. You are right. This way you two will get change as well 
and you will become fresh. Son, you only get life once, and in this once you have find 
happiness again and again. Sir, you called me? Yes, Mr. Irfan, this is mine 
and my wife’s passport, so you send this to the travel agent. Okay sir. Are you going somewhere with madam? It is a trip to Dubai. Great. Sir, will you tell me the dates? Everything is mentioned in it,
kindly send it. Okay, sir. Thank you. What is the matter? 
You are smiling a lot. It is something like that. When you hear it, 
you too will smile. Then tell me quickly, because it has been a long time 
that I laughed. So the thing is that we are going 
to Dubai for vacations. Really? Absolutely. So, finally… finally, I will get a chance 
to breath freely with you. We will get a chance to spend
time with you. You know, we do live together, but we never got free time. Yes. But Salman, I will tell you one thing, whether Dubai or any other country,
no business, please. Alright. Promise. No business. I will go and get fresh. Everything will be really beautiful. Freedom and carefree moments. Only Salman and I. The two of us will get a chance 
to meet each other. I am happy just thinking about it. I have a good news. Really? Then tell me quickly. I will tell you. I will tell you. Salman and I are going abroad 
for a trip. Oh my God. Congratulations.
Great. But isn’t this honeymoon a little late? So? What problem do you have? I have no issues, I am jealous. So, why are you jealous, stupid? 
Get married. Yes, but for that I should get 
a good boy, who likes me. Not just a good boy, even the mother of the child 
should be good. Yes, if I get a mother-in-law like you,
I will go mad. What do I say, man? 
Anyway, leave it. Tell me, what do I get for you? I will shop one day before coming. Salman, the tickets for you 
and Urooj are here. Check the meeting schedule once. Your flight has been booked 
for two days later. Thank you. Where are you two going? Mom, Arooj and I are going to Dubai. Hmmm. You two are going abroad and 
I don’t even know. Mom, I just told you that the two of us 
are going abroad. I am not talking about informing me, 
I am talking about permission. Even your manager would know this,
and I am your mother. Is there no worth of seeking my permission
 in your eyes? Mehreen, there is no reason to react 
so much in this. Salman, just told you that 
these two are going for an outing. No sister-in-law Shaista, 
there is a need. This action of Salman is going
against my upbringing. I have taught him all the rules of life. Today, I cannot tolerate his 
unruly behaviour today. Mom, what are you saying? What did I not do in your obedience? You create an issue out of everything, 
and nothing else. Really? You mean to say that 
I am responsible. I didn’t say that. You didn’t say that, but I will surely say that 
you were not like this earlier. All this has been done by this Arooj. Mom. Did you see? Did you see Mehreen? See how she made a mountain 
out of a mole hill. I am seeing her, Shaista. I am seeing it. For how long? How long will Mehreen do injustice 
to the children like this? Why is there no one 
who can question her? If someone will be in their senses, 
then they will ask questions. Mehreen’s mental condition doesn’t 
allow her to respond to any questions. This. This is the excuse everyone has. Earlier, she didn’t accept Arooj 
as her daughter-in-law, after that she made her not being 
able to bear a child, and doing this injustice. All this is intolerable, but… The plan of my children shouldn’t get 
cancelled because of these ifs and buts, Idrees. She is a weird woman, 
she cannot see anyone happy. Look Shaista, I have brought the tickets. 
I cannot do anything more than this. You can at least speak up. Salman will handle it himself, 
he himself is really stubborn. When is he stubborn? He is not stubborn anymore. My son has changed. I don’t know what happened to him. He has started to stay silent. Mom, is it necessary that we have a depressed 
environment in this home? You are telling me that I am responsible
for the depression? I didn’t say that at all. You know Salman, that I am your mother.
I love you dearly. Mom, I accept this. I know, no one in the world loves me 
more than you. Then would I not mind when my son 
doesn’t tell me anything about what he is doing. Okay fine, I accept my mistake. Now I am seeking your permission. Can I go? If you are asking for my permission now,
then what is the point? When I convinced you that
you need to seek permission. Then you tell me, 
what should I do? Do nothing and go to sleep. I am sleepy. Mom. Salman. What happened? Why do you people have 
such sad faces? Did Mehreen say something again? You know, it is impossible for us to go 
without mama’s permission. Yes, so son, you went to seek permission, then what did Mehreen say? Did she not agree? You guessed it right, aunt, she didn’t give us permission. There is a limit to stubbornness. That woman doesn’t care about 
anyone’s happiness. Uncle you do one thing, ask Nawaz and get our tickets cancelled. No, no, Idrees, you will not do that. This will be injustice with the children. Do anything and send these children. What can I do, Shaista? Aunt, try to understand. If we leave without mama’s permission, then all hell will break loose in this home. Nothing will happen. I will take care of Mehreen. Aunt, she will fight a lot with you. She won’t fight. She won’t. My children… I can tolerate everything for my children. Arooj, child, you prepare to leave. Pack. But Mehreen shouldn’t find out 
about this before you leave. Yes, if she finds out at the last moment, 
she will make a little noise and then she will get quiet. Okay? But Shaista…
What, but? That’s it. What I had to say, I said it. This is my decision. Hear me clearly. If you want to live in this home, you will 
have to live with my permission, and before anyone comes and 
goes from this home, you will seek permission from me. You understand, right? I won’t have to make you 
understand again, right? If you have to go anywhere, 
aunt Mehreen doesn’t like it. She creates hurdles. She has made this home a jail for me. Where all my desires are suffering 
the punishment. What do I do? I am so helpless and oppressed. Madam, should I bring your tea? What has happened to madam? I will find out. Madam, you look worried. Is everything fine? This woman wont let my children live. She is the enemy of their happiness. The heart of those two poor things 
got broken. What did Mehreen get ruining 
their happiness? And she doesn’t care at all. How can she do this? Madam, you don’t cry. God will make it all fine. I will make tea and bring it for you. Shaista you have promised the children 
that you will handle everything, but how? Because Idrees, when you have
to console someone’s heart, you shouldn’t be scared, and then I am doing all this 
for my son, Salman. But this conspiracy of yours 
will get caught, you will not have an answer. How will you handle Mehreen? If you think that taking care of my son’s happiness 
is a bad thing, or consoling the children 
is a conspiracy, then let me conspire. You know Mehreen’s anger and 
her mental condition. You also know that Mehreen has said 
no to Salman and Arooj. This way she will lose her mind. Yes, so when does she not 
lose her mind? I have heard this all my life that 
something will happen to Mehreen. I am tired. Till now, nothing happened to her. You are being overconfident Shaista. Because I have good intentions and I am sure nothing bad will happen. You don’t worry, that’s it. Fine, I will go now. What is all this, Arooj? I had said no, still you packed your bags? No aunty, this was packing from before. You said no later. and you didn’t like me saying no, right? What? No. I didn’t say that. But face clearly tells me that 
I have done injustice with you. Aunty, I didn’t complain to anyone. Okay, so you wanted to complain? Who would you have complained to? What happened Arooj? You don’t have an answer, right? No problem. But I can read it clearly on your face. I can tell everything. You don’t know how to read faces. Arooj. What are you thinking? I want to talk to you. Will you sit, please? Yes, tell me. Are we stealing something? No. Not at all. Why did you feel this way? Then why are we secretly 
making this plan? I mean, you can talk to aunt, 
you can convince her. Why can we not go taking her 
into confidence? We too have a life. Arooj, I agree to this, but mom won’t agree, and I want to take you for this trip 
at all cost. That’s why I quietly planned this trip. Fine. We will go secretly. Then? What will happen after that? Aunty will constantly call and I will get insulted 
when we come back. Arooj, not just you, both of us will get insulted. She won’t say anything to you, 
she is your mother. And you know she only loves you. I am not a shareholder in this love. And another thing 
that is most important, she is your mother, 
but my mother-in-law. Don’t worry. If mama does anything bad with you, I am with you. You will stand by me? You will go to the office, 
and later on, I, aunt Mehreen, 
this home and her taunts. Then you tell me,
what do I do? Will you agree to what I say? Obviously. 
Go ahead. Cancel this trip. I cancel this trip? What does this mean?
