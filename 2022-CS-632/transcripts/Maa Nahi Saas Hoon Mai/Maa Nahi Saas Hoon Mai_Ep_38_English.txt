Sir is a little short-tempered but he was never this strict. Why are you saying that? Because I feel very pity for Madam Jr, the poor girl is being
put through trouble. Madam, it’s just the husband because of whom a wife
spends her whole life with her in laws. It is not Salman’s fault, it’s Mehreen who has
taken control of his mind. The sad part is that
I cannot even do anything. who knows about your helplessness
better than I do, madam? And I even know that Madam Sr takes advantage
of her mental condition. That is why I am helpless else the day I tell the truth might be the last day
of Mehreen’s life, and this truth will be
the last shock of her life. I can understand your pain, madam, you are a mother ... ...who cannot even call her son to her son. Wasai, speak slowly, speak slowly, else, the years of being silent will turn into a storm and wash away everything. Forgive me. No, don’t ever bring this to
your mouth ever again. I will be careful next time but madam, if madam Sr’s own daughter
wasn't missing. Again? Wasai all these secrets
are connected, if one side reveals, every thread will fall loose. No, I am just saying if madam Sr had her own daughter she would have felt the
pain of daughters. Expecting something
nice from Mehreen is the biggest foolishness ever. You are right. Okay, if all your work is done, go check where Arooj is and send her to me. Okay madam. there is no misunderstanding, I have noticed everything myself. What things? Could you please explain? That is what I was asking Arooj, can you explain your relationship
with Ammad? But she didn’t give any answer. Arooj, my mobile. I won’t give it. Naseema? Hey, Naseema? Hey, what happened Master? That mischief took my phone
and ran away, catch her. Arooj? Arooj, where are you? Arooj, my child come in front of me else dad will get upset. Here I am. Arooj, my daughter. Catch this girl. Catch,
catch, catch, Arooj. Give dad’s phone back. Catch, catch, catch. You mischief. Come here. Catch this girl. Yet again you made the memories... ... of the past an ailment
of your heart today? Why don’t you understand
what I am saying? Okay, explain. Arooj is not happy there
because of Mehreen, Master. Only the fortunate are
happy with the in laws and no parents of any
daughter have... ... achieved anything by
being worried about this. So should we leave our
daughter to be that way? Arooj is educated and intelligent, she knows how to handle
these matters. So, is it necessary to handle, can’t something happen that might straighten
out this matter itself? And there is no need to
make anyone understand? Look, where there are people
who create complications, one needs to try to
straighten things. And the one who follows the
right path faces difficulties. Do you know what I think? Nature gifted Arooj to us
in the middle of the way. So why are you telling me this? I am telling you because we should be thankful for
the gifts that nature has given us, we should protect them and we are not able to
protect our Arooj, master. Be strong, the one who has been blessed
with this gift now, Salman will protect him. Do one thing, whenever you find an
appropriate time, do call her. You will be satisfied after
talking to Arooj. You will get scolded very
badly by me someday, what was the need to cry? Mehreen is a name of
such an evil spirit, whoever connects with her their bad days begin. I can’t even think like
that about them. Then don’t, but Mehreen will push you
to think like this one day. My mom hasn’t taught me to think
negatively or wrong of my elders. I have been an admirer of your mother’s
upbringing since the beginning, she has raised
her daughter so well. Aunt, such words from become my strength but Aunt, I don’t see any way through which I can make ... ...a little place for myself in
Aunt Mehreen’s heart. In Mehreen’s heart? Uff, who would want to live in
such a tough place? Okay forget about it, tell me something, how come your uncle got
against you all of a sudden? You don’t want to tell? There is nothing special to tell, Aunt. Okay then don’t tell I will find it out one day myself, what has happened that Idrees has become against
you all of a sudden but for your information,
the words that Salman and Mehreen are using
for you and Ammad, are not their but Idrees’ words. Yes. Come, come. Come. Come Master, you come here daily and feed the birds but… Do you remember that our Arooj used to come here
daily and feed the birds? And our courtyard used to
be crowded by those birds. Now that she has left, our courtyard has become empty. You are right, Master. The bird of our house has left, it just didn’t make our courtyard empty... ... but our entire house empty as well. Naseema, do you know, sometimes I feel that I am sitting here sad and she will suddenly come and cover
both my eyes with her hands and she will come in
front of me and say, what happened, dad? Are you sad because I am not here? look I have come now and then I will burst out laughing and then all of a sudden she will take my glasses
or mobile and run away and I will say, Arooj? Arooj? You are right, master, when I am cooking in the kitchen I feel that she will just
come from behind and will say you go rest
I will cook. My girl has gone to our house, she left her memories in our entire house. May God bless
my daughter with good fate. Amen. Ammad is saying with so much love, you should smile. No matter how dashing a boss is, it is never pleasant to meet them. but for your information, the words that Salman and Mehreen are
using for you and Ammad, are not their but Idrees’ words. get the new car if you want to, yes, yes, why not? Okay I will talk to you later. Boss, this AAZ Advertising
agency’s file. Both cheques are in here as well. Hmm, that’s great. Now let’s get this signed by Salman, and for every deal from now onwards I will give you 10% instead of 5% Boss, such generosity? Are you being sarcastic? No, boss, how can I dare? I am giving you more share so you can spend on your family. Thank you boss, but I guess you are
forgetting that ... ...the cheques of such huge amount .. ..cannot get cleared without
Madam Arooj’s sign. No, Arooj has no value now. Boss, she is the Finance Head. I am talking about,
in front of Salman. When I tell this to Salman, look what’s written on his face, anyway, I am going into Salman’s room, bring these files and cheques, we will get them signed. Okay Boss. You asked me to do this work
as soon as possible, right? Hmm. This file has all the details of Sasa
Group’s 30 lacs and Stone Berry’s 65 lacs. That’s okay, but the notes from 30 lacs
didn’t have any mark so we could recognize
where did they go but yes, the marble Mr Idrees has sold, it is very important to
find that person. By the way, I visited
this bungalow again Bravo to the gatekeeper, whenever you ask if there
is someone at home, he says Sir is not home. Mr Idrees has done such
a clean corruption. Okay then leave everything, we will take this file to Salman because I am afraid that Salman might not trust
anything that I say. Look, I am so sorry, this is your personal matter but why did you say all this? Uncle is playing such a dirty game. What can be dirtier than corruption? You won’t understand. Okay but it is not that easy to
understand Mr Idrees. Madam, you? Please have a seat. That’s not needed. What was being spoken
about Mr Idrees here? You are an employee here, you should be careful before saying ... ...anything regarding
the owners else… Okay I will be careful next time. It would be better if there
is no next time. I am sorry Ammad, I apologize on Aunt’s behalf. Please sit down. its ok I have figured it out by
what madam says that we are walking on
the right path. But what should
we do about this file now? We have to catch Mr Idrees
red-handed, what else? And how would that be possible? The accountant was telling that ... ...Mr Idrees got 2 cheques
made worth 5 million. I am sure he must be looking
to take this amount as well. And how can you be
so sure about it? Forbidden, if you get used to eating
the forbidden fruit once, you can’t really stop. Hmm. You are right but this will be Uncle’s last bite
of the forbidden fruit. Enough is enough now, you just keep on finding out. Okay. Salman, my child I cannot see
you worried like this, my heart aches when I see the sadness on the face
of a strong person like you. I am fine, uncle. Now you, to your father… I mean will you lie to me? I know you have always
loves me like a father and to be honest, I am just lying to myself so I can stay away from
the fear for a while. Look, son, I am a man so
I can understand your feelings. A man is possessive, I am sure you are in pain but end it now because I am afraid that it will
affect the business. What will happen to the
business, Uncle? Hey, Arooj and her incompetent team
have already ruined everything, we are facing loss
in the business, were there less problems
already that now we also have Ammad to
experiment on our business? Come in. Come, Mr Nawaz. Sir, there are few papers
of marketing and agency. Salman, my child, I have seen them,
you should see them once too. that’s not needed. If you have finalized just tell
me what I need to do. Son, our Housing project
needs marketing since there is a lot of competition, just sign these cheques, and
I will take care of the rest. Give it to me. Here. take it Nawaz, show this file to Arooj and her
Finance Officer once for approval. That’s not needed. When the owner of the
company said yes, nobody else’s approval matter. Hey, my son, I am talking about the system.
The system that you… I am the system. When I approved it, that is the final decision. And we are a part of you, you are our support. Okay. If you are not well, then go home early, I will… No, no, I am fine. Okay then I have some work to do. What do they say, where should I go after
changing the clothes, who should I make my hair for? Come on, at least smile. Smile, Arooj. Do you see the highlighted part? Now check its date. What were the prices
of it in the market and what price have
we purchased at. Wow, well done, Ammad. I know, see how loyal I am
with this company. And Mr Salman’s mother she always talks to me rudely. Not good. I will give an answer for that. Aunt you? What did you make? I made Haleem, myself. I thought I should bring
some for you. Thank you. How is your mom now, son? Yes she is absolutely fine. Ask ger from my side. Okay. I asked Wasai to get lemon
and the spices for it, she is such a slacker,
I will go check her. Wasai? What are you doing? Nothing boss, I was just… Are you calculating your share? Nawaz, money is like that, you enjoy it when you get it and you also enjoy it when
there is hope for you to get it. Wow, boss, such an amazing thing to say. Send them cheques
so we can get our share. Okay Boss. Okay? Yes, yes. I need to talk to you to the point. You? You will talk to me to the point? Yes, because I am habitual
of talking to the point. When my good is considered
my weakness, I have to raise my voice. Go away from here, Arooj, before I say something
very hurtful to you. So then say it, why don’t you? That is what I want to know, after all what is in your heart? Things that are talked
about behind closed door is called conspiracy but that’s not at all truth, tell me what is in your heart, say it to my face. Thank God, Sir is home. Greetings sir. Greetings, why are you standing here? Madam Sr has made
me wait for you. She asked me to send you to him
as soon as you come home. Quickly go, she is crying. I will see. Mom? Mom? Mom, what happened? Are you well? I don’t know, even if I am well I don’t know how long
will I be okay for. One of the sorrows
will kill me one day. What are you saying? Never say that again. What happened? I guess I just have this
to talk about now. What has happened? Tell me? Arooj, the biggest sorrow
of my life is Arooj. Is that even life? That is hanging
between yes and no. It is a crime to bear punishment
without committing a crime. And this is my life that I have got just for once, handing it over to an expedience
will be hypocrisy. Aunt, I have decided, I will talk to Salman today and I will talk to him to the point, I can’t bear the pain of these
incomplete issues daily. What will you say? that he has to change
the way he thinks, in fact, the thought that Aunt
Mehreen has been feeding his brain. I agree with you, Salman can never think like that. exactly, Salman can never think like this. Aunt, I know Salman very well, he is not the man who
can think like this, Words are being put into
Salman mouth. It is just Aunt Mehreen’s
personal grudges for me that she is taking out on
me through Salman. Mehreen has nothing
except hate. Anyway, I will talk to Salman with you. No Aunt, you leave this argument to me, because if you continuously
interfere in this matter, I think Salman will
start to ignore you. And if that happens once then who will speak for
me in this house? Wasai, where is Salman? Madam, Sir is in Madam Sr’s room. Okay go. ok Mehreen captured Salman as
soon as he came home, he won’t understand
what we will say now. But I have to talk.
