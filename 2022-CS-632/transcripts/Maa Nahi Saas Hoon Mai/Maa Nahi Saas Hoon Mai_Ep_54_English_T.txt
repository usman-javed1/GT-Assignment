[32.08] Arooj.
[38.20] You are crying secretly?
[40.68] But you are not telling
 me the reason for crying.
[44.24] No, I am not crying.
[61.16] I know how to differentiate between 
crying faces and laughing faces.
[68.56] Maybe you wanted to 
say something else,
[72.08] say that.
[74.64] Hmm
[76.52] I don’t want to say anything,
[79.04] because there is no point 
in saying anything.
[88.32] For you, I am a mother in law for you,
[92.60] when do you consider 
me your mother.
[115.68] and the one who I considered 
my mother for so long,
[120.56] when is she my mother.
[124.52] Maybe I have no mother.
[133.20] What are you thinking?
[138.76] Nothing.
[142.64] Arooj,
[145.68] child, I know you well.
[153.40] You are good girl who lives happily.
[167.56] But I have been noticing 
for the past few days,
[172.08] you have become really dull.
[184.16] I can feel your pain.
[197.12] Take care of yourself,
[200.28] and listen,
[202.96] stay happy.
[277.16] Yes.
[285.44] Aunt, I need your help.
[288.52] Yes, go ahead.
[289.76] What help do you want?
[291.88] I want to plan a surprise for Arooj?
[295.32] Really?
[296.40] Then I will surely help you.
[298.24] Tell me, what do I have to do?
[299.52] So, the idea is…
[362.60] I don’t want to say anything,
[365.20] because there is no 
point in saying anything.
[369.24] For you I am a mother
 in law for you,
[373.52] when do you consider 
me your mother.
[382.32] You are good girl 
who lives happily.
[389.48] But I have been noticing for 
the past few days,
[394.04] you have become really dull.
[397.76] I can feel your pain.
[401.88] Take care of yourself,
[404.96] and listen,
[407.64] stay happy.
[424.00] This sudden love of aunt Mehreen 
is not without a reason.
[442.52] She wants to know,
[448.76] the reason for this condition of mine.
[454.64] This means
[459.08] I am unable to stop the storm 
inside me from coming outside
[470.32] and if this barrier breaks,
[477.32] aunt Mehreen and Salman will find out
[484.12] and everything will end on that day.
[489.72] Mama is right,
[492.72] this thing shouldn’t get revealed.
[556.88] Salman,
[558.56] where are you taking me?
[561.36] To such a place where your
 memory will come back.
[565.12] What has happened to you?
[566.24] What happened to my memory?
[567.96] Wait.
[569.40] Just wait and watch.
[573.52] Tadaa!
[574.60] Surprise.
[575.60] Surprise.
[579.04] Come here,
[581.04] hold this.
[582.72] Hold it.
[591.00] Just a second. Wait.
[594.76] Where did it go?
[601.56] Happy birthday to you.
[605.72] Happy birthday to you.
[609.76] Happy birthday dear Arooj.
[614.48] Happy birthday to you.
[619.16] Happy birthday to you.
[627.44] Many, many happy returns
 of the day, child.
[629.24] Happy birthday.
[631.76] Now feed me some cake.
[695.48] Arooj.
[707.64] What happened to Arooj, son?
[710.68] I don’t know.
[770.64] No matter what,
[777.56] this cannot be my birthday.
[785.20] Who knows the day of my birth?
[796.16] Who know where I was born?
[807.00] Who knows which day I was born?
[815.20] No.
[818.72] This is not my birthday.
[823.72] In fact, this is the day,
[827.28] when I was found.
[849.16] Go ahead, child, Arooj.
[854.00] I didn’t come to say anything today.
[860.88] I came to listen.
[872.48] Tell me the entire story from the start.
[874.32] I want to know the entire story.
[882.84] Child, you ask questions,
[885.60] we will answer it.
[889.32] Where did you people find me?
[895.76] Child, your mother and I
[898.32] had gone to meet a friend
 of mine on the highway.
[906.60] On our way back,
[907.36] we heard a child crying in the shrubs.
[919.28] We looked around,
[920.92] no one was there.
[931.28] Your father moved towards 
the shrubs.
[935.44] He found you there.
[948.64] He immediately picked you up
[950.64] and brought you to me.
[957.84] There were you crying badly.
[960.52] My heart exploded seeing you.
[971.80] I hugged you uncontrollably.
[977.48] After that?
[978.92] What happened then?
[981.16] Child, I lifted you in my arms
[982.68] and took you around in
 the entire area nearby,
[985.60] but no one recognized you.
[994.48] So you didn’t file a report
 with the police?
[997.56] I even went to the police station,
[1000.12] but there was no report 
of a missing child there.
[1016.72] Meaning,
[1020.04] I had gotten lost and -
[1023.44] no one filed a report for me.
[1027.52] We felt that nature has given
 us a gift in your form.
[1051.20] Will you tell me,
[1052.72] exactly what point on the super
 highway did you find me?
[1167.76] This is what the location says
[1174.36] Yes,
[1175.60] I too feel this is the police station.
[1178.36] Yes.
[1179.32] Shall we go and find out?
[1180.24] Yes, come on.
[1181.28] come on.
[1190.88] I think this is it.
[1192.20] Yes, shall we go?
[1221.00] You surprise me.
[1222.96] Now you have realized
[1224.20] that you need to search
 for the child?
[1227.00] But you must have something
 in your record.
[1229.32] This incident took place 
near your police station.
[1233.40] Yes, we will surely find something.
[1235.68] Some application. Some report.
[1237.64] Madam, forgive me.
[1240.12] Earlier we used to write
 reports with our hands,
[1242.16] these computers just came in.
[1244.84] But now
[1246.12] you have to help us.
[1248.00] Please find a way.
[1251.24] Madam, I don’t understand
[1254.04] what I can do in this? .
[1261.32] Madam
[1269.76] Greetings.
[1270.88] Greetings.
[1272.76] Yes, Imran,
[1273.80] what is their matter?
[1276.28] Sir,
[1277.52] some girl had gotten lost,
[1279.08] they are inquiring about her.
[1280.96] Sir, there was so much
 rain at that time,
[1284.80] there was a flood,
[1286.16] the entire police station 
was washed away, sir.
[1288.40] We have no record.
[1290.28] Yes, the SHO is right.
[1292.56] But sir, you can help 
us with something.
[1296.08] Look,
[1297.12] this is such an old matter,
[1299.44] it cannot be solved.
[1302.04] God knows how many SHOs 
came during this time.
[1304.60] Then there was a flood,
[1305.92] there was rain,
[1306.80] there was a lot of destruction.
[1307.68] The entire record of the
 police station got wasted.
[1310.24] It is really difficult.
[1312.40] It is a matter of someone’s life.
[1320.08] Hmmm.
[1322.20] Fine, do one thing,
[1323.84] you give an application.
[1325.44] I will order a reinvestigation.
[1328.12] Okay?
[1328.88] Okay fine, thank you.
[1331.16] Imran,
[1332.12] take the application from them,
[1333.64] and yes, do take the home address
 and contact number.
[1337.16] Fine, you go with her,
[1338.84] and get your application recorded.
[1341.16] Thank you.
[1342.08] Welcome.
[1344.04] Akbar take the history of the
 case from them in detail.
[1350.68] Imran,
[1352.12] ask for all the record,
[1353.64] bring all the registers.
[1355.12] I want to check it,
[1356.48] maybe we will find 
something from it.
[1359.40] Okay, sir.
[1362.44] Bring all the record 
of the police station,
[1364.24] sir wants to check.
[1367.80] Sir, tea or water?
[1370.40] No, thank you.
[1372.52] Shanzay
[1373.72] I feel we will find the police 
record with difficulty.
[1378.48] Arooj, it is difficult but 
not impossible.
[1382.48] You always give me courage
 by saying this.
[1385.36] Okay, lets do one thing,
[1386.72] let’s go to the SP office,
[1387.80] we will surely get some 
help from there.
[1391.08] Yes, good idea. Come on.
[1405.48] You know, Shanzay,
[1408.16] my heart says
[1410.28] my parents are present 
somewhere over here.
[1416.32] You will see,
[1418.04] one day they will find me
[1420.88] and I will be found.
[1425.24] But
[1426.36] will they too be looking for me,
[1428.60] the way I am looking for them.
[1431.08] Yes, Arooj, obviously, 
that’s how it will be.
[1435.36] Then
[1437.40] why did they not find me for so long,
[1440.16] or did they too got disappointed
 trying hard.
[1448.72] But you will see,
[1450.16] I will find my parents,
[1452.20] I will not lose hope.
[1455.08] The courage with which you
 are finding your parents,
[1457.96] you will see, one day 
you will find them.
[1463.84] You know,
[1465.40] my papa always says,
[1469.80] only that person wins
[1471.56] who has the passion to win
[1475.16] and I will surely win,
[1480.32] because my passion is true.
[1482.80] That’s like my brave girl.
[1485.28] Shall we go?
[1519.32] You?
[1521.76] When did you come?
[1523.68] It has been a long time.
[1531.68] Where are you coming from?
[1536.64] I…
[1543.32] I went to do some work.
[1545.80] To the police station?
[1559.76] To file a report for a missing child?
[1568.64] What do you have to do with
 a twenty five year old case?
[1582.08] I am asking you something, 
who is that girl?
[1590.32] Child,
[1591.40] I wanted to give you an advice.
[1595.16] Don’t let your in-laws find 
out about all this.
[1600.60] What if you have to face
 more difficulties.
[1608.48] I didn’t ask you a difficult question,
[1614.80] that you are thinking so hard.
[1623.36] Arooj, I am asking you something.
[1624.96] Answer me, who is that 
girl who is missing…
[1627.00] My friend.
[1638.24] She is my friend.
[1643.24] A girl in her family got lost.
[1655.72] So I thought
[1658.60] I should also help in trying to find her.
[1674.04] That’s what I am trying.
[1683.40] There is something
[1685.24] that is being hid from me.
[1708.68] Oh wow,
[1710.68] today my son got time to say 
good night to his mama.
[1717.32] I remember well,
[1719.48] when you used to wake up in 
your sleep in childhood,
[1722.12] you would say goodnight again.
[1726.56] Oh wow,
[1728.24] you remember everything about me.
[1731.40] If I don’t remember things about you,
[1733.88] then I will die, Salman.
[1737.08] Mom,
[1738.80] you have started saying the
 same things again.
[1741.68] I know. I know you become 
restless hearing these things.
[1745.12] But I used to assure you that
[1748.04] I will not go anywhere 
leaving my Salman.
[1756.08] Mom,
[1758.24] I came to ask you something.
[1761.92] Yes, ask.
[1766.40] Did you say something to Arooj?
[1775.24] She is really dull.
[1779.88] Did you see?
[1787.88] You cleared my misunderstanding again.
[1790.88] I thought my son came...
[1792.48] ... to say goodnight to his mother,
[1794.04] but no,
[1797.32] you are worried for someone else.
[1808.52] Go,
[1809.88] I don’t want to talk to you.
[1813.76] No mom, there is nothing like that.
[1818.72] I came to talk to you.
[1822.76] I was just saying that…
[1824.04] Look Salman,
[1825.60] I am just telling you for your comfort that
[1829.36] I have not said anything to Arooj till now.
[1832.12] Only because of you.
[1834.20] Or else, since that girl has come to this home,
[1836.24] she is creating difficulties for me in everything.
[1842.44] What difficulties?
[1844.60] This.
[1845.68] Is this not enough
[1847.32] that you are still talking about her right now.
[1850.00] My son doesn’t have time to talk to his mother.
[1857.00] Okay fine, I am sorry.
[1863.84] I have made a mistake,
[1866.08] I admit this.
[1880.28] Take care of yourself.
[1883.48] Goodnight.
[1884.36] Goodnight.
[1917.32] I am not going to get impressed 
by these tears of yours.
[1922.48] I am not shedding these tears for you,
[1926.16] I am shedding them for me.
[1929.64] Another dialogue.
[1931.56] I am well aware of the innocence...
[1934.56] ... hiding behind this face of yours, Arooj.
[1939.60] Then also teach me all this.
[1944.32] How do you read someone’s face?
[1978.00] Child, me and your mother
[1980.48] had gone to meet a friend of 
mine on the highway.
[1987.20] On our way back, we heard 
a child crying in the shrubs.
[1991.52] We looked around,
[1992.96] no one was there.
[1996.08] Your father moved towards 
the shrubs.
[2000.20] He found you there.
[2006.48] He immediately picked you up
[2008.60] and brought you to me.
[2015.88] There were you crying badly.
[2018.56] My heart exploded seeing you.
[2035.48] Child, I lifted you in my arms
[2037.04] and took you around in 
the entire area nearby,
[2039.96] but no one recognized you.
[2043.04] So you didn’t file a report 
with the police?
[2046.20] I even went to the police station,
[2048.80] but there was no report 
of a missing child there.
[2054.00] We felt that nature has given 
us a gift in your form.
[2067.04] Twenty five years?
[2071.04] I was brought up in people who were ...
[2081.76] ...never my own for twenty five years.
[2090.32] I have been left alone.
[2105.16] No,
[2107.96] how can I think all this?
[2115.64] If they were not my own, then,
[2123.68] I too wasn’t their child.
[2132.92] But they never let me feel this.
[2142.48] Whatever
[2146.96] it is I have to find my 
mother and father.
[2155.08] I have to ask them once,
[2160.28] that why did they separate 
me from themselves?
[2165.56] If I had gotten lost, then
[2167.28] why did they not search for me?
[2173.20] What sort of a mother was she 
that didn’t even search for me.
[2200.08] Aunty, you?
[2204.28] It is a problem to look for you.
[2210.40] Why were you looking for me?
[2213.32] You are right.
[2215.12] Why was I doing this useless thing?
