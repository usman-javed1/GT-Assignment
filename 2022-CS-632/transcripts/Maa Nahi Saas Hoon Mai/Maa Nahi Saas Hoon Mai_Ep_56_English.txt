Arooj, my mobile. 
I won’t give it. Naseema? 
Hey, Naseema? Hey, what happened Master? That mischief took my phone 
and ran away, catch her. Arooj? Arooj, where are you? Arooj, my child come in front of me 
else dad will get upset. Here I am. Arooj, my daughter. Catch this girl. Catch, 
catch, catch, Arooj. Give dad’s phone back. Catch, catch, catch. You mischief. Come here. 
Catch this girl. What is this? This is a clock that is 
put on the wall. Very good and what is this? 
Kite. Kite. How does the kite fly? We make it fly then some other kite
cuts it then it comes back flying to us. Good girl. And what is this? Turtles, they live in water, and if they don’t like something 
they put their face in their shell. Yeah, and what is this? This is a bird that flies in the sky. Very good. 
You are very intelligent. Mom, I am very hungry, 
when will the food get done? yes, Mom’s love, food will be ready in just 5 minutes and Mom has made Arooj’s 
favorite food today, guess what? Noodles Ma.. Arooj, my child, 
when did you come? And what are you doing in the kitchen
it’s so hot in here, go, go sit in the room, 
I will be there. How did you even think about it? Arooj, it’s not like you have no one 
at your back. How can I believe you, mom? You found me on the middle 
of the road all alone like someone threw me off 
as a burden. These are all your things. We found you wrapped 
in these clothes and this, and you had this bracelet 
in your hand as well. Areej? My name was Areej. Arooj, I am asking you something, 
who is that girl, who is missing… My friend. She is my friend. One girl went missing from her 
acquaintances, so I just thought of trying to help her
in finding her, I am just trying that. Someone had kept you 
with a lot of love, this gold bracelet, these clothes, God knows what must have happened to you that you got separated 
from your parents. But Arooj, I have raised you exactly 
like my own child, I guess, if I had had a child 
of my own, I would have never loved her as much as I love you, 
I am telling you the truth, you, you tell me, tell me have you ever felt that you are not our child or we are not your parents. But that is the truth, Mom. Neither I am your child, nor you are my mother. I want to know, Mom, after all who are my actual parents? What happened to me? 
Where did they go? Why did they leave me? After looking at all these things I feel, 
I, I was very dear to my parents, 
they used to love me a lot. Then what happened 
in my life that I am here and God knows 
where did they go, so far away from me? Why did this happen to me? Sir Jr, shall I get water for you? No, let it be, where is Arooj? She is not at home. Okay, you may go. Okay. Amazing, she is your wife and 
you are asking people? You should know
 where your wife is. I called her, her number is switched off. Where can she go without telling you,
 Salman? This is beyond my understanding. Mom, I don’t get it myself that 
what has happened to her, I don’t know why is she so worried for 
so many days, I don’t know what is the matter. Salman, if you don’t know 
then who knows? I will ask her. For now, I am very worried myself. Look Salman, your worry, you either get rid of it 
very soon or fix it. Since the day this Arooj 
entered my son’s life, She has destroyed the peace 
of my son’s life. I don’t understand what should I do
about this girl. Her fever hasn’t yet come down, doctor was saying it will 
come down in an hour. Here, I have brought the medicines, did you give her the medicine 
that the doctor gave? Yes, I did but the fever still hasn’t come down. It will come down, if God wills. My girl wouldn’t have been so exhausted
if the doctor had given a medicine that would help the temperature 
come down quickly. Arooj? Yes? Yes, Mom’s life? Arooj? Now see, our Arooj’s fever 
will get away in a snap, it will get absolutely fine, right? Arooj, my child, your Dad is calling you, come. she is your wife and 
you are asking people? You should know 
where your wife is. Where can she go without
telling you, Salman? This is beyond my understanding. Mom, I don’t get it myself that 
what has happened to her, I don’t know why is she so worried
 for so many days, I don’t know what is the matter. Salman, if you don’t know then who knows? For now, I am very worried myself. Look Salman, your worry, you either get rid of it very soon
or fix it. Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier? My child, now that you have found it, look at your condition, had we told you earlier your personality 
would have shattered completely. My child, control yourself, you are the only reason that I 
and Naseema are alive. The love for both of you will never 
decrease from my heart but I want to find my parents, will you help me? Definitely, my child. We even tried before but my child, don’t ruin your future while 
you are finding your past. Arooj? Arooj, my child, I don’t know how to talk intellectually
like your dad, but we hid this all from you
till date because I didn’t want you 
to get away from me. My child, now that 
you have found it, look at your condition, had we told you earlier your personality
would have shattered completely. My child, control yourself, you are the only reason that 
I and Naseema are alive. My child, don’t ruin your future while 
you are finding your past. Hello? Arooj, where are you? At mom’s house. Mom’s house? So at least you should have informed
when you were leaving. I would have told you if I had known anything myself. What do you mean? Nothing, you were calling, tell me? Arooj, what happened to you? You have been behaving so strangely
for past so many days, what has happened? Nothing has happened to me,
Salman, don’t worry. I shouldn’t worry? How should I not worry 
when you are here, Arooj? You always embarrass me
in front of Mom. If you think that then okay, I am sorry, but I never wanted that. Arooj, what has happened? You can at least tell me, 
you can share it with me. Salman, look I was missing 
Mom and Dad a lot, so I have come here, and I want to live here for a few days,
and please don’t disturb me. Bye. yes, but Arooj… Arooj? What is wrong with her?
