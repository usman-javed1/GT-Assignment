[31.68] Salman?
[35.76] What happened?
[38.80] What Is It? 
Why Is your mood off?
[42.44] What Is It, son? 
Tell me?
[44.44] What should I tell you?
[46.52] What do I even have to tell you?
[49.20] I fix one thing the other one 
gets ruined;
[52.32] someone gets upset and then 
the other one gets upset.
[58.68] I can understand, son,
[61.00] your life Is difficult,
[64.12] but what has happened now? 
At this exact moment?
[66.80] Whatever happens every day
[68.84] and the sad part Is, nothing 
even gets better.
[74.92] Mom says something and 
Arooj says something else,
[77.52] and when I make them confront 
each other, there Is a battle,
[81.48] I don’t understand who should 
I listen to and who I shouldn’t.
[85.16] Who do you want to listen to?
[86.88] I don’t want to listen to anyone,
[88.80] I just want to listen to what’s right
[91.04] and what I can understand.
[96.28] And who do you think Is right 
out of both of them?
[99.60] I don’t know.
[101.92] Mom says that Arooj has 
misbehaved with me
[104.08] and when I ask Arooj, 
she says I don’t know anything,
[106.36] you tell me what should I do?
[109.28] If Arooj has said so,
[112.20] then she is right.
[115.92] And mom?
[117.76] She Is lying?
[119.20] No, she Is not lying,
[123.64] Mehreen’s problem is that
[125.64] she doesn’t remember what has 
she said to someone and when.
[130.24] So that Is confusing me,
[131.96] I have been stuck between them,
 what should I do?
[135.00] Whatever is going on,
[136.72] don’t take all these things 
on your nerves.
[140.92] Okay?
[142.36] You are going to the office, 
right? Go.
[145.76] Bye.
[146.88] Bye.
[171.28] What Is this problem?
[179.04] Mehreen’s madness has put 
everyone’s life in trouble.
[236.80] Why don’t you say that you have 
some problem with mom
[240.28] and you just didn’t come 
to the breakfast table
[242.40] so you don’t get to meet Mom
[244.00] and I don’t get to find out the reality?
[252.16] What reality?
[256.68] You have misbehaved with mom, 
right?
[259.36] I? 
Don’t lie to me,
[262.68] she has spent the entire night 
in the lounge, she was very tensed.
[266.60] What have I even said to her?
[269.76] What did she even say to you?
[272.20] She just asked you how was 
your dinner with Salman.
[274.88] How did your time go?
[276.48] She didn’t ask me anything like that,
You are lying.
[290.12] My happiness,
[296.92] my happiness is so temporary,
[308.52] very non-durable,
[316.60] I guess happiness and peace
[326.00] have slipped out of my palms 
and fallen somewhere.
[338.28] And Salman,
[341.68] Salman’s tongue has started 
to blow fire.
[373.68] Salman is worried there
[375.92] and I see you crying here,
[379.04] what is this joke?
[382.24] my life has become a joke, aunt,
[392.60] I just get one moment of happiness 
and then I spend so many days in grief.
[398.24] What is all this?
[405.52] my child,
[407.52] I have always supported you, right?
[414.20] I know what you are saying is true
[417.68] and correct.
[419.72] But Salman Is not ready to accept 
anything that I say as true or correct.
[426.20] According to you,
[428.44] Salman just listens to Mehreen, yeah?
[432.88] So, my child, why are you making 
yourself worried by thinking this?
[439.12] Because I cannot get away 
this thought from myself.
[442.00] Why?
[448.32] Aunt Mehreen has been 
pushing me in a marsh,
[454.52] even after trying to put in 
a lot of effort,
[457.92] I have been getting stuck deeper 
in that marsh,
[461.08] what should I do?
[464.68] Look my child,
[466.60] will you listen to me If I give you 
a suggestion?
[472.96] You stop trying to put
in these efforts
[476.72] and just get silent.
[481.60] How can I just get silent, Aunt?
[485.72] Aunt Mehreen even provokes 
the walls to speak up.
[490.08] Mehreen does wrong with everyone.
[494.20] I consider Mehreen a mental patient, 
my child,
[502.80] you will be at peace 
if you accept that too.
[508.84] Even Salman got upset 
with me and left,
[512.04] his entire day will be ruined.
[514.00] Don’t worry,
[516.92] I have listened to everything
that Salman had to say,
[519.16] and I have comforted him 
and sent him.
[527.44] Do you know, Aunt,
[532.32] you take care of Salman like a mother,
[536.04] care about him.
[560.76] Okay get up and wash your face,
 good girl,
[564.24] go and get freshen up. 
Get up, good girl. Go.
[597.56] Because, my love,
[606.52] Salman is not Mehreen’s son
[612.84] but mine, mine.
[620.36] And look at my ill fate,
[629.36] I cannot tell this to anyone 
even if I want to.
[639.64] I cannot tell this to anyone.
[647.20] I feel like screaming and telling It 
to everyone that Salman Is my son,
[653.56] my son,
[657.40] Not Mehreen’s,
[663.96] but…
[730.20] She is a very strange woman,
[733.84] she has complicated the entire home
[737.52] and made Arooj fed up as well
[740.76] By the way, our daughter is not 
the one who gets fed up,
[744.84] such hot and cold things happen
 in every house,
[748.68] you must not worry.
[751.52] I am thinking of calling her at 
my place for a few days,
[757.56] she will be relaxed.
[760.24] You have decided yourself that
 Arooj is in tension
[767.64] and she will come and stay 
with you for a few days,
[771.36] she is someone’s daughter-In-law now
[773.76] and after that she is your daughter.
[784.56] Mr. Master doesn’t even listen to me;
[797.60] it is not possible
[805.12] for a daughter-In-law to stay happy 
with a mother-In-law like Mehreen.
[819.48] Wives’ fate is like lotto,
[829.24] it’s good if your name comes up
[834.84] else all your savings go to waste.
[867.12] How do mothers get to know that
[870.36] their daughters are worried?
[880.60] Greetings, mom.
[882.60] Greetings.
[885.36] How are you, Arooj, my child?
[887.96] I am fine mom, 
are you and dad well?
[891.72] Yes, we are absolutely fine,
[894.12] we are just worried for you.
[900.40] What will happen to me, mom, 
I am very happy.
[905.68] I didn’t ask you
[912.00] if my daughter Arooj is happy or not.
[919.56] What does that mean, mom?
[923.60] It simply means that I know.
[930.48] You know what?
[932.44] What you know as well
[937.20] and are hiding it from your mother.
[948.16] I know, my child,
[951.72] you are not happy at all.
[958.56] Mom,
[961.68] Salman is my courage.
[1004.04] Trust me,
[1005.72] Arooj has misbehaved so much 
with your mother.
[1013.84] But what was the reason to 
behave like that?
[1019.48] Arooj doesn’t need any reason 
to fight with me, Salman.
[1030.20] I just asked her how was your dinner,
[1038.72] her tone showed that I didn’t have
 any right to ask her.
[1045.00] You know that I have never even 
spoken to Wasai in this tone, and I,
[1050.12] why does she?
[1051.76] Why does she forget that 
I am your mother?
[1057.16] Okay don’t worry, I will talk to her.
[1060.36] No, don’t talk to her at all,
[1063.68] you will go to the office
[1065.12] and then she will say wrong things 
to me later again.
[1067.00] Don’t talk to her at all.
[1081.12] What did she even say to you?
[1087.52] She just asked you how was 
your dinner with Salman.
[1090.52] How did your time go?
[1091.84] She didn’t ask me anything like that,
[1093.48] You are lying.
[1097.20] You call me a liar she calls me 
a magician;
[1101.20] she says that I have trapped you 
in love with me
[1104.48] and you are getting distant 
from her.
[1114.24] What is this tone 
you are talking to me in?
[1117.40] Have you seen your tone 
and your voice?
[1126.76] It is very strange
[1129.56] that one should even get hurt and
there shouldn’t be any noise?
[1133.72] And what about how you have 
hurt mom’s sentiments?
[1135.76] I am not responsible for it.
[1137.52] Then who is responsible? Yeah?
[1139.00] She herself is responsible because 
she assumes everything on her own,
[1142.88] like you, you made me stand 
in the court,
[1146.20] you question and I answer
[1148.12] because I am your culprit
[1152.96] and that is
[1156.56] because I love you.
[1171.00] Who do you want to listen to? 
I don’t want to listen to anyone,
[1174.96] I just want to listen to what’s right
[1177.00] and what I can understand.
[1182.40] And who do you think is right 
out of both of them?
[1185.84] I don’t know.
[1188.04] Mom says that Arooj has 
misbehaved with me
[1190.20] and when I ask Arooj, 
she says I don’t know anything,
[1192.20] you tell me what should I do?
[1195.28] If Arooj has said so,
[1198.20] then she is right.
[1276.88] I have heard enough praises 
of Salman from you,
[1288.76] but you live with your mother-in-law 
Mehreen all day,
[1298.68] tell me
[1301.04] how she treats you?
[1311.04] Don’t hide, my child, Arooj,
[1313.44] please at least tell your mother.
[1318.96] What do you think
how her behavior must be?
[1326.28] Like it is between a mother 
and a daughter.
[1332.24] What fantasies are you talking
 about, mom?
[1337.60] A mother-In-law can 
never be a mother.
[1339.84] No, my child,
[1341.36] she can definitely be.
[1344.44] How can you be so sure?
[1352.28] You are not a mother-in-law; 
you are a mother.
[1356.72] Yes, I am just a mother,
[1361.20] okay
[1363.08] just leave it, tell me
[1366.56] how Is Sister Shaista’s behaviour 
with you?
[1370.64] Arooj, my child, she loves you right?
[1376.72] Yes, yes, she Is very nice,
[1379.00] she takes so much care of me
[1381.48] but she said a very strange thing 
to me today.
[1386.28] About what?
[1389.36] About you?
[1391.64] About Aunt Mehreen.
[1404.48] What Is It?
[1406.16] According to her I should ignore 
what Aunt Mehreen says,
[1411.08] she is a mental patient.
[1422.00] No, no my child, 
you must not say that.
[1426.68] But mom, how can you live with 
a mental patient? She…
[1444.76] Aunt actually…
[1446.28] So, I am a mental patient?
[1452.76] I am mad,
[1455.12] I get seizures…
[1458.28] No aunt, actually…
[1460.60] Shut the hell up!
[1475.76] Whom were you telling 
I am a mental patient?
[1479.00] Umm I was talking to mom.
[1482.04] Like mother like daughter.
[1484.72] Such mothers give birth 
to daughters like you.
[1491.72] Aunt please
[1493.52] don’t say anything about my mom.
[1495.44] Really?
[1496.92] I am someone’s mother too,
[1498.88] you can say whatever you want 
about me, you can even call me mad?
[1504.24] No, no, It’s not that aunt, 
actually…
[1506.24] Now whatever it is,
[1508.72] this will be decided.
[1511.12] I am sorry. Aunt, please I…
[1546.16] Hello?
[1548.56] Mom?
[1555.88] Now there Is nothing to hide 
from you, Mom,
[1558.36] you know everything now.
[1564.84] She is like that.
[1566.72] I was even telling you.
[1569.56] Hello?
[1597.96] Mom?
[1599.92] Why aren’t you talking?
[1616.44] Mom?
[1619.52] The phone is still connected. 
Mom?
[1652.84] Naseema? Nasee…
[1656.08] Naseema? Naseema?
[1658.60] Naseema?
[1660.12] Hey, Naseema?
[1662.44] Naseema? Naseema?
[1666.60] Let me get water.
[1674.40] Aunt, Aunt…
[1676.52] What happened, my child?
is everything okay?
[1678.76] Aunt, mom.
[1679.88] Relax what has happened?
[1681.80] I was talking to mom in call,
[1683.84] all of a sudden mom’s voice
 stopped coming
[1686.24] though the call was still connected 
but there was no response.
[1689.20] So, what Is there to worry about?
[1691.12] It must be a network Issue.
[1692.44] There is no issue, I am very scared, 
I am very tensed, Aunt.
[1696.76] Okay, okay don’t worry, 
call your dad and ask.
[1701.32] Dad?
[1702.96] No, I am scared,
[1704.88] you know there must be something
else this has never happened.
[1708.04] Hey there must be nothing 
that is why I am asking you
[1710.80] to call your dad and 
ask so you are satisfied.
[1714.24] Aunt I am scared;
[1716.56] I won’t be able to talk.
[1718.48] Okay, do one thing,
[1720.36] dial your dad’s number and 
I will talk to him.
[1724.16] Give.
[1728.04] Relax.
[1731.12] Fool.
[1744.96] The call is ringing but Mr. Master 
Is not attending the call.
[1747.84] I told you something has happened
[1750.76] else it never happens that 
no one picks up the call.
[1753.32] There must be nothing, 
everything will be fine, If God wills
[1756.76] and wait and watch your dad will 
call you himself.
[1760.44] Don’t worry. Go.
[1773.24] This girl has a heart like a bird.
[1776.20] Careful Naseema, have courage.
[1780.96] That’s it, nothing, it’s done, 
it’s done, we are here,
[1785.76] come, sit,
[1788.00] come sit here.
[1792.24] Sit.
[1800.28] I told your condition to the doctor
[1803.72] he asked me to bring you 
to the hospital,
[1806.80] let the neighbor’s boy bring 
the rickshaw,
[1810.96] you just need to make an effort.
[1814.48] Master, the rickshaw is here.
[1816.64] Okay, okay,
[1818.28] come, come Naseema, 
get up, get up.
[1821.76] Get up.
[1826.12] Careful, careful,
[1828.96] that’s it, that’s it,
[1830.60] just put in efforts to get 
to the rickshaw.
[1833.68] Hey nothing will happen. 
Careful.
[1856.72] Hello?
[1858.64] Hello, dad?
[1860.36] You were not attending my call,
[1861.84] mom’s phone was not even 
going through, is mom well?
[1864.48] Yes, daughter, your mom is 
absolutely fine now.
[1868.52] What do you mean by now?
What happened to mom?
[1871.76] I don’t know I guess 
she was talking to you,
[1874.44] all of a sudden, 
she got dizzy and fell,
[1880.68] thank God I came in time 
and brought her to the hospital.
[1885.16] Hospital?
[1887.32] Make me talk to mom.
[1889.76] She is in the room right now;
[1891.40] I am going to pay the bill 
we will go home then.
[1896.24] Don’t worry, your mom 
Is absolutely fine.
[1899.76] How can I not worry?
[1902.72] I am coming to meet mom; 
I won’t be satisfied unless I see her.
[1906.92] Okay fine, we are going home
[1909.04] and you can come home then 
and don’t worry at all.
[1913.56] Okay fine I am coming.
[1915.04] Bye.
[1916.44] Bye.
[1921.52] What does dad know
[1927.16] what happened on call.
[1941.08] I was tolerating the shocks given 
by Aunt Mehreen until now,
[1954.00] but now this has gotten to my mom.
[1961.12] who do I have in this world 
except my mom and Dad?
[1972.60] My purse. Wasai,
[1976.76] my purse Is left upstairs,
[1978.80] I want to go to my mom, 
she Is not well.
[1980.84] May God make things well. 
Bring It.
[1982.32] I will bring It.
[1987.28] Aunt, Aunt,
[1989.36] I told you that something was wrong,
something was not right,
[1992.92] and what I was being scared 
of has happened.
[1994.56] Oh God, I hope everything Is well, 
what happened, my child?
[1996.52] Aunt, mom fainted.
[1998.44] What?
[1999.64] How Is your mom now?
[2001.32] She has come back from 
the hospital now
[2004.32] but I will get to know It properly once 
I go there that what has happened to her.
[2007.24] okay, okay my child don’t worry,
[2010.64] but I don’t understand that
[2012.96] how did Sister Naseema faint.
[2018.12] Because of Aunt Mehreen.
[2020.76] What do you mean 
by Aunt Mehreen?
[2025.84] Because I had told everyone that 
I am very happy at my in laws’ house,
[2030.52] my mom doesn’t know the kind 
of days I am spending here,
[2035.24] when Mom called me 
in the morning today,
[2037.48] I was talking to her and then 
Aunt Mehreen came all of a sudden
[2040.64] and started shouting on me,
[2042.08] she said whatever she felt like 
and mom heard every word,
[2046.84] now just Imagine what else would have
happened to her If she wouldn’t faint.
[2049.84] That’s it my child, 
that’s it, don’t worry,
[2052.52] do one thing, you Immediately 
go to your mom’s house,
[2055.52] even ask her from my side
[2057.12] and call Salman when 
you are on way, okay?
[2058.92] Leave immediately, go.
[2078.00] Oh God keep everything well.
[2085.04] yes.
[2098.04] Where are you going?
[2103.56] With your bag like this?
[2109.72] I am asking you something.
[2113.92] I am going to see my mom.
[2116.96] Have you never seen your mother 
ever before?
[2121.08] She fainted.
[2123.96] So, she must have been dizzied.
[2133.60] You just need an excuse to go to her
[2136.48] and she needs an excuse to call you.
[2139.00] It Is not an excuse, Aunt.
[2145.52] She fainted, she has just come back 
from the hospital
[2148.68] and all this is because of you.
[2150.60] Shut up,
[2152.56] do you even know 
what you are saying?
[2153.96] I know very well what I am saying.
[2156.96] Do you know
[2158.12] I had made an image of you 
in front of Mom
[2161.48] and you destroyed that image today,
[2170.08] my mom’s patience is destroyed too,
[2172.52] she heard everything today.
[2174.76] I don’t care if she hears, 
I am not scared of your mother.
[2180.16] You can at least respect her;
[2182.28] she is my mom.
[2185.20] She is not some unusual mother.
[2197.92] My mom is everything for me
[2203.28] and don’t even say a word against 
her ever again.
[2233.76] Now the decision will be made
[2236.16] If your mother is Important 
for you or Salman’s.
