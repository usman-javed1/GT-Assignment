[20.68] You just don’t worry at all,
[23.12] I will do as you order.
[33.88] If you don’t mind, 
may I say something?
[40.52] Sure?
[45.16] Madam’s behavior...
[49.92] Hmm,
[52.28] I understand what you are 
trying to say,
[61.12] I have been noticing too that sister in law
Shaista’s behavior is changed.
[72.48] Wasai,
[74.48] keep your eyes and ears, 
both open,
[82.00] okay now look after your work, 
there is a lot of work.
[85.92] Okay.
[123.00] Arooj is absolutely fine
[126.00] and you have become 
a grandmother.
[128.44] Yes.
[130.64] Wasai?
[131.52] Yes, Madam Sr?
[133.56] As the driver to bring 
a lot of sweets,
[136.84] Daughter has been born 
to my Salman.
[139.72] yes, yes, yes, 
I will just bring it.
[175.76] She looked exactly like you to me.
[184.84] Same eyes, same nose, 
and everything.
[195.00] Like me?
[199.80] yes.
[202.52] Obviously,
[208.36] she is the daughter of our Boss Jr,
[215.76] she must be like you only.
[244.48] I have the same doubts,
[248.52] I don’t have any proof
[252.60] but I even know
[255.52] you have enemies in this house,
[259.48] I don’t want to make you worried
[263.64] but it is important for the sake of 
my loyalty towards this house
[270.76] that I suggest you to stay cautious.
[274.88] Are you hinting towards Aunt?
[281.00] I might be,
[284.56] because when Madam Sr 
brought the soup,
[289.88] that soup fell
[293.56] and as soon as the cat had 
that leftover soup,
[298.88] she died on the spot.
[318.40] What are you thinking?
[323.88] Nothing,
[333.80] I am thinking
[337.32] about how our daughter’s future 
would be.
[344.68] Our daughter’s present is 
amazing as well
[347.88] and her future will be the best too.
[351.24] You know what?
[354.32] You have given me a huge happiness.
[359.20] That is written on your face.
[362.44] Yes.
[363.44] And on that note of happiness, 
we have arranged a party today,
[367.64] Mom is looking after 
all the arrangements.
[370.60] Wow,
[372.20] she should be looking after it,
[374.64] she has become a grandmother.
[376.64] exactly,
[378.60] she is looking after everything out of the
happiness of becoming a grandmother.
[384.04] Listen, invite everyone from the office,
[386.96] they are like our family members too.
[390.44] Learn to make friends,
[392.40] enemies are made automatically.
[562.60] What happened now?
[566.24] nothing.
[575.24] Nothing is happening according 
to my will.
[588.60] And now there is a party in this house.
[592.12] Yes, I know and some of the people 
from the office are coming as well.
[598.32] Idrees, don’t you think
[605.76] everything that is happening today 
is just like it happened before?
[626.44] For example, 
what happened before?
[631.20] You always forget,
[637.60] don’t you remember
[639.80] when Waqar had a daughter,
[649.00] and now Salman had a daughter,
[658.40] even at that time there was a 
similar sort of party,
[666.52] there were people from the office,
[669.28] there were celebrations,
[678.16] and the exact same thing is 
happening today.
[681.88] Yes, and even at that time you were 
not happy on the birth of that girl Areej
[685.44] and even today you are not happy
on the arrival of this girl.
[714.60] The behavior of younger ones is changing 
with the elders despite of you being here.
[719.52] Why?
[720.72] What happened, Shaista?
[723.72] By the way,
[725.40] even I am noticing changed behavior 
in this house,
[729.36] but I didn’t say it to anyone.
[733.60] Mom, you know that 
Salman is my son.
[737.72] Oh-ho, everyone knows that
[740.92] but what you have forgotten is that
[742.84] Salman and Mehreen loves 
each other a lot.
[746.44] You have just given birth to Salman,
[748.80] I guess you forgot this and 
Salman is just a child,
[752.68] and children do everything 
of their choice.
[755.20] will Mehreen give the same 
importance to Salman
[758.48] when she has a child of her own?
[762.08] If Salman is neglected,
[766.08] his personality will be shattered.
[768.80] Stop thinking like that, Shaista,
[771.56] no one will ignore him.
[803.76] Yes, yes,
[806.00] Mom came in the afternoon only,
[810.28] I and Salman came together.
[813.56] Thank God
[816.56] that you are fine and talking nicely.
[822.00] Mom, God just saved us,
[824.08] we had your prayers with us else,
[826.40] there were no stones left unturned.
[832.92] No stones left unturned?
[835.64] I didn’t get it, my child.
[844.88] Who did what?
[850.40] Umm,
[852.44] I will tell you later.
[862.68] Anyway, I call you because you and 
Dad our coming to our house,
[870.00] Salman has arranged a get-together at 
our home to celebrate the birth of his daughter
[877.12] and you guys have to come.
[884.24] Let it be, my child,
[886.48] I and your dad will send a lot of 
prayers your way from here only.
[898.04] If we come there,
[900.76] Mehreen will not like it at all
[911.84] and then she will bother you.
[916.76] Do you know,
[919.16] I have even started to like her
strict attitude now.
[922.56] I feel love towards her.
[930.92] Yes, my child,
[933.32] after all,
[935.48] she is your mother.
[941.56] I found the mother 
who birthed me
[952.96] and you have raised me,
[956.12] I love you equally, Mom.
[970.72] and I am so lucky to get love 
from two mothers.
[979.28] Stay blessed, my child.
[983.80] So you and Dad are coming 
in the evening
[988.44] and I have a very important work 
from you that only you can do,
[992.80] I even want to talk to you.
[995.08] Work?
[997.72] What work?
[1045.64] okay then, I will see you later.
[1048.44] Bye.
[1056.00] Madam Jr,
[1058.76] she is exactly like your childhood.
[1099.52] How can Aunt do this?
[1104.20] Someone can hate or 
dislike someone
[1110.92] but how can someone kill anyone?
[1116.20] You are very innocent, Madam Jr.
[1124.48] The people who want,
[1127.12] they are cruel enough to kill 
someone as well.
[1130.96] So then my daughter?
[1135.36] You must rest,
[1139.60] your daughter is absolutely safe.
[1145.08] Don’t worry.
[1150.80] They have kept her in baby care 
for now.
[1214.44] Greetings Madam.
[1216.04] Greetings, Mr Aslam,
[1218.56] how are you?
I am fine, Madam.
[1220.28] Have a seat.
[1222.56] So tell me,
[1224.00] how are our accounts 
coming so far?
[1225.52] everything is fine by the grace of God. 
Amazing.
[1232.36] All the staff should get all 
these cheques today.
[1239.80] Yes, sir.
[1241.60] Thank You.
[1244.08] What is all this, Salman?
[1248.48] Mom, my princess,
[1250.96] my daughter has come to this world,
[1257.08] so I thought of giving my staff 
a bonus on this happy occasion.
[1264.92] Salman, you gave bonus on 
the birth of your daughter,
[1277.48] you have told this to me 
before as well, right?
[1282.88] No, mom, I didn’t.
[1289.60] Why?
[1290.80] What happened?
[1294.16] So then
[1297.60] why do I feel that I have heard this
before somewhere too?
[1311.76] Cheque,
[1314.80] bonus,
[1318.00] happiness on the arrival 
of a daughter, birth.
[1332.96] I have seen or definitely heard it 
somewhere before.
[1339.20] No Mom, there is nothing like that, 
I guess you have some misunderstanding.
[1343.36] No, no,
[1344.76] this has happened somewhere 
before or,
[1347.20] I have seen it with my own eyes.
[1349.72] This has happened.
[1352.08] No one can deny me on this.
[1354.88] Where have I heard this?
[1402.00] excuse me, everyone,
[1404.88] may I have your attention please,
[1409.00] now comes my princess,
[1412.04] my daughter,
[1414.80] who has brought the light 
to our home.
[1419.72] Here she comes.
[1530.00] We want you to raise her.
[1554.56] I?
[1555.96] How will I be able to take care of her...
Umm..
[1558.24] Mom? 
Salman.
[1560.76] There is no one as caring as you.
[1569.16] No one can raise her better than you.
[1587.32] Now quickly tell us what have you 
named our daughter?
[1600.88] Sister Mehreen,
[1607.12] I have brought a very pretty gift 
for this little fairy.
[1612.64] If you may allow?
[1619.04] Yes, yes, you can definitely 
give it to her,
[1621.08] you have a relationship 
with her too.
[1675.08] We have named her Areej
[1694.68] and we want you to put 
this bracelet on Areej.
[1708.60] yes.
[1710.64] Salman, hold her and 
take care of her carefully,
[1713.52] meanwhile, 
I will put her gift on her.
[1756.64] So finally you named her 
by your choice?
[1759.52] yes.
[1761.12] Areej is a beautiful name.
[1825.96] What happened, Mom?
[1827.80] Salman.
[1833.44] Waqar is no longer 
in this world now.
[1837.32] My Son left me, Mehreen.
[1866.44] Mom, are you okay?
[1871.16] Mom?
[1875.20] Aunt, are you okay?
[1888.28] Mom?
[1891.00] Mom?
[1893.12] Mom, get up.
[1895.36] Wasai, ask the driver 
to take the car out.
[2011.56] Mr Salman, come with me, please.
[2027.40] Whenever anything like this happens,
[2029.92] the reaction is exactly the same,
[2034.68] because her brain cannot tolerate
 any burden at all.
[2039.76] But Doctor, nothing happened, 
it was a happy occasion,
[2043.44] my daughter was born,
[2047.24] mom didn’t take any stress
[2049.80] so how did she get unwell?
I don’t get it.
[2053.16] That is not possible, Mr Salman,
[2055.20] something has definitely happened,
[2057.28] and you know it better.
[2064.88] But there is nothing to worry about,
[2067.00] I have given her an injection,
[2068.48] and when she wakes, 
she will be normal, if God wills.
[2073.72] If God wills.
[2075.28] Come, I will drop you. 
Come.
[2112.56] I guess
[2118.16] I was around the same age
[2124.20] when I got away from my parents.
[2133.48] My life is such a riddle,
[2138.72] it might end while solving it.
[2148.08] I don’t get it,
[2152.64] who should I tell all this to?
[2157.68] I understand
[2163.72] but if Madam Sr’s mental condition
wasn’t bad
[2169.96] and there was no danger to her life,
[2176.56] I would have told the truth in at once 
and failed Madam.
[2191.00] But for now, we have to keep 
this secret as a secret.
[2200.72] When will I tell her?
[2206.12] How will I tell her?
[2211.40] My haste...
[2220.68] can become a problem for Mom.
[2232.24] No, no.
[2238.60] I have to stop myself for now.
[2246.36] I don’t know
[2250.80] how she must be now.
[2295.28] Wasai?
[2298.08] Wasai?
[2299.28] Coming, Madam Jr.
[2302.48] yes?
[2304.76] Areej is sleeping, 
you stay with her,
[2306.76] I will be right back. 
Don’t leave her alone.
[2309.60] Sure, sure, you may go.
[2329.20] Madam Areej,
[2331.44] you did wonders,
[2334.56] you came back into this house.
[2339.04] Shall I tell you something fun?
[2342.52] Madam Sr, she is your 
paternal grandmother
[2352.72] though she is your maternal 
grandmother
[2356.72] and your paternal grandmother.
