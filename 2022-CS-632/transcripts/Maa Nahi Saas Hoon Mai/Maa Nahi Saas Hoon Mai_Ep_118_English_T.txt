[24.84] Mr. Judge, I want to inform this 
honourable court that my client
[28.64] Salman Ahmad is the owner of 
such a substantial property
[32.00] that keeping track of it is no easy 
task for anyone.
[38.04] Objection, your honour.
[41.28] The property my client, Arooj Ahmad, 
has claimed,
[47.48] my esteemed friend, cannot make the 
decision or bestow title for it to anyone.
[62.76] Your honour, I request the court that
[65.20] till the decision of the disputed 
property is not made,
[68.44] it shouldn’t be associated 
with anyone.
[70.56] The defending lawyer should ensure
[72.56] that the disputed property's title 
is not given to anyone.
[91.72] This is the job of the court to decide 
who owns this property.
[95.76] Understand?
[96.88] As your order, judge.
[99.04] Sir, the property is so substantial that
anyone can have greed in their heart,
[105.68] and anyone can claim it,
[107.80] and such a greed came in the heart
of Arooj Ahmad,
[111.04] and she filed a claim to take over the property
of her husband, that is, Salman Ahmad.
[137.36] I request the honourable court 
to reject this false claim,
[144.56] and save the precious time 
of the court.
[154.04] Thank you, your honour.
[157.68] This court orders both parties
 to appear
[160.84] in the next hearing with all their 
evidence and witnesses.
[163.84] The court is adjourned 
until tomorrow.
[177.88] The court is adjourned 
until tomorrow.
[192.56] Adjourned.
[205.84] Mr. Lawyer,
[207.28] what will happen on the next hearing?
[209.56] Your mother will have to testify,
[219.20] and you be a little patient.
[221.08] Look, these are decisions of ownership,
[224.60] it takes some time.
[227.00] It requires patience.
[228.88] We are being patient, Mr. Lawyer.
[232.64] Now, you may go home and 
finalize your statements.
[242.20] The opposing counsel might ask 
challenging questions, so be prepared.
[247.04] Questions that are even more 
challenging than life?
[269.76] Come on.
[287.96] The mother and daughter must 
not have paid enough fee,
[290.40] compared to the legal services 
you are offering them.
[292.92] Sir, this is my responsibility,
[295.00] and less or more fees makes 
no difference.
[300.28] There should be justice.
[304.68] You make a good speech,
[306.72] but if you support us,
[308.52] then I can pay you the amount 
you desire.
[311.12] Sorry,
[312.48] you are thinking wrong.
[319.48] It would be better if you let this case
remain in the court.
[351.76] What happened?
Did he agree?
[354.36] No.
[355.60] He is really strong,
he won’t break so easily.
[359.24] How will he not break?
[362.08] Salman Ahmad has broken the best,
[365.12] what is he?
[367.80] You don’t worry, I will fix it all.
[371.44] Come on, let’s come.
[372.48] Come on.
[402.08] Yes, the defendant’s lawyer
[403.64] would you like to inquire something
 from Arooj Ahmad?
[440.72] Sir, the property is so substantial
[442.68] that anyone can have greed 
in their heart,
[445.64] and anyone can claim it,
[447.68] and such a greed came in the heart 
of Arooj Ahmad,
[450.96] and she filed a claim to take over 
the property of her husband,
[454.00] that is, Salman Ahmad.
[464.04] I request the honourable court
to reject this false claim,
[471.08] and save the precious time 
of the court.
[569.16] This is more than what you had 
asked for. Understand?
[572.60] Here you go.
[575.80] But remember one thing,
[577.52] we only have to scare those two.
[580.12] We have a case against them in court.
[581.96] Don’t create a new issue. 
Understand?
[584.28] I understand, sir.
[586.12] What you said will happen.
[588.80] Hmm.
[590.36] I will go.
[687.00] Brother, drive fast.
[696.40] Brother, drive fast. 
Be quick.
[699.08] Someone is following us.
[708.48] Brother, take another route. 
Take a left from here.
[796.96] Mama, open the door quickly.
[799.88] Open it quickly.
[802.84] What happened? All okay?
[804.52] Come quickly.
[809.12] What happened? 
Tell me something.
[810.84] Why are you in such a hurry?
[813.64] Some goons were following us, 
mama.
[815.92] We saved our life with difficulty 
and came home.
[818.76] God be kind.
[820.92] Who were those people,
[822.20] and why were they after 
you people?
[831.24] Who else is our enemy other than…
Wealth.
[841.00] This wealth,
[843.88] was never that important 
for brother Idrees.
[857.16] For sister in law Shaista 
and Salman.
[861.80] That for the sake of which 
these people
[864.88] have fallen below the standards
of humanity.
[869.60] Earlier they only had a doubt that all 
this would be snatched from them.
[883.64] But now, they are sure of it.
[886.80] They are sure?
[888.00] Yes, they are sure.
[889.72] Earlier, they only had a doubt
about this,
[892.28] that all this will become theirs.
[895.96] But today?
[899.12] Today, when the court proceedings 
took place,
[901.80] then their doubt changed into surety
[904.12] that all this is going to be snatched 
from them really soon.
[923.88] Okay, thank God,
[930.08] you two didn’t face any loss.
[942.80] We have faced a loss, 
sister Naseema.
[957.48] The loss of love.
[972.88] The loss of trust being broken.
[993.24] Child, Arooj, have a seat.
[996.72] I will bring water for both of you.
[1053.44] You could be so cheap that 
you got goons to follow us.
[1058.36] Stop your nonsense.
[1061.44] You dislike every person 
who is speaking,
[1064.20] and you dislike them 
even more especially
[1066.96] if they are speaking the truth.
[1073.40] And what do you think? 
Huh?
[1075.36] You will pay and buy anyone?
[1078.92] What are you saying? 
Who did I buy?
[1081.20] My lawyer.
[1083.84] Yes, so I can buy him.
[1085.28] You cannot buy him.
[1088.52] Really?
[1090.96] How can you stop me?
[1092.92] Did you forget
[1094.52] that I am the owner of this wealth
 and property.
[1099.48] This dream of yours will be 
shattered soon.
[1102.88] You are the one who is dreaming
 Mr. Salman.
[1108.92] Maybe you are forgetting that
[1111.16] my father put the entire property and
business in my name when he died.
[1117.88] And I will bury this reality in the ground.
[1121.84] Great.
[1123.56] You know this reality, 
but you don’t accept it.
[1133.16] Don’t worry,
[1134.60] I will make you accept it really 
soon as well.
[1138.00] We will see.
[1175.92] Now, do you understand how you 
became the heir of the entire property
[1180.16] and business after Arooj’s 
disappearance?
[1190.28] I will go mad.
[1192.08] No.
[1193.68] You don’t have to go mad, 
you have to use your senses.
[1198.28] Arooj is a really cunning girl
[1200.16] and also the owner of entire 
businesses and properties.
[1203.72] But she is my wife.
[1205.20] She is Mehreen’s daughter.
[1208.84] Now when the reality has 
been revealed,
[1211.48] then you don’t even expect any good
 from Mehreen, either.
[1218.16] And Arooj will stand with her mother
in such a situation.
[1286.04] Son, Salman.
[1289.92] What happened?
[1292.76] Who were you talking to with 
so much anger?
[1295.92] With Arooj.
[1308.04] What is she saying now?
[1309.76] She is saying the same nonsense,
[1315.76] that I am fighting a case against her, 
with her money.
[1319.84] Really?
[1322.32] Is this what she said?
[1332.24] So why did you listen to her?
[1334.56] You should have cut the phone.
[1336.24] I was about to cut it,
but she cut it first.
[1338.76] Strange.
[1340.88] Why is she calling now?
[1350.12] I would say, you tell this in court.
[1353.52] I spoke to the lawyer.
[1356.00] He said, she is your wife,
she can call you.
[1359.36] Hah,
[1360.64] wife.
[1363.36] This thorn will also be removed
 soon as well.
[1374.32] Don’t worry, okay?
[1378.40] They should worry, not us.
[1442.36] Yes. Yes, Mr. lawyer, end all this 
in the hearing tomorrow.
[1446.20] They have no proof that can prove
Arooj to be the owner.
[1454.68] Fine. Fine, we will meet 
in the court tomorrow.
[1460.44] Let us just win this case once,
[1471.24] then the stamp of our ownership 
will be on everything.
[1476.68] Don’t worry,
[1479.00] we are in a strong position.
[1487.64] The lawyer was saying that
[1489.44] he will thrash every witness of Arooj. 
Yes!
[1493.80] And who is Arooj’s witness?
[1495.64] Her mother, Mehreen, 
who else?
[1498.16] That’s it?
[1504.72] This case will be ours.
[1508.00] You people will see.
[1540.16] Papa?
[1542.64] Leave it. I will close it.
[1544.92] Have you seen your health?
[1546.84] Where are you going around?
[1548.40] Hey child, I went to meet 
the counsellor.
[1554.72] What is the need to meet 
the counsellor?
[1556.84] Hey, there was a need.
[1558.52] I went to ask him for his car.
[1564.88] I told him the entire matter.
[1567.56] He gave me a driver and a guard
along with the car.
[1575.60] Now we will go with him.
[1577.40] No, you will rest at home.
[1580.56] Master, Arooj is right.
[1583.04] You go inside and rest.
[1585.16] Okay fine, go.
[1587.56] You are getting late for court. 
The counsellors car is parked outside.
[1591.36] Mama, you kept your medication, right?
[1593.20] Yes, I forgot, it is kept in the drawer.
[1595.96] I will bring it.
[1598.80] By the way,
[1600.32] Master at times I am really happy
[1604.04] that you and sister Naseema 
brought up my Arooj.
[1611.20] You find the solution for every 
for every problem
[1615.16] that comes in Arooj’s path, 
so easily.
[1618.28] All parents do this, sister Mehreen.
[1621.92] No Master,
[1624.00] us parents who live in bungalows 
don’t face these daily challenges.
[1633.64] When do we have this service 
of the children in our fate.
[1638.72] Serving the children?
[1641.16] Yes, master.
[1643.56] You have to serve the children as well.
[1649.12] That’s when children serve the parents 
when they grow up.
[1659.16] You have to take care of the plant, 
to get the fruit.
[1665.24] Shall we go, mama?
[1666.68] Yes.
[1668.88] Goodbye. 
Goodbye, child.
[1763.40] Begin the proceedings of the case.
[1768.64] Mr. Judge, I would like to draw the esteemed
court’s attention to a crucial point.
[1775.80] Arooj Ahmad has claimed ownership 
of her property,
[1780.48] but no document has been presented
from the inheritance side
[1784.52] that could substantiate Arooj Ahmad’s 
ownership claim.
[1788.76] What response does the prosecution
have for this?
[1793.88] Mr. Judge, the point my learned 
friend has brought
[1798.44] to the court’s attention is 
extremely crucial,
[1802.92] and we cannot overlook it. 
However,
[1805.44] it seems there may be a misunderstanding
that we have overlooked it.
[1809.72] It would be better if you speak in simple 
words instead of using complex language.
[1814.40] Mr. Judge, I mean to say that
[1816.92] we didn’t forget the importance
of the papers.
[1830.96] Rather, it is a story based on the lack 
of authenticity of those documents.
[1836.44] No, we are hearing stories.
[1838.80] There is no reality in this.
[1841.88] Mr. Judge, I want permission to call 
my client Arooj Ahmad
[1846.24] to the witness box in regards 
to these papers.
[1848.96] Permission granted.
[1857.68] Come, Arooj.
[1885.08] Yes, madam, go ahead, 
what do you want to say?
[1889.44] Mr. Judge,
[1891.96] since the property papers were 
in my name,
[1894.76] and they were present in the same 
home where we live.
[1899.88] These people who have taken over
 this home also live there.
[1912.60] Papers getting lost or stolen from 
that home is nothing impossible.
[1918.48] Objection, Mr. Judge.
[1920.72] I don’t understand how
[1926.92] Arooj Ahmad is putting an allegation 
on my client Salman Ahmad
[1930.16] and Idrees Ahmad for stealing 
a document that doesn’t exist?
[1951.12] So, the defendant’s lawyer, 
is it not possible?
[1953.88] Madam Arooj’s objection does 
not seem entirely wrong.
[1963.76] It is possible that at some stage,
[1966.16] the ownership document was removed.
[2144.04] Arooj, you will go crazy putting in effort,
[2155.36] but you will not be able to prove anything.
[2166.00] No one can remove me from this wealth.
[2175.80] All this is mine.
[2182.12] Only, mine.
[2249.48] Yes, so Mr. Salman Ahmad,
[2251.84] you and your lawyer have been 
trying to prove from day one,
[2256.28] that my client Arooj Ahmad
[2259.92] is not the owner of her 
father’s property.
[2264.20] Really?
[2265.96] So what do you think? 
Arooj is the owner of all this?
[2281.76] I would say, absolutely.
[2283.72] I want to bring something 
in the court’s notice,
[2286.52] that is, Mr. Salman Ahmad and 
his father Idrees Ahmad
[2291.76] have taken control of the entire property
 by using a piece of paper,
[2297.64] which is a caretaking document, 
as the basis for the past twenty years.
[2313.32] Yes, so that’s how it is.
[2315.00] All this belongs to my late uncle.
[2318.64] This reveals two things.
[2321.04] Firstly, you are not the owner 
and secondly,
[2325.80] when Waqar Ahmad’s wife, 
Mehreen is alive,
[2331.08] then why is she not the owner 
of this entire property?
