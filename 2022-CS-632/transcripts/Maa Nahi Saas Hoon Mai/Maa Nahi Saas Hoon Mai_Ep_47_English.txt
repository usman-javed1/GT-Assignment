Did you call me here to show me 
this game with the paper weight? My life has become a game. And what about you playing around 
with relations? In fact, you are playing around 
with your life. What are you looking at? What has happened to you, Salman?
 Why are you acting so childish? You are such a big businessman and you went to that boy’s home? Have you ever loved? No, but why mention this here? There is a reason. But when you have never loved, how will you understand this? Okay please, let’s not talk about philosophy, 
okay? Let’s talk about something simple. You have insulted your relation with 
sister-in-law by going to Ammad’s home. My love has been insulted. I wanted an answer. So you went to his home to ask
 for an answer? And tell me something, a stranger will testify for your wife’s character? 
Huh? And whatever answer he gives you, 
will you accept it? Then what should I have done? 
Tell me. At least you shouldn’t have
 done this. This is a delicate relation, if you bang it on the ground 
so many times, I am telling you honestly,
it will break. Please man, don’t bother me more, 
I am already really worried. I am bothering you? I am supporting you. You didn’t answer me. Mr. Salman, believe me, this hot tea is more important 
than your question. Drink it. And believe me, Arooj is a good girl. Ammad, I don’t understand 
something. What? Arooj used to be so lively earlier, now she has become so quiet. Because the situation she is facing, in such situation people 
often get quiet. No, she is trying to improve 
the situation, but brother Salman has so many 
misunderstandings in his heart. Why don’t you remove those 
misunderstandings? Really? How? How do I remove them? When Arooj tells Salman, 
I am her friend, he doesn’t listen to her. I told Salman, Arooj is my friend, 
he doesn’t believe me. He only listens and agrees to those 
people who give her wrong advice. That’s it. Really? So this means we cannot do anything 
for our friend that all the misunderstandings are 
removed from brother Salman’s heart? What do we do? When Salman doesn’t want to remove
all these misunderstandings himself, then what can we do? But, we will have to do something. When will you do it?
When the time will pass? No. Before the time passes. Yes, but when? Today. Come on. You say Arooj is your love. Yes, absolutely. That’s how it is. Then why do two loving people 
need advice? Or you can that why are the discussions 
between two people who love going out even? It is useless to take advice from you. Man, why do you even need advice 
from me or anyone else? You two sit on one page, you will find a solution. I don’t want to face her. Lies. It is not about facing her. 
Your ego is at its peak. So she too has made this 
a matter of her ego. Why does she not resolve 
this issue it with me? You surprise me, Salman. You started the issue and 
sister-in-law should end it? Do you see any logic in this? So if Arooj does this, 
then what will happen? What difference will it make? Then Salman you bury this. Nasir, you know me for a long time, even if I want, I won’t be 
able to do this. Arooj, preference tells you 
about love. And I can have any number 
on your priority list, but not the first. Hmmm. You have the last number. Because when the list is made 
on the name of one person, so the first and last number 
is the same. Fine, I have seen the plan, 
you get it printed and tell Mr. Ahmad to contact me. Right, sir. Hello. Send him. Right sir. 
Thank you. Have a seat. Please. Thank you. This is Shanzay. I know this. No, you don’t know. I know this is Shanzay. If there is anything else 
apart from this tell me. You have introduced her, 
but also tell me why you have come here. I have the debt of an answer, I came to remove that. So, then why didn’t you remove 
the burden when I had asked you. Because I answer on time, 
and that time has come now. What are you people talking 
about here? Maybe I am present here, right? So involve me too. Of course, this thing cannot be completed 
without involving you. So, Mr. Salman, should I introduce Shanzay 
to you completely? Shanzay, is my future wife. I am telling you this first, 
even before Shanzay. Because I know this really well that you would be the happiest 
to know this. Anyway, goodbye. Shanzay. You didn’t like me going there, 
right? I didn’t like you going there and 
talking about that thing. It is surprising. I asked him, 
he didn’t respond to me. I am asking you, 
you are not responding. Because what you say is baseless, there can be no answer for it. And even if you get the answer, then will you recommend the punishment
for it yourself or will I do it? These people like Ammad 
consider me stupid. I am the CEO of such a
big business empire. Shanzay didn’t know 
Ammad is marrying her. The surprise on her face 
made it evident that Ammad thought of it 
at this moment to fool me and he said it on the next moment, that he is marrying Shanzay. What happened? 
What are you thinking? At times you should see things 
as much as they are visible. You don’t have to look at a beautiful 
painting on the wall and think that the paint on the wall behind 
the painting is falling off. At times, you should move away 
from the issue, considering it a reason. Leave my hand. Ammad, what did you inside? Why? What did I do? Ammad, you told brother Salman 
you are marrying me and I don’t know about this. Why? Did I not do good or 
you don’t like me? I do. Meaning, I like you, but what is this style of expressing 
your love? What can I do? 
This is my style. Really? If this is your style, then 
what will happen next? What will happen next is that 
Salman will never bother Arooj. So, this means you did 
all this for Arooj. Hmmm.. you can say that. Hmmm. Okay. Meaning, this was my 
misunderstanding. I thought you really love me. Stupid girl, call your mother and ask her where my mother is
 right now. No way. Call her. Hello mama. Mama, where are you right now? What? Hey, okay mama, 
I will talk to you later. Okay. Goodbye. See. Did you see? I can’t believe this.
How is this possible? I wanted to come myself 
for so many days, but something or the other 
would happen. But today when you called, 
then I thought I will surely go today. Look sister, as per principle, I should have come to your home. But my ailment hasn’t 
left me capable. No problem, I have come, 
it is the same thing. Actually, I wanted to talk to you 
about something. Go ahead. Shanzay and Ammad are 
really good friends, I want that we convert their friendship
 into a relation. This is a good thing, I really like Ammad as well, 
he is a good boy. Shanzay is dear to me 
like my daughter. I want that I see the happiness 
of my children in my life. You cannot trust life. Why are you saying this? Hey, we have to see the happiness 
of our children and also the happiness of 
our grandchildren. Don’t worry, God will make it fine. You kept my word. Have tea. Yes, sure. I really apologize. I am not well or else I would have 
cared for you well. Hey, hey, no, no, this is also enough.
Don’t think that. I want to talk to you. You don’t want to talk about anything, you have to ask. Obviously, you question a criminal. Criminal? I am not even accused, and you called me a criminal 
without investigation. Wow. Really? Fine, then. We will investigate. You didn’t like me going there, right? Greetings. Greetings. It is good you came. 
Come on, have a seat. Salman, I want to talk to you 
about something important. Yes, go ahead. I have made a decision. What decision? I want to call Arooj’s parents home. What for? You really disliked Arooj’s parents 
coming over. I am calling them to talk about 
what I don’t like. and I know what that is. If you know it, then why 
do you have an objection? Let me do what I want to do. 
You will not do this at all. And you will not contact 
Arooj’s parents at all. Meaning, you are ordering your mother. I am not ordering you. I just want to save this home 
from a bad decision. If you want to save this home, 
then agree to me. I cannot agree to you. My life is attached to this, that is why you accept my decision. I feel… I feel that your life and all decisions 
connected to our life are completely opposite. That’s not true, Mehreen, I had told
 Salman everything about Arooj. I had told him, that Arooj is…is… Meaning, she is such a good girl, she understands the matters, in fact, she understands a few matters 
in depth. Yes. What are the matters in the depth 
of which that Arooj can reach, but I have 
not reached there till now? Actually, the thing is Mehreen, 
if I go back in depth, I will not return. Stop. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Sorry. After so much humiliation you feel that a simple ‘sorry’ 
will finish this all, and I will forget everything. And this? What is this for? 
Reason? I didn’t like saying only sorry to you. So I thought I would give you
 this gift. and I didn’t like this style 
of yours at all. Will I forget my insult 
seeing this gift? Arooj, I can understand. 
It is my fault. I admit. I am embarrassed on my thinking. But I am saying sorry, 
I made a mistake. Please. I am really sorry, 
it will not happen again. You know, Ammad came to the office today. Ammad? Why did Ammad come? Your friend Shanzay. Yes? She and Ammad are getting married. They are getting married? Who told you? She is your friend, 
did she not tell you? Yes, both of them like each other, 
I know that. But I didn’t know 
they are getting married. Okay leave them, 
why talk about them? Today, we will only talk about 
each other. We spent a lot of time without 
happiness, Arooj. I am really sorry. Whatever happened, 
I am responsible for it. But it will not happen again. You alone are not responsible, it is because of some people and a little because of us. Okay leave it. We are going for a dinner. Let me get fresh. You too get ready. Oh wow, wow. You two are together. Where are you going? Salman is taking me for dinner. Dinner? Excuse me. You do one thing, you talk to aunt 
and come outside. I am waiting for you outside. 
Sure. Yes, Mr. Wahid. You two are going for dinner? Yes. So did you two get the visa? I mean did you take permission 
from Mehreen? You know, Salman gifted this to me. See. It looks so nice. Look at this, mama. Areej. It is so pretty. See, Mehreen. It is a really pretty name. So you gave her the name you like. Yes, because Areej is a really 
pretty name. Right, mama? Yes, it is a really pretty name. Now our home will become pleasant
because of her scent. Here mama, make Areej wear this
with your own hands. I will open it. My beloved doll. Here you go. Aunt, what are you thinking? Nothing. I was thinking how you did 
this magic… this magic of love I mean. After dinner you will tell everything 
in detail. I will ask both of you separately. Salman is a cheater when it comes 
to telling a story. Okay fine, Goodbye. Yes. Goodbye.
