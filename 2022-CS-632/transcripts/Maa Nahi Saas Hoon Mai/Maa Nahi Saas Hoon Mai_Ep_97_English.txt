That selfish Arooj and her mother 
shouldn’t get a penny. No one will be left with 
anything son. I mean, the two of them. I have spoken to the lawyer, I have given him the details 
of all the properties. We will snatch every single penny. And what did he say? Till when will he have 
the documents ready by? By today or tomorrow. I want them today. I cannot tolerate that Arooj 
in my home anymore. She tells me that all this is mine. I will show her who the owner is. Relax, son. 
Everything is under control. I will not relax, till all this gets fine. Till she doesn’t plead in front of me
 and apologize, I will not find peace. She is a weird cunning girl, at times she stands in front of me,
 at times in front of mom, at times she blames you 
for a second marriage, at times she blames you 
for corruption. Son, has someone ever been able 
to stop someone in the way? People like us change our path 
and move on, that’s it. We just let it go. I am your wife, 
this is my worth. Stop your nonsense. Your entire drama has flopped. Now come nicely and apologize 
to my parents I will not apologize to anyone, because I am right in my place. Arooj, don’t upset me further. Or else, what? Huh? What will you do? What will I do? I will do what you never even thought. One minute, today, I will show you. Look at this file. Read it. Read it. What is this? The home aunt Musarrat lives in, 
is my father’s property and the expense uncle is stealing 
from the office for his second wife. They are living off the earning 
of the office. Say all this is a lie. It is all wrong. 
Why don’t you speak up? Speak up! Arooj. Leave my son. Leave him. 
Come on, Salman. Hey, what are you saying 
sister-in-law? I am speaking the truth. Salman is my son. I gave birth to him. I gave Salman to you only 
to save your life. Now I want my Salman back, right this moment, right now! How did you dare to speak 
this nonsense? You didn’t do good, Mehreen. I will do this again and again. If you do this, then I will do it 
again and again. How dare you call my Salman 
your son? Salman is enough for Mehreen. To act like he is good. Now, how can I do all this? No. No. I am a really bad actor. I will not be able to do it. Mehreen will say one thing, 
I will say ten. Anyway, when was I a garland 
in Mehreen’s neck earlier? I will stay the way I was earlier. Wait, sister-in-law, Shaista. I had to inform you 
about something. Yes, go ahead. I have to tell you. My Salman came to me before going 
to the office today. So, what do I do? You did what you had to. The hatred you have filled in 
Salman’s mind against Arooj and I, it is all over now. He has found out who truly loves him. What is the matter, sister-in-law, 
Shaista? You are not answering me. Fine, I will also see Salman. You can see him. You can surely see him, 
when my Salman will be with me. Surely see him. Did you see, Mehreen, how I played the entire game and I won as well. What did you win? How I took back my son from 
that too will full profit. My son Salman is the only owner of this property 
and business. So you are admitting it yourself that you played this cheap trick. Earlier, you were only mad. Now you have also become stupid. And who is fooling you? Salman. She thinks that the hatred has ended. What do I tell you, mama? There are many issues in this home. You handled one problem, 
another starts. You solve the second, 
a new story starts. Leave everything else, child, tell me, is Salman good, I mean is Salman’s behaviour 
towards you good? Does he take care of you? Salman is fine, but he has 
a lot of mood swings, and then the next moment 
he realizes that yes, whatever I said was wrong,
 it was not right. Yes, child. Often men are like that. No, mama, don’t say that. I have never seen papa 
getting strict with you. It is a difference of the upbringing 
of the home, and the environment of the home. Master is anyway someone
who fears God. Then why don’t other people 
fear God? Arooj, child, is everything fine? Yes. Yes, everything is fine. I was just asking you. Hey Salman, when did you come from the office? Greetings. Greetings. I just came and like always I have come 
to your room to meet you. If you would meet Arooj first, I will not mind it. I have come for her. Really? Tell me, what is the matter? Mom, I want to take Arooj for dinner, if you allow. Yes, yes, do take her. Then you too come along. No, I am fine at home, you two spend time together. Thank you so much. By the way, Salman, Arooj has gotten very little 
comfort in this home. If you want, you can give her
happiness, so that she forgets 
all her sorrows. I am trying. I will ask her, then. 
Yes. I love you. She is sleeping. Hello. Yes, dad. Yes, I am taking Arooj for shopping. You keep the files ready. We will get it signed from her 
when we come back. Yes. Salman, shall we go? Yes, I was waiting for you
for so long. Come on. Arooj. 
Yes? May I? Thank you. Salman, I am really happy today. What? Really? Yes. Whenever you look at me with love, I feel I found all the happiness 
in the world. Then fine, I will increase your happiness further. The textile mill uncle Waqar thought 
of setting up in your name, now, I will complete that project and it will be in our daughter’s name. Areej Textile. Wow, this is a really good news. Are you happy?
Really happy. You are happy, 
so what else do I need? Thank you. Are you coming? You go ahead. I am coming. That selfish Arooj and her mother 
shouldn’t get a penny. No one will be left with anything son. I mean, the two of them. I have spoken to the lawyer, I have given him the details of 
all the properties. We will snatch every single penny. And what did he say? Till when will he have the documents
ready by? By today or tomorrow. I want them today. I cannot tolerate that Arooj 
in my home anymore. She tells me that all this is mine. I will show her who the owner is. Relax, son. 
Everything is under control. I will not relax, till all this gets fine. Till she doesn’t plead in front of 
me and apologize, I will not find peace. They should believe that 
you have changed. You cannot live without them. You really love those two. And as soon as you get the chance, you get the signature on 
all the documents. Trust me, son, as soon as the documents 
are signed, I will drag both these mother 
and daughter out of this home. Hmmm. Great idea. But do you think I will be 
able to do this? I don’t think so, I have faith that you will do it. Son, we just have worries 
for a few days, then we will only have happiness. All this will just be ours. This is the file. Our papers are after the first two. Take Arooj’s signature and 
thumb print on it. And Salman, please make sure, Arooj is not able to 
read these papers. Just take her signature on it, after that all this is ours. So, then tell me, how did you like shopping? You are really good. You too are really good.
