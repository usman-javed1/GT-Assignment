[22.30] I want to bring something 
in the court’s notice,
[25.27] that is, Mr. Salman Ahmad and 
his father Idrees Ahmad,
[30.33] have taken control of the entire 
property by using a piece of paper,
[33.77] which is a caretaking document,
[36.27] as the basis for the past 
twenty years.
[52.03] Yes, so that’s how it is.
[53.63] All this belongs to my late uncle.
[57.23] This reveals two things.
[59.63] Firstly, you are not the owner
[62.87] and secondly, 
when Waqar Ahmad’s wife,
[67.07] Mehreen is alive,
[69.70] then why is she not the owner 
of this entire property?
[86.97] Mr. Judge,
[88.77] I disagree with my friend’s argument 
on this matter.
[93.30] I don’t understand
[94.93] if he wants to make Mehreen Ahmad
 the owner of Arooj Ahmad.
[99.00] It is the same thing, Mr. Judge.
[101.77] No matter whoever is the owner 
out of these two,
[104.30] but the owner is not the one
[107.63] who has seized the property till now.
[121.37] Thank you, Mr. Salman. 
You can leave.
[123.63] Thank you very much.
[129.73] Mr. Judge,
[132.57] I seek permission to present one more 
witness for madam Arooj’s claim.
[138.93] Permission granted.
[140.63] Madam Mehreen, come.
[184.27] Yes, madam, go ahead, 
say what you want to say.
[191.03] Mr. Judge,
[193.73] there is no doubt in this,
[197.40] that this entire business, wealth,
[201.87] belonged to my late husband
 Waqar Ahmad.
[211.63] When our only daughter was born, 
then…
[288.10] Look at this, mama.
[295.20] Areej.
[296.80] It is so beautiful. See, Mehreen.
[302.27] The name is really beautiful.
[305.13] So, you named her by
your liking, right?
[308.17] Yes,
[309.63] because Areej is a really 
beautiful name.
[312.13] Right, mama?
[313.53] Yes, it is a beautiful name, son.
[317.03] Now our whole home will be 
filled with her scent.
[324.60] Here, mama,
[325.93] put it on Areej’s wrist with your hands.
[328.17] I will take it out.
[331.03] My little doll.
[333.13] Here you go.
[355.63] Mehreen,
[358.20] Waqar has left us and gone.
[364.47] He left?
[367.90] Where did he go?
[370.43] Waqar is no longer in this world.
[374.33] My son left, Mehreen.
[378.47] Waqar…
[380.53] Waqar…
[383.10] Call Waqar.
[386.67] Call Waqar. Call him.
[430.23] Mr. Judge,
[433.07] this is the entire story.
[442.00] Arooj is the only owner of my late 
husband Waqar Ahmad’s
[450.73] entire business and property.
[464.83] The rest were just caretakers
[490.87] Does the defendant’s lawyer you wish
to ask something from the witness?
[494.93] No, sir I don’t want to ask any question
from Mehreen Ahmad,
[501.00] the reason is that her statement 
has no legal standing.
[521.77] And I want to show you 
a report, Mr. Judge.
[554.93] Mr. Judge, this report clearly states
[557.23] that Mehreen Ahmad is a 
mental patient.
[569.23] Whatever stories she has told us,
[571.43] she has just wasted 
the court’s time with it.
[573.73] There is nothing in it 
that can be believable.
[576.93] Objection your honour.
[583.87] I admit, Mehreen Ahmad was 
a mental patient,
[587.67] but now she is completely healthy.
[589.70] Mr. Judge, we will have to run 
another case to inquire
[592.70] about who is mentally fit and 
who is not fit.
[595.00] Thank you, sir.
[599.50] This court is adjourned for
 half an hour.
[604.63] If someone has any proof 
or witness,
[607.20] they should present them to 
the court immediately.
[610.70] Adjourned.
[673.13] Be strong, mama.
[675.90] If you continue to cry like this,
[678.43] then I too will lose my strength.
[682.60] What do I do, if I don’t cry?
[688.60] Salman must be laughing proving me
to be a mental patient.
[697.33] How can he do this?
[706.27] You still don’t believe what 
Salman is capable of?
[713.10] He came in my arms, 
from sister in law Shaista’s arms.
[721.67] I brought him up every moment,
[724.33] and made grow up so big,
[727.87] and he must be laughing 
at his mother.
[732.07] How?
[738.07] I am here.
[740.67] Your daughter is with you.
[745.53] Yes, you are with me.
[748.00] My own daughter.
[752.10] But what use am I as a mother,
[755.93] if I couldn't even testify for 
my own daughter?
[760.37] You are a mother, who is standing
 with me in such a time.
[772.23] A mother never leaves 
her daughter alone.
[775.33] That is the type of mother you are.
[777.50] Don’t worry,
[783.37] such questions are asked in court.
[790.57] Those people are putting 
in their entire effort,
[792.83] but we will not step back either. 
We will try our best too.
[796.47] I will assure of one thing,
[798.87] whether we win or lose the case,
[802.33] they won’t get anything either.
[827.70] Be strong,
[829.97] everything will be fine.
[944.47] Wow, son, Salman, wow.
[946.17] You are more sensible 
than your father.
[947.67] You have made all the preparations.
[949.30] And as far as Mehreen is concerned,
she is mad.
[951.67] Who will listen to a mad person?
Huh?
[963.77] The world will see the condition of Arooj
[965.67] and her mother will be in 
after losing the case.
[968.53] Hmmm.
[969.70] Hey, half an hour has passed.
[972.73] Mr. Lawyer, finish this case today.
[974.57] Yes, just watch.
[975.93] I also have to earn my fee lawfully too.
[977.83] Yes. 
Come on.
[978.90] Come on. 
Come on. Come, son.
[1039.70] Master, God be kind,
[1043.07] Arooj and sister Mehreen have 
still not come from court.
[1047.17] You get late in such matters, 
Naseema.
[1056.00] I am really scared.
[1058.47] Those people can do anything.
[1061.93] Don’t worry,
[1064.63] hope for the best.
[1068.90] Amen.
[1074.10] Is it not possible that
[1076.53] Arooj give them everything 
as charity for her life.
[1082.20] And charity increases the life,
[1085.53] and I am saying all this 
for Arooj’s protection.
[1089.90] No Naseema,
[1092.00] you shouldn’t leave your right,
[1094.50] nor should you stop anyone’s right.
[1097.63] You just pray that Arooj 
wins this case.
[1102.37] Amen.
[1139.83] If a modest person steps back 
from something,
[1143.37] then the immodest person thinks
that he is a coward.
[1147.20] And you know,
[1149.27] not raising your voice for your right 
is a big ungratefulness towards God.
[1159.70] I have decided.
[1162.27] I will stand up for my right
[1165.57] and now I will not listen 
to anyone of you.
[1222.47] I can say with surety
[1225.33] that this girl Arooj’s desire is nothing
but greed for wealth and lies.
[1241.20] The decision of lies and greed will be
made in a little while.
[1244.03] You wait here.
[1246.13] I seek permission from the honourable court
to present another witness for this claim.
[1252.60] Permission granted.
[1254.30] Thank you very much. 
You call her.
[1344.60] Mr. Judge, this is Wasai, 
daughter of Aslam.
[1348.67] She has spent thirty years of her life
as a servant in Waqar Ahmad’s home,
[1353.63] where Arooj Ahmad was born.
[1359.47] And the circle of life turned 
in such a way,
[1361.40] that she got married and came back
to that same home.
[1365.43] She knows about the entire condition
and situation of that home.
[1368.77] I would request the court to give her 
permission to speak about that.
[1374.07] Wasai, you tell us.
[1378.40] yes, tell us, what do you know?
[1381.20] Sir,
[1383.57] it is just me,
[1386.47] who knows everything.
[1398.67] I have seen the rise of elder madam
in that home,
[1406.13] when her daughter was born.
[1428.07] Then I saw younger madam,
[1431.57] becoming a daughter in law,
[1435.67] and also as the wife of little master.
[1445.33] And time shows such colours,
[1450.37] today, the real owners of the home 
are out of the home.
[1482.27] They should be given their right.
[1486.57] This is a court room, madam.
[1491.53] Your emotional speech will 
not work here.
[1494.30] Let her talk.
[1498.00] Emotions are natural when talking 
about human and human relations.
[1519.63] Yes, madam, 
what do you want to say?
[1523.77] Mr. Judge,
[1526.03] twenty-two years ago,
[1529.67] elder sir, put all his wealth
[1535.30] in the name of his daughter,
younger madam, in front of you.
[1558.00] Defendant’s lawyer,
[1559.37] do you want to ask Wasai something?
[1564.57] Mr. Judge, this woman said 
what she wanted to,
[1567.60] but is this woman worthy that 
we believe her testimony.
[1571.43] What do you say, Mr. Idrees?
[1574.73] Yes. Yes. Yes, Mr. Judge,
[1577.90] she is surely our old servant,
[1579.97] but we fired her from the job 
some time back due to theft.
[1611.63] Her habit of theft was increasing
[1614.80] and she is testifying falsely today,
to take revenge for that.
[1629.80] Since she was our old servant,
[1632.73] we didn’t find it right to file a report 
with the police.
[1645.63] Wasai,
[1650.83] did you steal at Mr. Idrees’ home?
Did he drag you out of his home?
[1654.17] Yes,
[1655.63] but I didn’t steal anything.
[1659.10] I didn’t steal anything.
[1661.27] Who admits after stealing 
whether they stole or not.
[1668.93] Mr. Judge, the biggest of lies 
is something,
[1671.90] Arooj Ahmad has spoken.
[1680.87] I request you to call Arooj Ahmad 
to the witness box,
[1685.07] so that her lies can be revealed.
[1705.73] The two witnesses Arooj presented 
to prove her innocence,
[1710.07] they are in front of you.
[1711.73] One of them is a mental patient,
[1713.57] and the other has an allegation 
of theft on her.
[1731.80] Apart from that, 
she has a copy of a paper,
[1734.67] according to which she is the owner.
[1737.07] And even the original document for that
[1739.90] has still not been found, Mr. Judge.
[1742.77] Mr. Judge, I want to say something.
[1745.97] Say what you want to by coming
in the witness box.
[1749.47] Sure.
[1796.53] Mr. Judge,
[1798.27] neither is my mother a mental patient,
[1800.73] and neither has Wasai stolen anything.
[1807.93] All these are allegations being put on 
my witnesses to make them insignificant.
[1828.23] Mr. Judge,
[1829.80] we got the copy of the stamp paper 
with difficulty.
[1841.63] I am Arooj Ahmad,
[1843.87] late Waqar Ahmad’s lost daughter.
[1851.47] I am the owner of this entire wealth, 
Mr. Judge.
[1869.07] Okay fine, we will accept for 
a few moments
[1872.27] that the testimony of both 
the women is true
[1874.33] and the copy of the stamp paper is fine.
[1879.67] As for being the daughter of Waqar 
Ahmad and Mehreen Ahmad,
[1882.93] who went missing 
twenty-two years ago,
[1888.93] it was when Arooj Ahmad 
married Salman Ahmad
[1892.40] and came to this home
[1893.90] that she heard the story 
of a lost girl.
[1896.40] She had a greed in her mind,
[1897.97] then she started getting herself called 
as a lost child, to seize the entire wealth.
[1923.67] And Mr. Judge, this is not the real deal.
[1926.27] The real thing is that Arooj Ahmad
[1928.47] is not the daughter of Waqar Ahmad
 and Mehreen Ahmad.
[1956.33] Therefore, I request you to expedite 
the dismissal of this case based on deceit
[1960.70] and impose the strictest possible 
punishment on Arooj Ahmad in the fraud case.
[1967.40] thank you, Sir.
[2032.10] The court is adjourned 
for two weeks.
[2055.10] We are adjourned for next 
couple of weeks.
[2059.03] Adjourned.
[2097.57] What will happen now, Mr. Lawyer?
[2100.10] Will the law punish my daughter?
[2105.30] Nothing like that will happen.
[2107.60] Even if claim is rejected,
[2109.40] still court will not give Arooj 
any punishment.
[2121.77] The issue is that Salman Ahmad 
and his lawyer
[2125.30] are presenting something against every 
witness of ours, that the court is accepting.
[2135.53] Now the next hearing will be 
the final hearing,
[2138.90] and if Arooj’s claim is not proven 
to be true, then…
[2143.27] Do you even have to prove the truth, 
Mr. Lawyer?
[2147.33] Yes.
[2149.40] Don’t worry,
[2151.93] we will win this case.
[2164.43] The deserving always gets 
their right.
[2167.23] Even if it is in the control 
of tyrants for ages!
[2170.87] Yes, that’s how it will be.
[2179.47] What will we do now, Arooj?
[2181.37] Do whatever you want,
[2188.87] it will be of no benefit.
[2199.00] I will deprive you people of 
every single penny.
[2212.53] There is still time Arooj,
[2214.80] plead forgiveness from me.
[2218.03] Who knows, I might forgive you.
[2235.97] I didn’t bring you up in this manner,
 Salman.
[2249.47] Firstly, you are lying
[2253.73] and you are also standing 
strong on it?
[2264.30] Mama,
[2266.27] don’t waste your tears 
in front of a stone.
[2275.83] Come on.
[2278.13] Come on, Wasai.
[2280.30] Sure.
[2293.13] Stone.
