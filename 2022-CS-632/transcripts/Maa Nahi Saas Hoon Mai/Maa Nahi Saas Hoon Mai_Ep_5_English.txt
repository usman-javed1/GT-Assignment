Urooj. Urooj, listen to me. I don’t want to hear anything. But I want to talk to you. I am sorry. Please, come sit in the car. Say what you want quickly, I want to get off at the roundabout. Urooj, there is nothing like 
you are thinking. Believe me you are the only girl 
in the world, in front of whom, I am helpless. The reason for being helpless. I love you. Urooj, look at me. Urooj, I am telling you, look at me. What are you doing? I am asking you. I want to marry you. Will you marry me? I cannot give you any answer 
for this question, my parents will decide this. Now stop the car. Urooj, listen…
Will you stop the car? Okay, I am stopping it. And I know rich people like you well. Who only want to impress girls 
by showing off their wealth. Will you marry me? I cannot give you any answer 
for this question, my parents will decide this. Elder madam, I have served food. Did you tell Mr. Salman 
that dinner is ready? Yes, I asked him, he is saying he is not in the mood to eat. Salman, knows I cannot have dinner 
without him. I will check on him myself. Sure. Salman. Salman, are you feeling okay? You didn’t even eat food. I am fine. There is surely something. Wont you even tell your mama? There is something wrong. Something has happened. Is all okay? Are you fine? What happened? Mama, I am in love. Love? Yes, I am in love. Salman, you are in love? How? Urooj, there is nothing like 
you are thinking. Believe me you are the only girl 
in the world, in front of whom, I am helpless. I love you. I want to marry you. Will you marry me? By the way, Salman doesn’t look that bad either. He is handsome. I had never even thought about this, that my son can also love someone. He can also love someone else 
other than me? This means that Salman can love someone else 
apart from me. Where is Mr. Salman? Little master is coming, madam. Good morning. Good morning. What is the matter mom? You seem in a bad mood. What you said last night has really 
worried me, Salman. Worried? Mom, your son is in love. You should be happy and 
you are worried. You will have a love marriage? I have only loved. You will get me married. Whoever that girl is, you will not marry her. This is my decision. Mom, look…
I told you. That’s it. Do you see, Mehreen? What happened? What did Mehreen do? She is saying she will not let 
Salman marry out of his liking. So why do you get upset? This is a matter between Mehreen
 and Salman.. How is this a matter between 
Mehreen and Salman. If my son wants to marry out his liking, then who is Mehreen to stop him? His mother. I am his mother. 
Lower your voice. Why do you forget that Salman has been
 her child from the start. So will Mehreen make all the decisions
of Salman’s life? She has always done it and 
she will do it now too. I am going to the office, 
I am getting late. What are you thinking about, 
my love? Hello. When did you come? I have been here for a long time, 
where are you lost? Nothing man. I am really hurt. Who hurt my brother? Mama didn’t like me falling in love. She said no. All mothers do that, and then they agree themselves. 
Don’t worry. Mama is different. 
She is really stubborn. Are you sure she won’t agree? She won’t agree at all. There is nothing like that. She will agree
in a day or two, don’t worry. I hope what you are saying is true. Okay, look, the weather is so nice. Order coffee, we will chill a little. 
Fix your mood. Man, you know what the thing is? I cannot upset mama and I cannot even leave Urooj. What do I do, then? Okay, I will order the coffee. Hello. Two coffees, please. Thank you. I don’t understand anything. Relax. Relax a little. Come sister. Come. All okay? You came to my home after a long time. You had forgotten the way to my home. Sit. Sit. Hey, you don’t invite me, I thought about you myself, 
that’s why I came. Hey, it is your own home. Come whenever you want. When do I have time? I get the proposal fixed for one girl, so people are standing in line for another. If I get this one married,
 the other is waiting. Hey, you know well that I get the proposals 
fixed for all the children in the neighbourhood. It is my responsibility. I thought of your Urooj. What is she doing nowadays? You have a really pretty daughter. She must have completed her 
education, right? What do you think? Do you want to marry her or not? Right now, she wants to do a job, and we don’t say no to her either. Huh? You will make your daughter do a job? What are you saying? It doesn’t take long for girls to grow up. And what do you want her 
to do a job for? Will you eat her earning all your life? Sister, what are you saying? What is my Urooj’s age right now? When I get a reasonable proposal, we will not say no. Hey, a reasonable proposal is not 
hanging on the trees, that you break it and bring it. You have to search for it. You have to go to four home. You have to ask people. Your shoes wear out, that’s when you find a good proposal. And I am here. Listen to me, I will tell you the best of proposals. We will. We will. When the time comes, 
we will take your service. But sister, let the time come. Time? What time will come? What time are you waiting for? And time passes just like that,
 you won’t even know. Yes. Okay. Okay. You see, if you have a good proposal 
in your eyes, then tell me. Yes, yes, why not? 
She is my own daughter. I will find the best of the best proposal
for my daughter. Okay tell me something, do you serve tea or water or not? Bring me tea. I will bring it. I will bring it. Hey, also get biscuits and samosas. They are being made fresh 
in the corner shop, send someone and get them. Fine. Hear one more thing, sister. Now you have asked me 
for the proposal, so we will have to visit. It is not easy to go in a rickshaw. I was saying, also bring some advance money, I will find a proposal soon. Yes, yes, go. Go. I understand. I will bring it. Oh people today have become 
really miserly. They don’t know how they should 
give money, they think their work will be done for free.
That’s not how it works. Will I do everyone’s work for free? Mom, I am just asking you what 
objection do you have on this wedding? I have no objection on you 
getting married, but I don’t like you falling in love. What are you saying? I will marry the one I like, right? You will surely get married Salman but not with the girl you like, you will get married to the girl I like. Look mom, if you meet her once, I am sure 
you will really like her. I am telling you. This will not happen. What will not happen? You won’t understand, Salman. Then make me understand, 
I am listening. Leave it. I said, leave it. I will get you married to the girl I like, it is my final decision. 
Understand? Really? Then fine, also hear my decision. If I get married, then I will only marry Urooj or else I will not marry anyone. I have no objection on 
you getting married, but I don’t like you falling in love. You will surely get married Salman but not with the girl you like, you will get married to the girl I like. You won’t understand, Salman. Then make me understand, 
I am listening. Leave it. I said, leave it. I will get you married to the girl I like, it is my final decision. Understand? You take one or two days off, rest a little. You will be fine. No Naseema, there is a lot of work. We are going to have exams soon. Hey, you sit. I will see. Yes? Greetings. Greetings. I want to meet Mr. Shoaib. Forgive me, son. 
I didn’t recognize you. |My name is Salman. You don’t know me, 
but Mr. Shoaib knows me. Kindly let me meet him. Mama. Mama. Who has come? Child, there is some man, 
he is asking for your father. Come. Come inside, child. Come. Come, child. Come. 
This way. You have a seat, 
I will bring master. Yes, thank you. Yes? Hey, Mr. Salman, you? You came to our modest home? Greetings. Greetings. Have a seat. Seema arrange for tea quickly. No there is no need for that. You please have a seat. Son, I had to come to thank you, but I got unwell, that is why 
I couldn’t come. Oh, so how are you feeling now? Now, I am fine, thank God. Master doesn’t get tired of praising you. Son, you did something so good. You helped the children. 
Hey, no need to praise me, this was my responsibility. Actually, today I need your help. Yes, go ahead Mr. Salman. Actually, the thing is that I like your daughter. I have come with a proposal for her. If you people don’t have 
an objection, then. I have an objection. How did you even dare to say this? I think you are not in your senses, mister. I am in my senses, and I know well what I am saying. You know nothing, and coming like this you have insulted
my parents and me. It would be better for you that 
you leave from this home right now. Look, you listen… Did you not hear what I said? 
You leave my home. Urooj. I have an objection. How did you even dare to say this? I think you are not in your senses, mister. You know nothing, and coming like this you have 
insulted my parents and me. It would be better for you that you leave from this home right now. Look, you listen… Did you not hear what I said? 
You leave my home. When me and your papa were talking, then what was the need 
for you to talk, Urooj? So mama, there is a way to talk. What does he think of us? Look child, proposals coming to the homes 
that have daughters, is nothing unique. It is surely not something unique. But the way he came. The method he adopted, it is something unique. Hey, someone would be there 
in the family, at least one family member, he should
have brought someone along. Child, it is possible he has 
no one in his family. There is no chance. This is the problem of this man. He only thinks about himself. What do you mean? Did you know him from earlier? Mama, I know such boys well, and his mention has given me
 a headache. I am going to make tea, 
will you have it? You have a seat, I will make and cool your anger. 
Understand? This is nothing new. 
You get proposals. My beloved, mama, 
you are really innocent, you know nothing. Come on, you sit, and Urooj will make you have 
strong tea, today. Okay fine, go and make it. First sit. Okay fine, I will sit. Make good tea and bring it. 
I will bring it. God, give my daughter a good fate. May she get a really good home, 
where she has importance. You went to that girl’s home, 
that too alone? So you tell me, 
what should I have done? You surprise me, Salman. I mean, you don’t think 
before doing anything. No one was trying to understand me, so I had to go alone. No, so what happened?
Did you find her? I know I made a mistake, but I had no other option. Why are you being so hasty? Is she getting married? 
Has the groom come to her doorstep? What would her family be thinking? You ruined everything. Tell me, did I come to you 
to hear all this? There is no point of coming to me now. In fact, there is no point 
in going to anyone. You have hit your own foot 
with the axe, you will not get her now. 
Enough! Don’t say that. Say anything, but not this. I love Urooj a lot, I will get her at any cost. You will lose her because of 
this behavior. All this happened cause of 
mama’s insistence. Okay, come on, let’s go out somewhere. 
Please, man. No man. 
Come on. I am not in the mood, man. 
Come on, please, please, please. Hmmm. Sister-in-law Shaista, 
it smells really good. Today, I have cooked everything 
my son likes. Salman will be really happy today. I have made all this food 
with a lot of love. Anyone can cook,
 sister-in-law, Shaista. The real thing is about choice. I know well what my son likes. You cooked it when I told you. You are right. 
You told me. Yes, Wasai? Elder madam, little master is not coming for food? Why? Why is he not coming for food? Did you not tell him that his mother
has gotten food he likes made? Yes, I told him, but he is saying he is not hungry. Okay fine, I will take care of him myself. I think you are not in your senses, mister. and coming like this you have 
insulted my parents and me. It would be better for you that you leave from this home right now. Look, you listen… Did you not hear what I said? 
You leave my home. Salman, come on, have dinner, please. I don’t want to eat. Why? Why don’t you want to eat? What am I asking you.
