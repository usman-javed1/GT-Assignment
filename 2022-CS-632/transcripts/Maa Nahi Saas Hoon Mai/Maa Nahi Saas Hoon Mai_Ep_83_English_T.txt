[23.08] Look son,
[30.72] now that Shaista has 
uncovered the secret,
[33.64] listen carefully,
[44.96] I am not your uncle,
[47.84] I am your father
[70.00] and Shaista is your mother.
[84.16] This cannot happen,
[105.68] you guys will make me go mad!
[125.16] I think the facts you are trying 
to prove to be the truth are a lie
[136.68] and the facts which you are calling 
lies are the biggest truth of my life,
[139.80] she is my mother!
[166.44] Wait a minute.
[221.28] This is your birth certificate
[234.40] which the hospital gave us 
when you were born.
[249.40] All the documents after this 
are under Waqar’s name.
[294.76] Now do you believe me, Son?
[315.72] I am your mother, 
just hug me once…
[324.16] Don’t take a step forward!
[357.84] Look! Did you see?
[360.84] He still didn’t call me ‘Mother’.
[363.32] Shaista, pull yourself together,
[367.16] give him some time.
[535.32] Aunty!
[538.16] Aunty, what happened? 
Open your eyes.
[540.52] Are you alright?
[542.84] Get up,
[545.08] get up.
[557.44] Sit here, slowly.
[560.68] Wasai! Pull your feet up.
[576.00] Wasai!
[579.48] Are you okay?
[582.32] Wasai, come quickly.
[588.12] Yes, young Madam.
[590.48] Go and call Salman.
[592.96] Okay.
[594.52] No!
[596.04] There is no need to call anyone,
[597.84] I don’t need anyone.
[599.64] No one needs to call anyone.
[601.12] Go! All of you go.
 All of you go.
[603.68] You should go, and 
you should go as well.
[639.28] I told you to go.
[642.20] I don't need anyone right now, Go!
[788.00] Salman,
[791.44] what are you trying to find?
[795.84] I am trying to find myself,
[808.68] I have lost myself.
[811.32] You are not lost,
[814.12] you have just been found.
[815.96] Stop your nonsense!
[822.00] I don’t want to hear anything. 
Go away from here!
[831.52] Aunt Mehreen is not well,
[836.96] she is in her room.
[910.68] I will talk to you later.
[924.76] Salman!
Wait Shaista!
[926.56] Wait!
[928.48] Let him go, let him go.
[1039.32] Leave my son,
[1041.04] leave, come Salman.
[1042.44] What? What are you saying, 
sister-in-law?
[1045.16] I am telling the truth.
[1047.28] Salman is my son, 
I gave birth to him.
[1052.52] I gave Salman to you,
[1055.80] just to save your life.
[1064.40] Now I want my Salman back,
[1067.52] right here, right now!
[1076.80] How dare you utter such nonsense?
[1081.72] You did not do the right thing,
 Mehreen!
[1084.88] I will do this again and again,
[1087.44] if you will do this then I will do 
this again and again.
[1090.72] How dare you call Salman 
your son?
[1093.76] Because Salman is my son!
[1117.24] I’m really sorry.
[1120.36] I don’t know what happens to me
and then everything gets ruined.
[1130.76] This is my fault
[1133.16] and I admit it.
[1136.52] As of now,
[1140.80] I want to stay with my parents.
[1145.96] But why?
[1150.48] I want to find my parents,
[1155.68] I get lost in myself in that house,
[1159.40] how will I be able to find 
someone else?
[1162.72] I will help you find them,
[1165.32] I am here with you.
[1175.52] I was trying to be Urooj’s support,
[1189.12] your parents will be found,
[1196.68] but,
[1202.52] in this mess of thoughts,
[1209.16] I lost myself.
[1220.40] In the festival of life,
[1226.52] I lost the hand of my own family and
[1232.00] I got separated.
[1238.96] I am alone now.
[1301.76] What was the reason behind 
whatever you said to Mom?
[1306.08] Even though you know how 
possessive Mom is for me,
[1308.72] she cannot tolerate such a thing 
even as a joke!
[1314.60] And I don’t know why I am 
saying this to you
[1316.80] because you are aware of 
Mom’s mental health,
[1326.28] then, why did you try to prove this 
lie to be a truth in front of her?
[1330.08] This is not a lie, Son.
[1332.60] This is the truth.
[1334.36] This is not a film or drama where 
I will agree with whatever you are saying.
[1339.56] I will not believe what you are saying,
you are lying, this is not the truth.
[1389.64] Did you see?
[1402.44] What happened?
[1406.28] You think that
[1408.00] you did a good job by telling 
Salman everything?
[1413.20] He had to know.
[1419.28] If your conspiracy had 
not been revealed
[1422.76] then you would have never 
thought about telling him.
[1426.56] I did what I thought was right.
[1438.04] He is my son,
[1440.04] Salman is my son!
[1445.04] Despite knowing the fact 
that you are his mother,
[1450.24] he didn’t hug you even once!
[1466.72] What happened?
[1468.48] Are you shocked?
[1481.56] This is exactly what I wanted 
you to understand.
[1490.80] But your intentions are impure!
[1539.40] No,
[1541.88] my intentions are not impure.
[1545.88] No,
[1547.32] Salman is my son.
[1549.68] Salman is my son! 
Salman is my son.
[1555.56] He is my son!
[1558.60] He is only my son.
[1778.00] This is not a lie, son.
[1780.60] This is the truth.
[1782.36] You are not Mehreen’s 
but my son!
[1788.32] Mehreen is not your mother, 
I am your mother.
[1791.32] Enough!
[1797.72] Don’t say anything after this.
[1802.60] This is not a film or drama where 
I will agree with whatever you are saying.
[1806.96] How shall I make you believe
[1810.08] that you are my son
and I am your mother?
[1841.44] No, tell him Idrees, 
tell him I am not lying.
[1848.08] Look son,
[1853.20] now that Shaista has 
uncovered the secret,
[1856.32] listen carefully,
[1862.32] I am not your uncle,
[1865.28] I am your father,
[1872.44] and Shaista is your mother.
[1915.52] This is your birth certificate
[1920.20] which the hospital gave us
 when you were born.
[1927.72] All the documents after this 
are under Waqar’s name.
[1935.92] Now, do you believe me, Son?
[1945.76] I am your mother,
[1947.60] just hug me once…
[1977.88] Wasai,
[1980.64] you are getting worried 
for no reason.
[1983.48] Everything is going 
in the right direction.
[1986.04] How is it going right?
[1990.08] Everyone in the house has become
distant from one another.
[1993.92] They have not become distant,
[1995.84] they have just been exposed 
to one another
[2001.96] and it’s a good thing,
[2004.00] I got my mother and 
Salman got his mother.
[2007.28] No, no young Madam,
[2009.84] you don’t understand!
[2017.12] What young master got,
[2019.52] he is not accepting her 
as his mother,
[2027.48] and when you will tell elder Madam,
[2034.76] then she will not accept you 
as her daughter.
