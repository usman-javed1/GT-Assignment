Where does that happen? That you should give all the property, all the business to a woman who is mentally unstable, she doesn’t know herself that who is this person who gave
all the property to her. What are you trying to say? Why don’t you understand? The second sharer in the property, 
where is he? Waqar’s all property will obviously 
belong to his wife and daughter. So where is the daughter? We cannot even say she is dead. Okay I will admit what you are saying but our Salman, what about him? That Mehreen doesn’t let go off her lap, what about that Salman? Now even mom has ordered that Salman is Mehreen’s son but what will my Salman get? Just think, Mehreen has lost her memory, Areej is missing, we don’t even know if she is alive or dead and Mehreen thinks Salman is her son, then who does everything belong to? Your Salman’s. Oh yes, I didn’t think this way. Idrees is right, Salman will get everything, My Salman will. Whatever I have thought will happen. It’s okay if Salman’s name is not there 
in the documents, but he is the only heir of the entire 
property and business. Now, what difference does it make 
if I raise Salman or Mehreen. I have kept your lunchbox in your bag, I will check your lunch box 
when you come home, I want the lunch finished, okay? Yes, mom. 
Good boy. Take a lot of care of yourself 
my baby, my life. Here, here run run run, come here. I will catch you. Hey. Salman? Salman? What happened mom? Caught my Salman. Mom, this is not fair, 
this is cheating. No matter if you call it cheating or what?
Mom caught Salman, now Salman will catch mom, okay? Okay.
Come, try your best now. What is this? This is a clock that is put on the wall. Very good and what is this? 
Kite. Kite. How does the kite fly? We make it fly then some other kite cuts it 
then it comes back flying to us. Good girl. And what is this? Turtles, they live in water and if they don’t like something 
they put their face in their shell. Yeah, and what is this? This is a bird that flies in the sky. Very good. 
You are very intelligent. Go, my child, Urooj, 
take care of yourself, I will call you. Okay, fine. 
Come on. Bye. 
Bye, my child. Are you blind? Can’t you see such a huge car? Sir its your fault. You were coming from the wrong side. You hit my car and on top of that 
you are arguing with me? Move, move, leave him. I am asking you to leave him. Aren’t you ashamed of raising hands 
on a weak man? You commit a mistake first and 
then you are hitting him? Do remember while driving that 
human beings walk on this road too, but rich people like you 
don’t care about that. Can’t you hear what I am saying? Leave him. What if I don’t? So then just say you don’t understand 
when someone talks to you politely, leave his collar, 
would you leave or not? Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave. Uncle, are you okay? 
I am fine. Did you get hurt. 
I am okay. Brother, take him and 
give him water. Greetings mom. Greetings, you are home, my child? yes. It was too hot today, right? Don’t do this mom. Yes, it was hot. Is everything all right, 
Urooj, my child? Why? What do you think? I can read your face, 
I am your mother, did something happen? All this? Yes, something did happen. Oh God! Hope all is well, what happened? Mom, I think a rich person is very sure that poor people shouldn’t exist 
in this world and poor people are just born to tolerate 
the power of a rich man in this world. Urooj, tell me properly what happened? Tell me everything is detail. Mom, I was standing on the road, a boy came in a huge car and started 
beating a man on a bike, and people were just standing there 
and watching this whole mockery, no one was saying anything and I was seeing it myself that the poor man
 on the bike wasn’t at fault. Oh God! God forbid, did you get involved in this whole fight? If I didn’t get involved that boy would have beaten 
the poor guy so much but listen to the fun part, why are you worried? When I went to him and ask him 
why are you hitting him and move away, it felt like the boy went in to a shock, he didn’t say anything just kept 
on looking at me quietly and he was just silent. Urooj, my child, these boys are the spoiled brats 
of rich parents, this world is full of them. Tell me something, how many people 
will you stop? Mom, if something wrong is 
happening in front of me, I will try my best to stop it. My child, people keep grudges, 
you tell me, why are you jumping in 
someone else’s fire? Mom, fire can be put off. Okay, go change your clothes, I will make something cold for you. And yes, today I am making my doll’s 
favorite Biryani for her. Wow, it will be so much fun. Where is dad? I don’t see him? He is out for work, And he said 
he will come back late. It has been exact 7 years 
to mom’s death, time is flying by so fast, it used to seem impossible to live 
in this house when mom passed away, we will get suffocated here. Even I miss mom a lot, sister in law but what can we do, we cannot die with the dead. I used to think of leaving this home 
after mom passed away. I cannot even think that sister in law, every corner of this house has the memories
 of my Salman’s childhood. But sister in law Shaista, how can you feel this love? Because you don’t have a child. Wasai? What did you break? They don’t even know how to work. Wasai? Wasai? What have you done? You broke 
my Salman’s picture? Madam, it just slipped out of my hands 
while I was cleaning it. Forgive me. Wasai, don’t you have strength 
in your hands? Yes? Go, go away from here else I will do something, Wasai. let me just clean the glass. Wasai? Can’t you hear? Go, go away from here and don’t ever touch the belongings 
of my Salman ever again. My child’s pictures. What is all this? Sir Salman, this is not my fault. So is it my fault? Tell me something? All this was happening under 
your supervision, right? Yes, sir, but… But the fault is not yours, 
that is mine. Sir, I never said that. 
You are fired. Sir, what are you saying? Go away from here. Leave. Salman, this is not fair. You are taking out someone else’s 
anger on someone else, you fired a 20-year-old employee 
without any reason for a stranger girl. She is not a stranger. Then who was she? 
Do you even know her? I don’t, but I will get to know her, very closely? What is so special about her? It feels like I know her from before but met her for the first time. I don’t expect such nonsense from 
such a huge businessman of the city. You won’t get it. Salman, you fired Mr Quddus from job? Really? So he wants you to request on his behalf? No he didn’t speak to me 
but I got the news, so I thought you should may be 
reconsider your decision. Uncle, you know if I take a decision once, 
there is no going back. My child, loss becomes mandatory when ego 
and pride comes in the business. profit or loss, I will accept it. And by the way, don’t you trust me? Why not? Of course I do. So then it’s okay, just relax. What happened on your hand Salman? This? Nothing. What do you mean by nothing? If nothing has happened 
then why this bandage? Yes, son, show it to me, 
you have been hurt. Sister in law Shaista, when I am asking Salman then 
what is the need for you to ask him? So don’t I even have the right 
to ask him? His mother is present here, 
so you don’t have any right. I am asking you something. I said nothing happened. You guys keep on asking the same 
question over and over again. What do you want? 
I shouldn’t eat food? Okay, I won’t. Salman, what happened? Salman, 
sit and eat.. Sal… Sister in law Shaista, all of this 
has happened because of you. What have I done? What was the need for you
 to ask Salman? You ruined all his mood. And brother Idrees, you, you must talk about the office 
matters in office, else you know Salman never reacts 
like this on anything that I say. My son is just… My son, my son, 
my son all the time! Stay quiet Shaista. How many times have I told you
 but you won’t listen, you have ruined the whole 
environment of the house. Why are you standing here? 
Pick up all this. Okay. So then just say you don’t understand
 when someone talks to you politely, leave his collar, would you leave or not? My daughter did the right thing, we should always stand with right 
and against what’s wrong, it is our duty. Did you see mom? I don’t know why mom is always scared. you are our only daughter, to be honest, you are our everything so I will obviously be scared. Mom, love makes a person strong, 
brave and courageous. It might but that doesn’t happen here. indeed, love makes a person brave 
and courageous. Urooj, your mother has a sensitive heart 
and mind too. Yes, yes, you are the only intelligent one, 
Master. Mom, dad is pulling your leg. Oh yes, I have a news, I forgot telling. I have an interview call tomorrow. Oh wow. From where? A multinational company, 
it is an amazing opportunity dad. My daughter will definitely get successful. If God wills. Let me just get this job once then all of us will go for an international trip. Oh wow. If God wills. My child, have food, you taken so little. You raise your hands on a weak man? You commit a mistake first and then 
you are hitting him? Do remember while driving that 
human beings walk on this road too, but rich people like you 
don’t care about that. Hi Salman? Hello? What are you doing here? 
Come on, join us. You may go. I am not in the mood. Why are you showing attitude,
 let’s join us. I said I am not in the mood, go away. Okay, sorry. Have fun. Are you okay? No, I am not feeling well. Come let’s chill. I have to go. We have kept this party for you and you are leaving like this. 
This is not fair. I said I am not feeling well. But I have arranged all this for you. I know, dude, I will pay for all. Wasai? Did you prepare master’s breakfast? Yes. Okay, I will go check him, even last night my son left without eating 
due to their nonsensical conversation. Okay. Good morning. Good morning. Come, 
let’s have breakfast. Mom, I am already very late, 
I will have it in office. But this wrong… Mom, I have to go, see you. 
Hey Salman? It’s not good to leave home 
empty stomach. Salman? Salman? How are you leaving 
without breakfast my child? Salman? Salman? Salman,
 listen to me, son. You look worried again today? Master, whenever I get thought, I start feeling very heavy. I have a fear that eats me, the day Urooj finds out the reality, what will happen Master? She will never get to know and who will tell her? Don’t worry for no reason. Come home early, you sit with friends for so long. Yes, yes, I will come early. Listen, tell Urooj, why does she interfere 
in others business? Life is very hard, Naseema Begum, the land is very narrow for cowards. My daughter is smart enough to know what to say when and how, so you don’t have to worry. Mom, dad, I am leaving. We are coming, my child. 
Come. Okay my daughter, 
in God’s protection. Pray that my interview goes very well, mom. It will go very well, don’t worry at all, 
if God wills. If God wills. Okay I am leaving. My child, wait. 
yes, I will drop you to the stop, 
I am going there too. Okay. 
Okay, Naseema? Come. Are you mad? I mean you will find that girl at the same 
place again in this big city? yes she will. You are out of your mind, brother. Okay, that is impossible though but just because you are my brother, 
go, good luck. My heart says that she will come, she will definitely come. So, here she is. What? I will call you later.
