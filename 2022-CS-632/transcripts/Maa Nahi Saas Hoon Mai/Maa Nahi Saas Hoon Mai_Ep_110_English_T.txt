[36.60] Arooj.
[45.07] What are you thinking?
[49.77] I am thinking that
[53.60] papa knows everything 
about this attack.
[65.87] But I don’t know why,
[69.17] he doesn’t want to say 
anything about this.
[72.43] Yes, Arooj.
[75.03] Master didn’t say a word about 
a single moment of this incident.
[81.80] and maybe he doesn’t want 
to talk about this
[85.60] because he feels that 
his daughter Arooj
[88.97] will start disliking his in-laws.
[95.23] Yes, Arooj.
[103.63] He is thinking like every 
good father.
[110.50] And then there is that father,
[113.10] uncle Idrees,
[121.30] who wants to ruin his son’s life 
in his greed for money.
[204.33] No, no, Salman don’t do this.
[206.07] Stop them, Salman. 
Hey, where are you taking it?
[208.20] Salman. 
Stop them, Salman.
[210.63] Where are they taking my bike?
[212.30] Salman.
[213.40] Salman, don’t do this. Look…
[229.33] What happened?
[231.37] Why did you stop?
[233.17] Hit me.
[235.53] I would have surely slapped you,
[237.47] if the mark of the slap from 
last night not left your face.
[247.03] Why did you come here?
[248.30] And I knew you would do this.
[254.97] That’s why I followed you 
and came here.
[258.10] Who asked you to come here?
[261.20] Child, I wanted to talk to Salman.
[358.57] Let the sunlight come, papa.
[362.33] Child, I want that there is 
always light in your life.
[368.33] Amen.
[386.53] How is the pain? 
Are you better?
[389.63] I am absolutely fine, child.
[394.00] Thank God.
[403.40] I didn’t ask you about this 
yesterday.
[413.80] I was scared.
[418.13] But then I kept on thinking 
all night long.
[424.10] What did my daughter think?
[428.80] That when the officer asked you,
[434.53] if you doubt someone,
[442.50] then you said you don’t 
doubt anyone.
[445.57] Yes, I am right.
[450.30] You should have taken 
Salman’s name.
[453.70] Why should I have taken 
his name?
[463.53] What proof do I have 
for this allegation?
[466.40] Proof?
[468.37] You should have taken his name,
[469.97] it was my responsibility 
to gather the proof.
[473.20] No, child, Arooj.
[476.63] I will not be disheartened till 
the last ray of hope.
[493.37] Do you still have some hope?
[497.67] Salman will come back in your life.
[510.33] I want to save your home.
[514.53] I want to see you happily married.
[580.87] I want to make my last attempt.
[585.30] Maybe I can change Salman.
[591.50] Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t go through the police station.
[600.50] I will try my best to save my home.
[606.90] Even after so much happened?
[622.37] Only for the sake of my daughter.
[627.63] I think the same way.
[632.20] You reduced the burden on 
my heart by saying this.
[642.17] This matter will not get resolved
[645.43] the way you are thinking about it.
[649.53] Yes, I have an idea,
[654.97] but that fear doesn’t leave my heart.
[661.93] If we feel scared and sit quietly,
[668.30] then we won’t be able to do 
anything for Arooj.
[674.53] If Arooj gets everything and 
loses her relation with Salman,
[680.43] then it will be a deal made in loss.
[684.57] This relation is between those two.
[690.63] It cannot be saved with 
one person sacrificing.
[696.23] Master,
[698.10] Salman has forgotten
[700.87] that he also has a Arooj in his life.
[729.37] So, sir got free.
[732.63] You finally found time 
to come to me?
[734.57] Hey,
[735.57] I just came, no salutations, no greetings,
you are talking to me in this tone.
[739.63] To get greeted,
[741.50] you have to do things to be 
greeted, Idrees
[743.87] and you…
Hey, Mussarat,
[746.27] earlier you were not 
this ill-mannered.
[748.30] Because I didn’t know of your
 hypocrisy earlier.
[750.77] You lied to me so much, Idrees,
[754.40] that I have started to hate myself 
on the decision to marry you.
[758.97] Hey, Mussarat, you are my wife.
[761.33] Second.
[762.30] The second wife is also a wife, 
Mussarat.
[764.80] Yes, absolutely.
[766.13] The first wife is staying with 
luxuries in a big home,
[772.63] and me and my son are left 
locked up in this small home.
[777.57] Why are you in such a bad mood? 
What is the reason?
[780.97] My fate is bad.
[782.20] Hey, everything will be fine.
[783.57] That’s it, Idrees. That’s it.
[785.57] I don’t want to hear 
another lie from you.
[787.57] I am tired of hearing your lies.
[790.50] I am surprised.
[794.47] You had shown me 
so many dreams.
[804.30] You have lied to me 
so much, Idrees.
[807.27] The first lie is
[812.13] the lie of telling the world about 
our secret marriage.
[819.67] The second lie is that of leaving
your wife Shaista
[822.60] and your son and taking me 
to that mansion.
[832.80] And the third lie,
[834.87] the dreams of all of Arooj’s property.
[837.80] What all had I thought of Idrees.
[846.83] It is all a lie. 
You are a really big cheat.
[850.27] Hey, stop your nonsense. 
You are speaking without thinking.
[852.80] Enough, Idrees,
[853.73] I don’t want to talk to you about 
anything. Go from here.
[855.73] I…
Get out.
[857.03] When you don’t find anyone, 
you come to me.
[859.23] Leave from here.
Leave.
[863.70] Fine.
[895.93] Did you not have shame keeping
a relation with a married man?
[901.33] Not relation, marriage.
[904.87] You are lying.
[908.90] You have put a crack 
in my home.
[914.13] I didn’t know.
[916.53] Idrees told me he has 
divorced his wife,
[919.50] he is alone.
[925.03] and you believe him?
[928.00] If a man cries and asks 
a woman for sympathy,
[935.30] then the woman becomes helpless.
[939.53] I thought there is a man troubled 
by circumstances,
[943.27] a worn-out person, 
who needs support.
[947.37] What?
[949.73] He is still left to be worn-out.
[1027.27] Nothing happened to Master Shoaib.
[1029.33] He has even gone home.
[1032.10] Master Shoaib, 
wasn’t even our target.
[1035.33] What are you saying? 
Huh?
[1039.67] Master Shoaib is Arooj’s 
biggest strength.
[1042.77] She does everything with his advice.
[1047.37] This entire family has become
 a problem for us.
[1052.63] If we would have gotten rid 
of Master Shoaib,
[1055.83] Arooj would have become weak.
[1060.63] Master will get scared now.
[1062.53] How will he get scared?
[1065.63] Shaista is right,
[1068.53] we will have to think ten times before
making any plan, anything can happen.
[1074.67] You know, 
you people surprise me.
[1076.97] I mean, you people made such a 
big plan to just scare master Shoaib.
[1081.50] This is the limit.
[1083.77] Don’t worry,
[1085.30] it won’t happen this time. 
Yes.
[1095.30] Do you still think you will 
take care of this matter?
[1098.77] You won’t be able to do anything,
[1100.83] and that Arooj will dance 
on our heads.
[1105.10] How is this possible? 
She has good fate;
[1107.23] Arooj won’t get saved every time.
[1111.50] Will someone tell me,
[1115.57] what is going on?
[1121.03] What are you two doing?
[1123.77] Tell me as well, I too should find out.
[1126.57] You too hear it out,
[1128.17] and show us the amazing feat 
you can achieve.
[1131.57] What tone are you talking to me in?
[1137.57] Mom, dad’s plan failed.
[1140.03] Arooj survived.
[1149.23] I don’t know when this Arooj 
will have her downfall.
[1191.57] Where did mama go?
[1194.70] Even her handbag is not here,
[1197.57] then where did she go?
[1200.77] She doesn’t even know anyone 
in this area.
[1208.13] Arooj.
[1213.27] What are you thinking?
[1218.17] I am thinking that
[1221.83] papa knows everything 
about this attack.
[1229.53] But I don’t know why,
[1232.60] he doesn’t want to say 
anything about it.
[1236.17] Yes, Arooj.
[1238.60] Master didn’t say a word about 
a single moment of this incident.
[1245.40] and maybe he doesn’t want 
to talk about this
[1249.23] because he feels that his daughter 
Arooj will start disliking his in-laws.
[1258.70] Yes, Arooj.
[1262.77] He is thinking like every good father.
[1269.60] Did she…
[1302.57] Mama.
[1304.87] Mama.
[1306.20] Where is mama?
[1308.17] Sister Mehreen must be 
in the room.
[1310.40] I checked inside, 
she is not there.
[1314.47] She is not there?
[1321.70] I had knocked on her door 
for breakfast as well,
[1325.43] but she didn’t come out.
[1331.73] I thought she must be sleeping.
[1335.87] Really?
[1339.00] I will go check in the room.
[1396.90] Arooj,
[1416.57] if you feel that
[1419.57] I made the wrong decision 
to leave home,
[1423.57] then we will go back home.
[1426.97] No,
[1429.13] I am standing with you 
in your decision.
[1436.63] Now, we will see
[1441.53] whatever happens.
[1521.10] Where can sister Mehreen go?
[1524.23] I should have understood it then,
[1526.87] that she is going somewhere.
[1529.87] When?
[1530.83] When she came to get 
a veil from me.
[1533.50] I didn’t even ask her out
of formality,
[1535.27] as to why she needs the veil.
[1537.93] Hey, so you should have asked. 
She is emotional.
[1541.13] She can make any emotional decision.
[1543.57] What emotional decision?
[1546.67] Nothing.
[1549.80] Did she go back home, child?
[1557.23] How can sister Mehreen make 
such a decision after so many fights.
[1565.70] She can do anything 
in Salman’s love.
[1569.27] She won’t see profit or loss.
[1571.87] What will happen now?
[1573.40] If those people, 
mistreat sister Mehreen, then?
[1579.50] I think I should go there myself.
[1583.70] No.
[1585.73] Why?
[1587.53] It is possible, she is not there.
[1590.43] Yes, but she is not answering 
my phone either.
[1595.27] You continue to call
[1599.63] and if you don’t get to talk to her,
[1601.07] then both of us will go together 
and see,
[1602.97] but I will not let you go 
between those animals.
[1626.27] Yes, go ahead, Arooj.
[1627.70] Hello, mama.
[1630.47] Where are you?
[1631.73] I have been trying to contact you
 for so long.
[1634.03] You are not even home. 
Where did you go?
[1636.37] Arooj, I came for some work.
[1639.07] but at least tell me 
where you are.
[1644.90] Child, I am telling you,
[1646.43] I have left for some work, 
I will come back.
[1649.10] Why are you not telling me 
where you are right now.
[1658.03] I am so worried,
[1659.63] I have been calling you continuously,
you are not answering it.
[1662.03] Arooj, why do you get after me?
[1664.73] I am telling you, I am fine.
[1666.90] I was in a rickshaw, so I didn’t 
hear your phone ring.
[1686.60] Arooj, child, I will come home 
and talk to you.
[1689.07] Bye. Bye.
[1691.53] Hello, mama I…
[1693.63] hello?
[1699.00] What happened, Arooj, child?
[1709.37] Arooj, what happened? 
Where is she?
[1729.23] Is everything okay?
[1731.27] Why are you walking like this?
I am fine. I am fine.
[1737.67] Where did you go?
[1741.27] I went to meet Salman.
[1751.13] To meet Salman?
[1753.23] Why?
[1756.50] To talk about your issue.
[1768.37] I told him to save his home 
from being ruined.
[1777.93] Then?
[1778.83] Then what did he say?
[1781.73] He cursed me.
[1791.13] And he pushed me down.
[1826.47] Hello.
[1828.20] Yes, Mr. Arsalan.
[1830.03] Yes, we have left the office, 
and we are reaching you in a while.
[1832.97] And today we will finalize this deal.
[1835.43] Yes. 
Son.
[1837.07] Forgive me.
[1838.23] Fine, I am coming to you 
in a while. Okay.
[1842.23] Son, that…
[1842.97] I said forgive me! 
Go from here!
[1872.47] You couldn’t recognize 
these eyes, right?
[1879.10] I went crazy crying 
in your memory.
[1891.10] I am your mother.
[1894.37] I have brought you up.
[1897.90] I have done your upbringing. 
I don’t want to talk to you about anything.
[1900.97] But I want to talk to you Salman.
[1907.33] I want to talk.
[1912.67] I didn’t bring you up like this,
[1916.90] that you stop caring about people.
[1925.10] And that you only become 
the slave of your stubbornness.
[1929.70] I didn’t bring you up like this.
[1932.40] Why are you disturbing me?
Huh?
[1939.57] Disturb?
[1942.97] We are disturbing you?
[1946.83] You have disturbed all of us, 
Salman.
[1954.20] After me and Arooj,
[1956.43] you have become the enemy of
[1958.77] innocent people like sister Naseema
and master Shoaib.
[1961.70] I didn’t do anything,
[1964.33] and even if I have done something,
[1966.23] then I am not answerable 
to your useless questions.
[1971.13] I don’t want to make you 
answerable for anything, either.
[1979.53] Just tell me,
[1989.83] don’t you miss your mother?
[1993.87] Don’t you miss her?
[1997.10] I don’t have an answer for 
these useless things.
