[21.92] Salman?
[30.08] You said you are not going
 to do this marriage?
[37.20] And aunt even bought the clothes.
[44.40] It means you kept
 me unaware and
[47.08] didn’t even tell me anything.
[49.16] Whatever is happening,
 let it happen
[54.56] but remember one thing,
[58.72] this marriage won’t take place,
[66.44] it wouldn’t happen at any cost.
[124.44] I never even thought that such situation 
will happen in my life, Shanzey.
[131.92] Arooj, such situations are very 
common when there is no child,
[136.28] you just have courage 
and take care of yourself.
[140.44] I am being courageous,
[143.72] Salman is with me for now
[147.40] but Aunt Mehreen creates 
a new problem everyday.
[152.24] What is the new problem now?
[154.64] She has gotten a new
 dress made for me,
[157.48] and it is her wish that
[159.00] I should sit with Alizey
 in the new dress.
[162.92] What?
[164.24] No, tell me that is a lie.
[167.48] I mean how could she do that?
[170.44] Is she a mental patient?
[173.48] I mean there is no one in that house
 that can stop that woman?
[177.96] everyone is helpless 
in front of her.
[181.64] Arooj by the way let
 me tell you one thing,
[183.64] your home seems like
 a TV serial to me,
[188.80] I mean everyone is doing 
whatever they feel like
[191.20] and no one is there to question.
[194.76] I don’t know
[196.36] what is going on in my life.
[199.08] Tell me have you told your 
parents about all this?
[203.36] I mean about all this drama?
[205.20] No, not at all,
[207.56] I won’t tell them anything,
[209.60] I don’t want
[211.20] them to go through 
all this trouble like me.
[213.68] Wow,
[214.68] amazing madam Arooj,
[216.24] you are saying as if they 
wouldn’t find it out themselves.
[220.12] I will see it when it happens
[226.00] but I won’t tell them 
anything myself.
[229.28] Arooj,
[230.48] I can only comfort you 
in such situation,
[234.76] I can pray for you that
[237.64] may God make everything right.
[240.80] Okay then I will call you later.
[244.32] Bye.
[245.72] Okay, take care then, bye.
[282.92] I have tried to talk to both of them,
[285.00] Salman is not understanding
[286.24] and Mehreen is not going 
to move an inch either.
[288.76] Mehreen very stubborn,
[291.44] she always stays adamant
 on wrong stuff.
[295.16] I am worried about Salman.
[298.56] Why?
[301.04] He is absolutely 
right in his point,
[303.16] whatever he wants 
should happen.
[305.76] The problem is that if 
we listen to Salman,
[307.96] we will have to disagree
 with Mehreen.
[310.72] So then let’s disagree.
[312.20] She will get shock
[313.40] and I don’t know
[313.88] if she will be able to bear
 the shock or not,
[315.84] what if she gets unwell?
[318.80] Okay then,
[320.16] let’s live with this fear all our lives.
[326.04] This is so strange that
[327.60] everyone should bear everything
[330.52] but Mehreen shouldn’t get 
any kind of shock.
[333.64] Shaista, that is the problem.
[335.44] This is not problem, 
Mehreen is the problem.
[338.00] She is a problem but 
there is no solution of it,
[340.84] the entire house gets affected.
[345.64] I am just worried thinking that
[349.52] what must Arooj’s 
noble parents think of us?
[353.88] That what sort of a family 
we belong to?
[357.28] We are so helpless that 
we cannot do anything,
[360.04] there is Mehreen’s wish 
at one end
[361.92] and the at the other end
 Salman and Arooj’s life.
[365.04] No Idrees,
[366.68] it is you who has 
stopped me else I,
[370.36] I won’t let Mehreen play
 with others' life like this.
[412.40] Did you call me?
[414.16] Hmm.
[416.28] You were gifted the gold set of our 
late mother on your marriage, right?
[421.04] Yes, absolutely.
[424.72] Return it back to me.
[428.68] To you?
[431.16] But why?
[432.60] because I said it,
[434.00] return it, means return it.
[437.56] But Mom gave it to
 Salman’s bride.
[444.16] Salman’s bride will only 
wear it now as well.
[450.40] I will gift the set to Alizey now.
[470.28] Okay.
[474.44] When you have given
 Salman to Alizey then
[478.92] that set is a very worthless thing.
[482.60] I will give it to you.
[483.96] What do you mean by 
I will give it to you?
[486.60] Give it to me right now,
[490.60] in fact, do one thing,
[491.36] go and give it to Alizey yourself
[499.00] so I can also see
[500.60] how that set looks on Alizey,
[508.72] it didn’t look good on you at all.
[528.68] Okay.
[530.36] And listen,
[532.60] don’t roam around with that face, 
it is such a happy wedding environment at home.
[540.44] Can one be happy in such a situation?
[543.16] Whoever is my Salman’s well-wisher,
[545.84] they will definitely be happy
[552.96] and I am noticing
[555.08] who is sincere towards this 
home and my Salman.
[602.24] Come in.
[612.24] For you.
[615.00] What is it?
[616.20] Look at it yourself.
[618.80] Okay.
[630.28] Wow.
[638.96] Is this gold?
[640.20] It is a gold set for you
[645.32] but for me, it is made with dignity.
[649.20] Is it from your side?
[652.36] Not at all,
[656.36] it is the traditional set of mom that
[660.12] is being passed on to you now.
[662.36] Thank you,
[663.96] it is an honor for me.
[669.12] you know how to say this word
[673.68] but you don’t know its meaning.
[679.76] What are you trying to say?
[686.12] You were my sympathizer
[690.24] but not anymore,
[693.52] you are the reason of my pain now.
[697.44] You are taking me wrong again.
[699.12] No,
[700.80] now I get you absolutely right
[705.00] and you are doing exactly
[707.16] what you planned and came here,
[711.92] you have achieved a lot of work
 in the name of friendship.
[717.36] Look if you feel it was 
my plan
[721.16] then this plan will be 
completed in two days
[724.28] then I will be Salman’s wife
[728.00] so then think whatever 
you want to,
[735.08] in fact, you have been very 
late in understanding it,
[739.24] you should have understood
 it a long time back.
[759.68] But thank you for this.
[766.24] Wow,
[770.92] I really like it.
[796.32] I have reached the limits 
of patience, Salman,
[806.16] until when do I have 
to bear this pain?
[865.44] I know you are in pain,
[869.32] trust me,
[872.56] I have been going through
 the same pain.
[877.68] I even gave the mom’s 
set to Alizey.
[885.64] You gave it to Alizey?
[888.12] But why?
[894.44] Aunt Mehreen asked me to.
[903.20] Mom didn’t do right.
[905.40] Salman,
[908.80] I will I will get destroyed 
between her rights and wrongs.
[914.44] Arooj, nothing like 
that will happen.
[916.92] I won’t let anything 
happen to you.
[921.04] In the end, whatever 
I will want will happen.
[923.20] Until when?
[925.40] Salman, until when will you 
give me these comforts?
[928.92] You know that
[932.72] there are just two days
 left in your and
[937.92] Alizey’s wedding and
 my trust being broken.
[943.40] Arooj, 2 days are a lot.
[959.32] I believe it when you 
make me believe it
[967.12] but I feel that you are 
gradually refusing.
[976.28] What do you mean?
[981.92] You are unable to refuse at once.
[986.32] Arooj, trust me,
[990.88] nothing like that will happen,
[994.12] you are my love.
[1001.64] Tell me, Salman,
[1005.92] which will be my 
room after two days?
[1009.36] Where will I live?
[1011.12] Arooj, no one will take
 away your room from you.
[1038.00] She took the owner of my 
home from me,
[1045.56] the room doesn’t matter.
[1052.88] Nothing like this will happen.
[1060.12] No one will come between 
you and me,
[1065.44] I promise you.
[1122.28] Salman.
[1135.84] You are here?
[1137.04] I was waiting for you inside.
[1139.48] Look at this,
[1140.88] how do you like the color?
[1142.16] I don’t want to see anything,
[1146.36] you are making our lives colorless.
[1148.76] I want to bring colors to your
 life and all of ours.
[1152.48] Just imagine,
[1154.04] how will it look when the colors of 
the voices of kids will spread here.
[1156.72] I don’t want to listen to anything,
[1157.84] I don’t want to listen 
to anything at all.
[1161.80] You just answer my question.
[1163.68] I too just want to listen 
to you, Salman,
[1166.48] but tell me this why didn’t you invite 
your office people to the wedding?
[1170.76] Mom, please,
[1174.28] come out of your false
 world of dreams,
[1177.76] whatever you want,
 it will never happen.
[1182.36] Whatever I want 
will happen, Salman.
[1186.04] Okay.
[1188.16] It looks like the manager
 didn’t tell you that
[1190.24] I have canceled all the
 invitations for tomorrow.
[1195.92] Mom,
[1197.72] I am very happy with Arooj
[1200.88] and I will spend the rest 
of my life with Arooj only
[1206.80] I will not marry Alizey at all
[1212.64] and this is my final decision.
[1291.92] Salman?
[1294.32] Salman?
[1296.48] Where are you Salman?
[1297.76] Quickly come down.
[1299.16] Sister in law Shaista,
[1300.60] brother Idrees.
[1309.32] Where are you? Quickly come out.
[1315.08] Arooj?
[1316.08] Hmm?
[1316.88] Arooj?
[1317.76] Hmm?
[1318.92] Immediately come down,
 mom is calling.
[1321.40] What happened?
 Is everything all right?
[1322.56] I don’t know I will go and check.
[1339.92] Mehreen, what happened?
[1341.72] Is everything all right?
[1342.96] Mom, what happened? 
Is everything all right?
[1345.64] I am leaving this house.
[1352.84] Leaving this house? But…
[1355.40] You just stay quiet.
[1356.88] You won’t say anything,
[1358.28] I am mad at you.
[1360.20] You guys did what you wanted to.
[1365.84] Now I am leaving this house
[1367.20] and no one will stop me.
[1370.64] Now you guys tell me,
[1371.92] how will I face the guests tomorrow?
[1386.52] You are not going anywhere, aunt.
[1404.12] This is your house,
[1407.40] and you will stay here only.
[1415.76] Arooj,
[1418.08] you know what is mom 
adamant about?
[1422.52] I know Salman,
[1427.76] and I also know that
[1429.08] you are fighting a battle 
with aunt in love with me.
[1437.28] I cannot see you worried.
[1447.08] This marriage will happen, aunt,
[1464.84] and where you want,
[1470.96] it will happen there only.
[1485.44] Arooj.
[1546.12] Do you see what is 
going on in this house?
[1573.00] I can’t believe that
[1576.00] everything happened so easily?
[1584.16] You are smiling?
[1586.64] I am still unable to understand
[1588.76] what happened last night?
[1592.40] This is Salman’s love 
for her mother,
[1597.72] I knew it that
[1600.28] my Salman won’t let her mother 
leave he house so easily.
[1606.16] You are right.
[1612.16] But Aunt Salman 
just stopped you,
[1618.88] it’s still Arooj who gave the
 permission for marriage.
[1624.08] She was helpless,
[1629.60] she knew that
[1631.84] Salman could leave her
[1634.80] but never his mother.
[1639.44] Yes
[1641.36] that is what I was thinking
 Arooj is not that coward,
[1648.44] Anyway, stop talking about Arooj,
[1653.64] tell me are you happy?
[1657.84] You are about to be 
my Salman’s wife.
[1663.56] Thank you, Aunt,
[1665.04] thank you so much,
[1668.36] all this has been possible
 because of you
[1672.08] so thank you very, very much.
[1676.48] But remember one thing Alizey,
[1680.48] I am getting you married to Salman
[1684.08] just for the sake of Salman’s child.
[1698.76] And, what if I am like Arooj too?
[1708.40] Impossible.
[1711.04] All the girls cannot 
be like Arooj.
[1719.04] Okay go and do the 
wedding preparations.
[1722.52] Thank you, thank you once again.
[1767.24] I knew you would lose
[1769.92] before your last ball.
[1772.60] You tried so hard and worried
 so much, but no luck,
[1777.96] the decision that you 
have taken now,
[1779.36] you should have taken that earlier,
[1780.84] it would have saved
 you some time.
[1783.56] Move from my way.
[1785.24] You will have to move
 from my way now,
[1789.04] why will I move?
 I am in your way now.
[1795.12] Hey listen to this,
[1796.88] it is a very important thing,
[1799.96] because I am a new bride now
[1802.56] and the room will be mine,
[1809.12] what will you have?
[1812.08] You know do one thing,
[1813.72] make arrangements for 
yourself in some corner,
[1820.76] it is just a matter of
 a few days, Arooj,
[1823.88] then Aunt Mehreen
 and Salman
[1827.68] will go to the US with me forever 
along with their entire business,
[1832.48] so please
[1834.84] make arrangements
 for yourself, okay?
[1876.00] You haven’t spoken 
since last night,
[1878.32] until when will you stay quiet?
[1884.00] Arooj, what you did last 
night wasn’t good.
[1892.80] I cannot see you weak like this,
[1897.16] the mockery we are 
facing because of aunt
[1900.28] I was unable to bear it.
[1902.48] You are getting emotional, Arooj,
[1905.48] do you know that
[1907.12] after this marriage our 
lives will completely change?
[1914.04] Why are you saying that?
[1917.60] Arooj,
[1920.16] love and attention 
can never be shared
[1924.92] and neither do I love Alizey,
[1927.16] nor I can give her attention,
[1934.04] now tell me,
[1936.20] do you have an answer 
to what I said?
[1940.96] I do have an answer,
[1949.28] it is better to divide the 
love rather than lose it
[1953.12] and I am even happy 
with half of your love.
[1957.08] Arooj, but I need your
 complete love.
[1965.04] Half yours half mine,
[1967.52] makes it a whole love, right?
[2011.84] I didn’t understand your decision,
[2017.60] and you never even consulted me?
[2023.64] I didn’t want to worry you and dad.
[2026.72] So aren’t we worried now?
[2031.24] What could have I done, mom?
[2036.84] The girl who cannot give a child,
[2044.68] how could she save her marriage?
[2047.80] And Salman,
[2050.44] what is his reaction about all this?
[2059.80] He is not happy either
[2067.00] but what can he do?
[2070.56] He cannot even deny it.
[2077.44] Do you know mom,
[2080.00] I only supported 
Aunt Mehreen so
[2085.24] Salman’s honor and dignity 
don’t get compromised.
[2096.56] Aunt Mehreen won’t change.
[2101.84] Your mother in law is
 actually a mother in law,
[2107.92] she doesn’t have the capability to 
be someone’s daughter’s mother,
[2120.76] so I guess that is why
[2123.32] God didn’t give her a daughter.
[2131.04] I guess,
[2136.08] I don’t know that
[2141.52] but I did what I thought was right
[2150.24] but now I know one thing,
[2155.24] I will not back out from
 my decision now.
[2159.40] You are my intelligent daughter
[2162.92] and now that you have 
taken a decision,
[2167.04] I won’t question your courage,
[2175.00] whatever is in your fate.
[2181.32] Mothers of daughters live
 in the hopes of good fate.
