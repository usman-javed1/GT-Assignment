[22.36] Dad,
[24.40] it was good that you were 
lying there in the room,
[26.24] what was the need to come here?
[28.08] My child, I start feeling very 
heavy if I keep on lying
[32.56] Sirt carefully.
[38.12] Dad, are you okay?
[39.96] Yes, I am fine.
[42.24] How do you feel now?
[45.12] I feel better now.
[48.56] If you may allow,
[50.28] shall I take an appointment 
from another doctor?
[52.32] Let’s get you checked
 up once more?
[54.28] No my child, that is not needed,
[57.56] I am fine,
[61.00] its just a little weakness,
[64.00] it will go away with time.
[68.52] She is a daughter so she 
panics very quickly,
[73.16] she takes a little illness 
of her father like it’s very huge.
[77.28] That is how the hearts 
of daughters are.
[79.68] True.
[82.56] Urooj?
[83.52] Yes?
[84.76] Shall we leave?
[85.72] Umm…
[86.80] How can you just leave, son?
[88.96] Why so soon?
[90.36] Just sit for a while, at least.
[91.68] Urooj,
[93.04] go see what your mother is doing,
[95.60] tell her to make tea.
[96.92] Okay, I will do that.
[97.40] Go, go.
[101.24] So, son, you tell?
[114.44] I have gotten very late for office,
[116.12] just get the breakfast ready quickly.
[118.16] I will ask Wasai,
 she will serve the breakfast.
[120.76] Oh so you are back?
[124.52] How dare you step out of this 
house without my permission?
[133.96] What happened mom?
[135.76] Asked your beloved Urooj.
[141.64] Urooj?
[146.16] Aunt will tell you.
[151.24] Will someone tell me what 
is going on in this house?
[154.08] I asked her not to go 
to her father’s house,
[157.00] she still went without
 my permission.
[161.92] Mom, her father wasn’t well
[164.84] and I even know about it.
[166.52] But I asked her not to go,
[168.36] there is no importance of what I say?
[170.12] What you say is important
[172.48] but look, Urooj’s father wasn’t well,
[174.60] try to understand the situation.
[177.16] And I even stopped you from
 going to your in laws house?
[179.88] You didn’t obey my orders too,
[181.84] like his father was dying?
[185.08] Now you are being very wrong,
[188.24] do you even realize 
what you are saying?
[191.40] What did I say wrong?
[193.72] You are insulting my parents.
[198.16] Do you see this Salman?
[200.24] Do you see the way 
she is talking to me?
[202.92] Urooj, please at least you keep quiet.
[204.64] I won’t keep quiet. ,
[206.36] What does she think of herself?
[207.88] There is a limit of tolerating things.
[210.24] She says anything 
she feels like to me.
[212.64] What does she think of herself?
[215.16] Shut up!
[233.48] Mom? Mom?
[237.00] Get up.
[237.92] Aunt?
[238.56] Stay away.
[239.84] Mom?
[241.24] Driver take out the car.
[244.12] Mom, please get up.
[245.64] Driver. Driver. Mom?
[295.44] And I even stopped you from
 going to your in laws house?
[298.00] You didn’t obey my orders too,
[300.00] like his father was dying?
[303.12] I won’t keep quiet.
[304.88] What does she think of herself?
[306.88] Shut up!
[327.12] How dare you step out of this 
house without my permission?
[331.84] What happened mom?
[333.72] Asked your beloved Urooj.
[338.28] Urooj?
[340.00] Aunt will tell you.
[342.16] Will someone tell me what
is going on in this house?
[345.00] I asked her not to go to 
her father’s house,
[347.88] she still went without my permission.
[392.12] Salman, pick up the phone please.
[411.16] Why are you calling me 
again and again,
[416.04] you di what you had to?
[417.72] Salman?
[418.84] How is aunt? Is she well?
[422.60] What do you care about her?
[424.44] What are you saying Salman?
[428.56] Aunt got unwell
[430.60] and you are asking me to sit quietly?
[432.40] How is that possible?
[434.28] Look,
[436.12] whatever has happened,
 it is because of you
[440.72] that is why it will be better 
for you to stop calling.
[443.44] Salman, at least listen to me.
[489.04] Doctor?
[490.24] Yes?
[491.56] How is mom now?
[493.16] Look, your mom is quite better now
[495.76] but she has taken 
a lot of serious stress
[499.04] about something that could have
 been very dangerous for her.
[502.36] Anyways,
[503.52] now she is stable,
[504.92] we have given her tranquilizers
[507.24] and hopefully you can 
meet her in a while.
[513.96] Excuse me.
[514.68] Thank you doctor.
[538.28] Okay, at least come
 sit here with me.
[540.92] Come, good girl.
[554.16] Look you don’t have to worry.
[559.84] How should I not worry, aunt?
[564.92] Aunt got unwell because of me.
[568.12] It is not the first time it
 has happened, my child,
[570.52] it happens everytime.
[575.52] Just know that
[576.88] Mehreen is habitual of 
making Salman worried.
[580.40] Why would any mother
 do that to her son?
[583.36] My child, you don’t know her,
[585.56] ask me,
[589.24] I have spent half of my life with her.
[596.12] She always needs 
someone to cause pain.
[603.48] Earlier it was me
[605.96] and now it is you.
[608.00] No, no,
[609.80] she did nothing like that to me.
[615.04] And even if she does anything,
[617.20] I will happily accept it.
[621.52] Do you know,
[622.48] I am sad about Salman’s behavior,
[626.52] I never even thought that 
he could do this to me.
[631.00] What did Salman say?
[634.72] He…
[652.20] I don’t know I guess it was my fault.
[661.24] I don’t feel at peace aunt,
[663.04] I want to go to the hospital,
[664.36] I want to go see aunt.
[665.88] My child, if you go there,
[667.48] she will get mad at you.
[668.72] I don’t care about that right now.
[670.92] I called Salman,
[672.08] he is not telling me how is aunt,
[674.24] if she is well, I want to know.
[677.68] I am going.
[702.16] Madam,
[703.88] shall I get tea for you.
[706.08] yes.
[707.40] Okay.
[712.16] Greetings, Idrees,
[714.12] yes? how is Mehreen?
[721.36] Really?
[771.52] Why have you come here?
[773.12] What do you want?
[775.04] Are you in your senses?
[777.36] Aunt is not well
[778.88] and you are telling me to sit home?
[780.64] So you should have stayed home,
[784.28] look if you would have 
been needed here,
[786.00] I would have bring you here,
[788.00] but you know what?
[789.68] You don’t deserve it.
[793.48] You are escalating it now.
[794.64] So, I will.
[797.28] In fact I will take it to the end.
[801.16] You have started it, I will end it.
[806.92] I don’t want to argue
 with you right now.
[810.04] And everyone’s parents are
 dear to them like you do.
[812.88] So you should have 
stayed with them,
[814.96] what are you doing here?
[820.36] Do you know what 
did the doctors say?
[823.96] Mom took so much
 stress that she fainted,
[827.92] anything could have happened.
[830.60] And this is all because of you.
[837.20] Look, I am warning you
 to leave from here.
[843.60] Say whatever you want to
[846.60] but I won’t go from here till aunt
 get back in to her conscious.
[883.76] Thank god, 
she is conscious now,
[886.56] else I was thinking 
I will have to go to the hospital.
[890.08] Anyway, she will come 
back by evening now,
[893.56] okay you take care fo yourself.
[895.00] I will talk to you later. Bye.
[897.08] Madam?
[898.92] Is Madam Sr well now?
[902.60] As usual, it will be fine.
[905.24] Attention seeker.
[907.16] Do you even know 
what happened?
[910.24] Madam Sr insulted 
Madam Jr a lot,
[917.36] she said so many wrong 
things about her family,
[920.72] oh God! Oh God!
[924.32] It’s nothing new,
[926.52] Mehreen just needs 
something to talk.
[929.92] Listen to me,
[932.80] Sir slapped madam jr on her face.
[949.32] Wasai, you must mind 
your own business,
[953.20] there is no need to give
 information here and there.
[956.80] Go away and do you work.
[959.36] Okay madam.
[961.12] Close the door.
[962.44] Okay, okay.
[973.08] Salman raised his hands on Urooj?
[985.32] No, no, dad,
[987.20] you don’t have to come now,
[989.88] aunt is better now.
[992.60] And the doctors are saying
[994.48] they will discharge aunt in a while so
[997.04] we will then go home.
[1000.28] Okay fine. Bye.
[1014.76] You didn’t leave yet?
[1021.16] I told you I won’t leave.
[1026.60] Whose call was it?
[1030.12] It was dad’s call,
[1031.68] he was asking to visit.
[1033.48] Tell him not to come,
[1039.28] he doesn’t need to come here.
[1045.08] Whatever has happened,
[1046.04] it is because of him,
[1048.20] now what does he want to
 prove by coming here?
[1052.64] Slaman, he doesn’t even 
know what happened to aunt,
[1058.36] he was just asking how she was.
[1060.28] So then tell him
[1062.28] that it is because of him that 
mom is in the hospital today.
[1069.44] He will come here to ask.
[1074.68] Isn’t it enough that I have asked 
him not to come to the hospital?
[1150.80] why did you hang up the call?
[1153.20] I wanted to talk to Urooj as well.
[1156.64] Urooj quickly cut the call herself.
[1160.52] Hey, she is in the hospital
[1163.08] so it must be difficult to talk.
[1168.16] You are being worried 
for no reason.
[1171.72] I didn’t know that after getting 
the daughter married,
[1176.12] it will be so difficult for 
me to even talk to her.
[1182.16] Does in law’s house a place
[1186.24] where it gets difficult for 
 a daughter to meet her parents.
[1195.16] Master,
[1196.36] why are you making me worried,
[1198.40] tell me clearly what did Urooj say?
[1201.48] You know our brought,
[1205.52] Urooj will keep on 
tolerating everything
[1208.04] but she will never tell anything.
[1213.52] Okay so master,
[1215.88] let’s do one thing, let’s go visit,
[1217.96] hat is not Mehreen’s house,
[1219.96] that is a hospital,
[1221.28] and nothing should 
happen if we go there.
[1223.24] Wait.
[1225.84] We are not going anywhere.
[1227.32] After all why?
[1230.84] It is definitely a different place
[1233.52] but the people there are same.
[1237.28] Urooj’s mother in law will be there,
[1240.36] I am afraid that we might go 
out of love for our daughter
[1245.76] but our love might cost 
a lot to our daughter.
[1252.32] I wish,
[1256.36] I wish these mother in laws
[1259.44] can consider the daughter in laws
[1262.36] like their own daughters,
[1266.28] they should let the breath,
[1269.48] and if the daughter in 
law is like Urooj,
[1274.32] so respectful
[1277.48] and the one who 
talks with so much love.
[1282.76] All the sorrows are with this “I wish”
[1288.88] Oh I forgot that
[1293.52] how will Mehreen consider
 Urooj her own daughter,
[1298.20] she doesn’t have 
a daughter herself.
[1301.80] You are right,
[1309.44] we will call Urooj in a while again.
[1315.48] I am so worried.
[1338.88] What is this life?
[1346.92] Just a temporary betrayal?
[1357.36] And whatever aunt 
Mehreen is doing to me,
[1362.72] I will never tell that to 
my innocent parents
[1371.96] and make them worried.
[1379.32] Difficulties are not getting 
easy at all in my life.
[1387.16] Oh God!
[1390.52] Oh God! Give me 
courage and strength.
[1440.00] Do you even know
 what happened?
[1443.00] Madam Sr insulted Madam Jr a lot,
[1450.84] Sir slapped madam jr on her face.
[1480.56] Good evening.
[1482.04] Good evening.
[1484.52] What happened at home today?
[1487.12] The same that always happens.
[1492.72] Shaista, did you say 
something again?
[1497.72] I didn’t say anything Idrees,
[1501.68] nothing actually happened
 between I and Mehreen this time.
[1507.32] Now that won’t even happen,
[1510.88] because Mehreen got Urooj now.
[1514.80] Now she is making poor girl’s life hell.
[1527.44] Now will you even tell 
me what happened?
[1532.08] Whatever happened 
with Urooj’s parents,
[1537.64] I am sure that must 
have been the topic,
[1540.16] and then Urooj should have
 even spoken about it.
[1543.76] Are you encouraging Urooj?
[1548.32] I am not fond of making
 my son’s life hell.
[1554.16] Do you know
[1555.84] that mentally unstable woman 
has started affecting my son too.
[1562.80] Salman is very intelligent.
[1565.16] That is what I am telling you,
[1567.48] now Salman is being influenced,
[1569.92] that is why he slapped Urooj.
[1573.80] What?
[1575.40] What has Salman done?
[1577.32] Yes, that is what he did.
[1582.72] What happened that 
he raised his hand?
[1586.80] Drama,
[1590.28] Mehreen made her health so bad
[1593.80] that Salman panicked
[1597.24] and he couldn’t think of anything and
[1599.32] slapped Urooj.
[1604.60] My son is going through hell.
[1615.44] Everything will be fine.
[1618.36] Like it will!
[1622.32] I am telling you
[1623.84] I will explode one day.
[1629.20] I am losing patience now.
[1633.12] So then go and tell him.
[1637.80] Just imagine
[1639.16] when Salman finds out
[1640.72] you are his actual mother he 
will hate you so much
[1647.04] that you had given him in Mehreen’s 
lap when he was a child
[1650.24] just because of money.
[1655.12] Not because of money,
[1657.64] for Mehreen’s life.
[1666.92] Fool everyone
[1669.40] but not me and yourself, Shaista.
[1771.16] Salman?
[1777.68] Son?
[1785.08] Water.
[1789.04] Water.
[1793.92] Aunt.
[1795.28] Water.
[1796.08] Have water, take it.
[1801.64] Give it to me.
[1802.88] Move to the side.
[1805.92] Mom? Mom?
[1809.08] get up and have water.
[1810.16] Get up, get up. Careful.
[1873.56] Is everything okay?
[1877.88] I don’t know Master,
[1881.52] what is it?
[1889.40] Look when we are sad,
[1893.20] I am sure we are diverting 
our mind from somewhere,
[1899.04] what are the thoughts 
that you are fighting?
[1903.76] I am very worried
 because of Urooj.
[1911.48] That means, what 
I was thinking yesterday,
[1913.84] you are thinking that today?
[1916.88] But you were right,
[1919.20] that is how mother in laws are,
[1922.68] I was overthinking.
[1927.08] I didn’t see happiness
 on Urooj’s face,
[1934.56] I am sure there is 
definitely something
[1939.20] that she is hiding from us.
[1943.28] Look Naseema Begum,
[1944.60] we can only pray now,
[1948.92] we have never slacked in Urooj’s
 brought in any aspect ever
[1953.56] and I am sure that
[1955.32] Urooj as the capability of
 tackling every difficulty.
[1962.96] You are comforting me today?
[1965.92] like you were comforting 
me yesterday.
[1995.88] Look Naseema Begum,
[1999.92] we had nothing in our life,
[2005.16] then we got Urooj
[2007.76] and the happiness of 
our lives got the peak,
[2012.20] now that she is not here,
[2014.96] we panic when we 
don’t find her here at home.
[2022.92] Okay,
[2025.08] call Urooj.
[2030.08] Okay I will.
[2052.64] Hello?
[2055.20] Greetings dad.
[2056.68] Greetings, my child, how are you?
[2059.84] I am absolutely fine, how are you?
[2062.80] We are absolutely fine too.
[2064.56] First tell me how is your aunt now?
[2067.76] She is better now by the grace of God.
[2070.24] We are just going home in a while.
[2072.76] Okay,
[2074.08] my child, if you are 
not getting disturbed,
[2076.80] can we talk for a while?
[2079.96] What are you saying dad?
[2081.80] Tell me what is it?
[2084.88] yes, my child,
[2086.28] we were missing you a lot,
[2088.92] here, talk to your mom.
[2090.76] Listen dad,
[2092.24] turn on the speaker,
[2093.52] I will talk to you both.
[2095.52] Yes, my child, 
I never thought of that.
[2100.52] So my lovely mom is missing me?
[2103.92] Do you miss me?
[2106.00] because I have spoken to dad.
[2109.40] no urooj my child,
[2111.32] both of us were missing you a lot.
[2114.48] How are you?
[2118.36] I Am absolutely fine mom.
[2121.28] Okay, tell me
[2123.32] how is your mother in law?
[2125.52] She is better now.
[2127.76] Dad, can you hear me?
[2130.36] yes, my child, I can.
[2133.00] Take out the motor bike,
[2134.16] make mom sit on it and 
take her to the food street
[2136.64] and buy her, 
her favorite ice cream.
[2142.80] Both of you won’t be sad then.
[2144.96] And yes, listen
[2146.00] do WhatsApp me the picture
[2147.40] as well of both of you having 
an ice cream together.
[2151.68] Your wish is my command,
 daughter. Okay?
[2155.24] Take care. Bye.
[2157.32] Yes, bye.
[2158.64] Bye, my child.
[2162.32] Let’s go wife,
[2163.68] we have to listen to 
daughter’s orders.
[2165.76] Let’s go.
[2192.72] now she is better
[2194.28] but Mr Salman, in this 
age that your mother is in,
[2197.92] mental stress increases,
[2199.68] the medicines that she is 
taking right now, she must continue it,
[2202.76] I have added one medicine
 to the prescription.
[2205.24] And yes,
[2206.20] you have to make sure
[2208.24] you have to provide her with the
 most stress-free environment,
[2211.40] depression, anxiety shouldn’t 
even come close to her,
[2214.68] I hope you understand? Great.
[2217.24] Thank you.
[2218.00] Excuse me.
[2234.44] Salman brought you here?
[2236.60] Aunt, Salman didn’t bring me here,
[2238.40] I came her myself.
[2239.96] That’s it,
[2241.08] are you done arguing with me?
[2243.44] Or you want to do it more 
that you have come here?
[2246.60] You are Salman’s mom, so
[2248.84] you are my mom too, right?
[2250.12] Don’t you dare,
[2251.44] don’t you dare call me your mom,
[2253.16] I am just Slaman’s mother,
[2254.48] never say that again.
