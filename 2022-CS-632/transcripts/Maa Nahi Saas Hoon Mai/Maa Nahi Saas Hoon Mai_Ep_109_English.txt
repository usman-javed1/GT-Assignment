How will we manage these matters
 of the court? Have you thought about it? What do you mean how will 
they be managed? They say that if you want to go the hospital 
and court, then you should not carry money
in your pocket, you should take bags full of it. Now where will we got so much 
money from, Master? God will make a way. God makes all the way. Now, you don’t earn 
that much pension, now we have more people 
at home as well. There has been an addition 
of three people. Why three? Areej is really young right now. Areej’s expense is the most. Her milk is really costly. A box of five thousand runs out 
in five days. I am bored staying at home. Mr. Sadiq has told me repeatedly
 to join his school, I think I will join him. Your health isn’t stable. Will you do a job in this age? What happened to my health? I am fit. What can be done staying at home? You have tea. Areej’s expense is the most. Her milk is really costly. A box of five thousand runs out 
in five days. I am bored staying at home. Mr. Sadiq has told me repeatedly 
to join his school, I think I will join him. Your health isn’t stable. Will you do a job in this age? What happened to my health? I am fit. What can be done staying at home? Papa, you know when I was taking care of 
Salman’s office, I got to learn a lot there. You child, that is true. A person learns a lot by working. Yes, if they sit at home, then the education they got 
goes to waste. That is also true. I was thinking that why don’t I do a job? It is a weird coincidence, child. I am also thinking of doing a job, and you too are thinking of 
doing a job. But this cannot happen. You will not do a job. Why won’t I? Because I will do the job. I will do it. Okay, let’s do one thing, 
we will have a toss. Whoever wins will do a job. No. We are not having a toss. And it is decided that I will do a job, and swear to me you will 
not say anything. Okay fine. Now you made me swear on you, 
so what else can I say? But what will happen to Areej? Areej? Nothing will happen to her. She has two grandmothers 
they will take care of her. Fine. Okay fine. Two grandmothers. That’s it, then it is decided. Okay fine. Papa you just have your tea, 
then we will go. Okay. Arooj, child, have breakfast. You will not leave without having tea. No mama, I am not hungry at all. Okay, I will have tea. You have always skipped breakfast. Since the time you were young and 
used to go to school. Naseema, would quietly put your 
lunch box in your bag. Yes, and when I would come home, mama would see the lunch box and
 I wouldn’t have touched it. Then Naseema would get upset and you would quickly finish your 
lunch and show her. Then mama and I would become 
friends again. Yes. Come on, child, 
you will get late. You should reach thirty minutes 
before time on the interview day. Hey, hey, wait. What is wrong? Have a piece of sandwich Arooj. Oh ho, here, I have taken it. 
Happy now? Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Yes, child, how was your interview? It was fine, papa. What do you think? Will they give you a job? Your daughter is really capable. They are asking me to join 
from tomorrow. So are you joining from tomorrow? No, they are offering a really 
low salary package. Okay fine, you will find a good job somewhere. Shall we go now? 
This is enough for today. Okay?
Fine. I will take care of everything, 
I will do it myself, this is what you had said, right? Then what happened? What happened? 
Nothing happened. And whatever happened was wrong. You will not be able to do anything 
and we will get exposed. We will get punished for the thing 
that we didn’t do If you speak so loudly,
I won’t understand anything. You had sent those shooters, right? Yes, so? What happened? They were really cheap shooters. They shot at someone and 
someone else got shot. But, how did you get this news? Nasir went to the hospital 
to meet someone. He told me that he met Arooj. Master Shoaib got shot. Where? Where did he get shot? I don’t know where he got shot, but Arooj didn’t even get a scratch. Now you must be calling 
those shooters, right? Very good. Very nice. Those shooters will get caught, the police will get your call record and then the police will come catch you.
Is this what you want? Do you still think you will 
take care of this matter? You won’t be able to do anything,
and that Arooj will dance on our heads. How is this possible? She has good fate; Arooj won’t be 
saved every time. Will someone tell me, what is going on? What are you two doing? Tell me as well, 
I too should find out. You too hear it out, and show us the amazing 
feat you can achieve. What tone are you talking to me in? Mom, dad’s plan failed. Arooj survived. I don’t know when this Arooj 
will have her downfall. Once she leaves, 
our life will be at peace. I don’t know what will happen. I am the owner of this business, 
property, wealth and I have learned this well. So, my advice to you is to stop 
dreaming about this. It is just a matter of me
going to court, the game you planned for 
twenty five years will be destroyed in minutes. So, the meaning of all this is that stay away from my husband,
my daughter and my mother’s life. This has your betterment in it. We kept on being worried here, why did you people not 
tell us anything? Had I told you two as well, then you two would have 
gotten worried too. Thank God, He blessed us. Master, God gave you a second life. This is because of the prayers 
of you people, or else the one who tried to kill me, 
tried his best. And he had bled a lot too, mama. Thank God, brother Nasir’s friends made 
immediate arrangement. So, if the position was such, then why did you people
 come home? Papa was in a hurry to come home. The doctor told him to stay admitted
in the hospital. I would have gotten admitted 
in the hospital, Naseema, but do you have any idea how much 
it would have cost? I will get the dressing done at home 
for two to four days, I will be fine. Okay, tell me, did the doctor tell you to follow some 
diet because of the wound. Hey, nothing special. 
Nothing. Then I will go make soup for you. Hey, leave… Hey, what are you doing?
Master. Don’t move your hand, 
your wound is still fresh. You lie down comfortably, 
I will bring it for you. Papa, you won’t move now. All of you got a chance 
to order me around. I won’t move. And I had an idea,
he would go there, so I went there following him. What is wrong with you? Why did you go there? What did Salman do? He did what he had done earlier too. In fact, maybe this time he did something 
even more dangerous. Oh God, be kind. What did Salman do? He hit papa’s motorcycle with his car. Thank God, there was no big accident. hey, he didn’t hit on purpose. It was just a coincidence. Papa, why don’t you say that he tried to kill you? I have taken out all the information. Nothing happened to Master Shoaib. He has even gone home. Master Shoaib, wasn’t even our target. What are you saying? 
Huh? Master Shoaib is Arooj’s biggest strength. She does everything with his advice. This entire family has become
 a problem for us. If we would have gotten rid of 
Master Shoaib, Arooj would have become weak. Master will get scared now. How will he get scared? Shaista is right, we will have to think ten times 
before making any plan, anything can happen. You know, you people surprise me. I mean, you people made such a 
big plan to just scare master Shoaib. This is the limit. Don’t worry, it won’t happen this time. Yes. I don’t think so. Anyway, we will have to face the consequences 
of what we have done. Salman. Son, what happened?
How did this happen? Son, Salman, is everything okay?
Are you fine? Yes, uncle, I am fine. Actually, two people came on a bike
and they shot me. Thank God, I am fine now. Did you file a report with the police? Yes, mom. You did the right thing. 
You did the right thing. Okay, don’t worry, I am fine. 
Nothing happened. Idrees, get a black goat quickly and 
do charity for my Salman. Yes. Yes. Wasai, bring turmeric milk.
Go quickly. Yes. Come on. 
Come inside. Yes, son. 
Careful. Does it hurt a lot? Do you have pain?
Huh? Don’t worry, I am fine. I don’t have proof for this, that uncle Idrees got this attack done. But I have no reason to reject this, that all this was not done by uncle. Arooj. What are you thinking? I am thinking that papa knows everything 
about this attack. But I don’t know why, he doesn’t want to say anything 
about this. Yes, Arooj. Master didn’t say a word a single 
moment of this incident. and maybe he doesn’t want to 
talk about this because he feels that his daughter Arooj 
will start disliking his in-laws.
