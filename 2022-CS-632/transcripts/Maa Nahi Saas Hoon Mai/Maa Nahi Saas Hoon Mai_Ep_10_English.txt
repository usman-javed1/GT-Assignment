Dad, it was good that you were 
lying there in the room, what was the need to come here? My child, I start feeling very 
heavy if I keep on lying Sirt carefully. Dad, are you okay? Yes, I am fine. How do you feel now? I feel better now. If you may allow, shall I take an appointment 
from another doctor? Let’s get you checked
 up once more? No my child, that is not needed, I am fine, its just a little weakness, it will go away with time. She is a daughter so she 
panics very quickly, she takes a little illness 
of her father like it’s very huge. That is how the hearts 
of daughters are. True. Urooj? Yes? Shall we leave? Umm… How can you just leave, son? Why so soon? Just sit for a while, at least. Urooj, go see what your mother is doing, tell her to make tea. Okay, I will do that. Go, go. So, son, you tell? I have gotten very late for office, just get the breakfast ready quickly. I will ask Wasai,
 she will serve the breakfast. Oh so you are back? How dare you step out of this 
house without my permission? What happened mom? Asked your beloved Urooj. Urooj? Aunt will tell you. Will someone tell me what 
is going on in this house? I asked her not to go 
to her father’s house, she still went without
 my permission. Mom, her father wasn’t well and I even know about it. But I asked her not to go, there is no importance of what I say? What you say is important but look, Urooj’s father wasn’t well, try to understand the situation. And I even stopped you from
 going to your in laws house? You didn’t obey my orders too, like his father was dying? Now you are being very wrong, do you even realize 
what you are saying? What did I say wrong? You are insulting my parents. Do you see this Salman? Do you see the way 
she is talking to me? Urooj, please at least you keep quiet. I won’t keep quiet. , What does she think of herself? There is a limit of tolerating things. She says anything 
she feels like to me. What does she think of herself? Shut up! Mom? Mom? Get up. Aunt? Stay away. Mom? Driver take out the car. Mom, please get up. Driver. Driver. Mom? And I even stopped you from
 going to your in laws house? You didn’t obey my orders too, like his father was dying? I won’t keep quiet. What does she think of herself? Shut up! How dare you step out of this 
house without my permission? What happened mom? Asked your beloved Urooj. Urooj? Aunt will tell you. Will someone tell me what
is going on in this house? I asked her not to go to 
her father’s house, she still went without my permission. Salman, pick up the phone please. Why are you calling me 
again and again, you di what you had to? Salman? How is aunt? Is she well? What do you care about her? What are you saying Salman? Aunt got unwell and you are asking me to sit quietly? How is that possible? Look, whatever has happened,
 it is because of you that is why it will be better 
for you to stop calling. Salman, at least listen to me. Doctor? Yes? How is mom now? Look, your mom is quite better now but she has taken 
a lot of serious stress about something that could have
 been very dangerous for her. Anyways, now she is stable, we have given her tranquilizers and hopefully you can 
meet her in a while. Excuse me. Thank you doctor. Okay, at least come
 sit here with me. Come, good girl. Look you don’t have to worry. How should I not worry, aunt? Aunt got unwell because of me. It is not the first time it
 has happened, my child, it happens everytime. Just know that Mehreen is habitual of 
making Salman worried. Why would any mother
 do that to her son? My child, you don’t know her, ask me, I have spent half of my life with her. She always needs 
someone to cause pain. Earlier it was me and now it is you. No, no, she did nothing like that to me. And even if she does anything, I will happily accept it. Do you know, I am sad about Salman’s behavior, I never even thought that 
he could do this to me. What did Salman say? He… I don’t know I guess it was my fault. I don’t feel at peace aunt, I want to go to the hospital, I want to go see aunt. My child, if you go there, she will get mad at you. I don’t care about that right now. I called Salman, he is not telling me how is aunt, if she is well, I want to know. I am going. Madam, shall I get tea for you. yes. Okay. Greetings, Idrees, yes? how is Mehreen? Really? Why have you come here? What do you want? Are you in your senses? Aunt is not well and you are telling me to sit home? So you should have stayed home, look if you would have 
been needed here, I would have bring you here, but you know what? You don’t deserve it. You are escalating it now. So, I will. In fact I will take it to the end. You have started it, I will end it. I don’t want to argue
 with you right now. And everyone’s parents are
 dear to them like you do. So you should have 
stayed with them, what are you doing here? Do you know what 
did the doctors say? Mom took so much
 stress that she fainted, anything could have happened. And this is all because of you. Look, I am warning you
 to leave from here. Say whatever you want to but I won’t go from here till aunt
 get back in to her conscious. Thank god, 
she is conscious now, else I was thinking 
I will have to go to the hospital. Anyway, she will come 
back by evening now, okay you take care fo yourself. I will talk to you later. Bye. Madam? Is Madam Sr well now? As usual, it will be fine. Attention seeker. Do you even know 
what happened? Madam Sr insulted 
Madam Jr a lot, she said so many wrong 
things about her family, oh God! Oh God! It’s nothing new, Mehreen just needs 
something to talk. Listen to me, Sir slapped madam jr on her face. Wasai, you must mind 
your own business, there is no need to give
 information here and there. Go away and do you work. Okay madam. Close the door. Okay, okay. Salman raised his hands on Urooj? No, no, dad, you don’t have to come now, aunt is better now. And the doctors are saying they will discharge aunt in a while so we will then go home. Okay fine. Bye. You didn’t leave yet? I told you I won’t leave. Whose call was it? It was dad’s call, he was asking to visit. Tell him not to come, he doesn’t need to come here. Whatever has happened, it is because of him, now what does he want to
 prove by coming here? Slaman, he doesn’t even 
know what happened to aunt, he was just asking how she was. So then tell him that it is because of him that 
mom is in the hospital today. He will come here to ask. Isn’t it enough that I have asked 
him not to come to the hospital? why did you hang up the call? I wanted to talk to Urooj as well. Urooj quickly cut the call herself. Hey, she is in the hospital so it must be difficult to talk. You are being worried 
for no reason. I didn’t know that after getting 
the daughter married, it will be so difficult for 
me to even talk to her. Does in law’s house a place where it gets difficult for 
 a daughter to meet her parents. Master, why are you making me worried, tell me clearly what did Urooj say? You know our brought, Urooj will keep on 
tolerating everything but she will never tell anything. Okay so master, let’s do one thing, let’s go visit, hat is not Mehreen’s house, that is a hospital, and nothing should 
happen if we go there. Wait. We are not going anywhere. After all why? It is definitely a different place but the people there are same. Urooj’s mother in law will be there, I am afraid that we might go 
out of love for our daughter but our love might cost 
a lot to our daughter. I wish, I wish these mother in laws can consider the daughter in laws like their own daughters, they should let the breath, and if the daughter in 
law is like Urooj, so respectful and the one who 
talks with so much love. All the sorrows are with this “I wish” Oh I forgot that how will Mehreen consider
 Urooj her own daughter, she doesn’t have 
a daughter herself. You are right, we will call Urooj in a while again. I am so worried. What is this life? Just a temporary betrayal? And whatever aunt 
Mehreen is doing to me, I will never tell that to 
my innocent parents and make them worried. Difficulties are not getting 
easy at all in my life. Oh God! Oh God! Give me 
courage and strength. Do you even know
 what happened? Madam Sr insulted Madam Jr a lot, Sir slapped madam jr on her face. Good evening. Good evening. What happened at home today? The same that always happens. Shaista, did you say 
something again? I didn’t say anything Idrees, nothing actually happened
 between I and Mehreen this time. Now that won’t even happen, because Mehreen got Urooj now. Now she is making poor girl’s life hell. Now will you even tell 
me what happened? Whatever happened 
with Urooj’s parents, I am sure that must 
have been the topic, and then Urooj should have
 even spoken about it. Are you encouraging Urooj? I am not fond of making
 my son’s life hell. Do you know that mentally unstable woman 
has started affecting my son too. Salman is very intelligent. That is what I am telling you, now Salman is being influenced, that is why he slapped Urooj. What? What has Salman done? Yes, that is what he did. What happened that 
he raised his hand? Drama, Mehreen made her health so bad that Salman panicked and he couldn’t think of anything and slapped Urooj. My son is going through hell. Everything will be fine. Like it will! I am telling you I will explode one day. I am losing patience now. So then go and tell him. Just imagine when Salman finds out you are his actual mother he 
will hate you so much that you had given him in Mehreen’s 
lap when he was a child just because of money. Not because of money, for Mehreen’s life. Fool everyone but not me and yourself, Shaista. Salman? Son? Water. Water. Aunt. Water. Have water, take it. Give it to me. Move to the side. Mom? Mom? get up and have water. Get up, get up. Careful. Is everything okay? I don’t know Master, what is it? Look when we are sad, I am sure we are diverting 
our mind from somewhere, what are the thoughts 
that you are fighting? I am very worried
 because of Urooj. That means, what 
I was thinking yesterday, you are thinking that today? But you were right, that is how mother in laws are, I was overthinking. I didn’t see happiness
 on Urooj’s face, I am sure there is 
definitely something that she is hiding from us. Look Naseema Begum, we can only pray now, we have never slacked in Urooj’s
 brought in any aspect ever and I am sure that Urooj as the capability of
 tackling every difficulty. You are comforting me today? like you were comforting 
me yesterday. Look Naseema Begum, we had nothing in our life, then we got Urooj and the happiness of 
our lives got the peak, now that she is not here, we panic when we 
don’t find her here at home. Okay, call Urooj. Okay I will. Hello? Greetings dad. Greetings, my child, how are you? I am absolutely fine, how are you? We are absolutely fine too. First tell me how is your aunt now? She is better now by the grace of God. We are just going home in a while. Okay, my child, if you are 
not getting disturbed, can we talk for a while? What are you saying dad? Tell me what is it? yes, my child, we were missing you a lot, here, talk to your mom. Listen dad, turn on the speaker, I will talk to you both. Yes, my child, 
I never thought of that. So my lovely mom is missing me? Do you miss me? because I have spoken to dad. no urooj my child, both of us were missing you a lot. How are you? I Am absolutely fine mom. Okay, tell me how is your mother in law? She is better now. Dad, can you hear me? yes, my child, I can. Take out the motor bike, make mom sit on it and 
take her to the food street and buy her, 
her favorite ice cream. Both of you won’t be sad then. And yes, listen do WhatsApp me the picture as well of both of you having 
an ice cream together. Your wish is my command,
 daughter. Okay? Take care. Bye. Yes, bye. Bye, my child. Let’s go wife, we have to listen to 
daughter’s orders. Let’s go. now she is better but Mr Salman, in this 
age that your mother is in, mental stress increases, the medicines that she is 
taking right now, she must continue it, I have added one medicine
 to the prescription. And yes, you have to make sure you have to provide her with the
 most stress-free environment, depression, anxiety shouldn’t 
even come close to her, I hope you understand? Great. Thank you. Excuse me. Salman brought you here? Aunt, Salman didn’t bring me here, I came her myself. That’s it, are you done arguing with me? Or you want to do it more 
that you have come here? You are Salman’s mom, so you are my mom too, right? Don’t you dare, don’t you dare call me your mom, I am just Slaman’s mother, never say that again.
