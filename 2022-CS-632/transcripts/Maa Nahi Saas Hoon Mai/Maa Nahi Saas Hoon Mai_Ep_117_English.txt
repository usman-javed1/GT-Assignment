Mom and dad, 
come let’s have breakfast. I don’t want to have breakfast. Make your dad have it. Nobody needs to worry 
about me at all. Hey, when the matter is over, 
why have sorrow on it? The matter is over? You fooled me for the past 
fourteen years. You deceived me. You will have to answer 
for that deceit. The matter is not over, 
it has begun. You are not ashamed of doing 
something like this. Shaista, if you continue to 
blow this out of proportions, I will leave the home and go. For God’s sake, please. Stop it you two. Don’t you know that we are already 
fighting a battle, and if you people do this, then we will become weak and 
our enemy will benefit. Now you people think about it. If you people want to fight like this,
then tell me. I will leave the home and go. Where is this girl? She still hasn’t come for breakfast. What is this, child, Arooj? You will have breakfast in a hurry? You should wake up a little early. Mama, Areej didn’t let me 
sleep all night, I couldn’t sleep properly. This is correct. You do one thing, child, 
make her sleep with me. Naseema, you are a deep sleeper, Areej will continue to cry and 
you wont even know. No child, don’t do that. Now, that is not true, master. Areej, if that is the matter then 
make Areej sleep with me. Okay anyway, I wanted to talk to you all about
something important. Especially to you, papa. Yes, yes, child, go ahead. I have spoken to the lawyer and I have also prepared 
all the documents. What are you going to do Arooj? You had told me that we shouldn’t 
take support from the law, or else everyone in the world will 
find out about this. Yes, child. But papa, things have now 
gotten out of hand. We will have to do legal proceedings 
to face these people. Arooj, what will you do now? I will not do it, mama, 
I have done it. I have filed a case on Salman, 
uncle Idrees and aunt Shaista. Anyway, I am getting late. I will come back and talk about 
the rest in the evening. Goodbye. Goodbye. Sister Mehreen, 
come on have breakfast. Sure. Master, have breakfast. Sir, the courier guy left this envelope. What is this? A notice from the court. Who sent it? Arooj has put a claim on the ownership
of the entire business and property. I knew it. I knew Arooj will do this one day. That is why we were being 
strict on her. That damned woman has good luck. We tried so much to get a grip 
on Arooj and her relatives. But, what happened? Nothing, and then on top of that
 we got this notice. Now will you say something or will us father and son worry 
to save this empire. You are worrying now. I kept this property, business and home
safe for the past twenty five years. And now we will lose it in minutes. Hey, how will we lose it like this? In court, arguments, evidence, 
and witnesses are required. Everything is against us. Nothing will go anywhere. I will hire the best of lawyers. The ruling will be in our favour. I have signed the file. You can also recheck with sir Nasir. Okay madam. Thank you. 
Okay madam, thank you. Hello. Hello. How are you Shanzay? All okay? You called so early in the morning. What is wrong? It is 10 am. Oh, I didn’t see the time. I called you to tell you that my case has been filed, and I have given the money 
I had with me to the lawyer. Yes, he is a principal oriented advocate. He messaged me immediately that 
your friend transferred the money. Yes, actually, I wanted to talk to you 
about something else. The lawyer is someone you know, in fact, he is your cousin, so I think that he will listen 
to you more. Yes, go ahead? Is it possible, Shanzay, that I pay him the fees in the end, 
once the case is over? Hey Arooj, there is nothing
 to worry in this. He is a really good man and I just pray that 
you win this case. Thank you so much. Okay. Take care of yourself. We will talk again. Goodbye. Goodbye. Arooj, you know, you have stood up against 
cruel people. We are not oppressed, mama. We can snatch our right, and because of cowardice, those people have become 
like Pharaoh today. Arooj, I have complete trust in your 
strong headedness. But brother Idrees and 
sister in law Shaista, can go to any extent. You didn’t take Salman’s name. Is it not amongst our opponents? He is. He is part of those people as well. But…
But, what? You don’t use words like if and 
but in between right and wrong, mama. Either a person is right or they are wrong, and Salman is constantly 
doing wrong. Anyway, I am doing all this to get the right 
of my mother and daughter. And no matter who comes 
in the way of it, I will not forgive them. Dad, come quickly, 
we are getting late. Salman. One second, wait son. Did you keep all the documents? Mom, what do we have apart from 
the caretaking documents. Anyway, I gave them to the lawyer. Yes, those won’t be enough. So he will get more made, 
what does he charge us money for? Okay, look, son Salman. You have to control your anger. You will not argue with Arooj 
and her mother, there. What if it creates a new issue. Mom, my anger is in control, or else I wanted… and I am angry, why such a 
big issue was created? If dad had gotten the documents 
made twenty two years back, then today, everything would 
have been in our control. Yes, so how was I to know that Arooj will come back and 
Mehreen will get fine too. Yes, son, Salman. 
Shall we go? You learn something from Salman. I don’t understand. That’s the issue. You don’t understand. I wish you too, thought like your son, Salman. I wish you wouldn’t have focused 
on luxury throughout your life. And we wouldn’t have had 
to visit the court. Good luck, son. Shall we go? Papa, I am going to court. You keep on lying down, rest. I wish child I was in the condition 
that I too could go with you. I am going to fight those people, who have put you in this condition. The same thing again. Arooj is right. Anyway, child, you go ahead and what did you do about 
the lawyer’s fee? I have some money with me, 
take it along. No, I don’t need it right now. I will ask you for it, when I need it. So, where did you get the money from? Brother Nasir gave me some money. I am very thankful to him, that 
he supported me in this time. and Salman? When did Salman do good with 
that good man? Okay child. Child, take a lot of care of you
and sister Mehreen. Take different routes 
when coming and going. When you have enemies,
you need to be careful. Papa, you too accepted it. Master knows everything,
he just doesn’t accept it. Goodbye. Goodbye. May God protect our Arooj. Amen. Greetings. 
Greetings. Come on, the court proceeding 
is starting. What are you thinking, Naseema. Master, I am really worried. What does our Arooj have to do
with the court. I don’t know what sort 
of people are there, and what topics will they discuss? “It’s a different world there, Naseema. Once you get there, the true meaning
of the word witness box becomes apparent. Why witness box are referred 
to as the witness box’ Lawyers use such questions, 
such tricky language, that a person is left perplexed. Really? So, this should be there for 
the accused, right? Hey, whether it is the accused 
or the defendant, it is difficult to keep your tone strong 
in front of those questions and arguments. God. God. God, give courage to our Arooj. Amen. Oh God, have mercy 
on my daughter. God, make all matters easy for her. Remove all her difficulties. Amen. Begin the proceedings of the case. Your Honor, my client Arooj Ahmad has filed 
a claim of ownership of her father. I request permission to summon 
Arooj Ahmad to the witness box. You have my permission. Mr. Judge, this is Arooj Ahmad, she has filed a claim on the ownership
 of her father’s wealth, which her father had put in her name
twenty two years back. Arooj, please apprise the court 
of your stance. Mr. Judge, as my lawyer has told you, my father had put all his property and 
wealth in my name at the time of my birth. But suddenly, he passed away 
in an accident. My father’s entire wealth and property 
has been taken over by his brother, that is my uncle. My mother was not in such 
a condition that she could take care of all this. That is why I request you to get me
my right back. Yes, the defendant’s lawyer would you like to inquire something
from Arooj Ahmad? No, Mr. Judge, right now I don’t want 
to ask her anything. You can leave. Thank you, your honour.
