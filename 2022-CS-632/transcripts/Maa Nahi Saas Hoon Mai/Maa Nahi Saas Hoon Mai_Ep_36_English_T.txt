[27.92] Yes?
[31.20] Elder madam, you called?
[35.08] Where do you go around 
all the time?
[37.44] I was calling you for so long,
[38.52] where were you?
[39.76] I was in the kitchen.
[42.52] Okay fine,
[43.96] send Mr. Salman to me,
[45.36] and tell him that I am calling him,
[46.88] he should come immediately.
[50.08] Little master is not in his room.
[54.76] Then where is he?
[56.16] He still hasn’t come 
back from the office.
[60.48] He still hasn’t come from office?
[62.84] Okay, fine, you send Arooj to me.
[67.08] Elder madam,
[69.12] younger madam is not
 in her room either
[72.68] If she is not in her room, then
[74.12] where did both of them go?
[76.20] And no one at home knows.
[80.80] God be kind,
[81.80] Salman comes back from
 the office by this time.
[86.40] Fine, you leave and
[87.68] give me my phone on your way.
[89.36] Sure.
[99.76] Here you go, madam.
[101.40] Thank you. Leave.
[111.64] God be kind.
[113.76] This boy’s phone is also off.
[130.16] The entire office is empty,
[134.44] what are you doing here, alone?
[141.56] What is the work that you still 
haven’t closed the office?
[146.64] You know aunt there is a lot 
of work in the office.
[149.72] I thought why don’t I finish 
tomorrow’s work today as well.
[157.76] Okay, come on,
 tell me the real thing
[160.08] because of which you have hid 
yourself behind this work?
[166.92] No, why would I do that?
[169.72] So that you don’t have 
to face Salman.
[176.36] What difference does
 it make to him whether
[178.08] I talk to him or I don’t.
[184.72] Arooj, I can understand,
[187.36] whatever Salman did was intolerable.
[194.12] If Idrees to had put a baseless
 allegation on me,
[198.04] then I would never have tolerated it,
[199.56] I would never have spoken to him.
[209.76] I am tolerating it.
[218.20] But tolerating it is not that easy,
[225.12] because a woman is weak.
[228.96] You are not weak,
[230.68] nor are you alone.
[232.48] I am with you.
[238.24] I will say one thing, child.
[243.12] You don’t run from problems,
[245.20] you face them.
[255.60] Okay?
[286.08] Salman,
[288.24] God forbid, did you see anything 
with your eyes?
[294.92] No.
[298.68] You doubt sister-in-law, Arooj?
[305.16] I never doubted her.
[311.16] She herself is giving me 
the chance to doubt her
[314.08] But Salman, there will be 
some basis for doubting her.
[320.12] You know,
[322.48] when everyone told me,
[324.52] I didn’t agree.
[327.84] But when I told Arooj
 myself to fire Ammad,
[331.40] she clearly said no to me.
[336.40] You tell me yourself,
[338.68] what does this mean?
[341.20] Look Salman,
[341.68] you can take out any 
meaning of this,
[343.12] it is up to you.
[347.04] But what you are thinking
[350.36] is not true at all.
[355.32] I will go mad.
[357.16] You are going mad right now,
[359.04] by thinking this baseless thing.
[364.76] I am badly stuck.
[367.36] Then remove this worry, buddy.
[369.72] Discuss it with sister-in-law, Arooj.
[374.52] Ask her why she doesn’t
 want to fire him.
[378.56] No.
[381.96] I won’t ask her.
[387.84] You are the CEO of the company,
[391.32] the entire staff works under you,
[394.80] and she is not your staff, 
she is your wife.
[398.32] Sit and talk to her.
[409.88] I don’t understand why 
you are upset.
[416.60] You didn’t try to clarify what 
you wanted to say.
[423.48] I tried to clarify what I wanted in 
front of Salman on day one, aunt.
[432.04] But I didn’t find Salman
[434.32] and when I found Salman,
[437.08] he has already made several 
decisions in his mind.
[440.32] No, no, you are 
thinking wrong.
[446.64] Salman does 
think emotionally,
[449.84] but he doesn’t decide.
[456.00] It is good that
[458.20] you want to clear 
what you mean.
[464.76] I don’t understand 
what Salman wants.
[470.24] He is really stubborn.
[472.92] I know that.
[478.44] Believe me,
[479.84] now he must be sorry 
for what he did.
[487.24] How can you say that?
[490.00] That is why he is not coming 
in front of you.
[496.28] He is hiding his face and 
going around.
[499.92] That is not true.
[506.12] I know Salman really well.
[514.60] He will never be sorry
 for what he did.
[518.88] Why are you so misled 
towards Salman?
[525.44] When Salman can
 be misled about me,
[529.92] then me being misled is allowed.
[534.36] Look child,
[536.56] if any misunderstanding happens 
between husband and wife,
[543.08] then one of the two should move
 forward and clear the thing
[553.40] or else things get out 
of hand further,
[560.48] and then, this way,
[562.40] these baseless allegations
[565.20] also seem like the truth.
[633.28] Hello.
[635.80] Yes, Mr. Ahmad,
 are you in the office?
[640.84] Do one thing,
[642.84] book a ticket for me for tonight,
[644.80] I have to go to Islamabad.
[647.44] And yes,
[649.24] I will stay in Islamabad 
for four days,
[650.84] so also book a hotel.
[653.16] Thank you.
[658.88] Why are you going 
to Islamabad?
[662.72] I don’t want to go home.
[665.08] This means you are escaping.
[670.88] Salman, you do this
[672.72] when you have done
 something wrong.
[673.96] I have not done anything wrong.
[677.80] I have done nothing wrong.
[680.00] You are making something small, 
into a big issue.
[684.60] You know what the truth is,
 Salman?
[686.48] You don’t want to hear the truth.
[690.20] This is your biggest issue.
[691.72] Yes, I don’t want to hear it.
[695.40] Because this truth is 
unacceptable for me.
[698.16] This is actually my point.
[700.68] The truth.
[702.48] Meaning, you are believing 
something you have never seen.
[707.52] Man, I don’t understand
[709.88] why would anyone lie?
[713.56] What would someone 
benefit out of lying?
[714.76] You will find out
[717.08] what benefit someone has in this.
[721.76] In fact, you do one thing.
[722.96] You have a flight, right? You leave.
[725.32] But remember one thing,
[728.16] when you come back
 after four days,
[729.68] this issue would 
have grown this big.
[734.68] I am in a lot of stress.
[736.32] Such a big businessman,
[738.72] who used to solve such big issues,
 in seconds.
[742.36] And today on this issue…
[743.92] I cannot see Arooj in this condition.
[748.80] Are you embarrassed?
[754.44] No.
[760.60] I am just scared that I would make
 a wrong decision.
[770.76] I will leave.
[773.20] Salman. Salman.
[796.04] I said what I felt.
[800.88] Yes.
[803.84] This is the surprising thing
[805.72] that you said anything to me,
 without thinking.
[811.24] If you had said this to me,
 in another way,
[813.48] then  maybe I wouldn’t 
have disliked it as much
[814.84] as I disliked it right now.
[820.48] I have only met Ammad
 some time back and
[826.72] so much poison has been 
put in your mind.
[833.28] You are making something small, 
into a big issue.
[836.68] You know what the truth is, Salman?
[838.52] You don’t want to hear the truth.
[842.32] This is your biggest issue.
[843.76] Yes, I don’t want to hear it.
[847.40] Because this truth is 
unacceptable for me.
[850.08] This is actually my point.
[852.44] The truth.
[854.52] Meaning, you are believing 
something you have never seen.
[882.88] Yes, mama, go ahead.
[885.24] Where are you, Salman?
[887.84] Why have you not come 
home till now.
[891.08] I am on my way,
[894.24] I am going to the airport.
[896.92] Airport?
[898.64] I am going to Islamabad.
[900.96] You are going to Islamabad?
 But why?
[906.64] I have an important meeting,
[908.96] I am going for that.
[910.88] Why suddenly like this, Salman?
[912.88] You didn’t inform me
 in the morning either.
[916.84] I had to tell you, but I forgot.
[919.36] Okay, when will you come back?
[922.24] It will take me two to four days.
[926.52] Maybe, it will take me 
one or two more days.
[929.84] What is the matter, son?
[932.04] You seem worried to me.
[934.64] Mama, I have no worry.
[937.20] Okay fine. It is okay.
[939.96] Travel safe and take
 care of yourself.
[944.24] Goodbye.
[945.44] Goodbye.
[991.40] Whatever Salman did
 was intolerable.
[999.60] I will say one thing, child.
[1004.64] You don’t run from problems,
[1006.64] you face them.
[1016.36] Look child,
[1018.44] if any misunderstanding happens 
between husband and wife,
[1022.72] then one of the two should move 
forward and clear the thing
[1033.04] or else things get out
 of hand further,
[1040.16] and then, this way,
[1042.04] these baseless allegations
[1044.76] also seem like the truth.
[1052.52] If Salman is misled, then
[1057.40] I will have to remove his
 misunderstanding.
[1063.16] I shouldn’t make my ego 
the wall in my way.
[1069.40] If Salman wants to move 
forward and fix this,
[1074.72] then fine.
[1078.04] I too will have to take a step further.
[1081.92] When two loving people need 
the advice of a third person, then,
[1087.68] there is a crack in the clean
 glass of relationship.
[1106.36] Come in.
[1113.28] Little madam,
[1115.20] the food is ready.
[1116.96] Come on, come and eat it.
[1123.36] I am not hungry.
[1127.88] Bring me coffee.
[1129.52] Don’t take coffee at time of food,
[1132.36] this leads to acidity.
[1135.80] I told you,
[1138.32] I am not hungry.
[1141.24] If a person is worried,
[1143.20] then when do they feel hungry?
[1156.48] Hasn’t Salman come from office?
[1159.92] Or is he in aunt’s room?
[1163.68] She was asking me herself
[1166.40] where little master is.
[1171.48] Then she started to call.
[1175.04] Who? Salman?
[1178.72] Maybe.
[1180.52] But I am not completely sure.
[1185.92] You bring me coffee.
[1188.64] Sure.
[1190.20] As you wish.
[1204.92] Salman is not in the office
 either, then
[1209.44] where can he go at this hour?
[1215.60] I will have to call him now.
[1258.84] I think Salman doesn’t want to talk.
[1421.28] Yes, Nasir, go ahead.
[1423.20] I called just to check if you 
have boarded the flight.
[1427.24] I am on the way.
[1429.40] Look Salman,
[1432.48] ego is like a thin glass wall.
[1437.36] If you want to hurt your head
[1438.64] then it becomes strong
 like a mountain
[1441.60] and if you want to break it down,
[1446.68] then it can be shattered with a touch.
[1449.36] I am myself shattered right now.
[1455.32] And gathering myself 
is really difficult.
[1459.52] It is not difficult, Salman,
[1461.68] if you try.
[1465.48] If one hand would be yours,
[1466.92] and one would belong to sister-in-law
 and they are extended.
[1469.08] But right now, I feel extending 
my hand as my insult.
[1473.76] A void shouldn’t come between 
two loving people.
[1479.12] If the time to decide, passes,
[1483.00] then the distances 
never gets reduced.
[1488.36] Salman.
[1531.20] We will take care 
of it in the meeting.
[1533.64] Okay, I will talk to you later.
[1540.00] Brother Idrees,
[1541.28] what is the meeting to go to which,
[1542.88] Salman didn’t even get the time 
to take his bag from home?
[1548.96] No. what meeting are 
you talking about?
[1550.96] The same meeting he went 
to attend in Islamabad.
[1554.48] Huh?
[1556.08] I don’t think there is
 a meeting in Islamabad.
[1559.68] How is this possible 
brother Idrees,
[1561.28] that you don’t know
 about the meeting
[1563.28] Mehreen, I know everything,
[1564.84] we have not planned any 
such meeting in Islamabad.
[1569.92] Nor do we have 
a client of this level
[1571.88] for which Salman has
 to go for himself.
[1574.92] Then why did Salman
 go to Islamabad,
[1579.08] and that too in this manner…
[1581.04] I am sure.
[1581.84] I am sure he has a problem.
[1584.64] Look Mehreen, there can
 only be two problems,
[1586.60] one in the business and
 the other at home.
[1588.40] Now there is no issue 
in the business,
[1590.20] that leaves the home.
[1591.68] That means there is 
a problem at home,
[1594.80] that is becoming the cause 
of this changed behaviour of Salman.
[1598.56] Yes, 100% correct. That’s how it is.
[1602.44] But if there is a problem, then
[1603.96] where is the problem.
[1605.04] Look, the two of us are standing here.
[1606.56] That leaves Shaista,
[1607.84] she really loves Salman.
[1610.16] That leaves Arooj.
[1616.48] I am sure Arooj is the
 cause of this problem.
[1621.04] Arooj?
[1648.20] Arooj,
[1650.48] what did you do with Salman?
[1654.52] Why are you looking 
at me like a fish?
[1657.60] I am asking you something.
[1659.60] I don’t understand anything aunty.
[1662.28] You are not that unaware either.
[1664.20] You understand well 
what I am asking you.
[1666.56] What have you done that
[1668.08] my son left the home and 
went to Islamabad.
[1671.16] Aunty, I am just finding
 out from you that
[1674.08] Salman is in Islamabad.
[1678.36] Believe me, I don’t know 
anything about this matter,
[1681.00] nor did I talk to Salman.
[1683.40] Yes,
[1684.44] when you upset my son,
[1686.80] then why would he talk to you?
[1688.92] Believe me, I didn’t talk 
to him about anything.
[1691.60] I know nothing about this.
[1693.84] Oh wow, Arooj,
[1695.32] I used to consider 
myself to be smart,
[1697.84] but you are much 
greater than me.
[1700.48] You are getting upset 
with me for no reason.
[1704.16] I honestly don’t know anything.
[1706.68] Arooj,
[1707.64] let me find out once,
[1709.56] then you will see what I will do.
[1800.24] Little madam,
[1803.12] wiping your tears won’t hide them.
[1811.84] In fact, they fall on the inside.
[1818.00] And then they become 
sorrow for the rest of your life.
[1825.92] You are right.
[1828.36] You have given me 
a lot of courage,
[1831.36] you too show some courage.
[1834.44] Here. Have some coffee.
[1838.24] No,
[1841.72] I don’t feel like it.
[1844.52] I know,
[1846.52] little master is a little stubborn.
[1849.96] But he is really naïve.
[1856.40] He gets upset quickly,
[1859.04] but he also agrees quickly too.
[1869.16] I know him since childhood,
[1871.72] I have brought him up in my arms.
[1874.68] I am telling you the truth.
[1877.36] Salman went to Islamabad 
without informing me.
[1885.12] Why did he not tell me? 
I am sad about that.
[1888.36] No, no,
[1889.96] don’t get disheartened.
[1896.88] You know everything 
about me, right?
[1907.44] I still try to stay happy.
[1920.00] You too stay happy, that’s it.
[1941.32] Arooj, here you are upset,
[1943.44] there brother Salman.
[1946.12] One of you will have to remove 
this misunderstanding,
[1949.28] then you do it.
[1951.16] If I have to prove my character 
to remove this misunderstanding,
[1955.12] then I don’t find this right at all.
[1957.68] He should trust me this much
[1960.24] that I am only his.
[1963.04] All the things that 
you are saying to me,
[1965.76] go and say this to 
brother Salman.
[1969.24] I think he should know
 all this himself.
[1974.28] Look Arooj,
[1975.72] Ammad is just a friend of ours,
[1977.88] but your relation with brother
 Salman is more than that.
[2029.04] Why did you call me?
[2031.12] What happened Salman,
[2033.52] that you went to Islamabad 
without informing me?
[2037.92] Who did I not tell?
[2041.16] Me, Salman, who else?
[2044.28] I didn’t find it important.
[2046.48] Meaning, I have no 
importance in your life.
[2053.60] I am your wife.
[2056.48] Did you call me to tell me this?
[2062.12] I have to say a lot,
[2065.52] but you are not ready to listen.
[2070.52] I have no room to listen to anything 
more after all that I have heard from you.
[2080.12] How are you talking to me, Salman?
[2083.28] Don’t you know from
 my attitude that
[2085.32] I don’t want to talk to you?
[2087.72] But why?
[2089.88] You know the reason.
[2178.48] I admit Salman is 
a little emotional,
[2184.44] but nowadays,
 the way he is behaving
[2187.88] is really weird.
[2193.68] If Salman’s behaviour is weird,
[2195.40] then surely something 
has happened.
[2199.80] What has happened?
[2202.04] I think the stories of Arooj and Ammad’s
 friendship have reached Salman.
[2208.52] Friendship?
[2210.80] What friendship?
[2215.12] What do you want to prove repeating 
this again and again?
[2218.44] Hey, what do I want to prove?
[2219.72] The time and situation 
is proving it themselves.
[2224.00] Do you have any idea,
[2226.00] that the spark you are blowing
 on can also catch fire.
[2231.36] Why are you dragging me in this?
[2233.20] Because, instead of fixing Salman,
[2235.56] you are calling him right.
[2239.04] The one you are talking about
[2241.52] is your daughter-in-law.
[2243.20] I am not saying anything 
about my son, right?
[2245.72] Salman loves Arooj,
[2249.76] and you hate her.
[2252.76] Hey, why would I hate her?
[2254.76] But understand one thing well,
[2256.48] that Salman doesn’t love
 Arooj anymore.
