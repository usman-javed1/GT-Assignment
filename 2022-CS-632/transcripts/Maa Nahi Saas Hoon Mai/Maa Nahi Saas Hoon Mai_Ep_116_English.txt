Both of us have been 
deceived by the same person. The only difference is that you don’t want to 
accept that deceit. You are the one who is deceiving by lying that you are Idrees’ wife. You are acting. I came to tell you the truth here. Okay, then tell me, what lie have you
 come up with this time? Tell me. I told you, I don’t want to talk to you. I just want to talk to my husband. That’s it? Don’t say anything more or else I will throw you out. You cannot do this, because both 
our status is the same. We’re both Idress’ wives and both of us have one son. You have told me these 
false stories already. And you must remember, how you left embarrassed. The same thing will happen 
with you this time as well. The truth and
 lie will be revealed soon. And time will also tell 
who will leave this home embarrassed. Fine, then we will decide about this,
 today and right now. You stand up in front
 of Idrees for your right, and wherever you will need me, I will support you at every step. Thank you so much for your love, but now I don’t need 
any help from you, because now I want 
to fight this battle myself. I wish. I wish, you had supported 
me at that time, then you too wouldn’t have
 been sitting in front of me like this. Yes, Shaista. You come back home right now. Why? What happened? That…. that woman, that lying woman has 
come back home today. What, lying woman? The same… that Musarrat, who claims that she is 
your second wife. Hey, you drag her out. How do I drag her out? She has clearly told me that she didn’t come here 
with the intention to leave. So, what does she want? How would I know what she wants? I will know when she talks to me. She wants to talk to you. Okay fine, I am coming. I will come. Come home, immediately. I just came home, you didn’t greet me or anything and you are using 
this tone straight away? To be greeted, you need to ... ...do things that make 
me want to greet you. And you? Hey Musarrat, you were not this
 ill-mannered earlier. Your deception 
wasn’t revealed on me earlier, You have lied so much to me, Idrees, that I have started to hate
 myself for the decision to marry you. Hey, Musarrat, you are my wife. Second. The second wife
 is also a wife, Musarrat. Yes, absolutely. The first wife is living 
in luxuries in a big home, and me and my son, we are caged in this small home. Why are you in such a bad mood?
 What is the matter? My fate is bad. Hey, so everything will be fine. Enough, Idrees. Enough. I don’t want to hear
 any other lie from you. I am tired of hearing your lies. I am surprised. What amazing dreams
 did you show me? Son, we have to look at
 the quotation of Bunyaad Builders, but I am going right now. What happened? All okay? That fraudster, that lying woman is back at home again.
 She is sitting there. What do you mean 
she has come back? How can she come back? What is the matter? I want to know what the matter is,
 that is why I am going. Wait dad You won’t be able to do anything, I will make arrangements for her. Leave it, son. I will handle it. If you were able to handle it, she wouldn’t have come back. I will go with you, 
I will deal with her. She is here. Greetings. Greetings. I will close it. Did Areej bother you? If Areej bothers me, 
then she has a right. I didn’t have you to bother me,
 at this age. Now Areej will do it. This is also right. I will serve food for you. You must be tired. No, no, mama, I had lunch. I just had a lot of work at the office, I am really tired. Look Arooj, if the workload is a lot, then quit it. God will be kind, manage to get through life. Your life doesn’t pass by quitting work. To live your life, you have to fight, you have to snatch your right. All these things only sound good. Taking your right is really difficult. It is not impossible, though. So, what will you do? I will do something. I have thought about it. What will you do? Wont you tell me? You will be the first person
 I will tell when the time comes. Look Arooj, remember one thing, we are really weak people. Showing yourself as weak,
 is strengthening the enemy. Fine. Whatever you do, do it really carefully. Because now I don’t have 
the courage to hear any bad news. Don’t worry, your daughter will not be unsuccessful. You have brought up Salman really well. You have brought him 
up as an exemplary mother. But he has lost his way, mama, and there is no way to return. This is equally painful 
for me as it is for you. But I feel the sooner we accept this, the better it will be for me. If a modest person steps
 back from a person, then the immodest person
 feels they are cowards. And do you know? Not raising your voice for your rights
 is also a great ingratitude to God. I have decided, I will stand up for my right. And now, I will not
 listen to anyone of you. Where is that Musarrat? Yes. She is sitting inside, in the lounge. Mom, we wouldn’t have
 had to come here, if you had dragged her out. Yes. She is sitting here strongly. If she had made noise at the door, then what could we have done? Child, Shaista is right, there should be no noise. Don’t worry, if she does this, then I will shut her up. Come Idrees. Tell her. Tell her what her worth is. Idrees, tell her, who am I? what am I? We know who you are, but we want to hear 
it from your mouth once. Me? I am a mother. Whose mother? I am the mother of Idrees’ son. I am the mother of Idrees’ son. And here is my son. Yes, and Idrees just doesn’t have one son. You are lying. You have come up with this story,
 seeing our wealth and money. Okay, lets believe it for a while, that you are speaking the truth. But do you have any proof that you are Idrees’ wife, huh? Proof? Here is the proof. Our wedding papers. We have been married
 for fourteen years. Idrees. Idrees, what is she saying? What is she saying? Answer me. Is she speaking the truth. It is nothing, such wedding papers
 can be made easily. Yes. After all, no one will believe these 
fake wedding papers of yours, so it will be better that 
you leave from here. I came here to get my right, and I will leave when I get it. I need respect, I need a name. What right? When you have no relation with him, then what right have 
you come here to claim? If I don’t get my right, then I will take help from the law. And remember, I will take my right So, you will take me to court? Yes. I will take you to the court and I will also handover your son to you, so that he gets your name. You have humiliated me in my home. No door for compromise is left open. Cunning woman, I will not let you cause any more pain. You wait here. Wait. Here you go. Your divorce papers. From now on, you are free. Yes. I hid it from you, forgive me. I am really tired. I don’t want this paper. I want my right. My wedding gift. How much is your wedding gift? Twenty-five hundred 
thousand rupees. Here you go. Don’t come here again. I will have to come. To take the right of my son. I am leaving from here right now, but I will surely come again. What was all this? You had married for 
the second time, that too hiding it from mom? I didn’t put any allegation. Uncle got married and getting married is not a sin. Arooj don’t say anything
 baseless in front of me. I am telling you. I didn’t say anything baseless. Arooj, I am warning you, stop all this or you
 will see the worst in me. I am speaking the truth, Salman. I have met her myself. Shaista, listen to me. I don’t want to hear anything. I don’t want to. You have cheated me. You kept on lying again and again. I am so stupid. I considered you to be honest and considered that 
woman to be bad. Look, whatever happened,
 it hurt you. Forgive me for this. I should forgive you? You have lied to two 
women at the same time and you are saying
 it so easily that I should forgive you? Mom. Please, take it easy. How do I take it easy? How can I take it easy,
 finding out all this? Mom, look, when you found out the truth, the next moment it ended as well. You didn’t even have 
to face a moment of pain. And can you not 
see what I am feeling? I understand this, but please, you try to forget this. Salman, is…right… Mom. Mom. Okay, lets believe it for a while, that you are speaking the truth. But do you have any proof that you are Idrees’ wife, Proof? Here is the proof. Our wedding papers. We have been married 
for fourteen years. Mom. Please, take it easy. Mom, look, when you found out the truth, the next moment it ended as well. You didn’t even have 
to face a moment of pain. And can you not 
see what I am feeling? I understand this, but please, you try to forget this. I forget it? How can I forget it? How? Idrees brought 
my lifelong hard work, my love, my wishes, my sacrifices ... ...to the ground in one moment. I trusted you so much, Idrees. I couldn’t even think, Idrees, that you would do this with me. Why did you do this? Why did you do it? Why? Why has she called me? Why did you call me? To tell you, aunt, that a person reaps 
what they sow. You deceived 
people all their lives. You have murdered their trust, but maybe you had 
forgotten something, that is karma. Stop your nonsense. Did you call me to 
speak this nonsense? Aunt, I can understand the pain and torture you 
are going through right now. Hun... Who told you that
 I am in pain? Closing your eyes, 
doesn’t change the reality, aunt. Do you remember aunt? You have helped me
a lot in my difficult times. That’s why I too thought that I would console you 
a little in your difficult times. That was my fault. I mistook a snake for a rope.”. Arooj, I made a mistake
 in recognizing you. No, no, no, aunt. Not me, actually, you have made 
a mistake in recognizing uncle. He belonged to aunt 
Musarrat fourteen years back. Shut up. Just shut up. Be strong aunt, the game has just begun. And remember, God’s stick is soundless and when it tightens, it jolts sinners like 
you to their senses.
