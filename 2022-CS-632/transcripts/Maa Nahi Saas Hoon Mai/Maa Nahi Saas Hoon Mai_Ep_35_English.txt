Salman. What is the matter, son? Where are you leaving so early in
the morning without having breakfast? I am going to the office, I will have breakfast there. You look worried to me. No, I have no worry. First, you should tell everything
to your mother, but fine, if you want to hide it,
then up to you. But Salman, think about one thing. Since you have been married, since then you have
started to stay worried. Goodbye. Goodbye. Nothing has happened till now, but I am scared it will
surely happen now. What will happen? Something really bad. If you don’t stop putting poison in
Salman’s heart towards Arooj. What did I do? Please, Mehreen, I know it all. I had stopped you that whatever
you are thinking is wrong and I have to save Salman
from this wrong thinking of yours. But you did what you wanted. Come in. Wasai, once Arooj leaves her room, then tell me. Sure. What happened yesterday? Where did Wasai take you? Is there any point in telling you. If I find out the issue,
then we will decide if there is a point or not, or will you make all the
decisions yourself? Salman and Arooj had
a misunderstanding, I was clearing it out. Why did you go? What do you mean,
why did I do? Is it forbidden to make
children understand? If children make mistakes in anger,
in their stupidity, if they become stubborn, they become overconfident, then isn’t it our responsibility... ... making them understand and
showing him the right path? These philosophy and
statements of responsibility makes no difference to Mehreen. Had she come there
and seen you and told you stay away from
Salman’s matters, then wouldn’t things have gotten bad? So how could she see it? She is the one who started this fire. And after all, if me, Salman’s real
mother sort out ... ...the issues between
Salman and Arooj, then who will? And how long do I let my son suffer
because of Mehreen’s stupidity? We cannot say this openly. But we can call for truce during
the call for war, right? We are elders, don’t we have a right? We don’t fulfill our
responsibility? should we not act smart? Fine, keep it up. I will go. Boss, you called for poor old me? Come. Come. Come. Now you will not stay poor. You look really happy. What scheme did you
get your hands on? The matters with AAZ Advertising
have been fixed. They will bill as per our liking, they will take their cost and
we will take our share. Boss, I won’t be able to
support you this time. I am scared. You are saying no to me? I think you are bored of your job. The way, madam Arooj is
revealing our cheating, she will also strip us some day. Boss, I will lose the job,
then respect too. You think she found
a proof against us? If this was true, then we would have been in a problem
a long time back. It is possible she knows,
and she is quiet. She is not that good. And after all, she is alone, she is weak. Not alone, boss. Now Ammad is there with her. Arrangements will be
made for him soon, you just tell me, do you want to earn money or will you cry like this? Boss, money is such that a person agrees to give
their life for it. I am with you, order me. Look at this file, then I will tell you what
we have to do. Fine, boss. Fine. Leave. I am not disappointed that you got angry with me. I am disappointed that you put such a cheap
allegation on me. And maybe I will remember
this all my life. But you know Salman, a thought like this cannot
come in your mind. You are a good friend of mine,
well-wisher. That well-wisher, who has the cure for everything. How did you say this? Excuse me, sir. I wanted your signatures on this file. Excuse me, sir. Get lost! I had said no one will disturb me. Go from here. Arooj, you are wasting your
time beating about the bush. I am not beating about the bush, I am talking about you and me. I am saying what I have learned in this one year
old relationship of ours. Okay, fine, then, why did you not answer the
question I asked you? What should I think? Arooj, child. You are here. Why are you not in the office? Everyone must be waiting for you. I am coming from there. Then why are you standing here? Then where do I go, aunt? Child, Salman is like that. A little emotional and a little stupid. He is not stupid at all. Fine, I agree he is not stupid, but he is an idiot, you will
agree to this, right? What do you think? Now you are trying to make me laugh. Yes, child. So what is the harm in laughing,
huh? I know what happened last night. Salman’s behaviour and attitude,
hurt you, right? But child, this is Salman’s way
of showing his love. So Salman should show his love, why is he scaring me? Now you found out he is like this. Stubborn and short tempered. But child, he really loves you. I am sure. Come on, now fix your mood. Tell me, what will you drink? Tea? Coffee? Or orange juice? I will have anything. Look Salman, thinking and worrying like
this will not sort this matter. Come home and finish
this drama of the office, all the issues will be sorted. No, uncle. Arooj is doing all this
out of her interest. You will continue to fulfill
someone’s interest? What does business have to do
with someone’s interest? If you cannot close down the
office at home, then at least, fire that Ammad, who is
the root to this issue. Rest, is up to you, child. I think Salman realized his mistake. He is calling to say sorry. Hello. Hello. How are you? I am fine. If you want to say sorry,
then go ahead. I am waiting. I will say sorry when
I think I am wrong If you want to prove me wrong, then fire Ammad from this job. You said what you wanted to. You did what you wanted. Now hear what I am saying. Ammad will not go anywhere from here. Okay? Sir actually, this land is costing us a lot. I think we shouldn’t work
on this land further, the land is really rocky. Meaning, we will have to spend
a lot of money to make the base. Absolutely sir. I think we should quit this project. Valid point. Salman. Salman. Huh? What is your opinion on this? What opinion? I am really sorry guys, we will talk about this later. Meeting over. What happened to Mr. Salman? Nothing. You keep this file in my room, I will check it again. Right sir. and we cannot trust the soil testing. We will do the testing again and decide after that. In fact, you give this file to Nawaz. Nawaz, come to my room. You said what you wanted to. You did what you wanted. Now hear what I am saying. Ammad will not go
anywhere from here. Arooj is the one who pushed
me towards doubt. I didn’t believe what anyone said because I trust Arooj the most. But she took a stand for
Ammad in front of me? When trust breaks,
doubts are born and when the doubts
become strong, everything breaks. I know what happened last night. Salman’s behaviour and
attitude, hurt you, right? But child, this is Salman’s way
of showing his love. If you want to say sorry,
then go ahead. I am waiting. I will say sorry when
I think I am wrong If you want to prove me wrong, then fire Ammad from this job. Little madam. Yes, Wasai? Are you crying? When you cannot control
anyone, then you cannot control yourself either. But what will crying
do little madam? I know. But at least the burden on
the heart will reduce. Why did you come?
Do you want something? Madam Shanzay is here. I have seated her in the lounge. You tell her I am coming. Sure. It is all a lie. This love, this loyalty, it is all a lie. You are a liar, Arooj. Your love, your loyalty, is all just for show. You are a liar, Arooj. You are a liar! You are a liar. How are you Shanzay? I am fine, how are you? I am fine. Have a seat. What is the matter? Your eyes don’t support
your words. Maybe fate is not supporting
me nowadays. What happened Arooj? All okay? Shanzay, when does doubt make
a place in the heart? When love is intense. Meaning? Meaning, when you have intense love, then you also have intense doubt. But why are you asking me all this? Because the wall of doubts has
come between Salman and I. Why? What happened? Salman wants that I fire Ammad. Salman is the CEO of this company, he must have some logic… He has no logic, he has a reason. What reason? He feels that I am frank with Ammad. If all this is happening
cause of this Ammad, then you throw him out. What is there to worry about in this? It is not about firing him, Shanzay. It is a question on my character. Then answer this question my love, fire him. Salman should be more
important for you, instead of Ammad. Fine. You are absolutely right. You come with me, and then you decide that should I fire Ammad from the job
because of a small doubt or not? Come on. Have a seat. I will call Ammad. I think he is not on his seat. Let me call on his mobile. Hello. Hello. Where are you? I am in the accounts department. Okay, come to my room immediately. Okay, I will come. You do one thing, take out the six month statement, I will check it when I come. He is coming. Okay listen, don’t mention Salman
in front of Ammad, please. Or else we will
have a big issue. Fine. Hello Shanzay, how are you? Ammad, you? What a surprise. I thought I would surprise you two. Really amazing, surprise. Have a seat. Thank you. By the way, I was completely sure you would
come here searching for me. You have not gotten out
of the habit of flirting. Get serious. With you? Go wash your face. I am not going through such
bad times right now. You know Shanzay, Ammad is an expert in his work. He handles the finance for
this entire department. Yes, he is an expert
in everything. By the way, Ammad, I am really happy to
see you here today. Yes, by the way, even I am really happy seeing
you here after so long. Did you get married? No Ammad, you know my mama is so unwell, how can I get married? I have to take care of her. Yes, you know both our
lives are similar. My mama too is a cancer
patient and… Okay tell me, will you
have tea or coffee? What would you have? I will have tea. Arooj, Ammad has not changed at all. He is the same. Full of life. Yes, now you saw it with your own eyes, you must believe me now. Yes, but, Arooj only you and I know this, not brother Salman. Then what do I do? Look, firstly, you will have to remove 
this misunderstanding of brother Salman. Because your relation with 
brother Salman is not like that you don’t give importance 
to this issue. Really? Fine. I will fire Ammad. Then? Then will I be able to remove
 my doubts from Salman’s heart? Brother Salman doesn’t 
have a doubt, he has a misunderstanding and it is better to remove 
that misunderstanding soon. Because you take this seriously. Then you tell me, what do I do? You go and talk about all 
this with brother Salman, so that this problem gets solved. To talk to Salman, I will have to say sorry to him. Then say it. Shanzay, here we are talking about 
my character. How do I say sorry? In fact, he should say sorry to me. Arooj, here you are upset, 
there brother Salman. One of you will have to remove
 this misunderstanding, then you do it. If I have to prove my character 
to remove this misunderstanding, then I don’t find this right at all. He should trust me this 
much that I am only his. All the things that you 
are saying to me, go and say this to brother Salman. I think he should know 
all this himself. Look Arooj, Ammad is just a friend of ours, but your relation with brother 
Salman is more than that. If I fire Ammad, then this thing is proven that there was really 
something between us. Look Arooj, I will not call the angle you 
are thinking with wrong. Actually, Shanzay, Salman has considered my love poor.
