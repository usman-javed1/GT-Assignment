Why did you come here? To meet you. Why do you want to meet me? What is the reason? Why are you not meeting me? Say what you have 
come here to say. I know well,
why you have come here. So, it will be better for you 
to tell me clearly. How can you talk to me like this? Really? So, now you will teach me
 how I should talk. Tell me, what have you come here for? Salman, you kept on walking on the terrace 
all night long. You didn’t even come to the room. I know you are worried. Won’t you share it with me? Why should I share it with you? Because I am your wife. Wife? You are only aunt Mehreen’s daughter. Okay, so you have found out. I had thought I would tell you myself, but you had promised me that you will help me in finding my parents. Forgive me, considering it a mistake. How can you be so stone hearted? She loves you so much. You know, she has not slept for two nights. 
So, what do I do? I have not taken up the responsibility
of showing mercy on someone. Salman. She is not someone. She has loved you for 
twenty-five years. She is your mother, and you are still calling her
aunt Mehreen. Really? So you tell me. Tell me, what should I call her
if I don’t call her aunt Mehreen? Someone else has brought 
me up as well. But I still consider her 
my mother till today. It is not necessary that 
I think the same way as you. I am really sorry, man. I don’t know what happens to me, and then everything gets ruined. This is my fault. I admit it. Right now, I want to stay here with my parents. But, why? I have to search for my parents. I get lost in myself going
 to that home, then how would I be able 
to search anyone else? So, I will help you find them. I am with you. I am really sorry. My information turned out 
to be wrong and that family was 
not your family. Your hope broke. What are you saying? You tried, you supported me. Rest is up to fate. I am really hopeful that you will find your family soon. I will go now. Take care of yourself. Listen, thank you, for trying for me. Arooj. Did you meet Salman? How was your meeting? I don’t know what has happened? He is not ready to hear anything. Now this puppet show is over. Salman will not listen to you 
or Mehreen, because he has learned that I am his father and 
Shaista is his mother. Even if Salman has found out 
about this, then what is the reason for hating 
my mother and I? Very smart. You have found out really soon 
that Salman hates you. Yes, but why? It is better that you don’t get 
into this argument, and prepare to leave from 
Salman’s life, now. What are you saying? I am Salman’s wife. More than that you are 
Mehreen’s daughter. Okay, so Salman is speaking 
your language. See how you are talking and Shaista will stop 
this tongue on yours, because you are her 
daughter-in-law and she is your mother-in-law. I have not taken up the responsibility
 of showing mercy on someone. She has loved you for 
twenty-five years. She is your mother, and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen. Really? So you tell me. Tell me, what should I call her if I don’t 
call her aunt Mehreen? Someone else has brought 
me up as well. But I still consider her 
my mother till today. It is not necessary that 
I think the same way as you. A game has been played 
with my life. I have been afflicted by a really 
deep oddity, in a moment. I am trying hard to understand
 your emotions, but I am unable to understand. I am in a lot of pain. I am unable to focus in any work. I hate everything, every relation 
seems meaningless to me. Salman, sister-in-law too went
 through a similar situation. She too has gotten a grip 
on herself with difficulty. No, man, she disappeared, 
she got lost. My own parents handed me 
over to someone else. How do I accept it? Salman, I agree to 
everything you say, I just don’t understand what is the reason to hate 
sister-in-law, Arooj? I hate myself, how will I 
hate someone else? Anyway, I won’t be able to sit anymore. Salman, sit, man. A little longer, please. Salman. Now tell me, what you feel after hearing 
all that I said? Will Salman leave me? Arooj, I don’t understand 
brother Salman at all. Earlier he used to listen 
to aunt Mehreen, and now his parents. Why doesn’t he think 
anything himself? I don’t understand 
what Salman wants. Arooj, I feel he is going through 
a big shock, you should let him be. Will doing this be right? Man, that’s what I believe in. And if things get further out of hand? Pray for me, Shanzay. My heart is really worried. Okay, you don’t worry. You know you are a really brave girl. Nothing will happen. I will leave for home, then. Areej is alone at home, 
I have left her with mama. She must be waiting. Man, you should have stayed 
for a while. Have tea. Some other time. Take lots of care of yourself. 
No need to worry. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Salman. It is good that you came, son. I was waiting for you, 
for a long time. Don’t mind, I was waiting for you. There is no need for you 
to wait for me. What is wrong, Salman? You can talk to me with 
love as well. After all, for years… What had to happen, what had to pass,
 has passed. Now you don’t need to drag me
in my past, aunt Mehreen. Aunty? You called me aunty? Yes, I did. And I will call you the same 
in future as well. All of you. Especially you. You ruined my life. To save your life, you took away 
my entire childhood. Salman. 
Stay away. Go away from me. There is no need for you to come 
near me in future. Salman. You have found your daughter, save these emotions for her. Did you see, Mehreen, how I played the entire game, and I also won. What did you win? How I took back my son from you, that too with full profit. My son, Salman, is the only owner of this entire 
property and business. So, you are admitting it yourself that you did this cheap action? You will get the answer for this when Salman will be left with me, and you will be all alone. I couldn’t even think that someone can plan 
so mercilessly. Please, keep these dialogues of yours 
to yourself. You know, should I tell you
 the truth? I feel bad for you. Mehreen, you have become
so helpless. I am not your son, and neither are you my mother. In future, don’t call me your son. Mama. Mama, what happened? Did someone say something? Tell me. Salman. Salman has started to hate me. Salman shouldn’t hate me, 
no issues. But don’t hate me either. I didn’t let him leave my lap 
for a lot of years, and today, when I want to extend my hand 
and touch him, he shuns me away. So, why are you expecting 
love from him? I am not expecting it, 
I am begging for it. Stop it, mama. Stop it. Surely, you are telling me less. I know Salman well. When he starts misbehaving, 
he doesn’t care. I will take care of him right now. 
No Arooj. No, you will not say anything 
to Salman. When do you get love, 
asking for it? If he doesn’t care for you, then I am here, your daughter. Will your daughter not be enough 
to satisfy your desire for motherhood? Salman, do you know why 
I gifted you this watch? Why? So that you can look at the time 
and come home early next time. In fact, there is another special 
thing about this watch. Really? What is that? I have set everyone’s birthday 
alarm in this watch. Really? But I am not interested in remembering
 anyone’s birthday. I just want to remember your birthday. I knew it, that is why only your and my reminder
is set in this watch. Really?
Yes. Thank you so much Arooj, for making my day. You know what?
Yes? I love you so much I love you too. Little master, I have kept your tea. Come on, come and have it. Where did you keep it? The same place you drink it 
daily in the evening. I will never go there now. Bring my tea here. Sure. Here you go, your gift. Mom, what is this? Open it and see for yourself. How do you like it? Mom, this is… This is really cute, aunty. You gave a really good present
to Salman. You know Salman, this is the gift from 
your first birthday. Thank you again, mom. Love you. Hello. What is the problem, Mussarat? Why are you calling me 
again and again? I have told you, I am home, 
don’t you understand? How are you talking to me, Idrees. I am your wife, not your maid. Okay. Okay. Don’t mind. 
Tell me, what is the matter? I don’t want anything. Your son is insisting that call papa, I want to go for an outing. Hey you handle him. 
How can I come right now? I have told him this already, get a grip on yourself son, because your father has been taking
 us for a ride for so long, by lying to us repeatedly. You know coming over daily is not easy. I am busy here. Idrees, you had told me that after 
marriage, you will shift to Karachi, or you will call me to you
in Islamabad. Here, our son has turned ten, and you have not fulfilled 
any promise of yours. Tell me, do you have an answer for all this. Okay. Okay. Be quiet now. I will come over to your place
in a day or so, we will sit and talk comfortably. Yes. Yes. I have told my PA, 
he will email you. Don’t worry, 
you work will be done. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Okay. Okay. Goodbye. Hey, Shaista. All okay? Who are you talking to standing
in the corner here? There were no signals, that’s why. Come on. 
Sure. Fine, Idrees. This time you come to Karachi, we will talk to face to face this time.
