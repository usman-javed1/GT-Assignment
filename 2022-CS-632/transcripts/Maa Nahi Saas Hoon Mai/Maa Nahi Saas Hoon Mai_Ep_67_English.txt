Nature has brought me so close, 
Wasai. Me getting married and 
coming to this home. Seeing the picture in your room 
changed my life. What is it that I just heard? What is happening in this home? What secret is Arooj hiding? What picture were these two 
talking about? I will go check Wasai’s quarter. God blessed us and 
both of us survived. She got injuries on the head, she also has some injuries, but she still hasn’t regained 
consciousness. did you find out anything 
about the child? No, we didn’t find out anything. Twenty four hours have passed. God knows, some animal must have 
eaten her till now. Shaista, what are you saying? Say something good. I don’t know what condition 
my innocent child will be in. If God wills she will be fine. Wherever she is, 
she will come home. You have had this file for so long, 
and you have not completed the work. Take this file and complete the work. 
Leave. Okay, sir. Yes, Shaista, go ahead. Come home as soon as possible,
 Idrees. Is everything okay? What happened? Think that what never shouldn’t 
have happened, has happened. Why are you talking in riddles? 
Tell me, what happened? Idrees, you come home, 
I am not talking in riddles. I have a really important meeting 
in the office. Now, there is no point in 
any meeting Idrees. Everything will be ruined. You just come home soon. 
Please. Boss, where are you going? 
It is almost time for the meeting. I am going home, 
there is an emergency. Mr. Salman is not there either, 
you had to head the meeting. Cancel the meeting, my mind is 
caught up, we will talk later. The client is coming from Islamabad, 
and I should cancel the meeting? I feel really like seeing you 
happy like this. Always stay happy like this. I got the happiness of being a mother. Okay, what else did the doctor say? The doctor said everything is fine,
 nothing to worry about. Thank God. You know, whether it is a son or a daughter, 
I want that they are healthy. Thank God. May God always keep you people 
together and happy like this. Amen.
Amen. Did my son eat anything? I don’t want to eat anything. Why don’t you want to eat? Send away all the guests from here, 
we will go to our room. Okay, we will go just now. 
We will go in a little while. Mischievous. Son, Salman, come on, 
let’s go to our room. Sister in law…
I said come to your room. What is wrong sister in law Shaista? Why do you insist? Salman is already in a bad mood. His mood will be fine. 
Don’t worry. What happened? 
What is the worry? Idrees, worry is a small word. Now a big destruction will happen. Shaista, I am already worried, 
don’t scare me more. What is the matter? Mehreen’s daughter disappeared, 
right? Yes, so what? Do you know where she is? We know nothing about her. Now you take out this thought 
from your heart and mind. That girl is present in this home. What do you mean? In this home? Arooj is Mehreen’s lost daughter. Mehreen’s lost daughter Areej is Arooj? Who told you this? I heard Wasai and Arooj talking myself. What is the proof of this? I saw the old picture in Wasai’s room. You had made Wasai burn 
that picture, right? You look at Wasai’s disobedience, look at her courage, 
she had kept that picture safe. That picture has revealed the secret. Whatever has happened is not right. The one who we had 
put out of the game, she has come back to the game 
as your daughter in law. Wasai, keep this file in my room and 
get us good tea. Yes, younger madam. Where does Wasai keep these things?
I don’t find them on time. Where could she keep it? Congratulations, mom. You are going to be a grandmother. God heard your prayers. Really? What is the matter, mom? Are you not happy? Are you happy? That is enough. What do you mean? You really wanted that I become a father 
and you become a grandmother. Yes But right now you become happy that at least you are going to get 
some happiness from this Arooj. Or else this girl has always 
given you sorrow. Arooj, I have noticed that despite mom’s strict tone, 
you were smiling. What is the matter? 
What happened? Are you jealous? I am not jealous. By the way, there was something. What? Your mood has changed but mom is the same. At times a person should 
make the first move and if you make the first move 
in love, you surely get a response in return. Yes, you are right. Okay, I will go get fresh. Child, take care of yourself. I don’t want to break your courage, but in this condition 
you need to rest, and you are running around. The condition and situation 
forced me, mama or else I never wanted to 
put myself in this effort. Can I give you an advice? Yes. Keep Salman aware of your matters, he is your well-wisher. Think something Idrees. Think what we should do? I am thinking. I am thinking, but my mind is not working. I made all this game for 
my son Salman and Arooj became the owner 
of the entire business. The game hasn’t been spoiled 
this much. Your daughter is law is the owner
 of this business. You are forgetting, Arooj is Mehreen’s daughter 
before being my daughter in law. If everything belongs to Arooj, then including Salman all of us 
are dependent on her. She had already entered 
this business, now she will come with 
much more force. I already felt that 
she is something else. I had my doubts. I am so sorry.
I am so sorry, Idrees. I unknowingly always took Arooj’s side. Although Mehreen was right, what she did with Arooj was right. This Arooj deserves this. Whatever Mehreen did with 
Arooj was absolutely right. One picture. She just sees one picture and says that 
this is me and I am the daughter of this home. Just one picture. But she makes the claim with so much 
confidence, like she some other proof too. We don’t have to look away 
in this matter, we will have to face this situation 
face to face or else we will be out of this game. The game that was planned for years, will get turned over in moments. Oh my God. I didn’t think this. Idrees think Arooj’s bad days 
have started. How is that? Leave that to me. These are the papers of 
Mr. Waqar’s wealth and business and according to this, now the owner of all these things 
is Mr. Waqar’s widow, Mehreen and her daughter Areej. What are you say, Mr. Lawyer? Everything has been put in Mehreen 
and Areej’s name? No, no, this is not possible. But I made these papers on 
the instructions of late Mr. Waqar and Mr. Idrees knows that I am 
the legal advisor of the company, so madam, this is an entrustment
 with me. I would want that 
you keep them safe. You see, see what is going on. The home has become an office 
and the office, home. I am worried and you are happy. Everything, that is done 
against Mehreen, I am happy about that. Thank God, someone is fearless enough 
to teach Mehreen a lesson. You are worried about Mehreen and 
you are not paying attention to what I said. I am paying attention, I always pay attention, but you make me be quiet. But Arooj always finds her way. I am looking at my son, and the frown on my son’s 
forehead tells me there is some issue. Look son, Salman, I know you have a misunderstanding
 towards Arooj in your heart. No. There is no misunderstanding. Beliefs are not wrong, aunt. Child Arooj is a really good girl. You are having a bad heart 
towards her for no reason. Son, whatever doubts you have 
taken them and throw them out. This Arooj is really stubborn. See, she is standing in front of me 
after ruining my entire plan. No, how is this possible? The same girl comes 
in the way again? That’s not possible. Anyway, this time is the last time. Arooj you have seen Shaista’s love. Now also see her hatred too. Wasai, what are you cooking? Little master, I am making 
your favorite biryani. It is cooking, it will be ready in fifteen minutes, till then I will make salad for you. Little master, are you hungry? No, I am not hungry right now. Okay, then my little master 
must want coffee. No, I don’t even want coffee right now. So little master, you tell me yourself what do you want that 
you came to the kitchen. Do you remember, when I was young, you didn’t let me enter the kitchen. Yes, yes, little master, I remember everything. I even remember when you used to put everything 
of mine out of place. Okay tell me, what did you make for Arooj? Younger madam asked me 
for soup half an hour later. Okay fine, tell me as soon as 
the soup is ready, I will take it for Arooj myself. Yes, little master, as you order. God, always keep my little master and younger madam happy like this. Amen. Shaista. Shaista, think once more 
about what you are going to do. The time to think has passed, the water is above over head. If we think more, 
we will drown. We will drown anyway, 
think if we get caught, then? You think that I am so stupid that I do something that 
I get caught. Never. What stupidity is this? Salman will go crazy 
if something happens to Arooj, to find out who her murderer is. and if Arooj lives, we will not have anything 
in our hands. Nothing. So, we will have to remove Arooj 
from our way. Even I want that because 
with Arooj there, we have nothing but humiliation 
in our fate. Then let me do it. Let me do what I want to do. Don’t worry.
