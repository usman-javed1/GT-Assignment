[45.52] Salman,
[48.04] come on, have dinner, please.
[51.40] I don’t want to eat.
[53.04] Why?
[54.44] Why don’t you want to eat?
[59.16] What am I asking you?
[66.36] Why are you asking me?
[68.88] Why are you asking?
[73.40] Do you even care about me?
[76.08] You did what you wanted to,
[78.16] and because of that,
 I shouldn’t have done what I did.
[81.60] What is wrong Salman
[83.88] that you are misbehaving with
 your mother like this?
[86.12] You don’t care about me at all.
[88.00] You only care about yourself.
[93.04] Salman, my love,
[95.96] I am only living for you.
[98.92] Then why don’t you care 
about my happiness?
[102.76] You are doing all this for that girl?
[106.56] Yes, I am doing it.
[108.00] I am surely doing it because of her.
[109.56] But you don’t understand.
[112.36] But I will tell you one thing,
[115.76] I will make sure I get that girl.
[119.44] Then you too remember one thing,
[122.40] I will never let that happen.
[128.40] Then fine,
[130.48] you live in this grand home 
with this decision of yours.
[134.68] I am leaving this 
home and going.
[136.12] What do you mean 
you are going,
[136.60] leaving this home? 
Salman.
[138.84] Salman. Salman,
 listen to me…
[145.52] Salman.
[147.60] Salman, stop.
[148.68] Salman, son, listen to me.
 Salman.
[151.72] Salman, listen…
[152.72] Salman.
[155.28] Salman, where are you going? 
Stop, son.
[158.48] Salman.
[159.64] Where is he going?
[160.84] You go and stop him.
[162.08] Look at him.
[162.96] Nothing will happen,
 he will come
[164.56] He will come back.
[166.72] Do you see?
[167.72] Do you see brother Idrees?
[168.84] Salman left the home and went.
[170.64] And you know why?
[172.04] Because of a girl.
[175.88] My Salman, my son,
[177.64] left his mother for 
the sake of a girl.
[180.72] Don’t worry, Mehreen, 
Salman will come.
[182.64] How will he not come?
[183.80] I will not let him stay outside 
the home like this.
[186.64] I have brought him up.
[188.04] How can I handover 
my son to someone like this,
[190.84] and I stay empty handed myself.
[193.88] No. How can this happen?
[197.32] You do something.
[198.88] You go and check
 where he went.
[201.16] God forbid,
[201.96] what if he does something 
with himself.
[203.48] Shaista, Salman is not that stupid.
[205.88] Remain calm. Please.
[207.84] Idrees, you don’t understand.
[209.36] Listen to me. Idrees.
[221.12] Your mom is just like you.
[226.12] Take her into confidence.
[228.08] She won’t surrender so easily.
[230.20] Yes, fine, then,
[232.32] I am also her son.
[235.56] I don’t understand
[236.48] why mama doesn’t get
[237.64] how important that girl is for me.
[244.00] Urooj is my stubbornness
[249.00] and also my love.
[250.76] Salman, remain calm.
[253.08] This insistence of yours 
is ruining everything.
[255.76] At times you go to that girls home,
[257.92] at times you leave
 your home and go.
[258.96] I don’t understand why 
mama doesn’t get it?
[262.32] I have tried in every 
possible way,
[264.72] there is no point.
[276.32] Hey, where would he have gone?
[277.88] He would have gone to Nasir.
[280.80] You just tell me something,
[283.68] if Salman likes a girl,
[287.12] then what problem
 does Mehreen have?
[291.68] You know what the problem is.
[293.20] Mehreen cannot tolerate that
[294.52] someone else shows 
their right on Salman
[298.00] and if Salman comes 
home with his love,
[300.32] then you think yourself
[301.28] what condition Mehreen will be in.
[303.08] You mean to say that Salman 
will never get married?
[308.72] She will get married,
[310.28] but when Mehreen likes a girl.
[312.72] Hah,
[314.08] the mental state Mehreen is in,
[316.44] I don’t think Salman is going to 
get married any time soon.
[321.08] But Idrees, I am telling you,
[323.36] I cannot see my son 
suffering like this.
[326.64] He will get married where he wants.
[329.52] What will you do?
[330.72] I will do anything,
[332.64] but I will support 
Salman completely.
[335.52] You will not do any stupidity like this.
[338.08] What do you mean?
[340.24] See, Idrees, till it was 
about my existence,
[343.48] it was fine,
[346.12] but for Salman I will not 
be a silent spectator.
[349.96] Have you gone mad? Be quiet.
[352.20] I will not be quiet.
[355.80] But you don’t worry.
[357.92] Whatever I will do,
[359.92] I will do it after thinking.
[380.68] You are doing all this for that girl?
[384.60] I am surely doing it because of her.
[387.04] But I will tell you one thing,
[389.76] I will make sure I get that girl.
[459.44] Aunty wouldn’t have 
sit down comfortably.
[463.16] Neither will the poor 
thing sleep tonight.
[475.48] Aunty’s Call...
[476.52] No need to attend it.
[478.24] Oh please,
[479.92] this is against manners okay?
[480.96] And I have to go meet her later.
[484.72] Greetings aunty.
[486.64] Greetings Nasir.
[488.96] Is Salman at your place?
[490.76] Yes, yes, aunt, he is here.
[494.12] Let me talk to him.
[497.28] Aunty, he went to the washroom.
[500.92] Once he comes, I will 
make you talk to him.
[504.04] Okay,
[506.16] so this means
[507.68] my son doesn’t want to talk to me.
[514.60] Okay fine, goodbye.
[538.08] Rehman baba,
[540.72] take out the car.
[565.48] No brother, no.
[566.80] I am really scared of aunt.
[568.88] Did you see?
[570.28] I told her you are in the washroom,
[571.80] she caught me immediately.
[574.76] Don’t take aunt lightly.
[577.68] That is why I make you understand
[580.28] that take her into confidence,
[582.12] don’t fight with her too much.
[587.04] You don’t know her 
better than me.
[663.28] What was the need for you 
to come to Nasir’s home?
[665.92] What do you mean?
[667.60] You leave the home and go,
[668.68] and I don’t even come to look for you?
[669.68] I am asking you something else, 
mama.
[672.00] You tell me yourself,
[673.76] if I had an argument with you there,
[675.36] and refused to come,
[677.04] then what impression 
would it have formed.
[679.40] You are saying it like
[680.60] you didn’t tell him anything.
[683.28] Does he not know that you 
left home upset and angry?
[685.60] For God’s sake, mama,
[687.28] stop it.
[688.76] I am no longer a child.
[691.16] Hmm
[692.64] You are not a child,
[694.56] but you are surely my child
[697.16] and you can never forget this.
[699.80] And whatever I do,
[701.12] whatever I think is for 
your betterment,
[703.76] and since when did you 
starting smoking a pod?
[709.20] Okay, I am sorry.
[712.16] But you promise me,
[714.60] you will change your decision.
[718.72] Salman, right now,
[720.36] I am not in the mood
 to hear anything.
[722.56] First we will go home,
[723.40] then we will talk over there.
[748.48] Bring our bill.
[750.20] Bring it in a little while.
[751.92] Your bill has been paid, madam.
[754.60] It has been paid? Who paid it?
[758.12] That sir paid your bill.
[775.12] I was not like this earlier.
[777.08] I would stay lost in my own world.
[780.32] But then someone came in my life,
[782.52] they made me realize that
[785.28] life is not what I used to think.
[788.96] In fact, life is really different.
[792.32] And today on this occasion,
[794.76] I just want to say to 
that person, that,
[798.16] thanks
[799.52] for coming in my life
[802.60] and making my life beautiful.
[809.92] I like your daughter.
[812.56] I have come with a proposal for her.
[816.48] If you people don’t have
 an objection, then.
[828.04] I am really hungry today.
[829.12] I am so hungry,
[832.08] let’s order something.
[833.20] Hello?
[835.60] Where are you lost?
[836.60] I am talking to you.
[842.60] What happened?
[844.16] I am really hungry Urooj,
[845.12] let’s order something.
[849.36] I have lost my appetite.
[851.44] Please don’t tell me any 
bad news, right now.
[855.28] But it is not that good either.
[857.00] Okay tell me, what happened?
[863.76] He had come home
[865.64] with a wedding proposal.
[868.52] Who?
[870.84] The one who is after me.
[872.64] Salman.
[875.04] Oh my God, so romantic.
[878.88] Who else came with him?
[881.40] He was alone.
[883.48] What happened then?
[886.24] I dragged him out of the home.
[890.12] Urooj, how rude.
[892.76] Why did you drag him out?
[894.96] Don’t be so stupid.
[898.16] Him coming along was 
really insulting for me.
[903.48] Urooj,
[904.76] you didn’t do the right thing.
[909.80] I am really hungry,
[911.16] order something.
[912.48] You order.
[915.36] Waiter.
[938.04] Have tea.
[941.84] Amazing, wife of mine.
[943.52] I really wanted to have it.
[946.48] I was making it for myself,
[948.20] so I thought I would 
make it for you too.
[951.52] Thank you.
[954.88] I wanted to talk to you
 about something.
[959.88] Go ahead.
[961.88] That day, the boy who
 came for Urooj.
[967.88] I really liked him a lot.
[970.32] Yes, nothing was bad about 
him on the face of it.
[974.20] He is from an affluent home.
[976.24] Yes, he was from a good home.
[978.64] What do you want to say?
[981.24] But Urooj didn’t do good 
insulting him.
[987.56] that’s the difference,
[989.68] Urooj felt that him coming
 over was insulting for us.
[994.00] Why do you always 
negate what I say?
[1000.28] Okay fine,
[1002.00] tell me clearly what
 you want to say?
[1005.40] I want to say that,
[1007.76] the boy was really good.
[1013.40] I have always wished that
[1016.88] I get a proposal from such an 
affluent home for my Urooj.
[1023.36] Yes, but not like this.
[1026.52] If he would have come
 with his elders,
[1029.32] then we would have 
surely thought about this.
[1035.04] Urooj hasn’t come till now.
[1036.68] Where is she?
[1038.76] She must be on her way.
[1096.96] You are not having anything.
[1098.56] Yes.
[1099.88] Okay.
[1103.72] Did the mother and 
son make truce?
[1107.72] Why would us mother and 
son fight brother Idrees.
[1110.60] Salman is still young, so
[1113.84] he doesn’t understand a few things.
[1118.24] You are his mother,
[1119.52] who can think better of 
what is good and bad for him.
[1122.28] That’s what I make Salman 
understand that
[1126.56] he wouldn’t know the difference 
between good and bad.
[1130.88] I will bring a girl I like as
 a bride for Salman,
[1137.08] he will praise me all his life.
[1141.64] That is correct.
[1149.60] For God’s sake, please,
[1154.32] stop it you people.
[1157.96] If I am not saying anything,
[1159.16] this doesn’t mean, 
I will agree to you.
[1163.48] Urooj…
[1166.80] yes her name is Urooj.
[1170.04] I really love her
[1172.96] and I will marry her as well.
[1180.52] And this is my final decision.
[1195.28] If she doesn’t understand,
[1196.24] then at least you understand.
[1199.12] This will never happen.
[1205.00] Finish your breakfast.
[1206.36] No, I am fine.
[1209.68] Hey, you can do what you want,
[1211.12] but I want no issues in this home.
[1212.88] We expect good from you.
[1214.80] Okay?
[1257.76] Urooj.
[1260.92] Urooj is a really pretty name,
[1265.12] and I am sure
[1266.88] your choice must also 
be really good.
[1271.72] But son, what stupidity 
did you do?
[1274.52] You went alone to their 
home with your proposal.
[1281.40] I made a big mistake.
[1285.44] After mama’s refusal,
[1289.80] I took the proposal myself.
[1294.40] You tell me yourself,
[1296.12] will anyone marry their 
daughter to such a man
[1299.96] who brings his own proposal?
[1305.48] Okay tell me something,
[1307.60] if some elder from this home
 takes the proposal,
[1311.16] then will those people say yes?
[1314.36] They surely will.
[1316.76] They are a really good 
and decent family.
[1319.80] Hmmm
[1323.20] Does she like you too?
[1336.40] Yes. Maybe.
[1342.28] Then, done.
[1343.80] I will go with my son’s
 proposal myself.
[1346.96] In fact, we will go today.
[1349.32] You will go?
[1351.68] Thank you so much.
[1360.08] How can you go sister-in-law?
[1363.80] Why?
[1365.88] Am I not the elder of this home?
[1368.20] You are surely the elder of
 this home, sister-in-law,
[1370.64] but I am Salman’s mother
[1373.40] and with me there,
[1374.48] it is not possible that someone
 else takes my son’s proposal,
[1379.00] so you don’t bother,
[1383.32] I will take my son’s 
proposal myself.
[1393.48] Salman,
[1396.12] you make preparations,
[1398.00] we will go today with the proposal.
[1432.80] Sister-in-law Shaista
[1435.12] doesn’t let go of any opportunity
[1438.88] where she doesn’t compete 
my love for Salman.
[1446.68] I cannot let sister-in-law Shaista 
take my son’s proposal at any cost.
[1454.96] I will fulfill every wish, every
 need of Salman.
[1461.56] Whether I like it or not.
[1467.84] Salman,
[1470.36] I have become helpless
 because of you,
[1474.36] but that girl will come and
 live with me, right?
[1481.00] I will see,
[1483.64] how she snatches you 
from me with her love.
[1519.92] This…
[1523.08] where did you bring me?
[1526.56] Mom, Urooj lives here.
[1530.28] Hmmm.
[1533.00] Come on.
[1534.64] Yes, come on.
[1566.56] Come.
[1621.52] My son doesn’t lack anything,
[1624.48] he is the only son.
[1627.40] Our daughter doesn’t
 lack anything either.
[1630.24] She is also the only child.
[1632.08] Think that our child 
is our entire world
[1635.44] and she is also really beloved.
[1638.04] That’s good.
[1640.20] Your daughter is your beloved.
[1642.84] My son is my beloved.
[1647.04] I came here to ask for the 
proposal of two beloveds.
[1652.08] I didn’t come here to look at Urooj,
[1656.72] but in fact to ask for her hand.
[1663.32] Greetings.
[1664.76] Greetings.
[1671.16] She is my son’s choice,
[1673.16] so that’s it,
[1675.36] I too like her.
[1683.28] You seem like a soft spoken woman.
[1690.08] Surely your daughter will soft spoken.
[1697.96] Often blood shows its true colours.
[1703.92] Yes.
[1705.52] That’s how I have brought her up.
[1708.76] After all,
[1710.20] our Urooj is really intelligent.
[1715.60] But I believe that
[1720.36] blood always wins in 
front of upbringing.
[1725.12] Blood always shows 
its true colours.
[1736.60] Usually daughters take 
up after their mothers.
[1745.28] Anyway, leave it,
[1747.48] I want to make Urooj my daughter-in-law
 as soon as possible.
[1765.72] You people tell me your will.
[1770.92] Look sister,
[1772.36] our daughter has to get married
[1775.64] and we will not be able to make 
a decision without asking Urooj.
[1781.76] That’s good,
[1783.88] you people surely know her will.
[1787.08] I will wait for the decision of you people.
[1790.52] I just want to get this marriage done soon.
[1849.76] I want to make Urooj my daughter-in-law 
as soon as possible.
[1887.96] If you ask me honestly,
[1890.00] I liked this boy at first sight.
[1894.00] Where do you find such boys?
[1897.44] And I really liked his mother a lot.
[1905.08] Urooj, she talks so nicely.
[1914.20] Why are you telling me all this?
[1918.76] Okay, fine,
[1921.12] we will not talk about this.
[1923.32] No, no,
[1926.48] I didn’t say that either.
[1928.48] Okay,
[1930.68] so then let’s talk about this.
[1945.00] Child, tell me,
[1947.60] what do you say about this?
[1950.72] Should your papa and I say yes?
[1959.28] As you wish, mama.
[1964.12] I have left my life’s 
decision on you.
[1969.56] Yes,
[1970.80] but this is an important 
decision of your life,
[1975.12] and we don’t want it to 
happen without your will.
[1979.80] You like Salman, right?
[2003.84] You say yes.
[2013.80] She felt shy.
[2015.80] She is crazy.
[2017.48] Oh God, thank you.
[2021.16] Such a good proposal has 
come for my daughter,
[2024.96] the boy is so good,
[2027.48] the family is so good.
[2029.68] That’s it.
[2031.28] Thank God,
[2032.48] may my daughter live happy
 in that home as well.
[2077.52] What are you thinking holding 
bracelet in your hands?
[2081.28] I am thinking
[2084.68] we should tell Urooj the truth,
[2091.76] that she is not our real daughter.
[2096.52] What are you saying, Naseema?
[2100.12] Hearing this Urooj will be really hurt,
[2104.16] and I don’t want to give any sorrow
 to my daughter in this happy occasion.
[2110.44] But master,
[2113.40] she will find out someday.
[2116.00] Never. Never.
[2118.76] We will take secret of Urooj that
[2120.16] she is not our daughter to our grave.
[2128.20] Why did you think of this?
[2130.56] Just like that.
[2133.48] Now it is time for her to go 
to someone else’s home.
[2140.32] Master, the gift God gave 
us in our childless life,
[2149.08] it is time for that gift to depart.
[2153.68] Master, when we had 
found her yesterday,
[2158.72] it seems as though 
it was just yesterday.
[2177.44] Master, stop the car.
[2180.92] Stop the car, master.
[2182.00] What happened?
[2183.88] I can hear a child cry.
[2186.44] Huh?
[2189.40] Hey, no,
[2190.76] you must be hearing things.
[2192.20] Hear it carefully, I can hear it.
[2198.28] Yes, Naseema, I can hear it.
[2201.88] You wait,
[2204.56] I will go and see.
[2209.80] Okay, you stay here.
