I have put all my property, this home, the entire business in Areej’s name. Sir, the doctor is calling you. I will come. 
Okay. Come on. 
Come. Nurse. 
Yes? It is a big shock for your family. All hell broke loose on us. Mr. Idrees, when Mr. Waqar was
brought to our hospital, he was already dead. There is a small formality, 
you please sign here. Be strong Mr. Idrees. I am so sorry, mama. I don’t even have the words that I tell you to be strong. Who has given such a big sorrow, He will give us courage too. Without a doubt. How are you, Shaista? I am fine, I just have a little pain. Mama, how is Mehreen? She is still in the ICU. Just pray that she gets fine soon. Wasai. Yes, madam? Where is Salman? You don’t worry about little master, he is downstairs with Rehman baba. Mama, what do the doctors say? Idrees told me that we cannot say anything till 
she regains consciousness. Madam. Thank you, Wasai. Mama, is Mehreen badly injured? Yes, just pray that she regains 
consciousness. and Areej? Did you find out anything about her? No, not till now. Everyone is searching for her. I pray to God that wherever 
my daughter is, she is fine. Do one thing, check this entire area, no matter 
how deep the hole is, you have to look there too. No home, no place should 
go unsearched. I will surely find a clue from here. The whole area. 
Take all the men. Come on, Akbar. Come on. 
Come on. Come quickly. Come on. Inform me immediately. Hello. Hashim listen to me carefully. I am unable to get in touch 
with the manager. I have spoken to the IG, you tell the manager to contact the IG. Fine, sir, don’t worry. I have spoken to the IG and 
I am present at the accident sight. But Hashim, there should be nothing 
lacking in search for Areej. Sir, don’t worry, I will be with the police at every step. We are reaching with Waqar’s 
dead body shortly. Okay sir. May God give you patience and 
increase the levels of Mr. Waqar. Amen. Amen. Fine, goodbye. I don’t see any other wound than 
that on the head, but the patient is unconscious, 
this is something worrisome. Sir, in how long do such patients 
regain consciousness. At any time or never. Look, the whole thing is that 
you are worrying a lot, you pray to God. I have full hopes the child will be found.
don’t worry. Look, I don’t think so. The child was really young, and she might have fell from the mothers arms 
and she didn’t even survive. No, no, you are wrong. As per my investigation, 
madam didn’t get hurt so badly, and it is possible that 
the child is safe. Sir. Sir, I couldn’t find anything 
about the child. But I found this blanket from 
the shrubs at the back. Keep it in the bag. 
Sure. We will make the family identify it. Okay. 
Go. But sir, if this blanket belongs to the child,
then where is the child? Look, the investigation is 
ongoing right now, the case has not been solved. Don’t worry, pray, all will be fine. And you will see it is really late at night. I think it will be much better if we do 
our investigation in the day tomorrow. Fine, sir. As you wish. Come on. Waqar. My son. What happened to my son? No, let me see. Let me see my son. 
Let me see. Oh God, what happened?
My son. Let me see my son. 
He left me and went. Oh God, what has happened. What has happened to my son? You know, it is no less of a miracle for you
and Mehreen to survive such a big accident. You are right. God was kind and 
the two of us survived or else the accident was bad. How is Mehreen now? She got injuries on the head, and some wounds too but she still hasn’t regained 
consciousness. Did you find out about the child? No, nothing till now. Now 24 hours have passed. God knows, till now some animal 
must have eaten her. Shaista, what are you saying? Say something good. God knows what condition my innocent 
daughter will be in. If God wills, she will come home safe. Yes. Yes. She talks nonsense. You will find her if she is alive. Miss Mehreen Miss Mehreen can you hear me? Miss Mehreen. It is a good sign that she can feel. Sir, the SHO is here to meet you. Okay, thank you. Okay, I will talk to you. 
Greetings Mr. Idrees, how are you? Are you fine? Come to the office. Come  on. Have a seat. Thank you. Yes? Mr. Idrees, I want to tell you that the DIG inquires 
from me about this every day and I am putting in my full effort. I am surprised where the child went. There is no clue other than the blanket. Sir, there are two villages on 
either side of the road, and I have searched every single home, but we cannot find anything. You tell me, we will publish an ad 
in the newspaper along with prize money. Sir, I had thought about it, but then I thought you are 
a big businessman, what if you don’t find it reasonable. No, no, nothing like that, we have to 
search for the child at all costs. Fine, sir. Yes, Mr. Hashmi, the SHO has advised that we give an ad 
for Areej being lost in the newspaper. Yes, I will email you the pictures. Yes, you work on it. Okay. How are you, mama? I am fine, child. Tell me, what is the update on Areej? The police is trying its best. 
God will be kind. My happy and content home got
the evil eye. My son left me and went, God knows where my granddaughter is, what condition she is in? And the poor daughter-in-law is 
unconscious in the hospital. Mama, Areej will be found and also Mehreen will be fine, you just pray. I have been praying for all these days. Salman. Salman. Salman. Salman. Salman. Salman. Madam Mehreen, 
how do you feel now? Where is my Salman? Call him.
 Call Salman. Salman is here. 
Call him. What are we doing here? I want to go from here.
Call Salman. Note the blood pressure, also note the patient, everyone. Don’t worry, you are with us here. You had a minor accident. Minor? I had a really bad accident, Salman was in my lap. Call him. 
Call him. But no one from the injured was Salman. Salman was not in the car… Okay tell me, who was driving? My husband, Waqar. Waqar was driving. Mehreen, Waqar left us and went. He left? Where did he go? Waqar is not in this world. My son has left, Mehreen. Waqar. Waqar. Call Waqar. Call Waqar. Call him. Please, you two go out. 
Bring her mask quickly. Yes, madam Mehreen has regained 
consciousness again, but… But what doctor? I had a doubt about this earlier. Actually, the thing is her memory has
stopped at a particular time, and she remembers a few things, 
and she has forgotten a few things. Maybe this is why she doesn’t remember 
this accident, this shock. So, the condition Mehreen was 
in right now, what was all that? I am trying to explain 
the same thing to you, if she goes through the same 
shock again, then her condition will be the same as 
it is right now. But doctor, what will be the result of 
this condition Mehreen is in. She can lose her memory forever, she can have a brain hemorrhage 
or she can even lose her life. So doctor, what will we have to do? Don’t try to remind her of anything. By the way, who is Salman, 
who she is constantly calling her son? He is not Mehreen’s son, he is my son. But Mehreen is calling her, her son. If the situation is such, then everyone will have to accept 
whatever she thinks as the truth, and all this is really necessary 
for her life. Doctor, does Mehreen only remember this or does she also remember 
her daughter, Areej? She doesn’t remember anything 
other than Salman, but Mr. Waqar is still in her memory a little. Apart from this, she doesn’t remember 
anything and my advice would be don’t even 
try to remind her of anything. This will be good for her life. Thank you. What condition is my daughter in? She is saying incomplete things, 
completely lost. She remembers something,
she doesn’t remember something. God, please give Mehreen health soon. Sit, Mr. Hashim. Sir, you joined the office? You should have rested for some time. I realize the intensity of your shock. Yes, Hashim, the sorrow is big but life doesn’t stop. I also have to look at this business too. That is true. Sir, we had to shift some things, 
the work of parties are stopping. You do one thing, tell the IT to shift 
my computer system to Waqar’s room. Sir, will you sit in Mr. Waqar’s room? Yes, when I have to take care 
of Waqar’s work after him, then it is also necessary 
for me to sit there too. Fine, sir, then I will ask the IT and shift 
your system there. Okay?
Fine, sir. Sir, you are going to sit in 
Mr. Waqar’s room? Yes, when I am taking care of 
all of Waqar’s room, I want that I sit in this room Sir, that is fine, but… Do you want to say something? Yes, sir. 
Go ahead. Go ahead. Sir, as per company rules you cannot 
sit in Mr. Waqar’s place like this. What does this mean? I am the most senior after 
Waqar in this company. You are sir, but the company has a process and everything will be done 
as per the process. What process? Who will do it? The company has board of directors and we will have to seek permission 
from the head of the board of directors Waqar was the head of this board, now he is no more, so who will 
give the confirmation? Sir, Mrs. Waqar. After Mr. Waqar, she is now the head 
of the board of directors of the company. Fine. How was your first day in the office
 after Waqar? There was a lot of work. Waqar used to work his way, 
I work my way. Obviously, Waqar used to work in his style, 
but you work with experience. But to work independently, 
I will the rights that Waqar had. Yes, that is automatically yours 
after Waqar’s death, right? No, it is not like that, Shaista, the board directors decide this 
or the head of the board. and who is the head of the board? After Waqar, the head of the board 
is Mehreen. If she signs, then I will automatically 
get the rights. Fine, you don’t worry. Mehreen is anyway, 
mentally handicapped. How hard is it to make her sign it? I will make her sign it. Really? Is that so? Wait. Then here you go, the letter is in this file. You have a look at it, meanwhile
I will meet mama. Mama, I will massage your feet. Hey no, son, I am fine. Shaista was telling me you went 
to the office today. Yes, mama, I have joined the office. Son, after Waqar left the entire responsibility
is on you. You just pray I am able to handle it. Why not? I am sure you will take care 
of everything well. Now you too must be tired, go and rest. Sure, mama. As you all are aware, Mr. Waqar is not in the world anymore, so all the responsibility of this company 
is being given to Mr. Idrees. You people please don’t clap. I didn’t take this responsibility happily, in fact, I did it out of helplessness, and I want that I fulfill all these 
responsibilities along with you. Sir, don’t worry, we are with you. Thank you. Thank you. That’s what 
I expected from you people and I will also need your help 
on every step going forward. Where is my Salman? I am here. Okay, you are here. I am here. Salman. What? 
Where are you? I am here. Oh, you caught me. Salman, where did you go? Today my Mehreen is so happy. Mama, I always happy with my Salman, only if Waqar was here… so he too would have been 
really happy to see us too. But I don’t know why, Waqar got a little unwell and 
he left us and went. Mama, I am bored.
Come on. Yes, we will play. 
Come on. Mama, cheating. 
Close your eyes. Okay, I won’t cheat. 
Here you go. Is it done? You go. 
Where are you? Mama, I am here. 
I am here. My child is so unlucky, she considers someone 
else’s child her own. God knows where her daughter would be? What condition would she be in? Sit. I called you people to talk about 
something important. Yes, mama, order us. Mehreen thinks Salman is her son. She always thinks that. Earlier, she used to say 
that Salman is her son, but now we will say that 
Salman is Mehreen’s son Mama, what does this mean? This means that no one will make Mehreen realize 
that Salman is not her son. And yes, no one will mention Waqar and Areej 
in front of Mehreen, this is my decision. Yes mama, as you order. Did you hear me too, Wasai? Yes. Yes. Mama, as you order. This is the matter of our Mehreen’s life. Mama, what will happen about 
Mehreen’s mourning? What do you mean, Shaista? Mehreen is in her home, so obviously, she will complete her 
mourning here. You are the limit, Shaista. These are the papers of all of 
Mr. Waqar Ahmad’s wealth and ownership of his business, and according to it, 
the owner of all her things is Mr. Waqar’s widow, Mehreen 
and her daughter Areej. What are you saying, Mr. Lawyer’? everything has been put in Menreen and Areej’s name? No, no, this is not possible. But, these papers were mad on 
Mr. Waqar’s directive, and Mr. Idrees knows I am 
the legal advisor of the company, so madam, these were 
an entrustment with me. I would want that madam 
you take care of it. I needed my son in this age, and he left me and went. Have patience, mama. Have patience.
