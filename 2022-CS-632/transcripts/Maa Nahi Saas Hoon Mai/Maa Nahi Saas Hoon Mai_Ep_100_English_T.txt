[20.73] This mask of deceit and fraud 
that you people had on your face
[24.07] it has been removed. 
Enough!
[27.60] Stop your nonsense.
[34.47] You are calling us cheaters?
[39.73] There is no need to argue, Arooj.
[41.73] You leave from this home, 
don’t blow this out of proportions.
[45.17] You have blown it 
out of proportions.
[47.70] Now the matter will end.
[49.77] I am ending this matter.
[51.93] Hah,
[53.13] you had the right to 
start the matter,
[60.23] but not to end it.
[62.13] I will end it!
[69.20] Look, child, 
how she is misbehaving…
[71.07] Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future.
[74.60] Look here. 
Salman. Salman.
[80.53] Do you have no manners 
to talk?
[83.30] I will drag you out…
Salman. Salman, no.
[85.80] Leave me, papa. 
No.
[87.23] Why are you stopping him?
[88.83] What will you do with me?
Huh?
[94.20] Why did you stop?
[95.63] What do you think?
[97.00] I will get scared of 
this action of yours?
[99.67] No, elder madam,
[101.50] you are not well. 
You come with me.
[106.13] I am not afraid of anyone.
[107.97] All of you hear me carefully.
[110.10] Stop your nonsense.
[112.30] I will throw you out of this home 
right now.
[114.47] This is me and my mother’s home.
[127.30] No one can drag us out of here.
[129.63] Do you people understand?
[131.23] Hear me out clearly.
[133.47] This is me and my mother’s home.
[137.07] Leave me, we will see how 
you people don’t go from here.
[141.17] Salman, leave it.
[207.17] Why are you thinking this?
[210.43] And why are you afraid
of these people?
[212.37] No,
[215.17] I am not afraid.
[221.67] I just don’t want to live here.
[226.50] I don’t want any form of chaos.
[229.50] Mama, this is our home,
[231.27] we own all this and this is 
what these people want.
[236.90] I don’t want anything, Arooj.
[239.27] You are with me and
this is enough for me.
[243.47] Trust me,
[245.53] I am with you,
[247.73] but these people cannot do
anything to us.
[250.27] Fine, then,
[252.37] when you are with me, 
everything is fine.
[255.90] I just don’t want to live 
with these people.
[259.13] Listen to me.
[261.77] Look, child,
[264.00] you should listen to 
what your mother says.
[269.63] You don’t upset a mother.
[272.70] How can I upset you, mama?
[279.23] I am just trying to make 
you understand,
[281.97] these people cannot 
do anything to us.
[284.37] Arooj,
[286.10] don’t insist, child.
[295.07] For my sake.
[326.07] As you wish.
[436.80] Son, I am telling you,
[440.30] this girl will not go from here 
so easily.
[444.30] How will she not go?
[452.93] Papa stopped me,
[457.47] or else you people would have 
seen what I would have done to her.
[471.23] It is better to scare, 
then hit someone, Salman.
[476.03] You people don’t know, Arooj.
[486.20] She is not that weak.
[494.20] You shouldn’t have stopped me.
[498.00] Child, what has happened, 
forget about it.
[505.80] Now, think what do 
we have to do next.
[508.70] There is no need to think 
about that.
[512.33] They will have to leave this home.
[654.17] We are leaving.
[677.13] But don’t think
[681.63] that we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people.
[698.50] Mama…
[709.07] But
[733.67] I...
[737.63] will come back.
[765.03] I will surely come.
[776.87] This is my promise to all of you.
[850.63] Shall we go, mama?
[968.53] Why are you crying now?
[971.50] We left the home on your insistence.
[978.33] I am really disappointed
[984.23] the way we left this home.
[991.03] I spent such a long time over there.
[996.70] I saw so many seasons of happiness 
and sorrow there.
[1004.43] We had to leave my Waqar’s home 
like strangers.
[1018.00] How is our sorrow, mama?
[1021.37] Is your husband’s house
the same as mine.
[1031.83] That is not Salman’s house.
[1035.47] Right now, he is living there.
[1039.20] Very soon, everything will get better.
[1045.70] It is impossible.
[1047.73] When I can find you,
after twenty-five years.
[1053.20] When this is possible,
[1055.97] then anything is possible.
[1066.13] I can understand your sorrow.
[1071.73] I have stayed in that house 
for a little while.
[1075.63] But you have spent a time there.
[1078.63] You got married and 
came to that house.
[1080.97] You saw a lot in that house.
[1087.70] I never wanted that 
you leave that house.
[1091.50] But I gave up in front 
of your insistence.
[1097.93] I got scared.
[1101.00] I was fearful.
[1104.73] I had to do all this because of you,
because of Areej.
[1129.20] Mama,
[1131.20] look here.
[1134.87] What happened?
[1136.30] Did someone say something?
[1139.20] Tell me. What happened?
[1144.83] These people are saying,
[1148.87] that we leave from this home.
[1151.37] Who is saying all this?
[1156.50] Sister-in-law, Shaista.
[1159.80] Who is she?
[1161.67] Who is she to drag us 
out of our home?
[1168.43] I don’t know what she thinks 
of herself.
[1171.13] I will teach her a lesson today.
[1210.70] You live in such a big home 
yourself,
[1213.27] with your wife and son, 
that too happily.
[1217.30] Hey, tell me, do you want to go 
and live in that home?
[1221.33] Really? Is this possible?
[1225.13] Hey, is it possible?
[1227.27] My wife, this is going to happen, 
it is just matter of a few days.
[1230.97] I don’t understand anything.
[1233.17] Hey, I told you, I am coming 
after meeting the lawyer.
[1236.53] Shaista and Salman think that
I made the papers in Salman’s name.
[1242.50] Then?
[1243.53] No one will find out,
[1245.43] as soon as Arooj signs, 
everything will be in my name.
[1248.83] That’s it, then I will leave Shaista.
[1250.93] I have had enough of her. 
She has grown old.
[1254.60] I know that and after all,
[1258.60] I am in your life.
[1261.40] Yes, that is true.
[1264.00] Hey, I have to reach the office.
[1266.10] I have to make sure Salman doesn’t 
talk to the lawyer directly at any cost
[1269.50] or else the secret will be out.
[1282.03] Wasai.
[1287.73] Yes, madam.
[1289.87] Come here.
[1293.07] Come near me.
[1296.83] Go and tell the guard outside,
[1299.07] that madam has ordered
[1302.07] that those two shouldn’t 
step in this home.
[1305.43] Okay?
[1321.43] Wasai,
[1324.20] did you not understand me?
[1327.97] Yes.
[1329.23] Then go tell him.
[1332.57] Go.
[1355.77] You are really happy.
[1359.30] Why should I not be happy?
[1361.40] The thorn has been removed.
[1369.43] And the thorn that was pinching me
 in my heart.
[1377.47] I have now found peace.
[1382.07] Your plan is successful.
[1384.07] Thank God it got successful.
[1387.03] Or else, I felt that
[1388.87] the entire chess game will be turned.
[1393.03] It did turn, but in our Favor.
[1396.60] Yes.
[1400.63] Now, the four of us will rule 
this entire wealth together.
[1405.83] Four? Meaning you are including Arooj?
[1409.60] Not Arooj.
[1414.70] Areej.
[1416.17] Our granddaughter.
[1422.90] Our Salman’s daughter.
[1431.50] Excuse me.
[1442.63] Hey, they are some 
twenty-five-year-old papers.
[1445.73] How long do you have them for?
[1447.23] For twenty-five years.
[1449.40] When Waqar had put everything 
in Areej’s name,
[1452.77] that’s the day I took out this file 
from the cupboard.
[1457.50] You plan for the future, Shaista.
[1459.90] You knew we would need them 
one day.
[1462.83] I had kept all this safe.
[1465.10] If you were there, we would have been 
living in a cottage instead of this home.
[1468.67] No, that is not true.
[1470.87] What do we have to do about these?
[1472.10] You have to give these papers 
to the lawyer.
[1475.00] He will redo them.
[1476.77] I have spoken to Salman,
[1478.77] he will coax Arooj and 
get her to sign it,
[1482.07] and also give her thumb impression.
[1484.60] You made a great plan. 
I will talk to the lawyer today.
[1487.87] You have to do it today.
[1489.27] You know about Salman’s mood;
[1491.03] it can change at any time.
[1492.30] If he gets angry at something in future,
then everything will be ruined.
[1496.60] Got it?
[1520.53] You are a liar.
[1523.20] Not just a liar,
[1524.90] in fact, you can fake love too.
[1526.77] Arooj.
[1527.67] Lower your voice.
[1531.60] You faked your love to me;
[1535.33] you made a fake apology to mama
[1537.83] and now,
[1540.20] you will give your life 
for your daughter?
[1543.63] I am sure you are lying about this.
[1548.23] What did you think?
[1549.67] Did you think I will not 
find out anything?
[1554.23] I have read all those papers Salman.
[1565.07] What will you do, huh?
[1568.40] What will you do with this wealth?
[1572.80] Is all this more precious 
than selfless love?
[1607.87] God be kind,
[1610.03] what is the sound of that breaking?
[1626.93] Look, child, how she is misbehaving…
[1629.20] Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future.
[1632.40] Look here. 
Salman. Salman.
[1634.60] Do you have no manners to talk?
[1637.57] I will drag you out…
Salman. Salman, no.
[1640.03] Leave me, papa. 
No.
[1641.17] Why are you stopping him?
[1642.97] What will you do with me?
Huh?
[1646.83] Why did you stop? 
What do you think?
[1649.40] I will get scared of this action 
of yours?
[1654.83] I am not afraid of anyone.
[1656.73] All of you hear me carefully.
[1658.53] Stop your nonsense.
[1660.80] I will throw you out of 
this home right now.
[1663.07] This is me and my mother’s home.
[1671.40] No one can drag us out of here.
[1673.80] Do you people understand?
Hear me out clearly.
[1677.33] This is me and my mother’s home.
[1724.37] We are leaving.
[1729.83] But don’t think
[1734.20] that we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people.
[1739.87] Mama…
[1747.90] But
[1759.47] I...
[1763.23] will come back.
[1771.20] I will surely come.
[1776.47] This is my promise to all of you.
[1811.70] Wasai.
[1814.47] Wasai.
[1874.77] This woman doesn’t listen.
[1878.27] Yes, madam.
[1880.20] What is breaking upstairs?
[1883.30] Little master,
[1886.27] broke his picture with younger madam.
[1899.17] Fine, leave.
[1906.80] My Salman,
[1909.33] came to me before going 
to the office today.
[1914.43] So, what can I do?
[1917.90] You did what you had to do.
[1922.33] The hatred you had put in Salman’s 
mind towards me and Arooj,
[1928.03] it has ended now.
[1932.93] He has found out,
[1935.20] who actually loves him.
[1943.20] What is the matter sister-in-law, 
Shaista?
[1945.77] You are not saying anything.
[1950.63] Okay fine,
[1952.73] I will see Salman as well.
[1955.00] You can see him.
[1957.37] You should surely see him, when 
my Salman will be with me.
[1963.67] Surely see him.
[1970.70] Aunt,
[1973.07] I just got a question in my mind,
[1977.07] why do you get so uncomfortable 
seeing Salman and his mother’s love?
[1992.17] Now see,
[1994.67] that’s how the love of a mother 
and son is like.
[2004.20] Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
[2010.67] But what would you know?
[2014.17] You have no child of your own.
[2021.47] I feel
[2025.00] you want to say something.
[2031.70] Good.
[2038.73] This means that Salman wants 
to get rid of everything
[2045.13] attached to Arooj.
[2049.73] Then fine,
[2054.17] if he wants this,
[2061.37] then, I will surely help him.
