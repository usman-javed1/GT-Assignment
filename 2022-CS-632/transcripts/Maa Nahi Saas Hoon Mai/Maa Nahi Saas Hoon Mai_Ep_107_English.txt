You pushed my father? 
Huh? You pushed him? Push me.
Hit me. Why don’t you hit me? What do you think of yourself? What is this arrogance for? Respect. 
Fame. Why are you quiet? 
Speak up. Lower your voice. This is my home, you are not allowed to 
talk loudly here. I will talk loudly. And what is this home 
you are talking about? Two minutes. The ground from under your feet
will be pulled, in two minutes. Areej. Areej. You cannot take Areej. You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother. I will stop you.
Leave me. Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it. Leave it… When you cannot handle the bike, then why do you bring it 
on the road at this age? Do you see, 
you put a dent in my car? You are right, Salman. It is my fault. You want to embarrass me 
by saying all this, right? Like it is all my fault and you didn’t 
do anything. That’s how it is, right? No, there is nothing like that,
I came to talk to you. When I have told you that 
I don’t want to talk to you, then why are you after me 
like a beggar? Go from here. You are right, the father of the girl is a beggar 
in front of a rich son in law. Don’t speak too many dialogues 
in front of me. Guards, pick up his bike and 
take it into custody. Till the time he doesn’t pay up,
he will not get his bike. No, no, Salman,
 don’t do this. Stop them. Hey, 
where are you taking it. Salman. Stop them, 
Salman. Where are they taking my bike?
Salman. Salman, don’t do this.
Look… What happened? Why did you stop? Hit me. I would have surely hit you, if the mark from last night’s slap
hadn’t left your face. Why did you come here? And I knew you would do this. That’s why I followed you 
and came here. Who told you to come here? Child, I wanted to talk to Salman. Hah, there is no benefit of banging 
your head on the walls, papa. Come on, papa. Come on, guards. Miss Muqadas, 
did Mr. Salman come? No sir, he is not here yet. Fine, when he comes 
give him this file. Okay, sir. Miss Dua, how are you? Fine, sir. Do you feel the weird environment
of the office, or am I the only one who feels it? Yes, sir, it is not like earlier. Even boss is not coming. The files are piled up on the table. Even Mr. Salman comes 
for a little while, and he keeps on sitting 
in a weird state. Yes, sir. 
Do you know? Yesterday, sir called me in the office,
and scolded me so much. He said I have ordered coffee 
for so long, it is still not here. I stayed completely quiet. Three coffee cups were kept 
on the side table, sir didn’t touch a single cup. I am not getting good vibes. Anyway, God is great. Miss Muqadas look at this. Is everything okay? Why are you walking like this?
I am fine. I am fine. Where did you go? I went to meet Salman. To meet Salman? Why? To talk about your issue. I told him to save his home
from being ruined. Then? Then what did he say? He cursed me. And he pushed me down. Sit down comfortably. You two went separately, but you both came together. Because the two of us went 
to the same place. Where did you people go? Papa should answer this, but I will tell you where we went. He was going to Salman’s office and I had an idea, 
he would go there, that is why I followed him there. What is wrong with you? Why did you go there? What did Salman do? He did what he had done 
earlier as well. In fact, maybe this time he did something 
even more dangerous. God be kind. What did Salman do? He hit papa’s motorcycle 
with his car. Thank God, no big accident occurred. Hey, he didn’t hit it on purpose. It was just a coincidence. Papa, why don’t you say it, that he tried to kill you. Arooj is right. Salman is crazy, he can do anything. Hey, all of you people 
get on one side. My opinion has no importance. Listen to me. 
He is a good boy. Just Idrees and Shaista have
 driven him mad. He is not a child, papa. He is a well-known 
businessman of the city; he cannot be misled by anyone. Whatever he did, 
he did in his senses. I am surprised, Master, so much happened but 
you are still mistaken. I am not mistaken, Naseema. You will see, Salman will come one day and take his Arooj. May God bless us with 
what you are saying. But I don’t think this will happen. Salman is a stonehearted man, just like his mother. Hey, no sister Mehreen, I didn’t mean you. I was talking about sister Shaista. I am his mother. But he is not like me at all. It's uncertain whether the mother is the one
who gives birth or the one who raises the child. Which statement is true? I don’t understand. You are fine, right? Did you get hurt? Hey, no Naseema, the car hit the bike, I remained safe. Nothing happened to me. Thank God. I will bring water for you. 
Go, bring water. When you cannot handle the bike, then why do you bring it 
on the road at this age? Do you see,
 you put a dent in my car? You are right, Salman. It is my fault. You want to embarrass me 
by saying all this, right? Like it is all my fault and you didn’t 
do anything. That’s how it is, right? No, there is nothing like that, 
I came to talk to you. When I have told you that 
I don’t want to talk to you, then why are you after me
like a beggar? Go from here. You are right, the father of the girl is a beggar 
in front of a rich son in law. Don’t speak too many dialogues 
in front of me. Guards, pick up his bike and 
take it into custody. Till the time he doesn’t pay up, 
he will not get his bike. Keep my coat in my room. 
Fine, sir. Hello, son. 
How are you? He survived again. Who? The same, master Shoaib. He came to my office today. I hit his bike with my car. Then? Then, what? The old man survived. Salman, what are you doing, son? Don’t do this. This way, you will be in trouble. For God’s sake, mom, it was a small accident, 
what else? After all, I am tired of this family. Until I erase them from existence, I will not find peace. When a person comes home, you ask how they are. You don’t start questioning them. You have come really late, 
that’s only why I am asking. I am not a school going child, that I go on time and 
come back on time. I am a businessman, people know me as Salman. No one knows me as your son. But nowadays you don’t go
to the office, right? Why do you ask? I am your mother, that is why
I am asking. Ask me questions that match the type of 
mother you are. Naseema, I fear that all my efforts
 may go in vain. All your efforts have become 
useless, Master. This matter will not be resolved the way you are thinking. Yes, I have an idea. But that fear doesn’t leave my heart. If we sit quietly being fearful, then we will not be able to do 
anything for Arooj. If Arooj finds everything and 
loses her relation with Salman, then it will be a terrible deal. This relation is between them; it cannot be saved with 
one person’s sacrifice. Master, Salman has forgotten that there is some Arooj 
in his life. When Salman’s eyes will be opened,
he will find out, that his parents sacrificed his wife
and daughter because of their greed. We will have to sort this matter
before that time comes. So that Salman too gets a chance
to understand the truth. Look, this is a matter of Arooj’s life and Mehreen is her mother, ask her once again. I have already asked her and she too wants legal action 
to be taken. And she wants that her daughter 
gets her, right. Fine. Let’s do it. I will talk to the lawyer. I have ruined it? How dare you say something 
so useless to me? Actually, Areej is also with you, so Arooj is crying continuously. Have mercy on her. There is still time. Leave from here, or else I will have 
the guard drag you out. Don’t do that. My daughter will go mad. Really? So, she is your daughter? With what relation? You can say anything, but don’t separate Areej and 
Arooj from you. Please. Don’t try to dictate me. Get out of here.
