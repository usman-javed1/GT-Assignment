Mr. Judge, this is Arooj Ahmad’s DNA report. According to it, Arooj Ahmad is the daughter of 
Waqar Ahmad and madam Mehreen. Thus, there is no doubt. And along with that there is also madam
 Mehreen’s medical report as well, which clearly states that 
she is mentally fit, thus, her testimony cannot be denied and that is already 
in the court’s record. And the most important thing, there is a copy of the transfer papers for the wealth in the file you have. It is clear from it, that Waqar Ahmad transferred 
all his property to his daughter Arooj Ahmad twenty-two years back. Now I will request the honourable court, to make the decision for this case 
in favour of my client, Arooj Ahmad. You too have a seat, please. After hearing the arguments 
and evidence presented by the defendant's lawyer 
and the prosecution, in the light of all the proofs
and testimonies, this court has reached
the conclusion that the deceased Waqar Ahmad's 
daughter is indeed Arooj Ahmad. She is, in fact, the rightful owner of 
this property and all the businesses. The court declares 
the case dismissed. Court is adjourned. Naseema. Naseema. Hey. You? You still haven’t left? Hey, there is no need 
to go anywhere. Arooj called. Arooj called? Is all okay? Yes, all is okay, and I have a big good news. Congratulations, the decision has been
made in favour of our Arooj. Oh God, thank you God. See, did I not say, no matter how much 
the darkness spreads, one ray of light ends it. And our Arooj is the ray of this light. Yes, you were absolutely right. Our Arooj has gone through 
a lot of sorrow. Hey, you have to go through sorrow. God test his good servants, and when this test ends, then the oppressed gets respect and the cruel person gets humiliated. The sacrifice not only bears fruit but its yield is also very sweet. Master our Arooj has shown 
great patience. And God is with the patient. When He is with you, why do you 
need anyone else? I pray to God that our Arooj has 
happiness in her home. And may God make Salman 
better for Arooj. Amen. Hey, here you go, have sweets to celebrate 
our daughter’s success. I will first offer prayers 
of thankfulness, after that I will have sweets. You reminded me of a good thing, I will also offer prayers 
of thankfulness. I will go and perform ablution. Mama, give me the court order. Here is the court order. Now, no one should have 
a misunderstanding that I am not the owner 
of this home. Cruelty and injustice only have 
one night, and after every night,
there is a day. And that bright day only belongs
to the oppressed. Now what are you doing there 
standing and staring at us? Gather your things and 
leave from here. Mehreen, I…
Uncle, the time for forgiveness has passed. Now, the time for punishment 
has begun. Hey, you people didn’t even care
about the time that had passed. But I am giving you two 
a gift from me. Since you are going away 
from this home, so I have made arrangements 
for the two of you to stay. But, tonight, we don’t want to see any stranger’s 
face in our home at any cost. So, get out of our home! Come on, mama. Wasai, take Areej to her room and also take this file. Sure. Finally, we have come to our home. We had to come, mama. After getting tired for the whole day, you find peace at your own home. My Salman must be tired as well. He too suffered with us. Salman? He was not with us. He was not with them, either. He was just misled by a few people or else, you know Salman. Love is such a weird thing, mama. If you fall in love with someone once, we never seen any flaws of theirs. You… love? Salman? How do I answer this question? You tell me, what do you want? What do you want? The two of us… I mean, you and I, a mother and a wife. Do you understand? Yes. What did you understand? You want that Salman lives with us, that he doesn’t go anywhere. Don’t you want this? I too want this. Live long. Live long. Master, how many times will we 
send off our daughter? And after she leaves, we will miss her and cry. Arooj once again made our home 
lonely and went. Do you hear what I am saying? I heard you, Naseema. If the daughters are at their in-laws 
home it is good. So, why are you not happy? I am worried thinking 
about her in-laws. Idrees, Shaista, to the extent that Arooj’s husband
 Salman, they all oppose her. So, what sort of in-laws are they? If Arooj and sister Mehreen 
have to live together, then that makes it Arooj’s 
mother’s home. It is possible that those people don’t leave 
the home and go? This is more dangerous, and I am thinking the same. So, also explain it to me. Look, those people who are 
after Arooj, Mehreen and even that innocent soul’s life. They cannot leave everything
 so easily. Then? What will happen, then? I will not go. I will stay here. I will not go. No, all this is mine. All this is mine. This home, too. All this is mine. All this is mine. No. I won’t go from here. 
I won’t go. I have so many memories 
at this home. This is my home, no one can drag me out of here. No one can drag me out, 
all this is mine. Every thing. No one will take me out of here. All this is mine. All this belongs to Shaista. Shaista. I have ruled this home 
for so many years. Shaista. Shaista, what are you doing?
Get a grip on yourself, Shaista. How do I get a grip? Why do I get a grip? Idrees. Idrees, I cannot leave this home and go. I will not leave this home and go.
I will not leave. This is our home. I won’t go.
This belongs to Shaista. Listen to me. Listen to me. 
We will have to leave. Arooj has won the ownership 
of everything. It is the court’s order, 
try and understand. No! I don’t accept any court’s order. All this is mine, 
I am the owner. I am the owner of all these things. She will drag me out of this home? She will drag me out? Stop it, Shaista. Stop it. Don’t torture yourself like this. No. I will not torture myself. I will torture those people, who even thought about 
dragging out of this home. You don’t understand, 
we cannot do anything. You people must not be 
able to do anything, but Shaista? No one can stop Shaista. No one can stop Shaista. Shaista can do anything. That girl from yesterday will ruin my years of planning like this? No, this is not possible. This is my home. Where is this Salman?
Now Salman will come, he will control you. Shaista, what is wrong with you?
Why are you doing this? Since this girl stepped in my life, she ruined my life. She ruined my planning
for so many years. She wants to drag me out 
of my home. No. No. I won’t go from here. All this is mine. No one can drag me out of here.
I won’t leave. All this is mine. 
I won’t leave. All this is mine.
I will not go from here. Get up, Shaista.
Get up. Come on. Get up. Get up. We… we cannot do anything. I have heard it. I know you cannot do anything, but Shaista can. Now you will see, Shaista will do it. Shaista will do it. I will make this Arooj’s life 
so torturous, that even after she is alive, she will seem as though 
she is dead. I will make her suffer. She will not even get water. I will make her life a living hell. You will see. You stay here, okay? 
No one should come inside. I will go and see. Did you see? God’s stick is silent. Did Areej go to sleep? Yes, younger madam, 
really happily. Wasai, is Salman back? No, elder madam, he has not come till now. But I have told the watchman that as soon as little master comes, he should send him to you. And aunt and uncle?
Have those people left? No. They too are still in their room. I could only hear the sound 
of fighting, arguing and screaming 
from their room. Then all of a sudden 
there was silence. Areej. Wasai, come on. You, your mother and your mother’s mother snatched everything from me. You people are my enemies. You are the wound that I have to give to Mehreen 
and Arooj. Areej. Where is Areej? You people are my enemies. You people have snatched 
everything from me. That’s why you will have to die. Mama, Areej is not in the room. What? Where will she be? 
Areej. Wasai? I will drop you and kill you. Areej. Stop, what are you doing? Don’t you dare. Stay away. 
Stay away. Shaista.
Stay away. Leave her… Stay away. I will throw her down,
 I will kill her. She is innocent, 
what has she done to you? Please give her to me. You are right, she has no fault. It is her mother’s fault… it is your mother’s fault.
