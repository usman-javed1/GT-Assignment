You had lost your memory 
after that accident. The doctor had said that if you are reminded of the past, 
then your life will be in danger. That’s why, no one used to talk to 
you about anything from the past. So, if this is the reality, then what was that, that I lived for twenty five years? Can that not become part 
of this reality? So much love, so much affection, that I gave to Salman, is it not enough for me to be his mother
and he to be my son? Being the son and remaining the son has a big difference. But no one saw this difference 
till yesterday. Sister-in-law Shaista,
 said one thing, and everyone sees 
the difference now. I don’t care about anyone, but today, my Salman shattered me. He shattered a mother. Please, get a grip on yourself. Save yourself from mental suffering,
 please. The thing everyone is trying 
to make me understand, is the reason for my suffering. I am your son’s wife. If your own daughter faced 
a similar treatment, then would you have tolerated it? You gave my answer 
in your question, that you are my daughter-in-law, not my daughter. I am not your daughter, but I am like your daughter. Yes, but maybe you don’t know that there is a big difference 
between being a daughter and being like a daughter. But if you want, you can end 
this difference. What does me wanting it 
or not wanting it do? If you call me mother, then will I become your mother? No, right? Just like that you, 
you are my daughter-in-law, you can never be my daughter. What is this? You started crying while trying to take care 
of your mother. I am crying on my fate. I found my mother after so long, 
with so many tries, with so much difficulty and, when I found mama, then I am sad that she is not 
even ready to hug me. My child. What do we do? Huh? I don’t understand anything, that whether I should be sad 
about Salman leaving or should I celebrate the happiness
 of finding my daughter after so long. I don’t understand anything. I don’t understand anything. Son, Salman. Son, Salman, where were you? I was calling you for so long, you weren’t even answering your phone.
I got so worried. There is no need for you 
to get worried. How are you talking to me? I am not a child, that I will get lost somewhere. You answer me. Am I a weak child, that anyone will hand me over 
to anyone and break ties with them. No. No. No. No, son. I know what you want to say, but I had never broken ties 
with you. What is the matter son, Salman? Don’t call me your son! Salman, lower your voice, 
she is your mother… Quiet! No one will speak, and they will not lie at all. I have found out everything. I have seen my birth certificate. That is wrong. Nothing is wrong. That was not a lie. What I was shown all these years 
as the truth is the lie. I am telling you, I am not your son. And neither are you my mother. In future, don’t call me your son. Salman is thinking 
I am responsible for this. Although, both of us are innocent. How can the ones who love 
be responsible? Both of us got punished by the mercilessness of time. Salman. My son. Get a grip on yourself. Fine, I didn’t give birth to you, but you are my son. All my life, I considered myself
to be an orphan, even when my father was alive. I used to call own father, uncle. Why? Why did you do this with me? You must not have 
an answer, right? Son, we did all this for your betterment. Betterment? Is this betterment? What is the betterment is separating 
someone and living, tell me? You people made 
my entire life a lie. And he is saying this. You consider us responsible, right? Responsible? Responsible is a small word, you people are sinners. Playing with someone’s life is a sin. Son, Salman…
Don’t touch me. I am not the son of anyone 
out of the three of you. Forgive me my child. Why are you asking 
for forgiveness? I have done a lot of injustice to you. I have mistreated you a lot. You didn’t do anything. Whatever happened was done 
unknowingly and…That’s it. But as far as I can remember, I did really wrong with you. Whatever you have done, was when you were my mother-in-law. But now… now you are my mother. Should I tell you something? Yes, tell me. The day I found out 
you are my mother. From that day, no matter how much
 you would get upset with me, I would only feel love seeing you. So, why did you not tell me, 
immediately? You should have told me then, 
Why didn’t you tell me? I would have surely told you, mama, but because of your mental health, I had a fear in my heart, that God forbid, something 
might happen. This Shaista and Idrees 
took advantage of this. Now you don’t worry at all. Your daughter is here. I will fix everything. That’s what will happen. Son, why are you taking 
these tablets? I have depression. I feel that my mind will explode. No, my love, please, get a grip on yourself. Just relax. I should relax? Someone is saying that be happy,
 someone is saying be sad, someone is saying become 
someone’s son, someone is saying become 
someone else’s son. Who am I? Salman is a winding toy. I did all this to save 
Mehreen’s life, son. Fine, Mr. Idrees is saying that
it was done for her, you are saying it was to 
save someone’s life. What had happened, tell me? What do you think? I have a fault in all this? Why don’t you think for yourself that what mother in the world
 will give a piece of her heart and hand it over to someone else…
A mother like you. Because you did all this. Only, you. Yes, I admit, I did it. But I never let you go away 
from my sight. I will not believe these meaningless
things you are saying. But you will agree, that I did all this for your betterment. I don’t want to hear this. My ears are tired of hearing
 this nonsense. This is not nonsense, son. 
This is the reality. So what happened to this reality? Did it achieve anything? Zero. We did achieve something. Now Salman is the only owner of the 
entire property, the entire business, and this home. This is what we achieved. I put a stone on my heart 
for your happiness, I was patient. What else can a mother do? Property. Business. You people have put me 
in a difficult situation. She was saying 
he is flying a kite, he is running around, 
something like that. What is she saying? Mehreen was already a little mad, your truth has made her 
completely mad. Yes, but I fear that she might harm someone. 
Especially Salman. She cannot harm anyone, and definitely not Salman. You accept her love for Salman? This is a reality, whether 
we accept it or not? You know, if Mehreen goes completely mad
it will benefit us. This way, Salman too will become 
ours easily and also all the properties. Salman, your anger and complaint 
towards me and Shaista is justified, but there is a big reality that 
you are not aware of. Really? So, there is some other reality that has to be revealed to me. You know as per the papers 
there is an Areej textile mill. Yes, I know. And you had asked me who is this Areej in whose name 
this textile mill is? I did ask you. Did you get the answer for it? None of you gave me any answer. And do you also know that Arooj’s parents are not her
 real parents… Yes, I surely know that. I was the one who helped Arooj 
to find her parents. There is no need for that. The Areej who want to find out
about is, Arooj. Mehreen’s lost daughter. This thing was hidden from everyone
 to hide it from Mehreen. What… What are you saying? How is this possible? The one who I always considered 
my mother, she is not my mother, 
but Arooj’s mother. Now you understand how you became the heir of 
the entire business and wealth, after Arooj went missing.
