Salman. Look, I understand, you don’t like whatever 
aunty is doing right now. Alizeh, why are we discussing 
all this right now? Salman, because 
we are friends. Look Alizeh, I need some time. Please leave me alone. Okay, take your time. But can I ask you something? Go ahead. Look, listen to me. If aunty doesn’t agree, you will still have to get married. Salman, then who will you marry? I don’t want to get married. This question is wrong. Did you get the answer 
for your question? Now please leave from here. I am scared seeing the intensity
 of your stubbornness. I swear. What stubbornness? Now, we have to see if you win in this stubbornness 
or your mama? Tell me something, aren’t you taking a little too 
much interest in this situation. Because I am interested in you, 
Salman. Salman, you are my friend, I care about you. That’s the thing or else I don’t care. Wow, aunt Mehreen. Wow. Meaning, I have come here from 
America to buy mangoes, right? I made the entire game, so I will be the one who wins. I have put the thought in 
aunt Mehreen, really well, now I am just waiting
 for the right time. The plane of my plan 
will fly on autopilot, by itself. Look, I know you are looking for 
a girl to get Salman married again. But this time, please, bring a girl after thinking hard. Please, aunty. Don’t bring anyone like Arooj, who distances you two 
from each other, completely. Bring such a girl, who stays happy with you, she makes you a family. She doesn’t separate you. Alizeh is absolutely right. I will get free from the way she is trying to take 
over my Salman in the name of love. The one who comes
 will be the one I chose. She will also give my Salman
 the happiness of a child. Alizeh thinks so well. She is so sincere. Whatever home such girls 
go to they bring life to it. Elder madam, little madam’s mother is here. Sister, I just came to request you that Arooj is a daughter 
I brought up with a lot of love. So, there is nothing new in this. All mothers bring up their
 daughters like this. You are right, this is what I meant. But if Arooj was your 
own daughter, and if her mother-in-law has
 treated her the same at her in-laws’ home… Don’t waste your time in useless 
and imaginary things. Relations aren’t formed
 by ifs and buts. Not just Arooj, I don’t have any daughter. I just have one son, Salman and he is most important for me. What are you doing 
with my daughter? And after all, why are in 
such a hurry for a child? Even delays won’t do anything. The reports say this, so what hurry or what delay? Arooj can never be a mother. So, you tell me, why should I ruin my Salman’s life? No medical science has 
progressed so much, there must be some treatment. Fine, you get the treatment done. Who has stopped you from 
getting the treatment done? But I cannot ruin my 
Salman’s life in all this. Have tea before going. You took so long. There was rush of 
people on the streets. I had told you I would come along, but… It is mothers who can tolerate the 
sorrows of daughters at their in-laws. If fathers go, their heart would explode. Master, daughters face a lot of sorrows. Naseema, is all okay? I wish, Mehreen has a daughter, then she would have known the sorrow of someone’s daughter. What happened? Tell me. They are not divorcing Arooj, but they are getting
 Salman married again. What? This is injustice with my daughter. What is her fault? There is no fault, apart from this, that she is living at her mother-in-law’s
 home and not her mother’s. Now, we are not 
sure how long we will live. We cannot even bring her here. Did you speak to Arooj? What does she want? Yes, even Arooj doesn’t 
agree to coming, and master, she has made a decision that if she leaves that home, then she will not even come live here. Then where will she live? Hey, madam Alizeh, what are you looking for? Tell me, I will give it to you. I was looking for a glass 
for the juice. Where is it? You go to your room, I will bring it. Wasai, I am not asking for myself. I am asking for aunt Mehreen. Okay. You go, I will take it. Wasai, I will give her this glass of juice. Where is the glass? Bring it. Hey, no, no, madam Alizeh, you leave it. This is my work, I will take it. You are a guest, after all. Now I am not a guest. I mean, I have been here for so long. You don’t remain a guest for so long. Go, bring the glass. Yes, I will give it. Here you go What happened? Do you want something else too? Wasai, tray. Won’t you give me a tray? I will bring it. Here you go. Come in. This. What is this, Alizeh? 
What was the need for this? Aunty Mehreen, there is a need. Just look at your face, your face has lost its glow, you have so much 
tension and worries. These worries have 
surrounded me, Alizeh. But not anymore, till I am here, 
you don’t need to worry. You don’t take care of yourself, so now I will take care of you. Alizeh. yes? Stay happy. May you live long. Thank you. Arooj. How are you? I am fine. Are you upset with me? What is my fault? When you don’t know 
what your fault is, then what can I tell you? But hearing you 
talk makes me feel that I have surely committed a crime. I have not setup a court here, and the court I believe in, there no injustice is done, ever. You tried getting me married again. But I am telling you, I will not get married. I will always reject it like this. and if the girl is of your 
choice, then? Alizeh, come to my room. Okay. What happened? You didn’t answer me. Mom, what are you saying? The girl I liked, I married her. For whose sake did you marry Arooj? For your sake, right? yes, that’s how it is. Fine, then, now you will get 
married for my sake. You called me? Yes, Alizeh, come here. Salman, I had called you here so that I could tell you, I have chosen Alizeh for you. And I will get you two 
married on this weekend. Are you upset with me? What is my fault? When you don’t know
 what your fault is, then what can I tell you? But hearing you talk 
makes me feel that I have surely committed a crime. What happened? I am surprised. You have asked me a weird 
question, Salman. You are reacting like you don’t know what happened 
and what is happening. Whatever is happening, 
let it happen. But nothing will happen. Changing the way of describing 
things doesn’t change the thing. Arooj, you think I am 
changing the topic? If you are not changing the topic, then you are surely 
ignoring it on purpose. I am not ignoring anything, there is nothing,
 nothing will happen. Can’t you see, Salman? I have become a stranger 
being in my own home. She makes fun of me 
again and again, she taunts me and you are saying 
there is nothing. Have patience. I am here. I will take care of everything. You know how much I love you. And I will not let anyone be
 a hurdle in my love. I won’t let anything happen. Salman, wait. Actually, I got you this perfume from the US, and I forgot to tell you this. Tell me, how is this scent? Stop it, Alizeh. Salman. We are only friends and we will only remain friends. Get this in your head. Salman! Wasai, what sort of scent is this? Elder madam, the bottle of the perfume broke. It didn’t break, it was broken. Who broke it? I got perfume for Salman 
with so much love, I just came here, and 
made him try it. I don’t know what he 
got so angry about. I didn’t even think Salman 
would change so much. He has changed so 
much towards me. Relax, Alizeh. Relax. Salman is doing
 all this to show to Arooj. You relax, and come to my room. Wasai, clean this up. Sure. Come on, come. Come in. Go ahead, Wasai. 
What is the matter? What happened? 
Why are you standing quietly? The thing is such. What is the matter? Maybe you don’t know anything. What don’t I know? Speak up, Wasai. The thing about little master’s second marriage… Won’t you ask me, with whom? Who? With madam Alizeh. Shanzay was absolutely right. This girl came to this home 
with some motive. Did you say something to me, 
little madam? Where is Salman? I don’t know about him. Fine, you leave. Sure. Mehreen, how can you do this? The same way the
 mothers of others do. But those boys also
 have wives. Are they not anyone’s
 daughters? This is something the mothers
 of those girls should think about. I didn’t even do anything, but… but he is doubting me so much? You know, there is something. Poor thing is not doubting wrong. I had not even thought coming
 from the US, that I will get to see so much adventure 
as soon as I reach here. But anyway, if I have found a shelter, then what is the harm in this? It is good. Salman. Why are you so angry? Mom made her decision and you are asking me why am I so angry? Tell me, what is going on? Salman, what would I know what is going on? I mean, how will I have an idea what aunt is liking. She is not thinking, she has made a decision. Salman, how am I responsible for the 
decisions aunt Mehreen takes? I mean, how would I know
 when she thinks what, what she doesn’t think. What she wants to do or what she doesn’t want to know. How would I know? I cannot believe that you 
wouldn’t know. Why can you not believe it? Tell me, something, why did mom leave the entire 
world and select you, huh? Salman. Salman. It can be a coincidence, right? No. It’s impossible. First, listen to me. Nothing is impossible. And doubting you will
 not get you anything. I am not doubting you. I know it well that you 
are after all this. Really? Anyway, I will find out. But remember one thing, only what I want will 
happen in this home. He is doubting me for no reason. But he is not wrong either. I have heard something. Whatever you 
have heard is wrong. So meaning, what
 I heard is right. You are saying no with 
so much conviction, this means, yes. Meaning your acceptance
 is hiding in your refusal. I told you. Whatever you have 
heard is wrong. Then what is right? I don’t know. Really? Such a big decision is being 
made with regards to you and you are saying
 you are unaware. Arooj, I am not unaware. Neither am I unknowing. I just have not reached a decision, 
but I promise you, I will reach a decision soon. These things you are saying to avoid 
the question are worrying me. Answer my questions properly. I don’t have an answer. I don’t have an answer. Look, I am really worried right now, but I promise you, I will fix it all.
