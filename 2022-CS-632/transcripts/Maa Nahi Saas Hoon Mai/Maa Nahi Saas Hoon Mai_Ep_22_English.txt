Maybe you don’t know anything. What don’t I know? They are talking about little master’s
second marriage. Won’t you ask with whom? With whom? With madam Alizeh. Such a big decision is being 
made with regards to you and you are saying you are unaware. Arooj, I am not unaware. Neither am I unknowing. I just have not reached a decision, 
but I promise you, I will reach a decision soon. These things you are saying to avoid 
the question are worrying me. Answer my questions properly. I don’t have an answer. I don’t have an answer. Salman isn’t responding to properly 
on anything. His behaviour makes me feel like, gradually, he is saying no. He doesn’t have the courage 
to tell the truth, and the person who has made 
this decision is satisfied. Salman wont be able to tolerate 
the pressure from his mother for long. Oh wow, that’s a surprise. I feel my destination is not far now. Now, there is even distance between 
these Romeo and Juliet. Constant fire. Everything is on fire. It will not work like this Arooj. The sooner you accept this decision, 
it will be better for you. Your sorrow will reduce. There Salman is sitting in the lawn and he is lost in the smoke 
of his cigarette, and here you are staring at the sky. Whatever Salman is doing is 
on aunt Mehreen’s orders, he cannot ignore her decision. Aunt Mehreen told you this, not Salman. You are coaxing yourself like this, even though, the game is over. That is not true. The game is still left, and it will go till the last ball. I find your confidence funny. You are really stupid. Elder madam, should I serve breakfast? Where is Arooj. I had asked her, she refused to come. Salman, don’t you know why Arooj is not 
coming for breakfast? No, I don’t know. Why don’t you know? I don’t know the same way I didn’t know
that I getting married again. We have spoken on this topic earlier. Mom, we had just started talking, the conversation didn’t end. What do you want to say? I just want to say that I will end 
the thing you started. Wasai, go and call Arooj again and tell her 
that I am calling her. Sure. Come in. Little madam, elder madam is calling you 
for breakfast. Did you not tell aunty, 
that I don’t want to come? I told her, but… But? You bring my breakfast here 
on the table. I will not go downstairs 
and have breakfast. Why, younger madam? Because… because Alizeh is present there. So what will that do? Maybe nothing will happen, but I will be free from the feeling 
of mental torture. You tell aunty, 
that I don’t want to come. Sure. Little madam, you are my master, but it is your love that you never 
considered me a maid. My experience of the world is 
much more than you. If you want, I can give you an advice. Go ahead. Never leave your place empty. The game is over. The game is still left, and it will go till the last ball. I find your confidence funny. You are really stupid. You go ahead, I am coming. Okay. Elder madam, she is coming. Fine, Wasai, go serve breakfast. Okay. Arooj. Why were you not coming for breakfast? I am asking you something. Are you not aware of the methods 
of this home? Because on that dining table… in fact, maybe, there is no place for me 
in this home now. Who said this to you? Some things don’t need words. Alizeh’s presence in this home is 
making a lot of things obvious. Are you happy? Whatever is happening in this home 
is because of you. Along with Arooj, you have made 
all our lives difficult. I didn’t expect this from you. Did you make Salman stand 
against my decision? I didn’t say anything, aunty. I am not ready to believe this at all. Because my son was not like this. I didn’t know how anyone was, but yes, the situation makes a person change. and you created this situation. I created the situation? What have I done? 
What is my fault? I am not doing anything, aunty. Whatever is happening, 
you are doing it. Everything is happening 
cause of you, Arooj. You always blame me. Today, you will have to tell me 
what my fault is. If you had the capability 
to be a mother, then I wouldn’t have had 
to do all this. What happened? Did I say something wrong? No. I cannot even call you wrong. I am really sorry for you. Obviously, the thing is so big. But trust me Arooj,
I am not wrong here. I have no fault here. I am not even interested in Salman. I have no interest in him. Really? Then you might be interested 
in his business and status. Darling, I think you are forgetting
who I am. I have come from America. There are many much better 
than Salman there, you know? Yes, but all those people would know your style and the way you target. Arooj, you are insulting me now. Because you deserve this. If you try to ruin my home, then you will never be happy in your life. Hey, I don’t even want to stay happy. I am not doing this for my happiness. I am doing this for Salman and 
aunt Mehreen’s happiness. I mean, it is for them, not for me. I have to give them 
the happiness of a child, something you couldn’t give them. I just have to do it for them. Please don’t consider me wrong. Okay? Arooj. Man, I don’t know why mama is 
behaving with me like this. She loves me so much, 
she agrees to everything I say. But I don’t know what happens 
in Arooj’s case. Mother in law. Mother in law,
my friend. This is such a position, after getting it, motherhood hides somewhere. I agree to you, but she is my mother. Will she still do all this? Of course, she is your mother, and she will also stay your mother, but the emotions go to sleep in
the matters of the daughter in law. You tell me, what is sister in law 
Arooj’s reaction, after this adventure of aunt. She is depressed. She ought to be. You send Alizeh away. Here, your home is getting ruined and 
you are caring about friendship. I wish I had done it earlier, but I think it is late now. Mama won’t let me send her away. Hmmm. You do one thing, marry Alizeh. Have you gone mad? I will never do this. I am worried cause of this suffocation. All of them have me standing 
on the guillotine, but they are not announcing me 
to be hanged. It is becoming difficult for me 
to breathe in this home. I don’t find any ray of hope. I will have to do something. You don’t sit here, come and sit here. This is Arooj and this is Salman’s chair. She is not a guest anymore 
sister in law. She is going to be a member 
of this family. I have asked her to sit here. Sit, please. Thank you. Oh wow, you were hasty in becoming 
a host from guest. Bravo. Thank you, aunt. Sister in law, please, she is Salman’s future wife. So please, respect her. She is his future wife, she has still 
not become his wife. It will take her time to become his wife. After all, Arooj is coming, 
she won’t like it. You people can wait till then, right? Madam. Little madam is not in her room. If she is not in her room, then she must be in the lounge 
or garden. No, no, madam. I have seen every corner of the home, she is nowhere. The guard was telling me 
he saw her going out. Madam, even her phone is kept in her room. Alizeh, have food. 
Sure. Salman. Hello. Mama, I have been calling you for so long,
 why are you not answering my call? Salman, is everything okay? 
You sound a little worried. I called Arooj so many times, 
her phone is off. Where is she? Thank God, Salman, you are fine. Please, don’t talk like this. 
I get scared. This worry of yours will take 
my life one day. Mama, I am asking you a question 
for so long, why are you not answering? Where is Arooj? Why is her phone off? How would I know why her phone is off? And where is she herself? I don’t know son, she went out of the home 
without informing me. She went out. Where did she go? I am telling you Salman, she left the house without 
informing me. Arooj has made my life hell. Now she has worried Salman again. Hello. Salman, son, where are you? Arooj is not at home. 
She left somewhere. Yes, aunt, I am looking for her. But where did she go? 
I am unable to find her. Maybe she went to her parents home. that’s what I think. Now the situation of home has 
really become intolerable for Arooj. Don’t get me started about 
the environment of the home. Yes, you are right about that. So, son do one thing. Yes, tell me. You won’t tell anything 
to Arooj’s parents, those poor people will get worried 
for no reason. Yes, aunt, after all 
what will they think? I married Arooj 
after so much insistence, and now what is all this 
that is happening? There is nothing like that. You don’t blame yourself, son 
and don’t worry yourself either. Arooj will come back soon. Okay, son. Where have you gone, Arooj? Where has this girl gone? How can she leave without 
informing like this? Aunt, did you find out something about Arooj? No. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. Poor thing. Aunt, is everything okay? Why are you looking at me like that? The day I had seen you being
so frank with Salman, I had my doubts that it is you who will spread poison
in Salman and Arooj’s life. What is wrong, aunt? All that you are seeing, 
whatever that is happening, is being done on aunt Mehreen’s directive,
it is as per her wish. No, my eyes cannot be deceived. You are behind all this. Because of you, Arooj left this home
and went. Aunt, what is wrong? Why are you blaming poor me? That too without a reason. It is surely a blame, but it is not without a reason. Anyway, I don’t want to talk to you on this topic. Right now, Arooj is important for me. Hey. Hey. Hey. Aunt. Poor, aunt. Do you even care? The whole day has passed and Arooj still hasn’t come back home. What is there to worry 
in this sister in law? It is possible that she went 
to her mother’s home. Yes, it is possible. But if this doesn’t happen, then? So sister in law, what can I do? She is not a child. I wish you were the mother 
of a daughter, then you would have understood 
the sorrow of a daughter. The mother of a daughter? Even you are not a mother. In fact, you are not a mother. I still gave birth to Salman, that is why, please sister in law, don’t give me a lecture 
on feeling this pain. Salman. Yes. You have Salman. But Mehreen, every woman has motherhood 
inside her, whether she has a child or not. Maybe you are not aware of 
the motherhood hidden inside me. Pray that you never find out about it,
either. She was telling me 
what a mother is.
