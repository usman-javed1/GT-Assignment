Where are you coming from, son? When a person comes home, you ask how they are. You don’t start questioning them. You are really late, 
that’s why I am asking. I am not a school going kid, that I go on time and 
come back on time. I am a businessman, people know me as Salman. No one knows me as your son. But nowadays you don’t go 
to the office, right? Why do you ask? I am your mother, that is why 
I am asking. Ask me questions that match the type 
of mother you are. You are back, is Salman still in office? Salman seldomly comes 
to the office. Really? Then he must go out for meetings? It is not that. He goes out, he has outings. That is really good. Let him enjoy. This burden has finally been 
lifted from his head. This is the time;
 he has to enjoy. After all, why does he need to work? He has employees to work for him. What has happened to Salman? I understand everything. But, this Idrees doesn’t get it. The father and son are getting out of hands. Surely, those two mother 
and daughter have got magic done on them. Idrees doesn’t accept this. What does him accepting it 
or not accepting it do? This truth cannot stay hidden. I will make sure I reveal 
these actions of those two. I will call my friend Shahnaz. She will find a solution. She is really cunning, she makes the best of conspiracies. But when am I making her plan 
a conspiracy? I will just take her advice, so that I can save my Salman. I will call her. Look, I believe in planning, but now that you are saying it, 
then I know a psychic. But I can’t guarantee if your work
gets done or not. Shahnaz, what are you saying? I called you trusting that you will solve my issue. Now you are saying this. I have even given an online psychic 
money and pictures of the home. And he has said that he will get 
my work done from there. This is the limit Shaista. What sort of things are you 
saying in your worry? I could never imagine that 
you could think like this. Listen to me, Shaista, we are the biggest psychics 
and magicians. Do something that Salman 
becomes yours. After all, he is your blood. I kept my blood distant from me, this is what Salman is angry about. Okay, I will think of something 
and make a plan, that Salman be yours. But I will tell you something, don’t fall in the trap of these psychics, you will not get anything from them. Shahnaz, Salman will be mine but, just relying on that 
won't be enough. I have to remove someone 
from my way, that’s when I will surely 
be victorious. Remove someone from the way? What do you mean? Tell me clearly. Just think that there is a girl that I don’t want to see alive. Oh, okay, so that’s the deal. I am afraid of your intentions Shaista. I cannot help you in such a thing. I am really sorry 
No, no, Shahnaz, how can you leave like this? I have called you with 
so much hope, that you will do my work.
Please don’t go. It is right for me leave. I don’t want to get myself stuck 
in such work and get in any trouble, Shaista.
I am really sorry. And whose responsibility is Areej? Her mother’s. Meaning, if the mother is the enemy,
then the daughter is also your enemy. You are really tough. Okay, you leave all this. You come and sit, I have to talk 
to you about something important. Come on. Don’t you think, Salman has changed a little. He has become really bitter. He has even started 
misbehaving with us. He didn’t do this earlier. What do you want to say, Shaista? I feel Mehreen and Arooj have 
got magic done on Salman. This is the limit Shaista, 
there is nothing like that. You can note this down, I am sure there is something 
suspicious. Shaista, I already have 
to think a lot, now you are putting me 
on another path. Fine, I don’t need anyone’s help. I will get my work done myself. There is a line of psychics on 
the corner of every street. I will get my work done myself. She is telling me. You came suddenly. You didn’t even inform us 
before coming. If we knew something, 
we would have told you. Arooj, is everything fine? Papa, that… Sister, Mehreen, you tell us, what is the matter? Is all okay? Actually, we left that home and came. You left that home? What happened, Arooj? There was no space left for us to live in that hatred filled 
environment. Mama was really scared that my life and Areej’s life could
be in danger living there. They dragged them out 
of the home. They snatched the daughter. I think you should take 
the help of the law. Naseema, if I get disappointed, 
then we will go to the law. A lot of time will pass like this. It is a question of two lives. On one hand there is our Arooj and on the other, it’s Areej. You are right. After going to the court, the door for negotiation closes and also the way to return. If you are thinking that Salman will take Arooj, then you are wrong. No, this is possible. He dragged Arooj out of the home, and you are still mistaken. This is the limit. Arooj hasn’t even seen her father. If he was alive, then he would never let Arooj be 
dragged out of the home like this. But, I am alive. I am her father. I will make sure I send Arooj 
back to her home. You? You were in the office, right? Yes, I had forgotten the money, I came to get it. I had kept two hundred thousand
rupees here, now one hundred thousand is missing. I remember well, this was 
two hundred thousand, how did it get reduced? You will not get that money now. What do you mean? I have given that one hundred 
thousand rupees to an online psychic. What for? He has said that he will perform 
such a practice from there, that our son Salman will 
stop misbehaving with us, and all of our other issues 
will be resolved too. This is the limit, Shaista. 
You are educated and is this how you think? Women of your class don’t 
do these things. When there is difficulty, you have to choose 
whatever path you find. Be quiet Shaista, 
I am already worried. And wait, for what I am planning. You don’t need to think 
something wrong. You surprise me. 
I had kept it for some work. When that psychic will do 
all our work, then I will ask you, who is educated and 
who is illiterate. Greetings. Greetings. Who do you want to meet? I want to meet Mr. Salman. Did you take an appointment? No, I didn’t take an appointment, but it is important that 
I meet him. Sir is really busy, it is difficult without an appointment. You tell him that Arooj’s father…. no, you tell him Master Shoaib has come. Okay, you wait. I will see. Sure. Sure. Sign this and deliver it to 
the boss's office, okay? Sir. 
Come in. Sir, the print is here, 
see if there is any correction. No, I think this is perfect. You can review the rest. Sir, some man is sitting to meet you. So did you not tell him that I don’t meet, 
without an appointment. I told him, but sir, he is saying 
he has some important work. What is his name? Master Shoaib. Master Shoaib. Fine, you tell him to wait. Sir Sir is a little busy, 
you will have to wait. Fine, I will wait. You give me a glass of water, I have to take some medicine. Yes, sure. Sit. Bring a glass of water 
in the waiting lounge. Okay. Is your work done? Tell me. What are you doing here?
Are you taking care of her? Madam, I was swinging her. So? I had told you not to. Madam, she was crying a lot.
So I was putting her to sleep. Who hired you in this home? Me? Or her mother? Yes, you. Then why don’t you listen to me? You are in this home to do my work and not to take care of her. Keep her, here and 
go make tea for me. This is injustice. A daughter is with her father, what is unjust in this?
What did I do wrong? The wrong is that, right now she 
should have been with her mother. So, she is with her mother. With my mother. She will die without her mother. I didn’t die without my mother, 
that Arooj didn’t die without her mother. Salman, if something happened 
accidentally, what enjoyment do you want to drive,
by applying it to yourself? I don’t want to enjoy anything. I want to humiliate Arooj,
I want to give her pain. Sister-in-law, Arooj has no fault. It is her fault. She came in my life, 
she ruined it. You are forgetting one thing 
in your anger and disgust. And this is the biggest flaw of anger. What? 
What am I forgetting? That sister-in-law Arooj was 
your love, and you married out of love. This is your wedding gift. How did you like it? It is really beautiful. yes, it is beautiful, but not more than you. Oh my God, she is crying again. Salman, what problem have you 
put me in, by bringing her? You want to torture Arooj, and here I am being tortured 
because of her. Yes, Salman. Hello mom. How is Areej? Areej is absolutely fine, son. I have just gone crazy 
in taking care of her. I am tired. I am fulfilling everything you 
and dad expect of me. I know son, that is why I am quiet or else it is really difficult for me 
to take care of such a small child. I get tired. I can hear Areej crying, 
you go and check on her. Yes, yes, I will check on her.
You put the phone down. Be quiet. My ears will explode. Oh God, my head. Chandu. Chandu, come and 
take care of her. Oh God, stop it.
Be quiet. You scared me. I thought that my life is over. Your life got saved. In fact, it brought another life 
in this world. You are really brave. You tolerated a lot of pain, but you didn’t let anything 
happen to our daughter. Mothers can do anything 
for their children. I have understood this pain today. You are a liar. In fact, not just a liar, 
you can fake love too. Arooj! Lower your voice. You showed fake love to me, you falsely apologized to mama, and now… now you will sacrifice your life 
for your daughter. I am sure you are lying about that. What did you think? What did you think that I will 
not find out anything? I have read all those papers, 
Salman. What will you do? Huh? What will you do with this wealth? Is all this more precious 
than selfless love?
