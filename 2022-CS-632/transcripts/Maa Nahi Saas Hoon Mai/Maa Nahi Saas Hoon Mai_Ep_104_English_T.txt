[26.92] Where are you coming from, son?
[30.96] When a person comes home,
[33.36] you ask how they are.
[39.20] You don’t start questioning them.
[43.68] You are really late, 
that’s why I am asking.
[47.32] I am not a school going kid,
[49.52] that I go on time and 
come back on time.
[58.76] I am a businessman,
[67.16] people know me as Salman.
[71.36] No one knows me as your son.
[76.92] But nowadays you don’t go 
to the office, right?
[82.08] Why do you ask?
[83.96] I am your mother, that is why 
I am asking.
[87.40] Ask me questions
[90.32] that match the type 
of mother you are.
[147.88] You are back,
[150.16] is Salman still in office?
[153.24] Salman seldomly comes 
to the office.
[156.76] Really?
[158.88] Then he must go out for meetings?
[162.80] It is not that. He goes out,
[165.60] he has outings.
[167.32] That is really good.
[172.24] Let him enjoy.
[174.44] This burden has finally been 
lifted from his head.
[183.36] This is the time;
 he has to enjoy.
[189.04] After all, why does he need to work?
[190.92] He has employees to work for him.
[196.92] What has happened to Salman?
[204.28] I understand everything.
[211.16] But, this Idrees doesn’t get it.
[220.76] The father and son
[227.96] are getting out of hands.
[235.12] Surely, those two mother 
and daughter
[241.36] have got magic done on them.
[248.28] Idrees doesn’t accept this.
[253.80] What does him accepting it 
or not accepting it do?
[258.76] This truth cannot stay hidden.
[266.68] I will make sure I reveal 
these actions of those two.
[277.32] I will call my friend Shahnaz.
[283.80] She will find a solution.
[289.40] She is really cunning,
[291.20] she makes the best of conspiracies.
[296.16] But when am I making her plan 
a conspiracy?
[304.00] I will just take her advice,
[310.04] so that I can save my Salman.
[316.64] I will call her.
[351.52] Look, I believe in planning,
[354.88] but now that you are saying it, 
then I know a psychic.
[359.72] But I can’t guarantee if your work
gets done or not.
[365.16] Shahnaz, what are you saying?
[368.00] I called you trusting that
[371.72] you will solve my issue.
[377.12] Now you are saying this.
[378.76] I have even given an online psychic 
money and pictures of the home.
[383.20] And he has said that he will get 
my work done from there.
[386.92] This is the limit Shaista.
[388.48] What sort of things are you 
saying in your worry?
[394.60] I could never imagine that 
you could think like this.
[402.56] Listen to me, Shaista,
[404.52] we are the biggest psychics 
and magicians.
[413.36] Do something that Salman 
becomes yours.
[425.40] After all, he is your blood.
[431.16] I kept my blood distant from me,
[435.84] this is what Salman is angry about.
[438.60] Okay,
[440.04] I will think of something 
and make a plan,
[446.96] that Salman be yours.
[453.76] But I will tell you something,
[455.68] don’t fall in the trap of these psychics,
[457.84] you will not get anything from them.
[462.88] Shahnaz,
[465.08] Salman will be mine
[469.84] but,
[472.32] just relying on that 
won't be enough.
[477.28] I have to remove someone 
from my way,
[479.92] that’s when I will surely 
be victorious.
[483.32] Remove someone from the way?
[485.00] What do you mean?
[486.72] Tell me clearly.
[488.88] Just think that there is a girl
[493.84] that I don’t want to see alive.
[496.48] Oh,
[498.36] okay, so that’s the deal.
[505.80] I am afraid of your intentions Shaista.
[515.72] I cannot help you in such a thing.
[518.44] I am really sorry 
No, no, Shahnaz,
[521.12] how can you leave like this?
[522.44] I have called you with 
so much hope,
[524.36] that you will do my work.
Please don’t go.
[528.28] It is right for me leave.
[530.44] I don’t want to get myself stuck 
in such work
[532.48] and get in any trouble, Shaista.
I am really sorry.
[550.64] And whose responsibility is Areej?
[552.32] Her mother’s.
[553.80] Meaning, if the mother is the enemy,
then the daughter is also your enemy.
[555.68] You are really tough.
[557.20] Okay, you leave all this.
[559.28] You come and sit, I have to talk 
to you about something important.
[561.56] Come on.
[571.32] Don’t you think,
[574.16] Salman has changed a little.
[577.64] He has become really bitter.
[579.64] He has even started 
misbehaving with us.
[581.48] He didn’t do this earlier.
[583.80] What do you want to say, Shaista?
[585.64] I feel Mehreen and Arooj have 
got magic done on Salman.
[590.64] This is the limit Shaista, 
there is nothing like that.
[594.76] You can note this down,
[596.92] I am sure there is something 
suspicious.
[599.40] Shaista, I already have 
to think a lot,
[601.36] now you are putting me 
on another path.
[608.80] Fine,
[610.24] I don’t need anyone’s help.
[613.16] I will get my work done myself.
[615.72] There is a line of psychics on 
the corner of every street.
[621.16] I will get my work done myself.
[624.60] She is telling me.
[652.52] You came suddenly.
[654.72] You didn’t even inform us 
before coming.
[659.16] If we knew something, 
we would have told you.
[663.56] Arooj, is everything fine?
[666.72] Papa, that…
[670.44] Sister, Mehreen, you tell us,
[672.72] what is the matter? Is all okay?
[677.24] Actually,
[679.72] we left that home and came.
[684.72] You left that home?
[689.40] What happened, Arooj?
[692.48] There was no space left for us
[695.80] to live in that hatred filled 
environment.
[703.80] Mama was really scared
[706.48] that my life and Areej’s life could
be in danger living there.
[753.32] They dragged them out 
of the home.
[756.88] They snatched the daughter.
[759.80] I think you should take 
the help of the law.
[766.16] Naseema, if I get disappointed, 
then we will go to the law.
[770.84] A lot of time will pass like this.
[774.48] It is a question of two lives.
[778.16] On one hand there is our Arooj
[782.08] and on the other, it’s Areej.
[787.16] You are right.
[791.08] After going to the court,
[794.52] the door for negotiation closes
[799.00] and also the way to return.
[802.72] If you are thinking
[805.52] that Salman will take Arooj,
[810.32] then you are wrong.
[812.88] No, this is possible.
[820.44] He dragged Arooj out of the home,
[824.64] and you are still mistaken.
[829.24] This is the limit.
[839.12] Arooj hasn’t even seen her father.
[846.72] If he was alive,
[850.44] then he would never let Arooj be 
dragged out of the home like this.
[857.48] But, I am alive.
[862.68] I am her father.
[869.44] I will make sure I send Arooj 
back to her home.
[948.20] You?
[950.72] You were in the office, right?
[952.20] Yes, I had forgotten the money,
[954.48] I came to get it.
[957.44] I had kept two hundred thousand
rupees here,
[959.64] now one hundred thousand is missing.
[960.96] I remember well, this was 
two hundred thousand,
[962.36] how did it get reduced?
[965.12] You will not get that money now.
[969.20] What do you mean?
[970.44] I have given that one hundred 
thousand rupees to an online psychic.
[974.08] What for?
[976.32] He has said that he will perform 
such a practice from there,
[986.64] that our son Salman will 
stop misbehaving with us,
[993.84] and all of our other issues 
will be resolved too.
[999.40] This is the limit, Shaista. 
You are educated
[1001.64] and is this how you think?
[1007.36] Women of your class don’t 
do these things.
[1009.72] When there is difficulty,
[1011.52] you have to choose 
whatever path you find.
[1014.16] Be quiet Shaista, 
I am already worried.
[1016.64] And wait, for what I am planning.
[1018.64] You don’t need to think 
something wrong.
[1021.24] You surprise me. 
I had kept it for some work.
[1046.16] When that psychic will do 
all our work,
[1049.64] then I will ask you,
[1051.60] who is educated and 
who is illiterate.
[1244.80] Greetings.
[1247.24] Greetings.
[1249.60] Who do you want to meet?
[1253.16] I want to meet Mr. Salman.
[1257.20] Did you take an appointment?
[1260.04] No, I didn’t take an appointment,
[1262.60] but it is important that 
I meet him.
[1267.04] Sir is really busy,
[1268.60] it is difficult without an appointment.
[1272.20] You tell him that Arooj’s father….
[1275.64] no,
[1276.56] you tell him Master Shoaib has come.
[1279.04] Okay, you wait. I will see.
[1280.88] Sure. Sure.
[1282.68] Sign this and deliver it to 
the boss's office, okay?
[1327.48] Sir. 
Come in.
[1330.16] Sir, the print is here, 
see if there is any correction.
[1341.52] No, I think this is perfect.
[1343.64] You can review the rest.
[1347.16] Sir, some man is sitting to meet you.
[1351.00] So did you not tell him that
[1353.60] I don’t meet, 
without an appointment.
[1355.96] I told him, but sir, he is saying 
he has some important work.
[1359.84] What is his name?
[1362.28] Master Shoaib.
[1366.52] Master Shoaib.
[1370.48] Fine,
[1372.88] you tell him to wait.
[1376.80] Sir
[1434.08] Sir is a little busy, 
you will have to wait.
[1438.08] Fine, I will wait.
[1440.56] You give me a glass of water,
[1442.96] I have to take some medicine.
[1444.96] Yes, sure. Sit.
[1453.76] Bring a glass of water 
in the waiting lounge.
[1456.60] Okay.
[1459.72] Is your work done?
[1462.64] Tell me.
[1480.76] What are you doing here?
Are you taking care of her?
[1483.32] Madam, I was swinging her.
[1485.40] So?
[1486.80] I had told you not to.
[1488.76] Madam, she was crying a lot.
So I was putting her to sleep.
[1492.48] Who hired you in this home?
[1494.96] Me? Or her mother?
[1498.28] Yes, you.
[1499.44] Then why don’t you listen to me?
[1502.12] You are in this home to do my work
[1504.68] and not to take care of her.
[1508.12] Keep her, here and 
go make tea for me.
[1566.52] This is injustice.
[1567.92] A daughter is with her father,
[1569.60] what is unjust in this?
What did I do wrong?
[1571.84] The wrong is that, right now she 
should have been with her mother.
[1575.96] So, she is with her mother.
[1579.36] With my mother.
[1581.48] She will die without her mother.
[1583.80] I didn’t die without my mother, 
that Arooj didn’t die without her mother.
[1588.32] Salman, if something happened 
accidentally,
[1592.20] what enjoyment do you want to drive,
by applying it to yourself?
[1597.60] I don’t want to enjoy anything.
[1601.36] I want to humiliate Arooj,
I want to give her pain.
[1607.16] Sister-in-law, Arooj has no fault.
[1608.80] It is her fault.
[1610.68] She came in my life, 
she ruined it.
[1616.08] You are forgetting one thing 
in your anger and disgust.
[1619.04] And this is the biggest flaw of anger.
[1623.32] What? 
What am I forgetting?
[1625.64] That sister-in-law Arooj was 
your love,
[1627.76] and you married out of love.
[1639.36] This is your wedding gift.
[1677.04] How did you like it?
[1683.92] It is really beautiful.
[1686.68] yes, it is beautiful,
[1690.68] but not more than you.
[1726.64] Oh my God,
[1729.20] she is crying again.
[1735.16] Salman, what problem have you 
put me in, by bringing her?
[1739.20] You want to torture Arooj,
[1742.12] and here I am being tortured 
because of her.
[1751.20] Yes, Salman.
[1753.68] Hello mom.
[1755.76] How is Areej?
[1757.96] Areej is absolutely fine, son.
[1760.32] I have just gone crazy 
in taking care of her.
[1763.96] I am tired.
[1767.08] I am fulfilling everything you 
and dad expect of me.
[1772.32] I know son,
[1774.04] that is why I am quiet
[1781.36] or else it is really difficult for me 
to take care of such a small child.
[1786.60] I get tired.
[1793.64] I can hear Areej crying, 
you go and check on her.
[1798.64] Yes, yes, I will check on her.
You put the phone down.
[1809.64] Be quiet.
[1812.04] My ears will explode.
[1815.64] Oh God, my head.
[1824.20] Chandu.
[1825.56] Chandu, come and 
take care of her.
[1828.96] Oh God, stop it.
Be quiet.
[1851.84] You scared me.
[1856.56] I thought that my life is over.
[1865.16] Your life got saved.
[1868.64] In fact,
[1871.00] it brought another life 
in this world.
[1879.80] You are really brave.
[1884.40] You tolerated a lot of pain,
[1890.24] but you didn’t let anything 
happen to our daughter.
[1899.12] Mothers can do anything 
for their children.
[1908.04] I have understood this pain today.
[1934.48] You are a liar.
[1937.32] In fact, not just a liar, 
you can fake love too.
[1940.80] Arooj!
[1941.68] Lower your voice.
[1945.48] You showed fake love to me,
[1949.20] you falsely apologized to mama,
[1951.68] and now…
[1954.12] now you will sacrifice your life 
for your daughter.
[1957.76] I am sure you are lying about that.
[1962.04] What did you think?
[1963.84] What did you think that I will 
not find out anything?
[1968.00] I have read all those papers, 
Salman.
[1979.28] What will you do? Huh?
[1982.40] What will you do with this wealth?
[1984.88] Is all this more precious 
than selfless love?
