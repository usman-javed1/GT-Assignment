You just don’t worry at all, I will do as you order. If you don’t mind, 
may I say something? Sure? Madam’s behavior... Hmm, I understand what you are 
trying to say, I have been noticing too that sister in law
Shaista’s behavior is changed. Wasai, keep your eyes and ears, 
both open, okay now look after your work, 
there is a lot of work. Okay. Arooj is absolutely fine and you have become 
a grandmother. Yes. Wasai? Yes, Madam Sr? As the driver to bring 
a lot of sweets, Daughter has been born 
to my Salman. yes, yes, yes, 
I will just bring it. She looked exactly like you to me. Same eyes, same nose, 
and everything. Like me? yes. Obviously, she is the daughter of our Boss Jr, she must be like you only. I have the same doubts, I don’t have any proof but I even know you have enemies in this house, I don’t want to make you worried but it is important for the sake of 
my loyalty towards this house that I suggest you to stay cautious. Are you hinting towards Aunt? I might be, because when Madam Sr 
brought the soup, that soup fell and as soon as the cat had 
that leftover soup, she died on the spot. What are you thinking? Nothing, I am thinking about how our daughter’s future 
would be. Our daughter’s present is 
amazing as well and her future will be the best too. You know what? You have given me a huge happiness. That is written on your face. Yes. And on that note of happiness, 
we have arranged a party today, Mom is looking after 
all the arrangements. Wow, she should be looking after it, she has become a grandmother. exactly, she is looking after everything out of the
happiness of becoming a grandmother. Listen, invite everyone from the office, they are like our family members too. Learn to make friends, enemies are made automatically. What happened now? nothing. Nothing is happening according 
to my will. And now there is a party in this house. Yes, I know and some of the people 
from the office are coming as well. Idrees, don’t you think everything that is happening today 
is just like it happened before? For example, 
what happened before? You always forget, don’t you remember when Waqar had a daughter, and now Salman had a daughter, even at that time there was a 
similar sort of party, there were people from the office, there were celebrations, and the exact same thing is 
happening today. Yes, and even at that time you were 
not happy on the birth of that girl Areej and even today you are not happy
on the arrival of this girl. The behavior of younger ones is changing 
with the elders despite of you being here. Why? What happened, Shaista? By the way, even I am noticing changed behavior 
in this house, but I didn’t say it to anyone. Mom, you know that 
Salman is my son. Oh-ho, everyone knows that but what you have forgotten is that Salman and Mehreen loves 
each other a lot. You have just given birth to Salman, I guess you forgot this and 
Salman is just a child, and children do everything 
of their choice. will Mehreen give the same 
importance to Salman when she has a child of her own? If Salman is neglected, his personality will be shattered. Stop thinking like that, Shaista, no one will ignore him. Yes, yes, Mom came in the afternoon only, I and Salman came together. Thank God that you are fine and talking nicely. Mom, God just saved us, we had your prayers with us else, there were no stones left unturned. No stones left unturned? I didn’t get it, my child. Who did what? Umm, I will tell you later. Anyway, I call you because you and 
Dad our coming to our house, Salman has arranged a get-together at 
our home to celebrate the birth of his daughter and you guys have to come. Let it be, my child, I and your dad will send a lot of 
prayers your way from here only. If we come there, Mehreen will not like it at all and then she will bother you. Do you know, I have even started to like her
strict attitude now. I feel love towards her. Yes, my child, after all, she is your mother. I found the mother 
who birthed me and you have raised me, I love you equally, Mom. and I am so lucky to get love 
from two mothers. Stay blessed, my child. So you and Dad are coming 
in the evening and I have a very important work 
from you that only you can do, I even want to talk to you. Work? What work? okay then, I will see you later. Bye. Madam Jr, she is exactly like your childhood. How can Aunt do this? Someone can hate or 
dislike someone but how can someone kill anyone? You are very innocent, Madam Jr. The people who want, they are cruel enough to kill 
someone as well. So then my daughter? You must rest, your daughter is absolutely safe. Don’t worry. They have kept her in baby care 
for now. Greetings Madam. Greetings, Mr Aslam, how are you?
I am fine, Madam. Have a seat. So tell me, how are our accounts 
coming so far? everything is fine by the grace of God. 
Amazing. All the staff should get all 
these cheques today. Yes, sir. Thank You. What is all this, Salman? Mom, my princess, my daughter has come to this world, so I thought of giving my staff 
a bonus on this happy occasion. Salman, you gave bonus on 
the birth of your daughter, you have told this to me 
before as well, right? No, mom, I didn’t. Why? What happened? So then why do I feel that I have heard this
before somewhere too? Cheque, bonus, happiness on the arrival 
of a daughter, birth. I have seen or definitely heard it 
somewhere before. No Mom, there is nothing like that, 
I guess you have some misunderstanding. No, no, this has happened somewhere 
before or, I have seen it with my own eyes. This has happened. No one can deny me on this. Where have I heard this? excuse me, everyone, may I have your attention please, now comes my princess, my daughter, who has brought the light 
to our home. Here she comes. We want you to raise her. I? How will I be able to take care of her...
Umm.. Mom? 
Salman. There is no one as caring as you. No one can raise her better than you. Now quickly tell us what have you 
named our daughter? Sister Mehreen, I have brought a very pretty gift 
for this little fairy. If you may allow? Yes, yes, you can definitely 
give it to her, you have a relationship 
with her too. We have named her Areej and we want you to put 
this bracelet on Areej. yes. Salman, hold her and 
take care of her carefully, meanwhile, 
I will put her gift on her. So finally you named her 
by your choice? yes. Areej is a beautiful name. What happened, Mom? Salman. Waqar is no longer 
in this world now. My Son left me, Mehreen. Mom, are you okay? Mom? Aunt, are you okay? Mom? Mom? Mom, get up. Wasai, ask the driver 
to take the car out. Mr Salman, come with me, please. Whenever anything like this happens, the reaction is exactly the same, because her brain cannot tolerate
 any burden at all. But Doctor, nothing happened, 
it was a happy occasion, my daughter was born, mom didn’t take any stress so how did she get unwell?
I don’t get it. That is not possible, Mr Salman, something has definitely happened, and you know it better. But there is nothing to worry about, I have given her an injection, and when she wakes, 
she will be normal, if God wills. If God wills. Come, I will drop you. 
Come. I guess I was around the same age when I got away from my parents. My life is such a riddle, it might end while solving it. I don’t get it, who should I tell all this to? I understand but if Madam Sr’s mental condition
wasn’t bad and there was no danger to her life, I would have told the truth in at once 
and failed Madam. But for now, we have to keep 
this secret as a secret. When will I tell her? How will I tell her? My haste... can become a problem for Mom. No, no. I have to stop myself for now. I don’t know how she must be now. Wasai? Wasai? Coming, Madam Jr. yes? Areej is sleeping, 
you stay with her, I will be right back. 
Don’t leave her alone. Sure, sure, you may go. Madam Areej, you did wonders, you came back into this house. Shall I tell you something fun? Madam Sr, she is your 
paternal grandmother though she is your maternal 
grandmother and your paternal grandmother.
