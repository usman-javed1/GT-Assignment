[20.96] The Areej that you wanted 
to know about is Arooj,
[24.44] Mehreen’s missing daughter.
[31.24] To hide this from Mehreen,
[33.84] we hid it from everyone.
[38.36] What?
[42.12] What are you saying?
[54.76] How is this possible?
[64.20] The one who I always thought 
to be my mother
[69.48] is not my mother but Arooj’s?
[74.00] Now you understand how you were 
made the heir of the entire property
[78.04] and business after 
Arooj went missing?
[104.24] I will go mad.
[106.08] No.
[107.68] You don’t have to get mad, 
you need to act very sanely.
[115.80] Arooj is a very clever girl,
[117.68] she is also the heir to the entire 
business and property.
[121.28] But she is my wife.
[122.76] She is Mehreen’s daughter,
[129.12] now that the reality is 
in front of you,
[131.72] don’t expect anything good 
from Mehreen as well,
[146.00] and Arooj will stand with her mother 
in this situation.
[159.68] I don’t know what is 
all this going on.
[187.16] Salman,
[190.56] what are you looking for?
[195.08] I am looking for myself.
[203.36] I am lost.
[206.04] You are not lost,
[208.84] you have been found.
[210.60] You shut up!
[216.96] I don’t want to listen to anything, 
go away.
[226.28] Aunt Mehreen is very unwell,
[231.60] she is in the room.
[325.88] Mom, I feel like I am dreaming.
[331.84] Your dream has now come true,
 my child.
[337.04] Yes,
[339.36] you are absolutely right.
[345.44] Do you know,
[347.64] after meeting mom,
[350.68] I have waited for so long to hug her?
[355.36] Why does your tone sound so sad 
all of a sudden, Arooj, my child.
[364.20] You figured it out by my tone 
that I am sad?
[370.28] What if I didn’t birth you?
[377.52] I am still your mother.
[385.28] Anyway, leave it,
[388.68] you tell me the reason behind
 your sadness.
[392.76] I am just sad about one thing, mom,
[395.00] that why my mom didn’t see
 my childhood.
[402.64] Who are you talking to Arooj?
[410.40] Umm,
[412.08] umm I,
[413.76] I was talking to Mom, 
I’ll phone…
[415.84] No, no, let it be, don’t do this at all,
 don’t do it.
[418.84] In fact, give it to me, 
I will talk to her.
[425.52] You will talk to her?
[427.96] Yes.
[430.80] Okay.
[433.32] Hello? 
Yes, my child?
[437.72] Mom wants to talk to you.
[456.72] Umm, look,
[459.36] talk to Mom,
[462.60] our Arooj is so fortunate,
[469.64] she has two mothers.
[476.80] Yes,
[478.80] our Arooj is very fortunate,
[487.40] she has two mothers,
[490.08] the one who birthed
[493.28] and the one who raised her.
[497.20] Sister Naseema,
[499.88] I don’t understand how to 
apologize to you,
[514.72] thank you so very much
[517.48] you raised my Arooj so well.
[532.32] I will forever be grateful to you.
[537.28] What favor?
[540.44] I just fulfilled a mother’s duty.
[544.44] Thank you so much,
[546.88] bye. 
Bye.
[605.52] What is this?
[610.12] You started crying yourself while 
trying to console your mother.
[618.56] I am crying about my fate,
[624.60] I found my mother after so long, 
after so many efforts,
[627.84] after so many difficulties,
[636.36] and when I found my mom,
[640.28] I am sad that she is not 
ready to hug me.
[676.72] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[679.92] Tell Mr Salman, 
Advocate Basit Alvi is here.
[682.48] Okay, sir.
[684.04] Did you note all the points?
[685.92] Yes sir.
[687.76] Perfect,
[688.92] then do share it with me
whatever feedback you get.
[691.60] Yes, sir.
[692.68] Thank you.
[696.08] Sir, Advocate Basit Alvi is here.
[699.12] Okay, get him seated, 
I will call him.
[701.12] Okay sir.
[704.00] Sir, have a seat.
[706.52] okay. Thank you. 
You’re welcome.
[724.88] Okay then you work on this
and do let me know.
[728.52] Right sir.
[729.52] And yes, the lawyer is here, 
send him to me.
[731.84] Right sir.
[732.56] Thank you. 
Thank you.
[740.32] Greetings sir.
[742.04] Greetings.
[743.12] Come, sir is calling you.
[745.00] Okay, thank you.
[754.16] Greetings, Mr Salman,
 how are you?
[757.00] Greetings, absolutely fine, 
how are you?
[758.44] Good, by the grace of God. 
Have a seat.
[759.76] thank you.
[760.80] Tell me, what will you have?
 Coffee or tea?
[763.36] Order whatever you like.
[766.20] Miss Tooba, send two cups of coffee.
[769.00] Right Sir. 
Thank you.
[771.92] So tell me, what is the progress?
[774.76] Mr Salman, the thing is you are 
the owner of this company right now
[778.68] but you staying in this position is 
in the control of Madam Arooj.
[785.24] What do you mean?
[790.36] My Dad has put in the attorney of 
this entire business under my name.
[793.68] No, no,
[794.92] look even your Dad is not 
the actual owner of it.
[798.60] How is that possible?
[800.24] He is the eldest in this house.
[803.24] Okay, so you just told me that
[805.28] Mr Waqar’s missing daughter 
has been found again?
[809.60] Yes, that’s how it is.
[811.88] okay, tell me all this business,
[814.92] property, bank balance was 
under whose name?
[819.84] His daughter’s.
[823.28] So then if she is present or 
if she comes back,
[828.44] she will be the actual owner.
[836.68] I mean, she is the lawful heir to it.
[842.72] And what if she doesn’t claim it?
[848.96] In that situation, you will have 
to get another attorney,
[856.32] and that too is up to Madam Arooj 
if she gives you the attorney or not.
[863.16] How is it possible?
[866.28] Mr Salman, this is the law,
 it’s not my fault.
[899.84] Your hollow talks,
[903.40] I will not believe them.
[905.72] But you will at least accept
[907.60] that I did all this for your better.
[909.84] I don’t want to hear this.
[912.12] My ears are fed up of listening to 
all these nonsensical things.
[915.40] These are not nonsensical things, 
this is the reality, son.
[919.04] So then what is the outcome 
of that reality?
[921.20] Is there any outcome?
[923.48] Zero.
[927.72] There is an outcome,
[930.84] now Salman is the sole owner 
of this entire property,
[936.12] this house, and this business, 
this is the result.
[944.00] Just for the sake of your good days,
[947.76] I controlled myself,
[949.64] had been patient,
[952.60] what else can a mother do?
[992.68] Now you understand how you were 
made the heir of the entire property
[996.76] and business after Arooj 
went missing?
[1009.44] I will go mad.
[1011.16] No.
[1012.84] You don’t have to get mad, 
you need to act very sanely.
[1019.32] Arooj is a very clever girl,
[1021.28] she is also the heir to the entire
business and property.
[1024.76] But she is my wife.
[1026.20] She is Mehreen’s daughter,
[1031.48] now that the reality is 
in front of you,
[1033.92] don’t expect anything good 
from Mehreen as well,
[1043.52] and Arooj will stand with her mother 
in this situation.
[1050.60] It means it will be famous in 
the entire city now
[1058.20] that Salman’s business belongs 
to his wife Arooj,
[1064.20] nothing belongs to Salman.
[1069.72] No,
[1072.56] I won’t let that happen at all.
[1206.52] Musarrat,
[1207.88] Musarrat, I told you I will solve 
all the problems,
[1210.68] yes,
[1212.08] okay I will talk to you later.
[1214.16] Boss, why is Madam Arooj here?
[1217.96] Arooj is here? 
Where is she?
[1220.56] She is talking to the staff
at the reception.
[1223.36] okay.
[1252.96] Hello? 
Salman,
[1255.44] Arooj has come to the office.
[1258.24] Arooj is here?
[1259.84] See how she started to spread 
her wings as soon as she came.
[1265.96] Okay, ask Nawaz to send her 
to my room.
[1294.32] Why has Arooj come all of a sudden?
[1301.44] Salman, your anger towards myself 
and Shaista is legit
[1306.44] but there is a huge reality that 
you aren’t aware of.
[1310.28] Oh okay,
[1312.44] so there is another reality that
[1314.92] still hasn’t been revealed to me?
[1316.56] You know according to the documents 
there is an Areej textile mill.
[1320.68] Yes, I know.
[1323.28] And you even asked me
[1325.24] who is this Areej that the textile mill 
is named after.
[1330.48] I did ask.
[1332.44] Did you get the answer?
[1335.44] None of you gave me an answer.
[1340.04] And do you also know that
[1342.12] Arooj’s parents are not her 
actual parents?
[1344.76] yes, I know that.
[1346.24] I was the one who helped Arooj 
in finding her parents.
[1349.80] There is no need for that.
[1353.56] Areej that you wanted to know
about is Arooj,
[1357.16] Mehreen's missing daughter.
[1403.08] Oh so I should come here daily, 
that is what you all want?
[1406.36] Madam, Mr Salman is calling you 
to his office.
[1409.76] Okay.
[1472.80] Mom,
[1477.72] I have felt peace on your face 
ever since Areej has come.
[1485.40] yes,
[1487.48] that’s exactly how it is.
[1490.28] Do you know Salman,
[1493.60] I feel that
[1497.00] I have a very deep and 
old bond with Areej,
[1513.76] but what is it?
[1569.72] Are you feeling peaceful?
[1574.88] yes, very peaceful.
[1582.36] Do you know Mom,
[1585.44] when I come to you,
[1588.76] I forget all my problems.
[1595.44] After all my son is my life.
[1606.88] My son is my life.
[1648.64] Did you see, Mehreen,
[1654.88] how I played the whole game 
and won too?
[1676.80] What did you win?
[1681.16] How I took my son back from you
[1684.92] that too with full profit.
[1693.96] My son Salman
[1698.08] is the sole owner of this entire 
property and business.
[1726.40] So you are accepting this yourself,
[1737.52] that you have done 
this disgusting act.
[1744.12] You will get an answer to this
[1753.56] when Salman will stay with me
[1756.36] and you will be left all alone.
[1767.32] I could have never thought
[1772.20] that someone could plan 
so mercilessly.
[1778.16] Please,
[1779.76] keep your dialogues to yourself.
[1789.76] By the way, to be honest,
[1792.52] I feel pity on you, Mehreen,
[1796.68] you have become so helpless.
[1850.80] Whatever you have done,
[1854.60] you were my mother-in-law 
at that time,
[1858.44] but now,
[1861.16] you are my mother.
[1869.76] Shall I tell you something?
[1873.40] Yes, tell me.
[1876.68] The day I found out 
you are my mother,
[1882.64] I just used to feel love 
looking at you
[1886.48] no matter how angry 
you would be with me.
[1891.32] So why didn’t you immediately tell me?
[1893.48] You should have told me right then, 
why didn’t you tell me?
[1898.52] I would have definitely told you, Mom,
[1907.40] but because of your mental health,
[1910.76] I had a fear in my heart,
[1913.44] God forbid something happens to you.
[2044.88] Why have you come here?
[2052.20] To meet you.
[2056.24] Why do you want to meet me?
