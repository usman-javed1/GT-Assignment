[78.76] Maybe you don’t know anything.
[84.20] What don’t I know?
[87.24] They are talking about little master’s
second marriage.
[95.68] Won’t you ask with whom?
[100.00] With whom?
[102.08] With madam Alizeh.
[198.00] Such a big decision is being 
made with regards to you
[200.84] and you are saying you are unaware.
[202.80] Arooj, I am not unaware.
[207.28] Neither am I unknowing.
[209.76] I just have not reached a decision, 
but I promise you,
[212.68] I will reach a decision soon.
[214.32] These things you are saying to avoid 
the question are worrying me.
[218.24] Answer my questions properly.
[220.00] I don’t have an answer.
[221.92] I don’t have an answer.
[248.84] Salman isn’t responding to properly 
on anything.
[257.28] His behaviour makes me feel like,
[262.68] gradually, he is saying no.
[269.20] He doesn’t have the courage 
to tell the truth,
[277.08] and the person who has made 
this decision is satisfied.
[293.08] Salman wont be able to tolerate 
the pressure from his mother for long.
[340.20] Oh wow, that’s a surprise.
[346.04] I feel my destination is not far now.
[350.32] Now, there is even distance between 
these Romeo and Juliet.
[354.76] Constant fire.
[357.12] Everything is on fire.
[420.56] It will not work like this Arooj.
[425.36] The sooner you accept this decision, 
it will be better for you.
[429.72] Your sorrow will reduce.
[432.88] There Salman is sitting in the lawn
[436.80] and he is lost in the smoke 
of his cigarette,
[442.20] and here you are staring at the sky.
[446.80] Whatever Salman is doing is 
on aunt Mehreen’s orders,
[451.80] he cannot ignore her decision.
[457.56] Aunt Mehreen told you this,
[461.84] not Salman.
[469.00] You are coaxing yourself like this,
[475.08] even though,
[477.72] the game is over.
[485.28] That is not true.
[490.00] The game is still left,
[493.88] and it will go till the last ball.
[497.40] I find your confidence funny.
[506.88] You are really stupid.
[562.92] Elder madam, should I serve breakfast?
[566.60] Where is Arooj.
[568.04] I had asked her, she refused to come.
[574.08] Salman,
[575.68] don’t you know why Arooj is not 
coming for breakfast?
[578.36] No, I don’t know.
[581.84] Why don’t you know?
[586.16] I don’t know the same way I didn’t know
that I getting married again.
[596.64] We have spoken on this topic earlier.
[599.28] Mom, we had just started talking,
[603.48] the conversation didn’t end.
[605.76] What do you want to say?
[607.12] I just want to say that I will end 
the thing you started.
[630.16] Wasai,
[632.48] go and call Arooj again and tell her 
that I am calling her.
[638.20] Sure.
[660.24] Come in.
[668.24] Little madam,
[670.36] elder madam is calling you 
for breakfast.
[681.28] Did you not tell aunty, 
that I don’t want to come?
[685.32] I told her, but…
[689.96] But?
[694.28] You bring my breakfast here 
on the table.
[697.08] I will not go downstairs 
and have breakfast.
[700.48] Why, younger madam?
[706.28] Because…
[711.56] because Alizeh is present there.
[715.48] So what will that do?
[719.08] Maybe nothing will happen,
[722.88] but I will be free from the feeling 
of mental torture.
[732.36] You tell aunty, 
that I don’t want to come.
[736.60] Sure.
[746.40] Little madam,
[752.28] you are my master,
[755.64] but it is your love that you never 
considered me a maid.
[762.44] My experience of the world is 
much more than you.
[768.04] If you want, I can give you an advice.
[773.60] Go ahead.
[775.80] Never leave your place empty.
[787.24] The game is over.
[790.24] The game is still left,
[792.88] and it will go till the last ball.
[798.64] I find your confidence funny.
[806.44] You are really stupid.
[814.48] You go ahead, I am coming.
[817.96] Okay.
[845.48] Elder madam, she is coming.
[848.84] Fine, Wasai, go serve breakfast.
[851.36] Okay.
[860.24] Arooj.
[870.36] Why were you not coming for breakfast?
[879.40] I am asking you something.
[882.32] Are you not aware of the methods 
of this home?
[888.04] Because on that dining table…
[894.92] in fact, maybe,
[897.68] there is no place for me 
in this home now.
[907.68] Who said this to you?
[911.96] Some things don’t need words.
[918.84] Alizeh’s presence in this home is 
making a lot of things obvious.
[957.68] Are you happy?
[962.72] Whatever is happening in this home 
is because of you.
[969.08] Along with Arooj, you have made 
all our lives difficult.
[977.56] I didn’t expect this from you.
[1033.12] Did you make Salman stand 
against my decision?
[1036.32] I didn’t say anything, aunty.
[1038.04] I am not ready to believe this at all.
[1040.00] Because my son was not like this.
[1042.48] I didn’t know how anyone was,
[1045.24] but yes,
[1046.48] the situation makes a person change.
[1049.08] and you created this situation.
[1052.48] I created the situation?
[1054.80] What have I done? 
What is my fault?
[1058.00] I am not doing anything, aunty.
[1059.80] Whatever is happening, 
you are doing it.
[1061.96] Everything is happening 
cause of you, Arooj.
[1065.76] You always blame me.
[1068.60] Today, you will have to tell me 
what my fault is.
[1072.72] If you had the capability 
to be a mother,
[1075.80] then I wouldn’t have had 
to do all this.
[1087.60] What happened?
[1089.72] Did I say something wrong?
[1095.24] No.
[1100.60] I cannot even call you wrong.
[1168.92] I am really sorry for you.
[1172.20] Obviously, the thing is so big.
[1174.44] But trust me Arooj,
I am not wrong here.
[1176.64] I have no fault here.
[1181.16] I am not even interested in Salman.
[1183.76] I have no interest in him.
[1188.36] Really?
[1190.48] Then you might be interested 
in his business and status.
[1197.88] Darling, I think you are forgetting
who I am.
[1202.84] I have come from America.
[1205.88] There are many much better 
than Salman there, you know?
[1212.40] Yes,
[1213.72] but all those people would know
[1217.04] your style and the way you target.
[1222.84] Arooj, you are insulting me now.
[1224.76] Because you deserve this.
[1234.36] If you try to ruin my home,
[1237.96] then you will never be happy in your life.
[1240.40] Hey, I don’t even want to stay happy.
[1243.28] I am not doing this for my happiness.
[1246.20] I am doing this for Salman and 
aunt Mehreen’s happiness.
[1252.88] I mean, it is for them, not for me.
[1259.52] I have to give them 
the happiness of a child,
[1266.36] something you couldn’t give them.
[1278.12] I just have to do it for them.
[1280.44] Please don’t consider me wrong.
[1283.96] Okay?
[1291.24] Arooj.
[1325.00] Man, I don’t know why mama is 
behaving with me like this.
[1327.92] She loves me so much, 
she agrees to everything I say.
[1331.20] But I don’t know what happens 
in Arooj’s case.
[1333.56] Mother in law. Mother in law,
my friend.
[1336.88] This is such a position, after getting it,
[1339.40] motherhood hides somewhere.
[1343.08] I agree to you, but she is my mother.
[1346.92] Will she still do all this?
[1348.96] Of course, she is your mother,
[1350.76] and she will also stay your mother,
[1352.40] but the emotions go to sleep in
the matters of the daughter in law.
[1356.92] You tell me, what is sister in law 
Arooj’s reaction,
[1360.12] after this adventure of aunt.
[1362.64] She is depressed.
[1364.08] She ought to be.
[1366.76] You send Alizeh away.
[1369.40] Here, your home is getting ruined and 
you are caring about friendship.
[1373.04] I wish I had done it earlier,
[1375.72] but I think it is late now.
[1378.80] Mama won’t let me send her away.
[1381.92] Hmmm.
[1385.60] You do one thing,
[1388.44] marry Alizeh.
[1394.28] Have you gone mad?
[1397.16] I will never do this.
[1423.44] I am worried cause of this suffocation.
[1429.36] All of them have me standing 
on the guillotine,
[1440.00] but they are not announcing me 
to be hanged.
[1446.96] It is becoming difficult for me 
to breathe in this home.
[1456.28] I don’t find any ray of hope.
[1465.48] I will have to do something.
[1483.36] You don’t sit here,
[1485.92] come and sit here.
[1487.92] This is Arooj and this is Salman’s chair.
[1492.28] She is not a guest anymore 
sister in law.
[1494.72] She is going to be a member 
of this family.
[1502.64] I have asked her to sit here.
[1506.08] Sit, please.
[1513.16] Thank you.
[1515.24] Oh wow,
[1517.24] you were hasty in becoming 
a host from guest.
[1522.24] Bravo.
[1523.16] Thank you, aunt.
[1526.68] Sister in law, please,
[1529.12] she is Salman’s future wife.
[1531.64] So please, respect her.
[1539.68] She is his future wife, she has still 
not become his wife.
[1544.20] It will take her time to become his wife.
[1547.84] After all, Arooj is coming, 
she won’t like it.
[1553.04] You people can wait till then, right?
[1563.96] Madam.
[1566.44] Little madam is not in her room.
[1569.24] If she is not in her room,
[1571.48] then she must be in the lounge 
or garden.
[1574.28] No, no, madam.
[1575.72] I have seen every corner of the home,
[1578.36] she is nowhere.
[1579.96] The guard was telling me 
he saw her going out.
[1592.04] Madam,
[1593.56] even her phone is kept in her room.
[1604.56] Alizeh, have food. 
Sure.
[1668.44] Salman.
[1669.96] Hello.
[1670.84] Mama, I have been calling you for so long,
 why are you not answering my call?
[1674.48] Salman, is everything okay? 
You sound a little worried.
[1678.40] I called Arooj so many times, 
her phone is off. Where is she?
[1682.44] Thank God, Salman, you are fine.
[1685.44] Please, don’t talk like this. 
I get scared.
[1690.64] This worry of yours will take 
my life one day.
[1694.76] Mama, I am asking you a question 
for so long, why are you not answering?
[1698.32] Where is Arooj? Why is her phone off?
[1700.72] How would I know why her phone is off?
[1704.76] And where is she herself?
[1706.08] I don’t know son,
[1707.72] she went out of the home 
without informing me.
[1711.68] She went out.
[1714.12] Where did she go?
[1716.04] I am telling you Salman,
[1717.68] she left the house without 
informing me.
[1739.40] Arooj has made my life hell.
[1743.84] Now she has worried Salman again.
[1817.20] Hello.
[1818.24] Salman, son, where are you?
[1820.64] Arooj is not at home. 
She left somewhere.
[1823.80] Yes, aunt, I am looking for her.
[1826.24] But where did she go? 
I am unable to find her.
[1828.36] Maybe she went to her parents home.
[1832.04] that’s what I think.
[1834.16] Now the situation of home has 
really become intolerable for Arooj.
[1839.36] Don’t get me started about 
the environment of the home.
[1843.52] Yes, you are right about that.
[1845.60] So, son do one thing.
[1847.72] Yes, tell me.
[1849.44] You won’t tell anything 
to Arooj’s parents,
[1851.60] those poor people will get worried 
for no reason.
[1853.44] Yes, aunt, after all 
what will they think?
[1857.20] I married Arooj 
after so much insistence,
[1860.16] and now what is all this 
that is happening?
[1863.24] There is nothing like that.
[1865.28] You don’t blame yourself, son 
and don’t worry yourself either.
[1868.88] Arooj will come back soon.
[1873.56] Okay, son.
[1879.84] Where have you gone, Arooj?
[1888.88] Where has this girl gone?
[1890.44] How can she leave without 
informing like this?
[1935.20] Aunt,
[1937.80] did you find out something about Arooj?
[1944.60] No.
[1946.92] Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
[1949.84] Poor thing.
[1965.08] Aunt,
[1970.60] is everything okay?
[1972.88] Why are you looking at me like that?
[1977.24] The day I had seen you being
so frank with Salman,
[1984.80] I had my doubts
[1987.20] that it is you who will spread poison
in Salman and Arooj’s life.
[1992.12] What is wrong, aunt?
[1995.00] All that you are seeing, 
whatever that is happening,
[2003.56] is being done on aunt Mehreen’s directive,
it is as per her wish.
[2007.28] No,
[2009.16] my eyes cannot be deceived.
[2013.52] You are behind all this.
[2016.16] Because of you, Arooj left this home
and went.
[2019.44] Aunt, what is wrong?
[2022.68] Why are you blaming poor me?
[2025.88] That too without a reason.
[2027.96] It is surely a blame,
[2030.32] but it is not without a reason.
[2035.96] Anyway,
[2037.56] I don’t want to talk to you on this topic.
[2040.84] Right now, Arooj is important for me.
[2045.40] Hey. Hey. Hey. Aunt.
[2052.52] Poor, aunt.
[2129.24] Do you even care?
[2131.12] The whole day has passed
[2133.20] and Arooj still hasn’t come back home.
[2137.04] What is there to worry 
in this sister in law?
[2140.24] It is possible that she went 
to her mother’s home.
[2146.60] Yes, it is possible.
[2149.68] But if this doesn’t happen, then?
[2152.84] So sister in law, what can I do?
[2155.32] She is not a child.
[2158.20] I wish you were the mother 
of a daughter,
[2160.20] then you would have understood 
the sorrow of a daughter.
[2164.08] The mother of a daughter?
[2167.40] Even you are not a mother.
[2169.92] In fact, you are not a mother.
[2174.52] I still gave birth to Salman,
[2177.68] that is why, please sister in law,
[2179.80] don’t give me a lecture 
on feeling this pain.
[2183.16] Salman.
[2191.44] Yes.
[2195.20] You have Salman.
[2200.84] But Mehreen,
[2202.76] every woman has motherhood 
inside her,
[2205.84] whether she has a child or not.
[2210.84] Maybe you are not aware of 
the motherhood hidden inside me.
[2217.44] Pray that you never find out about it,
either.
[2245.88] She was telling me 
what a mother is.
