Urooj. Yes, aunty? Salman, see Urooj is present here. I want to ask you something 
in her presence. Mom, what is the matter? Do I have no right to become 
a grandmother? Why are you saying this? Because, I don’t see any signs. Why do you worry, aunty? When God wants, you will surely 
become a grandmother. I feel you cannot even become a mother. Mom, what are you saying? Really? You didn’t like what I said? Then fine, you get Urooj’s medical test done. I want to see my grandson in my arms 
once, I want to play with him. Do you hear me? 
This is my final decision. Mom. Salman. I don’t understand one thing. What? Sometimes aunt Mehreen gets 
after things like a child. Mama is like that from the start. I don’t understand, how did she suddenly think about me 
becoming a mother. She can get any thought at any time. Yes, but, we just got married seven months ago. I feel she wishes to be a 
grandmother soon. That is fine, but when God wills, it will happen. You are right. When God wills. Then why does aunty want 
to get my test done? When something gets into mama’s head, it gets stuck. Should I tell you something? The child that comes in the world will be the second child of our family, 
after me. Urooj. I wanted to say something. Look, if you ever have any doubts 
related to your health, then please get your tests done, okay?
Get your tests done on time. What do you want to say? I just want to say that just be 
very careful, please. I have faith in my God, that is why I have no fear in my heart. I am just saying it for your betterment, 
Urooj. I really want that you have a child,
you become a mother. I have no other interest. Anyway, take care of yourself. Why is she worried about 
my health so much? What is going on in her head? Shall we go?
Yes. Listen, can you drop me to mom’s home 
on our way back from the lab. If you don’t mind. What is there to mind in this?
I will drop you. Thank you. Actually, I am never sure of your mood. I am a little scared to talk to you. So this means, I am rude. This will surely spoil my mood. Salman, please, I didn’t mean that. I just said it. Okay, I am sorry. Salman. I was joking. Salman, you are really bad. Don’t worry, I will drop you. Shall we go?
Yes. Let’s go. By the way, which one of you wants 
to have the test? Look, neither one of us 
wishes to get it done, actually this is my mother’s wish. We are sitting here to do the test. But I think it is too early. So you mean that not having a pregnancy in seven months 
is nothing abnormal? Yes, absolutely. Nothing abnormal. Okay you come with me. Hey, wow, child, suddenly like this. Greetings. 
Greetings. Greetings. Come. Come. 
Where are you two coming from? Uncle, I took Urooj to the doctor. Why child? All okay? Yes, papa, it is all fine. I just went for a checkup. Okay. Okay. Come. Come. Naseema. Hey, Naseema. Is all okay? Tell me, what is the news? There is no news, mama and 
aunty wants a news. What does she say? She wants to play with her grandchildren. Okay. That is why she sent you 
to get a test done. Mama, nothing will happen, right? 
I am really scared. Urooj, child, have faith in God, 
everything will be fine. Pray for me. Sure my child. Okay, you go sit with Salman, 
I will bring tea. Go. Salman is really business minded, he made his business flourish. Master, may God keep my daughter 
happy and content. But I am really worried because of her. She was really scared. Hey, this is routine matter, what difference does a test make? But, Urooj’s mother in law is a 
really stubborn woman. What difference does that make? 
She can be stubborn. I just have a doubt, what is something is not right, then? Urooj’s life… Hey, nothing will happen to Urooj’s life, have faith in God. Come on, rest. Here you go. Thank you. How was your day today? 
Was everything fine? It was fine. All day long I had a few meetings, 
so we were discussing on it. Salman, you went to the lab too,
 today. So what happened? Yes, we went. In fact, we even met the doctor, 
the test got done. Hmmm. Till when will the reports come? I think they will be here 
in twenty four hours. Twenty four hours? You get them online in the US. Here I have heard you first have to 
get a slip made, then there are a print outs, 
it is a really long procedure. Yes, but you even get the result 
online over here, it is just that mostly people prefer that 
they have a slip or a print out. Hmmm. Show me the slip. Huh? Show me the slip. I just want 
to see how it is made here. Okay, just a second. Here you go. Urooj, don’t stress out, it will all be fine. Here you go. Thank you. When the reports come, please share them with me as well. Urooj, don’t worry. Salman is right. Everything will be fine.
Okay? Salman, what was the need 
to give her the slip? Urooj, what could I do?
She had asked for it. She shouldn’t have asked for it. Okay, come on, you don’t worry. 
Why are we worried? The result will be okay. 
Everything will be fine. Come with me, quickly. Open it here. Be quick Wasai. Yes, yes, madam, 
I am unpacking it. How did you like all this, Urooj? It is good. Wasai, you have to set all these toys 
in the entire room and yes, the pictures 
I have sent for framing, as soon as they come, you have to put them
 in front of madam Urooj on the bed. Urooj, whenever you get up 
and see those pictures, you will see, really beautiful children
 will be born. Yes, I have also heard the same. and Wasai, all these toys should be cleaned daily. I shouldn’t get to see any mistakes. Yes, yes, madam, I understand. 
Don’t worry. Urooj, how did you like it? It is good, but there is no one to play with 
these toys right now. Hey, we will get the news today, 
so think that a baby will be in this home. Then you are giving me 
good news, right? I think you have some misunderstanding. The test you got done for me,
it doesn’t mean that. It is to check if I can become 
a mother or not. Now don’t confuse me with these 
difficult things. Understand? I know well what I have to do and 
what I don’t have to do. You stay quiet. 
Be completely quiet. Wasai, you have to set all these toys
in the room. Understand? There should be no mistake. Yes, elder madam, don’t worry. What you have said will happen. Little madam, don’t be sad. God will be kind and very soon 
you will get to hear a good news. Salman’s friend Alizay came home
suddenly and then she stayed too. They have such close friendship? I don’t think all this is right. I don’t think this is right, but maybe we are mistaken. It is possible we are thinking wrong. I don’t know why my heart is 
so worried today, like something is going to happen. Something big. Alizay coming to this home. At least it is not good for Urooj 
in any way. Wasai, you have to set all these toys 
in the entire room and yes, the pictures 
I have sent for framing, as soon as they come, you have to put them in front 
of madam Urooj on the bed. Urooj, whenever you get up and
 see those pictures, you will see, really beautiful children 
will be born. Then you are giving me 
good news, right? I think you have some misunderstanding. The test you got done for me,
it doesn’t mean that. It is to check if I can become
a mother or not. Now don’t confuse me with these 
difficult things. Understand? I know well what I have to do and 
what I don’t have to do. You stay quiet. Be completely quiet. Come in. Little madam, madam Shanzay has come. I have seated her 
in the drawing room. Fine, I will come. Sure, madam. In fact, listen, Wasai. Yes, madam? You bring her to my room. Fine, little madam, I will bring her. Come in. Greetings. 
Greetings. This is a slip for your lab. Yes, absolutely, this is a slip 
from our lab, but you will get this report 
in the evening. Doctor, I didn’t come to collect 
the reports from you. I came to talk to you about 
something important. Look, I don’t like beating 
about the bush, I am very straight forward. Okay, then go ahead. Have a seat. Thank you. Doctor, I wanted to talk to you that you change these reports 
as per my liking. and what is your liking? Doctor, you just have to mention
in the reports, that Urooj can never be a mother. Making changes in the reports
is a crime. It is a crime. And I cannot do this. Only you can do this. You will do my work, 
and I will do your work. And you know, doctor, this is how the world operates. Give some, take some. Okay, but what is your benefit in this? Come. Oh wow, Urooj. All this? This means that I am going 
to become an aunt? There is nothing like that. If there is nothing like that, 
then why all this? Look Urooj, you can tell me, 
you will not get my evil eye. What are you saying, man? Why would I hide anything from you? All this is happening because of 
aunt Mehreen. Then, why all this? She got my medical test done, to find out if I can be a mother or not? But, I don’t understand she has made 
the environment of the home so intense, as if the test has been done to check 
if I am pregnant or not. Although the test has been conducted 
to see if I can be a mother or not. I don’t understand anything, Shanzay. Oh my God, this means that she is thinking 
this is a pregnancy report, and that is why all these toys are here? Yes, you understand it correctly. She does what she thinks and no one in the home can even
try to prove her wrong. Leave it. I will ask Wasai to bring tea for you. Sure. Have something, buddy. Man, I will just have tea 
in a little while. Okay listen. 
Yes? I wanted to talk to you about something. Tell me, I came to talk to you 
after so long. A friend of Salman, Alizay, has come 
to live in the home, from America. You are telling me something 
so important now? There is nothing special about it. Really? How is she? She is good. She is pretty. She is modern and blunt as well. Then it seems dangerous to me. Come on, nothing like that. If there is nothing like that, Urooj, then why are you talking about that 
poor thing, making such a bad face? Because you know 
I never like such girls. What girls? I mean, she came from America, 
that’s how everyone is. And how long will she stay? No idea. Anyway, leave it. Have tea. 
Yes. It is getting cold. Hello. Greetings. 
Greetings. How are you? I am sure, you are Alizay. Shanzay, this is Alizay and Alizay, 
this is Shanzay, my best friend. Uh-huh. Nice to meet you Shanzay. Same here. 
Come, sit with us. No, no, thank you. I would have surely sat, 
but I have a headache, so I will rest. Okay? By the way, Urooj make me a cup of coffee, 
please. I will ask Wasai. Wasai doesn’t know 
how to make coffee, so you make it. I am busy right now, my friend is over, and it will not be possible for me. Did you see? Yes, I saw everything and 
also understood it too. Now you don’t have to tell me
anything about this madam, I will tell you everything. Urooj, what sort of a girl are you? What happened aunty? Don’t you guests in your home? Did your mother not teach you 
how to take care of guests? Alizay is Salman’s friend and you said no to giving her coffee? Aunty, Wasai was at home, but Alizay said no…
So, you should have made it. I was sitting with my friend. Okay, your friend is important, but my Salman’s friend is not important? Now I cannot give you any answer 
for this question. Look Urooj, Alizay is a guest and Salman’s friend, in future, you shouldn’t make such a 
mistake or else I will not forgive you. So you have thought that you will prove through the reports 
that Urooj cannot be a mother. Of course, that’s how it is. But all this would be temporary, right? Meaning? Meaning that Urooj can be 
a mother at any time. Maybe next week. So you are afraid that if you do this, then your lab’s report will be spoiled? No, there is nothing like that. I am just trying to make you understand that the value of the reports 
is just a piece of paper. In reality, Urooj can be a mother. Then you tell me, doctor, what should we do in such a situation? I will prescribe a medication to you, you will have to give that medication
to Urooj once in the week. Till she keeps on taking 
that medication, there will be no chances of pregnancy. This completes your work, and my work? Hmmm. Tell me your account number, doctor. Sent. Please check your phone. Good. Very good. How is this girl making the people 
of the home her own and turning everyone against me. She is really cunning. She has gotten an idea that aunt Mehreen’s
 behaviour towards me is not good at all, and she knows this is my weak point, from where she wants to start this game. Hello. You were absolutely right, Shanzay. What happened, Urooj? Alizay has found out aunt’s behavior 
towards me, and that is why she is creating 
differences between us. So, she wants to cause you a big harm 
through aunt Mehreen’s help. and you know, Salman considers Alizay really bold 
and straight forward girl. Man, that girl is a straight fire. But, what is the reason behind her 
doing all this? Her target is brother Salman. Salman has no such thing 
for Alizay in his heart. But she is trying that according 
to the things you are telling me. So then what should I do? Urooj, keep your eyes and ears open. At times when you cannot call love, love, then you have to give it some 
other name and love. Fine, I will call you later. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye.
