Look Mehreen, I have brought Arooj’s matter to you 
for the last time. Because I have had enough. I cannot see the destruction of this home,
 and Salman’s worry. Okay brother Idrees, 
you please sit comfortably. We will sit and talk. What can I say to you? What do I say about 
my son’s stupidity? Salman had decided to be ruined 
that day when he decided to make a girl 
like Arooj has his wife. Mehreen, when you know everything, 
when you agree to everything, then? I don’t know what family this girl is from, 
what sort of blood she have, or else the children of good parents 
don’t behave this way at all. Arooj’s intention is just to
 get Salman’s wealth, and to reach it, 
she is making moves. I am tired of this Arooj, 
but what do I do about Salman? Salman is obedient to you. If you order him to do something, it is not possible that 
he will not obey it. And if you ask me honestly, Mehreen, then Waqar’s face comes 
in front of my eyes. Like he is telling me that brother, after I died you couldn’t save my wife and 
my son, Salman, from sorrow. My heart starts to explode. Ammad, I don’t understand 
what I should do. Arooj, what is there not 
to understand in this? Your marriage is on the line 
because of this situation and you still are thinking ten times 
before deciding. Come on, man. I don’t understand Ammad, that are we facing a bigger loss 
hiding this, or will we face a bigger loss 
by telling this. Of course hiding it. Your life has been ruined a lot, 
even though you have no fault in this. It is the fault of that Mr. Idrees, who got married and hid it. Who pointed fingers at your life, and distanced you from Salman. And you are having a hard time 
decided against him? Can I ask you what this difficulty is? There is a difficulty, Ammad. It is difficult. When you have to save your home
from a storm, then you face a lot of difficulties. Uncle is the elder of this home, his respect will be tarnished, 
that is the difficulty. Aunt loves me so much, she will have nothing left. 
That is the difficulty. And Salman? He will lose his faith from 
the entire family. That’s the difficulty. 
He will break and I love him a lot. I will not be able to see him like this. Fine, when you know everything, 
then why are you asking me? Then whose advice should I take? And you want that I become selfish, maybe I will never be able to become that.
I am sorry. Arooj. Arooj, you know Salman doesn’t like 
you meeting Ammad. Then why do you meet him? Why should I not meet him? I have nothing to hide, aunt. You are right. But child, your life cannot 
pass like this. I don’t even want to pass life like this, I want to live my life. How will you live happily? How will you live, when your life partner is not happy? Brother Idrees, please get 
a grip on yourself. You will get unwell this way. Here, the respect of the home 
is getting tarnished. You leave my health, think about 
the respect of the home. You know everything Mehreen. You will say that Arooj is the root of this entire issue? So why don’t you cut this root? Bring peace in Salman’s life, 
tell him to get rid of Arooj. If the mother in law had this right, then I would have made this decision 
a long time back. But Salman has to make this decision. Mehreen, we will have to think 
beyond ifs and buts. Force him to make the decision. Now do you need any more proof 
after seeing that picture? If you cannot make him decide, 
then tell me, I will talk to him strictly. How long will be tolerate 
Arooj’s stubbornness? I cannot see his condition. My child,
my heart worries seeing him. No, no, brother Idrees, 
you won’t talk to Salman. He is my son, I will talk to him. I will make him understand. But please, you get a grip 
on yourself. I will just come. 
You please… Arooj. Arooj. If it was in my control, 
I would kill this girl. She ruined the environment 
of our home. Enough. What sort of a woman is this Mehreen? She is not talking herself and neither is she letting me talk. I have to explain everything to her 
from the start and push her. She gets angry and says that I will do this, I will do that, and when the time to decide comes, she says no. Whatever is to be done, 
will be done by Salman. What are you looking at, aunt? This is a picture of our wedding 
anniversary. See, your uncle is even handsome today. I love him to bits. But child, I am worried for you. If I tell you honestly, if I don’t speak to your uncle, and even an hour passes, 
then I don’t find peace. You love uncle so much? The truth is, Idrees really loves me. I shouldn’t tell anything to aunt. Her heart will break. What are you thinking, child? I am proud of your love, that you love uncle so much. Why did you come to my room? Wont you ask me to sit, today? Talk about whatever you want 
to quickly, I am busy. Okay fine, I will increase your work a little more. Check this file. What is in this file? See for yourself. Okay, I will tell you. Corruption of ten million 
in Sasa builder project. Wow. Five million commission in 
Multinational Advertising. Very nice. And the weirdest corruption 
that I didn’t understand. Maybe you can help me in this. Stone bury marble costed sixty four hundred thousand, but that is not the important thing. The important thing is 
where that marble went? There is no record, no data, where did that marble go? I feel your heart is sinking. Will you still not ask me to sit? Have a seat. Thank you. It is ringing, but Idrees is not
 answering the call. God be kind. Madam, it is possible elder sir is busy 
somewhere. It is really late, now Wasai. What is he busy with? He can send a two word message. madam, he must have a lot of work
 in the office. No, no, it is ringing constantly, but Idrees is not answering his phone. It is not possible that Idrees wouldn’t know I am calling. Idrees, answer the phone. My heart is so worried. Why is he not answering my phone? No, no, madam, you don’t worry. God will make it all fine. Yes, fine, you leave. Leave me alone. Sure, madam. Why is he not attending the call? Idrees answer the phone. He is not answering my message? Where are you Idrees? Why are you not picking up my phone? Answer me. Idrees has made my life hell. Answer the phone Idrees. Mama, I want a burger, 
I am hungry. From where do I order it from? 
I don’t have money. Then you call, papa. I was calling him, he is not answering. Call him again. I want to have a burger and that’s it. Answer the phone, uncle. It feels like you are getting 
a call from two places. I will answer it, it is my issue. By the way, you have two numbers, right? No, I have just one number. Oh, there must be a lot of confusion then. When the first one calls, you must 
take the name of the second and when the second calls you, 
you would take the name of the first. What do you want? You are really worried 
by my questions. I am surprised. The one who answers 
the whole world has no answer for me today. I know what you know. But now I want to know 
what you want from me. Deal. What sort of deal? You will do what I tell you to do. What will you say? 
And what will I have to do? Good, meaning you are ready 
for the deal. If I say no, then? You don’t have the option to say no. Think about it, it is up to you. What have I done to you? You have done a lot to me. And you know what you have 
done calls for revenge. Now you will take revenge 
from me? Nope. I leave that on you too. If you agree to me, then that’s it. Then you won’t take revenge? Nice, your statement has your 
acceptance of crime. Answer me. If you agree to me, then I will tell the revenge to… Hello. This is Mrs. Idrees. Yes, madam. Is Mr. Idrees in the office? Yes, he is in the office. Is he really busy. No madam, I don’t know about this but right now Mr. Idrees is in a meeting
with madam Arooj. Arooj has come? Yes, madam, if you have a message,
then you tell me. I will give it to sir. No. No. I will call him myself. Thanks. Okay madam, thank you. What is Arooj doing in Idrees’ office. What happened, Muqadas? 
Who was on the phone? Sir Idrees’ wife called. So? What was she saying? Man, I felt she was taking a confirmation. Hmm. Leave it man, big people, big talks. 
You are right. You give this file to the accounts. 
Sure, don’t worry. Madam Arooj is here at this hour. There is no meeting in the 
meeting calendar either. She also has a file in her hand. What did she come here for? Is Mr. Idrees in the office? Yes, he is in the office. Is he really busy. No madam, I don’t know about this but right now Mr. Idrees is in a 
meeting with madam Arooj. Arooj has come? Yes, madam, if you have a message, 
then you tell me. I will give it to sir. Idrees doesn’t even like hearing 
Arooj’s name, then why did Arooj go to meet 
Idrees in his office. If there was something, they could have
also talked about it at home. Arooj is hiding something from me. But Arooj doesn’t hide anything 
from me. It is possible she doesn’t want 
Mehreen finding out. Whatever it is, it is really shocking for Idrees. That is why he is not answering
 my phone. You will do what I tell you to do. What will you say? 
And what will I have to do? Good, meaning you are ready for the deal. If I say no, then? You don’t have the option to say no. Think about it, it is up to you. You have done a lot to me. And you know what you have 
done calls for revenge. Arooj, you? Here? In this office? Is everything okay? Why? Do I need your permission 
to come to the office? Yes, you should. But anyway, if you are here, 
then tell me, what is the matter? Have a seat. I... I want to share an important file 
with you. What file? Show me. But first listen to me. What is it? Tell me. Whatever is in this file, you will accept it as it is and you will not ask any question 
in this regards. Anything else? and you will not say no 
about anything to me. Arooj, I am the CEO of this company, all decisions here are made under me. I know. I am making a special request to you. Okay, show me the file. 
Let me see. Now you listen to me carefully. I want to talk to you about aunt. Aunt Shaista. She really loves you. For her sake, I will let this secret remain a secret. Second thing, Salman. You will not make Salman face 
any sort of financial loss and I am doing this for Salman 
and not for you. Because he really respects you. I hope you will be obedient to this. Or else, I have all the proof with me. What are you thinking?
Huh? Nothing at all. Okay tell me something, what is the reason for blessing 
uncle so much. What did he do? You have promised me Salman that you will not ask me 
any questions. Okay fine, I won’t ask. Here you go. Thank you. You are welcome. What sort of a girl is she? Uncle is against her and she came to get his salary increased. Arooj, it is so difficult to make a 
decision against you. Now you will take revenge from me? I leave that on you too. If you agree to me, then that’s it. Then you won’t take revenge? Nice, your statement has your 
acceptance of crime. Sir, I knew madam Arooj came 
suddenly, there must be something special. What is special? What did you find out? I just found out, and you know everything 
got done well. I was not even mentioned. Nawaz, what happened now? Your salary has increased, boss. Salary increased, meaning? Madam Arooj, asked Mr. Salman 
and had your salary increased. You know sir, this calls for lunch 
for the entire staff on this. Okay fine, don’t become a pain all the time.
Go, right now. Leave. Okay, sir. Arooj started working 
on the deal so soon.
