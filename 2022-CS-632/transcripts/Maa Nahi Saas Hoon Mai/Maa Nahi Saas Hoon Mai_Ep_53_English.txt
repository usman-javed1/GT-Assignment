Naseema, what is the matter? Why are you worried? Master, why has my Arooj 
not come till now? Now you start imaging that Arooj is not coming. When she has said she will come, 
she will surely come. My heart is really weird. 
I feel that I am waiting for a guest. When daughters get married, 
they come like guests. They stay for a while and leave. So, she should come at least. There, our Arooj is here. Arooj. Arooj, what happened, child? Is everything fine? You are fine, right? Did Mehreen say something? Did you fight with Salman? What happened, child? 
What happened? Papa… What happened? Okay come on, come inside. 
Come inside. No issues, child. What happened? 
Tell us. Come on. Come on. What is the issue, Arooj, child? Will you continue to cry or will you tell us something, as well? Today, I don’t have to tell you anything. I have to ask. Why did you two hide such 
a big truth from me? What truth? That I am not the daughter 
of both of you. The silence of both of you tells me that whatever I heard from both of you
that day is true. Why did you do this? Tell me. How could we tell you, child? We had forgotten ourselves that 
you are not our daughter. You are lying. Lies! I wish you had forgotten this, then it wouldn’t have reached me. But now it has reached me. You have found out now, so tell me, are you not our daughter? Arooj, will you not call me ‘mama’ now? I cannot even think that. You are my mama, 
and you are my papa. Yes, we are your parents. Then, what are you sad about? I am just sad about being separated 
from unseen relations. Where are you going? I am going to find out, 
who am I? whose daughter am I? 
Who gave birth to me? Who separated me from my parents? What is my identity? 
Who am I? I am going to find the answers 
for all these questions. Stop her. Master, 
you please go stop her. Where will she go? 
Where will she find her parents? We couldn’t find her parents then, now twenty-five years have passed. Naseema, you were right. I found a child. See, I had told you I could hear 
some child cry. Why did you find this child from? Hey, they were lying in the branches. In the branches? Master, what sort of parents are these? Master, what will we do with this child? We will go to the police station, we will handover this child to them. No, no, first we will take them home. God know how long they would be
 hungry for. Yes, you are right. See, how they became quiet 
coming in my arms. My child, people become enemies. Tell me, why are you jumping in a fire 
started by someone else? Mama, you can also put out the fire. Okay, you go and change your clothes. I will go make a cold drink for you. And yes, today I am making my doll’s 
favourite biryani today. Oh wow, it will be a lot of fun then. Where is papa?
I don’t see him. He went out for some work, 
he said he will come late. You are your own enemy. My son, Salman, a big man made you
 part of his life and you… you showed him your true colours. True colours? Really? What true colours did I show? I should also find out. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything. One cannot talk to a girl like you. In fact, their mothers are cursed, who have given birth to girls like you. Don’t say anything about my mother. That’s why I am saying that 
I don’t want to say anything. Because it is girls like you who give people the opportunity 
to point fingers at their mothers. Go from here, now. Leave. Arooj, tea. You seem to be in a big shock to me. Yes, the shock is really big. Arooj, your parent’s shock is way bigger
 than your shock. You have stepped out to search 
for your real parents, they have lost their daughter. I have no complaints from them. I am still their daughter. You were their daughter till the time you didn’t know the difference
 between your own and strangers. But I have no complaints from them. They are my well-wishers. But I don’t know I have a weird confusion in my heart. What confusion, Arooj? On one hand this heart is stuck 
in the love of my mama and papa, and on the other hand the shock of being separated from 
my real parents is not leaving this heart. Look, I agree with you, but what can you do? I will find my parents. Arooj, how will you find your parents? I don’t understand this, that from where do I start 
the journey of this search. I think first you should talk to your parents 
about your past. That’s only when you can find out. Hello. Arooj, you are really brave. 
You are really consistent. You will have to get a grip 
on yourself bravely. Yes, I am trying. Arooj, I have only seen this in films. Look, none of us has any experience. But still as your friend, I can only encourage you. Thank you, but no one’s words give me peace now, and now nothing anyone says 
can heal my heart. Arooj, those whose parents die in childhood, they tolerate the injustice of 
their step relations. You have been brought up 
with a lot of love. The biggest sorrow is that I don’t know who my real relations are, where are they and I have to find them. Anyway, I am always with you. Whenever you need me, 
please, let me know. Just pray for me. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye. Why did you two hide such 
a big truth from me? What truth? The silence of both of you tells me that whatever I heard from both of you 
that day is true. Why did you do this? Tell me. How could we tell you, child? We had forgotten ourselves that 
you are not our daughter. You are lying. Lies! I wish you had forgotten this, then it wouldn’t have reached me. But now it has reached me. What are you thinking, Master? I am thinking, Naseema, how relations change in moments. I too feel the same way that we are left with nothing. Don’t say that. Arooj will never leave us and go. Even if she finds her parents. Now what are you thinking? I am thinking that if Arooj’s mother in law, Mehreen, 
finds out about all this, then she will make her life hell.
Master. You are right. This way, Arooj’s position 
will be questioned. Okay, then you do one thing,
 you call Arooj. Hello. 
Hello. Yes, mama? Child I wanted to give you an advice. Go ahead. Don’t let anyone in your in-laws find out
 about all this. What if you have to face more difficulties. Yes, better. Okay, take care of yourself. 
Goodbye. Goodbye. You have your tea. Salman. Yes, mom? Do you know where Arooj went? Yes, she went to her parent’s home. Why don’t you say she went 
to her mother’s home? It is the same thing, mom. It is not the same thing. The mothers of such girls 
are really cunning. They turn them against their in-laws and Naseema is one of them. I feel those two have some problems
 with each other. Arooj is upset with her mother. Really? If this is true, then it is really good. But this is not true. Because this is some move of this girl
to keep us in the dark. What move can it be? There must simply be some differences 
between the mother and daughter. You should have an idea now. The girl who can have differences
with her real mother, she can be upset with her, what sort of behavior will she have 
with your mother. Mom, I don’t think the way you think. You are back. Did you make truce with your mother? Or did you call her mad too? Did you see, Salman how she ignored your mother and 
didn’t reply to anything she said. Is this girl upset with her mother 
or is she upset with the entire world? In this home, the youngsters 
are becoming the elder. I don’t understand this. Why did you not answer mom? Is it necessary to answer everything? Yes, but still… What still, Salman? Aunty anyway says a lot, and I never get upset on 
anything she says. Being upset reminds me, you were 
upset with your mother? There is nothing like that. There was something, Arooj. Why do you get after one thing? Because your behavior is extra ordinary. You have never done this till today, 
do I not know you? So what do you know? You don’t know anything. This means there is something 
that I don’t know. Hah, if you find out something,
then do tell me too. I am searching for it. In fact, I am the one who is at 
the greatest loss in this. How is that? My Arooj has gotten lost somewhere 
in this queue of questions. I don’t know, has she gotten lost or was she lost? Do you know where Arooj went? Yes, she went to her parent’s home. Why don’t you say she went 
to her mother’s home? It is the same thing, mom. It is not the same thing. The mothers of such girls 
are really cunning. They turn them against their in-laws and Naseema is one of them. I feel those two have some 
problems with each other. Arooj is upset with her mother. Really? If this is true, then it is really good. But this is not true. Because this is some move of this girl
 to keep us in the dark. What move can it be? There must simply be some differences
between the mother and daughter. This Arooj is trying to act really smart. She is hiding something. A person hides the thing that is a cause of embarrassment 
for them. I will find out what is going on between Arooj 
and her mother. You are really deep, Arooj. But my name is also Mehreen. You will tell me yourself. Wasai. Yes, elder madam? You go around madam Arooj a lot. No, elder madam. You are mistaken. I serve everyone. Hmmm. By the way, Wasai, who does madam Arooj talk to 
on the phone and what does she talk about? You must have heard it some time. No, no, I never heard anything. Hmmm. Okay. But you must know what Mr. Salman 
and madam Arooj talk about. What do they talk about? Madam, we are servants, our eyes and ears are closed. Okay, okay, fine. Don’t talk too much and 
go from here. I wish you had forgotten this, then it wouldn’t have reached me. But now it has reached me. You have found out now, so tell me, are you not our daughter? Arooj, will you not call me ‘mama’ now? I cannot even think that. You are my mama, 
and you are my papa. Yes, we are your parents. Then, what are you sad about? You seem to be in a big shock to me. Yes, the shock is really big. Arooj, your parents’ shock is 
way bigger than your shock. You have stepped out to search 
for your real parents, they have lost their daughter. I have no complaints from them. I am still their daughter. You were their daughter till the time you didn’t know the difference
between your own and strangers. Mother. My mother. Where are you? Where do I look for you? How do I find you? I want to meet you. I just want to meet you once. How do I cover the journey
of so many years? That too in reverse. Mama, you know it is really difficult to walk in reverse. Once. Come in front of me just once. My heart wants that I open my eyes, and you suddenly come 
in front of me. Arooj. You are crying secretly?
