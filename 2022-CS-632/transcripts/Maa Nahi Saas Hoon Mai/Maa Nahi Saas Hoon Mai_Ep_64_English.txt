Who is this girl with aunt Mehreen, 
Wasai? As far as I feel, this is uncle Waqar, but this girl… who is this girl? Where is this girl now? What did I ask you that you are 
not answering me, Wasai? Tell me, I am asking you something. I have such bad luck. This picture travelled to 
so many places, and came to me and younger madam came 
and saw it. I have served this home 
for thirty years. What will happen now? Little madam will start questioning me as soon as it is morning. What will I tell her? Should I tell her the truth? That this girl was elder madam’s 
daughter, who had gotten lost. Or maybe she died. No, no, all this…no, I will not tell her anything more or else… or else, madam will kill me. I should run away from here, 
as soon as it is morning. Yes, I will run away. What is this Wasai? A relative of mine passed away. Please Wasai, don’t lie. You don’t have answers for 
my questions, that is why you are running away 
from me, right? Fine, you don’t want to tell me, right? 
Don’t tell me. I will get the answer for all these 
questions from aunty and aunt Mehreen. No, no, younger madam, don’t ask them. Then you tell me, what is the problem? What is the truth? I want to know. You have never spoken to me 
so strictly before today. Before today, you too have lived up 
to my friendship, Wasai. You have always supported me. And today you are running away 
from my questions, why? Younger madam, I am afraid. What are you afraid of Wasai? I want to know. What is the matter? Younger madam, it is better that some things 
remain a secret. If they are revealed then 
everything is ruined. I don’t understand 
what have I asked you? I had asked you a simple question, and you didn’t answer it. You showed me a picture of a girl, and I asked you who she is. Because no one talked about 
her in this home, they didn’t mention her, 
they didn’t even take her name. Whether it is aunt Mehreen, uncle, aunt or Salman. Who is that girl? Is she even alive or not? I want to know who this Areej is. Won’t you tell me, Wasai? Come in. Sir, we had found some files in 
the accounts, see them, please. Fine, I will go through them. You can go. Thank you. Thank you. This is some Areej’s will. Who can she be? Hey. Hey. Hey. The owner of the company is 
in my room today. Come, son. Come. Come on. I am the owner of the company but today I have found out that there are 
a lot of things that I am not aware of. What don’t you know, son? I was going through some 
old company files, so some property files 
also came across. What does this have? This states that we have a 
10-acre land on the highway, and a long time back, we were 
going to setup a textile mill there. Why don’t I know about this? Err… yes, yes, this was last Waqar’s dream, that 
we should also have a textile mill. Was that so? Fine, if it was papa’s dream, then
we will surely setup a mill there. But it states that the mill that was being 
made was in Areej’s name. Areej Textile. Who is this Areej? 
Why don’t I know about this? That… actually, child, your mama sister in law
 Mehreen liked this name, that’s it. there is nothing special. Are you sure. Yes. But don’t mention this in front of her. Because she starts missing late Waqar and she starts getting unwell. You understand, son? Okay. Fine. The thing is that Waqar and Mehreen 
only love Salman in name. They only call Salman 
their son in words. Idrees, my son is not a toy, nor a decoration piece, whom Mehreen and Waqar use 
to console themselves. That’s not true, they love Salman 
with their heart. Leave it. They couldn’t put a 100-yard plot 
in Salman’s name and they are giving so much 
to their daughter. Don’t you see this? What is wrong, Shaista? All the properties are owned by Waqar, he will put them in his daughter’s name. You are having hopes for no reason. When does this happen. Right now, you won’t understand 
what I am saying. But if Salman has hopes 
because of this love, then you will get the answer 
to every question of mine. I will tell you everything,
 younger madam but you will have to make 
a promise to me. What promise? That you will not tell anyone 
what I will tell you. Especially… in fact, to no one. Especially? Meaning? No one special. Everyone is special. Little sir knows nothing about this. And madam, and elder sir, will curse me badly for 
revealing this secret. Most importantly, elder madam will not be able to 
tolerate this shock of her past. Fine, Wasai. You trust me, I will not tell 
anyone anything. Tell me from the start, 
what is this story? Elder madam and elder sir didn’t have a child. After a lot of prayers and charity 
a daughter was born at their home, both of them named her Areej. So, when is that child now? I don’t know where that child went. God knows, if she is alive or if she died. What happened, then? Elder sir was really happy. He put all his property 
in Areej’s name. He even got a gold jewellery 
made for her, on which he got Areej’s name written. Then where did that child go? Elder sir, wanted to start a factory 
in Areej’s name. He left home to start the work 
of the factory, and he had an accident. Elder sir was no more. Elder madam got hurt in the head, and she lost her memory. Nothing happened to madam, she didn’t get hurt. and that girl Areej? What happened to her? Then that girl was never found. It was secluded place. People say that maybe some wild
 animal ate that child. Younger madam, I have told you everything. But you will have to remember 
your promise. Mom was telling me 
you went to the doctor. What did the doctor say? Everything is fine. Great. Can I tell you something interesting? Yes. This is something even I didn’t know 
in all these years, but I found out today. What is that? Dad had started a project 
by the name of Areej textile. I am surprised who was that Areej, whose name dad and 
mom liked so much that dad started a project
 in her name. So, did you not try to find out why he named it Areej. I asked uncle, but he didn’t give me
a clear answer. That had to happen. Here everything is incomplete. Everything is hidden from everyone. No one knows anything. What happened Arooj? 
What are you thinking? Nothing. Can I tell you another interesting thing? The place where Master Shoaib 
and aunt Naseema found you is really close to Areej textile. Meaning, long time back 
we have stayed really close. I will go get fresh. It is completely your fault. Who had told you to keep the land 
for the factory for so long. You surprise me, Shaista. It was late mama’s orders, that it is Waqar and his daughter’s 
memento, and I shouldn’t sell the land. So, I didn’t sell the land. And till the time Salman grew up, 
I took care of the factory. Waqar would have thought that 
putting everything in Areej’s name, we will become dependent on her. But still everything belongs to us. What are you saying, Shaista? Waqar was my younger brother 
and Areej my niece. Really? Your brother never treated you 
like a brother. He always kept you as her employee. I have no sorrow in that. Because late Waqar was the one who established that entire business, 
entire empire, not me. Anyway, Mehreen did just 
one good thing in her life that she considered our son 
Salman her own. Because of which, all this property, this business, became ours. Shaista, today I am seeing that 
same old hatred in your tone. This states that we have a 10-acre land
 on the highway, and a long time back, we were going to setup 
a textile mill there. Why don’t I know about this? Err… yes, yes, this was last Waqar’s dream, that we should also have a textile mill. Was that so? Fine, if it was papa’s dream, then we will surely setup a mill there. But it states that the mill that was 
being made was in Areej’s name. Areej Textile. Who is this Areej? 
Why don’t I know about this? Waqar, what are these documents for? I have put my property, 
this home, the entire business in Areej’s name. You have put everything 
in Areej’s name? Yes, child, Mehreen, even if you give your life 
for your daughter it is less. Daughters are such creations. Mehreen is considering 
Salman her son. She always considers him her son. Earlier she used to say 
Salman is her son, but now we will say that 
Salman is Mehreen’s son. Mama, what does this mean? This means, no one will make Mehreen realize 
that Salman is not her son. And yes, no one will mention Waqar and 
Areej in front of Mehreen. This is my decision. Yes, mama, as you say. Did you hear me too, Wasai? Yes, yes, mama, as you order. This is a matter of my Mehreen’s life. Shaista, I see the same old hatred 
in your tone today. Hatred in my tone? Because the sweetness of my tongue
has ended today. So, what should I do? I have sacrificed a lot. I emptied my arms and 
fill Mehreen’s arms. I handed over my Salman to her. So, will that not have a price? There surely will be. And I will take that price as well. I have shown patience 
on my motherhood. You saw my patience, now see my anger. Elder madam and elder sir didn’t have a child. After a lot of prayers and charity 
a daughter was born at their home, both of them named her Areej. I don’t know where that child went. God knows, if she is alive or if she died. What happened, then? Elder sir was really happy. He put all his property 
in Areej’s name. He even got a gold jewellery 
made for her, on which he got Areej’s name written. Then where did that child go? Elder sir, wanted to start a factory 
in Areej’s name. He left home to start the work 
of the factory, and he had an accident. This picture is with Wasai? And the bracelet this child is wearing
 in her hand, even papa and mama have 
an identical bracelet. The disappearance of this Areej took place on the day of 
uncle Waqar’s accident and the point of the accident 
is the same, the day is also the same. When mama and papa found me… No, no, no, so much coincidence? This is life, not a film. When does this happen? This is not possible. I have to bring this entire incident 
in order and try to find out something.
