What should I do? It wouldn’t look nice like this. Madam Sr, shall I get tea for you? No, I don’t need anything, I don’t need anything right now. You look a bit worried. Is everything okay? I am unable to find it. I have looked for it everywhere. I am afraid Salman’s 
mood might get off. what are you unable to find? Wasai, I cannot find a gift wrap. Gift wrap? Wasai, I cannot find a gift
 paper to pack. Okay, okay, if you want, I can get it 
packed from the market? Are you mad, Wasai? What if you lose it? Yes, you are right. Okay, don’t worry, let me do something. Right? We will pack it well for Salman, okay? If I go that soon, Madam Sr will have a doubt, I will go in a while. Where is Wasai? Just pray that we find it. What happened Wasai? Did you find the paper? Here, Madam Sr, I have found it with so 
much difficulty for you. Wasai, stay happy and stay blessed. Thank you so much. Okay do you need something else? No, I don’t need anything, just go. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Okay. You have done wonders today. Keep this. What is this for, madam Sr? It is your gift, you have done wonders today, you have made me happy. thank you... Let me pack it real quick. My Salman will be so happy 
today, just wait and watch. This is nice, let’s pack in this, by the way this is also good. Hmm. Wasai? What happened? Did you give the things to her? Why are you quiet? 
What happened? Tell me? Good job, Wasai, you scared me, thank you so much. Is it ever possible that my madam asked me 
to do some work and I won’t do it? Thank you. Happy Birthday to you. Thank you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday Dera Salman. Happy Birthday to you. Thank you so much, everyone. Thank you, mom, you know what? You are the best 
mother in the world. Thank you. Have it. Your turn, uncle. Thank you so much, everyone, really means a lot. Here, your gift. Mom, what is this? Open it and look at it yourself. How did you like it? Mom, this is… This is very cute, aunt. You have given such a 
nice present to Salman. Salman, do you know this gift is from your first Birthday. Thank you again, mom. Love you. Thank you so much. Thank you. What happened? You feel so much love 
for me today? You are my choice, I left the entire world and 
chose you for myself, I am proud of my choice. What have I done? You know it. Really? Do you know I have seen a competition in 
this house since childhood? What competition? Mom loves me a lot and Aunt gives me a lot of 
attention as compared to Mom because of which Mom
 is always irritated by Aunt. So? What is there to get 
so serious about? You are the only son 
of this house, that might be the only reason. Do you know something? What? You haven’t just won 
Mom’s heart today, but mine as well. You liked it? I liked it a lot. I am glad. Thank you so much. Thank you, mom, you know what? You are the best mother
 in the world. Love you. Thank you so much. My Salman was so happy, I was completely sure that he would love the gift I gave him and why wouldn’t he like it? I, his mother has given it to 
him with so much love, and that Urooj, what did she think by 
giving a cheap watch? She thought she
 could win from me? She was mistaken, my son, my Salman is just mine, just mine. Salman, Oh God! Mercy. What happened to my son? Are you okay? Salman is not your son, 
he is my son. Salman, did you get hurt?
 Are you okay? I am fine mom. Thank God. You don’t have to worry so much 
about Salman, sister-in-law, enough, for God’s sake. What did I say wrong? I have just called him my son. It is wrong for someone else to 
call Salman their son except me. for God’s sake please! Enough! Both of you are always 
arguing about me. Salman? mom, please! I am already so late, I have to go. Did you see? You spoiled his mood, he is my son, I know it very
 well how to treat him. Now he left the house angrily. What is it Urooj? Hello? Salman? Are you okay? Look what had to happen,
 it did, there is no use of taking 
it so much on your brain. How should I not take 
it hard on me? Is this a way? Okay, please relax, why are you getting angry? You are going to the office, 
you have so much work, okay you must drive and call me as soon as you 
reach to the office, okay? Don’t worry. Bye. Bye. Yes mom, what is it? Salman, my love, where are you? where would I be? I am going to the office, please do not disturb me. Why would I disturb you? I just called to say that there is no need to get angry and whatever sister-in-law 
Shaista has said, just forget about it. But you guys won’t let me forget it. And please for God’s sake, stop fighting for me. Sister-in-law Shaista 
must think that, I am your mother my child and everyone should 
know that anyway. Mom, everyone knows it, everyone knows 
you are my mother. Why are you guys so adamant 
on making my life hell? God forbid, anything 
happens to you, may you get my life as well. So then for God’s sake, please! Leave me alone! Salman? Salman? What is this sound? Hello? Salman, 
say something Sal… Hello? Salman, 
what happened? Why don’t you say something? Hello? Give it to me. Hello, my child, Salman? Why don’t you say anything? What happened? Salman? Where is my son? What happened? How is he? Nothing will happen to Salman, 
God will have mercy. Nothing will happen. My son, where is Salman? Nothing should happen
 to my son, brother, nothing should happen. nothing will happen to Salman, just pray for him. Shaista, just stay strong, God will have his mercy on him. Everything will be fine. Have courage, my child, you need to stay strong else it will get difficult 
to control them. Everything will be fine, 
Mehreen, don’t worry, everything will be fine. Come, come, come here, my child. Come. Come. Oh God, have mercy, keep my child in your protection, who gave evil to my son, oh God. Oh God. Doctor? Doctor, how is Salman now? Patient is out of danger now. There is no need to worry but you have to arrange blood, O+ Take my blood. Your blood group is O+? I am the mothe… I am Salman’s mother, my son will get my blood. Nurse. Hmm. Wasai, you? Greetings, Madam Jr. Greetings. When did you come? Just right now, I couldn’t resist. My heart was towards 
the hospital only. I was getting very strange
 thoughts in my mind, so I immediately came here. Salman is very lucky that Aunt Shaista, Aunt Mehreen, everyone loves him a lot. And you love him so much too. Sir Jr has played in my lap. But Wasai, I don’t understand one thing that why is there this race of love for Salman 
between Aunt Shaista and Aunt Mehreen? What is the reason? Actually, the thing is Sir Jr is the only child of this house, Madam Sr loves him, the other madam loves him a lot too. I guess because she doesn’t have 
any children of her own. yes, you got it absolutely right. Now look, I love Sir Jr so much too, I don’t even have any child, I cannot even say that Sir Jr is like my own child because I am a maid. Wasai? Why do you think like that? Everyone respects you 
so much in the house. Stay blessed Madam Jr. Come I will take 
you where everyone is. Yes. what was the need
 for you to say this? if you would have spilled 
the tea that you are his mother there 
would have been a problem. You are the limit, one problem doesn’t get solved and you prepare to 
create another one. Our hard work of all these 
years will go to waste. Okay, I will stay quiet, let her give the blood. You can fulfill your wish 
if her blood group doesn’t match. Let me tell you something, Idrees, it wouldn’t make any 
difference if we stay quiet, he is our blood and blood definitely speaks. You don’t have to worry, I have called the blood bank, they have arranged the blood. None of you will have
 to give the blood. I will be right back. Is Salman okay? yes, Salman is absolutely fine. You will see, if he gets my blood, he will get fine by tonight 
and come home. Mehreen, actually 
that is not needed, doctor has said since 
you are aged so you shouldn’t give the blood. He is my son, he will get my blood, 
I have just said it. Mehreen, Mehreen, it is not good for your health. God forbid, if something 
happens to you, what will happen to Salman? nothing will happen to me. Look, don’t be stubborn, it is like being selfish, I know you love Salman a lot but the blood has been arranged,
 the doctor has said. Okay? Sit down. Salman? Salman? My child. Is he okay? Oh god! Thank God, my son is fine. Easy, sister-in-law Shaista, can’t you see he is sleeping 
and he is been injured. You will see my son will get absolutely fine, I have prayed a lot for
 my son’s long life. How is it possible that God doesn’t answer
 a mother’s prayers? Mom? Mom. Urooj, is everything okay? Why are you crying, my child? Everything is fine, mom, I just felt like hugging and 
crying someone of my own. My child, have patience
 and courage, all this is a test from God, can I meet Salman? No, no, dad, not right now. Is there anything to 
worry about, Urooj? No, mom, thank God, he just had a minor
 injury on his head, doctor has said that there’s 
nothing to worry about, he will be well soon. If God wills. Don’t worry, God will make things well. Amen. Both of you come 
sit here meanwhile. I will make you meet 
Salman then. Okay, my child. Greetings. Greetings. How are you? yes, I am absolutely fine. Salman will be absolutely fine, don’t worry. Yes, I know Salman 
will be absolutely fine, after all he has his 
mother’s prayers with him. Indeed, a mother’s 
prayers are very powerful. Yes. A mother’s prayers 
act like a wall in front of the curse 
sent by someone. There is no curse, 
sister Mehreen, it was just a mere coincidence. Sister Naseema, I am so worried right now so I don’t want to get into all this. yes. I think we don’t have 
to stay here now, they will discharge 
Salman in the morning. So, who will stay 
with Salman tonight? Umm, Urooj must definitely 
stay and Mehreen. Why Mehreen? Why not me? What will you do here? So, what will Mehreen do? What nonsense? 
Is the time to compete? it is not about competition, he is my son, how can I just leave 
him here and leave? This is a hospital, it is not appropriate for 
a lot of people to stay here. So, then you must take 
Mehreen home. Why do you say 
the same thing again that you even have an answer to? Mehreen will not go from here. Then I won’t go as well. Okay, I am leaving, call me in case of any problem. Mom. yes, my child? How is my son? My love. Aunt Mehreen’s behavior is very rude with Aunt Shaista but Aunt Shaista still 
loves Salman so much, she doesn’t care about Aunt 
Mehreen’s rude behavior at all. Salman is very lucky that he gets so much love from both of them. She was trying to stay 
awake for no reason to prove her love for Salman. I am his mother, I couldn’t even sleep for a moment.
