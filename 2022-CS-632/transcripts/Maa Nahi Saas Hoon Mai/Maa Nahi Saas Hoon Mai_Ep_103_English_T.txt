[34.12] Arooj.
[35.92] You came suddenly.
[38.08] You didn’t even inform us 
before coming.
[41.36] If we knew something, 
we would have told you.
[45.72] Arooj,
[46.80] is everything fine?
[50.20] Papa, that…
[57.12] Sister, Mehreen, you tell us,
[59.52] what is the matter? 
Is all okay?
[63.96] Actually,
[66.36] we left that home and came.
[71.68] You left that home?
[76.96] What happened, Arooj?
[80.88] There was no space left for us
[84.00] to live in that hatred filled 
environment.
[89.32] Mama was really scared
[92.16] that my life and Areej’s life could be
 in danger living there.
[138.88] Master,
[143.04] find a solution.
[147.08] Arooj is constantly crying.
[151.72] She is not even able to sleep 
for a moment.
[164.04] This way, she will fall ill.
[170.28] I am thinking of how this problem can
be solved in a reasonable manner.
[178.68] You think that after the worst behaviour
 of Salman and his family
[187.36] we will be able to find a 
reasonable solution.
[193.28] Yes, I have faith this will happen.
[199.52] They dragged them out of the home.
[203.16] They snatched the daughter.
[210.68] Master,
[212.36] I think you should take 
the help of the law.
[219.00] Naseema, if I get disappointed, 
then we will go to the law.
[226.12] A lot of time will pass like this.
[229.72] It is a question of two lives.
[236.20] On one hand there is our Arooj
[240.08] and on the other Areej.
[245.12] You are right.
[249.12] After going to the court,
[258.12] the door for negotiation closes
[262.56] and also the way to return.
[266.40] If you are thinking
[269.08] that Salman will take Arooj,
[273.76] then you are wrong.
[276.48] No, this is possible.
[284.16] He dragged Arooj out of the home,
[288.28] and you are still mistaken.
[292.88] This is the limit.
[294.88] Naseema,
[297.60] it is really painful for decent girls to go 
to the police station and visiting courts.
[317.00] I will do something.
[320.20] You go and console Arooj.
[394.04] My heart is really restless.
[401.40] I don’t know what condition 
Areej would be in,
[403.28] would she have eaten or not.
[405.88] I am really worried.
[418.68] Don’t worry like this, child.
[421.44] Her grandmother will take care of her.
[424.64] Salman is so cruel.
[431.52] He didn’t even think how such a small
child will live without her mother.
[437.60] Areej should be with me 
right now, mama.
[451.72] You didn’t do the right thing.
[454.28] This is injustice.
[458.40] A daughter is with her father,
[461.44] what is unjust in this? 
What did I do wrong?
[463.64] What is wrong is that right now she 
should have been with her mother.
[467.68] So, she is with her mother.
[473.52] With my mother.
[475.64] She will die without her mother.
[479.84] She will die?
[482.00] I didn’t die without my mother,
[483.64] that Arooj didn’t die without 
her mother.
[486.48] Salman, if something happened
 accidentally,
[490.36] what enjoyment do you want to 
drive by applying it to yourself?
[495.76] I don’t want to enjoy anything.
[499.56] I want to humiliate Arooj, 
I want to give her pain.
[505.28] Sister in law Arooj has no fault.
[507.00] It is her fault.
[508.80] She came in my life, 
she ruined it.
[514.32] You are forgetting one thing 
in your anger and disgust.
[517.12] And this is the biggest flaw 
of anger.
[522.16] What? What am I forgetting?
[524.40] That sister in law Arooj 
was your love
[526.68] and you married out of love.
[528.12] I made a mistake that I loved her.
[536.84] I have forgotten everything.
[539.48] Salman, you are trying to see 
things as per your wish,
[544.08] and it will not have a good result.
[546.60] I came here to talk to you about 
what was in my heart,
[549.68] but you really like being a philosopher.
Fine, then, sit here.
[552.88] Salman, listen to me. 
I don’t want to hear anything.
[554.92] Salman.
[556.60] Salman.
[578.88] He is not doing as he says.
[590.36] While acting he has forgotten 
how to behave with Arooj.
[606.12] Your parents are really smart,
 Salman.
[608.56] They have taken advantage of 
this naivety of yours.
[620.88] You have gone to take revenge
for something
[623.80] in which the one in front of 
you is innocent.
[663.84] Wasai,
[665.60] why did aunt come here?
[674.60] I don’t know.
[807.04] You are at peace, right?
[809.80] I don’t like it at all.
[812.60] You will find the marks 
of the slaps
[815.64] you hit on my face 
on your existence.
[824.12] She is my daughter. 
I say, leave her.
[826.00] I will not let you bring her up.
[827.92] Leave her I say. 
Give her to me.
[829.24] Leave her. 
She is my daughter
[831.92] and I will not let you bring her up.
[834.68] Salman, son, don’t do that.
[837.60] We will sit and talk. 
Come.
[841.52] The time to sit and talk has passed.
[844.28] Leave her, I cannot live without her.
[846.16] Why can you not live without her?
[848.20] Did you not live without your mother?
[852.00] She is my daughter, 
she will live with me.
[853.80] You cannot do this. 
Salman, stop. Salman!
[897.44] What sort of fate is this,
[908.64] that wants to repeat itself 
again and again?
[919.40] I was deprived of my mother’s lap
[928.08] and Salman…
[935.56] Salman couldn’t get his 
mother’s lap.
[946.44] And now my daughter?
[958.44] My daughter was separated
 from my lap.
[972.44] No,
[974.12] the fate of my daughter and 
I cannot be similar.
[985.76] It cannot be.
[995.36] That’s it, not anymore.
[1003.80] Now no one can distance me 
from my daughter.
[1014.48] Salman, I will take back my daughter
 from you at all cost.
[1023.44] And if you don’t give her to me,
[1034.80] then this is a mother’s promise.
[1044.64] Even if I have to snatch 
my daughter from you,
[1057.64] then I will snatch her,
[1063.68] but I will surely...
[1074.60] bring back my Areej.
[1188.84] Hello.
[1191.64] You are back,
[1194.04] is Salman still in office?
[1196.96] Salman seldomly comes 
to the office.
[1200.48] Really?
[1202.64] Then he must go out 
for meetings?
[1206.56] It is not that. He goes out, 
he has outings.
[1211.20] That is really good.
[1218.24] Let him enjoy.
[1220.32] This burden has been removed 
from his head after so long.
[1233.36] This is the time he has to enjoy.
[1239.28] After all, why does he need to work? 
He has employees to work for him.
[1252.52] Where is Areej?
[1253.76] Lower your voice, 
she will wake up,
[1261.76] and she will put my life 
in difficulty.
[1269.12] She cries all the time, 
just like her mother.
[1272.32] I cannot take care of her.
[1275.12] So why have you stopped Chandu?
[1277.24] She is here for my work,
[1283.52] not to take care of her.
[1286.44] And whose responsibility is Areej?
[1288.28] Her mother's.
[1291.92] Meaning, if the mother is the enemy,
then the daughter is also your enemy.
[1294.08] You are really tough.
[1296.36] What do you think?
[1298.88] I kept her in my love?
[1302.32] Not at all.
[1309.88] I have only kept her here,
[1312.20] so that I can torture Arooj 
and Mehreen.
[1323.80] Okay, you leave all this.
[1328.80] You come and sit, I have to talk to you
 about something important.
[1331.16] Come on.
[1349.88] Don’t you think,
[1352.68] Salman has changed a little.
[1361.44] He has become really bitter.
[1363.28] He has even started 
misbehaving with us.
[1369.12] He didn’t do this earlier.
[1372.88] What do you want to say, Shaista?
[1374.84] I feel Mehreen and Arooj have got 
magic done on Salman.
[1382.28] This is the limit Shaista, 
there is nothing like that.
[1386.20] You can note this done,
[1388.28] I am sure there is 
something like that.
[1390.64] Shaista, I already have 
to think a lot,
[1392.76] now you are putting me 
on another path.
[1396.12] You surprise me.
[1408.88] My doubt is absolutely correct,
[1412.68] these people have surely done 
something
[1415.28] or else how can my son change
 like this?
[1421.04] I don’t want to argue with you.
[1423.28] I am just saying that you will have 
to take care of Areej.
[1426.20] Salman, son, try and understand.
[1429.72] I cannot take care of such a small
child in this age.
[1433.44] I get tired.
[1436.72] You are right.
[1440.40] How can you take care of her?
[1442.84] You don’t have experience.
[1448.72] What do you mean?
[1450.40] You gave someone else your child 
to take care of,
[1452.92] then where will you get experience
from? Huh?
[1456.40] You are misbehaving with me.
[1458.28] I am not misbehaving with you.
[1461.68] I am just telling you that you will 
have to take care of Areej.
[1467.88] I have to go to the office,
[1469.40] I have to take care of the 
responsibilities there.
[1470.84] If I didn’t have to go, I would have 
taken care of her.
[1473.84] You can at least take up 
this responsibility,
[1476.08] she is your granddaughter.
[1501.96] Child, both your mothers think
[1504.52] that we should get Areej 
through police.
[1508.60] What do you think?
[1512.64] You were saying that you are 
thinking of something.
[1518.00] Yes, child, I am thinking,
[1520.84] but Naseema and sister Mehreen 
says we should file a case.
[1529.68] I just want my Areej back.
[1552.28] Can I ask you something, child?
[1556.24] Go ahead.
[1557.80] Whatever Salman did with you 
and your mother,
[1562.80] after that, do you want to live 
with Salman?
[1606.72] Child, I don’t understand 
the meaning of your silence.
[1618.08] I don’t know if it is a yes or a no.
[1624.60] I want to make my last attempt.
[1638.20] Maybe I can change Salman’s heart.
[1644.40] Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t go through the police station.
[1665.32] I will try my best to save my home.
[1671.80] Even after so much happened?
[1702.12] Only for the sake of my daughter.
[1707.52] I think the same.
[1715.88] You have reduced the burden 
on my heart by saying this.
[1750.28] Pray to God,
[1753.44] He will make a way.
[1773.24] What sort of sorrow 
do we have, mama?
[1776.64] That your husband’s home is the 
same as my husband’s home.
[1780.96] That is not Salman’s home.
[1784.56] Right now, he is living there.
[1788.24] Very soon, everything will be fine.
[1792.08] Impossible.
[1794.24] When I can find you 
in twenty five years,
[1798.60] if this possible,
[1801.44] then anything is possible.
[1803.96] I can understand your sorrow.
[1808.20] I have stayed in that home 
for some time,
[1812.08] but you have spent a lot 
of time there,
[1815.12] you got married and came 
to that home,
[1817.44] You have seen a lot in that home.
[1820.92] I never wanted that 
you leave that home.
[1824.64] But, I gave up in front of 
your insistence.
[1831.04] I got scared.
[1834.16] I was fearful.
[1837.88] I had to do all this because of
you and Areej.
[1850.76] I am really sorry, man.
[1853.92] I don’t know what happens to me,
[1856.80] and then everything gets ruined.
[1864.04] This is my fault.
[1866.80] I admit it.
[1870.00] Right now,
[1874.36] I want to live here with my parents.
[1879.48] But why?
[1884.00] I have to search for my parents.
[1889.36] Going to that home, 
I get lost in myself,
[1893.12] then how will I be able 
to find anyone else?
[1896.24] So, I will help you find them.
[1898.92] I am with you.
[1927.92] Where are you coming from, son?
[1931.92] When a person comes home,
[1934.32] you ask how they are.
[1940.12] You don’t start questioning them.
[1944.72] You have come really late,
[1946.52] that’s only why I am asking.
[1948.32] I am not a school going child,
[1950.60] that I go on time and 
come back on time.
[1959.80] I am a businessman,
[1968.08] people know me as Salman.
[1972.36] No one knows me as your son.
