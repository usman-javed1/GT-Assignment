The Areej that you wanted 
to know about is Arooj, Mehreen’s missing daughter. To hide this from Mehreen, we hid it from everyone. What? What are you saying? How is this possible? The one who I always thought 
to be my mother is not my mother but Arooj’s? Now you understand how you were 
made the heir of the entire property and business after 
Arooj went missing? I will go mad. No. You don’t have to get mad, 
you need to act very sanely. Arooj is a very clever girl, she is also the heir to the entire 
business and property. But she is my wife. She is Mehreen’s daughter, now that the reality is 
in front of you, don’t expect anything good 
from Mehreen as well, and Arooj will stand with her mother 
in this situation. I don’t know what is 
all this going on. Salman, what are you looking for? I am looking for myself. I am lost. You are not lost, you have been found. You shut up! I don’t want to listen to anything, 
go away. Aunt Mehreen is very unwell, she is in the room. Mom, I feel like I am dreaming. Your dream has now come true,
 my child. Yes, you are absolutely right. Do you know, after meeting mom, I have waited for so long to hug her? Why does your tone sound so sad 
all of a sudden, Arooj, my child. You figured it out by my tone 
that I am sad? What if I didn’t birth you? I am still your mother. Anyway, leave it, you tell me the reason behind
 your sadness. I am just sad about one thing, mom, that why my mom didn’t see
 my childhood. Who are you talking to Arooj? Umm, umm I, I was talking to Mom, 
I’ll phone… No, no, let it be, don’t do this at all,
 don’t do it. In fact, give it to me, 
I will talk to her. You will talk to her? Yes. Okay. Hello? 
Yes, my child? Mom wants to talk to you. Umm, look, talk to Mom, our Arooj is so fortunate, she has two mothers. Yes, our Arooj is very fortunate, she has two mothers, the one who birthed and the one who raised her. Sister Naseema, I don’t understand how to 
apologize to you, thank you so very much you raised my Arooj so well. I will forever be grateful to you. What favor? I just fulfilled a mother’s duty. Thank you so much, bye. 
Bye. What is this? You started crying yourself while 
trying to console your mother. I am crying about my fate, I found my mother after so long, 
after so many efforts, after so many difficulties, and when I found my mom, I am sad that she is not 
ready to hug me. Greetings. 
Greetings. Tell Mr Salman, 
Advocate Basit Alvi is here. Okay, sir. Did you note all the points? Yes sir. Perfect, then do share it with me
whatever feedback you get. Yes, sir. Thank you. Sir, Advocate Basit Alvi is here. Okay, get him seated, 
I will call him. Okay sir. Sir, have a seat. okay. Thank you. 
You’re welcome. Okay then you work on this
and do let me know. Right sir. And yes, the lawyer is here, 
send him to me. Right sir. Thank you. 
Thank you. Greetings sir. Greetings. Come, sir is calling you. Okay, thank you. Greetings, Mr Salman,
 how are you? Greetings, absolutely fine, 
how are you? Good, by the grace of God. 
Have a seat. thank you. Tell me, what will you have?
 Coffee or tea? Order whatever you like. Miss Tooba, send two cups of coffee. Right Sir. 
Thank you. So tell me, what is the progress? Mr Salman, the thing is you are 
the owner of this company right now but you staying in this position is 
in the control of Madam Arooj. What do you mean? My Dad has put in the attorney of 
this entire business under my name. No, no, look even your Dad is not 
the actual owner of it. How is that possible? He is the eldest in this house. Okay, so you just told me that Mr Waqar’s missing daughter 
has been found again? Yes, that’s how it is. okay, tell me all this business, property, bank balance was 
under whose name? His daughter’s. So then if she is present or 
if she comes back, she will be the actual owner. I mean, she is the lawful heir to it. And what if she doesn’t claim it? In that situation, you will have 
to get another attorney, and that too is up to Madam Arooj 
if she gives you the attorney or not. How is it possible? Mr Salman, this is the law,
 it’s not my fault. Your hollow talks, I will not believe them. But you will at least accept that I did all this for your better. I don’t want to hear this. My ears are fed up of listening to 
all these nonsensical things. These are not nonsensical things, 
this is the reality, son. So then what is the outcome 
of that reality? Is there any outcome? Zero. There is an outcome, now Salman is the sole owner 
of this entire property, this house, and this business, 
this is the result. Just for the sake of your good days, I controlled myself, had been patient, what else can a mother do? Now you understand how you were 
made the heir of the entire property and business after Arooj 
went missing? I will go mad. No. You don’t have to get mad, 
you need to act very sanely. Arooj is a very clever girl, she is also the heir to the entire
business and property. But she is my wife. She is Mehreen’s daughter, now that the reality is 
in front of you, don’t expect anything good 
from Mehreen as well, and Arooj will stand with her mother 
in this situation. It means it will be famous in 
the entire city now that Salman’s business belongs 
to his wife Arooj, nothing belongs to Salman. No, I won’t let that happen at all. Musarrat, Musarrat, I told you I will solve 
all the problems, yes, okay I will talk to you later. Boss, why is Madam Arooj here? Arooj is here? 
Where is she? She is talking to the staff
at the reception. okay. Hello? 
Salman, Arooj has come to the office. Arooj is here? See how she started to spread 
her wings as soon as she came. Okay, ask Nawaz to send her 
to my room. Why has Arooj come all of a sudden? Salman, your anger towards myself 
and Shaista is legit but there is a huge reality that 
you aren’t aware of. Oh okay, so there is another reality that still hasn’t been revealed to me? You know according to the documents 
there is an Areej textile mill. Yes, I know. And you even asked me who is this Areej that the textile mill 
is named after. I did ask. Did you get the answer? None of you gave me an answer. And do you also know that Arooj’s parents are not her 
actual parents? yes, I know that. I was the one who helped Arooj 
in finding her parents. There is no need for that. Areej that you wanted to know
about is Arooj, Mehreen's missing daughter. Oh so I should come here daily, 
that is what you all want? Madam, Mr Salman is calling you 
to his office. Okay. Mom, I have felt peace on your face 
ever since Areej has come. yes, that’s exactly how it is. Do you know Salman, I feel that I have a very deep and 
old bond with Areej, but what is it? Are you feeling peaceful? yes, very peaceful. Do you know Mom, when I come to you, I forget all my problems. After all my son is my life. My son is my life. Did you see, Mehreen, how I played the whole game 
and won too? What did you win? How I took my son back from you that too with full profit. My son Salman is the sole owner of this entire 
property and business. So you are accepting this yourself, that you have done 
this disgusting act. You will get an answer to this when Salman will stay with me and you will be left all alone. I could have never thought that someone could plan 
so mercilessly. Please, keep your dialogues to yourself. By the way, to be honest, I feel pity on you, Mehreen, you have become so helpless. Whatever you have done, you were my mother-in-law 
at that time, but now, you are my mother. Shall I tell you something? Yes, tell me. The day I found out 
you are my mother, I just used to feel love 
looking at you no matter how angry 
you would be with me. So why didn’t you immediately tell me? You should have told me right then, 
why didn’t you tell me? I would have definitely told you, Mom, but because of your mental health, I had a fear in my heart, God forbid something happens to you. Why have you come here? To meet you. Why do you want to meet me?
