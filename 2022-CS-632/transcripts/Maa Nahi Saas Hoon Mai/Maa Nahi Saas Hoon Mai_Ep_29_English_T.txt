[36.40] On 26th June
[39.80] a payment of three million was 
made to Sasa builders.
[50.40] There is no receiving in the file.
[70.68] There is no update on the system either,
[75.00] neither are any details being 
shown in the accounts.
[88.28] And this is from when Salman 
went to the UK.
[95.20] So, this means
[97.64] he was only made to sign the cheque.
[106.00] If the payment has not reached 
the builder, then,
[113.48] where did the three million rupees go?
[157.24] Oh,
[162.48] this is the reality.
[170.88] Uncle?
[195.52] Hey, come child. Come, Arooj.
[201.04] Come. Come. Have a seat.
[208.80] How is everything going?
[210.32] Really good.
[212.76] Very good.
[213.80] I thought you would get bored 
of this accounting.
[216.80] No, not at all.
[218.56] In fact, the more I get into this work, 
my interest level is increasing.
[224.20] Okay.
[226.88] Uncle, I wanted to ask you something 
about Nawaz.
[232.52] About Nawaz?
[234.04] Yes. 
What?
[237.84] Nawaz works here as an account manager, 
right?
[246.76] So, what sort of a man is he?
[252.20] He is trustworthy.
[267.20] Trustworthy for the company or
[270.44] trustworthy to you?
[276.60] He has been working here 
for a lot of years.
[280.20] The company has no complaints 
towards him.
[284.00] By the way, why are you asking this?
[287.20] Just like that.
[289.56] I was looking deeply in some matters
 of the finance,
[293.40] so I thought I would ask you about it.
[296.20] Okay. Okay.
[298.04] If you feel that Nawaz is not right,
[302.04] we will fire him.
[303.48] No, there is nothing like that. 
I didn’t say that to you.
[307.92] I was just asking.
[312.44] Okay.
[320.20] Will you have coffee?
Huh?
[323.20] Sure.
[331.20] Send two good cups of coffee.
[397.84] Yes, wife of mine, what is it? 
I am in the office.
[401.08] Saira, what is wrong?
[402.44] You know there are six days left 
till I get the salary.
[411.72] Hey, I don’t have money,
[414.36] don’t bother me.
[418.92] I know, I have to pay the fees 
of the children,
[421.52] but where do I get the money from?
[430.56] Cut the call.
[476.80] Such a big fraud has occurred 
in the office,
[483.72] but…
[491.04] looking at Nawaz’s condition, 
I don’t think even he got anything.
[510.20] I feel
[515.48] uncle took everything in his control.
[530.48] The entire expenses of the home, 
to the extent
[537.48] that the company takes care 
of uncle’s car petrol.
[548.64] Then what does uncle do 
with this money?
[556.96] Now I will have to see.
[561.04] When there is corruption 
in one project,
[564.68] then it must be at other places too.
[585.28] Boss, I am really worried.
[588.36] What happened?
[590.80] The fees for both my children has 
not been paid.
[593.56] Boss, I need money.
[597.96] I don’t have money, there is still time 
till we get the salary.
[602.48] Boss, people like us live on the salary.
[605.80] People like you make this money 
from somewhere.
[609.20] Mind what you say, Nawaz.
[611.48] Do you understand?
[619.08] Hello.
[622.72] Yes, madam.
[628.04] I am coming.
[630.48] Madam Arooj is calling me 
to her room.
[634.88] Fine, go.
[664.60] Greetings mama.
[666.56] I am fine, how are you?
[669.52] Nothing, I was in office. 
I was doing some work.
[672.32] You tell me.
[678.68] Yes, yes, everything is fine.
[681.52] Okay, I will call you. Goodbye.
[688.96] Yes, madam.
[690.44] Mr. Nawaz,
[692.48] I wanted to ask you that
[695.40] the salary office pays you,
[698.52] are you able to manage in it?
[703.08] Yes, madam, I am just able to manage.
[707.88] How many children do you have?
[709.44] Two. One son, one daughter.
[712.88] Do they go to school?
[714.44] Yes, madam.
[716.88] How much fee do you pay
for both of them?
[721.28] Eighteen thousand.
[723.92] The expense for the van is separate.
[729.20] Okay.
[736.56] Hello.
[738.64] Sajid Hafeez,
[740.84] Make a cheque of twenty five thousand 
in Mr. Nawaz’s name
[746.20] and get it signed from me right now. 
Thank you.
[754.04] Mr. Nawaz,
[755.72] from today, the office will pay the expense 
of your children’s education.
[764.56] You can leave.
[771.60] Madam. 
Yes?
[774.04] Thank you.
[775.76] Thank you so much.
[777.80] You are welcome.
[806.48] I met her at the brunch of Edhi center.
[810.04] Madam. Madam.
[813.76] Maham, I will call you. 
What happened?
[817.00] Elder madam is doing weird things 
in her room.
[820.88] She looks at one corner of the room 
and scold someone at times,
[824.68] then she gets angry,
[826.96] then she goes to the other side 
and scolds someone.
[829.84] Although no one is in the room.
[832.04] God be kind.
[833.64] I think she had a mental breakdown again.
[836.20] You come with me.
[838.36] I want the account details on 
my table in an hour.
[842.64] I will not hear any excuse. 
Do you understand?
[846.68] Okay. Goodbye.
[854.32] And you people,
[856.48] have you come here as freeloaders?
[859.84] Is this how you work?
[865.28] It won’t work like this.
[867.04] Now I have come here, 
I will deal with all of you.
[874.28] Shut up.
[875.72] You will argue with me?
[877.96] Leave from here. 
Leave immediately.
[883.04] Disloyal people.
[885.60] Salman has hired the biggest lazy people
in his office.
[890.84] They just come to get their salaries.
[923.00] This is how you run an office.
[927.80] No one knows it better than me,
[932.76] and nor can anyone know it.
[956.16] Wasai.
[958.68] Wasai. 
Yes, coming.
[965.04] Yes, elder madam.
[966.84] Tell the driver to take out the car.
[968.84] Sure.
[971.12] Mehreen, where are you going?
[975.96] I am going to the office sister-in-law.
[981.32] What office? Salman’s office?
[984.12] Yes, sister-in-law.
[985.64] But why?
[988.16] When Arooj can go, 
then why can I not go?
[992.96] But Mehreen what will you do 
going to the office?
[996.20] I can do anything,
[998.20] but from today I will go the office daily.
[1002.08] Mehreen,
[1003.96] if you agree to me, then it is not right 
for you to go to Salman’s office.
[1012.68] All his office people will be there.
[1015.40] When the business community finds out 
that Salman’s mother has come to the office,
[1020.44] so what will they think?
[1022.84] Sister-in-law, what is wrong in this?
[1026.72] Look, Mehreen,
[1029.40] if you argue with Arooj, and you will have it,
[1034.48] then the entire noise and commotion will be
heard by the office people.
[1038.36] Everyone will find out, 
everyone will see.
[1045.04] Salman will get insulted badly.
[1048.28] Elder madam,
[1049.72] the driver has taken out the car.
[1055.16] Say no to him.
[1057.52] I am not going anywhere.
[1063.96] Yes, as you order.
[1149.12] Nawaz, come to my room.
[1159.64] Yes, madam.
[1162.00] Mr. Nawaz, this is Sasa Builder’s file, 
take it.
[1167.04] Madam, did you mark the objections?
[1170.40] Nope.
[1172.12] I have no objection.
[1176.52] Thank you madam. 
Welcome.
[1186.20] Look, you are on the top most position 
of your department.
[1190.52] This is a big responsibility.
[1194.44] Where money is involved
[1197.08] people don’t take long to 
become dishonest.
[1203.16] Obviously, you will have a lot of people 
under you.
[1208.28] Don’t ever trust anyone blindly.
[1215.92] Check and balance in really necessary
in monetary transactions.
[1226.48] So what did your madam Arooj say?
[1229.56] Boss, I was really scared.
[1231.36] I couldn’t sleep at night.
[1233.88] What did you think?
[1235.48] That you will get caught.
[1237.44] Not me, us.
[1239.24] You too are involved in this.
[1241.48] Boss, when do you give me a lot,
[1243.56] why are you taking my name?
[1247.80] Don’t talk nonsense.
[1251.16] Boss, I feel madam doesn’t know 
how to work,
[1253.80] or there were no chances of surviving.
[1258.88] This will not happen every time,
[1261.20] she is really smart.
[1263.48] meaning, if we get saved in 
the Sasa builder case,
[1266.40] we will get caught in some other case.
[1268.36] Say good things, 
whenever you open your mouth.
[1271.04] Boss, I am having bad days, 
how will I say good things.
[1275.28] After all, you give me more fear 
than the share I get.
[1280.32] Okay fine. Fine. 
We will see in future.
[1283.16] Really?
[1285.60] A little more.
[1288.12] Fine, boss, I will see.
[1313.00] If you are a little lenient, then,
[1319.52] the criminal starts suffering from 
unnecessary self-confidence
[1328.28] and he considers the one in front of them 
unaware and stupid,
[1341.04] and then,
[1344.60] they make a mistake.
[1349.44] I too will remain unaware like this.
[1353.36] Uncle should get a chance that
[1357.96] he makes another mistake.
[1374.56] I feel you have a lot of burden of work.
[1378.16] Yes, there is burden of work
[1381.76] but when your interest increases 
in work, you have fun.
[1387.52] This means you are enjoying 
your work.
[1390.28] Yes,
[1391.68] because you are with me all the time 
and I am with you.
[1395.48] Yes, that’s true.
[1397.16] But if you ever get bored, 
then tell me.
[1403.04] Of what.
[1404.20] Of work, what else?
[1408.24] Fine, I will tell you.
[1410.92] and as far as getting bored of me 
is concerned,
[1414.12] that will never happen.
[1416.24] Drive the car.
[1446.48] Hmmm.
[1450.12] Arooj,
[1455.20] when will this drama of yours end?
[1470.44] What do you mean?
[1476.48] What drama, aunty?
[1479.24] This…
[1481.00] the role of an office going girl that 
you have selected for yourself.
[1492.20] Now this drama won’t work.
[1502.36] Mehreen, don’t do this.
[1504.00] The child is interested for a few days, 
let her fulfill it.
[1508.36] This is not an interest brother Idrees,
[1511.84] it is something more than that.
[1514.88] I understand it all, 
I am not a child.
[1519.68] Arooj,
[1522.48] please sit down.
[1532.68] Arooj, you don’t leave food like this.
[1536.32] Come on, sit down and eat your food.
[1543.76] I am done eating, aunt.
[1558.16] My stomach is full.
[1571.48] Arooj.
[1575.24] Mehreen, don’t do this.
[1577.12] I will make her understand.
I will talk to her.
[1580.52] It is good brother Idrees,
[1583.12] do make her understand.
[1605.76] Everyone have food.
[1615.56] But this will ruin the environment of the home,
it will cause ill feeling.
[1619.64] But me going to the office,
[1622.04] working for the business will lead 
to ill feelings, why?
[1626.28] Yes, I understand that, 
Mehreen doesn’t.
[1629.20] Yes, but this is the matter of the office
[1632.00] and Salman has all the rights to the office.
[1635.24] Aunt Mehreen has no involvement in it.
[1638.28] You are absolutely right. Mehreen has 
no right on the business,
[1641.28] but she has a right on you because 
you are a part of the home.
[1646.76] That is why she has made you going 
to the office an issue,
[1649.32] and even Salman will get tension 
from this behaviour of Mehreen,
[1652.40] then he will argue with you.
[1655.68] That is not something right.
[1657.12] That is why you save your relation 
with Salman,
[1659.88] stop worrying about the business.
[1662.76] Meaning,
[1664.00] the betterment of the office has 
no importance.
[1666.84] Hey, you can hire anyone for that,
[1669.60] but no one can take your place at home. 
Understand?
[1715.52] Look, I gave you permission to go,
[1719.12] and now I am stopping you too.
[1724.08] You gave me permission to 
go to the office,
[1727.80] the reason was good,
[1732.48] but
[1736.00] I didn’t understand the reason 
for you saying no.
[1740.44] Mom’s refusal is a big reason
[1743.92] and you know how important 
she is for me.
[1748.32] And me?
[1759.52] Am I not important?
[1761.60] Arooj, why are you saying these things?
[1765.80] You too are really important for me.
[1770.20] Why are you making going to the office
 your ego issue?
[1774.32] If mom doesn’t understand, 
then you understand.
[1778.28] If she doesn’t want that you go 
to the office, then don’t go.
[1784.76] Meaning,
[1788.08] I have no will, I have no thinking.
[1791.12] Arooj, you are taking it wrong.
[1793.88] There is nothing like that.
[1796.32] I just want that the tension at home ends.
[1804.00] Trust me, Salman.
[1806.56] I giving you surety,
[1808.56] you will feel proud of me one day.
[1811.24] You will say yourself,
[1813.08] it was a good decision of mine to 
let you work in my company.
[1818.64] Trust me Salman. 
I trust you.
[1823.44] I trust you a lot.
[1826.76] But my mother’s order has more value 
for me than that.
[1865.84] Yes, madam?
Have a seat.
[1875.16] Mr. Nawaz, how many files do we have 
for the Stone Burry project?
[1879.32] Madam, we have just got into 
one contract for marble,
[1882.32] the file for which is in front of you.
[1884.88] Fine,
[1886.28] then as per this contract with Stone Burry,
[1888.96] we have given them
[1890.76] ten thousand square feet marble, right?
[1894.28] Yes, madam, that’s how it is.
[1897.36] And the project file, I checked,
[1900.08] in this project,
[1901.24] Stone Burry has taken nine thousand 
square feet marble.
[1909.36] What madam?
[1910.32] Yes, that’s how it is.
[1914.64] You tell me, where did one thousand 
square feet marble go?
[1920.68] Maybe, Mr. Idrees returned it.
[1924.96] Maybe?
[1930.96] You used a really good word ‘maybe’.
[1934.20] So, you too are not sure.
[1939.56] You know, Mr. Nawaz,
[1942.04] the cost of this marble is 
sixty five hundred thousand rupees.
[1948.76] Yes, madam, your calculation 
is absolutely right.
[1952.36] So you give me a report 
as soon as possible
[1954.84] where the remaining one thousand 
square feet marble go?
[1959.12] Yes, madam, I will ask Mr. Idrees 
and let you know.
[1978.56] There are a lot of problems, 
do you have any idea?
[1982.76] What happened, Nawaz?
[1984.96] Madam is inquiring about the one thousand
square feet marble.
[1991.24] What did you say?
[1992.96] What could I say, boss? 
I stayed quiet.
[1998.80] She was constantly asking 
such questions,
[2001.76] that I felt all our secrets will be 
out in the open.
[2010.60] Fine, I will think of something. 
You go.
[2013.36] Sure, boss.
[2027.36] Arooj is asking for the accounting 
of every single thing.
[2033.52] I will have to do something about 
her interference in the office.
[2051.12] Arooj.
[2053.20] Where do you feel there is a shortage
in Stone Burry? Tell me.
[2058.80] We made a deal of ten thousand 
square feet,
[2062.28] and the material delivered in the warehouse
is nine thousand,
[2065.92] so where is the remaining one thousand.
[2067.64] Hey, you don’t know 
there is wastage in this work,
[2069.84] it must have gone in that.
[2071.20] Uncle, if there is one percent wastage,
[2073.84] still where is the nine hundred square feet.
[2078.92] This cannot happen with me here.
[2082.72] Uncle, you try and understand.
Look at this.
[2087.04] We received the stair steps
[2090.12] and tower tiles prepared,
then why the wastage?
[2099.24] Come on, give me the file.
I will check it myself.
[2102.16] No, I think you check the records 
of the warehouse,
[2105.40] the file will stay with me.
[2108.12] Okay.
[2142.40] Yes, brother Idrees,
[2144.04] now you talk freely,
[2146.72] why are you so sad?
[2154.60] Mehreen, I admit that the business is 
not mine, it belonged to late Waqar.
[2158.04] I own nothing.
[2159.12] But I have a little respect, right?
[2163.04] What happened brother Idrees?
[2164.56] You are the elder of this home, 
all of us respect you a lot.
[2168.04] Everyone doesn’t respect me, 
that’s what I am crying about.
[2171.44] Brother Idrees, you tell me,
[2174.00] what has you worried so much?
[2176.76] Look Mehreen, Salman is my own,
[2179.52] but that new girl, 
your daughter-in-law, Arooj,
[2183.32] now will she question me too? Me?
[2186.56] Arooj?
[2188.24] Did Arooj say something to you? 
I will just question her.
[2191.56] No, no, you leave it. 
I don’t want anything like that.
[2194.24] It would be better that I leave Salman 
and do a job somewhere else.
[2198.44] No brother Idrees,
[2199.96] you cannot leave Salman at all.
[2203.88] I have left the business matters of Salman, 
with you there.
[2208.56] But, my heart is not satisfied, 
I am made to feel humiliation,
[2212.24] like I am a burden.
[2214.24] I have decided to quit this office.
[2217.36] No brother Idrees,
[2218.80] you will not leave the office at all.
[2220.76] If someone will leave the office, 
then that is Arooj.
[2230.00] You please, have tea.
[2233.40] Sure.
