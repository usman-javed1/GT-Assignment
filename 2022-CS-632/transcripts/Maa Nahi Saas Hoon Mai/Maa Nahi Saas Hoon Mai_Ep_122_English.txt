you are the wound I want to give to
 Mehreen and Arooj. Areej? Where is Areej? Everyone is my enemy, you guys took 
everything from me, that is why, now you will have to die. Mom, Areej is not in the room. What? Areej? Where would she be? Areej? Wasai? I will throw you and kill you. Areej! Stop, what are you doing? don’t you dare! Stay away, away, away… Shaista? Stay away! Leave her. Stay away, I will throw her down, I will kill her. she is innocent, what has she done to you? Please give her to me. You are right, she is not at fault, it is her mother’s fault, your mother’s fault. All of you have destroyed me, destroyed me, that is why, I am going to kill her. No Shaista! No. I will kill her. No, enough! Don’t take away
 my daughter’s happiness from her, for God’s sake, don’t. Happiness? What happiness are
 you talking about? You are talking about 
the happiness of this cursed girl? I even threw her in 
the trash 20 years ago. Yes, I threw her in the trash. so you were that cruel, sinner, criminal? Who took away a little baby from her... ... mother right after her birth and gave her punishment
 of so many years? Yes, birth reminds me of, Mehreen, do you remember when she was born, you took her in your 
arms instead of Salman, I decided at that time that I would definitely kill her, I wouldn’t leave her alive, that is why I threw her in the trash, but she, she didn’t even die in the trash and she wasn’t even eaten by an animal but instead, this enemy came back in my home. That is why, I will kill her now so you both can understand. No, no, please no. My daughter. Don’t you dare. Shaista? Enough, for God’s sake enough. you did what you had to but you see destiny planned something else, it planned something else. No, no, I haven’t done anything yet, I haven’t enjoyed yet, I will enjoy when Areej… No, no, no… Will be in the floor there. Don’t come forward. Both of you shouldn’t worry, she won’t cry, she will fall straight down and die immediately. Don’t do this. Don’t you dare. Wait, wait, she will leave her, yes, she will leave her, actually the thing is like 
a ghost’s soul is in a parrot, similarly Arooj your soul and Mehreen your soul is in Areej. Stop Shaista. Yes, according to the rules 
I should be doing that, I should tell Shaista, that Shaista, don’t kill Arooj’s daughter, don’t do it, it’s a bad thing, right? But if I should do this, 
why should I do this? I should get at least something too, at least something, 
I am very tired too. Come, daughter Arooj, good girl, my child, sign this file, come, come, sign it. The property will be ours and Areej will be yours, okay? Yeah? Okay? yes, I will do anything to 
save my daughter. I don’t want this property, I will sign it. Yes, that is what I am saying. Okay I will tell you the places. Look, come here. Sign it, sign it, we don’t need anything. A mother shouldn’t think for
 this long to save her daughter’s life, sign it, see its just
 two little signatures, good girl, do it, do it. Leave me, leave me, move back. Move back. I won’t leave you. Come here, 
I won’t leave you. Enough! Enough is enough! You first took away 
my daughter from me and now you 
were trying to take away... ... my daughter’s 
daughter from her, what kind of 
cruel people are you? You guys don’t deserve to be amongst
 the list of human beings, people like you 
who are slaves of money, for whom money is more 
important than people, I feel disgusted living under
 the same roof with them, I feel disgusted. Get out of here! Let’s go. Get out! Shaista, let’s go from here, let’s go, let’s go. Oh God! Arooj. Arooj. My father put all 
the property and ... ...business in my name
 when he was dying. And I will bury this
 truth in the ground. You know this reality but you don’t accept it, don’t worry, I will make you accept
 it very soon too. How can he forgive 
me for conspiracy and honor? I forgive them. Have courage, 
Shaista, have courage. How should I have courage? How? Every plan has failed everytime. Where did I make a mistake? And now they will 
throw me out of this house but Idrees I am telling you I won't leave this house, my grave will be 
made in this house, a very royal grave, beautiful grave, that’s it. Control yourself, Shaista. How should I control myself? Until when should I control myself? How many things should I control? I did so much for this property, for this business, for this house, I have tried so hard kill Arooj, I even put my son 
Salman in Mehreen’s lap and today, I would have killed that
 daughter of Arooj, Areej but But you forgot that Areej is also Salman’s daughter and Salman’s life is in his daughter. I don’t care she is his life. I can cross every limit for this property, for this business so much so that even if you come in between, so you know Shaista very well, I won’t stop. I have wasted so many years 
of my life for this property, and today, that Mehreen and Arooj 
became the owners of it. We have to leave 
this house, Shaista, I guess that is written in our fate. yes, I guess you are right, we are unfortunate, only Mehreen, 
Mehreen’s daughter Arooj, Arooj’s daughter, 
Areej are fortunate, all three of them are so lucky, such a huge accident took place, Waqar died but 
Mehreen didn’t die, she just turned psycho. This Arooj, whom Waqar named Areej, was 2 months old, I threw her in the trash
 by my own hands so the dogs could eat her but look at her luck, she got saved again and the amazing part is that she came in Salman’s
 life after so many years and then in our house, I put my son Salman in Mehreen’s lap 
only by thinking that I will get hold of all this 
property and business, but no and now this Areej, Arooj’s daughter Areej, even she is not dying, how lucky are all three of them. yeah. Salman, son, why are you looking at us like this? When a blind man 
gets eyes after ages, that’s how they look. But look carefully, there is only hatred in
 these eyes for both of you, nothing else but hatred. Look, Salman, Son… Don’t call me your son, don’t you dare call me your son, this word doesn’t look 
nice coming from your mouth. I feel disgusted by both of you. Salman, son, do you have
 any misunderstanding? Yeah? Misunderstanding? All the misunderstandings
 have been cleared today. Those parents who can give their son to someone
 else for the greed of money, they wouldn’t be called parents and the mother 
who can try to kill her ... ...granddaughter just for
 the sake of money, isn’t even worth being
 called a human being. Both of you are criminals and criminals get punished, and that will be today only. Salman? No, son, no, no. You don’t interfere. If a mother won’t interfere 
to save her son, then who else will? I won’t let my son’s hands get dirty by the dirty
 blood of these people. I don’t care about them, anyone can kill them, I just care about my son, I cannot see my son
 turning into a criminal, I don’t want to lose my son. Both of you should be ashamed, you gave such trouble to an affectionate
 person like her for so long? You tried to kill my daughter, you tried to kill my wife, I won’t leave you like this, you will get punished, and you will get
 punished at any cost. Yes Mr. S.P, Salman Waqar speaking, yes. Now our son even got out of hands, this property, this business, everything is gone, everything is gone and now, guess what? Now where will the rest of 
our lives be spent in this age? In the prison, in the prison. How funny, how funny is that? I am really sorry, Mom, I did very wrong to you. I don’t have any 
complaints from you, Salman. but I am guilty. I am not a good son. You are the only good
 one in this whole world. Don’t cry, you know I cannot see tears in your eyes. I am so desperate 
for motherhood that I will forgive you 
under all circumstances, but in reality, you are Arooj’s culprit, you have hurt her so much, if you want to apologize, go apologize to Arooj. You are right, I am her culprit too along with you, I have done so wrong to you all. Where is Arooj, I will go and apologize
 to her myself. I am your culprit, won’t you forgive your culprit? Arooj? Salman is sorry for his mistakes, do you see the tears in his eyes, these are the tears of regret. How should I trust
 these tears, Mom? These are the tears of guilt, Arooj and a mother recognized
 the tears of her son. If someone of your
 own apologizes, you shouldn’t take that long, you should answer
 love with love. You must also explain 
this philosophy to Salman. I don’t want to
 understand anything or explain anything because you explain to those you have some
 expectations from, and I don’t expect 
anything from Salman now. you are right, why would you expect 
anything from me? I am your culprit, and my mom and daughter’s. I have been 
disloyal to 3 generations, you are right, 
I don’t deserve to be forgiven. Salman, wait, Arooj, I admit, Salman must have 
made a lot of mistakes in life but he has also 
done good things, one of those good things is, falling in love with you. He is ashamed of his mistakes but he is still holding onto love. Mom, I have paid enough for love. So are all the debts paid? I still love you a lot and I always will. Forgive me if you can. Salman, stop.
