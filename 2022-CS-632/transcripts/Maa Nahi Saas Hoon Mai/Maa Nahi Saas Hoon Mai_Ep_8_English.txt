What is the matter? 
Why is everyone so quiet? Sister in law, Shaista, 
did you arrange a party for my son, so that everyone eats food 
in a sad environment. Hey, no, there is no sadness, 
lets all of us start eating. Salman, what will you have? 
Tell me? I… Wasai, pass me the kebabs, 
they are Salman’s favourite. Yes. Thank you. You know sister Shaista,
 you did great. You arranged everything 
so well for my Salman. What is the matter Urooj? You are eating food really half heartedly. No aunty, I am fine. Thank you aunt Shaista and Wasai, you really have a lot of taste 
in your hands. The food is really delicious. Thank you very much, little madam. Pass me the rice. You know aunt and 
uncle were really formal. I mean, so much staying 
in the same home. You tell me, how did you like this arrangement? Tea. Did you not make it for yourself? No, I don’t feel like it. Have a seat. You miss Urooj, right? I too miss her. Right now, only a few days have passed, but see, it feels like ages have passed seeing Urooj, meeting Urooj. She is our only daughter. As she left, she made 
the entire home vacant. I feel that she will come from 
this room right now, some times she will come from that room and she will tell me stories of her 
adventures as soon as she comes. Daughters have to sacrifice old love 
in search of new love. I am sure, Urooj will live really happy in that home. After all, who has brought her up? Okay, it is time for you to take credit. If the girls get praised, then 
the mother has brought them up and if there is a mistake, 
then the father spoiled them. Here, have tea. You drink it. You drink it. Urooj will be really happy. You too have it. 
Give it to me. Leave my hand. You didn’t answer me. I don’t have an answer. 
I have a question. What question? Will you be able to answer it? Go ahead, ask. The party that aunt arranged 
was for us, right? Obviously. 
Obviously, so aunt Mehreen ruined 
the entire environment. Urooj, don’t say anything about my mother. Why? After all, why can we 
not talk about this. If there is anything, any event, we have to go anywhere, 
come from anywhere, we have no personal life. Can we not have a personal life?
Urooj! I have no life without my mother, and you are talking about personal life? This is for the last time. After today, I shouldn’t have 
to make you understand. I know you are not happy. What you had thought couldn’t happen. Has it ever happened in all these years? One decision of mama, made my son someone else’s and now I am trying to get my small 
rights accepted. But it is not possible to refuse 
mama’s orders. So I had never refused it. To save Mehreen’s life, I considered my son Salman to be 
someone else’s child. It was not easy. Now it has started to feel 
even more difficult. Shaista, if you remember, then in mama’s order was the acceptance 
of your wishes. She unknowingly accepted your wishes. I had not made a wrong wish. Every mother in the world wants that 
her son owns everything. I too just wished that as well. Now Salman is the owner of everything,
the home, business, two factories and the shares. In return for that, it is right to consider 
Salman, as Mehreen’s son. Yes, so I accepted it. How else do I accept it? But the little happiness I want to achieve, Mehreen shouldn’t be a hurdle in it, that’s it. Then invite Salman and Urooj come 
to for a party some time. When will that ‘some time’ come? Exactly. Wasai. Yes, little madam. If you wanted something, 
you should have called me. Tell me, what do you want? No, I don’t want anything.
I just came. I am not used to sitting idle. You know, I have come from a full home. There I used to work in the kitchen 
all day long, I know how to cook. But, little madam, in this home, the owners don’t 
do the work in the kitchen, they order. and you think I will order you? Do you feel this way seeing me? No, little madam, you are a little different. And yes, you don’t be so formal with me, if madam hear is, she will mind it. Hey, what is this? How can someone get upset in talking 
to someone with respect? Wasai. Daughter in law, what are you doing here? Nothing aunty, I just came to the kitchen. Oh yes, I know, you are middle class, the kitchen is your final destination. But, now I have made arrangement 
for this too. What arrangement? Wasai, did you not tell Urooj? Now we will surely not need a chef, from today, you will take care 
of the kitchen. Oh wow, this is really good aunty. I will really like that I cook food 
for everyone. Not for everyone, for everyone else. Because I cook food for Salman myself. And I have not given anyone else, 
this right, okay? Sure. Work quickly, Wasai. Little madam, now there is no point in thinking. Only elder madam’s orders are followed, and everyone has to accept it. But there is one thing can be done 
against their will. What is that? That I make hot tea for you. No, today, you will make vegetables and 
I will make tea for you. But little madam…
I make really good tea. Have it and let me know. Urooj hurry up. The time you are taking makes me feel that
we are not going to reach for dinner, we will reach for breakfast. I am almost ready. By the way, mister looks in a really good mood today. What do you mean? Am I in a bad mood with you ever? No, no, mister is always in a good mood, it is never bad. So if you are ready, then shall we go? Let’s go. 
Let’s go. Listen. 
Yes? Why have you put on a 
dull color nail polish? Did you not have a bright color? Tell me, do you not know at all 
about fashion sense. Listen…
What do I listen to? Where are you going, Salman? Salman. Listen, I will change.. Salman. Salman. What is the matter? Why is Salman in a bad mood? I don’t know why he got in a bad mood, I will go call him. 
Stop. He is my son, I know well how his mood will get fine. I will call him myself. Yes, mom. Have a seat. Thank you. Like always, you have made 
a good choice. Nice place. Good. Mom, this is not my favorite restaurant, 
this is Urooj’s favourite. Should I order something? You know this is my favourite 
restaurant. Yes. 
I have come here so many times, that even the waiters would know 
what food I like. And thank you so much for bringing me 
to my favorite place. My pleasure. Fine, then, you order something good, 
okay? Fine. Salman, I didn’t find this special 
to be really special. I feel really suffocated. Lets go to some other restaurant. 
Aunty, the food here is really good. I am waiting for you people in the car, 
you people have dinner, till then I will sit in the car. Mom, listen to me. Just a second. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom, please listen to me. Why are you coming after me, Salman?
Go and enjoy. Mom, we came for dinner with you, how can we enjoy alone? When it a place of your wife’s liking, then how can you not enjoy? Mom, please, don’t get upset. 
Please, come. No Salman, now we will go home. Come on, let’s go home. But mom, we had to planned 
to come for dinner. We wanted to spend good time together. Yes, when have I told you not to? Just drop me home and 
spend your good time. Mom, you know, without you how can I have good time? Please, come on. Come on. My beloved mother. Yeah right, beloved. You just butter me. So how are your in-laws? In-laws? Everyone is really good. 
They really love you. By the way, child, 
who all is part of everyone? Everyone means, everyone, papa. Uncle, aunt, and even Wasai. And Salman’s mother? Aunt Mehreen? Aunt Mehreen, always keep an eye on me, What I am doing? Where I am going? what am I eating? what am I drinking? Meaning, she spies on you? Why? Mama, I am Salman’s choice and aunty really loves Salman. She loves him like crazy. Then child, she should also love you. You are Salman’s choice after all. You know if you look at it, papa, I have two mothers in laws. Aunt too loves me so much that it is difficult to differentiate between the two 
that who loves me more. You know this seldom happens, that even the aunt in law loves you. Mama, the thing is, your daughter is really lucky. You too have it, 
you won’t eat an apple. Our daughter is really lucky that she got such good in-laws. You are right. Come on. To save Mehreen’s life, I considered my son Salman to be 
someone else’s child. It was not easy. Now it has started to feel 
even more difficult. Shaista, if you remember, then in mama’s order was the acceptance 
of your wishes. She unknowingly accepted your wishes. I had not made a wrong wish. Every mother in the world wants that 
her son owns everything. Come in. Boss, I need your approval on this file. Listen Nawaz. Be careful. Boss, before today has Nawaz ever given 
you a chance to complain? Don’t worry. Greetings. Getting. Where is my son going so dressed up? Let me give him love, quickly or else if Mehreen sees it, 
then she will raise hell. I don’t think anyone will have 
a mother like mine. The home became so lively with 
your bride coming here. Before she came there was a weird 
silence in this home. I am going to get that life. Really? Then quickly go and come back. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Salman, where are you going now? You just came tired from the office. Yes, Urooj called, 
I am going to get her. Why? She has only been gone for two days. But she wants to come back. She is a weird girl. Girls after marriage go to their parents’ home
and stay for long. Are you happy sending Urooj 
to her parents’ home? Do you love Urooj love this much? No, I only love my son. Salman, the thing is that Mehreen thinks that Urooj should stay away 
from you for a few days. Why? So that your mama can shower 
her love on you. So I already I love my mama a lot. Yes, but now there is Urooj as well. Okay fine, mama. I will go. 
Wait Salman, you won’t go to get her. What do you mean I won’t go? Tell her to ask her father, 
he will drop her here. Are you her driver? Mama, she is my wife. 
What are you saying? You are tired, that’s why I am saying it. So what if I am tired? I told you, you won’t go, that’s it. Mom, please. She is my wife. It is my responsibility to bring her. Son, you know when she was young, then my phone would see the worst. I would keep the phone and 
go somewhere, she took my phone and run away. The two of would run after her. Papa, you tell him everything. It is good, we too should find out that you were 
really mischievous in childhood. Okay uncle, we will leave now. Hey son, so soon? Stay for some more time. Actually uncle, mom will be waiting 
at home, that’s why. Fine, son, if your mom is waiting then 
I cannot say anything. Salman, I will go get my bag. 
Okay fine. Come on, son, 
I will drop you to the gate. No uncle, leave it. 
We will go. Hey son, this way, we will spend 
some more time with you. Come. Come on. Come on. What I feared happened. This Urooj did what girls 
who marry out of love do. She made Salman hers completely. She is only making him go around her. I told him not to go to pick up Urooj, but he went. He went. He ignored what his mother said. Elder madam, I have brought milk for you. I don’t want it. I don’t want anything from here. 
Go from here. Leave. Sure Okay you go on, I will meet mama 
and come. Listen, thank you. What for? Mama and papa were really happy, 
especially after meeting you. Those people make a lot of arrangement. Trust me, if they get into so much formality, then I will stop going. Why don’t they make arrangements?
You are their only son in law, and then they also consider you their son. That is true. Okay, you go ahead, I will come 
after meeting mom. Mom, what is the matter? 
Why are you crying? Mom, tell me, what happened? I have realized, I no longer have any worth in your life. What are you saying? You are my life. You are my entire world. You only say this, you have taken me out of your life. Mom, how is this possible? Come on, tell me, what happened? I had told you. What? What? Don’t you remember? I had told you that you will not go 
to pick up Urooj. She could have come herself or someone 
from her home could have dropped her. Mom, you know, Urooj’s father is old, how would he have managed? 
That is why I went. Amazing, Salman. You bring justifications from God knows 
where for Urooj. Now I have realized, I have no worth in your life. That is never possible. I am the same Salman for you today. Your Salman. Okay come, stop crying now. I promise you, in future, you will not get a chance
to complain. You just don’t cry. Did aunty go to sleep? No. she is crying. She is crying? I will see. 
Stop.
