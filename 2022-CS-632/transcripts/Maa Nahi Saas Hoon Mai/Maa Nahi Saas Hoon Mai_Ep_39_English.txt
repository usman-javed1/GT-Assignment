What do you think, Salman? Is that Arooj as innocent 
in reality as she looks? I have an issue with a lot of things 
about Arooj, but, the reality is that she is that 
she is not bad character. You are mistaken. Okay fine, I can give you this concession too. When you had liked that Arooj, 
when you had chosen her for marriage, that Arooj of yours was simple, 
then, but now, since that boy Ammad has come 
to the office, since then Arooj has changed. And even brother Idrees noticed this. It is weird. Uncle said the same thing to me. Same to same. Okay, I will also admit that 
I am a mother-in-law, I don’t like Arooj, I can give a bad opinion about her, 
but is brother Idrees also lying? You are absolutely right. I will have to do something 
about this Ammad. This Ammad has caused cracks 
in our home. I know, you are thinking that 
Arooj won’t agree. There is an easy solution for this. You do one thing, 
end this office at home. This way, Ammad too will get fired and your Arooj will become 
the same as before. I don’t understand, how long this cold war
 will go on for, Salman. If you don’t talk, if you don’t answer me, then 
how will we find a solution? We will not find a solution to the issue 
with us talking. Then at least talk, we will find a solution for the problem
 together. When are you firing Ammad? I think we have spoken on this topic. Yes, but the discussion was incomplete. Because I had said no. You had said no, that is why 
it was incomplete. It will be complete when you fire Ammad 
from this office. Fine. You fire him yourself. Look, I am giving you respect in this company. You are the one who appointed Ammad, so now you will fire him too. Salman, I told you why I cannot fire him 
from the job. I don’t want to hear this. Fine, then don’t hear it. You signed two cheques today, right? You did, right? Do you know where this money went? I am the owner of this company, I can set fire to the money, why do you care? Because I cannot see you facing loss. I am your wife. Look, sit on one seat at a time, either become my wife, or become 
the director of finance. And if you want that you continue 
to be the director finance, and this office at home continues, then fire Ammad. And that is my final decision. Go ahead, Shanzay. Arooj, tell me, did brother Salman’s 
misunderstanding got removed or not? What? Are you kidding me? Is this time to ask me this question? Arooj, I saw you in my dream. You were walking straight and 
fell in the mud, and a lot of toads were there 
in that mud. Please, stop joking. I am already really worried right now. Joke? Fine, that thing about the toads was too much, but you find my dreams to be 
a joke too, right? Dreams are jokes. They look like the truth, and a lie in their reality. Are you serious? Salman has put the condition 
of firing Ammad. and if you don’t do that, then? Or else Salman will shut down the office. But he doesn’t know 
what I am going to do. If I quit the office at this moment, then I will never be able to unmask 
that man, who is harming Salman. Really? If this is true, then who is that man? Uncle. A wall of doubt has come 
between Salman and I. He thinks that I get frank with Ammad. If a misunderstanding remains for long, then it becomes a sorrow. Then maybe this sorrow 
cannot be removed. Arooj will not fire Ammad 
from the company, that is why Ammad should leave the job and save Arooj’s scattering home. But Ammad’s mother’s illness, Ammad’s job and his mother’s treatment will be 
taken care of, but if Arooj and Salman have a line 
of difference between them, then it will become difficult 
to cross it. Hello. Madam, how did you think of me 
early in the morning? Man, I couldn’t sleep all night. In whose memory were you awake?
Am I that lucky person. Don’t talk nonsense. I have called to talk to you 
about something serious. Oh please, don’t say that you are in love with me. Huh? You are mistaken. Okay. Okay. I was joking. Tell me, why did you call me? Your presence is creating a lot of 
difficulties in Arooj’s life. Arooj’s life is becoming difficult 
because of me, and I am still present there. Why didn’t Arooj not tell me? This is not just Arooj’s 
but also my insult. I cannot give anyone permission that someone looks at me like that. I will not tolerate this. Greetings. 
Greetings. Is Mr. Salman there? Yes, Mr. Salman is there. 
Fine, tell him, Ammad has come. Okay. Thank you. 
Thanks. Hello. 
Sir, Mir. Ammad has come. Send him in. Mr. Ammad, you can go. 
Mr. Salman is waiting for you. Yes, thank you. You are welcome. Greetings sir. 
Greetings. How are you, sir?
Are you fine? I am good. Sir, you know I have kept the money plant
 you gave me safe till now. Good, water it like this. It will become a tree one day. Excuse me. Hello sir. Sit. No, sir. I didn’t come here to sit. What do you want? Nicotine is injurious for health. I know what is right and 
wrong for me, well. So, stay in your limits. By the way, this is my resignation letter. I am resigning from the job. Thank you. Hello, Ammad. Hello Shanzay. Shanzay, I have resigned. What will happen now? Shanzay, I have come out of this quicksand 
of misunderstanding. Now I don’t know what will happen. Ammad, you have put yourself in difficulty,
by sacrificing your job for a better objective. I would still ask you how will you 
manage this all? Shanzay, the most beautiful things 
about difficult days is that they pass. But Ammad, mama’s ailment. God gave this ailment, 
so He will help. Ammad, you know you are a really brave man, and you will see that God will 
help you like this in future. Okay Shanzay, 
I will put down the phone. Okay. Fine, take care of yourself. Okay, bye. Smile Arooj. Ammad is asking you with 
so much affection, so you should smile. Boss, you… I shouldn’t have come? Did I disturb you people? No matter how dashing the boss is, you are never happy to meet them. Fatima. Good morning madam. 
Good morning. Where is Ammad? Madam, sir Ammad didn’t come today. Okay. He didn’t come to the office? Hello. Hello. Ammad, where are you? On the way. Okay fine, come to the office. No, I.. I am on my way home. What do you mean? 
You are not coming to the office? Hello? Yes. Yes, I…no, I am not coming. Actually, I have resigned. What? You resigned? Yes. But why? We had to do so much work together. I am sorry, Arooj. Actually, you know the thing is that mama stays really unwell. I am unable to take care of her, so I will have to take this step 
to take care of her. And, after all, I want to focus on her treatment. But how will you pay for the expenses
of aunt’s treatment? God is great. I will manage something. What can I say? I can only pray for your mother. Can I say something? You left me alone. I was going to stand up against these 
conspiring people on your basis. But anyway, no issue. Your reason is also valid in itself. Take care of yourself, goodbye. Goodbye. Boss, congratulations. 
Have sweet. You know, I have diabetes, 
I don’t have sweets. Boss, eat it. You eat so much, 
nothing happens, what will a bite of cake do? By the way, what is this for? Our wish got fulfilled. I am coming from the HR Department. Ammad resigned from 
the job and went. Really? That is great. But I don’t understand one thing, sir, why did Ammad resign 
and leave himself? If he hadn’t resigned, 
he would have been fired. You believe me now. I made it so suffocating that he found
it reasonable to run from here to breath. You know, boss, you are really smart. Tell me something, will madam Arooj stop her investigations 
after Ammad’s departure. She should stop it. The ruler doesn’t work themselves, 
the ones under them work. They neither have ears nor eyes. In fact, even the hands of 
his subordinate are used. You are right about that sir. Now we will do our deals openly. Exactly. Take this cake. May I come in, sir. Come in. Yes, sir, you called me? You do one thing, send an assistant to the finance 
office at home, madam Arooj has a need. Fine sir, we will send someone 
from the office. Perfect. So you do one thing, 
send Shahzad. Right, sir. I will send Shahzad today. One more thing, put up a post on social media 
that we need an assistant. Right sir. Thank you. 
Thank you. What is all this that happened? We were about to reveal 
the cheating of uncle and Ammad left. You didn’t do the right thing, Ammad. And on one hand, 
Salman was insistent on firing him, and see, we didn’t have to fire him. There is surely some complication. Little madam, your phone was kept there and 
it was ringing again and again. Hey, I am getting a call from 
Salman’s office, I will get a call back. What is the matter, little madam? You look worried. Don’t you get tired of asking the same
question again and again. You are right, I repeatedly ask you 
why you are worried. and you know the answer. Wasai knows everything. I just keep on asking so that the burden on your heart
can be reduced. Hello. Yes? No, I think I don’t need him.
I will tell Salman. Alright. Thank you. Hello. Salman, your receptionist called. She said you are sending 
some assistant? Yes, I have sent him. It will help you. Till the time new assistant is appointed, he will support you. No, thank you so much, 
I don’t want an assistant. Why don’t you want one? You have so much load on you, 
how will you manage? It is okay, the load is not that much,
I will manage. Even if you don’t have load, still. I am sending Shahzad, 
he is an experienced man. No, I don’t want to hire 
a male assistant, so don’t send anyone. What is this? Why don’t you want one? Nothing had happened till now. But if something happens again and after that I will have to give you
a justification of my character, and I don’t want that at all. Why? Did I say something wrong? No. But it is possible that he is not 
an old class fellow. Maybe he would be a person 
you would stay reserved with. You can say, you can think 
what you want, but don’t send anyone. If you send someone,
I will fire them. Goodbye. Arooj… What all do girls check at the time 
of the wedding, but they don’t know that a mother-in-law can be like Mehreen. This Arooj is so innocent. There is so much difficulty, but she doesn’t tell her parents. She is really patient. I am scared, that this oppressed girl might curse us, and even if she doesn’t curse us, still you get cursed for oppressing. Madam, your tea. Madam, what are you thinking? I am thinking about Arooj. That child’s life has so many issues. Madam, the issues you are thinking about, one of those issues has been sorted. Meaning?
Meaning, that boy, who little master used to hate… that, Mr. Ammad, he resigned from the job himself and left. How do you know this? I just heard it with my own ears and came. Fine, you leave. Sure. Okay, this turned out to be better for Arooj. I think we have prepared everything 
for the presentation tomorrow and if we get this project, all our bonuses will be due. So, I am looking forward. Amna will assist you in the remaining 
details, and… you see, I will come. You? Yes. 
Come. Arooj, didn’t your accountant 
Ammad come today? He resigned from the job. He resigned. This is really bad. He really needs money right now. That poor thing doesn’t have money 
to buy medicines. How do you know? I met him at the medical store. That poor thing didn’t have enough 
money to buy all the medication. If someone is affected by 
Mehreen’s hatred, then this happens to them. Then even if they are our own 
or a stranger. I am really disappointed to hear this. What are you doing here? Are you looking for something? I just came sister-in-law. You will not find who you are looking for. What do you mean, sister-in-law? The poison you put in Salman’s mind
because of Arooj, for a needy person, after that the boy left himself. Did he quit the job and go? Obviously, you had left him no option. A respectable person wants 
to save their respect, and for that it doesn’t matter 
how much loss they have to face. Why are you taking his side so much, 
sister-in-law? No, no, the time for taking 
sides has passed. Now only reward and punishment 
will be announced. Why are you telling me all this? What have I done? I just told Salman what 
brother Idrees told me. I will talk to Idrees, but you accept it that you didn’t 
do good with that boy. He is needy. He needed this job. I am amazed by you, Arooj. You turned out to be so cunning 
at such a young age. You didn’t like what I said? You shouldn’t like it either, 
even I want that. Aunty, I am working. It must be really difficult to work alone. Now that boy is not there either… what is his name? He has a smart name. Ammad.
