Mr. Judge, I want to inform this 
honourable court that my client Salman Ahmad is the owner of 
such a substantial property that keeping track of it is no easy 
task for anyone. Objection, your honour. The property my client, Arooj Ahmad, 
has claimed, my esteemed friend, cannot make the 
decision or bestow title for it to anyone. Your honour, I request the court that till the decision of the disputed 
property is not made, it shouldn’t be associated 
with anyone. The defending lawyer should ensure that the disputed property's title 
is not given to anyone. This is the job of the court to decide 
who owns this property. Understand? As your order, judge. Sir, the property is so substantial that
anyone can have greed in their heart, and anyone can claim it, and such a greed came in the heart
of Arooj Ahmad, and she filed a claim to take over the property
of her husband, that is, Salman Ahmad. I request the honourable court 
to reject this false claim, and save the precious time 
of the court. Thank you, your honour. This court orders both parties
 to appear in the next hearing with all their 
evidence and witnesses. The court is adjourned 
until tomorrow. The court is adjourned 
until tomorrow. Adjourned. Mr. Lawyer, what will happen on the next hearing? Your mother will have to testify, and you be a little patient. Look, these are decisions of ownership, it takes some time. It requires patience. We are being patient, Mr. Lawyer. Now, you may go home and 
finalize your statements. The opposing counsel might ask 
challenging questions, so be prepared. Questions that are even more 
challenging than life? Come on. The mother and daughter must 
not have paid enough fee, compared to the legal services 
you are offering them. Sir, this is my responsibility, and less or more fees makes 
no difference. There should be justice. You make a good speech, but if you support us, then I can pay you the amount 
you desire. Sorry, you are thinking wrong. It would be better if you let this case
remain in the court. What happened?
Did he agree? No. He is really strong,
he won’t break so easily. How will he not break? Salman Ahmad has broken the best, what is he? You don’t worry, I will fix it all. Come on, let’s come. Come on. Yes, the defendant’s lawyer would you like to inquire something
 from Arooj Ahmad? Sir, the property is so substantial that anyone can have greed 
in their heart, and anyone can claim it, and such a greed came in the heart 
of Arooj Ahmad, and she filed a claim to take over 
the property of her husband, that is, Salman Ahmad. I request the honourable court
to reject this false claim, and save the precious time 
of the court. This is more than what you had 
asked for. Understand? Here you go. But remember one thing, we only have to scare those two. We have a case against them in court. Don’t create a new issue. 
Understand? I understand, sir. What you said will happen. Hmm. I will go. Brother, drive fast. Brother, drive fast. 
Be quick. Someone is following us. Brother, take another route. 
Take a left from here. Mama, open the door quickly. Open it quickly. What happened? All okay? Come quickly. What happened? 
Tell me something. Why are you in such a hurry? Some goons were following us, 
mama. We saved our life with difficulty 
and came home. God be kind. Who were those people, and why were they after 
you people? Who else is our enemy other than…
Wealth. This wealth, was never that important 
for brother Idrees. For sister in law Shaista 
and Salman. That for the sake of which 
these people have fallen below the standards
of humanity. Earlier they only had a doubt that all 
this would be snatched from them. But now, they are sure of it. They are sure? Yes, they are sure. Earlier, they only had a doubt
about this, that all this will become theirs. But today? Today, when the court proceedings 
took place, then their doubt changed into surety that all this is going to be snatched 
from them really soon. Okay, thank God, you two didn’t face any loss. We have faced a loss, 
sister Naseema. The loss of love. The loss of trust being broken. Child, Arooj, have a seat. I will bring water for both of you. You could be so cheap that 
you got goons to follow us. Stop your nonsense. You dislike every person 
who is speaking, and you dislike them 
even more especially if they are speaking the truth. And what do you think? 
Huh? You will pay and buy anyone? What are you saying? 
Who did I buy? My lawyer. Yes, so I can buy him. You cannot buy him. Really? How can you stop me? Did you forget that I am the owner of this wealth
 and property. This dream of yours will be 
shattered soon. You are the one who is dreaming
 Mr. Salman. Maybe you are forgetting that my father put the entire property and
business in my name when he died. And I will bury this reality in the ground. Great. You know this reality, 
but you don’t accept it. Don’t worry, I will make you accept it really 
soon as well. We will see. Now, do you understand how you 
became the heir of the entire property and business after Arooj’s 
disappearance? I will go mad. No. You don’t have to go mad, 
you have to use your senses. Arooj is a really cunning girl and also the owner of entire 
businesses and properties. But she is my wife. She is Mehreen’s daughter. Now when the reality has 
been revealed, then you don’t even expect any good
 from Mehreen, either. And Arooj will stand with her mother
in such a situation. Son, Salman. What happened? Who were you talking to with 
so much anger? With Arooj. What is she saying now? She is saying the same nonsense, that I am fighting a case against her, 
with her money. Really? Is this what she said? So why did you listen to her? You should have cut the phone. I was about to cut it,
but she cut it first. Strange. Why is she calling now? I would say, you tell this in court. I spoke to the lawyer. He said, she is your wife,
she can call you. Hah, wife. This thorn will also be removed
 soon as well. Don’t worry, okay? They should worry, not us. Yes. Yes, Mr. lawyer, end all this 
in the hearing tomorrow. They have no proof that can prove
Arooj to be the owner. Fine. Fine, we will meet 
in the court tomorrow. Let us just win this case once, then the stamp of our ownership 
will be on everything. Don’t worry, we are in a strong position. The lawyer was saying that he will thrash every witness of Arooj. 
Yes! And who is Arooj’s witness? Her mother, Mehreen, 
who else? That’s it? This case will be ours. You people will see. Papa? Leave it. I will close it. Have you seen your health? Where are you going around? Hey child, I went to meet 
the counsellor. What is the need to meet 
the counsellor? Hey, there was a need. I went to ask him for his car. I told him the entire matter. He gave me a driver and a guard
along with the car. Now we will go with him. No, you will rest at home. Master, Arooj is right. You go inside and rest. Okay fine, go. You are getting late for court. 
The counsellors car is parked outside. Mama, you kept your medication, right? Yes, I forgot, it is kept in the drawer. I will bring it. By the way, Master at times I am really happy that you and sister Naseema 
brought up my Arooj. You find the solution for every 
for every problem that comes in Arooj’s path, 
so easily. All parents do this, sister Mehreen. No Master, us parents who live in bungalows 
don’t face these daily challenges. When do we have this service 
of the children in our fate. Serving the children? Yes, master. You have to serve the children as well. That’s when children serve the parents 
when they grow up. You have to take care of the plant, 
to get the fruit. Shall we go, mama? Yes. Goodbye. 
Goodbye, child. Begin the proceedings of the case. Mr. Judge, I would like to draw the esteemed
court’s attention to a crucial point. Arooj Ahmad has claimed ownership 
of her property, but no document has been presented
from the inheritance side that could substantiate Arooj Ahmad’s 
ownership claim. What response does the prosecution
have for this? Mr. Judge, the point my learned 
friend has brought to the court’s attention is 
extremely crucial, and we cannot overlook it. 
However, it seems there may be a misunderstanding
that we have overlooked it. It would be better if you speak in simple 
words instead of using complex language. Mr. Judge, I mean to say that we didn’t forget the importance
of the papers. Rather, it is a story based on the lack 
of authenticity of those documents. No, we are hearing stories. There is no reality in this. Mr. Judge, I want permission to call 
my client Arooj Ahmad to the witness box in regards 
to these papers. Permission granted. Come, Arooj. Yes, madam, go ahead, 
what do you want to say? Mr. Judge, since the property papers were 
in my name, and they were present in the same 
home where we live. These people who have taken over
 this home also live there. Papers getting lost or stolen from 
that home is nothing impossible. Objection, Mr. Judge. I don’t understand how Arooj Ahmad is putting an allegation 
on my client Salman Ahmad and Idrees Ahmad for stealing 
a document that doesn’t exist? So, the defendant’s lawyer, 
is it not possible? Madam Arooj’s objection does 
not seem entirely wrong. It is possible that at some stage, the ownership document was removed. Arooj, you will go crazy putting in effort, but you will not be able to prove anything. No one can remove me from this wealth. All this is mine. Only, mine. Yes, so Mr. Salman Ahmad, you and your lawyer have been 
trying to prove from day one, that my client Arooj Ahmad is not the owner of her 
father’s property. Really? So what do you think? 
Arooj is the owner of all this? I would say, absolutely. I want to bring something 
in the court’s notice, that is, Mr. Salman Ahmad and 
his father Idrees Ahmad have taken control of the entire property
 by using a piece of paper, which is a caretaking document, 
as the basis for the past twenty years. Yes, so that’s how it is. All this belongs to my late uncle. This reveals two things. Firstly, you are not the owner 
and secondly, when Waqar Ahmad’s wife, 
Mehreen is alive, then why is she not the owner 
of this entire property?
