[62.24] Why did you come here?
[69.56] To meet you.
[73.76] Why do you want to meet me?
[81.68] What is the reason?
[84.80] Why are you not meeting me?
[89.32] Say what you have 
come here to say.
[98.56] I know well,
why you have come here.
[107.04] So, it will be better for you 
to tell me clearly.
[114.36] How can you talk to me like this?
[119.12] Really?
[121.88] So, now you will teach me
 how I should talk.
[131.32] Tell me,
[134.36] what have you come here for?
[138.44] Salman,
[142.32] you kept on walking on the terrace 
all night long.
[152.60] You didn’t even come to the room.
[156.88] I know you are worried.
[171.08] Won’t you share it with me?
[172.72] Why should I share it with you?
[175.48] Because I am your wife.
[178.88] Wife?
[183.00] You are only aunt Mehreen’s daughter.
[208.76] Okay,
[213.52] so you have found out.
[229.96] I had thought I would tell you myself,
[235.32] but you had promised me that
[238.84] you will help me in finding my parents.
[244.16] Forgive me, considering it a mistake.
[262.32] How can you be so stone hearted?
[265.68] She loves you so much. You know,
[268.44] she has not slept for two nights. 
So, what do I do?
[273.52] I have not taken up the responsibility
of showing mercy on someone.
[279.48] Salman.
[291.04] She is not someone.
[301.20] She has loved you for 
twenty-five years.
[312.96] She is your mother,
[315.44] and you are still calling her
aunt Mehreen.
[329.92] Really?
[332.60] So you tell me.
[334.96] Tell me,
[336.88] what should I call her
if I don’t call her aunt Mehreen?
[346.80] Someone else has brought 
me up as well.
[358.96] But I still consider her 
my mother till today.
[364.96] It is not necessary that 
I think the same way as you.
[443.28] I am really sorry, man.
[446.52] I don’t know what happens to me,
[449.36] and then everything gets ruined.
[456.72] This is my fault.
[459.36] I admit it.
[462.68] Right now, I want to
[467.08] stay here with my parents.
[471.96] But, why?
[476.64] I have to search for my parents.
[482.00] I get lost in myself going
 to that home,
[485.60] then how would I be able 
to search anyone else?
[488.80] So, I will help you find them.
[491.28] I am with you.
[504.28] I am really sorry.
[509.84] My information turned out 
to be wrong
[513.16] and that family was 
not your family.
[517.00] Your hope broke.
[520.32] What are you saying?
[523.88] You tried, you supported me.
[528.64] Rest is up to fate.
[530.72] I am really hopeful that
[533.52] you will find your family soon.
[540.44] I will go now.
[544.48] Take care of yourself.
[549.28] Listen,
[553.52] thank you,
[555.92] for trying for me.
[666.76] Arooj.
[670.24] Did you meet Salman?
[672.08] How was your meeting?
[675.32] I don’t know what has happened?
[677.56] He is not ready to hear anything.
[681.04] Now this puppet show is over.
[687.04] Salman will not listen to you 
or Mehreen,
[690.64] because he has learned
[692.48] that I am his father and 
Shaista is his mother.
[696.32] Even if Salman has found out 
about this,
[699.20] then what is the reason for hating 
my mother and I?
[703.04] Very smart.
[704.76] You have found out really soon 
that Salman hates you.
[708.32] Yes, but why?
[710.00] It is better that you don’t get 
into this argument,
[712.92] and prepare to leave from 
Salman’s life, now.
[717.76] What are you saying?
[719.76] I am Salman’s wife.
[721.64] More than that you are 
Mehreen’s daughter.
[724.80] Okay,
[726.92] so Salman is speaking 
your language.
[731.28] See how you are talking
[734.36] and Shaista will stop 
this tongue on yours,
[737.68] because you are her 
daughter-in-law
[739.28] and she is your mother-in-law.
[767.72] I have not taken up the responsibility
 of showing mercy on someone.
[771.80] She has loved you for 
twenty-five years.
[779.00] She is your mother,
[781.44] and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen.
[785.12] Really?
[787.72] So you tell me.
[789.88] Tell me,
[791.88] what should I call her if I don’t 
call her aunt Mehreen?
[798.88] Someone else has brought 
me up as well.
[807.28] But I still consider her 
my mother till today.
[813.20] It is not necessary that 
I think the same way as you.
[849.32] A game has been played 
with my life.
[859.32] I have been afflicted by a really 
deep oddity, in a moment.
[866.28] I am trying hard to understand
 your emotions,
[871.20] but I am unable to understand.
[874.72] I am in a lot of pain.
[878.00] I am unable to focus in any work.
[884.48] I hate everything, every relation 
seems meaningless to me.
[888.52] Salman, sister-in-law too went
 through a similar situation.
[895.56] She too has gotten a grip 
on herself with difficulty.
[897.44] No, man, she disappeared, 
she got lost.
[901.28] My own parents handed me 
over to someone else.
[904.88] How do I accept it?
[908.08] Salman, I agree to 
everything you say,
[911.64] I just don’t understand
[917.44] what is the reason to hate 
sister-in-law, Arooj?
[920.48] I hate myself, how will I 
hate someone else?
[927.28] Anyway,
[929.68] I won’t be able to sit anymore.
[931.64] Salman, sit, man.
[934.44] A little longer, please. Salman.
[954.80] Now tell me,
[956.40] what you feel after hearing 
all that I said?
[959.84] Will Salman leave me?
[962.24] Arooj, I don’t understand 
brother Salman at all.
[965.00] Earlier he used to listen 
to aunt Mehreen,
[967.40] and now his parents.
[975.24] Why doesn’t he think 
anything himself?
[978.60] I don’t understand 
what Salman wants.
[984.24] Arooj, I feel he is going through 
a big shock,
[988.36] you should let him be.
[1002.28] Will doing this be right?
[1005.88] Man,
[1007.72] that’s what I believe in.
[1010.52] And if things get further out of hand?
[1019.32] Pray for me, Shanzay.
[1021.96] My heart is really worried.
[1025.08] Okay, you don’t worry.
[1031.36] You know you are a really brave girl.
[1034.28] Nothing will happen.
[1046.04] I will leave for home, then.
[1048.16] Areej is alone at home, 
I have left her with mama.
[1050.72] She must be waiting.
[1051.96] Man, you should have stayed 
for a while.
[1053.96] Have tea.
[1055.36] Some other time.
[1059.64] Take lots of care of yourself. 
No need to worry.
[1063.60] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[1145.36] Salman.
[1152.28] It is good that you came, son.
[1159.00] I was waiting for you, 
for a long time.
[1166.64] Don’t mind,
[1169.12] I was waiting for you.
[1175.32] There is no need for you 
to wait for me.
[1178.72] What is wrong, Salman?
[1181.40] You can talk to me with 
love as well.
[1185.20] After all, for years…
[1186.72] What had to happen, what had to pass,
 has passed.
[1189.60] Now you don’t need to drag me
in my past, aunt Mehreen.
[1203.72] Aunty?
[1211.80] You called me aunty?
[1216.68] Yes, I did.
[1219.24] And I will call you the same 
in future as well.
[1228.72] All of you.
[1230.16] Especially you.
[1232.16] You ruined my life.
[1234.56] To save your life, you took away 
my entire childhood.
[1238.40] Salman. 
Stay away.
[1240.56] Go away from me.
[1247.80] There is no need for you to come 
near me in future.
[1250.76] Salman.
[1258.80] You have found your daughter,
[1272.28] save these emotions for her.
[1310.24] Did you see, Mehreen,
[1315.72] how I played the entire game,
[1318.84] and I also won.
[1328.52] What did you win?
[1332.76] How I took back my son from you,
[1336.56] that too with full profit.
[1342.72] My son, Salman,
[1346.72] is the only owner of this entire 
property and business.
[1362.56] So,
[1364.24] you are admitting it yourself
[1368.04] that you did this cheap action?
[1374.56] You will get the answer for this
[1380.08] when Salman will be left with me,
[1382.84] and you will be all alone.
[1388.68] I couldn’t even think
[1393.44] that someone can plan 
so mercilessly.
[1399.52] Please,
[1400.88] keep these dialogues of yours 
to yourself.
[1411.16] You know, should I tell you
 the truth?
[1413.80] I feel bad for you.
[1418.04] Mehreen, you have become
so helpless.
[1442.00] I am not your son,
[1444.36] and neither are you my mother.
[1452.44] In future, don’t call me your son.
[1520.76] Mama.
[1527.12] Mama, what happened?
[1531.96] Did someone say something?
[1534.52] Tell me.
[1536.24] Salman.
[1540.16] Salman has started to hate me.
[1545.04] Salman shouldn’t hate me, 
no issues.
[1549.92] But don’t hate me either.
[1554.72] I didn’t let him leave my lap 
for a lot of years,
[1559.12] and today,
[1560.96] when I want to extend my hand 
and touch him,
[1564.92] he shuns me away.
[1568.32] So, why are you expecting 
love from him?
[1571.56] I am not expecting it, 
I am begging for it.
[1574.48] Stop it, mama. Stop it.
[1578.88] Surely, you are telling me less.
[1582.80] I know Salman well.
[1585.72] When he starts misbehaving, 
he doesn’t care.
[1589.16] I will take care of him right now. 
No Arooj.
[1594.00] No,
[1595.68] you will not say anything 
to Salman.
[1599.36] When do you get love, 
asking for it?
[1606.80] If he doesn’t care for you,
[1610.32] then I am here,
[1612.36] your daughter.
[1618.88] Will your daughter not be enough 
to satisfy your desire for motherhood?
[1715.76] Salman, do you know why 
I gifted you this watch?
[1719.92] Why?
[1721.24] So that you can look at the time 
and come home early next time.
[1726.92] In fact, there is another special 
thing about this watch.
[1730.96] Really?
[1732.36] What is that?
[1733.72] I have set everyone’s birthday 
alarm in this watch.
[1738.88] Really?
[1740.52] But I am not interested in remembering
 anyone’s birthday.
[1745.28] I just want to remember your birthday.
[1752.04] I knew it,
[1754.04] that is why only your and my reminder
is set in this watch.
[1759.84] Really?
Yes.
[1765.76] Thank you so much Arooj,
[1768.00] for making my day.
[1772.56] You know what?
Yes?
[1775.16] I love you so much
[1777.12] I love you too.
[1798.48] Little master,
[1800.16] I have kept your tea.
[1802.56] Come on, come and have it.
[1805.00] Where did you keep it?
[1806.92] The same place you drink it 
daily in the evening.
[1814.16] I will never go there now.
[1820.76] Bring my tea here.
[1823.80] Sure.
[1839.68] Here you go, your gift.
[1842.72] Mom, what is this?
[1844.64] Open it and see for yourself.
[1867.84] How do you like it?
[1871.52] Mom, this is…
[1873.00] This is really cute, aunty.
[1875.36] You gave a really good present
to Salman.
[1879.72] You know Salman,
[1881.56] this is the gift from 
your first birthday.
[1886.36] Thank you again, mom.
[1888.84] Love you.
[1915.08] Hello.
[1916.36] What is the problem, Mussarat?
[1917.56] Why are you calling me 
again and again?
[1918.96] I have told you, I am home, 
don’t you understand?
[1921.80] How are you talking to me, Idrees.
[1924.48] I am your wife, not your maid.
[1927.92] Okay. Okay. Don’t mind. 
Tell me, what is the matter?
[1930.44] I don’t want anything.
[1932.44] Your son is insisting that call papa,
[1934.88] I want to go for an outing.
[1936.32] Hey you handle him. 
How can I come right now?
[1939.40] I have told him this already,
[1941.20] get a grip on yourself son,
[1946.84] because your father has been taking
 us for a ride for so long,
[1950.60] by lying to us repeatedly.
[1953.40] You know coming over daily is not easy.
[1955.80] I am busy here.
[1958.16] Idrees, you had told me that after 
marriage, you will shift to Karachi,
[1962.08] or you will call me to you
in Islamabad.
[1970.88] Here, our son has turned ten,
[1974.20] and you have not fulfilled 
any promise of yours.
[1981.96] Tell me,
[1983.16] do you have an answer for all this.
[1986.44] Okay. Okay. Be quiet now.
[1987.76] I will come over to your place
in a day or so,
[1989.16] we will sit and talk comfortably.
[1991.28] Yes. Yes.
[1993.28] I have told my PA, 
he will email you.
[1997.20] Don’t worry, 
you work will be done.
[1998.88] Yes, absolutely. Absolutely.
Okay. Okay.
[2001.16] Goodbye.
[2003.92] Hey, Shaista.
[2005.72] All okay?
[2006.92] Who are you talking to standing
in the corner here?
[2011.16] There were no signals,
[2013.48] that’s why. Come on. 
Sure.
[2021.76] Fine, Idrees.
[2024.12] This time you come to Karachi,
[2027.64] we will talk to face to face this time.
