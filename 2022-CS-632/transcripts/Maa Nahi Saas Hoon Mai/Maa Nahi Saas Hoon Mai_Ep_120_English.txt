I can say with surety that this girl Arooj’s desire is nothing
but greed for wealth and lies. Okay fine, we will accept for 
a few moments that the testimony of both the women is true 
and the copy of the stamp paper is fine. As for being the daughter of Waqar Ahmad
 and Mehreen Ahmad, who went missing twenty-two 
years ago, it was when Arooj Ahmad 
married Salman Ahmad and came to this home that she heard the story 
of a lost girl. She had greed in her mind, then she started getting herself called 
as a lost child, to seize the entire wealth. What will we do now, Arooj? Do whatever you want, it will be of no benefit. I will deprive you people of 
every single penny. There is still time Arooj, plead forgiveness from me. Who knows, I might forgive you. Salman, I know that I will win this case. But I will not be happy on 
winning this case. Whatever is going to be mine 
because of this win was never the target of my life. But, if you still win, then you will lose everything,
even after winning. Oh my God. I wish. I wish I was there, then I would have seen Arooj’s
and Mehreen’s long faces. What were those two idiots thinking that defeating Shaista is so easy? No, not at all. Shaista doesn’t have
the word ‘defeat’ in her dictionary. You do one thing, you come with us 
to the hearing day after tomorrow. See the drama that unfolds when 
the court’s decision in our favour. Arooj and Mehreen will have 
no respect left. You know, she acts so innocent and she is fighting a case 
against us? Hah, if I tell you the truth, at times 
I want to scratch both their faces. Whose face are you talking 
about scratching? Hey, Salman is also here. 
Come. Have some sweets son. 
Go ahead, have some sweets. No. Why? What happened? I will have sweets, the day Arooj 
comes back to this home crying. What do you want to do, Salman? Once we win this case, then I will file another case on them. Case for what? Anything. I just want that I drag Arooj 
to the court. My heart will find a lot of peace. Oh, revenge. Revenge. So, then you come for the 
hearing day after tomorrow. No, I will stay here and celebrate
our victory. Okay, as you wish. I am the owner of this business,
property and wealth. And I know this well. So my advice to you is, stop dreaming about it. It is just a matter of me going 
to the court, I will ruin the plan you made for
twenty five years in minutes. Arooj, don’t give up. Life is the name of fighting,
and constantly fighting. I am fighting, papa. But I had no idea those people 
would be so deceitful and cunning. You know, now I feel disgusted
 with myself, that how did I live in between 
such people for so long. Child, this is the world. Here wealth has become 
the faith for most people. They do not adhere to 
ethical principles when it comes to acquiring wealth
and resources. Yes, but a person has something
called conscience in them. Does that not bother them? Look, my daughter, this world is a place of lessons. People here may have 
a conscience, but it often turns into 
a lifeless body. And this is why their actions stink. Hmm, okay, how will you proceed? What will you do? I am thinking of that way. So do you see a way? You say yourself, if you stand strong on the path of honesty,
God makes the way Himself. That’s it, I am living on the hope 
of that light or else there is darkness 
all around. This darkness will get removed,
just stay strong. There is always a day 
after every night. Stop it now, Wasai. How long will you massage it for? No, elder madam, don’t stop me today. I got a chance to serve you 
after a long time. What are you looking 
at elder madam? When am I elder madam now? I have been sent away 
from my home. Don’t say that. I am completely sure, you will surely go back to 
that home one day. How are you sure, Wasai? God bless my mother. She used to say that the thing that belongs to a place, surely returns to it. And your place is in 
Mr. Waqar’s home. Wasai, how can people hide their 
cunningness for so long and meet others with a smile 
on their face, like, sister in law Shaista and 
brother Idrees did. People have a lot of colours. Like a chameleon. It took changes so many colours. When mama and Waqar were there,
that home was so lively. But, the greed of brother Idrees and 
sister in law Shaista ruined it. Okay don’t cry, be strong. Look at younger madam, she is competing with everyone so 
bravely, at such a young age. Yes, Wasai. Maybe, my daughter has been through
so much sorrow in this age, that maybe she feels no pain now. First me, her unlucky mother couldn’t protect her. I couldn’t keep her with me. Then I became her bad mother in law. I have given my daughter 
so many sorrows, right? No, elder madam, don’t say that now. What will you get by cursing 
yourself, now? A person can also make amends 
for their mistakes. You are right. Okay, tell me, when are you going to your village? No, no, elder madam, now I will not go anywhere. I will just lie here in some corner, with you people. I will serve you people all my life. I will not leave you people and go. I won’t go. Mr. Judge, this report 
clearly states that Mehreen Ahmad is a mental patient. Whatever stories she has told us, she has just wasted 
the court’s time with it. There is nothing in it 
that can be believable. Mama, I am going for some work. Where are you going, child? To do the most important thing 
of my life. I don’t understand. Maybe no one understands. I... I needed some money. Yes, yes, why not? I have taken out money for you. All the money I had was spent 
in the lawyer’s fees, mama. I have no money left to spend. Here you go. Did I ask for any clarification? I don’t need any reason to fulfill 
the need of my Arooj. It is not enough, right? Child, that’s all I have right now. Okay, wait a minute,
I will just come. Here you go. Sell it. Take it. Mama, if I win the case, I will get two more made for you. God is great, child. You, leave. Thank you. Goodbye, go. May God give you courage, my child. My Lord, help my daughter. The two witnesses Arooj presented 
to prove her innocence, they are in front of you. One of them is a mental patient, and the other has an allegation 
of theft on her. Apart from that, she has a 
copy of a paper, according to which 
she is the owner. And even the original document for 
that has still not been found, Mr. Judge. Shall we go, mama? Arooj, at least tell me 
where we have to go. We don’t even have a hearing
at the court, today. We have to go prepare 
for the hearing. You come with me. Nasir. Nasir. What is this, Salman? 
This is my office and I have respect here. So, this is also my life and I too have
a lot of respect in my life. Talk openly and it would be better 
if you say it straight. It is something simple, it is you who is helping Arooj 
fight the case, right? All this money is coming 
from your office, right? Because the poor master Shoaib 
doesn’t have enough money to spend on the case. You are the one who is poor, Salman. Why are you surprised? You heard it right. 
You are the one who is poor, who doesn’t have relations,
nor friends. You are actually poor. I didn’t come here to hear 
your philosophy. Talk straight with me. What did you come here 
to say, then? I came to warn you. Stop helping Arooj financially. I am not helping sister in law Arooj,
financially. In fact, she is helping us. You had taken back tenders worth
ten million, right? In return sister in law Arooj brought our 
company three times bigger the business. Who is helping whom, now? 
Will you tell me? And it is also the responsibility
of the company to care for such employees,
that are worthy. I will surely deal with Arooj, but I will also deal with you. But I will never consider you 
my enemy. My friend. Sister in law, Arooj, I have transferred
 some money in your account. Please check. Okay. What have you brought, Shaista? The corpse of the desires and 
hopes of Mehreen and Arooj. I thought I would look at it for a while
and shed tears for a while. Tears of happiness! You really know how to enjoy 
the situation, Shaista. You know, I want that I take this picture and give it 
in Arooj’s hand. Go madam, you want to become the owner 
of this wealth and home on the basis of 
this picture, right? Then fine, go present this picture in the court, and say that this infant is me, then you will get everything.
That’s how it is right? Hey, stop it, already. How long will you celebrate
your victory? Huh? All my life. I will celebrate it all my life. I wish. I wish, this was a film or a drama, then these two would have showed
this picture in the court. Begin the proceedings of the case. Legal representative of 
the defendant, please present all the evidence 
against Arooj Ahmad, who claims the ownership of 
the deceased Waqar Ahmad, so that this case can be 
concluded today. Please proceed. Thank you, your honour. Mr. Judge, before my closing argument, I would surely want to call 
Arooj Ahmad here. Permission granted. Mr. Judge, my client Salman Ahmad 
is a reputable businessman and a highly esteemed individual. Upon his recommendation, I have given Arooj Ahmad 
a final opportunity to retract her false claim, 
expressing regret, and gracefully withdraw from 
and take back this case. And not only will there be a 
prosecution case against her, but also, simultaneously, 
she will be liable to pay a penalty for defamation against the 
honourable family of Salman Ahmad. Mr. Judge, I stand strong on 
my claim even today. I am the owner of this entire property. This means, now Arooj Ahmad will have 
to give evidence that she is late Waqar Ahmad’s daughter. Otherwise, our case is straight. Thank you. Mr. Judge, what will they forgive me for 
conspiracy and defamation. I forgive these people. Mr. Judge, this is Arooj Ahmad’s DNA report. According to it, Arooj Ahmad is the daughter of 
Waqar Ahmad and madam Mehreen. Thus, there is no doubt. And along with that there is also 
madam Mehreen’s medical report as well, which clearly states that
she is mentally fit, thus, her testimony cannot be denied and that is already 
in the court’s record.
