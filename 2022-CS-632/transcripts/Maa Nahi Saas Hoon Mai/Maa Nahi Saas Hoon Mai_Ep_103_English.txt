Arooj. You came suddenly. You didn’t even inform us 
before coming. If we knew something, 
we would have told you. Arooj, is everything fine? Papa, that… Sister, Mehreen, you tell us, what is the matter? 
Is all okay? Actually, we left that home and came. You left that home? What happened, Arooj? There was no space left for us to live in that hatred filled 
environment. Mama was really scared that my life and Areej’s life could be
 in danger living there. Master, find a solution. Arooj is constantly crying. She is not even able to sleep 
for a moment. This way, she will fall ill. I am thinking of how this problem can
be solved in a reasonable manner. You think that after the worst behaviour
 of Salman and his family we will be able to find a 
reasonable solution. Yes, I have faith this will happen. They dragged them out of the home. They snatched the daughter. Master, I think you should take 
the help of the law. Naseema, if I get disappointed, 
then we will go to the law. A lot of time will pass like this. It is a question of two lives. On one hand there is our Arooj and on the other Areej. You are right. After going to the court, the door for negotiation closes and also the way to return. If you are thinking that Salman will take Arooj, then you are wrong. No, this is possible. He dragged Arooj out of the home, and you are still mistaken. This is the limit. Naseema, it is really painful for decent girls to go 
to the police station and visiting courts. I will do something. You go and console Arooj. My heart is really restless. I don’t know what condition 
Areej would be in, would she have eaten or not. I am really worried. Don’t worry like this, child. Her grandmother will take care of her. Salman is so cruel. He didn’t even think how such a small
child will live without her mother. Areej should be with me 
right now, mama. You didn’t do the right thing. This is injustice. A daughter is with her father, what is unjust in this? 
What did I do wrong? What is wrong is that right now she 
should have been with her mother. So, she is with her mother. With my mother. She will die without her mother. She will die? I didn’t die without my mother, that Arooj didn’t die without 
her mother. Salman, if something happened
 accidentally, what enjoyment do you want to 
drive by applying it to yourself? I don’t want to enjoy anything. I want to humiliate Arooj, 
I want to give her pain. Sister in law Arooj has no fault. It is her fault. She came in my life, 
she ruined it. You are forgetting one thing 
in your anger and disgust. And this is the biggest flaw 
of anger. What? What am I forgetting? That sister in law Arooj 
was your love and you married out of love. I made a mistake that I loved her. I have forgotten everything. Salman, you are trying to see 
things as per your wish, and it will not have a good result. I came here to talk to you about 
what was in my heart, but you really like being a philosopher.
Fine, then, sit here. Salman, listen to me. 
I don’t want to hear anything. Salman. Salman. He is not doing as he says. While acting he has forgotten 
how to behave with Arooj. Your parents are really smart,
 Salman. They have taken advantage of 
this naivety of yours. You have gone to take revenge
for something in which the one in front of 
you is innocent. Wasai, why did aunt come here? I don’t know. You are at peace, right? I don’t like it at all. You will find the marks 
of the slaps you hit on my face 
on your existence. She is my daughter. 
I say, leave her. I will not let you bring her up. Leave her I say. 
Give her to me. Leave her. 
She is my daughter and I will not let you bring her up. Salman, son, don’t do that. We will sit and talk. 
Come. The time to sit and talk has passed. Leave her, I cannot live without her. Why can you not live without her? Did you not live without your mother? She is my daughter, 
she will live with me. You cannot do this. 
Salman, stop. Salman! What sort of fate is this, that wants to repeat itself 
again and again? I was deprived of my mother’s lap and Salman… Salman couldn’t get his 
mother’s lap. And now my daughter? My daughter was separated
 from my lap. No, the fate of my daughter and 
I cannot be similar. It cannot be. That’s it, not anymore. Now no one can distance me 
from my daughter. Salman, I will take back my daughter
 from you at all cost. And if you don’t give her to me, then this is a mother’s promise. Even if I have to snatch 
my daughter from you, then I will snatch her, but I will surely... bring back my Areej. Hello. You are back, is Salman still in office? Salman seldomly comes 
to the office. Really? Then he must go out 
for meetings? It is not that. He goes out, 
he has outings. That is really good. Let him enjoy. This burden has been removed 
from his head after so long. This is the time he has to enjoy. After all, why does he need to work? 
He has employees to work for him. Where is Areej? Lower your voice, 
she will wake up, and she will put my life 
in difficulty. She cries all the time, 
just like her mother. I cannot take care of her. So why have you stopped Chandu? She is here for my work, not to take care of her. And whose responsibility is Areej? Her mother's. Meaning, if the mother is the enemy,
then the daughter is also your enemy. You are really tough. What do you think? I kept her in my love? Not at all. I have only kept her here, so that I can torture Arooj 
and Mehreen. Okay, you leave all this. You come and sit, I have to talk to you
 about something important. Come on. Don’t you think, Salman has changed a little. He has become really bitter. He has even started 
misbehaving with us. He didn’t do this earlier. What do you want to say, Shaista? I feel Mehreen and Arooj have got 
magic done on Salman. This is the limit Shaista, 
there is nothing like that. You can note this done, I am sure there is 
something like that. Shaista, I already have 
to think a lot, now you are putting me 
on another path. You surprise me. My doubt is absolutely correct, these people have surely done 
something or else how can my son change
 like this? I don’t want to argue with you. I am just saying that you will have 
to take care of Areej. Salman, son, try and understand. I cannot take care of such a small
child in this age. I get tired. You are right. How can you take care of her? You don’t have experience. What do you mean? You gave someone else your child 
to take care of, then where will you get experience
from? Huh? You are misbehaving with me. I am not misbehaving with you. I am just telling you that you will 
have to take care of Areej. I have to go to the office, I have to take care of the 
responsibilities there. If I didn’t have to go, I would have 
taken care of her. You can at least take up 
this responsibility, she is your granddaughter. Child, both your mothers think that we should get Areej 
through police. What do you think? You were saying that you are 
thinking of something. Yes, child, I am thinking, but Naseema and sister Mehreen 
says we should file a case. I just want my Areej back. Can I ask you something, child? Go ahead. Whatever Salman did with you 
and your mother, after that, do you want to live 
with Salman? Child, I don’t understand 
the meaning of your silence. I don’t know if it is a yes or a no. I want to make my last attempt. Maybe I can change Salman’s heart. Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t go through the police station. I will try my best to save my home. Even after so much happened? Only for the sake of my daughter. I think the same. You have reduced the burden 
on my heart by saying this. Pray to God, He will make a way. What sort of sorrow 
do we have, mama? That your husband’s home is the 
same as my husband’s home. That is not Salman’s home. Right now, he is living there. Very soon, everything will be fine. Impossible. When I can find you 
in twenty five years, if this possible, then anything is possible. I can understand your sorrow. I have stayed in that home 
for some time, but you have spent a lot 
of time there, you got married and came 
to that home, You have seen a lot in that home. I never wanted that 
you leave that home. But, I gave up in front of 
your insistence. I got scared. I was fearful. I had to do all this because of
you and Areej. I am really sorry, man. I don’t know what happens to me, and then everything gets ruined. This is my fault. I admit it. Right now, I want to live here with my parents. But why? I have to search for my parents. Going to that home, 
I get lost in myself, then how will I be able 
to find anyone else? So, I will help you find them. I am with you. Where are you coming from, son? When a person comes home, you ask how they are. You don’t start questioning them. You have come really late, that’s only why I am asking. I am not a school going child, that I go on time and 
come back on time. I am a businessman, people know me as Salman. No one knows me as your son.
