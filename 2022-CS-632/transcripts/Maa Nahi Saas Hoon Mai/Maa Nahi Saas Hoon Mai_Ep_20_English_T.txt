[22.04] Where can it go?
[37.80] Where can the things go?
[40.80] Oh.
[48.44] Aunty.
[54.80] I wanted to talk to you about 
something.
[64.40] You do what you think for Salman.
[73.64] Yes, I know that.
[79.44] Why are you telling this to me?
[82.76] Because Salman’s life is not
 just connected with you,
[85.88] it is also connected with me.
[89.52] So fine, let it be connected.
[95.92] If you had a daughter
[98.92] and she couldn’t be a mother,
[103.28] then would you also have 
gotten her divorced.
[106.88] Firstly, I don’t have a daughter,
[113.76] and secondly, who told you that 
you are getting a divorce?
[123.52] So, what do I take the meaning 
of the decision you have made?
[129.04] Look Arooj,
[131.92] it is Salman’s right to 
get married again
[137.12] and especially when you cannot
 give him a child.
[144.44] So,
[147.80] have you made your decision
[153.04] that you will get Salman 
married again?
[157.08] Yes.
[158.56] Absolutely.
[162.68] And what is the harm in this?
[165.32] What is wrong in this?
[172.68] You think that there is nothing wrong
 in all that you are going to do?
[180.20] Yes, I feel that way
[182.68] and my decision cannot be 
wrong either.
[188.80] Fine,
[191.12] then you also hear my decision too.
[196.44] I can never share Salman 
with some other girl.
[202.56] Oh wow,
[204.92] who gave you the option to 
make this decision?
[210.24] You cannot make any decision,
[212.88] neither can you give your opinion.
[217.72] You are only in a position to accept it,
[221.60] and that’s it.
[235.12] I don’t know where it went! 
Why can I not find it?
[284.96] What is the need to adopt a child,
[287.56] what is the problem?
[290.36] The problem is in Arooj, not you.
[297.32] That is why I have decided,
[301.88] that you will get married again.
[311.56] Look Arooj,
[314.68] it is Salman’s right to get married 
again and especially
[320.28] when you cannot give him a child.
[352.64] There are certain courts 
in the world, Arooj,
[359.84] where there is no room 
to make an appeal.
[366.64] What appeal are you talking about?
[371.16] I know all about you going around 
outside aunt Mehreen’s room.
[377.88] Stay in your limit, Alizeh.
[382.68] You are Salman’s friend, 
that is why I respect you.
[388.88] This is a matter between me 
and my mother-in-law.
[391.72] None of your business, okay?
[393.76] You are right.
[397.96] But when things leave the room,
[403.84] then you cannot say none 
of your business.
[411.00] You are the guest of this home.
[416.32] It would be better that you consider 
yourself a guest, only.
[430.56] Arooj you will find out soon, who is 
the guest and who will live permanently.
[443.60] Guest.
[456.60] I heard everything you said, Arooj.
[460.84] Nothing to worry about.
[466.08] How is that?
[468.48] Look Arooj, Salman is not a child,
[471.60] who will be married forcefully.
[477.36] And after all, Salman is only thinking 
about you.
[485.76] But I am scared of aunt’s stubbornness.
[492.68] Hey leave it,
[494.08] God knows if he will get married or not.
[496.96] But tell me, has aunty chosen 
a girl for Salman?
[500.36] Do you know?
[504.72] I don’t know.
[506.44] But I know.
[510.64] What do you know?
[512.44] Who is she? Tell me.
[514.48] You remember I had mentioned 
that girl, Alizeh.
[517.84] Yes.
[523.48] Oh, meaning…
[526.04] meaning you mean aunty is thinking 
about Alizeh.
[530.68] It is possible my guess is wrong,
[532.76] but I feel this way.
[540.56] But, what does Alizeh have? 
How can you say that?
[550.36] Arooj, I have always noticed, 
she tries to degrade you.
[553.84] Why?
[574.72] I will fix this Mehreen’s madness 
in two minutes.
[579.16] What is wrong?
[580.68] She has made everyone’s life hell.
[586.80] What is this madness
[588.44] that she will make sure 
she does what she likes?
[593.16] So, what is new in this? 
She always does this.
[596.04] No, Idrees,
[597.56] we are dying worrying for her life 
and she is becoming death for us.
[603.56] Why are you getting so hyper?
[605.40] This has been happening for twenty years.
[607.12] Yes, we were tolerating it for twenty years,
 because it was limited to us.
[612.64] Now it has come on my son and 
daughter-in-law, I will not tolerate it.
[616.52] Shaista. Shaista. Shaista. 
You are angry right now.
[620.20] Be strong and have patience.
[622.28] I cannot be strong.
[624.60] You do something or 
I will do something.
[628.84] Okay, fine. I will talk to Salman,
[631.04] but you don’t argue with
 Mehreen at all. Okay?
[635.48] Okay. Bye.
[673.44] I am disappointed Shanzay.
[678.44] One medical report has taken me out 
of the list of people who can become a mother.
[682.36] what is wrong with you, Arooj?
[684.16] This is not as ordinary as you think.
[688.72] I know.
[691.16] I know it is nothing ordinary, 
it is important.
[696.12] Then
[699.08] I also think that it is possible 
the report is wrong.
[703.64] They could have made a mistake.
[707.80] This is also a possibility.
[709.48] Yes, that is also possible.
[711.48] But it is not necessary that
[713.44] you trust one single lab test and 
you get disappointed in it.
[719.76] That is why I have asked mama to 
take an appointment from her gynaecologist.
[724.40] We will get your checkup done
from there.
[731.12] Yes, but I will have to ask Salman
 for that.
[735.28] Hey, what is the need to tell Salman?
[738.64] We will go quietly.
[743.08] If the report is like earlier, 
then we will sit quietly.
[747.24] If not, then we will tell everyone.
[754.20] Yes,
[756.40] you are right.
[759.64] Okay fine, I will bring my bag,
[763.76] you have your tea. 
Fine.
[782.36] Arooj.
[786.24] Where are you two going?
[791.68] I am asking you something.
[797.28] Aunty, I was taking Arooj to 
my mama’s doctor, for a checkup.
[803.64] What?
[805.72] With whose permission?
[813.24] And Arooj,
[814.68] you won’t even inform me before 
going somewhere.
[819.92] We were coming to inform you.
[823.84] There is no need.
[828.28] Why do you want to make a joke 
out of this home again and again?
[831.44] If you have got the reports once,
[833.68] then why do you want to get 
the test done again and again.
[839.84] But aunty, there is no problem 
in taking a second opinion.
[843.80] Shanzay,
[845.68] you are Arooj’s friend and that is fine,
[852.80] but don’t interfere in the matters
 of this home.
[868.60] My friend doesn’t have permission 
to interfere in my matters,
[879.16] and Salman’s friend has full right 
to interfere in our lives.
[889.96] Fine.
[894.08] You leave, Shanzay.
[899.96] We are not going anywhere.
[920.72] Drama.
[931.80] Mehreen has made a weird decision.
[935.12] Will you do what she says?
[939.88] Not at all.
[944.04] I will not do this at all.
[946.88] But she will make you agree to it.
[950.56] Tell me,
[952.40] what is Arooj’s fault that 
I punish her like this?
[956.92] I know that as well, but I also know 
Mehreen’s stubbornness.
[961.40] So, will we do whatever mama says?
[965.36] I am really worried in this,
[968.80] you do something.
[971.44] That’s what I am asking you uncle.
[974.68] What do I do? Advise me.
[1007.60] Tell me, has aunty chosen 
a girl for Salman?
[1011.12] Do you know?
[1015.40] I don’t know.
[1017.08] But I know.
[1021.36] What do you know?
[1023.08] Who is she? Tell me.
[1024.96] You remember I had mentioned 
that girl, Alizeh.
[1037.56] It is possible my guess is wrong,
[1039.84] but that’s what I feel.
[1048.20] Arooj, I have always noticed, 
she tries to degrade you.
[1052.00] Why?
[1056.00] Alizeh is making moves against me, 
openly, without any fear.
[1064.48] What is the reason for 
this confidence of her?
[1070.96] Who gave her this confidence
[1075.80] that she has become completely 
fearless?
[1089.40] There are certain courts 
in the world, Arooj,
[1094.36] where there is no room
to make an appeal.
[1100.80] What appeal are you talking about?
[1105.40] I know all about you going around 
outside aunt Mehreen’s room.
[1131.44] When it is difficult to display 
yourself as great,
[1136.28] then people degrade those
in front of themselves
[1142.12] and try to increase their height.
[1146.88] Such people fall on their face.
[1211.96] Wasai, all the arrangement 
should be proper.
[1216.32] Yes, madam.
[1218.16] And no one will say a word more,
[1222.24] or hear a word more than 
I have told you.
[1225.64] Make all the servants understand 
that if there is any mistake,
[1230.00] then I will fire them on the spot.
[1232.92] Yes, as you order, madam.
[1236.00] Leave. 
Okay.
[1256.28] Wasai.
[1257.76] Yes, madam.
[1259.92] Are some guests coming over? 
Do we have a party?
[1262.80] Yes, elder madam’s guests 
are coming over.
[1265.24] So really affluent family.
[1267.68] The party is for their daughter 
and younger master.
[1274.24] This means, Mehreen will do 
what she wants and thinks.
[1280.72] Fine, you leave.
[1282.12] Okay.
[1312.16] No, no, remain seated.
[1313.96] In fact, sit comfortably over here.
[1316.20] Because you cannot do anything.
[1318.72] What do I do, aunt?
[1321.28] Why are you getting angry with me?
[1323.16] Then who should I get angry with?
Huh?
[1327.32] Why are you so passive?
[1331.60] You sit quietly like a sculpture 
made of sand,
[1334.84] and all the matters of the home come 
and hit you.
[1339.76] what do I say aunt? 
I don’t understand anything.
[1343.00] They are preparing for your husband’s 
second marriage outside.
[1347.12] The girl’s family is coming for a party.
[1352.84] The same style again.
[1355.08] What do I do, aunt?
[1358.04] Everything happened so hastily.
[1360.28] We just spoke yesterday and today…
[1362.32] what can I do?
[1363.76] That’s how Mehreen is.
[1365.96] This is her biggest issue.
[1368.80] If she thinks of something,
[1370.64] she does it mercilessly.
[1379.32] I cannot do anything.
[1382.92] For me, there is no one 
who will speak for me.
[1387.84] Even Salman tried a lot, but…
[1390.16] I know Salman
[1392.84] and it is not easy to stand 
in front of Mehreen.
[1396.56] She takes full advantage of her illness.
[1400.04] And we are left staring, 
we cannot do anything.
[1405.92] But that’s it. Not anymore.
[1409.72] I will talk for you.
[1412.60] Come with me.
[1416.56] Come on.
[1420.60] Come with me.
[1436.76] Okay.
[1439.52] So Wasai spread the news 
in the entire home.
[1442.88] Anyway, I don’t care.
[1446.36] Why?
[1447.84] Had Wasai not told us,
[1449.88] would we not have found out.
[1452.36] Anyway, Arooj, you tell me.
[1454.72] Don’t talk to Arooj, talk to me.
[1459.00] Yes, sister-in-law. You go ahead.
[1461.28] Say whatever you want,
[1463.44] but I will not step back.
[1470.72] Mehreen, how can you do this?
[1473.56] The same way the mothers of 
other boys do it.
[1479.88] Other boys also have wives.
[1486.32] Are they not someone’s daughters?
[1489.72] This is something the mothers of 
those daughters should think.
[1496.32] You tell me something.
[1498.52] What will you tell people about Arooj 
in this drama of proposals.
[1503.12] I will take care of all that myself.
[1511.96] I will go to mama’s home.
[1516.24] So that you have no difficulty.
[1518.28] Don’t you dare step foot 
out of this home.
[1525.76] If you step out once, then 
you will never come back.
[1534.16] Do you people want to say something 
else, or that’s it?
[1539.72] Come on.
[1559.36] You people have tea. 
Sure. Sure.
[1564.40] Salman has a lot of respect in 
the Canadian business community
[1569.52] and I have met him once over there.
[1573.92] My son is a successful businessman
and person.
[1578.68] Whoever meets him once, 
never forgets him.
[1581.88] We have heard enough praises 
of Salman, now let us meet him.
[1585.24] He must be on his way from the office.
[1588.40] Sure.
[1593.64] Okay, you didn’t introduce her, 
who is she?
[1602.92] Err…this is Arooj.
[1606.04] My…
[1607.76] there, Salman is here too.
[1611.48] Greetings.
[1612.36] Greetings.
[1616.80] Meet them.
[1618.60] Mom, who are these people?
[1623.08] We had met once in 
the Canadian seminar.
[1628.84] Yes, yes,
[1630.76] I often meet people in 
the business seminar.
[1633.48] How are you? 
Are you fine?
[1636.12] Mom, what are these people
doing here?
[1639.08] Salman, I…
[1640.80] I had told you, Salman. 
Mom, please.
[1644.64] Not again.
[1653.80] Have you been introduced to her?
[1659.52] I was about to introduce her. 
Mom, you leave it.
[1665.76] I will introduce her.
[1673.36] Meet her,
[1676.08] she is Arooj.
[1679.20] My wife.
[1690.28] I think after this introduction, 
there is no room for anything else.
[1698.24] What you people came here 
for cannot be fulfilled.
[1714.92] If you want, 
you can have tea and go.
[1723.56] Let’s go.
[1748.44] Wasai,
[1750.60] what are you staring at? 
Remove these things.
[1791.40] What were you doing there?
[1795.76] I am asking you something, 
what were you doing there?
[1803.12] Alizeh and aunty said that…
[1809.32] What did they want?
[1813.72] And why were you sitting there?
[1817.04] What do you mean 
what they wanted?
[1820.96] What do I tell you?
[1824.64] Arooj,
[1826.56] they were fixing your husband’s wedding,
[1829.08] and you were sitting there quietly?
[1835.80] Why are you scolding me, Salman?
[1843.36] Aunty said that sit here, don’t leave.
[1846.64] So, I sat.
[1849.60] and Alizeh?
[1852.04] Why is she so active in this entire matter?
[1862.76] I have no idea.
[1867.24] Maybe…
[1869.48] What, maybe?
[1874.32] Tell me the complete thing.
[1881.28] Maybe,
[1889.32] Alizeh advised aunty about 
your second marriage.
[1899.00] I will talk to her.
[1900.40] wait, Salman.
[1905.60] I said, maybe.
[1913.12] And maybe I can also be wrong.
[1967.04] I had set the entire matter.
[1974.60] But here, aunty turned the tables.
[1983.88] Maybe nothing that 
I had thought of will happen.
[1992.88] I think I have to do something now.
[1996.52] I will have to do something.
[2030.16] Aunty.
[2036.76] Aunty, I know the way Salman behaved
 with you in front of everyone,
[2042.28] your heart is really hurt because of it, 
I know this.
[2050.88] My Salman, was never like this.
[2057.48] The way I wanted, as I thought,
[2062.40] Salman always considered it holy.
[2067.68] I know aunty.
[2073.56] Actually,
[2075.48] I am the one who knows this relation
of yours well.
[2080.88] If you know,
[2083.68] then how did my Salman 
forget all this?
[2087.80] Aunty, because he has been 
made to forget it.
[2096.20] There.
[2098.08] Look at that picture.
[2102.60] See that picture.
[2108.16] Seeing this picture,
[2111.44] it is not difficult to understand that 
you are two bodies and one life.
[2120.52] Then how did someone do something 
so difficult, so easily?
[2136.40] Aunty, I…
[2142.80] I won’t take Arooj’s name, but…
[2159.44] Aunty, listen to me.
[2171.36] You two look so good together, right?
[2184.84] Aunty, whatever decision you have made 
for Salman till today is really good,
[2198.68] but can I give you an advice?
[2204.60] Look, I know you are looking for a girl 
to get Salman married again.
[2214.96] But this time, please, bring a girl 
after thinking hard. Please, aunty.
[2222.60] Don’t bring anyone like Arooj,
[2225.44] who distances you two from each other,
 completely.
[2232.80] Bring such a girl,
[2235.40] who stays happy with you, 
she makes you a family.
[2240.28] She doesn’t separate you.
[2244.60] Okay?
[2248.40] Please, think about it.
