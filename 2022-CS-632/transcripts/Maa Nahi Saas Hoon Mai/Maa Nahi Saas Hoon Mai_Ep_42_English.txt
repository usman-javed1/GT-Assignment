What would you say after looking 
at all this that has happened. Have patience, Salman, it wouldn’t be talked the way 
you are doing it. Aunt, you are taking this situation 
very lightly. Yes, that is what we have to do. But you said the same to me before to behave softly with Arooj. But you didn’t behave softly with her. look, I tried a lot, I tried to make her understand 
but it was of no use, now you tell me what should I do? Whatever had happened, forget all that and move forward. I should forget it? She is meeting Ammad there and 
you are asking me to forget it, what are you even saying? You heard it right, 
that is what I am saying. Fine, but you are not accepting the truth. I am sure you must be telling the truth, but I don’t doubt Arooj’s truth. Even after looking at the picture? 
Yes. Arooj has not denied the truth of the picture,
she said it is her picture, did you see her confidence? That is why I am completely sure Arooj cannot do anything wrong. Salman, don’t worry, I will talk to Arooj, 
I will talk to her to the point. Just control your anger, please. I will go crazy. I don’t understand anything. When things got so complicated then how come Arooj gave you a new job? Which job? And what kind of job? This, to find the finance leakage. Hunh, that’s a not a job, it is a consultation, and whenever Arooj will need me, 
I will help her. But why have you guys kept this job 
such confidential and secret? Look, everything linked with leakage
is a secret. Don’t you think anything happening 
without bringing it in the CEO’s knowledge and that too for someone 
who CEO dislikes? I don’t know that, I have to fulfill my friendship and 
job with full honesty and that’s it. Okay Mr. consultation but 
precautions are important until you get the results, 
do you understand? Yes, I do understand, I also know that Salman doesn’t like me
 that is why I left the company but whatever I am doing right now
is for company’s benefit. Look, Ammad, I completely 
trust your loyalty. Thank you. But I am just scared that brother Salman
might take this negatively. Look Shanzey, I completely believe that to prove 
the truth, it is enough that it is the truth and we don’t need any support 
to prove the truth. Have coffee. Yes. Mmm, it is good. Salman, you are asking me 
for clarification, but I am helpless I cannot tell you anything 
before the right time, I can’t take you in confidence, I cannot tell you how important it is 
for Ammad to be by my side for my victory. I also know that if I am unable 
to prove anything I will be standing at the same place where you will kick me out of your life, and I won’t be able to bear that, I love you. I just need your trust, Salman. Wasai? Wasai? Yes, madam I am here. Where is Arooj? 
She is not even in her room. Madam, Madam is outside in the lawn. Shall I call her if you want? No, no I will go to her myself. What happened, my child? Why are you sitting here like this? Just like that, I wanted to breath in fresh air. Look my child I know 
you are a very good girl, but even good people can 
make mistakes. Whatever you want to say, 
say it clearly, I am ready to listen. Arooj, you know Salman doesn’t 
like you meeting Ammad, so why do you meet him? Why shouldn’t I meet him? I don’t have any negative 
intentions, Aunt. You are right but my child, that’s not how 
you can spend your life. I don’t even want to spend 
my live like this, Aunt, I want to live my life. How will you stay happy or live when your life partner 
is not happy? Just wait and watch, 
nothing like that will happen. When Salman finds out everything, he will regret it that how can he even think 
like that about me. my child, whatever you are thinking, just take Salman in confidence
 before the result. Why don’t you tell Salman everything? I guess it’s not the time to tell 
all that to Salman, but I will tell him, I will tell him everything, 
trust me, Aunt. I blindly trust you. Then don’t worry, I will never break this trust of yours. I know. Hello? How are you, Salman? I am not okay. I was really worried for you. I mean the kind of workload you have and the situation of your life, you under a lot of stress. Don’t take so much stress. I don’t take stress, I am being given stress. Arooj… Arooj? What Arooj? She tells me that she has a relationship of loyalty
with Ammad. Salman, you want to stretch 
the loyalty factor and take it there where you get the answer 
that you need. Dude, don’t talk about irrelevant stuff
and confuse me. Loyalty is the first condition of love 
and I cannot ignore this. Salman, with this mindset, you cannot get a solution. So then what will you say about it? That she stands with a lot of confidence
to answer my questions. What should I think of it? Salman, you answered 
my question yourself. Whoever is telling the truth, 
this is the kind of confidence they have, and the one who lies only tries 
to avoid eye contact. Bye. What has happened? What happened Nawaz that 
you coming in running like this. Boss there has been a problem. tell me, whenever you come, 
you come with bad news. Boss, this is the biggest problem 
with stealing, you have a fear of getting caught. What stealing? 
Did you steal something? I? No, Boss, we did. The commission that we got 
from Croma advertising, whose cheques Sir Salman 
signed back-to-back. So? What’s new in this? 
I know that already. What has happened now? Madam Arooj has contacted them,
the accountant just called. What? She even got there? Boss, she gets everywhere, she has asked the accountant to give
the statement in front of Mr. Salman. What statement? That you have done a huge corruption
in the commission. So, then what did the account 
of Croma Advertising say? Boss, he will lose his job, he is 
giving them a run around for now but till when?
 The thief gets caught. Shut up, Nawaz. Why are you always talking rubbish? I have to do something about Arooj, she has given me so much trouble. Boss, even Ammad is involved 
in causing this trouble, he is the one who took out 
all the information. Okay you go away from here for now 
and let me think, go. Okay boss. What happened, brother Idrees? Greetings, Sir. I have never seen you so angry ever? Wasai, get tea for brother Idrees and 
something to eat too. Okay Madam. Shall I send Madam if you want? Let Shaista be and do as much as 
you are told to. Go. Okay. is everything okay, brother Idrees? 
Sit down, tell me what happened. Mehreen I am tired, I think Salman has sold all the shame 
he ever had? You are my elder, but I don’t want to hear such things
about Salman. Anyway, tell me what do you want to say? Mehreen, your daughter-in-law Arooj, look at her activities, look. Wasai? Is there some guest? No, no madam, there is no one but thank God you came. Why? Is everything okay? Madam, there is some drama about 
to happen in the lawn. Lawn? Who is in the lawn? Madam, sir is very angry and he even wants to make 
Madam angry. Wasai, what do you mean? Tell me properly, what is it? I am very sure madam, there is some ditch being dug 
for Madam Jr. What the hell? Problems are always created 
for Arooj in this house. Arooj, this Arooj still hasn’t stopped 
meeting this boy? Now you understand? 
Though you didn’t like it when I said Salman has sold
 the shame in him though I even showed 
these pictures to Salman. How, how is that possible? It is not possible, 
it has already happened. If there was any man apart 
from Salman and his wife would be roaming around
 with a guy like this, he should at least get angry 
for the sake of his dignity. Yes, he should. After all, is there anything that 
Arooj doesn’t get in this house? She has a handsome husband 
like Salman and she still roams around 
with her employee? Someone sent me this picture, I don’t know where she roams around
and what does she do? I just said it generally, the girl who is having an affair openly,
why would she care? Enough is enough, If Salman still doesn’t leave this girl,
I would be the worst. what happened to Mehreen? What do I know? 
You know she is always angry, she was just badmouthing Arooj. And I am sure you must have 
supported Mehreen, right? I don’t need to, I just came from office, and Mehreen stopped me here. Mehreen has been continuously 
creating problems for Arooj. I understand the hatred she has for her but how did Idrees get against her? there are only two things that 
create negativity for people, one is greed and secondly fear, even if I accept any one of them so it can be mutual for both Idrees
and Mehreen. The problem is, Idrees is not telling anything openly and Mehreen is not telling either, but Arooj’s confidence is telling me 
that she is on the right path. Mehreen, what are you thinking? Thinking is all what is left, I just keep on thinking day and night. That’s wrong, you should sometimes leave life 
on nature’s flow, you will automatically find the shore. The one’s who goes with the flow 
often gets stuck in whirlpool. Mehreen, don’t you think that sometimes we are looking for truth
 on the wrong place. What difference does it make? We should just do our part, even if we fail, we won’t suffer loss. We will suffer loss, the one we are trying to prove wrong, if they turn out to be true, so who will answer the fingers 
raised on her character? If she is true… I mean, if she is true, she won’t face any loss. yes, Ammad? Tell me what is the news? The same thing that we were completely 
sure about, Uncle has even got stock made from
 that advertising company. What happened? 
Why are you quiet? Like this the first time Mr. Idrees has 
taken money from Salman by betraying him. I am thinking that what does uncle do with all this money? He has such handsome salary and Salman bears all the house expenses. I am so disappointed in uncle, what kind of thinking does he have? You are right. Anyway, if you want, I can make you 
meet that guy. I have asked him to come in front 
of Mr. Salman but he was scared. No, I think I should meet him first then I will tell him that 
I am Salman’s wife I guess then he might 
not get scared and agree to give a statement. Yes, that is possible. Okay, so are you coming? Yes, I am coming, in fact, get a meeting arranged 
with him as well, I will reveal all the corruption of Uncle
 at any cost. I will just be there. okay bye take care. Mom, come sit. What is it mom? Why are you looking at me like this? Is there any problem? Salman, do you know I have raised you with a lot of love
and affection? I had no idea my son would have
to face so much sorrow. What sorrow? I don’t understand. The biggest sorrow a man has 
in his life is having a disloyal wife and Arooj is being disloyal to you. Mom, please don’t say that about Arooj. if I won’t the whole world will, Salman. And I don’t care about Arooj. 
But I do. I care about Arooj. Okay then you may keep on caring, and if you care so much 
then please tell me where is Arooj right now? Salman, I have seen that picture. So that means Uncle… He is the elder in this house 
and he has some rules, there are some demands 
of dignity, Salman and if you don’t mind, 
shall I say something to you? That you have sold your dignity. Salman, my child, what happened? yeah? Are you feeling well? What happened, my child? Come inside. What happened? 
Why aren’t you saying anything? I will get juice for you. Wasai? Yes, madam? Get juice for Mr. Salman. okay. Sit here, now tell me what is it? Salman, tell me? 
I am not getting a good vibe. What happened? Nothing. What will happen to me? Hey are you saying that? 
Are you crying? Son, you are very strong-willed, how are you crying like this? I had someone very close to my heart, I am breaking for her. I know, I know who you are speaking about. I left the whole world and chose her, I went against my mother for her. And what did she do? What did Arooj do? Disloyalty, she has betrayed me. Salman, do you even know 
what you are saying? I know, I have felt everything. Son, have juice and get rid of your anger too. I don’t need it, take it away. Look Salman, son, you should never take yourself to a place where the return is not possible, especially about relationships, I won’t advocate for Arooj today, that girl is very innocent and simple, her character will get dirty 
even if we talk about it. Just give me a few days, I promise you, whatever misunderstandings 
you have in your heart, I will clear them all. Arooj is not the problem, the problem are those glasses that others have put on your eyes, son. Now no matter how clean 
Arooj’s clothes are, you will see them as dirty.
