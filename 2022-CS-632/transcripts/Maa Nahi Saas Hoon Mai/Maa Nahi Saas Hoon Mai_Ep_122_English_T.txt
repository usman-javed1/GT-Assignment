[26.20] you are the wound
[28.36] I want to give to
 Mehreen and Arooj.
[32.40] Areej?
[35.96] Where is Areej?
[37.84] Everyone is my enemy,
[41.84] you guys took 
everything from me,
[48.60] that is why,
[50.68] now you will have to die.
[59.00] Mom,
[59.76] Areej is not in the room.
[61.24] What?
[62.40] Areej?
[63.08] Where would she be?
[64.20] Areej?
[64.88] Wasai?
[67.40] I will throw you and kill you.
[70.56] Areej!
[71.76] Stop, what are you doing?
[72.96] don’t you dare! Stay away,
[73.88] away, away…
[74.68] Shaista?
[75.20] Stay away!
[76.24] Leave her.
[76.76] Stay away, I will throw her down,
[78.72] I will kill her.
[80.36] she is innocent,
[81.24] what has she done to you?
[82.40] Please give her to me.
[84.32] You are right,
[87.04] she is not at fault,
[89.72] it is her mother’s fault,
[93.08] your mother’s fault.
[103.12] All of you have destroyed me,
[105.56] destroyed me,
[107.76] that is why,
[109.56] I am going to kill her.
[110.96] No Shaista!
[111.92] No.
[112.20] I will kill her.
[113.48] No, enough!
[115.44] Don’t take away
 my daughter’s happiness from her,
[117.76] for God’s sake, don’t.
[120.36] Happiness?
[122.72] What happiness are
 you talking about?
[126.00] You are talking about 
the happiness of this cursed girl?
[139.28] I even threw her in 
the trash 20 years ago.
[157.48] Yes,
[158.44] I threw her in the trash.
[187.76] so you were that cruel, sinner, criminal?
[205.28] Who took away a little baby from her...
[207.48] ... mother right after her birth
[210.28] and gave her punishment
 of so many years?
[216.40] Yes,
[218.12] birth reminds me of,
[220.72] Mehreen, do you remember
[222.80] when she was born,
[230.92] you took her in your 
arms instead of Salman,
[239.40] I decided at that time
[242.64] that I would definitely kill her,
[245.04] I wouldn’t leave her alive,
[246.80] that is why I threw her in the trash,
[256.68] but she,
[259.04] she didn’t even die in the trash
[269.40] and she wasn’t even eaten by an animal
[277.16] but instead,
[279.32] this enemy came back in my home.
[291.96] That is why,
[294.40] I will kill her now
[296.52] so you both can understand.
[298.08] No, no, please no. My daughter.
[299.56] Don’t you dare.
[300.16] Shaista? Enough,
[302.96] for God’s sake enough.
[306.04] you did what you had to
[308.68] but you see
[311.28] destiny planned something else,
[317.60] it planned something else.
[321.32] No, no,
[322.80] I haven’t done anything yet,
[325.60] I haven’t enjoyed yet,
[335.56] I will enjoy when Areej…
[339.44] No, no, no…
[339.84] Will be in the floor there.
[341.68] Don’t come forward.
[348.44] Both of you shouldn’t worry,
[351.76] she won’t cry,
[353.64] she will fall straight down
[355.52] and die immediately.
[356.40] Don’t do this.
[357.28] Don’t you dare.
[364.08] Wait, wait, she will leave her,
[366.64] yes, she will leave her,
[368.60] actually the thing is like 
a ghost’s soul is in a parrot,
[372.40] similarly
[373.72] Arooj your soul
[374.96] and Mehreen your soul is in Areej.
[379.36] Stop Shaista.
[382.32] Yes,
[383.32] according to the rules 
I should be doing that,
[384.88] I should tell Shaista,
[386.12] that Shaista,
[390.84] don’t kill Arooj’s daughter,
[392.92] don’t do it, it’s a bad thing, right?
[402.56] But if I should do this, 
why should I do this?
[412.60] I should get at least something too,
[415.12] at least something, 
I am very tired too.
[419.92] Come, daughter Arooj,
[420.76] good girl, my child,
[421.80] sign this file, come,
[423.88] come, sign it.
[427.20] The property will be ours
[428.88] and Areej will be yours, okay?
[430.80] Yeah? Okay?
[437.60] yes,
[439.08] I will do anything to 
save my daughter.
[441.84] I don’t want this property,
[443.60] I will sign it.
[446.08] Yes, that is what I am saying.
[447.32] Okay I will tell you the places.
[448.16] Look, come here.
[452.92] Sign it,
[453.84] sign it, we don’t need anything.
[461.04] A mother shouldn’t think for
 this long to save her daughter’s life,
[464.04] sign it, see its just
 two little signatures,
[466.08] good girl, do it, do it.
[487.96] Leave me,
[489.64] leave me,
[490.44] move back. Move back.
[492.16] I won’t leave you.
[493.20] Come here, 
I won’t leave you.
[497.68] Enough!
[504.04] Enough is enough!
[506.32] You first took away 
my daughter from me
[509.56] and now you 
were trying to take away...
[511.60] ... my daughter’s 
daughter from her,
[513.68] what kind of 
cruel people are you?
[519.04] You guys
[520.44] don’t deserve to be amongst
 the list of human beings,
[525.84] people like you 
who are slaves of money,
[528.64] for whom money is more 
important than people,
[532.60] I feel disgusted living under
 the same roof with them,
[535.08] I feel disgusted.
[536.68] Get out of here!
[538.44] Let’s go.
[539.40] Get out!
[540.08] Shaista, let’s go from here,
[541.64] let’s go, let’s go.
[549.88] Oh God!
[554.36] Arooj. Arooj.
[567.44] My father put all 
the property and ...
[569.72] ...business in my name
 when he was dying.
[571.96] And I will bury this
 truth in the ground.
[574.92] You know this reality
[576.96] but you don’t accept it,
[579.16] don’t worry,
[580.84] I will make you accept
 it very soon too.
[585.76] How can he forgive 
me for conspiracy and honor?
[596.44] I forgive them.
[712.24] Have courage, 
Shaista, have courage.
[716.32] How should I have courage?
[718.80] How?
[723.56] Every plan has failed everytime.
[733.56] Where did I make a mistake?
[737.08] And now they will 
throw me out of this house
[744.40] but Idrees I am telling you
[747.00] I won't leave this house,
[753.00] my grave will be 
made in this house,
[756.00] a very royal grave,
[757.80] beautiful grave, that’s it.
[761.88] Control yourself, Shaista.
[764.72] How should I control myself?
[770.12] Until when should I control myself?
[772.68] How many things should I control?
[777.28] I did so much for this property,
[782.00] for this business, for this house,
[786.60] I have tried so hard kill Arooj,
[795.60] I even put my son 
Salman in Mehreen’s lap
[808.88] and today,
[811.04] I would have killed that
 daughter of Arooj, Areej but
[815.16] But you forgot that Areej
[818.68] is also Salman’s daughter
[828.92] and Salman’s life is in his daughter.
[832.52] I don’t care she is his life.
[841.92] I can cross every limit for this property,
[844.88] for this business so much so that even
[848.36] if you come in between,
[851.00] so you know Shaista very well,
[859.80] I won’t stop.
[874.16] I have wasted so many years 
of my life for this property,
[886.68] and today,
[888.72] that Mehreen and Arooj 
became the owners of it.
[895.24] We have to leave 
this house, Shaista,
[898.56] I guess that is written in our fate.
[903.68] yes,
[908.44] I guess you are right,
[911.00] we are unfortunate,
[919.00] only Mehreen, 
Mehreen’s daughter Arooj,
[923.76] Arooj’s daughter, 
Areej are fortunate,
[926.96] all three of them are so lucky,
[936.76] such a huge accident took place,
[941.08] Waqar died but 
Mehreen didn’t die,
[944.12] she just turned psycho.
[948.92] This Arooj,
[950.84] whom Waqar named Areej,
[954.44] was 2 months old,
[959.68] I threw her in the trash
 by my own hands
[962.48] so the dogs could eat her
[967.68] but look at her luck,
[971.12] she got saved again
[978.20] and the amazing part is that
[979.68] she came in Salman’s
 life after so many years
[986.40] and then in our house,
[989.72] I put my son Salman
[993.12] in Mehreen’s lap 
only by thinking that
[996.16] I will get hold of all this 
property and business,
[1008.24] but no
[1009.56] and now this Areej,
[1011.04] Arooj’s daughter Areej,
[1014.12] even she is not dying,
[1017.92] how lucky are all three of them.
[1020.12] yeah.
[1045.08] Salman, son,
[1047.20] why are you looking at us like this?
[1061.88] When a blind man 
gets eyes after ages,
[1067.76] that’s how they look.
[1080.16] But look carefully,
[1085.76] there is only hatred in
 these eyes for both of you,
[1094.52] nothing else but hatred.
[1098.40] Look, Salman, Son…
[1099.44] Don’t call me your son,
[1109.00] don’t you dare call me your son,
[1116.24] this word doesn’t look 
nice coming from your mouth.
[1129.64] I feel disgusted by both of you.
[1132.80] Salman, son, do you have
 any misunderstanding?
[1137.36] Yeah?
[1138.20] Misunderstanding?
[1141.60] All the misunderstandings
 have been cleared today.
[1151.24] Those parents
[1155.40] who can give their son to someone
 else for the greed of money,
[1161.68] they wouldn’t be called parents
[1167.60] and the mother 
who can try to kill her ...
[1169.60] ...granddaughter just for
 the sake of money,
[1174.16] isn’t even worth being
 called a human being.
[1184.00] Both of you are criminals
[1194.00] and criminals get punished,
[1200.00] and that will be today only.
[1212.28] Salman?
[1213.96] No, son, no, no.
[1217.04] You don’t interfere.
[1219.08] If a mother won’t interfere 
to save her son,
[1226.04] then who else will?
[1233.72] I won’t let my son’s hands
[1236.64] get dirty by the dirty
 blood of these people.
[1247.12] I don’t care about them,
[1248.88] anyone can kill them,
[1252.16] I just care about my son,
[1255.84] I cannot see my son
 turning into a criminal,
[1267.52] I don’t want to lose my son.
[1274.28] Both of you should be ashamed,
[1287.12] you gave such trouble to an affectionate
 person like her for so long?
[1308.20] You tried to kill my daughter,
[1310.04] you tried to kill my wife,
[1324.88] I won’t leave you like this,
[1330.04] you will get punished,
[1336.36] and you will get
 punished at any cost.
[1351.68] Yes Mr. S.P,
[1360.72] Salman Waqar speaking,
[1367.88] yes.
[1401.84] Now our son even got out of hands,
[1407.32] this property, this business,
[1412.28] everything is gone,
[1418.04] everything is gone and now,
[1421.36] guess what?
[1424.12] Now where will the rest of 
our lives be spent in this age?
[1428.60] In the prison,
[1430.20] in the prison.
[1435.04] How funny,
[1443.00] how funny is that?
[1551.92] I am really sorry, Mom,
[1560.24] I did very wrong to you.
[1568.60] I don’t have any 
complaints from you, Salman.
[1572.00] but I am guilty.
[1579.56] I am not a good son.
[1587.76] You are the only good
 one in this whole world.
[1592.08] Don’t cry,
[1593.96] you know
[1596.84] I cannot see tears in your eyes.
[1603.88] I am so desperate 
for motherhood that
[1607.08] I will forgive you 
under all circumstances,
[1611.28] but in reality,
[1613.52] you are Arooj’s culprit,
[1617.36] you have hurt her so much,
[1621.08] if you want to apologize,
[1624.56] go apologize to Arooj.
[1631.60] You are right,
[1636.56] I am her culprit too along with you,
[1642.88] I have done so wrong to you all.
[1648.60] Where is Arooj,
[1649.12] I will go and apologize
 to her myself.
[1705.96] I am your culprit,
[1720.84] won’t you forgive your culprit?
[1742.28] Arooj?
[1745.36] Salman is sorry for his mistakes,
[1753.48] do you see the tears in his eyes,
[1757.36] these are the tears of regret.
[1766.88] How should I trust
 these tears, Mom?
[1774.72] These are the tears of guilt, Arooj
[1778.12] and a mother recognized
 the tears of her son.
[1789.84] If someone of your
 own apologizes,
[1793.36] you shouldn’t take that long,
[1799.04] you should answer
 love with love.
[1805.52] You must also explain 
this philosophy to Salman.
[1817.60] I don’t want to
 understand anything
[1818.88] or explain anything
[1825.08] because you explain to those
[1826.56] you have some
 expectations from,
[1834.76] and I don’t expect 
anything from Salman now.
[1853.76] you are right,
[1861.68] why would you expect 
anything from me?
[1873.40] I am your culprit,
[1879.40] and my mom
[1885.16] and daughter’s.
[1892.96] I have been 
disloyal to 3 generations,
[1897.12] you are right, 
I don’t deserve to be forgiven.
[1899.40] Salman, wait,
[1903.60] Arooj, I admit,
[1906.08] Salman must have 
made a lot of mistakes in life
[1913.56] but he has also 
done good things,
[1921.00] one of those good things is,
[1925.84] falling in love with you.
[1944.64] He is ashamed of his mistakes
[1948.32] but he is still holding onto love.
[1986.28] Mom,
[1990.40] I have paid enough for love.
[2002.44] So are all the debts paid?
[2065.60] I still love you a lot
[2069.24] and I always will.
[2076.04] Forgive me if you can.
[2078.64] Salman, stop.
