[42.76] Salman.
[48.28] Look, I understand,
[51.08] you don’t like whatever 
aunty is doing right now.
[60.84] Alizeh, why are we discussing 
all this right now?
[65.16] Salman, because 
we are friends.
[69.72] Look Alizeh,
[72.00] I need some time.
[74.00] Please leave me alone.
[79.44] Okay,
[82.12] take your time.
[88.32] But can I ask you something?
[92.44] Go ahead.
[97.00] Look, listen to me.
[100.40] If aunty doesn’t agree,
[104.08] you will still have to get married.
[107.96] Salman, then who will you marry?
[112.16] I don’t want to get married.
[115.04] This question is wrong.
[118.72] Did you get the answer 
for your question?
[120.36] Now please leave from here.
[127.88] I am scared seeing the intensity
 of your stubbornness.
[133.00] I swear.
[135.08] What stubbornness?
[141.04] Now, we have to see
[143.28] if you win in this stubbornness 
or your mama?
[152.08] Tell me something,
[154.48] aren’t you taking a little too 
much interest in this situation.
[157.20] Because I am interested in you, 
Salman.
[165.56] Salman, you are my friend,
[169.64] I care about you.
[171.24] That’s the thing or else I don’t care.
[197.08] Wow, aunt Mehreen. Wow.
[204.04] Meaning, I have come here from 
America to buy mangoes, right?
[209.52] I made the entire game,
[213.48] so I will be the one who wins.
[217.76] I have put the thought in 
aunt Mehreen, really well,
[225.92] now I am just waiting
 for the right time.
[233.84] The plane of my plan 
will fly on autopilot,
[237.60] by itself.
[262.52] Look, I know you are looking for 
a girl to get Salman married again.
[273.08] But this time, please,
[275.04] bring a girl after thinking hard.
[276.96] Please, aunty.
[280.84] Don’t bring anyone like Arooj,
[283.52] who distances you two 
from each other, completely.
[290.84] Bring such a girl,
[293.52] who stays happy with you,
[295.92] she makes you a family.
[298.52] She doesn’t separate you.
[318.24] Alizeh is absolutely right.
[322.60] I will get free from the way
[326.04] she is trying to take 
over my Salman
[327.44] in the name of love.
[339.48] The one who comes
 will be the one I chose.
[344.96] She will also give my Salman
 the happiness of a child.
[350.32] Alizeh thinks so well.
[354.72] She is so sincere.
[358.56] Whatever home such girls 
go to they bring life to it.
[371.40] Elder madam,
[373.40] little madam’s mother is here.
[394.04] Sister,
[396.12] I just came to request you that
[399.28] Arooj is a daughter 
I brought up with a lot of love.
[403.28] So, there is nothing new in this.
[406.00] All mothers bring up their
 daughters like this.
[409.52] You are right,
[411.36] this is what I meant.
[416.40] But if Arooj was your 
own daughter,
[421.56] and if her mother-in-law has
 treated her the same at her in-laws’ home…
[426.84] Don’t waste your time in useless 
and imaginary things.
[430.20] Relations aren’t formed
 by ifs and buts.
[434.44] Not just Arooj,
[435.68] I don’t have any daughter.
[439.40] I just have one son, Salman
[442.92] and he is most important for me.
[447.12] What are you doing 
with my daughter?
[451.64] And after all, why are in 
such a hurry for a child?
[455.36] Even delays won’t do anything.
[458.28] The reports say this,
[460.68] so what hurry or what delay?
[462.84] Arooj can never be a mother.
[465.36] So, you tell me,
[466.68] why should I ruin my Salman’s life?
[469.96] No medical science has 
progressed so much,
[475.28] there must be some treatment.
[477.80] Fine,
[478.96] you get the treatment done.
[480.88] Who has stopped you from 
getting the treatment done?
[485.84] But I cannot ruin my 
Salman’s life in all this.
[492.92] Have tea before going.
[550.84] You took so long.
[554.64] There was rush of 
people on the streets.
[557.28] I had told you I would come along, but…
[559.76] It is mothers who can tolerate the 
sorrows of daughters at their in-laws.
[570.72] If fathers go,
[573.96] their heart would explode.
[577.28] Master,
[580.00] daughters face a lot of sorrows.
[582.60] Naseema, is all okay?
[589.64] I wish,
[592.36] Mehreen has a daughter,
[597.88] then she would have known
[599.76] the sorrow of someone’s daughter.
[604.60] What happened? Tell me.
[607.56] They are not divorcing Arooj,
[611.32] but they are getting
 Salman married again.
[615.72] What?
[619.88] This is injustice with my daughter.
[624.56] What is her fault?
[626.72] There is no fault,
[629.64] apart from this,
[631.72] that she is living at her mother-in-law’s
 home and not her mother’s.
[640.16] Now, we are not 
sure how long we will live.
[644.56] We cannot even bring her here.
[648.84] Did you speak to Arooj?
[650.84] What does she want?
[653.04] Yes, even Arooj doesn’t 
agree to coming,
[658.28] and master,
[659.96] she has made a decision that
[662.80] if she leaves that home,
[665.36] then she will not even come live here.
[669.56] Then where will she live?
[701.40] Hey, madam Alizeh,
[703.24] what are you looking for?
[704.68] Tell me,
[705.76] I will give it to you.
[707.40] I was looking for a glass 
for the juice. Where is it?
[712.12] You go to your room,
[714.04] I will bring it.
[716.84] Wasai, I am not asking for myself.
[718.96] I am asking for aunt Mehreen.
[723.40] Okay. You go, I will take it.
[728.08] Wasai,
[730.04] I will give her this glass of juice.
[735.12] Where is the glass? Bring it.
[737.40] Hey, no, no, madam Alizeh,
[739.36] you leave it.
[740.72] This is my work,
[742.52] I will take it.
[745.72] You are a guest, after all.
[747.48] Now I am not a guest.
[753.76] I mean,
[756.76] I have been here for so long.
[759.84] You don’t remain a guest for so long.
[762.20] Go, bring the glass.
[764.72] Yes, I will give it.
[777.40] Here you go
[789.72] What happened?
[791.28] Do you want something else too?
[794.20] Wasai,
[795.80] tray.
[797.16] Won’t you give me a tray?
[798.72] I will bring it.
[808.68] Here you go.
[850.16] Come in.
[857.52] This.
[859.76] What is this, Alizeh? 
What was the need for this?
[862.68] Aunty Mehreen, there is a need.
[865.36] Just look at your face,
[867.32] your face has lost its glow,
[869.64] you have so much 
tension and worries.
[874.52] These worries have 
surrounded me, Alizeh.
[878.24] But not anymore,
[879.84] till I am here, 
you don’t need to worry.
[884.72] You don’t take care of yourself,
[887.16] so now I will take care of you.
[891.36] Alizeh.
[894.84] yes?
[899.08] Stay happy.
[900.72] May you live long.
[904.08] Thank you.
[930.48] Arooj.
[932.60] How are you?
[937.24] I am fine.
[940.12] Are you upset with me?
[946.16] What is my fault?
[951.80] When you don’t know 
what your fault is, then
[956.04] what can I tell you?
[959.52] But hearing you 
talk makes me feel that
[962.84] I have surely committed a crime.
[965.76] I have not setup a court here,
[972.56] and the court I believe in,
[978.12] there no injustice is done, ever.
[1027.00] You tried getting me married again.
[1032.56] But I am telling you,
[1035.56] I will not get married.
[1039.28] I will always reject it like this.
[1045.88] and if the girl is of your 
choice, then?
[1071.24] Alizeh, come to my room.
[1077.48] Okay.
[1082.40] What happened?
[1084.40] You didn’t answer me.
[1088.24] Mom, what are you saying?
[1093.04] The girl I liked, I married her.
[1096.68] For whose sake did you marry Arooj?
[1102.36] For your sake, right?
[1104.48] yes, that’s how it is.
[1105.68] Fine, then,
[1107.60] now you will get 
married for my sake.
[1122.44] You called me?
[1126.16] Yes, Alizeh, come here.
[1135.20] Salman,
[1136.80] I had called you here
[1139.52] so that I could tell you,
[1143.96] I have chosen Alizeh for you.
[1160.60] And I will get you two 
married on this weekend.
[1229.56] Are you upset with me?
[1232.32] What is my fault?
[1237.96] When you don’t know
 what your fault is, then
[1242.12] what can I tell you?
[1245.72] But hearing you talk 
makes me feel that
[1248.84] I have surely committed a crime.
[1266.84] What happened?
[1274.64] I am surprised.
[1277.60] You have asked me a weird 
question, Salman.
[1282.36] You are reacting like you
[1283.76] don’t know what happened 
and what is happening.
[1291.04] Whatever is happening, 
let it happen.
[1294.40] But nothing will happen.
[1297.96] Changing the way of describing 
things doesn’t change the thing.
[1302.88] Arooj, you think I am 
changing the topic?
[1306.64] If you are not changing the topic,
[1308.44] then you are surely 
ignoring it on purpose.
[1312.24] I am not ignoring anything,
[1314.88] there is nothing,
 nothing will happen.
[1317.40] Can’t you see, Salman?
[1319.56] I have become a stranger 
being in my own home.
[1323.68] She makes fun of me 
again and again,
[1325.64] she taunts me
[1326.96] and you are saying 
there is nothing.
[1333.80] Have patience.
[1336.12] I am here.
[1338.24] I will take care of everything.
[1352.32] You know
[1354.64] how much I love you.
[1359.88] And I will not let anyone be
 a hurdle in my love.
[1368.36] I won’t let anything happen.
[1413.60] Salman, wait.
[1424.64] Actually,
[1428.92] I got you this perfume from the US,
[1433.16] and I forgot to tell you this.
[1435.88] Tell me, how is this scent?
[1443.00] Stop it, Alizeh.
[1447.12] Salman.
[1449.56] We are only friends
[1452.28] and we will only remain friends.
[1456.32] Get this in your head.
[1465.80] Salman!
[1484.72] Wasai, what sort of scent is this?
[1488.92] Elder madam,
[1491.24] the bottle of the perfume broke.
[1493.72] It didn’t break, it was broken.
[1498.16] Who broke it?
[1503.08] I got perfume for Salman 
with so much love,
[1506.24] I just came here, and 
made him try it.
[1508.40] I don’t know what he 
got so angry about.
[1512.04] I didn’t even think Salman 
would change so much.
[1514.68] He has changed so 
much towards me.
[1516.96] Relax, Alizeh. Relax.
[1519.68] Salman is doing
 all this to show to Arooj.
[1524.84] You relax, and come to my room.
[1529.48] Wasai, clean this up.
[1532.16] Sure.
[1532.60] Come on, come.
[1568.24] Come in.
[1596.88] Go ahead, Wasai. 
What is the matter?
[1603.56] What happened? 
Why are you standing quietly?
[1606.52] The thing is such.
[1609.48] What is the matter?
[1611.68] Maybe you don’t know anything.
[1617.08] What don’t I know?
[1624.04] Speak up, Wasai.
[1627.08] The thing about little master’s second marriage…
[1638.96] Won’t you ask me, with whom?
[1652.40] Who?
[1654.52] With madam Alizeh.
[1674.16] Shanzay was absolutely right.
[1679.68] This girl came to this home 
with some motive.
[1685.12] Did you say something to me, 
little madam?
[1690.68] Where is Salman?
[1692.20] I don’t know about him.
[1697.72] Fine, you leave.
[1699.32] Sure.
[1724.20] Mehreen, how can you do this?
[1726.76] The same way the
 mothers of others do.
[1733.28] But those boys also
 have wives.
[1739.56] Are they not anyone’s
 daughters?
[1742.96] This is something the mothers
 of those girls should think about.
[1792.52] I didn’t even do anything, but…
[1799.24] but he is doubting me so much?
[1805.68] You know, there is something.
[1808.28] Poor thing is not doubting wrong.
[1816.60] I had not even thought coming
 from the US, that
[1820.28] I will get to see so much adventure 
as soon as I reach here.
[1827.36] But anyway,
[1828.60] if I have found a shelter, then
[1832.68] what is the harm in this? It is good.
[1861.44] Salman.
[1864.92] Why are you so angry?
[1871.72] Mom made her decision
[1874.72] and you are asking me why am I so angry?
[1878.36] Tell me, what is going on?
[1883.28] Salman, what would I know what is going on?
[1887.60] I mean,
[1888.44] how will I have an idea what aunt is liking.
[1894.24] She is not thinking,
[1896.92] she has made a decision.
[1902.76] Salman, how am I responsible for the 
decisions aunt Mehreen takes?
[1908.16] I mean, how would I know
 when she thinks what,
[1910.80] what she doesn’t think.
[1911.92] What she wants to do
[1912.88] or what she doesn’t want to know.
[1913.64] How would I know?
[1916.36] I cannot believe that you 
wouldn’t know.
[1920.28] Why can you not believe it?
[1923.20] Tell me, something,
[1926.24] why did mom leave the entire 
world and select you,
[1929.32] huh?
[1930.48] Salman. Salman.
[1932.64] It can be a coincidence, right?
[1935.32] No. It’s impossible.
[1941.32] First, listen to me.
[1943.80] Nothing is impossible.
[1948.08] And doubting you will
 not get you anything.
[1953.28] I am not doubting you.
[1956.36] I know it well that you 
are after all this.
[1960.92] Really?
[1962.12] Anyway,
[1964.52] I will find out.
[1973.72] But remember one thing,
[1977.08] only what I want will 
happen in this home.
[1995.32] He is doubting me for no reason.
[2000.60] But he is not wrong either.
[2049.32] I have heard something.
[2054.80] Whatever you 
have heard is wrong.
[2061.40] So meaning, what
 I heard is right.
[2066.76] You are saying no with 
so much conviction,
[2069.48] this means, yes.
[2075.12] Meaning your acceptance
 is hiding in your refusal.
[2081.40] I told you.
[2084.32] Whatever you have 
heard is wrong.
[2087.48] Then what is right?
[2088.96] I don’t know.
[2092.36] Really?
[2094.52] Such a big decision is being 
made with regards to you
[2097.32] and you are saying
 you are unaware.
[2099.04] Arooj, I am not unaware.
[2103.68] Neither am I unknowing.
[2106.32] I just have not reached a decision, 
but I promise you,
[2109.20] I will reach a decision soon.
[2110.88] These things you are saying to avoid 
the question are worrying me.
[2114.52] Answer my questions properly.
[2116.36] I don’t have an answer.
[2118.56] I don’t have an answer.
[2126.24] Look,
[2128.12] I am really worried right now,
[2132.44] but I promise you,
[2135.16] I will fix it all.
