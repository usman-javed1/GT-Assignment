[22.84] Did Salman bring you here?
[25.00] Aunty, Salman didn’t bring me,
[26.80] I came here myself.
[28.16] That’s it,
[29.44] are you tired of arguing with me?
[31.76] Or do you still want to argue
 that you came here.
[34.96] You are Salman’s mother, so
[37.16] you are my mother too.
[38.48] Don’t you dare.
[39.72] Don’t you dare call me mother.
[41.32] I am just Salman’s mother.
[42.88] Never forget that.
[64.24] Shall we go home, mama?
[65.68] The doctors have discharged you.
[67.52] The ones because of whom 
this girl argues with me,
[71.28] didn’t come to meet me?
[84.36] It is not like that, mama.
[86.84] Those people wanted to come,
[88.68] I told them not to.
[97.96] Come on.
[101.52] What sort of a man is he?
[104.16] He is one thing in a moment
 and another in the next moment.
[107.24] He changes in an instance.
[126.84] Papa called,
[128.24] he wants to come over.
[129.96] Say no to them.
[132.00] Whatever happened is
 because of them.
[135.04] What do they want to 
prove coming here?
[141.72] Move. Get on the side.
[146.04] Mama. Mama.
[365.48] Send me the file for
 the new project, and
[367.72] update me on tomorrow’s meeting.
[369.20] Right sir.
[370.16] Thank you
[375.44] Good afternoon sir.
[376.64] Good afternoon.
[382.48] Sit. Sit. Sit.
[386.44] Uncle you should have called me.
[388.08] It is the same thing, son.
[391.64] Salman, I didn’t expect this from you.
[393.52] You raised your hand on Urooj.
[398.80] I made a mistake.
[402.64] Making a mistake is not a big deal,
[405.76] the reason that forces you
 to make that mistake is big.
[413.48] She misbehaved with mama.
[418.88] I couldn’t tolerate it.
[422.84] It will take Urooj some time to 
understand our environment,
[426.84] you didn’t good raising 
your hand at her like that.
[435.12] I know.
[437.56] I am embarrassed.
[441.84] In fact, I even apologized to her.
[446.08] Relations are really delicate,
[448.92] they need the same amount of care
[450.92] as a new born child.
[455.16] Even a new born child gets
 scared of loud noises,
[462.20] and then they stay 
scared all their life.
[468.48] Just like that if relations 
get scared, then
[471.20] you have to live your life alone.
[478.04] I am sure you understood 
what I said.
[604.64] Yes, Salman.
[607.00] I think you have still
 not accepted my sorry.
[612.20] Maybe I should have said sorry.
[615.76] Why? Why you?
[618.64] I think I said too much in front of aunt.
[622.48] Yes,
[623.96] you should have said sorry on this.
[630.28] I will surely do it.
[633.00] Okay Urooj,
[635.44] I am really sorry.
[638.96] I shouldn’t have raised 
my hand at you.
[643.52] I am really embarrassed
[646.84] You know, Salman,
[649.80] I had never even thought
 in my dreams,
[652.64] that my husband will 
raise his hand at me
[659.12] and when you came in my life,
[661.64] I got married to you,
[665.20] then I was completely sure that
 this would never happen.
[673.00] But sadly this happened.
[677.80] Anyway,
[679.32] in future, I will try that you don’t 
even get a chance to do this.
[683.12] I will also try.
[686.72] I have some work,
[688.52] I will put down the phone now.
[721.80] Yes?
[723.16] Yes, there is a party at a friend’s 
place in the evening,
[727.16] you be ready, I will pick you.
[733.28] If you are asking me,
[735.24] I will surely come along.
[737.40] Take care.
[767.44] Be careful, okay?
[770.40] Salman.
[775.60] Where are you people going?
[778.24] The two of us?
[779.92] We are going to a party.
[782.44] Are both of you going?
[787.36] Obviously, the two of us will go.
[791.48] Okay.
[792.48] That’s why I was wondering that
[794.72] my son never does anything
 without my permission.
[798.44] Fine, if you are asking me and going,
[801.28] then surely go. Go.
[806.64] Alright, see you.
[808.60] See you.
[809.16] Shall we go?
[875.28] Hey come on, lets join us.
[878.68] No, thank you. You guys carry on.
[880.92] Come on, let’s dance.
[881.88] Thank you.
[882.56] Come on, let’s dance.
[921.92] What are you doing?
[925.12] What am I doing?
[927.76] You are dancing with girls
 that are strangers.
[930.92] Urooj, please. Come on.
[935.24] I dressed up for you on your 
insistence and came with you.
[939.92] Even though you know that I don’t
 like such environment at all.
[943.44] But I came with you, right?
[945.72] Urooj,
[948.28] what is wrong with you?
[951.40] Salman, let’s go home.
[952.80] But how can we leave the 
party and go in between.
[955.44] Let me enjoy.
[957.64] Fine.
[959.52] Urooj.
[965.24] Hey, come on.
[966.36] No, thanks.
[979.84] Urooj.
[986.64] Where are you going 
leaving the party like this?
[990.36] I had come here on 
your insistence,
[993.40] but I don’t like this 
environment at all, Salman.
[996.32] You enjoy the party,
[998.44] I will wait in the car.
[999.68] They are all my friends.
[1003.04] I came to introduce you to them.
[1007.60] Come,
[1009.12] I will introduce you to everyone.
[1021.68] Come on, man. Come.
[1035.16] Silence. Silence.
[1040.76] Ladies and gentlemen,
[1043.08] I would like to introduce
[1044.40] my beautiful wife to all of you.
[1048.88] Urooj Salman.
[1055.76] Thank you. Thank you.
[1058.40] Enjoy the party.
[1063.48] Did you like it?
[1066.52] Huh?
[1067.36] Give me your hand.
[1074.52] Urooj, dance.
[1077.64] Enjoy the party.
[1169.48] I pray to God everything is fine.
[1172.96] Before today, Salman 
has never done this.
[1176.80] He has never gotten this late.
[1198.00] You are finally back?
[1202.68] So late.
[1205.12] What is this? Coming 
so late at night.
[1208.96] You never used to do this.
[1211.24] What has happened to you now?
[1214.64] What are you looking over there for?
[1216.16] I am asking you something, 
answer me.
[1218.88] Mom, you know
[1221.04] I am really busy cause of 
business problems in the office.
[1224.68] If I get late on one 
day due to a party
[1226.96] then what is the issue in this?
[1229.08] Fine, if you have enjoyed 
and come, then
[1232.04] why did Urooj have that face?
[1234.04] Why could I not see that
 happiness on her face?
[1236.00] It felt like
[1237.00] she is in a bad mood because 
of something.
[1239.56] Yes,
[1241.68] she is in a bad mood 
because of something.
[1244.72] I don’t know what it is,
[1247.08] but I do know that
[1249.08] she is having problems 
walking with you,
[1252.60] and the reason for this problem is that
[1254.16] she is different from our class.
[1257.08] Mom, I don’t believe in this class.
[1259.88] My thinking is not like that at all.
[1262.80] Okay now our thinking is different too.
[1267.60] I didn’t mean that.
[1270.68] Anyway, whatever you meant,
[1272.52] I just have one advice.
[1275.20] If you convince your wife who
 gets upset without a reason,
[1278.96] then you will have to 
convince her all your life.
[1281.24] And I want that
[1282.96] my Salman lives his 
life as per his will,
[1288.24] and not as per Urooj’s will.
[1294.64] Go and rest, you must be tired. Go.
[1298.00] Goodnight.
[1298.76] Goodnight.
[1309.24] This is just the beginning.
[1312.44] This had to happen.
[1341.72] What did you do in the party?
[1346.20] I want to know. 
Will you answer me?
[1351.32] If it is something important, 
then I will surely respond.
[1357.04] Meaning, this is not important 
in your eyes?
[1363.28] What?
[1366.88] What was the whole mess 
you created in the party.
[1370.00] You react in one way,
[1372.48] and then you become a different 
person in the next moment?
[1380.88] I don’t understand,
[1384.12] how will I manage with your
 temperament, Salman?
[1389.40] Neither am I so difficult,
[1392.16] nor is my temperament so difficult.
[1397.48] Nothing is difficult Salman,
[1402.76] but maybe I don’t understand
 this lifestyle.
[1409.04] What lifestyle don’t 
you understand?
[1410.68] What are you saying?
[1411.88] What are you saying?
[1414.56] For example, let’s talk 
about this party today.
[1419.80] Urooj,
[1421.12] you are not aware of the 
environment of such parties,
[1423.88] that’s why you didn’t like it.
[1428.80] and I don’t want to be 
aware of it either,
[1432.16] because I don’t like it at all.
[1435.48] Okay fine,
[1437.24] you don’t like it,
[1438.64] so we won’t go to such parties.
[1443.00] Are you happy?
[1447.04] I will go change and come.
[1455.88] I don’t know what type
 of a boy is he?
[1459.88] Sometimes I feel he will 
not agree to anything
[1463.60] and at times he agrees immediately.
[1492.04] What are you doing, Naseema?
[1495.12] Master,
[1497.08] you know,
[1498.76] time has wings.
[1501.04] It flies away.
[1506.88] Do you remember these clothes?
[1509.28] These are the same clothes
[1512.08] in which we found Urooj.
[1516.12] Yes.
[1518.68] Nature had given us a gift,
[1523.88] and then Urooj came
[1526.44] and made our home lively with her 
voice and her innocence.
[1534.76] She grew up so quickly that
[1541.12] she has now gone to her home.
[1547.32] Nature had given us a responsibility.
[1549.80] The way we brought her 
up like daughters,
[1555.64] just like that we sent her 
away like a daughter.
[1561.24] Thank God.
[1565.48] Thank God, for sure.
[1570.20] But she made our home, empty.
[1575.80] Hey, Urooj is the name of goodness.
[1579.80] Nature would have wanted that
[1583.36] now she fills someone else’s
 home with happiness.
[1588.12] Her scent is still there in this home.
[1622.32] Seeing Salman and Urooj,
[1627.04] my heart hurts.
[1629.84] Why?
[1631.24] Is there an issue between them?
[1634.32] Yes, there is an issue.
[1638.48] A very big issue
[1640.24] and the name of that 
issue is Mehreen.
[1644.08] She is standing in between 
Urooj and Salman.
[1648.52] Mehreen’s temperament 
is like that.
[1653.60] Hey, what are you thinking?
[1656.64] No Idrees,
[1660.72] Mehreen’s temperament 
was not like that.
[1666.04] Mehreen changed after 
that scary accident.
[1672.56] Her temperament has become
 like this because of us.
[1676.28] We for no reason gave 
her so much importance
[1679.64] and made her get on our heads.
[1682.36] Or you think yourself?
[1684.52] You are elder to us,
[1687.12] she should be obedient to us.
[1691.12] But here, it is the opposite.
[1693.76] In this home everyone
[1695.20] is obedient to Mehreen.
[1699.60] If the two of us had not done this, 
then today…
[1702.44] I know now you will say that
[1704.48] Mehreen would have died.
[1708.72] Idrees no one dies for anyone.
[1713.20] Caring extra for her,
[1715.88] we have spoiled her.
[1718.16] She is becoming a problem for us.
[1720.76] Why do you forget what 
the doctor said at that time?
[1724.96] I remember it all.
[1727.84] My brother didn’t remain,
[1732.32] Mehreen became a widow
[1734.04] and Mehreen had lost her
 memory in that accident.
[1738.16] Had we not given 
her special attention,
[1740.92] then maybe she 
would have died or
[1742.56] gone mad for the rest of her life.
[1744.44] It was such a big accident.
[1748.08] Waqar and Mehreen had
 named their
[1750.32] daughter Areej with so 
much love and affection,
[1753.96] and she disappeared.
[1760.08] She disappeared in such a way,
[1761.92] that God knows.
[1765.64] How can I forget that Areej?
[1771.56] As soon as she came,
[1773.80] Salman lost his right on all the 
business and properties.
[1787.68] The new born child was being 
made to wear a gold bracelet.
[1797.08] Anyway, I don’t want to 
remember negative things.
[1802.52] Yes, our positivity is 
leaving a good impact.
[1807.64] We are being repaid well.
[1810.00] Everything is owned by Mehreen,
[1811.76] she has all the rights,
[1813.32] my son is with her
[1815.48] and I have to get insulted.
[1823.12] Positivity, hah!
[1843.12] You bring up the daughters
[1847.44] so that someone marries 
them off with respect.
[1850.32] So Salman took her.
[1854.92] Can I tell you something?
[1857.64] Whenever I have a doubt that
[1860.04] Urooj is worried,
[1865.16] my heart shudders.
[1869.16] I know.
[1872.76] You love her even 
more than a mother.
[1876.60] I am Urooj’s mother.
[1881.20] Master,
[1883.72] the love of a mother 
who brings up a child,
[1890.88] is way better than a mother 
who gives birth.
[1896.04] You are a mother,
[1898.08] I cannot compete with you,
[1905.80] but a father’s heart is 
delicate the same way.
[1912.24] I know you.
[1917.24] Your eyes get wet in memories of
 Urooj, when you are sitting alone.
[1998.52] Tell me something,
[2000.04] do you even know about the one 
you want to surprise or not?
[2004.40] You said something so stupid.
[2006.56] Why?
[2007.64] If you tell the one who you want to
 surprise what the surprise is,
[2010.44] then what is the surprise in it?
[2011.72] Hey, yes,
[2012.84] I didn’t think of this.
[2014.48] Man, what can I do? 
I have never loved,
[2016.96] so how would I know 
about these things?
[2018.24] By the way, this is related to 
common sense and not love.
[2021.72] Okay, my philosopher,
[2023.20] you go call your Romeo,
[2024.96] till then I will see something for myself.
[2026.48] Fine.
[2048.92] Hello Salman .
[2050.84] Hey Urooj, how are you?
[2053.12] Yes, I am fine.
[2055.00] Tell me, do you have 
a busy schedule today?
[2060.28] Busy?
[2061.88] Yes, I am really busy tonight.
[2064.72] Where are you busy?
[2066.60] I have meetings.
[2067.84] Important meetings.
[2070.08] Who do you have to meet?
[2072.60] I cannot tell you everything.
[2074.40] Salman,
[2075.60] now you will have to tell me.
[2077.08] Who are you going to meet?
[2079.88] There is a beautiful girl,
[2082.08] she has a great voice.
[2085.20] What did you say?
[2087.36] and where is that girl?
[2090.88] On the other side of the phone,
[2094.52] she is talking to me.
[2096.12] Salman,
[2097.52] you are really bad. I swear.
[2100.44] I will come soon.
[2102.68] Take care of yourself.
[2105.12] Goodbye.
[2106.32] Goodbye.
[2113.04] Did you talk to your Romeo?
[2114.72] Yes, I did.
[2115.80] Shall we go now?
[2116.88] Yes, come on.
[2117.88] See what I got, I will show you.
[2118.92] What did you get?
[2154.32] It is so late, where is Salman?
[2170.04] Yes, Urooj, go ahead.
[2171.84] Salman, where are you?
[2173.56] You took so long to come.
[2175.08] I had told you to come soon today,
[2176.76] but no you took so long.
[2179.00] Okay tell me quickly, 
where are you?
[2181.44] I am just on my way,
[2183.00] I am coming home.
[2185.92] Have you seen the time?
[2188.80] What is the time?
[2190.72] It is over 12 am.
[2193.40] I had an important meeting,
[2195.76] it takes time.
[2197.96] Okay, I don’t know anything.
[2199.32] You come home quickly. 
I am waiting for you.
[2202.64] Okay, I am reaching in a bit.
[2205.04] See you.
[2206.36] Bye.
[2264.44] You are home?
[2265.76] I am here, that is 
why you see me?
[2268.36] What is the matter? 
You were calling me so much.
[2270.72] Is everything fine?
[2271.80] Nothing is fine.
