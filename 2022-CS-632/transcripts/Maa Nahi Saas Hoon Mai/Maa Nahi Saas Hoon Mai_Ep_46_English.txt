Thank your mother for tea. Yes, I will surely.
By the way, you didn’t answer my question. You didn’t hear the answer
you came here for or else I have replied to you. No. There is nothing like that. Come, I will take you outside. I know the way, I will go. When someone becomes quiet instead
of admitting something, then he is at a point, where it is
impossible for them to say no. His silence is his answer. Both Arooj and Ammad have
the same style. No justification for anything. Greetings. Greetings mama. Greetings. Live long, child. How are you feeling now? Thank God. See, I got your favourite biscuits
and medicines. Thank you child. You made me a stranger. Do you hear what mama is saying,
Ammad? She is thanking me. How are you? I am fine. How are you? I am fine. By the way, why did Salman
come here? He was asking me when are you getting married? Seriously? You mean such a big businessman
came to ask you this? Yes, I too was surprised. But don’t you worry, very soon,
this puzzle will be solved. It should too. Okay leave it, I will make coffee, then all of us
will sit together and have it. Okay. Come here, son.
Have a seat. Unluckily, you are my mother in law or else I wanted that
you become my mother. If I had a daughter like you, then I would have choked her
to death myself. Mothers don’t choke their daughters. If the daughter has a character like you, who leaves a husband like Salman
and cared for their old friendships, then you ought to kill them. I have done enough, now it is Salman’s turn. And I know my Salman really well. He has gone after Ammad. You pray Arooj, that Salman doesn’t get his
hands on Ammad. Hey, I was just going to call you. Really? You know I was going to call you
for some reason, but why were you going to call me? I just wanted to tell you that Salman left home really angry. Yes, he was angry. How do you know? Because your Romeo
came to my home. He came to ask me why
I am not getting married. He was acting really childish
in front of me. He is a really innocent and
emotional person, he is not childish at all. But I am surprised
why he came to you. Yes, I found it really weird. If I say that I am going to get married, then maybe his thought can be
removed from his wife. Is that all you talked about or… He didn’t talk about anything else,
asking me after asking me, my choice. Maybe he wanted me to say
your name in response. By the way, Arooj,
can I say something? Mr. Salman really loves you. He loves me? Really? Then he came to you to verify. Because love is distrusting, Arooj. Maybe you are right. Anyway, we will talk later.
Goodbye. Goodbye. What is between you and Arooj? Why did you not ask Arooj this? She would have answered it better. You two were class fellows right? Yes, that’s how it is. and I have heard that you used to like Arooj. You have insulted my love, Salman. Till now I used to think that you have been misguided
by people. But you turned out to be
like that yourself. You don’t trust your wife, and… and you are asking others to testify. And you are making the person
you don’t like testifying. Wow, Salman. Is this what love is? I am sure you are having
a hard time talking to me. No issue. You cannot ignore me like this. You will have to talk. You will come home, right? Brother Idrees, I don’t understand you. Mehreen, what did I do that
you don’t understand. Look, I don’t like beating about the push,
whatever I say will be straightforward. If I say it clearly, then you had started the fire. What are you saying?
What else? You are the one who told me
the stories of Ammad and Arooj. When did I see it with my eyes? And when I asked you to testify
in front of Salman yesterday, then you acted like
you didn’t know anything. So, what did you want?
I would have spoken up? How would you speak up,
brother Idrees? That Arooj shut you up
by doubling your salary. Now don’t be surprised brother Idrees, I know everything. That’s not true, Mehreen, I had told
Salman everything about Arooj. I had told him, that Arooj is…is… Meaning, she is such a good girl,
she understands the matters, in fact, she understands a
few matters in depth. Yes. What are the matters in the depth
of which that Arooj can reach, but I have not reached there till now? Actually, the thing is Mehreen,
if I go back in depth, I will not return. That’s the issue. Excuse me,
I have to do some work. They are weird people. I don’t know what is going on
in this home. You are good at overacting. Put your phone down. Because I know no one is more important
in your life than me. Go ahead, what do you want to say? If love need verification, then it doesn’t remain love. So, see, it is being verified. The sun for the next day hasn’t risen and he has told you everything. You are verifying your contact
with him yourself. This is the biggest flaw of doubt, that it removes blessings from love. I went searching for that blessing. Then? Did you find it? I asked him if he likes Arooj. He didn’t deny it. You tell me yourself, what do I think of this? Stop assuming things yourself. I know him well. He will tell you everything
when the time comes. You know him really well. You never thought of knowing me
like this. You never asked me
about yourself. But I know you really well. That is why you are in my life. Lies, after lies. Lies after lies
and another lie. Arooj. What relation do you and Arooj
have with each other? She is not telling me better, that is why I am asking you. Answer me. Son, Ammad. Yes, mama. Mama, come here. Why did you come?
Son, I was thirsty, so I thought I would have water. Okay, you sit here.
I will bring water. Mama, here you go. Are you fine? Give it to me. Ammad, son, I am seeing that since
your boss went, you have become more worried. I had thought that
your job has resumed. He came to take you. Why are you laughing son? Mama, you are really naïve. He didn’t come to take me. Then? Then why did he come here? Negative thinking. What negative thinking? Mama, leave it. I don’t want to talk about this topic. Child, I am your mother,
won’t you tell me? Mama, he thinks I am really close to his wife. Now, he thinks this. I know son. I know you. Who is his wife? Arooj. The name is good, but where
and when did you meet her? Mama, I know Arooj before
she was Mr. Salman’s wife. Do you remember? I had told you that I had a really
good friend in university. That master’s daughter? Yes, mama. But Mr. Salman thinks something else, he doubts Arooj. Son, doubts can make matters worse. You will have to remove his doubt. Mama, I have tried a lot
to remove his doubt, but I have not been successful. Son, try one more time. This will break your friend’s home. Her life will be ruined, son. Yes, mama, I will try. Fine, then. If you don’t believe anything I say, then it is useless to talk on this topic. Wait. Sit down. I want to talk to you. You don’t want to talk,
you want to ask. Obviously, you question a criminal. Criminal? I am not even accused, and you called me a criminal
without investigation. Wow. Really? Fine, then.
We will investigate. You didn’t like me going there, right? I didn’t like you going there and
talking about that thing. It is surprising. I asked him, he didn’t respond to me. I am asking you,
you are not responding. Because what you say is baseless, there can be no answer for it. And even if you get the answer, then will you recommend the
punishment for it yourself or will I do it? Punishment for me?
And that too, you? You are not in this position. I am talking about the punishment
after you get your answer. The one who mixes doubt with
love should get punished. You don’t talk about love. You don’t even know
the meaning of it. Arooj preference tell you about love. And I can have any number
on your priority list, but not the first. Hmmm. You have the last number. Because when the list is made
on the name of one person, so the first and last number is the same. You didn’t answer me. Mr. Salman, believe me this hot tea is more important
than your question. Drink it. And believe me, Arooj is a good girl. Arooj, child, pass the butter. You are not having breakfast? All okay? Eat something child. I don’t feel like it, aunt. Why? What happened? Why don’t you feel like it?
My heart is not happy. How can your heart be happy, after all, the office is no more. And neither those people
from the office. What do you say, Salman? It doesn’t make a difference
if you don’t respond. It is written clearly on your face. Mehreen, what is wrong? Why are you spoiling the mood
of the children early morning? After all, you have a lot of questions, and you want the answer for those. And if you don’t get the answer for it,
you get in a bad mood. This is not a good thing. What disobedience are you talking
about sister in law? Okay leave it. My issue is that the day doesn’t
start here, but you start. What day and night are you talking
about sister in law? Arooj has made my son’s life dark. You hear it, right? Will you say something or not? Look at that, Salman.
Arooj. She does wrong and act
like nothing is wrong. What has this girl done to my son? Happy now? Punishment for me? And that too, you? You are not in this position. I am talking about the punishment
after you get your answer. The one who mixes doubt with
love should get punished. You don’t talk about love. You don’t even know the meaning of it. Arooj preference tell you about love. And I can have any number
on your priority list, but not the first. Arooj, child, get a grip on yourself. Aunty, I feel my patience and tolerance
is becoming weak. Why child? You have really strong emotions,
and you are a really strong girl? Whatever is being constantly being
poured in Salman’s ears, it scares me, aunt. What fear, child? That what if he takes me
out of his life? Hey, have you gone mad, child? How can he do that?
He can never do that. He is my… he respects me a lot, child. I will not let him do this. With what right will you stop him? He only listens to his mother. That’s the issue, at times he doesn’t even listen
to his mother. He only listens to aunt Mehreen. What will Mehreen lose? She will start the fire and step aside. You and Salman will have to suffer. I feel that only I will have to suffer. This constant friction of aunt Mehreen
has completely removed trust from between us. No child, do you have faith in your love? More than myself.
Then that’s it, don’t worry and I am with you. You don’t need to worry
about Salman either, I will not let him do anything wrong.
