[45.64] Did aunty go to sleep?
[48.96] No.
[51.12] she is crying.
[54.44] She is crying?
[56.68] I will see. 
Stop.
[71.52] There is no need for you 
to go there.
[76.40] Why?
[77.48] Because mama is crying 
because of you.
[79.60] You gave her sorrow.
[82.20] What did I do?
[84.04] I didn’t give her any sorrow.
[85.84] You are absolutely right, 
you didn’t do anything.
[89.48] It is all my fault
[90.96] that I listened to you, and 
I was disobedient to my mother,
[93.44] and I came to get you.
[96.24] So if you had not come, 
how would I have come home?
[98.32] How would I know?
[100.16] I only know that mama is depressed.
[107.60] Now move out of my way,
[109.60] before I get angry further.
[115.32] And yes,
[117.64] in future no need to make 
useless wishes.
[189.96] I am sorry, Urooj.
[193.20] What for?
[196.28] I was in a bad mood last night, 
and I…
[199.00] It is okay.
[203.20] You are getting late,
[204.44] I will ask Wasai to serve breakfast.
[223.52] I will not have breakfast.
[226.20] Why?
[227.88] I am getting late for the office, 
I have to go.
[232.28] Okay, I will get a little late 
in coming from the office.
[234.92] I have some work.
[238.12] Okay.
[246.24] Take care of yourself.
[249.84] You too.
[253.16] See you.
[288.88] Stop it, why are you changing 
all the channels.
[291.68] Hey, one minute.
[294.48] Do you want to watch the match?
[299.76] Hey…
[302.76] come, child. Come. 
Come, have a seat.
[313.36] Did I disturb you two?
[316.28] No child,
[318.32] what are you saying?
[320.12] You are my daughter-in-law…
[323.76] the daughter-in-law of this home. 
This is your home, child.
[327.64] Actually, Salman is not at home, 
he has gone for some work.
[331.72] So I was getting bored,
[333.16] so I thought I would come over
to you people.
[338.88] You did good.
[340.24] Salman took the party that has come
from Singapore for dinner.
[348.52] Dinner reminds me, child,
[350.44] invite your parents her. 
Invite them for dinner.
[354.92] Yes, I will have a good chat with Mr. Shoaib,
 he is a really good man.
[358.84] Absolutely.
[361.16] Okay fine, I will inform papa.
[365.36] But child,
[368.20] Mehreen shouldn’t find out 
about this dinner at all,
[373.24] or else she will do what 
she did on the last dinner.
[375.96] Don’t do that, Shaista, tell her.
[379.04] You be quiet.
[380.76] You don’t know. 
I know how to deal with her.
[387.72] Aunt,
[390.84] think about it.
[393.28] What if,
[395.76] something goes wrong
[399.12] and we have to face worries.
[401.92] Child, nothing will happen and after all,
it is the matter of our home’s respect.
[408.04] Principally, Mehreen should have 
invited your parents,
[413.64] but she didn’t do it, 
so I am doing it.
[416.32] It is their right, child.
[423.40] Anyway, leave these things,
we are having coffee.
[426.72] What will you have, tell me?
[428.56] I will have tea.
[429.84] Wasai, bring tea for little madam.
[467.84] Wasai.
[470.92] Hey, younger madam, you.
[473.36] If you had some work,
you should have called me.
[476.04] What do you want?
[478.92] Wasai, I want to explain something to you.
[482.16] You come here.
[484.72] Yes, younger madam.
[487.12] You know,
[488.88] today my mama and papa are 
coming for dinner.
[491.16] Yes, yes, I know.
[493.64] You don’t worry.
[495.68] I will cook everything well.
[498.48] I know that Wasai,
[500.76] but aunt Mehreen shouldn’t find out 
for whom this food is being made for.
[505.88] But if elder madam asks, 
what will I say to her?
[511.20] So you tell her that 
aunt has asked you,
[513.84] she will take care of the rest.
[517.16] Fine, younger madam,
[519.60] as you order.
[522.12] Wasai, be careful, 
nothing should go wrong.
[524.96] Yes, younger madam, don’t worry.
[528.52] Fine.
[559.64] Wasai,
[561.92] why are you making so much arrangement?
[564.80] Where is everyone?
[566.08] They are all waiting for the guests outside.
[570.68] Guests?
[575.96] Who are the guests, Wasai?
[577.56] That…them…
[610.52] Naseema, please have a seat.
[633.80] Please, start.
[635.60] We are really lucky that 
we found people like you
[639.24] and a son-in-law like Salman.
[647.56] We didn’t have a son,
[651.36] but we found a son in the form 
of our son-in-law.
[657.12] Listen,
[658.92] Salman is only your son-in-law, 
and that is it.
[664.28] Don’t try to consider him your son.
[677.92] Just like the daughter-in-law 
is like a daughter,
[681.24] the same way the son-in-law 
is like a son.
[684.48] You have really weird thinking.
[688.80] I will not tolerate anything like this 
about Salman in future.
[702.60] Salman is only my son,
[705.36] do you people understand?
[729.68] Excuse me.
[761.28] Mom,
[763.04] what is this?
[764.84] Does anyone behave like this 
with guests?
[769.00] You don’t teach me.
[771.28] Those people want to snatch
 you from me
[773.68] and that Urooj is part of this as well.
[775.36] Mom, there is nothing like that.
[778.00] I am your son and I will stay yours,
[780.16] no one can snatch me from you.
[781.40] Salman, you don’t know that 
Urooj’s cunningness.
[784.32] She invited her family without 
informing me.
[787.20] Mom, she had already told me this,
I knew it, already.
[792.04] See. Did you see?
[794.92] That Urooj considers you 
and me separate.
[797.48] They want to create distances 
between us.
[799.36] There is nothing like that.
[802.00] That’s how it is.
[803.96] Okay fine, leave it, 
let’s have dinner.
[807.60] I don’t want to have dinner.
[810.64] You won’t have dinner?
No.
[813.64] Fine, then. Okay. 
I won’t eat either.
[818.88] What is this childish behavior, Salman?
[821.64] You always blackmail me like this.
[827.44] Okay fine, let’s go,
[830.20] we will have dinner.
[832.96] Come on.
[834.92] Come on.
[839.52] Come on.
[889.36] Please start.
[894.76] Uncle, you start.
[901.44] You have it, I will also eat.
[903.92] I will eat, you start, please.
[909.92] Aunty, please start.
[913.32] Urooj, serve food to aunty.
[946.16] There is a limit to everything.
[948.56] Now there is no respect for guests 
in this home even.
[953.32] You are even saying this knowing 
Mehreen’s mental condition.
[958.52] But they didn’t know. They got insulted.
[964.92] Then you tell me, what should be done?
[967.56] Will the insult that Urooj’s parents faced 
be turned back with me telling you?
[978.96] I don’t know what they would think 
about us.
[982.40] Yes, I too am sad about this because
their host was their daughter Urooj,
[986.76] and her parents were degraded 
in front of her.
[990.84] That’s what I am saying to you.
[994.28] We are helpless.
[995.52] If someone can do something 
in this situation, then it is Salman.
[999.28] He will have to act smart,
[1001.44] so that he can carefully take 
both families together.
[1005.92] Salman.
[1009.20] Has Mehreen left Salman capable 
of anything?
[1045.96] Daughters lie and make 
their parents feel good.
[1052.76] Hey, not at all.
[1057.20] Did you not see
[1059.68] how nicely brother Idrees and 
sister-in-law Shaista met us with.
[1068.20] Urooj was telling me that 
they really love her.
[1073.88] The woman my daughter lives with,
[1078.72] she doesn’t love her, right?
[1081.08] Master,
[1083.08] mothers-in-law everywhere, 
are mothers-in-law.
[1087.12] Did you not see? She came back 
in a little while.
[1091.48] Now you will try to convince me
 by saying
[1094.72] that Mehreen is not bad at heart.
[1100.28] She is just upset.
[1103.80] Salman married out of his liking.
[1108.92] May God keep my daughter happy.
[1114.00] I am so helpless.
[1116.04] You think good for every child,
[1119.80] so your daughter will not be 
done wrong to.
[1196.24] Aunty didn’t do right at all.
[1203.24] She had an insulting behavior 
with my parents.
[1209.52] Urooj, she is my mama,
[1212.64] that is why she is so possessive for me.
[1216.04] All parents are possessive 
for their children, Salman.
[1221.48] I know.
[1224.20] But what can I do?
[1226.80] I am her only child.
[1231.16] That is why she is so possessive for me.
[1234.68] The ones who have been insulted
 are my parents.
[1241.36] And just like you are the only child 
of your parents,
[1244.84] just like that, I am the only daughter 
of my parents.
[1248.80] I understand this, 
I completely understand.
[1255.68] Look Urooj,
[1257.88] even aunt hasn’t called me her son
in front of mama,
[1263.40] she minds it.
[1267.24] I am surprised
[1269.20] that what sort of love does 
aunty have for you.
[1276.16] That she cannot tolerate 
your love for anyone else.
[1282.84] This is totally abnormal, Salman.
[1363.72] Whatever happened last night,
[1366.64] after that I have made a decision.
[1373.04] What decision?
[1376.56] In future, Urooj’s family will never 
come to our home.
[1386.24] What do you mean they won’t come 
to our home?
[1390.72] How is this possible?
[1392.04] It can happen the same way I am saying it.
[1399.00] Look mama, they are Urooj’s parents,
[1402.20] they will surely come to meet her.
[1403.92] I told you, they won’t come, 
so they won’t come.
[1409.04] You cannot do this, aunty.
[1411.20] I have not told you to not go,
[1413.64] you surely go.
[1417.36] But hear one more thing,
[1420.16] after today,
[1421.84] Salman too will never go 
to meet your family.
[1430.88] It is so weird,
[1432.36] my son, my son.
[1437.16] How is this possible that 
you are also their daughter,
[1439.64] and my son can also be their son.
[1444.68] Look mama…
That’s it,
[1446.72] I have said what I had to say.
[1499.72] Aunt Mehreen, always keep 
an eye on me,
[1503.16] What I am doing?
 Where I am going?
[1505.52] what am I eating? 
what am I drinking?
[1510.20] Meaning, she spies on you?
[1512.80] Mama, I am Salman’s choice
[1516.72] and aunty really loves Salman.
[1520.16] She loves him like crazy.
[1529.44] Salman is only your son-in-law, 
and that is it.
[1534.96] Don’t try to consider him your son.
[1538.68] Just like the daughter-in-law 
is like a daughter,
[1542.20] the same way the son-in-law 
is like a son.
[1545.24] You have really weird thinking.
[1549.56] I will not tolerate anything like this 
about Salman in future.
[1555.92] Salman is only my son.
[1564.84] Master, tea.
[1575.12] You don’t worry,
[1577.96] God will make it all fine,
[1580.96] because in the eyes of God,
[1584.08] the level of daughters is really high.
[1587.12] He also loves daughters a lot,
[1590.28] so He puts them in a test,
[1592.68] and then Master, it is God
[1596.08] who takes you out of the test. 
You will also see
[1599.24] that our Urooj will come out 
of this test, successful.
[1605.24] I hope so.
[1634.40] Where has my life come to.
[1641.00] There is no one to speak for me.
[1646.44] Not even Salman.
[1652.52] The person who married me out of love,
[1657.56] he doesn’t say anything 
on his mother’s injustice.
[1689.40] God help me.
[1694.84] I have no way to go now.
[1742.12] Where did Urooj go?
[1784.92] Urooj.
[1790.60] Urooj. 
Yes?
[1797.36] Why are you sleeping here?
[1803.48] I don’t know, I slept sitting here.
[1806.40] Come on, get up.
[1807.88] Come upstairs and rest.
[1853.80] Greetings, mama.
[1855.32] Greetings.
[1856.80] How are you? Are you fine? 
Are you okay?
[1859.16] Child, I am fine, 
but your father is not fine.
[1862.76] All okay?
[1863.92] What happened to papa?
[1866.40] He came from school and
 he felt dizzy and fell.
[1869.48] So, did you take him to the doctor?
[1871.60] No, his friend’s son came, 
doctor Faizan.
[1875.08] So what is brother Faiza saying?
[1877.40] Faizan is saying that they will have 
to admit your father for one day.
[1883.32] But your father said no.
[1885.88] He really misses you, 
you please come to meet him.
[1890.72] God be kind.
[1893.24] Okay, don’t worry,
[1895.00] tell papa I am coming to him.
[1899.32] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[1921.88] Aunty, I have to go to my home.
[1927.12] Your home?
[1929.24] I think you are at your home.
[1932.60] I have to go to my papa’s home.
[1935.36] Why?
[1936.68] Suddenly? Like this?
[1938.56] He is not well.
[1940.28] So, he must be at the hospital.
[1943.08] No, he is at home right now.
[1946.00] Okay, so he is not that seriously ill.
[1951.32] He is missing me. 
I have to go to my home.
[1956.04] How will you go?
[1959.12] You send me with the driver.
[1962.20] How can a newlywed bride 
go alone like this?
[1967.36] Then how will I go?
[1971.24] You will not go.
[1973.52] My father is missing me,
I will have to go.
[1977.00] Don’t step out of this home.
[1980.28] Do you understand?
[1985.12] I will go.
[2043.32] Master.
[2044.64] No. 
A little.
[2046.28] I told you there is no need for this.
[2049.08] How is there no need?
[2050.88] Is Dr. Faizan mad that he gave you 
a drip for no reason?
[2054.68] Hey, I am her uncle.
[2057.60] He gave me the drip out of love.
[2060.00] Wow. Wow.
[2061.36] You get a drip out of love too?
[2063.40] I am hearing this for the first time. 
Mama, do you see?
[2067.44] Your father is really careless.
[2070.40] He doesn’t eat food and nor does 
he take care of himself.
[2074.00] Okay, till the time your drip ends, 
I will bring soup for you.
[2077.64] You are here, child,
think I am fine.
[2083.32] Leave the soup.
[2084.72] But you will still have to drink soup.
[2090.68] Mama, you make papa eat the apple
[2093.04] and if he doesn’t eat, then tell me.
[2104.80] Naseema,
[2107.00] now that she has come, 
my heart is at peace.
[2110.76] May God protect my daughter.
[2114.12] Amen.
[2116.40] Come on,
[2117.80] now that your daughter has told you,
you will have to eat the apple.
[2122.20] Yes.
[2137.08] How can a newlywed bride 
go alone like this?
[2142.24] Then how will I go?
[2144.56] You will not go.
[2146.68] My father is missing me, 
I will have to go.
[2150.36] Don’t step out of this home.
[2153.64] Do you understand?
[2167.20] Thank you.
[2175.76] I was about to call you.
[2179.96] Salman, papa is not well.
[2183.12] Where are you?
[2185.24] I came to papa’s place.
[2187.88] Okay, you did good.
[2189.36] Okay tell me, is uncle fine now?
[2191.08] Yes, he is a little better right now,
[2193.12] but he is still getting a drip.
[2195.60] How did you go there?
[2200.00] I came in an auto.
[2201.92] In a rickshaw?
[2203.80] You should have taken the car.
[2205.52] The car was not at home.
[2208.04] I had to come quickly, 
so I took a rickshaw.
[2212.84] Okay, you do one thing,
[2214.32] take lots of care of uncle.
[2218.52] I am getting free from the office 
in a little bit,
[2220.40] I will come and meet uncle 
and I will also pick you.
[2224.72] Okay, goodbye.
[2227.32] Goodbye.
