Leave my son, leave, come Salman. What? What are you saying
 sister-in-law? I am telling the truth. Salman is my son, I gave birth to him. I gave Salman to you, 
just to save your life. Now I want my Salman back, 
right here, right now! How dare you utter 
such nonsense? You did not do the right 
thing Mehreen! I will do this again and again, if you will do this then 
I will do this again and again. How dare you call 
Salman your son? Because Salman is my son! Aunt, please! It is shocking, how can aunt say such a thing? And how can she put such
 a big claim? There must be some truth 
behind all of this, otherwise aunt would have thought
 before speaking so much. And whatever the matter is, I should know about it. Young ma’am, whatever is happening, this is not right. This was bound to happen Wasai. You are right but it was not supposed to 
happen right now, and it wasn’t supposed to 
happen like this. You know about elder madam’s 
mental condition, this is Madam's trick! What kind of trick? Actually, I am very poor and weak, also, I am just the maid 
of this house, I fear before speaking 
about anything. Don’t worry Wasai, no one is here except you and I, you can say whatever 
you want to say. Actually, Madam wants to remove 
elder ma’am from her way. What do you mean? What I meant is, elder ma’am doesn’t have the strength
 to tolerate any big news, then why was she given this news? Hmm, so God forbid she gets shock and… Yes! Now you understood 
what I meant. So Wasai, what shall we do? 
What should be done now? I cannot do anything, now whatever is to be done, it has to be done by you. You have to handle this matter now. Stop it, what are you saying? It is the truth, I am right! You are really my son…
Salman! Salman, tell her to get lost! Brother Idrees take 
this woman away, otherwise no one will be worst 
then me! Go away! No one is worse than you. It is such a weird thing, no one wants to listen 
to the truth. This is the truth! 
This is the truth! Salman is my son, 
I want my son back. Please! Stop your rubbish and 
get lost from here! Go away! Shaista come, come. Come Shaista. 
Leave my hand! Idrees! Telling this truth so suddenly 
in front of everyone, this woman really wants 
to kill my mother. What is this misbehaviour, huh? What way is this to enter 
someone’s bedroom? I can show you the mirror 
without misbehaving, but you don’t want 
to see the mirror because a mirror never lies. What are you trying to say, huh? What you don’t want to hear. You are continuously 
misbehaving with me. And what you have been doing 
for the past 25 years, what about that? But what you have done now, you will not be forgiven for that! What have I done, huh? What have I done? What you have done? You have tried to kill my mother! I have done no such thing, I only claimed my son as mine! If Mehreen dies after hearing this, then I don’t care. Your intention was to hurt her but nothing happened, but now, now I am between you two! Now I won’t let anything like this 
happen either. Now whatever will happen, you wouldn’t have even 
thought about it. I have no interest in listening 
to your rubbish, and by the way, the ridiculous trick that 
you played with my mother, your intention was to hurt us 
completely, but luckily God was on our side. We were fearing that when mom will come to know 
about all of this, she will get such a big shock. But by God’s grace, 
she survived everything! And you know, whatever she will come 
to know now, it will only be a source 
of happiness for her. Happiness? Means she will find happiness
 in the fact that you are her daughter, her daughter has been found. Arooj, you are so innocent. Nowhere in Mehreen’s mind, 
is there even a single doubt that she had a daughter, Yeah! there you go. Salman, where are you going? I am going to aunt. Okay, but why? For clarification, on what basis did she say
 such a thing? If this secret gets uncovered then this shock, will be unbearable 
for both, mom and Salman. Yes, you can ask about 
this some other time. She must have said it just 
in the moment. I already told you that aunt’s behaviour is really 
changed nowadays. No Arooj, there is some truth 
in every rumour, and I, I want to know the truth. Yes, there is some truth, but you can find out when
it’s revealed, in its own time. I still want to know. Can I say something?
Hmm… Mom’s attitude is changing, you have made her busy 
in the right way. Her job is to love, but she has seen such 
hardships in life that hardened her attitude. What kind of hardships? Right now, I left Areej with her, rest will get better on its own. Everything is fine, 
what could get more better? You will get to know 
everything with time. Mom! Hey, back off, why are you stuck to me? 
Move back. Mom
What Mom Mom? No mom
Hey move back, why have you glued yourself to me?
I am asking you to move back, back off, are you mad? Why are you repeatedly 
calling me your mom? I am not your mother. You fool! And you know, whatever she will come 
to know now, it will only be a source of 
happiness for her. Happiness? Means she will find happiness
 in the fact that you are her daughter, her daughter has been found. Arooj, you are so innocent. Nowhere in Mehreen’s mind, 
is there a single doubt that she had a daughter, Yeah! there you go. Mom doesn’t remember, that she once had a daughter. She doesn’t know anything, and if we make her remember it then she will go through a huge 
shock connected with her past, which would turn out to be 
harmful for her. If mother never comes to know, then what will happen? I know that she is my mother, but, but she will never call me 
‘daughter’ and hug me to herself. Yes but, but I can hug her by calling her ‘mom’. Your intention was to hurt her but nothing happened, but now, now I am between you two! Now I won’t let anything 
like this happen either. Now whatever will happen, you wouldn’t have even 
thought about it. I have no interest in listening
 to your rubbish, and by the way, the ridiculous trick that 
you played with my mother, your intention was to hurt us 
completely, but luckily God was on our side. We were fearing that when mom will come to know 
about all of this, she will get such a big shock. But by God’s grace, she survived everything! Salman, son! What’s wrong son? You look worried. Do you want to say something? 
Speak… I don’t understand from where 
shall I start, but I want to ask something 
from you. Ask, I am listening my child. What was the reason behind 
whatever you said to mom? Even though you know how 
possessive Mom is for me, she cannot tolerate such a thing
 even as a joke! And I don’t know why I am saying
 this to you because you are aware of 
Mom’s mental health, then, why did you try to prove this lie
to be a truth in front of her? This is not a lie son, this is the truth. You are not Mehreen’s 
but my son! Mehreen is not your mother, I am your mother. 
Enough! Don’t say anything after this. This is not a film or drama where 
I will agree to whatever you are saying. How shall I make you believe that you are my son, I am your mother. No, I will not believe 
what you are saying, you are lying, 
this is not the truth. Idrees, look, Salman is not believing to the fact 
that we are his parents. Salman is my son, I gave birth to him. I gave Salman to you, just to save your life. Now I want my Salman back, right here, right now! Oh God! Oh God! what kind on voices are these? How can this happen? All of it is lie, all of this is a lie, everyone was wrong, 
it cannot be like this, it can’t be like this. 
Sister Shaista, Sister Shaista was lying, 
she was wrong. How can Salman be her son? No! No! All of it must be a lie. Salman! Salman! Salman! He cannot believe, tell him, I am his mother and 
you are his father, tell him! Uncle, she is lying right, it’s not like that. Uncle answer me, 
this is a lie right? No, tell him Idrees, 
tell him I am not lying. Look son, now that Shaista has uncovered 
the secret, then listen carefully, I am not your uncle, I am your father and Shaista is your mother.
