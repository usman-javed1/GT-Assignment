Mehreen, how is Salman feeling now? He is fine now. He just slept. Okay, you go and sleep. I will sit with Salman. No, not at all. I don’t need anyone’s help 
to take care of my son. This woman’s behaviour is 
becoming intolerable. But what can I do, I am helpless. Mehreen, don’t insist. 
Rest a little. I will take Salman to my room. Even if you ask the same thing 
in a different manner, my answer will not change. It will remain the same. If the cuckoo bird leaves her children 
in a crow’s nest out of helplessness, still those children don’t grow up 
to be crows. Younger madam, why are you lying over here? Go and lie on the bed, there. This way, you will get a pain 
in your neck. It has been so many days, Wasai, that I have not been able to sleep. I was going to sleep, if you want tea or coffee, then let me know. I will make it. If I drink coffee, then I will not be 
able to sleep till morning. Fine, then I will go. Wait, Wasai. Sit, I want to talk to you. Yes? Something has been bothering me 
in my heart for the past few days. What is it? Wasai, do you remember, Salman had an accident. Yes, I remember it well. Even then, aunt Shaista was worried more 
than aunt Mehreen. That’s how it was, right? Yes, that’s absolutely how it was. And now, when Salman got shot, even now, aunt Shaista has 
the same behaviour. Madam really loves little master. Yes, but, Salman is adopted, right? Aunt Mehreen loving Salman is fine,
it is justified, she considers him her son
 unknowingly. But I don’t understand so much love
of aunt Shaista with Salman. There is another big reason for 
madam’s love for little master. Big reason? What is that? It is… Don’t worry, Wasai. Tell me openly, 
what the matter is. Little master is not the son 
of a distant relative. In fact, he is the son of madam 
and elder sir. So, you have found out. It is true, Arooj, child. So, if Salman is not 
aunt Mehreen’s son, then whose son is he? We have a relative, Salman is their son. Are you okay? Something really bad is going 
to happen, Shaista. What happened? Mehreen did what I feared, 
even after I told her not to. What did she do? What happened? Tell me. She has called Salman’s friend, 
who is an SP. The whole police party will be there. They have taken Mehreen, Salman, 
Arooj, everyone’s statement. What are you saying? I am right, madam. But you don’t become emotional. It is a question of elder madam’s life. Yes, but does Salman know this? No, little master doesn’t know anything. Fine, you can leave. Sure. Does Salman know this? He doesn’t and neither does Mehreen. If Mehreen finds out this truth, she will not be able to tolerate 
this mental shock, and if Salman finds out this truth, then her personality will 
get shattered. Meaning… I don’t understand…I mean, the whole family is acting and lying, 
including Wasai. Yes, child and I want that you too support us and stay quiet. You will not tell anyone this truth. Can you do that for me? But still no one is ready to call 
aunt Mehreen wrong. You tried speaking the truth, right? Was Mehreen able to tolerate it? If your relation with relations 
doesn’t remain, it is a heavy truth. Okay, whatever happened, 
happened. Be careful in future, okay? There, that poor Salman is 
also worried. And Arooj, please, 
for God’s sake, you will not reveal this secret
in front of Salman. I will be able to tolerate the suffering
of Mehreen’s pain, but I cannot see Salman suffering. Promise me, 
that you won’t tell anyone. Hmmm. So this is that distant relation, who lives in the same home. Salman turned out to be
 uncle’s son. Meaning, uncle cunningly took 
advantage of mama’s health, mental condition and me 
going missing, and put Salman in her lap. And then he put all the wealth 
in her lap. Uncle turned out to be 
a big planner. Now, I will untangle 
this entangled story. Uncle, the end of your story is not far now. This is not good at all. The circle is getting smaller 
around us and I fear that the police might be able to 
find out everything. If, we get caught, then everyone will find out that 
the bullet was fired on my orders. No. Hey, pick up the phone, 
where the hell are you? Sir is calling. Wait, 
I will come. Go ahead, sir. Hey, where the hell were you? I would have gotten caught,
 I just got saved. What nonsense is this? I called you because the FIR 
has been filed and the police will find you. They will find me? The police raided my home. I ran away saving my life 
with difficulty. Get killed, but don’t get caught.
 Understand? What is wrong, sir? I don’t take your name and 
I give my life. Wow, just wow. Okay fine, get angry. You do one thing, leave the city, 
go somewhere far. How do I leave? I don’t have a single penny 
in my pocket. I need more money sir. Fine. Fine. You will get money. But don’t get caught by the police.
Don’t get caught. Fine. Greetings. Greetings. 
Come, sit here. You should have asked me, 
I am here. Sit comfortably. You are fine, right? I am fine. Thank God. You don’t have to do anything 
with me around. Got it? Yes, yes, son. All of us will take care of you.
All of us. Yes. All of us will take care, but the way Salman’s mother 
can take care of her, no one can pay so much attention
 towards Salman. And I doubt someone can care for 
Salman as much as aunt Mehreen. Right, aunt Shaista? I too was saying the same thing, that all of us should take care 
of Salman. That’s it. Salman shouldn’t worry 
about anything. Absolutely. Salman, I am getting a call 
from your office. Give it to me. There is no need to do the office work 
till you get fine. Do you understand? And you will not step foot out of 
this home without my permission. Mom, I am not going to the office, there were a few documents that I had to send to the office, 
that is why I had to talk on a call. Okay fine, answer it. You don’t know, what a mother’s heart goes through. Phone. Attend the phone. Elder madam, breakfast is served. Everyone, come on. Fine, Wasai, go ahead,
we are coming. Shall we go for breakfast? Come on, get up. Careful. Careful. Where is Salman? He must be in Mehreen’s room. Good. He should be where he can be 
taken care of the most. Meaning? Meaning, you turned to be 
so cunning even when you were not 
paying attention, that you ducked 
in front of the bullet and the bullet hit Salman. I didn’t understand one thing. Aunt Mehreen is worried because she is Salman’s mother. But, why are you so worried on 
Salman getting shot?
