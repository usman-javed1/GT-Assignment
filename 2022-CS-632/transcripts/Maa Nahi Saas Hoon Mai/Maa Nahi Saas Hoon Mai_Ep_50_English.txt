Hey, I couldn’t find one medication, I looked around the
 city and brought it. Now you get well soon. I am fine, master. You tell me, did you tell Arooj anything? She was calling me 
again and again, so out of helplessness 
I told her for her satisfaction. You didn’t do good, she must be worried
 without a reason. What are you thinking now? I am thinking, what else have we given to
 Arooj apart from worries? Why did this thought 
come to your head? You get such thoughts, master. I feel we decided to 
marry Arooj in a haste. And this is our biggest mistake. We made this decision 
for Arooj’s betterment. But maybe, we couldn’t make 
the right decision. We should have investigated 
Salman’s family along with him. Now one thing will 
always pinch me. What? If Arooj was our real daughter, still would we have handed her
 over to such a mother in law? Naseema, you surprise me. What is the reason to worry yourself today
 for the sorrow of the past? And what is the need 
to think this right now? There is a need. I feel we have really done injustice to Arooj, 
knowingly or unknowingly. What injustice? We married her in a home where she is being tortured constantly. Meaning, if Arooj was our own daughter, we wouldn’t have fixed this proposal? Master, if you drop something 
delicate and it breaks, then you feel sorrow. But there is no fear of 
being answerable. Hey, who do we have to answer to and why do we have to answer. We don’t doubt the sincerity of our love. We found Arooj, we kept her close to our heart. We didn’t have a daughter of our own. We gave Arooj all the love. We brought her up. Now Arooj is our daughter. Master, I feel Arooj is here. No, there is no one. The door is closed. Okay, I am getting water for you, quickly have your medication. If Arooj was our real daughter, still would we have handed her 
over to such a mother in law? Meaning, if Arooj was our own daughter, we wouldn’t have fixed
 this proposal? If the wife loves her husband, it is not called trapping him. But when the son forgets 
her mother, only belongs to his wife, then it is called trapping the son. Now how do I respond to
 this question of yours? You have an answer, 
but you will not give it, because you are more
 cunning that I can think. I am surprised. You consider my acumen, 
ingeniousness and my love as cunningness. She had fainted, she just came home
 from the hospital and all this happened 
because of you. Be quiet. Do you know what 
you are saying? I know well what I am saying. you know, I had made an image of 
yours in front of my mother, and you ruined that image. My mother’s patience also broke. She heard everything today. She can hear it if she wants. I am not afraid of your mother. You can at least respect her. She is my mother. Your mother is not unique. My mother is everything for me, and in future, don’t 
say a word for her. The faith of this Arooj is now touching the heights
 of misbehaviour. She now has started to consider
 herself the owner of this home. I will stop her from using 
this fearless tone. She thinks that this 
Mehreen knows nothing. But she doesn’t know that now it is time. I will show her 
my true colours. What is the reason to worry yourself today for 
the sorrow of the past? And what is the need 
to think this right now? There is a need. I feel we have really done injustice to Arooj,
 knowingly or unknowingly. What injustice? We married her in a home where she is being
 tortured constantly. Meaning, if Arooj was our own daughter, we wouldn’t have fixed 
this proposal? Who am I? Arooj? No. This introduction 
is incomplete for me. Whose daughter am I? if they are not my parents, then… then who are my parents? Who will answer these
 questions of mine? Who will I ask? How can I ask the parents who brought
 me up with so much love, who am I? Who am I and who are they? No, I will not ask anyone, nor will I tell anyone. Because there is nothing to ask, nor is there anything to ask. How can you think so 
mercilessly, Mehreen? Do you not feel mercy on Arooj . If she speaks the truth, 
you think it is a lie. If her mother is unwell, you think it is a drama. Is all this fine? Is this the right behaviour? She lies sister in law. How do I believe her? She used her mother’s 
health as an excuse and is sitting at her mother’s home. So what do you think? Even her mother is lying? She is doing a drama
 of being unwell? Yes, it is absolutely possible. Oh my God. Mehreen, how much hatred 
do you have for Arooj in your heart? You didn’t like Arooj from day one, only because she is not yours, but Salman’s choice, right? Such a girl cannot be
 my choice, sister in law. Even if she is Salman’s choice? Salman is inexperienced, he is stupid and I will not let people take 
advantage of these stupidities of his. Salman is my life. I love everything about him. But I don’t love his love, sister in law. But that child loves you, Mehreen. She doesn’t sister in law. It is all a lie. If she loved me, then she would have 
respected me too. If you also find out what 
she said to me, then maybe you too 
will believe me. Really? What did she say? Tell me. Tell me. We will talk about that in front
 of everyone, sister in law. And it will especially be done 
in Salman’s presence. But Salman is not ready to 
accept anything I say as correct 
and as the truth. According to you, Salman only listens to Mehreen. So child why do you worry
 yourself thinking this? Because I cannot separate 
this thought from myself. Why? Aunt Mehreen is pushing 
me in a quicksand. Despite making a lot of attempts, I am getting stuck in that
 quicksand, aunt. What do I do? Aunty, where is Arooj? I don’t see her. Arooj? Arooj didn’t come here. She didn’t come here? But she told me on the phone that she was coming to ask how you are. Son, Salman, did she say that? Then why didn’t she come here? I don’t know. What happened, son? Her phone is off. Greetings. Wasai, where is Arooj? What? For the past two hours? But where? Yes, but she didn’t come here. Okay fine, I will ask. Okay aunty, I will go now. Hey Salman, where is Arooj? I think she went to a friend. Okay. Okay fine. When she comes, do send her to me. Sure, aunty. In fact, I will bring her with me. You are really good. You really care for Arooj. But… But what aunty? She is really happy with you, but she is not happy in that home, son. There is nothing like that aunty, there are ups and downs in every home. You are right. Okay, you take care. I will go. Fine, son. You go. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hey, who do we have to answer to and why do we have to answer. We don’t doubt the sincerity of our love. We found Arooj, we kept her close to our heart. We didn’t have a daughter of our own. We gave Arooj all the love. We brought her up. Now Arooj is our daughter. You have a noise inside you and I have a noise inside me. But there is so much 
difference between the two. You can express your noise 
with full intensity, and me? Hello Arooj. Hey, you surprise me. I have been calling 
you for so long, your phone is off. Okay tell me, where are you? There, at the same place, where I talk to myself, alone. But why did you go there alone? I am alone. Arooj, why do you consider 
yourself alone? I am with you. You know, Salman, at times a person feels alone even 
when they are with everyone. This means there is 
something special. Won’t you tell me? There is nothing to tell you. Okay, you wait, I am coming there. Hey Naseema, the doctor told you to rest, why did you come out? Salman, came over. Salman came? Then why did you leave so early? And he didn’t drop Arooj
 with you either. Arooj didn’t come. What do you mean? Arooj didn’t come? So you should have asked Salman. Even he doesn’t know. Huh? Even he doesn’t know
 where Arooj is? Then where is Arooj? Master, he was worried himself. What are you thinking? Arooj found out about your ailment, still she didn’t come to see you. There must have been
 some issue with Mehreen. That’s it, she would be lying somewhere
 with her mobile switched off. If there was some issue there, she should have come here. If some issue happens 
with daughters, they should come to
 their parents’ home. What can I say? I don’t know what situation 
my daughter would be going through. Okay come on, it is time for your medication, get up. Come. Careful. Arooj. What are you doing here? You didn’t go to meet aunty Naseema, your phone was off and you are standing here alone? I am alone, so I will stand alone. What is the matter, Arooj? Nothing. There is something. Tell me. When there is nothing to tell you, 
then what will I tell? Did mama say something? She often says one thing or the other. What is new in that? But you know, Salman, her saying anything or talking 
about something doesn’t bother me. Then what is the reason that you need to be alone like this? The guesses you are 
making to find out what it is, maybe you won’t be able 
to know it. Because maybe I too just
 found out about this. Look, if there is anything you 
can share it with me. I can hear it. Okay come on, let’s go. Where? To meet your mother.
