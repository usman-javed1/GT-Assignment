[36.68] Arooj, my mobile. 
I won’t give it.
[39.00] Naseema? 
Hey, Naseema?
[40.64] Hey, what happened Master?
[42.60] That mischief took my phone 
and ran away, catch her.
[48.92] Arooj?
[50.32] Arooj, where are you?
[60.28] Arooj,
[61.52] my child come in front of me 
else dad will get upset.
[65.64] Here I am.
[67.16] Arooj, my daughter.
[70.92] Catch this girl. Catch, 
catch, catch, Arooj.
[73.92] Give dad’s phone back.
[75.32] Catch, catch, catch.
[81.92] You mischief. Come here. 
Catch this girl.
[104.24] What is this?
[105.44] This is a clock that is 
put on the wall.
[107.96] Very good and what is this? 
Kite.
[110.44] Kite. How does the kite fly?
[112.64] We make it fly then some other kite
cuts it then it comes back flying to us.
[119.68] Good girl.
[122.08] And what is this?
[123.76] Turtles, they live in water,
[125.96] and if they don’t like something 
they put their face in their shell.
[133.12] Yeah, and what is this?
[136.24] This is a bird that flies in the sky.
[139.92] Very good. 
You are very intelligent.
[207.92] Mom, I am very hungry, 
when will the food get done?
[213.76] yes, Mom’s love,
[215.60] food will be ready in just 5 minutes
[218.56] and Mom has made Arooj’s 
favorite food today,
[223.48] guess what?
[231.52] Noodles Ma..
[243.56] Arooj, my child, 
when did you come?
[253.12] And what are you doing in the kitchen
it’s so hot in here,
[257.76] go, go sit in the room, 
I will be there.
[354.04] How did you even think about it?
[360.56] Arooj,
[362.56] it’s not like you have no one 
at your back.
[381.04] How can I believe you, mom?
[385.92] You found me on the middle 
of the road all alone
[390.68] like someone threw me off 
as a burden.
[400.80] These are all your things.
[413.88] We found you wrapped 
in these clothes
[420.20] and this,
[422.64] and you had this bracelet 
in your hand as well.
[447.44] Areej?
[454.24] My name was Areej.
[581.76] Arooj, I am asking you something, 
who is that girl, who is missing…
[585.40] My friend.
[588.92] She is my friend.
[593.72] One girl went missing from her 
acquaintances,
[603.04] so I just thought of trying to help her
in finding her,
[618.20] I am just trying that.
[661.32] Someone had kept you 
with a lot of love,
[667.48] this gold bracelet,
[673.00] these clothes,
[676.28] God knows
[678.76] what must have happened to you
[681.12] that you got separated 
from your parents.
[688.96] But Arooj,
[691.32] I have raised you exactly 
like my own child,
[696.68] I guess, if I had had a child 
of my own,
[700.16] I would have never loved her
[709.56] as much as I love you, 
I am telling you the truth,
[713.80] you,
[715.40] you tell me, tell me
[718.84] have you ever felt
[722.20] that you are not our child
[726.04] or we are not your parents.
[736.16] But that is the truth, Mom.
[745.88] Neither I am your child,
[749.64] nor you are my mother.
[762.08] I want to know, Mom,
[765.52] after all who are my actual parents?
[767.68] What happened to me? 
Where did they go?
[770.12] Why did they leave me?
[776.08] After looking at all these things I feel, 
I,
[779.92] I was very dear to my parents, 
they used to love me a lot.
[785.80] Then what happened 
in my life that
[788.88] I am here and God knows 
where did they go,
[792.08] so far away from me?
[795.28] Why did this happen to me?
[951.84] Sir Jr, shall I get water for you?
[957.12] No, let it be,
[959.04] where is Arooj?
[962.24] She is not at home.
[964.68] Okay, you may go.
[966.32] Okay.
[970.08] Amazing,
[972.08] she is your wife and 
you are asking people?
[975.24] You should know
 where your wife is.
[980.04] I called her,
[983.08] her number is switched off.
[985.84] Where can she go without telling you,
 Salman?
[995.64] This is beyond my understanding.
[998.56] Mom, I don’t get it myself that 
what has happened to her,
[1005.44] I don’t know why is she so worried for 
so many days, I don’t know what is the matter.
[1011.00] Salman, if you don’t know 
then who knows?
[1020.40] I will ask her.
[1028.72] For now,
[1030.96] I am very worried myself.
[1034.52] Look Salman, your worry,
[1042.24] you either get rid of it 
very soon or fix it.
[1088.24] Since the day this Arooj 
entered my son’s life,
[1092.04] She has destroyed the peace 
of my son’s life.
[1098.12] I don’t understand what should I do
about this girl.
[1213.76] Her fever hasn’t yet come down,
[1216.04] doctor was saying it will 
come down in an hour.
[1221.60] Here, I have brought the medicines,
[1228.68] did you give her the medicine 
that the doctor gave?
[1231.16] Yes, I did
[1233.52] but the fever still hasn’t come down.
[1235.76] It will come down, if God wills.
[1238.76] My girl wouldn’t have been so exhausted
if the doctor had given a medicine
[1243.12] that would help the temperature 
come down quickly.
[1247.48] Arooj?
[1250.28] Yes?
[1252.08] Yes, Mom’s life?
[1255.16] Arooj?
[1257.08] Now see, our Arooj’s fever 
will get away in a snap,
[1260.76] it will get absolutely fine, right?
[1345.28] Arooj, my child,
[1352.72] your Dad is calling you, come.
[1488.40] she is your wife and 
you are asking people?
[1491.56] You should know 
where your wife is.
[1495.40] Where can she go without
telling you, Salman?
[1498.40] This is beyond my understanding.
[1501.36] Mom, I don’t get it myself that 
what has happened to her,
[1506.36] I don’t know why is she so worried
 for so many days,
[1508.48] I don’t know what is the matter.
[1511.92] Salman, if you don’t know
[1515.40] then who knows?
[1518.24] For now, I am very worried myself.
[1523.84] Look Salman, your worry,
[1528.16] you either get rid of it very soon
or fix it.
[1660.48] Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier?
[1668.52] My child, now that you have found it,
[1671.68] look at your condition,
[1681.76] had we told you earlier your personality 
would have shattered completely.
[1698.24] My child, control yourself,
[1701.96] you are the only reason that I 
and Naseema are alive.
[1710.56] The love for both of you will never 
decrease from my heart
[1728.28] but I want to find my parents,
[1742.60] will you help me?
[1746.20] Definitely, my child.
[1754.12] We even tried before
[1773.52] but my child,
[1777.88] don’t ruin your future while 
you are finding your past.
[1871.52] Arooj?
[1880.00] Arooj, my child,
[1884.56] I don’t know how to talk intellectually
like your dad,
[1900.20] but we hid this all from you
till date
[1907.20] because I didn’t want you 
to get away from me.
[2016.04] My child, now that 
you have found it,
[2021.80] look at your condition,
[2032.80] had we told you earlier your personality
would have shattered completely.
[2059.92] My child, control yourself,
[2068.08] you are the only reason that 
I and Naseema are alive.
[2082.84] My child,
[2086.92] don’t ruin your future while 
you are finding your past.
[2130.56] Hello?
[2131.88] Arooj, where are you?
[2135.96] At mom’s house.
[2138.04] Mom’s house?
[2144.08] So at least you should have informed
when you were leaving.
[2148.44] I would have told you
[2151.12] if I had known anything myself.
[2154.56] What do you mean?
[2157.16] Nothing,
[2159.64] you were calling, tell me?
[2163.28] Arooj, what happened to you?
[2164.92] You have been behaving so strangely
for past so many days,
[2167.16] what has happened?
[2170.32] Nothing has happened to me,
Salman,
[2173.08] don’t worry.
[2174.64] I shouldn’t worry?
[2177.08] How should I not worry 
when you are here, Arooj?
[2184.64] You always embarrass me
in front of Mom.
[2188.72] If you think that then okay,
[2194.00] I am sorry,
[2201.76] but I never wanted that.
[2204.68] Arooj,
[2207.08] what has happened?
[2214.28] You can at least tell me, 
you can share it with me.
[2218.00] Salman, look I was missing 
Mom and Dad a lot,
[2221.56] so I have come here,
[2229.64] and I want to live here for a few days,
and please don’t disturb me.
[2233.76] Bye.
[2236.48] yes, but Arooj…
[2239.08] Arooj?
[2256.68] What is wrong with her?
