Salman. It is good I found you here, 
I was coming to your room. Go ahead, son. Are you worried? 
Is everything fine? Yes. I am worried cause of Arooj. Why? Did Arooj say something? That’s the problem. She is not saying anything. She is quiet in response 
to every question. So child, what should that girl do? She says anything, Mehreen has 
an issue, if she doesn’t, then you. Aunt, I am really serious 
about this matter. You also understand this, that last night Mehreen made her 
apologize and insulted her. Now if she is quiet, 
then let her be quiet. Give her some time, 
she will be fine. No. Something is wrong with Arooj. 
There is something wrong. Wrong? Tell me clearly what the matter is. You know what? Her mother was unwell, 
and she didn’t go to meet her. When I told her that I will take her, 
she said no. You tell me yourself, 
isn’t this strange? Really? It is strange. She really loves her mother. Exactly, now you tell me yourself, should I 
not get serious for this matter? So, you think this as well that after that happened, 
it is possible that the mother and daughter 
have some friction. I don’t know. That is why I need to confirm this. You try to talk to Arooj. I will talk to her, 
you don’t worry. You go to the office. Where is Arooj? I don’t know. Fine, you go, I will talk to her. Her mother was unwell, and
 she didn’t go to meet her. When I told her that I will take her, 
she said no. You tell me yourself, 
isn’t this strange? Why do I feel there is a secret that you don’t want to share with me? it is better that some secrets 
remain secrets. What do you mean? If they get revealed, they become a story full of fun 
for the world, and the one whose secret it is, 
a torture for them. Arooj, what are you saying? I feel I am talking to such an Arooj, 
who I don’t know. If you want, I can drop you to your mother’s home. You will feel better. No. Wont you go to ask how she is? What happened to her? She must be fine. Why are you talking in 
such a cold tone? The ones who burn in their own sorrow, they become of this cold tone. If I am not wrong, then are you having an issue
 with your mother? Arooj, you are sitting here and I was going to look for you 
in your room. Sit. What happened to you? Huh? Salman sent you here too? Yes, think that. You can talk to me, right? Tell me, what is the matter? What? That what is the issue between 
you and your mother? There is no issue, aunt. Look here. She is your mother, child. You don’t get upset with 
your mother. If there is something,
 then I will come along. I will talk to your mother. 
I will make her understand. Thank you so much that 
you thought of doing this. But there are certain things, that cannot even be resolved, 
even after being cleared. This means, there is something. Right? Yes. There is always something 
in everything. The only difference is that at times that thing weighs more, 
at times it weighs less. Fine, I got it. You don’t want to tell me. You don’t consider me your own. The ones who I considered 
my own, they… Aunt, it is just you in this home, whom I can call my own. I know child. That’s it, now you will go to your mother, 
you will meet her. And this is my order. I will not hear anything else,
 okay? I will have to go now, it is aunt’s orders. Fine aunt, I will go. Live long. Greetings sir. 
Greetings. Hello. Yes, Salman. How are you? I am fine, buddy, but this time Arooj is in a weird condition 
this time. You must have done something weird. No, nothing like that. Then aunt Mehreen must have 
said something. Not even that. Then ask her what the matter is. That’s the problem, man. Whenever I ask her, she doesn’t answer me,
she doesn’t tell me anything. Yes, but Salman, you must have 
some idea where the problem is. I feel that this time she has a complaint 
from her parents. My advice is Salman, 
let this matter go on like this. Give Arooj some time. She will tell you herself 
what the matter is. Okay, we will see. Fine, take care of yourself. Goodbye. Aunty, where is Arooj?
I don’t see her. Arooj? Arooj didn’t come here. She didn’t come here? But she told me on the phone that she was coming to ask how you are. Son, Salman, did she say that? Then why didn’t she come here? I don’t know. How long will you think like this? Master, if I don’t think, then what do I do? This changed behavior of Arooj 
really hurts me. Earlier, her phone used to be off, so I understood, but now it constantly rings and she doesn’t answer my call. After that incident, even I don’t have anything 
to console you. Does she herself also think that 
we married her at the wrong place? It is possible but I am sure, my daughter is really patient, and Salman loves her a lot. But there is something else. How will we find out 
what this something else is? Who will tell us, 
if Arooj doesn’t tell us? God knows. I will call her. Papa is calling? Hello. Greetings, papa. Greetings, child. 
How are you? I am fine. Child, your mother longs 
to talk to you. Here, talk to her. How are you child? I am fine, and you? You should have met me 
and asked me this. Do you have any idea how much your mother is waiting for you? I am coming. After all, asking how an ill person 
is a good deed. I will come with this relation. Master, the matter is something else, or else my Arooj cannot talk to me 
like this, like a stranger. I hadn’t even thought of this. It is so weird, the relation with which 
I spent my entire life, that turned to be just an acquaintance. Child, your mother longs to talk to you. Do you have any idea how much your mother is waiting for you? Arooj. Did you call me so far here,
in an emergency, to hear your silence? Speak up, what happened to you? I have nothing left to say. This never happens that 
you never have words to speak. Go ahead. If your words don’t support you 
to say what you want, then what you do? Arooj, you don’t seem fine 
to me today, you don’t seem like the Arooj 
from earlier to me. You are right. I am really not the same Arooj 
has earlier, maybe that Arooj is lost. Not you are scaring me Arooj. Look, if you have a worry in your heart, 
then tell me. Keeping it in your heart like this, you will get worried further. 
Speak up. If you ever find out that your parents are not 
your real parents, you are not their daughter, then what will you do? What are you saying? This only happens in dramas, this doesn’t happen in real life. It has happened. This has happened. With whom? With me. This happened with me. Shanzay my parents are not 
my real parents. I am not their daughter. What are you saying? Did uncle and aunty tell you 
this themselves? No. They would never have told me this,
themselves. Both of them love me so much. And if they had to tell me this, 
then maybe, they would have told me this 
a long time back. Then Arooj, how did you find out
all this yourself? I went home, so mama and papa were talking
to each other, and I heard it all. Arooj, if you get free from your father’s advice, then give some time to your mother too. This is good that mother’s wait and 
make arrangements, and when the daughter comes then 
the family shows their right on them. Hey, see, I have come to my mother. I get it all. I understand it all, 
Naseema. You are turning my daughter against me, 
that too in front of me. Can I also take some time,
 if you don’t mind. Take it. Take it. Come on, come. Master, this is the grocery list, bring it. Thank God, Arooj’s mood got fine. How do you know? I am saying it because 
she agreed to come over. Okay, you can make your guesses. We will find out when she comes. Daughters getting upset. You know she used to get upset
 on small things and then she would agree herself. Okay, you quickly get these groceries 
and yes, bring it from the place our daughter 
Arooj likes it. Yes, yes, I will bring it from there. Okay? I will just come. Man, Arooj, I want to console you but I don’t understand what do I say 
that will bring peace to your heart. Maybe now no word can 
console my heart. You are my friend. That is why I told you 
what is in my heart. Now I feel that I only have darkness in my life. My love, don’t say that. You will see, one day 
everything will be fine, and there will also be light. Yes? Don’t worry. You take care of yourself. You too. 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Loves makes a person fearless 
and brave. Your mother has a small heart, and also the mind… Yes, yes only you are the smart one here,
master. Mama, papa is taunting you. Hey yes, I have a news. 
I forgot to tell you. I have an interview call tomorrow. Oh wow, from where? In a multinational company. 
It is a really good opportunity, papa. My daughter will surely 
be successful. Once I get this job, then all of us will go on 
an international trip. Oh wow. How do relations suddenly change into
an acquaintance within a moment. You can have an acquaintance 
with anyone. It is the relation that is important, that is not broken even when you are not
together or your hands aren’t holding each other. I have such a relation somewhere. Who do I make my own? I have become a stranger. I have become no one. Now the pain has increased. I wish I had not heard all this. But there are certain things, that cannot even be resolved, 
even after being cleared. This means, there is something. 
Right? Yes. There is always something 
in everything. The only difference is that at times that thing weighs more, 
at times it weighs less. Fine, I got it. You don’t want to tell me. You don’t consider me your own. The ones who I considered 
my own, they… Greetings. Greetings. Did you talk to Arooj? 
Did she tell you something? No, she didn’t tell me anything, but I have guessed myself. What guess? That there is surely some issue 
between the mother and daughter. But how can there be an issue? Those two are really attached. I too have just guessed. I have sent Arooj to go 
and meet her parents. When she comes back, then 
we will find out what the issue is. I hope this matter resolves soon. Don’t worry. Go and get fresh. Naseema, what is the matter? Why are you worried? Master, why has my Arooj 
not come till now? Now you start imaging that Arooj is not coming. When she has said she will come, 
she will surely come. My heart is really weird. 
I feel that I am waiting for a guest. When daughters get married, 
they come like guests. They stay for a while and leave. So, she should come at least. There, our Arooj is here. Arooj. Arooj, what happened, child?
