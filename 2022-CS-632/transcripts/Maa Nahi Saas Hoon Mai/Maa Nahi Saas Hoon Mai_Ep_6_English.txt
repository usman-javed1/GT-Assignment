Salman, come on, have dinner, please. I don’t want to eat. Why? Why don’t you want to eat? What am I asking you? Why are you asking me? Why are you asking? Do you even care about me? You did what you wanted to, and because of that,
 I shouldn’t have done what I did. What is wrong Salman that you are misbehaving with
 your mother like this? You don’t care about me at all. You only care about yourself. Salman, my love, I am only living for you. Then why don’t you care 
about my happiness? You are doing all this for that girl? Yes, I am doing it. I am surely doing it because of her. But you don’t understand. But I will tell you one thing, I will make sure I get that girl. Then you too remember one thing, I will never let that happen. Then fine, you live in this grand home 
with this decision of yours. I am leaving this 
home and going. What do you mean 
you are going, leaving this home? 
Salman. Salman. Salman,
 listen to me… Salman. Salman, stop. Salman, son, listen to me.
 Salman. Salman, listen… Salman. Salman, where are you going? 
Stop, son. Salman. Where is he going? You go and stop him. Look at him. Nothing will happen,
 he will come He will come back. Do you see? Do you see brother Idrees? Salman left the home and went. And you know why? Because of a girl. My Salman, my son, left his mother for 
the sake of a girl. Don’t worry, Mehreen, 
Salman will come. How will he not come? I will not let him stay outside 
the home like this. I have brought him up. How can I handover 
my son to someone like this, and I stay empty handed myself. No. How can this happen? You do something. You go and check
 where he went. God forbid, what if he does something 
with himself. Shaista, Salman is not that stupid. Remain calm. Please. Idrees, you don’t understand. Listen to me. Idrees. Your mom is just like you. Take her into confidence. She won’t surrender so easily. Yes, fine, then, I am also her son. I don’t understand why mama doesn’t get how important that girl is for me. Urooj is my stubbornness and also my love. Salman, remain calm. This insistence of yours 
is ruining everything. At times you go to that girls home, at times you leave
 your home and go. I don’t understand why 
mama doesn’t get it? I have tried in every 
possible way, there is no point. Hey, where would he have gone? He would have gone to Nasir. You just tell me something, if Salman likes a girl, then what problem
 does Mehreen have? You know what the problem is. Mehreen cannot tolerate that someone else shows 
their right on Salman and if Salman comes 
home with his love, then you think yourself what condition Mehreen will be in. You mean to say that Salman 
will never get married? She will get married, but when Mehreen likes a girl. Hah, the mental state Mehreen is in, I don’t think Salman is going to 
get married any time soon. But Idrees, I am telling you, I cannot see my son 
suffering like this. He will get married where he wants. What will you do? I will do anything, but I will support 
Salman completely. You will not do any stupidity like this. What do you mean? See, Idrees, till it was 
about my existence, it was fine, but for Salman I will not 
be a silent spectator. Have you gone mad? Be quiet. I will not be quiet. But you don’t worry. Whatever I will do, I will do it after thinking. You are doing all this for that girl? I am surely doing it because of her. But I will tell you one thing, I will make sure I get that girl. Aunty wouldn’t have 
sit down comfortably. Neither will the poor 
thing sleep tonight. Aunty’s Call... No need to attend it. Oh please, this is against manners okay? And I have to go meet her later. Greetings aunty. Greetings Nasir. Is Salman at your place? Yes, yes, aunt, he is here. Let me talk to him. Aunty, he went to the washroom. Once he comes, I will 
make you talk to him. Okay, so this means my son doesn’t want to talk to me. Okay fine, goodbye. Rehman baba, take out the car. No brother, no. I am really scared of aunt. Did you see? I told her you are in the washroom, she caught me immediately. Don’t take aunt lightly. That is why I make you understand that take her into confidence, don’t fight with her too much. You don’t know her 
better than me. What was the need for you 
to come to Nasir’s home? What do you mean? You leave the home and go, and I don’t even come to look for you? I am asking you something else, 
mama. You tell me yourself, if I had an argument with you there, and refused to come, then what impression 
would it have formed. You are saying it like you didn’t tell him anything. Does he not know that you 
left home upset and angry? For God’s sake, mama, stop it. I am no longer a child. Hmm You are not a child, but you are surely my child and you can never forget this. And whatever I do, whatever I think is for 
your betterment, and since when did you 
starting smoking a pod? Okay, I am sorry. But you promise me, you will change your decision. Salman, right now, I am not in the mood
 to hear anything. First we will go home, then we will talk over there. Bring our bill. Bring it in a little while. Your bill has been paid, madam. It has been paid? Who paid it? That sir paid your bill. I was not like this earlier. I would stay lost in my own world. But then someone came in my life, they made me realize that life is not what I used to think. In fact, life is really different. And today on this occasion, I just want to say to 
that person, that, thanks for coming in my life and making my life beautiful. I like your daughter. I have come with a proposal for her. If you people don’t have
 an objection, then. I am really hungry today. I am so hungry, let’s order something. Hello? Where are you lost? I am talking to you. What happened? I am really hungry Urooj, let’s order something. I have lost my appetite. Please don’t tell me any 
bad news, right now. But it is not that good either. Okay tell me, what happened? He had come home with a wedding proposal. Who? The one who is after me. Salman. Oh my God, so romantic. Who else came with him? He was alone. What happened then? I dragged him out of the home. Urooj, how rude. Why did you drag him out? Don’t be so stupid. Him coming along was 
really insulting for me. Urooj, you didn’t do the right thing. I am really hungry, order something. You order. Waiter. Have tea. Amazing, wife of mine. I really wanted to have it. I was making it for myself, so I thought I would 
make it for you too. Thank you. I wanted to talk to you
 about something. Go ahead. That day, the boy who
 came for Urooj. I really liked him a lot. Yes, nothing was bad about 
him on the face of it. He is from an affluent home. Yes, he was from a good home. What do you want to say? But Urooj didn’t do good 
insulting him. that’s the difference, Urooj felt that him coming
 over was insulting for us. Why do you always 
negate what I say? Okay fine, tell me clearly what
 you want to say? I want to say that, the boy was really good. I have always wished that I get a proposal from such an 
affluent home for my Urooj. Yes, but not like this. If he would have come
 with his elders, then we would have 
surely thought about this. Urooj hasn’t come till now. Where is she? She must be on her way. You are not having anything. Yes. Okay. Did the mother and 
son make truce? Why would us mother and 
son fight brother Idrees. Salman is still young, so he doesn’t understand a few things. You are his mother, who can think better of 
what is good and bad for him. That’s what I make Salman 
understand that he wouldn’t know the difference 
between good and bad. I will bring a girl I like as
 a bride for Salman, he will praise me all his life. That is correct. For God’s sake, please, stop it you people. If I am not saying anything, this doesn’t mean, 
I will agree to you. Urooj… yes her name is Urooj. I really love her and I will marry her as well. And this is my final decision. If she doesn’t understand, then at least you understand. This will never happen. Finish your breakfast. No, I am fine. Hey, you can do what you want, but I want no issues in this home. We expect good from you. Okay? Urooj. Urooj is a really pretty name, and I am sure your choice must also 
be really good. But son, what stupidity 
did you do? You went alone to their 
home with your proposal. I made a big mistake. After mama’s refusal, I took the proposal myself. You tell me yourself, will anyone marry their 
daughter to such a man who brings his own proposal? Okay tell me something, if some elder from this home
 takes the proposal, then will those people say yes? They surely will. They are a really good 
and decent family. Hmmm Does she like you too? Yes. Maybe. Then, done. I will go with my son’s
 proposal myself. In fact, we will go today. You will go? Thank you so much. How can you go sister-in-law? Why? Am I not the elder of this home? You are surely the elder of
 this home, sister-in-law, but I am Salman’s mother and with me there, it is not possible that someone
 else takes my son’s proposal, so you don’t bother, I will take my son’s 
proposal myself. Salman, you make preparations, we will go today with the proposal. Sister-in-law Shaista doesn’t let go of any opportunity where she doesn’t compete 
my love for Salman. I cannot let sister-in-law Shaista 
take my son’s proposal at any cost. I will fulfill every wish, every
 need of Salman. Whether I like it or not. Salman, I have become helpless
 because of you, but that girl will come and
 live with me, right? I will see, how she snatches you 
from me with her love. This… where did you bring me? Mom, Urooj lives here. Hmmm. Come on. Yes, come on. Come. My son doesn’t lack anything, he is the only son. Our daughter doesn’t
 lack anything either. She is also the only child. Think that our child 
is our entire world and she is also really beloved. That’s good. Your daughter is your beloved. My son is my beloved. I came here to ask for the 
proposal of two beloveds. I didn’t come here to look at Urooj, but in fact to ask for her hand. Greetings. Greetings. She is my son’s choice, so that’s it, I too like her. You seem like a soft spoken woman. Surely your daughter will soft spoken. Often blood shows its true colours. Yes. That’s how I have brought her up. After all, our Urooj is really intelligent. But I believe that blood always wins in 
front of upbringing. Blood always shows 
its true colours. Usually daughters take 
up after their mothers. Anyway, leave it, I want to make Urooj my daughter-in-law
 as soon as possible. You people tell me your will. Look sister, our daughter has to get married and we will not be able to make 
a decision without asking Urooj. That’s good, you people surely know her will. I will wait for the decision of you people. I just want to get this marriage done soon. I want to make Urooj my daughter-in-law 
as soon as possible. If you ask me honestly, I liked this boy at first sight. Where do you find such boys? And I really liked his mother a lot. Urooj, she talks so nicely. Why are you telling me all this? Okay, fine, we will not talk about this. No, no, I didn’t say that either. Okay, so then let’s talk about this. Child, tell me, what do you say about this? Should your papa and I say yes? As you wish, mama. I have left my life’s 
decision on you. Yes, but this is an important 
decision of your life, and we don’t want it to 
happen without your will. You like Salman, right? You say yes. She felt shy. She is crazy. Oh God, thank you. Such a good proposal has 
come for my daughter, the boy is so good, the family is so good. That’s it. Thank God, may my daughter live happy
 in that home as well. What are you thinking holding 
bracelet in your hands? I am thinking we should tell Urooj the truth, that she is not our real daughter. What are you saying, Naseema? Hearing this Urooj will be really hurt, and I don’t want to give any sorrow
 to my daughter in this happy occasion. But master, she will find out someday. Never. Never. We will take secret of Urooj that she is not our daughter to our grave. Why did you think of this? Just like that. Now it is time for her to go 
to someone else’s home. Master, the gift God gave 
us in our childless life, it is time for that gift to depart. Master, when we had 
found her yesterday, it seems as though 
it was just yesterday. Master, stop the car. Stop the car, master. What happened? I can hear a child cry. Huh? Hey, no, you must be hearing things. Hear it carefully, I can hear it. Yes, Naseema, I can hear it. You wait, I will go and see. Okay, you stay here.
