I want to bring something 
in the court’s notice, that is, Mr. Salman Ahmad and 
his father Idrees Ahmad, have taken control of the entire 
property by using a piece of paper, which is a caretaking document, as the basis for the past 
twenty years. Yes, so that’s how it is. All this belongs to my late uncle. This reveals two things. Firstly, you are not the owner and secondly, 
when Waqar Ahmad’s wife, Mehreen is alive, then why is she not the owner 
of this entire property? Mr. Judge, I disagree with my friend’s argument 
on this matter. I don’t understand if he wants to make Mehreen Ahmad
 the owner of Arooj Ahmad. It is the same thing, Mr. Judge. No matter whoever is the owner 
out of these two, but the owner is not the one who has seized the property till now. Thank you, Mr. Salman. 
You can leave. Thank you very much. Mr. Judge, I seek permission to present one more 
witness for madam Arooj’s claim. Permission granted. Madam Mehreen, come. Yes, madam, go ahead, 
say what you want to say. Mr. Judge, there is no doubt in this, that this entire business, wealth, belonged to my late husband
 Waqar Ahmad. When our only daughter was born, 
then… Look at this, mama. Areej. It is so beautiful. See, Mehreen. The name is really beautiful. So, you named her by
your liking, right? Yes, because Areej is a really 
beautiful name. Right, mama? Yes, it is a beautiful name, son. Now our whole home will be 
filled with her scent. Here, mama, put it on Areej’s wrist with your hands. I will take it out. My little doll. Here you go. Mehreen, Waqar has left us and gone. He left? Where did he go? Waqar is no longer in this world. My son left, Mehreen. Waqar… Waqar… Call Waqar. Call Waqar. Call him. Mr. Judge, this is the entire story. Arooj is the only owner of my late 
husband Waqar Ahmad’s entire business and property. The rest were just caretakers Does the defendant’s lawyer you wish
to ask something from the witness? No, sir I don’t want to ask any question
from Mehreen Ahmad, the reason is that her statement 
has no legal standing. And I want to show you 
a report, Mr. Judge. Mr. Judge, this report clearly states that Mehreen Ahmad is a 
mental patient. Whatever stories she has told us, she has just wasted 
the court’s time with it. There is nothing in it 
that can be believable. Objection your honour. I admit, Mehreen Ahmad was 
a mental patient, but now she is completely healthy. Mr. Judge, we will have to run 
another case to inquire about who is mentally fit and 
who is not fit. Thank you, sir. This court is adjourned for
 half an hour. If someone has any proof 
or witness, they should present them to 
the court immediately. Adjourned. Be strong, mama. If you continue to cry like this, then I too will lose my strength. What do I do, if I don’t cry? Salman must be laughing proving me
to be a mental patient. How can he do this? You still don’t believe what 
Salman is capable of? He came in my arms, 
from sister in law Shaista’s arms. I brought him up every moment, and made grow up so big, and he must be laughing 
at his mother. How? I am here. Your daughter is with you. Yes, you are with me. My own daughter. But what use am I as a mother, if I couldn't even testify for 
my own daughter? You are a mother, who is standing
 with me in such a time. A mother never leaves 
her daughter alone. That is the type of mother you are. Don’t worry, such questions are asked in court. Those people are putting 
in their entire effort, but we will not step back either. 
We will try our best too. I will assure of one thing, whether we win or lose the case, they won’t get anything either. Be strong, everything will be fine. Wow, son, Salman, wow. You are more sensible 
than your father. You have made all the preparations. And as far as Mehreen is concerned,
she is mad. Who will listen to a mad person?
Huh? The world will see the condition of Arooj and her mother will be in 
after losing the case. Hmmm. Hey, half an hour has passed. Mr. Lawyer, finish this case today. Yes, just watch. I also have to earn my fee lawfully too. Yes. 
Come on. Come on. 
Come on. Come, son. Master, God be kind, Arooj and sister Mehreen have 
still not come from court. You get late in such matters, 
Naseema. I am really scared. Those people can do anything. Don’t worry, hope for the best. Amen. Is it not possible that Arooj give them everything 
as charity for her life. And charity increases the life, and I am saying all this 
for Arooj’s protection. No Naseema, you shouldn’t leave your right, nor should you stop anyone’s right. You just pray that Arooj 
wins this case. Amen. If a modest person steps back 
from something, then the immodest person thinks
that he is a coward. And you know, not raising your voice for your right 
is a big ungratefulness towards God. I have decided. I will stand up for my right and now I will not listen 
to anyone of you. I can say with surety that this girl Arooj’s desire is nothing
but greed for wealth and lies. The decision of lies and greed will be
made in a little while. You wait here. I seek permission from the honourable court
to present another witness for this claim. Permission granted. Thank you very much. 
You call her. Mr. Judge, this is Wasai, 
daughter of Aslam. She has spent thirty years of her life
as a servant in Waqar Ahmad’s home, where Arooj Ahmad was born. And the circle of life turned 
in such a way, that she got married and came back
to that same home. She knows about the entire condition
and situation of that home. I would request the court to give her 
permission to speak about that. Wasai, you tell us. yes, tell us, what do you know? Sir, it is just me, who knows everything. I have seen the rise of elder madam
in that home, when her daughter was born. Then I saw younger madam, becoming a daughter in law, and also as the wife of little master. And time shows such colours, today, the real owners of the home 
are out of the home. They should be given their right. This is a court room, madam. Your emotional speech will 
not work here. Let her talk. Emotions are natural when talking 
about human and human relations. Yes, madam, 
what do you want to say? Mr. Judge, twenty-two years ago, elder sir, put all his wealth in the name of his daughter,
younger madam, in front of you. Defendant’s lawyer, do you want to ask Wasai something? Mr. Judge, this woman said 
what she wanted to, but is this woman worthy that 
we believe her testimony. What do you say, Mr. Idrees? Yes. Yes. Yes, Mr. Judge, she is surely our old servant, but we fired her from the job 
some time back due to theft. Her habit of theft was increasing and she is testifying falsely today,
to take revenge for that. Since she was our old servant, we didn’t find it right to file a report 
with the police. Wasai, did you steal at Mr. Idrees’ home?
Did he drag you out of his home? Yes, but I didn’t steal anything. I didn’t steal anything. Who admits after stealing 
whether they stole or not. Mr. Judge, the biggest of lies 
is something, Arooj Ahmad has spoken. I request you to call Arooj Ahmad 
to the witness box, so that her lies can be revealed. The two witnesses Arooj presented 
to prove her innocence, they are in front of you. One of them is a mental patient, and the other has an allegation 
of theft on her. Apart from that, 
she has a copy of a paper, according to which she is the owner. And even the original document for that has still not been found, Mr. Judge. Mr. Judge, I want to say something. Say what you want to by coming
in the witness box. Sure. Mr. Judge, neither is my mother a mental patient, and neither has Wasai stolen anything. All these are allegations being put on 
my witnesses to make them insignificant. Mr. Judge, we got the copy of the stamp paper 
with difficulty. I am Arooj Ahmad, late Waqar Ahmad’s lost daughter. I am the owner of this entire wealth, 
Mr. Judge. Okay fine, we will accept for 
a few moments that the testimony of both 
the women is true and the copy of the stamp paper is fine. As for being the daughter of Waqar 
Ahmad and Mehreen Ahmad, who went missing 
twenty-two years ago, it was when Arooj Ahmad 
married Salman Ahmad and came to this home that she heard the story 
of a lost girl. She had a greed in her mind, then she started getting herself called 
as a lost child, to seize the entire wealth. And Mr. Judge, this is not the real deal. The real thing is that Arooj Ahmad is not the daughter of Waqar Ahmad
 and Mehreen Ahmad. Therefore, I request you to expedite 
the dismissal of this case based on deceit and impose the strictest possible 
punishment on Arooj Ahmad in the fraud case. thank you, Sir. The court is adjourned 
for two weeks. We are adjourned for next 
couple of weeks. Adjourned. What will happen now, Mr. Lawyer? Will the law punish my daughter? Nothing like that will happen. Even if claim is rejected, still court will not give Arooj 
any punishment. The issue is that Salman Ahmad 
and his lawyer are presenting something against every 
witness of ours, that the court is accepting. Now the next hearing will be 
the final hearing, and if Arooj’s claim is not proven 
to be true, then… Do you even have to prove the truth, 
Mr. Lawyer? Yes. Don’t worry, we will win this case. The deserving always gets 
their right. Even if it is in the control 
of tyrants for ages! Yes, that’s how it will be. What will we do now, Arooj? Do whatever you want, it will be of no benefit. I will deprive you people of 
every single penny. There is still time Arooj, plead forgiveness from me. Who knows, I might forgive you. I didn’t bring you up in this manner,
 Salman. Firstly, you are lying and you are also standing 
strong on it? Mama, don’t waste your tears 
in front of a stone. Come on. Come on, Wasai. Sure. Stone.
