[42.64] Now your madam Arooj 
is done for, Wasai.
[81.40] I will start searching for 
my parents again.
[84.80] And you will see,
[86.40] I will make sure I find them.
[89.04] Now won’t you get me sweets 
on this happy occasion?
[92.64] Hmmm…I will.
[95.28] But right now we have cake. 
Won’t cake be enough?
[108.08] Now the camel has come 
under the mountain.
[116.48] Arooj.
[125.48] I am surprised.
[127.16] I feel you are unable to sleep 
out of happiness for your win.
[133.08] Happiness for what win, aunty?
[139.56] I am a girl who has lost.
[142.76] You deliver these filmy dialogues
in front of Salman.
[148.56] I will not be affected by your tears.
[153.80] I am not shedding these tears for you,
[157.76] I am shedding them for me.
[160.84] Another dialogue.
[162.92] I know well about the innocence hiding
behind this face of yours, Arooj.
[170.96] Then teach me all this as well.
[178.04] How do you read the faces of people?
[214.16] You have finally come.
[220.40] I was waiting for you.
[227.84] Yes, I went to the doctor.
[232.44] Did I ask you?
[243.00] But no,
[245.96] I need to ask you.
[253.92] Where did you come from?
[257.68] I told you, I went to the doctor.
[261.04] Hey, no,
[264.76] who are you
[272.40] and where did you come 
in our home from?
[279.96] I have asked you this.
[287.36] I don’t understand.
[291.84] I will tell you.
[299.44] You are an abandoned girl.
[316.68] No one knows who her parents are.
[337.16] This was the entire thing.
[354.28] Who told you all this?
[360.36] You.
[369.76] But you didn’t tell me this,
[372.96] I heard it myself.
[382.64] And it is good that I heard it
[385.56] or else my son
[390.64] would have lived his whole life 
in the misunderstanding
[394.12] that madam Arooj is the child 
if really respectable
[399.80] and good people.
[417.92] But now the tables have been turned.
[427.24] No one knows who is Arooj the child of.
[435.36] Aunty, you are not speaking good.
[439.12] I am just speaking.
[447.64] You just don’t find it good.
[462.48] But yes, you don’t worry,
[470.24] I will not tell anyone anything.
[479.20] Because you are the respect of this home,
[482.32] my daughter in law and 
my Salman’s wife.
[500.04] But if you don’t remain Salman’s wife,
[505.44] and that you surely won’t remain,
[520.84] then I will tell everyone
[531.64] that thank God
[534.00] we got rid of an abandoned girl.
[573.64] It is my fault.
[581.88] Aunt Mehreen found out 
because of my negligence.
[595.24] So much tension.
[602.64] I am going to be a mother.
[610.48] I will not be able to tolerate 
so much stress.
[619.16] Oh God, what has happened.
[631.00] What do I do?
[647.20] I will have to inform Salman.
[763.92] Yes, Arooj. Go ahead.
[765.92] Salman.
[768.04] Salman, I am really scared.
[770.56] Scared?
[772.64] Scared of what?
[776.00] When I just came to my room,
[778.04] aunt Mehreen was already sitting there.
[781.36] What is there to worry in this?
[784.12] She has found out that I am a lost girl,
[787.68] and no one knows about my parents.
[792.12] What?
[795.36] How did mom find out?
[798.08] What do we do now, Salman?
[803.40] I am sure, aunt Mehreen is going 
to create a big scene at home.
[807.68] You please come home quickly.
[810.20] Don’t worry. 
I am coming immediately.
[812.44] Okay.
[832.64] I just need one help from you.
[836.52] Whether I am lost or 
my parents are lost,
[839.56] no one should find out about this.
[843.68] Because if aunt Mehreen finds out,
[847.32] then she will ruin my life
[852.76] or
[854.96] she will find another excuse 
to get us divorced.
[869.48] Arooj, please believe me.
[876.32] In future, no excuse or reality
[881.12] will not force me to take such decisions.
[963.56] Who told you?
[964.68] Mehreen.
[965.80] And you believed her?
[967.64] So why should I not believe her?
[972.88] I had asked Arooj, 
she didn’t have an answer.
[978.16] This means, there is truth in this. 
Meaning,
[980.60] Arooj is not Master Shoaib and 
Naseema’s daughter?
[985.80] And you see,
[988.04] those people fulfilled the complete 
responsibility of being parents.
[996.16] They didn’t let us have any doubts.
[998.96] Shaista, doubt? Now I am sure.
[1002.64] Sure about what?
[1003.76] That only an abandoned girl 
can do the things
[1006.36] that Arooj has done at home 
and in the business.
[1011.08] Idrees, I don’t know what you are saying.
[1014.92] Right now, I am worried thinking
[1018.60] how Mehreen will treat Arooj.
[1051.40] Oh wow, my heart is really happy.
[1058.60] It feels like it rained after 
extreme hot weather.
[1064.88] I should surely share this happiness 
with someone.
[1071.24] Who? Who? Who? 
Yes. Yes.
[1082.52] How can you accept that 
your wife is an abandoned girl?
[1088.00] When she is my wife, 
then how can she be abandoned?
[1095.56] And what hell has broken loose?
[1097.72] Children are adopted as well,
[1099.84] and they are also brought up
 in orphanages.
[1106.40] So, don’t they get married and 
even if they get married,
[1110.20] then does their past ruin 
their future?
[1114.76] So, you are refusing to 
accept my order?
[1117.08] There is nothing like that.
[1120.08] I am just talking about what is just.
[1127.76] And if you think that what I am saying
is going against your order,
[1131.72] then fine,
[1133.32] I will apologize for this.
[1167.68] Why does this boy not understand?
[1170.52] God knows what parents’ blood 
is this girl?
[1177.60] Abandoned.
[1210.92] You are an abandoned girl.
[1228.20] No one knows who her parents are.
[1234.68] I heard this myself
[1239.40] and it is good I heard it,
[1242.16] or else, my son
[1245.00] would have spent his entire life 
in this misunderstanding
[1248.84] that madam Arooj is the child 
of really respectable
[1254.28] and good people.
[1259.84] But,
[1261.60] now the tables have been turned.
[1266.44] No one knows who is Arooj the child of.
[1274.56] Aunty, you are not speaking good.
[1278.32] I am just speaking.
[1282.08] You just don’t find it good.
[1384.12] When she is my wife, then 
how can she be abandoned?
[1388.24] And what hell has broken loose?
[1390.28] Children are adopted as well,
[1392.28] and they are also brought up 
in orphanages.
[1396.12] So, don’t they get married and 
even if they get married,
[1399.96] then does their past ruin their future?
[1404.36] So, you are refusing to 
accept my order?
[1406.64] There is nothing like that.
[1409.72] I am just talking about what is just.
[1415.08] And if you think that what I am saying
is going against your order,
[1419.16] then fine,
[1420.64] I will apologize for this.
[1429.20] Arooj is going to become a mother,
[1436.72] she still hasn’t become one yet.
[1442.64] But Salman is giving so much 
importance to Arooj,
[1453.72] that even after hearing 
something so big,
[1457.20] he is not surprised,
[1462.60] nor does he feel any shame.
[1467.80] How is this possible?
[1474.28] We don’t know about the parents 
of Salman’s wife,
[1483.24] and Salman doesn’t care.
[1490.60] The girl who doesn’t know of 
her parents will give Salman a heir.
[1504.64] Salman’s family will be ruined.
[1521.60] Wasai.
[1526.00] Where did she go?
[1528.48] She is not even in the kitchen, 
nor is she here.
[1531.92] My medication is with her.
[1534.68] Wasai.
[1604.08] Who is this girl with aunt Mehreen?
[1627.08] Yes. Yes.
[1628.56] You will get your money on the first.
[1631.32] Don’t call me daily and bother me.
[1636.16] I don’t have so much money
[1638.84] that I send it to you daily.
[1649.48] Wasai.
[1651.40] Wasai.
[1652.68] Put the phone down.
[1655.44] Younger madam is in my quarter?
[1659.76] Coming, younger madam.
[1665.40] What is Arooj doing in Wasai’s quarter?
[1674.24] I will go and see.
[1689.80] I apologize, younger madam.
[1692.52] My husband called,
[1695.16] so I got late in talking to him 
on the phone.
[1730.76] Who is this girl with aunt Mehreen,
 Wasai?
[1737.52] As far as I feel,
[1741.28] this is uncle Waqar,
[1744.80] but this girl…
[1748.32] who is this girl?
[1751.96] Where is this girl now?
[1765.12] What did I ask you that you are 
not answering me, Wasai?
[1769.64] Tell me, I am asking you something.
[1773.64] That…
[1774.92] that…
[1776.08] Wasai.
[1778.56] Wasai.
[1784.40] Yes, elder madam.
[1810.16] What are you doing here?
[1813.16] Aunty, I came to look for Wasai.
[1819.48] She was not even in the kitchen,
[1821.64] so I thought she would be here. 
She has my medication.
[1826.04] Give them to me, Wasai. 
Sure.
[1892.44] Wasai,
[1894.48] what did madam Arooj 
come to do here?
[1898.72] What is going on between you two?
[1903.64] No, no, elder madam,
[1906.20] you are mistaken.
[1908.76] Her medicine was left here.
[1911.72] I was talking to my husband,
[1916.44] so I forgot.
[1918.52] She came to get it.
[1922.44] You too need to get treated Wasai.
[1987.32] Wasai, did you throw that frame?
[1991.20] Yes, madam, I threw it outside.
[1995.12] Yes, don’t take it home.
[1997.04] It has termites on it.
[1998.56] No, no, madam,
[2000.28] you know I don’t take anything 
from here to my home.
[2005.40] I did as you told me.
[2009.52] Fine, you can leave.
[2068.36] We found you wrapped 
in these clothes
[2072.28] and this bracelet was also 
in your hands.
[2102.48] Areej.
[2109.20] My name was Areej.
[2120.56] What sort of coincidence is this?
[2130.68] Both the bracelets are identical.
[2140.36] And both have Areej written on them.
[2151.40] But where is that child, who is in 
aunt Mehreen’s arms, now?
[2209.40] Arooj. 
Yes?
[2215.08] What thoughts are you lost in?
[2226.76] You have your medicine in your hands 
and you didn’t eat your medicine.
[2237.32] What are you waiting for?
[2245.16] And maybe you are forgetting,
[2248.00] the doctor has instructed that 
you don’t have to think.
[2259.32] Come on, quickly take 
your medication,
[2262.08] I will go get fresh.
[2295.24] I get to see and hear 
something new, daily.
[2302.48] But a person can only think.
