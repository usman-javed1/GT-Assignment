[20.64] Master, my driver has visited 
you twice and come back,
[23.40] and you didn’t give the clothes.
[25.36] You had promised to give 
the clothes on Thursday.
[28.08] I will not make him visit 
again and again.
[31.64] Fine, I am sending 
Nawaz tomorrow,
[33.32] you send all my clothes.
[35.96] Madam, tea.
[37.96] Yes. Iron the clothes that 
are kept there.
[40.68] Sure, madam.
[42.44] Wasai.
[43.64] yes, madam?
[45.24] You take out the clothes 
from my suitcase
[47.08] and set them in the cupboard again.
[50.72] Yes, younger madam, as you order.
[56.16] Why child?
[58.08] Why are you unpacking 
all the clothes?
[61.72] I am not going.
[67.00] I said no to Salman.
[69.36] But why?
[76.00] Did you see sister-in-law, Shaista.
[80.36] Salman didn’t agree when
 I asked him,
[83.08] but he said no as soon 
as Arooj said.
[88.00] Wow Arooj, you did great.
[91.72] You made my son follow 
your orders.
[102.56] I have surely said no, aunty,
[105.80] but you are the reason for the order.
[109.72] When you have made fun 
of my order involving Salman,
[115.00] then it is better that the 
two of you go.
[136.76] Child, what did you do?
[140.40] What did I explain to you?
[151.40] You are really good, aunt.
[161.12] But I don’t want happiness 
that is loaned from someone.
[186.28] I had never imagined such 
a life, Salman.
[191.16] Arooj, trust me,
[194.72] it will all be okay.
[196.76] It is so torturous.
[198.76] What sort of a life is this?
[205.80] Is there not a single moment,
[207.52] where I can feel peace.
[213.20] It is really disappointing for me that 
you don’t find peace with me here.
[221.04] No Salman, I did not say that.
[228.08] I have no complaints from you.
[231.48] Only you are my own.
[237.76] You know,
[240.16] when I talk to you,
[241.44] I forget all my sorrows and worries.
[247.12] Don’t ever think that.
[250.64] Then have faith,
[253.48] mom too will become yours one day.
[262.32] I wish.
[269.68] But Salman,
[273.08] I am tired of the same daily life.
[277.28] I have nothing to do in my life.
[281.56] I can understand.
[288.24] I know you are suffering
 from mom’s injustice.
[300.40] But I have an idea.
[305.08] What idea?
[307.28] To remove the boredom from your life.
[312.64] What is that? Tell me.
[314.76] You have done your MBA 
in finance, right?
[318.72] Yes.
[319.44] Then why don’t you join the 
finance department in our office?
[329.20] Really?
[330.40] Yes, why not?
[332.32] Will this be possible?
[334.40] Why won’t it be possible?
[338.84] Fine, Salman,
[341.20] I will join the office
[342.44] and thank you so much.
[345.72] My pleasure.
[357.92] Yes, Mr. Ahmad, tell me.
[361.64] Yes, I had sent them the email….
[389.44] Thank God,
[392.04] I finally some change in my life.
[395.12] I will go to the office.
[397.84] Why did I not give this 
good news to Shanzay?
[401.48] I will call her.
[417.08] Hello.
[417.88] Hello Shanzay. 
I have a good news.
[421.84] No, greetings, no salutations, 
directly the news?
[424.60] Hey, leave the formality,
[426.28] right now listen to me.
[428.00] I feel it is a really good news.
 Okay tell me.
[432.76] I am joining Salman’s 
office from tomorrow.
[435.88] Oh wow, that’s a great news.
[438.12] Yes, and that too as 
a finance director.
[442.56] Now I feel I will have to 
call madam Arooj, madam.
[446.40] Shut up. What is 
wrong with you?
[449.92] I used to get so bored at home,
[451.52] the same routine of daily life.
[455.28] Now at least,
[456.68] I have something to do in my life.
[460.08] Okay, that’s good,
[461.08] you have a family business
[462.16] and your participation will be 
beneficial for this business.
[466.60] Yes, and most importantly,
[470.68] I will also be saved from aunt 
Mehreen’s taunts all day long.
[476.92] You are right about that.
[503.20] This is Miss Hadia.
[504.76] She heads our project side.
[507.84] Greetings.
[509.44] Greetings.
[511.48] Come.
[516.12] Tell me, is Miss Arooj’s 
room ready?
[519.64] Yes, sir, for now we have arranged 
the room in front for madam.
[524.32] Alright. Come, 
let me show you.
[526.80] Sure.
[528.04] Sir, did you call?
[531.08] Arooj, meet him.
[534.72] He is Mr. Nawaz,
[536.56] our finance manager.
[538.36] Greetings madam.
[539.76] Greetings
[541.88] and Nawaz, meet my wife,
[545.04] Arooj Salman.
[547.48] The new director of our 
finance department.
[552.12] What?
[554.44] Yes,
[555.80] and after today, 
you will work under her.
[561.64] Sure, sir.
[566.20] Now do one thing,
[568.00] introduce her to the staff. Alright?
[570.20] Sir.
[570.88] Okay, that’s your room.
[574.00] Now it is between you 
and your staff.
[576.40] My work here is done.
[578.08] Thank you.
[579.84] Any other order for me.
[581.76] No.
[583.24] Fine, then I will join you.
[584.40] Okay? See you.
[585.40] Sir.
[586.76] Come madam.
[588.84] Madam if you need anything,
[591.20] then call Nawaz.
[593.20] Yes, sure Mr. Nawaz.
[594.32] Today is my first day in the office,
[595.92] so I don’t have an idea 
about things that much.
[598.08] But yes,
[598.88] I want to see the files of the 
ongoing, current projects.
[603.64] Why not? Sure.
[605.48] Great.
[606.28] So, send me the files for the 
projects in my office. I will see.
[610.12] Sure?
[610.64] Thank you.
[615.28] Listen.
[616.00] Yes, boss?
[617.56] Did you hear what madam said?
[619.28] Yes, boss.
[620.44] Go to the room with the files,
 I am coming.
[622.32] Yes, sir.
[625.12] What is this trouble?
[628.24] I will have to inform boss.
[633.28] Wasai.
[635.64] Wasai.
[636.48] Yes? Yes, elder madam.
[639.32] Where is Arooj?
[641.68] I don’t see her.
[643.72] Is she still sleeping?
[648.00] Little madam is not in her room.
[653.56] She went with little
 master to the office.
[657.64] She went to the office?
[660.32] But why did she go?
[662.28] What is going on in this home?
[664.72] Since Arooj has come to this home,
[666.40] everyone is doing what they want.
[668.32] No one can question that Arooj,
[670.24] what is going on?
[671.40] Why did she go to the
 office? What for?
[674.80] Elder madam, I don’t know this.
[680.08] Yes.
[681.44] How will you know
[683.20] when the owners of 
this home don’t know?
[685.80] Little master was saying that
[688.44] from today, from today,
 younger madam
[690.28] will go to the office with me daily.
[704.68] First, she took over Salman,
[709.16] then the home,
[711.76] now she is going to take 
over the business as well.
[716.48] Arooj,
[720.44] I will never let this happen.
[741.96] Boss, be a little alert.
[745.72] What happened, Nawaz?
[748.32] Boss, madam Arooj has taken over
 the charge for the director finance.
[751.76] Does this not seem 
like breaking news for you.
[754.28] What is breaking in this? 
I know.
[757.44] But you don’t know what I
 am going to tell you now.
[763.64] Madam Arooj, has asked for 
all the record of the finance.
[767.40] So?
[768.24] What is to worry in this?
[769.56] You are disturbing me for no reason.
[772.32] Sir, you don’t understand.
[774.92] Sir Salman trusted you blindly
[777.52] and you took advantage of it 
and did corruption of millions.
[780.96] All of it will be caught.
[786.64] You will become a criminal 
in the office and home.
[791.16] Fine, you go. I will think 
of something.
[794.20] Sure, boss.
[833.88] Now this girl will be 
with Salman all the time.
[843.44] When she will stay in
 the office all day long,
[847.52] she will control Salman’s mind.
[856.76] Then Salman will only 
see Arooj all around.
[869.04] What Arooj says will happen.
[875.64] And Salman
[878.64] will continue to agree.
[886.48] I will get lost in such a situation.
[900.52] No, no,
[903.96] this is not possible.
[912.24] I will have to come in the middle.
[934.96] What documents are you showing me?
[937.60] I had asked you to bring me 
the file for the last three months
[942.04] and you are showing me 
the past three years?
[945.04] Keep this with you.
[947.28] Bring the new file.
[968.96] Uncle, what are you looking at?
[974.20] I am seeing my daughter busy in work.
[978.48] But Arooj, why have you
[981.64] gotten yourself involved in this work,
[983.16] files, addition and subtraction?
[986.28] We have a line of managers.
[989.44] Uncle, I was bored sitting at home.
[991.68] Salman said come to the office.
[993.36] I said come on, and I came here.
[999.40] Salman surprises me.
[1002.60] Why? What happened?
[1006.56] This is not the right decision.
[1009.00] I know you came here 
worried from Mehreen.
[1015.88] That’s how mothers-in-law are, child.
[1020.68] Why are mothers-in-law 
not like mothers?
[1023.92] Because they can never 
become mothers.
[1026.60] This is nothing recent, 
it has been there forever.
[1031.00] In fact, there is an unspoken
 competition between
[1033.28] mother and daughters-in-law 
in every country.
[1040.68] Can I give you an advice?
[1042.60] Yes.
[1044.68] When Mehreen’s temperament 
gets fine,
[1047.08] then there can be no better 
place for you than the home.
[1051.16] You were not an 
escapist like this.
[1056.20] No uncle, I have not
 escaped anything.
[1062.84] First Salman wanted
[1064.80] and secondly, 
I have a finance degree.
[1067.76] I thought I am getting
 bored sitting at home,
[1070.00] so why don’t I use
 my education well
[1072.52] and all of you in the 
office get helped too.
[1076.56] Fine, good luck.
[1078.84] Thank you.
[1133.36] Naseema.
[1135.72] Hey, Naseema, where are you?
[1137.88] Yes, coming.
[1144.24] Greetings. You are back.
[1146.76] Greetings. I think I have come.
[1150.80] Wow, Master,
[1152.88] you look really happy today.
[1155.08] Here.
[1156.28] Have sweets and feed me too.
[1159.56] Sweets?
[1161.60] What are these sweets for?
[1163.88] Our Arooj has got a job.
[1168.00] Job?
[1170.56] Why a job?
[1172.80] And she didn’t even tell me that
[1174.96] she was searching for a job.
[1176.76] Why does she need a job?
[1178.92] I don’t know about her need,
[1181.60] but I do know that
[1183.12] what we taught her 
didn’t go to waste.
[1187.48] What are you saying?
[1188.64] I don’t understand.
[1190.88] When she called me,
[1192.72] even I didn’t understand anything.
[1195.12] Then she told me that
[1196.52] she has joined the family 
business with Salman.
[1201.28] Then say that.
[1203.20] Master, you say weird things.
[1207.16] Our Arooj is the owner,
[1209.52] what job?
[1210.76] Yes, we can say that.
[1212.84] But it is a job,
[1214.64] and these sweets are there
[1217.20] because this is the same office
[1219.08] where our Arooj went for a job
[1221.76] and rejected it herself.
[1223.68] Today, she is the owner of that place.
[1230.28] What happened?
[1231.72] What are you thinking?
[1235.12] Job, and Arooj?
[1240.84] That too suddenly.
[1243.52] I am just thinking
[1245.64] why Arooj needs a job?
[1249.12] What if…
[1250.00] Why do you worry?
[1252.96] God makes it all fine.
[1257.20] I am going to get fresh,
[1259.28] you serve these sweets,
[1261.04] and make good tea.
[1262.96] Then we will sit and 
celebrate well.
[1264.88] I will.
[1295.88] Arooj coming to the
 office like this,
[1300.60] and getting involved 
in the system suddenly
[1304.60] seems weird.
[1308.36] I have always worked here 
considering it my company.
[1313.24] Now if it is my company,
[1315.04] so why should I care about two 
to four hundred thousand
[1317.68] here and there?
[1321.48] Now this girl will make it difficult.
[1325.20] Anyway, experience 
is also something.
[1330.76] Boss.
[1334.32] Boss,
[1337.36] what is the matter?
[1338.08] You seem to be lost 
in deep thought.
[1340.56] It feels like you are planning
 something new.
[1342.76] You go from here right now,
[1344.36] I have a bad headache anyway.
[1347.68] I feel madam Arooj has 
given my boss a headache.
[1352.24] Nawaz!
[1354.56] Sorry, boss. Sorry.
[1416.08] Master, come. Have tea.
[1422.92] Give me tea.
[1435.68] What is the matter, Naseema?
[1438.72] Why do I see worry on your face,
 instead of happiness.
[1445.36] You cannot understand 
a mother’s heart.
[1451.88] These doubts of you mothers 
can never be removed that
[1456.12] fathers don’t understand anything.
[1460.76] Actually, the thing is 
my daughter is progressive,
[1465.92] she has been born to 
move forward.
[1470.52] And you tell me,
[1471.72] Naseema, what is the point 
of the education that
[1475.00] you burn in the kitchen.
[1479.12] You are right.
[1481.56] I feel satisfied hearing you talk,
[1488.56] but why suddenly….
[1492.84] Master, there is something.
[1496.28] Mothers always worry.
[1500.12] Our daughter is the owner.
[1505.80] It is possible that Salman wanted
[1509.08] his wife to help him in business.
[1512.68] It is such a small thing.
[1516.40] But I don’t think this is
 only Salman’s wish.
[1525.36] Then do one thing,
[1528.08] invite both of them for dinner.
[1530.44] You ask your questions,
[1533.00] and I will meet my daughter.
[1536.64] Will Salman come?
[1539.12] You know he is really busy 
cause of his business.
[1544.04] Okay, we will meet Arooj,
[1547.00] that’s where our 
real happiness lies.
[1549.56] Here, have sweets.
[1558.64] Then fine, I will call Arooj.
[1561.68] I will go get my mobile.
[1586.64] Who asked you to go 
to the office, Arooj?
[1589.48] I asked her.
[1590.92] I am not talking to you Salman.
[1595.72] Arooj, you tell me.
[1598.64] I went to the office on
 Salman’s instructions.
[1605.40] I understand this cunningness 
of yours well.
[1613.48] You know
[1615.28] I can never ignore anything
 Salman says,
[1617.28] so you always try to 
hide behind him.
[1628.00] I am Salman’s wife, 
so I will hide behind him.
[1634.32] Secondly, I joined the office
[1636.28] because I have done 
my masters in finance.
[1639.48] Several girls do that.
[1641.60] Yes, but all of them 
are not my wives.
[1667.40] I understand.
[1670.92] I understand well that my son
 is getting out of my hands.
[1679.96] So, you loosen your grip.
[1686.16] It is possible that Salman 
won’t slip out of your hands.
[1730.64] Idrees, what is the matter?
[1735.36] You look worried?
[1737.56] Do you think I am worried?
[1741.16] I have spent my life with you,
[1743.80] but I have not seen you worried 
like this ever before.
[1748.60] There is some issue at the office.
[1751.80] That’s it?
[1753.96] If it is an office issue,
[1755.80] then tell Salman, he will solve it.
[1759.52] He created the issue.
[1764.20] What is the issue?
[1767.48] I have not seen you this 
serious before today.
[1770.40] He brought Arooj to 
the office suddenly.
[1772.68] Hey, so what is there 
to worry in this?
[1777.28] It is good that poor 
thing got freed
[1780.00] or else she is under 
Mehreen’s pressure at home.
[1785.00] This is not the solution 
to handle Mehreen,
[1786.76] there can be other ways too.
[1791.40] Why do you have an issue?
[1793.96] Arooj going to the office
[1796.24] will also help Salman.
[1798.88] This is not considered good
 in the business community.
[1804.16] After all, I am not 
in favour of women
[1806.56] at home going to the
 office and working.
[1809.92] You have something 
really narrowminded.
[1816.60] You were never this conservative.
[1819.80] Shaista, you won’t get it.
[1823.32] Then make me understand.
[1825.56] Leave it.
[1860.84] What happened Mehreen?
[1862.08] Is all okay?
[1863.48] Nothing is okay, 
sister-in-law Shaista.
[1865.64] How are you seeing 
all this happen
[1867.48] and you are not 
saying anything?
[1869.04] I don’t understand,
[1870.36] what am I seeing
[1871.28] and what am I not saying?
[1872.72] Do you not see?
[1873.88] Arooj has started 
going to the office.
[1879.32] How can you tolerate 
something so wrong?
[1882.64] If it is wrong, then I will say it.
[1885.00] Okay, so you don’t find 
all of this wrong that
[1888.28] the women of the home 
are taking care of the business.
[1891.56] I didn’t do anything like 
this with Waqar.
[1894.56] You couldn’t do it either.
[1897.16] You are comparing 
me to that Arooj?
[1899.68] You are the one doing the 
comparison, Mehreen.
[1901.96] What do you want?
[1903.64] I want that Arooj doesn’t 
go to the office.
[1906.12] She says all sort of 
things to my Salman.
[1908.56] I take care of her here.
[1910.36] But in the office?
[1911.68] Who will keep an eye 
on her in the office?
[1914.60] He doesn’t understand me.
[1935.68] Arooj.
[1938.16] What is the matter?
[1939.16] What are you thinking?
[1942.60] I am thinking about aunty’s 
behaviour last night.
[1950.32] I am surprised
[1953.20] how she thinks of everything
 so negatively?
[1962.52] Arooj,
[1967.52] don’t misbehave about mom.
[1971.00] What misbehaviour?
[1972.56] I just said I am surprised.
[1974.64] Yes, but this is misbehaviour.
[1977.48] What do you think?
[1979.92] Just because I have started 
to hear everything you say,
[1981.60] then you can misbehave with mom,
[1983.96] and I will not say anything?
[1988.16] Sorry,
[1989.68] this will not happen.
[1990.80] You are taking it wrong,
[1992.28] I said nothing like that.
[1994.20] Look Arooj,
[1996.00] I took you out of the home and
 brought you to the office.
[1998.68] What do you want now?
[2000.20] Should I drop you off
at your parents’ home.
[2005.96] Meaning?
[2006.92] Look, it is clear,
[2009.64] you cannot live with mom,
[2012.04] but I am incomplete without her.
[2014.64] Now you tell me yourself,
[2016.20] what do I do?
[2022.68] Have you ever listened to me earlier,
[2024.16] that you will listen to me now?
[2027.12] Leave it.
[2029.24] Fine,
[2031.16] we will leave it.
[2033.44] But remember one thing,
[2037.80] we have to live with mom.
[2041.04] I shouldn’t hear this in future.
[2046.00] and I have never denied this.
[2051.88] I just want to spend 
a good life with you.
[2060.88] That’s it.
[2105.32] Mehreen’s questions have
 given me a headache.
[2110.32] Still, she is not satisfied 
with even a single answer.
[2114.92] Madam,
[2117.16] I agree that younger madam 
is really educated.
[2120.68] But still,
[2122.08] doing the work at the 
office is really difficult.
[2125.48] Arooj has a degree.
[2128.64] I have full faith in her,
[2131.60] she can do all the work
 at the office well.
[2135.68] If little madam can handle 
the work at the office so well,
[2141.00] then why is elder madam 
so worried?
[2145.64] Wasai, don’t you know?
[2148.00] Mehreen must be fearing that
[2150.56] Arooj will spend all day
 with Salman in the office,
[2155.16] now who will she shoot
 her arrows on?
[2157.84] You are also right, madam.
[2163.56] Mehreen is worried
[2165.88] that Arooj will spend so 
much time with Salman,
[2170.08] what if she controls Salman?
[2173.00] No madam,
[2177.28] all this is about fate.
[2181.08] If staying with someone 
did something,
[2185.28] then I wouldn’t be going 
around aimlessly like this.
[2190.32] Okay Wasai, go and 
make coffee for me.
[2194.16] Sure.
[2261.56] Mr. Nawaz, come to my room.
