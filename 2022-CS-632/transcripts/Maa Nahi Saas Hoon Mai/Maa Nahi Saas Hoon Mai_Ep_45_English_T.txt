[48.20] Salman?
[51.44] Yes mom?
[57.40] Salman,
[59.68] enough of this puppet show,
[65.28] now this show won’t continue 
in this house anymore,
[67.08] that’s it.
[69.92] What do you mean? 
I don’t get it.
[74.08] What didn’t you get?
[75.96] You know everything very well.
[78.56] I don’t know,
[80.08] tell me what are you saying?
[83.08] This show that has been going 
on between Arooj and Ammad,
[89.80] now after that Arooj has no place
 in this house or your life!
[94.56] What do you want, mom?
[97.08] Should I leave Arooj?
[99.32] Yes, absolutely.
[101.28] No, mom.
[107.72] That is not possible.
[109.48] Even after the relationship 
between Arooj and Ammad?
[115.00] You know everything, right?
[118.68] Brother Idrees is here too now.
[122.48] Brother Idrees,
[124.12] you tell me?
[125.52] You know everything too.
[130.04] Arooj and Ammad’s issue.
[135.32] You were the one 
who told me everything.
[142.24] Really?
[144.32] No, I don’t know anything, 
Mehreen,
[146.32] I am sure there is some
 misunderstanding.
[159.48] I don’t know anything.
[162.20] I don’t know. Excuse me.
[230.64] He should have been 
home by now.
[237.88] Where were you?
[239.16] I have been waiting
 for you for so long.
[240.76] Why?
[241.24] Why were you waiting
 for me so desperately?
[244.08] I want to ask you something,
[245.56] tell me,
[246.76] why did Arooj come to office?
[249.88] She can come,
[251.04] she is the part of company
[252.04] and wife of the CEO.
[253.64] But she was in your office.
[256.24] Yes, she must have
 come to get some ...
[258.60] ...suggestion regarding 
some official matter.
[262.00] Suggestion? From you?
[266.92] Doesn’t make sense.
[269.28] You are against Arooj.
[271.92] Yes, that was it,
[273.92] sometimes we make a mistake in ...
[275.64] ...seeing and understanding things,
 in fact,
[276.72] we get misunderstood.
[279.20] Oh, that’s good.
[280.52] At least, you realized 
your mistake.
[283.64] Hmm.
[285.12] Sir Sr, Madam Sr is calling 
you in her room.
[289.96] Hey, I just met her.
[296.68] Yes, she is calling you again.
[299.16] Hmm.
[303.56] Go, now you listen to her,
[306.00] I listen to her all day.
[354.24] Where is this?
[355.32] What difference does it make?
[356.64] What is the importance of it?
[357.44] It is important,
[359.12] it is very important,
[361.12] so that Arooj can 
be questioned
[362.80] that what was she doing 
at this location with Ammad.
[365.24] Where is not important 
in this matter but why is,
[368.08] why are they together?
[369.60] I don’t understand anything.
[371.08] I do,
[372.92] Ammad and Arooj 
are collectively ...
[374.28] planning against 
the company
[375.72] so they can destroy it together.
[383.92] Uncle Idrees did everything 
he could against Arooj,
[392.52] he went against 
Arooj in every way
[394.36] but Arooj was still 
so generous to him.
[404.32] And even Uncle shut himself up,
[411.04] did Arooj make Uncle
 remain quiet by bribing ...
[413.48] ...him against the revelation
 of some secret?
[420.00] No, no,
[422.48] that is not possible.
[426.24] Uncle cannot be that 
weak and greedy.
[432.60] So then what is the matter?
[479.36] Arooj, I want to 
ask you something.
[481.84] Sure, ask.
[485.16] What was the reason that 
made Uncle hate you?
[500.52] Wow,
[502.44] the question that you 
should be asking Uncle,
[504.44] you are asking me instead.
[510.80] I think he would be able to answer 
this question better for you.
[514.16] Yes, but can I at least ask you
 about you doing him this favor all of a sudden?
[525.40] When the wrong has been fixed
[528.64] then what is the 
investigation about?
[531.88] Arooj, I should have 
knowledge about it.
[535.80] Salman, you promised me that
[537.60] you wouldn’t ask me any
 question regarding this.
[545.36] And by the way,
[547.88] there are two types of
 people in this world,
[554.16] good and bad,
[560.92] and whatever you can see,
[563.00] if there is something bad behind it,
[565.68] so yes,
[566.92] you have the right to ask
[570.80] but please
[573.44] right now I can just request you
[576.72] to not ask me any question regarding this, 
it would be better.
[647.44] Pick it up carefully and be careful,
[649.04] nothing should break.
[674.28] Arooj, what is all this?
[678.64] I have shutdown the office.
[683.08] shutdown the office,
[684.20] but why?
[692.68] Because I think it is
 not needed now.
[703.84] I have handed over 
the responsibility
[705.16] of Finance to Uncle 
and Nawaz.
[709.32] Arooj, look, 
whatever happened,
[710.80] you shouldn’t have
 shutdown this office.
[715.64] I did what I had to.
[723.36] And I am sure,
[725.24] whatever decision I have taken
[727.04] will be for the company’s benefit
[734.00] and I don’t need this office
 anymore now anyway.
[739.24] Yes, yes,
[745.92] why would she need 
this office now,
[752.56] when he is not here the one,
[754.20] because of whom she 
was interested in this office.
[922.76] Biscuits, let me check, oh dude,
[928.52] everything had to finish today.
[931.36] What should I do?
[932.44] Let me text Shanzey.
[936.08] Shanzey, I am texting you 
the names of mom’s
[939.12] medicines and her
 favorite biscuits,
[941.64] do bring them when you come.
[946.36] In fact, let me call her.
[953.40] Hello Shanzey?
[955.24] Yes, Ammad?
[956.80] Shanzey, what are you 
doing right now?
[959.48] Can you come to my home?
[961.56] Why? Is everything okay?
[963.56] Yes, actually 
I cannot leave home,
[967.88] mom is very unwell
[970.36] and I have texted you
 the names of mom’s
[972.68] favorite biscuits and medicines,
[975.00] can you bring them?
[978.12] Ammad, what was the need of
[979.88] such prolonged cover
 for such petty thing?
[983.36] I am just bringing them.
[984.56] And Shanzey,
[986.44] I have transferred the
 money to your account.
[989.68] What can I say to you Ammad?
[992.96] Okay, I am coming, okay bye.
[996.04] Bye, umm thank you.
[1002.12] This boy…
[1011.88] Here,
[1013.20] take these files and
[1015.52] keep this laptop in my 
room and keep it safely.
[1018.76] Okay Madam Jr,
[1020.92] shall I ask you something,
 Madam Jr?
[1023.76] Yes.
[1024.68] Why did you shut 
down this office?
[1027.44] It was good it used
 to remain crowded.
[1034.84] you won’t get it.
[1037.80] Keep these things in my room.
[1040.24] Whatever you order.
[1056.84] You never contacted
 after University,
[1059.36] you disappeared 
somewhere.
[1060.72] Madam, you are the 
one who is lost,
[1062.08] how could have 
I contacted?
[1066.12] By the way,
[1067.28] you have achieved 
what you had to,
[1070.28] good.
[1071.28] Hmm,
[1072.48] I achieved it and you?
[1074.96] Won’t you tell me about yourself?
[1077.00] A middle class boy is always
 after making his future,
[1080.68] we don’t even study to study.
[1084.24] College, university, 
we just go there for a good job.
[1088.44] The same old style,
[1090.48] the same revolutionary talks.
[1092.12] Yes, my talks have just been talks,
[1095.64] I couldn’t bring the revolution.
[1097.00] You can’t even bring it.
[1112.96] Arooj, what is all this?
[1115.56] What, Aunt?
[1117.44] Why did you shut down 
your office?
[1122.80] I didn’t shut it down,
[1125.20] I just shifted it to the old place.
[1129.88] Okay,
[1131.28] and tell me,
[1133.40] what has happened?
[1134.72] Idrees has changed completely 
after the meeting.
[1138.08] You have even 
raised his salary?
[1141.24] All of this so suddenly?
[1143.56] Now you will ask me 
the reason behind all this?
[1146.60] Yes, tell me?
[1147.80] I should even know.
[1150.80] According to the agreement,
[1152.08] I cannot disclose 
anything regarding
[1153.32] the meeting outside office,
[1154.72] I am sorry.
[1156.08] Arooj, please.
[1161.20] Okay.
[1179.04] The actual reality…
[1186.08] None of you would be able to hear it,
[1195.12] I have to take care of 
everyone’s heart and
[1202.20] I even have to take care of 
all the relationships.
[1260.80] Mom, take your medicines.
[1263.12] And we have ran out of 2 
of your medicines,
[1266.24] I have asked Shanzey 
she is bringing them.
[1274.60] Who can it be at this time?
[1276.44] It must be Shanzey, son.
[1278.12] You know it very well.
[1279.84] You are waiting so much for her?
[1282.48] Why wouldn’t I?
[1283.96] My daughter is so nice.
[1286.80] I will be right back.
[1304.20] Yes?
[1314.60] Sir Salman, you?
[1317.88] At my home?
[1322.60] Please come in.
[1350.80] Come, please, sir.
[1373.12] It is very small,
[1379.64] it is not lavish like your house but
[1384.52] people live here
[1386.88] who love each other a lot.
[1393.04] Love.
[1400.04] By the way tell me something,
[1407.40] why didn’t you marry yet?
[1410.04] You came here to ask me this?
[1415.32] No.
[1423.80] I have to ask a lot of other things.
[1433.12] Come in, let’s sit and talk.
[1435.64] Please, come in, Sir Salman.
[1440.20] Sir Salman,
[1441.96] this is my mother.
[1444.28] Greetings.
[1445.56] Greetings.
[1447.40] Mom, this is Sir Salman,
[1450.60] where I used to work.
[1452.60] Oh,
[1454.40] so this is your ex-boss,
[1456.52] I mean, was.
[1462.16] Have a seat, son.
[1464.36] Please, come.
[1475.88] I insisted him a lot
[1478.08] that he should resign
[1479.96] but he didn’t listen to
 me even for once,
[1482.24] he said
[1483.64] that the office people 
don’t need me.
[1489.36] I tried to make him understand
 a million times
[1491.84] that you are very talented,
[1494.40] it’s not possible that
[1495.68] the office people don’t need you.
[1498.08] Mom.
[1498.72] Let me finish.
[1505.44] So what was I saying?
[1507.80] I was saying
[1510.32] that I told him
[1511.68] that the people at your office will
 realize your value one day.
[1522.20] And look
[1523.76] now you are here to convince 
my Ammad today.
[1534.44] Mom,
[1536.08] we have guests at home,
[1537.96] please make tea.
[1539.76] Yes, my child,
[1541.00] I’ll just go make it.
[1543.56] No, please let it be, 
it is not needed at all.
[1547.72] You are already unwell, 
so you must rest.
[1554.00] No problem, son,
[1555.48] we rarely get guests at our home
[1558.16] and whenever they do,
[1559.72] we keep them with a lot of love,
[1561.84] hmm?
[1591.76] Pick up the phone, Uncle,
[1594.56] I think
[1596.48] you are getting call from
 two different places.
[1598.80] I will attend it, it is my problem.
[1602.92] By the way,
[1605.04] you keep two numbers, right?
[1608.20] No there is just one number.
[1611.72] Oh ho,
[1613.36] then there must be a lot of 
confusion that you face,
[1618.84] when the first one calls,
[1620.44] you must be taking 
the second one’s name,
[1622.36] and when the second calls,
[1623.80] you must be taking the 
first one’s name.
[1631.84] Are you not going to 
the office, today?
[1633.92] Hmm?
[1635.32] What? What did you say?
[1637.08] I am asking, are you not 
going to the office today?
[1639.20] yes, I don’t feel like it.
[1641.88] Why? Are you feeling well?
[1643.64] Hmm.
[1645.64] I found out that…
[1646.92] What?
[1647.84] What did you find out?
[1648.80] You are panicking like 
I caught your secret.
[1654.04] Anyways,
[1655.28] I found out that
[1657.68] last night Mehreen
[1660.72] asked you to give 
a statement against Arooj
[1662.96] and you didn’t say a word?
[1671.36] How did the tables turn
 all of a sudden?
[1675.60] No, nothing,
[1678.36] I promised you that
[1680.60] Arooj is Salman’s wife
[1682.16] and our daughter in law
[1683.64] so I thought that
[1684.88] if Salman actually loves 
Arooj the I should too.
[1690.56] Thank God,
[1691.56] you understood what I said.
[1696.76] We cannot call Salman our son
[1700.12] or Arooj our daughter in law,
[1702.12] at least we can give them 
love and affection.
[1706.04] Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[1707.28] Okay and…
[1708.04] Yes?
[1710.04] Arooj has left Salman’s office
[1712.40] and she was saying
[1713.48] she would take care 
of the house now.
[1730.92] Corruption of 10 million in 
Sasa builder’s project,
[1736.72] 5 million commission 
in multinet advertising,
[1741.00] very nice.
[1744.52] And the weirdest corruption
[1747.28] that was beyond 
my understanding,
[1749.12] I guess you might
 help me with this,
[1753.64] stone bury’s marble,
[1756.40] it was purchased for Rs64 lac,
[1760.28] but that is not important,
[1762.52] what’s important is,
[1764.48] where did that marble go?
[1771.48] She repented for oppression
 after my murder,
[1779.64] but she destroyed my marital life.
[1788.32] Sir Salman,
[1792.96] tell me why did you come here?
[1799.72] I have never had any direct 
conversation with you.
[1806.16] Mr. Salman,
[1808.76] talk to me openly about 
whatever you are here to say,
[1812.52] there is no one except
 you and I here.
[1819.00] Arooj,
[1824.64] what is the relationship 
between you and Arooj?
[1831.56] Why didn’t you ask 
that question to Arooj,
[1835.36] she would have answered
 it better for you.
[1837.24] She is not answering 
me better
[1844.28] that is why I am asking you.
[1851.44] Answer my question.
[1860.84] Both of you were class fellows,
 right? [00:31:04.10l
[1865.00] Yes, that’s how it is.
[1874.96] And I have heard that
[1878.32] you used to like Arooj.
[1901.24] What happened?
[1902.36] Why is there so much silence?
[1904.04] Nothing mom,
[1905.28] give it to me
[1906.72] and you may go and rest.
[1909.80] My child,
[1910.64] if your heart if at peace,
[1912.52] there will be abundant of rest in life.
[1927.88] Did you hear what mom said?
[1932.28] if your heart if at peace,
[1933.68] there will be abundant of rest in life.
[1939.32] Only if there is peace.
[1950.00] You didn’t answer my question.
[1952.88] Mr Salman, trust me,
[1956.28] this piping hot tea is way more 
important than your question.
[1960.00] Have it
[1966.68] and trust me,
[1970.48] Arooj is a nice girl.
[2004.16] Wasai,
[2005.72] tell me how does this 
change look?
[2009.88] It looks nice, right?
[2013.64] Wasai tell..
[2022.72] Aunt, you?
[2026.76] Oh wow,
[2028.72] you thought of decorating 
home very soon?
[2040.92] I have always heard and
 now I even saw it,
[2051.24] fools return home.
[2057.72] You don’t get it?
[2059.88] It’s very straight,
[2063.08] when that guy left you,
[2064.96] then you remembered my son’s room?
[2067.96] Aunt, please!
[2071.28] Don’t talk about my character,
[2079.80] I know that you really
 like hurting me
[2089.40] because unfortunately, 
you are my mother-in-law.
[2095.00] Unfortunately?
[2096.36] Yes, unfortunately.
[2099.08] Unfortunately,
 you are my mother-in-law,
[2107.08] though I wanted you
 to be my mother.
[2113.04] If I had a daughter like you,
[2115.24] I would have choked her by 
my own hands and killed her.
[2123.08] Mother’s never choke
 their daughters.
[2126.64] The character that you have,
[2129.16] who can leave a 
husband like Salman
[2132.12] and fulfill her old friendships,
[2138.80] should be killed.
[2141.60] Enough! Enough now!
[2146.16] I have done enough
[2149.12] now it is Salman’s turn.
[2156.44] And I know my Salman very well,
[2161.24] he has gone after Ammad.
[2168.04] Just pray, Arooj,
[2170.56] that Salman is not able 
to get hold of Ammad.
