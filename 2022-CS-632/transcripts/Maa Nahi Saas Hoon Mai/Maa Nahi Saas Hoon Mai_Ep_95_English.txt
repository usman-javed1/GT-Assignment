You are the reason behind
Arooj being in this house, you are important even
for Mehreen., that’s why you are
the only one who can take this entire
property from Arooj. But how? With love, attention, passion. Look, son, you have tried to deal
with Arooj with strictness, she will not listen to you
with strictness but if you give her love
and attention, you will be able to control her and Mehreen is in the
same condition. So what do you want? Should I start loving
Arooj and her mother? Don’t, but just pretend to be
the way that they are sure you love
them a lot, they should believe that
you have changed and you cannot live without them, you love both of them a lot and as soon as you
get a chance, just get the sign on
all the documents. Trust me, son, as soon as all the documents
get signed, I will kick both the mother
and daughter out of this house. Hmm, great idea. But do you think
I will be able to do all that? I don’t think, I am sure you will do it. Son, it’s a problem for just a few days, then there will just be happiness, all this would just be ours. Now you understand how you were made the
heir of the entire property ... ...and business after Arooj
went missing? I will go mad. No. You don’t have to get mad, you need to act very sanely. Arooj is a very clever girl, she is also the heir to the
entire business and property. But she is my wife. She is Mehreen’s daughter, now that the reality
is in front of you, don’t expect anything good
from Mehreen as well, and Arooj will stand with her mother
in this situation. But do you know Waqar put everything in
Arooj’s name, Idrees got nothing. Mom, I know all this. Talk about the future. If you know then also know that 4 factories, we have a farmhouse
in Hyderabad, we have 3 more houses
apart from this house and a lot of other things. If Arooj goes away, all this will go with her. Look, Salman, I have no interest in Arooj, and you don’t either, if not today but tomorrow you will have
a second marriage but son, what will happen to us
if we lose all this, just think that. So what do you think she will give all this
to us easily? Not to us, to you. I have a plan. Come here, sit down. I and Idrees have given Salman greed for the money and property but he is not such a person. He is very egoistic and obstinate, he can change his decision
at any given point. I and Idrees will have
to be very careful, we have to take it out
of Salman’s mind that all this belongs to Arooj. If Salman won’t support
what’s wrong, our plan can go sideways. No, no, I won’t give up that easily, I have worked hard for it for years, only what I want is
going to happen. I am stuck in a weird
confusion. What happened? You know it. What happened right now,
my friend? I don’t know, dude, I am getting irritated
by everyone, I feel everyone is the
reason for my destruction. Salman, the same CD is
stuck in your mind though you have already discussed
this issue with me. Yes, by the way, you are right, what do I have to do with
Arooj and her property? So that’s the thing, I get it. Mom and Dad say that
all of this is mine, which is wrong. You know that better than
me, Salman and as far as fair dealing
is concerned, the whole business community
gives your example. Dude, but I won’t be able to do this. Salman, do you know, I have always learned
one thing from you, just follow that. What things? Let the matter go. Whenever there
will come a point that you will have to make
some decisions, you can tell me and if you don’t tell me that thing, I will get it. I have decided, I will divorce Arooj. Your decision is absolutely right. This is what should
happen to Arooj, she deserves it. I agree with your decision,
son. But you will not divorce
Arooj right now. Just wait for a while. Why? Why should I wait? I hate her. I know but do you know that Waqar had put everything
in Arooj’s name, Idrees didn’t get anything. We won’t go away from here. And why should we go? So? what will we do? Don’t you remember what you said to me? This house, property, business, all this is mine, so when everything
belongs to us, why should we leave? These people won’t
let us live here. How wouldn’t they? Doing that is not in their control. Nothing like that will happen. Yes, you are right. But there is just one problem. Uncle, Aunt, and Salman have
captured everything. Did you call me? Yes, Arooj, I thought a lot about it, brother Idrees and
sister-in-law Shaista, when you were born, they used to hate you
ever since your birth. But what did I do to them
at that time? I and Waqar didn’t
have a child, then you came into this world, which means, the heir of
Waqar’s all the belongings. Waqar put all his belongings
in your name, ever since then,
they hate you, they are your enemies. If Dad put everything
in my name, there must be some
agreement or a stamp paper or
something that was signed. Yes, papers were there, they were definitely there, they must be kept somewhere, let me check. Madam Jr, don’t worry, you just don’t worry, Why? because Sir Sr and Begum Sahiba are very greedy people, yes, everything in this
house belongs to you, they won’t ever let you
go off their hands. I thought I would tell
you myself but you promised me that you would help me find
my parents. Forgive it as my mistake How can you be such
stone-hearted? She loves you so much, do you know she hasn’t slept for the
past two nights, she… So what should I do? I am not responsible
for feeling pity on anyone. Salman, she is not someone, she has given you love
for the past 25 years, she is your mother
and you, you are calling her
Aunt Mehreen today? Do you feel peaceful? Very much. Do you know, Mom, when I come to you, I forget all my problems. After all my son is my life. My son is my soul. I wasn’t your son, but all your control and wishes were from me. This perfume, this is your favorite, right? So then, fine, that is what I will put. My plan will become easier if I apply this. Sir Jr, did you call me? I am sorry, Wasai. Don’t worry, I spoke to you strictly last night and I am embarrassed for that. No, no, Sir Jr, that is not needed, you are the owner of this house and I am just a maid. I never considered you as
a maid of this house, I didn’t even treat my mother
and wife nicely. Okay, tell me, where is Arooj? She is in that room. What do you mean by that room? Umm.. In Aunt Mehreen’s room? So just call her Madam Sr, she is yours in fact, she is the Madam Sr of this house. Okay, I will go meet her, in fact, I also have to apologize to her. You may go, I am coming. Okay Sir Jr. You are the reason behind
Arooj being in this house, you are important even
for Mehreen., that’s why you are
the only one who can take this entire
property from Arooj. But how? With love, attention, passion. Look, son, you have tried to deal
with Arooj with strictness, she will not listen to you
with strictness but if you give her love
and attention, you will be able to control her and Mehreen is in the
same condition. So what do you want? Should I start loving Arooj
and her mother? Don’t, but just pretend to be the way that they are sure
you love them a lot, they should believe that you have changed and you cannot live without them, you love both of them a lot and as soon as you get a chance, just get sign on all
the documents. Trust me, son, as soon as all the documents
get signed, I will kick both the mother
and daughter out of this house. Hmm, great idea. But do you think
I will be able to do all that? I don’t think, I am sure you will do it. Son, it’s a problem for just
a few days, then there will just be happiness, all this would just be ours. Good acting, Salman, very good acting. where did the documents go? I kept them here somewhere. Where did I keep them, why can’t I find them? Why are you tiring yourself? We will find it some other time, and anyway… Anyway what? You are extremely foolish. Let me get the proof of your
ownership once and see how they bow down
in front of you. Can’t we treat someone nicely and make them ours? We can, Arooj but at least there is no
hope from them. where are they kept? They are definitely
kept somewhere. I will go and check the
cupboard once again. Mom’s condition is very bad,
Wasai. She is suffering from
intense mental stress. The one who has ruled
all her life and now all this, it is not tolerated. Did Salman misbehave
a lot with Mom? She has never been sad
about anyone except Sir Jr. It has been so many years, I have only seen this. How would thinking help,
Madam Jr?
