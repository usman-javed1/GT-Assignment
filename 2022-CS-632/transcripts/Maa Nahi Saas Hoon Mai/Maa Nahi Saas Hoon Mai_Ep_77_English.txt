Today, elder madam is loving 
Areej in a way that she used to play with you
twenty five years back. Mama longs for love. No one loved her. And even if she loved someone, then that is only Salman. Who is not even her son. You are right. But younger madam, I don’t know why I feel that elder madam will remember
 everything soon. But those people also seem 
in a lot of hurry. Yes, you are right. I too feel the same. Since aunt has found out that I am the daughter 
of this home, Areej, the owner of this entire property, 
this wealth, since then she has started
 to hate me. But maybe she doesn’t know that I have found out all this. And now I feel I will have to inform her about this. No, no, younger madam. There is no need for that. There is a need, Wasai. Now I will have to show the 
true picture to aunt. So that she stay in her limit, so that my family stays protected 
from her jealousy and envy. God, make younger madam’s 
difficulties easy. Come in. How did you think of coming 
to my room today? You are always found in your 
mother in law’s room. She is not my mother in law, 
she is my mother. You know this and I have also found out 
about this. So? Now, quickly go and inform 
Salman and Mehreen. Go. Hah, yes, I will surely tell them. But when the time comes. In fact, I will inform the entire city. But right now there is something that I especially want to tell you. That is, money is not everything, a person is important, relations are respectable, feelings are important. You came to give me this lecture? 
Huh? No. I just came to see if you 
find these important or you just consider them a lecture. Leave from here. Go. I am going. And yes, one last thing. I am the owner of this business,
property and wealth, and I have found out 
about this really well. So my advice is, stop dreaming about it. It is just a matter of me 
going to the court. I will ruin the game you planned 
for twenty five years in minutes. So, the result of everything 
I have said is that, stay away from the life of my husband,
my mother and my daughter. This is better for you. Idrees, why do you look so worried. What happened? 
You had gone to the lawyer. What did he tell you? 
What did he say? Everything is ruined. 
Everything is upside down. What do you mean?
 What happened? Waqar put his entire property 
and business in Areej’s name. Yes, all of us know that. Waqar died,  Areej got lost. So I got the legal right, 
so I gave Salman all the rights. Idrees, we know all this. What has happened now? 
Tell me. Now the real owner of the business 
and property is here. She will take her right from us. How will she take it like that? If we don’t give it, 
she will take it legally. She has a strong case. 
She is Waqar’s daughter. What is this problem? 
What will we do now? Now you will not do anything, I will do whatever needs to be done. Mussarat, how can I forget you 
and the children? I am just busy, I will visit. Yes. Okay listen, I am getting a call,
I will call you later. Yes, go ahead, Shaista,
 what is the matter? Arooj came to show her right. Huh? What right? She wants to take over the entire
business and property. She threatened me with the court. That’s it, Idrees, I am telling you, this entire property and business 
is going to get out of our hands. Nothing will go anywhere. What will we do now? Exactly, what I had thought. The last solution., Now I feel I will have to 
implement that. Fine. Did you see? Did you see how this magician 
taking over the entire environment. Yes, I see it. You are only seeing it, 
but you are not doing anything. Shaista, we cannot bang 
our head on the wall for no reason and call it an attempt. We will have to make plans 
to break down the wall. No Idrees, you listen to me carefully. We will never agree that
 she is Waqar’s daughter. We will say she is a fraud. She is lying to take over 
the wealth and business. What are you saying, Shaista, nowadays, you find out immediately
through DNA testing. I don’t know what 
all you are thinking. She is not my mother in law, she is my mother. You know this and I have 
also found out about this. So? Now, quickly go and inform 
Salman and Mehreen. Go. Hah, yes, I will surely tell them. But when the time comes. In fact, I will inform the entire city. But right now there is something that I especially want to tell you. That is, money is not everything, a person is important, relations are respectable, feelings are important. I am the owner of this business, 
property and wealth, and I have found out 
about this really well. So my advice is, stop dreaming about it. It is just a matter of me going 
to the court. I will ruin the game you planned 
for twenty five years in minutes. So, the result of everything 
I have said is that, stay away from the life of my husband,
my mother and my daughter. This is better for you. The last solution. Now I feel I will have 
to implement that. Last solution? What is going on in Idrees’ head? What has he thought of? Greetings, sir. Greetings. Tell me, sir. 
What do you want? You have to do something
 important, but you have to do it 
in a clean manner. Sir, we do everything 
in a clean manner, but tell me, who do you want 
removed from your path? There is a girl, 
her picture is in this. Here you go. Rest, after the work is done. It will be done, sir. But when do we have to do it? I will tell you that. Wait for my call and always be ready. And don’t give them a chance. 
You won’t get this opportunity again. Don’t worry, sir. Your work will be done. I will go now. Driver, come on. Little baby, Areej. Little love. She has small hands. Yes, Salman? Mom, I wanted permission 
from you. Permission for what? I want to take Arooj for dinner. Yes, fine, go. Listen. There are a few things 
for my lovely Areej, I will message you,
do bring them. Sure. See, papa is going. Papa is going with mama. Say goodbye to papa. Okay, you take care of yourself. Yes. Say bye, 
bye to papa. Bye. Bye. 
Goodbye. Now if we are going out, 
then fix your mood. I am just going because of you, or else I was not in the mood. Arooj, we will go out, 
have a good dinner, we will shop, 
your mood will be fine. No one can say anything
in front of your insistence. Come on. The car is leaving just now. But remember, just the girl. The boy shouldn’t even get a scratch. Understand? Okay. Oh wow, you kept on calling me stupid and you are planning 
all this yourself? This is correct. If you had to do this, then you should have waited a little. You should have done it 
when Arooj was alone. We don’t have time to wait. But even Salman can get 
affected by this. Nothing will happen. He is an expert shooter, 
nothing will happen. Still, there is no room of mistake
in such things, you are taking a big risk. Look, we have to take a risk and you be patient, everything 
is going according to plan. Everything will be fine. Is everything fine, son, Salman? Uncle, what is all this? I was going through some old documents
 and these are some property files, they are all in Areej’s name.
 Who is she? I had told you, 
that Mehreen liked the name… How can all this happen 
on liking a name? And we don’t know about this. Son, actually, I have no idea of this. Late Waqar used to handle everything. Whatever he used to do would be final, I never even questioned him. If you ask me the truth, 
I had never even thought that I would have to live 
without my brother and take care of this 
entire business. Shaista, what would you know. No risk, no gain. Master, this is the place, right? You just keep the bike ready, and turn it around, got it? Fine. 
I will just come. Come on. Come on, 
start the bike. Oh, Salman. Salman, you are bleeding. Are you fine? I am fine, come on.
Come to the hospital. Come on. Who were they?
Leave everyone. You are bleeding. Be quick. Come on. Careful. Salman, are you fine? Arooj, drive slowly. I am driving fine. Arooj, I am absolutely fine, 
why are you worried? You are bleeding. It is necessary for us 
to reach the hospital. You are fine, this is enough for me. You are mad. Does it hurt? 
We are going to reach soon. Yes? Is the work done? Sir we took the aim from close, 
but… What if and but? 
What happened? The girl moved from the target 
at the last moment and she didn’t get shot.
