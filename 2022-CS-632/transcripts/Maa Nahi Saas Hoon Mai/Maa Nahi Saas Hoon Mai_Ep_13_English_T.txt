[23.53] What should I do?
[27.10] It wouldn’t look nice like this.
[31.37] Madam Sr, shall I get tea for you?
[35.27] No, I don’t need anything,
[37.37] I don’t need anything right now.
[39.60] You look a bit worried.
[42.27] Is everything okay?
[44.53] I am unable to find it.
[45.87] I have looked for it everywhere.
[47.77] I am afraid Salman’s 
mood might get off.
[50.80] what are you unable to find?
[52.40] Wasai, I cannot find a gift wrap.
[55.37] Gift wrap?
[57.10] Wasai,
[58.47] I cannot find a gift
 paper to pack.
[61.37] Okay, okay,
[63.00] if you want, I can get it 
packed from the market?
[66.43] Are you mad, Wasai?
[68.17] What if you lose it?
[70.67] Yes, you are right.
[75.03] Okay, don’t worry,
[77.33] let me do something.
[81.80] Right?
[83.33] We will pack it well
[84.93] for Salman, okay?
[94.87] If I go that soon,
[97.70] Madam Sr will have a doubt,
[102.30] I will go in a while.
[113.00] Where is Wasai?
[114.63] Just pray that we find it.
[121.77] What happened Wasai?
[122.97] Did you find the paper?
[124.83] Here, Madam Sr,
[127.33] I have found it with so 
much difficulty for you.
[130.43] Wasai, stay happy and stay blessed.
[132.30] Thank you so much.
[134.37] Okay do you need something else?
[137.00] No, I don’t need anything, just go.
[138.73] Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[141.03] Okay.
[143.20] You have done wonders today.
[148.23] Keep this.
[152.10] What is this for, madam Sr?
[155.07] It is your gift,
[156.90] you have done wonders today,
[159.00] you have made me happy.
[160.23] thank you...
[165.60] Let me pack it real quick.
[169.60] My Salman will be so happy 
today, just wait and watch.
[174.23] This is nice,
[175.67] let’s pack in this,
[176.57] by the way this is also good.
[178.00] Hmm.
[186.33] Wasai? What happened?
[188.53] Did you give the things to her?
[192.97] Why are you quiet? 
What happened?
[195.57] Tell me?
[206.30] Good job, Wasai, you scared me,
[210.03] thank you so much.
[211.50] Is it ever possible that
[213.23] my madam asked me 
to do some work
[215.77] and I won’t do it?
[218.33] Thank you.
[237.47] Happy Birthday to you.
[241.27] Thank you.
[241.80] Happy Birthday to you.
[246.07] Happy Birthday Dera Salman.
[250.90] Happy Birthday to you.
[259.17] Thank you so much, everyone.
[263.43] Thank you, mom,
[265.20] you know what?
[266.97] You are the best 
mother in the world.
[270.07] Thank you.
[278.23] Have it.
[299.07] Your turn, uncle.
[304.40] Thank you so much, everyone,
[306.47] really means a lot.
[308.40] Here, your gift.
[320.70] Mom, what is this?
[322.43] Open it and look at it yourself.
[353.27] How did you like it?
[360.53] Mom, this is…
[361.87] This is very cute, aunt.
[364.27] You have given such a 
nice present to Salman.
[368.73] Salman, do you know
[370.43] this gift is from your first Birthday.
[375.23] Thank you again, mom.
[377.73] Love you.
[383.90] Thank you so much.
[396.47] Thank you.
[447.77] What happened?
[451.13] You feel so much love 
for me today?
[459.60] You are my choice,
[464.80] I left the entire world and 
chose you for myself,
[470.83] I am proud of my choice.
[482.53] What have I done?
[487.10] You know it.
[493.50] Really?
[496.50] Do you know
[500.77] I have seen a competition in 
this house since childhood?
[504.17] What competition?
[509.03] Mom loves me a lot
[512.33] and Aunt gives me a lot of 
attention as compared to Mom
[517.33] because of which Mom
 is always irritated by Aunt.
[525.80] So?
[528.27] What is there to get 
so serious about?
[533.13] You are the only son 
of this house,
[535.03] that might be the only reason.
[540.63] Do you know something?
[545.17] What?
[548.73] You haven’t just won 
Mom’s heart today,
[552.43] but mine as well.
[569.47] You liked it?
[585.90] I liked it a lot.
[591.93] I am glad.
[594.40] Thank you so much.
[630.00] Thank you, mom,
[631.83] you know what?
[633.60] You are the best mother
 in the world.
[636.27] Love you.
[642.53] Thank you so much.
[653.33] My Salman was so happy,
[659.00] I was completely sure that
[663.33] he would love the gift I gave him
[675.53] and why wouldn’t he like it?
[679.83] I, his mother has given it to 
him with so much love,
[689.80] and that Urooj,
[695.57] what did she think by 
giving a cheap watch?
[703.00] She thought she
 could win from me?
[709.87] She was mistaken,
[714.83] my son, my Salman is just mine,
[720.67] just mine.
[746.90] Salman, Oh God! Mercy.
[749.00] What happened to my son?
[749.97] Are you okay?
[751.60] Salman is not your son, 
he is my son.
[760.40] Salman, did you get hurt?
 Are you okay?
[764.17] I am fine mom.
[765.90] Thank God.
[769.80] You don’t have to worry so much 
about Salman, sister-in-law,
[775.37] enough, for God’s sake.
[779.57] What did I say wrong?
[781.30] I have just called him my son.
[783.07] It is wrong for someone else to 
call Salman their son except me.
[785.93] for God’s sake please!
[788.43] Enough!
[790.67] Both of you are always 
arguing about me.
[798.67] Salman?
[799.27] mom, please!
[800.87] I am already so late,
[802.20] I have to go.
[811.93] Did you see?
[813.03] You spoiled his mood,
[814.93] he is my son, I know it very
 well how to treat him.
[818.03] Now he left the house angrily.
[903.40] What is it Urooj?
[904.83] Hello? Salman?
[908.43] Are you okay?
[913.00] Look what had to happen,
 it did,
[915.57] there is no use of taking 
it so much on your brain.
[918.33] How should I not take 
it hard on me?
[920.27] Is this a way?
[921.70] Okay, please relax,
[924.17] why are you getting angry?
[926.10] You are going to the office, 
you have so much work,
[929.60] okay you must drive
[931.80] and call me as soon as you 
reach to the office, okay?
[935.23] Don’t worry.
[937.73] Bye.
[939.27] Bye.
[971.33] Yes mom, what is it?
[973.10] Salman, my love, where are you?
[983.50] where would I be?
[984.70] I am going to the office,
[986.07] please do not disturb me.
[987.97] Why would I disturb you?
[990.17] I just called to say that
[992.70] there is no need to get angry
[994.60] and whatever sister-in-law 
Shaista has said,
[996.60] just forget about it.
[998.47] But you guys won’t let me forget it.
[1004.87] And please for God’s sake,
[1006.67] stop fighting for me.
[1008.50] Sister-in-law Shaista 
must think that,
[1011.13] I am your mother my child
[1013.57] and everyone should 
know that anyway.
[1017.30] Mom, everyone knows it,
[1018.93] everyone knows 
you are my mother.
[1021.03] Why are you guys so adamant 
on making my life hell?
[1023.47] God forbid, anything 
happens to you,
[1025.37] may you get my life as well.
[1028.00] So then for God’s sake, please!
[1030.20] Leave me alone!
[1038.97] Salman? Salman?
[1040.67] What is this sound?
[1042.37] Hello? Salman, 
say something Sal…
[1044.43] Hello? Salman, 
what happened?
[1047.67] Why don’t you say something?
[1049.13] Hello?
[1050.43] Give it to me.
[1052.07] Hello, my child, Salman?
[1054.23] Why don’t you say anything?
[1055.60] What happened?
[1056.83] Salman?
[1156.37] Where is my son?
[1157.13] What happened? How is he?
[1158.13] Nothing will happen to Salman, 
God will have mercy.
[1159.67] Nothing will happen.
[1160.53] My son, where is Salman?
[1162.57] Nothing should happen
 to my son, brother,
[1164.43] nothing should happen.
[1165.23] nothing will happen to Salman,
[1166.53] just pray for him.
[1167.40] Shaista, just stay strong,
[1169.37] God will have his mercy on him.
[1170.73] Everything will be fine.
[1179.17] Have courage, my child,
[1181.63] you need to stay strong
[1182.73] else it will get difficult 
to control them.
[1189.20] Everything will be fine, 
Mehreen, don’t worry,
[1191.07] everything will be fine.
[1197.77] Come, come, come here,
[1200.40] my child. Come. Come.
[1210.33] Oh God, have mercy,
[1212.30] keep my child in your protection,
[1215.53] who gave evil to my son, oh God.
[1218.70] Oh God.
[1248.90] Doctor?
[1249.43] Doctor, how is Salman now?
[1251.93] Patient is out of danger now.
[1255.60] There is no need to worry
[1257.00] but you have to arrange blood, O+
[1260.83] Take my blood.
[1264.50] Your blood group is O+?
[1266.33] I am the mothe…
[1270.00] I am Salman’s mother,
[1271.57] my son will get my blood.
[1273.80] Nurse.
[1275.63] Hmm.
[1357.20] Wasai, you?
[1359.27] Greetings, Madam Jr.
[1361.70] Greetings.
[1364.17] When did you come?
[1366.70] Just right now,
[1369.53] I couldn’t resist.
[1373.30] My heart was towards 
the hospital only.
[1377.00] I was getting very strange
 thoughts in my mind,
[1381.60] so I immediately came here.
[1386.83] Salman is very lucky that
[1390.83] Aunt Shaista, Aunt Mehreen,
[1394.73] everyone loves him a lot.
[1397.50] And you love him so much too.
[1400.33] Sir Jr has played in my lap.
[1409.13] But Wasai,
[1411.90] I don’t understand one thing that
[1415.90] why is there this race of love for Salman 
between Aunt Shaista and Aunt Mehreen?
[1424.60] What is the reason?
[1429.57] Actually, the thing is
[1431.93] Sir Jr is the only child of this house,
[1435.93] Madam Sr loves him,
[1439.47] the other madam loves him a lot too.
[1444.07] I guess because
[1447.07] she doesn’t have 
any children of her own.
[1449.57] yes, you got it absolutely right.
[1452.87] Now look,
[1454.50] I love Sir Jr so much too,
[1458.70] I don’t even have any child,
[1461.90] I cannot even say that
[1464.40] Sir Jr is like my own child
[1469.43] because I am a maid.
[1472.30] Wasai?
[1473.83] Why do you think like that?
[1476.70] Everyone respects you 
so much in the house.
[1482.17] Stay blessed Madam Jr.
[1484.93] Come I will take 
you where everyone is.
[1487.27] Yes.
[1498.83] what was the need
 for you to say this?
[1501.63] if you would have spilled 
the tea that
[1503.93] you are his mother there 
would have been a problem.
[1506.33] You are the limit,
[1508.57] one problem doesn’t get solved
[1510.60] and you prepare to 
create another one.
[1513.27] Our hard work of all these 
years will go to waste.
[1517.33] Okay,
[1519.70] I will stay quiet,
[1522.93] let her give the blood.
[1525.40] You can fulfill your wish 
if her blood group doesn’t match.
[1532.70] Let me tell you something, Idrees,
[1535.57] it wouldn’t make any 
difference if we stay quiet,
[1539.77] he is our blood
[1545.50] and blood definitely speaks.
[1550.07] You don’t have to worry,
[1552.07] I have called the blood bank,
[1553.60] they have arranged the blood.
[1558.50] None of you will have
 to give the blood.
[1565.07] I will be right back.
[1597.43] Is Salman okay?
[1598.87] yes, Salman is absolutely fine.
[1602.33] You will see,
[1603.10] if he gets my blood,
[1604.53] he will get fine by tonight 
and come home.
[1606.50] Mehreen, actually 
that is not needed,
[1609.47] doctor has said since 
you are aged
[1611.60] so you shouldn’t give the blood.
[1613.07] He is my son,
[1614.13] he will get my blood, 
I have just said it.
[1616.40] Mehreen, Mehreen,
[1618.00] it is not good for your health.
[1619.87] God forbid, if something 
happens to you,
[1621.57] what will happen to Salman?
[1622.93] nothing will happen to me.
[1624.10] Look, don’t be stubborn,
[1625.50] it is like being selfish,
[1627.27] I know you love Salman a lot
[1629.70] but the blood has been arranged,
 the doctor has said.
[1632.57] Okay? Sit down.
[1684.77] Salman?
[1686.90] Salman? My child. Is he okay?
[1695.97] Oh god! Thank God, my son is fine.
[1698.83] Easy, sister-in-law Shaista,
[1700.23] can’t you see he is sleeping 
and he is been injured.
[1712.80] You will see
[1714.30] my son will get absolutely fine,
[1716.60] I have prayed a lot for
 my son’s long life.
[1720.07] How is it possible that
[1721.83] God doesn’t answer
 a mother’s prayers?
[1762.90] Mom? Mom.
[1768.27] Urooj, is everything okay?
[1773.93] Why are you crying, my child?
[1776.70] Everything is fine, mom,
[1779.37] I just felt like hugging and 
crying someone of my own.
[1785.23] My child, have patience
 and courage,
[1788.30] all this is a test from God,
[1791.60] can I meet Salman?
[1793.67] No, no, dad, not right now.
[1797.00] Is there anything to 
worry about, Urooj?
[1800.27] No, mom, thank God,
[1802.57] he just had a minor
 injury on his head,
[1804.37] doctor has said that there’s 
nothing to worry about,
[1807.50] he will be well soon.
[1809.37] If God wills.
[1810.63] Don’t worry,
[1811.87] God will make things well.
[1813.57] Amen.
[1815.37] Both of you come 
sit here meanwhile.
[1817.43] I will make you meet 
Salman then.
[1818.97] Okay, my child.
[1833.47] Greetings.
[1834.70] Greetings.
[1836.27] How are you?
[1838.37] yes, I am absolutely fine.
[1840.67] Salman will be absolutely fine,
[1843.37] don’t worry.
[1845.23] Yes, I know Salman 
will be absolutely fine,
[1848.10] after all he has his 
mother’s prayers with him.
[1851.50] Indeed, a mother’s 
prayers are very powerful.
[1855.63] Yes.
[1857.27] A mother’s prayers 
act like a wall
[1860.20] in front of the curse 
sent by someone.
[1864.07] There is no curse, 
sister Mehreen,
[1866.90] it was just a mere coincidence.
[1870.10] Sister Naseema,
[1871.43] I am so worried right now so
[1873.63] I don’t want to get into all this.
[1876.87] yes.
[1901.23] I think we don’t have 
to stay here now,
[1903.70] they will discharge 
Salman in the morning.
[1906.67] So, who will stay 
with Salman tonight?
[1910.47] Umm,
[1911.70] Urooj must definitely 
stay and Mehreen.
[1916.77] Why Mehreen? Why not me?
[1920.10] What will you do here?
[1921.57] So, what will Mehreen do?
[1923.57] What nonsense? 
Is the time to compete?
[1926.67] it is not about competition,
[1928.17] he is my son,
[1930.00] how can I just leave 
him here and leave?
[1932.50] This is a hospital,
[1933.77] it is not appropriate for 
a lot of people to stay here.
[1938.07] So, then you must take 
Mehreen home.
[1940.50] Why do you say 
the same thing again that
[1943.27] you even have an answer to?
[1945.63] Mehreen will not go from here.
[1948.10] Then I won’t go as well.
[1952.13] Okay, I am leaving,
[1954.47] call me in case of any problem.
[2008.73] Mom.
[2017.57] yes, my child?
[2019.83] How is my son?
[2029.93] My love.
[2122.43] Aunt Mehreen’s behavior
[2129.90] is very rude with Aunt Shaista
[2137.03] but Aunt Shaista still 
loves Salman so much,
[2146.97] she doesn’t care about Aunt 
Mehreen’s rude behavior at all.
[2157.63] Salman is very lucky that
[2165.43] he gets so much love from both of them.
[2236.27] She was trying to stay 
awake for no reason
[2239.43] to prove her love for Salman.
[2245.70] I am his mother,
[2247.00] I couldn’t even sleep for a moment.
