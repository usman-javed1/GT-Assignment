They are not my guests. They are uncle’s guests. Aunt, meet her, she too is my aunt. Uncle’s second wife. Mussarat Idrees Ahmad. My friend’s father told me. He told me that there is a family who had lost their daughter twenty four 
to twenty five years back. I feel you can be that daughter. And? What else did they tell you? 
Speak up. Where was she born? 
Who are those people? What was her name? They must have told you 
something more too. I don’t know all this, we can find out 
when we meet them. Yes, so when will we meet them? We are going to meet them 
tomorrow in the morning. Morning? We will meet them in the morning? Salman, why can we not meet
 them right now? Are you going to the office? And where is Arooj going, 
dressed up? Yes, I had some work out of city,
 so I thought I would pick Arooj, she too will have an outing. Okay, then I too will come along 
with you people. I have not been on 
an outing for long. Mehreen, you surprise me. We are not of the age 
to go for outings. If the children feel like going, 
then let them go. But sister-in-law, Shaista… Mehreen, please. You people go ahead children. 
Enjoy. Go. Goodbye. Goodbye.  
Goodbye. I had told you 
I would tell you myself, but you had promised me that you will help me in finding
 my parents. Forgive me, thinking it was 
my mistake. How can you be so stone hearted? She loves you so much. You know, she has not slept 
for two nights. So, what do I do? I have not taken up the responsibility 
of showing mercy on someone. Salman. She is not someone. She has loved you for 
twenty five years. She is your mother, and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen. What? What is this drama, Arooj? You are in no position to ask 
any questions, uncle. Right now, you let aunt and aunt 
talk with each other, okay? Mama, it was time for our breakfast, right? But the drama is so good, that we will have breakfast later.
What do you think? So, Mr. Idrees, is this your Islamabad. You are living here in Karachi, and I am ruined here in this city. Idrees, who is this woman? I am asking you, who is she and what nonsense is
 she speaking? Idrees has no other lie 
to speak now. I will tell you. I am Idrees’ wife. And we have been married 
for fourteen years. Fourteen years? Idrees, what is she saying? Answer me. She is talking about marriage. Hey, I don’t know this woman 
and who she is. Really? Then you wouldn’t even 
recognize your son and you wouldn’t recognize 
this ring either. Hey, stop it. 
You are constantly talking. Do you not care about 
right or wrong. Shaista, I don’t know 
what she is saying. I don’t know. I will lie about such a big thing? Okay enough. 
One second. One second. This allegation that 
you are putting, do you have any proof of this? Proof? Mama, Areej is crying. Yes, I will go and check. Wasai, bring two cups of tea to the room. Sure. Yes, so tell me, do you have proof, that whatever you are saying
is true. Why are you quiet? Speak up. The only proof a woman has
is her wedding. Our wedding is proof of this, and I have the wedding papers. What did you do, Arooj? What did I do, mama? Don’t act naïve, Arooj. I am talking about brother Idree’s 
second wife. I just wanted to get 
a woman her right, that’s why I did all this. You did good, Arooj. This woman should surely 
get her right. But you just didn’t do this much, Arooj. You have guessed it right, mama. But it was necessary to do this, because uncle Idrees was not from
 amongst those who would learn. What did brother Idrees do? Tell me Arooj. If someone has given pain 
to my daughter, then I will fix him myself. Mama, you, Salman and Areej, you are my complete world. But uncle and aunt want to take out Salman from 
this complete world of mine, and make everything incomplete. I am like you. Like you show your right on relations, just like that I too want that the relations attached to me, 
just stay attached to me. I know sister-in-law, Shaista well. She is a really conspiring 
and envious woman. Honestly, Arooj, you are someone who keeps 
the home together. But, Arooj, whatever is happening there, 
what will be the result of that? Only God knows this. But right now we will be 
safe from them. You are right. You are absolutely right. Did you not have shame keeping 
relations with a married man? Not relation, marriage. You are lying. You have put a crack in my home. I didn’t know. Idrees told me that 
he divorced his wife, he is single. And you believed him? If a man cries and asks 
a woman for sympathy, then the woman becomes helpless. I thought there is a man troubled 
by circumstances, a worn-out person, 
who needs support. What? He is still left to be worn-out. First, let me deal with the other 
deceivers in the home. You… from where did you come 
in the home? Get out. No. No. Idrees. 
Come on, get out. Come on. Idrees, I won’t go. Idrees. No. 
Come on. Come on. Leave me. 
Come on, go out. Stop mama, you don’t need to go anywhere. It is their own issue, they will sort it out 
amongst themselves. You will not go between 
these people at all. Idrees, leave me. 
Come on. Idrees, leave me. 
Leave me. Listen to me, I am still telling you 
to go from here. Where do I go? The same home I bought for you, 
where else? I will come meet you. I am present here, 
meet me over here. Why are you insisting? 
We are living a good life. We? Not we. Only you and 
your first wife. I have been put on the side. I am telling you I will fix everything.
Believe me. Enough. 
That’s it, Idrees. I don’t believe your lies 
and false promises. I want respect of our relation 
in the society. Hey, so you announced it. 
Stop it. Leave now. Why should I go? I will not go from here.
I am your wife and I want the right of being your wife. Wife? Will you live your life quietly or else,
you will suffer all your life. You will not be able to prove that
we have been married. I doubted your actions earlier, but I thought that no, you are unable to take out time 
because of being busy at work. But when you ignored our son, that’s when I was sure that something is surely wrong.
For this day, I had already taken out 
our wedding papers. Look, you are not understanding. You are listening to that Arooj.
She is using you, so that she can take away 
all the wealth. Don’t you want that me, you 
and our child live a happy life. You want it or not? You want it, right? Yes, go from here. 
No one will go anywhere. I was telling her to leave from here. She should leave immediately. Idrees, you come inside. For God’s sake, leave. Leave. I will come meet you. Go. Come on, son. Yes, mom? Salman, son, you come home immediately. Why? What happened? 
Is all okay? It is not okay. Come and see with your own eyes
what your father has done. What do you mean? Hello. I have asked them to come inside. They are not my guests. They are uncle’s guests. Aunt, meet her, she too is my aunt. Uncle’s second wife. Mussarat Idrees Ahmad. So, Mr. Idrees, is this your Islamabad. You are living here in Karachi, and I am ruined here in this city. Idrees, who is this woman? I am asking you, who is she and what nonsense 
is she speaking? Idrees has no other lie 
to speak now. I will tell you. I am Idree’s wife. You didn’t do good, Idrees. Let Salman come home once, he will teach you a lesson. God damn it. Did you not have shame 
lying to two women? You turned out to be a
black goat.
