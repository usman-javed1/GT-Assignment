[22.52] Arooj,
[23.80] what you did was not right.
[27.16] What did I do?
[29.00] I brought the truth 
in front of everyone.
[39.64] Why do you not like it this much?
[41.84] You have attacked my position 
in this home,
[44.04] you will have to pay the price for it.
[45.08] Be quiet.
[54.64] Right now, you are not in 
a position to threaten me.
[66.08] And as much as you have 
conspired against me,
[69.88] I have paid the price for it 
a long time back.
[79.68] I am only taking revenge from you.
[92.92] How many times did I tell you
[95.28] not to try to poison my life 
with Salman?
[107.88] But sadly,
[109.76] despite me asking you a thousand times,
 you didn’t listen to me once.
[121.40] Actually, you know why?
[123.76] Because you enjoy ruining 
the homes of others.
[127.40] What do you think, will that 
Mussarat be able to prove anything?
[134.28] This is not true.
[135.72] You will not be able 
to win this time either.
[137.72] This has nothing to do 
with my win or loss.
[141.04] She is your second wife, 
keep her with respect,
[144.16] make your home.
[170.32] And also let me live 
my life peacefully.
[188.12] So, then,
[190.12] victory is yours, right?
[200.00] What is wrong younger madam?
[202.64] Is everything fine?
[214.52] I hope everything will be 
fine really soon.
[434.76] Salman, son,
[436.32] come home immediately.
[448.76] See what your father has done 
with your own eyes.
[502.56] Shaista. Shaista, listen to me.
[505.24] I am telling you, that I don’t know
that woman.
[509.12] I didn’t ask you this.
[519.24] Huh?
[521.80] I will not give you any chance 
to give justifications.
[531.80] I am making way to the wealth,
[534.76] by defeating Mehreen and Arooj,
[547.36] and you have wives.
[550.32] Hey, those wedding papers are fake.
[552.00] Why are you worried? It is fake.
[553.56] I am not worried. Understand 
what I am saying.
[562.84] I am not from amongst those wives,
[568.00] who sits down to cry seeing their husband
in a relation with some other woman.
[584.80] I have a young son.
[587.12] Now he will deal with these matters.
[591.56] Salman?
[596.08] Why are you involving Salman
 in these matters,
[598.32] he has to do a lot of things
in business.
[601.60] Why are you worried?
[606.44] You just said that woman is a liar.
[610.28] Yes, she…
[612.04] So, we will see.
[614.48] Salman is coming home 
from the office.
[625.28] Pray that woman turns out 
to be a liar.
[676.52] Pick up the phone uncle.
[679.28] I feel you are getting calls 
from two places.
[683.68] I will answer it, it is my issue.
[687.56] By the way,
[689.60] you have two numbers, right?
[692.96] No,
[694.40] I just have one number.
[696.32] Oh, no,
[698.04] then you must have confusion.
[702.68] When the first one would call,
[704.48] you would take the name of the second
[706.12] and when the second one calls, 
you would take the name of the first.
[718.16] What do you want?
[719.96] You are really worried 
from my questions.
[724.32] I am surprised,
[726.72] the one who answers 
to the entire world has
[730.88] no answer for me today.
[785.16] Hello. Nawaz.
[786.64] Yes, boss?
[787.92] You didn’t come to the office today.
[789.60] Leave that and tell me did 
Mussarat come to the office?
[792.64] No boss, she didn’t come, 
if you want, I can call her.
[796.08] Stop your nonsense and 
hear what I am saying.
[799.56] Mussarat came here with my son.
[802.80] At home? Who brought her there?
[805.04] Who can bring her?
[806.64] I have just one enemy, Arooj.
[813.72] Now you keep your eyes and 
ears open
[816.48] and if you see Mussarat there, 
then call me immediately.
[819.16] Got it?
[820.92] Yes, boss.
[834.12] I am not from amongst those wives,
[836.16] who sits down to cry seeing their husband
in a relation with some other woman.
[845.56] I have a young son.
[848.16] Now he will deal with these matters.
[852.36] Salman?
[856.96] Why are you involving Salman
in these matters,
[859.12] he has to do a lot of things 
in business.
[862.40] Why are you worried?
[867.48] You just said that woman is a liar.
[871.12] Yes, she…
[872.84] So, we will see.
[875.28] Salman is coming home 
from the office.
[883.12] Pray that woman turns out 
to be a liar.
[894.64] What will happen when 
Salman finds out?
[924.32] I am Idree’s wife
[926.88] and we have been married 
for fourteen years.
[939.84] Fourteen years?
[948.96] Idrees, what is she saying?
[954.80] Answer me.
[956.36] She is saying you married her.
[959.72] Hey, I don’t know who 
this woman is.
[962.76] Really?
[964.08] Then I am sure you don’t even
recognize your son.
[974.40] And you must not even 
recognize this ring
[1064.96] Did you see?
[1066.80] Your maternal and paternal 
grandma has two princesses.
[1071.00] One is princess Arooj
[1073.04] and one is princess Areej.
[1092.64] Love.
[1132.44] Salman?
[1158.36] Meaning,
[1164.64] the mother has called her son
[1170.20] against his father.
[1176.28] Maybe these people will have their
attention diverted from mama and I,
[1185.12] getting stuck in these worries.
[1214.84] Mom.
[1220.60] Mom.
[1239.20] Salman is here.
[1241.00] Mama,
[1243.76] Salman didn’t call you.
[1278.56] What had to happen, what had 
to pass, has passed.
[1281.80] Now you don’t have to pull me back
in my past, aunt Mehreen.
[1285.76] You called me aunty?
[1290.44] Yes, I did,
[1293.08] and I will call you aunty 
in future too.
[1299.76] All of you, especially you,
[1302.96] ruined my life.
[1305.64] To save your life you took away
 my entire childhood.
[1309.40] Salman…
Get away.
[1311.64] Go away.
[1315.40] You don’t need to come 
in front of me in future.
[1318.36] Salman.
[1326.48] You have found your daughter,
[1332.48] save these emotions for her.
[1344.88] He is calling his mother,
[1354.24] then who am I?
[1368.64] Am I not his mother?
[1388.44] Salman has changed so much.
[1398.04] This is how a mother’s love 
is being repaid.
[1453.24] What is the matter, mom?
[1454.48] You had called. 
Is everything fine?
[1457.48] Son,
[1458.76] she came, she sat here, 
and she left suddenly.
[1464.28] What do you mean 
who sat here?
[1467.76] Who?
[1470.08] His second wife.
[1482.00] Second wife?
[1495.92] What do you mean? 
What are you saying?
[1497.76] I don’t understand.
[1500.24] When you left for office,
[1502.32] immediately a woman came
[1504.52] and said she is his second wife.
[1507.12] Hey, she was lying. She was lying.
[1518.32] I don’t know
[1519.64] if she was speaking 
the truth or lying,
[1522.00] but she had wedding papers…
[1524.00] Hey, I said those were fake.
[1533.08] Can I complete what I am saying?
[1535.68] It is a matter of my respect and you 
want to complete what you were saying?
[1544.00] I have told you,
[1545.44] what relation will I have with another 
woman with you there?
[1553.96] And you got fooled by her.
[1560.24] If she was honest, then 
she would be sitting here.
[1562.96] Yes.
[1564.24] Whoever she was, honest or liar,
but why did she come here?
[1576.20] Son, only Arooj can tell us this.
[1581.80] What do you mean?
[1583.92] What does Arooj have to do 
with this matter?
[1586.72] Yes, Arooj called her here.
[1597.68] And she introduced her to me 
as Mrs. Idrees Ahmad.
[1611.36] She is really cunning, son.
[1613.36] She knows that she can only 
take over the wealth
[1615.16] when there are misunderstandings 
between us
[1631.20] or else,
[1632.52] who do I have other than you 
or Shaista? Huh?
[1646.76] Where is Arooj?
[1648.48] Arooj.
[1651.04] Arooj.
[1685.48] Your issues will not get resolved,
[1686.88] the politics at home will continue. 
I am going to the office.
[1745.56] Will I lie about such a big thing?
[1751.32] Okay enough. 
One second.
[1754.00] One second.
[1763.48] This allegation that 
you are putting,
[1767.80] do you have any proof of this?
[1774.76] So, tell me,
[1776.72] do you have proof,
[1783.28] that whatever you are saying is true.
[1786.96] Why are you quiet? 
Speak up.
[1789.32] The only proof a woman 
has is her wedding.
[1796.20] Our wedding is proof of this,
[1798.52] and I have the wedding papers.
[1823.52] What happened Salman?
[1824.88] What nonsense is this?
[1827.08] What did I do?
[1829.92] Will you not stop your cunningness?
[1832.88] What is my fault?
[1835.96] What is your fault?
[1838.00] Did you not have shame in putting 
allegation on a man as old as your father.
[1843.04] I have not put any allegation.
[1844.92] Uncle got married and getting 
married is not a sin.
[1848.36] Arooj, don’t talk senseless things 
in front of me, I am telling you.
[1851.60] I didn’t say anything senseless.
[1854.52] Arooj,
[1856.16] I am warning you, stop all this 
or you will see the worst in me.
[1860.16] I am speaking the truth, Salman.
[1861.80] I met her myself,
[1867.20] I went to her home.
I called her here.
[1870.16] If you talk to her, 
she will tell you everything…
[1872.48] Stop your nonsense.
[1877.56] You say you are honest, right?
[1880.16] Yes.
[1881.80] Then fine,
[1884.36] you have till the evening 
to prove yourself
[1895.44] or else you will apologize to dad 
in front of everyone.
[1951.68] Where did she go?
[1958.84] Arooj, I had told you
[1960.56] that Shaista would turn out to be a 
much worse mother-in-law than Mehreen.
[1963.28] See my prediction.
[1965.12] At times I feel you are not 
being treated good.
[1968.60] I feel you have holes
 in your hands.
[1974.20] Check. Check. See, 
if I am right or not.
[1986.68] No, you won’t be able to see it, 
but I can see
[1989.76] that you have a hole 
in your hands.
[1997.60] Because when Salman would be
a good husband,
[2000.36] you couldn’t control Mehreen,
[2005.80] and when you got the relation 
of your mother,
[2008.36] then the husband got distanced 
from you.
[2011.16] I feel you don’t know 
how to live in relations.
