[30.68] You have put a crack 
in my home.
[34.00] I didn’t know.
[36.32] Idrees told me that
he divorced his wife,
[39.16] he is single.
[51.80] and you believed him?
[54.72] If a man cries and asks
a woman for sympathy,
[64.80] then the woman becomes helpless.
[69.68] I thought there is a man troubled
by circumstances,
[73.44] a worn-out person,
who needs support.
[114.16] This has nothing to do
with my win or loss.
[117.36] She is your second wife,
keep her with respect,
[120.44] make your home.
[131.24] And also let me live
my life peacefully.
[142.84] So, then,
[144.80] victory is yours, right?
[151.36] What is wrong younger madam?
[153.84] Is everything fine?
[162.52] I hope everything will be
fine really soon.
[200.68] I have lived all my life
in worries, son
[213.80] and now this adventure
of your father.
[218.96] Dad didn’t do anything.
[228.76] Whatever has been done has been
done by Arooj.
[241.68] I apologize to you on her behalf.
[253.76] Why do you apologize, son?
[259.88] The one who did all this
should apologize.
[268.20] She will.
[275.08] She surely will.
[278.88] That too by pleading you.
[285.28] Today I have found out how big a
support is a young son for his mother.
[303.72] Don’t worry,
[306.96] everything will be fine.
[508.08] It is locked.
[514.44] Excuse me.
Yes, madam?
[515.88] Why is this home locked?
[518.40] These people have left
the home and gone.
[521.72] They have gone?
[524.12] When?
[525.12] Their things just left.
[528.12] Oh,
[530.36] can you tell me where
these people went?
[532.44] I know nothing about this.
[534.48] Okay fine, thank you.
Thank you.
[537.76] They left?
[552.80] Did you not have shame in putting
allegation on a man as old as your father.
[556.56] Uncle got married
[558.20] and getting married is not a sin.
[560.12] Arooj, don’t talk senseless things
in front of me, I am telling you.
[563.20] I didn’t say anything senseless.
[566.08] Arooj,
[567.76] I am warning you, stop all this or
you will see the worst in me.
[571.72] I am speaking the truth, Salman.
[573.44] I met her myself,
[576.48] I went to her home.
I called her here.
[579.28] If you talk to her,
she will tell you everything…
[581.40] Stop your nonsense.
[584.56] You say you are honest, right?
[587.04] Yes.
[588.68] Then fine,
[591.24] you have till the evening
to prove yourself
[595.68] or else you will apologize to dad
in front of everyone.
[702.76] Will you not talk about anything,
wife of mine?
[705.48] Can you call me your wife
in front of people.
[709.16] Hey, try and understand.
[712.56] Why do I understand every time?
[715.36] And you only make me understand.
[717.72] Understand this.
Understand that.
[720.20] Why don’t you understand yourself,
Idrees?
[727.44] These wedding functions, orchestra,
music, wedding, reception,
[731.16] this is done to announce the wedding,
that both of us are husband and wife.
[743.04] But…
[745.92] but nothing like this was done
when it was my turn, Idrees
[755.00] and when could it done?
[757.04] This wedding is a secret wedding.
[759.36] Proving it is impossible.
[761.60] You have the wedding papers, right?
[763.28] That is also my doing
[765.08] or else you were saying that what is
the need of putting this in writing?
[768.64] It is useless.
[770.28] Okay, I am sorry. Forgive me.
[773.64] Okay, do one thing, keep this cheque
for two hundred thousand.
[776.84] Get what you want, okay?
[782.44] This is less.
[783.72] Hey, so you will get more.
[786.40] Idress I am not talking
about money.
[789.96] I…
[792.08] I don’t want to keep our wedding
a secret now.
[794.56] Arooj taught you this lesson, right?
[797.04] First you promise me, you will
stay away from her.
[799.56] And no one should find out
this new address,
[801.64] your number should also be new.
[803.52] In return, I promise you,
[805.40] that once I get  my hands on
this business and properties,
[808.28] after that, I will get rid of Shaista,
[810.16] it will just me you and me. Yes.
[812.28] Are you speaking the truth?
[814.52] Yes, I am speaking the truth.
[816.36] Even if I die, still your anger
will not be reduced.
[818.84] What is wrong with you? God forbid,
What nonsense are you speaking?
[822.44] Look, I have made a promise.
[824.44] At least now get me
a good cup of tea.
[826.68] Yes, yes, I will make tea
for you myself and bring it.
[830.04] Okay.
[839.40] What did I do?
[841.28] I brought the truth
in front of everyone.
[844.20] Why do you not like it this much?
[846.20] You have attacked my position
in this home,
[848.44] you will have to pay the price for it.
Be quiet.
[854.68] Right now, you are not in
a position to threaten me.
[861.76] And as much as you have
conspired against me,
[865.44] I have paid the price for it
a long time back.
[871.72] I am only taking revenge from you.
[879.00] How many times did I tell you
[881.52] not to try to poison my life
with Salman?
[889.72] But sadly,
[891.48] despite me asking you a thousand times,
you didn’t listen to me once.
[900.88] She is under control now.
[908.24] Now I will teach Arooj a lesson that
she will go around crying.
[941.12] Arooj, this is something bad
that the woman did.
[944.76] Shanzay, what can I say now?
[947.60] Hey, she got such a good opportunity
to get her right,
[950.88] she disappeared.
[952.60] God knows where she went,
[955.00] but she left me in difficulty.
[963.52] Salman is really upset
with me anyway,
[966.04] now I will become a criminal
in front of him.
[969.56] Okay, you be strong.
Don’t worry.
[972.20] If you want, can I talk to
brother Salman?
[974.52] After all, I know everything
about this wedding.
[977.32] What do you mean?
Will you talk to Salman?
[986.92] What is wrong, Shanzay?
[989.08] He considers me a liar,
[991.08] then how can he believe
what my friend said.
[994.52] Arooj, all this is your fault.
[997.16] When you had found out
the truth about uncle Idrees,
[1000.04] then you should have told
brother Salman first.
[1003.52] I tried to help uncle and instead
I got stuck in it myself.
[1016.92] Anyway, I don’t know
what will happen.
[1020.64] Okay, I will call you,
[1022.08] right now I don’t understand
anything.
[1024.36] Goodbye.
[1025.92] Okay take care, then tell me
what happened.
[1029.00] Okay, bye.
[1032.76] What has she done.
[1049.68] I have to see all that is
written in my fate.
[1055.92] Where do I find this aunt Mussarat?
[1546.28] I searched for you everywhere.
[1549.24] Why did you leave the home
and go?
[1551.32] I had told you to wait,
you left and went away.
[1554.84] You know, everyone is calling me
a liar at home,
[1557.20] that I am lying and no one came.
[1560.00] You should have cared
about my respect a little.
[1562.72] I was doing everything
for your good and…
[1566.00] Yes, Shanzay.
[1567.72] I have found Mussarat,
I am talking to her.
[1569.88] I will call you back. I…
[1702.92] This wedding is a secret wedding.
[1705.32] Proving it is impossible.
[1707.68] You have the wedding papers, right?
[1709.12] That is also my doing
[1711.00] or else you were saying that what is
the need of putting this in writing?
[1714.56] It is useless.
[1716.12] Okay, I am sorry. Forgive me.
[1719.52] Okay, do one thing, keep this cheque
for two hundred thousand.
[1722.76] Get what you want, okay?
[1728.16] This is less.
[1729.36] Hey, so you will get more.
[1732.32] Idress I am not talking
about money.
[1735.80] I…
[1737.96] I don’t want to keep our wedding
a secret now.
[1740.36] Arooj taught you this lesson, right?
[1742.92] First you promise me,
you will stay away from her.
[1745.52] And no one should find out
this new address,
[1747.48] your number should also be new.
[1749.36] In return, I promise you,
[1750.96] that once I get  my hands on
this business and properties,
[1754.08] after that, I will get rid of Shaista,
it will just me you and me.
[1757.28] Yes.
[1861.64] I searched for you everywhere.
[1864.60] Why did you leave the home
and go?
[1866.68] I had told you to wait,
you left and went away.
[1870.16] You know, everyone is calling me
a liar at home,
[1872.68] that I am lying and no one came.
[1875.40] You should have cared
about my respect a little.
[1878.04] I was doing everything
for your good and…
[1881.36] Yes, Shanzay.
[1883.20] I have found Musarat,
I am talking to her.
[1885.32] I will call you back.
[1970.68] Dad,
[1972.40] forget this now.
[1978.72] Whatever Arooj did was
absolutely wrong
[1985.60] and I will surely punish her for it.
[1987.72] I promise you.
[1989.80] But my position got spoiled
in front of your mother.
[1993.56] Mom, wouldn’t have believed her.
[1997.32] Arooj has really hurt me a lot, son.
[2006.76] That too such an allegation
at this age.
