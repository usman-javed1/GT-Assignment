Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. Miss Nousheen. Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Miss Urooj, you have your interview. Please. Hey, Mr. Salman, you? Why are you standing here? Come inside. What is going on? We are having job interviews. Should I inform Mr. Nasir? No, there is no need for that. Okay, sir. Wow. Wow. Wow. Mr. Salman is in our office
 early in the morning. Wow. What happened?
 Did you talk to her? By the way, it is such
 a beautiful coincidence. This was not a coincidence. I was sure she would come. Coincidence is what has
 happened right now. What happened now? What was the name of the girl who
 just gave an interview and went. Urooj. Urooj Shoaib. 
That was her name. Urooj. Was this the same girl? Yes. This was the same girl. By the way, how was her interview? So-so, but she wasn’t fulfilling the 
company’s requirement. So I rejected her. What do you mean you rejected her? Are you crazy? You rejected such a pretty girl. Oh hello, my dear friend Salman Waqar. This company doesn’t need
 pretty and beautiful girls. It needs intelligent and skillful girls, and after all I have already hired a
 candidate for this post. But, this girl…what was her name? Urooj. She is very, very, educated and 
very sincere to her work. But I am sorry. You call Urooj tomorrow. I am telling you, if you hire Urooj, your company will touch new heights. Call her tomorrow. Okay, I will call her, but 
I have a condition. Tell me your condition. You will interview her, and you will get her appointment
 letter made as well. Done. I am in. You call this girl tomorrow and prepare her appointment
 letter. Alright? Yeah, alright. Urooj. Someday, my patience will run out. It will be your stupidity. If you break down after 
waiting for so long, then what did you get? Think about it. Fine. I will take care of my patience, but I am a mother. How long will I stop myself? I am afraid, Idrees. I just know that if something 
like this happens, then everything will be useless. Mehreen instigates me. Her behavior tortures me. She doesn’t let me go around Salman, and then she calls him her son. As much as she knows, 
as much as she understands, she is right by that perspective. She is right? My motherhood got 
killed for no reason. You should have thought about this, 
when it was time to decide. Now the arrow has left the bow. It has not been pulled 
out of my chest. Then take it out. Think, understand, after that
do what you want. No, you cannot get rid of what 
I said by saying this. That decision wasn’t
 just mine, alone. You too were with me in 
agreeing to mama’s decision. Shahista, I am still standing strong. It is useless to talk to you. Leave his collar. Are you leaving it or not? Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Alright, Miss Urooj Shoaib, I will meet you tomorrow. Greetings. Greetings. Urooj Shoaib. Yes, yes, sir is waiting for you. Thank you. Come in. Good morning sir. Good morning. How are you? Yes, I am fine. Have a seat. Thank you. There was some other sir yesterday, who took my interview. But you can see this file of mine. There is no need for that. You? Yes, me. You can join the office from tomorrow. But till yesterday, I was refused, what happened suddenly? Yes, we had appointed a girl, but I think you deserve this job. So you fired that girl before you hired her. Exactly. That’s why I called you. Thanks. But I am not interested in this job at all. I think the girl you people
 had selected earlier, she deserves this job. You will not decide that, we will. That who we have to hire and who we don’t have to hire. and I too have this complete right, that I can decide where I want to do a job, and where I don’t want to do a job. Had I known you 
would be present here, then I would never have come. I think you didn’t forget the
 incident from that day. I don’t forget such incidents. And people like you who don’t considers humans, human. You trample people in 
your pride and ego. This is wrong. How can you judge my personality
 with the incident that day? Not good. I am getting this job on your 
recommendation. No, there is nothing like that. This is not the truth? If I deserved this job, then I would have been 
appointed yesterday. Fine, then, you got this job because of me. There you go. You know, mister, this is your basic issue, you want to do what you want. Take that day’s incident for example. You hit the guy on the motorcycle a lot. Why? Because he came in your way and you were in a hurry to go. And today, you fired a girl from the job, because you want that I do this job. You are such a shameless man. I am sorry, I don’t like doing a job
 with such people. and I too have this complete right, that I can decide where I want to do a job, and where I don’t want to do a job. Had I known you 
would be present here, then I would never have come. I think you didn’t forget the
 incident from that day. I don’t forget such incidents. And people like you who don’t considers humans, human. You trample people in
 your pride and ego. Wow. So much attitude in front of Salman, this demeanor. Wow, what an attitude. How is this fearlessness of yours 
possible in front of me? I need to answer, and an answer will be given. What are you looking at, child? That’s it, you have worked enough. As soon as I find a job, you take a retirement. If I sit at home, then I will fall ill. Then who will take care of 
the matters of the school? The one who comes in your place, 
will take care of it. Okay, you tell me, how was the interview? Interview? Actually, papa, I didn’t like that job. Really child? The job too is as per your liking? Like your clothes and shoes. Why do I feel I am getting insulted? No, not at all. This is an allegation. Both the father and daughter are
 enjoying some special topic. Yes. The daughter didn’t like the job, so she quit it and came. It is fine, no issues. I will find a job that I will for 
and that I like, you will see. Come on, I have cooked 
your favourite food, come on. Let’s go! You  know about me. I am unable to tolerate 
something wrong at all. Urooj, you have to tolerate the wrong thing, or else what is the point of 
tolerating the right thing. What does this mean? I mean, you yourself were saying 
he is really handsome. Look, you shouldn’t have done this with him. Aren’t you talking a bit too much? And you are really favouring him. Eat quietly. The food is good, you know. Between us, it is really delicious. Listen, I will ask for the bill. He will bring the bill till we finish food. Hmmm. Excuse me. Yes, madam. Bring our bill. Bring it in a little while. Your bill has been paid, madam. It has been paid? Who paid it? That sir paid your bill. He has come here after me as well. I will not leave him today. How much was our bill? Eighteen hundred. Fine, thank you. Now you see, what I do with him. Not right now. What is the need right now? Mister, why did you pay my bill? Who are you? Look, whatever happened
 that day wasn’t right. I am sorry for that. You come, have a seat, we will talk. Look, you said sorry, I accepted your sorry. Now you don’t try to be 
too frank, okay? Your bill. And keep the change. Come on, Shanzay. Man, let me finish food. 
I am really hungry. I have eaten all that 
I had to. I am going. You eat. Okay, wait. I had a lot of fun today. Right? Fine, you leave then. Okay then, take lots of 
care of yourself. We will meet again. Okay, goodbye. Urooj. Whatever happened there, I apologize to you for it once again. It was my mistake, I am really embarrassed about it. So I told you that I forgave you. Your sorry is done. Now? Look, I am not such a person. 
Not at all. I am not interested in this, if you are this type of person,
 that type person, whatever type of person. And even now you are doing wrong. What is wrong in this? You follow me like this again and again, this is really insulting for me. Whenever I see her, I feel I am looking at myself. She is even more stubborn than me. By the way, I had asked 
you to do something, did you do it? What work has not been done? Who is Urooj? Where does she live? Who is her family? You didn’t tell me till now. I have found out. Here you go. This has all the information. Well done. Thank you so much. I didn’t understand one thing, what will you do with this information? I mean, such a big businessman 
of this city is going so crazy after such an ordinary girl. I mean why? She is not an ordinary girl. The one who stops Salman’s hand, how can she be ordinary? What are you doing? Sit. Sit. Sit. Child, after trying a lot, my dream is going to be fulfilled. What dream? You know, Urooj, I want to make a computer 
lab in the school. Yes, and for this you are always trying. So think that the time for it has come. The arrangements are being 
made to make a computer lab. Oh wow, papa. Honestly? This is really good. But how did this happen? I had made an appeal for help on 
our school’s social media page, so some people contacted
 us themselves. Papa, this is really good. But I will tell you something, I don’t have money, I will not give you a donation. Yes, if there is something else,
 then tell me, I will do that. I will. Without you, no work of 
mine is complete. And as far as the 
donation is concerned, you are the biggest donation of my life. When you are with me, I have everything. You are not my daughter, you are my son. Thank you, papa. Look at this. It is necessary to tell the 
guests here today, that this function today is because of an old wish of this 
schools head master, Mr. Shoaib. He always wanted that there should be a computer
 lab in this school. But still even after trying hard, the money couldn’t be arranged. But today, by the grace of God, this 
effort of his has been fulfilled. The respectable businessman 
and builder of the city, Salman Waqar, has promised that he will provide funds to build 
a computer lab in the school and he will be with us in a little while, and I wish that welcome him well. Welcome, sir. Thank you so much. Come on, sir. Come. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Salman Waqar, who is headed this way. Thank you so much everyone 
for having me over here. Firstly, I want to say that I was not like this earlier. I was really stubborn and short tempered. I would stay lost in my own world. I didn’t care about anyone’s 
sorrow and pain. But then someone came in my life, they made me realize that life is not what I used to think. In fact, life is really different. She introduced me to the colours of life. She changed my thinking and today, whatever I am doing is my first step towards
my changing thinking. And today on this occasion, I just want to say to that person, that, thanks for coming in my life and making my life beautiful. Thank you so much, everyone. Mr. Salman, come on. No thank you, you continue your event. I have to go. Mr. Salman. Sir, you cannot leave like this. Master, I have a really
 important meeting. I have to go. You must have so much time that you have a cup of tea with our staff. Everyone wants to meet you. Look, I would have surely stayed, but a lot of time  has passed. But next time for sure. Okay, as you wish. But thank you very much. My pleasure. Mr. Salman is a big 
businessman of the city. I thought it would be a cheque of 
three to four hundred thousand. How much is the cheque for, master? Naseem, for two million. Two million? Yes. How much did you say, papa? Two million, child. Two million? Yes. Such a big sum of money 
for the donation. Yes, so child, your father is telling us that he is a big businessman. He is a really good, young man. Yes? Sir, some Urooj Shoaib 
has come to meet you. Send her in. Okay sir. Madam, when you go from here,
 sir is in the first room. Thank you. Come in. Oh, Miss Urooj. Welcome. Welcome. Have a seat. Okay tell me, what will you have? Tea? Coffee? Juice? No thanks. Can I know why are you are blessing 
my father so much? Blessing? What blessing? Look whatever
 I did was not for your father, in fact, it was for the children 
who couldn’t afford laptops. You are wrong. You are trying to impress 
me with your wealth. There is nothing like that. That’s how it is and this action of 
yours was really cheap. I feel you still haven’t forgiven me. You always take me wrong. Such cheap actions of yours 
won’t make a difference to me. And I know rich people like you well. Who only want to impress girls 
by showing off their wealth. Urooj. Urooj. Urooj, listen to me. I don’t want to hear anything. But I want to talk to you.
