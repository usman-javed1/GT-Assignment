[27.72] What would you say after looking 
at all this that has happened.
[32.36] Have patience, Salman,
[35.20] it wouldn’t be talked the way 
you are doing it.
[39.72] Aunt, you are taking this situation 
very lightly.
[43.36] Yes,
[44.56] that is what we have to do.
[47.28] But you said the same to me before
[51.40] to behave softly with Arooj.
[55.88] But you didn’t behave softly with her.
[59.96] look,
[61.80] I tried a lot,
[64.20] I tried to make her understand 
but it was of no use,
[69.28] now you tell me what should I do?
[71.20] Whatever had happened,
[74.12] forget all that and move forward.
[78.36] I should forget it?
[81.56] She is meeting Ammad there and 
you are asking me to forget it,
[84.00] what are you even saying?
[85.40] You heard it right, 
that is what I am saying.
[88.84] Fine,
[90.04] but you are not accepting the truth.
[92.84] I am sure you must be telling the truth,
[96.48] but I don’t doubt Arooj’s truth.
[101.44] Even after looking at the picture? 
Yes.
[104.32] Arooj has not denied the truth of the picture,
she said it is her picture,
[109.64] did you see her confidence?
[112.32] That is why I am completely sure
[114.96] Arooj cannot do anything wrong.
[121.28] Salman, don’t worry,
[124.04] I will talk to Arooj, 
I will talk to her to the point.
[130.60] Just control your anger, please.
[141.28] I will go crazy.
[150.16] I don’t understand anything.
[171.24] When things got so complicated then
[173.64] how come Arooj gave you a new job?
[177.20] Which job? And what kind of job?
[180.28] This, to find the finance leakage.
[183.08] Hunh, that’s a not a job,
[185.36] it is a consultation,
[186.80] and whenever Arooj will need me, 
I will help her.
[192.60] But why have you guys kept this job 
such confidential and secret?
[196.96] Look, everything linked with leakage
is a secret.
[202.04] Don’t you think anything happening 
without bringing it in the CEO’s knowledge
[206.40] and that too for someone 
who CEO dislikes?
[211.16] I don’t know that,
[212.56] I have to fulfill my friendship and 
job with full honesty and that’s it.
[217.16] Okay Mr. consultation but 
precautions are important
[220.12] until you get the results, 
do you understand?
[222.80] Yes, I do understand,
[225.84] I also know that Salman doesn’t like me
 that is why I left the company
[231.88] but whatever I am doing right now
is for company’s benefit.
[236.52] Look, Ammad, I completely 
trust your loyalty.
[240.64] Thank you.
[242.48] But I am just scared that brother Salman
might take this negatively.
[246.96] Look Shanzey,
[248.84] I completely believe that to prove 
the truth, it is enough that it is the truth
[254.28] and we don’t need any support 
to prove the truth.
[260.96] Have coffee.
[263.44] Yes.
[267.84] Mmm,
[268.92] it is good.
[305.52] Salman, you are asking me 
for clarification,
[309.80] but I am helpless
[312.44] I cannot tell you anything 
before the right time,
[316.76] I can’t take you in confidence,
[322.32] I cannot tell you how important it is 
for Ammad to be by my side for my victory.
[330.40] I also know that if I am unable 
to prove anything
[334.12] I will be standing at the same place
[335.76] where you will kick me out of your life,
[340.00] and I won’t be able to bear that,
[342.96] I love you.
[347.12] I just need your trust, Salman.
[362.96] Wasai?
[366.52] Wasai?
[367.92] Yes, madam I am here.
[376.68] Where is Arooj? 
She is not even in her room.
[379.96] Madam,
[381.36] Madam is outside in the lawn.
[384.24] Shall I call her if you want?
[387.00] No, no I will go to her myself.
[433.84] What happened, my child?
[436.12] Why are you sitting here like this?
[440.60] Just like that,
[443.08] I wanted to breath in fresh air.
[454.80] Look my child I know 
you are a very good girl,
[460.00] but even good people can 
make mistakes.
[469.44] Whatever you want to say, 
say it clearly,
[472.84] I am ready to listen.
[477.20] Arooj, you know Salman doesn’t 
like you meeting Ammad,
[482.96] so why do you meet him?
[486.88] Why shouldn’t I meet him?
[489.32] I don’t have any negative 
intentions, Aunt.
[492.24] You are right
[493.56] but my child, that’s not how 
you can spend your life.
[496.92] I don’t even want to spend 
my live like this,
[500.52] Aunt, I want to live my life.
[504.36] How will you stay happy
[506.24] or live when your life partner 
is not happy?
[511.76] Just wait and watch, 
nothing like that will happen.
[515.72] When Salman finds out everything,
[518.72] he will regret it
[521.84] that how can he even think 
like that about me.
[530.40] my child, whatever you are thinking,
[533.68] just take Salman in confidence
 before the result.
[540.60] Why don’t you tell Salman everything?
[544.64] I guess it’s not the time to tell 
all that to Salman,
[551.68] but I will tell him,
[553.64] I will tell him everything, 
trust me, Aunt.
[557.88] I blindly trust you.
[561.92] Then don’t worry,
[564.76] I will never break this trust of yours.
[567.80] I know.
[616.12] Hello?
[618.24] How are you, Salman?
[621.96] I am not okay.
[626.52] I was really worried for you.
[631.20] I mean the kind of workload you have
[634.16] and the situation of your life,
[636.68] you under a lot of stress.
[641.08] Don’t take so much stress.
[646.76] I don’t take stress,
[650.36] I am being given stress.
[654.84] Arooj…
[656.44] Arooj? What Arooj?
[659.44] She tells me that
[662.24] she has a relationship of loyalty
with Ammad.
[665.80] Salman, you want to stretch 
the loyalty factor and take it there
[672.60] where you get the answer 
that you need.
[675.80] Dude, don’t talk about irrelevant stuff
and confuse me.
[680.64] Loyalty is the first condition of love 
and I cannot ignore this.
[686.64] Salman, with this mindset,
[690.16] you cannot get a solution.
[692.60] So then what will you say about it?
[695.92] That she stands with a lot of confidence
to answer my questions.
[702.92] What should I think of it?
[705.92] Salman, you answered 
my question yourself.
[711.60] Whoever is telling the truth, 
this is the kind of confidence they have,
[718.60] and the one who lies only tries 
to avoid eye contact.
[726.32] Bye.
[757.12] What has happened?
[758.76] What happened Nawaz that 
you coming in running like this.
[761.00] Boss there has been a problem.
[763.20] tell me, whenever you come, 
you come with bad news.
[766.92] Boss, this is the biggest problem 
with stealing,
[769.48] you have a fear of getting caught.
[772.72] What stealing? 
Did you steal something?
[775.36] I? No, Boss, we did.
[781.92] The commission that we got 
from Croma advertising,
[785.32] whose cheques Sir Salman 
signed back-to-back.
[788.64] So?
[789.60] What’s new in this? 
I know that already.
[792.36] What has happened now?
[796.16] Madam Arooj has contacted them,
the accountant just called.
[802.28] What?
[803.40] She even got there?
[804.92] Boss, she gets everywhere,
[807.00] she has asked the accountant to give
the statement in front of Mr. Salman.
[810.76] What statement?
[812.40] That you have done a huge corruption
in the commission.
[816.92] So, then what did the account 
of Croma Advertising say?
[820.16] Boss, he will lose his job, he is 
giving them a run around for now
[823.28] but till when?
 The thief gets caught.
[829.88] Shut up, Nawaz.
[831.16] Why are you always talking rubbish?
[834.32] I have to do something about Arooj,
[836.96] she has given me so much trouble.
[838.88] Boss, even Ammad is involved 
in causing this trouble,
[841.04] he is the one who took out 
all the information.
[846.72] Okay you go away from here for now 
and let me think, go.
[850.20] Okay boss.
[902.60] What happened, brother Idrees?
[904.36] Greetings, Sir.
[912.16] I have never seen you so angry ever?
[920.80] Wasai,
[922.44] get tea for brother Idrees and 
something to eat too.
[925.44] Okay Madam.
[928.36] Shall I send Madam if you want?
[930.92] Let Shaista be and do as much as 
you are told to. Go.
[934.40] Okay.
[936.72] is everything okay, brother Idrees? 
Sit down,
[941.00] tell me what happened.
[947.76] Mehreen I am tired,
[949.32] I think Salman has sold all the shame 
he ever had?
[951.56] You are my elder,
[953.64] but I don’t want to hear such things
about Salman.
[959.60] Anyway, tell me what do you want to say?
[963.00] Mehreen, your daughter-in-law Arooj,
[967.76] look at her activities, look.
[993.48] Wasai?
[996.24] Is there some guest?
[998.24] No, no madam, there is no one
[1001.08] but thank God you came.
[1004.08] Why? Is everything okay?
[1006.04] Madam,
[1007.76] there is some drama about 
to happen in the lawn.
[1013.80] Lawn?
[1015.16] Who is in the lawn?
[1017.52] Madam, sir is very angry
[1021.64] and he even wants to make 
Madam angry.
[1026.44] Wasai, what do you mean?
[1031.80] Tell me properly, what is it?
[1033.72] I am very sure madam,
[1035.80] there is some ditch being dug 
for Madam Jr.
[1043.48] What the hell?
[1046.12] Problems are always created 
for Arooj in this house.
[1057.32] Arooj,
[1059.48] this Arooj still hasn’t stopped 
meeting this boy?
[1062.68] Now you understand? 
Though you didn’t like it
[1065.12] when I said Salman has sold
 the shame in him
[1068.04] though I even showed 
these pictures to Salman.
[1071.92] How, how is that possible?
[1074.44] It is not possible, 
it has already happened.
[1077.24] If there was any man apart 
from Salman
[1078.84] and his wife would be roaming around
 with a guy like this,
[1081.00] he should at least get angry 
for the sake of his dignity.
[1083.44] Yes, he should.
[1084.80] After all, is there anything that 
Arooj doesn’t get in this house?
[1090.16] She has a handsome husband 
like Salman
[1093.04] and she still roams around 
with her employee?
[1096.68] Someone sent me this picture,
[1099.40] I don’t know where she roams around
and what does she do?
[1105.68] I just said it generally,
[1107.32] the girl who is having an affair openly,
why would she care?
[1114.76] Enough is enough,
[1116.84] If Salman still doesn’t leave this girl,
I would be the worst.
[1134.72] what happened to Mehreen?
[1138.16] What do I know? 
You know she is always angry,
[1140.88] she was just badmouthing Arooj.
[1144.92] And I am sure you must have 
supported Mehreen, right?
[1147.80] I don’t need to, I just came from office,
[1150.28] and Mehreen stopped me here.
[1230.68] Mehreen has been continuously 
creating problems for Arooj.
[1235.96] I understand the hatred she has for her
[1239.24] but how did Idrees get against her?
[1244.60] there are only two things that 
create negativity for people,
[1247.48] one is greed and secondly fear,
[1253.36] even if I accept any one of them
[1256.64] so it can be mutual for both Idrees
and Mehreen.
[1272.16] The problem is,
[1275.24] Idrees is not telling anything openly
[1279.12] and Mehreen is not telling either,
[1283.60] but Arooj’s confidence is telling me 
that she is on the right path.
[1315.08] Mehreen, what are you thinking?
[1321.64] Thinking is all what is left,
[1329.40] I just keep on thinking day and night.
[1334.36] That’s wrong,
[1339.04] you should sometimes leave life 
on nature’s flow,
[1345.56] you will automatically find the shore.
[1349.60] The one’s who goes with the flow 
often gets stuck in whirlpool.
[1360.28] Mehreen, don’t you think that
[1363.36] sometimes we are looking for truth
 on the wrong place.
[1368.44] What difference does it make?
[1371.24] We should just do our part,
[1380.36] even if we fail,
[1383.52] we won’t suffer loss.
[1387.40] We will suffer loss,
[1392.12] the one we are trying to prove wrong,
[1396.16] if they turn out to be true,
[1398.20] so who will answer the fingers 
raised on her character?
[1402.36] If she is true…
[1409.96] I mean,
[1412.36] if she is true, she won’t face any loss.
[1442.92] yes, Ammad? Tell me what is the news?
[1445.60] The same thing that we were completely 
sure about,
[1451.04] Uncle has even got stock made from
 that advertising company.
[1458.56] What happened? 
Why are you quiet?
[1465.00] Like this the first time Mr. Idrees has 
taken money from Salman by betraying him.
[1470.04] I am thinking that
[1472.40] what does uncle do with all this money?
[1491.28] He has such handsome salary
[1493.92] and Salman bears all the house expenses.
[1499.76] I am so disappointed in uncle,
[1502.36] what kind of thinking does he have?
[1505.24] You are right.
[1508.08] Anyway,
[1508.92] if you want, I can make you 
meet that guy.
[1514.88] I have asked him to come in front 
of Mr. Salman but he was scared.
[1520.56] No, I think I should meet him first
[1524.84] then I will tell him that 
I am Salman’s wife
[1529.44] I guess then he might 
not get scared
[1531.92] and agree to give a statement.
[1534.08] Yes, that is possible.
[1536.36] Okay, so are you coming?
[1538.56] Yes, I am coming,
[1540.12] in fact, get a meeting arranged 
with him as well,
[1543.56] I will reveal all the corruption of Uncle
 at any cost.
[1548.52] I will just be there.
[1550.08] okay bye take care.
[1598.96] Mom,
[1600.80] come sit.
[1605.28] What is it mom?
[1608.16] Why are you looking at me like this?
[1613.56] Is there any problem?
[1617.28] Salman, do you know
[1620.32] I have raised you with a lot of love
and affection?
[1627.60] I had no idea my son would have
to face so much sorrow.
[1634.32] What sorrow?
[1638.24] I don’t understand.
[1643.72] The biggest sorrow a man has 
in his life is having a disloyal wife
[1654.28] and Arooj is being disloyal to you.
[1656.80] Mom, please
[1662.92] don’t say that about Arooj.
[1668.44] if I won’t the whole world will, Salman.
[1672.72] And I don’t care about Arooj. 
But I do.
[1676.68] I care about Arooj.
[1679.16] Okay then
[1680.92] you may keep on caring,
[1686.12] and if you care so much 
then please tell me
[1690.68] where is Arooj right now?
[1696.88] Salman,
[1700.44] I have seen that picture.
[1714.24] So that means Uncle…
[1716.36] He is the elder in this house 
and he has some rules,
[1720.56] there are some demands 
of dignity, Salman
[1727.48] and if you don’t mind, 
shall I say something to you?
[1733.56] That you have sold your dignity.
[1970.28] Salman, my child, what happened?
[1976.12] yeah?
[1979.20] Are you feeling well?
[1982.88] What happened, my child?
[1986.32] Come inside.
[1989.00] What happened? 
Why aren’t you saying anything?
[1991.64] I will get juice for you. Wasai?
[1994.72] Yes, madam?
[1996.52] Get juice for Mr. Salman.
[1998.96] okay.
[2000.04] Sit here,
[2006.32] now tell me what is it?
[2012.16] Salman, tell me? 
I am not getting a good vibe.
[2015.16] What happened?
[2020.44] Nothing.
[2024.60] What will happen to me?
[2027.76] Hey are you saying that? 
Are you crying?
[2031.20] Son,
[2032.84] you are very strong-willed,
[2035.96] how are you crying like this?
[2044.08] I had someone very close to my heart,
[2048.96] I am breaking for her.
[2053.16] I know,
[2056.04] I know who you are speaking about.
[2059.08] I left the whole world and chose her,
[2065.64] I went against my mother for her.
[2070.56] And what did she do?
[2074.28] What did Arooj do?
[2080.32] Disloyalty,
[2084.44] she has betrayed me.
[2086.44] Salman,
[2088.36] do you even know 
what you are saying?
[2092.80] I know,
[2094.84] I have felt everything.
[2101.40] Son, have juice
[2103.44] and get rid of your anger too.
[2106.08] I don’t need it, take it away.
[2125.52] Look Salman, son,
[2128.52] you should never take yourself to a place
[2131.92] where the return is not possible,
[2135.60] especially about relationships,
[2142.16] I won’t advocate for Arooj today,
[2148.28] that girl is very innocent and simple,
[2153.12] her character will get dirty 
even if we talk about it.
[2161.28] Just give me a few days,
[2164.00] I promise you,
[2166.28] whatever misunderstandings 
you have in your heart,
[2168.96] I will clear them all.
[2179.24] Arooj is not the problem,
[2183.32] the problem are those glasses
[2185.36] that others have put on your eyes, son.
[2191.00] Now no matter how clean 
Arooj’s clothes are,
[2196.92] you will see them as dirty.
