Hey, little madam, you. Don’t stop these tears. Let them flow. It will lessen the burden on your heart. Little madam, that… I heard everything. 
I saw everything, Wasai. You don’t need to say anything. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. No madam, nothing will be fine. All my life has passed, first the step mother’s injustice and this druggie husband. I don’t know how much further 
God will test, Wasai. All will be fine, Wasai. You have served the people of this family; you will get good from here. I know younger madam. This home had given me a safe haven, or else God knows where and in 
what condition Wasai would have been today. Don’t worry, Wasai, I am with you. Nothing will happen. I was just missing you, I thought I would come meet you 
for a while. You did good child, but why did you send the car back? The driver will come, mama. What are you thinking now? Mama, aunt Mehreen is Salman’s mother. The intensity for her love for 
Salman is understandable, but aunt Shaista’s love for Salman and that too with so much intensity, I didn’t understand this. Child, he is the son of that home, so they can love him intensely. I used to think the same thing earlier, but mama, aunt Shaista loving 
Salman more than a mother, and she doesn’t take a step back 
to move forward in this war of love. I am surprised about this. Urooj, you are worried for no reason, and there is nothing surprising, child. It is surprising mama, how can someone love someone 
else’s child so much. That too more than the mother. Impossible, mama. Okay, your tea is getting cold. Have your tea. The picture in your room, in which you have a child in your arms, who is that? That is Salman. He was this young since the time I brought him up. That is why I love him so much. Meaning, you didn’t have a child of your own. Yes. Yes, think that, child. Do you know, Salman, this sea drives me crazy. Really? That is something wrong. If such a beautiful wife of mine goes mad, what will happen to me? Salman. 
Just kidding. Just a second. Hello. Hi Alizay, how are you? Yeah, long time. What? When are you coming to Pakistan? Tomorrow? That’s amazing. Yes, fine, then,
 you will stay at my place. In fact, I will pick you from 
the airport tomorrow. Alright, take care. See you. Who is this Alizay?
I never heard of her before. Alizay? She became my friend 
in university in America. Actually, we studied together 
in university there. She is an interesting girl. You will like her when you meet her. Okay, so she is coming tomorrow. Yes, she is coming tomorrow. I will go to pick her up from the airport. You have not changed at all, in fact, you have become 
even more beautiful. So you just picked me, we just met and you are flirting with me 
as soon as you met me, Salman. I am not flirting with you. You are my friend. I am giving you a compliment. Thank you. But you have changed. You completely forgot me. You never called, nor did you ever think 
of visiting the US, to meet me. No. Why? You know how occupied 
I am in the business. Yes, you have a business empire, 
I know that. Yes. But I have worked really hard 
to setup this empire. I am sure and I am proud of you. 
Thank you. Karachi has changed so much, man. 
I mean… nothing is the same anymore. 
Everything has changed. Obviously, when you come 
after ten years, you will see the change. Yeah, almost ten years. Long time. By the way, I wanted to say 
something to you. Yes? Had you not gotten married Salman, I would have married you. Wait. What? Come on, I am just kidding man. 
I am joking. What was there to be so serious in this? I mean, what problem do you men have? Someone didn’t even start talking 
about marriage, and you started day dreaming. 
Like seriously. Excuse me. I am not day dreaming. And you are…. Really beautiful?
Not at all. You are really ill-mannered. Thank you for the compliment, 
by the way. I am getting such good compliments 
as soon as I came back. Nice. So, tell me more.
How was your flight? The flight was really long. 
I am tired. I will rest, I will be okay. No issues, you are in Karachi, I will take you around a lot. 
Oh, you have to. Sit. 
You must be aunt Mehreen, right? I could recognize you easily because Salman used to talk about 
you so much in America, that my mother is like this, 
my mama is like that. He loves me after all. Exactly, that’s why I had a very clear picture 
of you in my mind. Mom, you leave her, 
she will just keep on talking. Yes, so why should I not talk? It is good to talk. Yes, yes, absolutely. why not. Salman, go get fresh. Yes, mom. You are a really good mother. You care a lot about Salman. I just have one son. Greetings. Greetings. By the way, Alizay, meet my wife, Urooj. Urooj, she is my friend, Alizay. Hi Urooj. You people talk, I will ask Wasai and 
get some food arranged. Arranged? What is that? Meaning, she will arrange food. Oh. 
Are you not hungry? Man, I am starving Salman,
I am so hungry. I will arrange lunch. By the way, I will tell you one thing, as long as Alizay is in Pakistan, 
she will stay at our home. No, no, man. Don’t bother, please, 
I will do something. See, what is this mom? Hey, Salman has said it, 
so you will have to stay. I will tell Wasai to fix the guest room. Wasai. Coming little madam. Yes. You come with me. 
Sure. Tell me more, what was going on in USA? 
What was your routine? Nothing. You tell me, you didn’t contact me after coming back.
Did you get really busy? Why are there three cups? We are two. Urooj is joining us shortly. By the way, Salman. I didn’t understand this decision of yours. What decision? Meaning, that as far as I know you, you are a really choosy man. You are really picky; 
you get everything you like. Then who did you marry? What do you mean? Salman, I mean, this girl is not your type. Why did you marry her? Alizay, don’t say anything about Urooj. She is my love. I married her out of love. Yes, that’s surprising. How? Can we leave this topic? Shall we talk about something else? I left it. Tell me, don’t you plan to get married? 
Do you like someone? Handsome boys like you 
have this big issue. They like hearing things about 
themselves. Fine, I will tell you. I had liked a boy. I wanted to marry him. He got married. Such a stupid guy, right? Alizay, you have always been a good friend 
of mine, and you always will be. I never looked at you that way, and secondly, you know, I could never have shifted to 
America leaving mama. She would always come to meet me
after three to four months and you know how possessive 
I was for her. So, Salman, you had rejected my love for your mama? What is the matter? So much silence. Yes, the two of us were recalling the beautiful
times we spent in the US. We just got lost in that. Urooj, come sit. Where were you? 
I was waiting for you. I was in the kitchen. We were reliving old memories. University life. Those were the golden days of life. The two of us were recalling the beautiful
times we spent in the US. We just got lost in that. what is the matter, Urooj? You have not slept till now. 
Are you not sleepy? I find this Alizay weird. What do you mean? Why do you find her weird? She talks a little too much, and when she starts talking,
she continues. And she talks without thinking, 
she doesn’t know what to say. Yes, that is true, Alizay talks a lot. Actually, she is confident and bold too. Yes, I agree with the last thing you said. She is not just bold,
she is really bold. Why do I feel that you didn’t like 
Alizay that much? You thought right, Salman. I don’t like people who interfere 
in the lives of others. What did she do? I just want to say that there is difference in being 
confident and overconfident. You highlighted the right difference. For your kind information, 
Alizay is really straightforward. Yes. She is a little too forward, that maybe you don’t see. Why are you not drinking juice Alizay? Yes. You know as much time as Salman lived in US, he used to live with me, 
he used to live in my home. Salman had told me. Yes, how could I forget he shares 
everything with you. Obviously, if Salman doesn’t talk to his mother, 
then who will he talk to? Yes. By the way, I am surprised aunty. I am actually very surprised. I mean, how much you and Salman 
resemble each other. You are each other’s copy. You know he would always talk 
about you. He would only talk about you. I feel that he cannot live without you. By the way, Alizay, I like you. Thank you, aunty. I too really like you. Such a lovely person. By the way, I just got a thought in my mind. Salman has been married for long, right? You must want that your grandchildren 
go around the house. I mean, I feel Salman’s children will be 
really pretty, right? Lovely like Salman. I can’t wait to see them. Urooj, child. Why are you standing here alone? Just like that. Are you too also thinking the same thing
I have been thinking since yesterday. I didn’t understand. Even I don’t understand, Salman’s friend Alizay came home 
suddenly and then she stayed too. They have such close friendship? I don’t think all this is right. I don’t think this is right, but maybe we are mistaken. It is possible we are thinking possible. It is possible. But child, remember one thing. Salman really loves you a lot, and the biggest proof of this is that he married you despite 
Mehreen’s opposition, and that was not easy for Salman. You are right about that, aunt. By the way, I just got a thought in my mind. Salman has been married for long, right? You must want that your grandchildren
go around the house. I mean, I feel Salman’s children will be
really pretty, right? Lovely like Salman. This Urooj has entered in the life 
of my son forcefully. I couldn’t stop her from coming, but I can drag her out. It has been so long, Urooj still hasn’t been able 
to become a mother. Now I have to tell Salman, that keeping such a girl in his life 
is really useless. You need a child, and I want my heir. My grandson. Salman’s friend Alizay came home 
suddenly and then she stayed too. They have such close friendship? I don’t think all this is right. Am I getting really disturbed 
because of Salman and Alizay. No, no, Salman cannot do that. Maybe I am doubting him wrongly. But, aunt Shaista is 
an experienced woman. She too felt the same thing, 
that I felt. This means, this thing is there 
somewhere in some form. I pray to God that this doubt of mine, remains a doubt, and this thought dies its own death. This is really disappointing. You have still not emailed 
the SA group of companies? Sir, I have already informed them. So? Where is the result? Our project is getting delayed because 
of their raw material being late. You send them a final email that 
if there is a delay from them now, then we will cancel their agreement. Right, sir. You may go now. 
Right sir. Yes, Urooj, go ahead. Yes, Salman, I wanted to talk to you about 
something important. What do you want to talk about? 
Go ahead. Salman, you and Alizay… I mean taking her informality has led
to a question in my head. What question? When you two were in America, then you used to share the same 
apartment, right? Yes, we used to share an apartment, 
why? Look Salman, earlier, I didn’t even know 
if there is a girl named Alizay, nor did I know that you used 
to share an apartment with her. Because Urooj, Alizay was not 
that important for me, so I forgot to tell you, and by the way, her mama too lived 
with us in the apartment. Okay fine. Not okay, because you are doubting me. Urooj, Alizay is just a friend of mine, and nothing else. Okay fine, you do your work. I am sorry, I disturbed you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I pray to God that whatever 
Salman said is the truth. What are you looking at, aunt? I am looking for something, but I don’t see it. What? I told you; I am looking for something, 
but I don’t see it. By the way, something is going on in your head, that I don’t see. Anyway, why do I care?
