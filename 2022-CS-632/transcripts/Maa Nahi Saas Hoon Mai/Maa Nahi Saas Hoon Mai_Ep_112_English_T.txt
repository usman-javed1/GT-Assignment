[37.43] The situation we are going through,
[40.23] we surely have to steal happiness
[43.40] and getting a job in situation is 
no less than any happiness.
[48.20] you are right Arooj, 
thank God.
[58.43] What do we have to be happy about, 
and what we don’t have to be happy about,
[67.53] at times a person is unable to 
differentiate between this.
[82.10] When a person suffers at 
the hands of the situation,
[86.13] then they even forget 
how to respect.
[94.03] But you have brought me up 
in tough conditions, papa.
[103.73] No matter how the condition,
[106.03] I cannot forget respect.
[109.83] Anyway, leave it, 
what are you talking about?
[112.10] Here you go. Have sweets.
[114.10] Yes, give it to me.
[118.60] Mama, sweets?
[138.07] That’s it,
[139.17] now we have to move on in life.
[145.70] For ourselves. For Areej.
[152.97] Everything will be fine.
[155.90] Yes, mama,
[159.60] I got an advance salary.
[161.77] I have kept the money 
in the cupboard.
[166.87] I have kept some money separately,
[169.90] we might need them.
[174.27] I will go give sweets to mama.
[184.47] May God protect her from 
the evil eye,
[186.90] and always keep her happy.
[201.33] Money has a lot of power.
[210.30] I mean,
[212.67] money itself is a big power.
[218.87] What do you think?
[221.63] We cannot argue on this, 
you are 100% correct.
[228.67] By the way,
[230.57] now those people don’t even
have money to buy poison.
[240.33] The old man is already injured,
[242.20] and even if he was not injured,
[247.87] he was not capable 
to earn money.
[251.50] No, no, no, Salman, 
don’t think this at all.
[259.67] He is a big strength for 
Arooj right now,
[269.67] and till the time a person has 
their own around them,
[271.90] they don’t fall weak.
[273.93] The old man has good luck,
[275.87] he got saved at my hands that day.
[278.63] That’s fine, but we shouldn’t 
take them easy.
[286.77] You understand me, right?
[288.67] Yes.
[290.80] By the way,
[292.50] I met aunt Mehreen, 
I forgot to tell you.
[296.23] So?
[298.13] Nothing, the same emotional drama, 
emotional talk.
[307.67] I didn’t give her a lot of importance.
[311.33] She is a really cunning woman. 
Really cunning.
[316.10] I feel
[318.23] Arooj gave her a lesson 
and sent her.
[325.87] No, issues,
[327.67] both mother and daughter will 
come in a few days
[332.23] and apologize to us.
[354.40] You couldn’t recognize 
these eyes, right?
[357.97] I went crazy crying 
in your memory.
[362.63] I am your mother.
[366.00] I have brought you up.
[369.47] I have done your upbringing.
[371.03] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything.
[372.57] But I want to talk to you Salman.
[378.97] I want to talk.
[384.27] I didn’t bring you up like this,
[388.50] that you stop caring about people.
[395.13] And that you only become 
the slave of your stubbornness.
[399.73] I didn’t bring you up like this.
[402.50] Why are you disturbing me? Huh?
[405.80] Disturb?
[408.97] We are disturbing you?
[412.93] You have disturbed all of us, Salman.
[448.83] Greetings sir.
[449.87] Is Nasir there?
[450.93] Yes, sir, he is in his room.
Okay.
[458.83] Ansa, don’t worry.
[460.47] I will talk to Mr. Nasir today
[462.63] and I have full hopes that 
he will appoint you.
[467.17] Because I know your accounts
 experience,
[469.70] we have worked together.
[471.53] So I hope that he will ask you 
to join from this month.
[475.57] Thank you, madam. 
I am really needy.
[477.80] I understand
[479.07] and I will try my best that 
you join us from this month.
[482.80] Okay, madam.
Thank you so much.
[581.70] Sister in law Arooj is taking care
of the new appointments,
[584.13] if she has given an approval then 
you can join from tomorrow.
[588.60] Thank you sir. 
You are welcome.
[591.17] You can leave.
[592.43] What have you done?
[597.47] Salman, come, 
we will sit and talk.
[599.97] What is Arooj doing in your office?
[603.73] What is Arooj doing in your office?
Answer me.
[608.40] Sure.
[609.83] She is my sister in law.
[612.50] Whatever relation you had with 
her was because of me.
[618.70] Now my relation is no more, then 
what relation are you living up to?
[622.37] Salman,
[625.17] you are being emotional
 for no reason.
[627.00] The situation is not that bad, 
that you don’t have a way to go back.
[630.73] Who wants to go back? Huh?
[632.57] And what do you think? 
Whatever happened is just time pass?
[634.80] Everything will be fine as earlier?
[638.43] There is just one relation left 
between me and Arooj
[642.03] and that is enmity.
[647.23] Whoever will support her 
will be my enemy.
[653.07] How can you doubt my friendship,
man?
[655.23] I am surely doubting you.
[657.03] You are supporting my enemy and
 I don’t even doubt your friendship.
[661.03] there is nothing like that, Salman?
[662.73] Really? Then come fire her.
[667.10] Fire her.
[670.07] I cannot do that.
[675.23] I cannot do injustice with 
anyone else because of you.
[679.27] I am really sorry for that.
[689.67] I think you are forgetting 
who you are saying no to.
[696.23] I know.
[698.40] You don’t know. 
You don’t know at all.
[706.23] Whatever I do with
 Arooj is separate,
[710.77] but you have no idea
[716.33] what I can do with you.
[721.83] Are you threatening me, Salman?
[724.53] Absolutely.
[727.37] Is this you, Salman?
[729.93] My childhood friend?
[732.00] You are threatening me?
[734.13] All relations are based on loss 
and benefit.
[737.27] Here no one belongs to anyone.
[743.47] There is still time, 
think about it or else…
[748.43] Or else what will you do?
[751.73] This office of yours works 
on my tenders.
[757.37] I will take back all the tenders 
and you will fall to the ground.
[762.03] Salman, maybe the company 
will stand up again,
[766.57] but the way you have fallen 
from my eyes today,
[770.43] maybe you will never be 
able to get up.
[776.73] You can do what you want.
[779.47] Sister in law Arooj will do 
a job here.
[785.30] That’s the way to leave.
[797.23] It will cost you a lot.
[804.40] It will cost you a lot.
[835.10] By the way, 
how was her interview?
[838.43] So, so, but she was not up to 
the requirements of the company,
[844.80] so I rejected her.
[850.37] What do you mean, 
you rejected her?
[852.87] Are you crazy?
[854.70] You rejected such a pretty girl?
[858.07] Oh hello,
[860.60] my dear friend Salman Waqar.
[863.73] This company doesn’t need 
pretty and beautiful girls.
[867.40] It needs intelligent and 
skilful girls.
[870.37] After all, I have already hired 
someone for this post.
[876.73] But this girl, what is her name?
[881.83] Arooj.
[883.17] She is very, very, educated and
sincere to her work.
[887.37] But I am sorry.
[890.27] You call Arooj tomorrow.
[892.63] I am telling you,
[894.13] your business will grow 
because of Arooj.
[897.23] Call her tomorrow.
[1007.67] If you take Areej from here, 
I will kill you.
[1012.03] You will kill me?
[1014.07] Kill me.
[1019.00] Kill me. Shoot.
[1021.63] Why don’t you shoot? 
Murder me.
[1024.40] Tell Areej
[1027.03] that a mother sacrificed her life 
for her daughter.
[1030.20] Shoot.
[1031.53] Come on, shoot.
[1033.63] Hey, leave it. 
Coward.
[1035.70] How will you shoot someone?
[1039.27] It will cost you a lot to take Areej.
[1042.57] I am not a businessperson 
like you people,
[1045.10] that I will account for cheap 
and expensive.
[1047.80] I am a mother.
[1049.23] If you take Areej from here, 
you will have to face a lot of loss.
[1053.43] I will divorce you.
[1054.93] You can do what you want.
[1124.87] Brother Nasir, is everything fine?
[1128.77] Is the file complete, sister in law?
[1131.10] Yes.
[1237.43] Why don’t you understand, Naseema,
[1241.40] they are really dangerous and 
powerful people.
[1252.50] We cannot go to war with them.
[1256.80] They will make our life hell 
in this city.
[1271.80] What do you think?
[1275.53] Will they let any ease come 
in Arooj’s life?
[1288.67] Never.
[1290.50] Never, Naseema. Never.
[1294.33] So, Master,
[1296.27] should we sit at home out 
of their fear?
[1310.20] Should we leave this city and go?
[1312.90] When we cannot go to war 
with them,
[1317.93] then what is the harm in sitting at 
home and leaving the city and going?
[1333.00] They will make my daughter’s life
tougher, than tough.
[1338.97] Master,
[1342.47] the one who has no one,
[1345.70] God is with them.
[1348.57] You don’t lose hope.
[1351.27] Just pray to God
[1356.60] that HE protects us from 
the evil of the enemy.
[1383.53] I will go make soup for you.
[1410.23] When you cannot handle the bike,
[1411.77] then why do you bring it on 
the road at this age?
[1413.80] Do you see, 
you put a dent in my car?
[1417.57] You are right, Salman.
[1419.90] It is my fault.
[1424.67] You want to embarrass me 
by saying all this, right?
[1427.00] Like it is all my fault and 
you didn’t do anything.
[1428.90] That’s how it is, right?
[1430.20] No, there is nothing like that, 
I came to talk to you.
[1434.93] When I have told you that 
I don’t want to talk to you,
[1437.70] then why are you after me
like a beggar?
[1439.77] Go from here.
[1442.63] You are right,
[1444.47] the father of the girl is a beggar 
in front of a rich son in law.
[1449.90] Don’t speak too many dialogues 
in front of me.
[1452.63] Guards, pick up his bike and 
take it into custody.
[1455.27] Till the time he doesn’t pay up, 
he will not get his bike.
[1460.60] Oh my God,
[1464.20] keep my daughter in 
Your protection.
[1469.17] Protect her, my Lord.
[1472.80] Make things easy for her.
[1478.97] Make it easy for her.
[1493.40] I have ruined it?
[1496.53] How dare you say something
so useless to me?
[1500.27] Actually,
[1502.13] Areej is also with you,
[1504.87] so Arooj is crying continuously.
[1508.97] Have mercy on her.
[1512.90] There is still time.
[1515.53] Leave from here, or else I will have
 the guard drag you out.
[1520.47] Don’t do that.
[1522.27] My daughter will go mad.
[1525.13] Really?
[1527.47] So, she is your daughter?
[1531.67] With what relation?
[1535.37] You can say anything you want,
[1537.87] but don’t separate Areej and Arooj
from you. Please.
[1545.57] Don’t try to dictate me.
[1550.70] Get out of here.
[1586.20] She is my sister in law.
[1588.53] Whatever relation you had with her
was because of me.
[1593.00] Now my relation is no more, then, 
what relation are you living up to?
[1596.73] Salman,
[1599.43] you are being emotional 
for no reason.
[1601.30] The situation is not that bad, that
 you don’t have a way to go back.
[1605.13] Who wants to go back? Huh?
[1606.90] And what do you think? Whatever
 happened is just time pass?
[1609.07] Everything will be fine as earlier?
[1612.90] There is just one relation left 
between me and Arooj
[1616.30] and that is enmity.
[1620.27] Whoever will support her 
will be my enemy.
[1626.20] How can you doubt my friendship, 
man?
[1628.30] I am surely doubting you.
[1630.03] You are supporting my enemy and
I don’t even doubt your friendship.
[1634.00] there is nothing like that,
Salman?
[1635.77] Really?
[1637.63] Then come fire her.
[1640.13] Fire her.
[1643.10] I cannot do that.
[1651.17] I cannot do injustice with 
anyone else because of you.
[1655.30] I am really sorry for that.
[1666.07] Man, Salman, you don’t like it, right?
[1675.00] I feel you want to worry them more.
[1679.77] Don’t you and mom want this?
[1683.60] Forget me, son,
[1692.27] but it is Shaista’s dream that 
we ruin Mehreen and Arooj.
[1707.40] Now see how both of them 
are staying with Master.
[1714.37] What should we do?
[1716.93] I want to ruin Arooj.
[1721.87] Look son,
[1723.87] it is not easy to reach the queen bee.
[1736.77] In fact, think that it is impossible.
[1754.00] The bees that love the queen always
have a protective circle around her.
[1767.13] Even if they lose their life in this.
[1772.87] So what is done, then?
[1775.10] Smoke.
[1776.47] Smoke, son.
[1785.33] Spread so much smoke,
[1787.97] that the bees are unable to see
[1797.53] and they start worrying 
about themselves.
[1803.20] I want to single out the queen bee.
[1806.37] Yes,
[1808.33] now you get it.
[1831.83] Are you threatening me, Salman?
[1834.47] Absolutely.
[1837.23] Is this you, Salman?
[1839.93] My childhood friend?
[1842.10] You are threatening me?
[1844.17] All relations are based on loss 
and benefit.
[1847.33] Here no one belongs to anyone.
[1851.77] There is still time, 
think about it or else…
[1856.73] Or else what will you do?
[1859.93] This office of yours works 
on my tenders.
[1865.37] I will take back all the tenders and
you will fall to the ground.
[1870.27] Salman, maybe the company 
will stand up again,
[1874.87] but the way you have fallen 
from my eyes today,
[1878.63] maybe you will never be
able to get up.
[1882.57] You can do what you want.
[1885.43] Sister-in-law, Arooj will do a job here.
[1891.27] That’s the way to leave.
[1919.87] Don’t worry, my sister.
[1933.03] No matter how long the days
of difficulty are,
[1936.30] the evening of comfort surely comes.
[1943.77] Master,
[1945.93] I too have complete faith.
[1958.57] Good times will surely come.
