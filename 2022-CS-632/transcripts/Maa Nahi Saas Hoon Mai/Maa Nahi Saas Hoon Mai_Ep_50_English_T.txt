[47.88] Hey, I couldn’t find one medication,
[51.08] I looked around the
 city and brought it.
[53.40] Now you get well soon.
[57.60] I am fine, master.
[60.92] You tell me,
[64.32] did you tell Arooj anything?
[69.12] She was calling me 
again and again,
[72.52] so out of helplessness 
I told her for her satisfaction.
[77.12] You didn’t do good,
[80.32] she must be worried
 without a reason.
[95.92] What are you thinking now?
[97.80] I am thinking,
[100.56] what else have we given to
 Arooj apart from worries?
[107.88] Why did this thought 
come to your head?
[110.68] You get such thoughts, master.
[116.92] I feel we decided to 
marry Arooj in a haste.
[128.92] And this is our biggest mistake.
[131.84] We made this decision 
for Arooj’s betterment.
[137.52] But maybe,
[140.88] we couldn’t make 
the right decision.
[148.76] We should have investigated 
Salman’s family along with him.
[164.92] Now one thing will 
always pinch me.
[170.32] What?
[215.36] If Arooj was our real daughter,
[229.48] still would we have handed her
 over to such a mother in law?
[252.04] Naseema, you surprise me.
[255.28] What is the reason
[257.44] to worry yourself today
 for the sorrow of the past?
[262.12] And what is the need 
to think this right now?
[264.72] There is a need.
[267.72] I feel
[269.68] we have really done injustice to Arooj, 
knowingly or unknowingly.
[283.56] What injustice?
[284.92] We married her in a home
[289.04] where she is being tortured constantly.
[292.00] Meaning,
[293.08] if Arooj was our own daughter,
[295.76] we wouldn’t have fixed this proposal?
[309.48] Master,
[312.44] if you drop something 
delicate and it breaks,
[321.72] then you feel sorrow.
[331.72] But there is no fear of 
being answerable.
[335.76] Hey, who do we have to answer to
[338.00] and why do we have to answer.
[340.28] We don’t doubt the sincerity of our love.
[343.88] We found Arooj,
[345.72] we kept her close to our heart.
[355.60] We didn’t have a daughter of our own.
[358.48] We gave Arooj all the love.
[361.48] We brought her up.
[373.84] Now Arooj is our daughter.
[448.20] Master, I feel Arooj is here.
[460.48] No, there is no one.
[461.88] The door is closed.
[472.64] Okay, I am getting water for you,
[475.20] quickly have your medication.
[489.76] If Arooj was our real daughter,
[496.08] still would we have handed her 
over to such a mother in law?
[508.72] Meaning,
[509.88] if Arooj was our own daughter,
[512.48] we wouldn’t have fixed
 this proposal?
[562.12] If the wife loves her husband,
[565.08] it is not called trapping him.
[570.16] But when the son forgets 
her mother,
[573.24] only belongs to his wife,
[574.68] then it is called trapping the son.
[579.36] Now how do I respond to
 this question of yours?
[583.84] You have an answer, 
but you will not give it,
[588.28] because you are more
 cunning that I can think.
[592.40] I am surprised.
[594.48] You consider my acumen, 
ingeniousness
[596.76] and my love as cunningness.
[613.36] She had fainted,
[614.52] she just came home
 from the hospital
[616.24] and all this happened 
because of you.
[618.40] Be quiet.
[620.12] Do you know what 
you are saying?
[621.76] I know well what I am saying.
[624.72] you know,
[625.80] I had made an image of 
yours in front of my mother,
[629.16] and you ruined that image.
[631.80] My mother’s patience also broke.
[634.68] She heard everything today.
[641.80] She can hear it if she wants.
[643.84] I am not afraid of your mother.
[646.92] You can at least respect her.
[649.20] She is my mother.
[652.36] Your mother is not unique.
[658.96] My mother is everything for me,
[664.40] and in future, don’t 
say a word for her.
[677.00] The faith of this Arooj is
[687.12] now touching the heights
 of misbehaviour.
[697.92] She now has started to consider
 herself the owner of this home.
[706.28] I will stop her from using 
this fearless tone.
[716.20] She thinks that this 
Mehreen knows nothing.
[727.72] But she doesn’t know
[731.16] that now it is time.
[738.04] I will show her 
my true colours.
[767.48] What is the reason
[769.48] to worry yourself today for 
the sorrow of the past?
[774.04] And what is the need 
to think this right now?
[776.84] There is a need.
[779.76] I feel
[781.64] we have really done injustice to Arooj,
 knowingly or unknowingly.
[788.24] What injustice?
[789.64] We married her in a home
[793.72] where she is being
 tortured constantly.
[796.68] Meaning,
[797.80] if Arooj was our own daughter,
[800.48] we wouldn’t have fixed 
this proposal?
[809.20] Who am I?
[813.92] Arooj?
[816.64] No.
[822.08] This introduction 
is incomplete for me.
[829.68] Whose daughter am I?
[838.24] if they are not my parents, then…
[847.96] then who are my parents?
[860.56] Who will answer these
 questions of mine?
[870.88] Who will I ask?
[879.32] How can I ask the parents who brought
 me up with so much love,
[886.96] who am I?
[894.44] Who am I and who are they?
[906.68] No,
[909.12] I will not ask anyone,
[913.52] nor will I tell anyone.
[917.52] Because there is nothing to ask,
[920.88] nor is there anything to ask.
[936.64] How can you think so 
mercilessly, Mehreen?
[940.88] Do you not feel mercy on Arooj .
[946.80] If she speaks the truth, 
you think it is a lie.
[949.52] If her mother is unwell,
[951.00] you think it is a drama.
[958.20] Is all this fine?
[960.28] Is this the right behaviour?
[962.44] She lies sister in law.
[967.00] How do I believe her?
[968.88] She used her mother’s 
health as an excuse
[970.76] and is sitting at her mother’s home.
[974.32] So what do you think?
[976.28] Even her mother is lying?
[981.72] She is doing a drama
 of being unwell?
[983.72] Yes,
[985.16] it is absolutely possible.
[986.68] Oh my God.
[989.16] Mehreen, how much hatred 
do you have for Arooj in your heart?
[996.64] You didn’t like Arooj from day one,
[999.24] only because she is not yours,
[1001.72] but Salman’s choice, right?
[1005.84] Such a girl cannot be
 my choice, sister in law.
[1011.16] Even if she is Salman’s choice?
[1014.68] Salman is inexperienced,
[1019.76] he is stupid
[1021.08] and I will not let people take 
advantage of these stupidities of his.
[1024.92] Salman is my life.
[1026.76] I love everything about him.
[1028.44] But I don’t love his love, sister in law.
[1032.64] But that child loves you, Mehreen.
[1035.80] She doesn’t sister in law.
[1037.72] It is all a lie.
[1039.00] If she loved me,
[1040.56] then she would have 
respected me too.
[1045.60] If you also find out what 
she said to me,
[1049.04] then maybe you too 
will believe me.
[1051.48] Really?
[1052.76] What did she say?
[1054.32] Tell me. Tell me.
[1057.80] We will talk about that in front
 of everyone, sister in law.
[1064.52] And it will especially be done 
in Salman’s presence.
[1095.68] But Salman is not ready to 
accept anything I say as correct 
and as the truth.
[1102.20] According to you,
[1104.24] Salman only listens to Mehreen.
[1108.80] So child why do you worry
 yourself thinking this?
[1114.92] Because I cannot separate 
this thought from myself.
[1118.00] Why?
[1124.28] Aunt Mehreen is pushing 
me in a quicksand.
[1130.52] Despite making a lot of attempts,
[1133.68] I am getting stuck in that
 quicksand, aunt.
[1136.92] What do I do?
[1180.12] Aunty, where is Arooj? I don’t see her.
[1182.92] Arooj?
[1184.92] Arooj didn’t come here.
[1186.92] She didn’t come here?
[1189.72] But she told me on the phone that
[1192.28] she was coming to ask how you are.
[1196.44] Son, Salman, did she say that?
[1200.76] Then why didn’t she come here?
[1205.48] I don’t know.
[1226.20] What happened, son?
[1228.48] Her phone is off.
[1245.96] Greetings. Wasai, where is Arooj?
[1251.96] What?
[1253.88] For the past two hours?
[1256.08] But where?
[1261.24] Yes, but she didn’t come here.
[1266.52] Okay fine, I will ask.
[1273.92] Okay aunty, I will go now.
[1276.28] Hey Salman, where is Arooj?
[1279.96] I think she went to a friend.
[1281.92] Okay. Okay fine.
[1284.28] When she comes, do send her to me.
[1288.92] Sure, aunty.
[1290.60] In fact, I will bring her with me.
[1293.68] You are really good.
[1295.56] You really care for Arooj.
[1298.16] But…
[1301.08] But what aunty?
[1304.48] She is really happy with you,
[1307.52] but she is not happy in that home, son.
[1312.04] There is nothing like that aunty,
[1314.04] there are ups and downs in every home.
[1318.32] You are right.
[1320.56] Okay, you take care. I will go.
[1323.28] Fine, son. You go. Goodbye.
[1325.28] Goodbye.
[1485.88] Hey, who do we have to answer to
[1488.04] and why do we have to answer.
[1490.36] We don’t doubt the sincerity of our love.
[1494.04] We found Arooj,
[1495.84] we kept her close to our heart.
[1498.80] We didn’t have a daughter of our own.
[1501.72] We gave Arooj all the love.
[1504.68] We brought her up.
[1507.76] Now Arooj is our daughter.
[1520.56] You have a noise inside you
[1524.60] and I have a noise inside me.
[1530.08] But there is so much 
difference between the two.
[1535.44] You can express your noise 
with full intensity,
[1541.16] and me?
[1691.48] Hello Arooj.
[1693.20] Hey, you surprise me.
[1695.40] I have been calling 
you for so long,
[1697.00] your phone is off.
[1704.24] Okay tell me, where are you?
[1706.68] There, at the same place,
[1709.44] where I talk to myself, alone.
[1713.36] But why did you go there alone?
[1719.20] I am alone.
[1721.88] Arooj, why do you consider 
yourself alone?
[1725.12] I am with you.
[1727.96] You know, Salman,
[1730.80] at times
[1732.28] a person feels alone even 
when they are with everyone.
[1739.44] This means there is 
something special.
[1741.72] Won’t you tell me?
[1749.52] There is nothing to tell you.
[1752.16] Okay, you wait, I am coming there.
[1967.40] Hey Naseema,
[1970.04] the doctor told you to rest,
[1973.12] why did you come out?
[1975.64] Salman, came over.
[1978.12] Salman came?
[1980.36] Then why did you leave so early?
[1983.52] And he didn’t drop Arooj
 with you either.
[1987.36] Arooj didn’t come.
[1989.60] What do you mean?
[1990.60] Arooj didn’t come?
[1992.96] So you should have asked Salman.
[1995.64] Even he doesn’t know.
[1997.40] Huh?
[1999.48] Even he doesn’t know
 where Arooj is?
[2001.72] Then where is Arooj?
[2005.12] Master, he was worried himself.
[2013.64] What are you thinking?
[2017.60] Arooj found out about your ailment,
[2021.80] still she didn’t come to see you.
[2025.92] There must have been
 some issue with Mehreen.
[2032.32] That’s it,
[2034.16] she would be lying somewhere
 with her mobile switched off.
[2037.64] If there was some issue there,
[2039.72] she should have come here.
[2044.80] If some issue happens 
with daughters,
[2047.28] they should come to
 their parents’ home.
[2051.48] What can I say?
[2055.08] I don’t know what situation 
my daughter would be going through.
[2060.16] Okay come on,
[2061.16] it is time for your medication,
[2063.24] get up. Come.
[2068.80] Careful.
[2113.88] Arooj.
[2121.48] What are you doing here?
[2126.84] You didn’t go to meet aunty Naseema,
[2128.56] your phone was off
[2130.20] and you are standing here alone?
[2137.16] I am alone, so I will stand alone.
[2141.72] What is the matter, Arooj?
[2147.84] Nothing.
[2151.00] There is something.
[2153.68] Tell me.
[2166.64] When there is nothing to tell you, 
then what will I tell?
[2170.56] Did mama say something?
[2179.80] She often says one thing or the other.
[2184.32] What is new in that?
[2189.16] But you know, Salman,
[2193.44] her saying anything or talking 
about something doesn’t bother me.
[2199.28] Then what is the reason
[2202.12] that you need to be alone like this?
[2206.96] The guesses you are 
making to find out what it is,
[2212.44] maybe you won’t be able 
to know it.
[2218.96] Because maybe I too just
 found out about this.
[2226.88] Look,
[2229.12] if there is anything you 
can share it with me.
[2232.52] I can hear it.
[2241.64] Okay come on, let’s go.
[2243.12] Where?
[2245.88] To meet your mother.
