[21.92] How will we manage these matters
 of the court?
[27.76] Have you thought about it?
[29.32] What do you mean how will 
they be managed?
[32.40] They say that
[34.44] if you want to go the hospital 
and court,
[37.80] then you should not carry money
in your pocket,
[40.68] you should take bags full of it.
[45.28] Now where will we got so much 
money from, Master?
[48.92] God will make a way.
[52.04] God makes all the way.
[54.92] Now, you don’t earn 
that much pension,
[58.72] now we have more people 
at home as well.
[61.12] There has been an addition 
of three people.
[64.28] Why three?
[65.92] Areej is really young right now.
[72.80] Areej’s expense is the most.
[81.92] Her milk is really costly.
[85.84] A box of five thousand runs out 
in five days.
[100.04] I am bored staying at home.
[104.40] Mr. Sadiq has told me repeatedly
 to join his school,
[110.92] I think I will join him.
[121.96] Your health isn’t stable.
[126.00] Will you do a job in this age?
[128.88] What happened to my health?
[131.00] I am fit.
[139.40] What can be done staying at home?
[158.44] You have tea.
[214.68] Areej’s expense is the most.
[218.44] Her milk is really costly.
[222.48] A box of five thousand runs out 
in five days.
[234.60] I am bored staying at home.
[239.08] Mr. Sadiq has told me repeatedly 
to join his school,
[245.56] I think I will join him.
[251.08] Your health isn’t stable.
[255.12] Will you do a job in this age?
[258.04] What happened to my health?
[260.24] I am fit.
[268.60] What can be done staying at home?
[278.04] Papa, you know
[280.96] when I was taking care of 
Salman’s office,
[284.08] I got to learn a lot there.
[287.28] You child, that is true.
[289.32] A person learns a lot by working.
[291.92] Yes,
[293.04] if they sit at home,
[294.96] then the education they got 
goes to waste.
[297.32] That is also true.
[303.88] I was thinking that
[309.84] why don’t I do a job?
[314.64] It is a weird coincidence, child.
[317.20] I am also thinking of doing a job,
[319.64] and you too are thinking of 
doing a job.
[328.52] But this cannot happen.
[336.40] You will not do a job.
[338.68] Why won’t I?
[340.36] Because I will do the job.
[342.72] I will do it.
[344.92] Okay, let’s do one thing, 
we will have a toss.
[347.04] Whoever wins will do a job.
[348.84] No. We are not having a toss.
[350.56] And it is decided that I will do a job,
[352.76] and swear to me you will 
not say anything.
[368.88] Okay fine.
[370.56] Now you made me swear on you, 
so what else can I say?
[381.00] But what will happen to Areej?
[383.12] Areej?
[384.24] Nothing will happen to her.
[385.60] She has two grandmothers 
they will take care of her.
[391.40] Fine. Okay fine.
[394.36] Two grandmothers.
[396.16] That’s it, then it is decided.
[398.20] Okay fine.
[467.48] Papa you just have your tea, 
then we will go.
[470.20] Okay.
[471.04] Arooj, child, have breakfast.
[473.60] You will not leave without having tea.
[475.96] No mama, I am not hungry at all.
[478.16] Okay, I will have tea.
[482.24] You have always skipped breakfast.
[485.44] Since the time you were young and 
used to go to school.
[493.52] Naseema, would quietly put your 
lunch box in your bag.
[500.68] Yes, and when I would come home,
[502.68] mama would see the lunch box and
 I wouldn’t have touched it.
[506.12] Then Naseema would get upset
[507.96] and you would quickly finish your 
lunch and show her.
[512.12] Then mama and I would become 
friends again.
[516.88] Yes. Come on, child, 
you will get late.
[519.44] You should reach thirty minutes 
before time on the interview day.
[522.80] Hey, hey, wait. What is wrong?
[525.52] Have a piece of sandwich Arooj.
[528.24] Oh ho, here,
[530.24] I have taken it. 
Happy now?
[531.84] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[533.32] Goodbye.
[730.88] Yes, child, how was your interview?
[734.04] It was fine, papa.
[735.44] What do you think?
[737.08] Will they give you a job?
[738.36] Your daughter is really capable.
[740.48] They are asking me to join 
from tomorrow.
[744.40] So are you joining from tomorrow?
[747.96] No,
[749.96] they are offering a really 
low salary package.
[754.96] Okay fine,
[757.12] you will find a good job somewhere.
[759.80] Shall we go now? 
This is enough for today.
[763.28] Okay?
Fine.
[884.08] I will take care of everything, 
I will do it myself,
[886.32] this is what you had said, right?
[889.00] Then what happened?
[890.84] What happened? 
Nothing happened.
[899.24] And whatever happened was wrong.
[901.72] You will not be able to do anything 
and we will get exposed.
[913.08] We will get punished for the thing 
that we didn’t do
[916.08] If you speak so loudly,
I won’t understand anything.
[919.48] You had sent those shooters, right?
[921.16] Yes, so? What happened?
[922.60] They were really cheap shooters.
[925.04] They shot at someone and 
someone else got shot.
[938.68] But, how did you get this news?
[943.40] Nasir went to the hospital 
to meet someone.
[952.12] He told me that he met Arooj.
[960.20] Master Shoaib got shot.
[969.40] Where? Where did he get shot?
[971.48] I don’t know where he got shot,
[973.56] but Arooj didn’t even get a scratch.
[1000.88] Now you must be calling 
those shooters, right?
[1006.28] Very good. Very nice.
[1017.88] Those shooters will get caught,
[1019.44] the police will get your call record
[1021.04] and then the police will come catch you.
Is this what you want?
[1033.52] Do you still think you will 
take care of this matter?
[1040.08] You won’t be able to do anything,
and that Arooj will dance on our heads.
[1046.24] How is this possible?
[1047.56] She has good fate; Arooj won’t be 
saved every time.
[1055.80] Will someone tell me,
[1063.24] what is going on?
[1073.48] What are you two doing?
[1076.24] Tell me as well, 
I too should find out.
[1078.92] You too hear it out,
[1080.68] and show us the amazing 
feat you can achieve.
[1083.80] What tone are you talking to me in?
[1089.88] Mom, dad’s plan failed.
[1092.44] Arooj survived.
[1109.88] I don’t know when this Arooj 
will have her downfall.
[1120.48] Once she leaves, 
our life will be at peace.
[1125.16] I don’t know what will happen.
[1144.92] I am the owner of this business, 
property, wealth
[1152.76] and I have learned this well.
[1158.92] So, my advice to you is to stop 
dreaming about this.
[1166.16] It is just a matter of me
going to court,
[1170.72] the game you planned for 
twenty five years
[1177.16] will be destroyed in minutes.
[1181.24] So, the meaning of all this is
[1185.04] that stay away from my husband,
my daughter and my mother’s life.
[1190.88] This has your betterment in it.
[1219.00] We kept on being worried here,
[1221.40] why did you people not 
tell us anything?
[1223.72] Had I told you two as well,
[1226.28] then you two would have 
gotten worried too.
[1230.00] Thank God,
[1231.72] He blessed us.
[1244.72] Master,
[1246.60] God gave you a second life.
[1254.08] This is because of the prayers 
of you people,
[1256.60] or else the one who tried to kill me, 
tried his best.
[1280.56] And he had bled a lot too, mama.
[1288.56] Thank God,
[1290.08] brother Nasir’s friends made 
immediate arrangement.
[1297.52] So, if the position was such,
[1300.32] then why did you people
 come home?
[1306.68] Papa was in a hurry to come home.
[1308.84] The doctor told him to stay admitted
in the hospital.
[1316.44] I would have gotten admitted 
in the hospital, Naseema,
[1322.76] but do you have any idea how much 
it would have cost?
[1346.92] I will get the dressing done at home 
for two to four days, I will be fine.
[1350.92] Okay, tell me,
[1354.08] did the doctor tell you to follow some 
diet because of the wound.
[1357.88] Hey, nothing special. 
Nothing.
[1361.24] Then I will go make soup for you.
[1363.36] Hey, leave…
[1364.44] Hey, what are you doing?
Master.
[1369.28] Don’t move your hand, 
your wound is still fresh.
[1372.52] You lie down comfortably, 
I will bring it for you.
[1404.88] Papa, you won’t move now.
[1408.84] All of you got a chance 
to order me around.
[1412.44] I won’t move.
[1450.76] And I had an idea,
he would go there,
[1453.24] so I went there following him.
[1458.36] What is wrong with you?
[1460.64] Why did you go there?
[1466.04] What did Salman do?
[1468.92] He did what he had done earlier too.
[1473.32] In fact, maybe
[1475.20] this time he did something 
even more dangerous.
[1480.16] Oh God, be kind.
[1482.20] What did Salman do?
[1485.56] He hit papa’s motorcycle with his car.
[1490.76] Thank God, there was no big accident.
[1494.80] hey, he didn’t hit on purpose.
[1501.44] It was just a coincidence.
[1503.72] Papa, why don’t you say
[1505.84] that he tried to kill you?
[1546.28] I have taken out all the information.
[1552.48] Nothing happened to Master Shoaib.
[1554.80] He has even gone home.
[1557.44] Master Shoaib, wasn’t even our target.
[1560.80] What are you saying? 
Huh?
[1569.32] Master Shoaib is Arooj’s biggest strength.
[1572.32] She does everything with his advice.
[1579.92] This entire family has become
 a problem for us.
[1585.28] If we would have gotten rid of 
Master Shoaib,
[1588.68] Arooj would have become weak.
[1598.80] Master will get scared now.
[1600.60] How will he get scared?
[1603.80] Shaista is right,
[1606.64] we will have to think ten times 
before making any plan,
[1608.92] anything can happen.
[1612.76] You know, you people surprise me.
[1615.16] I mean, you people made such a 
big plan to just scare master Shoaib.
[1619.68] This is the limit.
[1621.96] Don’t worry,
[1623.40] it won’t happen this time. Yes.
[1632.60] I don’t think so.
[1638.16] Anyway,
[1639.72] we will have to face the consequences 
of what we have done.
[1760.72] Salman.
[1762.52] Son, what happened?
How did this happen?
[1765.04] Son, Salman, is everything okay?
Are you fine?
[1767.52] Yes, uncle, I am fine.
[1769.60] Actually, two people came on a bike
and they shot me.
[1780.64] Thank God, I am fine now.
[1782.60] Did you file a report with the police?
[1784.88] Yes, mom.
[1793.04] You did the right thing. 
You did the right thing.
[1795.84] Okay, don’t worry, I am fine. 
Nothing happened.
[1800.60] Idrees,
[1801.84] get a black goat quickly and 
do charity for my Salman.
[1805.24] Yes. Yes.
[1806.44] Wasai, bring turmeric milk.
Go quickly.
[1809.52] Yes.
[1811.48] Come on. 
Come inside.
[1813.12] Yes, son. 
Careful.
[1815.96] Does it hurt a lot?
[1817.40] Do you have pain?
Huh?
[1818.92] Don’t worry, I am fine.
[1870.08] I don’t have proof for this,
[1876.60] that uncle Idrees got this attack done.
[1885.88] But I have no reason to reject this,
[1894.64] that all this was not done by uncle.
[1920.12] Arooj.
[1928.48] What are you thinking?
[1933.36] I am thinking that
[1937.20] papa knows everything 
about this attack.
[1949.44] But I don’t know why,
[1952.68] he doesn’t want to say anything 
about this.
[1956.08] Yes, Arooj.
[1958.60] Master didn’t say a word a single 
moment of this incident.
[1965.28] and maybe he doesn’t want to 
talk about this because
[1969.28] he feels that his daughter Arooj 
will start disliking his in-laws.
