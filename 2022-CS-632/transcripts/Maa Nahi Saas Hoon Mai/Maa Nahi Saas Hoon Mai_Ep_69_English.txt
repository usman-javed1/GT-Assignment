Yes, yes, fine. 
I understand. I understand.
I understand. Okay. What happened? Everything is fine in the office, right? The meeting got cancelled and 
I got blamed for it too. That deal didn’t get finalized, that’s why. So, then? Nothing. I have received a 
show cause notice. Don’t worry, all this will never happen. When all this will be ours. You are being overconfident, 
Shaista. No, I am preparing my soldier 
in the lines of the enemy. Now you don’t worry, everything will be done and our hands will also be clean. You are making me believe it, but don’t think of an idea like you 
thought of earlier. Just wait and watch. Sister in law, I had no hopes, she took the bowl from my hands 
happily and with love. You are really naïve, Mehreen and Arooj is cunning. What is the matter sister in law? You never spoke like this 
about Arooj earlier. What happened now? I made a mistake. I am so sorry. I got late in understanding her. Arooj is actually cunning. She along with Salman, wants to take over this home and 
the entire business. You are right, sister in law, I didn’t think of that. Salman, we will reach today, right? What do you mean? There is a lot of time till it closes. Meaning, the speed at which you are driving,
I feel we will reach after the mall closes. Arooj, you are too much. Look, I am driving the car really carefully. Don’t you know what the doctor say? It is our first baby, we will have to be really careful. Can I say something? Yes, go ahead. You are really good. No matter how much you give 
these damned cats, their stomach is never full. She was having the soup 
in such a manner. Maybe. Maybe that soup was not in 
younger madam’s fate, in fact, it was in the fate 
of this damned cat. Anyway, may God be kind. Where are you going, Arooj? One minute. Brother, do you have methi puri? Make one. Arooj, what are you doing?
You will get a sore throat. Hey, their methi puri 
is really good, I always have it from here. Okay fine, you eat. 
I will not eat it. You too will eat it. 
Okay one minute. I am telling you it is really delicious. Is it ready, brother? Hey, you will get unwell. Nothing happens. See,
how yummy it looks. Okay try one. No, I don’t want to have it,
you eat. Please. Please. Okay one, 
it is really delicious. Hmmm. This is really tasty. I had told you. Brother, make another one. Make one more. Just now you said
you don’t eat it. From today onwards special food 
will be made for little madam, and Wasai will make it 
with her own hands. After ages, the voice of a child will echo 
in this home. Wasai. Wasai. What is the matter? 
Why are you worried? What did you feed the cat? It is dead. It has foam coming out from 
her mouth. She is dead? What are you saying? You come and see yourself. This means, the soup had poison. But who gave this poison? Elder madam or madam? This is something dangerous. What do I do now? It is necessary for me to get 
to the real thing. I have been loyal to this family, I will not let anything wrong happen. Come on. Come. Show me. Come on. Despite mom’s strict tone, 
you were smiling. What is the matter? What happened? Are you jealous? I am not jealous. By the way, there was something. What? Your mood has changed but mom is the same. At times a person should make 
the first move and if you make the first move
 in love, you surely get a response 
in return. Hello Nasir. You know there is a limit 
to indifference. I live in this city No call, no messages. I am really sorry, man, 
I was really busy. By the way, there is good news
for you. Wow. Good news? And you are telling me 
when I called you. I am really disappointed Salman. Okay, man, stop fighting. 
Listen to me. Tell me. You are going to be a uncle. What? Man, this is actually a really 
good news. There is another good news. Arooj has accepted mom. Now her scolding her doesn’t 
make a difference to her. See, how everything is getting 
fine gradually. Congratulations Salman. When we meet we will talk 
on this topic in detail. Congratulate sister in law Arooj
on this from me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Salman, we will reach today, right? What do you mean? There is a lot of time till it closes. Meaning, the speed at which you are driving,
I feel we will reach after the mall closes. Arooj, you are too much. Look, I am driving the car really carefully. Don’t you know what the doctor say? It is our first baby, we will have to be really careful. Can I say something? Yes, go ahead. You are really good. Have you thought if Mehreen finds out 
that Arooj is her daughter, Areej, then where will we stand? How many lies will be uncovered 
with this one truth? Nothing will happen. You just be smart instead of 
being emotional. Use your head. I don’t have so much time that I think,
 I act in my senses. It will not take a minute for this 
whole game to get spoiled, and that one minute can also 
be the next minute. Telling the truth is not that easy, 
you just wait for the opportunity. Removing Arooj from our way 
is our helplessness, not our greatness. The great thing would be that 
she has no proof left with her. Aunt. I came to show you something. Do you know, I have shopped 
for the baby today? And seriously, it is really difficult 
to shop for children. I will show you. I found such cute clothes.
See this. Pink colour and I got something
in yellow colour. I got green colour. Did you like them? Only you are there in this home,
who is happy in my happiness. Should I show you the shoes?
You will find them really cute. Come here. All this looks so beautiful,
right, Salman? It looks beautiful, right? Really beautiful. You will see our child will be way more 
beautiful than this. You know, Salman, 
you are really good. Really? How is that? Because you love the relation that 
has not come in this world so much. And the day he will be in your arms, how happy would you be? Every mother and father love 
their child the same. And children love the parents. Like you love and like I love. Will you have coffee? Why not? I will bring it. Are you feeling okay? Yes, I am fine. Why do you think this? I will have these thoughts everyday
 till the delivery. God will make it all fine. A mother sacrifices so much 
for her children. The children can never repay 
the favours of their mother. You are right, there is no replacement 
for a mother. A mother is really great. And you know, when a girl becomes a 
mother herself, then her worth of her mother 
increases further in her eyes. Is the food ready? Yes, madam, the food is ready. So why did you not serve it 
on the table yet? Madam, ten minutes are left. If I serve it right now, 
it will get cold. Hmmm. Is Arooj food ready? Yes, yes, her food is also ready. What did you cook?
Did you cook this? It will get cold, madam. Yes, so you do one thing, before you serve food, 
go clean the dining table. Go. I cleaned it before you asking me. No matter what you do, madam. I will not move from here. I don’t know what she will 
add to the food. Fine, tell me when food is served. Sure, sure. Wasai, did you prepare the food? Yes, yes, madam. I had prepared the juice and kept it
in the fridge to cool it. I will just give it to you. Hurry up. Thank you. Elder madam, are you taking this juice 
for younger madam? Why will I take juice for Arooj, 
am I her servant? I tried what I had to, once. 
That’s it. Sure. I had my doubts on both of them that hating younger madam, who can add the poison. Elder madam doesn’t care at all, so that leaves, madam. I can only doubt her. Where are you going so dressed up? There is a business dinner,
I am getting ready for that. Help me put on the coat. Business dinner? 
You didn’t even tell me. Yes, it slipped my mind. I just remembered so I told you. Hmmm. Then do one thing, 
keep me as your PA. I will remind you of all your appointments. You are the owner of my heart, how can I keep you as my PA? Arooj. What happened, Arooj? I felt dizzy. I don’t know why. You feel dizzy? Come, we will go to the hospital. 
I will get the dinner cancelled. No, I am fine. Nothing to worry about. 
I just felt dizzy. Arooj, what happened to you?
Look at you. You are not fine. Relax. I am absolutely fine. No need to cancel the dinner, just try to come a little sooner. Are you sure?
Sure. Take care of yourself. 
Yes. Okay, you sit. I am fine, you go.
 I am fine. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. I don’t know what has happened. You really have to take care of Arooj. In fact, you have to tell Salman how much you love Arooj, What will happen then?
What will happen then? Salman will praise you. And if Arooj misbehaves then you will see, he will drag her out of the home 
in one minute. If Arooj misbehaves with me, then my Salman will kill her. So, fine, you understand 
what I said, right? You just have to take care of Arooj. You have to love Arooj so much that Arooj too believes your love. Salman is your own, then you have nothing 
to worry about. Really sister in law? 
Is that so? Mehreen, what are you doing here? First you tell me 
what are you doing here? And look, please, 
don’t touch anything. I cannot find it. This… Oh God. What have you done? 
Take it, Wasai. Check things for once. Clean up. 
You never take care. This picture… Take it away, quickly. 
Go, quickly. You had called me. I called you two hours back and you are coming now. Madam, I was working, so I got a little late. I apologize. Really? Were you working or were you 
planning on killing someone? What do you mean? I didn’t understand madam. Why are you saying this? You ask yourself this. I don’t know. But I know everything, Wasai. What do you know? That nowadays you are being 
really loyal to Arooj. I am a servant, I am loyal to everyone. Really? So tell me, my loyal servant, how did this secret get out? What secret? That Arooj is Areej and 
she is Mehreen’s daughter. No, I didn’t do anything. I know nothing. You can make me swear. Oh wow, Wasai. You turned out to be a great actor. You are really cunning. You used to always be with Arooj, you used to show her love. Despite me asking you, 
you didn’t burn that picture, in fact you kept it safe with you, so that you show it to Arooj. 
Huh? You should be ashamed. You are really disloyal. Get lost from here, and yes, If I see you around Arooj, then I will teach you a lesson that you will never forget. 
Go from here. I understand.
