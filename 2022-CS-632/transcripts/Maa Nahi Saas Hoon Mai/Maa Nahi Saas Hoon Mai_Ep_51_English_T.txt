[23.44] The guesses you are making 
to find out what it is,
[28.88] maybe you won’t be able to know it.
[35.20] Because maybe I too just 
found out about this.
[43.20] Look,
[45.48] if there is anything 
you can share it with me.
[48.96] I can hear it.
[58.04] Okay come on, let’s go. 
Where?
[62.20] To meet your mother.
[96.64] Mama?
[106.84] Let’s go home Salman.
[118.48] Let’s just go to our home.
[141.72] I am really tired.
[145.40] Let’s go home.
[183.76] Let’s go.
[222.48] This girl has driven everyone mad.
[226.56] Neither is she present here at home,
nor is she at her parents’ home.
[230.84] But elder madam,
[233.20] how did you find out all this?
[235.68] I had called Salman,
[237.80] he too is searching for that girl.
[240.20] This is something worrisome.
[244.64] Arooj is the second name of worry,
[248.04] she has become a problem for us.
[251.44] Okay, okay, don’t worry,
[254.96] God will make it all fine.
[260.24] I will bring tea for you.
[279.84] You are here, finally.
[282.56] Where did you find her 
and bring her back?
[307.44] I am asking you something, Salman.
[320.08] Does my question have any value 
in your eyes or not?
[324.28] Mom, why are you saying that?
[327.24] Then what else do I say? Huh?
[329.52] This girl is missing from the home 
since morning.
[339.08] Arooj was with me.
[346.28] She was with you?
[352.40] But you had said that 
you are searching for her.
[365.16] Arooj’s phone got turned off,
[367.48] so I got worried I said it to you
 in my worry.
[402.88] You wait.
[422.12] Salman,
[424.32] do you know,
[426.64] this Arooj addressed your mother 
calling her mad.
[464.24] Yes, it is Sabrina’s birthday,
she wants to celebrate it in Dubai.
[469.16] So let’s plan, huh?
[474.96] Yes, come in.
[479.04] What happened?
[481.92] Come madam.
[484.76] Where do I come? 
What happened?
[486.84] To the lounge.
[488.60] A new case has been opened there.
[492.24] Against whom?
[494.04] Madam, you know
[498.96] there is just one criminal in this home.
[504.00] Younger madam.
[507.48] And Mehreen must have become 
the judge of that case.
[514.92] This woman has gone completely mad.
[517.28] Hey, madam, this is the case.
[522.20] She is saying that younger madam
 called her mad.
[530.68] and if this is true, Salman,
[536.96] then this means your mother 
is a mad woman.
[541.48] She is a mental patient.
[555.72] Do you think your mother is mad?
[559.92] This is the limit to misbehaviour.
[569.64] I have given birth to you,
[573.56] I have brought you up and made you 
a successful person and she says
[578.36] that your mother is a mad woman. 
She is a mental patient.
[590.48] Do I look mad to you, Salman?
[599.68] Arooj,
[602.04] what is this I hear?
[614.68] Arooj,
[618.00] answer me.
[626.08] Do you have an answer for 
what mom has said?
[636.08] What will she say?
[640.72] I had heard it with my own ears.
[643.40] She was telling her mother 
on the phone
[646.20] that aunt Mehreen is mad.
[660.96] Do I really seem mad to you?
[672.20] Arooj,
[675.24] do you think my mom is like that?
[682.40] Salman,
[685.48] what do you mean by look like this?
[687.68] You too are calling your mother 
mad with her.
[695.76] Arooj, why are you standing quietly?
 Answer me.
[700.76] I am sorry aunty.
[714.36] I am really sorry.
[718.64] Stop.
[730.92] Your sorry is you admitting that
[735.64] whatever mom has said is true.
[764.88] I apologize to you too, Salman.
[767.68] Aunty, please forgive me.
[769.80] Arooj.
[782.24] Go to your room child.
[810.60] You made her apologize?
[816.88] Huh?
[818.64] That too for something 
she has not said.
[824.96] Sister in law, Shaista
[826.52] I have heard it with my own ears.
[830.16] Those were my words.
[843.20] I had said that to her.
[852.12] I had told her that Mehreen is not 
that bad at heart,
[855.44] she is just a little mad.
[860.48] Mehreen you are so strict to children,
[863.76] I said this to her to console her.
[871.28] Now, she must have heard it and 
repeated it somewhere. That’s it.
[925.60] The only word you could think 
of was mad?
[946.96] Wasai,
[948.40] pick up the tea and take it away.
[951.28] Yes, elder madam.
[975.80] About aunt Mehreen,
[980.00] she believes that
[981.92] I should ignore what 
aunt Mehreen says,
[984.68] she is a mental patient.
[991.28] But mama, how can you live 
with a mental patient. She…
[1002.88] Aunty, I…
So I am a mental patient?
[1006.60] I am mad?
[1008.84] I get attacks?
[1011.96] No aunty, that…
[1014.20] Shut up!
[1018.44] Who were you telling that 
I am a mental patient?
[1021.56] I was talking to mama.
[1077.20] Arooj,
[1079.12] you are the limit child.
[1081.80] Was this something to say?
[1084.40] What?
[1085.56] That Mehreen is a mental patient.
[1089.56] Now Mehreen has another weapon
in her hands against you.
[1093.76] In fact you have handed it 
over yourself.
[1097.80] Child, do you have any idea
[1099.48] the difficulty with which 
I handled the situation?
[1103.52] and whatever she does with me,
[1105.80] can someone in their right mind
 do this?
[1109.88] I can understand child. 
You are right.
[1113.88] But you don’t say these things.
[1116.40] Be careful..
Lives pass in being careful.
[1121.24] Don’t do this, don’t do that. 
Don’t go here, don’t go there.
[1124.00] Be careful about everything.
[1125.44] To the extent that I have restrictions
on breathing in this home.
[1131.08] I know
[1133.00] how you are tolerating Mehreen 
in this home, child.
[1140.76] But child, I am worried
[1143.48] why you have this sorrow,
[1146.44] this sadness on your face.
[1149.72] What is the real issue?
[1152.84] Leave it, aunt.
[1158.08] There is no solution to this problem.
[1162.72] This has now become my fate.
[1197.76] Thank you God.
[1210.32] Hey, why did you make tea 
and bring it?
[1212.44] I would have made it myself.
[1214.32] You should rest.
[1217.76] You too need tea after food.
[1222.48] Keep it.
[1226.72] Did Arooj call?
[1230.32] Yes, I got a call but from Salman,
 not Arooj.
[1235.40] Really?
[1237.28] What was he saying? 
Where was she?
[1241.72] She was sitting at the sea side.
[1245.76] At the sea side?
[1249.32] What was she doing there?
[1251.88] She must want to see the sea.
[1254.96] That’s why she didn’t come 
to see her mother?
[1262.56] No master, 
there is surely something.
[1268.80] I know my Arooj.
[1272.36] Don’t you remember,
[1274.08] even if I would have a headache,
[1276.76] then she would stand next to me 
all night long.
[1281.96] Now I fainted, I came back 
from the hospital.
[1286.36] My child, Arooj, 
didn’t come to meet me.
[1290.16] You are thinking for no reason.
[1294.36] It is something to think
 about Master.
[1297.64] What is the thing that
 you think so much about it?
[1301.52] You get so worried?
[1303.16] Master,
[1304.92] don’t you find Arooj’s behaviour 
to be extra ordinary?
[1311.16] There must be some tension that 
she is not telling anyone.
[1314.84] Us?
[1316.64] We are anyone?
[1320.20] Can she not even tell her parents?
[1324.00] Okay, now you know she is fine.
[1327.36] Call in the morning, 
you will be satisfied.
[1335.16] I will call her,
[1338.08] but I will only be satisfied 
when I meet her.
[1346.32] Leave it, I will pick it up.
[1348.76] You rest.
[1350.96] Did you take your medication?
[1353.68] Yes, I did.
[1356.68] You rest after taking medication.
[1360.16] I will only find rest 
when I talk to Arooj.
[1393.64] Master,
[1396.68] if you drop something delicate 
and it breaks,
[1404.76] then you feel sorrow.
[1409.04] But there is no fear of being 
answerable.
[1413.12] Hey, who do we have to answer to
[1415.24] and why do we have to answer.
[1417.80] We don’t doubt the sincerity 
of our love.
[1421.40] We found Arooj,
[1423.16] we kept her close to our heart.
[1426.20] We didn’t have a daughter of our own.
[1428.88] We gave Arooj all the love.
[1431.96] We brought her up.
[1435.04] Now Arooj is our daughter.
[1467.96] Why are you surprised Arooj?
[1475.56] I came to praise you on your victory.
[1485.56] I am surprised.
[1487.24] I feel you are not able to sleep out 
of happiness of your victory.
[1493.12] What happiness of victory, aunty?
[1502.20] I am a lost girl.
[1505.40] You say these filmy dialogues
in front of Salman.
[1513.36] I am not going to be impressed 
with these tears of yours.
[1518.56] I am not shedding these tears for you,
[1522.44] I am shedding them for myself.
[1525.64] Another dialogue.
[1527.68] I know well about the innocence 
behind this face of your, Arooj.
[1535.88] Then teach me all this too.
[1542.96] How do you read the faces of people?
[1547.88] You should learn this from 
your mother, Arooj.
[1559.04] Similar to the way she has 
taught you all other things well.
[1593.52] How can you think so mercilessly, 
Mehreen?
[1598.04] Do you not feel mercy on Arooj.
[1602.68] If she speaks the truth, 
you think it is a lie.
[1605.40] If her mother is unwell, 
you think it is a drama.
[1608.72] How do I believe her?
[1610.88] She used her mother’s health as an excuse
and is sitting at her mother’s home.
[1615.04] So what do you think?
[1617.08] Even her mother is lying?
[1620.64] She is doing a drama of being unwell?
[1622.52] Yes, it is absolutely possible.
[1625.40] Oh my God. Mehreen, how much 
hatred do you have for Arooj in your heart?
[1631.16] You didn’t like Arooj from day one,
[1633.60] only because she is not yours, 
but Salman’s choice, right?
[1707.44] Arooj didn’t come.
[1709.12] Arooj found out about your ailment,
[1713.36] still she didn’t come to see you.
[1717.44] There must have been some issue 
with Mehreen.
[1723.88] That’s it,
[1725.72] she would be lying somewhere 
with her mobile switched off.
[1729.20] If there was some issue there, 
she should have come here.
[1736.40] If some issue happens 
with daughters,
[1738.92] they should come to 
their parent's home.
[1742.96] What can I say?
[1746.56] I don’t know what situation my daughter 
would be going through.
[1773.56] No master, there is surely something.
[1779.32] I know my Arooj.
[1782.96] Don’t you remember,
[1784.80] even if I would have a headache,
[1787.36] then she would stand next 
to me all night long.
[1792.48] Now I fainted, I came back 
from the hospital.
[1796.92] My child, Arooj, 
didn’t come to meet me.
[1800.56] You are thinking for no reason.
[1804.92] It is something to think about Master.
[1818.68] Arooj’s mother is unwell,
[1824.88] and she also knows that she fainted.
[1832.64] She got treated at the hospital.
[1838.60] Arooj would get up and come from 
her room on her mother coughing.
[1846.92] But after hearing such a big news 
she went to the sea,
[1849.48] instead of coming to see her mother.
[1857.00] This is something extraordinary.
[1866.44] I didn’t expect this.
[1873.28] But this action of Arooj is a reaction
to something extraordinary
[1884.12] or else Arooj cannot ignore 
this condition of her mother.
[1942.84] What is it that has made you quiet?
[1951.08] Arooj,
[1956.20] what is the matter?
[1959.76] If you trust me, then you can 
at least share it with me.
[1968.68] Why do I feel there is a secret that
[1972.12] you don’t want to share with me.
[1979.40] It is better that some secrets, 
remain secrets.
[1985.20] What do you mean?
[1987.40] If they are revealed then
[1989.60] it becomes a fun story for the world
[1997.60] and the one whose secret it is,
[1999.72] it becomes torture for them.
[2003.36] Arooj, what are you saying?
[2009.60] I feel I am talking to such an Arooj 
who I don’t know.
[2014.48] Even I don’t know anything,
[2021.20] but as much as I known,
[2024.92] I wish.
[2027.44] I was not able to even find out that.
[2035.28] What is the matter Arooj?
[2039.08] If you want,
[2040.84] I can drop you to your mother’s home.
[2043.72] You will feel better.
[2049.64] No.
[2051.84] Won’t you go to ask how she is?
[2056.84] What happened to her?
[2064.24] She must be fine.
[2067.88] Why are you talking in 
such a cold tone?
[2075.96] The ones who burn in their 
own sorrow,
[2080.28] they become of this cold tone.
[2086.92] If I am not wrong,
[2090.08] then are you having an issue 
with your mother?
[2097.48] With mama?
[2107.52] I have no issue with mama.
[2111.20] So, if there is no issue, 
then is there a misunderstanding?
[2115.20] Yes,
[2118.68] maybe.
[2124.20] If misunderstandings are removed,
[2129.04] then they hurt a lot.
[2133.04] You have started to say 
difficult things again.
[2135.72] Come on, get up, I will drop you 
at your mother’s home.
[2138.84] You don’t stay upset with 
your mother for long.
[2141.12] You look at me,
[2142.36] my mother talks to me so strictly,
[2144.48] I still don’t get upset. I get fine.
 Come on, come.
[2146.84] I don’t want to go anywhere. 
Please.
[2149.76] Leave me alone.
[2218.48] Salman.
[2221.60] It is good I found you here, 
I was coming to your room.
[2226.44] Go ahead, son.
[2234.68] Are you worried? 
Is everything fine?
