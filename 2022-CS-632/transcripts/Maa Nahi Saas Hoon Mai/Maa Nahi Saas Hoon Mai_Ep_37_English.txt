You are not that naïve either. You know well what I am asking you. What did you do that my son left home
and went to Islamabad. Aunty, I am just finding out from you 
that Salman is in Islamabad. Believe me, I don’t know anything 
about this matter, nor did I talk to Salman. Yes, when you upset my son, then 
why would he talk to you? Oh wow, Arooj, I used to consider myself to be smart, but you are much greater than me. You are getting upset with me 
for no reason. I honestly don’t know anything. Arooj, let me find out once, 
then you will see what I will do. I am your wife. Did you call me to tell me this? I have to say a lot, but you are not ready to listen. Arooj, what happened? 
Are you crying? Come here. 
Come and sit here. Sit here. What happened? I don’t understand aunt, why does aunt Mehreen always 
hold me responsible? Why am I questioned about everything 
in this home? No matter what happens in this home, 
why am I answerable for it? What did Mehreen say now? Aunt, if Salman is going to another city
without informing anyone, then what is my fault in this? Did you ask, Salman? He doesn’t want to talk to me. Look, Arooj, child, if Salman’s trust can be established if you fire Ammad from the job, then you fire him from them job. I cannot do that. What do you mean you cannot do it? His mother is a cancer patient, and he gets his mother’s treatment 
done with his salary. How can I leave him alone 
in this condition? You are right, child, but at times a person should become
selfish for the sake of love. It is a question of your own life. But, aunt…
No, buts. You help Ammad in some other way. You don’t know him, he will not take a single penny from me. He has a lot of self-respect. This fake mother of my son, Mehreen She is making the life of my son and 
daughter in law’s life hell. Greetings. Brother Ammad, your bill is for eleven 
thousand three hundred and sixty rupees. Eleven thousand three hundred 
and sixty rupees. One, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight, nine. I have nine thousand. Brother, do one thing, take out 
some medication from it. Because I only have nine thousand 
rupees. Brother Ammad, no issue. 
You can pay later. Money comes and goes. Later, but… I will only be able to pay 
after I get my salary. Fine, no issue. Thank you, man. Thank you. 
Your bill is for two thousand rupees. Excuse me, son. Yes? Is everything okay? 
Who is unwell? My mother is unwell. Oh, what happened to her? She has cancer. Oh may God give her health. Son, can I help you in some way? Yes. Prayer. Pray for her. Yes, sure, son. Okay, I will leave. I am getting late. Okay. Mehreen, you have blown things 
out of proportions. Brother Idrees, 
I did what you had told me. Then what is the point? Ammad is still on the job, 
she still hasn’t fired him. What do I do, brother Idrees? I could have asked Salman,
 so I did that. Now Arooj doesn’t want to fire that boy,
 then what can we do? This is worrisome and 
what is this Salman doing? His wife is not listening to him, 
that too on a business issue. I am surprised. 
Surprised. I think this is the sorrow my son has because of which he went to Islamabad
secretly, without informing anyone. What do you mean? 
Is Salman upset with Arooj? Obviously, brother Idrees, it is the doing of Arooj that always distance the son 
from the mother. Look Mehreen, there is just 
one solution for this entire issue, that Ammad is fired from the job. Think yourself, we used to have 
laughter in this home earlier, now we have friction and distances, 
and Ammad is the reason for it. Had Ammad not been there, 
nor would Salman have had a doubt, and neither would we have had 
an issue in this home. Think. You are right. Let Salman come, 
I will make him decide. And I know well that you are worried 
cause of these matters at home. Yes. Fine, I will go. This girl is embarrassing me 
in front of everyone. You people stop it. How long will you people conspire 
against your own home? How are you talking to me, Shaista? You have forced me to 
talk to you like this. What crime did I commit? Crime? You are just talking about a crime? You and Mehreen have made Arooj
 and Salman’s life hell. I am disappointed at you, Idrees. You even forgot that the one whose life 
you are ruining is your own son. How can I forget that Salman is my son 
and Arooj my daughter in law? That’s what you have forgotten. But I want to know why 
you have forgotten this? Answer me. You don’t have an answer, right? How will you have it? You have done something of the sort. What did I do? You made false stories about 
Arooj and Ammad’s affair. Shaista, what is wrong with you? Something has happened to you, Idrees. What has the child done to you? Why are you after Arooj? You know nothing, Shaista. You know, right? Then fix everything, because what you are doing right now 
doesn’t suit you. Arooj, you murdered my trust. You shattered my faith. That’s it, not anymore. You did what you had to, now it is my turn. You will have to decide. Ammad or me? This is the same boy that I had met at the medical store
yesterday. Okay, so this is Ammad, who has come between Arooj 
and Salman’s relation. But this child doesn’t seem the way Mehreen and Idress say he is. No, no, if I even say a word in Ammad’s favour, then Mehreen will feel I am opposing her. It is better for me to stay quiet on this. I won’t tell her that I have met Ammad. Look, Arooj, child, if Salman’s trust can be established if you fire Ammad from the job, then you fire him from them job. His mother is a cancer patient, and he gets his mother’s treatment 
done with his salary. How can I leave him alone 
in this condition? You are right, child, but at times a person should become 
selfish for the sake of love. It is a question of your own life. What is the matter? Boss looks like he is in a bad mood
early in the morning. If you have a bad mood early
in the morning, then you won’t get customers 
on your shop all day long. I am in no mood to joke. You are in a mood for coffee, right? Or will you ignore it like me? Thank you. I feel you are missing Mr. Salman 
because he went for four days. You know what do they say? Who do I dress up for? Who I do I make my hair for? Come on, man. Smile. Smile, Arooj. Ammad is asking you 
with so much love, so you should smile. Madam. Madam. Where did madam go? What happened? 
Why are you shouting? Madam, little master is back. Salman came back so soon? Idrees said he will come 
after four days. Madam, that’s what I came to tell you. Yes, so he wouldn’t have been 
able to focus, away from his own, 
away from his home, you tell me, what is your issue? No. No. Madam, I have no issue. You know little master got upset 
with little madam and went. And now that he missed his beloved wife,
he came running. Now I don’t know if he came running because 
he was missing her or not. But little master is standing 
in little madam’s office, and he is really angry, madam. And little madam and Mr. Ammad 
is also standing in front of him. Okay. Madam, you come with me. I am really worried. Little master is really angry. You come with me. Come on. 
Come on. Boss, you were going to come 
after a few days, right? Why? Should I not have come? Did I disturb you people? No, there is nothing like that. Because I always say your personality 
is really dashing. I feel really happy when I see you. Salman will you sit here, or will you go meet aunt first? You tell me, where should I be. And yes, no matter how dashing the boss is, you are never happy to meet him. No. You are happy to see some bosses. You are mistaken. Ammad, you please go from here. Wait. I want to talk to Ammad. Son, Salman, when did you come? And what is this? You came straight to the office 
as soon as you came. Come on, come get fresh. 
You go ahead, I will come. Hey, son. Come on. Come. Come on, first get fresh. You just came and you started working. Arooj. Ammad, please leave from here. Leave me alone. Okay. Come here. What were you doing? Huh? Salman, I am asking you. I am really angry at you. I know. So, I want to ask you that why did you turn against your wife
listening to Mehreen and Idrees? I didn’t listen to anyone.
You did. At least you are accepting that you have been misled about Arooj. I have no misunderstanding. I have noted everything myself. What did you note? Could you please explain? That’s what I was asking to Arooj, that if she can explain her relation 
with Ammad. But she didn’t say anything. She shouldn’t even have answered son. As good as a wife she is, she stayed quiet on this stupid question 
of yours, she tolerated it, it is great. Aunt, you don’t understand me. You are not understanding, son. Come on, go. Go to your room. I will send cool juice for you. Drink it and think with a calm mind, focus on your behaviour and 
Arooj’s character. Come on, go. Wasai. Yes, madam, coming. Make cool fresh orange juice for 
little sir and give it in his room. Sure, madam. Madam. Fine, you may go. Arooj. Arooj. Mr. Salman looked really angry today. He seemed like he was in a 
bad mood towards me. No, you have a misunderstanding. Yes, but why was he talking to me like this? That’s how he talks to everyone. Talk. That reminds me, that Mr. Salman was going to say 
something important to me, but madam Shaista interfered, 
so that was left incomplete. Thank God, it was left incomplete or else maybe you wouldn’t be here 
right now. What are you thinking? No, nothing. Will you do one thing? What? Now we will have to do everything 
really soon. Yes, fine, but why are you saying this? Because you cannot see what I can see. All the files we have opened, we need to gather the proofs 
on them really soon. Because we shouldn’t delay in declaring
the accused to criminal, or else all our game will be spoiled. What difficult things are you saying? Before we get into a difficulty, we will have to end this game. You know who I am talking about. Okay. Okay. Relax. Don’t worry, I will handle everything. In two days, the wind of two cities 
has tired you so much Salman. You didn’t even inform your mama that you were leaving and you didn’t 
inform her as you came back. What could I tell you? There was nothing left to tell. I have never seen my son 
so broken every again. You are really brave. Yes. Brave. But I don’t understand anything. I don’t understand that what is right and what is wrong. Only my Salman is correct. 
Believe me, Arooj too is wrong. You kept that Arooj close to your heart 
even though she wasn’t worthy of it. If you keep a lowlife close to your heart, then they will hurt you the same. Do you understand what I am saying? I will go to the office. Think yourself, we used to have 
laughter in this home earlier, now we have friction and distances, and Ammad is the reason for it. Had Ammad not been there, 
nor would Salman have had a doubt, and neither would we have had 
an issue in this home. Think. Salman, I want to talk to you. I don’t have time. 
It is something important. Because I will not tolerate that… I want to talk to you. I will talk to you later. What are these manners Arooj? Did no one teach you manners 
to enter someone’s room? I want to talk to you clearly. You? You will talk to me clearly? Yes, because I am used to 
talking clearly. Lower your voice and talk to me. When my reason is considered 
my weakness, then I need to raise my voice. Go from here Arooj, before I say something 
strict towards you. You, so do it. Why don’t you say it? I want to know what is in 
your heart after all. What you talk about behind 
closed doors is called a conspiracy but it is never the truth. Tell me what is in your heart? 
Say it to my face. No one has a need to conspire 
against you. You are your own worst enemy. What? What are you looking at? You are your own enemy. My son, Salman, someone so affluent 
added to his life and you... You showed him your true colours? True colours? Really? What colours have I shown, 
tell me as well. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything. Girls like you cannot be talked 
to about anything, in fact their mothers are cursed, 
who have given birth to a daughter like you. Don’t say a word about my mother. That’s why I am saying that 
I don’t want to say anything, because it is girls like you 
who give the people a chance to talk. Go from here, now. Leave. I don’t know what mothers give 
birth to such children. Ill-mannered girl. I don’t want to talk to you about anything. Girls like you cannot be talked 
to about anything, in fact their mothers are cursed, who have given birth to 
a daughter like you. Don’t say a word about my mother. That’s why I am saying that 
I don’t want to say anything, because it is girls like you 
who give the people a chance to talk. Go from here, now. Leave.
