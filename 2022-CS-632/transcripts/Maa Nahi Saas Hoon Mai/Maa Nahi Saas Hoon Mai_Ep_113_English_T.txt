[31.37] Don’t worry, sister Mehreen.
[44.47] No matter how long the days 
of difficulty are,
[47.90] it is always followed by 
an evening of comfort.
[55.30] Master,
[57.47] I too have full faith,
[70.03] good times will definitely come.
[89.63] Tea. 
Thank you very much.
[92.57] Give me mine.
[121.40] What is the matter?
[122.93] How did you people come inside?
[129.70] This is a home of decent people,
 inspector.
[132.43] At least you people should seek 
permission before coming.
[135.87] We know well how decent 
you people are.
[150.17] Come with us to the police station.
[151.80] But why? What have I done?
 What is my fault?
[154.20] You will find out your fault 
when you go to the police station.
[155.97] Look you…
[156.90] Where are you taking him? 
Leave him.
[158.40] Show me the warrant, first. 
Leave him. What are you doing?
[160.47] What are you doing?
[161.40] You are taking him for no reason. 
Why?
[164.67] Sister Mehreen.
[169.07] Sister Naseema, 
you first go call Arooj.
[171.50] But…
[172.23] You go and call Arooj. 
I will see. You go ahead.
[201.00] After me and Arooj,
[203.40] you have become the enemy 
of innocent people
[207.40] like sister Naseema and 
master Shoaib.
[208.47] I didn’t do anything,
[211.10] and even if I have done something,
[212.97] then I am not answerable 
to your useless questions.
[217.97] I don’t want to make you answerable
 for anything, either.
[224.23] Just tell me,
[232.40] don’t you miss your mother?
[236.43] Don’t you miss her?
[239.47] I don’t have an answer for
these useless things.
[245.73] And don’t you dare follow me again.
[253.23] Now, move from here.
[256.10] I said, move from here.
[262.40] I know what he would have 
said to you.
[266.07] I know well.
[272.53] And I also know that
[275.67] you have brought up Salman 
really well.
[283.67] You have brought him up like 
an exemplary mother.
[289.77] But he has lost his way, mama
[293.10] and there is no way to return.
[301.07] As painful this is for you,
[303.57] it is equally painful for me as well.
[311.40] But I feel that
[314.13] the sooner the two of us 
will accept this,
[318.63] the better it will be for us.
[400.70] Papa?
[433.37] Are you fine?
[436.93] I am fine, child.
[438.70] Don’t worry.
[443.70] I will talk to them.
[448.13] Madam, what are you doing here?
[451.47] Why did you bring him here?
[453.53] He is my father.
[455.20] Madam, this is the police station.
[456.83] You only bring the ones 
who are criminals here.
[459.63] Really? What has he done?
[462.33] What is his crime?
[464.23] You ask this from the inspector,
[471.40] and don’t stand here. 
We get humiliated for no reason.
[499.27] Papa, I will do something.
Don’t worry.
[503.10] Fine, child.
[508.10] Wait madam, 
where are you going?
[510.07] Get out of my way. Move, 
let me go inside.
[513.43] Sir, I told her not to, 
she came in forcefully.
[522.10] Go ahead, madam.
[524.30] Can I know why you have 
locked up the master?
[529.00] He has kept a child against her will.
[538.03] We have a request against him.
[542.13] Child?
[547.50] What child?
[549.13] What is the name of that child?
[552.07] Name…what is the name?
[554.43] Yes.
[555.97] The name of that child is, Areej.
[558.77] Areej?
[560.57] Areej is my daughter.
[571.13] And the one you have locked up
is my father.
[574.40] We will find out about this,
[576.87] when there will be an inquiry
[585.03] and our job is to do the inquiry, 
not yours.
[591.23] Can I know who gave an application 
against us?
[596.77] Go, madam. 
Go. Sit outside.
[605.20] Let me do my work. Go.
[607.73] Take her away.
[615.70] Take her and make her sit.
[617.63] Come on, madam. 
Leave my hand.
[626.47] Inspector,
[632.47] can I know why you have 
locked up my father?
[636.60] And finding out about this 
is my right.
[643.70] You arrested him from home
[646.37] and right now you are telling me 
that your inquiry is not complete.
[652.97] So, when your inquiry is not complete,
[655.07] then why is my father locked up in jail?
[663.97] And it is also my right to know 
who gave an application against us.
[668.70] Look madam,
[671.07] this is a police station,
[680.67] and I am the SHO here.
[683.47] Whatever happens here is 
by my will.
[695.30] Rest, as far as your right 
is concerned,
[697.73] you will get it. Right now go 
outside and sit.
[726.13] Why have you not left till now?
[732.20] Madam, why are you standing here
 and staring at me?
[734.83] Take her and make her sit.
[737.00] Come on, madam.
[742.20] Leave my hand.
[743.83] Madam, sit here calmly
[747.00] and don’t try to get up 
from here again.
[749.73] Maula Baksh 
Yes?
[751.10] Keep an eye on her. 
Yes, madam.
[752.87] She shouldn’t come in the office.
[906.13] If we have to get Areej,
[908.67] then we will have to take help 
from the police
[911.47] or else Salman will never 
give us Areej.
[917.83] He is really stubborn.
[920.30] No sister Mehreen,
[922.23] we shouldn’t go to the police.
[926.37] Why, master?
[929.83] Master,
[932.13] what is wrong in this?
[934.57] We all know Salman is a stubborn
and crazy sort of boy.
[945.10] He will get angry with 
our police report.
[952.50] But this way, 
we will get Areej, right?
[958.27] You are right, sister Mehreen.
[961.37] But he can do anything 
in case of his failure.
[965.20] Anything.
[979.13] Salman can fall so low?
[986.27] Do he not have any sense 
of his own?
[993.63] Listening to your parents,
[1003.37] you even forgot that
[1014.20] I am your love.
[1026.47] I am the honor of that home.
[1039.17] I am the mother of your daughter.
[1049.70] I wish, you would have come 
and seen
[1057.73] that I am sitting on the bench 
of the police station.
[1068.13] But God is seeing everything, 
Salman.
[1127.50] Salman, son, intelligence 
calls for this
[1131.63] that scaring is better than killing.
[1143.83] Yes,
[1145.10] I admit we made mistakes earlier,
[1147.77] but now we are on the right track.
[1159.87] And if master and Arooj are 
thinking of any proceedings,
[1163.90] then they will quit the idea. 
You will see.
[1168.93] They will quit.
[1170.70] How will they not?
[1173.33] They will have to.
[1182.03] It is good that they understand
[1191.83] or else I will get him imprisoned
 in such a case,
[1195.03] that master Shoaib will be 
in jail for life,
[1203.10] and Arooj will visit the courts for 
her father’s freedom.
[1236.87] The SHO is calling.
[1239.07] Attend it and put the phone 
on speaker.
[1252.07] Hello.
[1254.00] Yes, Mr. SHO.
[1255.73] Mr. Salman, your work is done.
[1258.50] Now tell me, 
what do we do next?
[1262.20] Talk to dad.
[1265.23] Yes, Mr. SHO.
[1267.50] Sir, we have locked 
the master in jail,
[1275.50] but his daughter has come
[1277.43] and she is asking a lot of questions.
[1286.97] Hey Mr. SHO, who can answer her 
questions better than you?
[1299.37] Yes, you are absolutely right.
[1314.83] Now tell me, what do we do next?
[1317.87] Mr. SHO, whatever you have 
done is enough.
[1334.70] Because right now we just want
to scare and threaten them.
[1354.60] And you know this well.
[1360.07] As you order.
[1372.73] Very good.
[1384.97] Now you will see,
[1389.93] the condition these two will be in.
[1419.43] You pushed my father? Huh?
[1421.70] You pushed him?
[1423.67] Push me.
Hit me.
[1426.17] Why don’t you hit me?
[1428.13] What do you think of yourself?
[1429.70] What is this arrogance for?
[1431.87] Respect.
Fame.
[1433.70] Why are you quiet?
Speak up.
[1435.63] Lower your voice.
[1438.40] This is my home,
[1439.97] you are not allowed to talk loudly here.
[1442.63] I will talk loudly.
[1445.53] And what is this home 
you are talking about?
[1449.30] Two minutes.
[1450.93] The ground from under your feet 
will be pulled in two minutes.
[1459.00] Areej.
[1461.03] Areej.
[1462.93] You cannot take Areej.
[1464.30] You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother.
[1466.40] I will stop you.
Leave me.
[1468.07] Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it.
[1469.53] Leave it…
[1483.67] Call that madam.
[1485.27] Yes, sir.
[1491.70] Madam.
[1495.93] Sir is calling you inside.
[1524.20] Sit.
[1543.00] Okay,
[1544.43] so you were talking about your right,
[1552.97] that who gave the application?
[1554.93] Why did we bring your father?
Why did we lock him in jail?
[1559.77] These are all your questions, right?
[1574.13] Look,
[1576.53] you are decent people.
[1580.13] I think that you let this matter go.
[1591.33] All this is not something you people
 can deal with
[1600.33] and you know this really well 
who did all this.
[1611.67] If you still want to hear it from me,
 then hear it.
[1622.83] This has been done by Mr. Idrees 
and his nephew,
[1625.80] in fact, he turned out to be his son.
[1628.80] Anyway, they did all this.
[1642.33] Look madam, they are really
 powerful people
[1652.13] and my advice to you is that
[1654.53] you don’t mess with them.
[1664.97] Look, whatever the matter is, end it
[1677.17] or they will ruin your life.
[1683.57] You know very well that 
we are innocent,
[1692.07] and instead of orchestrating 
actions against those people,
[1695.57] you are threatening me.
[1697.10] No, no, you didn’t hear me correctly.
[1700.03] You must have heard the idiom.
[1702.50] One who holds the stick, 
owns the buffalo.
[1710.80] These people are stick, 
and we are their buffalo.
[1723.17] Look,
[1724.83] take my advice and let it go.
[1735.13] You take her,
[1736.67] and leave her father from the lockup.
[1739.13] Okay sir.
[1740.47] Come madam.
[1750.47] Thank you very much.
[1757.17] But I want to say something to you.
[1766.77] The Mr. Idrees you are talking about,
[1770.13] he is my uncle,
[1776.37] and Salman is my husband
[1789.87] and I am the daughter of 
Waqar Ahmad.
[1803.57] The one, on whose instructions 
you are doing all this,
[1806.50] tell them,
[1809.17] sticks keep on changing,
[1823.13] God’s stick is silent.
[1835.33] The day that stick is wielded,
[1838.20] on that day, the entire city breaks
in a moment.
[1852.00] Inform them.
[1854.53] Thank you.
[1874.13] Fayaz,
[1875.60] let the master go. 
It is sir’s order.
[1891.67] Okay.
[1893.70] Maula Buksh. 
Yes.
[1895.23] Take the keys and let him go.
