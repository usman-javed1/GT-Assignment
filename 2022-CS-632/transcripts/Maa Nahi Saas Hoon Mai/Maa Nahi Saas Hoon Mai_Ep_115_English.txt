All right, Mr Shehzad,
I will do something, I’ll get back to you very soon. Thank you. I never thought anyone 
could stoop so low. Whatever is happening 
or has happened, it first made me weak but ever since all my ideas 
have turned out to be wrong, I don’t have any regrets at all, and I am not weak either. I have decided, I will face every situation, I will fight everything. Look, Arooj, I like your confidence but doing all this won’t be this easy. Hmm, I know it is difficult, in fact, maybe very difficult, but what is the worst 
that can happen? I will lose but I will fight the situation for sure. Anyway, I called you here at this time, Shanzey, I need your help. Sure, Arooj, tell me. Brother Nasir’s company 
is in danger, and all of this is happening
 because of me, if you can ask your uncle and 
get some tenders for this company, it would be a great help for me. Brother Nasir has decided, Shanzey, but the situation of the company 
that I see, I feel we will have to downsize, a lot of people will be unemployed just because of me. Okay, don’t worry, I will do something, 
don’t worry, yeah? Thank you. And why are you being 
so formal to me? Will you have tea or coffee? Coffee. Hello, send 2 coffees, thank you. I have found out through 
the management that Salman has ended all his tenders. Unfortunately, that’s how it is, sister in law. And all this is because of me, do you know brother Nasir, Salman owns 70% tenders 
of this company? And if these tenders are over, 
the company will finish. Why are you making this deal 
of a loss because of me? Sister in law, that seems like 
a loss to you, that’s actually not a loss. And trust me, 
I am very content that at least I didn’t take anyone’s
 lawful right and sister in law, tenders keep 
on coming and going, don’t worry at all. Yes, coming. Greetings. Greetings. Is this Arooj’s house? Yes but who are you? You won’t be able to get 
who I am. I want to meet Arooj. Arooj is not home, 
she has gone to the office. office? No problem, 
I will wait for her. Hey, Arooj is here. 
Greetings. Greetings, you? Umm, actually I wanted 
to talk about something. Come. Come in. Have a seat, please. Your Mom looked very nervous, she wasn’t even letting me in. Yes, now the situation of life has 
turned the way that we are scared of everything. You tell me, what brings you here? I… I am here to apologize to you. Apologize? Apologize for what? You were my well-wisher, but I was unable to judge you. I changed my address because 
Idrees asked me to, I cut out contact with you, I made a mistake in recognizing you though you wanted good for me. No problem, you did what you thought was 
right at that time, but that wasn’t just good for you but for all of us. I had no idea that Idrees would change so soon. His tomorrow never came for 
which I wasted all my life. But now even I am out of the way, and Uncle Idrees has successfully 
betrayed Aunt Shaista as well, why is he doing this to you now? Greed. Idrees has become greedy. He is very sure of the fact that he is the sole owner of the entire 
property now. He would just give me 
run-around earlier but now, he looks me straight in the eyes 
and says it but I have decided as well, I won’t let Idrees do 
what he wants so easily. Arooj, I want to apologize to you
 for the mistake I made, I want to help you now, you must stand in front of Idrees
 for your right and I will help you in every step 
that you need me. Thank you so much for your love, but now I don’t need any help 
from you because I want to fight 
this battle myself now. I wish, I wish you would have supported me
 at that time, then you wouldn’t be sitting here
in front of me as well and me and my family wouldn’t be
going through the hell we are going at the moment. I am actually very embarrassed. What had to happen, it did, now if you can do something, just pray for me. Sure, why not? I will go and check on Mom, 
she was making tea for you. Know, know, just allow me
to leave now, I shall leave. As you wish. 
Come. Thank you so much, Arooj, you heard me and 
gave me respect. Hey, don’t embarrass me 
by saying all this, I pray that you get 
your lawful right. Amen. You can come to my house 
whenever you need me. Thank you so much. Bye. 
Bye. So this is your Islamabad, Mr Idrees? You have been living here 
in this Karachi and I am destroyed 
in the same city. Idrees, who is this woman? I am asking you, who is she and what rubbish 
is she talking? Idrees doesn’t have any other lie 
to tell now. I will tell you, I am Idrees’ wife. Idrees, what is she saying? Answer me, she is talking 
about marriage. Hey, I don’t know 
who is this woman. Really? So you won’t even recognize 
your son and not even this ring. Hey enough now, you have been 
constantly talking, don’t you have any manners of 
what’s right and wrong? Shaista, I don’t know what is 
she saying. I don’t know. I will lie about such a huge thing?
Such a huge thing? Okay enough, one second, one second. Do you have any proof of this allegation 
that you are imposing? Come in. Madam? What happened? Madam, there is someone woman 
who has come to meet you. Some woman? Who is she? I don’t know I have seen her 
for the first time. Did she tell you nay name? Yes, her name is Musarrat. Okay, make her sit there, 
I am coming. That marriage certificate is false,
why are you worried? It's a false marriage certificate.
I am not worried, try to understand 
what I am saying. I am not amongst those wives who will see their husband 
with other woman and will start crying and whining, I have a grown-up son, he will take care of all 
these matters now. Umm Salman? Why are you dragging Salman
into all this, he has to look after a lot 
of business matters. Why are you panicking? You just said that woman is a liar. Yes, yes, she… So let’s see, Salman is coming back
from the office. Just pray that woman proves
to be a liar. When you went to work, a woman came right after it and said that 
she is his second wife. She was lying, lying. I don’t know if she was telling the truth or lie but she even had a 
marriage certificate. I am telling you it was fake. May I complete my sentence? My honor is at stake and you are about
finishing what you were saying, I have told you that I can never be terms 
with other woman when you are here and you listened to her? If she was honest, she would 
have been sitting. No matter if she was honest or a liar
but why did she come here? Only Arooj can tell that. Why did you stand? Sit down. I didn’t ask you to leave. You just don’t worry, I haven’t come here to go back. So that means you will get 
insulted and then go? Who will get humiliated here, you font have that authority. Don’t talk rubbish, come to the point that 
you are hear for. I don’t want to talk to you at all. You cannot do anything for me. What do you mean? You are being betrayed like me. both of us have been betrayed 
by the same man? It’s just that the problem is you 
don’t want to accept betrayal. You are the one betraying by lying you are Idree’s Wife, you are doing all this drama. That is the truth I have come 
here to tell.
