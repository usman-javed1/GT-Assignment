Arooj is absolutely fine and
you have become a grandmother. Yes. Wasai. Yes, elder madam. Tell the driver to get lots of sweets. My Salman has had a daughter. Yes. Yes. I will just bring it. Arooj has really good fate. You be quiet. You had scared me. I felt that my life is over. Your life got saved. In fact, it brought another life in this world. You are really brave. You tolerated a lot of pain, but you didn’t let anything 
happen to our child. Mothers can do anything 
for their children. I understood this pain today. What do we have in it? You know, I learned today that even the thought of living my life 
without you will kill me. I cannot live without you. Come in. How are you now, 
younger madam? I am in front of you, Wasai. I am fine. Send mom inside. She left. She left? She left? I had thought that I will hug mama, she will love me,
 she left. Arooj, aunt Naseema is outside. She is talking about mom.
Mom has gone home. Yes, yes, maybe younger madam 
didn’t hear me correctly. Should I go call aunty? I will bring her. Wasai, you stay. Thank God, younger madam, your life got saved. But what was the need for you 
to come to the stairs? I got worried in the darkness, Wasai. You know, I cut the foot with glass. I started bleeding, so I called out to everyone, 
but no one came. So I stepped down the stairs 
and started looking for you and I felt that someone pushed me. But no, maybe it is my imagination. Who will push me? But I didn’t tell this to Salman, because he would have created 
a scene in the entire home. I have a similar doubt. I have no proof, but I also know that you have enemies 
in this home. Who? Your second plan also flopped. No. it has not flopped. Arooj just has good luck, 
that’s all. This means, we have bad luck, 
and we should accept it. Accept defeat, when I give up. The game that is being played,
defeat is in front of us and we will not have any other 
option but to accept it. Don’t worry Idrees Ahmed, I have still not run out of arrows
 in my quiver. What are you going to do now?
Tell me. We only have two enemies 
in our home. One is Arooj, the other is Mehreen. Now we will do one thing, 
that we will tell Mehreen that Salman is not her son,
he is our son. What will that do? This shock will drive Mehreen mad. But our target is Arooj, who has 
the entire business in her name. It is necessary to defeat Arooj’s luck. We don’t have time. That’s why we will have to 
change the plan. No. No, think of something else. And keep in mind that we are 
competing against the wind. A little carelessness will throw us at a new place. Remember that. You will find more wives, but this child is your blood, your future generation. What are you saying aunt? Arooj is fighting between life 
and death there. She loves me so much, 
and you are telling me that I tell the doctor to save 
the child and let Arooj die. I think about the child who hasn’t 
come in this world, and the one with whom 
I have spent so much time, I leave her, I let her die. No, Salman… Salman is right sister in law, Shaista. If Arooj is important for Salman, then Arooj’s life is important for us. Don’t worry, nothing will happen to Arooj. Sign it. I didn’t make a decision 
is Arooj’s favour, I made a decision is Salman’s favour. I have no interest in Arooj, apart from this, that Salman loves her a lot. And the one who is important for 
Salman is also very important for me. Did you not get this thought 
really late? Till yesterday, 
you didn’t like Arooj at all and today, you like Salman’s choice. Till now, you too used to take her side a lot, 
sister in law, Shaista. Now what new flaw has come 
in front of you that you know and you are hiding it from me. No, no, Mehreen, I was saying this 
because of you… No, sister in law, Shaista not 
because of me. It is something else. Anyway, you don’t tell me, I will find out. Tell me, Wasai, 
I am worried. Younger madam, I don’t want to worry you, but it is necessary for the loyalty and faithfulness of this home, that I advice you to be careful. Are you pointing towards, aunt? It can be. Because when elder madam 
had brought that soup, that soup had fallen, and as soon as the cat had 
the remaining soup, it died at that very moment. How can aunt do this? Someone can hate another person, they can dislike someone, but how can someone take 
someone’s life? You are really naïve, 
younger madam. Those who are cruel can 
also take lives. So, my daughter. She… You rest. Your daughter is absolutely safe. You don’t worry. They have kept her in the 
baby care right now. I am badly stuck, Wasai. I don’t understand who do I go and tell all this to? I can understand. But if elder madam’s mental condition
 was not bad and her life was not in danger, then I would have told everyone 
the truth in one moment and made madam unsuccessful. But right now, we will have to 
keep this secret a secret. No Wasai. I will have to do something. Okay, I had made soup for Arooj. For me? Yes. Why? Can I not make soup for you? You can. You surely can. Mom, when we come 
from an outing, then Arooj will come back 
and have it. No, no, Salman, we will go 
after having soup. First I will drink the soup. Arooj, you were feeling restless,
you were not fine. The restlessness will be removed.
In fact, the restlessness has been 
removed. She made soup for me 
with so much love. I will have soup and… Your wife is really lucky. I think a prayer of yours 
came to help. Arooj is now out of danger, and congratulations to you, God has given you 
a beautiful daughter. Thank you so much doctor, 
can I meet Arooj? Yes, we are shifting her to the room,
then you can meet her. Thank you. Come on. Mom, did you hear 
what the doctor said? Arooj is absolutely fine, and you have become 
a grandmother. Yes. Wasai. Yes, elder madam. Tell the driver to get lots of sweets. My Salman had a daughter. Salman is your present, who you have under your control. But I have come here to find out, what family do you belong to? Do you even have a family or not? Whose daughter are you? Mama. Hey. Move back. Why are you stuck to me? 
Move back. Mama. What mama? Mama? 
Hey, move back. Why are you after me? 
Move, I tell you. Move. Have you gone mad? Why are you calling me, 
‘mama’, ‘mama’? I am not your mother. Yes, Salman, go ahead. Mom, you should have met Arooj, she would have liked it. I came to the hospital. Did you like it? That’s it. I just wanted that. And you didn’t even see 
your granddaughter. I saw her. She is my granddaughter. After all, someone should be 
at home to welcome her. And I will do that. Okay fine, goodbye. Goodbye. Son, Salman, what is the matter?
Is all okay? Yes, aunt.
Everything is fine. When is everything fine? Mehreen’s hatred for Arooj always gives me an opportunity. Stop it, Shaista. Let it go on like this for a few days. 
We will do something about Arooj later. I have told you, we don’t have time. Whatever, we have to do about Arooj,
we have to do it really soon. Come on. All of you are lazy. What is your duty? To keep a check on the generator,
 right? Yes, sir. So the generator is automatic. So when the light went, 
why didn’t it turn on? Sir, someone had switched off 
the breaker. I have switched it on. What do you mean someone 
had switched off the breaker? Who goes there apart from you? No one, right? You people 
take care of it, right? Madam, you here? Was there any work? Yes, I had some work. What are you doing here? Go out. Go out of here. Sure. Wasai. Ouch. Ouch. Yes, sir. What, sir, sir are you saying? What is this sir, sir? If God forbid something had happened
because of your carelessness. Had something happened 
to Arooj, then? Lazy idiots, they are lazy, 
they don’t work. Come on, go from here. They are weird people, 
they saw nothing. Did you see the situation became? I know, son. Sorry. Just relax. Come on. Come. Come. Come on. Wasai, I don’t want anything lacking 
in today’s function. Everything should be perfect. Don’t worry, madam. I have explained everyone 
their work really well. You did good. Wasai, did you see the child? Yes. She is really pretty. Hmm. She is really pretty. But Wasai, there was something special 
on her face. Special. What was special? She seemed just like 
your picture to me. The same eyes. The same nose. 
Everything. My picture? Yes. Now obviously, she is little master’s daughter, so she would be like you. Yes. Wasai, it is your duty, you have to take lots of care 
for the child along with Arooj. There should be no carelessness. I have to support younger madam, that’s what you said, right? Yes. I am saying it because 
she is Salman’s daughter and then Arooj too had an accident. Take care of her too. Don’t worry at all. I will do as you order me to do. If you don’t mind, can I say something? Yes, go ahead. Madam’s style… Yes, I understand 
what you are trying to say. I too am seeing that the behaviour 
of sister in law, Shaista is changed. Wasai, you keep both your eyes 
and ears open.
