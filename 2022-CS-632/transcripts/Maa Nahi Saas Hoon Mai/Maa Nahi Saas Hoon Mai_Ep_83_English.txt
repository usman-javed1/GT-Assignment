Look son, now that Shaista has 
uncovered the secret, listen carefully, I am not your uncle, I am your father and Shaista is your mother. This cannot happen, you guys will make me go mad! I think the facts you are trying 
to prove to be the truth are a lie and the facts which you are calling 
lies are the biggest truth of my life, she is my mother! Wait a minute. This is your birth certificate which the hospital gave us 
when you were born. All the documents after this 
are under Waqar’s name. Now do you believe me, Son? I am your mother, 
just hug me once… Don’t take a step forward! Look! Did you see? He still didn’t call me ‘Mother’. Shaista, pull yourself together, give him some time. Aunty! Aunty, what happened? 
Open your eyes. Are you alright? Get up, get up. Sit here, slowly. Wasai! Pull your feet up. Wasai! Are you okay? Wasai, come quickly. Yes, young Madam. Go and call Salman. Okay. No! There is no need to call anyone, I don’t need anyone. No one needs to call anyone. Go! All of you go.
 All of you go. You should go, and 
you should go as well. I told you to go. I don't need anyone right now, Go! Salman, what are you trying to find? I am trying to find myself, I have lost myself. You are not lost, you have just been found. Stop your nonsense! I don’t want to hear anything. 
Go away from here! Aunt Mehreen is not well, she is in her room. I will talk to you later. Salman!
Wait Shaista! Wait! Let him go, let him go. Leave my son, leave, come Salman. What? What are you saying, 
sister-in-law? I am telling the truth. Salman is my son, 
I gave birth to him. I gave Salman to you, just to save your life. Now I want my Salman back, right here, right now! How dare you utter such nonsense? You did not do the right thing,
 Mehreen! I will do this again and again, if you will do this then I will do 
this again and again. How dare you call Salman 
your son? Because Salman is my son! I’m really sorry. I don’t know what happens to me
and then everything gets ruined. This is my fault and I admit it. As of now, I want to stay with my parents. But why? I want to find my parents, I get lost in myself in that house, how will I be able to find 
someone else? I will help you find them, I am here with you. I was trying to be Urooj’s support, your parents will be found, but, in this mess of thoughts, I lost myself. In the festival of life, I lost the hand of my own family and I got separated. I am alone now. What was the reason behind 
whatever you said to Mom? Even though you know how 
possessive Mom is for me, she cannot tolerate such a thing 
even as a joke! And I don’t know why I am 
saying this to you because you are aware of 
Mom’s mental health, then, why did you try to prove this 
lie to be a truth in front of her? This is not a lie, Son. This is the truth. This is not a film or drama where 
I will agree with whatever you are saying. I will not believe what you are saying,
you are lying, this is not the truth. Did you see? What happened? You think that you did a good job by telling 
Salman everything? He had to know. If your conspiracy had 
not been revealed then you would have never 
thought about telling him. I did what I thought was right. He is my son, Salman is my son! Despite knowing the fact 
that you are his mother, he didn’t hug you even once! What happened? Are you shocked? This is exactly what I wanted 
you to understand. But your intentions are impure! No, my intentions are not impure. No, Salman is my son. Salman is my son! 
Salman is my son. He is my son! He is only my son. This is not a lie, son. This is the truth. You are not Mehreen’s 
but my son! Mehreen is not your mother, 
I am your mother. Enough! Don’t say anything after this. This is not a film or drama where 
I will agree with whatever you are saying. How shall I make you believe that you are my son
and I am your mother? No, tell him Idrees, 
tell him I am not lying. Look son, now that Shaista has 
uncovered the secret, listen carefully, I am not your uncle, I am your father, and Shaista is your mother. This is your birth certificate which the hospital gave us
 when you were born. All the documents after this 
are under Waqar’s name. Now, do you believe me, Son? I am your mother, just hug me once… Wasai, you are getting worried 
for no reason. Everything is going 
in the right direction. How is it going right? Everyone in the house has become
distant from one another. They have not become distant, they have just been exposed 
to one another and it’s a good thing, I got my mother and 
Salman got his mother. No, no young Madam, you don’t understand! What young master got, he is not accepting her 
as his mother, and when you will tell elder Madam, then she will not accept you 
as her daughter.
