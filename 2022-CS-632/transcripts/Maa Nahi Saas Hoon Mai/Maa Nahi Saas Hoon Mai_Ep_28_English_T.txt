[21.28] I asked you bring the 
files of Sasa builders,
[24.76] where is it?
[27.48] Look Mr. Nawaz,
[28.72] I won’t get my answer if
 you stand here quietly.
[33.20] After all what is your issue.
[35.52] Madam that file is on 
Mr Idrees’ table,
[39.12] he refused.
[42.12] Refused?
[44.24] What is there in that file 
that he refused?
[46.68] Didn’t you tell him that 
I want to see that file?
[50.64] I will tell him to give you 
the data immediately.
[54.44] Oh so now you are going to tell?
[59.60] I have been correctly 
noticing for past 2 days that
[62.32] you are very lazy in terms
 of working.
[64.88] but I am always habitual
 of working on time,
[68.16] the company never had
 any loss because of me.
[70.68] Yes, I have a very
 good idea about it.
[75.04] Sorry madam..
[76.44] Now go and bring all the files 
and data right now.
[82.72] Okay madam.
[92.52] What do you think?
[94.80] If I have started listening to 
whatever you say that means
[97.04] you should start misbehaving 
with mom and I will stay quiet?
[100.28] Sorry, that won’t happen.
[103.12] You are getting it wrong, 
I did not say anything like that.
[106.36] Look Arooj,
[108.20] I have taken you out of home and 
brought you to the office,
[110.88] now what do you want?
[112.28] Should I drop you off at 
your parent’s house?
[118.04] What do you mean?
[119.16] Look, it’s very clear,
[121.96] you cannot live with mom
[124.16] but I am incomplete without her,
[126.84] now you tell me what should I do?
[140.68] We will call a meeting for a it,
[142.12] there is nothing like that.
[144.20] Yes, yes. Okay, 
I will talk to you later.
[149.44] Yes Nawaz? What is it?
[151.16] Boss, get ready,
[152.76] bad times are about to come.
[156.28] What rubbish?
[157.76] Tell me what happened.
[160.36] Sasa builders files are 
being opened.
[165.88] Who is opening this file?
[167.56] New director of Finance,
[169.24] madam Arooj, who else?
[174.40] What will she get out of that file?
[176.28] What we have,
[177.88] I mean you have hidden.
[187.28] Boss that cannot be 
hidden for very long.
[191.32] Did you open your mouth?
[197.64] I guess I have to do
 something myself.
[200.48] Boss my job seems to
 be in danger itself.
[202.92] Madam Arooj doesn’t like me
[205.48] because I work for you.
[210.72] Boss, do something, I will die.
[214.84] Okay, okay, don’t worry, 
I will do something.
[217.64] You just keep your mouth shut.
[221.96] Okay boss, don’t worry about that.
[225.08] Go.
[341.08] Waqar never got to know about me,
[347.08] Salman trusts me blindly as well so,
[350.32] where did this Arooj 
come from?
[354.88] And why is she getting
 into accounts?
[367.20] Sasa Builders means that
[369.48] the corruption I did of 3 million
 will be caught.
[376.96] No, I won’t let that happen,
[382.44] my honor will be compromised 
in front of the whole family.
[389.72] I will have to stop Arooj.
[400.92] Salman.
[417.72] I don’t know Shanzey
[419.76] I couldn’t understand 
Aunt Mehreen yet.
[423.68] Arooj, like it has been 20 
years to your wedding
[427.08] and these mothers-in-law,
[428.84] you can never understand them
[433.84] umm that’s what my mom says
[436.68] about my grandma.
[438.32] Shanzey, I am serious, okay?
[440.60] Your home feels less like home
[442.52] and more like an ICU to me,
[447.60] where a daughter-in-law is
 always in a bad condition.
[453.04] I don’t understand, dude,
[455.52] Aunt is not happy if I stay home,
[457.84] or if I go to the office,
[459.96] she always has a problem with me.
[462.92] She has made my life so 
confusing in a few months only.
[467.04] When, what, how, what happens,
[469.88] I can never figure out.
[474.24] I am unable to figure out how 
she will react on what.
[485.64] What happened? 
Am I boring you?
[490.52] No, I would have revealed your secret 
if I had gotten something to eat.
[500.24] Yes, food must be here anytime,
[502.52] just eat well and suggest 
me what should I do.
[508.16] Arooj, that girl, I mean,
[511.56] I am sorry, your mother-in-law,
[514.88] she is very possessive,
[517.20] she doesn’t want anyone to 
come close to brother Salman
[521.72] and even unwillingly,
[524.12] you may call it your
 bad luck or your luck,
[527.48] you are brother Salman’s wife,
[529.44] and you are the closest to him.
[582.64] Uncle, you here, all of a sudden?
[584.48] Is everything okay?
[586.36] Please have a seat.
[596.76] Look, son,
[597.92] it is not the tradition
 of our family that
[599.56] women should interfere
 in business matters.
[603.36] Who has interfered that you 
are getting so serious?
[610.32] Are you talking about Arooj?
[613.80] Exactly,
[615.32] Mehreen and your aunt never even 
asked about the office matters.
[619.04] Yes, because they 
were never interested.
[622.20] And Arooj,
[624.04] Arooj is very talented,
[626.36] she can take care of
 the entire business,
[628.80] that is why she is taking interest.
[635.72] You tell me, what do you want?
[638.84] Look, son,
[640.48] the typical mother-in-law, 
daughter-in-law
[642.56] tension between 
Mehreen and Arooj
[644.44] is not hidden from anyone.
[646.48] If she will stay with Mehreen,
[648.48] she will adjust
[650.32] else the gap will never be fulfilled
[656.52] and you will be divided
 between both of them for life,
[663.16] because neither you leave Arooj,
[665.24] nor Mehreen, so that is why
[668.92] you should try to make 
Arooj understand
[670.44] it is not right to stay 
away from home.
[675.72] okay fine,
[677.72] I will talk to her.
[682.76] I will talk to her as soon
 as she comes.
[739.32] Why are you so quiet?
[740.76] Hmm,
[744.60] nothing.
[747.28] There is something.
[750.44] Arooj, I was thinking that
[753.92] instead of giving time to
 the office it will be better
[757.56] if you give time to mom.
[763.04] You are saying the same thing again?
[766.04] I think we have already discussed it
[768.36] and we wouldn’t do it anymore.
[770.64] And I am doing all this 
because you asked me to.
[777.96] I am not saying much to you,
[780.28] I am just giving you a suggestion
[783.16] that if you stay at home,
[785.36] it will be easier for me.
[788.32] And what about the
 difficulty for me?
[792.00] Arooj, look I…
[793.12] Look, Salman,
[794.80] for now I am very happy 
at the office
[797.40] and when I would want 
to leave the office,
[798.76] I will inform you that
[799.96] I won’t be coming to 
work from now on.
[802.68] I don’t know why are you talking
 about this to me today.
[809.16] I have just adjusted 
in the office,
[811.96] and I feel that now I have
 started to work there,
[817.16] and please Salman,
[819.44] don’t tell to my parents,
[822.84] they are very happy that
 I am going to the office.
[826.96] Don’t worry,
[829.48] I won’t come in, I am just 
going to drop you.
[832.80] Why? Won’t you meet them?
[835.84] No, give time to your parents.
[866.92] Why didn’t Salman come?
[869.12] When he came to drop you off,
[870.88] he could have come inside.
[872.44] You know that
[874.04] his business dinners 
are always on,
[876.28] he will come in when he
 comes to pick me up.
[878.64] He should,
[880.16] he is our only son-in-law,
[882.40] he loves our daughter so much
[884.60] so he should give us a 
chance to thank him.
[886.92] Now let Arooj eat,
[889.72] or will you keep on talking?
[891.64] Naseema Begum,
[894.04] she is hearing her dad with her ears
[897.76] and the food is eaten by mouth.
[900.12] Enough, enough,
[901.20] keep your philosophy to you.
[905.36] By the way, dad,
[906.96] mom’s scolding session is still on?
[911.04] See.
[914.24] By the way, my child
[915.80] you should have gone
 with Salman too.
[918.52] You are a part of the company too.
[922.64] You are a part of me first,
[924.48] dinners always keep on 
happening, dad,
[926.52] I will go some other time.
[930.00] Your mother has a lot of reservations 
about you going to the office.
[935.68] What sort of reservations, mom?
[939.64] Is everything okay at home?
[946.96] It is not okay,
[955.08] Aunt Mehreen tries causing me trouble 
through different ways all day.
[962.36] At least, I will stay away from her taunts
 and talks if I go to the office.
[973.52] What does Salman have to 
say about your decision?
[978.36] This is Salman’s decision only.
[982.36] So that is good
[985.24] and then a mother-in-law
 like Mehreen,
[987.52] a mother-in-law that
[989.00] doesn’t have a daughter 
of her own,
[991.48] expecting her to care is 
useless, my child.
[996.76] But Arooj, I don’t expect any
 sort of mistake from you.
[1001.88] You are an obedient daughter,
[1003.56] stay the same,
[1006.88] you and Salman has to 
be on the same page.
[1014.00] Naseema Begum, 
I am also an obedient husband.
[1022.64] Mom, have food.
[1024.04] Yes, I will take it.
 You take Salad.
[1026.84] Yes, please take it,
[1028.80] she has made it with 
so much difficulty,
[1031.88] I got scolded a lot.
[1061.12] you didn’t sleep yet?
[1064.52] Have I ever slept before you came?
[1070.68] Where is Arooj?
[1072.96] Arooj,
[1074.24] I dropped her to Aunt 
Naeema’s house.
[1078.60] Wow, amazing Salman,
[1083.20] you married Arooj
[1085.16] so she doesn't give 
you any time at all?
[1088.20] What are you saying, mom?
[1090.36] Every girl goes to her 
parents' house to stay
[1093.40] what is the big deal?
[1095.60] Salman, I don’t like men 
who take their wives’ side
[1099.48] and especially,
[1102.04] in front of their mothers.
[1108.48] By the way, if you don’t mind,
[1110.04] the way you are defending Arooj,
[1112.24] shall I give you a suggestion?
[1115.40] What suggestion?
[1118.00] If you want to listen to me, then
[1119.12] drop Arooj to her parents’ 
house forever.
[1128.20] I mean you want me to let my wife
[1131.36] be at her parents’ house forever?
[1134.04] You are joking, right?
[1135.60] Your life has become a joke,
Salman.
[1142.24] You saw that girl somewhere
 then you married her,
[1146.08] you brought her home
[1147.84] then took her to your office.
[1154.52] I will bring Arooj in a while.
[1157.24] Okay, Salman,
[1163.32] consider what I said.
[1192.72] Wasai, lay the food.
[1195.64] Okay.
[1237.60] Arooj, my child,
[1238.36] a child is a mediator 
of her parents’ house.
[1243.88] Wherever they go,
[1245.24] they represent their family
[1249.48] I know dad.
[1251.12] You would even know that
[1252.68] one person personality
[1255.28] can give an opinion about
 the whole family to people.
[1260.72] You have already said it 
to me so many times
[1263.80] then why again today?
[1265.88] Just like that.
[1271.84] Okay, my child, listen to an advice.
[1275.40] Say it.
[1276.72] Always live with your
 head up in life.
[1283.92] And that is only possible
[1286.28] when your own
 personality is strong.
[1292.32] Now that you have gone 
to the office,
[1294.28] work with honesty
[1296.88] that it progresses,
[1298.64] prominent progress.
[1303.16] I look after finance dad,
[1305.40] honesty and integrity is the 
basic condition for me.
[1309.28] Absolutely,
[1310.56] that is what I am trying to say.
[1316.20] Look you are at the highest 
post of your department,
[1320.60] that’s a huge responsibility,
[1324.64] where money is involved,
[1327.24] it doesn’t take long for people 
to become dishonest.
[1335.04] Obviously, there must be a lot 
of people working under you,
[1340.20] never blindly trust anyone,
[1347.64] check and balance is very 
important in money matters
[1351.68] you are absolutely right,
[1354.08] I am always in favor of strictness 
when it comes to rules and work
[1359.24] and I have always
 learned that from you.
[1363.28] Good job, my child, good job.
[1365.84] I am sure about your success.
[1369.24] Arooj,
[1370.52] if you are done with 
your dad’s advices
[1375.16] give some time to your mother too.
[1379.00] Wow, that’s amazing,
[1380.56] a mother does all the wait 
and preparations
[1383.80] and when daughter comes,
[1385.20] the family claims all the rights.
[1386.80] Hey, now I have come to my mom.
[1389.36] I understand everything,
[1391.08] I understand everything,
 Naseema Begum.
[1393.08] You are making my daughter 
against me that too in front of me.
[1398.56] If you don’t mind, can I take 
some of her time too?
[1403.00] Take it, take it.
[1405.12] Come.
[1419.48] Brother Idrees,
[1420.68] complete what you were saying,
[1422.24] why are you hesitating.
[1423.88] Mehreen it is because 
of the kind of matter,
[1426.80] it is not easy for me to talk about it.
[1433.20] Arooj is a newbie kid in front of me,
[1436.20] I have as much experience as
her age in the business.
[1439.68] After all, what is the issue?
[1443.36] I have been working for this 
company for years,
[1445.44] I have given a lot of services to
 make your son a successful businessman
[1450.68] but I think that gradually Arooj has 
started to impose herself in the business,
[1455.96] like she is trying to control everything.
[1460.12] Like she took my Salman in her control
[1464.60] now she is trying to take over his business?
[1469.36] I can see everything and
[1470.84] I can even understand your pain.
[1474.68] Anyway, leave that,
[1479.20] Arooj is so sharp,
[1482.32] she doesn’t look like that at all.
[1484.40] You must talk to Salman.
[1486.64] Salman makes decisions of the business
[1488.76] and you make the decisions here.
[1491.88] Now Salman doesn’t listen to me,
[1493.64] he just listens to Arooj.
[1495.56] Mehreen at least you listen to me,
[1497.80] stop Arooj from going to 
the office immediately
[1503.36] else she will destroy 
everyone’s life, yeah.
[1562.12] Idrees, why do you 
want to stop Arooj?
[1567.08] Hey why don’t you understand
[1569.56] that whatever we handed over to
 Salman after a lot of thinking,
[1572.16] there is a shareholder in it now.
[1573.72] Arooj wants to control
 the whole office.
[1576.28] There is nothing like 
you are thinking.
[1579.04] Whatever Arooj is doing
 is for Salman only.
[1583.24] And what if I say that
[1585.24] she is treating me like 
an employee, then?
[1589.44] No, no Arooj is cannot do that.
[1592.16] So, am I lying?
[1594.32] No, I am not saying that.
[1596.96] You said as if I am lying.
[1602.12] When I am saying she is not treating 
me right so I am being honest.
[1608.40] Idrees, you can also
 have a misunderstanding,
[1613.08] Arooj cannot be ill-mannered.
[1615.64] Okay you will believe when Arooj
 kicks me out of the business.
[1620.40] There is nothing like that,
[1621.64] I don’t know what do 
you keep on thinking.
[1623.36] You have had a misunderstanding 
for no reason, that’s it.
[1677.92] I have been working for this 
company for years,
[1680.12] I have given a lot of services to 
make your son a successful businessman
[1684.04] but I think that gradually
[1686.88] Arooj has started to impose
 herself in the business,
[1689.60] like she is trying to 
control everything.
[1691.36] Arooj is so sharp,
[1694.48] she doesn’t look like that at all.
[1696.68] You must talk to Salman.
[1698.88] Salman makes decisions 
of the business and
[1700.88] you make the 
decisions here.
[1704.04] Now Salman doesn’t 
listen to me,
[1705.96] he just listens to Arooj.
[1707.76] Mehreen at least you
 listen to me,
[1710.04] stop Arooj from going 
to the office immediately
[1712.48] else she will destroy
 everyone’s life
[1723.76] Wasai,
[1725.28] is your Madam Arooj home?
[1727.44] Yes, Madam Jr is coming.
[1735.76] yes aunt, did you call me?
[1738.08] Yes, I did,
[1739.88] that is why you have come here.
[1743.80] And by the way,
[1744.88] I can’t find out where 
are you nowadays.
[1755.08] Madam, may I go?
[1758.28] Stand here.,
[1763.60] Arooj do you know
[1765.92] what is brother Idrees and 
Salman’s relationship?
[1768.12] Yes, I know.
[1770.28] Brother Idrees is the 
elder in this house.
[1774.12] I know all this aunt.
[1776.76] It’s good that you know
[1779.00] and it is also important for you to know.
[1783.92] What have I done?
[1786.28] I don’t know that
[1788.36] but you won’t go to the 
office from tomorrow.
[1801.16] Why are you looking at me like this?
[1807.36] Have I said something impossible?
[1829.36] Go, you may go now.
[1832.60] Okay, madam.
[1870.28] Aunt Mehreen
[1874.12] started the conversation with the
relationship between uncle
[1879.20] and Salman’s relationship and him
 being the elder of the family,
[1885.24] why
[1889.20] after all, why does uncle have so much
 issue with me working at the office?
[1902.60] He wasn’t like this until yesterday.
[1910.72] Is there any secret 
that is being hidden?
[1922.52] And it can be revealed 
because of me.
[1928.96] What can it be?
[1935.24] I am just looking 
after the accounts.
[1941.80] It means if there is any secret,
[1949.52] so it is in the accounts.
[1984.68] Arooj?
[1991.44] Is everything okay?
[1996.56] What are you thinking so seriously?
[2002.44] Tell me something, Salman.
[2011.24] You asked me to go to the office
[2019.24] and then refused later on.
[2029.92] I just want to know
 did you do all this
[2033.72] because uncle asked you to?
[2038.68] Yes,
[2045.28] but why do you ask?
[2057.56] Nothing.
[2073.08] Don’t stop me from going 
to the office next time.
[2077.68] okay,
[2082.16] as you wish,
[2084.80] you can go to the office.
[2136.00] Boss I was telling you to do 
something about Madam Arooj.
[2141.72] Has Arooj come to the office?
[2143.00] Yes.
[2147.88] And she is very active too.
[2152.04] It means Mehreen 
couldn’t even stop her
[2154.00] and she is doing all this 
by Salman’s support.
[2159.48] I don’t understand, boss.
[2160.84] Hmm
[2162.60] No nothing,
[2163.96] tell me what did she do now?
[2167.16] No, she didn’t do anything
[2169.16] but it looks like she is 
about to do something.
[2171.08] A big explosion.
[2178.52] She has asked for all the
 files of Sasa Builders.
[2184.36] And boss, she is so intelligent,
