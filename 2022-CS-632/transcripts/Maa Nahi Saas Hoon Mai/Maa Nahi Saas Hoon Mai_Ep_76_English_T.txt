[20.88] Grandma’s love.
[23.12] Grandma took you in her arms 
and you slept immediately.
[25.92] Once grandma sets you down 
you will start crying immediately.
[28.40] Little bundle of joy.
[43.24] This is not right.
[45.24] Grandma wants to play 
and you sleep.
[47.88] I will put you on the bed and 
you will wake up again. Right?
[50.56] Oh my beloved baby.
[62.12] Papa’s princess.
[64.12] Papa’s doll.
[65.68] My Areej.
[81.32] My Salman’s fairy.
[84.16] Beloved. All our beloved.
[87.04] Our life.
[89.44] Areej,
[90.68] grandma is tired,
[92.24] should I make you lie down 
on the bed?
[99.80] For a little while. 
Okay.
[101.40] Hey, hey, that’s it. 
That’s it.
[103.20] Come on. Come on. 
Come on.
[106.04] Come on. 
Come on.
[108.64] Love.
[118.04] Papa’s princess, little fairy.
[159.64] Wasai.
[161.60] Wasai, come and take Areej.
[227.04] You didn’t have the soup.
[234.44] It must have gotten cold by now.
[243.12] I will ask Wasai, to make it again.
[248.60] I don’t want to have soup.
[304.24] I have brought soup for you.
[306.44] I don’t want to have anything 
with your hands.
[310.56] Fine,
[313.24] you have it with your own hands,
[315.76] I just made it.
[317.44] I told you, 
I don’t want to drink it.
[321.84] You will have to drink it
[323.52] and that too for ten days
[325.16] because this is your diet plan.
[328.72] You are just saying 
what you want,
[330.64] you don’t care about 
what I am saying.
[332.80] I care.
[334.00] I care about your health.
[337.92] Why do you care?
[340.04] Let me die.
[341.84] Please aunty, 
don’t say these things.
[349.52] You have to live for Salman’s sake,
 Areej’s sake.
[467.92] Elder madam called me 
with so much anger.
[477.52] But you are coming back smiling.
[485.12] Yes,
[486.76] because she is angry with me.
[493.44] But she has become friends 
with Areej.
[499.32] That had to happen.
[504.84] Okay Wasai,
[506.28] her soup is cold, 
she didn’t drink it,
[509.32] make it again.
[510.88] Sure.
[568.00] Greetings.
[569.36] Yes, Arooj child,
[571.20] how are you? Greetings.
[574.84] I am just fine.
[583.32] I cannot tolerate staying away
 from mama, anymore.
[587.60] I cannot tolerate it. 
What do I do?
[590.84] She is feeling you, Arooj,
[598.68] but right now Mehreen is not 
in the condition
[601.88] that we can give her 
any further shock.
[606.92] You keep yourself in my place
 and think.
[610.40] If you were there, then what would 
you have done? Tell me.
[613.68] You will have to do all this really 
slowly and gradually, child.
[619.32] I don’t have time, mama.
[621.80] I don’t have time.
[628.88] I have to tell Salman, what whose 
relation is with whom.
[634.08] This can make things worse, Arooj.
[637.12] How much worse can it be than
it is right now, mama?
[645.84] I have to save mama and
Salman from their competitors
[649.96] and the greedy people of this home.
[653.56] Competitors?
[658.44] Who are their competitors, child?
[669.52] Uncle and aunt.
[671.32] Uncle and aunt?
[680.20] Okay, Arooj, child, listen.
[687.60] Now you need to be really careful.
[690.48] That’s why I am saying, 
be careful.
[693.20] What if you make a wrong decision?
[695.68] Look mama,
[697.88] now I cannot tolerate staying away
 from my mother.
[705.52] And secondly,
[708.08] I don’t want to give the people 
of this home this much time.
[713.00] Fine, child.
[715.08] Do as you think is right.
[719.56] Bye.
[720.96] Bye, child.
[722.52] Take care of yourself.
[749.72] Wasai,
[752.76] Arooj has always praised you.
[757.36] In her toughest days,
[762.56] you have been her well-wisher.
[767.40] Younger madam is really good
 herself.
[774.84] With this health,
[777.68] why did Arooj come down 
the stairs?
[782.00] Why did she climb down?
[784.20] Were you not there at that time?
[791.80] What do I tell you now?
[822.44] Younger madam,
[824.88] I have told you the entire incident.
[828.80] You still don’t understand?
[833.00] Wasai, I don’t understand
[836.80] the reason for this behaviour of her.
[846.36] Earlier, an attempt was made 
on my life,
[851.00] then they tried to play with 
the life of my daughter.
[859.56] Why is she doing all this?
[865.20] These games of money
is really bad.
[874.00] It makes you do everything.
[893.12] Meaning,
[895.48] that this home, wealth,
[898.76] this entire business,
[901.08] all this belonged to elder sir,
[907.00] and on your birth,
[909.60] elder sir put everything 
in your name.
[924.48] What...
[927.36] What are you saying, Wasai?
[929.20] I am right, younger madam.
[937.20] All this belongs to you.
[939.64] You are the owner of it.
[945.76] Mama says that
[953.00] if I am not careful, 
I will make a mistake.
[960.80] But as much have things 
have deteriorated,
[968.40] how worse can it get?
[975.28] If I can get my mother,
[983.12] then what loss do I have 
to worry about?
[990.20] I hugged my mother,
[994.28] but right now, the mother has 
to hug her daughter.
[1002.00] She has to hug me.
[1007.88] She has to hug her Arooj.
[1034.04] Idrees,
[1036.08] why do you look so worried.
[1039.76] What happened? 
You had gone to the lawyer.
[1043.40] What did he tell you? 
What did he say?
[1046.36] Everything is ruined.
Everything is upside down.
[1049.60] What do you mean? 
What happened?
[1051.68] Waqar put his entire property and
business in Areej’s name.
[1056.68] Yes, all of us know that.
[1058.96] Waqar died, Areej got lost.
[1061.28] So, I got the legal right, so I gave 
Salman all the rights.
[1066.08] Idrees, we know all this.
[1068.72] What has happened now? 
Tell me.
[1070.64] Now the real owner of the business
 and property is here.
[1074.08] She will take her right from us.
[1075.72] How will she take it like that?
[1077.08] If we don’t give it, she will take it
legally. She has a strong case.
[1079.92] She is Waqar’s daughter.
[1089.60] What is this problem? 
What will we do now?
[1093.16] Now you won’t do anything.
[1095.60] I will do whatever needs to be done.
[1098.68] Me.
[1113.76] What happened aunt?
[1116.08] I asked Wasai to make 
a cup of tea for you,
[1123.72] so she said no to my face, 
she said I am taking care of Areej.
[1131.00] I had told Wasai to stay with Areej.
[1134.04] Why do you have surveillance 
at home?
[1136.52] Couldn’t she leave her 
for two minutes?
[1138.36] She couldn’t leave her at all.
[1140.88] Why?
[1146.08] At times, we become more insecure 
inside the home, than outside.
[1158.92] So, you have to keep an eye.
[1246.68] What is the matter?
[1258.56] Has a new life come 
to this home or
[1262.12] did someone die here?
[1280.16] I see sorrow on everyone’s face.
[1285.00] Mehreen, I am really happy.
[1291.76] In fact, we are all very happy.
[1306.44] It is just Arooj who is staying 
away from everyone.
[1340.60] I will not ask Arooj anything,
[1347.72] because the pain she went through,
[1350.36] after that a person suffers 
from depression.
[1373.76] And then Arooj has given 
my son a big gift.
[1382.76] My son is really happy.
[1421.96] So what do we do?
[1429.56] You tell me.
[1431.72] How do we celebrate happiness?
[1435.80] It is more important for happiness to 
show on the face, than celebrating it.
[1454.16] If we cannot come in front of us 
with a smile on our face,
[1458.16] then what is the point of sitting 
across each other and having food.
[1471.12] You are right.
[1473.56] Wasai, give me my breakfast
 in my room.
[1517.20] Wasai, wait.
[1521.32] I will take care of it myself.
[1522.96] No one else will be able to make 
Areej quiet other than me.
[1526.20] Sure, elder madam.
[1629.92] Did you see?
[1631.32] Did you see how this magician taking
 over the entire environment.
[1635.52] Yes, I see it.
[1636.68] You are only seeing it, but 
you are not doing anything.
[1639.56] Shaista, we cannot bang our head on
the wall for no reason and call it an attempt.
[1648.80] We will have to make plans 
to break down the wall.
[1651.92] No Idrees,
[1653.88] you listen to me carefully.
[1659.88] We will never agree that 
she is Waqar’s daughter.
[1669.32] We will say she is a fraud.
[1675.48] She is lying to take over the wealth 
and business.
[1678.84] What are you saying, Shaista,
[1680.56] nowadays, you find out immediately 
through DNA testing.
[1683.32] I don’t know what all 
you are thinking.
[1692.28] I am going to the office.
[1726.92] We have two enemies in our home,
[1731.68] one is Arooj and 
the other is Mehreen.
[1738.84] Now we will do one thing,
[1740.48] we will tell Mehreen that 
Salman is not her son, but ours.
[1747.56] What will that do?
[1749.28] Mehreen will go mad 
out of shock.
[1754.44] But our target is Arooj,
[1756.32] on whose name 
the entire business is.
[1758.56] It is really important 
to defeat Arooj’s luck,
[1762.20] we don’t have time.
[1765.96] That’s why we will have 
to change the plan.
[1768.76] No. No, think of something else.
[1771.72] And remember we are going 
against the wind.
[1774.88] A little carelessness
[1777.48] will throw us at another spot.
[1781.80] Remember that.
[1802.16] That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.
[1804.08] Areej, you are really smart.
[1808.00] Grandma goes out a little and
 you call her immediately.
[1811.64] Who does this? 
Who does this? Huh?
[1814.32] Who does this? 
Areej does this.
[1816.88] Where is your mama? 
Where is your mama?
[1819.08] Call your mama. 
Mama. Mama.
[1823.04] She is not coming? 
Okay let’s call papa.
[1825.16] Papa.
[1826.88] Papa.
[1828.32] He is not coming.
[1829.84] Both are bad children, 
they left Areej alone.
[1833.88] They left my Areej alone.
[1836.20] Come we will sit and play, okay?
[1838.36] That’s how we play. 
You know how we play?
[1840.92] This is your papa’s first birthday gift,
[1846.08] which is with Areej right now.
[1853.24] See, how is it? Is it pretty?
[1855.48] Oh, my love.
[1857.64] Okay. That’s it. That’s it. 
That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.
[1860.64] That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. 
Areej wants her mama.
[1863.76] Shall we call mama? 
Mama.
[1866.20] Mama, come on,
 Areej is calling you.
[1871.32] Salman. 
Yes?
[1873.28] Try to come home early 
in the evening today.
[1876.64] Definitely.
[1879.68] By the way, can I say something?
[1880.72] Yes.
[1882.88] Mom’s temperament is changing.
[1885.68] You put her to a good task.
[1887.68] Her job is to love,
[1894.04] but she has seen so much 
difficulty in life that
[1897.92] her temperament has 
become bitter.
[1902.16] What difficulties?
[1913.40] Right now, I put Areej is her lap.
[1923.64] Rest will get fine on its own.
[1927.28] Everything is fine.
[1929.12] What more will get better?
[1939.36] You will find out everything 
when the time comes.
[1950.64] Okay,
[1951.88] I will go.
[1953.48] We will meet at night.
[1958.12] Take care of yourself.
[1959.68] You too. Goodbye.
[1962.40] Goodbye.
[2087.20] Why are you looking at me 
like that?
[2088.88] You called him.
[2091.56] Are you satisfied now?
[2093.44] You didn’t believe me?
[2097.08] It is not about believing 
you sister-in-law,
[2099.84] I just called him.
[2102.88] The children have their own life, 
Mehreen, let them live it.
[2107.76] Don’t monitor and dictate them
 all the time.
[2111.60] Hey, sister-in-law, what did I do?
[2114.88] I just spoke to my son.
[2116.52] Why do you forget that your son 
is also someone’s husband now.
[2122.04] Forgetting reminds me.
[2124.60] Salman is my son and I am helpless
that Arooj is my daughter in law.
[2131.96] But you are the only one who is
aware of things about them
[2135.40] and the mother knows nothing.
[2153.76] What is the matter?
[2156.80] Has a new life come to this home or
[2160.24] did someone die here?
[2168.00] I see sorrow on everyone’s face.
[2172.84] Mehreen, I am really happy.
[2175.80] In fact, we are all very happy.
[2184.12] It is just Arooj who is staying 
away from everyone.
[2194.64] I will not ask Arooj anything,
[2197.84] because the pain 
she went through,
[2200.36] after that a person suffers 
from depression.
[2203.80] And then Arooj has given 
my son a big gift.
[2208.28] My son is really happy.
[2216.44] This is amazing.
[2224.84] Mehreen who was Arooj’s enemy 
till yesterday,
[2246.12] today she is showering love on her.
[2258.84] What is this drama that is 
going on here?
[2269.12] Madam Arooj, what magic wand 
do you have
[2278.88] with which you have made someone 
like Mehreen your fan.
[2292.32] I will handle you too, Arooj.
