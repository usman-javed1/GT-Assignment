[74.20] She was trying to stay
awake for no reason
[77.20] to prove her love for Salman.
[83.63] I am his mother,
[84.97] I couldn’t even sleep for a moment.
[108.63] Aunt Shaista?
[110.87] Aunt Shaista?
[116.90] Aunt, she is sweating and
[118.73] her body is all cold.
[121.37] Aunt Shaista?
[124.43] I will go get the doctor.
[132.70] Sister-in-law? Sister-in-law?
[137.40] What happened to her?
[139.37] What should we do?
[141.13] Should I look after Salman or her?
[143.23] What the hell?
[151.87] What the hell?
[184.23] Where is Urooj gone?
[186.80] Looks like she is going to stay
with sister-in-law Shaista.
[189.97] I don’t know,
[190.77] when she didn’t have
the stamina to stay awake
[192.53] then why did she stay here?
[194.57] She doesn’t listen to anyone.
[214.03] Her blood pressure got
dangerously low
[216.93] But she was absolutely fine,
[219.23] what happened to
her all of a sudden?
[221.00] It often happens
when you don’t sleep,
[223.50] there is nothing to worry about,
[224.90] you may take her home
when this drip ends.
[228.80] Okay, fine, thank you.
[230.60] Excuse me.
[264.33] Where is sister-in-law Shaista?
[265.60] She is on a drip.
[268.53] Drip? But why?
[270.60] Her blood pressure got low
due to staying awake.
[273.83] What was the need for
her to stay awake
[275.60] when she didn’t have
the stamina?
[277.07] We just need attendants
in the hospital,
[279.23] not patients.
[280.27] But aunt, she is absolutely fine now.
[283.07] Do one thing, call brother Idrees and
ask him to take his wife away.
[287.20] No, I don’t think that is needed,
[289.13] she feels well.
[290.70] Will we take care of Salman
or sister-in-law Shaista,
[293.07] call brother Idrees?
[299.03] What should I do?
[300.40] She is after me.
[302.60] Let me make a fake call.
[314.60] Uncle Idrees’ number
is not going through.
[318.97] His number is not going through?
[320.50] Let me check myself.
[332.27] Greetings, brother Idrees,
[333.67] sister-in-law Shaista has gotten unwell,
[337.27] she is here in the emergency,
just come immediately.
[340.37] Yes. Bye.
[345.93] Hmph,
[347.27] I am Salman’s mother
[349.43] and she wanted to be like me.
[354.50] Did you see her love now,
[358.77] it’s like the paper flowers.
[412.03] Shaista, what happened?
[416.67] I don’t know,
[419.03] my blood pressure got low.
[422.67] Sister-in-law scared me.
[428.97] How are you, sister-in-law?
[434.20] I am fine.
[436.63] Brother Idrees,
[438.20] she is very weak,
[439.60] you must take her home.
[442.47] No, no, I will stay here with Salman.
[449.97] You are a patient yourself,
[451.60] we need healthy people here.
[453.90] You must go home.
[459.27] Yes Shaista, let’s go home.
[501.07] Mehreen was constantly
hitting me with sarcasm,
[506.97] she pushed me out of the hospital
and then got peace.
[515.17] You know that is how she is.
[520.40] Her brain works very well when
she has to make some scheme
[525.53] else, she is mentally weak.
[529.27] She can think of anything
when it comes to Salman,
[531.63] you must ignore her craze.
[533.90] My son is in the hospital
[536.03] and she kicked the mother
out of the hospital.
[562.53] Enough.
[564.03] Salman you have to
finish this soup.
[569.40] All right.
[577.80] I especially asked you
[579.70] to please drive carefully but you,
[583.30] you don’t listen to anyone
when you get angry.
[587.57] So, it’s good that at
least you found out.
[596.07] You are a very difficult person.
[600.30] Yes, I am very
difficult but for others,
[608.87] for you I am just a tad bit.
[618.63] Whenever I thought,
[622.33] you have always proved
my thinking wrong.
[628.53] Enough dude,
[630.67] now I am embarrassed that
what sort of a person I am
[633.57] No, there is nothing like that
[637.63] but do you know,
[643.97] that I used to feel that
[647.93] you were not a good person
[652.47] but then you even
proved that wrong.
[657.97] So then when you felt
I am a very nice person,
[661.47] then what happened?
[670.97] Then I fell in love with you
[680.77] but
[683.03] I actually got very scared when
I heard about your accident, Salman.
[688.93] What did you think?
[691.13] I was scared that something
might happen to you.
[696.57] Did anything happen?
[698.20] God forbid, anything happens
to you and please,
[700.53] now there shouldn’t
be any joke on this.
[703.70] All right,
[705.43] there won’t be any joke,
I am sorry.
[709.50] Come on, finish this now.
[712.67] Okay, I am having it.
[718.63] That’s it.
[726.47] Okay last.
[727.97] All right.
[730.47] my son slipped because of this,
[732.63] move it away, immediately
move it away.
[735.30] Madam Sr,
[736.90] the other madam has especially
put it over here
[740.47] and the younger sir didn’t
fell because of this but this.
[744.17] Enough,
[745.10] you are always arguing,
go away from here.
[747.33] yes , yes..
[751.00] Oh, what are you trying to prove
by taking so much care of him?
[756.67] What do you mean?
[757.60] All this has happened because of you.
[760.23] Because of me?
[761.60] Yes,
[762.50] if you hadn’t called him,
[764.33] he wouldn’t have picked up the call
[765.20] so he wouldn’t have been
distracted from driving.
[768.10] But when I called him,
Salman hung up absolutely fine.
[772.97] Okay so that means you are
trying to prove me wrong?
[820.83] Madam Jr, don’t worry,
[825.07] God will make everything right.
[828.53] You must go.
[860.47] Oh God, have mercy.
[908.27] You are crying, my child?
[911.57] Why was Mehreen shouting?
[918.20] Aunt says that the accident
happened because of me.
[921.47] She is wrong,
[923.07] I saw it myself,
[924.10] Mehreen was the one
who called him last.
[931.03] But she is not ready to accept this.
[933.33] So let her,
[935.20] she is habitual of this, my child.
[940.67] When you know so much,
[943.97] then why don’t you speak for me?
[947.07] There should be someone in
this house who can talk for me.
[1017.57] What happened, Urooj?
[1025.23] Do I not love you?
[1030.07] What sort of a question is that?
[1033.00] Obviously, you do.
[1038.77] That’s all I wanted to ask.
[1041.93] But why did you ask this?
[1044.50] because I don’t love
you so much that
[1046.50] I should suffocate you.
[1050.97] What sort of love is that
[1053.23] I should start causing harm to you?
[1056.80] Are you indirectly talking about Mom?
[1064.33] I guess,
[1069.77] According to Aunt Mehreen,
[1071.20] I am responsible for your accident,
[1073.33] it is because of me that
all this has happened.
[1076.53] God forbid,
why would I want that you…
[1078.53] This what mom has said to you?
[1082.47] Let me talk to her.
[1084.23] What will you say?
[1085.97] You will say something again
[1087.67] and she will blame me for everything.
[1095.20] I don’t care
[1097.20] when you didn’t do anything,
[1098.47] then why you should be blamed?
[1104.07] Let me talk to her, let me ask her.
[1159.47] What do you think?
[1160.90] That accidents happen
due to someone’s will?
[1164.60] I don’t feel anything like that.
[1166.83] Then why are you accusing
Urooj of my accident?
[1172.57] Oh,
[1176.27] okay,
[1178.13] so my Salman is here to argue
with his mother today
[1184.00] that don’t you dare say
anything to his wife.
[1188.87] There is nothing like that
[1191.73] but Urooj is worried too.
[1193.67] So, wasn’t I worried for my son?
[1196.77] My son’s car had an accident,
[1199.67] but he has been saved
after so many prayers.
[1203.87] You are right but…
[1205.37] No ifs and buts,
[1208.23] I knew it,
[1209.83] I knew that Urooj would one day prove
me wrong in front of my son.
[1214.37] Please mom, enough,
[1219.97] I remember it pretty clearly that
[1221.07] while I was driving you were the
last person who called me
[1223.97] but you are forgetting it.
[1233.63] Look, mom,
[1236.80] I know you are the
best in the world
[1240.37] I am just trying to say that
[1242.67] we should stop proving
each other right or wrong.
[1248.17] Do you understand what
I am saying?
[1323.07] Salman?
[1324.67] Hmm?
[1326.63] I wanted to ask you something.
[1331.07] Ask?
[1334.50] It is about your personality
so don’t get angry now.
[1340.70] What is it?
[1343.43] Aunt Mehreen and Aunt
[1345.90] are always trying to prove they
have similar rights over you,
[1351.47] and both of them are trying
to win from each other,
[1358.30] and you get all the pressure.
[1362.63] You are right.
[1368.27] I have been facing this forever.
[1370.60] Do you know what
I saw in the hospital?
[1377.70] What did you see?
[1381.30] When you were semi-conscious
and calling mom,
[1384.73] by the time aunt Mehreen would
have gotten up from her place,
[1387.43] aunt restlessly got to you.
[1394.67] Then what happened?
[1396.13] Then what?
[1397.43] Aunt Mehreen scolded
aunt a lot later on.
[1403.97] You have noticed
it absolutely correctly,
[1408.20] even I don’t understand that
[1409.43] why are they always
fighting so much for me?
[1422.27] I think Salman that
[1424.63] you must sit with both of
them and talk to them.
[1432.37] What happened?
[1436.27] I will definitely ask them when
I find the right time in life.
[1443.00] Anyway, mom is not in
the mood right now
[1446.13] so we can’t ask them anything.
[1452.37] Okay then, I will leave now, see you.
[1533.67] Urooj, my child, what are
you doing here alone?
[1537.43] Nothing uncle,
[1539.03] I was feeling suffocated inside
[1540.80] so thought I should come
stand outside in open air.
[1543.47] Okay, okay,
[1544.57] if that’s how it is let me
sit with you for a while,
[1547.37] you will feel better.
[1550.27] Sit down.
[1552.10] Thank you.
[1559.27] I feel that you are thinking
something.
[1564.43] uncle, I am thinking that
[1567.10] how can someone hate
anyone for loving?
[1572.40] Hate because of love?
I don’t understand, my child?
[1576.77] I mean to say that
[1578.83] aunt Shaista loves Salman as well
[1581.57] and aunt Mehreen loves him too
[1584.10] but they have a war between
each other for Salman’s love,
[1591.50] why is that so?
[1593.50] Umm,
[1594.90] Urooj my child, you must
not think about it at all
[1597.17] because it has been going on the
same way since Salman’s childhood.
[1600.23] Yeah.
[1600.87] Exactly, that is what
I want to know.
[1604.30] I mean, how can any aunt
love with so much intensity?
[1610.90] Umm actually Salman is the
only child of this house
[1615.70] so this snatching away
in love keeps on going on.
[1627.60] What happened?
[1628.67] You started thinking
something again?
[1631.70] Come on now, go inside,
[1633.87] you will stay outside
and get cold,  go rest.
[1635.93] Go inside, good girl.
you will keep on thinking,
[1639.50] Okay.
[1687.53] What happened?
[1688.80] why have you made
such a bad face?
[1691.87] you have forgotten to
control your emotions.
[1696.23] When have I not been careful?
[1699.13] I have been living life with so
many restrictions, so carefully.
[1702.50] If you are being careful then
[1703.77] why does this Urooj
who has just recently come
[1704.67] into our family is have doubts?
[1707.00] What doubt?
[1707.93] That you are always making a problem
out of Mehreen and Salman’s love.
[1711.90] Mehreen herself is responsible
for that too, no one else.
[1715.47] She is a mental patient.
[1717.83] that’s amazing,
[1719.83] she should do wrong with everyone
[1721.93] and she has the license of
being a mental patient?
[1725.33] I don’t want to argue with you,
[1727.40] you have to be careful, please.
[1760.63] Aunt Mehreen and
[1763.60] Aunt’s fight for Salman
is felt by everyone
[1772.73] and everyone even tells
it in their own words
[1777.70] but no one says that
[1781.20] there is nothing like that.
[1787.03] How she got aunt out
of the hospital room
[1792.47] but uncle,
[1796.70] uncle didn’t even discuss
it with anyone.
[1803.67] Aunt Mehreen behaves very strictly
[1811.63] but it’s surprising how
Aunt never counters.
[1872.80] Aunt?
[1875.30] Hey Urooj, my child,
[1879.03] Mehreen must have 
asked you not to meet me,
[1882.83] you have secretly come
 here to meet me, right?
[1886.23] Yes, that’s how it is,
[1888.97] but I don’t understand aunt
[1891.43] why does aunt Mehreen do that?
[1896.80] Actually, the thing is that
[1900.07] I love Salman a lot
[1903.70] and that is what Mehreen doesn’t like,
[1911.47] she thinks everything
that is Salman’s is hers
[1918.13] and then you are his wife,
[1920.80] won’t she show off her rights on you?
[1923.07] Hmmm
[1925.17] Now do you understand?
[1929.93] So then, that picture in your room
[1935.17] with a child in your lap,
[1937.83] who is that?
[1939.03] That is Salman,
[1941.47] he was that young,
[1943.83] and I have been raising 
him since then,
[1949.67] that is why I love him so much.
[1953.93] It means that
[1957.40] you never had a child of your own?
[1964.93] hah! Yes, just consider it that.
[2010.17] Let me go inside.
[2012.47] You cannot go inside,
[2014.67] your wife will come here.
[2016.53] okay, okay.
[2022.20] What are you here for?
[2025.37] Don’t you know I have found this 
house with so much difficulty.
[2029.77] But why have you come?
[2032.33] Hey I don’t have
 money for my medicine,
[2035.60] give me money for medicine.
[2037.67] What medicine?
[2038.70] What has happened to you?
[2040.30] Don’t you know? What medicine?
[2043.27] The medicine that I… That medicine.
[2049.10] For God’s sake leave my life,
[2052.43] you must go from here, go!
[2054.70] I don’t have more money 
for your addiction.
[2058.80] Don’t do that Wasai, 
give me money,
[2061.30] what do you do with all the money 
that you earn? Tell me? Tell me?
[2066.43] I send it to Behram
[2068.63] who put money in your case
[2071.53] else you would in 
the prison right now,
[2074.47] go, go away.
[2076.03] Give it to me Wasai,
[2077.47] don’t do this, give it to me.
[2079.77] Give it to me else I will die,
 give it to me.
[2084.30] Wait, I will give.
[2093.83] What are you doing.
[2097.97] Wasai, you are very good,
[2101.17] you are very good,
 you are very good,
[2104.13] you are very good.
[2146.30] Where are you lost, my friend?
[2150.03] It’s good that you came Nasir,
[2153.20] I am tired of living a monotonous life.
[2157.00] What are you saying?
[2161.80] You have an ideal life,
[2164.30] well-established business,
[2166.33] and a loving wife,
[2168.33] what else does a man want?
[2169.33] I want peace.
[2173.43] I don’t have peace in life.
[2175.80] What happened? 
Any business problem?
[2178.23] No there are no 
business problems,
[2180.63] family problems.
[2183.70] You have romance around you
[2187.17] and don’t forget that
[2188.43] you had a love marriage.
[2190.80] I feel like
[2194.80] I have been sandwiched between
 the triangle of Urooj, aunt and mom.
[2202.77] Hmm, so that’s the case.
[2206.57] I don’t understand there is always 
some problem in the house,
[2210.77] there are always fights,
[2214.10] Urooj is always upset,
[2216.77] I am so worried.
[2218.90] Salman, it has been such 
less time to your marriage,
[2222.00] these are the days 
of your enjoyment.
[2225.10] I don’t even remember 
I had a love marriage.
[2230.50] Do one thing,
[2232.80] you must take sister-in-law for 
a long drive at night
