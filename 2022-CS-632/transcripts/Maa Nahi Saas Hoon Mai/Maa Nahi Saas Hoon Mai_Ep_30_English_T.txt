[28.28] Madam, your tea.
[31.20] Yeah, keep it there.
[32.48] Okay.
[39.48] Where is Idrees?
[41.72] In Madam Sr’s room.
[47.00] What is he doing there?
[48.88] he is… He is,
[52.64] actually, I don’t know madam.
[55.64] Wasai, you know everything,
[61.80] did you go to her room?
[65.76] yes.
[66.96] what were they talking about?
[69.08] Umm, they were talking
 about Madam Jr.
[76.64] About Arooj?
[79.40] What were they saying?
[82.56] Maybe Sir doesn’t want
[85.64] Madam Jr to work at the office.
[89.88] Not maybe,
[91.64] Idrees for sure doesn’t want it.
[94.08] Yes.
[95.96] I don’t know why does I
drees has a problem
[98.48] with Arooj going to the office.
[101.12] Mehreen is already negative 
from Arooj’s side,
[105.12] I don’t know what new 
scheme is he planning.
[108.12] Madam Jr is very nice, madam.
[114.16] Do you know when
 she talks to me,
[118.76] I don’t feel like a servant at all.
[123.36] You are right,
[125.44] Arooj has a very nice nature.
[130.72] Okay you may go.
[132.92] Okay.
[143.28] I’ll go check myself
 what is going on there.
[178.08] So what did you guys plan then?
[180.60] Plan? About what?
[183.24] About Arooj?
[187.40] You were talking to Mehreen, right?
[190.28] Who told you?
[191.52] Forget about that
[193.12] just tell me that why
are you after Arooj?
[199.96] After all what did the 
innocent girl do to you?
[203.28] Why are you always 
defending Arooj?
[205.92] Because I don’t have any
 reason to be against her,
[211.08] if you have it then let me know.
[213.12] These are official matters
 so don’t interfere.
[215.84] If I cannot interfere 
in office matters
[219.04] then why do you want
 Mehreen to interfere,
[224.60] it is strange,
[226.40] a woman went to the office
[228.28] and the other woman is being 
informed about every moment,
[233.12] and if the third woman 
asks something,
[235.08] so she is not allowed 
to even talk about it?
[238.64] I don’t have an answer
 to your question.
[240.96] It is a very prominent, Idrees,
[243.24] it is about 2+2=4,
[245.44] how will you answer?
[250.68] Anyways, tell me,
[253.24] what problem do you
 have with Arooj?
[255.36] she is asking about 6.5 million
 marble that where did it go?
[259.24] So then give her the accounts.
[260.64] What do I know where they went?
[262.64] What do you mean?
[263.76] It’s not a needle that
 you wouldn’t know.
[308.88] Salman,
[310.08] Hmm
[312.88] I feel that we should do 
company’s audit.
[317.12] we just got it done 2 months back,
[319.60] it will happen next year now.
[321.92] I am not talking about annual audit,
[326.60] I want to get a special audit done.
[334.16] Why? Is there a problem?
[338.44] I see some miscalculations 
in accounts.
[344.96] They get all the receipts ready by 
the year end and bring it to us,
[352.04] I think the audit should take 
place all of a sudden,
[354.76] that would be better.
[357.80] But Arooj, according to me,
 everything is going on smooth.
[362.76] Salman,
[365.04] I see something wrong with 
the company accounts.
[370.92] Arooj, you are having 
a misunderstanding,
[373.28] doing that creates doubts,
[375.92] the rates of the stock 
market can go down too
[378.28] because people start trusting less.
[384.12] So I think just let it be.
[390.52] As you wish,
[393.16] I was talking for the 
benefit of the company.
[399.84] Come in.
[405.28] Yes, Wasai? What is it?
[406.92] Actually,
[408.32] Madam Sr is calling both of you.
[414.68] Okay tell her we are coming.
[417.12] Okay.
[428.28] Shall we go?
[428.84] Hmm.
[429.84] Come.
[450.56] Yes mom? Did you call us?
[452.96] Yes.
[456.56] I have made a decision.
[460.96] What decision.
[463.00] I will come to the office
 too from tomorrow.
[476.68] She got psycho episode again.
[480.40] Office,
[482.40] but what will you do at the office?
[484.72] Whatever Arooj does there.
[495.76] Mom, Arooj looks after accounts.
[498.96] I will look after something too.
[502.28] Mom, why are you being stubborn?
[504.56] Everyone will make 
fun of me at the office.
[506.44] Really?
[508.04] It’s fine if Arooj goes to the office
[510.00] and if I go it will be a joke,
[511.96] it is logical?
[515.04] Okay fine,
[517.28] tell me what do you want?
[521.24] Just that if Arooj will go to the office,
[524.84] I will go too.
[532.24] Rest is up to you.
[564.24] So then what did you decide?
[567.68] Arooj, I cannot take
 this drama anymore.
[571.08] Why is this drama created at all?
[573.12] What do I know?
[577.56] Things have gotten 
way beyond this question.
[579.76] That’s what happens every time,
[581.48] things get out of our hands.
[583.36] Arooj, I don’t want to debate on it,
[585.84] I will be made a joke at the office.
[590.76] What will people say that
[592.48] the game of mother-in-law and daughter
 in law is being played in my office too?
[597.24] I kind of have an idea
 what you would say
[603.28] but I just want to ask that
[606.68] what will be your decision?
[611.80] Arooj, you know how 
stubborn mom is,
[617.60] I will have to unwillingly
 stop you to stop her.
[625.72] Hmm,
[628.32] it means,
[631.04] my idea was absolutely right.
[637.92] What idea?
[638.96] Anyways,
[640.52] I have aligned interviews for new 
accounts manager tomorrow.
[645.48] I will conduct them.
[646.88] No,
[648.96] I accepted what you said,
[653.84] now you will have to 
accept my decision too.
[714.24] Arooj, my child, 
what are you doing here?
[718.20] Nothing,
[720.84] I felt like breathing in fresh air.
[725.00] Yes,
[727.04] Mehreen is an expert in 
creating suffocation,
[731.96] in relationships, in hearts,
[735.24] in the environment.
[741.00] If it was in her control,
[742.20] she would even stop 
us from breathing.
[747.24] What can I say?
[749.84] She is my elder,
[751.48] it is obligatory for 
me to respect her.
[755.20] Okay fine,
[757.04] then you keep on
 fulfilling your obligation
[759.52] and Mehreen will keep 
on doing her work.
[766.36] Anyway,
[767.96] what does Salman say now?
[773.80] I won’t be going to office 
from tomorrow.
[778.88] Salman has to do all that
[781.92] Mehreen forces her to do.
[789.20] What can the innocent guy do?
[792.76] No one can do anything.
[795.64] Salman is not letting 
you go to the office,
[797.52] I understand that
[799.20] because he is very obedient
 towards Mehreen
[804.88] but I don’t understand the 
fact that why is Idrees after you?
[814.16] You tell me if you
 know something?
[818.12] What can I say?
[821.08] I guess because
[824.72] he might not be understanding 
my way of working.
[828.16] Yes, maybe,
[830.52] he is a man from old generation,
[833.04] he is habitual of 
working his own way.
[841.04] It means you won’t be going 
to the office from tomorrow?
[845.80] Yes, I guess.
[896.72] Madam Sr, I have 
served the breakfast.
[899.92] Call Arooj too.
[902.24] Okay.
[902.92] Leave it, Wasai,
[906.24] you may go, we are coming.
[908.88] As you wish.
[913.44] When she doesn’t have 
to go to the office,
[915.20] she will even have the 
breakfast later on.
[917.36] Come let’s have breakfast.
[925.16] Greetings, aunt.
[928.64] Greetings.
[933.88] It looks like you guys didn’t
 understand what I said.
[940.52] Aunt, we have obeyed your orders.
[943.56] So then why are you dressed
 to go to the office?
[947.32] A person should move on in life,
[950.40] if there is a hinderance on way,
[953.04] one should create a new way.
[955.36] What is she saying, Salman,
[959.40] will you tell me?
[964.20] Is Arooj going to the office?
[966.52] Mom, don’t worry,
[969.72] we have accepted what you said.
[972.88] Come, let’s have breakfast.
[1004.36] Where are you taking me, Salman?
[1007.28] Come, there is a surprise for you.
[1010.32] Surprise, okay?
[1012.00] Is this blind fold important for it?
[1014.16] Very important.
[1014.96] Okay let’s see what your surprise is.
[1019.64] Where?
[1020.60] Just wait for 2 minutes,
[1022.44] you wait will be over.
[1026.80] When will your surprise end?
[1029.84] Just wait a minute.
[1044.04] What is all this?
[1045.52] Whose office is this?
[1046.56] You cut the ribbon first.
[1061.60] welcome to new office, Aunt.
[1067.92] Whose office is it?
[1069.72] You said that Arooj shouldn’t
 be going to the office,
[1072.04] so I brought the office home.
[1074.52] This is Arooj’s new office.
[1097.56] Mom? Mom?
[1112.44] Don’t worry,
[1114.36] I will talk to her.
[1117.36] Congratulations to you 
on your new office.
[1218.56] Welcome to new office, Aunt.
[1224.84] Whose office is it?
[1226.68] You said that Arooj shouldn’t
 be going to the office,
[1229.00] so I brought the office home.
[1231.48] This is Arooj’s new office.
[1266.80] Madam Sr, your tea?
[1271.40] Who asked you to get tea for me?
[1274.40] Madam did.
[1279.20] Madam asked me to take tea for you.
[1282.84] Okay fine, keep it there.
[1285.64] Okay.
[1303.04] Cleverness with me? Mehreen?
[1315.72] Arooj, it will cost you a lot.
[1324.80] Let’s see how long this 
office stays intact for.
[1366.88] Sister-in-law Shaista,
[1368.96] I want to talk to you about 
something very important.
[1371.20] Sure, go ahead?
[1372.68] You think all this is right?
[1376.40] What?
[1378.16] That the office has come in home?
[1381.84] So what’s wrong in it Mehreen?
[1387.32] This is good,
[1389.04] it is good for you.
[1391.36] Good for you? How?
[1395.24] You wanted to go to the office,
[1397.60] now the office has come near,
[1399.56] so you join the office now.
[1401.80] Sister-in-law, I wanted to join
 Salman’s office,
[1404.68] this is Arooj’s office.
[1407.60] I will never step inside her 
office even with good intentions.
[1412.76] It’s not making 
difference to anyone.
[1417.24] Coocoo.
[1439.12] Madam,
[1441.24] the last candidate for accounts
 department is waiting.
[1444.68] Send him.
[1445.76] Okay.
[1464.76] Yes come in.
[1468.00] Good morning, ma’am.
[1470.36] Good Morning.
[1478.00] Ammad?
[1479.28] Arooj?
[1480.08] You?
[1481.40] Oh my God,
[1483.00] what a pleasant surprise.
[1485.48] Come, sit please.
[1486.64] Thank you.
[1493.12] You never contacted after university,
[1495.40] you disappeared somewhere.
[1497.04] Madam, you are the one who is lost,
[1498.40] how could have I contacted?
[1502.28] By the way,
[1503.44] you have achieved what you had to,
[1506.40] good.
[1507.36] Hmm,
[1508.56] I achieved it and you?
[1511.12] Won’t you tell me about yourself?
[1513.12] A middle class boy is always
 after making his future,
[1516.96] we don’t even study to study.
[1520.32] College, university, we just
 go there for a good job.
[1524.56] The same old style,
[1526.64] the same revolutionary talks.
[1528.24] Yes, my talks have just been talks,
[1531.92] I couldn’t bring the revolution.
[1533.16] You can’t even bring it.
[1536.64] So where were you for so many
 years? What did you do?
[1539.72] I was in the US,
[1541.24] I was also studying there and
[1542.80] working along with it too
[1543.88] now don’t ask what was the work 
that I was doing there.
[1547.68] Yes, but
[1548.88] I would just tell that 
my clothes still like petrol.
[1555.68] Okay so, you didn’t get married.
[1560.08] How could have I gotten married
 when you got married?
[1564.00] You didn’t stop flirting yet?
[1568.48] Come on, I was joking,
[1569.96] you are a very good friend of mine.
[1572.56] Okay, tell me,
[1573.32] will you give me the job after 
conducting the interview or not?
[1577.60] Hmm, so,
[1580.68] when would you like to join?
[1582.52] Ma’am, I am a poor person,
[1584.44] I will join you from today if you want.
[1588.76] Okay then,
[1590.24] you are about to get a special 
task on your first day of job.
[1594.32] And I hope you will be
 able to understand it.
[1598.12] Work on this file and update me.
[1601.44] Thank you.
[1612.48] Make me speak to Amna.
[1618.12] yes madam?
[1619.16] Yes, come to my room.
[1620.44] Okay.
[1633.08] yes ma’am.
[1634.68] Amna, this is Mr. Ammad,
[1637.16] manager of our 
Finance Department.
[1640.00] Show him his seat and
[1641.88] introduce him to the 
rest of the staff too.
[1643.72] Okay.
[1645.20] Thank you, thank you so much.
[1646.44] Good luck.
[1647.28] Thank you.
[1696.36] I asked you to bring the 
file from the record room
[1698.60] and you have come empty handed?
[1700.12] Boss, the record room is empty.
[1703.92] What do you mean by it’s empty?
[1705.48] You will have to check all
 the data on your laptop,
[1708.16] all the files have gone home.
[1712.24] How did so many things go out of the 
office without my permission?
[1717.76] Record keeper was saying it happened 
on Madam Arooj’s orders.
[1722.88] I even took your name
[1724.72] but he said that Madam Arooj
 is director finance and
[1727.60] Mr. Salman has said that 
her orders should be followed.
[1733.36] Boss, I got so worried that 
how did it happen?
[1737.40] Arooj is very smart.
[1742.04] Now she will be sitting at home
[1744.32] and reading every line.
[1747.00] So let her, we have an answer 
to every question.
[1749.96] But we don’t have an answer
 to where did 1000 sq ft marble go.
[1753.40] Can you give me anything else
 apart from tensions?
[1757.88] Boss, I am your sympathizer,
[1760.36] you wanted to get Madam
 Arooj out of the office,
[1764.52] she called the office at home itself.
[1769.28] Go.
[1787.64] Mr. Farhan, what is the 
protocol of all the files
[1789.96] of our projects that are uploaded 
on the computer?
[1793.12] Madam, you, Mr. Salman and 
Mr. Idrees has access to these files.
[1797.80] Okay
[1799.52] then only I and Mr. Salman will the
 access to this from now on.
[1803.20] Okay, madam.
[1805.20] Okay,
[1806.24] so warehouse, sales, marketing,
[1808.92] change passwords for all of these.
[1810.92] Okay madam.
[1812.92] And yes,
[1814.20] check everyone’ screens 
and share it with me.
[1816.80] Okay, I will do as you said.
[1819.20] Don’t say you will, do it already, 
Mr. Farhan, right now,
[1823.56] got it?
[1824.52] Yes, madam, don’t worry.
[1826.52] Thank you.
[1836.04] I will solve all these 
loopholes at any cost.
[1862.52] What happened? 
Why have you made this face?
[1865.28] Boss,
[1866.88] the space is getting narrower.
[1869.32] What has happened?
[1870.80] All the files have already
 been taken home,
[1873.32] now we cannot even 
check from the computer.
[1878.40] Who did this?
[1879.48] IT manager sent an email that
[1881.88] only Madam Arooj and 
Mr. Salman has an access to it.
[1890.96] So then how will we work now?
[1894.52] Boss, there are no 
restrictions on new files.
[1915.68] The house has become
 so lively today
[1920.20] else there is always silence here,
[1924.40] people are coming and going,
[1927.84] boys with ties, girls,
[1930.00] girls are a little too fashionable.
[1935.32] Anyway, what do I have to do with it,
[1936.96] Madam jr has asked 
me to make tea.
[1940.96] Wasai will just make tea.
[1951.04] Madam sr, do you need something?
[1955.20] So many cups?
[1957.44] Who have you made 
so much tea for?
[1959.68] Actually, people from Madam
 Jr’s office are here,
[1963.28] there are these many people.
[1968.96] This Arooj has ruined all 
the discipline of our house.
[1975.60] She has ruined the peaceful
 environment of the house.
[1979.68] This is our home,
[1981.00] let it be a home and
don’t make it an office.
[1983.28] Okay,
[1984.84] Madam Sr, the tea is done now,
[1988.20] I will go give it.
[1989.92] I can see that the tea is made.
[1993.68] Do one thing, pour it in the sink.
[1997.28] What?
[1998.24] I am asking you to pour it in the sink,
[2001.12] do you understand?
[2003.20] yes
[2027.16] I am really sorry Uncle,
[2029.28] actually there are some issues 
of the marketing department,
[2032.32] I was emailing them.
[2034.88] Yes, yes, yes, I know,
[2036.48] even I gave them 
some advices but
[2038.36] that’s not what 
I am here to talk about now.
[2041.04] coffee?
[2045.76] Hello?
[2048.00] Umm, yes send two 
cups of coffee,
[2050.60] thank you.
[2052.76] Yes, tell me?
[2055.84] My son, what is all this?
[2057.12] It is such a huge company,
 the name is ours
[2059.04] and the entire office is
 being run from home.
[2062.20] Uncle, not the entire office,
[2064.40] I have just shifted the 
finance department home.
[2068.28] And I guess you are
 forgetting that
[2070.72] we have ran office from
 home in the lock down days.
[2074.84] My child, it was a different problem,
[2076.44] it feels unnecessary to me right now,
[2078.52] Personal life and office 
should be kept separately.
[2083.00] So, what can I do?
[2086.28] Mom is being stubborn at 
one place and then
[2089.08] there is Arooj’s wish at the other end.
[2090.80] And you?
[2091.92] Do you have any of your 
own wish or will?
[2095.60] I just want both of them to be happy.
[2101.28] I don’t mind anything else.
[2111.48] What happened uncle, 
what are you thinking?
[2114.64] yes, nothing, son, nothing,
[2118.08] the coffee hasn’t come yet?
[2120.76] Okay did you speak to Ali associations?
[2124.56] Yes, I am coordinating with them,
[2127.76] I will also arrange a meeting soon and
[2129.20] will finalize too.
[2133.24] Perfect.
[2135.40] Hello?
[2136.44] Yes, send the coffee, 
we are waiting.
[2139.64] Thank you.
[2141.24] So, what’s up Mom?
[2142.80] You didn’t come to meet,
[2145.04] it has been so long that
[2146.48] I haven’t seen your face,
[2148.12] a mother cannot resist,
[2150.28] so I came here.
[2152.04] Everything is in front of you,
[2153.88] there is so much work that 
I don’t get any time.
[2156.36] My child,
[2157.52] you have to take out time
 for your loved ones.
[2161.12] Hmm,
[2162.00] you are absolutely right
[2164.28] but what can I do mom,
[2166.20] by the time I get done with office,
[2168.20] its night, I don’t get time.
[2172.16] By the way,
[2173.48] Arooj, why did you need all this?
[2178.44] You left such a huge office
[2180.48] and made office at home?
[2188.56] Because,
[2192.00] Aunt Mehreen doesn’t want
 me to go to the office
[2196.48] and I don’t want to
 leave this department
[2199.88] that is why I had to do all this.
[2201.72] What is the reason for all this?
[2203.92] And what was so important, my child?
[2210.76] I will definitely tell you 
at the right time,
[2214.40] don’t worry.
[2223.64] You were saying that this is an office.
[2227.16] How are you sister Mehreen?
[2231.24] This is an office,
[2232.88] lower your tone, my staff works here.
[2237.88] Not yours, Salman’s staff
[2241.20] and if this is an office
[2243.44] then why have you made an environment
 like it is your parents’ house?
