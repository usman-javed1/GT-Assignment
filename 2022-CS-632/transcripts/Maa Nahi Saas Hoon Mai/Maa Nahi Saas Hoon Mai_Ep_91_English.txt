Arooj, what you did was not right. What did I do? I brought the truth 
in front of everyone. Why do you not like it this much? You have attacked my position 
in this home, you will have to pay the price for it. Be quiet. Right now, you are not in 
a position to threaten me. And as much as you have 
conspired against me, I have paid the price for it 
a long time back. I am only taking revenge from you. How many times did I tell you not to try to poison my life 
with Salman? But sadly, despite me asking you a thousand times,
 you didn’t listen to me once. Actually, you know why? Because you enjoy ruining 
the homes of others. What do you think, will that 
Mussarat be able to prove anything? This is not true. You will not be able 
to win this time either. This has nothing to do 
with my win or loss. She is your second wife, 
keep her with respect, make your home. And also let me live 
my life peacefully. So, then, victory is yours, right? What is wrong younger madam? Is everything fine? I hope everything will be 
fine really soon. Salman, son, come home immediately. See what your father has done 
with your own eyes. Shaista. Shaista, listen to me. I am telling you, that I don’t know
that woman. I didn’t ask you this. Huh? I will not give you any chance 
to give justifications. I am making way to the wealth, by defeating Mehreen and Arooj, and you have wives. Hey, those wedding papers are fake. Why are you worried? It is fake. I am not worried. Understand 
what I am saying. I am not from amongst those wives, who sits down to cry seeing their husband
in a relation with some other woman. I have a young son. Now he will deal with these matters. Salman? Why are you involving Salman
 in these matters, he has to do a lot of things
in business. Why are you worried? You just said that woman is a liar. Yes, she… So, we will see. Salman is coming home 
from the office. Pray that woman turns out 
to be a liar. Pick up the phone uncle. I feel you are getting calls 
from two places. I will answer it, it is my issue. By the way, you have two numbers, right? No, I just have one number. Oh, no, then you must have confusion. When the first one would call, you would take the name of the second and when the second one calls, 
you would take the name of the first. What do you want? You are really worried 
from my questions. I am surprised, the one who answers 
to the entire world has no answer for me today. Hello. Nawaz. Yes, boss? You didn’t come to the office today. Leave that and tell me did 
Mussarat come to the office? No boss, she didn’t come, 
if you want, I can call her. Stop your nonsense and 
hear what I am saying. Mussarat came here with my son. At home? Who brought her there? Who can bring her? I have just one enemy, Arooj. Now you keep your eyes and 
ears open and if you see Mussarat there, 
then call me immediately. Got it? Yes, boss. I am not from amongst those wives, who sits down to cry seeing their husband
in a relation with some other woman. I have a young son. Now he will deal with these matters. Salman? Why are you involving Salman
in these matters, he has to do a lot of things 
in business. Why are you worried? You just said that woman is a liar. Yes, she… So, we will see. Salman is coming home 
from the office. Pray that woman turns out 
to be a liar. What will happen when 
Salman finds out? I am Idree’s wife and we have been married 
for fourteen years. Fourteen years? Idrees, what is she saying? Answer me. She is saying you married her. Hey, I don’t know who 
this woman is. Really? Then I am sure you don’t even
recognize your son. And you must not even 
recognize this ring Did you see? Your maternal and paternal 
grandma has two princesses. One is princess Arooj and one is princess Areej. Love. Salman? Meaning, the mother has called her son against his father. Maybe these people will have their
attention diverted from mama and I, getting stuck in these worries. Mom. Mom. Salman is here. Mama, Salman didn’t call you. What had to happen, what had 
to pass, has passed. Now you don’t have to pull me back
in my past, aunt Mehreen. You called me aunty? Yes, I did, and I will call you aunty 
in future too. All of you, especially you, ruined my life. To save your life you took away
 my entire childhood. Salman…
Get away. Go away. You don’t need to come 
in front of me in future. Salman. You have found your daughter, save these emotions for her. He is calling his mother, then who am I? Am I not his mother? Salman has changed so much. This is how a mother’s love 
is being repaid. What is the matter, mom? You had called. 
Is everything fine? Son, she came, she sat here, 
and she left suddenly. What do you mean 
who sat here? Who? His second wife. Second wife? What do you mean? 
What are you saying? I don’t understand. When you left for office, immediately a woman came and said she is his second wife. Hey, she was lying. She was lying. I don’t know if she was speaking 
the truth or lying, but she had wedding papers… Hey, I said those were fake. Can I complete what I am saying? It is a matter of my respect and you 
want to complete what you were saying? I have told you, what relation will I have with another 
woman with you there? And you got fooled by her. If she was honest, then 
she would be sitting here. Yes. Whoever she was, honest or liar,
but why did she come here? Son, only Arooj can tell us this. What do you mean? What does Arooj have to do 
with this matter? Yes, Arooj called her here. And she introduced her to me 
as Mrs. Idrees Ahmad. She is really cunning, son. She knows that she can only 
take over the wealth when there are misunderstandings 
between us or else, who do I have other than you 
or Shaista? Huh? Where is Arooj? Arooj. Arooj. Your issues will not get resolved, the politics at home will continue. 
I am going to the office. Will I lie about such a big thing? Okay enough. 
One second. One second. This allegation that 
you are putting, do you have any proof of this? So, tell me, do you have proof, that whatever you are saying is true. Why are you quiet? 
Speak up. The only proof a woman 
has is her wedding. Our wedding is proof of this, and I have the wedding papers. What happened Salman? What nonsense is this? What did I do? Will you not stop your cunningness? What is my fault? What is your fault? Did you not have shame in putting 
allegation on a man as old as your father. I have not put any allegation. Uncle got married and getting 
married is not a sin. Arooj, don’t talk senseless things 
in front of me, I am telling you. I didn’t say anything senseless. Arooj, I am warning you, stop all this 
or you will see the worst in me. I am speaking the truth, Salman. I met her myself, I went to her home.
I called her here. If you talk to her, 
she will tell you everything… Stop your nonsense. You say you are honest, right? Yes. Then fine, you have till the evening 
to prove yourself or else you will apologize to dad 
in front of everyone. Where did she go? Arooj, I had told you that Shaista would turn out to be a 
much worse mother-in-law than Mehreen. See my prediction. At times I feel you are not 
being treated good. I feel you have holes
 in your hands. Check. Check. See, 
if I am right or not. No, you won’t be able to see it, 
but I can see that you have a hole 
in your hands. Because when Salman would be
a good husband, you couldn’t control Mehreen, and when you got the relation 
of your mother, then the husband got distanced 
from you. I feel you don’t know 
how to live in relations.
