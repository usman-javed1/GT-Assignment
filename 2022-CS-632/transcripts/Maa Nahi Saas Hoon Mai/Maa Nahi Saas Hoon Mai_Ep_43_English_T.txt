[42.12] If you keep on thinking like this,
[45.08] you will die of starving one day.
[47.08] Umm, I think so, the rest is up to you.
[56.52] Arooj, look your situation has quite…
[59.12] I mean our situation has gone 
quite bad,
[64.08] you have to do something
[66.52] else I will leave this city.
[70.96] What do you mean?
[72.52] You will leave me alone once again?
[75.16] Yes, because all of this is happening 
because of him,
[79.28] if you wouldn’t have helped 
Arooj this much,
[81.36] brother Salman wouldn’t have had 
this doubt in his heart at all.
[85.52] Look, you just shut up,
[87.72] we are talking about a serious 
thing here.
[89.24] So you think I am nonserious?
[91.92] Whatever the problem is going on here, 
I am taking it seriously.
[94.84] If that’s the case then find a solution
to this problem.
[99.84] Yes, yes, definitely, why not?
[106.92] Arooj, you tell me,
[109.72] what should be done?
[111.84] Ammad,
[113.20] I have collected all the proofs 
against Uncle
[116.92] but the people whose names 
are connected with him,
[119.52] they are huge businessmen,
[121.36] they are renowned in the market,
[123.00] they have big companies
[125.04] and Salman’s company also 
has a reputation.
[128.04] Yes, they all will be defamed like this 
and no company would want that.
[131.52] Exactly,
[132.68] that is why we also need witnesses 
along with the proofs.
[135.92] And the companies that are involved 
in this matter
[138.92] will never give statements.
[141.20] Okay let’s suppose,
[142.92] even if we force someone 
and bring them
[145.32] and they even give a statement 
against Uncle, then?
[148.96] You know what will happen then?
[150.68] Neither Salman will do business 
with them,
[152.84] nor Uncle will do business with Salman.
[156.28] Hey, why are you guys going 
around in circles?
[158.96] We just need one witness,
[160.88] you guys were telling me about that 
house where that marble was sold,
[164.68] people who live there are not 
from the market,
[166.68] they would be a family,
take statement from them.
[169.28] I think, good idea
[171.92] but we don’t know the people 
who live there,
[175.24] we have just met the gatekeeper there
and he is very rude
[178.44] and he will never let us go inside.
[183.12] We will go inside the bungalow
[185.68] and all the secrets will be out.
[190.08] You guys are such fools,
[192.48] both of you know it very well 
when Shanzey is done having lunch,
[195.68] her brain starts functioning efficiently.
[199.52] Hmm, I can see how efficient 
madam’s brain is functioning.
[204.48] Very funny.
[205.76] Dude, you guys don’t watch films. 
Okay listen, I have a plan.
[250.96] Shaista, you just get stuck
 on one thing.
[253.48] You are the one who is stuck 
on ruining Salman’s life,
[257.84] forgetting the fact that 
Salman is our son,
[263.32] we have just given him to Mehreen 
to save her life.
[268.12] I haven’t forgotten anything, 
how can someone forget their son?
[271.28] Tell me.
[273.44] Idrees, promise me one thing.
[276.80] What promise? 
Okay I do,
[279.32] I will accept whatever you say, 
tell me, what is it?
[281.80] Idrees, promise me that you will never interfere
 in Salman and Arooj’s matter ever again.
[291.32] Salman is our son,
[294.32] Arooj is our daughter-in-law.
[298.68] Looking at the intensity of 
Salman’s love for Arooj,
[303.08] I am scared that
[306.36] just because of the fire lit 
by you and Mehreen,
[309.40] he might harm himself.
[314.64] Okay promise, I accept 
what you are saying. Hang up.
[318.76] Thank you. Take care.
[330.36] I had someone very close to my heart,
[335.16] I am breaking for her.
[339.48] I know,
[342.36] I know who you are speaking about.
[345.52] I left the whole world and chose her,
[352.08] I went against my mother for her.
[356.96] And what did she do?
[360.60] What did Arooj do?
[366.68] Disloyalty.
[422.76] We have to wait here.
[425.68] Arooj cannot come until 
the guard leaves.
[431.92] Call Arooj.
[433.28] Yes.
[440.76] yes, Arooj, don’t come right now, 
the guard is sitting here.
[445.44] okay I will let you know.
[448.28] dude, when will he leave?
[449.68] Why isn't he leaving?
[455.68] Hello?
[457.76] Yes, madam, yes,
[459.72] okay madam, I am just coming 
in 2 minutes.
[493.60] Call Arooj, quickly.
Yes.
[495.00] Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[501.28] Hello? Arooj?
[503.16] Arooj, The guard is leaving, 
come quickly. Immediately.
[506.44] Okay.
[518.88] Where is this Arooj?
[562.16] Best of luck.
[604.52] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[606.68] Is your mom home? 
Yes.
[608.48] May I come in and meet her. 
Yes, come in.
[642.08] You go sit inside, I will just 
call mom right now.
[644.88] Okay.
[689.24] Oh!
[692.24] So the stolen marble and tiles 
have been used here.
[697.28] Wow.
[699.84] Someone has made such a 
royal bungalow with stolen items.
[779.36] Uncle?
[790.56] It means that
[795.60] Uncle has secretly done 
another marriage.
[802.88] What did I come here for and
[807.40] a new Pandora's box opened here.
[833.84] I think I should leave.
[882.04] Who has come, son?
[885.52] There is no one here.
[888.08] An Aunt came here.
[890.92] If she came,
[893.92] where did she go then?
[897.40] You go and call the Guard,
[901.64] how did he let anyone in?
[905.24] You sent him to get the groceries.
[910.24] Wait a minute, who are you? 
And how did you go inside?
[915.56] Listen to me, who are you?
[919.36] How did you go inside?
[922.04] Wait, brother who are you?
[923.32] I am asking you to stop, 
who are you? Stop.
[928.08] Who were these people? 
And how did they go inside?
[931.40] If boss finds out he will kill me
[934.60] and even fire me from work.
[941.68] Arooj, at least tell something, 
what happened after all?
[945.44] I feel she hasn’t been very successful.
[950.96] But unless you tell us anything,
how would we know?
[954.32] You must have gotten some 
clue at least.
[960.68] Mr. Idrees? But this woman 
with Mr. Idrees,
[965.04] I am sure this is his second wife.
[967.04] Not just a second wife, 
they even have a son together.
[975.96] It means…
[978.24] wow, Uncle, wow,
[980.12] you turned out be a player.
[986.88] You, what are you thinking?
[990.92] I am surprised by looking at 
so many faces of people.
[994.80] Despite of having Aunt, 
Uncle did second marriage.
[997.88] But it is not wrong to do 
a second marriage.
[1001.60] But it is wrong without informing 
the first wife.
[1005.28] Yes. You are right.
[1008.40] I used to think Mr. Idrees just do
corruption of money
[1011.96] but he is even doing corruption 
in relationships.
[1014.88] That’s how cheaters are.
[1017.20] They are not loyal to money 
or relationships.
[1020.52] You are right.
[1087.16] Dishonest People,
[1094.76] are not just dishonest in terms of money, 
accounts and trade
[1101.76] but they are also dishonest 
with their relationships.
[1109.20] Uncle Idrees is a liar where he works
[1119.92] and also in front of Aunt.
[1124.80] Such people show up to be trustworthy 
in front of the world till they are masked.
[1141.76] Uncle thinks very high if him
[1147.92] but he has no idea
[1153.16] how he will fall from such height.
[1210.96] Yes, what is it?
[1212.88] Listen, Idrees, some girl 
came home today.
[1216.80] Who was that girl?
[1218.88] I don’t know, I didn’t meet her,
[1221.28] your son made her sit 
in the drawing room.
[1224.52] Don’t tell me where did he make 
her sit, tell me who she was?
[1228.96] What did she look like? 
Can you recognize her?
[1231.48] I just told you that 
I didn’t meet her,
[1235.04] it might be some sales girl.
[1238.08] Thank God,
[1239.24] you made me worried on 
such a petty thing.
[1241.84] What is there to be so scared of?
[1245.44] But yes, Idrees,
[1247.08] there is one thing a bit strange,
[1251.64] if she was a sales girl and 
came to sell a product
[1256.68] then how did she leave 
without meeting me?
[1264.24] can it be the same girl 
you told me about?
[1269.84] What is the point of showing off 
your intellect now?
[1274.44] Your cleverness is useless.
[1276.72] If that was Arooj then 
everything is destroyed.
[1279.24] You cannot even do one thing, 
where was the guard at that time?
[1282.36] Idrees, why are you scolding me?
[1284.72] I didn’t ask you to marry me secretly,
[1290.40] I still want everyone to find out.
[1293.24] you don’t understand, you just talk.
[1299.20] Okay I will look into it myself. Bye.
[1312.60] What did I know she will come 
finding it here as well
[1319.52] and a fool like you will even let her 
come inside the house.
[1324.88] Foolish woman,
[1327.76] you got me into trouble.
[1332.48] Arooj.
[1345.20] Idrees is not that scared of Shaista 
as much as he is scared of this girl, Arooj.
[1356.76] Idrees has done second marriage
[1363.20] then why is this girl concerned?
[1370.96] What does she want to find out 
by hiding like this?
[1381.00] Idrees is definitely hiding 
something from me?
[1388.72] What harm can this Arooj do?
[1396.08] It’s something else.
[1407.64] Boss, this…
[1411.96] Boss, is everything well? 
You look unusually worried.
[1416.20] The problem is unusual.
[1420.20] Tell me? I might be able to help.
[1424.44] I think something has gone wrong.
[1427.20] Boss, why are you so scared?
[1431.36] Arooj has gotten to my home.
[1434.08] But you guys live in the same house.
[1437.04] I am talking about my second home.
[1440.08] Is that confirmed?
[1442.48] No, it’s not.
[1445.08] So then shift your second wife 
to somewhere else from there.
[1448.80] And what if someone asks?
[1450.60] You can deny, what is the problem 
in that?
[1454.44] You go away from here right now,
I am already losing my cool,
[1456.52] don’t make me angrier. Go. 
Take whatever you have brought.
[1502.24] But unless you tell us anything, 
how would we know?
[1505.44] You must have gotten some clue 
at least.
[1511.80] Mr. Idrees? But this woman 
with Mr. Idrees,
[1516.12] I am sure this is his second wife.
[1518.08] Not just a second wife, 
they even have a son together.
[1527.00] It means…
[1529.20] wow, Uncle, wow,
[1531.24] you turned out be a player.
[1542.04] What is all this that Uncle has done?
[1552.36] Despite having a good wife like aunt,
second marriage?
[1561.40] Now what should I do about this secret?
[1568.00] Shall I tell all this to aunt Shaista 
and everyone else?
[1588.12] That way I will be accomplished 
in taking my revenge from Uncle
[1598.56] but
[1604.72] there will be a storm in this house,
[1610.24] but I have to save Salman too.
[1616.56] And I will definitely do that.
[1623.04] Arooj, my child, what happened?
[1627.40] Nothing. 
Wait,
[1631.48] I know that you are worried because 
of Ammad’s issue, right?
[1636.40] I told you
[1640.08] that there will come a time when the reason
to roam around with Ammad will be revealed
[1644.76] and Salman won’t have any issue as well,
he will be satisfied.
[1648.28] So my child, when will you 
find the solution?
[1651.04] When you will lose everything?
[1653.20] I have gotten to the results, Aunt,
[1657.04] I have found the solution.
[1659.36] Really, what solution did you find? 
Tell me as well.
[1671.28] I am just helpless due to some reason
due to which
[1678.52] I cannot tell you anything right now.
[1685.52] My child, it looks like you have started 
to hide some things from me now, hmm?
[1691.32] I guess you are forgetting,
[1694.72] You told me
[1697.20] that you blindly trust me,
[1702.08] so then trust your Arooj.
[1753.08] Sister-in-law Arooj is definitely 
hiding something,
[1757.96] now I have even started 
to believe you.
[1762.48] Oh,
[1765.48] so you finally believe me,
[1768.92] how many times I told you this 
but you never believed me
[1772.16] and mom is thinking about 
the separation of Arooj and me.
[1776.88] Separation?
[1779.76] Sorry but I don’t agree 
to Aunt’s decision.
[1785.12] Relationships are supposed 
to be taken care of, dude,
[1788.00] relationships are very sensitive,
[1791.68] you must think 100 times before 
taking a final decision.
[1794.16] And this situation? 
Isn’t this the limit?
[1797.40] My wife who I love so much is 
hanging out with her old friend,
[1801.16] her old University fellow and 
she is confessing it in front of me.
[1805.20] This is something to really worry 
about I can understand.
[1807.48] I am worried,
[1809.24] I am very much worried about this
[1811.44] But dude, Salman,
[1813.92] Sister-in-law Arooj is not that dumb
[1816.44] that she will ruin her happy home.
[1819.88] Would you listen to an advice from me?
[1822.24] Give her some time.
[1826.88] Time?
[1833.08] I am afraid that by giving it more time
there might come a time
[1838.52] when I am unable to defend Arooj
in front of mom.
[1893.36] I told you
[1895.96] that there will come a time when the reason
 to roam around with Ammad will be revealed
[1900.84] and Salman won’t have any issue as well,
he will be satisfied.
[1904.44] So my child, when will you 
find the solution?
[1907.08] When you will lose everything?
[1909.16] I have gotten to the results, Aunt,
[1913.12] I have found the solution.
[1915.36] Really, what solution did you find? 
Tell me as well.
[1921.20] I am just helpless due to some 
reason due to which
[1928.52] I cannot tell you anything right now.
[1938.84] Arooj, why don’t you understand
[1945.16] when the game starts there is also 
a time dedicated to it
[1952.56] and the game needs 
to finish within time,
[1958.88] I agree you are playing very confidently
[1965.88] but you should also know that
 time is going by fast,
[1973.48] getting late in obtaining the result 
can be beneficial for the opposition.
[1984.44] You will have to make a decision 
very soon.
[2003.12] Madam, your juice.
[2006.72] Umm Wasai?
[2009.44] What is going on in Arooj’s mind?
[2014.92] She tells you everything,
[2019.72] so she must have told you, 
tell me what did she say?
[2023.16] No madam,
[2025.88] Madam Jr is tensed
[2031.72] but she didn’t talk about 
anything to me,
[2035.72] yes, but she said
[2039.72] Wasai, pray for me,
[2044.56] I am stuck in some whirlpool
[2049.44] and may God give me the strength 
to take the right decision.
[2055.56] Really?
[2058.16] Okay, you may go.
[2060.56] Okay.
[2093.96] Umm, Boss Madam Musarrat is 
calling you again and again,
[2097.20] you are not attending?
[2100.88] Because of this foolish woman,
[2102.52] the secret that I have been hiding for 
past 10 years, Arooj got hold of it.
[2107.68] Boss, honor is always jeopardized
in such acts,
[2110.56] you have committed such a dangerous
act secretly from Madam Shaista.
[2116.24] You are talking like Musarrat too?
[2119.24] Boss, what do you think,
[2120.52] you should do wrong and 
no one should even say it?
[2122.56] What did you say?
[2123.92] I mean, boss,
[2125.56] now you will know the expenses
of having two wives.
[2129.72] How is that?
[2130.68] Who is bearing the expenses 
for past 10 years?
[2132.40] Madam Arooj wasn’t there earlier,
[2136.00] now all the streams of your corruption 
has dried up,
[2138.92] it’s all just dust now.
[2141.00] Let’s see what happens,
[2143.28] if I am going down, 
I am taking everyone with me.
[2146.92] If there is my name in the list 
of people going down,
[2149.52] do let me know so I can buy 
a cheap life jacket for myself.
[2152.68] Go, get out. Go.
[2154.88] Boss, Madam Nusrat.
[2156.36] I said get lost.
[2201.48] Hello ma’am.
[2203.08] Fatima, come into my room.
[2205.12] Okay ma’am.
[2216.00] Yes.
[2217.04] Yes ma’am?
[2219.00] I have emailed you a file of Stonebury
[2221.36] Okay.
[2222.28] And there is another new project 
I am emailing it to you as well
[2225.12] Okay.
[2226.44] Get the printout of both and make a file
and share it with me.
[2230.32] Okay, ma’am.
