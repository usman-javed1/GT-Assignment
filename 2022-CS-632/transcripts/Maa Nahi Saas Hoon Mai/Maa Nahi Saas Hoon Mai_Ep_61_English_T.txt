[28.32] Madam.
[30.00] Madam.
[32.20] All hell has broken loose madam.
[34.44] What happened? 
What happened?
[37.12] Younger madam has found out
[39.56] that younger sir is not elder madam’s son.
[45.72] She heard you and elder sir talking.
[51.00] What are you saying, Wasai?
[55.48] This is really a torment.
[57.48] Madam,
[58.84] if little madam hadn’t heard this 
with her own ears,
[63.64] then I would have denied it.
[65.60] Now I cannot even deny it.
[68.68] No one found out this secret 
for twenty five years.
[77.56] If this thing is out in the 
open completely,
[81.96] then it will be really bad, Wasai.
[83.92] Madam,
[85.44] you make little madam understand 
that she stays quiet.
[90.56] Yes.
[92.88] But what will I say to Salman?
[96.20] If this secret comes in front of him 
completely?
[101.88] I…
[103.44] I will talk to Arooj.
[106.44] Okay.
[119.28] Now even mama has given orders that
[122.12] Salman is Mehreen’s son.
[127.16] But what will our Salman get?
[134.44] Think a little.
[137.12] Mehreen has lost her memory,
[140.52] we know nothing about Areej,
[142.80] whether she is dead or alive.
[146.24] And Mehreen is considering 
Salman her son.
[152.40] So who does all this belong to?
[155.88] It belongs to your Salman.
[210.52] What is all this?
[218.00] What is all this, after all?
[226.12] I am not the daughter of my parents.
[233.60] Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son.
[239.68] And if,
[244.20] Salman is not aunty’s son, then
[251.80] whose son is he?
[259.40] Did someone also find him 
on the road?
[276.76] And someone put him in the arms 
of a mental patient?
[291.88] Are me and Salman suffering 
from the same sorrow?
[343.68] Younger madam has found out
[346.12] that younger sir is not elder madam’s son.
[352.28] She heard you and elder sir talking.
[357.56] What are you saying, Wasai?
[362.16] This is really a torment.
[364.16] Madam,
[365.48] if little madam hadn’t heard this 
with her own ears,
[370.24] then I would have denied it.
[372.12] Now I cannot even deny it.
[376.60] The tables will be turned on the game
[383.56] that I have made for Salman.
[389.32] If Mehreen finds out this, 
then all hell will break loose.
[403.28] What happened Shahista? 
What are you thinking about?
[409.64] It is something worrisome.
[412.64] Is all okay? What happened?
[415.16] Everything is okay till now,
[417.80] but it will not remain okay for long.
[420.00] Hey, tell me, what happened?
[425.92] Arooj heard all that 
we were talking about.
[431.44] I used to tell you not to talk about this
again and again for this day.
[436.12] This is not the time to get 
angry with me.
[438.88] Right now, tell me, 
what do we have to do?
[441.16] What trouble have you put me in.
[447.44] Arooj shouldn’t find out any further
[449.84] and she will have to stay quiet 
for what this is and why this is.
[454.28] If she insists on knowing?
[456.56] Keep avoiding it, no matter what.
[460.00] and if she asks Salman, then?
[462.04] You will ensure that you restrict 
Arooj from talking to Salman.
[465.92] No matter what happens.
[495.76] She is comparing my love and 
her love making Salman stand in a court.
[508.40] You think yourself, aunt.
[512.20] How difficult will all this be for a son?
[518.32] and mothers happily put their sons 
in this difficulty daily.
[571.28] So you have found out.
[576.80] This is true, Arooj, child.
[588.40] If Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son,
[593.16] then whose son is he?
[623.96] We have a relative,
[631.04] Salman is their child.
[639.92] So,
[643.60] does Salman know this?
[651.24] He doesn’t know
[654.96] and neither does Mehreen know.
[661.52] If Mehreen finds out this truth,
[667.44] then she will not be able to 
tolerate this mental trauma,
[673.48] and if Salman finds out about this,
[680.08] then his personality will be ruined.
[688.56] I don’t understand. I mean,
[697.72] the whole home is acting of lying 
including Wasai.
[704.00] and I want that you support us too.
[715.12] And stay quiet.
[717.08] You will not tell anyone this truth.
[720.72] Can you do that for me?
[768.84] Arooj please.
[838.68] God, have mercy.
[843.68] All will break loose in this home,
[847.08] there will be an earthquake.
[850.52] She will never accept that 
he is not her son.
[858.68] Who, Wasai?
[861.32] Who is not whose son?
[863.76] I…
[865.60] I was talking about my son.
[869.48] I have no son.
[873.00] If I had a son,
[874.96] then I wouldn’t have had to work 
so hard in this age.
[879.12] Hmmm.
[881.20] You know Wasai,
[883.48] lucky mothers like me have sons.
Right?
[889.72] Yes. Yes.
[890.96] You are absolutely right.
[895.80] You start your work.
[898.56] Sure.
[1016.80] So you have found out.
[1022.36] This is the truth, Arooj, child.
[1028.60] If Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son,
[1033.40] then whose son is he?
[1036.36] We have a relative,
[1043.20] Salman is their child.
[1052.40] So,
[1055.84] does Salman know this?
[1063.44] He doesn’t know
[1067.12] and neither does Mehreen know.
[1073.68] If Mehreen finds out this truth,
[1079.84] then she will not be able to tolerate 
this mental trauma,
[1096.24] the whole home is acting of lying 
including Wasai.
[1102.56] and I want that you support us too.
[1113.56] And stay quiet.
[1115.56] You will not tell anyone this truth.
[1119.24] Can you do that for me?
[1129.00] What accident happened with 
aunt Mehreen,
[1137.32] that she...
[1142.88] started considering Salman 
her son mentally.
[1151.96] This means
[1157.64] aunt Mehreen is not in her 
correct mental state.
[1171.32] And by the time she comes 
to her right mental state,
[1180.16] she will not remain Salman’s mama.
[1189.00] But…
[1193.56] but aunt Mehreen will get 
fine someday.
[1203.48] And this can happen at any day.
[1221.92] What is this
[1226.40] that me and Salman live with mothers
[1236.32] who are not our own.
[1247.92] But my sorrow is much bigger 
than Salman’s.
[1260.00] We know about Salman’s real parents,
[1271.08] but who are my parents?
[1280.48] No one knows this.
[1391.28] Who told you Salman?
[1393.36] My friend’s father told me.
[1399.44] He told me there is a family who lost their
daughter twenty four to twenty five years ago.
[1404.84] I feel you can be that child.
[1407.64] And?
[1408.88] And what did they tell you? 
Tell me.
[1414.12] Where was she born? 
Who are those people?
[1416.48] What was her name?
[1417.96] He must have told you 
anything more.
[1422.52] I don’t know about this.
[1424.92] We can find out when 
we meet them.
[1427.16] Yes, so when will we meet them?
[1429.28] We are going to meet them 
tomorrow morning.
[1432.60] Morning?
[1437.52] We will meet them tomorrow morning?
[1444.20] Why in the morning?
[1445.92] Why can we not meet them right now?
[1455.16] When will it be morning?
[1494.80] Are you going to the office?
[1500.56] And where is Arooj going?
[1515.52] Yes, I had to go something out of city,
so I thought I would pick Arooj too.
[1522.40] She will also have an outing.
[1526.92] Okay.
[1528.88] So I too will come along 
with you people.
[1531.60] I also haven’t gone out for long.
[1541.88] Mehreen, you surprise me.
[1544.16] We are not in the age that 
we go for an outing.
[1546.52] The kids are of the age,
 let them go.
[1549.64] But sister in law Shaista, I..
[1552.36] Mehreen, please.
[1554.20] You children go, 
Go and enjoy.
[1557.84] Bye.
[1558.84] Bye. 
Bye.
[1609.24] Madam.
[1611.56] Yes?
[1613.00] You have sent little madam
and little master,
[1618.32] but a big scene will be created 
with them gone.
[1628.48] Elder madam is really angry.
[1633.84] Hey, when is she not angry?
[1637.48] So tell me, what were she saying now?
[1641.28] She was saying let younger madam come,
[1645.72] then I will teach her a lesson.
[1652.76] This woman will not let anyone 
live in this home.
[1657.12] Anyway, when Arooj comes, 
you will tell me first.
[1660.72] I will handle the entire matter.
[1662.76] Yes, madam, as you order.
[1684.40] Now my patience is running out.
[1688.20] Then go. Go and tell him.
[1693.16] Think, when Salman will find out 
you are his real mother,
[1696.76] how much will he hate you.
[1702.08] That in childhood you put her 
in Mehreen’s arms, for money.
[1709.88] Not for the sake of money,
[1712.80] for the sake of Mehreen’s life.
[1722.00] Fool everyone,
[1724.48] but don’t fool me and yourself, 
Shaista.
[1741.44] Salman,
[1742.76] you are already really late 
for the office.
[1744.88] I think you should go now.
[1747.28] Goodbye.
[1748.96] Arooj. 
Yes.
[1756.96] I am really sorry.
[1762.60] My information turned out to be wrong
[1766.00] and that family was not your family.
[1769.84] And your hope broke.
[1773.28] What are you saying?
[1776.76] You tried, you supported me,
[1781.52] rest is up to my fate.
[1783.56] I am really hopeful that
[1786.44] you will find your family soon.
[1792.92] I will go now.
[1797.36] Take care of yourself.
[1802.00] Listen.
[1806.40] Thank you,
[1808.80] for trying so much for me.
[1849.76] Salman is searching for my family 
in my love.
[1863.12] He doesn’t know that
[1869.48] he himself lives in the home 
of a stranger.
[1878.68] Those parents must be so cruel
[1887.68] who put the life of their own son
[1895.44] to save someone’s life.
[1905.00] Even after knowing everything,
[1911.20] they put him in aunt Mehreen’s arms.
[1940.32] Stop.
[1948.12] Where are you coming from?
[1951.56] I had told you in the morning.
[1953.36] So?
[1954.68] Will tell me again break hell loose?
[1957.32] Where are taking my son 
in the name of outing?
[1965.72] My son is stuck in weird problems.
[1968.60] You lied and took him to
your parent’s home.
[1976.88] Aunty, I am already really worried. 
I will talk to you later.
[1980.08] Keep your worry to yourself, 
why are you worrying my son?
[1991.76] The worries of me and 
Salman are not different.
[1994.88] I don’t care about your worries,
I only worry for my son.
[1999.00] Where did you leave my son? Huh?
[2001.04] My son is stuck in a weird problem.
[2007.92] My son. My son. My son.
[2011.36] Why are you saying this 
again and again?
[2013.52] Have you lost your mind?
[2027.04] Salman is not your son.
[2030.68] He is not your son.
[2144.20] Idrees, where are you?
[2147.16] Come home immediately.
[2150.36] What could happen?
[2151.96] The same drama of Mehreen.
[2155.88] The doctor is here to check up on her.
[2157.92] Salman is showing her.
[2161.60] You reach home, I will tell you.
[2165.08] Okay.
[2216.12] Arooj.
[2219.36] What did you do?
[2223.28] I didn’t expect you to be this stupid.
[2229.08] How many times had I told you 
not to mention this in front of Mehreen,
[2232.76] that Salman is not her son.
[2235.88] Aunt, I was angry, I said it.
[2238.48] You didn’t have to say it.
[2240.44] So what do I do, aunt?
[2246.24] A person is coming from outside.
What mood are they in?
[2248.80] At times the mood is good 
at times not.
[2253.28] She always talks to me 
in the same tone.
[2257.88] Can a person lose their patience
 for once, or not?
[2262.80] You are right child.
[2265.72] I know you are good.
[2267.84] In fact, you are very good.
[2271.24] We have been trying Mehreen 
for years,
[2275.56] expecting good from her 
is out stupidity.
[2280.72] But…
[2281.40] The issue is of this but.
[2284.36] Even you know what is correct.
[2289.60] But still, no one is willing to say 
aunt Mehreen is wrong.
[2293.56] You tried speaking the truth,
[2296.36] was Mehreen able to tolerate it?
[2301.36] Have no relation with your relations 
is a heavy truth.
[2316.00] You are right, child.
[2322.80] I cannot Salman my own, 
even after he is mine.
