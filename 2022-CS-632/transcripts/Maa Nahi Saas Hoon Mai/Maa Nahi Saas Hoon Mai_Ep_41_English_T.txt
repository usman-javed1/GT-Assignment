[34.52] He quit the job for my sake.
[37.60] He saved my home.
[39.96] There is nothing like that.
[43.64] You are mistaken.
[47.16] He was a really smart man.
[49.68] He knew he would get 
caught that is why
[52.64] he left himself.
[84.28] After all you really sympathize 
with him a lot.
[86.24] I can see it.
[89.72] I sympathize with his sick mother,
[96.44] who is a cancer patient.
[107.44] Actually, not everything 
is business.
[110.68] Some things are ahead 
of basic counting.
[118.20] If you want, I can help him.
[125.16] His mother will get treated.
[131.16] You will help him?
[134.52] Kindly clear his dues soon.
[138.12] The poor thing needs money.
[141.56] A cheque for five 
hundred thousand,
[143.28] for your mother’s treatment.
[144.88] I am so sorry, I cannot take this,
[148.16] and yes,
[149.16] your claim to recognize
 people is not correct.
[191.08] Son, Ammad.
[192.76] Yes?
[194.44] Can I ask you something?
[196.08] Mama, listen to me.
[198.00] You are not well, so
[199.92] don’t talk, okay?
[204.12] Son, I know
[206.12] when you don’t want to answer me,
[209.52] you do this.
[211.32] Okay, I am so, sorry.
[213.12] Tell me, what is the matter?
[216.00] Son, why did you quit the job?
[218.60] Mama, had I not quit the job,
[224.28] then Mr. Salman would have left Arooj.
[228.20] What happened Ammad?
[233.12] Leave it, mama.
[234.96] Just think that whatever 
decision your son made,
[237.20] he did after thinking hard.
[240.96] But son, you are worried.
[245.20] No. Not at all.
[253.48] How will you get me treated, son?
[256.84] God used to get it done earlier,
[258.60] He will do it even now.
[262.60] You rest, lie down. Come on.
[265.36] Lie down.
[298.80] Little madam,
[301.64] come for breakfast.
[306.36] Elder madam is really angry.
[312.20] Anyway, she is always angry.
[322.00] You go ahead, I will come.
[332.80] I told you,
[334.84] you go ahead, I am coming.
[337.80] Okay.
[357.00] Hello.
[358.72] What happened Shanzay? 
All okay?
[360.16] You are calling so 
early in the morning?
[361.52] I am really worried, Arooj.
[363.96] What happened? All okay?
[365.28] Are you fine?
[366.48] I am fine, but Ammad is not.
[370.96] Why? What happened to him?
[373.76] His mama is unwell.
[379.48] That’s why I get upset with him.
[383.12] I was taking a stand for him,
[385.72] and he left the game himself.
[388.88] Leave all this.
[390.84] I just know that Ammad 
has no money at all,
[394.16] and his mother is a cancer patient.
[396.20] And you know well how much is
 the regular expense of a cancer patient.
[401.56] Yes.
[404.08] I will have to do something.
[407.76] Can you do something, Shanzay?
[410.40] You force him to meet me once.
[414.08] At least he should meet me.
[415.96] Because if I ask him,
[417.56] then he will not listen to me at all.
[420.64] Yes, I can ask him
[423.52] but let’s see what happens then.
[426.64] Okay fine, we will see 
what can be done.
[434.36] I will call you, okay? Goodbye.
[437.44] Okay, goodbye.
[457.76] Hello. Hello, Ammad.
[530.28] Shall we have breakfast?
[531.36] Huh?
[534.76] Yes, I am waiting for mom.
[565.60] What is the matter?
[567.84] Why is the environment in
home like that of a mourning?
[572.76] Is someone dead?
[584.28] I am addressing you, Arooj?
[588.84] Yes, aunty.
[590.08] If I have said you,
[593.00] then this means, 
I am addressing you.
[602.60] Why do you have such 
a sad face like that?
[608.28] Did you two have an argument?
[620.84] No aunty, I am not well.
[628.76] Why?
[630.48] What happened to you?
[634.32] Nothing.
[636.12] She is a weird girl.
[638.88] She changes her statements 
within moments.
[641.40] It is your courage, Salman,
[642.72] that you tolerate this Arooj.
[654.28] No action of hers is right.
[671.24] Come on, let’s have breakfast.
[677.52] Wasai, have breakfast served.
[685.08] Arooj,
[688.36] won’t you have breakfast?
[693.96] My breakfast is done.
[702.52] My stomach is full.
[738.72] Look,
[739.80] if you have called me here,
 to help me,
[742.88] then my answer is clear.
[746.48] I have called you for help,
 but for my help.
[750.96] And yes,
[751.48] I don’t believe in breaking
 the rules of friends.
[755.56] That’s good,
[757.08] then tell me, how can
 I be of help for you?
[760.20] I will tell you.
[761.36] But I tell you on one condition.
[763.32] You will have to accept
 whatever I say.
[764.64] You will not ask any questions.
[766.60] Come on, man, don’t bother 
me with these conditions,
[769.20] just tell me clearly 
what do I have to do?
[773.00] Actually, the thing is Ammad, that
[776.32] I have made an entire
 plan to reveal uncle.
[781.80] I am just not able to execute that plan.
[784.40] Oh, you want that
 I rejoin the office?
[788.60] Huh?
[789.64] No,
[790.20] I don’t want that you join 
the office again.
[793.32] Then?
[795.04] I just want that
[797.84] you can help me in revealing uncle.
[801.32] Okay.
[803.04] Maybe you don’t know
[805.36] a lot of negatives are being 
said for you and me
[810.92] and they are reaching Salman.
[814.20] I know Salman is not like this at all,
[818.56] but now I feel that
[820.36] I will have to do something.
[823.24] And by the way,
[824.36] I will pay you to do all this,
[826.64] as my case consultant. Is that okay?
[830.24] Okay.
[832.00] Fine, I will do one thing,
[834.92] I will take you to such a home,
[836.92] where marble worth sixty-five 
hundred thousand has been laid,
[839.52] that too by your uncle.
[884.96] That’s the home.
[891.00] Greetings.
[891.76] Greetings.
[892.64] If someone lives inside,
[894.40] then can we meet them?
[895.64] Sir is not at home.
[897.76] Man, whenever I come,
[898.88] you say the same thing,
[899.60] that sir is not at home.
[900.72] When sir in not there,
[901.84] then where do I bring him for you?
[903.72] Look, if anyone is present at home,
[905.64] then I will go inside and meet them.
[907.28] Madam, no one is inside.
[909.36] Only sir lives here, who is not there.
[913.48] And I cannot let you go inside.
[919.92] Now what do we do, tell me?
[921.64] This is the home.
[987.36] These two will not stop.
[991.92] Finally, they reached there.
[1017.04] Son, Salman,
[1019.20] Arooj is deceiving all of us.
[1020.68] Look at this.
[1022.32] Ammad did a drama of 
quitting the job,
[1024.00] although they are meeting 
all around the city.
[1030.72] When is this picture from?
[1033.72] Right now. Recent.
[1039.20] Yes, but uncle,
[1040.32] it is possible that
[1041.36] this picture is from the time
 when Ammad was in our company.
[1044.28] Look carefully.
[1045.20] Look, see the date on it. See.
[1067.56] Yes, date…
[1070.68] It is today’s date.
[1071.80] This means those people 
are still in contact.
[1074.44] He has only quit the office.
[1082.92] From where is this picture from?
[1084.12] Huh?
[1086.12] Where is it from?
[1087.52] What difference does it make?
[1088.80] What importance does this thing have?
[1089.52] There is importance.
[1091.32] There is a lot of importance,
[1093.32] so that Arooj can be asked
[1095.04] what she was doing with 
Ammad at this place.
[1097.36] In this matter, where doesn’t matter, 
why matter.
[1100.28] Why are they together?
[1101.88] I don’t understand anything.
[1103.24] I understand everything.
[1105.12] Ammad and Arooj are planning
 against the company together,
[1107.84] so that they can ruin this company.
[1112.16] In my eyes my life matters 
more than this company,
[1116.64] and I will not let it get ruined.
[1130.24] I think the arrow has 
hit the bullseye.
[1190.40] Salman said something
 really meaningful
[1195.32] that my life is more
 important than this life.
[1198.60] The business is going well.
[1202.12] Yes, there is a problem 
in his life.
[1206.56] This means that Salman 
will fix his life,
[1212.80] so he will reach the real 
character of this story
[1215.60] who has disturbed his life.
[1220.56] Then Salman will throw out that
[1222.68] disliked character from his 
life story and this way,
[1225.76] we will have a happy ending.
[1228.52] Amazing.
[1229.72] Idrees, you have great brains.
[1234.76] Did you notice something, 
Ammad?
[1237.08] What is that?
[1238.64] That guard was a little weird.
[1241.20] He didn’t talk to us properly,
[1243.12] neither did he let us 
go inside the home.
[1246.12] Obviously, when we don’t 
know who lives here,
[1250.20] then why would he 
let us go inside?
[1251.68] And why would he 
have told us?
[1253.64] Yes, but we should 
know who lives there.
[1258.16] What will that do?
[1259.76] We will find out who 
received the marble.
[1265.04] Who received the marble
 is not our problem.
[1268.80] We need to find out
[1270.40] who the marble bas
 been sold to.
[1274.00] Look,
[1274.76] if you want
[1275.96] that we find out
[1277.56] who received the marble there,
[1280.24] we can also find out 
from the company too,
[1283.08] they will give us all the
 information easily.
[1286.36] Yes, you are right.
[1287.28] We will find out about that.
[1289.20] Look finding out the information...
[1290.64] ... is something that will 
only take a minute.
[1291.52] But in actual
[1293.20] you don’t want to
 expose your uncle.
[1297.44] Right now, I don’t want 
to expose anyone.
[1301.92] I have to look at the finance,
[1303.76] identify the loopholes
[1306.20] and make this system secure.
[1309.92] Okay
[1318.84] Sir you act really smart,
[1321.12] what is this wrong thing 
that you did.
[1323.68] What wrong did I do?
[1325.44] What was the need for you to 
show the picture to Mr. Salman?
[1329.60] What else could I do?
[1330.88] Arooj is tightening 
the screws around us.
[1333.80] Not around us, sir,
[1335.20] around you. You forget.
[1338.08] If something happens to me then
[1339.24] you too will be part of it.
 Don’t forget.
[1343.36] I will become a witness on
 the promise of forgiveness.
[1346.64] You are disloyal.
[1348.20] You bite the hand that feeds you.
[1350.36] This idiom doesn’t sound
 good coming from you.
[1352.64] Okay, don’t talk so much.
[1355.92] If Mr. Salman finds out 
where this picture is from,
[1359.44] then what will you do?
[1362.04] I am not thinking till that far.
[1364.64] Why is that?
[1366.88] Things will not reach that point.
[1368.48] The ones who conspire against 
us will get ruined before that.
[1371.96] Think good things.
[1373.64] Do bad and think good,
[1375.76] how will I do that, boss?
[1376.72] Nawaz, I am already worried,
[1378.80] don’t worry me more.
[1381.60] Boss, the worry will be where you
 have thrown the spark of argument.
[1387.60] Mr. Salman must have reached 
home from the office.
[1393.44] If our plan is successful,
[1396.52] then we will have 
a solution to all our problems.
[1401.16] Understand?
[1460.88] The reality is that she is not
 bad character at all.
[1463.28] You are mistaken.
[1464.80] Fine,
[1466.00] I will give you this much 
concession that
[1467.72] when you liked that Arooj,
[1469.80] chosen her for marriage,
[1471.08] back then she was naïve,
[1473.68] but since that boy Ammad
[1477.88] has come here in the office,
[1480.04] since then Arooj has changed.
[1503.12] What has my life become?
[1507.16] One worry doesn’t end,
[1510.28] another start
[1530.28] Salman,
[1535.88] are you thinking of something?
[1539.68] No, mama.
[1542.60] You look worried to me.
[1547.36] There is nothing like that.
[1553.08] You are hiding it from me.
[1557.48] There is nothing mama.
[1563.40] I am just caught up in an issue.
[1568.20] You just have one issue,
[1571.08] and that is Arooj.
[1579.24] Your silence tells me
[1582.32] what I am saying is true.
[1583.88] Please mama,
[1588.56] stop it.
[1593.24] I know the issue,
[1596.00] you tell me what do you want?
[1600.40] Every person wants the 
solution to their problem.
[1604.28] You want a solution 
to your problem...
[1606.88] ... in Arooj’s presence, 
in front of her?
[1617.72] Mom, I am already really disturbed.
[1620.80] Don’t disturb me more.
[1689.12] Salman, what is the matter?
 What happened to you?
[1698.36] We had married out of love, right?
[1705.32] Answer me.
[1707.88] That’s how it was, right?
[1711.64] Yes, that’s how it was.
[1714.28] Wrong!
[1717.40] Absolutely wrong!
[1722.20] I…
[1725.28] I married you out of love.
[1732.36] You didn’t.
[1735.00] What is wrong with you Salman?
[1737.16] What are you saying?
[1738.56] I am speaking the truth.
[1741.04] and what is the truth?
[1743.08] The truth is you didn’t 
want to marry me.
[1746.32] I married you forcefully 
against your will.
[1752.04] Look,
[1753.04] you are saying the wrong thing.
[1755.00] Arooj.
[1757.20] Arooj you are forgetting
[1760.28] you didn’t want to marry me.
[1763.00] You became helpless out of
 my insistence or else…
[1770.28] Not helplessness,
[1773.12] I confessed my love to you.
[1777.24] I married you out of love,
[1779.00] Salman and I am really 
happy with this marriage.
[1785.48] You are wrong again.
[1788.40] You are not happy with me.
[1791.60] How do I make you believe
[1793.80] that I am really happy with you…
[1795.12] Then why don’t you I see all this?
[1798.04] Why do I see something else?
[1803.12] I am surprised.
[1806.00] What is there,
[1808.44] you don’t see it,
[1811.16] and that which is not there,
[1812.44] the thing that doesn’t exist,
[1814.88] you see it.
[1821.88] Really?
[1837.44] What is this?
[1875.20] Idrees Brother ! Greetings.
[1876.96] Greetings.
[1877.92] I was coming to you,
[1880.08] I had to talk about
 something important.
[1881.64] Go ahead, Mehreen.
[1882.68] Brother Idrees,
[1884.92] I am really worried cause
 of Salman.
[1887.84] I don’t know what is Salman
[1889.36] so worried about nowadays.
[1895.68] That’s how it is. 
Salman is worried.
[1898.20] You must know the real 
reason for it, right?
[1901.48] No, Salman would know the reason.
[1904.76] He is not telling me anything.
[1906.52] I just asked him, he said it is nothing.
[1908.76] God knows what his worry his.
[1911.76] But I am sure Mehreen,
[1913.16] only Arooj will be the 
reason for his worry.
[1916.12] Even I know this,
[1918.16] but Salman should also say this.
[1920.84] How can he say it? 
He will be embarrassed.
[1923.36] Embarrassed about what?
[1924.96] Mehreen, you know he 
married Arooj out of her love,
[1927.52] that too against your liking.
[1930.52] So, then?
[1931.72] So how can he bad mouth Arooj,
[1933.24] that too in front of you?
[1935.72] Meaning, what Salman
 is not able to tell me,
[1937.60] the real reason for that 
is this embarrassment.
[1942.72] He cannot call Arooj 
wrong in front of anyone,
[1944.68] even though she is wrong.
[1947.44] You people are really 
weird brother Idrees.
[1950.04] At the time of the wedding,
[1951.16] you husband and wife became one
[1952.92] and you left me alone for this Arooj.
[1958.64] You are right, that was our mistake.
[1963.32] But if you want then
[1965.04] we can make amends for it.
[1967.68] Amends? But how?
[1973.36] By throwing out this issue 
from Salman’s life forever.
[2017.84] Your silence tells me
[2021.40] that you don’t have
 the words to justify this.
[2028.96] Since I have come to this home,
[2032.64] I have only been giving justifications.
[2035.08] Arooj,
[2038.24] don’t try to change the topic.
[2041.20] Tell me what I have asked.
[2044.08] What is this?
[2047.96] This picture is absolutely correct.
[2061.72] Ammad and I are there in it.
[2070.84] Do you even know 
what you are saying?
[2074.52] Yes.
[2078.52] I know well what I am saying.
[2088.16] And you have no 
embarrassment on this?
[2092.24] I ask you why is he with you? Tell me.
[2099.20] You had told me to fire 
him from the company.
[2104.40] I did that.
[2111.24] Now this in no way means
[2116.68] that I cannot even 
meet my friend.
[2120.52] What is your relation with him?
[2122.84] Tell me.
[2132.08] Friendship.
[2137.08] Loyalty.
[2141.88] Loyalty or…
[2143.16] Enough Salman.
[2145.20] That’s enough.
[2149.76] Because now if you 
say something,
[2152.48] then we will have nothing 
left to speak in between us.
[2195.00] What will you say seeing all 
that has happened?
[2199.76] Be calm Salman,
[2202.48] the matter won’t
 be as you see it.
[2207.00] Aunt you are taking this 
situation really light.
[2210.72] Yes,
[2211.84] we will have to do it.
[2214.40] But you had said 
this to me earlier too,
[2219.00] that I should be
 lenient towards Arooj.
[2223.28] But you were not
 lenient towards her.
[2229.04] Look, I tried a lot,
[2231.48] I made her understand a lot, 
but it had no benefit.
[2236.72] Now you tell me, 
what should I do?
