If you keep on thinking like this, you will die of starving one day. Umm, I think so, the rest is up to you. Arooj, look your situation has quite… I mean our situation has gone 
quite bad, you have to do something else I will leave this city. What do you mean? You will leave me alone once again? Yes, because all of this is happening 
because of him, if you wouldn’t have helped 
Arooj this much, brother Salman wouldn’t have had 
this doubt in his heart at all. Look, you just shut up, we are talking about a serious 
thing here. So you think I am nonserious? Whatever the problem is going on here, 
I am taking it seriously. If that’s the case then find a solution
to this problem. Yes, yes, definitely, why not? Arooj, you tell me, what should be done? Ammad, I have collected all the proofs 
against Uncle but the people whose names 
are connected with him, they are huge businessmen, they are renowned in the market, they have big companies and Salman’s company also 
has a reputation. Yes, they all will be defamed like this 
and no company would want that. Exactly, that is why we also need witnesses 
along with the proofs. And the companies that are involved 
in this matter will never give statements. Okay let’s suppose, even if we force someone 
and bring them and they even give a statement 
against Uncle, then? You know what will happen then? Neither Salman will do business 
with them, nor Uncle will do business with Salman. Hey, why are you guys going 
around in circles? We just need one witness, you guys were telling me about that 
house where that marble was sold, people who live there are not 
from the market, they would be a family,
take statement from them. I think, good idea but we don’t know the people 
who live there, we have just met the gatekeeper there
and he is very rude and he will never let us go inside. We will go inside the bungalow and all the secrets will be out. You guys are such fools, both of you know it very well 
when Shanzey is done having lunch, her brain starts functioning efficiently. Hmm, I can see how efficient 
madam’s brain is functioning. Very funny. Dude, you guys don’t watch films. 
Okay listen, I have a plan. Shaista, you just get stuck
 on one thing. You are the one who is stuck 
on ruining Salman’s life, forgetting the fact that 
Salman is our son, we have just given him to Mehreen 
to save her life. I haven’t forgotten anything, 
how can someone forget their son? Tell me. Idrees, promise me one thing. What promise? 
Okay I do, I will accept whatever you say, 
tell me, what is it? Idrees, promise me that you will never interfere
 in Salman and Arooj’s matter ever again. Salman is our son, Arooj is our daughter-in-law. Looking at the intensity of 
Salman’s love for Arooj, I am scared that just because of the fire lit 
by you and Mehreen, he might harm himself. Okay promise, I accept 
what you are saying. Hang up. Thank you. Take care. I had someone very close to my heart, I am breaking for her. I know, I know who you are speaking about. I left the whole world and chose her, I went against my mother for her. And what did she do? What did Arooj do? Disloyalty. We have to wait here. Arooj cannot come until 
the guard leaves. Call Arooj. Yes. yes, Arooj, don’t come right now, 
the guard is sitting here. okay I will let you know. dude, when will he leave? Why isn't he leaving? Hello? Yes, madam, yes, okay madam, I am just coming 
in 2 minutes. Call Arooj, quickly.
Yes. Quickly, quickly, quickly. Hello? Arooj? Arooj, The guard is leaving, 
come quickly. Immediately. Okay. Where is this Arooj? Best of luck. Greetings. 
Greetings. Is your mom home? 
Yes. May I come in and meet her. 
Yes, come in. You go sit inside, I will just 
call mom right now. Okay. Oh! So the stolen marble and tiles 
have been used here. Wow. Someone has made such a 
royal bungalow with stolen items. Uncle? It means that Uncle has secretly done 
another marriage. What did I come here for and a new Pandora's box opened here. I think I should leave. Who has come, son? There is no one here. An Aunt came here. If she came, where did she go then? You go and call the Guard, how did he let anyone in? You sent him to get the groceries. Wait a minute, who are you? 
And how did you go inside? Listen to me, who are you? How did you go inside? Wait, brother who are you? I am asking you to stop, 
who are you? Stop. Who were these people? 
And how did they go inside? If boss finds out he will kill me and even fire me from work. Arooj, at least tell something, 
what happened after all? I feel she hasn’t been very successful. But unless you tell us anything,
how would we know? You must have gotten some 
clue at least. Mr. Idrees? But this woman 
with Mr. Idrees, I am sure this is his second wife. Not just a second wife, 
they even have a son together. It means… wow, Uncle, wow, you turned out be a player. You, what are you thinking? I am surprised by looking at 
so many faces of people. Despite of having Aunt, 
Uncle did second marriage. But it is not wrong to do 
a second marriage. But it is wrong without informing 
the first wife. Yes. You are right. I used to think Mr. Idrees just do
corruption of money but he is even doing corruption 
in relationships. That’s how cheaters are. They are not loyal to money 
or relationships. You are right. Dishonest People, are not just dishonest in terms of money, 
accounts and trade but they are also dishonest 
with their relationships. Uncle Idrees is a liar where he works and also in front of Aunt. Such people show up to be trustworthy 
in front of the world till they are masked. Uncle thinks very high if him but he has no idea how he will fall from such height. Yes, what is it? Listen, Idrees, some girl 
came home today. Who was that girl? I don’t know, I didn’t meet her, your son made her sit 
in the drawing room. Don’t tell me where did he make 
her sit, tell me who she was? What did she look like? 
Can you recognize her? I just told you that 
I didn’t meet her, it might be some sales girl. Thank God, you made me worried on 
such a petty thing. What is there to be so scared of? But yes, Idrees, there is one thing a bit strange, if she was a sales girl and 
came to sell a product then how did she leave 
without meeting me? can it be the same girl 
you told me about? What is the point of showing off 
your intellect now? Your cleverness is useless. If that was Arooj then 
everything is destroyed. You cannot even do one thing, 
where was the guard at that time? Idrees, why are you scolding me? I didn’t ask you to marry me secretly, I still want everyone to find out. you don’t understand, you just talk. Okay I will look into it myself. Bye. What did I know she will come 
finding it here as well and a fool like you will even let her 
come inside the house. Foolish woman, you got me into trouble. Arooj. Idrees is not that scared of Shaista 
as much as he is scared of this girl, Arooj. Idrees has done second marriage then why is this girl concerned? What does she want to find out 
by hiding like this? Idrees is definitely hiding 
something from me? What harm can this Arooj do? It’s something else. Boss, this… Boss, is everything well? 
You look unusually worried. The problem is unusual. Tell me? I might be able to help. I think something has gone wrong. Boss, why are you so scared? Arooj has gotten to my home. But you guys live in the same house. I am talking about my second home. Is that confirmed? No, it’s not. So then shift your second wife 
to somewhere else from there. And what if someone asks? You can deny, what is the problem 
in that? You go away from here right now,
I am already losing my cool, don’t make me angrier. Go. 
Take whatever you have brought. But unless you tell us anything, 
how would we know? You must have gotten some clue 
at least. Mr. Idrees? But this woman 
with Mr. Idrees, I am sure this is his second wife. Not just a second wife, 
they even have a son together. It means… wow, Uncle, wow, you turned out be a player. What is all this that Uncle has done? Despite having a good wife like aunt,
second marriage? Now what should I do about this secret? Shall I tell all this to aunt Shaista 
and everyone else? That way I will be accomplished 
in taking my revenge from Uncle but there will be a storm in this house, but I have to save Salman too. And I will definitely do that. Arooj, my child, what happened? Nothing. 
Wait, I know that you are worried because 
of Ammad’s issue, right? I told you that there will come a time when the reason
to roam around with Ammad will be revealed and Salman won’t have any issue as well,
he will be satisfied. So my child, when will you 
find the solution? When you will lose everything? I have gotten to the results, Aunt, I have found the solution. Really, what solution did you find? 
Tell me as well. I am just helpless due to some reason
due to which I cannot tell you anything right now. My child, it looks like you have started 
to hide some things from me now, hmm? I guess you are forgetting, You told me that you blindly trust me, so then trust your Arooj. Sister-in-law Arooj is definitely 
hiding something, now I have even started 
to believe you. Oh, so you finally believe me, how many times I told you this 
but you never believed me and mom is thinking about 
the separation of Arooj and me. Separation? Sorry but I don’t agree 
to Aunt’s decision. Relationships are supposed 
to be taken care of, dude, relationships are very sensitive, you must think 100 times before 
taking a final decision. And this situation? 
Isn’t this the limit? My wife who I love so much is 
hanging out with her old friend, her old University fellow and 
she is confessing it in front of me. This is something to really worry 
about I can understand. I am worried, I am very much worried about this But dude, Salman, Sister-in-law Arooj is not that dumb that she will ruin her happy home. Would you listen to an advice from me? Give her some time. Time? I am afraid that by giving it more time
there might come a time when I am unable to defend Arooj
in front of mom. I told you that there will come a time when the reason
 to roam around with Ammad will be revealed and Salman won’t have any issue as well,
he will be satisfied. So my child, when will you 
find the solution? When you will lose everything? I have gotten to the results, Aunt, I have found the solution. Really, what solution did you find? 
Tell me as well. I am just helpless due to some 
reason due to which I cannot tell you anything right now. Arooj, why don’t you understand when the game starts there is also 
a time dedicated to it and the game needs 
to finish within time, I agree you are playing very confidently but you should also know that
 time is going by fast, getting late in obtaining the result 
can be beneficial for the opposition. You will have to make a decision 
very soon. Madam, your juice. Umm Wasai? What is going on in Arooj’s mind? She tells you everything, so she must have told you, 
tell me what did she say? No madam, Madam Jr is tensed but she didn’t talk about 
anything to me, yes, but she said Wasai, pray for me, I am stuck in some whirlpool and may God give me the strength 
to take the right decision. Really? Okay, you may go. Okay. Umm, Boss Madam Musarrat is 
calling you again and again, you are not attending? Because of this foolish woman, the secret that I have been hiding for 
past 10 years, Arooj got hold of it. Boss, honor is always jeopardized
in such acts, you have committed such a dangerous
act secretly from Madam Shaista. You are talking like Musarrat too? Boss, what do you think, you should do wrong and 
no one should even say it? What did you say? I mean, boss, now you will know the expenses
of having two wives. How is that? Who is bearing the expenses 
for past 10 years? Madam Arooj wasn’t there earlier, now all the streams of your corruption 
has dried up, it’s all just dust now. Let’s see what happens, if I am going down, 
I am taking everyone with me. If there is my name in the list 
of people going down, do let me know so I can buy 
a cheap life jacket for myself. Go, get out. Go. Boss, Madam Nusrat. I said get lost. Hello ma’am. Fatima, come into my room. Okay ma’am. Yes. Yes ma’am? I have emailed you a file of Stonebury Okay. And there is another new project 
I am emailing it to you as well Okay. Get the printout of both and make a file
and share it with me. Okay, ma’am.
