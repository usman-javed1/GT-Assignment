Grandma’s love. Grandma took you in her arms 
and you slept immediately. Once grandma sets you down 
you will start crying immediately. Little bundle of joy. This is not right. Grandma wants to play 
and you sleep. I will put you on the bed and 
you will wake up again. Right? Oh my beloved baby. Papa’s princess. Papa’s doll. My Areej. My Salman’s fairy. Beloved. All our beloved. Our life. Areej, grandma is tired, should I make you lie down 
on the bed? For a little while. 
Okay. Hey, hey, that’s it. 
That’s it. Come on. Come on. 
Come on. Come on. 
Come on. Love. Papa’s princess, little fairy. Wasai. Wasai, come and take Areej. You didn’t have the soup. It must have gotten cold by now. I will ask Wasai, to make it again. I don’t want to have soup. I have brought soup for you. I don’t want to have anything 
with your hands. Fine, you have it with your own hands, I just made it. I told you, 
I don’t want to drink it. You will have to drink it and that too for ten days because this is your diet plan. You are just saying 
what you want, you don’t care about 
what I am saying. I care. I care about your health. Why do you care? Let me die. Please aunty, 
don’t say these things. You have to live for Salman’s sake,
 Areej’s sake. Elder madam called me 
with so much anger. But you are coming back smiling. Yes, because she is angry with me. But she has become friends 
with Areej. That had to happen. Okay Wasai, her soup is cold, 
she didn’t drink it, make it again. Sure. Greetings. Yes, Arooj child, how are you? Greetings. I am just fine. I cannot tolerate staying away
 from mama, anymore. I cannot tolerate it. 
What do I do? She is feeling you, Arooj, but right now Mehreen is not 
in the condition that we can give her 
any further shock. You keep yourself in my place
 and think. If you were there, then what would 
you have done? Tell me. You will have to do all this really 
slowly and gradually, child. I don’t have time, mama. I don’t have time. I have to tell Salman, what whose 
relation is with whom. This can make things worse, Arooj. How much worse can it be than
it is right now, mama? I have to save mama and
Salman from their competitors and the greedy people of this home. Competitors? Who are their competitors, child? Uncle and aunt. Uncle and aunt? Okay, Arooj, child, listen. Now you need to be really careful. That’s why I am saying, 
be careful. What if you make a wrong decision? Look mama, now I cannot tolerate staying away
 from my mother. And secondly, I don’t want to give the people 
of this home this much time. Fine, child. Do as you think is right. Bye. Bye, child. Take care of yourself. Wasai, Arooj has always praised you. In her toughest days, you have been her well-wisher. Younger madam is really good
 herself. With this health, why did Arooj come down 
the stairs? Why did she climb down? Were you not there at that time? What do I tell you now? Younger madam, I have told you the entire incident. You still don’t understand? Wasai, I don’t understand the reason for this behaviour of her. Earlier, an attempt was made 
on my life, then they tried to play with 
the life of my daughter. Why is she doing all this? These games of money
is really bad. It makes you do everything. Meaning, that this home, wealth, this entire business, all this belonged to elder sir, and on your birth, elder sir put everything 
in your name. What... What are you saying, Wasai? I am right, younger madam. All this belongs to you. You are the owner of it. Mama says that if I am not careful, 
I will make a mistake. But as much have things 
have deteriorated, how worse can it get? If I can get my mother, then what loss do I have 
to worry about? I hugged my mother, but right now, the mother has 
to hug her daughter. She has to hug me. She has to hug her Arooj. Idrees, why do you look so worried. What happened? 
You had gone to the lawyer. What did he tell you? 
What did he say? Everything is ruined.
Everything is upside down. What do you mean? 
What happened? Waqar put his entire property and
business in Areej’s name. Yes, all of us know that. Waqar died, Areej got lost. So, I got the legal right, so I gave 
Salman all the rights. Idrees, we know all this. What has happened now? 
Tell me. Now the real owner of the business
 and property is here. She will take her right from us. How will she take it like that? If we don’t give it, she will take it
legally. She has a strong case. She is Waqar’s daughter. What is this problem? 
What will we do now? Now you won’t do anything. I will do whatever needs to be done. Me. What happened aunt? I asked Wasai to make 
a cup of tea for you, so she said no to my face, 
she said I am taking care of Areej. I had told Wasai to stay with Areej. Why do you have surveillance 
at home? Couldn’t she leave her 
for two minutes? She couldn’t leave her at all. Why? At times, we become more insecure 
inside the home, than outside. So, you have to keep an eye. What is the matter? Has a new life come 
to this home or did someone die here? I see sorrow on everyone’s face. Mehreen, I am really happy. In fact, we are all very happy. It is just Arooj who is staying 
away from everyone. I will not ask Arooj anything, because the pain she went through, after that a person suffers 
from depression. And then Arooj has given 
my son a big gift. My son is really happy. So what do we do? You tell me. How do we celebrate happiness? It is more important for happiness to 
show on the face, than celebrating it. If we cannot come in front of us 
with a smile on our face, then what is the point of sitting 
across each other and having food. You are right. Wasai, give me my breakfast
 in my room. Wasai, wait. I will take care of it myself. No one else will be able to make 
Areej quiet other than me. Sure, elder madam. Did you see? Did you see how this magician taking
 over the entire environment. Yes, I see it. You are only seeing it, but 
you are not doing anything. Shaista, we cannot bang our head on
the wall for no reason and call it an attempt. We will have to make plans 
to break down the wall. No Idrees, you listen to me carefully. We will never agree that 
she is Waqar’s daughter. We will say she is a fraud. She is lying to take over the wealth 
and business. What are you saying, Shaista, nowadays, you find out immediately 
through DNA testing. I don’t know what all 
you are thinking. I am going to the office. We have two enemies in our home, one is Arooj and 
the other is Mehreen. Now we will do one thing, we will tell Mehreen that 
Salman is not her son, but ours. What will that do? Mehreen will go mad 
out of shock. But our target is Arooj, on whose name 
the entire business is. It is really important 
to defeat Arooj’s luck, we don’t have time. That’s why we will have 
to change the plan. No. No, think of something else. And remember we are going 
against the wind. A little carelessness will throw us at another spot. Remember that. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. Areej, you are really smart. Grandma goes out a little and
 you call her immediately. Who does this? 
Who does this? Huh? Who does this? 
Areej does this. Where is your mama? 
Where is your mama? Call your mama. 
Mama. Mama. She is not coming? 
Okay let’s call papa. Papa. Papa. He is not coming. Both are bad children, 
they left Areej alone. They left my Areej alone. Come we will sit and play, okay? That’s how we play. 
You know how we play? This is your papa’s first birthday gift, which is with Areej right now. See, how is it? Is it pretty? Oh, my love. Okay. That’s it. That’s it. 
That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. 
Areej wants her mama. Shall we call mama? 
Mama. Mama, come on,
 Areej is calling you. Salman. 
Yes? Try to come home early 
in the evening today. Definitely. By the way, can I say something? Yes. Mom’s temperament is changing. You put her to a good task. Her job is to love, but she has seen so much 
difficulty in life that her temperament has 
become bitter. What difficulties? Right now, I put Areej is her lap. Rest will get fine on its own. Everything is fine. What more will get better? You will find out everything 
when the time comes. Okay, I will go. We will meet at night. Take care of yourself. You too. Goodbye. Goodbye. Why are you looking at me 
like that? You called him. Are you satisfied now? You didn’t believe me? It is not about believing 
you sister-in-law, I just called him. The children have their own life, 
Mehreen, let them live it. Don’t monitor and dictate them
 all the time. Hey, sister-in-law, what did I do? I just spoke to my son. Why do you forget that your son 
is also someone’s husband now. Forgetting reminds me. Salman is my son and I am helpless
that Arooj is my daughter in law. But you are the only one who is
aware of things about them and the mother knows nothing. What is the matter? Has a new life come to this home or did someone die here? I see sorrow on everyone’s face. Mehreen, I am really happy. In fact, we are all very happy. It is just Arooj who is staying 
away from everyone. I will not ask Arooj anything, because the pain 
she went through, after that a person suffers 
from depression. And then Arooj has given 
my son a big gift. My son is really happy. This is amazing. Mehreen who was Arooj’s enemy 
till yesterday, today she is showering love on her. What is this drama that is 
going on here? Madam Arooj, what magic wand 
do you have with which you have made someone 
like Mehreen your fan. I will handle you too, Arooj.
