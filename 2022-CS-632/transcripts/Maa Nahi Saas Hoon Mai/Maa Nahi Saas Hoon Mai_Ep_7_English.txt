Master, the gift God gave 
us in our childless life, it is time for that gift to depart. Master, when we had found 
her yesterday, it seems as though 
it was just yesterday. Master, stop the car. Stop the bike, master. What happened? I can hear a child cry. Huh? Hey, no, you must be hearing things. Hear it carefully, 
I can hear it. Yes, Naseema,
 I can hear it. You wait, I will go and see. Okay, you stay here. Naseema, you were right. See, I found a child. See, I had told you 
I could hear a child cry. Where did you find this
 child from? Hey, they were lying 
over there in the bushes. Lying in the bushes? Master, what sort of parents are they. They left the child like 
this in the bushes. God damn them. Master, what will do 
with this child? Lets go to the police station, we will give them this child. No, no, first we will take them home, I don’t know how long 
they must be hungry for. Yes, you are right. See how they became 
quiet coming in my arms. Okay here, take them,
 we will go. I tried everything
 I could that she goes back in the 
arms of her parents. I have tried hard to find out, but I couldn’t find anything. I also went to the spot where
 this child was found from, I even asked people over there, but no one knows 
anything about this girl. If you are not able to find out, 
then leave it. I will hand over this child to the police, they will find her parents themselves. Hey, no, no, master, what are you saying?She is Girl.. I don’t know whose child she is, how can we keep this girl? If you give her to the police, then they will send 
her to the orphanage. You please let her stay with me. I will bring her up like my daughter. I don’t know where her 
poor mother would be? If her mother really 
worried for her, then she wouldn’t have thrown
 her like this and gone. Don’t say that, Naseema. Master, God has blessed us childless people 
with the blessing of a child. God has answered our prayers, why don’t you understand me. That’s it, I have told you, she is my daughter. Okay, look, the bracelet she has in her hands, in it, her name is Areej. I had thought that if we have a daughter, then I will name her Urooj. It is good. There is not a lot of difference 
in Areej and Urooj. That’s it, then. From today, she is our Urooj. Urooj. Urooj. Anyway, whatever God does is for the 
betterment of his servants. Thank God that he filled my empty arms like this. Thank God, Anyway, now you prepare for
 her to be sent off. Child, we tried our best that you never feel any pain, but still if something is left lacking then forgive us child. No… My name is Allah Wasai, madam. I have been working here for ages. If you ever need something, call out to me. Yes, sure. Allah Wasai, where is Salman? He is sitting with his friends, he will come shortly. Can I say something little madam? Yes. You are really pretty. May God give you a good fate. Thank you. I will go now. You must be really happy. But hear one thing clearly. You have trapped my 
Salman in your love, but your love cannot be more than a mother’s love. You can never snatch 
my Salman from me. Wasai, did you take out the 
milk in the glass? Yes, madam, here it is. Wasai, who is this milk for? For Salman. The thing that didn’t happen
 in the past twenty five years, why is it happening today? When everything about 
Salman is done with my will, then why have you still 
not understood it, Wasai? Madam had asked me. Why don’t you understand this,
 sister in law? When will you too understand this? What happened? Nothing. No, something has happened. I can see it clearly. There is nothing. Then what happened? Aunty came right now, she said that I trapped you in my love. Meaning, me loving you, is trapping you. Really? Did she say this to you? Yes. Why are you laughing? Obviously, I am laughing thinking 
that you love me. When did I say that? Just now. You accepted it just now. You know, can I say something? Yes. You look even more 
beautiful laughing. I forgot an important 
thing in all this. Wait a second. Here is your wedding gift. How do you like it? It is really beautiful. Yes, it is beautiful. But not more than you. When will sister in law Shaista
 stop doing what she wants? Why doesn’t she understand? Why doesn’t she understand that something so important about Salman is being done without my will? All these people have gone mad, and they call me mad. They will find out. They will find out one day. They will find out. Salman, can I ask you something? Go ahead. Did aunt Mehreen have a problem with the
 love we have between us? You didn’t answer me. Can I say something? Yes. You wont mind, right? No. Actually, the thing is that mom is really
 possessive towards me. She doesn’t like sharing
 my love with anyone else. What happened? What are you thinking? I am just trying to understand that what is my fault in all this? I am your wife. Urooj, I know you are my wife, and you have your 
own place in my life. And trust me, I have no objection 
on your rights. If you don’t have an 
objection on my love, and if anyone else has it, then that is not my issue. You are calling mom, anyone else? Then aunty too should think that I am not anyone else, I am your wife. Then remember one thing, she is my mother and don’t try to show your 
right on me in front of her. She wont like it. I hope you understood what I said. Salman. Hey son, stop. Salman. Salman. Salman. Salman. Salman. Salman. Wasai. Wasai. Why is madam calling me? Yes, coming madam. Wasai. Yes. Yes, coming madam. Yes, elder madam? What happened? Are you feeling okay? Where is my Salman? Why are you not answering me? Say something? Elder madam, he is in his room. What is he doing there at this hour? You are forgetting, he got married today. If you want, should 
I call madam? No, don’t send anyone. No one at all. Leave. Go from here. Okay. My Salman… my Salman got married and I don’t even remember. Here you go. Yum. How is it? It is tasty. Since when did you start 
having fried flatbread? Mom, Urooj made me try it. 
It is really delicious. Wasai. Yes, elder madam? Have you forgotten the 
breakfast Salman has. No, I will just bring it. You know there is no harm in 
changing the taste some times. No one has permission to 
bring change in my life. Right, son Salman? Yes, mama. I just suggested it. Urooj, come to me when I see off, Salman. I have to show you something. Sure. What happened to you? Nothing happened right now, I don’t know how long it 
is happening to me. You once again want to 
talk about Mehreen and Salman? I just don’t want to talk, I want to scream. I want to scream and tell everyone
 what I am going through. Okay. Okay. Cool down. Tell me, what is the matter? Salman is my son, who I had breastfed in childhood. Mehreen didn’t like me taking 
a glass of milk for that same son? She stopped me so badly that I was shocked. Yes, Mehreen is like this 
regarding Salman. Then what should I do? What should I do? How long do I stop myself? We will be the only parents
 in the world, who attended their own
 son’s wedding as guests. Did I not plan anything 
being a mother? I can understand the reason 
of you being upset. You do one thing, invite Salman and Urooj for a party. Yes, this will give your heart a little peace. Okay? Take care of yourself. You had to show me something, 
aunty? Yes. Today I have to reveal some 
important secrets in life to you today. Yes? My Salman and I are incomplete without each other. I know that. We must have heard two 
heart and one life. Yes, I have heard it. Good. Come with me. Only I take care of Salman’s things. You must be thinking why I do this? So that one day I can surprise my Salman. But anyway, why am I telling you all this? Come on, let’s go forward. Never open this room, Urooj. Why? What is there in it? This is my Salman’s 
childhood room. This has all of my Salman’s
 childhood toys, with which he used to play. It has all the toys that he
 got after insistence. Even all those toys that
 broke on the first day, and also those that he would keep next to 
his pillow and sleep. Remember one thing, never make the mistake
 of opening this room. What is the matter, Wasai? Why all this? Is there something special today? Yes, yes, today little master and little
 madam have a feast. A feast in our home? Yes. What is this, Wasai? I am sure, this is 
sister in law’s thought. Yes, yes, elder madam, madam had told me. Fine. I will take care of it. How can anyone decide 
anything about my Salman. My Salman is being 
invited for a feast, and his mother doesn’t know. It is so weird. Send someone from the 
accounts, please. Sure. Yes, Shaista. You just come early today… Sister in law, Shaista, what is this I hear? You have organized a feast for Urooj 
and Salman, without my will. You didn’t even bother asking me. Hello. Hello. You don’t say anything. Let me talk her. Idrees. Yes, brother Idrees? Mehreen, you know how much Salman
 loves surprises. So we thought that your Salman will get happy. I was just going to call you, because we cannot invite Salman 
without your permission. If you don’t want it then I will say no to Shaista. No, no, brother Idrees, there is nothing like that. I have no objection. Yes, but brother Idrees, I want to get the food my Salman
 likes cooked myself. Why not? Why not? As you wish. Whatever you will. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hello. Wasai. What is the matter? Why did you stop 
working? Huh? Come on, quickly 
start working. And yes, there is minced meat for 
the kebabs in the fridge. Take that out. Prepare delicious kebabs, and we will also make other
 delicious food too. We will make all that will
 make my son happy. Sure. Sure. I will organize such a party
 for my son today, that he will be left staring. Come on, quickly start working. Meanwhile, I will give Rehman 
baba the list of the other things, we have to prepare a lot more. Be quick. Sure Hello. Yes, I handed over the file
 to your assistant. Yes. Alright, see you tomorrow. Bye. How do I look? As usual, really beautiful. I just wanted to hear that. Come on, get fresh, aunt must be waiting for us. Fine, I will go and get fresh. Come quickly. What is the matter Urooj? Why are you so overdressed? It is just an ordinary dinner at home. Aunty, a party is a party and then aunt organized a diner with 
so much love for us, so I need to dress up. She called you with my agreement. If I don’t allow it, then Salman 
wont even step there. In future, don’t wear such clothes that Salman has to praise you. Anyway, you go, sister in law Shaista must
be waiting for you over dinner. Till then I will check on Salman. This boy doesn’t even take 
a single step without me.
