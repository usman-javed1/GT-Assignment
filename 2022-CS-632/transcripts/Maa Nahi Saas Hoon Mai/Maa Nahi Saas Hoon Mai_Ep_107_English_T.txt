[68.52] You pushed my father? 
Huh?
[70.76] You pushed him?
[72.56] Push me.
Hit me.
[75.20] Why don’t you hit me?
[77.24] What do you think of yourself?
[78.84] What is this arrogance for?
[81.12] Respect. 
Fame.
[83.00] Why are you quiet? 
Speak up.
[84.92] Lower your voice.
[87.64] This is my home,
[89.20] you are not allowed to 
talk loudly here.
[91.76] I will talk loudly.
[94.64] And what is this home 
you are talking about?
[98.48] Two minutes.
[100.20] The ground from under your feet
will be pulled, in two minutes.
[108.28] Areej.
[110.20] Areej.
[112.12] You cannot take Areej.
[113.52] You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother.
[115.68] I will stop you.
Leave me.
[117.44] Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it.
[118.92] Leave it…
[203.32] When you cannot handle the bike,
[204.88] then why do you bring it 
on the road at this age?
[206.80] Do you see, 
you put a dent in my car?
[210.76] You are right, Salman.
[213.08] It is my fault.
[217.92] You want to embarrass me 
by saying all this, right?
[220.40] Like it is all my fault and you didn’t 
do anything. That’s how it is, right?
[223.12] No, there is nothing like that,
I came to talk to you.
[228.16] When I have told you that 
I don’t want to talk to you,
[230.96] then why are you after me 
like a beggar?
[232.92] Go from here.
[235.88] You are right,
[237.56] the father of the girl is a beggar 
in front of a rich son in law.
[243.12] Don’t speak too many dialogues 
in front of me.
[245.76] Guards, pick up his bike and 
take it into custody.
[248.28] Till the time he doesn’t pay up,
he will not get his bike.
[265.76] No, no, Salman,
 don’t do this.
[267.64] Stop them. Hey, 
where are you taking it.
[269.84] Salman. Stop them, 
Salman.
[272.28] Where are they taking my bike?
Salman.
[274.92] Salman, don’t do this.
Look…
[297.32] What happened?
[299.44] Why did you stop?
[301.24] Hit me.
[303.44] I would have surely hit you,
[305.52] if the mark from last night’s slap
hadn’t left your face.
[314.92] Why did you come here?
[316.36] And I knew you would do this.
[323.08] That’s why I followed you 
and came here.
[326.16] Who told you to come here?
[329.24] Child, I wanted to talk to Salman.
[350.00] Hah,
[351.64] there is no benefit of banging 
your head on the walls, papa.
[362.44] Come on, papa.
[388.16] Come on, guards.
[427.92] Miss Muqadas, 
did Mr. Salman come?
[429.96] No sir, he is not here yet.
[433.16] Fine, when he comes 
give him this file.
[436.36] Okay, sir.
[438.88] Miss Dua, how are you?
[440.32] Fine, sir.
[442.04] Do you feel the weird environment
of the office,
[445.08] or am I the only one who feels it?
[448.32] Yes, sir, it is not like earlier.
[454.12] Even boss is not coming.
[455.48] The files are piled up on the table.
[457.84] Even Mr. Salman comes 
for a little while,
[459.88] and he keeps on sitting 
in a weird state.
[462.24] Yes, sir. 
Do you know?
[466.56] Yesterday, sir called me in the office,
and scolded me so much.
[469.00] He said I have ordered coffee 
for so long,
[471.48] it is still not here.
[475.36] I stayed completely quiet.
[477.20] Three coffee cups were kept 
on the side table,
[479.48] sir didn’t touch a single cup.
[485.20] I am not getting good vibes.
[487.68] Anyway, God is great.
[492.16] Miss Muqadas look at this.
[510.72] Is everything okay?
[512.84] Why are you walking like this?
I am fine. I am fine.
[519.32] Where did you go?
[522.92] I went to meet Salman.
[532.68] To meet Salman?
[534.84] Why?
[538.08] To talk about your issue.
[549.92] I told him to save his home
from being ruined.
[559.56] Then? Then what did he say?
[563.32] He cursed me.
[572.68] And he pushed me down.
[599.08] Sit down comfortably.
[600.40] You two went separately,
[604.76] but you both came together.
[609.16] Because the two of us went 
to the same place.
[620.24] Where did you people go?
[623.68] Papa should answer this,
[626.04] but I will tell you where we went.
[636.92] He was going to Salman’s office
[654.32] and I had an idea, 
he would go there,
[656.60] that is why I followed him there.
[672.56] What is wrong with you?
[674.84] Why did you go there?
[683.52] What did Salman do?
[686.28] He did what he had done 
earlier as well.
[697.48] In fact, maybe
[699.32] this time he did something 
even more dangerous.
[710.36] God be kind.
[712.52] What did Salman do?
[715.64] He hit papa’s motorcycle 
with his car.
[727.08] Thank God, no big accident occurred.
[731.12] Hey, he didn’t hit it on purpose.
[746.88] It was just a coincidence.
[749.28] Papa, why don’t you say it,
[751.28] that he tried to kill you.
[765.32] Arooj is right.
[767.56] Salman is crazy,
[770.08] he can do anything.
[771.80] Hey, all of you people 
get on one side.
[775.00] My opinion has no importance.
[798.48] Listen to me. 
He is a good boy.
[812.00] Just Idrees and Shaista have
 driven him mad.
[818.72] He is not a child, papa.
[827.92] He is a well-known 
businessman of the city;
[831.12] he cannot be misled by anyone.
[847.80] Whatever he did, 
he did in his senses.
[878.68] I am surprised, Master,
[880.72] so much happened but 
you are still mistaken.
[886.52] I am not mistaken, Naseema.
[890.00] You will see,
[891.64] Salman will come one day
[893.84] and take his Arooj.
[899.32] May God bless us with 
what you are saying.
[912.48] But I don’t think this will happen.
[915.44] Salman is a stonehearted man,
[918.56] just like his mother.
[943.32] Hey, no sister Mehreen,
[945.56] I didn’t mean you.
[953.88] I was talking about sister Shaista.
[958.16] I am his mother.
[977.52] But he is not like me at all.
[996.64] It's uncertain
[999.40] whether the mother is the one
who gives birth or
[1002.96] the one who raises the child.
[1020.76] Which statement is true?
[1027.28] I don’t understand.
[1084.16] You are fine, right?
[1086.04] Did you get hurt?
[1088.52] Hey, no Naseema,
[1090.60] the car hit the bike, I remained safe.
[1094.36] Nothing happened to me.
[1096.80] Thank God.
[1099.64] I will bring water for you. 
Go, bring water.
[1128.76] When you cannot handle the bike,
[1130.36] then why do you bring it 
on the road at this age?
[1132.32] Do you see,
 you put a dent in my car?
[1136.28] You are right, Salman.
[1138.56] It is my fault.
[1143.36] You want to embarrass me 
by saying all this, right?
[1145.76] Like it is all my fault and you didn’t 
do anything. That’s how it is, right?
[1148.80] No, there is nothing like that, 
I came to talk to you.
[1153.68] When I have told you that 
I don’t want to talk to you,
[1156.28] then why are you after me
like a beggar?
[1158.52] Go from here.
[1161.36] You are right,
[1163.00] the father of the girl is a beggar 
in front of a rich son in law.
[1168.60] Don’t speak too many dialogues 
in front of me.
[1171.20] Guards, pick up his bike and 
take it into custody.
[1173.92] Till the time he doesn’t pay up, 
he will not get his bike.
[1241.84] Keep my coat in my room. 
Fine, sir.
[1245.40] Hello, son. 
How are you?
[1249.40] He survived again.
[1253.44] Who?
[1255.64] The same, master Shoaib.
[1267.56] He came to my office today.
[1270.28] I hit his bike with my car.
[1273.88] Then?
[1276.32] Then, what?
[1278.24] The old man survived.
[1280.80] Salman, what are you doing, son?
[1290.84] Don’t do this.
[1292.40] This way, you will be in trouble.
[1294.48] For God’s sake, mom,
[1297.08] it was a small accident, 
what else?
[1311.04] After all,
[1314.00] I am tired of this family.
[1327.44] Until I erase them from existence,
[1330.96] I will not find peace.
[1395.08] When a person comes home,
[1397.40] you ask how they are.
[1403.16] You don’t start questioning them.
[1407.96] You have come really late, 
that’s only why I am asking.
[1411.40] I am not a school going child,
[1413.48] that I go on time and 
come back on time.
[1419.12] I am a businessman,
[1424.20] people know me as Salman.
[1428.32] No one knows me as your son.
[1433.80] But nowadays you don’t go
to the office, right?
[1439.08] Why do you ask?
[1440.96] I am your mother, that is why
I am asking.
[1444.36] Ask me questions
[1447.32] that match the type of 
mother you are.
[1513.20] Naseema, I fear that all my efforts
 may go in vain.
[1519.24] All your efforts have become 
useless, Master.
[1534.16] This matter will not be resolved
[1537.40] the way you are thinking.
[1541.48] Yes, I have an idea.
[1555.44] But that fear doesn’t leave my heart.
[1562.48] If we sit quietly being fearful,
[1568.80] then we will not be able to do 
anything for Arooj.
[1575.24] If Arooj finds everything and 
loses her relation with Salman,
[1581.08] then it will be a terrible deal.
[1585.00] This relation is between them;
[1594.20] it cannot be saved with 
one person’s sacrifice.
[1606.44] Master,
[1608.40] Salman has forgotten
[1611.16] that there is some Arooj 
in his life.
[1617.04] When Salman’s eyes will be opened,
he will find out,
[1628.88] that his parents sacrificed his wife
and daughter because of their greed.
[1635.56] We will have to sort this matter
before that time comes.
[1649.12] So that Salman too gets a chance
to understand the truth.
[1658.16] Look,
[1659.84] this is a matter of Arooj’s life
[1667.08] and Mehreen is her mother,
[1670.44] ask her once again.
[1673.80] I have already asked her
[1677.00] and she too wants legal action 
to be taken.
[1686.20] And she wants that her daughter 
gets her, right.
[1694.92] Fine.
[1696.52] Let’s do it.
[1709.64] I will talk to the lawyer.
[1752.04] I have ruined it?
[1755.12] How dare you say something 
so useless to me?
[1758.88] Actually,
[1760.64] Areej is also with you,
[1763.32] so Arooj is crying continuously.
[1767.52] Have mercy on her.
[1771.36] There is still time.
[1774.08] Leave from here, or else I will have 
the guard drag you out.
[1778.92] Don’t do that.
[1780.84] My daughter will go mad.
[1784.96] Really?
[1787.32] So, she is your daughter?
[1791.92] With what relation?
[1795.80] You can say anything,
[1798.24] but don’t separate Areej and 
Arooj from you.
[1801.88] Please.
[1806.00] Don’t try to dictate me.
[1811.04] Get out of here.
