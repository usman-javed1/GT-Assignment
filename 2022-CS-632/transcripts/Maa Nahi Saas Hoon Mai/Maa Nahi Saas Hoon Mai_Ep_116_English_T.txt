[21.52] Both of us have been 
deceived by the same person.
[35.40] The only difference is that
[38.84] you don’t want to 
accept that deceit.
[51.12] You are the one who is deceiving
[59.52] by lying that
[61.16] you are Idrees’ wife.
[69.84] You are acting.
[73.32] I came to tell you the truth here.
[87.36] Okay, then tell me,
[91.24] what lie have you
 come up with this time?
[93.68] Tell me.
[95.16] I told you, I don’t want to talk to you.
[105.68] I just want to talk to my husband.
[108.80] That’s it?
[111.60] Don’t say anything more
[117.84] or else I will throw you out.
[130.40] You cannot do this,
[141.20] because both 
our status is the same.
[154.44] We’re both Idress’ wives
[162.92] and both of us have one son.
[168.52] You have told me these 
false stories already.
[181.48] And you must remember,
[182.92] how you left embarrassed.
[191.92] The same thing will happen 
with you this time as well.
[195.68] The truth and
 lie will be revealed soon.
[211.24] And time will also tell 
who will leave this home embarrassed.
[245.40] Fine,
[247.64] then we will decide about this,
 today and right now.
[279.40] You stand up in front
 of Idrees for your right,
[287.36] and wherever you will need me,
[289.84] I will support you at every step.
[297.76] Thank you so much for your love,
[304.00] but now I don’t need 
any help from you,
[314.44] because now I want 
to fight this battle myself.
[324.20] I wish.
[326.76] I wish, you had supported 
me at that time,
[333.12] then you too wouldn’t have
 been sitting in front of me like this.
[469.40] Yes, Shaista.
[470.68] You come back home right now.
[474.92] Why? What happened?
[476.60] That….
[479.64] that woman,
[481.00] that lying woman has 
come back home today.
[484.20] What, lying woman?
[485.68] The same…
[489.28] that Musarrat,
[496.52] who claims that she is 
your second wife.
[500.36] Hey, you drag her out.
[503.36] How do I drag her out?
[505.20] She has clearly told me that
[507.28] she didn’t come here 
with the intention to leave.
[510.32] So, what does she want?
[512.64] How would I know what she wants?
[514.68] I will know when she talks to me.
[523.92] She wants to talk to you.
[527.72] Okay fine, I am coming.
[529.80] I will come.
[530.88] Come home, immediately.
[540.72] I just came home,
[541.76] you didn’t greet me or anything
[542.52] and you are using 
this tone straight away?
[543.80] To be greeted, you need to ...
[545.52] ...do things that make 
me want to greet you.
[548.04] And you?
[549.16] Hey Musarrat,
[550.36] you were not this
 ill-mannered earlier.
[552.44] Your deception 
wasn’t revealed on me earlier,
[554.96] You have lied so much to me, Idrees,
[558.52] that I have started to hate
 myself for the decision to marry you.
[563.08] Hey, Musarrat, you are my wife.
[565.52] Second.
[566.32] The second wife
 is also a wife, Musarrat.
[568.96] Yes, absolutely.
[570.40] The first wife is living 
in luxuries in a big home,
[576.60] and me and my son,
[578.56] we are caged in this small home.
[581.68] Why are you in such a bad mood?
 What is the matter?
[585.00] My fate is bad.
[586.36] Hey, so everything will be fine.
[587.76] Enough, Idrees. Enough.
[589.52] I don’t want to hear
 any other lie from you.
[591.68] I am tired of hearing your lies.
[594.60] I am surprised.
[598.48] What amazing dreams
 did you show me?
[655.60] Son,
[656.24] we have to look at
 the quotation of Bunyaad Builders,
[657.88] but I am going right now.
[659.32] What happened? All okay?
[660.56] That fraudster, that lying woman
[662.08] is back at home again.
 She is sitting there.
[664.68] What do you mean 
she has come back?
[670.92] How can she come back?
[676.76] What is the matter?
[678.40] I want to know what the matter is,
 that is why I am going.
[680.40] Wait dad
[682.52] You won’t be able to do anything,
[683.56] I will make arrangements for her.
[685.20] Leave it, son. I will handle it.
[686.80] If you were able to handle it,
[688.36] she wouldn’t have come back.
[694.36] I will go with you, 
I will deal with her.
[713.64] She is here.
[719.64] Greetings.
[720.72] Greetings.
[722.28] I will close it.
[733.32] Did Areej bother you?
[736.48] If Areej bothers me, 
then she has a right.
[745.52] I didn’t have you to bother me,
 at this age.
[758.12] Now Areej will do it.
[761.84] This is also right.
[764.60] I will serve food for you.
[767.12] You must be tired.
[768.36] No, no, mama,
[769.44] I had lunch.
[775.80] I just had a lot of work at the office,
[777.96] I am really tired.
[785.16] Look Arooj,
[786.68] if the workload is a lot, then quit it.
[789.56] God will be kind,
[791.16] manage to get through life.
[793.88] Your life doesn’t pass by quitting work.
[800.00] To live your life, you have to fight,
[802.76] you have to snatch your right.
[806.88] All these things only sound good.
[812.64] Taking your right is really difficult.
[816.04] It is not impossible, though.
[820.00] So,
[824.56] what will you do?
[827.52] I will do something.
[828.96] I have thought about it.
[832.24] What will you do?
[834.20] Wont you tell me?
[841.24] You will be the first person
 I will tell when the time comes.
[846.32] Look Arooj,
[848.44] remember one thing,
[853.92] we are really weak people.
[857.24] Showing yourself as weak,
 is strengthening the enemy.
[864.32] Fine.
[869.32] Whatever you do,
[870.68] do it really carefully.
[877.00] Because now I don’t have 
the courage to hear any bad news.
[893.32] Don’t worry,
[895.92] your daughter will not be unsuccessful.
[912.92] You have brought up Salman really well.
[919.64] You have brought him 
up as an exemplary mother.
[926.04] But he has lost his way, mama,
[929.20] and there is no way to return.
[937.08] This is equally painful 
for me as it is for you.
[944.04] But I feel the sooner we accept this,
[951.12] the better it will be for me.
[961.68] If a modest person steps
 back from a person,
[965.20] then the immodest person
 feels they are cowards.
[969.00] And do you know?
[970.84] Not raising your voice for your rights
 is also a great ingratitude to God.
[981.56] I have decided,
[983.96] I will stand up for my right.
[987.36] And now, I will not
 listen to anyone of you.
[1025.20] Where is that Musarrat?
[1026.68] Yes.
[1029.16] She is sitting inside, in the lounge.
[1031.80] Mom, we wouldn’t have
 had to come here,
[1033.36] if you had dragged her out.
[1036.48] Yes.
[1037.84] She is sitting here strongly.
[1043.16] If she had made noise at the door,
[1045.08] then what could we have done?
[1050.44] Child, Shaista is right,
[1052.24] there should be no noise.
[1053.88] Don’t worry,
[1058.68] if she does this, then
[1061.24] I will shut her up.
[1118.12] Come Idrees.
[1121.88] Tell her.
[1123.92] Tell her what her worth is.
[1127.72] Idrees, tell her,
[1130.52] who am I? what am I?
[1137.28] We know who you are,
[1141.16] but we want to hear 
it from your mouth once.
[1147.60] Me?
[1152.36] I am a mother.
[1162.48] Whose mother?
[1165.80] I am the mother of Idrees’ son.
[1177.80] I am the mother of Idrees’ son.
[1187.24] And here is my son.
[1192.04] Yes,
[1193.48] and Idrees just doesn’t have one son.
[1202.12] You are lying.
[1209.08] You have come up with this story,
 seeing our wealth and money.
[1223.68] Okay,
[1225.52] lets believe it for a while,
[1228.64] that you are speaking the truth.
[1235.60] But do you have any proof that
[1238.48] you are Idrees’ wife, huh?
[1245.84] Proof?
[1252.88] Here is the proof.
[1254.16] Our wedding papers.
[1285.28] We have been married
 for fourteen years.
[1305.24] Idrees.
[1307.48] Idrees, what is she saying?
[1310.24] What is she saying? Answer me.
[1312.28] Is she speaking the truth.
[1314.08] It is nothing,
[1315.24] such wedding papers
 can be made easily.
[1317.32] Yes.
[1324.08] After all,
[1330.20] no one will believe these 
fake wedding papers of yours,
[1338.40] so it will be better that 
you leave from here.
[1342.92] I came here to get my right,
[1345.72] and I will leave when I get it.
[1352.92] I need respect, I need a name.
[1356.12] What right?
[1358.12] When you have no relation with him,
[1359.52] then what right have 
you come here to claim?
[1372.28] If I don’t get my right,
[1375.44] then I will take help from the law.
[1383.52] And remember,
[1385.92] I will take my right
[1394.44] So, you will take me to court?
[1396.84] Yes.
[1398.44] I will take you to the court
[1406.24] and I will also handover your son to you,
[1409.20] so that he gets your name.
[1425.32] You have humiliated me in my home.
[1433.60] No door for compromise is left open.
[1440.60] Cunning woman,
[1442.24] I will not let you cause any more pain.
[1449.00] You wait here. Wait.
[1469.96] Here you go.
[1470.76] Your divorce papers.
[1481.60] From now on, you are free. Yes.
[1497.56] I hid it from you,
[1500.12] forgive me. I am really tired.
[1527.08] I don’t want this paper.
[1534.32] I want my right.
[1536.28] My wedding gift.
[1545.76] How much is your wedding gift?
[1550.68] Twenty-five hundred 
thousand rupees.
[1599.36] Here you go.
[1616.20] Don’t come here again.
[1624.40] I will have to come.
[1631.80] To take the right of my son.
[1642.60] I am leaving from here right now,
[1645.88] but I will surely come again.
[1668.28] What was all this?
[1670.68] You had married for 
the second time,
[1672.24] that too hiding it from mom?
[1694.64] I didn’t put any allegation.
[1696.48] Uncle got married
[1697.92] and getting married is not a sin.
[1699.92] Arooj don’t say anything
 baseless in front of me.
[1701.96] I am telling you.
[1703.28] I didn’t say anything baseless.
[1706.08] Arooj,
[1707.76] I am warning you,
[1708.72] stop all this or you
 will see the worst in me.
[1711.60] I am speaking the truth, Salman.
[1713.40] I have met her myself.
[1731.96] Shaista, listen to me.
[1735.28] I don’t want to hear anything.
[1738.36] I don’t want to.
[1743.20] You have cheated me.
[1746.48] You kept on lying again and again.
[1758.60] I am so stupid.
[1763.68] I considered you to be honest
[1767.20] and considered that 
woman to be bad.
[1773.32] Look, whatever happened,
 it hurt you. Forgive me for this.
[1776.76] I should forgive you?
[1779.36] You have lied to two 
women at the same time
[1785.92] and you are saying
 it so easily that
[1787.80] I should forgive you?
[1791.72] Mom.
[1797.84] Please, take it easy.
[1799.56] How do I take it easy?
[1800.68] How can I take it easy,
 finding out all this?
[1804.16] Mom, look,
[1805.84] when you found out the truth,
[1807.44] the next moment it ended as well.
[1817.28] You didn’t even have 
to face a moment of pain.
[1823.48] And can you not 
see what I am feeling?
[1832.04] I understand this, but please,
[1835.56] you try to forget this.
[1842.24] Salman, is…right…
[1864.72] Mom. Mom.
[1949.08] Okay,
[1950.92] lets believe it for a while,
[1953.96] that you are speaking the truth.
[1957.24] But do you have any proof
[1960.00] that you are Idrees’ wife,
[1964.52] Proof?
[1971.48] Here is the proof.
[1972.84] Our wedding papers.
[1987.72] We have been married 
for fourteen years.
[1995.60] Mom. Please, take it easy.
[2000.72] Mom, look,
[2002.44] when you found out the truth,
[2003.92] the next moment it ended as well.
[2011.76] You didn’t even have 
to face a moment of pain.
[2015.60] And can you not 
see what I am feeling?
[2022.12] I understand this, but please,
[2025.68] you try to forget this.
[2036.64] I forget it?
[2039.28] How can I forget it?
[2043.56] How?
[2049.88] Idrees brought 
my lifelong hard work,
[2054.32] my love, my wishes, my sacrifices ...
[2057.80] ...to the ground in one moment.
[2073.00] I trusted you so much, Idrees.
[2084.08] I couldn’t even think, Idrees,
[2086.00] that you would do this with me.
[2096.60] Why did you do this?
[2100.52] Why did you do it? Why?
[2109.16] Why has she called me?
[2117.04] Why did you call me?
[2119.80] To tell you, aunt,
[2122.28] that a person reaps 
what they sow.
[2131.76] You deceived 
people all their lives.
[2139.24] You have murdered their trust,
[2146.92] but maybe you had 
forgotten something,
[2150.52] that is karma.
[2153.44] Stop your nonsense.
[2156.40] Did you call me to 
speak this nonsense?
[2161.44] Aunt, I can understand
[2163.76] the pain and torture you 
are going through right now.
[2167.04] Hun...
[2168.52] Who told you that
 I am in pain?
[2172.64] Closing your eyes, 
doesn’t change the reality, aunt.
[2184.12] Do you remember aunt?
[2186.32] You have helped me
a lot in my difficult times.
[2195.44] That’s why I too thought that
[2197.96] I would console you 
a little in your difficult times.
[2201.44] That was my fault.
[2204.04] I mistook a snake for a rope.”.
[2213.20] Arooj, I made a mistake
 in recognizing you.
[2216.36] No, no, no, aunt.
[2218.24] Not me,
[2220.24] actually, you have made 
a mistake in recognizing uncle.
[2231.96] He belonged to aunt 
Musarrat fourteen years back.
[2235.68] Shut up. Just shut up.
[2239.40] Be strong aunt,
[2242.32] the game has just begun.
[2248.96] And remember,
[2251.00] God’s stick is soundless
[2259.28] and when it tightens,
[2262.80] it jolts sinners like 
you to their senses.
