[42.88] Salman.
[46.08] It is good I found you here, 
I was coming to your room.
[50.76] Go ahead, son.
[59.16] Are you worried? 
Is everything fine?
[67.64] Yes.
[70.12] I am worried cause of Arooj.
[72.52] Why?
[73.40] Did Arooj say something?
[75.60] That’s the problem.
[77.84] She is not saying anything.
[84.40] She is quiet in response 
to every question.
[88.32] So child, what should that girl do?
[93.60] She says anything, Mehreen has 
an issue,
[97.00] if she doesn’t, then you.
[100.68] Aunt, I am really serious 
about this matter.
[104.40] You also understand this,
[107.08] that last night Mehreen made her 
apologize and insulted her.
[115.72] Now if she is quiet, 
then let her be quiet.
[123.16] Give her some time, 
she will be fine.
[126.92] No.
[129.92] Something is wrong with Arooj. 
There is something wrong.
[133.00] Wrong?
[135.04] Tell me clearly what the matter is.
[138.56] You know what?
[140.72] Her mother was unwell, 
and she didn’t go to meet her.
[146.52] When I told her that I will take her, 
she said no.
[153.32] You tell me yourself, 
isn’t this strange?
[158.48] Really?
[160.64] It is strange.
[166.28] She really loves her mother.
[168.92] Exactly,
[170.80] now you tell me yourself, should I 
not get serious for this matter?
[176.24] So, you think this as well
[179.16] that after that happened, 
it is possible
[181.68] that the mother and daughter 
have some friction.
[184.12] I don’t know.
[185.24] That is why I need to confirm this.
[193.00] You try to talk to Arooj.
[196.64] I will talk to her, 
you don’t worry.
[199.52] You go to the office.
[201.08] Where is Arooj?
[204.08] I don’t know.
[205.28] Fine, you go, I will talk to her.
[221.80] Her mother was unwell, and
 she didn’t go to meet her.
[232.96] When I told her that I will take her, 
she said no.
[239.72] You tell me yourself, 
isn’t this strange?
[318.32] Why do I feel there is a secret that
[321.84] you don’t want to share with me?
[328.96] it is better that some secrets 
remain secrets.
[334.84] What do you mean?
[337.04] If they get revealed,
[339.28] they become a story full of fun 
for the world,
[345.44] and the one whose secret it is, 
a torture for them.
[351.24] Arooj, what are you saying?
[355.00] I feel I am talking to such an Arooj, 
who I don’t know.
[422.16] If you want,
[424.20] I can drop you to your mother’s home.
[426.72] You will feel better.
[428.52] No.
[430.60] Wont you go to ask how she is?
[433.40] What happened to her?
[438.56] She must be fine.
[441.68] Why are you talking in 
such a cold tone?
[448.40] The ones who burn in their own sorrow,
[452.88] they become of this cold tone.
[459.56] If I am not wrong,
[462.56] then are you having an issue
 with your mother?
[491.20] Arooj,
[493.88] you are sitting here
[495.44] and I was going to look for you 
in your room.
[498.32] Sit.
[501.36] What happened to you? Huh?
[504.80] Salman sent you here too?
[506.96] Yes, think that.
[509.72] You can talk to me, right?
[512.44] Tell me, what is the matter?
[515.28] What?
[516.40] That what is the issue between 
you and your mother?
[532.44] There is no issue, aunt.
[535.64] Look here.
[538.36] She is your mother, child.
[540.84] You don’t get upset with 
your mother.
[546.64] If there is something,
 then I will come along.
[550.20] I will talk to your mother. 
I will make her understand.
[561.28] Thank you so much that 
you thought of doing this.
[572.28] But there are certain things,
[576.68] that cannot even be resolved, 
even after being cleared.
[579.60] This means, there is something. Right?
[583.88] Yes.
[586.36] There is always something 
in everything.
[593.68] The only difference is that
[596.24] at times that thing weighs more, 
at times it weighs less.
[602.76] Fine, I got it.
[604.32] You don’t want to tell me.
[607.48] You don’t consider me your own.
[613.92] The ones who I considered 
my own, they…
[631.24] Aunt,
[636.08] it is just you in this home,
[639.32] whom I can call my own.
[642.80] I know child.
[650.64] That’s it,
[651.96] now you will go to your mother, 
you will meet her.
[660.40] And this is my order.
[662.40] I will not hear anything else,
 okay?
[672.08] I will have to go now,
[676.04] it is aunt’s orders.
[689.24] Fine aunt, I will go.
[693.84] Live long.
[730.96] Greetings sir. 
Greetings.
[750.64] Hello.
[752.04] Yes, Salman. How are you?
[754.60] I am fine, buddy, but
[757.36] this time Arooj is in a weird condition 
this time.
[759.92] You must have done something weird.
[763.56] No, nothing like that.
[767.04] Then aunt Mehreen must have 
said something.
[770.24] Not even that.
[771.72] Then ask her what the matter is.
[774.48] That’s the problem, man.
[777.04] Whenever I ask her, she doesn’t answer me,
she doesn’t tell me anything.
[780.52] Yes, but Salman, you must have 
some idea where the problem is.
[785.96] I feel that
[789.60] this time she has a complaint 
from her parents.
[793.00] My advice is Salman, 
let this matter go on like this.
[798.48] Give Arooj some time.
[800.40] She will tell you herself 
what the matter is.
[803.92] Okay, we will see.
[806.40] Fine, take care of yourself.
[808.32] Goodbye.
[853.24] Aunty, where is Arooj?
I don’t see her.
[855.84] Arooj?
[857.96] Arooj didn’t come here.
[859.84] She didn’t come here?
[862.92] But she told me on the phone that
[865.24] she was coming to ask how you are.
[869.36] Son, Salman, did she say that?
[874.04] Then why didn’t she come here?
[878.52] I don’t know.
[902.76] How long will you think like this?
[907.92] Master,
[910.84] if I don’t think, then what do I do?
[920.12] This changed behavior of Arooj 
really hurts me.
[931.00] Earlier, her phone used to be off,
[934.56] so I understood,
[938.64] but now it constantly rings
[943.36] and she doesn’t answer my call.
[948.20] After that incident,
[950.00] even I don’t have anything 
to console you.
[956.84] Does she herself also think that 
we married her at the wrong place?
[962.80] It is possible
[965.84] but I am sure,
[969.20] my daughter is really patient,
[975.64] and Salman loves her a lot.
[983.52] But
[986.84] there is something else.
[990.64] How will we find out 
what this something else is?
[998.08] Who will tell us, 
if Arooj doesn’t tell us?
[1003.68] God knows.
[1006.44] I will call her.
[1041.16] Papa is calling?
[1049.72] Hello. Greetings, papa.
[1052.40] Greetings, child. 
How are you?
[1056.04] I am fine.
[1058.24] Child, your mother longs 
to talk to you.
[1066.96] Here, talk to her.
[1077.88] How are you child?
[1080.36] I am fine,
[1083.40] and you?
[1086.64] You should have met me 
and asked me this.
[1095.12] Do you have any idea
[1097.92] how much your mother is waiting for you?
[1104.28] I am coming.
[1111.52] After all, asking how an ill person 
is a good deed.
[1120.60] I will come with this relation.
[1148.20] Master,
[1150.68] the matter is something else,
[1155.64] or else my Arooj cannot talk to me 
like this, like a stranger.
[1165.36] I hadn’t even thought of this.
[1214.56] It is so weird,
[1222.72] the relation with which 
I spent my entire life,
[1232.92] that turned to be just an acquaintance.
[1253.60] Child, your mother longs to talk to you.
[1269.64] Do you have any idea
[1272.20] how much your mother is waiting for you?
[1342.16] Arooj.
[1348.24] Did you call me so far here,
in an emergency,
[1350.60] to hear your silence?
[1359.28] Speak up, what happened to you?
[1364.68] I have nothing left to say.
[1369.60] This never happens that 
you never have words to speak.
[1373.00] Go ahead.
[1375.12] If your words don’t support you 
to say what you want,
[1380.44] then what you do?
[1385.12] Arooj, you don’t seem fine 
to me today,
[1388.56] you don’t seem like the Arooj 
from earlier to me.
[1393.64] You are right.
[1401.48] I am really not the same Arooj 
has earlier,
[1405.52] maybe that Arooj is lost.
[1408.68] Not you are scaring me Arooj.
[1412.20] Look,
[1416.96] if you have a worry in your heart, 
then tell me.
[1421.08] Keeping it in your heart like this,
[1422.92] you will get worried further. 
Speak up.
[1439.32] If you ever find out that
[1442.84] your parents are not 
your real parents,
[1450.88] you are not their daughter,
[1454.60] then what will you do?
[1457.40] What are you saying?
[1460.92] This only happens in dramas,
[1463.52] this doesn’t happen in real life.
[1469.08] It has happened.
[1475.56] This has happened.
[1479.04] With whom?
[1491.16] With me.
[1493.76] This happened with me.
[1512.52] Shanzay my parents are not 
my real parents.
[1516.60] I am not their daughter.
[1518.92] What are you saying?
[1520.72] Did uncle and aunty tell you 
this themselves?
[1533.72] No.
[1536.80] They would never have told me this,
themselves.
[1541.20] Both of them love me so much.
[1548.04] And if they had to tell me this, 
then maybe,
[1551.80] they would have told me this 
a long time back.
[1554.44] Then Arooj, how did you find out
all this yourself?
[1571.84] I went home,
[1576.48] so mama and papa were talking
to each other,
[1580.32] and I heard it all.
[1649.68] Arooj,
[1651.08] if you get free from your father’s advice,
[1655.80] then give some time to your mother too.
[1659.44] This is good
[1661.08] that mother’s wait and 
make arrangements,
[1664.16] and when the daughter comes then 
the family shows their right on them.
[1667.08] Hey, see, I have come to my mother.
[1669.96] I get it all. I understand it all, 
Naseema.
[1673.40] You are turning my daughter against me, 
that too in front of me.
[1679.00] Can I also take some time,
 if you don’t mind.
[1683.48] Take it. Take it.
[1685.56] Come on, come.
[1717.40] Master, this is the grocery list, bring it.
[1723.64] Thank God, Arooj’s mood got fine.
[1727.60] How do you know?
[1729.16] I am saying it because 
she agreed to come over.
[1734.24] Okay,
[1735.52] you can make your guesses.
[1738.68] We will find out when she comes.
[1742.92] Daughters getting upset.
[1744.92] You know she used to get upset
 on small things
[1748.84] and then she would agree herself.
[1751.80] Okay, you quickly get these groceries 
and yes,
[1755.72] bring it from the place our daughter 
Arooj likes it.
[1759.24] Yes, yes, I will bring it from there.
[1761.60] Okay? I will just come.
[1799.16] Man, Arooj,
[1800.56] I want to console you but
[1803.80] I don’t understand what do I say 
that will bring peace to your heart.
[1812.76] Maybe now no word can 
console my heart.
[1820.56] You are my friend.
[1823.64] That is why I told you 
what is in my heart.
[1829.20] Now I feel that
[1832.08] I only have darkness in my life.
[1835.44] My love, don’t say that.
[1837.52] You will see, one day 
everything will be fine,
[1840.16] and there will also be light.
[1846.96] Yes? Don’t worry.
[1849.88] You take care of yourself.
[1851.72] You too. 
Goodbye.
[1853.92] Goodbye.
[1894.60] Loves makes a person fearless 
and brave.
[1898.84] Your mother has a small heart,
[1902.52] and also the mind…
[1905.72] Yes, yes only you are the smart one here,
master.
[1910.44] Mama, papa is taunting you.
[1916.64] Hey yes, I have a news. 
I forgot to tell you.
[1920.32] I have an interview call tomorrow.
[1922.24] Oh wow, from where?
[1924.64] In a multinational company. 
It is a really good opportunity, papa.
[1928.84] My daughter will surely 
be successful.
[1932.92] Once I get this job,
[1935.20] then all of us will go on 
an international trip.
[1938.44] Oh wow.
[1944.40] How do relations suddenly change into
an acquaintance within a moment.
[1954.80] You can have an acquaintance 
with anyone.
[1960.16] It is the relation that is important,
[1965.28] that is not broken even when you are not
together or your hands aren’t holding each other.
[1970.20] I have such a relation somewhere.
[1975.92] Who do I make my own?
[1979.76] I have become a stranger.
[1982.20] I have become no one.
[1987.32] Now the pain has increased.
[1991.52] I wish I had not heard all this.
[2017.48] But there are certain things,
[2021.76] that cannot even be resolved, 
even after being cleared.
[2024.52] This means, there is something. 
Right?
[2028.96] Yes.
[2031.44] There is always something 
in everything.
[2037.16] The only difference is that
[2039.76] at times that thing weighs more, 
at times it weighs less.
[2046.36] Fine, I got it.
[2047.96] You don’t want to tell me.
[2051.20] You don’t consider me your own.
[2057.60] The ones who I considered 
my own, they…
[2081.36] Greetings.
[2083.28] Greetings.
[2086.36] Did you talk to Arooj? 
Did she tell you something?
[2092.92] No, she didn’t tell me anything,
[2096.68] but I have guessed myself.
[2108.12] What guess?
[2112.20] That there is surely some issue 
between the mother and daughter.
[2119.32] But how can there be an issue?
[2124.68] Those two are really attached.
[2129.52] I too have just guessed.
[2135.84] I have sent Arooj to go 
and meet her parents.
[2139.68] When she comes back, then 
we will find out what the issue is.
[2145.28] I hope this matter resolves soon.
[2152.60] Don’t worry. Go and get fresh.
[2199.60] Naseema, what is the matter?
[2202.52] Why are you worried?
[2205.40] Master, why has my Arooj 
not come till now?
[2209.72] Now you start imaging
[2211.80] that Arooj is not coming.
[2213.88] When she has said she will come, 
she will surely come.
[2217.52] My heart is really weird. 
I feel that I am waiting for a guest.
[2223.76] When daughters get married, 
they come like guests.
[2227.68] They stay for a while and leave.
[2230.32] So, she should come at least.
[2234.32] There, our Arooj is here.
[2236.80] Arooj.
[2244.64] Arooj,
[2246.16] what happened, child?
