[28.32] Look Mehreen,
[29.76] I have brought Arooj’s matter to you 
for the last time.
[33.68] Because I have had enough.
[35.44] I cannot see the destruction of this home,
 and Salman’s worry.
[40.08] Okay brother Idrees, 
you please sit comfortably.
[42.76] We will sit and talk.
[47.12] What can I say to you?
[49.52] What do I say about 
my son’s stupidity?
[51.92] Salman had decided to be ruined 
that day
[55.08] when he decided to make a girl 
like Arooj has his wife.
[59.24] Mehreen, when you know everything, 
when you agree to everything, then?
[62.16] I don’t know what family this girl is from, 
what sort of blood she have,
[65.24] or else the children of good parents 
don’t behave this way at all.
[68.60] Arooj’s intention is just to
 get Salman’s wealth,
[71.12] and to reach it, 
she is making moves.
[74.84] I am tired of this Arooj, 
but what do I do about Salman?
[79.64] Salman is obedient to you.
[81.28] If you order him to do something,
[82.88] it is not possible that 
he will not obey it.
[86.76] And if you ask me honestly, Mehreen,
[88.72] then Waqar’s face comes 
in front of my eyes.
[94.12] Like he is telling me that brother,
[97.56] after I died
[99.40] you couldn’t save my wife and 
my son, Salman, from sorrow.
[103.52] My heart starts to explode.
[120.16] Ammad, I don’t understand 
what I should do.
[123.08] Arooj, what is there not 
to understand in this?
[126.56] Your marriage is on the line 
because of this situation
[132.04] and you still are thinking ten times 
before deciding.
[135.20] Come on, man.
[136.44] I don’t understand Ammad,
[138.32] that are we facing a bigger loss 
hiding this,
[141.28] or will we face a bigger loss 
by telling this.
[143.00] Of course hiding it.
[145.36] Your life has been ruined a lot, 
even though you have no fault in this.
[149.72] It is the fault of that Mr. Idrees,
[151.36] who got married and hid it.
[156.52] Who pointed fingers at your life,
[159.28] and distanced you from Salman.
[164.52] And you are having a hard time 
decided against him?
[167.48] Can I ask you what this difficulty is?
[170.44] There is a difficulty, Ammad.
[172.36] It is difficult.
[175.48] When you have to save your home
from a storm,
[177.84] then you face a lot of difficulties.
[181.28] Uncle is the elder of this home,
[183.52] his respect will be tarnished, 
that is the difficulty.
[188.28] Aunt loves me so much,
[191.48] she will have nothing left. 
That is the difficulty.
[194.44] And Salman?
[197.48] He will lose his faith from 
the entire family.
[202.72] That’s the difficulty. 
He will break
[206.20] and I love him a lot.
[208.48] I will not be able to see him like this.
[210.92] Fine,
[212.72] when you know everything, 
then why are you asking me?
[216.56] Then whose advice should I take?
[221.16] And you want that I become selfish,
[226.32] maybe I will never be able to become that.
I am sorry.
[232.00] Arooj.
[263.12] Arooj, you know Salman doesn’t like 
you meeting Ammad.
[269.00] Then why do you meet him?
[272.76] Why should I not meet him?
[275.32] I have nothing to hide, aunt.
[278.16] You are right.
[279.56] But child, your life cannot 
pass like this.
[282.88] I don’t even want to pass life like this,
[286.52] I want to live my life.
[290.32] How will you live happily?
[292.20] How will you live,
[293.64] when your life partner is not happy?
[306.96] Brother Idrees, please get 
a grip on yourself.
[310.12] You will get unwell this way.
[312.48] Here, the respect of the home 
is getting tarnished.
[314.44] You leave my health, think about 
the respect of the home.
[316.60] You know everything Mehreen.
[319.04] You will say
[320.84] that Arooj is the root of this entire issue?
[323.28] So why don’t you cut this root?
[326.08] Bring peace in Salman’s life, 
tell him to get rid of Arooj.
[333.08] If the mother in law had this right,
[335.04] then I would have made this decision 
a long time back.
[336.88] But Salman has to make this decision.
[339.84] Mehreen, we will have to think 
beyond ifs and buts.
[343.24] Force him to make the decision.
[346.08] Now do you need any more proof 
after seeing that picture?
[349.64] If you cannot make him decide, 
then tell me,
[352.08] I will talk to him strictly.
[353.68] How long will be tolerate 
Arooj’s stubbornness?
[357.20] I cannot see his condition. My child,
my heart worries seeing him.
[361.96] No, no, brother Idrees, 
you won’t talk to Salman.
[365.04] He is my son, I will talk to him.
[367.24] I will make him understand.
[368.96] But please, you get a grip 
on yourself.
[371.08] I will just come. 
You please…
[383.44] Arooj.
[385.24] Arooj.
[386.68] If it was in my control, 
I would kill this girl.
[391.12] She ruined the environment 
of our home.
[398.76] Enough.
[431.24] What sort of a woman is this Mehreen?
[433.52] She is not talking herself
[438.32] and neither is she letting me talk.
[442.88] I have to explain everything to her 
from the start and push her.
[450.48] She gets angry and says that
[455.48] I will do this, I will do that,
[460.12] and when the time to decide comes,
[464.80] she says no.
[468.24] Whatever is to be done, 
will be done by Salman.
[507.68] What are you looking at, aunt?
[512.08] This is a picture of our wedding 
anniversary.
[519.08] See,
[521.20] your uncle is even handsome today.
[531.28] I love him to bits.
[540.16] But child,
[542.72] I am worried for you.
[545.36] If I tell you honestly,
[548.12] if I don’t speak to your uncle,
[550.80] and even an hour passes, 
then I don’t find peace.
[558.04] You love uncle so much?
[561.56] The truth is, Idrees really loves me.
[576.52] I shouldn’t tell anything to aunt.
[581.88] Her heart will break.
[592.40] What are you thinking, child?
[601.00] I am proud of your love,
[606.80] that you love uncle so much.
[687.64] Why did you come to my room?
[690.64] Wont you ask me to sit, today?
[693.64] Talk about whatever you want 
to quickly, I am busy.
[697.76] Okay fine,
[699.56] I will increase your work a little more.
[708.32] Check this file.
[709.80] What is in this file?
[711.80] See for yourself.
[718.04] Okay, I will tell you.
[723.60] Corruption of ten million 
in Sasa builder project.
[727.96] Wow.
[732.92] Five million commission in 
Multinational Advertising.
[737.12] Very nice.
[742.44] And the weirdest corruption 
that I didn’t understand.
[746.84] Maybe you can help me in this.
[752.96] Stone bury marble
[755.56] costed sixty four hundred thousand,
[763.52] but that is not the important thing.
[765.80] The important thing is 
where that marble went?
[773.96] There is no record, no data,
[777.84] where did that marble go?
[789.92] I feel your heart is sinking.
[805.88] Will you still not ask me to sit?
[816.20] Have a seat.
[819.76] Thank you.
[865.04] It is ringing, but Idrees is not
 answering the call.
[870.04] God be kind.
[873.20] Madam,
[874.96] it is possible elder sir is busy 
somewhere.
[879.72] It is really late, now Wasai.
[882.24] What is he busy with?
[884.28] He can send a two word message.
[887.72] madam, he must have a lot of work
 in the office.
[894.48] No, no,
[896.72] it is ringing constantly,
[899.08] but Idrees is not answering his phone.
[903.08] It is not possible that
[905.32] Idrees wouldn’t know I am calling.
[912.28] Idrees, answer the phone.
[917.40] My heart is so worried.
[919.84] Why is he not answering my phone?
[923.32] No, no, madam,
[925.36] you don’t worry.
[927.56] God will make it all fine.
[931.56] Yes, fine, you leave.
[934.16] Leave me alone.
[937.92] Sure, madam.
[942.80] Why is he not attending the call?
[945.08] Idrees answer the phone.
[947.32] He is not answering my message?
[950.40] Where are you Idrees?
[953.16] Why are you not picking up my phone?
[955.36] Answer me.
[977.12] Idrees has made my life hell.
[985.28] Answer the phone Idrees.
[986.92] Mama, I want a burger, 
I am hungry.
[990.12] From where do I order it from? 
I don’t have money.
[992.48] Then you call, papa.
[994.12] I was calling him, he is not answering.
[996.20] Call him again.
[997.88] I want to have a burger and that’s it.
[1035.40] Answer the phone, uncle.
[1038.24] It feels like you are getting 
a call from two places.
[1042.80] I will answer it, it is my issue.
[1046.56] By the way,
[1048.76] you have two numbers, right?
[1051.88] No,
[1053.28] I have just one number.
[1055.36] Oh,
[1057.00] there must be a lot of confusion then.
[1062.44] When the first one calls, you must 
take the name of the second
[1066.04] and when the second calls you, 
you would take the name of the first.
[1083.12] What do you want?
[1089.40] You are really worried 
by my questions.
[1097.28] I am surprised.
[1099.76] The one who answers 
the whole world has
[1103.72] no answer for me today.
[1108.84] I know what you know.
[1111.64] But now I want to know 
what you want from me.
[1133.92] Deal.
[1136.92] What sort of deal?
[1138.68] You will do what I tell you to do.
[1146.12] What will you say? 
And what will I have to do?
[1149.72] Good,
[1151.32] meaning you are ready 
for the deal.
[1154.08] If I say no, then?
[1160.16] You don’t have the option to say no.
[1162.88] Think about it, it is up to you.
[1165.96] What have I done to you?
[1171.36] You have done a lot to me.
[1178.16] And you know what you have 
done calls for revenge.
[1195.16] Now you will take revenge 
from me?
[1199.08] Nope.
[1205.24] I leave that on you too.
[1211.64] If you agree to me, then that’s it.
[1224.72] Then you won’t take revenge?
[1227.88] Nice,
[1229.76] your statement has your 
acceptance of crime.
[1233.04] Answer me.
[1269.84] If you agree to me,
[1274.12] then I will tell the revenge to…
[1323.04] Hello.
[1324.44] This is Mrs. Idrees.
[1326.44] Yes, madam.
[1328.32] Is Mr. Idrees in the office?
[1330.12] Yes, he is in the office.
[1332.76] Is he really busy.
[1334.32] No madam, I don’t know about this
[1336.56] but right now Mr. Idrees is in a meeting
with madam Arooj.
[1340.40] Arooj has come?
[1341.68] Yes, madam, if you have a message,
then you tell me. I will give it to sir.
[1346.52] No. No. I will call him myself.
[1350.92] Thanks.
[1351.92] Okay madam, thank you.
[1360.52] What is Arooj doing in Idrees’ office.
[1374.80] What happened, Muqadas? 
Who was on the phone?
[1377.28] Sir Idrees’ wife called.
[1380.56] So? What was she saying?
[1382.96] Man, I felt she was taking a confirmation.
[1386.56] Hmm.
[1388.32] Leave it man, big people, big talks. 
You are right.
[1391.32] You give this file to the accounts. 
Sure, don’t worry.
[1449.56] Madam Arooj is here at this hour.
[1453.68] There is no meeting in the 
meeting calendar either.
[1458.64] She also has a file in her hand.
[1461.16] What did she come here for?
[1483.16] Is Mr. Idrees in the office?
[1485.04] Yes, he is in the office.
[1487.68] Is he really busy.
[1489.24] No madam, I don’t know about this
[1491.64] but right now Mr. Idrees is in a 
meeting with madam Arooj.
[1495.40] Arooj has come?
[1496.56] Yes, madam, if you have a message, 
then you tell me. I will give it to sir.
[1520.40] Idrees doesn’t even like hearing 
Arooj’s name,
[1530.84] then why did Arooj go to meet 
Idrees in his office.
[1544.72] If there was something, they could have
also talked about it at home.
[1557.48] Arooj is hiding something from me.
[1567.24] But Arooj doesn’t hide anything 
from me.
[1577.80] It is possible she doesn’t want 
Mehreen finding out.
[1589.56] Whatever it is,
[1593.84] it is really shocking for Idrees.
[1601.20] That is why he is not answering
 my phone.
[1645.64] You will do what I tell you to do.
[1653.16] What will you say? 
And what will I have to do?
[1656.72] Good,
[1658.56] meaning you are ready for the deal.
[1661.04] If I say no, then?
[1667.20] You don’t have the option to say no.
[1669.92] Think about it, it is up to you.
[1697.08] You have done a lot to me.
[1703.92] And you know what you have 
done calls for revenge.
[1732.28] Arooj, you? Here? In this office?
[1736.80] Is everything okay?
[1739.36] Why?
[1741.00] Do I need your permission 
to come to the office?
[1743.64] Yes,
[1745.28] you should.
[1749.76] But anyway, if you are here, 
then tell me, what is the matter?
[1753.72] Have a seat.
[1759.40] I...
[1764.12] I want to share an important file 
with you.
[1769.00] What file? Show me.
[1770.48] But first listen to me.
[1775.12] What is it? Tell me.
[1778.32] Whatever is in this file,
[1781.00] you will accept it as it is
[1785.08] and you will not ask any question 
in this regards.
[1789.88] Anything else?
[1791.92] and you will not say no 
about anything to me.
[1795.84] Arooj, I am the CEO of this company,
[1799.08] all decisions here are made under me.
[1803.16] I know.
[1808.68] I am making a special request to you.
[1812.44] Okay, show me the file. 
Let me see.
[1860.24] Now you listen to me carefully.
[1864.08] I want to talk to you about aunt.
[1867.28] Aunt Shaista.
[1871.48] She really loves you.
[1877.04] For her sake,
[1878.92] I will let this secret remain a secret.
[1891.56] Second thing,
[1895.16] Salman.
[1901.32] You will not make Salman face 
any sort of financial loss
[1913.80] and I am doing this for Salman 
and not for you.
[1924.28] Because he really respects you.
[1932.60] I hope you will be obedient to this.
[1942.16] Or else, I have all the proof with me.
[1984.48] What are you thinking?
Huh?
[1990.08] Nothing at all.
[1992.24] Okay tell me something,
[1994.32] what is the reason for blessing 
uncle so much.
[2005.80] What did he do?
[2008.08] You have promised me Salman
[2010.96] that you will not ask me 
any questions.
[2014.32] Okay fine, I won’t ask.
[2055.24] Here you go.
[2059.96] Thank you.
[2061.40] You are welcome.
[2080.28] What sort of a girl is she?
[2087.56] Uncle is against her and
[2094.72] she came to get his salary increased.
[2101.64] Arooj,
[2107.96] it is so difficult to make a 
decision against you.
[2148.36] Now you will take revenge from me?
[2153.08] I leave that on you too.
[2157.36] If you agree to me, then that’s it.
[2163.12] Then you won’t take revenge?
[2166.16] Nice,
[2168.16] your statement has your 
acceptance of crime.
[2180.84] Sir, I knew madam Arooj came 
suddenly,
[2183.52] there must be something special.
[2185.28] What is special?
[2187.48] What did you find out?
[2189.28] I just found out,
[2192.48] and you know everything 
got done well.
[2194.48] I was not even mentioned.
[2196.84] Nawaz, what happened now?
[2200.20] Your salary has increased, boss.
[2203.52] Salary increased, meaning?
[2205.64] Madam Arooj, asked Mr. Salman 
and had your salary increased.
[2214.08] You know sir, this calls for lunch 
for the entire staff on this.
[2218.76] Okay fine,
[2220.76] don’t become a pain all the time.
Go, right now. Leave.
[2223.76] Okay, sir.
[2239.64] Arooj started working 
on the deal so soon.
