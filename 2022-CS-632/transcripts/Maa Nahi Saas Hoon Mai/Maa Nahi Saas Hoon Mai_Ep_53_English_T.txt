[33.24] Naseema, what is the matter?
[36.12] Why are you worried?
[38.96] Master, why has my Arooj 
not come till now?
[43.28] Now you start imaging
[45.36] that Arooj is not coming.
[47.60] When she has said she will come, 
she will surely come.
[51.32] My heart is really weird. 
I feel that
[53.92] I am waiting for a guest.
[57.40] When daughters get married, 
they come like guests.
[61.36] They stay for a while and leave.
[64.04] So, she should come at least.
[67.80] There, our Arooj is here.
[70.44] Arooj.
[78.24] Arooj, what happened, child?
[82.92] Is everything fine?
[85.52] You are fine, right?
[88.60] Did Mehreen say something?
[90.92] Did you fight with Salman?
[98.76] What happened, child? 
What happened?
[103.20] Papa…
[106.48] What happened?
[109.40] Okay come on, come inside. 
Come inside.
[113.44] No issues, child. What happened? 
Tell us.
[116.76] Come on. Come on.
[154.40] What is the issue, Arooj, child?
[158.52] Will you continue to cry
[160.88] or will you tell us something, as well?
[173.68] Today, I don’t have to tell you anything.
[178.64] I have to ask.
[191.32] Why did you two hide such 
a big truth from me?
[201.72] What truth?
[225.52] That I am not the daughter 
of both of you.
[276.12] The silence of both of you tells me
[279.64] that whatever I heard from both of you
that day is true.
[294.88] Why did you do this? Tell me.
[299.08] How could we tell you, child?
[304.88] We had forgotten ourselves that 
you are not our daughter.
[307.76] You are lying.
[309.88] Lies!
[313.64] I wish you had forgotten this,
[323.16] then it wouldn’t have reached me.
[326.12] But now it has reached me.
[333.56] You have found out now,
[337.32] so tell me,
[339.88] are you not our daughter?
[353.68] Arooj,
[356.88] will you not call me ‘mama’ now?
[360.60] I cannot even think that.
[363.44] You are my mama, 
and you are my papa.
[367.32] Yes,
[368.60] we are your parents.
[379.04] Then,
[380.48] what are you sad about?
[395.80] I am just sad about being separated 
from unseen relations.
[408.04] Where are you going?
[413.60] I am going to find out, 
who am I?
[418.08] whose daughter am I? 
Who gave birth to me?
[424.36] Who separated me from my parents?
[426.68] What is my identity? 
Who am I?
[438.52] I am going to find the answers 
for all these questions.
[444.36] Stop her. Master, 
you please go stop her.
[447.36] Where will she go? 
Where will she find her parents?
[451.08] We couldn’t find her parents then,
[455.84] now twenty-five years have passed.
[540.00] Naseema, you were right.
[541.84] I found a child.
[543.20] See, I had told you I could hear 
some child cry.
[546.76] Why did you find this child from?
[548.12] Hey, they were lying in the branches.
[550.68] In the branches?
[552.24] Master, what sort of parents are these?
[554.96] Master, what will we do with this child?
[557.76] We will go to the police station,
[559.68] we will handover this child to them.
[561.80] No, no, first we will take them home.
[564.08] God know how long they would be
 hungry for.
[566.80] Yes, you are right.
[568.32] See, how they became quiet 
coming in my arms.
[620.40] My child,
[622.20] people become enemies.
[624.68] Tell me, why are you jumping in a fire 
started by someone else?
[628.84] Mama, you can also put out the fire.
[632.12] Okay, you go and change your clothes.
[634.88] I will go make a cold drink for you.
[637.16] And yes, today I am making my doll’s 
favourite biryani today.
[643.20] Oh wow, it will be a lot of fun then.
[645.72] Where is papa?
I don’t see him.
[648.60] He went out for some work, 
he said he will come late.
[666.36] You are your own enemy.
[668.60] My son, Salman, a big man made you
 part of his life and you…
[674.04] you showed him your true colours.
[677.80] True colours?
[680.16] Really?
[681.60] What true colours did I show?
[683.44] I should also find out.
[686.44] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything.
[688.76] One cannot talk to a girl like you.
[691.24] In fact, their mothers are cursed,
[693.12] who have given birth to girls like you.
[695.00] Don’t say anything about my mother.
[699.28] That’s why I am saying that 
I don’t want to say anything.
[702.96] Because it is girls like you
[704.80] who give people the opportunity 
to point fingers at their mothers.
[707.44] Go from here, now. Leave.
[768.88] Arooj, tea.
[778.08] You seem to be in a big shock to me.
[782.80] Yes,
[785.84] the shock is really big.
[790.04] Arooj, your parent’s shock is way bigger
 than your shock.
[799.00] You have stepped out to search 
for your real parents,
[802.56] they have lost their daughter.
[807.00] I have no complaints from them.
[812.76] I am still their daughter.
[814.60] You were their daughter
[817.36] till the time you didn’t know the difference
 between your own and strangers.
[824.48] But I have no complaints from them.
[827.60] They are my well-wishers.
[830.68] But I don’t know
[832.84] I have a weird confusion in my heart.
[835.84] What confusion, Arooj?
[841.24] On one hand this heart is stuck 
in the love of my mama and papa,
[850.80] and on the other hand
[853.52] the shock of being separated from 
my real parents is not leaving this heart.
[862.16] Look, I agree with you,
[864.76] but what can you do?
[869.64] I will find my parents.
[873.32] Arooj, how will you find your parents?
[878.40] I don’t understand this,
[881.80] that from where do I start 
the journey of this search.
[891.68] I think
[893.96] first you should talk to your parents 
about your past.
[902.76] That’s only when you can find out.
[979.28] Hello.
[982.00] Arooj, you are really brave. 
You are really consistent.
[986.48] You will have to get a grip 
on yourself bravely.
[989.92] Yes, I am trying.
[992.84] Arooj, I have only seen this in films.
[996.04] Look, none of us has any experience.
[999.40] But still as your friend,
[1002.56] I can only encourage you.
[1006.08] Thank you,
[1007.48] but no one’s words give me peace now,
[1012.76] and now nothing anyone says 
can heal my heart.
[1017.16] Arooj,
[1019.12] those whose parents die in childhood,
[1021.36] they tolerate the injustice of 
their step relations.
[1024.52] You have been brought up 
with a lot of love.
[1026.60] The biggest sorrow is that
[1028.84] I don’t know who my real relations are,
[1034.44] where are they
[1036.28] and I have to find them.
[1038.52] Anyway, I am always with you.
[1041.20] Whenever you need me, 
please, let me know.
[1045.36] Just pray for me.
[1047.44] Take care of yourself. Goodbye.
[1052.08] Goodbye.
[1112.12] Why did you two hide such 
a big truth from me?
[1118.80] What truth?
[1121.76] The silence of both of you tells me that
[1124.92] whatever I heard from both of you 
that day is true.
[1132.60] Why did you do this? Tell me.
[1136.72] How could we tell you, child?
[1141.36] We had forgotten ourselves that 
you are not our daughter.
[1144.00] You are lying.
[1146.28] Lies!
[1150.08] I wish you had forgotten this,
[1153.92] then it wouldn’t have reached me.
[1156.80] But now it has reached me.
[1174.32] What are you thinking, Master?
[1193.72] I am thinking, Naseema,
[1197.12] how relations change in moments.
[1203.84] I too feel the same way
[1206.84] that we are left with nothing.
[1210.52] Don’t say that.
[1216.40] Arooj will never leave us and go.
[1220.04] Even if she finds her parents.
[1237.96] Now what are you thinking?
[1241.28] I am thinking
[1243.28] that if Arooj’s mother in law, Mehreen, 
finds out about all this,
[1248.44] then she will make her life hell.
Master.
[1255.36] You are right.
[1263.32] This way, Arooj’s position 
will be questioned.
[1269.44] Okay,
[1270.68] then you do one thing,
 you call Arooj.
[1312.88] Hello. 
Hello.
[1315.32] Yes, mama?
[1317.20] Child I wanted to give you an advice.
[1321.32] Go ahead.
[1323.36] Don’t let anyone in your in-laws find out
 about all this.
[1330.44] What if you have to face more difficulties.
[1337.60] Yes, better.
[1339.40] Okay, take care of yourself. 
Goodbye.
[1343.16] Goodbye.
[1352.96] You have your tea.
[1365.92] Salman.
[1368.12] Yes, mom?
[1369.80] Do you know where Arooj went?
[1372.72] Yes, she went to her parent’s home.
[1375.96] Why don’t you say she went 
to her mother’s home?
[1379.72] It is the same thing, mom.
[1381.20] It is not the same thing.
[1385.96] The mothers of such girls 
are really cunning.
[1388.80] They turn them against their in-laws
[1391.16] and Naseema is one of them.
[1394.36] I feel those two have some problems
 with each other.
[1399.32] Arooj is upset with her mother.
[1403.40] Really?
[1405.28] If this is true, then it is really good.
[1412.24] But this is not true.
[1417.64] Because this is some move of this girl
to keep us in the dark.
[1423.20] What move can it be?
[1428.00] There must simply be some differences 
between the mother and daughter.
[1431.56] You should have an idea now.
[1434.20] The girl who can have differences
with her real mother,
[1437.36] she can be upset with her,
[1439.12] what sort of behavior will she have 
with your mother.
[1444.44] Mom, I don’t think the way you think.
[1458.40] You are back.
[1469.80] Did you make truce with your mother?
[1476.64] Or did you call her mad too?
[1500.96] Did you see, Salman
[1503.16] how she ignored your mother and 
didn’t reply to anything she said.
[1508.80] Is this girl upset with her mother 
or is she upset with the entire world?
[1529.44] In this home, the youngsters 
are becoming the elder.
[1531.68] I don’t understand this.
[1585.20] Why did you not answer mom?
[1590.60] Is it necessary to answer everything?
[1594.76] Yes, but still…
[1597.20] What still, Salman?
[1604.20] Aunty anyway says a lot,
[1607.64] and I never get upset on 
anything she says.
[1613.04] Being upset reminds me, you were 
upset with your mother?
[1619.24] There is nothing like that.
[1621.32] There was something, Arooj.
[1624.92] Why do you get after one thing?
[1627.56] Because your behavior is extra ordinary.
[1634.12] You have never done this till today, 
do I not know you?
[1636.56] So what do you know?
[1642.04] You don’t know anything.
[1645.96] This means there is something 
that I don’t know.
[1649.68] Hah,
[1652.12] if you find out something,
then do tell me too.
[1656.88] I am searching for it.
[1659.08] In fact, I am the one who is at 
the greatest loss in this.
[1669.40] How is that?
[1671.92] My Arooj has gotten lost somewhere 
in this queue of questions.
[1706.52] I don’t know,
[1710.68] has she gotten lost or
[1715.32] was she lost?
[1776.88] Do you know where Arooj went?
[1779.64] Yes, she went to her parent’s home.
[1782.92] Why don’t you say she went 
to her mother’s home?
[1786.80] It is the same thing, mom.
[1788.28] It is not the same thing.
[1791.84] The mothers of such girls 
are really cunning.
[1794.56] They turn them against their in-laws
[1796.96] and Naseema is one of them.
[1800.16] I feel those two have some 
problems with each other.
[1805.12] Arooj is upset with her mother.
[1809.24] Really?
[1811.20] If this is true, then it is really good.
[1814.68] But this is not true.
[1817.16] Because this is some move of this girl
 to keep us in the dark.
[1822.60] What move can it be?
[1825.32] There must simply be some differences
between the mother and daughter.
[1836.08] This Arooj is trying to act really smart.
[1843.72] She is hiding something.
[1851.24] A person hides the thing
[1858.04] that is a cause of embarrassment 
for them.
[1863.96] I will find out
[1869.48] what is going on between Arooj 
and her mother.
[1877.88] You are really deep, Arooj.
[1884.00] But my name is also Mehreen.
[1888.64] You will tell me yourself.
[1896.16] Wasai.
[1901.04] Yes, elder madam?
[1903.92] You go around madam Arooj a lot.
[1909.20] No, elder madam.
[1911.32] You are mistaken.
[1917.48] I serve everyone.
[1921.84] Hmmm.
[1923.68] By the way, Wasai,
[1925.24] who does madam Arooj talk to 
on the phone
[1931.84] and what does she talk about?
[1934.60] You must have heard it some time.
[1937.48] No, no, I never heard anything.
[1941.04] Hmmm.
[1942.20] Okay.
[1943.96] But you must know what Mr. Salman 
and madam Arooj talk about.
[1954.52] What do they talk about?
[1957.08] Madam, we are servants,
[1961.16] our eyes and ears are closed.
[1966.80] Okay, okay, fine.
[1968.36] Don’t talk too much and 
go from here.
[2013.64] I wish you had forgotten this,
[2019.04] then it wouldn’t have reached me.
[2021.92] But now it has reached me.
[2026.88] You have found out now,
[2030.80] so tell me,
[2033.24] are you not our daughter?
[2038.24] Arooj,
[2041.56] will you not call me ‘mama’ now?
[2045.28] I cannot even think that.
[2048.20] You are my mama, 
and you are my papa.
[2051.68] Yes, we are your parents.
[2055.80] Then, what are you sad about?
[2066.52] You seem to be in a big shock to me.
[2069.52] Yes, the shock is really big.
[2073.68] Arooj, your parents’ shock is 
way bigger than your shock.
[2080.44] You have stepped out to search 
for your real parents,
[2084.12] they have lost their daughter.
[2088.44] I have no complaints from them.
[2093.20] I am still their daughter.
[2095.12] You were their daughter
[2097.96] till the time you didn’t know the difference
between your own and strangers.
[2110.28] Mother.
[2116.12] My mother.
[2120.80] Where are you?
[2133.64] Where do I look for you?
[2141.96] How do I find you?
[2156.08] I want to meet you.
[2166.72] I just want to meet you once.
[2182.92] How do I cover the journey
of so many years?
[2188.60] That too in reverse.
[2196.00] Mama, you know
[2201.80] it is really difficult to walk in reverse.
[2209.24] Once.
[2213.88] Come in front of me just once.
[2225.28] My heart wants that I open my eyes,
[2232.96] and you suddenly come 
in front of me.
[2246.96] Arooj.
[2255.12] You are crying secretly?
