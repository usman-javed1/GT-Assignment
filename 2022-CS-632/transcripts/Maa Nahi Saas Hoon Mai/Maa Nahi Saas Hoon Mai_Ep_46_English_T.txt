[20.56] Thank your mother for tea.
[22.56] Yes, I will surely.
By the way,
[29.80] you didn’t answer my question.
[34.68] You didn’t hear the answer
you came here for
[42.00] or else I have replied to you.
[45.28] No.
[51.36] There is nothing like that.
[53.76] Come,
[55.04] I will take you outside.
[62.92] I know the way,
[65.24] I will go.
[90.56] When someone becomes quiet instead
of admitting something,
[100.40] then he is at a point, where it is
impossible for them to say no.
[108.28] His silence is his answer.
[115.40] Both Arooj and Ammad have
the same style.
[124.48] No justification for anything.
[134.48] Greetings.
[165.88] Greetings mama.
[168.28] Greetings. Live long, child.
[171.48] How are you feeling now?
[173.40] Thank God.
[175.56] See, I got your favourite biscuits
and medicines.
[179.80] Thank you child.
[181.64] You made me a stranger.
[184.80] Do you hear what mama is saying,
Ammad?
[187.20] She is thanking me.
[189.64] How are you?
[191.76] I am fine. How are you?
[193.76] I am fine.
[196.56] By the way, why did Salman
come here?
[202.92] He was asking me
[205.36] when are you getting married?
[208.48] Seriously?
[211.24] You mean such a big businessman
came to ask you this?
[215.56] Yes, I too was surprised.
[220.56] But don’t you worry, very soon,
this puzzle will be solved.
[225.00] It should too.
[227.36] Okay leave it,
[228.64] I will make coffee, then all of us
will sit together and have it.
[232.68] Okay.
[241.48] Come here, son.
Have a seat.
[257.72] Unluckily, you are my mother in law
[262.64] or else I wanted that
you become my mother.
[267.28] If I had a daughter like you,
[269.68] then I would have choked her
to death myself.
[274.00] Mothers don’t choke their daughters.
[277.60] If the daughter has a character like you,
[280.16] who leaves a husband like Salman
and cared for their old friendships,
[285.92] then you ought to kill them.
[300.88] I have done enough,
[303.96] now it is Salman’s turn.
[309.80] And I know my Salman really well.
[314.44] He has gone after Ammad.
[319.76] You pray Arooj,
[322.32] that Salman doesn’t get his
hands on Ammad.
[353.92] Hey,
[356.12] I was just going to call you.
[358.40] Really?
[360.00] You know I was going to call you
for some reason,
[363.08] but why were you going to call me?
[366.84] I just wanted to tell you
[369.24] that Salman left home really angry.
[372.80] Yes, he was angry.
[377.04] How do you know?
[378.56] Because your Romeo
came to my home.
[384.60] He came to ask me why
I am not getting married.
[392.56] He was acting really childish
in front of me.
[396.80] He is a really innocent and
emotional person,
[400.44] he is not childish at all.
[405.88] But I am surprised
why he came to you.
[410.12] Yes, I found it really weird.
[417.00] If I say that I am going to get married,
[420.52] then maybe his thought can be
removed from his wife.
[427.20] Is that all you talked about or…
[428.96] He didn’t talk about anything else,
asking me after asking me, my choice.
[433.68] Maybe he wanted me to say
your name in response.
[445.76] By the way, Arooj,
can I say something?
[451.64] Mr. Salman really loves you.
[456.96] He loves me? Really?
[461.08] Then he came to you to verify.
[464.00] Because love is distrusting, Arooj.
[473.32] Maybe you are right.
[478.88] Anyway, we will talk later.
Goodbye.
[483.24] Goodbye.
[520.00] What is between you and Arooj?
[526.84] Why did you not ask Arooj this?
[530.68] She would have answered it better.
[535.76] You two were class fellows right?
[540.04] Yes, that’s how it is.
[547.28] and I have heard that
[550.80] you used to like Arooj.
[583.68] You have insulted my love, Salman.
[592.12] Till now I used to think that
[598.48] you have been misguided
by people.
[607.36] But you turned out to be
like that yourself.
[614.76] You don’t trust your wife,
[620.52] and…
[625.24] and you are asking others to testify.
[630.20] And you are making the person
you don’t like testifying.
[637.08] Wow, Salman.
[639.68] Is this what love is?
[714.36] I am sure you are having
a hard time talking to me.
[721.24] No issue.
[728.60] You cannot ignore me like this.
[736.00] You will have to talk.
[743.48] You will come home, right?
[786.20] Brother Idrees,
[789.24] I don’t understand you.
[792.96] Mehreen, what did I do that
you don’t understand.
[795.40] Look, I don’t like beating about the push,
whatever I say will be straightforward.
[803.12] If I say it clearly,
[806.40] then you had started the fire.
[811.24] What are you saying?
What else?
[813.96] You are the one who told me
the stories of Ammad and Arooj.
[819.28] When did I see it with my eyes?
[821.24] And when I asked you to testify
in front of Salman yesterday,
[824.16] then you acted like
you didn’t know anything.
[830.04] So,
[831.08] what did you want?
I would have spoken up?
[835.72] How would you speak up,
brother Idrees?
[838.08] That Arooj shut you up
by doubling your salary.
[846.16] Now don’t be surprised brother Idrees,
[848.44] I know everything.
[852.12] That’s not true, Mehreen, I had told
Salman everything about Arooj.
[862.48] I had told him, that Arooj is…is…
[873.32] Meaning, she is such a good girl,
she understands the matters,
[878.08] in fact, she understands a
few matters in depth. Yes.
[883.48] What are the matters in the depth
of which that Arooj can reach,
[887.84] but I have not reached there till now?
[894.36] Actually, the thing is Mehreen,
if I go back in depth,
[898.04] I will not return. That’s the issue.
[901.84] Excuse me,
I have to do some work.
[921.52] They are weird people.
[923.68] I don’t know what is going on
in this home.
[1021.28] You are good at overacting.
[1026.36] Put your phone down.
[1032.16] Because I know no one is more important
in your life than me.
[1047.52] Go ahead,
[1050.24] what do you want to say?
[1058.24] If love need verification,
[1062.08] then it doesn’t remain love.
[1068.48] So, see,
[1074.92] it is being verified.
[1082.88] The sun for the next day hasn’t risen
[1085.64] and he has told you everything.
[1092.68] You are verifying your contact
with him yourself.
[1098.08] This is the biggest flaw of doubt,
[1102.00] that it removes blessings from love.
[1105.68] I went searching for that blessing.
[1109.80] Then?
[1111.56] Did you find it?
[1115.96] I asked him
[1119.88] if he likes Arooj.
[1127.16] He didn’t deny it.
[1133.00] You tell me yourself,
[1135.56] what do I think of this?
[1139.36] Stop assuming things yourself.
[1146.04] I know him well.
[1149.28] He will tell you everything
when the time comes.
[1156.60] You know him really well.
[1162.96] You never thought of knowing me
like this.
[1170.68] You never asked me
about yourself.
[1179.68] But I know you really well.
[1182.76] That is why you are in my life.
[1187.04] Lies, after lies. Lies after lies
and another lie.
[1230.72] Arooj.
[1232.56] What relation do you and Arooj
have with each other?
[1244.80] She is not telling me better,
[1248.24] that is why I am asking you.
[1251.52] Answer me.
[1269.00] Son, Ammad.
[1270.96] Yes, mama. Mama,
[1273.44] come here.
[1275.08] Why did you come?
Son, I was thirsty,
[1277.72] so I thought I would have water.
[1280.32] Okay, you sit here.
I will bring water.
[1294.96] Mama, here you go.
[1300.44] Are you fine?
[1306.32] Give it to me.
[1313.04] Ammad, son,
[1315.52] I am seeing that since
your boss went,
[1318.68] you have become more worried.
[1321.88] I had thought that
your job has resumed.
[1325.52] He came to take you.
[1328.68] Why are you laughing son?
[1331.52] Mama,
[1333.36] you are really naïve.
[1335.88] He didn’t come to take me.
[1339.80] Then? Then why did he come here?
[1343.60] Negative thinking.
[1346.76] What negative thinking?
[1348.84] Mama, leave it.
[1351.36] I don’t want to talk about this topic.
[1354.12] Child, I am your mother,
won’t you tell me?
[1360.52] Mama,
[1362.92] he thinks
[1366.12] I am really close to his wife.
[1370.40] Now, he thinks this.
[1374.72] I know son. I know you.
[1379.04] Who is his wife?
[1381.08] Arooj.
[1384.16] The name is good, but where
and when did you meet her?
[1390.56] Mama, I know Arooj before
she was Mr. Salman’s wife.
[1395.88] Do you remember?
[1397.24] I had told you that I had a really
good friend in university.
[1401.40] That master’s daughter?
[1404.28] Yes, mama.
[1406.08] But Mr. Salman thinks something else,
[1410.64] he doubts Arooj.
[1414.48] Son,
[1416.24] doubts can make matters worse.
[1418.96] You will have to remove his doubt.
[1421.20] Mama, I have tried a lot
to remove his doubt,
[1424.92] but I have not been successful.
[1427.20] Son, try one more time.
[1431.28] This will break your friend’s home.
[1435.08] Her life will be ruined, son.
[1437.76] Yes, mama, I will try.
[1444.16] Fine, then.
[1446.84] If you don’t believe anything I say,
[1454.56] then it is useless to talk on this topic.
[1458.56] Wait.
[1461.84] Sit down.
[1466.80] I want to talk to you.
[1469.64] You don’t want to talk,
you want to ask.
[1475.04] Obviously,
[1477.36] you question a criminal.
[1481.84] Criminal?
[1485.44] I am not even accused,
[1487.36] and you called me a criminal
without investigation.
[1490.88] Wow.
[1492.24] Really?
[1495.40] Fine, then.
We will investigate.
[1500.48] You didn’t like me going there, right?
[1503.28] I didn’t like you going there and
talking about that thing.
[1510.08] It is surprising.
[1513.80] I asked him, he didn’t respond to me.
[1516.52] I am asking you,
you are not responding.
[1518.28] Because what you say is baseless,
[1521.12] there can be no answer for it.
[1523.72] And even if you get the answer,
[1527.00] then will you recommend the
punishment for it yourself or will I do it?
[1533.24] Punishment for me?
And that too, you?
[1538.36] You are not in this position.
[1541.76] I am talking about the punishment
after you get your answer.
[1546.40] The one who mixes doubt with
love should get punished.
[1550.16] You don’t talk about love.
[1556.56] You don’t even know
the meaning of it.
[1568.48] Arooj preference tell you about love.
[1572.72] And I can have any number
on your priority list,
[1576.88] but not the first.
[1582.56] Hmmm.
[1588.92] You have the last number.
[1595.24] Because when the list is made
on the name of one person,
[1599.52] so the first and last number is the same.
[1622.12] You didn’t answer me.
[1624.44] Mr. Salman, believe me
[1627.88] this hot tea is more important
than your question.
[1631.52] Drink it.
[1638.16] And believe me,
[1642.00] Arooj is a good girl.
[1696.44] Arooj, child, pass the butter.
[1704.84] You are not having breakfast?
[1716.88] All okay? Eat something child.
[1720.76] I don’t feel like it, aunt.
[1728.24] Why? What happened?
[1729.88] Why don’t you feel like it?
My heart is not happy.
[1739.08] How can your heart be happy,
[1746.32] after all, the office is no more.
[1759.12] And neither those people
from the office.
[1761.88] What do you say, Salman?
[1782.56] It doesn’t make a difference
if you don’t respond.
[1786.08] It is written clearly on your face.
[1788.56] Mehreen, what is wrong?
[1790.76] Why are you spoiling the mood
of the children early morning?
[1803.64] After all, you have a lot of questions,
[1806.92] and you want the answer for those.
[1809.28] And if you don’t get the answer for it,
you get in a bad mood.
[1813.04] This is not a good thing.
[1817.32] What disobedience are you talking
about sister in law?
[1821.44] Okay leave it.
[1824.16] My issue is that the day doesn’t
start here, but you start.
[1829.40] What day and night are you talking
about sister in law?
[1834.88] Arooj has made my son’s life dark.
[1847.04] You hear it, right?
[1856.88] Will you say something or not?
[1867.36] Look at that, Salman.
Arooj.
[1870.32] She does wrong and act
like nothing is wrong.
[1875.52] What has this girl done to my son?
[1916.12] Happy now?
[1968.56] Punishment for me?
[1970.88] And that too, you?
[1973.72] You are not in this position.
[1977.12] I am talking about the punishment
after you get your answer.
[1981.68] The one who mixes doubt with
love should get punished.
[1985.00] You don’t talk about love.
[1990.12] You don’t even know the meaning of it.
[1995.08] Arooj preference tell you about love.
[1999.32] And I can have any number
on your priority list,
[2003.60] but not the first.
[2039.12] Arooj, child,
[2041.44] get a grip on yourself.
[2047.96] Aunty, I feel
[2054.72] my patience and tolerance
is becoming weak.
[2058.12] Why child?
[2060.36] You have really strong emotions,
and you are a really strong girl?
[2076.80] Whatever is being constantly being
poured in Salman’s ears,
[2081.72] it scares me, aunt.
[2088.00] What fear, child?
[2091.52] That what if he takes me
out of his life?
[2094.36] Hey, have you gone mad, child?
[2095.96] How can he do that?
He can never do that.
[2098.64] He is my…
[2105.04] he respects me a lot, child.
[2110.12] I will not let him do this.
[2114.04] With what right will you stop him?
[2118.72] He only listens to his mother.
[2123.84] That’s the issue,
[2126.40] at times he doesn’t even listen
to his mother.
[2130.56] He only listens to aunt Mehreen.
[2134.12] What will Mehreen lose?
[2136.40] She will start the fire and step aside.
[2143.68] You and Salman will have to suffer.
[2148.04] I feel that
[2151.44] only I will have to suffer.
[2154.16] This constant friction of aunt Mehreen
has completely removed trust from between us.
[2162.80] No child,
[2165.00] do you have faith in your love?
[2167.24] More than myself.
Then that’s it,
[2170.32] don’t worry and I am with you.
[2181.12] You don’t need to worry
about Salman either,
[2184.96] I will not let him do anything wrong.
