[29.80] What is the matter? 
Why is everyone so quiet?
[34.00] Sister in law, Shaista, 
did you arrange a party for my son,
[37.20] so that everyone eats food 
in a sad environment.
[40.28] Hey, no, there is no sadness, 
lets all of us start eating.
[44.92] Salman, what will you have? 
Tell me?
[47.44] I…
[48.92] Wasai, pass me the kebabs, 
they are Salman’s favourite.
[55.12] Yes.
[66.24] Thank you.
[73.40] You know sister Shaista,
 you did great.
[76.64] You arranged everything 
so well for my Salman.
[84.32] What is the matter Urooj?
[87.52] You are eating food really half heartedly.
[92.64] No aunty, I am fine.
[97.56] Thank you aunt Shaista
[101.04] and Wasai,
[102.92] you really have a lot of taste 
in your hands.
[105.16] The food is really delicious.
[107.44] Thank you very much, little madam.
[113.84] Pass me the rice.
[185.68] You know aunt and 
uncle were really formal.
[190.00] I mean, so much staying 
in the same home.
[194.60] You tell me,
[196.24] how did you like this arrangement?
[232.08] Tea.
[237.52] Did you not make it for yourself?
[240.08] No,
[241.72] I don’t feel like it.
[250.24] Have a seat.
[262.72] You miss Urooj, right?
[266.72] I too miss her.
[270.80] Right now, only a few days have passed,
[275.60] but see,
[278.36] it feels like ages have passed seeing Urooj,
[285.12] meeting Urooj.
[288.36] She is our only daughter.
[296.36] As she left, she made 
the entire home vacant.
[301.12] I feel that she will come from 
this room right now,
[307.52] some times she will come from that room
[309.84] and she will tell me stories of her 
adventures as soon as she comes.
[316.48] Daughters have to sacrifice old love 
in search of new love.
[324.20] I am sure,
[326.96] Urooj will live really happy in that home.
[332.80] After all, who has brought her up?
[336.72] Okay,
[338.08] it is time for you to take credit.
[340.88] If the girls get praised, then 
the mother has brought them up
[345.76] and if there is a mistake, 
then the father spoiled them.
[351.24] Here, have tea.
[353.32] You drink it.
[354.40] You drink it.
[356.96] Urooj will be really happy.
[366.56] You too have it. 
Give it to me.
[400.24] Leave my hand.
[403.40] You didn’t answer me.
[408.72] I don’t have an answer. 
I have a question.
[417.92] What question?
[421.56] Will you be able to answer it?
[425.12] Go ahead, ask.
[428.60] The party that aunt arranged 
was for us, right?
[435.40] Obviously. 
Obviously,
[438.00] so aunt Mehreen ruined 
the entire environment.
[442.36] Urooj,
[445.28] don’t say anything about my mother.
[447.40] Why? After all, why can we 
not talk about this.
[452.08] If there is anything, any event,
[453.84] we have to go anywhere, 
come from anywhere,
[455.44] we have no personal life.
[457.44] Can we not have a personal life?
Urooj!
[462.92] I have no life without my mother,
[466.16] and you are talking about personal life?
[469.92] This is for the last time.
[473.40] After today, I shouldn’t have 
to make you understand.
[578.24] I know you are not happy.
[584.92] What you had thought couldn’t happen.
[591.68] Has it ever happened in all these years?
[599.16] One decision of mama,
[602.68] made my son someone else’s
[610.36] and now I am trying to get my small 
rights accepted.
[614.52] But it is not possible to refuse 
mama’s orders.
[617.56] So I had never refused it.
[623.52] To save Mehreen’s life,
[626.56] I considered my son Salman to be 
someone else’s child.
[633.92] It was not easy.
[636.76] Now it has started to feel 
even more difficult.
[639.76] Shaista, if you remember,
[642.00] then in mama’s order was the acceptance 
of your wishes.
[645.12] She unknowingly accepted your wishes.
[648.84] I had not made a wrong wish.
[652.36] Every mother in the world wants that 
her son owns everything.
[660.56] I too just wished that as well.
[662.88] Now Salman is the owner of everything,
the home, business,
[667.08] two factories and the shares.
[671.12] In return for that, it is right to consider 
Salman, as Mehreen’s son.
[675.60] Yes, so I accepted it.
[678.40] How else do I accept it?
[682.20] But the little happiness I want to achieve,
[686.56] Mehreen shouldn’t be a hurdle in it,
[689.84] that’s it.
[698.44] Then invite Salman and Urooj come 
to for a party some time.
[705.00] When will that ‘some time’ come?
[711.72] Exactly.
[733.52] Wasai.
[735.28] Yes, little madam.
[737.20] If you wanted something, 
you should have called me.
[740.16] Tell me, what do you want?
[742.60] No, I don’t want anything.
I just came.
[748.56] I am not used to sitting idle.
[752.88] You know,
[755.72] I have come from a full home.
[758.44] There I used to work in the kitchen 
all day long, I know how to cook.
[763.40] But, little madam,
[765.48] in this home, the owners don’t 
do the work in the kitchen,
[769.36] they order.
[772.84] and you think I will order you?
[775.88] Do you feel this way seeing me?
[778.12] No, little madam, you are a little different.
[783.68] And yes, you don’t be so formal with me,
[787.36] if madam hear is, she will mind it.
[791.44] Hey, what is this?
[794.04] How can someone get upset in talking 
to someone with respect?
[798.64] Wasai.
[803.20] Daughter in law,
[805.84] what are you doing here?
[809.52] Nothing aunty, I just came to the kitchen.
[813.20] Oh yes, I know, you are middle class,
[817.00] the kitchen is your final destination.
[824.68] But, now I have made arrangement 
for this too.
[828.96] What arrangement?
[830.96] Wasai, did you not tell Urooj?
[837.24] Now we will surely not need a chef,
[843.00] from today, you will take care 
of the kitchen.
[845.72] Oh wow, this is really good aunty.
[848.60] I will really like that I cook food 
for everyone.
[852.24] Not for everyone, for everyone else.
[859.00] Because I cook food for Salman myself.
[866.52] And I have not given anyone else, 
this right, okay?
[869.92] Sure.
[873.68] Work quickly, Wasai.
[881.28] Little madam,
[883.72] now there is no point in thinking.
[886.68] Only elder madam’s orders are followed,
[891.00] and everyone has to accept it.
[893.40] But there is one thing can be done 
against their will.
[901.08] What is that?
[902.16] That I make hot tea for you.
[905.16] No,
[906.32] today, you will make vegetables and 
I will make tea for you.
[909.72] But little madam…
I make really good tea.
[912.72] Have it and let me know.
[942.40] Urooj hurry up.
[943.96] The time you are taking makes me feel that
we are not going to reach for dinner,
[947.76] we will reach for breakfast.
[949.88] I am almost ready.
[951.88] By the way,
[953.52] mister looks in a really good mood today.
[956.96] What do you mean?
[958.64] Am I in a bad mood with you ever?
[964.36] No, no, mister is always in a good mood,
[968.32] it is never bad.
[970.60] So if you are ready, then shall we go?
[973.92] Let’s go. 
Let’s go.
[1003.96] Listen. 
Yes?
[1009.60] Why have you put on a 
dull color nail polish?
[1014.16] Did you not have a bright color?
[1019.32] Tell me,
[1021.16] do you not know at all 
about fashion sense.
[1023.68] Listen…
What do I listen to?
[1029.04] Where are you going, Salman?
[1030.92] Salman.
[1032.92] Listen, I will change..
[1044.88] Salman.
[1046.68] Salman.
[1074.68] What is the matter?
[1078.68] Why is Salman in a bad mood?
[1080.24] I don’t know why he got in a bad mood,
[1083.04] I will go call him. 
Stop.
[1088.64] He is my son,
[1090.08] I know well how his mood will get fine.
[1092.80] I will call him myself.
[1223.40] Yes, mom. Have a seat.
[1225.36] Thank you.
[1259.60] Like always, you have made 
a good choice.
[1262.40] Nice place. Good.
[1264.92] Mom, this is not my favorite restaurant, 
this is Urooj’s favourite.
[1272.04] Should I order something?
[1275.08] You know this is my favourite 
restaurant.
[1277.48] Yes. 
I have come here so many times,
[1279.24] that even the waiters would know 
what food I like.
[1282.12] And thank you so much for bringing me 
to my favorite place.
[1285.88] My pleasure.
[1287.32] Fine, then, you order something good, 
okay?
[1290.20] Fine.
[1291.20] Salman, I didn’t find this special 
to be really special.
[1294.24] I feel really suffocated.
[1295.72] Lets go to some other restaurant. 
Aunty, the food here is really good.
[1299.04] I am waiting for you people in the car, 
you people have dinner,
[1301.68] till then I will sit in the car.
[1303.32] Mom, listen to me.
[1305.40] Just a second. Mom.
[1307.76] Mom.
[1311.16] Mom.
[1312.84] Mom, please listen to me.
[1315.92] Why are you coming after me, Salman?
Go and enjoy.
[1319.12] Mom, we came for dinner with you,
[1322.40] how can we enjoy alone?
[1324.40] When it a place of your wife’s liking,
[1326.72] then how can you not enjoy?
[1337.16] Mom, please, don’t get upset. 
Please, come.
[1341.32] No Salman, now we will go home.
[1343.48] Come on, let’s go home.
[1346.84] But mom, we had to planned 
to come for dinner.
[1350.44] We wanted to spend good time together.
[1352.76] Yes, when have I told you not to?
[1355.12] Just drop me home and 
spend your good time.
[1360.80] Mom, you know,
[1362.60] without you how can I have good time?
[1365.84] Please, come on.
[1369.60] Come on.
[1374.12] My beloved mother.
[1375.96] Yeah right, beloved. You just butter me.
[1382.76] So how are your in-laws?
[1387.60] In-laws?
[1388.88] Everyone is really good. 
They really love you.
[1394.04] By the way, child, 
who all is part of everyone?
[1399.56] Everyone means, everyone, papa.
[1402.32] Uncle, aunt, and even Wasai.
[1407.20] And Salman’s mother?
[1417.20] Aunt Mehreen?
[1419.72] Aunt Mehreen, always keep an eye on me,
[1423.28] What I am doing? Where I am going?
[1425.64] what am I eating? what am I drinking?
[1430.12] Meaning,
[1432.64] she spies on you?
[1438.56] Why?
[1442.96] Mama, I am Salman’s choice
[1446.84] and aunty really loves Salman.
[1450.24] She loves him like crazy.
[1454.60] Then child, she should also love you.
[1460.60] You are Salman’s choice after all.
[1468.64] You know if you look at it, papa,
[1472.52] I have two mothers in laws.
[1477.16] Aunt too loves me so much that
[1481.32] it is difficult to differentiate between the two 
that who loves me more.
[1490.44] You know this seldom happens,
[1495.84] that even the aunt in law loves you.
[1503.40] Mama, the thing is,
[1507.04] your daughter is really lucky.
[1525.40] You too have it, 
you won’t eat an apple.
[1529.68] Our daughter is really lucky
[1532.36] that she got such good in-laws.
[1536.48] You are right. Come on.
[1559.28] To save Mehreen’s life,
[1562.04] I considered my son Salman to be 
someone else’s child.
[1567.20] It was not easy.
[1569.92] Now it has started to feel 
even more difficult.
[1572.84] Shaista, if you remember,
[1575.28] then in mama’s order was the acceptance 
of your wishes.
[1578.28] She unknowingly accepted your wishes.
[1582.00] I had not made a wrong wish.
[1585.40] Every mother in the world wants that 
her son owns everything.
[1604.36] Come in.
[1609.12] Boss, I need your approval on this file.
[1636.92] Listen Nawaz.
[1640.44] Be careful.
[1642.72] Boss,
[1644.20] before today has Nawaz ever given 
you a chance to complain?
[1649.60] Don’t worry.
[1676.20] Greetings.
[1677.48] Getting.
[1679.16] Where is my son going so dressed up?
[1683.40] Let me give him love, quickly
[1687.48] or else if Mehreen sees it, 
then she will raise hell.
[1691.92] I don’t think anyone will have 
a mother like mine.
[1698.12] The home became so lively with 
your bride coming here.
[1703.92] Before she came there was a weird 
silence in this home.
[1708.08] I am going to get that life.
[1710.40] Really?
[1711.32] Then quickly go and come back.
[1714.84] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[1723.64] Salman, where are you going now?
[1726.52] You just came tired from the office.
[1728.84] Yes, Urooj called, 
I am going to get her.
[1731.76] Why?
[1733.20] She has only been gone for two days.
[1736.04] But she wants to come back.
[1738.40] She is a weird girl.
[1739.88] Girls after marriage go to their parents’ home
and stay for long.
[1745.00] Are you happy sending Urooj 
to her parents’ home?
[1747.48] Do you love Urooj love this much?
[1750.12] No,
[1752.44] I only love my son.
[1757.08] Salman,
[1758.60] the thing is that Mehreen thinks
[1761.76] that Urooj should stay away 
from you for a few days.
[1766.48] Why?
[1768.44] So that your mama can shower 
her love on you.
[1773.88] So I already I love my mama a lot.
[1777.64] Yes, but now there is Urooj as well.
[1790.32] Okay fine, mama. I will go. 
Wait Salman,
[1793.28] you won’t go to get her.
[1796.36] What do you mean I won’t go?
[1798.72] Tell her to ask her father, 
he will drop her here.
[1801.68] Are you her driver?
[1803.84] Mama, she is my wife. 
What are you saying?
[1806.80] You are tired, that’s why I am saying it.
[1809.36] So what if I am tired?
[1811.36] I told you, you won’t go, that’s it.
[1814.96] Mom, please.
[1816.72] She is my wife.
[1820.12] It is my responsibility to bring her.
[1856.60] Son, you know when she was young,
[1858.76] then my phone would see the worst.
[1861.68] I would keep the phone and 
go somewhere,
[1863.92] she took my phone and run away.
[1866.32] The two of would run after her.
[1869.48] Papa, you tell him everything.
[1871.56] It is good,
[1872.88] we too should find out that you were 
really mischievous in childhood.
[1877.48] Okay uncle, we will leave now.
[1880.48] Hey son, so soon?
[1882.16] Stay for some more time.
[1883.52] Actually uncle, mom will be waiting 
at home, that’s why.
[1888.08] Fine, son,
[1889.60] if your mom is waiting then 
I cannot say anything.
[1894.88] Salman, I will go get my bag. 
Okay fine.
[1897.92] Come on, son, 
I will drop you to the gate.
[1901.60] No uncle, leave it. 
We will go.
[1904.28] Hey son, this way, we will spend 
some more time with you.
[1907.92] Come. Come on. Come on.
[1921.24] What I feared happened.
[1927.12] This Urooj did what girls 
who marry out of love do.
[1940.40] She made Salman hers completely.
[1945.04] She is only making him go around her.
[1950.80] I told him not to go to pick up Urooj,
[1957.32] but he went.
[1960.28] He went.
[1963.68] He ignored what his mother said.
[1973.20] Elder madam, I have brought milk for you.
[1978.84] I don’t want it.
[1981.84] I don’t want anything from here. 
Go from here. Leave.
[1985.56] Sure
[2011.76] Okay you go on, I will meet mama 
and come.
[2014.32] Listen, thank you.
[2019.72] What for?
[2020.80] Mama and papa were really happy, 
especially after meeting you.
[2025.96] Those people make a lot of arrangement.
[2028.72] Trust me, if they get into so much formality,
[2031.04] then I will stop going.
[2032.72] Why don’t they make arrangements?
You are their only son in law,
[2038.36] and then they also consider you their son.
[2042.16] That is true.
[2043.48] Okay, you go ahead, I will come 
after meeting mom.
[2066.84] Mom,
[2069.24] what is the matter? 
Why are you crying?
[2071.96] Mom, tell me, what happened?
[2075.40] I have realized,
[2081.68] I no longer have any worth in your life.
[2085.68] What are you saying?
[2088.80] You are my life. You are my entire world.
[2094.40] You only say this,
[2099.08] you have taken me out of your life.
[2102.40] Mom, how is this possible?
[2105.28] Come on, tell me, what happened?
[2108.36] I had told you.
[2112.48] What?
[2114.36] What?
[2115.92] Don’t you remember?
[2118.88] I had told you that you will not go 
to pick up Urooj.
[2123.60] She could have come herself or someone 
from her home could have dropped her.
[2128.68] Mom, you know,
[2131.44] Urooj’s father is old,
[2132.76] how would he have managed? 
That is why I went.
[2135.28] Amazing, Salman.
[2137.80] You bring justifications from God knows 
where for Urooj.
[2144.00] Now I have realized,
[2146.68] I have no worth in your life.
[2151.56] That is never possible.
[2154.24] I am the same Salman for you today.
[2156.64] Your Salman.
[2160.08] Okay come, stop crying now.
[2163.24] I promise you,
[2165.84] in future, you will not get a chance
to complain.
[2169.76] You just don’t cry.
[2218.56] Did aunty go to sleep?
[2222.04] No.
[2224.28] she is crying.
[2227.40] She is crying?
[2229.92] I will see. 
Stop.
