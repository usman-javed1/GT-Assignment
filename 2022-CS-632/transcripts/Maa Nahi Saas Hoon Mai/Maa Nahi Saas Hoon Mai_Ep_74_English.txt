Wasai. Wasai. Coming, younger madam. Yes? Areej is sleeping, 
stay with her. I will just come. 
Don’t leave her alone. Yes, yes, you can go. Madam, Areej, you did great. You came back to this home. Should I tell you something 
interesting? Elder madam considers herself 
your paternal grandma, although she is your 
maternal grandma, and your grandma… If I ask you to do something, 
then you are unable to do it. And you are sitting here and 
taking care of Arooj’s daughter. I serve everyone. Then why talk about younger
 and elder. Go and bring tea for me. 
I have a headache. Leave. I will make it in a little while. What do you mean you will 
make it in a little while? Go and make it right now. Right now, I am with Areej. I cannot go right now. Why can you not go? Leave her for a while, 
she is not going anywhere. No one will eat her. 
Go and make tea. I apologize, madam. Younger madam made me 
sit next to Areej. Till she doesn’t come, I cannot leave madam Areej alone 
and go. You have learned to argue a lot. I know well, because of whom you are arguing. I will teach everyone a lesson. and this was your paternal grandma. What sort of helplessness is this? Mama, you get fine soon. Have courage. Right now, you have to find out a lot and I will make you remember 
everything. Just support me a little. I want to hug you. Now I cannot wait any longer, mama. I cannot wait. Arooj. Yes? What are you doing here? 
I was looking for you in the room. Yes, I came to check on aunty. Come on, let’s go. 
Mom will get disturbed. Today, everything is similar to 
how it happened earlier. For example, 
what happened earlier? You forget. Don’t you remember, when Waqar had a daughter. And now Salman had a daughter. Even then a similar party 
was organized. People from the office came, they celebrated. And even today, 
the same thing is happening. Yes, and even then you were not happy
on the birth of that child, Areej and even today you are not happy
on the arrival of this child. Go and bring tea for me.
I have a headache. Leave. I will make it in a little while. What do you mean you will 
make it in a little while? Go and make it right now. Right now, I am with Areej. I cannot go right now. Why can you not go? Leave her for a while, 
she is not going anywhere. No one will eat her. 
Go and make tea. I apologize, madam. Younger madam made me 
sit next to Areej. Till she doesn’t come, I cannot leave madam Areej 
alone and go. Arooj. 
Yes? Where are you going? To the room. Come on, let’s sit in the open air 
for a while. Now such a time has come, that if you tell the servants of the home 
for some work, they have so much courage, 
they say no to your face. What happened aunt? I had asked Wasai to make 
a cup of tea for me. She said no to my face. She said that I am taking 
care of Areej. I had asked Wasai to stay with Areej. Why the surveillance at home? Could she not have left her 
for two minutes? Not at all. Why? At times, we are more insecure inside
the home, than outside. So you have to keep an eye. Salman, did you see? Aunt’s behavior towards me 
has become so weird. Even I don’t understand myself, although she herself loves you a lot. But she doesn’t love my daughter. What do you mean? Why would she be unhappy 
with Areej’s arrival? Leave it. No, if you had to finish it, 
then why did you start? Tell me. Because I just wanted to see if you saw this behaviour 
of aunt or not? Hmmm. 
Come on. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. We have named her, Areej and we want that you make Areej wear this bracelet. Yes. Salman, hold her. Careful, till then I will make her 
wear her gift. What is the matter, mom? Salman. Are you fine? Mom. Mom. Aunty, are you fine? Mom. Mom. Mom, wake up. Wasai, tell the driver 
to take out the car. What are you looking at? I am seeing how I strengthen 
the feet and roots of my enemy in this home. So strong, that we have no worth of our own. Why are you admitting defeat 
before time? I cannot deny what my eyes see. After the birth of the child Arooj has been able to make 
her place in this home. She has turned out to be so cunning. What did she name her daughter? Areej. Slowly and gradually she wants 
to take over everything. And for us, the danger is increasing with 
every passing moment. You are right. Where are you going? Nowhere, I am coming. Shaista, I am scared of you. Don’t do anything out of emotions, that things become easy for Arooj. I have become emotional Idrees. But don’t worry, I am not stupid. I will come. I am really happy that the distances between you and 
mom have reduced. What did the doctor say? There is nothing to worry about. But they have said that nothing 
that gives mom stress should be said in front of her. But I don’t understand, if it was a happy occasion, 
then why did mom take stress? Did someone say something? No. Nothing like that happened. Tell me something. You knew mom really liked 
the name Areej, right? No. Not at all. Why? Is that true? No, once uncle mentioned it to me. Just like that. I chose this name, because I thought Arooj and 
Areej are similar. Yes, I felt the same thing. I don’t know, then. Shall we go to Areej? You left her alone? No, no, Wasai is with her. You were so small Arooj, when I made a failed attempt 
to get rid of you. But what I will do now, the result of it will be success. Now neither Arooj, nor Areej will survive. Did Arooj tell you to take care of her or to keep an eye on me? No, nothing like that. You are being loyal to a 
child born recently? We have been together for years, 
Wasai. Have you forgotten that? 
Huh? Wasai, I didn’t expect you 
to be disloyal like this. Very bad. Wasai, it is your duty, you have to take care 
of the child with Arooj. There should be no carelessness. I have to support, 
younger madam, that’s what you said, right? Yes, she is Salman’s daughter, 
that is why I am asking you and then Arooj too had an accident, take care of her too. Don’t worry. I will do what you order me. If you don’t mind, then can I say something? Yes, go ahead. Madam’s demeanor… Yes, I understand what you are 
trying to say. I too see that sister in law 
Shaista’s behaviour has changed. Wasai, you keep both your eyes 
and ears open. Come on. You sit, I will go check on Areej. Wasai, why did aunt come here? I don’t know.
