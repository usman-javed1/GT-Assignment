[28.40] Where does that happen?
[30.76] That you should give all the property,
[33.92] all the business to a woman
[37.08] who is mentally unstable,
[43.92] she doesn’t know herself
[45.92] that who is this person who gave
all the property to her.
[52.88] What are you trying to say?
[57.84] Why don’t you understand?
[60.60] The second sharer in the property, 
where is he?
[66.04] Waqar’s all property will obviously 
belong to his wife and daughter.
[70.32] So where is the daughter?
[74.32] We cannot even say she is dead.
[80.48] Okay I will admit what you are saying
[85.16] but our Salman, what about him?
[89.52] That Mehreen doesn’t let go off her lap,
[92.76] what about that Salman?
[100.56] Now even mom has ordered that
[103.04] Salman is Mehreen’s son
[108.12] but what will my Salman get?
[115.36] Just think,
[118.08] Mehreen has lost her memory,
[121.64] Areej is missing,
[123.80] we don’t even know if she is alive or dead
[127.12] and Mehreen thinks Salman is her son,
[133.40] then who does everything belong to?
[136.96] Your Salman’s.
[147.40] Oh yes,
[150.36] I didn’t think this way.
[155.16] Idrees is right,
[158.32] Salman will get everything,
[162.76] My Salman will.
[246.84] Whatever I have thought will happen.
[253.24] It’s okay if Salman’s name is not there 
in the documents,
[258.60] but he is the only heir of the entire 
property and business.
[266.52] Now, what difference does it make 
if I raise Salman or Mehreen.
[295.72] I have kept your lunchbox in your bag,
[299.04] I will check your lunch box 
when you come home,
[301.16] I want the lunch finished, okay?
[303.36] Yes, mom. 
Good boy.
[305.00] Take a lot of care of yourself 
my baby, my life.
[359.68] Here, here run run run, come here.
[363.16] I will catch you. Hey.
[365.00] Salman?
[366.64] Salman?
[368.88] What happened mom?
[369.88] Caught my Salman.
[371.68] Mom, this is not fair, 
this is cheating.
[373.52] No matter if you call it cheating or what?
Mom caught Salman,
[375.88] now Salman will catch mom, okay?
[377.76] Okay.
Come, try your best now.
[405.84] What is this?
[407.12] This is a clock that is put on the wall.
[409.72] Very good and what is this? 
Kite.
[412.36] Kite. How does the kite fly?
[414.36] We make it fly then some other kite cuts it 
then it comes back flying to us.
[421.52] Good girl.
[424.00] And what is this?
[425.56] Turtles, they live in water
[427.80] and if they don’t like something 
they put their face in their shell.
[434.84] Yeah, and what is this?
[437.76] This is a bird that flies in the sky.
[441.68] Very good. 
You are very intelligent.
[514.36] Go, my child, Urooj, 
take care of yourself,
[517.68] I will call you.
[519.36] Okay, fine. 
Come on.
[529.16] Bye. 
Bye, my child.
[586.44] Are you blind?
[589.04] Can’t you see such a huge car?
[591.48] Sir its your fault.
[592.84] You were coming from the wrong side.
[599.28] You hit my car
[602.08] and on top of that 
you are arguing with me?
[606.76] Move, move, leave him.
[609.76] I am asking you to leave him.
[612.28] Aren’t you ashamed of raising hands 
on a weak man?
[615.28] You commit a mistake first and 
then you are hitting him?
[618.84] Do remember while driving that 
human beings walk on this road too,
[624.68] but rich people like you 
don’t care about that.
[628.92] Can’t you hear what I am saying?
[631.04] Leave him.
[634.40] What if I don’t?
[635.60] So then just say you don’t understand 
when someone talks to you politely,
[639.80] leave his collar, 
would you leave or not?
[644.40] Leave,
[645.72] leave,
[647.00] leave, leave, leave.
[651.00] Uncle, are you okay? 
I am fine.
[653.08] Did you get hurt. 
I am okay.
[655.24] Brother, take him and 
give him water.
[761.32] Greetings mom.
[762.24] Greetings, you are home, my child?
[766.52] yes.
[815.44] It was too hot today, right?
[818.28] Don’t do this mom.
[820.12] Yes, it was hot.
[823.16] Is everything all right, 
Urooj, my child?
[827.60] Why? What do you think?
[831.96] I can read your face, 
I am your mother,
[836.40] did something happen? All this?
[842.80] Yes, something did happen.
[846.80] Oh God! Hope all is well,
[848.48] what happened?
[852.16] Mom, I think a rich person is very sure
[855.48] that poor people shouldn’t exist 
in this world
[857.68] and poor people are just born to tolerate 
the power of a rich man in this world.
[862.80] Urooj,
[864.40] tell me properly what happened?
[867.12] Tell me everything is detail.
[869.76] Mom, I was standing on the road,
[871.64] a boy came in a huge car and started 
beating a man on a bike,
[875.28] and people were just standing there 
and watching this whole mockery,
[877.36] no one was saying anything
[879.00] and I was seeing it myself that the poor man
 on the bike wasn’t at fault.
[883.20] Oh God! God forbid,
[886.24] did you get involved in this whole fight?
[888.12] If I didn’t get involved
[889.56] that boy would have beaten 
the poor guy so much
[892.96] but listen to the fun part,
[894.88] why are you worried?
[897.44] When I went to him and ask him 
why are you hitting him and move away,
[901.28] it felt like the boy went in to a shock,
[903.92] he didn’t say anything just kept 
on looking at me quietly
[907.32] and he was just silent.
[908.96] Urooj, my child,
[911.48] these boys are the spoiled brats 
of rich parents,
[914.84] this world is full of them.
[916.80] Tell me something, how many people 
will you stop?
[920.36] Mom, if something wrong is 
happening in front of me,
[923.28] I will try my best to stop it.
[927.44] My child,
[929.32] people keep grudges, 
you tell me,
[933.28] why are you jumping in 
someone else’s fire?
[935.72] Mom, fire can be put off.
[939.08] Okay, go change your clothes,
[941.84] I will make something cold for you.
[943.96] And yes,
[945.44] today I am making my doll’s 
favorite Biryani for her.
[950.20] Wow, it will be so much fun.
[952.80] Where is dad? I don’t see him?
[955.64] He is out for work, And he said 
he will come back late.
[1001.56] It has been exact 7 years 
to mom’s death,
[1012.60] time is flying by so fast,
[1021.40] it used to seem impossible to live 
in this house when mom passed away,
[1029.00] we will get suffocated here.
[1034.40] Even I miss mom a lot, sister in law
[1039.64] but what can we do,
[1043.36] we cannot die with the dead.
[1051.52] I used to think of leaving this home 
after mom passed away.
[1059.52] I cannot even think that sister in law,
[1064.64] every corner of this house has the memories
 of my Salman’s childhood.
[1082.60] But sister in law Shaista,
[1086.92] how can you feel this love?
[1093.28] Because you don’t have a child.
[1101.16] Wasai? What did you break?
[1105.00] They don’t even know how to work.
[1117.60] Wasai?
[1122.04] Wasai?
[1126.00] What have you done? You broke 
my Salman’s picture?
[1129.96] Madam, it just slipped out of my hands 
while I was cleaning it.
[1134.40] Forgive me.
[1135.72] Wasai, don’t you have strength 
in your hands?
[1138.20] Yes? Go, go away from here
[1140.32] else I will do something, Wasai.
[1143.52] let me just clean the glass.
[1145.52] Wasai? Can’t you hear?
[1147.76] Go, go away from here
[1149.60] and don’t ever touch the belongings 
of my Salman ever again.
[1155.76] My child’s pictures.
[1223.12] What is all this?
[1225.96] Sir Salman, this is not my fault.
[1229.56] So is it my fault?
[1232.24] Tell me something?
[1233.56] All this was happening under 
your supervision, right?
[1236.24] Yes, sir, but…
[1237.84] But the fault is not yours, 
that is mine.
[1242.56] Sir, I never said that. 
You are fired.
[1249.52] Sir, what are you saying?
[1251.52] Go away from here.
[1257.96] Leave.
[1270.04] Salman, this is not fair.
[1272.96] You are taking out someone else’s 
anger on someone else,
[1276.60] you fired a 20-year-old employee 
without any reason
[1282.76] for a stranger girl.
[1284.12] She is not a stranger.
[1286.20] Then who was she? 
Do you even know her?
[1289.56] I don’t,
[1294.36] but I will get to know her,
[1297.68] very closely?
[1300.44] What is so special about her?
[1317.88] It feels like I know her from before
[1321.36] but met her for the first time.
[1325.44] I don’t expect such nonsense from 
such a huge businessman of the city.
[1338.16] You won’t get it.
[1357.68] Salman, you fired Mr Quddus from job?
[1360.88] Really?
[1362.12] So he wants you to request on his behalf?
[1363.84] No he didn’t speak to me 
but I got the news,
[1366.92] so I thought you should may be 
reconsider your decision.
[1368.96] Uncle, you know
[1371.08] if I take a decision once, 
there is no going back.
[1375.68] My child, loss becomes mandatory when ego 
and pride comes in the business.
[1380.44] profit or loss, I will accept it.
[1383.88] And by the way, don’t you trust me?
[1387.68] Why not? Of course I do.
[1391.44] So then it’s okay,
[1394.36] just relax.
[1403.00] What happened on your hand Salman?
[1409.12] This?
[1410.64] Nothing.
[1412.40] What do you mean by nothing?
[1413.92] If nothing has happened 
then why this bandage?
[1417.20] Yes, son, show it to me, 
you have been hurt.
[1423.04] Sister in law Shaista,
[1425.04] when I am asking Salman then 
what is the need for you to ask him?
[1436.60] So don’t I even have the right 
to ask him?
[1439.56] His mother is present here, 
so you don’t have any right.
[1452.04] I am asking you something.
[1453.48] I said nothing happened.
[1458.40] You guys keep on asking the same 
question over and over again.
[1462.08] What do you want? 
I shouldn’t eat food?
[1465.40] Okay, I won’t.
[1466.48] Salman, what happened? Salman, 
sit and eat.. Sal…
[1470.76] Sister in law Shaista, all of this 
has happened because of you.
[1473.72] What have I done?
[1475.00] What was the need for you
 to ask Salman?
[1476.92] You ruined all his mood.
[1480.48] And brother Idrees, you,
[1482.00] you must talk about the office 
matters in office,
[1483.92] else you know Salman never reacts 
like this on anything that I say.
[1487.76] My son is just…
[1494.08] My son, my son, 
my son all the time!
[1497.28] Stay quiet Shaista.
[1501.68] How many times have I told you
 but you won’t listen,
[1505.40] you have ruined the whole 
environment of the house.
[1516.96] Why are you standing here? 
Pick up all this.
[1520.48] Okay.
[1540.80] So then just say you don’t understand
 when someone talks to you politely,
[1544.88] leave his collar,
[1546.80] would you leave or not?
[1568.04] My daughter did the right thing,
[1570.72] we should always stand with right 
and against what’s wrong,
[1574.60] it is our duty.
[1576.12] Did you see mom?
[1577.60] I don’t know why mom is always scared.
[1583.92] you are our only daughter,
[1587.04] to be honest,
[1588.32] you are our everything
[1592.20] so I will obviously be scared.
[1595.08] Mom, love makes a person strong, 
brave and courageous.
[1601.60] It might but that doesn’t happen here.
[1606.68] indeed,
[1608.32] love makes a person brave 
and courageous.
[1614.24] Urooj,
[1615.88] your mother has a sensitive heart 
and mind too.
[1622.68] Yes, yes, you are the only intelligent one, 
Master.
[1627.32] Mom, dad is pulling your leg.
[1633.44] Oh yes, I have a news, I forgot telling.
[1637.44] I have an interview call tomorrow.
[1639.16] Oh wow. From where?
[1641.64] A multinational company, 
it is an amazing opportunity dad.
[1645.84] My daughter will definitely get successful.
[1648.32] If God wills.
[1650.12] Let me just get this job once
[1652.32] then all of us will go for an international trip.
[1655.36] Oh wow.
[1657.32] If God wills.
[1659.88] My child, have food, you taken so little.
[1687.12] You raise your hands on a weak man?
[1689.00] You commit a mistake first and then 
you are hitting him?
[1692.32] Do remember while driving that 
human beings walk on this road too,
[1698.20] but rich people like you 
don’t care about that.
[1714.32] Hi Salman?
[1716.56] Hello?
[1718.04] What are you doing here? 
Come on, join us.
[1723.64] You may go. I am not in the mood.
[1726.56] Why are you showing attitude,
 let’s join us.
[1734.88] I said I am not in the mood, go away.
[1740.00] Okay, sorry.
[1743.24] Have fun.
[1755.40] Are you okay?
[1757.88] No, I am not feeling well.
[1759.56] Come let’s chill.
[1761.52] I have to go.
[1763.28] We have kept this party for you
[1765.12] and you are leaving like this. 
This is not fair.
[1767.64] I said I am not feeling well.
[1770.80] But I have arranged all this for you.
[1774.92] I know, dude,
[1778.12] I will pay for all.
[1883.52] Wasai?
[1884.72] Did you prepare master’s breakfast?
[1887.28] Yes.
[1888.80] Okay, I will go check him,
[1891.72] even last night my son left without eating 
due to their nonsensical conversation.
[1897.64] Okay.
[1903.64] Good morning.
[1904.80] Good morning. Come, 
let’s have breakfast.
[1906.96] Mom, I am already very late, 
I will have it in office.
[1909.92] But this wrong…
[1911.08] Mom, I have to go, see you. 
Hey Salman?
[1914.72] It’s not good to leave home 
empty stomach.
[1918.72] Salman?
[1925.20] Salman? How are you leaving 
without breakfast my child?
[1930.56] Salman?
[1932.08] Salman? Salman,
 listen to me, son.
[1954.28] You look worried again today?
[1957.96] Master,
[1960.48] whenever I get thought,
[1964.84] I start feeling very heavy.
[1968.24] I have a fear that eats me,
[1974.56] the day Urooj finds out the reality,
[1978.20] what will happen Master?
[1980.80] She will never get to know
[1983.24] and who will tell her?
[1985.64] Don’t worry for no reason.
[1989.88] Come home early,
[1991.88] you sit with friends for so long.
[1995.64] Yes, yes, I will come early.
[1998.16] Listen, tell Urooj,
[2001.24] why does she interfere 
in others business?
[2005.04] Life is very hard, Naseema Begum,
[2008.92] the land is very narrow for cowards.
[2014.28] My daughter is smart enough
[2017.72] to know what to say when and how,
[2022.36] so you don’t have to worry.
[2035.88] Mom, dad, I am leaving.
[2039.32] We are coming, my child. 
Come.
[2050.36] Okay my daughter, 
in God’s protection.
[2052.88] Pray that my interview goes very well, mom.
[2055.76] It will go very well, don’t worry at all, 
if God wills.
[2058.76] If God wills.
[2060.60] Okay I am leaving.
[2062.20] My child, wait. 
yes,
[2064.32] I will drop you to the stop, 
I am going there too.
[2067.28] Okay. 
Okay, Naseema? Come.
[2133.16] Are you mad?
[2135.24] I mean you will find that girl at the same 
place again in this big city?
[2140.16] yes she will.
[2141.48] You are out of your mind, brother.
[2143.52] Okay, that is impossible though
[2145.80] but just because you are my brother, 
go, good luck.
[2148.84] My heart says that she will come,
[2151.76] she will definitely come.
[2159.56] So, here she is.
[2162.12] What?
[2163.88] I will call you later.
