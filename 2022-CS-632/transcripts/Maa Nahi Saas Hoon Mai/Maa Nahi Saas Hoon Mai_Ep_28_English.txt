I asked you bring the 
files of Sasa builders, where is it? Look Mr. Nawaz, I won’t get my answer if
 you stand here quietly. After all what is your issue. Madam that file is on 
Mr Idrees’ table, he refused. Refused? What is there in that file 
that he refused? Didn’t you tell him that 
I want to see that file? I will tell him to give you 
the data immediately. Oh so now you are going to tell? I have been correctly 
noticing for past 2 days that you are very lazy in terms
 of working. but I am always habitual
 of working on time, the company never had
 any loss because of me. Yes, I have a very
 good idea about it. Sorry madam.. Now go and bring all the files 
and data right now. Okay madam. What do you think? If I have started listening to 
whatever you say that means you should start misbehaving 
with mom and I will stay quiet? Sorry, that won’t happen. You are getting it wrong, 
I did not say anything like that. Look Arooj, I have taken you out of home and 
brought you to the office, now what do you want? Should I drop you off at 
your parent’s house? What do you mean? Look, it’s very clear, you cannot live with mom but I am incomplete without her, now you tell me what should I do? We will call a meeting for a it, there is nothing like that. Yes, yes. Okay, 
I will talk to you later. Yes Nawaz? What is it? Boss, get ready, bad times are about to come. What rubbish? Tell me what happened. Sasa builders files are 
being opened. Who is opening this file? New director of Finance, madam Arooj, who else? What will she get out of that file? What we have, I mean you have hidden. Boss that cannot be 
hidden for very long. Did you open your mouth? I guess I have to do
 something myself. Boss my job seems to
 be in danger itself. Madam Arooj doesn’t like me because I work for you. Boss, do something, I will die. Okay, okay, don’t worry, 
I will do something. You just keep your mouth shut. Okay boss, don’t worry about that. Go. Waqar never got to know about me, Salman trusts me blindly as well so, where did this Arooj 
come from? And why is she getting
 into accounts? Sasa Builders means that the corruption I did of 3 million
 will be caught. No, I won’t let that happen, my honor will be compromised 
in front of the whole family. I will have to stop Arooj. Salman. I don’t know Shanzey I couldn’t understand 
Aunt Mehreen yet. Arooj, like it has been 20 
years to your wedding and these mothers-in-law, you can never understand them umm that’s what my mom says about my grandma. Shanzey, I am serious, okay? Your home feels less like home and more like an ICU to me, where a daughter-in-law is
 always in a bad condition. I don’t understand, dude, Aunt is not happy if I stay home, or if I go to the office, she always has a problem with me. She has made my life so 
confusing in a few months only. When, what, how, what happens, I can never figure out. I am unable to figure out how 
she will react on what. What happened? 
Am I boring you? No, I would have revealed your secret 
if I had gotten something to eat. Yes, food must be here anytime, just eat well and suggest 
me what should I do. Arooj, that girl, I mean, I am sorry, your mother-in-law, she is very possessive, she doesn’t want anyone to 
come close to brother Salman and even unwillingly, you may call it your
 bad luck or your luck, you are brother Salman’s wife, and you are the closest to him. Uncle, you here, all of a sudden? Is everything okay? Please have a seat. Look, son, it is not the tradition
 of our family that women should interfere
 in business matters. Who has interfered that you 
are getting so serious? Are you talking about Arooj? Exactly, Mehreen and your aunt never even 
asked about the office matters. Yes, because they 
were never interested. And Arooj, Arooj is very talented, she can take care of
 the entire business, that is why she is taking interest. You tell me, what do you want? Look, son, the typical mother-in-law, 
daughter-in-law tension between 
Mehreen and Arooj is not hidden from anyone. If she will stay with Mehreen, she will adjust else the gap will never be fulfilled and you will be divided
 between both of them for life, because neither you leave Arooj, nor Mehreen, so that is why you should try to make 
Arooj understand it is not right to stay 
away from home. okay fine, I will talk to her. I will talk to her as soon
 as she comes. Why are you so quiet? Hmm, nothing. There is something. Arooj, I was thinking that instead of giving time to
 the office it will be better if you give time to mom. You are saying the same thing again? I think we have already discussed it and we wouldn’t do it anymore. And I am doing all this 
because you asked me to. I am not saying much to you, I am just giving you a suggestion that if you stay at home, it will be easier for me. And what about the
 difficulty for me? Arooj, look I… Look, Salman, for now I am very happy 
at the office and when I would want 
to leave the office, I will inform you that I won’t be coming to 
work from now on. I don’t know why are you talking
 about this to me today. I have just adjusted 
in the office, and I feel that now I have
 started to work there, and please Salman, don’t tell to my parents, they are very happy that
 I am going to the office. Don’t worry, I won’t come in, I am just 
going to drop you. Why? Won’t you meet them? No, give time to your parents. Why didn’t Salman come? When he came to drop you off, he could have come inside. You know that his business dinners 
are always on, he will come in when he
 comes to pick me up. He should, he is our only son-in-law, he loves our daughter so much so he should give us a 
chance to thank him. Now let Arooj eat, or will you keep on talking? Naseema Begum, she is hearing her dad with her ears and the food is eaten by mouth. Enough, enough, keep your philosophy to you. By the way, dad, mom’s scolding session is still on? See. By the way, my child you should have gone
 with Salman too. You are a part of the company too. You are a part of me first, dinners always keep on 
happening, dad, I will go some other time. Your mother has a lot of reservations 
about you going to the office. What sort of reservations, mom? Is everything okay at home? It is not okay, Aunt Mehreen tries causing me trouble 
through different ways all day. At least, I will stay away from her taunts
 and talks if I go to the office. What does Salman have to 
say about your decision? This is Salman’s decision only. So that is good and then a mother-in-law
 like Mehreen, a mother-in-law that doesn’t have a daughter 
of her own, expecting her to care is 
useless, my child. But Arooj, I don’t expect any
 sort of mistake from you. You are an obedient daughter, stay the same, you and Salman has to 
be on the same page. Naseema Begum, 
I am also an obedient husband. Mom, have food. Yes, I will take it.
 You take Salad. Yes, please take it, she has made it with 
so much difficulty, I got scolded a lot. you didn’t sleep yet? Have I ever slept before you came? Where is Arooj? Arooj, I dropped her to Aunt 
Naeema’s house. Wow, amazing Salman, you married Arooj so she doesn't give 
you any time at all? What are you saying, mom? Every girl goes to her 
parents' house to stay what is the big deal? Salman, I don’t like men 
who take their wives’ side and especially, in front of their mothers. By the way, if you don’t mind, the way you are defending Arooj, shall I give you a suggestion? What suggestion? If you want to listen to me, then drop Arooj to her parents’ 
house forever. I mean you want me to let my wife be at her parents’ house forever? You are joking, right? Your life has become a joke,
Salman. You saw that girl somewhere
 then you married her, you brought her home then took her to your office. I will bring Arooj in a while. Okay, Salman, consider what I said. Wasai, lay the food. Okay. Arooj, my child, a child is a mediator 
of her parents’ house. Wherever they go, they represent their family I know dad. You would even know that one person personality can give an opinion about
 the whole family to people. You have already said it 
to me so many times then why again today? Just like that. Okay, my child, listen to an advice. Say it. Always live with your
 head up in life. And that is only possible when your own
 personality is strong. Now that you have gone 
to the office, work with honesty that it progresses, prominent progress. I look after finance dad, honesty and integrity is the 
basic condition for me. Absolutely, that is what I am trying to say. Look you are at the highest 
post of your department, that’s a huge responsibility, where money is involved, it doesn’t take long for people 
to become dishonest. Obviously, there must be a lot 
of people working under you, never blindly trust anyone, check and balance is very 
important in money matters you are absolutely right, I am always in favor of strictness 
when it comes to rules and work and I have always
 learned that from you. Good job, my child, good job. I am sure about your success. Arooj, if you are done with 
your dad’s advices give some time to your mother too. Wow, that’s amazing, a mother does all the wait 
and preparations and when daughter comes, the family claims all the rights. Hey, now I have come to my mom. I understand everything, I understand everything,
 Naseema Begum. You are making my daughter 
against me that too in front of me. If you don’t mind, can I take 
some of her time too? Take it, take it. Come. Brother Idrees, complete what you were saying, why are you hesitating. Mehreen it is because 
of the kind of matter, it is not easy for me to talk about it. Arooj is a newbie kid in front of me, I have as much experience as
her age in the business. After all, what is the issue? I have been working for this 
company for years, I have given a lot of services to
 make your son a successful businessman but I think that gradually Arooj has 
started to impose herself in the business, like she is trying to control everything. Like she took my Salman in her control now she is trying to take over his business? I can see everything and I can even understand your pain. Anyway, leave that, Arooj is so sharp, she doesn’t look like that at all. You must talk to Salman. Salman makes decisions of the business and you make the decisions here. Now Salman doesn’t listen to me, he just listens to Arooj. Mehreen at least you listen to me, stop Arooj from going to 
the office immediately else she will destroy 
everyone’s life, yeah. Idrees, why do you 
want to stop Arooj? Hey why don’t you understand that whatever we handed over to
 Salman after a lot of thinking, there is a shareholder in it now. Arooj wants to control
 the whole office. There is nothing like 
you are thinking. Whatever Arooj is doing
 is for Salman only. And what if I say that she is treating me like 
an employee, then? No, no Arooj is cannot do that. So, am I lying? No, I am not saying that. You said as if I am lying. When I am saying she is not treating 
me right so I am being honest. Idrees, you can also
 have a misunderstanding, Arooj cannot be ill-mannered. Okay you will believe when Arooj
 kicks me out of the business. There is nothing like that, I don’t know what do 
you keep on thinking. You have had a misunderstanding 
for no reason, that’s it. I have been working for this 
company for years, I have given a lot of services to 
make your son a successful businessman but I think that gradually Arooj has started to impose
 herself in the business, like she is trying to 
control everything. Arooj is so sharp, she doesn’t look like that at all. You must talk to Salman. Salman makes decisions 
of the business and you make the 
decisions here. Now Salman doesn’t 
listen to me, he just listens to Arooj. Mehreen at least you
 listen to me, stop Arooj from going 
to the office immediately else she will destroy
 everyone’s life Wasai, is your Madam Arooj home? Yes, Madam Jr is coming. yes aunt, did you call me? Yes, I did, that is why you have come here. And by the way, I can’t find out where 
are you nowadays. Madam, may I go? Stand here., Arooj do you know what is brother Idrees and 
Salman’s relationship? Yes, I know. Brother Idrees is the 
elder in this house. I know all this aunt. It’s good that you know and it is also important for you to know. What have I done? I don’t know that but you won’t go to the 
office from tomorrow. Why are you looking at me like this? Have I said something impossible? Go, you may go now. Okay, madam. Aunt Mehreen started the conversation with the
relationship between uncle and Salman’s relationship and him
 being the elder of the family, why after all, why does uncle have so much
 issue with me working at the office? He wasn’t like this until yesterday. Is there any secret 
that is being hidden? And it can be revealed 
because of me. What can it be? I am just looking 
after the accounts. It means if there is any secret, so it is in the accounts. Arooj? Is everything okay? What are you thinking so seriously? Tell me something, Salman. You asked me to go to the office and then refused later on. I just want to know
 did you do all this because uncle asked you to? Yes, but why do you ask? Nothing. Don’t stop me from going 
to the office next time. okay, as you wish, you can go to the office. Boss I was telling you to do 
something about Madam Arooj. Has Arooj come to the office? Yes. And she is very active too. It means Mehreen 
couldn’t even stop her and she is doing all this 
by Salman’s support. I don’t understand, boss. Hmm No nothing, tell me what did she do now? No, she didn’t do anything but it looks like she is 
about to do something. A big explosion. She has asked for all the
 files of Sasa Builders. And boss, she is so intelligent, I am scared we 
might get revealed. Don’t talk rubbish, I will think of something. I have already done 
everything with so smartly, that it’s not very easy to catch. You just keep me posted 
about every moment, understand? Yes boss. Don’t worry. On 26th June, a payment of 3 million 
was made to Sasa builders but there is no receiving in the file.
