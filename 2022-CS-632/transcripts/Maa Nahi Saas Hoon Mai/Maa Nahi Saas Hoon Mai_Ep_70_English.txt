You are really cunning. You used to always be with Arooj, you used to show her love. Despite me asking you, 
you didn’t burn that picture, in fact you kept it safe with you, so that you show it to Arooj. Huh? You should be ashamed. You are really disloyal. Get lost from here, and yes, If I see you around Arooj, then I will teach you a lesson that you will never forget. Go from here. It has been so long that I have been loyal to this home and served everyone here. This is the reward I got for it. If I had to tell her, then I would have told her
 at the time, when so much injustice was done 
to younger madam, that little master is not the son of elder madam, in fact, he is the son of madam. I didn’t even tell anyone that this entire business belongs to Mr. Waqar. I never said that Mr. Waqar’s daughter got lost, and madam called me disloyal. It is true, a poor person’s neck is thin, everyone grabs on to it. God, you know my intentions. Give me patience. Give me patience, God. Okay Shanzay, 
I will talk to you later. Sure. Goodbye. Salman is your present, who you have under your control but I have come here to find out, whose family do you come from? Do you have a family of 
your own or not? After all, whose daughter are you? Mama. Hey! move back. Why are you stuck to me?
 Move back Mama What Mama? Move back! Why are you stuck to me? 
Move back I say! Move. Have you gone mad? Why are you calling me mama? I am not your mother. Mad woman. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Wasai. Ouch. Oh. Wasai. Oh. Wasai, where are you? Wasai. Wasai. Wasai. Rehman baba. I am in pain. Wasai. Wasai. Wasai. Oh. Ouch. Oh, Wasai. Wasai. Younger madam. Younger madam. Younger madam. What happened younger madam?
Get up. Younger madam. Younger madam, 
what happened to you? Younger madam, get up. Wasai, be quiet and
go call Mr. Salman. Sure. Sure. Hello. I am coming. Little master is coming. Little master is coming. Madam. Madam, wake up. Madam. Younger madam. Younger madam, get up. What is the matter, Naseema? Are you feeling okay? I am really restless. My heart is really worried, master. I will take out the motorcycle, 
we will go to the hospital. No, no, there is no need to go 
to the hospital. Then what should we do? Take your medication and sleep. No, I am not sleepy. You call Arooj, my heart is really worried. Arooj? Okay. It is ringing, she is not answering. Then call Salman. Arooj. What happened, Arooj? I felt dizzy.
I don’t know why. You feel dizzy? Come, we will go to the hospital.
I will get the dinner canceled. No, I am fine. Nothing to worry about.
I just felt dizzy. Arooj, what happened to you?
Look at you. You are not fine. Relax. I am absolutely fine. No need to cancel the dinner, just try to come a little sooner. Are you sure?
Sure. Take care of yourself. 
Yes. Okay, you sit. I am fine, you go.
I am fine. Mr. Salman. How is Arooj’s condition? Very critical. You should have been careful 
in such a situation and the mother fell from the stairs. The child could also have been harmed, the mother has got injuries. Look doctor, please. Please do something. Let’s see. We will try our best. Rest it is God who gives life. You just pray, don’t worry. Shazia, is the operation theatre ready? Yes, madam. 
Fine, then come on. Where are you going, Arooj? One minute. Brother, do you have methi puri? Make one. Arooj, what are you doing? 
You will get a sore throat. Hey, their methi puri is really good, I always have it from here. Okay fine, you eat. 
I will not eat it. You too will eat it. 
Okay one minute. I am telling you it is really delicious. Is it ready, brother? Hey, you will get unwell. Nothing happens. See, 
how yummy it looks. Okay try one. No, I don’t want to have it, you eat. Okay one, it is really delicious. Hmmm. This is really tasty. I had told you. Brother, make another one. Make one more. Just now 
you said you don’t eat it. All this looks so beautiful, right, 
Salman? It looks beautiful, right? Really beautiful. You will see our child will be way more beautiful 
than this. You know, Salman, you are really good. Really? How is that? Because you love the relation that has 
not come in this world so much. And the day he will be in your arms, how happy would you be? What are you thinking? Nothing. Okay. Do you know I have thought 
of a name for our daughter. Really? You know, I too have thought 
of a name. Really? What is the name? I won’t tell you right now and I am sure everyone will like 
the name I have thought of more. Salman. Hello Salman. Hello, son. Say something, son. 
What is the matter? Mom, I need you. Please come. Salman, are you crying? No. Salman, what is the matter, son?
Is everything fine? Nothing is fine, mom. Arooj’s life is in danger. You just please come quickly. Sal… Come on get fresh,
and feel better. All this is not good for our child. Okay tell me know, what name did you think of? I told you, I won’t tell you. And you won’t tell me either. I will announce the name of the child
 in front of everyone, and I am sure everyone will like it. Okay fine, you announce it 
in front of everyone, and you know what? We will name our child 
what you have thought of. Okay, be happy now. Smile. Really? Arooj is in this condition 
because of you. Be quiet, right now. At least tell me. What will you do finding out? What had to happen, 
has happened. Arooj was coming down 
from the stairs, it was dark. Her foot slipped and she fell. 
That’s it. This story is not as easy 
as you told this. Your doubt is absolutely right.
