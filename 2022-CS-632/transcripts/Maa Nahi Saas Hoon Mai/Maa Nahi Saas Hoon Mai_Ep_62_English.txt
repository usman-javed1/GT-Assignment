I know you are good. 
In fact, you are very good. We have been trying Mehreen for years, expecting good from her is out stupidity. But… The issue is of this but. Even you know what is correct. But still, no one is willing to say 
aunt Mehreen is wrong. You tried speaking the truth, was Mehreen able to tolerate it? Have no relation with your relations 
is a heavy truth. You are right, child. I cannot Salman my own, 
even after he is mine. Okay, whatever happened, 
happened. Be careful in future.
Okay? There, poor Salman is also worried. And Arooj, please, 
for God’s sake, you will reveal this secret 
in front of Salman. I will tolerate the suffering of Mehreen, but I cannot see Salman suffering. Promise me you wont tell him. Thank you. Where are you coming from? I had told you in the morning. So? Will tell me again break hell loose? Where are taking my son 
in the name of outing? My son is stuck in weird problems. You lied and took him to 
your parent’s home. Aunty, I am already really worried. 
I will talk to you later. Keep your worry to yourself, 
why are you worrying my son? The worries of me and 
Salman are not different. I don’t care about your worries, 
I only worry for my son. Where did you leave my son? Huh? My son is stuck in a weird problem. I will tolerate the suffering of Mehreen, but I cannot see Salman suffering. Idrees, when Mehreen got unwell, 
then… Yes, I know. I know that you know. 
Hear me out completely. Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. You called the same doctor who knows Mehreen’s history, right? Obviously, the doctor that 
knows her will come. I was scared. What were you scared about? What if the doctor had something 
about it, then? What are you saying Shaista? The doctor hasn’t found out recently, he knows since Salman’s childhood 
that Salman is not Mehreen’s son. How can he make such a mistake? Yes, you are right. I am right, but nowadays you are 
thinking too much nowadays. Mehreen has made me reach 
this state. Shaista, please. You tried speaking the truth, was Mehreen able to tolerate it? Okay, whatever happened, 
happened. Be careful in future.
Okay? There, poor Salman is also worried. And Arooj, please,
 for God’s sake, you will reveal this secret 
in front of Salman. I will tolerate the suffering of Mehreen, but I cannot see Salman suffering. Promise me you wont tell him. How is aunty feeling? She is better. Why did you not go to 
meet her yourself? You know she doesn’t like me. Mom has always liked everything I like. But I don’t know why this couldn’t 
happen in your case. Strange. In so long, this has happened 
for the first time, that you didn’t take aunt’s side. This will not happen now. I know mom is unjust at times. Now see, she has taken this to her heart that 
you said that I am not her son. Now this thing will not leave her heart. Don’t worry, I will take this thought from her mind. Arooj. What happened, Arooj? Everything is fine. Don’t worry. Now I feel I will have to 
go to the doctor. Yes, but why is everything fine? Now the surprise wont remain a surprise. It is not something that can 
remain hidden. Thank you so much. You know, you have given me the biggest 
happiness of the world. You sit, I will go meet aunty. Who is it? It is me, aunty. You. Why did you come here? Yes, I had to say something. Now what is left to say? Something is left. I was left to say sorry. I am sorry. You are Arooj, right? Yes. Oh, so you came to apologize 
for what you said. For a sentence that was 
left incomplete. Meaning? I wanted to say that, Salman is not just your son, he is also my husband. To highlight this right, I couldn’t complete my statement. I am sorry. You can say anything, Arooj but remember one thing. You have no right on my Salman. You are not well, you rest. She said something so big so easily and then she came to say, 
sorry aunty. Did you send breakfast to mama? Yes, son. I had told Wasai to take Mehreen’s 
breakfast to Mehreen’s room. There is no need for that sister in law, I am fine now. You seem completely fine now. I feel happy for you. Why wouldn’t I be? When the criminal accepted their crime
and apologized, then what is the reason 
to stay upset? Okay, that is a good thing. By the way, I also have good news for you. What good news? Arooj will tell you this. Arooj, tell her. Arooj, child, if it is good news, 
then tell us immediately. Arooj you will create a lot of suspense,
I will tell everyone. Actually, we have a doctor’s appointment today. Really? That is really good news child. You hid such a big news. Wasai, pick up all the toys and remove these pictures too. Yes, elder madam. Why are you removing the toys? 
What has happened? When you cannot have a child, then see these toys, they look so unreasonable 
in your room. Like binoculars in the hands of a blind. But don’t get the toys removed. I will remove everything from this home, that has snatched the happiness 
of becoming a grandmother from me. Wasai, pick up all these toys and
throw them in the store room. When a woman becomes a mother, then the husband becomes 
closer to her. In such a situation a woman 
becomes stronger. Arooj. Arooj, doesn’t give me 
any importance right now, if she has a child, then, I will just lie in a corner and no one will care about me. My heart is in a weird confusion. I... I want to be a grandmother, but I cannot see Arooj becoming a mother, either. The fever still hasn’t gone down. The doctor was saying it will 
go down in an hour. Here, I have brought the medication. Did you give her the medication
the doctor gave? Yes, I did, but her fever still hasn’t gone down. It will go down. If the doctor had given a medicine
to bring down the fever quickly, then the child wouldn’t be 
so restless. Arooj. Yes. Yes, mama’s love. Arooj. You will see our Arooj’s fever 
will go away quickly. You will be absolutely fine. Right? I feel, I will have to stop the search 
for my parents for some time. Come in. You can leave. But why Arooj? Why would you have to do this? My condition will not allow me 
to do this. Condition? But your condition is completely fine. I am pregnant. Seriously? My God. It is a great news. Shanzay, after the birth of the child, I will start searching for 
my parents again. And you will see, I will make sure I find them. Now won’t you get me sweets 
on this happy occasion? Hmmm…I will. But right now we have cake. 
Wont cake be enough? No, not at all, 
this cake won’t work. I want a party. Okay fine, you will also get a party. When? Such a big deceit. Oh wow. No matter how smart someone 
tries to be, they get caught themselves. Now madam Arooj is 
under my control. Now where do I start from? Should I start by humiliating Arooj or should I first tell Salman? Or should I make an announcement 
in front of everyone? Now, no matter what I do, this time Arooj won’t win.
