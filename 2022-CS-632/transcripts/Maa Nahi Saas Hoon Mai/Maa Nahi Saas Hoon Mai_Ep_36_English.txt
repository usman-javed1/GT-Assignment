Yes? Elder madam, you called? Where do you go around 
all the time? I was calling you for so long, where were you? I was in the kitchen. Okay fine, send Mr. Salman to me, and tell him that I am calling him, he should come immediately. Little master is not in his room. Then where is he? He still hasn’t come 
back from the office. He still hasn’t come from office? Okay, fine, you send Arooj to me. Elder madam, younger madam is not
 in her room either If she is not in her room, then where did both of them go? And no one at home knows. God be kind, Salman comes back from
 the office by this time. Fine, you leave and give me my phone on your way. Sure. Here you go, madam. Thank you. Leave. God be kind. This boy’s phone is also off. The entire office is empty, what are you doing here, alone? What is the work that you still 
haven’t closed the office? You know aunt there is a lot 
of work in the office. I thought why don’t I finish 
tomorrow’s work today as well. Okay, come on,
 tell me the real thing because of which you have hid 
yourself behind this work? No, why would I do that? So that you don’t have 
to face Salman. What difference does
 it make to him whether I talk to him or I don’t. Arooj, I can understand, whatever Salman did was intolerable. If Idrees to had put a baseless
 allegation on me, then I would never have tolerated it, I would never have spoken to him. I am tolerating it. But tolerating it is not that easy, because a woman is weak. You are not weak, nor are you alone. I am with you. I will say one thing, child. You don’t run from problems, you face them. Okay? Salman, God forbid, did you see anything 
with your eyes? No. You doubt sister-in-law, Arooj? I never doubted her. She herself is giving me 
the chance to doubt her But Salman, there will be 
some basis for doubting her. You know, when everyone told me, I didn’t agree. But when I told Arooj
 myself to fire Ammad, she clearly said no to me. You tell me yourself, what does this mean? Look Salman, you can take out any 
meaning of this, it is up to you. But what you are thinking is not true at all. I will go mad. You are going mad right now, by thinking this baseless thing. I am badly stuck. Then remove this worry, buddy. Discuss it with sister-in-law, Arooj. Ask her why she doesn’t
 want to fire him. No. I won’t ask her. You are the CEO of the company, the entire staff works under you, and she is not your staff, 
she is your wife. Sit and talk to her. I don’t understand why 
you are upset. You didn’t try to clarify what 
you wanted to say. I tried to clarify what I wanted in 
front of Salman on day one, aunt. But I didn’t find Salman and when I found Salman, he has already made several 
decisions in his mind. No, no, you are 
thinking wrong. Salman does 
think emotionally, but he doesn’t decide. It is good that you want to clear 
what you mean. I don’t understand 
what Salman wants. He is really stubborn. I know that. Believe me, now he must be sorry 
for what he did. How can you say that? That is why he is not coming 
in front of you. He is hiding his face and 
going around. That is not true. I know Salman really well. He will never be sorry
 for what he did. Why are you so misled 
towards Salman? When Salman can
 be misled about me, then me being misled is allowed. Look child, if any misunderstanding happens 
between husband and wife, then one of the two should move
 forward and clear the thing or else things get out 
of hand further, and then, this way, these baseless allegations also seem like the truth. Hello. Yes, Mr. Ahmad,
 are you in the office? Do one thing, book a ticket for me for tonight, I have to go to Islamabad. And yes, I will stay in Islamabad 
for four days, so also book a hotel. Thank you. Why are you going 
to Islamabad? I don’t want to go home. This means you are escaping. Salman, you do this when you have done
 something wrong. I have not done anything wrong. I have done nothing wrong. You are making something small, 
into a big issue. You know what the truth is,
 Salman? You don’t want to hear the truth. This is your biggest issue. Yes, I don’t want to hear it. Because this truth is 
unacceptable for me. This is actually my point. The truth. Meaning, you are believing 
something you have never seen. Man, I don’t understand why would anyone lie? What would someone 
benefit out of lying? You will find out what benefit someone has in this. In fact, you do one thing. You have a flight, right? You leave. But remember one thing, when you come back
 after four days, this issue would 
have grown this big. I am in a lot of stress. Such a big businessman, who used to solve such big issues,
 in seconds. And today on this issue… I cannot see Arooj in this condition. Are you embarrassed? No. I am just scared that I would make
 a wrong decision. I will leave. Salman. Salman. I said what I felt. Yes. This is the surprising thing that you said anything to me,
 without thinking. If you had said this to me,
 in another way, then  maybe I wouldn’t 
have disliked it as much as I disliked it right now. I have only met Ammad
 some time back and so much poison has been 
put in your mind. You are making something small, 
into a big issue. You know what the truth is, Salman? You don’t want to hear the truth. This is your biggest issue. Yes, I don’t want to hear it. Because this truth is 
unacceptable for me. This is actually my point. The truth. Meaning, you are believing 
something you have never seen. Yes, mama, go ahead. Where are you, Salman? Why have you not come 
home till now. I am on my way, I am going to the airport. Airport? I am going to Islamabad. You are going to Islamabad?
 But why? I have an important meeting, I am going for that. Why suddenly like this, Salman? You didn’t inform me
 in the morning either. I had to tell you, but I forgot. Okay, when will you come back? It will take me two to four days. Maybe, it will take me 
one or two more days. What is the matter, son? You seem worried to me. Mama, I have no worry. Okay fine. It is okay. Travel safe and take
 care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye. Whatever Salman did
 was intolerable. I will say one thing, child. You don’t run from problems, you face them. Look child, if any misunderstanding happens 
between husband and wife, then one of the two should move 
forward and clear the thing or else things get out
 of hand further, and then, this way, these baseless allegations also seem like the truth. If Salman is misled, then I will have to remove his
 misunderstanding. I shouldn’t make my ego 
the wall in my way. If Salman wants to move 
forward and fix this, then fine. I too will have to take a step further. When two loving people need 
the advice of a third person, then, there is a crack in the clean
 glass of relationship. Come in. Little madam, the food is ready. Come on, come and eat it. I am not hungry. Bring me coffee. Don’t take coffee at time of food, this leads to acidity. I told you, I am not hungry. If a person is worried, then when do they feel hungry? Hasn’t Salman come from office? Or is he in aunt’s room? She was asking me herself where little master is. Then she started to call. Who? Salman? Maybe. But I am not completely sure. You bring me coffee. Sure. As you wish. Salman is not in the office
 either, then where can he go at this hour? I will have to call him now. I think Salman doesn’t want to talk. Yes, Nasir, go ahead. I called just to check if you 
have boarded the flight. I am on the way. Look Salman, ego is like a thin glass wall. If you want to hurt your head then it becomes strong
 like a mountain and if you want to break it down, then it can be shattered with a touch. I am myself shattered right now. And gathering myself 
is really difficult. It is not difficult, Salman, if you try. If one hand would be yours, and one would belong to sister-in-law
 and they are extended. But right now, I feel extending 
my hand as my insult. A void shouldn’t come between 
two loving people. If the time to decide, passes, then the distances 
never gets reduced. Salman. We will take care 
of it in the meeting. Okay, I will talk to you later. Brother Idrees, what is the meeting to go to which, Salman didn’t even get the time 
to take his bag from home? No. what meeting are 
you talking about? The same meeting he went 
to attend in Islamabad. Huh? I don’t think there is
 a meeting in Islamabad. How is this possible 
brother Idrees, that you don’t know
 about the meeting Mehreen, I know everything, we have not planned any 
such meeting in Islamabad. Nor do we have 
a client of this level for which Salman has
 to go for himself. Then why did Salman
 go to Islamabad, and that too in this manner… I am sure. I am sure he has a problem. Look Mehreen, there can
 only be two problems, one in the business and
 the other at home. Now there is no issue 
in the business, that leaves the home. That means there is 
a problem at home, that is becoming the cause 
of this changed behaviour of Salman. Yes, 100% correct. That’s how it is. But if there is a problem, then where is the problem. Look, the two of us are standing here. That leaves Shaista, she really loves Salman. That leaves Arooj. I am sure Arooj is the
 cause of this problem. Arooj? Arooj, what did you do with Salman? Why are you looking 
at me like a fish? I am asking you something. I don’t understand anything aunty. You are not that unaware either. You understand well 
what I am asking you. What have you done that my son left the home and 
went to Islamabad. Aunty, I am just finding
 out from you that Salman is in Islamabad. Believe me, I don’t know 
anything about this matter, nor did I talk to Salman. Yes, when you upset my son, then why would he talk to you? Believe me, I didn’t talk 
to him about anything. I know nothing about this. Oh wow, Arooj, I used to consider 
myself to be smart, but you are much 
greater than me. You are getting upset 
with me for no reason. I honestly don’t know anything. Arooj, let me find out once, then you will see what I will do. Little madam, wiping your tears won’t hide them. In fact, they fall on the inside. And then they become 
sorrow for the rest of your life. You are right. You have given me 
a lot of courage, you too show some courage. Here. Have some coffee. No, I don’t feel like it. I know, little master is a little stubborn. But he is really naïve. He gets upset quickly, but he also agrees quickly too. I know him since childhood, I have brought him up in my arms. I am telling you the truth. Salman went to Islamabad 
without informing me. Why did he not tell me? 
I am sad about that. No, no, don’t get disheartened. You know everything 
about me, right? I still try to stay happy. You too stay happy, that’s it. Arooj, here you are upset, there brother Salman. One of you will have to remove 
this misunderstanding, then you do it. If I have to prove my character 
to remove this misunderstanding, then I don’t find this right at all. He should trust me this much that I am only his. All the things that 
you are saying to me, go and say this to 
brother Salman. I think he should know
 all this himself. Look Arooj, Ammad is just a friend of ours, but your relation with brother
 Salman is more than that. Why did you call me? What happened Salman, that you went to Islamabad 
without informing me? Who did I not tell? Me, Salman, who else? I didn’t find it important. Meaning, I have no 
importance in your life. I am your wife. Did you call me to tell me this? I have to say a lot, but you are not ready to listen. I have no room to listen to anything 
more after all that I have heard from you. How are you talking to me, Salman? Don’t you know from
 my attitude that I don’t want to talk to you? But why? You know the reason. I admit Salman is 
a little emotional, but nowadays,
 the way he is behaving is really weird. If Salman’s behaviour is weird, then surely something 
has happened. What has happened? I think the stories of Arooj and Ammad’s
 friendship have reached Salman. Friendship? What friendship? What do you want to prove repeating 
this again and again? Hey, what do I want to prove? The time and situation 
is proving it themselves. Do you have any idea, that the spark you are blowing
 on can also catch fire. Why are you dragging me in this? Because, instead of fixing Salman, you are calling him right. The one you are talking about is your daughter-in-law. I am not saying anything 
about my son, right? Salman loves Arooj, and you hate her. Hey, why would I hate her? But understand one thing well, that Salman doesn’t love
 Arooj anymore.
