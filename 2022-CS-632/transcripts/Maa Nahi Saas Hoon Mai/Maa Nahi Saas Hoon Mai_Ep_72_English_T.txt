[21.16] Arooj is absolutely fine and
you have become a grandmother.
[26.60] Yes.
[28.80] Wasai.
[29.72] Yes, elder madam.
[31.80] Tell the driver to get lots of sweets.
[35.00] My Salman has had a daughter.
[38.00] Yes. Yes. I will just bring it.
[112.00] Arooj has really good fate.
[120.88] You be quiet.
[307.44] You had scared me.
[317.24] I felt that my life is over.
[325.64] Your life got saved.
[337.64] In fact,
[340.08] it brought another life in this world.
[366.28] You are really brave.
[371.04] You tolerated a lot of pain,
[376.84] but you didn’t let anything 
happen to our child.
[385.60] Mothers can do anything 
for their children.
[402.24] I understood this pain today.
[422.32] What do we have in it?
[428.60] You know,
[435.44] I learned today that
[439.68] even the thought of living my life 
without you will kill me.
[454.20] I cannot live without you.
[486.12] Come in.
[513.84] How are you now, 
younger madam?
[518.16] I am in front of you, Wasai.
[521.20] I am fine.
[530.20] Send mom inside.
[535.76] She left.
[539.36] She left?
[543.28] She left?
[552.80] I had thought that
[558.84] I will hug mama, she will love me,
 she left.
[564.08] Arooj,
[566.08] aunt Naseema is outside.
[572.28] She is talking about mom.
Mom has gone home.
[581.28] Yes, yes,
[582.88] maybe younger madam 
didn’t hear me correctly.
[594.44] Should I go call aunty?
[603.20] I will bring her.
[608.40] Wasai, you stay.
[618.16] Thank God, younger madam,
[621.16] your life got saved.
[631.80] But what was the need for you 
to come to the stairs?
[640.08] I got worried in the darkness, Wasai.
[648.04] You know,
[650.36] I cut the foot with glass.
[657.92] I started bleeding,
[661.24] so I called out to everyone, 
but no one came.
[668.60] So I stepped down the stairs 
and started looking for you
[674.12] and I felt that
[677.48] someone pushed me.
[685.92] But no,
[689.32] maybe it is my imagination.
[696.52] Who will push me?
[706.88] But I didn’t tell this to Salman,
[710.72] because he would have created 
a scene in the entire home.
[715.32] I have a similar doubt.
[724.56] I have no proof,
[728.80] but I also know
[731.56] that you have enemies 
in this home.
[737.56] Who?
[783.36] Your second plan also flopped.
[805.52] No.
[809.80] it has not flopped.
[814.52] Arooj just has good luck, 
that’s all.
[818.96] This means,
[820.64] we have bad luck, 
and we should accept it.
[823.88] Accept defeat,
[827.04] when I give up.
[831.36] The game that is being played,
defeat is in front of us
[834.80] and we will not have any other 
option but to accept it.
[841.96] Don’t worry Idrees Ahmed,
[844.84] I have still not run out of arrows
 in my quiver.
[854.40] What are you going to do now?
Tell me.
[861.52] We only have two enemies 
in our home.
[868.72] One is Arooj,
[870.80] the other is Mehreen.
[878.76] Now we will do one thing, 
that we will tell Mehreen
[882.36] that Salman is not her son,
he is our son.
[887.64] What will that do?
[889.12] This shock will drive Mehreen mad.
[894.44] But our target is Arooj, who has 
the entire business in her name.
[898.52] It is necessary to defeat Arooj’s luck.
[902.28] We don’t have time.
[905.96] That’s why we will have to 
change the plan.
[908.80] No. No, think of something else.
[911.76] And keep in mind that we are 
competing against the wind.
[914.88] A little carelessness
[917.68] will throw us at a new place.
[921.84] Remember that.
[949.00] You will find more wives,
[951.60] but this child is your blood,
[954.16] your future generation.
[957.88] What are you saying aunt?
[963.48] Arooj is fighting between life 
and death there.
[966.92] She loves me so much, 
and you are telling me
[969.12] that I tell the doctor to save 
the child and let Arooj die.
[975.04] I think about the child who hasn’t 
come in this world,
[977.60] and the one with whom 
I have spent so much time,
[980.00] I leave her, I let her die.
[982.44] No, Salman…
[983.44] Salman is right sister in law, Shaista.
[991.20] If Arooj is important for Salman,
[994.12] then Arooj’s life is important for us.
[1001.88] Don’t worry,
[1003.36] nothing will happen to Arooj.
[1005.44] Sign it.
[1027.52] I didn’t make a decision 
is Arooj’s favour,
[1029.76] I made a decision is Salman’s favour.
[1033.56] I have no interest in Arooj,
[1036.16] apart from this,
[1038.16] that Salman loves her a lot.
[1043.84] And the one who is important for 
Salman is also very important for me.
[1050.44] Did you not get this thought 
really late?
[1059.20] Till yesterday, 
you didn’t like Arooj at all
[1062.20] and today,
[1063.80] you like Salman’s choice.
[1068.88] Till now,
[1070.32] you too used to take her side a lot, 
sister in law, Shaista.
[1073.88] Now what new flaw has come 
in front of you that
[1077.48] you know
[1079.56] and you are hiding it from me.
[1081.40] No, no, Mehreen, I was saying this 
because of you…
[1083.96] No, sister in law, Shaista not 
because of me.
[1088.04] It is something else.
[1090.92] Anyway,
[1093.00] you don’t tell me,
[1095.28] I will find out.
[1161.48] Tell me, Wasai, 
I am worried.
[1166.80] Younger madam,
[1169.24] I don’t want to worry you,
[1180.64] but it is necessary for the loyalty
[1184.44] and faithfulness of this home,
[1187.88] that I advice you to be careful.
[1196.60] Are you pointing towards, aunt?
[1205.96] It can be.
[1218.04] Because when elder madam 
had brought that soup,
[1223.44] that soup had fallen,
[1233.36] and as soon as the cat had 
the remaining soup,
[1241.52] it died at that very moment.
[1258.12] How can aunt do this?
[1268.48] Someone can hate another person,
[1271.60] they can dislike someone,
[1275.40] but how can someone take 
someone’s life?
[1280.48] You are really naïve, 
younger madam.
[1292.64] Those who are cruel can 
also take lives.
[1299.08] So,
[1301.04] my daughter. She…
[1303.60] You rest.
[1307.84] Your daughter is absolutely safe.
[1315.36] You don’t worry.
[1324.60] They have kept her in the 
baby care right now.
[1355.48] I am badly stuck, Wasai.
[1364.92] I don’t understand
[1367.56] who do I go and tell all this to?
[1371.24] I can understand.
[1381.16] But if elder madam’s mental condition
 was not bad
[1387.36] and her life was not in danger,
[1397.76] then I would have told everyone 
the truth in one moment
[1402.68] and made madam unsuccessful.
[1417.48] But right now, we will have to 
keep this secret a secret.
[1433.24] No Wasai.
[1443.56] I will have to do something.
[1476.08] Okay,
[1477.64] I had made soup for Arooj.
[1482.36] For me?
[1484.24] Yes.
[1485.92] Why?
[1487.24] Can I not make soup for you?
[1490.52] You can.
[1493.04] You surely can.
[1496.32] Mom, when we come 
from an outing,
[1498.44] then Arooj will come back 
and have it.
[1499.56] No, no, Salman, we will go 
after having soup.
[1503.24] First I will drink the soup.
[1506.08] Arooj,
[1508.04] you were feeling restless,
you were not fine.
[1511.96] The restlessness will be removed.
In fact,
[1513.96] the restlessness has been 
removed.
[1515.84] She made soup for me 
with so much love.
[1518.08] I will have soup and…
[1563.36] Your wife is really lucky.
[1566.04] I think a prayer of yours 
came to help.
[1568.80] Arooj is now out of danger,
[1571.92] and congratulations to you,
[1573.52] God has given you 
a beautiful daughter.
[1579.80] Thank you so much doctor, 
can I meet Arooj?
[1583.64] Yes, we are shifting her to the room,
then you can meet her.
[1587.64] Thank you.
[1589.68] Come on.
[1591.96] Mom, did you hear 
what the doctor said?
[1594.12] Arooj is absolutely fine,
[1596.96] and you have become 
a grandmother.
[1599.16] Yes.
[1601.48] Wasai.
[1602.48] Yes, elder madam.
[1604.48] Tell the driver to get lots of sweets.
[1607.64] My Salman had a daughter.
[1617.36] Salman is your present,
[1621.24] who you have under your control.
[1624.64] But I have come here to find out,
[1628.04] what family do you belong to?
[1636.04] Do you even have a family or not?
[1643.04] Whose daughter are you?
[1648.52] Mama.
[1657.72] Hey.
[1659.08] Move back.
[1660.84] Why are you stuck to me? 
Move back.
[1663.24] Mama.
[1664.28] What mama? Mama? 
Hey, move back.
[1668.08] Why are you after me? 
Move, I tell you.
[1671.44] Move.
[1673.72] Have you gone mad?
[1675.64] Why are you calling me, 
‘mama’, ‘mama’?
[1677.56] I am not your mother.
[1687.08] Yes, Salman, go ahead.
[1689.32] Mom, you should have met Arooj,
[1692.04] she would have liked it.
[1694.64] I came to the hospital.
[1697.20] Did you like it?
[1704.80] That’s it.
[1706.60] I just wanted that.
[1710.60] And you didn’t even see 
your granddaughter.
[1713.56] I saw her.
[1730.24] She is my granddaughter.
[1733.04] After all, someone should be 
at home to welcome her.
[1747.84] And I will do that.
[1750.80] Okay fine,
[1752.92] goodbye.
[1754.40] Goodbye.
[1775.36] Son, Salman,
[1780.72] what is the matter?
Is all okay?
[1785.52] Yes, aunt.
Everything is fine.
[1821.64] When is everything fine?
[1827.24] Mehreen’s hatred for Arooj
[1830.40] always gives me an opportunity.
[1834.52] Stop it, Shaista.
[1835.88] Let it go on like this for a few days. 
We will do something about Arooj later.
[1842.48] I have told you,
[1844.60] we don’t have time.
[1850.08] Whatever, we have to do about Arooj,
we have to do it really soon.
[1861.84] Come on.
[1875.44] All of you are lazy.
[1877.96] What is your duty?
[1879.36] To keep a check on the generator,
 right?
[1881.16] Yes, sir.
[1883.00] So the generator is automatic.
[1884.72] So when the light went, 
why didn’t it turn on?
[1887.48] Sir, someone had switched off 
the breaker.
[1890.80] I have switched it on.
[1896.24] What do you mean someone 
had switched off the breaker?
[1898.72] Who goes there apart from you?
[1900.72] No one, right? You people 
take care of it, right?
[2002.48] Madam, you here?
[2006.28] Was there any work?
[2008.72] Yes, I had some work.
[2010.00] What are you doing here?
[2011.60] Go out. Go out of here.
[2014.56] Sure.
[2045.76] Wasai.
[2074.52] Ouch. Ouch.
[2089.72] Yes, sir.
[2090.76] What, sir, sir are you saying?
[2093.64] What is this sir, sir?
[2095.84] If God forbid something had happened
because of your carelessness.
[2099.44] Had something happened 
to Arooj, then?
[2101.96] Lazy idiots, they are lazy, 
they don’t work.
[2105.04] Come on, go from here.
[2109.24] They are weird people, 
they saw nothing.
[2110.96] Did you see the situation became?
[2112.60] I know, son. Sorry.
[2114.64] Just relax.
[2116.72] Come on. Come. Come.
[2117.96] Come on.
[2130.28] Wasai,
[2131.68] I don’t want anything lacking 
in today’s function.
[2135.60] Everything should be perfect.
[2137.56] Don’t worry, madam.
[2140.44] I have explained everyone 
their work really well.
[2144.40] You did good.
[2146.68] Wasai,
[2148.52] did you see the child?
[2150.92] Yes.
[2152.36] She is really pretty.
[2155.32] Hmm.
[2156.40] She is really pretty.
[2162.24] But Wasai,
[2164.72] there was something special 
on her face.
[2169.40] Special.
[2171.20] What was special?
[2178.00] She seemed just like 
your picture to me.
[2187.76] The same eyes.
[2189.28] The same nose. 
Everything.
[2194.60] My picture?
[2196.36] Yes.
[2204.04] Now obviously,
[2205.36] she is little master’s daughter,
[2207.48] so she would be like you.
[2211.12] Yes.
[2212.68] Wasai, it is your duty,
[2215.40] you have to take lots of care 
for the child along with Arooj.
[2222.40] There should be no carelessness.
[2225.72] I have to support younger madam,
[2228.92] that’s what you said, right?
[2232.80] Yes.
[2237.48] I am saying it because 
she is Salman’s daughter
[2244.20] and then Arooj too had an accident.
[2247.68] Take care of her too.
[2250.36] Don’t worry at all.
[2252.92] I will do as you order me to do.
[2263.64] If you don’t mind,
[2266.16] can I say something?
[2270.20] Yes, go ahead.
[2275.04] Madam’s style…
[2279.60] Yes,
[2282.08] I understand 
what you are trying to say.
[2290.92] I too am seeing that the behaviour 
of sister in law, Shaista is changed.
[2302.20] Wasai,
[2304.16] you keep both your eyes 
and ears open.
