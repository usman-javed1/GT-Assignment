Dad, forget about this now. What Arooj did was wrong, and I'll ensure she faces
 the consequences. I promise. But my position in front 
of your mom is ruined Mom didn't take it seriously. Arooj has hurt me deeply,
 my son, especially with such an accusation 
at this point in life. Your phone is ringing,
 answer it. No issues, it is not important. Dad, don’t worry, now I am no longer the Salman
 who trusted Arooj blindly. Whatever she did, she will have to answer for it. Thank you, Salman. Thank you, son. You saved your father’s
 respect at this age in his life. Dad, your phone is ringing again. It must be an important call. You can answer it, I will leave. Yes, Musarrat? Idress, I met Arooj in the market. What? Again? I don’t know, I went for shopping. I don’t know where I found her, where did she saw me. She stopped me. She started questioning me. Thank God, her phone rang, and I got away from there. This has nothing to do 
with my victory or defeat. You have a second wife, keep her with respect, make a home, and also let me live
 my life peacefully. So, then you won, right? What is wrong, younger madam? Is everything okay? I hope everything will be fine soon. Did you not have shame keeping
 relations with a married man? Not relation, marriage. You are lying. You’re a home wrecker. I didn’t know. Idrees told me that
 he divorced his wife, he is single. and you believed him? If a man cries and asks 
a woman for sympathy, then the woman becomes 
helpless. I thought there is a man
 troubled by circumstances, a worn-out person, who needs support. What? He is still left to be worn-out. Why are you insisting? We are living a good life. I am telling you I will fix everything. Believe me. Enough! That’s it, Idrees. I don’t believe your lies
 and false promises. I want respect of our 
relation in the society. Hey, so you announced it? Stop it. Leave now. Why should I go? I will not go from here. I am your wife and I want the right of being your wife. Wife? Will you live your life quietly or else, you will suffer all your life. You will not be able to prove that we have been married. I doubted your actions earlier, but I thought that no, you are unable to take out time 
because of being busy at work. But when you ignored our son, that’s when I was sure that something is surely wrong. For this day, I had already taken out
 our wedding papers. Look, you are not understanding. You are listening to that Arooj. She is using you, so that she can take away
 all the wealth. Don’t you want that, me you and our child live 
a happy life. You want it or not? 
You want it, right? A woman is so weak and especially that woman, who is someone’s second wife. She always gets second priority. Even her children never 
get the first priority. Then, she takes support
 of reasoning, to save her fragile home 
and relationship. Sakeena.... Lesten to me... I am not from amongst 
those wives, who sits down to cry
 seeing their husband ... ...in a relation with some
 other woman. I have a young son. Now he will deal
 with these matters. Salman? Why are you involving 
Salman in these matters, he has to do a lot of 
things in business. Why are you worried? You just said that woman is a liar. Yes, she… So, we will see. Salman is coming home 
from the office. Pray that woman 
turns out to be a liar. Hey, my beloved Arooj, come here. Yes? What happened? Did you meet Idrees’s
 second wife? Huh? And if you have not met her, then make someone else
 his second wife and bring her. You are an expert in such trickery. Aunt! I have not played any tricks, aunt. You can think 
what you want. Then, where is she? Where is my co-wife? You can say what you 
want to say to me, I will hear it. But believe me, aunt Musarrat is uncle’s 
second wife. shhhh... Don’t talk nonsense to me. Idrees cannot be anyone
 else’s other than me. You are mistaken. Madam, your tea. What is the matter, mom? You had called. Is everything fine? Son, she came, she sat here, and she left suddenly. What do you mean who sat here? Who? His second wife. Second wife? What do you mean? 
What are you saying? I don’t understand. As soon as you left for office, a woman came and said she is his second wife. Hey, she was lying. She was lying. I don’t know if she was speaking 
the truth or lying, but she had wedding papers… Hey, I said those were fake. I have told you, what relation will I have with 
another woman with you there? And you got fooled by her. If she was honest, then she 
would be sitting here. Yes. Whoever she was, honest or liar, but why did she come here? Son, only Arooj can tell us this. What do you mean? What does Arooj have 
to do with this matter? Yes, Arooj called her here. And she introduced her to me as Mrs. Idrees Ahmad. She is really cunning, son. She knows that she can 
only take over the wealth when there are misunderstandings 
between us or else, who do I have other 
than you or Shaista? Huh? Careful, Arooj. Areej just slept. What happened, Arooj? What, mama? No planning ever works for us. I don’t understand anything, 
Arooj. I made uncle Idrees’s 
second wife come and stand in front of 
everyone here and you see, she changed in 
front of everyone. She made me a criminal 
in everyone’s eyes instead. Brother Idrees is a
 really cunning man. He must have surely 
schemed something, because of which that woman 
is running away from her right. Yes, but what do I do about Salman? What did Salman do? He wants that 
I apologize to his parents. I will never apologize, because those people 
are not worthy of it. Doing this would be
 my insult, mama. So, no one can force 
you either, Arooj. You are my daughter, and I am still alive right now. I will break every hand 
that is extended towards you. I am scared mama. I don’t know what will happen. Arooj, don’t worry, my love. What my God wants will happen. Wasai. Wasai. Make tea for madam 
Arooj and bring it. Salman... Story staring. I will call Idrees. Hun Where are you going? Come, have a seat. I have got tea made. Shaista, I am unable to look
 you in the eyes. What does this mean? Arooj has degraded
 in your eyes, in fact, in my own eyes. Honestly. Wasai. Wasai. Yes. Yes, coming little master. Yes? Go, call Arooj. Sure. Salman son... Now you can restore 
your father’s respect. Nothing has happened 
to your respect. You won’t get it Shaista. At this point in my life, I only have pride of my character, Arooj even snatched that away. Yes. Younger madam, little master is calling you. Why? I don’t know about that. Where is Salman? He is sitting in the
 lounge downstairs. and who else is downstairs? Elder sir, and madam. Go and tell Salman, whatever he wants 
to talk about he should come 
upstairs and do it. I won’t come. Sure. What happened? Did you meet Idrees’s
 second wife? And if you have not met her, then make someone else his 
second wife and bring her. You are an expert in 
such trickery. Aunt, I have not played any tricks, aunt. You can think 
what you want. Then, where is she? Where is my co-wife? You can say what you want 
to say to me, I will hear it. But believe me, aunt Musarrat is uncle’s 
second wife. shhhh Don’t talk nonsense to me. Idrees cannot be anyone
 else’s other than me. Where is Arooj? Why is she not here till now? She… Why are you quiet?
 Answer me. This means, she is not coming. I will go and see! Come with me. Leave my hand. Leave it, I said. What do you think of yourself? What is your worth in 
front of my mom and dad? I am your wife; this is my worth. Stop your nonsense. This drama you had
 created it is all a flop. Come nicely, with respect and go and apologize 
to my mom and… I will not apologize to anyone, because I am right in my place. Arooj, don’t make me angrier. Or else, what? What will you do? Huh? What will I do? I will do what you
 haven’t even imagined. One minute. Today, I will show you. Look at this file. Read it. Read it. What is this? The home aunt
 Musarrat lives in, is my papa’s property, and uncle is stealing 
money from the office. They are living on 
the office expense. Say all this is a lie,
 it is all wrong. Why don’t you say something? Say it! Arooj! Elder madam, get up quickly.
 Come with me. What happened, Wasai? Younger madam, 
and little master. What happened between 
Salman and Arooj? I am telling you, now don’t say anything
 against my mom and dad. Mom was absolutely right. You are cunning. Because of you, this home and its
 relations fought. Only because of you. Look, there is still time. I am asking you with a lot of love, come on, go and apologize… I told you; I will not 
apologize to anyone. You won’t apologize? No. Arooj. Salman. Move back. Don’t touch my daughter.
