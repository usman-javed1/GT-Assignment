[89.60] Yes, Musarrat? Tell me
[90.64] why have you 
called me at this time?
[93.76] I call you all the time,
[98.12] it’s you who don’t pick up.
[101.12] Come to the point,
 I am in office right now.
[103.72] You care so much 
about your business,
[111.20] and me,
[113.12] my son,
[114.40] you don’t care about
 our lives at all, Idrees.
[117.68] I OD so much, 
what else do you want?
[120.04] I want my position, Idrees.
[122.60] I can’t hide and live anymore now.
[131.32] I need my status.
[134.00] You are a second wife 
and that is your status.
[137.36] I didn’t know
[140.00] this is a second marriage,
[142.24] you lied to me.
[150.80] to me,
[152.44] you made me dream about luxury,
[160.16] however, forget about luxury,
[164.12] even my needs are not fulfilled.
[166.64] I do so much already, 
what else do you want?
[169.84] Really?
[171.20] So tell me what
 have you planned
[174.08] regarding your son,
[181.20] his future, our future?
[185.60] There is nothing more in my hands,
[187.24] what else can I give you?
[189.68] Look Idrees,
[191.36] you made me shut up before,
[203.52] but now I won’t stay quiet.
[208.48] Okay, okay, okay,
[210.16] have patience,
[210.76] everything will be fine.
[211.96] How much more 
patience should I have?
[217.48] Idrees,
[219.20] own me
[221.96] else I know very
 well how to take my right.
[226.76] M…
[247.16] This is a hidden marriage
[249.52] that is impossible to proof.
[251.64] You do have the 
marriage certificate.
[253.28] That is because of me too
[255.20] else you used to say
[256.60] what is the need of all this paperwork,
[258.88] this is useless.
[260.28] Okay, I am sorry,
[262.52] forgive me.
[263.72] Okay do one thing,
[265.48] keep this cheque worth 200k
[266.88] and go shop whatever you want,
[268.64] yeah?
[272.36] These are less.
[273.64] So you will get more.
[276.48] Idrees, I am not talking 
about money,
[280.00] I.....,
[282.08] I don’t want to keep our 
marriage hidden now.
[284.60] Did Arooj teach you this?
[287.08] First promise me you 
will stay away from her.
[289.72] And no one should find 
out this new address,
[291.60] and you will get a new number too.
[293.52] And in return, I promise you,
[295.12] let me just get this business 
and property once,
[298.12] then I will get rid of Shaista
[300.20] and it will just be me and you.
[317.84] Leave me.
[318.20] Come, let’s go, come.
[319.68] Leave me. Idrees, leave me.
[321.44] Listen, I am still asking you
[322.84] to go away from here.
[323.96] Where should I go?
[324.76] To the same house 
I bought for you,
[326.48] I will come and meet you there.
[328.04] I am present here,
[329.32] meet me here only.
[330.24] Why are you being stubborn?
[331.36] We are spending a good life.
[333.16] We?
[334.32] Not we,
[335.28] just you and your first wife,
[337.40] you have side lined me.
[339.64] I am telling you 
I will fix everything,
[341.20] trust me.
[341.88] Enough!
[342.88] Enough Idrees,
[343.92] I don’t trust your lies and
 false promises anymore now,
[348.00] I need the respect for our 
relationship in this society.
[350.64] So now you have announced,
[351.92] stop now and go.
[353.20] Why should I leave?
[354.96] I won’t go away from here,
[356.52] I am your wife
[357.72] and I want the right of being a wife.
[360.12] Wife?
[361.16] Just keep on living your life quietly else
[362.88] you will have to suffer a lot,
[364.20] you won’t be able to prove
 that we are married.
[393.84] So Mr Idrees,
[395.92] this is your Islamabad?
[403.80] You are living here in Karachi only
[407.24] and I am destroyed in the same city.
[417.48] Idrees, who is this woman?
[422.64] I am asking you,
[424.56] who is she and what 
rubbish is she talking?
[430.80] Idrees doesn’t have
 any other lie to say.
[439.52] I will tell you.
[443.72] I am Idrees’ wife.
[463.60] I am not amongst those wives
[468.72] who will see their 
husband with other woman
[473.28] and will start crying and whining,
[478.40] I have a grown-up son,
[480.80] he will take care of 
all these matters now.
[484.20] Umm Salman?
[489.68] Why are you dragging 
Salman into all this,
[491.76] he has to look after
 a lot of business matters.
[495.16] Why are you panicking?
[500.16] You just said that woman is a liar.
[503.76] Yes, yes, she…
[505.52] So let’s see,
[507.92] Salman is coming
 back from the office.
[515.80] Just pray
[516.96] that woman proves to be a liar.
[525.88] Idrees,
[527.72] own me
[530.44] else I know very 
well how to take my right.
[542.08] I had explained
 everything to Musarrat,
[547.52] she was happy at 
that time but
[553.12] then again the same 
stubborn behavior,
[558.40] her changed behavior
 is making me doubtful that
[560.52] someone is provoking Musarrat.
[565.16] No one is even 
in contact with Musarrat.
[570.40] Yes, but Arooj,
[577.36] but she is fighting
 her own battle right now,
[583.36] she can’t be involved
 in another mission,
[584.88] no.
[589.00] I don’t understand,
 my brain is not working.
[618.76] What is going on?
[623.28] I should inform boss,
[627.48] I should talk to Mr Salman.
[629.64] No,
[632.96] I should tell boss.
[649.40] Boss, do you have time?
[651.96] Nawaz, I am a bit disturbed
[654.00] and worried right now.
[655.56] Yes,
[656.04] I shouldn’t tell you
[657.20] but boss this is very important.
[660.32] What has happened?
[662.88] watch it and tell 
me if it is important or…
[666.04] Tell me what happened?
[667.64] Boss, do you remember
[668.56] a man met an accident
 by Mr Salman’s car?
[673.36] yes, yes, it was 
a very minor accident,
[675.40] Shaista told me.
[676.36] look at this,
[678.44] the guy’s bike came,
[681.08] Mr Salman’s car came and hit it.
[689.20] Here they are having 
a heated argument ,
[692.04] and look Madam Arooj comes,
[693.96] lifts her hand to slap 
Mr Salman, and stops.
[698.88] This is the same man
[700.32] who came to meet Mr Salman and
[701.60] Mr Salman refused to meet him.
[705.04] Boss, do you have any idea,
[706.32] how madam Arooj…
[708.12] Delete this video from
 our security computer
[715.60] and from this mobile too,
[717.76] it clearly shows that
[719.60] Salman has on purpose 
tried to hit Shoib with his car.
[723.32] Boss how do you know
 the name of this man?
[726.84] Don’t talk nonsense,
[728.12] delete the video,
[728.96] Salman can get into
 trouble because of this.
[730.72] Boss, it can be deleted from here,
[732.16] but there are CCTV cameras in
 the other buildings in the surrounding.
[735.56] We will think about this,
[736.36] we will think about this too.
[738.56] Go.
[739.04] Okay boss.
[758.60] Taking Areej back 
will cost you a lot.
[761.76] I am not a business 
person like you all
[764.36] that I would calculate 
what costs me a lot or cheaper.
[767.00] I am a mother.
[768.44] if you take Areej from here,
[770.04] you will have to 
suffer a lot of damage.
[772.72] I will divorce you.
[774.12] Do what you want to do,
[778.28] I am not scared of anything now,
[782.56] I will take my daughter from here.
[785.36] I will see how…
[786.00] No, no, son…
What is all this going on?
[788.44] Idrees,
[789.28] Arooj has created this drama,
[792.12] she slapped Salman.
[794.20] Shaista, Salman,
[796.68] you guys go to your room.
[798.16] But she is taking Areej with her.
[800.28] I am telling you to go to your room.
[804.08] Dad, I won’t leave her.
[806.92] Salman, go,
[809.56] go to your room.
[810.92] Okay, come son, come.
[872.96] This is a very special video.
[882.80] Madam Arooj, Mr Salman,
[884.52] at one place, face-to-face.
[891.12] I will have to find out.
[962.04] I have spoken to the 
brother of my friend,
[965.52] he is a lawyer.
[967.04] okay, what did he say?
[971.32] He says that
[974.56] we should only file those cases
 on Salman and his family
[983.44] where we have doubts that
[984.88] Salman and 
Mr Idrees are involved.
[989.40] But your purpose is different.
[993.84] That’s true but
[995.60] the advocate says that for now,
[996.92] we should keep them 
occupied in cases.
[1002.28] For example, which case?
[1005.20] in the case of an attempt to murder,
[1007.56] your car was hit.
[1009.48] This is all rubbish.
[1018.88] Talk to the point,
[1020.96] ask the lawyer to 
not complicate this case.
[1037.84] Hmm,
[1039.88] you are absolutely right,
[1043.16] I will teach them a lesson in court.
[1046.96] I wish
[1048.92] that God put mercy in their 
hearts before it gets to the court
[1056.12] and that they stop doing all this.
[1092.32] You are in so much peace,
[1095.08] I am not liking it at all.
[1098.04] The slap you had 
put across my face,
[1100.88] you will find the marks 
of it on your existence.
[1109.00] She is my daughter.
[1110.00] Salman, my child, sit down.
[1110.60] Leave her.
[1111.60] And I won’t let you raise her.
[1113.28] I am asking you to leave her.
[1113.84] Give her to me.
[1114.48] Leave her.
[1115.40] She is my daughter leave her.
[1120.08] My child, you shouldn’t do this.
[1122.80] We can sit and talk, come.
[1126.96] The time to sit and
 talk has gone.
[1129.64] Leave her, I cannot
 live without her.
[1131.24] Why can’t you?
[1133.44] Didn’t you live
 without your mother?
[1137.36] She is my daughter 
she will live with me.
[1139.12] You can't do this.
[1140.24] Salman, stop, Salman?
[1187.84] the guy’s bike came,
[1190.20] Mr Salman’s car came and hit it.
[1193.48] Here they are having 
a heated argument
[1196.28] and look
[1197.24] Madam Arooj comes,
[1198.16] lifts her hand to slap 
Mr Salman, and stops.
[1203.28] This is the same man
[1204.56] who came to meet
[1205.80] Mr Salman and Mr Salman
 refused to meet him.
[1209.12] Boss, do you have any idea,
[1210.48] how madam Arooj…
[1212.36] Delete this video from 
our security computer
[1219.88] and from this mobile too,
[1222.00] it clearly shows that
[1223.88] Salman has on purpose
 tried to hit Shoaib with his car.
[1227.60] Boss how do you know
 the name of this man?
[1230.96] Don’t talk nonsense,
[1232.40] delete the video,
[1233.36] Salman can get into 
trouble because of this.
[1235.00] Boss, it can be
 deleted from here, but
[1236.36] there are CCTV cameras in
 the other buildings in the surrounding.
[1250.84] Salman is such a fool,
[1257.04] thank God nothing 
happened to Shoaib
[1258.84] else the whole game 
would have been flopped.
[1264.00] I don’t know who is 
giving him these foolish advices.
[1287.32] Nawaz, immediately
 come to my room,
[1289.12] hurry up.
[1314.20] Yes, boss? Did you call me?
[1315.88] Before deleting that footage,
[1317.44] first show it to Salman
[1318.48] as to what mistake he has made.
[1320.00] But boss, Mr Salman 
is not in the office.
[1322.32] Why? Where is he?
 Where did he go?
[1324.68] He just gets up and leaves
 at anytime these days,
[1326.72] he never tells.
[1330.52] okay fine,
[1332.36] we cannot wait for Salman,
[1333.84] delete it
[1338.88] and don’t talk about that 
video in front of anyone.
[1341.76] Yes boss.
[1372.88] Look son,
[1373.88] how she is misbehav…
[1374.64] Be careful while talking 
to my mom next time.
[1378.20] Look here, you…
[1379.00] Salman? Salman?
[1380.64] Don’t you have 
any manners to talk?
[1383.28] I will throw you out of this house.
[1384.36] Salman? Salman? No.
[1385.88] Leave me, Dad.
[1386.40] No, no.
[1387.16] Why are you stopping him?
[1388.92] What will you do to me? Yeah?
[1392.64] Why did you stop?
[1393.96] What do you think
[1395.36] I will get scared of all this.
[1400.64] I am not scared of anyone,
[1402.52] listen to this very carefully.
[1404.24] Shut up!
[1406.72] I will just throw you out of here.
[1408.96] This is mine and 
my mother’s house,
[1417.20] one can throw us out of here,
[1419.56] do you guys understand?
[1421.12] Listen to this very carefully.
[1423.20] This is mine and
 my mother’s house.
[1476.96] Salman, this cannot be expected 
from an educated boy like you.
[1486.40] What happened?
[1487.44] Why are you getting so angry?
[1488.64] You shut up,
[1489.44] why didn’t you tell
 me his car met an accident?
[1500.52] I did tell you.
[1502.56] Don’t act smart,
[1503.52] you did not tell me 
who did it happen with
[1505.16] and I am sure you
 knew it as well.
[1512.44] Will you keep on getting angry
[1513.52] or will you even tell what’s wrong?
[1515.08] You hit Master Shoaib with your car.
[1525.84] Who told you?
[1527.64] The CCTV footage.
[1538.60] It is clearly shown in the CCTV 
cameras of our company
[1540.68] that you have made an attempt 
to murder Shoaib with your car.
[1557.48] Tell me,
[1559.24] will there be a problem?
[1560.48] Not yet
[1561.40] but if someone gets this video,
[1563.36] the career of business tycoon
 Salman will be destroyed.
[1575.76] So then do one thing,
[1577.24] get that footage deleted.
[1584.92] I have
[1586.00] but what should 
I do about the cameras of the...
[1587.32] ... other companies that 
are installed there?
[1593.68] please do something.
[1595.08] Both of you do something since
[1596.24] you both are very smart.
[1612.32] I even asked you 
guys to do as I say
[1614.48] but you guys were in a rush.
[1624.76] What you were doing 
wouldn’t even kill the target
[1626.96] and break the stick.
[1632.36] Now do as I say,
[1634.36] don’t even think of 
doing anything more,
[1637.60] both of you.
[1686.52] He got away again.
[1688.12] Who?
[1690.16] The same,
[1691.72] Master Shoaib,
[1696.92] he came to my office today,
[1699.52] I hit his bike with my car.
[1703.12] Then?
[1705.64] Then what?
[1707.60] The old man survived.
[1710.08] Salman, what are you doing son?
[1715.68] Don’t do all this,
[1717.28] you will get in trouble by all this.
[1719.24] For God’s sake, Mom,
[1721.88] it was a minor accident,
[1723.20] what else?
[1729.04] And by the way,
[1732.04] I am just fed up of this family,
[1738.92] I won’t be at peace till I kill all of them.
[1763.20] What should I do Nasir?
[1764.88] I cannot tolerate it.
[1766.60] You are the limit, Salman,
[1769.32] despite knowing 
everything, you did this.
[1776.80] No matter what you say,
[1779.16] it is an attempt to murder.
[1780.84] So what else would I do?
[1783.16] I hate anyone 
who disrupts my life.
[1786.96] You have mentally become numb,
[1793.76] the decision-making power
 weakens in this situation.
[1798.24] So the you tell me
[1799.36] what should I do?
[1801.64] Ask this to yourself.
[1808.76] Keep hate and emotions aside,
[1810.72] and then look for an answer
[1812.84] and then accept that answer.
[1816.24] You easily said it,
[1818.96] but it is very difficult to do it.
[1823.24] You find it difficult, right?
[1825.64] Then opt for an easy way,
[1827.76] keep on making a mistake
 and destroy yourself.
[1838.72] I know you,
[1840.16] I know you very well,
[1842.60] you are very stubborn.
[1856.16] You will do what you want to do,
[1858.52] then go and continue doing it,
[1859.88] it doesn’t make any
 difference to me, okay?
[1861.72] bye.
[1936.44] Tea.
[1946.88] These court matters,
[1950.20] how will they work,
[1952.56] have you thought of it?
[1954.28] What do you mean
 by how will it work?
[1957.28] They say
[1959.20] if you want to go
 the court and hospital,
[1962.76] you shouldn’t take 
money in pockets
[1965.52] but shopping bags.
[1970.12] Now where will we get 
so much money from, Master?
[1973.84] God will create a way.
[1976.84] God make every way,
[1979.68] now you have such little pension,
[1983.64] our family members
 have increased too,
[1986.04] 3 people have increased.
[1989.12] Why 3?
[1990.88] Areej is very little right now.
[1997.64] Areej’s expenses are the highest.
[2006.68] Her milk is very expensive,
[2010.76] a Rs 5000 packet ends in 5 days.
