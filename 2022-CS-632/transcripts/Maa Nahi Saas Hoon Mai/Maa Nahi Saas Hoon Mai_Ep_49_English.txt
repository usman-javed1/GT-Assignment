Salman? What happened? What Is It? 
Why Is your mood off? What Is It, son? 
Tell me? What should I tell you? What do I even have to tell you? I fix one thing the other one 
gets ruined; someone gets upset and then 
the other one gets upset. I can understand, son, your life Is difficult, but what has happened now? 
At this exact moment? Whatever happens every day and the sad part Is, nothing 
even gets better. Mom says something and 
Arooj says something else, and when I make them confront 
each other, there Is a battle, I don’t understand who should 
I listen to and who I shouldn’t. Who do you want to listen to? I don’t want to listen to anyone, I just want to listen to what’s right and what I can understand. And who do you think Is right 
out of both of them? I don’t know. Mom says that Arooj has 
misbehaved with me and when I ask Arooj, 
she says I don’t know anything, you tell me what should I do? If Arooj has said so, then she is right. And mom? She Is lying? No, she Is not lying, Mehreen’s problem is that she doesn’t remember what has 
she said to someone and when. So that Is confusing me, I have been stuck between them,
 what should I do? Whatever is going on, don’t take all these things 
on your nerves. Okay? You are going to the office, 
right? Go. Bye. Bye. What Is this problem? Mehreen’s madness has put 
everyone’s life in trouble. Why don’t you say that you have 
some problem with mom and you just didn’t come 
to the breakfast table so you don’t get to meet Mom and I don’t get to find out the reality? What reality? You have misbehaved with mom, 
right? I? 
Don’t lie to me, she has spent the entire night 
in the lounge, she was very tensed. What have I even said to her? What did she even say to you? She just asked you how was 
your dinner with Salman. How did your time go? She didn’t ask me anything like that,
You are lying. My happiness, my happiness is so temporary, very non-durable, I guess happiness and peace have slipped out of my palms 
and fallen somewhere. And Salman, Salman’s tongue has started 
to blow fire. Salman is worried there and I see you crying here, what is this joke? my life has become a joke, aunt, I just get one moment of happiness 
and then I spend so many days in grief. What is all this? my child, I have always supported you, right? I know what you are saying is true and correct. But Salman Is not ready to accept 
anything that I say as true or correct. According to you, Salman just listens to Mehreen, yeah? So, my child, why are you making 
yourself worried by thinking this? Because I cannot get away 
this thought from myself. Why? Aunt Mehreen has been 
pushing me in a marsh, even after trying to put in 
a lot of effort, I have been getting stuck deeper 
in that marsh, what should I do? Look my child, will you listen to me If I give you 
a suggestion? You stop trying to put
in these efforts and just get silent. How can I just get silent, Aunt? Aunt Mehreen even provokes 
the walls to speak up. Mehreen does wrong with everyone. I consider Mehreen a mental patient, 
my child, you will be at peace 
if you accept that too. Even Salman got upset 
with me and left, his entire day will be ruined. Don’t worry, I have listened to everything
that Salman had to say, and I have comforted him 
and sent him. Do you know, Aunt, you take care of Salman like a mother, care about him. Okay get up and wash your face,
 good girl, go and get freshen up. 
Get up, good girl. Go. Because, my love, Salman is not Mehreen’s son but mine, mine. And look at my ill fate, I cannot tell this to anyone 
even if I want to. I cannot tell this to anyone. I feel like screaming and telling It 
to everyone that Salman Is my son, my son, Not Mehreen’s, but… She is a very strange woman, she has complicated the entire home and made Arooj fed up as well By the way, our daughter is not 
the one who gets fed up, such hot and cold things happen
 in every house, you must not worry. I am thinking of calling her at 
my place for a few days, she will be relaxed. You have decided yourself that
 Arooj is in tension and she will come and stay 
with you for a few days, she is someone’s daughter-In-law now and after that she is your daughter. Mr. Master doesn’t even listen to me; it is not possible for a daughter-In-law to stay happy 
with a mother-In-law like Mehreen. Wives’ fate is like lotto, it’s good if your name comes up else all your savings go to waste. How do mothers get to know that their daughters are worried? Greetings, mom. Greetings. How are you, Arooj, my child? I am fine mom, 
are you and dad well? Yes, we are absolutely fine, we are just worried for you. What will happen to me, mom, 
I am very happy. I didn’t ask you if my daughter Arooj is happy or not. What does that mean, mom? It simply means that I know. You know what? What you know as well and are hiding it from your mother. I know, my child, you are not happy at all. Mom, Salman is my courage. Trust me, Arooj has misbehaved so much 
with your mother. But what was the reason to 
behave like that? Arooj doesn’t need any reason 
to fight with me, Salman. I just asked her how was your dinner, her tone showed that I didn’t have
 any right to ask her. You know that I have never even 
spoken to Wasai in this tone, and I, why does she? Why does she forget that 
I am your mother? Okay don’t worry, I will talk to her. No, don’t talk to her at all, you will go to the office and then she will say wrong things 
to me later again. Don’t talk to her at all. What did she even say to you? She just asked you how was 
your dinner with Salman. How did your time go? She didn’t ask me anything like that, You are lying. You call me a liar she calls me 
a magician; she says that I have trapped you 
in love with me and you are getting distant 
from her. What is this tone 
you are talking to me in? Have you seen your tone 
and your voice? It is very strange that one should even get hurt and
there shouldn’t be any noise? And what about how you have 
hurt mom’s sentiments? I am not responsible for it. Then who is responsible? Yeah? She herself is responsible because 
she assumes everything on her own, like you, you made me stand 
in the court, you question and I answer because I am your culprit and that is because I love you. Who do you want to listen to? 
I don’t want to listen to anyone, I just want to listen to what’s right and what I can understand. And who do you think is right 
out of both of them? I don’t know. Mom says that Arooj has 
misbehaved with me and when I ask Arooj, 
she says I don’t know anything, you tell me what should I do? If Arooj has said so, then she is right. I have heard enough praises 
of Salman from you, but you live with your mother-in-law 
Mehreen all day, tell me how she treats you? Don’t hide, my child, Arooj, please at least tell your mother. What do you think
how her behavior must be? Like it is between a mother 
and a daughter. What fantasies are you talking
 about, mom? A mother-In-law can 
never be a mother. No, my child, she can definitely be. How can you be so sure? You are not a mother-in-law; 
you are a mother. Yes, I am just a mother, okay just leave it, tell me how Is Sister Shaista’s behaviour 
with you? Arooj, my child, she loves you right? Yes, yes, she Is very nice, she takes so much care of me but she said a very strange thing 
to me today. About what? About you? About Aunt Mehreen. What Is It? According to her I should ignore 
what Aunt Mehreen says, she is a mental patient. No, no my child, 
you must not say that. But mom, how can you live with 
a mental patient? She… Aunt actually… So, I am a mental patient? I am mad, I get seizures… No aunt, actually… Shut the hell up! Whom were you telling 
I am a mental patient? Umm I was talking to mom. Like mother like daughter. Such mothers give birth 
to daughters like you. Aunt please don’t say anything about my mom. Really? I am someone’s mother too, you can say whatever you want 
about me, you can even call me mad? No, no, It’s not that aunt, 
actually… Now whatever it is, this will be decided. I am sorry. Aunt, please I… Hello? Mom? Now there Is nothing to hide 
from you, Mom, you know everything now. She is like that. I was even telling you. Hello? Mom? Why aren’t you talking? Mom? The phone is still connected. 
Mom? Naseema? Nasee… Naseema? Naseema? Naseema? Hey, Naseema? Naseema? Naseema? Let me get water. Aunt, Aunt… What happened, my child?
is everything okay? Aunt, mom. Relax what has happened? I was talking to mom in call, all of a sudden mom’s voice
 stopped coming though the call was still connected 
but there was no response. So, what Is there to worry about? It must be a network Issue. There is no issue, I am very scared, 
I am very tensed, Aunt. Okay, okay don’t worry, 
call your dad and ask. Dad? No, I am scared, you know there must be something
else this has never happened. Hey there must be nothing 
that is why I am asking you to call your dad and 
ask so you are satisfied. Aunt I am scared; I won’t be able to talk. Okay, do one thing, dial your dad’s number and 
I will talk to him. Give. Relax. Fool. The call is ringing but Mr. Master 
Is not attending the call. I told you something has happened else it never happens that 
no one picks up the call. There must be nothing, 
everything will be fine, If God wills and wait and watch your dad will 
call you himself. Don’t worry. Go. This girl has a heart like a bird. Careful Naseema, have courage. That’s it, nothing, it’s done, 
it’s done, we are here, come, sit, come sit here. Sit. I told your condition to the doctor he asked me to bring you 
to the hospital, let the neighbor’s boy bring 
the rickshaw, you just need to make an effort. Master, the rickshaw is here. Okay, okay, come, come Naseema, 
get up, get up. Get up. Careful, careful, that’s it, that’s it, just put in efforts to get 
to the rickshaw. Hey nothing will happen. 
Careful. Hello? Hello, dad? You were not attending my call, mom’s phone was not even 
going through, is mom well? Yes, daughter, your mom is 
absolutely fine now. What do you mean by now?
What happened to mom? I don’t know I guess 
she was talking to you, all of a sudden, 
she got dizzy and fell, thank God I came in time 
and brought her to the hospital. Hospital? Make me talk to mom. She is in the room right now; I am going to pay the bill 
we will go home then. Don’t worry, your mom 
Is absolutely fine. How can I not worry? I am coming to meet mom; 
I won’t be satisfied unless I see her. Okay fine, we are going home and you can come home then 
and don’t worry at all. Okay fine I am coming. Bye. Bye. What does dad know what happened on call. I was tolerating the shocks given 
by Aunt Mehreen until now, but now this has gotten to my mom. who do I have in this world 
except my mom and Dad? My purse. Wasai, my purse Is left upstairs, I want to go to my mom, 
she Is not well. May God make things well. 
Bring It. I will bring It. Aunt, Aunt, I told you that something was wrong,
something was not right, and what I was being scared 
of has happened. Oh God, I hope everything Is well, 
what happened, my child? Aunt, mom fainted. What? How Is your mom now? She has come back from 
the hospital now but I will get to know It properly once 
I go there that what has happened to her. okay, okay my child don’t worry, but I don’t understand that how did Sister Naseema faint. Because of Aunt Mehreen. What do you mean 
by Aunt Mehreen? Because I had told everyone that 
I am very happy at my in laws’ house, my mom doesn’t know the kind 
of days I am spending here, when Mom called me 
in the morning today, I was talking to her and then 
Aunt Mehreen came all of a sudden and started shouting on me, she said whatever she felt like 
and mom heard every word, now just Imagine what else would have
happened to her If she wouldn’t faint. That’s it my child, 
that’s it, don’t worry, do one thing, you Immediately 
go to your mom’s house, even ask her from my side and call Salman when 
you are on way, okay? Leave immediately, go. Oh God keep everything well. yes. Where are you going? With your bag like this? I am asking you something. I am going to see my mom. Have you never seen your mother 
ever before? She fainted. So, she must have been dizzied. You just need an excuse to go to her and she needs an excuse to call you. It Is not an excuse, Aunt. She fainted, she has just come back 
from the hospital and all this is because of you. Shut up, do you even know 
what you are saying? I know very well what I am saying. Do you know I had made an image of you 
in front of Mom and you destroyed that image today, my mom’s patience is destroyed too, she heard everything today. I don’t care if she hears, 
I am not scared of your mother. You can at least respect her; she is my mom. She is not some unusual mother. My mom is everything for me and don’t even say a word against 
her ever again. Now the decision will be made If your mother is Important 
for you or Salman’s.
