Hello How are you, Salman? I am fine, how are you, Basit? The thing to tell is, the shooter who attacked you, we have traced him. We raided him 
but he escaped. So what is the point of 
telling all of this? This is not as simple as 
you are thinking it to be, Salman. Those boys are hired hitters and they have a criminal record. What do you mean? It means someone else is your enemy, who gave them money to kill you. Now you tell me, whom do you doubt it to be? So that I can catch them, otherwise there can be another 
attack on you. Yes, but I have no enmity 
with anyone, then who could it be? Anyway, you should carry on 
with your inquiry. By the way, Salman, 
my experience tells me that the one who called this attack
on you is someone close to you, who knew that 
we were about to raid. Someone informed them on time and they escaped. When you can catch the shooters,
 see who was behind it, and inform me as well. Okay, I will inform you. Wasai! Wasai! Yes, coming Young Madam. Wasai, where is Mom? She must be in her room. She is not in her room! Do one thing, 
you look in the store, I will check the lawn.
Yes. Elder Madam! Elder Madam! Young Madam! Young Madam! Mom, Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, open your eyes, Mom! Mom, what happened? Wasai, bring water, 
go quickly! Mom! Mom, open your eyes. Mom, what happened? Wasai! Wasai, 
come quickly. Mom! Whatever you told me about her, how her memory is coming back, 
it is really amazing! She is remembering her past, without any mental damage, this rarely happens. But Doctor, she is getting weaker day by day. She gets sudden headaches and they are so severe, 
that I get scared. The cells were inactive 
for a long time. It takes time, and one experiences shocks as well. Okay, it means you're saying her memory
 is coming back. Then, Doctor, how much time 
will it take for her memory to recover 
completely? It’s in front of you. Nothing happened in years. She is getting better. 
Hope for the best. Yes, I have hope for the best, I just want to keep my mother happy. She has faced a lot of traumas, I want to see her happy. You take care of her. 
Everything will get better. I will take my leave now. Salman, son! Salman, son, 
where were you? I have been calling you 
for a while, you were not picking up your phone,
I got so worried. There is no need for you 
to get worried. How are you talking to me? I am not a child, that will get lost. You answer me, am I a weak child that someone 
will hand over to somebody else and be unconcerned about it? No, no. No, no, child. I know what you are trying to say, but I was never unconcerned 
about you! Stop it! Don't say anything else. If this is not called being unconcerned,
then what else do we call it? What are you looking 
at over there? Salman went away. He didn’t go anywhere, he got a huge mental shock, 
he will come back. He will not come back, and this is karma. What do you mean, huh? 
What are you trying to say? You separated me from my Mom, today your own son left you! No, my son is in front of me. Yes, he is in front of you and you want to hug him as well, but he doesn’t even want 
to see your face! I will handle all of that. What are you being 
so happy about, huh? Because it is my turn 
to be happy now. Arooj! My son, he is going through so much pain! Everything will be fine. How will it get better? I am telling you, one day I will burst out, my patience is wearing thin! Then go, go and tell him! Imagine, when Salman 
comes to know that you are his real mother, 
he will start hating you so much, that you gave him away to Mehreen, just for money! Not for money, but to save Mehreen’s life. Fool everyone, but not me and yourself, Shaista. There are two enemies of us,
in our home. One is Arooj and the other is Mehreen. Now, we should do this, we should tell Mehreen that 
Salman is not hers but our son. What will happen from all of this? She will go mad from the shock. But our target is Arooj, who has the entire business 
in her name. It is necessary to defeat Arooj’s luck. We don’t have time. That’s why we will have 
to change the plan. No, no, think of something else. And keep in mind that 
the wind is against us, any carelessness will throw us 
to a new place. Remember this. Oh, why did you come? You were told to rest. I am fine, Salman didn’t come back yet? Yes… You have a long life, what happened Salman, Son? Don’t call me your ‘son’! Salman, lower your voice, she is your mom.
Quiet! No one will speak, especially not a lie! I have come to know 
about everything. I have seen my birth certificate. It must be wrong. Nothing is wrong, it was not a lie. The lie is, what has been shown 
to me as the truth for so many years! I am telling you, I am not your son, nor you’re my mom! Never call me your son ever again. He was lying right? He, has he gone mad? He was saying that 
I am not his mother! He is lying, he is absolutely lying! Stupid boy! Idiot, I am not his mom? This is the truth, and it is just half of the truth. I will show you the whole truth. Everyone is going mad! Everyone has gone mad, he is not my son? Greetings. Greetings, where is my son going all dressed up? Let me shower you with love quickly, otherwise, if Mehreen sees it 
then she will raise hell. Hardly anyone on earth would 
have a mother like mine. The home has become so lively 
since your bride arrived. Before she came, there used to be 
a weird silence in this house. I was just going to get that life. Really? Then quickly go and come back. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Salman, Oh God, what happened to my son?
 Are you alright? Salman is not your son, 
he is my son! Salman, did something happen
to you? Are you alright? I am fine, Mom. Thank you, God! There is no need for you to worry
this much about Salman, stop it for God’s sake. What did I say wrong? I just called him ‘Son’ It is wrong for someone else to 
call Salman ‘son’, except me. For God’s sake, please. Stop it. Both of you are always 
arguing about me! Salman
Mom, please, I am already very late,
I have to go. Oh, dear God! What is this? I am... your daughter, Areej. Here! Look mom. Areej! It is so pretty, Mehreen, look. It is a very pretty name. So, you gave her a name 
of your liking, right? Yes, because Areej is a very pretty name. Right, Mom? Yes, it is a very pretty name. Now our entire home will 
smell of her scent. Here you go Mom, make Areej wear it 
with your own hands. I will remove it. My little doll. Here you go.
