[32.36] Are you still upset with me?
[37.44] I am not upset.
[41.64] I am sad.
[47.52] Meaning, you are saying that
[51.00] I have given you sorrow.
[58.36] Are you asking me a question 
or accepting it?
[64.56] If it is a question, then,
[67.64] what will be your answer?
[72.52] Yes.
[76.64] You have given me sorrow.
[86.64] If the reports had not come in,
[90.80] then you would have gotten married.
[93.36] Arooj, don’t forget I had refused
 on every step.
[100.64] You stepped forward yourself and 
gave mom permission.
[106.24] What else could I do?
[109.88] You should have done the same,
[112.32] refused it.
[116.32] I thought that
[119.00] your refusal has no worth in front of 
aunt Mehreen.
[124.12] Arooj, I had the final decision of accepting 
or rejecting Alizeh in my hands.
[134.56] Anyway, I…
[139.96] I want to forget everything.
[148.16] But I will always remember one thing.
[153.68] I have been insulted badly 
because of aunt Mehreen.
[158.44] I got humiliated a lot because of her.
[187.32] I made a mistake.
[190.76] I realize this.
[212.24] If you want, you can forgive me
[215.00] or if you want, you can punish me.
[220.80] I accept.
[303.92] Speak up,
[305.36] what have you come to say?
[309.92] Do you even know that someone is hurt 
because of your stubbornness,
[313.40] someone’s heart has been hurt.
[314.84] I never hurt anyone’s heart.
[317.76] Now tell me, 
what do you want to say?
[319.28] For God’s sake, mom,
[321.04] I would still have to tell you 
what I came to talk about?
[324.36] If you find it reasonable, 
then tell me.
[327.00] Then listen,
[329.56] Arooj is really hurt because of 
what you did with her.
[333.64] Oh,
[335.32] so you came here to talk 
in favour of your wife.
[340.64] I didn’t come to talk in her favour.
[344.84] I am just telling you that 
whatever has happened,
[347.48] after this, at least you can go to Arooj 
and console her.
[350.68] You an do this, right?
[352.24] When I have not done anything, then 
why should go and apologize to Arooj?
[356.52] When did I ask you to apologize?
[358.48] You didn’t make it evident, 
but this is what you said.
[364.44] You want that your mother 
in this age goes
[367.52] and begs forgiveness from a girl 
who recently came.
[370.44] I never said anything like that.
[373.20] I am just saying that you can at least 
you can go and hug her with love.
[378.32] What I have not done anything, 
when I have no fault,
[381.48] then why should I go to her?
[383.76] All this Alizeh’s doing and 
she too is your friend. Right?
[389.56] So why should I go to that Arooj,
to apologize?
[394.40] Apologize.
[398.08] I will go mad.
[404.60] Alizeh.
[428.24] You must be really surprised 
seeing me in your room.
[435.64] You should be surprised too,
[438.28] because I try my best to not even
step in your room.
[446.48] Now how do I respond to that?
[450.80] You shouldn’t respond either.
[454.92] You sent Salman as your lawyer 
in front of me, right?
[459.12] No, I didn't.
[462.72] He stood in front of me
[465.24] and you are saying you didn’t do that.
[471.36] Hear me out clearly, Arooj,
[476.92] I will never apologize to you.
[481.56] I never wanted that 
you apologize to me.
[485.36] You want this,
[488.56] that is why Salman said this to me.
[495.84] But, I am surprised at what my fault is
[502.40] that I should apologize to you for?
[514.48] You don’t say sorry to me at all,
[517.48] you are like my mother.
[521.12] Mother?
[523.76] I cannot be your mother at all.
[529.36] I am just the mother of my Salman.
[593.28] This is not something about a day or two,
[597.84] I have been seeing Mehreen for years,
[601.36] she will never realize her mistakes.
[604.56] She will only do what she wants.
[611.84] What can we say?
[618.80] I become helpless in front of 
mom’s insistence.
[621.44] That’s why I am saying don’t tire yourself.
[629.00] Aunt, you have seen how much 
I have changed myself.
[634.20] I only become quiet for the sake of 
the environment of this home.
[638.88] I know,
[640.80] or else you were more stubborn
then Mehreen.
[644.52] So what is the point of this change?
[646.68] It made no difference.
[650.64] Arooj has been mistreated.
[654.40] Mistreated?
[656.28] And this mistreatment is only 
cause of mom’s insistence.
[659.04] So you do something that 
she forgets this incident.
[662.08] What do I do?
[675.08] I think you take Arooj and 
go abroad for a few days.
[695.48] Good idea.
[697.72] You are right.
[699.00] This way you two will get change as well 
and you will become fresh.
[707.04] Son, you only get life once,
[710.52] and in this once you have find 
happiness again and again.
[766.36] Sir, you called me?
[768.48] Yes, Mr. Irfan, this is mine 
and my wife’s passport,
[771.92] so you send this to the travel agent.
[773.80] Okay sir.
[776.60] Are you going somewhere with madam?
[779.44] It is a trip to Dubai.
[782.00] Great. Sir, will you tell me the dates?
[785.28] Everything is mentioned in it,
kindly send it.
[788.64] Okay, sir.
[789.80] Thank you.
[816.76] What is the matter? 
You are smiling a lot.
[820.44] It is something like that.
[821.76] When you hear it, 
you too will smile.
[824.12] Then tell me quickly,
[825.52] because it has been a long time 
that I laughed.
[828.20] So the thing is that we are going 
to Dubai for vacations.
[834.24] Really?
[835.20] Absolutely.
[839.12] So, finally…
[841.96] finally, I will get a chance 
to breath freely with you.
[847.16] We will get a chance to spend
time with you.
[850.28] You know,
[852.60] we do live together,
[854.96] but we never got free time.
[859.16] Yes.
[861.08] But Salman, I will tell you one thing,
[863.56] whether Dubai or any other country,
no business, please.
[867.08] Alright. Promise.
[868.84] No business. I will go and get fresh.
[911.44] Everything will be really beautiful.
[917.52] Freedom and carefree moments.
[926.80] Only Salman and I.
[935.72] The two of us will get a chance 
to meet each other.
[939.72] I am happy just thinking about it.
[969.08] I have a good news.
[971.20] Really? Then tell me quickly.
[973.96] I will tell you. I will tell you.
[977.24] Salman and I are going abroad 
for a trip.
[979.92] Oh my God. Congratulations.
Great.
[983.64] But isn’t this honeymoon a little late?
[986.44] So? What problem do you have?
[990.60] I have no issues, I am jealous.
[994.08] So, why are you jealous, stupid? 
Get married.
[998.36] Yes, but for that I should get 
a good boy, who likes me.
[1003.16] Not just a good boy,
[1008.32] even the mother of the child 
should be good.
[1011.08] Yes, if I get a mother-in-law like you,
I will go mad.
[1016.60] What do I say, man? 
Anyway, leave it.
[1019.24] Tell me, what do I get for you?
[1021.64] I will shop one day before coming.
[1046.92] Salman, the tickets for you 
and Urooj are here.
[1049.56] Check the meeting schedule once.
[1051.36] Your flight has been booked 
for two days later.
[1053.76] Thank you.
[1060.20] Where are you two going?
[1062.60] Mom, Arooj and I are going to Dubai.
[1067.32] Hmmm.
[1068.72] You two are going abroad and 
I don’t even know.
[1078.68] Mom, I just told you that the two of us 
are going abroad.
[1082.20] I am not talking about informing me, 
I am talking about permission.
[1087.40] Even your manager would know this,
and I am your mother.
[1091.04] Is there no worth of seeking my permission
 in your eyes?
[1106.08] Mehreen,
[1108.60] there is no reason to react 
so much in this.
[1111.60] Salman, just told you that 
these two are going for an outing.
[1117.48] No sister-in-law Shaista, 
there is a need.
[1120.12] This action of Salman is going
against my upbringing.
[1123.12] I have taught him all the rules of life.
[1126.40] Today, I cannot tolerate his 
unruly behaviour today.
[1131.04] Mom, what are you saying?
[1134.92] What did I not do in your obedience?
[1141.44] You create an issue out of everything, 
and nothing else.
[1146.36] Really?
[1148.28] You mean to say that 
I am responsible.
[1153.64] I didn’t say that.
[1155.12] You didn’t say that,
[1156.92] but I will surely say that 
you were not like this earlier.
[1170.44] All this has been done by this Arooj.
[1175.72] Mom.
[1259.24] Did you see?
[1262.00] Did you see Mehreen?
[1263.88] See how she made a mountain 
out of a mole hill.
[1269.20] I am seeing her, Shaista. I am seeing it.
[1271.92] For how long?
[1275.28] How long will Mehreen do injustice 
to the children like this?
[1278.68] Why is there no one 
who can question her?
[1280.84] If someone will be in their senses, 
then they will ask questions.
[1283.76] Mehreen’s mental condition doesn’t 
allow her to respond to any questions.
[1288.84] This.
[1290.92] This is the excuse everyone has.
[1296.76] Earlier, she didn’t accept Arooj 
as her daughter-in-law,
[1304.36] after that she made her not being 
able to bear a child,
[1308.36] and doing this injustice.
[1311.20] All this is intolerable, but…
[1313.88] The plan of my children shouldn’t get 
cancelled because of these ifs and buts, Idrees.
[1320.96] She is a weird woman, 
she cannot see anyone happy.
[1325.88] Look Shaista, I have brought the tickets. 
I cannot do anything more than this.
[1329.04] You can at least speak up.
[1331.44] Salman will handle it himself, 
he himself is really stubborn.
[1334.52] When is he stubborn?
[1336.84] He is not stubborn anymore.
[1343.28] My son has changed.
[1346.48] I don’t know what happened to him.
[1350.52] He has started to stay silent.
[1383.40] Mom,
[1384.80] is it necessary that we have a depressed 
environment in this home?
[1390.88] You are telling me that I am responsible
for the depression?
[1396.64] I didn’t say that at all.
[1402.20] You know Salman,
[1404.28] that I am your mother.
I love you dearly.
[1407.40] Mom, I accept this.
[1410.04] I know, no one in the world loves me 
more than you.
[1416.12] Then would I not mind when my son 
doesn’t tell me anything
[1420.36] about what he is doing.
[1422.84] Okay fine, I accept my mistake.
[1427.96] Now I am seeking your permission.
[1430.36] Can I go?
[1432.72] If you are asking for my permission now,
then what is the point?
[1435.00] When I convinced you that
you need to seek permission.
[1442.00] Then you tell me, 
what should I do?
[1446.20] Do nothing and go to sleep.
[1448.72] I am sleepy.
[1450.88] Mom.
[1485.32] Salman.
[1494.84] What happened?
[1496.52] Why do you people have 
such sad faces?
[1498.96] Did Mehreen say something again?
[1511.24] You know,
[1515.56] it is impossible for us to go 
without mama’s permission.
[1519.40] Yes, so son, you went to seek permission,
[1523.00] then what did Mehreen say?
[1530.44] Did she not agree?
[1546.84] You guessed it right, aunt,
[1550.08] she didn’t give us permission.
[1553.60] There is a limit to stubbornness.
[1556.32] That woman doesn’t care about 
anyone’s happiness.
[1560.04] Uncle you do one thing,
[1562.36] ask Nawaz and get our tickets cancelled.
[1565.32] No, no, Idrees, you will not do that.
[1568.20] This will be injustice with the children.
[1570.08] Do anything and send these children.
[1575.84] What can I do, Shaista?
[1577.76] Aunt, try to understand.
[1581.20] If we leave without mama’s permission,
[1583.00] then all hell will break loose in this home.
[1585.08] Nothing will happen.
[1586.84] I will take care of Mehreen.
[1590.28] Aunt, she will fight a lot with you.
[1592.56] She won’t fight. She won’t. My children…
[1604.60] I can tolerate everything for my children.
[1611.76] Arooj, child, you prepare to leave. Pack.
[1616.24] But Mehreen shouldn’t find out 
about this before you leave.
[1623.68] Yes, if she finds out at the last moment, 
she will make a little noise
[1626.48] and then she will get quiet. Okay?
[1629.76] But Shaista…
What, but?
[1631.64] That’s it.
[1633.08] What I had to say, I said it.
[1635.12] This is my decision.
[1661.76] Hear me clearly.
[1665.24] If you want to live in this home, you will 
have to live with my permission,
[1668.84] and before anyone comes and 
goes from this home,
[1671.44] you will seek permission from me.
[1677.08] You understand, right?
[1679.24] I won’t have to make you 
understand again, right?
[1720.48] If you have to go anywhere, 
aunt Mehreen doesn’t like it.
[1728.64] She creates hurdles.
[1735.12] She has made this home a jail for me.
[1739.84] Where all my desires are suffering 
the punishment.
[1745.48] What do I do?
[1747.36] I am so helpless and oppressed.
[1759.96] Madam, should I bring your tea?
[1765.72] What has happened to madam?
[1770.28] I will find out.
[1797.84] Madam, you look worried.
[1802.36] Is everything fine?
[1806.48] This woman wont let my children live.
[1812.52] She is the enemy of their happiness.
[1818.76] The heart of those two poor things 
got broken.
[1822.92] What did Mehreen get ruining 
their happiness?
[1830.76] And
[1833.68] she doesn’t care at all.
[1838.64] How can she do this?
[1842.44] Madam, you don’t cry.
[1845.84] God will make it all fine.
[1849.20] I will make tea and bring it for you.
[1878.56] Shaista you have promised the children 
that you will handle everything,
[1882.04] but how?
[1883.32] Because Idrees, when you have
to console someone’s heart,
[1887.04] you shouldn’t be scared,
[1890.24] and then I am doing all this 
for my son, Salman.
[1894.36] But this conspiracy of yours 
will get caught,
[1898.68] you will not have an answer.
[1900.84] How will you handle Mehreen?
[1902.60] If you think
[1904.52] that taking care of my son’s happiness 
is a bad thing,
[1909.28] or consoling the children 
is a conspiracy,
[1911.56] then let me conspire.
[1914.48] You know Mehreen’s anger and 
her mental condition.
[1917.60] You also know that Mehreen has said 
no to Salman and Arooj.
[1921.88] This way she will lose her mind.
[1923.60] Yes, so when does she not 
lose her mind?
[1926.72] I have heard this all my life that 
something will happen to Mehreen.
[1931.68] I am tired.
[1933.96] Till now, nothing happened to her.
[1935.80] You are being overconfident Shaista.
[1937.44] Because I have good intentions
[1939.32] and I am sure nothing bad will happen.
[1942.60] You don’t worry, that’s it.
[1945.52] Fine, I will go now.
[1982.60] What is all this, Arooj?
[1986.36] I had said no,
[1988.96] still you packed your bags?
[1991.72] No aunty, this was packing from before.
[1994.44] You said no later.
[1997.72] and you didn’t like me saying no, right?
[2002.28] What?
[2006.56] No.
[2008.24] I didn’t say that.
[2011.32] But face clearly tells me that 
I have done injustice with you.
[2016.52] Aunty, I didn’t complain to anyone.
[2019.92] Okay, so you wanted to complain?
[2024.60] Who would you have complained to?
[2037.52] What happened Arooj?
[2039.80] You don’t have an answer, right?
[2044.60] No problem.
[2046.08] But I can read it clearly on your face.
[2050.96] I can tell everything.
[2066.64] You don’t know how to read faces.
[2141.64] Arooj.
[2146.28] What are you thinking?
[2150.12] I want to talk to you.
[2152.24] Will you sit, please?
[2154.24] Yes, tell me.
[2162.12] Are we stealing something?
[2165.48] No. Not at all.
[2167.76] Why did you feel this way?
[2171.16] Then why are we secretly 
making this plan?
[2174.48] I mean, you can talk to aunt, 
you can convince her.
[2178.44] Why can we not go taking her 
into confidence?
[2182.00] We too have a life.
[2185.28] Arooj, I agree to this,
[2187.96] but mom won’t agree,
[2191.56] and I want to take you for this trip 
at all cost.
[2195.08] That’s why I quietly planned this trip.
[2200.08] Fine.
[2201.80] We will go secretly.
[2204.24] Then?
[2205.68] What will happen after that?
[2208.68] Aunty will constantly call
[2211.52] and I will get insulted 
when we come back.
[2214.68] Arooj, not just you,
[2217.60] both of us will get insulted.
[2220.60] She won’t say anything to you, 
she is your mother.
[2224.84] And you know she only loves you.
[2229.40] I am not a shareholder in this love.
[2232.00] And another thing 
that is most important,
[2234.96] she is your mother, 
but my mother-in-law.
[2241.48] Don’t worry.
[2244.24] If mama does anything bad with you,
[2247.64] I am with you.
[2251.04] You will stand by me?
[2253.96] You will go to the office, 
and later on,
[2257.32] I, aunt Mehreen, 
this home and her taunts.
[2260.48] Then you tell me,
what do I do?
[2268.08] Will you agree to what I say?
[2273.28] Obviously. 
Go ahead.
[2279.40] Cancel this trip.
[2296.80] I cancel this trip?
[2301.20] What does this mean?
