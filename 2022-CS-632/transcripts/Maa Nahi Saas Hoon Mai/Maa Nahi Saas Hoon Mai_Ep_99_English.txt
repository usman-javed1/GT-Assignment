Why did you come emptyhanded? Where is the file? Salman, I am asking you. What happened? Did Arooj refuse to sign? She is really cunning, she must have read that
she will lose everything… It is not like that, dad. She was trusting me completely, but that Wasai came at 
the last moment and took her, everything was left incomplete. So… so, now? That Arooj has really good luck. Now I cannot find that file. You cannot find the file? How is that possible? 
You go. Go and search again. 
Go. I have searched all around the home, 
I cannot find it anywhere. I am the owner of this business,
 property, wealth and I have found out about 
this really well. So my advice to you is stop 
dreaming about it. It is just a matter of me 
going to the court. I will ruin your twenty five year plan, in minutes. So, the result of what I said was that stay away from my husband, 
daughter and mother. This is better for you. Salman, I am really happy today. Okay, really? Yes. Every time you look at me with love, I feel I have all the happiness 
in the world. Then fine, I will increase your happiness 
further. The textile mill uncle Waqar thought
 of setting up in your name, now, I will complete that project and it will be in our daughter’s name. Areej Textile. Wow, this is a really good news. Are you happy?
Really happy. You are happy, 
so what else do I need? So, then tell me, how did you like shopping? You are really good. You too are really good. We spent such good time together
after so long. I really liked it. Me too. Now quickly sign this file, so that the work on Areej textile 
starts from tomorrow. Yes, so tell me, 
where do I need to sign? Fine, you do it. Here is the pen. Salman, did you find the documents? No, I searched the whole home.
I didn’t find them anywhere. By the way, Salman, when will you start working 
on Areej textile? Arooj, you sign it today, 
I will work from tomorrow. Yes, so give me the file, 
I will sign it right now. I am unable to find it. I searching 
everywhere. It is nowhere. Oh. That reminds me, when I was signing the documents
and I got up and left, then I felt that I took the documents 
in mama’s room. Maybe, but I am not sure. So, I will do one thing, I will go 
check downstairs. You wait. Sit here comfortably. I will bring it. Thank you, Arooj. I know, mom and dad don’t like you. But I will give you and aunt Mehreen
all the happiness in the world. and your daughter? Is this even something to ask? I will give my life for her. You are a liar. Not just a liar, 
you also show fake love. Arooj! Lower your voice, you showed false love to me. You made a fake apology to mama, and now… you will give your life
for your daughter? I am sure you are lying 
about this too. What did you think? Huh? What did you think?
I will not find out anything. I have read all those papers,
Salman. What will you do? 
Huh? What will you do with this wealth? Is all this more precious 
than selfless love? How did she find out? What happened? 
What are you looking for? Arooj, the file that 
you were signing, it was in my room. 
I cannot find it. Yes, yes, so what happened? 
Where did the file go? I had signed it. Yes, but one paper was left. So, come on, give it, 
I will sign it right away. How will you sign it? If I find it, 
then you will sign it. I have seen the entire home, 
it is nowhere. Hey, so it is our own home, 
it will be somewhere here, we will find it. By the way, I have not seen you so restless 
for anything before today. What happened? 
Was all okay? Did she sign it? Is all okay? What happened? 
Tell me something. Arooj has found out the reality. Now I will not tolerate both 
of them in this home. Salman, try and understand, this way, everything will get 
out of our hands. No matter what happened. 
No matter what, but I will not tolerate my insult. I cannot see both of them 
in this home, drag them out. But, how did they find out? 
I felt everything was fine. Aunt Mehreen saw the documents. Or else Arooj was blinded. No need to be emotional, Salman. This is not the solution
to this problem. This is the solution, dad. And the solution is that we drag them 
out of this house, before we face a big loss. Salman, look, this…
What do I look at dad? She has slapped me on my face. What? She dare raise her hand at my son. I will go and remind her of her worth. Wait, Shaista, wait. Before you do anything, think well. No need to think anything, and neither do you need to be scared. After all, Arooj has no proof that she is 
the owner of this property, that is why drag her out 
of this home. Exactly. Salman is absolutely right. We don’t need to be scared 
of them at all. Let us do what we want to. I will take care of her. You are a liar. Not just a liar, you also show fake love. Arooj! Lower your voice, you showed false love to me. You made a fake apology to mama, and now… you will give your life 
for your daughter? I am sure you are lying 
about this too. What did you think? Huh? What did you think? 
I will not find out anything. I have read all those papers, 
Salman. What will you do? 
Huh? What will you do with this wealth? Is all this more precious 
than selfless love? Where are you going? Elder madam… There is no need, go keep it back. But…
What but? Did you not hear me? Go keep it back. Now only my orders will be 
followed in this home. If you want to work in this home, then you will have 
to follow my orders. Go from here,
 keep it back. What is the matter, 
sister in law, Shaista? Why are you scolding 
Wasai like this? I am scolding her 
because of you. Because of me? Yes, because of you. But don’t worry, now she will not have to get 
scolded because of you. Because now you and your 
daughter won’t live in this home. What? Don’t act so innocent. You know well what your 
beloved daughter has done. Arooj did nothing sister in law. Salman was deceiving her
into signing. Stay quiet. You are calling my son a cheat? Your daughter is the cheater. Who played this entire game 
for this property? But sister in law…
Stop it. Now you or your daughter have 
nothing left to say or do. You and your daughter get out 
of this home, now. What are you saying? I am saying what you hear. Now go, take your daughter 
and leave from this home. Remember, I am saying 
this really nicely. Take your daughter and 
leave from this home. I shouldn’t see you here. Mama, I feel you shouldn’t have 
a lot of hopes from Salman. What do you mean, Arooj? Meaning, he can say and do anything. What do you want to say? I know you love Salman a lot. But, don’t have so many 
expectations from him, that you feel sorrow. Salman, did you find the documents? No, I searched the whole home. 
I didn’t find them anywhere. By the way, Salman, when will you start working 
on Areej textile? Arooj, you sign it today, 
I will work from tomorrow. Yes, so give me the file,
 I will sign it right now. I am unable to find it. I searching 
everywhere. It is nowhere. Oh. That reminds me, when I was signing the documents 
and I got up and left, then I felt that I took the documents
in mama’s room. Maybe, but I am not sure. So, I will do one thing, 
I will go check downstairs. You wait. 
Sit here comfortably. I will bring it. Thank you, Arooj. I know, mom and dad don’t like you. But I will give you and aunt Mehreen
all the happiness in the world. and your daughter? Is this even something to ask? I will give my life for her. I am scolding her because of you. Because of me? Yes, because of you. But don’t worry, now she will not have to get

daughter has done. Arooj did nothing sister in law. Salman was deceiving her

Stop it. Now you or your daughter have

and leave from this home. Remember, I am saying 
this really nicely. Take your daughter and 
leave from this home. I shouldn’t see you here. Mama, look here. What happened? Did someone say something? Tell me. What happened? These people are saying, that we leave from this home. Who is saying all this? Sister in law, Shaista. Who is she? Who is she to drag us out 
of our home? I don’t know what 
she thinks of herself. I will teach her a lesson today. Mom, Arooj forgave me, right? Yes, she did. I know her. I will not give you a chance 
to complain in future. Not, me. Arooj. I won’t. Okay, I will go to the office now. Sure. You have heard it right. You shouldn’t be mistaken 
in hearing it. Because this is the order of me,
Idrees and Salman. You and your mother have no other 
option but you accept this order. You people are mistaken and neither can you order me, 
nor my mother. And this is our home as well. This mask of deceit and fraud 
that you people had on your face it has been removed. Enough. Stop your nonsense. You are calling us cheaters? There is no need to argue, Arooj. You leave from this home, 
don’t blow this out of proportions. You have blown it out 
of proportions. Now the matter will end. I am ending this matter. Hah, you had the right 
to start the matter, but not to end it. I will end it! Look, child, how she is misbehaving… Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future. Look here. 
Salman. Salman. Do you have no manners to talk?
