[21.88] Mr. Judge,
[23.64] this is Arooj Ahmad’s DNA report.
[27.80] According to it,
[30.36] Arooj Ahmad is the daughter of 
Waqar Ahmad and madam Mehreen.
[53.76] Thus, there is no doubt.
[55.84] And along with that there is also madam
 Mehreen’s medical report as well,
[59.04] which clearly states that 
she is mentally fit,
[62.84] thus, her testimony cannot be denied
[65.40] and that is already 
in the court’s record.
[89.48] And the most important thing,
[92.40] there is a copy of the transfer papers
[94.96] for the wealth in the file you have.
[105.00] It is clear from it,
[106.52] that Waqar Ahmad transferred 
all his property to his daughter
[109.20] Arooj Ahmad twenty-two years back.
[127.84] Now I will request the honourable court,
[131.20] to make the decision for this case 
in favour of my client, Arooj Ahmad.
[140.40] You too have a seat, please.
[176.24] After hearing the arguments 
and evidence presented
[178.00] by the defendant's lawyer 
and the prosecution,
[179.64] in the light of all the proofs
and testimonies,
[181.88] this court has reached
the conclusion
[183.72] that the deceased Waqar Ahmad's 
daughter is indeed Arooj Ahmad.
[200.56] She is, in fact, the rightful owner of 
this property and all the businesses.
[213.56] The court declares 
the case dismissed.
[215.36] Court is adjourned.
[371.44] Naseema.
[373.48] Naseema.
[377.76] Hey.
[379.36] You?
[380.68] You still haven’t left?
[381.80] Hey, there is no need 
to go anywhere.
[385.52] Arooj called.
[387.88] Arooj called?
[390.48] Is all okay?
[391.80] Yes, all is okay,
[393.28] and I have a big good news.
[395.76] Congratulations, the decision has been
made in favour of our Arooj.
[400.16] Oh God,
[401.72] thank you God.
[404.00] See, did I not say,
[406.16] no matter how much 
the darkness spreads,
[408.00] one ray of light ends it.
[410.72] And our Arooj is the ray of this light.
[413.96] Yes,
[415.32] you were absolutely right.
[418.24] Our Arooj has gone through 
a lot of sorrow.
[420.68] Hey, you have to go through sorrow.
[422.72] God test his good servants,
[425.64] and when this test ends,
[427.96] then the oppressed gets respect
[431.12] and the cruel person gets humiliated.
[433.44] The sacrifice not only bears fruit
[436.36] but its yield is also very sweet.
[439.72] Master our Arooj has shown 
great patience.
[443.36] And God is with the patient.
[446.24] When He is with you, why do you 
need anyone else?
[449.56] I pray to God that our Arooj has 
happiness in her home.
[454.92] And may God make Salman 
better for Arooj.
[460.04] Amen.
[461.64] Hey, here you go,
[463.24] have sweets to celebrate 
our daughter’s success.
[468.20] I will first offer prayers 
of thankfulness,
[471.40] after that I will have sweets.
[473.40] You reminded me of a good thing,
[476.32] I will also offer prayers 
of thankfulness.
[479.08] I will go and perform ablution.
[731.20] Mama,
[734.24] give me the court order.
[753.64] Here is the court order.
[771.80] Now, no one should have 
a misunderstanding
[775.80] that I am not the owner 
of this home.
[802.20] Cruelty and injustice only have 
one night,
[813.00] and after every night,
there is a day.
[823.16] And that bright day only belongs
to the oppressed.
[848.80] Now what are you doing there 
standing and staring at us?
[856.60] Gather your things and 
leave from here.
[866.20] Mehreen, I…
Uncle,
[869.24] the time for forgiveness has passed.
[880.40] Now, the time for punishment 
has begun.
[885.24] Hey, you people didn’t even care
about the time that had passed.
[904.00] But I am giving you two 
a gift from me.
[908.68] Since you are going away 
from this home,
[911.12] so I have made arrangements 
for the two of you to stay.
[923.32] But, tonight,
[927.24] we don’t want to see any stranger’s 
face in our home at any cost.
[951.20] So,
[952.88] get out of our home!
[971.84] Come on, mama.
[979.56] Wasai,
[981.92] take Areej to her room
[985.60] and also take this file.
[987.92] Sure.
[1161.20] Finally,
[1165.96] we have come to our home.
[1173.20] We had to come, mama.
[1179.72] After getting tired for the whole day,
[1185.08] you find peace at your own home.
[1195.28] My Salman must be tired as well.
[1210.60] He too suffered with us.
[1215.00] Salman?
[1224.52] He was not with us.
[1228.00] He was not with them, either.
[1237.24] He was just misled by a few people
[1244.40] or else,
[1247.00] you know Salman.
[1256.48] Love is such a weird thing, mama.
[1269.92] If you fall in love with someone once,
[1274.24] we never seen any flaws of theirs.
[1280.84] You…
[1285.84] love?
[1297.20] Salman?
[1304.96] How do I answer this question?
[1321.72] You tell me,
[1324.28] what do you want?
[1341.28] What do you want?
[1348.16] The two of us…
[1351.08] I mean,
[1352.96] you and I,
[1357.64] a mother
[1360.60] and a wife.
[1365.36] Do you understand?
[1372.68] Yes.
[1376.16] What did you understand?
[1385.44] You want that
[1389.28] Salman lives with us,
[1393.36] that he doesn’t go anywhere.
[1397.36] Don’t you want this?
[1438.44] I too want this.
[1454.84] Live long.
[1457.48] Live long.
[1495.36] Master,
[1499.04] how many times will we 
send off our daughter?
[1505.52] And after she leaves,
[1508.76] we will miss her and cry.
[1519.96] Arooj once again made our home 
lonely and went.
[1540.20] Do you hear what I am saying?
[1545.60] I heard you, Naseema.
[1553.20] If the daughters are at their in-laws 
home it is good.
[1557.12] So,
[1558.68] why are you not happy?
[1570.16] I am worried thinking 
about her in-laws.
[1575.84] Idrees, Shaista,
[1582.08] to the extent that Arooj’s husband
 Salman,
[1585.80] they all oppose her.
[1588.84] So, what sort of in-laws are they?
[1598.88] If Arooj and sister Mehreen 
have to live together,
[1604.28] then that makes it Arooj’s 
mother’s home.
[1608.08] It is possible
[1611.80] that those people don’t leave 
the home and go?
[1616.04] This is more dangerous,
[1618.88] and I am thinking the same.
[1621.36] So, also explain it to me.
[1626.76] Look, those people who are 
after Arooj, Mehreen
[1631.52] and even that innocent soul’s life.
[1636.56] They cannot leave everything
 so easily.
[1643.68] Then?
[1646.56] What will happen, then?
[1710.84] I will not go.
[1713.24] I will stay here. I will not go.
[1728.72] No, all this is mine.
[1737.04] All this is mine.
[1739.00] This home, too.
[1744.00] All this is mine.
[1747.64] All this is mine.
[1759.00] No.
[1760.92] I won’t go from here. 
I won’t go.
[1771.88] I have so many memories 
at this home.
[1792.52] This is my home,
[1796.36] no one can drag me out of here.
[1801.12] No one can drag me out, 
all this is mine.
[1804.92] Every thing.
[1808.28] No one will take me out of here.
[1811.32] All this is mine.
[1813.72] All this belongs to Shaista. Shaista.
[1819.48] I have ruled this home 
for so many years.
[1827.20] Shaista.
[1828.36] Shaista, what are you doing?
Get a grip on yourself, Shaista.
[1832.68] How do I get a grip?
[1837.16] Why do I get a grip?
[1841.32] Idrees. Idrees,
[1843.44] I cannot leave this home and go.
[1845.52] I will not leave this home and go.
I will not leave.
[1847.92] This is our home. I won’t go.
This belongs to Shaista.
[1851.32] Listen to me. Listen to me. 
We will have to leave.
[1854.12] Arooj has won the ownership 
of everything.
[1856.40] It is the court’s order, 
try and understand.
[1858.16] No!
[1860.64] I don’t accept any court’s order.
[1863.88] All this is mine, 
I am the owner.
[1867.64] I am the owner of all these things.
[1871.12] She will drag me out of this home?
[1873.04] She will drag me out?
[1874.60] Stop it, Shaista. Stop it.
[1877.20] Don’t torture yourself like this.
[1880.60] No.
[1884.84] I will not torture myself.
[1889.12] I will torture those people,
[1892.68] who even thought about 
dragging out of this home.
[1897.24] You don’t understand, 
we cannot do anything.
[1903.20] You people must not be 
able to do anything,
[1906.12] but Shaista?
[1908.96] No one can stop Shaista.
[1912.08] No one can stop Shaista.
[1914.56] Shaista can do anything.
[1919.44] That girl from yesterday
[1925.04] will ruin my years of planning like this?
[1936.08] No,
[1938.52] this is not possible.
[1943.72] This is my home.
[1946.68] Where is this Salman?
Now Salman will come,
[1949.68] he will control you. Shaista,
[1951.52] what is wrong with you?
Why are you doing this?
[1956.76] Since this girl stepped in my life,
[1965.36] she ruined my life.
[1973.16] She ruined my planning
for so many years.
[1982.88] She wants to drag me out 
of my home.
[1987.96] No. No. I won’t go from here.
[1990.72] All this is mine.
[1992.64] No one can drag me out of here.
I won’t leave.
[1995.84] All this is mine. 
I won’t leave.
[1999.32] All this is mine.
I will not go from here.
[2003.72] Get up, Shaista.
Get up. Come on.
[2006.36] Get up. Get up.
[2010.52] We…
[2012.72] we cannot do anything.
[2015.16] I have heard it.
[2022.40] I know you cannot do anything,
[2027.40] but Shaista can.
[2039.92] Now you will see,
[2044.08] Shaista will do it.
[2047.84] Shaista will do it.
[2052.88] I will make this Arooj’s life 
so torturous,
[2060.88] that even after she is alive,
[2064.76] she will seem as though 
she is dead.
[2071.64] I will make her suffer.
[2076.08] She will not even get water.
[2078.92] I will make her life a living hell.
[2085.76] You will see.
[2088.20] You stay here, okay? 
No one should come inside.
[2090.60] I will go and see.
[2121.88] Did you see?
[2124.24] God’s stick is silent.
[2132.56] Did Areej go to sleep?
[2133.96] Yes, younger madam, 
really happily.
[2140.08] Wasai,
[2142.04] is Salman back?
[2144.16] No, elder madam,
[2146.40] he has not come till now.
[2148.32] But I have told the watchman
[2151.20] that as soon as little master comes,
[2153.48] he should send him to you.
[2160.52] And aunt and uncle?
Have those people left?
[2164.76] No.
[2166.04] They too are still in their room.
[2176.76] I could only hear the sound 
of fighting,
[2179.92] arguing and screaming 
from their room.
[2187.76] Then all of a sudden 
there was silence.
[2202.60] Areej.
[2209.12] Wasai, come on.
[2246.96] You,
[2249.84] your mother
[2252.20] and your mother’s mother
[2256.32] snatched everything from me.
[2260.72] You people are my enemies.
[2274.48] You are the wound
[2276.88] that I have to give to Mehreen 
and Arooj.
[2280.96] Areej.
[2284.56] Where is Areej?
[2286.52] You people are my enemies.
[2290.36] You people have snatched 
everything from me.
[2297.04] That’s why
[2299.40] you will have to die.
[2307.48] Mama, Areej is not in the room.
[2309.88] What?
[2311.04] Where will she be? 
Areej. Wasai?
[2316.00] I will drop you and kill you.
[2319.28] Areej.
[2320.24] Stop, what are you doing?
[2321.76] Don’t you dare. Stay away. 
Stay away.
[2322.96] Shaista.
Stay away.
[2325.04] Leave her…
[2326.04] Stay away. I will throw her down,
 I will kill her.
[2328.80] She is innocent, 
what has she done to you?
[2331.08] Please give her to me.
[2332.88] You are right,
[2335.64] she has no fault.
[2338.32] It is her mother’s fault…
[2341.76] it is your mother’s fault.
