I don’t know understand that even someone as educated as 
brother Salman can do this? No Shanzay, I don’t think Salman responsible 
in all this. What? What are you saying? Brother Salman treated you this way and you don’t even think 
he is responsible? I got tired of what aunt Mehreen 
was saying and I shouted at Salman in my anger. So what does this mean? He will drag you out of the home on this? Stop it Arooj. Don’t take brother Salman’s side. If you look at it, then I too wasn’t answering anything 
he was answering. I was staying distanced from him, so what could he do? If I stay quiet, I am ruined, if I speak, 
I am in turmoil. What do I do? Meaning, if you don’t say anything, then 
he would drag you out of the home. If you had spoken up, then maybe you 
would have found a solution for this problem. Shanzay, you know, my parents are already missing. In future everyone will point fingers 
on my identification, that who am I? How will I 
answer everyone? What will I say? Arooj, you do one thing, you go to your mother, 
aunt Naseema’s home. No. She too is not my own either. What will I do going to her. Now I feel that maybe I have no one in this world. So you will become a mental patient 
thinking like this. We will have to find a solution for this. I feel that maybe I am becoming a burden on you. No problem, I will leave. Arooj, wait. What are you saying? This is also your home. 
You can come here when you want. I can never object on this. Okay, sit. Sit. We will talk on this topic 
in the morning. You rest right now. Go and sleep. I want to stay here for a while. Okay, don’t worry further, okay? Don’t think too much. Rest. Do you want something? 
Should I bring it? Because your behavior is extraordinary, you have not done anything like 
this today. Don’t I know you? So what do you know? 
You know nothing. This means there is something 
that I don’t know. If you find out something, 
then tell me too. I am searching for that, because I am at the greatest loss. How is that? My Arooj got lost in this crowd
 of questions. Leave me. Leave me. Leave…
Get out of here. and don’t try to come back 
to this home again. You are still awake? You haven’t slept? I am worried cause of your worry. I have lost my sleep. But I have no worry. I am fine. You two are fine, but have you thought about Arooj? Where would she be? Arooj is not a child, sister in law Shaista. Wherever she went, she must have 
gone after thinking. This is what you think. The daughter of the child is 
out of the home, we too have a responsibility, right? What responsibility? That we go find her, 
we find out where she is. If you are so worried about her, 
then call her. I called, her phone is off. I don’t know where all will she be 
telling her sad story and defaming me. You should have thought of this when you held her hand and 
dragged her out of this home. I don’t know where that 
helpless child would be. What condition would she be in? Aren’t you sympathizing 
a lot with Arooj? I also sympathize with you. You never use your mind, nor do you think with your mind. Sister in law, Shaista. Salman is a sensible boy, he can think of what is good and 
bad for him better than you. So, please, don’t dictate him like this. What are you looking at standing 
for so long? I am seeing that this is such a big city. There are so many homes here. There are porches in the homes. My papa would also have 
a porch like this. Arooj, you will see, you will surely find your real parents 
one day. I pray for this with my heart. Will you be quiet. This is the limit. Your court never ends. You always have a session of 
questions and answers all the time. What do you think of yourself? I don’t find it necessary to answer
 any question of yours. You will remain completely 
quiet now! I say, leave me. Where are you taking me? 
Leave me. Salman, what are you doing?
Enough! No one will stop me. And no one dare come after me. Leave me. 
Leave me. I had a misunderstanding 
for no reason, that my Salman has been
 distanced from me. Arooj has him under her control. But the way, Salman, dragged Arooj out of the home 
for my sake, for the sake of his mother, he increased his mother’s trust and that Arooj’s misunderstanding
also got removed. What are you thinking, Arooj? Earlier, when I used to 
go to my parents’ home, I used to be really happy. I would have a peace, that I have a haven. That’s how it is even now. Today, I feel like a corner of that haven has moved and bright sunlight is entering 
from the other side. The whole night has passed, where has this Arooj gone? Her confidence tells me 
she surely has a place to go. She surely has a well-wisher. I will also find out about this. And whatever she is hiding from me, I will find out everything. You know this is the limit. She didn’t break her silence. Even if the relation breaks. yes, son, Salman. How are you? I am fine. Let me talk to Arooj. Arooj? Arooj is not here. What do you mean she is not there? She left at night. What did you say? She left home at night? She is not even here, 
so where did she go? She would know this. Nothing is left now. Nothing is left that I can even 
spend a day with Arooj. Arooj made the decision I was supposed to make. My heart is sinking. Arooj has left home since last night. The whole night has passed and Salman called just now. Something is wrong. I was even telling you last night that my heart is worried. I don’t know where my daughter 
would be. You continue to call her. Where are you coming from, child? What happened Arooj? Tell us something. Okay come. Come, have a seat. Salman was worried, he called. When did he call? A little while back. He was worried? He thought of me really soon. Tell us something, 
what has happened? Papa, you will not call Salman now. He doesn’t care about me at all. Arooj I knew it. I knew that she wouldn’t have gone 
to her parents home. Really? What did they say? They said that the whole night passed,
but she didn’t go to their home. Yes, so it is possible she got 
stuck in a trouble, anything can happen. Nothing must have happened to her, she would have gone to the place
of her liking. Salman, you call Shanzay. Please, call Shanzay, immediately. Her number is not connecting. She is her friend, she must have surely told her 
not to attend the phone. Mehreen, please be quiet. You say whatever comes to your heart. My heart is burning sister in law, 
Shaista, my son is worried. This girl has not given us anything 
other than worries. Aunt, you tell me yourself. If I had gotten angry, then should she have done all this. Yes, what else? She should have knocked on the door
after two minutes. But how could she do that? She had to blow this 
out of proportions. But not anymore. That girl is not worth keeping
 in this home. Salman, please. 
Don’t be emotional. Anything can happen to her,
worry for her. I am being emotional? And what about what she did? Hello. Yes, hello, son, Salman. Son, I had to tell you that 
Arooj has come here right now. I am coming. Fine. Who was on the phone? 
What did they say? Who was on the phone? 
Salman. Wasai, bring tea for me. Sure. Arooj, say something. 
What happened? Papa, you will not call Salman now. He doesn’t care about me at all. Why did you come and sit here? Naseema, the way Arooj has come. I feel that she didn’t come 
by her will. Arooj’s silence makes me feel that there is surely something. She will tell us herself, you don’t ask her a lot of questions. Since she has found out about her, she is going through a lot 
of mental torture. She even seems upset with Salman. She came without informing. Even Salman doesn’t know. Okay, you come inside. You don’t get unwell. Come. God will be kind, Naseema. Come on. 
Come. What has that Arooj made me? I changed myself so much for Arooj. But Arooj doesn’t realize this. Mom think that I am changed. She says I am not the Salman 
from before. I don’t even remember,
 who and what I am. Arooj doesn’t fear the breaking 
of this relation. But she doesn’t want to 
break her silence.
