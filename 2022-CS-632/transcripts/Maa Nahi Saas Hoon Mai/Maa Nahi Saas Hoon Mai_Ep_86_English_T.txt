[80.72] You had lost your memory 
after that accident.
[91.08] The doctor had said that
[93.00] if you are reminded of the past, 
then your life will be in danger.
[103.24] That’s why, no one used to talk to 
you about anything from the past.
[123.60] So, if this is the reality,
[128.48] then what was that,
[135.20] that I lived for twenty five years?
[144.28] Can that not become part 
of this reality?
[157.52] So much love,
[160.72] so much affection,
[167.44] that I gave to Salman,
[176.16] is it not enough for me to be his mother
and he to be my son?
[188.68] Being the son
[192.24] and remaining the son
[200.20] has a big difference.
[202.96] But
[204.24] no one saw this difference 
till yesterday.
[212.92] Sister-in-law Shaista,
 said one thing,
[215.32] and everyone sees 
the difference now.
[218.92] I don’t care about anyone,
[222.56] but today, my Salman shattered me.
[231.96] He shattered a mother.
[235.28] Please,
[237.00] get a grip on yourself.
[239.88] Save yourself from mental suffering,
 please.
[245.12] The thing everyone is trying 
to make me understand,
[249.56] is the reason for my suffering.
[291.56] I am your son’s wife.
[296.92] If your own daughter faced 
a similar treatment,
[299.64] then would you have tolerated it?
[303.44] You gave my answer 
in your question,
[308.48] that you are my daughter-in-law,
[311.04] not my daughter.
[313.68] I am not your daughter,
[316.04] but I am like your daughter.
[318.92] Yes,
[320.84] but maybe you don’t know that
[322.80] there is a big difference 
between being a daughter
[326.24] and being like a daughter.
[327.92] But if you want, you can end 
this difference.
[331.84] What does me wanting it 
or not wanting it do?
[335.36] If you call me mother,
[338.08] then will I become your mother?
[341.80] No, right?
[343.60] Just like that you, 
you are my daughter-in-law,
[347.32] you can never be my daughter.
[427.48] What is this?
[435.16] You started crying
[438.76] while trying to take care 
of your mother.
[443.64] I am crying on my fate.
[454.32] I found my mother after so long, 
with so many tries,
[457.08] with so much difficulty and,
[468.84] when I found mama,
[472.80] then I am sad that she is not 
even ready to hug me.
[480.04] My child.
[519.28] What do we do?
[521.08] Huh?
[522.40] I don’t understand anything,
[525.40] that whether I should be sad 
about Salman leaving
[529.68] or should I celebrate the happiness
 of finding my daughter after so long.
[532.88] I don’t understand anything.
[536.08] I don’t understand anything.
[573.16] Son, Salman.
[575.44] Son, Salman, where were you?
[581.28] I was calling you for so long,
[583.76] you weren’t even answering your phone.
I got so worried.
[586.32] There is no need for you 
to get worried.
[590.04] How are you talking to me?
[595.40] I am not a child,
[597.68] that I will get lost somewhere.
[603.24] You answer me.
[607.80] Am I a weak child,
[609.72] that anyone will hand me over 
to anyone and break ties with them.
[612.84] No. No. No. No, son.
[617.00] I know what you want to say,
[621.60] but I had never broken ties 
with you.
[803.12] What is the matter son, Salman?
[804.60] Don’t call me your son!
[809.76] Salman, lower your voice, 
she is your mother…
[811.96] Quiet!
[819.12] No one will speak,
[825.52] and they will not lie at all.
[832.68] I have found out everything.
[840.32] I have seen my birth certificate.
[844.32] That is wrong.
[846.80] Nothing is wrong.
[850.96] That was not a lie.
[882.64] What I was shown all these years 
as the truth is the lie.
[896.44] I am telling you,
[903.04] I am not your son.
[910.72] And neither are you my mother.
[919.68] In future, don’t call me your son.
[948.80] Salman is thinking 
I am responsible for this.
[961.96] Although, both of us are innocent.
[970.72] How can the ones who love 
be responsible?
[979.72] Both of us got punished
[985.96] by the mercilessness of time.
[1012.00] Salman.
[1018.84] My son.
[1025.72] Get a grip on yourself.
[1032.12] Fine, I didn’t give birth to you,
[1041.80] but you are my son.
[1150.20] All my life, I considered myself
to be an orphan,
[1151.84] even when my father was alive.
[1165.08] I used to call own father, uncle.
[1168.72] Why?
[1171.00] Why did you do this with me?
[1201.00] You must not have 
an answer, right?
[1204.00] Son,
[1206.52] we did all this for your betterment.
[1212.76] Betterment?
[1215.32] Is this betterment?
[1225.12] What is the betterment is separating 
someone and living, tell me?
[1237.36] You people made 
my entire life a lie.
[1242.60] And he is saying this.
[1245.12] You consider us responsible, right?
[1248.56] Responsible?
[1251.96] Responsible is a small word,
[1261.44] you people are sinners.
[1264.52] Playing with someone’s life is a sin.
[1268.04] Son, Salman…
Don’t touch me.
[1276.76] I am not the son of anyone 
out of the three of you.
[1353.60] Forgive me my child.
[1361.88] Why are you asking 
for forgiveness?
[1367.24] I have done a lot of injustice to you.
[1371.00] I have mistreated you a lot.
[1388.72] You didn’t do anything.
[1392.48] Whatever happened was done 
unknowingly and…That’s it.
[1399.12] But
[1401.56] as far as I can remember,
[1404.96] I did really wrong with you.
[1418.80] Whatever you have done,
[1422.72] was when you were my mother-in-law.
[1429.56] But now…
[1432.44] now you are my mother.
[1444.68] Should I tell you something?
[1448.20] Yes, tell me.
[1451.44] The day I found out 
you are my mother.
[1457.36] From that day, no matter how much
 you would get upset with me,
[1461.20] I would only feel love seeing you.
[1466.36] So, why did you not tell me, 
immediately?
[1468.36] You should have told me then, 
Why didn’t you tell me?
[1473.32] I would have surely told you, mama,
[1482.00] but because of your mental health,
[1485.60] I had a fear in my heart,
[1488.28] that God forbid, something 
might happen.
[1491.92] This Shaista and Idrees 
took advantage of this.
[1506.72] Now you don’t worry at all.
[1510.00] Your daughter is here.
[1513.56] I will fix everything.
[1518.64] That’s what will happen.
[1598.60] Son, why are you taking 
these tablets?
[1605.48] I have depression.
[1608.72] I feel that my mind will explode.
[1613.76] No, my love,
[1615.68] please, get a grip on yourself.
[1618.04] Just relax.
[1626.16] I should relax?
[1632.64] Someone is saying that be happy,
 someone is saying be sad,
[1635.20] someone is saying become 
someone’s son,
[1636.60] someone is saying become 
someone else’s son. Who am I?
[1643.48] Salman is a winding toy.
[1648.40] I did all this to save 
Mehreen’s life, son.
[1654.56] Fine,
[1657.60] Mr. Idrees is saying that
it was done for her,
[1659.60] you are saying it was to 
save someone’s life.
[1661.08] What had happened, tell me?
[1663.52] What do you think?
[1666.36] I have a fault in all this?
[1669.04] Why don’t you think for yourself
[1671.32] that what mother in the world
 will give a piece of her heart
[1675.28] and hand it over to someone else…
A mother like you.
[1678.56] Because you did all this.
[1681.88] Only, you.
[1683.44] Yes, I admit, I did it.
[1685.56] But I never let you go away 
from my sight.
[1690.40] I will not believe these meaningless
things you are saying.
[1696.20] But you will agree,
[1698.04] that I did all this for your betterment.
[1700.32] I don’t want to hear this.
[1702.64] My ears are tired of hearing
 this nonsense.
[1705.76] This is not nonsense, son. 
This is the reality.
[1709.60] So what happened to this reality?
[1711.76] Did it achieve anything?
[1713.96] Zero.
[1717.84] We did achieve something.
[1721.56] Now Salman is the only owner of the 
entire property, the entire business,
[1726.64] and this home.
[1729.80] This is what we achieved.
[1734.48] I put a stone on my heart 
for your happiness,
[1740.36] I was patient.
[1743.16] What else can a mother do?
[1748.44] Property. Business.
[1754.52] You people have put me 
in a difficult situation.
[1799.80] She was saying 
he is flying a kite,
[1803.44] he is running around, 
something like that.
[1806.76] What is she saying?
[1808.84] Mehreen was already a little mad,
[1810.64] your truth has made her 
completely mad.
[1814.08] Yes,
[1817.04] but I fear that
[1818.56] she might harm someone. 
Especially Salman.
[1821.84] She cannot harm anyone,
[1823.84] and definitely not Salman.
[1828.76] You accept her love for Salman?
[1833.12] This is a reality, whether 
we accept it or not?
[1839.32] You know,
[1840.40] if Mehreen goes completely mad
it will benefit us.
[1847.64] This way,
[1849.00] Salman too will become 
ours easily and
[1854.84] also all the properties.
[1891.00] Salman, your anger and complaint 
towards me and Shaista is justified,
[1895.88] but there is a big reality that 
you are not aware of.
[1899.76] Really?
[1902.00] So, there is some other reality
[1904.20] that has to be revealed to me.
[1906.00] You know as per the papers 
there is an Areej textile mill.
[1910.08] Yes, I know.
[1912.84] And you had asked me
[1914.72] who is this Areej in whose name 
this textile mill is?
[1920.00] I did ask you.
[1921.92] Did you get the answer for it?
[1924.92] None of you gave me any answer.
[1929.48] And do you also know that
[1931.72] Arooj’s parents are not her
 real parents…
[1934.16] Yes, I surely know that.
[1935.76] I was the one who helped Arooj 
to find her parents.
[1939.28] There is no need for that.
[1945.48] The Areej who want to find out
about is, Arooj.
[1955.72] Mehreen’s lost daughter.
[1978.36] This thing was hidden from everyone
 to hide it from Mehreen.
[1985.60] What…
[1989.24] What are you saying?
[2001.80] How is this possible?
[2011.24] The one who I always considered 
my mother,
[2016.56] she is not my mother, 
but Arooj’s mother.
[2021.08] Now you understand
[2022.72] how you became the heir of 
the entire business and wealth,
[2026.76] after Arooj went missing.
