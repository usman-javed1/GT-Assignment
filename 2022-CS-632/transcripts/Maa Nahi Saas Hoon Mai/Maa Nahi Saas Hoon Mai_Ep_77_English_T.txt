[31.12] Today, elder madam is loving 
Areej in a way
[37.64] that she used to play with you
twenty five years back.
[45.28] Mama longs for love.
[48.92] No one loved her.
[56.28] And even if she loved someone,
[60.48] then that is only Salman.
[68.52] Who is not even her son.
[71.92] You are right.
[74.92] But younger madam,
[82.44] I don’t know why I feel
[85.64] that elder madam will remember
 everything soon.
[98.04] But those people also seem 
in a lot of hurry.
[102.32] Yes,
[104.64] you are right.
[107.40] I too feel the same.
[116.52] Since aunt has found out
[120.12] that I am the daughter 
of this home, Areej,
[132.00] the owner of this entire property, 
this wealth,
[141.04] since then she has started
 to hate me.
[145.52] But maybe she doesn’t know that
[148.24] I have found out all this.
[157.24] And now I feel
[159.68] I will have to inform her about this.
[165.36] No, no,
[166.76] younger madam.
[172.44] There is no need for that.
[174.44] There is a need, Wasai.
[177.08] Now I will have to show the 
true picture to aunt.
[185.44] So that she stay in her limit,
[188.60] so that my family stays protected 
from her jealousy and envy.
[214.16] God,
[216.96] make younger madam’s 
difficulties easy.
[229.04] Come in.
[275.92] How did you think of coming 
to my room today?
[284.32] You are always found in your 
mother in law’s room.
[289.48] She is not my mother in law, 
she is my mother.
[301.56] You know this
[303.76] and I have also found out 
about this.
[306.68] So?
[315.20] Now, quickly go and inform 
Salman and Mehreen.
[320.32] Go.
[322.04] Hah,
[323.92] yes,
[326.36] I will surely tell them.
[332.24] But when the time comes.
[334.72] In fact, I will inform the entire city.
[349.52] But right now there is something
[352.24] that I especially want to tell you.
[355.16] That is,
[363.64] money is not everything,
[366.12] a person is important,
[367.96] relations are respectable,
[369.84] feelings are important.
[374.84] You came to give me this lecture? 
Huh?
[380.12] No.
[385.92] I just came to see if you 
find these important
[389.96] or you just consider them a lecture.
[392.24] Leave from here.
[394.28] Go.
[399.52] I am going.
[406.88] And yes,
[415.96] one last thing.
[425.72] I am the owner of this business,
property and wealth,
[446.24] and I have found out 
about this really well.
[458.52] So my advice is,
[460.72] stop dreaming about it.
[471.96] It is just a matter of me 
going to the court.
[478.52] I will ruin the game you planned 
for twenty five years in minutes.
[494.28] So, the result of everything 
I have said is that,
[498.12] stay away from the life of my husband,
my mother and my daughter.
[506.04] This is better for you.
[541.08] Idrees,
[543.36] why do you look so worried.
[546.92] What happened? 
You had gone to the lawyer.
[550.60] What did he tell you? 
What did he say?
[553.48] Everything is ruined. 
Everything is upside down.
[556.80] What do you mean?
 What happened?
[558.76] Waqar put his entire property 
and business in Areej’s name.
[564.00] Yes, all of us know that.
[566.12] Waqar died,  Areej got lost.
[568.56] So I got the legal right, 
so I gave Salman all the rights.
[573.20] Idrees, we know all this.
[576.00] What has happened now? 
Tell me.
[577.84] Now the real owner of the business 
and property is here.
[581.32] She will take her right from us.
[582.96] How will she take it like that?
[584.24] If we don’t give it, 
she will take it legally.
[586.16] She has a strong case. 
She is Waqar’s daughter.
[593.32] What is this problem? 
What will we do now?
[596.88] Now you will not do anything,
[599.40] I will do whatever needs to be done.
[718.24] Mussarat, how can I forget you 
and the children?
[720.84] I am just busy, I will visit.
[723.24] Yes.
[725.16] Okay listen, I am getting a call,
I will call you later.
[731.72] Yes, go ahead, Shaista,
 what is the matter?
[734.12] Arooj came
[738.96] to show her right.
[741.52] Huh? What right?
[744.60] She wants to take over the entire
business and property.
[755.24] She threatened me with the court.
[765.12] That’s it, Idrees,
[766.84] I am telling you,
[769.32] this entire property and business 
is going to get out of our hands.
[773.68] Nothing will go anywhere.
[777.84] What will we do now?
[780.72] Exactly, what I had thought.
[783.28] The last solution.,
[791.36] Now I feel I will have to 
implement that.
[810.00] Fine.
[828.88] Did you see?
[830.24] Did you see how this magician 
taking over the entire environment.
[834.36] Yes, I see it.
[835.48] You are only seeing it, 
but you are not doing anything.
[838.48] Shaista, we cannot bang 
our head on the wall
[840.88] for no reason and call it an attempt.
[845.92] We will have to make plans 
to break down the wall.
[849.04] No Idrees,
[851.08] you listen to me carefully.
[855.84] We will never agree that
 she is Waqar’s daughter.
[863.44] We will say she is a fraud.
[869.20] She is lying to take over 
the wealth and business.
[872.44] What are you saying, Shaista,
[874.04] nowadays, you find out immediately
through DNA testing.
[876.92] I don’t know what 
all you are thinking.
[913.64] She is not my mother in law,
[915.68] she is my mother.
[917.68] You know this and I have 
also found out about this.
[922.16] So?
[924.96] Now, quickly go and inform 
Salman and Mehreen.
[930.04] Go.
[931.88] Hah,
[933.64] yes,
[936.12] I will surely tell them.
[938.32] But when the time comes.
[940.52] In fact, I will inform the entire city.
[946.00] But right now there is something
[948.56] that I especially want to tell you.
[951.80] That is,
[955.92] money is not everything,
[958.36] a person is important,
[960.12] relations are respectable,
[962.04] feelings are important.
[971.04] I am the owner of this business, 
property and wealth,
[979.04] and I have found out 
about this really well.
[985.28] So my advice is,
[987.36] stop dreaming about it.
[992.36] It is just a matter of me going 
to the court.
[997.08] I will ruin the game you planned 
for twenty five years in minutes.
[1007.44] So, the result of everything 
I have said is that,
[1011.36] stay away from the life of my husband,
my mother and my daughter.
[1017.16] This is better for you.
[1023.40] The last solution.
[1025.84] Now I feel I will have 
to implement that.
[1031.84] Last solution?
[1038.28] What is going on in Idrees’ head?
[1045.76] What has he thought of?
[1163.36] Greetings, sir.
[1164.76] Greetings.
[1168.76] Tell me, sir. 
What do you want?
[1172.48] You have to do something
 important,
[1175.16] but you have to do it 
in a clean manner.
[1179.96] Sir, we do everything 
in a clean manner,
[1182.88] but tell me, who do you want 
removed from your path?
[1186.84] There is a girl, 
her picture is in this.
[1205.80] Here you go.
[1207.72] Rest, after the work is done.
[1231.72] It will be done, sir.
[1234.44] But when do we have to do it?
[1236.64] I will tell you that.
[1240.24] Wait for my call
[1242.04] and always be ready.
[1244.16] And don’t give them a chance. 
You won’t get this opportunity again.
[1247.96] Don’t worry, sir.
[1250.68] Your work will be done.
[1253.20] I will go now.
[1260.68] Driver, come on.
[1281.16] Little baby, Areej.
[1284.08] Little love.
[1285.80] She has small hands.
[1289.68] Yes, Salman?
[1291.36] Mom, I wanted permission 
from you.
[1295.80] Permission for what?
[1297.72] I want to take Arooj for dinner.
[1302.48] Yes, fine, go.
[1306.92] Listen.
[1310.76] There are a few things 
for my lovely Areej,
[1314.68] I will message you,
do bring them.
[1319.04] Sure.
[1320.88] See, papa is going.
[1323.16] Papa is going with mama.
[1326.88] Say goodbye to papa.
[1330.52] Okay, you take care of yourself.
[1332.12] Yes.
[1344.96] Say bye, 
bye to papa.
[1346.64] Bye. Bye. 
Goodbye.
[1416.44] Now if we are going out, 
then fix your mood.
[1419.96] I am just going because of you,
[1421.56] or else I was not in the mood.
[1431.04] Arooj, we will go out, 
have a good dinner,
[1433.68] we will shop, 
your mood will be fine.
[1436.60] No one can say anything
in front of your insistence.
[1439.16] Come on.
[1498.08] The car is leaving just now.
[1500.56] But remember, just the girl.
[1511.48] The boy shouldn’t even get a scratch.
[1513.60] Understand?
[1515.32] Okay.
[1553.28] Oh wow,
[1555.96] you kept on calling me stupid
[1558.36] and you are planning 
all this yourself?
[1564.68] This is correct.
[1566.76] If you had to do this,
[1568.76] then you should have waited a little.
[1575.44] You should have done it 
when Arooj was alone.
[1580.20] We don’t have time to wait.
[1583.28] But even Salman can get 
affected by this.
[1586.96] Nothing will happen.
[1588.44] He is an expert shooter, 
nothing will happen.
[1592.08] Still, there is no room of mistake
in such things,
[1595.72] you are taking a big risk.
[1597.32] Look, we have to take a risk
[1599.12] and you be patient, everything 
is going according to plan.
[1601.72] Everything will be fine.
[1634.56] Is everything fine, son, Salman?
[1638.60] Uncle, what is all this?
[1642.36] I was going through some old documents
 and these are some property files,
[1645.96] they are all in Areej’s name.
 Who is she?
[1648.64] I had told you, 
that Mehreen liked the name…
[1652.84] How can all this happen 
on liking a name?
[1656.28] And we don’t know about this.
[1661.84] Son, actually, I have no idea of this.
[1668.20] Late Waqar used to handle everything.
[1670.80] Whatever he used to do would be final,
[1672.68] I never even questioned him.
[1676.28] If you ask me the truth, 
I had never even thought
[1679.16] that I would have to live 
without my brother
[1682.00] and take care of this 
entire business.
[1692.04] Shaista, what would you know.
[1696.16] No risk,
[1699.32] no gain.
[1747.80] Master, this is the place, right?
[1751.60] You just keep the bike ready,
[1753.36] and turn it around, got it?
[1755.88] Fine. 
I will just come.
[1875.40] Come on. Come on, 
start the bike.
[1889.60] Oh, Salman.
[1893.72] Salman, you are bleeding.
[1896.44] Are you fine?
[1897.56] I am fine, come on.
Come to the hospital.
[1899.80] Come on.
[1901.00] Who were they?
Leave everyone. You are bleeding.
[1903.84] Be quick. Come on. Careful.
[1940.48] Salman, are you fine?
[1943.12] Arooj, drive slowly.
[1945.92] I am driving fine.
[1948.12] Arooj, I am absolutely fine, 
why are you worried?
[1951.76] You are bleeding.
[1953.56] It is necessary for us 
to reach the hospital.
[1959.20] You are fine,
[1962.52] this is enough for me.
[1965.92] You are mad.
[1971.92] Does it hurt? 
We are going to reach soon.
[2048.96] Yes?
[2050.12] Is the work done?
[2051.16] Sir we took the aim from close, 
but…
[2054.36] What if and but? 
What happened?
[2056.36] The girl moved from the target 
at the last moment
[2058.84] and she didn’t get shot.
