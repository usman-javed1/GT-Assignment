Madam. Madam. All hell has broken loose madam. What happened? 
What happened? Younger madam has found out that younger sir is not elder madam’s son. She heard you and elder sir talking. What are you saying, Wasai? This is really a torment. Madam, if little madam hadn’t heard this 
with her own ears, then I would have denied it. Now I cannot even deny it. No one found out this secret 
for twenty five years. If this thing is out in the 
open completely, then it will be really bad, Wasai. Madam, you make little madam understand 
that she stays quiet. Yes. But what will I say to Salman? If this secret comes in front of him 
completely? I… I will talk to Arooj. Okay. Now even mama has given orders that Salman is Mehreen’s son. But what will our Salman get? Think a little. Mehreen has lost her memory, we know nothing about Areej, whether she is dead or alive. And Mehreen is considering 
Salman her son. So who does all this belong to? It belongs to your Salman. What is all this? What is all this, after all? I am not the daughter of my parents. Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son. And if, Salman is not aunty’s son, then whose son is he? Did someone also find him 
on the road? And someone put him in the arms 
of a mental patient? Are me and Salman suffering 
from the same sorrow? Younger madam has found out that younger sir is not elder madam’s son. She heard you and elder sir talking. What are you saying, Wasai? This is really a torment. Madam, if little madam hadn’t heard this 
with her own ears, then I would have denied it. Now I cannot even deny it. The tables will be turned on the game that I have made for Salman. If Mehreen finds out this, 
then all hell will break loose. What happened Shahista? 
What are you thinking about? It is something worrisome. Is all okay? What happened? Everything is okay till now, but it will not remain okay for long. Hey, tell me, what happened? Arooj heard all that 
we were talking about. I used to tell you not to talk about this
again and again for this day. This is not the time to get 
angry with me. Right now, tell me, 
what do we have to do? What trouble have you put me in. Arooj shouldn’t find out any further and she will have to stay quiet 
for what this is and why this is. If she insists on knowing? Keep avoiding it, no matter what. and if she asks Salman, then? You will ensure that you restrict 
Arooj from talking to Salman. No matter what happens. She is comparing my love and 
her love making Salman stand in a court. You think yourself, aunt. How difficult will all this be for a son? and mothers happily put their sons 
in this difficulty daily. So you have found out. This is true, Arooj, child. If Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son, then whose son is he? We have a relative, Salman is their child. So, does Salman know this? He doesn’t know and neither does Mehreen know. If Mehreen finds out this truth, then she will not be able to 
tolerate this mental trauma, and if Salman finds out about this, then his personality will be ruined. I don’t understand. I mean, the whole home is acting of lying 
including Wasai. and I want that you support us too. And stay quiet. You will not tell anyone this truth. Can you do that for me? Arooj please. God, have mercy. All will break loose in this home, there will be an earthquake. She will never accept that 
he is not her son. Who, Wasai? Who is not whose son? I… I was talking about my son. I have no son. If I had a son, then I wouldn’t have had to work 
so hard in this age. Hmmm. You know Wasai, lucky mothers like me have sons.
Right? Yes. Yes. You are absolutely right. You start your work. Sure. So you have found out. This is the truth, Arooj, child. If Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son, then whose son is he? We have a relative, Salman is their child. So, does Salman know this? He doesn’t know and neither does Mehreen know. If Mehreen finds out this truth, then she will not be able to tolerate 
this mental trauma, the whole home is acting of lying 
including Wasai. and I want that you support us too. And stay quiet. You will not tell anyone this truth. Can you do that for me? What accident happened with 
aunt Mehreen, that she... started considering Salman 
her son mentally. This means aunt Mehreen is not in her 
correct mental state. And by the time she comes 
to her right mental state, she will not remain Salman’s mama. But… but aunt Mehreen will get 
fine someday. And this can happen at any day. What is this that me and Salman live with mothers who are not our own. But my sorrow is much bigger 
than Salman’s. We know about Salman’s real parents, but who are my parents? No one knows this. Who told you Salman? My friend’s father told me. He told me there is a family who lost their
daughter twenty four to twenty five years ago. I feel you can be that child. And? And what did they tell you? 
Tell me. Where was she born? 
Who are those people? What was her name? He must have told you 
anything more. I don’t know about this. We can find out when 
we meet them. Yes, so when will we meet them? We are going to meet them 
tomorrow morning. Morning? We will meet them tomorrow morning? Why in the morning? Why can we not meet them right now? When will it be morning? Are you going to the office? And where is Arooj going? Yes, I had to go something out of city,
so I thought I would pick Arooj too. She will also have an outing. Okay. So I too will come along 
with you people. I also haven’t gone out for long. Mehreen, you surprise me. We are not in the age that 
we go for an outing. The kids are of the age,
 let them go. But sister in law Shaista, I.. Mehreen, please. You children go, 
Go and enjoy. Bye. Bye. 
Bye. Madam. Yes? You have sent little madam
and little master, but a big scene will be created 
with them gone. Elder madam is really angry. Hey, when is she not angry? So tell me, what were she saying now? She was saying let younger madam come, then I will teach her a lesson. This woman will not let anyone 
live in this home. Anyway, when Arooj comes, 
you will tell me first. I will handle the entire matter. Yes, madam, as you order. Now my patience is running out. Then go. Go and tell him. Think, when Salman will find out 
you are his real mother, how much will he hate you. That in childhood you put her 
in Mehreen’s arms, for money. Not for the sake of money, for the sake of Mehreen’s life. Fool everyone, but don’t fool me and yourself, 
Shaista. Salman, you are already really late 
for the office. I think you should go now. Goodbye. Arooj. 
Yes. I am really sorry. My information turned out to be wrong and that family was not your family. And your hope broke. What are you saying? You tried, you supported me, rest is up to my fate. I am really hopeful that you will find your family soon. I will go now. Take care of yourself. Listen. Thank you, for trying so much for me. Salman is searching for my family 
in my love. He doesn’t know that he himself lives in the home 
of a stranger. Those parents must be so cruel who put the life of their own son to save someone’s life. Even after knowing everything, they put him in aunt Mehreen’s arms. Stop. Where are you coming from? I had told you in the morning. So? Will tell me again break hell loose? Where are taking my son 
in the name of outing? My son is stuck in weird problems. You lied and took him to
your parent’s home. Aunty, I am already really worried. 
I will talk to you later. Keep your worry to yourself, 
why are you worrying my son? The worries of me and 
Salman are not different. I don’t care about your worries,
I only worry for my son. Where did you leave my son? Huh? My son is stuck in a weird problem. My son. My son. My son. Why are you saying this 
again and again? Have you lost your mind? Salman is not your son. He is not your son. Idrees, where are you? Come home immediately. What could happen? The same drama of Mehreen. The doctor is here to check up on her. Salman is showing her. You reach home, I will tell you. Okay. Arooj. What did you do? I didn’t expect you to be this stupid. How many times had I told you 
not to mention this in front of Mehreen, that Salman is not her son. Aunt, I was angry, I said it. You didn’t have to say it. So what do I do, aunt? A person is coming from outside.
What mood are they in? At times the mood is good 
at times not. She always talks to me 
in the same tone. Can a person lose their patience
 for once, or not? You are right child. I know you are good. In fact, you are very good. We have been trying Mehreen 
for years, expecting good from her 
is out stupidity. But… The issue is of this but. Even you know what is correct. But still, no one is willing to say 
aunt Mehreen is wrong. You tried speaking the truth, was Mehreen able to tolerate it? Have no relation with your relations 
is a heavy truth. You are right, child. I cannot Salman my own, 
even after he is mine.
