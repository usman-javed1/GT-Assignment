Disturb? We are disturbing you? You have disturbed 
all of us, Salman. After Arooj and I, you have become the 
enemy of innocent people... ... like sister Naseema 
and master Shoaib. I didn’t do anything, and even if I have done something, then I am not answerable
 to your useless questions. I don’t want to make you 
answerable for anything, either. Just tell me, don’t you miss your mother? Don’t you miss her? I don’t have an answer
 for these useless things. And don’t you dare follow me again. Now, move from here. I said, move from here. Is it giving you peace? A lot of peace. Do you know, mom, when I come to you, I forget all my difficulties. After all my son is my life. Hmmm My son is my life. The sun has set. Arooj, sister Mehreen still 
hasn’t come back. God be kind. I don’t know where she is. Mama. Where did you go? I… I didn’t go anywhere. I went some place close by. Why are you looking away from me? Tell me, where did you go? I… why would I look away from you? Then tell me, where were you? I told you Arooj, I went to some place close by. You know well, you 
cannot hide anything from me. Then why are you trying to hide it? Tell me. No, I told you there is nothing like that. I…. You went to meet Salman, right? I… I didn’t bring up Salman like this. You tell me, Arooj, did I bring him up badly? Since childhood till today, I gave flowers and toys in his hands. This gun… where did this gun 
come in his hands from? How did he start doing
 this bloodshed and all this? How, Arooj? No. No, my Salman is not like that. He is not like that at all. What did he say to you? He said, he… he was right. Maybe he did all this by mistake. Mama, stop it. I know what he
 would have said to you. I know well. And I also know that you have brought up 
Salman really well. You have brought him 
up like an exemplary mother. But he has lost his way, mama and there is no way to return. As painful this is for you, it is equally painful for me as well. But I feel that the sooner the two 
of us will accept this, the better it will be for us. I will bring water for you. After Arooj and I, you have become the 
enemy of innocent people ... ...like sister Naseema 
and master Shoaib. I didn’t do anything, and even if I have
 done something, then I am not answerable 
to your useless questions. I don’t want to make you 
answerable for anything, either. Just tell me, don’t you miss your mother? Don’t you miss her? I don’t have an answer
 for these useless things. And don’t you dare follow me again. Now, move from here. I said, move from here. Arooj. Yes? Child, you are going but my heart is really worried. You shouldn’t leave the home 
after this accident of master Shoaib. Nothing will happen mama, and till your prayers are with me, no one can do anything with me. And even if 
I sit at home, then how will we manage 
the expenses at home? Sister Mehreen, when will she stop now? She will make sure she does 
what she has thought about. And you people just pray for me, that God gives me success. What turn has life brought us to. There must be a path
 ahead of this turn, mama. And that path will surely
 be of betterment. I will go now. Goodbye. Goodbye. Sister, don’t worry. God will make it all fine. Everything will be better. We kept on getting worried here, why did you people
 not tell us anything? If I had told you people, then you people would 
have also gotten worried. Thank God, He blessed us. Master, God has given you a second life. This is because of 
the prayers of all of you, or the attacker tried his best. And he had also lost 
a lot of blood. Thank God brother Nasir’s friends 
made immediate arrangements. If this was the position, then why did you 
people come home? So, papa was in 
a hurry to come home, the doctor had insisted that he should remain 
admitted in the hospital. Hey, I would have gotten 
admitted at the hospital, but do you have any idea 
how much it would have cost? I don’t want to enjoy anything. I want to give humiliation 
and pain to Arooj. Sister-in-law Arooj has no fault. It is her fault. She came in my life and 
she ruined my life. You are forgetting everything
 in your anger and passion. And this is the worst
 thing about anger. What? What am I forgetting? That sister-in-law Arooj was your love and you married out of love. I made a mistake that I loved her. I have forgotten everything. Salman, you are trying to look
 through the eyes of your wish, and this will not have good results. I came here to talk to you 
about what is in my heart. But you want to be a philosopher, so fine, sit. Greetings. Greetings. Is Mr. Nasir in the office? Yes, madam. I have to meet him. Madam, what is your name? Arooj. Arooj Ahmad. Fine, I will inform sir. Yes? Sir, Miss Arooj has 
come to meet you. Sister-in-law Arooj has come? I am coming to get her myself. Fine sir. Madam, sir is coming
 to get you himself. Thank you. Greetings. Greetings. Sister-in-law, you.. what a pleasant surprise. I have to talk to you 
about something important. Come sister-in-law, lets go to my room. Yes. Come in. Thank you. Sister-in-law, please sit. Will you have tea or coffee? Nothing. How, so? Let’s have coffee, 
I am also in the mood for it. Two coffees, bring it quickly. Yes, sister-in-law. What do I tell you brother Nasir? Sister-in-law, 
Salman had told me. Believe me, 
I was really hurt to hear it. I tried a lot to make
 him understand, but you know him. Brother Nasir, who can understand
 Salman better than me. Sister-in-law, 
he is just a little emotional. But believe me, 
he is not bad at heart. At times he makes
 wrong emotional decisions. What do I do with such
 a heart brother Nasir, who is upset with itself? Mama… I mean, aunt Mehreen brought up
 Salman with a lot of love. Anyway, why am I tell you all this, you know the entire story. I saw your ad in the newspaper. There was a job
 requirement. I thought I would apply here. Brother Nasir, I really need a job right now. You please check these documents, if I fulfill your requirements, then please hire me. Sister-in-law, why 
are you embarrassing me, this is your office, and no one can doubt 
your capability. You know, when you
 had joined Salman’s office you made his
 company profitable and everyone knows this. You just join my company, there will be nothing 
better than this for me. You joining my company will not be my good luck,
 it will be my good luck. Why are you embarrassing
 me brother Nasir? But I will want to say one thing. If appointing me 
will cause issues in ... ...your relationship 
with Salman, then I wouldn’t want to do this job. Sister-in-law, 
don’t worry about this. This is my office, and I own it. You join from tomorrow. I will just get your 
appointment letter made. The situation we are going through, we surely have to steal happiness and getting a job in situation
 is no less than any happiness. You are right Arooj, thank God. What do we have 
to be happy about, and what we don’t have
 to be happy about, at times a person is unable
 to differentiate between this. When a person suffers at 
the hands of the situation, then they even forget how to respect. But you have brought me up
 in touch conditions, papa. No matter how the condition, I cannot forget respect.
