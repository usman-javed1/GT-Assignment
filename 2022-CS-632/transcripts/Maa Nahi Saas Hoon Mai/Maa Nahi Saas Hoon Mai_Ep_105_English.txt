Child, both your mothers think that we should get Areej through 
the help of the police. What is your opinion? You were saying that you are
 thinking something. Yes, I am thinking. But Naseema and sister Mehreen 
are saying we do a case. I just want my Areej back. Can I ask you something, child? Go ahead. Do you want to live with Salman, after what he did with you 
and your mama. Child, I don’t understand 
the meaning of your silence, whether it is a yes, or a no. Arooj, child, what are you thinking? Nothing, mama, I was just thinking about Areej. Arooj, sit down, child. Thinking like this doesn’t 
solve problems. Arooj, where did your father go? Where did he go, meaning? Yes, Arooj, Master Shoaib has been 
gone for long. Did he say something to you
 before leaving? I don’t know where papa is, in fact, I don’t know when 
and where he went. Okay, you call him. Yes, I will call him. Hey, phone….
See! He even left his phone here. Now God forbid, 
if we have the need, then where will we call? Sister Naseema, don’t worry. He must have gone for some important
 work, he will come back. Yes, I remember, papa had to go for my work as well. He was saying he has a plan, 
maybe, he went there. No matter what sister Mehreen, he should inform us and go. You get worried. Why are you worried, mama? This way the worry will 
increase more. You worry, child. You know your papa doesn’t 
stay well either. You get weird thoughts 
in your heart. Where can he go? Don’t worry, God will make it all fine. I want to make my final attempt. Maybe, I will be able to 
change Salman’s heart. Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t pass from the police station. I will try my best to save my home. Even after so much happened? Only for the sake of my daughter. I think the same. You have reduced the burden 
on my heart by saying this. I want all the account details 
on my table tomorrow. And the meeting we had 
with Ahmad Association. Sir? 
Get it fixed. Okay sir. He still hasn’t left. Sir, he is waiting for you 
for a long time. He is a really stubborn man. Check if he is dead. Sir. Forgive me, I am not well, 
that’s why I fell asleep. Is Mr. Salman free? Sir has left. He left? But I had to meet him. When did he leave? Just a minute back. Okay, thank you. I will see. God knows what worry the poor thing
 would have been in. He sat all day long and Mr. Salman didn’t meet him. Give me the keys. Sit. Salman. Salman. I came to meet you. You are lying. You didn’t come to meet me, 
in fact, you came to sleep. I didn’t meet you so that 
your sleep doesn’t get disturbed. I am not well, so I dozed off. So if you are not well, 
then go to the doctor, what did you come to me for? Right now you are the doctor. You have the cure for our sorrow. What is this informality? Don’t you have manners 
on how to talk? I apologize, sir. I just came to say that don’t ruin Arooj’s home. What do you mean? I have ruined it? How dare you say something 
to useless to me? Actually, Areej is also with you, so Arooj is crying continuously. Have mercy on her. There is still time. Leave from here, or else 
I will have the guard drag you out. Don’t do that. My daughter will go mad. Really? So, she is your daughter? With what relation? You can say anything, but don’t separate Areej 
and Arooj from you. Please. Don’t try to dictate me. Get out of here. Son, I had to come to you 
to thank you, but I had gotten unwell, 
so I couldn’t come. Oh, so, how are you feeling now? Thank God, now I am fine. Okay. Master, constantly praises you. Son, you did such a good deed. You have helped the children. Hey, no, there is no need to praise me. This was my responsibility. Actually, today I need your help. Yes, go ahead, Mr. Salman. Actually, the thing is that I like your daughter. I have come for her proposal. If you people don’t have 
an objection, then. Papa, you were lying in the room, what was the need to come here? Child, my heart worries 
lying down for long. Sit comfortably. Are you fine? Yes, child, I am fine. How do you feel now? I feel better now, son. If you want, then should I take 
an appointment from another doctor? Get your checkup done again? No, son, there is no need for that, I am fine. It is just weakness, it will be fine with time. She is a daughter, she worries quickly. She finds a small illness of 
a father as really big. That’s what a daughter’s heart is like. Arooj, I think your father is here. Is everything okay? Why are you walking like this? I am fine. I am fine. Where did you go? I went to meet Salman. To meet Salman? Why? To talk about your issue. I told him to save his home 
from being ruined. Then? Then what did he say? He cursed me. And he pushed me down. What? Salman pushed you? He has gathered so much courage? I will deal with him. Arooj, wait. Where are you going at this hour? Don’t stop me today, mama. Because if I don’t go today, then I will never be able to go. Stop, Arooj. Arooj, child. Arooj. God, what is happening? You pushed my father? Huh? You pushed him? Push me. Hit me. Why don’t you hit me? What do you think of yourself? What is this arrogance for? Respect. Fame. Why are you quiet? Speak up. Lower your voice. This is my home, you are not allowed 
to talk loudly here. I will talk loudly. And what is this home 
you are talking about? Two minutes. The ground from under your feet 
will be pulled in two minutes. Areej. Areej. You cannot take Areej. You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother. I will stop you.
Leave me. Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it. Leave it… Arooj. How dare you raise your hand
 at my son? A mother has slapped him 
for her daughter. But how will you understand this? If you take Areej from here,
then I will kill you. You will kill me? Kill me. Kill me. Shoot. Why don’t you shoot? Murder me. Tell Areej that a mother sacrificed
her life for her daughter. Shoot. Come on, shoot. Hey, leave it. 
Coward. How will you shoot someone? It will cost you a lot to take Areej. I am not a businessperson 
like you people, that I will account for cheap
and expensive. I am a mother. If you take Areej from here, 
you will have to face a lot of loss. I will divorce you. You can do what you want. I am not afraid of anything now. I will take my daughter from here. I will see how you take her...
No What is all this? 
What is going on? Idrees, this Arooj did all this drama. She slapped Salman. Shaista. Salman. You people go to the room. But she is taking Areej. I told you to go to the room. Dad, I won’t leave her. Salman. Go. Go. Go to the room right now. Okay, come on. Come, son. Mom…
Come on. Come on. Look child, 
how she is misbehaving… Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future. Look here. 
Salman. Salman. Do you have no manners to talk? I will drag you out…
Salman. Salman, no. Leave me, papa. 
No. Why are you stopping him? What will you do with me? Huh? Why did you stop? 
What do you think? I will get scared of this action of yours? I am not afraid of anyone. All of you hear me carefully. Stop your nonsense. I will throw you out of 
this home right now. This home belongs to me 
and my mother’s home. No one can drag us out of here. Do you people understand? Hear me out clearly. This home belongs to me 
and my mother’s home. Is everything okay? Why are you walking like this? I am fine. I am fine. Where did you go? I went to meet Salman. To meet Salman? Why? To talk about your issue. I told him to save his home 
from being ruined. Then? 
Then what did he say? He cursed me. And he pushed me down. You cannot take Areej. You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother. I will stop you.
Leave me. Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it. Leave it… Arooj. How dare you raise 
your hand at my son? A mother has slapped him 
for her daughter. But how will you understand this? If you take Areej from here, 
then I will kill you. It will cost you a lot to take Areej. I am not a businessperson
like you people, that I will account for cheap
and expensive. I am a mother. If you take Areej from here, 
you will have to face a lot of loss. I will divorce you.
