He quit the job for my sake. He saved my home. There is nothing like that. You are mistaken. He was a really smart man. He knew he would get 
caught that is why he left himself. After all you really sympathize 
with him a lot. I can see it. I sympathize with his sick mother, who is a cancer patient. Actually, not everything 
is business. Some things are ahead 
of basic counting. If you want, I can help him. His mother will get treated. You will help him? Kindly clear his dues soon. The poor thing needs money. A cheque for five 
hundred thousand, for your mother’s treatment. I am so sorry, I cannot take this, and yes, your claim to recognize
 people is not correct. Son, Ammad. Yes? Can I ask you something? Mama, listen to me. You are not well, so don’t talk, okay? Son, I know when you don’t want to answer me, you do this. Okay, I am so, sorry. Tell me, what is the matter? Son, why did you quit the job? Mama, had I not quit the job, then Mr. Salman would have left Arooj. What happened Ammad? Leave it, mama. Just think that whatever 
decision your son made, he did after thinking hard. But son, you are worried. No. Not at all. How will you get me treated, son? God used to get it done earlier, He will do it even now. You rest, lie down. Come on. Lie down. Little madam, come for breakfast. Elder madam is really angry. Anyway, she is always angry. You go ahead, I will come. I told you, you go ahead, I am coming. Okay. Hello. What happened Shanzay? 
All okay? You are calling so 
early in the morning? I am really worried, Arooj. What happened? All okay? Are you fine? I am fine, but Ammad is not. Why? What happened to him? His mama is unwell. That’s why I get upset with him. I was taking a stand for him, and he left the game himself. Leave all this. I just know that Ammad 
has no money at all, and his mother is a cancer patient. And you know well how much is
 the regular expense of a cancer patient. Yes. I will have to do something. Can you do something, Shanzay? You force him to meet me once. At least he should meet me. Because if I ask him, then he will not listen to me at all. Yes, I can ask him but let’s see what happens then. Okay fine, we will see 
what can be done. I will call you, okay? Goodbye. Okay, goodbye. Hello. Hello, Ammad. Shall we have breakfast? Huh? Yes, I am waiting for mom. What is the matter? Why is the environment in
home like that of a mourning? Is someone dead? I am addressing you, Arooj? Yes, aunty. If I have said you, then this means, 
I am addressing you. Why do you have such 
a sad face like that? Did you two have an argument? No aunty, I am not well. Why? What happened to you? Nothing. She is a weird girl. She changes her statements 
within moments. It is your courage, Salman, that you tolerate this Arooj. No action of hers is right. Come on, let’s have breakfast. Wasai, have breakfast served. Arooj, won’t you have breakfast? My breakfast is done. My stomach is full. Look, if you have called me here,
 to help me, then my answer is clear. I have called you for help,
 but for my help. And yes, I don’t believe in breaking
 the rules of friends. That’s good, then tell me, how can
 I be of help for you? I will tell you. But I tell you on one condition. You will have to accept
 whatever I say. You will not ask any questions. Come on, man, don’t bother 
me with these conditions, just tell me clearly 
what do I have to do? Actually, the thing is Ammad, that I have made an entire
 plan to reveal uncle. I am just not able to execute that plan. Oh, you want that
 I rejoin the office? Huh? No, I don’t want that you join 
the office again. Then? I just want that you can help me in revealing uncle. Okay. Maybe you don’t know a lot of negatives are being 
said for you and me and they are reaching Salman. I know Salman is not like this at all, but now I feel that I will have to do something. And by the way, I will pay you to do all this, as my case consultant. Is that okay? Okay. Fine, I will do one thing, I will take you to such a home, where marble worth sixty-five 
hundred thousand has been laid, that too by your uncle. That’s the home. Greetings. Greetings. If someone lives inside, then can we meet them? Sir is not at home. Man, whenever I come, you say the same thing, that sir is not at home. When sir in not there, then where do I bring him for you? Look, if anyone is present at home, then I will go inside and meet them. Madam, no one is inside. Only sir lives here, who is not there. And I cannot let you go inside. Now what do we do, tell me? This is the home. These two will not stop. Finally, they reached there. Son, Salman, Arooj is deceiving all of us. Look at this. Ammad did a drama of 
quitting the job, although they are meeting 
all around the city. When is this picture from? Right now. Recent. Yes, but uncle, it is possible that this picture is from the time
 when Ammad was in our company. Look carefully. Look, see the date on it. See. Yes, date… It is today’s date. This means those people 
are still in contact. He has only quit the office. From where is this picture from? Huh? Where is it from? What difference does it make? What importance does this thing have? There is importance. There is a lot of importance, so that Arooj can be asked what she was doing with 
Ammad at this place. In this matter, where doesn’t matter, 
why matter. Why are they together? I don’t understand anything. I understand everything. Ammad and Arooj are planning
 against the company together, so that they can ruin this company. In my eyes my life matters 
more than this company, and I will not let it get ruined. I think the arrow has 
hit the bullseye. Salman said something
 really meaningful that my life is more
 important than this life. The business is going well. Yes, there is a problem 
in his life. This means that Salman 
will fix his life, so he will reach the real 
character of this story who has disturbed his life. Then Salman will throw out that disliked character from his 
life story and this way, we will have a happy ending. Amazing. Idrees, you have great brains. Did you notice something, 
Ammad? What is that? That guard was a little weird. He didn’t talk to us properly, neither did he let us 
go inside the home. Obviously, when we don’t 
know who lives here, then why would he 
let us go inside? And why would he 
have told us? Yes, but we should 
know who lives there. What will that do? We will find out who 
received the marble. Who received the marble
 is not our problem. We need to find out who the marble bas
 been sold to. Look, if you want that we find out who received the marble there, we can also find out 
from the company too, they will give us all the
 information easily. Yes, you are right. We will find out about that. Look finding out the information... ... is something that will 
only take a minute. But in actual you don’t want to
 expose your uncle. Right now, I don’t want 
to expose anyone. I have to look at the finance, identify the loopholes and make this system secure. Okay Sir you act really smart, what is this wrong thing 
that you did. What wrong did I do? What was the need for you to 
show the picture to Mr. Salman? What else could I do? Arooj is tightening 
the screws around us. Not around us, sir, around you. You forget. If something happens to me then you too will be part of it.
 Don’t forget. I will become a witness on
 the promise of forgiveness. You are disloyal. You bite the hand that feeds you. This idiom doesn’t sound
 good coming from you. Okay, don’t talk so much. If Mr. Salman finds out 
where this picture is from, then what will you do? I am not thinking till that far. Why is that? Things will not reach that point. The ones who conspire against 
us will get ruined before that. Think good things. Do bad and think good, how will I do that, boss? Nawaz, I am already worried, don’t worry me more. Boss, the worry will be where you
 have thrown the spark of argument. Mr. Salman must have reached 
home from the office. If our plan is successful, then we will have 
a solution to all our problems. Understand? The reality is that she is not
 bad character at all. You are mistaken. Fine, I will give you this much 
concession that when you liked that Arooj, chosen her for marriage, back then she was naïve, but since that boy Ammad has come here in the office, since then Arooj has changed. What has my life become? One worry doesn’t end, another start Salman, are you thinking of something? No, mama. You look worried to me. There is nothing like that. You are hiding it from me. There is nothing mama. I am just caught up in an issue. You just have one issue, and that is Arooj. Your silence tells me what I am saying is true. Please mama, stop it. I know the issue, you tell me what do you want? Every person wants the 
solution to their problem. You want a solution 
to your problem... ... in Arooj’s presence, 
in front of her? Mom, I am already really disturbed. Don’t disturb me more. Salman, what is the matter?
 What happened to you? We had married out of love, right? Answer me. That’s how it was, right? Yes, that’s how it was. Wrong! Absolutely wrong! I… I married you out of love. You didn’t. What is wrong with you Salman? What are you saying? I am speaking the truth. and what is the truth? The truth is you didn’t 
want to marry me. I married you forcefully 
against your will. Look, you are saying the wrong thing. Arooj. Arooj you are forgetting you didn’t want to marry me. You became helpless out of
 my insistence or else… Not helplessness, I confessed my love to you. I married you out of love, Salman and I am really 
happy with this marriage. You are wrong again. You are not happy with me. How do I make you believe that I am really happy with you… Then why don’t you I see all this? Why do I see something else? I am surprised. What is there, you don’t see it, and that which is not there, the thing that doesn’t exist, you see it. Really? What is this? Idrees Brother ! Greetings. Greetings. I was coming to you, I had to talk about
 something important. Go ahead, Mehreen. Brother Idrees, I am really worried cause
 of Salman. I don’t know what is Salman so worried about nowadays. That’s how it is. 
Salman is worried. You must know the real 
reason for it, right? No, Salman would know the reason. He is not telling me anything. I just asked him, he said it is nothing. God knows what his worry his. But I am sure Mehreen, only Arooj will be the 
reason for his worry. Even I know this, but Salman should also say this. How can he say it? 
He will be embarrassed. Embarrassed about what? Mehreen, you know he 
married Arooj out of her love, that too against your liking. So, then? So how can he bad mouth Arooj, that too in front of you? Meaning, what Salman
 is not able to tell me, the real reason for that 
is this embarrassment. He cannot call Arooj 
wrong in front of anyone, even though she is wrong. You people are really 
weird brother Idrees. At the time of the wedding, you husband and wife became one and you left me alone for this Arooj. You are right, that was our mistake. But if you want then we can make amends for it. Amends? But how? By throwing out this issue 
from Salman’s life forever. Your silence tells me that you don’t have
 the words to justify this. Since I have come to this home, I have only been giving justifications. Arooj, don’t try to change the topic. Tell me what I have asked. What is this? This picture is absolutely correct. Ammad and I are there in it. Do you even know 
what you are saying? Yes. I know well what I am saying. And you have no 
embarrassment on this? I ask you why is he with you? Tell me. You had told me to fire 
him from the company. I did that. Now this in no way means that I cannot even 
meet my friend. What is your relation with him? Tell me. Friendship. Loyalty. Loyalty or… Enough Salman. That’s enough. Because now if you 
say something, then we will have nothing 
left to speak in between us. What will you say seeing all 
that has happened? Be calm Salman, the matter won’t
 be as you see it. Aunt you are taking this 
situation really light. Yes, we will have to do it. But you had said 
this to me earlier too, that I should be
 lenient towards Arooj. But you were not
 lenient towards her. Look, I tried a lot, I made her understand a lot, 
but it had no benefit. Now you tell me, 
what should I do?
