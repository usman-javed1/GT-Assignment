Yes, madam, 
did you want something? Why? Is it necessary to tell you? No, no, I was just asking because you came to the kitchen, then you wanted me to do something. That’s why I asked. Yes, work… What is this being cooked? I am making soup for younger madam. How long will it take to be ready? It will take some time. Even little master was asking me, when the soup gets ready, tell me, I will take it for younger madam myself. Okay, this will take some time. So, you do one thing, 
I have kept some clothes of Idrees, keep them in the laundry room, 
so that they get ironed. Go. What am I asking you? 
Leave it. This is getting cooked right now. 
Go keep the clothes first. Go. Sure. Whatever Mehreen did with 
Arooj was absolutely right. One picture. She just sees one picture and says that
this is me and I am the daughter of this home. Just one picture. But she makes the claim with 
so much confidence, like she some other proof too. We don’t have to look away 
in this situation, we will have to face this situation
face to face or else we will be out of this game. The game that was planned for years, will get turned over in a moment. the water is above head. If we think more, we will drown. We will drown anyway, 
think if we get caught, then? You think that I am so stupid that I do something that 
I get caught. Never. What stupidity is this? Salman will go crazy if something 
happens to Arooj, to find out who her murderer is. and if Arooj lives, we will not have anything 
in our hands. Nothing. So, we will have to remove Arooj 
from our way. Even I want that because 
with Arooj there, we have nothing but humiliation
in our fate. Half the work is done, now the other half is left. Congratulations, mom. You are going to be a grandmother. God answered your prayers. Really? What is the matter, mom? Are you not happy? Are you happy? That is enough. What do you mean? You really wanted that I become a 
father and you become a grandmother. Salman is at home, still you are talking to his picture. I am just cleaning up, Sister-in-law. I can talk to him whenever I want. But there is one thing. When I want, 
I cannot talk to him, but when he wants, 
he can talk to me. He doesn’t get free from Arooj, she has him imprisoned. So, how is it difficult to set Salman 
free from Arooj’s imprisonment? This can be done. How Sister-in-law? 
Tell me. Look, when matters are not getting 
resolved with strictness, you need to be polite. With love, with affection. What do you think 
I don’t love Salman? No, no, you surely love him. Everyone accepts that 
you love Salman, I am talking about Arooj. You really have to take care 
of Arooj. In fact, you have to tell Salman how much you love Arooj, 
how much you care for her. Then you will see. What will happen then? What will happen then? Salman will praise you. And if Arooj misbehaves 
then you will see, he will drag her out of the home 
in one minute. If Arooj misbehaves with me, then my Salman will kill her. So, fine, you understand 
what I said, right? You just have to take care of Arooj. You have to love Arooj so much that Arooj too believes your love. Salman is your own, then you have nothing to worry about. Okay Sister-in-law, is that true? Yes, now do you know? Salman has asked Wasai 
to make soup for Arooj and he will take that soup 
for Arooj himself. But that will not happen. You will take soup for Arooj. Mehreen, think, when Salman sees it, 
he will be so happy. Sister-in-law Shaista, when I am asking Salman, 
then what is the need to ask him? So, don’t I even have a right 
to ask him? His mother is there, so you have no right. I am asking you something. I told you nothing happened. You people are asking me 
the same question again and again? What do you want? 
I don’t have food? I won’t. Salman, what happened? Salman, sit have…
Sal… Sister-in-law Shaista, 
all this happened because of you. What did I do? What was the need for you 
to ask Salman, you spoiled his mood. And brother Idrees, you talk about 
the office in the office, or else you know Salman never 
reacts like this when I talk to him. We at times consider someone wrong. But later on, we find out, that we are at fault. And the one in front of us is right. And today, I realized how much of a well-wisher 
Sister-in-law Shaista is for me. You really wanted that I become a 
father and you become a grandmother. Yes, but right now you become happy that at least you are going to get 
some happiness from this Arooj. Or else this girl has always given you sorrow. Arooj. Yes? Are you feeling okay? Yes. I am fine. Why do you think this way? I will get these thoughts daily 
till the delivery doesn’t happen. God will make it all fine. A mother sacrifices so much 
for her children. A child can never repay her mother 
for what she did. You are right. There is no replacement for a mother. A mother is really great. And you know, when a girl becomes a mother herself, then the worth of her mother 
increases further in her eyes. Arooj, you are missing 
your mother again. I promise you, 
I will help you, your parents will be found soon. Now there is no need for that. What are you thinking? Nothing. Okay, you know, I have thought 
of a name for our daughter. Really? You know, I have also thought of a name. Really? What have you thought? I won’t tell you right now. And I am sure everyone will like 
my name more. Okay let’s see how your choice is. You look really good like this, when you get upset, 
then I don’t like you at all. Really? Then don’t upset me. I upset you? And what about you going 
around like a hero? You are good at heart, but you listen to everyone, you get misled quickly. Okay fine, everything is fine between us. 
Yes? Wasai. Yes, madam. Where are you going? Little master had told me that if the soup is ready 
for younger madam, then inform me. So I was going to inform him. So is the soup ready? Yes. Yes, the soup is ready. Fine, I will take it. But little master… I said, I will take it. Come with me. 
Sure. Mehreen’s lost daughter Areej 
is Arooj? Who told you this? I heard Wasai and 
Arooj talking myself. What is the proof of this? I saw the old picture in Wasai’s room. You had made Wasai burn 
that picture, right? You look at Wasai’s disobedience, look at her courage, 
she had kept that picture safe. That picture has revealed the secret. Whatever has happened is not right. The one who we had put out 
of the game, she has come back to the game
as your daughter in law. Well done, Mehreen, you made my job easy. Everyone knows you are Arooj’s enemy. Now I will kill two birds with one stone. Arooj will die and Mehreen will be the murderer. Arooj, I was thinking, let’s go out. Yes. Let’s go. After all, I don’t know why 
I feel suffocated. If I breath in open air,
I will feel better. Fine, then, let’s go. Let’s go. Watch your step. Careful. Careful. I am fine. Where are you people going? Mom, actually, Arooj was feeling restless, 
so I thought I would take her for an outing. Okay. I had made soup for Arooj 
and I brought it for her. For me? Why? Can I not make soup for you? You can. You surely can. Mama, when we come back 
from the outing, then Arooj will come back 
and have it. No, no, Salman, we will go 
after having the soup. I will first have soup. Arooj, you were feeling restless, 
you were not well. I will stop feeling restless, in fact,
the restlessness is gone. She made soup for me 
with so much love, I will have soup and… Mom, are you fine? Yes, I am fine. Wasai. Yes, coming. Clean this, and take this. Sure. Shaista, I was telling you. I am thankful that your poison didn’t 
reach where you wanted it to reach. I don’t understand you, Idrees. Closing your eyes like a pigeon 
doesn’t make the cat run away. Before our game is over, we have to do something. When am I saying we sit here 
doing nothing, but I am not in favor of 
what you are doing. Okay, then you tell me what we should do. Have you thought if Mehreen finds out that Arooj is her daughter, Areej, then where will we stand? How many lies will be uncovered 
with this one truth? Nothing will happen. You just be smart instead of being
emotional. Use your head. I don’t have so much time 
that I think, I act in my senses. It will not take a minute for this 
whole game to get spoiled, and that one minute can also 
be the next minute. Telling the truth is not that easy, you just wait for the opportunity. Removing Arooj from our way 
is our helplessness, not our greatness. The great thing would be that 
she has no proof left with her. I had made this entire game
for my son, Salman and Arooj became the owner 
of the entire business. The game hasn’t been spoiled 
that much, your daughter in law owns 
the entire business. You are forgetting, before being my daughter in law, 
Arooj is Mehreen’s daughter. If everything belongs to the 
daughter in law, then it means that including Salman all of us 
are dependent on her. She had already entered 
this business, now she will come with 
much more force. Mehreen was right, what she did with Arooj was right. This Arooj deserves this. Mom, actually, 
Arooj was feeling restless, so I thought I would take her
 for an outing. Okay. I had made soup for Arooj and 
I brought it for her. For me? Why? Can I not make soup for you? You can. You surely can. Mama, when we come back 
from the outing, then Arooj will come back 
and have it. No, no, Salman, we will go 
after having the soup. I will first have soup. Arooj, you were feeling restless, 
you were not well. I will stop feeling restless, in fact, 
the restlessness is gone. She made soup for me 
with so much love, I will have soup and… Arooj, come on. It was just a bowl, 
so what if it broke? It was nothing normal for me, Salman. Aunty, addressed me like this 
for the first time. She had owned me. She made soup for me 
and I dropped it. Okay, no issues, 
the soup will be made again. What is there to be so sad 
about in this? Okay come on, get fresh, 
fix yourself. All this is not good for you 
and our child at all. Okay, come on, tell me now, what name have you thought 
for our child. I told you, I won’t tell you and you won’t tell me either. I will announce the name of 
the child in front of everyone and surely, everyone will like it. Okay fine, you announce it 
in front of everyone. You know what? We will name our child, 
whatever you have thought of. Be happy now. Smile. Really? That’s like a good girl. Now shall we go for an outing? Yes. Come on. let’s go. You were right Sister-in-law. Salman was really happy 
on my behavior. Salman had to get happy. But did you see Arooj? Sister-in-law, I had no hopes, she took the bowl from my hands 
happily and with love. You are really naïve, Mehreen and Arooj is cunning. What is the matter Sister-in-law? You never spoke like this 
about Arooj earlier. What happened now? I made a mistake. I am so sorry. I got late in understanding her. I always considered you wrong and took Arooj’s side. But Mehreen, you were right. Arooj is actually cunning. She along with Salman, wants to take over this home 
and the entire business. Did you not see her cunningness? She took the bowl from your hand 
with so much love, and then dropped it 
on the floor on purpose. Mehreen, you think yourself. Was that bowl really that heavy, that she couldn’t control it? You are right, Sister-in-law, I didn’t think of that. Now don’t think of anything, and believe me Mehreen and forgive me, that I considered you wrong. Although you are much more 
farsighted and smarter than me.
