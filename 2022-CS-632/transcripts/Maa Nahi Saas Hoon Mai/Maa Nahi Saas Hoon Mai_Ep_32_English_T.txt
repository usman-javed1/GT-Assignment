[45.28] Mr. Idrees and Mr. Nawaz will be here 
anytime now
[49.72] and these are all the printouts
[51.80] and it also has the details of 
the new project.
[56.12] Good. 
Good?
[57.92] I am the best.
[60.80] Umm by the way,
[62.68] if we praise our boss in this office,
[66.56] it won’t be against the office rules, 
right?
[71.12] By the way,
[72.72] it is against the rules to praise 
your boss
[76.40] and your job can be in danger too.
[80.16] No, no, don't make this mistake,
[82.88] I have to bring Uncle’s doing 
in front of everyone.
[130.24] yes, we actually need to bring that 
in front of everyone,
[133.24] after all we need to know where 
so much money is going.
[136.32] Don’t worry,
[138.00] we will find it out together.
[177.60] Come in.
[182.36] Hey brother Idrees, you? 
Come, have a seat.
[187.56] Did I disturb you?
[189.28] No, sit down,
[191.08] are you done with the meeting?
[193.64] Yes,
[194.68] meeting is done but there is a problem 
that has started.
[198.00] What problem, brother Idrees?
[199.92] There is a problem that pushed me 
to come talk to you here.
[205.56] You are worrying me.
[210.00] I am here to discuss something
[212.24] that I thought who could be better 
to talk apart from you?
[216.76] Is everything okay? What is it?
[219.76] It is nothing appropriate to say 
but what can I do?
[223.72] It is important,
[225.88] I don’t understand where 
to begin it from,
[228.52] I don’t have the words.
[230.96] Talk openly brother Idrees.
[234.16] Actually, it has never happened 
in our family …
[237.56] What has happened, brother Idrees,
you can tell me.
[241.92] Umm
[244.04] your daughter in law Arooj
[246.76] and the new finance office, Ammad,
[252.24] I am trying to say that there is a little 
too much informality between the two
[257.92] that I don’t find right.
[264.08] Do you understand what am I trying to say?
[306.44] Brother Idrees and sister-in-law Shaista 
has always supported Arooj
[322.20] but if
[326.88] now brother Idrees is saying
[331.40] I am sure
[333.88] he must have seen something 
that he is saying it.
[340.56] This is a very sensitive matter,
[345.84] if I accuse Arooj without any proof,
[357.28] something can go wrong,
[361.40] I will have to collect the proofs first,
[371.12] if this turns out to be true
[376.40] then Arooj
[380.32] we will get rid of you,
[385.76] you, who stole my son’s love, 
your exit is confirmed.
[398.28] By the grace of God, 
company growth level is very nice
[401.20] and monthly profit is increasing too.
[403.08] Every year the profit is increasing but…
[406.76] But?
[408.64] But what? 
Why did you stop?
[412.96] Day to day expenses is a lot that are 
being taken from the profit.
[416.80] So, at what point the overheads are more?
[420.04] Overheads are on lunch tea coffee etc.
[430.84] And what is the total expense?
[432.88] Approximately 6 lac rupees.
[439.44] So much?
[440.88] I know,
[442.48] because all the officer’s food comes 
from outside from 5-star hotels.
[449.32] Oh,
[452.56] so then we have to control 
these expenses.
[463.40] Okay make some feasibility
[465.72] and tell me how can we control 
these expenses?
[469.00] Okay I will work on it.
[471.64] Thank you.
[520.36] Boss,
[523.16] the situation is getting bad 
day by day.
[526.84] I am not getting any good news 
from you these days,
[529.32] anyway, tell me, what happened?
[531.08] Madam Arooj has asked for the entire record 
of office canteen.
[536.32] Why?
[537.24] Boss, I don’t know that but 
there is definitely something.
[542.36] There is something new 
every other day.
[545.24] Anyway, well…
[547.00] This well at the end of your sentence
won’t make things well.
[552.28] Things will get well 
they will definitely get well,
[555.20] the trap that I have set this time, 
there will be.
[558.24] You have played a move already?
[561.04] You have started to ask 
a lot of questions.
[565.04] Sorry boss,
[566.56] you were saying something?
[569.72] The situation is not Good,
[572.20] so I have taken the step very careful.
[574.44] Are you sure boss,
[575.68] I am afraid the step doesn’t get 
on the mine.
[579.36] It will, it will but not ours,
[581.52] someone else will step.
[584.72] Your confidence will get us in trouble.
[587.40] the trap that I have set this time,
[590.32] someone else will get into it.
[591.84] Both the cases against us are very strong,
[594.64] take care of it boss.
[596.60] Nothing will happen,
[598.28] the enemy will get into the trouble, 
understand?
[603.52] okay boss.
[628.92] What happened? 
Why are you surprised like this?
[634.68] Who is all this for?
[638.16] For you and your staff.
[645.64] Yes, but you already restricted us.
[650.08] hmmm
[652.16] that was my decision and 
this is my decision too.
[660.84] Wasai,
[662.60] go out and serve tea to everyone 
and get coffee for me.
[668.64] Okay.
[676.52] I am very happy,
[679.68] but why did you change your decision.
[686.36] I felt whatever I did was wrong.
[698.08] After all this is our staff and it is 
our responsibility to take care of them
[707.80] and then I thought
[710.60] that after all this office is also 
my Salman’s.
[718.04] Thank you for taking so much care 
of all the staff.
[725.80] We should also keep an eye on 
the people in our surroundings
[733.60] and we should take care of them too.
[745.64] Carry on with your work.
[754.88] She is a very unpredictable woman.
[768.68] Boss, I forgot to give 
the actual good news.
[771.60] Tell me, tell me, 
hurry up and tell me.
[773.64] Your food won’t come from 
outside from now on.
[776.04] You fool is that a good news?
[780.24] And who has given these orders?
[782.64] Who can? Madam Arooj.
[785.44] So then what will I eat?
[787.44] From the canteen, 
where we all eat from.
[791.36] I will never eat from the canteen, 
I eat diet food.
[794.72] Boss, the food will come from 
the canteen only,
[796.84] you know madam Arooj looks 
after everything related to accounts.
[801.76] I will see her.
[803.24] Is Salman in his room?
Yes.
[813.28] Boss, you will have to eat from 
the canteen only,
[816.12] you have enjoyed enough,
[818.40] now have food from the canteen.
[821.92] Sir I would have never requested you 
if there wasn’t a need.
[826.32] It’s okay,
[828.12] do one thing go to the accountant 
your problem will be solved.
[833.12] Thank you so much sir.
[834.72] Thank you.
[852.88] And you, ask the GM of 
Ahmed Associates to contact me.
[867.56] Uncle, what happened?
[869.36] You could have told me, 
I would have come to you.
[871.12] Please have a seat. 
No, it’s okay.
[873.96] Look Salman I have been a part of this office
 since your dad Waqar Ahmed was alive.
[880.04] Yes. I know that.
[883.84] This office is not the same office anymore.
[887.16] What happened uncle,
[888.92] you look upset. Did I make any mistake?
[891.44] We have restrictions on having 
lunch here as well
[893.64] now that the lunch won’t come 
from outside.
[896.16] But those orders are for everyone
including myself and you.
[901.20] But why is there an attempt to 
change the system of this office?
[905.68] Uncle, we are not attempting 
to change the system
[908.00] in fact, we are trying to fix it.
[911.28] Arooj wants to decrease these 
unnecessary expenses.
[914.20] But the company is doing 
really well Salman
[917.00] and I guess it is not your police 
nor Arooj’s,
[919.88] in fact you just have your signatures
 on those orders,
[924.72] if these orders are not from my end 
or Arooj’s then
[929.48] who is behind these orders?
[933.72] Arooj’s new finance office Ammad,
[937.28] he is trying to be more loyal 
towards the owner.
[943.60] Okay don’t worry, and by the way 
this is company’s issue,
[947.00] why don’t you directly talk 
to Arooj about it?
[949.84] I should talk to Arooj myself?
[952.92] No, never.
[976.28] Madam Arooj, I am emailing you 
the performance report for today.
[981.64] Come on Ammad,
[983.20] don’t call me madam, at least 
when no one is there.
[986.84] there is no need to get free
[988.56] I am your finance manager 
and you are my boss.
[993.48] Hmm, okay,
[995.52] my obedient finance manager,
[997.96] tell me what is the report for today?
[1000.56] the report is that there are 
overheads of 6 lacs,
[1003.84] and I have emailed the summary 
to Mr. Salman.
[1007.04] Why?
[1008.88] because he asked me to.
[1010.76] So, what do you think?
[1012.48] Will Salman make any changes to it?
[1014.72] He might
[1016.12] because you can answer it better than me 
because you know him more than I do.
[1023.60] Yes, you are right
[1025.88] but Salman is a bit moody,
[1029.32] he might just reject the whole summary.
[1033.24] that is possible.
[1034.96] Hmm.
[1036.64] For your kind information,
[1038.24] it’s time for me to leave so I am off now.
[1041.64] Okay, you take an off and tomorrow 
let’s see what Salman says.
[1046.80] Okay
[1049.32] bye. 
Bye.
[1058.72] Amna,
[1060.12] I have emailed some documents to you
[1062.52] I need its printouts in the morning. Okay?
[1067.00] And you must take an off and 
ask the staff the same.
[1071.12] Thank you.
[1077.32] Ammad? Oh oh.
[1081.76] He forgot his keys.
[1084.24] He won’t change his habits.
[1101.12] Ammad?
[1104.64] Ammad?
[1108.16] Ammad?  Ammad?
[1126.40] You are forgetting something.
[1127.96] Umm no,
[1130.12] no.
[1136.12] Uh, sorry.
[1137.56] Your habit of forgetting keys didn’t change,
[1140.44] you are still the same,
[1142.08] do you remember that you used to 
forget the keys in university times as well
[1145.28] and I used to take care of them.
[1150.32] thanks.
[1152.00] And what if you remembered them 
after getting home?
[1154.08] What would you do?
[1155.76] Would you break all the locks or…
[1158.16] Or?
[1160.36] Sleep on the stairs.
[1168.56] Umm Arooj. 
Yes?
[1171.76] Arooj, shall I say something to you?
[1177.96] Nothing bye.
[1180.32] Bye.
[1203.60] Your daughter-in-law Arooj and 
the new financer office, Ammad,
[1211.92] I am trying to say that
[1214.08] there is a little too much informality 
between the two
[1217.64] that I don’t find right.
[1289.32] Salman? 
Hmm?
[1293.84] Ammad was telling me that 
you asked for overheads’ files.
[1298.64] Yes, I wanted to see what have you 
finance departments put restrictions on.
[1305.72] Really?
[1313.80] So did you find anything
[1316.28] that our office did wrong?
[1322.04] Arooj the thing is that
[1326.12] uncle complaint about you.
[1329.08] Complained about me?
[1331.84] What did I do?
[1333.24] You have restricted lunch from outside?
[1336.04] Not just for him but the owner 
of this company too,
[1339.96] it means yours too.
[1342.28] Look I don’t mind it but…
[1346.12] So, then uncle shouldn’t have
 any objection too.
[1351.92] I am bearing all my expenses myself
[1354.88] so then everyone should.
[1357.76] And what should I do about 
uncle being offended?
[1362.12] ummm,
[1363.36] so then for that let’s do something
[1368.12] let’s make a policy there won’t be lunch
for anyone,
[1372.12] whoever wants to have lunch can do it 
with their own pocket money, simple.
[1378.20] Hmm.
[1382.64] What are you thinking?
[1386.88] It’s not a bad idea.
[1392.52] By the way,
[1394.24] if you are interested, I have a plan, 
will you listen?
[1398.32] Sure, go ahead.
[1400.40] Look, our company has controlled 
expenses worth 6 lacs,
[1405.32] if we give all the employees 
an increment of Rs10,000
[1408.88] and ask them to arrange lunch themselves
[1411.92] so the staff will get happy that 
we got an increment
[1415.08] and the company will still save Rs3 lac,
[1418.40] what do you say?
[1421.48] Hmm.
[1423.88] Brilliant.
[1427.96] You are right,
[1430.24] our staff will get happy too and…
And uncle too.
[1434.32] I hope so.
[1438.96] Sir,
[1441.36] Madam Sr is calling you.
[1445.08] okay, you may go I am coming in a while.
[1448.68] Okay.
[1455.80] Good idea,
[1457.52] I will focus on this.
[1460.24] Thank you.
[1506.12] yes mom? did you call me?
[1508.28] Hmm.
[1509.96] Now you don’t come on your own,
[1511.88] I have to get you called.
[1514.56] No mom, there is nothing like that,
[1516.44] actually I came back from office 
so was tired.
[1518.56] You tell me, what is it?
[1520.60] Salman, tell me this boy that
[1523.12] Arooj has hired in her company,
[1526.12] do you know him?
[1528.88] Yes.
[1533.52] How do you like him?
[1536.00] he is a nice boy,
[1537.20] very talented and hard working.
[1540.24] He gets paid for his talent 
and hard work.
[1544.48] What happened mom?
[1547.24] Tell me if that boy is important 
for the company or for Arooj?
[1554.08] What do you mean? 
I didn’t get you.
[1566.72] Ammad and Arooj are very informal 
with each other.
[1571.56] Mom,
[1572.64] they are very old friends, 
they were university fellows.
[1577.00] So,
[1578.56] shouldn’t the new relationships be 
catered while fulfilling the old ones?
[1584.04] Salman, when I say less 
take it as more.
[1603.36] I have cooked for Salman myself,
[1606.56] go tell him.
[1615.28] Wasai, I am asking you,
go call Salman.
[1625.96] Madam, Sir is not in his room.
[1632.24] Where is Salman?
[1634.52] Madam Sr called her in her room.
[1642.44] There is a limit,
[1645.56] this Mehreen has made Salman’s life 
complicated.
[1651.24] They argue in the morning while 
he is leaving for work
[1653.20] and also when he comes back from work.
[1657.28] Wasai, I am so worried for Salman,
[1663.28] there is so much mental pressure 
on my child,
[1669.48] and this Mehreen, no one says 
anything to him.
[1673.04] Madam, you get so worried for Sir Jr,
[1677.76] and why not?
[1679.36] After all, you are the mother.
[1683.44] Wasai,
[1685.04] you have made Salman play in your lap
since he was a baby, right?
[1688.68] You know my son is so innocent.
[1695.68] And now he has gotten 
in to this confusion.
[1701.36] Office, business,
[1704.88] wife, and then this Mehreen,
[1708.64] my son has been stuck,
[1711.28] he is stuck.
[1714.56] Go,
[1715.76] go do your work. 
Okay.
[1724.36] He cannot eat properly 
or have anything.
[1730.68] What should I do?
[1740.72] Mom, Arooj is his boss,
[1746.80] she has her own style of getting work 
from him, that’s it.
[1749.76] Yes, that is what I am saying,
[1752.76] Arooj is the boss,
[1755.00] there is a distance between 
an employee and the boss.
[1758.16] Yes, and that’s how it is
[1759.60] If that’s how it is then why can’t I see it? 
I see something else.
[1762.60] What do you see?
[1764.92] Look Salman,
[1766.64] I don’t want to see you worried.
[1768.56] Mom, I am not worried, 
I have no worries.
[1771.16] You are not right now, 
but you will be in the future.
[1775.16] Mom, I don’t understand anything 
that you are saying.
[1783.88] I just want that you don’t stay busy
in the office
[1786.44] but also keep an eye on the matters 
of this office.
[1788.60] So, Arooj is looking after this office.
[1790.68] You need to keep on eye on her only. 
Mom.
[1794.16] Oh wow,
[1796.36] so Arooj’s love has pushed you to speak 
in a higher voice in front of your mother as well.
[1801.60] Listen to me very carefully Salman,
[1805.32] there should be a distance between
a boss and the employee,
[1808.52] make Arooj understand well that 
Ammad is the employee of this house,
[1811.80] I cannot give you a bigger hint.
[1814.00] Mom, please, don’t say anything.
[1821.68] You are doubting Arooj’s character,
[1824.60] her and Ammad are just friends 
and nothing more than that
[1828.24] Salman,
[1830.32] I don’t believe in a girl and 
boy’s friendship at all.
[1833.92] So then you used to get so happy 
with the friendship I and Alizeh had,
[1837.20] you had no objections at all.
[1839.00] That is why I wanted to get you 
married to Alizeh, Son.
[1872.80] What?
[1906.32] She is making my son her defender,
[1913.44] I will see her,
[1916.24] I will see her.
[1934.00] I just want that you don’t stay busy 
in the office
[1936.64] but also keep an eye on the matters 
of this office.
[1938.76] So Arooj is looking after this office.
[1940.88] You need to keep on eye on her only.
[1942.44] Mom.
[1944.36] oh wow,
[1946.44] so Arooj’s love has pushed you to speak 
in a higher voice in front of your mother as well.
[1951.76] Listen to me very carefully Salman,
[1955.56] there should be a distance between 
a boss and the employee,
[1958.68] make Arooj understand well that 
Ammad is the employee of this house,
[1962.04] I cannot give you a bigger hint.
[1964.24] Mom, please, don’t say anything.
[1993.40] Salman, son,
[1999.36] you are sitting here in the corner
[2001.68] and I have been looking for you 
in the entire house.
[2006.80] Aunt, I am so worried.
[2010.36] Don’t take whatever Mehreen says 
personally.
[2012.84] How not?
[2015.68] Everything she says hurts me 
in the heart,
[2020.40] she says such hurtful things.
[2026.72] You know Mehreen,
[2029.00] she doesn’t like Arooj
[2031.24] only because you went against 
Mehreen and married Arooj,
[2035.96] isn’t that so?
[2038.76] Yes, it is.
[2043.16] Mehreen wants to get that office closed,
[2046.00] she still wants that.
[2048.48] So now you tell me what should I do?
[2050.64] You solved the problem by bringing
office to home, now?
[2056.60] No,
[2061.36] I think that
[2064.60] problem has gotten bigger than before.
[2071.00] I know that.
[2076.04] Know what?
[2081.36] Look son,
[2083.76] I won't repeat myself
[2087.00] but I would just say that
[2089.20] I can bear anything
[2092.36] but I cannot bear anyone being character
assassinated or an accusation.
[2099.16] That kills the peace and 
blessings from home.
[2109.40] You are absolutely right.
[2115.12] I have heard what mom said
[2119.56] but I will never believe it.
[2123.68] Never.
[2163.72] This Mehreen will never let 
the peace be in this home,
[2167.28] she looks for excuses to create 
a problem in the house.
[2172.16] That’s true what has she done now?
[2175.92] She does crack fire crackers
[2178.84] and now she has brought

[2192.00] By the way she is not wrong,

[2195.76] What did you feel?
[2199.48] That she defends and 
favors that boy.

she is frank with Ammad.

[2210.84] So what’s wrong,
[2212.92] they know each other for very long,

to your wish, it will be bad.
