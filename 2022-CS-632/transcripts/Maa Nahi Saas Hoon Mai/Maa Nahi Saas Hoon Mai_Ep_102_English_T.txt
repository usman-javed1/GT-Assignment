[28.60] Areej.
[30.32] My baby, be quiet. 
Daddy is here.
[33.04] Be quiet.
[35.40] What is wrong?
[36.96] Areej…
[38.40] Wasai.
[40.44] Wasai.
[42.60] Wasai.
[45.24] Where is this Wasai?
[47.20] Mom,
[48.36] come here. Areej is crying.
[51.12] Areej, my baby.
[54.08] Who are you?
[55.24] My name is Chandu,
[56.80] madam Shaista hired 
me for the job today.
[59.36] So, the child was crying, 
could you not hear her?
[61.56] Yes, I heard it.
[62.64] Then why did you not come?
[64.04] Madam has told me not 
to touch the child.
[66.84] Okay, go from here.
[69.56] Areej. Areej, be quiet.
[108.36] My heart is really restless.
[124.32] I don’t know what condition 
Areej would be in,
[126.24] would she have eaten 
something or not?
[128.68] I am really worried.
[149.52] Don’t worry like this, child.
[152.28] Her grandmother 
will take care of her.
[155.48] Salman is so cruel.
[168.16] He didn’t even think that
[169.60] how such a small child will 
live without her mother.
[174.20] Areej should be with me, 
right now, mama.
[198.00] Come sister Mehreen.
[202.32] See
[204.52] the condition she has
 put herself into.
[234.44] I know sister Naseema.
[238.12] She spent the whole night 
sitting on the bed.
[258.52] This way, she will get unwell crying.
[262.64] We should take help from the police.
[266.36] You are right.
[269.36] If we have to get Areej, then
[271.92] we will have to take
 help from the police
[286.84] or else Salman will 
never give us Areej.
[295.96] He is really stubborn.
[298.24] No, sister Mehreen,
[300.24] we shouldn’t go to the police.
[304.28] Why, master?
[307.72] Master, what is bad in that?
[312.48] Everyone knows Salman is 
a stubborn and crazy boy.
[331.40] Our police report will 
make him angry.
[343.36] But,
[345.36] this way, we will get Areej, right?
[349.16] Sister Mehreen, 
you are right about that.
[352.08] But he can do anything 
because of his failure.
[356.04] Anything.
[369.72] I want to save my Arooj’s 
home at all cost.
[373.12] That’s it.
[590.88] You are calling us cheaters?
[593.00] No need to argue, Arooj,
[594.56] You leave from here,
[595.60] don’t blow this out 
of proportions.
[598.36] You people have blown 
it out of proportions.
[600.92] Now the matter will end.
[602.96] I am ending this matter.
[606.32] You had the right to 
start the matter,
[611.16] not to end it.
[612.88] I will end it.
[616.88] Look, child,
[617.64] how she is misbehaving…
[618.56] Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future.
[622.28] Look here.
[622.92] Salman. Salman.
[624.48] Do you have no manners to talk?
[633.00] You are at peace, right?
[635.68] I don’t like it at all.
[639.04] You will find the marks 
of the slaps you...
[641.76] ... hit on my face on 
your existence.
[649.48] She is my daughter.
[651.24] I say, leave her.
[652.56] I will not let you bring her up.
[654.24] Leave her I say.
[654.88] Give her to me.
[655.36] Leave her.
[656.40] She is my daughter
[658.24] and I will not let you bring her up.
[661.08] Salman, son, don’t do that.
[663.80] We will sit and talk. Come.
[667.84] The time to sit and 
talk has passed.
[670.48] Leave her,
[671.24] I cannot live without her.
[672.20] Why can you not
 live without her?
[674.52] Did you not live 
without your mother?
[678.40] She is my daughter, 
she will live with me.
[680.04] You cannot do this.
[681.32] Salman, stop. Salman!
[699.00] On one hand there are my parents,
[709.24] who didn’t give birth to me,
[715.32] they only brought me up.
[721.64] But, they cannot see their 
daughter’s home get ruined,
[729.60] and on the other hand, 
there is Salman’s parents
[737.04] who in their greed for money,
[745.00] are ruining their own son’s home.
[780.56] Arooj.
[804.32] If you feel that
[807.40] I made the wrong 
decision to leave home,
[811.44] then we will go back home.
[814.72] No,
[817.00] I am standing with you
 in your decision.
[826.04] Now, whatever will happen,
[831.20] we will deal with it.
[843.84] I will check.
[950.16] Younger madam.
[957.36] Wasai, you? Is all okay?
[960.96] Where is elder madam?
[963.40] She is inside.
[966.00] Okay, you come inside. Come.
[968.48] Sure.
[972.84] Mama. Come.
[976.80] Mama.
[980.36] Mama.
[984.44] Come.
[991.36] Wasai, you?
[993.80] How are you?
[996.20] I am fine elder madam.
[1000.24] Are you fine?
[1008.08] Yes, Wasai, I am fine.
[1011.04] Come, have a seat.
[1034.52] What is the matter Wasai?
[1036.84] What happened?
[1038.60] Elder madam,
[1041.24] I have quit my job there.
[1060.04] Now I am going back to my village.
[1064.72] Why, Wasai?
[1068.76] I cannot live with those people.
[1080.64] Wasai, is everything fine?
[1083.04] Are you coming from 
there right now?
[1086.84] No,
[1089.36] I went to the bus station.
[1100.20] Reaching there, I thought
[1106.32] how can I leave without 
meeting you people.
[1122.80] That’s it, then I came to 
you people searching for you.
[1133.52] I found younger madam’s
 home with difficulty.
[1147.44] Wasai,
[1149.68] I used to scold you a lot, right?
[1153.12] Forgive me.
[1161.48] No, no, elder madam.
[1164.36] What are you saying?
[1171.20] Don’t embarrass me saying this.
[1181.36] Now give me permission
 elder madam,
[1185.68] I will go to my village.
[1188.48] Fine, Wasai,
[1190.88] you do go to your village,
[1193.88] but I will call you back really soon.
[1207.24] No matter how dark the night is,
[1211.76] its morning is equally 
bright and shiny.
[1225.52] You are right.
[1232.68] You sit, I will bring tea.
[1234.60] No, no, younger madam.
[1238.08] What are you saying?
[1241.12] Wasai has worked 
herself all her life.
[1258.04] Don’t embarrass me saying this.
[1261.96] I will make tea and bring 
it for you people.
[1278.08] Okay, come with me.
[1296.60] I am scolding her because of you.
[1299.20] Because of me?
[1300.32] Yes, because of you.
[1303.16] But don’t worry,
[1307.20] now she will not have to 
get scolded because of you.
[1310.48] Because now you and 
your daughter
[1312.16] won’t live in this home.
[1314.52] What?
[1316.44] Don’t act so naïve,
[1318.36] you know well what your 
beloved daughter has done.
[1321.76] Arooj didn’t do anything 
sister-in-law,
[1324.12] Salman was cheating 
her into signing.
[1326.56] Be quiet.
[1329.00] You are calling my son a cheater.
[1336.48] Your daughter is a cheater,
[1339.08] who played this whole 
game for this property.
[1343.00] But sister-in-law…
[1343.68] Stop it.
[1345.88] Now you and your daughter
 have nothing left to say.
[1353.72] You and your daughter
[1355.64] leave from this home.
[1358.36] What are you saying?
[1361.56] I am saying what you heard.
[1364.60] Now, go,
[1365.32] take your daughter and
 leave from this home.
[1369.80] Remember,
[1370.72] I am saying this really nicely.
[1373.36] Take your daughter
[1375.04] and go from here.
[1377.44] I shouldn’t see you here.
[1402.68] Nothing will happen. 
Daddy is here.
[1405.20] Quiet. Quiet. Areej.
[1407.76] Don’t cry. Don’t cry.
[1409.36] Mom,
[1411.08] is this the time to sleep?
[1415.00] What is wrong with you Salman?
[1417.92] This is the time I wake up.
[1422.08] Then you will have to 
change this routine.
[1424.76] Why?
[1426.72] Did you not hear Areej 
crying so much?
[1430.40] How will I hear her while 
sleeping, Salman?
[1434.68] Look,
[1435.96] I don’t want to argue with you.
[1438.28] I am just saying that you will
 have to take care of Areej.
[1441.16] Salman, son, 
try and understand.
[1444.60] I cannot take care of such 
a small child in this age.
[1448.36] I get tired.
[1451.72] You are right.
[1458.84] How can you take care of her?
[1461.16] You don’t have experience.
[1475.20] What do you mean?
[1476.80] You gave someone else 
your child to take care of,
[1479.28] then where will you get
 experience from? Huh?
[1483.00] You are misbehaving with me.
[1484.76] I am not misbehaving with you.
[1487.96] I am just telling you that
[1489.28] you will have to take care of Areej.
[1501.00] I have to go to the office,
[1502.20] I have to take care of
 the responsibilities there.
[1503.76] If I didn’t have to go,
[1504.68] I would have taken care of her.
[1511.28] You can at least take 
up this responsibility,
[1513.80] she is your granddaughter.
[1516.60] Okay, come on,
[1518.64] give her to me.
[1520.24] I will take care of her.
[1521.64] Did you have breakfast?
[1523.20] I will have it in the office.
[1526.92] Keep her here.
[1530.92] You go, don’t worry, 
I will take care of her.
[1533.52] Come on, go.
[1565.16] If we have to get Areej, then
[1567.68] we will have to take 
help from the police
[1570.40] or else Salman will 
never give us Areej.
[1576.88] He is really stubborn.
[1579.16] No, sister Mehreen,
[1581.08] we shouldn’t go to the police.
[1585.24] Why, master?
[1588.72] Master,
[1591.20] what is bad in that?
[1593.44] Everyone knows Salman is
 a stubborn and crazy boy.
[1604.00] Our police report will 
make him angry.
[1611.40] But,
[1613.56] this way, we will get Areej, right?
[1617.36] Sister Mehreen, 
you are right about that.
[1620.04] But he can do anything
 because of his failure.
[1624.16] Anything.
[1656.20] What is the matter, Arooj?
[1658.12] Do you want to call someone?
[1661.92] I cannot tolerate it now.
[1663.76] I am calling aunt Shaista.
[1665.64] Hey, she…
[1667.48] firstly she will not answer the phone
[1669.40] and even if she answers it, 
she will misbehave.
[1672.04] Why will she misbehave?
[1673.80] She is a mother herself.
[1675.40] Won’t she care about me?
[1677.96] If she was so sensitive,
[1680.64] then she wouldn’t have put her son 
in my lap for the greed of money.
[1686.52] I will still call.
[1689.60] Up to you.
[1707.20] Now, what does she want?
[1711.00] Yes, why did you call?
[1712.72] Aunt, how is Areej?
[1716.84] Areej is absolutely fine.
[1725.56] No.
[1727.64] I don’t think Areej is fine.
[1730.32] I can hear her cry.
[1732.16] What happened to her?
[1734.36] Children cry like this
[1736.28] and then they get quiet themselves.
[1738.44] They don’t cry like this.
[1740.32] She must be in pain, 
why don’t you tell me?
[1744.40] Why did you call me 
early in the morning?
[1748.24] Is this why you called?
[1749.80] Disconnect the call.
[1753.56] Aunt, tell me, I will just come.
[1756.56] Hello.
[1760.20] What happened Arooj?
[1761.84] What is that cruel woman saying?
[1765.72] Areej is not fine, mama.
[1771.12] She was crying loudly.
[1774.72] Now even Wasai is not there.
[1777.08] Who would take care of her?
[1784.72] I have to go to Areej.
[1787.52] Nothing will happen Arooj.
[1789.16] Nothing will happen to our Areej.
[1790.60] Nothing will happen.
[1792.00] Nothing will happen. 
Nothing will happen to her.
[1794.28] She will be fine.
[1859.72] We are leaving.
[1865.24] But don’t think that
[1869.60] we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people.
[1875.12] Mama made me…
[1883.32] But,
[1894.72] I will come back,
[1906.44] and I will surely come.
[1911.80] This is my promise to all of you.
[1929.60] You are at peace, right?
[1932.36] I don’t like it at all.
[1935.44] You will find the marks
 of the slaps you ...
[1938.08] ...hit on my face on your existence.
[1945.96] She is my daughter.
[1947.68] I say, leave her.
[1949.04] I will not let you bring her up.
[1950.60] Leave her I say.
[1951.20] Give her to me.
[1951.72] Leave her.
[1952.76] She is my daughter
[1954.64] and I will not let you
 bring her up.
[1957.32] Salman, son, don’t do that.
[1960.12] We will sit and talk. Come.
[1964.24] The time to sit and 
talk has passed.
[1966.92] Leave her, I cannot 
live without her.
[1968.60] Why can you not 
live without her?
[1970.80] Did you not live 
without your mother?
[1974.68] She is my daughter, 
she will live with me.
[1976.52] You cannot do this. 
Salman, stop. Salman!
[1988.48] Oh wow,
[1993.32] I can also do this.
[2001.52] At times, talent is 
hidden in a person,
[2008.92] you don’t see it.
[2014.84] But then such a situation arises,
[2022.84] that the person finds their talent
[2031.84] and then they get surprised.
[2037.68] Like I am surprised at myself.
[2041.56] Wow.
[2044.00] Very well played, Salman.
[2046.80] Very well played.
