Take this file with you,
when you go. Hey, they are some 
twenty-five-year-old papers. How long do you have them for? For twenty five years. When Waqar had put everything
 in Areej’s name, that’s the day I took out this file 
from the cupboard. You plan for the future, Shaista. You knew we would need them one day. I had kept all this safe. If you were there, we would have been living in 
a cottage instead of this home. No, that is not true. What do we have to do 
about these? You have to give these papers 
to the lawyer. He will redo them. I have spoken to Salman, he will coax Arooj and
get her to sign it, and also give her 
thumb impression. You made a great plan. I will talk to the lawyer today. You have to do it today. You know about Salman’s mood, 
it can change at any time. If he gets angry at something 
in future, then everything will be ruined. Got it? Fine, I will go. Okay. 
Goodbye. I am the owner of this business, 
property, wealth and I know this well. So, it is my advice to you is that
stop dreaming about it. It is only a matter of me 
going to the court. I will destroy your twenty five 
year old game, within minutes. So, the meaning of all 
that I said is that stay away from the life of my 
husband, my mother and daughter. This has your betterment. Now everything will be fine. Everything. I am not from amongst those wives who sits to cry and crib seeing
 their husbands in a relationship with 
another woman. I have a young son, now he will deal with 
all these matters. Salman? Why are you involving Salman
 in all this? He has to do a lot of work 
in the business. Why do you worry? You just said that, that woman is lying. Yes, she… So, we will see. Salman is coming home 
from the office. Pray that, that woman turns out 
to be a liar. Nawaz, come to my room. Yes, boss, you called me? Yes. Fix my appointment with 
advocate Mr. Ahsan. Boss, why do you need an advocate? Do as I tell you, don’t think so much
 in my matters! Sorry boss. Now, leave. I am thinking that Salman doesn’t 
like Arooj at all. Yes. So? The way he left upstairs in anger, and he is agreeing to us, why don’t we drag the mother and 
daughter out of the home and we rule here. You say weird things. What benefit will we have 
with these two leaving? All this will be temporarily ours. Don’t forget, all this is still in the name of 
the cunning Arooj. So, what do we do? First let all these things be put 
in our name. After that, I don’t care if the mother
and daughter die. Salman, I am your mother. Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me. Salman, 
I am your mother… Mama, no one is hitting you. What happened to you mama? Don’t hit me.
Don’t hit me. He is hitting me. No one is hitting you. He was hitting me.
He was hitting me. You saw a bad dream. Yes. I saw a really bad dream. He was hitting me. No one is hitting you.
I am here. Your daughter is with you. Yes, you are my daughter. You are my daughter. But, my son. My Salman, he was hitting me. No one is hitting you,
you have seen a dream. He was hitting me. 
Come, lie down. Younger madam, tea. Did Salman go to the office? No, he went to elder madam’s room. There is no need to worry. Young master is really embarrassed
on his behaviour. It is hard to believe it. When trust is broken once, it doesn’t get fixed again. She didn’t even drink her tea. I made a big mistake. I don’t know what happens to me. I made a big mistake.
Please forgive me. Okay come on, sit up. You are going to the office, right?
 Your clothes will get ruined. No, I will not get up 
till you forgive me. Salman, come on,
sit here first. First tell me, 
will you forgive me? We will talk. 
Come on, sit. Look Salman, let’s forget whatever happened. But you make a promise to me? What promise? 
I will accept it. You will not say anything to Arooj. If you two live with love, 
then I will like it. Even Arooj wants this and now she has become
the mother of your daughter. You are right. I promise, I will not say anything to her. 
She will forgive me, right? She will. 
She surely will See Arooj, I had told you, my Salman is really good at heart. He has realized his mistake. I am really sorry Arooj. It is my mistake. I admit this. I am really sorry. I shouldn’t have done all this. I accept my mistake. If you want you can punish me. What?
Hit me. I made a mistake. What are you doing? Leave me. Look, child, Arooj. Forgive Salman for my sake. Mama, you know everything, right? I know it all. But maybe you are forgetting. Salman only means happiness 
for both of us. Both our happiness. Please, forgive him. Fine. I have no complaints from you. Mom, Arooj forgave me, right? Yes. She did. I know her. I will not give you a chance 
to complain in future. Not me, Arooj. I won’t. Okay, I will go to the office. 
Yes. Do you find peace? A lot of peace. Do you know, mom, when I come to you I forget all my difficulties. After all, my son is my life. 
Hmm? My son is my life. Hey wife of mine, where are you?
I am getting late. Here is your tea. 
Thank you. Idrees. Idrees, how long will I live in this 
small home? And now I am not going to agree
 with this useless love. You, yourself are living in 
such a big home with your wife and son, 
that too with luxuries. You tell me, do you want to go and 
live in that home? Really? Can this really happen? Can this happen? Wife of mine, it is going to 
happen in a few days. I don’t understand anything. Hey, I told you I am coming 
from the lawyer. Shaista and Salman are thinking, I got the papers made 
in Salman’s name. Then? No one will even find out,
as soon as Arooj signs, everything will be mine. That’s it, then I will leave Shaista. I have had enough of her, 
she has grown old. I know that. After all, I am in your life. Yes, that is true. Hey, I have to get to the office. I cannot let Salman talk to 
the lawyer directly at any cost. Or else the secret will be out. Yes, fine. I will update you on everything. 
Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye. I searched for you all around. Why did you leave the home 
and go? I had told you to wait, 
you left everything and went. You know everyone at home 
is calling me a liar, that I am lying and 
no one came. You should have thought 
a little about my respect. I was doing everything 
for your good, and… yes, Shanzay. I have found Mussarat, I am talking to her. 
I will call you shortly. It is good that I got rid of Arooj’s advice. Now, I will live a life of luxuries. How can you be so stonehearted? She loves you. 
You know, she has not slept for two nights 
because of you… So, what do I do? I have not taken up the responsibility
of having mercy on anyone. Salman, she is not anyone. She has given you love for
twenty five years. She is your mother and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen today. Okay. So you tell me. Tell me, if I don’t call her aunt Mehreen, 
then what do I call her? I too have been brought up 
by someone else, but I still consider her my mother, 
till today. It is not necessary that I think
the same way as you. See Arooj, I had told you, my Salman is really good at heart. He has realized his mistake. I am really sorry Arooj. It is my mistake. I admit this. I am really sorry. I shouldn’t have done all this. I accept my mistake. If you want you can punish me. What? Hit me. I made a mistake. 
What are you doing? Leave me. Mama. I feel, you shouldn’t have a lot of hopes
from Salman. What do you want to say? Meaning, he can say and do anything. What do you want to say? I know you love Salman a lot. But don’t keep so much 
expectations from him, that you feel sad. Arooj, child, you became 
Salman’s wife later. I brought him up. I know him much better than you. Look, child, Arooj. Forgive Salman for my sake. Mama, you know everything, right? I know it all. But maybe you are forgetting. Salman only means happiness 
for both of us. Both our happiness. Please, forgive him. I don’t know why, I am unable to believe this changed
behaviour of Salman or maybe I am thinking too much. It is possible that it is only 
my imagination. What are you thinking?
