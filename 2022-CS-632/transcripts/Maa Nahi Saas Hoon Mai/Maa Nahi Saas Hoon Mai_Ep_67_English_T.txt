[28.68] Nature has brought me so close, 
Wasai.
[33.48] Me getting married and 
coming to this home.
[36.92] Seeing the picture in your room 
changed my life.
[47.48] What is it that I just heard?
[51.28] What is happening in this home?
[60.64] What secret is Arooj hiding?
[67.64] What picture were these two 
talking about?
[81.28] I will go check Wasai’s quarter.
[349.48] God blessed us and 
both of us survived.
[355.88] She got injuries on the head,
[359.52] she also has some injuries,
[363.36] but she still hasn’t regained 
consciousness.
[365.72] did you find out anything 
about the child?
[369.20] No, we didn’t find out anything.
[372.36] Twenty four hours have passed.
[376.20] God knows, some animal must have 
eaten her till now.
[380.04] Shaista,
[382.08] what are you saying?
[384.56] Say something good.
[386.40] I don’t know what condition 
my innocent child will be in.
[390.00] If God wills she will be fine.
[394.04] Wherever she is, 
she will come home.
[565.04] You have had this file for so long, 
and you have not completed the work.
[568.40] Take this file and complete the work. 
Leave.
[571.40] Okay, sir.
[580.76] Yes, Shaista, go ahead.
[582.32] Come home as soon as possible,
 Idrees.
[585.96] Is everything okay? What happened?
[587.72] Think that what never shouldn’t 
have happened, has happened.
[592.64] Why are you talking in riddles? 
Tell me, what happened?
[595.40] Idrees, you come home, 
I am not talking in riddles.
[599.80] I have a really important meeting 
in the office.
[602.88] Now, there is no point in 
any meeting Idrees.
[610.36] Everything will be ruined.
[614.40] You just come home soon. 
Please.
[642.44] Boss, where are you going? 
It is almost time for the meeting.
[644.44] I am going home, 
there is an emergency.
[646.44] Mr. Salman is not there either, 
you had to head the meeting.
[650.00] Cancel the meeting, my mind is 
caught up, we will talk later.
[655.28] The client is coming from Islamabad, 
and I should cancel the meeting?
[692.12] I feel really like seeing you 
happy like this.
[697.32] Always stay happy like this.
[702.52] I got the happiness of being a mother.
[706.12] Okay, what else did the doctor say?
[709.76] The doctor said everything is fine,
 nothing to worry about.
[715.08] Thank God.
[719.96] You know,
[721.80] whether it is a son or a daughter, 
I want that they are healthy.
[729.44] Thank God.
[731.96] May God always keep you people 
together and happy like this.
[736.92] Amen.
Amen.
[772.84] Did my son eat anything?
[774.80] I don’t want to eat anything.
[776.72] Why don’t you want to eat?
[778.36] Send away all the guests from here, 
we will go to our room.
[782.28] Okay, we will go just now. 
We will go in a little while.
[784.48] Mischievous.
[785.88] Son, Salman,
[787.76] come on, 
let’s go to our room.
[793.68] Sister in law…
I said come to your room.
[800.12] What is wrong sister in law Shaista?
[802.32] Why do you insist?
[804.36] Salman is already in a bad mood.
[807.56] His mood will be fine. 
Don’t worry.
[867.04] What happened? 
What is the worry?
[870.08] Idrees, worry is a small word.
[877.40] Now a big destruction will happen.
[879.96] Shaista, I am already worried, 
don’t scare me more.
[883.44] What is the matter?
[887.16] Mehreen’s daughter disappeared, 
right?
[890.28] Yes, so what?
[892.32] Do you know where she is?
[895.04] We know nothing about her.
[898.40] Now you take out this thought 
from your heart and mind.
[901.96] That girl is present in this home.
[904.08] What do you mean? In this home?
[910.92] Arooj is Mehreen’s lost daughter.
[924.96] Mehreen’s lost daughter Areej is Arooj?
[930.08] Who told you this?
[931.40] I heard Wasai and Arooj talking myself.
[935.92] What is the proof of this?
[938.04] I saw the old picture in Wasai’s room.
[943.12] You had made Wasai burn 
that picture, right?
[947.04] You look at Wasai’s disobedience,
[949.52] look at her courage, 
she had kept that picture safe.
[953.72] That picture has revealed the secret.
[960.28] Whatever has happened is not right.
[963.84] The one who we had 
put out of the game,
[967.36] she has come back to the game 
as your daughter in law.
[1020.12] Wasai,
[1021.72] keep this file in my room and 
get us good tea.
[1026.16] Yes, younger madam.
[1040.80] Where does Wasai keep these things?
I don’t find them on time.
[1045.36] Where could she keep it?
[1069.44] Congratulations, mom.
[1076.92] You are going to be a grandmother.
[1083.80] God heard your prayers.
[1088.16] Really?
[1107.16] What is the matter, mom?
[1109.88] Are you not happy?
[1119.52] Are you happy?
[1128.00] That is enough.
[1132.68] What do you mean?
[1142.72] You really wanted that I become a father 
and you become a grandmother.
[1150.24] Yes
[1152.68] But right now you become happy
[1161.88] that at least you are going to get 
some happiness from this Arooj.
[1176.72] Or else this girl has always 
given you sorrow.
[1282.72] Arooj, I have noticed that
[1288.00] despite mom’s strict tone, 
you were smiling.
[1297.60] What is the matter? 
What happened?
[1302.96] Are you jealous?
[1305.76] I am not jealous.
[1308.12] By the way, there was something.
[1312.00] What?
[1315.96] Your mood has changed
[1319.04] but mom is the same.
[1326.04] At times a person should 
make the first move
[1335.40] and if you make the first move 
in love,
[1339.64] you surely get a response in return.
[1345.44] Yes,
[1347.80] you are right.
[1360.36] Okay, I will go get fresh.
[1379.36] Child, take care of yourself.
[1385.64] I don’t want to break your courage,
[1388.48] but in this condition 
you need to rest,
[1392.32] and you are running around.
[1398.36] The condition and situation 
forced me, mama
[1402.56] or else I never wanted to 
put myself in this effort.
[1410.52] Can I give you an advice?
[1414.64] Yes.
[1417.32] Keep Salman aware of your matters,
[1421.96] he is your well-wisher.
[1461.96] Think something Idrees.
[1464.40] Think what we should do?
[1469.56] I am thinking. I am thinking,
[1471.24] but my mind is not working.
[1475.28] I made all this game for 
my son Salman
[1487.60] and Arooj became the owner 
of the entire business.
[1492.92] The game hasn’t been spoiled 
this much.
[1495.12] Your daughter is law is the owner
 of this business.
[1500.56] You are forgetting,
[1510.12] Arooj is Mehreen’s daughter 
before being my daughter in law.
[1522.56] If everything belongs to Arooj,
[1527.88] then including Salman all of us 
are dependent on her.
[1533.16] She had already entered 
this business,
[1536.08] now she will come with 
much more force.
[1538.56] I already felt that 
she is something else.
[1540.76] I had my doubts.
[1542.92] I am so sorry.
I am so sorry, Idrees.
[1547.28] I unknowingly always took Arooj’s side.
[1559.28] Although Mehreen was right,
[1564.52] what she did with Arooj was right.
[1576.52] This Arooj deserves this.
[1581.80] Whatever Mehreen did with 
Arooj was absolutely right.
[1590.40] One picture.
[1592.08] She just sees one picture and says that 
this is me and I am the daughter of this home.
[1595.60] Just one picture.
[1597.16] But she makes the claim with so much 
confidence, like she some other proof too.
[1610.48] We don’t have to look away 
in this matter,
[1613.56] we will have to face this situation 
face to face
[1618.20] or else we will be out of this game.
[1634.40] The game that was planned for years,
[1636.96] will get turned over in moments.
[1660.24] Oh my God.
[1663.80] I didn’t think this.
[1678.36] Idrees think Arooj’s bad days 
have started.
[1682.52] How is that?
[1686.04] Leave that to me.
[1702.96] These are the papers of 
Mr. Waqar’s wealth
[1707.24] and business and according to this,
[1712.56] now the owner of all these things 
is Mr. Waqar’s widow,
[1718.76] Mehreen and her daughter Areej.
[1721.64] What are you say, Mr. Lawyer?
[1726.24] Everything has been put in Mehreen 
and Areej’s name?
[1735.12] No, no, this is not possible.
[1737.64] But I made these papers on 
the instructions of late Mr. Waqar
[1742.92] and Mr. Idrees knows that I am 
the legal advisor of the company,
[1749.96] so madam, this is an entrustment
 with me.
[1752.84] I would want that 
you keep them safe.
[1834.48] You see, see what is going on.
[1837.96] The home has become an office 
and the office, home.
[1842.04] I am worried and you are happy.
[1846.00] Everything, that is done 
against Mehreen,
[1851.36] I am happy about that.
[1854.12] Thank God,
[1855.92] someone is fearless enough 
to teach Mehreen a lesson.
[1862.88] You are worried about Mehreen and 
you are not paying attention to what I said.
[1866.68] I am paying attention,
[1869.16] I always pay attention,
[1871.00] but you make me be quiet.
[1878.20] But Arooj always finds her way.
[1892.92] I am looking at my son,
[1898.12] and the frown on my son’s 
forehead tells me
[1900.88] there is some issue.
[1906.60] Look son, Salman,
[1908.76] I know you have a misunderstanding
 towards Arooj in your heart.
[1914.48] No.
[1919.08] There is no misunderstanding.
[1927.16] Beliefs are not wrong, aunt.
[1930.84] Child Arooj is a really good girl.
[1934.68] You are having a bad heart 
towards her for no reason.
[1939.44] Son, whatever doubts you have 
taken them and throw them out.
[1952.12] This Arooj is really stubborn.
[1966.48] See, she is standing in front of me 
after ruining my entire plan.
[1978.92] No,
[1981.00] how is this possible?
[1992.72] The same girl comes 
in the way again?
[2000.12] That’s not possible.
[2011.08] Anyway,
[2024.92] this time
[2037.40] is the last time.
[2050.08] Arooj you have seen Shaista’s love.
[2062.96] Now also see her hatred too.
[2112.76] Wasai,
[2115.08] what are you cooking?
[2116.44] Little master, I am making 
your favorite biryani.
[2121.00] It is cooking,
[2124.04] it will be ready in fifteen minutes,
[2126.44] till then I will make salad for you.
[2129.64] Little master, are you hungry?
[2134.40] No, I am not hungry right now.
[2136.80] Okay, then my little master 
must want coffee.
[2142.88] No, I don’t even want coffee right now.
[2145.04] So little master, you tell me yourself
[2148.08] what do you want that 
you came to the kitchen.
[2153.84] Do you remember,
[2157.88] when I was young,
[2160.24] you didn’t let me enter the kitchen.
[2163.24] Yes, yes, little master,
[2165.28] I remember everything.
[2167.40] I even remember
[2169.40] when you used to put everything 
of mine out of place.
[2175.64] Okay tell me,
[2177.40] what did you make for Arooj?
[2180.12] Younger madam asked me 
for soup half an hour later.
[2184.52] Okay fine,
[2185.96] tell me as soon as 
the soup is ready,
[2188.40] I will take it for Arooj myself.
[2190.12] Yes, little master, as you order.
[2202.20] God, always keep my little master
[2205.40] and younger madam happy like this.
[2208.72] Amen.
[2226.00] Shaista. Shaista, think once more 
about what you are going to do.
[2229.72] The time to think has passed,
[2232.56] the water is above over head.
[2240.44] If we think more, 
we will drown.
[2244.36] We will drown anyway, 
think if we get caught, then?
[2249.32] You think that I am so stupid
[2252.08] that I do something that 
I get caught. Never.
[2255.40] What stupidity is this?
[2257.24] Salman will go crazy 
if something happens to Arooj,
[2259.68] to find out who her murderer is.
[2262.00] and if Arooj lives,
[2264.68] we will not have anything 
in our hands.
[2266.72] Nothing.
[2274.60] So, we will have to remove Arooj 
from our way.
[2281.24] Even I want that because 
with Arooj there,
[2285.40] we have nothing but humiliation 
in our fate.
[2287.76] Then let me do it.
[2289.48] Let me do what I want to do.
[2291.96] Don’t worry.
