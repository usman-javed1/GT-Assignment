[22.92] Disturb?
[26.20] We are disturbing you?
[29.88] You have disturbed 
all of us, Salman.
[37.60] After Arooj and I, you
[39.72] have become the 
enemy of innocent people...
[43.32] ... like sister Naseema 
and master Shoaib.
[44.88] I didn’t do anything,
[47.60] and even if I have done something,
[49.60] then I am not answerable
 to your useless questions.
[54.52] I don’t want to make you 
answerable for anything, either.
[62.92] Just tell me,
[73.24] don’t you miss your mother?
[77.16] Don’t you miss her?
[80.24] I don’t have an answer
 for these useless things.
[94.12] And don’t you dare follow me again.
[101.52] Now, move from here.
[104.24] I said, move from here.
[281.96] Is it giving you peace?
[287.20] A lot of peace.
[295.36] Do you know, mom,
[298.28] when I come to you,
[301.68] I forget all my difficulties.
[308.40] After all my son is my life.
[311.00] Hmmm
[319.60] My son is my life.
[426.84] The sun has set.
[429.12] Arooj,
[430.32] sister Mehreen still 
hasn’t come back.
[438.08] God be kind.
[439.80] I don’t know where she is.
[470.48] Mama.
[476.04] Where did you go?
[479.64] I…
[481.36] I didn’t go anywhere.
[483.12] I went some place close by.
[554.68] Why are you looking away from me?
[563.76] Tell me, where did you go?
[566.60] I…
[568.08] why would I look away from you?
[570.56] Then tell me, where were you?
[574.00] I told you Arooj,
[575.68] I went to some place close by.
[579.88] You know well, you 
cannot hide anything from me.
[590.60] Then why are you trying to hide it?
[592.68] Tell me.
[594.72] No,
[595.96] I told you there is nothing like that.
[598.44] I….
[598.92] You went to meet Salman, right?
[668.12] I…
[677.80] I didn’t bring up Salman like this.
[687.56] You tell me, Arooj,
[691.08] did I bring him up badly?
[702.24] Since childhood till today,
[703.68] I gave flowers and toys in his hands.
[720.32] This gun…
[727.16] where did this gun 
come in his hands from?
[739.08] How did he start doing
 this bloodshed and all this?
[743.84] How, Arooj?
[752.28] No.
[754.40] No, my Salman is not like that.
[757.20] He is not like that at all.
[759.92] What did he say to you?
[765.84] He said, he…
[778.28] he was right.
[786.36] Maybe he did all this by mistake.
[788.04] Mama, stop it.
[790.28] I know what he
 would have said to you.
[794.00] I know well.
[805.88] And I also know that
[808.76] you have brought up 
Salman really well.
[821.00] You have brought him 
up like an exemplary mother.
[831.40] But he has lost his way, mama
[834.68] and there is no way to return.
[846.84] As painful this is for you,
[849.52] it is equally painful for me as well.
[862.24] But I feel that
[864.76] the sooner the two 
of us will accept this,
[869.28] the better it will be for us.
[893.76] I will bring water for you.
[938.80] After Arooj and I, you
[941.16] have become the 
enemy of innocent people ...
[944.96] ...like sister Naseema 
and master Shoaib.
[946.28] I didn’t do anything,
[948.96] and even if I have
 done something,
[950.80] then I am not answerable 
to your useless questions.
[955.76] I don’t want to make you 
answerable for anything, either.
[962.08] Just tell me,
[970.40] don’t you miss your mother?
[974.32] Don’t you miss her?
[977.32] I don’t have an answer
 for these useless things.
[983.64] And don’t you dare follow me again.
[991.04] Now, move from here.
[993.92] I said, move from here.
[1098.32] Arooj.
[1099.80] Yes?
[1101.88] Child, you are going but
[1103.32] my heart is really worried.
[1110.60] You shouldn’t leave the home 
after this accident of master Shoaib.
[1115.60] Nothing will happen mama,
[1117.36] and till your prayers are with me,
[1120.00] no one can do anything with me.
[1135.00] And even if 
I sit at home, then
[1137.76] how will we manage 
the expenses at home?
[1153.64] Sister Mehreen,
[1155.20] when will she stop now?
[1161.68] She will make sure she does 
what she has thought about.
[1165.76] And you people just pray for me,
[1167.84] that God gives me success.
[1173.48] What turn has life brought us to.
[1194.84] There must be a path
 ahead of this turn, mama.
[1202.32] And that path will surely
 be of betterment.
[1211.88] I will go now.
[1212.96] Goodbye.
[1213.84] Goodbye.
[1237.84] Sister,
[1245.68] don’t worry.
[1247.40] God will make it all fine.
[1253.40] Everything will be better.
[1286.00] We kept on getting worried here,
[1288.32] why did you people
 not tell us anything?
[1290.68] If I had told you people, then
[1293.24] you people would 
have also gotten worried.
[1296.88] Thank God,
[1298.56] He blessed us.
[1303.72] Master,
[1305.16] God has given you a second life.
[1308.28] This is because of 
the prayers of all of you,
[1310.76] or the attacker tried his best.
[1315.64] And he had also lost 
a lot of blood.
[1320.36] Thank God
[1321.84] brother Nasir’s friends 
made immediate arrangements.
[1326.60] If this was the position,
[1328.48] then why did you 
people come home?
[1331.44] So, papa was in 
a hurry to come home,
[1333.48] the doctor had insisted that
[1334.64] he should remain 
admitted in the hospital.
[1337.48] Hey, I would have gotten 
admitted at the hospital,
[1342.88] but do you have any idea 
how much it would have cost?
[1375.40] I don’t want to enjoy anything.
[1379.28] I want to give humiliation 
and pain to Arooj.
[1382.20] Sister-in-law Arooj has no fault.
[1383.92] It is her fault.
[1385.72] She came in my life and 
she ruined my life.
[1391.24] You are forgetting everything
 in your anger and passion.
[1394.04] And this is the worst
 thing about anger.
[1399.00] What? What am I forgetting?
[1401.32] That sister-in-law Arooj was your love
[1403.48] and you married out of love.
[1404.96] I made a mistake that I loved her.
[1412.48] I have forgotten everything.
[1415.24] Salman, you are trying to look
 through the eyes of your wish,
[1419.76] and this will not have good results.
[1422.52] I came here to talk to you 
about what is in my heart.
[1425.48] But you want to be a philosopher,
[1427.36] so fine, sit.
[1445.16] Greetings.
[1447.04] Greetings.
[1448.80] Is Mr. Nasir in the office?
[1450.68] Yes, madam.
[1452.72] I have to meet him.
[1454.56] Madam, what is your name?
[1456.04] Arooj. Arooj Ahmad.
[1458.32] Fine, I will inform sir.
[1477.96] Yes?
[1478.56] Sir, Miss Arooj has 
come to meet you.
[1482.48] Sister-in-law Arooj has come?
[1484.92] I am coming to get her myself.
[1486.20] Fine sir.
[1488.96] Madam, sir is coming
 to get you himself.
[1492.40] Thank you.
[1507.40] Greetings.
[1508.36] Greetings. Sister-in-law, you..
[1510.08] what a pleasant surprise.
[1513.00] I have to talk to you 
about something important.
[1515.36] Come sister-in-law,
[1516.08] lets go to my room.
[1516.96] Yes.
[1527.72] Come in.
[1529.08] Thank you.
[1535.24] Sister-in-law, please sit.
[1537.40] Will you have tea or coffee?
[1538.72] Nothing.
[1540.16] How, so?
[1541.24] Let’s have coffee, 
I am also in the mood for it.
[1547.32] Two coffees, bring it quickly.
[1552.28] Yes, sister-in-law.
[1553.76] What do I tell you brother Nasir?
[1603.00] Sister-in-law, 
Salman had told me.
[1613.00] Believe me, 
I was really hurt to hear it.
[1622.00] I tried a lot to make
 him understand, but
[1625.00] you know him.
[1630.16] Brother Nasir,
[1635.20] who can understand
 Salman better than me.
[1641.24] Sister-in-law, 
he is just a little emotional.
[1643.16] But believe me, 
he is not bad at heart.
[1654.36] At times he makes
 wrong emotional decisions.
[1657.92] What do I do with such
 a heart brother Nasir,
[1661.40] who is upset with itself?
[1671.40] Mama…
[1679.48] I mean,
[1682.28] aunt Mehreen brought up
 Salman with a lot of love.
[1692.52] Anyway,
[1693.48] why am I tell you all this,
[1696.08] you know the entire story.
[1703.76] I saw your ad in the newspaper.
[1706.44] There was a job
 requirement. I thought
[1708.44] I would apply here.
[1715.80] Brother Nasir,
[1719.80] I really need a job right now.
[1722.84] You please check these documents,
[1724.28] if I fulfill your requirements,
[1726.28] then please hire me.
[1727.28] Sister-in-law, why 
are you embarrassing me,
[1729.52] this is your office,
[1737.52] and no one can doubt 
your capability.
[1745.12] You know, when you
 had joined Salman’s office
[1749.24] you made his
 company profitable
[1757.48] and everyone knows this.
[1759.96] You just join my company,
[1761.40] there will be nothing 
better than this for me.
[1771.96] You joining my company
[1774.48] will not be my good luck,
 it will be my good luck.
[1777.12] Why are you embarrassing
 me brother Nasir?
[1784.40] But I will want to say one thing.
[1788.20] If appointing me 
will cause issues in ...
[1791.12] ...your relationship 
with Salman, then
[1793.84] I wouldn’t want to do this job.
[1795.92] Sister-in-law, 
don’t worry about this.
[1798.12] This is my office,
[1799.44] and I own it.
[1808.12] You join from tomorrow.
[1810.00] I will just get your 
appointment letter made.
[1881.56] The situation we are going through,
[1884.28] we surely have to steal happiness
[1887.56] and getting a job in situation
 is no less than any happiness.
[1892.20] You are right Arooj,
[1894.92] thank God.
[1902.56] What do we have 
to be happy about,
[1904.04] and what we don’t have
 to be happy about,
[1911.60] at times a person is unable
 to differentiate between this.
[1926.08] When a person suffers at 
the hands of the situation,
[1930.28] then they even forget how to respect.
[1938.04] But you have brought me up
 in touch conditions, papa.
[1947.92] No matter how the condition,
[1950.16] I cannot forget respect.
