Areej. Factory. The accident on the highway. The bracelet in Areej’s name and a factory on the highway and that’s where my parents found me. Seriously? You are connecting all these dots? but one dot is left. Which one? You take me to mama’s home. Fine, take us to Arooj’s mama’s home. Elder sir was no more. Elder madam got hurt in the head, and she lost her memory. Nothing happened to madam, she didn’t get hurt. and that girl Areej? What happened to her? Then that girl was never found. It was secluded place. People say that maybe some 
wild animal ate that child. Child, Arooj, what will you do with all this? It is safe with me. Who do you want to show all this to? Have you found someone who is calling you their daughter? There is no one else in this world
other than you who would call me their daughter. Then? What will you do with all this? I will do something with it. And if nothing happens, then I will return it back to you. Child, take care of yourself. I don’t want to break your courage, but you need to rest in such a situation and you are running around like this. The situation and incidents 
have forced me, mama or else I never wanted to 
put myself in this effort. Can I give you an advice? Yes. Keep Salman informed about 
your matters. He is your well-wisher. You are right. When the time comes, I will tell him everything. Well done. Live long. Great. Can I tell you something 
interesting? Yes. This is something even I didn’t know 
in all these years, but I found out today. What is that? Dad had started a project 
by the name of Areej textile. I am surprised who was that Areej, whose name dad and 
mom liked so much that dad started a project 
in her name. So, did you not try to find out why he named it Areej. I asked uncle, but he didn’t 
give me a clear answer. Younger madam, what happened to you? Why are you so serious? Did someone say something to you? No one will say anything. Whatever will be said, will be said after you speak. What do you mean? I didn’t understand. I didn’t understand anything either. Will you make me understand? Me? What do I make you understand? Who does this belong to? Areej. How do you have this? All this... All this is mine, Wasai. You are elder madam’s Areej? Younger madam. I have been searching for my mother
for so many years. I kept on looking, for so long. And see, me and her are living under 
the same roof together. Nature operates in mysterious ways. Wasai. Wasai. I thought I would come 
and see myself, what secrets you two are sharing. What happened, to Wasai? Has she gone mad? Yes, madam Arooj. Salman is your present, who you have under your control, but I have come here to find out, what family’s child are you? Do you even have a family or not? Whose daughter, are you? Mama. Hey, move back. Why are you stuck to me? 
Move back. Mama. What mama?
Hey move back. Why are you stuck to me?
Move back. Move. Have you gone mad? Why are you calling me, mama? I am not your mother. Are you mad? She is calling me mama. 
I am not her mother. Mama. Mama. I have been searching for my mother
for so many years. I kept on looking, for so long. And see, me and her are living under
 the same roof together. Nature operates in mysterious ways. Little madam, she is our madam Areej. Wow, God. Wow. Without a doubt, the one who saves is bigger than 
the one who kills. Hello. Yes, mom? Hello Salman, where are you? Mom, I came to meet a friend of mine. Why? All okay? Nothing is fine. I have told you so many times 
not to leave home at any time. But who listens to me? What happened mom? 
Why are you worried? Is everything okay?
That Arooj, I feel she has been possessed. She is saying weird things, and her eyes have become weird too. And she is hugging me 
calling me, mama. What is wrong, mom? When she doesn’t love you, 
you don’t like it. Now she is hugging you with
 love calling you mama, you still don’t like it. Mom... I don’t know what happens to mama. This boy will never understand me. Something is surely wrong, I will have to find out myself. Wasai. Wasai. Yes, elder madam. I will raise my hand on 
this girl someday, she is getting out of hands day by day. She has irritated me. 
She will make me mad. This girl has started something new, she is calling me, mama. Now you tell me, can I be someone else’s mother 
other than Salman? No. Not at all. You can be no one else’s mother 
other than little master. You go and explain this 
to this Arooj as well that if she calls me mother 
after today, then I will break her face. Elder madam, you don’t worry. I will just go and make 
younger madam understand. She will not call you mama 
after today. First she took my son becoming 
his wife, and now she is trying to make me 
emotional calling me her mother. Younger madam, 
what did you do? What did I do? You called elder madam, mama. She left so angry from here. If I don’t call my mother mama, 
then what will I call her. Okay, so you want to announce it. I had become emotional. After so long a daughter 
saw her mother, will she not even hug her? Younger madam, I understand your emotions. But you becoming emotional like this, is not the solution to this problem. What problem? If the daughter is calling her mother,
 mama, then what is the issue in this? Younger madam, you don’t understand. Elder madam’s health is 
also a big issue. The doctors have always told us that any big incident or shock can 
make her completely mad. Or she can even lose her life. God forbid. I don’t want to lose my mother 
once again. Then have some patience, 
younger madam. When the right time comes, 
tell everyone the truth. Now you tell me yourself, Salman, did Arooj do the right thing? Mom, you should actually be happy
that she considers you like her mother. Every mother in law, dreams of 
such a daughter in law. I don’t see such scary dreams that whoever wants gets up and 
calls me their mother. I am only your mother and I have no relation with 
anyone else other than you. Just Salman and his mother. Okay fine, 
don’t give yourself tension. There is nothing like that. There is something like that, Salman. Fine, I will talk to her. 
You relax. Yes, please, 
go and make her understand. Fine, I will make her understand. Did you take your medicine? No, I haven’t, I will have it. I knew that you wont take it, 
I will have to give it. If I get a new shock daily, then how will I get time 
to have my medication. Okay fine, you relax, 
have your medication. Here. Now you relax, I will go talk to her. Yes, please. Goodnight. 
Goodnight. Mama. Whoever wants will consider me 
their mother. Idrees. 
Yes? What is the matter? Since you have 
come you are constantly smiling. Nothing, I am seeing the circus
of the world that what cunningness people 
will innocent faces do. Who are you talking about? The same. Arooj. Oh my God. Idrees, I don’t understand, why do you
have an enmity with Arooj. What enmity do you have with her? I have no enmity. Then why do you talk to her in such
 a degrading tone about her? You know how much I like her. Yes. Yes. I know. She is your Salman’s wife, 
your daughter in law. But you could never tell her. When you know everything, then why do you oppose Arooj? Listen to what Mehreen told me. What? What? Now even Mehreen thinks like you 
in Arooj’s matter. Anyway, what did she tell you? 
Tell me. Look at Arooj’s cunningness, 
she hugged Mehreen. What? No, no, Idrees, you must have 
some misunderstanding. Arooj cannot do this. Arooj can never have love in her heart 
for an ill-mannered woman like Mehreen. What’s more is that 
she called her mother. Now you understand, Arooj? Her biggest enemy at home 
wants to hug her and take over everything at home. There is nothing like that. Arooj has this habit, 
she loves everyone. Really? Then why did she never call you,
mama? Who told you?
Mehreen. And you believed her? Why should I not believe her? I asked Arooj, 
she had no answer. This means that Arooj is not 
master Shoaib and Naseema’s daughter? And you see that those two fulfilled the 
responsibilities of parents well. They didn’t let us have a doubt. Shaista, doubt? 
Now I am sure. About what? That an abandoned girl can do 
such a thing that Arooj did in the business 
and home. I don’t understand these relations. If you called mom, mama, then 
what is there to mind in this? Mom at times behaves like a child. in future, I will not call her mama. How did you find out that 
she didn’t like it? I can see that from her behavior. But I don’t want that she has 
any worry because of me. Arooj, are you feeling okay? If you want, then 
we will go to the doctor. No, I am fine. You took a step towards mom with love and she insulted you. Did you not dislike it? Now I don’t dislike anything she says. She is really good. Turn off the light, I am sleepy.
