[20.96] I am telling you,
[24.32] don’t say a word against
my Mom and Dad now,
[30.04] Mom was absolutely right when
she said you are a liar.
[39.44] There were conflicts
created in this house
[41.08] and between the relationships
of this house because of you,
[43.08] all because of you.
[45.72] Look,
[46.68] there is still time,
[49.40] I am saying it very politely
to come and apologize.
[51.32] I told you I will not apologize
to anyone.
[54.72] You won’t?
[55.68] No.
[60.32] Arooj!
[60.92] Salman!
[64.48] Move back,
[65.56] don’t you dare touch
my daughter!
[92.40] You move aside.
[96.56] Move aside.
[98.48] I won’t.
[112.20] I am asking you to move!
[145.16] Mom, are you okay?
[187.08] Enough now, Salman!
[230.16] Come with me.
[235.88] Let’s go.
[274.32] Shaista, I am unable
to face you.
[277.56] What is this?
[282.20] Arooj hasn’t just let me
down in front of you but
[284.72] my own self too.
[286.32] I am being honest.
[288.68] Wasai?
[293.36] Wasai?
[294.28] Yes, I am coming, sir Jr.
[298.04] Yes?
[300.60] Go and call Arooj.
[303.28] Okay.
[307.04] Salman, my son,
[310.88] only you can retain your
father’s honor now.
[317.96] Nothing has happened
to your honor.
[321.68] You won’t get it, Shaista.
[323.68] At this point of my age,
[325.00] the only thing I am proud
of is my character,
[327.76] Arooj even took that away.
[329.64] Yeah.
[393.36] It looks like Arooj is quiet
after getting beaten,
[396.68] I can’t hear any voice
from Salman’s room.
[399.00] That’s what she deserves.
[408.16] We were living such a good life,
[419.24] I don’t know what was that
[421.80] cursed hour in which
Salman liked her.
[432.20] She ruined our lives.
[445.88] What is there to laugh about?
[448.36] I am thinking that
[449.72] Salman won’t like
Arooj at all now,
[452.20] yeah.
[455.08] So?
[457.76] The way he has gone
upstairs in anger
[460.12] and he is agreeing with us.
[467.32] How about we kick both mother
and daughter out of the house
[469.36] and we can rule here,
[471.76] yeah?
[474.52] What you say is so
strange sometimes,
[477.48] how will it benefit us if
both of them leave?
[481.44] We will just temporarily
get all this,
[485.04] don’t forget
[486.32] all of this is still in that
liar Arooj’s name.
[491.80] So then what should we do?
[495.56] Let us get everything in
our name first
[501.68] then both mother and daughter
can die if they want to,
[504.32] I don’t care.
[509.20] you mean the program to
get mother and daughter ...
[511.56] ...kicked out of this house
is cancelled.
[514.52] For now.
[516.84] I guess.
[519.84] Okay, come, let’s have tea.
[531.88] Wasai, bring tea.
[536.20] It’s good, it will be fun now.
[614.52] What are you doing?
[616.16] I even asked you not to
[618.40] but you still didn’t listen to me.
[628.68] Enough,
[630.12] we won’t live here now.
[632.44] You are thinking
[633.72] where will we go,
[635.32] we will go anywhere, Arooj,
[636.60] but we won’t live here.
[639.04] I have spent so many
years with honor here,
[642.52] now I cannot live by
getting humiliated.
[644.84] Okay relax!
[647.44] Relax.
[658.64] We won’t go away from here.
[661.96] And why should we go?
[664.28] So?
[666.80] what will we do?
[669.64] Don’t you remember
[670.96] what you said to me?
[672.56] This house, property, business,
[675.32] all this is mine,
[677.84] so when everything
belongs to us,
[679.28] why should we leave?
[682.84] These people won’t
let us live here.
[685.04] How wouldn’t they?
[687.52] Doing that is not in their control.
[691.00] Nothing like that will happen.
[694.92] Yes,
[697.20] you are right.
[704.80] But there is just one problem.
[709.60] Uncle, Aunt and Salman
have captured everything.
[716.88] No, not Salman.
[720.92] Not Salman.
[723.84] He,
[725.96] he just got manipulated
by all of them.
[736.00] Salman is not like that.
[751.64] He is not like that.
[791.52] What is your value in front
of my Mom and Dad.
[795.40] I am your wife,
that is my value.
[797.32] Shut up!
[800.04] All this drama that you played,
[802.28] everything got flopped.
[804.76] Now come nicely and go
apologize to my mom and Dad.
[807.28] I won’t apologize to anyone
[809.08] because I am right at my place.
[813.48] Arooj,
[817.44] don’t make me angrier.
[819.80] Else what will you do?
[822.04] What will you do?
[824.20] What will I do?
[825.76] I will do what you never thought.
[829.96] Wait a minute,
[832.80] let me show it to you today,
[836.44] look at this file,
[838.04] read it, read it.
[840.56] What is it?
[841.80] The house where Aunt
Musarrat lives,
[843.56] that is my Dad’s property
[845.48] and Uncle,
[846.80] the money that he is stealing
for his second marriage from the office,
[850.04] is living on the office expenses,
[852.36] tell me all this is a lie,
[854.28] all this is wrong,
[854.96] why don’t you say anything?
[856.08] Say it?
[857.40] Arooj.
[890.48] I am telling you,
[893.96] don’t say a word against
my Mom and Dad now,
[899.60] Mom was absolutely right
when she said you are a liar.
[908.88] There were conflicts
created in this house
[910.60] and between the relationships
of this house because of you,
[912.72] all because of you.
[915.32] Look, there is still time,
[918.96] I am saying it very politely
to come and apologize.
[920.88] I told you I will not
apologize to anyone.
[924.20] You won’t?
[925.12] No.
[929.88] Arooj!
[930.40] Salman!
[934.16] Move back,
[935.24] don’t you dare touch
my daughter!
[969.96] You move aside.
[974.20] Move aside.
[975.92] I won’t.
[982.60] I am asking you to move!
[983.76] Mom?
[998.84] Mom, are you okay?
[1015.92] Enough now, Salman!
[1030.08] Arooj has crossed her limits.
[1036.88] I can never tolerate that Arooj
talks to me like this.
[1046.04] I will not tolerate her
misbehavior anymore.
[1056.60] Enough is enough.
[1070.72] Sir Jr,
[1072.20] Madam is calling you.
[1076.72] Okay, I am coming and listen?
[1080.60] Yes?
[1083.12] There is no Madam Jr or Madam Sr
in this house from now onwards,
[1092.00] there is only Begum Sahiba.
[1096.08] Okay, whatever you say.
[1100.76] Come on, go.
[1119.00] All this is done by Arooj.
[1123.60] I apologize to you on behalf of her.
[1131.12] why are you apologizing
my child?
[1137.28] The one who has done
all this,
[1141.16] she should apologize.
[1145.48] She will.
[1152.48] She definitely will.
[1156.28] That to by putting her
together in front of you.
[1162.68] Today I have found out that a grown
son is a such a big support for a mother.
[1230.24] Don’t hit me,
[1233.52] don’t hit me,
[1236.52] don’t hit me,
[1238.80] Salman, don’t hit me.
[1241.32] Salman, don’t hit me.
[1244.08] I am your mother,
[1247.20] your mother.
[1250.04] Don’t hit me,
[1252.40] don’t hit me, Salman. No,
[1256.40] Salman, Salman don’t hit me.
[1258.68] I am mother,
[1260.64] your mother.
[1263.40] Don’t hit me.
[1263.80] Mom?
[1266.32] Don’t hit me.
[1268.24] Don’t hit me. Don’t ..
I am your mother.
[1271.08] Mom, mom, no one  is hitting you.
[1273.44] What happened to mom.
[1274.32] Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me.
[1277.16] He is hitting me.
[1278.44] No one is hitting you.
[1279.32] Salman, he is hitting me.
[1281.64] He was hitting me.
[1282.04] he was not hitting you.
[1283.36] You had a nightmare.
[1285.60] Yes,
[1288.56] a very bad nightmare.
[1291.00] He was hitting me.
[1292.56] No one is hitting you.
[1294.04] I am here,
[1295.44] your daughter is with you.
[1298.16] Yes, yes,
[1300.40] you are my daughter.
[1302.32] You are my daughter
but he, my son,
[1307.52] My salman...
[1309.64] he was hitting me.
[1310.64] Mom, no one is hitting you.
[1312.12] You just had a nightmare.
[1313.56] He was hitting me.
[1314.20] Okay, come, come lie down.
[1316.84] How can he hit me?
[1317.80] You try to sleep.
[1320.28] He was hitting his mom.
[1322.36] in fact, I will give you
a sleeping pill.
[1325.92] You,
[1328.96] take this. water.
[1332.20] I will get water.
[1337.04] He was hitting his mother.
[1340.40] His mother.
[1347.16] He was hitting his mother.
[1354.20] I have decided,
[1357.12] I will divorce Arooj.
[1364.92] Your decision is absolutely right.
[1367.92] This is what should
happen to Arooj,
[1369.92] she deserves it.
[1382.20] I agree with your decision, son.
[1394.96] But you will not divorce
Arooj right now.
[1406.28] Just wait for a while.
[1410.80] Why?
[1413.48] Why should I wait?
[1422.24] I hate her.
[1423.92] I know
[1431.28] but do you know
[1434.00] that Waqar had put
everything in Arooj’s name,
[1445.32] Idrees didn’t get anything.
[1448.20] Mom, I know all this.
[1455.52] Talk about the future.
[1456.72] If you know then also know that
[1458.52] 4 factories,
[1461.68] we have a farmhouse
in Hyderabad,
[1468.72] we have 3 more houses
apart from this house
[1477.36] and a lot of other things.
[1489.88] If Arooj goes away,
[1492.24] all this will go with her.
[1508.88] Look, Salman,
[1510.88] I have no interest in Arooj,
[1518.88] and you don’t either,
[1526.68] if not today but tomorrow
[1527.80] you will have a second
marriage
[1538.28] but son,
[1540.28] what will happen to us
if we lose all this,
[1550.04] just think that.
[1556.48] So what do you think
[1558.36] she will give all this to us easily?
[1564.04] Not to us,
[1568.44] to you.
[1575.64] I have a plan.
[1577.36] Come here, sit down.
[1645.00] You went to reconcile
with Salman?
[1649.44] That is what happens
[1652.60] when someone loves anyone,
[1656.16] they just try to make
it up to them,
[1661.76] I am sure he must not
have listened to you,
[1665.96] he is very stubborn
[1668.52] when something gets
into his brain,
[1671.16] it is impossible to
convince him.
[1677.84] Are you comforting
yourself or me....
[1682.56] ... by telling me about
Salman’s nature?
[1686.04] Both.
[1690.88] Our pain is love.
[1699.48] Salman will understand soon.
[1717.36] You are here madam Jr?
[1723.00] Mom’s condition is very bad,
Wasai.
[1731.00] She is suffering from
intense mental stress.
[1735.64] The one who has ruled
all her life
[1740.52] and now all this,
[1755.92] it is not tolerated.
[1760.48] Did Salman misbehave
a lot with Mom?
[1766.40] She has never been sad
about anyone except Sir Jr.
[1784.20] It has been so many years,
[1787.08] I have only seen this.
[1802.44] How would thinking help,
Madam Jr?
[1809.96] Yes, you are right,
[1814.92] thinking won’t help
with anything.
[1823.64] I am getting worried for
the people of this house.
[1832.48] There are a lot of problems
in this house,
[1836.12] there is no peace here.
[1840.52] All this is done by
Begum Sahiba.
[1854.92] Sir Rr is still sitting in her room,
[1863.96] they are talking
about both of you,
[1872.64] in fact, all 3 of you.
[1875.16] You never know what
they must be thinking.
[1884.88] How can a human being
be so greedy?
[1889.32] I don’t know,
[1891.72] money and wealth
[1894.72] are such things.
[1909.36] I was born in Adobe,
[1914.08] all this doesn’t happen there.
[1926.32] People care about each other.
[1939.24] People who live in Adobe
[1943.24] are true at heart,
[1947.08] I guess that is why.
[1950.40] Hmm,
[1953.24] and here,
[1962.48] houses made of stone
[1966.00] and people made of stone.
[1970.68] You are right.
[1984.36] But don’t worry.
[1999.44] Go and rest.
[2021.56] Brother Idrees is
a very clever man,
[2025.08] he must have done something
[2026.80] because of which that woman
is running away from her rights.
[2029.40] Yes, but,
[2032.56] what should I do about Salman?
[2036.44] What did Salman say?
[2040.84] He wants me to apologize
to his parents that
[2045.04] I won’t ever,
[2047.12] because they don’t deserve it,
[2051.08] it will be my insult if
I do this, Mom.
[2055.20] So, no one can even force you,
Arooj,
[2059.40] you are my daughter
[2060.92] and I am still alive,
[2065.00] I will break every hand that
comes on you.
[2068.08] I am scared, Mom
[2071.12] I don’t know what will happen.
[2074.52] Arooj,
[2076.20] don’t worry, my love.
[2081.48] Whatever my God will want,
that will happen.
