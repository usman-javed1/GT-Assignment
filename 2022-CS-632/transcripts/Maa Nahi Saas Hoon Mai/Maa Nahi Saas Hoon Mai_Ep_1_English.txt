Here you go, Wasai, distribute it amongst everyone. Yes, mama. Here you go. Today is a great day, Wasai. Yes, what else? Where you have bosses like elder sir,
 and elder madam, there every day is great. Here you go. Here, madam Mehreen and
 Mr. Waqar own everything. What do you mean? Mr. Idrees is just like that. Stop it. Stop it. You people just need a chance 
to bad mouth the bosses. Take it and go from here, do your duties. Salman, come here to mama. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come my child, my love. Hey son, get up from here. Now Mehreen will have her own child. No, I want to stay with mama. Absolutely, my Salman will stay with his mama. Shaista, what is the matter? What are you thinking? I am thinking what I am seeing. You too look that way. This is nothing new, our Salman is attached to 
Mehreen like this all the time. He won’t remain attached now. When Mehreen will have her own child, then our Salman will have no value, and your younger brother will put all his property and business in his child’s name. Did my son eat something? I don’t want to eat something. Why don’t you want to eat? Take out all the guests from here, we will go in our room. Okay, we will go just now. We will go in a little while. Mischievous. Son, Salman, come on, let’s go to our room. Sister-in-law… I said come to your room. What is wrong, sister-in-law Shaista? Why are you insisting? Salman is already in a bad mood. His mood will get fine, you don’t worry. Come on. What happened Shaista? See Idrees, Mehreen should be careful
 in this condition and Salman is jumping in her lap. Shaista, you know Salman doesn’t stay 
without Mehreen even for a moment. Leave his hand. Yes, mama. Come on. Come on. My son. Enough. Stop it. Stop it. 
Stop playing the drum. Elder madam is going to have
 a big happiness in her home. Come dance with me. Come on. Play the music. Wasai. Yes, madam? Now do you want to dance all night? Hey, tonight is a happy night, so I cannot control my emotions. keep your emotions under control. Shaista, what happened? Let her celebrate her happiness. You know, Waqar and Mehreen are getting
 happiness after six years. Mama, I was just saying it, because so much time has passed,
 let’s start the tradition. Yes, you are right about that. Wasai, come on bring everything
 for the tradition. Mama, I have already kept the 
things on the table. Okay. Come on, children, 
let’s do the tradition. Come on. Elder madam, come to the room with me. Rest a little. You must be tired. Wasai, you go right now, I will sit here for a while. I find peace here. Okay, as you wish. Call me when you want to go. Okay. Shaista, I don’t understand why you 
have adopted this behavior. You even created a mess in 
Mehreen’s baby shower. Did you not see how my Salman wanted 
Mehreen’s attention, and what did Mehreen do? She totally ignored Salman. There is nothing like that. Shaista, you asked him
 get off Mehreen’s lap, although she didn’t agree to it. Fine, I am taking it wrong. I am lying. I didn’t say anything like that. But, yes, I do want to know 
what you are thinking nowadays. My Salman was the only 
child of this family and now? Now even Mehreen will be a mother. What does this mean? It is something straightforward, Idrees. My Salman was the only 
heir of this home. Going forward he was to get this property, 
business, everything. Meaning, we would get it. But, will this happen now? That’s why I am saying this. Shaista, how can you
 think so negative? Earlier, there was
 nothing like this. Earlier, Salman was 
not ignored like this either. He was the star of everyone’s eyes. What difference does that make? It makes a difference, but not to you, I think. You are happy working as a
 GM in your brother’s office, so you stay happy. What are you thinking? I am thinking about 
God’s greatness. I was completely hopeless. But Mehreen, I have never felt you to be hopeless. No children and no hope 
for six years of marriage. A woman wishing to be a mother, gets disappointed. Okay, thank God now that He didn’t let your hope die. He listened to our prayers. When a woman has a child in her lap, then she considers 
herself to be complete. When did you let Salman get off your 
lap in these six years of not having a child? He is not this attached to his mother,
 sister-in-law Shaista. He cannot be either. I don’t know why, there is a weird attachment 
between me and Salman. There is a bond, and I am unable to understand what and why the strength of it is. Okay, you didn’t tell me, what should we name our future child. Good question, if it is a son, then I will name him, and if we have a daughter, then you can name her. Okay. But what happened in the 
function right now, I didn’t understand this behavior 
of sister-in-law Shahita. I admit, Salman is her son but… Salman is also my son. If you want, you can ask Salman. Yes, Salman is your son. Wasai, come here. Yes, madam. Mehreen is having a child and you are celebrating. Why? I get happy in every 
happiness of this home. That’s it, no need to talk a lot. You were dancing with 
a lot of enthusiasm. If I tell you to do the work at home, you have pain in your knees. I forgot all my pain in elder 
madam’s happiness. That’s what I am asking, what are you getting 
so happy about? Madam, I didn’t have any children of my own, when I heard of the happiness 
of a child coming to this home, I couldn’t stop myself. Whatever. Careful Mehreen. Careful. Hey, I am walking carefully. Careful. Careful. I was coming after you, 
what was the hurry? What is wrong with you people? You have all started to doing this. Come on. Come on. Careful. Careful. Careful. Hey, Waqar, it is not right for Mehreen to climb up
 and down the stairs like this. In this condition, I have told you people to come
 stay in the room downstairs. Hey mama, only if your 
daughter-in-law agrees. Why Mehreen? Hey mama, I am absolutely fine in my room. I feel comfortable. Hey child, the whole home is yours. Mama, ’
the goats for charity are here. Come on. Okay, you go ahead we will come. Sure. Shall we go? Come child. Yes. Yes. Careful. Slowly. Be careful. Slowly. . Slowly. Slowly. Slowly Come, mama. Come put your hand on both of them. I pray to God everything goes smoothly. Wasai, see, get both
 the goats slaughtered and have the meat 
distributed in the poor. Sure. Yes. Come on. Come on. Be careful... It feels as though a unique child
 is going to come in this home. I will not let anyone take
 my Salman’s place so easily. Mehreen, here you go, cold juice. Hey sister-in-law, 
why did you bother? You should have asked Wasai, 
she would have brought it. Where is Wasai? Hey, where is the botheration in this? Wasai was busy in the kitchen, I care about your health, 
so I brought it. Stop Mehreen. Take this. Do you know the condition 
she is in, right? In such a condition she 
shouldn’t drink anything cold. Wasai. Wasai. Yes, mama, coming. I don’t know what the hell 
she is busy with all the time. Yes? Mehreen, you will not eat or drink anything without asking me in future. Do you understand? No problem, sister-in-law, Shaista. You know, mama knows better. I haven’t seen this often that the younger brother is
 a great businessman, and the elder brother is just 
a manager in the same business. You are right. See, Mr. Waqar is 
a genius businessman and Mr. Waqar has kept
 Mr. Idress as a manager, based on the work he knows and all this is a big thing. It is a big miracle that a brother cares 
this much for another brother. Absolutely sir. Listen, what is the matter? Are you feeling okay? Leave how I feel, in this home, only how 
Mehreen feels is important. Meaning? Meaning, today mama doubted me. What doubt? What did mama say? You tell me yourself, am I someone’s enemy here? I am the elder daughter-in-law 
of this home, I have given this home its first heir. I never wanted bad for Mehreen. What has happened? Tell me this. I was trying to give juice to Mehreen, so mama stopped me. That was juice Idrees, and nothing else. What did mama feel that I added poison to it? What does mama think that I am the enemy of Mehreen
 or her future child. There was never so much friction
 in the environment of this home. Earlier, mama had never given
 importance to Mehreen over me, and nor did she ignore
 Salman like this. Come in. Do you want something else? No, keep sir’s coat. Sure. Waqar, you just came from the office, you must be tired. You should rest. But you are insisting on going out. Careful. Careful. I am not tired at all, Mehreen. You stay locked up in home all day long, you should step out of the home, this will improve your mood. I want to spent time with you. Fine, it is useless to argue with you. Come on, come. Mama. Mama. I too want to come along. Yes, come on. Let’s go. Salman, you are not going anywhere. Why do you need to go? Come on. No, I want to go with mama. I told you that you are 
not going anywhere, come with me. Hey sister-in-law, what is wrong with you? If Salman wants to come with me, 
then what is bad in that? Come on, Salman, we will go. Careful. Careful, Mehreen. Wasai, I have been
 noticing for a few days, you are not focusing on work at all. You don’t clean well, nothing at all. You know I don’t like dirt at all. You leave work whenever you want. Mama, with you here, the behavior of the younger ones 
is changing towards the elders. Why? What happened Shaista? You know, I too am noticing changing
 behaviors in this home, but I didn’t say it to anyone. Mama, you know, Salman is my son. Hey, everyone knows that. But what you have forgotten is that Salman and Mehreen 
love each other a lot. You have just given birth to Salman, I think you forgot this. Salman is a child and children do what they want. So, mama, don’t you think that when Mehreen has her own child, then will she still give 
Salman so much importance? Salman will have no worth, mama. And you think if Salman is ignored then his personality will get shattered. You stop thinking this Shaista, no one will ignore him. I apologize mama, but what you think doesn’t seem to be happening. It is your job to make 
Shaista understand, she is spoiling the environment of this 
home with her useless insistence. But mama, she will not want what
 is bad for Mehreen. I never thought this. But I cannot ignore being careful. Mama, then the thing has
 come to the same point. The glass has juice,
 it didn’t have poison. I think Shaista made you 
memorize your lesson well. Mama, what direction are you
 taking the conversation to? Firstly, cold diet is not 
suitable for Mehreen and when things have come to this, then I have no hesitation in saying this, that I fear Shaista’s behavior now. What fear mama? The fear of being envious. Making yourself be seen as great 
and degrading someone, this is what leads to envy. But I will not take any risk till the
 birth of Mehreen’s first child. Salman, wake up. Come on. Careful. Careful, Mehreen. Careful. Take out Salman,
 I think he slept at the back. Salman, get up son. Come on. We are home. Wake up. Come on. Come on. Come on, my son is tired. Come. Come on, are you sleepy? Waqar, hand him over to me. Come on. Sure, sister-in-law. Sister-in-law where are you taking Salman? Salman sleeps with us. Yes, but from today he will sleep in his own room. Sister-in-law, he cannot sleep without me. Now Salman should get 
used to sleeping with you, and you too. Come on. Hey child… Mama, what happened to
 sister-in-law Shaista? Hey child, why do you tire yourself? Don’t take any tension in this condition. Waqar, son you take Mehreen. Take her carefully. Yes, mama. Mama, I will sleep with you. Yes, my love, we will both sleep together. My child. Shall we go now? Come on. Goodnight mama. Goodnight son. Elder madam, careful. Salman. Salman. Sal…. Salman. Mehreen. Salman. Elder madam, Salman. Madam, come to your senses. Salman is fine, Mehreen. Salman, is fine. Mehreen. Elder madam. Elder madam, 
get up. Elder madam… Grandma, I want to go to mama. Child. You know mama is not well. Grandma, what happened to my mama? Child, mama is not well, she will come. If you insist like this, then mama will get worried, child. Doctor, how is Mehreen? Sir, the thing is that the patient
 is not in a good condition, she needs intensive care. There are some complications, but we are trying our best to save the life of both 
the mother and child. Doctor, do anything, 
try to save them. Please. We are putting in all our effort, you people too pray, please, and don’t worry. Fine doctor, thank you very much. Mama, my mother is calling. I will just come. Pray for mama, child. Don’t worry, son. Greetings mama. Yes, I am still in the hospital. No news till now. No good news till now. You just pray. Okay, I will talk to you later. 
Okay? Bye. Whatever is happening, at least it is best for my Salman. I feel time and fate is blessing my wish. Poor things, they are all waiting for good news. They don’t even know that the good news they are waiting for died on the way a long time back Shaista, where is everyone? Yes, there. Come on. Come. Waqar, any news? Brother till now…. Doctor, please give me a good news. Congratulations to you all, it is a girl. But doctor, how is 
my daughter-in-law, Mehreen? She is also fine. She is a little traumatized, but she will recover gradually. And maybe… Maybe what, doctor? Maybe she can 
never be a mother now. But still congratulations 
on having a cute little baby girl. We will shift the patient
 to the ward soon. Thank you doctor. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations, we have 
a blessing in our home. Congratulations. It is a good news. Wasai, tell the driver 
to arrange sweets. Yes, elder sir, I will just get it. Congratulations to all of you. Here you go, Mr. Hashim. Give the entire staff 
a bonus salary tomorrow and this other cheque
 for the orphanage. Fine, sir. Sir, once again congratulations. Thank you very much. Do have food. Wasai, have food served 
for Mr. Hashim. Thank you. Yes, sir. Hey Wasai, wait. I got these clothes for you people. This has your dress as well, and whatever is left, give it to the rest of the servants. Thank you very much, mama. Waqar, son, I don’t see Mehreen. Mama, she is resting. Waqar, Mehreen looks 
really weak, take care. Sure. , Mama, I have some work,
 I will leave. Okay son. Son, Waqar, seeing you and Mehreen happy has made my heart happy. Happiness has returned 
to this home after long. Yes, mama, it is all because of your prayers. Live long. May God protect you, my life. My life. Oh, you are sleepy. My child. Mama’s love is sleepy. Lovely baby. Elder madam, if you allow me, 
then can I say something? Go ahead, Wasai. If you don’t mind, then can I pick up little 
madam in my arms? What are you saying, Wasai? Now you have to take care of her. Thank you very much. Go. Go to Wasai Bi. Little madam is really beautiful. May God protect her 
from the evil eye. Amen. Amen. Here you go, madam. That’s it, Wasai? Yes. Come. Come. Mama’s love. That’s it, Wasai is tired. Are you happy now, Wasai? Yes, yes, thank you very much. Actually, I don’t have a child, so seeing the child I couldn’t resist. No problem Wasai, you will take care of her. Yes, sure. Do you want it? Do you want it? Mama’s love. Oh, okay. Salman, son, why are you not sleepy? 
Sleep my son. No, I have to go to mama. Why do you want to go to mama? There is no place for you there. How many times have 
I made you understand? Come on, go to sleepy. No, I said I will go to mama. Child, she is not your mama… I mean, your mama is not well, you can go meet her tomorrow. No, I have to go to mama right now. Salman. Salman, stop, son. Salman. Let him go, Shaista. He will not stop. He is really attached to Mehreen. No issues. She is very sleepy. It is time to sleep. Time to sleep. Mama, can I sleep here? Why not Salman? Come on.
 Come to mama. One second. One second my love. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come lie down here, love. Here you go. Look at this, mama. Areej. It is so pretty. See, Mehreen. It is a very pretty name. So, you gave her the 
name you liked, right? Yes, because Areej is a pretty name. Right, mama? Yes, it is a pretty name, child. Now our entire home will smell of her scent. Here you go, mama, make Areej wear it 
with your own hands. I will remove it. My little doll. Here you go. Sir, the documents are ready. You have a look at them once, then I will get them signed by the lawyer. Fine, Mr. Hashim. But did you get it checked
 by the legal committee? Yes, sir, I had it checked. Waqar, what are documents for? I have put all my property, my business,
 this home in Areej’s name. You put everything in Areej’s name? Yes, Mehreen child, even if you give your life for your
 daughters, it is not enough. The daughters are such beings. and my Salman? Don’t worry, Mehreen, I will not do any injustice with him either. Okay sir, me and Mr. Idrees are going to the site, so we will go now. Fine, Mr. Hashim, you reach, 
we are coming. Okay sir. Thank you. Where are you going, son? Today we are going to lay the foundation
 of our new factory, Areej Textile. [00:44: ]and my daughter
 too will come with us. Shaista, what happened? 
Why are you so angry? Nothing happened. If nothing happened, then why is madam so upset? What is the matter? What do you want? I have a fire burning in my heart and there is no smoke. Yes, that is true. If you tell me, then I will also help 
you in putting out the fire. The thing is that Waqar and Mehreen 
just love Salman for show. They just call him their son. Idrees my son is not a toy, nor is he a decoration piece with which Mehreen and 
Waqar want to use to spend time. That’s not true,
 they really love Salman. Leave it, they couldn’t even put a 100-yard 
plot in Salman’s name and what all are they 
not giving to their daughter. Can you not see that? What is wrong, Shaista? All the properties are in
 Waqar’s name, he will put it in his child’s name, right? You have expectations for no reason. When does this happen? Right now, you won’t understand me, but if Salman attaches 
his hope with this love, then you will get the answer 
to all my questions. Okay, come on. All the property, business, factories, everything has been put in Areej’s name. What will my Salman be left with? Now Salman won’t even 
have love in his share. Salman, come quickly son, 
we are getting late. Come on, son, Salman, 
your uncle Waqar is waiting downstairs. Come on. Come. Come on. We will go. 
Lovely baby will go. My love. Oh, it is hot. It is hot.
 Sun. Sun. Sun. We will sit quickly. Mama’s love. I want to go with mama. Come on. No, you will sit with me. Come on. No, I am not going. Salman. Salman. Sister-in-law, take her. No Mehreen, you sit inside. We cannot agree to
 him all the time. Sit. Sister-in-law… No. sit. Come on, sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Wasai. Wasai. Coming, madam. Take care of Salman, 
we are going. Sure. Goodbye. Goodbye.
