[21.96] What do you think, Salman?
[28.76] Is that Arooj as innocent 
in reality as she looks?
[38.48] I have an issue with a lot of things 
about Arooj, but,
[45.48] the reality is that she is that 
she is not bad character.
[48.04] You are mistaken. Okay fine,
[50.76] I can give you this concession too.
[52.60] When you had liked that Arooj, 
when you had chosen her for marriage,
[57.44] that Arooj of yours was simple, 
then, but now,
[60.08] since that boy Ammad has come 
to the office,
[64.60] since then Arooj has changed.
[73.68] And even brother Idrees noticed this.
[81.28] It is weird.
[84.68] Uncle said the same thing to me.
[87.24] Same to same.
[91.24] Okay,
[92.32] I will also admit that 
I am a mother-in-law,
[94.36] I don’t like Arooj,
[96.12] I can give a bad opinion about her, 
but is brother Idrees also lying?
[106.52] You are absolutely right.
[115.12] I will have to do something 
about this Ammad.
[118.20] This Ammad has caused cracks 
in our home.
[126.72] I know,
[128.56] you are thinking that 
Arooj won’t agree.
[133.20] There is an easy solution for this.
[139.92] You do one thing, 
end this office at home.
[148.88] This way, Ammad too will get fired
[151.68] and your Arooj will become 
the same as before.
[223.28] I don’t understand, how long this cold war
 will go on for, Salman.
[232.96] If you don’t talk,
[234.80] if you don’t answer me, then 
how will we find a solution?
[239.00] We will not find a solution to the issue 
with us talking.
[244.04] Then at least talk,
[246.20] we will find a solution for the problem
 together.
[251.04] When are you firing Ammad?
[254.68] I think we have spoken on this topic.
[257.40] Yes, but the discussion was incomplete.
[259.48] Because I had said no.
[261.64] You had said no, that is why 
it was incomplete.
[268.52] It will be complete when you fire Ammad 
from this office.
[274.72] Fine.
[277.48] You fire him yourself.
[281.04] Look,
[282.88] I am giving you respect in this company.
[289.60] You are the one who appointed Ammad,
[292.20] so now you will fire him too.
[296.80] Salman, I told you why I cannot fire him 
from the job.
[300.84] I don’t want to hear this.
[303.08] Fine, then don’t hear it.
[305.60] You signed two cheques today, right?
[308.40] You did, right?
[313.44] Do you know where this money went?
[316.04] I am the owner of this company,
[318.40] I can set fire to the money, why do you care?
[321.20] Because I cannot see you facing loss.
[326.12] I am your wife.
[327.72] Look, sit on one seat at a time,
[331.84] either become my wife, or become 
the director of finance.
[338.64] And if you want that you continue 
to be the director finance,
[341.48] and this office at home continues,
[344.04] then fire Ammad.
[350.84] And that is my final decision.
[369.68] Go ahead, Shanzay.
[371.20] Arooj, tell me, did brother Salman’s 
misunderstanding got removed or not?
[376.32] What?
[378.36] Are you kidding me?
[380.60] Is this time to ask me this question?
[384.64] Arooj, I saw you in my dream.
[388.00] You were walking straight and 
fell in the mud,
[391.60] and a lot of toads were there 
in that mud.
[395.96] Please,
[397.44] stop joking.
[399.32] I am already really worried right now.
[401.60] Joke? Fine,
[404.16] that thing about the toads was too much,
[406.88] but you find my dreams to be 
a joke too, right?
[415.48] Dreams are jokes.
[423.28] They look like the truth,
[428.04] and a lie in their reality.
[430.76] Are you serious?
[437.08] Salman has put the condition 
of firing Ammad.
[445.64] and if you don’t do that, then?
[449.88] Or else Salman will shut down the office.
[460.52] But he doesn’t know 
what I am going to do.
[467.88] If I quit the office at this moment,
[472.88] then I will never be able to unmask 
that man,
[478.32] who is harming Salman.
[481.88] Really?
[483.08] If this is true, then who is that man?
[492.92] Uncle.
[519.64] A wall of doubt has come 
between Salman and I.
[526.04] He thinks that I get frank with Ammad.
[531.84] If a misunderstanding remains for long,
[535.04] then it becomes a sorrow.
[537.32] Then maybe this sorrow 
cannot be removed.
[543.16] Arooj will not fire Ammad 
from the company,
[548.84] that is why Ammad should leave the job
[551.44] and save Arooj’s scattering home.
[556.48] But Ammad’s mother’s illness,
[559.60] Ammad’s job and
[563.48] his mother’s treatment will be 
taken care of,
[571.04] but if Arooj and Salman have a line 
of difference between them,
[577.72] then it will become difficult 
to cross it.
[605.96] Hello.
[607.32] Madam, how did you think of me 
early in the morning?
[610.96] Man, I couldn’t sleep all night.
[613.48] In whose memory were you awake?
Am I that lucky person.
[617.64] Don’t talk nonsense.
[619.32] I have called to talk to you 
about something serious.
[621.84] Oh please, don’t say that
[623.68] you are in love with me. Huh?
[627.84] You are mistaken.
[629.24] Okay. Okay. I was joking.
[631.84] Tell me, why did you call me?
[636.16] Your presence is creating a lot of 
difficulties in Arooj’s life.
[659.80] Arooj’s life is becoming difficult 
because of me,
[663.92] and I am still present there.
[667.00] Why didn’t Arooj not tell me?
[669.72] This is not just Arooj’s 
but also my insult.
[673.60] I cannot give anyone permission
[677.48] that someone looks at me like that.
[680.48] I will not tolerate this.
[692.32] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[694.12] Is Mr. Salman there?
[696.48] Yes, Mr. Salman is there. 
Fine, tell him, Ammad has come.
[699.48] Okay.
[707.00] Thank you. 
Thanks.
[714.36] Hello. 
Sir, Mir. Ammad has come.
[718.84] Send him in.
[728.72] Mr. Ammad, you can go. 
Mr. Salman is waiting for you.
[731.68] Yes, thank you.
[733.16] You are welcome.
[735.72] Greetings sir. 
Greetings.
[737.72] How are you, sir?
Are you fine?
[739.12] I am good.
[740.40] Sir, you know I have kept the money plant
 you gave me safe till now.
[745.28] Good, water it like this.
[747.80] It will become a tree one day.
[751.68] Excuse me.
[760.88] Hello sir.
[764.48] Sit.
[765.88] No, sir.
[767.24] I didn’t come here to sit.
[770.92] What do you want?
[773.12] Nicotine is injurious for health.
[786.52] I know what is right and 
wrong for me, well.
[795.92] So,
[798.52] stay in your limits.
[804.40] By the way,
[807.28] this is my resignation letter.
[810.08] I am resigning from the job.
[819.68] Thank you.
[874.76] Hello, Ammad.
[877.08] Hello Shanzay.
[880.88] Shanzay, I have resigned.
[886.04] What will happen now?
[890.44] Shanzay,
[892.20] I have come out of this quicksand 
of misunderstanding.
[896.08] Now I don’t know what will happen.
[900.12] Ammad, you have put yourself in difficulty,
by sacrificing your job for a better objective.
[906.68] I would still ask you how will you 
manage this all?
[909.88] Shanzay, the most beautiful things 
about difficult days is that they pass.
[916.24] But Ammad, mama’s ailment.
[918.84] God gave this ailment, 
so He will help.
[923.96] Ammad, you know
[926.08] you are a really brave man,
[929.72] and you will see that God will 
help you like this in future.
[935.24] Okay Shanzay, 
I will put down the phone.
[938.96] Okay. Fine, take care of yourself.
[941.72] Okay, bye.
[984.88] Smile Arooj.
[988.44] Ammad is asking you with 
so much affection,
[992.36] so you should smile.
[995.48] Boss, you…
[997.64] I shouldn’t have come?
[1002.72] Did I disturb you people?
[1009.00] No matter how dashing the boss is,
[1016.60] you are never happy to meet them.
[1083.64] Fatima.
[1085.76] Good morning madam. 
Good morning.
[1087.84] Where is Ammad?
[1089.08] Madam, sir Ammad didn’t come today.
[1091.68] Okay.
[1095.32] He didn’t come to the office?
[1110.92] Hello.
[1112.40] Hello.
[1114.84] Ammad, where are you?
[1117.40] On the way.
[1119.00] Okay fine, come to the office.
[1120.96] No, I..
[1124.00] I am on my way home.
[1127.72] What do you mean? 
You are not coming to the office?
[1135.80] Hello?
[1136.96] Yes.
[1138.36] Yes, I…no,
[1141.20] I am not coming.
[1143.56] Actually, I have resigned.
[1150.56] What?
[1154.64] You resigned?
[1159.60] Yes.
[1161.40] But why?
[1164.48] We had to do so much work together.
[1170.44] I am sorry, Arooj.
[1175.60] Actually, you know the thing is
[1179.68] that mama stays really unwell.
[1182.92] I am unable to take care of her,
[1185.64] so I will have to take this step 
to take care of her.
[1194.40] And, after all,
[1197.48] I want to focus on her treatment.
[1200.72] But how will you pay for the expenses
of aunt’s treatment?
[1207.96] God is great.
[1215.40] I will manage something.
[1223.04] What can I say?
[1224.96] I can only pray for your mother.
[1231.88] Can I say something?
[1235.52] You left me alone.
[1244.00] I was going to stand up against these 
conspiring people on your basis.
[1253.32] But anyway, no issue.
[1258.84] Your reason is also valid in itself.
[1263.36] Take care of yourself,
[1266.16] goodbye.
[1267.92] Goodbye.
[1324.12] Boss, congratulations. 
Have sweet.
[1328.48] You know, I have diabetes, 
I don’t have sweets.
[1331.76] Boss, eat it. You eat so much, 
nothing happens,
[1334.36] what will a bite of cake do?
[1337.16] By the way, what is this for?
[1339.72] Our wish got fulfilled.
[1343.64] I am coming from the HR Department.
[1345.60] Ammad resigned from 
the job and went.
[1350.12] Really? That is great.
[1353.12] But I don’t understand one thing, sir,
[1355.00] why did Ammad resign 
and leave himself?
[1359.44] If he hadn’t resigned, 
he would have been fired.
[1362.76] You believe me now.
[1364.00] I made it so suffocating that he found
it reasonable to run from here to breath.
[1369.36] You know, boss, you are really smart.
[1375.08] Tell me something,
[1376.28] will madam Arooj stop her investigations 
after Ammad’s departure.
[1381.20] She should stop it.
[1383.48] The ruler doesn’t work themselves, 
the ones under them work.
[1387.04] They neither have ears nor eyes.
[1390.12] In fact, even the hands of 
his subordinate are used.
[1393.60] You are right about that sir.
[1395.92] Now we will do our deals openly.
[1399.76] Exactly.
[1404.52] Take this cake.
[1496.08] May I come in, sir.
[1497.76] Come in.
[1501.72] Yes, sir, you called me?
[1503.84] You do one thing,
[1505.48] send an assistant to the finance 
office at home,
[1508.76] madam Arooj has a need.
[1511.88] Fine sir, we will send someone 
from the office.
[1516.04] Perfect. So you do one thing, 
send Shahzad.
[1520.28] Right, sir. I will send Shahzad today.
[1523.24] One more thing,
[1524.72] put up a post on social media 
that we need an assistant.
[1528.72] Right sir.
[1529.80] Thank you. 
Thank you.
[1554.40] What is all this that happened?
[1558.96] We were about to reveal 
the cheating of uncle
[1563.76] and Ammad left.
[1566.28] You didn’t do the right thing, Ammad.
[1570.44] And on one hand, 
Salman was insistent on firing him,
[1577.00] and see,
[1579.16] we didn’t have to fire him.
[1581.92] There is surely some complication.
[1589.60] Little madam,
[1591.88] your phone was kept there and 
it was ringing again and again.
[1599.12] Hey, I am getting a call from 
Salman’s office,
[1602.64] I will get a call back.
[1605.12] What is the matter, little madam?
[1607.88] You look worried.
[1613.44] Don’t you get tired of asking the same
question again and again.
[1617.04] You are right,
[1619.40] I repeatedly ask you 
why you are worried.
[1625.72] and you know the answer.
[1628.56] Wasai knows everything.
[1633.64] I just keep on asking
[1636.52] so that the burden on your heart
can be reduced.
[1648.08] Hello.
[1653.32] Yes?
[1656.84] No, I think I don’t need him.
I will tell Salman.
[1662.32] Alright. Thank you.
[1683.52] Hello.
[1684.92] Salman, your receptionist called.
[1687.56] She said you are sending 
some assistant?
[1691.08] Yes, I have sent him.
[1693.32] It will help you.
[1694.88] Till the time new assistant is appointed,
[1697.48] he will support you.
[1700.08] No, thank you so much, 
I don’t want an assistant.
[1704.72] Why don’t you want one?
[1706.44] You have so much load on you, 
how will you manage?
[1709.20] It is okay, the load is not that much,
I will manage.
[1712.88] Even if you don’t have load, still.
[1714.68] I am sending Shahzad, 
he is an experienced man.
[1718.24] No, I don’t want to hire 
a male assistant,
[1721.80] so don’t send anyone.
[1724.60] What is this? Why don’t you want one?
[1727.16] Nothing had happened till now.
[1729.56] But if something happens again
[1732.24] and after that I will have to give you
a justification of my character,
[1736.08] and I don’t want that at all.
[1744.28] Why?
[1746.60] Did I say something wrong?
[1750.88] No.
[1753.24] But it is possible that he is not 
an old class fellow.
[1760.36] Maybe he would be a person 
you would stay reserved with.
[1764.56] You can say, you can think 
what you want,
[1769.28] but don’t send anyone.
[1771.28] If you send someone,
I will fire them.
[1777.60] Goodbye.
[1781.32] Arooj…
[1828.44] What all do girls check at the time 
of the wedding,
[1833.32] but they don’t know
[1836.68] that a mother-in-law can be like Mehreen.
[1841.32] This Arooj is so innocent.
[1845.84] There is so much difficulty,
[1848.84] but she doesn’t tell her parents.
[1852.68] She is really patient.
[1856.32] I am scared,
[1859.40] that this oppressed girl might curse us,
[1863.48] and even if she doesn’t curse us,
[1866.36] still you get cursed for oppressing.
[1871.84] Madam, your tea.
[1880.16] Madam,
[1882.20] what are you thinking?
[1891.76] I am thinking about Arooj.
[1898.28] That child’s life has so many issues.
[1903.56] Madam,
[1905.80] the issues you are thinking about,
[1908.96] one of those issues has been sorted.
[1915.12] Meaning?
Meaning,
[1917.80] that boy, who little master used to hate…
[1922.76] that, Mr. Ammad,
[1925.68] he resigned from the job himself and left.
[1932.24] How do you know this?
[1934.40] I just heard it with my own ears and came.
[1940.20] Fine, you leave.
[1942.48] Sure.
[1947.68] Okay,
[1950.60] this turned out to be better for Arooj.
[1972.72] I think we have prepared everything 
for the presentation tomorrow
[1976.40] and if we get this project,
[1978.52] all our bonuses will be due.
[1983.44] So, I am looking forward.
[1984.80] Amna will assist you in the remaining 
details, and…
[1988.36] you see, I will come.
[1989.92] You?
[1990.76] Yes. 
Come.
[1995.32] Arooj, didn’t your accountant 
Ammad come today?
[2001.96] He resigned from the job.
[2006.52] He resigned.
[2009.36] This is really bad.
[2011.12] He really needs money right now.
[2014.12] That poor thing doesn’t have money 
to buy medicines.
[2018.68] How do you know?
[2020.68] I met him at the medical store.
[2024.16] That poor thing didn’t have enough 
money to buy all the medication.
[2031.12] If someone is affected by 
Mehreen’s hatred,
[2034.36] then this happens to them.
[2037.36] Then even if they are our own 
or a stranger.
[2042.76] I am really disappointed to hear this.
[2093.52] What are you doing here?
[2096.24] Are you looking for something?
[2098.68] I just came sister-in-law.
[2102.16] You will not find who you are looking for.
[2107.12] What do you mean, sister-in-law?
[2109.24] The poison you put in Salman’s mind
because of Arooj, for a needy person,
[2114.80] after that the boy left himself.
[2119.56] Did he quit the job and go?
[2121.36] Obviously,
[2123.68] you had left him no option.
[2127.36] A respectable person wants 
to save their respect,
[2131.36] and for that it doesn’t matter 
how much loss they have to face.
[2137.60] Why are you taking his side so much, 
sister-in-law?
[2140.44] No, no, the time for taking 
sides has passed.
[2144.56] Now only reward and punishment 
will be announced.
[2149.20] Why are you telling me all this?
[2151.72] What have I done?
[2153.56] I just told Salman what 
brother Idrees told me.
[2161.64] I will talk to Idrees,
[2164.32] but you accept it that you didn’t 
do good with that boy.
[2171.92] He is needy.
[2173.56] He needed this job.
[2208.60] I am amazed by you, Arooj.
[2211.48] You turned out to be so cunning 
at such a young age.
[2221.16] You didn’t like what I said?
[2229.00] You shouldn’t like it either, 
even I want that.
[2236.68] Aunty, I am working.
[2238.84] It must be really difficult to work alone.
[2242.16] Now that boy is not there either…
[2248.04] what is his name? He has a smart name.
[2252.80] Ammad.
