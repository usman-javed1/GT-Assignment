[158.52] Are you fine?
[161.80] I am fine, child.
[163.56] Don’t worry.
[168.80] I will talk to them.
[173.00] Madam, what are you doing here?
[176.44] Why did you bring him here?
[178.44] He is my father.
[180.32] Madam, this is the police station.
[181.76] We only bring the ones 
who are criminals here.
[184.56] Really?
[185.92] What has he done? 
What is his crime?
[189.12] You ask this from the inspector.
[204.44] Papa, I will do something.
 Don’t worry.
[208.44] Okay, child.
[318.84] A decent man like master, 
and the police?
[332.12] The whole neighbourhood knows
[333.88] that he never even 
mistreated an animal.
[341.24] Why are you thinking 
this sister Naseema?
[350.92] We all know,
[353.00] the entire neighbourhood knows that
 the police took master without any fault.
[367.52] Salman and Idrees are getting 
all this done,
[375.88] to show their power.
[386.00] They want to scare us, 
so that we become weak.
[391.40] Sister Mehreen,
[392.68] so why are they doing 
this with us?
[401.24] We stay at home,
[406.44] then why are they doing this
injustice with us.
[415.16] They are here.
[422.48] Thank God you people have come.
[480.04] Arooj,
[488.32] are Salman and Idrees getting 
all this done?
[501.56] Yes.
[523.76] Those people say that
[526.00] papa has kept Areej 
against her will.
[546.60] Why are those people doing this?
[559.76] Because we deserve this,
 that’s why.
[568.64] What are you saying?
[572.28] I am right, mama.
[580.84] If the beast within a person is
 unleashed,
[583.84] people like us, who are timid, 
cannot confront it.
[615.52] If we sit scared and timid like this, 
frightened like a criminal,
[619.44] these people won’t let us live.
[632.60] Child, we are decent people.
[638.40] Decency is our asset.
[641.08] That is the issue with us decent 
and respectable people, papa.
[668.48] If a modest person steps back 
from a person,
[672.20] then the immodest person feels
 they are cowards.
[691.24] And do you know?
[693.04] Not raising your voice for your rights
is also a great ingratitude to God.
[736.64] I have decided,
[739.16] I will stand up for my right.
[758.80] And now, I will not listen 
to anyone of you.
[782.04] Arooj.
[823.32] What is the matter?
[825.00] How did you people come inside?
[828.36] This is a home of decent people,
 inspector.
[830.84] At least you people should seek 
permission before coming.
[834.48] We know well how decent 
you people are.
[844.32] Come with us to the police station.
[845.84] But why? What have I done?
[847.48] What is my fault?
[848.64] You will find out your fault 
when you go to the police station.
[851.08] Where are you taking him? 
Leave him.
[852.32] Show me the warrant, first. 
Leave him.
[853.96] What are you doing?
What are you doing?
[855.60] You are taking him for no reason.
 Why?
[858.80] Sister Mehreen.
[863.04] Sister Naseema, you first go 
call Arooj.
[865.56] But…
[866.32] You go and call Arooj. 
I will see. You go ahead.
[943.80] You are really comfortable, right?
[946.48] I don’t like it at all.
[949.76] You will find the marks of the slap 
you hit me on my face on your existence.
[960.28] She is my daughter.
[962.00] Salman what are you doing?
I said leave her.
[963.68] I will not let you bring her up. 
Leave her, I say. Leave her…
[967.16] She is my daughter
[968.92] and I will not let you bring her up.
[971.72] Salman, don’t do that.
[974.48] We will sit and talk. 
Come on.
[978.48] The time to sit and 
talk has passed.
[981.24] Leave her, I cannot live without her.
[982.92] Why can you not live without her?
[985.12] Did you not live without your mother?
[988.96] This is my daughter, 
she will live with me.
[990.84] You cannot do this. 
Salman, stop. Salman.
[1016.00] Is all okay?
[1018.04] Why are you walking like that?
[1019.56] I am fine. I am fine.
[1024.48] Where did you go?
[1028.20] I went to meet Salman.
[1037.76] To meet Salman?
[1040.00] Why?
[1043.32] To talk on your issue.
[1055.12] I told him to save his home 
from getting ruined.
[1064.84] Then? What did he say, then?
[1068.56] He cursed me
[1077.88] and made me fall 
by pushing me down.
[1102.84] You cannot take Areej.
[1104.28] You cannot keep a mother 
away from her daughter.
[1106.36] I will stop you. 
Leave me.
[1108.00] Leave my hand. 
I won’t leave it.
[1109.48] Leave my hand…
[1113.72] Arooj
[1118.04] how dare you raise your hand 
at my son?
[1122.64] A mother raised her hand 
for her daughter.
[1127.36] But when will you understand this?
[1130.60] If you take Areej from here, 
then I will kill you.
[1149.96] No, no, Salman don’t do this.
[1151.76] Stop them, Salman. 
Hey, where are you taking it?
[1153.96] Salman. Stop them, Salman.
[1156.24] Where are they taking my bike?
[1157.96] Salman. Salman, 
don’t do this. Look…
[1175.00] What happened?
[1177.00] Why did you stop?
[1178.84] Hit me.
[1181.32] I would have surely slapped you,
[1183.04] if the mark of the slap from last night 
not left your face.
[1192.56] Why did you come here? 
And I knew you would do this.
[1200.76] That’s why I followed you 
and came here.
[1203.84] Who asked you to come here?
[1206.88] Child, I wanted to talk to Salman.
[1231.20] Papa.
[1240.52] Papa.
[1262.12] Look, you are decent people.
[1265.60] I think that you let this matter go.
[1271.36] All this is not something 
you people can deal with
[1276.32] and you know this really well 
who did all this.
[1283.36] If you still want to hear it from me,
 then hear it.
[1289.96] This has been done by 
Mr. Idrees and his nephew,
[1292.48] in fact, he turned out to be his son.
[1295.84] Anyway, they did all this.
[1302.84] Look madam, they are 
really powerful people
[1308.28] and my advice to you is that
[1310.84] you don’t mess with them.
[1315.92] Look, whatever the matter is, 
end it
[1322.48] or they will ruin your life.
[1424.40] This is not that easy.
[1426.68] It costs a lot of money. 
It takes a lot of time.
[1429.88] Neither do we have money,
[1432.04] nor does Arooj have time.
[1436.04] You are right Master.
[1443.56] Arooj also comes really late
from her job.
[1449.36] Now you tell me,
[1451.12] are we capable of filing a case?
[1454.08] We are not, papa.
[1456.64] We surely, are not.
[1462.76] But, are we so weak
[1465.36] that we cannot even protest?
[1478.52] You have taught me papa.
[1484.72] If accepting injustice becomes fate,
[1488.24] even then, it is necessary to protest.
[1501.68] Is this what you taught me 
through your upbringing?
[1504.20] Weren’t these the brave things 
you used to say to me?
[1508.40] Then have faith in your daughter.
[1655.44] Sister in law, Salman is a really 
old friend of mine.
[1659.92] In fact, you can say
[1662.68] he was an old friend.
[1671.92] But I couldn’t even imagine Salman
would have such thinking.
[1683.08] Brother Nasir,
[1685.12] if Salman has enmity with me,
[1687.56] he should attack me.
[1693.84] Why is he humiliating my family?
[1718.12] Till today, I had decided, I would 
stay quiet, I won’t say anything.
[1728.52] But now I have decided,
[1732.08] I will not stay quiet at all.
[1736.24] Sister in law, I am not even 1% surprised
 at anything that you are saying.
[1749.00] You are thinking correctly.
[1760.48] Sister in law, I would just want to say,
[1763.44] if you need anything
[1769.68] or anything is worrying you,
[1772.16] then your brother is standing with you.
[1777.12] Thank you so much brother Nasir.
[1785.52] You gave me a post in the company,
[1787.92] you helped me so much, I…
Sister in law, please,
[1791.28] you deserved this job.
[1802.96] I didn’t do any favours on you.
[1809.24] I have found out from 
the management that
[1812.56] Salman has ended all his tenders.
[1825.56] Is this true?
[1828.28] Yes.
[1835.32] Unfortunately, that’s how 
it is sister in law.
[1847.12] and all this is happening 
because of me.
[1856.16] Brother Nasir, you know
[1859.44] 70% tenders of this company 
are Salman’s
[1871.88] and if these tenders end,
then the company will end.
[1886.04] Why are making a deal in loss 
because of me?
[1889.08] Sister in law, what you see as loss,
[1893.12] it is actually not loss
[1904.04] and believe me, 
I am satisfied in my heart
[1906.28] that at least I didn’t snatch 
anyone’s right.
[1919.56] And sister in law, 
tenders come and go.
[1922.08] You don’t worry at all.
