[43.08] What are you thinking?
[46.28] I am thinking Master that
[51.24] Arooj has taken all of
her signs along with her.
[56.56] You said it yourself,
[58.12] she wanted to show
them to someone
[59.52] so she can find her parents
[63.52] Maybe that’s why.
[68.04] But she never told
us what happened.
[73.48] If something happened only
then she will tell us.
[79.72] I hope
[82.64] she hasn’t started to think
of us as strangers.
[87.52] You mothers are really obsessed
with negative thoughts.
[94.72] Sir I have seen her
behavior changed.
[104.88] Okay please stop worrying yourself.
[108.52] You started to look sick.
[152.00] Where is mom she is
not picking up her phone.
[155.60] I call papa.
[172.36] Arooj calling,
[176.56] Yes child.
[177.72] Greetings father.
[179.32] Greetings.
[181.40] were us mom?
[183.68] She is sitting right here with me.
[187.36] Please give her the phone.
[188.56] yeah sure
[190.44] here you go,
[191.84] please turn on the speaker.
[195.48] Yes child
[197.40] Greetings mom.
[198.80] Greetings,
[201.44] may you always stay
happy and blessed.
[207.28] Your father and I were
just remembering you.
[212.32] I was remembering you
[214.64] but your mom
[216.12] was sitting here worrying
not eating breakfast.
[219.64] What's father saying Mom?
[221.68] Your father is just messing with you.
[238.28] Arooj?
[245.20] Why have you become so quiet?
[248.60] go ahead.
[250.48] Yes
[255.12] I have to talk to you about
something really important.
[263.48] Yes child go ahead.
[270.52] Mother my old bracelet
and old clothes,
[277.80] just right now wasai
have just shown me...
[279.68] .... a picture of a child
wearing the exact same thing.
[293.68] Those clothes
[295.04] and the bracelet looked
exactly the same mother.
[315.72] Why are you so quiet?
[317.92] Arooj child please talk.
[324.24] Mother.
[325.52] Yes my child.
[330.12] that child in that picture is me.
[348.76] And
[355.28] Mehreen Aunty is my mother.
[372.12] And Wasai has confirmed all this.
[376.44] So my child,
[377.84] did you tell your mother in law?
[379.36] I mean your Mother?
[385.52] No dad,
[392.40] her mental is not that
[395.28] well that she can bear any shock
[398.32] and then
[400.20] this will be a huge thing for her.
[404.64] So what will you do now, my child?
[413.00] I will wait for the right time, mom.
[434.48] Okay, my child,
[436.52] whatever you feel is right.
[443.32] Mom, I will talk to later,
[446.60] bye.
[448.24] Bye.
[458.44] Salman is your present
[462.32] that you have in your control
[465.72] but I am here to know
[469.12] which family do you belong to.
[476.16] Do you even have any family or not?
[483.24] After all, whose daughter are you?
[488.20] Mom?
[497.92] Hey,
[499.12] back off,
[500.96] why are you stuck to me? Move back.
[503.36] Mom.
[504.36] What Mom Mom?
[505.48] No mom.
[506.16] Hey move back,
[508.20] why have you glued yourself to me?
[509.80] I am asking you to move back,
[511.44] back off,
[513.72] are you mad?
[515.68] Why are you repeatedly
calling me your mom?
[517.84] I am not your mother.
[519.72] You fool!
[524.76] Madam Jr,
[526.96] I understand your emotion
[530.32] but you getting emotional like this
[534.00] is not the solution to this problem.
[536.24] If a daughter is calling
her mother, a mother,
[539.24] then what is wrong in it?
[541.28] Doctors have always warned us,
[544.24] that any huge shock
[546.32] or accident
[547.96] can make her completely mad,
[554.40] or she could even die.
[557.96] God Forbid,
[560.08] I don’t want to lose
my mom once again.
[566.16] Then have some patience
Madam Jr,
[573.00] you can tell everyone
the truth at the right time.
[668.88] This world is so small, Naseema Begum,
[673.12] you find people if they are alive.
[683.96] It is so unfortunate, Master,
[688.80] Arooj cannot tell Mehreen
[692.96] that she is her daughter,
[696.60] she will go through double hell that way.
[706.96] Arooj wants motherly
love from Mehreen
[717.96] and in return,
[722.52] she will give her the
cruelty of a mother in law.
[746.32] Will you not call me mom now?
[750.08] I cannot even think that,
[752.88] you are my mom and
you are my dad.
[756.64] Yes we are your parents.
[764.76] So then what are you sad for?
[802.04] Wasai?
[803.64] Yes, Madam?
[805.68] Wasai, where is Arooj?
[808.40] I haven’t seen her for so long.
[810.16] Madam,
[811.40] Madam Jr is in her room.
[821.04] Okay, make soup for Arooj.
[823.64] Okay Madam.
[826.84] I don’t know what is
wrong with this girl?
[829.24] What is she thinking?
[831.60] My doll is here,
[833.12] hmm?
[833.96] My child,
[834.88] why don’t you take care of yourself?
[837.80] You have to take extra care
of yourself in these days.
[841.36] Yes, Aunt.
[846.80] And yes,
[847.92] stay away from Mehreen,
[850.68] taking tension these days
is not good for the baby.
[856.44] Come on, make soup for her.
[865.16] Wasai,
[867.96] why does she hate
aunt Mehreen so much?
[872.76] Madam Jr,
[875.00] you have now started
to defend Madam Sr,
[879.08] she has hated her
since the beginning.
[894.16] What is it?
[895.56] Is everything okay,
[897.08] you never thought this earlier?
[905.88] I guess I didn’t even know it earlier,
Wasai,
[913.52] but now I think
[914.64] Aunt Mehreen is absolutely right
[917.60] and everyone else is wrong.
[919.68] Everyone else is actually wrong.
[926.28] What do you mean?
[928.52] No, nothing,
[930.20] I just randomly said it.
[931.84] I will make soup for you.
[936.60] Yes, You go make soup,
[938.48] I will go check on Aunt meanwhile.
[940.04] Okay Madam Jr.
[955.36] Go, go Madam Jr,
[965.72] that’s how mother’s love is.
[983.96] How madam was showering
so much love on Madam Jr,
[997.48] though she is the actual enemy.
[1370.40] You?
[1376.44] What are you doing in my
room at this time?
[1380.08] Arooj, wait, listen to me.
[1383.60] What is she doing here?
[1385.36] She even has the audacity
to come in my room,
[1388.96] I will go see her.
[1391.64] Arooj?
[1393.28] Arooj?
[1436.08] Stop.
[1444.36] What were you doing in
my room right now?
[1464.40] I was just randomly…
[1466.56] Randomly what?
[1469.64] I thought that…
[1471.24] What did you think?
[1472.52] That Mehreen must be
sleeping right now
[1473.96] and you can strangle
her to death right now,
[1475.56] that is what you thought, right?
[1476.84] No,
[1478.16] I cannot even imagine this.
[1479.80] Oh please, let it be, girl,
[1481.04] fool someone else.
[1484.44] It’s not that.
[1485.64] That’s how it is,
[1486.80] else, you never came to my
room like this ever before.
[1490.52] I used to come to your room.
[1492.20] Yes, you used to,
[1493.56] only when I would call you.
[1495.20] Else, you never came so silently.
[1503.32] What happened now, Mehreen?
[1514.44] Why are you always shouting
at the poor girl?
[1520.88] After all, what is her fault?
[1523.00] What has she done to you?
[1535.04] Look at her condition,
[1537.52] don’t you know her condition?
[1552.04] Aunt, it’s not her fault,
[1566.44] it was my fault
[1568.60] I shouldn’t have done that.
[1655.28] Now you tell me, Salman?
[1657.88] Has Arooj done the right thing?
[1661.12] Mom, you should be happy
[1663.08] she considers you her mother,
[1665.88] every mother-in-law dreams of
having such a daughter-in-law.
[1669.32] I don’t see such nightmares,
[1671.28] that anyone can just come
up and call me Mom.
[1675.04] I am just your mother
[1677.32] and I have no relationship with
anyone in this world except you,
[1680.32] it’s just Salman and his mother.
[1683.08] Okay, don’t tense yourself,
[1686.00] there is nothing like that.
[1687.72] That is how it is Salman.
[1690.88] okay fine,
[1692.56] I will talk to her, you relax.
[1694.68] Yes, please,
[1695.52] go and make her understand.
[1698.16] Okay I will.
[1753.28] Don’t say anything
[1755.92] because there is no use
in saying anything,
[1759.96] I am a mother in law for you,
[1764.24] like you consider me your mother,
[1768.80] you are a very happy-go-lucky,
lovely girl
[1775.96] but I have been noticing for a few days
[1780.40] that you have become very dull,
[1784.16] I can feel your pain,
[1788.20] take care of yourself
[1791.36] and listen,
[1794.04] stay happy.
[1921.48] Madam Jr, may I come in?
[1925.64] Come in, Wasai.
[1947.36] What is it?
[1950.24] Why are you looking at me like this?
[1954.88] I am thinking
[1958.48] that you are in such complication.
[1973.84] Madam Sr scolded you so much
[1978.08] and you couldn’t say anything.
[1983.68] You are right,
[1991.52] this feeling is like that.
[1996.52] Do you know,
[2003.52] since I have found out that
[2007.36] Aunt Mehreen is my mother,
[2012.36] even if she scolds me,
[2015.08] I don’t feel bad for anything,
[2019.04] in fact, I feel like,
[2022.24] like she is talking to me.
[2028.48] But the sad part is, Madam Jr,
[2043.08] this can’t be told to her.
[2048.76] Hmm,
[2052.36] you are right.
[2062.28] Mehreen never cares
about Arooj at all,
[2066.60] she never has mercy on her,
[2068.04] we have to keep this
secret as a secret.
[2079.20] Nature has brought
me so much closer, Wasai,
[2088.96] look,
[2092.08] me getting married into this house,
[2100.52] and looking at that
picture in your room,
[2106.24] it changed my life.
[2117.60] You are right.
[2120.84] Hey, Wasai,
[2122.36] we had to go to the doctor,
[2124.56] look, I forgot.
[2127.16] Okay then, come.
[2129.88] Wait, I will go get my bag.
[2141.92] Picture?
[2192.00] May God have mercy
on you, Madam Jr.
[2203.60] Wasai can only pray for you.
[2228.44] Nature has brought me
so much closer, Wasai,
[2236.20] look,
[2239.40] me getting married i
nto this house,
[2243.20] and looking at that picture
in your room,
[2248.88] it changed my life.
[2251.76] You are right.
[2271.00] What did I just hear?
[2274.80] What is going on in this house?
[2284.12] What secret is Arooj hiding?
[2291.08] What picture were both
of them talking about?
