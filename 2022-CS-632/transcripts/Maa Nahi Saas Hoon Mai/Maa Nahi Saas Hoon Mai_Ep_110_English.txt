Arooj. What are you thinking? I am thinking that papa knows everything 
about this attack. But I don’t know why, he doesn’t want to say 
anything about this. Yes, Arooj. Master didn’t say a word about 
a single moment of this incident. and maybe he doesn’t want 
to talk about this because he feels that 
his daughter Arooj will start disliking his in-laws. Yes, Arooj. He is thinking like every 
good father. And then there is that father, uncle Idrees, who wants to ruin his son’s life 
in his greed for money. No, no, Salman don’t do this. Stop them, Salman. 
Hey, where are you taking it? Salman. 
Stop them, Salman. Where are they taking my bike? Salman. Salman, don’t do this. Look… What happened? Why did you stop? Hit me. I would have surely slapped you, if the mark of the slap from 
last night not left your face. Why did you come here? And I knew you would do this. That’s why I followed you 
and came here. Who asked you to come here? Child, I wanted to talk to Salman. Let the sunlight come, papa. Child, I want that there is 
always light in your life. Amen. How is the pain? 
Are you better? I am absolutely fine, child. Thank God. I didn’t ask you about this 
yesterday. I was scared. But then I kept on thinking 
all night long. What did my daughter think? That when the officer asked you, if you doubt someone, then you said you don’t 
doubt anyone. Yes, I am right. You should have taken 
Salman’s name. Why should I have taken 
his name? What proof do I have 
for this allegation? Proof? You should have taken his name, it was my responsibility 
to gather the proof. No, child, Arooj. I will not be disheartened till 
the last ray of hope. Do you still have some hope? Salman will come back in your life. I want to save your home. I want to see you happily married. I want to make my last attempt. Maybe I can change Salman. Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t go through the police station. I will try my best to save my home. Even after so much happened? Only for the sake of my daughter. I think the same way. You reduced the burden on 
my heart by saying this. This matter will not get resolved the way you are thinking about it. Yes, I have an idea, but that fear doesn’t leave my heart. If we feel scared and sit quietly, then we won’t be able to do 
anything for Arooj. If Arooj gets everything and 
loses her relation with Salman, then it will be a deal made in loss. This relation is between those two. It cannot be saved with 
one person sacrificing. Master, Salman has forgotten that he also has a Arooj in his life. So, sir got free. You finally found time 
to come to me? Hey, I just came, no salutations, no greetings,
you are talking to me in this tone. To get greeted, you have to do things to be 
greeted, Idrees and you…
Hey, Mussarat, earlier you were not 
this ill-mannered. Because I didn’t know of your
 hypocrisy earlier. You lied to me so much, Idrees, that I have started to hate myself 
on the decision to marry you. Hey, Mussarat, you are my wife. Second. The second wife is also a wife, 
Mussarat. Yes, absolutely. The first wife is staying with 
luxuries in a big home, and me and my son are left 
locked up in this small home. Why are you in such a bad mood? 
What is the reason? My fate is bad. Hey, everything will be fine. That’s it, Idrees. That’s it. I don’t want to hear 
another lie from you. I am tired of hearing your lies. I am surprised. You had shown me 
so many dreams. You have lied to me 
so much, Idrees. The first lie is the lie of telling the world about 
our secret marriage. The second lie is that of leaving
your wife Shaista and your son and taking me 
to that mansion. And the third lie, the dreams of all of Arooj’s property. What all had I thought of Idrees. It is all a lie. 
You are a really big cheat. Hey, stop your nonsense. 
You are speaking without thinking. Enough, Idrees, I don’t want to talk to you about 
anything. Go from here. I…
Get out. When you don’t find anyone, 
you come to me. Leave from here.
Leave. Fine. Did you not have shame keeping
a relation with a married man? Not relation, marriage. You are lying. You have put a crack 
in my home. I didn’t know. Idrees told me he has 
divorced his wife, he is alone. and you believe him? If a man cries and asks 
a woman for sympathy, then the woman becomes helpless. I thought there is a man troubled 
by circumstances, a worn-out person, 
who needs support. What? He is still left to be worn-out. Nothing happened to Master Shoaib. He has even gone home. Master Shoaib, 
wasn’t even our target. What are you saying? 
Huh? Master Shoaib is Arooj’s 
biggest strength. She does everything with his advice. This entire family has become
 a problem for us. If we would have gotten rid 
of Master Shoaib, Arooj would have become weak. Master will get scared now. How will he get scared? Shaista is right, we will have to think ten times before
making any plan, anything can happen. You know, 
you people surprise me. I mean, you people made such a 
big plan to just scare master Shoaib. This is the limit. Don’t worry, it won’t happen this time. 
Yes. Do you still think you will 
take care of this matter? You won’t be able to do anything, and that Arooj will dance 
on our heads. How is this possible? 
She has good fate; Arooj won’t get saved every time. Will someone tell me, what is going on? What are you two doing? Tell me as well, I too should find out. You too hear it out, and show us the amazing feat 
you can achieve. What tone are you talking to me in? Mom, dad’s plan failed. Arooj survived. I don’t know when this Arooj 
will have her downfall. Where did mama go? Even her handbag is not here, then where did she go? She doesn’t even know anyone 
in this area. Arooj. What are you thinking? I am thinking that papa knows everything 
about this attack. But I don’t know why, he doesn’t want to say 
anything about it. Yes, Arooj. Master didn’t say a word about 
a single moment of this incident. and maybe he doesn’t want 
to talk about this because he feels that his daughter 
Arooj will start disliking his in-laws. Yes, Arooj. He is thinking like every good father. Did she… Mama. Mama. Where is mama? Sister Mehreen must be 
in the room. I checked inside, 
she is not there. She is not there? I had knocked on her door 
for breakfast as well, but she didn’t come out. I thought she must be sleeping. Really? I will go check in the room. Arooj, if you feel that I made the wrong decision 
to leave home, then we will go back home. No, I am standing with you 
in your decision. Now, we will see whatever happens. Where can sister Mehreen go? I should have understood it then, that she is going somewhere. When? When she came to get 
a veil from me. I didn’t even ask her out
of formality, as to why she needs the veil. Hey, so you should have asked. 
She is emotional. She can make any emotional decision. What emotional decision? Nothing. Did she go back home, child? How can sister Mehreen make 
such a decision after so many fights. She can do anything 
in Salman’s love. She won’t see profit or loss. What will happen now? If those people, 
mistreat sister Mehreen, then? I think I should go there myself. No. Why? It is possible, she is not there. Yes, but she is not answering 
my phone either. You continue to call and if you don’t get to talk to her, then both of us will go together 
and see, but I will not let you go 
between those animals. Yes, go ahead, Arooj. Hello, mama. Where are you? I have been trying to contact you
 for so long. You are not even home. 
Where did you go? Arooj, I came for some work. but at least tell me 
where you are. Child, I am telling you, I have left for some work, 
I will come back. Why are you not telling me 
where you are right now. I am so worried, I have been calling you continuously,
you are not answering it. Arooj, why do you get after me? I am telling you, I am fine. I was in a rickshaw, so I didn’t 
hear your phone ring. Arooj, child, I will come home 
and talk to you. Bye. Bye. Hello, mama I… hello? What happened, Arooj, child? Arooj, what happened? 
Where is she? Is everything okay? Why are you walking like this?
I am fine. I am fine. Where did you go? I went to meet Salman. To meet Salman? Why? To talk about your issue. I told him to save his home 
from being ruined. Then? Then what did he say? He cursed me. And he pushed me down. Hello. Yes, Mr. Arsalan. Yes, we have left the office, 
and we are reaching you in a while. And today we will finalize this deal. Yes. 
Son. Forgive me. Fine, I am coming to you 
in a while. Okay. Son, that… I said forgive me! 
Go from here! You couldn’t recognize 
these eyes, right? I went crazy crying 
in your memory. I am your mother. I have brought you up. I have done your upbringing. 
I don’t want to talk to you about anything. But I want to talk to you Salman. I want to talk. I didn’t bring you up like this, that you stop caring about people. And that you only become 
the slave of your stubbornness. I didn’t bring you up like this. Why are you disturbing me?
Huh? Disturb? We are disturbing you? You have disturbed all of us, 
Salman. After me and Arooj, you have become the enemy of innocent people like sister Naseema
and master Shoaib. I didn’t do anything, and even if I have done something, then I am not answerable 
to your useless questions. I don’t want to make you 
answerable for anything, either. Just tell me, don’t you miss your mother? Don’t you miss her? I don’t have an answer for 
these useless things.
