So, then, tell me, how did you like shopping? You are really good. You too are really good. We spent such good 
time together after so long. I really liked it. Me too. Now quickly sign this file,
 so that the work on Areej textile
 starts from tomorrow. Yes, so tell me, 
where do I need to sign? Fine, you do it. Here is the pen. Come in... Younger madam, Areej is crying really badly. I tried a lot to make 
her get quiet, but she is not getting quiet. So, where is mama? I don’t know about that. I came to you. Oh no, okay, I will see. I will just come, Salman. Is she crying a lot? This paper is left. This idiot had to 
come right now. Mad woman. What should I do? She has not come till now. I will have to see. You, yourself are living 
in such a big home with your wife and son, that too with luxuries. You tell me, do you want to go and 
live in that home? Really? Can this really make 
me happen? Can this happen? Wife of mine, it is going 
to happen in a few days. I don’t understand anything. Hey, I told you I am 
coming from the lawyer. Shaista and Salman 
are thinking, I got the papers made
 in Salman’s name. Then? No one will even find out, as soon as Arooj signs,
 everything will be mine. That’s it, then 
I will leave Shaista. I have had enough of her, 
she has grown old. I know that. After all, I am in your life. Yes, that is true. Hey, I have to get to the office. I cannot let Salman talk to 
the lawyer directly at any cost. Or else the secret will be out. Yes, tell me, why did you call? Idrees, I wanted to ask if Arooj has put the wealth 
in your name or not? What nonsense is this? If there was something like this, 
I would tell you. But why are you 
scolding me, Idrees? What all have I not 
thought of for that wealth. I have dreamed of so much. How will we live in that home, what will we do? Okay. Okay. Fine, put down the phone. Don’t spoil it. 
Okay, goodbye. Id…rees. Why did Idrees 
disconnect the call? Yes, Shaista, what is the news? Salman will bring the good news. Then you will see what I do to this Arooj. I am dreaming of something else. Huh? What dreams? No, nothing. Son. Salman took 
a long time today. I will not be able to sleep
 out of happiness tonight. You are too much. Hard work will pay off today. I don’t know when he will come. Leave me. Come on. Come on. Come on. Leave me. Leave me. Listen to me. I am telling you, leave from here. Where do I go? To the home I bought you,
 where else? I will come and meet you. I am here, meet me here. Why are you insisting? We are living such a good life. We? Not we, only you and your first wife. You have put me on the side. I am telling you, I will fix everything, believe me. Enough. That’s it Idrees. I don’t believe you and 
your false promises now. I want respect for our
 relationship in society. Hey, so you announced it. Stop it now. Leave. Why should I go? I will not go from here. I am your wife and I want the right of
 being your wife. Wife? Will you live your life quietly or else, you will suffer all your life. You will not be able to prove 
that we have been married. This wedding is a secret wedding. Proving it is impossible. You have the wedding papers, right? That’s all my doing or else you said that what is the need to 
put this in writing. This is useless. Okay man, I am sorry. Forgive me. Okay, do one thing, here keep this cheque 
of two hundred thousand, shop for what you want. This is less. Hey, so you will get more. Idrees, I am not talking 
about the money. I don’t want to keep 
our wedding a secret now. Arooj taught you this 
lesson, right? First you promise me, 
you will stay away from her. And no one should find 
out this new address, your number should 
also be new. In return, I promise you, that once I get  my hands
 on this business and properties, after that, I will get rid of Shaista, it will just be you and me. Yes. Is Idrees fooling me once again? If this happens this time, 
then remember, Idrees, I am the one who made
 your life heaven, I will be the one who 
will make it hell too. I will make sure I snatch the 
interpretation of all my dreams from you. Now I will not make any
 compromise in my life. I think she has gone to sleep. That’s how it is. The child finds peace
 coming to their mother. Wasai, where is mama? She went to make Areej’s feeder. She was saying I will make it with my own hands. Arooj… Lower your voice, she is sleeping. Arooj, where are you? I have been searching 
for you for so long. Yes, you go ahead.
 I am coming. No, you come with me. Hey, I am telling you, I will come. She will wake up right now. Okay fine, but I am waiting for you. What happened? What happened? Wasai, you go check on mama 
in the kitchen. Sure. I will go check on her. Arooj. Arooj, child, when did you come from dinner? You didn’t even tell me. Where can this girl be? I have put all my property, business, and this home
 in Areej’s name. You put everything in 
Areej’s name? Yes, Mehreen, child, even if you give your life for 
your daughter, it is less. Daughters are such beings. and my Salman? Don’t worry, Mehreen, I will not be unjust to him either. Okay sir, me and Mr. Idrees are 
going to the site, so we will leave now. Fine, Mr. Hashim, you go ahead, we are coming. Okay sir, thank you. Where are you going, son? Today, we will lay the foundation 
of our new factory, Areej textile. and my daughter too will go with us. Arooj. What happened? You look worried. No sister in law, actually, I was looking for Arooj. She must be with Salman. I have told you so many times, let them both spend time together. Don’t you understand this? Yes, sister in law, you are right. My Salman came to me today before
 going to the office. So, what can I do? You did what you had to. The hatred you had put in Salman’s
 mind against me and Arooj, it is over now. He has found out 
who truly loves him. What is the matter 
sister in law, Shaista, you are not saying anything. Okay fine, I will see Salman too. You can see him. You can surely see him when my Salman is with me. Do see him. Where did the documents go? I had kept them here. Wasai... Wasai... What is the matter, mama? Why are you so worried? Speak up, what happened? Arooj, have you gone mad? j What were you going to do? I don’t understand anything. What are you trying to say? Look at it and also understand it. Your signature is on two papers, and on the third paper… I give up all my property, business and this home, and I am putting all of this in Idrees Ahmed’s name? Meaning, in uncle’s name? Okay. So this was Salman’s love. Hah, so called fake love. All this was going to be put 
in brother Idrees’ name. This means, those two have
 also used our Salman in this. He is not a child, mama. He too was with them 
in this conspiracy. Okay, no issues. We will see how many 
more days he does... ... this drama of his false 
love with you and me. I made a big mistake. I don’t know what will 
happen to me. I made a big mistake. Please, forgive me. Okay come on, sit up. You are going to the office, your clothes will get ruined. No, I will not sit up till 
you forgive me. Salman, come on, sit here first. First tell me, will you forgive me? We will talk. Come on, sit here. Look Salman, we will forget whatever happened. But you promise something. Yes, what promise? I will accept it. You won’t say anything to Arooj. I would like it if you 
two live with love. Arooj too wants this, and now she has become the mother of 
your daughter. You are right. I promise you, I will not say anything to her. She will forgive me, right? Wasai. Wasai. Yes, little master? There was a file in my room, 
have you seen it? No little master, I have not seen it. Okay fine, leave from here. Sure. What happened? What are you looking for? Arooj, the file that you were signing, it was in my room. I cannot find it. Yes, yes, so what happened? Where did the file go? I had signed it. Yes, but one paper was left. So, come on, give it, I will sign it right away. How will you sign it? If I find it, then you will sign it. I have seen the entire home,
 it is nowhere. Hey, so it is our own home, it will be somewhere here, 
we will find it. By the way, I have not seen you so restless for anything
 before today. That was uncle Waqar’s dream, that I had to fulfill. I had planned everything, what do I do now? I will go and search for
 it downstairs again. See, Arooj, I had told you, my Salman is really good at heart. He has realised his mistake. I am really sorry, Arooj. It is my fault. I admit it. I am really sorry. I shouldn’t have done all this. I admit my mistake, if you want you can punish me. What are you doing? Hit me. It is my fault. What are you doing? Plan my foot. I will never let this plan 
of yours be successful. Shaista, sit down, why are you tiring yourself? Sit down. Why have you come 
empty handed? Where is the file? Salman, I am asking you. What happened? Did Arooj refuse to sign it? She is really cunning, she must have read that everything will get 
out of her hands… It is not that, dad. She was trusting me 
completely, but Wasai came at the
 last moment and took her. Everything was left incomplete. So? So, now? That Arooj has really good luck. Now I cannot find that file.
