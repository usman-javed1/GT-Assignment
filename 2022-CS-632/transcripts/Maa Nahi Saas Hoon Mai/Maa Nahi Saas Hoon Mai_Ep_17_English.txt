Okay then fix the meeting for 
10 o clock tomorrow and rest of the things 
we will discuss there tomorrow. All right thank you. salman, you have taken so much pressure of work, your health will be affected. Arooj, I have to work, look all the decisions of the office 
are under me. Take this. Thank you. I didn’t get coffee in your house and both of you are enjoying tea here,
dude, very nice. Alizey, come join us. No, no, I don’t want to have tea,
I want to have coffee only. Let’s do one thing, let’s go to 
some coffee shop and have coffee. Okay, let’s all 3 of us go, let’s go out. Salman, it is much better if we both go. I mean, 3 people, 
it will just increase the crowd. Arooj? Arooj? Why did your mood get off
 all of a sudden? I am your life partner, I am not crowd. Arooj, I am so sorry, I didn’t mean that at all. Arooj, don’t mind Alizey, she just randomly say things. It’s okay, you guys go. Arooj, please, look, if you won’t go 
I won’t be interested. Okay. And you know what? They have very good pastries, 
you will really like them. Let’s go. Let’s go. 
Hmm, let’s go. I had no idea that you don’t know 
how to make coffee, that is why I asked you, it’s good that you effused and 
saved your honor. No, no, your idea is absolutely wrong, actually, maid works in our house, so you asked wrong people 
for coffee at wrong time. Arooj, by the way you make up 
nice stories. Hmm, and coffee as well. By the way, I do everything according 
to Salman’s mood, I make coffee when he wants to have it. That means, Salman hasn’t gotten 
good coffee for ages, right? Your idea is absolutely wrong. Sorry, I got a very important call. What happened, 
why are you guys so quiet? You guys didn’t even eat anything, have it please it’s very tasty. Arooj, you should try this, it’s tasty. Hmm, yummy. Yeah, it’s really good. I have spoken to Afzal.. Madam, you called me? Where are Salman and Arooj? All 3 of them have gone somewhere 
since evening. All 3 of them? 
Who is the third one? That Alizey madam. What happened, madam? Nothing, you may go. Okay. Third person between the two? Third? Hmm, Salman, try it. Umm, Arooj. Just a little. It’s very sweet. But it’s very nice. 
Hmm. By the way, Salman, you are a cheater. Cheater, what do you mean? Do you remember you were showing 
your palm to a palmist once? And he told you that 
the one you will marry, her name will start with an A and I always used to get happy thinking that my name starts with an A as well but you turned out to be a cheater. So the palmist was absolutely right, he said that my would-be wife’s name 
will start with an A see, Arooj’s name is from an A. Urooj doesn’t start with an A, it Urooj starts with U, Salman. Let’s ask, right Urooj? Salman said it absolutely right, I don’t right Aroon with a U but an A. I am really sorry guys, there is another important call, 
I will join you guys in a while. Hello? Yes? Hmm, by the way look Salman didn’t 
change much, I mean, he still likes cappuccino till date. I thought that it has been so long his taste might have changed but no he didn’t change. What? It is a very cheap thing to do. Arooj? Umm, Salman? Make sure the black coffee is strong 
and bring it to my room. I hope you had fun. A little bit but what actually happened there has 
really spoiled my mood. Just forget it. I didn’t know she was going 
to react like this. I told you to forget it, let bygones be bygones. Greetings aunt. Greetings, where were you? Mom called, is everything okay? I don’t find her way of things to be right. You are coming behind right now, I don’t want you to be left behind in future. Go, rest, hmm? Okay. Let’s do one thing, let’s go to some coffee shop 
and have coffee. Okay, let’s all 3 of us go, let’s go out. Salman, it is much better if we both go. I mean, 3 people, it will just 
increase the crowd. I mean, he still likes cappuccino till date. I thought that it has been so long his taste might have changed but no he didn’t change. What? It is a very cheap thing to do. Okay take very good care of yourself, I will see you in the night. Okay. 
Bye. Bye Arooj. 
Bye. What happened mom? You were very quiet at breakfast to, 
is anything worrying you? How can I have any worried 
when you are here, hmm? So then? Nothing, tell me when will you
 come back from office? I have a meeting in the evening,
I will come by night. Okay, bring Arooj’s reports 
on your way back. Oh, I forgot, what was the date? Arooj? I remember the date is for today. I am waiting every moment. I know, you keep accounts of everything 
related to me. I will bring the reports. hmm, it is important to keep accounts of 
everything related to you. Okay, I will see you tonight. Bye. Bye. The decision will be made 
after your reports are here that do we have to buy 
more toys or not. Don’t worry at all, your toys won’t go to waste. They better not. I want to talk to you. About what? Say it? You know what I am talking about? what do you want to talk about 
that you are here for it? Say it? I am your son’s wife, would you tolerate it if the same behavior 
happens with your own daughter? you gave my answer in your own question that you are my daughter in law, not my daughter. I am not your daughter but I am like your daughter. Yes, but I guess you don’t know that there is a lot of difference between 
being a daughter and being like a daughter. But if you want you remove this difference. Nothing happens by what I want 
and what I don’t want, if you call me mother will I 
become your mother? No, right? Similarly, you are my daughter in law, you can never be my daughter, go and send Wasai to me. Okay. Is this girl mad? She is trying to be my daughter 
for no reason, why would you be my daughter? aunt if I am not your daughter but I am someone’s daughter. Whoever’s daughter you are, expect that love from them, I will not love you. If I accept you as a mother so then can’t you accept me as 
your daughter and love me? How can I accept my daughter in law as my daughter? I just have one child and that is my son, Salman. Just for the sake of Salman’s choice, accept his choice as your daughter. How should I just forcefully 
accept you as my daughter? Madam Jr, my husband is here again. What can I do if he is here? You only said you will help me, that is why I came here to tell you. I apologize. Wait, Wasai. I am sorry Wasai, I am a bit worried so that is why 
I misbehaved with you. Is your husband here? Okay, make him sit at the gate 
and stay with him, don’t go anywhere, 
I will do something. As you say. hello, Darakshan, do you know I told you 
about a drug addict, he is outside my house, 
you call him, okay. But listen the treatment should be 
very good. Thank you. Bye. Leave me. Wasai. 
Wasai, look, Wasai? 
help me. Where are you taking me? yes, madam? Couldn’t you hear me? 
Where were you? I was at the gate. What is this noise on the gate. My Husband was here. You know that he is a drug addict and every other day he asks me for money. Okay so what happened now? Actually, one day madam Jr saw him so she called them the ones 
who treats drug addicts, so he was just yelling when 
he was going with them. You may go from here, go. Okay. How many things should I cry over 
and get sad about? Now this Madam Arooj will also solve 
the problems of the servants of this house? Poor things… Typical…
Greetings. Greetings. How are you mom? 
How are you? I am good, by the way, Aunt Mehreen was waiting for you
 more than me. Really? Why is that so? I had just hear till today that 
mothers love so much, I mean, my mother doesn’t love me 
as much as aunt Mehreen loves you, Salman. True that. After all why shouldn’t I love Salman, 
Alizey? Who else do I have except him 
in this world? Hmm, exactly. So you are coming directly 
from the office? Hmm, why? no, aunt was telling that you had 
to collect some reports I guess, from the clinic, I think Arooj’s. Oh yes, I was so stuck in the meeting that… So then who will go to pick it up? Mom, I called them, 
they will deliver it at home. Hmm, right, come sit. Sir, there is this letter for you. I think it’s the report. Open it. Read what is written. Salman. Salman, tell us what is it. Arooj, Arooj can never be a mother. The decision will be made 
after your reports are here that do we have to buy more toys or not. Don’t worry at all, your toys won’t go to waste. They better not. I don’t find her way of things to be right. You are coming behind right now, I don’t want you to be left behind
 in the future. Arooj, Arooj can never be a mother. Arooj? Arooj, why do you worry? How should I not worry? This is a huge and a very bad news, 
Salman that I can never be a mother. Arooj, look, trust me, you don’t have to worry, 
everything will be fine. I am so scared. Scared of what? Aunt Mehreen’s silence. Arooj, what is wrong with you? You are scared of her 
when she speaks and now you are scared 
when she is quiet. Salman this is not something minor, I don’t understand aunt Mehreen 
being quiet on such a huge thing. She must be shocked, 
that is why she is quiet. what do you mean by
 she is in shock? It means that you are even shocked about it, right? There is nothing like that, trust me. Arooj, everything will be fine. I am here. Who is it? Sir, Madam Sr is calling you. okay, you may go, I am coming. Okay. Yes mom, you called? What will happen now, Salman? About what? You are unaware of such a huge thing
that happened at home? Mom, it is important for you but not for me. It is important, it is very important. The happiness of this house 
is connected to this thing. Your name is connected. Okay tell me what do you want? I want you to get Arooj treated then I will see what I have to do. what my child? You have made such a face 
like it is the end of times. whatever happened is no less than 
the end of times. Why do you worry? Don’t worry at all? Just wait and see we will consult 
some good doctor and why aren’t you thinking that the reports could be wrong. you are comforting me, the one that I got tested by is a 
very renowned doctor. I accept she is a renowned doctor, 
but she is not the last one. You understand what I am saying. I don’t expect anything good 
from aunt Mehreen. Just leave what Mehreen is saying. Do you know that Mehreen conceived a child 
after many years of her marriage. Mom never asked for any such reports. But aunt doesn’t think like grandma. You are worried because of 
Mehreen’s strict behavior, right? Aunt Mehreen will never understand 
my pain, you can because you have gone through 
the pain of being childless. I am not childless, Arooj but I am empty-handed, I cannot even tell anyone that I am not childless, I have given birth to Salman, he is my son. My grief is way greater than yours.
