[20.80] Okay then fix the meeting for 
10 o clock tomorrow
[23.52] and rest of the things 
we will discuss there tomorrow.
[28.80] All right thank you.
[33.12] salman,
[34.32] you have taken so much pressure of work,
[36.52] your health will be affected.
[38.60] Arooj, I have to work,
[40.88] look all the decisions of the office 
are under me.
[44.24] Take this.
[45.60] Thank you.
[47.92] I didn’t get coffee in your house
[51.28] and both of you are enjoying tea here,
dude, very nice.
[58.96] Alizey, come join us.
[62.16] No, no, I don’t want to have tea,
I want to have coffee only.
[66.40] Let’s do one thing, let’s go to 
some coffee shop and have coffee.
[70.80] Okay, let’s all 3 of us go, let’s go out.
[77.40] Salman, it is much better if we both go.
[81.04] I mean, 3 people, 
it will just increase the crowd.
[93.52] Arooj?
[94.64] Arooj?
[101.32] Why did your mood get off
 all of a sudden?
[107.84] I am your life partner,
[110.52] I am not crowd.
[114.96] Arooj, I am so sorry,
[117.68] I didn’t mean that at all.
[120.56] Arooj,
[122.48] don’t mind Alizey,
[124.84] she just randomly say things.
[128.16] It’s okay, you guys go.
[130.48] Arooj,
[136.64] please, look, if you won’t go 
I won’t be interested.
[145.00] Okay.
[146.36] And you know what?
[147.48] They have very good pastries, 
you will really like them.
[151.56] Let’s go.
[152.56] Let’s go. 
Hmm, let’s go.
[171.16] I had no idea that you don’t know 
how to make coffee,
[177.72] that is why I asked you,
[183.08] it’s good that you effused and 
saved your honor.
[189.72] No, no,
[191.28] your idea is absolutely wrong,
[193.80] actually, maid works in our house,
[196.32] so you asked wrong people 
for coffee at wrong time.
[201.28] Arooj, by the way you make up 
nice stories.
[204.20] Hmm, and coffee as well.
[208.56] By the way, I do everything according 
to Salman’s mood,
[212.04] I make coffee when he wants to have it.
[220.60] That means, Salman hasn’t gotten 
good coffee for ages, right?
[228.92] Your idea is absolutely wrong.
[234.04] Sorry, I got a very important call.
[238.56] What happened, 
why are you guys so quiet?
[241.36] You guys didn’t even eat anything,
[243.72] have it please it’s very tasty.
[250.08] Arooj, you should try this, it’s tasty.
[259.84] Hmm, yummy.
[261.52] Yeah, it’s really good.
[275.12] I have spoken to Afzal..
[277.92] Madam, you called me?
[281.60] Where are Salman and Arooj?
[283.92] All 3 of them have gone somewhere 
since evening.
[287.40] All 3 of them? 
Who is the third one?
[290.68] That Alizey madam.
[298.28] What happened, madam?
[301.60] Nothing, you may go.
[303.88] Okay.
[311.96] Third person between the two?
[315.04] Third?
[326.36] Hmm, Salman, try it.
[329.56] Umm, Arooj.
[331.68] Just a little.
[338.48] It’s very sweet.
[339.44] But it’s very nice. 
Hmm.
[341.80] By the way, Salman,
[346.88] you are a cheater.
[350.72] Cheater, what do you mean?
[359.76] Do you remember you were showing 
your palm to a palmist once?
[367.08] And he told you that 
the one you will marry,
[372.20] her name will start with an A
[381.16] and I always used to get happy thinking
[387.88] that my name starts with an A as well
[400.36] but you turned out to be a cheater.
[406.68] So the palmist was absolutely right,
[409.68] he said that my would-be wife’s name 
will start with an A
[413.08] see, Arooj’s name is from an A.
[419.04] Urooj doesn’t start with an A,
[422.28] it Urooj starts with U, Salman.
[429.48] Let’s ask, right Urooj?
[434.32] Salman said it absolutely right,
[437.32] I don’t right Aroon with a U but an A.
[450.44] I am really sorry guys,
[451.80] there is another important call, 
I will join you guys in a while.
[456.32] Hello?
[458.24] Yes?
[460.20] Hmm,
[461.96] by the way look Salman didn’t 
change much,
[466.08] I mean, he still likes cappuccino till date.
[471.32] I thought that it has been so long
[473.96] his taste might have changed
[476.52] but no he didn’t change.
[482.32] What?
[485.44] It is a very cheap thing to do.
[499.16] Arooj?
[501.08] Umm, Salman?
[524.76] Make sure the black coffee is strong 
and bring it to my room.
[529.20] I hope you had fun.
[531.64] A little bit
[533.60] but what actually happened there has 
really spoiled my mood.
[538.96] Just forget it.
[540.72] I didn’t know she was going 
to react like this.
[543.56] I told you to forget it,
[545.56] let bygones be bygones.
[566.16] Greetings aunt.
[568.40] Greetings,
[570.32] where were you?
[571.60] Mom called, is everything okay?
[578.08] I don’t find her way of things to be right.
[584.96] You are coming behind right now,
[589.16] I don’t want you to be left behind in future.
[596.28] Go,
[598.28] rest, hmm?
[601.08] Okay.
[667.04] Let’s do one thing,
[668.36] let’s go to some coffee shop 
and have coffee.
[671.48] Okay, let’s all 3 of us go, let’s go out.
[676.88] Salman, it is much better if we both go.
[680.56] I mean, 3 people, it will just 
increase the crowd.
[693.96] I mean, he still likes cappuccino till date.
[699.00] I thought that it has been so long
[701.80] his taste might have changed
[704.36] but no he didn’t change.
[710.56] What?
[713.44] It is a very cheap thing to do.
[752.32] Okay take very good care of yourself,
[754.24] I will see you in the night.
[756.00] Okay. 
Bye.
[758.32] Bye Arooj. 
Bye.
[766.32] What happened mom?
[768.36] You were very quiet at breakfast to, 
is anything worrying you?
[776.24] How can I have any worried 
when you are here, hmm?
[781.92] So then?
[783.72] Nothing, tell me when will you
 come back from office?
[788.44] I have a meeting in the evening,
I will come by night.
[793.76] Okay, bring Arooj’s reports 
on your way back.
[802.40] Oh,
[803.60] I forgot, what was the date? Arooj?
[807.64] I remember the date is for today.
[810.24] I am waiting every moment.
[816.32] I know,
[818.76] you keep accounts of everything 
related to me.
[821.64] I will bring the reports.
[823.36] hmm,
[825.00] it is important to keep accounts of 
everything related to you.
[833.20] Okay, I will see you tonight. Bye.
[836.44] Bye.
[855.80] The decision will be made 
after your reports are here
[861.12] that do we have to buy 
more toys or not.
[869.12] Don’t worry at all,
[875.00] your toys won’t go to waste.
[880.64] They better not.
[945.76] I want to talk to you.
[950.24] About what? Say it?
[955.56] You know what I am talking about?
[960.64] what do you want to talk about 
that you are here for it?
[965.44] Say it?
[973.28] I am your son’s wife,
[979.72] would you tolerate it if the same behavior 
happens with your own daughter?
[986.60] you gave my answer in your own question
[991.60] that you are my daughter in law,
[994.16] not my daughter.
[996.76] I am not your daughter
[999.20] but I am like your daughter.
[1001.96] Yes,
[1003.92] but I guess you don’t know
[1006.00] that there is a lot of difference between 
being a daughter and being like a daughter.
[1014.04] But if you want you remove this difference.
[1017.96] Nothing happens by what I want 
and what I don’t want,
[1021.36] if you call me mother will I 
become your mother?
[1030.44] No, right?
[1032.32] Similarly, you are my daughter in law,
[1036.20] you can never be my daughter,
[1042.44] go and send Wasai to me.
[1046.60] Okay.
[1099.56] Is this girl mad?
[1104.20] She is trying to be my daughter 
for no reason,
[1110.12] why would you be my daughter?
[1123.80] aunt if I am not your daughter
[1129.48] but I am someone’s daughter.
[1134.44] Whoever’s daughter you are,
[1137.56] expect that love from them,
[1141.76] I will not love you.
[1146.12] If I accept you as a mother
[1154.48] so then can’t you accept me as 
your daughter and love me?
[1159.08] How can I accept
[1161.52] my daughter in law as my daughter?
[1164.96] I just have one child
[1168.44] and that is my son, Salman.
[1177.28] Just for the sake of Salman’s choice,
[1180.36] accept his choice as your daughter.
[1184.68] How should I just forcefully 
accept you as my daughter?
[1279.52] Madam Jr, my husband is here again.
[1285.88] What can I do if he is here?
[1289.00] You only said you will help me,
[1296.24] that is why I came here to tell you.
[1302.00] I apologize.
[1306.32] Wait, Wasai.
[1311.96] I am sorry Wasai,
[1315.20] I am a bit worried so that is why 
I misbehaved with you.
[1323.00] Is your husband here?
[1326.88] Okay, make him sit at the gate 
and stay with him,
[1330.96] don’t go anywhere, 
I will do something.
[1334.84] As you say.
[1352.04] hello, Darakshan,
[1355.64] do you know I told you 
about a drug addict,
[1359.92] he is outside my house, 
you call him,
[1365.84] okay.
[1367.60] But listen the treatment should be 
very good.
[1373.04] Thank you. Bye.
[1404.72] Leave me.
[1405.80] Wasai. 
Wasai,
[1408.32] look, Wasai? 
help me.
[1411.44] Where are you taking me?
[1413.16] yes, madam?
[1414.80] Couldn’t you hear me? 
Where were you?
[1417.56] I was at the gate.
[1419.76] What is this noise on the gate.
[1421.76] My Husband was here.
[1425.00] You know that he is a drug addict
[1428.80] and every other day he asks me for money.
[1431.44] Okay so what happened now?
[1434.20] Actually, one day madam Jr saw him
[1437.60] so she called them the ones 
who treats drug addicts,
[1443.12] so he was just yelling when 
he was going with them.
[1449.44] You may go from here, go.
[1452.60] Okay.
[1460.00] How many things should I cry over 
and get sad about?
[1465.12] Now this Madam Arooj will also solve 
the problems of the servants of this house?
[1484.24] Poor things…
[1486.32] Typical…
Greetings.
[1488.40] Greetings.
[1489.84] How are you mom? 
How are you?
[1491.72] I am good, by the way,
[1495.36] Aunt Mehreen was waiting for you
 more than me.
[1499.96] Really? Why is that so?
[1502.84] I had just hear till today that 
mothers love so much,
[1507.28] I mean, my mother doesn’t love me 
as much as aunt Mehreen loves you, Salman.
[1513.76] True that.
[1515.92] After all why shouldn’t I love Salman, 
Alizey?
[1522.52] Who else do I have except him 
in this world?
[1528.76] Hmm, exactly.
[1532.44] So you are coming directly 
from the office?
[1535.52] Hmm, why?
[1538.12] no,
[1539.64] aunt was telling that you had 
to collect some reports I guess,
[1544.72] from the clinic, I think Arooj’s.
[1551.96] Oh yes,
[1554.20] I was so stuck in the meeting that…
[1556.16] So then who will go to pick it up?
[1559.88] Mom, I called them, 
they will deliver it at home.
[1565.96] Hmm, right, come sit.
[1571.76] Sir, there is this letter for you.
[1575.04] I think it’s the report.
[1576.76] Open it.
[1599.76] Read what is written. Salman.
[1611.76] Salman, tell us what is it.
[1617.28] Arooj,
[1622.00] Arooj can never be a mother.
[1705.76] The decision will be made 
after your reports are here
[1710.92] that do we have to buy more toys or not.
[1718.84] Don’t worry at all,
[1724.56] your toys won’t go to waste.
[1729.16] They better not.
[1736.96] I don’t find her way of things to be right.
[1743.92] You are coming behind right now,
[1747.80] I don’t want you to be left behind
 in the future.
[1753.36] Arooj,
[1758.04] Arooj can never be a mother.
[1805.00] Arooj?
[1809.28] Arooj, why do you worry?
[1819.00] How should I not worry?
[1823.12] This is a huge and a very bad news, 
Salman
[1828.92] that I can never be a mother.
[1834.36] Arooj, look,
[1836.96] trust me,
[1840.84] you don’t have to worry, 
everything will be fine.
[1845.20] I am so scared.
[1847.60] Scared of what?
[1850.56] Aunt Mehreen’s silence.
[1854.04] Arooj, what is wrong with you?
[1857.40] You are scared of her 
when she speaks
[1860.20] and now you are scared 
when she is quiet.
[1863.52] Salman this is not something minor,
[1867.24] I don’t understand aunt Mehreen 
being quiet on such a huge thing.
[1873.28] She must be shocked, 
that is why she is quiet.
[1883.12] what do you mean by
 she is in shock?
[1890.80] It means
[1894.52] that you are even shocked about it, right?
[1898.24] There is nothing like that, trust me.
[1904.40] Arooj, everything will be fine.
[1909.88] I am here.
[1916.00] Who is it?
[1926.36] Sir,
[1928.80] Madam Sr is calling you.
[1934.72] okay, you may go, I am coming.
[1936.80] Okay.
[1972.76] Yes mom, you called?
[1981.52] What will happen now, Salman?
[1985.04] About what?
[1986.64] You are unaware of such a huge thing
that happened at home?
[1992.44] Mom, it is important for you
[1995.44] but not for me.
[1996.64] It is important, it is very important.
[2002.56] The happiness of this house 
is connected to this thing.
[2005.40] Your name is connected.
[2008.48] Okay tell me what do you want?
[2015.64] I want you to get Arooj treated
[2021.80] then I will see what I have to do.
[2097.12] what my child?
[2099.28] You have made such a face 
like it is the end of times.
[2104.96] whatever happened is no less than 
the end of times.
[2110.12] Why do you worry?
[2112.64] Don’t worry at all?
[2114.36] Just wait and see we will consult 
some good doctor
[2122.00] and why aren’t you thinking
[2123.84] that the reports could be wrong.
[2128.48] you are comforting me,
[2134.64] the one that I got tested by is a 
very renowned doctor.
[2137.88] I accept she is a renowned doctor, 
but she is not the last one.
[2145.92] You understand what I am saying.
[2150.88] I don’t expect anything good 
from aunt Mehreen.
[2155.28] Just leave what Mehreen is saying.
[2157.60] Do you know
[2159.16] that Mehreen conceived a child 
after many years of her marriage.
[2162.52] Mom never asked for any such reports.
[2166.00] But aunt doesn’t think like grandma.
[2170.52] You are worried because of 
Mehreen’s strict behavior, right?
[2173.76] Aunt Mehreen will never understand 
my pain,
[2177.72] you can
[2184.80] because you have gone through 
the pain of being childless.
[2200.64] I am not childless, Arooj
[2204.12] but I am empty-handed,
[2208.76] I cannot even tell anyone
[2211.44] that I am not childless,
[2213.76] I have given birth to Salman,
[2216.68] he is my son.
[2224.00] My grief is way greater than yours.
