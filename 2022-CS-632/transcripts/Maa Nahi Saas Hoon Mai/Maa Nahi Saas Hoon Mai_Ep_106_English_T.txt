[23.16] What did you do?
[26.56] What else could I do?
[28.00] You were saying 
you would divorce her?
[30.44] Yes, absolutely.
[38.08] After what she has done, 
she deserves to be divorced.
[42.12] You shouldn't do anything like that.
[47.84] You do one thing,
[49.44] have a chip installed in me and then
 keep the remote control for it with you.
[57.80] Then whatever you say, 
however you say, I will do it.
[60.12] Then I will not have any 
thinking of my own.
[61.80] Salman, don't forget, everything
 still belongs to Arooj.
[74.64] Arooj leaving your life means 
you have lost everything.
[78.28] I don't care about that.
[87.68] But, I will take such revenge 
for the slap,
[93.04] that the echo of it, won't let her
sleep at night.
[98.60] At times, you need to take
two steps back to win the war.
[102.52] This is called strategy 
and not defeat, son.
[105.76] Think.
[143.04] We are leaving.
[148.32] But, don't think that
[152.92] we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people.
[158.44] Mama...
[166.64] But...
[178.12] I will come back,
[189.88] and I will surely come back.
[195.08] This is my promise to all of you.
[246.92] I don't know what would be 
happening there.
[251.28] They are really cruel people.
[257.28] Arooj shouldn't have gone there,
[259.76] those people will become 
more violent.
[267.12] We shouldn't have let her go alone.
[276.08] We didn't find out. 
She left in a moment.
[281.80] Did you call her?
[284.44] Yes, I did,
[286.52] but her number is off.
[296.52] God have mercy.
[302.44] Arooj.
[307.36] Areej.
[335.36] Arooj,
[337.04] how did you bring Areej with you?
[340.16] How did those people give
 Areej to you?
[355.80] How could they not give her?
[361.08] A mother went to bring 
her daughter.
[376.24] Here,
[378.04] give her to me.
[381.16] Not right now.
[383.88] She slept with difficulty.
[408.40] What did those people say?
[410.12] Tell us something.
[413.96] What would they say?
[416.36] The people who should talk to us
lowering their gaze,
[424.28] if those same people try to raise 
their eyes and try to talk,
[428.88] then you should wait for the bad 
times of those people.
[441.12] Child, you shouldn't have argued
 with Salman.
[445.64] Why?
[446.80] I want to see you settled 
in your home, child.
[450.44] So, Salman's parents should 
also think this.
[454.16] We are the parents of the girl,
[457.00] we will have to bow down.
[472.60] We will surely have to bow down.
Surely.
[475.40] But not so much
[477.24] that we cut our necks and
keep it in their feet.
[497.88] He had pushed you, right?
Huh?
[507.24] I have settled the score 
for that push.
[518.96] What did you do, Arooj?
[549.08] What did you do?
[555.48] I have taught him a lesson.
[558.52] I have responded to the push 
with a slap.
[591.40] You did bad.
[597.72] You did really bad.
[619.72] Arooj,
[621.64] take Areej inside.
[739.28] Arooj.
[759.12] If you feel that
[761.92] my decision to leave home 
was wrong,
[766.00] then we will go back home.
[769.40] No,
[771.60] I am standing with you 
in your decision.
[780.68] Now we will see
[785.80] whatever happens.
[829.12] Is everything okay?
[831.20] Why are you walking like this?
[832.76] I am fine. I am fine.
[837.60] Where did you go?
[841.40] I went to meet Salman.
[851.00] To meet Salman?
[853.24] Why?
[856.52] To talk about your issue.
[868.28] I told him to save his home 
from being ruined.
[877.92] Then?
[878.76] Then what did he say?
[881.72] He cursed me.
[891.20] And he pushed me down.
[905.36] What has happened to you Salman?
[914.24] You were never like this.
[922.48] Why are you doing this?
[924.44] Why?
[932.48] I didn’t bring you up like this.
[994.12] You pushed my father? Huh?
[996.40] You pushed him?
[998.44] Push me. Hit me.
[1000.60] Why don’t you hit me?
[1002.60] What do you think of yourself?
[1004.40] What is this arrogance for?
[1006.52] Respect. Fame.
[1008.32] Why are you quiet? 
Speak up.
[1010.20] Lower your voice.
[1013.00] This is my home,
[1014.72] you are not allowed to talk
loudly here.
[1017.16] I will talk loudly.
[1019.96] And what is this home 
you are talking about?
[1023.84] Two minutes.
[1025.40] The ground from under your feet 
will be pulled in two minutes.
[1033.44] Areej.
[1035.52] Areej.
[1037.48] You cannot take Areej.
[1039.04] You cannot keep a daughter away 
from her mother.
[1041.08] I will stop you.
Leave me.
[1042.76] Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it.
[1044.24] Leave it…
[1053.96] She raised her hand at Salman
[1099.80] Sir Salman.
[1101.28] Why did you come here?
[1102.64] Sir Salman, are you feeling okay?
[1104.20] Go from here.
[1106.72] Leave!
[1123.56] If you take Areej from here,
then I will kill you.
[1127.88] You will kill me?
[1129.68] Kill me.
[1134.84] Kill me. Shoot.
[1137.36] Why don’t you shoot?
Murder me.
[1140.04] Tell Areej that a mother sacrificed 
her life for her daughter.
[1145.92] Shoot.
[1147.28] Come on, shoot.
[1149.36] Hey, leave it. 
Coward.
[1151.56] How will you shoot someone?
[1155.08] It will cost you a lot to take Areej.
[1158.28] I am not a businessperson 
like you people,
[1160.88] that I will account for cheap 
and expensive.
[1163.76] I am a mother.
[1165.00] If you take Areej from here,
[1166.84] you will have to face a lot of loss.
[1169.20] I will divorce you.
[1170.80] You can do what you want.
[1213.52] After what she has done, 
she deserves to be divorced.
[1218.68] You shouldn't do anything like that.
[1224.52] You do one thing,
[1225.88] have a chip installed in me and then 
keep the remote control for it with you.
[1231.08] Then whatever you say, 
however you say, I will do it.
[1233.48] Then I will not have any thinking 
of my own.
[1235.24] Salman, don't forget,
[1237.04] everything still belongs to Arooj.
[1244.04] Arooj leaving your life means
you have lost everything.
[1247.48] I don't care about that.
[1254.28] But, I will take such revenge 
for the slap,
[1259.64] that the echo of it, won't let her 
sleep at night.
[1265.20] At times, you need to take two 
steps back to win the war.
[1274.80] My name is Salman.
[1279.40] I have never learned 
to accept defeat,
[1281.96] nor have I learned to lose.
[1287.04] Arooj, what do you think? 
You won and I lost?
[1290.68] No.
[1295.44] You are mistaken.
[1313.40] I will take revenge for this slap,
[1317.12] and I will take it with a profit.
[1322.12] Then you will not find 
a place to hide.
[1327.20] Nowhere.
[1364.80] I am really worried for you, child.
[1371.84] Why are you worried, papa?
[1374.72] Child, the people you have 
stood up against,
[1378.44] they are really influential and 
powerful in every way.
[1381.80] I have only spoken for my right, papa.
[1386.56] What else have I done?
[1390.08] See,
[1391.88] those people dragged you 
out of your own home.
[1396.08] Yes, so you didn’t let me 
take the help of law,
[1407.80] or those people wouldn’t have been
able to drag me out of there.
[1412.36] Help from the law?
[1421.44] Your home will get ruined, child.
[1432.08] Can we not make a truce 
with those people?
[1436.80] Truce?
[1449.12] Okay, tell me,
[1450.80] how can we make a truce?
[1453.56] By agreeing to Salman.
[1457.92] Do you know what he wants?
[1466.40] He wants that this property and
business is put in his name.
[1471.08] Then do this.
[1472.64] Do what he wants.
[1480.52] After all, he is your husband.
[1482.80] Yes, so, Salman should also 
think the same thing.
[1494.40] After all, I am his wife too,
[1496.36] if it is with me or with him, 
it is the same thing.
[1501.60] You have taken a big step,
slapping Salman.
[1515.96] I am afraid that Salman 
will do something
[1524.52] that will not be in your favour.
[1535.64] Papa, whatever happened 
is in front of you.
[1546.52] I don’t understand what 
you are trying to say.
[1554.20] If I say it, you won’t agree.
[1559.28] Go ahead.
[1562.64] You apologize to Salman.
[1576.20] Apologize?
[1586.48] What have I done that 
I apologize for it?
[1595.64] What is my fault?
[1598.32] Child, you be the bigger person.
[1606.16] May God save your home.
[1613.20] You went to him.
[1616.48] Did you not see his behaviour?
[1633.12] I still haven’t lost hope.
[1645.56] Salman is emotional. 
That’s it.
[1706.56] I want to make my final attempt.
[1710.96] Maybe, I will be able to change
 Salman’s heart.
[1717.40] Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t pass from the police station.
[1726.28] I will try my best to save my home.
[1732.76] Even after so much happened?
[1748.12] Only for the sake of my daughter.
[1753.44] I think the same.
[1757.72] You have reduced the burden on 
my heart by saying this.
[1773.00] Okay Naseema, I am going 
for some work.
[1775.48] I will come back soon. 
Suddenly?
[1776.96] What work did you remember?
Where are you going?
[1779.32] Hey, you have started to ask 
too many questions.
[1782.16] Where are you going? 
When will you come back?
[1784.24] So, it is important to ask.
[1786.88] You go anywhere, 
without informing.
[1790.36] Here, there is a reason for me 
going anywhere.
[1793.44] Understand?
[1795.24] Look, you are not well,
[1798.60] that is why inform us and 
go where you are going.
[1802.08] I will tell you every single word 
when I come back,
[1805.12] but right now it is better that 
you don’t drive me mad.
[1810.36] He consults himself,
[1812.88] he didn’t even tell me. I don’t know
what he is planning.
[1816.32] It is up to him, 
he shouldn’t tell me.
[1820.12] What happened, mama? 
Who are you getting upset at?
[1823.04] Your Father.
[1833.72] He thinks himself
[1835.36] and then starts implementing it.
[1839.48] What happened?
[1841.12] He didn’t tell me and he left.
[1845.84] He left? 
Where did he go?
[1848.28] Yes, he went. 
I asked him,
[1850.76] he said that I will tell you 
when I come back.
[1856.12] You know papa doesn’t lie.
[1860.28] What is the meaning of saying
this right now, Arooj?
[1864.32] I mean that the place 
papa has gone to,
[1867.04] he doesn’t want to tell you about it.
[1879.72] That’s why he said I will come back
and tell you.
[1883.76] This means,
[1885.36] you know where, 
Master went.
[1890.92] Yes,
[1898.80] I know where he went
[1901.80] and he shouldn’t have 
gone there at all.
[1914.88] Will you give me some money?
[1919.00] Yes, why not?
[1927.48] I will come. 
Now, where are you going?
[1930.68] I will come back and tell you.
[1938.92] You take care of Areej.
[1941.12] Hey, what?
[1943.36] Where are you going? 
At least tell me and go.
[1947.64] What is the issue?
Both of them are going.
[1951.20] Why is no one telling me anything?
