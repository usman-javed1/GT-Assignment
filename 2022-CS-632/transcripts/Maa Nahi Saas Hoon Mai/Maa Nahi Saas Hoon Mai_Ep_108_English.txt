Yes, Musarrat? Tell me why have you 
called me at this time? I call you all the time, it’s you who don’t pick up. Come to the point,
 I am in office right now. You care so much 
about your business, and me, my son, you don’t care about
 our lives at all, Idrees. I OD so much, 
what else do you want? I want my position, Idrees. I can’t hide and live anymore now. I need my status. You are a second wife 
and that is your status. I didn’t know this is a second marriage, you lied to me. to me, you made me dream about luxury, however, forget about luxury, even my needs are not fulfilled. I do so much already, 
what else do you want? Really? So tell me what
 have you planned regarding your son, his future, our future? There is nothing more in my hands, what else can I give you? Look Idrees, you made me shut up before, but now I won’t stay quiet. Okay, okay, okay, have patience, everything will be fine. How much more 
patience should I have? Idrees, own me else I know very
 well how to take my right. M… This is a hidden marriage that is impossible to proof. You do have the 
marriage certificate. That is because of me too else you used to say what is the need of all this paperwork, this is useless. Okay, I am sorry, forgive me. Okay do one thing, keep this cheque worth 200k and go shop whatever you want, yeah? These are less. So you will get more. Idrees, I am not talking 
about money, I....., I don’t want to keep our 
marriage hidden now. Did Arooj teach you this? First promise me you 
will stay away from her. And no one should find 
out this new address, and you will get a new number too. And in return, I promise you, let me just get this business 
and property once, then I will get rid of Shaista and it will just be me and you. Leave me. Come, let’s go, come. Leave me. Idrees, leave me. Listen, I am still asking you to go away from here. Where should I go? To the same house 
I bought for you, I will come and meet you there. I am present here, meet me here only. Why are you being stubborn? We are spending a good life. We? Not we, just you and your first wife, you have side lined me. I am telling you 
I will fix everything, trust me. Enough! Enough Idrees, I don’t trust your lies and
 false promises anymore now, I need the respect for our 
relationship in this society. So now you have announced, stop now and go. Why should I leave? I won’t go away from here, I am your wife and I want the right of being a wife. Wife? Just keep on living your life quietly else you will have to suffer a lot, you won’t be able to prove
 that we are married. So Mr Idrees, this is your Islamabad? You are living here in Karachi only and I am destroyed in the same city. Idrees, who is this woman? I am asking you, who is she and what 
rubbish is she talking? Idrees doesn’t have
 any other lie to say. I will tell you. I am Idrees’ wife. I am not amongst those wives who will see their 
husband with other woman and will start crying and whining, I have a grown-up son, he will take care of 
all these matters now. Umm Salman? Why are you dragging 
Salman into all this, he has to look after
 a lot of business matters. Why are you panicking? You just said that woman is a liar. Yes, yes, she… So let’s see, Salman is coming
 back from the office. Just pray that woman proves to be a liar. Idrees, own me else I know very 
well how to take my right. I had explained
 everything to Musarrat, she was happy at 
that time but then again the same 
stubborn behavior, her changed behavior
 is making me doubtful that someone is provoking Musarrat. No one is even 
in contact with Musarrat. Yes, but Arooj, but she is fighting
 her own battle right now, she can’t be involved
 in another mission, no. I don’t understand,
 my brain is not working. What is going on? I should inform boss, I should talk to Mr Salman. No, I should tell boss. Boss, do you have time? Nawaz, I am a bit disturbed and worried right now. Yes, I shouldn’t tell you but boss this is very important. What has happened? watch it and tell 
me if it is important or… Tell me what happened? Boss, do you remember a man met an accident
 by Mr Salman’s car? yes, yes, it was 
a very minor accident, Shaista told me. look at this, the guy’s bike came, Mr Salman’s car came and hit it. Here they are having 
a heated argument , and look Madam Arooj comes, lifts her hand to slap 
Mr Salman, and stops. This is the same man who came to meet Mr Salman and Mr Salman refused to meet him. Boss, do you have any idea, how madam Arooj… Delete this video from
 our security computer and from this mobile too, it clearly shows that Salman has on purpose 
tried to hit Shoib with his car. Boss how do you know
 the name of this man? Don’t talk nonsense, delete the video, Salman can get into
 trouble because of this. Boss, it can be deleted from here, but there are CCTV cameras in
 the other buildings in the surrounding. We will think about this, we will think about this too. Go. Okay boss. Taking Areej back 
will cost you a lot. I am not a business 
person like you all that I would calculate 
what costs me a lot or cheaper. I am a mother. if you take Areej from here, you will have to 
suffer a lot of damage. I will divorce you. Do what you want to do, I am not scared of anything now, I will take my daughter from here. I will see how… No, no, son…
What is all this going on? Idrees, Arooj has created this drama, she slapped Salman. Shaista, Salman, you guys go to your room. But she is taking Areej with her. I am telling you to go to your room. Dad, I won’t leave her. Salman, go, go to your room. Okay, come son, come. This is a very special video. Madam Arooj, Mr Salman, at one place, face-to-face. I will have to find out. I have spoken to the 
brother of my friend, he is a lawyer. okay, what did he say? He says that we should only file those cases
 on Salman and his family where we have doubts that Salman and 
Mr Idrees are involved. But your purpose is different. That’s true but the advocate says that for now, we should keep them 
occupied in cases. For example, which case? in the case of an attempt to murder, your car was hit. This is all rubbish. Talk to the point, ask the lawyer to 
not complicate this case. Hmm, you are absolutely right, I will teach them a lesson in court. I wish that God put mercy in their 
hearts before it gets to the court and that they stop doing all this. You are in so much peace, I am not liking it at all. The slap you had 
put across my face, you will find the marks 
of it on your existence. She is my daughter. Salman, my child, sit down. Leave her. And I won’t let you raise her. I am asking you to leave her. Give her to me. Leave her. She is my daughter leave her. My child, you shouldn’t do this. We can sit and talk, come. The time to sit and
 talk has gone. Leave her, I cannot
 live without her. Why can’t you? Didn’t you live
 without your mother? She is my daughter 
she will live with me. You can't do this. Salman, stop, Salman? the guy’s bike came, Mr Salman’s car came and hit it. Here they are having 
a heated argument and look Madam Arooj comes, lifts her hand to slap 
Mr Salman, and stops. This is the same man who came to meet Mr Salman and Mr Salman
 refused to meet him. Boss, do you have any idea, how madam Arooj… Delete this video from 
our security computer and from this mobile too, it clearly shows that Salman has on purpose
 tried to hit Shoaib with his car. Boss how do you know
 the name of this man? Don’t talk nonsense, delete the video, Salman can get into 
trouble because of this. Boss, it can be
 deleted from here, but there are CCTV cameras in
 the other buildings in the surrounding. Salman is such a fool, thank God nothing 
happened to Shoaib else the whole game 
would have been flopped. I don’t know who is 
giving him these foolish advices. Nawaz, immediately
 come to my room, hurry up. Yes, boss? Did you call me? Before deleting that footage, first show it to Salman as to what mistake he has made. But boss, Mr Salman 
is not in the office. Why? Where is he?
 Where did he go? He just gets up and leaves
 at anytime these days, he never tells. okay fine, we cannot wait for Salman, delete it and don’t talk about that 
video in front of anyone. Yes boss. Look son, how she is misbehav… Be careful while talking 
to my mom next time. Look here, you… Salman? Salman? Don’t you have 
any manners to talk? I will throw you out of this house. Salman? Salman? No. Leave me, Dad. No, no. Why are you stopping him? What will you do to me? Yeah? Why did you stop? What do you think I will get scared of all this. I am not scared of anyone, listen to this very carefully. Shut up! I will just throw you out of here. This is mine and 
my mother’s house, one can throw us out of here, do you guys understand? Listen to this very carefully. This is mine and
 my mother’s house. Salman, this cannot be expected 
from an educated boy like you. What happened? Why are you getting so angry? You shut up, why didn’t you tell
 me his car met an accident? I did tell you. Don’t act smart, you did not tell me 
who did it happen with and I am sure you
 knew it as well. Will you keep on getting angry or will you even tell what’s wrong? You hit Master Shoaib with your car. Who told you? The CCTV footage. It is clearly shown in the CCTV 
cameras of our company that you have made an attempt 
to murder Shoaib with your car. Tell me, will there be a problem? Not yet but if someone gets this video, the career of business tycoon
 Salman will be destroyed. So then do one thing, get that footage deleted. I have but what should 
I do about the cameras of the... ... other companies that 
are installed there? please do something. Both of you do something since you both are very smart. I even asked you 
guys to do as I say but you guys were in a rush. What you were doing 
wouldn’t even kill the target and break the stick. Now do as I say, don’t even think of 
doing anything more, both of you. He got away again. Who? The same, Master Shoaib, he came to my office today, I hit his bike with my car. Then? Then what? The old man survived. Salman, what are you doing son? Don’t do all this, you will get in trouble by all this. For God’s sake, Mom, it was a minor accident, what else? And by the way, I am just fed up of this family, I won’t be at peace till I kill all of them. What should I do Nasir? I cannot tolerate it. You are the limit, Salman, despite knowing 
everything, you did this. No matter what you say, it is an attempt to murder. So what else would I do? I hate anyone 
who disrupts my life. You have mentally become numb, the decision-making power
 weakens in this situation. So the you tell me what should I do? Ask this to yourself. Keep hate and emotions aside, and then look for an answer and then accept that answer. You easily said it, but it is very difficult to do it. You find it difficult, right? Then opt for an easy way, keep on making a mistake
 and destroy yourself. I know you, I know you very well, you are very stubborn. You will do what you want to do, then go and continue doing it, it doesn’t make any
 difference to me, okay? bye. Tea. These court matters, how will they work, have you thought of it? What do you mean
 by how will it work? They say if you want to go
 the court and hospital, you shouldn’t take 
money in pockets but shopping bags. Now where will we get 
so much money from, Master? God will create a way. God make every way, now you have such little pension, our family members
 have increased too, 3 people have increased. Why 3? Areej is very little right now. Areej’s expenses are the highest. Her milk is very expensive, a Rs 5000 packet ends in 5 days.
