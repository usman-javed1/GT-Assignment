Good Morning Sir. Good Morning. Good Morning. Good Morning. What brings you here? Yes I thought I should visit your office before 
going to mine. That’s great, so you must come here first and then go to your office daily. Daily? No, I cannot come daily. why? I cannot come daily because if I start coming here daily, then your staff will 
get friendly with me and that’s against
 business protocol. Okay so you think we shouldn’t get friendly 
with staff? No, we should, in fact we should also 
take care of them but the gap between a boss and 
the staff is very important. That protocol is a must. Good Morning sir. Good Morning. Good Morning. Do you know the entire plan for 
overheads is designed by Ammad and now that we are thinking 
of giving loan to the staff of the office, that plan is being 
designed by him too. In fact, let me do one thing, I will share the plan with you 
and let’s set a meeting one day. We will talk about it, for now, I am getting late so I’ll see you at night. Okay. Yes Mr Sarim, it is like that, we have been working with 
your company for so long and we have never gotten 
any complaint from your side. Thank you so much, madam. But Mr. Sarim, we haven’t gotten supply
 from you this month. I didn’t get it, madam, the entire supply has been 
sent from our end. Mr. Sarim, Stone Berry’s 1000 sq ft supply
 has not been received yet. I have the copy of 
receipt with me, I will email it to you. So, you mean to say that you have already 
delivered the marble? If you sent the supply, 
do one thing send us the location 
of delivery point. Okay I will send you 
the location pin. And Ammad will email you
 the rest of the details. Yes. Okay Mr. Sarim, can we meet you today? Okay ma’am, I will come, any issue? No actually need to discuss some 
further projects with you so I thought we should
 meet today. Okay ma’am, bye. All right, thank you, thank you so much. What happened? Is everything all right? Boss, Madam is having a meeting 
with Stone Berry at her office. We have made full payment, they
 don’t have any issue with us. But I guess you are forgetting 
that Madam Arooj has issues with us. If the question about the marble
 not being delivered is raised, what will we tell? Arooj’s wish will be buried, nothing will happen. Boss, are you doing something
 on the inside that I am not aware of? There is no need for you
 to know everything. But I should know about this if you get caught 
I will be doomed. You won’t be doomed. I have hit a very 
sensitive spot this time, Ammad will leave and Arooj’s office will be closed too. Nothing will happen. Okay boss. What did you feel? What did you see? That she defends 
and favors that boy. So how does it prove that she is frank with Ammad. Shaista they are, So, what’s wrong, they have known each
 other for a very long, they are friends with each other. You don’t know, Shaista, but we do know Arooj, it is the limit Idrees. Hey you are not looking 
at it like I am. You don’t look at 
it that way too, if you will look for the truth 
according to your wish, it will be bad. Arooj? Is there something
 to worry about? Yes, there are a lot of things
 to worry about. If Salman hadn't made
 this huge empire, even after so much corruption company’s survival would 
have been very difficult. Such people do exist. When they see billions
 of rupees rolling, taking out millions is not 
a problem for them and most of the corruption
 takes place there. And that is the reason the company’s financial 
strength weakens. Exactly. Let me just find out where the marble
 has been delivered, I will reveal those people. umm, Arooj? Hmm?
The location has been shared. Where is this location? Umm, somewhere 
I think in DHA But what is the exact location? It is showing some residential area. Residential Area? But as far as I know, we don’t have an office 
on such locations. Oh! So it means that marble has been supplied, the stock has been taken
 out from this company and delivered to that location. Hmm. I think the same. Okay then, go and check on this
 location who is it, and who has accepted 
the marble delivery. okay I will do one thing, let me go to the location and get all the information. tell me if that boy is important for the 
company or Arooj? Yes, that is what I am saying, Arooj is the boss, there is a distance between 
an employee and the boss. Yes, and that’s how it is If that’s how it is then 
why can’t I see it? I see something else. What do you see? Look Salman, I don’t want to see you worried. Mom, I am not worried,
 I have no worries. you are not right now, but you will be in the future. If this happens with consignments
 outside the company, the articles are ordered in bulk, then when the 
projects get closed, they can sell the article
 to other people. Stone worth 65 lac was ordered, there must be some payment, 
some receipt, something must be there. It means that the place where this happened, they even don’t need 
the receipt, it means both parties 
are equally involved. excuse me, is Salman there? Yes. Sir, may I come in? Come in. when someone sit with their 
chair turned the other way, the intelligent people says that 
they are thinking something. Why are you sitting 
quietly like this? If you don’t like my face,
 I can leave. Shut up. Have a seat. Tell me something? What is the foundation of doubt? Foundation of doubt? A misunderstanding, where you unaware of the truth. And is their truth in doubt? What also happens is, 
you start feeling its true but with partial trust, there comes doubt. By the way why are you asking all this? Nothing. Tell me will you have tea or coffee? I will have coffee and leave, I have very important work. Hello, send 2 cups of coffee. Thank you. what happened why is your mood off? You didn’t even have dinner. I had it outside. Was it a business dinner? No. So then why did you eat out? We could have eaten together, what is that? you don’t have to think about it. What did you say? I don’t have to think about it. Then you tell me what 
should I think about? I don’t have any answers
 to your questions. How do you not have any 
answers to my questions? I am sleepy. Switch off the light. Madam Sr? Did Salman go to office. no not yet. Okay ask him to meet me 
before leaving. Okay. Here is Sir Jr. You may go. Okay. Come, Salman sit, I need to talk about something 
important to you. Mom, is it something important? I have to go for a meeting. I need to talk about something 
very important too. Yes, tell me? you know how important you and 
your life matters are to me? What is it, mom? I gave you an advice, you didn’t concentrate on it. Mom, what advice are you talking about? You know I concentrate a lot 
on whatever you advise me. Then what did you do about that guy? His friendly behavior with your wife how do you bear it? What happened? Did you feel bad? You should. But Salman, just feeling bad won’t help, son. Until when will you tolerate 
Arooj’s pointless wishes? I am afraid one of her wishes 
will come stand in front of you. Mom you are thinking 
very negatively on this issue. I don’t think like that. Okay, you confessed at least 
that this is an issue. I am getting very late, I must leave. Come. This is my madam Jr. greetings madam. Greetings. Who is this? This is my husband, Allah Ditta. Madam, I am here to thank you, you got me treated and 
helped me get off drugs, you have done me a huge favor, I will never forget your favor, trust me I don’t do 
drugs at all now. That’s great, you will work hard now and won’t bother Wasai at all. Yes. Wasai is very nice and madam you are very nice too. May God never give
 you any sorrow and always keep you happy. Madam Jr I remember
 you promised me, you said, Wasai, I am with you, you fulfilled your promise, thank you so much. No problem. Okay I will escort him to the gate. Okay. Come. Do you know the entire plan for overheads
 is designed by Ammad and now that we are thinking of 
giving loan to the staff of the office, that plan is being
 designed by him too. Sir, everything is perfect. Sir, how wouldn’t 
I be comfortable, I guess you don’t know 
we were classmates. Yes sir? Send the IT manager to me. Okay sir. Salman sir is calling you. May I come in sir? Come in. Yes sir? I need access to the CCTV 
of the finance department. Of this office? Are you mad? Sorry sir. Who is here? I am talking about home, 
the office at home. Okay sir I will give it to you. It is done. You may go. Coffee? Umm, thank you by the way, I really felt like having coffee. Now I don’t know how is it, just have it no matter how is it. Really? His friendly behavior with your 
wife how do you bear it? just feeling bad won’t help, son. Until when will you tolerate 
Arooj’s pointless wishes? I am afraid one of her wishes 
will come stand in front of you. And tell me, did you find out about 
the 65 lacs marble? Yes, I went there but 
a family lives there. Off course, a family would be living there but my question to you is that which employee from our company
 sold the marbles to that family? Arooj, when I went there, the gate keeper said 
that sir is not home but I am sure, it is not done by any employee, company’s owners are 
definitely involved. I know where are you hinting. Uncle, right? I guess. I am 100% sure and I will get you the proof one day. Well let’s see, we shall see. You will see. By the way, coffee is actually very good. Thank you once again. I just have one thing in 
my mind right now, that this 65 lacs.. I am I am so sorry. It’s okay. So, I was saying I need to 
sort this mystery of 65 lacs because only then we will find
 out who is behind all this. Thank you Wasai. Okay Wasai, you may go. Yes, brother Idrees, now tell me what is it? Look Mehreen I understand 
that Salman is your beloved, only children are beloved. Even I love him a lot I have 
always loved him all my life but I think I will have to talk
 to Salman strictly at this age which I have never done before. Brother Idrees, what did your nephew 
Salman do now? That is the thing, nephew 
didn’t do anything. After all what has happened?
 Brother Idrees? Nothing, but I cannot tolerate 
this that our daughter… Arooj, first correct yourself, 
brother Idrees, she is not our daughter just daughter-in-law. Yes, okay, okay she is our 
daughter-in-law but being Salman’s wife,
 she is the honor of this house. Now if she does all this stuff, I admit we give freedom 
but that doesn’t mean.. Okay I have told everything 
to Salman he will fix Arooj himself, please don’t fight with him, after all Salman is our own. I know that. Have tea. Okay. Okay, you confessed at least
 that this is an issue. Foundation of doubt? A misunderstanding, where you unaware of the truth. What also happens is, 
you start feeling its true but with partial trust, there comes doubt. What are you looking at? You must see too
 sister-in-law Shaista. What is special about 
what you are seeing? I am watching how this girl is betraying my son. Betraying, what do you mean? You know how innocent my Salman is? If my Salman has made the
 mistake of liking this girl, she should also stay 
loyal to her husband. What did Arooj do now that you are questioning
 her loyalty. Sister-in-law Shaista, 
you are very simple, see it for yourself. So what? What does this have to do with 
love for Salman and loyalty? You are right. This girl has no connection 
with all this, their frankness is telling this. frankness? Oh my God Mehreen 
you think so negatively. They are both University mates and 
work together now, big deal? Okay no big deal, Arooj is the boss, she is standing and that boy is an 
employee he is sitting. What should I name all this? You won’t name it anything, especially in front of Salman. Look at me begging you, please! Hey why did you come? I was coming with the tax file. you must have taken out 
the file from the record then went to the car 
then went home, I saved your time. You are saying all 
this step by step like tax record is kept 
in another city. you took very long in
 bringing he file already now you may go your mom 
must be waiting for you. Yes, yes, I am going, 
I am going, and my mom doesn’t eat
 without me anyway, I guess because of loneliness. Why don’t you get married? Aunt will get a good 
company at home and you will get serious in life too. Yeah, actually marriage is the only way that makes every 
kind of person very serious in life. You are saying this for 
Salman, right? I know. Greetings. Greetings. Hello.
