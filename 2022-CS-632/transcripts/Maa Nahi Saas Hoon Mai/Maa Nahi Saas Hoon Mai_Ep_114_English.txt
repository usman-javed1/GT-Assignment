Are you fine? I am fine, child. Don’t worry. I will talk to them. Madam, what are you doing here? Why did you bring him here? He is my father. Madam, this is the police station. We only bring the ones 
who are criminals here. Really? What has he done? 
What is his crime? You ask this from the inspector. Papa, I will do something.
 Don’t worry. Okay, child. A decent man like master, 
and the police? The whole neighbourhood knows that he never even 
mistreated an animal. Why are you thinking 
this sister Naseema? We all know, the entire neighbourhood knows that
 the police took master without any fault. Salman and Idrees are getting 
all this done, to show their power. They want to scare us, 
so that we become weak. Sister Mehreen, so why are they doing 
this with us? We stay at home, then why are they doing this
injustice with us. They are here. Thank God you people have come. Arooj, are Salman and Idrees getting 
all this done? Yes. Those people say that papa has kept Areej 
against her will. Why are those people doing this? Because we deserve this,
 that’s why. What are you saying? I am right, mama. If the beast within a person is
 unleashed, people like us, who are timid, 
cannot confront it. If we sit scared and timid like this, 
frightened like a criminal, these people won’t let us live. Child, we are decent people. Decency is our asset. That is the issue with us decent 
and respectable people, papa. If a modest person steps back 
from a person, then the immodest person feels
 they are cowards. And do you know? Not raising your voice for your rights
is also a great ingratitude to God. I have decided, I will stand up for my right. And now, I will not listen 
to anyone of you. Arooj. What is the matter? How did you people come inside? This is a home of decent people,
 inspector. At least you people should seek 
permission before coming. We know well how decent 
you people are. Come with us to the police station. But why? What have I done? What is my fault? You will find out your fault 
when you go to the police station. Where are you taking him? 
Leave him. Show me the warrant, first. 
Leave him. What are you doing?
What are you doing? You are taking him for no reason.
 Why? Sister Mehreen. Sister Naseema, you first go 
call Arooj. But… You go and call Arooj. 
I will see. You go ahead. You are really comfortable, right? I don’t like it at all. You will find the marks of the slap 
you hit me on my face on your existence. She is my daughter. Salman what are you doing?
I said leave her. I will not let you bring her up. 
Leave her, I say. Leave her… She is my daughter and I will not let you bring her up. Salman, don’t do that. We will sit and talk. 
Come on. The time to sit and 
talk has passed. Leave her, I cannot live without her. Why can you not live without her? Did you not live without your mother? This is my daughter, 
she will live with me. You cannot do this. 
Salman, stop. Salman. Is all okay? Why are you walking like that? I am fine. I am fine. Where did you go? I went to meet Salman. To meet Salman? Why? To talk on your issue. I told him to save his home 
from getting ruined. Then? What did he say, then? He cursed me and made me fall 
by pushing me down. You cannot take Areej. You cannot keep a mother 
away from her daughter. I will stop you. 
Leave me. Leave my hand. 
I won’t leave it. Leave my hand… Arooj how dare you raise your hand 
at my son? A mother raised her hand 
for her daughter. But when will you understand this? If you take Areej from here, 
then I will kill you. No, no, Salman don’t do this. Stop them, Salman. 
Hey, where are you taking it? Salman. Stop them, Salman. Where are they taking my bike? Salman. Salman, 
don’t do this. Look… What happened? Why did you stop? Hit me. I would have surely slapped you, if the mark of the slap from last night 
not left your face. Why did you come here? 
And I knew you would do this. That’s why I followed you 
and came here. Who asked you to come here? Child, I wanted to talk to Salman. Papa. Papa. Look, you are decent people. I think that you let this matter go. All this is not something 
you people can deal with and you know this really well 
who did all this. If you still want to hear it from me,
 then hear it. This has been done by 
Mr. Idrees and his nephew, in fact, he turned out to be his son. Anyway, they did all this. Look madam, they are 
really powerful people and my advice to you is that you don’t mess with them. Look, whatever the matter is, 
end it or they will ruin your life. This is not that easy. It costs a lot of money. 
It takes a lot of time. Neither do we have money, nor does Arooj have time. You are right Master. Arooj also comes really late
from her job. Now you tell me, are we capable of filing a case? We are not, papa. We surely, are not. But, are we so weak that we cannot even protest? You have taught me papa. If accepting injustice becomes fate, even then, it is necessary to protest. Is this what you taught me 
through your upbringing? Weren’t these the brave things 
you used to say to me? Then have faith in your daughter. Sister in law, Salman is a really 
old friend of mine. In fact, you can say he was an old friend. But I couldn’t even imagine Salman
would have such thinking. Brother Nasir, if Salman has enmity with me, he should attack me. Why is he humiliating my family? Till today, I had decided, I would 
stay quiet, I won’t say anything. But now I have decided, I will not stay quiet at all. Sister in law, I am not even 1% surprised
 at anything that you are saying. You are thinking correctly. Sister in law, I would just want to say, if you need anything or anything is worrying you, then your brother is standing with you. Thank you so much brother Nasir. You gave me a post in the company, you helped me so much, I…
Sister in law, please, you deserved this job. I didn’t do any favours on you. I have found out from 
the management that Salman has ended all his tenders. Is this true? Yes. Unfortunately, that’s how 
it is sister in law. and all this is happening 
because of me. Brother Nasir, you know 70% tenders of this company 
are Salman’s and if these tenders end,
then the company will end. Why are making a deal in loss 
because of me? Sister in law, what you see as loss, it is actually not loss and believe me, 
I am satisfied in my heart that at least I didn’t snatch 
anyone’s right. And sister in law, 
tenders come and go. You don’t worry at all.
