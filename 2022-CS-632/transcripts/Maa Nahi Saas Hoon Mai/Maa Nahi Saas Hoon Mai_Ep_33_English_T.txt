[27.96] Good Morning Sir.
[29.24] Good Morning.
[35.24] Good Morning.
[36.16] Good Morning.
[37.32] What brings you here?
[39.32] Yes I thought I should
[40.84] visit your office before 
going to mine.
[43.48] That’s great,
[45.20] so you must come here first
[47.12] and then go to your office daily.
[52.40] Daily? No, I cannot come daily.
[55.80] why?
[56.64] I cannot come daily
[58.24] because if I start coming here daily,
[60.04] then your staff will 
get friendly with me
[64.36] and that’s against
 business protocol.
[68.36] Okay
[69.68] so you think
[72.04] we shouldn’t get friendly 
with staff?
[75.80] No, we should,
[78.52] in fact we should also 
take care of them
[82.04] but the gap between a boss and 
the staff is very important.
[87.20] That protocol is a must.
[94.12] Good Morning sir.
[95.36] Good Morning.
[96.16] Good Morning.
[97.40] Do you know the entire plan for 
overheads is designed by Ammad
[103.60] and now that we are thinking 
of giving loan to the staff of the office,
[106.80] that plan is being 
designed by him too.
[113.00] In fact, let me do one thing,
[114.56] I will share the plan with you 
and let’s set a meeting one day.
[118.68] We will talk about it,
[121.12] for now, I am getting late
[122.28] so I’ll see you at night.
[124.36] Okay.
[147.68] Yes Mr Sarim, it is like that,
[150.80] we have been working with 
your company for so long
[153.76] and we have never gotten 
any complaint from your side.
[157.60] Thank you so much, madam.
[160.12] But Mr. Sarim,
[161.56] we haven’t gotten supply
 from you this month.
[164.52] I didn’t get it, madam,
[165.72] the entire supply has been 
sent from our end.
[170.28] Mr. Sarim,
[171.72] Stone Berry’s 1000 sq ft supply
 has not been received yet.
[177.40] I have the copy of 
receipt with me,
[179.00] I will email it to you.
[185.60] So, you mean to say that
[188.60] you have already 
delivered the marble?
[193.28] If you sent the supply, 
do one thing
[196.80] send us the location 
of delivery point.
[201.20] Okay I will send you 
the location pin.
[203.96] And Ammad will email you
 the rest of the details.
[211.28] Yes.
[212.04] Okay Mr. Sarim,
[214.04] can we meet you today?
[216.48] Okay ma’am,
[217.28] I will come, any issue?
[219.36] No actually need to discuss some 
further projects with you
[223.16] so I thought we should
 meet today.
[227.04] Okay ma’am, bye.
[228.92] All right, thank you,
[230.52] thank you so much.
[249.40] What happened?
[250.00] Is everything all right?
[251.12] Boss, Madam is having a meeting 
with Stone Berry at her office.
[256.48] We have made full payment, they
 don’t have any issue with us.
[259.36] But I guess you are forgetting 
that Madam Arooj has issues with us.
[265.12] If the question about the marble
 not being delivered is raised,
[266.96] what will we tell?
[269.80] Arooj’s wish will be buried,
[272.08] nothing will happen.
[273.20] Boss, are you doing something
 on the inside
[275.24] that I am not aware of?
[277.44] There is no need for you
 to know everything.
[280.76] But I should know about this
[282.48] if you get caught 
I will be doomed.
[284.52] You won’t be doomed.
[289.48] I have hit a very 
sensitive spot this time,
[292.60] Ammad will leave and
[294.40] Arooj’s office will be closed too.
[296.20] Nothing will happen.
[298.40] Okay boss.
[315.60] What did you feel?
[317.16] What did you see?
[319.04] That she defends 
and favors that boy.
[323.04] So how does it prove that
[325.16] she is frank with Ammad.
[328.16] Shaista they are,
[330.72] So, what’s wrong,
[332.60] they have known each
 other for a very long,
[336.12] they are friends with each other.
[338.36] You don’t know, Shaista,
[339.84] but we do know Arooj,
[342.36] it is the limit Idrees.
[345.88] Hey you are not looking 
at it like I am.
[348.20] You don’t look at 
it that way too,
[350.16] if you will look for the truth 
according to your wish,
[353.08] it will be bad.
[373.68] Arooj?
[377.52] Is there something
 to worry about?
[379.56] Yes,
[382.36] there are a lot of things
 to worry about.
[388.76] If Salman hadn't made
 this huge empire,
[393.44] even after so much corruption
[396.28] company’s survival would 
have been very difficult.
[399.24] Such people do exist.
[401.12] When they see billions
 of rupees rolling,
[405.80] taking out millions is not 
a problem for them
[409.04] and most of the corruption
 takes place there.
[412.20] And that is the reason
[413.92] the company’s financial 
strength weakens.
[417.20] Exactly.
[420.36] Let me just find out where the marble
 has been delivered,
[424.92] I will reveal those people.
[436.32] umm, Arooj?
[437.72] Hmm?
The location has been shared.
[440.52] Where is this location?
[441.96] Umm, somewhere 
I think in DHA
[447.16] But what is the exact location?
[449.80] It is showing some residential area.
[453.20] Residential Area?
[455.80] But as far as I know,
[459.00] we don’t have an office 
on such locations.
[465.56] Oh!
[467.28] So it means that
[469.24] marble has been supplied,
[473.00] the stock has been taken
 out from this company
[475.72] and delivered to that location.
[477.80] Hmm.
[479.08] I think the same.
[481.84] Okay then,
[482.88] go and check on this
 location who is it,
[486.36] and who has accepted 
the marble delivery.
[490.72] okay I will do one thing,
[492.68] let me go to the location and
[494.16] get all the information.
[517.24] tell me if that boy
[519.20] is important for the 
company or Arooj?
[590.60] Yes,
[591.76] that is what I am saying,
[593.64] Arooj is the boss,
[595.72] there is a distance between 
an employee and the boss.
[598.96] Yes, and that’s how it is
[600.40] If that’s how it is then 
why can’t I see it?
[602.24] I see something else.
[603.40] What do you see?
[605.76] Look Salman,
[607.36] I don’t want to see you worried.
[609.36] Mom, I am not worried,
 I have no worries.
[611.92] you are not right now,
[613.12] but you will be in the future.
[661.40] If this happens with consignments
 outside the company,
[667.12] the articles are ordered in bulk,
[677.92] then when the 
projects get closed,
[682.60] they can sell the article
 to other people.
[689.36] Stone worth 65 lac was ordered,
[696.96] there must be some payment, 
some receipt,
[701.68] something must be there.
[715.00] It means that
[719.08] the place where this happened,
[725.20] they even don’t need 
the receipt,
[730.24] it means both parties 
are equally involved.
[744.32] excuse me, is Salman there?
[746.12] Yes.
[754.48] Sir, may I come in?
[761.16] Come in.
[770.92] when someone sit with their 
chair turned the other way,
[773.76] the intelligent people says that 
they are thinking something.
[780.20] Why are you sitting 
quietly like this?
[785.40] If you don’t like my face,
 I can leave.
[787.88] Shut up.
[790.48] Have a seat.
[801.08] Tell me something?
[806.56] What is the foundation of doubt?
[808.68] Foundation of doubt?
[813.52] A misunderstanding,
[815.28] where you unaware of the truth.
[820.12] And is their truth in doubt?
[825.56] What also happens is, 
you start feeling its true
[828.12] but with partial trust,
[831.20] there comes doubt.
[837.24] By the way
[838.80] why are you asking all this?
[842.16] Nothing.
[844.20] Tell me will you have tea or coffee?
[848.80] I will have coffee and leave,
[849.88] I have very important work.
[862.20] Hello,
[864.24] send 2 cups of coffee.
[866.60] Thank you.
[913.68] what happened why is your mood off?
[916.56] You didn’t even have dinner.
[920.24] I had it outside.
[923.72] Was it a business dinner?
[927.12] No.
[931.20] So then why did you eat out?
[933.84] We could have eaten together,
[936.32] what is that?
[939.40] you don’t have to think about it.
[942.84] What did you say?
[944.76] I don’t have to think about it.
[948.00] Then you tell me what 
should I think about?
[951.04] I don’t have any answers
 to your questions.
[955.72] How do you not have any 
answers to my questions?
[961.28] I am sleepy.
[967.80] Switch off the light.
[1012.44] Madam Sr?
[1015.32] Did Salman go to office.
[1017.00] no not yet.
[1019.16] Okay
[1020.16] ask him to meet me 
before leaving.
[1022.96] Okay.
[1025.36] Here is Sir Jr.
[1028.56] You may go.
[1029.48] Okay.
[1030.64] Come, Salman sit,
[1031.84] I need to talk about something 
important to you.
[1034.36] Mom, is it something important?
[1035.56] I have to go for a meeting.
[1038.44] I need to talk about something 
very important too.
[1045.72] Yes, tell me?
[1046.96] you know how important you and 
your life matters are to me?
[1055.88] What is it, mom?
[1058.08] I gave you an advice,
[1063.20] you didn’t concentrate on it.
[1066.40] Mom,
[1067.44] what advice are you talking about?
[1073.52] You know I concentrate a lot 
on whatever you advise me.
[1079.68] Then what did you do about that guy?
[1087.08] His friendly behavior with your wife
[1091.12] how do you bear it?
[1101.40] What happened?
[1103.16] Did you feel bad?
[1105.52] You should.
[1110.40] But Salman,
[1112.28] just feeling bad won’t help, son.
[1120.64] Until when will you tolerate 
Arooj’s pointless wishes?
[1129.84] I am afraid one of her wishes 
will come stand in front of you.
[1139.68] Mom you are thinking 
very negatively on this issue.
[1146.12] I don’t think like that.
[1148.88] Okay,
[1151.32] you confessed at least 
that this is an issue.
[1157.92] I am getting very late,
[1159.68] I must leave.
[1206.00] Come.
[1208.28] This is my madam Jr.
[1210.68] greetings madam.
[1212.32] Greetings. Who is this?
[1216.04] This is my husband, Allah Ditta.
[1222.84] Madam, I am here to thank you,
[1225.52] you got me treated and 
helped me get off drugs,
[1228.52] you have done me a huge favor,
[1230.68] I will never forget your favor,
[1233.36] trust me I don’t do 
drugs at all now.
[1236.76] That’s great,
[1238.52] you will work hard now
[1239.76] and won’t bother Wasai at all.
[1242.56] Yes.
[1243.44] Wasai is very nice
[1245.12] and madam you are very nice too.
[1247.64] May God never give
 you any sorrow
[1249.76] and always keep you happy.
[1253.16] Madam Jr I remember
 you promised me,
[1263.12] you said, Wasai,
[1265.56] I am with you,
[1268.96] you fulfilled your promise,
[1273.24] thank you so much.
[1275.08] No problem.
[1276.64] Okay
[1277.64] I will escort him to the gate.
[1279.76] Okay.
[1280.60] Come.
[1340.44] Do you know
[1341.72] the entire plan for overheads
 is designed by Ammad
[1346.60] and now that we are thinking of 
giving loan to the staff of the office,
[1349.80] that plan is being
 designed by him too.
[1357.60] Sir, everything is perfect.
[1360.76] Sir, how wouldn’t 
I be comfortable,
[1362.96] I guess you don’t know 
we were classmates.
[1375.12] Yes sir?
[1376.28] Send the IT manager to me.
[1378.08] Okay sir.
[1387.08] Salman sir is calling you.
[1412.28] May I come in sir?
[1414.16] Come in.
[1416.76] Yes sir?
[1424.64] I need access to the CCTV 
of the finance department.
[1428.60] Of this office?
[1430.96] Are you mad?
[1432.76] Sorry sir.
[1433.96] Who is here?
[1436.60] I am talking about home, 
the office at home.
[1438.64] Okay sir I will give it to you.
[1457.60] It is done.
[1464.28] You may go.
[1478.56] Coffee?
[1479.20] Umm, thank you
[1481.56] by the way,
[1482.56] I really felt like having coffee.
[1485.00] Now I don’t know how is it,
[1488.48] just have it no matter how is it.
[1491.24] Really?
[1543.92] His friendly behavior with your 
wife how do you bear it?
[1550.80] just feeling bad won’t help, son.
[1554.28] Until when will you tolerate 
Arooj’s pointless wishes?
[1559.24] I am afraid one of her wishes 
will come stand in front of you.
[1604.20] And tell me,
[1608.24] did you find out about 
the 65 lacs marble?
[1614.40] Yes, I went there but 
a family lives there.
[1620.36] Off course,
[1622.72] a family would be living there
[1625.96] but my question to you is that
[1630.76] which employee from our company
 sold the marbles to that family?
[1638.44] Arooj,
[1641.40] when I went there,
[1642.96] the gate keeper said 
that sir is not home
[1647.12] but I am sure,
[1648.84] it is not done by any employee,
[1651.00] company’s owners are 
definitely involved.
[1657.00] I know where are you hinting.
[1663.20] Uncle, right?
[1664.96] I guess.
[1667.00] I am 100% sure
[1669.16] and I will get you the proof one day.
[1673.40] Well let’s see, we shall see.
[1677.00] You will see.
[1679.36] By the way,
[1682.88] coffee is actually very good.
[1684.80] Thank you once again.
[1687.08] I just have one thing in 
my mind right now,
[1689.88] that this 65 lacs..
[1693.80] I am I am so sorry.
[1695.72] It’s okay.
[1704.32] So, I was saying I need to 
sort this mystery of 65 lacs
[1708.88] because only then we will find
 out who is behind all this.
[1722.00] Thank you Wasai.
[1724.64] Okay Wasai, you may go.
[1733.60] Yes, brother Idrees,
[1735.36] now tell me what is it?
[1737.12] Look Mehreen I understand 
that Salman is your beloved,
[1739.76] only children are beloved.
[1742.80] Even I love him a lot I have 
always loved him all my life
[1746.04] but I think I will have to talk
 to Salman strictly at this age
[1749.00] which I have never done before.
[1752.12] Brother Idrees,
[1753.60] what did your nephew 
Salman do now?
[1756.64] That is the thing, nephew 
didn’t do anything.
[1759.76] After all what has happened?
 Brother Idrees?
[1761.88] Nothing,
[1762.76] but I cannot tolerate 
this that our daughter…
[1765.12] Arooj,
[1769.08] first correct yourself, 
brother Idrees,
[1774.80] she is not our daughter
[1776.40] just daughter-in-law.
[1777.96] Yes, okay, okay she is our 
daughter-in-law but
[1779.88] being Salman’s wife,
 she is the honor of this house.
[1784.80] Now if she does all this stuff,
[1786.88] I admit we give freedom 
but that doesn’t mean..
[1789.36] Okay I have told everything 
to Salman
[1792.36] he will fix Arooj himself,
[1796.72] please don’t fight with him,
[1799.16] after all Salman is our own.
[1803.40] I know that.
[1807.20] Have tea.
[1811.28] Okay.
[1862.40] Okay,
[1865.00] you confessed at least
 that this is an issue.
[1893.24] Foundation of doubt?
[1898.04] A misunderstanding,
[1899.76] where you unaware of the truth.
[1902.52] What also happens is, 
you start feeling its true
[1905.00] but with partial trust,
[1908.16] there comes doubt.
[1988.68] What are you looking at?
[1991.24] You must see too
 sister-in-law Shaista.
[1995.68] What is special about 
what you are seeing?
[1998.84] I am watching
[2001.56] how this girl is betraying my son.
[2014.44] Betraying, what do you mean?
[2017.24] You know
[2019.80] how innocent my Salman is?
[2026.28] If my Salman has made the
 mistake of liking this girl,
[2031.12] she should also stay 
loyal to her husband.
[2037.40] What did Arooj do now
[2039.68] that you are questioning
 her loyalty.
[2044.16] Sister-in-law Shaista, 
you are very simple,
[2047.24] see it for yourself.
[2056.08] So what?
[2058.12] What does this have to do with 
love for Salman and loyalty?
[2061.36] You are right.
[2063.92] This girl has no connection 
with all this,
[2073.12] their frankness is telling this.
[2076.68] frankness?
[2078.40] Oh my God Mehreen 
you think so negatively.
[2085.40] They are both University mates and 
work together now, big deal?
[2088.84] Okay no big deal,
[2092.68] Arooj is the boss,
[2095.52] she is standing
[2098.60] and that boy is an 
employee he is sitting.
[2114.32] What should I name all this?
[2116.92] You won’t name it anything,
[2118.92] especially in front of Salman.
[2127.60] Look at me begging you, please!
[2190.64] Hey why did you come?
[2192.28] I was coming with the tax file.
[2194.48] you must have taken out 
the file from the record
[2196.08] then went to the car 
then went home,
[2198.92] I saved your time.
[2200.36] You are saying all 
this step by step
[2202.32] like tax record is kept 
in another city.
[2206.12] you took very long in
 bringing he file already
[2208.24] now you may go your mom 
must be waiting for you.
[2211.04] Yes, yes, I am going, 
I am going,
[2214.04] and my mom doesn’t eat
 without me anyway,
[2222.92] I guess because of loneliness.
[2227.04] Why don’t you get married?
[2234.40] Aunt will get a good 
company at home and
[2238.28] you will get serious in life too.
[2241.72] Yeah, actually
[2243.56] marriage is the only
[2245.20] way that makes every 
kind of person
[2247.00] very serious in life.
[2249.32] You are saying this for 
Salman, right?
[2251.08] I know.
[2261.72] Greetings.
[2266.40] Greetings.
[2271.08] Hello.
