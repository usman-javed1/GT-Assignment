She was trying to stay
awake for no reason to prove her love for Salman. I am his mother, I couldn’t even sleep for a moment. Aunt Shaista? Aunt Shaista? Aunt, she is sweating and her body is all cold. Aunt Shaista? I will go get the doctor. Sister-in-law? Sister-in-law? What happened to her? What should we do? Should I look after Salman or her? What the hell? What the hell? Where is Urooj gone? Looks like she is going to stay
with sister-in-law Shaista. I don’t know, when she didn’t have
the stamina to stay awake then why did she stay here? She doesn’t listen to anyone. Her blood pressure got
dangerously low But she was absolutely fine, what happened to
her all of a sudden? It often happens
when you don’t sleep, there is nothing to worry about, you may take her home
when this drip ends. Okay, fine, thank you. Excuse me. Where is sister-in-law Shaista? She is on a drip. Drip? But why? Her blood pressure got low
due to staying awake. What was the need for
her to stay awake when she didn’t have
the stamina? We just need attendants
in the hospital, not patients. But aunt, she is absolutely fine now. Do one thing, call brother Idrees and
ask him to take his wife away. No, I don’t think that is needed, she feels well. Will we take care of Salman
or sister-in-law Shaista, call brother Idrees? What should I do? She is after me. Let me make a fake call. Uncle Idrees’ number
is not going through. His number is not going through? Let me check myself. Greetings, brother Idrees, sister-in-law Shaista has gotten unwell, she is here in the emergency,
just come immediately. Yes. Bye. Hmph, I am Salman’s mother and she wanted to be like me. Did you see her love now, it’s like the paper flowers. Shaista, what happened? I don’t know, my blood pressure got low. Sister-in-law scared me. How are you, sister-in-law? I am fine. Brother Idrees, she is very weak, you must take her home. No, no, I will stay here with Salman. You are a patient yourself, we need healthy people here. You must go home. Yes Shaista, let’s go home. Mehreen was constantly
hitting me with sarcasm, she pushed me out of the hospital
and then got peace. You know that is how she is. Her brain works very well when
she has to make some scheme else, she is mentally weak. She can think of anything
when it comes to Salman, you must ignore her craze. My son is in the hospital and she kicked the mother
out of the hospital. Enough. Salman you have to
finish this soup. All right. I especially asked you to please drive carefully but you, you don’t listen to anyone
when you get angry. So, it’s good that at
least you found out. You are a very difficult person. Yes, I am very
difficult but for others, for you I am just a tad bit. Whenever I thought, you have always proved
my thinking wrong. Enough dude, now I am embarrassed that
what sort of a person I am No, there is nothing like that but do you know, that I used to feel that you were not a good person but then you even
proved that wrong. So then when you felt
I am a very nice person, then what happened? Then I fell in love with you but I actually got very scared when
I heard about your accident, Salman. What did you think? I was scared that something
might happen to you. Did anything happen? God forbid, anything happens
to you and please, now there shouldn’t
be any joke on this. All right, there won’t be any joke,
I am sorry. Come on, finish this now. Okay, I am having it. That’s it. Okay last. All right. my son slipped because of this, move it away, immediately
move it away. Madam Sr, the other madam has especially
put it over here and the younger sir didn’t
fell because of this but this. Enough, you are always arguing,
go away from here. yes , yes.. Oh, what are you trying to prove
by taking so much care of him? What do you mean? All this has happened because of you. Because of me? Yes, if you hadn’t called him, he wouldn’t have picked up the call so he wouldn’t have been
distracted from driving. But when I called him,
Salman hung up absolutely fine. Okay so that means you are
trying to prove me wrong? Madam Jr, don’t worry, God will make everything right. You must go. Oh God, have mercy. You are crying, my child? Why was Mehreen shouting? Aunt says that the accident
happened because of me. She is wrong, I saw it myself, Mehreen was the one
who called him last. But she is not ready to accept this. So let her, she is habitual of this, my child. When you know so much, then why don’t you speak for me? There should be someone in
this house who can talk for me. What happened, Urooj? Do I not love you? What sort of a question is that? Obviously, you do. That’s all I wanted to ask. But why did you ask this? because I don’t love
you so much that I should suffocate you. What sort of love is that I should start causing harm to you? Are you indirectly talking about Mom? I guess, According to Aunt Mehreen, I am responsible for your accident, it is because of me that
all this has happened. God forbid,
why would I want that you… This what mom has said to you? Let me talk to her. What will you say? You will say something again and she will blame me for everything. I don’t care when you didn’t do anything, then why you should be blamed? Let me talk to her, let me ask her. What do you think? That accidents happen
due to someone’s will? I don’t feel anything like that. Then why are you accusing
Urooj of my accident? Oh, okay, so my Salman is here to argue
with his mother today that don’t you dare say
anything to his wife. There is nothing like that but Urooj is worried too. So, wasn’t I worried for my son? My son’s car had an accident, but he has been saved
after so many prayers. You are right but… No ifs and buts, I knew it, I knew that Urooj would one day prove
me wrong in front of my son. Please mom, enough, I remember it pretty clearly that while I was driving you were the
last person who called me but you are forgetting it. Look, mom, I know you are the
best in the world I am just trying to say that we should stop proving
each other right or wrong. Do you understand what
I am saying? Salman? Hmm? I wanted to ask you something. Ask? It is about your personality
so don’t get angry now. What is it? Aunt Mehreen and Aunt are always trying to prove they
have similar rights over you, and both of them are trying
to win from each other, and you get all the pressure. You are right. I have been facing this forever. Do you know what
I saw in the hospital? What did you see? When you were semi-conscious
and calling mom, by the time aunt Mehreen would
have gotten up from her place, aunt restlessly got to you. Then what happened? Then what? Aunt Mehreen scolded
aunt a lot later on. You have noticed
it absolutely correctly, even I don’t understand that why are they always
fighting so much for me? I think Salman that you must sit with both of
them and talk to them. What happened? I will definitely ask them when
I find the right time in life. Anyway, mom is not in
the mood right now so we can’t ask them anything. Okay then, I will leave now, see you. Urooj, my child, what are
you doing here alone? Nothing uncle, I was feeling suffocated inside so thought I should come
stand outside in open air. Okay, okay, if that’s how it is let me
sit with you for a while, you will feel better. Sit down. Thank you. I feel that you are thinking
something. uncle, I am thinking that how can someone hate
anyone for loving? Hate because of love?
I don’t understand, my child? I mean to say that aunt Shaista loves Salman as well and aunt Mehreen loves him too but they have a war between
each other for Salman’s love, why is that so? Umm, Urooj my child, you must
not think about it at all because it has been going on the
same way since Salman’s childhood. Yeah. Exactly, that is what
I want to know. I mean, how can any aunt
love with so much intensity? Umm actually Salman is the
only child of this house so this snatching away
in love keeps on going on. What happened? You started thinking
something again? Come on now, go inside, you will stay outside
and get cold,  go rest. Go inside, good girl.
you will keep on thinking, Okay. What happened? why have you made
such a bad face? you have forgotten to
control your emotions. When have I not been careful? I have been living life with so
many restrictions, so carefully. If you are being careful then why does this Urooj
who has just recently come into our family is have doubts? What doubt? That you are always making a problem
out of Mehreen and Salman’s love. Mehreen herself is responsible
for that too, no one else. She is a mental patient. that’s amazing, she should do wrong with everyone and she has the license of
being a mental patient? I don’t want to argue with you, you have to be careful, please. Aunt Mehreen and Aunt’s fight for Salman
is felt by everyone and everyone even tells
it in their own words but no one says that there is nothing like that. How she got aunt out
of the hospital room but uncle, uncle didn’t even discuss
it with anyone. Aunt Mehreen behaves very strictly but it’s surprising how
Aunt never counters. Aunt? Hey Urooj, my child, Mehreen must have 
asked you not to meet me, you have secretly come
 here to meet me, right? Yes, that’s how it is, but I don’t understand aunt why does aunt Mehreen do that? Actually, the thing is that I love Salman a lot and that is what Mehreen doesn’t like, she thinks everything
that is Salman’s is hers and then you are his wife, won’t she show off her rights on you? Hmmm Now do you understand? So then, that picture in your room with a child in your lap, who is that? That is Salman, he was that young, and I have been raising 
him since then, that is why I love him so much. It means that you never had a child of your own? hah! Yes, just consider it that. Let me go inside. You cannot go inside, your wife will come here. okay, okay. What are you here for? Don’t you know I have found this 
house with so much difficulty. But why have you come? Hey I don’t have
 money for my medicine, give me money for medicine. What medicine? What has happened to you? Don’t you know? What medicine? The medicine that I… That medicine. For God’s sake leave my life, you must go from here, go! I don’t have more money 
for your addiction. Don’t do that Wasai, 
give me money, what do you do with all the money 
that you earn? Tell me? Tell me? I send it to Behram who put money in your case else you would in 
the prison right now, go, go away. Give it to me Wasai, don’t do this, give it to me. Give it to me else I will die,
 give it to me. Wait, I will give. What are you doing. Wasai, you are very good, you are very good,
 you are very good, you are very good. Where are you lost, my friend? It’s good that you came Nasir, I am tired of living a monotonous life. What are you saying? You have an ideal life, well-established business, and a loving wife, what else does a man want? I want peace. I don’t have peace in life. What happened? 
Any business problem? No there are no 
business problems, family problems. You have romance around you and don’t forget that you had a love marriage. I feel like I have been sandwiched between
 the triangle of Urooj, aunt and mom. Hmm, so that’s the case. I don’t understand there is always 
some problem in the house, there are always fights, Urooj is always upset, I am so worried. Salman, it has been such 
less time to your marriage, these are the days 
of your enjoyment. I don’t even remember 
I had a love marriage. Do one thing, you must take sister-in-law for 
a long drive at night
