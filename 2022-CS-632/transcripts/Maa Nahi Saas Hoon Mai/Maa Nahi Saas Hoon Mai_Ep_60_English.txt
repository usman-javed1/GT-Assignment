Where were you, Salman? You didn’t attend my call and
 neither did you call me back. You know,
 I get worried like this. I am fine. Thank God my Salman is fine. It is good that you too off the burden 
named Arooj of your head. Arooj is not a burden. And hear the news you were 
restless to hear, hear it out. I am not leaving Arooj. Why? It was your decision. You didn’t want to live 
your life with her. She is not worthy 
of being your wife. Why should I punish Arooj 
for being my wife? I am the one who dragged 
her out of this home, then how can I ask her 
where she spent the night? And she was at Shanzay’s home. How do I believe this? It is possible she was
 lying to both of us. Even if it is a lie, still I am ready to accept 
it as the truth. I don’t know what sort of 
magic does this Arooj do. Salman says one thing and 
comes back doing another. Anyway, Salman has still come alone. Things are still under my control. I will see. I will see. So finally brother Salman’s 
misunderstanding got removed. This is the biggest flaw of love is that it is easily misled. Meaning, you want to say that brother Salman really loves you, and he finds an issue 
daily because of this. Salman is not like that. An issue is made and put in his ears, and then he says what he hears. Anyway, the more I bad mouth brother Salman, the more you will defend him. We will end this exercise here. Tell me, what is the plan? I just have one plan and that is, I have to find my parents at all cost. But how will we do all this? We couldn’t get any record 
from the police station. But, there is still one service that is left. What service? Newspaper. We will go to the library and take out all the old newspapers, and I am sure all the old 
newspapers will be there. Actually, Arooj, you are right. You are right. We should go. Okay, have tea. Okay. I am really sorry, man I don’t know what happens 
to me and then everything gets ruined. This is my fault. I admit it. Right now, I want to stay here with my parents. But, why? I have to search for my parents. Going to that home,
 I get lost in myself, then how will I be able
 to find anyone else? So, I will help you find them. I am with you. Arooj is not a burden. And hear the news you were
 restless to hear, hear it out. I am not leaving Arooj. Why? It was your decision. You didn’t want to live
 your life with her. She is not worthy 
of being your wife. Why should I punish 
Arooj for being my wife? I am the one who dragged 
her out of this home, then how can I ask her 
where she spent the night? And she was at 
Shanzay’s home. How do I believe this? It is possible she was 
lying to both of us. Even if it is a lie, still I am ready to 
accept it as the truth. I have had enough. My son, Salman answer me straight to my face, instead of listening to me, 
he gives me justifications, that too for the sake, of a person who has no importance 
of this home in her heart. Such a girl, who has come in between
 my son and I. I will make sure Salman 
gets rid of this Arooj, today. What does this Arooj 
think of himself? My Salman is mine. Only mine. Elder madam. Elder madam. Yes? Go ahead! You had called me. Yes, as soon as Mr. Salman comes, tell him to meet me. And tell him that I have said he should
 come meet me immediately. Is everything fine? Are you feeling okay? I am fine! Leave. Sure. What is the point of 
getting worried now? Arooj’s fear has escalated
 this to this point. If she had told us earlier, then the situation 
wouldn’t have been so bad. This was not Arooj’s fear,
 it was mine. I had told her that no one in her in-laws should find out. Look Naseema, no matter how much
 you dislike a news, if it is true, it makes its way. This reality of Arooj had to be revealed. I don’t know if Arooj’s relation will be 
able to stay safe or not? The truth has been revealed Naseema. God supports the truth. Arooj, please believe me. In future, no excuse or action will not force me to 
take such decisions. You can stay for as
 long as you want. But when you think of me, then come. I will wait for you. Take care of yourself. You people have given
 me the strength ... ...to keep my head raised
 in front of Salman. Child, we didn’t do 
anything great. Parents never let their 
children bow their head. One more thing, parents are not just the 
ones who give birth, the parents who bring you 
up also have a high stature. You continue your attempts. I pray that you find the mother 
who gave birth to you. We will be happy. and yes, one more thing. Only the one who has the
 desire to win, wins. Where do I find myself. I am unable to find anything. Not in the police station, 
nor in the library. How do I find myself? Where do I look for my parents? Oh God, help me. Greetings mama Greetings. I had a call made to you to come early. Yes, I was in a meeting. Son, Salman, you have changed a lot. Earlier you used to come 
running on one call from me, now you even ignore my orders. There is nothing like that, mama. That’s how it is you know. Anyway, you leave this, tell me, where is your so called wife Arooj. I had told you, she is at her parents home. But she should be here where you are. You have no importance in her eyes. And how did you get to this conclusion, and why did you take it out, when I had told you, that I gave Arooj permission to stay at her parents home 
for as long as she wants. Salman, my love, you are the star of my eyes, I am your mother. I understand your pain. And I know this well that despite you asking her, Arooj must have said no to coming. There is nothing like that, mama. You have a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? Fine, then, call her. We will see how much importance 
you have in her eyes. Call her, ring her on her 
phone. Come on. Salman. Salman, where were you? You had said you would 
come pick me up. You forgot as always. Yes, I was… you did good that you came. Someone else is also present here. Do you have the manners to greet? Greetings aunty. Arooj, thank you so much you came, or else mama… You made a really good 
decision, Arooj. The biggest shelter for a woman is her home, child. Yes, aunt. And I consider this home my shelter but maybe aunt Mehreen is not ready to 
tolerate me in this home. What do I say about Mehreen? She has never let anyone stay 
in this home peacefully. By the way, what 
does she say now? She has Salman standing 
in a court room and she is comparing her
 love and my love. You think yourself, aunt, how difficult would all this 
be for a son. and mothers with a lot of interest make their sons go through
 this difficulty. Where is Salman now? He is in aunt’s room. The same thing must be 
happening again. She left her phone. Aunt. Salman, where were you? You had said you would 
come pick you up. You forgot as always. Yes, I was… you did good that you came. Arooj and Salman were 
not in contact. Salman didn’t know when 
Arooj had to come. This is also Arooj’s game. Salman has left Arooj but this Arooj is acting of having good relations 
with Salman to degrade me. Salman is naïve. He is acting along with Arooj. Anyway, no issue. I have the drop scene 
for this drama. Elder sir, your tea. ok Wasai, my green shirt is 
kept inside, iron it. Sure. What happened Shaista? For how long? How long will Mehreen hide behind her mental health and make the life of both
 these children hell? How long? At times I want to tell her
 the whole reality. I don’t care and have no 
mercy and tell her that Salman is not your son, Arooj is not your daughter in law. That’s why, she should stop this injustice. You will not do anything like that. The biggest lie of Mehreen’s
 life has saved her life. How long will we hide this truth? Huh? And how long will we hide it for? One day everyone will find out, and also Mehreen. Take it easy, Shaista, when has she done this 
for the first time? She always does this. What are you doing here? Elder sir asked me to
 iron his shirt. Yes, you took it, right?
 Go iron it. Go. Sure. Wasai. Wasai, wait. Listen to me. Yes, younger madam? I have heard everything. What did you hear? That Salman is not 
aunt Mehreen’s son. Now, I… I also want to hear it from you. What you have heard is correct. What is this, Wasai? And how? I can only tell you what 
you have found out. A long time ago, elder madam had an accident. She got a head injury and she forgot everything. When she regained consciousness, then she started calling
 little master her son. That’s it. For the sake of her life, everyone believed this 
lie to be the truth. and who all knows this is a lie? Elder sir, madam, me. And now you. and Salman? Does he know, that he is not aunt 
Mehreen’s son? No. I don’t care and have no 
mercy and tell her that Salman is not your son, Arooj is not your daughter in law. You will not do anything like that. The biggest lie of Mehreen’s
 life has saved her life. How long will we hide this truth? Huh? And how long will we hide it for? One day everyone will find out, and also Mehreen. Take it easy, Shiasta, when has she done this 
for the first time? She always does this. A long time ago, elder madam had an accident. She got a head injury and she forgot everything. When she regained 
consciousness, then she started calling
 little master her son. That’s it. For the sake of her life, everyone believed this 
lie to be the truth. What is all this, my God? You brought two similar 
people at one place. Salman too is living a life like mine. How is it possible, that, Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son? Although, aunty loves him a lot. What is this story? I will have to find out.
