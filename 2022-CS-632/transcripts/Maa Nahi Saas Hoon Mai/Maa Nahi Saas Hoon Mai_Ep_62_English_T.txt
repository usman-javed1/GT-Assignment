[22.32] I know you are good. 
In fact, you are very good.
[27.20] We have been trying Mehreen for years,
[31.56] expecting good from her is out stupidity.
[36.56] But…
[37.32] The issue is of this but.
[40.20] Even you know what is correct.
[45.44] But still, no one is willing to say 
aunt Mehreen is wrong.
[49.44] You tried speaking the truth,
[52.20] was Mehreen able to tolerate it?
[55.92] Have no relation with your relations 
is a heavy truth.
[70.68] You are right, child.
[77.40] I cannot Salman my own, 
even after he is mine.
[88.88] Okay, whatever happened, 
happened.
[91.52] Be careful in future.
Okay?
[96.64] There, poor Salman is also worried.
[102.04] And Arooj, please, 
for God’s sake,
[106.00] you will reveal this secret 
in front of Salman.
[114.40] I will tolerate the suffering of Mehreen,
[119.00] but I cannot see Salman suffering.
[125.72] Promise me you wont tell him.
[144.68] Thank you.
[178.68] Where are you coming from?
[182.16] I had told you in the morning.
[183.84] So?
[185.04] Will tell me again break hell loose?
[187.64] Where are taking my son 
in the name of outing?
[193.72] My son is stuck in weird problems.
[196.32] You lied and took him to 
your parent’s home.
[200.00] Aunty, I am already really worried. 
I will talk to you later.
[203.08] Keep your worry to yourself, 
why are you worrying my son?
[208.88] The worries of me and 
Salman are not different.
[211.88] I don’t care about your worries, 
I only worry for my son.
[215.96] Where did you leave my son? Huh?
[217.96] My son is stuck in a weird problem.
[229.04] I will tolerate the suffering of Mehreen,
[237.08] but I cannot see Salman suffering.
[291.32] Idrees, when Mehreen got unwell, 
then…
[294.20] Yes, I know.
[298.96] I know that you know. 
Hear me out completely.
[303.64] Okay, go ahead. Go ahead.
[306.76] You called the same doctor
[309.44] who knows Mehreen’s history, right?
[313.72] Obviously, the doctor that 
knows her will come.
[319.68] I was scared.
[322.20] What were you scared about?
[323.88] What if the doctor had something 
about it, then?
[329.76] What are you saying Shaista?
[331.84] The doctor hasn’t found out recently,
[333.28] he knows since Salman’s childhood 
that Salman is not Mehreen’s son.
[342.60] How can he make such a mistake?
[346.24] Yes, you are right.
[348.60] I am right, but nowadays you are 
thinking too much nowadays.
[353.48] Mehreen has made me reach 
this state.
[356.36] Shaista, please.
[423.36] You tried speaking the truth,
[426.08] was Mehreen able to tolerate it?
[430.48] Okay, whatever happened, 
happened.
[433.08] Be careful in future.
Okay?
[438.32] There, poor Salman is also worried.
[443.68] And Arooj, please,
 for God’s sake,
[447.48] you will reveal this secret 
in front of Salman.
[455.76] I will tolerate the suffering of Mehreen,
[460.56] but I cannot see Salman suffering.
[467.20] Promise me you wont tell him.
[511.20] How is aunty feeling?
[516.24] She is better.
[518.84] Why did you not go to 
meet her yourself?
[524.24] You know she doesn’t like me.
[529.28] Mom has always liked everything I like.
[536.40] But I don’t know why this couldn’t 
happen in your case.
[544.92] Strange.
[553.20] In so long, this has happened 
for the first time,
[557.52] that you didn’t take aunt’s side.
[574.00] This will not happen now.
[580.28] I know mom is unjust at times.
[583.72] Now see,
[585.56] she has taken this to her heart that 
you said that I am not her son.
[589.68] Now this thing will not leave her heart.
[595.92] Don’t worry,
[599.52] I will take this thought from her mind.
[631.88] Arooj.
[633.64] What happened, Arooj?
[642.04] Everything is fine. Don’t worry.
[650.80] Now I feel I will have to 
go to the doctor.
[653.60] Yes, but why is everything fine?
[657.64] Now the surprise wont remain a surprise.
[660.88] It is not something that can 
remain hidden.
[684.56] Thank you so much.
[687.36] You know,
[689.08] you have given me the biggest 
happiness of the world.
[700.84] You sit, I will go meet aunty.
[881.44] Who is it?
[884.88] It is me, aunty.
[898.48] You.
[901.48] Why did you come here?
[906.40] Yes,
[910.88] I had to say something.
[914.20] Now what is left to say?
[919.96] Something is left.
[924.96] I was left to say sorry.
[933.00] I am sorry.
[935.88] You are Arooj, right?
[948.32] Yes.
[949.76] Oh,
[952.00] so you came to apologize 
for what you said.
[965.56] For a sentence that was 
left incomplete.
[970.20] Meaning?
[974.44] I wanted to say that,
[978.48] Salman is not just your son,
[982.92] he is also my husband.
[997.04] To highlight this right,
[1002.00] I couldn’t complete my statement.
[1015.28] I am sorry.
[1022.24] You can say anything, Arooj
[1025.36] but remember one thing.
[1034.92] You have no right on my Salman.
[1045.72] You are not well,
[1049.16] you rest.
[1110.20] She said something so big so easily
[1116.20] and then she came to say, 
sorry aunty.
[1213.52] Did you send breakfast to mama?
[1216.00] Yes, son.
[1217.20] I had told Wasai to take Mehreen’s 
breakfast to Mehreen’s room.
[1222.00] There is no need for that sister in law,
[1225.28] I am fine now.
[1230.20] You seem completely fine now.
[1232.44] I feel happy for you.
[1237.20] Why wouldn’t I be?
[1239.56] When the criminal accepted their crime
and apologized,
[1259.32] then what is the reason 
to stay upset?
[1269.80] Okay,
[1271.48] that is a good thing.
[1277.92] By the way,
[1279.80] I also have good news for you.
[1293.72] What good news?
[1296.36] Arooj will tell you this.
[1309.76] Arooj, tell her.
[1319.44] Arooj, child,
[1323.96] if it is good news, 
then tell us immediately.
[1337.88] Arooj you will create a lot of suspense,
I will tell everyone.
[1346.80] Actually,
[1348.96] we have a doctor’s appointment today.
[1368.20] Really?
[1373.56] That is really good news child.
[1376.20] You hid such a big news.
[1492.16] Wasai, pick up all the toys
[1494.60] and remove these pictures too.
[1496.52] Yes, elder madam.
[1498.80] Why are you removing the toys? 
What has happened?
[1502.44] When you cannot have a child,
[1504.80] then see these toys,
[1506.28] they look so unreasonable 
in your room.
[1508.56] Like binoculars in the hands of a blind.
[1510.80] But don’t get the toys removed.
[1513.80] I will remove everything from this home,
[1517.00] that has snatched the happiness 
of becoming a grandmother from me.
[1522.96] Wasai, pick up all these toys and
throw them in the store room.
[1537.68] When a woman becomes a mother,
[1545.76] then the husband becomes 
closer to her.
[1558.24] In such a situation a woman 
becomes stronger.
[1613.28] Arooj.
[1623.04] Arooj, doesn’t give me 
any importance right now,
[1634.24] if she has a child, then,
[1641.96] I will just lie in a corner
[1650.52] and no one will care about me.
[1688.80] My heart is in a weird confusion.
[1697.56] I...
[1704.48] I want to be a grandmother,
[1714.04] but I cannot see Arooj
[1722.68] becoming a mother, either.
[1776.52] The fever still hasn’t gone down.
[1778.84] The doctor was saying it will 
go down in an hour.
[1784.24] Here, I have brought the medication.
[1791.48] Did you give her the medication
the doctor gave?
[1793.80] Yes, I did,
[1796.16] but her fever still hasn’t gone down.
[1798.52] It will go down.
[1801.44] If the doctor had given a medicine
to bring down the fever quickly,
[1805.88] then the child wouldn’t be 
so restless.
[1810.28] Arooj.
[1813.00] Yes.
[1814.84] Yes, mama’s love.
[1818.04] Arooj.
[1819.92] You will see our Arooj’s fever 
will go away quickly.
[1823.36] You will be absolutely fine. Right?
[1934.88] I feel,
[1938.28] I will have to stop the search 
for my parents for some time.
[1945.84] Come in.
[1961.00] You can leave.
[1966.96] But why Arooj?
[1968.56] Why would you have to do this?
[1971.84] My condition will not allow me 
to do this.
[1975.12] Condition?
[1976.48] But your condition is completely fine.
[1988.96] I am pregnant.
[1993.04] Seriously?
[1994.40] My God. It is a great news.
[2000.96] Shanzay,
[2002.76] after the birth of the child,
[2009.08] I will start searching for 
my parents again.
[2020.48] And you will see,
[2022.32] I will make sure I find them.
[2031.72] Now won’t you get me sweets 
on this happy occasion?
[2035.12] Hmmm…I will.
[2037.76] But right now we have cake. 
Wont cake be enough?
[2039.96] No, not at all, 
this cake won’t work.
[2042.72] I want a party.
[2044.24] Okay fine, you will also get a party.
[2046.56] When?
[2067.56] Such a big deceit.
[2208.72] Oh wow.
[2214.48] No matter how smart someone 
tries to be,
[2220.84] they get caught themselves.
[2239.84] Now madam Arooj is 
under my control.
[2248.44] Now where do I start from?
[2255.84] Should I start by humiliating Arooj or
[2262.20] should I first tell Salman?
[2272.92] Or should I make an announcement 
in front of everyone?
[2293.00] Now, no matter what I do,
[2304.08] this time Arooj won’t win.
