[27.00] Wasai?
[30.92] Wasai?
[32.32] Coming.
[34.52] Yes, Madam Jr,
[36.28] do you need something?
[37.88] Wasai, my mom is here,
[39.80] make a good cup of tea for her.
[41.92] Sure, sure,
[43.72] you go sit with her,
[45.72] I will bring the  tea.
[47.48] Okay.
[48.84] Listen, did you give tea to the staff?
[63.52] What happened?
[65.44] Actually,
[67.40] Madam Sr ask me to waste it.
[73.68] Waste it?
[75.92] But don’t worry,
[77.88] I will sneak out from
Madam Sr in a while.
[89.52] I guess, you couldn’t understand
me properly yet, Wasai.
[93.64] I am not habitual
of working secretly,
[98.04] when someone cannot differentiate
between white and black, right or wrong,
[102.08] what can we do then?
[105.84] But, Madam, what will you do now?
[110.24] Don’t worry Wasai,
[113.68] I will arrange for it myself.
[137.00] You were saying that this is an office.
[140.64] How are you sister Mehreen?
[144.44] This is an office,
[146.24] lower your tone, my staff works here.
[151.08] Not yours,
[152.64] Salman’s staff
[154.40] and if this is an office
[156.80] then why have you made an environment
like it is your parents’ house?
[190.84] Mom, have tea.
[193.92] No, I don’t feel like it.
[204.40] I apologize to you for
aunt Mehreen’s behavior.
[213.04] That’s how she is.
[214.92] No my child,
[216.64] you don’t have to apologize
[222.36] but bringing office to home
[229.84] is not something that
[232.68] she got so upset.
[238.08] If anything happens
against her will,
[241.16] she cannot bear it.
[244.04] She should bear it,
[247.60] people get patient by this age,
[251.84] they don’t act stubborn
like a baby.
[257.44] You are saying all this
because you are my mother.
[260.20] My child,
[261.64] are you comforting your
own self or me?
[266.40] I wish,
[269.08] doing all this comforts me.
[272.32] I am your mother,
[275.12] I just want you to
always be happy
[280.40] but sister Mehreen
[282.60] doesn’t seem to be
happy in any situation.
[287.88] When anything
gets into her mind,
[291.96] she wants to see
it accordingly.
[295.16] Arooj,
[296.48] you must reconsider
decision.
[302.52] My child,
[303.68] home is more important
than office.
[307.44] mom, I am doing all this for
this home and Salman.
[313.24] Do you know that
[314.96] since I have joined this office
[316.88] and looked after the
finance department,
[319.32] there is  corruption
worth millions here.
[324.48] Now its different that
[326.04] I don’t have any solid proof yet that
[329.52] I can disclose their names.
[332.60] Fraud?
[334.48] Who is doing it?
[343.84] Okay if you don’t want to tell,
[346.96] okay then I will leave
[350.28] you just stay happy.
[352.32] And mom,
[353.84] don’t discuss anything with dad.
[356.80] He will get worried if he listens,
[358.88] he will take tension
for no reason.
[360.76] it is not in fathers’
control that
[363.24] they can listen to
daughters’ problems.
[368.60] Nature has given this responsibility
as well to the mothers.
[375.08] Okay then I will leave.
[387.52] The email is here.
[389.56] whose?
[392.08] Madam asked me to fix meeting
with Stoneberry Marbles,
[396.36] their dates have been
confirmed.
[403.20] So then what could happen
in the meeting?
[408.16] Whatever is happening,
[409.40] company will come and tell
everything to Madam Arooj.
[412.76] Why is Arooj after me?
[416.48] You are very brave boss,
[418.12] you can go tell them where ever
the marble has been used.
[421.12] Haven’t you strated talking a lot?
[423.60] Sir shutting me won’t help,
[426.68] my share in this work is
only a handful anyway.
[432.96] That’s how it is,
[433.84] the bigger the position,
the bigger the share.
[436.60] Boss may I tell you something?
[438.76] I am just an employee,
[440.52] even if I get fired,
[442.20] I will get a job somewhere,
[447.32] boss you are the owner,
[449.68] you won’t get the possession.
[453.08] Let’s give 65 lacs to
stoneberry marbles.
[459.56] Company people will get shut
[462.04] and madam will fail too.
[464.56] 65 lacs is not a small amount
[467.88] so then what should we do boss?
[472.80] I will think of something,
[480.16] I will think.
[489.36] Miss Naseema, you?
[492.52] You are here?
[493.84] when did you come?
No one told me.
[496.24] How are you?
[497.48] I ma fine,
[498.60] I was just in Arooj’s office.
[501.68] Come let’s go sit inside.
[503.76] no, I am getting very late,
[505.52] just let me go now.
[506.92] How can I let you go like this?
[508.76] You are our son’s mother in law,
[510.52] it is my duty to be hospitable towards you,
[513.68] it is the tradition of this house. Come.
[516.60] Hey, no, thank you so much,
[518.08] it has been very late,
I will come some other time.
[519.88] No, I won’t listen to anything.
[521.80] Come, let’s sit in my room. Come.
[529.56] so then tell me, how is
your office going?
[532.56] My office? Our office.
[537.20] okay our office.
[539.20] Tell me how is your day going so far?
[541.08] Are you enjoying?
[542.52] hmm, it’s going well,
[546.44] you must also know that
[549.12] there is staff in this office and
[551.84] we need a tea and coffee
maker in this office too.
[555.48] So then ask Wasai,
[556.64] she will make it and send it for you.
[560.40] I guess you are forgetting
Aunt is here too.
[565.84] So what?
[567.60] She has restricted coffee
and tea for the office.
[572.04] Okay don’t worry,
[574.12] I will send a tea maker,
hmm?
[576.80] Okay thank you.
[579.72] Take care.
[616.12] hello?
[618.08] Yes Mr Imran, I am fine,
[620.72] yes we have fixed the meeting
for tomorrow morning.
[624.72] I will see you by God’s will,
thank you.
[641.12] The tea is here too.
[646.76] Madam,
[648.04] do you need something else?
[649.20] No, no, you may go.
[650.56] Okay.
[655.36] Whenever I see Arooj,
[660.12] I feel like saying one thing to you.
[662.92] What thing?
[665.24] You have raised Arooj very well.
[671.28] You have fulfilled the
responsibility of  a mother.
[676.52] Sister Shaista,
[678.36] it is your love that
[682.24] you see my Arooj that way.
[685.96] That’s how Arooj is,
[687.40] lovable.
[691.60] And you should keep
smiling that way too.
[695.36] You are right,
[697.04] those mothers are very lucky
[700.44] who leave their daughter’s in laws
house with a  smiling face.
[710.28] What did you start thinking?
[712.48] I am thinking
[714.72] you are so affectionate
towards Arooj,
[720.84] I wish my Arooj would have gotten
a  mother in law like you.
[728.80] I wish I could tell you that
[731.68] I am Arooj’s mother in law
[734.60] and Salman is my son only.
[741.32] Shaista,
[744.24] if you mind what I said untimely,
[749.00] I apologize for that.
[750.56] No, no, there is nothing like that,
[753.08] what you said untimely,
[755.28] I have heard that for the
first time in my life.
[763.44] You are not taking anything,
don’t be formal,
[766.32] have it.
[767.36] Wasai has made this
fruit salad herself.
[770.48] She cooks really well.
[773.60] Have it.
[825.44] Accounts Department?
[826.68] I need statement of
the last 6 months,
[829.04] quickly, thank you.
[845.48] What is this strange way that
the corruption has been done,
[857.84] it looks like
[861.44] the one who was doing it is not
scared of being caught at all.
[875.24] And what’s cruel is that the
audit has been done too
[878.76] which means a lot of
people are involved.
[882.36] It is surprising that
[883.88] how is such a big business
functioning like this?
[904.80] I am your mother,
[907.56] I just want you to always be happy
[911.56] but sister Mehreen
[913.80] doesn’t seem to be
happy in any situation.
[919.12] When anything gets into her mind,
[923.16] she wants to see it accordingly.
[926.48] Arooj,
[927.76] you must reconsider your decision.
[933.72] My child,
[934.92] home is more important than office.
[951.24] Madam Jr?
[956.20] what happened Wasai?
[960.68] I know why are you sad here.
[967.92] It is easy to bear your own pain
[971.76] but it is very difficult to bear
the pain of your loved ones.
[977.12] But I can help you feel better.
[982.32] Madam took your mom to the room
[986.28] and she served her pretty well,
[989.44] your mom left very happily from here.
[1000.60] Really?
[1002.36] yes.
[1007.24] Where is aunt?
[1008.40] In her room.
[1020.28] Hey Arooj my child,
[1022.20] where are you going in this speed?
[1027.56] What happened my child?
Is everything all right?
[1030.84] Thank you, Thank you,.
Thank you, thank you so much.
[1033.64] For what?
[1035.28] because you gave my
mom so much love and respect,
[1039.12] so thank you for that.
[1040.88] Are you mad?
[1042.24] What have I done?
[1043.72] I was just hospitable
to the guest at home
[1046.00] and especially your mom,
[1048.68] that is my duty.
[1051.76] Okay now go,
[1052.80] your staff must be
waiting at the office.
[1055.32] Oh okay, okay I will be right back.
[1101.56] What is all this?
[1102.80] How do you guys work?
[1106.08] Why is every paper incomplete?
[1108.96] I need all the reports on my
table by tomorrow morning
[1114.04] and Miss Amna,
[1115.72] you will follow up on all this.
[1118.24] You all may go now.
[1136.16] Ma’am,
[1137.96] I need 5 minutes from you.
[1140.52] Sure, tell me?
[1141.36] Come sit here.
[1143.12] No, no, I will sit here.
[1145.64] Okay.
[1150.68] What is all this?
[1155.56] I don’t understand anything,
[1156.84] are these accounts or
a gamblers game?
[1161.52] What do you mean?
[1163.64] And you are saying that?
[1167.56] I mean,
[1169.32] you are being afraid of
addition and subtraction?
[1171.96] Arooj I haven’t taken
a degree in crime,
[1174.20] I am an accounts expert,
[1175.48] I don’t understand
what is all this?
[1178.76] But what has happened?
[1182.96] Who is this Mr Idrees?
[1186.08] He is Salman’s uncle.
[1188.32] He looks after all the finance
of the head office.
[1196.92] But why are you asking?
[1199.08] Any amount without records,
[1201.28] he sign those papers
and become a barrier
[1203.76] and he is very influential.
[1206.20] There are two types of
things that are influential,
[1208.92] either good or bad.
[1211.36] Now what are you talking about?
[1214.40] Now he is the uncle of your husband,
[1218.52] what can I say
[1220.16] but I would just say that
[1222.60] he is not affecting positively.
[1226.64] I Know that
[1229.96] and to end these affects,
[1233.20] I would need your help.
[1235.32] Don’t worry,
[1236.48] I am your friend,
[1238.24] and I will also take salary from
you for this work.
[1241.20] Thanks.
[1281.84] do you see?
[1282.96] Do you see what is going on?
[1285.24] Home has become office and
office has become home.
[1289.28] And I am worried here and
you are being happy?
[1293.36] Everything against
Mehreen makes me happy.
[1301.32] Thank God
[1303.16] that there is at least
someone so brave
[1305.32] who can teach Mehreen a lesson.
[1310.16] you just care about Mehreen and
[1311.60] you are not concentrating
on what I am saying.
[1313.92] I am concentrating
[1316.48] and I always do,
[1318.28] but you always shut me up.
[1325.64] But Arooj,
[1328.12] she always finds her way,
[1331.12] that is why my vote  is with Arooj.
[1333.12] Hey
[1334.32] you don’t know what
the actual thing is.
[1337.36] What is the actual thing? Tell me.
[1339.48] what is the purpose of business?
[1342.04] To earn money.
[1343.12] Exactly,
[1344.00] so that money is being
gradually captured,
[1346.28] her own people, her own staff.
[1347.60] Do you understand
what is going in?
[1350.60] No, I don’t understand.
[1355.48] Tell me is she doing good or bad?
[1359.72] If she is doing good
[1362.00] then why do you have
a problem?
[1364.36] You should support her
[1366.48] because all the business
belongs to our son Salman.
[1374.16] You just be happy that
[1376.12] your daughter in law is taking
the business to the new heights.
[1381.84] You wouldn’t understand
what I am saying.
[1386.32] You are right.
[1392.16] If you were so smart,
[1395.04] you would have had a separate
business of your own.
[1428.04] Shaista is right though,
[1433.80] but what is she saying she
has no proper idea about it.
[1443.60] I have always considered
this business my own
[1449.64] but now Arooj has made me
realize it is not my business,
[1456.68] now it feels
[1459.32] like that my honor is also at
stake along with the business.
[1478.28] brother Idrees,
[1479.48] you have started to remain
worried all the time.
[1483.20] I am worried.
[1485.32] Mehreen , you couldn’t stop Arooj.
[1489.16] What can I do brother Idrees,
[1491.32] Salman’s love hinders.
[1494.16] I have to tolerate everything.
[1499.28] Salman’s love?
[1503.32] You are right,
[1504.96] Salman’s love for Arooj
has beat everything,
[1507.96] Salman, in Arooj’s heart…
[1508.92] If Slaman loves anyone,
that is just his mother.
[1514.40] you still think so?
[1517.08] I don’t have to think,
[1518.80] that’s how it is.
[1523.44] I cannot stop her from
working from home now,
[1526.44] what she has done
has left me speechless.
[1529.80] Who can make you speechless?
[1531.12] You are always…
[1531.92] Brother Idrees, you know that
[1533.36] I don’t talk without a logic.
[1544.44] What is it , brother Idrees?
[1545.68] What are you thinking?
[1547.28] Nothing,
[1548.68] nothing at all.
[1550.56] I will leave now.
[1561.96] What should I do about this Arooj?
[1565.36] She has bothered everyone.
[1597.72] Hello? Yes Salman?
[1602.36] Arooj, send Ammad to my office.
[1607.88] Is there any issue?
[1609.08] Anything special?
[1610.76] No there is no issue, and
[1613.20] if there is any issue anyway,
[1615.80] I am the MD of this company,
[1617.84] you cannot question me.
[1621.60] Hmm, you are right.
[1625.88] I want to meet who you
have appointed for once.
[1631.12] Okay I will send Ammad.
[1634.80] Thank you.
[1661.96] yes madam.
[1663.60] Come to my room.
[1665.56] Okay, coming.
[1676.12] Yes, madam?
[1679.60] Salman has called you.
[1681.80] Umm, should I go right now?
[1689.04] yes.
[1690.44] Okay.
[1695.64] What is there to be so
worried about?
[1702.32] In fact, I don’t even know
why is he calling you?
[1708.40] And look, please
[1710.04] do not try to be over smart at all
[1713.16] else our entire game will be ruined.
[1716.16] ok
[1717.20] We don’t have all the proofs
right now to disclose anything,
[1723.72] we have to keep these corruption
details hidden from everyone.
[1728.00] Don’t worry,
[1729.68] I very well know what
to say when I get there
[1735.24] and what needs to
be kept secret.
[1738.04] Okay,
[1740.36] just talk as much he asks you.
[1745.20] May I go now?
[1769.80] Arooj I haven’t taken
a degree in crime,
[1772.00] I am an accounts expert,
[1773.32] I don’t understand
what is all this?
[1776.80] Who is this Mr Idrees?
[1779.80] He is Salman’s uncle.
[1781.92] He looks after all the finance
of the head office
[1785.20] Any amount without records,
[1787.60] he sign those papers
and become a barrier
[1789.80] and he is very influential.
[1792.36] There are two types of things
that are influential,
[1795.12] either good or bad.
[1797.44] Now what are you talking about?
[1800.52] Now he is the uncle
of your husband,
[1804.68] what can I say?
[1837.24] Hello?
[1840.28] Yes, send him in.
[1841.92] Thank you.
[1853.96] Come in.
[1857.84] Greetings sir.
[1860.00] Greetings, have a seat.
[1862.52] Thank you.
[1866.80] Welcome to our company.
[1868.40] Thank you, sir.
[1869.96] So tell me,
[1871.40] how do you feel after
joining our company?
[1873.92] Sir, everything is perfect.
[1877.32] And your boss?
[1880.48] Are you comfortable
with your boss?
[1883.36] Sir, how wouldn’t
I be comfortable,
[1885.68] I guess you don’t know
we were classmates.
[1891.64] What a surprise.
[1896.48] It has been 6 days since
you joined this company
[1899.68] and I am finding this out today.
[1902.12] Sir, she has always
liked giving surprises
[1904.80] so I guess she wanted
to give you a surprise?
[1907.92] yes, true that,
[1911.88] I have heard that
[1913.60] there have been some problems
going on in our accounts
[1917.48] that is important for me to know.
[1919.96] And that was the reason
that Arooj hired you for.
[1922.48] Sir, we are working,
[1923.68] as soon as we find
out anything that
[1925.32] is important to bring
in your information,
[1927.28] I will definitely tell you.
[1930.56] Perfect, rest,
[1932.60] if you have any problem
or need anything,
[1935.56] so do let me know.
[1937.08] Sure sir.
[1939.80] You may leave now.
[1941.00] Thank you sir.
[1958.84] Why has Salman called Ammad?
[1963.36] Salman is the owner,
he can call anyone, boss.
[1966.60] No, it is not something minor,
[1968.72] there is definitely something.
[1970.24] Boss, I think you know everything
[1972.28] that is why you are feeling
that way and you are worried.
[1975.64] You are right but
we have to be careful.
[1979.96] By the way, true that.
[1983.36] Boss,
[1984.04] it is a war between your cleverness
and Madam Arooj’s intelligence
[1987.96] and intelligence always wins.
[1991.40] I have asked you to talk less.
[2017.84] what an interesting thing,
[2022.84] I just need to manipulate Mehreen
[2025.12] and she immediately
[2029.24] wakes up and gives a result.
[2035.20] Now what does Shaista know that
[2038.00] whatever Mehreen is doing,
[2039.88] I am the one who provoked her.
[2044.44] This is an amazing chance,
[2047.92] I will change the whole scenario
without coming on eye.
[2051.44] I will change it.
[2083.84] Hey when did you come?
[2085.60] And so silently?
[2087.44] I? Just came right now.
[2089.56] You tell me,
[2090.80] how was office?
[2096.08] Very tough.
[2097.92] Under the admin officer.
[2102.68] Admin officer?
[2104.16] Hmm, Aunt Mehreen.
[2110.36] You are calling mom
and admin officer,
[2113.12] by the way she is the owner.
[2115.20] Absolutely, I know that too,
[2117.64] but in this  possession, I and
Aunt would be 50-50 partners.
[2122.28] Really?
[2123.96] So now director of finance
will talk about 50-50?
[2128.32] Not at all,
[2130.04] I just said that as your wife.
[2134.52] Anyway, tell me how
did you like Ammad?
[2139.52] He is nice, he has the potential.
[2143.48] He used to top in the university
[2145.80] and then went to America so
[2147.24] I didn’t stay in contact with him.
[2151.48] Okay so now we will have to see
[2153.20] how beneficial he is for our company.
[2155.92] Trust me,
[2157.12] we will only get benefit from him.
[2160.12] Let’s see.
[2161.88] You freshen up,
[2163.16] I will get tea for you.
[2165.32] I even have to give these
clothes to Wasai for ironing.
[2167.68] All right.
[2189.52] Idrees?
[2192.88] You came back from the office
during the day, today?
[2195.08] yes, I have come from
the office to the office.
[2197.96] Okay,
[2198.88] so yes, Arooj is there in the
office only with her staff.
[2202.68] I know.
[2203.80] If you want to have
something then tell me,
[2205.88] I will arrange it
[2207.24] because Mehreen has restricted
the kitchen being used for Arooj’s office.
[2211.92] Yes, the one who will try to
shut the kitchen of others,
[2214.16] their own kitchen
will be shut too.
[2217.08] What do you mean?
Who are you talking about?
[2219.12] Nothing, I will come eat after
I am done with the meeting.
