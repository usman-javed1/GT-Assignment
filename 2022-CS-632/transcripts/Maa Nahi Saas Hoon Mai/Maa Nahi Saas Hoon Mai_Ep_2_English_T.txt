[109.08] I have put all my property, this home,
[112.48] the entire business in Areej’s name.
[136.28] Sir, the doctor is calling you.
[139.68] I will come. 
Okay.
[142.68] Come on. 
Come.
[146.76] Nurse. 
Yes?
[153.12] It is a big shock for your family.
[156.52] All hell broke loose on us.
[159.92] Mr. Idrees, when Mr. Waqar was
brought to our hospital,
[162.24] he was already dead.
[167.00] There is a small formality, 
you please sign here.
[186.44] Be strong Mr. Idrees.
[221.48] I am so sorry, mama.
[225.68] I don’t even have the words
[228.76] that I tell you to be strong.
[232.64] Who has given such a big sorrow,
[238.40] He will give us courage too.
[241.88] Without a doubt.
[247.28] How are you, Shaista?
[251.32] I am fine,
[253.28] I just have a little pain.
[261.12] Mama, how is Mehreen?
[264.80] She is still in the ICU.
[273.04] Just pray that she gets fine soon.
[278.56] Wasai.
[279.84] Yes, madam?
[281.80] Where is Salman?
[283.92] You don’t worry about little master,
[286.44] he is downstairs with Rehman baba.
[293.96] Mama, what do the doctors say?
[297.52] Idrees told me that
[300.32] we cannot say anything till 
she regains consciousness.
[311.48] Madam.
[314.68] Thank you, Wasai.
[320.28] Mama,
[322.12] is Mehreen badly injured?
[325.16] Yes,
[326.92] just pray that she regains 
consciousness.
[333.76] and Areej?
[336.56] Did you find out anything about her?
[339.92] No, not till now.
[343.48] Everyone is searching for her.
[346.52] I pray to God that wherever 
my daughter is, she is fine.
[546.92] Do one thing,
[548.80] check this entire area, no matter 
how deep the hole is,
[551.76] you have to look there too.
[553.68] No home, no place should 
go unsearched.
[556.76] I will surely find a clue from here.
[559.28] The whole area. 
Take all the men.
[560.88] Come on, Akbar. Come on. 
Come on. Come quickly.
[564.76] Come on. Inform me immediately.
[572.84] Hello.
[573.80] Hashim listen to me carefully.
[576.56] I am unable to get in touch 
with the manager.
[578.64] I have spoken to the IG,
[580.48] you tell the manager to contact the IG.
[582.92] Fine, sir, don’t worry.
[584.76] I have spoken to the IG and 
I am present at the accident sight.
[589.56] But Hashim, there should be nothing 
lacking in search for Areej.
[593.68] Sir, don’t worry,
[595.48] I will be with the police at every step.
[597.88] We are reaching with Waqar’s 
dead body shortly.
[602.28] Okay sir.
[603.92] May God give you patience and 
increase the levels of Mr. Waqar.
[607.32] Amen. Amen.
[609.68] Fine, goodbye.
[633.00] I don’t see any other wound than 
that on the head,
[636.16] but the patient is unconscious, 
this is something worrisome.
[640.68] Sir, in how long do such patients 
regain consciousness.
[645.16] At any time or never.
[651.20] Look, the whole thing is that 
you are worrying a lot,
[655.80] you pray to God.
[657.12] I have full hopes the child will be found.
don’t worry.
[660.48] Look, I don’t think so.
[662.52] The child was really young,
[664.12] and she might have fell from the mothers arms 
and she didn’t even survive.
[668.12] No, no, you are wrong.
[670.52] As per my investigation, 
madam didn’t get hurt so badly,
[674.28] and it is possible that 
the child is safe.
[678.16] Sir.
[679.64] Sir, I couldn’t find anything 
about the child.
[681.56] But I found this blanket from 
the shrubs at the back.
[684.56] Keep it in the bag. 
Sure.
[686.00] We will make the family identify it.
[687.48] Okay. 
Go.
[688.40] But sir, if this blanket belongs to the child,
then where is the child?
[691.84] Look, the investigation is 
ongoing right now,
[694.52] the case has not been solved.
[696.28] Don’t worry, pray, all will be fine.
[698.96] And you will see it is really late at night.
[701.92] I think it will be much better if we do 
our investigation in the day tomorrow.
[707.08] Fine, sir. As you wish.
[710.20] Come on.
[824.08] Waqar. My son.
[830.72] What happened to my son?
[834.32] No, let me see.
[836.28] Let me see my son. 
Let me see.
[840.60] Oh God, what happened?
My son.
[845.56] Let me see my son. 
He left me and went.
[854.04] Oh God, what has happened.
[856.84] What has happened to my son?
[873.08] You know, it is no less of a miracle for you
and Mehreen to survive such a big accident.
[879.28] You are right.
[882.48] God was kind and 
the two of us survived
[889.04] or else the accident was bad.
[891.68] How is Mehreen now?
[896.60] She got injuries on the head,
[900.24] and some wounds too
[904.12] but she still hasn’t regained 
consciousness.
[906.76] Did you find out about the child?
[910.00] No, nothing till now.
[912.92] Now 24 hours have passed.
[917.00] God knows, till now some animal 
must have eaten her.
[921.08] Shaista,
[923.08] what are you saying?
[925.40] Say something good.
[927.32] God knows what condition my innocent 
daughter will be in.
[930.76] If God wills, she will come home safe.
[937.44] Yes. Yes.
[940.68] She talks nonsense.
[946.92] You will find her if she is alive.
[969.12] Miss Mehreen
[972.12] Miss Mehreen can you hear me?
[975.00] Miss Mehreen.
[978.40] It is a good sign that she can feel.
[995.68] Sir, the SHO is here to meet you.
[998.40] Okay, thank you.
[1003.56] Okay, I will talk to you. 
Greetings Mr. Idrees,
[1005.72] how are you? Are you fine?
[1007.04] Come to the office. Come  on.
[1014.32] Have a seat.
[1016.40] Thank you.
[1021.04] Yes?
[1023.00] Mr. Idrees,
[1025.32] I want to tell you that the DIG inquires 
from me about this every day
[1030.24] and I am putting in my full effort.
[1033.60] I am surprised where the child went.
[1036.04] There is no clue other than the blanket.
[1038.12] Sir, there are two villages on 
either side of the road,
[1041.40] and I have searched every single home,
[1043.40] but we cannot find anything.
[1046.32] You tell me, we will publish an ad 
in the newspaper
[1049.08] along with prize money.
[1051.56] Sir, I had thought about it,
[1053.96] but then I thought you are 
a big businessman,
[1057.24] what if you don’t find it reasonable.
[1058.88] No, no, nothing like that, we have to 
search for the child at all costs.
[1063.00] Fine, sir.
[1069.48] Yes, Mr. Hashmi,
[1071.16] the SHO has advised that we give an ad 
for Areej being lost in the newspaper.
[1077.04] Yes, I will email you the pictures.
[1080.32] Yes, you work on it. Okay.
[1144.08] How are you, mama?
[1147.48] I am fine, child.
[1150.04] Tell me, what is the update on Areej?
[1153.88] The police is trying its best. 
God will be kind.
[1158.72] My happy and content home got
the evil eye.
[1163.12] My son left me and went,
[1167.60] God knows where my granddaughter is,
[1170.00] what condition she is in?
[1172.96] And the poor daughter-in-law is 
unconscious in the hospital.
[1181.88] Mama, Areej will be found
[1185.60] and also Mehreen will be fine,
[1188.20] you just pray.
[1190.72] I have been praying for all these days.
[1244.08] Salman.
[1248.00] Salman.
[1252.08] Salman.
[1255.76] Salman.
[1259.48] Salman.
[1270.56] Salman.
[1275.16] Madam Mehreen, 
how do you feel now?
[1278.68] Where is my Salman?
[1280.68] Call him.
 Call Salman.
[1284.04] Salman is here. 
Call him.
[1288.16] What are we doing here?
[1291.24] I want to go from here.
Call Salman.
[1295.28] Note the blood pressure,
[1297.48] also note the patient, everyone.
[1299.16] Don’t worry, you are with us here.
[1302.08] You had a minor accident.
[1304.64] Minor?
[1306.56] I had a really bad accident,
[1312.12] Salman was in my lap.
[1317.56] Call him. 
Call him.
[1319.56] But no one from the injured was Salman.
[1322.80] Salman was not in the car…
[1324.80] Okay tell me, who was driving?
[1326.28] My husband, Waqar.
[1329.52] Waqar was driving.
[1341.40] Mehreen,
[1344.20] Waqar left us and went.
[1350.32] He left?
[1353.80] Where did he go?
[1356.36] Waqar is not in this world.
[1360.08] My son has left, Mehreen.
[1367.80] Waqar.
[1369.88] Waqar.
[1372.48] Call Waqar.
[1376.24] Call Waqar. Call him.
[1382.88] Please, you two go out. 
Bring her mask quickly.
[1402.72] Yes, madam Mehreen has regained 
consciousness again, but…
[1406.20] But what doctor?
[1408.24] I had a doubt about this earlier.
[1410.56] Actually, the thing is her memory has
stopped at a particular time,
[1414.60] and she remembers a few things, 
and she has forgotten a few things.
[1417.48] Maybe this is why she doesn’t remember 
this accident, this shock.
[1425.92] So, the condition Mehreen was 
in right now,
[1429.00] what was all that?
[1431.76] I am trying to explain 
the same thing to you,
[1434.60] if she goes through the same 
shock again,
[1437.20] then her condition will be the same as 
it is right now.
[1440.44] But doctor, what will be the result of 
this condition Mehreen is in.
[1444.40] She can lose her memory forever,
[1446.52] she can have a brain hemorrhage 
or she can even lose her life.
[1458.64] So doctor, what will we have to do?
[1461.56] Don’t try to remind her of anything.
[1464.84] By the way, who is Salman, 
who she is constantly calling her son?
[1468.92] He is not Mehreen’s son, he is my son.
[1475.64] But Mehreen is calling her, her son.
[1479.08] If the situation is such,
[1481.64] then everyone will have to accept 
whatever she thinks as the truth,
[1485.56] and all this is really necessary 
for her life.
[1491.08] Doctor, does Mehreen only remember this
[1494.36] or does she also remember 
her daughter, Areej?
[1496.56] She doesn’t remember anything 
other than Salman,
[1498.84] but Mr. Waqar is still in her memory a little.
[1503.24] Apart from this, she doesn’t remember 
anything
[1504.76] and my advice would be don’t even 
try to remind her of anything.
[1508.88] This will be good for her life.
[1512.76] Thank you.
[1522.96] What condition is my daughter in?
[1526.52] She is saying incomplete things, 
completely lost.
[1533.40] She remembers something,
she doesn’t remember something.
[1541.48] God,
[1543.80] please give Mehreen health soon.
[1592.36] Sit, Mr. Hashim.
[1597.56] Sir, you joined the office?
[1600.20] You should have rested for some time.
[1603.28] I realize the intensity of your shock.
[1606.12] Yes, Hashim, the sorrow is big
[1608.92] but life doesn’t stop.
[1612.04] I also have to look at this business too.
[1614.36] That is true.
[1616.08] Sir, we had to shift some things, 
the work of parties are stopping.
[1621.24] You do one thing, tell the IT to shift 
my computer system to Waqar’s room.
[1627.68] Sir, will you sit in Mr. Waqar’s room?
[1630.60] Yes, when I have to take care 
of Waqar’s work after him,
[1634.88] then it is also necessary 
for me to sit there too.
[1637.76] Fine, sir,
[1638.68] then I will ask the IT and shift 
your system there.
[1642.48] Okay?
Fine, sir.
[1661.64] Sir, you are going to sit in 
Mr. Waqar’s room?
[1664.08] Yes, when I am taking care of 
all of Waqar’s room,
[1667.52] I want that I sit in this room
[1669.52] Sir, that is fine, but…
[1671.72] Do you want to say something?
[1673.36] Yes, sir. 
Go ahead. Go ahead.
[1675.96] Sir, as per company rules you cannot 
sit in Mr. Waqar’s place like this.
[1681.04] What does this mean?
[1682.44] I am the most senior after 
Waqar in this company.
[1685.76] You are sir,
[1687.32] but the company has a process
[1689.64] and everything will be done 
as per the process.
[1692.16] What process? Who will do it?
[1694.88] The company has board of directors
[1697.28] and we will have to seek permission 
from the head of the board of directors
[1704.40] Waqar was the head of this board,
[1707.60] now he is no more, so who will 
give the confirmation?
[1711.00] Sir, Mrs. Waqar.
[1712.56] After Mr. Waqar, she is now the head 
of the board of directors of the company.
[1723.12] Fine.
[1735.48] How was your first day in the office
 after Waqar?
[1740.80] There was a lot of work.
[1742.64] Waqar used to work his way, 
I work my way.
[1746.24] Obviously,
[1748.20] Waqar used to work in his style, 
but you work with experience.
[1755.04] But to work independently, 
I will the rights that Waqar had.
[1758.76] Yes, that is automatically yours 
after Waqar’s death, right?
[1763.32] No, it is not like that, Shaista,
[1765.52] the board directors decide this 
or the head of the board.
[1769.80] and who is the head of the board?
[1772.96] After Waqar, the head of the board 
is Mehreen.
[1780.12] If she signs, then I will automatically 
get the rights.
[1788.88] Fine, you don’t worry.
[1791.84] Mehreen is anyway, 
mentally handicapped.
[1795.52] How hard is it to make her sign it?
[1797.40] I will make her sign it.
[1800.56] Really? Is that so?
[1804.12] Wait.
[1810.48] Then here you go,
[1813.72] the letter is in this file.
[1816.00] You have a look at it, meanwhile
I will meet mama.
[1849.92] Mama, I will massage your feet.
[1851.96] Hey no, son, I am fine.
[1855.96] Shaista was telling me you went 
to the office today.
[1861.20] Yes, mama, I have joined the office.
[1865.76] Son,
[1868.08] after Waqar left the entire responsibility
is on you.
[1876.56] You just pray I am able to handle it.
[1880.88] Why not?
[1883.96] I am sure you will take care 
of everything well.
[1891.04] Now you too must be tired, go and rest.
[1895.12] Sure, mama.
[1918.56] As you all are aware,
[1921.20] Mr. Waqar is not in the world anymore,
[1923.64] so all the responsibility of this company 
is being given to Mr. Idrees.
[1931.48] You people please don’t clap.
[1934.04] I didn’t take this responsibility happily,
[1937.08] in fact, I did it out of helplessness,
[1939.52] and I want that I fulfill all these 
responsibilities along with you.
[1944.56] Sir, don’t worry, we are with you.
[1946.32] Thank you. Thank you. That’s what 
I expected from you people
[1949.60] and I will also need your help 
on every step going forward.
[1971.52] Where is my Salman?
[1974.28] I am here.
[1976.08] Okay, you are here.
[1978.12] I am here.
[1979.68] Salman. What? 
Where are you?
[1982.28] I am here.
[1984.64] Oh, you caught me.
[1986.44] Salman, where did you go?
[1992.40] Today my Mehreen is so happy.
[1995.16] Mama, I always happy with my Salman,
[1999.40] only if Waqar was here…
[2012.44] so he too would have been 
really happy to see us too.
[2020.20] But I don’t know why,
[2022.80] Waqar got a little unwell and 
he left us and went.
[2033.24] Mama, I am bored.
Come on.
[2038.16] Yes,
[2039.32] we will play. 
Come on.
[2040.56] Mama, cheating. 
Close your eyes.
[2042.92] Okay, I won’t cheat. 
Here you go. Is it done?
[2045.88] You go. 
Where are you?
[2047.40] Mama, I am here. 
I am here.
[2059.68] My child is so unlucky,
[2064.12] she considers someone 
else’s child her own.
[2068.96] God knows where her daughter would be?
[2072.32] What condition would she be in?
[2093.00] Sit.
[2096.68] I called you people to talk about 
something important.
[2100.16] Yes, mama, order us.
[2103.04] Mehreen thinks Salman is her son.
[2110.28] She always thinks that.
[2112.20] Earlier, she used to say 
that Salman is her son,
[2115.64] but now we will say that 
Salman is Mehreen’s son
[2125.56] Mama, what does this mean?
[2128.40] This means
[2130.40] that no one will make Mehreen realize 
that Salman is not her son.
[2140.56] And yes,
[2141.76] no one will mention Waqar and Areej 
in front of Mehreen,
[2145.68] this is my decision.
[2147.52] Yes mama, as you order.
[2149.44] Did you hear me too, Wasai?
[2151.52] Yes. Yes. Mama, as you order.
[2157.80] This is the matter of our Mehreen’s life.
[2162.08] Mama, what will happen about 
Mehreen’s mourning?
[2166.88] What do you mean, Shaista?
[2170.40] Mehreen is in her home,
[2172.28] so obviously, she will complete her 
mourning here.
[2179.00] You are the limit, Shaista.
[2193.20] These are the papers of all of 
Mr. Waqar Ahmad’s wealth
[2197.52] and ownership of his business,
[2201.16] and according to it, 
the owner of all her things
[2207.28] is Mr. Waqar’s widow, Mehreen 
and her daughter Areej.
[2220.00] What are you saying, Mr. Lawyer’?
[2224.40] everything has been put in Menreen
[2227.12] and Areej’s name?
[2233.36] No, no, this is not possible.
[2236.00] But, these papers were mad on 
Mr. Waqar’s directive,
[2242.00] and Mr. Idrees knows I am 
the legal advisor of the company,
[2248.08] so madam, these were 
an entrustment with me.
[2251.00] I would want that madam 
you take care of it.
[2265.16] I needed my son in this age,
[2272.04] and he left me and went.
[2281.32] Have patience, mama.
[2283.08] Have patience.
