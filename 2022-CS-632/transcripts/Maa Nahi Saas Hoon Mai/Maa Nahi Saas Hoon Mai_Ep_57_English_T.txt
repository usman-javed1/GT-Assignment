[65.32] Arooj, child.
[76.08] We have no one apart from you.
[85.84] A poor man like me could only 
give you good education.
[92.48] I did that.
[104.80] I just have this small home,
[109.24] that have I already put in your name.
[120.48] Apart from this, I have no other proof
[124.76] that I can tell you,
[127.84] that we have considered you 
our own daughter.
[137.48] Papa, please.
[140.00] Please, don’t say that.
Don’t say that.
[146.88] Arooj, child.
[210.56] Wasai.
[212.08] Yes, elder madam.
[214.04] Is your madam Arooj back?
[216.04] No.
[218.44] Fine.
[220.20] I will have to go myself.
[222.20] You ask the driver to take out the car.
[225.24] Sure.
[226.28] As you order.
[250.04] Wasai, where did Mehreen 
go with that stiff neck?
[255.92] She went to younger madam’s 
mother’s home.
[259.36] What?
[260.96] What did she go to do there?
[264.60] She was asking me 
why younger madam went
[267.80] to her mother’s home 
without informing anyone.
[274.44] Mehreen is a weird woman,
[278.32] she has gotten after Arooj.
[283.00] If Arooj is happy, why is she happy?
[284.76] If Arooj is sad, then why is she sad?
[288.76] This woman doesn’t even let 
anyone be sad properly.
[295.12] Wasai, you bring tea for me.
[297.12] Yes, madam.
[316.56] Oh wow,
[318.00] this madam Arooj is sitting 
in the feet of her parents
[320.64] after making our life 
and home hell.
[324.84] Hey,
[326.00] sister Mehreen, have a seat.
[328.12] Tell me, what happened?
[329.44] That good.
[330.72] Everyone is asking us 
what happened.
[332.72] Will someone ask her 
what happened?
[343.72] What is it about Arooj that 
you are so angry about?
[348.60] oh wow, Naseema, 
you are acting so naïve.
[353.36] All that my son and 
I are suffering from,
[355.72] it is all because of the upbringing 
you gave to this Arooj.
[361.84] You have a seat,
[363.52] and lower your voice.
[368.76] Your voice shouldn’t leave the home.
[370.36] Okay,
[371.52] the daughter of the home can leave
 the home without permission,
[374.24] but the voice cannot go out. 
This is a weird law you have.
[383.88] If you get upset like this,
[387.04] then how will you talk?
[388.68] The same way that I am talking right now.
[391.16] All of you people have driven my son mad.
[394.12] He has forgotten to be happy.
[395.88] And all this is because of this 
useless upbringing, Naseema.
[400.92] Aunty, you cannot talk to 
my mother like this.
[403.08] Arooj. Arooj, child.
[405.08] Mama. Mama, are you fine? 
Mama.
[408.12] Mama, what happened to you? 
Are you fine, mama?
[409.84] Arooj, I am waiting for you 
in the car, come immediately.
[422.32] Papa, look at mama.
[425.00] Mama.
[428.48] Arooj, child, you leave.
[436.96] After marriage, 
the home of the daughters
[440.64] is not their parent’s home, 
it is the home of her in-laws.
[449.28] I will take care of your mama.
[453.80] Go, child.
[551.88] A poor man like me could only 
give you good education.
[558.52] I did that.
[562.88] I just have this small home,
[567.36] that have I already put 
in your name.
[573.80] Apart from this, 
I have no other proof
[577.92] that I can tell you,
[581.16] that we have considered you 
our own daughter.
[643.52] Hello.
[644.92] Yes, Arooj. 
I am coming to get you.
[648.64] No,
[650.20] you don’t need to come now.
[654.04] What do you mean? 
Don’t you want to come?
[657.00] Meaning,
[659.96] I have come home.
[662.32] You have come home? 
With whom did you come home?
[665.12] Aunt Mehreen came,
[667.80] she brought me along.
[671.16] Arooj, what is going on?
[677.48] You left, you didn’t tell me.
[679.28] Mom brought you back, 
I don’t know.
[681.08] What am I after all? 
Who am I?
[713.76] All that my son and I 
are suffering from,
[716.08] it is all because of the upbringing 
you gave to this Arooj.
[722.80] You have a seat, 
and lower your voice.
[727.96] Your voice shouldn’t leave the home.
[729.52] Okay,
[730.72] the daughter of the home can leave
 the home without permission,
[733.32] but the voice cannot go out. 
This is a weird law you have.
[740.12] If you get upset like this,
[743.04] then how will you talk?
[744.72] The same way that 
I am talking right now.
[747.32] All of you people have 
driven my son mad.
[750.32] He has forgotten to be happy.
[752.20] And all this is because of this 
useless upbringing, Naseema.
[757.00] Aunty, you cannot talk to 
my mother like this.
[759.32] Arooj. Arooj, child.
[761.20] Mama. Mama, are you fine? 
Mama.
[764.32] Mama, what happened to you? 
Are you fine, mama?
[766.00] Arooj, I am waiting for you 
in the car, come immediately.
[795.60] I married Salman,
[798.52] so that my Salman remains happy
and my home becomes lively.
[802.44] How could my be lively?
[804.72] It has become lonely and 
Salman has gone crazy.
[816.80] Did you ask her Salman 
what she wants?
[824.44] She doesn’t have an answer
 to my question.
[827.44] Fine,
[829.20] then I will ask this madam myself.
[832.36] Look here towards me, Arooj.
[839.64] What reason do you have for making 
the environment of the home like this?
[849.20] Will you be quiet.
[867.88] This is the limit.
[869.88] Your court never ends.
[880.24] You always have a session of 
questions and answers all the time.
[883.56] What do you think of yourself?
[889.48] I don’t find it necessary to answer
any question of yours.
[894.04] You will remain completely 
quiet now!
[942.72] Did you see?
[950.16] Did you see, Salman?
[952.52] This is your mother’s respect,
[959.72] in the eyes of this Arooj.
[973.76] Did you see your mother 
get humiliated today?
[1100.40] Why did you misbehave 
with mom?
[1106.12] Arooj. I am asking you something,
[1107.80] why did you misbehave with mom?
[1109.68] Salman, please.
[1111.32] Right now I am really worried.
[1113.24] Don’t talk to me like this.
[1114.96] Arooj, what is worrying you?
[1116.64] I have been asking you for so long, 
you are not telling me anything.
[1118.72] What happened?
[1119.64] The style in which 
you are asking me,
[1121.32] how will someone share 
anything with you?
[1124.44] I am your husband, 
I can talk to you like this.
[1126.56] You are my husband. 
I wish,
[1129.48] had you kept the relationship 
of a husband
[1132.28] then I would have shared everything 
in my heart with you.
[1136.16] What do you mean?
[1137.88] Don’t we have a relationship 
of trust between us?
[1146.60] You ended that relation yourself.
[1150.04] But this is not the answer 
of my question.
[1153.36] Tell me, why did you misbehave 
with mom?
[1156.04] I don’t want to answer any question 
of yours, now.
[1159.92] Fine, then.
[1162.92] There is no place for you 
in this home either.
[1165.20] Get out of here.
[1166.48] What are you doing? 
Leave me.
[1168.40] Leave me. I say, leave me.
[1171.52] Salman, I am saying, 
leave me.
[1174.28] Where are you taking me?
Leave me.
[1176.00] Salman, what are you doing?
Enough!
[1179.56] No one will stop me.
[1190.48] And no one dare come after me.
[1193.92] Leave me. Leave me.
[1235.12] Leave me.
[1236.32] Leave…
Get out of here.
[1247.24] and don’t try to come back 
to this home again.
[1453.56] Idrees, listen to me.
[1455.28] Idrees, you make Salman, 
understand. Stop him.
[1459.48] Go and bring Arooj.
[1461.52] Where will she go alone 
so late at night?
[1463.40] No one will go anywhere.
[1487.56] Idrees, please.
[1560.52] Why are you laughing?
[1561.60] Obviously,
[1563.12] I am laughing thinking 
that you love me.
[1570.16] When did I say that?
[1572.48] Just now. 
You just accepted it.
[1580.96] Can I say something?
[1582.80] Yes.
[1585.20] You look even more beautiful 
when laughing.
[1678.76] You are calling mom someone else?
[1682.32] Then aunty too should think
[1686.04] I am not someone else,
[1690.28] I am your wife.
[1692.12] Then remember one thing,
[1696.16] she is my mother.
[1701.76] And don’t try to show your right 
on me in front of her.
[1710.96] She will not like it.
[1718.28] I hope you understood what I said.
[1747.44] Leave me. Leave me.
[1749.92] Leave…
Get out of here.
[1753.60] and don’t try to come back 
to this home again.
[1798.80] I married Salman,
[1807.76] so that my Salman remains happy
and my home becomes lively.
[1817.44] How could my be lively?
[1819.68] It has become lonely and 
Salman has gone crazy.
[1899.40] Come on.
[1902.96] Sit here, comfortably.
[1907.32] Sit.
[1911.40] Now tell me, 
what happened with you?
[1914.08] You left at this time of the night.
[1918.48] I didn’t leave,
[1922.16] I was dragged out.
[1924.24] What?
[1929.12] What do you mean 
you were dragged out?
[1934.08] Salman, pushed me out of the home.
[1940.00] What are you saying?
[1947.68] Did no one over there stop him?
[1952.72] Salman was really angry.
[1955.12] and what was the reason for his anger?
[1962.76] I was not answering anything 
he was asking
[1971.88] and you know well the reason
 for me not answering.
[2030.08] If you are with Salman, 
then who is with me?
[2033.80] I am alone.
[2036.24] Hey,
[2037.48] her dramas have started
[2042.16] so that all of us pay attention 
towards her.
[2045.84] I don’t want anyone to 
pay attention to me.
[2049.76] Leave me alone.
[2051.60] I want to be alone.
[2078.08] Will you be quiet.
[2080.80] This is the limit.
[2082.76] Your court never ends.
[2089.96] You always have a session of 
questions and answers all the time.
[2093.28] What do you think of yourself?
[2097.56] I don’t find it necessary to answer
any question of yours.
[2101.92] You will remain completely 
quiet now!
[2121.04] Arooj, what is worrying you?
[2122.76] I have been asking you 
for so long,
[2124.28] you are not telling me anything. 
What happened?
[2125.76] The style in which 
you are asking me,
[2127.68] how will someone share 
anything with you?
[2130.52] I am your husband, 
I can talk to you like this.
[2132.84] You are my husband. I wish,
[2135.64] had you kept the relationship 
of a husband
[2138.48] then I would have shared everything
in my heart with you.
[2155.52] What do you mean?
[2157.24] Don’t we have a relationship
 of trust between us?
[2163.92] You ended that relation yourself.
[2167.24] But this is not the answer 
of my question.
[2170.56] Tell me, why did you misbehave 
with mom?
[2173.12] I don’t want to answer any 
question of yours, now.
[2209.16] I don’t know understand that
[2211.28] even someone as educated 
as brother Salman can do this?
[2218.32] No Shanzay,
[2226.80] I don’t think Salman responsible
in all this.
[2232.56] What?
[2234.08] What are you saying?
[2240.56] Brother Salman treated you this way
[2243.24] and you don’t even think 
he is responsible?
[2245.52] I got tired of what aunt Mehreen 
was saying
[2249.08] and I shouted at Salman in my anger.
[2252.80] So what does this mean?
[2253.88] He will drag you out of the home 
on this?
