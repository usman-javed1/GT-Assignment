[27.16] Why did you come emptyhanded?
[37.00] Where is the file?
[48.00] Salman, I am asking you.
[50.76] What happened?
[56.64] Did Arooj refuse to sign?
[60.24] She is really cunning,
[61.88] she must have read that
she will lose everything…
[63.48] It is not like that, dad.
[71.16] She was trusting me completely,
[72.92] but that Wasai came at 
the last moment and took her,
[76.76] everything was left incomplete.
[80.28] So…
[81.56] so, now?
[88.56] That Arooj has really good luck.
[90.96] Now I cannot find that file.
[101.68] You cannot find the file?
[111.84] How is that possible? 
You go.
[114.36] Go and search again. 
Go.
[117.44] I have searched all around the home, 
I cannot find it anywhere.
[186.84] I am the owner of this business,
 property, wealth
[194.76] and I have found out about 
this really well.
[201.04] So my advice to you is stop 
dreaming about it.
[208.08] It is just a matter of me 
going to the court.
[212.88] I will ruin your twenty five year plan,
[219.24] in minutes.
[223.28] So, the result of what I said was that
[227.16] stay away from my husband, 
daughter and mother.
[232.96] This is better for you.
[333.20] Salman,
[336.04] I am really happy today.
[338.92] Okay,
[340.48] really?
[342.24] Yes.
[345.48] Every time you look at me with love,
[348.68] I feel I have all the happiness 
in the world.
[354.48] Then fine,
[356.52] I will increase your happiness 
further.
[361.16] The textile mill uncle Waqar thought
 of setting up in your name,
[366.72] now, I will complete that project
[370.28] and it will be in our daughter’s name.
[373.64] Areej Textile.
[376.04] Wow, this is a really good news.
[381.12] Are you happy?
Really happy.
[384.84] You are happy, 
so what else do I need?
[393.04] So, then tell me,
[395.28] how did you like shopping?
[399.08] You are really good.
[402.44] You too are really good.
[409.60] We spent such good time together
after so long.
[413.60] I really liked it.
[415.44] Me too.
[417.32] Now quickly sign this file,
[419.24] so that the work on Areej textile 
starts from tomorrow.
[422.04] Yes, so tell me, 
where do I need to sign?
[424.72] Fine, you do it.
[427.72] Here is the pen.
[470.12] Salman,
[474.12] did you find the documents?
[476.68] No, I searched the whole home.
I didn’t find them anywhere.
[480.44] By the way, Salman,
[482.76] when will you start working 
on Areej textile?
[487.72] Arooj, you sign it today, 
I will work from tomorrow.
[504.40] Yes, so give me the file, 
I will sign it right now.
[507.72] I am unable to find it. I searching 
everywhere. It is nowhere.
[511.48] Oh.
[513.32] That reminds me,
[515.04] when I was signing the documents
and I got up and left,
[522.64] then I felt that I took the documents 
in mama’s room.
[527.08] Maybe, but I am not sure.
[529.60] So, I will do one thing, I will go 
check downstairs.
[531.72] You wait. Sit here comfortably.
[534.52] I will bring it.
[559.60] Thank you, Arooj.
[565.96] I know, mom and dad don’t like you.
[569.76] But I will give you and aunt Mehreen
all the happiness in the world.
[576.60] and your daughter?
[580.20] Is this even something to ask?
[583.16] I will give my life for her.
[643.84] You are a liar.
[650.56] Not just a liar, 
you also show fake love.
[654.16] Arooj!
[655.04] Lower your voice,
[661.16] you showed false love to me.
[664.96] You made a fake apology to mama,
[667.44] and now…
[671.24] you will give your life
for your daughter?
[674.52] I am sure you are lying 
about this too.
[680.44] What did you think? Huh?
[682.16] What did you think?
I will not find out anything.
[686.40] I have read all those papers,
Salman.
[705.40] What will you do? 
Huh?
[708.80] What will you do with this wealth?
[715.96] Is all this more precious 
than selfless love?
[766.36] How did she find out?
[780.92] What happened? 
What are you looking for?
[783.44] Arooj, the file that 
you were signing,
[786.00] it was in my room. 
I cannot find it.
[787.72] Yes, yes,
[789.32] so what happened? 
Where did the file go?
[791.96] I had signed it.
[794.64] Yes, but one paper was left.
[798.28] So, come on, give it, 
I will sign it right away.
[801.16] How will you sign it? If I find it, 
then you will sign it.
[802.96] I have seen the entire home, 
it is nowhere.
[805.12] Hey, so it is our own home, 
it will be somewhere here,
[807.56] we will find it.
[809.68] By the way,
[811.60] I have not seen you so restless 
for anything before today.
[845.32] What happened? 
Was all okay?
[847.68] Did she sign it?
[856.56] Is all okay? What happened? 
Tell me something.
[863.96] Arooj has found out the reality.
[886.16] Now I will not tolerate both 
of them in this home.
[889.16] Salman, try and understand,
[891.32] this way, everything will get 
out of our hands.
[894.40] No matter what happened. 
No matter what,
[897.36] but I will not tolerate my insult.
[904.80] I cannot see both of them 
in this home, drag them out.
[911.12] But,
[913.48] how did they find out? 
I felt everything was fine.
[918.08] Aunt Mehreen saw the documents.
[936.40] Or else Arooj was blinded.
[939.80] No need to be emotional, Salman.
[941.72] This is not the solution
to this problem.
[943.24] This is the solution, dad.
[944.92] And the solution is that we drag them 
out of this house,
[947.60] before we face a big loss.
[949.64] Salman, look, this…
What do I look at dad?
[953.56] She has slapped me on my face.
[955.44] What?
[969.04] She dare raise her hand at my son.
[978.64] I will go and remind her of her worth.
[980.80] Wait, Shaista, wait.
[982.60] Before you do anything, think well.
[985.44] No need to think anything,
[993.20] and neither do you need to be scared.
[1000.40] After all,
[1002.28] Arooj has no proof that she is 
the owner of this property,
[1005.00] that is why drag her out 
of this home.
[1007.72] Exactly.
[1011.64] Salman is absolutely right.
[1016.84] We don’t need to be scared 
of them at all.
[1037.76] Let us do what we want to.
[1041.44] I will take care of her.
[1062.32] You are a liar.
[1065.20] Not just a liar,
[1066.72] you also show fake love.
[1068.72] Arooj!
[1069.64] Lower your voice,
[1073.48] you showed false love to me.
[1077.20] You made a fake apology to mama,
[1079.68] and now…
[1082.08] you will give your life 
for your daughter?
[1085.60] I am sure you are lying 
about this too.
[1090.08] What did you think? Huh?
[1091.68] What did you think? 
I will not find out anything.
[1096.00] I have read all those papers, 
Salman.
[1106.96] What will you do? 
Huh?
[1110.36] What will you do with this wealth?
[1114.72] Is all this more precious 
than selfless love?
[1174.52] Where are you going?
[1175.72] Elder madam…
[1176.92] There is no need,
[1179.08] go keep it back.
[1180.44] But…
What but?
[1182.60] Did you not hear me?
[1185.16] Go keep it back.
[1189.88] Now only my orders will be 
followed in this home.
[1196.96] If you want to work in this home,
[1199.64] then you will have 
to follow my orders.
[1202.28] Go from here,
 keep it back.
[1208.36] What is the matter, 
sister in law, Shaista?
[1210.72] Why are you scolding 
Wasai like this?
[1213.36] I am scolding her 
because of you.
[1216.04] Because of me?
[1217.28] Yes, because of you.
[1223.32] But don’t worry,
[1227.64] now she will not have to get 
scolded because of you.
[1230.88] Because now you and your 
daughter won’t live in this home.
[1240.00] What?
[1241.84] Don’t act so innocent.
[1243.92] You know well what your 
beloved daughter has done.
[1247.28] Arooj did nothing sister in law.
[1249.72] Salman was deceiving her
into signing.
[1252.16] Stay quiet.
[1254.48] You are calling my son a cheat?
[1260.44] Your daughter is the cheater.
[1263.20] Who played this entire game 
for this property?
[1271.84] But sister in law…
Stop it.
[1274.68] Now you or your daughter have 
nothing left to say or do.
[1284.04] You and your daughter get out 
of this home, now.
[1288.76] What are you saying?
[1291.84] I am saying what you hear.
[1295.04] Now go, take your daughter 
and leave from this home.
[1300.20] Remember, I am saying 
this really nicely.
[1303.76] Take your daughter and 
leave from this home.
[1307.92] I shouldn’t see you here.
[1353.20] Mama,
[1360.16] I feel you shouldn’t have 
a lot of hopes from Salman.
[1367.60] What do you mean, Arooj?
[1372.60] Meaning,
[1375.32] he can say and do anything.
[1379.36] What do you want to say?
[1384.88] I know you love Salman a lot.
[1394.84] But, don’t have so many 
expectations from him,
[1399.00] that you feel sorrow.
[1464.68] Salman,
[1466.12] did you find the documents?
[1468.60] No, I searched the whole home. 
I didn’t find them anywhere.
[1472.40] By the way, Salman,
[1474.76] when will you start working 
on Areej textile?
[1479.64] Arooj, you sign it today, 
I will work from tomorrow.
[1487.92] Yes, so give me the file,
 I will sign it right now.
[1491.20] I am unable to find it. I searching 
everywhere. It is nowhere.
[1494.84] Oh.
[1496.64] That reminds me,
[1498.56] when I was signing the documents 
and I got up and left,
[1503.80] then I felt that I took the documents
in mama’s room.
[1508.40] Maybe, but I am not sure.
[1510.84] So, I will do one thing, 
I will go check downstairs.
[1513.16] You wait. 
Sit here comfortably.
[1515.64] I will bring it.
[1542.96] Thank you, Arooj.
[1547.36] I know, mom and dad don’t like you.
[1551.16] But I will give you and aunt Mehreen
all the happiness in the world.
[1558.08] and your daughter?
[1561.56] Is this even something to ask?
[1564.52] I will give my life for her.
[1648.72] I am scolding her because of you.
[1651.32] Because of me?
[1652.60] Yes, because of you.
[1655.28] But don’t worry,
[1659.24] now she will not have to get 
scolded because of you.
[1662.56] Because now you and your daughter 
won’t live in this home.
[1666.72] What?
[1668.52] Don’t act so innocent.
[1670.56] You know well what your beloved 
daughter has done.
[1673.88] Arooj did nothing sister in law.
[1676.40] Salman was deceiving her
into signing.
[1678.88] Stay quiet.
[1681.20] You are calling my son a cheat?
[1731.00] Your daughter is the cheater.
[1733.64] Who played this entire game 
for this property?
[1737.52] But sister in law…
Stop it.
[1740.28] Now you or your daughter have
 nothing left to say or do.
[1748.16] You and your daughter get 
out of this home, now.
[1752.88] What are you saying?
[1755.96] I am saying what you hear.
[1759.16] Now go, take your daughter 
and leave from this home.
[1764.28] Remember, I am saying 
this really nicely.
[1767.84] Take your daughter and 
leave from this home.
[1772.04] I shouldn’t see you here.
[1808.84] Mama,
[1810.72] look here.
[1814.48] What happened?
[1816.04] Did someone say something?
[1818.96] Tell me. What happened?
[1824.52] These people are saying,
[1828.52] that we leave from this home.
[1830.96] Who is saying all this?
[1836.04] Sister in law, Shaista.
[1839.40] Who is she?
[1841.16] Who is she to drag us out 
of our home?
[1848.08] I don’t know what 
she thinks of herself.
[1850.84] I will teach her a lesson today.
[1888.64] Mom,
[1890.84] Arooj forgave me, right?
[1893.12] Yes,
[1895.20] she did.
[1897.24] I know her.
[1916.24] I will not give you a chance 
to complain in future.
[1921.08] Not, me.
[1923.24] Arooj.
[1925.72] I won’t.
[1934.20] Okay, I will go to the office now.
[1935.72] Sure.
[1960.44] You have heard it right.
[1962.88] You shouldn’t be mistaken 
in hearing it.
[1965.12] Because this is the order of me,
Idrees and Salman.
[1977.44] You and your mother have no other 
option but you accept this order.
[1983.12] You people are mistaken
[1985.68] and neither can you order me, 
nor my mother.
[1989.72] And this is our home as well.
[1999.68] This mask of deceit and fraud 
that you people had on your face
[2003.16] it has been removed.
[2005.44] Enough.
[2006.80] Stop your nonsense.
[2013.56] You are calling us cheaters?
[2018.84] There is no need to argue, Arooj.
[2020.72] You leave from this home, 
don’t blow this out of proportions.
[2024.20] You have blown it out 
of proportions.
[2026.76] Now the matter will end.
[2029.08] I am ending this matter.
[2031.16] Hah,
[2032.28] you had the right 
to start the matter,
[2039.32] but not to end it.
[2041.16] I will end it!
[2048.24] Look, child, how she is misbehaving…
[2050.12] Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future.
[2053.68] Look here. 
Salman. Salman.
[2059.48] Do you have no manners to talk?
