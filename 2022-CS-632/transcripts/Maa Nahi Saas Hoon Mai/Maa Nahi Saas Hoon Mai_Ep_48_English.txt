What fragrance are
 you wearing? Don’t you remember? It is your favourite that 
you presented to me. Oh yes, I had forgotten. So, you still have it with you? Yes. Do you know? Seeing your love,
 I have realized that being near and being 
together are really different. I want to live near you and with you too. Fine, then, tell me, how will you punish me? I accept it all. What punishment, when nothing happened? Where are you Wasai? Yes. Where the hell were you? I was cleaning little 
master’s room. I had sent you to call Salman, why has he not come till now? Little master and madam both are not in their room. Where did those two go? The guard was saying they went out. Oh wow, I don’t even know and those two have gone for an outing. This Arooj is a magician. Till yesterday those two 
were not even talking to each other, and see, today they 
went for an outing. Surely, she would have taken my Salman
 to her parents’ home. Wasai, tell the driver to take out the car. Take out the car right now. I will go and fix her in
 front of her parents and I will decide there as well. 
You leave. We are really lucky that we got people like you and a son in law like Salman. We never had a son, but we got a son in the 
form of our son in law. We look for love outside, in a beautiful scenery, 
in a sentence, but love is inside. How did you think of this? It is not necessary that you use words to say something. Some things should be 
understood without speaking. Hmm. Shall we go? Let’s go. You look really good like this. When you get upset, I don’t like you at all. Really? Then don’t upset me. I upset you? And what about you 
acting like a hero? You are good at heart, but you listen to everyone, you are misled easily. Okay fine, everything is fine between us. Thank God, and yes, thank you. It looks really beautiful. Yes, that is true. But you know what? What? It looks prettier on your wrist. I know about him. Madam. Madam. Come with me quickly, stop her. I will call you. What happened? Who do I stop? Elder madam, she is going to younger madam’s 
mother’s home to fight. Fine, you leave. I am Coming. Sure. I think Mehreen has found out about
 them ending their differences. Wasai. Yes, coming, elder madam. Yes? Did he take out the car or not? What happened to him? Has he gone mad? Did he not hear you till now? Elder madam, I have asked him. Go and check how long it will take. Sure. What happened Mehreen? Why are you so angry? I am going to go put Arooj’s 
parents in their place. They call their daughter 
to their home all the time. What objection do you have? Firstly, she went to her
 parents’ home, then she took my son and on top of that she didn’t even 
bother asking me. You have a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding? I am seeing everything 
happen in front of my eyes and you are saying I have 
a misunderstanding. Arooj and Salman didn’t go
 to master Shoaib’s home. Really? Then where did they go? They went for dinner. They met me before leaving. You think I am stupid. Both of them are not 
talking to each other, and they went for dinner. Maybe you don’t know those two have made truce. Oh, okay. So, brother Idrees made truce and both of them made truce. So, if someone is bad, 
then it is me. Wow. That’s why I tell you to be quiet. Someone who interferes in
 the love of husband and wife... ... always becomes the bad person. Sister in law, you want that I see all this drama quietly? Elder madam, the car is ready. Go. Go and tell the driver no, I am not going anywhere. Sure. See, mom is calling. She should know when 
and where I am. Especially when 
I am with you. Hello Greetings mom. 
How are you? Yes, Salman. Where are you son? How is your father in law, Master Shoaib and his wife Naseema. Mom, why are you asking 
me this suddenly? Son, if you are sitting 
there then tell me. Mom, we didn’t come to 
uncle Shoaib’s home. Arooj and I have come 
to the restaurant. Really? I thought you went there. Okay fine, you enjoy your dinner. But come home soon, okay? Okay fine, goodbye. Goodbye. Why are you looking
 at me like that? So, you called? Did you find peace? Did you not believe me? It is not about believing 
you sister in law, I just called. The children have their own lives, let them live their lives by their will. Don’t monitor and dictate
 them all the time. Hey, sister in law,
 what did I do? I just spoke to my son. Why do you forget your son is also 
someone’s husband. Forgetting reminds me, what is this sister in law? Salman is my son and I am helpless that Arooj 
is my daughter in law, but only you are aware 
of things about them, and the mother knows nothing. Only you can take things
 out of a matter. and you people always keep me engaged
 in such matters. Everyone has driven mad. Driven me mad. She came to lecture me. She was telling me, 
he is someone’s husband. My Salman is only my son, why does no one understand this? What was aunty saying? Nothing. She should just know where 
and when I am going. She was just asking that. She felt that you and I have gone
 to uncle Shoaib’s home. Really? Thank you. Thank you. Order. Is this what she was asking? And look at me in my worries, I forgot to ask her. You don’t worry, once we get free from dinner, we will go to meet your parents. No, no, Salman. It will be really late and aunty is waiting for you. We have not gone there and she is calling you. When we go there, God knows what she would do. Yes, you are absolutely right. If we go to meet them, then mama’s doubt will 
change into confirmation. You know, can
 I say something Arooj? Mom doesn’t like 
your parents at all. She doesn’t like me either. Yes, but there is a reason for that. I forcefully married you 
going against mom’s will. And you know what? Mom cannot tolerate sharing 
me with anyone else. Anyway, we will
 not talk about this, and neither will you
 spoil your mood. We will have food, and go home. I will go some other time. Okay? Waiter. That’s it, Wasai. Stop it. Let me massage madam. When you feel sleepy,
 I will leave. Why? Why are you not sleepy? Why do I feel that you 
want to say something? I remembered something 
from old times, madam. I am thinking I will say it. Yes, say it. Today I saw a bracelet in
 younger madam’s hand. What? You too saw that bracelet? Yes. And seeing it, I remembered that old time when Mr. Waqar made her 
daughter wear that bracelet. It was just like that. Right, madam? Yes, it was like that. But Wasai, it is something amazing, her mother forgot, but you remember everything. How can I forget madam? God knows what condition that innocent, 
flower like child would be? What do you mean how she would be? She will not be anywhere. Don’t you remember? The policeman said there are
 a lot of animals in the jungle. She must have died. The animals must have eaten her. No. No. madam. Don’t say that. The one who saves is bigger 
than the one who kills. Okay. Okay. Enough. In future don’t say this, understand? Come on, get up from here, 
and leave. You didn’t help with the pain in my feet, but you gave me a headache. Mehreen has lost her memory, we don’t know anything about Areej, that whether she is dead or alive. And Mehreen is considering
 Salman her son. What does all this belong to? Your Salman. My God. Master, Arooj has changed completely. Earlier, she used to visit at times, now she doesn’t even
 answer my phone. Naseema, it is possible she is busy in her home. Nothing is keeping her busy, apart from her mother in law, Mehreen. She is a really weird woman, she has the whole home confused. She has also hurt Arooj. You know our daughter is not 
someone who will get hurt. Every home has such hot and cold, you don’t worry. I am thinking that should we call her to stay 
with us for a few days. She will get relaxed. You decided yourself that Arooj is worried and she will come stay with
 you for a few days. Hey, now she is someone’s 
daughter in law, and your daughter after that. What are you thinking now? You are right. Now she is someone’s
 daughter in law. She was never our daughter. We only brought her up. Don’t say that, Naseema. The ones who bring the child 
up are actually the parents. and what about the 
ones who give birth? If the ones who gave 
birth to her cared, then they wouldn’t have left 
Arooj on the road. Master, they were not indifferent, they were unlucky. We named her Arooj as well. We changed her name. We changed it from Areej to Arooj. You don’t think too much. You will get unwell. Just pray for Arooj. What does a mother have to help a daughter 
at her in-laws’ home. Okay listen, won’t you get me tea today? I will bring it. Salman, you go upstairs, I will go meet aunt. You didn’t sleep till now. I have a question that is not letting me sleep. Won’t you ask what
 the question is? When you have thought 
of the question, then you will surely ask me too. You are really smart. More than required. By the way, my question is what is the magic that even after 
so much bitterness, my Salman is still praising you. Love is the biggest magic. Oh yes, I forgot. You trapped my Salman 
with this love. If the wife loves her 
husband, then you don’t call it trapping. But when a son forgets his mother and belongs just to the wife, then you call it trapping. Now what do I say about this? You have an answer,
 but you will not give it, because you are more 
cunning that I can think. I am surprised. You consider my acumen, 
ingeniousness and my love as cunningness. You know how to talk. Why are you going there? I am going to aunt. Aren’t you two getting 
a little too close? I understand all this well. There is no need to go to her. Go to your room. Wasai. Yes, elder madam? What happened? Why are you crying? No, elder madam, I am not crying at all. Sister in law Shaista said 
something to you, you are hiding it from me? Elder madam, anyone can say anything to us servant and we don’t mind 
what the master says. Wasai, I have never considered 
you a servant. Tell me, what the sorrow is if sister in law Shaista
 didn’t say anything to you? There is sorrow, elder madam, but not my own. Then? Then whose sorrow is it? I don’t know this madam. Wasai, you are saying really weird things, I don’t understand anything. You do one thing, go rest. 
Go to sleep. Yes, madam, as you order. My heart used to say wherever you are, you are alive. You have been brought up 
in my arms. I remember your fragrance. Elder madam and elder sir went crazy 
with happiness on your birth. All of them were really happy. If someone was not happy, then it was madam, and even today when 
I spoke about you, she got in a bad mood. You are so unlucky. Your mother doesn’t even know that you were in her life at one time. Mom. Mom, what happened?
 Why are you crying? Mom, what happened? Tell me. What do I tell you? What all do I tell you? Here. Right at this place. At this place, where that Arooj replied to me for everything, she misbehaved with me. Believe me, she misbehaved with me so much. So much that I was shocked
 with sorrow and sadness. Believe me, that Arooj misbehaved so 
much with your mother. Mom, but what was the reason 
for behaving like this? That Arooj, doesn’t need a reason 
to argue with me, Salman. But mom, there must be a reason. I just asked her how was your dinner. How was your mood with Salman? Did she not tell you 
that it was really good. Her tone was such like I have no right to ask her. You know I have not spoken 
to Wasai in this tone, and I… why does she forget that 
I am your mother? Okay, don’t worry,
 I will talk to her. No, don’t talk to her. You will go to the office, later she will insult me again. Don’t talk again at all. Okay fine, you come have breakfast. I will talk to her. No, I don’t want to have breakfast, I am going to sleep in my room. Mom. Mom. You didn’t go to the office till now? Now I understand, why you asked Wasai to bring
 breakfast in the room. Yes, so that the two of us can 
spend time together. A time that belongs to
 just you and I. Why don’t you say you 
have a problem with mom? And you didn’t come to the 
breakfast table so that you don’t meet mom, and I don’t find out the reality. What reality? You misbehaved with mom? Me? Don’t lie to me. She has spent the entire 
night in the lounge, she was really worried. What did I say to her? What did she say to you? She just asked how the dinner was with Salman, how did the time go, and in return…. She didn’t ask me anything like that. You are lying. Oh, wow. You call me a liar, she calls me a magician. She says that I have 
trapped in my love, and you are getting
 distanced from her. In what tone are you
 talking to me? Have you seen your tone? 
Your voice? It is weird. You get hurt and you don’t even 
want to hear a sound. And what about the 
wound on mom’s heart? I am not responsible for it. Then who is responsible? Huh? She is responsible herself. Because she assumes 
everything herself, like you? You put me in a spot. You ask me questions, I answer, because I am your criminal. And I am your criminal because I love you.
