Aunt, you? Even trying to look for you 
is one hell of a trouble. Why were you looking for me? You are right, why was I attempting to do 
this useless task? If you have any work from me, 
then let me know. Work, yes, I do have a work from you. Yes? Do one thing, just disappear somewhere, get lost in a way that Salman cannot 
find you even if he wants to. No Aunt, I don’t want to get lost anymore. Look at me, she is a mother, my child, you don’t get upset with your Mom, if there is something, 
I will come along, I will talk to your mother and 
try to make her understand. My child I know you very well, you are a very happy and lovely girl but I have been noticing 
for a few days you have gone very dull. I can feel your pain. I went for some work. To the police station to file a report 
for missing child? What is your connection with a 
25-year-old case? Yeah? I am asking you something, 
who is that girl? I haven’t asked a very 
difficult question that you are thinking so deeply about. Why am I hiding it from everyone? All this is painful for me but... I don’t understand why have Mom asked me 
not to tell anyone? After all, what will anyone think about a missing child except feeling 
sad for them? My child, I and your mother went 
to the highway to visit an unwell friend. On our way back we heard the voice 
of a crying baby behind the bushes, we looked around us, 
but there was no one. Your Dad moved towards 
the bushes, he found you there, you were crying very badly 
over there, my heart exploded seeing you. Wasai? Wasai? yes, yes, yes, Madam Sr? Where has the daughter of 
Master Shoaib gone? Umm. This is my house, not a hotel that anyone can come when
 they want and leave when they want. Stop, stop, stop, girl? What has happened to her? Why didn’t she hear my voice? Don't worry Madam Sr, 
I will go see. This girl is losing her mind 
day by day. Stop Madam Jr, 
stop. Madam Jr? Madam? Madam Jr? Madam Jr? Madam Jr? Open the door Madam Jr. What should I do? I will call madam. If Arooj was our own biological 
daughter, would we still give her to such 
a mother-in-law? We found Arooj, we accepted her with all our heart, we didn’t have any daughter 
of our own. My child, I kept on roaming around in 
the neighborhood areas with you in my arms but no one could recognize you, I even went to the police station but there was no report filed 
of a lost child. Did you knock the door? Yes, yes, madam I have knocked 
multiple times, Madam Jr didn’t open the door, 
come quickly. Come, madam, 
come quickly Madam. Madam Jr is not opening the door. Arooj, Arooj my child, Arooj, open the door. Arooj? Arooj, open the door, my child. What is all this going on? Why are you
guys making so much noise? Mehreen, Arooj has locked herself 
in the room. what has happened, 
sister-in-law? What are you saying, Mehreen? She was so worried. She was very upset for the 
past 2 days. I don’t know how her mental condition
must be right now. I don’t know about her 
mental condition but Arooj will definitely 
make us mad, there is something or 
the other all the time, she keeps on doing something, 
this girl has made me fed up. This woman is so heartless. Arooj, my child? Arooj, my child, it’s me, open the door. Wasai, do one thing, 
keep on knocking till she opens the door, 
I will call Salman. Madam Jr? Madam Jr? Open the door, Madam Jr. Hello? Yes Aunt, yes I understand, don’t worry, I will talk to her. If God wills. Yes. How can life be lived with precaution
and by being careful all the time? Something or the other moves 
away from its place. If all the time will be spent doing this
then when will those moments come when life will be lived carefree 
with smiles? Arooj, my child, please open the door. Arooj? Wasai, my heart is sinking. Madam, don’t worry, God will make things right. Farooq, my child, break the door. Arooj, my child? My child, what was this behavior? I don’t expect such stupid act 
from you at all. I am sorry, Aunt. I couldn’t understand myself 
what I was doing. My love, it is not important 
what you are doing, what’s more important is 
why are you doing it? I didn’t expect this from you, 
my child, what was this weird act? If there is a problem or any issue,
then tell me, share it with me, I might be able to help you somehow, hmm? no one can help me. My foundation cannot change. What are you saying, my child? My child, Arooj? What do you mean? 
Don’t say that. Don’t you worry, I won’t harm myself. That is what I expect from you. I am here with you. My child. Greetings, aunt. Greetings. Thank God, Shanzey that you came, now go and talk to your friend, ask her why she made 
this condition of herself. What should I ask her? I know everything. Shanzey, my child, what did you start thinking? Go and talk to her she will definitely 
tell you what is it. Don’t you worry, I will go and 
ask her what is the problem. Thank you, my child.
 Go and ask her, I can’t see her in this condition, 
my heart is sinking. Okay, relax, I will just go 
and ask her right now. Did you talk to Arooj? Did she tell you anything? No, she didn’t tell anything but I have figured it out myself. Figured what? That there is definitely some problem
between the mother and daughter. But how can there be a problem? They are very attached 
to each other. It is just my idea, I have sent Arooj to 
meet her parents, now when she comes back, we will 
get to know what is the matter. Have patience Arooj, we are trying to find out, and we will definitely find a clue. How can I be patient, you don’t know Shanzey, the pain and hell I am going through. Do you know, I have started to feel disgusted 
by myself, who am I? What is my identity? How can someone leave their child? How can any parents get separated
from their child? Unless they want to leave her 
themselves? Now I am in pursuit of no one. Now I am just in pursuit of 
my own existence. Don’t think like that, Arooj, your thoughts will take you 
to the darkness. How can I not think, Shanzey? How should I stop myself? I have started to feel disgusted 
with myself, who am I? What is my identity? Until when will I run from myself? Until when? Arooj, have faith in God. Make yourself strong, 
everything will be fine. I don’t expect such a stupid act 
from you at all. I am sorry, Aunt. I couldn’t understand myself 
what I was doing. My love, it is not important 
what you are doing, what’s more important is 
why are you doing it? I didn’t expect this from you, 
my child, what was this weird act? If there is a problem or any issue, then tell me, share it with me, I might be able to help you 
somehow, hmm? no one can help me. My foundation cannot change. What are you saying, my child? My child, Arooj? What do you mean? 
Don’t say that. Don’t you worry, I won’t harm myself. That is what I expect from you. What does she know? How I had grief equals 
to Mountain on me. They think that I will cause harm to myself 
because of something. What do I even have to ruin? Nothing at all. No one can understand my pain. I am a leaf that has fallen
from the branch, whose fate is merciless, wherever it takes her, that weak leaf cannot do anything to the wind. The drama that Arooj performed today, what did she tell you about it? I asked her but she didn’t give any answer. I am tired of asking her but 
she is not telling anything, is there anyone in this house who can 
ask what has happened to her? No one is there to ask 
anything from her. When you couldn’t find out, I am not anywhere is her list ever. Mom, you cannot leave me alone 
by saying that. I am with you, Salman. If you are with Salman then 
who is with me? I am alone then. Here, her dramas start again, so everyone’s attention is on her. I don’t want anyone’s attention on me, leave me alone,
I want to stay alone. Oh please, stop these filmy dialogues, I want to stay alone,
leave me alone, this is your in-laws’ house, 
not your mother’s house. Arooj? Arooj? This girl has destroyed the peace 
of this house. I don’t know what has happened 
to Arooj, I am unable to understand anything. Here, her dramas start again, so everyone’s attention is on her. Oh please, stop these filmy dialogues, I want to stay alone,
leave me alone, this is your in-laws’ house, 
not your mother’s house. Is this not my mother’s house? But the place where 
I have come from is not my mother’s house either. So where is my mother’s house? Where is that house, where my mother lives? Mom?
