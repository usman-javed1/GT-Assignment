[68.76] Leave my son,
[70.24] leave, come Salman.
[72.08] What? What are you saying
 sister-in-law?
[74.44] I am telling the truth.
[76.76] Salman is my son,
[78.56] I gave birth to him.
[81.84] I gave Salman to you, 
just to save your life.
[93.72] Now I want my Salman back, 
right here, right now!
[106.28] How dare you utter 
such nonsense?
[111.16] You did not do the right 
thing Mehreen!
[114.40] I will do this again and again,
[116.68] if you will do this then 
I will do this again and again.
[120.16] How dare you call 
Salman your son?
[123.08] Because Salman is my son!
[125.20] Aunt, please!
[143.84] It is shocking,
[152.72] how can aunt say such a thing?
[164.44] And how can she put such
 a big claim?
[177.36] There must be some truth 
behind all of this,
[188.76] otherwise aunt would have thought
 before speaking so much.
[199.72] And whatever the matter is,
[208.44] I should know about it.
[248.72] Young ma’am,
[251.48] whatever is happening,
[254.84] this is not right.
[259.24] This was bound to happen Wasai.
[263.48] You are right
[267.12] but it was not supposed to 
happen right now,
[278.16] and it wasn’t supposed to 
happen like this.
[287.68] You know about elder madam’s 
mental condition,
[301.36] this is Madam's trick!
[306.52] What kind of trick?
[310.84] Actually,
[312.60] I am very poor and weak,
[316.48] also, I am just the maid 
of this house,
[329.88] I fear before speaking 
about anything.
[334.40] Don’t worry Wasai,
[337.56] no one is here except you and I,
[341.08] you can say whatever 
you want to say.
[350.68] Actually,
[353.28] Madam wants to remove 
elder ma’am from her way.
[372.12] What do you mean?
[373.16] What I meant is,
[374.84] elder ma’am doesn’t have the strength
 to tolerate any big news,
[385.64] then why was she given this news?
[405.04] Hmm,
[407.40] so God forbid she gets shock and…
[409.72] Yes!
[410.76] Now you understood 
what I meant.
[426.68] So Wasai,
[431.24] what shall we do? 
What should be done now?
[435.96] I cannot do anything,
[438.88] now whatever is to be done,
[440.88] it has to be done by you.
[451.64] You have to handle this matter now.
[532.36] Stop it,
[534.08] what are you saying?
[535.84] It is the truth, I am right!
[538.08] You are really my son…
Salman!
[539.92] Salman, tell her to get lost!
[541.36] Brother Idrees take 
this woman away,
[542.92] otherwise no one will be worst 
then me! Go away!
[549.56] No one is worse than you.
[551.84] It is such a weird thing,
[554.00] no one wants to listen 
to the truth.
[556.44] This is the truth! 
This is the truth!
[558.76] Salman is my son, 
I want my son back.
[561.36] Please! Stop your rubbish and 
get lost from here! Go away!
[563.88] Shaista come, come. Come Shaista. 
Leave my hand! Idrees!
[575.88] Telling this truth so suddenly 
in front of everyone,
[586.08] this woman really wants 
to kill my mother.
[733.04] What is this misbehaviour, huh?
[742.24] What way is this to enter 
someone’s bedroom?
[745.52] I can show you the mirror 
without misbehaving,
[761.64] but you don’t want 
to see the mirror
[764.52] because a mirror never lies.
[769.68] What are you trying to say, huh?
[772.24] What you don’t want to hear.
[775.88] You are continuously 
misbehaving with me.
[778.40] And what you have been doing 
for the past 25 years, what about that?
[786.96] But what you have done now,
[793.04] you will not be forgiven for that!
[796.00] What have I done, huh?
[798.32] What have I done?
[800.84] What you have done?
[803.52] You have tried to kill my mother!
[809.48] I have done no such thing,
[820.36] I only claimed my son as mine!
[828.12] If Mehreen dies after hearing this,
[831.72] then I don’t care.
[833.44] Your intention was to hurt her
[836.80] but nothing happened,
[849.68] but now,
[852.24] now I am between you two!
[859.56] Now I won’t let anything like this 
happen either.
[866.60] Now whatever will happen,
[868.16] you wouldn’t have even 
thought about it.
[878.36] I have no interest in listening 
to your rubbish,
[887.04] and by the way,
[889.16] the ridiculous trick that 
you played with my mother,
[896.28] your intention was to hurt us 
completely,
[899.76] but luckily God was on our side.
[914.60] We were fearing that
[916.24] when mom will come to know 
about all of this,
[919.08] she will get such a big shock.
[930.00] But by God’s grace, 
she survived everything!
[943.20] And you know,
[945.76] whatever she will come 
to know now,
[950.56] it will only be a source 
of happiness for her.
[954.44] Happiness?
[964.52] Means she will find happiness
 in the fact
[967.64] that you are her daughter,
[970.52] her daughter has been found.
[982.24] Arooj, you are so innocent.
[994.12] Nowhere in Mehreen’s mind, 
is there even a single doubt
[997.16] that she had a daughter,
[1011.52] Yeah! there you go.
[1123.68] Salman, where are you going?
[1127.04] I am going to aunt.
[1130.60] Okay, but why?
[1132.68] For clarification,
[1135.00] on what basis did she say
 such a thing?
[1141.16] If this secret gets uncovered then
[1146.08] this shock, will be unbearable 
for both, mom and Salman.
[1163.20] Yes, you can ask about 
this some other time.
[1166.80] She must have said it just 
in the moment.
[1175.88] I already told you that
[1178.92] aunt’s behaviour is really 
changed nowadays.
[1185.32] No Arooj,
[1192.44] there is some truth 
in every rumour,
[1204.00] and I,
[1206.60] I want to know the truth.
[1209.12] Yes, there is some truth,
[1211.40] but you can find out when
it’s revealed, in its own time.
[1214.40] I still want to know.
[1246.44] Can I say something?
Hmm…
[1249.64] Mom’s attitude is changing,
[1252.40] you have made her busy 
in the right way.
[1254.48] Her job is to love,
[1260.36] but she has seen such 
hardships in life
[1264.08] that hardened her attitude.
[1268.44] What kind of hardships?
[1272.44] Right now, I left Areej with her,
[1280.44] rest will get better on its own.
[1284.08] Everything is fine, 
what could get more better?
[1296.16] You will get to know 
everything with time.
[1336.36] Mom!
[1347.68] Hey,
[1349.20] back off,
[1350.80] why are you stuck to me? 
Move back.
[1353.24] Mom
What Mom Mom?
[1355.56] No mom
Hey move back,
[1358.08] why have you glued yourself to me?
I am asking you to move back,
[1361.64] back off,
[1363.92] are you mad?
[1365.52] Why are you repeatedly 
calling me your mom?
[1367.60] I am not your mother.
[1370.72] You fool!
[1422.60] And you know,
[1425.12] whatever she will come 
to know now,
[1430.00] it will only be a source of 
happiness for her.
[1433.84] Happiness?
[1439.64] Means she will find happiness
 in the fact
[1442.72] that you are her daughter,
[1445.56] her daughter has been found.
[1451.68] Arooj, you are so innocent.
[1458.04] Nowhere in Mehreen’s mind, 
is there a single doubt
[1461.04] that she had a daughter,
[1468.04] Yeah! there you go.
[1478.44] Mom doesn’t remember,
[1486.60] that she once had a daughter.
[1494.04] She doesn’t know anything,
[1499.64] and if we make her remember it
[1503.32] then she will go through a huge 
shock connected with her past,
[1516.96] which would turn out to be 
harmful for her.
[1527.84] If mother never comes to know,
[1536.32] then what will happen?
[1543.88] I know that
[1552.28] she is my mother,
[1561.20] but,
[1563.72] but she will never call me 
‘daughter’ and hug me to herself.
[1574.68] Yes but,
[1582.52] but I can hug her
[1591.68] by calling her ‘mom’.
[1621.96] Your intention was to hurt her
[1625.28] but nothing happened,
[1627.96] but now,
[1630.44] now I am between you two!
[1633.08] Now I won’t let anything 
like this happen either.
[1640.08] Now whatever will happen,
[1641.64] you wouldn’t have even 
thought about it.
[1651.84] I have no interest in listening
 to your rubbish,
[1657.72] and by the way,
[1659.68] the ridiculous trick that 
you played with my mother,
[1665.92] your intention was to hurt us 
completely,
[1669.28] but luckily God was on our side.
[1675.76] We were fearing that
[1677.32] when mom will come to know 
about all of this,
[1680.24] she will get such a big shock.
[1683.32] But by God’s grace,
[1684.96] she survived everything!
[1717.48] Salman, son!
[1729.20] What’s wrong son?
[1730.92] You look worried.
[1732.20] Do you want to say something? 
Speak…
[1736.32] I don’t understand from where 
shall I start,
[1744.08] but I want to ask something 
from you.
[1748.52] Ask, I am listening my child.
[1753.84] What was the reason behind 
whatever you said to mom?
[1767.64] Even though you know how 
possessive Mom is for me,
[1770.44] she cannot tolerate such a thing
 even as a joke!
[1777.68] And I don’t know why I am saying
 this to you
[1779.80] because you are aware of 
Mom’s mental health,
[1789.24] then, why did you try to prove this lie
to be a truth in front of her?
[1793.24] This is not a lie son,
[1795.68] this is the truth.
[1804.08] You are not Mehreen’s 
but my son!
[1812.04] Mehreen is not your mother,
[1813.72] I am your mother. 
Enough!
[1824.24] Don’t say anything after this.
[1831.12] This is not a film or drama where 
I will agree to whatever you are saying.
[1835.44] How shall I make you believe
[1838.76] that you are my son,
[1840.88] I am your mother.
[1845.40] No,
[1851.76] I will not believe 
what you are saying,
[1853.40] you are lying, 
this is not the truth.
[1859.04] Idrees, look,
[1864.04] Salman is not believing to the fact 
that we are his parents.
[1885.32] Salman is my son,
[1888.80] I gave birth to him.
[1892.56] I gave Salman to you,
[1897.76] just to save your life.
[1902.24] Now I want my Salman back,
[1905.16] right here, right now!
[1909.56] Oh God!
[1911.52] Oh God!
[1913.24] what kind on voices are these?
[1933.76] How can this happen?
[1937.32] All of it is lie, all of this is a lie,
[1940.12] everyone was wrong, 
it cannot be like this,
[1943.04] it can’t be like this. 
Sister Shaista,
[1945.96] Sister Shaista was lying, 
she was wrong.
[1949.32] How can Salman be her son?
[1953.32] No! No!
[1955.32] All of it must be a lie.
[1957.20] Salman!
[1958.80] Salman!
[1960.36] Salman!
[1985.60] He cannot believe, tell him,
[1988.52] I am his mother and 
you are his father, tell him!
[1993.68] Uncle, she is lying right,
[1995.96] it’s not like that.
[2004.00] Uncle answer me, 
this is a lie right?
[2007.04] No, tell him Idrees, 
tell him I am not lying.
[2013.80] Look son,
[2021.44] now that Shaista has uncovered 
the secret,
[2024.52] then listen carefully,
[2035.52] I am not your uncle,
[2038.64] I am your father
[2060.68] and Shaista is your mother.
