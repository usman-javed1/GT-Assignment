Arooj is in this condition 
because of you. Be quiet, right now. At least tell me. What will you do finding out? What had to happen, 
has happened. Arooj was coming down 
from the stairs, it was dark. Her foot slipped and she fell. 
That’s it. This story is not as easy as 
you told this. Your doubt is absolutely right. Let me get successful once. Let me get rid of this Arooj once. That’s it. But why are you in such a hurry? You made an attempt one or two days,
today, you tried again. Because Arooj has found out a lot. Before she tells Mehreen or
 Salman everything, I want to silence her voice forever or else we will not get anything. You are right. No one will find out, who did it, 
and what happened. Everyone will forget it 
considering it an accident. Exactly. Come on. 
Come. Come on. What is the matter? 
You are smiling a lot. The thing is such. When you hear it, 
you too will smile. Then tell me quickly, because it has been long that 
I have not laughed either. The thing is that we are going 
to Dubai for vacations. Really? Absolutely. So, finally… finally, I will get a chance to breath 
with you in open air. We will get a chance 
to spend time together. Do you know, we live together, but we never got moments
of freedom. But Salman,
I will tell one thing, whether it is Dubai 
or some other country, no business, please. Alright, promise. No business. Do you know Salman, this sea drives me mad. Really? That is a really wrong thing. If such a beautiful wife of mine
goes mad, then what will happen to me? Salman. 
Just kidding. Salman, son, how did all this happen?
 Where is my Arooj? In the operation theatre. Don’t worry, Naseema, 
it will all be fine. Your Arooj is really courageous. Constant hits even break a stone,
 master. My Arooj is like a flower. God will make it fine. Sit. Sister Shaista, 
how is Arooj? Whatever God wills, 
what we can we do? We can pray. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Sit, 
we will pray for her. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, I had come to the hospital.
Actually… Can someone be this cruel? Madam who used to encourage 
younger madam is praying for her to die. She is such a strange woman, she is thinking of cruelty 
against her daughter in law. Wealth makes a person blind that they are unable 
to see any relation. Younger madam’s sorrow is big, in fact, it was big, now it is your turn. God is the King of kings. Yes, doctor, is everything fine? God will make it all fine. There are some complications 
in the delivery. Complications? What complications? Problems? 
What problems? The way in which Arooj fell, 
the baby is fine and that is no less than a miracle. But the problem is related 
to the mother, pray and Mr. Salman, please sign this. We will try our best to save the life
of both mother and child. Yes, but… you just said that the child 
is absolutely fine. Look child, the life of the child is 
connected to the mother’s health. God forbid if something happens 
to the mother, the child’s health is also in danger. This way, we will only be able 
to save one person. Obviously, you will save the child, right? The child’s life is important. He is the child of our Salman. Aunt, what is wrong with you? 
What are you saying? Mr. Salman, you think about it. 
Discuss it. Sign this. But see, you don’t have a lot of time. Sure. Staff, when he signs this, 
inform me. You people come with me. Salman, son, listen to me. 
Come here. Come here. See. You will get other wives too, but this child is your blood, your future generation. What are you saying, aunt? Arooj is fighting between life 
and death there. She loves me so much and 
you want that I tell the doctor to save the child and let her die? I think about the child 
who has not come in the world and the one I have lived 
so much time with, I should leave them. 
I should let them die. No, Salman… Salman is right, 
sister in law, Shaista. If Arooj is important for Salman, then Arooj’s life is important for us. Don’t worry, nothing will happen to Arooj. Sign it. It is such a torture, what sort of a life is this? There is not a single moment 
where I can find peace. It is something disappointing for me, that you don’t get peace with me here. No Salman, I didn’t say that. I have no complaints from you. You are the only one my own and do you know when I talk to you I forget 
all my sorrows, all my pain. Don’t even think that. Whenever I thought, you always proved what I thought 
to be wrong. Stop it, man. Now I feel embarrassed 
what sort of a man am I. No, there is nothing like that. But, do you know, earlier, I used to think that you are not a good man. But then you also proved that wrong. So, then when you felt 
I am a very good man, what happened, then? Then I fell in love with you. But, I was really scared hearing 
about your accident. I was afraid that something 
would happen to you. Madam Naseema, drink water. Drink it. God will make it all fine. Wasai, Arooj has always praised you. You have been her well-wisher 
in her bad days. Younger madam is really 
good herself. Why did Arooj come down 
the stairs in this health? Why did she come downstairs? Were you not present there 
at that time? Now what do I tell you? Salman, son, what did the doctor say? The doctor has given us hope. Nothing will happen to Arooj. May God accept your prayers. Child, my Arooj is my life. Arooj. She is everyone’s life. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. Wasai, what were you saying? Nothing. Mehreen, what are you doing? You have got such a good opportunity
to take out Arooj from Salman’s life, and you made the decision 
in Arooj’s favour? I didn’t make the decision 
in Arooj’s favour, I made it in Salman’s favour, 
sister in law, Shaista. I have no interest in Arooj, apart from the fact that Salman truly loves her a lot and the one who is important 
for Salman, they are also really important for me. Did you not get this thought
a little too late? Till yesterday, you didn’t like 
Arooj at all. And today, you like Salman’s choice. Till now, you too used to take her side a lot, 
sister in law, Shaista. Now what new flaw has come 
in front of you that only you know, and you are hiding it from me. No Mehreen, I was saying it 
because of you… No, sister in law, Shaista, 
not because of me. Anyway, don’t tell me, I will find out. Now will you dance all night long? Hey, it is a night of celebration tonight, so I cannot control my emotions. Control your emotions. Shaista, what is wrong? Let her celebrate. 
You know, happiness has come to Waqar 
and Mehreen after six years. Mama, I was just saying it is so late, so we should start the ceremony. Yes, you are right about that too. Come on, Wasai, bring everything 
for the ceremony. Mama, I have kept everything 
on the table already. Okay children, come lets do 
the ceremony. Come on. Come on. Here you go, cold glass of juice. Hey sister in law, Shaista, 
why did you bother? You should have asked Wasai, 
she would have brought it. Where is Wasai? Wasai was busy in the kitchen. I care about your health, 
so I brought it. Stop Mehreen. Take this. You know what her condition is, in such a situation she shouldn’t 
have anything cold. Wasai. Wasai. Yes, mama, coming. I don’t know where the hell she is. Take this away. Sure. Mehreen, in future you will not eat 
or drink anything without asking me. Do you understand? Why should I tell you, Mehreen? Why should I tell you? She is the same girl who took my Salman’s place 
in your arms. This Arooj is Areej and now she has come to drag us
all out of here. Aunt. 
Yes? What is the matter? What are you thinking 
standing here alone? Prayer. I am making a prayer for Arooj, child. She is such a good girl, God knows whose evil eye affected her. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. Amen. Amen. Wasai. Ouch. 
Ouch. Your wife is really lucky. I think a prayer of yours came
 to help. Arooj is now out of danger, and congratulations to you, God has given you a beautiful daughter. Thank you so much doctor, 
can I meet Arooj? Yes, we are shifting her to the room, 
then you can meet her. Thank you. Come on. Mom, did you hear 
what the doctor said? Arooj is absolutely fine, and you have become a grandmother. Yes. Wasai. Yes, elder madam. Tell the driver to get lots of sweets. My Salman had a daughter. Yes, yes, I will just get it.
