Yes? Is the work done? Sir, we took the mark from close,
but… What if and but? 
What happened? The girl moved from the target 
at the last moment and she didn’t get shot. Stop this nonsense. Did I give you so much money 
to hear you say these things? Sir, give me another chance. I will not make a mistake this time. Hey, is this bird hunting that if you miss the target once, 
you will shoot it again? These things happen in such things,
sir. Don’t get angry. You have no idea 
what you have done and what will happen to me now. 
Cut the call. Oh wow, you kept on calling me stupid and you are planning 
all this yourself? This is correct. If you had to do this, then you should have 
waited a little. You should have done it 
when Arooj was alone. There is no time to wait. But even Salman get 
affected by this. Nothing will happen. 
He is an expert shooter. Nothing will happen. Still, there is no room for mistakes
in such things. You are taking a big risk. Look,  you have patience, and everything is happening 
according to the plan. You have patience. I had to remove this worry 
from my way, another problem has come. You are really naïve, Mehreen and Arooj is really cunning. What is the matter, sister in law? You never spoke like this 
about Arooj before today. What happened now? I made a mistake. I am so sorry. I took long to understand her. I always considered you wrong and I took Arooj’s side. But Mehreen, you were right. Arooj is really cunning. She along with Salman 
wants to take over this home and the entire business. Arooj, you don’t worry, 
I am absolutely fine. You are not fine at all, Salman. You have bled so much. You are fine, 
so everything is fine. Now you will only rest. 
Come on. Will you be able to go upstairs 
comfortably? Salman, what happened? How did you get this wound? 
This is blood, right? Aunty, I will tell you. You be quiet. I am asking, Salman. What happened? 
Tell me. Mom, don’t worry. Two men came on a bike 
and they shot me. They shot you? Okay, come on, don’t worry, 
it is just a minor injury, I am fine. The injury may be minor, but it is nothing ordinary. A murder attempt was made 
on you. Salman, son, what happened? 
How did this happen? Salman, son, is all okay? 
Are you fine? Yes, uncle, I am fine. Actually, two people came 
on a bike and they fired. Thank God, I am fine now. Did you report it to the police? Yes, mom. You did right. 
You did absolutely right. Okay, don’t worry, I am fine. 
Nothing happened. Idrees, get a black goat quickly and 
do charity for my Salman. Yes. Yes. Wasai, go get turmeric milk.
 Go quickly. Sure. Come on. Come inside.
 Come. Come on, son. 
Careful. Are you in pain? Do you have pain?
Don’t worry, I am fine. My son. How is my son? Love. Sister in law, 
how are you? I am fine. Brother Idrees, 
she is really weak. You take her home. No, no, I will stay here with Salman. You are a patient yourself, 
we need healthy people here. You go home. Come on, Shaista. Come. 
Let’s go home. Salman got shot. He got injured. God forbid, had something 
happened, then, I would have faced the biggest loss. Aunt Mehreen’s sorrow is the same. Because she considers herself 
Salman’s mother. And maybe this is why, she is considering me responsible 
for this incident. But sadly, I cannot say anything. Tell me, what did the police say? Mom, I spoke to the SP, he has said that they are investigating and they will catch the criminal soon. Hey, son, don’t get into these matters
of the police. These things happen 
in the city regularly. They must be robbers, they must 
have come to rob you. Yes. Yes, but uncle, they didn’t demand 
any cash from me. They directly fired a bullet. Yes, so the robbers get worried
 and shoot at anyone. He must have escaped 
after shooting. No, aunt. I feel their target was Arooj. On the last moment, she stepped on the side and 
the bullet just grazed me. Or else, God knows... This means the bullet was 
fired at Arooj. Maybe this is what I think, and maybe I was their target. I don’t understand anything. Oh, Idrees, order a black goat and do charity 
for my Salman. Earlier, I only had a doubt, but after what Salman said,
I am sure that you are responsible for 
Salman getting shot. What is my fault in this? Because this bullet was fired at you 
and my Salman came in the way. By the way, tell me something, what amazing feat have you achieved that people are after your life? You mean, someone came to shoot me 
and Salman got shot. That’s what you are saying, right? Yes, that’s exactly what I am saying. Fine. Imagine if I would have really 
gotten shot, and died, then would you have liked it? what happened? How did you get this wound? 
This is blood, right? Aunty, I will tell you. 
You be quiet. I am asking, Salman. What happened? 
Tell me. Mom, don’t worry. Two men came on a bike 
and they shot me. They shot you? Okay, come on, don’t worry, 
it is just a minor injury, I am fine. The injury may be minor, 
but it is nothing ordinary. A murder attempt was 
made on you. Salman, son, what happened? How did this happen? Salman, son, is all okay? 
Are you fine? Yes, uncle, I am fine. Actually, two people came on a bike 
and they fired. What is the matter? Did a new life come in the home or did someone die? I see sorrow written on 
everyone’s face. Mehreen, I am really happy. In fact, all of us are happy. It is just Arooj who stays distant 
from everyone. I will not ask Arooj anything, because the pain 
she has been through, a person get depressed after that. And then, Arooj has given my son 
a big happiness. My son is really happy. If mama finds out that the Arooj, 
that got saved today is her daughter, then all hell will break loose 
in this home. Did you see what you did? This is what you do. This is the limit. You constantly kept on saying 
that I will see, I will see, I will do it. Is this what you did? You didn’t even kill the snake, and the shaft broke and stuck 
in our heart. It was the fault of those shooters, 
what is my fault in that? If my son had gotten injured badly,
then what would I have done? I too am scared thinking 
about Salman. Thank God, that he got a new life. Thank God, but he has filed 
a report with the police, this is something worrisome. So when did they get caught, 
that you are worried. If they get caught, then the police 
will reach the truth. You have no idea. 
So? The SP is Salman’s friend, right? Tell him to stay away from 
this police proceeding. No, Shaista, the time for 
all this has passed. Anything can happen now. 
Anything. You chose amateurs and took 
the danger on your head. It is your fault. Mom, I spoke to the SP. He told me that they are 
investigating and they will catch the criminals soon. They must be robbers, they must 
have come to rob you. Yes. Yes, but uncle, they didn’t demand 
any cash from me. They directly fired a bullet. Yes, so the robbers get worried 
and shoot at anyone. He must have escaped 
after shooting. No, aunt. I feel their target was Arooj. On the last moment, 
she stepped on the side and the bullet just grazed me. Or else, God knows.. Earlier, I only had a doubt, but after what Salman said, 
I am sure that you are responsible 
for Salman getting shot. What is my fault in this? Because this bullet was 
fired at you and my Salman came 
in the way. By the way, tell me something, what amazing feat have 
you achieved that people are after your life? Where is Salman? He must be in aunt Mehreen’s room. Good. He should be where they care 
for him the most. Meaning? Meaning, you turned out to be 
so cunning even unknowingly, that you bowed down 
in front of the bullet and Salman got shot. I didn’t understand one thing. Aunt Mehreen is worried because she is Salman’s mother. But, why are you so worried on 
Salman getting shot? Uncle, I am thinking, how can someone hate someone 
out of love. Hatred out of love, 
I don’t understand anything. Meaning, aunt Shaista loves Salman, and so does aunt Mehreen, but they have a fight between 
them for Salman’s love. Why does this happen? Arooj, child, don’t about this at all. Because this is how it has been going
on since Salman’s childhood. Exactly, that’s what I want to find out, how can a maternal or paternal 
heart love so intensely. The thing is Salman is the only son 
of the home, so this snatching continues in love. What is the matter? You look worried?
Is everything fine? Those two, the problem in our life. What other worry can I have? It is nothing new. But what are you worried about? The AC is on, the room is cold, but still you are sweating. 
Are you feeling okay? I am fine, but there is a worry. What happened now? The police has started to raid places
to find those shooters. So, you tell them to go 
somewhere far. Hey, the police is monitoring 
all the numbers. I don’t understand what I do, I will have to carefully get in touch 
with them from an unknown number. Yes, the situation is really serious. Now, Salman can have 
this proceeding stopped. I will try one more time. Maybe Salman agrees to me. I will come in a bit. This means the bullet was 
fired at Arooj. Maybe this is what I think, and maybe I was their target. I don’t understand anything. Oh, Idrees, order a black goat and 
do charity for my Salman. Mehreen, how is Salman feeling now? He is fine now.
He just slept. Okay, you go and sleep. I will sit with Salman. No, not at all. I don’t need anyone’s help 
to take care of my son.
