Madam, your tea. Yeah, keep it there. Okay. Where is Idrees? In Madam Sr’s room. What is he doing there? he is… He is, actually, I don’t know madam. Wasai, you know everything, did you go to her room? yes. what were they talking about? Umm, they were talking
 about Madam Jr. About Arooj? What were they saying? Maybe Sir doesn’t want Madam Jr to work at the office. Not maybe, Idrees for sure doesn’t want it. Yes. I don’t know why does I
drees has a problem with Arooj going to the office. Mehreen is already negative 
from Arooj’s side, I don’t know what new 
scheme is he planning. Madam Jr is very nice, madam. Do you know when
 she talks to me, I don’t feel like a servant at all. You are right, Arooj has a very nice nature. Okay you may go. Okay. I’ll go check myself
 what is going on there. So what did you guys plan then? Plan? About what? About Arooj? You were talking to Mehreen, right? Who told you? Forget about that just tell me that why
are you after Arooj? After all what did the 
innocent girl do to you? Why are you always 
defending Arooj? Because I don’t have any
 reason to be against her, if you have it then let me know. These are official matters
 so don’t interfere. If I cannot interfere 
in office matters then why do you want
 Mehreen to interfere, it is strange, a woman went to the office and the other woman is being 
informed about every moment, and if the third woman 
asks something, so she is not allowed 
to even talk about it? I don’t have an answer
 to your question. It is a very prominent, Idrees, it is about 2+2=4, how will you answer? Anyways, tell me, what problem do you
 have with Arooj? she is asking about 6.5 million
 marble that where did it go? So then give her the accounts. What do I know where they went? What do you mean? It’s not a needle that
 you wouldn’t know. Salman, Hmm I feel that we should do 
company’s audit. we just got it done 2 months back, it will happen next year now. I am not talking about annual audit, I want to get a special audit done. Why? Is there a problem? I see some miscalculations 
in accounts. They get all the receipts ready by 
the year end and bring it to us, I think the audit should take 
place all of a sudden, that would be better. But Arooj, according to me,
 everything is going on smooth. Salman, I see something wrong with 
the company accounts. Arooj, you are having 
a misunderstanding, doing that creates doubts, the rates of the stock 
market can go down too because people start trusting less. So I think just let it be. As you wish, I was talking for the 
benefit of the company. Come in. Yes, Wasai? What is it? Actually, Madam Sr is calling both of you. Okay tell her we are coming. Okay. Shall we go? Hmm. Come. Yes mom? Did you call us? Yes. I have made a decision. What decision. I will come to the office
 too from tomorrow. She got psycho episode again. Office, but what will you do at the office? Whatever Arooj does there. Mom, Arooj looks after accounts. I will look after something too. Mom, why are you being stubborn? Everyone will make 
fun of me at the office. Really? It’s fine if Arooj goes to the office and if I go it will be a joke, it is logical? Okay fine, tell me what do you want? Just that if Arooj will go to the office, I will go too. Rest is up to you. So then what did you decide? Arooj, I cannot take
 this drama anymore. Why is this drama created at all? What do I know? Things have gotten 
way beyond this question. That’s what happens every time, things get out of our hands. Arooj, I don’t want to debate on it, I will be made a joke at the office. What will people say that the game of mother-in-law and daughter
 in law is being played in my office too? I kind of have an idea
 what you would say but I just want to ask that what will be your decision? Arooj, you know how 
stubborn mom is, I will have to unwillingly
 stop you to stop her. Hmm, it means, my idea was absolutely right. What idea? Anyways, I have aligned interviews for new 
accounts manager tomorrow. I will conduct them. No, I accepted what you said, now you will have to 
accept my decision too. Arooj, my child, 
what are you doing here? Nothing, I felt like breathing in fresh air. Yes, Mehreen is an expert in 
creating suffocation, in relationships, in hearts, in the environment. If it was in her control, she would even stop 
us from breathing. What can I say? She is my elder, it is obligatory for 
me to respect her. Okay fine, then you keep on
 fulfilling your obligation and Mehreen will keep 
on doing her work. Anyway, what does Salman say now? I won’t be going to office 
from tomorrow. Salman has to do all that Mehreen forces her to do. What can the innocent guy do? No one can do anything. Salman is not letting 
you go to the office, I understand that because he is very obedient
 towards Mehreen but I don’t understand the 
fact that why is Idrees after you? You tell me if you
 know something? What can I say? I guess because he might not be understanding 
my way of working. Yes, maybe, he is a man from old generation, he is habitual of 
working his own way. It means you won’t be going 
to the office from tomorrow? Yes, I guess. Madam Sr, I have 
served the breakfast. Call Arooj too. Okay. Leave it, Wasai, you may go, we are coming. As you wish. When she doesn’t have 
to go to the office, she will even have the 
breakfast later on. Come let’s have breakfast. Greetings, aunt. Greetings. It looks like you guys didn’t
 understand what I said. Aunt, we have obeyed your orders. So then why are you dressed
 to go to the office? A person should move on in life, if there is a hinderance on way, one should create a new way. What is she saying, Salman, will you tell me? Is Arooj going to the office? Mom, don’t worry, we have accepted what you said. Come, let’s have breakfast. Where are you taking me, Salman? Come, there is a surprise for you. Surprise, okay? Is this blind fold important for it? Very important. Okay let’s see what your surprise is. Where? Just wait for 2 minutes, you wait will be over. When will your surprise end? Just wait a minute. What is all this? Whose office is this? You cut the ribbon first. welcome to new office, Aunt. Whose office is it? You said that Arooj shouldn’t
 be going to the office, so I brought the office home. This is Arooj’s new office. Mom? Mom? Don’t worry, I will talk to her. Congratulations to you 
on your new office. Welcome to new office, Aunt. Whose office is it? You said that Arooj shouldn’t
 be going to the office, so I brought the office home. This is Arooj’s new office. Madam Sr, your tea? Who asked you to get tea for me? Madam did. Madam asked me to take tea for you. Okay fine, keep it there. Okay. Cleverness with me? Mehreen? Arooj, it will cost you a lot. Let’s see how long this 
office stays intact for. Sister-in-law Shaista, I want to talk to you about 
something very important. Sure, go ahead? You think all this is right? What? That the office has come in home? So what’s wrong in it Mehreen? This is good, it is good for you. Good for you? How? You wanted to go to the office, now the office has come near, so you join the office now. Sister-in-law, I wanted to join
 Salman’s office, this is Arooj’s office. I will never step inside her 
office even with good intentions. It’s not making 
difference to anyone. Coocoo. Madam, the last candidate for accounts
 department is waiting. Send him. Okay. Yes come in. Good morning, ma’am. Good Morning. Ammad? Arooj? You? Oh my God, what a pleasant surprise. Come, sit please. Thank you. You never contacted after university, you disappeared somewhere. Madam, you are the one who is lost, how could have I contacted? By the way, you have achieved what you had to, good. Hmm, I achieved it and you? Won’t you tell me about yourself? A middle class boy is always
 after making his future, we don’t even study to study. College, university, we just
 go there for a good job. The same old style, the same revolutionary talks. Yes, my talks have just been talks, I couldn’t bring the revolution. You can’t even bring it. So where were you for so many
 years? What did you do? I was in the US, I was also studying there and working along with it too now don’t ask what was the work 
that I was doing there. Yes, but I would just tell that 
my clothes still like petrol. Okay so, you didn’t get married. How could have I gotten married
 when you got married? You didn’t stop flirting yet? Come on, I was joking, you are a very good friend of mine. Okay, tell me, will you give me the job after 
conducting the interview or not? Hmm, so, when would you like to join? Ma’am, I am a poor person, I will join you from today if you want. Okay then, you are about to get a special 
task on your first day of job. And I hope you will be
 able to understand it. Work on this file and update me. Thank you. Make me speak to Amna. yes madam? Yes, come to my room. Okay. yes ma’am. Amna, this is Mr. Ammad, manager of our 
Finance Department. Show him his seat and introduce him to the 
rest of the staff too. Okay. Thank you, thank you so much. Good luck. Thank you. I asked you to bring the 
file from the record room and you have come empty handed? Boss, the record room is empty. What do you mean by it’s empty? You will have to check all
 the data on your laptop, all the files have gone home. How did so many things go out of the 
office without my permission? Record keeper was saying it happened 
on Madam Arooj’s orders. I even took your name but he said that Madam Arooj
 is director finance and Mr. Salman has said that 
her orders should be followed. Boss, I got so worried that 
how did it happen? Arooj is very smart. Now she will be sitting at home and reading every line. So let her, we have an answer 
to every question. But we don’t have an answer
 to where did 1000 sq ft marble go. Can you give me anything else
 apart from tensions? Boss, I am your sympathizer, you wanted to get Madam
 Arooj out of the office, she called the office at home itself. Go. Mr. Farhan, what is the 
protocol of all the files of our projects that are uploaded 
on the computer? Madam, you, Mr. Salman and 
Mr. Idrees has access to these files. Okay then only I and Mr. Salman will the
 access to this from now on. Okay, madam. Okay, so warehouse, sales, marketing, change passwords for all of these. Okay madam. And yes, check everyone’ screens 
and share it with me. Okay, I will do as you said. Don’t say you will, do it already, 
Mr. Farhan, right now, got it? Yes, madam, don’t worry. Thank you. I will solve all these 
loopholes at any cost. What happened? 
Why have you made this face? Boss, the space is getting narrower. What has happened? All the files have already
 been taken home, now we cannot even 
check from the computer. Who did this? IT manager sent an email that only Madam Arooj and 
Mr. Salman has an access to it. So then how will we work now? Boss, there are no 
restrictions on new files. The house has become
 so lively today else there is always silence here, people are coming and going, boys with ties, girls, girls are a little too fashionable. Anyway, what do I have to do with it, Madam jr has asked 
me to make tea. Wasai will just make tea. Madam sr, do you need something? So many cups? Who have you made 
so much tea for? Actually, people from Madam
 Jr’s office are here, there are these many people. This Arooj has ruined all 
the discipline of our house. She has ruined the peaceful
 environment of the house. This is our home, let it be a home and
don’t make it an office. Okay, Madam Sr, the tea is done now, I will go give it. I can see that the tea is made. Do one thing, pour it in the sink. What? I am asking you to pour it in the sink, do you understand? yes I am really sorry Uncle, actually there are some issues 
of the marketing department, I was emailing them. Yes, yes, yes, I know, even I gave them 
some advices but that’s not what 
I am here to talk about now. coffee? Hello? Umm, yes send two 
cups of coffee, thank you. Yes, tell me? My son, what is all this? It is such a huge company,
 the name is ours and the entire office is
 being run from home. Uncle, not the entire office, I have just shifted the 
finance department home. And I guess you are
 forgetting that we have ran office from
 home in the lock down days. My child, it was a different problem, it feels unnecessary to me right now, Personal life and office 
should be kept separately. So, what can I do? Mom is being stubborn at 
one place and then there is Arooj’s wish at the other end. And you? Do you have any of your 
own wish or will? I just want both of them to be happy. I don’t mind anything else. What happened uncle, 
what are you thinking? yes, nothing, son, nothing, the coffee hasn’t come yet? Okay did you speak to Ali associations? Yes, I am coordinating with them, I will also arrange a meeting soon and will finalize too. Perfect. Hello? Yes, send the coffee, 
we are waiting. Thank you. So, what’s up Mom? You didn’t come to meet, it has been so long that I haven’t seen your face, a mother cannot resist, so I came here. Everything is in front of you, there is so much work that 
I don’t get any time. My child, you have to take out time
 for your loved ones. Hmm, you are absolutely right but what can I do mom, by the time I get done with office, its night, I don’t get time. By the way, Arooj, why did you need all this? You left such a huge office and made office at home? Because, Aunt Mehreen doesn’t want
 me to go to the office and I don’t want to
 leave this department that is why I had to do all this. What is the reason for all this? And what was so important, my child? I will definitely tell you 
at the right time, don’t worry. You were saying that this is an office. How are you sister Mehreen? This is an office, lower your tone, my staff works here. Not yours, Salman’s staff and if this is an office then why have you made an environment
 like it is your parents’ house?
