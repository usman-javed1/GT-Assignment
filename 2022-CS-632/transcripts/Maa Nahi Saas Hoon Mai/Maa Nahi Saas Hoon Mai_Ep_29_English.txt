On 26th June a payment of three million was 
made to Sasa builders. There is no receiving in the file. There is no update on the system either, neither are any details being 
shown in the accounts. And this is from when Salman 
went to the UK. So, this means he was only made to sign the cheque. If the payment has not reached 
the builder, then, where did the three million rupees go? Oh, this is the reality. Uncle? Hey, come child. Come, Arooj. Come. Come. Have a seat. How is everything going? Really good. Very good. I thought you would get bored 
of this accounting. No, not at all. In fact, the more I get into this work, 
my interest level is increasing. Okay. Uncle, I wanted to ask you something 
about Nawaz. About Nawaz? Yes. 
What? Nawaz works here as an account manager, 
right? So, what sort of a man is he? He is trustworthy. Trustworthy for the company or trustworthy to you? He has been working here 
for a lot of years. The company has no complaints 
towards him. By the way, why are you asking this? Just like that. I was looking deeply in some matters
 of the finance, so I thought I would ask you about it. Okay. Okay. If you feel that Nawaz is not right, we will fire him. No, there is nothing like that. 
I didn’t say that to you. I was just asking. Okay. Will you have coffee?
Huh? Sure. Send two good cups of coffee. Yes, wife of mine, what is it? 
I am in the office. Saira, what is wrong? You know there are six days left 
till I get the salary. Hey, I don’t have money, don’t bother me. I know, I have to pay the fees 
of the children, but where do I get the money from? Cut the call. Such a big fraud has occurred 
in the office, but… looking at Nawaz’s condition, 
I don’t think even he got anything. I feel uncle took everything in his control. The entire expenses of the home, 
to the extent that the company takes care 
of uncle’s car petrol. Then what does uncle do 
with this money? Now I will have to see. When there is corruption 
in one project, then it must be at other places too. Boss, I am really worried. What happened? The fees for both my children has 
not been paid. Boss, I need money. I don’t have money, there is still time 
till we get the salary. Boss, people like us live on the salary. People like you make this money 
from somewhere. Mind what you say, Nawaz. Do you understand? Hello. Yes, madam. I am coming. Madam Arooj is calling me 
to her room. Fine, go. Greetings mama. I am fine, how are you? Nothing, I was in office. 
I was doing some work. You tell me. Yes, yes, everything is fine. Okay, I will call you. Goodbye. Yes, madam. Mr. Nawaz, I wanted to ask you that the salary office pays you, are you able to manage in it? Yes, madam, I am just able to manage. How many children do you have? Two. One son, one daughter. Do they go to school? Yes, madam. How much fee do you pay
for both of them? Eighteen thousand. The expense for the van is separate. Okay. Hello. Sajid Hafeez, Make a cheque of twenty five thousand 
in Mr. Nawaz’s name and get it signed from me right now. 
Thank you. Mr. Nawaz, from today, the office will pay the expense 
of your children’s education. You can leave. Madam. 
Yes? Thank you. Thank you so much. You are welcome. I met her at the brunch of Edhi center. Madam. Madam. Maham, I will call you. 
What happened? Elder madam is doing weird things 
in her room. She looks at one corner of the room 
and scold someone at times, then she gets angry, then she goes to the other side 
and scolds someone. Although no one is in the room. God be kind. I think she had a mental breakdown again. You come with me. I want the account details on 
my table in an hour. I will not hear any excuse. 
Do you understand? Okay. Goodbye. And you people, have you come here as freeloaders? Is this how you work? It won’t work like this. Now I have come here, 
I will deal with all of you. Shut up. You will argue with me? Leave from here. 
Leave immediately. Disloyal people. Salman has hired the biggest lazy people
in his office. They just come to get their salaries. This is how you run an office. No one knows it better than me, and nor can anyone know it. Wasai. Wasai. 
Yes, coming. Yes, elder madam. Tell the driver to take out the car. Sure. Mehreen, where are you going? I am going to the office sister-in-law. What office? Salman’s office? Yes, sister-in-law. But why? When Arooj can go, 
then why can I not go? But Mehreen what will you do 
going to the office? I can do anything, but from today I will go the office daily. Mehreen, if you agree to me, then it is not right 
for you to go to Salman’s office. All his office people will be there. When the business community finds out 
that Salman’s mother has come to the office, so what will they think? Sister-in-law, what is wrong in this? Look, Mehreen, if you argue with Arooj, and you will have it, then the entire noise and commotion will be
heard by the office people. Everyone will find out, 
everyone will see. Salman will get insulted badly. Elder madam, the driver has taken out the car. Say no to him. I am not going anywhere. Yes, as you order. Nawaz, come to my room. Yes, madam. Mr. Nawaz, this is Sasa Builder’s file, 
take it. Madam, did you mark the objections? Nope. I have no objection. Thank you madam. 
Welcome. Look, you are on the top most position 
of your department. This is a big responsibility. Where money is involved people don’t take long to 
become dishonest. Obviously, you will have a lot of people 
under you. Don’t ever trust anyone blindly. Check and balance in really necessary
in monetary transactions. So what did your madam Arooj say? Boss, I was really scared. I couldn’t sleep at night. What did you think? That you will get caught. Not me, us. You too are involved in this. Boss, when do you give me a lot, why are you taking my name? Don’t talk nonsense. Boss, I feel madam doesn’t know 
how to work, or there were no chances of surviving. This will not happen every time, she is really smart. meaning, if we get saved in 
the Sasa builder case, we will get caught in some other case. Say good things, 
whenever you open your mouth. Boss, I am having bad days, 
how will I say good things. After all, you give me more fear 
than the share I get. Okay fine. Fine. 
We will see in future. Really? A little more. Fine, boss, I will see. If you are a little lenient, then, the criminal starts suffering from 
unnecessary self-confidence and he considers the one in front of them 
unaware and stupid, and then, they make a mistake. I too will remain unaware like this. Uncle should get a chance that he makes another mistake. I feel you have a lot of burden of work. Yes, there is burden of work but when your interest increases 
in work, you have fun. This means you are enjoying 
your work. Yes, because you are with me all the time 
and I am with you. Yes, that’s true. But if you ever get bored, 
then tell me. Of what. Of work, what else? Fine, I will tell you. and as far as getting bored of me 
is concerned, that will never happen. Drive the car. Hmmm. Arooj, when will this drama of yours end? What do you mean? What drama, aunty? This… the role of an office going girl that 
you have selected for yourself. Now this drama won’t work. Mehreen, don’t do this. The child is interested for a few days, 
let her fulfill it. This is not an interest brother Idrees, it is something more than that. I understand it all, 
I am not a child. Arooj, please sit down. Arooj, you don’t leave food like this. Come on, sit down and eat your food. I am done eating, aunt. My stomach is full. Arooj. Mehreen, don’t do this. I will make her understand.
I will talk to her. It is good brother Idrees, do make her understand. Everyone have food. But this will ruin the environment of the home,
it will cause ill feeling. But me going to the office, working for the business will lead 
to ill feelings, why? Yes, I understand that, 
Mehreen doesn’t. Yes, but this is the matter of the office and Salman has all the rights to the office. Aunt Mehreen has no involvement in it. You are absolutely right. Mehreen has 
no right on the business, but she has a right on you because 
you are a part of the home. That is why she has made you going 
to the office an issue, and even Salman will get tension 
from this behaviour of Mehreen, then he will argue with you. That is not something right. That is why you save your relation 
with Salman, stop worrying about the business. Meaning, the betterment of the office has 
no importance. Hey, you can hire anyone for that, but no one can take your place at home. 
Understand? Look, I gave you permission to go, and now I am stopping you too. You gave me permission to 
go to the office, the reason was good, but I didn’t understand the reason 
for you saying no. Mom’s refusal is a big reason and you know how important 
she is for me. And me? Am I not important? Arooj, why are you saying these things? You too are really important for me. Why are you making going to the office
 your ego issue? If mom doesn’t understand, 
then you understand. If she doesn’t want that you go 
to the office, then don’t go. Meaning, I have no will, I have no thinking. Arooj, you are taking it wrong. There is nothing like that. I just want that the tension at home ends. Trust me, Salman. I giving you surety, you will feel proud of me one day. You will say yourself, it was a good decision of mine to 
let you work in my company. Trust me Salman. 
I trust you. I trust you a lot. But my mother’s order has more value 
for me than that. Yes, madam?
Have a seat. Mr. Nawaz, how many files do we have 
for the Stone Burry project? Madam, we have just got into 
one contract for marble, the file for which is in front of you. Fine, then as per this contract with Stone Burry, we have given them ten thousand square feet marble, right? Yes, madam, that’s how it is. And the project file, I checked, in this project, Stone Burry has taken nine thousand 
square feet marble. What madam? Yes, that’s how it is. You tell me, where did one thousand 
square feet marble go? Maybe, Mr. Idrees returned it. Maybe? You used a really good word ‘maybe’. So, you too are not sure. You know, Mr. Nawaz, the cost of this marble is 
sixty five hundred thousand rupees. Yes, madam, your calculation 
is absolutely right. So you give me a report 
as soon as possible where the remaining one thousand 
square feet marble go? Yes, madam, I will ask Mr. Idrees 
and let you know. There are a lot of problems, 
do you have any idea? What happened, Nawaz? Madam is inquiring about the one thousand
square feet marble. What did you say? What could I say, boss? 
I stayed quiet. She was constantly asking 
such questions, that I felt all our secrets will be 
out in the open. Fine, I will think of something. 
You go. Sure, boss. Arooj is asking for the accounting 
of every single thing. I will have to do something about 
her interference in the office. Arooj. Where do you feel there is a shortage
in Stone Burry? Tell me. We made a deal of ten thousand 
square feet, and the material delivered in the warehouse
is nine thousand, so where is the remaining one thousand. Hey, you don’t know 
there is wastage in this work, it must have gone in that. Uncle, if there is one percent wastage, still where is the nine hundred square feet. This cannot happen with me here. Uncle, you try and understand.
Look at this. We received the stair steps and tower tiles prepared,
then why the wastage? Come on, give me the file.
I will check it myself. No, I think you check the records 
of the warehouse, the file will stay with me. Okay. Yes, brother Idrees, now you talk freely, why are you so sad? Mehreen, I admit that the business is 
not mine, it belonged to late Waqar. I own nothing. But I have a little respect, right? What happened brother Idrees? You are the elder of this home, 
all of us respect you a lot. Everyone doesn’t respect me, 
that’s what I am crying about. Brother Idrees, you tell me, what has you worried so much? Look Mehreen, Salman is my own, but that new girl, 
your daughter-in-law, Arooj, now will she question me too? Me? Arooj? Did Arooj say something to you? 
I will just question her. No, no, you leave it. 
I don’t want anything like that. It would be better that I leave Salman 
and do a job somewhere else. No brother Idrees, you cannot leave Salman at all. I have left the business matters of Salman, 
with you there. But, my heart is not satisfied, 
I am made to feel humiliation, like I am a burden. I have decided to quit this office. No brother Idrees, you will not leave the office at all. If someone will leave the office, 
then that is Arooj. You please, have tea. Sure.
