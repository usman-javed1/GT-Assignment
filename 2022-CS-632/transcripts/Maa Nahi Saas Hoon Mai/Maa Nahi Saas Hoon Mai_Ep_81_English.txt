You don’t want Salman to know that he is not aunt Mehreen’s son! Because if Salman’s real mother comes
 to know about the gunshot, then the poor woman will come crying
 and screaming to hug her son. And if that happens, then all your plan will be ruined. Anyways, you plan has already been ruined. My baby! My love! My dear, Areej! Come in… My dear! My Areej! Thank you. Here, I will put it down. Wasai, where is Arooj? She is in madam’s room… By the way, there is a good bonding between 
Arooj and Aunt yes… Not there is, there was! Now, there seems to be some 
strain between the two. Really? it’s that serious! Yes, otherwise sister Shaista never
 used to speak so harshly and cruelly for Arooj, right Wasai? Yes, elder Ma’am, 
you are right. My dear! Wasai! Give miss Areej back 
to her mother, here. My dear! It would be best if you left my room right now! Aunt, what is wrong with you? Oh! calm down aunt. Have a seat, 
why are you standing? I have come here 
to have a long chat. Won’t you agree to such a 
small request from your Arooj? Good girl! Okay, I will tell you a story today. I saw a woman, she only had one son and she even gave that son 
to someone else! What kind of rubbish story is this? Listen to what happened ahead, you will find this story really interesting. You know why that woman did all of this? Due to greed for wealth! I have never seen so much greed 
for wealth in someone’s eyes! That vicious woman, who was apparently a mother, but she used to tell everyone that she is doing all of this
for that woman! Otherwise, that woman will 
go crazy and die! And that vicious woman used to make everyone a fool
 by saying all of this. How did you find my story? Rubbish! Completely, rubbish! Oh! Wait, these were just the highlights. I will tell you the real story now. And what is this, you are standing again? Alright, I’ll stand then. I keep thinking, what kind of 
mother’s would they be, if a mother is greedy, then she can be evil as well who didn’t call her son, “Son”, 
for the past 25 years! In fear that she would lose 
the inheritance! No! Mothers are not like that! They are like that! And she is standing 
in front of me. My only point of telling you 
this story is, that I have all your secrets. So giving poison, pushing me down the stairs and firing bullets at me, leave all of this! Nothing will happen 
from all of this. Rest, you are smart, you must have understood. I have started the last round of the war aunt! Now let’s see, who will win… Mom, I have felt that you are much calmer since
 Areej has been born. Yes, it’s exactly that. You know Salman, I feel like I have a very deep and
old connection with Areej, but what is it?... That vicious woman, who was apparently a mother, but she used to tell everyone that she is doing all of this 
for that woman! Otherwise, that woman will 
go crazy and die! And that vicious woman used to make everyone a fool
by saying all of this. How did you find my story? Rubbish! Completely rubbish! Oh! Wait, these were just the highlights. I will tell you the real story now. I keep thinking, what kind of mother’s
would they be, if a mother is greedy, then she can be evil as well who didn’t call her son, “Son”, 
for the past 25 years! In fear that she would lose 
the inheritance! No! Mothers are not like that! They are like that! And she is standing 
in front of me! My only point of telling you 
this story is, that I have all your secrets. So giving poison, pushing me down the stairs and firing bullets at me, leave all of this! Nothing will happen from all of this. What can Arooj do? Afterall, she is my son, 
Salman’s wife. Arooj will have to do whatever Salman will ask her to do and I am Salman’s mother, Mother! Shaista, what is wrong? 
Why are you so angry? Enough Idrees! I cannot tolerate anymore, I will not stop today! Whoever will come in my way today,
I will crush them! Hey! Listen… Is this soothing? Yes, a lot! You know mom, when I come to you, I forget all my problems. My son is, after all, my life. My son is my life. Leave my son, leave, come Salman. What? What are you saying 
sister-in-law? I am telling the truth. Salman is my son, I gave birth to him. I gave Salman to you,
just to save your life. Now I want my Salman back, 
right here, right now! How dare you utter such nonsense? You did not do the right thing Mehreen! I will do this again and again, if you will do this then I will do 
this again and again. How dare you call Salman 
your son? Because Salman is my son! Aunt, please! Stop it, what are you saying? It is the truth, I am right! You are really my son…
Salman! Salman, tell her to get lost! Brother Idrees take 
this woman away, otherwise no one will be 
worse than me! Go away! No one is worse than you. It is such a weird thing, no one wants to listen 
to the truth. This is the truth! 
This is the truth! Salman is my son,
 I want my son back Please! Stop your rubbish and 
get lost from here! Go away! Shaista come, come. Come Shaista.
Leave my hand! Idrees! What happened to her! 
Had she gone mad? What rubbish was she saying? How was she calling you her son? 
How can she call you her son? Doesn’t she know that 
you are only my son? Tell me, had she gone mad?
 My Salman… Mom, Please relax, 
nothing happened. How everyone is trying to take 
away my Salman from me! No one is taking me 
away from you. I am here with you, 
nothing happened. Nothing happened!
No, Salman is my son. How come you remembered
my room today? You are always found in 
your mother-in-law’s room. She is not my mother-in-law, she is my mother. You know this very well, and I have come to know 
about this as well. So? Quickly, now go and tell this to Salman 
and Mehreen, go! Salman! Nothing happened mom. 
I am here with you! He is my son, no one else! Everyone tries to claim their right. Okay, I will tell you a story today. I saw a woman, she only had one son and she had given that son 
to someone else! What kind of rubbish story is this? Listen to what happened ahead, you will find this story 
really interesting. You know why that 
woman did all of this? Due to greed for wealth! I have never seen so much greed 
for wealth in someone’s eyes! Leave! Leave my hand! You have gone mad Shaista, 
you should accept it. I have not gone mad, Mehreen has gone mad! And the time has come 
to treat her brain, I will set her right! By doing this, it will ruin 25 years plan.
Have you thought about that? I don’t care. Now I don’t care 
even more! Let me tell you one more thing, whatever you are thinking, 
nothing will be destroyed! What nonsense are you uttering? How can there be an earthquake
 and no damage? Whether the coin falls straight 
or opposite, the win will be mine, only mine! How will that happen? Whose son is Salman? He is our son. And whom does all of 
this belong to? It is all in Salman’s name. Exactly, Salman is our son, 
and he will remain our son. Which means all of this 
is ours as well. Do you understand 
what I’m saying? How and in what way will Salman 
accept all of this? Now, you need to wait, wait for when my son Salman, will call me ‘mother’. What happened, has a new life come 
into this house or did someone die here? I see sorrow on everyone’s face. Mehreen, I am really happy. In fact, we are all happy. It is just Arooj who is staying 
away from everyone. I will not ask Arooj anything, because the pain 
she went through, after that a person does suffer
from depression. And Arooj has given 
my son a big gift. My son is really happy.
