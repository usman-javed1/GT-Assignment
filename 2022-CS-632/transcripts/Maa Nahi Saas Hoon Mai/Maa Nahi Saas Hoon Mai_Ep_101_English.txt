Dad? Arooj, my child, come here,
we are sitting here. Greetings. Come, come. Greetings. Sister Mehreen is here too? Come, come, sit down. Sit. Arooj, my child, come, 
you come here. Arooj, all of a sudden? You didn’t even inform us 
before coming. We would have told you had 
we known anything. Arooj, my child is everything okay? Dad, actually, Sister Mehreen, you tell me, what is it? is everything okay? Umm, actually, we have left that home. Left home? What happened, Arooj? There was no place left for us to 
live in that environment of hatred. Mom was very scared that it could be dangerous to my life 
and Areej’s if we live there. Okay, this is your own home, you and Arooj are 
completely safe here. Both of you get easy, 
I will get food for you. Come, Arooj my child, sit. Arooj my child, sit. Both of you get comfortable and then tell me the details. God will make everything fine and give her to me. Oh, wow, wow, she is sleeping 
peacefully today. Areej? Wasai? This luggage and bag? Where are you going? Yes, Madam, I am going back to my village. Okay, when will you come back? no madam, I won’t come back now. Why? Madam, I have been working here for years, now I don’t even remember when I came here for the first time. Mom and Sir kept me here then Sir left and Mom left too and I started looking 
after Madam Sr. All that is fine but what happened now? Now that Madam Sr 
is also not here so what will I do here? Okay so are trying to say that I have 
no value in front of you? No madam, don’t say that, we are servants, we don’t have any value. okay okay enough, don’t play with words, keep your bags back you are 
not going anywhere. I apologize, Madam, I have to go. I cannot live here now. Rethink Wasai, you will regret your decision, anyway, you can come back if needed,
 and I will hire you. Thank you so much. What is it, sister Naseema? Do you want to say something? Sister Mehreen, our house is in front of you, it is not as comfortable 
as your mansion, I apologize in advance 
for any discomfort. what are you saying, 
sister Naseema? Stop embarrassing me. Richness and poverty 
are useless things, I am very guilty of you, I can never pay back for 
your favor all my life. We haven’t done any favors 
on you. The way you have raised 
my Arooj so well, and provided her with 
higher education, I can never pay back for this favor
you have done to me. it's not a favor, Arooj was our daughter too. She wasn’t, she is still your daughter, and she will always be yours. You have boosted my pride 
by saying this. Have tea. Yes. We are so fortunate to find 
people like you and a son in law like Salman. We never had a son but we have got a son now 
in the shape of a son in law. Listen Salman is just your son in law, 
that’s it, don’t even try to consider him 
your son. Like a daughter in law is a daughter, Similarly, a son in law is a son. You have a very strange thinking, I will not tolerate any such thing 
regarding Salman ever again. Salman is just my son, do you guys understand? Greetings. Greetings, how are you? I am absolutely fine. Salman will be absolutely fine, don’t worry. Yes I know Salman will 
get absolutely well because his mother’s prayers 
are with him. Indeed, there is a lot of power 
in the prayers of a mother. Yes, a mother’s prayers act like a wall 
in front of the curse sent by someone. its not a curse, sister Mehreen, it was just a coincidence. Sister Naseema, I am so worried right now so I don’t want to get 
into such things. oh God! These people are so grounded and I humiliated them. forgive me, forgive me. what happened, 
what are you looking for? Arooj the file you were signing was
in the room and now I cannot find it. Yes, yes, so what? Where did the file go? I signed them. But one paper was left. So bring it, 
I will sign it right now. How will you sign, 
I am unable to find it. I have looked in the whole house,
its nowhere. So it's our own home, it must be 
here somewhere, you will find it. By the way I never so you so desperate 
for anything ever before. Now you understand how you were
made the heir of the entire property and business after 
Arooj went missing? I will go mad. No. You don’t have to get mad, 
you need to act very sanely. Arooj is a very clever girl, she is also the heir to the entire 
business and property. But she is my wife. She is Mehreen’s daughter, now that the reality is 
in front of you, don’t expect anything good 
from Mehreen as well, and Arooj will stand with her 
mother in this situation. You are a liar! Not just a liar, you can fake love too. Arooj. Lower your tone. You pretended to fake love me, you falsely apologized to Mom and now, you will give up your life 
for your daughter? I am sure you are lying 
about this too. What did you think?
 Yeah? What did you think? 
That I won’t find out anything? I have read all those papers, 
Salman. Arooj raised her hand on me, on Salman Waqar, and then she left from there 
like nothing happened. How did I tolerate all that? Nothing happened,
nothing happened, what happened?
What happened? That’s it, that’s it. Did Mom’s fever come down? Yes it has lowered, I have given her medicines 
and put her to sleep. Mom she has been crying for 
so long, she is not getting quiet. That’s it, that’s it, what happened. my child, she will get quiet and you wait and watch all your 
problem will end too one day. I am not worried, Mom, 
I am scared. Problems are a part of home, Arooj. A lot happens in homes 
and ends too. Just pray that everything 
gets well, Mom. Salman, come sit, son. You are in so much peace, I am not liking it at all. The slap you had put 
across my face, you will find the marks of it 
on your existence. She is my daughter. 
Salman, my child, sit down. Leave her. 
And I won’t let you raise her. I am asking you to leave her. 
Give her to me. Leave her. What is this noise? Don’t do this, Salman. She is my daughter leave her. 
I won’t give her to you. Salman? This is Salman’s voice, but why is he screaming like this? It is my Salman. She is my daughter and I won’t let you raise her. My child, you shouldn’t do this. We can sit and talk, come. The time to sit and talk has gone. Leave her, I cannot live without her. Why can’t you? Didn’t you live without your mother? She is my daughter 
she will live with me. You can’t do this. Salman, 
stop, Salman? Mom, stop him. Salman? Salman? Mom, stop him. Salman. Mom? he took her. Mom, he took Areej. Mom, stop Slaman do something. We will bring her back, 
we will bring Areej back. Mom, stop him, please. You come sit here. 
He took her away. He took Areej. What had to happen, 
what had to pass, it passed, there is no need to pull me back
to my past, Aunt Mehreen. Aunt? You called me an Aunt? Yes I did and I will say it again too, you all, especially you, destroyed my life, just to save your life, you took 
all my childhood away from me. Salman? 
Go away. Go away from me. You don’t have to come 
in front of me again. Salman? you have found your daughter,
right? Save these emotions for her. I cannot do anything, 
my daughter, your mother is helpless. Forgive me. that is not my Salman, he is not my Salman. I don’t know what I lacked
in raising him. He cannot be my Salman at all. Forgive me I cannot get you what’s your right
even if I want to.
