I am amazed by you, Arooj. You turned out to be so cunning 
at such a young age. You didn’t like what I said? You shouldn’t like it either, even I want that. Aunty, I am working. It must be really difficult to work alone. Now that boy is not there either… what is his name? He has a smart name. Ammad. If you are done talking, 
then can I complete my work? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. You know what, Arooj? I used to think that I am the only 
smart one in this world. But you turned out to be more 
cunning than me, Arooj. You fired that Ammad and you made that poor thing resign? I didn’t fire him. He resigned from the job himself
 and went. If it was in my hands, 
I would never have fired him. No matter, what the method, now that boy will not stay 
in this office. Do you have any idea that a helpless man quit his job 
because of your stubbornness. That boy Ammad, is a really good boy, Arooj. Injustice has been done for him. Why don’t you do anything for him? Yes, aunt, and I am unable to do whatever 
I can do for him. How will he get his mother such 
an expensive treatment? What can I say aunt? You can help him, right, child? He believes in hard work and not help. God forbid, if something happens 
to his mother, then? That’s what I am worried about, aunt. God forbid if something happens, then? Okay tell me, did you forward the email to 
Hamdan association? Yes, sir. Okay, perfect. Excuse me. Yes, mom? How are you, Salman? I am fine. Salman, you always think that 
I don’t like Arooj at all. But my love, today I feel really sorry for Arooj. Mom, I don’t understand. When will you come from office? Come a little early. Mom, what happened? All okay? Yes, everything is fine. Arooj is a little worried. She is depression. I think she is really sad about Ammad 
leaving like this, suddenly. Hello, Salman? Are you listening? Yes, I heard it. Okay come on, you do your work and come a little early in the evening. Ammad, it is fine now. You take care of aunty, I will go myself. You know, thank you. Thank you so much that you came.
Even mama liked it. What is there to thank me for? I had to meet aunty anyway, and it is good I asked how she was. You know, I too wanted to thank you. Thank you to me? 
What for? You sacrificed your job and 
saved Arooj’s home. Man, you have to sacrifice in friendship, or else what use is the relation. Relation? Even Arooj and brother Salman 
had a relation, but they don’t have any sacrifice
in their relationship, nor is there any tolerance. You are right. But I don’t want to interfere in 
Arooj’s personal life. Even mama told me not to interfere 
in the matters of a woman a lot. So, I did the same in Arooj’s matter, so that Salman doesn’t have 
a problem. Ammad, you made a big sacrifice 
and you will see, God will bless you for it. Okay leave it, do tell me if you want to do anything. What use can you be to me?
You do one thing, till I am unemployed, then come 
to meet me daily. You will not learn, right? Okay, I came to meet you short on time, but next time I will come with some time,
 then we will sit comfortably. Till then take care of your mama. Thank you. Okay, I will go now. Goodbye. Shanzay, you? How are you? I am absolutely fine. You tell me, 
how are you? Absolutely fine. Surprise. After Ammad left your work load 
would have increased a lot, right? Yes. The work has increased
but no issues. I will manage. Hmmmm. You are right. The void formed by someone 
leaving gets filled. Did you meet him? Yes, I met him. Is he fine? He is fine. But his mother is not doing that good. Yes, and I don’t understand how he will get his mother treated. You are his friend, well-wisher, but your family issues got resolved 
with him leaving, right? That is good. But I don’t understand one thing, he really needed a job. He resigned and left? Arooj, he had found out about you 
and brother Salman, so he left. What? But who told him? I had told him. Oh my God. 
Shanzay, are you stupid?
Why did you tell him? Arooj he will find a job anywhere, but your family issues couldn’t have 
been sorted. Hey, I would have handled Salman, but you shouldn’t have worried him 
telling him about it. Man, I did what I thought was right 
at that time. I am really sorry for that poor thing. Arooj, a friend sacrifices for a friend. I was telling him,
Salman loves me a lot, and what would he be thinking about me
 finding out all this? Arooj, your family issues are 
more important than all this, okay? Okay, now leave all this. 
I will go now, I have to go get medication for mama. Have coffee. Next time. Right now I have to go. Okay. 
Okay? Take care of yourself,
we will meet later. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Hello. How are you Ammad? I am absolutely fine. You tell me, how are you? How is Mr. Salman and the matters
 of the accounts. Yes, it is all fine. You sound really happy to me 
quitting the job. You know me, I always stay happy. Yes, I knew you well, but now I feel I know you much better. Good. By the way, what have you found out about me? The reason why you quit the job? Man, I thought I was not fit 
for the job, so I quit it. Just shut up, Ammad, you don’t look good lying. I don’t look good? Okay, good, I shouldn’t look good either. Be careful, I am an eastern boy. Okay, stop it. Don’t change the topic. Shanzay told me why you left 
the job and went. That damned Shanzay told you 
everything? Yes. You know I am thankful to Shanzay that she told me everything honestly or else I was unknowingly becoming 
the reason to add poison to your lives. By the way, I shouldn’t ask because I know 
what you will say, but fine, I will still ask you. Will you rejoin the office? You yourself are saying 
you know my answer, still you are asking me? Thanks. You are really stubborn. Okay, best of luck. 
Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye. Arooj is a little worried. She is depression. I think she is really sad about Ammad 
leaving like this, suddenly. You took long to come. Was there a lot of work in the office? Yes, there was a lot of work in the office. Yes, after all, now Ammad is not there so you must have to do all the work. Yes, I am having difficulty in work, but okay,
 at least you are happy. So, are you not happy? Are you sad? I am sad that he found out about the cheapness 
of our small talk. He is my friend. He quit the job for my sake. He saved my home. There is nothing like that. You are thinking wrong. He was a really smart man, he knew he would get caught, 
that is why he left himself. You know what? You are insulting me now. What do you think there was 
something between us, and he would have gotten caught, 
that’s why… it is really disappointing. There is nothing like that. After all, you really sympathize with him, I can see that. Yes, I do sympathize with his ill mother, who is a cancer patient. Really? Then he made a big mistake by resigning. If we would have fired him, then at least 
we would have given me a month’s salary, it would have helped him. Actually, not everything is business. Some things are beyond simple addition. If you want, I can help him. His mother will get treated. Huh? You, will help him? Hah, thank you so much. Kindly clear his dues soon. That poor thing needs money. You will help him. So, how are you Salman’s mama? That I am. But you didn’t do good with Salman. You are saying the same thing again?
I didn’t do anything with Salman, what I did was with that cunning Arooj. What do you think? Did that action of yours 
not affect Salman? He got so worried. What did you get out of this? Ammad got fired, he was dangerous 
for the company. and the drama you had created 
against Arooj, that was not successful. You have only humiliated that innocent 
child Arooj in this entire game. This is an allegation on me. Whatever I did was for the best 
interest of the company. Arooj didn’t have good intentions. Don’t forget Idrees, the coin of humiliation you spin
in the market, it comes back to you one day. But why are you saying this to me? I wish you were as innocent 
as you pose to be. Even you are not innocent, 
I will remind you. The truth cannot hide because of 
the things you are saying. You will have to answer for the injustice
 you did with Arooj. Yes, greetings. 
Greetings. I want to meet Mr. Salman. Your good name. Ammad. Okay, I will call him. Hello. 
Sir, sir Ammad is here. You had asked me to inform you 
when he comes. Yes, send him in. Okay sir. Come with me. 
Sure. Sir, Mr. Ammad is here. Okay, you can leave. Okay listen. 
Yes? Send two cups of coffee. 
Okay, Sir. Come. Have a seat. Yes, sir, go ahead. I had to clear a few dues of yours. Sir, this is the job of the account officer, I will go there. Yes, but I called them to me. I wanted that I meet you one last time. Thank you. Thank you, sir. So, tell me, how do you feel leaving our office? Sir, you tell me what you want 
to hear and enjoy, I will say that. Leave it. No, I will tell you. I need a job, but it is true that your company 
needs me right now. This will be proved to you 
as time passes. We will find someone better than you 
when the time comes. I am good at recognizing people. Sir, thousands of people would be 
better than me, and as far as your claims of recognizing 
people is concerned, this is not proven, 
you have to prove it. Okay, we will also see this. Well, these are your pending dues. Keep it. And this is a cheque for 
five hundred thousand for your mother’s treatment. Sir, I am happy that you thought 
about my mother, but I am so sorry, 
I cannot take this. Keep it. It will come in use. Sir, I told you, I cannot take this. And yes, your claim to recognizing people 
is not correct. Thank you. Sir greetings. Greetings, Nawaz. Sir, I have worked with you, if I have made a mistake, 
please forgive me. You are a really good man. When is a man good, his work, 
his character is good. Sir, whatever happened was wrong. One good thing has happened, you got a cheque for five hundred thousand. 
I got it made. Yes, I left that cheque on 
Mr. Salman’s table. You left a cheque worth 
five hundred thousand, what sort of a man are you? Sarwat, what do I tell you 
what problems I am in nowadays, and the issues I am facing. But, don’t worry, 
I will fix everything soon… I will talk to you later. 
Yes, yes, fine. Anyway, sir, my prayers are with you. I pray that you get a really good job. Sir, if you want me to do something, 
then let me know. I will stay in contact with you.
Sure Nawaz. Thank you. He left a cheque of five hundred thousand. Wow. Send Nawaz inside to me. Yes, right now. Yes, boss, you called? Yes. You were really sharing secrets 
with Ammad. Huh? Boss, what secret would I share. I was sympathizing with him, that injustice
has been done with him. Okay, okay, then you must have also 
cursed the ones who did injustice with him. Boss, that is not needed, 
it is done automatically. He is the enemy of the company, 
and you are sympathizing with him? No, boss, I was just trying 
to take benefit that maybe he will go to a good office,
then he will also call me. Why? Is this not a good place? It is a good place, but I always 
have a fear of being fired. You know you are really farsighted 
you know. Yes, sir, I have gone through so much, I have become farsighted. Okay fine, leave now. Don’t drive me mad. You always say 
something like this. Leave. 
Yes, boss. Farsighted. Yes, that’s fine. Fine, send it, I am waiting. Okay. Okay, bye. Hey come on, now you don’t get time to come 
to your mother. There is nothing like that mom. You know, I am so caught up in business tension. Yes, but your biggest tension is over. You are at peace. Which one? That boy Ammad. He left, right? It is good. I have made a really big mistake. Mistake? What mistake? That Ammad. He was not a bad boy. I feel all of us made a really big mistake. If he was not a bad boy, then was Arooj wrong? I don’t know. You are saying, that I am wrong. The one who saw everything 
with her eyes, then… Yes, but you didn’t see anything else. What is wrong, Salman? 
What do you want to say? I am sure Arooj said this to you. Mom, no one told me this. I am just saying that 
he was a good boy. I am the one who had a 
misunderstanding. And Arooj? I think she is not wrong. Ammad came to the office today to get the cheque for his dues. I even offered to help him, 
but he refused. I am saying something to you. I am talking to you, why are you 
not answering me? You have full right to think 
what you want, who can stop you? So, you can at least behave properly. At least answer what I am asking. I don’t even want to discuss the topic 
I don’t want to talk about. Arooj.
