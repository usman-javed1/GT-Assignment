[25.32] They are not my guests.
[49.96] They are uncle’s guests.
[100.92] Aunt, meet her,
[104.04] she too is my aunt.
[138.64] Uncle’s second wife.
[161.16] Mussarat Idrees Ahmad.
[305.68] My friend’s father told me.
[308.12] He told me that there is a family
[309.84] who had lost their daughter twenty four 
to twenty five years back.
[313.24] I feel you can be that daughter.
[316.24] And?
[317.52] What else did they tell you? 
Speak up.
[322.68] Where was she born? 
Who are those people?
[325.00] What was her name?
[326.44] They must have told you 
something more too.
[331.12] I don’t know all this,
[333.52] we can find out 
when we meet them.
[335.76] Yes, so when will we meet them?
[337.72] We are going to meet them 
tomorrow in the morning.
[341.28] Morning?
[346.04] We will meet them in the morning?
[352.64] Salman, why can we not meet
 them right now?
[364.68] Are you going to the office?
[367.12] And where is Arooj going, 
dressed up?
[372.88] Yes, I had some work out of city,
 so I thought I would pick Arooj,
[379.68] she too will have an outing.
[384.28] Okay,
[386.04] then I too will come along 
with you people.
[388.88] I have not been on 
an outing for long.
[399.20] Mehreen, you surprise me.
[401.56] We are not of the age 
to go for outings.
[404.00] If the children feel like going, 
then let them go.
[407.88] But sister-in-law, Shaista…
[409.48] Mehreen, please.
[411.56] You people go ahead children. 
Enjoy. Go.
[415.20] Goodbye.
[416.24] Goodbye.  
Goodbye.
[449.76] I had told you 
I would tell you myself,
[455.28] but you had promised me that
[458.60] you will help me in finding
 my parents.
[463.84] Forgive me, thinking it was 
my mistake.
[469.36] How can you be so stone hearted?
[472.84] She loves you so much.
[474.92] You know, she has not slept 
for two nights.
[477.16] So, what do I do?
[480.64] I have not taken up the responsibility 
of showing mercy on someone.
[483.76] Salman.
[487.88] She is not someone.
[493.40] She has loved you for 
twenty five years.
[498.72] She is your mother,
[501.08] and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen.
[538.84] What? What is this drama, Arooj?
[542.36] You are in no position to ask 
any questions, uncle.
[552.64] Right now, you let aunt and aunt 
talk with each other, okay?
[584.16] Mama,
[586.04] it was time for our breakfast, right?
[595.72] But the drama is so good,
[599.40] that we will have breakfast later.
What do you think?
[632.84] So, Mr. Idrees,
[637.80] is this your Islamabad.
[657.56] You are living here in Karachi,
[661.24] and I am ruined here in this city.
[684.44] Idrees, who is this woman?
[698.96] I am asking you,
[701.08] who is she and what nonsense is
 she speaking?
[714.68] Idrees has no other lie 
to speak now.
[729.84] I will tell you.
[735.88] I am Idrees’ wife.
[742.56] And we have been married 
for fourteen years.
[791.44] Fourteen years?
[810.56] Idrees, what is she saying?
[819.44] Answer me.
[820.96] She is talking about marriage.
[824.40] Hey, I don’t know this woman 
and who she is.
[827.64] Really?
[829.00] Then you wouldn’t even 
recognize your son
[843.64] and you wouldn’t recognize 
this ring either.
[882.04] Hey, stop it. 
You are constantly talking.
[884.68] Do you not care about 
right or wrong.
[886.64] Shaista, I don’t know 
what she is saying.
[889.48] I don’t know.
[902.48] I will lie about such a big thing?
[908.32] Okay enough. 
One second.
[910.96] One second.
[927.72] This allegation that 
you are putting,
[934.92] do you have any proof of this?
[962.00] Proof?
[963.48] Mama, Areej is crying.
[967.92] Yes, I will go and check.
[1026.96] Wasai,
[1028.52] bring two cups of tea to the room.
[1031.20] Sure.
[1047.40] Yes,
[1049.00] so tell me,
[1050.92] do you have proof,
[1064.04] that whatever you are saying
is true.
[1067.48] Why are you quiet? Speak up.
[1069.96] The only proof a woman has
is her wedding.
[1079.96] Our wedding is proof of this,
[1082.52] and I have the wedding papers.
[1156.52] What did you do, Arooj?
[1168.48] What did I do, mama?
[1171.00] Don’t act naïve, Arooj.
[1173.24] I am talking about brother Idree’s 
second wife.
[1184.60] I just wanted to get 
a woman her right,
[1188.56] that’s why I did all this.
[1208.88] You did good, Arooj.
[1218.52] This woman should surely 
get her right.
[1224.56] But you just didn’t do this much, Arooj.
[1228.80] You have guessed it right, mama.
[1238.24] But it was necessary to do this,
[1241.88] because uncle Idrees was not from
 amongst those who would learn.
[1246.20] What did brother Idrees do?
[1248.36] Tell me Arooj.
[1249.92] If someone has given pain 
to my daughter,
[1252.24] then I will fix him myself.
[1255.32] Mama,
[1257.24] you, Salman and Areej,
[1260.52] you are my complete world.
[1272.20] But uncle and aunt
[1275.56] want to take out Salman from 
this complete world of mine,
[1280.20] and make everything incomplete.
[1290.04] I am like you.
[1293.24] Like you show your right on relations,
[1301.80] just like that I too want that
[1305.20] the relations attached to me, 
just stay attached to me.
[1313.44] I know sister-in-law, Shaista well.
[1322.68] She is a really conspiring 
and envious woman.
[1336.04] Honestly, Arooj,
[1339.04] you are someone who keeps 
the home together.
[1348.52] But, Arooj,
[1351.76] whatever is happening there, 
what will be the result of that?
[1358.12] Only God knows this.
[1370.24] But right now we will be 
safe from them.
[1374.68] You are right.
[1377.76] You are absolutely right.
[1395.68] Did you not have shame keeping 
relations with a married man?
[1408.36] Not relation, marriage.
[1411.88] You are lying.
[1418.44] You have put a crack in my home.
[1426.36] I didn’t know.
[1428.92] Idrees told me that 
he divorced his wife,
[1431.88] he is single.
[1454.32] And you believed him?
[1457.32] If a man cries and asks 
a woman for sympathy,
[1471.24] then the woman becomes helpless.
[1477.88] I thought there is a man troubled 
by circumstances,
[1481.80] a worn-out person, 
who needs support.
[1486.16] What?
[1488.20] He is still left to be worn-out.
[1502.52] First, let me deal with the other 
deceivers in the home.
[1545.52] You…
[1546.44] from where did you come 
in the home? Get out.
[1548.52] No. No. Idrees. 
Come on, get out. Come on.
[1550.64] Idrees, I won’t go. Idrees. No. 
Come on. Come on.
[1552.80] Leave me. 
Come on, go out.
[1557.56] Stop mama,
[1560.92] you don’t need to go anywhere.
[1576.48] It is their own issue,
[1578.36] they will sort it out 
amongst themselves.
[1591.96] You will not go between 
these people at all.
[1649.04] Idrees, leave me. 
Come on.
[1650.76] Idrees, leave me. 
Leave me.
[1653.24] Listen to me, I am still telling you 
to go from here.
[1655.64] Where do I go?
[1656.56] The same home I bought for you, 
where else?
[1658.20] I will come meet you.
[1659.68] I am present here, 
meet me over here.
[1661.96] Why are you insisting? 
We are living a good life.
[1664.92] We?
[1665.96] Not we. Only you and 
your first wife.
[1669.20] I have been put on the side.
[1671.28] I am telling you I will fix everything.
Believe me.
[1673.72] Enough. 
That’s it, Idrees.
[1675.56] I don’t believe your lies 
and false promises.
[1679.60] I want respect of our relation 
in the society.
[1682.40] Hey, so you announced it. 
Stop it. Leave now.
[1684.88] Why should I go?
[1686.80] I will not go from here.
I am your wife
[1689.48] and I want the right of being your wife.
[1691.68] Wife?
[1693.16] Will you live your life quietly or else,
you will suffer all your life.
[1695.96] You will not be able to prove that
we have been married.
[1700.12] I doubted your actions earlier,
[1703.28] but I thought that no,
[1705.08] you are unable to take out time 
because of being busy at work.
[1708.76] But when you ignored our son,
[1711.32] that’s when I was sure
[1713.48] that something is surely wrong.
For this day,
[1716.56] I had already taken out 
our wedding papers.
[1720.72] Look, you are not understanding.
[1723.28] You are listening to that Arooj.
She is using you,
[1725.64] so that she can take away 
all the wealth.
[1727.64] Don’t you want that me, you 
and our child live a happy life.
[1731.48] You want it or not? You want it, right?
[1733.80] Yes, go from here. 
No one will go anywhere.
[1736.44] I was telling her to leave from here.
[1738.40] She should leave immediately.
[1747.60] Idrees, you come inside.
[1766.28] For God’s sake, leave.
[1768.24] Leave. I will come meet you. Go.
[1773.52] Come on, son.
[1826.40] Yes, mom?
[1828.24] Salman, son,
[1829.72] you come home immediately.
[1832.40] Why? What happened? 
Is all okay?
[1835.32] It is not okay.
[1837.64] Come and see with your own eyes
what your father has done.
[1844.44] What do you mean? Hello.
[1873.64] I have asked them to come inside.
[1881.64] They are not my guests.
[1886.20] They are uncle’s guests.
[1901.32] Aunt, meet her,
[1904.20] she too is my aunt.
[1912.40] Uncle’s second wife.
[1924.00] Mussarat Idrees Ahmad.
[1970.56] So, Mr. Idrees,
[1972.76] is this your Islamabad.
[1980.60] You are living here in Karachi,
[1984.28] and I am ruined here in this city.
[1994.16] Idrees, who is this woman?
[1999.32] I am asking you,
[2001.28] who is she and what nonsense 
is she speaking?
[2007.52] Idrees has no other lie 
to speak now.
[2016.20] I will tell you.
[2020.36] I am Idree’s wife.
[2028.72] You didn’t do good, Idrees.
[2044.00] Let Salman come home once,
[2051.76] he will teach you a lesson.
[2062.36] God damn it.
[2067.64] Did you not have shame 
lying to two women?
[2075.72] You turned out to be a
black goat.
