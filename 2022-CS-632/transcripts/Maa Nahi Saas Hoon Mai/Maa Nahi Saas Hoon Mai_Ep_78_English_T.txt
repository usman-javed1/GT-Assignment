[64.52] Yes?
[65.72] Is the work done?
[66.80] Sir, we took the mark from close,
but…
[70.36] What if and but? 
What happened?
[72.12] The girl moved from the target 
at the last moment
[74.64] and she didn’t get shot.
[79.96] Stop this nonsense.
[81.16] Did I give you so much money 
to hear you say these things?
[84.16] Sir, give me another chance.
[86.08] I will not make a mistake this time.
[87.84] Hey, is this bird hunting
[89.68] that if you miss the target once, 
you will shoot it again?
[91.80] These things happen in such things,
sir. Don’t get angry.
[95.76] You have no idea 
what you have done
[97.84] and what will happen to me now. 
Cut the call.
[119.12] Oh wow,
[121.08] you kept on calling me stupid
[123.48] and you are planning 
all this yourself?
[129.88] This is correct.
[131.80] If you had to do this,
[133.84] then you should have 
waited a little.
[137.60] You should have done it 
when Arooj was alone.
[142.28] There is no time to wait.
[145.24] But even Salman get 
affected by this.
[149.04] Nothing will happen. 
He is an expert shooter.
[151.68] Nothing will happen.
[154.16] Still, there is no room for mistakes
in such things.
[157.92] You are taking a big risk.
[159.40] Look,  you have patience,
[161.12] and everything is happening 
according to the plan.
[163.72] You have patience.
[174.44] I had to remove this worry 
from my way,
[178.76] another problem has come.
[275.52] You are really naïve, Mehreen
[278.08] and Arooj is really cunning.
[283.68] What is the matter, sister in law?
[286.04] You never spoke like this 
about Arooj before today.
[290.96] What happened now?
[292.32] I made a mistake.
[294.48] I am so sorry.
[296.52] I took long to understand her.
[300.40] I always considered you wrong
[303.64] and I took Arooj’s side.
[309.32] But Mehreen, you were right.
[313.04] Arooj is really cunning.
[316.72] She along with Salman 
wants to take over
[320.88] this home and the entire business.
[348.68] Arooj, you don’t worry, 
I am absolutely fine.
[351.64] You are not fine at all, Salman.
[353.76] You have bled so much.
[356.96] You are fine, 
so everything is fine.
[359.36] Now you will only rest. 
Come on.
[376.80] Will you be able to go upstairs 
comfortably?
[384.56] Salman,
[388.76] what happened?
[390.16] How did you get this wound? 
This is blood, right?
[393.16] Aunty, I will tell you.
[394.36] You be quiet.
[395.84] I am asking, Salman.
[397.64] What happened? 
Tell me.
[398.76] Mom, don’t worry.
[401.52] Two men came on a bike 
and they shot me.
[404.84] They shot you?
[407.28] Okay, come on, don’t worry, 
it is just a minor injury, I am fine.
[410.56] The injury may be minor,
[412.52] but it is nothing ordinary.
[414.68] A murder attempt was made 
on you.
[416.40] Salman,
[418.20] son, what happened? 
How did this happen?
[420.56] Salman, son, is all okay? 
Are you fine?
[423.12] Yes, uncle, I am fine.
[425.24] Actually, two people came 
on a bike and they fired.
[440.12] Thank God, I am fine now.
[441.84] Did you report it to the police?
[444.28] Yes, mom.
[454.88] You did right. 
You did absolutely right.
[457.52] Okay, don’t worry, I am fine. 
Nothing happened.
[462.24] Idrees,
[463.60] get a black goat quickly and 
do charity for my Salman.
[466.88] Yes. Yes.
[467.88] Wasai, go get turmeric milk.
 Go quickly.
[471.12] Sure.
[473.20] Come on. Come inside.
 Come.
[474.88] Come on, son. 
Careful.
[477.48] Are you in pain?
[479.04] Do you have pain?
Don’t worry, I am fine.
[500.12] My son.
[502.20] How is my son?
[505.36] Love.
[545.80] Sister in law, 
how are you?
[550.92] I am fine.
[553.52] Brother Idrees, 
she is really weak.
[556.40] You take her home.
[559.28] No, no, I will stay here with Salman.
[566.20] You are a patient yourself, 
we need healthy people here.
[570.16] You go home.
[575.44] Come on, Shaista. Come. 
Let’s go home.
[696.12] Salman got shot.
[701.56] He got injured.
[707.36] God forbid, had something 
happened, then,
[715.04] I would have faced the biggest loss.
[724.36] Aunt Mehreen’s sorrow is the same.
[734.60] Because she considers herself 
Salman’s mother.
[744.60] And maybe this is why,
[752.12] she is considering me responsible 
for this incident.
[761.00] But sadly,
[766.68] I cannot say anything.
[781.80] Tell me, what did the police say?
[787.48] Mom, I spoke to the SP,
[807.84] he has said that they are investigating
[811.20] and they will catch the criminal soon.
[819.28] Hey, son, don’t get into these matters
of the police.
[822.32] These things happen 
in the city regularly.
[824.08] They must be robbers, they must 
have come to rob you. Yes.
[826.36] Yes, but uncle, they didn’t demand 
any cash from me.
[839.64] They directly fired a bullet.
[841.40] Yes, so the robbers get worried
 and shoot at anyone.
[846.16] He must have escaped 
after shooting.
[849.32] No, aunt.
[857.80] I feel their target was Arooj.
[875.04] On the last moment,
[879.60] she stepped on the side and 
the bullet just grazed me.
[882.80] Or else, God knows...
[895.56] This means the bullet was 
fired at Arooj.
[917.56] Maybe this is what I think,
[921.08] and maybe I was their target.
[941.60] I don’t understand anything.
[957.68] Oh,
[960.84] Idrees,
[962.28] order a black goat and do charity 
for my Salman.
[1022.76] Earlier, I only had a doubt,
[1025.44] but after what Salman said,
I am sure
[1028.36] that you are responsible for 
Salman getting shot.
[1054.80] What is my fault in this?
[1056.76] Because this bullet was fired at you 
and my Salman came in the way.
[1067.32] By the way, tell me something,
[1069.24] what amazing feat have you achieved
[1071.48] that people are after your life?
[1076.40] You mean,
[1079.68] someone came to shoot me 
and Salman got shot.
[1084.20] That’s what you are saying, right?
[1088.20] Yes,
[1089.72] that’s exactly what I am saying.
[1092.84] Fine.
[1096.20] Imagine if I would have really 
gotten shot, and died,
[1100.96] then would you have liked it?
[1171.24] what happened?
[1172.44] How did you get this wound? 
This is blood, right?
[1175.52] Aunty, I will tell you. 
You be quiet.
[1177.96] I am asking, Salman.
[1179.92] What happened? 
Tell me.
[1181.12] Mom, don’t worry.
[1183.84] Two men came on a bike 
and they shot me.
[1187.20] They shot you?
[1189.56] Okay, come on, don’t worry, 
it is just a minor injury, I am fine.
[1192.84] The injury may be minor, 
but it is nothing ordinary.
[1196.72] A murder attempt was 
made on you.
[1198.76] Salman, son, what happened?
[1201.68] How did this happen?
[1203.12] Salman, son, is all okay? 
Are you fine?
[1205.36] Yes, uncle, I am fine.
[1207.48] Actually,
[1208.88] two people came on a bike 
and they fired.
[1221.80] What is the matter?
[1224.80] Did a new life come in the home or
[1228.32] did someone die?
[1236.08] I see sorrow written on 
everyone’s face.
[1240.92] Mehreen, I am really happy.
[1243.80] In fact, all of us are happy.
[1252.32] It is just Arooj who stays distant 
from everyone.
[1262.72] I will not ask Arooj anything,
[1265.84] because the pain 
she has been through,
[1268.28] a person get depressed after that.
[1271.80] And then,
[1272.92] Arooj has given my son 
a big happiness.
[1276.28] My son is really happy.
[1289.60] If mama finds out that the Arooj, 
that got saved today
[1298.36] is her daughter,
[1304.68] then all hell will break loose 
in this home.
[1389.64] Did you see what you did?
[1392.36] This is what you do.
[1395.52] This is the limit.
[1397.56] You constantly kept on saying 
that I will see, I will see,
[1400.64] I will do it.
[1402.40] Is this what you did?
[1405.40] You didn’t even kill the snake,
[1407.24] and the shaft broke and stuck 
in our heart.
[1411.44] It was the fault of those shooters, 
what is my fault in that?
[1414.80] If my son had gotten injured badly,
then what would I have done?
[1418.84] I too am scared thinking 
about Salman.
[1421.68] Thank God,
[1423.92] that he got a new life.
[1426.40] Thank God, but he has filed 
a report with the police,
[1429.72] this is something worrisome.
[1431.72] So when did they get caught, 
that you are worried.
[1434.44] If they get caught, then the police 
will reach the truth.
[1436.96] You have no idea. 
So?
[1439.44] The SP is Salman’s friend, right?
[1442.08] Tell him to stay away from 
this police proceeding.
[1447.36] No, Shaista, the time for 
all this has passed.
[1449.88] Anything can happen now. 
Anything.
[1452.72] You chose amateurs and took 
the danger on your head.
[1457.88] It is your fault.
[1477.76] Mom, I spoke to the SP.
[1481.28] He told me that they are 
investigating and
[1484.76] they will catch the criminals soon.
[1488.00] They must be robbers, they must 
have come to rob you. Yes.
[1490.44] Yes, but uncle, they didn’t demand 
any cash from me.
[1497.80] They directly fired a bullet.
[1499.52] Yes, so the robbers get worried 
and shoot at anyone.
[1504.28] He must have escaped 
after shooting.
[1507.44] No, aunt.
[1512.88] I feel their target was Arooj.
[1523.60] On the last moment, 
she stepped on the side
[1528.40] and the bullet just grazed me.
[1531.52] Or else, God knows..
[1556.00] Earlier, I only had a doubt,
[1558.64] but after what Salman said, 
I am sure
[1561.24] that you are responsible 
for Salman getting shot.
[1565.28] What is my fault in this?
[1567.32] Because this bullet was 
fired at you
[1570.76] and my Salman came 
in the way.
[1574.36] By the way, tell me something,
[1576.28] what amazing feat have 
you achieved
[1578.52] that people are after your life?
[1605.12] Where is Salman?
[1608.16] He must be in aunt Mehreen’s room.
[1612.36] Good.
[1614.00] He should be where they care 
for him the most.
[1619.36] Meaning?
[1621.12] Meaning, you turned out to be 
so cunning even unknowingly,
[1625.68] that you bowed down 
in front of the bullet
[1627.64] and Salman got shot.
[1648.88] I didn’t understand one thing.
[1651.68] Aunt Mehreen is worried
[1654.88] because she is Salman’s mother.
[1662.08] But,
[1664.68] why are you so worried on 
Salman getting shot?
[1700.80] Uncle, I am thinking,
[1703.48] how can someone hate someone 
out of love.
[1708.60] Hatred out of love, 
I don’t understand anything.
[1713.04] Meaning,
[1715.12] aunt Shaista loves Salman,
[1717.84] and so does aunt Mehreen,
[1720.40] but they have a fight between 
them for Salman’s love.
[1727.80] Why does this happen?
[1731.12] Arooj, child, don’t about this at all.
[1733.60] Because this is how it has been going
on since Salman’s childhood.
[1737.16] Exactly, that’s what I want to find out,
[1740.68] how can a maternal or paternal 
heart love so intensely.
[1748.56] The thing is Salman is the only son 
of the home,
[1751.96] so this snatching continues in love.
[1824.52] What is the matter? You look worried?
Is everything fine?
[1831.60] Those two,
[1834.36] the problem in our life.
[1837.44] What other worry can I have?
[1850.48] It is nothing new.
[1853.84] But what are you worried about?
[1872.56] The AC is on, the room is cold,
[1875.20] but still you are sweating. 
Are you feeling okay?
[1878.60] I am fine, but there is a worry.
[1881.96] What happened now?
[1884.28] The police has started to raid places
to find those shooters.
[1889.64] So, you tell them to go 
somewhere far.
[1894.76] Hey, the police is monitoring 
all the numbers.
[1898.00] I don’t understand what I do,
[1899.48] I will have to carefully get in touch 
with them from an unknown number.
[1907.12] Yes, the situation is really serious.
[1920.72] Now, Salman can have 
this proceeding stopped.
[1927.20] I will try one more time.
[1933.80] Maybe Salman agrees to me.
[1947.60] I will come in a bit.
[1966.80] This means the bullet was 
fired at Arooj.
[1979.64] Maybe this is what I think,
[1983.12] and maybe I was their target.
[1994.56] I don’t understand anything.
[2004.28] Oh,
[2007.60] Idrees,
[2009.04] order a black goat and 
do charity for my Salman.
[2076.28] Mehreen,
[2078.08] how is Salman feeling now?
[2081.20] He is fine now.
He just slept.
[2101.92] Okay, you go and sleep.
[2104.52] I will sit with Salman.
[2107.68] No,
[2109.00] not at all.
[2116.20] I don’t need anyone’s help 
to take care of my son.
