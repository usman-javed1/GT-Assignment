Now your madam Arooj 
is done for, Wasai. I will start searching for 
my parents again. And you will see, I will make sure I find them. Now won’t you get me sweets 
on this happy occasion? Hmmm…I will. But right now we have cake. 
Won’t cake be enough? Now the camel has come 
under the mountain. Arooj. I am surprised. I feel you are unable to sleep 
out of happiness for your win. Happiness for what win, aunty? I am a girl who has lost. You deliver these filmy dialogues
in front of Salman. I will not be affected by your tears. I am not shedding these tears for you, I am shedding them for me. Another dialogue. I know well about the innocence hiding
behind this face of yours, Arooj. Then teach me all this as well. How do you read the faces of people? You have finally come. I was waiting for you. Yes, I went to the doctor. Did I ask you? But no, I need to ask you. Where did you come from? I told you, I went to the doctor. Hey, no, who are you and where did you come 
in our home from? I have asked you this. I don’t understand. I will tell you. You are an abandoned girl. No one knows who her parents are. This was the entire thing. Who told you all this? You. But you didn’t tell me this, I heard it myself. And it is good that I heard it or else my son would have lived his whole life 
in the misunderstanding that madam Arooj is the child 
if really respectable and good people. But now the tables have been turned. No one knows who is Arooj the child of. Aunty, you are not speaking good. I am just speaking. You just don’t find it good. But yes, you don’t worry, I will not tell anyone anything. Because you are the respect of this home, my daughter in law and 
my Salman’s wife. But if you don’t remain Salman’s wife, and that you surely won’t remain, then I will tell everyone that thank God we got rid of an abandoned girl. It is my fault. Aunt Mehreen found out 
because of my negligence. So much tension. I am going to be a mother. I will not be able to tolerate 
so much stress. Oh God, what has happened. What do I do? I will have to inform Salman. Yes, Arooj. Go ahead. Salman. Salman, I am really scared. Scared? Scared of what? When I just came to my room, aunt Mehreen was already sitting there. What is there to worry in this? She has found out that I am a lost girl, and no one knows about my parents. What? How did mom find out? What do we do now, Salman? I am sure, aunt Mehreen is going 
to create a big scene at home. You please come home quickly. Don’t worry. 
I am coming immediately. Okay. I just need one help from you. Whether I am lost or 
my parents are lost, no one should find out about this. Because if aunt Mehreen finds out, then she will ruin my life or she will find another excuse 
to get us divorced. Arooj, please believe me. In future, no excuse or reality will not force me to take such decisions. Who told you? Mehreen. And you believed her? So why should I not believe her? I had asked Arooj, 
she didn’t have an answer. This means, there is truth in this. 
Meaning, Arooj is not Master Shoaib and 
Naseema’s daughter? And you see, those people fulfilled the complete 
responsibility of being parents. They didn’t let us have any doubts. Shaista, doubt? Now I am sure. Sure about what? That only an abandoned girl 
can do the things that Arooj has done at home 
and in the business. Idrees, I don’t know what you are saying. Right now, I am worried thinking how Mehreen will treat Arooj. Oh wow, my heart is really happy. It feels like it rained after 
extreme hot weather. I should surely share this happiness 
with someone. Who? Who? Who? 
Yes. Yes. How can you accept that 
your wife is an abandoned girl? When she is my wife, 
then how can she be abandoned? And what hell has broken loose? Children are adopted as well, and they are also brought up
 in orphanages. So, don’t they get married and 
even if they get married, then does their past ruin 
their future? So, you are refusing to 
accept my order? There is nothing like that. I am just talking about what is just. And if you think that what I am saying
is going against your order, then fine, I will apologize for this. Why does this boy not understand? God knows what parents’ blood 
is this girl? Abandoned. You are an abandoned girl. No one knows who her parents are. I heard this myself and it is good I heard it, or else, my son would have spent his entire life 
in this misunderstanding that madam Arooj is the child 
of really respectable and good people. But, now the tables have been turned. No one knows who is Arooj the child of. Aunty, you are not speaking good. I am just speaking. You just don’t find it good. When she is my wife, then 
how can she be abandoned? And what hell has broken loose? Children are adopted as well, and they are also brought up 
in orphanages. So, don’t they get married and 
even if they get married, then does their past ruin their future? So, you are refusing to 
accept my order? There is nothing like that. I am just talking about what is just. And if you think that what I am saying
is going against your order, then fine, I will apologize for this. Arooj is going to become a mother, she still hasn’t become one yet. But Salman is giving so much 
importance to Arooj, that even after hearing 
something so big, he is not surprised, nor does he feel any shame. How is this possible? We don’t know about the parents 
of Salman’s wife, and Salman doesn’t care. The girl who doesn’t know of 
her parents will give Salman a heir. Salman’s family will be ruined. Wasai. Where did she go? She is not even in the kitchen, 
nor is she here. My medication is with her. Wasai. Who is this girl with aunt Mehreen? Yes. Yes. You will get your money on the first. Don’t call me daily and bother me. I don’t have so much money that I send it to you daily. Wasai. Wasai. Put the phone down. Younger madam is in my quarter? Coming, younger madam. What is Arooj doing in Wasai’s quarter? I will go and see. I apologize, younger madam. My husband called, so I got late in talking to him 
on the phone. Who is this girl with aunt Mehreen,
 Wasai? As far as I feel, this is uncle Waqar, but this girl… who is this girl? Where is this girl now? What did I ask you that you are 
not answering me, Wasai? Tell me, I am asking you something. That… that… Wasai. Wasai. Yes, elder madam. What are you doing here? Aunty, I came to look for Wasai. She was not even in the kitchen, so I thought she would be here. 
She has my medication. Give them to me, Wasai. 
Sure. Wasai, what did madam Arooj 
come to do here? What is going on between you two? No, no, elder madam, you are mistaken. Her medicine was left here. I was talking to my husband, so I forgot. She came to get it. You too need to get treated Wasai. Wasai, did you throw that frame? Yes, madam, I threw it outside. Yes, don’t take it home. It has termites on it. No, no, madam, you know I don’t take anything 
from here to my home. I did as you told me. Fine, you can leave. We found you wrapped 
in these clothes and this bracelet was also 
in your hands. Areej. My name was Areej. What sort of coincidence is this? Both the bracelets are identical. And both have Areej written on them. But where is that child, who is in 
aunt Mehreen’s arms, now? Arooj. 
Yes? What thoughts are you lost in? You have your medicine in your hands 
and you didn’t eat your medicine. What are you waiting for? And maybe you are forgetting, the doctor has instructed that 
you don’t have to think. Come on, quickly take 
your medication, I will go get fresh. I get to see and hear 
something new, daily. But a person can only think.
