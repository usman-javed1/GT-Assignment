[22.00] Wasai.
[24.84] Wasai.
[26.04] Coming, younger madam.
[29.28] Yes?
[31.60] Areej is sleeping, 
stay with her.
[33.56] I will just come. 
Don’t leave her alone.
[36.36] Yes, yes, you can go.
[55.96] Madam, Areej,
[58.28] you did great.
[61.24] You came back to this home.
[65.68] Should I tell you something 
interesting?
[69.20] Elder madam considers herself 
your paternal grandma,
[79.40] although she is your 
maternal grandma,
[83.56] and your grandma…
[111.08] If I ask you to do something, 
then you are unable to do it.
[120.84] And you are sitting here and 
taking care of Arooj’s daughter.
[125.28] I serve everyone.
[139.28] Then why talk about younger
 and elder.
[144.76] Go and bring tea for me. 
I have a headache. Leave.
[149.00] I will make it in a little while.
[153.24] What do you mean you will 
make it in a little while?
[154.76] Go and make it right now.
[166.96] Right now, I am with Areej.
[170.04] I cannot go right now.
[172.92] Why can you not go?
[174.80] Leave her for a while, 
she is not going anywhere.
[183.32] No one will eat her. 
Go and make tea.
[188.32] I apologize, madam.
[195.76] Younger madam made me 
sit next to Areej.
[213.88] Till she doesn’t come,
[216.92] I cannot leave madam Areej alone 
and go.
[221.80] You have learned to argue a lot.
[231.84] I know well,
[233.56] because of whom you are arguing.
[242.72] I will teach everyone a lesson.
[259.88] and this was your paternal grandma.
[412.92] What sort of helplessness is this?
[419.44] Mama,
[424.12] you get fine soon.
[436.24] Have courage.
[442.80] Right now,
[446.56] you have to find out a lot
[470.16] and I will make you remember 
everything.
[478.72] Just
[484.36] support me a little.
[502.24] I want to hug you.
[514.48] Now I cannot wait any longer, mama.
[529.64] I cannot wait.
[571.92] Arooj.
[576.28] Yes?
[577.88] What are you doing here? 
I was looking for you in the room.
[582.76] Yes,
[585.80] I came to check on aunty.
[598.20] Come on, let’s go. 
Mom will get disturbed.
[665.80] Today, everything is similar to 
how it happened earlier.
[672.56] For example, 
what happened earlier?
[677.44] You forget.
[683.64] Don’t you remember,
[685.76] when Waqar had a daughter.
[692.12] And now Salman had a daughter.
[697.60] Even then a similar party 
was organized.
[702.56] People from the office came,
[705.16] they celebrated.
[710.88] And even today, 
the same thing is happening.
[714.60] Yes, and even then you were not happy
on the birth of that child, Areej
[718.20] and even today you are not happy
on the arrival of this child.
[730.40] Go and bring tea for me.
I have a headache. Leave.
[734.52] I will make it in a little while.
[738.80] What do you mean you will 
make it in a little while?
[740.28] Go and make it right now.
[742.28] Right now, I am with Areej.
[745.40] I cannot go right now.
[748.32] Why can you not go?
[750.16] Leave her for a while, 
she is not going anywhere.
[755.92] No one will eat her. 
Go and make tea.
[760.92] I apologize, madam.
[765.88] Younger madam made me 
sit next to Areej.
[776.48] Till she doesn’t come,
[779.52] I cannot leave madam Areej 
alone and go.
[808.76] Arooj. 
Yes?
[820.84] Where are you going?
[822.88] To the room.
[826.08] Come on, let’s sit in the open air 
for a while.
[842.24] Now such a time has come,
[844.32] that if you tell the servants of the home 
for some work,
[848.16] they have so much courage, 
they say no to your face.
[858.12] What happened aunt?
[872.12] I had asked Wasai to make 
a cup of tea for me.
[881.76] She said no to my face.
[883.16] She said that I am taking 
care of Areej.
[889.08] I had asked Wasai to stay with Areej.
[892.08] Why the surveillance at home?
[894.68] Could she not have left her 
for two minutes?
[896.40] Not at all.
[898.92] Why?
[906.92] At times, we are more insecure inside
the home, than outside.
[924.84] So you have to keep an eye.
[965.12] Salman, did you see?
[974.56] Aunt’s behavior towards me 
has become so weird.
[982.08] Even I don’t understand myself,
[985.16] although she herself loves you a lot.
[989.12] But she doesn’t love my daughter.
[1000.60] What do you mean?
[1002.72] Why would she be unhappy 
with Areej’s arrival?
[1012.20] Leave it.
[1013.28] No, if you had to finish it, 
then why did you start?
[1016.12] Tell me.
[1018.88] Because I just wanted to see
[1021.52] if you saw this behaviour 
of aunt or not?
[1036.64] Hmmm. 
Come on.
[1110.60] Don’t worry,
[1113.24] everything will be fine.
[1208.52] We have named her, Areej
[1219.52] and we want that
[1221.60] you make Areej wear this bracelet.
[1228.56] Yes.
[1230.56] Salman, hold her.
[1232.08] Careful, till then I will make her 
wear her gift.
[1257.76] What is the matter, mom?
[1259.44] Salman.
[1277.48] Are you fine? Mom.
[1282.40] Mom.
[1286.28] Aunty, are you fine?
[1288.04] Mom.
[1291.04] Mom.
[1293.00] Mom, wake up.
[1295.40] Wasai, tell the driver 
to take out the car.
[1313.52] What are you looking at?
[1316.56] I am seeing how I strengthen 
the feet and roots
[1322.40] of my enemy in this home.
[1332.20] So strong,
[1334.96] that we have no worth of our own.
[1351.68] Why are you admitting defeat 
before time?
[1356.80] I cannot deny what my eyes see.
[1369.72] After the birth of the child
[1373.56] Arooj has been able to make 
her place in this home.
[1380.16] She has turned out to be so cunning.
[1387.68] What did she name her daughter?
[1390.44] Areej.
[1403.00] Slowly and gradually she wants 
to take over everything.
[1413.48] And for us,
[1416.28] the danger is increasing with 
every passing moment.
[1419.72] You are right.
[1424.56] Where are you going?
[1426.68] Nowhere, I am coming.
[1428.20] Shaista, I am scared of you.
[1430.88] Don’t do anything out of emotions,
[1432.96] that things become easy for Arooj.
[1436.44] I have become emotional Idrees.
[1442.68] But don’t worry, I am not stupid.
[1450.76] I will come.
[1552.68] I am really happy that
[1556.84] the distances between you and 
mom have reduced.
[1564.24] What did the doctor say?
[1567.52] There is nothing to worry about.
[1574.72] But they have said that nothing 
that gives mom stress
[1578.24] should be said in front of her.
[1591.36] But I don’t understand,
[1594.08] if it was a happy occasion, 
then why did mom take stress?
[1604.08] Did someone say something?
[1607.52] No.
[1608.84] Nothing like that happened.
[1613.52] Tell me something.
[1623.16] You knew mom really liked 
the name Areej, right?
[1641.68] No.
[1642.84] Not at all.
[1652.60] Why?
[1654.00] Is that true?
[1655.64] No, once uncle mentioned it to me.
[1659.76] Just like that.
[1662.92] I chose this name,
[1666.04] because I thought Arooj and 
Areej are similar.
[1671.04] Yes,
[1672.44] I felt the same thing.
[1679.36] I don’t know, then.
[1684.52] Shall we go to Areej?
[1686.52] You left her alone?
[1689.60] No, no, Wasai is with her.
[1776.64] You were so small Arooj,
[1783.20] when I made a failed attempt 
to get rid of you.
[1791.16] But what I will do now,
[1796.24] the result of it will be success.
[1801.84] Now neither Arooj,
[1806.44] nor Areej will survive.
[1872.12] Did Arooj tell you to take care of her
[1876.48] or to keep an eye on me?
[1879.28] No, nothing like that.
[1887.92] You are being loyal to a 
child born recently?
[1893.84] We have been together for years, 
Wasai.
[1898.16] Have you forgotten that? 
Huh?
[1908.92] Wasai, I didn’t expect you 
to be disloyal like this.
[1919.36] Very bad.
[1952.28] Wasai, it is your duty,
[1955.00] you have to take care 
of the child with Arooj.
[1962.12] There should be no carelessness.
[1965.28] I have to support, 
younger madam,
[1968.56] that’s what you said, right?
[1972.36] Yes,
[1974.24] she is Salman’s daughter, 
that is why I am asking you
[1978.16] and then Arooj too had an accident,
[1981.72] take care of her too.
[1984.36] Don’t worry.
[1986.92] I will do what you order me.
[1990.88] If you don’t mind,
[1993.40] then can I say something?
[1995.36] Yes, go ahead.
[2000.04] Madam’s demeanor…
[2004.68] Yes,
[2007.16] I understand what you are 
trying to say.
[2016.08] I too see that sister in law 
Shaista’s behaviour has changed.
[2023.68] Wasai,
[2025.68] you keep both your eyes 
and ears open.
[2081.88] Come on.
[2083.00] You sit, I will go check on Areej.
[2163.24] Wasai, why did aunt come here?
[2173.92] I don’t know.
