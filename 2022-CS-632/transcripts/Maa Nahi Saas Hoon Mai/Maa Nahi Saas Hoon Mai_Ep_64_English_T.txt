[87.80] Who is this girl with aunt Mehreen, 
Wasai?
[94.68] As far as I feel,
[98.40] this is uncle Waqar,
[101.84] but this girl…
[105.28] who is this girl?
[108.96] Where is this girl now?
[116.96] What did I ask you that you are 
not answering me, Wasai?
[121.36] Tell me, I am asking you something.
[134.96] I have such bad luck.
[143.56] This picture travelled to 
so many places,
[152.36] and came to me
[159.84] and younger madam came 
and saw it.
[169.88] I have served this home 
for thirty years.
[179.72] What will happen now?
[186.36] Little madam will
[191.76] start questioning me
[198.04] as soon as it is morning.
[206.20] What will I tell her?
[212.24] Should I tell her the truth?
[218.60] That this girl was elder madam’s 
daughter,
[227.16] who had gotten lost.
[233.68] Or maybe she died.
[241.28] No, no,
[246.52] all this…no,
[250.24] I will not tell her anything more
[260.56] or else…
[262.44] or else, madam will kill me.
[270.32] I should run away from here, 
as soon as it is morning.
[276.32] Yes,
[278.40] I will run away.
[413.88] What is this Wasai?
[417.56] A relative of mine passed away.
[421.60] Please Wasai, don’t lie.
[429.04] You don’t have answers for 
my questions,
[431.56] that is why you are running away 
from me, right?
[439.64] Fine,
[441.92] you don’t want to tell me, right? 
Don’t tell me.
[446.60] I will get the answer for all these 
questions from aunty and aunt Mehreen.
[451.28] No, no, younger madam,
[453.92] don’t ask them.
[456.60] Then you tell me,
[458.84] what is the problem?
[460.44] What is the truth? I want to know.
[466.84] You have never spoken to me 
so strictly before today.
[479.52] Before today, you too have lived up 
to my friendship, Wasai.
[492.64] You have always supported me.
[498.48] And today you are running away 
from my questions,
[501.68] why?
[504.12] Younger madam,
[507.56] I am afraid.
[509.48] What are you afraid of Wasai?
[512.00] I want to know.
[515.36] What is the matter?
[519.48] Younger madam,
[522.92] it is better that some things 
remain a secret.
[534.84] If they are revealed then 
everything is ruined.
[540.60] I don’t understand 
what have I asked you?
[544.60] I had asked you a simple question,
[548.68] and you didn’t answer it.
[551.72] You showed me a picture of a girl,
[554.76] and I asked you who she is.
[562.52] Because no one talked about 
her in this home,
[566.08] they didn’t mention her, 
they didn’t even take her name.
[574.52] Whether it is aunt Mehreen,
[576.16] uncle, aunt or Salman.
[580.28] Who is that girl?
[587.76] Is she even alive or not?
[590.48] I want to know who this Areej is.
[605.20] Won’t you tell me, Wasai?
[655.08] Come in.
[662.76] Sir, we had found some files in 
the accounts, see them, please.
[668.96] Fine, I will go through them.
[670.64] You can go. Thank you.
[672.48] Thank you.
[756.48] This is some Areej’s will.
[763.12] Who can she be?
[791.76] Hey. Hey. Hey.
[793.40] The owner of the company is 
in my room today.
[795.24] Come, son. Come. Come on.
[798.32] I am the owner of the company
[800.92] but today I have found out that there are 
a lot of things that I am not aware of.
[805.96] What don’t you know, son?
[808.36] I was going through some 
old company files,
[815.68] so some property files 
also came across.
[819.20] What does this have?
[820.52] This states that we have a 
10-acre land on the highway,
[831.72] and a long time back, we were 
going to setup a textile mill there.
[839.12] Why don’t I know about this?
[842.12] Err…
[843.40] yes, yes,
[845.04] this was last Waqar’s dream, that 
we should also have a textile mill.
[849.20] Was that so?
[852.52] Fine, if it was papa’s dream, then
we will surely setup a mill there.
[864.12] But it states that the mill that was being 
made was in Areej’s name. Areej Textile.
[877.12] Who is this Areej? 
Why don’t I know about this?
[883.04] That…
[885.28] actually, child, your mama sister in law
 Mehreen liked this name, that’s it.
[890.28] there is nothing special.
[894.08] Are you sure.
[895.84] Yes.
[897.16] But don’t mention this in front of her.
[903.12] Because she starts missing late Waqar
[906.68] and she starts getting unwell.
[912.68] You understand, son?
[917.68] Okay. Fine.
[933.04] The thing is that Waqar and Mehreen 
only love Salman in name.
[940.64] They only call Salman 
their son in words.
[944.20] Idrees, my son is not a toy,
[947.12] nor a decoration piece,
[949.92] whom Mehreen and Waqar use 
to console themselves.
[952.88] That’s not true, they love Salman 
with their heart.
[956.56] Leave it.
[959.00] They couldn’t put a 100-yard plot 
in Salman’s name
[964.36] and they are giving so much 
to their daughter.
[967.12] Don’t you see this?
[970.08] What is wrong, Shaista?
[971.76] All the properties are owned by Waqar,
[973.48] he will put them in his daughter’s name.
[975.72] You are having hopes for no reason.
[977.52] When does this happen.
[978.76] Right now, you won’t understand 
what I am saying.
[982.60] But if Salman has hopes 
because of this love,
[988.92] then you will get the answer 
to every question of mine.
[1012.96] I will tell you everything,
 younger madam
[1018.32] but you will have to make 
a promise to me.
[1023.56] What promise?
[1026.28] That you will not tell anyone 
what I will tell you.
[1041.28] Especially…
[1045.08] in fact, to no one.
[1048.08] Especially?
[1050.84] Meaning?
[1052.28] No one special.
[1055.28] Everyone is special.
[1067.36] Little sir knows nothing about this.
[1081.60] And madam,
[1090.76] and elder sir,
[1093.20] will curse me badly for 
revealing this secret.
[1107.00] Most importantly,
[1109.80] elder madam will not be able to 
tolerate this shock of her past.
[1121.28] Fine, Wasai.
[1123.64] You trust me, I will not tell 
anyone anything.
[1127.84] Tell me from the start, 
what is this story?
[1132.48] Elder madam
[1134.52] and elder sir didn’t have a child.
[1139.40] After a lot of prayers and charity 
a daughter was born at their home,
[1147.12] both of them named her Areej.
[1154.92] So,
[1157.60] when is that child now?
[1161.08] I don’t know where that child went.
[1174.68] God knows,
[1178.08] if she is alive or if she died.
[1186.56] What happened, then?
[1189.40] Elder sir was really happy.
[1193.20] He put all his property 
in Areej’s name.
[1205.76] He even got a gold jewellery 
made for her,
[1210.52] on which he got Areej’s name written.
[1219.36] Then where did that child go?
[1225.20] Elder sir,
[1227.00] wanted to start a factory 
in Areej’s name.
[1233.04] He left home to start the work 
of the factory,
[1241.00] and he had an accident.
[1248.20] Elder sir was no more.
[1251.36] Elder madam got hurt in the head,
[1255.48] and she lost her memory.
[1268.20] Nothing happened to madam,
[1272.64] she didn’t get hurt.
[1278.80] and that girl Areej?
[1282.00] What happened to her?
[1284.88] Then that girl was never found.
[1295.08] It was secluded place.
[1297.76] People say that maybe some wild
 animal ate that child.
[1320.96] Younger madam,
[1323.48] I have told you everything.
[1328.60] But you will have to remember 
your promise.
[1423.36] Mom was telling me 
you went to the doctor.
[1431.44] What did the doctor say?
[1437.28] Everything is fine.
[1439.20] Great.
[1441.08] Can I tell you something interesting?
[1446.16] Yes.
[1447.64] This is something even I didn’t know 
in all these years, but I found out today.
[1452.28] What is that?
[1453.64] Dad had started a project 
by the name of Areej textile.
[1469.20] I am surprised who was that Areej,
[1471.36] whose name dad and 
mom liked so much
[1473.68] that dad started a project
 in her name.
[1478.80] So, did you not try to find out
[1483.12] why he named it Areej.
[1486.12] I asked uncle, but he didn’t give me
a clear answer.
[1500.32] That had to happen.
[1510.00] Here everything is incomplete.
[1517.92] Everything is hidden from everyone.
[1528.72] No one knows anything.
[1537.68] What happened Arooj? 
What are you thinking?
[1542.76] Nothing.
[1544.08] Can I tell you another interesting thing?
[1551.56] The place where Master Shoaib 
and aunt Naseema found you
[1555.04] is really close to Areej textile.
[1568.64] Meaning, long time back 
we have stayed really close.
[1578.92] I will go get fresh.
[1642.60] It is completely your fault.
[1645.36] Who had told you to keep the land 
for the factory for so long.
[1650.76] You surprise me, Shaista.
[1652.52] It was late mama’s orders,
[1659.76] that it is Waqar and his daughter’s 
memento, and I shouldn’t sell the land.
[1663.16] So, I didn’t sell the land.
[1664.72] And till the time Salman grew up, 
I took care of the factory.
[1667.52] Waqar would have thought that 
putting everything in Areej’s name,
[1671.72] we will become dependent on her.
[1677.16] But still everything belongs to us.
[1680.72] What are you saying, Shaista?
[1683.40] Waqar was my younger brother 
and Areej my niece.
[1686.64] Really?
[1687.76] Your brother never treated you 
like a brother.
[1697.08] He always kept you as her employee.
[1700.32] I have no sorrow in that.
[1702.24] Because late Waqar was the one
[1704.16] who established that entire business, 
entire empire, not me.
[1708.84] Anyway, Mehreen did just 
one good thing in her life
[1713.96] that she considered our son 
Salman her own.
[1722.72] Because of which, all this property,
[1725.04] this business, became ours.
[1729.20] Shaista, today I am seeing that 
same old hatred in your tone.
[1770.08] This states that we have a 10-acre land
 on the highway,
[1774.92] and a long time back,
[1776.44] we were going to setup 
a textile mill there.
[1781.44] Why don’t I know about this?
[1784.56] Err…
[1785.72] yes, yes, this was last Waqar’s dream,
[1788.96] that we should also have a textile mill.
[1791.60] Was that so?
[1794.92] Fine, if it was papa’s dream,
[1798.36] then we will surely setup a mill there.
[1802.16] But it states that the mill that was 
being made was in Areej’s name.
[1806.56] Areej Textile.
[1811.88] Who is this Areej? 
Why don’t I know about this?
[1871.80] Waqar, what are these documents for?
[1876.16] I have put my property, 
this home,
[1879.32] the entire business in Areej’s name.
[1886.40] You have put everything 
in Areej’s name?
[1890.32] Yes, child, Mehreen,
[1892.76] even if you give your life 
for your daughter it is less.
[1896.48] Daughters are such creations.
[1902.88] Mehreen is considering 
Salman her son.
[1906.68] She always considers him her son.
[1908.64] Earlier she used to say 
Salman is her son,
[1912.12] but now we will say that 
Salman is Mehreen’s son.
[1917.84] Mama, what does this mean?
[1920.68] This means,
[1922.52] no one will make Mehreen realize 
that Salman is not her son.
[1932.76] And yes,
[1933.92] no one will mention Waqar and 
Areej in front of Mehreen.
[1937.88] This is my decision.
[1939.76] Yes, mama, as you say.
[1941.80] Did you hear me too, Wasai?
[1943.80] Yes, yes, mama, as you order.
[1950.12] This is a matter of my Mehreen’s life.
[1959.24] Shaista, I see the same old hatred 
in your tone today.
[1969.12] Hatred in my tone?
[1980.28] Because the sweetness of my tongue
has ended today.
[1992.68] So, what should I do?
[2000.48] I have sacrificed a lot.
[2008.72] I emptied my arms and 
fill Mehreen’s arms.
[2019.56] I handed over my Salman to her.
[2032.60] So, will that not have a price?
[2041.68] There surely will be.
[2046.56] And I will take that price as well.
[2056.52] I have shown patience 
on my motherhood.
[2068.12] You saw my patience,
[2075.84] now see my anger.
[2107.48] Elder madam
[2109.76] and elder sir didn’t have a child.
[2114.60] After a lot of prayers and charity 
a daughter was born at their home,
[2122.20] both of them named her Areej.
[2128.80] I don’t know
[2131.52] where that child went.
[2135.28] God knows,
[2138.52] if she is alive or if she died.
[2142.28] What happened, then?
[2145.16] Elder sir was really happy.
[2148.92] He put all his property 
in Areej’s name.
[2153.52] He even got a gold jewellery 
made for her,
[2158.40] on which he got Areej’s name written.
[2161.84] Then where did that child go?
[2164.12] Elder sir,
[2165.84] wanted to start a factory 
in Areej’s name.
[2171.84] He left home to start the work 
of the factory,
[2179.76] and he had an accident.
[2188.44] This picture is with Wasai?
[2203.24] And the bracelet this child is wearing
 in her hand,
[2213.52] even papa and mama have 
an identical bracelet.
[2230.16] The disappearance of this Areej
[2239.72] took place on the day of 
uncle Waqar’s accident
[2250.12] and the point of the accident 
is the same,
[2257.40] the day is also the same.
[2270.16] When mama and papa found me…
[2278.60] No, no, no,
[2283.56] so much coincidence?
[2291.32] This is life, not a film.
[2297.32] When does this happen?
[2304.84] This is not possible.
[2313.60] I have to bring this entire incident 
in order
[2328.24] and try to find out something.
