[20.72] You don’t want Salman to know
[24.44] that he is not aunt Mehreen’s son!
[38.36] Because if Salman’s real mother comes
 to know about the gunshot,
[42.96] then the poor woman will come crying
 and screaming to hug her son.
[57.96] And if that happens,
[61.48] then all your plan will be ruined.
[83.56] Anyways,
[86.96] you plan has already been ruined.
[122.24] My baby! My love! My dear, Areej!
[125.20] Come in…
[126.96] My dear! My Areej!
[133.12] Thank you.
[134.60] Here, I will put it down.
[138.28] Wasai,
[140.56] where is Arooj?
[142.56] She is in madam’s room…
[152.16] By the way,
[154.40] there is a good bonding between 
Arooj and Aunt
[165.52] yes…
[167.20] Not there is, there was!
[179.48] Now, there seems to be some 
strain between the two.
[187.52] Really?
[189.80] it’s that serious!
[191.76] Yes,
[197.36] otherwise sister Shaista never
 used to speak so harshly
[202.68] and cruelly for Arooj,
[212.00] right Wasai?
[213.92] Yes, elder Ma’am, 
you are right.
[239.04] My dear!
[240.48] Wasai!
[241.80] Give miss Areej back 
to her mother, here.
[246.52] My dear!
[376.08] It would be best
[378.44] if you left my room right now!
[382.08] Aunt,
[384.00] what is wrong with you?
[386.48] Oh! calm down aunt.
[397.16] Have a seat, 
why are you standing?
[401.12] I have come here 
to have a long chat.
[417.00] Won’t you agree to such a 
small request from your Arooj?
[427.76] Good girl!
[431.44] Okay,
[433.12] I will tell you a story today.
[436.52] I saw a woman,
[439.60] she only had one son
[442.76] and she even gave that son 
to someone else!
[453.40] What kind of rubbish story is this?
[459.20] Listen to what happened ahead,
[466.56] you will find this story really interesting.
[479.52] You know why that woman did all of this?
[484.20] Due to greed for wealth!
[497.44] I have never seen so much greed 
for wealth in someone’s eyes!
[510.48] That vicious woman,
[513.12] who was apparently a mother,
[516.16] but she used to tell everyone
[518.24] that she is doing all of this
for that woman!
[526.96] Otherwise, that woman will 
go crazy and die!
[539.40] And that vicious woman
[542.12] used to make everyone a fool
 by saying all of this.
[563.72] How did you find my story?
[566.00] Rubbish!
[568.20] Completely, rubbish!
[571.48] Oh!
[573.92] Wait, these were just the highlights.
[586.12] I will tell you the real story now.
[601.04] And what is this,
[602.88] you are standing again?
[610.72] Alright, I’ll stand then.
[616.92] I keep thinking, what kind of 
mother’s would they be,
[622.40] if a mother is greedy,
[625.92] then she can be evil as well
[639.68] who didn’t call her son, “Son”, 
for the past 25 years!
[648.88] In fear that she would lose 
the inheritance!
[653.92] No! Mothers are not like that!
[656.84] They are like that!
[662.00] And she is standing 
in front of me.
[674.16] My only point of telling you 
this story is,
[680.08] that I have all your secrets.
[691.92] So giving poison,
[693.92] pushing me down the stairs
[696.00] and firing bullets at me,
[700.60] leave all of this!
[702.92] Nothing will happen 
from all of this.
[714.32] Rest, you are smart,
[729.52] you must have understood.
[804.76] I have started
[809.28] the last round of the war aunt!
[817.52] Now let’s see,
[824.12] who will win…
[929.48] Mom,
[934.48] I have felt that
[937.60] you are much calmer since
 Areej has been born.
[942.12] Yes,
[944.32] it’s exactly that.
[947.00] You know Salman,
[950.40] I feel like
[953.80] I have a very deep and
old connection with Areej,
[970.48] but what is it?...
[1066.60] That vicious woman,
[1069.20] who was apparently a mother,
[1072.32] but she used to tell everyone
[1074.48] that she is doing all of this 
for that woman!
[1078.44] Otherwise, that woman will 
go crazy and die!
[1086.52] And that vicious woman
[1089.16] used to make everyone a fool
by saying all of this.
[1103.80] How did you find my story?
[1106.08] Rubbish!
[1108.28] Completely rubbish!
[1111.48] Oh!
[1114.00] Wait, these were just the highlights.
[1120.88] I will tell you the real story now.
[1140.20] I keep thinking, what kind of mother’s
would they be,
[1145.64] if a mother is greedy,
[1149.12] then she can be evil as well
[1157.48] who didn’t call her son, “Son”, 
for the past 25 years!
[1164.04] In fear that she would lose 
the inheritance!
[1169.32] No! Mothers are not like that!
[1172.28] They are like that!
[1174.80] And she is standing 
in front of me!
[1182.68] My only point of telling you 
this story is,
[1188.48] that I have all your secrets.
[1195.36] So giving poison,
[1197.24] pushing me down the stairs
[1199.40] and firing bullets at me,
[1203.84] leave all of this!
[1206.28] Nothing will happen from all of this.
[1220.68] What can Arooj do?
[1229.24] Afterall, she is my son, 
Salman’s wife.
[1240.12] Arooj will have to do
[1246.40] whatever Salman will ask her to do
[1255.08] and I am Salman’s mother, Mother!
[1272.48] Shaista, what is wrong? 
Why are you so angry?
[1274.48] Enough Idrees!
[1275.80] I cannot tolerate anymore,
[1277.32] I will not stop today!
[1278.80] Whoever will come in my way today,
I will crush them!
[1281.40] Hey! Listen…
[1286.96] Is this soothing?
[1292.16] Yes, a lot!
[1302.80] You know mom,
[1305.72] when I come to you,
[1309.16] I forget all my problems.
[1315.84] My son is, after all, my life.
[1330.52] My son is my life.
[1349.96] Leave my son,
[1351.48] leave, come Salman.
[1352.68] What? What are you saying 
sister-in-law?
[1355.72] I am telling the truth.
[1399.20] Salman is my son,
[1401.24] I gave birth to him.
[1409.28] I gave Salman to you,
just to save your life.
[1451.00] Now I want my Salman back, 
right here, right now!
[1484.80] How dare you utter such nonsense?
[1489.64] You did not do the right thing Mehreen!
[1492.84] I will do this again and again,
[1495.16] if you will do this then I will do 
this again and again.
[1498.60] How dare you call Salman 
your son?
[1501.64] Because Salman is my son!
[1503.80] Aunt, please!
[1521.24] Stop it,
[1523.00] what are you saying?
[1524.92] It is the truth, I am right!
[1527.04] You are really my son…
Salman!
[1528.72] Salman, tell her to get lost!
[1530.16] Brother Idrees take 
this woman away,
[1531.84] otherwise no one will be 
worse than me! Go away!
[1538.48] No one is worse than you.
[1541.00] It is such a weird thing,
[1542.84] no one wants to listen 
to the truth.
[1545.36] This is the truth! 
This is the truth!
[1547.68] Salman is my son,
 I want my son back
[1550.68] Please! Stop your rubbish and 
get lost from here! Go away!
[1552.72] Shaista come, come. Come Shaista.
Leave my hand! Idrees!
[1583.12] What happened to her! 
Had she gone mad?
[1586.32] What rubbish was she saying?
[1587.68] How was she calling you her son? 
How can she call you her son?
[1590.84] Doesn’t she know that 
you are only my son?
[1592.96] Tell me, had she gone mad?
 My Salman…
[1596.56] Mom, Please relax, 
nothing happened.
[1598.48] How everyone is trying to take 
away my Salman from me!
[1601.96] No one is taking me 
away from you.
[1603.88] I am here with you, 
nothing happened.
[1606.92] Nothing happened!
No, Salman is my son.
[1632.36] How come you remembered
my room today?
[1640.48] You are always found in 
your mother-in-law’s room.
[1645.80] She is not my mother-in-law,
[1647.84] she is my mother.
[1657.96] You know this very well,
[1660.12] and I have come to know 
about this as well.
[1663.00] So?
[1671.60] Quickly, now go
[1673.08] and tell this to Salman 
and Mehreen,
[1676.64] go!
[1694.24] Salman!
[1695.84] Nothing happened mom. 
I am here with you!
[1699.64] He is my son, no one else!
[1702.80] Everyone tries to claim their right.
[1747.48] Okay, I will tell you a story today.
[1752.60] I saw a woman,
[1755.80] she only had one son
[1758.76] and she had given that son 
to someone else!
[1766.44] What kind of rubbish story is this?
[1772.12] Listen to what happened ahead,
[1776.72] you will find this story 
really interesting.
[1784.92] You know why that 
woman did all of this?
[1789.52] Due to greed for wealth!
[1796.28] I have never seen so much greed 
for wealth in someone’s eyes!
[1809.64] Leave!
[1811.68] Leave my hand!
[1816.24] You have gone mad Shaista, 
you should accept it.
[1819.36] I have not gone mad,
[1821.48] Mehreen has gone mad!
[1823.56] And the time has come 
to treat her brain,
[1827.76] I will set her right!
[1829.80] By doing this, it will ruin 25 years plan.
Have you thought about that?
[1833.44] I don’t care. Now I don’t care 
even more!
[1837.96] Let me tell you one more thing,
[1840.36] whatever you are thinking, 
nothing will be destroyed!
[1844.24] What nonsense are you uttering?
[1845.80] How can there be an earthquake
 and no damage?
[1850.28] Whether the coin falls straight 
or opposite,
[1854.76] the win will be mine, only mine!
[1859.12] How will that happen?
[1862.72] Whose son is Salman?
[1866.08] He is our son.
[1867.76] And whom does all of 
this belong to?
[1869.88] It is all in Salman’s name.
[1871.08] Exactly,
[1873.08] Salman is our son, 
and he will remain our son.
[1876.12] Which means all of this 
is ours as well.
[1879.88] Do you understand 
what I’m saying?
[1881.80] How and in what way will Salman 
accept all of this?
[1889.36] Now, you need to wait,
[1894.88] wait for when my son Salman,
[1900.68] will call me ‘mother’.
[1952.16] What happened,
[1955.12] has a new life come 
into this house or
[1958.64] did someone die here?
[1966.44] I see sorrow on everyone’s face.
[1971.28] Mehreen, I am really happy.
[1974.24] In fact, we are all happy.
[1982.52] It is just Arooj who is staying 
away from everyone.
[1993.08] I will not ask Arooj anything,
[1996.24] because the pain 
she went through,
[1998.68] after that a person does suffer
from depression.
[2002.08] And Arooj has given 
my son a big gift.
[2006.60] My son is really happy.
