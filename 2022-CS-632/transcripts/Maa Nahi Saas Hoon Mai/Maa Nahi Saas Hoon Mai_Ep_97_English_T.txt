[32.68] That selfish Arooj and her mother 
shouldn’t get a penny.
[38.28] No one will be left with 
anything son.
[45.44] I mean, the two of them.
[47.80] I have spoken to the lawyer,
[49.16] I have given him the details 
of all the properties.
[51.20] We will snatch every single penny.
[64.68] And what did he say?
[66.68] Till when will he have 
the documents ready by?
[75.12] By today or tomorrow.
[76.88] I want them today.
[82.56] I cannot tolerate that Arooj 
in my home anymore.
[96.60] She tells me that all this is mine.
[106.04] I will show her who the owner is.
[110.64] Relax, son. 
Everything is under control.
[112.88] I will not relax, till all this gets fine.
[122.92] Till she doesn’t plead in front of me
 and apologize,
[125.84] I will not find peace.
[132.80] She is a weird cunning girl,
[135.20] at times she stands in front of me,
 at times in front of mom,
[137.88] at times she blames you 
for a second marriage,
[139.68] at times she blames you 
for corruption.
[145.96] Son,
[149.44] has someone ever been able 
to stop someone in the way?
[152.96] People like us change our path 
and move on, that’s it.
[156.40] We just let it go.
[179.84] I am your wife, 
this is my worth.
[182.20] Stop your nonsense.
[184.56] Your entire drama has flopped.
[189.36] Now come nicely and apologize 
to my parents
[192.04] I will not apologize to anyone,
[193.68] because I am right in my place.
[198.00] Arooj,
[201.92] don’t upset me further.
[204.28] Or else, what? Huh?
[206.56] What will you do?
[208.48] What will I do?
[210.36] I will do what you never even thought.
[214.60] One minute,
[217.36] today, I will show you.
[220.80] Look at this file.
[222.60] Read it. Read it.
[225.04] What is this?
[226.32] The home aunt Musarrat lives in, 
is my father’s property
[230.00] and the expense uncle is stealing 
from the office for his second wife.
[234.52] They are living off the earning 
of the office.
[236.84] Say all this is a lie.
[238.72] It is all wrong. 
Why don’t you speak up?
[240.60] Speak up!
[241.76] Arooj.
[366.32] Leave my son.
[367.80] Leave him. 
Come on, Salman.
[369.68] Hey, what are you saying 
sister-in-law?
[372.00] I am speaking the truth.
[374.16] Salman is my son.
[376.16] I gave birth to him.
[379.28] I gave Salman to you only 
to save your life.
[391.36] Now I want my Salman back,
[394.32] right this moment, right now!
[403.76] How did you dare to speak 
this nonsense?
[408.60] You didn’t do good, Mehreen.
[411.76] I will do this again and again.
[414.28] If you do this, then I will do it 
again and again.
[417.56] How dare you call my Salman 
your son?
[448.60] Salman is enough for Mehreen.
[456.44] To act like he is good.
[463.84] Now, how can I do all this?
[474.00] No. No.
[476.04] I am a really bad actor.
[478.56] I will not be able to do it.
[482.32] Mehreen will say one thing, 
I will say ten.
[487.96] Anyway,
[489.80] when was I a garland 
in Mehreen’s neck earlier?
[495.12] I will stay the way I was earlier.
[516.24] Wait, sister-in-law, Shaista.
[522.68] I had to inform you 
about something.
[526.28] Yes, go ahead.
[529.64] I have to tell you.
[532.24] My Salman
[537.84] came to me before going 
to the office today.
[543.08] So, what do I do?
[546.48] You did what you had to.
[554.28] The hatred you have filled in 
Salman’s mind against Arooj and I,
[560.04] it is all over now.
[568.28] He has found out
[570.48] who truly loves him.
[583.12] What is the matter, sister-in-law, 
Shaista?
[585.76] You are not answering me.
[590.48] Fine,
[592.48] I will also see Salman.
[594.80] You can see him.
[597.16] You can surely see him, 
when my Salman will be with me.
[605.24] Surely see him.
[635.72] Did you see, Mehreen,
[637.52] how I played the entire game
[640.52] and I won as well.
[650.24] What did you win?
[654.52] How I took back my son from 
that too will full profit.
[664.48] My son Salman
[668.72] is the only owner of this property 
and business.
[677.64] So you are admitting it yourself
[686.48] that you played this cheap trick.
[697.36] Earlier, you were only mad.
[703.64] Now you have also become stupid.
[710.48] And who is fooling you?
[715.28] Salman.
[717.88] She thinks that the hatred has ended.
[749.64] What do I tell you, mama?
[752.16] There are many issues in this home.
[754.68] You handled one problem, 
another starts.
[757.52] You solve the second, 
a new story starts.
[761.64] Leave everything else, child,
[764.12] tell me,
[766.24] is Salman good,
[768.04] I mean is Salman’s behaviour 
towards you good?
[774.16] Does he take care of you?
[777.76] Salman is fine, but he has 
a lot of mood swings,
[785.24] and then the next moment 
he realizes that yes,
[788.28] whatever I said was wrong,
 it was not right.
[791.48] Yes, child.
[795.04] Often men are like that.
[797.76] No, mama, don’t say that.
[803.52] I have never seen papa 
getting strict with you.
[810.08] It is a difference of the upbringing 
of the home,
[812.12] and the environment of the home.
[822.64] Master is anyway someone
who fears God.
[828.36] Then why don’t other people 
fear God?
[832.00] Arooj, child, is everything fine?
[838.40] Yes. Yes, everything is fine.
[840.84] I was just asking you.
[911.80] Hey Salman,
[913.80] when did you come from the office?
[915.84] Greetings.
[917.08] Greetings.
[919.64] I just came
[922.68] and like always I have come 
to your room to meet you.
[927.92] If you would meet Arooj first,
[931.28] I will not mind it.
[933.44] I have come for her.
[935.12] Really?
[936.52] Tell me, what is the matter?
[939.28] Mom, I want to take Arooj for dinner,
[943.44] if you allow.
[945.20] Yes, yes, do take her.
[948.00] Then you too come along.
[949.16] No, I am fine at home,
[951.96] you two spend time together.
[955.16] Thank you so much.
[958.24] By the way, Salman,
[959.92] Arooj has gotten very little 
comfort in this home.
[963.52] If you want, you can give her
happiness,
[971.12] so that she forgets 
all her sorrows.
[976.68] I am trying.
[984.32] I will ask her, then. 
Yes.
[986.88] I love you.
[990.28] She is sleeping.
[1089.80] Hello.
[1091.64] Yes, dad.
[1094.48] Yes, I am taking Arooj for shopping.
[1097.48] You keep the files ready.
[1099.60] We will get it signed from her 
when we come back.
[1101.72] Yes.
[1104.04] Salman, shall we go?
[1107.12] Yes, I was waiting for you
for so long.
[1109.28] Come on.
[1113.36] Arooj. 
Yes?
[1114.96] May I?
[1117.08] Thank you.
[1417.24] Salman,
[1420.36] I am really happy today.
[1423.20] What?
[1424.72] Really?
[1426.36] Yes.
[1429.76] Whenever you look at me with love,
[1432.92] I feel I found all the happiness 
in the world.
[1438.80] Then fine,
[1440.88] I will increase your happiness further.
[1445.48] The textile mill uncle Waqar thought 
of setting up in your name,
[1450.92] now, I will complete that project
[1454.44] and it will be in our daughter’s name.
[1458.00] Areej Textile.
[1460.32] Wow, this is a really good news.
[1465.40] Are you happy?
Really happy.
[1469.00] You are happy, 
so what else do I need?
[1472.32] Thank you.
[1573.04] Are you coming?
[1574.36] You go ahead. I am coming.
[1718.24] That selfish Arooj and her mother 
shouldn’t get a penny.
[1723.68] No one will be left with anything son.
[1726.20] I mean, the two of them.
[1728.52] I have spoken to the lawyer,
[1729.92] I have given him the details of 
all the properties.
[1731.80] We will snatch every single penny.
[1734.76] And what did he say?
[1736.72] Till when will he have the documents
ready by?
[1739.32] By today or tomorrow.
[1741.04] I want them today.
[1745.00] I cannot tolerate that Arooj 
in my home anymore.
[1753.24] She tells me that all this is mine.
[1759.00] I will show her who the owner is.
[1763.72] Relax, son. 
Everything is under control.
[1766.04] I will not relax, till all this gets fine.
[1771.88] Till she doesn’t plead in front of 
me and apologize,
[1774.92] I will not find peace.
[1825.92] They should believe that 
you have changed.
[1828.88] You cannot live without them.
[1831.12] You really love those two.
[1834.12] And as soon as you get the chance,
[1836.32] you get the signature on 
all the documents.
[1840.80] Trust me, son,
[1842.40] as soon as the documents 
are signed,
[1845.28] I will drag both these mother 
and daughter out of this home.
[1849.76] Hmmm.
[1852.32] Great idea.
[1855.52] But do you think I will be 
able to do this?
[1859.08] I don’t think so,
[1860.64] I have faith that you will do it.
[1864.56] Son, we just have worries 
for a few days,
[1868.68] then we will only have happiness.
[1870.52] All this will just be ours.
[1913.04] This is the file.
[1915.16] Our papers are after the first two.
[1922.12] Take Arooj’s signature and 
thumb print on it.
[1930.64] And Salman, please make sure,
[1934.12] Arooj is not able to 
read these papers.
[1948.84] Just take her signature on it,
[1952.04] after that all this is ours.
[2021.28] So, then tell me,
[2023.28] how did you like shopping?
[2027.20] You are really good.
[2030.48] You too are really good.
