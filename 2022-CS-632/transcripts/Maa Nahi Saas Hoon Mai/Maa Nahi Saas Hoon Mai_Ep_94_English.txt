I am telling you, don’t say a word against
my Mom and Dad now, Mom was absolutely right when
she said you are a liar. There were conflicts
created in this house and between the relationships
of this house because of you, all because of you. Look, there is still time, I am saying it very politely
to come and apologize. I told you I will not apologize
to anyone. You won’t? No. Arooj! Salman! Move back, don’t you dare touch
my daughter! You move aside. Move aside. I won’t. I am asking you to move! Mom, are you okay? Enough now, Salman! Come with me. Let’s go. Shaista, I am unable
to face you. What is this? Arooj hasn’t just let me
down in front of you but my own self too. I am being honest. Wasai? Wasai? Yes, I am coming, sir Jr. Yes? Go and call Arooj. Okay. Salman, my son, only you can retain your
father’s honor now. Nothing has happened
to your honor. You won’t get it, Shaista. At this point of my age, the only thing I am proud
of is my character, Arooj even took that away. Yeah. It looks like Arooj is quiet
after getting beaten, I can’t hear any voice
from Salman’s room. That’s what she deserves. We were living such a good life, I don’t know what was that cursed hour in which
Salman liked her. She ruined our lives. What is there to laugh about? I am thinking that Salman won’t like
Arooj at all now, yeah. So? The way he has gone
upstairs in anger and he is agreeing with us. How about we kick both mother
and daughter out of the house and we can rule here, yeah? What you say is so
strange sometimes, how will it benefit us if
both of them leave? We will just temporarily
get all this, don’t forget all of this is still in that
liar Arooj’s name. So then what should we do? Let us get everything in
our name first then both mother and daughter
can die if they want to, I don’t care. you mean the program to
get mother and daughter ... ...kicked out of this house
is cancelled. For now. I guess. Okay, come, let’s have tea. Wasai, bring tea. It’s good, it will be fun now. What are you doing? I even asked you not to but you still didn’t listen to me. Enough, we won’t live here now. You are thinking where will we go, we will go anywhere, Arooj, but we won’t live here. I have spent so many
years with honor here, now I cannot live by
getting humiliated. Okay relax! Relax. We won’t go away from here. And why should we go? So? what will we do? Don’t you remember what you said to me? This house, property, business, all this is mine, so when everything
belongs to us, why should we leave? These people won’t
let us live here. How wouldn’t they? Doing that is not in their control. Nothing like that will happen. Yes, you are right. But there is just one problem. Uncle, Aunt and Salman
have captured everything. No, not Salman. Not Salman. He, he just got manipulated
by all of them. Salman is not like that. He is not like that. What is your value in front
of my Mom and Dad. I am your wife,
that is my value. Shut up! All this drama that you played, everything got flopped. Now come nicely and go
apologize to my mom and Dad. I won’t apologize to anyone because I am right at my place. Arooj, don’t make me angrier. Else what will you do? What will you do? What will I do? I will do what you never thought. Wait a minute, let me show it to you today, look at this file, read it, read it. What is it? The house where Aunt
Musarrat lives, that is my Dad’s property and Uncle, the money that he is stealing
for his second marriage from the office, is living on the office expenses, tell me all this is a lie, all this is wrong, why don’t you say anything? Say it? Arooj. I am telling you, don’t say a word against
my Mom and Dad now, Mom was absolutely right
when she said you are a liar. There were conflicts
created in this house and between the relationships
of this house because of you, all because of you. Look, there is still time, I am saying it very politely
to come and apologize. I told you I will not
apologize to anyone. You won’t? No. Arooj! Salman! Move back, don’t you dare touch
my daughter! You move aside. Move aside. I won’t. I am asking you to move! Mom? Mom, are you okay? Enough now, Salman! Arooj has crossed her limits. I can never tolerate that Arooj
talks to me like this. I will not tolerate her
misbehavior anymore. Enough is enough. Sir Jr, Madam is calling you. Okay, I am coming and listen? Yes? There is no Madam Jr or Madam Sr
in this house from now onwards, there is only Begum Sahiba. Okay, whatever you say. Come on, go. All this is done by Arooj. I apologize to you on behalf of her. why are you apologizing
my child? The one who has done
all this, she should apologize. She will. She definitely will. That to by putting her
together in front of you. Today I have found out that a grown
son is a such a big support for a mother. Don’t hit me, don’t hit me, don’t hit me, Salman, don’t hit me. Salman, don’t hit me. I am your mother, your mother. Don’t hit me, don’t hit me, Salman. No, Salman, Salman don’t hit me. I am mother, your mother. Don’t hit me. Mom? Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me. Don’t ..
I am your mother. Mom, mom, no one  is hitting you. What happened to mom. Don’t hit me. Don’t hit me. He is hitting me. No one is hitting you. Salman, he is hitting me. He was hitting me. he was not hitting you. You had a nightmare. Yes, a very bad nightmare. He was hitting me. No one is hitting you. I am here, your daughter is with you. Yes, yes, you are my daughter. You are my daughter
but he, my son, My salman... he was hitting me. Mom, no one is hitting you. You just had a nightmare. He was hitting me. Okay, come, come lie down. How can he hit me? You try to sleep. He was hitting his mom. in fact, I will give you
a sleeping pill. You, take this. water. I will get water. He was hitting his mother. His mother. He was hitting his mother. I have decided, I will divorce Arooj. Your decision is absolutely right. This is what should
happen to Arooj, she deserves it. I agree with your decision, son. But you will not divorce
Arooj right now. Just wait for a while. Why? Why should I wait? I hate her. I know but do you know that Waqar had put
everything in Arooj’s name, Idrees didn’t get anything. Mom, I know all this. Talk about the future. If you know then also know that 4 factories, we have a farmhouse
in Hyderabad, we have 3 more houses
apart from this house and a lot of other things. If Arooj goes away, all this will go with her. Look, Salman, I have no interest in Arooj, and you don’t either, if not today but tomorrow you will have a second
marriage but son, what will happen to us
if we lose all this, just think that. So what do you think she will give all this to us easily? Not to us, to you. I have a plan. Come here, sit down. You went to reconcile
with Salman? That is what happens when someone loves anyone, they just try to make
it up to them, I am sure he must not
have listened to you, he is very stubborn when something gets
into his brain, it is impossible to
convince him. Are you comforting
yourself or me.... ... by telling me about
Salman’s nature? Both. Our pain is love. Salman will understand soon. You are here madam Jr? Mom’s condition is very bad,
Wasai. She is suffering from
intense mental stress. The one who has ruled
all her life and now all this, it is not tolerated. Did Salman misbehave
a lot with Mom? She has never been sad
about anyone except Sir Jr. It has been so many years, I have only seen this. How would thinking help,
Madam Jr? Yes, you are right, thinking won’t help
with anything. I am getting worried for
the people of this house. There are a lot of problems
in this house, there is no peace here. All this is done by
Begum Sahiba. Sir Rr is still sitting in her room, they are talking
about both of you, in fact, all 3 of you. You never know what
they must be thinking. How can a human being
be so greedy? I don’t know, money and wealth are such things. I was born in Adobe, all this doesn’t happen there. People care about each other. People who live in Adobe are true at heart, I guess that is why. Hmm, and here, houses made of stone and people made of stone. You are right. But don’t worry. Go and rest. Brother Idrees is
a very clever man, he must have done something because of which that woman
is running away from her rights. Yes, but, what should I do about Salman? What did Salman say? He wants me to apologize
to his parents that I won’t ever, because they don’t deserve it, it will be my insult if
I do this, Mom. So, no one can even force you,
Arooj, you are my daughter and I am still alive, I will break every hand that
comes on you. I am scared, Mom I don’t know what will happen. Arooj, don’t worry, my love. Whatever my God will want,
that will happen.
