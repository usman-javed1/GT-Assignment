[29.36] Areej. Factory.
[32.08] The accident on the highway.
[34.12] The bracelet in Areej’s name
[37.04] and a factory on the highway
[40.00] and that’s where my parents found me.
[42.96] Seriously?
[44.88] You are connecting all these dots?
[48.20] but one dot is left.
[50.64] Which one?
[53.72] You take me to mama’s home.
[58.08] Fine, take us to Arooj’s mama’s home.
[104.48] Elder sir was no more.
[107.60] Elder madam got hurt in the head,
[111.72] and she lost her memory.
[120.96] Nothing happened to madam,
[125.28] she didn’t get hurt.
[131.44] and that girl Areej?
[134.68] What happened to her?
[137.56] Then that girl was never found.
[143.16] It was secluded place.
[145.72] People say that maybe some 
wild animal ate that child.
[169.36] Child, Arooj,
[181.00] what will you do with all this?
[187.52] It is safe with me.
[193.32] Who do you want to show all this to?
[203.64] Have you found someone
[206.44] who is calling you their daughter?
[211.56] There is no one else in this world
other than you
[215.04] who would call me their daughter.
[217.60] Then?
[219.32] What will you do with all this?
[240.28] I will do something with it.
[250.48] And if nothing happens,
[256.68] then I will return it back to you.
[262.24] Child, take care of yourself.
[270.64] I don’t want to break your courage,
[273.48] but you need to rest in such a situation
[277.56] and you are running around like this.
[283.52] The situation and incidents 
have forced me, mama
[287.72] or else I never wanted to 
put myself in this effort.
[295.64] Can I give you an advice?
[299.84] Yes.
[302.52] Keep Salman informed about 
your matters.
[307.20] He is your well-wisher.
[315.00] You are right.
[319.28] When the time comes,
[322.28] I will tell him everything.
[325.20] Well done. Live long.
[456.24] Great.
[458.12] Can I tell you something 
interesting?
[460.60] Yes.
[462.04] This is something even I didn’t know 
in all these years, but I found out today.
[466.64] What is that?
[468.16] Dad had started a project 
by the name of Areej textile.
[475.84] I am surprised who was that Areej,
[478.04] whose name dad and 
mom liked so much
[480.28] that dad started a project 
in her name.
[485.32] So, did you not try to find out
[489.60] why he named it Areej.
[492.72] I asked uncle, but he didn’t 
give me a clear answer.
[523.64] Younger madam,
[526.72] what happened to you?
[528.44] Why are you so serious?
[536.88] Did someone say something to you?
[549.08] No one will say anything.
[555.44] Whatever will be said,
[561.28] will be said after you speak.
[568.36] What do you mean?
[571.00] I didn’t understand.
[575.72] I didn’t understand anything either.
[587.00] Will you make me understand?
[590.60] Me?
[592.56] What do I make you understand?
[688.28] Who does this belong to?
[700.24] Areej.
[814.52] How do you have this?
[820.88] All this...
[825.48] All this is mine, Wasai.
[878.04] You are elder madam’s Areej?
[906.84] Younger madam.
[940.88] I have been searching for my mother
for so many years.
[944.76] I kept on looking,
[949.76] for so long.
[955.60] And see,
[959.68] me and her are living under 
the same roof together.
[975.64] Nature operates in mysterious ways.
[984.68] Wasai.
[987.24] Wasai.
[1020.84] I thought I would come 
and see myself,
[1024.20] what secrets you two are sharing.
[1041.28] What happened, to Wasai?
[1044.64] Has she gone mad?
[1071.48] Yes, madam Arooj.
[1074.68] Salman is your present,
[1078.60] who you have under your control,
[1081.92] but I have come here to find out,
[1085.40] what family’s child are you?
[1097.12] Do you even have a family or not?
[1109.84] Whose daughter, are you?
[1127.04] Mama.
[1138.64] Hey,
[1140.28] move back.
[1141.84] Why are you stuck to me? 
Move back.
[1144.16] Mama.
[1145.28] What mama?
Hey move back.
[1148.96] Why are you stuck to me?
Move back. Move.
[1154.68] Have you gone mad?
[1156.72] Why are you calling me, mama?
[1158.56] I am not your mother.
[1161.72] Are you mad?
[1165.00] She is calling me mama. 
I am not her mother.
[1169.36] Mama.
[1179.48] Mama.
[1226.52] I have been searching for my mother
for so many years.
[1230.32] I kept on looking,
[1235.36] for so long.
[1241.28] And see,
[1245.24] me and her are living under
 the same roof together.
[1261.20] Nature operates in mysterious ways.
[1269.16] Little madam,
[1275.92] she is our madam Areej.
[1283.52] Wow, God. Wow.
[1288.96] Without a doubt,
[1294.00] the one who saves is bigger than 
the one who kills.
[1366.96] Hello. Yes, mom?
[1369.88] Hello Salman, where are you?
[1373.12] Mom, I came to meet a friend of mine.
[1375.44] Why? All okay?
[1377.56] Nothing is fine.
[1379.36] I have told you so many times 
not to leave home at any time.
[1383.96] But who listens to me?
[1385.72] What happened mom? 
Why are you worried?
[1387.64] Is everything okay?
That Arooj,
[1390.40] I feel she has been possessed.
[1395.32] She is saying weird things,
[1397.72] and her eyes have become weird too.
[1400.16] And she is hugging me 
calling me, mama.
[1404.96] What is wrong, mom?
[1407.00] When she doesn’t love you, 
you don’t like it.
[1410.16] Now she is hugging you with
 love calling you mama,
[1412.52] you still don’t like it.
[1421.48] Mom...
[1428.48] I don’t know what happens to mama.
[1434.48] This boy will never understand me.
[1440.84] Something is surely wrong,
[1444.04] I will have to find out myself.
[1454.20] Wasai. Wasai.
[1457.36] Yes, elder madam.
[1458.92] I will raise my hand on 
this girl someday,
[1461.32] she is getting out of hands day by day.
[1464.00] She has irritated me. 
She will make me mad.
[1467.20] This girl has started something new,
[1469.12] she is calling me, mama.
[1472.64] Now you tell me,
[1473.64] can I be someone else’s mother 
other than Salman?
[1476.48] No. Not at all.
[1477.80] You can be no one else’s mother 
other than little master.
[1483.92] You go and explain this 
to this Arooj as well
[1487.08] that if she calls me mother 
after today,
[1489.24] then I will break her face.
[1490.84] Elder madam, you don’t worry.
[1494.40] I will just go and make 
younger madam understand.
[1497.76] She will not call you mama 
after today.
[1503.04] First she took my son becoming 
his wife,
[1505.72] and now she is trying to make me 
emotional calling me her mother.
[1557.80] Younger madam, 
what did you do?
[1563.44] What did I do?
[1566.08] You called elder madam, mama.
[1574.08] She left so angry from here.
[1579.72] If I don’t call my mother mama, 
then what will I call her.
[1585.56] Okay,
[1586.92] so you want to announce it.
[1594.28] I had become emotional.
[1604.00] After so long a daughter 
saw her mother,
[1607.72] will she not even hug her?
[1611.32] Younger madam,
[1613.60] I understand your emotions.
[1619.72] But you becoming emotional like this,
[1623.32] is not the solution to this problem.
[1629.72] What problem?
[1633.72] If the daughter is calling her mother,
 mama,
[1636.52] then what is the issue in this?
[1638.48] Younger madam,
[1641.16] you don’t understand.
[1647.04] Elder madam’s health is 
also a big issue.
[1659.32] The doctors have always told us
[1662.36] that any big incident or shock can 
make her completely mad.
[1679.60] Or she can even lose her life.
[1683.12] God forbid.
[1685.16] I don’t want to lose my mother 
once again.
[1691.36] Then have some patience, 
younger madam.
[1700.16] When the right time comes, 
tell everyone the truth.
[1756.16] Now you tell me yourself, Salman,
[1758.64] did Arooj do the right thing?
[1762.00] Mom, you should actually be happy
that she considers you like her mother.
[1766.72] Every mother in law, dreams of 
such a daughter in law.
[1770.28] I don’t see such scary dreams
[1772.24] that whoever wants gets up and 
calls me their mother.
[1777.68] I am only your mother
[1780.20] and I have no relation with 
anyone else other than you.
[1782.92] Just Salman and his mother.
[1785.76] Okay fine, 
don’t give yourself tension.
[1788.52] There is nothing like that.
[1790.24] There is something like that, Salman.
[1793.72] Fine, I will talk to her. 
You relax.
[1797.36] Yes, please, 
go and make her understand.
[1800.72] Fine, I will make her understand.
[1808.76] Did you take your medicine?
[1810.96] No, I haven’t, I will have it.
[1812.32] I knew that you wont take it, 
I will have to give it.
[1815.52] If I get a new shock daily,
[1817.48] then how will I get time 
to have my medication.
[1819.44] Okay fine, you relax, 
have your medication.
[1824.92] Here.
[1836.44] Now you relax,
[1838.36] I will go talk to her.
[1840.20] Yes, please.
[1845.32] Goodnight. 
Goodnight.
[1852.76] Mama.
[1855.12] Whoever wants will consider me 
their mother.
[1895.24] Idrees. 
Yes?
[1897.88] What is the matter? Since you have 
come you are constantly smiling.
[1904.88] Nothing, I am seeing the circus
of the world
[1907.16] that what cunningness people 
will innocent faces do.
[1911.28] Who are you talking about?
[1912.96] The same. Arooj.
[1915.44] Oh my God.
[1918.60] Idrees, I don’t understand, why do you
have an enmity with Arooj.
[1924.04] What enmity do you have with her?
[1927.32] I have no enmity.
[1928.88] Then why do you talk to her in such
 a degrading tone about her?
[1936.08] You know how much I like her.
[1939.84] Yes. Yes. I know.
[1941.92] She is your Salman’s wife, 
your daughter in law.
[1945.48] But you could never tell her.
[1951.04] When you know everything,
[1953.92] then why do you oppose Arooj?
[1958.40] Listen to what Mehreen told me.
[1960.96] What? What?
[1963.16] Now even Mehreen thinks like you 
in Arooj’s matter.
[1970.24] Anyway,
[1971.96] what did she tell you? 
Tell me.
[1975.40] Look at Arooj’s cunningness, 
she hugged Mehreen.
[1981.08] What?
[1985.20] No, no, Idrees, you must have 
some misunderstanding.
[1988.24] Arooj cannot do this.
[1998.20] Arooj can never have love in her heart 
for an ill-mannered woman like Mehreen.
[2005.12] What’s more is that 
she called her mother.
[2014.40] Now you understand, Arooj?
[2016.24] Her biggest enemy at home 
wants to hug her
[2018.88] and take over everything at home.
[2021.32] There is nothing like that.
[2024.56] Arooj has this habit, 
she loves everyone.
[2029.72] Really?
[2031.28] Then why did she never call you,
mama?
[2068.00] Who told you?
Mehreen.
[2070.28] And you believed her?
[2072.16] Why should I not believe her?
[2077.28] I asked Arooj, 
she had no answer.
[2082.68] This means that Arooj is not 
master Shoaib and Naseema’s daughter?
[2090.24] And you see
[2092.60] that those two fulfilled the 
responsibilities of parents well.
[2099.04] They didn’t let us have a doubt.
[2101.88] Shaista, doubt? 
Now I am sure.
[2105.48] About what?
[2106.72] That an abandoned girl can do 
such a thing
[2109.24] that Arooj did in the business 
and home.
[2129.40] I don’t understand these relations.
[2142.84] If you called mom, mama, then 
what is there to mind in this?
[2147.44] Mom at times behaves like a child.
[2154.52] in future, I will not call her mama.
[2159.72] How did you find out that 
she didn’t like it?
[2163.76] I can see that from her behavior.
[2174.24] But I don’t want that she has 
any worry because of me.
[2179.68] Arooj, are you feeling okay?
[2188.12] If you want, then 
we will go to the doctor.
[2192.16] No,
[2194.24] I am fine.
[2198.44] You took a step towards mom with love
[2208.12] and she insulted you.
[2211.52] Did you not dislike it?
[2220.00] Now I don’t dislike anything she says.
[2234.92] She is really good.
[2254.32] Turn off the light,
[2256.28] I am sleepy.
