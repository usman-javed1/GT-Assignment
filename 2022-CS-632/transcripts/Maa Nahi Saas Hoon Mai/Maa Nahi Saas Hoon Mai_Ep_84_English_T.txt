[21.92] Wasai,
[24.68] you are getting worried 
for no reason.
[27.60] Everything is going in 
the right direction.
[30.04] How is it going right?
[34.12] Everyone in the house has become 
distant from one another.
[37.92] They have not become distant,
[39.84] they have just been exposed 
to one another
[46.08] and it's a good thing,
[48.04] I got my mother and
Salman got his mother.
[51.32] No, no young Madam,
[53.96] you don't understand!
[61.24] What young master got,
[63.60] he is not accepting her 
as his mother,
[71.52] and when you will tell elder Madam,
[78.72] then she will not accept you 
as her daughter.
[91.48] This way, everything has 
gotten more tangled.
[94.64] Wasai, nothing like this will happen.
[97.96] When I tell Mom I am her daughter,
[101.28] she will accept this fact.
[107.60] I just know
[109.64] I have to talk about this 
at the right time.
[116.12] Have faith in me.
[119.52] Okay,
[120.92] I will accept it if you are saying it.
[131.88] May God keep everything alright.
[214.12] Did you see?
[220.28] What happened?
[224.20] You think that you did a good job 
by telling Salman everything?
[231.16] He had to know.
[237.32] If your conspiracy had not 
been revealed
[240.76] then you would have never 
thought about telling him.
[244.36] I did what I thought was right.
[251.96] He is my son,
[254.12] Salman is my son!
[265.80] What young master got,
[271.56] he is not accepting her 
as his mother,
[281.16] and when you will tell 
elder Madam,
[289.00] then she will not accept you 
as her daughter.
[309.08] Salman,
[310.92] child, what happened? 
How did this happen?
[313.68] Salman, son, is everything alright? 
Are you okay?
[315.96] Yes, Uncle, I am fine.
[317.96] Actually, two people came 
on a bike and they fired.
[326.76] Thank God, I am fine now.
[328.64] Did you report it to the police?
[330.84] Yes, Mom.
[336.12] You did right.
[337.52] You did absolutely right.
[338.92] Okay, don’t worry, I am fine. 
Nothing happened.
[343.68] Ideees! Get a black goat quickly
[346.60] and do charity for my Salman.
[348.32] Yes, yes
[349.48] Wasai, go and make 
some turmeric milk.
[351.56] Go quickly.
Yes!
[354.56] Come on, come inside. Come.
[356.32] Come on, son. Carefully.
[358.96] Is it hurting a lot?
[360.48] Are you in pain?
[361.52] Don’t worry, I am fine.
[414.40] This means the bullet was 
fired at Arooj.
[427.20] Maybe this is just my thinking,
[430.48] or maybe
[433.00] I was their target.
[442.12] I don’t understand anything.
[451.80] Oh,
[455.04] Idrees,
[456.48] order a black goat and do charity
for my Salman.
[493.84] This is not a lie, Son.
[496.40] This is the truth.
[498.20] You are not Mehreen’s but my son!
[502.44] Mehreen is not your mother, 
I am your mother.
[527.64] I am not your uncle,
[529.68] I am your father,
[531.28] and Shaista is your mother.
[552.24] Dear, God! Help me.
[556.88] Help me!
[756.60] I never felt that you were hopeless.
[763.00] In six years of marriage,
[766.16] there was no child nor any hope.
[773.52] A woman wishing to be a mother, 
is disappointed.
[777.92] Well,
[781.36] thank God now,
[783.80] that He didn’t let your hope die.
[788.56] He listened to our prayers.
[804.68] Areej!
[806.20] It is so pretty, Mehreen, look.
[811.64] It is a very pretty name.
[814.64] So, you gave her a name of 
your liking, right?
[817.56] Yes,
[819.16] because Areej is a very pretty name.
[821.56] Right, Mom?
[822.88] Yes, it is a very pretty name.
[826.40] Now our entire home will smell
 of her scent.
[872.24] Areej!
[894.24] Why did I have such a weird dream?
[899.20] Waqar,
[902.04] oh,
[903.16] it is time for Waqar to come home, 
in fact, Waqar must be home now.
[905.76] Let me check,
[907.40] how did I sleep for this long today?
[910.32] How did this happen?
[916.52] Wasai!
[917.60] Wasai!
[919.20] Yes, yes elder Madam.
[921.56] Wasai, did Waqar come back 
from office?
[929.84] Why are you staring like that?
[937.84] Waqar,
[939.64] how would you know 
if he came or not?
[943.52] Because he calls me before 
leaving the office,
[947.44] okay I will wait for Waqar.
[956.28] Go to Wasai Bi.
[961.12] Young Madam is really pretty.
[966.96] May God protect her from evil eyes.
[969.76] Amen. Amen.
[971.64] Here you go Madam.
[973.44] That’s it, Wasai?
[975.00] Yes.
[975.72] Come. Come. Mama’s love.
[979.12] That’s it, Wasai is tired.
[983.76] Are you happy now, Wasai?
[985.52] Yes, yes. Thank you very much.
[988.36] Actually, I don’t have a child,
[992.00] so I just couldn’t resist 
after seeing the child.
[996.08] No problem, Wasai. 
You will take care of her.
[998.92] Yes, sure.
[1001.92] Do you want it? 
Do you want it?
[1017.84] What is all of this happening?
[1025.88] It feels like
[1033.32] we have gone 25 years back.
[1041.12] The same tone,
[1047.52] the same attitude.
[1114.40] Young Madam!
[1116.20] Young Madam!
[1117.88] What happened? 
Is everything alright?
[1120.00] Everything is fine but 
I am shocked as well.
[1123.64] Shocked, about what?
[1125.92] Elder Madam came to me 
in the kitchen,
[1133.56] she has changed.
[1137.24] She has changed?
[1139.00] What are you saying, Wasai?
[1141.36] She came to me in the kitchen 
and asked me about your father,
[1145.20] Elder Master.
[1155.24] She asked if Waqar had come back
from the office,
[1165.44] however, she used to ask me this
[1170.12] when Elder Master was alive
[1178.36] and she lost her memory 
after that accident
[1191.08] and it has been a while since 
she asked me about Elder Master.
[1197.60] Are you telling the truth?
[1202.64] What else did Mom say?
[1204.24] The same thing,
[1206.28] that Waqar didn’t come back,
[1209.56] and then she said 
how stupid is she,
[1212.80] Waqar calls her before 
leaving the office.
[1221.56] It means,
[1224.36] it means Mom is remembering 
everything,
[1233.04] and all of this
[1238.40] happened because of 
my daughter, Areej.
[1298.12] What happened, Aunt?
[1300.52] I asked Wasai to make
a cup of tea for me.
[1308.08] She said no in my face,
[1309.72] she said I am taking care 
of Areej.
[1315.44] I asked her to stay with Areej.
[1318.36] Why do you have surveillance 
at home?
[1320.92] Couldn’t she leave her 
for two minutes?
[1322.60] She couldn’t leave her at all.
[1325.20] Why?
[1330.44] At times, we are more unsafe 
inside the home, than outside.
[1343.16] So, you have to keep a watch.
[1359.84] What happened, 
Sister-in-law Shaista?
[1362.68] Are you mad at me?
[1379.76] Anyway, leave all of this, tell me,
[1382.24] have you seen Salman?
[1384.84] He was just playing with me
 in the room,
[1386.64] don’t know where he went playing!
[1402.88] What’s wrong Mehreen?
[1405.16] What are you rambling about?
[1408.00] Have you gone mad?
[1410.36] Salman has made me mad,
[1412.64] he has tired me by playing!
[1414.52] I don’t know where he has gone.
[1419.00] Maybe he went to the roof,
[1441.16] nowadays, he likes flying kites,
[1443.96] I’ll go and see.
[1451.80] Salman!
[1453.92] Salman!
[1471.96] Did you think,
[1473.76] if Mehreen comes to know that 
Arooj is her daughter, Areej,
[1477.64] then what will happen to us?
[1480.24] There are so many lies tied 
to this one truth,
[1483.48] that will be uncovered.
[1486.32] Nothing will happen,
[1487.52] you just need to think from your mind
instead of your emotions.
[1489.36] Think from your brain.
[1491.68] I don’t have enough time to think 
and use my brain.
[1500.12] It won’t even take a minute 
for this game to be ruined!
[1503.12] And that one minute could be 
the next one.
[1509.00] It is not easy to tell the truth,
[1511.56] I am waiting for the right time.
[1515.20] Removing Arooj out of our way 
is our compulsion,
[1517.92] not our wonder.
[1519.52] Our wonder would be,
[1521.60] having no evidence left.
[1606.76] There are two enemies of us, 
in our home.
[1613.80] One is Arooj and 
the other is Mehreen.
[1623.96] Now, we should do this, 
we should tell Mehreen
[1627.64] that Salman is not hers 
but our son.
[1632.80] What will happen from all of this?
[1634.24] She will go mad from the shock.
[1639.64] But our target is Arooj,
[1641.60] who has the entire business 
in her name.
[1643.64] It is necessary to defeat Arooj’s luck.
[1647.56] We don’t have time.
[1651.08] That’s why we will have 
to change the plan.
[1653.84] No, no, think of something else.
[1656.84] And keep in mind that 
the wind is against us,
[1660.00] any carelessness will throw us 
to a new place.
[1666.92] Remember this.
[1671.40] What I thought is exactly 
what is happening.
[1680.00] The first round of Mehreen’s complete
 madness has started.
[1692.20] Arooj gained her mother 
with a lot of cleverness,
[1699.76] but such an incomplete Mother!
[1710.92] Now slowly, slowly, Mehreen
[1720.20] will go completely mad.
[1727.96] Now, Mehreen will not get better.
[1735.24] Salman is my son,
[1742.52] now only Arooj is left.
[1749.16] She is alone now,
[1758.16] I will see her myself!
[1769.68] What happened? 
What are you thinking?
[1774.60] Mehreen.
[1776.80] What did she say?
[1779.28] She was rambling about things.
[1781.84] What things?
[1785.80] She was talking about 
Salman as if
[1788.88] Salman is a five to six-year-old kid.
[1797.96] She was saying that 
he is flying a kite
[1801.64] and he is playing around, 
something like that.
[1805.12] What kind of rubbish conversation 
is this?
[1807.12] Mehreen was half mad already,
[1808.80] and your truth has made her 
go completely mad!
[1812.36] Yes,
[1815.40] but I fear,
[1816.80] what if she hurts someone? 
Especially Salman?
[1820.12] She cannot harm anyone,
[1822.04] especially not Salman.
[1827.24] You are agreeing to her love 
for Salman?
[1831.44] This is the reality, whether 
we accept it or not.
[1842.76] By the way, if Mehreen goes 
completely mad
[1845.76] then it is beneficial for us.
[1856.32] This way Salman will be ours easily,
[1865.96] and all the properties as well.
[1886.52] Think.
[1891.76] Waqar worked with his own intuition
[1894.36] but you work with experience.
[1898.84] But to work independently, 
I need authority just like Waqar’s.
[1902.52] Yes, so they are yours after 
Waqar’s death, right?
[1907.12] No, it is not like that, Shaista.
[1909.24] The decision is taken 
by the board of directors
[1911.84] or the head of the board.
[1913.52] And who is the head of the board?
[1916.64] After Waqar, the head of the board 
is Mehreen.
[1920.96] If she signs, then all the authority
will be mine on its own.
[1926.44] Okay, don’t worry.
[1929.44] Mehreen is mentally unstable,
[1933.12] how hard is it to get her signs?
[1935.24] I will get her signatures.
[1938.00] Okay, if you say so,
[1941.84] wait.
[1948.00] Here, have this.
[2006.88] Hello
[2008.12] How are you, Salman?
[2011.16] I am fine, how are you, Basit?
[2014.76] The thing to tell is,
[2017.08] the shooter who attacked you,
[2020.40] we have traced him.
[2028.48] We raided him but he escaped.
[2033.64] So what is the point of 
telling all of this?
[2036.04] This is not as simple as you are 
thinking it to be, Salman.
[2043.84] Those boys are hired assassins
[2047.00] and they have a criminal record.
[2050.92] What do you mean?
[2052.16] It means someone else 
is your enemy.
