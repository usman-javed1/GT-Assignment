I understand the meaning of your 
phone call. Meaning, the comfort with which you have
 explained the entire scenario to me, that Arooj can get the test done again, then what can happen, 
what cannot happen, I understood it all. Right now, you send Arooj from there, I will take care of the rest. Alright. This doctor is really clever, but this Arooj isn’t any less clever. She reached there secretly. Sorry, I got a little busy and you people also came without
an appointment. Yes, doctor. So, I was saying that you people 
don’t believe our reports. You don’t understand, look, it is also necessary for us
to be satisfied. You know the credibility of our hospital. No one in the entire country has 
such advance machinery, and these reports have been given 
to you after testing. Okay fine, I agree that 
these reports are fine, and I am also really satisfied hearing 
what you said, but, there must be a treatment for all this. Look, you get satisfied first. Get the test done from wherever you want, and as far as the treatment is concerned,
 we will take care of it later. And leave this report with me, my assistant will call you. But, we are professionals. Thank you. Let’s go, mama. Aunty Mehreen. You are here? All okay? I am so sorry, I didn’t take your permission and 
I came to your room. It’s okay. Have a seat. You know, you don’t need permission. Actually, I wanted to talk about Salman. I couldn’t resist, so I came 
to your room to talk. Yes, tell me. What do you want to talk about Salman? Aunty Mehreen, since Arooj’s medical reports came, I see you more worried than her. I mean, these are her reports, 
it is her issue, she should be worried, right? I am worried for my Salman. My Salman’s wife is not capable 
of becoming a mother. This way, my Salman’s life will be ruined. Exactly, and there will be thousands of girls like 
Arooj in the world who cannot be a mother. There must be, but Salman is my only son. I want to fill my son’s life
with all the happiness. Obviously, aunty. I know this. I know you are his well-wisher
and he is yours. But if Arooj cannot become a mother, 
so what? I mean, you can become a grandmother, Salman can be a father. Look, Salman is still young, he earns well, he is educated. What does he lack? After all… after all, Arooj is not the last woman
in this world. It is good that you got your checkup done
 by that doctor yourself or what is the issue that 
cannot be resolved. Yes, I did visit the doctor. But everything is the same, as I have told you. Look Arooj, that was the expertise 
of that doctor, and I would say that a person should 
satisfy their heart. Because this is an issue for life. Yes, we have an issue now. Okay, you don’t worry. My mama’s friend is a gynaecologist. I will talk to her to take time for you. We should also take a second opinion. Thank you. No need to thank me. You just don’t worry now. 
I am going now. I will call you and tell you as soon as 
I get an appointment, okay? You won’t get worried, right? Okay. Bye. 
Bye. Wasai. Hey, little madam, you. Do you want something? I want to have coffee. Yes, yes, why not? You go to your room. 
I will bring it for you. By the way, this friend of yours…
what is her name? Shanzay. Does she come here often? I am she seemed like 
your well-wisher. Friends are always well-wishers. Yes, you are right about that. I have heard everything 
you two talked about. It is called bad manners listening 
to someone talk secretly. It must be. You know, you are really weird people. Where you should show manners, 
you don’t show it and where you don’t need to 
show manners, there… In fact, one minute, it is also part of your manners 
and traditions that the woman who doesn’t 
have a child, you divorce her and send her away 
from the home, right? For your kind information, you don’t divorce the one 
who doesn’t have a child. Is your madam Arooj, right? Here, I see everyone crazy 
for madam Arooj. Mom, I don’t understand 
what you are saying. Salman, you know well 
what I am talking about. Why do you always act unaware 
on this topic? Mama, will you clarify and tell me,
what topic are you talking about? I am talking about Arooj not being 
able to be a mother. I want your child at all cost. Mom, why do you worry? Very soon, I will give you a good news. Really? How is that? The opinion of the doctors is not 
hidden from anyone. Mom, I have made a decision. I will adopt a child. What? We will bring up someone else’s child? Salman, that is really weird. I am literally surprised aunty. 
I am surprised right now. I am surprised at Salman’s thinking. Why would you bring up 
someone else’s child? Mom, what are you saying? When we will bring up that child, 
they will be our child. After all, there is a small legal process, after that me and Arooj will be 
their legal parents. Hear me out clearly Salman, this will not happen while I am alive. We will not bring up an adopted child. I just want my Salman’s child. Impossible. This boy has gone mad. We will bring up someone else’s child. My only son is saying that we will 
bring up someone else’s child. Aunty, you please relax, 
we will talk to him. He only follows Arooj’s advice. You know, you are really weird people. Where you should show manners,
 you don’t show it and where you don’t need 
to show manners, there… In fact, one minute, it is also part of your manners 
and traditions that the woman 
who doesn’t have a child, you divorce her and send her away
 from the home, right? Arooj. What are you thinking? I am thinking that I am so unlucky. You are not unlucky. I cannot be a mother. And you are saying I am not unlucky? Arooj, I don’t consider this as bad luck. And please, you don’t think about this. You don’t think anything, Salman, but people think. Or maybe, they will also make a decision. Who are those people? 
What are they thinking? I don’t know. Arooj, trust me. No one can make any decision 
against my will, with me here. And it doesn’t matter to me 
what anyone is thinking and what they are not thinking. Did you call me? Yes, have a seat. I want to talk to you about 
something important. I am sure it is about Salman. How did you get an idea for this? Because I know, no one else in your life more 
important than Salman. But maybe Salman is forgetting this. Hmmm. It is possible. Why? You don’t believe it? I believe it. I know you cannot be wrong. But aunty, I don’t like interfering in Salman and 
Arooj’s personal matter like this. But now that you have called me, so whatever you say. Alizay, you are a good girl. You too are really good. In fact, you are just like 
Salman told me about you. Okay, what did you want? 
You had called me. Actually, Alizay, I cannot tolerate it at all that Salman brings up someone else’s child. Yes, you should strictly say no to him, then. So that he cannot ignore what you say. After all, someone else’s child is a stranger. I don’t know what is wrong with him? Why is he making such weird 
experiences with his life? What has happened? You talk to him. Why are you worried? I am seeing that you are worried 
since Arooj came and went. Master, the sorrow of not bearing a child 
is life taking. It eats up a person on the inside. Do you remember the difficult days we have been through? Homes get ruined. But this didn’t happen between us. Why did you think of this? I too have gone through the sorrow
of not having a child, and now it has come in my daughter’s share. Oh my God. Arooj came to tell you this. Yes. I took her to the hospital. The doctor says the report that we have received
is the truth. Okay, you don’t cry. God will make it better. I am crying because we had Arooj later. You have always supported me. I had no mother-in-law, but Arooj has a mother-in-law, and you know well what sort of 
a mother-in-law she is. Aunty Mehreen was already 
against Arooj, what was undone, that has been 
done by my planning. Now I have shown aunty the way, we will see if she reaches where I want her
to reach or not? And there is no chance of not 
reaching there. I have brought the destinations 
closer to her myself. Madam, sir is coming. Hmmm. Yes, mama, you had called me. 
All okay? I will tell you. Salman, I have made this decision 
after thinking hard. Whatever you are thinking cannot 
happen at any cost. Why can it not happen? 
You know… I just called you here to listen to me, 
and not to speak. What happened, Mehreen? What does Salman want that 
you cannot do? What is the need to adopt a child, what is the problem? The problem is in Arooj, not you. That is why I have decided, that you will get married again. What is the need to adopt a child, what is the problem? The problem is in Arooj, not you. That is why I have decided, that you will get married again. Does a woman not want to be 
a mother by choice? Why do people who know the will of God
in everything forget when they get to this point, that this is my God’s will. No woman has any fault in this. Is not becoming a mother 
a crime of a woman? And such a big crime, that she is dragged out of the home? This is my home too. I didn’t come here to leave. No one can drag me out of here. Will Salman bring another woman on me? No. No, no, this is not possible. Yes, yes, I have understood. 
I understand. No, we will talk on this topic 
when I come. Okay. Do you see Mehreen how she is taking advantage of 
our silence and doing what she wants. Shaista, today I will not ask you 
what you want to say, because you are right. If my thinking is correct, then it should be implemented. How will you implement it? I will fight for Arooj. I will talk to Salman. No, Mehreen is there to make 
Salman understand. But now I will make him understand. Okay, even if you make Salman understand,
it is Mehreen’s issue. How can we convince her? You leave that to me. Shaista, don’t do anything that will 
put Mehreen’s life in danger. Yes, so let it be in danger. Salman, really loves Mehreen, if something happens to her, 
then he can do anything. Wow. Here only Mehreen’s life is important. The life of others have no worth. You don’t need to interfere in 
Mehreen’s decision directly. Salman, I wanted to ask you something. Yes, go ahead. If you want to bring another woman 
in my place for the sake of a child, then give me poison or kill me, because I want to make the decision 
of my life myself. Arooj, do you think our lives 
are separate? You are the one separating me 
from your life, so what do I say? Who told you that 
I am separating you? Aunt Mehreen. Let her speak. What difference does it make? 
She talks a lot. It makes a difference. It surely makes a difference Salman, because you never ignore anything 
aunt Mehreen says. Arooj, maybe you are forgetting that I married you going 
against mama. Salman, I am really disturbed. I don’t understand anything. Arooj, why are you worried? Look, I am here. Everything will be fine. Trust me. I am stuck really bad. Such a weird situation. Control it a little or your business 
will face difficulty. How do I control it? You know, mama, 
she just wants a grandson. Let her insist, this is the story of every home. Man, if it was something small, 
I would have taken it easy. But things have gotten out of hands. What do you mean? She is talking about my second marriage. Oh, so that’s the thing. You know how worried Arooj was, the difficulty with which 
I took care of her? Man, Salman, you know 
why this is so complicated? Because aunty is really stubborn. 
Tell me, what will you do now? Man, I don’t understand anything. I really love Arooj, 
I cannot leave her. And aunty? Is this something you even have to ask? I am not asking you, 
I am reminding you of the problem you are getting stuck in. Man, I don’t understand, I love both of them a lot, I cannot break anyone’s heart. Now you tell me. Advise me. Right now I have no advice. It is just about waiting and watching. Have faith in God, buddy. Okay come on, relax. 
Let’s go to a coffee shop, then we will see. Where did it go? I don’t know. 
I don’t understand. Where can it go? Where can the things go? Oh. Aunty. I wanted to talk to you about something.
