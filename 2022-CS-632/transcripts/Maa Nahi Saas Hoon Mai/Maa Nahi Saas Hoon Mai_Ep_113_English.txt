Don’t worry, sister Mehreen. No matter how long the days 
of difficulty are, it is always followed by 
an evening of comfort. Master, I too have full faith, good times will definitely come. Tea. 
Thank you very much. Give me mine. What is the matter? How did you people come inside? This is a home of decent people,
 inspector. At least you people should seek 
permission before coming. We know well how decent 
you people are. Come with us to the police station. But why? What have I done?
 What is my fault? You will find out your fault 
when you go to the police station. Look you… Where are you taking him? 
Leave him. Show me the warrant, first. 
Leave him. What are you doing? What are you doing? You are taking him for no reason. 
Why? Sister Mehreen. Sister Naseema, 
you first go call Arooj. But… You go and call Arooj. 
I will see. You go ahead. After me and Arooj, you have become the enemy 
of innocent people like sister Naseema and 
master Shoaib. I didn’t do anything, and even if I have done something, then I am not answerable 
to your useless questions. I don’t want to make you answerable
 for anything, either. Just tell me, don’t you miss your mother? Don’t you miss her? I don’t have an answer for
these useless things. And don’t you dare follow me again. Now, move from here. I said, move from here. I know what he would have 
said to you. I know well. And I also know that you have brought up Salman 
really well. You have brought him up like 
an exemplary mother. But he has lost his way, mama and there is no way to return. As painful this is for you, it is equally painful for me as well. But I feel that the sooner the two of us 
will accept this, the better it will be for us. Papa? Are you fine? I am fine, child. Don’t worry. I will talk to them. Madam, what are you doing here? Why did you bring him here? He is my father. Madam, this is the police station. You only bring the ones 
who are criminals here. Really? What has he done? What is his crime? You ask this from the inspector, and don’t stand here. 
We get humiliated for no reason. Papa, I will do something.
Don’t worry. Fine, child. Wait madam, 
where are you going? Get out of my way. Move, 
let me go inside. Sir, I told her not to, 
she came in forcefully. Go ahead, madam. Can I know why you have 
locked up the master? He has kept a child against her will. We have a request against him. Child? What child? What is the name of that child? Name…what is the name? Yes. The name of that child is, Areej. Areej? Areej is my daughter. And the one you have locked up
is my father. We will find out about this, when there will be an inquiry and our job is to do the inquiry, 
not yours. Can I know who gave an application 
against us? Go, madam. 
Go. Sit outside. Let me do my work. Go. Take her away. Take her and make her sit. Come on, madam. 
Leave my hand. Inspector, can I know why you have 
locked up my father? And finding out about this 
is my right. You arrested him from home and right now you are telling me 
that your inquiry is not complete. So, when your inquiry is not complete, then why is my father locked up in jail? And it is also my right to know 
who gave an application against us. Look madam, this is a police station, and I am the SHO here. Whatever happens here is 
by my will. Rest, as far as your right 
is concerned, you will get it. Right now go 
outside and sit. Why have you not left till now? Madam, why are you standing here
 and staring at me? Take her and make her sit. Come on, madam. Leave my hand. Madam, sit here calmly and don’t try to get up 
from here again. Maula Baksh 
Yes? Keep an eye on her. 
Yes, madam. She shouldn’t come in the office. If we have to get Areej, then we will have to take help 
from the police or else Salman will never 
give us Areej. He is really stubborn. No sister Mehreen, we shouldn’t go to the police. Why, master? Master, what is wrong in this? We all know Salman is a stubborn
and crazy sort of boy. He will get angry with 
our police report. But this way, 
we will get Areej, right? You are right, sister Mehreen. But he can do anything 
in case of his failure. Anything. Salman can fall so low? Do he not have any sense 
of his own? Listening to your parents, you even forgot that I am your love. I am the honor of that home. I am the mother of your daughter. I wish, you would have come 
and seen that I am sitting on the bench 
of the police station. But God is seeing everything, 
Salman. Salman, son, intelligence 
calls for this that scaring is better than killing. Yes, I admit we made mistakes earlier, but now we are on the right track. And if master and Arooj are 
thinking of any proceedings, then they will quit the idea. 
You will see. They will quit. How will they not? They will have to. It is good that they understand or else I will get him imprisoned
 in such a case, that master Shoaib will be 
in jail for life, and Arooj will visit the courts for 
her father’s freedom. The SHO is calling. Attend it and put the phone 
on speaker. Hello. Yes, Mr. SHO. Mr. Salman, your work is done. Now tell me, 
what do we do next? Talk to dad. Yes, Mr. SHO. Sir, we have locked 
the master in jail, but his daughter has come and she is asking a lot of questions. Hey Mr. SHO, who can answer her 
questions better than you? Yes, you are absolutely right. Now tell me, what do we do next? Mr. SHO, whatever you have 
done is enough. Because right now we just want
to scare and threaten them. And you know this well. As you order. Very good. Now you will see, the condition these two will be in. You pushed my father? Huh? You pushed him? Push me.
Hit me. Why don’t you hit me? What do you think of yourself? What is this arrogance for? Respect.
Fame. Why are you quiet?
Speak up. Lower your voice. This is my home, you are not allowed to talk loudly here. I will talk loudly. And what is this home 
you are talking about? Two minutes. The ground from under your feet 
will be pulled in two minutes. Areej. Areej. You cannot take Areej. You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother. I will stop you.
Leave me. Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it. Leave it… Call that madam. Yes, sir. Madam. Sir is calling you inside. Sit. Okay, so you were talking about your right, that who gave the application? Why did we bring your father?
Why did we lock him in jail? These are all your questions, right? Look, you are decent people. I think that you let this matter go. All this is not something you people
 can deal with and you know this really well 
who did all this. If you still want to hear it from me,
 then hear it. This has been done by Mr. Idrees 
and his nephew, in fact, he turned out to be his son. Anyway, they did all this. Look madam, they are really
 powerful people and my advice to you is that you don’t mess with them. Look, whatever the matter is, end it or they will ruin your life. You know very well that 
we are innocent, and instead of orchestrating 
actions against those people, you are threatening me. No, no, you didn’t hear me correctly. You must have heard the idiom. One who holds the stick, 
owns the buffalo. These people are stick, 
and we are their buffalo. Look, take my advice and let it go. You take her, and leave her father from the lockup. Okay sir. Come madam. Thank you very much. But I want to say something to you. The Mr. Idrees you are talking about, he is my uncle, and Salman is my husband and I am the daughter of 
Waqar Ahmad. The one, on whose instructions 
you are doing all this, tell them, sticks keep on changing, God’s stick is silent. The day that stick is wielded, on that day, the entire city breaks
in a moment. Inform them. Thank you. Fayaz, let the master go. 
It is sir’s order. Okay. Maula Buksh. 
Yes. Take the keys and let him go.
