[22.12] Master, the gift God gave 
us in our childless life,
[30.80] it is time for that gift to depart.
[35.32] Master,
[37.20] when we had found 
her yesterday,
[40.52] it seems as though 
it was just yesterday.
[59.16] Master, stop the car.
[62.56] Stop the bike, master.
[63.84] What happened?
[65.52] I can hear a child cry.
[68.24] Huh?
[71.12] Hey, no,
[72.64] you must be hearing things.
[73.56] Hear it carefully, 
I can hear it.
[79.92] Yes, Naseema,
 I can hear it.
[83.52] You wait,
[86.24] I will go and see.
[91.56] Okay, you stay here.
[144.04] Naseema, you were right.
[145.96] See, I found a child.
[147.32] See, I had told you 
I could hear a child cry.
[150.84] Where did you find this
 child from?
[152.16] Hey, they were lying 
over there in the bushes.
[154.56] Lying in the bushes?
[156.24] Master,
[157.36] what sort of parents are they.
[159.08] They left the child like 
this in the bushes.
[161.84] God damn them.
[163.40] Master, what will do 
with this child?
[166.76] Lets go to the police station,
[169.28] we will give them this child.
[170.80] No, no,
[171.56] first we will take them home,
[173.16] I don’t know how long 
they must be hungry for.
[175.80] Yes, you are right.
[177.20] See how they became 
quiet coming in my arms.
[180.40] Okay here, take them,
 we will go.
[193.24] I tried everything
 I could that
[198.80] she goes back in the 
arms of her parents.
[207.08] I have tried hard to find out,
[211.40] but I couldn’t find anything.
[214.80] I also went to the spot where
 this child was found from,
[218.96] I even asked people over there,
[222.00] but no one knows 
anything about this girl.
[226.44] If you are not able to find out, 
then leave it.
[235.80] I will hand over this child to the police,
[239.88] they will find her parents themselves.
[241.92] Hey, no, no, master,
[243.68] what are you saying?She is Girl..
[247.88] I don’t know whose child she is,
[249.88] how can we keep this girl?
[253.20] If you give her to the police,
[257.16] then they will send 
her to the orphanage.
[263.20] You please let her stay with me.
[268.08] I will bring her up like my daughter.
[275.20] I don’t know where her 
poor mother would be?
[279.08] If her mother really 
worried for her,
[281.88] then she wouldn’t have thrown
 her like this and gone.
[284.80] Don’t say that, Naseema.
[286.60] Master,
[288.40] God has blessed us childless people 
with the blessing of a child.
[297.64] God has answered our prayers,
[301.08] why don’t you understand me.
[305.36] That’s it,
[306.16] I have told you,
[307.84] she is my daughter.
[311.48] Okay, look,
[314.36] the bracelet she has in her hands,
[317.48] in it, her name is Areej.
[322.28] I had thought that
[324.76] if we have a daughter,
[327.72] then I will name her Urooj.
[332.76] It is good.
[335.16] There is not a lot of difference 
in Areej and Urooj.
[337.88] That’s it, then.
[339.36] From today, she is our Urooj.
[343.56] Urooj.
[345.24] Urooj.
[357.04] Anyway,
[359.84] whatever God does is for the 
betterment of his servants.
[364.92] Thank God that
[370.16] he filled my empty arms like this.
[376.52] Thank God, Anyway,
[379.40] now you prepare for
 her to be sent off.
[449.48] Child, we tried our best that
[452.76] you never feel any pain,
[458.52] but still if something is left lacking
[461.52] then forgive us child.
[465.24] No…
[679.80] My name is Allah Wasai, madam.
[684.56] I have been working here for ages.
[689.36] If you ever need something,
[693.00] call out to me.
[698.40] Yes, sure.
[701.20] Allah Wasai,
[703.96] where is Salman?
[706.64] He is sitting with his friends,
[710.00] he will come shortly.
[715.36] Can I say something little madam?
[718.44] Yes.
[719.88] You are really pretty.
[724.24] May God give you a good fate.
[728.40] Thank you.
[730.40] I will go now.
[778.12] You must be really happy.
[787.68] But hear one thing clearly.
[794.96] You have trapped my 
Salman in your love,
[804.20] but your love
[807.16] cannot be more than a mother’s love.
[814.44] You can never snatch 
my Salman from me.
[853.48] Wasai,
[854.76] did you take out the 
milk in the glass?
[856.52] Yes, madam, here it is.
[858.64] Wasai,
[860.84] who is this milk for?
[862.60] For Salman.
[874.72] The thing that didn’t happen
 in the past twenty five years,
[877.16] why is it happening today?
[878.88] When everything about 
Salman is done with my will,
[881.28] then why have you still 
not understood it, Wasai?
[884.24] Madam had asked me.
[887.72] Why don’t you understand this,
 sister in law?
[889.96] When will you too understand this?
[927.48] What happened?
[931.12] Nothing.
[933.48] No,
[934.64] something has happened.
[936.76] I can see it clearly.
[941.88] There is nothing.
[945.72] Then what happened?
[952.40] Aunty came right now,
[955.80] she said that
[958.00] I trapped you in my love.
[965.40] Meaning,
[967.84] me loving you, is trapping you.
[975.08] Really?
[977.28] Did she say this to you?
[979.92] Yes.
[985.56] Why are you laughing?
[986.72] Obviously,
[988.04] I am laughing thinking 
that you love me.
[995.28] When did I say that?
[997.36] Just now.
[998.96] You accepted it just now.
[1006.08] You know, can I say something?
[1007.88] Yes.
[1010.16] You look even more 
beautiful laughing.
[1020.12] I forgot an important 
thing in all this.
[1023.20] Wait a second.
[1032.72] Here is your wedding gift.
[1072.28] How do you like it?
[1079.28] It is really beautiful.
[1081.88] Yes, it is beautiful.
[1085.88] But not more than you.
[1135.40] When will sister in law Shaista
 stop doing what she wants?
[1140.80] Why doesn’t she understand?
[1141.92] Why doesn’t she understand that
[1143.12] something so important about Salman
[1146.28] is being done without my will?
[1148.56] All these people have gone mad,
[1150.52] and they call me mad.
[1154.72] They will find out.
[1156.32] They will find out one day.
[1159.24] They will find out.
[1181.20] Salman,
[1185.40] can I ask you something?
[1188.80] Go ahead.
[1193.20] Did aunt Mehreen
[1195.80] have a problem with the
 love we have between us?
[1203.88] You didn’t answer me.
[1208.84] Can I say something?
[1210.16] Yes.
[1211.32] You wont mind, right?
[1213.88] No.
[1218.20] Actually,
[1220.88] the thing is that mom is really
 possessive towards me.
[1226.08] She doesn’t like sharing
 my love with anyone else.
[1237.92] What happened?
[1240.08] What are you thinking?
[1243.76] I am just trying to understand that
[1248.88] what is my fault in all this?
[1252.84] I am your wife.
[1256.16] Urooj, I know you are my wife,
[1259.32] and you have your 
own place in my life.
[1262.32] And trust me,
[1264.52] I have no objection 
on your rights.
[1269.52] If you don’t have an 
objection on my love,
[1273.08] and if anyone else has it,
[1275.52] then that is not my issue.
[1282.16] You are calling mom, anyone else?
[1285.92] Then aunty too should think that
[1289.48] I am not anyone else,
[1294.32] I am your wife.
[1297.72] Then remember one thing,
[1302.16] she is my mother
[1307.68] and don’t try to show your 
right on me in front of her.
[1316.84] She wont like it.
[1324.28] I hope you understood what I said.
[1369.56] Salman. Hey son, stop. Salman.
[1373.12] Salman.
[1376.92] Salman.
[1380.24] Salman.
[1384.60] Salman.
[1388.20] Salman.
[1400.80] Wasai. Wasai.
[1405.04] Why is madam calling me?
[1407.20] Yes, coming madam.
[1410.04] Wasai.
[1410.92] Yes. Yes, coming madam.
[1416.88] Yes, elder madam?
[1418.52] What happened?
[1419.96] Are you feeling okay?
[1423.76] Where is my Salman?
[1431.00] Why are you not answering me?
[1432.12] Say something?
[1433.68] Elder madam, he is in his room.
[1437.36] What is he doing there at this hour?
[1439.40] You are forgetting,
[1441.16] he got married today.
[1465.76] If you want, should 
I call madam?
[1469.80] No,
[1473.56] don’t send anyone.
[1476.04] No one at all.
[1477.96] Leave.
[1480.20] Go from here.
[1481.12] Okay.
[1494.96] My Salman…
[1501.00] my Salman got married
[1507.52] and I don’t even remember.
[1529.96] Here you go.
[1533.68] Yum.
[1534.28] How is it?
[1535.28] It is tasty.
[1537.32] Since when did you start 
having fried flatbread?
[1544.40] Mom,
[1547.84] Urooj made me try it. 
It is really delicious.
[1552.00] Wasai.
[1553.76] Yes, elder madam?
[1555.40] Have you forgotten the 
breakfast Salman has.
[1561.04] No, I will just bring it.
[1568.68] You know there is no harm in 
changing the taste some times.
[1574.00] No one has permission to 
bring change in my life.
[1583.52] Right, son Salman?
[1588.12] Yes, mama.
[1594.48] I just suggested it.
[1597.28] Urooj,
[1603.28] come to me when I see off, Salman.
[1609.32] I have to show you something.
[1612.92] Sure.
[1645.64] What happened to you?
[1649.08] Nothing happened right now,
[1651.88] I don’t know how long it 
is happening to me.
[1654.12] You once again want to 
talk about Mehreen and Salman?
[1657.28] I just don’t want to talk,
[1659.60] I want to scream.
[1661.92] I want to scream and tell everyone
 what I am going through.
[1665.16] Okay. Okay. Cool down.
[1666.88] Tell me, what is the matter?
[1670.28] Salman is my son,
[1673.24] who I had breastfed in childhood.
[1677.48] Mehreen didn’t like me taking 
a glass of milk for that same son?
[1684.12] She stopped me so badly that
[1686.68] I was shocked.
[1690.68] Yes,
[1691.92] Mehreen is like this 
regarding Salman.
[1695.60] Then what should I do?
[1697.72] What should I do?
[1699.56] How long do I stop myself?
[1703.72] We will be the only parents
 in the world,
[1706.96] who attended their own
 son’s wedding as guests.
[1715.72] Did I not plan anything 
being a mother?
[1726.04] I can understand the reason 
of you being upset.
[1729.68] You do one thing,
[1731.84] invite Salman and Urooj for a party.
[1735.64] Yes,
[1737.72] this will give your heart a little peace.
[1741.52] Okay?
[1747.92] Take care of yourself.
[1781.28] You had to show me something, 
aunty?
[1788.88] Yes.
[1793.12] Today I have to reveal some 
important secrets in life to you today.
[1797.92] Yes?
[1799.44] My Salman and I
[1802.32] are incomplete without each other.
[1807.72] I know that.
[1810.88] We must have heard two 
heart and one life.
[1817.64] Yes, I have heard it.
[1821.48] Good.
[1824.32] Come with me.
[1832.64] Only I take care of Salman’s things.
[1836.44] You must be thinking
[1838.44] why I do this?
[1842.16] So that
[1843.96] one day I can surprise my Salman.
[1850.12] But anyway,
[1851.84] why am I telling you all this?
[1855.60] Come on, let’s go forward.
[1880.24] Never open this room, Urooj.
[1884.96] Why?
[1887.44] What is there in it?
[1890.40] This is my Salman’s 
childhood room.
[1894.60] This has all of my Salman’s
 childhood toys,
[1898.88] with which he used to play.
[1901.88] It has all the toys that he
 got after insistence.
[1909.72] Even all those toys that
 broke on the first day,
[1914.96] and also those that
[1917.08] he would keep next to 
his pillow and sleep.
[1921.92] Remember one thing,
[1925.60] never make the mistake
 of opening this room.
[1983.60] What is the matter, Wasai?
[1984.80] Why all this?
[1987.80] Is there something special today?
[1989.56] Yes, yes,
[1990.28] today little master and little
 madam have a feast.
[1996.04] A feast in our home?
[1998.16] Yes.
[1999.36] What is this, Wasai?
[2005.32] I am sure, this is 
sister in law’s thought.
[2008.44] Yes, yes, elder madam,
[2010.24] madam had told me.
[2013.92] Fine.
[2015.52] I will take care of it.
[2017.72] How can anyone decide 
anything about my Salman.
[2023.16] My Salman is being 
invited for a feast,
[2025.40] and his mother doesn’t know.
[2028.12] It is so weird.
[2035.36] Send someone from the 
accounts, please.
[2038.48] Sure.
[2045.00] Yes, Shaista.
[2046.20] You just come early today…
[2047.96] Sister in law, Shaista,
[2049.88] what is this I hear?
[2051.48] You have organized a feast for Urooj 
and Salman, without my will.
[2055.60] You didn’t even bother asking me.
[2058.92] Hello. Hello.
[2061.16] You don’t say anything.
[2063.24] Let me talk her.
[2065.04] Idrees.
[2077.04] Yes, brother Idrees?
[2079.92] Mehreen, you know
[2082.16] how much Salman
 loves surprises.
[2084.84] So we thought that
[2087.20] your Salman will get happy.
[2090.16] I was just going to call you,
[2092.32] because we cannot invite Salman 
without your permission.
[2102.36] If you don’t want it then
[2104.20] I will say no to Shaista.
[2106.60] No, no, brother Idrees,
[2108.28] there is nothing like that.
[2109.84] I have no objection.
[2112.68] Yes, but brother Idrees,
[2114.40] I want to get the food my Salman
 likes cooked myself.
[2119.12] Why not? Why not?
[2120.24] As you wish. Whatever you will.
[2123.96] Thank you very much.
[2126.16] Thank you.
[2135.28] Hello.
[2136.76] Wasai.
[2140.32] What is the matter?
[2141.60] Why did you stop 
working? Huh?
[2143.64] Come on, quickly 
start working.
[2145.64] And yes,
[2146.52] there is minced meat for 
the kebabs in the fridge.
[2148.40] Take that out.
[2149.32] Prepare delicious kebabs,
[2151.56] and we will also make other
 delicious food too.
[2153.88] We will make all that will
 make my son happy.
[2156.80] Sure. Sure.
[2158.00] I will organize such a party
 for my son today,
[2160.08] that he will be left staring.
[2162.96] Come on, quickly start working.
[2164.52] Meanwhile, I will give Rehman 
baba the list of the other things,
[2167.40] we have to prepare a lot more.
[2168.88] Be quick.
[2169.88] Sure
[2189.84] Hello.
[2192.68] Yes, I handed over the file
 to your assistant.
[2195.96] Yes.
[2198.12] Alright, see you tomorrow. Bye.
[2202.88] How do I look?
[2206.40] As usual, really beautiful.
[2211.64] I just wanted to hear that.
[2215.72] Come on, get fresh,
[2217.04] aunt must be waiting for us.
[2220.20] Fine, I will go and get fresh.
[2222.04] Come quickly.
[2227.24] What is the matter Urooj?
[2230.08] Why are you so overdressed?
[2231.80] It is just an ordinary dinner at home.
[2235.00] Aunty, a party is a party
[2238.24] and then
[2239.12] aunt organized a diner with 
so much love for us,
[2242.28] so I need to dress up.
[2243.60] She called you with my agreement.
[2245.60] If I don’t allow it, then Salman 
wont even step there.
[2251.08] In future,
[2252.72] don’t wear such clothes that
[2255.16] Salman has to praise you.
[2258.24] Anyway,
[2259.88] you go, sister in law Shaista must
be waiting for you over dinner.
[2263.80] Till then I will check on Salman.
[2266.44] This boy doesn’t even take 
a single step without me.
