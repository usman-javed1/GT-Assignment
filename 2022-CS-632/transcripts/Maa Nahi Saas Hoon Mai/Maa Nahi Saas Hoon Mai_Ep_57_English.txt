Arooj, child. We have no one apart from you. A poor man like me could only 
give you good education. I did that. I just have this small home, that have I already put in your name. Apart from this, I have no other proof that I can tell you, that we have considered you 
our own daughter. Papa, please. Please, don’t say that.
Don’t say that. Arooj, child. Wasai. Yes, elder madam. Is your madam Arooj back? No. Fine. I will have to go myself. You ask the driver to take out the car. Sure. As you order. Wasai, where did Mehreen 
go with that stiff neck? She went to younger madam’s 
mother’s home. What? What did she go to do there? She was asking me 
why younger madam went to her mother’s home 
without informing anyone. Mehreen is a weird woman, she has gotten after Arooj. If Arooj is happy, why is she happy? If Arooj is sad, then why is she sad? This woman doesn’t even let 
anyone be sad properly. Wasai, you bring tea for me. Yes, madam. Oh wow, this madam Arooj is sitting 
in the feet of her parents after making our life 
and home hell. Hey, sister Mehreen, have a seat. Tell me, what happened? That good. Everyone is asking us 
what happened. Will someone ask her 
what happened? What is it about Arooj that 
you are so angry about? oh wow, Naseema, 
you are acting so naïve. All that my son and 
I are suffering from, it is all because of the upbringing 
you gave to this Arooj. You have a seat, and lower your voice. Your voice shouldn’t leave the home. Okay, the daughter of the home can leave
 the home without permission, but the voice cannot go out. 
This is a weird law you have. If you get upset like this, then how will you talk? The same way that I am talking right now. All of you people have driven my son mad. He has forgotten to be happy. And all this is because of this 
useless upbringing, Naseema. Aunty, you cannot talk to 
my mother like this. Arooj. Arooj, child. Mama. Mama, are you fine? 
Mama. Mama, what happened to you? 
Are you fine, mama? Arooj, I am waiting for you 
in the car, come immediately. Papa, look at mama. Mama. Arooj, child, you leave. After marriage, 
the home of the daughters is not their parent’s home, 
it is the home of her in-laws. I will take care of your mama. Go, child. A poor man like me could only 
give you good education. I did that. I just have this small home, that have I already put 
in your name. Apart from this, 
I have no other proof that I can tell you, that we have considered you 
our own daughter. Hello. Yes, Arooj. 
I am coming to get you. No, you don’t need to come now. What do you mean? 
Don’t you want to come? Meaning, I have come home. You have come home? 
With whom did you come home? Aunt Mehreen came, she brought me along. Arooj, what is going on? You left, you didn’t tell me. Mom brought you back, 
I don’t know. What am I after all? 
Who am I? All that my son and I 
are suffering from, it is all because of the upbringing 
you gave to this Arooj. You have a seat, 
and lower your voice. Your voice shouldn’t leave the home. Okay, the daughter of the home can leave
 the home without permission, but the voice cannot go out. 
This is a weird law you have. If you get upset like this, then how will you talk? The same way that 
I am talking right now. All of you people have 
driven my son mad. He has forgotten to be happy. And all this is because of this 
useless upbringing, Naseema. Aunty, you cannot talk to 
my mother like this. Arooj. Arooj, child. Mama. Mama, are you fine? 
Mama. Mama, what happened to you? 
Are you fine, mama? Arooj, I am waiting for you 
in the car, come immediately. I married Salman, so that my Salman remains happy
and my home becomes lively. How could my be lively? It has become lonely and 
Salman has gone crazy. Did you ask her Salman 
what she wants? She doesn’t have an answer
 to my question. Fine, then I will ask this madam myself. Look here towards me, Arooj. What reason do you have for making 
the environment of the home like this? Will you be quiet. This is the limit. Your court never ends. You always have a session of 
questions and answers all the time. What do you think of yourself? I don’t find it necessary to answer
any question of yours. You will remain completely 
quiet now! Did you see? Did you see, Salman? This is your mother’s respect, in the eyes of this Arooj. Did you see your mother 
get humiliated today? Why did you misbehave 
with mom? Arooj. I am asking you something, why did you misbehave with mom? Salman, please. Right now I am really worried. Don’t talk to me like this. Arooj, what is worrying you? I have been asking you for so long, 
you are not telling me anything. What happened? The style in which 
you are asking me, how will someone share 
anything with you? I am your husband, 
I can talk to you like this. You are my husband. 
I wish, had you kept the relationship 
of a husband then I would have shared everything 
in my heart with you. What do you mean? Don’t we have a relationship 
of trust between us? You ended that relation yourself. But this is not the answer 
of my question. Tell me, why did you misbehave 
with mom? I don’t want to answer any question 
of yours, now. Fine, then. There is no place for you 
in this home either. Get out of here. What are you doing? 
Leave me. Leave me. I say, leave me. Salman, I am saying, 
leave me. Where are you taking me?
Leave me. Salman, what are you doing?
Enough! No one will stop me. And no one dare come after me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Leave…
Get out of here. and don’t try to come back 
to this home again. Idrees, listen to me. Idrees, you make Salman, 
understand. Stop him. Go and bring Arooj. Where will she go alone 
so late at night? No one will go anywhere. Idrees, please. Why are you laughing? Obviously, I am laughing thinking 
that you love me. When did I say that? Just now. 
You just accepted it. Can I say something? Yes. You look even more beautiful 
when laughing. You are calling mom someone else? Then aunty too should think I am not someone else, I am your wife. Then remember one thing, she is my mother. And don’t try to show your right 
on me in front of her. She will not like it. I hope you understood what I said. Leave me. Leave me. Leave…
Get out of here. and don’t try to come back 
to this home again. I married Salman, so that my Salman remains happy
and my home becomes lively. How could my be lively? It has become lonely and 
Salman has gone crazy. Come on. Sit here, comfortably. Sit. Now tell me, 
what happened with you? You left at this time of the night. I didn’t leave, I was dragged out. What? What do you mean 
you were dragged out? Salman, pushed me out of the home. What are you saying? Did no one over there stop him? Salman was really angry. and what was the reason for his anger? I was not answering anything 
he was asking and you know well the reason
 for me not answering. If you are with Salman, 
then who is with me? I am alone. Hey, her dramas have started so that all of us pay attention 
towards her. I don’t want anyone to 
pay attention to me. Leave me alone. I want to be alone. Will you be quiet. This is the limit. Your court never ends. You always have a session of 
questions and answers all the time. What do you think of yourself? I don’t find it necessary to answer
any question of yours. You will remain completely 
quiet now! Arooj, what is worrying you? I have been asking you 
for so long, you are not telling me anything. 
What happened? The style in which 
you are asking me, how will someone share 
anything with you? I am your husband, 
I can talk to you like this. You are my husband. I wish, had you kept the relationship 
of a husband then I would have shared everything
in my heart with you. What do you mean? Don’t we have a relationship
 of trust between us? You ended that relation yourself. But this is not the answer 
of my question. Tell me, why did you misbehave 
with mom? I don’t want to answer any 
question of yours, now. I don’t know understand that even someone as educated 
as brother Salman can do this? No Shanzay, I don’t think Salman responsible
in all this. What? What are you saying? Brother Salman treated you this way and you don’t even think 
he is responsible? I got tired of what aunt Mehreen 
was saying and I shouted at Salman in my anger. So what does this mean? He will drag you out of the home 
on this?
