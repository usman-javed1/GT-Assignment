[41.28] Mehreen,
[43.00] how is Salman feeling now?
[46.32] He is fine now.
[48.08] He just slept.
[67.08] Okay, you go and sleep.
[69.44] I will sit with Salman.
[72.80] No,
[74.08] not at all.
[81.24] I don’t need anyone’s help 
to take care of my son.
[103.52] This woman’s behaviour is 
becoming intolerable.
[108.68] But what can I do,
[112.32] I am helpless.
[121.52] Mehreen, don’t insist. 
Rest a little.
[125.12] I will take Salman to my room.
[127.24] Even if you ask the same thing 
in a different manner,
[129.88] my answer will not change.
[131.60] It will remain the same.
[148.60] If the cuckoo bird leaves her children 
in a crow’s nest out of helplessness,
[154.12] still those children don’t grow up 
to be crows.
[379.36] Younger madam,
[382.36] why are you lying over here?
[385.16] Go and lie on the bed, there.
[387.96] This way, you will get a pain 
in your neck.
[394.12] It has been so many days, Wasai,
[397.56] that I have not been able to sleep.
[403.20] I was going to sleep,
[413.32] if you want tea or coffee,
[417.12] then let me know.
[419.16] I will make it.
[424.72] If I drink coffee, then I will not be 
able to sleep till morning.
[430.48] Fine,
[439.40] then I will go.
[441.04] Wait, Wasai.
[445.24] Sit, I want to talk to you.
[462.48] Yes?
[482.12] Something has been bothering me 
in my heart for the past few days.
[488.88] What is it?
[493.68] Wasai, do you remember,
[497.04] Salman had an accident.
[501.04] Yes,
[502.96] I remember it well.
[507.92] Even then,
[510.84] aunt Shaista was worried more 
than aunt Mehreen.
[520.76] That’s how it was, right?
[525.48] Yes,
[527.08] that’s absolutely how it was.
[532.88] And now, when Salman got shot,
[539.64] even now, aunt Shaista has 
the same behaviour.
[545.44] Madam really loves little master.
[555.20] Yes, but,
[558.40] Salman is adopted, right?
[570.84] Aunt Mehreen loving Salman is fine,
it is justified,
[580.40] she considers him her son
 unknowingly.
[585.08] But I don’t understand so much love
of aunt Shaista with Salman.
[607.72] There is another big reason for 
madam’s love for little master.
[622.40] Big reason?
[631.44] What is that?
[634.76] It is…
[648.76] Don’t worry, Wasai.
[657.76] Tell me openly, 
what the matter is.
[663.68] Little master is not the son 
of a distant relative.
[678.28] In fact, he is the son of madam 
and elder sir.
[719.44] So, you have found out.
[725.12] It is true, Arooj, child.
[736.68] So, if Salman is not 
aunt Mehreen’s son,
[741.32] then whose son is he?
[758.04] We have a relative,
[764.80] Salman is their son.
[834.96] Are you okay?
[837.60] Something really bad is going 
to happen, Shaista.
[841.68] What happened?
[844.92] Mehreen did what I feared, 
even after I told her not to.
[850.68] What did she do?
[852.20] What happened? Tell me.
[854.44] She has called Salman’s friend, 
who is an SP.
[858.28] The whole police party will be there.
[863.20] They have taken Mehreen, Salman, 
Arooj, everyone’s statement.
[910.68] What are you saying?
[913.84] I am right, madam.
[926.04] But you don’t become emotional.
[938.44] It is a question of elder madam’s life.
[946.08] Yes,
[952.16] but does Salman know this?
[956.44] No,
[958.76] little master doesn’t know anything.
[980.48] Fine, you can leave.
[987.00] Sure.
[1026.80] Does Salman know this?
[1034.40] He doesn’t
[1036.56] and neither does Mehreen.
[1042.96] If Mehreen finds out this truth,
[1049.16] she will not be able to tolerate 
this mental shock,
[1055.20] and if
[1057.68] Salman finds out this truth,
[1061.76] then her personality will 
get shattered.
[1070.24] Meaning…
[1073.92] I don’t understand…I mean,
[1079.44] the whole family is acting and lying, 
including Wasai.
[1085.64] Yes, child and I want that
[1089.44] you too support us
[1094.76] and stay quiet.
[1096.72] You will not tell anyone this truth.
[1100.44] Can you do that for me?
[1108.00] But still no one is ready to call 
aunt Mehreen wrong.
[1112.00] You tried speaking the truth, right?
[1114.76] Was Mehreen able to tolerate it?
[1118.44] If your relation with relations 
doesn’t remain,
[1121.72] it is a heavy truth.
[1124.28] Okay, whatever happened, 
happened.
[1126.80] Be careful in future, okay?
[1132.20] There, that poor Salman is 
also worried.
[1137.32] And Arooj, please, 
for God’s sake,
[1141.32] you will not reveal this secret
in front of Salman.
[1149.16] I will be able to tolerate the suffering
of Mehreen’s pain,
[1153.84] but I cannot see Salman suffering.
[1160.60] Promise me, 
that you won’t tell anyone.
[1166.72] Hmmm.
[1170.28] So this is that distant relation,
[1176.68] who lives in the same home.
[1187.40] Salman turned out to be
 uncle’s son.
[1198.52] Meaning, uncle cunningly took 
advantage of mama’s health,
[1204.80] mental condition and me 
going missing,
[1213.44] and put Salman in her lap.
[1226.24] And then he put all the wealth 
in her lap.
[1237.36] Uncle turned out to be 
a big planner.
[1249.80] Now, I will untangle 
this entangled story.
[1261.36] Uncle,
[1265.76] the end of your story is not far now.
[1351.52] This is not good at all.
[1354.68] The circle is getting smaller 
around us
[1363.28] and I fear that
[1364.96] the police might be able to 
find out everything.
[1377.60] If, we get caught,
[1386.00] then everyone will find out that 
the bullet was fired on my orders.
[1403.12] No.
[1435.84] Hey, pick up the phone, 
where the hell are you?
[1450.76] Sir is calling. Wait, 
I will come.
[1462.88] Go ahead, sir.
[1464.08] Hey, where the hell were you?
[1465.88] I would have gotten caught,
 I just got saved.
[1468.96] What nonsense is this?
[1471.08] I called you because the FIR 
has been filed
[1475.08] and the police will find you.
[1480.96] They will find me?
[1482.28] The police raided my home.
[1484.92] I ran away saving my life 
with difficulty.
[1489.12] Get killed, but don’t get caught.
 Understand?
[1500.64] What is wrong, sir?
[1502.84] I don’t take your name and 
I give my life. Wow, just wow.
[1507.48] Okay fine, get angry.
[1509.32] You do one thing, leave the city, 
go somewhere far.
[1519.00] How do I leave?
[1520.28] I don’t have a single penny 
in my pocket.
[1522.80] I need more money sir.
[1525.08] Fine. Fine. You will get money.
[1527.84] But don’t get caught by the police.
Don’t get caught.
[1532.52] Fine.
[1633.76] Greetings.
[1635.12] Greetings. 
Come, sit here.
[1638.20] You should have asked me, 
I am here.
[1640.72] Sit comfortably.
[1646.92] You are fine, right?
[1649.36] I am fine.
[1650.52] Thank God.
[1652.40] You don’t have to do anything 
with me around. Got it?
[1655.52] Yes, yes, son.
[1657.64] All of us will take care of you.
All of us.
[1662.52] Yes.
[1668.24] All of us will take care,
[1678.44] but the way Salman’s mother 
can take care of her,
[1682.44] no one can pay so much attention
 towards Salman.
[1703.60] And I doubt someone can care for 
Salman as much as aunt Mehreen.
[1727.96] Right, aunt Shaista?
[1740.08] I too was saying the same thing,
[1742.40] that all of us should take care 
of Salman. That’s it.
[1751.52] Salman shouldn’t worry 
about anything.
[1755.96] Absolutely.
[1774.24] Salman, I am getting a call 
from your office.
[1778.08] Give it to me.
[1779.56] There is no need to do the office work 
till you get fine.
[1783.32] Do you understand?
[1795.60] And you will not step foot out of 
this home without my permission.
[1802.88] Mom, I am not going to the office,
[1805.24] there were a few documents
[1807.24] that I had to send to the office, 
that is why I had to talk on a call.
[1810.68] Okay fine, answer it.
[1825.08] You don’t know,
[1827.80] what a mother’s heart goes through.
[1846.16] Phone.
[1848.40] Attend the phone.
[1852.08] Elder madam,
[1854.28] breakfast is served.
[1856.12] Everyone, come on.
[1857.40] Fine, Wasai, go ahead,
we are coming.
[1868.48] Shall we go for breakfast?
[1870.32] Come on, get up. Careful.
[1873.52] Careful.
[2007.76] Where is Salman?
[2010.72] He must be in Mehreen’s room.
[2014.92] Good.
[2016.76] He should be where he can be 
taken care of the most.
[2021.88] Meaning?
[2023.80] Meaning, you turned to be 
so cunning
[2026.52] even when you were not 
paying attention,
[2028.32] that you ducked 
in front of the bullet
[2030.24] and the bullet hit Salman.
[2037.12] I didn’t understand one thing.
[2039.72] Aunt Mehreen is worried
[2042.88] because she is Salman’s mother.
[2050.04] But,
[2052.80] why are you so worried on 
Salman getting shot?
