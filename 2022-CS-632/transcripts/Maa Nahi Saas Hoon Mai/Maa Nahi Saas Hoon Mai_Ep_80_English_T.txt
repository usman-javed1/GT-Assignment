[69.00] Aunt?
[86.36] I just randomly got
a question in my mind.
[102.44] Why do you get so
uncomfortable when you see...
[106.00] the love between Salman
and his Mom?
[123.60] Now look,
[125.96] the love between a son
and his mother is like that
[154.32] but what do you know,
[157.72] you don’t have any child.
[198.60] It looks like
[202.16] you want to say something.
[207.60] I don’t want to say anything.
[223.24] Really?
[226.72] Then I guess
[229.04] you want to ask something.
[236.16] I don’t want to ask
anything from you.
[241.56] okay
[243.48] then let me ask.
[248.84] Aunt Mehreen didn’t have a child,
[253.16] so you adopted a child and
gave it to her.
[303.88] But you didn’t do that,
[318.12] why?
[324.72] Though you are childless too.
[341.00] What you did was good.
[398.68] It is fine until now but
[401.20] it won’t be fine for very long.
[403.32] Hey,
[404.36] at least tell me what happened.
[409.28] Arooj has heard everything
we were talking about.
[414.80] This was the reason
I used to tell you to
[416.80] not talk about this over
and over again.
[419.52] This is not the time to
get angry at me.
[422.16] For now tell me,
what should we do next?
[424.64] What trouble have
you gotten me into?
[430.80] Arooj shouldn’t find out
anything else,
[433.28] and the thing that has gotten
into her knowledge,
[435.08] she will have to stay silent on
what is it and why is it.
[437.60] What if she insists on knowing?
[439.96] Just keep on ignoring it
no matter what happens.
[443.28] And what if she asks Salman?
[445.44] You will restrict Arooj
from asking Salman,
[449.24] no matter what happens,
[451.24] it is your responsibility.
[479.36] Do you care about anything?
[481.20] It has been an entire day
[483.32] and Arooj hasn’t come home yet.
[487.16] Sister in law, what is there to
get so worried about?
[490.32] She might have gone
to her Mom’s house.
[496.72] Yes, that is possible
[499.80] but what if this is not the case?
[502.84] Sister in law, what can I do then?
[505.48] She is not a kid.
[508.20] I wish you were
a mother of a daughter,
[510.44] you would have
understood it well.
[514.08] Mother of a daughter?
[517.52] You are not a mother,
[519.88] in fact you are not a mother at all,
[524.48] I have still given birth to Salman,
[527.80] so please, sister-in-law,
[529.92] please don’t give me a lecture
to understand this pain.
[692.28] You haven’t gone to
the office yet?
[694.32] You didn’t even come
to the breakfast table.
[707.20] I am very scared, Shaista.
[716.76] The work didn’t get done and then
[718.12] there is also danger on my head.
[724.64] Did that shooter get caught?
[727.92] No, he didn’t get caught, but
[729.72] we can get the news anytime,
[736.44] police is raiding at places.
[742.76] But you gave him money
[744.60] and asked him to run
away from here.
[746.60] Yes, I did but he
couldn’t run away.
[748.20] DIG has put a curfew
in the whole city.
[751.68] oh my God,
[754.92] so now what will happen?
[760.04] We might get exposed.
[763.60] Anything can happen.
[765.40] I wish he doesn’t get caught
and if he does,
[767.84] I just hope he gets killed in
a police encounter else he
[769.64] will take my name,
[770.92] and I will have to suffer
in prison all my life,
[774.28] I don’t want that.
[812.44] I am going to the office.
[828.08] This business, property, and wealth,
[832.36] I am the owner of all of it
[835.80] and I have got to know this very well.
[840.52] So I suggest you
[844.16] stop dreaming about it,
[849.28] it will just take me
a visit to the court,
[854.00] the plan you made for 25 years,
[860.24] and I will destroy it in minutes.
[864.24] So the result of everything
[868.12] I said is that stay away
from my husband,...
[870.28] my mother, and
my daughter’s life,
[873.96] it will be better for you.
[905.00] Areej, this is my Areej,
[908.04] my little, my love Areej.
[910.44] Okay, okay. Baby,
[912.48] oh baby.
[916.56] you have taken
a good decision, Salman.
[921.84] What decision, Mom?
[923.60] That you gave Areej to me.
[931.80] I really like playing with her.
[938.44] Mom, it wasn’t my decision
[940.96] but Arooj’s.
[950.44] She gave Areej to you
without even asking me.
[954.28] Okay,
[955.60] whoever’s decision it was,
[957.40] but I get happy.
[967.52] Should I tell you something?
[969.28] Areej looks at me with
so much concentration.
[979.68] Everything she does
gets to my heart.
[986.08] Mom, tell me something.
[990.00] Hmm?
[992.92] Did you like the name
Areej more or Dad?
[1012.28] I or Waqar?
[1026.72] Who liked this name?
[1037.88] But why it was there,
[1050.00] I don’t remember anything, Salman.
[1063.68] I don’t know who we named Areej.
[1073.44] That means,
[1077.32] there was someone named Areej.
[1090.84] Now who was it,
[1093.80] you don’t remember that.
[1097.80] Here is Areej,
[1099.52] your daughter,
[1107.16] her name is Areej, right?
[1109.80] Areej my love.
[1113.76] That means you
[1117.16] don’t know any Areej
apart from this one?
[1134.92] I don’t know
[1137.44] if I know or not but yes,
[1147.64] I feel that I have heard this
name somewhere.
[1171.48] And the Areej that
I visualize is exactly like her,
[1188.32] very little
[1190.56] and lovely Areej.
[1213.20] This is my Areej.
[1303.68] Wasai, don’t you have
power in your hands?
[1306.64] Massage it hard,
[1308.40] my head hurts so bad.
[1310.84] Madam, it will hurt,
[1319.08] you overthink a lot.
[1328.28] Though nothing will happen
by all this overthinking.
[1333.52] What do you mean?
[1335.56] I mean that,
[1337.52] only what God wants, will happen.
[1346.64] May God forgive,
[1348.12] my grandma used to say that
[1353.60] it is foolishness to be adamant
on what’s wrong, not bravery.
[1371.60] What are you trying to say? Yeah?
[1374.84] What will I say?
[1379.44] I just want to say that
[1382.40] if there is a chance,
[1385.12] just save your life and run away.
[1390.88] For now, you must
run away from here.
[1393.64] My brain is already messed up,
[1395.24] don’t push it.
[1413.12] You are very clever,
[1416.40] you always used to be with Arooj,
[1419.84] show her love,
[1422.40] you didn’t burn that picture
despite me asking you to,
[1425.64] you kept it with you instead
[1427.96] so you can show it to Arooj?
[1429.92] Yeah?
[1432.08] You should be ashamed.
[1435.40] You are such a big traitor,
[1443.20] get out of my sight.
[1445.28] And yes,
[1449.36] if I even see you near Arooj,
[1453.80] you will always remember
what I do to you.
[1458.36] Go away.
[1464.04] Your brain will mess up,
[1470.20] a person reaps what they sow.
[1483.64] What are you thinking?
[1484.72] You are still standing on my head.
[1486.48] Go away from here.
[1488.36] Okay madam.
[1503.04] You haven’t gone to
the office yet?
[1505.20] You didn’t even come
to the breakfast table.
[1508.44] I am very scared, Shaista.
[1511.00] The work didn’t get done and then
[1512.40] there is also danger on my head.
[1519.04] Did that shooter get caught?
[1522.56] No, he didn’t get caught, but
[1524.24] we can get the news anytime,
[1527.00] police is raiding at places.
[1530.68] But you gave him money
[1532.56] and asked him to run
away from here.
[1534.48] Yes, I did but he couldn’t run away.
[1536.04] DIG has put a curfew
in the whole city.
[1539.56] oh my God,
[1542.96] so now what will happen?
[1547.92] We might get exposed.
[1551.52] Anything can happen.
[1553.28] I wish he doesn’t get caught
[1554.52] and if he does,
[1555.64] I just hope he gets killed
in a police encounter
[1556.96] else he will take my name,
[1558.60] and I will have to suffer
in prison all my life,
[1562.24] I don’t want that.
[1628.24] Aunt?
[1630.68] I just randomly got
a question in my mind.
[1634.80] Why do you get so
uncomfortable when you see ...
[1638.84] ...the love between Salman
and his Mom?
[1649.76] Now look,
[1652.08] the love between a son and
his mother is like that
[1668.20] but what do you know,
[1671.76] you don’t have any child.
[1679.08] It looks like you want
to say something.
[1719.04] I don’t want to say anything.
[1724.24] okay then let me ask.
[1731.56] Aunt Mehreen didn’t have a child,
[1736.00] so you adopted a child
and gave it to her.
[1758.68] But you didn’t do that,
[1766.00] why?
[1769.72] Though you are childless too.
[1835.52] Aunt?
[1859.36] Why have you come here?
[1861.60] Just like that.
[1870.12] I got a thought so I thought
of sharing it with you.
[1875.52] Really?
[1877.72] What thoughts did you get now?
[1882.96] Aunt, Salman got shot,
[1900.36] so ethically we should have
informed her mother,
[1912.04] the same mother,
[1913.80] the far relative,
[1925.52] the one whom you
adopted Salman from.
[1928.68] That is what you told me, right?
[1931.08] Remember?
[1936.36] What is this time to talk
about this?
[1938.84] Hey this is the right time
to talk about this.
[1949.56] In fact, I feel
[1951.92] we have been quite late
to inform his mother.
[1959.88] You have come here to talk about
these nonsensical things?
[1964.52] These are not nonsensical things.
[1979.08] Oh, sorry sorry sorry,
[1981.48] now I understand,
[1983.40] Salman shouldn’t find out that
[1987.04] he is not Aunt Mehreen’s son
[2001.08] because if Salman’s actual mother finds
out that Salman was shot,
[2005.64] poor woman will come crying
here to hug her son
[2020.80] and if that happens,
[2024.04] your entire plan will be flopped.
