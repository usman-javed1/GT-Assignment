You are back? I am that is why you can see me. what happened? 
You called me so many times, is everything okay? No, nothing is okay. What happened Urooj? Come in, I will tell you. tell me what happened? Is everything okay? I said come in I will tell you. Let’s go. Happy Birthday. You remember my birthday? Hmm. Impressive, I didn’t remember at all. The ones you love you must remember everything 
about them. Thank you so much. You’re welcome. I think let’s cut the cake, the poor cake
has been waiting for you for so long. Come. How did you like the cake? Very beautiful and yummy as well. Ready? Yep. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Salman, Happy Birthday to you. Thank you so much. Take it. Now I will feed you. Happy Birthday. Thank you so much. You’re welcome. And here is your birthday present. What is this? Look at it yourself. For you. It’s beautiful. Won’t you make me wear it? 
Why not? Wait a second. Salman, do you know why have I 
gifted you this watch? Hmm, why? So that next time you can look at the time 
and come home early. In fact, there is another special thing 
about this watch. Really what’s that? I have set everyone’s birthday alarm
 in this watch. Really? But I am not interested in remembering 
anyone’s birthday, I just want to remember your birthday. I knew it. That is why there is just mine and 
your reminder set in this watch. Really? 
Hmm. Thank you so much, 
Urooj for making my day. You know what? I love you so much. I love you too. Good Morning. Good Morning, Good morning. Come, let’s have breakfast. Mom, actually I had my breakfast 
in the room only because I was getting late for work. Where did you get this from? I never saw it on your hands 
ever before. This, Urooj has gifted this. Oh okay, Urooj has gifted it? 
But why? I mean there must be an occasion 
to gift something. Mom, it is my birthday today, did you forget? I? No… not at all. Why would I forget? Look, I knew you can never 
forget this day. After all, how can I forget? Umm, show it to me. Watch? 
Hmm. Look. Do you like it? Hmm, it is not very special, I mean that Urooj’s choice 
is not very good, her choice is very ordinary. It means you didn’t like it. No, like I said, it is just okay. okay I am getting late for office; I will see you tonight. Take care. Take care. Bye. How can I forget it? You?
Hmm. You didn’t come for breakfast so I thought
that I should go and check myself. How are you? I am fine. Hmm, I can see that. And I guess you are more than just fine but it is wrong to be even more than fine. I don’t understand what you are saying. It will take you a lot of time to understand 
the relationship between myself and my Salman. As far as I have understood, I think that there is more than 
usual mother-son love, and I like that you guys are so attracted 
towards each other. Wrong, I just told you that acting nicer than 
required is also equal to being bad, anyway, leave all this, I just came to ask why didn’t you come 
down for breakfast with Salman? There wasn’t any special reason, Salman had to leave early today 
so that is why. Hmm. That is what I wanted to hear. You gifted a watch to Salman but to win Salman’s heart you have 
to match your time with his time. Gifting watches doesn’t help. Madam? What happened? 
Do you want to say something? I am just scared to talk big 
with this small mouth. No, tell me what is it? Madam, Madam Jr is very nice, 
she really loves Sir. Okay so that is great, what problem do you have with it? No madam, I don’t have a problem, 
she has a problem… I know that you are talking 
about Mehreen. What can I do? Your sir has stopped me. Now look, Sir and Madam Jr cannot get away 
with Madam Sr’s eyes even in their room. I feel so pity for madam Jr, now look she has just 
newly gotten married and the same old mother-in-law 
and daughter in law games. Are you done talking? No, no madam, I told you because 
you asked me to tell. Look Wasai, I am already very worried 
because of all this, now these talks are making 
my heart heavier. Now go and do your work. Madam, don’t worry, God will make everything fine, I will go make cold sorbet for you. So how did brother Salman 
like your gift? Salman really like it but… What but Urooj, we have nothing to do with people
after that but. Yes, but we get to interact with them, and Salman and I don’t have 
personal life anyway. It means aunt Mehreen turned out 
to be a typical mother-in-law? In fact, she is even worse than 
a typical mother-in-law. At least other mothers-in-law give their 
sons and daughter in laws a chance to breath, she doesn’t even do that. So Urooj, you must talk to 
brother Salman about this. What should I say to Salman, Shanzey? Do you know I am even scared to talk 
to Salman about aunt Mehreen, he gets crazy in a second 
and he gets angry then I don’t know what should I do. Do you know the craze he had to get me; I get to see that very rarely now. Why? Where did the hero’s craze go? God knows. Looks like there is a problem going on,
my friend. I can solve the problem but I am unable to get hold of the problem. According to my inexperience, 
are you laughing right now? Are you stupid? I would laugh at such a serious conversation, 
Shanzey? Come on, dude. Good, so you just need to get hold 
of brother Salman’s love. May I come in? 
Yes, yes please. Come in. Sit, sit. 
No, no, first you sit down. Urooj, my child, 
you are a very nice girl, you are so loving. Thank God, at least someone realized it, else, aunt Mehreen does not think 
about this at all. My child, you must not talk what 
Mehreen says personally to your heart. She attacks on the heart every time, how can you save yourself? That is how Mehreen is, we are tolerating her in this house, you must do it too. But I am tolerating all this 
for Salman, aunt. I know that, you just focus on your own life, stay happy. Hmm? And remember one thing, I am always with you. Your support is my strength else I would have shattered 
long time back. Mom, actually I had my breakfast 
in the room only because I was getting late for work. Where did you get this from? I never saw it on your hands ever before. This, Urooj has gifted this. Oh okay, Urooj has gifted it? 
But why? I mean there must be an occasion 
to gift something. Mom, it is my birthday today, did you forget? Urooj as celebrated Salman’s birthday
before me today, what does she think? She will take my place in Salman’s 
heart by doing that? Salman is my son, he is just my son. I will give such a gift to Salman today that all other gifts will become 
unimportant in front of it. Did you tell Mr. Akmal about 
tomorrow’s meeting? yes, I have made arrangements, 
they are just waiting for you. Okay, you may go I will come. Sir. Hello? I hope you weren’t busy. Busy? Yes, I am busy, I was just going for a meeting. hmm, that means you are busy? Urooj, you are unbelievable, I am getting late for a meeting. So, then you are busy. Obviously, now if you may allow, 
may I go for the meeting? Umm, wait a minute, by the way I have called 
for some work too. What is that work? 
Tell me? Umm, what is the time right now? Time? It’s 4 o clock. Thank you, I just wanted to ask that. Take care. Bye. Wasai? Wasai? yes, madam Sr? I am here. Wasai, go and bring the keys 
to the store room. Keys to the store room? 
Is everything okay, madam? Yes, everything is fine. There is a Salman’s toy from 
his very first birthday, bring that. But all Sir Salman’s things are 
scattered in the store room, how will I recognize it? Teddy bear. Teddy bear? Okay, okay I get it, I will bring it. wait, I will come with you, you might damage his other toys. Come, let’s go. Stop. Where are you going? I had some work downstairs, 
that is why. I asked you not to go to that side, why are you going there? You know there is a store room there. There might be, 
I guess I don’t know. There might? There is. There is no need to go there 
now go away from here. Okay. Now if you go away only then 
I can go down. I can only go there if you move. Okay. I have even stopped her and told her she has nothing 
to do with the store room, there are just treasures of memories
of me and my Salman and today, I have to give 
Salman a surprise that… Wasai, where are you? 
Come already. yes, yes, madam, coming. 
Come quickly. Wasai, give me the keys. Okay madam. Look at the condition of this place. It is not here. Where would it be? What are you looking for, madam? Wasai, you will just find it out, 
you will just find it out. I asked you not to go to that side, why are you going there? You know there is store room there. There is no need to go there 
now go away from here. Like it’s not a store room 
but a secret basement, God knows what is buried there. Who opened the door of this room today? Uff! If Mehreen sees it… Mehreen, what are you doing here? First you tell me, 
what are you doing here? nd look please, don’t touch anything. I cannot find it. This here… God forbid, look at the condition of this place. 
Hold this Wasai. You should come and sometimes 
see this place and clean it. You never take care of it. This picture? Take this picture quickly, 
go throw it. Oh God. This? This? Where did Wasai go? She went to throw away the picture frame. Why sister-in-law? 
Why did she go to throw it? There might be some old memorable 
picture of my Salman. No Mehreen, it had no picture, it was just an empty frame and there were 
termites in it so I got it thrown away. Okay, you did well but why can’t I find it? I should be able to find it 
I kept it here only. After all, what are you looking 
for Mehreen? Sister-in-law, you will get to know it, 
everyone will get to know it, you will see that everyone will 
get to know that but I should find it. I should be able to see it here
in front of me. It was so beautiful. Did you throw that frame? Yes madam, I threw it outside. Yes, don’t take it home, 
it had termites. no madam, you know I don’t take anything 
from here to my home. I did as you asked me to. Okay you may go. 
Okay. Keep sitting. Miss Sadia, you will hit the construction site 
from today onwards. okay sir. If you have any kind of problem or you need to discuss anything, 
you can discuss it with me. Okay sir. This project is very important 
for all of us, I won’t tolerate any slacking in it 
of any sort. Is that all right? Don’t worry, sir, you won’t get 
a chance to complain. And Mr. Nawaz? Yes? Because you are heading 
the finance department, make sure payments are made in time. yes sir. There shouldn’t be any delay. If you face any problem with funding, 
if there is any sort of issue, you can call me anytime. Okay sir. And one more thing, 
if we succeed in this project, you all will get a double bonus. You may go now. 
Thank you, sir. Wasai, tell me how did termites get to 
the things of my Salman? Yes? I have hired you here to slack? Who will take care of my son’s things? If next time this happens, I will kill you know how dear are 
my Salman’s things are for me? Yes, madam Sr. What madam? Always. Mehreen, what is wrong? 
Why are you getting angry? I am scolding Wasai, because of her termites have gotten
to the things of my Salman and then she threw it in the trash too. So, only you told me that 
it has mites in it and the glass is broken too 
so throw it away, so she threw it away. I said so? How can I say that and that too 
for my Salman’s things. You said it in front of me. Anyway, leave that look at this, do you remember this? This was Salman’s first toy. It is so nice, right? I was looking for this and
 I couldn’t find it. It was kept in my cupboard. Wasai, go and make tea for me 
and Mehreen. Okay. Let me just, let me just call Salman 
right now. Let me give him a surprise. Thank you, sister-in-law. Madam Sr and sir Sr, were so beautiful when young, madam Sr became a widow 
while she was still young, it is all about fate, she birthed a daughter 6 years 
after her marriage and that too went missing, that was such a sad incident. It is madam’s orders to burn this picture, what should I do? I have to obey the orders. It is such a negative thing to burn 
the picture of someone who is still alive. Sir Sr is not alive but madam Sr is still alive and her daughter Areej 
might be alive too. No, no I can never burn this picture, but I have been ordered 
to burn the picture, what should I do now? Let me just hide this picture, yes, let me just hide it. You? You come to my room like this again 
and again, I don’t like it at all aunt, you are my elder, you should ask Wasai and 
she will call me. I will do that from next time but this time it was important 
for me to come. Okay, tell me? I am here to invite you. What invitation. Today is my son’s birthday, get ready and come down 
in a while. Okay. Umm, do you have that to wrap the gift… no, you just leave it, 
I don’t need it, just don’t miss my son’s birthday. My son’s gift, after all her mother found it, after all how wouldn’t she find it? yeah? My Salman would be so happy 
to see his gift but how can I show it to him like this? It won’t look nice like this, it should be gift wrapped, what should I do? Where should I get the gift wrap from?
I should ask someone to get it. But it will take very long for me 
to ask someone to get it. What should I do? 
Where should I look for it? It might be in my cupboard. 
Let me find it. Wasai? yes madam? Wasai, go and give these things 
to Aunt Mehreen, please. But what is all this for madam? She needs these things; she just shouldn’t get to know 
that I have sent it for her. You will give it to her, right? Don’t worry madam, has it ever happened that my madam 
asked me to do something and I wouldn’t do it? here. Okay listen, I am waiting for you here, once you give this to aunt, 
so do let me know. Don’t worry, I will be right back. Come soon.
