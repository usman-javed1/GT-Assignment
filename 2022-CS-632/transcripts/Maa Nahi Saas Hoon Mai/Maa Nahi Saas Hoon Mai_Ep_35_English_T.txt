[29.52] Salman.
[35.76] What is the matter, son?
[37.76] Where are you leaving so early in
the morning without having breakfast?
[41.12] I am going to the office,
[42.64] I will have breakfast there.
[46.40] You look worried to me.
[50.88] No, I have no worry.
[53.36] First, you should tell everything
to your mother,
[61.56] but fine,
[62.92] if you want to hide it,
then up to you.
[69.36] But Salman, think about one thing.
[75.92] Since you have been married,
[83.52] since then you have
started to stay worried.
[96.76] Goodbye.
[98.56] Goodbye.
[113.00] Nothing has happened till now,
[114.96] but I am scared it will
surely happen now.
[118.48] What will happen?
[119.80] Something really bad.
[123.20] If you don’t stop putting poison in
Salman’s heart towards Arooj.
[129.76] What did I do?
[131.72] Please, Mehreen,
[133.60] I know it all.
[135.68] I had stopped you that whatever
you are thinking is wrong
[139.56] and I have to save Salman
from this wrong thinking of yours.
[143.28] But you did what you wanted.
[182.92] Come in.
[188.92] Wasai,
[190.44] once Arooj leaves her room,
[192.28] then tell me.
[193.56] Sure.
[203.48] What happened yesterday?
[205.16] Where did Wasai take you?
[209.76] Is there any point in telling you.
[214.04] If I find out the issue,
then we will decide
[216.12] if there is a point or not,
[217.12] or will you make all the
decisions yourself?
[223.52] Salman and Arooj had
a misunderstanding,
[227.72] I was clearing it out.
[231.12] Why did you go?
[232.68] What do you mean,
why did I do?
[235.44] Is it forbidden to make
children understand?
[239.24] If children make mistakes in anger,
in their stupidity,
[244.48] if they become stubborn,
[245.64] they become overconfident,
[247.56] then isn’t it our responsibility...
[248.96] ... making them understand and
showing him the right path?
[251.68] These philosophy and
statements of responsibility
[254.08] makes no difference to Mehreen.
[257.56] Had she come there
and seen you
[259.68] and told you stay away from
Salman’s matters, then
[262.44] wouldn’t things have gotten bad?
[263.48] So how could she see it?
[265.72] She is the one who started this fire.
[271.04] And after all,
[272.52] if me, Salman’s real
mother sort out ...
[275.28] ...the issues between
Salman and Arooj,
[277.32] then who will?
[281.12] And how long do I let my son suffer
because of Mehreen’s stupidity?
[286.76] We cannot say this openly.
[289.40] But we can call for truce during
the call for war, right?
[296.08] We are elders,
[298.12] don’t we have a right?
[302.24] We don’t fulfill our
responsibility?
[303.84] should we not act smart?
[308.00] Fine, keep it up. I will go.
[344.08] Boss, you called for poor old me?
[346.12] Come. Come. Come.
[347.40] Now you will not stay poor.
[350.32] You look really happy.
[352.12] What scheme did you
get your hands on?
[356.12] The matters with AAZ Advertising
have been fixed.
[360.00] They will bill as per our liking,
[362.32] they will take their cost and
we will take our share.
[367.04] Boss,
[368.12] I won’t be able to
support you this time.
[370.80] I am scared.
[374.92] You are saying no to me?
[377.32] I think you are bored of your job.
[379.68] The way, madam Arooj is
revealing our cheating,
[385.20] she will also strip us some day.
[388.28] Boss, I will lose the job,
then respect too.
[393.88] You think she found
a proof against us?
[401.44] If this was true, then
[402.56] we would have been in a problem
a long time back.
[404.64] It is possible she knows,
and she is quiet.
[408.48] She is not that good.
[411.08] And after all, she is alone,
[412.60] she is weak.
[414.52] Not alone, boss.
[416.44] Now Ammad is there with her.
[420.12] Arrangements will be
made for him soon,
[421.60] you just tell me,
[423.44] do you want to earn money or
[426.24] will you cry like this?
[429.28] Boss, money is such that
[432.12] a person agrees to give
their life for it.
[435.24] I am with you, order me.
[441.16] Look at this file,
[442.36] then I will tell you what
we have to do.
[444.64] Fine, boss.
[445.28] Fine. Leave.
[483.12] I am not disappointed that
[486.28] you got angry with me.
[490.64] I am disappointed that
[493.16] you put such a cheap
allegation on me.
[501.24] And maybe I will remember
this all my life.
[517.28] But you know Salman,
[520.60] a thought like this cannot
come in your mind.
[526.20] You are a good friend of mine,
well-wisher.
[531.68] That well-wisher, who has
[535.32] the cure for everything.
[544.68] How did you say this?
[565.92] Excuse me, sir.
[566.92] I wanted your signatures on this file.
[574.84] Excuse me, sir.
[575.88] Get lost!
[580.28] I had said no one will disturb me.
[583.40] Go from here.
[638.84] Arooj, you are wasting your
time beating about the bush.
[641.48] I am not beating about the bush,
[643.72] I am talking about you and me.
[645.88] I am saying
[647.40] what I have learned in this one year
old relationship of ours.
[654.16] Okay, fine, then,
[656.68] why did you not answer the
question I asked you?
[660.08] What should I think?
[674.52] Arooj, child. You are here.
[677.56] Why are you not in the office?
[678.80] Everyone must be waiting for you.
[682.40] I am coming from there.
[684.36] Then why are you standing here?
[686.76] Then where do I go, aunt?
[694.36] Child, Salman is like that.
[699.16] A little emotional and a little stupid.
[705.60] He is not stupid at all.
[709.44] Fine, I agree he is not stupid,
[713.68] but he is an idiot, you will
agree to this, right?
[716.24] What do you think?
[720.76] Now you are trying to make me laugh.
[722.96] Yes, child.
[724.00] So what is the harm in laughing,
huh?
[733.40] I know what happened last night.
[742.88] Salman’s behaviour and attitude,
hurt you, right?
[748.32] But child,
[750.48] this is Salman’s way
of showing his love.
[758.00] So Salman should show his love,
[761.20] why is he scaring me?
[763.16] Now you found out he is like this.
[767.16] Stubborn and short tempered.
[771.64] But child, he really loves you.
[776.24] I am sure.
[779.28] Come on,
[780.44] now fix your mood.
[784.44] Tell me, what will you drink?
[786.72] Tea? Coffee? Or orange juice?
[791.64] I will have anything.
[815.24] Look Salman, thinking and worrying like
this will not sort this matter.
[819.72] Come home and finish
this drama of the office,
[822.32] all the issues will be sorted.
[825.36] No, uncle.
[828.96] Arooj is doing all this
out of her interest.
[832.12] You will continue to fulfill
someone’s interest?
[834.80] What does business have to do
with someone’s interest?
[838.52] If you cannot close down the
office at home, then at least,
[841.64] fire that Ammad, who is
the root to this issue.
[851.72] Rest, is up to you, child.
[884.24] I think Salman realized his mistake.
[889.00] He is calling to say sorry.
[894.68] Hello.
[896.08] Hello. How are you?
[900.44] I am fine.
[909.80] If you want to say sorry,
then go ahead.
[912.00] I am waiting.
[914.64] I will say sorry when
I think I am wrong
[920.96] If you want to prove me wrong,
[924.72] then fire Ammad from this job.
[932.12] You said what you wanted to.
[934.12] You did what you wanted.
[940.64] Now hear what I am saying.
[945.28] Ammad will not go anywhere from here.
[954.64] Okay?
[1011.48] Sir actually, this land is costing us a lot.
[1014.32] I think we shouldn’t work
on this land further,
[1016.72] the land is really rocky.
[1023.48] Meaning, we will have to spend
a lot of money to make the base.
[1028.32] Absolutely sir.
[1029.28] I think we should quit this project.
[1036.28] Valid point.
[1038.36] Salman. Salman.
[1040.96] Huh?
[1042.72] What is your opinion on this?
[1046.96] What opinion?
[1053.80] I am really sorry guys,
[1055.56] we will talk about this later.
[1057.28] Meeting over.
[1064.40] What happened to Mr. Salman?
[1066.96] Nothing.
[1068.68] You keep this file in my room,
[1070.64] I will check it again.
[1073.00] Right sir.
[1074.28] and we cannot trust the soil testing.
[1078.76] We will do the testing again
[1080.00] and decide after that.
[1081.96] In fact, you give this file to Nawaz.
[1084.04] Nawaz, come to my room.
[1142.56] You said what you wanted to.
[1144.52] You did what you wanted.
[1147.92] Now hear what I am saying.
[1152.48] Ammad will not go
anywhere from here.
[1182.16] Arooj is the one who pushed
me towards doubt.
[1190.84] I didn’t believe what anyone said
[1198.72] because I trust Arooj the most.
[1205.68] But she took a stand for
Ammad in front of me?
[1211.40] When trust breaks,
doubts are born
[1214.88] and when the doubts
become strong,
[1217.84] everything breaks.
[1234.76] I know what happened last night.
[1242.40] Salman’s behaviour and
attitude, hurt you, right?
[1247.80] But child,
[1249.88] this is Salman’s way
of showing his love.
[1276.00] If you want to say sorry,
then go ahead.
[1278.16] I am waiting.
[1284.92] I will say sorry when
I think I am wrong
[1290.52] If you want to prove me wrong,
[1294.32] then fire Ammad from this job.
[1320.80] Little madam.
[1325.80] Yes, Wasai?
[1328.84] Are you crying?
[1336.40] When you cannot control
anyone, then
[1340.36] you cannot control yourself either.
[1343.00] But what will crying
do little madam?
[1349.00] I know.
[1355.08] But at least the burden on
the heart will reduce.
[1363.64] Why did you come?
Do you want something?
[1366.20] Madam Shanzay is here.
[1368.92] I have seated her in the lounge.
[1374.32] You tell her I am coming.
[1376.24] Sure.
[1452.96] It is all a lie.
[1461.92] This love, this loyalty,
[1466.92] it is all a lie.
[1470.88] You are a liar, Arooj.
[1475.24] Your love, your loyalty,
[1481.88] is all just for show.
[1487.28] You are a liar, Arooj.
[1489.88] You are a liar!
[1493.52] You are a liar.
[1634.20] How are you Shanzay?
[1635.20] I am fine, how are you?
[1636.44] I am fine. Have a seat.
[1639.68] What is the matter?
[1641.36] Your eyes don’t support
your words.
[1647.08] Maybe fate is not supporting
me nowadays.
[1652.64] What happened Arooj? All okay?
[1658.04] Shanzay,
[1663.16] when does doubt make
a place in the heart?
[1667.12] When love is intense.
[1669.80] Meaning?
[1673.24] Meaning,
[1674.76] when you have intense love,
[1676.96] then you also have intense doubt.
[1689.28] But why are you asking me all this?
[1694.60] Because the wall of doubts has
come between Salman and I.
[1701.28] Why? What happened?
[1707.44] Salman wants that I fire Ammad.
[1710.92] Salman is the CEO of this company,
[1713.44] he must have some logic…
[1715.04] He has no logic, he has a reason.
[1718.28] What reason?
[1732.16] He feels that I am frank with Ammad.
[1737.52] If all this is happening
cause of this Ammad,
[1743.04] then you throw him out.
[1744.92] What is there to worry about in this?
[1747.12] It is not about firing him, Shanzay.
[1752.68] It is a question on my character.
[1754.88] Then answer this question my love,
[1757.12] fire him.
[1762.72] Salman should be more
important for you,
[1764.96] instead of Ammad.
[1771.28] Fine. You are absolutely right.
[1778.36] You come with me,
[1780.96] and then you decide
[1783.08] that should I fire Ammad from the job
because of a small doubt or not?
[1794.08] Come on.
[1808.12] Have a seat.
[1813.16] I will call Ammad.
[1823.76] I think he is not on his seat.
[1828.56] Let me call on his mobile.
[1846.28] Hello.
[1847.28] Hello. Where are you?
[1850.44] I am in the accounts department.
[1852.52] Okay, come to my room immediately.
[1855.00] Okay, I will come.
[1858.00] You do one thing,
[1858.96] take out the six month statement,
[1860.80] I will check it when I come.
[1866.84] He is coming.
[1869.44] Okay listen,
[1871.28] don’t mention Salman
in front of Ammad,
[1874.24] please. Or else we will
have a big issue.
[1877.72] Fine.
[1879.64] Hello Shanzay, how are you?
[1881.52] Ammad, you? What a surprise.
[1886.20] I thought I would surprise you two.
[1891.40] Really amazing, surprise.
[1894.12] Have a seat.
[1895.72] Thank you.
[1898.40] By the way,
[1900.04] I was completely sure you would
come here searching for me.
[1905.20] You have not gotten out
of the habit of flirting.
[1908.12] Get serious.
[1909.60] With you?
[1911.84] Go wash your face.
[1913.48] I am not going through such
bad times right now.
[1919.44] You know Shanzay,
[1922.48] Ammad is an expert in his work.
[1924.92] He handles the finance for
this entire department.
[1930.24] Yes, he is an expert
in everything.
[1938.76] By the way, Ammad,
[1939.96] I am really happy to
see you here today.
[1942.40] Yes, by the way,
[1944.04] even I am really happy seeing
you here after so long.
[1948.00] Did you get married?
[1951.24] No Ammad,
[1952.28] you know my mama is so unwell,
[1955.60] how can I get married?
[1957.08] I have to take care of her.
[1963.04] Yes, you know both our
lives are similar.
[1971.16] My mama too is a cancer
patient and…
[1979.08] Okay tell me, will you
have tea or coffee?
[1981.08] What would you have?
[1982.56] I will have tea.
[2022.16] Arooj, Ammad has not changed at all.
[2026.88] He is the same. Full of life.
[2031.12] Yes,
[2032.28] now you saw it with your own eyes,
[2034.72] you must believe me now.
[2038.92] Yes, but,
[2042.36] Arooj only you and I know this,
[2044.96] not brother Salman.
[2048.92] Then what do I do?
[2051.88] Look,
[2053.20] firstly, you will have to remove 
this misunderstanding of brother Salman.
[2060.88] Because your relation with 
brother Salman is not like that
[2064.24] you don’t give importance 
to this issue.
[2067.24] Really? Fine.
[2071.08] I will fire Ammad. Then?
[2075.56] Then will I be able to remove
 my doubts from Salman’s heart?
[2079.88] Brother Salman doesn’t 
have a doubt,
[2082.04] he has a misunderstanding
[2086.84] and it is better to remove 
that misunderstanding soon.
[2090.52] Because you take this seriously.
[2092.76] Then you tell me, what do I do?
[2098.64] You go and talk about all 
this with brother Salman,
[2101.40] so that this problem gets solved.
[2105.56] To talk to Salman,
[2108.84] I will have to say sorry to him.
[2111.32] Then say it.
[2115.56] Shanzay,
[2117.56] here we are talking about 
my character.
[2120.20] How do I say sorry?
[2122.12] In fact, he should say sorry to me.
[2125.56] Arooj, here you are upset, 
there brother Salman.
[2130.76] One of you will have to remove
 this misunderstanding,
[2133.72] then you do it.
[2135.48] If I have to prove my character 
to remove this misunderstanding,
[2139.88] then I don’t find this right at all.
[2142.44] He should trust me this 
much that I am only his.
[2147.64] All the things that you 
are saying to me,
[2150.36] go and say this to brother Salman.
[2153.88] I think he should know 
all this himself.
[2158.88] Look Arooj,
[2160.20] Ammad is just a friend of ours,
[2162.52] but your relation with brother 
Salman is more than that.
[2174.92] If I fire Ammad,
[2178.40] then this thing is proven that
[2180.68] there was really 
something between us.
[2197.92] Look Arooj,
[2201.08] I will not call the angle you 
are thinking with wrong.
[2207.64] Actually, Shanzay,
[2213.16] Salman has considered my love poor.
