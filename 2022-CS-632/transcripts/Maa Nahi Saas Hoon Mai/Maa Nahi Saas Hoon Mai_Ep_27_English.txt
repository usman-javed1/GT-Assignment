Master, my driver has visited 
you twice and come back, and you didn’t give the clothes. You had promised to give 
the clothes on Thursday. I will not make him visit 
again and again. Fine, I am sending 
Nawaz tomorrow, you send all my clothes. Madam, tea. Yes. Iron the clothes that 
are kept there. Sure, madam. Wasai. yes, madam? You take out the clothes 
from my suitcase and set them in the cupboard again. Yes, younger madam, as you order. Why child? Why are you unpacking 
all the clothes? I am not going. I said no to Salman. But why? Did you see sister-in-law, Shaista. Salman didn’t agree when
 I asked him, but he said no as soon 
as Arooj said. Wow Arooj, you did great. You made my son follow 
your orders. I have surely said no, aunty, but you are the reason for the order. When you have made fun 
of my order involving Salman, then it is better that the 
two of you go. Child, what did you do? What did I explain to you? You are really good, aunt. But I don’t want happiness 
that is loaned from someone. I had never imagined such 
a life, Salman. Arooj, trust me, it will all be okay. It is so torturous. What sort of a life is this? Is there not a single moment, where I can feel peace. It is really disappointing for me that 
you don’t find peace with me here. No Salman, I did not say that. I have no complaints from you. Only you are my own. You know, when I talk to you, I forget all my sorrows and worries. Don’t ever think that. Then have faith, mom too will become yours one day. I wish. But Salman, I am tired of the same daily life. I have nothing to do in my life. I can understand. I know you are suffering
 from mom’s injustice. But I have an idea. What idea? To remove the boredom from your life. What is that? Tell me. You have done your MBA 
in finance, right? Yes. Then why don’t you join the 
finance department in our office? Really? Yes, why not? Will this be possible? Why won’t it be possible? Fine, Salman, I will join the office and thank you so much. My pleasure. Yes, Mr. Ahmad, tell me. Yes, I had sent them the email…. Thank God, I finally some change in my life. I will go to the office. Why did I not give this 
good news to Shanzay? I will call her. Hello. Hello Shanzay. 
I have a good news. No, greetings, no salutations, 
directly the news? Hey, leave the formality, right now listen to me. I feel it is a really good news.
 Okay tell me. I am joining Salman’s 
office from tomorrow. Oh wow, that’s a great news. Yes, and that too as 
a finance director. Now I feel I will have to 
call madam Arooj, madam. Shut up. What is 
wrong with you? I used to get so bored at home, the same routine of daily life. Now at least, I have something to do in my life. Okay, that’s good, you have a family business and your participation will be 
beneficial for this business. Yes, and most importantly, I will also be saved from aunt 
Mehreen’s taunts all day long. You are right about that. This is Miss Hadia. She heads our project side. Greetings. Greetings. Come. Tell me, is Miss Arooj’s 
room ready? Yes, sir, for now we have arranged 
the room in front for madam. Alright. Come, 
let me show you. Sure. Sir, did you call? Arooj, meet him. He is Mr. Nawaz, our finance manager. Greetings madam. Greetings and Nawaz, meet my wife, Arooj Salman. The new director of our 
finance department. What? Yes, and after today, 
you will work under her. Sure, sir. Now do one thing, introduce her to the staff. Alright? Sir. Okay, that’s your room. Now it is between you 
and your staff. My work here is done. Thank you. Any other order for me. No. Fine, then I will join you. Okay? See you. Sir. Come madam. Madam if you need anything, then call Nawaz. Yes, sure Mr. Nawaz. Today is my first day in the office, so I don’t have an idea 
about things that much. But yes, I want to see the files of the 
ongoing, current projects. Why not? Sure. Great. So, send me the files for the 
projects in my office. I will see. Sure? Thank you. Listen. Yes, boss? Did you hear what madam said? Yes, boss. Go to the room with the files,
 I am coming. Yes, sir. What is this trouble? I will have to inform boss. Wasai. Wasai. Yes? Yes, elder madam. Where is Arooj? I don’t see her. Is she still sleeping? Little madam is not in her room. She went with little
 master to the office. She went to the office? But why did she go? What is going on in this home? Since Arooj has come to this home, everyone is doing what they want. No one can question that Arooj, what is going on? Why did she go to the
 office? What for? Elder madam, I don’t know this. Yes. How will you know when the owners of 
this home don’t know? Little master was saying that from today, from today,
 younger madam will go to the office with me daily. First, she took over Salman, then the home, now she is going to take 
over the business as well. Arooj, I will never let this happen. Boss, be a little alert. What happened, Nawaz? Boss, madam Arooj has taken over
 the charge for the director finance. Does this not seem 
like breaking news for you. What is breaking in this? 
I know. But you don’t know what I
 am going to tell you now. Madam Arooj, has asked for 
all the record of the finance. So? What is to worry in this? You are disturbing me for no reason. Sir, you don’t understand. Sir Salman trusted you blindly and you took advantage of it 
and did corruption of millions. All of it will be caught. You will become a criminal 
in the office and home. Fine, you go. I will think 
of something. Sure, boss. Now this girl will be 
with Salman all the time. When she will stay in
 the office all day long, she will control Salman’s mind. Then Salman will only 
see Arooj all around. What Arooj says will happen. And Salman will continue to agree. I will get lost in such a situation. No, no, this is not possible. I will have to come in the middle. What documents are you showing me? I had asked you to bring me 
the file for the last three months and you are showing me 
the past three years? Keep this with you. Bring the new file. Uncle, what are you looking at? I am seeing my daughter busy in work. But Arooj, why have you gotten yourself involved in this work, files, addition and subtraction? We have a line of managers. Uncle, I was bored sitting at home. Salman said come to the office. I said come on, and I came here. Salman surprises me. Why? What happened? This is not the right decision. I know you came here 
worried from Mehreen. That’s how mothers-in-law are, child. Why are mothers-in-law 
not like mothers? Because they can never 
become mothers. This is nothing recent, 
it has been there forever. In fact, there is an unspoken
 competition between mother and daughters-in-law 
in every country. Can I give you an advice? Yes. When Mehreen’s temperament 
gets fine, then there can be no better 
place for you than the home. You were not an 
escapist like this. No uncle, I have not
 escaped anything. First Salman wanted and secondly, 
I have a finance degree. I thought I am getting
 bored sitting at home, so why don’t I use
 my education well and all of you in the 
office get helped too. Fine, good luck. Thank you. Naseema. Hey, Naseema, where are you? Yes, coming. Greetings. You are back. Greetings. I think I have come. Wow, Master, you look really happy today. Here. Have sweets and feed me too. Sweets? What are these sweets for? Our Arooj has got a job. Job? Why a job? And she didn’t even tell me that she was searching for a job. Why does she need a job? I don’t know about her need, but I do know that what we taught her 
didn’t go to waste. What are you saying? I don’t understand. When she called me, even I didn’t understand anything. Then she told me that she has joined the family 
business with Salman. Then say that. Master, you say weird things. Our Arooj is the owner, what job? Yes, we can say that. But it is a job, and these sweets are there because this is the same office where our Arooj went for a job and rejected it herself. Today, she is the owner of that place. What happened? What are you thinking? Job, and Arooj? That too suddenly. I am just thinking why Arooj needs a job? What if… Why do you worry? God makes it all fine. I am going to get fresh, you serve these sweets, and make good tea. Then we will sit and 
celebrate well. I will. Arooj coming to the
 office like this, and getting involved 
in the system suddenly seems weird. I have always worked here 
considering it my company. Now if it is my company, so why should I care about two 
to four hundred thousand here and there? Now this girl will make it difficult. Anyway, experience 
is also something. Boss. Boss, what is the matter? You seem to be lost 
in deep thought. It feels like you are planning
 something new. You go from here right now, I have a bad headache anyway. I feel madam Arooj has 
given my boss a headache. Nawaz! Sorry, boss. Sorry. Master, come. Have tea. Give me tea. What is the matter, Naseema? Why do I see worry on your face,
 instead of happiness. You cannot understand 
a mother’s heart. These doubts of you mothers 
can never be removed that fathers don’t understand anything. Actually, the thing is 
my daughter is progressive, she has been born to 
move forward. And you tell me, Naseema, what is the point 
of the education that you burn in the kitchen. You are right. I feel satisfied hearing you talk, but why suddenly…. Master, there is something. Mothers always worry. Our daughter is the owner. It is possible that Salman wanted his wife to help him in business. It is such a small thing. But I don’t think this is
 only Salman’s wish. Then do one thing, invite both of them for dinner. You ask your questions, and I will meet my daughter. Will Salman come? You know he is really busy 
cause of his business. Okay, we will meet Arooj, that’s where our 
real happiness lies. Here, have sweets. Then fine, I will call Arooj. I will go get my mobile. Who asked you to go 
to the office, Arooj? I asked her. I am not talking to you Salman. Arooj, you tell me. I went to the office on
 Salman’s instructions. I understand this cunningness 
of yours well. You know I can never ignore anything
 Salman says, so you always try to 
hide behind him. I am Salman’s wife, 
so I will hide behind him. Secondly, I joined the office because I have done 
my masters in finance. Several girls do that. Yes, but all of them 
are not my wives. I understand. I understand well that my son
 is getting out of my hands. So, you loosen your grip. It is possible that Salman 
won’t slip out of your hands. Idrees, what is the matter? You look worried? Do you think I am worried? I have spent my life with you, but I have not seen you worried 
like this ever before. There is some issue at the office. That’s it? If it is an office issue, then tell Salman, he will solve it. He created the issue. What is the issue? I have not seen you this 
serious before today. He brought Arooj to 
the office suddenly. Hey, so what is there 
to worry in this? It is good that poor 
thing got freed or else she is under 
Mehreen’s pressure at home. This is not the solution 
to handle Mehreen, there can be other ways too. Why do you have an issue? Arooj going to the office will also help Salman. This is not considered good
 in the business community. After all, I am not 
in favour of women at home going to the
 office and working. You have something 
really narrowminded. You were never this conservative. Shaista, you won’t get it. Then make me understand. Leave it. What happened Mehreen? Is all okay? Nothing is okay, 
sister-in-law Shaista. How are you seeing 
all this happen and you are not 
saying anything? I don’t understand, what am I seeing and what am I not saying? Do you not see? Arooj has started 
going to the office. How can you tolerate 
something so wrong? If it is wrong, then I will say it. Okay, so you don’t find 
all of this wrong that the women of the home 
are taking care of the business. I didn’t do anything like 
this with Waqar. You couldn’t do it either. You are comparing 
me to that Arooj? You are the one doing the 
comparison, Mehreen. What do you want? I want that Arooj doesn’t 
go to the office. She says all sort of 
things to my Salman. I take care of her here. But in the office? Who will keep an eye 
on her in the office? He doesn’t understand me. Arooj. What is the matter? What are you thinking? I am thinking about aunty’s 
behaviour last night. I am surprised how she thinks of everything
 so negatively? Arooj, don’t misbehave about mom. What misbehaviour? I just said I am surprised. Yes, but this is misbehaviour. What do you think? Just because I have started 
to hear everything you say, then you can misbehave with mom, and I will not say anything? Sorry, this will not happen. You are taking it wrong, I said nothing like that. Look Arooj, I took you out of the home and
 brought you to the office. What do you want now? Should I drop you off
at your parents’ home. Meaning? Look, it is clear, you cannot live with mom, but I am incomplete without her. Now you tell me yourself, what do I do? Have you ever listened to me earlier, that you will listen to me now? Leave it. Fine, we will leave it. But remember one thing, we have to live with mom. I shouldn’t hear this in future. and I have never denied this. I just want to spend 
a good life with you. That’s it. Mehreen’s questions have
 given me a headache. Still, she is not satisfied 
with even a single answer. Madam, I agree that younger madam 
is really educated. But still, doing the work at the 
office is really difficult. Arooj has a degree. I have full faith in her, she can do all the work
 at the office well. If little madam can handle 
the work at the office so well, then why is elder madam 
so worried? Wasai, don’t you know? Mehreen must be fearing that Arooj will spend all day
 with Salman in the office, now who will she shoot
 her arrows on? You are also right, madam. Mehreen is worried that Arooj will spend so 
much time with Salman, what if she controls Salman? No madam, all this is about fate. If staying with someone 
did something, then I wouldn’t be going 
around aimlessly like this. Okay Wasai, go and 
make coffee for me. Sure. Mr. Nawaz, come to my room.
