[20.92] I don’t know understand that
[22.76] even someone as educated as 
brother Salman can do this?
[29.84] No Shanzay,
[38.44] I don’t think Salman responsible 
in all this.
[44.20] What?
[45.64] What are you saying?
[52.08] Brother Salman treated you this way
[54.88] and you don’t even think 
he is responsible?
[58.76] I got tired of what aunt Mehreen 
was saying
[62.32] and I shouted at Salman in my anger.
[65.88] So what does this mean?
[67.20] He will drag you out of the home on this?
[73.96] Stop it Arooj.
[75.68] Don’t take brother Salman’s side.
[81.04] If you look at it,
[83.88] then I too wasn’t answering anything 
he was answering.
[91.84] I was staying distanced from him,
[95.96] so what could he do?
[102.96] If I stay quiet, I am ruined, if I speak, 
I am in turmoil.
[107.12] What do I do?
[109.96] Meaning, if you don’t say anything, then 
he would drag you out of the home.
[113.56] If you had spoken up, then maybe you 
would have found a solution for this problem.
[117.76] Shanzay, you know,
[121.08] my parents are already missing.
[128.04] In future everyone will point fingers 
on my identification,
[131.36] that who am I? How will I 
answer everyone?
[133.84] What will I say?
[135.84] Arooj, you do one thing,
[138.84] you go to your mother, 
aunt Naseema’s home.
[150.84] No.
[155.20] She too is not my own either.
[160.08] What will I do going to her.
[165.24] Now I feel that maybe
[169.16] I have no one in this world.
[172.20] So you will become a mental patient 
thinking like this.
[175.44] We will have to find a solution for this.
[191.16] I feel that maybe
[194.48] I am becoming a burden on you.
[200.84] No problem, I will leave.
[205.04] Arooj, wait. What are you saying?
[207.88] This is also your home. 
You can come here when you want.
[210.68] I can never object on this.
[214.12] Okay, sit. Sit.
[218.32] We will talk on this topic 
in the morning.
[220.68] You rest right now.
[223.16] Go and sleep.
[228.92] I want to stay here for a while.
[235.76] Okay, don’t worry further, okay?
[238.92] Don’t think too much. Rest.
[242.36] Do you want something? 
Should I bring it?
[350.28] Because your behavior is extraordinary,
[353.00] you have not done anything like 
this today. Don’t I know you?
[355.44] So what do you know? 
You know nothing.
[361.04] This means there is something 
that I don’t know.
[367.28] If you find out something, 
then tell me too.
[372.12] I am searching for that,
[374.28] because I am at the greatest loss.
[377.16] How is that?
[379.64] My Arooj got lost in this crowd
 of questions.
[408.52] Leave me. Leave me.
[411.16] Leave…
Get out of here.
[419.12] and don’t try to come back 
to this home again.
[520.92] You are still awake?
[523.32] You haven’t slept?
[527.56] I am worried cause of your worry.
[536.16] I have lost my sleep.
[540.44] But I have no worry.
[544.44] I am fine.
[548.68] You two are fine,
[551.48] but have you thought about Arooj?
[553.40] Where would she be?
[560.40] Arooj is not a child, sister in law Shaista.
[566.48] Wherever she went, she must have 
gone after thinking.
[569.08] This is what you think.
[570.68] The daughter of the child is 
out of the home,
[572.80] we too have a responsibility, right?
[583.28] What responsibility?
[584.88] That we go find her, 
we find out where she is.
[590.40] If you are so worried about her, 
then call her.
[594.64] I called, her phone is off.
[604.92] I don’t know where all will she be 
telling her sad story and defaming me.
[611.96] You should have thought of this
[616.36] when you held her hand and 
dragged her out of this home.
[619.96] I don’t know where that 
helpless child would be.
[622.20] What condition would she be in?
[626.64] Aren’t you sympathizing 
a lot with Arooj?
[633.28] I also sympathize with you.
[639.64] You never use your mind,
[642.48] nor do you think with your mind.
[671.16] Sister in law, Shaista.
[676.68] Salman is a sensible boy,
[679.52] he can think of what is good and 
bad for him better than you.
[682.08] So, please,
[683.60] don’t dictate him like this.
[728.84] What are you looking at standing 
for so long?
[742.44] I am seeing that
[747.20] this is such a big city.
[751.16] There are so many homes here.
[755.60] There are porches in the homes.
[762.32] My papa would also have 
a porch like this.
[772.28] Arooj, you will see,
[777.00] you will surely find your real parents 
one day.
[781.52] I pray for this with my heart.
[835.84] Will you be quiet.
[838.52] This is the limit.
[840.32] Your court never ends.
[847.60] You always have a session of 
questions and answers all the time.
[850.88] What do you think of yourself?
[855.28] I don’t find it necessary to answer
 any question of yours.
[859.68] You will remain completely 
quiet now!
[869.08] I say, leave me.
[871.12] Where are you taking me? 
Leave me.
[872.92] Salman, what are you doing?
Enough!
[876.40] No one will stop me.
[881.80] And no one dare come after me.
[885.16] Leave me. 
Leave me.
[899.96] I had a misunderstanding 
for no reason,
[909.80] that my Salman has been
 distanced from me.
[918.84] Arooj has him under her control.
[928.72] But the way, Salman,
[939.28] dragged Arooj out of the home 
for my sake,
[952.60] for the sake of his mother,
[961.84] he increased his mother’s trust
[968.44] and that Arooj’s misunderstanding
also got removed.
[1024.60] What are you thinking, Arooj?
[1029.36] Earlier, when I used to 
go to my parents’ home,
[1031.60] I used to be really happy.
[1034.60] I would have a peace,
[1038.72] that I have a haven.
[1042.96] That’s how it is even now.
[1047.28] Today, I feel like
[1050.92] a corner of that haven has moved
[1055.64] and bright sunlight is entering 
from the other side.
[1152.20] The whole night has passed,
[1162.16] where has this Arooj gone?
[1170.16] Her confidence tells me 
she surely has a place to go.
[1178.52] She surely has a well-wisher.
[1185.04] I will also find out about this.
[1191.84] And whatever she is hiding from me,
[1196.24] I will find out everything.
[1202.68] You know this is the limit.
[1208.96] She didn’t break her silence.
[1215.04] Even if the relation breaks.
[1344.36] yes, son, Salman. How are you?
[1347.84] I am fine.
[1349.80] Let me talk to Arooj.
[1351.84] Arooj?
[1353.08] Arooj is not here.
[1356.56] What do you mean she is not there?
[1359.00] She left at night.
[1360.44] What did you say?
[1361.84] She left home at night?
[1369.76] She is not even here, 
so where did she go?
[1374.48] She would know this.
[1416.04] Nothing is left now.
[1425.20] Nothing is left that I can even 
spend a day with Arooj.
[1437.04] Arooj made the decision
[1447.04] I was supposed to make.
[1488.12] My heart is sinking.
[1492.32] Arooj has left home since last night.
[1496.84] The whole night has passed
[1502.44] and Salman called just now.
[1505.64] Something is wrong.
[1510.56] I was even telling you last night
[1512.64] that my heart is worried.
[1514.96] I don’t know where my daughter 
would be.
[1517.44] You continue to call her.
[1532.80] Where are you coming from, child?
[1541.36] What happened Arooj?
[1543.56] Tell us something.
[1551.52] Okay come. Come, have a seat.
[1586.40] Salman was worried,
[1589.16] he called.
[1592.16] When did he call?
[1593.76] A little while back.
[1598.36] He was worried?
[1606.16] He thought of me really soon.
[1614.64] Tell us something, 
what has happened?
[1619.64] Papa,
[1624.08] you will not call Salman now.
[1628.16] He doesn’t care about me at all.
[1661.40] Arooj
[1678.04] I knew it.
[1688.24] I knew that she wouldn’t have gone 
to her parents home.
[1692.52] Really?
[1694.36] What did they say?
[1697.20] They said that the whole night passed,
but she didn’t go to their home.
[1700.52] Yes, so it is possible she got 
stuck in a trouble,
[1703.24] anything can happen.
[1705.84] Nothing must have happened to her,
[1707.84] she would have gone to the place
of her liking.
[1711.00] Salman, you call Shanzay.
[1713.16] Please, call Shanzay, immediately.
[1738.84] Her number is not connecting.
[1741.40] She is her friend,
[1742.84] she must have surely told her 
not to attend the phone.
[1756.28] Mehreen, please be quiet.
[1762.56] You say whatever comes to your heart.
[1764.96] My heart is burning sister in law, 
Shaista,
[1767.08] my son is worried.
[1773.24] This girl has not given us anything 
other than worries.
[1781.88] Aunt, you tell me yourself.
[1786.32] If I had gotten angry,
[1788.28] then should she have done all this.
[1789.96] Yes, what else?
[1791.40] She should have knocked on the door
after two minutes.
[1794.76] But how could she do that?
[1796.24] She had to blow this 
out of proportions.
[1809.80] But not anymore.
[1817.48] That girl is not worth keeping
 in this home.
[1820.16] Salman, please. 
Don’t be emotional.
[1824.00] Anything can happen to her,
worry for her.
[1827.84] I am being emotional?
[1829.44] And what about what she did?
[1853.24] Hello.
[1854.52] Yes, hello, son, Salman.
[1856.44] Son, I had to tell you that 
Arooj has come here right now.
[1863.44] I am coming.
[1865.40] Fine.
[1868.28] Who was on the phone? 
What did they say?
[1870.32] Who was on the phone? 
Salman.
[1886.80] Wasai, bring tea for me.
[1890.64] Sure.
[1948.32] Arooj, say something. 
What happened?
[1953.20] Papa,
[1955.68] you will not call Salman now.
[1959.76] He doesn’t care about me at all.
[2035.00] Why did you come and sit here?
[2041.36] Naseema,
[2043.88] the way Arooj has come.
[2047.40] I feel that she didn’t come 
by her will.
[2052.36] Arooj’s silence makes me feel
[2056.52] that there is surely something.
[2060.40] She will tell us herself,
[2062.60] you don’t ask her a lot of questions.
[2067.64] Since she has found out about her,
[2071.48] she is going through a lot 
of mental torture.
[2075.40] She even seems upset with Salman.
[2079.00] She came without informing.
[2081.52] Even Salman doesn’t know.
[2090.08] Okay, you come inside.
[2093.04] You don’t get unwell. Come.
[2096.32] God will be kind, Naseema.
[2099.56] Come on. 
Come.
[2124.96] What has that Arooj made me?
[2132.52] I changed myself so much for Arooj.
[2140.88] But Arooj doesn’t realize this.
[2149.28] Mom think that I am changed.
[2157.00] She says I am not the Salman 
from before.
[2169.08] I don’t even remember,
 who and what I am.
[2179.16] Arooj doesn’t fear the breaking 
of this relation.
[2187.16] But she doesn’t want to 
break her silence.
