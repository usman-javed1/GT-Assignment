[20.72] I understand the meaning of your 
phone call.
[25.52] Meaning, the comfort with which you have
 explained the entire scenario to me,
[31.96] that Arooj can get the test done again,
[35.16] then what can happen, 
what cannot happen,
[38.40] I understood it all.
[40.88] Right now, you send Arooj from there,
[48.52] I will take care of the rest.
[51.84] Alright.
[77.92] This doctor is really clever,
[82.28] but this Arooj isn’t any less clever.
[86.28] She reached there secretly.
[109.04] Sorry,
[110.68] I got a little busy
[112.16] and you people also came without
an appointment.
[116.32] Yes, doctor.
[118.64] So, I was saying that you people 
don’t believe our reports.
[123.96] You don’t understand,
[126.28] look, it is also necessary for us
to be satisfied.
[131.40] You know the credibility of our hospital.
[135.12] No one in the entire country has 
such advance machinery,
[138.48] and these reports have been given 
to you after testing.
[142.60] Okay fine, I agree that 
these reports are fine,
[145.32] and I am also really satisfied hearing 
what you said,
[151.52] but,
[153.88] there must be a treatment for all this.
[156.28] Look, you get satisfied first.
[158.08] Get the test done from wherever you want,
[167.64] and as far as the treatment is concerned,
 we will take care of it later.
[171.64] And leave this report with me,
[173.80] my assistant will call you.
[176.24] But, we are professionals.
[181.32] Thank you.
[183.28] Let’s go, mama.
[216.56] Aunty Mehreen.
[217.80] You are here? All okay?
[222.44] I am so sorry,
[224.48] I didn’t take your permission and 
I came to your room.
[227.44] It’s okay. Have a seat.
[230.72] You know, you don’t need permission.
[233.68] Actually,
[235.44] I wanted to talk about Salman.
[238.48] I couldn’t resist, so I came 
to your room to talk.
[242.60] Yes, tell me.
[243.88] What do you want to talk about Salman?
[248.88] Aunty Mehreen,
[250.80] since Arooj’s medical reports came,
[254.24] I see you more worried than her.
[258.04] I mean, these are her reports, 
it is her issue,
[260.56] she should be worried, right?
[263.44] I am worried for my Salman.
[266.76] My Salman’s wife is not capable 
of becoming a mother.
[271.60] This way, my Salman’s life will be ruined.
[274.44] Exactly,
[276.96] and there will be thousands of girls like 
Arooj in the world who cannot be a mother.
[282.72] There must be,
[284.80] but Salman is my only son.
[287.40] I want to fill my son’s life
with all the happiness.
[291.84] Obviously, aunty. I know this.
[295.76] I know you are his well-wisher
and he is yours.
[302.72] But if Arooj cannot become a mother, 
so what?
[310.48] I mean, you can become a grandmother,
[312.84] Salman can be a father.
[316.52] Look, Salman is still young,
[319.80] he earns well, he is educated.
[323.12] What does he lack?
[327.12] After all…
[330.48] after all, Arooj is not the last woman
in this world.
[373.40] It is good that you got your checkup done
 by that doctor yourself
[376.36] or what is the issue that 
cannot be resolved.
[380.56] Yes, I did visit the doctor.
[384.36] But everything is the same,
[387.72] as I have told you.
[390.72] Look Arooj, that was the expertise 
of that doctor,
[393.36] and I would say that a person should 
satisfy their heart.
[403.24] Because this is an issue for life.
[406.48] Yes,
[409.12] we have an issue now.
[411.60] Okay, you don’t worry.
[413.44] My mama’s friend is a gynaecologist.
[416.36] I will talk to her to take time for you.
[418.44] We should also take a second opinion.
[426.12] Thank you.
[427.88] No need to thank me.
[429.48] You just don’t worry now. 
I am going now.
[432.20] I will call you and tell you as soon as 
I get an appointment, okay?
[436.32] You won’t get worried, right?
[438.24] Okay. Bye. 
Bye.
[487.00] Wasai.
[488.72] Hey, little madam, you.
[491.32] Do you want something?
[493.96] I want to have coffee.
[495.36] Yes, yes, why not?
[497.44] You go to your room. 
I will bring it for you.
[503.00] By the way,
[506.84] this friend of yours…
what is her name?
[511.28] Shanzay.
[514.08] Does she come here often?
[521.60] I am she seemed like 
your well-wisher.
[527.40] Friends are always well-wishers.
[529.96] Yes,
[531.64] you are right about that.
[538.16] I have heard everything 
you two talked about.
[552.00] It is called bad manners listening 
to someone talk secretly.
[557.08] It must be.
[563.32] You know, you are really weird people.
[566.48] Where you should show manners, 
you don’t show it
[569.68] and where you don’t need to 
show manners, there…
[574.24] In fact, one minute,
[577.84] it is also part of your manners 
and traditions
[584.16] that the woman who doesn’t 
have a child,
[587.88] you divorce her and send her away 
from the home, right?
[612.44] For your kind information,
[615.72] you don’t divorce the one 
who doesn’t have a child.
[639.16] Is your madam Arooj, right?
[652.00] Here, I see everyone crazy 
for madam Arooj.
[676.64] Mom, I don’t understand 
what you are saying.
[679.76] Salman, you know well 
what I am talking about.
[684.56] Why do you always act unaware 
on this topic?
[686.84] Mama, will you clarify and tell me,
what topic are you talking about?
[693.28] I am talking about Arooj not being 
able to be a mother.
[699.08] I want your child at all cost.
[702.64] Mom, why do you worry?
[705.36] Very soon, I will give you a good news.
[709.56] Really?
[711.12] How is that?
[717.00] The opinion of the doctors is not 
hidden from anyone.
[727.08] Mom, I have made a decision.
[734.92] I will adopt a child.
[739.00] What?
[740.76] We will bring up someone else’s child?
[744.04] Salman, that is really weird.
[751.56] I am literally surprised aunty. 
I am surprised right now.
[757.76] I am surprised at Salman’s thinking.
[761.52] Why would you bring up 
someone else’s child?
[765.16] Mom, what are you saying?
[768.88] When we will bring up that child, 
they will be our child.
[773.68] After all, there is a small legal process,
[776.00] after that me and Arooj will be 
their legal parents.
[781.00] Hear me out clearly Salman,
[784.44] this will not happen while I am alive.
[787.36] We will not bring up an adopted child.
[789.92] I just want my Salman’s child.
[806.76] Impossible. This boy has gone mad.
[809.88] We will bring up someone else’s child.
[811.68] My only son is saying that we will 
bring up someone else’s child.
[816.48] Aunty, you please relax, 
we will talk to him.
[821.04] He only follows Arooj’s advice.
[848.04] You know, you are really weird people.
[851.20] Where you should show manners,
 you don’t show it
[854.36] and where you don’t need 
to show manners, there…
[858.84] In fact, one minute,
[862.52] it is also part of your manners 
and traditions
[868.88] that the woman 
who doesn’t have a child,
[872.60] you divorce her and send her away
 from the home, right?
[908.24] Arooj.
[913.64] What are you thinking?
[923.08] I am thinking that I am so unlucky.
[928.32] You are not unlucky.
[935.40] I cannot be a mother.
[944.96] And you are saying I am not unlucky?
[950.12] Arooj, I don’t consider this as bad luck.
[957.56] And please, you don’t think about this.
[964.92] You don’t think anything, Salman,
[969.92] but people think.
[978.92] Or maybe, they will also make a decision.
[984.96] Who are those people? 
What are they thinking?
[992.68] I don’t know.
[1004.00] Arooj,
[1005.72] trust me.
[1010.24] No one can make any decision 
against my will, with me here.
[1015.44] And it doesn’t matter to me 
what anyone is thinking
[1017.96] and what they are not thinking.
[1071.84] Did you call me?
[1073.64] Yes,
[1075.16] have a seat.
[1076.12] I want to talk to you about 
something important.
[1080.40] I am sure it is about Salman.
[1084.24] How did you get an idea for this?
[1088.44] Because I know,
[1090.24] no one else in your life more 
important than Salman.
[1097.60] But maybe Salman is forgetting this.
[1103.60] Hmmm.
[1106.80] It is possible.
[1109.56] Why?
[1111.76] You don’t believe it?
[1116.68] I believe it.
[1120.80] I know you cannot be wrong.
[1130.40] But aunty,
[1134.72] I don’t like interfering in Salman and 
Arooj’s personal matter like this.
[1146.84] But now that you have called me,
[1150.40] so whatever you say.
[1154.52] Alizay,
[1156.60] you are a good girl.
[1162.12] You too are really good.
[1165.16] In fact, you are just like 
Salman told me about you.
[1172.04] Okay,
[1173.12] what did you want? 
You had called me.
[1177.40] Actually, Alizay,
[1180.40] I cannot tolerate it at all that
[1184.04] Salman brings up someone else’s child.
[1193.28] Yes,
[1195.60] you should strictly say no to him, then.
[1203.88] So that he cannot ignore what you say.
[1208.40] After all,
[1210.92] someone else’s child is a stranger.
[1217.24] I don’t know what is wrong with him?
[1218.76] Why is he making such weird 
experiences with his life?
[1222.56] What has happened?
[1230.24] You talk to him.
[1317.32] Why are you worried?
[1319.40] I am seeing that you are worried 
since Arooj came and went.
[1325.96] Master,
[1329.76] the sorrow of not bearing a child 
is life taking.
[1337.00] It eats up a person on the inside.
[1345.88] Do you remember
[1348.64] the difficult days we have been through?
[1355.24] Homes get ruined.
[1361.36] But this didn’t happen between us.
[1366.20] Why did you think of this?
[1369.56] I too have gone through the sorrow
of not having a child,
[1374.84] and now
[1377.68] it has come in my daughter’s share.
[1383.36] Oh my God.
[1386.56] Arooj came to tell you this.
[1390.20] Yes.
[1396.16] I took her to the hospital.
[1400.60] The doctor says
[1404.28] the report that we have received
is the truth.
[1415.40] Okay, you don’t cry.
[1418.60] God will make it better.
[1421.40] I am crying
[1424.76] because we had Arooj later.
[1431.32] You have always supported me.
[1435.68] I had no mother-in-law,
[1438.92] but Arooj has a mother-in-law,
[1442.00] and you know well what sort of 
a mother-in-law she is.
[1489.92] Aunty Mehreen was already 
against Arooj,
[1495.92] what was undone, that has been 
done by my planning.
[1500.88] Now I have shown aunty the way,
[1503.80] we will see
[1507.60] if she reaches where I want her
to reach or not?
[1513.92] And there is no chance of not 
reaching there.
[1518.36] I have brought the destinations 
closer to her myself.
[1537.20] Madam, sir is coming.
[1540.20] Hmmm.
[1547.56] Yes, mama, you had called me. 
All okay?
[1551.16] I will tell you.
[1559.12] Salman,
[1561.64] I have made this decision 
after thinking hard.
[1565.64] Whatever you are thinking cannot 
happen at any cost.
[1573.92] Why can it not happen? 
You know…
[1576.56] I just called you here to listen to me, 
and not to speak.
[1593.28] What happened, Mehreen?
[1598.28] What does Salman want that 
you cannot do?
[1602.48] What is the need to adopt a child,
[1604.92] what is the problem?
[1614.48] The problem is in Arooj, not you.
[1624.16] That is why I have decided,
[1628.84] that you will get married again.
[1736.92] What is the need to adopt a child,
[1739.36] what is the problem?
[1743.36] The problem is in Arooj, not you.
[1752.72] That is why I have decided,
[1757.56] that you will get married again.
[1766.04] Does a woman not want to be 
a mother by choice?
[1772.40] Why do people who know the will of God
in everything forget
[1775.96] when they get to this point,
[1782.88] that this is my God’s will.
[1789.08] No woman has any fault in this.
[1795.64] Is not becoming a mother 
a crime of a woman?
[1801.36] And such a big crime,
[1803.80] that she is dragged out of the home?
[1809.00] This is my home too.
[1812.48] I didn’t come here to leave.
[1817.72] No one can drag me out of here.
[1822.92] Will Salman bring another woman on me?
[1830.56] No.
[1832.76] No, no, this is not possible.
[1839.64] Yes, yes, I have understood. 
I understand.
[1842.16] No, we will talk on this topic 
when I come.
[1845.24] Okay.
[1848.68] Do you see Mehreen
[1851.12] how she is taking advantage of 
our silence
[1854.32] and doing what she wants.
[1857.04] Shaista, today I will not ask you 
what you want to say,
[1859.60] because you are right.
[1862.64] If my thinking is correct,
[1865.00] then it should be implemented.
[1867.92] How will you implement it?
[1872.96] I will fight for Arooj.
[1875.32] I will talk to Salman.
[1878.76] No, Mehreen is there to make 
Salman understand.
[1882.96] But now I will make him understand.
[1887.00] Okay, even if you make Salman understand,
it is Mehreen’s issue.
[1890.36] How can we convince her?
[1894.52] You leave that to me.
[1896.36] Shaista, don’t do anything that will 
put Mehreen’s life in danger.
[1900.68] Yes, so let it be in danger.
[1903.44] Salman, really loves Mehreen,
[1905.76] if something happens to her, 
then he can do anything.
[1910.08] Wow.
[1912.32] Here only Mehreen’s life is important.
[1917.68] The life of others have no worth.
[1920.24] You don’t need to interfere in 
Mehreen’s decision directly.
[1963.80] Salman, I wanted to ask you something.
[1970.36] Yes, go ahead.
[1976.16] If you want to bring another woman 
in my place for the sake of a child,
[1982.36] then give me poison
[1985.16] or kill me,
[1988.48] because I want to make the decision 
of my life myself.
[1993.92] Arooj, do you think our lives 
are separate?
[2001.92] You are the one separating me 
from your life,
[2006.08] so what do I say?
[2008.64] Who told you that 
I am separating you?
[2016.32] Aunt Mehreen.
[2018.80] Let her speak.
[2020.56] What difference does it make? 
She talks a lot.
[2024.20] It makes a difference.
[2026.52] It surely makes a difference Salman,
[2029.80] because you never ignore anything 
aunt Mehreen says.
[2037.44] Arooj, maybe you are forgetting
[2040.44] that I married you going 
against mama.
[2054.40] Salman, I am really disturbed.
[2056.96] I don’t understand anything.
[2064.08] Arooj,
[2067.52] why are you worried?
[2074.84] Look, I am here.
[2078.64] Everything will be fine.
[2083.24] Trust me.
[2103.80] I am stuck really bad.
[2106.12] Such a weird situation.
[2108.52] Control it a little or your business 
will face difficulty.
[2113.32] How do I control it?
[2115.92] You know, mama, 
she just wants a grandson.
[2120.08] Let her insist,
[2122.08] this is the story of every home.
[2125.28] Man, if it was something small, 
I would have taken it easy.
[2128.76] But things have gotten out of hands.
[2131.52] What do you mean?
[2132.64] She is talking about my second marriage.
[2136.20] Oh,
[2138.08] so that’s the thing.
[2141.24] You know
[2143.00] how worried Arooj was,
[2145.12] the difficulty with which 
I took care of her?
[2148.28] Man, Salman, you know 
why this is so complicated?
[2151.40] Because aunty is really stubborn. 
Tell me, what will you do now?
[2156.28] Man, I don’t understand anything.
[2158.88] I really love Arooj, 
I cannot leave her.
[2161.44] And aunty?
[2164.52] Is this something you even have to ask?
[2166.04] I am not asking you, 
I am reminding you
[2168.20] of the problem you are getting stuck in.
[2172.16] Man, I don’t understand,
[2175.32] I love both of them a lot,
[2178.40] I cannot break anyone’s heart.
[2184.00] Now you tell me. Advise me.
[2188.92] Right now I have no advice.
[2192.64] It is just about waiting and watching.
[2194.76] Have faith in God, buddy.
[2198.92] Okay come on, relax. 
Let’s go to a coffee shop,
[2203.28] then we will see.
[2209.20] Where did it go?
[2212.96] I don’t know. 
I don’t understand.
[2214.92] Where can it go?
[2225.00] Where can the things go?
[2227.44] Oh.
[2235.68] Aunty.
[2241.92] I wanted to talk to you about something.
