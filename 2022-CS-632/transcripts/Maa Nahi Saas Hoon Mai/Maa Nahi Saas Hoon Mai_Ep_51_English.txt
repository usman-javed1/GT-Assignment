The guesses you are making 
to find out what it is, maybe you won’t be able to know it. Because maybe I too just 
found out about this. Look, if there is anything 
you can share it with me. I can hear it. Okay come on, let’s go. 
Where? To meet your mother. Mama? Let’s go home Salman. Let’s just go to our home. I am really tired. Let’s go home. Let’s go. This girl has driven everyone mad. Neither is she present here at home,
nor is she at her parents’ home. But elder madam, how did you find out all this? I had called Salman, he too is searching for that girl. This is something worrisome. Arooj is the second name of worry, she has become a problem for us. Okay, okay, don’t worry, God will make it all fine. I will bring tea for you. You are here, finally. Where did you find her 
and bring her back? I am asking you something, Salman. Does my question have any value 
in your eyes or not? Mom, why are you saying that? Then what else do I say? Huh? This girl is missing from the home 
since morning. Arooj was with me. She was with you? But you had said that 
you are searching for her. Arooj’s phone got turned off, so I got worried I said it to you
 in my worry. You wait. Salman, do you know, this Arooj addressed your mother 
calling her mad. Yes, it is Sabrina’s birthday,
she wants to celebrate it in Dubai. So let’s plan, huh? Yes, come in. What happened? Come madam. Where do I come? 
What happened? To the lounge. A new case has been opened there. Against whom? Madam, you know there is just one criminal in this home. Younger madam. And Mehreen must have become 
the judge of that case. This woman has gone completely mad. Hey, madam, this is the case. She is saying that younger madam
 called her mad. and if this is true, Salman, then this means your mother 
is a mad woman. She is a mental patient. Do you think your mother is mad? This is the limit to misbehaviour. I have given birth to you, I have brought you up and made you 
a successful person and she says that your mother is a mad woman. 
She is a mental patient. Do I look mad to you, Salman? Arooj, what is this I hear? Arooj, answer me. Do you have an answer for 
what mom has said? What will she say? I had heard it with my own ears. She was telling her mother 
on the phone that aunt Mehreen is mad. Do I really seem mad to you? Arooj, do you think my mom is like that? Salman, what do you mean by look like this? You too are calling your mother 
mad with her. Arooj, why are you standing quietly?
 Answer me. I am sorry aunty. I am really sorry. Stop. Your sorry is you admitting that whatever mom has said is true. I apologize to you too, Salman. Aunty, please forgive me. Arooj. Go to your room child. You made her apologize? Huh? That too for something 
she has not said. Sister in law, Shaista I have heard it with my own ears. Those were my words. I had said that to her. I had told her that Mehreen is not 
that bad at heart, she is just a little mad. Mehreen you are so strict to children, I said this to her to console her. Now, she must have heard it and 
repeated it somewhere. That’s it. The only word you could think 
of was mad? Wasai, pick up the tea and take it away. Yes, elder madam. About aunt Mehreen, she believes that I should ignore what 
aunt Mehreen says, she is a mental patient. But mama, how can you live 
with a mental patient. She… Aunty, I…
So I am a mental patient? I am mad? I get attacks? No aunty, that… Shut up! Who were you telling that 
I am a mental patient? I was talking to mama. Arooj, you are the limit child. Was this something to say? What? That Mehreen is a mental patient. Now Mehreen has another weapon
in her hands against you. In fact you have handed it 
over yourself. Child, do you have any idea the difficulty with which 
I handled the situation? and whatever she does with me, can someone in their right mind
 do this? I can understand child. 
You are right. But you don’t say these things. Be careful..
Lives pass in being careful. Don’t do this, don’t do that. 
Don’t go here, don’t go there. Be careful about everything. To the extent that I have restrictions
on breathing in this home. I know how you are tolerating Mehreen 
in this home, child. But child, I am worried why you have this sorrow, this sadness on your face. What is the real issue? Leave it, aunt. There is no solution to this problem. This has now become my fate. Thank you God. Hey, why did you make tea 
and bring it? I would have made it myself. You should rest. You too need tea after food. Keep it. Did Arooj call? Yes, I got a call but from Salman,
 not Arooj. Really? What was he saying? 
Where was she? She was sitting at the sea side. At the sea side? What was she doing there? She must want to see the sea. That’s why she didn’t come 
to see her mother? No master, 
there is surely something. I know my Arooj. Don’t you remember, even if I would have a headache, then she would stand next to me 
all night long. Now I fainted, I came back 
from the hospital. My child, Arooj, 
didn’t come to meet me. You are thinking for no reason. It is something to think
 about Master. What is the thing that
 you think so much about it? You get so worried? Master, don’t you find Arooj’s behaviour 
to be extra ordinary? There must be some tension that 
she is not telling anyone. Us? We are anyone? Can she not even tell her parents? Okay, now you know she is fine. Call in the morning, 
you will be satisfied. I will call her, but I will only be satisfied 
when I meet her. Leave it, I will pick it up. You rest. Did you take your medication? Yes, I did. You rest after taking medication. I will only find rest 
when I talk to Arooj. Master, if you drop something delicate 
and it breaks, then you feel sorrow. But there is no fear of being 
answerable. Hey, who do we have to answer to and why do we have to answer. We don’t doubt the sincerity 
of our love. We found Arooj, we kept her close to our heart. We didn’t have a daughter of our own. We gave Arooj all the love. We brought her up. Now Arooj is our daughter. Why are you surprised Arooj? I came to praise you on your victory. I am surprised. I feel you are not able to sleep out 
of happiness of your victory. What happiness of victory, aunty? I am a lost girl. You say these filmy dialogues
in front of Salman. I am not going to be impressed 
with these tears of yours. I am not shedding these tears for you, I am shedding them for myself. Another dialogue. I know well about the innocence 
behind this face of your, Arooj. Then teach me all this too. How do you read the faces of people? You should learn this from 
your mother, Arooj. Similar to the way she has 
taught you all other things well. How can you think so mercilessly, 
Mehreen? Do you not feel mercy on Arooj. If she speaks the truth, 
you think it is a lie. If her mother is unwell, 
you think it is a drama. How do I believe her? She used her mother’s health as an excuse
and is sitting at her mother’s home. So what do you think? Even her mother is lying? She is doing a drama of being unwell? Yes, it is absolutely possible. Oh my God. Mehreen, how much 
hatred do you have for Arooj in your heart? You didn’t like Arooj from day one, only because she is not yours, 
but Salman’s choice, right? Arooj didn’t come. Arooj found out about your ailment, still she didn’t come to see you. There must have been some issue 
with Mehreen. That’s it, she would be lying somewhere 
with her mobile switched off. If there was some issue there, 
she should have come here. If some issue happens 
with daughters, they should come to 
their parent's home. What can I say? I don’t know what situation my daughter 
would be going through. No master, there is surely something. I know my Arooj. Don’t you remember, even if I would have a headache, then she would stand next 
to me all night long. Now I fainted, I came back 
from the hospital. My child, Arooj, 
didn’t come to meet me. You are thinking for no reason. It is something to think about Master. Arooj’s mother is unwell, and she also knows that she fainted. She got treated at the hospital. Arooj would get up and come from 
her room on her mother coughing. But after hearing such a big news 
she went to the sea, instead of coming to see her mother. This is something extraordinary. I didn’t expect this. But this action of Arooj is a reaction
to something extraordinary or else Arooj cannot ignore 
this condition of her mother. What is it that has made you quiet? Arooj, what is the matter? If you trust me, then you can 
at least share it with me. Why do I feel there is a secret that you don’t want to share with me. It is better that some secrets, 
remain secrets. What do you mean? If they are revealed then it becomes a fun story for the world and the one whose secret it is, it becomes torture for them. Arooj, what are you saying? I feel I am talking to such an Arooj 
who I don’t know. Even I don’t know anything, but as much as I known, I wish. I was not able to even find out that. What is the matter Arooj? If you want, I can drop you to your mother’s home. You will feel better. No. Won’t you go to ask how she is? What happened to her? She must be fine. Why are you talking in 
such a cold tone? The ones who burn in their 
own sorrow, they become of this cold tone. If I am not wrong, then are you having an issue 
with your mother? With mama? I have no issue with mama. So, if there is no issue, 
then is there a misunderstanding? Yes, maybe. If misunderstandings are removed, then they hurt a lot. You have started to say 
difficult things again. Come on, get up, I will drop you 
at your mother’s home. You don’t stay upset with 
your mother for long. You look at me, my mother talks to me so strictly, I still don’t get upset. I get fine.
 Come on, come. I don’t want to go anywhere. 
Please. Leave me alone. Salman. It is good I found you here, 
I was coming to your room. Go ahead, son. Are you worried? 
Is everything fine?
