Where can it go? Where can the things go? Oh. Aunty. I wanted to talk to you about 
something. You do what you think for Salman. Yes, I know that. Why are you telling this to me? Because Salman’s life is not
 just connected with you, it is also connected with me. So fine, let it be connected. If you had a daughter and she couldn’t be a mother, then would you also have 
gotten her divorced. Firstly, I don’t have a daughter, and secondly, who told you that 
you are getting a divorce? So, what do I take the meaning 
of the decision you have made? Look Arooj, it is Salman’s right to 
get married again and especially when you cannot
 give him a child. So, have you made your decision that you will get Salman 
married again? Yes. Absolutely. And what is the harm in this? What is wrong in this? You think that there is nothing wrong
 in all that you are going to do? Yes, I feel that way and my decision cannot be 
wrong either. Fine, then you also hear my decision too. I can never share Salman 
with some other girl. Oh wow, who gave you the option to 
make this decision? You cannot make any decision, neither can you give your opinion. You are only in a position to accept it, and that’s it. I don’t know where it went! 
Why can I not find it? What is the need to adopt a child, what is the problem? The problem is in Arooj, not you. That is why I have decided, that you will get married again. Look Arooj, it is Salman’s right to get married 
again and especially when you cannot give him a child. There are certain courts 
in the world, Arooj, where there is no room 
to make an appeal. What appeal are you talking about? I know all about you going around 
outside aunt Mehreen’s room. Stay in your limit, Alizeh. You are Salman’s friend, 
that is why I respect you. This is a matter between me 
and my mother-in-law. None of your business, okay? You are right. But when things leave the room, then you cannot say none 
of your business. You are the guest of this home. It would be better that you consider 
yourself a guest, only. Arooj you will find out soon, who is 
the guest and who will live permanently. Guest. I heard everything you said, Arooj. Nothing to worry about. How is that? Look Arooj, Salman is not a child, who will be married forcefully. And after all, Salman is only thinking 
about you. But I am scared of aunt’s stubbornness. Hey leave it, God knows if he will get married or not. But tell me, has aunty chosen 
a girl for Salman? Do you know? I don’t know. But I know. What do you know? Who is she? Tell me. You remember I had mentioned 
that girl, Alizeh. Yes. Oh, meaning… meaning you mean aunty is thinking 
about Alizeh. It is possible my guess is wrong, but I feel this way. But, what does Alizeh have? 
How can you say that? Arooj, I have always noticed, 
she tries to degrade you. Why? I will fix this Mehreen’s madness 
in two minutes. What is wrong? She has made everyone’s life hell. What is this madness that she will make sure 
she does what she likes? So, what is new in this? 
She always does this. No, Idrees, we are dying worrying for her life 
and she is becoming death for us. Why are you getting so hyper? This has been happening for twenty years. Yes, we were tolerating it for twenty years,
 because it was limited to us. Now it has come on my son and 
daughter-in-law, I will not tolerate it. Shaista. Shaista. Shaista. 
You are angry right now. Be strong and have patience. I cannot be strong. You do something or 
I will do something. Okay, fine. I will talk to Salman, but you don’t argue with
 Mehreen at all. Okay? Okay. Bye. I am disappointed Shanzay. One medical report has taken me out 
of the list of people who can become a mother. what is wrong with you, Arooj? This is not as ordinary as you think. I know. I know it is nothing ordinary, 
it is important. Then I also think that it is possible 
the report is wrong. They could have made a mistake. This is also a possibility. Yes, that is also possible. But it is not necessary that you trust one single lab test and 
you get disappointed in it. That is why I have asked mama to 
take an appointment from her gynaecologist. We will get your checkup done
from there. Yes, but I will have to ask Salman
 for that. Hey, what is the need to tell Salman? We will go quietly. If the report is like earlier, 
then we will sit quietly. If not, then we will tell everyone. Yes, you are right. Okay fine, I will bring my bag, you have your tea. 
Fine. Arooj. Where are you two going? I am asking you something. Aunty, I was taking Arooj to 
my mama’s doctor, for a checkup. What? With whose permission? And Arooj, you won’t even inform me before 
going somewhere. We were coming to inform you. There is no need. Why do you want to make a joke 
out of this home again and again? If you have got the reports once, then why do you want to get 
the test done again and again. But aunty, there is no problem 
in taking a second opinion. Shanzay, you are Arooj’s friend and that is fine, but don’t interfere in the matters
 of this home. My friend doesn’t have permission 
to interfere in my matters, and Salman’s friend has full right 
to interfere in our lives. Fine. You leave, Shanzay. We are not going anywhere. Drama. Mehreen has made a weird decision. Will you do what she says? Not at all. I will not do this at all. But she will make you agree to it. Tell me, what is Arooj’s fault that 
I punish her like this? I know that as well, but I also know 
Mehreen’s stubbornness. So, will we do whatever mama says? I am really worried in this, you do something. That’s what I am asking you uncle. What do I do? Advise me. Tell me, has aunty chosen 
a girl for Salman? Do you know? I don’t know. But I know. What do you know? Who is she? Tell me. You remember I had mentioned 
that girl, Alizeh. It is possible my guess is wrong, but that’s what I feel. Arooj, I have always noticed, 
she tries to degrade you. Why? Alizeh is making moves against me, 
openly, without any fear. What is the reason for 
this confidence of her? Who gave her this confidence that she has become completely 
fearless? There are certain courts 
in the world, Arooj, where there is no room
to make an appeal. What appeal are you talking about? I know all about you going around 
outside aunt Mehreen’s room. When it is difficult to display 
yourself as great, then people degrade those
in front of themselves and try to increase their height. Such people fall on their face. Wasai, all the arrangement 
should be proper. Yes, madam. And no one will say a word more, or hear a word more than 
I have told you. Make all the servants understand 
that if there is any mistake, then I will fire them on the spot. Yes, as you order, madam. Leave. 
Okay. Wasai. Yes, madam. Are some guests coming over? 
Do we have a party? Yes, elder madam’s guests 
are coming over. So really affluent family. The party is for their daughter 
and younger master. This means, Mehreen will do 
what she wants and thinks. Fine, you leave. Okay. No, no, remain seated. In fact, sit comfortably over here. Because you cannot do anything. What do I do, aunt? Why are you getting angry with me? Then who should I get angry with?
Huh? Why are you so passive? You sit quietly like a sculpture 
made of sand, and all the matters of the home come 
and hit you. what do I say aunt? 
I don’t understand anything. They are preparing for your husband’s 
second marriage outside. The girl’s family is coming for a party. The same style again. What do I do, aunt? Everything happened so hastily. We just spoke yesterday and today… what can I do? That’s how Mehreen is. This is her biggest issue. If she thinks of something, she does it mercilessly. I cannot do anything. For me, there is no one 
who will speak for me. Even Salman tried a lot, but… I know Salman and it is not easy to stand 
in front of Mehreen. She takes full advantage of her illness. And we are left staring, 
we cannot do anything. But that’s it. Not anymore. I will talk for you. Come with me. Come on. Come with me. Okay. So Wasai spread the news 
in the entire home. Anyway, I don’t care. Why? Had Wasai not told us, would we not have found out. Anyway, Arooj, you tell me. Don’t talk to Arooj, talk to me. Yes, sister-in-law. You go ahead. Say whatever you want, but I will not step back. Mehreen, how can you do this? The same way the mothers of 
other boys do it. Other boys also have wives. Are they not someone’s daughters? This is something the mothers of 
those daughters should think. You tell me something. What will you tell people about Arooj 
in this drama of proposals. I will take care of all that myself. I will go to mama’s home. So that you have no difficulty. Don’t you dare step foot 
out of this home. If you step out once, then 
you will never come back. Do you people want to say something 
else, or that’s it? Come on. You people have tea. 
Sure. Sure. Salman has a lot of respect in 
the Canadian business community and I have met him once over there. My son is a successful businessman
and person. Whoever meets him once, 
never forgets him. We have heard enough praises 
of Salman, now let us meet him. He must be on his way from the office. Sure. Okay, you didn’t introduce her, 
who is she? Err…this is Arooj. My… there, Salman is here too. Greetings. Greetings. Meet them. Mom, who are these people? We had met once in 
the Canadian seminar. Yes, yes, I often meet people in 
the business seminar. How are you? 
Are you fine? Mom, what are these people
doing here? Salman, I… I had told you, Salman. 
Mom, please. Not again. Have you been introduced to her? I was about to introduce her. 
Mom, you leave it. I will introduce her. Meet her, she is Arooj. My wife. I think after this introduction, 
there is no room for anything else. What you people came here 
for cannot be fulfilled. If you want, 
you can have tea and go. Let’s go. Wasai, what are you staring at? 
Remove these things. What were you doing there? I am asking you something, 
what were you doing there? Alizeh and aunty said that… What did they want? And why were you sitting there? What do you mean 
what they wanted? What do I tell you? Arooj, they were fixing your husband’s wedding, and you were sitting there quietly? Why are you scolding me, Salman? Aunty said that sit here, don’t leave. So, I sat. and Alizeh? Why is she so active in this entire matter? I have no idea. Maybe… What, maybe? Tell me the complete thing. Maybe, Alizeh advised aunty about 
your second marriage. I will talk to her. wait, Salman. I said, maybe. And maybe I can also be wrong. I had set the entire matter. But here, aunty turned the tables. Maybe nothing that 
I had thought of will happen. I think I have to do something now. I will have to do something. Aunty. Aunty, I know the way Salman behaved
 with you in front of everyone, your heart is really hurt because of it, 
I know this. My Salman, was never like this. The way I wanted, as I thought, Salman always considered it holy. I know aunty. Actually, I am the one who knows this relation
of yours well. If you know, then how did my Salman 
forget all this? Aunty, because he has been 
made to forget it. There. Look at that picture. See that picture. Seeing this picture, it is not difficult to understand that 
you are two bodies and one life. Then how did someone do something 
so difficult, so easily? Aunty, I… I won’t take Arooj’s name, but… Aunty, listen to me. You two look so good together, right? Aunty, whatever decision you have made 
for Salman till today is really good, but can I give you an advice? Look, I know you are looking for a girl 
to get Salman married again. But this time, please, bring a girl 
after thinking hard. Please, aunty. Don’t bring anyone like Arooj, who distances you two from each other,
 completely. Bring such a girl, who stays happy with you, 
she makes you a family. She doesn’t separate you. Okay? Please, think about it.
