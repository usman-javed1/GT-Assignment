[56.44] Mom and dad, 
come let’s have breakfast.
[62.80] I don’t want to have breakfast.
[73.44] Make your dad have it.
[76.04] Nobody needs to worry 
about me at all.
[84.24] Hey, when the matter is over, 
why have sorrow on it?
[88.48] The matter is over?
[93.44] You fooled me for the past 
fourteen years.
[100.20] You deceived me.
[105.36] You will have to answer 
for that deceit.
[111.04] The matter is not over, 
it has begun.
[120.08] You are not ashamed of doing 
something like this.
[125.28] Shaista, if you continue to 
blow this out of proportions,
[127.44] I will leave the home and go.
[130.88] For God’s sake, please.
[134.04] Stop it you two.
[143.76] Don’t you know that we are already 
fighting a battle,
[146.48] and if you people do this,
[148.32] then we will become weak and 
our enemy will benefit.
[161.92] Now you people think about it.
[164.52] If you people want to fight like this,
then tell me.
[166.68] I will leave the home and go.
[240.32] Where is this girl?
[243.12] She still hasn’t come for breakfast.
[249.32] What is this, child, Arooj?
[251.00] You will have breakfast in a hurry?
[252.80] You should wake up a little early.
[254.88] Mama, Areej didn’t let me 
sleep all night,
[257.56] I couldn’t sleep properly.
[262.76] This is correct.
[266.56] You do one thing, child, 
make her sleep with me.
[273.04] Naseema, you are a deep sleeper,
[276.08] Areej will continue to cry and 
you wont even know.
[282.04] No child, don’t do that.
[288.08] Now, that is not true, master.
[292.36] Areej, if that is the matter then 
make Areej sleep with me.
[298.12] Okay anyway,
[299.72] I wanted to talk to you all about
something important.
[309.52] Especially to you, papa.
[311.48] Yes, yes, child, go ahead.
[313.36] I have spoken to the lawyer
[315.56] and I have also prepared 
all the documents.
[331.56] What are you going to do Arooj?
[336.36] You had told me that we shouldn’t 
take support from the law,
[341.40] or else everyone in the world will 
find out about this.
[345.12] Yes, child.
[352.24] But papa, things have now 
gotten out of hand.
[360.28] We will have to do legal proceedings 
to face these people.
[376.16] Arooj, what will you do now?
[380.12] I will not do it, mama, 
I have done it.
[395.60] I have filed a case on Salman, 
uncle Idrees and aunt Shaista.
[431.96] Anyway, I am getting late.
[433.92] I will come back and talk about 
the rest in the evening.
[435.72] Goodbye.
[436.96] Goodbye.
[462.08] Sister Mehreen, 
come on have breakfast.
[466.80] Sure.
[487.44] Master, have breakfast.
[516.04] Sir, the courier guy left this envelope.
[546.40] What is this?
[549.56] A notice from the court.
[558.00] Who sent it?
[561.32] Arooj has put a claim on the ownership
of the entire business and property.
[626.08] I knew it.
[632.20] I knew Arooj will do this one day.
[642.64] That is why we were being 
strict on her.
[651.76] That damned woman has good luck.
[659.36] We tried so much to get a grip 
on Arooj and her relatives.
[672.60] But, what happened?
[674.68] Nothing, and then on top of that
 we got this notice.
[684.68] Now will you say something
[686.24] or will us father and son worry 
to save this empire.
[691.12] You are worrying now.
[693.60] I kept this property, business and home
safe for the past twenty five years.
[717.12] And now we will lose it in minutes.
[720.00] Hey, how will we lose it like this?
[721.76] In court, arguments, evidence, 
and witnesses are required.
[745.72] Everything is against us.
[756.80] Nothing will go anywhere.
[771.00] I will hire the best of lawyers.
[789.60] The ruling will be in our favour.
[873.12] I have signed the file.
[875.48] You can also recheck with sir Nasir.
[878.40] Okay madam.
[882.16] Thank you. 
Okay madam, thank you.
[905.36] Hello.
[906.88] Hello.
[909.28] How are you Shanzay?
[911.64] All okay?
[912.84] You called so early in the morning.
[915.44] What is wrong? It is 10 am.
[918.80] Oh, I didn’t see the time.
[923.04] I called you to tell you that
[925.92] my case has been filed,
[928.32] and I have given the money 
I had with me to the lawyer.
[934.16] Yes,
[936.24] he is a principal oriented advocate.
[938.00] He messaged me immediately that 
your friend transferred the money.
[943.32] Yes,
[945.08] actually,
[947.20] I wanted to talk to you 
about something else.
[954.92] The lawyer is someone you know,
[958.56] in fact, he is your cousin,
[961.96] so I think that he will listen 
to you more.
[967.96] Yes, go ahead?
[971.04] Is it possible, Shanzay,
[974.00] that I pay him the fees in the end, 
once the case is over?
[977.84] Hey Arooj, there is nothing
 to worry in this.
[980.36] He is a really good man
[987.24] and I just pray that 
you win this case.
[992.00] Thank you so much.
[994.56] Okay. Take care of yourself.
[997.16] We will talk again. Goodbye.
[999.36] Goodbye.
[1034.04] Arooj,
[1036.40] you know,
[1039.00] you have stood up against 
cruel people.
[1044.24] We are not oppressed, mama.
[1052.72] We can snatch our right,
[1062.24] and because of cowardice,
[1065.12] those people have become 
like Pharaoh today.
[1071.68] Arooj,
[1074.12] I have complete trust in your 
strong headedness.
[1085.04] But brother Idrees and 
sister in law Shaista,
[1088.24] can go to any extent.
[1101.48] You didn’t take Salman’s name.
[1110.64] Is it not amongst our opponents?
[1114.96] He is.
[1118.48] He is part of those people as well.
[1127.24] But…
But, what?
[1129.80] You don’t use words like if and 
but in between right and wrong, mama.
[1135.64] Either a person is right
[1138.52] or they are wrong,
[1140.52] and Salman is constantly 
doing wrong.
[1146.28] Anyway,
[1148.24] I am doing all this to get the right 
of my mother and daughter.
[1158.64] And no matter who comes 
in the way of it,
[1163.60] I will not forgive them.
[1313.04] Dad, come quickly, 
we are getting late.
[1320.16] Salman.
[1322.36] One second, wait son.
[1327.92] Did you keep all the documents?
[1330.12] Mom, what do we have apart from 
the caretaking documents.
[1338.80] Anyway, I gave them to the lawyer.
[1341.80] Yes, those won’t be enough.
[1346.68] So he will get more made, 
what does he charge us money for?
[1352.44] Okay, look, son Salman.
[1354.04] You have to control your anger.
[1361.52] You will not argue with Arooj 
and her mother, there.
[1365.84] What if it creates a new issue.
[1368.08] Mom, my anger is in control,
[1376.28] or else I wanted…
[1379.56] and I am angry, why such a 
big issue was created?
[1388.84] If dad had gotten the documents 
made twenty two years back,
[1391.44] then today, everything would 
have been in our control.
[1393.36] Yes, so how was I to know
[1395.64] that Arooj will come back and 
Mehreen will get fine too.
[1401.96] Yes, son, Salman. 
Shall we go?
[1409.84] You learn something from Salman.
[1413.96] I don’t understand.
[1417.40] That’s the issue.
[1420.20] You don’t understand.
[1431.84] I wish you too,
[1434.20] thought like your son, Salman.
[1447.12] I wish you wouldn’t have focused 
on luxury throughout your life.
[1462.48] And we wouldn’t have had 
to visit the court.
[1477.68] Good luck, son.
[1484.24] Shall we go?
[1557.96] Papa,
[1562.72] I am going to court.
[1566.00] You keep on lying down, rest.
[1571.32] I wish child I was in the condition 
that I too could go with you.
[1579.24] I am going to fight those people,
[1585.88] who have put you in this condition.
[1590.20] The same thing again.
[1596.80] Arooj is right.
[1607.40] Anyway, child, you go ahead
[1610.16] and what did you do about 
the lawyer’s fee?
[1623.80] I have some money with me, 
take it along.
[1626.36] No, I don’t need it right now.
[1629.00] I will ask you for it, when I need it.
[1638.12] So,
[1639.72] where did you get the money from?
[1645.72] Brother Nasir gave me some money.
[1661.48] I am very thankful to him, that 
he supported me in this time.
[1673.36] and Salman?
[1675.40] When did Salman do good with 
that good man?
[1682.28] Okay child.
[1685.04] Child, take a lot of care of you
and sister Mehreen.
[1693.00] Take different routes 
when coming and going.
[1705.24] When you have enemies,
you need to be careful.
[1714.76] Papa, you too accepted it.
[1723.92] Master knows everything,
he just doesn’t accept it.
[1730.60] Goodbye.
[1732.52] Goodbye.
[1736.00] May God protect our Arooj.
[1739.72] Amen.
[1786.16] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1787.48] Come on, the court proceeding 
is starting.
[1838.84] What are you thinking, Naseema.
[1843.20] Master,
[1846.44] I am really worried.
[1851.12] What does our Arooj have to do
with the court.
[1861.56] I don’t know what sort 
of people are there,
[1866.00] and what topics will they discuss?
[1870.04] “It’s a different world there, Naseema.
[1873.00] Once you get there, the true meaning
of the word witness box becomes apparent.
[1877.92] Why witness box are referred 
to as the witness box’
[1881.64] Lawyers use such questions, 
such tricky language,
[1885.40] that a person is left perplexed.
[1888.36] Really?
[1890.56] So, this should be there for 
the accused, right?
[1894.88] Hey, whether it is the accused 
or the defendant,
[1896.88] it is difficult to keep your tone strong 
in front of those questions and arguments.
[1906.96] God.
[1908.96] God.
[1910.28] God, give courage to our Arooj.
[1913.20] Amen.
[1922.16] Oh God, have mercy 
on my daughter.
[1926.04] God, make all matters easy for her.
[1930.12] Remove all her difficulties.
[1933.16] Amen.
[2024.32] Begin the proceedings of the case.
[2030.64] Your Honor,
[2032.40] my client Arooj Ahmad has filed 
a claim of ownership of her father.
[2039.40] I request permission to summon 
Arooj Ahmad to the witness box.
[2043.28] You have my permission.
[2082.44] Mr. Judge, this is Arooj Ahmad,
[2084.56] she has filed a claim on the ownership
 of her father’s wealth,
[2087.64] which her father had put in her name
twenty two years back.
[2115.72] Arooj, please apprise the court 
of your stance.
[2120.08] Mr. Judge,
[2121.64] as my lawyer has told you,
[2124.20] my father had put all his property and 
wealth in my name at the time of my birth.
[2135.92] But suddenly, he passed away 
in an accident.
[2153.40] My father’s entire wealth and property 
has been taken over by his brother,
[2157.36] that is my uncle.
[2182.12] My mother was not in such 
a condition that
[2185.56] she could take care of all this.
[2198.48] That is why I request you to get me
my right back.
[2205.44] Yes, the defendant’s lawyer
[2207.12] would you like to inquire something
from Arooj Ahmad?
[2291.00] No, Mr. Judge,
[2293.68] right now I don’t want 
to ask her anything.
[2300.84] You can leave.
[2308.64] Thank you, your honour.
