[52.44] You are back?
[53.88] I am that is why you can see me.
[56.44] what happened? 
You called me so many times,
[58.68] is everything okay?
[59.88] No, nothing is okay.
[63.60] What happened Urooj?
[65.48] Come in, I will tell you.
[67.24] tell me what happened?
[69.44] Is everything okay?
[71.64] I said come in I will tell you.
[76.76] Let’s go.
[131.32] Happy Birthday.
[138.64] You remember my birthday?
[141.32] Hmm.
[142.80] Impressive, I didn’t remember at all.
[147.96] The ones you love
[151.08] you must remember everything 
about them.
[157.16] Thank you so much.
[158.96] You’re welcome.
[161.24] I think let’s cut the cake, the poor cake
has been waiting for you for so long.
[164.80] Come.
[173.88] How did you like the cake?
[176.00] Very beautiful and yummy as well.
[182.56] Ready?
[183.88] Yep.
[186.40] Happy Birthday to you.
[189.80] Happy Birthday to you.
[192.84] Happy Birthday dear Salman,
[196.00] Happy Birthday to you.
[199.48] Thank you so much.
[202.56] Take it.
[205.80] Now I will feed you.
[210.68] Happy Birthday.
[213.12] Thank you so much.
[214.68] You’re welcome.
[217.40] And here is your birthday present.
[226.32] What is this?
[227.52] Look at it yourself.
[246.52] For you.
[253.84] It’s beautiful.
[255.40] Won’t you make me wear it? 
Why not?
[259.68] Wait a second.
[266.76] Salman, do you know why have I 
gifted you this watch?
[270.84] Hmm, why?
[272.32] So that next time you can look at the time 
and come home early.
[278.04] In fact, there is another special thing 
about this watch.
[281.88] Really what’s that?
[284.72] I have set everyone’s birthday alarm
 in this watch.
[289.96] Really?
[291.48] But I am not interested in remembering 
anyone’s birthday,
[296.24] I just want to remember your birthday.
[302.96] I knew it.
[305.12] That is why there is just mine and 
your reminder set in this watch.
[310.96] Really? 
Hmm.
[316.76] Thank you so much, 
Urooj for making my day.
[323.56] You know what?
[326.08] I love you so much.
[328.16] I love you too.
[385.28] Good Morning.
[386.64] Good Morning, Good morning.
[389.24] Come, let’s have breakfast.
[391.48] Mom,
[394.92] actually I had my breakfast 
in the room only
[398.60] because I was getting late for work.
[405.88] Where did you get this from?
[407.68] I never saw it on your hands 
ever before.
[410.48] This,
[412.28] Urooj has gifted this.
[416.88] Oh okay, Urooj has gifted it? 
But why?
[420.04] I mean there must be an occasion 
to gift something.
[425.44] Mom,
[426.96] it is my birthday today,
[429.68] did you forget?
[431.20] I? No…
[433.48] not at all. Why would I forget?
[435.68] Look, I knew you can never 
forget this day.
[439.52] After all, how can I forget?
[443.92] Umm, show it to me.
[445.32] Watch? 
Hmm.
[446.92] Look.
[449.84] Do you like it?
[451.96] Hmm,
[454.72] it is not very special,
[457.20] I mean that Urooj’s choice 
is not very good,
[461.72] her choice is very ordinary.
[464.68] It means you didn’t like it.
[467.56] No, like I said, it is just okay.
[475.68] okay I am getting late for office;
[478.40] I will see you tonight. Take care.
[480.44] Take care. Bye.
[495.48] How can I forget it?
[513.20] You?
Hmm.
[516.16] You didn’t come for breakfast so I thought
that I should go and check myself.
[519.68] How are you?
[521.44] I am fine.
[523.60] Hmm,
[524.76] I can see that.
[526.36] And I guess you are more than just fine
[529.56] but it is wrong to be even more than fine.
[535.36] I don’t understand what you are saying.
[538.88] It will take you a lot of time to understand 
the relationship between myself and my Salman.
[546.92] As far as I have understood,
[549.08] I think that there is more than 
usual mother-son love,
[553.76] and I like that you guys are so attracted 
towards each other.
[557.80] Wrong,
[558.96] I just told you that acting nicer than 
required is also equal to being bad,
[565.04] anyway, leave all this,
[566.52] I just came to ask why didn’t you come 
down for breakfast with Salman?
[570.64] There wasn’t any special reason,
[572.64] Salman had to leave early today 
so that is why.
[575.52] Hmm.
[577.04] That is what I wanted to hear.
[579.72] You gifted a watch to Salman
[582.52] but to win Salman’s heart you have 
to match your time with his time.
[590.60] Gifting watches doesn’t help.
[642.16] Madam?
[646.88] What happened? 
Do you want to say something?
[649.84] I am just scared to talk big 
with this small mouth.
[655.08] No, tell me what is it?
[663.72] Madam,
[666.20] Madam Jr is very nice, 
she really loves Sir.
[673.64] Okay so that is great,
[676.00] what problem do you have with it?
[677.60] No madam,
[679.72] I don’t have a problem, 
she has a problem…
[682.72] I know that you are talking 
about Mehreen.
[687.76] What can I do?
[690.08] Your sir has stopped me.
[693.00] Now look,
[694.64] Sir and Madam Jr cannot get away 
with Madam Sr’s eyes even in their room.
[703.88] I feel so pity for madam Jr,
[708.24] now look she has just 
newly gotten married
[712.04] and the same old mother-in-law 
and daughter in law games.
[717.20] Are you done talking?
[719.92] No, no madam,
[721.56] I told you because 
you asked me to tell.
[725.36] Look Wasai,
[726.92] I am already very worried 
because of all this,
[729.84] now these talks are making 
my heart heavier.
[734.28] Now go and do your work.
[736.00] Madam, don’t worry,
[739.44] God will make everything fine,
[742.28] I will go make cold sorbet for you.
[766.68] So how did brother Salman 
like your gift?
[769.44] Salman really like it but…
[772.76] What but Urooj,
[774.04] we have nothing to do with people
after that but.
[778.72] Yes,
[780.08] but we get to interact with them,
[783.44] and Salman and I don’t have 
personal life anyway.
[788.88] It means aunt Mehreen turned out 
to be a typical mother-in-law?
[794.00] In fact, she is even worse than 
a typical mother-in-law.
[798.80] At least other mothers-in-law give their 
sons and daughter in laws a chance to breath,
[803.88] she doesn’t even do that.
[807.08] So Urooj, you must talk to 
brother Salman about this.
[811.16] What should I say to Salman, Shanzey?
[815.08] Do you know I am even scared to talk 
to Salman about aunt Mehreen,
[820.80] he gets crazy in a second 
and he gets angry
[825.92] then I don’t know what should I do.
[830.60] Do you know
[831.92] the craze he had to get me;
[836.24] I get to see that very rarely now.
[840.20] Why? Where did the hero’s craze go?
[845.12] God knows.
[846.56] Looks like there is a problem going on,
my friend.
[850.08] I can solve the problem but
[854.44] I am unable to get hold of the problem.
[857.92] According to my inexperience, 
are you laughing right now?
[862.12] Are you stupid?
[864.24] I would laugh at such a serious conversation, 
Shanzey? Come on, dude.
[868.36] Good, so you just need to get hold 
of brother Salman’s love.
[901.96] May I come in? 
Yes, yes please. Come in.
[905.36] Sit, sit. 
No, no, first you sit down.
[914.88] Urooj, my child, 
you are a very nice girl,
[917.88] you are so loving.
[920.76] Thank God,
[921.96] at least someone realized it,
[925.68] else, aunt Mehreen does not think 
about this at all.
[930.12] My child, you must not talk what 
Mehreen says personally to your heart.
[935.80] She attacks on the heart every time,
[938.68] how can you save yourself?
[944.64] That is how Mehreen is,
[947.64] we are tolerating her in this house,
[951.32] you must do it too.
[954.48] But I am tolerating all this 
for Salman, aunt.
[959.44] I know that,
[962.12] you just focus on your own life,
[965.16] stay happy. Hmm?
[967.68] And remember one thing,
[969.64] I am always with you.
[975.20] Your support is my strength
[980.64] else I would have shattered 
long time back.
[1017.56] Mom, actually I had my breakfast 
in the room
[1021.68] only because I was getting late for work.
[1029.00] Where did you get this from?
[1030.64] I never saw it on your hands ever before.
[1033.44] This,
[1035.32] Urooj has gifted this.
[1039.96] Oh okay, Urooj has gifted it? 
But why?
[1043.12] I mean there must be an occasion 
to gift something.
[1048.40] Mom, it is my birthday today,
[1052.56] did you forget?
[1063.72] Urooj as celebrated Salman’s birthday
before me today,
[1072.40] what does she think?
[1075.28] She will take my place in Salman’s 
heart by doing that?
[1081.32] Salman is my son,
[1083.88] he is just my son.
[1087.00] I will give such a gift to Salman today
[1091.04] that all other gifts will become 
unimportant in front of it.
[1105.36] Did you tell Mr. Akmal about 
tomorrow’s meeting?
[1107.56] yes, I have made arrangements, 
they are just waiting for you.
[1109.84] Okay, you may go I will come.
[1112.32] Sir.
[1117.28] Hello?
[1120.04] I hope you weren’t busy.
[1122.84] Busy? Yes, I am busy,
[1125.56] I was just going for a meeting.
[1127.80] hmm,
[1129.44] that means you are busy?
[1132.16] Urooj, you are unbelievable,
[1135.00] I am getting late for a meeting.
[1138.36] So, then you are busy.
[1140.92] Obviously,
[1142.32] now if you may allow, 
may I go for the meeting?
[1144.92] Umm, wait a minute,
[1146.44] by the way I have called 
for some work too.
[1151.08] What is that work? 
Tell me?
[1154.28] Umm,
[1156.40] what is the time right now?
[1157.96] Time?
[1160.00] It’s 4 o clock.
[1162.60] Thank you,
[1163.92] I just wanted to ask that.
[1168.92] Take care. Bye.
[1231.60] Wasai? Wasai?
[1233.88] yes, madam Sr? I am here.
[1236.24] Wasai, go and bring the keys 
to the store room.
[1239.72] Keys to the store room? 
Is everything okay, madam?
[1243.16] Yes, everything is fine.
[1245.24] There is a Salman’s toy from 
his very first birthday,
[1248.56] bring that.
[1250.20] But all Sir Salman’s things are 
scattered in the store room,
[1253.84] how will I recognize it?
[1266.44] Teddy bear.
[1268.80] Teddy bear?
[1272.12] Okay, okay I get it, I will bring it.
[1275.96] wait, I will come with you,
[1278.76] you might damage his other toys.
[1281.20] Come, let’s go.
[1293.32] Stop.
[1298.12] Where are you going?
[1301.44] I had some work downstairs, 
that is why.
[1305.32] I asked you not to go to that side,
[1308.12] why are you going there?
[1309.80] You know there is a store room there.
[1313.96] There might be, 
I guess I don’t know.
[1316.44] There might? There is.
[1319.24] There is no need to go there 
now go away from here.
[1322.08] Okay.
[1326.40] Now if you go away only then 
I can go down.
[1330.32] I can only go there if you move.
[1333.48] Okay.
[1357.80] I have even stopped her
[1360.24] and told her she has nothing 
to do with the store room,
[1363.56] there are just treasures of memories
of me and my Salman
[1367.44] and today, I have to give 
Salman a surprise that…
[1374.20] Wasai,
[1375.88] where are you? 
Come already.
[1377.48] yes, yes, madam, coming. 
Come quickly.
[1383.56] Wasai, give me the keys.
[1385.24] Okay madam.
[1399.36] Look at the condition of this place.
[1413.88] It is not here.
[1415.68] Where would it be?
[1419.64] What are you looking for, madam?
[1422.24] Wasai, you will just find it out, 
you will just find it out.
[1433.12] I asked you not to go to that side,
[1436.00] why are you going there?
[1438.48] You know there is store room there.
[1442.52] There is no need to go there 
now go away from here.
[1451.12] Like it’s not a store room 
but a secret basement,
[1455.32] God knows what is buried there.
[1471.52] Who opened the door of this room today?
[1475.04] Uff! If Mehreen sees it…
[1481.16] Mehreen, what are you doing here?
[1483.32] First you tell me, 
what are you doing here?
[1485.68] nd look please, don’t touch anything.
[1490.68] I cannot find it.
[1493.96] This here…
[1496.92] God forbid,
[1497.96] look at the condition of this place. 
Hold this Wasai.
[1501.28] You should come and sometimes 
see this place and clean it.
[1504.64] You never take care of it.
[1513.84] This picture?
[1521.96] Take this picture quickly, 
go throw it.
[1534.88] Oh God.
[1556.84] This?
[1558.16] This? Where did Wasai go?
[1560.88] She went to throw away the picture frame.
[1565.56] Why sister-in-law? 
Why did she go to throw it?
[1567.52] There might be some old memorable 
picture of my Salman.
[1572.04] No Mehreen, it had no picture,
[1574.68] it was just an empty frame and there were 
termites in it so I got it thrown away.
[1581.00] Okay, you did well
[1583.32] but why can’t I find it?
[1585.56] I should be able to find it 
I kept it here only.
[1588.32] After all, what are you looking 
for Mehreen?
[1590.72] Sister-in-law, you will get to know it, 
everyone will get to know it,
[1593.40] you will see that everyone will 
get to know that
[1595.20] but I should find it.
[1597.84] I should be able to see it here
in front of me.
[1599.72] It was so beautiful.
[1624.16] Did you throw that frame?
[1628.04] Yes madam, I threw it outside.
[1631.84] Yes, don’t take it home, 
it had termites.
[1635.40] no madam,
[1637.12] you know I don’t take anything 
from here to my home.
[1642.00] I did as you asked me to.
[1646.24] Okay you may go. 
Okay.
[1665.36] Keep sitting.
[1672.96] Miss Sadia,
[1674.16] you will hit the construction site 
from today onwards.
[1676.76] okay sir.
[1677.68] If you have any kind of problem
[1680.08] or you need to discuss anything, 
you can discuss it with me.
[1684.32] Okay sir.
[1686.68] This project is very important 
for all of us,
[1690.52] I won’t tolerate any slacking in it 
of any sort.
[1693.68] Is that all right?
[1694.96] Don’t worry, sir, you won’t get 
a chance to complain.
[1698.00] And Mr. Nawaz?
[1700.96] Yes?
[1702.04] Because you are heading 
the finance department,
[1704.40] make sure payments are made in time.
[1707.40] yes sir.
[1708.56] There shouldn’t be any delay.
[1711.24] If you face any problem with funding, 
if there is any sort of issue,
[1714.68] you can call me anytime.
[1716.40] Okay sir.
[1717.36] And one more thing, 
if we succeed in this project,
[1721.36] you all will get a double bonus.
[1726.28] You may go now. 
Thank you, sir.
[1753.28] Wasai,
[1754.72] tell me how did termites get to 
the things of my Salman? Yes?
[1759.16] I have hired you here to slack?
[1762.16] Who will take care of my son’s things?
[1764.40] If next time this happens,
[1766.16] I will kill you know how dear are 
my Salman’s things are for me?
[1772.12] Yes, madam Sr.
[1775.12] What madam? Always.
[1777.16] Mehreen, what is wrong? 
Why are you getting angry?
[1780.40] I am scolding Wasai,
[1782.40] because of her termites have gotten
to the things of my Salman
[1784.72] and then she threw it in the trash too.
[1786.48] So, only you told me that 
it has mites in it
[1790.12] and the glass is broken too 
so throw it away,
[1792.36] so she threw it away.
[1796.40] I said so?
[1801.84] How can I say that and that too 
for my Salman’s things.
[1806.16] You said it in front of me.
[1808.32] Anyway, leave that look at this,
[1812.56] do you remember this?
[1815.12] This was Salman’s first toy.
[1818.48] It is so nice, right?
[1820.20] I was looking for this and
 I couldn’t find it.
[1824.00] It was kept in my cupboard.
[1826.76] Wasai, go and make tea for me 
and Mehreen.
[1832.16] Okay.
[1837.32] Let me just, let me just call Salman 
right now.
[1839.88] Let me give him a surprise.
[1843.88] Thank you, sister-in-law.
[1889.24] Madam Sr and sir Sr,
[1893.76] were so beautiful when young,
[1897.84] madam Sr became a widow 
while she was still young,
[1902.72] it is all about fate,
[1906.16] she birthed a daughter 6 years 
after her marriage
[1909.64] and that too went missing,
[1912.24] that was such a sad incident.
[1917.36] It is madam’s orders to burn this picture,
[1924.76] what should I do?
[1927.08] I have to obey the orders.
[1956.04] It is such a negative thing to burn 
the picture of someone who is still alive.
[1962.80] Sir Sr is not alive
[1965.80] but madam Sr is still alive
[1971.44] and her daughter Areej 
might be alive too.
[1981.76] No, no
[1984.08] I can never burn this picture,
[1988.96] but I have been ordered 
to burn the picture,
[1993.56] what should I do now?
[1996.68] Let me just hide this picture,
[2003.36] yes,
[2005.28] let me just hide it.
[2050.92] You?
[2053.52] You come to my room like this again 
and again, I don’t like it at all aunt,
[2057.64] you are my elder,
[2059.20] you should ask Wasai and 
she will call me.
[2064.24] I will do that from next time
[2066.68] but this time it was important 
for me to come.
[2069.76] Okay, tell me?
[2072.32] I am here to invite you.
[2075.40] What invitation.
[2076.88] Today is my son’s birthday,
[2079.48] get ready and come down 
in a while.
[2085.44] Okay.
[2089.44] Umm, do you have that to wrap the gift…
[2094.68] no, you just leave it, 
I don’t need it,
[2099.80] just don’t miss my son’s birthday.
[2140.60] My son’s gift,
[2142.72] after all her mother found it,
[2144.76] after all how wouldn’t she find it? yeah?
[2147.04] My Salman would be so happy 
to see his gift
[2152.24] but how can I show it to him like this?
[2156.68] It won’t look nice like this,
[2158.76] it should be gift wrapped,
[2162.08] what should I do?
[2163.72] Where should I get the gift wrap from?
I should ask someone to get it.
[2167.40] But it will take very long for me 
to ask someone to get it.
[2170.04] What should I do? 
Where should I look for it?
[2172.48] It might be in my cupboard. 
Let me find it.
[2178.56] Wasai?
[2180.24] yes madam?
[2182.04] Wasai, go and give these things 
to Aunt Mehreen, please.
[2187.08] But what is all this for madam?
[2190.12] She needs these things;
[2192.28] she just shouldn’t get to know 
that I have sent it for her.
[2195.36] You will give it to her, right?
[2196.84] Don’t worry madam,
[2198.68] has it ever happened that my madam 
asked me to do something
[2201.96] and I wouldn’t do it?
[2203.44] here.
[2205.40] Okay listen, I am waiting for you here,
[2207.48] once you give this to aunt, 
so do let me know.
[2210.72] Don’t worry, I will be right back.
[2212.96] Come soon.
