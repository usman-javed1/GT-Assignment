Wasai. Wasai. 
Yes, coming. Yes, younger madam. Where is Salman? He has come from the office, and he didn’t even come 
to the room. He outside in the lawn. Only Salman is responsible 
for this condition of mama. What does she want from him? Just a little love. And Salman is crossing the limit. What can I… I know, what can you say to anyone. Here, no one is willing 
to listen to anyone. I will see. God, have mercy on the condition 
of this home. How can you talk to me like this? Really? So, now you will teach me, 
how I should talk to you? Tell me, what have you come here for? Salman, you kept on walking on the terrace
all night long. You didn’t even come 
to the room. I know you are worried. Won’t you share it with me? Why should I share it with you? Because I am your wife. I had thought I would tell you myself, but you had promised me that you will help me in finding my parents. Forgive me, considering it a mistake. How can you be so stone hearted? She loves you so much. You know, she has not slept for two nights. So, what do I do? I have not taken up the responsibility
 of showing mercy on someone. Salman. She is not someone. She has loved you for 
twenty five years. She is your mother, and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen. Salman, you have been home for so long, you didn’t even come to the room. I feel suffocated in that corner. Go from here. I have no fault. In fact, no one has a fault…
Arooj, shut up. Stop this emotional drama of yours, go from here. What is this noise? Huh? Can you not see 
he is in a bad mood? Still you are disturbing him. I am talking to him. 
I am not disturbing him. You are disturbing him. Salman, son, 
you can go. You have come home tired 
from the office, you can lie down in my room. 
Go, come on. Sure, mom. And you too leave. Now Salman will stay with his mother, and you stay with your mother. My relation has suffered most in 
the battle between you two mothers. This relation is also only there 
for a few days. Now tell me, what you feel after hearing 
all that I said? Will Salman leave me? Arooj, I don’t understand 
brother Salman at all. Earlier he used to listen 
to aunt Mehreen, and now his parents. Why doesn’t he think 
anything himself? I don’t understand 
what Salman wants. Arooj, I feel he is going through
a big shock, you should let him be. Will doing this be right? Man, that’s what I believe in. Arooj, I had told you that Shaista will turn out to be an even 
worse mother-in-law than Mehreen. Look at my prediction. At times I think that what is 
happening with you is not right, I feel you have holes 
in your hands. Check, Check. Check
 if I am right or not. Hah, no, you won’t be able to see it, 
but I see it. You have holes in your hands. Because when Salman used 
to be a good husband, you couldn’t control Mehreen, and when you found 
the relation of your mother, your husband got distanced from you. I feel you don’t know 
how-to live-in relations. Relations are not kept in hands, they are kept in hearts. You count money with your hands. You don’t weigh emotions. Hah, but how would you know? You are that man who made 
your own son your nephew in the greed for money, and I am so stupid, I am making you understand all this. You are only left with words 
to talk about. Go ahead, talk as much as
 you want. I am making you understand 
for the last time. You and aunt, move from between Salman and I or don’t expect any good
 from me either. I feel she too has gone 
crazy like Mehreen. Now this puppet show is over. Salman will not listen
to you or Mehreen, because he has learned that I am his father and 
Shaista is his mother. Even if Salman has found out 
about this, then what is the reason for 
hating me and my mother? Very smart. You have found out really soon 
that Salman hates you. Yes, but why? It is better that you don’t get 
into this argument, and prepare to leave from 
Salman’s life, now. What are you saying? I am Salman’s wife. More than that you are 
Mehreen’s daughter. Okay, so Salman is speaking 
your language. See how you are talking and Shaista will stop 
this tongue on yours, because you are her daughter-in-law and she is your mother-in-law. What will you say and
what will I have to do? Good, so you are ready for the deal? What if I say no, then? You don’t have the option 
to say no. Think about it,
it is up to you. What have I done to you? You have done a lot to me and you know I deserve 
to take revenge. Now, you will take revenge from me? I leave this to you too. If you agree to me, then that’s it. Then you won’t take revenge? Nice, your statement has your 
admission of crime. Answer me. They are really greedy people. Whatever happened in the past, 
happened. But now everyone can 
live together again. But no, these people are not those 
who will live together. They only know how to torture. Maybe love hasn’t even
touched their lives and my mother? She only wants love. Younger madam, getting happiness is a difficult 
thing to do. At times you get it, and at times your efforts 
go to waste. Hmmm. You are absolutely right. Some relations support you and some look away from you. That’s how it is. Can I ask you something? Go ahead. I feel that uncle and aunt will not accept 
my relation with Salman. And this relation of ours 
will end soon. Younger madam, don’t worry. You don’t worry at all. How is that? Because, that elder sir and madam are 
really greedy people. And everything in this home
 is in your name. He will never let you get out
of their hands. Second thing, Salman. You will not cause Salman any 
form of financial loss and also, I am doing this for Salman
and not you, because he really respects you. I hope you will stay true to this or else I have all the proof with me. What had to happen, 
what had to pass, has passed. Now you don’t need to drag me 
in my past, aunt Mehreen. Aunty? You called me aunty? Yes, I did. And I will call you the same 
in future as well. All of you. Especially you. You ruined my life. To save your life, you took away 
my entire childhood. Salman. 
Stay away. Go away from me. There is no need for you to come
in front of me in future. Salman. You have found your daughter, save these emotions for her. You still haven’t slept? You too still haven’t slept. I was working. You went to convince Salman? That’s how it happens. When someone loves another, they try to convince them. He surely wouldn’t have agreed. He is really stubborn. When one thing gets 
stuck in his mind, it is not possible to convince him. Are you consoling yourself or me, by telling me about 
Salman’s temperament? Both of us. Love is both our pain. Salman will understand soon. We will have to make him 
understand, mama. But if uncle and aunt let him think
something else, then. Now, it is enough. I will have to do something. What if, they distance us 
completely from Salman. She still hasn’t served breakfast.
Wasai. Wasai. Coming madam. You still haven’t served breakfast? Elder madam… When mama comes, 
we will have breakfast. What is this nonsense? For so long, 
we have had to wait for Mehreen. Wasai, you serve breakfast. Salman, son, come on 
let’s have breakfast. You are here, you are important. 
After that there is no need for anyone. Leave it, dad. I will go to the office and have it. Mama. Come on, lets both of us go 
and have breakfast. Younger madam, 
your guests have come. I have asked them 
to come inside. They are not my guests. They are uncle’s guests. Aunt, meet her, she too is my aunt.
