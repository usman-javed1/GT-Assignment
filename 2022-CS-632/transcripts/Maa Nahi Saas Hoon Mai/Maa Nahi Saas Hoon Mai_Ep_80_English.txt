Aunt? I just randomly got
a question in my mind. Why do you get so
uncomfortable when you see... the love between Salman
and his Mom? Now look, the love between a son
and his mother is like that but what do you know, you don’t have any child. It looks like you want to say something. I don’t want to say anything. Really? Then I guess you want to ask something. I don’t want to ask
anything from you. okay then let me ask. Aunt Mehreen didn’t have a child, so you adopted a child and
gave it to her. But you didn’t do that, why? Though you are childless too. What you did was good. It is fine until now but it won’t be fine for very long. Hey, at least tell me what happened. Arooj has heard everything
we were talking about. This was the reason
I used to tell you to not talk about this over
and over again. This is not the time to
get angry at me. For now tell me,
what should we do next? What trouble have
you gotten me into? Arooj shouldn’t find out
anything else, and the thing that has gotten
into her knowledge, she will have to stay silent on
what is it and why is it. What if she insists on knowing? Just keep on ignoring it
no matter what happens. And what if she asks Salman? You will restrict Arooj
from asking Salman, no matter what happens, it is your responsibility. Do you care about anything? It has been an entire day and Arooj hasn’t come home yet. Sister in law, what is there to
get so worried about? She might have gone
to her Mom’s house. Yes, that is possible but what if this is not the case? Sister in law, what can I do then? She is not a kid. I wish you were
a mother of a daughter, you would have
understood it well. Mother of a daughter? You are not a mother, in fact you are not a mother at all, I have still given birth to Salman, so please, sister-in-law, please don’t give me a lecture
to understand this pain. You haven’t gone to
the office yet? You didn’t even come
to the breakfast table. I am very scared, Shaista. The work didn’t get done and then there is also danger on my head. Did that shooter get caught? No, he didn’t get caught, but we can get the news anytime, police is raiding at places. But you gave him money and asked him to run
away from here. Yes, I did but he
couldn’t run away. DIG has put a curfew
in the whole city. oh my God, so now what will happen? We might get exposed. Anything can happen. I wish he doesn’t get caught
and if he does, I just hope he gets killed in
a police encounter else he will take my name, and I will have to suffer
in prison all my life, I don’t want that. I am going to the office. This business, property, and wealth, I am the owner of all of it and I have got to know this very well. So I suggest you stop dreaming about it, it will just take me
a visit to the court, the plan you made for 25 years, and I will destroy it in minutes. So the result of everything I said is that stay away
from my husband,... my mother, and
my daughter’s life, it will be better for you. Areej, this is my Areej, my little, my love Areej. Okay, okay. Baby, oh baby. you have taken
a good decision, Salman. What decision, Mom? That you gave Areej to me. I really like playing with her. Mom, it wasn’t my decision but Arooj’s. She gave Areej to you
without even asking me. Okay, whoever’s decision it was, but I get happy. Should I tell you something? Areej looks at me with
so much concentration. Everything she does
gets to my heart. Mom, tell me something. Hmm? Did you like the name
Areej more or Dad? I or Waqar? Who liked this name? But why it was there, I don’t remember anything, Salman. I don’t know who we named Areej. That means, there was someone named Areej. Now who was it, you don’t remember that. Here is Areej, your daughter, her name is Areej, right? Areej my love. That means you don’t know any Areej
apart from this one? I don’t know if I know or not but yes, I feel that I have heard this
name somewhere. And the Areej that
I visualize is exactly like her, very little and lovely Areej. This is my Areej. Wasai, don’t you have
power in your hands? Massage it hard, my head hurts so bad. Madam, it will hurt, you overthink a lot. Though nothing will happen
by all this overthinking. What do you mean? I mean that, only what God wants, will happen. May God forgive, my grandma used to say that it is foolishness to be adamant
on what’s wrong, not bravery. What are you trying to say? Yeah? What will I say? I just want to say that if there is a chance, just save your life and run away. For now, you must
run away from here. My brain is already messed up, don’t push it. You are very clever, you always used to be with Arooj, show her love, you didn’t burn that picture
despite me asking you to, you kept it with you instead so you can show it to Arooj? Yeah? You should be ashamed. You are such a big traitor, get out of my sight. And yes, if I even see you near Arooj, you will always remember
what I do to you. Go away. Your brain will mess up, a person reaps what they sow. What are you thinking? You are still standing on my head. Go away from here. Okay madam. You haven’t gone to
the office yet? You didn’t even come
to the breakfast table. I am very scared, Shaista. The work didn’t get done and then there is also danger on my head. Did that shooter get caught? No, he didn’t get caught, but we can get the news anytime, police is raiding at places. But you gave him money and asked him to run
away from here. Yes, I did but he couldn’t run away. DIG has put a curfew
in the whole city. oh my God, so now what will happen? We might get exposed. Anything can happen. I wish he doesn’t get caught and if he does, I just hope he gets killed
in a police encounter else he will take my name, and I will have to suffer
in prison all my life, I don’t want that. Aunt? I just randomly got
a question in my mind. Why do you get so
uncomfortable when you see ... ...the love between Salman
and his Mom? Now look, the love between a son and
his mother is like that but what do you know, you don’t have any child. It looks like you want
to say something. I don’t want to say anything. okay then let me ask. Aunt Mehreen didn’t have a child, so you adopted a child
and gave it to her. But you didn’t do that, why? Though you are childless too. Aunt? Why have you come here? Just like that. I got a thought so I thought
of sharing it with you. Really? What thoughts did you get now? Aunt, Salman got shot, so ethically we should have
informed her mother, the same mother, the far relative, the one whom you
adopted Salman from. That is what you told me, right? Remember? What is this time to talk
about this? Hey this is the right time
to talk about this. In fact, I feel we have been quite late
to inform his mother. You have come here to talk about
these nonsensical things? These are not nonsensical things. Oh, sorry sorry sorry, now I understand, Salman shouldn’t find out that he is not Aunt Mehreen’s son because if Salman’s actual mother finds
out that Salman was shot, poor woman will come crying
here to hug her son and if that happens, your entire plan will be flopped.
