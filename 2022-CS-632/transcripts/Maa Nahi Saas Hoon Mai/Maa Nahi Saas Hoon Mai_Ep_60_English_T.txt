[70.48] Where were you, Salman?
[76.88] You didn’t attend my call and
 neither did you call me back.
[83.48] You know,
 I get worried like this.
[88.76] I am fine.
[91.52] Thank God my Salman is fine.
[100.76] It is good
[102.24] that you too off the burden 
named Arooj of your head.
[105.96] Arooj is not a burden.
[113.04] And hear the news you were 
restless to hear, hear it out.
[117.56] I am not leaving Arooj.
[120.92] Why?
[125.76] It was your decision.
[130.36] You didn’t want to live 
your life with her.
[132.12] She is not worthy 
of being your wife.
[133.84] Why should I punish Arooj 
for being my wife?
[139.76] I am the one who dragged 
her out of this home,
[141.40] then how can I ask her 
where she spent the night?
[148.48] And she was at Shanzay’s home.
[150.52] How do I believe this?
[152.04] It is possible she was
 lying to both of us.
[154.76] Even if it is a lie,
[158.04] still I am ready to accept 
it as the truth.
[185.20] I don’t know what sort of 
magic does this Arooj do.
[188.96] Salman says one thing and 
comes back doing another.
[193.40] Anyway,
[195.96] Salman has still come alone.
[199.72] Things are still under my control.
[203.28] I will see.
[205.64] I will see.
[232.36] So finally brother Salman’s 
misunderstanding got removed.
[238.32] This is the biggest flaw of love is
[242.60] that it is easily misled.
[245.00] Meaning, you want to say that
[247.00] brother Salman really loves you,
[252.56] and he finds an issue 
daily because of this.
[257.04] Salman is not like that.
[260.76] An issue is made and put in his ears,
[263.68] and then he says what he hears.
[267.72] Anyway,
[269.36] the more I bad mouth brother Salman,
[271.04] the more you will defend him.
[278.12] We will end this exercise here.
[279.72] Tell me,
[281.12] what is the plan?
[285.32] I just have one plan
[292.24] and that is,
[295.04] I have to find my parents at all cost.
[298.88] But how will we do all this?
[305.20] We couldn’t get any record 
from the police station.
[315.36] But,
[318.00] there is still one service that is left.
[321.20] What service?
[324.60] Newspaper.
[332.88] We will go to the library
[334.40] and take out all the old newspapers,
[336.96] and I am sure all the old 
newspapers will be there.
[341.96] Actually, Arooj, you are right.
[344.12] You are right.
[346.68] We should go.
[351.40] Okay, have tea.
[352.88] Okay.
[367.48] I am really sorry, man
[370.60] I don’t know what happens 
to me and then
[373.48] everything gets ruined.
[380.80] This is my fault.
[383.44] I admit it.
[386.60] Right now,
[391.04] I want to stay here with my parents.
[396.16] But, why?
[400.56] I have to search for my parents.
[406.00] Going to that home,
 I get lost in myself,
[409.60] then how will I be able
 to find anyone else?
[412.56] So, I will help you find them.
[415.36] I am with you.
[460.24] Arooj is not a burden.
[465.64] And hear the news you were
 restless to hear, hear it out.
[470.24] I am not leaving Arooj.
[472.08] Why?
[474.00] It was your decision.
[476.96] You didn’t want to live
 your life with her.
[478.64] She is not worthy 
of being your wife.
[480.40] Why should I punish 
Arooj for being my wife?
[484.64] I am the one who dragged 
her out of this home,
[486.48] then how can I ask her 
where she spent the night?
[492.00] And she was at 
Shanzay’s home.
[494.04] How do I believe this?
[495.68] It is possible she was 
lying to both of us.
[498.48] Even if it is a lie,
[501.60] still I am ready to 
accept it as the truth.
[508.88] I have had enough.
[514.04] My son, Salman
[519.52] answer me straight to my face,
[531.44] instead of listening to me, 
he gives me justifications,
[542.16] that too for the sake, of a person
[550.60] who has no importance 
of this home in her heart.
[557.84] Such a girl,
[562.80] who has come in between
 my son and I.
[573.32] I will make sure Salman 
gets rid of this Arooj, today.
[586.96] What does this Arooj 
think of himself?
[593.04] My Salman is mine.
[603.48] Only mine.
[610.24] Elder madam.
[617.12] Elder madam.
[619.32] Yes? Go ahead!
[621.60] You had called me.
[624.24] Yes,
[625.40] as soon as Mr. Salman comes,
[627.12] tell him to meet me.
[628.32] And tell him
[629.76] that I have said he should
 come meet me immediately.
[634.88] Is everything fine?
[637.04] Are you feeling okay?
[639.68] I am fine! Leave.
[643.28] Sure.
[794.36] What is the point of 
getting worried now?
[801.12] Arooj’s fear has escalated
 this to this point.
[809.44] If she had told us earlier,
[812.24] then the situation 
wouldn’t have been so bad.
[818.20] This was not Arooj’s fear,
 it was mine.
[825.80] I had told her that
[828.32] no one in her in-laws should find out.
[833.04] Look Naseema,
[835.28] no matter how much
 you dislike a news,
[838.92] if it is true, it makes its way.
[848.68] This reality of Arooj had to be revealed.
[863.40] I don’t know
[867.08] if Arooj’s relation will be 
able to stay safe or not?
[875.56] The truth has been revealed Naseema.
[884.76] God supports the truth.
[927.16] Arooj, please believe me.
[931.68] In future, no excuse or action
[936.56] will not force me to 
take such decisions.
[944.20] You can stay for as
 long as you want.
[949.44] But when you think of me,
[954.68] then come.
[960.64] I will wait for you.
[971.72] Take care of yourself.
[978.12] You people have given
 me the strength ...
[980.32] ...to keep my head raised
 in front of Salman.
[983.64] Child, we didn’t do 
anything great.
[987.00] Parents never let their 
children bow their head.
[993.76] One more thing,
[997.20] parents are not just the 
ones who give birth,
[1002.84] the parents who bring you 
up also have a high stature.
[1011.80] You continue your attempts.
[1016.20] I pray
[1019.76] that you find the mother 
who gave birth to you.
[1024.12] We will be happy.
[1031.12] and yes, one more thing.
[1034.96] Only the one who has the
 desire to win, wins.
[1056.44] Where do I find myself.
[1063.24] I am unable to find anything.
[1069.84] Not in the police station, 
nor in the library.
[1077.96] How do I find myself?
[1084.80] Where do I look for my parents?
[1089.56] Oh God, help me.
[1150.48] Greetings mama
[1153.64] Greetings.
[1156.20] I had a call made to you to come early.
[1160.44] Yes, I was in a meeting.
[1165.72] Son, Salman,
[1167.48] you have changed a lot.
[1170.36] Earlier you used to come 
running on one call from me,
[1174.20] now you even ignore my orders.
[1178.60] There is nothing like that, mama.
[1182.52] That’s how it is you know. Anyway,
[1184.36] you leave this, tell me,
[1186.04] where is your so called wife Arooj.
[1191.48] I had told you,
[1193.44] she is at her parents home.
[1195.40] But she should be here where you are.
[1201.88] You have no importance in her eyes.
[1207.92] And how did you get to this conclusion,
[1211.28] and why did you take it out,
[1213.72] when I had told you,
[1215.00] that I gave Arooj permission
[1216.36] to stay at her parents home 
for as long as she wants.
[1220.40] Salman, my love,
[1223.08] you are the star of my eyes,
[1226.60] I am your mother.
[1229.20] I understand your pain.
[1233.24] And I know this well that
[1236.24] despite you asking her,
[1239.28] Arooj must have said no to coming.
[1243.72] There is nothing like that, mama.
[1245.00] You have a misunderstanding.
[1247.76] Misunderstanding?
[1249.00] Fine, then,
[1250.64] call her.
[1251.64] We will see
[1252.92] how much importance 
you have in her eyes.
[1254.48] Call her, ring her on her 
phone. Come on.
[1273.36] Salman.
[1282.68] Salman, where were you?
[1284.28] You had said you would 
come pick me up.
[1285.64] You forgot as always.
[1292.80] Yes, I was…
[1294.80] you did good that you came.
[1297.16] Someone else is also present here.
[1308.32] Do you have the manners to greet?
[1313.24] Greetings aunty.
[1331.08] Arooj, thank you so much you came,
[1334.48] or else mama…
[1403.48] You made a really good 
decision, Arooj.
[1415.80] The biggest shelter for a woman
[1418.88] is her home, child.
[1424.16] Yes, aunt.
[1428.00] And I consider this home my shelter
[1436.76] but maybe
[1439.60] aunt Mehreen is not ready to 
tolerate me in this home.
[1445.56] What do I say about Mehreen?
[1448.68] She has never let anyone stay 
in this home peacefully.
[1459.36] By the way, what 
does she say now?
[1463.44] She has Salman standing 
in a court room
[1467.32] and she is comparing her
 love and my love.
[1476.56] You think yourself, aunt,
[1480.16] how difficult would all this 
be for a son.
[1486.36] and mothers with a lot of interest
[1488.68] make their sons go through
 this difficulty.
[1502.36] Where is Salman now?
[1508.16] He is in aunt’s room.
[1511.72] The same thing must be 
happening again.
[1562.00] She left her phone. Aunt.
[1571.72] Salman, where were you?
[1573.12] You had said you would 
come pick you up.
[1574.68] You forgot as always.
[1578.84] Yes, I was…
[1580.64] you did good that you came.
[1585.12] Arooj and Salman were 
not in contact.
[1608.16] Salman didn’t know when 
Arooj had to come.
[1619.04] This is also Arooj’s game.
[1627.04] Salman has left Arooj
[1636.84] but this Arooj
[1644.24] is acting of having good relations 
with Salman to degrade me.
[1654.88] Salman is naïve.
[1661.12] He is acting along with Arooj.
[1670.96] Anyway, no issue.
[1675.96] I have the drop scene 
for this drama.
[1697.24] Elder sir, your tea.
[1699.44] ok
[1701.16] Wasai, my green shirt is 
kept inside, iron it.
[1704.48] Sure.
[1716.92] What happened Shaista?
[1724.56] For how long?
[1725.92] How long will Mehreen
[1727.04] hide behind her mental health
[1729.44] and make the life of both
 these children hell?
[1732.32] How long?
[1739.40] At times I want to tell her
 the whole reality.
[1750.36] I don’t care and have no 
mercy and tell her
[1753.52] that Salman is not your son,
[1756.04] Arooj is not your daughter in law.
[1774.00] That’s why,
[1774.84] she should stop this injustice.
[1777.32] You will not do anything like that.
[1783.68] The biggest lie of Mehreen’s
 life has saved her life.
[1793.64] How long will we hide this truth?
[1796.24] Huh?
[1797.32] And how long will we hide it for?
[1799.04] One day everyone will find out,
[1801.52] and also Mehreen.
[1803.96] Take it easy, Shaista,
[1806.52] when has she done this 
for the first time?
[1807.76] She always does this.
[1823.48] What are you doing here?
[1833.48] Elder sir asked me to
 iron his shirt.
[1838.48] Yes, you took it, right?
 Go iron it. Go.
[1840.60] Sure.
[1884.40] Wasai.
[1885.76] Wasai, wait.
[1887.80] Listen to me.
[1890.48] Yes, younger madam?
[1907.12] I have heard everything.
[1910.96] What did you hear?
[1914.76] That Salman is not 
aunt Mehreen’s son.
[1921.20] Now, I…
[1924.44] I also want to hear it from you.
[1934.36] What you have heard is correct.
[1948.56] What is this, Wasai?
[1951.04] And how?
[1952.96] I can only tell you what 
you have found out.
[1967.44] A long time ago,
[1969.56] elder madam had an accident.
[1979.92] She got a head injury
[1983.16] and she forgot everything.
[1991.56] When she regained consciousness,
[1994.48] then she started calling
 little master her son.
[2006.72] That’s it.
[2008.32] For the sake of her life,
[2011.04] everyone believed this 
lie to be the truth.
[2018.24] and who all knows this is a lie?
[2021.28] Elder sir,
[2023.60] madam,
[2026.36] me.
[2034.52] And now you.
[2054.60] and Salman?
[2058.80] Does he know,
[2068.08] that he is not aunt 
Mehreen’s son?
[2074.48] No.
[2155.08] I don’t care and have no 
mercy and tell her
[2158.08] that Salman is not your son,
[2160.48] Arooj is not your daughter in law.
[2162.56] You will not do anything like that.
[2164.92] The biggest lie of Mehreen’s
 life has saved her life.
[2169.36] How long will we hide this truth?
[2171.88] Huh?
[2172.92] And how long will we hide it for?
[2174.76] One day everyone will find out,
[2177.20] and also Mehreen.
[2179.56] Take it easy, Shiasta,
[2182.20] when has she done this 
for the first time?
[2183.52] She always does this.
[2195.60] A long time ago,
[2197.76] elder madam had an accident.
[2201.24] She got a head injury
[2204.44] and she forgot everything.
[2211.24] When she regained 
consciousness,
[2214.12] then she started calling
 little master her son.
[2223.44] That’s it.
[2224.96] For the sake of her life,
[2227.76] everyone believed this 
lie to be the truth.
[2238.40] What is all this, my God?
[2247.40] You brought two similar 
people at one place.
[2262.36] Salman too is living a life like mine.
[2276.24] How is it possible, that,
[2286.00] Salman is not aunt Mehreen’s son?
[2299.60] Although, aunty loves him a lot.
[2309.80] What is this story?
[2316.68] I will have to find out.
