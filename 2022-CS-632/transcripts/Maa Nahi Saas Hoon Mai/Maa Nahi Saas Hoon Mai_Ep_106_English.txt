What did you do? What else could I do? You were saying 
you would divorce her? Yes, absolutely. After what she has done, 
she deserves to be divorced. You shouldn't do anything like that. You do one thing, have a chip installed in me and then
 keep the remote control for it with you. Then whatever you say, 
however you say, I will do it. Then I will not have any 
thinking of my own. Salman, don't forget, everything
 still belongs to Arooj. Arooj leaving your life means 
you have lost everything. I don't care about that. But, I will take such revenge 
for the slap, that the echo of it, won't let her
sleep at night. At times, you need to take
two steps back to win the war. This is called strategy 
and not defeat, son. Think. We are leaving. But, don't think that we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people. Mama... But... I will come back, and I will surely come back. This is my promise to all of you. I don't know what would be 
happening there. They are really cruel people. Arooj shouldn't have gone there, those people will become 
more violent. We shouldn't have let her go alone. We didn't find out. 
She left in a moment. Did you call her? Yes, I did, but her number is off. God have mercy. Arooj. Areej. Arooj, how did you bring Areej with you? How did those people give
 Areej to you? How could they not give her? A mother went to bring 
her daughter. Here, give her to me. Not right now. She slept with difficulty. What did those people say? Tell us something. What would they say? The people who should talk to us
lowering their gaze, if those same people try to raise 
their eyes and try to talk, then you should wait for the bad 
times of those people. Child, you shouldn't have argued
 with Salman. Why? I want to see you settled 
in your home, child. So, Salman's parents should 
also think this. We are the parents of the girl, we will have to bow down. We will surely have to bow down.
Surely. But not so much that we cut our necks and
keep it in their feet. He had pushed you, right?
Huh? I have settled the score 
for that push. What did you do, Arooj? What did you do? I have taught him a lesson. I have responded to the push 
with a slap. You did bad. You did really bad. Arooj, take Areej inside. Arooj. If you feel that my decision to leave home 
was wrong, then we will go back home. No, I am standing with you 
in your decision. Now we will see whatever happens. Is everything okay? Why are you walking like this? I am fine. I am fine. Where did you go? I went to meet Salman. To meet Salman? Why? To talk about your issue. I told him to save his home 
from being ruined. Then? Then what did he say? He cursed me. And he pushed me down. What has happened to you Salman? You were never like this. Why are you doing this? Why? I didn’t bring you up like this. You pushed my father? Huh? You pushed him? Push me. Hit me. Why don’t you hit me? What do you think of yourself? What is this arrogance for? Respect. Fame. Why are you quiet? 
Speak up. Lower your voice. This is my home, you are not allowed to talk
loudly here. I will talk loudly. And what is this home 
you are talking about? Two minutes. The ground from under your feet 
will be pulled in two minutes. Areej. Areej. You cannot take Areej. You cannot keep a daughter away 
from her mother. I will stop you.
Leave me. Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it. Leave it… She raised her hand at Salman Sir Salman. Why did you come here? Sir Salman, are you feeling okay? Go from here. Leave! If you take Areej from here,
then I will kill you. You will kill me? Kill me. Kill me. Shoot. Why don’t you shoot?
Murder me. Tell Areej that a mother sacrificed 
her life for her daughter. Shoot. Come on, shoot. Hey, leave it. 
Coward. How will you shoot someone? It will cost you a lot to take Areej. I am not a businessperson 
like you people, that I will account for cheap 
and expensive. I am a mother. If you take Areej from here, you will have to face a lot of loss. I will divorce you. You can do what you want. After what she has done, 
she deserves to be divorced. You shouldn't do anything like that. You do one thing, have a chip installed in me and then 
keep the remote control for it with you. Then whatever you say, 
however you say, I will do it. Then I will not have any thinking 
of my own. Salman, don't forget, everything still belongs to Arooj. Arooj leaving your life means
you have lost everything. I don't care about that. But, I will take such revenge 
for the slap, that the echo of it, won't let her 
sleep at night. At times, you need to take two 
steps back to win the war. My name is Salman. I have never learned 
to accept defeat, nor have I learned to lose. Arooj, what do you think? 
You won and I lost? No. You are mistaken. I will take revenge for this slap, and I will take it with a profit. Then you will not find 
a place to hide. Nowhere. I am really worried for you, child. Why are you worried, papa? Child, the people you have 
stood up against, they are really influential and 
powerful in every way. I have only spoken for my right, papa. What else have I done? See, those people dragged you 
out of your own home. Yes, so you didn’t let me 
take the help of law, or those people wouldn’t have been
able to drag me out of there. Help from the law? Your home will get ruined, child. Can we not make a truce 
with those people? Truce? Okay, tell me, how can we make a truce? By agreeing to Salman. Do you know what he wants? He wants that this property and
business is put in his name. Then do this. Do what he wants. After all, he is your husband. Yes, so, Salman should also 
think the same thing. After all, I am his wife too, if it is with me or with him, 
it is the same thing. You have taken a big step,
slapping Salman. I am afraid that Salman 
will do something that will not be in your favour. Papa, whatever happened 
is in front of you. I don’t understand what 
you are trying to say. If I say it, you won’t agree. Go ahead. You apologize to Salman. Apologize? What have I done that 
I apologize for it? What is my fault? Child, you be the bigger person. May God save your home. You went to him. Did you not see his behaviour? I still haven’t lost hope. Salman is emotional. 
That’s it. I want to make my final attempt. Maybe, I will be able to change
 Salman’s heart. Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t pass from the police station. I will try my best to save my home. Even after so much happened? Only for the sake of my daughter. I think the same. You have reduced the burden on 
my heart by saying this. Okay Naseema, I am going 
for some work. I will come back soon. 
Suddenly? What work did you remember?
Where are you going? Hey, you have started to ask 
too many questions. Where are you going? 
When will you come back? So, it is important to ask. You go anywhere, 
without informing. Here, there is a reason for me 
going anywhere. Understand? Look, you are not well, that is why inform us and 
go where you are going. I will tell you every single word 
when I come back, but right now it is better that 
you don’t drive me mad. He consults himself, he didn’t even tell me. I don’t know
what he is planning. It is up to him, 
he shouldn’t tell me. What happened, mama? 
Who are you getting upset at? Your Father. He thinks himself and then starts implementing it. What happened? He didn’t tell me and he left. He left? 
Where did he go? Yes, he went. 
I asked him, he said that I will tell you 
when I come back. You know papa doesn’t lie. What is the meaning of saying
this right now, Arooj? I mean that the place 
papa has gone to, he doesn’t want to tell you about it. That’s why he said I will come back
and tell you. This means, you know where, 
Master went. Yes, I know where he went and he shouldn’t have 
gone there at all. Will you give me some money? Yes, why not? I will come. 
Now, where are you going? I will come back and tell you. You take care of Areej. Hey, what? Where are you going? 
At least tell me and go. What is the issue?
Both of them are going. Why is no one telling me anything?
