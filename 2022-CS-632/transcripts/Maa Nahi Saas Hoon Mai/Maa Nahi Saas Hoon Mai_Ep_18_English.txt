Come on, bring it. Today you didn’t even eat food and you are also quiet since evening. What happened? My heart is really worried. I miss Urooj again and again. These are two things. If your heart is worried,
then take some medicine and if you miss Urooj,
then call her. Why do I feel Urooj is worried? God forbid, Naseema. Urooj is happy with her in-laws. Now there is just one cure
for your imagination, call her. She is not even answering my call. My heart is really worried. Hey, she must be busy somewhere. You mothers immediately
worry for your daughters. Who is this teddy bear for, Alizay? I had brought it for Urooj, but the doctor’s reports
broke all my dreams. The happiness of you, Salman and
mine have been ruined completely. That’s how it is, Alizay. You too had brought a lot of toys. Do one thing, keep this teddy bear
with those toys. You know, had I known that Urooj cannot
become a mother, then at least I wouldn’t have wasted
my time and money on this girl. Everything went to waste. Wasai. Wasai, pick up all the toys and remove these pictures too. Yes, elder madam. Why are you removing these toys? What has happened? When you cannot have a child, then look at these toys. They look so inappropriate
in your room, like binoculars in the
hands of a blind man. Yes, but don’t get
the toys removed. I will distance everything
from this home, that has snatched the happiness of
becoming a grandmother from me. Wasai, pick up all these toys and throw
them in the store room. yes... Man, Salman, what is this? I have come to spend
some good time with you, and you are standing here sad. I don’t understand anything. What happened?
Some business problem? Life itself is a business. Please don’t increase my worries
by saying these difficult things. What is the issue? Man, tell me, do you have any knowledge
of adopting a child? Oh, so this is your worry. Answer what I am asking you. I think you will need
detailed information. Exactly, I need all legal information. I will ask you why you
need it the day I give you complete information. Yes, Urooj, go ahead. Salman, I have to go to mama’s home. Yes, then fine, you go. Tell me, is the car at home or should
I send it from the office? No, no, the car is at home. I just needed your permission. You don’t need my permission, you can go. I know you never say no. I just like seeking your permission. Goodbye. Are you going somewhere, Urooj? Why? Is it necessary to tell you? You look really worried, Urooj.
What happened? By the way, why are you interested
in my worry? Salman is my friend and you are his wife. I will have interest. Hmmm. If your unimportant questions
are done, then can I go? Are you going to a shrine? Why? To pray, Urooj. See, now a miracle can
save your case, right? Medical science has
said no to your case. I have full faith in my God, and He is way ahead
of medical science. I am really disappointed
with aunt’s behaviour. I mean, she threw
away all the toys. That is so wrong. You must be really hurt, right? God is really merciful. You will see, these toys will come
back to my room again. Hey, you can even get
them right now, Urooj. But where will you get someone
who will play with them? My heart was really worried. I mentioned it your father, he called it my superstition
and made me get quiet. Urooj, you are crying? What happened my daughter? Come sit here. Come. Tell me, what has happened? Sit down. Urooj, my heart is really worried. Child, tell me, what happened? Mama. Mama, your daughter
cannot be a mother. What? Who is saying this? Who said this? According to the reports,
that’s how it is. What will happen
now, mama? Nothing will happen, and you don’t worry at all. How do I not worry? I cannot give Salman a child, this must be a big sorrow for him. Look child, at times such reports
give wrong results. No mama, I saw the report myself,
it was stated in it. I don’t believe it, and I will take you to
the doctor myself. You will see, everything will be fine. What is the matter, child? Are you worried? I am really depressed. First cause of Alizay, and
now my medical problem. So there is nothing to
worry in this, child? If you get depressed like this, the complications will increase. The complications will increase? I don’t understand Come here, I will explain it to you. The thing is child… see child, to be a mother, you also need to have mental health along with physical health. But I cannot become a mother. Urooj, life hasn’t come to a
stand still on a report. And neither is this the last doctor. Don’t be disappointed. You will see, you will surely be a mother. First, you get out
of this depression. What do I do, aunt? How do I get myself out
of this depression? I don’t understand anything. I myself want to get out
of this depression. Child, breath in open air, laugh, talk, if you are in a good mood, and you live your life, then you will give a place to
some existence in yourself. You are right. You know, aunt, what you say really
gives me courage. Don’t be disappointed
from God, child. God delays but He doesn’t refuse. Salman. Sit with me some time. Spend some time with me. I am your friend. I know, Alizay. I am really sorry, I am
unable to give you time, but what can I do? I am really busy. Hmmm. You will be busy, you are a businessman. But you seem
a little worried to me. Salman, I can understand
your condition in your silence. What do you mean? What is my condition and
what can you understand? Salman, look, I know that everyone wishes to be a father. After that they consider
themselves complete. Alizay, I don’t feel this way. Salman, if this wish of yours doesn’t
get complete for a long time, what will you say to the world? Will you show Urooj’s
reports as proof? What will you do? Alizay, what do you
want to say? Salman, I am worried for you as a friend.
I worry for you. Tell me something. Aren’t you being a little
too personal? I had said something as a friend. Sorry. You are here. How was your day today? It was good. Why are you looking at me like that? I am seeing you smile
after a long time, I like it. Urooj, you don’t get depressed. Hmm. I am trying. But Salman,
what type of life is this? You are always busy in
your business and I am stuck in this worry. So what do I do? The pressure of business is a lot. Okay, you get fresh, I will get tea for you. Okay Urooj. Yes? I had to tell you that I have to go out of country
this week for a meeting. Suddenly? No, the plan was for next month, but I have to meet the client this week, so I will have to go. You will leave me alone and go, Salman. I need you right now. How will I live alone? Don’t worry. I will do one thing, I will drop you at your mama’s place. You stay there for a few days, and spend time with her too. Hmmm? Fine. I will get fresh and come. Hello. How are you Shanzay? I am absolutely fine, you tell me,
how are you? I am fine too. You know, I have good news for you. What is that? I am getting rid of that
Alizay for a week. Tell me how all this happened
without any hurdles. Actually. Actually, Salman is going
abroad for a week. He just told me and he was saying he would drop me
at mama’s home for that time. Oh great. Amazing. Go, go to your mom’s home,
make them care for you. Yes, and it is possible that this forced guest we have at our home will leave not finding Salman here. Oh, wow. Meaning, two rides in one ticket. Okay listen, when you go to your mom’s, call me. I will also visit there. Then both sisters will
sit and talk freely. Yes, yes, I will surely call
you when I get there. Okay, I will talk later. Right now, I have to go
make tea for Salman, he has gone to get fresh. Okay fine, take care of yourself. Bye. Hey, my daughter Urooj. You look really happy today. Yes, Salman is going
abroad for ten days, so he was saying he would
drop me at mom’s home. That’s really good. But your mother-in-law shouldn’t
find out about this plan. But Salman was saying
he will inform aunt. Oh no. Okay. Anyway, now go in God’s protection. Urooj is playing really smart. Now she will leave like this, and I will keep on looking. Salman abroad, and Urooj will be at her parents’ home. This is my insult. Where is aunt Mehreen? Where is she? You have to take care of everything next, come quickly. Alizay, what is this bag for? Where are you going? I…I was thinking that I will stay at a hotel near the airport, then I will take the next available
flight and go back. But why? Because aunt Mehreen, I just found out, that’s why. What did you find out? Look, I came for Salman
here from the US, he is going abroad for some work. It is going that he is going abroad, but why are you doing? Because Salman won’t be here, Urooj too is going to her
parents’ home for ten days. What will I do here?
I will get bored. It is better that I leave. How can she go? And I don’t know about it? I don’t know. You don’t know. Anyway, you are not
going anywhere. Go keep your bag and I will talk to this Urooj. How can she go anywhere
without my permission? She didn’t even tell me. How will you leave like that? My name is Alizay, and you are still a child, Urooj. Urooj, I am going to the
office for two hours, you complete my packing. Did you inform aunt that I will go to mama’s
home after you leave. I will tell her when
the right time comes. Okay, I will drop you at your mom’s
on the way to the airport. Okay? But Salman… Don’t worry, I will take care of everything. without informing me, without taking permission from me? How can you go to drop
Urooj to her parent’s home All this is your plan, right? mama, I was going
to tell you, but… Will you not feel ashamed
even a little, Salman? She came from the US for you and this is how you
will treat the guests? Is this how things in
this home, work? You abroad and your wife
at her parent’s home? Mama, that… Quiet! Urooj will not go anywhere. Alizay is here for a long time. Don’t insist Salman. Mama, look, please let Urooj go. Fine, then, if this is what you want, then I will leave this home and go. You do what you want. Mama. Mama. Now what are you staring at me for? Pick it up, keep it. I don’t know, I mistreated Urooj every time,
knowingly or unknowingly. Will you not feel ashamed
even a little, Salman? She came from the US for you and this is how you
will treat the guests? Is this how things in
this home, work? You abroad and your
wife at her parent’s home? Hello. Hello. Yes, Salman, did you reach the office? Yes, I have reached the office. Okay listen, don’t worry. Whatever happened 
today is nothing news. I am used to it, now. But I am disappointed that Alizay’s wish was given preference 
over what we were saying. Okay, I had to tell you, I am not going abroad. The client is coming to 
Pakistan themselves, we will have the 
meeting next week. Really? This is a really good news. Okay, you work and 
don’t worry at all. Goodbye. Goodbye. Urooj is so naïve. Despite all my mistreatment, she doesn’t spoil her mood. Instead she makes 
my mood better. Yes, go ahead. Look at this doctor. What do you want to ask? Doctor, I want to talk to you 
regarding this report. Why do you have any doubts? What do you want to talk about? I want that you get this test done again. Even we know this 
matter is really sensitive, so we are really careful. But doctor, there can be a mistake 
in the test as well. This means you don’t 
trust our test. Okay fine, if you don’t want to do
 the test again, then we will go to another lab. Okay, you wait for some time, let me talk to my senior 
and inform you. Excuse me. Hello. This is Dr. Shazia. Yes, yes, I know. I had told you not to contact me. Mrs. Salman is sitting in 
my room with her mother. Now you tell me, should
 I have called or not? Urooj? What is Urooj doing there? We have declared 
a healthy woman, impotent. So, they had this much right that
 they got worried and came to you. and are you too worried? I am not worried. For me it is enough to
 say to her that she gets the test again. And she will get it done. That’s it. After that, along with Mrs. Salman, 
everyone will find out everything. You are really smart, doctor. What do you mean? Mama, I feel we should have 
taken appointment and come. I think the doctor is busy somewhere. It is a hospital. There are other patients too. And people come here with 
their hopes and worries, child.
