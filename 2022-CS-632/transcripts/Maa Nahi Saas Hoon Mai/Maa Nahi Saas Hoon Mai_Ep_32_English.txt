Mr. Idrees and Mr. Nawaz will be here 
anytime now and these are all the printouts and it also has the details of 
the new project. Good. 
Good? I am the best. Umm by the way, if we praise our boss in this office, it won’t be against the office rules, 
right? By the way, it is against the rules to praise 
your boss and your job can be in danger too. No, no, don't make this mistake, I have to bring Uncle’s doing 
in front of everyone. yes, we actually need to bring that 
in front of everyone, after all we need to know where 
so much money is going. Don’t worry, we will find it out together. Come in. Hey brother Idrees, you? 
Come, have a seat. Did I disturb you? No, sit down, are you done with the meeting? Yes, meeting is done but there is a problem 
that has started. What problem, brother Idrees? There is a problem that pushed me 
to come talk to you here. You are worrying me. I am here to discuss something that I thought who could be better 
to talk apart from you? Is everything okay? What is it? It is nothing appropriate to say 
but what can I do? It is important, I don’t understand where 
to begin it from, I don’t have the words. Talk openly brother Idrees. Actually, it has never happened 
in our family … What has happened, brother Idrees,
you can tell me. Umm your daughter in law Arooj and the new finance office, Ammad, I am trying to say that there is a little 
too much informality between the two that I don’t find right. Do you understand what am I trying to say? Brother Idrees and sister-in-law Shaista 
has always supported Arooj but if now brother Idrees is saying I am sure he must have seen something 
that he is saying it. This is a very sensitive matter, if I accuse Arooj without any proof, something can go wrong, I will have to collect the proofs first, if this turns out to be true then Arooj we will get rid of you, you, who stole my son’s love, 
your exit is confirmed. By the grace of God, 
company growth level is very nice and monthly profit is increasing too. Every year the profit is increasing but… But? But what? 
Why did you stop? Day to day expenses is a lot that are 
being taken from the profit. So, at what point the overheads are more? Overheads are on lunch tea coffee etc. And what is the total expense? Approximately 6 lac rupees. So much? I know, because all the officer’s food comes 
from outside from 5-star hotels. Oh, so then we have to control 
these expenses. Okay make some feasibility and tell me how can we control 
these expenses? Okay I will work on it. Thank you. Boss, the situation is getting bad 
day by day. I am not getting any good news 
from you these days, anyway, tell me, what happened? Madam Arooj has asked for the entire record 
of office canteen. Why? Boss, I don’t know that but 
there is definitely something. There is something new 
every other day. Anyway, well… This well at the end of your sentence
won’t make things well. Things will get well 
they will definitely get well, the trap that I have set this time, 
there will be. You have played a move already? You have started to ask 
a lot of questions. Sorry boss, you were saying something? The situation is not Good, so I have taken the step very careful. Are you sure boss, I am afraid the step doesn’t get 
on the mine. It will, it will but not ours, someone else will step. Your confidence will get us in trouble. the trap that I have set this time, someone else will get into it. Both the cases against us are very strong, take care of it boss. Nothing will happen, the enemy will get into the trouble, 
understand? okay boss. What happened? 
Why are you surprised like this? Who is all this for? For you and your staff. Yes, but you already restricted us. hmmm that was my decision and 
this is my decision too. Wasai, go out and serve tea to everyone 
and get coffee for me. Okay. I am very happy, but why did you change your decision. I felt whatever I did was wrong. After all this is our staff and it is 
our responsibility to take care of them and then I thought that after all this office is also 
my Salman’s. Thank you for taking so much care 
of all the staff. We should also keep an eye on 
the people in our surroundings and we should take care of them too. Carry on with your work. She is a very unpredictable woman. Boss, I forgot to give 
the actual good news. Tell me, tell me, 
hurry up and tell me. Your food won’t come from 
outside from now on. You fool is that a good news? And who has given these orders? Who can? Madam Arooj. So then what will I eat? From the canteen, 
where we all eat from. I will never eat from the canteen, 
I eat diet food. Boss, the food will come from 
the canteen only, you know madam Arooj looks 
after everything related to accounts. I will see her. Is Salman in his room?
Yes. Boss, you will have to eat from 
the canteen only, you have enjoyed enough, now have food from the canteen. Sir I would have never requested you 
if there wasn’t a need. It’s okay, do one thing go to the accountant 
your problem will be solved. Thank you so much sir. Thank you. And you, ask the GM of 
Ahmed Associates to contact me. Uncle, what happened? You could have told me, 
I would have come to you. Please have a seat. 
No, it’s okay. Look Salman I have been a part of this office
 since your dad Waqar Ahmed was alive. Yes. I know that. This office is not the same office anymore. What happened uncle, you look upset. Did I make any mistake? We have restrictions on having 
lunch here as well now that the lunch won’t come 
from outside. But those orders are for everyone
including myself and you. But why is there an attempt to 
change the system of this office? Uncle, we are not attempting 
to change the system in fact, we are trying to fix it. Arooj wants to decrease these 
unnecessary expenses. But the company is doing 
really well Salman and I guess it is not your police 
nor Arooj’s, in fact you just have your signatures
 on those orders, if these orders are not from my end 
or Arooj’s then who is behind these orders? Arooj’s new finance office Ammad, he is trying to be more loyal 
towards the owner. Okay don’t worry, and by the way 
this is company’s issue, why don’t you directly talk 
to Arooj about it? I should talk to Arooj myself? No, never. Madam Arooj, I am emailing you 
the performance report for today. Come on Ammad, don’t call me madam, at least 
when no one is there. there is no need to get free I am your finance manager 
and you are my boss. Hmm, okay, my obedient finance manager, tell me what is the report for today? the report is that there are 
overheads of 6 lacs, and I have emailed the summary 
to Mr. Salman. Why? because he asked me to. So, what do you think? Will Salman make any changes to it? He might because you can answer it better than me 
because you know him more than I do. Yes, you are right but Salman is a bit moody, he might just reject the whole summary. that is possible. Hmm. For your kind information, it’s time for me to leave so I am off now. Okay, you take an off and tomorrow 
let’s see what Salman says. Okay bye. 
Bye. Amna, I have emailed some documents to you I need its printouts in the morning. Okay? And you must take an off and 
ask the staff the same. Thank you. Ammad? Oh oh. He forgot his keys. He won’t change his habits. Ammad? Ammad? Ammad?  Ammad? You are forgetting something. Umm no, no. Uh, sorry. Your habit of forgetting keys didn’t change, you are still the same, do you remember that you used to 
forget the keys in university times as well and I used to take care of them. thanks. And what if you remembered them 
after getting home? What would you do? Would you break all the locks or… Or? Sleep on the stairs. Umm Arooj. 
Yes? Arooj, shall I say something to you? Nothing bye. Bye. Your daughter-in-law Arooj and 
the new financer office, Ammad, I am trying to say that there is a little too much informality 
between the two that I don’t find right. Salman? 
Hmm? Ammad was telling me that 
you asked for overheads’ files. Yes, I wanted to see what have you 
finance departments put restrictions on. Really? So did you find anything that our office did wrong? Arooj the thing is that uncle complaint about you. Complained about me? What did I do? You have restricted lunch from outside? Not just for him but the owner 
of this company too, it means yours too. Look I don’t mind it but… So, then uncle shouldn’t have
 any objection too. I am bearing all my expenses myself so then everyone should. And what should I do about 
uncle being offended? ummm, so then for that let’s do something let’s make a policy there won’t be lunch
for anyone, whoever wants to have lunch can do it 
with their own pocket money, simple. Hmm. What are you thinking? It’s not a bad idea. By the way, if you are interested, I have a plan, 
will you listen? Sure, go ahead. Look, our company has controlled 
expenses worth 6 lacs, if we give all the employees 
an increment of Rs10,000 and ask them to arrange lunch themselves so the staff will get happy that 
we got an increment and the company will still save Rs3 lac, what do you say? Hmm. Brilliant. You are right, our staff will get happy too and…
And uncle too. I hope so. Sir, Madam Sr is calling you. okay, you may go I am coming in a while. Okay. Good idea, I will focus on this. Thank you. yes mom? did you call me? Hmm. Now you don’t come on your own, I have to get you called. No mom, there is nothing like that, actually I came back from office 
so was tired. You tell me, what is it? Salman, tell me this boy that Arooj has hired in her company, do you know him? Yes. How do you like him? he is a nice boy, very talented and hard working. He gets paid for his talent 
and hard work. What happened mom? Tell me if that boy is important 
for the company or for Arooj? What do you mean? 
I didn’t get you. Ammad and Arooj are very informal 
with each other. Mom, they are very old friends, 
they were university fellows. So, shouldn’t the new relationships be 
catered while fulfilling the old ones? Salman, when I say less 
take it as more. I have cooked for Salman myself, go tell him. Wasai, I am asking you,
go call Salman. Madam, Sir is not in his room. Where is Salman? Madam Sr called her in her room. There is a limit, this Mehreen has made Salman’s life 
complicated. They argue in the morning while 
he is leaving for work and also when he comes back from work. Wasai, I am so worried for Salman, there is so much mental pressure 
on my child, and this Mehreen, no one says 
anything to him. Madam, you get so worried for Sir Jr, and why not? After all, you are the mother. Wasai, you have made Salman play in your lap
since he was a baby, right? You know my son is so innocent. And now he has gotten 
in to this confusion. Office, business, wife, and then this Mehreen, my son has been stuck, he is stuck. Go, go do your work. 
Okay. He cannot eat properly 
or have anything. What should I do? Mom, Arooj is his boss, she has her own style of getting work 
from him, that’s it. Yes, that is what I am saying, Arooj is the boss, there is a distance between 
an employee and the boss. Yes, and that’s how it is If that’s how it is then why can’t I see it? 
I see something else. What do you see? Look Salman, I don’t want to see you worried. Mom, I am not worried, 
I have no worries. You are not right now, 
but you will be in the future. Mom, I don’t understand anything 
that you are saying. I just want that you don’t stay busy
in the office but also keep an eye on the matters 
of this office. So, Arooj is looking after this office. You need to keep on eye on her only. 
Mom. Oh wow, so Arooj’s love has pushed you to speak 
in a higher voice in front of your mother as well. Listen to me very carefully Salman, there should be a distance between
a boss and the employee, make Arooj understand well that 
Ammad is the employee of this house, I cannot give you a bigger hint. Mom, please, don’t say anything. You are doubting Arooj’s character, her and Ammad are just friends 
and nothing more than that Salman, I don’t believe in a girl and 
boy’s friendship at all. So then you used to get so happy 
with the friendship I and Alizeh had, you had no objections at all. That is why I wanted to get you 
married to Alizeh, Son. What? She is making my son her defender, I will see her, I will see her. I just want that you don’t stay busy 
in the office but also keep an eye on the matters 
of this office. So Arooj is looking after this office. You need to keep on eye on her only. Mom. oh wow, so Arooj’s love has pushed you to speak 
in a higher voice in front of your mother as well. Listen to me very carefully Salman, there should be a distance between 
a boss and the employee, make Arooj understand well that 
Ammad is the employee of this house, I cannot give you a bigger hint. Mom, please, don’t say anything. Salman, son, you are sitting here in the corner and I have been looking for you 
in the entire house. Aunt, I am so worried. Don’t take whatever Mehreen says 
personally. How not? Everything she says hurts me 
in the heart, she says such hurtful things. You know Mehreen, she doesn’t like Arooj only because you went against 
Mehreen and married Arooj, isn’t that so? Yes, it is. Mehreen wants to get that office closed, she still wants that. So now you tell me what should I do? You solved the problem by bringing
office to home, now? No, I think that problem has gotten bigger than before. I know that. Know what? Look son, I won't repeat myself but I would just say that I can bear anything but I cannot bear anyone being character
assassinated or an accusation. That kills the peace and 
blessings from home. You are absolutely right. I have heard what mom said but I will never believe it. Never. This Mehreen will never let 
the peace be in this home, she looks for excuses to create 
a problem in the house. That’s true what has she done now? She does crack fire crackers and now she has brought 
this new issue. Tell me what did she do? She is saying that Arooj is being 
very frank with Ammad. Oh that’s what she said? By the way she is not wrong, 
I have felt it too. What did you feel? That she defends and 
favors that boy. So how does it prove that 
she is frank with Ammad. Shaista they are, So what’s wrong, they know each other for very long, they are friends with each other. You don’t know, Shaista, But we do know Arooj, 
it is the limit Idrees. Hey you are not looking at it 
like I am. You don’t look at it that way too, if you will look for the truth according 
to your wish, it will be bad.
