[78.44] So, it means you have called Salman.
[83.32] So, my child, why aren’t you telling us
[86.00] why Salman took you out of his home?
[88.96] And why didn’t you call us last night?
[96.80] Is that how someone stays outside
 the home all night?
[121.12] Okay
[123.68] so, she is here.
[137.08] She really likes to stay here
[143.64] and you guys really like making 
her stay here,
[150.36] she will live here from now on
[156.92] because I am leaving her forever 
and ever.
[247.96] Arooj, it’s not what you are thinking,
[251.28] believe me, you are the only girl 
in front of whom I am helpless.
[257.68] What is the reason of being helpless?
[265.96] I love you.
[271.56] I want to marry you.
[276.32] Will you marry me?
[288.00] I like your daughter.
[298.64] I am here with her proposal 
for marriage
[302.60] if you guys don’t have any objection.
[314.60] I have an objection,
[318.28] how dare you even say this?
[322.92] It looks like you are not 
in your senses, Mister.
[326.28] I am in my absolute senses
[329.04] and I know very well 
what I am saying.
[437.16] Salman, son, listen to one thing 
before saying anything.
[444.40] say what you want to say.
[446.84] Son, we have always respected 
your decisions
[451.12] and we will do the same today.
[456.40] Master,
[459.08] do you even know
[461.20] what decision are you talking 
about accepting?
[468.68] To be honest, Naseema,
[470.96] I am not scared of any decision 
that Salman might make now,
[486.64] yes,
[488.36] accepting Arooj was also 
Salman’s decision,
[490.92] in fact, he was adamant.
[497.80] Salman is unable to fulfill what he was 
adamant about at that time
[501.60] so why should we be scared of 
what he is being stubborn about now?
[552.68] Salman is not picking up the call,
[555.36] are you worried or not?
[557.84] There is no need for anyone to be 
worried, sister in law Shaista.
[562.56] this is nothing to be proud of, 
Mehreen,
[568.96] have you heard the word divorce
on our family ever?
[578.12] But Sadly,
[580.24] you guys are getting all this done.
[585.36] No one is getting anything done, 
sister in law Shaista,
[587.80] Salman is free to make his decision.
[590.80] Mehreen is right, Salman is intelligent.
[594.24] I don’t have any doubts on 
Salman’s intellect,
[596.72] my only concern is that he is being 
fooled in the name of love and hate.
[609.44] Are you pointing towards me,
 sister in law?
[612.44] please, please Mehreen,
[615.40] I don't want to get into any 
argument right now,
[619.36] right now I just know that
[622.36] if Salman takes any such step 
his entire life will change.
[628.16] Nothing will change,
[630.72] in fact, it will be like before,
[633.28] an arrogant girl like Arooj won’t be
in Salman’s life.
[656.76] No, I won’t let that happen.
[659.92] Salman, pick up the phone.
[676.52] Salman, son,
[678.36] it is good for a person to 
have authority,
[685.72] but responsibilities also increase 
when you get the authority.
[693.24] I know everything.
[695.24] Just knowing is not enough.
[700.32] it’s very straight, Uncle,
[703.76] Arooj was missing all night
 out of home,
[712.64] and I cannot even think of living 
my life with such a girl.
[716.28] Salman,
[717.60] don’t put any allegation on Arooj.
[720.56] Master, let me talk.
[728.00] Salman,
[730.12] you are the one who took 
Arooj out of the house,
[733.44] she didn’t leave the house 
by her own choice.
[740.00] Arooj is not such a type of girl,
[742.68] you must have known that by far.
[744.80] That is the problem,
[749.16] she doesn’t let me know 
anything about her.
[752.96] My child,
[754.60] you need to give confidence 
to your wife to know her.
[759.52] There is no use in saying 
all this now
[765.56] because Arooj has created a lot 
of distance between herself and I.
[770.12] And it is about my trust now.
[772.48] Had you contacted her friend Shanzey,
[776.24] you wouldn’t be saying this right now.
[830.80] Hello?
[832.04] Arooj, thank God you took my call, 
my child,
[836.36] Salman is not picking up my call.
[839.56] He is with Dad,
[842.72] he is here to tell his decision for 
the sake of comforting his ego.
[848.68] No, no, my child, 
Salman is not like that,
[851.52] it’s Mehreen who is feeding his brain
and heart with hatred.
[854.68] Aunt, Salman is not a kid
[860.48] that someone fed so much 
hatred in his mind
[863.48] that he has no place for me 
in his heart anymore.
[867.28] My child, try to understand
[870.76] that Mehreen is the one 
who controls Salman’s nerves,
[882.00] sometimes in the name of motherhood
and sometimes in sympathy.
[885.96] But I don’t need sympathy, Aunt.
[893.32] I just need Salman who can 
differentiate between right and wrong.
[898.00] You are absolutely correct,
[903.84] just have courage,
[905.80] in fact, make me talk to Salman,
[908.04] I will, I will make him 
understand myself.
[910.96] No Aunt, not at all,
[913.56] if Salman will create his opinion 
on someone’s words,
[917.80] then I don’t need that at all.
[923.20] Okay then,
[926.96] I will talk to Salman myself,
[930.68] but Arooj, my child,
[934.52] if you get a chance to reconcile, 
don’t refuse
[943.00] because the Arooj I know 
wants to reconcile, right?
[954.88] Okay, take care,
[958.80] I will talk to you later.
[1018.96] You know how much I love you, right?
[1026.84] And I won’t let anyone be 
a hindrance in my love.
[1035.40] I won’t let anything happen.
[1098.32] To cut everything short,
[1103.52] whatever sort of complaint you have 
from Arooj, no matter if it is baseless
[1107.76] but even if you are still adamant 
on your decision,
[1111.80] none of us will stop you.
[1119.64] Remember one thing,
[1122.80] it’s not like our Arooj doesn’t have
 anyone on her back.
[1132.52] We won’t leave her alone 
till our last breath.
[1142.24] Uncle, actually, the thing is,
[1148.44] Arooj stays out of home all day 
since the past few weeks.
[1157.88] She stays up all night,
[1160.44] keeps on thinking,
[1165.32] visits police stations, gets in fights
 with someone or the other,
[1173.16] and when I ask her, 
she doesn’t tell me anything,
[1178.68] am I that unimportant?
[1184.04] What is she looking for?
[1189.40] Uncle, I am her life partner
[1193.16] and I am the one unaware 
of everything,
[1198.92] you tell me,
[1201.36] if that how you live a married life?
[1208.36] Where a wife hides things 
from her husband?
[1211.84] I am tired.
[1217.56] Business, mom, home,
[1219.64] I need comfort from all of this,
[1222.20] and Arooj is just increasing 
my discomfort.
[1231.04] I don’t get it why Arooj doesn’t 
share her problems with me.
[1235.56] I will remove this factor that 
is causing you discomfort.
[1242.40] I will share one of Arooj’s issues 
with you,
[1246.76] now let’s see if you support her
after that or not.
[1253.16] What issue?
[1255.36] Master?
[1264.84] Arooj is looking for her parents.
[1274.52] Yes, son.
[1277.04] Arooj is not our biological daughter.
[1295.56] What are you saying, Uncle?
[1298.08] I am right.
[1300.56] Arooj was a few months old 
when I and Naseema found her.
[1324.56] Such a huge thing?
[1327.68] You guys hid such a huge thing 
from me?
[1330.72] You just got worried listening to this,
[1334.68] though Arooj went through this problem.
[1337.60] Just imagine
[1345.56] the mental state Arooj is going through.
[1457.08] Shall we go?
[1467.28] where?
[1471.68] Our home.
[1476.64] I might be able to get rid of the pain 
caused by your dishonesty
[1488.92] but the bruises on my soul 
will take time to heal.
[1504.00] I am really sorry, dude,
[1507.40] I don’t know what happens to me,
[1509.92] and then everything gets ruined.
[1521.24] This is my fault,
[1523.72] I admit it.
[1528.40] Are you embarrassed?
[1543.56] The result of anything said out of anger
 is never good.
[1555.08] For now, I want to stay here 
with my parents.
[1564.48] But why?
[1569.08] I need to find my parents,
[1579.32] get lost in myself in that house
[1583.04] so how will I find anyone else?
[1586.68] So, I will help you in finding them,
[1588.76] I am with you.
[1599.48] I just need one help from you,
[1608.40] whether I am missing or my parents,
[1611.56] no one should get to know this,
[1622.08] because if Aunt Mehreen finds it out,
[1625.64] she will ruin my life
[1633.32] or
[1635.56] she will get another excuse
to get me divorced.
[1660.68] Arooj, please trust me,
[1670.12] next time, any excuse or reality
[1674.96] won’t push me to make 
such a decision.
[1685.12] You can stay here for as long as 
you want to,
[1690.64] but whenever you think of me,
[1695.84] just come back,
[1705.00] I will wait for you.
[1722.60] Take care of yourself.
[1813.44] Arooj is not such a type of girl,
[1816.12] you must have known that by far.
[1818.12] That is the problem,
[1822.40] she doesn’t let me know anything
about her.
[1826.16] My child,
[1828.00] you need to give confidence 
to your wife to know her.
[1832.76] There is no use in saying all this now
[1838.84] because Arooj has created a lot 
of distance between herself and I.
[1843.44] And it is about my trust now.
[1845.76] Had you contacted her friend Shanzey,
[1849.48] you wouldn’t be saying this right now.
[1854.32] I will share one of Arooj’s issues 
with you,
[1858.60] now let’s see if you support her 
after that or not.
[1863.00] Arooj is looking for her parents.
[1866.60] Yes, son.
[1868.92] Arooj is not our biological daughter.
[1874.28] What are you saying, Uncle?
[1876.64] I am right.
[1879.20] Arooj was a few months old 
when I and Naseema found her.
[1893.88] Such a huge thing?
[1897.00] You guys hid such a huge thing 
from me?
[1899.96] You just got worried listening to this,
[1903.88] though Arooj went through 
this problem.
[1906.88] Just imagine
[1910.08] the mental state Arooj is going through.
[1920.08] I loved Arooj,
[1929.56] but I couldn’t fulfill that love yet,
[1938.68] but this time I will prove 
my love for Arooj
[1948.68] by helping her find her parents
[1959.76] and by just supporting Arooj 
in front of Mom.
[2061.96] Come, daughter, sit.
[2070.04] What is it, daughter?
[2074.28] Dad,
[2079.28] forgive me.
[2086.92] Apology for what?
[2093.32] I have hurt both of you a lot,
[2101.96] unintentionally I tried to take you 
off the position of parents,
[2109.96] and you,
[2112.56] both of you are still mine.
[2116.76] My child,
[2123.88] when did we become strangers?
[2133.20] And how will we ever be?
[2136.64] Parents are always your own.
[2145.80] Do you guys know,
[2149.28] both of you have given me the strength
to keep my head high in front of Salman.
[2159.36] my child, we haven’t done 
anything extraordinary,
[2164.88] parents never let down 
their children,
[2171.60] one more thing,
[2175.12] parents aren’t just who give birth,
[2180.68] the parents who raise have 
very high ranks too.
[2197.92] You continue trying,
[2207.64] I pray
[2211.00] that you find the mother 
who birthed you,
[2215.56] we will be happy.
[2222.40] And yes, one more thing,
[2226.40] only the one who has hope to win, wins.
