Salman? Yes mom? Salman, enough of this puppet show, now this show won’t continue 
in this house anymore, that’s it. What do you mean? 
I don’t get it. What didn’t you get? You know everything very well. I don’t know, tell me what are you saying? This show that has been going 
on between Arooj and Ammad, now after that Arooj has no place
 in this house or your life! What do you want, mom? Should I leave Arooj? Yes, absolutely. No, mom. That is not possible. Even after the relationship 
between Arooj and Ammad? You know everything, right? Brother Idrees is here too now. Brother Idrees, you tell me? You know everything too. Arooj and Ammad’s issue. You were the one 
who told me everything. Really? No, I don’t know anything, 
Mehreen, I am sure there is some
 misunderstanding. I don’t know anything. I don’t know. Excuse me. He should have been 
home by now. Where were you? I have been waiting
 for you for so long. Why? Why were you waiting
 for me so desperately? I want to ask you something, tell me, why did Arooj come to office? She can come, she is the part of company and wife of the CEO. But she was in your office. Yes, she must have
 come to get some ... ...suggestion regarding 
some official matter. Suggestion? From you? Doesn’t make sense. You are against Arooj. Yes, that was it, sometimes we make a mistake in ... ...seeing and understanding things,
 in fact, we get misunderstood. Oh, that’s good. At least, you realized 
your mistake. Hmm. Sir Sr, Madam Sr is calling 
you in her room. Hey, I just met her. Yes, she is calling you again. Hmm. Go, now you listen to her, I listen to her all day. Where is this? What difference does it make? What is the importance of it? It is important, it is very important, so that Arooj can 
be questioned that what was she doing 
at this location with Ammad. Where is not important 
in this matter but why is, why are they together? I don’t understand anything. I do, Ammad and Arooj 
are collectively ... planning against 
the company so they can destroy it together. Uncle Idrees did everything 
he could against Arooj, he went against 
Arooj in every way but Arooj was still 
so generous to him. And even Uncle shut himself up, did Arooj make Uncle
 remain quiet by bribing ... ...him against the revelation
 of some secret? No, no, that is not possible. Uncle cannot be that 
weak and greedy. So then what is the matter? Arooj, I want to 
ask you something. Sure, ask. What was the reason that 
made Uncle hate you? Wow, the question that you 
should be asking Uncle, you are asking me instead. I think he would be able to answer 
this question better for you. Yes, but can I at least ask you
 about you doing him this favor all of a sudden? When the wrong has been fixed then what is the 
investigation about? Arooj, I should have 
knowledge about it. Salman, you promised me that you wouldn’t ask me any
 question regarding this. And by the way, there are two types of
 people in this world, good and bad, and whatever you can see, if there is something bad behind it, so yes, you have the right to ask but please right now I can just request you to not ask me any question regarding this, 
it would be better. Pick it up carefully and be careful, nothing should break. Arooj, what is all this? I have shutdown the office. shutdown the office, but why? Because I think it is
 not needed now. I have handed over 
the responsibility of Finance to Uncle 
and Nawaz. Arooj, look, 
whatever happened, you shouldn’t have
 shutdown this office. I did what I had to. And I am sure, whatever decision I have taken will be for the company’s benefit and I don’t need this office
 anymore now anyway. Yes, yes, why would she need 
this office now, when he is not here the one, because of whom she 
was interested in this office. Biscuits, let me check, oh dude, everything had to finish today. What should I do? Let me text Shanzey. Shanzey, I am texting you 
the names of mom’s medicines and her
 favorite biscuits, do bring them when you come. In fact, let me call her. Hello Shanzey? Yes, Ammad? Shanzey, what are you 
doing right now? Can you come to my home? Why? Is everything okay? Yes, actually 
I cannot leave home, mom is very unwell and I have texted you
 the names of mom’s favorite biscuits and medicines, can you bring them? Ammad, what was the need of such prolonged cover
 for such petty thing? I am just bringing them. And Shanzey, I have transferred the
 money to your account. What can I say to you Ammad? Okay, I am coming, okay bye. Bye, umm thank you. This boy… Here, take these files and keep this laptop in my 
room and keep it safely. Okay Madam Jr, shall I ask you something,
 Madam Jr? Yes. Why did you shut 
down this office? It was good it used
 to remain crowded. you won’t get it. Keep these things in my room. Whatever you order. You never contacted
 after University, you disappeared 
somewhere. Madam, you are the 
one who is lost, how could have 
I contacted? By the way, you have achieved 
what you had to, good. Hmm, I achieved it and you? Won’t you tell me about yourself? A middle class boy is always
 after making his future, we don’t even study to study. College, university, 
we just go there for a good job. The same old style, the same revolutionary talks. Yes, my talks have just been talks, I couldn’t bring the revolution. You can’t even bring it. Arooj, what is all this? What, Aunt? Why did you shut down 
your office? I didn’t shut it down, I just shifted it to the old place. Okay, and tell me, what has happened? Idrees has changed completely 
after the meeting. You have even 
raised his salary? All of this so suddenly? Now you will ask me 
the reason behind all this? Yes, tell me? I should even know. According to the agreement, I cannot disclose 
anything regarding the meeting outside office, I am sorry. Arooj, please. Okay. The actual reality… None of you would be able to hear it, I have to take care of 
everyone’s heart and I even have to take care of 
all the relationships. Mom, take your medicines. And we have ran out of 2 
of your medicines, I have asked Shanzey 
she is bringing them. Who can it be at this time? It must be Shanzey, son. You know it very well. You are waiting so much for her? Why wouldn’t I? My daughter is so nice. I will be right back. Yes? Sir Salman, you? At my home? Please come in. Come, please, sir. It is very small, it is not lavish like your house but people live here who love each other a lot. Love. By the way tell me something, why didn’t you marry yet? You came here to ask me this? No. I have to ask a lot of other things. Come in, let’s sit and talk. Please, come in, Sir Salman. Sir Salman, this is my mother. Greetings. Greetings. Mom, this is Sir Salman, where I used to work. Oh, so this is your ex-boss, I mean, was. Have a seat, son. Please, come. I insisted him a lot that he should resign but he didn’t listen to
 me even for once, he said that the office people 
don’t need me. I tried to make him understand
 a million times that you are very talented, it’s not possible that the office people don’t need you. Mom. Let me finish. So what was I saying? I was saying that I told him that the people at your office will
 realize your value one day. And look now you are here to convince 
my Ammad today. Mom, we have guests at home, please make tea. Yes, my child, I’ll just go make it. No, please let it be, 
it is not needed at all. You are already unwell, 
so you must rest. No problem, son, we rarely get guests at our home and whenever they do, we keep them with a lot of love, hmm? Pick up the phone, Uncle, I think you are getting call from
 two different places. I will attend it, it is my problem. By the way, you keep two numbers, right? No there is just one number. Oh ho, then there must be a lot of 
confusion that you face, when the first one calls, you must be taking 
the second one’s name, and when the second calls, you must be taking the 
first one’s name. Are you not going to 
the office, today? Hmm? What? What did you say? I am asking, are you not 
going to the office today? yes, I don’t feel like it. Why? Are you feeling well? Hmm. I found out that… What? What did you find out? You are panicking like 
I caught your secret. Anyways, I found out that last night Mehreen asked you to give 
a statement against Arooj and you didn’t say a word? How did the tables turn
 all of a sudden? No, nothing, I promised you that Arooj is Salman’s wife and our daughter in law so I thought that if Salman actually loves 
Arooj the I should too. Thank God, you understood what I said. We cannot call Salman our son or Arooj our daughter in law, at least we can give them 
love and affection. Yes, absolutely, absolutely. Okay and… Yes? Arooj has left Salman’s office and she was saying she would take care 
of the house now. Corruption of 10 million in 
Sasa builder’s project, 5 million commission 
in multinet advertising, very nice. And the weirdest corruption that was beyond 
my understanding, I guess you might
 help me with this, stone bury’s marble, it was purchased for Rs64 lac, but that is not important, what’s important is, where did that marble go? She repented for oppression
 after my murder, but she destroyed my marital life. Sir Salman, tell me why did you come here? I have never had any direct 
conversation with you. Mr. Salman, talk to me openly about 
whatever you are here to say, there is no one except
 you and I here. Arooj, what is the relationship 
between you and Arooj? Why didn’t you ask 
that question to Arooj, she would have answered
 it better for you. She is not answering 
me better that is why I am asking you. Answer my question. Both of you were class fellows,
 right? [00:31:04.10l Yes, that’s how it is. And I have heard that you used to like Arooj. What happened? Why is there so much silence? Nothing mom, give it to me and you may go and rest. My child, if your heart if at peace, there will be abundant of rest in life. Did you hear what mom said? if your heart if at peace, there will be abundant of rest in life. Only if there is peace. You didn’t answer my question. Mr Salman, trust me, this piping hot tea is way more 
important than your question. Have it and trust me, Arooj is a nice girl. Wasai, tell me how does this 
change look? It looks nice, right? Wasai tell.. Aunt, you? Oh wow, you thought of decorating 
home very soon? I have always heard and
 now I even saw it, fools return home. You don’t get it? It’s very straight, when that guy left you, then you remembered my son’s room? Aunt, please! Don’t talk about my character, I know that you really
 like hurting me because unfortunately, 
you are my mother-in-law. Unfortunately? Yes, unfortunately. Unfortunately,
 you are my mother-in-law, though I wanted you
 to be my mother. If I had a daughter like you, I would have choked her by 
my own hands and killed her. Mother’s never choke
 their daughters. The character that you have, who can leave a 
husband like Salman and fulfill her old friendships, should be killed. Enough! Enough now! I have done enough now it is Salman’s turn. And I know my Salman very well, he has gone after Ammad. Just pray, Arooj, that Salman is not able 
to get hold of Ammad.
