[30.44] Yes, madam, 
did you want something?
[34.24] Why? Is it necessary to tell you?
[36.24] No, no,
[37.48] I was just asking because
[44.00] you came to the kitchen,
[45.76] then you wanted me to do something.
[48.56] That’s why I asked.
[52.00] Yes, work…
[53.76] What is this being cooked?
[56.96] I am making soup for younger madam.
[62.64] How long will it take to be ready?
[65.44] It will take some time.
[72.04] Even little master was asking me,
[75.00] when the soup gets ready, tell me,
[77.84] I will take it for younger madam myself.
[83.24] Okay, this will take some time.
[85.56] So, you do one thing, 
I have kept some clothes of Idrees,
[88.84] keep them in the laundry room, 
so that they get ironed. Go.
[94.24] What am I asking you? 
Leave it.
[96.28] This is getting cooked right now. 
Go keep the clothes first. Go.
[99.52] Sure.
[129.84] Whatever Mehreen did with 
Arooj was absolutely right.
[135.76] One picture.
[137.32] She just sees one picture and says that
this is me and I am the daughter of this home.
[140.80] Just one picture.
[142.48] But she makes the claim with 
so much confidence,
[144.60] like she some other proof too.
[150.24] We don’t have to look away 
in this situation,
[153.04] we will have to face this situation
face to face
[157.84] or else we will be out of this game.
[165.76] The game that was planned for years,
[168.32] will get turned over in a moment.
[232.28] the water is above head.
[234.44] If we think more, we will drown.
[238.20] We will drown anyway, 
think if we get caught, then?
[243.28] You think that I am so stupid
[245.96] that I do something that 
I get caught. Never.
[249.08] What stupidity is this?
[250.88] Salman will go crazy if something 
happens to Arooj,
[253.52] to find out who her murderer is.
[256.00] and if Arooj lives,
[258.44] we will not have anything 
in our hands.
[260.68] Nothing.
[265.72] So, we will have to remove Arooj 
from our way.
[272.12] Even I want that because 
with Arooj there,
[275.08] we have nothing but humiliation
in our fate.
[282.88] Half the work is done,
[286.92] now the other half is left.
[411.60] Congratulations, mom.
[416.64] You are going to be a grandmother.
[421.44] God answered your prayers.
[425.72] Really?
[428.40] What is the matter, mom?
[430.96] Are you not happy?
[432.84] Are you happy?
[439.40] That is enough.
[444.16] What do you mean?
[450.96] You really wanted that I become a 
father and you become a grandmother.
[468.04] Salman is at home,
[477.84] still you are talking to his picture.
[483.12] I am just cleaning up, Sister-in-law.
[495.24] I can talk to him whenever I want.
[500.08] But there is one thing.
[508.00] When I want, 
I cannot talk to him,
[516.28] but when he wants, 
he can talk to me.
[526.64] He doesn’t get free from Arooj,
[530.68] she has him imprisoned.
[535.32] So, how is it difficult to set Salman 
free from Arooj’s imprisonment?
[545.80] This can be done.
[557.44] How Sister-in-law? 
Tell me.
[560.56] Look,
[562.92] when matters are not getting 
resolved with strictness,
[567.20] you need to be polite.
[570.28] With love, with affection.
[573.80] What do you think 
I don’t love Salman?
[577.60] No, no, you surely love him.
[580.84] Everyone accepts that 
you love Salman,
[586.44] I am talking about Arooj.
[593.84] You really have to take care 
of Arooj.
[597.76] In fact, you have to tell Salman
[600.48] how much you love Arooj, 
how much you care for her.
[604.16] Then you will see.
[608.56] What will happen then?
[609.84] What will happen then?
[612.08] Salman will praise you.
[615.68] And if Arooj misbehaves 
then you will see,
[619.36] he will drag her out of the home 
in one minute.
[623.84] If Arooj misbehaves with me,
[627.08] then my Salman will kill her.
[634.08] So, fine, you understand 
what I said, right?
[637.80] You just have to take care of Arooj.
[645.84] You have to love Arooj so much
[648.76] that Arooj too believes your love.
[652.28] Salman is your own,
[654.80] then you have nothing to worry about.
[660.60] Okay Sister-in-law, is that true?
[663.32] Yes, now do you know?
[666.72] Salman has asked Wasai 
to make soup for Arooj
[670.00] and he will take that soup 
for Arooj himself.
[673.68] But that will not happen.
[675.24] You will take soup for Arooj.
[679.12] Mehreen, think,
[680.56] when Salman sees it, 
he will be so happy.
[744.48] Sister-in-law Shaista,
[746.48] when I am asking Salman, 
then what is the need to ask him?
[750.56] So, don’t I even have a right 
to ask him?
[753.28] His mother is there,
[755.36] so you have no right.
[765.68] I am asking you something.
[767.28] I told you nothing happened.
[772.08] You people are asking me 
the same question again and again?
[775.88] What do you want? 
I don’t have food?
[779.12] I won’t.
[780.08] Salman, what happened?
[781.68] Salman, sit have…
Sal…
[784.52] Sister-in-law Shaista, 
all this happened because of you.
[787.56] What did I do?
[788.84] What was the need for you 
to ask Salman,
[790.80] you spoiled his mood.
[794.00] And brother Idrees, you talk about 
the office in the office,
[797.68] or else you know Salman never 
reacts like this when I talk to him.
[806.04] We at times consider someone wrong.
[818.92] But later on, we find out,
[825.16] that we are at fault.
[832.80] And the one in front of us
[838.96] is right.
[845.88] And today,
[860.88] I realized how much of a well-wisher 
Sister-in-law Shaista is for me.
[906.00] You really wanted that I become a 
father and you become a grandmother.
[913.76] Yes,
[916.08] but right now you become happy
[925.36] that at least you are going to get 
some happiness from this Arooj.
[940.00] Or else
[941.80] this girl has always given you sorrow.
[980.96] Arooj.
[983.48] Yes?
[990.88] Are you feeling okay?
[995.44] Yes.
[997.84] I am fine.
[1006.24] Why do you think this way?
[1009.40] I will get these thoughts daily 
till the delivery doesn’t happen.
[1017.56] God will make it all fine.
[1023.68] A mother sacrifices so much 
for her children.
[1035.56] A child can never repay her mother 
for what she did.
[1040.48] You are right.
[1043.76] There is no replacement for a mother.
[1055.68] A mother is really great.
[1067.68] And you know,
[1070.60] when a girl becomes a mother herself,
[1074.00] then the worth of her mother 
increases further in her eyes.
[1078.84] Arooj, you are missing 
your mother again.
[1090.40] I promise you, 
I will help you,
[1092.64] your parents will be found soon.
[1117.60] Now there is no need for that.
[1126.88] What are you thinking?
[1131.08] Nothing.
[1133.24] Okay, you know, I have thought 
of a name for our daughter.
[1139.20] Really?
[1140.96] You know, I have also thought of a name.
[1143.88] Really?
[1145.24] What have you thought?
[1146.76] I won’t tell you right now.
[1148.08] And I am sure everyone will like 
my name more.
[1153.56] Okay let’s see how your choice is.
[1203.20] You look really good like this,
[1209.24] when you get upset, 
then I don’t like you at all.
[1213.64] Really?
[1215.60] Then don’t upset me.
[1217.56] I upset you?
[1222.24] And what about you going 
around like a hero?
[1228.36] You are good at heart,
[1230.56] but you listen to everyone,
[1233.56] you get misled quickly.
[1237.40] Okay fine,
[1239.00] everything is fine between us. 
Yes?
[1304.80] Wasai.
[1307.16] Yes, madam.
[1309.12] Where are you going?
[1310.44] Little master had told me
[1312.40] that if the soup is ready 
for younger madam,
[1315.20] then inform me.
[1316.32] So I was going to inform him.
[1318.76] So is the soup ready?
[1320.12] Yes. Yes, the soup is ready.
[1333.20] Fine,
[1334.92] I will take it.
[1336.48] But little master…
[1337.92] I said, I will take it.
[1341.56] Come with me. 
Sure.
[1361.16] Mehreen’s lost daughter Areej 
is Arooj?
[1366.28] Who told you this?
[1367.44] I heard Wasai and 
Arooj talking myself.
[1372.16] What is the proof of this?
[1374.24] I saw the old picture in Wasai’s room.
[1379.40] You had made Wasai burn 
that picture, right?
[1383.20] You look at Wasai’s disobedience,
[1385.64] look at her courage, 
she had kept that picture safe.
[1389.92] That picture has revealed the secret.
[1396.72] Whatever has happened is not right.
[1399.96] The one who we had put out 
of the game,
[1403.60] she has come back to the game
as your daughter in law.
[1411.44] Well done, Mehreen,
[1417.40] you made my job easy.
[1423.68] Everyone knows you are Arooj’s enemy.
[1431.56] Now I will kill two birds with one stone.
[1437.04] Arooj will die
[1442.00] and Mehreen will be the murderer.
[1461.00] Arooj, I was thinking, let’s go out.
[1468.04] Yes.
[1469.32] Let’s go.
[1478.32] After all, I don’t know why 
I feel suffocated.
[1483.00] If I breath in open air,
I will feel better.
[1487.04] Fine, then, let’s go.
[1489.00] Let’s go.
[1501.68] Watch your step.
[1504.92] Careful. Careful.
[1506.40] I am fine.
[1509.84] Where are you people going?
[1513.68] Mom, actually,
[1515.44] Arooj was feeling restless, 
so I thought
[1518.28] I would take her for an outing.
[1522.24] Okay.
[1523.88] I had made soup for Arooj 
and I brought it for her.
[1528.56] For me?
[1539.20] Why?
[1542.20] Can I not make soup for you?
[1545.52] You can.
[1548.08] You surely can.
[1560.72] Mama, when we come back 
from the outing,
[1562.72] then Arooj will come back 
and have it.
[1563.92] No, no, Salman, we will go 
after having the soup.
[1567.68] I will first have soup.
[1582.44] Arooj,
[1584.36] you were feeling restless, 
you were not well.
[1588.48] I will stop feeling restless, in fact,
the restlessness is gone.
[1592.04] She made soup for me 
with so much love,
[1594.32] I will have soup and…
[1636.00] Mom, are you fine?
[1638.40] Yes,
[1639.76] I am fine.
[1641.36] Wasai.
[1643.36] Yes, coming.
[1647.44] Clean this, and take this.
[1650.96] Sure.
[1701.60] Shaista, I was telling you.
[1704.08] I am thankful that your poison didn’t 
reach where you wanted it to reach.
[1708.76] I don’t understand you, Idrees.
[1714.56] Closing your eyes like a pigeon 
doesn’t make the cat run away.
[1723.76] Before our game is over,
[1726.00] we have to do something.
[1728.84] When am I saying we sit here 
doing nothing,
[1731.56] but I am not in favor of 
what you are doing.
[1734.20] Okay,
[1735.76] then you tell me what we should do.
[1746.84] Have you thought if Mehreen finds out
[1750.40] that Arooj is her daughter, Areej,
[1752.44] then where will we stand?
[1759.88] How many lies will be uncovered 
with this one truth?
[1765.96] Nothing will happen.
[1767.32] You just be smart instead of being
emotional. Use your head.
[1771.12] I don’t have so much time 
that I think,
[1774.08] I act in my senses.
[1779.64] It will not take a minute for this 
whole game to get spoiled,
[1782.68] and that one minute can also 
be the next minute.
[1788.60] Telling the truth is not that easy,
[1791.08] you just wait for the opportunity.
[1797.00] Removing Arooj from our way 
is our helplessness,
[1799.84] not our greatness.
[1801.68] The great thing would be that 
she has no proof left with her.
[1827.36] I had made this entire game
for my son, Salman
[1833.88] and Arooj became the owner 
of the entire business.
[1839.08] The game hasn’t been spoiled 
that much,
[1841.32] your daughter in law owns 
the entire business.
[1846.72] You are forgetting,
[1852.36] before being my daughter in law, 
Arooj is Mehreen’s daughter.
[1857.44] If everything belongs to the 
daughter in law, then it means
[1861.64] that including Salman all of us 
are dependent on her.
[1867.00] She had already entered 
this business,
[1869.88] now she will come with 
much more force.
[1871.24] Mehreen was right,
[1874.16] what she did with Arooj was right.
[1878.00] This Arooj deserves this.
[1922.28] Mom, actually, 
Arooj was feeling restless,
[1925.20] so I thought I would take her
 for an outing.
[1930.72] Okay.
[1932.36] I had made soup for Arooj and 
I brought it for her.
[1937.08] For me?
[1939.00] Why?
[1941.80] Can I not make soup for you?
[1945.20] You can.
[1947.60] You surely can.
[1951.08] Mama, when we come back 
from the outing,
[1952.84] then Arooj will come back 
and have it.
[1954.04] No, no, Salman, we will go 
after having the soup.
[1957.92] I will first have soup.
[1960.80] Arooj,
[1962.72] you were feeling restless, 
you were not well.
[1966.80] I will stop feeling restless, in fact, 
the restlessness is gone.
[1970.52] She made soup for me 
with so much love,
[1972.64] I will have soup and…
[1987.76] Arooj, come on.
[1990.88] It was just a bowl, 
so what if it broke?
[1995.76] It was nothing normal for me, Salman.
[2008.44] Aunty, addressed me like this 
for the first time.
[2012.84] She had owned me.
[2023.76] She made soup for me 
and I dropped it.
[2029.12] Okay, no issues, 
the soup will be made again.
[2031.96] What is there to be so sad 
about in this?
[2040.92] Okay come on, get fresh, 
fix yourself.
[2043.96] All this is not good for you 
and our child at all.
[2056.08] Okay, come on, tell me now,
[2057.84] what name have you thought 
for our child.
[2062.52] I told you, I won’t tell you
[2065.36] and you won’t tell me either.
[2072.48] I will announce the name of 
the child in front of everyone
[2076.52] and surely,
[2078.60] everyone will like it.
[2081.76] Okay fine, you announce it 
in front of everyone.
[2088.64] You know what?
[2090.84] We will name our child, 
whatever you have thought of.
[2100.80] Be happy now.
[2103.12] Smile.
[2104.52] Really?
[2105.96] That’s like a good girl.
[2114.64] Now shall we go for an outing?
[2117.92] Yes.
[2119.16] Come on. let’s go.
[2134.40] You were right Sister-in-law.
[2138.28] Salman was really happy 
on my behavior.
[2143.32] Salman had to get happy.
[2147.68] But did you see Arooj?
[2150.60] Sister-in-law, I had no hopes,
[2153.96] she took the bowl from my hands 
happily and with love.
[2159.44] You are really naïve, Mehreen
[2161.92] and Arooj is cunning.
[2167.68] What is the matter Sister-in-law?
[2170.00] You never spoke like this 
about Arooj earlier.
[2174.92] What happened now?
[2176.36] I made a mistake. I am so sorry.
[2180.40] I got late in understanding her.
[2187.32] I always considered you wrong
[2190.60] and took Arooj’s side.
[2197.72] But Mehreen, you were right.
[2203.32] Arooj is actually cunning.
[2207.04] She along with Salman,
[2209.44] wants to take over this home 
and the entire business.
[2218.32] Did you not see her cunningness?
[2221.36] She took the bowl from your hand 
with so much love,
[2225.44] and then dropped it 
on the floor on purpose.
[2234.40] Mehreen, you think yourself.
[2237.12] Was that bowl really that heavy,
[2241.44] that she couldn’t control it?
[2244.52] You are right, Sister-in-law,
[2247.88] I didn’t think of that.
[2251.80] Now don’t think of anything,
[2254.56] and believe me Mehreen
[2257.72] and forgive me,
[2260.52] that I considered you wrong.
[2267.92] Although you are much more 
farsighted and smarter than me.
