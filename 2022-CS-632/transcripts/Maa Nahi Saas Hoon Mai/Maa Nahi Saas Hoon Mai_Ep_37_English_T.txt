[73.80] You are not that naïve either.
[75.88] You know well what I am asking you.
[77.88] What did you do that my son left home
and went to Islamabad.
[82.72] Aunty, I am just finding out from you 
that Salman is in Islamabad.
[89.84] Believe me, I don’t know anything 
about this matter,
[92.44] nor did I talk to Salman.
[94.84] Yes,
[95.80] when you upset my son, then 
why would he talk to you?
[145.76] Oh wow, Arooj,
[147.24] I used to consider myself to be smart,
[149.76] but you are much greater than me.
[152.56] You are getting upset with me 
for no reason.
[156.12] I honestly don’t know anything.
[158.60] Arooj, let me find out once, 
then you will see what I will do.
[214.68] I am your wife.
[217.56] Did you call me to tell me this?
[220.32] I have to say a lot,
[223.60] but you are not ready to listen.
[273.64] Arooj,
[275.56] what happened? 
Are you crying?
[279.20] Come here. 
Come and sit here.
[284.84] Sit here.
[288.20] What happened?
[292.00] I don’t understand aunt,
[295.24] why does aunt Mehreen always 
hold me responsible?
[300.64] Why am I questioned about everything 
in this home?
[305.28] No matter what happens in this home, 
why am I answerable for it?
[311.68] What did Mehreen say now?
[317.32] Aunt, if Salman is going to another city
without informing anyone,
[321.16] then what is my fault in this?
[327.64] Did you ask, Salman?
[334.00] He doesn’t want to talk to me.
[336.68] Look, Arooj, child,
[338.28] if Salman’s trust can be established
[342.04] if you fire Ammad from the job,
[345.96] then you fire him from them job.
[349.60] I cannot do that.
[351.60] What do you mean you cannot do it?
[354.56] His mother is a cancer patient,
[357.36] and he gets his mother’s treatment 
done with his salary.
[360.96] How can I leave him alone 
in this condition?
[364.20] You are right, child,
[366.96] but at times a person should become
selfish for the sake of love.
[373.32] It is a question of your own life.
[376.68] But, aunt…
No, buts.
[379.32] You help Ammad in some other way.
[386.76] You don’t know him,
[390.60] he will not take a single penny from me.
[395.12] He has a lot of self-respect.
[421.88] This fake mother of my son, Mehreen
[428.48] She is making the life of my son and 
daughter in law’s life hell.
[458.48] Greetings.
[459.56] Brother Ammad, your bill is for eleven 
thousand three hundred and sixty rupees.
[462.24] Eleven thousand three hundred 
and sixty rupees.
[469.04] One, two, three, four, five, 
six, seven, eight, nine.
[473.40] I have nine thousand.
[475.64] Brother, do one thing, take out 
some medication from it.
[478.80] Because I only have nine thousand 
rupees.
[481.28] Brother Ammad, no issue. 
You can pay later.
[483.56] Money comes and goes.
[486.04] Later, but…
[487.28] I will only be able to pay 
after I get my salary.
[490.56] Fine, no issue.
[492.36] Thank you, man.
[493.36] Thank you. 
Your bill is for two thousand rupees.
[506.60] Excuse me, son.
[508.64] Yes?
[509.64] Is everything okay? 
Who is unwell?
[512.84] My mother is unwell.
[515.92] Oh, what happened to her?
[521.96] She has cancer.
[524.48] Oh may God give her health.
[531.48] Son, can I help you in some way?
[535.52] Yes.
[537.04] Prayer.
[540.64] Pray for her.
[543.32] Yes, sure, son.
[545.92] Okay, I will leave. I am getting late.
[548.36] Okay.
[578.84] Mehreen, you have blown things 
out of proportions.
[581.56] Brother Idrees, 
I did what you had told me.
[589.48] Then what is the point?
[590.52] Ammad is still on the job, 
she still hasn’t fired him.
[593.08] What do I do, brother Idrees?
[594.84] I could have asked Salman,
 so I did that.
[597.64] Now Arooj doesn’t want to fire that boy,
 then what can we do?
[601.20] This is worrisome and 
what is this Salman doing?
[605.16] His wife is not listening to him, 
that too on a business issue.
[608.60] I am surprised. 
Surprised.
[614.16] I think this is the sorrow my son has
[616.20] because of which he went to Islamabad
secretly, without informing anyone.
[621.56] What do you mean? 
Is Salman upset with Arooj?
[625.80] Obviously, brother Idrees,
[627.76] it is the doing of Arooj
[629.84] that always distance the son 
from the mother.
[638.20] Look Mehreen, there is just 
one solution for this entire issue,
[640.60] that Ammad is fired from the job.
[646.48] Think yourself, we used to have 
laughter in this home earlier,
[649.36] now we have friction and distances, 
and Ammad is the reason for it.
[655.36] Had Ammad not been there, 
nor would Salman have had a doubt,
[658.08] and neither would we have had 
an issue in this home. Think.
[661.80] You are right.
[663.92] Let Salman come, 
I will make him decide.
[675.60] And I know well that you are worried 
cause of these matters at home.
[680.40] Yes.
[685.68] Fine, I will go.
[693.00] This girl is embarrassing me 
in front of everyone.
[720.28] You people stop it.
[722.44] How long will you people conspire 
against your own home?
[727.00] How are you talking to me, Shaista?
[729.40] You have forced me to 
talk to you like this.
[735.12] What crime did I commit?
[736.80] Crime?
[738.08] You are just talking about a crime?
[741.80] You and Mehreen have made Arooj
 and Salman’s life hell.
[749.24] I am disappointed at you, Idrees.
[754.16] You even forgot that the one whose life 
you are ruining is your own son.
[761.16] How can I forget that Salman is my son 
and Arooj my daughter in law?
[765.00] That’s what you have forgotten.
[769.40] But I want to know why 
you have forgotten this?
[773.72] Answer me.
[779.12] You don’t have an answer, right?
[785.04] How will you have it?
[787.64] You have done something of the sort.
[789.56] What did I do?
[791.64] You made false stories about 
Arooj and Ammad’s affair.
[795.76] Shaista, what is wrong with you?
[797.48] Something has happened to you, Idrees.
[800.32] What has the child done to you?
[802.92] Why are you after Arooj?
[805.04] You know nothing, Shaista.
[806.96] You know, right?
[809.36] Then fix everything,
[812.08] because what you are doing right now 
doesn’t suit you.
[850.72] Arooj, you murdered my trust.
[860.16] You shattered my faith.
[870.60] That’s it,
[873.04] not anymore.
[876.16] You did what you had to,
[879.08] now it is my turn.
[881.76] You will have to decide.
[884.28] Ammad or me?
[920.12] This is the same boy
[925.08] that I had met at the medical store
yesterday.
[929.80] Okay, so this is Ammad,
[936.20] who has come between Arooj 
and Salman’s relation.
[943.68] But this child doesn’t seem the way
[946.44] Mehreen and Idress say he is.
[953.76] No, no,
[955.04] if I even say a word in Ammad’s favour,
[962.20] then Mehreen will feel I am opposing her.
[967.04] It is better for me to stay quiet on this.
[970.76] I won’t tell her that I have met Ammad.
[1026.04] Look, Arooj, child,
[1027.56] if Salman’s trust can be established
[1031.24] if you fire Ammad from the job,
[1035.20] then you fire him from them job.
[1037.60] His mother is a cancer patient,
[1040.68] and he gets his mother’s treatment 
done with his salary.
[1044.12] How can I leave him alone 
in this condition?
[1047.28] You are right, child,
[1049.96] but at times a person should become 
selfish for the sake of love.
[1056.16] It is a question of your own life.
[1070.80] What is the matter?
[1072.08] Boss looks like he is in a bad mood
early in the morning.
[1077.64] If you have a bad mood early
in the morning,
[1080.28] then you won’t get customers 
on your shop all day long.
[1083.44] I am in no mood to joke.
[1086.92] You are in a mood for coffee, right?
[1089.44] Or will you ignore it like me?
[1093.36] Thank you.
[1096.44] I feel you are missing Mr. Salman 
because he went for four days.
[1100.84] You know what do they say?
[1102.72] Who do I dress up for?
[1104.84] Who I do I make my hair for?
[1110.60] Come on, man. Smile.
[1115.52] Smile, Arooj.
[1137.68] Ammad is asking you 
with so much love,
[1143.96] so you should smile.
[1160.44] Madam. Madam.
[1165.12] Where did madam go?
[1175.32] What happened? 
Why are you shouting?
[1177.32] Madam, little master is back.
[1181.80] Salman came back so soon?
[1183.92] Idrees said he will come 
after four days.
[1186.76] Madam, that’s what I came to tell you.
[1191.00] Yes, so he wouldn’t have been 
able to focus,
[1194.32] away from his own, 
away from his home,
[1197.08] you tell me, what is your issue?
[1199.32] No. No. Madam, I have no issue.
[1203.60] You know little master got upset 
with little madam and went.
[1209.28] And now that he missed his beloved wife,
he came running.
[1214.44] Now I don’t know
[1217.04] if he came running because 
he was missing her or not.
[1221.72] But little master is standing 
in little madam’s office,
[1226.24] and he is really angry, madam.
[1230.16] And little madam and Mr. Ammad 
is also standing in front of him.
[1236.24] Okay.
[1238.04] Madam, you come with me.
[1240.80] I am really worried.
[1242.80] Little master is really angry.
[1245.08] You come with me.
[1247.08] Come on. 
Come on.
[1255.56] Boss, you were going to come 
after a few days, right?
[1259.92] Why?
[1264.32] Should I not have come?
[1269.40] Did I disturb you people?
[1274.48] No, there is nothing like that.
[1284.88] Because I always say your personality 
is really dashing.
[1289.32] I feel really happy when I see you.
[1302.04] Salman will you sit here,
[1304.36] or will you go meet aunt first?
[1306.28] You tell me,
[1308.76] where should I be.
[1325.52] And yes,
[1330.24] no matter how dashing the boss is,
[1337.84] you are never happy to meet him.
[1341.88] No.
[1344.88] You are happy to see some bosses.
[1347.52] You are mistaken.
[1353.20] Ammad, you please go from here.
[1358.84] Wait.
[1363.88] I want to talk to Ammad.
[1368.36] Son, Salman, when did you come?
[1371.76] And what is this?
[1372.68] You came straight to the office 
as soon as you came.
[1374.44] Come on, come get fresh. 
You go ahead, I will come.
[1380.08] Hey, son. Come on. Come.
[1382.56] Come on, first get fresh.
[1384.76] You just came and you started working.
[1409.68] Arooj.
[1410.60] Ammad, please leave from here.
[1412.44] Leave me alone.
[1425.72] Okay.
[1469.40] Come here.
[1471.28] What were you doing? Huh?
[1475.44] Salman, I am asking you.
[1478.08] I am really angry at you.
[1481.16] I know.
[1482.72] So, I want to ask you
[1484.28] that why did you turn against your wife
listening to Mehreen and Idrees?
[1489.48] I didn’t listen to anyone.
You did.
[1493.36] At least you are accepting
[1495.32] that you have been misled about Arooj.
[1500.28] I have no misunderstanding.
[1502.96] I have noted everything myself.
[1504.88] What did you note?
[1506.80] Could you please explain?
[1510.20] That’s what I was asking to Arooj,
[1512.92] that if she can explain her relation 
with Ammad.
[1516.28] But she didn’t say anything.
[1518.04] She shouldn’t even have answered son.
[1521.48] As good as a wife she is,
[1524.36] she stayed quiet on this stupid question 
of yours, she tolerated it, it is great.
[1530.68] Aunt,
[1533.40] you don’t understand me.
[1534.76] You are not understanding, son.
[1541.20] Come on, go. Go to your room.
[1544.44] I will send cool juice for you.
[1546.96] Drink it and think with a calm mind,
[1550.92] focus on your behaviour and 
Arooj’s character.
[1555.68] Come on, go.
[1565.36] Wasai.
[1567.20] Yes, madam, coming.
[1572.76] Make cool fresh orange juice for 
little sir and give it in his room.
[1578.16] Sure, madam.
[1584.92] Madam.
[1589.20] Fine, you may go.
[1598.32] Arooj.
[1604.04] Arooj.
[1610.20] Mr. Salman looked really angry today.
[1618.88] He seemed like he was in a 
bad mood towards me.
[1624.12] No, you have a misunderstanding.
[1629.20] Yes,
[1631.16] but why was he talking to me like this?
[1635.52] That’s how he talks to everyone.
[1639.80] Talk.
[1642.24] That reminds me,
[1645.64] that Mr. Salman was going to say 
something important to me,
[1649.56] but madam Shaista interfered, 
so that was left incomplete.
[1656.40] Thank God,
[1658.48] it was left incomplete
[1662.48] or else maybe you wouldn’t be here 
right now.
[1670.40] What are you thinking?
[1672.28] No, nothing.
[1675.12] Will you do one thing?
[1676.92] What?
[1678.04] Now we will have to do everything 
really soon.
[1682.16] Yes, fine, but why are you saying this?
[1685.48] Because you cannot see what I can see.
[1690.84] All the files we have opened,
[1693.24] we need to gather the proofs 
on them really soon.
[1699.56] Because we shouldn’t delay in declaring
the accused to criminal,
[1704.72] or else all our game will be spoiled.
[1708.88] What difficult things are you saying?
[1711.32] Before we get into a difficulty,
[1713.44] we will have to end this game.
[1717.56] You know who I am talking about.
[1720.88] Okay. Okay. Relax.
[1725.68] Don’t worry, I will handle everything.
[1761.08] In two days, the wind of two cities 
has tired you so much Salman.
[1769.32] You didn’t even inform your mama
[1772.24] that you were leaving and you didn’t 
inform her as you came back.
[1780.76] What could I tell you?
[1788.44] There was nothing left to tell.
[1792.84] I have never seen my son 
so broken every again.
[1797.32] You are really brave.
[1802.76] Yes.
[1808.04] Brave.
[1816.48] But I don’t understand anything.
[1824.20] I don’t understand that
[1827.12] what is right and what is wrong.
[1832.88] Only my Salman is correct. 
Believe me,
[1838.84] Arooj too is wrong.
[1841.20] You kept that Arooj close to your heart 
even though she wasn’t worthy of it.
[1847.20] If you keep a lowlife close to your heart,
[1850.44] then they will hurt you the same.
[1854.36] Do you understand what I am saying?
[1872.76] I will go to the office.
[1890.36] Think yourself, we used to have 
laughter in this home earlier,
[1893.48] now we have friction and distances,
[1895.20] and Ammad is the reason for it.
[1896.64] Had Ammad not been there, 
nor would Salman have had a doubt,
[1899.16] and neither would we have had 
an issue in this home. Think.
[1924.68] Salman, I want to talk to you.
[1927.24] I don’t have time. 
It is something important.
[1962.80] Because I will not tolerate that…
[1965.12] I want to talk to you.
[1967.48] I will talk to you later.
[1970.16] What are these manners Arooj?
[1971.96] Did no one teach you manners 
to enter someone’s room?
[1975.08] I want to talk to you clearly.
[1977.96] You?
[1979.24] You will talk to me clearly?
[1980.80] Yes, because I am used to 
talking clearly.
[1984.40] Lower your voice and talk to me.
[1986.92] When my reason is considered 
my weakness,
[1989.76] then I need to raise my voice.
[1992.60] Go from here Arooj,
[1994.04] before I say something 
strict towards you.
[1996.96] You, so do it. Why don’t you say it?
[1999.28] I want to know what is in 
your heart after all.
[2005.48] What you talk about behind 
closed doors is called a conspiracy
[2009.12] but it is never the truth.
[2011.40] Tell me what is in your heart? 
Say it to my face.
[2015.36] No one has a need to conspire 
against you.
[2018.72] You are your own worst enemy.
[2022.56] What?
[2023.68] What are you looking at?
[2025.96] You are your own enemy.
[2028.20] My son, Salman, someone so affluent 
added to his life and you...
[2033.60] You showed him your true colours?
[2037.52] True colours?
[2039.68] Really?
[2041.12] What colours have I shown, 
tell me as well.
[2046.04] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything.
[2048.40] Girls like you cannot be talked 
to about anything,
[2051.04] in fact their mothers are cursed, 
who have given birth to a daughter like you.
[2054.76] Don’t say a word about my mother.
[2058.92] That’s why I am saying that 
I don’t want to say anything,
[2062.60] because it is girls like you 
who give the people a chance to talk.
[2066.84] Go from here, now. Leave.
[2086.96] I don’t know what mothers give 
birth to such children.
[2094.16] Ill-mannered girl.
[2126.20] I don’t want to talk to you about anything.
[2128.84] Girls like you cannot be talked 
to about anything,
[2131.76] in fact their mothers are cursed,
[2133.20] who have given birth to 
a daughter like you.
[2135.24] Don’t say a word about my mother.
[2173.80] That’s why I am saying that 
I don’t want to say anything,
[2177.56] because it is girls like you 
who give the people a chance to talk.
[2181.84] Go from here, now. Leave.
