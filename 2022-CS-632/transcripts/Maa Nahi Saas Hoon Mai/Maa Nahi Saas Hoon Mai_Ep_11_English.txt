Did Salman bring you here? Aunty, Salman didn’t bring me, I came here myself. That’s it, are you tired of arguing with me? Or do you still want to argue
 that you came here. You are Salman’s mother, so you are my mother too. Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare call me mother. I am just Salman’s mother. Never forget that. Shall we go home, mama? The doctors have discharged you. The ones because of whom 
this girl argues with me, didn’t come to meet me? It is not like that, mama. Those people wanted to come, I told them not to. Come on. What sort of a man is he? He is one thing in a moment
 and another in the next moment. He changes in an instance. Papa called, he wants to come over. Say no to them. Whatever happened is
 because of them. What do they want to 
prove coming here? Move. Get on the side. Mama. Mama. Send me the file for
 the new project, and update me on tomorrow’s meeting. Right sir. Thank you Good afternoon sir. Good afternoon. Sit. Sit. Sit. Uncle you should have called me. It is the same thing, son. Salman, I didn’t expect this from you. You raised your hand on Urooj. I made a mistake. Making a mistake is not a big deal, the reason that forces you
 to make that mistake is big. She misbehaved with mama. I couldn’t tolerate it. It will take Urooj some time to 
understand our environment, you didn’t good raising 
your hand at her like that. I know. I am embarrassed. In fact, I even apologized to her. Relations are really delicate, they need the same amount of care as a new born child. Even a new born child gets
 scared of loud noises, and then they stay 
scared all their life. Just like that if relations 
get scared, then you have to live your life alone. I am sure you understood 
what I said. Yes, Salman. I think you have still
 not accepted my sorry. Maybe I should have said sorry. Why? Why you? I think I said too much in front of aunt. Yes, you should have said sorry on this. I will surely do it. Okay Urooj, I am really sorry. I shouldn’t have raised 
my hand at you. I am really embarrassed You know, Salman, I had never even thought
 in my dreams, that my husband will 
raise his hand at me and when you came in my life, I got married to you, then I was completely sure that
 this would never happen. But sadly this happened. Anyway, in future, I will try that you don’t 
even get a chance to do this. I will also try. I have some work, I will put down the phone now. Yes? Yes, there is a party at a friend’s 
place in the evening, you be ready, I will pick you. If you are asking me, I will surely come along. Take care. Be careful, okay? Salman. Where are you people going? The two of us? We are going to a party. Are both of you going? Obviously, the two of us will go. Okay. That’s why I was wondering that my son never does anything
 without my permission. Fine, if you are asking me and going, then surely go. Go. Alright, see you. See you. Shall we go? Hey come on, lets join us. No, thank you. You guys carry on. Come on, let’s dance. Thank you. Come on, let’s dance. What are you doing? What am I doing? You are dancing with girls
 that are strangers. Urooj, please. Come on. I dressed up for you on your 
insistence and came with you. Even though you know that I don’t
 like such environment at all. But I came with you, right? Urooj, what is wrong with you? Salman, let’s go home. But how can we leave the 
party and go in between. Let me enjoy. Fine. Urooj. Hey, come on. No, thanks. Urooj. Where are you going 
leaving the party like this? I had come here on 
your insistence, but I don’t like this 
environment at all, Salman. You enjoy the party, I will wait in the car. They are all my friends. I came to introduce you to them. Come, I will introduce you to everyone. Come on, man. Come. Silence. Silence. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce my beautiful wife to all of you. Urooj Salman. Thank you. Thank you. Enjoy the party. Did you like it? Huh? Give me your hand. Urooj, dance. Enjoy the party. I pray to God everything is fine. Before today, Salman 
has never done this. He has never gotten this late. You are finally back? So late. What is this? Coming 
so late at night. You never used to do this. What has happened to you now? What are you looking over there for? I am asking you something, 
answer me. Mom, you know I am really busy cause of 
business problems in the office. If I get late on one 
day due to a party then what is the issue in this? Fine, if you have enjoyed 
and come, then why did Urooj have that face? Why could I not see that
 happiness on her face? It felt like she is in a bad mood because 
of something. Yes, she is in a bad mood 
because of something. I don’t know what it is, but I do know that she is having problems 
walking with you, and the reason for this problem is that she is different from our class. Mom, I don’t believe in this class. My thinking is not like that at all. Okay now our thinking is different too. I didn’t mean that. Anyway, whatever you meant, I just have one advice. If you convince your wife who
 gets upset without a reason, then you will have to 
convince her all your life. And I want that my Salman lives his 
life as per his will, and not as per Urooj’s will. Go and rest, you must be tired. Go. Goodnight. Goodnight. This is just the beginning. This had to happen. What did you do in the party? I want to know. 
Will you answer me? If it is something important, 
then I will surely respond. Meaning, this is not important 
in your eyes? What? What was the whole mess 
you created in the party. You react in one way, and then you become a different 
person in the next moment? I don’t understand, how will I manage with your
 temperament, Salman? Neither am I so difficult, nor is my temperament so difficult. Nothing is difficult Salman, but maybe I don’t understand
 this lifestyle. What lifestyle don’t 
you understand? What are you saying? What are you saying? For example, let’s talk 
about this party today. Urooj, you are not aware of the 
environment of such parties, that’s why you didn’t like it. and I don’t want to be 
aware of it either, because I don’t like it at all. Okay fine, you don’t like it, so we won’t go to such parties. Are you happy? I will go change and come. I don’t know what type
 of a boy is he? Sometimes I feel he will 
not agree to anything and at times he agrees immediately. What are you doing, Naseema? Master, you know, time has wings. It flies away. Do you remember these clothes? These are the same clothes in which we found Urooj. Yes. Nature had given us a gift, and then Urooj came and made our home lively with her 
voice and her innocence. She grew up so quickly that she has now gone to her home. Nature had given us a responsibility. The way we brought her 
up like daughters, just like that we sent her 
away like a daughter. Thank God. Thank God, for sure. But she made our home, empty. Hey, Urooj is the name of goodness. Nature would have wanted that now she fills someone else’s
 home with happiness. Her scent is still there in this home. Seeing Salman and Urooj, my heart hurts. Why? Is there an issue between them? Yes, there is an issue. A very big issue and the name of that 
issue is Mehreen. She is standing in between 
Urooj and Salman. Mehreen’s temperament 
is like that. Hey, what are you thinking? No Idrees, Mehreen’s temperament 
was not like that. Mehreen changed after 
that scary accident. Her temperament has become
 like this because of us. We for no reason gave 
her so much importance and made her get on our heads. Or you think yourself? You are elder to us, she should be obedient to us. But here, it is the opposite. In this home everyone is obedient to Mehreen. If the two of us had not done this, 
then today… I know now you will say that Mehreen would have died. Idrees no one dies for anyone. Caring extra for her, we have spoiled her. She is becoming a problem for us. Why do you forget what 
the doctor said at that time? I remember it all. My brother didn’t remain, Mehreen became a widow and Mehreen had lost her
 memory in that accident. Had we not given 
her special attention, then maybe she 
would have died or gone mad for the rest of her life. It was such a big accident. Waqar and Mehreen had
 named their daughter Areej with so 
much love and affection, and she disappeared. She disappeared in such a way, that God knows. How can I forget that Areej? As soon as she came, Salman lost his right on all the 
business and properties. The new born child was being 
made to wear a gold bracelet. Anyway, I don’t want to 
remember negative things. Yes, our positivity is 
leaving a good impact. We are being repaid well. Everything is owned by Mehreen, she has all the rights, my son is with her and I have to get insulted. Positivity, hah! You bring up the daughters so that someone marries 
them off with respect. So Salman took her. Can I tell you something? Whenever I have a doubt that Urooj is worried, my heart shudders. I know. You love her even 
more than a mother. I am Urooj’s mother. Master, the love of a mother 
who brings up a child, is way better than a mother 
who gives birth. You are a mother, I cannot compete with you, but a father’s heart is 
delicate the same way. I know you. Your eyes get wet in memories of
 Urooj, when you are sitting alone. Tell me something, do you even know about the one 
you want to surprise or not? You said something so stupid. Why? If you tell the one who you want to
 surprise what the surprise is, then what is the surprise in it? Hey, yes, I didn’t think of this. Man, what can I do? 
I have never loved, so how would I know 
about these things? By the way, this is related to 
common sense and not love. Okay, my philosopher, you go call your Romeo, till then I will see something for myself. Fine. Hello Salman . Hey Urooj, how are you? Yes, I am fine. Tell me, do you have 
a busy schedule today? Busy? Yes, I am really busy tonight. Where are you busy? I have meetings. Important meetings. Who do you have to meet? I cannot tell you everything. Salman, now you will have to tell me. Who are you going to meet? There is a beautiful girl, she has a great voice. What did you say? and where is that girl? On the other side of the phone, she is talking to me. Salman, you are really bad. I swear. I will come soon. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye. Did you talk to your Romeo? Yes, I did. Shall we go now? Yes, come on. See what I got, I will show you. What did you get? It is so late, where is Salman? Yes, Urooj, go ahead. Salman, where are you? You took so long to come. I had told you to come soon today, but no you took so long. Okay tell me quickly, 
where are you? I am just on my way, I am coming home. Have you seen the time? What is the time? It is over 12 am. I had an important meeting, it takes time. Okay, I don’t know anything. You come home quickly. 
I am waiting for you. Okay, I am reaching in a bit. See you. Bye. You are home? I am here, that is 
why you see me? What is the matter? 
You were calling me so much. Is everything fine? Nothing is fine.
