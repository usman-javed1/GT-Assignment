What are you thinking? I am thinking Master that Arooj has taken all of
her signs along with her. You said it yourself, she wanted to show
them to someone so she can find her parents Maybe that’s why. But she never told
us what happened. If something happened only
then she will tell us. I hope she hasn’t started to think
of us as strangers. You mothers are really obsessed
with negative thoughts. Sir I have seen her
behavior changed. Okay please stop worrying yourself. You started to look sick. Where is mom she is
not picking up her phone. I call papa. Arooj calling, Yes child. Greetings father. Greetings. were us mom? She is sitting right here with me. Please give her the phone. yeah sure here you go, please turn on the speaker. Yes child Greetings mom. Greetings, may you always stay
happy and blessed. Your father and I were
just remembering you. I was remembering you but your mom was sitting here worrying
not eating breakfast. What's father saying Mom? Your father is just messing with you. Arooj? Why have you become so quiet? go ahead. Yes I have to talk to you about
something really important. Yes child go ahead. Mother my old bracelet
and old clothes, just right now wasai
have just shown me... .... a picture of a child
wearing the exact same thing. Those clothes and the bracelet looked
exactly the same mother. Why are you so quiet? Arooj child please talk. Mother. Yes my child. that child in that picture is me. And Mehreen Aunty is my mother. And Wasai has confirmed all this. So my child, did you tell your mother in law? I mean your Mother? No dad, her mental is not that well that she can bear any shock and then this will be a huge thing for her. So what will you do now, my child? I will wait for the right time, mom. Okay, my child, whatever you feel is right. Mom, I will talk to later, bye. Bye. Salman is your present that you have in your control but I am here to know which family do you belong to. Do you even have any family or not? After all, whose daughter are you? Mom? Hey, back off, why are you stuck to me? Move back. Mom. What Mom Mom? No mom. Hey move back, why have you glued yourself to me? I am asking you to move back, back off, are you mad? Why are you repeatedly
calling me your mom? I am not your mother. You fool! Madam Jr, I understand your emotion but you getting emotional like this is not the solution to this problem. If a daughter is calling
her mother, a mother, then what is wrong in it? Doctors have always warned us, that any huge shock or accident can make her completely mad, or she could even die. God Forbid, I don’t want to lose
my mom once again. Then have some patience
Madam Jr, you can tell everyone
the truth at the right time. This world is so small, Naseema Begum, you find people if they are alive. It is so unfortunate, Master, Arooj cannot tell Mehreen that she is her daughter, she will go through double hell that way. Arooj wants motherly
love from Mehreen and in return, she will give her the
cruelty of a mother in law. Will you not call me mom now? I cannot even think that, you are my mom and
you are my dad. Yes we are your parents. So then what are you sad for? Wasai? Yes, Madam? Wasai, where is Arooj? I haven’t seen her for so long. Madam, Madam Jr is in her room. Okay, make soup for Arooj. Okay Madam. I don’t know what is
wrong with this girl? What is she thinking? My doll is here, hmm? My child, why don’t you take care of yourself? You have to take extra care
of yourself in these days. Yes, Aunt. And yes, stay away from Mehreen, taking tension these days
is not good for the baby. Come on, make soup for her. Wasai, why does she hate
aunt Mehreen so much? Madam Jr, you have now started
to defend Madam Sr, she has hated her
since the beginning. What is it? Is everything okay, you never thought this earlier? I guess I didn’t even know it earlier,
Wasai, but now I think Aunt Mehreen is absolutely right and everyone else is wrong. Everyone else is actually wrong. What do you mean? No, nothing, I just randomly said it. I will make soup for you. Yes, You go make soup, I will go check on Aunt meanwhile. Okay Madam Jr. Go, go Madam Jr, that’s how mother’s love is. How madam was showering
so much love on Madam Jr, though she is the actual enemy. You? What are you doing in my
room at this time? Arooj, wait, listen to me. What is she doing here? She even has the audacity
to come in my room, I will go see her. Arooj? Arooj? Stop. What were you doing in
my room right now? I was just randomly… Randomly what? I thought that… What did you think? That Mehreen must be
sleeping right now and you can strangle
her to death right now, that is what you thought, right? No, I cannot even imagine this. Oh please, let it be, girl, fool someone else. It’s not that. That’s how it is, else, you never came to my
room like this ever before. I used to come to your room. Yes, you used to, only when I would call you. Else, you never came so silently. What happened now, Mehreen? Why are you always shouting
at the poor girl? After all, what is her fault? What has she done to you? Look at her condition, don’t you know her condition? Aunt, it’s not her fault, it was my fault I shouldn’t have done that. Now you tell me, Salman? Has Arooj done the right thing? Mom, you should be happy she considers you her mother, every mother-in-law dreams of
having such a daughter-in-law. I don’t see such nightmares, that anyone can just come
up and call me Mom. I am just your mother and I have no relationship with
anyone in this world except you, it’s just Salman and his mother. Okay, don’t tense yourself, there is nothing like that. That is how it is Salman. okay fine, I will talk to her, you relax. Yes, please, go and make her understand. Okay I will. Don’t say anything because there is no use
in saying anything, I am a mother in law for you, like you consider me your mother, you are a very happy-go-lucky,
lovely girl but I have been noticing for a few days that you have become very dull, I can feel your pain, take care of yourself and listen, stay happy. Madam Jr, may I come in? Come in, Wasai. What is it? Why are you looking at me like this? I am thinking that you are in such complication. Madam Sr scolded you so much and you couldn’t say anything. You are right, this feeling is like that. Do you know, since I have found out that Aunt Mehreen is my mother, even if she scolds me, I don’t feel bad for anything, in fact, I feel like, like she is talking to me. But the sad part is, Madam Jr, this can’t be told to her. Hmm, you are right. Mehreen never cares
about Arooj at all, she never has mercy on her, we have to keep this
secret as a secret. Nature has brought
me so much closer, Wasai, look, me getting married into this house, and looking at that
picture in your room, it changed my life. You are right. Hey, Wasai, we had to go to the doctor, look, I forgot. Okay then, come. Wait, I will go get my bag. Picture? May God have mercy
on you, Madam Jr. Wasai can only pray for you. Nature has brought me
so much closer, Wasai, look, me getting married i
nto this house, and looking at that picture
in your room, it changed my life. You are right. What did I just hear? What is going on in this house? What secret is Arooj hiding? What picture were both
of them talking about?
