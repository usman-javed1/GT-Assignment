Did aunty go to sleep? No. she is crying. She is crying? I will see. 
Stop. There is no need for you 
to go there. Why? Because mama is crying 
because of you. You gave her sorrow. What did I do? I didn’t give her any sorrow. You are absolutely right, 
you didn’t do anything. It is all my fault that I listened to you, and 
I was disobedient to my mother, and I came to get you. So if you had not come, 
how would I have come home? How would I know? I only know that mama is depressed. Now move out of my way, before I get angry further. And yes, in future no need to make 
useless wishes. I am sorry, Urooj. What for? I was in a bad mood last night, 
and I… It is okay. You are getting late, I will ask Wasai to serve breakfast. I will not have breakfast. Why? I am getting late for the office, 
I have to go. Okay, I will get a little late 
in coming from the office. I have some work. Okay. Take care of yourself. You too. See you. Stop it, why are you changing 
all the channels. Hey, one minute. Do you want to watch the match? Hey… come, child. Come. 
Come, have a seat. Did I disturb you two? No child, what are you saying? You are my daughter-in-law… the daughter-in-law of this home. 
This is your home, child. Actually, Salman is not at home, 
he has gone for some work. So I was getting bored, so I thought I would come over
to you people. You did good. Salman took the party that has come
from Singapore for dinner. Dinner reminds me, child, invite your parents her. 
Invite them for dinner. Yes, I will have a good chat with Mr. Shoaib,
 he is a really good man. Absolutely. Okay fine, I will inform papa. But child, Mehreen shouldn’t find out 
about this dinner at all, or else she will do what 
she did on the last dinner. Don’t do that, Shaista, tell her. You be quiet. You don’t know. 
I know how to deal with her. Aunt, think about it. What if, something goes wrong and we have to face worries. Child, nothing will happen and after all,
it is the matter of our home’s respect. Principally, Mehreen should have 
invited your parents, but she didn’t do it, 
so I am doing it. It is their right, child. Anyway, leave these things,
we are having coffee. What will you have, tell me? I will have tea. Wasai, bring tea for little madam. Wasai. Hey, younger madam, you. If you had some work,
you should have called me. What do you want? Wasai, I want to explain something to you. You come here. Yes, younger madam. You know, today my mama and papa are 
coming for dinner. Yes, yes, I know. You don’t worry. I will cook everything well. I know that Wasai, but aunt Mehreen shouldn’t find out 
for whom this food is being made for. But if elder madam asks, 
what will I say to her? So you tell her that 
aunt has asked you, she will take care of the rest. Fine, younger madam, as you order. Wasai, be careful, 
nothing should go wrong. Yes, younger madam, don’t worry. Fine. Wasai, why are you making so much arrangement? Where is everyone? They are all waiting for the guests outside. Guests? Who are the guests, Wasai? That…them… Naseema, please have a seat. Please, start. We are really lucky that 
we found people like you and a son-in-law like Salman. We didn’t have a son, but we found a son in the form 
of our son-in-law. Listen, Salman is only your son-in-law, 
and that is it. Don’t try to consider him your son. Just like the daughter-in-law 
is like a daughter, the same way the son-in-law 
is like a son. You have really weird thinking. I will not tolerate anything like this 
about Salman in future. Salman is only my son, do you people understand? Excuse me. Mom, what is this? Does anyone behave like this 
with guests? You don’t teach me. Those people want to snatch
 you from me and that Urooj is part of this as well. Mom, there is nothing like that. I am your son and I will stay yours, no one can snatch me from you. Salman, you don’t know that 
Urooj’s cunningness. She invited her family without 
informing me. Mom, she had already told me this,
I knew it, already. See. Did you see? That Urooj considers you 
and me separate. They want to create distances 
between us. There is nothing like that. That’s how it is. Okay fine, leave it, 
let’s have dinner. I don’t want to have dinner. You won’t have dinner?
No. Fine, then. Okay. 
I won’t eat either. What is this childish behavior, Salman? You always blackmail me like this. Okay fine, let’s go, we will have dinner. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please start. Uncle, you start. You have it, I will also eat. I will eat, you start, please. Aunty, please start. Urooj, serve food to aunty. There is a limit to everything. Now there is no respect for guests 
in this home even. You are even saying this knowing 
Mehreen’s mental condition. But they didn’t know. They got insulted. Then you tell me, what should be done? Will the insult that Urooj’s parents faced 
be turned back with me telling you? I don’t know what they would think 
about us. Yes, I too am sad about this because
their host was their daughter Urooj, and her parents were degraded 
in front of her. That’s what I am saying to you. We are helpless. If someone can do something 
in this situation, then it is Salman. He will have to act smart, so that he can carefully take 
both families together. Salman. Has Mehreen left Salman capable 
of anything? Daughters lie and make 
their parents feel good. Hey, not at all. Did you not see how nicely brother Idrees and 
sister-in-law Shaista met us with. Urooj was telling me that 
they really love her. The woman my daughter lives with, she doesn’t love her, right? Master, mothers-in-law everywhere, 
are mothers-in-law. Did you not see? She came back 
in a little while. Now you will try to convince me
 by saying that Mehreen is not bad at heart. She is just upset. Salman married out of his liking. May God keep my daughter happy. I am so helpless. You think good for every child, so your daughter will not be 
done wrong to. Aunty didn’t do right at all. She had an insulting behavior 
with my parents. Urooj, she is my mama, that is why she is so possessive for me. All parents are possessive 
for their children, Salman. I know. But what can I do? I am her only child. That is why she is so possessive for me. The ones who have been insulted
 are my parents. And just like you are the only child 
of your parents, just like that, I am the only daughter 
of my parents. I understand this, 
I completely understand. Look Urooj, even aunt hasn’t called me her son
in front of mama, she minds it. I am surprised that what sort of love does 
aunty have for you. That she cannot tolerate 
your love for anyone else. This is totally abnormal, Salman. Whatever happened last night, after that I have made a decision. What decision? In future, Urooj’s family will never 
come to our home. What do you mean they won’t come 
to our home? How is this possible? It can happen the same way I am saying it. Look mama, they are Urooj’s parents, they will surely come to meet her. I told you, they won’t come, 
so they won’t come. You cannot do this, aunty. I have not told you to not go, you surely go. But hear one more thing, after today, Salman too will never go 
to meet your family. It is so weird, my son, my son. How is this possible that 
you are also their daughter, and my son can also be their son. Look mama…
That’s it, I have said what I had to say. Aunt Mehreen, always keep 
an eye on me, What I am doing?
 Where I am going? what am I eating? 
what am I drinking? Meaning, she spies on you? Mama, I am Salman’s choice and aunty really loves Salman. She loves him like crazy. Salman is only your son-in-law, 
and that is it. Don’t try to consider him your son. Just like the daughter-in-law 
is like a daughter, the same way the son-in-law 
is like a son. You have really weird thinking. I will not tolerate anything like this 
about Salman in future. Salman is only my son. Master, tea. You don’t worry, God will make it all fine, because in the eyes of God, the level of daughters is really high. He also loves daughters a lot, so He puts them in a test, and then Master, it is God who takes you out of the test. 
You will also see that our Urooj will come out 
of this test, successful. I hope so. Where has my life come to. There is no one to speak for me. Not even Salman. The person who married me out of love, he doesn’t say anything 
on his mother’s injustice. God help me. I have no way to go now. Where did Urooj go? Urooj. Urooj. 
Yes? Why are you sleeping here? I don’t know, I slept sitting here. Come on, get up. Come upstairs and rest. Greetings, mama. Greetings. How are you? Are you fine? 
Are you okay? Child, I am fine, 
but your father is not fine. All okay? What happened to papa? He came from school and
 he felt dizzy and fell. So, did you take him to the doctor? No, his friend’s son came, 
doctor Faizan. So what is brother Faiza saying? Faizan is saying that they will have 
to admit your father for one day. But your father said no. He really misses you, 
you please come to meet him. God be kind. Okay, don’t worry, tell papa I am coming to him. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Aunty, I have to go to my home. Your home? I think you are at your home. I have to go to my papa’s home. Why? Suddenly? Like this? He is not well. So, he must be at the hospital. No, he is at home right now. Okay, so he is not that seriously ill. He is missing me. 
I have to go to my home. How will you go? You send me with the driver. How can a newlywed bride 
go alone like this? Then how will I go? You will not go. My father is missing me,
I will have to go. Don’t step out of this home. Do you understand? I will go. Master. No. 
A little. I told you there is no need for this. How is there no need? Is Dr. Faizan mad that he gave you 
a drip for no reason? Hey, I am her uncle. He gave me the drip out of love. Wow. Wow. You get a drip out of love too? I am hearing this for the first time. 
Mama, do you see? Your father is really careless. He doesn’t eat food and nor does 
he take care of himself. Okay, till the time your drip ends, 
I will bring soup for you. You are here, child,
think I am fine. Leave the soup. But you will still have to drink soup. Mama, you make papa eat the apple and if he doesn’t eat, then tell me. Naseema, now that she has come, 
my heart is at peace. May God protect my daughter. Amen. Come on, now that your daughter has told you,
you will have to eat the apple. Yes. How can a newlywed bride 
go alone like this? Then how will I go? You will not go. My father is missing me, 
I will have to go. Don’t step out of this home. Do you understand? Thank you. I was about to call you. Salman, papa is not well. Where are you? I came to papa’s place. Okay, you did good. Okay tell me, is uncle fine now? Yes, he is a little better right now, but he is still getting a drip. How did you go there? I came in an auto. In a rickshaw? You should have taken the car. The car was not at home. I had to come quickly, 
so I took a rickshaw. Okay, you do one thing, take lots of care of uncle. I am getting free from the office 
in a little bit, I will come and meet uncle 
and I will also pick you. Okay, goodbye. Goodbye.
