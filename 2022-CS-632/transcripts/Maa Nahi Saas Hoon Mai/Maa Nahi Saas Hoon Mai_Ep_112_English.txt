The situation we are going through, we surely have to steal happiness and getting a job in situation is 
no less than any happiness. you are right Arooj, 
thank God. What do we have to be happy about, 
and what we don’t have to be happy about, at times a person is unable to 
differentiate between this. When a person suffers at 
the hands of the situation, then they even forget 
how to respect. But you have brought me up 
in tough conditions, papa. No matter how the condition, I cannot forget respect. Anyway, leave it, 
what are you talking about? Here you go. Have sweets. Yes, give it to me. Mama, sweets? That’s it, now we have to move on in life. For ourselves. For Areej. Everything will be fine. Yes, mama, I got an advance salary. I have kept the money 
in the cupboard. I have kept some money separately, we might need them. I will go give sweets to mama. May God protect her from 
the evil eye, and always keep her happy. Money has a lot of power. I mean, money itself is a big power. What do you think? We cannot argue on this, 
you are 100% correct. By the way, now those people don’t even
have money to buy poison. The old man is already injured, and even if he was not injured, he was not capable 
to earn money. No, no, no, Salman, 
don’t think this at all. He is a big strength for 
Arooj right now, and till the time a person has 
their own around them, they don’t fall weak. The old man has good luck, he got saved at my hands that day. That’s fine, but we shouldn’t 
take them easy. You understand me, right? Yes. By the way, I met aunt Mehreen, 
I forgot to tell you. So? Nothing, the same emotional drama, 
emotional talk. I didn’t give her a lot of importance. She is a really cunning woman. 
Really cunning. I feel Arooj gave her a lesson 
and sent her. No, issues, both mother and daughter will 
come in a few days and apologize to us. You couldn’t recognize 
these eyes, right? I went crazy crying 
in your memory. I am your mother. I have brought you up. I have done your upbringing. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything. But I want to talk to you Salman. I want to talk. I didn’t bring you up like this, that you stop caring about people. And that you only become 
the slave of your stubbornness. I didn’t bring you up like this. Why are you disturbing me? Huh? Disturb? We are disturbing you? You have disturbed all of us, Salman. Greetings sir. Is Nasir there? Yes, sir, he is in his room.
Okay. Ansa, don’t worry. I will talk to Mr. Nasir today and I have full hopes that 
he will appoint you. Because I know your accounts
 experience, we have worked together. So I hope that he will ask you 
to join from this month. Thank you, madam. 
I am really needy. I understand and I will try my best that 
you join us from this month. Okay, madam.
Thank you so much. Sister in law Arooj is taking care
of the new appointments, if she has given an approval then 
you can join from tomorrow. Thank you sir. 
You are welcome. You can leave. What have you done? Salman, come, 
we will sit and talk. What is Arooj doing in your office? What is Arooj doing in your office?
Answer me. Sure. She is my sister in law. Whatever relation you had with 
her was because of me. Now my relation is no more, then 
what relation are you living up to? Salman, you are being emotional
 for no reason. The situation is not that bad, 
that you don’t have a way to go back. Who wants to go back? Huh? And what do you think? 
Whatever happened is just time pass? Everything will be fine as earlier? There is just one relation left 
between me and Arooj and that is enmity. Whoever will support her 
will be my enemy. How can you doubt my friendship,
man? I am surely doubting you. You are supporting my enemy and
 I don’t even doubt your friendship. there is nothing like that, Salman? Really? Then come fire her. Fire her. I cannot do that. I cannot do injustice with 
anyone else because of you. I am really sorry for that. I think you are forgetting 
who you are saying no to. I know. You don’t know. 
You don’t know at all. Whatever I do with
 Arooj is separate, but you have no idea what I can do with you. Are you threatening me, Salman? Absolutely. Is this you, Salman? My childhood friend? You are threatening me? All relations are based on loss 
and benefit. Here no one belongs to anyone. There is still time, 
think about it or else… Or else what will you do? This office of yours works 
on my tenders. I will take back all the tenders 
and you will fall to the ground. Salman, maybe the company 
will stand up again, but the way you have fallen 
from my eyes today, maybe you will never be 
able to get up. You can do what you want. Sister in law Arooj will do 
a job here. That’s the way to leave. It will cost you a lot. It will cost you a lot. By the way, 
how was her interview? So, so, but she was not up to 
the requirements of the company, so I rejected her. What do you mean, 
you rejected her? Are you crazy? You rejected such a pretty girl? Oh hello, my dear friend Salman Waqar. This company doesn’t need 
pretty and beautiful girls. It needs intelligent and 
skilful girls. After all, I have already hired 
someone for this post. But this girl, what is her name? Arooj. She is very, very, educated and
sincere to her work. But I am sorry. You call Arooj tomorrow. I am telling you, your business will grow 
because of Arooj. Call her tomorrow. If you take Areej from here, 
I will kill you. You will kill me? Kill me. Kill me. Shoot. Why don’t you shoot? 
Murder me. Tell Areej that a mother sacrificed her life 
for her daughter. Shoot. Come on, shoot. Hey, leave it. 
Coward. How will you shoot someone? It will cost you a lot to take Areej. I am not a businessperson 
like you people, that I will account for cheap 
and expensive. I am a mother. If you take Areej from here, 
you will have to face a lot of loss. I will divorce you. You can do what you want. Brother Nasir, is everything fine? Is the file complete, sister in law? Yes. Why don’t you understand, Naseema, they are really dangerous and 
powerful people. We cannot go to war with them. They will make our life hell 
in this city. What do you think? Will they let any ease come 
in Arooj’s life? Never. Never, Naseema. Never. So, Master, should we sit at home out 
of their fear? Should we leave this city and go? When we cannot go to war 
with them, then what is the harm in sitting at 
home and leaving the city and going? They will make my daughter’s life
tougher, than tough. Master, the one who has no one, God is with them. You don’t lose hope. Just pray to God that HE protects us from 
the evil of the enemy. I will go make soup for you. When you cannot handle the bike, then why do you bring it on 
the road at this age? Do you see, 
you put a dent in my car? You are right, Salman. It is my fault. You want to embarrass me 
by saying all this, right? Like it is all my fault and 
you didn’t do anything. That’s how it is, right? No, there is nothing like that, 
I came to talk to you. When I have told you that 
I don’t want to talk to you, then why are you after me
like a beggar? Go from here. You are right, the father of the girl is a beggar 
in front of a rich son in law. Don’t speak too many dialogues 
in front of me. Guards, pick up his bike and 
take it into custody. Till the time he doesn’t pay up, 
he will not get his bike. Oh my God, keep my daughter in 
Your protection. Protect her, my Lord. Make things easy for her. Make it easy for her. I have ruined it? How dare you say something
so useless to me? Actually, Areej is also with you, so Arooj is crying continuously. Have mercy on her. There is still time. Leave from here, or else I will have
 the guard drag you out. Don’t do that. My daughter will go mad. Really? So, she is your daughter? With what relation? You can say anything you want, but don’t separate Areej and Arooj
from you. Please. Don’t try to dictate me. Get out of here. She is my sister in law. Whatever relation you had with her
was because of me. Now my relation is no more, then, 
what relation are you living up to? Salman, you are being emotional 
for no reason. The situation is not that bad, that
 you don’t have a way to go back. Who wants to go back? Huh? And what do you think? Whatever
 happened is just time pass? Everything will be fine as earlier? There is just one relation left 
between me and Arooj and that is enmity. Whoever will support her 
will be my enemy. How can you doubt my friendship, 
man? I am surely doubting you. You are supporting my enemy and
I don’t even doubt your friendship. there is nothing like that,
Salman? Really? Then come fire her. Fire her. I cannot do that. I cannot do injustice with 
anyone else because of you. I am really sorry for that. Man, Salman, you don’t like it, right? I feel you want to worry them more. Don’t you and mom want this? Forget me, son, but it is Shaista’s dream that 
we ruin Mehreen and Arooj. Now see how both of them 
are staying with Master. What should we do? I want to ruin Arooj. Look son, it is not easy to reach the queen bee. In fact, think that it is impossible. The bees that love the queen always
have a protective circle around her. Even if they lose their life in this. So what is done, then? Smoke. Smoke, son. Spread so much smoke, that the bees are unable to see and they start worrying 
about themselves. I want to single out the queen bee. Yes, now you get it. Are you threatening me, Salman? Absolutely. Is this you, Salman? My childhood friend? You are threatening me? All relations are based on loss 
and benefit. Here no one belongs to anyone. There is still time, 
think about it or else… Or else what will you do? This office of yours works 
on my tenders. I will take back all the tenders and
you will fall to the ground. Salman, maybe the company 
will stand up again, but the way you have fallen 
from my eyes today, maybe you will never be
able to get up. You can do what you want. Sister-in-law, Arooj will do a job here. That’s the way to leave. Don’t worry, my sister. No matter how long the days
of difficulty are, the evening of comfort surely comes. Master, I too have complete faith. Good times will surely come.
