You have put a crack 
in my home. I didn’t know. Idrees told me that
he divorced his wife, he is single. and you believed him? If a man cries and asks
a woman for sympathy, then the woman becomes helpless. I thought there is a man troubled
by circumstances, a worn-out person,
who needs support. This has nothing to do
with my win or loss. She is your second wife,
keep her with respect, make your home. And also let me live
my life peacefully. So, then, victory is yours, right? What is wrong younger madam? Is everything fine? I hope everything will be
fine really soon. I have lived all my life
in worries, son and now this adventure
of your father. Dad didn’t do anything. Whatever has been done has been
done by Arooj. I apologize to you on her behalf. Why do you apologize, son? The one who did all this
should apologize. She will. She surely will. That too by pleading you. Today I have found out how big a
support is a young son for his mother. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. It is locked. Excuse me.
Yes, madam? Why is this home locked? These people have left
the home and gone. They have gone? When? Their things just left. Oh, can you tell me where
these people went? I know nothing about this. Okay fine, thank you.
Thank you. They left? Did you not have shame in putting
allegation on a man as old as your father. Uncle got married and getting married is not a sin. Arooj, don’t talk senseless things
in front of me, I am telling you. I didn’t say anything senseless. Arooj, I am warning you, stop all this or
you will see the worst in me. I am speaking the truth, Salman. I met her myself, I went to her home.
I called her here. If you talk to her,
she will tell you everything… Stop your nonsense. You say you are honest, right? Yes. Then fine, you have till the evening
to prove yourself or else you will apologize to dad
in front of everyone. Will you not talk about anything,
wife of mine? Can you call me your wife
in front of people. Hey, try and understand. Why do I understand every time? And you only make me understand. Understand this.
Understand that. Why don’t you understand yourself,
Idrees? These wedding functions, orchestra,
music, wedding, reception, this is done to announce the wedding,
that both of us are husband and wife. But… but nothing like this was done
when it was my turn, Idrees and when could it done? This wedding is a secret wedding. Proving it is impossible. You have the wedding papers, right? That is also my doing or else you were saying that what is
the need of putting this in writing? It is useless. Okay, I am sorry. Forgive me. Okay, do one thing, keep this cheque
for two hundred thousand. Get what you want, okay? This is less. Hey, so you will get more. Idress I am not talking
about money. I… I don’t want to keep our wedding
a secret now. Arooj taught you this lesson, right? First you promise me, you will
stay away from her. And no one should find out
this new address, your number should also be new. In return, I promise you, that once I get  my hands on
this business and properties, after that, I will get rid of Shaista, it will just me you and me. Yes. Are you speaking the truth? Yes, I am speaking the truth. Even if I die, still your anger
will not be reduced. What is wrong with you? God forbid,
What nonsense are you speaking? Look, I have made a promise. At least now get me
a good cup of tea. Yes, yes, I will make tea
for you myself and bring it. Okay. What did I do? I brought the truth
in front of everyone. Why do you not like it this much? You have attacked my position
in this home, you will have to pay the price for it.
Be quiet. Right now, you are not in
a position to threaten me. And as much as you have
conspired against me, I have paid the price for it
a long time back. I am only taking revenge from you. How many times did I tell you not to try to poison my life
with Salman? But sadly, despite me asking you a thousand times,
you didn’t listen to me once. She is under control now. Now I will teach Arooj a lesson that
she will go around crying. Arooj, this is something bad
that the woman did. Shanzay, what can I say now? Hey, she got such a good opportunity
to get her right, she disappeared. God knows where she went, but she left me in difficulty. Salman is really upset
with me anyway, now I will become a criminal
in front of him. Okay, you be strong.
Don’t worry. If you want, can I talk to
brother Salman? After all, I know everything
about this wedding. What do you mean?
Will you talk to Salman? What is wrong, Shanzay? He considers me a liar, then how can he believe
what my friend said. Arooj, all this is your fault. When you had found out
the truth about uncle Idrees, then you should have told
brother Salman first. I tried to help uncle and instead
I got stuck in it myself. Anyway, I don’t know
what will happen. Okay, I will call you, right now I don’t understand
anything. Goodbye. Okay take care, then tell me
what happened. Okay, bye. What has she done. I have to see all that is
written in my fate. Where do I find this aunt Mussarat? I searched for you everywhere. Why did you leave the home
and go? I had told you to wait,
you left and went away. You know, everyone is calling me
a liar at home, that I am lying and no one came. You should have cared
about my respect a little. I was doing everything
for your good and… Yes, Shanzay. I have found Mussarat,
I am talking to her. I will call you back. I… This wedding is a secret wedding. Proving it is impossible. You have the wedding papers, right? That is also my doing or else you were saying that what is
the need of putting this in writing? It is useless. Okay, I am sorry. Forgive me. Okay, do one thing, keep this cheque
for two hundred thousand. Get what you want, okay? This is less. Hey, so you will get more. Idress I am not talking
about money. I… I don’t want to keep our wedding
a secret now. Arooj taught you this lesson, right? First you promise me,
you will stay away from her. And no one should find out
this new address, your number should also be new. In return, I promise you, that once I get  my hands on
this business and properties, after that, I will get rid of Shaista,
it will just me you and me. Yes. I searched for you everywhere. Why did you leave the home
and go? I had told you to wait,
you left and went away. You know, everyone is calling me
a liar at home, that I am lying and no one came. You should have cared
about my respect a little. I was doing everything
for your good and… Yes, Shanzay. I have found Musarat,
I am talking to her. I will call you back. Dad, forget this now. Whatever Arooj did was
absolutely wrong and I will surely punish her for it. I promise you. But my position got spoiled
in front of your mother. Mom, wouldn’t have believed her. Arooj has really hurt me a lot, son. That too such an allegation
at this age.
