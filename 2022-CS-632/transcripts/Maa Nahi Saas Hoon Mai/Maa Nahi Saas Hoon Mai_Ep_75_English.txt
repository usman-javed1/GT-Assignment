Arooj. Huh? What happened? 
Why are you so scared? I feel now me and Areej 
are not safe in this home. I am really scared. Since you found 
out about yourself, you have a unknown 
fear inside you. This is not an unknown fear, I know the character 
of this fear well. But I don’t understand 
what is the reason behind it. Are you talking about aunt? Did you not see aunt’s 
behaviour today? She was reacting in 
such a weird manner. I have started to be afraid of her. Don’t worry, everything will be fine. j Was this so? Then fine, if papa had this dream, then we will surely 
setup a mill there. But this states that the mill that was being made was
 in Areej’s name. it was Areej textile. Who is this Areej? Why don’t I know about this? Actually son, your mama, sister in law
 really liked this name. There is nothing else about it. Are you sure? Yes, but don’t mention 
this in front of her, because then
 she misses late Waqar and she starts getting unwell. You understand what 
I am saying son? Is everything fine, Salman? Uncle, what is all this? I am looking at some
 old documents and these are some property files, all of these are in the name of Areej. Who is she? I had told you, Mehreen liked the name… How can so much happen
 on her liking a name and we don’t know about it. Actually, son, the thing is, I don’t know about this. Late Waqar used to take 
care of everything. Whatever he did 
would be the final word, I never even questioned him. If you ask me honestly, I had never even thought that I would have to 
live without my brother and I would have to take care
 of this entire business. But maybe that’s 
what God willed. Son, you got stuck in the files. I never even opened
 and saw them. I cannot see. This has signatures of 
late Waqar in them. My heart starts to explode. What do I do? She turned out to be so cunning. What did she name her child? Areej. Slowly and gradually, she wants to take over everything. For us, the danger is increasing 
every passing moment. You are right. Where are you going? No where, I will come. Shaista, I am scared of you. Don’t do anything in your emotions, that things become easier for Arooj. I have become emotional Idrees, but don’t worry, I am not stupid. It is Waqar’s attachment, his daughter’s attachment, so don’t sell the land. So I didn’t sell it and till Salman grew up, I took care of the factory. Waqar must have thought that putting everything 
in Areej’s name will make us dependent on her. But still everything belongs to us. What are you saying, Shaista? Waqar was my younger brother, and Areej is my niece. Really? But your younger brother never treated you like a brother. He always kept you as his employee. I have no sorrow about this. Because late Waqar setup
 the whole business and empire, not me. Anyway, Mehreen did only one good 
thing throughout her life that she considered our 
son Salman her own. Salman, you have gotten 
in the wrong search, son. You have no idea, you are moving towards an explosive
 tunnel, without any safety measures. Trying to untangle this string, you will get tangled badly. The enemy’s hands 
will become stronger. yes, Idrees. Shaista, I am really confused, I am really worried. Why? What happened Idrees? I feel we will get stuck in a big worry. What do you mean? Look Idrees, 
I am already really worried. Don’t worry my heart further, tell me quickly what happened? Salman is after the name Areej. Okay, that’s how it is. So, then? I feel he has a doubt in his heart and he will know the secret. No. No. No, Idrees, if this happens, everything will be over. It will all be over. We will not be left with anything. And look at our bad luck that this Areej came in 
our life as Arooj. That is what I think too, I never heard of something like this. Such coincidences only
 happen in dramas, and here it has happened with us. Our life will become a drama soon. That’s why, Idrees. That’s why I am ready to go to any extreme. But this Arooj has good luck, that she survives everything. You will not do anything. What do you mean? Now you will leave everything
 to the situation? No, no. Listen to me, you always talk. You just talk, listen to me. Okay, tell me. You will not do anything now. I will talk to the lawyer about how we handle
 the matters of property. Okay? You will not do anything. I will put the phone down now. Okay? But I need the rights as Waqar 
to work independently. Yes, those became yours
 automatically after Waqar’s death, right? No, that’s not true, Shaista. The board directors decide
 this or the board head. And who is the head of the board? After Waqar, the head of the board is Mehreen, if she signs then I will automatically get the rights. Fine, don’t worry. Mehreen is mentally 
disabled anyway. It won’t be an issue to
 get a signature from her. I will get the signatures from her. Really? Is that true? Wait. So here you go. We have named her Areej. And we want that you make Areej wear this bracelet. We want that you bring her up. Me? How will I be able to 
take care of her. Salman… No one cares more than you no one can bring her 
up better than you. What is this? I have made soup for you. I don’t want to eat or 
drink anything you make. Okay. You drink it with your own hands, I just made it. I told you, I don’t want to drink it. You will have to drink it and that too for ten days, because this is your diet plan. You are just saying 
what you want to, you don’t care about anything I say? I care. I care about your health, that is why I am asking you. Why do you care? Let me die. Please aunty, don’t say these things. You have to live for Salman’s sake,
 for Areej’s sake. Sit, Wasai. Hey, you sat on the floor again. Don’t sit on the floor
 in front of me. You are my elder. Come on, come sit up. Madam saw me sitting 
with you on the sofa once, she scolded me a lot. Wasai, you sit up. I am fine here. Wasai, I told you to get up and
 sit here with me. Come. If madam sees me… I will answer her. Come on. Tell me something, Wasai. Ask me, younger madam. What has happened to 
aunt’s behaviour? Why has she suddenly 
started to hate me so much? Younger madam, I have told you the 
entire incident. Still you don’t get it? I don’t understand, Wasai, what is the reason for
 this behaviour of hers. First, an attempt was
 made on my life, after that, she tried to 
play with my child’s life. Why is she doing all this? This matter of wealth is really bad. It makes you do everything. I don’t understand. Meaning, this home this wealth, this entire business 
belonged to elder sir. And on your birth, elder sir had put everything
 in your name. What are you saying, Wasai? I am right, younger madam. All this is yours. You are the owner of it. These are the papers 
of Waqar Ahmed’s entire wealth and his 
business ownership, and according to this, the owner of everything is late Mr. Waqar’s widow Mehreen and his daughter Areej. What are you saying, 
Mr. lawyer? Everything has been done in
 the name of Mehreen and Areej No, no, it can’t be But these documents have been 
made on the request of late Waqar And Idris knows that I am the legal 
advisor of the company And these papers 
were entrusted to me Madam I would like 
you to handle this Oh. So this is why she wants 
to remove me from her way. Meaning, she is dreaming of ruling this home. I will not let what you think happen. My beloved aunt, Oh, Areej. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. Grandma’s love. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. Hey, Areej. Wasai. Wasai. That’s it. That’s it. Wait Wasai, you won’t go anywhere. But elder madam has called me. I am telling you, sit down. Come to grandma’s arm. Come on. Come on. Come on. Grandma’s princess. Come in grandma’s arms. Come on. Come on. Grandma’s beloved. Mama’s life. Papa’s doll. She is papa’s princess. Did you see? She has gotten quiet. Yes. She doesn’t even know who is in her arms. But Areej recognizes the 
scent of motherhood well. You are right, younger madam. She is the mother of Areej’s mother, how will she not get
 the peace of motherhood. Now you can leave, Wasai. But Areej… I will take care of her. You go do your work in the kitchen. As you order me. I am really happy that the distances between you
 and mom have reduced. What did the doctor say? There is no danger, but they have said that we shouldn’t say anything in front of mom that stresses her. But I don’t understand that it was a happy occasion, then why did mom take stress? Did someone say something? No. Nothing like that happened. Tell me something. You knew mom really 
liked the name, Areej, right?
