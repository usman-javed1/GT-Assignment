[38.00] Urooj.
[41.48] Urooj, listen to me.
[45.68] I don’t want to hear anything.
[47.44] But I want to talk to you.
[57.16] I am sorry.
[61.64] Please, come sit in the car.
[106.16] Say what you want quickly,
[108.60] I want to get off at the roundabout.
[114.36] Urooj, there is nothing like 
you are thinking.
[117.68] Believe me you are the only girl 
in the world,
[121.04] in front of whom, I am helpless.
[131.16] The reason for being helpless.
[139.32] I love you.
[153.52] Urooj, look at me.
[162.20] Urooj, I am telling you, look at me.
[168.76] What are you doing?
[172.36] I am asking you.
[174.96] I want to marry you.
[179.80] Will you marry me?
[191.16] I cannot give you any answer 
for this question,
[195.56] my parents will decide this.
[200.64] Now stop the car.
[202.44] Urooj, listen…
Will you stop the car?
[207.80] Okay, I am stopping it.
[283.80] And I know rich people like you well.
[290.40] Who only want to impress girls 
by showing off their wealth.
[297.36] Will you marry me?
[304.20] I cannot give you any answer 
for this question,
[308.72] my parents will decide this.
[350.84] Elder madam,
[353.40] I have served food.
[355.72] Did you tell Mr. Salman 
that dinner is ready?
[358.20] Yes, I asked him,
[360.40] he is saying he is not in the mood to eat.
[364.68] Salman, knows I cannot have dinner 
without him.
[368.44] I will check on him myself.
[370.96] Sure.
[378.20] Salman.
[397.76] Salman,
[399.80] are you feeling okay?
[402.24] You didn’t even eat food.
[406.96] I am fine.
[410.44] There is surely something.
[412.84] Wont you even tell your mama?
[423.64] There is something wrong.
[427.44] Something has happened.
[429.56] Is all okay? Are you fine?
[433.00] What happened?
[442.96] Mama,
[445.76] I am in love.
[455.92] Love?
[458.96] Yes,
[460.68] I am in love.
[478.48] Salman,
[482.56] you are in love?
[485.24] How?
[521.40] Urooj, there is nothing like 
you are thinking.
[524.76] Believe me you are the only girl 
in the world,
[528.04] in front of whom, I am helpless.
[535.60] I love you.
[538.80] I want to marry you.
[543.60] Will you marry me?
[548.92] By the way,
[554.00] Salman doesn’t look that bad either.
[563.72] He is handsome.
[604.48] I had never even thought about this,
[611.12] that my son can also love someone.
[620.12] He can also love someone else 
other than me?
[629.04] This means that
[632.32] Salman can love someone else 
apart from me.
[662.04] Where is Mr. Salman?
[663.84] Little master is coming, madam.
[678.52] Good morning.
[682.04] Good morning.
[705.00] What is the matter mom?
[707.48] You seem in a bad mood.
[715.12] What you said last night has really 
worried me, Salman.
[727.44] Worried?
[732.76] Mom, your son is in love.
[741.80] You should be happy and 
you are worried.
[747.40] You will have a love marriage?
[753.88] I have only loved.
[756.52] You will get me married.
[762.84] Whoever that girl is,
[769.48] you will not marry her.
[778.08] This is my decision.
[781.56] Mom, look…
I told you.
[784.32] That’s it.
[819.72] Do you see, Mehreen?
[822.48] What happened? What did Mehreen do?
[825.16] She is saying she will not let 
Salman marry out of his liking.
[830.00] So why do you get upset?
[831.64] This is a matter between Mehreen
 and Salman..
[833.60] How is this a matter between 
Mehreen and Salman.
[837.36] If my son wants to marry out his liking,
[840.76] then who is Mehreen to stop him?
[843.00] His mother.
[844.36] I am his mother. 
Lower your voice.
[849.16] Why do you forget that Salman has been
 her child from the start.
[856.12] So will Mehreen make all the decisions
of Salman’s life?
[862.36] She has always done it and 
she will do it now too.
[869.24] I am going to the office, 
I am getting late.
[899.48] What are you thinking about, 
my love?
[906.24] Hello.
[911.40] When did you come?
[912.72] I have been here for a long time, 
where are you lost?
[916.16] Nothing man.
[918.08] I am really hurt.
[919.88] Who hurt my brother?
[922.72] Mama didn’t like me falling in love.
[925.96] She said no.
[928.36] All mothers do that,
[930.12] and then they agree themselves. 
Don’t worry.
[932.88] Mama is different. 
She is really stubborn.
[938.84] Are you sure she won’t agree?
[940.80] She won’t agree at all.
[942.96] There is nothing like that. She will agree
in a day or two, don’t worry.
[947.60] I hope what you are saying is true.
[950.88] Okay, look, the weather is so nice.
[953.20] Order coffee, we will chill a little. 
Fix your mood.
[957.64] Man, you know what the thing is?
[960.16] I cannot upset mama
[962.64] and I cannot even leave Urooj.
[965.04] What do I do, then?
[973.12] Okay, I will order the coffee.
[979.16] Hello.
[982.04] Two coffees, please. Thank you.
[990.00] I don’t understand anything.
[992.68] Relax. Relax a little.
[1038.12] Come sister. Come.
[1041.44] All okay?
[1044.12] You came to my home after a long time.
[1049.12] You had forgotten the way to my home.
[1051.92] Sit. Sit.
[1054.96] Hey, you don’t invite me,
[1058.56] I thought about you myself, 
that’s why I came.
[1063.88] Hey, it is your own home.
[1067.80] Come whenever you want.
[1070.48] When do I have time?
[1072.52] I get the proposal fixed for one girl,
[1074.44] so people are standing in line for another.
[1076.92] If I get this one married,
 the other is waiting.
[1080.44] Hey, you know well that I get the proposals 
fixed for all the children in the neighbourhood.
[1086.56] It is my responsibility.
[1089.12] I thought of your Urooj.
[1093.00] What is she doing nowadays?
[1094.80] You have a really pretty daughter.
[1097.24] She must have completed her 
education, right?
[1100.68] What do you think?
[1103.36] Do you want to marry her or not?
[1107.32] Right now, she wants to do a job,
[1111.60] and we don’t say no to her either.
[1114.24] Huh?
[1115.72] You will make your daughter do a job?
[1118.08] What are you saying?
[1120.32] It doesn’t take long for girls to grow up.
[1124.48] And what do you want her 
to do a job for?
[1127.52] Will you eat her earning all your life?
[1132.12] Sister, what are you saying?
[1135.68] What is my Urooj’s age right now?
[1139.68] When I get a reasonable proposal,
[1142.40] we will not say no.
[1144.12] Hey, a reasonable proposal is not 
hanging on the trees,
[1148.24] that you break it and bring it.
[1150.80] You have to search for it.
[1152.60] You have to go to four home.
[1155.24] You have to ask people.
[1157.96] Your shoes wear out,
[1159.84] that’s when you find a good proposal.
[1163.48] And I am here.
[1167.40] Listen to me,
[1169.24] I will tell you the best of proposals.
[1171.76] We will. We will.
[1174.28] When the time comes, 
we will take your service.
[1177.48] But sister, let the time come.
[1180.76] Time?
[1181.96] What time will come?
[1183.48] What time are you waiting for?
[1185.76] And time passes just like that,
 you won’t even know. Yes.
[1190.32] Okay. Okay. You see,
[1193.52] if you have a good proposal 
in your eyes,
[1196.52] then tell me.
[1199.92] Yes, yes, why not? 
She is my own daughter.
[1202.76] I will find the best of the best proposal
for my daughter.
[1209.44] Okay tell me something,
[1212.24] do you serve tea or water or not?
[1215.12] Bring me tea.
[1217.16] I will bring it. I will bring it.
[1218.88] Hey,
[1220.40] also get biscuits and samosas.
[1222.60] They are being made fresh 
in the corner shop,
[1224.48] send someone and get them.
[1226.40] Fine.
[1229.08] Hear one more thing, sister.
[1232.24] Now you have asked me 
for the proposal,
[1235.20] so we will have to visit.
[1236.92] It is not easy to go in a rickshaw.
[1240.12] I was saying,
[1243.04] also bring some advance money,
[1245.88] I will find a proposal soon.
[1248.16] Yes, yes, go. Go.
[1251.92] I understand. I will bring it.
[1264.72] Oh people today have become 
really miserly.
[1269.12] They don’t know how they should 
give money,
[1272.96] they think their work will be done for free.
That’s not how it works.
[1276.24] Will I do everyone’s work for free?
[1286.88] Mom, I am just asking you what 
objection do you have on this wedding?
[1291.44] I have no objection on you 
getting married,
[1294.16] but I don’t like you falling in love.
[1297.16] What are you saying?
[1299.72] I will marry the one I like, right?
[1303.44] You will surely get married Salman
[1305.84] but not with the girl you like,
[1309.80] you will get married to the girl I like.
[1312.92] Look mom,
[1314.20] if you meet her once, I am sure 
you will really like her.
[1317.48] I am telling you.
[1320.20] This will not happen.
[1322.48] What will not happen?
[1324.40] You won’t understand, Salman.
[1326.00] Then make me understand, 
I am listening.
[1327.48] Leave it. I said, leave it.
[1331.40] I will get you married to the girl I like,
[1334.32] it is my final decision. 
Understand?
[1341.04] Really?
[1342.96] Then fine,
[1345.64] also hear my decision.
[1349.80] If I get married,
[1352.04] then I will only marry Urooj
[1359.44] or else I will not marry anyone.
[1407.96] I have no objection on 
you getting married,
[1410.52] but I don’t like you falling in love.
[1414.80] You will surely get married Salman
[1417.08] but not with the girl you like,
[1419.52] you will get married to the girl I like.
[1424.32] You won’t understand, Salman.
[1425.96] Then make me understand, 
I am listening.
[1427.48] Leave it.
[1429.08] I said, leave it.
[1431.40] I will get you married to the girl I like,
[1434.24] it is my final decision. Understand?
[1455.48] You take one or two days off,
[1459.64] rest a little.
[1461.52] You will be fine.
[1464.72] No Naseema, there is a lot of work.
[1467.04] We are going to have exams soon.
[1473.68] Hey, you sit. I will see.
[1509.04] Yes?
[1512.12] Greetings.
[1513.80] Greetings.
[1515.44] I want to meet Mr. Shoaib.
[1517.96] Forgive me, son. 
I didn’t recognize you.
[1521.80] |My name is Salman.
[1523.32] You don’t know me, 
but Mr. Shoaib knows me.
[1526.68] Kindly let me meet him.
[1529.36] Mama.
[1532.24] Mama.
[1537.00] Who has come?
[1539.16] Child, there is some man, 
he is asking for your father.
[1546.24] Come. Come inside, child. Come.
[1590.64] Come, child. Come. 
This way.
[1602.40] You have a seat, 
I will bring master.
[1606.24] Yes, thank you.
[1638.60] Yes?
[1643.28] Hey, Mr. Salman, you?
[1645.48] You came to our modest home?
[1647.84] Greetings.
[1648.68] Greetings. Have a seat.
[1653.76] Seema arrange for tea quickly.
[1657.12] No there is no need for that.
[1659.32] You please have a seat.
[1667.04] Son, I had to come to thank you,
[1673.20] but I got unwell, that is why 
I couldn’t come.
[1677.60] Oh,
[1679.60] so how are you feeling now?
[1682.16] Now, I am fine, thank God.
[1686.04] Master doesn’t get tired of praising you.
[1690.68] Son, you did something so good.
[1693.96] You helped the children. 
Hey, no need to praise me,
[1700.04] this was my responsibility.
[1705.04] Actually, today I need your help.
[1714.00] Yes, go ahead Mr. Salman.
[1716.92] Actually, the thing is that
[1727.28] I like your daughter.
[1740.72] I have come with a proposal for her.
[1744.92] If you people don’t have 
an objection, then.
[1756.76] I have an objection.
[1760.60] How did you even dare to say this?
[1765.12] I think you are not in your senses, mister.
[1768.52] I am in my senses,
[1771.36] and I know well what I am saying.
[1774.36] You know nothing,
[1776.36] and coming like this you have insulted
my parents and me.
[1783.52] It would be better for you that 
you leave from this home right now.
[1789.24] Look, you listen…
[1790.36] Did you not hear what I said? 
You leave my home.
[1823.16] Urooj.
[1845.08] I have an objection.
[1848.84] How did you even dare to say this?
[1853.24] I think you are not in your senses, mister.
[1866.36] You know nothing,
[1868.48] and coming like this you have 
insulted my parents and me.
[1875.12] It would be better for you
[1877.12] that you leave from this home right now.
[1881.28] Look, you listen…
[1882.56] Did you not hear what I said? 
You leave my home.
[1910.92] When me and your papa were talking,
[1914.24] then what was the need 
for you to talk, Urooj?
[1917.68] So mama, there is a way to talk.
[1920.68] What does he think of us?
[1923.36] Look child,
[1924.84] proposals coming to the homes 
that have daughters, is nothing unique.
[1932.16] It is surely not something unique.
[1934.16] But the way he came.
[1936.20] The method he adopted,
[1938.04] it is something unique.
[1940.28] Hey, someone would be there 
in the family,
[1942.36] at least one family member, he should
have brought someone along.
[1946.88] Child, it is possible he has 
no one in his family.
[1952.88] There is no chance.
[1956.56] This is the problem of this man.
[1961.08] He only thinks about himself.
[1964.64] What do you mean?
[1966.60] Did you know him from earlier?
[1970.84] Mama, I know such boys well,
[1973.72] and his mention has given me
 a headache.
[1976.72] I am going to make tea, 
will you have it?
[1978.60] You have a seat, I will make
[1980.68] and cool your anger. 
Understand?
[1983.52] This is nothing new. 
You get proposals.
[1988.76] My beloved, mama, 
you are really innocent,
[1991.48] you know nothing.
[1993.04] Come on, you sit,
[1994.48] and Urooj will make you have 
strong tea, today.
[1997.00] Okay fine, go and make it.
[1999.60] First sit.
[2000.88] Okay fine, I will sit.
[2004.68] Make good tea and bring it. 
I will bring it.
[2011.08] God, give my daughter a good fate.
[2016.28] May she get a really good home, 
where she has importance.
[2071.64] You went to that girl’s home, 
that too alone?
[2074.12] So you tell me, 
what should I have done?
[2077.44] You surprise me, Salman.
[2079.44] I mean, you don’t think 
before doing anything.
[2083.52] No one was trying to understand me,
[2086.40] so I had to go alone.
[2088.04] No, so what happened?
Did you find her?
[2093.00] I know I made a mistake,
[2095.48] but I had no other option.
[2101.68] Why are you being so hasty?
[2103.84] Is she getting married? 
Has the groom come to her doorstep?
[2107.12] What would her family be thinking?
[2109.84] You ruined everything.
[2113.68] Tell me, did I come to you 
to hear all this?
[2117.68] There is no point of coming to me now.
[2119.68] In fact, there is no point 
in going to anyone.
[2121.64] You have hit your own foot 
with the axe,
[2123.60] you will not get her now. 
Enough!
[2128.80] Don’t say that.
[2132.08] Say anything, but not this.
[2136.88] I love Urooj a lot,
[2140.60] I will get her at any cost.
[2150.24] You will lose her because of 
this behavior.
[2158.52] All this happened cause of 
mama’s insistence.
[2163.32] Okay, come on, let’s go out somewhere. 
Please, man.
[2167.04] No man. 
Come on.
[2168.76] I am not in the mood, man. 
Come on, please, please, please.
[2184.80] Hmmm.
[2187.36] Sister-in-law Shaista, 
it smells really good.
[2190.48] Today, I have cooked everything 
my son likes.
[2193.44] Salman will be really happy today.
[2197.60] I have made all this food 
with a lot of love.
[2200.84] Anyone can cook,
 sister-in-law, Shaista.
[2204.08] The real thing is about choice.
[2207.36] I know well what my son likes.
[2210.72] You cooked it when I told you.
[2216.20] You are right. 
You told me.
[2221.44] Yes, Wasai?
[2222.84] Elder madam,
[2224.52] little master is not coming for food?
[2227.32] Why? Why is he not coming for food?
[2229.60] Did you not tell him that his mother
has gotten food he likes made?
[2233.12] Yes, I told him,
[2234.64] but he is saying he is not hungry.
[2237.84] Okay fine, I will take care of him myself.
[2257.80] I think you are not in your senses, mister.
[2261.44] and coming like this you have 
insulted my parents and me.
[2268.04] It would be better for you
[2270.04] that you leave from this home right now.
[2274.28] Look, you listen…
[2275.36] Did you not hear what I said? 
You leave my home.
[2288.48] Salman,
[2291.00] come on, have dinner, please.
[2294.48] I don’t want to eat.
[2296.00] Why?
[2297.48] Why don’t you want to eat?
[2302.28] What am I asking you.
