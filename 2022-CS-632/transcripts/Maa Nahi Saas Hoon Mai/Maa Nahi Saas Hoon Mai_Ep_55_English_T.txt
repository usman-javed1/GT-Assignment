[40.72] Aunt, you?
[45.00] Even trying to look for you 
is one hell of a trouble.
[50.92] Why were you looking for me?
[54.04] You are right,
[55.92] why was I attempting to do 
this useless task?
[70.48] If you have any work from me, 
then let me know.
[73.88] Work,
[75.60] yes, I do have a work from you.
[79.84] Yes?
[82.04] Do one thing,
[84.20] just disappear somewhere,
[93.60] get lost in a way that Salman cannot 
find you even if he wants to.
[103.96] No Aunt,
[113.56] I don’t want to get lost anymore.
[203.12] Look at me,
[205.72] she is a mother, my child,
[208.28] you don’t get upset with your Mom,
[214.36] if there is something, 
I will come along,
[217.76] I will talk to your mother and 
try to make her understand.
[229.92] My child I know you very well,
[233.60] you are a very happy and lovely girl
[244.84] but I have been noticing 
for a few days
[249.36] you have gone very dull.
[254.00] I can feel your pain.
[270.12] I went for some work.
[272.76] To the police station to file a report 
for missing child?
[278.20] What is your connection with a 
25-year-old case? Yeah?
[282.44] I am asking you something, 
who is that girl?
[286.00] I haven’t asked a very 
difficult question
[291.20] that you are thinking so deeply about.
[298.24] Why am I hiding it from everyone?
[305.72] All this is painful for me but...
[312.88] I don’t understand
[318.60] why have Mom asked me 
not to tell anyone?
[323.72] After all, what will anyone think
[328.96] about a missing child except feeling 
sad for them?
[344.32] My child, I and your mother went 
to the highway to visit an unwell friend.
[353.28] On our way back we heard the voice 
of a crying baby behind the bushes,
[358.92] we looked around us, 
but there was no one.
[364.48] Your Dad moved towards 
the bushes,
[368.48] he found you there,
[374.28] you were crying very badly 
over there,
[377.08] my heart exploded seeing you.
[390.72] Wasai?
[392.96] Wasai?
[394.68] yes, yes, yes, Madam Sr?
[396.76] Where has the daughter of 
Master Shoaib gone?
[399.52] Umm.
[403.24] This is my house, not a hotel
[406.04] that anyone can come when
 they want and leave when they want.
[414.72] Stop, stop, stop, girl?
[418.00] What has happened to her?
[419.36] Why didn’t she hear my voice?
[422.44] Don't worry Madam Sr, 
I will go see.
[428.92] This girl is losing her mind 
day by day.
[445.16] Stop Madam Jr, 
stop. Madam Jr?
[448.56] Madam?
[451.32] Madam Jr?
[452.84] Madam Jr?
[455.28] Madam Jr?
[457.00] Open the door Madam Jr.
[461.96] What should I do?
[463.88] I will call madam.
[478.32] If Arooj was our own biological 
daughter,
[485.00] would we still give her to such 
a mother-in-law?
[491.52] We found Arooj,
[493.48] we accepted her with all our heart,
[497.16] we didn’t have any daughter 
of our own.
[501.44] My child, I kept on roaming around in 
the neighborhood areas with you in my arms
[505.88] but no one could recognize you,
[510.16] I even went to the police station
[514.92] but there was no report filed 
of a lost child.
[546.44] Did you knock the door?
[547.92] Yes, yes, madam I have knocked 
multiple times,
[550.96] Madam Jr didn’t open the door, 
come quickly.
[556.16] Come, madam, 
come quickly Madam.
[581.84] Madam Jr is not opening the door.
[585.20] Arooj,
[586.64] Arooj my child,
[588.92] Arooj, open the door.
[591.88] Arooj?
[593.60] Arooj, open the door, my child.
[595.96] What is all this going on? Why are you
guys making so much noise?
[598.92] Mehreen, Arooj has locked herself 
in the room.
[624.32] what has happened, 
sister-in-law?
[626.28] What are you saying, Mehreen?
[628.64] She was so worried.
[630.92] She was very upset for the 
past 2 days.
[632.96] I don’t know how her mental condition
must be right now.
[635.48] I don’t know about her 
mental condition
[637.48] but Arooj will definitely 
make us mad,
[639.84] there is something or 
the other all the time,
[641.44] she keeps on doing something, 
this girl has made me fed up.
[646.64] This woman is so heartless.
[649.08] Arooj, my child?
[651.08] Arooj, my child,
[653.40] it’s me, open the door.
[656.92] Wasai, do one thing, 
keep on knocking
[659.68] till she opens the door, 
I will call Salman.
[664.00] Madam Jr?
[666.28] Madam Jr?
[668.48] Open the door, Madam Jr.
[723.00] Hello?
[733.44] Yes Aunt,
[741.20] yes I understand,
[749.08] don’t worry,
[754.52] I will talk to her.
[761.36] If God wills.
[766.88] Yes.
[870.92] How can life be lived with precaution
and by being careful all the time?
[889.08] Something or the other moves 
away from its place.
[898.36] If all the time will be spent doing this
then when will those moments come
[912.08] when life will be lived carefree 
with smiles?
[958.56] Arooj, my child,
[959.96] please open the door. Arooj?
[963.92] Wasai, my heart is sinking.
[965.72] Madam, don’t worry,
[968.84] God will make things right.
[971.60] Farooq, my child, break the door.
[994.08] Arooj, my child?
[1013.76] My child, what was this behavior?
[1019.88] I don’t expect such stupid act 
from you at all.
[1029.12] I am sorry, Aunt.
[1046.48] I couldn’t understand myself 
what I was doing.
[1050.92] My love, it is not important 
what you are doing,
[1055.60] what’s more important is 
why are you doing it?
[1059.92] I didn’t expect this from you, 
my child,
[1063.32] what was this weird act?
[1065.56] If there is a problem or any issue,
then tell me,
[1069.56] share it with me,
[1072.04] I might be able to help you somehow,
[1075.04] hmm?
[1087.08] no one can help me.
[1105.28] My foundation cannot change.
[1109.48] What are you saying, my child?
[1114.44] My child, Arooj?
[1117.84] What do you mean? 
Don’t say that.
[1124.84] Don’t you worry,
[1130.04] I won’t harm myself.
[1136.40] That is what I expect from you.
[1152.84] I am here with you.
[1157.84] My child.
[1232.72] Greetings, aunt.
[1234.16] Greetings.
[1235.80] Thank God, Shanzey that you came,
[1237.60] now go and talk to your friend,
[1239.84] ask her why she made 
this condition of herself.
[1245.04] What should I ask her?
[1248.56] I know everything.
[1251.76] Shanzey, my child,
[1253.88] what did you start thinking?
[1255.32] Go and talk to her she will definitely 
tell you what is it.
[1259.96] Don’t you worry, I will go and 
ask her what is the problem.
[1262.88] Thank you, my child.
 Go and ask her,
[1265.48] I can’t see her in this condition, 
my heart is sinking.
[1268.56] Okay, relax, I will just go 
and ask her right now.
[1282.56] Did you talk to Arooj?
[1285.56] Did she tell you anything?
[1289.04] No, she didn’t tell anything
[1293.20] but I have figured it out myself.
[1302.52] Figured what?
[1306.64] That there is definitely some problem
between the mother and daughter.
[1313.64] But how can there be a problem?
[1319.12] They are very attached 
to each other.
[1324.04] It is just my idea,
[1330.56] I have sent Arooj to 
meet her parents,
[1334.00] now when she comes back, we will 
get to know what is the matter.
[1359.88] Have patience Arooj,
[1361.80] we are trying to find out,
[1364.32] and we will definitely find a clue.
[1368.96] How can I be patient,
[1373.52] you don’t know Shanzey,
[1377.84] the pain and hell I am going through.
[1387.28] Do you know,
[1390.52] I have started to feel disgusted 
by myself,
[1397.48] who am I?
[1400.88] What is my identity?
[1406.16] How can someone leave their child?
[1412.00] How can any parents get separated
from their child?
[1415.48] Unless they want to leave her 
themselves?
[1426.68] Now I am in pursuit of no one.
[1436.40] Now I am just in pursuit of 
my own existence.
[1446.16] Don’t think like that, Arooj,
[1448.52] your thoughts will take you 
to the darkness.
[1451.96] How can I not think, Shanzey?
[1455.04] How should I stop myself?
[1459.64] I have started to feel disgusted 
with myself, who am I?
[1464.32] What is my identity?
[1470.84] Until when will I run from myself?
[1473.80] Until when?
[1477.52] Arooj, have faith in God.
[1479.60] Make yourself strong, 
everything will be fine.
[1564.24] I don’t expect such a stupid act 
from you at all.
[1569.36] I am sorry, Aunt.
[1579.40] I couldn’t understand myself 
what I was doing.
[1583.72] My love, it is not important 
what you are doing,
[1588.20] what’s more important is 
why are you doing it?
[1592.60] I didn’t expect this from you, 
my child,
[1596.00] what was this weird act?
[1598.16] If there is a problem or any issue,
[1600.56] then tell me, share it with me,
[1604.80] I might be able to help you 
somehow,
[1607.72] hmm?
[1632.40] no one can help me.
[1638.60] My foundation cannot change.
[1642.72] What are you saying, my child?
[1647.88] My child, Arooj?
[1651.28] What do you mean? 
Don’t say that.
[1658.36] Don’t you worry,
[1663.16] I won’t harm myself.
[1669.72] That is what I expect from you.
[1681.20] What does she know?
[1687.80] How I had grief equals 
to Mountain on me.
[1697.80] They think that
[1704.32] I will cause harm to myself 
because of something.
[1715.72] What do I even have to ruin?
[1725.16] Nothing at all.
[1736.08] No one can understand my pain.
[1746.40] I am a leaf that has fallen
from the branch,
[1757.04] whose fate is merciless,
[1766.12] wherever it takes her,
[1771.76] that weak leaf
[1776.72] cannot do anything to the wind.
[1823.28] The drama that Arooj performed today,
[1826.64] what did she tell you about it?
[1831.28] I asked her
[1834.40] but she didn’t give any answer.
[1841.56] I am tired of asking her but 
she is not telling anything,
[1847.68] is there anyone in this house who can 
ask what has happened to her?
[1851.12] No one is there to ask 
anything from her.
[1867.04] When you couldn’t find out,
[1869.00] I am not anywhere is her list ever.
[1871.56] Mom, you cannot leave me alone 
by saying that.
[1873.64] I am with you, Salman.
[1880.56] If you are with Salman then 
who is with me?
[1894.08] I am alone then.
[1896.60] Here,
[1897.88] her dramas start again,
[1903.76] so everyone’s attention is on her.
[1907.44] I don’t want anyone’s attention on me,
[1911.28] leave me alone,
I want to stay alone.
[1916.72] Oh please, stop these filmy dialogues,
[1920.80] I want to stay alone,
leave me alone,
[1923.64] this is your in-laws’ house, 
not your mother’s house.
[1931.64] Arooj?
[1932.96] Arooj?
[1940.96] This girl has destroyed the peace 
of this house.
[1944.72] I don’t know what has happened 
to Arooj,
[1947.52] I am unable to understand anything.
[1979.72] Here,
[1981.12] her dramas start again,
[1987.08] so everyone’s attention is on her.
[1991.92] Oh please, stop these filmy dialogues,
[1995.92] I want to stay alone,
leave me alone,
[1998.76] this is your in-laws’ house, 
not your mother’s house.
[2026.32] Is this not my mother’s house?
[2037.96] But the place where 
I have come from
[2047.16] is not my mother’s house either.
[2057.56] So where is my mother’s house?
[2072.52] Where is that house,
[2080.48] where my mother lives?
[2197.04] Mom?
