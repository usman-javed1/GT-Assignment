[21.04] It is so hot, the sun is shooting fire.
[24.60] And things have become so expensive.
[27.76] Naseema, I have brought the grocery.
[32.12] Greetings papa.
[33.44] Greetings. 
When did you come, child?
[36.56] A little while back.
[38.36] Your mother thought of making korma, 
and you have come.
[42.68] Now we will enjoy having korma. 
Where is Naseema?
[46.68] She is inside, she is coming.
[52.64] What is the matter, child? 
You are really quiet.
[59.72] Nothing, papa. 
Just like that.
[63.64] Will Salman come in the evening?
[67.00] No,
[69.12] he won’t come.
[71.04] Yes, that’s the issue of a businessman.
[74.16] He is really busy.
[78.32] He is not busy with business,
[81.04] he is busy with the marriage.
[83.40] Really? Whose marriage?
[89.40] His own marriage.
[92.84] What? What are you saying?
[94.84] You come inside.
[97.40] See what Arooj is saying.
[101.68] I will tell you.
[103.48] You will get unwell. 
You come inside with me.
[105.60] Hey, Naseema.
[157.64] So your mother didn’t tell you 
to take back this stupid decision?
[165.12] Mama and papa know
[168.44] when I do what, and with 
what thinking I do it.
[174.44] Even when choosing such 
a big path for your life.
[182.84] They brought me up.
[188.04] Now they will just trust me.
[193.32] Okay, here you go.
[196.32] No, I don’t feel like it.
[199.04] Why? What happened? 
Are you feeling okay? Show me.
[205.32] I feel like vomiting since morning,
[207.88] I am not well.
[214.68] Really?
[217.88] Are you joking?
[220.76] No, I am right. Why?
[223.92] Arooj, I think it is something else.
[228.96] Now you are joking with me, aunt.
[237.28] What hopes can you have from a woman
[240.12] who cannot become a mother?
[284.56] I cannot be a mother,
[290.52] and you are saying I am not unlucky.
[295.76] Arooj, I don’t consider this bad luck.
[302.12] You don’t think anything Salman,
[307.16] but people think.
[312.68] Or maybe they will surely 
make a decision too.
[338.12] Arooj,
[340.36] do you even know what mama 
is insistent about?
[344.92] I know Salman
[348.24] and I also know that you are fighting 
a war with aunty in my love.
[357.68] I cannot see you worried.
[363.56] This wedding will take place, aunt.
[367.92] He will get married 
where you want him.
[439.96] Arooj, have faith.
[444.60] Nothing like this will happen.
[447.92] You are my love.
[455.20] Tell me Salman,
[459.40] which will be my room in two days?
[462.96] Where will I stay?
[464.72] Arooj, no one will snatch 
your room from you.
[496.72] It is better to share love, 
instead of losing it.
[500.52] And I even agree to half your love.
[504.56] But Arooj, I want your complete love.
[539.60] Is it possible that I think of something
[544.60] and it doesn’t happen.
[550.16] Thank God,
[554.56] Arooj didn’t have a child.
[561.96] Now it has become really easy for me 
to get rid of her.
[570.76] And I am bringing my Salman’s bride 
by my choice.
[583.20] Now Alizeh will be my daughter-in-law.
[685.56] Master, have tea.
[689.96] I don’t feel like having anything.
[698.88] How many tests are there 
in my daughter’s fate?
[705.44] One test after another.
[708.76] The tests done end.
[714.00] Oh my God,
[716.20] give patience to my daughter.
[718.56] Give her strength, my Lord.
[724.64] Master,
[727.48] He is really beneficent and merciful.
[731.64] God doesn’t test anyone 
more than their strength.
[739.36] If He has given difficulties,
[742.96] He will also make it easy.
[745.72] Ameen.
[781.64] I have chosen Alizeh for you,
[792.96] and I will get you two married 
on this weekend.
[857.56] The appointment for the salon 
was for 4 pm.
[860.96] It is 5 pm.
[862.84] There is always a rush 
at the salon anyway.
[899.44] Ayesha Dosani called me so many times 
from the parlour. Come on. Come on.
[904.60] Come on. Come.
[907.80] Arooj.
[908.92] Little madam, 
what happened to you?
[911.40] Are you okay, child?
I feel dizzy.
[914.28] I don’t feel good.
[915.64] Okay come on. Driver, 
take us to the hospital.
[919.80] Seat her. Open the door.
[922.48] Seat her. Sit. Sit.
[925.32] Open the door.
[927.88] Let’s go to the hospital, come on.
[979.20] Careful, little madam.
[982.60] Tell us, what issue does she have?
Come on.
[989.64] How many children do you have earlier?
[996.52] What?
[1009.80] I have no children.
[1014.92] In fact,
[1018.12] I cannot become a mother.
[1020.12] Who said this to you?
[1022.44] I had got a test done.
[1024.96] This was in the reports.
[1029.24] The reports can be wrong too.
[1031.04] What?
[1034.68] In fact, you were expecting.
[1052.92] And I don’t know if you 
don’t have children,
[1056.92] then why did you want to abort 
this first child?
[1061.12] Me? I…
[1064.04] What are you saying doctor.
[1070.04] Yes.
[1071.12] She is in this condition due to 
an overdose of some medication.
[1074.56] I took some medication? I…
[1077.80] No, no, that’s not possible doctor,
[1080.76] Arooj is not taking any 
such medication.
[1083.16] That’s what has happened. 
That is why she got unwell.
[1089.20] The medication didn’t suit her.
[1109.08] What are you doing here 
in my room? Huh?
[1112.84] I was cleaning up,
and I found this medication.
[1116.88] I thought I would keep it 
in the drawer.
[1119.64] How many times have I told you 
not to get into my things?
[1123.12] Huh? Have I not told you?
[1126.60] Doctor, what medication is this?
[1131.56] This is a medication to stop pregnancy.
[1147.04] Madam, I saw this medication 
in madam Alizeh’s room.
[1165.08] Are you speaking the truth?
[1167.88] Yes, madam, I am speaking the truth.
[1309.32] Why did you stop? 
Come on.
[1312.48] I don’t want to talk to anyone 
about anything.
[1316.48] Child, why don’t you want to talk?
[1321.60] This is the time.
[1323.84] The truth is out in the open now.
[1325.60] What truth?
[1332.76] Even if the report of me not being 
a mother was true,
[1336.12] Salman said he would not get married.
[1342.12] And here?
[1344.96] Here, his promise turned out to be a lie.
[1354.96] Arooj.
[1356.32] Arooj. Wasai, you come with me.
[1362.72] Salman.
[1370.08] Where are you going?
[1377.44] I had told her to get ready 
and come on stage,
[1381.60] but she didn’t listen to me.
[1385.12] Mom, I feel Arooj is not well, 
let me check on her once…
[1388.12] There is no need for you 
to go anywhere.
[1390.80] Mom, I…
I told you,
[1393.60] go sit in your place.
[1417.72] Come madam.
[1424.68] Where did you see it?
[1426.96] One minute.
[1451.32] Wasai, it is also possible you had 
a misunderstanding.
[1455.24] No madam, I saw it with my own eyes.
[1459.84] Did you check all these books?
[1470.92] Look at this!
[1480.76] Oh my God.
[1485.12] This means
[1490.28] Alizeh was playing with my Arooj’s life.
[1496.96] Anyway, one thing is decided.
[1502.36] The report of Arooj not being able 
to be a mother is incorrect.
[1510.96] Wasai, come quickly. 
Come on. Close it.
[1514.28] Okay.
[1529.08] Arooj, nothing like this will happen.
[1531.80] I will not let anything happen to you.
[1535.68] What I want will happen.
[1545.28] No one will come between me and you,
[1550.48] I promise you this.
[1564.76] Arooj, let’s go. We don’t have time. 
Come quickly.
[1567.84] Where do we have to go aunt?
[1569.20] Come with me, I will tell you everything.
 Come on.
[1571.80] One minute, wait. 
What happened?
[1576.52] Salman Ahmad, son of Waqar Ahmad,
[1578.72] you are being married to Alizeh,
[1581.16] daughter of Mukeem Ahmad,
[1582.28] with a wedding gift of 
twenty-five hundred thousand,
[1585.36] in the presence of these witnesses.
[1588.00] Do you accept this marriage?
[1632.88] I apologize, molvi sahib.
[1636.88] You will have to stop this wedding.
[1641.32] Sister-in-law, what are you saying?
[1648.88] I am absolutely right, Mehreen.
[1653.44] Please, stop this wedding now.
[1668.52] Not now sister-in-law.
[1670.68] Now this wedding will take place.
[1675.32] Not at all.
[1679.52] Mehreen, you just answer me, 
why do you want to marry Salman again?
[1692.84] Sister-in-law, this is not the time
for these things.
[1697.32] This is the time.
[1699.92] Please answer me.
[1702.32] Why do you want to marry Salman again?
[1705.04] Because Arooj cannot become a mother
[1707.16] and she cannot give a child to my Salman,
[1709.60] that is why this wedding is happening.
[1723.04] Fine.
[1724.56] I will remove this misunderstanding of yours.
[1734.80] We are coming from the doctor.
[1736.88] Here, this is the report. Read it.
[1772.48] This Alizeh had that false report made.
[1787.24] Arooj can become a mother.
[1812.88] And this is the medication,
[1815.44] Alizeh gave to Arooj,
[1823.48] so that she cannot become a mother.
[1849.04] Sister-in-law,
[1851.28] what proof do you have against Alizeh?
[1855.44] I found all this medication from her room.
[1886.28] Now you believe me, right?
[1953.48] The lie has been revealed.
[1958.64] The planning with which you came 
to this home is unsuccessful.
[1965.36] Those who come secretly 
are called thieves,
[1969.16] they don’t become owners of the home.
[1981.88] Get lost from our lives.
[1984.08] Get out of here.
[1987.80] Did you not hear me?
[2109.76] Look if you think that this is my plan,
[2113.56] then this plan will be complete 
in two days,
[2116.76] then I will be Salman’s wife.
[2120.60] So you can think what you want.
[2125.52] In fact, you took too long 
to understand this.
[2129.84] You should have understood it
a long time back.
[2224.40] Are you still upset with me?
[2229.36] I am not upset.
[2233.60] I am sad.
[2239.48] Meaning, you are saying that 
I have given you sorrow.
[2250.40] Are you asking me a question
or accepting it?
[2256.44] If it is a question, then,
[2259.84] what will be your answer?
[2264.40] Yes.
[2268.56] You have given me sorrow.
[2278.72] If the reports had not come in,
[2282.68] then you would have gotten married.
