Wasai, you are getting worried 
for no reason. Everything is going in 
the right direction. How is it going right? Everyone in the house has become 
distant from one another. They have not become distant, they have just been exposed 
to one another and it's a good thing, I got my mother and
Salman got his mother. No, no young Madam, you don't understand! What young master got, he is not accepting her 
as his mother, and when you will tell elder Madam, then she will not accept you 
as her daughter. This way, everything has 
gotten more tangled. Wasai, nothing like this will happen. When I tell Mom I am her daughter, she will accept this fact. I just know I have to talk about this 
at the right time. Have faith in me. Okay, I will accept it if you are saying it. May God keep everything alright. Did you see? What happened? You think that you did a good job 
by telling Salman everything? He had to know. If your conspiracy had not 
been revealed then you would have never 
thought about telling him. I did what I thought was right. He is my son, Salman is my son! What young master got, he is not accepting her 
as his mother, and when you will tell 
elder Madam, then she will not accept you 
as her daughter. Salman, child, what happened? 
How did this happen? Salman, son, is everything alright? 
Are you okay? Yes, Uncle, I am fine. Actually, two people came 
on a bike and they fired. Thank God, I am fine now. Did you report it to the police? Yes, Mom. You did right. You did absolutely right. Okay, don’t worry, I am fine. 
Nothing happened. Ideees! Get a black goat quickly and do charity for my Salman. Yes, yes Wasai, go and make 
some turmeric milk. Go quickly.
Yes! Come on, come inside. Come. Come on, son. Carefully. Is it hurting a lot? Are you in pain? Don’t worry, I am fine. This means the bullet was 
fired at Arooj. Maybe this is just my thinking, or maybe I was their target. I don’t understand anything. Oh, Idrees, order a black goat and do charity
for my Salman. This is not a lie, Son. This is the truth. You are not Mehreen’s but my son! Mehreen is not your mother, 
I am your mother. I am not your uncle, I am your father, and Shaista is your mother. Dear, God! Help me. Help me! I never felt that you were hopeless. In six years of marriage, there was no child nor any hope. A woman wishing to be a mother, 
is disappointed. Well, thank God now, that He didn’t let your hope die. He listened to our prayers. Areej! It is so pretty, Mehreen, look. It is a very pretty name. So, you gave her a name of 
your liking, right? Yes, because Areej is a very pretty name. Right, Mom? Yes, it is a very pretty name. Now our entire home will smell
 of her scent. Areej! Why did I have such a weird dream? Waqar, oh, it is time for Waqar to come home, 
in fact, Waqar must be home now. Let me check, how did I sleep for this long today? How did this happen? Wasai! Wasai! Yes, yes elder Madam. Wasai, did Waqar come back 
from office? Why are you staring like that? Waqar, how would you know 
if he came or not? Because he calls me before 
leaving the office, okay I will wait for Waqar. Go to Wasai Bi. Young Madam is really pretty. May God protect her from evil eyes. Amen. Amen. Here you go Madam. That’s it, Wasai? Yes. Come. Come. Mama’s love. That’s it, Wasai is tired. Are you happy now, Wasai? Yes, yes. Thank you very much. Actually, I don’t have a child, so I just couldn’t resist 
after seeing the child. No problem, Wasai. 
You will take care of her. Yes, sure. Do you want it? 
Do you want it? What is all of this happening? It feels like we have gone 25 years back. The same tone, the same attitude. Young Madam! Young Madam! What happened? 
Is everything alright? Everything is fine but 
I am shocked as well. Shocked, about what? Elder Madam came to me 
in the kitchen, she has changed. She has changed? What are you saying, Wasai? She came to me in the kitchen 
and asked me about your father, Elder Master. She asked if Waqar had come back
from the office, however, she used to ask me this when Elder Master was alive and she lost her memory 
after that accident and it has been a while since 
she asked me about Elder Master. Are you telling the truth? What else did Mom say? The same thing, that Waqar didn’t come back, and then she said 
how stupid is she, Waqar calls her before 
leaving the office. It means, it means Mom is remembering 
everything, and all of this happened because of 
my daughter, Areej. What happened, Aunt? I asked Wasai to make
a cup of tea for me. She said no in my face, she said I am taking care 
of Areej. I asked her to stay with Areej. Why do you have surveillance 
at home? Couldn’t she leave her 
for two minutes? She couldn’t leave her at all. Why? At times, we are more unsafe 
inside the home, than outside. So, you have to keep a watch. What happened, 
Sister-in-law Shaista? Are you mad at me? Anyway, leave all of this, tell me, have you seen Salman? He was just playing with me
 in the room, don’t know where he went playing! What’s wrong Mehreen? What are you rambling about? Have you gone mad? Salman has made me mad, he has tired me by playing! I don’t know where he has gone. Maybe he went to the roof, nowadays, he likes flying kites, I’ll go and see. Salman! Salman! Did you think, if Mehreen comes to know that 
Arooj is her daughter, Areej, then what will happen to us? There are so many lies tied 
to this one truth, that will be uncovered. Nothing will happen, you just need to think from your mind
instead of your emotions. Think from your brain. I don’t have enough time to think 
and use my brain. It won’t even take a minute 
for this game to be ruined! And that one minute could be 
the next one. It is not easy to tell the truth, I am waiting for the right time. Removing Arooj out of our way 
is our compulsion, not our wonder. Our wonder would be, having no evidence left. There are two enemies of us, 
in our home. One is Arooj and 
the other is Mehreen. Now, we should do this, 
we should tell Mehreen that Salman is not hers 
but our son. What will happen from all of this? She will go mad from the shock. But our target is Arooj, who has the entire business 
in her name. It is necessary to defeat Arooj’s luck. We don’t have time. That’s why we will have 
to change the plan. No, no, think of something else. And keep in mind that 
the wind is against us, any carelessness will throw us 
to a new place. Remember this. What I thought is exactly 
what is happening. The first round of Mehreen’s complete
 madness has started. Arooj gained her mother 
with a lot of cleverness, but such an incomplete Mother! Now slowly, slowly, Mehreen will go completely mad. Now, Mehreen will not get better. Salman is my son, now only Arooj is left. She is alone now, I will see her myself! What happened? 
What are you thinking? Mehreen. What did she say? She was rambling about things. What things? She was talking about 
Salman as if Salman is a five to six-year-old kid. She was saying that 
he is flying a kite and he is playing around, 
something like that. What kind of rubbish conversation 
is this? Mehreen was half mad already, and your truth has made her 
go completely mad! Yes, but I fear, what if she hurts someone? 
Especially Salman? She cannot harm anyone, especially not Salman. You are agreeing to her love 
for Salman? This is the reality, whether 
we accept it or not. By the way, if Mehreen goes 
completely mad then it is beneficial for us. This way Salman will be ours easily, and all the properties as well. Think. Waqar worked with his own intuition but you work with experience. But to work independently, 
I need authority just like Waqar’s. Yes, so they are yours after 
Waqar’s death, right? No, it is not like that, Shaista. The decision is taken 
by the board of directors or the head of the board. And who is the head of the board? After Waqar, the head of the board 
is Mehreen. If she signs, then all the authority
will be mine on its own. Okay, don’t worry. Mehreen is mentally unstable, how hard is it to get her signs? I will get her signatures. Okay, if you say so, wait. Here, have this. Hello How are you, Salman? I am fine, how are you, Basit? The thing to tell is, the shooter who attacked you, we have traced him. We raided him but he escaped. So what is the point of 
telling all of this? This is not as simple as you are 
thinking it to be, Salman. Those boys are hired assassins and they have a criminal record. What do you mean? It means someone else 
is your enemy.
