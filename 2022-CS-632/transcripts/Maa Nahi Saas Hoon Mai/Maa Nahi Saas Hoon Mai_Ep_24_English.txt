Salman? You said you are not going
 to do this marriage? And aunt even bought the clothes. It means you kept
 me unaware and didn’t even tell me anything. Whatever is happening,
 let it happen but remember one thing, this marriage won’t take place, it wouldn’t happen at any cost. I never even thought that such situation 
will happen in my life, Shanzey. Arooj, such situations are very 
common when there is no child, you just have courage 
and take care of yourself. I am being courageous, Salman is with me for now but Aunt Mehreen creates 
a new problem everyday. What is the new problem now? She has gotten a new
 dress made for me, and it is her wish that I should sit with Alizey
 in the new dress. What? No, tell me that is a lie. I mean how could she do that? Is she a mental patient? I mean there is no one in that house
 that can stop that woman? everyone is helpless 
in front of her. Arooj by the way let
 me tell you one thing, your home seems like
 a TV serial to me, I mean everyone is doing 
whatever they feel like and no one is there to question. I don’t know what is going on in my life. Tell me have you told your 
parents about all this? I mean about all this drama? No, not at all, I won’t tell them anything, I don’t want them to go through 
all this trouble like me. Wow, amazing madam Arooj, you are saying as if they 
wouldn’t find it out themselves. I will see it when it happens but I won’t tell them 
anything myself. Arooj, I can only comfort you 
in such situation, I can pray for you that may God make everything right. Okay then I will call you later. Bye. Okay, take care then, bye. I have tried to talk to both of them, Salman is not understanding and Mehreen is not going 
to move an inch either. Mehreen very stubborn, she always stays adamant
 on wrong stuff. I am worried about Salman. Why? He is absolutely 
right in his point, whatever he wants 
should happen. The problem is that if 
we listen to Salman, we will have to disagree
 with Mehreen. So then let’s disagree. She will get shock and I don’t know if she will be able to bear
 the shock or not, what if she gets unwell? Okay then, let’s live with this fear all our lives. This is so strange that everyone should bear everything but Mehreen shouldn’t get 
any kind of shock. Shaista, that is the problem. This is not problem, 
Mehreen is the problem. She is a problem but 
there is no solution of it, the entire house gets affected. I am just worried thinking that what must Arooj’s 
noble parents think of us? That what sort of a family 
we belong to? We are so helpless that 
we cannot do anything, there is Mehreen’s wish 
at one end and the at the other end
 Salman and Arooj’s life. No Idrees, it is you who has 
stopped me else I, I won’t let Mehreen play
 with others' life like this. Did you call me? Hmm. You were gifted the gold set of our 
late mother on your marriage, right? Yes, absolutely. Return it back to me. To you? But why? because I said it, return it, means return it. But Mom gave it to
 Salman’s bride. Salman’s bride will only 
wear it now as well. I will gift the set to Alizey now. Okay. When you have given
 Salman to Alizey then that set is a very worthless thing. I will give it to you. What do you mean by 
I will give it to you? Give it to me right now, in fact, do one thing, go and give it to Alizey yourself so I can also see how that set looks on Alizey, it didn’t look good on you at all. Okay. And listen, don’t roam around with that face, 
it is such a happy wedding environment at home. Can one be happy in such a situation? Whoever is my Salman’s well-wisher, they will definitely be happy and I am noticing who is sincere towards this 
home and my Salman. Come in. For you. What is it? Look at it yourself. Okay. Wow. Is this gold? It is a gold set for you but for me, it is made with dignity. Is it from your side? Not at all, it is the traditional set of mom that is being passed on to you now. Thank you, it is an honor for me. you know how to say this word but you don’t know its meaning. What are you trying to say? You were my sympathizer but not anymore, you are the reason of my pain now. You are taking me wrong again. No, now I get you absolutely right and you are doing exactly what you planned and came here, you have achieved a lot of work
 in the name of friendship. Look if you feel it was 
my plan then this plan will be 
completed in two days then I will be Salman’s wife so then think whatever 
you want to, in fact, you have been very 
late in understanding it, you should have understood
 it a long time back. But thank you for this. Wow, I really like it. I have reached the limits 
of patience, Salman, until when do I have 
to bear this pain? I know you are in pain, trust me, I have been going through
 the same pain. I even gave the mom’s 
set to Alizey. You gave it to Alizey? But why? Aunt Mehreen asked me to. Mom didn’t do right. Salman, I will I will get destroyed 
between her rights and wrongs. Arooj, nothing like 
that will happen. I won’t let anything 
happen to you. In the end, whatever 
I will want will happen. Until when? Salman, until when will you 
give me these comforts? You know that there are just two days
 left in your and Alizey’s wedding and
 my trust being broken. Arooj, 2 days are a lot. I believe it when you 
make me believe it but I feel that you are 
gradually refusing. What do you mean? You are unable to refuse at once. Arooj, trust me, nothing like that will happen, you are my love. Tell me, Salman, which will be my 
room after two days? Where will I live? Arooj, no one will take
 away your room from you. She took the owner of my 
home from me, the room doesn’t matter. Nothing like this will happen. No one will come between 
you and me, I promise you. Salman. You are here? I was waiting for you inside. Look at this, how do you like the color? I don’t want to see anything, you are making our lives colorless. I want to bring colors to your
 life and all of ours. Just imagine, how will it look when the colors of 
the voices of kids will spread here. I don’t want to listen to anything, I don’t want to listen 
to anything at all. You just answer my question. I too just want to listen 
to you, Salman, but tell me this why didn’t you invite 
your office people to the wedding? Mom, please, come out of your false
 world of dreams, whatever you want,
 it will never happen. Whatever I want 
will happen, Salman. Okay. It looks like the manager
 didn’t tell you that I have canceled all the
 invitations for tomorrow. Mom, I am very happy with Arooj and I will spend the rest 
of my life with Arooj only I will not marry Alizey at all and this is my final decision. Salman? Salman? Where are you Salman? Quickly come down. Sister in law Shaista, brother Idrees. Where are you? Quickly come out. Arooj? Hmm? Arooj? Hmm? Immediately come down,
 mom is calling. What happened?
 Is everything all right? I don’t know I will go and check. Mehreen, what happened? Is everything all right? Mom, what happened? 
Is everything all right? I am leaving this house. Leaving this house? But… You just stay quiet. You won’t say anything, I am mad at you. You guys did what you wanted to. Now I am leaving this house and no one will stop me. Now you guys tell me, how will I face the guests tomorrow? You are not going anywhere, aunt. This is your house, and you will stay here only. Arooj, you know what is mom 
adamant about? I know Salman, and I also know that you are fighting a battle 
with aunt in love with me. I cannot see you worried. This marriage will happen, aunt, and where you want, it will happen there only. Arooj. Do you see what is 
going on in this house? I can’t believe that everything happened so easily? You are smiling? I am still unable to understand what happened last night? This is Salman’s love 
for her mother, I knew it that my Salman won’t let her mother 
leave he house so easily. You are right. But Aunt Salman 
just stopped you, it’s still Arooj who gave the
 permission for marriage. She was helpless, she knew that Salman could leave her but never his mother. Yes that is what I was thinking
 Arooj is not that coward, Anyway, stop talking about Arooj, tell me are you happy? You are about to be 
my Salman’s wife. Thank you, Aunt, thank you so much, all this has been possible
 because of you so thank you very, very much. But remember one thing Alizey, I am getting you married to Salman just for the sake of Salman’s child. And, what if I am like Arooj too? Impossible. All the girls cannot 
be like Arooj. Okay go and do the 
wedding preparations. Thank you, thank you once again. I knew you would lose before your last ball. You tried so hard and worried
 so much, but no luck, the decision that you 
have taken now, you should have taken that earlier, it would have saved
 you some time. Move from my way. You will have to move
 from my way now, why will I move?
 I am in your way now. Hey listen to this, it is a very important thing, because I am a new bride now and the room will be mine, what will you have? You know do one thing, make arrangements for 
yourself in some corner, it is just a matter of
 a few days, Arooj, then Aunt Mehreen
 and Salman will go to the US with me forever 
along with their entire business, so please make arrangements
 for yourself, okay? You haven’t spoken 
since last night, until when will you stay quiet? Arooj, what you did last 
night wasn’t good. I cannot see you weak like this, the mockery we are 
facing because of aunt I was unable to bear it. You are getting emotional, Arooj, do you know that after this marriage our 
lives will completely change? Why are you saying that? Arooj, love and attention 
can never be shared and neither do I love Alizey, nor I can give her attention, now tell me, do you have an answer 
to what I said? I do have an answer, it is better to divide the 
love rather than lose it and I am even happy 
with half of your love. Arooj, but I need your
 complete love. Half yours half mine, makes it a whole love, right? I didn’t understand your decision, and you never even consulted me? I didn’t want to worry you and dad. So aren’t we worried now? What could have I done, mom? The girl who cannot give a child, how could she save her marriage? And Salman, what is his reaction about all this? He is not happy either but what can he do? He cannot even deny it. Do you know mom, I only supported 
Aunt Mehreen so Salman’s honor and dignity 
don’t get compromised. Aunt Mehreen won’t change. Your mother in law is
 actually a mother in law, she doesn’t have the capability to 
be someone’s daughter’s mother, so I guess that is why God didn’t give her a daughter. I guess, I don’t know that but I did what I thought was right but now I know one thing, I will not back out from
 my decision now. You are my intelligent daughter and now that you have 
taken a decision, I won’t question your courage, whatever is in your fate. Mothers of daughters live
 in the hopes of good fate.
