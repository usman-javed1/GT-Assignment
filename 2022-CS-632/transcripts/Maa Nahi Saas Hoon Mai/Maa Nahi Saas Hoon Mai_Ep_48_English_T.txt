[51.48] What fragrance are
 you wearing?
[56.60] Don’t you remember?
[58.96] It is your favourite that 
you presented to me.
[64.52] Oh yes, I had forgotten.
[68.84] So, you still have it with you?
[72.52] Yes.
[83.24] Do you know?
[85.32] Seeing your love,
 I have realized
[91.16] that being near and being 
together are really different.
[95.20] I want to live near you
[100.44] and with you too.
[104.92] Fine, then,
[106.80] tell me,
[108.16] how will you punish me?
[109.64] I accept it all.
[113.88] What punishment,
[120.68] when nothing happened?
[200.08] Where are you Wasai?
[206.80] Yes.
[209.00] Where the hell were you?
[211.28] I was cleaning little 
master’s room.
[214.56] I had sent you to call Salman,
[217.08] why has he not come till now?
[218.76] Little master and madam
[221.28] both are not in their room.
[224.92] Where did those two go?
[226.96] The guard was saying they went out.
[230.84] Oh wow,
[232.12] I don’t even know and
[233.44] those two have gone for an outing.
[235.64] This Arooj is a magician.
[239.40] Till yesterday those two 
were not even talking to each other,
[242.16] and see, today they 
went for an outing.
[244.16] Surely,
[244.96] she would have taken my Salman
 to her parents’ home.
[248.16] Wasai,
[248.80] tell the driver to take out the car.
[250.04] Take out the car right now.
[251.96] I will go and fix her in
 front of her parents
[254.96] and I will decide there as well. 
You leave.
[264.24] We are really lucky that
[266.08] we got people like you
[268.16] and a son in law like Salman.
[276.24] We never had a son,
[279.96] but we got a son in the 
form of our son in law.
[294.72] We look for love outside,
[297.92] in a beautiful scenery, 
in a sentence,
[301.04] but love is inside.
[306.24] How did you think of this?
[310.52] It is not necessary that
[312.72] you use words to say something.
[318.60] Some things should be 
understood without speaking.
[322.60] Hmm. Shall we go?
[326.36] Let’s go.
[383.36] You look really good like this.
[389.28] When you get upset,
[391.20] I don’t like you at all.
[393.64] Really?
[395.56] Then don’t upset me.
[397.60] I upset you?
[401.68] And what about you 
acting like a hero?
[408.28] You are good at heart,
[410.48] but you listen to everyone,
[413.60] you are misled easily.
[417.36] Okay fine,
[418.96] everything is fine between us.
[421.80] Thank God,
[423.92] and yes,
[425.64] thank you.
[427.32] It looks really beautiful.
[430.68] Yes, that is true.
[432.96] But you know what?
[433.92] What?
[435.84] It looks prettier on your wrist.
[448.84] I know about him.
[453.20] Madam. Madam.
[455.60] Come with me quickly,
[457.28] stop her.
[461.44] I will call you.
[464.36] What happened? Who do I stop?
[466.88] Elder madam,
[468.72] she is going to younger madam’s 
mother’s home to fight.
[479.92] Fine, you leave.
[481.08] I am Coming.
[482.04] Sure.
[487.72] I think Mehreen has found out about
 them ending their differences.
[500.60] Wasai.
[503.72] Yes, coming, elder madam.
[507.20] Yes?
[507.68] Did he take out the car or not?
[509.12] What happened to him?
[509.96] Has he gone mad?
[510.88] Did he not hear you till now?
[512.60] Elder madam,
[514.40] I have asked him.
[516.44] Go and check how long it will take.
[519.12] Sure.
[528.76] What happened Mehreen?
[529.88] Why are you so angry?
[531.60] I am going to go put Arooj’s 
parents in their place.
[537.96] They call their daughter 
to their home all the time.
[541.72] What objection do you have?
[544.00] Firstly, she went to her
 parents’ home,
[546.00] then she took my son and on top of
[548.04] that she didn’t even 
bother asking me.
[550.76] You have a misunderstanding.
[553.48] Misunderstanding?
[554.84] I am seeing everything 
happen in front of my eyes
[556.88] and you are saying I have 
a misunderstanding.
[558.68] Arooj and Salman didn’t go
 to master Shoaib’s home.
[563.68] Really?
[565.32] Then where did they go?
[567.24] They went for dinner.
[568.60] They met me before leaving.
[571.56] You think I am stupid.
[573.68] Both of them are not 
talking to each other,
[576.04] and they went for dinner.
[577.56] Maybe you don’t know
[578.88] those two have made truce.
[581.16] Oh, okay.
[583.80] So, brother Idrees made truce and
[585.96] both of them made truce.
[587.88] So, if someone is bad, 
then it is me.
[590.28] Wow.
[591.72] That’s why I tell you to be quiet.
[595.36] Someone who interferes in
 the love of husband and wife...
[598.00] ... always becomes the bad person.
[600.72] Sister in law, you want that
[602.52] I see all this drama quietly?
[608.24] Elder madam, the car is ready.
[612.52] Go.
[613.72] Go and tell the driver no,
[614.88] I am not going anywhere.
[623.92] Sure.
[634.32] See, mom is calling.
[638.76] She should know when 
and where I am.
[641.04] Especially when 
I am with you.
[645.12] Hello Greetings mom. 
How are you?
[649.28] Yes, Salman.
[651.20] Where are you son?
[653.76] How is your father in law,
[656.00] Master Shoaib and his wife Naseema.
[661.36] Mom,
[662.56] why are you asking 
me this suddenly?
[667.08] Son, if you are sitting 
there then tell me.
[671.80] Mom, we didn’t come to 
uncle Shoaib’s home.
[674.60] Arooj and I have come 
to the restaurant.
[680.04] Really?
[681.04] I thought you went there.
[684.92] Okay fine, you enjoy your dinner.
[688.04] But come home soon, okay?
[691.32] Okay fine, goodbye.
[695.32] Goodbye.
[701.36] Why are you looking
 at me like that?
[703.44] So, you called?
[705.92] Did you find peace?
[707.84] Did you not believe me?
[711.52] It is not about believing 
you sister in law,
[714.40] I just called.
[717.36] The children have their own lives,
[719.24] let them live their lives by their will.
[722.04] Don’t monitor and dictate
 them all the time.
[726.08] Hey, sister in law,
 what did I do?
[729.20] I just spoke to my son.
[730.96] Why do you forget
[732.28] your son is also 
someone’s husband.
[736.40] Forgetting reminds me,
[738.88] what is this sister in law?
[741.12] Salman is my son and
[743.60] I am helpless that Arooj 
is my daughter in law,
[746.40] but only you are aware 
of things about them,
[749.72] and the mother knows nothing.
[752.60] Only you can take things
 out of a matter.
[756.44] and you people
[758.08] always keep me engaged
 in such matters.
[761.04] Everyone has driven mad.
[765.00] Driven me mad.
[772.88] She came to lecture me.
[775.40] She was telling me, 
he is someone’s husband.
[778.76] My Salman is only my son,
[782.68] why does no one understand this?
[803.48] What was aunty saying?
[805.24] Nothing.
[806.24] She should just know where 
and when I am going.
[809.08] She was just asking that.
[815.12] She felt that you and I have gone
 to uncle Shoaib’s home.
[821.44] Really?
[828.80] Thank you.
[832.72] Thank you.
[834.64] Order.
[836.56] Is this what she was asking?
[839.20] And look at me in my worries,
[843.00] I forgot to ask her.
[849.68] You don’t worry,
[851.36] once we get free from dinner,
[853.44] we will go to meet your parents.
[855.44] No, no, Salman. It will be really late
[857.92] and aunty is waiting for you.
[860.08] We have not gone there
[861.28] and she is calling you.
[862.64] When we go there,
[863.96] God knows what she would do.
[867.52] Yes,
[869.88] you are absolutely right.
[872.12] If we go to meet them, then
[874.80] mama’s doubt will 
change into confirmation.
[878.80] You know, can
 I say something Arooj?
[882.04] Mom doesn’t like 
your parents at all.
[888.88] She doesn’t like me either.
[892.00] Yes, but there is a reason for that.
[894.48] I forcefully married you 
going against mom’s will.
[899.00] And you know what?
[901.28] Mom cannot tolerate sharing 
me with anyone else.
[907.76] Anyway, we will
 not talk about this,
[910.28] and neither will you
 spoil your mood.
[912.56] We will have food,
[913.92] and go home.
[915.20] I will go some other time. Okay?
[923.96] Waiter.
[962.40] That’s it, Wasai. Stop it.
[966.04] Let me massage madam.
[968.72] When you feel sleepy,
 I will leave.
[974.48] Why?
[976.16] Why are you not sleepy?
[983.16] Why do I feel that you 
want to say something?
[988.32] I remembered something 
from old times, madam.
[992.56] I am thinking I will say it.
[996.52] Yes, say it.
[997.92] Today I saw a bracelet in
 younger madam’s hand.
[1003.20] What?
[1005.28] You too saw that bracelet?
[1007.32] Yes.
[1009.08] And seeing it,
[1010.24] I remembered that old time
[1013.16] when Mr. Waqar made her 
daughter wear that bracelet.
[1018.40] It was just like that.
[1021.32] Right, madam?
[1025.68] Yes, it was like that.
[1036.00] But Wasai,
[1037.48] it is something amazing,
[1039.28] her mother forgot,
[1040.76] but you remember everything.
[1044.56] How can I forget madam?
[1048.60] God knows what condition that innocent, 
flower like child would be?
[1057.40] What do you mean how she would be?
[1060.12] She will not be anywhere.
[1062.60] Don’t you remember?
[1064.24] The policeman said there are
 a lot of animals in the jungle.
[1070.04] She must have died.
[1071.16] The animals must have eaten her.
[1072.48] No. No. madam.
[1074.56] Don’t say that.
[1076.20] The one who saves is bigger 
than the one who kills.
[1079.56] Okay. Okay. Enough.
[1083.44] In future don’t say this,
[1086.20] understand?
[1088.52] Come on, get up from here, 
and leave.
[1091.52] You didn’t help with the pain in my feet,
[1093.28] but you gave me a headache.
[1121.40] Mehreen has lost her memory,
[1124.80] we don’t know anything about Areej,
[1126.80] that whether she is dead or alive.
[1130.48] And Mehreen is considering
 Salman her son.
[1136.40] What does all this belong to?
[1140.16] Your Salman.
[1212.48] My God.
[1230.56] Master,
[1232.76] Arooj has changed completely.
[1236.44] Earlier, she used to visit at times,
[1240.48] now she doesn’t even
 answer my phone.
[1244.52] Naseema, it is possible
[1246.08] she is busy in her home.
[1249.92] Nothing is keeping her busy,
[1252.92] apart from her mother in law, Mehreen.
[1259.20] She is a really weird woman,
[1262.96] she has the whole home confused.
[1266.64] She has also hurt Arooj.
[1269.88] You know our daughter is not 
someone who will get hurt.
[1273.84] Every home has such hot and cold,
[1277.56] you don’t worry.
[1280.68] I am thinking that
[1282.84] should we call her to stay 
with us for a few days.
[1286.60] She will get relaxed.
[1289.28] You decided yourself that
[1291.16] Arooj is worried
[1296.76] and she will come stay with
 you for a few days.
[1300.32] Hey, now she is someone’s 
daughter in law,
[1302.84] and your daughter after that.
[1313.28] What are you thinking now?
[1315.96] You are right.
[1318.68] Now she is someone’s
 daughter in law.
[1325.28] She was never our daughter.
[1329.56] We only brought her up.
[1334.00] Don’t say that, Naseema.
[1339.44] The ones who bring the child 
up are actually the parents.
[1344.24] and what about the 
ones who give birth?
[1348.56] If the ones who gave 
birth to her cared,
[1352.00] then they wouldn’t have left 
Arooj on the road.
[1355.24] Master,
[1356.48] they were not indifferent,
[1358.32] they were unlucky.
[1364.48] We named her Arooj as well.
[1368.44] We changed her name.
[1371.40] We changed it from Areej to Arooj.
[1387.12] You don’t think too much.
[1390.44] You will get unwell.
[1393.44] Just pray for Arooj.
[1397.76] What does a mother
[1401.52] have to help a daughter 
at her in-laws’ home.
[1409.84] Okay listen,
[1411.68] won’t you get me tea today?
[1420.84] I will bring it.
[1449.12] Salman, you go upstairs,
[1451.92] I will go meet aunt.
[1464.04] You didn’t sleep till now.
[1467.04] I have a question
[1469.04] that is not letting me sleep.
[1475.84] Won’t you ask what
 the question is?
[1480.60] When you have thought 
of the question,
[1482.48] then you will surely ask me too.
[1486.04] You are really smart.
[1488.96] More than required.
[1497.08] By the way,
[1501.60] my question is
[1504.84] what is the magic
[1512.52] that even after 
so much bitterness,
[1515.12] my Salman is still praising you.
[1520.84] Love is the biggest magic.
[1523.84] Oh yes,
[1525.64] I forgot.
[1533.88] You trapped my Salman 
with this love.
[1540.84] If the wife loves her 
husband, then
[1543.72] you don’t call it trapping.
[1548.76] But when a son forgets his mother
[1551.92] and belongs just to the wife,
[1553.36] then you call it trapping.
[1558.04] Now what do I say about this?
[1562.48] You have an answer,
 but you will not give it,
[1566.92] because you are more 
cunning that I can think.
[1570.96] I am surprised.
[1573.04] You consider my acumen, 
ingeniousness
[1575.48] and my love as cunningness.
[1581.20] You know how to talk.
[1594.08] Why are you going there?
[1601.24] I am going to aunt.
[1604.28] Aren’t you two getting 
a little too close?
[1613.04] I understand all this well.
[1616.48] There is no need to go to her.
[1619.12] Go to your room.
[1691.40] Wasai.
[1696.60] Yes, elder madam?
[1698.80] What happened?
[1700.28] Why are you crying?
[1702.56] No, elder madam,
[1704.72] I am not crying at all.
[1708.96] Sister in law Shaista said 
something to you,
[1711.64] you are hiding it from me?
[1714.76] Elder madam,
[1717.72] anyone can say anything to us servant
[1722.00] and we don’t mind 
what the master says.
[1726.36] Wasai,
[1727.56] I have never considered 
you a servant.
[1731.44] Tell me,
[1732.68] what the sorrow is if sister in law Shaista
 didn’t say anything to you?
[1738.84] There is sorrow, elder madam,
[1742.28] but not my own.
[1745.72] Then?
[1747.40] Then whose sorrow is it?
[1751.32] I don’t know this madam.
[1755.44] Wasai,
[1756.88] you are saying really weird things,
[1758.96] I don’t understand anything.
[1761.60] You do one thing, go rest. 
Go to sleep.
[1765.60] Yes, madam, as you order.
[1815.08] My heart used to say
[1819.04] wherever you are,
[1821.72] you are alive.
[1826.28] You have been brought up 
in my arms.
[1830.48] I remember your fragrance.
[1836.00] Elder madam
[1840.36] and elder sir went crazy 
with happiness on your birth.
[1848.92] All of them were really happy.
[1852.28] If someone was not happy,
[1854.56] then it was madam,
[1858.92] and even today when 
I spoke about you,
[1862.80] she got in a bad mood.
[1870.84] You are so unlucky.
[1874.68] Your mother doesn’t even know
[1878.36] that you were in her life at one time.
[1911.20] Mom.
[1912.76] Mom, what happened?
 Why are you crying?
[1915.32] Mom, what happened? Tell me.
[1920.32] What do I tell you?
[1921.96] What all do I tell you?
[1924.32] Here. Right at this place.
[1927.28] At this place,
[1929.24] where that Arooj
[1930.60] replied to me for everything,
[1932.88] she misbehaved with me.
[1935.04] Believe me,
[1936.24] she misbehaved with me so much.
[1938.52] So much that I was shocked
 with sorrow and sadness.
[1943.56] Believe me,
[1945.08] that Arooj misbehaved so 
much with your mother.
[1950.68] Mom, but what was the reason 
for behaving like this?
[1953.84] That Arooj, doesn’t need a reason 
to argue with me, Salman.
[1959.40] But mom, there must be a reason.
[1961.92] I just asked her how was your dinner.
[1966.48] How was your mood with Salman?
[1968.88] Did she not tell you 
that it was really good.
[1971.00] Her tone was such like
[1972.76] I have no right to ask her.
[1977.08] You know I have not spoken 
to Wasai in this tone,
[1980.80] and I…
[1982.44] why does she forget that 
I am your mother?
[1989.48] Okay, don’t worry,
 I will talk to her.
[1992.72] No, don’t talk to her.
[1995.84] You will go to the office,
[1997.28] later she will insult me again.
[1999.20] Don’t talk again at all.
[2000.48] Okay fine, you come have breakfast.
[2002.52] I will talk to her.
[2003.56] No, I don’t want to have breakfast,
[2004.80] I am going to sleep in my room.
[2006.24] Mom. Mom.
[2056.56] You didn’t go to the office till now?
[2059.96] Now I understand,
[2062.00] why you asked Wasai to bring
 breakfast in the room.
[2066.52] Yes,
[2067.56] so that the two of us can 
spend time together.
[2074.76] A time that belongs to
 just you and I.
[2079.04] Why don’t you say you 
have a problem with mom?
[2088.76] And you didn’t come to the 
breakfast table
[2090.84] so that you don’t meet mom,
[2092.56] and I don’t find out the reality.
[2100.88] What reality?
[2105.40] You misbehaved with mom?
[2107.92] Me?
[2108.60] Don’t lie to me.
[2111.48] She has spent the entire 
night in the lounge,
[2113.28] she was really worried.
[2115.20] What did I say to her?
[2118.44] What did she say to you?
[2120.80] She just asked
[2121.92] how the dinner was with Salman,
[2123.36] how did the time go, and in return….
[2124.96] She didn’t ask me anything like that.
[2126.68] You are lying.
[2128.36] Oh, wow.
[2129.96] You call me a liar,
[2131.56] she calls me a magician.
[2133.12] She says that I have 
trapped in my love,
[2136.60] and you are getting
 distanced from her.
[2140.64] In what tone are you
 talking to me?
[2143.44] Have you seen your tone? 
Your voice?
[2147.16] It is weird.
[2149.92] You get hurt
[2151.76] and you don’t even 
want to hear a sound.
[2153.88] And what about the 
wound on mom’s heart?
[2155.84] I am not responsible for it.
[2157.76] Then who is responsible? Huh?
[2158.96] She is responsible herself.
[2160.52] Because she assumes 
everything herself,
[2163.16] like you?
[2164.48] You put me in a spot.
[2166.56] You ask me questions, I answer,
[2168.36] because I am your criminal.
[2175.76] And I am your criminal
[2179.40] because I love you.
