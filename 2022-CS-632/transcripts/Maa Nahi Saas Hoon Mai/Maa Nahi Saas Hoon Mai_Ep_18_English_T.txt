[38.00] Come on, bring it.
[43.96] Today you didn’t even eat food
[46.60] and you are also quiet since evening.
[51.28] What happened?
[57.60] My heart is really worried.
[62.96] I miss Urooj again and again.
[67.68] These are two things.
[71.72] If your heart is worried,
then take some medicine
[75.00] and if you miss Urooj,
then call her.
[83.40] Why do I feel Urooj is worried?
[90.44] God forbid, Naseema.
[93.76] Urooj is happy with her in-laws.
[98.24] Now there is just one cure
for your imagination,
[102.24] call her.
[105.76] She is not even answering my call.
[112.32] My heart is really worried.
[116.44] Hey, she must be busy somewhere.
[122.28] You mothers immediately
worry for your daughters.
[169.20] Who is this teddy bear for, Alizay?
[178.64] I had brought it for Urooj,
[185.24] but the doctor’s reports
broke all my dreams.
[194.48] The happiness of you, Salman and
mine have been ruined completely.
[209.64] That’s how it is, Alizay.
[220.80] You too had brought a lot of toys.
[225.12] Do one thing,
[228.32] keep this teddy bear
with those toys.
[238.08] You know, had I known that
[241.08] Urooj cannot
become a mother,
[245.56] then at least I wouldn’t have wasted
my time and money on this girl.
[256.52] Everything went to waste.
[266.92] Wasai.
[284.80] Wasai,
[285.88] pick up all the toys
[287.20] and remove these pictures too.
[289.16] Yes, elder madam.
[291.48] Why are you removing these toys?
[293.16] What has happened?
[295.12] When you cannot have a child,
[297.40] then look at these toys.
[298.80] They look so inappropriate
in your room,
[301.24] like binoculars in the
hands of a blind man.
[303.48] Yes, but don’t get
the toys removed.
[306.28] I will distance everything
from this home,
[309.56] that has snatched the happiness of
becoming a grandmother from me.
[315.48] Wasai,
[316.40] pick up all these toys and throw
them in the store room.
[319.60] yes...
[360.76] Man, Salman, what is this?
[362.44] I have come to spend
some good time with you,
[365.12] and you are standing here sad.
[370.36] I don’t understand anything.
[372.04] What happened?
Some business problem?
[376.28] Life itself is a business.
[378.96] Please don’t increase my worries
by saying these difficult things.
[382.64] What is the issue?
[387.76] Man, tell me,
[389.24] do you have any knowledge
of adopting a child?
[392.16] Oh, so this is your worry.
[396.48] Answer what I am asking you.
[399.32] I think you will need
detailed information.
[402.40] Exactly,
[403.72] I need all legal information.
[407.56] I will ask you why you
need it the day
[410.20] I give you complete information.
[428.64] Yes, Urooj, go ahead.
[431.12] Salman,
[433.72] I have to go to mama’s home.
[436.72] Yes, then fine, you go.
[440.36] Tell me, is the car at home or should
I send it from the office?
[443.64] No, no, the car is at home.
[447.20] I just needed your permission.
[451.04] You don’t need my permission,
[453.92] you can go.
[455.48] I know you never say no.
[460.44] I just like seeking your permission.
[464.40] Goodbye.
[506.48] Are you going somewhere, Urooj?
[509.84] Why?
[512.56] Is it necessary to tell you?
[519.48] You look really worried, Urooj.
What happened?
[525.24] By the way,
[527.16] why are you interested
in my worry?
[531.16] Salman is my friend
[534.24] and you are his wife.
[538.36] I will have interest.
[541.44] Hmmm.
[545.48] If your unimportant questions
are done, then can I go?
[550.08] Are you going to a shrine?
[558.68] Why?
[561.68] To pray, Urooj.
[565.00] See, now a miracle can
save your case, right?
[571.32] Medical science has
said no to your case.
[576.20] I have full faith in my God,
[579.60] and He is way ahead
of medical science.
[584.56] I am really disappointed
with aunt’s behaviour.
[588.40] I mean, she threw
away all the toys.
[591.32] That is so wrong.
[592.56] You must be really hurt, right?
[598.44] God is really merciful.
[602.12] You will see,
[604.28] these toys will come
back to my room again.
[610.64] Hey, you can even get
them right now, Urooj.
[618.24] But where will you get someone
who will play with them?
[657.60] My heart was really worried.
[660.00] I mentioned it your father,
[662.00] he called it my superstition
and made me get quiet.
[671.84] Urooj,
[675.56] you are crying?
[679.16] What happened my daughter?
[682.16] Come sit here. Come.
[686.88] Tell me, what has happened?
[694.12] Sit down.
[703.12] Urooj,
[705.12] my heart is really worried.
[709.96] Child, tell me, what happened?
[719.76] Mama.
[731.32] Mama, your daughter
cannot be a mother.
[734.40] What?
[742.48] Who is saying this?
[744.52] Who said this?
[748.96] According to the reports,
that’s how it is.
[755.72] What will happen
now, mama?
[758.44] Nothing will happen,
[760.32] and you don’t worry at all.
[764.88] How do I not worry?
[770.96] I cannot give Salman a child,
[774.16] this must be a big sorrow for him.
[780.32] Look child,
[781.88] at times such reports
give wrong results.
[786.84] No mama, I saw the report myself,
it was stated in it.
[790.80] I don’t believe it,
[792.56] and I will take you to
the doctor myself.
[795.08] You will see, everything will be fine.
[851.04] What is the matter, child?
[853.24] Are you worried?
[856.20] I am really depressed.
[860.00] First cause of Alizay, and
now my medical problem.
[864.96] So there is nothing to
worry in this, child?
[868.12] If you get depressed like this,
[870.28] the complications will increase.
[875.20] The complications will increase?
[879.00] I don’t understand
[880.96] Come here, I will explain it to you.
[883.92] The thing is child…
[887.40] see child,
[888.52] to be a mother,
[890.08] you also need to have mental health
[892.64] along with physical health.
[896.96] But I cannot become a mother.
[899.96] Urooj,
[901.84] life hasn’t come to a
stand still on a report.
[905.88] And neither is this the last doctor.
[910.52] Don’t be disappointed.
[912.48] You will see,
[913.36] you will surely be a mother.
[915.92] First, you get out
of this depression.
[920.72] What do I do, aunt?
[922.28] How do I get myself out
of this depression?
[925.76] I don’t understand anything.
[927.52] I myself want to get out
of this depression.
[930.32] Child, breath in open air,
[932.52] laugh, talk,
[935.04] if you are in a good mood,
[937.48] and you live your life,
[939.88] then you will give a place to
some existence in yourself.
[948.32] You are right.
[951.16] You know, aunt,
[954.32] what you say really
gives me courage.
[958.20] Don’t be disappointed
from God, child.
[961.44] God delays but He doesn’t refuse.
[973.00] Salman.
[977.16] Sit with me some time.
[980.28] Spend some time with me.
[983.28] I am your friend.
[985.76] I know, Alizay.
[988.84] I am really sorry, I am
unable to give you time,
[993.64] but what can I do?
[995.72] I am really busy.
[999.08] Hmmm.
[1000.60] You will be busy,
[1002.44] you are a businessman.
[1007.84] But you seem
a little worried to me.
[1012.64] Salman, I can understand
your condition in your silence.
[1018.44] What do you mean?
[1021.80] What is my condition and
what can you understand?
[1026.96] Salman, look,
[1029.32] I know that
[1031.56] everyone wishes to be a father.
[1037.92] After that they consider
themselves complete.
[1041.28] Alizay, I don’t feel this way.
[1045.20] Salman,
[1047.20] if this wish of yours doesn’t
get complete for a long time,
[1051.84] what will you say to the world?
[1053.92] Will you show Urooj’s
reports as proof?
[1056.48] What will you do?
[1059.40] Alizay, what do you
want to say?
[1063.72] Salman,
[1065.88] I am worried for you as a friend.
I worry for you.
[1071.88] Tell me something.
[1074.80] Aren’t you being a little
too personal?
[1081.76] I had said something as a friend.
[1086.36] Sorry.
[1142.80] You are here.
[1146.04] How was your day today?
[1149.52] It was good.
[1159.48] Why are you looking at me like that?
[1163.60] I am seeing you smile
after a long time,
[1167.80] I like it.
[1170.52] Urooj, you don’t get depressed.
[1174.56] Hmm.
[1177.28] I am trying.
[1184.12] But Salman,
what type of life is this?
[1187.96] You are always busy in
your business and
[1191.28] I am stuck in this worry.
[1193.92] So what do I do?
[1195.88] The pressure of business is a lot.
[1198.96] Okay, you get fresh,
[1200.60] I will get tea for you.
[1204.60] Okay Urooj.
[1205.24] Yes?
[1207.92] I had to tell you that
[1210.08] I have to go out of country
this week for a meeting.
[1214.08] Suddenly?
[1216.08] No, the plan was for next month, but
[1218.68] I have to meet the client this week,
[1220.64] so I will have to go.
[1227.08] You will leave me alone and go, Salman.
[1230.44] I need you right now.
[1233.32] How will I live alone?
[1236.04] Don’t worry.
[1237.80] I will do one thing,
[1239.68] I will drop you at your mama’s place.
[1243.04] You stay there for a few days, and
[1244.88] spend time with her too.
[1247.24] Hmmm?
[1249.36] Fine.
[1252.24] I will get fresh and come.
[1280.80] Hello.
[1282.04] How are you Shanzay?
[1283.52] I am absolutely fine, you tell me,
how are you?
[1285.92] I am fine too.
[1287.32] You know, I have good news for you.
[1290.08] What is that?
[1290.88] I am getting rid of that
Alizay for a week.
[1294.76] Tell me how all this happened
without any hurdles.
[1298.08] Actually.
[1299.40] Actually, Salman is going
abroad for a week.
[1302.16] He just told me
[1304.04] and he was saying he would drop me
at mama’s home for that time.
[1307.40] Oh great. Amazing.
[1308.88] Go, go to your mom’s home,
make them care for you.
[1312.20] Yes, and it is possible that
[1315.12] this forced guest we have at our home
[1318.48] will leave not finding Salman here.
[1321.36] Oh, wow.
[1322.44] Meaning, two rides in one ticket.
[1326.24] Okay listen,
[1327.28] when you go to your mom’s, call me.
[1329.36] I will also visit there.
[1330.72] Then both sisters will
sit and talk freely.
[1333.40] Yes, yes, I will surely call
you when I get there.
[1336.72] Okay, I will talk later.
[1338.20] Right now, I have to go
make tea for Salman,
[1339.88] he has gone to get fresh.
[1341.12] Okay fine, take care of yourself. Bye.
[1363.40] Hey, my daughter Urooj.
[1365.72] You look really happy today.
[1371.28] Yes, Salman is going
abroad for ten days,
[1374.32] so he was saying he would
drop me at mom’s home.
[1380.00] That’s really good.
[1383.08] But your mother-in-law shouldn’t
find out about this plan.
[1387.88] But Salman was saying
he will inform aunt.
[1396.04] Oh no. Okay.
[1399.04] Anyway, now go in God’s protection.
[1436.00] Urooj is playing really smart.
[1440.76] Now she will leave like this,
[1444.60] and I will keep on looking.
[1451.00] Salman abroad,
[1454.44] and Urooj will be at her parents’ home.
[1459.36] This is my insult.
[1515.72] Where is aunt Mehreen?
[1517.84] Where is she?
[1520.68] You have to take care of everything next,
[1522.96] come quickly.
[1533.12] Alizay, what is this bag for?
[1536.76] Where are you going?
[1540.92] I…I was thinking that
[1544.64] I will stay at a hotel near the airport,
[1550.00] then I will take the next available
flight and go back.
[1553.80] But why?
[1556.92] Because aunt Mehreen,
[1558.60] I just found out, that’s why.
[1562.24] What did you find out?
[1565.60] Look, I came for Salman
here from the US,
[1568.88] he is going abroad for some work.
[1573.72] It is going that he is going abroad, but
[1576.28] why are you doing?
[1579.32] Because Salman won’t be here,
[1581.92] Urooj too is going to her
parents’ home for ten days.
[1588.96] What will I do here?
I will get bored.
[1591.68] It is better that I leave.
[1595.32] How can she go? And
[1597.04] I don’t know about it?
[1599.92] I don’t know. You don’t know.
[1602.96] Anyway, you are not
going anywhere.
[1605.36] Go keep your bag
[1607.12] and I will talk to this Urooj.
[1609.56] How can she go anywhere
without my permission?
[1612.88] She didn’t even tell me.
[1623.20] How will you leave like that?
[1628.84] My name is Alizay,
[1631.44] and you are still a child, Urooj.
[1643.28] Urooj, I am going to the
office for two hours,
[1645.16] you complete my packing.
[1650.40] Did you inform aunt that
[1653.76] I will go to mama’s
home after you leave.
[1658.80] I will tell her when
the right time comes.
[1663.04] Okay, I will drop you at your mom’s
on the way to the airport.
[1666.16] Okay?
[1668.56] But Salman…
[1669.40] Don’t worry,
[1671.28] I will take care of everything.
[1678.80] without informing me,
[1680.08] without taking permission from me?
[1681.64] How can you go to drop
Urooj to her parent’s home
[1697.24] All this is your plan, right?
[1699.56] mama, I was going
to tell you, but…
[1701.52] Will you not feel ashamed
even a little, Salman?
[1703.44] She came from the US for you
[1705.68] and this is how you
will treat the guests?
[1707.68] Is this how things in
this home, work?
[1709.60] You abroad and your wife
at her parent’s home?
[1719.44] Mama, that…
[1720.20] Quiet!
[1721.64] Urooj will not go anywhere.
[1725.88] Alizay is here for a long time.
[1728.28] Don’t insist Salman.
[1731.32] Mama, look, please let Urooj go.
[1741.52] Fine, then,
[1742.88] if this is what you want,
[1744.84] then I will leave this home and go.
[1746.92] You do what you want.
[1759.64] Mama. Mama.
[1794.28] Now what are you staring at me for?
[1795.80] Pick it up, keep it.
[1857.20] I don’t know,
[1858.84] I mistreated Urooj every time,
knowingly or unknowingly.
[1892.60] Will you not feel ashamed
even a little, Salman?
[1894.60] She came from the US for you
[1896.64] and this is how you
will treat the guests?
[1898.88] Is this how things in
this home, work?
[1900.72] You abroad and your
wife at her parent’s home?
[1946.80] Hello.
[1947.80] Hello.
[1950.40] Yes, Salman,
[1952.24] did you reach the office?
[1954.44] Yes, I have reached the office.
[1959.48] Okay listen,
[1961.28] don’t worry.
[1966.52] Whatever happened 
today is nothing news.
[1970.28] I am used to it, now.
[1976.16] But I am disappointed that
[1979.96] Alizay’s wish was given preference 
over what we were saying.
[1984.40] Okay, I had to tell you,
[1986.96] I am not going abroad.
[1992.28] The client is coming to 
Pakistan themselves,
[1993.80] we will have the 
meeting next week.
[1996.96] Really?
[1998.96] This is a really good news.
[2003.40] Okay, you work and 
don’t worry at all.
[2009.00] Goodbye.
[2011.24] Goodbye.
[2035.96] Urooj is so naïve.
[2038.72] Despite all my mistreatment,
[2042.08] she doesn’t spoil her mood.
[2045.32] Instead she makes 
my mood better.
[2059.00] Yes, go ahead.
[2061.96] Look at this doctor.
[2065.64] What do you want to ask?
[2068.80] Doctor,
[2070.20] I want to talk to you 
regarding this report.
[2074.64] Why do you have any doubts?
[2075.92] What do you want to talk about?
[2078.68] I want that
[2080.16] you get this test done again.
[2085.60] Even we know this 
matter is really sensitive,
[2088.48] so we are really careful.
[2091.12] But doctor,
[2093.20] there can be a mistake 
in the test as well.
[2097.12] This means you don’t 
trust our test.
[2102.72] Okay fine,
[2104.36] if you don’t want to do
 the test again, then
[2106.80] we will go to another lab.
[2113.44] Okay, you wait for some time,
[2114.92] let me talk to my senior 
and inform you.
[2119.04] Excuse me.
[2149.72] Hello.
[2151.84] This is Dr. Shazia.
[2154.28] Yes, yes, I know.
[2158.28] I had told you not to contact me.
[2164.56] Mrs. Salman is sitting in 
my room with her mother.
[2171.60] Now you tell me, should
 I have called or not?
[2177.40] Urooj?
[2184.28] What is Urooj doing there?
[2187.48] We have declared 
a healthy woman, impotent.
[2193.68] So, they had this much right that
 they got worried and came to you.
[2197.56] and are you too worried?
[2202.60] I am not worried.
[2204.72] For me it is enough to
 say to her that
[2207.08] she gets the test again.
[2210.96] And she will get it done. That’s it.
[2213.48] After that, along with Mrs. Salman, 
everyone will find out everything.
[2219.76] You are really smart, doctor.
[2222.40] What do you mean?
[2233.68] Mama, I feel we should have 
taken appointment and come.
[2237.28] I think the doctor is busy somewhere.
[2240.32] It is a hospital.
[2241.96] There are other patients too.
[2244.36] And people come here with 
their hopes and worries, child.
