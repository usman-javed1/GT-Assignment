[31.00] Sir is a little short-tempered
[35.48] but he was never this strict.
[40.44] Why are you saying that?
[45.00] Because
[46.36] I feel very pity for Madam Jr,
[52.96] the poor girl is being
put through trouble.
[58.40] Madam, it’s just the husband
[63.08] because of whom a wife
spends her whole life with her in laws.
[71.48] It is not Salman’s fault,
[76.40] it’s Mehreen who has
taken control of his mind.
[81.84] The sad part is that
I cannot even do anything.
[86.00] who knows about your helplessness
better than I do, madam?
[94.36] And I even know that
[97.40] Madam Sr takes advantage
of her mental condition.
[104.32] That is why I am helpless
[106.52] else the day I tell the truth
[109.24] might be the last day
of Mehreen’s life,
[115.04] and this truth will be
the last shock of her life.
[119.80] I can understand your pain, madam,
[126.56] you are a mother ...
[129.60] ...who cannot even call her son to her son.
[133.20] Wasai, speak slowly,
[135.12] speak slowly,
[136.96] else, the years of being silent
[140.44] will turn into a storm
[141.76] and wash away everything.
[143.84] Forgive me.
[145.32] No,
[146.72] don’t ever bring this to
your mouth ever again.
[149.92] I will be careful next time
[152.92] but madam,
[154.68] if madam Sr’s own daughter
wasn't missing.
[158.72] Again?
[160.60] Wasai all these secrets
are connected,
[165.76] if one side reveals,
[169.48] every thread will fall loose.
[173.48] No,
[174.76] I am just saying
[177.28] if madam Sr had her own daughter
[180.96] she would have felt the
pain of daughters.
[185.72] Expecting something
nice from Mehreen
[189.20] is the biggest foolishness ever.
[193.20] You are right.
[195.80] Okay, if all your work is done, go
[198.28] check where Arooj
[200.12] is and send her to me.
[202.56] Okay madam.
[226.72] there is no misunderstanding,
[229.28] I have noticed everything myself.
[231.28] What things?
[233.36] Could you please explain?
[236.60] That is what I was asking Arooj,
[239.32] can you explain your relationship
with Ammad?
[242.44] But she didn’t give any answer.
[344.44] Arooj, my mobile.
[345.40] I won’t give it.
[346.12] Naseema? Hey, Naseema?
[348.44] Hey, what happened Master?
[350.56] That mischief took my phone
and ran away, catch her.
[356.68] Arooj?
[358.04] Arooj, where are you?
[367.92] Arooj,
[369.04] my child come in front of me
[370.68] else dad will get upset.
[373.24] Here I am.
[376.40] Arooj, my daughter.
[379.24] Catch this girl. Catch,
catch, catch, Arooj.
[381.68] Give dad’s phone back.
[383.04] Catch, catch, catch.
[384.72] You mischief.
[390.36] Come here. Catch this girl.
[408.16] Yet again you made the memories...
[410.00] ... of the past an ailment
of your heart today?
[419.20] Why don’t you understand
what I am saying?
[423.24] Okay, explain.
[426.44] Arooj is not happy there
because of Mehreen, Master.
[434.36] Only the fortunate are
happy with the in laws
[439.84] and no parents of any
daughter have...
[442.00] ... achieved anything by
being worried about this.
[445.12] So should we leave our
daughter to be that way?
[450.52] Arooj is educated and intelligent,
[453.48] she knows how to handle
these matters.
[463.32] So, is it necessary to handle,
[469.32] can’t something happen
[472.84] that might straighten
out this matter itself?
[478.96] And there is no need to
make anyone understand?
[481.40] Look, where there are people
who create complications,
[486.04] one needs to try to
straighten things.
[491.24] And the one who follows the
right path faces difficulties.
[496.56] Do you know what I think?
[503.84] Nature gifted Arooj to us
in the middle of the way.
[511.24] So why are you telling me this?
[515.56] I am telling you
[518.16] because we should be thankful for
the gifts that nature has given us,
[526.32] we should protect them
[530.80] and we are not able to
protect our Arooj, master.
[536.64] Be strong,
[539.20] the one who has been blessed
with this gift now,
[541.92] Salman will protect him.
[548.68] Do one thing,
[550.88] whenever you find an
appropriate time, do call her.
[553.80] You will be satisfied after
talking to Arooj.
[583.96] You will get scolded very
badly by me someday,
[588.56] what was the need to cry?
[592.16] Mehreen is a name of
such an evil spirit,
[595.64] whoever connects
[597.24] with her their bad days begin.
[603.44] I can’t even think like
that about them.
[606.08] Then don’t,
[608.08] but Mehreen will push you
to think like this one day.
[617.12] My mom hasn’t taught me to think
negatively or wrong of my elders.
[627.00] I have been an admirer of your mother’s
upbringing since the beginning,
[632.08] she has raised
her daughter so well.
[637.72] Aunt,
[640.00] such words from become my strength
[644.96] but Aunt,
[647.64] I don’t see any way
[651.00] through which I can make ...
[652.72] ...a little place for myself in
Aunt Mehreen’s heart.
[657.60] In Mehreen’s heart?
[659.40] Uff,
[660.40] who would want to live in
such a tough place?
[664.84] Okay forget about it,
[666.48] tell me something,
[668.12] how come your uncle got
against you all of a sudden?
[684.88] You don’t want to tell?
[688.32] There is nothing special to tell, Aunt.
[692.60] Okay then don’t tell
[694.80] I will find it out one day myself,
[697.00] what has happened that
[699.20] Idrees has become against
you all of a sudden
[702.96] but for your information,
the words that
[706.44] Salman and Mehreen are using
for you and Ammad,
[712.12] are not their but Idrees’ words.
[719.32] Yes.
[747.68] Come, come. Come.
[756.48] Come
[760.24] Master,
[763.04] you come here daily and
[766.80] feed the birds but…
[768.64] Do you remember
[770.00] that our Arooj used to come here
daily and feed the birds?
[777.68] And our courtyard used to
be crowded by those birds.
[784.44] Now that she has left,
[788.32] our courtyard has become empty.
[795.92] You are right, Master.
[801.60] The bird of our house has left,
[806.96] it just didn’t make our courtyard empty...
[811.36] ... but our entire house empty as well.
[817.16] Naseema, do you know,
[818.52] sometimes I feel that
[821.24] I am sitting here sad
[823.52] and she will suddenly come and cover
both my eyes with her hands
[827.88] and she will come in
front of me and say,
[829.96] what happened, dad?
[831.96] Are you sad because I am not here?
[834.92] look I have come now
[836.60] and then I will burst out laughing
[839.00] and then all of a sudden
[840.64] she will take my glasses
or mobile and run away
[842.92] and I will say, Arooj? Arooj?
[855.56] You are right, master,
[858.64] when I am cooking in the kitchen
[861.32] I feel that she will just
come from behind
[864.80] and will say you go rest
I will cook.
[873.76] My girl has gone to our house,
[877.16] she left her memories in our entire house.
[885.28] May God bless
my daughter with good fate.
[890.40] Amen.
[954.68] Ammad is saying with so much love,
[958.16] you should smile.
[968.16] No matter how dashing a boss is,
[973.24] it is never pleasant to meet them.
[985.84] but for your information, the words that
[989.36] Salman and Mehreen are
using for you and Ammad,
[994.88] are not their but Idrees’ words.
[1055.16] get the new car if you want to,
[1057.76] yes, yes, why not?
[1059.16] Okay I will talk to you later.
[1062.08] Boss, this AAZ Advertising
agency’s file.
[1065.56] Both cheques are in here as well.
[1067.84] Hmm, that’s great.
[1070.48] Now let’s get this signed by Salman,
[1073.04] and for every deal from now onwards
[1074.40] I will give you 10% instead of 5%
[1077.24] Boss, such generosity?
[1079.36] Are you being sarcastic?
[1080.64] No, boss, how can I dare?
[1083.08] I am giving you more share so
[1085.12] you can spend on your family.
[1087.64] Thank you boss,
[1088.72] but I guess you are
forgetting that ...
[1090.72] ...the cheques of such huge amount ..
[1092.52] ..cannot get cleared without
Madam Arooj’s sign.
[1097.84] No, Arooj has no value now.
[1101.48] Boss, she is the Finance Head.
[1105.36] I am talking about,
in front of Salman.
[1110.16] When I tell this to Salman, look
[1113.24] what’s written on his face,
[1116.52] anyway,
[1117.56] I am going into Salman’s room,
[1118.88] bring these files and cheques,
[1121.52] we will get them signed.
[1122.64] Okay Boss.
[1127.64] You asked me to do this work
as soon as possible, right?
[1130.44] Hmm.
[1131.32] This file has all the details of Sasa
Group’s 30 lacs and Stone Berry’s 65 lacs.
[1141.00] That’s okay, but
[1142.84] the notes from 30 lacs
didn’t have any mark
[1145.24] so we could recognize
where did they go
[1150.00] but yes,
[1151.24] the marble Mr Idrees has sold,
[1154.44] it is very important to
find that person.
[1157.36] By the way, I visited
this bungalow again
[1163.16] Bravo to the gatekeeper,
[1165.24] whenever you ask if there
is someone at home,
[1166.76] he says Sir is not home.
[1172.48] Mr Idrees has done such
a clean corruption.
[1175.84] Okay then leave everything,
[1178.68] we will take this file to Salman
[1181.04] because I am afraid that
[1182.36] Salman might not trust
anything that I say.
[1185.20] Look, I am so sorry,
[1188.40] this is your personal matter but
[1191.12] why did you say all this?
[1197.80] Uncle is playing such a dirty game.
[1201.40] What can be dirtier than corruption?
[1207.00] You won’t understand.
[1209.00] Okay but
[1211.00] it is not that easy to
understand Mr Idrees.
[1217.12] Madam, you? Please have a seat.
[1220.76] That’s not needed.
[1224.88] What was being spoken
about Mr Idrees here?
[1233.76] You are an employee here,
[1236.16] you should be careful before saying ...
[1239.28] ...anything regarding
the owners else…
[1249.28] Okay I will be careful next time.
[1254.16] It would be better if there
is no next time.
[1281.60] I am sorry Ammad,
[1283.48] I apologize on Aunt’s behalf.
[1285.48] Please sit down.
[1292.16] its ok
[1294.08] I have figured it out by
what madam says that
[1298.04] we are walking on
the right path.
[1300.36] But what should
we do about this file now?
[1302.72] We have to catch Mr Idrees
red-handed, what else?
[1305.96] And how would that be possible?
[1307.40] The accountant was telling that ...
[1309.32] ...Mr Idrees got 2 cheques
made worth 5 million.
[1312.64] I am sure he must be looking
to take this amount as well.
[1318.04] And how can you be
so sure about it?
[1321.32] Forbidden,
[1323.32] if you get used to eating
the forbidden fruit once,
[1325.68] you can’t really stop.
[1331.76] Hmm.
[1337.76] You are right
[1342.32] but this will be Uncle’s last bite
of the forbidden fruit.
[1351.60] Enough is enough now,
[1354.92] you just keep on finding out.
[1357.84] Okay.
[1388.80] Salman, my child I cannot see
you worried like this,
[1392.24] my heart aches when
[1394.52] I see the sadness on the face
of a strong person like you.
[1400.24] I am fine, uncle.
[1403.84] Now you, to your father…
[1407.96] I mean will you lie to me?
[1413.64] I know you have always
loves me like a father
[1423.00] and to be honest,
[1426.04] I am just lying to myself so
[1430.00] I can stay away from
the fear for a while.
[1435.28] Look, son, I am a man so
I can understand your feelings.
[1439.40] A man is possessive,
[1444.00] I am sure you are in pain but
[1445.88] end it now because
[1447.88] I am afraid that it will
affect the business.
[1449.60] What will happen to the
business, Uncle?
[1452.68] Hey,
[1453.52] Arooj and her incompetent team
have already ruined everything,
[1458.56] we are facing loss
in the business,
[1462.52] were there less problems
already that now
[1464.36] we also have Ammad to
experiment on our business?
[1475.68] Come in.
[1479.12] Come, Mr Nawaz.
[1480.64] Sir, there are few papers
of marketing and agency.
[1493.16] Salman, my child, I have seen them,
you should see them once too.
[1496.00] that’s not needed.
[1502.52] If you have finalized just tell
me what I need to do.
[1507.44] Son, our Housing project
needs marketing since
[1510.92] there is a lot of competition,
[1512.44] just sign these cheques, and
I will take care of the rest.
[1516.80] Give it to me. Here.
[1545.20] take it
[1547.68] Nawaz,
[1549.60] show this file to Arooj and her
Finance Officer once for approval.
[1555.00] That’s not needed.
[1561.44] When the owner of the
company said yes,
[1564.32] nobody else’s approval matter.
[1574.36] Hey, my son, I am talking about the system.
The system that you…
[1577.24] I am the system.
[1579.96] When I approved it,
[1582.60] that is the final decision.
[1587.92] And we are a part of you,
[1590.28] you are our support.
[1601.72] Okay.
[1608.96] If you are not well,
[1611.76] then go home early, I will…
[1612.88] No, no, I am fine.
[1616.24] Okay then I have some work to do.
[1631.84] What do they say,
[1633.08] where should I go after
changing the clothes,
[1635.12] who should I make my hair for?
[1640.48] Come on, at least smile.
[1645.28] Smile, Arooj.
[1664.20] Do you see the highlighted part?
[1669.88] Now check its date.
[1672.48] What were the prices
of it in the market
[1674.96] and what price have
we purchased at.
[1680.52] Wow, well done, Ammad.
[1683.52] I know,
[1685.16] see how loyal I am
with this company.
[1691.56] And Mr Salman’s mother
[1693.48] she always talks to me rudely.
[1695.60] Not good.
[1698.24] I will give an answer for that.
[1700.96] Aunt you?
[1702.68] What did you make?
[1704.16] I made Haleem, myself.
[1706.48] I thought I should bring
some for you.
[1709.08] Thank you.
[1712.56] How is your mom now, son?
[1714.08] Yes she is absolutely fine.
[1716.68] Ask ger from my side.
[1718.72] Okay.
[1719.68] I asked Wasai to get lemon
and the spices for it,
[1724.60] she is such a slacker,
I will go check her.
[1726.36] Wasai?
[1746.96] What are you doing?
[1747.80] Nothing boss, I was just…
[1751.20] Are you calculating your share?
[1756.44] Nawaz, money is like that,
[1758.56] you enjoy it when you get it
[1759.88] and you also enjoy it when
there is hope for you to get it.
[1763.36] Wow, boss,
[1764.56] such an amazing thing to say.
[1766.48] Send them cheques
so we can get our share.
[1771.08] Okay Boss.
[1771.68] Okay?
[1772.20] Yes, yes.
[1798.40] I need to talk to you to the point.
[1801.16] You?
[1802.52] You will talk to me to the point?
[1804.24] Yes,
[1805.16] because I am habitual
of talking to the point.
[1834.04] When my good is considered
my weakness,
[1836.60] I have to raise my voice.
[1839.80] Go away from here, Arooj,
[1841.12] before I say something
very hurtful to you.
[1844.16] So then say it, why don’t you?
[1846.44] That is what I want to know,
[1847.68] after all what is in your heart?
[1852.56] Things that are talked
about behind closed door
[1855.04] is called conspiracy
[1856.36] but that’s not at all truth,
[1858.56] tell me what is in your heart,
[1860.20] say it to my face.
[1904.36] Thank God, Sir is home.
[1909.08] Greetings sir.
[1911.32] Greetings,
[1913.04] why are you standing here?
[1914.92] Madam Sr has made
me wait for you.
[1919.28] She asked me to send you to him
as soon as you come home.
[1926.56] Quickly go, she is crying.
[1929.84] I will see.
[1938.68] Mom? Mom?
[1942.80] Mom, what happened?
[1944.80] Are you well?
[1949.56] I don’t know,
[1951.80] even if I am well
[1955.16] I don’t know how long
will I be okay for.
[1959.80] One of the sorrows
will kill me one day.
[1964.56] What are you saying?
[1967.28] Never say that again.
[1970.08] What happened?
[1972.76] I guess I just have this
to talk about now.
[1978.52] What has happened? Tell me?
[1983.24] Arooj,
[1986.96] the biggest sorrow
of my life is Arooj.
[2013.08] Is that even life?
[2020.08] That is hanging
between yes and no.
[2028.28] It is a crime to bear punishment
without committing a crime.
[2037.20] And this is my life
[2047.68] that I have got just for once,
[2058.32] handing it over to an expedience
will be hypocrisy.
[2094.40] Aunt, I have decided,
[2096.92] I will talk to Salman today
[2098.80] and I will talk to him to the point,
[2100.80] I can’t bear the pain of these
incomplete issues daily.
[2105.88] What will you say?
[2108.40] that he has to change
the way he thinks,
[2115.36] in fact, the thought that Aunt
Mehreen has been feeding his brain.
[2121.68] I agree with you,
[2125.16] Salman can never think like that.
[2127.40] exactly,
[2128.64] Salman can never think like this.
[2134.68] Aunt, I know Salman very well,
[2137.68] he is not the man who
can think like this,
[2141.04] Words are being put into
Salman mouth.
[2150.88] It is just Aunt Mehreen’s
personal grudges for me that
[2154.60] she is taking out on
me through Salman.
[2160.60] Mehreen has nothing
except hate.
[2168.84] Anyway,
[2170.40] I will talk to Salman with you.
[2173.16] No Aunt,
[2174.44] you leave this argument to me,
[2179.88] because if you continuously
interfere in this matter,
[2183.00] I think Salman will
start to ignore you.
[2191.36] And if that happens once
[2194.44] then who will speak for
me in this house?
[2197.84] Wasai, where is Salman?
[2201.76] Madam, Sir is in Madam Sr’s room.
[2213.76] Okay go.
[2215.72] ok
[2217.56] Mehreen captured Salman as
soon as he came home,
[2223.32] he won’t understand
what we will say now.
[2226.28] But I have to talk.
