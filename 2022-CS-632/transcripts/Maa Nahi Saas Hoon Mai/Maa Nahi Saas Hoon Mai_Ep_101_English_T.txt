[36.16] Dad?
[37.40] Arooj, my child, come here,

[40.36] Greetings.
[41.44] Come, come.
[42.68] Greetings.
[44.40] Sister Mehreen is here too?
[46.68] Come, come, sit down.
[48.84] Sit.
[51.72] Arooj, my child, come, 
you come here.
[57.32] Arooj,
[59.08] all of a sudden?
[61.36] You didn’t even inform us 
before coming.
[77.36] We would have told you had 
we known anything.
[88.24] Arooj, my child is everything okay?
[98.28] Dad, actually,
[107.16] Sister Mehreen, you tell me,
[109.52] what is it? is everything okay?
[111.64] Umm,
[113.88] actually,
[116.36] we have left that home.
[124.48] Left home?
[137.56] What happened, Arooj?
[152.44] There was no place left for us to 
live in that environment of hatred.
[192.12] Mom was very scared
[195.08] that it could be dangerous to my life 
and Areej’s if we live there.
[216.32] Okay,
[218.04] this is your own home,
[230.16] you and Arooj are 
completely safe here.
[236.16] Both of you get easy, 
I will get food for you.
[240.16] Come, Arooj my child, sit.
[247.20] Arooj my child, sit.
[253.88] Both of you get comfortable
[256.16] and then tell me the details.
[259.20] God will make everything fine
[262.04] and give her to me.
[271.64] Oh, wow, wow, she is sleeping 
peacefully today.
[276.88] Areej?
[366.60] Wasai?
[371.40] This luggage and bag?
[373.56] Where are you going?
[375.24] Yes, Madam,
[377.92] I am going back to my village.
[380.32] Okay, when will you come back?
[383.88] no madam,
[387.28] I won’t come back now.
[389.84] Why?
[394.72] Madam,
[397.96] I have been working here for years,
[407.36] now I don’t even remember
[410.52] when I came here for the first time.
[421.60] Mom
[423.64] and Sir kept me here
[429.16] then Sir left
[432.40] and Mom left too
[438.28] and I started looking 
after Madam Sr.
[443.04] All that is fine
[445.00] but what happened now?
[448.76] Now that Madam Sr 
is also not here
[453.64] so what will I do here?
[458.16] Okay
[459.92] so are trying to say that I have 
no value in front of you?
[464.56] No madam,
[467.00] don’t say that,
[474.68] we are servants,
[478.32] we don’t have any value.
[481.92] okay okay enough,
[487.12] don’t play with words,
[488.96] keep your bags back you are 
not going anywhere.
[495.76] I apologize, Madam,
[499.04] I have to go.
[506.76] I cannot live here now.
[521.16] Rethink Wasai,
[523.24] you will regret your decision,
[531.04] anyway, you can come back if needed,
 and I will hire you.
[662.12] Thank you so much.
[697.76] What is it, sister Naseema?
[705.44] Do you want to say something?
[711.00] Sister Mehreen,
[713.04] our house is in front of you,
[725.36] it is not as comfortable 
as your mansion,
[741.04] I apologize in advance 
for any discomfort.
[753.60] what are you saying, 
sister Naseema?
[757.20] Stop embarrassing me.
[767.68] Richness and poverty 
are useless things,
[775.96] I am very guilty of you,
[779.52] I can never pay back for 
your favor all my life.
[785.72] We haven’t done any favors 
on you.
[790.96] The way you have raised 
my Arooj so well,
[797.76] and provided her with 
higher education,
[811.16] I can never pay back for this favor
you have done to me.
[818.00] it's not a favor,
[820.20] Arooj was our daughter too.
[826.36] She wasn’t,
[829.28] she is still your daughter,
[837.20] and she will always be yours.
[841.16] You have boosted my pride 
by saying this.
[858.72] Have tea.
[860.64] Yes.
[890.64] We are so fortunate to find 
people like you
[894.56] and a son in law like Salman.
[896.52] We never had a son
[900.16] but we have got a son now 
in the shape of a son in law.
[905.96] Listen
[907.92] Salman is just your son in law, 
that’s it,
[913.24] don’t even try to consider him 
your son.
[922.04] Like a daughter in law is a daughter,
[925.48] Similarly, a son in law is a son.
[928.48] You have a very strange thinking,
[932.92] I will not tolerate any such thing 
regarding Salman ever again.
[946.88] Salman is just my son,
[949.60] do you guys understand?
[960.52] Greetings.
[961.56] Greetings,
[963.36] how are you?
[965.32] I am absolutely fine.
[967.72] Salman will be absolutely fine,
[970.32] don’t worry.
[972.32] Yes I know Salman will 
get absolutely well
[975.16] because his mother’s prayers 
are with him.
[978.44] Indeed, there is a lot of power 
in the prayers of a mother.
[982.64] Yes,
[984.24] a mother’s prayers act like a wall 
in front of the curse sent by someone.
[991.16] its not a curse, sister Mehreen,
[993.96] it was just a coincidence.
[997.20] Sister Naseema,
[998.36] I am so worried right now
[1000.56] so I don’t want to get 
into such things.
[1012.04] oh God!
[1015.52] These people are so grounded
[1021.12] and I humiliated them.
[1025.00] forgive me,
[1028.00] forgive me.
[1139.12] what happened, 
what are you looking for?
[1141.68] Arooj the file you were signing was
in the room and now I cannot find it.
[1145.84] Yes, yes,
[1147.68] so what? Where did the file go?
[1150.16] I signed them.
[1152.72] But one paper was left.
[1156.48] So bring it, 
I will sign it right now.
[1159.28] How will you sign, 
I am unable to find it.
[1161.08] I have looked in the whole house,
its nowhere.
[1163.48] So it's our own home, it must be 
here somewhere, you will find it.
[1167.76] By the way
[1169.64] I never so you so desperate 
for anything ever before.
[1205.88] Now you understand how you were
made the heir of the entire property
[1210.08] and business after 
Arooj went missing?
[1222.56] I will go mad.
[1224.48] No.
[1226.08] You don’t have to get mad, 
you need to act very sanely.
[1232.48] Arooj is a very clever girl,
[1234.28] she is also the heir to the entire 
business and property.
[1237.96] But she is my wife.
[1239.40] She is Mehreen’s daughter,
[1244.68] now that the reality is 
in front of you,
[1247.16] don’t expect anything good 
from Mehreen as well,
[1254.84] and Arooj will stand with her 
mother in this situation.
[1293.08] You are a liar!
[1297.88] Not just a liar,
[1299.56] you can fake love too.
[1301.52] Arooj.
[1302.40] Lower your tone.
[1306.80] You pretended to fake love me,
[1310.56] you falsely apologized to Mom
[1313.08] and now,
[1316.68] you will give up your life 
for your daughter?
[1320.20] I am sure you are lying 
about this too.
[1326.08] What did you think?
 Yeah?
[1327.76] What did you think? 
That I won’t find out anything?
[1332.00] I have read all those papers, 
Salman.
[1386.00] Arooj raised her hand on me,
[1393.48] on Salman Waqar,
[1402.52] and then she left from there 
like nothing happened.
[1411.08] How did I tolerate all that?
[1627.16] Nothing happened,
nothing happened,
[1629.04] what happened?
What happened?
[1630.96] That’s it, that’s it.
[1636.84] Did Mom’s fever come down?
[1638.76] Yes it has lowered,
[1641.48] I have given her medicines 
and put her to sleep.
[1644.00] Mom she has been crying for 
so long, she is not getting quiet.
[1647.28] That’s it, that’s it, what happened.
[1649.64] my child, she will get quiet
[1652.00] and you wait and watch all your 
problem will end too one day.
[1658.20] I am not worried, Mom, 
I am scared.
[1662.88] Problems are a part of home, Arooj.
[1666.36] A lot happens in homes 
and ends too.
[1671.68] Just pray that everything 
gets well, Mom.
[1689.48] Salman, come sit, son.
[1695.60] You are in so much peace,
[1698.28] I am not liking it at all.
[1706.64] The slap you had put 
across my face,
[1709.48] you will find the marks of it 
on your existence.
[1725.84] She is my daughter. 
Salman, my child, sit down.
[1728.16] Leave her. 
And I won’t let you raise her.
[1729.84] I am asking you to leave her. 
Give her to me.
[1731.08] Leave her.
[1736.76] What is this noise?
[1739.00] Don’t do this, Salman.
[1741.56] She is my daughter leave her. 
I won’t give her to you.
[1745.52] Salman?
[1748.32] This is Salman’s voice,
[1751.96] but why is he screaming like this?
[1755.48] It is my Salman.
[1763.20] She is my daughter
[1765.28] and I won’t let you raise her.
[1770.80] My child, you shouldn’t do this.
[1773.88] We can sit and talk, come.
[1777.76] The time to sit and talk has gone.
[1780.48] Leave her, I cannot live without her.
[1782.20] Why can’t you?
[1784.36] Didn’t you live without your mother?
[1789.16] She is my daughter 
she will live with me.
[1791.04] You can’t do this. Salman, 
stop, Salman?
[1794.40] Mom, stop him. Salman?
[1801.32] Salman?
[1802.68] Mom, stop him. Salman. Mom?
[1806.52] he took her.
[1811.48] Mom, he took Areej.
[1816.44] Mom, stop Slaman do something.
[1819.72] We will bring her back, 
we will bring Areej back.
[1822.36] Mom, stop him, please.
[1838.48] You come sit here. 
He took her away.
[1842.80] He took Areej.
[1943.68] What had to happen, 
what had to pass, it passed,
[1946.88] there is no need to pull me back
to my past, Aunt Mehreen.
[1951.64] Aunt?
[1955.28] You called me an Aunt?
[1960.00] Yes I did
[1962.64] and I will say it again too,
[1968.76] you all, especially you,
[1972.04] destroyed my life,
[1974.56] just to save your life, you took 
all my childhood away from me.
[1978.16] Salman? 
Go away.
[1980.56] Go away from me.
[1984.20] You don’t have to come 
in front of me again.
[1987.12] Salman?
[1992.60] you have found your daughter,
right?
[1997.68] Save these emotions for her.
[2012.56] I cannot do anything, 
my daughter,
[2020.44] your mother is helpless.
[2029.88] Forgive me.
[2039.84] that is not my Salman,
[2049.40] he is not my Salman.
[2061.08] I don’t know what I lacked
in raising him.
[2070.56] He cannot be my Salman at all.
[2080.44] Forgive me
[2083.84] I cannot get you what’s your right
even if I want to.
