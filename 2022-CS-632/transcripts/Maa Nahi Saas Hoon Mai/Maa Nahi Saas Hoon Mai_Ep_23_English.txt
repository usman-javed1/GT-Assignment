Who is calling me? Naseema. Hello. Hello. Greetings sister Mehreen. How are you? Greetings, yes, I am fine. Arooj’s number is off. Is everything okay? Yes. She is absolutely fine.
 Why? No, no, nothing happened. Actually, her phone is not 
connecting since morning, if you can let me talk to her… Actually, she has gone to
 a function with her husband. Okay, then I will call 
on Salman’s number. Please don’t call him right now, it is possible he is driving. Okay fine. Even last time, my son had an 
accident because Arooj called her. Fine, sister Mehreen. I will not call him. But when those people
 come back, then will you let me talk to her? Yes, fine. I will let you talk to her. Goodbye. Goodbye. Arooj is not even there. Then where can she go? Do you know, Salman, these sarcastic waves, these blessed tides, how serene it is here? You are crazy, Arooj. You find peace in these sarcastic 
waves, and this noisy sea? Yes, maybe I am crazy. Because this madness of the sea, this noisy water, it calms down the storm inside me. And do you know? Whenever I want to talk to myself, then I come here. I am doing this for Salman,
 for aunt Mehreen’s happiness. I mean, it’s for them, not for me. I have to give them the 
happiness of a child, that you couldn’t give them. I just have to do it for them. You are amazing.. Do you know how worried I was? Where did I not look for you? and I find peace here. What is the restlessness? Don’t you know? I am being made to share
 my husband, and you are asking me what 
is making me restless? Arooj, nothing like this will happen. At least not with me being here. and how long will you 
not want this for? Are you doubting me? It is becoming really difficult 
for me to trust this from you, in front of aunt’s insistence. What insistence? Can anyone be more 
stubborn than Salman? Trust me, nothing will happen. Aunty, has given that Alizeh 
so much confidence that she has started to taunt
 me in my own home, she misbehaves with me. She did this? Don’t worry, I will take care of her. What will you take care of? Aunty has announced the 
wedding on this weekend. Arooj, mama keeps on saying these things. I am the one who has 
to get married, right? I will say no. Will you say no to aunt? I will clearly refuse. Okay, come on get up, let’s go home. Arooj, come on, get up. Come on. Arooj, you consider me your enemy. You also insult me. Since you left home, I wish 
you never come back, and even if you come
 back stubbornly, then I will not leave any 
path for you to come back. I feel that I will have to 
use this tablet now. Because aunt Mehreen didn’t 
decide in my favour. Now I don’t see my plan getting
 successful without these tablets. So, this is the first tablet. Who are you making 
coffee for, Wasai? For younger madam. For Arooj? Yes. Wasai, actually, I was thinking if I make this coffee and give it to Arooj with my own hands, she will really like it, right? No. No. Why do you bother? Hey, if I give it, then maybe we will become friends. You go and do the other work, I will give her the coffee. Okay, as you like it. Go. Yes? I brought coffee for you. I saw Wasai making it, so I thought I would take it. Maybe you would think good of me. I cannot think bad for you, and you have not left me 
capable to think good. That’s true. My bad. Have the coffee at least. I don’t want to have it. I have really disturbed you. and maybe you are even 
disturbing me right now. Are you upset with me? Arooj, I never intended to come and interfere between you and Salman. Whatever I am doing is for aunt. Because she wants this, 
I am only helpless, Arooj. You are not a child, that you followed Mehreen aunty’s 
direction in whatever she said. I will not be fooled by these 
useless things you are saying. My tears, what I say, it all seems like a lie, an attempt to fool you, right? It will feel that way, of course. But I can explain you this, Arooj, I lost my mother when 
I was really young. After that, I have considered 
Salman’s mother my mother, I have given her the position. That is why I am doing 
what she tells me to, so that she stays happy. Only this is my fault. Anyway, but still if you want, I can take my flight back. I can go back. I have no problem. Fine. You can leave. Friends? Please try it. How is it? The coffee is good. Okay, I will go. 
Enjoy your coffee. You got the wedding 
cards printed yourself and asked the company manager 
to distribute it too. So, that’s how weddings are done, you have to invite people. Yes, fine, then don’t invite me in 
this happiness of yours. It is your wedding, then why won’t you be there? Because despite me telling you 
a thousand times not to, you are still insisting. I don’t want to marry Alizeh. I think that Arooj has 
driven you mad. Mama, see, why don’t you understand? Alizeh has trapped you. She can be my friend, but 
marrying her is not possible. I am really happy
 with Arooj in my life. You want to get
 Alizeh married, right? Then get her married. With whom? Marry her to anyone, so that your stubbornness 
is complete. I want her to marry you. But I cannot marry her. If not Alizeh, you will 
marry someone else. You have to get married
 again at all cost. I will not marry anyone. Mama, why don’t you understand, I love Arooj a lot. I cannot live without her. But I don’t like Arooj. Look, Salman, I love you a lot. But I don’t like Arooj at all, I only accepted her because of you. Look mama, Arooj has nothing bad that you 
accepted her out of helplessness. She has a lot that is bad. She is not as per our standards. Now Arooj is my wife. Whatever my standard is
 her standard. Fine, I accept what you are saying, still, now her not being able 
to become a mother. Is it possible that my only son remains childless? Despite this, I still love her. Can you not accept Alizeh
 because of your mother? Accept? I am not even ready to think this, and please, mama, don’t discuss this topic
 with me in future. And what about the circle I have given your wedding 
invitation to? Say no. What will I say? Say anything, I don’t care. But I cannot ruin my and Arooj’s 
life because of a few people. Salman. Salman! Arooj. Brother Idrees, now you make
 Salman understand. What do I make him 
understand, Mehreen? You see yourself, all the arrangements for the 
wedding has been made, the cards have been
 distributed and that boy is saying no. When did he say, yes? This means you too are 
calling his decision, right? I am not saying this, but… But what? You tell me, will Salman go against his mother? The issue is Mehreen, Salman’s will is also necessary. and mine? it is nothing ordinary and Mehreen have you thought what Arooj thinks of 
this entire situation. I don’t consider it 
important to think this. So, you are forcing Salman in such 
an important decision of his life? You mean to say, you will not support me 
in convincing Salman? I will try. Do you see, Mehreen? Yes, I have been seeing her 
for twenty-two years. that woman is intolerable for me. She has even gotten Salman’s
 wedding cards printed. Yes, the printer’s payment 
went from the office. What do you mean? You knew? Then why did you not stop her? Why would I stop her? She is Salman’s mother. Idrees, she got a five-star 
hotel booked. And also, a room in it for 
the groom and bride. They will stay there for two days Yes, she is doing all things herself. I don’t know who all she invited. Just Salman is not agreeing. You will see, this mad woman will remain standing 
there with the bride. It is such an important issue, and you are not saying anything. It is possible there won’t
 be a need for it. I will go, I am getting late for the office. No one is helping me. I will have to do something myself. What are you doing here
 in my room? Huh? I was cleaning up, so I found this medication. I thought I would keep 
it in the drawer. How many times have told you not 
to get into my things like this. I have told you, right? Huh? Don’t you understand. Go from here. Go, do your work. Okay. Sit, uncle. No, I am fine, son. Son, I am aware of the
 entire situation, still I came to talk to you. Yes, go ahead. I am listening. Your mama is really stubborn. She has forced me to talk to you. It must be the same thing, marry Alizeh. Although all of you know 
what my answer is. Your and my answer is the same. We all think the same
way about this issue, but it is impossible to make
 your mother understand. Fine, then, if it impossible to make 
mama understand, then me agreeing
 is also impossible. I wish Waqar was here today, he would have sorted this issue. At least he would have made
 Mehreen understand. Because I don’t know 
what I should do. Uncle, when 
I have made my decision, then discussing this again 
and again is useless. Son, the wedding cards 
have been distributed. We have a name in the city. If this wedding gets cancelled 
then people will laugh at us. So, should I give 
myself a lifelong trouble out of the fear of people 
laughing at us? People will also be 
surprised that Salman is getting 
married in eight months. They can be surprised 
if they have to, but I will not do i
njustice with Arooj. If we don’t find a solution for this, then very soon that day will come when all of this has to happen. What will happen then? that’s not something for 
me to think about. Mama has made the decision, she will answer everyone. She has put me in a tough spot. Now this wedding 
happening is a problem, and it not happening 
is also a problem. Arooj, nothing like
 this will happen. At least not with 
me being here. and how long will you 
not want this for? Are you doubting me? It is becoming really
 difficult for me to trust this from you, in front 
of aunt’s insistence. Wasai, keep the dresses here. What is all this? What is there to be 
so surprised in this, Arooj? These are a few dresses, select a dress for yourself, that you will wear at the wedding. Aliza is getting married Why is all this for me? I want that on the 
day of the wedding both my Salman’s brides sit on the stage together. But why? Because Salman thinks that I am doing injustice with you. In fact, everyone thinks this. Meaning, you will make 
me a puppet and sit in front of people. You are doing injustice with me. and this will be a matter 
of my respect. Everyone will feel I am 
treating both of them equally. It is not necessary what you are thinking is right. I will not be part of
 this drama at all. Hmmm. I didn’t come here 
to take your opinion, this is my order. Understand. Wasai, take these clothes. But… Take these dresses. Salman You had said that you
will not get married and aunty even brought clothes. Meaning, you kept me in the dark. You didn’t tell me anything. Let whatever is happening, happen. But remember one thing, this wedding will not take place. It will not take place at any cost.
