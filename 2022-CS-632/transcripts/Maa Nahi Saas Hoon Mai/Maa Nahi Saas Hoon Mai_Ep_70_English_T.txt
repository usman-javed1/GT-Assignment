[69.56] You are really cunning.
[72.60] You used to always be with Arooj,
[76.08] you used to show her love.
[78.48] Despite me asking you, 
you didn’t burn that picture,
[81.96] in fact you kept it safe with you,
[84.16] so that you show it to Arooj. Huh?
[88.32] You should be ashamed.
[91.48] You are really disloyal.
[99.24] Get lost from here,
[101.52] and yes,
[105.48] If I see you around Arooj,
[110.16] then I will teach you a lesson
[112.68] that you will never forget.
[114.40] Go from here.
[118.96] It has been so long
[125.76] that I have been loyal to this home
[133.96] and served everyone here.
[141.28] This is the reward I got for it.
[148.40] If I had to tell her,
[154.56] then I would have told her
 at the time,
[163.12] when so much injustice was done 
to younger madam,
[177.76] that little master
[184.44] is not the son of elder madam,
[190.40] in fact, he is the son of madam.
[203.28] I didn’t even tell anyone
[212.24] that this entire business
[220.44] belongs to Mr. Waqar.
[231.40] I never said that
[242.44] Mr. Waqar’s daughter got lost,
[256.28] and
[259.12] madam called me disloyal.
[271.04] It is true,
[277.44] a poor person’s neck is thin,
[287.16] everyone grabs on to it.
[296.24] God,
[298.12] you know my intentions.
[304.96] Give me patience.
[309.40] Give me patience, God.
[408.20] Okay Shanzay, 
I will talk to you later.
[413.12] Sure.
[415.16] Goodbye.
[548.08] Salman is your present,
[551.92] who you have under your control
[555.24] but I have come here to find out,
[558.76] whose family do you come from?
[565.56] Do you have a family of 
your own or not?
[572.80] After all, whose daughter are you?
[578.60] Mama.
[587.44] Hey!
[588.80] move back.
[590.60] Why are you stuck to me?
 Move back
[592.96] Mama
[594.08] What Mama?
[595.32] Move back!
[597.84] Why are you stuck to me? 
Move back I say!
[601.08] Move.
[603.44] Have you gone mad?
[605.56] Why are you calling me mama?
[607.20] I am not your mother.
[609.20] Mad woman.
[731.76] Ouch.
[732.92] Ouch.
[734.64] Ouch.
[738.16] Wasai.
[740.60] Ouch.
[752.96] Oh.
[771.56] Wasai.
[774.20] Oh.
[777.68] Wasai, where are you?
[786.96] Wasai.
[791.76] Wasai.
[805.32] Wasai.
[808.68] Rehman baba.
[812.20] I am in pain.
[825.56] Wasai.
[831.28] Wasai.
[861.60] Wasai.
[890.60] Oh.
[892.44] Ouch.
[896.64] Oh, Wasai.
[900.84] Wasai.
[966.04] Younger madam.
[967.92] Younger madam.
[969.60] Younger madam.
[971.56] What happened younger madam?
Get up.
[974.88] Younger madam.
[976.84] Younger madam, 
what happened to you?
[979.32] Younger madam, get up.
[981.92] Wasai, be quiet and
go call Mr. Salman.
[985.04] Sure. Sure.
[1020.60] Hello.
[1030.28] I am coming.
[1069.56] Little master is coming.
[1071.40] Little master is coming.
[1078.64] Madam.
[1079.92] Madam, wake up.
[1081.88] Madam.
[1083.32] Younger madam.
[1085.32] Younger madam, get up.
[1209.92] What is the matter, Naseema?
[1212.04] Are you feeling okay?
[1216.04] I am really restless.
[1219.04] My heart is really worried, master.
[1228.44] I will take out the motorcycle, 
we will go to the hospital.
[1231.24] No, no,
[1232.68] there is no need to go 
to the hospital.
[1236.84] Then what should we do?
[1244.32] Take your medication and sleep.
[1247.60] No, I am not sleepy.
[1250.12] You call Arooj,
[1252.32] my heart is really worried.
[1257.24] Arooj? Okay.
[1288.28] It is ringing, she is not answering.
[1292.08] Then call Salman.
[1414.56] Arooj.
[1416.08] What happened, Arooj?
[1418.28] I felt dizzy.
I don’t know why.
[1420.76] You feel dizzy?
[1423.28] Come, we will go to the hospital.
I will get the dinner canceled.
[1425.60] No, I am fine.
[1427.36] Nothing to worry about.
I just felt dizzy.
[1431.08] Arooj, what happened to you?
Look at you.
[1433.36] You are not fine.
[1435.28] Relax. I am absolutely fine.
[1440.84] No need to cancel the dinner,
[1443.28] just try to come a little sooner.
[1446.88] Are you sure?
Sure.
[1456.28] Take care of yourself. 
Yes.
[1459.88] Okay, you sit.
[1461.64] I am fine, you go.
I am fine.
[1478.32] Mr. Salman.
[1482.40] How is Arooj’s condition?
[1483.84] Very critical.
[1488.96] You should have been careful 
in such a situation
[1491.60] and the mother fell from the stairs.
[1514.68] The child could also have been harmed,
[1516.48] the mother has got injuries.
[1521.28] Look doctor, please.
[1523.92] Please do something.
[1526.80] Let’s see.
[1527.96] We will try our best.
[1544.32] Rest it is God who gives life.
[1557.80] You just pray, don’t worry.
[1575.16] Shazia, is the operation theatre ready?
[1576.56] Yes, madam. 
Fine, then come on.
[1683.64] Where are you going, Arooj?
[1684.80] One minute.
[1686.28] Brother, do you have methi puri?
[1689.00] Make one.
[1690.36] Arooj, what are you doing? 
You will get a sore throat.
[1693.20] Hey, their methi puri is really good,
[1695.44] I always have it from here.
[1698.24] Okay fine, you eat. 
I will not eat it.
[1699.92] You too will eat it. 
Okay one minute.
[1702.56] I am telling you it is really delicious.
[1704.72] Is it ready, brother?
[1705.96] Hey, you will get unwell.
[1707.72] Nothing happens. See, 
how yummy it looks.
[1712.60] Okay try one.
[1714.20] No, I don’t want to have it, you eat.
[1715.88] Okay one, it is really delicious.
[1725.60] Hmmm.
[1727.68] This is really tasty.
[1729.60] I had told you.
[1731.12] Brother, make another one.
[1732.72] Make one more. Just now 
you said you don’t eat it.
[1796.80] All this looks so beautiful, right, 
Salman?
[1801.56] It looks beautiful, right?
[1803.32] Really beautiful.
[1805.04] You will see
[1807.52] our child will be way more beautiful 
than this.
[1813.68] You know, Salman,
[1816.08] you are really good.
[1819.04] Really?
[1820.68] How is that?
[1823.84] Because
[1827.36] you love the relation that has 
not come in this world so much.
[1837.68] And the day he will be in your arms,
[1840.96] how happy would you be?
[1887.48] What are you thinking?
[1891.32] Nothing.
[1893.96] Okay. Do you know I have thought 
of a name for our daughter.
[1899.92] Really?
[1901.36] You know, I too have thought 
of a name.
[1904.40] Really?
[1905.64] What is the name?
[1907.12] I won’t tell you right now
[1908.52] and I am sure everyone will like 
the name I have thought of more.
[1963.80] Salman.
[1966.28] Hello Salman.
[1979.04] Hello, son.
[1981.20] Say something, son. 
What is the matter?
[1987.52] Mom, I need you.
[1996.72] Please come.
[1999.72] Salman, are you crying?
[2005.44] No.
[2008.64] Salman, what is the matter, son?
Is everything fine?
[2022.76] Nothing is fine, mom.
[2033.76] Arooj’s life is in danger.
[2045.76] You just please come quickly.
[2065.40] Sal…
[2129.08] Come on get fresh,
and feel better.
[2132.00] All this is not good for our child.
[2137.08] Okay tell me know,
[2138.80] what name did you think of?
[2143.56] I told you, I won’t tell you.
[2146.32] And you won’t tell me either.
[2153.28] I will announce the name of the child
 in front of everyone,
[2157.52] and I am sure everyone will like it.
[2162.68] Okay fine, you announce it 
in front of everyone,
[2169.68] and you know what?
[2171.80] We will name our child 
what you have thought of.
[2181.96] Okay, be happy now.
[2184.16] Smile.
[2185.44] Really?
[2243.48] Arooj is in this condition 
because of you.
[2247.92] Be quiet, right now.
[2250.60] At least tell me.
[2260.88] What will you do finding out?
[2264.76] What had to happen, 
has happened.
[2274.12] Arooj was coming down 
from the stairs,
[2276.72] it was dark.
[2278.04] Her foot slipped and she fell. 
That’s it.
[2282.52] This story is not as easy 
as you told this.
[2290.68] Your doubt is absolutely right.
