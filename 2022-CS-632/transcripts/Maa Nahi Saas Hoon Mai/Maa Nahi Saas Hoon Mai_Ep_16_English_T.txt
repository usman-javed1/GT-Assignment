[39.48] Urooj.
[41.84] Yes, aunty?
[53.52] Salman,
[59.80] see Urooj is present here.
[63.96] I want to ask you something 
in her presence.
[69.24] Mom, what is the matter?
[74.08] Do I have no right to become 
a grandmother?
[85.36] Why are you saying this?
[89.00] Because,
[91.44] I don’t see any signs.
[95.08] Why do you worry, aunty?
[97.92] When God wants, you will surely 
become a grandmother.
[103.48] I feel you cannot even become a mother.
[112.20] Mom, what are you saying?
[115.96] Really?
[118.00] You didn’t like what I said?
[123.04] Then fine,
[125.28] you get Urooj’s medical test done.
[132.40] I want to see my grandson in my arms 
once, I want to play with him.
[140.04] Do you hear me? 
This is my final decision.
[150.28] Mom.
[209.36] Salman.
[214.44] I don’t understand one thing.
[217.92] What?
[224.64] Sometimes aunt Mehreen gets 
after things like a child.
[231.40] Mama is like that from the start.
[236.40] I don’t understand,
[239.92] how did she suddenly think about me 
becoming a mother.
[247.04] She can get any thought at any time.
[252.64] Yes, but,
[256.28] we just got married seven months ago.
[262.68] I feel she wishes to be a 
grandmother soon.
[269.92] That is fine,
[274.52] but when God wills, it will happen.
[280.12] You are right.
[282.60] When God wills.
[288.12] Then why does aunty want 
to get my test done?
[293.40] When something gets into mama’s head,
[296.60] it gets stuck.
[299.12] Should I tell you something?
[301.44] The child that comes in the world
[304.16] will be the second child of our family, 
after me.
[345.48] Urooj.
[349.44] I wanted to say something.
[353.76] Look, if you ever have any doubts 
related to your health,
[359.68] then please get your tests done, okay?
Get your tests done on time.
[364.88] What do you want to say?
[367.68] I just want to say that just be 
very careful, please.
[374.16] I have faith in my God,
[377.48] that is why I have no fear in my heart.
[382.56] I am just saying it for your betterment, 
Urooj.
[386.64] I really want that you have a child,
you become a mother.
[394.24] I have no other interest.
[403.36] Anyway,
[409.36] take care of yourself.
[427.64] Why is she worried about 
my health so much?
[433.76] What is going on in her head?
[455.92] Shall we go?
Yes.
[457.60] Listen,
[460.20] can you drop me to mom’s home 
on our way back from the lab.
[464.04] If you don’t mind.
[466.64] What is there to mind in this?
I will drop you.
[470.72] Thank you. Actually,
[473.40] I am never sure of your mood.
[476.64] I am a little scared to talk to you.
[483.88] So this means, I am rude.
[486.96] This will surely spoil my mood.
[489.92] Salman, please,
[491.64] I didn’t mean that.
[493.52] I just said it. Okay, I am sorry.
[497.12] Salman.
[504.96] I was joking.
[506.64] Salman, you are really bad.
[509.76] Don’t worry, I will drop you.
[514.20] Shall we go?
Yes.
[516.80] Let’s go.
[525.00] By the way, which one of you wants 
to have the test?
[530.40] Look, neither one of us 
wishes to get it done,
[535.56] actually this is my mother’s wish.
[538.80] We are sitting here to do the test.
[541.04] But I think it is too early.
[544.48] So you mean that
[546.24] not having a pregnancy in seven months 
is nothing abnormal?
[550.48] Yes, absolutely. Nothing abnormal.
[555.32] Okay you come with me.
[591.96] Hey, wow, child, suddenly like this.
[594.84] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[596.32] Greetings. Come. Come. 
Where are you two coming from?
[601.36] Uncle, I took Urooj to the doctor.
[606.92] Why child? All okay?
[610.68] Yes, papa, it is all fine.
[612.72] I just went for a checkup.
[615.52] Okay. Okay. Come. Come.
[618.16] Naseema. Hey, Naseema.
[636.84] Is all okay?
[638.68] Tell me, what is the news?
[641.88] There is no news, mama and 
aunty wants a news.
[647.68] What does she say?
[652.60] She wants to play with her grandchildren.
[657.08] Okay.
[659.04] That is why she sent you 
to get a test done.
[664.76] Mama,
[666.44] nothing will happen, right? 
I am really scared.
[669.68] Urooj, child,
[671.60] have faith in God, 
everything will be fine.
[678.76] Pray for me.
[680.68] Sure my child.
[682.32] Okay, you go sit with Salman, 
I will bring tea. Go.
[703.40] Salman is really business minded,
[707.56] he made his business flourish.
[710.12] Master, may God keep my daughter 
happy and content.
[716.84] But I am really worried because of her.
[720.20] She was really scared.
[723.48] Hey, this is routine matter,
[727.28] what difference does a test make?
[729.88] But, Urooj’s mother in law is a 
really stubborn woman.
[734.48] What difference does that make? 
She can be stubborn.
[738.92] I just have a doubt,
[743.04] what is something is not right, then?
[746.52] Urooj’s life…
[749.20] Hey, nothing will happen to Urooj’s life,
[752.44] have faith in God. Come on, rest.
[763.48] Here you go.
[764.92] Thank you.
[767.44] How was your day today? 
Was everything fine?
[772.28] It was fine.
[773.36] All day long I had a few meetings, 
so we were discussing on it.
[780.00] Salman, you went to the lab too,
 today.
[783.20] So what happened?
[784.88] Yes, we went.
[786.56] In fact, we even met the doctor, 
the test got done.
[790.64] Hmmm.
[793.52] Till when will the reports come?
[797.96] I think they will be here 
in twenty four hours.
[800.20] Twenty four hours?
[804.56] You get them online in the US.
[808.20] Here I have heard you first have to 
get a slip made,
[812.04] then there are a print outs, 
it is a really long procedure.
[816.76] Yes, but you even get the result 
online over here,
[819.28] it is just that mostly people prefer that 
they have a slip or a print out.
[824.24] Hmmm.
[828.12] Show me the slip.
[829.92] Huh?
[835.16] Show me the slip. I just want 
to see how it is made here.
[839.60] Okay, just a second.
[849.92] Here you go.
[872.96] Urooj,
[875.04] don’t stress out, it will all be fine.
[887.88] Here you go.
[894.00] Thank you.
[895.32] When the reports come,
[897.36] please share them with me as well.
[904.92] Urooj,
[907.76] don’t worry.
[909.28] Salman is right. Everything will be fine.
Okay?
[926.16] Salman, what was the need 
to give her the slip?
[930.60] Urooj,
[932.20] what could I do?
She had asked for it.
[934.60] She shouldn’t have asked for it.
[941.24] Okay, come on, you don’t worry. 
Why are we worried?
[946.36] The result will be okay. 
Everything will be fine.
[981.12] Come with me, quickly.
[984.20] Open it here.
[986.96] Be quick Wasai.
[988.28] Yes, yes, madam, 
I am unpacking it.
[995.36] How did you like all this, Urooj?
[999.04] It is good.
[1001.16] Wasai, you have to set all these toys 
in the entire room
[1004.60] and yes, the pictures 
I have sent for framing,
[1007.44] as soon as they come, you have to put them
 in front of madam Urooj on the bed.
[1011.36] Urooj, whenever you get up 
and see those pictures,
[1014.12] you will see, really beautiful children
 will be born.
[1018.64] Yes, I have also heard the same.
[1020.88] and Wasai,
[1022.08] all these toys should be cleaned daily.
[1024.76] I shouldn’t get to see any mistakes.
[1026.52] Yes, yes, madam, I understand. 
Don’t worry.
[1031.28] Urooj, how did you like it?
[1036.44] It is good,
[1038.56] but there is no one to play with 
these toys right now.
[1041.68] Hey, we will get the news today, 
so think that a baby will be in this home.
[1050.44] Then you are giving me 
good news, right?
[1062.16] I think you have some misunderstanding.
[1065.76] The test you got done for me,
it doesn’t mean that.
[1073.28] It is to check if I can become 
a mother or not.
[1078.92] Now don’t confuse me with these 
difficult things. Understand?
[1083.44] I know well what I have to do and 
what I don’t have to do.
[1086.88] You stay quiet. 
Be completely quiet.
[1094.32] Wasai, you have to set all these toys
in the room. Understand?
[1098.04] There should be no mistake.
[1100.00] Yes, elder madam, don’t worry.
[1102.72] What you have said will happen.
[1121.68] Little madam, don’t be sad.
[1125.88] God will be kind and very soon 
you will get to hear a good news.
[1200.96] Salman’s friend Alizay came home
suddenly and then she stayed too.
[1206.16] They have such close friendship?
[1211.00] I don’t think all this is right.
[1213.08] I don’t think this is right,
[1216.32] but maybe we are mistaken.
[1219.08] It is possible we are thinking wrong.
[1228.24] I don’t know why my heart is 
so worried today,
[1232.12] like something is going to happen.
[1239.04] Something big.
[1245.04] Alizay coming to this home.
[1248.96] At least it is not good for Urooj 
in any way.
[1270.76] Wasai, you have to set all these toys 
in the entire room
[1274.16] and yes, the pictures 
I have sent for framing,
[1277.00] as soon as they come,
[1278.16] you have to put them in front 
of madam Urooj on the bed.
[1281.04] Urooj, whenever you get up and
 see those pictures,
[1283.64] you will see, really beautiful children 
will be born.
[1288.28] Then you are giving me 
good news, right?
[1293.48] I think you have some misunderstanding.
[1297.08] The test you got done for me,
it doesn’t mean that.
[1303.12] It is to check if I can become
a mother or not.
[1308.72] Now don’t confuse me with these 
difficult things. Understand?
[1313.40] I know well what I have to do and 
what I don’t have to do.
[1316.84] You stay quiet. Be completely quiet.
[1333.08] Come in.
[1337.08] Little madam,
[1339.24] madam Shanzay has come.
[1341.12] I have seated her 
in the drawing room.
[1345.12] Fine, I will come.
[1346.92] Sure, madam.
[1348.48] In fact, listen, Wasai.
[1351.04] Yes, madam?
[1354.56] You bring her to my room.
[1356.52] Fine, little madam, I will bring her.
[1380.12] Come in.
[1383.36] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[1387.12] This is a slip for your lab.
[1391.32] Yes, absolutely, this is a slip 
from our lab,
[1393.68] but you will get this report 
in the evening.
[1397.92] Doctor, I didn’t come to collect 
the reports from you.
[1404.64] I came to talk to you about 
something important.
[1410.60] Look, I don’t like beating 
about the bush,
[1414.36] I am very straight forward.
[1418.28] Okay, then go ahead.
[1421.52] Have a seat.
[1425.36] Thank you.
[1434.00] Doctor, I wanted to talk to you that
[1437.56] you change these reports 
as per my liking.
[1448.08] and what is your liking?
[1452.84] Doctor, you just have to mention
in the reports,
[1457.40] that Urooj can never be a mother.
[1463.48] Making changes in the reports
is a crime.
[1467.84] It is a crime.
[1471.00] And I cannot do this.
[1474.40] Only you can do this.
[1480.40] You will do my work, 
and I will do your work.
[1488.64] And you know, doctor,
[1491.88] this is how the world operates.
[1495.28] Give some, take some.
[1509.40] Okay,
[1511.72] but what is your benefit in this?
[1527.12] Come.
[1533.12] Oh wow, Urooj.
[1537.80] All this?
[1545.48] This means that I am going 
to become an aunt?
[1554.12] There is nothing like that.
[1558.40] If there is nothing like that, 
then why all this?
[1563.88] Look Urooj, you can tell me, 
you will not get my evil eye.
[1570.08] What are you saying, man?
[1572.56] Why would I hide anything from you?
[1579.80] All this is happening because of 
aunt Mehreen.
[1586.68] Then, why all this?
[1590.84] She got my medical test done,
[1593.56] to find out if I can be a mother or not?
[1599.72] But,
[1601.00] I don’t understand she has made 
the environment of the home so intense,
[1605.24] as if the test has been done to check 
if I am pregnant or not.
[1611.24] Although the test has been conducted 
to see if I can be a mother or not.
[1614.92] I don’t understand anything, Shanzay.
[1617.68] Oh my God,
[1619.72] this means that she is thinking 
this is a pregnancy report,
[1624.40] and that is why all these toys are here?
[1628.32] Yes,
[1630.96] you understand it correctly.
[1634.80] She does what she thinks
[1638.48] and no one in the home can even
try to prove her wrong.
[1645.48] Leave it.
[1651.48] I will ask Wasai to bring tea for you.
[1656.00] Sure.
[1672.32] Have something, buddy.
[1674.24] Man, I will just have tea 
in a little while.
[1678.44] Okay listen. 
Yes?
[1679.92] I wanted to talk to you about something.
[1681.56] Tell me, I came to talk to you 
after so long.
[1687.60] A friend of Salman, Alizay, has come 
to live in the home, from America.
[1693.80] You are telling me something 
so important now?
[1698.64] There is nothing special about it.
[1702.52] Really? How is she?
[1706.48] She is good. She is pretty.
[1709.36] She is modern and blunt as well.
[1715.28] Then it seems dangerous to me.
[1717.56] Come on, nothing like that.
[1720.08] If there is nothing like that, Urooj,
[1721.68] then why are you talking about that 
poor thing, making such a bad face?
[1726.12] Because you know 
I never like such girls.
[1731.36] What girls? I mean,
[1733.56] she came from America, 
that’s how everyone is.
[1747.64] And how long will she stay?
[1749.80] No idea.
[1752.08] Anyway, leave it. Have tea. 
Yes.
[1754.56] It is getting cold.
[1762.28] Hello.
[1763.76] Greetings. 
Greetings. How are you?
[1766.40] I am sure, you are Alizay.
[1770.52] Shanzay, this is Alizay and Alizay, 
this is Shanzay, my best friend.
[1776.52] Uh-huh.
[1778.32] Nice to meet you Shanzay.
[1781.44] Same here. 
Come, sit with us.
[1783.96] No, no, thank you.
[1785.76] I would have surely sat, 
but I have a headache,
[1788.60] so I will rest. Okay?
[1792.92] By the way,
[1795.44] Urooj make me a cup of coffee, 
please.
[1798.08] I will ask Wasai.
[1799.68] Wasai doesn’t know 
how to make coffee,
[1804.44] so you make it.
[1811.16] I am busy right now, my friend is over,
[1814.48] and it will not be possible for me.
[1835.76] Did you see?
[1837.84] Yes, I saw everything and 
also understood it too.
[1844.64] Now you don’t have to tell me
anything about this madam,
[1848.56] I will tell you everything.
[1881.20] Urooj,
[1883.04] what sort of a girl are you?
[1885.04] What happened aunty?
[1886.08] Don’t you guests in your home?
[1889.60] Did your mother not teach you 
how to take care of guests?
[1895.40] Alizay is Salman’s friend
[1897.72] and you said no to giving her coffee?
[1900.44] Aunty, Wasai was at home,
[1902.44] but Alizay said no…
So, you should have made it.
[1907.12] I was sitting with my friend.
[1909.56] Okay,
[1911.12] your friend is important,
[1913.12] but my Salman’s friend is not important?
[1917.72] Now I cannot give you any answer 
for this question.
[1921.40] Look Urooj,
[1922.68] Alizay is a guest and Salman’s friend,
[1927.08] in future, you shouldn’t make such a 
mistake or else I will not forgive you.
[1975.48] So you have thought that
[1977.72] you will prove through the reports 
that Urooj cannot be a mother.
[1982.04] Of course, that’s how it is.
[1986.76] But all this would be temporary, right?
[1990.92] Meaning?
[1993.12] Meaning that Urooj can be 
a mother at any time.
[1996.40] Maybe next week.
[2000.60] So you are afraid that if you do this,
[2005.64] then your lab’s report will be spoiled?
[2008.44] No,
[2010.16] there is nothing like that.
[2014.64] I am just trying to make you understand
[2017.88] that the value of the reports 
is just a piece of paper.
[2023.80] In reality, Urooj can be a mother.
[2032.88] Then you tell me, doctor,
[2036.76] what should we do in such a situation?
[2042.28] I will prescribe a medication to you,
[2044.96] you will have to give that medication
to Urooj once in the week.
[2050.76] Till she keeps on taking 
that medication,
[2053.12] there will be no chances of pregnancy.
[2073.84] This completes your work,
[2078.32] and my work?
[2084.12] Hmmm.
[2086.32] Tell me your account number, doctor.
[2097.92] Sent.
[2099.28] Please check your phone.
[2114.92] Good.
[2116.92] Very good.
[2145.56] How is this girl making the people 
of the home her own
[2149.64] and turning everyone against me.
[2152.52] She is really cunning.
[2156.96] She has gotten an idea that aunt Mehreen’s
 behaviour towards me is not good at all,
[2165.08] and she knows this is my weak point,
[2168.36] from where she wants to start this game.
[2187.40] Hello.
[2189.64] You were absolutely right, Shanzay.
[2192.44] What happened, Urooj?
[2195.00] Alizay has found out aunt’s behavior 
towards me,
[2201.16] and that is why she is creating 
differences between us.
[2206.28] So, she wants to cause you a big harm 
through aunt Mehreen’s help.
[2211.28] and you know,
[2213.20] Salman considers Alizay really bold 
and straight forward girl.
[2218.60] Man, that girl is a straight fire.
[2222.60] But,
[2225.36] what is the reason behind her 
doing all this?
[2228.56] Her target is brother Salman.
[2232.24] Salman has no such thing 
for Alizay in his heart.
[2235.68] But she is trying that according 
to the things you are telling me.
[2243.72] So then what should I do?
[2245.68] Urooj, keep your eyes and ears open.
[2249.56] At times when you cannot call love, love,
[2253.28] then you have to give it some 
other name and love.
[2260.04] Fine, I will call you later.
[2263.32] Take care of yourself.
[2264.92] Goodbye.
[2266.28] Goodbye.
