[43.00] Child, both your mothers think
[45.70] that we should get Areej through 
the help of the police.
[49.57] What is your opinion?
[53.57] You were saying that you are
 thinking something.
[58.97] Yes, I am thinking.
[61.80] But Naseema and sister Mehreen 
are saying we do a case.
[70.63] I just want my Areej back.
[75.40] Can I ask you something, child?
[79.63] Go ahead.
[81.17] Do you want to live with Salman,
[86.00] after what he did with you 
and your mama.
[98.17] Child, I don’t understand 
the meaning of your silence,
[101.83] whether it is a yes, or a no.
[124.47] Arooj,
[125.80] child, what are you thinking?
[139.63] Nothing, mama,
[141.63] I was just thinking about Areej.
[144.40] Arooj, sit down, child.
[147.27] Thinking like this doesn’t 
solve problems.
[161.57] Arooj,
[166.07] where did your father go?
[169.13] Where did he go, meaning?
[171.70] Yes, Arooj,
[173.57] Master Shoaib has been 
gone for long.
[176.07] Did he say something to you
 before leaving?
[178.43] I don’t know where papa is,
[180.37] in fact, I don’t know when 
and where he went.
[191.07] Okay, you call him.
[193.63] Yes, I will call him.
[212.80] Hey, phone….
See!
[215.17] He even left his phone here.
[218.57] Now God forbid, 
if we have the need,
[222.00] then where will we call?
[225.30] Sister Naseema,
[230.20] don’t worry.
[231.47] He must have gone for some important
 work, he will come back.
[235.50] Yes, I remember,
[237.43] papa had to go for my work as well.
[240.20] He was saying he has a plan, 
maybe, he went there.
[243.97] No matter what sister Mehreen,
[245.73] he should inform us and go.
[247.97] You get worried.
[249.83] Why are you worried, mama?
[252.13] This way the worry will 
increase more.
[256.20] You worry, child.
[258.87] You know your papa doesn’t 
stay well either.
[263.90] You get weird thoughts 
in your heart.
[267.37] Where can he go?
[270.00] Don’t worry,
[271.67] God will make it all fine.
[328.43] I want to make my final attempt.
[332.83] Maybe, I will be able to 
change Salman’s heart.
[338.93] Then the path of this last attempt 
doesn’t pass from the police station.
[347.97] I will try my best to save my home.
[354.70] Even after so much happened?
[369.90] Only for the sake of my daughter.
[375.27] I think the same.
[379.60] You have reduced the burden 
on my heart by saying this.
[418.27] I want all the account details 
on my table tomorrow.
[420.70] And the meeting we had 
with Ahmad Association.
[422.67] Sir? 
Get it fixed.
[424.30] Okay sir.
[431.87] He still hasn’t left.
[434.87] Sir, he is waiting for you 
for a long time.
[439.30] He is a really stubborn man.
[445.40] Check if he is dead.
[457.93] Sir.
[460.87] Forgive me,
[462.50] I am not well, 
that’s why I fell asleep.
[467.43] Is Mr. Salman free?
[469.77] Sir has left.
[474.77] He left?
[476.40] But I had to meet him.
[479.37] When did he leave?
[481.53] Just a minute back.
[483.83] Okay, thank you. I will see.
[492.43] God knows what worry the poor thing
 would have been in.
[496.43] He sat all day long
[498.70] and Mr. Salman didn’t meet him.
[509.40] Give me the keys.
[510.93] Sit.
[514.70] Salman.
[516.13] Salman.
[520.60] I came to meet you.
[523.63] You are lying.
[526.17] You didn’t come to meet me, 
in fact, you came to sleep.
[534.30] I didn’t meet you so that 
your sleep doesn’t get disturbed.
[536.57] I am not well, so I dozed off.
[552.47] So if you are not well, 
then go to the doctor,
[555.43] what did you come to me for?
[558.53] Right now you are the doctor.
[561.50] You have the cure for our sorrow.
[565.57] What is this informality?
[568.60] Don’t you have manners 
on how to talk?
[575.13] I apologize, sir.
[580.80] I just came to say that
[584.57] don’t ruin Arooj’s home.
[589.43] What do you mean?
[591.77] I have ruined it?
[594.77] How dare you say something 
to useless to me?
[598.70] Actually,
[600.40] Areej is also with you,
[603.13] so Arooj is crying continuously.
[607.50] Have mercy on her.
[611.17] There is still time.
[613.83] Leave from here, or else 
I will have the guard drag you out.
[618.93] Don’t do that.
[620.53] My daughter will go mad.
[624.67] Really?
[627.07] So, she is your daughter?
[637.87] With what relation?
[642.87] You can say anything,
[645.33] but don’t separate Areej 
and Arooj from you.
[648.83] Please.
[652.97] Don’t try to dictate me.
[658.20] Get out of here.
[776.47] Son,
[778.03] I had to come to you 
to thank you,
[782.60] but I had gotten unwell, 
so I couldn’t come.
[787.10] Oh,
[789.00] so, how are you feeling now?
[791.57] Thank God, now I am fine.
[794.07] Okay.
[795.40] Master, constantly praises you.
[800.30] Son, you did such a good deed.
[803.37] You have helped the children.
[805.33] Hey, no,
[807.33] there is no need to praise me.
[809.40] This was my responsibility.
[811.77] Actually, today I need your help.
[817.80] Yes, go ahead, Mr. Salman.
[820.67] Actually,
[822.83] the thing is that
[827.20] I like your daughter.
[832.60] I have come for her proposal.
[836.57] If you people don’t have 
an objection, then.
[863.43] Papa,
[865.67] you were lying in the room,
[867.50] what was the need to come here?
[869.17] Child, my heart worries 
lying down for long.
[873.67] Sit comfortably.
[879.23] Are you fine?
[880.97] Yes, child, I am fine.
[883.27] How do you feel now?
[886.20] I feel better now, son.
[889.67] If you want, then should I take 
an appointment from another doctor?
[893.30] Get your checkup done again?
[895.33] No, son, there is no need for that,
[898.73] I am fine.
[902.10] It is just weakness,
[905.13] it will be fine with time.
[909.57] She is a daughter,
[911.80] she worries quickly.
[914.37] She finds a small illness of 
a father as really big.
[918.43] That’s what a daughter’s heart is like.
[1031.27] Arooj,
[1032.40] I think your father is here.
[1051.10] Is everything okay?
[1053.10] Why are you walking like this?
[1054.67] I am fine. I am fine.
[1065.17] Where did you go?
[1068.87] I went to meet Salman.
[1088.40] To meet Salman?
[1090.67] Why?
[1093.97] To talk about your issue.
[1118.40] I told him to save his home 
from being ruined.
[1135.23] Then? Then what did he say?
[1139.13] He cursed me.
[1158.40] And he pushed me down.
[1172.27] What?
[1174.40] Salman pushed you?
[1182.60] He has gathered so much courage?
[1196.63] I will deal with him.
[1198.03] Arooj, wait.
[1200.57] Where are you going at this hour?
[1213.60] Don’t stop me today, mama.
[1221.00] Because if I don’t go today,
[1223.73] then I will never be able to go.
[1239.33] Stop, Arooj.
[1242.33] Arooj, child. Arooj.
[1248.63] God, what is happening?
[1327.27] You pushed my father? Huh?
[1329.63] You pushed him?
[1331.40] Push me. Hit me.
[1333.90] Why don’t you hit me?
[1335.93] What do you think of yourself?
[1337.43] What is this arrogance for?
[1339.77] Respect. Fame.
[1341.53] Why are you quiet? Speak up.
[1343.47] Lower your voice.
[1346.27] This is my home,
[1348.10] you are not allowed 
to talk loudly here.
[1350.43] I will talk loudly.
[1353.27] And what is this home 
you are talking about?
[1357.20] Two minutes.
[1358.67] The ground from under your feet 
will be pulled in two minutes.
[1366.87] Areej.
[1368.80] Areej.
[1370.67] You cannot take Areej.
[1372.20] You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother.
[1374.17] I will stop you.
Leave me.
[1375.80] Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it.
[1377.40] Leave it…
[1388.37] Arooj.
[1396.67] How dare you raise your hand
 at my son?
[1401.53] A mother has slapped him 
for her daughter.
[1410.53] But how will you understand this?
[1413.77] If you take Areej from here,
then I will kill you.
[1418.23] You will kill me?
[1420.13] Kill me.
[1425.10] Kill me.
[1426.33] Shoot.
[1427.63] Why don’t you shoot?
[1429.00] Murder me.
[1430.40] Tell Areej that a mother sacrificed
her life for her daughter.
[1436.27] Shoot.
[1437.60] Come on, shoot.
[1439.73] Hey, leave it. 
Coward.
[1441.83] How will you shoot someone?
[1445.37] It will cost you a lot to take Areej.
[1448.67] I am not a businessperson 
like you people,
[1451.07] that I will account for cheap
and expensive.
[1453.83] I am a mother.
[1455.37] If you take Areej from here, 
you will have to face a lot of loss.
[1459.53] I will divorce you.
[1460.90] You can do what you want.
[1470.37] I am not afraid of anything now.
[1474.63] I will take my daughter from here.
[1477.43] I will see how you take her...
No
[1478.93] What is all this? 
What is going on?
[1480.57] Idrees, this Arooj did all this drama.
[1484.13] She slapped Salman.
[1486.27] Shaista. Salman.
[1488.73] You people go to the room.
[1490.13] But she is taking Areej.
[1492.47] I told you to go to the room.
[1496.07] Dad, I won’t leave her.
[1498.97] Salman. Go.
[1501.47] Go. Go to the room right now.
[1503.03] Okay, come on. Come, son.
[1505.50] Mom…
Come on. Come on.
[1583.87] Look child, 
how she is misbehaving…
[1585.63] Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future.
[1589.07] Look here. 
Salman. Salman.
[1591.37] Do you have no manners to talk?
[1594.17] I will drag you out…
Salman. Salman, no.
[1596.63] Leave me, papa. 
No.
[1598.10] Why are you stopping him?
[1599.77] What will you do with me? Huh?
[1603.40] Why did you stop? 
What do you think?
[1606.27] I will get scared of this action of yours?
[1611.57] I am not afraid of anyone.
[1613.43] All of you hear me carefully.
[1615.30] Stop your nonsense.
[1617.67] I will throw you out of 
this home right now.
[1619.77] This home belongs to me 
and my mother’s home.
[1628.07] No one can drag us out of here.
[1630.33] Do you people understand?
[1632.07] Hear me out clearly.
[1634.27] This home belongs to me 
and my mother’s home.
[1731.60] Is everything okay?
[1733.73] Why are you walking like this?
[1735.30] I am fine. I am fine.
[1740.17] Where did you go?
[1743.87] I went to meet Salman.
[1753.50] To meet Salman?
[1755.73] Why?
[1759.00] To talk about your issue.
[1770.70] I told him to save his home 
from being ruined.
[1780.57] Then? 
Then what did he say?
[1784.27] He cursed me.
[1793.67] And he pushed me down.
[1819.90] You cannot take Areej.
[1821.20] You cannot keep a daughter 
away from her mother.
[1823.60] I will stop you.
Leave me.
[1825.10] Leave my hand. 
I will not leave it.
[1826.53] Leave it…
[1830.77] Arooj.
[1834.93] How dare you raise 
your hand at my son?
[1839.73] A mother has slapped him 
for her daughter.
[1844.40] But how will you understand this?
[1847.60] If you take Areej from here, 
then I will kill you.
[1891.90] It will cost you a lot to take Areej.
[1895.20] I am not a businessperson
like you people,
[1897.67] that I will account for cheap
and expensive.
[1900.47] I am a mother.
[1901.90] If you take Areej from here, 
you will have to face a lot of loss.
[1906.13] I will divorce you.
