[55.96] Did you call me here to show me 
this game with the paper weight?
[70.12] My life has become a game.
[72.92] And what about you playing around 
with relations?
[74.96] In fact, you are playing around 
with your life.
[81.24] What are you looking at?
[86.32] What has happened to you, Salman?
 Why are you acting so childish?
[96.52] You are such a big businessman
[99.48] and you went to that boy’s home?
[106.32] Have you ever loved?
[109.72] No,
[111.00] but why mention this here?
[114.68] There is a reason.
[117.72] But when you have never loved,
[122.56] how will you understand this?
[124.16] Okay please,
[125.52] let’s not talk about philosophy, 
okay?
[128.04] Let’s talk about something simple.
[130.88] You have insulted your relation with 
sister-in-law by going to Ammad’s home.
[136.56] My love has been insulted.
[141.72] I wanted an answer.
[143.16] So you went to his home to ask
 for an answer?
[151.96] And tell me something,
[157.96] a stranger
[161.32] will testify for your wife’s character? 
Huh?
[168.60] And whatever answer he gives you, 
will you accept it?
[171.64] Then what should I have done? 
Tell me.
[173.60] At least you shouldn’t have
 done this.
[181.16] This is a delicate relation,
[188.60] if you bang it on the ground 
so many times,
[192.04] I am telling you honestly,
it will break.
[196.16] Please man,
[198.68] don’t bother me more, 
I am already really worried.
[202.36] I am bothering you?
[210.84] I am supporting you.
[229.32] You didn’t answer me.
[232.24] Mr. Salman, believe me,
[235.68] this hot tea is more important 
than your question.
[239.40] Drink it.
[246.04] And believe me,
[249.84] Arooj is a good girl.
[267.56] Ammad, I don’t understand 
something.
[269.68] What?
[270.96] Arooj used to be so lively earlier,
[273.96] now she has become so quiet.
[276.72] Because the situation she is facing,
[279.64] in such situation people 
often get quiet.
[282.48] No, she is trying to improve 
the situation,
[285.48] but brother Salman has so many 
misunderstandings in his heart.
[288.92] Why don’t you remove those 
misunderstandings?
[291.40] Really? How?
[294.56] How do I remove them?
[298.04] When Arooj tells Salman, 
I am her friend,
[301.20] he doesn’t listen to her.
[303.12] I told Salman, Arooj is my friend, 
he doesn’t believe me.
[307.12] He only listens and agrees to those 
people who give her wrong advice.
[311.04] That’s it.
[311.76] Really?
[312.84] So this means we cannot do anything 
for our friend
[317.88] that all the misunderstandings are 
removed from brother Salman’s heart?
[320.80] What do we do?
[322.16] When Salman doesn’t want to remove
all these misunderstandings himself,
[325.48] then what can we do?
[328.16] But,
[330.56] we will have to do something.
[332.20] When will you do it?
When the time will pass?
[335.04] No.
[336.64] Before the time passes.
[338.84] Yes, but when?
[343.32] Today.
[344.80] Come on.
[422.88] You say Arooj is your love.
[424.96] Yes, absolutely.
[427.96] That’s how it is.
[429.76] Then why do two loving people 
need advice?
[433.72] Or you can that why are the discussions 
between two people who love going out even?
[437.96] It is useless to take advice from you.
[441.72] Man, why do you even need advice 
from me or anyone else?
[450.84] You two sit on one page,
[453.08] you will find a solution.
[458.12] I don’t want to face her.
[460.24] Lies.
[462.12] It is not about facing her. 
Your ego is at its peak.
[466.40] So she too has made this 
a matter of her ego.
[470.36] Why does she not resolve 
this issue it with me?
[473.20] You surprise me, Salman.
[475.12] You started the issue and 
sister-in-law should end it?
[478.84] Do you see any logic in this?
[481.08] So if Arooj does this, 
then what will happen?
[483.08] What difference will it make?
[484.52] Then Salman you bury this.
[491.40] Nasir, you know me for a long time,
[496.28] even if I want, I won’t be 
able to do this.
[508.72] Arooj, preference tells you 
about love.
[512.68] And I can have any number 
on your priority list,
[517.08] but not the first.
[522.92] Hmmm.
[529.28] You have the last number.
[535.44] Because when the list is made 
on the name of one person,
[539.76] so the first and last number 
is the same.
[570.56] Fine, I have seen the plan, 
you get it printed
[574.88] and tell Mr. Ahmad to contact me.
[577.40] Right, sir.
[581.52] Hello.
[589.92] Send him.
[596.20] Right sir. 
Thank you.
[615.80] Have a seat.
[618.12] Please.
[624.40] Thank you.
[626.20] This is Shanzay.
[631.04] I know this.
[632.28] No, you don’t know.
[636.88] I know this is Shanzay.
[644.12] If there is anything else 
apart from this tell me.
[647.80] You have introduced her, 
but also tell me
[651.16] why you have come here.
[654.96] I have the debt of an answer,
[657.84] I came to remove that.
[659.44] So, then why didn’t you remove 
the burden
[661.72] when I had asked you.
[663.56] Because I answer on time, 
and that time has come now.
[669.00] What are you people talking 
about here?
[671.16] Maybe I am present here, right?
[673.48] So involve me too.
[676.04] Of course,
[678.24] this thing cannot be completed 
without involving you.
[686.48] So, Mr. Salman,
[688.76] should I introduce Shanzay 
to you completely?
[696.28] Shanzay,
[698.60] is my future wife.
[714.56] I am telling you this first, 
even before Shanzay.
[735.44] Because I know this really well
[739.96] that you would be the happiest 
to know this.
[752.44] Anyway,
[754.68] goodbye.
[758.84] Shanzay.
[830.84] You didn’t like me going there, 
right?
[833.56] I didn’t like you going there and 
talking about that thing.
[840.48] It is surprising.
[844.20] I asked him, 
he didn’t respond to me.
[846.80] I am asking you, 
you are not responding.
[848.68] Because what you say is baseless,
[851.56] there can be no answer for it.
[854.12] And even if you get the answer,
[857.40] then will you recommend the punishment
for it yourself or will I do it?
[880.88] These people like Ammad 
consider me stupid.
[892.44] I am the CEO of such a
big business empire.
[901.36] Shanzay didn’t know 
Ammad is marrying her.
[916.72] The surprise on her face 
made it evident
[919.08] that Ammad thought of it 
at this moment to fool me
[927.12] and he said it on the next moment,
[934.04] that he is marrying Shanzay.
[962.72] What happened? 
What are you thinking?
[968.88] At times you should see things 
as much as they are visible.
[975.20] You don’t have to look at a beautiful 
painting on the wall and think
[978.84] that the paint on the wall behind 
the painting is falling off.
[986.96] At times, you should move away 
from the issue, considering it a reason.
[1041.12] Leave my hand.
[1043.60] Ammad, what did you inside?
[1045.92] Why?
[1047.44] What did I do?
[1050.28] Ammad, you told brother Salman 
you are marrying me
[1053.24] and I don’t know about this.
[1056.52] Why?
[1057.60] Did I not do good or 
you don’t like me?
[1061.52] I do.
[1063.40] Meaning, I like you,
[1066.16] but what is this style of expressing 
your love?
[1069.88] What can I do? 
This is my style.
[1074.48] Really?
[1075.84] If this is your style, then 
what will happen next?
[1079.32] What will happen next is that 
Salman will never bother Arooj.
[1091.12] So, this means you did 
all this for Arooj.
[1096.44] Hmmm..
[1098.72] you can say that.
[1101.60] Hmmm.
[1103.12] Okay.
[1107.00] Meaning, this was my 
misunderstanding.
[1109.92] I thought you really love me.
[1112.64] Stupid girl, call your mother
[1115.64] and ask her where my mother is
 right now.
[1119.28] No way.
[1121.44] Call her.
[1130.64] Hello mama.
[1132.60] Mama, where are you right now?
[1139.32] What?
[1146.12] Hey, okay mama, 
I will talk to you later.
[1148.56] Okay. Goodbye.
[1151.28] See. Did you see?
[1153.04] I can’t believe this.
How is this possible?
[1216.88] I wanted to come myself 
for so many days,
[1219.40] but something or the other 
would happen.
[1221.96] But today when you called, 
then I thought I will surely go today.
[1227.32] Look sister, as per principle,
[1229.96] I should have come to your home.
[1233.32] But my ailment hasn’t 
left me capable.
[1237.12] No problem, I have come, 
it is the same thing.
[1241.12] Actually,
[1242.76] I wanted to talk to you 
about something.
[1245.80] Go ahead.
[1248.16] Shanzay and Ammad are 
really good friends,
[1251.92] I want that we convert their friendship
 into a relation.
[1257.44] This is a good thing,
[1259.28] I really like Ammad as well, 
he is a good boy.
[1263.64] Shanzay is dear to me 
like my daughter.
[1268.04] I want that I see the happiness 
of my children in my life.
[1272.52] You cannot trust life.
[1275.68] Why are you saying this?
[1277.24] Hey, we have to see the happiness 
of our children
[1280.88] and also the happiness of 
our grandchildren.
[1284.80] Don’t worry, God will make it fine.
[1288.40] You kept my word.
[1290.80] Have tea.
[1292.68] Yes, sure.
[1298.36] I really apologize.
[1300.52] I am not well or else I would have 
cared for you well.
[1303.68] Hey, hey, no, no, this is also enough.
Don’t think that.
[1343.56] I want to talk to you.
[1346.20] You don’t want to talk about anything,
[1348.68] you have to ask.
[1351.80] Obviously,
[1354.24] you question a criminal.
[1358.64] Criminal?
[1362.32] I am not even accused,
[1364.04] and you called me a criminal 
without investigation.
[1367.72] Wow.
[1368.84] Really?
[1372.16] Fine, then.
[1373.92] We will investigate.
[1377.32] You didn’t like me going there, right?
[1403.36] Greetings.
[1406.64] Greetings.
[1410.44] It is good you came. 
Come on, have a seat.
[1432.08] Salman, I want to talk to you 
about something important.
[1437.64] Yes, go ahead.
[1442.48] I have made a decision.
[1447.40] What decision?
[1449.96] I want to call Arooj’s parents home.
[1457.12] What for?
[1459.20] You really disliked Arooj’s parents 
coming over.
[1465.16] I am calling them to talk about 
what I don’t like.
[1470.44] and I know what that is.
[1474.08] If you know it, then why 
do you have an objection?
[1480.52] Let me do what I want to do. 
You will not do this at all.
[1489.32] And you will not contact 
Arooj’s parents at all.
[1493.84] Meaning,
[1495.56] you are ordering your mother.
[1497.64] I am not ordering you.
[1500.64] I just want to save this home 
from a bad decision.
[1503.56] If you want to save this home, 
then agree to me.
[1509.20] I cannot agree to you.
[1516.36] My life is attached to this,
[1519.72] that is why you accept my decision.
[1525.48] I feel…
[1527.48] I feel that your life and all decisions 
connected to our life are completely opposite.
[1574.36] That’s not true, Mehreen, I had told
 Salman everything about Arooj.
[1578.08] I had told him, that Arooj is…is…
[1584.00] Meaning, she is such a good girl,
[1586.52] she understands the matters,
[1588.80] in fact, she understands a few matters 
in depth. Yes.
[1594.24] What are the matters in the depth 
of which
[1596.80] that Arooj can reach, but I have 
not reached there till now?
[1601.64] Actually, the thing is Mehreen, 
if I go back in depth,
[1605.00] I will not return.
[1744.00] Stop.
[1750.40] Give me your hand.
[1757.12] Give me your hand.
[1803.80] Sorry.
[1808.56] After so much humiliation
[1810.52] you feel that a simple ‘sorry’ 
will finish this all,
[1815.56] and I will forget everything.
[1818.16] And this?
[1819.64] What is this for? 
Reason?
[1823.16] I didn’t like saying only sorry to you.
[1828.12] So I thought I would give you
 this gift.
[1831.60] and I didn’t like this style 
of yours at all.
[1834.52] Will I forget my insult 
seeing this gift?
[1837.36] Arooj, I can understand. 
It is my fault. I admit.
[1841.00] I am embarrassed on my thinking.
[1844.44] But I am saying sorry, 
I made a mistake. Please.
[1848.92] I am really sorry, 
it will not happen again.
[1853.64] You know,
[1856.40] Ammad came to the office today.
[1865.40] Ammad?
[1868.32] Why did Ammad come?
[1870.48] Your friend Shanzay.
[1873.52] Yes?
[1877.40] She and Ammad are getting married.
[1880.20] They are getting married?
[1886.04] Who told you?
[1888.36] She is your friend, 
did she not tell you?
[1892.08] Yes, both of them like each other, 
I know that.
[1896.56] But I didn’t know 
they are getting married.
[1901.08] Okay leave them, 
why talk about them?
[1905.20] Today, we will only talk about 
each other.
[1907.32] We spent a lot of time without 
happiness, Arooj.
[1916.60] I am really sorry.
[1919.00] Whatever happened, 
I am responsible for it.
[1922.80] But it will not happen again.
[1927.20] You alone are not responsible,
[1934.00] it is because of some people
[1936.76] and a little because of us.
[1941.92] Okay leave it.
[1944.72] We are going for a dinner.
[1950.32] Let me get fresh.
[1953.56] You too get ready.
[2024.88] Oh wow, wow.
[2028.24] You two are together.
[2030.52] Where are you going?
[2032.92] Salman is taking me for dinner.
[2035.40] Dinner?
[2037.96] Excuse me.
[2039.48] You do one thing, you talk to aunt 
and come outside.
[2041.96] I am waiting for you outside. 
Sure.
[2044.52] Yes, Mr. Wahid.
[2048.08] You two are going for dinner?
[2049.96] Yes.
[2051.12] So did you two get the visa?
[2054.28] I mean did you take permission 
from Mehreen?
[2057.60] You know, Salman gifted this to me.
[2061.32] See.
[2062.80] It looks so nice.
[2075.40] Look at this, mama.
[2081.64] Areej.
[2083.04] It is so pretty. See, Mehreen.
[2088.68] It is a really pretty name.
[2091.56] So you gave her the name you like.
[2094.56] Yes,
[2096.20] because Areej is a really 
pretty name.
[2098.56] Right, mama?
[2099.88] Yes, it is a really pretty name.
[2103.44] Now our home will become pleasant
because of her scent.
[2111.00] Here mama, make Areej wear this
with your own hands.
[2114.44] I will open it.
[2117.52] My beloved doll.
[2119.52] Here you go.
[2186.24] Aunt, what are you thinking?
[2188.84] Nothing.
[2190.16] I was thinking how you did 
this magic…
[2191.92] this magic of love I mean.
[2195.20] After dinner you will tell everything 
in detail.
[2199.16] I will ask both of you separately.
[2201.36] Salman is a cheater when it comes 
to telling a story.
[2204.72] Okay fine, Goodbye.
[2206.56] Yes. Goodbye.
