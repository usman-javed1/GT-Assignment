[33.44] I can say with surety
[36.32] that this girl Arooj’s desire is nothing
but greed for wealth and lies.
[51.64] Okay fine, we will accept for 
a few moments that
[55.12] the testimony of both the women is true 
and the copy of the stamp paper is fine.
[62.32] As for being the daughter of Waqar Ahmad
 and Mehreen Ahmad,
[65.60] who went missing twenty-two 
years ago,
[71.60] it was when Arooj Ahmad 
married Salman Ahmad
[74.96] and came to this home
[76.68] that she heard the story 
of a lost girl.
[79.00] She had greed in her mind,
[80.64] then she started getting herself called 
as a lost child, to seize the entire wealth.
[98.12] What will we do now, Arooj?
[100.64] Do whatever you want,
[104.44] it will be of no benefit.
[110.64] I will deprive you people of 
every single penny.
[121.76] There is still time Arooj,
[123.92] plead forgiveness from me.
[127.08] Who knows, I might forgive you.
[139.24] Salman, I know
[145.04] that I will win this case.
[151.56] But I will not be happy on 
winning this case.
[162.40] Whatever is going to be mine 
because of this win
[173.04] was never the target of my life.
[185.04] But,
[189.32] if you still win,
[196.80] then you will lose everything,
even after winning.
[234.88] Oh my God.
[237.36] I wish.
[238.48] I wish I was there,
[241.40] then I would have seen Arooj’s
and Mehreen’s long faces.
[250.80] What were those two idiots thinking
[257.04] that defeating Shaista is so easy?
[260.84] No, not at all. Shaista doesn’t have
the word ‘defeat’ in her dictionary.
[269.44] You do one thing, you come with us 
to the hearing day after tomorrow.
[272.16] See the drama that unfolds when 
the court’s decision in our favour.
[276.00] Arooj and Mehreen will have 
no respect left.
[281.48] You know, she acts so innocent
[286.68] and she is fighting a case 
against us?
[294.56] Hah,
[296.84] if I tell you the truth, at times 
I want to scratch both their faces.
[303.20] Whose face are you talking 
about scratching?
[306.72] Hey, Salman is also here. 
Come.
[309.40] Have some sweets son. 
Go ahead, have some sweets.
[312.44] No.
[318.04] Why? What happened?
[319.32] I will have sweets, the day Arooj 
comes back to this home crying.
[328.92] What do you want to do, Salman?
[332.64] Once we win this case,
[334.84] then I will file another case on them.
[340.08] Case for what?
[341.40] Anything.
[352.24] I just want that I drag Arooj 
to the court.
[359.40] My heart will find a lot of peace.
[367.92] Oh, revenge.
[369.88] Revenge.
[387.92] So, then you come for the 
hearing day after tomorrow.
[391.08] No,
[393.00] I will stay here and celebrate
our victory.
[398.60] Okay, as you wish.
[407.44] I am the owner of this business,
property and wealth.
[415.44] And I know this well.
[421.64] So my advice to you is,
[423.88] stop dreaming about it.
[428.92] It is just a matter of me going 
to the court,
[433.68] I will ruin the plan you made for
twenty five years in minutes.
[514.68] Arooj, don’t give up.
[518.16] Life is the name of fighting,
and constantly fighting.
[523.12] I am fighting, papa.
[527.68] But I had no idea those people 
would be so deceitful and cunning.
[535.80] You know, now I feel disgusted
 with myself,
[540.56] that how did I live in between 
such people for so long.
[546.20] Child, this is the world.
[549.48] Here wealth has become 
the faith for most people.
[553.72] They do not adhere to 
ethical principles
[556.00] when it comes to acquiring wealth
and resources.
[560.12] Yes, but a person has something
called conscience in them.
[565.84] Does that not bother them?
[569.72] Look, my daughter,
[571.88] this world is a place of lessons.
[575.44] People here may have 
a conscience,
[578.48] but it often turns into 
a lifeless body.
[587.80] And this is why their actions stink.
[591.28] Hmm,
[594.04] okay, how will you proceed?
[596.08] What will you do?
[601.64] I am thinking of that way.
[603.48] So do you see a way?
[609.68] You say yourself,
[612.36] if you stand strong on the path of honesty,
God makes the way Himself.
[623.20] That’s it,
[626.56] I am living on the hope 
of that light
[631.00] or else there is darkness 
all around.
[634.76] This darkness will get removed,
just stay strong.
[639.24] There is always a day 
after every night.
[675.08] Stop it now, Wasai.
[677.84] How long will you massage it for?
[680.16] No, elder madam,
[683.00] don’t stop me today.
[686.12] I got a chance to serve you 
after a long time.
[706.00] What are you looking 
at elder madam?
[713.40] When am I elder madam now?
[718.00] I have been sent away 
from my home.
[723.76] Don’t say that.
[726.64] I am completely sure,
[729.40] you will surely go back to 
that home one day.
[734.44] How are you sure, Wasai?
[737.92] God bless my mother.
[741.84] She used to say that
[745.08] the thing that belongs to a place,
[749.40] surely returns to it.
[753.68] And your place is in 
Mr. Waqar’s home.
[762.28] Wasai,
[765.24] how can people hide their 
cunningness for so long
[770.56] and meet others with a smile 
on their face,
[773.52] like,
[776.52] sister in law Shaista and 
brother Idrees did.
[783.68] People have a lot of colours.
[790.00] Like a chameleon.
[794.00] It took changes so many colours.
[802.88] When mama and Waqar were there,
that home was so lively.
[817.00] But,
[819.92] the greed of brother Idrees and 
sister in law Shaista ruined it.
[827.84] Okay don’t cry,
[830.76] be strong.
[833.80] Look at younger madam,
[838.00] she is competing with everyone so 
bravely, at such a young age.
[848.00] Yes, Wasai.
[851.76] Maybe, my daughter has been through
so much sorrow in this age,
[858.64] that maybe she feels no pain now.
[871.48] First me,
[874.32] her unlucky mother
[881.76] couldn’t protect her.
[886.28] I couldn’t keep her with me.
[893.16] Then I became her bad mother in law.
[900.60] I have given my daughter 
so many sorrows, right?
[905.56] No, elder madam,
[909.24] don’t say that now.
[912.60] What will you get by cursing 
yourself, now?
[917.32] A person can also make amends 
for their mistakes.
[923.88] You are right.
[931.64] Okay, tell me,
[935.52] when are you going to your village?
[938.60] No, no, elder madam,
[941.48] now I will not go anywhere.
[944.68] I will just lie here in some corner,
[948.24] with you people.
[951.12] I will serve you people all my life.
[955.24] I will not leave you people and go.
[958.72] I won’t go.
[975.00] Mr. Judge, this report 
clearly states that
[977.08] Mehreen Ahmad is a mental patient.
[983.96] Whatever stories she has told us,
[986.32] she has just wasted 
the court’s time with it.
[988.52] There is nothing in it 
that can be believable.
[1063.76] Mama, I am going for some work.
[1068.44] Where are you going, child?
[1074.72] To do the most important thing 
of my life.
[1078.00] I don’t understand.
[1081.32] Maybe no one understands.
[1091.40] I...
[1095.72] I needed some money.
[1098.36] Yes, yes, why not?
[1100.60] I have taken out money for you.
[1116.52] All the money I had was spent 
in the lawyer’s fees, mama.
[1126.48] I have no money left to spend.
[1131.40] Here you go.
[1149.24] Did I ask for any clarification?
[1156.40] I don’t need any reason to fulfill 
the need of my Arooj.
[1172.72] It is not enough, right?
[1181.20] Child, that’s all I have right now.
[1195.04] Okay, wait a minute,
I will just come.
[1219.80] Here you go.
[1228.08] Sell it.
[1235.00] Take it.
[1262.80] Mama, if I win the case,
[1265.88] I will get two more made for you.
[1272.16] God is great, child.
[1275.08] You, leave.
[1315.80] Thank you.
[1317.20] Goodbye, go.
[1344.48] May God give you courage, my child.
[1351.80] My Lord,
[1356.12] help my daughter.
[1380.20] The two witnesses Arooj presented 
to prove her innocence,
[1384.52] they are in front of you.
[1386.24] One of them is a mental patient,
[1388.00] and the other has an allegation 
of theft on her.
[1393.80] Apart from that, she has a 
copy of a paper,
[1396.60] according to which 
she is the owner.
[1399.08] And even the original document for 
that has still not been found, Mr. Judge.
[1433.76] Shall we go, mama?
[1435.56] Arooj, at least tell me 
where we have to go.
[1438.64] We don’t even have a hearing
at the court, today.
[1441.20] We have to go prepare 
for the hearing.
[1443.92] You come with me.
[1460.20] Nasir.
[1461.88] Nasir.
[1466.40] What is this, Salman? 
This is my office
[1469.24] and I have respect here.
[1472.24] So, this is also my life and I too have
a lot of respect in my life.
[1475.20] Talk openly and it would be better 
if you say it straight.
[1478.64] It is something simple,
[1480.72] it is you who is helping Arooj 
fight the case, right?
[1483.60] All this money is coming 
from your office, right?
[1485.64] Because the poor master Shoaib 
doesn’t have enough money
[1488.40] to spend on the case.
[1490.68] You are the one who is poor, Salman.
[1494.16] Why are you surprised?
[1495.72] You heard it right. 
You are the one who is poor,
[1498.40] who doesn’t have relations,
nor friends.
[1502.52] You are actually poor.
[1503.72] I didn’t come here to hear 
your philosophy.
[1506.12] Talk straight with me.
[1507.92] What did you come here 
to say, then?
[1511.44] I came to warn you.
[1513.84] Stop helping Arooj financially.
[1516.92] I am not helping sister in law Arooj,
financially.
[1520.00] In fact, she is helping us.
[1523.36] You had taken back tenders worth
ten million, right?
[1526.72] In return sister in law Arooj brought our 
company three times bigger the business.
[1533.32] Who is helping whom, now? 
Will you tell me?
[1535.96] And it is also the responsibility
of the company
[1538.40] to care for such employees,
that are worthy.
[1545.00] I will surely deal with Arooj,
[1549.04] but I will also deal with you.
[1576.28] But I will never consider you 
my enemy.
[1579.60] My friend.
[1594.96] Sister in law, Arooj, I have transferred
 some money in your account.
[1598.68] Please check.
[1602.60] Okay.
[1653.56] What have you brought, Shaista?
[1678.72] The corpse of the desires and 
hopes of Mehreen and Arooj.
[1691.20] I thought I would look at it for a while
and shed tears for a while.
[1699.28] Tears of happiness!
[1705.64] You really know how to enjoy 
the situation, Shaista.
[1709.48] You know, I want
[1712.24] that I take this picture and give it 
in Arooj’s hand. Go madam,
[1718.76] you want to become the owner 
of this wealth
[1722.84] and home on the basis of 
this picture, right?
[1729.60] Then fine,
[1731.12] go present this picture in the court,
[1733.72] and say that this infant is me,
[1738.96] then you will get everything.
That’s how it is right?
[1743.28] Hey, stop it, already.
[1744.60] How long will you celebrate
your victory? Huh?
[1767.84] All my life.
[1770.32] I will celebrate it all my life.
[1779.56] I wish.
[1782.76] I wish, this was a film or a drama,
[1790.88] then these two would have showed
this picture in the court.
[1894.96] Begin the proceedings of the case.
[1901.12] Legal representative of 
the defendant,
[1902.60] please present all the evidence 
against Arooj Ahmad,
[1905.32] who claims the ownership of 
the deceased Waqar Ahmad,
[1908.60] so that this case can be 
concluded today.
[1912.00] Please proceed.
[1913.16] Thank you, your honour.
[1915.28] Mr. Judge, before my closing argument,
[1919.60] I would surely want to call 
Arooj Ahmad here.
[1922.00] Permission granted.
[1967.56] Mr. Judge, my client Salman Ahmad 
is a reputable businessman
[1972.68] and a highly esteemed individual.
[1975.88] Upon his recommendation,
[1977.44] I have given Arooj Ahmad 
a final opportunity
[1985.84] to retract her false claim, 
expressing regret,
[1991.16] and gracefully withdraw from 
and take back this case.
[2010.92] And not only will there be a 
prosecution case against her,
[2014.40] but also, simultaneously, 
she will be liable to pay
[2017.16] a penalty for defamation against the 
honourable family of Salman Ahmad.
[2066.76] Mr. Judge, I stand strong on 
my claim even today.
[2070.76] I am the owner of this entire property.
[2090.52] This means,
[2092.48] now Arooj Ahmad will have 
to give evidence
[2095.64] that she is late Waqar Ahmad’s daughter.
[2098.68] Otherwise, our case is straight.
[2104.28] Thank you.
[2122.72] Mr. Judge,
[2125.48] what will they forgive me for 
conspiracy and defamation.
[2156.00] I forgive these people.
[2224.80] Mr. Judge,
[2226.88] this is Arooj Ahmad’s DNA report.
[2231.16] According to it,
[2233.60] Arooj Ahmad is the daughter of 
Waqar Ahmad and madam Mehreen.
[2256.84] Thus, there is no doubt.
[2259.12] And along with that there is also 
madam Mehreen’s medical report as well,
[2262.56] which clearly states that
she is mentally fit,
[2266.04] thus, her testimony cannot be denied
[2268.68] and that is already 
in the court’s record.
