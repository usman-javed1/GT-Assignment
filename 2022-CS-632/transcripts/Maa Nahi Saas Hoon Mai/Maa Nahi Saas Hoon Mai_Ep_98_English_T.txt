[46.08] So, then, tell me,
[48.28] how did you like shopping?
[52.08] You are really good.
[55.52] You too are really good.
[65.68] We spent such good 
time together after so long.
[69.48] I really liked it.
[71.36] Me too.
[73.24] Now quickly sign this file,
 so that
[75.32] the work on Areej textile
 starts from tomorrow.
[77.96] Yes, so tell me, 
where do I need to sign?
[80.72] Fine, you do it.
[81.92] Here is the pen.
[170.16] Come in...
[175.28] Younger madam,
[178.08] Areej is crying really badly.
[188.16] I tried a lot to make 
her get quiet,
[191.08] but she is not getting quiet.
[193.24] So, where is mama?
[195.04] I don’t know about that.
[196.88] I came to you.
[198.48] Oh no, okay, I will see.
[201.88] I will just come, Salman.
[203.80] Is she crying a lot?
[211.88] This paper is left.
[214.60] This idiot had to 
come right now.
[216.56] Mad woman.
[220.48] What should I do?
[221.72] She has not come till now.
[225.12] I will have to see.
[322.36] You, yourself are living 
in such a big home
[324.96] with your wife and son,
[326.80] that too with luxuries.
[328.92] You tell me,
[330.64] do you want to go and 
live in that home?
[333.04] Really?
[334.16] Can this really make 
me happen?
[336.84] Can this happen?
[339.04] Wife of mine, it is going 
to happen in a few days.
[342.56] I don’t understand anything.
[345.04] Hey, I told you I am 
coming from the lawyer.
[348.28] Shaista and Salman 
are thinking,
[349.68] I got the papers made
 in Salman’s name.
[354.28] Then?
[355.24] No one will even find out,
[357.28] as soon as Arooj signs,
 everything will be mine.
[360.40] That’s it, then 
I will leave Shaista.
[362.60] I have had enough of her, 
she has grown old.
[366.24] I know that.
[368.64] After all,
[370.28] I am in your life.
[373.16] Yes, that is true.
[375.64] Hey, I have to get to the office.
[377.84] I cannot let Salman talk to 
the lawyer directly at any cost.
[381.28] Or else the secret will be out.
[408.24] Yes, tell me, why did you call?
[410.84] Idrees,
[412.04] I wanted to ask
[413.76] if Arooj has put the wealth 
in your name or not?
[417.24] What nonsense is this?
[418.40] If there was something like this, 
I would tell you.
[421.08] But why are you 
scolding me, Idrees?
[428.56] What all have I not 
thought of for that wealth.
[433.36] I have dreamed of so much.
[440.40] How will we live in that home,
[442.32] what will we do?
[444.56] Okay. Okay. Fine,
[445.64] put down the phone.
[446.96] Don’t spoil it. 
Okay, goodbye.
[451.20] Id…rees.
[454.20] Why did Idrees 
disconnect the call?
[463.08] Yes, Shaista,
[464.68] what is the news?
[467.24] Salman will bring the good news.
[476.28] Then you will see
[479.24] what I do to this Arooj.
[483.68] I am dreaming of something else.
[486.72] Huh?
[488.16] What dreams?
[489.60] No, nothing.
[500.00] Son. Salman took 
a long time today.
[509.16] I will not be able to sleep
 out of happiness tonight.
[513.80] You are too much.
[517.52] Hard work will pay off today.
[519.60] I don’t know when he will come.
[575.40] Leave me.
[576.00] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[577.28] Leave me. Leave me.
[579.12] Listen to me. I am telling you,
[580.48] leave from here.
[581.64] Where do I go?
[582.48] To the home I bought you,
 where else?
[584.16] I will come and meet you.
[585.68] I am here, meet me here.
[588.00] Why are you insisting?
[589.08] We are living such a good life.
[590.72] We?
[591.96] Not we, only you and your first wife.
[595.04] You have put me on the side.
[597.24] I am telling you,
[598.08] I will fix everything, believe me.
[599.48] Enough.
[600.52] That’s it Idrees.
[601.64] I don’t believe you and 
your false promises now.
[605.56] I want respect for our
 relationship in society.
[608.24] Hey, so you announced it.
[609.56] Stop it now. Leave.
[610.88] Why should I go?
[612.64] I will not go from here.
[614.28] I am your wife
[615.36] and I want the right of
 being your wife.
[617.76] Wife?
[618.92] Will you live your life quietly or else,
[620.68] you will suffer all your life.
[621.84] You will not be able to prove 
that we have been married.
[654.12] This wedding is a secret wedding.
[656.36] Proving it is impossible.
[658.76] You have the wedding papers, right?
[660.28] That’s all my doing
[662.16] or else you said that
[663.52] what is the need to 
put this in writing.
[665.72] This is useless.
[667.28] Okay man, I am sorry.
[669.36] Forgive me.
[670.60] Okay, do one thing,
[672.56] here keep this cheque 
of two hundred thousand,
[673.88] shop for what you want.
[679.32] This is less.
[680.56] Hey, so you will get more.
[683.36] Idrees, I am not talking 
about the money.
[686.80] I don’t want to keep 
our wedding a secret now.
[691.56] Arooj taught you this 
lesson, right?
[693.96] First you promise me, 
you will stay away from her.
[696.68] And no one should find 
out this new address,
[698.80] your number should 
also be new.
[700.48] In return, I promise you,
[702.08] that once I get  my hands
 on this business and properties,
[705.40] after that, I will get rid of Shaista,
[707.12] it will just be you and me.
[708.52] Yes.
[713.80] Is Idrees fooling me once again?
[727.28] If this happens this time, 
then remember, Idrees,
[741.04] I am the one who made
 your life heaven,
[752.36] I will be the one who 
will make it hell too.
[764.60] I will make sure I snatch the 
interpretation of all my dreams from you.
[776.96] Now I will not make any
 compromise in my life.
[795.88] I think she has gone to sleep.
[798.80] That’s how it is.
[800.20] The child finds peace
 coming to their mother.
[806.12] Wasai, where is mama?
[809.36] She went to make Areej’s feeder.
[812.76] She was saying
[813.60] I will make it with my own hands.
[818.72] Arooj…
[819.44] Lower your voice,
[820.24] she is sleeping.
[821.68] Arooj, where are you?
[822.76] I have been searching 
for you for so long.
[824.84] Yes, you go ahead.
 I am coming.
[827.28] No, you come with me.
[828.32] Hey, I am telling you, I will come.
[830.12] She will wake up right now.
[837.12] Okay fine, but I am waiting for you.
[850.04] What happened?
[852.60] What happened?
[856.60] Wasai,
[859.52] you go check on mama 
in the kitchen.
[861.84] Sure. I will go check on her.
[903.80] Arooj.
[906.68] Arooj, child,
[907.32] when did you come from dinner?
[908.56] You didn’t even tell me.
[911.24] Where can this girl be?
[993.92] I have put all my property,
[995.72] business, and this home
 in Areej’s name.
[1004.08] You put everything in 
Areej’s name?
[1008.00] Yes, Mehreen, child,
[1010.44] even if you give your life for 
your daughter, it is less.
[1014.12] Daughters are such beings.
[1016.28] and my Salman?
[1019.76] Don’t worry, Mehreen,
[1021.68] I will not be unjust to him either.
[1025.40] Okay sir,
[1026.12] me and Mr. Idrees are 
going to the site,
[1028.44] so we will leave now.
[1029.80] Fine, Mr. Hashim,
[1031.24] you go ahead, we are coming.
[1033.24] Okay sir, thank you.
[1036.00] Where are you going, son?
[1039.16] Today, we will lay the foundation 
of our new factory, Areej textile.
[1048.24] and my daughter too will go with us.
[1132.84] Arooj.
[1135.00] What happened?
[1137.56] You look worried.
[1139.60] No sister in law, actually,
[1141.32] I was looking for Arooj.
[1143.00] She must be with Salman.
[1150.00] I have told you so many times,
[1152.20] let them both spend time together.
[1155.80] Don’t you understand this?
[1158.44] Yes, sister in law,
[1160.04] you are right.
[1183.20] My Salman
[1185.72] came to me today before
 going to the office.
[1190.88] So, what can I do?
[1194.32] You did what you had to.
[1198.68] The hatred you had put in Salman’s
 mind against me and Arooj,
[1204.28] it is over now.
[1209.32] He has found out 
who truly loves him.
[1219.64] What is the matter 
sister in law, Shaista,
[1222.00] you are not saying anything.
[1227.00] Okay fine,
[1229.00] I will see Salman too.
[1231.32] You can see him.
[1233.64] You can surely see him
[1234.96] when my Salman is with me.
[1240.08] Do see him.
[1293.92] Where did the documents go?
[1296.48] I had kept them here.
[1372.60] Wasai...
[1374.52] Wasai...
[1426.72] What is the matter, mama?
[1427.68] Why are you so worried?
[1437.00] Speak up, what happened?
[1439.96] Arooj, have you gone mad?
[1441.92] j
[1447.52] What were you going to do?
[1450.68] I don’t understand anything.
[1452.12] What are you trying to say?
[1462.76] Look at it and also understand it.
[1477.76] Your signature is on two papers,
[1479.60] and on the third paper…
[1512.36] I give up all my property,
[1514.36] business and this home,
[1527.28] and I am putting all of this
[1530.64] in Idrees Ahmed’s name?
[1541.48] Meaning, in uncle’s name?
[1553.88] Okay.
[1565.20] So this was Salman’s love.
[1568.68] Hah,
[1570.40] so called fake love.
[1573.24] All this was going to be put 
in brother Idrees’ name.
[1581.52] This means, those two have
 also used our Salman in this.
[1586.00] He is not a child, mama.
[1588.44] He too was with them 
in this conspiracy.
[1599.44] Okay, no issues.
[1603.20] We will see how many 
more days he does...
[1606.28] ... this drama of his false 
love with you and me.
[1652.76] I made a big mistake.
[1655.68] I don’t know what will 
happen to me.
[1658.16] I made a big mistake.
[1660.12] Please, forgive me.
[1663.04] Okay come on, sit up.
[1665.16] You are going to the office,
[1666.40] your clothes will get ruined.
[1667.24] No, I will not sit up till 
you forgive me.
[1670.24] Salman,
[1671.56] come on, sit here first.
[1673.80] First tell me,
[1675.32] will you forgive me?
[1676.76] We will talk.
[1678.08] Come on, sit here.
[1690.32] Look Salman,
[1692.72] we will forget whatever happened.
[1698.80] But you promise something.
[1701.64] Yes, what promise?
[1703.84] I will accept it.
[1706.56] You won’t say anything to Arooj.
[1712.76] I would like it if you 
two live with love.
[1719.60] Arooj too wants this,
[1722.40] and now she has
[1724.04] become the mother of 
your daughter.
[1728.16] You are right.
[1731.20] I promise you,
[1734.16] I will not say anything to her.
[1735.44] She will forgive me, right?
[1753.32] Wasai. Wasai.
[1756.20] Yes, little master?
[1758.48] There was a file in my room, 
have you seen it?
[1762.96] No little master,
[1764.60] I have not seen it.
[1768.12] Okay fine, leave from here.
[1771.16] Sure.
[1775.32] What happened?
[1776.12] What are you looking for?
[1777.72] Arooj, the file that you were signing,
[1780.24] it was in my room. I cannot find it.
[1781.96] Yes, yes,
[1783.68] so what happened?
[1784.72] Where did the file go?
[1786.12] I had signed it.
[1788.76] Yes, but one paper was left.
[1792.44] So, come on, give it,
[1793.36] I will sign it right away.
[1795.28] How will you sign it?
[1796.32] If I find it, then you will sign it.
[1796.88] I have seen the entire home,
 it is nowhere.
[1799.40] Hey, so it is our own home,
[1800.84] it will be somewhere here, 
we will find it.
[1803.96] By the way,
[1805.72] I have not seen you
[1807.12] so restless for anything
 before today.
[1811.24] That was uncle Waqar’s dream,
[1819.56] that I had to fulfill.
[1828.40] I had planned everything,
[1829.88] what do I do now?
[1830.96] I will go and search for
 it downstairs again.
[1848.28] See, Arooj,
[1850.52] I had told you,
[1853.80] my Salman is really good at heart.
[1860.40] He has realised his mistake.
[1880.32] I am really sorry, Arooj.
[1884.24] It is my fault. I admit it.
[1891.72] I am really sorry.
[1893.00] I shouldn’t have done all this.
[1895.96] I admit my mistake,
[1897.60] if you want you can punish me.
[1898.84] What are you doing?
[1899.48] Hit me. It is my fault.
[1900.52] What are you doing?
[1907.24] Plan my foot.
[1912.56] I will never let this plan 
of yours be successful.
[1954.60] Shaista, sit down,
[1956.04] why are you tiring yourself?
[1957.28] Sit down.
[1991.64] Why have you come 
empty handed?
[2001.36] Where is the file?
[2012.40] Salman, I am asking you.
[2015.04] What happened?
[2021.04] Did Arooj refuse to sign it?
[2024.60] She is really cunning,
[2025.88] she must have read that
[2026.72] everything will get 
out of her hands…
[2027.68] It is not that, dad.
[2035.48] She was trusting me 
completely, but
[2037.28] Wasai came at the
 last moment
[2038.88] and took her.
[2041.08] Everything was left incomplete.
[2044.76] So? So, now?
[2052.96] That Arooj has really good luck.
[2055.36] Now I cannot find that file.
