This mask of deceit and fraud 
that you people had on your face it has been removed. 
Enough! Stop your nonsense. You are calling us cheaters? There is no need to argue, Arooj. You leave from this home, 
don’t blow this out of proportions. You have blown it 
out of proportions. Now the matter will end. I am ending this matter. Hah, you had the right to 
start the matter, but not to end it. I will end it! Look, child, 
how she is misbehaving… Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future. Look here. 
Salman. Salman. Do you have no manners 
to talk? I will drag you out…
Salman. Salman, no. Leave me, papa. 
No. Why are you stopping him? What will you do with me?
Huh? Why did you stop? What do you think? I will get scared of 
this action of yours? No, elder madam, you are not well. 
You come with me. I am not afraid of anyone. All of you hear me carefully. Stop your nonsense. I will throw you out of this home 
right now. This is me and my mother’s home. No one can drag us out of here. Do you people understand? Hear me out clearly. This is me and my mother’s home. Leave me, we will see how 
you people don’t go from here. Salman, leave it. Why are you thinking this? And why are you afraid
of these people? No, I am not afraid. I just don’t want to live here. I don’t want any form of chaos. Mama, this is our home, we own all this and this is 
what these people want. I don’t want anything, Arooj. You are with me and
this is enough for me. Trust me, I am with you, but these people cannot do
anything to us. Fine, then, when you are with me, 
everything is fine. I just don’t want to live 
with these people. Listen to me. Look, child, you should listen to 
what your mother says. You don’t upset a mother. How can I upset you, mama? I am just trying to make 
you understand, these people cannot 
do anything to us. Arooj, don’t insist, child. For my sake. As you wish. Son, I am telling you, this girl will not go from here 
so easily. How will she not go? Papa stopped me, or else you people would have 
seen what I would have done to her. It is better to scare, 
then hit someone, Salman. You people don’t know, Arooj. She is not that weak. You shouldn’t have stopped me. Child, what has happened, 
forget about it. Now, think what do 
we have to do next. There is no need to think 
about that. They will have to leave this home. We are leaving. But don’t think that we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people. Mama… But I... will come back. I will surely come. This is my promise to all of you. Shall we go, mama? Why are you crying now? We left the home on your insistence. I am really disappointed the way we left this home. I spent such a long time over there. I saw so many seasons of happiness 
and sorrow there. We had to leave my Waqar’s home 
like strangers. How is our sorrow, mama? Is your husband’s house
the same as mine. That is not Salman’s house. Right now, he is living there. Very soon, everything will get better. It is impossible. When I can find you,
after twenty-five years. When this is possible, then anything is possible. I can understand your sorrow. I have stayed in that house 
for a little while. But you have spent a time there. You got married and 
came to that house. You saw a lot in that house. I never wanted that 
you leave that house. But I gave up in front 
of your insistence. I got scared. I was fearful. I had to do all this because of you,
because of Areej. Mama, look here. What happened? Did someone say something? Tell me. What happened? These people are saying, that we leave from this home. Who is saying all this? Sister-in-law, Shaista. Who is she? Who is she to drag us 
out of our home? I don’t know what she thinks 
of herself. I will teach her a lesson today. You live in such a big home 
yourself, with your wife and son, 
that too happily. Hey, tell me, do you want to go 
and live in that home? Really? Is this possible? Hey, is it possible? My wife, this is going to happen, 
it is just matter of a few days. I don’t understand anything. Hey, I told you, I am coming 
after meeting the lawyer. Shaista and Salman think that
I made the papers in Salman’s name. Then? No one will find out, as soon as Arooj signs, 
everything will be in my name. That’s it, then I will leave Shaista. I have had enough of her. 
She has grown old. I know that and after all, I am in your life. Yes, that is true. Hey, I have to reach the office. I have to make sure Salman doesn’t 
talk to the lawyer directly at any cost or else the secret will be out. Wasai. Yes, madam. Come here. Come near me. Go and tell the guard outside, that madam has ordered that those two shouldn’t 
step in this home. Okay? Wasai, did you not understand me? Yes. Then go tell him. Go. You are really happy. Why should I not be happy? The thorn has been removed. And the thorn that was pinching me
 in my heart. I have now found peace. Your plan is successful. Thank God it got successful. Or else, I felt that the entire chess game will be turned. It did turn, but in our Favor. Yes. Now, the four of us will rule 
this entire wealth together. Four? Meaning you are including Arooj? Not Arooj. Areej. Our granddaughter. Our Salman’s daughter. Excuse me. Hey, they are some 
twenty-five-year-old papers. How long do you have them for? For twenty-five years. When Waqar had put everything 
in Areej’s name, that’s the day I took out this file 
from the cupboard. You plan for the future, Shaista. You knew we would need them 
one day. I had kept all this safe. If you were there, we would have been 
living in a cottage instead of this home. No, that is not true. What do we have to do about these? You have to give these papers 
to the lawyer. He will redo them. I have spoken to Salman, he will coax Arooj and 
get her to sign it, and also give her thumb impression. You made a great plan. 
I will talk to the lawyer today. You have to do it today. You know about Salman’s mood; it can change at any time. If he gets angry at something in future,
then everything will be ruined. Got it? You are a liar. Not just a liar, in fact, you can fake love too. Arooj. Lower your voice. You faked your love to me; you made a fake apology to mama and now, you will give your life 
for your daughter? I am sure you are lying about this. What did you think? Did you think I will not 
find out anything? I have read all those papers Salman. What will you do, huh? What will you do with this wealth? Is all this more precious 
than selfless love? God be kind, what is the sound of that breaking? Look, child, how she is misbehaving… Be careful when talking 
to my mother in future. Look here. 
Salman. Salman. Do you have no manners to talk? I will drag you out…
Salman. Salman, no. Leave me, papa. 
No. Why are you stopping him? What will you do with me?
Huh? Why did you stop? 
What do you think? I will get scared of this action 
of yours? I am not afraid of anyone. All of you hear me carefully. Stop your nonsense. I will throw you out of 
this home right now. This is me and my mother’s home. No one can drag us out of here. Do you people understand?
Hear me out clearly. This is me and my mother’s home. We are leaving. But don’t think that we are leaving out of 
the fear of you people. Mama… But I... will come back. I will surely come. This is my promise to all of you. Wasai. Wasai. This woman doesn’t listen. Yes, madam. What is breaking upstairs? Little master, broke his picture with younger madam. Fine, leave. My Salman, came to me before going 
to the office today. So, what can I do? You did what you had to do. The hatred you had put in Salman’s 
mind towards me and Arooj, it has ended now. He has found out, who actually loves him. What is the matter sister-in-law, 
Shaista? You are not saying anything. Okay fine, I will see Salman as well. You can see him. You should surely see him, when 
my Salman will be with me. Surely see him. Aunt, I just got a question in my mind, why do you get so uncomfortable 
seeing Salman and his mother’s love? Now see, that’s how the love of a mother 
and son is like. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. But what would you know? You have no child of your own. I feel you want to say something. Good. This means that Salman wants 
to get rid of everything attached to Arooj. Then fine, if he wants this, then, I will surely help him.
