[24.68] Arooj is in this condition 
because of you.
[29.04] Be quiet, right now.
[31.76] At least tell me.
[42.00] What will you do finding out?
[45.80] What had to happen, 
has happened.
[55.24] Arooj was coming down 
from the stairs,
[57.72] it was dark.
[59.40] Her foot slipped and she fell. 
That’s it.
[63.76] This story is not as easy as 
you told this.
[71.80] Your doubt is absolutely right.
[81.04] Let me get successful once.
[84.40] Let me get rid of this Arooj once.
[87.40] That’s it.
[88.64] But why are you in such a hurry?
[91.24] You made an attempt one or two days,
today, you tried again.
[93.36] Because Arooj has found out a lot.
[99.40] Before she tells Mehreen or
 Salman everything,
[103.80] I want to silence her voice forever
[109.28] or else we will not get anything.
[118.32] You are right.
[120.28] No one will find out, who did it, 
and what happened.
[123.48] Everyone will forget it 
considering it an accident.
[128.24] Exactly.
[134.92] Come on. 
Come.
[136.68] Come on.
[235.32] What is the matter? 
You are smiling a lot.
[239.04] The thing is such.
[240.48] When you hear it, 
you too will smile.
[242.88] Then tell me quickly,
[244.12] because it has been long that 
I have not laughed either.
[246.80] The thing is that we are going 
to Dubai for vacations.
[252.84] Really?
[253.84] Absolutely.
[257.88] So, finally…
[260.56] finally, I will get a chance to breath 
with you in open air.
[265.84] We will get a chance 
to spend time together.
[268.88] Do you know,
[271.28] we live together,
[273.52] but we never got moments
of freedom.
[276.12] But Salman,
I will tell one thing,
[278.40] whether it is Dubai 
or some other country,
[279.96] no business, please.
[281.96] Alright, promise.
[283.84] No business.
[292.76] Do you know Salman,
[296.12] this sea drives me mad.
[300.36] Really?
[302.12] That is a really wrong thing.
[304.96] If such a beautiful wife of mine
goes mad,
[308.96] then what will happen to me?
[310.48] Salman. 
Just kidding.
[391.76] Salman, son,
[393.64] how did all this happen?
 Where is my Arooj?
[397.88] In the operation theatre.
[400.28] Don’t worry, Naseema, 
it will all be fine.
[403.96] Your Arooj is really courageous.
[413.64] Constant hits even break a stone,
 master.
[425.72] My Arooj is like a flower.
[435.72] God will make it fine. Sit.
[438.80] Sister Shaista, 
how is Arooj?
[442.52] Whatever God wills, 
what we can we do?
[447.52] We can pray.
[449.16] Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Sit, 
we will pray for her.
[471.48] Yes, sir.
[473.76] Yes, sir.
[475.04] Yes, I had come to the hospital.
Actually…
[646.92] Can someone be this cruel?
[660.00] Madam who used to encourage 
younger madam
[671.08] is praying for her to die.
[687.64] She is such a strange woman,
[693.80] she is thinking of cruelty 
against her daughter in law.
[712.08] Wealth makes a person blind
[720.92] that they are unable 
to see any relation.
[737.08] Younger madam’s sorrow is big,
[748.92] in fact, it was big,
[754.04] now it is your turn.
[760.28] God is the King of kings.
[841.52] Yes, doctor, is everything fine?
[844.64] God will make it all fine.
[846.40] There are some complications 
in the delivery.
[849.08] Complications?
[850.80] What complications?
[853.36] Problems? 
What problems?
[855.48] The way in which Arooj fell, 
the baby is fine
[858.52] and that is no less than a miracle.
[867.36] But the problem is related 
to the mother,
[869.44] pray and Mr. Salman,
[871.84] please sign this.
[877.44] We will try our best to save the life
of both mother and child.
[883.40] Yes, but…
[887.68] you just said that the child 
is absolutely fine.
[891.08] Look child, the life of the child is 
connected to the mother’s health.
[894.92] God forbid if something happens 
to the mother,
[897.04] the child’s health is also in danger.
[907.76] This way, we will only be able 
to save one person.
[915.60] Obviously,
[917.16] you will save the child, right?
[928.08] The child’s life is important.
[930.08] He is the child of our Salman.
[932.96] Aunt, what is wrong with you? 
What are you saying?
[943.72] Mr. Salman,
[946.36] you think about it. 
Discuss it.
[956.36] Sign this.
[962.56] But see, you don’t have a lot of time.
[965.88] Sure.
[967.36] Staff, when he signs this, 
inform me.
[969.72] You people come with me.
[971.68] Salman, son, listen to me. 
Come here. Come here.
[975.04] See.
[976.40] You will get other wives too,
[979.20] but this child is your blood,
[981.76] your future generation.
[985.40] What are you saying, aunt?
[991.00] Arooj is fighting between life 
and death there.
[994.36] She loves me so much and 
you want that I tell the doctor
[997.40] to save the child and let her die?
[1002.60] I think about the child 
who has not come in the world
[1005.16] and the one I have lived 
so much time with,
[1007.64] I should leave them. 
I should let them die.
[1009.96] No, Salman…
[1010.96] Salman is right, 
sister in law, Shaista.
[1025.80] If Arooj is important for Salman,
[1028.76] then Arooj’s life is important for us.
[1052.28] Don’t worry,
[1053.80] nothing will happen to Arooj.
[1069.72] Sign it.
[1156.32] It is such a torture,
[1158.40] what sort of a life is this?
[1165.36] There is not a single moment 
where I can find peace.
[1172.76] It is something disappointing for me,
[1178.12] that you don’t get peace with me here.
[1180.84] No Salman,
[1182.96] I didn’t say that.
[1187.72] I have no complaints from you.
[1191.00] You are the only one my own
[1197.32] and do you know
[1199.68] when I talk to you I forget 
all my sorrows, all my pain.
[1206.64] Don’t even think that.
[1227.60] Whenever I thought,
[1231.24] you always proved what I thought 
to be wrong.
[1237.56] Stop it, man.
[1239.80] Now I feel embarrassed 
what sort of a man am I.
[1242.60] No, there is nothing like that.
[1246.84] But,
[1249.08] do you know,
[1252.96] earlier, I used to think that
[1256.96] you are not a good man.
[1261.36] But then you also proved that wrong.
[1267.04] So, then when you felt 
I am a very good man,
[1270.48] what happened, then?
[1272.08] Then I fell in love with you.
[1279.76] But,
[1281.72] I was really scared hearing 
about your accident.
[1286.36] I was afraid that something 
would happen to you.
[1340.48] Madam Naseema, drink water.
[1346.28] Drink it.
[1347.60] God will make it all fine.
[1424.32] Wasai,
[1427.04] Arooj has always praised you.
[1431.84] You have been her well-wisher 
in her bad days.
[1441.76] Younger madam is really 
good herself.
[1449.08] Why did Arooj come down 
the stairs in this health?
[1456.36] Why did she come downstairs?
[1458.68] Were you not present there 
at that time?
[1466.00] Now what do I tell you?
[1496.40] Salman, son,
[1498.52] what did the doctor say?
[1502.68] The doctor has given us hope.
[1512.32] Nothing will happen to Arooj.
[1515.52] May God accept your prayers.
[1525.76] Child,
[1528.28] my Arooj is my life.
[1533.60] Arooj.
[1536.96] She is everyone’s life.
[1549.28] Don’t worry, everything will be fine.
[1578.08] Wasai,
[1580.56] what were you saying?
[1586.20] Nothing.
[1618.76] Mehreen,
[1622.40] what are you doing?
[1624.32] You have got such a good opportunity
to take out Arooj from Salman’s life,
[1629.68] and you made the decision 
in Arooj’s favour?
[1635.28] I didn’t make the decision 
in Arooj’s favour,
[1637.36] I made it in Salman’s favour, 
sister in law, Shaista.
[1641.32] I have no interest in Arooj,
[1643.72] apart from the fact that
[1645.80] Salman truly loves her a lot
[1651.52] and the one who is important 
for Salman,
[1654.68] they are also really important for me.
[1658.04] Did you not get this thought
a little too late?
[1666.80] Till yesterday, you didn’t like 
Arooj at all.
[1669.72] And today,
[1671.52] you like Salman’s choice.
[1676.24] Till now,
[1678.08] you too used to take her side a lot, 
sister in law, Shaista.
[1681.52] Now what new flaw has come 
in front of you that
[1685.08] only you know,
[1687.20] and you are hiding it from me.
[1689.04] No Mehreen, I was saying it 
because of you…
[1691.68] No, sister in law, Shaista, 
not because of me.
[1698.56] Anyway,
[1700.72] don’t tell me,
[1703.04] I will find out.
[1730.96] Now will you dance all night long?
[1734.36] Hey, it is a night of celebration tonight,
[1737.28] so I cannot control my emotions.
[1740.96] Control your emotions.
[1746.32] Shaista, what is wrong?
[1748.72] Let her celebrate. 
You know,
[1752.00] happiness has come to Waqar 
and Mehreen after six years.
[1757.68] Mama, I was just saying it is so late,
[1763.08] so we should start the ceremony.
[1766.16] Yes, you are right about that too.
[1768.52] Come on, Wasai, bring everything 
for the ceremony.
[1772.12] Mama, I have kept everything 
on the table already.
[1776.12] Okay children, come lets do 
the ceremony. Come on.
[1778.48] Come on.
[1787.56] Here you go, cold glass of juice.
[1789.28] Hey sister in law, Shaista, 
why did you bother?
[1792.20] You should have asked Wasai, 
she would have brought it.
[1794.20] Where is Wasai?
[1795.24] Wasai was busy in the kitchen.
[1798.84] I care about your health, 
so I brought it.
[1801.12] Stop Mehreen.
[1809.28] Take this.
[1811.84] You know what her condition is,
[1814.24] in such a situation she shouldn’t 
have anything cold.
[1821.08] Wasai.
[1822.72] Wasai.
[1823.60] Yes, mama, coming.
[1825.36] I don’t know where the hell she is.
[1827.84] Take this away.
[1830.64] Sure.
[1834.04] Mehreen, in future you will not eat 
or drink anything without asking me.
[1840.12] Do you understand?
[1847.04] Why should I tell you, Mehreen?
[1851.84] Why should I tell you?
[1857.56] She is the same girl
[1861.28] who took my Salman’s place 
in your arms.
[1869.68] This Arooj is Areej
[1878.48] and now she has come to drag us
all out of here.
[1888.24] Aunt. 
Yes?
[1892.56] What is the matter?
[1894.52] What are you thinking 
standing here alone?
[1899.32] Prayer.
[1904.00] I am making a prayer for Arooj, child.
[1915.76] She is such a good girl,
[1917.36] God knows whose evil eye affected her.
[1932.72] Don’t worry, everything will be fine.
[1937.68] Amen.
[1941.40] Amen.
[1983.24] Wasai.
[2012.20] Ouch. 
Ouch.
[2154.92] Your wife is really lucky.
[2157.64] I think a prayer of yours came
 to help.
[2161.84] Arooj is now out of danger,
[2167.64] and congratulations to you,
[2169.28] God has given you a beautiful daughter.
[2205.96] Thank you so much doctor, 
can I meet Arooj?
[2209.60] Yes, we are shifting her to the room, 
then you can meet her.
[2213.68] Thank you.
[2215.68] Come on.
[2218.04] Mom, did you hear 
what the doctor said?
[2236.04] Arooj is absolutely fine,
[2239.16] and you have become a grandmother.
[2241.52] Yes.
[2243.76] Wasai.
[2244.64] Yes, elder madam.
[2246.76] Tell the driver to get lots of sweets.
[2249.88] My Salman had a daughter.
[2252.80] Yes, yes, I will just get it.
