Arooj. You are crying secretly? But you are not telling
 me the reason for crying. No, I am not crying. I know how to differentiate between 
crying faces and laughing faces. Maybe you wanted to 
say something else, say that. Hmm I don’t want to say anything, because there is no point 
in saying anything. For you, I am a mother in law for you, when do you consider 
me your mother. and the one who I considered 
my mother for so long, when is she my mother. Maybe I have no mother. What are you thinking? Nothing. Arooj, child, I know you well. You are good girl who lives happily. But I have been noticing 
for the past few days, you have become really dull. I can feel your pain. Take care of yourself, and listen, stay happy. Yes. Aunt, I need your help. Yes, go ahead. What help do you want? I want to plan a surprise for Arooj? Really? Then I will surely help you. Tell me, what do I have to do? So, the idea is… I don’t want to say anything, because there is no 
point in saying anything. For you I am a mother
 in law for you, when do you consider 
me your mother. You are good girl 
who lives happily. But I have been noticing for 
the past few days, you have become really dull. I can feel your pain. Take care of yourself, and listen, stay happy. This sudden love of aunt Mehreen 
is not without a reason. She wants to know, the reason for this condition of mine. This means I am unable to stop the storm 
inside me from coming outside and if this barrier breaks, aunt Mehreen and Salman will find out and everything will end on that day. Mama is right, this thing shouldn’t get revealed. Salman, where are you taking me? To such a place where your
 memory will come back. What has happened to you? What happened to my memory? Wait. Just wait and watch. Tadaa! Surprise. Surprise. Come here, hold this. Hold it. Just a second. Wait. Where did it go? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Arooj. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Many, many happy returns
 of the day, child. Happy birthday. Now feed me some cake. Arooj. What happened to Arooj, son? I don’t know. No matter what, this cannot be my birthday. Who knows the day of my birth? Who know where I was born? Who knows which day I was born? No. This is not my birthday. In fact, this is the day, when I was found. Go ahead, child, Arooj. I didn’t come to say anything today. I came to listen. Tell me the entire story from the start. I want to know the entire story. Child, you ask questions, we will answer it. Where did you people find me? Child, your mother and I had gone to meet a friend
 of mine on the highway. On our way back, we heard a child crying in the shrubs. We looked around, no one was there. Your father moved towards 
the shrubs. He found you there. He immediately picked you up and brought you to me. There were you crying badly. My heart exploded seeing you. I hugged you uncontrollably. After that? What happened then? Child, I lifted you in my arms and took you around in
 the entire area nearby, but no one recognized you. So you didn’t file a report
 with the police? I even went to the police station, but there was no report 
of a missing child there. Meaning, I had gotten lost and - no one filed a report for me. We felt that nature has given
 us a gift in your form. Will you tell me, exactly what point on the super
 highway did you find me? This is what the location says Yes, I too feel this is the police station. Yes. Shall we go and find out? Yes, come on. come on. I think this is it. Yes, shall we go? You surprise me. Now you have realized that you need to search
 for the child? But you must have something
 in your record. This incident took place 
near your police station. Yes, we will surely find something. Some application. Some report. Madam, forgive me. Earlier we used to write
 reports with our hands, these computers just came in. But now you have to help us. Please find a way. Madam, I don’t understand what I can do in this? . Madam Greetings. Greetings. Yes, Imran, what is their matter? Sir, some girl had gotten lost, they are inquiring about her. Sir, there was so much
 rain at that time, there was a flood, the entire police station 
was washed away, sir. We have no record. Yes, the SHO is right. But sir, you can help 
us with something. Look, this is such an old matter, it cannot be solved. God knows how many SHOs 
came during this time. Then there was a flood, there was rain, there was a lot of destruction. The entire record of the
 police station got wasted. It is really difficult. It is a matter of someone’s life. Hmmm. Fine, do one thing, you give an application. I will order a reinvestigation. Okay? Okay fine, thank you. Imran, take the application from them, and yes, do take the home address
 and contact number. Fine, you go with her, and get your application recorded. Thank you. Welcome. Akbar take the history of the
 case from them in detail. Imran, ask for all the record, bring all the registers. I want to check it, maybe we will find 
something from it. Okay, sir. Bring all the record 
of the police station, sir wants to check. Sir, tea or water? No, thank you. Shanzay I feel we will find the police 
record with difficulty. Arooj, it is difficult but 
not impossible. You always give me courage
 by saying this. Okay, lets do one thing, let’s go to the SP office, we will surely get some 
help from there. Yes, good idea. Come on. You know, Shanzay, my heart says my parents are present 
somewhere over here. You will see, one day they will find me and I will be found. But will they too be looking for me, the way I am looking for them. Yes, Arooj, obviously, 
that’s how it will be. Then why did they not find me for so long, or did they too got disappointed
 trying hard. But you will see, I will find my parents, I will not lose hope. The courage with which you
 are finding your parents, you will see, one day 
you will find them. You know, my papa always says, only that person wins who has the passion to win and I will surely win, because my passion is true. That’s like my brave girl. Shall we go? You? When did you come? It has been a long time. Where are you coming from? I… I went to do some work. To the police station? To file a report for a missing child? What do you have to do with
 a twenty five year old case? I am asking you something, 
who is that girl? Child, I wanted to give you an advice. Don’t let your in-laws find 
out about all this. What if you have to face
 more difficulties. I didn’t ask you a difficult question, that you are thinking so hard. Arooj, I am asking you something. Answer me, who is that 
girl who is missing… My friend. She is my friend. A girl in her family got lost. So I thought I should also help in trying to find her. That’s what I am trying. There is something that is being hid from me. Oh wow, today my son got time to say 
good night to his mama. I remember well, when you used to wake up in 
your sleep in childhood, you would say goodnight again. Oh wow, you remember everything about me. If I don’t remember things about you, then I will die, Salman. Mom, you have started saying the
 same things again. I know. I know you become 
restless hearing these things. But I used to assure you that I will not go anywhere 
leaving my Salman. Mom, I came to ask you something. Yes, ask. Did you say something to Arooj? She is really dull. Did you see? You cleared my misunderstanding again. I thought my son came... ... to say goodnight to his mother, but no, you are worried for someone else. Go, I don’t want to talk to you. No mom, there is nothing like that. I came to talk to you. I was just saying that… Look Salman, I am just telling you for your comfort that I have not said anything to Arooj till now. Only because of you. Or else, since that girl has come to this home, she is creating difficulties for me in everything. What difficulties? This. Is this not enough that you are still talking about her right now. My son doesn’t have time to talk to his mother. Okay fine, I am sorry. I have made a mistake, I admit this. Take care of yourself. Goodnight. Goodnight. I am not going to get impressed 
by these tears of yours. I am not shedding these tears for you, I am shedding them for me. Another dialogue. I am well aware of the innocence... ... hiding behind this face of yours, Arooj. Then also teach me all this. How do you read someone’s face? Child, me and your mother had gone to meet a friend of 
mine on the highway. On our way back, we heard 
a child crying in the shrubs. We looked around, no one was there. Your father moved towards 
the shrubs. He found you there. He immediately picked you up and brought you to me. There were you crying badly. My heart exploded seeing you. Child, I lifted you in my arms and took you around in 
the entire area nearby, but no one recognized you. So you didn’t file a report 
with the police? I even went to the police station, but there was no report 
of a missing child there. We felt that nature has given 
us a gift in your form. Twenty five years? I was brought up in people who were ... ...never my own for twenty five years. I have been left alone. No, how can I think all this? If they were not my own, then, I too wasn’t their child. But they never let me feel this. Whatever it is I have to find my 
mother and father. I have to ask them once, that why did they separate 
me from themselves? If I had gotten lost, then why did they not search for me? What sort of a mother was she 
that didn’t even search for me. Aunty, you? It is a problem to look for you. Why were you looking for me? You are right. Why was I doing this useless thing?
