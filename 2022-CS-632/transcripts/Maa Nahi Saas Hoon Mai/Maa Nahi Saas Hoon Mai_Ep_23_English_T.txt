[41.16] Who is calling me?
[48.12] Naseema.
[51.20] Hello.
[52.12] Hello. Greetings sister Mehreen.
[55.64] How are you?
[56.96] Greetings, yes, I am fine.
[59.88] Arooj’s number is off.
[68.36] Is everything okay?
[70.76] Yes. She is absolutely fine.
 Why?
[75.36] No, no, nothing happened.
[77.60] Actually, her phone is not 
connecting since morning,
[80.64] if you can let me talk to her…
[87.32] Actually, she has gone to
 a function with her husband.
[92.52] Okay, then I will call 
on Salman’s number.
[97.40] Please don’t call him right now,
[99.60] it is possible he is driving.
[103.12] Okay fine.
[104.96] Even last time, my son had an 
accident because Arooj called her.
[110.80] Fine, sister Mehreen.
[112.20] I will not call him.
[113.92] But when those people
 come back,
[116.24] then will you let me talk to her?
[119.16] Yes, fine.
[120.32] I will let you talk to her.
[122.16] Goodbye.
[123.68] Goodbye.
[135.52] Arooj is not even there.
[139.04] Then where can she go?
[235.44] Do you know, Salman,
[237.36] these sarcastic waves,
[239.52] these blessed tides,
[242.08] how serene it is here?
[245.20] You are crazy, Arooj.
[249.44] You find peace in these sarcastic 
waves, and this noisy sea?
[257.36] Yes, maybe I am crazy.
[260.92] Because this madness of the sea,
[263.96] this noisy water,
[267.52] it calms down the storm inside me.
[274.04] And do you know?
[277.84] Whenever I want to talk to myself,
[284.00] then I come here.
[354.16] I am doing this for Salman,
 for aunt Mehreen’s happiness.
[363.64] I mean, it’s for them, not for me.
[366.60] I have to give them the 
happiness of a child,
[370.12] that you couldn’t give them.
[372.36] I just have to do it for them.
[433.56] You are amazing..
[440.20] Do you know how worried I was?
[442.44] Where did I not look for you?
[450.60] and I find peace here.
[455.00] What is the restlessness?
[460.32] Don’t you know?
[465.80] I am being made to share
 my husband,
[468.64] and you are asking me what 
is making me restless?
[486.28] Arooj,
[488.96] nothing like this will happen.
[492.24] At least not with me being here.
[497.32] and how long will you 
not want this for?
[502.48] Are you doubting me?
[506.20] It is becoming really difficult 
for me to trust this from you,
[509.68] in front of aunt’s insistence.
[512.88] What insistence?
[514.92] Can anyone be more 
stubborn than Salman?
[519.00] Trust me,
[521.16] nothing will happen.
[525.52] Aunty, has given that Alizeh 
so much confidence that
[528.24] she has started to taunt
 me in my own home,
[531.24] she misbehaves with me.
[535.84] She did this?
[538.76] Don’t worry,
[541.44] I will take care of her.
[543.60] What will you take care of?
[546.56] Aunty has announced the 
wedding on this weekend.
[549.76] Arooj,
[551.88] mama keeps on saying these things.
[555.40] I am the one who has 
to get married, right?
[559.84] I will say no.
[570.88] Will you say no to aunt?
[575.60] I will clearly refuse.
[583.64] Okay, come on get up, let’s go home.
[588.56] Arooj, come on, get up.
[595.44] Come on.
[651.96] Arooj, you consider me your enemy.
[662.92] You also insult me.
[667.24] Since you left home, I wish 
you never come back,
[677.04] and even if you come
 back stubbornly,
[680.84] then I will not leave any 
path for you to come back.
[700.32] I feel that I will have to 
use this tablet now.
[706.36] Because aunt Mehreen didn’t 
decide in my favour.
[712.72] Now I don’t see my plan getting
 successful without these tablets.
[741.00] So, this is the first tablet.
[785.44] Who are you making 
coffee for, Wasai?
[787.84] For younger madam.
[793.20] For Arooj?
[795.20] Yes.
[799.48] Wasai,
[802.44] actually, I was thinking
[804.60] if I make this coffee and
[807.32] give it to Arooj with my own hands,
[809.64] she will really like it, right?
[811.48] No. No.
[812.48] Why do you bother?
[813.96] Hey,
[815.36] if I give it, then
[817.96] maybe we will become friends.
[823.88] You go and do the other work,
[827.60] I will give her the coffee.
[829.40] Okay, as you like it.
[832.56] Go.
[882.44] Yes?
[887.56] I brought coffee for you.
[892.60] I saw Wasai making it,
[895.88] so I thought I would take it.
[898.76] Maybe you would think good of me.
[903.20] I cannot think bad for you,
[906.84] and you have not left me 
capable to think good.
[912.12] That’s true. My bad.
[919.24] Have the coffee at least.
[922.00] I don’t want to have it.
[933.08] I have really disturbed you.
[937.00] and maybe you are even 
disturbing me right now.
[944.00] Are you upset with me?
[952.16] Arooj, I never intended to come
[956.60] and interfere between you and Salman.
[966.12] Whatever I am doing is for aunt.
[969.04] Because she wants this, 
I am only helpless, Arooj.
[977.12] You are not a child,
[979.56] that you followed Mehreen aunty’s 
direction in whatever she said.
[987.36] I will not be fooled by these 
useless things you are saying.
[998.88] My tears,
[1001.24] what I say, it all seems like a lie,
[1003.04] an attempt to fool you, right?
[1010.80] It will feel that way, of course.
[1014.16] But I can explain you this, Arooj,
[1022.24] I lost my mother when 
I was really young.
[1029.96] After that, I have considered 
Salman’s mother my mother,
[1033.88] I have given her the position.
[1037.80] That is why I am doing 
what she tells me to,
[1040.48] so that she stays happy.
[1047.56] Only this is my fault.
[1055.56] Anyway, but still if you want,
[1058.88] I can take my flight back.
[1060.76] I can go back. I have no problem.
[1080.84] Fine.
[1085.32] You can leave.
[1094.24] Friends?
[1116.00] Please try it.
[1120.56] How is it?
[1147.04] The coffee is good.
[1151.04] Okay, I will go. 
Enjoy your coffee.
[1211.20] You got the wedding 
cards printed yourself and
[1213.60] asked the company manager 
to distribute it too.
[1215.96] So,
[1217.16] that’s how weddings are done,
[1219.12] you have to invite people.
[1221.40] Yes, fine,
[1222.96] then don’t invite me in 
this happiness of yours.
[1226.48] It is your wedding,
[1227.88] then why won’t you be there?
[1229.40] Because despite me telling you 
a thousand times not to,
[1231.88] you are still insisting.
[1233.32] I don’t want to marry Alizeh.
[1235.20] I think that Arooj has 
driven you mad.
[1240.04] Mama, see,
[1242.32] why don’t you understand?
[1244.56] Alizeh has trapped you.
[1251.36] She can be my friend, but 
marrying her is not possible.
[1260.08] I am really happy
 with Arooj in my life.
[1267.40] You want to get
 Alizeh married, right?
[1269.24] Then get her married.
[1270.56] With whom?
[1272.24] Marry her to anyone,
[1273.80] so that your stubbornness 
is complete.
[1275.32] I want her to marry you.
[1278.08] But I cannot marry her.
[1280.40] If not Alizeh, you will 
marry someone else.
[1283.36] You have to get married
 again at all cost.
[1285.68] I will not marry anyone.
[1292.44] Mama, why don’t you understand,
[1295.32] I love Arooj a lot.
[1297.80] I cannot live without her.
[1299.48] But I don’t like Arooj.
[1396.56] Look, Salman, I love you a lot.
[1400.28] But I don’t like Arooj at all,
[1402.44] I only accepted her because of you.
[1405.36] Look mama,
[1407.04] Arooj has nothing bad that you 
accepted her out of helplessness.
[1410.80] She has a lot that is bad.
[1412.44] She is not as per our standards.
[1416.12] Now Arooj is my wife.
[1419.40] Whatever my standard is
 her standard.
[1421.72] Fine,
[1423.08] I accept what you are saying,
[1424.76] still, now her not being able 
to become a mother.
[1427.64] Is it possible that
[1428.92] my only son remains childless?
[1431.80] Despite this, I still love her.
[1446.72] Can you not accept Alizeh
 because of your mother?
[1451.68] Accept?
[1454.88] I am not even ready to think this,
[1459.56] and please, mama,
[1461.28] don’t discuss this topic
 with me in future.
[1464.92] And what about the circle
[1467.44] I have given your wedding 
invitation to?
[1470.76] Say no.
[1472.76] What will I say?
[1474.00] Say anything, I don’t care.
[1476.24] But I cannot ruin my and Arooj’s 
life because of a few people.
[1488.40] Salman. Salman!
[1501.60] Arooj.
[1515.48] Brother Idrees,
[1516.60] now you make
 Salman understand.
[1518.72] What do I make him 
understand, Mehreen?
[1521.04] You see yourself,
[1522.44] all the arrangements for the 
wedding has been made,
[1524.60] the cards have been
 distributed
[1526.20] and that boy is saying no.
[1529.36] When did he say, yes?
[1531.48] This means you too are 
calling his decision, right?
[1534.04] I am not saying this, but…
[1535.48] But what?
[1536.60] You tell me,
[1537.60] will Salman go against his mother?
[1539.84] The issue is Mehreen,
[1541.40] Salman’s will is also necessary.
[1544.08] and mine?
[1546.24] it is nothing ordinary
[1547.80] and Mehreen have you thought
[1549.40] what Arooj thinks of 
this entire situation.
[1553.68] I don’t consider it 
important to think this.
[1555.60] So, you are forcing Salman in such 
an important decision of his life?
[1561.32] You mean to say,
[1563.16] you will not support me 
in convincing Salman?
[1569.00] I will try.
[1622.32] Do you see, Mehreen?
[1624.96] Yes, I have been seeing her 
for twenty-two years.
[1627.24] that woman is intolerable for me.
[1632.48] She has even gotten Salman’s
 wedding cards printed.
[1636.24] Yes, the printer’s payment 
went from the office.
[1639.92] What do you mean? You knew?
[1642.28] Then why did you not stop her?
[1644.44] Why would I stop her?
[1645.40] She is Salman’s mother.
[1647.96] Idrees, she got a five-star 
hotel booked.
[1654.16] And also, a room in it for 
the groom and bride.
[1659.44] They will stay there for two days
[1662.92] Yes, she is doing all things herself.
[1664.84] I don’t know who all she invited.
[1666.24] Just Salman is not agreeing.
[1670.08] You will see, this mad woman
[1672.56] will remain standing 
there with the bride.
[1678.72] It is such an important issue,
[1679.80] and you are not saying anything.
[1682.80] It is possible there won’t
 be a need for it.
[1686.64] I will go,
[1687.64] I am getting late for the office.
[1696.84] No one is helping me.
[1702.12] I will have to do something myself.
[1734.80] What are you doing here
 in my room? Huh?
[1738.24] I was cleaning up,
[1740.40] so I found this medication.
[1742.12] I thought I would keep 
it in the drawer.
[1744.84] How many times have told you not 
to get into my things like this.
[1748.32] I have told you, right? Huh?
[1750.36] Don’t you understand.
[1751.92] Go from here.
[1752.96] Go, do your work.
[1754.48] Okay.
[1804.84] Sit, uncle.
[1806.44] No, I am fine, son.
[1814.04] Son, I am aware of the
 entire situation,
[1816.84] still I came to talk to you.
[1821.40] Yes, go ahead. I am listening.
[1829.00] Your mama is really stubborn.
[1832.12] She has forced me to talk to you.
[1837.80] It must be the same thing,
[1839.20] marry Alizeh.
[1841.44] Although all of you know 
what my answer is.
[1844.20] Your and my answer is the same.
[1846.32] We all think the same
way about this issue, but
[1849.00] it is impossible to make
 your mother understand.
[1852.20] Fine, then,
[1854.12] if it impossible to make 
mama understand,
[1856.00] then me agreeing
 is also impossible.
[1860.04] I wish Waqar was here today,
[1862.36] he would have sorted this issue.
[1865.20] At least he would have made
 Mehreen understand.
[1867.88] Because I don’t know 
what I should do.
[1870.80] Uncle, when 
I have made my decision,
[1872.96] then discussing this again 
and again is useless.
[1876.16] Son, the wedding cards 
have been distributed.
[1878.28] We have a name in the city.
[1880.08] If this wedding gets cancelled 
then people will laugh at us.
[1884.04] So, should I give 
myself a lifelong trouble
[1886.08] out of the fear of people 
laughing at us?
[1888.88] People will also be 
surprised that
[1891.20] Salman is getting 
married in eight months.
[1894.64] They can be surprised 
if they have to,
[1897.20] but I will not do i
njustice with Arooj.
[1899.80] If we don’t find a solution for this,
[1901.56] then very soon that day will come
[1902.88] when all of this has to happen.
[1905.56] What will happen then?
[1907.44] that’s not something for 
me to think about.
[1910.12] Mama has made the decision,
[1911.68] she will answer everyone.
[1913.52] She has put me in a tough spot.
[1915.88] Now this wedding 
happening is a problem,
[1918.96] and it not happening 
is also a problem.
[1947.12] Arooj, nothing like
 this will happen.
[1953.12] At least not with 
me being here.
[1958.40] and how long will you 
not want this for?
[1963.40] Are you doubting me?
[1967.20] It is becoming really
 difficult for me to
[1969.80] trust this from you, in front 
of aunt’s insistence.
[2023.96] Wasai, keep the dresses here.
[2038.44] What is all this?
[2043.92] What is there to be 
so surprised in this, Arooj?
[2047.16] These are a few dresses,
[2051.52] select a dress for yourself,
[2054.24] that you will wear at the wedding.
[2060.76] Aliza is getting married
[2064.40] Why is all this for me?
[2067.64] I want that on the 
day of the wedding
[2069.00] both my Salman’s brides
[2070.72] sit on the stage together.
[2075.88] But why?
[2077.44] Because Salman thinks that
[2080.12] I am doing injustice with you.
[2087.80] In fact, everyone thinks this.
[2092.76] Meaning, you will make 
me a puppet
[2095.00] and sit in front of people.
[2103.48] You are doing injustice with me.
[2107.60] and this will be a matter 
of my respect.
[2114.08] Everyone will feel I am 
treating both of them equally.
[2122.20] It is not necessary
[2125.00] what you are thinking is right.
[2133.40] I will not be part of
 this drama at all.
[2137.08] Hmmm.
[2139.20] I didn’t come here 
to take your opinion,
[2142.36] this is my order.
[2145.72] Understand.
[2156.52] Wasai,
[2160.12] take these clothes.
[2162.80] But…
[2164.64] Take these dresses.
[2212.92] Salman
[2221.00] You had said that you
will not get married
[2228.24] and aunty even brought clothes.
[2235.68] Meaning, you kept me in the dark.
[2238.28] You didn’t tell me anything.
[2240.16] Let whatever is happening, happen.
[2245.64] But remember one thing,
[2249.76] this wedding will not take place.
[2257.24] It will not take place at any cost.
