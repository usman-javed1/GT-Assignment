So, it means you have called Salman. So, my child, why aren’t you telling us why Salman took you out of his home? And why didn’t you call us last night? Is that how someone stays outside
 the home all night? Okay so, she is here. She really likes to stay here and you guys really like making 
her stay here, she will live here from now on because I am leaving her forever 
and ever. Arooj, it’s not what you are thinking, believe me, you are the only girl 
in front of whom I am helpless. What is the reason of being helpless? I love you. I want to marry you. Will you marry me? I like your daughter. I am here with her proposal 
for marriage if you guys don’t have any objection. I have an objection, how dare you even say this? It looks like you are not 
in your senses, Mister. I am in my absolute senses and I know very well 
what I am saying. Salman, son, listen to one thing 
before saying anything. say what you want to say. Son, we have always respected 
your decisions and we will do the same today. Master, do you even know what decision are you talking 
about accepting? To be honest, Naseema, I am not scared of any decision 
that Salman might make now, yes, accepting Arooj was also 
Salman’s decision, in fact, he was adamant. Salman is unable to fulfill what he was 
adamant about at that time so why should we be scared of 
what he is being stubborn about now? Salman is not picking up the call, are you worried or not? There is no need for anyone to be 
worried, sister in law Shaista. this is nothing to be proud of, 
Mehreen, have you heard the word divorce
on our family ever? But Sadly, you guys are getting all this done. No one is getting anything done, 
sister in law Shaista, Salman is free to make his decision. Mehreen is right, Salman is intelligent. I don’t have any doubts on 
Salman’s intellect, my only concern is that he is being 
fooled in the name of love and hate. Are you pointing towards me,
 sister in law? please, please Mehreen, I don't want to get into any 
argument right now, right now I just know that if Salman takes any such step 
his entire life will change. Nothing will change, in fact, it will be like before, an arrogant girl like Arooj won’t be
in Salman’s life. No, I won’t let that happen. Salman, pick up the phone. Salman, son, it is good for a person to 
have authority, but responsibilities also increase 
when you get the authority. I know everything. Just knowing is not enough. it’s very straight, Uncle, Arooj was missing all night
 out of home, and I cannot even think of living 
my life with such a girl. Salman, don’t put any allegation on Arooj. Master, let me talk. Salman, you are the one who took 
Arooj out of the house, she didn’t leave the house 
by her own choice. Arooj is not such a type of girl, you must have known that by far. That is the problem, she doesn’t let me know 
anything about her. My child, you need to give confidence 
to your wife to know her. There is no use in saying 
all this now because Arooj has created a lot 
of distance between herself and I. And it is about my trust now. Had you contacted her friend Shanzey, you wouldn’t be saying this right now. Hello? Arooj, thank God you took my call, 
my child, Salman is not picking up my call. He is with Dad, he is here to tell his decision for 
the sake of comforting his ego. No, no, my child, 
Salman is not like that, it’s Mehreen who is feeding his brain
and heart with hatred. Aunt, Salman is not a kid that someone fed so much 
hatred in his mind that he has no place for me 
in his heart anymore. My child, try to understand that Mehreen is the one 
who controls Salman’s nerves, sometimes in the name of motherhood
and sometimes in sympathy. But I don’t need sympathy, Aunt. I just need Salman who can 
differentiate between right and wrong. You are absolutely correct, just have courage, in fact, make me talk to Salman, I will, I will make him 
understand myself. No Aunt, not at all, if Salman will create his opinion 
on someone’s words, then I don’t need that at all. Okay then, I will talk to Salman myself, but Arooj, my child, if you get a chance to reconcile, 
don’t refuse because the Arooj I know 
wants to reconcile, right? Okay, take care, I will talk to you later. You know how much I love you, right? And I won’t let anyone be 
a hindrance in my love. I won’t let anything happen. To cut everything short, whatever sort of complaint you have 
from Arooj, no matter if it is baseless but even if you are still adamant 
on your decision, none of us will stop you. Remember one thing, it’s not like our Arooj doesn’t have
 anyone on her back. We won’t leave her alone 
till our last breath. Uncle, actually, the thing is, Arooj stays out of home all day 
since the past few weeks. She stays up all night, keeps on thinking, visits police stations, gets in fights
 with someone or the other, and when I ask her, 
she doesn’t tell me anything, am I that unimportant? What is she looking for? Uncle, I am her life partner and I am the one unaware 
of everything, you tell me, if that how you live a married life? Where a wife hides things 
from her husband? I am tired. Business, mom, home, I need comfort from all of this, and Arooj is just increasing 
my discomfort. I don’t get it why Arooj doesn’t 
share her problems with me. I will remove this factor that 
is causing you discomfort. I will share one of Arooj’s issues 
with you, now let’s see if you support her
after that or not. What issue? Master? Arooj is looking for her parents. Yes, son. Arooj is not our biological daughter. What are you saying, Uncle? I am right. Arooj was a few months old 
when I and Naseema found her. Such a huge thing? You guys hid such a huge thing 
from me? You just got worried listening to this, though Arooj went through this problem. Just imagine the mental state Arooj is going through. Shall we go? where? Our home. I might be able to get rid of the pain 
caused by your dishonesty but the bruises on my soul 
will take time to heal. I am really sorry, dude, I don’t know what happens to me, and then everything gets ruined. This is my fault, I admit it. Are you embarrassed? The result of anything said out of anger
 is never good. For now, I want to stay here 
with my parents. But why? I need to find my parents, get lost in myself in that house so how will I find anyone else? So, I will help you in finding them, I am with you. I just need one help from you, whether I am missing or my parents, no one should get to know this, because if Aunt Mehreen finds it out, she will ruin my life or she will get another excuse
to get me divorced. Arooj, please trust me, next time, any excuse or reality won’t push me to make 
such a decision. You can stay here for as long as 
you want to, but whenever you think of me, just come back, I will wait for you. Take care of yourself. Arooj is not such a type of girl, you must have known that by far. That is the problem, she doesn’t let me know anything
about her. My child, you need to give confidence 
to your wife to know her. There is no use in saying all this now because Arooj has created a lot 
of distance between herself and I. And it is about my trust now. Had you contacted her friend Shanzey, you wouldn’t be saying this right now. I will share one of Arooj’s issues 
with you, now let’s see if you support her 
after that or not. Arooj is looking for her parents. Yes, son. Arooj is not our biological daughter. What are you saying, Uncle? I am right. Arooj was a few months old 
when I and Naseema found her. Such a huge thing? You guys hid such a huge thing 
from me? You just got worried listening to this, though Arooj went through 
this problem. Just imagine the mental state Arooj is going through. I loved Arooj, but I couldn’t fulfill that love yet, but this time I will prove 
my love for Arooj by helping her find her parents and by just supporting Arooj 
in front of Mom. Come, daughter, sit. What is it, daughter? Dad, forgive me. Apology for what? I have hurt both of you a lot, unintentionally I tried to take you 
off the position of parents, and you, both of you are still mine. My child, when did we become strangers? And how will we ever be? Parents are always your own. Do you guys know, both of you have given me the strength
to keep my head high in front of Salman. my child, we haven’t done 
anything extraordinary, parents never let down 
their children, one more thing, parents aren’t just who give birth, the parents who raise have 
very high ranks too. You continue trying, I pray that you find the mother 
who birthed you, we will be happy. And yes, one more thing, only the one who has hope to win, wins.
