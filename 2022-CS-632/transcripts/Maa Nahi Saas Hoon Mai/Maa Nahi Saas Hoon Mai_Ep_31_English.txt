Wasai? Wasai? Coming. Yes, Madam Jr, do you need something? Wasai, my mom is here, make a good cup of tea for her. Sure, sure, you go sit with her, I will bring the  tea. Okay. Listen, did you give tea to the staff? What happened? Actually, Madam Sr ask me to waste it. Waste it? But don’t worry, I will sneak out from
Madam Sr in a while. I guess, you couldn’t understand
me properly yet, Wasai. I am not habitual
of working secretly, when someone cannot differentiate
between white and black, right or wrong, what can we do then? But, Madam, what will you do now? Don’t worry Wasai, I will arrange for it myself. You were saying that this is an office. How are you sister Mehreen? This is an office, lower your tone, my staff works here. Not yours, Salman’s staff and if this is an office then why have you made an environment
like it is your parents’ house? Mom, have tea. No, I don’t feel like it. I apologize to you for
aunt Mehreen’s behavior. That’s how she is. No my child, you don’t have to apologize but bringing office to home is not something that she got so upset. If anything happens
against her will, she cannot bear it. She should bear it, people get patient by this age, they don’t act stubborn
like a baby. You are saying all this
because you are my mother. My child, are you comforting your
own self or me? I wish, doing all this comforts me. I am your mother, I just want you to
always be happy but sister Mehreen doesn’t seem to be
happy in any situation. When anything
gets into her mind, she wants to see
it accordingly. Arooj, you must reconsider
decision. My child, home is more important
than office. mom, I am doing all this for
this home and Salman. Do you know that since I have joined this office and looked after the
finance department, there is  corruption
worth millions here. Now its different that I don’t have any solid proof yet that I can disclose their names. Fraud? Who is doing it? Okay if you don’t want to tell, okay then I will leave you just stay happy. And mom, don’t discuss anything with dad. He will get worried if he listens, he will take tension
for no reason. it is not in fathers’
control that they can listen to
daughters’ problems. Nature has given this responsibility
as well to the mothers. Okay then I will leave. The email is here. whose? Madam asked me to fix meeting
with Stoneberry Marbles, their dates have been
confirmed. So then what could happen
in the meeting? Whatever is happening, company will come and tell
everything to Madam Arooj. Why is Arooj after me? You are very brave boss, you can go tell them where ever
the marble has been used. Haven’t you strated talking a lot? Sir shutting me won’t help, my share in this work is
only a handful anyway. That’s how it is, the bigger the position,
the bigger the share. Boss may I tell you something? I am just an employee, even if I get fired, I will get a job somewhere, boss you are the owner, you won’t get the possession. Let’s give 65 lacs to
stoneberry marbles. Company people will get shut and madam will fail too. 65 lacs is not a small amount so then what should we do boss? I will think of something, I will think. Miss Naseema, you? You are here? when did you come?
No one told me. How are you? I ma fine, I was just in Arooj’s office. Come let’s go sit inside. no, I am getting very late, just let me go now. How can I let you go like this? You are our son’s mother in law, it is my duty to be hospitable towards you, it is the tradition of this house. Come. Hey, no, thank you so much, it has been very late,
I will come some other time. No, I won’t listen to anything. Come, let’s sit in my room. Come. so then tell me, how is
your office going? My office? Our office. okay our office. Tell me how is your day going so far? Are you enjoying? hmm, it’s going well, you must also know that there is staff in this office and we need a tea and coffee
maker in this office too. So then ask Wasai, she will make it and send it for you. I guess you are forgetting
Aunt is here too. So what? She has restricted coffee
and tea for the office. Okay don’t worry, I will send a tea maker,
hmm? Okay thank you. Take care. hello? Yes Mr Imran, I am fine, yes we have fixed the meeting
for tomorrow morning. I will see you by God’s will,
thank you. The tea is here too. Madam, do you need something else? No, no, you may go. Okay. Whenever I see Arooj, I feel like saying one thing to you. What thing? You have raised Arooj very well. You have fulfilled the
responsibility of  a mother. Sister Shaista, it is your love that you see my Arooj that way. That’s how Arooj is, lovable. And you should keep
smiling that way too. You are right, those mothers are very lucky who leave their daughter’s in laws
house with a  smiling face. What did you start thinking? I am thinking you are so affectionate
towards Arooj, I wish my Arooj would have gotten
a  mother in law like you. I wish I could tell you that I am Arooj’s mother in law and Salman is my son only. Shaista, if you mind what I said untimely, I apologize for that. No, no, there is nothing like that, what you said untimely, I have heard that for the
first time in my life. You are not taking anything,
don’t be formal, have it. Wasai has made this
fruit salad herself. She cooks really well. Have it. Accounts Department? I need statement of
the last 6 months, quickly, thank you. What is this strange way that
the corruption has been done, it looks like the one who was doing it is not
scared of being caught at all. And what’s cruel is that the
audit has been done too which means a lot of
people are involved. It is surprising that how is such a big business
functioning like this? I am your mother, I just want you to always be happy but sister Mehreen doesn’t seem to be
happy in any situation. When anything gets into her mind, she wants to see it accordingly. Arooj, you must reconsider your decision. My child, home is more important than office. Madam Jr? what happened Wasai? I know why are you sad here. It is easy to bear your own pain but it is very difficult to bear
the pain of your loved ones. But I can help you feel better. Madam took your mom to the room and she served her pretty well, your mom left very happily from here. Really? yes. Where is aunt? In her room. Hey Arooj my child, where are you going in this speed? What happened my child?
Is everything all right? Thank you, Thank you,.
Thank you, thank you so much. For what? because you gave my
mom so much love and respect, so thank you for that. Are you mad? What have I done? I was just hospitable
to the guest at home and especially your mom, that is my duty. Okay now go, your staff must be
waiting at the office. Oh okay, okay I will be right back. What is all this? How do you guys work? Why is every paper incomplete? I need all the reports on my
table by tomorrow morning and Miss Amna, you will follow up on all this. You all may go now. Ma’am, I need 5 minutes from you. Sure, tell me? Come sit here. No, no, I will sit here. Okay. What is all this? I don’t understand anything, are these accounts or
a gamblers game? What do you mean? And you are saying that? I mean, you are being afraid of
addition and subtraction? Arooj I haven’t taken
a degree in crime, I am an accounts expert, I don’t understand
what is all this? But what has happened? Who is this Mr Idrees? He is Salman’s uncle. He looks after all the finance
of the head office. But why are you asking? Any amount without records, he sign those papers
and become a barrier and he is very influential. There are two types of
things that are influential, either good or bad. Now what are you talking about? Now he is the uncle of your husband, what can I say but I would just say that he is not affecting positively. I Know that and to end these affects, I would need your help. Don’t worry, I am your friend, and I will also take salary from
you for this work. Thanks. do you see? Do you see what is going on? Home has become office and
office has become home. And I am worried here and
you are being happy? Everything against
Mehreen makes me happy. Thank God that there is at least
someone so brave who can teach Mehreen a lesson. you just care about Mehreen and you are not concentrating
on what I am saying. I am concentrating and I always do, but you always shut me up. But Arooj, she always finds her way, that is why my vote  is with Arooj. Hey you don’t know what
the actual thing is. What is the actual thing? Tell me. what is the purpose of business? To earn money. Exactly, so that money is being
gradually captured, her own people, her own staff. Do you understand
what is going in? No, I don’t understand. Tell me is she doing good or bad? If she is doing good then why do you have
a problem? You should support her because all the business
belongs to our son Salman. You just be happy that your daughter in law is taking
the business to the new heights. You wouldn’t understand
what I am saying. You are right. If you were so smart, you would have had a separate
business of your own. Shaista is right though, but what is she saying she
has no proper idea about it. I have always considered
this business my own but now Arooj has made me
realize it is not my business, now it feels like that my honor is also at
stake along with the business. brother Idrees, you have started to remain
worried all the time. I am worried. Mehreen , you couldn’t stop Arooj. What can I do brother Idrees, Salman’s love hinders. I have to tolerate everything. Salman’s love? You are right, Salman’s love for Arooj
has beat everything, Salman, in Arooj’s heart… If Slaman loves anyone,
that is just his mother. you still think so? I don’t have to think, that’s how it is. I cannot stop her from
working from home now, what she has done
has left me speechless. Who can make you speechless? You are always… Brother Idrees, you know that I don’t talk without a logic. What is it , brother Idrees? What are you thinking? Nothing, nothing at all. I will leave now. What should I do about this Arooj? She has bothered everyone. Hello? Yes Salman? Arooj, send Ammad to my office. Is there any issue? Anything special? No there is no issue, and if there is any issue anyway, I am the MD of this company, you cannot question me. Hmm, you are right. I want to meet who you
have appointed for once. Okay I will send Ammad. Thank you. yes madam. Come to my room. Okay, coming. Yes, madam? Salman has called you. Umm, should I go right now? yes. Okay. What is there to be so
worried about? In fact, I don’t even know
why is he calling you? And look, please do not try to be over smart at all else our entire game will be ruined. ok We don’t have all the proofs
right now to disclose anything, we have to keep these corruption
details hidden from everyone. Don’t worry, I very well know what
to say when I get there and what needs to
be kept secret. Okay, just talk as much he asks you. May I go now? Arooj I haven’t taken
a degree in crime, I am an accounts expert, I don’t understand
what is all this? Who is this Mr Idrees? He is Salman’s uncle. He looks after all the finance
of the head office Any amount without records, he sign those papers
and become a barrier and he is very influential. There are two types of things
that are influential, either good or bad. Now what are you talking about? Now he is the uncle
of your husband, what can I say? Hello? Yes, send him in. Thank you. Come in. Greetings sir. Greetings, have a seat. Thank you. Welcome to our company. Thank you, sir. So tell me, how do you feel after
joining our company? Sir, everything is perfect. And your boss? Are you comfortable
with your boss? Sir, how wouldn’t
I be comfortable, I guess you don’t know
we were classmates. What a surprise. It has been 6 days since
you joined this company and I am finding this out today. Sir, she has always
liked giving surprises so I guess she wanted
to give you a surprise? yes, true that, I have heard that there have been some problems
going on in our accounts that is important for me to know. And that was the reason
that Arooj hired you for. Sir, we are working, as soon as we find
out anything that is important to bring
in your information, I will definitely tell you. Perfect, rest, if you have any problem
or need anything, so do let me know. Sure sir. You may leave now. Thank you sir. Why has Salman called Ammad? Salman is the owner,
he can call anyone, boss. No, it is not something minor, there is definitely something. Boss, I think you know everything that is why you are feeling
that way and you are worried. You are right but
we have to be careful. By the way, true that. Boss, it is a war between your cleverness
and Madam Arooj’s intelligence and intelligence always wins. I have asked you to talk less. what an interesting thing, I just need to manipulate Mehreen and she immediately wakes up and gives a result. Now what does Shaista know that whatever Mehreen is doing, I am the one who provoked her. This is an amazing chance, I will change the whole scenario
without coming on eye. I will change it. Hey when did you come? And so silently? I? Just came right now. You tell me, how was office? Very tough. Under the admin officer. Admin officer? Hmm, Aunt Mehreen. You are calling mom
and admin officer, by the way she is the owner. Absolutely, I know that too, but in this  possession, I and
Aunt would be 50-50 partners. Really? So now director of finance
will talk about 50-50? Not at all, I just said that as your wife. Anyway, tell me how
did you like Ammad? He is nice, he has the potential. He used to top in the university and then went to America so I didn’t stay in contact with him. Okay so now we will have to see how beneficial he is for our company. Trust me, we will only get benefit from him. Let’s see. You freshen up, I will get tea for you. I even have to give these
clothes to Wasai for ironing. All right. Idrees? You came back from the office
during the day, today? yes, I have come from
the office to the office. Okay, so yes, Arooj is there in the
office only with her staff. I know. If you want to have
something then tell me, I will arrange it because Mehreen has restricted
the kitchen being used for Arooj’s office. Yes, the one who will try to
shut the kitchen of others, their own kitchen
will be shut too. What do you mean?
Who are you talking about? Nothing, I will come eat after
I am done with the meeting.
