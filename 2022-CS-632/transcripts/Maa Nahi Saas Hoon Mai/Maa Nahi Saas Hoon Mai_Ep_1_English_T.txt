[128.80] Here you go, Wasai,
[130.36] distribute it amongst everyone.
[133.20] Yes, mama.
[152.20] Here you go.
[153.64] Today is a great day, Wasai.
[155.40] Yes, what else?
[156.56] Where you have bosses like elder sir,
 and elder madam,
[160.52] there every day is great.
[163.52] Here you go.
[164.68] Here, madam Mehreen and
 Mr. Waqar own everything.
[167.80] What do you mean?
[169.72] Mr. Idrees is just like that.
[171.68] Stop it. Stop it.
[172.88] You people just need a chance 
to bad mouth the bosses.
[178.20] Take it and go from here,
[180.08] do your duties.
[195.56] Salman, come here to mama.
[197.92] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[199.44] Come my child, my love.
[201.56] Hey son, get up from here.
[204.76] Now Mehreen will have her own child.
[208.84] No,
[209.60] I want to stay with mama.
[214.68] Absolutely,
[215.36] my Salman will stay with his mama.
[231.72] Shaista, what is the matter?
[233.16] What are you thinking?
[235.36] I am thinking what I am seeing.
[241.84] You too look that way.
[244.84] This is nothing new,
[246.08] our Salman is attached to 
Mehreen like this all the time.
[251.12] He won’t remain attached now.
[257.12] When Mehreen will have her own child,
[261.04] then our Salman will have no value,
[270.00] and your younger brother
[272.64] will put all his property
[274.88] and business in his child’s name.
[291.44] Did my son eat something?
[293.48] I don’t want to eat something.
[295.44] Why don’t you want to eat?
[297.00] Take out all the guests from here,
[299.04] we will go in our room.
[300.96] Okay, we will go just now.
[302.32] We will go in a little while.
[303.36] Mischievous.
[304.64] Son, Salman,
[306.52] come on, let’s go to our room.
[312.52] Sister-in-law…
[313.28] I said come to your room.
[318.88] What is wrong, sister-in-law Shaista?
[320.92] Why are you insisting?
[323.08] Salman is already in a bad mood.
[326.24] His mood will get fine,
[328.12] you don’t worry.
[331.84] Come on.
[332.52] What happened Shaista?
[334.92] See Idrees,
[338.12] Mehreen should be careful
 in this condition
[341.60] and Salman is jumping in her lap.
[350.44] Shaista,
[352.20] you know Salman doesn’t stay 
without Mehreen even for a moment.
[355.84] Leave his hand.
[359.00] Yes, mama.
[363.20] Come on. Come on. My son.
[392.84] Enough. Stop it. Stop it. 
Stop playing the drum.
[395.56] Elder madam is going to have
 a big happiness in her home.
[399.04] Come dance with me. Come on.
[402.52] Play the music.
[413.80] Wasai.
[421.04] Yes, madam?
[423.00] Now do you want to dance all night?
[425.88] Hey, tonight is a happy night,
[429.28] so I cannot control my emotions.
[433.04] keep your emotions under control.
[452.52] Shaista, what happened?
[454.88] Let her celebrate her happiness.
[456.88] You know,
[458.36] Waqar and Mehreen are getting
 happiness after six years.
[464.08] Mama, I was just saying it,
[468.08] because so much time has passed,
 let’s start the tradition.
[472.48] Yes, you are right about that.
[474.84] Wasai,
[475.96] come on bring everything
 for the tradition.
[478.36] Mama,
[479.32] I have already kept the 
things on the table.
[482.40] Okay. Come on, children, 
let’s do the tradition.
[484.72] Come on.
[546.52] Elder madam,
[548.48] come to the room with me.
[550.60] Rest a little. You must be tired.
[555.92] Wasai, you go right now,
[558.56] I will sit here for a while.
[561.04] I find peace here.
[563.48] Okay, as you wish.
[566.12] Call me when you want to go.
[569.08] Okay.
[582.84] Shaista, I don’t understand why you 
have adopted this behavior.
[587.00] You even created a mess in 
Mehreen’s baby shower.
[593.40] Did you not see
[595.32] how my Salman wanted 
Mehreen’s attention,
[599.68] and what did Mehreen do?
[601.88] She totally ignored Salman.
[604.40] There is nothing like that.
[606.36] Shaista, you asked him
 get off Mehreen’s lap,
[609.56] although she didn’t agree to it.
[611.36] Fine,
[612.84] I am taking it wrong. I am lying.
[615.52] I didn’t say anything like that.
[619.60] But, yes, I do want to know 
what you are thinking nowadays.
[624.28] My Salman was the only 
child of this family
[630.48] and now?
[632.28] Now even Mehreen will be a mother.
[635.24] What does this mean?
[637.96] It is something straightforward, Idrees.
[641.60] My Salman was the only 
heir of this home.
[646.64] Going forward
[648.00] he was to get this property, 
business, everything.
[652.20] Meaning, we would get it.
[657.96] But, will this happen now?
[659.92] That’s why I am saying this.
[662.28] Shaista, how can you
 think so negative?
[665.88] Earlier, there was
 nothing like this.
[668.04] Earlier, Salman was 
not ignored like this either.
[671.36] He was the star of everyone’s eyes.
[674.12] What difference does that make?
[675.32] It makes a difference,
[676.92] but not to you, I think.
[681.12] You are happy working as a
 GM in your brother’s office,
[685.96] so you stay happy.
[707.44] What are you thinking?
[710.00] I am thinking about 
God’s greatness.
[719.88] I was completely hopeless.
[726.76] But Mehreen,
[731.48] I have never felt you to be hopeless.
[738.00] No children and no hope 
for six years of marriage.
[748.56] A woman wishing to be a mother,
[751.08] gets disappointed.
[752.84] Okay,
[756.44] thank God now
[758.72] that He didn’t let your hope die.
[763.48] He listened to our prayers.
[768.20] When a woman has a child in her lap,
[772.08] then she considers 
herself to be complete.
[776.36] When did you let Salman get off your 
lap in these six years of not having a child?
[782.68] He is not this attached to his mother,
 sister-in-law Shaista.
[786.72] He cannot be either.
[789.96] I don’t know why,
[793.16] there is a weird attachment 
between me and Salman.
[798.16] There is a bond,
[800.04] and I am unable to understand
[801.04] what and why the strength of it is.
[808.04] Okay, you didn’t tell me,
[810.64] what should we name our future child.
[814.96] Good question,
[817.08] if it is a son, then I will name him,
[819.96] and if we have a daughter,
[821.28] then you can name her.
[823.44] Okay.
[829.16] But what happened in the 
function right now,
[834.12] I didn’t understand this behavior 
of sister-in-law Shahita.
[841.44] I admit, Salman is her son but…
[845.04] Salman is also my son.
[847.36] If you want, you can ask Salman.
[853.60] Yes, Salman is your son.
[876.36] Wasai, come here.
[879.56] Yes, madam.
[882.76] Mehreen is having a child
[885.60] and you are celebrating.
[886.96] Why?
[888.04] I get happy in every 
happiness of this home.
[891.24] That’s it,
[894.16] no need to talk a lot.
[896.96] You were dancing with 
a lot of enthusiasm.
[900.96] If I tell you to do the work at home,
[902.48] you have pain in your knees.
[904.84] I forgot all my pain in elder 
madam’s happiness.
[911.24] That’s what I am asking,
[912.96] what are you getting 
so happy about?
[915.20] Madam,
[916.84] I didn’t have any children of my own,
[920.52] when I heard of the happiness 
of a child coming to this home,
[924.56] I couldn’t stop myself.
[927.12] Whatever.
[943.48] Careful Mehreen. Careful.
[945.32] Hey, I am walking carefully.
[946.76] Careful. Careful.
[947.52] I was coming after you, 
what was the hurry?
[950.40] What is wrong with you people?
[951.56] You have all started to doing this.
[952.88] Come on. Come on.
[954.28] Careful. Careful. Careful.
[957.48] Hey, Waqar,
[959.24] it is not right for Mehreen to climb up
 and down the stairs like this.
[962.80] In this condition,
[963.92] I have told you people to come
 stay in the room downstairs.
[966.36] Hey mama, only if your 
daughter-in-law agrees.
[969.76] Why Mehreen?
[970.76] Hey mama,
[971.76] I am absolutely fine in my room.
[973.56] I feel comfortable.
[975.28] Hey child, the whole home is yours.
[980.00] Mama,
[981.12] ’
the goats for charity are here.
[983.40] Come on.
[985.08] Okay, you go ahead we will come.
[986.76] Sure.
[987.32] Shall we go?
[987.72] Come child.
[988.36] Yes. Yes.
[988.72] Careful.
[989.48] Slowly.
[997.48] Be careful. Slowly. . Slowly.
[1005.04] Slowly. Slowly
[1006.04] Come, mama.
[1007.56] Come put your hand on both of them.
[1018.20] I pray to God everything goes smoothly.
[1020.96] Wasai, see, get both
 the goats slaughtered
[1023.60] and have the meat 
distributed in the poor.
[1025.68] Sure.
[1026.52] Yes. Come on. Come on.
[1028.48] Be careful...
[1040.52] It feels as though a unique child
 is going to come in this home.
[1044.96] I will not let anyone take
 my Salman’s place so easily.
[1064.08] Mehreen, here you go, cold juice.
[1067.16] Hey sister-in-law, 
why did you bother?
[1070.04] You should have asked Wasai, 
she would have brought it.
[1072.12] Where is Wasai?
[1073.08] Hey, where is the botheration in this?
[1075.00] Wasai was busy in the kitchen,
[1076.40] I care about your health, 
so I brought it.
[1079.00] Stop Mehreen.
[1087.20] Take this.
[1089.64] Do you know the condition 
she is in, right?
[1092.00] In such a condition she 
shouldn’t drink anything cold.
[1098.92] Wasai. Wasai.
[1101.44] Yes, mama, coming.
[1103.36] I don’t know what the hell 
she is busy with all the time.
[1108.60] Yes?
[1111.92] Mehreen,
[1112.68] you will not eat or drink anything without asking me in future.
[1118.04] Do you understand?
[1128.72] No problem, sister-in-law, Shaista.
[1132.28] You know, mama knows better.
[1179.48] I haven’t seen this often that
[1182.16] the younger brother is
 a great businessman,
[1185.36] and the elder brother is just 
a manager in the same business.
[1188.00] You are right.
[1189.40] See, Mr. Waqar is 
a genius businessman
[1192.96] and Mr. Waqar has kept
 Mr. Idress as a manager,
[1195.16] based on the work he knows
[1197.00] and all this is a big thing.
[1200.52] It is a big miracle that a brother cares 
this much for another brother.
[1205.28] Absolutely sir.
[1244.76] Listen, what is the matter?
[1247.52] Are you feeling okay?
[1251.64] Leave how I feel,
[1253.84] in this home, only how 
Mehreen feels is important.
[1257.28] Meaning?
[1258.72] Meaning, today mama doubted me.
[1263.48] What doubt? What did mama say?
[1266.40] You tell me yourself,
[1269.04] am I someone’s enemy here?
[1273.04] I am the elder daughter-in-law 
of this home,
[1276.12] I have given this home its first heir.
[1280.76] I never wanted bad for Mehreen.
[1284.12] What has happened? Tell me this.
[1287.88] I was trying to give juice to Mehreen,
[1290.12] so mama stopped me.
[1293.96] That was juice Idrees,
[1295.68] and nothing else.
[1298.32] What did mama feel that
[1300.56] I added poison to it?
[1302.96] What does mama think that I
[1304.88] am the enemy of Mehreen
 or her future child.
[1309.76] There was never so much friction
 in the environment of this home.
[1313.12] Earlier, mama had never given
 importance to Mehreen over me,
[1318.32] and nor did she ignore
 Salman like this.
[1324.68] Come in.
[1332.56] Do you want something else?
[1335.08] No, keep sir’s coat.
[1339.72] Sure.
[1351.84] Waqar,
[1353.24] you just came from the office,
[1355.08] you must be tired.
[1356.60] You should rest.
[1357.96] But you are insisting on going out.
[1360.48] Careful. Careful.
[1361.88] I am not tired at all, Mehreen.
[1364.16] You stay locked up in home all day long,
[1366.92] you should step out of the home,
[1368.60] this will improve your mood.
[1371.72] I want to spent time with you.
[1374.60] Fine,
[1375.72] it is useless to argue with you.
[1379.04] Come on, come.
[1380.88] Mama. Mama.
[1383.20] I too want to come along.
[1384.92] Yes, come on. Let’s go.
[1387.44] Salman,
[1389.48] you are not going anywhere.
[1391.04] Why do you need to go? Come on.
[1392.56] No, I want to go with mama.
[1394.80] I told you that you are 
not going anywhere,
[1397.40] come with me.
[1398.20] Hey sister-in-law,
[1399.48] what is wrong with you?
[1401.00] If Salman wants to come with me, 
then what is bad in that?
[1406.32] Come on, Salman, we will go.
[1410.40] Careful. Careful, Mehreen.
[1440.80] Wasai, I have been
 noticing for a few days,
[1442.32] you are not focusing on work at all.
[1444.24] You don’t clean well, nothing at all.
[1446.48] You know I don’t like dirt at all.
[1449.80] You leave work whenever you want.
[1453.32] Mama, with you here,
[1457.84] the behavior of the younger ones 
is changing towards the elders.
[1460.64] Why? What happened Shaista?
[1464.96] You know,
[1466.36] I too am noticing changing
 behaviors in this home,
[1470.60] but I didn’t say it to anyone.
[1474.84] Mama, you know, Salman is my son.
[1478.92] Hey, everyone knows that.
[1482.00] But what you have forgotten is that
[1484.12] Salman and Mehreen 
love each other a lot.
[1487.64] You have just given birth to Salman,
[1490.04] I think you forgot this.
[1491.64] Salman is a child
[1493.72] and children do what they want.
[1497.08] So, mama, don’t you think that
[1499.32] when Mehreen has her own child,
[1502.76] then will she still give 
Salman so much importance?
[1507.96] Salman will have no worth, mama.
[1511.48] And you think
[1512.64] if Salman is ignored
[1516.76] then his personality will get shattered.
[1519.40] You stop thinking this Shaista,
[1522.12] no one will ignore him.
[1524.84] I apologize mama,
[1527.44] but what you think
[1531.00] doesn’t seem to be happening.
[1605.16] It is your job to make 
Shaista understand,
[1608.04] she is spoiling the environment of this 
home with her useless insistence.
[1612.20] But mama,
[1613.40] she will not want what
 is bad for Mehreen.
[1616.08] I never thought this.
[1620.68] But I cannot ignore being careful.
[1626.52] Mama, then the thing has
 come to the same point.
[1632.84] The glass has juice,
 it didn’t have poison.
[1639.04] I think Shaista made you 
memorize your lesson well.
[1644.44] Mama, what direction are you
 taking the conversation to?
[1646.88] Firstly, cold diet is not 
suitable for Mehreen
[1652.92] and when things have come to this,
[1655.00] then I have no hesitation in saying this,
[1657.20] that I fear Shaista’s behavior now.
[1660.60] What fear mama?
[1662.16] The fear of being envious.
[1663.56] Making yourself be seen as great 
and degrading someone,
[1666.16] this is what leads to envy.
[1672.72] But I will not take any risk till the
 birth of Mehreen’s first child.
[1712.20] Salman, wake up.
[1714.64] Come on. Careful. Careful, Mehreen.
[1716.80] Careful.
[1718.60] Take out Salman,
 I think he slept at the back.
[1722.32] Salman, get up son. Come on.
[1724.16] We are home. Wake up.
[1726.04] Come on.
[1727.12] Come on.
[1727.68] Come on, my son is tired. Come.
[1741.20] Come on, are you sleepy?
[1745.08] Waqar, hand him over to me. Come on.
[1746.72] Sure, sister-in-law.
[1747.48] Sister-in-law where are you taking Salman?
[1750.12] Salman sleeps with us.
[1753.96] Yes, but
[1756.04] from today he will sleep in his own room.
[1758.00] Sister-in-law, he cannot sleep without me.
[1762.40] Now Salman should get 
used to sleeping with you,
[1770.56] and you too. Come on.
[1780.52] Hey child…
[1782.00] Mama, what happened to
 sister-in-law Shaista?
[1785.56] Hey child, why do you tire yourself?
[1789.52] Don’t take any tension in this condition.
[1793.32] Waqar, son you take Mehreen.
[1797.24] Take her carefully.
[1799.12] Yes, mama.
[1801.84] Mama, I will sleep with you.
[1805.68] Yes, my love,
[1807.16] we will both sleep together.
[1809.04] My child. Shall we go now?
[1811.80] Come on.
[1813.56] Goodnight mama.
[1814.80] Goodnight son.
[1876.64] Elder madam, careful.
[1887.00] Salman. Salman. Sal….
[1897.76] Salman.
[1899.16] Mehreen.
[1900.20] Salman.
[1901.52] Elder madam, Salman.
[1903.32] Madam, come to your senses.
[1905.56] Salman is fine, Mehreen.
[1906.60] Salman, is fine. Mehreen.
[1908.40] Elder madam. Elder madam, 
get up. Elder madam…
[1925.60] Grandma, I want to go to mama.
[1930.12] Child. You know mama is not well.
[1935.28] Grandma, what happened to my mama?
[1939.12] Child, mama is not well,
[1942.36] she will come.
[1944.60] If you insist like this,
[1945.80] then mama will get worried, child.
[1953.68] Doctor, how is Mehreen?
[1955.96] Sir, the thing is that the patient
 is not in a good condition,
[1960.44] she needs intensive care.
[1963.24] There are some complications,
[1964.80] but we are trying our best
[1966.72] to save the life of both 
the mother and child.
[1974.16] Doctor, do anything, 
try to save them. Please.
[1978.60] We are putting in all our effort,
[1980.48] you people too pray, please,
[1982.08] and don’t worry.
[1984.48] Fine doctor, thank you very much.
[1993.88] Mama, my mother is calling.
[1997.20] I will just come.
[2009.64] Pray for mama, child.
[2015.40] Don’t worry, son.
[2025.80] Greetings mama.
[2027.96] Yes,
[2029.24] I am still in the hospital.
[2033.08] No news till now.
[2035.64] No good news till now.
[2041.76] You just pray.
[2044.68] Okay, I will talk to you later. 
Okay? Bye.
[2054.68] Whatever is happening,
[2057.68] at least it is best for my Salman.
[2063.80] I feel time and fate is blessing my wish.
[2069.36] Poor things,
[2070.64] they are all waiting for good news.
[2076.24] They don’t even know that
[2079.24] the good news they are waiting
[2082.88] for died on the way a long time back
[2090.84] Shaista, where is everyone?
[2093.72] Yes, there.
[2095.68] Come on. Come.
[2101.24] Waqar, any news?
[2104.20] Brother till now….
[2108.28] Doctor, please give me a good news.
[2110.12] Congratulations to you all, it is a girl.
[2118.60] But doctor, how is 
my daughter-in-law, Mehreen?
[2121.52] She is also fine.
[2122.56] She is a little traumatized,
[2124.48] but she will recover gradually.
[2129.00] And maybe…
[2132.56] Maybe what, doctor?
[2135.72] Maybe she can 
never be a mother now.
[2147.84] But still congratulations 
on having a cute little baby girl.
[2152.16] We will shift the patient
 to the ward soon.
[2156.72] Thank you doctor.
[2158.76] Congratulations. Congratulations.

[2253.52] This has your dress as well,
[2254.92] and whatever is left,
[2256.28] give it to the rest of the servants.
[2258.28] Thank you very much, mama.
[2262.68] Waqar, son, I don’t see Mehreen.
[2266.36] Mama, she is resting.
[2271.44] Waqar, Mehreen looks 
really weak, take care.
[2274.32] Sure. ,
[2275.36] Mama, I have some work,
 I will leave.
[2277.48] Okay son.
[2281.60] Son, Waqar,
[2282.96] seeing you and Mehreen happy
[2285.04] has made my heart happy.
[2288.96] Happiness has returned 
to this home after long.
[2292.28] Yes, mama,
[2294.00] it is all because of your prayers.
[2297.80] Live long.
[2315.56] May God protect you, my life.
[2318.92] My life.
[2320.00] Oh, you are sleepy.
[2322.84] My child.
[2324.00] Mama’s love is sleepy.
[2328.52] Lovely baby.
[2330.72] Elder madam,
[2333.56] if you allow me, 
then can I say something?
[2337.20] Go ahead, Wasai.
[2338.24] If you don’t mind,
[2340.24] then can I pick up little 
madam in my arms?
[2347.08] What are you saying, Wasai?
[2349.04] Now you have to take care of her.
[2351.08] Thank you very much.
[2352.44] Go. Go to Wasai Bi.
[2358.04] Little madam is really beautiful.
[2363.88] May God protect her 
from the evil eye.
[2366.60] Amen. Amen.
[2368.36] Here you go, madam.
[2370.36] That’s it, Wasai?
[2371.64] Yes.
[2372.28] Come. Come. Mama’s love.
[2376.00] That’s it, Wasai is tired.
[2380.64] Are you happy now, Wasai?
[2382.32] Yes, yes,
[2383.36] thank you very much.
[2385.20] Actually, I don’t have a child,
[2388.96] so seeing the child I couldn’t resist.
[2392.92] No problem Wasai,
[2394.32] you will take care of her.
[2395.80] Yes, sure.
[2398.72] Do you want it? Do you want it?
[2400.52] Mama’s love. Oh, okay.
[2404.40] Salman, son,
[2405.52] why are you not sleepy? 
Sleep my son.
[2408.04] No, I have to go to mama.
[2412.36] Why do you want to go to mama?
[2414.72] There is no place for you there.
[2416.80] How many times have 
I made you understand?
[2418.76] Come on, go to sleepy.
[2420.48] No, I said I will go to mama.
[2424.20] Child, she is not your mama…
[2427.00] I mean, your mama is not well,
[2429.36] you can go meet her tomorrow.
[2431.20] No, I have to go to mama right now.
[2435.04] Salman. Salman, stop, son. Salman.
[2439.40] Let him go, Shaista.
[2440.64] He will not stop.
[2442.24] He is really attached to Mehreen.
[2444.48] No issues.
[2458.12] She is very sleepy.
[2460.28] It is time to sleep.
[2461.44] Time to sleep.
[2461.96] Mama, can I sleep here?
[2464.88] Why not Salman? Come on.
 Come to mama.
[2468.12] One second. One second my love.
[2470.80] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2473.80] Come lie down here, love.
[2497.92] Here you go.
[2502.32] Look at this, mama.
[2508.60] Areej.
[2510.04] It is so pretty. See, Mehreen.
[2515.56] It is a very pretty name.
[2518.52] So, you gave her the 
name you liked, right?
[2521.52] Yes, because Areej is a pretty name.
[2525.40] Right, mama?
[2526.80] Yes, it is a pretty name, child.
[2530.04] Now our entire home will smell of her scent.
[2538.00] Here you go, mama,
[2539.08] make Areej wear it 
with your own hands.
[2541.40] I will remove it.
[2544.48] My little doll.
[2546.44] Here you go.
[2555.20] Sir, the documents are ready.
[2557.56] You have a look at them once,
[2561.52] then I will get them signed by the lawyer.
[2566.48] Fine, Mr. Hashim.
[2568.72] But did you get it checked
 by the legal committee?
[2571.20] Yes, sir, I had it checked.
[2581.96] Waqar, what are documents for?
[2586.36] I have put all my property, my business,
 this home in Areej’s name.
[2602.36] You put everything in Areej’s name?
[2606.40] Yes, Mehreen child,
[2608.68] even if you give your life for your
 daughters, it is not enough.
[2612.56] The daughters are such beings.
[2619.40] and my Salman?
[2622.92] Don’t worry, Mehreen,
[2624.88] I will not do any injustice with him either.
[2628.60] Okay sir,
[2629.32] me and Mr. Idrees are going to the site,
[2631.56] so we will go now.
[2633.08] Fine, Mr. Hashim, you reach, 
we are coming.
[2636.48] Okay sir.
[2637.36] Thank you.
[2639.16] Where are you going, son?
[2642.44] Today we are going to lay the foundation
 of our new factory, Areej Textile.
[2647.32] [00:44:
[2651.40] ]and my daughter
 too will come with us.
[2662.32] Shaista, what happened? 
Why are you so angry?
[2668.84] Nothing happened.
[2670.20] If nothing happened, then
[2671.40] why is madam so upset?
[2673.16] What is the matter?
[2676.08] What do you want?
[2678.04] I have a fire burning in my heart
[2680.44] and there is no smoke.
[2682.24] Yes, that is true.
[2683.56] If you tell me, then I will also help 
you in putting out the fire.
[2686.88] The thing is that Waqar and Mehreen 
just love Salman for show.
[2694.40] They just call him their son.
[2697.88] Idrees my son is not a toy,
[2700.76] nor is he a decoration piece
[2703.48] with which Mehreen and 
Waqar want to use to spend time.
[2706.48] That’s not true,
 they really love Salman.
[2710.04] Leave it,
[2712.64] they couldn’t even put a 100-yard 
plot in Salman’s name
[2718.00] and what all are they 
not giving to their daughter.
[2720.96] Can you not see that?
[2723.84] What is wrong, Shaista?
[2725.44] All the properties are in
 Waqar’s name,
[2727.00] he will put it in his child’s name, right?
[2729.52] You have expectations for no reason.
[2731.24] When does this happen?
[2732.48] Right now, you won’t understand me,
[2736.24] but if Salman attaches 
his hope with this love,
[2742.56] then you will get the answer 
to all my questions.
[2747.24] Okay, come on.
[2767.48] All the property, business, factories,
[2772.68] everything has been put in Areej’s name.
[2777.52] What will my Salman be left with?
[2782.92] Now Salman won’t even 
have love in his share.
[2788.84] Salman, come quickly son, 
we are getting late.
[2792.28] Come on, son, Salman, 
your uncle Waqar is waiting downstairs.
[2797.44] Come on. Come. Come on.
[2800.84] We will go. 
Lovely baby will go. My love.
[2807.36] Oh, it is hot. It is hot.
 Sun. Sun. Sun.
[2811.64] We will sit quickly. Mama’s love.
[2825.16] I want to go with mama.
[2827.56] Come on.
[2828.08] No, you will sit with me. Come on.
[2829.96] No, I am not going.
[2833.32] Salman. Salman.
[2835.16] Sister-in-law, take her.
[2836.04] No Mehreen, you sit inside.
[2837.48] We cannot agree to
 him all the time. Sit.
[2839.44] Sister-in-law…
[2840.20] No. sit. Come on, sit. Sit. Sit. Sit.
[2843.36] Wasai. Wasai.
[2845.88] Coming, madam.
[2847.76] Take care of Salman, 
we are going.
[2850.40] Sure.
[2854.80] Goodbye.
[2855.64] Goodbye.
