[39.20] Arooj.
[40.00] Huh?
[46.64] What happened? 
Why are you so scared?
[62.68] I feel now me and Areej 
are not safe in this home.
[81.24] I am really scared.
[84.84] Since you found 
out about yourself,
[93.24] you have a unknown 
fear inside you.
[95.36] This is not an unknown fear,
[104.36] I know the character 
of this fear well.
[114.04] But I don’t understand 
what is the reason behind it.
[121.44] Are you talking about aunt?
[135.08] Did you not see aunt’s 
behaviour today?
[148.84] She was reacting in 
such a weird manner.
[158.12] I have started to be afraid of her.
[176.60] Don’t worry,
[179.96] everything will be fine.
[181.88] j
[265.96] Was this so?
[269.28] Then fine, if papa had this dream,
[272.96] then we will surely 
setup a mill there.
[276.52] But this states that the mill that
[279.92] was being made was
 in Areej’s name.
[280.80] it was Areej textile.
[286.24] Who is this Areej?
[288.44] Why don’t I know about this?
[292.20] Actually son,
[295.68] your mama, sister in law
 really liked this name.
[299.36] There is nothing else about it.
[303.24] Are you sure?
[304.84] Yes,
[306.20] but don’t mention 
this in front of her,
[310.12] because then
 she misses late Waqar
[313.96] and she starts getting unwell.
[317.60] You understand what 
I am saying son?
[349.32] Is everything fine, Salman?
[352.64] Uncle, what is all this?
[358.12] I am looking at some
 old documents
[360.28] and these are some property files,
[361.84] all of these are in the name of Areej.
[363.12] Who is she?
[373.72] I had told you,
[375.48] Mehreen liked the name…
[377.96] How can so much happen
 on her liking a name
[381.44] and we don’t know about it.
[386.96] Actually, son, the thing is,
[388.60] I don’t know about this.
[393.28] Late Waqar used to take 
care of everything.
[395.72] Whatever he did 
would be the final word,
[397.64] I never even questioned him.
[408.56] If you ask me honestly,
[409.32] I had never even thought
[410.52] that I would have to 
live without my brother
[413.16] and I would have to take care
 of this entire business.
[421.96] But maybe that’s 
what God willed.
[430.24] Son, you got stuck in the files.
[432.40] I never even opened
 and saw them.
[444.24] I cannot see.
[446.84] This has signatures of 
late Waqar in them.
[458.72] My heart starts to explode.
[463.76] What do I do?
[649.08] She turned out to be so cunning.
[652.72] What did she name her child?
[655.36] Areej.
[662.24] Slowly and gradually,
[663.28] she wants to take over everything.
[670.80] For us,
[673.52] the danger is increasing 
every passing moment.
[676.84] You are right.
[681.84] Where are you going?
[683.92] No where, I will come.
[685.44] Shaista, I am scared of you.
[688.08] Don’t do anything in your emotions,
[690.08] that things become easier for Arooj.
[693.52] I have become emotional Idrees,
[699.88] but don’t worry,
[701.80] I am not stupid.
[733.12] It is Waqar’s attachment,
[734.40] his daughter’s attachment,
[735.32] so don’t sell the land.
[736.44] So I didn’t sell it
[737.80] and till Salman grew up,
[739.32] I took care of the factory.
[740.64] Waqar must have thought
[742.24] that putting everything 
in Areej’s name
[744.64] will make us dependent on her.
[750.36] But still everything belongs to us.
[753.84] What are you saying, Shaista?
[756.60] Waqar was my younger brother,
[758.00] and Areej is my niece.
[759.68] Really?
[760.84] But your younger brother
[762.56] never treated you like a brother.
[770.08] He always kept you as his employee.
[773.28] I have no sorrow about this.
[775.44] Because late Waqar setup
 the whole business and empire,
[778.80] not me.
[782.04] Anyway,
[783.12] Mehreen did only one good 
thing throughout her life
[787.20] that she considered our 
son Salman her own.
[794.88] Salman, you have gotten 
in the wrong search, son.
[800.76] You have no idea,
[805.52] you are moving towards an explosive
 tunnel, without any safety measures.
[813.40] Trying to untangle this string,
[818.60] you will get tangled badly.
[823.92] The enemy’s hands 
will become stronger.
[874.56] yes, Idrees.
[876.12] Shaista,
[878.00] I am really confused,
[879.08] I am really worried.
[880.88] Why? What happened Idrees?
[884.72] I feel we will get stuck in a big worry.
[888.20] What do you mean?
[890.12] Look Idrees, 
I am already really worried.
[893.28] Don’t worry my heart further,
[895.20] tell me quickly what happened?
[898.80] Salman is after the name Areej.
[902.72] Okay,
[904.80] that’s how it is. So, then?
[908.36] I feel he has a doubt in his heart and
[911.40] he will know the secret.
[913.36] No. No.
[914.44] No, Idrees,
[915.72] if this happens,
[917.52] everything will be over.
[923.68] It will all be over.
[925.92] We will not be left with anything.
[927.60] And look at our bad luck
[929.04] that this Areej came in 
our life as Arooj.
[932.48] That is what I think too,
[934.84] I never heard of something like this.
[942.80] Such coincidences only
 happen in dramas,
[946.20] and here it has happened with us.
[948.36] Our life will become a drama soon.
[950.48] That’s why, Idrees. That’s why
[952.72] I am ready to go to any extreme.
[957.80] But this Arooj has good luck,
[959.52] that she survives everything.
[962.56] You will not do anything.
[963.84] What do you mean?
[965.56] Now you will leave everything
 to the situation?
[970.24] No, no.
[972.32] Listen to me,
[973.56] you always talk.
[975.40] You just talk, listen to me.
[978.36] Okay, tell me.
[979.96] You will not do anything now.
[982.20] I will talk to the lawyer
[984.48] about how we handle
 the matters of property.
[991.80] Okay?
[993.04] You will not do anything.
[995.28] I will put the phone down now.
[998.60] Okay?
[1089.12] But I need the rights as Waqar 
to work independently.
[1092.84] Yes, those became yours
 automatically after Waqar’s death, right?
[1097.36] No, that’s not true, Shaista.
[1099.44] The board directors decide
 this or the board head.
[1103.84] And who is the head of the board?
[1107.04] After Waqar,
[1108.52] the head of the board is Mehreen,
[1114.16] if she signs then
[1116.56] I will automatically get the rights.
[1122.92] Fine, don’t worry.
[1125.80] Mehreen is mentally 
disabled anyway.
[1129.44] It won’t be an issue to
 get a signature from her.
[1131.60] I will get the signatures from her.
[1134.60] Really? Is that true?
[1138.20] Wait.
[1144.60] So here you go.
[1245.68] We have named her Areej.
[1250.36] And we want that
[1252.40] you make Areej wear this bracelet.
[1309.52] We want that you bring her up.
[1318.76] Me?
[1320.04] How will I be able to 
take care of her.
[1321.80] Salman…
[1324.80] No one cares more than you
[1327.52] no one can bring her 
up better than you.
[1376.12] What is this?
[1378.00] I have made soup for you.
[1380.12] I don’t want to eat or 
drink anything you make.
[1393.00] Okay.
[1395.80] You drink it with your own hands,
[1398.20] I just made it.
[1399.88] I told you,
[1401.52] I don’t want to drink it.
[1404.28] You will have to drink it
[1406.04] and that too for ten days,
[1407.60] because this is your diet plan.
[1411.24] You are just saying 
what you want to,
[1413.08] you don’t care about anything I say?
[1415.36] I care.
[1416.48] I care about your health,
[1417.96] that is why I am asking you.
[1420.40] Why do you care?
[1422.64] Let me die.
[1424.32] Please aunty,
[1425.76] don’t say these things.
[1431.92] You have to live for Salman’s sake,
 for Areej’s sake.
[1646.80] Sit, Wasai.
[1650.76] Hey, you sat on the floor again.
[1653.36] Don’t sit on the floor
 in front of me.
[1655.76] You are my elder.
[1657.32] Come on, come sit up.
[1659.52] Madam saw me sitting 
with you on the sofa once,
[1665.68] she scolded me a lot.
[1669.20] Wasai, you sit up.
[1673.44] I am fine here.
[1676.04] Wasai,
[1676.88] I told you to get up and
 sit here with me.
[1680.00] Come.
[1681.00] If madam sees me…
[1683.48] I will answer her.
[1685.84] Come on.
[1698.80] Tell me something, Wasai.
[1702.08] Ask me, younger madam.
[1705.08] What has happened to 
aunt’s behaviour?
[1716.84] Why has she suddenly 
started to hate me so much?
[1739.40] Younger madam,
[1741.96] I have told you the 
entire incident.
[1745.92] Still you don’t get it?
[1749.84] I don’t understand, Wasai,
[1753.96] what is the reason for
 this behaviour of hers.
[1763.56] First, an attempt was
 made on my life,
[1768.08] after that, she tried to 
play with my child’s life.
[1778.72] Why is she doing all this?
[1784.28] This matter of wealth is really bad.
[1797.00] It makes you do everything.
[1801.64] I don’t understand.
[1803.36] Meaning,
[1805.60] this home this wealth,
[1808.80] this entire business 
belonged to elder sir.
[1820.00] And on your birth,
[1822.56] elder sir had put everything
 in your name.
[1841.92] What are you saying, Wasai?
[1846.68] I am right, younger madam.
[1858.56] All this is yours.
[1860.80] You are the owner of it.
[1864.04] These are the papers 
of Waqar Ahmed’s
[1868.24] entire wealth and his 
business ownership,
[1871.76] and according to this,
[1873.84] the owner of everything is
[1878.12] late Mr. Waqar’s widow Mehreen
[1881.04] and his daughter Areej.
[1890.56] What are you saying, 
Mr. lawyer?
[1895.04] Everything has been done in
 the name of Mehreen and Areej
[1903.92] No, no, it can’t be
[1906.60] But these documents have been 
made on the request of late Waqar
[1912.00] And Idris knows
[1914.84] that I am the legal 
advisor of the company
[1918.80] And these papers 
were entrusted to me
[1921.76] Madam I would like 
you to handle this
[1967.96] Oh.
[1971.52] So this is why she wants 
to remove me from her way.
[1982.24] Meaning,
[1984.96] she is dreaming of ruling this home.
[1994.44] I will not let what you think happen.
[2001.96] My beloved aunt,
[2029.40] Oh, Areej.
[2034.28] That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.
[2037.92] Grandma’s love. That’s it. That’s it.
[2040.68] That’s it. Hey, Areej.
[2046.88] Wasai.
[2049.72] Wasai.
[2059.80] That’s it. That’s it.
[2063.28] Wait Wasai,
[2065.40] you won’t go anywhere.
[2067.48] But elder madam has called me.
[2070.64] I am telling you,
[2074.64] sit down.
[2125.48] Come to grandma’s arm.
[2126.36] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[2127.48] Grandma’s princess.
[2129.72] Come in grandma’s arms.
[2131.84] Come on.
[2132.88] Come on. Grandma’s beloved.
[2135.12] Mama’s life.
[2136.84] Papa’s doll.
[2138.80] She is papa’s princess.
[2159.96] Did you see?
[2165.72] She has gotten quiet.
[2168.44] Yes.
[2173.52] She doesn’t even know
[2176.80] who is in her arms.
[2186.88] But Areej recognizes the 
scent of motherhood well.
[2197.04] You are right, younger madam.
[2207.88] She is the mother of Areej’s mother,
[2211.88] how will she not get
 the peace of motherhood.
[2230.92] Now you can leave, Wasai.
[2233.68] But Areej…
[2236.56] I will take care of her.
[2238.80] You go do your work in the kitchen.
[2242.60] As you order me.
[2270.64] I am really happy that
[2274.64] the distances between you
 and mom have reduced.
[2282.08] What did the doctor say?
[2285.36] There is no danger,
[2289.72] but they have said that
[2290.64] we shouldn’t say anything in front
[2293.20] of mom that stresses her.
[2300.24] But I don’t understand that
[2303.00] it was a happy occasion,
[2304.32] then why did mom take stress?
[2311.04] Did someone say something?
[2314.28] No.
[2315.64] Nothing like that happened.
[2320.24] Tell me something.
[2323.32] You knew mom really 
liked the name, Areej, right?
