[23.28] Wasai.
[25.76] Wasai. 
Yes, coming.
[32.76] Yes, younger madam.
[34.52] Where is Salman?
[36.44] He has come from the office,
[38.40] and he didn’t even come 
to the room.
[40.32] He outside in the lawn.
[58.80] Only Salman is responsible 
for this condition of mama.
[66.32] What does she want from him?
[68.60] Just a little love.
[73.20] And Salman is crossing the limit.
[77.56] What can I…
[84.00] I know,
[86.32] what can you say to anyone.
[93.04] Here, no one is willing 
to listen to anyone.
[96.84] I will see.
[109.24] God,
[111.52] have mercy on the condition 
of this home.
[141.44] How can you talk to me like this?
[146.08] Really?
[149.08] So, now you will teach me, 
how I should talk to you?
[155.96] Tell me,
[159.00] what have you come here for?
[163.16] Salman,
[167.16] you kept on walking on the terrace
all night long.
[174.64] You didn’t even come 
to the room.
[178.88] I know you are worried.
[188.80] Won’t you share it with me?
[190.36] Why should I share it with you?
[193.20] Because I am your wife.
[205.96] I had thought I would tell you myself,
[211.48] but you had promised me that
[214.80] you will help me in finding my parents.
[220.08] Forgive me, considering it a mistake.
[225.60] How can you be so stone hearted?
[229.16] She loves you so much. You know,
[231.60] she has not slept for two nights.
[233.24] So, what do I do?
[236.96] I have not taken up the responsibility
 of showing mercy on someone.
[240.08] Salman.
[244.16] She is not someone.
[249.48] She has loved you for 
twenty five years.
[254.92] She is your mother,
[257.36] and you are still calling her 
aunt Mehreen.
[303.68] Salman,
[305.92] you have been home for so long,
[308.20] you didn’t even come to the room.
[310.52] I feel suffocated in that corner.
[313.36] Go from here.
[315.48] I have no fault.
[317.36] In fact, no one has a fault…
Arooj, shut up.
[326.24] Stop this emotional drama of yours,
[328.08] go from here.
[330.88] What is this noise?
[332.84] Huh?
[338.76] Can you not see 
he is in a bad mood?
[343.44] Still you are disturbing him.
[345.32] I am talking to him. 
I am not disturbing him.
[347.76] You are disturbing him.
[353.92] Salman, son, 
you can go.
[359.84] You have come home tired 
from the office,
[362.44] you can lie down in my room. 
Go, come on.
[364.76] Sure, mom.
[377.16] And you too leave.
[382.80] Now Salman will stay with his mother,
[385.36] and you stay with your mother.
[388.36] My relation has suffered most in 
the battle between you two mothers.
[393.80] This relation is also only there 
for a few days.
[433.20] Now tell me,
[435.04] what you feel after hearing 
all that I said?
[438.28] Will Salman leave me?
[440.72] Arooj, I don’t understand 
brother Salman at all.
[443.48] Earlier he used to listen 
to aunt Mehreen,
[445.88] and now his parents.
[451.04] Why doesn’t he think 
anything himself?
[454.44] I don’t understand 
what Salman wants.
[460.12] Arooj, I feel he is going through
a big shock,
[464.24] you should let him be.
[469.52] Will doing this be right?
[473.40] Man,
[475.04] that’s what I believe in.
[574.40] Arooj, I had told you
[576.64] that Shaista will turn out to be an even 
worse mother-in-law than Mehreen.
[579.44] Look at my prediction.
[591.72] At times I think that what is 
happening with you is not right,
[595.36] I feel you have holes 
in your hands.
[606.32] Check, Check. Check
 if I am right or not.
[624.08] Hah,
[625.72] no, you won’t be able to see it, 
but I see it.
[628.60] You have holes in your hands.
[645.16] Because when Salman used 
to be a good husband,
[647.76] you couldn’t control Mehreen,
[658.28] and when you found 
the relation of your mother,
[660.84] your husband got distanced from you.
[663.96] I feel you don’t know 
how-to live-in relations.
[711.80] Relations are not kept in hands,
[714.24] they are kept in hearts.
[721.48] You count money with your hands.
[730.32] You don’t weigh emotions.
[737.72] Hah,
[740.00] but how would you know?
[744.08] You are that man who made 
your own son
[747.00] your nephew in the greed for money,
[750.04] and I am so stupid,
[752.96] I am making you understand all this.
[757.80] You are only left with words 
to talk about.
[761.20] Go ahead, talk as much as
 you want.
[763.12] I am making you understand 
for the last time.
[770.44] You and aunt,
[774.64] move from between Salman and I
[785.56] or don’t expect any good
 from me either.
[839.40] I feel she too has gone 
crazy like Mehreen.
[914.12] Now this puppet show is over.
[916.64] Salman will not listen
to you or Mehreen,
[920.08] because he has learned
[921.92] that I am his father and 
Shaista is his mother.
[925.72] Even if Salman has found out 
about this,
[928.64] then what is the reason for 
hating me and my mother?
[932.52] Very smart.
[934.28] You have found out really soon 
that Salman hates you.
[937.80] Yes, but why?
[939.36] It is better that you don’t get 
into this argument,
[942.48] and prepare to leave from 
Salman’s life, now.
[947.08] What are you saying?
[949.36] I am Salman’s wife.
[951.04] More than that you are 
Mehreen’s daughter.
[954.24] Okay,
[956.32] so Salman is speaking 
your language.
[960.76] See how you are talking
[963.80] and Shaista will stop 
this tongue on yours,
[967.16] because you are her daughter-in-law
[968.68] and she is your mother-in-law.
[978.52] What will you say and
what will I have to do?
[982.12] Good,
[983.88] so you are ready for the deal?
[986.44] What if I say no, then?
[988.32] You don’t have the option 
to say no.
[990.96] Think about it,
it is up to you.
[994.04] What have I done to you?
[996.64] You have done a lot to me
[1000.96] and you know I deserve 
to take revenge.
[1005.56] Now,
[1007.96] you will take revenge from me?
[1015.68] I leave this to you too.
[1020.04] If you agree to me, then that’s it.
[1025.36] Then you won’t take revenge?
[1028.48] Nice,
[1030.32] your statement has your 
admission of crime.
[1033.60] Answer me.
[1048.04] They are really greedy people.
[1055.80] Whatever happened in the past, 
happened.
[1064.44] But now everyone can 
live together again.
[1068.12] But no,
[1075.72] these people are not those 
who will live together.
[1083.24] They only know how to torture.
[1093.88] Maybe love hasn’t even
touched their lives
[1102.60] and my mother?
[1105.92] She only wants love.
[1162.96] Younger madam,
[1173.84] getting happiness is a difficult 
thing to do.
[1189.20] At times you get it,
[1192.76] and at times your efforts 
go to waste.
[1197.92] Hmmm.
[1199.88] You are absolutely right.
[1202.96] Some relations support you
[1212.08] and some look away from you.
[1217.20] That’s how it is.
[1238.28] Can I ask you something?
[1240.40] Go ahead.
[1246.08] I feel that
[1249.28] uncle and aunt will not accept 
my relation with Salman.
[1262.76] And this relation of ours 
will end soon.
[1272.16] Younger madam,
[1275.20] don’t worry.
[1280.68] You don’t worry at all.
[1284.28] How is that?
[1288.04] Because,
[1290.72] that elder sir and madam are 
really greedy people.
[1307.96] And everything in this home
 is in your name.
[1323.44] He will never let you get out
of their hands.
[1380.76] Second thing,
[1384.28] Salman.
[1390.44] You will not cause Salman any 
form of financial loss and also,
[1396.48] I am doing this for Salman
and not you,
[1406.88] because he really respects you.
[1415.00] I hope you will stay true to this
[1424.68] or else I have all the proof with me.
[1502.48] What had to happen, 
what had to pass, has passed.
[1505.60] Now you don’t need to drag me 
in my past, aunt Mehreen.
[1510.56] Aunty?
[1514.16] You called me aunty?
[1518.92] Yes, I did.
[1521.48] And I will call you the same 
in future as well.
[1527.56] All of you.
[1528.84] Especially you.
[1530.84] You ruined my life.
[1533.32] To save your life, you took away 
my entire childhood.
[1536.80] Salman. 
Stay away.
[1539.36] Go away from me.
[1543.12] There is no need for you to come
in front of me in future.
[1545.96] Salman.
[1551.56] You have found your daughter,
[1556.60] save these emotions for her.
[1589.64] You still haven’t slept?
[1593.76] You too still haven’t slept.
[1596.72] I was working.
[1601.48] You went to convince Salman?
[1612.60] That’s how it happens.
[1615.88] When someone loves another,
[1619.36] they try to convince them.
[1629.72] He surely wouldn’t have agreed.
[1633.84] He is really stubborn.
[1636.56] When one thing gets 
stuck in his mind,
[1639.04] it is not possible to convince him.
[1645.84] Are you consoling yourself or me,
[1650.32] by telling me about 
Salman’s temperament?
[1654.00] Both of us.
[1660.84] Love is both our pain.
[1671.28] Salman will understand soon.
[1674.88] We will have to make him 
understand, mama.
[1684.12] But if uncle and aunt let him think
something else, then.
[1694.24] Now, it is enough.
[1697.16] I will have to do something.
[1700.44] What if, they distance us 
completely from Salman.
[1766.68] She still hasn’t served breakfast.
Wasai.
[1769.36] Wasai.
[1771.84] Coming madam.
[1774.24] You still haven’t served breakfast?
[1777.12] Elder madam…
[1797.28] When mama comes, 
we will have breakfast.
[1813.44] What is this nonsense? For so long, 
we have had to wait for Mehreen.
[1829.00] Wasai, you serve breakfast.
[1830.80] Salman, son, come on 
let’s have breakfast.
[1832.36] You are here, you are important. 
After that there is no need for anyone.
[1852.56] Leave it, dad.
[1882.68] I will go to the office and have it.
[1935.96] Mama.
[1940.56] Come on, lets both of us go 
and have breakfast.
[1956.32] Younger madam, 
your guests have come.
[1966.00] I have asked them 
to come inside.
[1974.12] They are not my guests.
[1998.84] They are uncle’s guests.
[2049.72] Aunt, meet her,
[2052.88] she too is my aunt.
