[24.52] There is nothing to worry about.
[26.28] This is good news.
[33.44] What do you mean?
[34.96] She is pregnant,
[42.32] and you are going to be a father.
[65.68] I will prescribe some medication,
[67.84] you just give it to her on time.
[80.44] And a healthy child will
be added to your family.
[93.00] I will take your leave now.
[96.88] Take care of yourself.
[117.84] If you don’t mind, then
[119.56] please leave us alone for a while.
[127.16] Yes.
[129.36] Absolutely. I will leave.
[141.72] But, tell me,
[146.36] who do I need to congratulate?
[157.08] You,
[159.32] Nosherwan Saeein,
[162.44] or Sarfaraz?
[166.60] What nonsense is this?
[168.40] I am talking nonsense?
[170.68] He was saying that…
[171.96] What was he saying?
[175.44] Dua,
[178.24] I had heard both of you talk.
[190.68] Now,
[192.88] I don’t understand
what I should say.
[207.64] Still,
[209.36] this is a personal
matter between you two,
[213.28] I shouldn't be getting involved.
[222.72] Excuse me.
[301.16] Now Dua is going to
give Nosherwan an heir.
[305.44] How will I remove her from
Nosherwan's life now?
[336.72] Even after receiving such
a big happiness,
[338.36] Ghaznavi didn't say a word to me.
[347.76] Why has Ghaznavi become restless
instead of happy after hearing this news?
[353.44] He said that he divorced your sister
[355.96] so that he could marry you.
[358.88] Tell me, is this a lie?
[360.92] Is this something so small
that you hide it from me?
[362.84] Please,
[363.44] I just wanted to keep
you away from stress.
[365.60] Stress?
[369.32] The truth is that your
actions are stressing me.
[372.32] Are you doubting me?
[374.84] Yes.
[424.40] The thing is that
if the two of us live together,
[428.88] that has our happiness in it.
[432.64] And it was my job to lift
the veil from your eyes,
[435.72] which I have done.
[437.60] Now, it's up to you.
[443.12] I think it would be better
if you separate your paths from her
[447.04] and divorce her.
[476.72] Are you not happy?
[482.32] Happy about what?
[486.48] Such great good news
is going to come to our home.
[493.60] I am surprised
[495.20] that you are asking me and
[496.28] I don’t even see any
happiness on your face.
[502.32] When I feel happiness,
I'll be happy as well.
[509.88] Right now, I don’t feel anything.
[514.64] What do you mean?
[516.32] I don’t understand.
[518.92] Even I am not able to understand it.
[521.92] When I understand,
I will make you understand, as well.
[556.68] Deen Mohammad, who sent this?
[559.00] Hey, Amma Saeein,
[560.20] I have received the sweets
and fruits you sent.
[562.88] But this is a lot.
[564.72] This is nothing in comparison to
the great news you’ve given us.
[575.00] I can’t believe that
[577.00] my Nosherwan is going
to become a father.
[587.28] Your Baba Saeein and
I are really happy.
[590.00] Where is he?
[590.92] Let me talk to him.
[591.88] I will congratulate him.
[593.00] Yes, yes, he is here.
[594.16] Talk to him.
[595.44] Amma Saeein wants to talk to you.
[599.28] Greetings Mother.
[601.04] Greetings.
[603.16] May you live long
and stay happy.
[605.28] May you be blessed
with wealth and children.
[607.32] Nosherwan, I am so happy.
[610.00] Ever since Dua told me,
I’ve been over the moon.
[625.12] If your Baba Saeein was well,
[627.72] then I would have flown to you.
[632.44] He has a slight fever.
[639.72] If he is really unwell,
then I will come over.
[642.08] There is nothing to worry about,
[643.76] it is just seasonable fever.
[645.48] Your Baba Saeein has
some important work here,
[648.08] once he finishes it,
[649.12] then we will come
to Karachi ourselves.
[661.12] You just have to take
a lot of care of our daughter-in-law.
[675.16] After so many years,
[677.04] a little guest is about
to arrive at our home.
[683.16] If the mother is happy,
[684.80] it will have a positive
effect on the baby.
[687.36] Amma Saeein, I am getting a call.
[689.04] I will talk to you later.
[690.32] Bye.
[698.72] Yes, Amma Saeein.
[700.56] He got an important call,
that’s why he left.
[704.88] How are my children?
[706.48] I hope they are not
fighting with each other.
[707.80] I hope they are not bothering anyone.
[773.88] It would have been better that
[775.88] Dua had told you everything herself.
[777.52] But, fine, since you’ve gone through
the trouble to call me here,
[783.48] I will tell you everything.
[786.40] Yes, I did come to
your house yesterday.
[790.16] I came at Dua's request.
She called me.
[792.40] Now, if you want to know
what we talked about there,
[794.60] then the summary for it is that
[797.36] we had an incomplete love
[799.88] and we want to complete it.
[805.56] But, tell me,
[807.04] who do I need to congratulate?
[808.72] You,
[810.96] Nosherwan Saeein, or Sarfaraz?
[815.16] What nonsense is this?
[816.84] I am talking nonsense?
[819.20] He was saying that…
[820.52] What was he saying?
[822.04] Dua,
[824.76] I had heard both of you talk.
[893.28] Is Jaffar here?
[895.24] No. Mr. Jaffar didn’t come.
[898.00] Okay.
[899.16] Even his number is off.
[900.52] Yes.
[901.16] I don’t know Madam.
[904.00] Okay. Fine. Go.
[905.32] Sure.
[918.92] What happened?
[920.40] Is Saeein not answering your phone?
[925.72] Why are you bothering me?
[929.40] I am bothering you?
[932.36] You are the one who is bothering me.
[939.56] You are thinking of giving
an heir to Nosherwan Saeein,
[946.60] and you are saying that
[948.24] I am bothering you. Huh?
[951.88] Are you envious?
[952.88] Well,
[954.44] it's only natural for
me to feel envious.
[960.80] You are giving Nosherwan Saeein the happiness
that I should have given him.
[970.20] I will feel envious.
[973.60] If you continue to envy like this,
[976.52] then you will continue
to envy all your life.
[980.44] By the way, I am not that envious,
[983.28] because there’s also a bit of peace.
[985.84] Aren't you going to ask why?
[991.92] Nosherwan Saeein
[994.52] doesn’t think that this is his child.
[1001.92] I have some reassurance about this.
[1005.80] What do you mean?
[1010.72] Mind what you say.
[1015.44] I should mind what I say?
[1018.32] You know Sarfaraz has admitted
[1021.36] that something has been
going on between you two...
[1026.84] God knows what.
[1028.76] So, this child as well...
[1035.60] what can I even say?
[1037.80] Anyone would think
the same, right?
[1039.60] How many people will you silence?
[1048.08] Your sister?
[1049.56] She's already turned against you,
hasn't she?
[1056.80] Your family,
[1058.80] Sarfaraz, me,
[1062.04] or Nosherwan Saeein?
[1068.56] The truth is, Dua,
[1072.52] you can't silence anyone.
[1075.44] Hmm,
[1090.08] Hey,
[1091.40] I was just giving you some advice.
[1094.32] Why are you getting upset?
[1099.68] Why would I be envious?
[1160.64] I have been calling
you since morning,
[1162.52] but you didn’t respond.
[1164.84] I was busy.
[1167.28] Fine, I understand
you were busy, but
[1168.88] when Amma Saeein
called in the morning,
[1171.48] why did you leave in the middle?
[1177.20] What was the need to inform
the people at the mansion?
[1183.16] Were we supposed to
hide this from them?
[1185.16] I would have told them myself.
[1189.60] What was the need
for you to announce it?
[1193.20] I didn’t say anything wrong.
[1200.08] I just told them what was their right.
[1204.60] Why are you getting upset with me?
[1214.44] I have just told Amma Saeein that
[1216.48] she will be a grandmother and
[1217.76] she was really happy.
[1220.32] Then why are you getting upset?
[1222.32] Because this is something
to be upset about.
[1232.24] How can I make someone the part of
the happiness that I have not felt myself?
[1238.36] What are you saying?
I don’t understand.
[1241.68] You will understand everything.
[1244.76] You will understand everything.
[1256.80] Why did you call?
[1258.52] I thought you would be really happy.
[1260.84] I have called to congratulate you,
[1263.28] but you are really angry.
[1264.88] I don’t want any
congratulations from you.
[1267.88] Okay, if you don’t want it,
then I will congratulate Dua.
[1275.12] By the way, you have
confirmed from her
[1277.08] who the father of the child is, right?
[1284.96] Ghaznavi, I don’t know…
[1289.76] he is talking nonsense. I…
[1292.64] What nonsense is he speaking?
[1299.28] I don’t know why he was saying all this.
[1302.44] Who else would know?
[1306.24] Why are you asking me this?
[1307.80] Should I ask a third person
about you and Sarfaraz?
[1310.88] Who do I ask?
[1315.24] I have no relationship with him.
[1317.04] Really?
[1319.76] If you have no relationship with him,
[1321.20] then will he speak
this nonsense in front of you?
[1328.24] I will ask you.
[1332.64] Who is the father of this child?
[1334.60] Ghaznavi!
[1422.40] Hmm. Do you want this?
[1423.40] I want this.
[1424.56] Thank you,
[1425.44] Welcome,
[1427.24] Greetings.
[1429.68] Here you go.
[1431.40] Greetings.
[1440.28] Greetings.
[1449.36] Come, have breakfast.
[1467.36] Don’t you get tired?
[1475.32] He is not giving you
any importance, and
[1478.28] yet you keep pursuing him.
[1480.20] Why don’t you stay in your limit?
[1487.40] How do I stay within my limit?
[1489.84] I cannot see you
getting humiliated like this.
[1498.20] I feel sorry.
[1500.12] Hmm.
[1501.12] I don't need your fake sympathy.
[1503.48] Be thankful that
I am sympathizing with you,
[1506.92] even if it is fake.
[1508.08] Okay?
[1509.04] Be thankful.
[1518.60] Give me that.
[1527.12] Have your breakfast. Be quick.
[1631.96] Come.
[1633.28] We wanted to come to your home
to congratulate you.
[1638.08] We changed our mind thinking
Fiza would be left alone at home.
[1642.96] She doesn’t get ready to go anywhere.
[1658.56] No problem. I came over.
[1660.16] You can congratulate me now.
[1663.24] May God grant you
the happiness of having children.
[1672.16] Amen.
[1673.04] Sister, I will name your baby.
[1682.24] Fine. You name them.
[1684.48] Fine. Then I'll start thinking
about it right away.
[1687.36] But should I think of names
for a baby girl or a boy?
[1696.96] Hmmm.
[1697.76] You do one thing,
think about names for both.
[1700.08] Whatever it will be,
the name will be decided by you.
[1702.40] This is absolutely right.
[1716.56] Fiza,
[1721.04] you too come here. Sit with us.
[1728.00] I am fine here.
[1732.32] What have I done, Fiza?
[1743.36] After such great losses of mine,
[1746.56] do you want to receive congratulations
for your happiness from me?
[1761.56] You know,
[1763.24] you are still exactly like before.
[1766.52] Selfish.
[1775.04] Even today, you are only thinking
about your own happiness.
[1777.12] You don't see my pain,
my suffering.
[1791.36] You still want me to
cover up your faults, but
[1795.88] I am no longer the old Fiza
[1804.04] who used to overlook your mistakes
[1807.56] and be concerned for you,
[1811.20] who used to care about you.
[1825.12] You have done so much
with me, after that,
[1828.92] I no longer have
the capacity within me
[1831.80] to be a part of your happiness
[1835.08] or to congratulate you.
[1847.88] Dua...
[1849.60] Child, the juice?
[1852.12] Have some water.
[1866.68] Why did you come here?
[1872.48] What has happened to you?
[1875.48] We are sisters.
[1878.88] Whatever I did,
[1882.56] I did it unknowingly.
[1886.68] Can’t you forgive me?
[1891.68] I have asked you for
forgiveness so many times.
[1893.84] Did I ask you to seek
forgiveness from me?
[1896.60] When I have told you not to talk to me,
[1898.72] then don’t test my patience by
coming in front of me again and again.
[1902.44] I don’t want your apology.
[1904.96] Why are you considering
what Sarfaraz said to be true?
[1908.04] I am your sister
[1909.92] and you don’t trust me?
[1913.64] Fiza, I realize your pain.
[1916.44] Realize?
[1919.16] If you had realized my pain, then
[1921.04] you wouldn’t have done all
[1922.08] that because of which
my life got ruined.
[1926.24] Look at my condition.
[1928.52] Look at your condition.
[1930.52] You live a comfortable life in
a luxurious home despite your sins.
[1936.44] You have a supportive
husband like Ghaznavi
[1940.80] and are about to become a mother.
[1944.00] But me?
[1946.92] You don’t see my condition?
[1950.44] I haven’t committed any sins,
[1951.76] so why am I left desolate?
[1955.40] My child is deprived of a father’s affection
before even coming into this world.
[1961.24] Only because of you, Dua.
[1964.32] And your child?
[1966.32] When he comes into this world,
[1967.88] he will have a father’s affection,
the love of grandparents,
[1971.32] a happy life, everything good.
[1974.52] And what will my child have?
Have you ever thought about it?
[1978.36] The loss I’ve faced
is only because of you, Dua,
[1983.88] and I can never forgive you for it.
[1988.84] I cannot forgive you,
[1990.76] no matter how much I want to.
[1993.76] Don’t come here every day.
[1996.08] Don’t cause me distress.
[1998.20] Just go. Go.
[2000.84] Fiza.
[2036.48] He is not giving you
any importance, and
[2039.44] yet you keep pursuing him.
[2048.48] Go ahead.
[2049.36] I want to meet you right now.
[2051.36] How did you even think
that I would meet you?
[2053.52] I have to meet you.
I want to talk about something important.
[2055.20] And I will only talk when I meet you.
[2057.00] Neither do I want to talk to you,
[2058.52] nor will I meet you.
[2060.92] I am so close to you now.
[2063.16] Won’t you even talk to me now?
[2064.88] Stop the car.
[2069.68] Stop the car on the side.
[2092.16] Go ahead.
[2093.08] What do you want to talk about?
[2094.92] Nothing.
[2095.72] I just wanted to congratulate you.
[2097.28] After all the nonsense you’ve
spoken in front of Ghaznavi,
[2099.32] you still have
the nerve to congratulate me?
[2102.44] Hey, I called to congratulate him.
[2105.72] Now,
[2106.48] he got upset hearing my voice,
[2108.64] I just said something. But,
[2109.72] I didn’t say anything wrong.
[2110.72] Enough.
[2116.20] You have broken off
your relationship with Fiza.
[2122.84] Never come into my path again and
[2124.76] don’t try to have any
connection with me.
[2128.12] Dua.
[2131.64] I want to meet you.
[2133.44] I want to see you.
[2135.12] I want to make you part of my life.
[2136.92] Have you thought about this?
[2139.04] Stop your nonsense.
[2141.36] And in the future neither
follow me nor come in front of me.
[2154.76] Understand one thing,
[2157.92] even if Ghaznavi takes my life,
[2160.96] I will keep on saying that
[2162.24] I have loved you,
[2164.48] and I will always love you.
