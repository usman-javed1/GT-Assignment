[24.77] Mama,
[26.07] I am going to the hospital.
[29.50] Hospital? Is everything fine, child?
[32.13] Yes. Yes. It is just a routine checkup.
[35.40] I have an appointment with the doctor, 
that’s why I am going.
[40.53] So, will you go alone, child? 
I will come along with you.
[43.67] Hey, no, how will you go 
with me in this heat?
[46.87] Rickshaw, taxi, you will get tired.
[52.23] Okay,
[53.53] as you wish.
[59.20] Fiza,
[62.40] you too come with me.
[65.07] I don’t think you are fine.
[69.57] You too get your checkup done.
[71.83] The reason why I had to go 
to the doctor is no longer there,
[80.43] so, it is better that 
you mind your own business.
[85.87] Quietly go to wherever you are going.
[97.40] Bye.
[120.00] Yes, the condition is much better than before.
[122.40] You have improved a lot.
[124.67] I think Mr. Ghaznavi has 
started to care for you.
[129.30] Yes,
[130.87] he always cares for me a lot.
[133.13] If you continue to be cared for like this,
[135.37] then both you and your baby 
will be very healthy.
[139.07] You came alone today, 
didn’t Mr. Ghaznavi accompany you?
[144.00] No,
[145.23] I came alone.
[146.53] Take care of yourself the same way,
[149.70] there will be no complications.
[152.97] Yes, doctor.
[154.20] Okay, these are your medicines,
please take them regularly.
[157.57] Thank you.
[160.03] Thank you, doctor.
[168.20] Dua.
[169.73] What are you doing here?
[171.57] Is everything fine?
[172.87] You have come to the hospital. 
Is everything fine?
[174.90] Mind your own business.
[177.13] All this is happening because of you.
[179.13] Hey, listen to me.
[185.43] Ghaznavi.
[191.73] Ghaznavi, there is nothing like that.
[196.63] Somewhere in my heart, 
I had a thought
[200.73] that you have your checkup today, 
maybe, you will be alone.
[204.63] What if you need me?
[213.80] But coming here, 
I am realizing
[220.20] that I made a really big mistake once again.
[223.90] Whatever you saw is not the truth.
[228.07] Even after seeing everything with 
my own eyes, I was still denying myself.
[238.50] But today, you have proved 
my doubt to be the truth.
[248.53] Please believe me.
[261.77] Ghaznavi, please.
[263.27] Listen to me.
[264.53] Give me one chance to clarify. 
Ghaznavi…
[267.10] Tsk. Tsk.
[272.93] He doesn’t trust you at all.
[279.53] I don’t know how you manage with him.
[285.00] That’s why I am telling you to leave him
and come to me.
[320.07] Ghaznavi?
[339.43] You seem really angry.
[344.37] Did you meet her?
[354.40] For my sake,
[357.00] can you not leave her for some time?
[366.97] Nosherwan,
[374.13] even I am your wife, right?
[383.20] Please drop a few coins of time into 
my lap even if as mercy.
[508.57] Somewhere in my heart,
I had a thought
[512.60] that you have your checkup today,
maybe, you will be alone.
[516.50] What if you need me?
[522.60] But coming here,
I am realizing
[529.10] that I made a really big mistake once again.
[558.60] Yes.
[560.47] How did you remember someone 
as insignificant as me?
[565.67] I think you have started to believe my love.
[573.93] Sarfaraz, can you meet me?
[580.13] Hey, we met yesterday. 
Do you want to meet again?
[582.70] Yes.
[583.87] Can we not meet again?
[588.10] Hey, how is it possible for you 
to ask me and I say no?
[594.70] Hey, what could make me happier 
than the fact that you invited me?
[599.30] We will surely meet tomorrow.
[600.73] Fine,
[601.83] then we will meet today in the evening.
[607.47] Fine,
[608.83] we will meet in the evening.
[610.90] I am sending you the location.
[613.40] Okay.
[626.57] You are going to meet Sarfaraz.
[632.80] This is why Fiza’s home got ruined.
[637.07] Fiza’s doubt was correct.
[639.83] And we kept on trying to make her 
understand thinking that you were right.
[644.77] No.
[646.40] Fiza was absolutely right.
[649.47] She was right when she said an unjust 
cruelty had been done to her.
[654.27] No.
[655.90] And who is the one 
who did injustice to her?
[661.73] Her own blood sister.
[665.10] Hey, I feel ashamed thinking about it,
[668.30] and you didn’t feel ashamed doing it.
[670.63] Mom, you are considering me wrong.
[672.57] There is nothing like that.
[673.70] Stop this drama of yours.
[676.90] You are a liar, you are deceitful.
[686.93] When you have said it yourself 
that there is nothing between you two,
[690.07] then why are you going 
to meet Sarfaraz, huh?
[698.17] Did you not find peace ruining my home?
[700.10] What more do you want to do now?
[704.80] You all are putting me on trial 
without knowing the truth.
[709.43] Stop it.
[710.63] Stop this nonsense of yours,
[712.07] because we won't fall for 
the deception of your words, now.
[717.90] Did you see, Mama?
[718.97] Did you see her actions were 
always like this?
[727.30] No outsider spoiled my home,
[729.43] it was my blood sister.
[738.37] What more will you do now? Huh?
[740.57] Mama, all she will do is bring disgrace 
upon all of us, nothing more.
[746.07] Mama, no.
[747.27] Mama, believe me. Mama.
[779.53] When you called and 
wished to meet me, then,
[783.90] you have no idea how happy I became.
[788.83] When things had gone this far,
[790.90] I felt it was necessary for us to meet.
[793.97] That's why I called you.
[795.60] Yeah,
[796.97] Sumbul's wedding is happening,
[798.90] so I was a bit busy with that.
[802.93] But, when you called, 
I came immediately.
[808.93] Tell me, why did you call me?
[813.77] You…
[816.20] you tell me,
[817.83] what do you want?
[820.03] I called you to find out this.
[824.50] What do I want?
[826.10] I want you to come back 
to my life somehow.
[832.80] Even after knowing that 
I am married to Ghaznavi,
[837.27] and I am going to be 
the mother of his child?
[840.83] I know, and I can wait.
[845.60] If you can wait, then fine.
[851.70] I will marry you after getting 
a divorce from Ghaznavi.
[856.50] Really?
[859.67] Am I dreaming?
[866.17] And you agreed so easily.
[870.03] Well,
[871.57] when I have no place in Ghaznavi's life,
[876.43] I had to come to you, right?
[882.13] You are right.
[885.07] That’s how it is.
[917.80] Did you meet him?
[920.33] Yes.
[923.53] Why did you go?
[927.33] I had some work.
[929.13] What work did you want from him?
[933.93] Fiza, he has divorced you.
[936.77] You are no longer his wife.
[942.23] Whether I meet Sarfaraz 
or someone else,
[950.00] what problem do you have?
[951.53] Yes, I have a problem, 
that’s why I am asking you.
[954.23] Neither is he your husband 
nor are you his wife.
[958.03] You ruined my life on purpose, right?
[967.03] I consider you to be my own, but you 
turned out to be a snake in the sleeve.
[974.63] Even a witch leaves seven homes 
behind before devouring children,
[978.20] and you robbed your own sister's house!
[984.00] You will never be happy.
[985.70] You have ruined my home, 
you will never live in peace either.
[988.07] God will do justice.
[990.77] You will never be able 
to live happily. Leave me…
[1002.43] Mama, she didn’t do good.
[1004.87] She will regret it.
[1006.37] God will do justice to her.
[1008.00] She will never remain in peace, 
the same way she ruined my home, Mama.
[1011.50] Mama, even she will never remain at peace.
[1052.07] Sania,
[1053.67] please make me a cup of tea.
[1087.90] Mama,
[1092.40] can I have some breakfast?
[1101.87] Mama…
[1102.63] It is better that you don’t talk to me.
[1186.53] Why is she in this home?
[1188.50] Why don’t you drag her out of here?
[1191.17] When her character has been 
revealed to all of you,
[1194.00] then how can you give her 
a place to stay in this home?
[1196.17] Drag her out.
[1201.70] She got a husband like Ghaznavi.
[1203.93] She didn’t even value him.
[1208.00] Fine, it is good. 
It is good he divorces her.
[1210.57] But, when he divorces her, 
I am telling you both,
[1213.60] she will never live here, 
and if she stays in this home, Mama,
[1216.43] then I will not stay here. 
I cannot tolerate her face now.
[1219.33] Be quiet, Fiza.
[1228.37] Stop it.
[1229.70] We will make her understand.
[1230.77] No,
[1232.07] you will make her understand right now.
[1233.60] Talk to her and drag her out of here.
[1239.73] Because she has made a 
mockery of life for far too long.
[1242.37] She finds peace in 
our pain and suffering.
[1320.43] It is my henna function too,
[1322.77] but because of your stubbornness, 
it's happening on such a small scale.
[1327.33] You have murdered my happiness.
[1329.93] Who did you make all these preparations for?
[1335.10] For me, right?
[1340.73] Then why is there a need 
to show it to anyone else?
[1355.53] Come on, we will do the ceremony. 
Come on.
[1359.23] -Come, sister.
-Come on.
[1362.20] Come, child, sit there.
[1363.67] Come, sit.
[1452.30] Mama,
[1455.47] do you too consider me wrong?
[1460.03] Don't you have faith in your upbringing?
[1464.80] Not just me, everyone considers you wrong.
[1469.93] It doesn’t matter to me 
what everyone else thinks.
[1476.57] I just want to know 
what my mother thinks about me.
[1486.37] Your mother always had 
a good opinion of you.
[1495.87] You have proven me wrong.
[1503.80] You set fire to your own sister's home
[1507.63] and shattered my trust.
[1516.20] I'm starting to regret my upbringing.
[1522.67] How much more do we tolerate?
[1526.93] Don't give me more pain,
[1535.83] to the point where I start to think
[1539.07] that giving birth to you was a sin.
[1551.73] In fact, don't address me at all.
[1559.77] Don't call me 'Mama'.
[1564.33] I will never forgive you, 
for all the pain you've caused me.
[1620.20] What happened?
[1621.30] Did things work out? 
Did Dua come?
[1625.20] Yes, Dua came.
[1629.67] What did you talk to her about?
[1631.53] She agrees to marry me.
[1638.77] But, she has asked for some time.
[1641.83] She says once the child is born, 
she will leave Ghaznavi,
[1646.00] she will divorce him, 
and marry me.
[1648.37] Did you record anything?
[1650.53] Some voice recording? 
Some evidence?
[1654.33] Recording.
[1656.73] No, I didn’t record anything.
[1658.73] Are you an idiot?
[1660.80] You didn’t record something so big, 
so important.
[1667.87] If there was evidence, I would have 
made Nosherwan listen to it.
[1671.43] Yes,
[1673.07] sorry, I had no idea 
why she had called me.
[1677.73] It slipped my mind, 
I should have recorded it.
[1680.40] I will be careful in the future.
[1682.07] Next time, speak with a little more sense. Okay?
[1685.77] I’m not going to keep explaining 
every little thing like you're a child.
[1691.83] I don’t have the time to waste working 
with foolish, useless people.
[1699.23] We’ll talk later.
[1709.93] She is not even paying me, 
and then she is ordering me around.
[1718.83] He spoiled my entire mood.
[1746.90] Come on.
[1748.17] Bring it. Yes.
[1750.37] Did you serve everything?
Fine, I will dish it out, you go…
[1752.90] No, I am not hungry, take it away.
[1764.47] Nosherwan, you're sitting here 
burdened with worries,
[1768.33] while Dua is out there meeting Sarfaraz
[1773.43] and planning to marry him.
[1780.57] She has no regard for your honor.
[1787.30] Before she humiliates you in court,
[1791.10] divorce her and be done with it.
[1798.27] I don’t want someone to degrade you.
[1803.47] Who gives you all this information?
[1817.33] I keep an eye on her.
[1822.30] I don't want any more harm to come to you.
[1828.67] We have to keep an eye on things.
[1830.70] I can look after what is good 
or bad for me, myself.
[1833.90] You don't need to worry about me.
[1840.67] Okay.
[1843.30] As you see fit.
[1846.07] Have food.
[1847.30] No, I am not hungry, take it away.
[1850.97] And in the future, you will not do 
anything against my will.
[1858.03] Leave from here.
[1973.83] Everyone says that 
she has cheated on me.
[1978.03] She is unfaithful.
[1982.60] Your reports also say that 
she is meeting with Sarfaraz.
[1997.50] But, I don’t know why 
my heart doesn’t accept it.
[2003.00] What do you think?
[2007.07] Can she ever cheat me?
[2011.83] What can I say about this, Sir?
[2020.63] You can think better.
[2027.60] Jaffar, she has never seemed a sinner to me.
[2035.27] My heart doesn’t accept that 
she can ever give me poison.
[2043.60] No matter what happens,
[2047.93] she cannot take my life.
[2055.37] She can never take it.
[2058.10] Sir,
[2060.23] if you think that 
she is not unfaithful,
[2065.00] then who knows,
[2067.53] maybe your heart is testifying the truth.
[2092.67] Papa, did you call me?
[2094.27] Yes, I called you.
[2097.50] What is it that I hear?
[2100.87] I don’t know what information 
has been given to you.
[2104.03] Did you go to meet Sarfaraz?
[2108.37] Yes, I did.
[2113.27] What do you want to prove, child? Huh?
[2116.37] Do you want to prove what the entire world
is saying about you to be true?
[2129.17] Your sister,
[2130.60] Nosherwan, Sarfaraz,
[2133.07] everyone is talking against you. Is it true?
[2137.60] Papa, just because someone accuses me 
doesn't make me guilty.
[2147.63] I did what I thought was right.
[2150.27] Look child, talk openly.
[2152.60] What’s the reason behind meeting another
man while you have a husband?
[2156.90] He was coming in my way again and again,
[2165.70] and then he had said that
[2167.67] he divorced Fiza because of me.
[2174.50] So, it was necessary to ask him 
how much truth is there in it.
[2177.07] Do you see her stubbornness?
[2184.47] She has become so shameless,
[2185.93] that she is admitting in front of you
that she met Sarfaraz.
[2188.20] Fiza, you are in no relationship with him.
[2192.83] So, why are you getting upset 
with me talking about this?
[2202.43] Because our relationship ended 
because of you.
[2205.30] Today, I’m facing this situation 
because of you.
[2209.20] You have not been happy
with him since day one.
[2212.00] His behavior towards you 
was bad since day one,
[2214.47] and then you wanted to get 
a divorce from him, yourself.
[2222.77] If he divorced you,
[2224.53] then why are you getting 
angry with me?
[2230.23] Okay, enough. Enough. Enough. 
Enough. Enough. Enough.
[2237.80] Dua,
[2240.37] you will never meet 
Sarfaraz again after today.
[2247.23] End of story.
[2249.30] I will have an open conversation 
with your husband.
[2254.33] Now, go home. Stay there.
[2262.90] I can’t tolerate these daily dramas anymore.
[2265.07] Leave from here.
[2269.87] Sure.
[2274.00] Instead of dragging her out of the home, 
you are letting her go inside.
[2283.90] I am telling you, Papa,
[2285.23] if she lives here, 
then I will not stay here.
[2287.77] I cannot tolerate her existence now.
