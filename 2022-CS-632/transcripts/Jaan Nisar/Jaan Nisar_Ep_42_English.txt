Fehmida, did you have your breakfast? No, Sania is making it, she is new to house chores that is why she is slow. You have your breakfast,
you have to go to work, I and Sania will do it later. Sumbul got married, and that’s good. It’s a huge deal if girls get
married at the right age. Only Sania is left now. Mr. Aslam, Sania is very young right now
and she is still studying. Yes, but we will also get her
married early, Fehmida. Just when you find a nice proposal
as Sumbul’s in a year or so, get her things finalized too. Hmm, I used to be against
what you said earlier but now that I think of it, what you said seems right. I have gotten very scared because of Dua. Sania’s age is the age
when girls get provoked. Parents shouldn’t give such
a chance to their daughters. Thank God, you understood what I said. Yes, I do. When a girl and a boy are tied in a
relationship with each other at the right time, a person is saved from a lot of problems. Neither girls run away from home nor their parents have to
face such humiliation. It’s better that daughters
get married at the right time. Indeed. The times are very bad, Fehmida, just pray that may God keep the honor of all
the Muslims and all the parents safe. Amen. Amen. Bring the piping hot fried flatbread, my child. Keep it here. First let me eat the first one, and
you already brought the second one, yeah? Your honor, did you have your lunch? I was waiting for you, I was thinking we would have lunch
together when you come home. Hey, no, it wouldn’t be possible for me, actually, a delegation is here, I am also talking to you by taking out
some time from the meeting. If they hadn’t been waiting,
I would have definitely come. Hmm, no problem, you take your time and
attend the meeting, we will have lunch later together. But had you messaged me first,
I might have been able to manage. Hey, what happened? It’s just lunch and by the way, we will have dinner together anyway, right? We will have lunch together tomorrow but then do not schedule any meeting. Your wish is my command, sir. Okay, tell me, did you eat something or not? Yes, I had snacks an hour ago but you have your lunch, in fact, I will ask the chef myself, and he will serve your lunch in the room. Hey, what’s the need? I will ask him. Hey, you are the only owner of my love, I have to take care of you. I will ask him. if that satisfies you then do that. Okay, I will call you after the meeting. Then let’s plan to go out somewhere. Okay. I love you. Hmm? I love you. Bye. I have to work hard to get rich, come on, son, Sarfaraz, when you have had the courage till here, you will have it ahead as well. Yes, who do you want to meet? What should I say?
I don’t even know the name. I am shooting an arrow in the dark,
I will have to say something, I have to think of something. Say it? I want to meet Madam,
tell her Sarfaraz is here. Why do you want to meet her?
What do you want? I will tell that to her only. Wait. Hello? Greetings, madam, some mister wants to meet you. Who is it? And what’s the purpose of the meeting? Madam, he didn’t tell the purpose,
he is saying I will tell the purpose to Madam only. Did he tell his name? What did you say your name was? Sarfaraz. Madam, it is some Mr. Sarfaraz. Yes, madam, what should I say to him? Tell him I am busy and I can’t meet. Okay, fine. Okay, bye. Madam is busy she can’t meet you. Ask her to just meet me for 10 minutes. What did I say?
Madam is busy. Go away from here and listen,
don’t ring the bell again now. Go away. Come on, come on. Why did he come here? Did Fiza or anyone else
tell him about me? What if Ghaznavi and
others come to know that Sarfaraz is that person and who is now Fiza’s husband
and my brother-in-law? Get me a cup of tea. -Did you add sugar?
-Yes, sir. Oh, dude! Where did you go in the lunch break? I went for some work. What happened,
your mood seems off. My mood is off that is why it seems off. Is everything okay?
Tell me what happened. I guess you don’t trust me yet. You didn’t even tell me what happened
in the room the other day, the day Mr. Ghaznavi gave you
a notice for throwing the cheque, I thought you lost your job, or you would leave the job. You think I will leave this job myself? If I leave the job
who will break his ego? Ssshh, speak slowly, 
there are a lot of boss’ spies here. The camera might be observing us too. You can be scared if you want to, I just came back from his house. Whose house? Boss? But where did you get his address from? What do you think? Is it difficult to find out the addresses
of these rich people? The actual information
that I need is about his wife, that who is she? But she has also played
a different game with me, she said I am busy, I couldn’t meet her. What if the boss had seen you? What do you think, am I a kid? Boss and his lickspittle, Jaffar, they were in the office only,
that is why I went to his home. Listen, I don’t think anything
like that has happened, you are just saying all this to impress me. And you think I need to impress you? Okay, wait, even if I accept that you went there and had she come in front of you,
what would you do then? The actual game would have
started from there. I would have gone to him and said, look, my mother is not well,
my sister is a widow, the boss is firing me from my job,
and only you can save me. So, I have come here with
a commendation to you, but the boss shouldn’t know 
I came to you. And she would have listened to you? Yes, what’s the big deal in it? I can even melt a stone with my words, this is nothing. Okay, then? Then what? We would have started to talk from there and things would have led to a date and then everything would be mine. These rich people have a slight problem, they are rich but they are also a bit of
a fool along with that, they put everything in the name of their
wives to save themselves from income tax. Now when the wife is mine, the money becomes mine too. Brother, you have done PHD in fraud. How intelligent you are, 
I must admit. Whatever it is, if I had just met his wife today once, I would have found out 
if she is beautiful or would I have to memorize
a few forceful poetries for her. You are such a moron. That I am. When you are done with ironing, take this vegetable and cook it. You will learn to cook gradually. We also have to get you married
in the near future. Aren’t you guys too worried
about my marriage these days? It’s appropriate for young girls
to get married at the right time. I heard the conversation
between you and Dad. You guys want to get me married, right? Do you have any objection? No, even if I did have an objection,
it’s over after listening to you guys talk. Stay blessed. Parents always want good for their children. Just be careful about the fact the boy is good and rich
while you look for the proposal. How did you think of this? Why shouldn’t I, Mom? Am I not watching both
my sisters living their lives? Brother Sarfaraz does not
value Sister at all. He doesn’t have wealth, but the arrogance, it never ends. On the other hand,
look at Brother Nosherwan, he is also rich and he loves Sister crazily. My child, it’s all about fate. Dua had all of this in her fate. If that’s how it is then Mom,
I pray that my fate is not like Sister Fiza but sister Dua instead. I am sorry
I couldn’t come for lunch today, I was very busy. Thank you. Greetings, Mom. When? Why didn’t you inform me? Yes, I am coming. Yes, I will leave in a bit. Bye. Is everything okay? Hmm? Baba Saeein is not well, he was hospitalized for a couple of days and,
now, he has come back home after insisting a lot. These guys didn’t even tell me. Don’t you worry, everything will be fine. Okay, I am going to the mansion, you go to your mother’s house. You will feel better.
What will you do here alone? Hey, Baba Saeein is not well, what will I do at Mom’s house? I will also come along with you. I will also get a chance to
take care of Baba Saeein. Okay, let’s go. Let me go change first. Okay. Yes, Jaffar, get the cars out. Greetings. Greetings. Stay blessed. Greetings, Baba Saeein,
what happened? -I am fine, son.
-Why didn’t you inform me? You would have been
worried for no reason. I am fine, I am fine. I think, you must allow me, I shall leave now and I will complete the papers of
your will in a couple of days and will come to you again. If life gives me a chance, we will meet again. Yeah, sure, sure. Bye. Baba Saeein, what is the need for will? Zawaar is no longer alive, you have to take care of everyone after me. Kashmala is here, then there are kids and Amma Saeein. I hope you will take very good care of them. My child, I don’t want to put a lot of burden
on you before I leave. That is why I called the lawyer, I want to give their shares to them and leave peacefully. Baba Saeein nothing will happen to you, you have to look after all this. What are you saying? It’s my age now. You are not that old yet. Amma, tell him, what is he saying? What should I tell? Baba Saeein, may God always keep
your shadow over us, you have to live for very long. Stay blessed, my child, stay blessed. The daughter-in-law has come
to the mansion for the first time, is that how we will welcome her? I didn’t notice because
I was worried for you. I am not your daughter-in-law, I am your daughter. So, don’t worry, nothing will happen to you. I have been praying for you
throughout the way. You go and listen to them now, that is why I was telling you
not to get her married right now. What would have I done
if not gotten her married? Khizer is talking about taking out Sumbul
for dinner as her husband, what if they weren’t married and
meeting somewhere behind our backs, would that be better, or taking her out
after marriage is better? No, for me, 
both of the things are wrong and if you got her married, you should have sent her with him as well. Hey, Khizer has asked me for time, he has his unmarried elder sisters at home, would it look nice if he takes his wife
from here while they are still there? Oh okay? He doesn’t think of his elder sisters now when he has been having lunches and
dinners after the marriage ceremony. Hey I allowed him because as a husband
it was the first time he asked for my permission though I didn’t find it appropriate as well. Okay, so end of story then. He is a man, no one will talk about him but you have a daughter. What will people see when she is seen
roaming around with him outside? Won’t they talk about her? Son, he is her husband. I will have to listen to him once or twice, I will have to give him permission but it’s fine, if he asks for my permission next time,
I will refuse. You don’t have to shout so much. You don’t have to shout. Mom, did you see how much
freedom he has given her? I see it, he said he would refuse, don’t make so much noise now. Oh, so I am making noise? Okay, you must give freedom
to your daughter but let me tell you, when you guys will be regretting here
holding your heads and crying, then I will ask you guys. Yes, we will cry, now you may go,
you have given me a headache. Are you listening to our conversations
standing over here? You will stay tonight, right? Yes, Baba, Saeein, for sure. We are here till you are completely well. Stay blessed, my child, stay blessed. Baba Saeein, you shouldn’t have
discharged yourself from the hospital, you don’t seem well to me. Hey, son, one can even die at the hospital, if you are to stay alive, nothing can happen to you
at home as well. Why do you worry us all
by talking like this? Okay, you don’t worry, don’t worry, I won’t die that soon. Madam, both kids were insisting
to come to Baba Saeein. Let them come, let my kids come to me. Baba Saeein, they will irritate you so I asked them not to come here. You may go. -Hey, my kids.
-What happened to you? My love, nothing happened to me,
I am absolutely fine. If you are absolutely fine,
then come play football with me, come. Mizna cheats, anyway. You are a cheater yourself. No, son, don’t say like that. How are you? I am fine, uncle, how are you? I am well. Okay, both of you greeted Uncle,
but didn’t you see Aunt has come along too? Greet her. Greetings, aunt. Greetings. Greetings. How is she our Aunt? Mom says that Uncle is our dad so Dad’s wife would be Mom Jr, right? What happened?
Did I say something wrong? No. Is Sumbul ready? Yes, yes, I will call her. -Okay.
-You have a seat first. So sister-in-law, how are you? I am well. How are you? You must also ask about
the well-being of men. I will ask the men
when they come in front. What are you doing here? Go call her. Okay. Will you have something? Sister-in-law, just water. Listen, they are going out for food, they can have it over there. Go, bring her. I will bring her. Sit down. Why are you looking at me like that? I am looking at the fact that my sister-in-law
has started to glow after getting married. Okay, lock this. Make your Khizer do this now, I have a lot of work of myself. Sister-in-law? Hey? You are blushing and turning red. Okay, come, let’s go,
Khizer is here. He is here? He hasn’t just come, he has been desperately waiting for you. Come. Do I look okay? You look very beautiful. Khizer won’t be able to stop looking
at you if he sees you for once. Come on, let’s go. Look, Dad has allowed you
to take her today but consider it to be the first and last time
that he has allowed you. Whatever I would want to say,
I will directly talk to Uncle regarding this. At least, to understand him
or make him understand, I wouldn’t have to work very hard. I will come straight to the point
and say it in simpler words, you must shut up while talking to me. Look, no matter what you say but you will have to talk to me. And write this down, you won’t get permission next time. Why? Where is it written on my face
that I am a goon? Look, you cannot hide the reality
by wearing a police uniform? What are you trying to say? Okay, look, if you want to hear it, then hear it, you think we trust you because
we allowed you to take her out to eat and to let you come home?
Then that’s not how it is. I guess you are forgetting that
your sister is now my wife. Yes, but that doesn’t mean we trust you. You are insulting me. So then tolerate it, that poor girl is innocent what does
she know of the situation today? People get married,
they get engaged and a lot is happening behind it. And we don’t trust at all that you might not take her with you tomorrow
and just come and say that this marriage is not happening,
what will we do then? What kind of a person are you? Aren’t you ashamed of saying
such pathetic things regarding your sister? You must be ashamed, you think we are fools? You want to make her the limelight
of hotels in the name of dinner, right? Shut up! I have been listening to your
trash talk for very long now. Look, your brother is talking about
such pathetic things, he is such a pathetic man. -Who are you calling pathetic?
-Khizer? Stop! Khizer? Control your brother and hats off to you,
in fact, I salute you that you are bearing this animal-like man. You are so hurt for her, right? Then take her with you.
