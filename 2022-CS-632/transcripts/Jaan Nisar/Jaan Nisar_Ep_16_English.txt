You do remember that you have 
promised me to get me out of here, right? I remember everything, I am just looking for 
an appropriate chance. By the way, tell me, where would you go 
after getting out of here? I mean, will your family accept you? I don’t know, I haven’t thought of it yet. Hmm, if you haven't thought about it, 
start thinking about it already, I am afraid that after 
getting out of this hell, another hell might be waiting 
for you outside, and you might not find a Rumi 
to save you there. Okay tell me something, when you can get me out of here, didn’t you ever think of 
getting out of here yourself? You, why are you here? Why didn’t you run away from here? Even, I was very enthusiastic to 
get out of here like you before, I used to think that a new world would also be waiting 
for me when I got out of here and one day, I even looked for 
a chance and ran out of here. Then, why did you come back? Did Zunaira find you? No, I came back myself. Why? I went straight to my family 
after getting out of here, I cried and told them all the events
 that happened to me. I told them how I was used and 
thrown on Zunaira’s door. But then you know 
what happened to me? After listening to my story, my family disowned me, they felt if my ill-fortunate steps
 got into their house, my other sisters would be 
considered like me as well. That’s it, the doors of my house were closed on me. Hunger, empty road, and wolves that were present in places started to scare me 
in the darkness of the night, and then I thought of 
Zunaira’s luxurious mansion, Zunaira wanted the same from me, and in return, I got this luxury lifestyle, it wasn’t a bad deal for me. And then I decided I would never go back
 anywhere again and came here. You have decided to get out of here, have you thought about 
where would you go? If you take one more step across this door,
I will bury you alive. For God’s sake, 
let her come in. Get out of here. 
Dad, let me come in, I will tell you, Mom,
it wasn’t my fault. Move back! Move, there is no place for a characterless girl 
like you in this house. Fiza? 
Yes? Don’t you want to get ready 
to go to school? Umm, I was thinking that… Hey, why would she get ready for school? She is not at the age 
to go to school now. Hey, I am not asking her 
to go to school to study, she used to teach in a school. Did you call the school? Umm, no, I don’t have a phone. 
Hmm. So, I was thinking that I will go to meet madam today and will tell her that 
I am joining from tomorrow. You have made an absolutely
 right decision, Sarfaraz will take you to school 
after breakfast, okay? What are you guys talking about?
I didn’t get it. What is there to not understand? Our Fiza used to teach 
at the school before marriage, so, she asked me yesterday that 
she wants to join school again. So, I said, we are not 
the kind of parents-in-law, who would suppress the wishes
of our daughter-in-law or won’t understand her happiness, right? So, I immediately allowed her, I told her, no, my child, 
do whatever you feel like, you have my permission. Right, my child? You want to start working again, right? You want to go to school, 
right? Say it. Say it. Yes, I wanted to join my job again. My child, I thought it would be better 
if you spent more time at home but okay if you wish to go and teach, I wouldn’t refuse. What are you saying about 
spending time at home, once she comes back from the job,
she will spend time at home, where else would she spend time then? Hmm, okay. Whatever makes Fiza happy. Umm, Mr. Sarfaraz, Fiza will join the school from tomorrow, she will get back into a routine, I think you must start earning too, hmm? When we fixed your marriage, we told them our son has 
a business of his own, so I think you must get serious now. Yes, I am serious, I have forwarded my CV to a few places, so, I will get a response from there. My son is very talented. He will prove to be talented 
once he gets a job. Look, there are a lot of people 
who give interviews, but only the talented ones get the job. So, do you have doubts 
about my son’s talent? Do one thing, once Fiza’s school work is done, drop her off and come to the shop. Until you get a job, it would be better if you give 
some time to the shop. Okay? Do you see this? Do you see how is behaving with me? Forget about him, once you get a job, 
he will get quiet himself, and because his bread-earning 
daughter-in-law is in front of him, he will obviously do the comparison. Why are you sitting here and eating? Go get ready. I am not your father’s servant that 
I will stand in the heat there outside. I will eat this later. 
I will quickly go get ready. Go. You guys are not doing right
 with sister-in-law. Now I will hear things from her now. You shut up, his father has already made him angry by 
mocking him about the job early in the morning and you are being fuel to the fire. And we are not committing any sin
by asking her to go for a job, hmm? When they are at their parents’ house and are earning and providing for them, nothing happens to them at that time. As soon as the in-laws ask them
to go do a job, they just die. Hmph! Go check if she is ready, you are getting late. 
I am not going. Greetings, Sir Jr. Greetings. Jaffar, give me the news I am waiting for. Sir, she was Zunaira’s girl. I just want to know about Dua. Sir, we are all very aware of Zunaira’s name 
and the work that she does. Hmm. How did Dua get to Zunaira? You said that… 
Yes, I did. Dua met Zunaira after being
thrown out of his father’s house and Zunaira tried to use her
to her advantage but Dua is still reproaching. Hmm. Fix my meeting with Zunaira. Will you go there? Yes, why? What happened? No, Sir, I mean, that place is not 
according to your standards. I know. But do as I say, Jaffar. Go. Sir, think once again. I have thought it through 
and then decided. If Sir Sr gets to know about this news, you will have to face his anger. Who will tell him? You? No, Sir. Shoot me the day you get 
suspicious about me. Just do what I told you. Okay, Sir, I will do it. Would evening be fine? Hmm. As you say. Sumbul? Sumbul, I will just be back in a while, then I will help you in the kitchen
for lunch once I come back. There is no need to worry 
about the kitchen, I and Mom will take care of it. Mmhmm, I am just going 
to a meeting with Madam, I have to join from tomorrow 
so I will be back soon. You are going out with brother 
for the first time, right? Take your time, there is no need 
to come early. Sorry sister-in-law, do you know, 
brother wasn’t like this, he was very, very nice, he used to laugh, make us laugh, I don’t know what happened to him. When he scolds you, I don’t like it at all. I, I don’t have any complaints 
from your brother. You are very nice, sister-in-law. You too. Now quickly go, 
otherwise you will be late. Yes, yes. Bye, bye. 
Bye. Shall we go? What is this? 
Will you go wearing this? What happened to my appearance? These are my new clothes, 
I took them out yesterday. I am not talking about clothes, I am talking about the veil, 
will you go like this with me? I always wear a veil 
when going out of the house. Your sister used to go. Who said that to you? I also have ears and eyes, I also have people who can tell me. I heard she used to go 
to the university without a veil. They lie, if she had ever left the house 
without a veil, Dad would have killed her. Okay, she was the one with 
a veil who left, now move on in life. I am getting late, shall we go? Why don’t you do one thing? Go by a bus or a rickshaw. I don’t know the routes here, and I don’t even have 
the money for the fare, I don’t have anything. What is this suffering I am stuck into? I am taking you one last time, from tomorrow, 
make arrangements for yourself. Mr. Scholar, you called me? 
Is everything okay? Where are you these days, Mr. Aslam? I haven’t even seen you in the mosque. It is just like this, Mr. Scholar. You have become distant from the mosque
 on purpose because of people, right? Just consider it that, Mr. Scholar. This is not the right thing. What should I do? 
What should I do, Mr. Scholar? People’s heart-rending words, 
sentences, mocking, I am unable to bear them. This is a not permanent solution, people never stop talking. Yeah. So, will you keep on just walking from
the front of the mosque all your life in the wait? Actually, I am very weak, Mr. Scholar, I am unable to bear 
what people are saying. You didn’t let the girl enter the house. When the girl admitted her mistake
and came back home, you shouldn’t have made her 
homeless despite having a home. She got me humiliated 
in the whole city, I have been hiding till now. How should I keep such a child 
in my home? What happened, Mr. Aslam? If you get a wound on the body, you don’t cut it and separate it 
from your body, you are supposed to 
take good care of it. Your forgiveness could have 
fixed Dua’s life and hereafter, but you made the honor of your home, homeless because of the fear 
of the world and people, that was wrong. She is a very disobedient daughter, 
Mr. Scholar, very disobedient. Look, she didn’t care about 
the honor of her ancestors, she crossed the limit of her house. I cannot keep such a daughter at home, no. We are also disobedient to God, day and night, but He, my God, he never closed the doors 
of his blessings on us. We are so cruel, Mr. Aslam, if our children make a mistake, we kill them in the name of honor, we throw them out of the house. My God has opened the gates of forgiveness
till the day of judgment so who are we? Who are we to close that door? If possible, find your daughter and bring her home, and don’t ruin your honor and your life 
hereafter just for this worldly honor. What I said, think about it thoroughly. Yes, Mr. Scholar, yes. Fiza, glad to see you. Thank you, madam. Literally, I was very worried 
after your marriage about who should we appoint 
in your place, because you are one of the best 
teachers in our school. Thank you so much. We are fortunate. Why don’t you join the classes from today? Once again, thank you, madam. I will join the classes from tomorrow, I just came to meet you today 
and to inform you. As you wish. Please, allow me to leave. Okay. Wow, wow, wow, you could have taken more time, 
there is no rush. Did you meet someone inside? No, it’s not that, 
I just met Samra. Okay, okay, so you sit with Samra,
I will go home. No. Listen I was thinking that 
Mom’s house is nearby, if we could just meet her on our way,
 she would be happy. You do one thing, do this work of making your mom happy 
from tomorrow or the day after, it cannot be done today. Now sit. 
Okay. Greetings. Is there something that 
you are worried about? Mr. Scholar called me, he was asking me why don’t I 
come to the mosque. So, what did you say then? What would I say? Tell me. I just said that people’s words of mocking, the way they look at me, I can’t come to the mosque 
because of this. You closed the doors of 
this house for Dua just because you were helpless
because of fear of people. Yes. For God’s sake, for God’s sake, clear your heart for Dua, forgive her. I can’t sleep all night thinking 
how our daughter must be. That is what the Scholar says too. So then, will you look for her? I am saying that Mr. Scholar 
is saying the same. I didn’t say that I would get up and 
go and look for her right now. Oh God, Oh God, protect my daughter, end her test, and hand her over 
in safe hands, my God. It is a request of this sad mother, my God. Protect my daughter, my God, protect her. You are going out with brother 
for the first time, right? Take your time, there is no need to come early. Watch the route properly, you have to manage commuting from tomorrow,
I won’t come to pick you up every day, do you understand? Mr. Ghaznavi, why did you bother 
to come to my home? You should have just ordered, I would have come to you on my knees. You must have heard the saying, that the thirsty comes to the well himself. Wow, I am honored. I mean we have become fortunate that your thirst brought you 
to Zunaira’s home. Order me, how should I help you? Please, will you have something? 
That’s not needed. I want to meet Dua. Dua? Where did you meet Dua? He was there at brother Qasim’s party. Dua is that kind of a girl, our very special guest 
wants to meet her. Hmm. It will be better than all of this 
if you can call Dua soon. Yes, why not? Rumi, call Dua. Tell her, our very special guest 
wants to meet her. I will call her. Mr. Ghaznavi, please have something. 
No, thank you so much. I just want Dua. Oh. Consider you got her. Since when is Dua here? It has been a while since 
she has been here. She used to go to the university
 till a few days ago, how has it been a while 
since she is here? Do you know Dua? Is she an old acquaintance? That shouldn’t be your concern. Dua? Where are you?
Come fast. Here I am, wearing your favorite dress. Good, now quietly stand here 
and do as I say. Why are you doing my makeover 
just to take me to the lounge? Is someone here? Yes, someone liked you at the party 
and came here for you. Who? I don’t know, I have never seen him here before. And his name was very difficult. What was Zunaira telling? Anyway, I will do your makeover. You are doing wrong to me, you are betraying me. You said you would get me out of here but you are doing my makeover 
and presenting me to someone. What is all this, dua? Think something else 
instead of doubting me. Anyway, I have to do your makeover. Show it to me. Say Aaa. Bashir, go and see where are they. So, here is Dua, who you were desperately waiting for. Sit down. In fact, do one thing, you come and sit next to Mr. Ghaznavi, he has been desperately waiting 
for you for so long. I want to talk to her alone. Will you talk to a girl like this?
Apologize. Sorry ma’am. Alone? Yes, yes, sure, sure, do it. We will go out. Not here. Outside. Outside? 
Jaffar. Okay. I guess this amount will be 
sufficient for a short meeting. Why not? Bashir will go along. He will bring Dua back along, hmm? Apparently, you don’t think 
I am trustworthy. Hey, Mr. Ghaznavi, how can I make such a mistake? I just said it so you don’t have 
to bother dropping her back. I won’t be bothered. Actually, I haven’t yet… Umm, Dua? You go and take care of yourself 
and I completely trust Mr. Ghaznavi, he is famous for keeping 
his promises and words. Hey, get up. Go. Shall we go? Won’t you say something? What should I say? My tongue is kept as a guarantee 
under the cheque given by you. That little amount was 
compensation to meet you, I had no trouble at all giving it. if someone goes far away 
and then comes back, it’s not a small deal. I didn’t understand. Won’t you ask why was I looking for you? The one who has lost her address, why would she care about 
anyone else finding anything? Hmm, it means, you don’t want to ask about me. Okay, I will ask but the condition is that 
you will tell me the truth. And why would I do that? Because I am asking you. Are you threatening me? Will you be threatened by me? I haven’t forgotten our first meeting yet. I might get threatened by you now, there is a huge difference between 
Dua at that time and Dua now. But I have been looking for that 
old Dua and got to you. You got very late. The time will stop itself because I found you. How did you get there and why, I don’t know that and I don’t want to know but if you want to tell me something 
yourself then that’s different. I trusted an ill-bred, I don’t have anything more to tell you. Do you want him to get to 
your knees and apologize? Just tell me his name
and identity once, and after that, you can give him 
whatever punishment you want. No, I don’t want to have any relationship 
with any memory of my past. Am I a part of that too? I don’t know. Do you want to get out of there?
