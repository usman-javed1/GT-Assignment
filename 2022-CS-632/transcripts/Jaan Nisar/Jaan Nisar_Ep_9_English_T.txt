[91.17] Greetings.
[92.10] Greetings.
[93.00] Greetings.
[104.00] I don’t see Sister Dua.
[107.20] Dua has, what do you call it,
[111.27] food poisoning.
[113.50] So,
[114.37] she is resting in her room.
[116.93] Oh God,
[118.30] I hope there is nothing to worry about.
[121.43] No.
[122.57] The doctor gave her
a drip in the afternoon.
[124.90] They asked her to get rest,
so she is resting.
[130.33] You, come on.
[131.77] Okay, may God give
heath to the child.
[135.17] Aunty, can I meet Sister-in-law?
[140.87] Fiza will come on stage
after the marriage.
[144.73] If you want to meet earlier, then
[147.37] go ahead.
[149.93] Yes, Sister Dua is not there either,
[152.97] I miss her too.
[154.23] I will meet her as well.
[155.23] Yes, yes, meet her.
[156.60] Do meet her.
[158.07] She has locked her room.
[161.57] Actually the doctor has said that
[164.23] no one should bother her.
[164.93] Let her rest.
[165.60] She is really unwell.
[167.77] That’s why.
[168.37] You can meet her later.
[169.67] Okay?
[170.73] If you want to meet Fiza, then
[172.97] I will send Sania with you.
[175.03] Sania.
[175.90] Thank you.
[177.17] Let’s go.
[179.53] Let’s go. Come on.
[180.67] Come on.
[181.17] Come on.
[181.67] Come on.
[190.53] You’ve spilled the nail
polish everywhere.
[192.40] You cannot do anything properly.
[203.57] Aunty,
[205.57] what do we do about this girl now?
[207.37] Why?
[208.93] Why do you ask?
[212.83] No need to worry too much,
[215.07] mind your own business.
[217.03] The poor thing is still unconscious.
[219.30] She must have gotten trapped
in someone’s love, like me.
[224.00] Hey, my love, that’s how it is.
[227.23] Someone gets trapped
[229.53] and someone gets out of this trap.
[232.20] Anyway,
[233.00] I am only concerned
about my money.
[234.60] That’s it.
[235.10] Aunty, please,
[236.37] let her go.
[237.37] She seems to be
from a good home.
[238.90] Why?
[239.63] Did the one who left her here,
[240.90] feel pity, that I will feel pity?
[243.10] Get lost from here,
[244.60] no need to sympathize
with her too much.
[247.57] And focus on your work,
[249.23] you focus on talking.
[252.27] She is showing sympathy to her.
[291.73] What happened, Saeein?
[298.20] I have a weird restlessness.
[303.40] I don’t understand anything.
[305.37] Yes, Saeein.
[307.10] Have your medication.
[309.47] Maybe you are restless
because of the pain.
[313.17] I don’t know, man.
[319.63] She is fine, right?
[321.23] Err…
[325.37] right now,
[325.80] your recovery is really important.
[327.97] Answer what you are asked.
[331.70] Is she fine?
[335.17] Yes, Saeein.
[336.70] She is fine.
[344.83] I don’t know why, my heart
is restless for Dua.
[352.57] I feel as though
she is in some trouble.
[358.53] Jaffar, you find out.
[360.53] Saeein, don’t worry about her.
[362.03] When you have given
me her responsibility
[365.00] then you don’t need to worry.
[367.27] My men, have their eyes on her.
[373.33] I will not tolerate any negligence
from you people with regards to Dua.
[379.50] Remember that.
[381.27] Look, you don’t worry.
[383.20] Right now you are not well…
[389.47] Were you two talking
about something important?
[397.23] Nothing special.
[400.77] It is time for his medication.
[401.80] Give it.
[402.47] Jaffar is here to take care of me.
[410.07] You don’t bother.
[412.37] Jaffar give me the medication.
[416.40] You, leave.
[417.63] I will give him the medication.
[419.53] Leave.
[420.43] Sure.
[538.60] Faraz…
[545.90] Faraz.
[550.47] Faraz. Fa…
[561.40] Who are you?
[562.53] I am Reena.
[566.97] Thank you.
[575.27] What is the need for thanks?
[581.00] Nosherwan, if something
had happened to you,
[586.83] then God knows what
I would have done.
[591.73] I wont die so soon.
[593.73] May your enemies die.
[596.83] I want to live a long and
loving life with you.
[604.93] Even I want to live,
[608.83] but with someone else.
[615.70] What are you thinking?
[620.80] Does it hurt?
[626.17] I have been tolerating pain for so long.
[636.30] But, when will you understand?
[675.27] Hey, Sister Fehmida,
[676.50] come here.
[677.87] Yes.
[678.67] Okay tell me,
[679.87] how is Dua?
[681.53] Hey, it is her Sister’s wedding
[682.73] and the lively Daughter
[683.70] is not part of this event.
[684.70] It is not fun at all.
[686.33] She must be with Fiza.
[688.20] I will check on her.
[689.63] You people, sit.
[693.03] Hey,
[694.40] she is constantly making excuses.
[695.90] Did you see just now?
[696.97] I feel something is fishy.
[699.03] When the wedding
procession came,
[700.77] she was making the same
excuses to the groom’s Mother
[702.63] that she is unwell, she is unwell.
[704.70] You are too much.
[705.40] It is possible that she is really unwell.
[707.17] Leave it.
[708.43] Did you not see her face?
[709.40] She was so worried.
[710.80] There is surely something
that she is hiding.
[713.77] Leave it,
[714.57] enjoy the wedding.
[715.73] See, the setup is so good. See.
[717.67] Yes,
[719.20] they put up a really good setup.
[721.03] They have spent a lot of money.
[722.37] The food will be good too.
[725.77] It is my Sister’s wedding.
[729.23] I was going to her.
[733.83] I shouldn’t have come here.
[736.70] I shouldn’t have come here.
[738.70] Go from this place,
[739.97] this place is not worthy of you.
[745.13] Where will I go?
[749.93] I…
[752.10] I trusted him.
[755.57] I loved him and
[758.00] he ruined my life.
[762.00] How will I go home?
[763.50] My parents will kill me.
[766.17] They will bury me alive.
[767.63] Nothing will happen.
[769.50] You tell them everything honestly.
[771.63] They will forgive you.
[773.17] Get up and leave.
[774.37] No. I cannot…
[776.13] Fiza, Daughter of Aslam,
[779.63] your marriage
[780.97] is being arranged with Sarfaraz,
Son of Nazeer Ahmad,
[783.40] with a dowry of two
hundred thousand rupees.
[787.50] Do you accept this marriage?
[794.80] Say yes, child.
[798.37] Yes. I accept.
[867.60] Sarfaraz, Son of Nazeer Ahmad,
[870.73] your marriage is being arranged
with Fiza, Daughter of Aslam,
[873.67] with a dowry of two
hundred thousand rupees.
[877.30] Do you accept this marriage?
[878.63] One minute, Sarfaraz.
[881.77] What happened Sister Kausar?
[885.03] Nazeer.
[886.27] Hey, what happened?
[888.37] Come on, I want to talk to you
about something important.
[891.97] Hey, we can even talk later.
[893.67] Why did you stop the wedding?
[895.23] Come for a moment
[911.90] What is the matter, Kausar?
[912.80] Why did you stop the wedding?
[915.03] Who got two hundred thousand
written as the wedding gift?
[917.93] We had decided fifty
thousand when we left home.
[920.77] Fifty thousand was your suggestion,
[923.43] I didn’t accept it.
[924.93] And in today's times,
[926.10] what can be done with fifty thousand?
[927.73] Come on,
[929.20] tell the maulvi sahib
[930.90] to cut out two hundred thousand
[932.13] and write fifty thousand.
[934.27] I will not do this at all.
[936.97] You are causing issues in
the wedding for no reason, for a few thousands.
[940.77] Be quiet and sit there.
[942.77] Few thousands?
[944.00] It is two hundred thousand.
[945.83] Two hundred thousand.
[948.00] Kausar, I told you
[950.50] quietly go and sit there,
[952.60] and don’t interfere now.
[955.63] Come on,
[956.07] let the wedding take place.
[957.10] Come on.
[971.33] Nothing,
[972.33] I had to talk about
something important.
[973.97] Please, go ahead.
[976.43] Sarfaraz, Son of Nazeer Ahmad,
[978.67] your marriage is being arranged
with Fiza, Daughter of Aslam,
[981.50] with a dowry of two
hundred thousand rupees.
[985.33] Do you accept this marriage?
[986.60] I accept.
[987.27] Do you accept?
[988.50] Yes, I accept.
[989.50] Sign here.
[1027.87] You look really good.
[1033.50] I didn’t know that
I would be so lucky,
[1036.93] that I will get such a pretty bride.
[1083.63] Hey, girl!
[1087.20] Where are you running off to?
[1089.57] To…my home. Home.
[1094.07] Home?
[1096.13] Which home? What sort of home?
[1098.70] The one who had brought you,
[1101.03] he left you and ran away.
[1103.77] From today, this is your home.
[1105.47] Come inside.
[1106.07] No.
[1107.20] Please let me go to my home.
[1108.73] Don’t keep me here, please.
[1110.03] Please, let me go. Please.
[1112.20] Your lover sold you to me and went.
[1118.50] He counted the entire sum and left.
[1123.53] No, you are lying.
[1127.90] I have heard enough of your nonsense.
[1130.57] Hear me out clearly,
[1132.70] he took the full price.
[1135.57] From today, you belong to me.
[1138.00] Faraz cannot do this.
[1139.50] You let me go.
[1140.83] I have to go home.
[1141.73] Mama and Papa must be waiting.
[1142.93] They will scold me a lot.
[1144.93] They will beat me a lot. Please,
[1145.57] let me go.
[1146.63] I don’t want to live here.
[1147.93] Please let me go.
[1149.20] Believe this as soon as possible.
[1154.23] Come on, Reena,
[1155.27] take her inside.
[1156.43] No. No. Please, no. Please,
[1157.97] no. I don’t want to go.
[1158.47] I said take her inside.
[1160.23] I don’t want to go. Please.
[1161.50] Take her inside.
[1163.40] Aunty, run from here,
[1164.50] the police has raided the place.
[1165.40] Quickly run from here.
[1166.33] Hey, you will get raided.
[1167.33] Where are you going?
[1168.47] Hey, stop. You don’t know me.
[1169.57] Come on, check in all the rooms.
[1170.60] No one will go.
[1171.23] I have really high connections.
Check every room.
[1172.47] No one will go.
[1173.23] Hey, we will see your
connections as well,
[1175.00] when you go to the police station.
[1275.80] You don’t worry,
[1277.57] we will care a lot for her.
[1343.13] Yes,
[1343.93] you start writing their contacts
[1345.77] and all of you tell us your
telephone numbers one by one,
[1349.30] so that your families can be informed,
[1351.47] and they are called here.
[1353.20] Everyone start speaking.
[1357.40] Sir, you can do what you want.
[1359.03] I cannot call my family.
[1360.67] I am helpless.
[1369.47] You will have to call your family.
[1372.90] If you want,
[1373.47] you can tell them their name
and address right now,
[1376.47] or else,
[1377.63] if she starts asking you in her style,
[1380.67] then you will find it difficult to tell us.
[1385.77] Will you tell me or should
I slap you again?
[1387.87] Tell me quickly.
[1388.80] What is sir asking you?
[1390.00] Are you having a hard time telling
us the name and number?
[1394.47] Tell us.
[1412.13] Yes, you tell me.
[1414.73] What is your name?
[1418.90] Hey, speak up.
[1423.60] D..
[1425.70] Can you not hear me?
[1430.07] Tell us the name and
address of your family.
[1432.30] Will I have to repeat it
for everyone one by one?
[1434.13] Speak up.
[1435.57] Dua. Dua.
[1440.30] Tell me your father’s
name and phone number.
[1447.80] Sir…
[1450.90] Did you not hear me?
[1453.10] Should I call her?
[1456.00] Please…
[1456.83] I am from a respectable home, please.
[1460.97] I am a really respectable girl, sir.
[1470.40] From a respectable home.
[1472.43] Did all of you hear it?
[1478.50] If you are from
a respectable home, then
[1479.77] what were you doing there?
[1481.50] They all say that they are from
a respectable family after getting caught.
[1484.97] Tell us your father’s name and number.
[1490.67] Hey tell us, speak up.
[1493.77] Hey, will you tell us or not?
[1495.50] Should I call her?
[1514.70] Just think…
[1516.70] think we have sent off two Daughter.
[1519.90] We sent one to her in-laws home,
[1521.53] and we lowered the other to the grave.
[1524.57] Don’t say that.
[1527.73] Dua is our child, our Daughter.
[1531.67] Find her and bring
her from somewhere.
[1533.47] Where do I find her from?
[1535.23] If you know her location,
[1536.27] then give me her address.
[1537.63] I will bring her from her lover’s home.
[1540.30] God damn it, she ruined me.
[1542.97] She dishonored me.
[1544.73] I never imagined even
in my worst nightmares
[1548.23] that I’d have to lie to people
to save her honor, to maintain her illusion.
[1554.60] Oh, check. Check, see,
[1556.70] what if it is Dua.
[1559.13] hello.
[1560.10] Is this Mr. Aslam?
[1561.90] Who is this?
[1563.80] I am the inspector from
the police station.
[1566.67] Police station?
[1567.73] You are calling from
the police station?
[1569.20] What do you want to talk about?
[1572.57] Your Daughter is in our custody.
[1576.23] What is she doing in your custody?
[1580.87] You come to the police station
[1582.03] and hear your Daughter’s adventures.
[1585.73] Hey…
[1586.47] God be kind.
[1588.10] They were calling from
the police station
[1589.53] and what were
they saying about Dua?
[1591.03] Hey, Dua is in the police station.
[1592.77] God knows what she did.
[1595.33] I used to tell you
[1598.03] that Dua is surely in some difficulty.
[1600.43] The same thing happened.
[1601.27] Hey, we will find that out
when I go to the police station,
[1604.00] that she is in trouble
[1605.37] or has she got us into trouble.
[1609.47] Mama, I hope Sister is fine.
[1613.77] Pray.
[1615.53] May God bless her,
may she be fine.
[1618.03] Oh God,
[1619.80] have mercy. My Lord.
[1622.40] Have mercy.
[1633.57] You are such a good
and brave man,
[1638.03] but have no realization
of my emotions, my love.
[1651.13] Why do you run away
from me, Nosherwan?
[1657.67] You were running from me and
[1661.43] fate put you in my arms.
[1667.40] Where will you run to, now?
[1671.97] Now, you will be in
my control for a few days.
[1679.73] You don’t need to worry about me.
[1686.53] Err…
[1687.23] I can still take care of myself.
[1695.30] And the desire to control me,
[1699.87] will always remain
a desire for you.
[1703.87] Nosherwan, I…
[1736.00] Should we not do the custom?
[1737.93] Should we do the sweet custom?
[1739.47] We will feed both of them,
[1740.33] this will be the custom.
[1741.53] Hey girls. Stop it. Stop it.
[1744.87] Enough fun and game.
[1746.93] Now we will have
the custom of seeing the face.
[1749.53] Should I set this?
[1750.60] Although the bride and groom
have already seen each other,
[1753.07] there are still customs
to be done, right?
[1755.30] Yes, absolutely.
[1756.90] Come on, bring the veil. Be quick.
[1758.63] Okay.
[1766.23] Here you go. Here,
[1768.07] look at each other.
[1778.63] Sister-in-law,
[1779.70] look at him carefully.
[1780.87] Don’t complain later.
[1785.37] You saw him carefully, right?
[1788.20] Mr. Aslam, you look
like a decent man,
[1791.03] but your Daughter,
[1792.60] her actions are…
[1798.13] What did she do, inspector?
[1799.77] Huh?
[1801.40] The apartment your
Daughter was arrested from,
[1804.13] there…
[1809.60] Tell me something,
[1810.57] are you acting like
you are unaware
[1813.57] or did you already know all this?
[1821.17] Here you go,
[1822.03] here is the ring.
[1824.03] Whoever finds it, wins.
[1826.50] Okay?
[1827.47] Come on, find it.
[1829.40] Sister-in-law, you have to find it.
[1830.97] You have to keep a hold on Brother.
[1832.97] Wow,
[1834.43] your Sister-in-law just came in this home
[1836.97] and you changed your party.
[1838.23] yes, what else?
[1839.07] Hey, be quick.
[1841.13] Okay.
[1844.43] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
[1846.03] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
[1847.47] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
[1852.40] Hey,
[1852.77] What?
[1853.33] I think I found something.
[1856.60] No, it is not that easy
to find, Brother.
[1859.43] Try. Try.
[1870.40] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
[1872.63] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
[1875.00] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law.
[1890.97] Your Sister-in-law, won.
[1892.50] See. She had to win.
[1914.83] I don’t know where Dua will be.
[1917.60] What condition will my Sister be in?
[1934.13] Should I bring something to eat?
[1946.60] What is this?
[1949.90] Such a light set,
[1951.13] thin like a feather.
[1954.87] We didn’t ask your
Parents for anything,
[1958.10] but they crossed the limit.
[1967.30] Did you just bring this,
[1968.67] or is there something else too?
[1970.93] Huh?
[1973.57] Speak up.
[1976.00] Why don’t you speak?
[1979.33] It is just this.
[1982.40] What was the need for this, even.
[1984.63] They should have just married
off their daughter in one dress.
[1990.87] Your Parents have taken undue
advantage of our decency.
[1999.43] Huh!
[2002.87] Mama.
[2005.53] Hmm?
[2006.23] Papa is calling you.
[2010.57] He cannot do anything without me.
[2013.57] Move.
[2016.23] Sister-in-law,
[2018.23] tea? Coffee? Should
I bring something?
[2021.37] No, thank you.
[2023.20] Okay, don’t worry.
[2025.07] You rest,
[2025.60] Brother will be here soon.
[2027.10] Okay?
[2041.13] You are a decent man,
[2042.30] that’s why I am letting you go.
[2044.33] Had the FIR been filed,
[2045.80] it would have become difficult for me.
[2051.97] Take your Daughter.
[2056.43] Inspector,
[2060.23] she is not my Daughter.
[2065.67] She is not my Daughter.
[2070.93] Are you in your senses?
[2072.53] What are you saying?
[2076.33] I told you,
[2078.10] she is not my Daughter.
[2079.50] Papa. Papa, please,
[2081.00] don’t leave me here.
[2087.60] Papa, I made a mistake.
[2090.40] Forgive me.
[2093.00] All this is not true.
[2095.03] I will tell you everything.
[2096.33] Please, don’t leave me here.
[2097.60] Please, Papa. Please.
[2099.67] Inspector,
[2100.87] she is not my daughter.
[2102.23] Leave my hand.
[2103.07] Papa.
[2103.80] Leave my hand.
[2105.00] Papa. Papa. Papa.
[2107.93] Papa. Papa. Papa, listen to me.
[2110.37] Papa, please. Papa, please,
[2110.97] don’t leave me here.
[2111.97] Papa, please. Please. Please.
[2113.13] Please. Papa, please, please,
[2114.57] don’t leave me here and go.
I will die.
[2116.07] Papa, please.
[2117.47] Your father is dead.
[2122.13] After what I heard today,
[2125.00] even if I had a Daughter,
[2127.63] then she too would have died.
[2130.03] Papa. Papa.
[2146.60] Papa. Papa. Papa.
