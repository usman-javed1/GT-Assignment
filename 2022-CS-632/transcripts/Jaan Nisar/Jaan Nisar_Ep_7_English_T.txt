[38.20] What thought are you lost in?
[40.27] Put in some effort.
[42.70] Massage them properly.
[47.40] I was thinking about something.
[49.37] What are you thinking about?
[54.00] Sister Kausar had come
[55.50] to take measurements 
for Fiza’s bangles and shoes.
[60.23] So,
[61.33] during the conversation,
[62.53] she mentioned that 
she was greedy for dowry.
[68.07] She was saying the same thing 
again and again.
[70.73] Women manage the home economics,
[73.40] what do men have to do with it?
[77.60] What Sister Kausar said 
has worried me.
[80.83] It feels as though,
[81.93] Brother Nazeer spoke about
 not taking the dowry himself.
[86.27] She knows nothing about this.
[88.07] Listen,
[89.27] Brother Nazir said no 
to dowry damning it.
[92.47] He is a good man, 
a decent man.
[94.17] He has said no, that’s it.
[95.40] Now if his woman is being greedy, 
then what do I do?
[97.90] But Mr. Aslam,
[99.57] our daughter has to stay 
at home all day long
[101.93] with her Mother and Sister-in-law.
[104.13] God knows what sort of things they say,
[107.00] and how they taunt our daughter.
[109.47] You women really like worrying.
[113.37] You stay worried yourself,
[115.00] you also have the men worried.
[117.00] You don’t worry,
[117.77] I will talk to Brother Nazir
[118.97] to talk to the women of his home 
about the nonsense they are speaking.
[121.90] No. No. No.
[123.00] You will not talk.
[124.33] You will not talk at all.
[125.83] Hey, Sister Kausar
[128.50] will dislike it for no reason.
[130.37] I will surely talk.
[131.73] They started it.
[132.93] Even if the marriage stops.
[135.73] What are you saying?
[137.73] Why should we stop the wedding?
[138.83] The entire neighborhood 
has found out that
[140.30] it is our daughter’s wedding.
[142.00] God forbid,
[143.20] if the wedding stops again, then
[145.97] people will say all sorts of things.
[150.83] It is possible,
[151.97] I may have had some misunderstanding.
[153.67] I might not have understood 
what she said, properly.
[156.00] Tell me something honestly, Fehmida.
[158.33] Did she say this or did you think of it?
[162.37] I made a mistake. 
I heard wrong.
[173.70] Hey, whose phone is this?
[176.43] Where did you get it from?
[177.97] I just got it. It is really cheap.
[180.80] You cannot take pictures in this.
[184.93] You were strongly against it.
[186.37] You used to call it an instigator.
[188.47] So, what?
[189.53] Have I become an infidel buying it?
[191.13] Huh?
[192.23] I didn’t buy it to have affairs.
[194.37] It is the need of today.
[196.10] Now if the car has been invented
[197.63] then should I go on a horse?
[198.93] Now if I have to talk to people,
[200.27] should I write letters? What do I do?
[201.57] And one more thing,
[203.10] I am noticing Fehmida,
[204.40] you have started to talk 
with a lot of sarcasm.
[206.57] You have started acting really sarcastic.
[208.03] No, there is nothing like that.
[209.93] I saw the phone with you,
[212.37] so I asked.
[215.13] Okay,
[215.90] if we are not giving dowry, then
[217.33] give me some money.
[218.90] I will make a few dresses for Fiza,
[221.57] and we will also have 
to get new clothes for
[224.10] Dua and Sania to wear 
at the wedding.
[226.13] Why?
[227.37] What rules state that
[228.10] it is necessary to wear a 
new dress in the wedding?
[230.77] It is the first happiness of the home,
[232.70] so the girls have desires.
[234.37] I don’t have money for these, tantrums.
[236.33] I am telling you clearly.
[237.80] Tell your daughters
[239.30] to fulfill their desires with 
their husbands after marriage.
[244.50] We will not have any henna functions.
[247.63] These are really cheap functions.
[250.13] Hun
[250.87] Even if the in-laws don’t come, but
[253.27] we will have Fiza sit for 
her henna at our home.
[257.43] The girls wish that
[258.70] the girls from the neighborhood,
[259.83] friends, and all would apply
 turmeric cream to her.
[262.90] The home will become lively, 
what else?
[264.73] Don’t come to get a penny from me.
[266.97] I have no money. Yes.
[269.10] Spend from your own pocket.
[270.33] And one more thing,
[271.33] no need to invite a lot of people.
[273.13] If things get sorted with 
four to five food pots,
[274.30] it is enough.
[275.50] If I could,
[276.20] I would have managed in one pot.
[277.37] But that’s it,
[278.20] don’t invite too many people.
[279.50] And use your hand,
[280.77] do something now.
[282.13] You have driven me mad.
[283.63] Be quick.
[284.67] Let me sleep a little.
[291.80] This one will really good on me, right?
[293.90] Yes,
[294.50] wear it at the wedding, okay?
[295.77] Yes.
[296.37] See, it has so much embroidery.
[299.33] Make me breakfast.
[303.77] It is 2 pm in the afternoon
[305.13] and you want breakfast.
[306.97] Mend your habits,
[308.60] you are going to get married.
[310.27] What habits do I mend?
[312.87] And it is a holiday,
[314.43] so a person will wake up at this time.
[316.63] Are you making breakfast
[317.63] or should I go out and have it?
[318.43] Why are you getting angry?
[319.93] Just give me five minutes,
[320.70] I will bring breakfast.
[323.50] Be quick.
[324.07] Hey, where are you going?
[325.60] Sit. Look at this.
[327.37] I got these dresses made for Fiza.
[329.30] You too have a look and let me know
which one is good.
[332.17] Wow.
[333.53] Mama, I know a lot about them,
[336.10] and I know all this really well.
[338.13] Hey, you got it,
[339.87] you would know better. It is good.
[343.27] Bring the breakfast to the room.
[348.93] Why do I feel Brother doesn’t 
want to get married?
[351.87] No, no,
[352.63] there is nothing like that.
[354.33] He just woke up,
[355.53] that’s why he is out of his mind.
[357.10] You quickly give him breakfast
[358.60] or else he will start screaming again.
[361.10] Oh God,
[362.23] I pray that Fiza comes home soon,
[364.47] and takes care of her tantrums.
[365.87] We are tired.
[366.87] Amen.
[367.80] Amen.
[369.00] I will go give him breakfast.
[451.10] This Sunday is so boring.
[453.83] Why?
[454.57] Yes,
[455.37] you have to clean and mop.
[457.40] You be quiet
[459.43] and focus on your work.
[461.87] All the people of the world, party.
[464.80] They plan dinners.
[466.63] They all do good. And us?
[468.43] We middle-class people
[469.80] wait for Sunday, so that
[471.57] we setup the washing machine 
and wash clothes.
[477.33] Are you going somewhere?
[479.67] Yes, I am going to get the committee.
[481.33] Pray that I get it.
[483.03] Hey,
[483.90] the wedding is around the corner,
[485.77] you should have let Fiza rest.
[487.10] You two should have worked.
[488.57] No, no, these people were telling me not to,
[490.00] I am just busy with work myself.
[492.27] Hey, child, you should rest.
[495.23] We will let her rest.
[496.37] We will make our beloved Fiza rest too.
[498.70] But tell me,
[499.57] when will we go shopping?
[500.60] I have to shop a lot
[502.70] and I will get a pink dress 
for myself at the wedding.
[505.87] She will wear red, right?
[507.47] Yes, sure.
[508.80] We will shop soon.
[511.23] Sania.
[511.90] Yes, Mama.
[512.63] Child, come, close the door.
[515.13] Go. Go, do some work.
[519.77] Bride.
[522.13] By the way, bride,
[523.37] don’t you think this will be the most
unique wedding in the world?
[526.87] Because I still haven’t seen 
the face of my Brother-in-law.
[531.20] Hey, Sumbul came that day,
[532.80] did you not see the picture?
[534.23] No,
[535.13] because she was saying my Brother, 
my Brother, my Brother, so much,
[541.17] that her phone switched off by the time
she tried to show me the picture.
[544.27] Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
[547.10] God will ask you,
[547.70] for what you have done just now.
[549.63] I am going to go hang the clothes.
[550.93] Yes, I am also coming.
[552.13] No. No. No. No.
[553.30] You rest.
[555.07] Did you not hear what Mama said?
[556.77] Make my daughter rest.
[559.00] Hmmm
[559.57] So, my beloved bride,
[560.90] put on turmeric cream and go to sleep.
[562.27] Hey, what is it? I am coming.
[563.63] I will help you.
No, not at all.
[564.77] The work will get done sooner.
[565.50] After all, see, there are so many clothes.
[566.87] Come on.
[574.03] What did you think about Dua?
[575.43] Are you serious about her?
[605.77] Hello.
[606.80] Yes, hello.
[608.13] Are you going to university tomorrow?
[610.57] Yes, why?
[611.53] Fine. We are meeting tomorrow,
[614.17] and I will pick you up from outside.
[618.17] But Faraz, I had told you,
[619.90] give me a chance.
[621.90] I have given you all the chance
 that I could.
[624.73] Now everything is getting 
out of my tolerance.
[627.57] What is getting out of your tolerance?
[630.27] I will tell you when you meet me.
[633.90] But…
[634.57] No, buts,
[636.17] we are meeting tomorrow.
[637.50] That’s it.
[645.80] One minute.
[647.53] Open up, quickly.
[653.60] What?
[654.13] Who were you talking to?
[656.30] Who will I talk to alone in the room?
[658.70] My clothes had gotten wet,
[659.77] so I thought I would change them.
[661.50] Dua, I have heard it with my own ears,
[663.03] you were talking to someone.
[664.37] Me?
[665.10] I was not talking.
[667.30] I was dancing,
[668.33] so I was singing along with it.
[669.27] I locked the door.
[670.40] Had Mama and Papa seen it,
[671.10] they would have scolded me.
[672.23] Why do you do such things
[673.63] that you get scolded by Mama and Papa?
[675.90] They always have an issue with me.
[678.77] Whether I do something or not.
[680.00] What are you doing?
[681.60] I have to wash the sheets.
[682.83] These are the last ones that are left.
[683.60] Please take out new sheets
and keep them.
[685.13] Come on. Come and work.
[687.40] My hands get spoiled.
[702.50] You didn’t call,
[704.03] so God knows what sort of thoughts 
I was getting in my heart.
[707.43] Don’t even think
[708.90] that your Faraz will cheat you.
[716.47] I love you a lot.
[765.13] What is the need to put on this makeup 
for going to the university?
[770.67] It is not makeup, it is a lip balm.
[775.30] Whatever it is.
[777.77] I shouldn’t see you leaving the home
in this dressing in future.
[781.53] Go,
[783.33] wash your face.
[785.40] Why?
[788.03] Because you are not 
going to the university.
[791.67] I am not going to the university?
Reason?
[795.03] I got my committee,
[797.13] we will go to the market for shopping.
[801.07] Mama,
[802.27] shall we go for shopping tomorrow?
[804.23] Why?
[805.53] What is there, today?
[807.60] You were the one who made 
the most noise for shopping.
[811.60] Yes, that’s true. But,
[813.57] I have something really important 
to do at university today.
[816.50] What do you have to do?
[819.30] You forget about going to the university
 till Fiza’s marriage.
[821.97] There are a hundred things 
to do at home.
[824.53] Sania is young and what will I 
continue to do on my own?
[828.03] She is not so young.
[829.77] She always does a lot of work.
[831.17] She always talks, and 
she will do some work. So, what?
[833.00] Mama, please let me go.
[834.53] It is really necessary for me 
to go to the university.
[836.60] I swear. I swear it is really necessary.
[838.00] Look Dua, there is no point in arguing.
[841.33] Let Fiza rest.
[842.83] You come with me.
[843.80] There is a lot of work left in the kitchen.
[845.40] Come and help me out.
[847.37] And clean this makeup of yours,
[849.27] we have to go to the market later on, as well.
[851.27] I am waiting for you. Come on.
[853.43] Cruel mother.
[854.63] At times it feels like 
I am not your daughter.
[857.60] Only Fiza and Sania are your daughters.
[861.27] I look good. What will I say to Faraz?
[864.00] It was really necessary to go today.
[866.40] After today, I will be stuck 
with the wedding.
[914.90] Hello.
[916.00] What is the meaning of saying 
no at the last moment?
[919.53] Hey, if you didn’t want to meet 
then you should have told me earlier.
[921.90] Faraz, why would I not 
want to meet you?
[924.47] I was ready to leave,
[925.77] but Mama stopped me for shopping.
[927.73] Okay stop it, these are 
useless excuses of yours.
[931.67] This is the value of what I say.
[933.30] Hey, no, there is nothing like that.
[934.77] I am telling you.
[936.17] Why would I not want to meet you?
[937.70] You go shopping.
[940.17] Just don’t text me, or call me.
[943.50] Goodbye.
[951.90] He got upset.
[957.30] Dua.
[959.07] Yes. Yes, coming.
[962.83] She thinks this is a joke.
[964.93] I have given her way too much importance.
[968.60] If I don’t talk to her for a few days, 
then her mind will be in the right place.
[982.73] Sister, where did you bring us?
[984.73] Everyone here will look at 
our veil with weird looks
[987.10] and no one is dressed like this, even.
[988.63] I feel it really weird.
[990.03] What is there to feel weird?
Stay confident, okay?
[993.47] Listen, everything here is really expensive.
[996.67] I think this mall is really expensive.
[999.60] We shouldn’t have brought Mom here
[1001.97] Look, something will come in our range,
[1003.97] and if nothing comes in our range,
[1005.80] then we have the neighborhood shop.
 Shall we go?
[1008.63] Hey, where have you brought us?
[1009.93] There is a good shop in front. 
It is a really good shop.
[1011.90] Cheap. Cheap shop.
[1012.87] Come. Come on. 
You people have gone mad.
[1016.97] Look at this.
[1018.17] It is such a beautiful dress.
 See, how does it look?
[1020.67] It is so pretty.
 The color is so beautiful.
[1023.47] Madam, the trial room 
is on this side. Try it.
[1026.27] No, I am just looking.
[1045.77] I will look really pretty wearing this color.
[1048.67] What is its place?
[1050.93] Eighty thousand.
[1054.60] Eighty thousand?
[1056.67] This…
[1065.20] Eighty thousand?
[1066.67] What is so special about it? 
So expensive?
[1071.10] What are you doing, Mama?
[1073.10] Hey, I am checking if this embroidery 
is done with gold wires.
[1078.60] Mama.
[1079.83] Mama, this is the price they sell it 
for in a shop at the mall.
[1083.33] Things are expensive.
[1085.13] Then what was the need 
to come here? Huh?
[1088.40] You wasted my time for 
no reason. let’s go.
[1094.27] Wait, let me see. 
Come on.
[1103.73] I cannot afford it.
[1106.93] Thank you.
[1122.17] Pack this.
[1138.70] No.
[1141.10] Come on. 
What are you doing?
[1143.30] Mama, one minute. 
Let’s have fries.
[1144.90] Which one do you want to have?
[1146.03] Let me get it once. 
Which one? Tell me.
[1148.43] Which are your best fries?
[1150.10] Barbeque, madam. 
Barbeque. Make one barbeque.
[1151.83] Do you want to have barbeque?
I will have barbeque.
[1153.63] She will have barbeque. 
Barbeque. Which one is spicy?
[1155.70] One of these. 
Chili powder.
[1157.43] Stop it. Why?
[1158.70] Come on, Mama. 
You eat it.
[1160.73] One garlic mayo. 
One garlic mayo.
[1162.20] One garlic mayo. 
Garlic mayo.
[1168.57] Give this to Mama. 
Pay him. Pay him.
[1170.60] How much, son?
[1172.00] Six hundred, madam.
[1174.87] Oh God, Mama. 
So much money?
[1177.37] Hey, we could have cooked 
for one time at home.
[1194.73] yes, sir.
[1197.13] Ghulam Sarwar has said that
[1198.97] you have given the order 
to take out the car.
[1201.50] Huh?
[1203.00] Yes.
[1205.40] Where do we have to go?
[1208.30] We are not going, Jaffar. 
Only I am going.
[1211.17] You are going alone?
[1213.60] But where?
[1221.80] I am going to get a glimpse of Dua.
[1224.53] Sir, you know well that 
before you leave,
[1227.30] I have to get the recce 
of the routes done.
[1229.33] Nothing will happen, Jaffar.
[1230.67] No,
[1232.27] I cannot let you go alone.
[1234.20] She lives in the same street,
[1236.10] where there was a commotion last time.
[1238.50] If I go without the protocol, 
nothing will happen.
[1240.80] Sir, I cannot take this risk.
[1244.60] Jaffar.
[1250.10] When I am saying I will go alone, 
so I will go alone.
[1255.30] Fine, sir.
[1257.57] As you wish.
[1296.80] Faraz.
[1298.47] Faraz.
[1300.53] Hey Brother, what is going on here?
[1301.87] What do you want to do?
[1303.40] There you were going crazy in her love
[1305.10] and here you are marrying 
a girl you don’t know.
[1307.80] And your henna function is today?
[1309.27] Man, what do I make you understand?
[1311.53] I don’t understand what I should do.
[1313.90] On one hand, 
I am unable to meet Dua,
[1316.00] I don’t understand how I go 
and talk to Mama and Papa.
[1319.70] You know my condition at home.
[1322.40] They say I am useless, I don’t work,
[1324.70] I don’t earn money.
[1326.33] How will I take her 
in front of them?
[1328.37] Yes, man, you are right. 
Your condition is evident.
[1331.60] But, how can you even 
talk in this situation?
[1333.67] Yes, you are right. But there is a way.
[1336.37] The thing is, let this henna function 
pass somehow today.
[1339.77] Then I will bring her in front of Mama
and say that
[1343.63] she is the one, I want to marry her.
[1346.10] I will fall to Mama’s feet,
[1347.53] then it is between Mama and Papa. 
Mama will surely convince Papa.
[1350.87] I see this as the only way.
[1352.80] Brother, everyone is waiting for you,
[1354.80] what are you doing here? 
Come on.
[1355.83] Come on. Come on. 
Take Brother.
[1549.43] Go ahead, Jaffar.
[1550.53] Yes, sir.
[1553.00] I have been observing you for so long,
[1555.43] that you have not even been able 
to see a glimpse of her.
[1558.53] If you want, 
then should I do something, sir?
[1565.23] Jaffar, you are too much.
[1566.93] Sir, you know well,
[1569.50] I cannot leave you alone, 
even for a minute.
[1576.70] Your loyalty seems like a reward 
for a good deed of mine.
[1584.63] Fine, you do what you want to do.
[1586.97] I too would want to see,
[1590.13] how you can cure my ailment.
[1592.40] Yes, sir.
[1594.17] I will just do it.
[1842.93] Hello.
[1845.27] Are you still upset with your, Dua?
[1850.70] You want to convince me, right?
[1853.17] Yes.
[1854.37] Fine, then meet me tomorrow.
[1856.77] Tomorrow?
[1859.13] Tomorrow is the wedding.
[1861.13] Now I will be able to go the university 
after the wedding.
[1864.43] Dua, see you are doing 
the same thing again.
[1866.23] You are upsetting me.
[1867.77] Okay, why do you get angry?
[1870.50] Fine, then meet me tomorrow.
[1873.40] I want to introduce you to Mama.
[1875.30] Dua, my life is of no use without you.
[1878.80] My family is forcing me to get married,
[1881.73] I cannot wait anymore.
[1884.67] You just meet me tomorrow.
[1886.57] I will introduce you to Mama.
[1888.83] Okay, I will meet you.
I will talk to you at night.
[1892.63] No, we are meeting tomorrow.
[1894.87] Okay.
[1897.13] Fine.
[1899.67] Dress up well and come.
[1969.67] Sir.
[1975.30] The breakfast is getting cold.
[1979.67] Hmmm.
[1988.30] Jaffar,
[1991.33] I want constant updates about Dua.
[1994.77] You will get it, Sir.
[2020.80] They look pretty, right?
[2023.07] Thank you, it is really good.
[2030.10] You did good makeup.
[2035.37] Wow.
[2040.37] How long will it take for her makeup?
[2042.47] It will take her two hours, at least.
[2044.30] Two hours?
[2046.40] So, what will I do sitting here?
[2048.67] I will do one thing, I will go home.
[2050.73] Then, I will come back after 
two hours and get you.
[2052.57] Where are you going? Are you mad?
[2055.97] You know,
[2057.07] how angry Papa will get when 
you go home alone right now.
[2059.43] After all, we got permission to 
come to the parlor with difficulty.
[2063.33] Hey, stay right now. 
Where do you have to go?
[2066.77] The home is two streets away.
[2068.47] I will go with some child, man.
[2071.47] Now, see,
[2073.70] it is better that go home and 
help Mama out instead of staying here.
[2077.73] You know how Papa worries her.
[2081.83] Yes, fine. You are right.
[2084.23] The poor thing’s heart is so full.
[2086.20] She is crying on the slightest of things.
[2089.07] Fine,
[2090.43] but listen, come soon.
[2091.77] Come in two hours.
[2093.23] I cannot sit here alone for so long.
[2095.23] I am leaving.
[2096.17] Okay, veil. 
Wear your veil and go.
[2098.10] I will also put on my veil.
[2100.13] You relax. Okay?
[2103.00] You will make a very pretty bride. 
I am scared.
[2109.23] I will come after two hours. Okay?
[2147.17] Be quick.
[2148.07] If someone sees me, 
it will be an issue.
[2150.27] Hey no one will see you,
 don’t worry.
[2152.70] We are going.
[2166.37] Is this your home?
[2169.27] Yes.
[2171.23] How do you like it?
[2173.87] Really good.
[2175.40] Come.
[2177.23] I will show you the entire home.
[2179.47] My room too.
[2182.33] I don’t see your mother and sister.
[2188.23] Actually, I wanted to surprise them.
[2189.60] They didn’t know you had to come.
[2192.00] I was not even sure about yourself.
[2193.73] Come.
[2205.33] Come on, we will sit here.
[2209.07] No, we will sit outside.
[2212.77] Hey, why would you sit outside.
[2214.87] I have to give you a surprise.
[2216.73] So sit inside. Come
[2219.03] and, this is not just my room,
[2222.37] it is our room.
[2226.47] Come inside.
[2238.13] You sit,
[2239.90] I will just come.
[2244.87] Oh!
[2246.50] Why are you closing the door?
