[25.73] What do you want?
[28.03] Should I stop coming to the mansion?
[33.77] If that’s what it is, then tell me, I will do it.
[36.47] How can you do this Nosherwan?
[39.27] If you do this, then I will tell everyone,
[42.37] that I am married to you, despite that 
you don’t give me my right.
[45.60] You have said this today,
[51.63] don’t say it ever again.
[57.73] Because you will even be 
deprived of this relation
[61.07] based on paper if you say 
something like that.
[69.53] Remember that.
[73.70] Nosherwan, I didn’t mean that.
[78.20] I was just saying that,
[80.73] what do I want from you?
[84.10] Your love and a little attention 
from you, that’s it.
[88.87] Nosherwan, how do I live like this?
[91.53] You come for a few days, 
then you leave.
[94.60] You think yourself, this is no life.
[98.20] Be grateful for what you have got.
[103.63] Even He doesn’t like ungratefulness.
[143.00] Our Fiza will go to her home 
after fifteen days.
[149.40] Congratulations.
[155.37] So soon? How did papa agree?
[157.80] They have said that 
we don’t know anything
[160.13] in the name of dowry, other than Fiza,
[161.77] then how could your father not agree?
[163.73] Hey, they are such good people,
[165.50] they even gave sweets and
 our Fiza is really pretty, right?
[167.90] There is no doubt in this, 
sister is actually really pretty.
[170.77] Come on,
[171.73] on this, have sweets.
[173.83] Yes. Yes.
[175.07] But how will we make 
preparations so soon?
[177.67] Hey, don’t scare me.
[179.20] I also have to make clothes.
[204.37] Meaning, the girl’s parents met and went,
[206.93] the relationship has been finalized.
[208.10] This means,
[209.37] brother is going to get married 
in ten to fifteen days.
[211.67] What did you think about Dua?
[213.33] That’s what I have to think about. 
Are you serious about her?
[217.30] What do you think?
[219.20] The way you went crazy seeing 
the first glimpse of her,
[222.43] you seem serious to me.
[225.63] Did you tell Dua?
[228.47] I didn’t tell her yet.
[231.10] If I tell her, she will get worried.
[233.03] Look, man, if you are serious for Dua,
[235.47] then tell your father not to get this wedding done.
[238.87] Man, let me talk to her first.
[241.13] Yes, that is also right.
[243.00] It is also necessary 
for her family to know.
[245.27] And yes, her father is really strict.
[247.87] If he says no, then, 
will you forget Dua?
[255.60] I can never forget her.
[340.53] You just arrived a few days back
[343.13] and you are already preparing to leave?
[345.47] There is some work in the city,
[347.80] it is necessary to go, Baba.
[351.10] The heart is not even satisfied 
looking at you,
[353.60] and you will disappear
from the sight again.
[356.80] I am not going forever, mama.
[359.27] I will come again.
[361.33] The children became 
happy seeing you.
[364.43] Now, if you leave, 
they will get sad.
[368.43] Now, you are both 
their uncle and father.
[375.10] Yes, I remember well.
[378.17] That is why I try that I am able 
to fulfill my responsibility well.
[384.17] You also a responsibility towards 
Kashmala too.
[388.07] Why do you forget that?
[390.57] Take Kashmala along.
[393.33] She goes around lost over here.
[398.23] It is like she has forgotten 
to laugh after Zawar.
[404.60] Baba Saeein, you asked me
 to get married, I did.
[410.03] Now please,
don’t force me further.
[416.47] She is your wife.
[420.17] How can I forget this reality,
[423.43] that snatched my love from me.
[427.23] Nosherwan, you live alone,
[431.67] doesn’t your heart feel anxious?
[435.70] When Kashmala and 
the children will be with you,
[438.50] then we too will be at peace.
[441.27] Amma, when am I at home.
[444.53] I leave in the morning and I don’t know 
where I will be in the evening.
[448.60] Please don’t put the responsibility 
of the children
[450.60] and Kashmala on me 
in such a situation.
[453.57] I have a hundred enemies in the city.
[456.13] You are here, 
Baba Saaein is here,
[457.93] so I am satisfied that 
they will be safe.
[460.43] But Nosherwan. 
Please, Baba Saaein,
[463.83] don't say things that 
I cannot accept,
[467.77] nor reject, and become 
disobedient to you.
[491.30] I called you so many times,
[493.17] you didn’t answer the phone.
[495.43] Sorry, man,
[497.43] papa’s friend’s father, passed away.
[503.60] I was in the funeral, so how could 
I answer the phone?
[506.60] But you should have told me.
[509.20] Hey, how could I tell you?
[511.20] You have told me not to call you.
[514.37] How could I call you, then?
[517.43] Yes,
[518.83] but you didn’t call, 
so God knows
[522.17] what sort of thoughts were 
coming to my heart.
[524.87] What were you thinking?
[526.73] Nothing. Just like that.
[530.73] You must be thinking that 
I am deceiving you.
[533.63] Hey,
[535.20] no. no.
[536.87] Don’t even think that,
[539.37] because your Faraz will 
never deceive you.
[544.37] I love you a lot.
[548.03] I don’t see anyone other than you.
[551.23] Really?
[552.50] Yes.
[554.97] I want to meet you. I am really 
restless to meet you.
[558.60] Shall we meet tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
[560.57] No. No.
[562.07] it is impossible tomorrow. 
Not at all.
[565.57] Then make the impossible, possible.
[570.23] We just met.
[571.73] Do you consider that fleeting 
moment a meeting?
[574.57] How will I meet you?
[576.53] Err…
[578.63] I…you know, 
if I get late from university,
[582.40] then mama and papa get really upset,
they scold me a lot.
[585.20] Yes, so I even have 
a solution for that.
[588.10] What we will do is that I will pick you up
 from university early in the morning,
[592.43] I will drop you back 
before the off time.
[595.47] This way, no one will find out that 
you were out with me all day long.
[600.20] So, long?
[602.00] What will you do for so long?
[603.70] Nothing.
[604.87] We will talk, we will go around,
[606.93] and I want to introduce you to mama.
[610.27] Mama?
[612.37] Why?
[614.07] Because they are talking about 
my marriage at home.
[617.23] I want that you meet mama once,
[620.43] so that they at least talk to papa.
[622.40] Okay.
[624.70] Give me some time to think.
[628.63] If you think so much,
[630.77] then I will get married 
to someone else.
[632.70] Oh,
[634.10] why do you say things 
that scare the heart?
[636.27] I told you, give me some time to think.
[639.17] Do you love me so much?
[642.77] You start losing your life hearing 
about my marriage with someone else.
[649.33] I love you a lot.
[666.73] We went to the market,
[668.40] but then we remembered,
[670.27] we don’t have the measurements 
for Fiza’s bangles and shoes.
[673.80] We came to get that.
[675.43] Yes. Yes. Why not? You did good.
[678.00] Go, child, bring juice for aunty…
[680.53] Yes, mama.
[681.97] What is the need for this? 
Leave the formalities.
[684.33] Hey, no, no, it is hot.
[686.57] Greetings.
[687.57] Greetings. Who is this?
[691.20] This is my daughter 
who is younger to Fiza.
[694.20] Okay. She is really pretty.
[698.03] Aunty, you didn’t tell us all 
your daughters are so pretty.
[701.03] You too are really pretty.
[702.97] Thank you.
[704.37] Where is our sister in law?
[706.30] Your sister in law is in the kitchen.
[708.30] Aunty, if you allow, 
then can I go to the kitchen?
[712.03] Child, what will you do 
in the kitchen inside,
[715.37] there is smoke and heat. 
Fiza will be here soon.
[717.50] No, no, there is nothing like that,
it is our own home.
[720.73] You go ahead.
[723.17] Come on, come. 
I will take you to the kitchen.
[725.83] Come on. 
Come.
[739.20] Why do you have to go so soon?
[741.40] Child, I will have to go back 
to come back.
[743.77] We didn’t even properly play 
any game till now.
[746.60] Okay, I promise, 
when I come next time,
[748.23] we will play a lot of games.
[749.67] Okay, uncle.
[751.40] I apologize for the interference, 
younger Saeein.
[754.27] But, the teacher of the children 
is waiting for them.
[756.97] Come on, children, 
the teacher is here. Come on.
[758.90] I can talk to you on call, right?
[761.40] Any time, child.
[763.60] Bye. Bye. Uncle.
[764.63] Bye. Bye. Have a good day. Bye. Bye. 
Go, study with your teacher.
[770.73] Why are you leaving so soon?
[774.97] You should have stayed a little longer.
[777.93] When I have to go, then what is 
going early and going later?
[782.27] But I want that you live here with me.
[789.47] Goodbye.
[790.93] Listen.
[796.40] You always leave me 
waiting every time.
[806.33] Don’t you feel pity on me?
[812.17] Are you reading a lot of
novels nowadays?
[819.53] Leave me,
[821.03] and focus on the home and children.
[844.57] Why are you standing here? 
Go outside, it is really hot here.
[847.73] There is no issue, 
it is fine here too.
[849.27] Okay, here, have cold juice.
[851.57] Thank you.
[854.00] Hey, go, serve it outside.
[856.47] Pick this up.
[857.60] You people also drink it. 
Yes, yes, we will drink it.
[860.43] You drink it.
[862.43] You know, I am really upset with you.
[864.97] Why with me?
[866.77] You people brought the groom’s 
picture that day,
[869.33] but you took it back without 
showing it to me.
[872.00] I am sorry. Actually, 
you were not there.
[874.13] But I will remove this complaint 
of your right now.
[876.30] How?
[878.13] I will show you pictures in the mobile.
[880.00] Oh yes, I didn’t think of this.
[883.97] I have some work, I will come.
[886.63] Hmm...
[888.67] He makes me click his pictures
 all the time.
[891.00] He is so handsome. 
He is also really photogenic.
[893.83] His pictures turn out to be so good.
[895.60] He is so good looking. 
I will show you.
[897.17] He looks like a hero. 
Really?
[898.37] Let me show you.
[902.83] This one? No, not this one.
[905.00] I will show you a good one.
[906.87] If he looks good, then 
he would look good, right?
[908.73] But a good picture is a good picture.
[910.93] Wait. Yes, this one. This one.
[916.60] My battery got low. 
My mobile switched off. Sorry.
[921.13] I will charge the phone 
and show you.
[926.97] Shall we go?
[928.77] Let’s go.
[943.87] Hello.
[945.03] Hello.
[947.33] You?
[949.40] I have such good luck.
[951.53] I was just thinking about you 
and you called.
[956.50] Let me talk to mama.
[959.37] Amma Saaein has gone 
to meet Shah Saeein.
[964.30] She wanted me to get 
something important.
[967.00] I was going to the mall, 
I thought I would call and ask.
[969.87] Okay, I will ask her and 
message you later.
[974.70] Okay, good.
[975.83] Okay listen, I too…
[978.97] Hello.
[980.87] Hello.
[982.13] Nosherwan.
[989.50] Maybe it got disconnected.
[992.80] I too wanted him to get something.
[998.40] I will message him.
[1004.53] That’s it. That’s it. Stop here.
[1016.87] Here you go, brother.
[1023.27] Come on.
[1025.03] Where have we come?
[1028.43] You had said that it is Fiza’s 
wedding next week
[1030.90] and you also wanted to 
get a new suit stitched.
[1032.80] Yes, but I cannot afford 
shopping from here.
[1035.57] Hey, we will not shop.
[1037.03] We will just look at designer dresses,
[1039.17] and then we will take pictures. 
You get it made for cheap.
[1041.70] Have you gone mad? 
I don’t want to go.
[1043.47] Hey, what is wrong?
Come on. Come.
[1058.77] Hey, we will see. 
Like this, buddy…
[1066.10] What is this, madam?
[1067.90] Leave my hand.
[1069.00] Leave her hand. 
Leave my hand.
[1070.93] Hey, girl,
[1072.43] how dare you raise your hand
at our squad?
[1076.00] I have so much courage, that I can 
break the face of people like him.
[1078.53] Stay in your limits, girl. You will 
have to be accountable for this.
[1081.60] Someone will be held accountable,
[1085.33] but not her…
[1094.10] Sir, the gun touched her by mistake,
[1095.50] this girl had slapped me. 
Whatever it was.
[1099.07] Is this how you will talk to a girl?
[1101.47] Apologize. 
Sorry, madam.
[1109.20] Forgive me, 
they are all my guards,
[1112.83] he collided with you by mistake.
[1114.93] Whether it was a mistake 
or on purpose,
[1116.93] he got punished.
[1120.20] Yes, he got punished.
[1123.53] You know, more than, them, 
it is the fault of people like you,
[1127.37] who bring so many people 
as trouble for us.
[1130.80] If you fear for your life so much,
[1132.63] then hide in your grand 
palaces out of fear.
[1134.97] Or if you're so fond, 
then fly in helicopters.
[1138.67] But don't come down to us in helicopters
just to trouble common people.
[1144.20] Look, talk with respect.
[1146.63] You don’t know 
who you are talking to.
[1149.20] I know well,
[1150.87] I am talking to the boss 
of people like you.
[1153.03] Dua, stop it. 
What are you doing?
[1155.20] I am showing people like them 
their real face.
[1157.27] Come from here. 
Come on.
[1159.03] Come from here.
[1165.37] Younger Saaein, 
she is a really arrogant girl.
[1173.20] Next time, think carefully about 
who you're addressing.
[1181.50] Sure.
[1182.27] There should be no breaking news
 for this moment,
[1185.33] and I want the footage 
for all these CCTV footage.
[1189.43] Sure.
[1191.33] And all the information of this girl.
[1299.77] Greetings.
[1300.67] Greetings. 
You are late again, today.
[1309.17] What is this?
[1310.97] This…
[1313.47] how have you come?
[1315.50] Where is your veil?
[1319.70] It is in the bag.
[1324.10] In the bag?
[1325.77] Hey, the veil is not to keep 
in the bag, it is to wear.
[1329.70] And if your father had seen you 
here instead of me,
[1332.67] then all hell would have 
broken loose till now.
[1336.30] Mama, have you ever thought about
anyone else other than papa?
[1338.97] Huh?
[1341.27] My BP was low, that’s why 
I removed it and put it in the bag.
[1344.77] But, I should have thought about it,
 my mama doesn’t care about me,
[1347.50] she only worries for papa.
[1348.73] Next time, even if I suffocate,
I will not remove my veil.
[1353.03] A person doesn’t step in the home,
[1355.40] and you start investigating 
like a police officer.
[1358.10] I have spent my life with your father.
[1360.27] I know, that is why I talk like this.
[1379.90] Saaein,
[1382.63] she disappeared suddenly.
[1383.77] We are unable to find out 
anything about her.
[1386.83] Find out what home she lives in.
[1395.47] What is going on here? Huh?
[1397.43] Where have you people come from?
[1398.70] Why are you entering here? Why?
[1400.87] Let us do our work, you be quiet.
[1403.23] I say, it is a neighborhood of 
decent people, get out of here.
[1405.57] Leave. Come on. 
Come on, leave.
[1408.73] Jaffar.
[1410.77] He is an old man.
[1411.90] Hey! Who did you call old?
[1414.13] Your father is old. Understand?
[1416.27] I can handle four young men
like you right now.
[1418.87] You are arguing. 
Leave from here.
[1421.20] Elder sir, I am caring for your age.
[1424.73] Leave from here. 
Hey,
[1427.00] don’t show aggression. 
Don’t show aggression.
[1429.83] Come on. Come on. See, 
what is he doing.
[1432.17] What is wrong, brother? 
What have you come here for?
[1434.13] Hey, he is misbehaving with me. 
Enough! Quiet.
[1437.53] Get out of here.
[1438.67] He is the son of a Nawab.
[1440.97] He must have come after a girl.
[1442.87] He didn’t find the girl,
[1444.23] he will kidnap someone’s daughter.
[1445.83] I am telling you for the last time,
mind what you say.
[1448.67] What will you do?
[1449.63] Enough!
[1452.27] Leave from here. 
Out! Leave!
[1454.97] You people go. 
All of you leave as well.
[1457.07] There is no show here. 
Please leave from here.
[1461.33] Come on, Jaffar.
[1462.73] Get lost.
[1463.87] Come on. Leave. 
He is talking.
[1465.53] Hey, come on, go.
[1467.80] What happened?
[1468.87] Papa had a fight 
with someone.
[1470.33] Papa had a fight? 
With whom?
[1472.20] I don’t know who they were.
[1473.50] Hey sister, the boy was 
so handsome, you missed him.
[1477.53] Just like a filmy hero.
[1479.63] Really? Come inside, 
if papa sees you,
[1482.27] he will make a film out of you. 
Heroine. Come on.
[1485.07] Come. 
I am coming.
[1491.07] Sir, the gun touched her by mistake,
[1492.43] this girl had slapped me. 
Whatever it was.
[1494.83] Is this how you will talk to a girl?
[1497.17] Apologize. 
Sorry, madam.
[1502.47] Forgive me, they are all my guards,
[1506.00] he collided with you by mistake.
[1555.40] Had I known I would get you hear 
your voice in response to my message,
[1559.80] then I would have messaged
 a long time back.
[1561.50] Really?
[1562.77] What were you doing?
[1564.10] Nothing.
[1565.20] I was just missing you.
[1569.23] I miss you too.
[1572.07] And what were you doing?
[1574.10] Nothing, I was just sitting.
[1576.70] Meaning, you were missing me.
[1579.33] Hmmm.
[1583.23] Okay, listen.
[1585.20] I had asked you for something.
[1587.07] What?
[1588.83] Hey, that meet me.
[1591.40] Okay, I have told you, 
give me some time.
[1594.77] Dua, I don’t have time.
[1597.20] I just want to introduce you to mama, 
as soon as possible.
[1600.60] I will think.
[1602.17] Dua,
[1603.43] you have already taken 
a lot of time.
[1606.07] I cannot wait anymore.
[1608.83] Why? Why is that?
[1611.37] They are talking about 
my marriage at home.
[1614.13] Hmmm.
[1615.77] Even we have wedding 
preparations in our home.
[1618.80] Huh?
[1620.17] What do you mean they are 
preparing for your wedding?
[1622.50] Hey, no, not my wedding.
[1624.43] My elder sister’s wedding.
[1626.10] I am a little busy at home 
preparing for it.
[1630.77] Say that, you scared me.
[1633.33] Really?
[1635.03] If the idea of my marriage scared you,
[1638.90] then what will happen if someone
 marries me off, tomorrow?
[1642.20] I will never let this happen. 
I cannot even think.
[1646.10] That’s it, that’s why I want that 
you meet mama as soon as possible.
[1652.90] Okay, fine.
[1654.80] Give me some time.
[1656.27] That’s it. You have to 
meet mama this week
[1659.17] and I want that you become 
part of my life, soon.
[1665.23] You know,
[1666.47] what the most beautiful moment
of my life will be?
[1670.23] When I will raise your veil
with my hands.
[1678.13] I will always keep you happy.
[1681.63] Dua.
[1684.13] Okay, I will put down the phone now.
[1726.87] Yes, Saeein?
[1729.47] I hope you have not returned 
empty handed.
[1733.40] This has never happened
[1736.73] that you order something and Jaffar 
returns empty-handed, Saeein.
[1742.17] Hmmm...
[1746.07] Her name is Dua, 
they are three sister,
[1749.80] they don’t have a brother.
[1752.00] She lives with her parents, 
she studies at the university,
[1757.63] the father manages the counter
at a cloth shop.
[1762.37] Their financial situation is not that good.
[1769.37] The father is really strict.
[1775.53] Some fiancé or relationship?
[1778.80] There is none.
[1781.33] Even if there was, why do you worry?
[1784.37] By the way,
[1786.20] it is her elder sister’s marriage next week.
[1792.17] Okay, I can wait for this long.
[1798.83] What, wait?
[1803.07] I mean,
[1804.80] you never took so much interest 
in any girl till today.
[1810.73] Now, if I want to bring peace in my life,
[1815.53] then why are you so surprised, Jaffar?
[1819.73] No,
[1821.10] I am not surprised.
[1823.20] By the way,
[1825.37] you look good smiling.
[1833.37] Someone else has become 
the reason for my smiles.
[1871.27] Saeein,
[1874.00] I am a little worried.
[1877.27] Kashmala has become really dull 
after Zawar’s departure.
[1882.00] She has stopped laughing 
and smiling.
[1885.07] Yes,
[1887.70] even I realize this.
[1891.33] But, not just Kashmala,
[1894.43] even Nosherwan.
[1895.93] I married both of them,
[1898.63] that both of them will live 
happily all their life.
[1903.07] We used to think that,
[1905.70] after Zawar, if Nosherwan will 
stay in front of our eyes,
[1909.87] then we will not miss Zawar.
[1913.33] But after marriage, it is like 
the mansion pushes him away.
[1918.87] He tries to run away from here 
on every other thing.
[1925.60] I had even told you not to force him,
[1929.50] but you didn’t listen to me at all.
[1933.27] You have been really unjust to my son.
[1937.23] Had Kashmala left this home,
[1939.90] then the children and all of Zawar’s 
wealth would have left with her as well.
[1945.37] I had no other option 
apart from Nosherwan.
[1950.00] Had I not forced him, then 
what would I have done?
[1952.53] Would I have let Nosherwan 
do what he wanted?
[1955.90] His class fellow would never have 
been acceptable to us.
[1961.20] That’s why, whatever I have done
is reasonable for my mansion.
[1968.17] You got them married,
[1971.17] but their hearts couldn’t be one.
[1974.03] Even today, that girl is in
Nosherwan’s heart.
[1977.43] He couldn’t take her one.
[1980.13] Hmm.
[1982.03] He doesn’t come to the mansion
for months.
[1985.23] Saeein, find out,
[1986.93] what if that girl is there
[1991.10] and he got married to her 
and kept her in the city.
[1993.63] No, no,
[1995.70] I am well informed.
[1998.10] He is not in touch with that girl.
[2000.77] And after all,
[2002.40] she got married to someone else, 
and a lot of time has passed since then.
[2007.60] Okay, that’s good.
[2010.57] Now, I pray to God that Nosherwan’s 
heart gets inclined towards the mansion.
[2015.47] Hah,
[2016.60] he is a man,
[2018.70] no matter where he goes,
[2020.60] he will return and come here.
[2024.50] The day,
[2026.17] the love of that girl leaves his heart,
[2028.63] he will return here.
[2030.87] Till today, he thinks that 
we were unaware of his love,
[2035.63] and we made him sacrifice 
unknowingly.
[2039.27] This is better.
[2042.00] Because awareness brings 
nothing but pain.
[2095.73] Is all okay?
[2100.30] How can anything be okay 
without you?
[2105.03] If there is something important, 
then tell me.
[2107.40] You know I want some privacy
at this hour of the night.
[2113.90] And how do I alleviate my loneliness?
[2118.93] When are you alone?
[2121.23] Bi Jaan, the children,
[2123.03] Baba Saeein is there.
[2126.07] I am the one who is alone.
[2131.67] Nosherwan, you are alone by your will.
[2135.87] You try calling out to me once.
[2139.90] I will leave everything 
and come to you.
[2144.47] You call out once.
[2148.03] I know.
[2153.33] Then, should I come to you?
[2155.60] Huh?
[2158.30] Right now, you rest,
[2160.90] I will put the phone down.
[2162.57] Nosherwan,
[2166.53] you are really stonehearted.
[2171.03] You are right,
[2173.83] I have a stone in my chest, 
and not a heart.
[2181.47] Years pass in trying to make 
a heart, a heart.
[2202.33] Nosherwan, I will make this stone a heart 
with my love and affection.
