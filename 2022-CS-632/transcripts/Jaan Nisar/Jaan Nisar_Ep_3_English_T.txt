[31.76] Water.
[32.48] Keep it.
[34.80] Did you make her understand?
[38.72] I haven’t spoken to Dua, yet.
[41.76] But don’t worry,
 I will make her understand.
[43.84] Make her understand, 
she is my daughter,
[46.88] not anyone else’s. Yes.
[50.36] Yes.
[51.00] And understand one more thing,
[52.40] these unveiled women
 wandering around.
[54.32] Hell-bound.
[55.00] They are hell-bound.
[56.40] My daughters,
[57.64] who haven't even 
reached adulthood yet,
[59.64] I have already made 
them wear burqas.
[61.40] My daughters are much better 
off than these hell-bound women.
[64.48] You should not say things like 
these about anyone’s daughters.
[66.96] Why? Why don’t you say it?
[68.60] Hey, these women,
[70.80] who roam around in the markets,
[72.88] they are hell-bound.
[74.24] And hear one more thing,
[75.96] they will take the hell 
fire with them like fuel.
[80.56] Will eat something?
[81.84] Should I make tea?
[82.80] Yes. Did Bakshi send anything?
[86.48] No.
[89.48] That damned man is a miser.
[91.52] I will go make tea.
[93.84] Why? Why would you make it?
[95.80] Ask your daughters.
[97.44] And listen,
[99.32] massage my head.
[101.52] I have a bad headache.
[104.20] I will tell them to make tea.
[107.60] Yes, tell them.
[129.64] Dua.
[131.12] Yes?
[132.08] Did you eat something?
[134.64] Yes, I ate.
[138.60] By the way,
[139.40] sister, you too should
 have come with us.
[142.36] Honestly, it was much fun.
[144.52] I popped so many balloons.
[147.28] Leave it.
[148.56] it is good that she didn’t go,
[150.00] or else she too
[150.96] would have had to listen to Papa scolding 
her on a foreigner’s invitation.
[154.80] It is like getting scolded
 by Papa is her fate.
[162.32] How did the boys look?
[165.28] What is the matter?
[166.04] Let me ask. Tell me.
[167.60] How were they?
[168.56] Were both of them handsome
[169.92] or was just one of them handsome?
[176.52] I don’t know. I didn’t see.
[180.32] Meaning,
[181.64] you got scolded for no reason.
[185.96] You have started to speak a lot.
[187.44] I feel I have to pull your ears a lot.
[190.68] No, no,
[191.40] she only shuts up when
[193.32] she is in front of Papa.
[195.32] It feels as though her 
blood is going to run dry.
[198.20] Yes, right?
[199.68] She only talks when
 she has to work.
[223.40] Dua.
[224.72] Yes?
[225.20] You know, Kiran.
[226.60] Even her mother had come
 to Mr. Bakhshi’s home.
[228.80] You know, 
she is going to get married.
[230.32] Who Kiran?
[231.44] Hey, Aunt Rehmana’s daughter.
[233.96] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[235.08] She used to be small,
[236.36] she is going to get married.
[281.72] Welcome, sir. Welcome, sir.
[283.72] Sir, we are very lucky
[285.28] that you came personally to give 
a donation to our university.
[289.44] Thank you very much, sir.
[290.72] Thank you very much, sir.
[291.48] Come on. Come on. Please, sir.
[292.60] Thank you very much.
[293.92] Thanks to people like you…
[311.92] Thank you very much, sir.
[313.92] You came here and
 really honored us.
[317.20] You really care for our university.
[321.24] Keep this, please.
[324.12] May God…
[329.08] Thank you very much, sir.
[401.00] Sir, are you looking for someone?
[406.88] Huh?
[408.08] Are you looking for someone?
[409.44] No, I will just leave.
[472.40] Your younger master is coming to 
the mansion after a long time.
[475.88] Make sure he doesn’t 
dislike anything.
[478.12] And did you make all
 the dishes he likes, right?
[480.60] Yes, Amma Saeein.
[482.12] You did well.
[483.32] And you people also be careful.
[485.40] Now, he comes after days,
[487.56] he shouldn’t get
 a chance to complain.
[489.48] Okay?
[491.08] Yes, madam Saeen,
[491.76] younger master is here.
[493.16] Come on. Come on.
[602.04] How are you?
[603.56] Absolutely fine, 
now that you are here.
[613.04] Where is Baba Saeein?
[617.92] Inside. Come.
[618.84] He is waiting for you. Come.
[620.12] Come on.
[642.20] You have started to 
make us wait a lot.
[645.40] Don’t you feel like 
meeting your mother?
[648.24] Why won’t I feel like it?
[650.48] Then why do you visit after so long?
[653.40] My eyes long to see you.
[657.20] After all,
[659.96] after Zawar,
[660.84] this mansion has 
become really deserted,
[668.16] and you too have 
increased the distances.
[671.00] Mama, there are no distances.
[673.36] Karachi is not far.
[676.12] You come over whenever you want to.
[681.88] Okay,
[683.00] I will visit often now.
[686.76] every time promise that 
you will come soon,
[690.28] and then you forget 
after you leave.
[695.96] Okay, you please don’t cry.
[697.04] I promise that
[699.40] I will come sooner now.
[701.72] The son has come after so long
[703.80] and you have started your
 complaints and grievances.
[706.84] Please serve him.
[711.72] I got everything he likes cooked.
[714.28] Should I have food served?
[715.24] No, not right now.
[716.44] Let me go meet the children.
[718.48] Okay.
[719.08] Go.
[725.92] Yes, so how are you two?
[727.76] I am really good.
[728.96] You know, he is really bad.
[731.20] She is the bad one, uncle.
[732.64] She is always 
falsely praising herself.
[734.60] No. No. No. Don’t fight.
[736.80] You don’t talk like this.
[737.84] Tell me, how are studies
 going for both of you?
[739.40] Really good.
[740.16] Yes?
[740.80] Yes.
[741.28] And how did you like these gifts?
[742.56] Really good.
[774.16] Greetings.
[775.72] Greetings.
[776.64] All okay?
[777.60] Why are you standing
 outside like this?
[779.16] I was waiting for a child.
[782.20] Actually, I had to get the bill paid.
[784.56] Give it to me, I will do it.
[786.36] Hey, no, no, you will be bothered.
[788.60] Some child will get it done.
[789.68] Hey, what is the botheration in this?
[791.24] A person does this much for neighbors.
[793.36] I went to get the bill paid during the day,
[795.36] there was so much rush there,
[797.08] I came back.
[797.92] I thought I would get it 
paid through a child.
[800.04] You give it to me, I will deposit it.
[802.96] I hope I am not bothering you.
[804.08] No big deal. I will just
 go and come back.
[816.44] How is the planning 
for your factory going?
[820.36] Yes, I have just given 
the blueprint to be made.
[823.00] As soon as it arrives,
[824.16] the work will begin.
[825.56] Hmmm.
[827.48] These things shouldn’t be delayed.
[830.24] Tea.
[831.44] Thank you.
[832.84] By the way,
[834.56] you won the hearts of people 
announcing the factory.
[839.48] We won't have to work hard for
 the votes in the next elections.
[847.96] No Baba Saeein,
[850.16] I am not doing all this to win the votes.
[858.56] I really want to do 
something for my people.
[861.84] Hmmm. This is a good thing.
[866.20] Not just a factory,
[867.72] I plan on making a college 
and university too.
[872.12] Where my own people 
can get educated.
[873.92] Hun..
[875.00] Then just think
[877.28] that you've solidified the political future 
for the next seven generations of ours.
[887.64] A little while back you were telling me
[890.00] that the son has come after so long,
[891.36] what are you talking about?
[892.76] And now you are just
 talking about politics.
[894.96] Hey, you talk about things you like.
[897.72] When is there a restriction on you?
[907.24] Nosherwan.
[908.28] Yes?
[909.32] Son, you are alone there,
[911.36] you take care of yourself, right?
[927.56] Nosherwan.
[928.44] Yes?
[929.48] Where did you get lost?
[931.96] I…no, nothing. Just like that.
[951.12] Madam,
[953.12] try that younger master 
doesn’t go back this time.
[957.88] The girls of Karachi are really smart,
[960.04] if someone gets a hold of him,
[961.36] then you will be in a tough spot.
[1010.16] Did you pay the bill?
[1011.52] It got paid.
[1013.48] Here is your bill
[1015.32] and the remaining amount.
[1017.08] Thank you very much.
[1019.08] I can do this much for you,
[1020.92] it is our responsibility.
[1022.64] We are neighbors
[1024.08] and let me tell you,
[1026.24] neighbors are closer 
than your own blood.
[1028.04] Yes.
[1028.64] Yes.
[1029.36] Now, we live next door,
[1030.16] it would be better to share
 both joys and sorrows, right?
[1033.44] Okay, I will go now.
[1034.52] Yes.
[1035.12] One more thing.
[1036.52] What?
[1037.56] Please keep the door closed,
[1039.08] it is a matter of privacy.
[1045.76] Tomorrow? So soon?
[1048.12] Why?
[1048.68] Do you have an 
issue with tomorrow?
[1051.08] Hey, I have no issues.
[1053.52] How will we make
 preparations so soon?
[1055.52] Then, I still haven’t 
spoken to Mr. Aslam.
[1057.80] So, I am sitting here,
[1059.12] I will talk to Mr. Aslam.
[1061.08] They are really good people,
[1062.60] very religious.
[1064.24] And I like the family so much,
[1066.68] that don’t ask.
[1067.88] They made the desire to see, Fiza,
[1070.16] so I gave them time for tomorrow.
[1076.52] I will go and check.
[1083.20] Greetings.
[1084.44] Greetings. How are you, Mr. Aslam?
[1087.24] Thank God. Fix your scarf.
[1090.32] Oh, it is a still scarf,
[1092.44] it doesn’t stay on the head at all.
[1093.88] Now tell me,
[1096.80] why did you come?
[1098.16] I came for Fiza’s proposal.
[1100.52] They are good people,
[1101.36] so I have asked them 
to come tomorrow.
[1102.92] Really?
[1105.20] Tomorrow? Isn’t it too soon?
[1107.28] Now you too don’t think
 about haste like your wife.
[1110.92] Look, Mr. Aslam,
[1112.00] good proposals don’t wait for anyone.
[1114.96] Yes, that is true.
[1116.20] Bua, you know,
[1118.44] we have no demands.
[1120.20] They can make demands from us.
[1122.96] We just need a decent boy.
[1124.56] Just a decent boy,
[1125.72] who is religious,
[1127.28] he follows the religion.
[1129.48] If he has a little money,
[1131.04] if he has a business, 
then even that will be fine.
[1132.76] Hey, you don’t worry about this at all.
[1135.56] They are really simple people.
[1139.00] Fine, then. Go ahead.
[1141.76] Okay, then,
[1142.36] make arrangements for tea tomorrow.
[1144.88] Yes, we will. Don’t worry.
[1147.16] Okay, Fehmida,
[1148.36] we will meet tomorrow.
[1149.00] I will go now.
[1149.60] I have to go somewhere else too.
[1150.52] Okay.
[1152.68] Okay,
[1154.48] this means that
[1157.04] the groom’s family is 
coming to see the bride.
[1160.64] Hmmm
[1168.40] Do you know, mama?
[1169.96] Uncle got a lot of toys for us.
[1173.32] Really?
[1174.28] Then you people must 
be enjoying it a lot.
[1175.88] A lot.
[1178.52] Okay listen,
[1179.76] when uncle has brought 
you such good gifts,
[1183.16] then you too don’t have 
to bother him in return,
[1185.08] okay?
[1185.92] He is never bothered by us.
[1188.24] Yes, mama,
[1189.24] uncle is always happy with us.
[1191.68] Really?
[1195.40] Son, you are alone there,
[1197.44] you take care of yourself, right?
[1203.00] Nosherwan.
[1204.04] Yes?
[1204.92] Where did you get lost?
[1206.04] I…no, nothing. Just like that.
[1211.76] Children,
[1213.12] you have to go to school, right?
[1214.24] Yes?
[1214.72] So, don’t you have to sleep?
[1215.80] Okay, mama. Goodnight.
[1217.20] Goodnight. Bye.
[1219.72] Well done. Goodnight.
[1224.68] I will come and check.
[1226.00] Sleep quickly.
[1226.56] Okay. Okay.
[1233.32] Try that younger master 
doesn’t go back this time.
[1238.04] The girls of Karachi are really smart,
[1240.28] if someone gets a hold of him,
[1241.64] then you will be in a tough spot.
[1336.08] You are just sitting down to study?
[1338.04] Don’t turn on the light or else
[1339.48] I won't be able to wake 
up for the late-night prayers.
[1399.76] Beloved Dua,
[1402.52] Since I've laid eyes on you,
[1404.44] I've lost track of day and night.
[1407.48] Lost in your thoughts all the time,
[1410.52] it's as if I've disconnected from the world
[1411.88] and only your presence lingers.
[1414.12] I long to gaze upon your face.
[1418.12] I don't know what you think of me,
[1420.40] but after meeting you,
[1422.92] I'm incapable of thinking of anything else.
[1425.76] I've fallen in love with you.
[1427.80] I've fallen deeply in love with you.
[1437.04] Who is it?
[1440.68] Huh? Who is it?
[1444.08] Oh,
[1447.00] get lost from here.
[1449.92] Uh-huh.
[1480.96] This time, you visited after a long time.
[1485.56] I was busy.
[1489.76] You got something for everyone,
[1493.36] didn’t you bring anything for me?
[1497.80] You have everything.
[1502.48] When do I have everything, Nosherwan?
[1507.76] Even after having so much,
[1511.56] I feel that my hands are empty.
[1516.40] Everyone really misses you here.
[1520.92] Yes, I know.
[1527.16] Don’t you miss me?
[1531.84] I never stop missing.
[1538.32] Take out the car. Brother.
[1540.72] Brother, nothing will happen to you.
[1541.60] Brother, nothing will happen to you.
 I am here, brother.
[1543.20] Brother!
[1548.12] Where are you going now?
[1551.72] My friends have come over,
 they are waiting for me.
[1558.76] And…and me?
[1562.60] What about me waiting for you, 
for so long?
[1568.08] You, go to sleep.
[1573.40] I will be late.
[1577.68] Nosherwan…
[1668.84] Don’t you miss me?
[1688.16] We are going to get married.
[1697.84] I tried hard to stop it,
[1699.36] but I was unsuccessful.
[1709.40] I am surely getting married,
[1714.56] but only because of 
Baba Saeein, and Amma.
[1722.28] It is their wish that 
the children and you
[1726.96] always live in this mansion.
[1733.12] There should be 
no change in your life.
[1741.24] If something will change,
 then it will be in me.
[1747.52] I will never be able to 
accept this wedding.
[1761.92] It will be no less than a test 
for me to see you in this form,
[1767.08] after seeing you in the 
form of my sister-in-law.
[1776.76] If you want,
[1778.20] you can say no to this wedding.
[1792.84] Imagine, if this wedding takes place,
[1797.04] then you will surely be my wife,
[1803.36] I will also give you 
the right to be my wife,
[1815.88] but don’t expect love from me.
[1867.36] Hi.
[1869.16] Hi.
[1871.08] What happened?
[1873.32] Nothing. What will happen?
[1876.88] Are you feeling okay?
[1878.84] You were not even coming to 
university for so many days.
[1881.44] I am fine. What will happen to me?
[1885.68] What happened?
[1888.68] You will tell me, that.
[1890.72] Did you talk to Faraz?
[1892.92] He seemed really restless for you.
[1895.72] Who told you? Brother Fahad?
[1898.12] Don’t take his name.
[1899.48] Damned man.
[1900.96] Why? What happened?
[1902.08] Did you two fight?
[1903.48] Fight?
[1904.72] I used to fight daily.
[1907.16] But, I broke up with him last night.
[1910.52] Break up?
[1911.64] Yes, so what could I do?
[1912.92] He turned out to be a weird psycho.
[1915.16] And on top of that, a big miser.
[1917.76] I had asked him to take 
me shopping once,
[1920.40] but no,
[1921.24] he was saying no to me for so long.
[1923.12] Last night, he was 
saying to me that
[1924.56] I don’t have money to 
take you shopping.
[1926.28] Leave it.
[1927.04] So I left him.
[1929.88] The first one was fine, you know.
[1931.84] At least, he would 
take me shopping.
[1935.84] I feel that I got his curse.
[1944.48] Now, how will I meet Faraz?
[1958.04] Yes?
[1958.84] Wow,
[1960.32] you are really dressed up today.
[1962.60] Yes, I had to get dressed today.
[1964.44] I have to go to meet Dua.
[1965.80] So, shall we go?
[1968.16] No, man, I cannot go.
[1971.48] Why?
[1972.08] I had a fight with Rida, and
[1974.48] she broke up with
 me in her anger.
[1977.36] Then?
[1978.68] Hey, then, why are you worried?
[1980.40] Hey, did you find
 this time to break up?
[1983.04] My love story hasn’t even started
[1984.76] and you broke up?
[1986.20] Hey, girls are in the habit 
of showing tantrums.
[1988.80] First, they break up, 
then they mark off,
[1990.88] then they put up weird statuses.
[1992.60] And yes, remember,
[1994.76] Dua will do the same.
[1996.28] I am telling you.
[1998.92] That poor thing doesn’t 
even have a phone.
[2003.88] Hey, why don’t you do one thing?
[2005.76] Look, you are going to 
meet her for the first time.
[2007.72] She doesn’t have a phone,
[2008.84] you gift her a phone.
[2010.36] She will be happy
[2011.16] and your work will be easy too.
[2013.20] Look, brother,
[2014.08] how long will you hide from her father
[2015.96] and drop letters to her?
[2018.04] This is right.
[2020.36] Okay fine, I will go.
[2021.92] I have to go with Papa for some work.
[2023.28] We will meet again.
[2024.16] Yes,
[2025.88] I am going to meet her for the first time,
[2027.52] so I will need your car.
[2032.72] Yes, your idea is good.
[2035.64] Go have fun. Here you go.
[2038.80] Okay fine, best of luck.
[2040.52] Yes.
[2051.80] Yes, son, how are you?
