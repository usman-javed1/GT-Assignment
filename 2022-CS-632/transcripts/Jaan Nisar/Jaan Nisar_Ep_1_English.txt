I am Nosherwan Ghaznavi. Baba and Amma Saeen’s beloved son. Brother Zawar’s life. Who did what he
 wanted since childhood; I fulfilled every desire, and made every
 impossible thing possible. But there also came a time, when I had to compromise 
on my preferences. I had to live a life that
 I didn’t even think of. Only for the sake of 
the happiness of my own. I believe that life often brings
 a person to a point, where they have a well in front 
and a pit behind them. But the trials of relationships push us into such deep 
quagmires from which, even if we wish to escape, we cannot. It's not us passing life; rather, life is passing us. And escaping from such a life 
is not possible even if we desire it. Dua. What are you doing? Is this the behavior of 
a girl from our home? Where is this sound 
of music coming from? Papa. Papa? We are dead. Turn it off. Huh? Turn it off immediately. Greetings. Where was the sound of 
music coming from? Not at all. What are you hiding? Show me. Show me! Oh God, how did this damned box? In my home? How? How did it come to this home? I bought it from the scrap seller. Where did you get the money from? I sold the magazines… Magazines? You sold magazines? Meaning all sorts of indecent content? Magazines also come to this house? Hey, why did you not slap her ten times and stop her? Mama had stopped me. She scolded me a lot. She scolded me a lot. Hey, God damn it. Music is being played in 
the home of Akram’s son. Indecent magazines 
are being brought here. And the neighbors are listening. No, I mean, I made a mistake. Sorry. Hey, you made a mistake… All this is happening because of 
you going to college and university. Yes, this education is spoiling you. It is over. She will not go to college
 and university from today. No, no, forgive her. Nothing like this will ever
 happen after today. Papa, sorry. I made a mistake. I will not do this again. Don’t stop my education. This won't happen again. It will never happen again. If it does, then I will bury you all one by one, and commit suicide myself. Why do you do this? Do you know the consequences of 
stopping me in the way, Dilawar? Hey, I have to talk to you. Like this, on the road? Whether it is a road or a mountain, I have to talk right now. Nosherwan Ghanznavi decides when
 and whom he has to talk to. You have one minute. After one minute, my guards will pull the trigger, then don’t blame me. Did you not hear what Saeen said to you? If bullets are fired from that side, they will also be fired
 from this side as well. There will be bloodshed, and I don’t want that. So, I will leave right now, and I will also allow you to leave. The next meeting will be at my home. You will come yourself. Dilawar, maybe you have
 no idea how costly calling me against 
my will can be for you. Let’s go, man. Saeen, I had told you not to go alone and take me with you, but you said no to me. When did that stop you, Jaffar? You came here following me. What could I do, Saeen? God forbid, had something happened
 to you today, I wouldn’t have been able
 to forgive myself all my life. You've ruined the
 minds of your daughters. You couldn’t even give birth to a son. Is this their upbringing? Hey, your daughters are dancing. Akram Shahab's granddaughter. You've kept a radio in the house. They're dancing. They are not ashamed at all. I feel like choking everyone to death. Get lost from here. Hey. What is it now? Has papa left? He left. Okay listen, what is Mama doing? She is crying after hearing what Papa said. I didn’t want that. Dua, you are not new in this home. When you are aware
 of Papa’s temperament. So, don’t give him
 such an opportunity. He just wants an opportunity to remind Mama of everything 
from the past and present. Why do you put Mama’s life in 
difficulty by doing such stupidity? What did I do? I had just bought a radio. And because of that one radio, Papa has asked Mama to make 
you quit your university, along with taunting her 
for not giving birth to a son. And if she makes you quit university, then these few moments of freedom you get from
 this imprisonments, even they will be snatched. And if you do anything wrong again, then Papa will put a seal 
on this decision of his. Okay, fine. Why are you scaring me? I will be careful. Listen, come to Mama with me. Put in a good word, please. Come on. Lovely. I didn’t do good. Get a grip on yourself, Mama. Stop it. Mama. Stop it, mama. Why are you worrying yourself? You know… Papa’s temperament. Fiza tell her, I don’t want to talk to 
her about anything. Why don’t you want to talk to me? What have I done? I just played a little radio. Hey, despite committing 
such a grave sin in a house where ten concerns 
are raised for breathing, you're asking what you have done? Be thankful that you are still alive. Okay, I will be thankful too. What was the need for you 
to buy a radio and bring it? Why don’t you say what is the need to breathe freely? At times, I want to 
run away from here. Dua. What? Think before you speak. You are speaking without thinking. Yes, so? The more there will be 
restrictions on speaking, the tongue will be equally bitter. Everyone has made such a face like God knows what happened to them. Although, I am not the one who didn’t eat food, I am the one who got scolded, and my radio got broken. But no, dare anyone care for me. Has anyone ever asked
 me as a formality that child, you must be hungry, will you eat? Hey, what’s for food? I am really hungry. Mama made cauliflower 
and potatoes. What did she cook? Cauliflower potatoes, gourd potatoes, eggplant potatoes. Do we get potatoes for free? I don't want to eat potatoes. I don't want these vegetables. Make something good for once, 
like chicken, meat, or chicken curry. No need to make so much noise. Be thankful and eat 
whatever has been cooked. If Papa hears your thoughts, then another problem
 will be created for us. Then he should hear it, but I don’t want to eat this cauliflower and potatoes, every day. Hey, why did I take a day off? I would have comfortably 
sat in the canteen and eaten something. I don’t know where have I been born. What do I do with this girl? She is becoming a test for me. Brother. Brother. Brother. What is your problem? You are screaming close to 
my ear early in the morning. Early morning? It is beyond 12 noon. Yes, so what is new in this? The clock strikes 12 noon every day. Mama has said that you wake up before 
the afternoon prayers, and go to the shop. Papa must be waiting for you. Oh man, this problem of the shop… What? Filmy magazine? In your room? If Papa sees it, then? Hey, so who will tell Papa? And who told you to come to 
my room and investigate? What is the need for you to
 keep this in your room? What would you know, they have thousands of followers. Leave their followers and
 focus on the shop brother. Man, I am really tired of this shop, I don’t know what Papa’s problem is. It would have been better if I hadn’t completed my college education. You should help Papa out anyway, right? Okay, don’t lecture me. Go and make breakfast. I will, but you wake up quickly and get fresh. Get fresh. It is finally morning for the prince, huh? You are awake! Mama, I don’t understand, why you taunt me as 
soon as you see me. I am already in a bad mood. I don’t get to sleep enough, and you wake me up 
early in the morning, so that I go and sit at the shop. So, sleep early at night. How will you wake up
 early in the morning, if you are on your 
phone all night long? Yeah, right, I am on my phone. I don’t have a fiancée, who I sit and chat with. I just have friends, I just chat with them on the phone. Do you understand the hint, mama? When do I have a fiancée that I chat with her on the phone? This means, now he should have a fiancée, with whom he can chat on the phone. Listen to me, don’t instigate
 the matter, understand? Brother has the desire in his heart, but he doesn’t let go of his pride. I had asked you for breakfast, go bring it. Oh yes, I forgot,
I have kept it on the stove. Mama, I’m keeping this, there. Yes, now I will look
 for a girl for you. You have appeared for
 your graduation exam. Now when you get 
your result and find a job, then I will marry you. Mama, what is this condition of finding
 a job you have put on my marriage? Don’t worry, I will find a working woman for you, someone who does a job. Okay, now will I live on my wife’s earnings? The times when wives 
used to be at home and the husbands used 
to work have passed. Now, the times are such that things work out when 
both of them work. Hey, I don’t want to get married. Give me breakfast. Greetings, Mr. Aslam. Greetings. Greetings. How are you? So, how much 
are these apples for? These are apples from 
Quetta. From Quetta. They are really juicy. Yes, that’s why they
 look red and fresh. Taste it. What is the rate? I will give them to you
 for two fifty rupees. How many kilos do 
you want, Mr. Aslam? Huh…how much… leave it right now. Huh? Yes, buddy. Yes, what is going on? Nothing, man, I am just sitting free, doing nothing. Yes, even I can see that. Brother, tell me, do you want to do something 
after getting free from college, or do you want to sit free like this? I want to do a lot, but for that, two million to two and 
a half million rupees, and I don’t have that. Hey man, this is the problem 
with us young people. We have a lot of ideas, but we are short on cash, and if you try to explain
 your idea to the family that there is so much 
investment required, they'll say go and 
do a janitor's job. I mean, look at me. They made me sit at the
 shop after my education, now I was not born to do small jobs. You are so handsome. What do they say, you should be the
 owner of an ad agency. Yes, that’s how it is, but I don’t know where 
our fate is sleeping. I have been sitting
 here for so long, and you didn’t even 
offer me a cup of tea? Sorry. Sorry. Brother, bring two cups of tea. And yes, listen, we have to go tomorrow. Where do we have to go? I will tell you when I come tomorrow. Come on, start eating. Here. Where is Dua? Huh? Call Dua? She is studying sitting on the roof. Hey, tell her, Mr. Mirza has sent such
 amazing food for the niyaz. This miser sends food seldom. Huh? He was saying it is really delicious. And I have eaten the food from Mr. Mirza, it is delicious. Go, and call Dua. Come on. Mr. Aslam, she doesn’t like these
 lentils and vegetables. She doesn’t eat it. When you go out after 
having food, then bring me some meat, and I will cook it for her. Okay, chicken, meat, is her food not complete without this? Huh? If she doesn’t want to eat it, 
then she shouldn’t. And how are you bringing 
the children up, Fehmida? Teach them the value of contentment. They need to go to their own homes. We will end up empty-handed here. And this is all we'll have at our home. Come on, eat. Take it. Eat. And the one who doesn’t
 want to eat, shouldn’t. they should die of hunger if they want. I don’t care if they die of hunger. Hey, this is my food. Please, where are you taking it? Please, give me this food. This is my food. My food. Where are you taking it? Don’t take it. Don’t take it. It is mine. Don’t take it. Don’t take my food. This is my food. 
Dua. My food. It is my food. My food… Dua. Where is my food? I had so much food. I was in such a big home, man. You must surely be dreaming, right? It must be a dream. Are you hungry? Should I bring
 something for you to eat? You are saying it like we have dynamite prawns 
and manchurian. You know…you know, even if I die of hunger, then you don’t even feed anyone dried 
bread on my third day of mourning. Move this. Have food. I don’t want to eat it. If you don’t eat, then 
you will remain hungry. You didn’t even eat 
anything all day long either. It is better that I don’t eat, and stay hungry instead 
of eating all this. I feel nauseous smelling all this. Dua, this is sustenance. I know this is sustenance. But, is it only this vegetable, lentils? Is what I am saying not sustenance? Mama, why don’t you understand? Your father has finally
 found a job at a tailor’s shop after sitting at home
 for several months. The fees for your 
university goes after combining Fiza’s salary 
and the money that he earns. The rent for this home, the electricity and gas bills
 are paid with difficulty. If I had sons, it would 
have been different. Now, should we also put both
 girls on earning a livelihood? You should. You should, at least, we will get something good to eat. Don’t talk nonsense, 
and have food. I told you, I don’t want to eat it, meaning, I don’t want to eat it. If you don’t eat, you will die of hunger. So, let me die. At least this way, you people will get good food to eat for 
at least three days out of sympathy. Shut up. If you don’t have a good fate, then at least speak good. When will fate get 
good by talking good? I don’t know how long
 all this will go on for. Stop it. Mama. Mama. What is wrong, Mama? Because of her… Don’t you feel sorry for Mama? Why do you bother her so much? I feel sorry. I feel sorry for myself. I don’t know where I was born and why I was born. Stop your nonsense now. Mama. Mama, stop it. What is wrong, Mama? You cry so much about 
what she is saying. She always does this. Mama, tell me something. You are my mother, right? When you knew that your husband wasn’t worthy of earning 
and feeding the children, then why did you give birth 
to three daughters? Stop it. Now if you
say another word, it won't be good, Dua. Understand? Leave her, you come from here. Okay? When she feels hungry, she will eat herself. The hunger has gone 
to her head right now. There is nothing else. Let her be. By the third day, even carrion starts to 
seem permissible to people. You come on. Mama, come on. Leave it. Yes, everyone leave me. It makes no difference to me. 
Come from here. You have left me anyway. What difference does anything 
about me make to anyone? I won't eat it. 
I don’t want to eat. What sort of colors are
 you showing me? Show me good colors. Show them the rosy cloth. Show them the rosy cloth, it will look good on
 her complexion. Yes, you look at this one. Greetings. Greetings. Show me this one too. Brother Aslam, I thought
 I would give you, your salary. Yes. Here you go, brother. Count it, it is the full amount. Brother Azam, I wanted if you 
could increase my salary a little. Hey no, even I can manage this counter. Now see, you said I want a job. Your father and
 my father were friends, so I couldn’t say no. Think about it, the fees of the school and 
university of the daughters have increased a lot, and you also see 
the inflation, brother Azam. Hey, look, Mr. Aslam, what you say is right. But, I can do one thing. I have a friend, he needs a loader. The work is surely less, but it requires hard work. If you want, should I talk to him? No. No. But you will have to work hard. No, no, there is no need. There is no need. Now, what hard work will
 I do in this old age? I won’t be able to. Anyway, as you wish. But see, come early tomorrow. The boy was telling me that you are coming late for 
the past one week. Where are you going right now? I was just changing
 my seating position. Hey, Mr. Aslam, at least give your 
full time at the shop. The business won’t work like this. Brother Azam,
 I will continue to sit here. If you tell me, I will sit here 
for twenty-four hours. Thank you. Thank you very much. Show me what you can do. Brother, let’s have a competition today. Hmmm. Very nice. I feel you will win today. Let this last shot hit the target. Brother, you were right. Brother. What happened brother? Take out the car. Brother. Brother, nothing will happen to you. Brother. Take out the car. Brother. Brother, 
nothing will happen to you. I am here, brother. Brother. Brother, I wish, that day, that bullet had
 hit me instead of you. Poets have written 
ghazals for these eyes. Oh God. What a shameless girl. The entire bus is filled 
with men and this girl... Yes, sir, what can we say? Times have changed nowadays. These are all signs of
 the day of judgement. Signs of the day of judgement. No doubt. We have to keep an eye on our
 daughters because of girls like her. You are right. I don’t know even if 
her parents are aware of what her daughter is up to outside. Sister, fare? My maternal and paternal
 uncles are sitting at the back, take it from them. Leave it, buddy, she rides daily. Wait. Here you go. Hey, see, she is not a wax doll, she also speaks. The court appearance is tomorrow. The lawyer called and said that the opposing party
 would sign a settlement if you withdrew your case. The lawyer wants to 
meet you once, before appearing in front of the judge. Find another lawyer. After today, this lawyer shouldn’t be seen 
handling any of my cases. Any special reason? The lawyer who wants to
 favor my opposing party and change my thinking, I will change him. Okay Saeen, you also had to visit the mansion. It has been long since
 you visited the mansion. I will tell you when I want to go. Saeen, we were getting calls 
from the mansion. What do I say to them? Saeen. Saeen. Deen Muhammad has 
come to meet you, Saeen. Saaen. Saeen. Hey, what are you doing? Stand up. Saeen, my daughter. Saeen, the hooligans
 abducted our daughter. We don’t even have
 an enmity with them We are your followers, Saeen. Save our daughter, Saeen. Who abducted her? Dilawar. Dilawar took her. Dilawar took her. Dilawar. Jaffar.
