[27.76] Fehmida, did you have your breakfast?
[30.84] No, Sania is making it,
[34.44] she is new to house chores
[36.56] that is why she is slow.
[38.52] You have your breakfast,
you have to go to work,
[41.00] I and Sania will do it later.
[43.60] Sumbul got married,
[47.00] and that’s good.
[48.20] It’s a huge deal if girls get
married at the right age.
[57.96] Only Sania is left now.
[62.64] Mr. Aslam,
[64.08] Sania is very young right now
and she is still studying.
[67.32] Yes, but we will also get her
married early, Fehmida.
[74.76] Just when you find a nice proposal
as Sumbul’s in a year or so,
[79.24] get her things finalized too.
[83.72] Hmm,
[86.96] I used to be against
what you said earlier
[91.68] but now that I think of it,
[94.16] what you said seems right.
[99.72] I have gotten very scared because of Dua.
[106.64] Sania’s age is the age
when girls get provoked.
[121.20] Parents shouldn’t give such
a chance to their daughters.
[125.00] Thank God,
[125.96] you understood what I said.
[129.16] Yes, I do.
[132.20] When a girl and a boy are tied in a
relationship with each other at the right time,
[140.88] a person is saved from a lot of problems.
[149.24] Neither girls run away from home
[152.92] nor their parents have to
face such humiliation.
[165.36] It’s better that daughters
get married at the right time.
[168.44] Indeed.
[170.00] The times are very bad, Fehmida,
[172.60] just pray
[174.60] that may God keep the honor of all
the Muslims and all the parents safe.
[184.40] Amen. Amen.
[190.96] Bring the piping hot fried flatbread, my child.
[193.84] Keep it here.
[195.16] First let me eat the first one, and
you already brought the second one, yeah?
[204.76] Your honor,
[205.96] did you have your lunch?
[208.48] I was waiting for you,
[211.04] I was thinking we would have lunch
together when you come home.
[214.16] Hey, no, it wouldn’t be possible for me,
[216.72] actually, a delegation is here,
[218.76] I am also talking to you by taking out
some time from the meeting.
[221.56] If they hadn’t been waiting,
I would have definitely come.
[224.36] Hmm, no problem,
[226.72] you take your time and
attend the meeting,
[228.40] we will have lunch later together.
[230.76] But had you messaged me first,
I might have been able to manage.
[233.96] Hey, what happened?
[236.08] It’s just lunch and by the way,
[238.84] we will have dinner together anyway, right?
[241.00] We will have lunch together tomorrow
[243.52] but then do not schedule any meeting.
[246.04] Your wish is my command, sir.
[248.24] Okay, tell me,
[250.04] did you eat something or not?
[251.72] Yes, I had snacks an hour ago
[254.48] but you have your lunch,
[256.36] in fact, I will ask the chef myself,
[258.56] and he will serve your lunch in the room.
[261.40] Hey, what’s the need?
[262.92] I will ask him.
[264.04] Hey, you are the only owner of my love,
[267.92] I have to take care of you.
[274.04] I will ask him.
[276.32] if that satisfies you then do that.
[280.48] Okay, I will call you after the meeting.
[282.80] Then let’s plan to go out somewhere.
[286.08] Okay.
[288.52] I love you.
[289.56] Hmm?
[290.76] I love you.
[294.40] Bye.
[338.24] I have to work hard to get rich,
[342.96] come on, son, Sarfaraz,
[344.76] when you have had the courage till here,
[347.56] you will have it ahead as well.
[374.32] Yes, who do you want to meet?
[377.48] What should I say?
I don’t even know the name.
[380.88] I am shooting an arrow in the dark,
I will have to say something,
[385.12] I have to think of something.
[387.52] Say it?
[390.16] I want to meet Madam,
tell her Sarfaraz is here.
[394.40] Why do you want to meet her?
What do you want?
[398.36] I will tell that to her only.
[401.08] Wait.
[427.16] Hello?
[428.12] Greetings,
[429.28] madam, some mister wants to meet you.
[431.32] Who is it?
[432.40] And what’s the purpose of the meeting?
[434.56] Madam, he didn’t tell the purpose,
he is saying I will tell the purpose to Madam only.
[437.80] Did he tell his name?
[439.60] What did you say your name was?
[441.04] Sarfaraz.
[442.72] Madam, it is some Mr. Sarfaraz.
[450.72] Yes, madam, what should I say to him?
[457.28] Tell him I am busy and I can’t meet.
[460.92] Okay, fine. Okay, bye.
[475.48] Madam is busy she can’t meet you.
[478.56] Ask her to just meet me for 10 minutes.
[480.76] What did I say?
Madam is busy.
[483.60] Go away from here and listen,
don’t ring the bell again now.
[490.92] Go away.
[495.16] Come on, come on.
[544.52] Why did he come here?
[547.44] Did Fiza or anyone else
tell him about me?
[553.12] What if Ghaznavi and
others come to know that
[555.56] Sarfaraz is that person
[557.68] and who is now Fiza’s husband
and my brother-in-law?
[583.12] Get me a cup of tea.
[591.00] -Did you add sugar?
-Yes, sir.
[596.56] Oh, dude!
[606.08] Where did you go in the lunch break?
[608.96] I went for some work.
[611.20] What happened,
your mood seems off.
[615.20] My mood is off that is why it seems off.
[618.00] Is everything okay?
Tell me what happened.
[620.88] I guess you don’t trust me yet.
[625.60] You didn’t even tell me what happened
in the room the other day,
[627.96] the day Mr. Ghaznavi gave you
a notice for throwing the cheque,
[630.48] I thought you lost your job,
[632.88] or you would leave the job.
[634.56] You think I will leave this job myself?
[639.96] If I leave the job
who will break his ego?
[642.96] Ssshh,
[644.68] speak slowly, 
there are a lot of boss’ spies here.
[651.92] The camera might be observing us too.
[656.48] You can be scared if you want to,
[659.08] I just came back from his house.
[661.64] Whose house?
[662.92] Boss?
[667.48] But where did you get his address from?
[671.68] What do you think?
[673.24] Is it difficult to find out the addresses
of these rich people?
[682.00] The actual information
that I need is about his wife,
[685.96] that who is she?
[689.64] But she has also played
a different game with me,
[693.00] she said I am busy,
[695.52] I couldn’t meet her.
[697.32] What if the boss had seen you?
[703.08] What do you think, am I a kid?
[707.88] Boss and his lickspittle, Jaffar,
[710.16] they were in the office only,
that is why I went to his home.
[713.16] Listen,
[714.76] I don’t think anything
like that has happened,
[716.60] you are just saying all this to impress me.
[720.40] And you think I need to impress you?
[724.84] Okay, wait,
[726.16] even if I accept that you went there
[729.04] and had she come in front of you,
what would you do then?
[732.60] The actual game would have
started from there.
[736.16] I would have gone to him and said,
[738.64] look, my mother is not well,
my sister is a widow,
[746.48] the boss is firing me from my job,
and only you can save me.
[750.88] So, I have come here with
a commendation to you,
[753.68] but the boss shouldn’t know 
I came to you.
[756.20] And she would have listened to you?
[758.60] Yes, what’s the big deal in it?
[761.48] I can even melt a stone with my words,
[764.60] this is nothing.
[765.84] Okay, then?
[767.96] Then what?
[768.96] We would have started to talk from there
[771.32] and things would have led to a date
[774.88] and then everything would be mine.
[778.28] These rich people have a slight problem,
[782.68] they are rich
[784.28] but they are also a bit of
a fool along with that,
[787.04] they put everything in the name of their
wives to save themselves from income tax.
[793.72] Now when the wife is mine,
[797.00] the money becomes mine too.
[798.16] Brother, you have done PHD in fraud.
[801.48] How intelligent you are, 
I must admit.
[803.56] Whatever it is,
[805.36] if I had just met his wife today once,
[808.24] I would have found out 
if she is beautiful
[810.52] or would I have to memorize
a few forceful poetries for her.
[815.52] You are such a moron.
[818.40] That I am.
[833.24] When you are done with ironing,
[835.32] take this vegetable and cook it.
[839.64] You will learn to cook gradually.
[847.68] We also have to get you married
in the near future.
[851.28] Aren’t you guys too worried
about my marriage these days?
[855.28] It’s appropriate for young girls
to get married at the right time.
[860.52] I heard the conversation
between you and Dad.
[868.64] You guys want to get me married, right?
[874.40] Do you have any objection?
[877.28] No,
[879.28] even if I did have an objection,
it’s over after listening to you guys talk.
[885.44] Stay blessed.
[887.48] Parents always want good for their children.
[891.76] Just be careful about the fact
[897.92] the boy is good and rich
while you look for the proposal.
[903.20] How did you think of this?
[912.92] Why shouldn’t I, Mom?
[915.48] Am I not watching both
my sisters living their lives?
[921.44] Brother Sarfaraz does not
value Sister at all.
[928.72] He doesn’t have wealth,
[930.76] but the arrogance, it never ends.
[938.92] On the other hand,
look at Brother Nosherwan,
[942.60] he is also rich and he loves Sister crazily.
[949.12] My child, it’s all about fate.
[957.04] Dua had all of this in her fate.
[959.28] If that’s how it is then Mom,
I pray that my fate is not like Sister Fiza
[963.84] but sister Dua instead.
[997.36] I am sorry
I couldn’t come for lunch today,
[999.12] I was very busy.
[1006.20] Thank you.
[1011.20] Greetings, Mom.
[1015.64] When?
[1020.56] Why didn’t you inform me?
[1025.72] Yes, I am coming.
[1027.68] Yes, I will leave in a bit.
[1029.84] Bye.
[1034.36] Is everything okay?
[1035.72] Hmm?
[1037.20] Baba Saeein is not well,
[1038.60] he was hospitalized for a couple of days and,
now, he has come back home after insisting a lot.
[1042.40] These guys didn’t even tell me.
[1044.76] Don’t you worry,
[1046.84] everything will be fine.
[1050.88] Okay, I am going to the mansion,
[1053.96] you go to your mother’s house.
[1055.20] You will feel better.
What will you do here alone?
[1057.92] Hey, Baba Saeein is not well,
[1061.16] what will I do at Mom’s house?
[1063.80] I will also come along with you.
[1066.12] I will also get a chance to
take care of Baba Saeein.
[1070.60] Okay, let’s go.
[1072.12] Let me go change first.
[1073.32] Okay.
[1076.72] Yes, Jaffar, get the cars out.
[1130.40] Greetings.
[1131.40] Greetings. Stay blessed.
[1132.96] Greetings, Baba Saeein,
what happened?
[1146.16] -I am fine, son.
-Why didn’t you inform me?
[1149.32] You would have been
worried for no reason.
[1152.04] I am fine, I am fine.
[1158.64] I think, you must allow me,
[1160.08] I shall leave now
[1161.20] and I will complete the papers of
your will in a couple of days
[1164.00] and will come to you again.
[1172.08] If life gives me a chance,
[1174.48] we will meet again.
[1180.92] Yeah, sure, sure.
[1182.72] Bye.
[1189.56] Baba Saeein, what is the need for will?
[1196.60] Zawaar is no longer alive,
[1202.56] you have to take care of everyone after me.
[1219.32] Kashmala is here,
[1221.68] then there are kids
[1224.44] and Amma Saeein.
[1229.24] I hope
[1232.72] you will take very good care of them.
[1244.16] My child,
[1247.92] I don’t want to put a lot of burden
on you before I leave.
[1264.28] That is why I called the lawyer,
[1269.12] I want to give their shares to them
[1275.36] and leave peacefully.
[1287.56] Baba Saeein nothing will happen to you,
[1290.44] you have to look after all this.
[1292.56] What are you saying?
[1296.64] It’s my age now.
[1298.40] You are not that old yet.
[1301.00] Amma, tell him, what is he saying?
[1304.52] What should I tell?
[1306.32] Baba Saeein,
[1308.72] may God always keep
your shadow over us,
[1312.68] you have to live for very long.
[1321.00] Stay blessed, my child,
[1322.88] stay blessed.
[1330.12] The daughter-in-law has come
to the mansion for the first time,
[1334.96] is that how we will welcome her?
[1338.76] I didn’t notice because
I was worried for you.
[1342.48] I am not your daughter-in-law,
[1345.48] I am your daughter.
[1356.16] So, don’t worry,
[1358.44] nothing will happen to you.
[1361.92] I have been praying for you
throughout the way.
[1393.16] You go and listen to them now,
[1395.80] that is why I was telling you
not to get her married right now.
[1399.44] What would have I done
if not gotten her married?
[1402.08] Khizer is talking about taking out Sumbul
for dinner as her husband,
[1406.32] what if they weren’t married and
meeting somewhere behind our backs,
[1409.80] would that be better, or taking her out
after marriage is better?
[1416.88] No, for me, 
both of the things are wrong
[1419.36] and if you got her married,
[1421.12] you should have sent her with him as well.
[1423.08] Hey, Khizer has asked me for time,
[1425.00] he has his unmarried elder sisters at home,
[1427.16] would it look nice if he takes his wife
from here while they are still there?
[1435.32] Oh okay?
[1437.08] He doesn’t think of his elder sisters now
[1439.28] when he has been having lunches and
dinners after the marriage ceremony.
[1444.24] Hey I allowed him because as a husband
it was the first time he asked for my permission
[1449.32] though I didn’t find it appropriate as well.
[1452.64] Okay, so end of story then.
[1455.12] He is a man, no one will talk about him
[1457.80] but you have a daughter.
[1459.52] What will people see when she is seen
roaming around with him outside?
[1462.88] Won’t they talk about her?
[1464.28] Son, he is her husband.
[1467.12] I will have to listen to him once or twice,
[1469.00] I will have to give him permission but it’s fine,
[1471.00] if he asks for my permission next time,
I will refuse.
[1476.92] You don’t have to shout so much.
[1480.92] You don’t have to shout.
[1483.40] Mom, did you see how much
freedom he has given her?
[1486.92] I see it,
[1488.24] he said he would refuse,
[1491.84] don’t make so much noise now.
[1493.40] Oh, so I am making noise?
[1496.68] Okay, you must give freedom
to your daughter
[1498.32] but let me tell you,
[1499.72] when you guys will be regretting here
holding your heads and crying,
[1503.00] then I will ask you guys.
[1506.60] Yes, we will cry,
[1509.48] now you may go,
you have given me a headache.
[1520.04] Are you listening to our conversations
standing over here?
[1553.16] You will stay tonight, right?
[1555.04] Yes, Baba, Saeein, for sure.
[1557.20] We are here till you are completely well.
[1566.96] Stay blessed, my child,
[1568.84] stay blessed.
[1573.44] Baba Saeein, you shouldn’t have
discharged yourself from the hospital,
[1577.84] you don’t seem well to me.
[1582.12] Hey, son,
[1584.60] one can even die at the hospital,
[1595.16] if you are to stay alive,
[1597.92] nothing can happen to you
at home as well.
[1604.84] Why do you worry us all
by talking like this?
[1611.44] Okay, you don’t worry,
[1613.68] don’t worry,
[1615.28] I won’t die that soon.
[1627.80] Madam,
[1629.44] both kids were insisting
to come to Baba Saeein.
[1633.32] Let them come,
[1634.64] let my kids come to me.
[1636.72] Baba Saeein, they will irritate you
[1638.96] so I asked them not to come here.
[1643.88] You may go.
[1644.92] -Hey, my kids.
-What happened to you?
[1647.04] My love, nothing happened to me,
I am absolutely fine.
[1651.32] If you are absolutely fine,
then come play football with me, come.
[1654.96] Mizna cheats, anyway.
[1657.64] You are a cheater yourself.
[1658.96] No, son, don’t say like that.
[1661.72] How are you?
[1663.12] I am fine, uncle, how are you?
[1664.96] I am well.
[1667.88] Okay, both of you greeted Uncle,
but didn’t you see
[1672.92] Aunt has come along too?
[1676.80] Greet her.
[1678.08] Greetings, aunt.
[1679.72] Greetings.
[1681.68] Greetings.
[1683.24] How is she our Aunt?
[1685.84] Mom says that Uncle is our dad
[1689.80] so Dad’s wife would be Mom Jr, right?
[1716.72] What happened?
Did I say something wrong?
[1720.04] No.
[1816.24] Is Sumbul ready?
[1819.04] Yes, yes, I will call her.
[1820.68] -Okay.
-You have a seat first.
[1821.92] So sister-in-law, how are you?
[1824.56] I am well. How are you?
[1831.64] You must also ask about
the well-being of men.
[1839.12] I will ask the men
when they come in front.
[1850.36] What are you doing here?
[1854.16] Go call her.
[1858.56] Okay.
[1859.60] Will you have something?
[1860.68] Sister-in-law, just water.
[1862.04] Listen,
[1863.40] they are going out for food,
[1866.28] they can have it over there.
[1873.44] Go, bring her.
[1877.48] I will bring her.
[1881.28] Sit down.
[1906.08] Why are you looking at me like that?
[1908.68] I am looking at the fact that my sister-in-law
has started to glow after getting married.
[1915.36] Okay, lock this.
[1919.68] Make your Khizer do this now,
[1922.28] I have a lot of work of myself.
[1924.44] Sister-in-law?
[1926.28] Hey?
[1927.28] You are blushing and turning red.
[1930.64] Okay, come, let’s go,
Khizer is here.
[1934.52] He is here?
[1936.60] He hasn’t just come,
[1938.08] he has been desperately waiting for you.
[1940.28] Come.
[1941.60] Do I look okay?
[1942.88] You look very beautiful.
[1946.00] Khizer won’t be able to stop looking
at you if he sees you for once.
[1948.04] Come on, let’s go.
[1955.40] Look,
[1957.40] Dad has allowed you
to take her today but
[1962.04] consider it to be the first and last time
that he has allowed you.
[1967.80] Whatever I would want to say,
I will directly talk to Uncle regarding this.
[1974.60] At least, to understand him
or make him understand,
[1979.60] I wouldn’t have to work very hard.
[1986.36] I will come straight to the point
and say it in simpler words,
[1989.52] you must shut up while talking to me.
[1995.12] Look, no matter what you say
[1997.76] but you will have to talk to me.
[2002.96] And write this down,
[2005.28] you won’t get permission next time.
[2007.16] Why?
[2009.88] Where is it written on my face
that I am a goon?
[2016.68] Look, you cannot hide the reality
by wearing a police uniform?
[2022.80] What are you trying to say?
[2026.24] Okay,
[2028.08] look,
[2029.20] if you want to hear it, then hear it,
[2032.20] you think we trust you because
we allowed you to take her out to eat
[2037.88] and to let you come home?
Then that’s not how it is.
[2042.40] I guess you are forgetting that
your sister is now my wife.
[2046.80] Yes,
[2048.60] but that doesn’t mean we trust you.
[2053.00] You are insulting me.
[2054.52] So then tolerate it,
[2059.84] that poor girl is innocent what does
she know of the situation today?
[2069.36] People get married,
they get engaged
[2073.16] and a lot is happening behind it.
[2077.20] And we don’t trust at all that
[2081.00] you might not take her with you tomorrow
and just come and say that
[2083.80] this marriage is not happening,
what will we do then?
[2085.40] What kind of a person are you?
[2088.08] Aren’t you ashamed of saying
such pathetic things regarding your sister?
[2091.20] You must be ashamed,
[2093.24] you think we are fools?
[2097.28] You want to make her the limelight
of hotels in the name of dinner, right?
[2100.64] Shut up!
[2103.64] I have been listening to your
trash talk for very long now.
[2109.92] Look,
[2111.72] your brother is talking about
such pathetic things,
[2113.48] he is such a pathetic man.
[2114.60] -Who are you calling pathetic?
-Khizer?
[2117.44] Stop! Khizer?
[2122.92] Control your brother
[2125.20] and hats off to you,
in fact, I salute you
[2133.64] that you are bearing this animal-like man.
[2145.48] You are so hurt for her, right?
[2148.16] Then take her with you.
