[25.68] What is this trouble?
[27.24] Where is she?
[28.32] Hey, how would I know?
[30.72] Fiza.
[31.92] She must be dressing up to go to school.
[34.96] Hey,
[35.68] when she comes back 
from school herself,
[37.72] then let her go herself too.
[38.84] Why have you clung her on to me?
[40.36] Hey, it is your father’s orders.
[42.28] What do I say?
[45.12] Papa is just…
[46.76] He has given this girl undue importance.
[52.00] Fiza.
[54.28] Yes. Yes. I am here.
[55.64] I mean, should I do a job or
[57.00] should I act as her driver?
[58.40] What is this?
[59.56] When you know
[60.68] your husband has to go with you,
[62.08] that's when your antics start.
[68.56] No, it took me time to 
clean up the kitchen.
[70.76] Sorry.
[71.36] Okay, enough.
[72.24] No need to give your 
husband the impression
[74.32] that we make you 
do the work at home,
[76.08] and also a job.
[84.24] And yes,
[85.60] come home early,
[86.68] don't go sit with your mother.
[88.48] You know
[89.40] we have guests coming over,
[90.72] and we need to prepare everything.
[92.12] Yes. Yes, I will come straight home.
[94.44] And you.
[95.64] You too try to come early 
from the office as well.
[98.44] Brother Hassam is
 coming after a lot of years,
[100.20] I want us to give him a good gift.
[102.24] So, you go and bring a gift from the market.
[104.32] Also, take Fiza along.
[105.72] Yes, Mama, I will come.
[106.88] First, let me go.
[108.12] Come on,
[108.88] before she remembers some other work.
[110.52] Goodbye.
[111.84] Come straight home, okay?
[115.12] Lazy.
[128.84] Kashmala,
[132.32] what have you done to yourself?
[135.40] God forbid, what has happened
[138.40] that you don’t take care of yourself?
[146.96] You are young, you are beautiful
[154.80] and your husband is there with you.
[160.48] What do I care about, Amma Saeein?
[164.64] You, yourself say
[167.48] a wife is blessed if her husband likes her.
[174.48] Yes.
[177.40] That’s why we try to tell 
you again and again,
[180.48] that if you agree, then
[183.36] you don’t need to live like this.
[186.92] I can get you married somewhere else.
[192.48] Amma Saeein,
[195.88] I am not a sheep or a goat,
[200.40] that I am taken from one post 
and tied to another,
[205.68] and I don’t even feel anything.
[209.32] Kashmala,
[212.00] try to change your heart.
[214.64] I won’t be able to do it, Amma Saeein.
[218.08] It is not possible. I know.
[225.36] I am very ashamed.
[230.08] I repeatedly feel that 
we have made a huge mistake.
[238.16] If, after Zawar's departure,
[241.04] we hadn't bound you and 
Nosherwan in this relationship,
[247.04] perhaps today Nosherwan 
would be happy, and
[250.68] you would be mentally 
prepared for someone else.
[278.24] I don’t know about myself, Amma Saeein,
[282.88] but Nosherwan is really happy.
[285.92] He is really happy and 
his head is in the clouds.
[293.64] Yes.
[298.40] After marrying Dua,
[300.88] he started to seem really happy.
[303.96] That’s what I don’t 
understand, Amma Saeein,
[308.28] whether he is happy with Dua or
[311.72] because Farah returned.
[316.60] What is the need to
 mention Farah here?
[323.12] Farah has come back 
into Nosherwan’s life.
[331.24] He is with her all day long.
[335.08] You see for yourself.
[371.16] Hey, sister, you?
[373.52] How is my doll?
[374.80] I am fine, how are you?
[376.32] I am also absolutely fine.
[377.52] You tell me, Mama…
[379.32] Hey, you come in.
[383.52] Keep it here.
[391.24] Okay listen,
[392.12] you leave. When I need you to come,
[394.88] I will call you.
[396.20] Madam, sir told us not to leave
 you alone even for a moment.
[399.92] We are standing outside.
[400.80] You can stay for as long as you want.
[403.48] Fine, you can go.
[404.92] Yes, Madam.
[407.56] Come on, go close the door.
[414.04] Come quickly and talk to me.
[431.04] Hello.
[432.28] Hello.
[433.36] Ghaznavi, where are you?
[434.44] Please, come home immediately.
[437.04] Why? What happened?
[437.92] Is everything fine?
[439.08] Nothing is fine here.
[440.64] Ouch, my foot.
[442.64] What has happened?
[445.24] Actually, I fell in the washroom and
[448.04] I feel that I fractured my foot.
[452.48] Okay, don’t worry. I am coming.
[454.56] Please come home quickly.
[455.96] It hurts a lot. I cannot tolerate it.
[458.44] I am coming. I am coming.
[468.20] Take the car to Farah’s home,
[469.96] she got hurt.
[499.72] What's the matter, sister?
[501.24] Seeing your style makes me envious.
[503.64] You are living a life fit for a princess.
[506.88] You will see,
[508.00] you will get married in 
a really good family.
[511.68] Sania,
[512.88] who are you talking to?
[514.52] It is me, Mama.
[515.76] Greetings.
[516.96] Greetings.
[518.48] How is my child?
[519.60] I am fine.
[522.16] How are you?
[523.44] I saw you, I met you, so I am good.
[526.84] Have a seat.
[528.48] Sister, what do we do with all this?
[531.92] What do we have to do with it?
[532.96] We will eat, drink, we will enjoy a lot.
[536.48] I am here all day long today.
[539.00] Yes, child. Surely stay.
[540.68] This is your own home.
[542.36] But what was the need for all this?
[544.44] Why was there no need?
[545.96] It is my own home, right?
[547.48] So, can I not bring it?
[549.00] And if you tell me not to, 
then I will get upset.
[551.04] Hey, no, no,
[551.84] I am not telling you not to,
[553.84] don’t get upset.
[555.24] Okay, tell me, what will you eat?
[558.80] Mama, feed me whatever you
 have cooked at home.
[561.04] I am really hungry.
[563.36] We have sliced beef,
[564.60] your favourite.
[566.88] Sliced beef?
[568.44] Quickly go and bring it.
[569.60] See, I started drooling hearing about it.
[571.44] I know you cannot tolerate hunger.
[573.56] I will bring it.  
Yes, fine. Go.
[576.20] Mama,
[577.04] will Papa come in the evening?
[579.40] Yes, child,
[580.48] he has the same routine.
[582.56] I am so happy,
[584.48] God answered my prayers.
[585.88] My daughter is in front 
of my eyes today.
[615.36] Uncle, we will not let you go anywhere.
[616.96] Yes.
[617.64] Let your uncle go.
[619.20] Someone is waiting for him there.
[621.16] Who is waiting, uncle?
[623.48] The one who is dearest to them, 
more than me, you, and anyone.
[630.48] It's inappropriate that you say 
these things in front of the children.
[633.44] And what about what you did
[635.60] bringing her between you and me?
[638.60] There was never anything between us,
[640.96] that you are so bothered
 with someone coming in between.
[644.92] For a moment, let's say I accept
[647.68] that Ghaznavi will leave me now
 that Farah has come back.
[651.36] But have you ever thought
[654.32] that even then,
[656.24] there will be no place for 
you in Ghaznavi's heart?
[659.28] Thousands like you and 
Farah come and go.
[663.00] I am there forever.
[664.92] And don’t forget
[666.60] that I am talking to you sitting in 
the mansion of Nosherwan’s parents.
[670.80] What value does that mansion have
[673.08] where you get nothing but loneliness?
[677.80] Seeing you in this role after
 seeing you as a sister-in-law
[681.04] will be nothing short of a test for me.
[688.20] If you want,
[689.76] you can say no to this wedding.
[704.44] Assuming this marriage happens,
[708.48] you will indeed be in my marriage,
[714.84] and I will fulfill your rights as a wife,
[727.36] but don't expect love from me.
[742.20] Farah.
[743.36] Dua.
[744.44] Dua.
[745.48] Farah.
[746.32] I am nowhere.
[748.32] I am nowhere at all.
[750.44] I am nowhere.
[759.08] What happened? How did you fall?
[761.08] Show me.
[761.56] Did you get hurt badly?
[764.36] I lost my balance,
[766.92] I couldn’t steady myself and fell.
[769.76] So be careful.
[775.00] I will call the doctor.
[776.28] The doctor visited and left, and
[779.12] he has prescribed these tests and X-rays.
[785.40] Then you should go to the hospital.
[790.76] Hey, what if you have a serious injury?
[792.04] What are you doing here?
[795.08] I didn’t have the strength.
[797.52] Where is Bano?
[798.92] Bano.
[800.96] At least, she should have 
called me and informed me,
[802.76] or she should have 
at least informed Jaffar.
[804.60] She went home to meet her family.
[806.44] And you are alone at home 
and you are telling me now?
[809.88] How could I tell you?
[812.20] Your phone is always off.
[814.40] Farah, how will it work like this, man?
[816.52] My phone will be off, often.
[818.08] At times I am in meetings, 
at times I am working.
[823.36] You will have to take 
care of yourself.
[825.12] You will have to manage 
things yourself, now.
[827.28] I cannot.
[833.60] You are there to care for me.
[841.16] After all, I get really 
alone without you.
[854.60] Come on, I will take
 you to the hospital.
[856.52] It is necessary to 
get these tests done.
[875.32] Careful.
[880.04] What happened?
[883.84] Now if you want to help me,
[886.64] do it properly.
[896.88] Come on.
[898.40] Ouch.
[902.48] Careful.
[907.16] I have to do so much to call
 you to me again and again.
[912.52] A day will come
[914.04] when I will even break Dua's spell.
[916.96] Then you will only be mine.
[924.28] I had fun, Mama.
[925.56] That’s it. No. No. No.
[926.40] My stomach is full.
[928.08] Tea is here.
[929.44] Now all of us will enjoy it together.
[931.68] Wow,
[933.52] our little one has
 become really skilled.
[935.92] Thank you.
[937.76] I had to be.
[939.20] After all, I was alone after you 
and sister Fiza left.
[953.84] Mama doesn’t stay well either,
[956.92] and Papa’s anger.
[963.44] You know how afraid I am of Papa.
[968.32] It was a very difficult time for us.
[976.52] Anyway,
[978.60] that time was bad for everyone.
[986.84] Hey, child,
[988.88] instead of being sad about
 past events, it’s better
[994.04] to be grateful for today’s happiness.
[1001.60] You are right.
[1004.36] I never thought
[1007.08] I would sit with you all, 
between you all again, like this.
[1014.16] We should never lose hope in God.
[1017.84] He is capable of turning every
 impossibility into a possibility.
[1021.88] No doubt.
[1023.96] The good thing is that 
all of us are together
[1026.40] and we are really happy.
[1032.52] Except for sister Fiza.
[1039.52] Why?
[1041.56] What happened to Fiza?
[1043.32] Her in-laws are not good at all.
[1046.08] Uncle and Sumbul
 can still be tolerated,
[1049.04] but Aunty and 
Brother Groom are incompatible.
[1062.48] Sister has a lot of tolerance.
[1066.36] They say so much but still, 
she never complains.
[1070.04] What is their problem?
[1071.40] Fiza is so good.
[1073.20] After you left the house,
[1074.76] if anyone suffered beside us,
[1077.24] it’s Sister Fiza.
[1082.64] They taunted her so much that 
they made her life difficult.
[1086.80] If they find out that 
you’ve returned to us,
[1090.48] they might even end 
her interactions with us.
[1095.04] Sania.
[1099.40] No Mama, let her speak.
[1107.68] I too should hear
[1109.84] why my sister is getting
 punished for my mistakes.
[1119.76] This…
[1120.80] this is nothing, sister.
[1124.16] Brother Groom had also 
threatened sister with divorce.
[1135.20] When you and I were going
 to become Aunts, then
[1137.68] brother groom put such 
bad allegations on sister,
[1140.68] that…
[1142.16] I think that sister didn’t fall herself,
[1145.12] she was made to fall on purpose.
[1152.92] Enough.
[1156.60] Mama, so much happened with Fiza,
[1158.76] and you didn’t tell me.
[1160.36] To the extent, that even
 Fiza didn’t say anything.
[1162.04] Why?
[1164.00] Our Fiza is really patient.
[1174.00] What could I tell you?
[1176.00] And child, even if I had told you,
[1177.48] her loss wouldn’t have
 been redeemed.
[1186.52] My daughter had the sorrow
 of a child in her fate,
[1195.72] so it happened.
[1199.48] Whatever happened,
[1200.68] happened because of her in-laws.
[1210.40] Okay, you have tea.
[1211.60] It is getting cold.
[1217.20] You tell me,
[1218.36] where are you going?
[1220.32] I am going home right now.
[1223.60] You…
[1225.52] you didn’t quit your school job?
[1227.52] No.
[1230.64] What happened to you?
[1232.68] Nothing.
[1233.76] I was a little unwell,
[1235.12] but I am fine now. I am absolutely fine.
[1236.76] How will you go?
[1238.80] I will drop you home.
[1239.84] No. No. No.
[1241.20] We will talk and meet later.
[1244.00] Okay, come on, give me your number.
[1245.40] No,
[1246.04] I don’t have a number,
[1247.24] I don’t even have a phone, Dua.
[1306.16] Greetings.
[1307.44] Hey, why did you do all this?
[1309.36] I would have come and served food.
[1311.20] Anyway,
[1311.96] I am done eating, ask Sumbul.
[1315.08] Sumbul works so hard
 and cooks food just for you.
[1318.72] So that when sister-in-law comes
[1319.80] she doesn’t have to work hard again.
[1321.48] She cares for you so much,
[1323.32] so it is also your responsibility
 to take care of her.
[1327.08] Sure.
[1327.80] Feed her food,
[1328.76] she was saying she is not hungry.
[1330.08] Yes, I will do one thing,
[1332.16] I will dish out her food along with mine.
[1333.88] We will both eat together.
[1335.80] Fine.
[1336.88] And listen.
[1339.84] Nothing should be left lacking
 with regard to tomorrow.
[1344.40] Nothing will be left lacking.
[1346.12] Hmm. And.
[1348.52] And lay out the bed sheet 
we had laid out on your wedding.
[1352.64] And also take out the new crockery.
[1355.48] Yes, sure.
[1356.84] And yes,
[1358.40] I had spoken to you regarding the food,
[1361.32] that the entire feast will be prepared.
[1363.68] It should include biryani,
[1365.08] korma, kebabs, raita, salad,
[1367.96] and all the accompaniments.
[1369.80] We spoke about all this yesterday
[1371.56] and I had noted everything down.
[1373.32] Hey,
[1374.16] what will I do with you noting it?
[1376.36] You don’t have to note it.
[1377.84] Make a list and give it to me,
[1379.28] so that I can get the things.
[1381.64] And after all,
[1382.88] Sarfaraz got a new job,
[1384.92] I cannot make him take a day 
off from the office, right?
[1387.76] You have to take care of everything.
[1390.48] Yes.
[1391.32] I will take care of everything.
[1393.04] And yes, listen.
[1397.24] I see a lot of webs on the roof.
[1401.72] Clean them today,
[1403.08] and don't postpone 
today's work to tomorrow.
[1405.40] Understood?
[1408.64] Sure.
[1409.36] And yes, listen to me.
[1412.20] Yes?
[1414.32] Don’t tire Sumbul out by making
 her work alongside you.
[1417.96] On such occasions,
[1420.24] it’s the sisters-in-law
[1421.80] who take charge and 
manage everything actively.
[1424.68] Alright?
[1426.16] And one more thing—
[1428.48] praise Sumbul a lot
 in front of the guests.
[1432.80] Understood?
[1434.64] Obviously,
[1436.16] Sumbul is so good.
[1437.68] She is like my younger sister.
[1439.40] That’s the thing.
[1440.76] What I’m saying is that
[1442.68] you should repeatedly
 mention in front of them
[1445.08] that Sumbul takes great care of you,
[1447.84] loves you very much,
[1449.16] and treats you like a sister.
[1450.76] She is such a friendly and lovely child.
[1453.84] You need to say all this.
[1456.64] Yes. Sure.
[1458.28] Should I give Sumbul food, first?
[1461.04] If you allow me, then can I leave?
[1464.88] Yes, so leave.
[1465.84] When have I tied you here?
[1467.68] Go.
[1468.84] Sure.
[1483.20] You have brought all 
this to my attention
[1486.76] and forced me to think about it.
[1492.28] I had no other option but
 to bring it to your attention.
[1496.56] The matter is really very complicated.
[1502.88] Earlier, it was just Kashmala,
[1505.72] but now it is a matter 
of two daughters-in-law.
[1510.88] I don’t understand
[1513.52] what Nosherwan wants.
[1516.44] That’s what you have to 
ask him calling him here.
[1519.96] Fine.
[1521.36] He didn’t like Kashmala,
[1523.92] he married her on us forcing him.
[1529.84] Despite our opposition,
[1532.20] he embraced the new girl with his love.
[1538.44] Then what has happened that 
despite both of them being present,
[1543.52] he turned his attention towards Farah?
[1547.48] Saeein, I am really angry at Nosherwan.
[1556.00] I didn’t expect this from him at all.
[1558.04] Even I didn’t expect this from him.
[1560.24] That’s why I am not able to believe 
what you have told me till now.
[1564.60] You believing it, or not believing
 it won't change the reality.
[1570.44] And that girl Farah?
[1572.88] I didn’t like her from the start.
[1575.44] Call Nosherwan and ask him
[1577.88] what he is up to.
[1580.72] Make him understand
[1582.80] that this Farah is not right for him at all.
[1585.04] She is a really cunning girl.
[1587.20] She will sell our son and 
he will not even find out.
[1589.68] After all,
[1590.48] how can someone harm our son?
[1597.80] But, I…
[1601.04] I will talk to him
[1602.92] and understand what he ultimately wants.
[1605.72] This time,
[1607.28] you won’t just talk or be lenient.
[1613.04] You’ll need to be strict .
[1622.24] On one hand,
[1624.08] Kashmala is sitting with a burning heart,
[1626.12] and now Dua?
[1629.04] The blame will fall on our upbringing
[1631.36] since I am the mother of Nosherwan.
[1633.20] Why should we be the ones
 to bear the curse of two girls?
[1637.00] Alright.
[1638.20] Please don’t upset yourself.
[1641.16] I told you I would talk to Nosherwan.
[1644.64] And if he acts out of line this time,
[1649.68] we will handle him strictly.
[1660.68] This is the limit.
[1715.92] Sumbul.
[1717.56] Sumbul.
[1718.56] Sister-in-law, why did you bring the food?
[1720.12] Hey,
[1721.76] I am really hungry.
[1723.12] Come on, we will eat together.
[1724.40] Come on.
[1724.96] I am not hungry.
[1727.36] Why?
[1730.16] I am noticing that
[1731.80] since Uncle mentioned 
the arrival of Fahad's family,
[1735.40] your hunger and thirst have vanished.
[1738.68] Look,
[1740.96] it happens with every girl.
[1745.88] Hearing about in-laws 
makes her heart very sad.
[1750.48] Obviously,
[1751.40] there’s a deep sorrow in 
leaving one’s own family.
[1756.84] I am really scared, Sister-in-law.
[1760.88] Why are you scared?
[1762.56] We will only proceed with the proposal 
after thoroughly assessing the boy.
[1766.88] Besides,
[1767.76] he is a friend of Uncle.
[1769.36] We know him.
[1770.16] Why are you worried?
[1775.80] You somehow find a way to cancel 
the plan of this proposal coming over.
[1780.88] Why, Sumbul?
[1783.96] I don’t want to get married right now.
[1787.16] Right now,
[1788.24] they are only coming with the proposal.
[1790.68] You will not get married immediately.
[1797.84] I don’t want to go so far.
[1799.72] Hey, girls dream of having
[1801.32] their marriage proposals 
come from England or Europe,
[1803.40] so they can proudly 
tell their friends that
[1805.28] after marriage,
[1806.12] they’ll be settling in America or England.
[1807.96] I have never had such a desire.
[1814.32] What is the matter, Sumbul?
[1819.12] What would be the matter?
[1822.52] There must be a reasonable 
reason behind your refusal.
[1826.68] The only reason is that
[1828.16] I don't want to get married right now and
[1830.44] I don't want to go so far.
[1834.28] This is not that big a reason.
[1836.72] No one will agree.
[1843.92] Look Sumbul,
[1845.76] you can talk to me about anything.
[1854.12] Whatever is there in your heart, say it.
[1856.92] You can trust me.
[1861.60] Sister-in-law, I…
[1865.48] Yes?
[1870.44] Are you still not done eating?
[1877.76] You know there is 
a feast tomorrow, right?
[1879.16] There is so much work to be done.
[1881.00] Yes, we were just eating.
[1882.56] Finish your food, quickly,
[1884.16] then come to me.
[1888.16] Sure.
[1889.20] This is the limit.
[1890.28] They are having a party,
[1892.00] and they are not worried at all.
[1896.48] You please eat this.
[1897.72] I will come, okay?
[1918.80] You should have informed 
Jaffar before going on leave.
[1921.52] Sir, Madam…
[1922.40] Leave it, Ghanznavi.
[1926.04] She too has to meet her family.
[1931.32] And, after all,
[1935.00] how was she to know
 that I would fall?
[1938.24] She has been hired
 here to take care of you.
[1944.32] Yes, so she cares for me.
[1951.72] You go to the kitchen and 
make arrangements for dinner.
[1958.56] You are not fine, anyway.
[1960.68] A little negligence 
will make this a big issue.
[1965.20] Nothing can happen to me with you here.
[1968.88] I am leaving.
[1970.52] I am getting late.
[1971.68] Wait.
[1973.56] Have dinner with me today.
[1976.92] No, not today, some other time.
[1978.48] Today.
[1987.16] Bano is making dinner,
[1989.36] you are having dinner with me.
[1993.84] Why are you insisting?
[1995.04] I am explaining something to you.
[1999.24] You find my wish to be my insistence?
[2007.76] Then let it be my insistence.
[2016.12] If you go from here today,
[2018.12] I will not eat anything.
[2023.44] Neither food nor medicine.
[2028.92] And you know well 
how stubborn I am.
[2036.36] Farah what is this childish behaviour?
[2042.88] Please grow up.
[2072.04] Here.
[2074.64] Take care of yourself too.
[2077.24] You are there to take care of me.
[2082.24] You will have to take care of yourself.
[2083.88] You will have to manage 
things yourself, now.
[2085.76] I cannot.
[2088.08] You are there to care for me.
[2091.52] After all, I get really alone without you.
[2097.36] What happened?
[2098.88] Where did you get lost?
[2100.24] Huh?
[2101.84] No, nowhere.
[2106.40] Nowadays,
[2107.28] you have started to stay really lost.
[2112.76] Is it work-related stress?
[2118.52] Yes, I am just a little busy.
[2121.76] You came late,
[2123.76] even last night and then you
 slept without having dinner.
[2127.12] No, I had food with friends.
[2129.16] Aren’t friends starting to take on
 too much importance in your life?
