Isn’t Dua meeting her brother-in-law 
a lot these days? Any special reason behind it? I am surprised, Nosherwan, she started showing her true colors as soon as you disappeared 
from the public view. Tell me one thing, do you ignore the mistakes of 
your second wife like you ignore me? Where did you get these pictures from? I had to get them made, otherwise you wouldn’t have 
believed me without proof. Nosherwan, you mistook 
a wildflower for a lotus, picked it up from the dirt, 
and decorated it on your collar. You must realize it yourself, that girl is not worth it, Nosherwan. You have become very famous, and lots of news are 
spreading about you. What news? Exactly what you have hidden from me. I didn’t hide anything from you. You are expecting a baby and almost the entire city knows but you didn’t bother telling me. I haven’t told anyone yet. Then how does the entire city know? I don’t know, I didn’t tell anyone, I even went to the doctor with my mom. Oh, so that means you have also
 visited the doctor already? And I am still unaware, wow. I tried telling you but 
you weren’t in a good mood. Yeah, so you won’t tell me anything
if I am in a bad mood? I tried but… Who told you this? No one knows it except my mom. Oh! So, what do you think I won’t find out anything if you don’t tell me
 or your mother does not tell me. When did I say that? Hmm. Your family is already hiding 
a lot from me these days. What? I will tell you when it’s the time. Why didn’t you tell me that 
you were coming to the office? Surprise. How come you are here? I came to meet Sarfaraz. I didn’t get it. He is my brother-in-law, Fiza’s husband. Fiza’s husband? It was just yesterday that I found out that he is an employee in your company, so I thought I’d meet him as well
now that I am here. He doesn’t like meeting us. Why did you send the guards
and the driver back? People get worried and 
there is no space here as well, I don’t like it when the poor people 
are standing outside in the sun. I wasn’t expecting Sarfaraz for Fiza. It was Sarfaraz who had an objection 
to meeting you, right? Where did his objection go now? 
He is still my employee, though I thought he would quit 
this job after knowing the truth, but that didn’t happen. Let’s see. What happened? 
Did he say something? Did he misbehave? No, no, what would he say to me? He got quiet when 
he saw me as your wife. Nosherwan, you mistook 
a wildflower for a lotus, picked it up from the dirt, 
and decorated it on your collar. You must realize it yourself, that girl is not worth it, Nosherwan. Fiza? Dua, you please don’t come outside, okay? Why? You just, you just go and hide somewhere. Have you gone mad, why? Sarfaraz is outside. So? He doesn’t know you are back, it would be very bad for me 
if he finds out, please. Nothing bad will happen. Please hide, please. Why should I hide? For my sake, please hide. You don’t know Sarfaraz. Fiza? Yes? I was going to the office, I thought of informing you. How are you? I am in front of you. He is an employee 
at Nosherwan’s company, I have already met him, didn’t you tell her? Yes, I didn’t get a chance to tell Fiza that we know each other. I mean to say that we have already met each other before. She is the wife of my boss, so I met her there. Anyway, you didn’t even want to tell me, I saw her here and found out that 
she is Dua and she has returned. Anyway, I will leave now, I am getting late for the office, Boss is also not here 
these days by the way, he is out of the city so the workload has increased. Bye. He already met you before and he didn’t even create 
a fuss about it, how did that happen? Status. Status keeps a person’s tongue 
as a possession. The situation would have been different if it was an ordinary girl standing in front 
of him instead of his Boss’ wife. It’s different today. I thought all hell would break loose when 
he finds out about you and when he sees you. Sarfaraz didn’t do anything. He can’t do anything. Hmm, don’t be scared, hmm? Come, let’s go outside. The members of the meeting 
have started to come, there is a meeting in the board room
in 15 minutes and then lunch. Hmm. Jaffar, actually… Yes, sir? I need all the information 
about Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz? What is it? You've never been shocked by 
anything I've said before like this. What is so special about Sarfaraz, sir? Tell me openly what is it? No, actually Madam also asked me
to get information about him, and today you are saying so. It means there is something
special about him. When did Dua ask you to do so? A few days ago,
I told her that Sarfaraz works in your company so she was very surprised, then she told me he is her brother-in-law. But Madam asked me not to 
tell you all this. She was saying maybe 
it’s some family matter. When the family didn’t introduce them then how did Dua find out that 
Sarfaraz is her brother-in-law? Yeah, that I don’t know. That is what I am asking you to find out. But one more thing, sir, a few days ago, 
Sarfaraz also came home and Madam especially told the watchman
that no one should find out about it. I need complete information 
about both of them. Whatever you say, sir. I will leave now. It means what I figured out was right, they know each other from before. It feels so nice that we are all together after so long. Hmm, really. Thank God that He united us again. And to be honest, I used to miss Dua 
very much on every occasion. Now I am with you guys. Forever, my child, forever. For how long can the river 
stay away from the sea? Yeah? You had to come back to us and I am very happy 
that you are back. Oh! I left the tap open, my child,
I will be back in a minute. He is very happy today. Bad days have passed, everything will be good now. By the way, I am surprised by 
Brother Sarfaraz’s behavior, he didn’t do any drama 
when he saw Sister. Tell me about it, how surprised I was. I was so scared. Yeah, by the way, both of you are right. The way sister Kausar and Sarfaraz 
had made Dua their practice of cruelty, I didn’t think that they won’t
publicize this matter. By the way, how did Brother Sarfaraz change 
so much, Sister? I am very surprised myself. Dua told me that Sarfaraz works 
at Brother Nosherwan’s office, so this must be the reason. You are right, otherwise, Sarfaraz is not so nice 
that he would stay quiet. It means that Brother Nosherwan 
should be praised for this as well, a person like Brother Sarfaraz was 
speechless because of his power. Hey, haven’t you started talking big lately? I am saying what’s true, 
Mom, right, Sister? Come, Brother Sarfaraz, come. Come. What is it? Don’t you greet people? Greetings. -Sit, I will call Fiza. 
-Hey, why do you need to go? 
You sit down. Sania will tell her, and I have met you very little anyway. My child, go and tell Fiza 
that I am here, ask her to make a good cup of tea,
and then get ready to go, yeah? Meanwhile, let me put in 
a request for my promotion. She is the lady boss, Ghaznavi might agree 
if I ask her for it. Sit down. Why so rude that you don’t even
want to talk to me? Those days aren’t very old right now, we used to talk on the phone
with each other, and you used to wait for my calls. Shut! Shut your mouth! By the way, you can still wait for me if you want. I will break your face 
if you say a word more. Is it that easy? Yes. You are still the same, you haven't changed a lot. You immediately get angry. You are my sister’s husband, you should be ashamed. Ashamed? Why ashamed? In fact, I consider myself fortunate 
that both the sisters… Greetings. You immediately made the tea? Yes, I kept it on the stove as soon as 
I heard the sound of your bike. Look, your sister takes such good care of me. My sister is very nice, she takes care of everyone, I wish you would have 
also taken care of her. Anyway, you guys sit, I will be right back. No, no, just don’t add sugar, I will have it as is. -Greetings, Brother. 
-Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. What is it? Aren’t you inclining a little too much
towards your wife these days? You also took her to her parents’ house
in the morning and now you are also bringing 
her back after the office, hmm? Fiza, didn’t you tell Mom that 
your sister has returned? Sister who? That Dua? Yes, Mom, Dua. None of your other sisters ran away, right? Dua, she is back. Didn’t you tell Mom? Why would she tell? 
She is so cunning, wouldn’t she get blisters on her mouth? It’s surprising that such people keep the sisters back, 
who ran away. How did you take her to meet her sister? And you didn’t bother telling us, hmm? At last, you have become like your wife. Hey, by the way, it’s very sad that you don’t know your son, 
what do you think I will just become like anyone,
you think I am that weak? So then how did you 
take her to meet her? You used to hate dropping her 
off at her parents’ house. What can I say, 
I have to do it, it is due to some compulsions. What compulsion? Madam Dua has become 
a very rich lady, she is the wife of my boss. Hunh? She directly trapped your boss after 
coming out of the police station? Such girls are very gutsy, Mom, otherwise how come every man would 
make utmost effort to praise her? Yes, and that is the reason why 
you see me working so hard, it is because of this. I will lose my job 
if she complains about me. I don’t know how did you get there 
or why did you get there, and I don’t even want to know but it’s different if you want to 
tell me something yourself. I trusted an ill-bred, I don’t have anything more to tell you. Do you want him to get to 
your knees and apologize? Just tell me his name and identity once, and after that, you can give him 
whatever punishment you want. No, I don’t want to have any relationship 
with any memory of my past. Jaffar, you got very late. Sometimes to explain 
the most difficult things of life, we have to be late on purpose, Sir. No matter how bitter the truth is, I am ready to listen to it. Your doubt was right, sir. Sarfaraz and Madam knew 
each other from before. Tell me in detail. Sir, Sarfaraz was behind everything 
that happened to Madam. They used to love each other. The night when Sarfaraz had his wedding, he went to Aunty’s flat and sold Madam
on the same evening. I was praying that my suspicion
proves to be wrong but look… Sir, you control yourself. I am fine, Jaffar. For the first time in my life, I felt like lying to you and giving you
false information, sir, so you don’t have to go through 
the pain you are going through. The truth reveals itself someday, Jaffar. Why did Madam hide it from you that Sarfaraz is that person? Only your madam can answer this. You may leave, Jaffar. But Sir… I am fine, Jaffar, you may go. Okay, sir. I came to meet Sarfaraz. He is my brother-in-law, Fiza’s husband. Fiza’s husband? It was just yesterday that I found out that he is an employee in your company, so I thought I’d meet him as well 
now that I am here. Ghaznavi hasn’t responded 
since last night, he never ignores my calls. Dua? My child, when is Ghaznavi coming back? Why? Are you tired of me? No, I am just asking. I don’t know, I was also calling him to ask this. Is everything all right? Did you guys fight? Fight? Ghaznavi never fights. He must be busy, don’t you worry. May God bring him back safely. Amen. Ghaznavi has to come back today so I was thinking to go back home. Why, my child? What will you do alone at home? Go back with him when he is here. That would be fine too. Okay, I will go offer prayers, it’s time. Listen, pray for me. I always pray for you. Sir, we have our flight back home 
in the evening today. Get it canceled. Okay, so, for when should I get the next one? I will tell you when I plan to go back. Madam is calling me again and again. Listen to what she wants to say. Okay. Greetings, Madam. Greetings. Thank God you attended my call otherwise, Ghaznavi is 
not picking up my call. Yes, he is in a meeting. Umm, you guys have
your flight today, right? No, madam, it’s not confirmed yet. Okay, make me talk to Ghaznavi 
when he gets free from the meeting. Okay, sure. Bye. Bye.
