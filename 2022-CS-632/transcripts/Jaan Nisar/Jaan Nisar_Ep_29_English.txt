Do you still not trust me? I trust you the most. Then what is the reason
for getting scared? Now, if I have any fear,
then that is of losing you. I had gotten scared, that you might leave me. This will never happen. Trust me. I have just started to trust. If something like this happens, then my existence will be erased. I will not let it get erased. This is my promise to you. You have no idea that Nosherwan
used to love Farah like crazy. And when Farah is no longer there, then, how can you always remain? Do I seem like someone
who would change to you? I don’t know, but now I have started to be afraid. When I am with you,
then what are you afraid of? Kausar. Kausar. Where are you? Kausar. What happened?
Why are you so angry? Call and tell your son to come home
immediately, wherever he is. What did my son do now? What did he do? He's determined to ruin
the entire family's honor. There. Sarfaraz is here. You ask him. Tell us, what is the matter? What are you asking me? Ask him. But, what do I have to ask him?
Tell me this. Why are you standing quietly?
Answer her. Hey, tell me. What is the matter?
What has happened? Nothing. I don’t know why he is talking like this. Nothing happened? If nothing happened,
then who was that girl? Hey, I am ashamed to say this and
you are saying nothing happened. Girl? Which girl? Ask him why he's out having fun with girls
instead of coming home after work. He has a young sister
and wife at home, yet he chooses to develop
relationships with other girls. Why don’t you tell us,
who was that girl? Which girl were you with? Hey, so what sin did I commit? She was my friend,
so can I not meet her? You were so informal with her? What you call familiarity was
considered so in your time. Nowadays, it's all normal. Indecency remains indecency in any era. And remember, I am your father,
not the other way around, so don't try to lecture me. Well, you understand
what you want to do. But don't question me like
I'm some criminal or thief. You insolent... What are you doing? Raising your hand on a grown man?
What's gotten into you? Discipline your grown-up child. Explain to him that with a wife at home, he shouldn't be making friends
with other girls outside. I didn't even want to keep a wife. Are you hearing this? Are you hearing what he just said...
Hey. Hey. Mama, leave it. Raise it…
raise your hand at me today. I will make him understand. I am telling you
I will make him understand. Let him do it. I too will see how much he will hit me. I say, leave.
Go to your room. I will just call Mr. Aslam and I will tell him to come and
take his daughter from here. She has no value in this home. Surely call him. You will be doing me a favor on me. I will do him a favor. I will… You…. Ill-mannered. Disgraceful. Stop it. You come on.
Come, sit. Sit here. Hey, I don’t want to sit. Hey, come on.
For God’s sake. Don’t ruin your health.
Come on, come sit. Sit. Sumbul. Sumbul, bring water. Okay, Mama. Why are making your blood pressure high? Where are you going? To the room. Why? You should have waited
for me a little longer. I had gotten tired. Already? I can wait for you all my life. I just got a little tired right now. I am sorry, I got a little late. Being late is not the issue. Just never forget your way home. Till I believe that you are waiting for me at home, then I will not go anywhere. I will always return home. I will be waiting. He's doing wrong and on top of that,
he's being defiant. There's no shame or
modesty left in his eyes. Why are you getting so worked up? I made a mistake.
I made a very big mistake. That you married your useless son
and I let it happen. You have gotten after him. He was saying she was his friend. You can believe him, I cannot. I have decided,
I will just call Brother Aslam and tell him everything. After that, I will accept whatever
he decides for his daughter. I don’t understand, why do you want to reveal
your son’s character to the world? And especially in front of the people, whose daughter has no character. It is the thinking of women like you. Children like Sarfaraz are born
to women who think like this. Hey, before you make an allegation
about someone else’s daughter, think that you too have a daughter. Hey, what is the comparison of
my daughter with these people? My daughter is one in a million.
One in a million. And son? What do you think about him? You always get worked up
over every little thing. That’s it. That’s it. I have decided. I will call Brother Aslam right now,
I will put the entire reality in front of him. Uncle, please don’t call Papa. Please. But child, your life, your happiness, everything is dependent on this. You just don’t involve Papa. I will talk to Sarfaraz myself,
I will take care of him. Yes. Yes. She is right. This is the husband and
wife’s personal matter. Why are you getting involved? Okay, fine, child. I will not call your father. But don’t consider yourself alone. I am here. I am present in place of your father. Stay happy. Did you see it? That’s what daughters
who have good upbringings are like. And then there is your son, useless. Hey, tell him to learn to live like a human. Good girl. She is cunning. Cunning. Mama, you please drink some water. Hello. Your number is always switched off. When you understood my number will be off, why are you wasting your time? I found you through a stroke of luck, I cannot lose you again and again. Searching for something you lost
at the same place is stupidity. You leave the benefit and loss to me. You calling me again and again
is disturbing me. Okay, at least you admitted that
you still think about me. You are just wasting your time. Agree to stand by me once, everything will be fine. I have work to do. Ghaz… You cannot run from me like this. Who was that girl? I have answered outside. Did you not hear it there that
you came here to bother me? I want to hear the truth from you. So, you think I am lying? Maybe. You know, this is the issue of
the people with small minds like you. What is the big deal in this if a boy and
girl were sitting together and having lunch? Fine, if she was just your friend and if you two were just having a formal lunch, then why did your father have
a misunderstanding? Because Papa is in the habit of
making a mountain out of a molehill. Mountains are not just made like that. They are made if there is a mole. Aren’t you talking too much? Don’t take undue advantage just
because I am answering you patiently. What has happened that you have
to search for friends outside? What is so bad about me? What is good in you? Your loud voice is evidence that Dad's suspicion is not baseless. Fiza, there is no need
to argue with me. Understand? And if you try to investigate
like this in the future, then you will see the worst in me. You look really pretty. Really? I still haven’t gotten ready yet. You look beautiful in every way. You make me delusional. Then become delusional. You are Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s chosen one. Really? Am I really your chosen one? Do you have a doubt? If I say, I have a doubt, then? Then I will try to remove
your doubt with my love. We have to go to the wedding. Going to the wedding is not
that important either. I will change and come. Excuse me. It is you. Who else can it be? No one. Are you getting bored? I don’t know anyone here, that’s why. If you introduce her, then
she will get to know people. You? Here? It is my best friend’s event, I had to be here. Won't you introduce us?
Huh? Of course. This is Dua, my wife. Second wife. The first one was Kashmala, right? Dua, this is Farah. Only Farah? You are really a miser in the matters of words,
even today, Ghaznavi. Okay, no problem. I will introduce myself in detail, myself. We were very good friends. In fact, even now. We were university friends, and then… Why are you in such a hurry
to tell everything? So, you tell her yourself? Excuse me, sir. Sir is calling you. Excuse me. When Ghaznavi told me
about his marriage with you, then I understood, that his choice cannot be anything ordinary. Thank you for the compliment. You are beautiful but not more than me. What comparison is there
between you and me? I am Ghaznavi's wife, and you are just a friend. He used to love me.
He used to. Now he loves me. You know? I thought you were unaware. It is all an issue of your thinking. Now see, you came like this after so many years, to tell me about some filmy story
from the university. You people are mature now. Move forward,
and think of something else. Stay in your limit, girl.
Uh-huh. Mrs. Nosherwan Ghaznavi. Ghaznavi has loved you at one time, if not yourself, then at least care for his respect. Seeing you speak in such a manner,
what do you think I will think? At least think about that. You will think? My foot. What are you people talking about? Nothing. Farah was telling me about her
good and bad habits. Do you want to stay longer
or shall we go? Huh? It is up to you. Let’s go. Let’s go. Excuse me. You didn’t tell me, Farah was your university friend. What difference do these things make? You have a lot of friends. Hmm. But, she was a little surprised when
you introduced her as a friend. Why are you giving so much importance
to these things? What is wrong with you? I am not giving it importance. I am just asking. Do you not like it? Obviously. When you leave the two of us and include a third person in our conversation,
then I will dislike it. Okay. If you disliked it, then I won't do it now. That’s what good wives do. Really? What happened to the plan of us
going abroad that you talked about? It is good that you reminded me.
Be ready tomorrow. We will go for your passport. Coffee? Tea?
Will you have something? No, man, I prefer green tea. Okay. Why have you come here? You were not answering my call, so what else could I do? Farah, I am married.
Why don’t you get it? You met Dua yesterday, right? It makes no difference to me, and she is really ordinary. But, she is special to me. Really special. You used to say this for me as well. Yes, I used to. Then you made yourself, ordinary. See, Ghaznavi. I have apologized to you for that. I don’t want anything from you. Not even an apology. I know, you are angry with me
because I had left. Please give me some time. I will make redemption for all my mistakes. There are certain mistakes
that cannot be redeemed. Ghaznavi. You are wasting your time. Leave from here. Please. Please, try to understand. Hello. Where are you? I am in the office. Still? We had to go for the passport, right? You didn’t come.
Yes, an important meeting came up.
I was busy with that. I have sent the driver,
he will explain everything to you. Go with him, please. But, Ghaznavi, I know nothing about all this. Okay, don’t worry, I will send Jaffar. You reach there with the driver, okay? Fine. Ghaznavi. What was this? Ghaznavi is with Farah. You were ignoring me and
talking to that Dua. I was getting so jealous.
She is my wife. Who am I? Who am I, Ghaznavi? You showed me dreams of love, and sacrifice also came in my share. Why? Speak up, why? I don’t want to repeat the past. Ghaznavi, you cannot ignore me. Leave from here. Ghaznavi, please try to understand. I said, leave me. And don’t come here again. Leave. Madam, the car is ready.
The driver is waiting for you. You go ahead, I am coming. You have no idea that Nosherwan
used to love Farah like crazy. You are really a miser in the matters of words,
even today, Ghaznavi. Okay, no problem. I will introduce myself in detail, myself. We were very good friends. In fact, even now. Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Fiza.
Dua. Dua. Dua, Dua, where did you go that day? Huh? And why were you not meeting us? Mama, Papa, Sania? They are all fine. They are all fine. This…who are all these people? They are with me. For my protection. All? All of them? Where did you go that night? Tell me. Where did you go?
What happened? I will tell you everything. You tell me, where are you going? I am going home right now. Did you not resign from the school job? No. What happened to you? Nothing. I was a little unwell. I am fine now.
I am absolutely fine. No, how will you go?
I will drop you home. No. No. No. We will talk.
Then we will meet later. Okay, come on,
give me your number. No, I don’t have a number.
I don’t have a phone, Dua. You give me your number,
I will contact you, okay? Write your number on this, then we will talk. Here, write your number. Even today you take
everything with you, right? Everything is the same. Just you were not there. I will call you myself,
I will contact you, then we will meet. Okay? Yes.
I will call you. And, I am getting late. I have to reach home without fail.
And..and… Okay, take care of yourself. Yes. Yes.
Okay, bye. You. You. You, give me the address
of your home. I will come to meet you. No, I am telling you,
I will contact you and meet you. I am getting late right now,
okay? Take care. Come on, Brother. Come on. Let’s go. Did you not resign from the school job? No. What happened to you? Nothing. I was a little unwell.
I am fine now. I am absolutely fine. No, how will you go?
I will drop you home. No. No. No. We will talk.
Then we will meet later. Greetings. What is the update on the passport? You are lost in deep thought.
What are you thinking? Nothing happened. This. What is this?
