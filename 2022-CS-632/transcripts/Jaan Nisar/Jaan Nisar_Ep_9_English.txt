Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. I don’t see Sister Dua. Dua has, what do you call it, food poisoning. So, she is resting in her room. Oh God, I hope there is nothing to worry about. No. The doctor gave her
a drip in the afternoon. They asked her to get rest,
so she is resting. You, come on. Okay, may God give
heath to the child. Aunty, can I meet Sister-in-law? Fiza will come on stage
after the marriage. If you want to meet earlier, then go ahead. Yes, Sister Dua is not there either, I miss her too. I will meet her as well. Yes, yes, meet her. Do meet her. She has locked her room. Actually the doctor has said that no one should bother her. Let her rest. She is really unwell. That’s why. You can meet her later. Okay? If you want to meet Fiza, then I will send Sania with you. Sania. Thank you. Let’s go. Let’s go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. You’ve spilled the nail
polish everywhere. You cannot do anything properly. Aunty, what do we do about this girl now? Why? Why do you ask? No need to worry too much, mind your own business. The poor thing is still unconscious. She must have gotten trapped
in someone’s love, like me. Hey, my love, that’s how it is. Someone gets trapped and someone gets out of this trap. Anyway, I am only concerned
about my money. That’s it. Aunty, please, let her go. She seems to be
from a good home. Why? Did the one who left her here, feel pity, that I will feel pity? Get lost from here, no need to sympathize
with her too much. And focus on your work, you focus on talking. She is showing sympathy to her. What happened, Saeein? I have a weird restlessness. I don’t understand anything. Yes, Saeein. Have your medication. Maybe you are restless
because of the pain. I don’t know, man. She is fine, right? Err… right now, your recovery is really important. Answer what you are asked. Is she fine? Yes, Saeein. She is fine. I don’t know why, my heart
is restless for Dua. I feel as though
she is in some trouble. Jaffar, you find out. Saeein, don’t worry about her. When you have given
me her responsibility then you don’t need to worry. My men, have their eyes on her. I will not tolerate any negligence
from you people with regards to Dua. Remember that. Look, you don’t worry. Right now you are not well… Were you two talking
about something important? Nothing special. It is time for his medication. Give it. Jaffar is here to take care of me. You don’t bother. Jaffar give me the medication. You, leave. I will give him the medication. Leave. Sure. Faraz… Faraz. Faraz. Fa… Who are you? I am Reena. Thank you. What is the need for thanks? Nosherwan, if something
had happened to you, then God knows what
I would have done. I wont die so soon. May your enemies die. I want to live a long and
loving life with you. Even I want to live, but with someone else. What are you thinking? Does it hurt? I have been tolerating pain for so long. But, when will you understand? Hey, Sister Fehmida, come here. Yes. Okay tell me, how is Dua? Hey, it is her Sister’s wedding and the lively Daughter is not part of this event. It is not fun at all. She must be with Fiza. I will check on her. You people, sit. Hey, she is constantly making excuses. Did you see just now? I feel something is fishy. When the wedding
procession came, she was making the same
excuses to the groom’s Mother that she is unwell, she is unwell. You are too much. It is possible that she is really unwell. Leave it. Did you not see her face? She was so worried. There is surely something
that she is hiding. Leave it, enjoy the wedding. See, the setup is so good. See. Yes, they put up a really good setup. They have spent a lot of money. The food will be good too. It is my Sister’s wedding. I was going to her. I shouldn’t have come here. I shouldn’t have come here. Go from this place, this place is not worthy of you. Where will I go? I… I trusted him. I loved him and he ruined my life. How will I go home? My parents will kill me. They will bury me alive. Nothing will happen. You tell them everything honestly. They will forgive you. Get up and leave. No. I cannot… Fiza, Daughter of Aslam, your marriage is being arranged with Sarfaraz,
Son of Nazeer Ahmad, with a dowry of two
hundred thousand rupees. Do you accept this marriage? Say yes, child. Yes. I accept. Sarfaraz, Son of Nazeer Ahmad, your marriage is being arranged
with Fiza, Daughter of Aslam, with a dowry of two
hundred thousand rupees. Do you accept this marriage? One minute, Sarfaraz. What happened Sister Kausar? Nazeer. Hey, what happened? Come on, I want to talk to you
about something important. Hey, we can even talk later. Why did you stop the wedding? Come for a moment What is the matter, Kausar? Why did you stop the wedding? Who got two hundred thousand
written as the wedding gift? We had decided fifty
thousand when we left home. Fifty thousand was your suggestion, I didn’t accept it. And in today's times, what can be done with fifty thousand? Come on, tell the maulvi sahib to cut out two hundred thousand and write fifty thousand. I will not do this at all. You are causing issues in
the wedding for no reason, for a few thousands. Be quiet and sit there. Few thousands? It is two hundred thousand. Two hundred thousand. Kausar, I told you quietly go and sit there, and don’t interfere now. Come on, let the wedding take place. Come on. Nothing, I had to talk about
something important. Please, go ahead. Sarfaraz, Son of Nazeer Ahmad, your marriage is being arranged

I would be so lucky, that I will get such a pretty bride. Hey, girl! Where are you running off to? To…my home. Home. Home? Which home? What sort of home? The one who had brought you, he left you and ran away. From today, this is your home. Come inside. No. Please let me go to my home. Don’t keep me here, please. Please, let me go. Please. Your lover sold you to me and went. He counted the entire sum and left. No, you are lying. I have heard enough of your nonsense. Hear me out clearly, he took the full price. From today, you belong to me. Faraz cannot do this. You let me go. I have to go home. Mama and Papa must be waiting. They will scold me a lot. They will beat me a lot. Please, let me go. I don’t want to live here. Please let me go. Believe this as soon as possible. Come on, Reena, take her inside. No. No. Please, no. Please, no. I don’t want to go. I said take her inside. I don’t want to go. Please. Take her inside. Aunty, run from here, the police has raided the place. Quickly run from here. Hey, you will get raided. Where are you going? Hey, stop. You don’t know me. Come on, check in all the rooms. No one will go. I have really high connections.
Check every room. No one will go. Hey, we will see your
connections as well, when you go to the police station. You don’t worry, we will care a lot for her. Yes, you start writing their contacts and all of you tell us your
telephone numbers one by one, so that your families can be informed, and they are called here. Everyone start speaking. Sir, you can do what you want. I cannot call my family. I am helpless. You will have to call your family. If you want, you can tell them their name
and address right now, or else, if she starts asking you in her style, then you will find it difficult to tell us. Will you tell me or should
I slap you again? Tell me quickly. What is sir asking you? Are you having a hard time telling
us the name and number? Tell us. Yes, you tell me. What is your name? Hey, speak up. D.. Can you not hear me? Tell us the name and
address of your family. Will I have to repeat it
for everyone one by one? Speak up. Dua. Dua. Tell me your father’s
name and phone number. Sir… Did you not hear me? Should I call her? Please… I am from a respectable home, please. I am a really respectable girl, sir. From a respectable home. Did all of you hear it? If you are from
a respectable home, then what were you doing there? They all say that they are from
a respectable family after getting caught. Tell us your father’s name and number. Hey tell us, speak up. Hey, will you tell us or not? Should I call her? Just think… think we have sent off two Daughter. We sent one to her in-laws home, and we lowered the other to the grave. Don’t say that. Dua is our child, our Daughter. Find her and bring
her from somewhere. Where do I find her from? If you know her location, then give me her address. I will bring her from her lover’s home. God damn it, she ruined me. She dishonored me. I never imagined even
in my worst nightmares that I’d have to lie to people
to save her honor, to maintain her illusion. Oh, check. Check, see, what if it is Dua. hello. Is this Mr. Aslam? Who is this? I am the inspector from
the police station. Police station? You are calling from
the police station? What do you want to talk about? Your Daughter is in our custody. What is she doing in your custody? You come to the police station and hear your Daughter’s adventures. Hey… God be kind. They were calling from
the police station and what were
they saying about Dua? Hey, Dua is in the police station. God knows what she did. I used to tell you that Dua is surely in some difficulty. The same thing happened. Hey, we will find that out
when I go to the police station, that she is in trouble or has she got us into trouble. Mama, I hope Sister is fine. Pray. May God bless her,
may she be fine. Oh God, have mercy. My Lord. Have mercy. You are such a good
and brave man, but have no realization
of my emotions, my love. Why do you run away
from me, Nosherwan? You were running from me and fate put you in my arms. Where will you run to, now? Now, you will be in
my control for a few days. You don’t need to worry about me. Err… I can still take care of myself. And the desire to control me, will always remain
a desire for you. Nosherwan, I… Should we not do the custom? Should we do the sweet custom? We will feed both of them, this will be the custom. Hey girls. Stop it. Stop it. Enough fun and game. Now we will have
the custom of seeing the face. Should I set this? Although the bride and groom
have already seen each other, there are still customs
to be done, right? Yes, absolutely. Come on, bring the veil. Be quick. Okay. Here you go. Here, look at each other. Sister-in-law, look at him carefully. Don’t complain later. You saw him carefully, right? Mr. Aslam, you look
like a decent man, but your Daughter, her actions are… What did she do, inspector? Huh? The apartment your
Daughter was arrested from, there… Tell me something, are you acting like
you are unaware or did you already know all this? Here you go, here is the ring. Whoever finds it, wins. Okay? Come on, find it. Sister-in-law, you have to find it. You have to keep a hold on Brother. Wow, your Sister-in-law just came in this home and you changed your party. yes, what else? Hey, be quick. Okay. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Hey, What? I think I found something. No, it is not that easy
to find, Brother. Try. Try. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law. Your Sister-in-law, won. See. She had to win. I don’t know where Dua will be. What condition will my Sister be in? Should I bring something to eat? What is this? Such a light set, thin like a feather. We didn’t ask your
Parents for anything, but they crossed the limit. Did you just bring this, or is there something else too? Huh? Speak up. Why don’t you speak? It is just this. What was the need for this, even. They should have just married
off their daughter in one dress. Your Parents have taken undue
advantage of our decency. Huh! Mama. Hmm? Papa is calling you. He cannot do anything without me. Move. Sister-in-law, tea? Coffee? Should
I bring something? No, thank you. Okay, don’t worry. You rest, Brother will be here soon. Okay? You are a decent man, that’s why I am letting you go. Had the FIR been filed, it would have become difficult for me. Take your Daughter. Inspector, she is not my Daughter. She is not my Daughter. Are you in your senses? What are you saying? I told you, she is not my Daughter. Papa. Papa, please, don’t leave me here. Papa, I made a mistake. Forgive me. All this is not true. I will tell you everything. Please, don’t leave me here. Please, Papa. Please. Inspector, she is not my daughter. Leave my hand. Papa. Leave my hand. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa, listen to me. Papa, please. Papa, please, don’t leave me here. Papa, please. Please. Please. Please. Papa, please, please, don’t leave me here and go.
I will die. Papa, please. Your father is dead. After what I heard today, even if I had a Daughter, then she too would have died. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa.
