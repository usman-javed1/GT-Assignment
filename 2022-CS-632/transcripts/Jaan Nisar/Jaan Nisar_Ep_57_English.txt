Inspector, my daughter is innocent. She is not guilty, please let her go. There are some serious
 allegations against her, her co-wife has registered
 an FIR against her. She is an eyewitness. Then how can you say this? Our daughter can't do anything like this, she is not the kind of person. We are very respectable people, you come to our neighborhood, ask the whole neighborhood, we are very respectable. We are respected by everyone. When your daughter was trying
 to trick a rich man into marrying him, where did your respect go then? And now you are here
 to clarify things on her behalf. You should have married your greedy daughter 
with someone of your own standard. Why did you marry
 her into a rich family? Go now, bring a lawyer. Inspector my daughter is innocent, how will she stay in a lockup? She should have thought about 
that before poisoning him. Now go from here. 
Don’t waste my time! Go away. They couldn’t handle 
their own daughter. When she kills someone, they come here, 
wearing the garb of decency. Why are you looking at my face? Go now! I did not poison Ghaznavi, I didn’t kill him, I can’t take anyone’s life, I am your daughter, 
you trust me, right? I can’t do anything like this, 
please believe me. We believe you, you can’t kill anyone, child. I am… I am really scared. I am really scared, Father. I am really scared. Child, don’t worry. We are trying to get you out of here, 
don’t you worry. May God protect you, my child. What will we do now? Mother, have some water. How will we free Dua? Aslam, our daughter can’t take anyone’s life. Yes, even I don’t believe
 that Dua can kill anyone. I don’t understand Fehmida, 
what should I do? What is there to understand? Hire a lawyer, we will fight the case. We will go in front of the judge and say, that our daughter did nothing, she is innocent. That is alright, I’ll talk to a lawyer. You don’t worry,
 everything will be sorted. How can I not worry? I can’t bear to see
 Dua in this condition. Please do something. For God’s sake, do something.
 Get my daughter out. Mother, calm down. You will get sick 
if you keep crying like this. Yes, Fehmida, 
this way you’ll get really sick. God, when will our trials end? Nosherwan, Nosherwan, 
what’s wrong? Water… Water, water!  Here, have some water.  What is wrong? Nosherwan! Is anyone there? Is there anyone... What was in the food? Did you poison it? No, no, Ghaznavi! What have you done? Tell the truth, was there something in the food Dua? Nosherwan! Jaffar! Nosherwan are you okay? My son tried to turn dirt into a crown. That’s the exact reason 
I used to stop him from doing that, because people of low birth and
 low status are never loyal to you. You’ve proven that my thoughts 
about you were correct. Nosherwan’s foolishness! He has prepared 
the tools for his own death. You? Here? Yes, I just got the news
 that you got arrested. You poisoned Ghaznavi? Look whatever it is Dua, I. 
I don’t believe that you can do anything like this. And you… you don’t worry, I am with you. Go away from here. Even if you don’t need me, I can’t leave you alone
 here in this situation. And I’ll see who can 
trouble you like this. Whatever it is, I won’t let you stay here for long. I promise you, I’ll get you free. I don’t need you. Go away from here. Dua, I have really loved you, and I will keep loving you. You’ll see, you’ll see, when I get you free from here, then you’ll realize how much I love you. I would never leave you alone
 in this condition. For God’s sake, go away from here and
 stop coming after me. Fine, but I’ll get you free from here, then only you’ll realize that I really love you. Hello. Sir Jaffar, Dua got arrested from her place. What? Yes, Ma’am Kashmala 
went herself to get her arrested. Alright. Sakina, quickly bring the soup. And where is the juice? I’ll just bring it. Oh, just bring everything together. Madam? Hmm? I want to talk to you about something. Yes, go ahead. I just got the news that police arrested Madam Jr. So? So, did you get her arrested? Whatever you want to ask me,
 ask me clearly. You didn’t even inform me that you are taking such a big step. Have you lost your mind? Think about who you are questioning! I apologize. The social standing, honor, and rank, 
that you have in this house, the same social standing,
 honor, and rank, is of Madam Jr. This is why I asked you. You have asked me today, but don’t ask ever again. And Jaffar, remember 
one thing clearly. You are a servant, so act like one. Don’t try to be the master. I apologize, but why did you do this? She was poisoning my Nosherwan, I saw it with my own eyes. Should I have let her go? 
Should I have left her? Nosherwan is quite proud 
of your loyalty towards him. But I can clearly see 
where your loyalties lie. Not for us, but it is clear from whom. No Madam, my loyalties have 
always been to this manor and the people of this manor. And as far as Madam Jr. is concerned, you all know how much Saeein loves her. He doesn’t want that she faces any kind of pain. That is why I asked you all this. I did what I felt right. And before you ask me 
any questions, understand this, I am not liable to answer 
any questions of yours. Madam, if you did not like me 
questioning you like this, I truly apologize. Go get the car. Go. Sure. Put everything in the car, hurry. Greetings, Amma Saeein, Baba Saeein. Greetings. Amma Saeein, I have brought food. Shall I get it served? Kashmala. Yes, Baba Saeein? Did you get Dua arrested? Yes, Baba Saeein. Why didn’t you take into confidence 
before doing such a thing? Baba Saeein, I couldn’t see Saeein in this condition. I had to get his culprit arrested. This is why I took such a step. Now, you can look 
after the further process. I didn’t expect this from Dua, that she could go so low. Nosherwan cared for more 
deeply than for his own life. And she, she tried taking our son’s life? Amma Saeein, Nosherwan Saeein is not 
good at reading people. The police came, to take Nosherwan’s statement. He is in a state of unconsciousness. They informed us that you got Dua arrested. You should have at least told us. Baba Saeein, I didn’t want to trouble you all. Anyway, someone had to take this step, so I took it. Jaffar, you brought food for Amma Saeein
 and Baba Saeein, right? Then why aren’t 
you getting it served? Get it served, go. Yes. Why have you come here? I wanted to talk to you. So, you’ll call me here for that? What if someone sees us, then? What do you want to talk about? Why did you get her arrested? Why are you here? Tell me that. I had to come. It had become important. Because you took such 
a step without asking me first. Why didn’t you tell me? You work for me. I don’t work for you that 
I would ask you everything, provide you with all the information, 
and then make a decision. Kashmala, look, whatever was decided among us, it was never mentioned that
 you would hurt Dua. The only thing we had planned
 was to separate the two, that’s it. Are you getting hurt? Didn’t you take money to destroy her? Now what happened? Why are you pitying her? Hey, whatever it is, I am just telling you that
 you will not harm her. I will get her out on bail and 
you won't come in the way. Her bail is impossible. Whatever it may be, Ghaznavi is still alive, when he regains consciousness and gives a statement, it would not be against Dua. So how will you prove
 that she is guilty? She is guilty because I have declared her guilty. Now whether someone 
accepts or doesn't, I don’t care. I know very well who is doing all this. Why are you using your brain so much? Mind your own business. And if someone sees us here, we will have another trouble,
 now go away from here. I am telling you this for the last time, I will get her out on bail and 
you will not come in the way. What are you doing here? I am just standing here. Can't I stand here of my free will? Can't I go anywhere on my own? Tell me. Oh, no, actually, Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein
 are asking after you. I am going. You’re playing with fire. Oh, I really don’t want to play with fire, that’s why I’m telling you to quietly go back to
your parents’ house. Or, if you don't want to go there, go to Sarfaraz. Isn't that the best option? What hasn't he done for you? He’s made so many big sacrifices, even left his wife for you. You did wrong when you came 
between me and Nosherwan. You poisoned his food and committed the crime, 
but I’m the one doing wrong? When you rot behind bars, then you’ll realize the mistake you made by coming
 between Nosherwan and I. Dua, I have hired a really 
good lawyer for you, and hopefully, till morning,
 he will get you out of here. Once the court opens, he just has to go through 
some procedures and then he will 
get you out of here. Fine, it's fine Dua, hate me 
as much as you want. Insult me as much as you want, I’ll still try to get close to you. Dua, I am really worried about you. I know this is all Kashmala’s
 doing because of Ghaznavi. Look if Ghaznavi thinks that you tried to kill him, are you going to sit here 
and grieve all your life? I can’t leave you here in anguish. Dua, please, listen to me. Greetings. What happened? You were gone for so long. The lawyer kept me waiting, I was waiting for him. He met me quite late, 
that is why I got late. What did the lawyer say? What will happen to our case? He will get Dua out, right? Oh, getting her out comes later, first the lawyer has asked for his fee. I don't know what to do. How much is the fee? I have some savings. 
I’ll take that out, and I have a little gold jewelry… how much is the fee? He is asking for one hundred and 
fifty thousand rupees just to take on the case. How will I give him that much? Tell me. one hundred and fifty thousand rupees? I don’t understand, Fehmida, I don’t understand anything. My head is spinning. I don’t know what to do, I am really helpless, very helpless. So, now… now we won’t be able 
to fight the case. Will our Dua stay in lockup? Hello? Yes, what is the report on Dua? First, her parents 
came to get her out, they are putting in a lot of effort. Her lover also came. Lover? Sarfaraz? Yes, yes, and he said that he would
 bring a lawyer tomorrow. Regardless of whoever anyone brings, or whatever happens, she should not get the bail. You get it, right? Oh, madam, now that you have said it, 
she won’t get the bail at all. This is why I am paying you so that you do as I say. You should not worry that 
she would get the bail. We’ll put more charges on her. She’ll rot in here. That is good, and you’ll keep getting paid extra for it. Why have you all come here? You all should have gone to court. We are here for Dua’s bail. My client is innocent. You have kept her locked up unlawfully. You should talk about this in court, not here. She isn’t just charged
 with poisoning, but your client has also fraudulently made Mr. Ghaznavi 
name his property in her name. And they also have proof of that. That is all a lie. My daughter is innocent. That is the truth, she is innocent. She is not like this. That is the truth. It would be best if you go to court, and try for her bail there. If she gets the bail, 
then you may come to me. Then I’ll decide whether 
to let your client go or not. Did Dua confess that she poisoned Nosherwan? Madam till now she has not confessed. What are you getting paid for then? You couldn’t get her to confess till now? Madam, give us some time. We are working on it. We will make her confess. It has taken a lot of time. This should have happened by now. Just wait a little longer, Madam. Did someone come for her bail? Yes, Madam. Her parents came, and Sarfaraz came with a lawyer. Listen to me carefully. Under no circumstances
 should she get the bail. Madam, don’t worry about it. She won’t get the bail at any cost. We’ll get her to confess
 her guilt till the morning, and after accepting the guilt, there is no chance of getting the bail. This is what I expect from you. Say it, you poisoned your husband. I didn’t poison him. Look, you have to say it, that you poisoned your husband. Say it, girl. Otherwise, I will resort to other means. Open your mouth and confess. No, I didn’t poison him. Yes, did she confess? No sir, she is quite stubborn. What has happened to you a lot? Don’t your hands
 work properly anymore? You can’t even make 
a culprit confess her guilt? I want this girl’s statement, a statement of her acceptance of guilt. Do whatever you want with her, understood? Nosherwan. Saeein, Nosherwan is regaining consciousness! Hmm, Nosherwan? Jaffar, go and get the doctor, quickly! Yes Sir. Nosherwan My son, Nosherwan. Amma Saeein…. Nosherwan. Thank God, you are conscious now. Congratulations to you all. Thank God. God has been merciful. Our child has regained consciousness. Thank you so much, Doctor. You are welcome. How are you feeling now Nosherwan? Where is Dua? Uh, you are not well right now son. You require rest, rest now. Carefully, carefully. I am fine Baba Saeein. Where is Dua? She has gone to her mother’s place. Where else would she go? Jaffar. Yes Sir? Go and bring Dua. Yes Sir. Dua is not at her mother’s place. If she is not at her mother’s place,
 then where is she? She is in lockup. She is in lockup? Why? Because she…. Because she tried to kill you, that is why I got her arrested. You shouldn’t have done this. I shouldn’t have done this? Nosherwan? What else should I have done? Should I have left you dying like this? I saw her give you poison 
with my own eyes. You have regained 
consciousness after two days. Look at your condition, and you are saying I shouldn’t have done this. Jaffar. Yes Sir? Go, get her out.
