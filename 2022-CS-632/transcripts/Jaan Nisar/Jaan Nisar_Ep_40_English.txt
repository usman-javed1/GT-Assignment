I have never clarified myself
in front of anyone ever, but it’s different when it comes to you. I can’t bear it when you are upset. That is why I had to create a proof. Watch it once, and if you still think I am guilty, I will accept whatever punishment
you want to give me. I thought you had especially
arranged this dinner for me. It is something like that. Mom? I tried a lot to make you understand that no one can take
Dua’s place in my life, there is no place for anyone. You told me your husband had divorced you, but you didn’t tell me
you also have a lovely son. What did you think? I would be so unaware that
I will trust whatever you say to me. I was trying to find your lie
since many days, and it is not difficult for me. If you were doing all this for me, you were doing wrong. I don’t have anything for you in my heart. I was just tolerating your madness
for the sake of humanity, as soon as I found a clue about Usama, I brought him in front of you. Go back to your husband and your son, I have nothing in my heart for you. I asked you to punish me, you got serious, dude. It’s not less than a punishment for
Ghaznavi to see tears in your eyes. What happened?
Why are you crying? Have I done something wrong? No, I am the one who did wrong. I put so many allegations against you
and doubted you so much but the truth was this, I am sorry. Okay, what would you do
if your doubt turned out to be true? I don’t know. I would have done something. Done what? Had you gone to Farah, then, I would have left you and
gone somewhere far away. Can you go far away from me? Maybe no. Maybe? No. No. I can’t go either, I am only yours forever. Sorry. Hey, daughter Fiza?
Hmm? Do everything in a proper manner. Nothing should look bad. Hey, nothing will happen, you are getting worried yourself
and confusing me as well. Everything is fine. My child, he is coming for the first time,
everything should be done nicely. They are here. Are they here? -Quickly, go.
-Yes, yes. Go, go, go. -Hey listen?
-What? What a hero sort of personality he has. Really? Come, come, let’s go, let’s go. Come, son, come. Come, come. Come, my child. Greetings. Greetings. That’s Mom. Stay blessed, son. And that’s Sania and Fiza. -Greetings.
-Greetings. Greetings. She has praised both of you
the most after Mom and Dad. She is praiseworthy herself. No. Less than you. Have a seat. Yes, thank you so much. You sit down as well, please. How are you? I was longing to meet you all, but I was unable to take out time
because of my busy work schedule. It hasn’t been late, son,
it hasn’t been late. Serve some cold or hot drink to him, our son-in-law has come
to our house for the first time. No, there is no rush, I will have food with you guys only. Why not, son?
This is your own house. Go. This marriage is a punishment for me, and it is the kind of punishment
I am not getting rid of. If you disliked me so much, you could have rejected this proposal. But no, if you disliked me, you would have told me at first sight. But Sarfaraz, you, you were so happy with me, so what happened all of a sudden? Right now, you don’t have so much value that you ask me a question,
do you understand? You are very lucky, sister, you have found such a hero. Sister-in-law, I am very happy. Tell me, what happened? Have sweets first. Now tell me why are you so happy? Khizar’s family agreed. They are coming for the
wedding ceremony this Friday. Really? So, then I should be feeding
you sweets as well. Have this. -Isn’t it good news?
-It is for sure. Are you happy?
Very happy. See, everything got fine. Everything got fine.
I told you so. Keep this, and how many pieces are in there? Keep this as well.
Where are Shami Kebabs? Yes, ma’am, they are in the back section. -Okay, bring them, please.
-Okay. Cooking oil is done as well,
Kebabs are here, I can’t see sela rice. The wedding date hasn’t been fixed yet,
and Mom gave this big list in our hands and has made this creature hound me. It is the limit! I’ve never been so frustrated in the heat. I can’t find sela rice. Wait here. Dua? Dua? You, you here? Fiza, who was this man with you? He? He is Sarfaraz, my husband,
your brother-in-law. He is coming. I am getting late,
I will meet you later. Who were you talking to? Who was she? I don’t know. She was asking for the medicine,
the pharmacy. Really? So, it means, you are the only one
she found in the whole market to ask where is the pharmacy. Who is she even asking? -Shall we go?
-Let’s go. Fiza, who was this man with you? He is Sarfaraz, my husband, your brother-in-law. Who came from their family?
And how were they? They were good noble people
and they really liked our Fiza. Our Fiza is very beautiful, anyone would like her. The boy is very handsome as well. Where did you guys see him? His mother brought a picture, he is very handsome, we really liked him and Fiza did too. Show me as well. Umm, sister Kausar took it back with her. I forgot to keep it,
I had to show it to your dad as well. Anyway, he will see him
when he will go there. So, you guys should have kept it for me. Okay, at least tell me the name. Sarfaraz. It would have been so nice
if Mom and Dad had taken us with them. We would have seen
the Brother Groom as well. Yes, you should be thankful Mom
and Dad didn’t listen to this otherwise, you would have gotten
a flying sandal coming towards you, and it would have been so much fun. By the way, brother's groom
is very handsome, Dad will like him too. I want to introduce you to Mom. Mom? Why? Because my marriage is being
discussed at home, I want you to meet Mom once
so she at least talks to Dad. Okay, give me some time to think. I will get married to someone else
meanwhile you take so much time to think. Do you know, I am very upset with you. Why me? You guys came with the picture
of Brother Groom the other day, right? But you guys took it back
without showing it to me. Umm, I am sorry, actually,
you weren’t there but I’ll make it up
for your complaint right now. How? I will show you
the pictures on my mobile. Oh, yes, I didn’t think of that. He keeps on making me click
his pictures all the time. He is so handsome and
so photogenic as well, his pictures come out so nice,
he is so good looking, I will show it to you,
he looks exactly like a hero. -Really?
-Let me show you. Yeah, this one, this one. The battery went low,
my mobile switched off, sorry. I will do one thing, I will go home and then I will come back
in two hours to pick you up. Where are you going?
Are you mad? Do you know if you
go home alone right now, Dad will be so angry, we already got permission to come
to the salon after so much difficulty. It’s better for me to go home and
help Mom rather than sitting here. You do know how Dad freaks her out. You are right, she is so emotional, she has been crying over every little thing. Come back before 2 hours,
I can’t sit alone here for so long. Faraz, I am getting very late, I have to get home before
the groom and family arrive. Hey, I know that, meet Mom and have juice
then we will leave. This is not needed. Dua? You have come to my, not my home but our home for the first time and you know what Mom was saying? She was saying that let your friend
go after having dinner. No, no, this is enough. Her in-laws are not nice at all. Uncle and Sumbul are still bearable, but Aunt and Brother Groom are very rude. It’s just that sister has
a lot of tolerance in her, they say so much to her
but sister doesn’t even sigh. What is the problem with them? Fiza is so nice. If someone has suffered after
you left home, it’s sister Fiza. They taunted her so much that
they made her life miserable. If they get to know that
you have come back to us, they might stop the sister from meeting us, Brother Groom also
threatened to divorce Sister. When you and I were about to become aunts, Brother Groom made such filthy
allegations against Sister that I feel Sister didn’t fall herself, she was tripped up. Show me the rice. You guys took so long
for such less items, yeah? Mom, they seem less items to you?
It took us all day to get them. Mistakenly, I got a day off,
you gave me this big list. I won’t go next time. Hey, what did I say to him that
he left like this? I am sure you must have
demanded something. When do I demand anything? Madam, my hair didn’t turn grey
in the sunlight, I know very well when wives go out with their husbands,
their tastebuds are activated, and they start making demands like,
chaat, stew, or lentil dumplings. You must have demanded
something weird too, that is why he got so cranky and left. Yes. Did you say something? No, I am quiet. So why are you standing quietly? Pick all this up and
keep it in the kitchen. And go easy on the oil, it has become very expensive. Okay. Hurry up. Slow motion. Greetings, Sir. Greetings. Why are you taking this back? Sir, madam has refused to eat. She doesn’t seem well. Okay, you may go.
I will check on her. Okay, sir. Dua? -Hmm?
-What happened? Nothing. Are you unwell? No, nothing. You don’t seem well to me, come,
let’s go to the doctor. No, I just have a slight headache. Headache? Come, let’s go to the doctor. Who goes to the doctor
for such slight pain? I will take the medicine and get well. Okay then take your medicine. God forbid, if the pain doesn’t get
better in an hour, we will go then. Hmm. Why are you having a headache? I didn’t ask the pain. That’s it. Shall I lie down for a while? What must Dua be thinking? I didn’t introduce her to Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz is still unaware
that Dua has returned. What if he finds out about Dua’s return? He will make me cut ties with everyone, or he will divorce me. What should I do? How should I get out of this trouble? What will you find out? Huh? That with who did she… She didn’t do it,
how many times have I told you? My sister Dua is not like that. Enough! Shut up! If you take her name again,
I am telling you, I will leave you forever. -Sister-in-law?
-Hmm? -Did I disturb you?
-No, no, come. Okay, look, Khizar has sent some
pictures for the wedding outfit, so please help me. -Show.
-Okay, this one, the color of this one
is very beautiful, but this one is very beautiful itself, okay, look at the second picture, the color combination of this one
is very beautiful, check out the embroidery, it is so beautiful. Show me the first one. This one? Hmm. And second? It’s embroidery. This one is very nice,
this color will suit you a lot. Right? I liked this one too.
Should I finalize it? Immediately do it.
Okay, done. You look so happy ever since
the wedding has been discussed. Your face is glowing. Why wouldn’t someone with such
a lovely sister-in-law be happy? Everything happened so soon,
I still can’t believe it, and all this happened
because of you. You will get Khizar
if God has written him in your fate. Sometimes I think you love me exactly
like you love sister Dua. Obviously. She was so nice, so lovely. I could only meet her once, I don’t know how she would be,
where she would be. She is in a very good condition. How do you know? Where is she? Dua has come back. She has married a very rich man, and Brother Ghaznavi is a very nice man. He loves her so much,
and all of us have forgiven her as well. What? That’s an amazing news. Hell will break loose if your mom
or Sarfaraz hears this. Didn’t you tell Brother? He doesn’t even like to hear her name. True. So then, what now? That is what I am thinking,
what should I do? What should I say? If sister Dua has started
coming to your house then Brother will get this news and his reaction will be very bad
if he finds this out from elsewhere. Before someone else tells him,
you should tell him. In fact, do one thing,
take Dad into confidence, Dad will talk to Brother and
your problem will be solved. Yes. I will do this but not right now, once you get married smoothly,
only after that. I don’t want any hindrance
to your happiness. See, you are thinking about others
before yourself, that is why I say you are precious. Come on now look at other things. -I…
-First, let me love you. Help me select my jewelry too. -Show me what you like.
-Let me show you. Look, this one, this one is very beautiful. You would have been better by now
if I hadn't listened to you at that time and called the doctor. You also have a fever now. Please turn off the AC, I am feeling very cold. Yes. I have called the doctor,
he is just coming. Sir, the doctor is here. Immediately send him inside. She is stressed out about something and she is probably also
under some mental pressure. What can be the stress about? Get these medicines. If her condition does not get better and if she stays semi-conscious,
take her to the hospital immediately. So, doctor, let’s take her
to the hospital right now. For now, give her these medicines. I hope she will get better with these, and you will save yourself from
the hassle of going to the hospital. Okay. Okay, these are madam’s medicines, take these to her home. Okay. Jaffar? Yes sir? What happened today? Nothing special, sir. So, what is your madam stressed about? I don’t know, sir. Hmm. Where did your madam go today
and who did she meet? Yes, she went to the store for some work and she met her sister on her way back. She met her sister? Fiza? Yes sir. Hmm, it means something must have
happened between them because of which Dua is upset. I can’t say anything. Okay, you may go. Okay. She is stressed out about something and she is probably also
under some mental pressure. Yes, she went to the store for some work and she met her sister on her way back. How are you feeling now? A lot better. Good. Umm, Sir, they are here. Seat them, we will be there. Okay sure. Who has come so early in the morning? Some special people, you haven’t had your breakfast, right?
Come, let’s have it together. Okay, fine but who are those people? Where are they from? All your questions will be answered
when you meet them. I am not even well, you should have told me,
I look so weird. What will they think that how is she? My wife looks beautiful in any condition. Come.
