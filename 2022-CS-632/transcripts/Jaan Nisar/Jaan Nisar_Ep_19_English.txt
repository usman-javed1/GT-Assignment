Stop your advancing steps Nosherwan. No, mom. You know... ...I don’t look back once
I make a decision. You’re going against
our decision Nosherwan, do you know the outcome
of coming to blows with us? You know very well what we can do. I know Baba Saeein, I know it very well. I can compete with this world
but not with you, I don’t want to fight you. All I’m going to say is... ...you took Farah away from me... ...don’t take this away as well. Otherwise, I won’t be able to survive this time. You people have taken my happiness
away from me before this as well, I only have one heart. I can’t keep on sacrificing it. Can I go? Goodbye. What is my fault? There’s no fault of yours, that’s why I’ve talked to Mom and Dad, if you want freedom let me know
and I’ll give it to you. Is she very beautiful? She is my love. Saeein, we kept thinking of him as unaware
and he kept thinking of us as cruel. After all, we also broke his heart, we can’t repeatedly leave his heart desolate. Stay with the person you show your loyalty to. Jaffar today is your driving test. Tell me, until when will you continue to have
me be humiliated by my own daughters? There’s no fault of Fiza in this. The poor girl herself was worried. Is it no fault of Fiza? She got her dad humiliated by her
husband and her mother-in-law and you’re saying that Fiza is not at fault. Mr. Aslam I was already refusing before,
you shouldn’t have called those people over. Why? Why shouldn’t I have called them over? My name comes after Fiza’s in her paternity. When my daughters step outside
all the fingers will be pointed at me. She’ll probably get an earful by
her in-laws because of you, she’s newlywed. And the disrespect she showed to her father,
you’re not even considering that. We’re the daughter’s side of the family,
why don’t you understand that Mr. Aslam? That’s your fault as well,
you gave birth to daughters. The mother isn’t the deciding
factor of the child’s genes Mr. Aslam, how long will you blame me? Hey, don’t cry, don’t cry. However, it happens I’ll bear it on my heart,
even though it’s not something bearable. Tell your daughter to not
come to our house anymore, she should stay where she is,
in her house. I can’t tolerate these continuous dramas. Tell her that we’re dead to her. Who knows what consequences
that poor girl must be enduring? Mom. Get a hold of yourself. Listen to me, why did your father invite us
there to humiliate us? I don’t… I… I really didn’t know, I didn’t know that
that’s why dad called us there. Okay, so did he get a revelation or a dream
that you started working again? Sania studies in the same school, I met both of them when mom
came to drop her off in the morning. Okay, so now I understand that you’re the one
who told them that I forced you to get a job. Why would I say that? Don’t lie to me, don’t lie to me. What need do I have to lie Sarfaraz? There’s a need, there’s absolutely a need... ...because of the type of house you belong to. If girls run away from there or have a job before marriage, they have no problem with it but the second the in-laws asked to start
the same job again then they have a problem with it. What… What type of things are you saying? I’m completely right, I endured it today but
if your dad talks like that again then no one will be worse than me and then I’ll present myself in my own way and it won’t be good. Yes, I’m reaching, I’m reaching in 30 minutes,
yes, very kind of you, goodbye. I can’t wait any longer now,
I have to conduct another wedding and the wedding procession
is already ready there. Goodbye. Jaffar, give me your phone. Yes, sir. Drive faster. The pain of a broken heart is just as much. The cleric came to conduct
the wedding and left as well and the one who didn’t come was her groom. It seems like he got scared
of paying the asked price, and ran away. Ran away, hmm? By the way, you’re very innocent, stupid, you sat there believing
the words of that wealthy man. Do girls like you even make a home? They’re just an adornment
for someone’s arms, right? Dua! Will you ruin your
appearance before I’ve seen it? At least give me the right to see, that how your appearance
changed after becoming my bride. Should we start the wedding ceremony? Yes, start. Dua, daughter of Aslam your marriage will be fixed
with Nosherwan Ghaznavi, son of Hashmatullah, with a wedding gift of
50 million rupees at the current rate. Do you accept? Dua, answer. I accept. Nosherwan Ghaznavi, son of Hashmatullah, your marriage will be fixed with Dua,
daughter of Aslam, with a wedding gift of
50 million rupees at the current rate. Do you accept? I accept. One minute, one minute. Mr. Nosherwan Ghaznavi, you’ve forgotten everything
the moment you got Dua. Jaffar. Yes. Nosherwan Ghaznavi doesn’t forget neither
does he go back on his promises. Let’s go. What happened, are you not happy? I’m happy. Then what’s the reason for this sadness? That cheque. You shouldn’t have given
Zunaira that blank cheque, she’ll bring a lot of harm to you. Let her. Still, a blank cheque, I feel very bad about it. And if right now you talk about
anyone other than me that I won’t like it. Yes. I’m very happy today, maybe you are as well, look at me, it’s my fault, maybe I entered your life too late, you had to go through so much. Okay now please, don’t cry. If you keep a friendship with tears while
I’m here then we’ll have a lot of fights. I won’t cry. I don’t care who was
and wasn’t in your life before me, but there should be no space for anyone
else other than me in your life after today, hm? Trust me as much as you trust yourself. I, I’ll never humiliate you. That’s what I expect from you. I’m marrying Dua Kashmala is married to you, she is present in this mansion as your wife. Kashmala is our family’s daughter-in-law. Could you only find that dirty girl
as her replacement, to bring into our family? An accident took her there,
otherwise I know her, she belongs to a simple,
respectable household. There’s no fault of yours, that’s why I’ve told Mom and Dad
if you want freedom let me know. I’ll give it to you. Is she very pretty? She is my love. Mizna, eat your food child. I don’t want to eat. Uncle came and left
without even meeting us, even though he knows we miss him
a lot he still left without meeting us. Hmm Uncle was in a hurry
that’s why he didn’t meet you. Next time he comes, he’ll come with a lot of spare time
and he’ll spend time with you. You’re telling the truth, right grandmother? Can I ever lie to my doll? No. Madam. Pirah, I told you to call Kashmala for dinner. She refused to come, she’s crying a lot. Alright. Why is mom crying? Nothing child, eat your food. Go check on her, it’s a difficult time for the girl. Yes, make sure that the kids eat their food. Yes I’ll be back
Go. Eat children, eat, eat, eat. Is everything alright doctor? Yes Mr. Ghaznavi, there’s nothing
to be worried about, she’s fine. I’ve given her first aid
so she’ll wake up in a little while. Yes, thank you! Don’t worry, if you still need anything
then you can call me. Sure, come on, please. Who has this much courage? An investigation is going on sir,
we’ll find out very soon. I will punish that person so severely
that his coming generations will remember it. Yes, sir. Hello. Greetings, madam. Get to the point. Madam, I tried my ha…
hardest but despite that the g…gi… girl survive…survived madam. She survived? How did she survive? I asked you to attack those people so that
that girl wouldn’t be able to survive. She should’ve died before
entering Nosherwan’s life. And you’re telling me
your tales of incompetence? Madam, I went fully prepared madam but younger sir’s men proved to be
so alert that all my men got killed. I barely managed to escape
with my life madam. Why didn’t you drown and
die before making this phone call? A..Am…Amma Saeein I… How dare you have the audacity, the nerve that you took such a big step. Until a few minutes ago, we were concerned about you, all our sympathies were with you, I was coming to ask how you were feeling, and you... got so consumed by
your envy of his second wife that you stooped so low as to incite
a deadly attack on Nosherwan and his bride. Do you have any idea... ...what would’ve happened to you
if anyone had lost their lives in that attack? Something horrible will happen to you when Nosherwan finds out that
you had him and Dua attacked. So Amma Saeein, no,
what else could I have done? What else could I have done? You people gave Nosherwan
permission to get married again… So! So, this is the method you found? You’ve forgotten all
the favors of our son, right? Someone who didn’t leave you
to face the difficulties of life, or leave to face all types of setbacks, accepted you in his marriage, and never let your children
feel Zawar’s absence. And what did I get from
that Amma Saeein, huh? My heart is still as desolate,
still as barren, what did I get from that? You’re very ungrateful, very forgetful of kindness. Nosherwan broke his heart
to fill your life with happiness, you reside in this mansion to this day
with all the rights of ownership. And you, you tried to devastate that
same Nosherwan’s heart and life? You should be ashamed. Wow Amma Saeein, wow, look how worried you are about
your son’s heart being broken and you forget that I’m a human too, I also have a heart, I accept that I made a mistake, I will accept whatever punishment
I’m given for this mistake. But answer one thing, where should I go with
the restlessness inside me? Tell me, where should I go? Amma Saaein. Why did she survive, why did she survive? Yes Jaffar, what happened? Uh, It’s Amma Saaein calling. Greetings mom. Greetings son, stay blessed. Nosherwan, ever since I’ve heard of
the attack on you my heart has become very worried. I’m completely fine, this means that you’ve found out. What do you think, that we stay unaware of
what goes on with you? No, Mom, I know you get
every news regarding me. How are you? I’m perfectly fine, don’t worry at all. And that girl? Your daughter-in-law. So, you’ve married her? Yes. Take care of yourself
and of our daughter-in-law. Definitely. Greetings. Ghaznavi. Relax, I’m with you, keep lying down, you need the rest. Are you alright? I’m perfectly fine, you nearly ended my life
by falling unconscious. It was a brutal attack, shots were being fired, are you really alright? I’m in front of you, I’ve survived a lot of times
before this in attacks as well but believe me I’ve never been as happy
about that as I am today. If I’d lost my life in this attack then how would I have seen
how you are agonising for me? God forbid something happens to you, who were those people? Enemies? Enemies? But who could be your enemy, you’re so good. Good? Maybe you think
I’m good but not my enemies. I’ll tell you this much that
I have more enemies than I have friends. Why? You’ve just came in to my life, I’ll tell you everything slowly and gradually, currently I’m worried about you,
I’ll order something to eat. Listen, don’t go anywhere, please. I’m not going anywhere.
