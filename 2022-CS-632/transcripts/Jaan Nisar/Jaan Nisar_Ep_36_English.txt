You made me a stranger, right? Why did you not tell me, Fiza, that you had to tolerate
so much because of me? What could I tell you, huh? Dua, you are my sister. Yes, so? You didn’t have to tolerate all this. Why are your in-laws
punishing you for my mistakes? What sort of people are they? You have to tolerate so much. Your child… I am sorry Fiza. I am really sorry. I am the only one responsible for all this. Only me. Just understand... what's there to understand? What has happened
is what's written in destiny. No, this is the ransom for my mistakes that you are paying. Why? You are so good. How can someone do bad with you? I am good, but maybe not that much,
that I can meet their standards. Have you not heard, the true wife is the one with
whom the husband is pleased? No, Fiza. No. You don’t need to tolerate anything. I will go to your in-laws. I will talk to everyone. I will beg them, fall at their feet, and ask for forgiveness. I will tell them that you are not at fault. They should not punish you. Any punishment should be given to me. Every mistake is mine. I am the one to blame. No, you won’t do any of that. Are you so weak that you would go and beg
in front of someone like that? No, my sister is not that weak. If you can do so much for me, I can do everything for you, Fiza. You are such a beloved sister of mine. You are so good. I cannot see anything
like this happening with you. There is no need to do anything, I will deal with it myself, okay? For now, for now, let me enjoy this happiness, that now you can come to us. And whenever I miss you, I can meet you. Forget whatever happened for now. Let me be happy today. Please. Okay? Idiot. You started crying. I am happy. Can you not be happy? You are back from your Mother’s home. Yes. Come here. How long will you stay upset like this? I am not upset. Then what is all this? You are not talking to me, nor do you look at me. What happened to you? Since you have people to talk to, what's the need for me? She is committing suicide for you. Make her yours, she'll be happy, and so will you. Dua, I only love you. Then why do you go to her? Why is she calling you? If she is so important to you, then go to her, make her yours, and leave me. Enough! Just because I love you doesn't mean I'll agree to
everything unreasonable you say. Farah was my past, and you are my present. Is this the extent of your love, that you would doubt my character? Nosherwan Ghaznavi's
character is not so low. Nosherwan is my son and I have brought him up. But, today, you have
become our daughter-in-law, so I am making you understand, that, along with trusting
your husband, blindly, it's also important to keep an
eye on his day-to-day activities. From where did Farah
come into your life again? Baba Saeein,
there is nothing like you think. If there is nothing like that, then why have you been seen
visiting Farah’s home? Farah was my past, and you are my present. Is this the extent of your love, that you would doubt my character? Nosherwan Ghaznavi's
character is not so low. Bano, check who is outside. Bano, check who is outside. You? Yes, me. What is there to be
so surprised about this? What have you come here for? I had to come here after what you are doing. And what exactly am I doing? You are making a failed attempt to ensnare
Ghaznavi in the trap of your fake love. Neither am I a liar nor is love fake. Really? So why were you unfaithful to Ghaznavi and left him to marry someone else? I wasn’t unfaithful, Ghaznavi was. He married Kashmala. Okay, he married Kashmala, so you left him and went. Right. So why did you come now? Now Nosherwan Ghaznavi
doesn’t have one wife, he has two. Even if millions like you come, you still cannot snatch Ghaznavi from me. You are alone. Isn’t Ghaznavi there? Call him. Ask him to come. Just like you beg and plead to see him, plead again. Maybe he'll take pity and come. At least this way, you'll maintain your delusion that he loves you. Girls like you need to beg. A filthy flower that Ghaznavi has
made the flower of his collar. This is my good fortune that he has chosen me. Those who fade from the heart,
find a place in it. I understand your pain. You better stay within your limits. I don’t need to stay within my limits, you do. Those who couldn't make their own home can't bear to see someone else making theirs. So right. I will not let you make your home. I will rest when I get you out of Ghaznavi’s life. You've already tried so hard. If there's still a desire left, try once more. Get out. Get out of here. I really like seeing this envy of yours. Ghaznavi has confessed in front of me that he doesn’t love you. No one understands this better than me. If you understood it, then also accept it. The sooner you accept it, the more peace you will find. What if you lose your mind? Neither have I lost nor will I ever lose. Do you hear that? The sooner you accept it, the more peace you will find. What if you lose your mind? What to do? Pick up my phone. Pick up my phone. Ghaznavi, answer my phone! What to do now? What to do? What to do? I really like seeing
this envy of yours. Ghaznavi has confessed
in front of me that he doesn’t love you. No one understands this better than me. If you understood it, then also accept it. The sooner you accept it, the more peace you will find. What if you lose your mind? What did you do? You have fixed the wedding for so soon? This is not a wedding of dolls. Sumbul is our daughter. I am worried about
how everything will be done so soon. Hey… Thank you, child. Don’t worry, everything will get done. But how will it get done? Mama is right. We have very little time. Hey, Hassam has said that he doesn’t need dowry of any kind. We should just send Sumbul with them, that is enough. Okay, it is really good that they are refusing to take dowry. But despite that, we cannot send her away
empty-handed like this. Sarfaraz is right. Even if they have
lived abroad all their life and they will also take
Sumbul along with them, they are still human. What if, after going there they taunt my daughter
for not bringing anything, then? What is this? Such a light set. thin like a feather. We didn’t ask your
parents for anything, but they crossed all limits. Did you just bring this or
is there something else too? Huh? That’s all there is. What was the need for this, even? They should have married
off their daughter in one dress. Hey, even I understand
these worldly affairs. Instead of spending on dowry items, we'll give her the cash directly. She can buy whatever
she wants when she gets there. Yes, this is fine. Fine, then. Sumbul and I will go for
the clothes shopping. Rest, you people take care of the food
and hall arrangements. Hey, you don’t need to
worry about the hall. Sarfaraz and I will take care
of all those arrangements. You just do one thing, take Sumbul along with you. Buy whatever clothes you
want to get from the market. Also, take daughter Fiza along. Also, get something for her. No, I have clothes. Child, everyone has clothes, but you are our daughter-in-law and it is the occasion of the wedding and you too should have
some new clothes. I will give you money. You go along and get something that you like. Okay. Okay, where is Sumbul? She is in her room. She was saying she had a headache. Hey, you should have told me earlier. If she is not well, we will take her to the doctor. No. No. Once she has tea, she will be fine. Do one thing, make tea and take it to her room, and along with it give her
a tablet for the headache. Sure. Yes, see. If we need to take her to the doctor, I will take her. Ask her. Okay. There must be some valid
reason for your refusal, right? The only reason is that I don’t want to get married right now, and I don’t want to go that far away. This is not that big of a reason. No one will agree. Look Sumbul, you can talk about anything to me. Say whatever is in your heart. You can trust me. Here, take the medication. What happened? Are you really unwell? I am alive. Why are you saying this? If you are really unwell, then we will go to the hospital. I am really heartbroken, sister-in-law. Why are you saying this? Did you not look at Fahad
properly out of shyness? He is so good-looking. I was thinking you must be really happy. Every girl doesn’t have such a good fate. Such a good boy. Home. Everyone doesn’t get
everything together. I’ve never been one of those girls who sigh over relationships from abroad. Yes, I know this. But it is also possible that the one you marry, they get a chance to
go abroad after marriage. Even then you have to go
along with them, right? If you marry the person you like, you can be happy even in the jungle. A person you like? Sumbul, did I correctly hear what you are saying? I like someone, sister-in-law. So, does anyone at home know this? I am only telling you. You should have told us about this. I thought there was time
for me to get married. I will tell everyone
when the time is right. But this proposal came suddenly. It’s really stressful, and now that the wedding
date is suddenly set, what will you do? I don’t know anything. My head is exploding
thinking about this. Okay. Okay. You please don’t worry, okay? We will think of something. First tell me, who is the boy? Where did you meet him? And is he even serious
about marriage or not? Khizar. Khizar is a police inspector. We became friends
at my college function. He is a really good boy, sister-in-law. He is really serious about me. The proposal seems satisfactory
according to what you have told me. I don’t think we will find
a reason to reject him. Tell him to bring his family tomorrow. That’s the issue. He cannot send the proposal right now. What does this mean? If he is serious about marrying you, then why can he not send the proposal? Khizar has two elder sisters, who are unmarried. He cannot talk about his marriage. And did you tell him about
your wedding date getting fixed? What was his reaction? He is really worried. He is constantly saying that I should say no to this proposal. This way it will get really late Sumbul. And who knows, tomorrow you might be waiting for him, and in the end, all you
are left with is just the wait. I don’t understand anything, sister-in-law. Sister-in-law, you come with me. Meet Khizar once. If you make Khizar understand, he will understand. Please Me? Sister-in-law,
I cannot be brave like you. Like you, I cannot marry
a person I don’t know. What do you think? Do I not see how Brother rebukes you? He scolds on small things. He doesn’t care for you at all. No, sister-in-law, I cannot marry someone
who I don’t know, and neither do I love. Khizar and I really love each other. And we? We will stay really happy with each other. Please, sister-in-law, don’t say no. Help me. Please, sister-in-law. Okay, you take the medicine. We will think something about this. Since you have people to talk to, what’s the need for me? She is committing suicide for you. Make her yours, she’ll be happy, and so will you. Dua, I only love you. Then why do you go to her? Why is she calling you? If she is so important to you, then go to her, make her yours, and leave me. Enough! I am sorry. There is no need for that. Then? Then what? Won’t you forgive me? You have not done anything you need to apologize for. No, I said a lot of useless things. Hah. When are you useless? I am useless in your eyes. The ones who make claims
of love are not that weak. That’s not how it is. Then how is it? You said that you wouldn’t have
any connection with Farah, but still, you kept going to her house repeatedly. I felt that… That I love her even today. I want to make her mine, right? That’s what you felt, right? If this is the case, then who can stop me? I admit that I am helpless in your matter. I love you very much and can’t live without you. But if you don’t want to be with me, then you are free to go. Madam, should I serve food? Madam. Madam. Madam. Madam. Oh. I’m scared. If tomorrow you end up leaving me either because you’ve
grown tired of me or due to some pressure, then I might end up going back to Zunaira. I would want you not to
take Zunaira’s name again. Consider your past as
a bad dream and forget it. Your companionship is a beautiful dream for me, but still I have a fear. Why? Don’t you have faith in me? I do. I have a lot of faith in you. But I am scared of my fate. You are really weird. What do you mean? Meaning…weird. At times I don’t understand if I should respect you
more or love you more. Whatever you feel like. I promise, neither of the two will ever get reduced.
