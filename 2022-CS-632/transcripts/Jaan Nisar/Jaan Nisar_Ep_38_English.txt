Where is Khizer? I don’t know, he was saying I am just 
5 minutes away, on my way. See, we might be late. Even the messages aren’t 
getting delivered now. I guess there are signal issues here. 
Sister-in-law, shall I go out and talk? Yes, go quickly. Greetings. Greetings. I am sure you must be sister-in-law Fiza. Yes. The way Sumbul has introduced you, I can’t make any mistake in recognizing you. Can I sit here if you allow it? Yes, yes, why not? Sit. Sister-in-law, Sumbul? She just went out to call you,
 there were some signal issues here. Okay Actually, sister-in-law, I barely get 
any time while I am on duty, I came because you called me, sorry, 
Sumbul wanted me to meet you. Hey, where have you brought me? Prawn karahi is amazing here, you just try it, 
and you will praise it then. Let’s see what your prawn karahi is like. Come. I do have an idea why Sumbul 
wants me to meet you. She must have told you, there is a proposal being 
considered for her. Her wedding is being fixed, just consider it has already been fixed. Yes, she told me. So, won’t you take a stand? I am helpless, for God’s sake, 
don’t think I am careless, I need some time, 
I cannot marry right now. How dare you talk about marriage? Who are you? Yeah? I can also take you to the police station 
for raising your hand on a policeman. You must be a policeman at your home, how dare you have an affair with her? Sarfaraz? Sarfaraz, please. You fool me and come to meet him? Since when has this been going on? You are getting it wrong, 
there is nothing like that. Yes, you would say 
there is nothing like that, you are as characterless as your sister. I will look after you when I get home, first let me get done with your lover. You are having a misunderstanding. Yes, yes, you will say this 
now that you are caught. If I don’t get you out of your uniform 
by making your video viral on social media, I will change my name! Kindly don’t do this sir, 
it is becoming an issue, please. Listen to me, let’s sit and talk. 
Brother, brother? Make him understand. You, what are you doing here? Brother, let’s go home and talk. Sarfaraz please don’t put up a show here, please, let’s go.
Please take him, I am on duty, 
so it can be a problem for me, we can talk later. Brother, brother, 
let’s go home and talk. Whatever we will talk,
 we will talk here. Brother, let’s go home and talk, 
please, let’s go right now, brother, let’s go home and talk, I will tell you 
everything, please let’s go home. Jaffar? Yes, Madam? You will still stay quiet, even after knowing 
that I know everything. What should I say, madam? Are you unaware or 
are you pretending to be unaware? No, madam, why would I do that? He goes with you to Farah, right? Yes. So, do you think this is right? Don’t you stop him? Sir is very simple, he doesn’t understand anyone’s cleverness. And yes, madam Farah is not good for him. So why don’t you tell him this? I can’t. Sir is sir, I am very concerned for him, that is why I am requesting you. What request? You are sensible, you are Sir’s wife and 
the landlady of this house, you must show off your right to him. Come inside, I will teach you a lesson. 
Brother, please brother, brother leave sister-in-law, brother. Brother please, brother. 
All your reality is in front of everyone now. Sister-in-law? Control, control your daughter-in-law, who was jeopardizing 
your honor sitting with her lover. What? That is why she took you? Hey, you want to spoil 
my daughter as well? I will kill you. What are you doing? 
Mom, leave her. Hey, move back! Sarfaraz, tell me what is the matter? I will tell you in detail 
but before that let me… Hey move back! What is this madness? Dad, I have only fulfilled 
this relationship because of you, only because of you but if I see her wandering outside 
with boys, I will… Hey, I asked you to move back and talk! When Sarfaraz is saying he has caught Fiza red-handed, you are still not believing your son. You are defending her? 
Her? yeah? Quiet! Tell me, Fiza, what Sarfaraz is saying, 
is that true? Here, Dad, her silence is telling everything. This is her answer. Fiza, I have asked you a question, answer me. Hey, how will she answer? Has a robber ever admitted 
that they have robbed? She will admit everything when 
she gets slapped by Sarfaraz twice or thrice. Enough, Dad, enough, I will not tolerate her for a moment more. She is as disgusting as her sister. Today I will…
Brother! Sister-in-law did go to meet Khizer, 
yes, she did. See, see, the truth is out are you satisfied now? Is your wish fulfilled now? But not for herself but for me. Sumbul? No, Sister-in-law, let me say it. Sumbul?
No, sister-in-law, no, sister-in-law is not as bad as 
the allegation you are putting against her. Brother has crossed all the limits,
 he has crossed the limits today. So then where did both of you 
go using the market as an excuse? Sister-in-law went to meet Khizer
 because I asked her to. Who is this Khizer? Khizer is an inspector 
in the police department, I and Khizer like each other. I, I, I wanted you all to meet Khizer but before that, I wanted sister in law to meet him because Khizer cannot marry right now, he has a lot of responsibilities of his sisters. You guys put me under a lot of pressure 
by bringing Fahad’s proposal in between, I was helpless so I told 
everything to sister-in-law and then I forced sister-in-law 
myself and took her so sister-in-law could force Khizer and 
Khizer comes with the proposal soon, that is why we went there 
and brother saw us, the rest, whatever happened 
is in front of you all. Sumbul, what rubbish are you talking? 
Have you gone mad? No, no, my daughter is not like this, she is, she is being provoked 
by her and saying all this. My daughter is not like this,
 it’s her, it’s her. Have some fear of God, Mom. Don’t put more accusations 
against sister-in-law. The poor woman is quiet because of me, she is quiet because of my honor, 
she is not saying anything. I can’t let her suffer more loss, I cannot, the truth is what I told you. My child, if you liked someone, why didn’t you come and talk to me? You have stained your honor by doing this and you also compromised 
your sister-in-law’s honor. I have made a mistake, Dad. No, my child, you haven’t made a mistake, 
it’s my fault that I didn't raise both of you well. And you, why are you standing quietly now? You were bragging about 
your manliness a lot at that time, for your wife you had to break her legs, you wanted to slap her, 
and pull her hair, yeah? Now, when your sister has 
accepted everything, so break her legs, break her legs! Pull her hair! Slap her! Show your manliness! You disgusting man! Let’s go, sister-in-law. Your son acts like such a warrior, control him! Enough, Kashmala, come sit with me, I don’t like my daughter-in-law 
massaging my legs like this. Amma Saeein, I like it. Stay blessed. Amma Saeein, you, 
what do you think, Sir will fix himself and 
not meet Farah anymore? That is what I expect of Nosherwan but Farah is a very clever girl that is why I have asked Dua to 
beware and keep an eye on her husband. And do you think Dua can save Sir from Farah? Yes, that is what I think so. She didn’t even know until I mentioned it. She got really shocked after hearing it but she is courageous so she controlled herself. Nosherwan has chosen a very sensible girl. Amma Saeein, you really, you have started to really like 
your younger daughter-in-law. Kashmala, no matter how much I like her but she can never take your place. You will always be our first and 
the elder daughter-in-law of this mansion. You are just saying it 
to make me feel better, right? Why are you insecure all the time? Yeah? I, I don’t like it when you praise Dua. Okay, I won’t, just don’t cry, I feel hurt. Did the pain in your legs get better? Obviously, the pain will get better if my daughter-in-law
will massage it with so much love. But leave now, it’s enough. Let your uncle go, someone is waiting for him over there. Who is waiting for you, uncle? The one who is dearer to him 
than us and everyone else. Saying such things in front of 
the children doesn’t suit you. And what you have done 
by bringing her between us? We never had anything between us that her being between us 
is hurting you so much. Sorry, sister-in-law, you had to bear so much 
because of me. Why did you say the truth 
in front of everyone? What else would I do? Should I let you be the target 
of brother’s oppression? When you kept my honor then how can I break your trust? But I couldn’t be of any use to you, everything went wrong 
and revealed the truth. It’s good that all that was revealed 
which I always wanted to say but I couldn’t. But this is not what we wanted, Sumbul, everything went wrong. What happened with you was so wrong, you are so hurt, you should have pulled my hair and you are still thinking about me? Where are such sisters-in-law who take so much care of their 
sisters-in-law and think so much for them? You are very precious, sister-in-law. Are you mad? Hmm? You are dear to me like my sisters. Your respect has increased 
even more for me. Dad is still upset with you? You have brought your daughter 
in the court rail again? I am telling you our Sumbul is innocent. This girl has filled her mind 
with all this stupidity, otherwise, my daughter? My daughter wasn’t like this, 
has she ever done this? Ever since this evil girl
 came into this house, the environment of our house has changed. Please don’t say anything to sister-in-law. We shouldn’t say anything to her? Yeah? And you, since when have you become so bold? And don’t you have any shame? That your brother is standing here, 
your father is here and you are telling us about 
your relationship with some man? Mom is right, you have been influenced by someone. I will see her once your problem is solved. I, I, I have been in contact with 
Khizer for past two years. That’s it, no one will say anything now. If you have known him for two years, why didn’t you introduce him to us? I was waiting for the right time and Khizer refused to meet you guys because of his sisters’ responsibilities. So then, it’s fine, this ends here. If he has refused to meet us then 
why should we meet him? Okay, I admit he has his sisters’ responsibilities
on his shoulders but at least he can meet us. Maybe. Ask Khizer to meet me. What’s the need to meet him? Look, he didn’t look right to me. And when Fahad is here and 
we are talking to him about marriage so where did he come from? And what does she know 
about good or bad anyway? Talk about Fahad. Look, it doesn’t make any difference 
whether you like him or not, he is Sumbul’s choice and Sumbul has to live her life with him. But what will you say to brother Hassam? You are friends with him, it will ruin your friendship and this Sumbul, she is naïve, she doesn’t know about her 
good and bad, if she marries Fahad,
she will settle in America, she will stay happy there, happy. You don’t worry about brother Hassam, I will talk to him myself. And it was different earlier, I didn’t know that 
my daughter likes someone but now that I know, my daughter will marry 
where she wants, do you understand? Forgive me, Dad. My child, daughters don’t look good 
when they cry. Stay happy, my child, stay happy. Do you see him? Hey, I have been seeing him 
since God knows when. Where is Dua? Sir, Madam has refused to eat. Why? When did she have lunch? Sir, she didn’t even have lunch and I guess she didn’t even have breakfast. Dua hasn’t eaten since morning 
and you are telling me now? You said it in front of Baba Saaein 
and Amma Saeein that you have no place for her 
in your heart so then why, why do you go running to her 
when she calls you once? On humanitarian grounds. She could have died. But she didn’t die. 
Okay, enough! You won’t keep any terms with her, 
you won’t go there. I will be in terms with her, till you have some connection with her,
I will stay in terms with her. And, and why shouldn’t I talk to her? She can destroy my home and I will just watch in the corner 
as a silent spectator? Your home is not that weak, Dua, that it can break if anyone tries a little. Why aren’t you eating? I am not hungry. May I ask the reason 
why you are not hungry? Farah. You are escalating the fight 
between us by saying all this. I am escalating it? Or you don’t want to come out of her trap? Dua? 
Dua, what? If that’s not how it is, why does she contact you? Why does she take pills to commit suicide? If you have refused her so many times
 that you don’t love her, why isn’t she losing hope? You should have asked her 
when you went to her place. Both of you are really disliking that 
I went there once and asked her something. Do you want to end this here or not? It will end when you stop going to her 
and she stops contacting you. Come, eat. I will eat when I am hungry, you go and spend the night attending to Farah because she already got saved by 
cutting her wrist, taking sleeping pills, and attempting so many things 
to commit suicide, I am afraid she might 
shoot herself this time and her dream of committing 
suicide gets fulfilled. So, you just keep on sitting with her, hmm? Because nothing is more important 
for you than her life.
