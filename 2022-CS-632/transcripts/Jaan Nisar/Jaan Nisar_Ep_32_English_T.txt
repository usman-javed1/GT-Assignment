[62.68] How do you feel, now?
[65.96] I saw you,
[68.20] I feel really good.
[72.84] What was this?
[76.24] I had told you,
[79.44] I would not be able 
to live without you.
[81.08] So much madness
 is not good, Farah.
[83.96] Yes, I am mad for you.
[92.00] I have tolerated
 distances from you once,
[96.44] but if you leave me and go again,
[98.32] then I will not be able to tolerate it.
[116.40] Look, Farah, I have told you that…
[117.84] I don’t know anything.
[120.72] If I know something, then it is this,
[122.28] that I will not be able
 to live without you.
[132.96] But still, if
[133.76] you don’t care a little about my life,
[136.00] fine,
[139.80] you can leave me and go.
[154.60] What is the guarantee that
[155.76] I will go from here
[156.56] and you will not do this again?
[161.76] There is no guarantee
[165.28] because I don’t want to 
live without you.
[226.44] More precious than life, Dua.
[229.12] Since I've seen you,
[231.08] I'm unaware of day or night.
[234.12] I am lost in thoughts 
of you all the time,
[237.08] as if I've detached from the world,
[238.40] with only thoughts of you remaining.
[240.44] I have fallen in love with you.
[242.56] I have fallen in love with you.
[294.80] I will wear this suit.
[296.68] It is like this color 
has been made for me.
[311.80] What are you looking at?
[316.40] You people have still kept 
my things the same.
[320.56] Why shouldn’t we have?
[322.56] Did you get separated from us?
[328.28] Yes, but,
[331.20] I was just afraid
[335.28] you people too would 
think I am the sinner.
[338.52] Have you gone mad?
[346.88] It was my fault as well, Fiza.
[352.68] You just made the mistake of 
loving someone with flaws.
[357.76] Whatever happened to you,
[360.64] someone else's malicious intentions 
were involved in it.
[366.76] Dua,
[368.72] when God has blessed 
you so much, then
[372.76] you too forget that accident 
as a nightmare.
[380.84] It doesn’t matter what the world 
thinks or what people will say,
[386.56] because you are still the same
 old Dua for us, today.
[390.52] Okay?
[392.08] Our Dua. My Dua.
[403.28] Sister, come, tea is ready.
[406.32] Hey, so soon?
[408.16] I am sure you made really bad tea.
[410.24] No, why?
[411.00] She made it with so much love,
[412.24] with so much heart,
[413.12] with her own hands.
[414.08] Really?
[415.00] Then I will have to drink it and see.
[416.92] Come on, let’s go.
[419.96] Come on.
[420.68] Yes, I am coming.
[432.96] Be careful.
[439.20] I am telling you, be careful.
[440.80] Sorry.
[444.32] Sit here carefully.
[455.36] Now rest,
[456.72] I will order something for you to eat.
[533.64] Come on, now drink the soup,
[534.56] then you also have to take
 your medicine as well.
[536.24] My heart doesn’t feel like it.
[538.32] If you listen to your heart
[539.56] then how will the wound heal?
[541.60] Who wants to heal the wound?
[543.88] What is this?
[546.04] You will have to get fine.
[549.00] If I get fine,
[549.92] then you will not 
care for me like this.
[552.68] That’s why I don’t want to get fine.
[557.96] Come on.
[564.16] Drink it. Come on.
[578.92] Come on.
[584.76] That’s it.
[585.92] At least drink half of it.
[587.40] I even drank this 
much in your love,
[591.20] or else I didn’t feel like it at all.
[603.64] Here you go.
[617.28] Thank you.
[621.60] Are you feeling better now?
[624.76] Much better.
[626.08] Hmmm.
[628.00] Okay, you rest. I will go now.
[631.24] Stay for some time.
[633.00] I cannot stay, Farah.
[634.00] What is wrong with you?
[635.60] Stay for a little while.
[651.96] Hey, Sakina.
[654.44] Yes? Yes, madam?
[656.12] Is Ghaznavi back?
[657.40] No, sir hasn’t come home yet.
[660.92] Okay,
[661.88] did he call for me?
[663.44] No, he didn’t call either.
[666.92] Fine, you can leave.
[668.28] Okay.
[691.04] Can you not stay?
[694.80] It is necessary for me to go.
[698.68] Go after a little while.
[700.64] When I have to leave,
[701.52] then what is a little while
 earlier or little while later?
[705.52] I need you right now.
[707.76] Till now,
[708.68] my wound hasn’t even healed.
[712.04] Now, you should have thought 
about this before doing this.
[717.88] Has anyone ever thought and loved?
[723.96] You had left this love a long time back.
[731.48] Now, if someone has taken your place,
[735.24] then tolerate it.
[738.40] If I could tolerate it,
[740.72] then would have taken 
such an extreme step?
[743.20] Listen, Farah,
[746.16] I have promised Dua that
[747.72] I will never cheat her.
[752.44] And I mean it.
[753.16] I will never cheat her.
[756.24] You had also made 
a promise to me too, right?
[758.44] It is in the past, forget it now.
[762.20] You can forget it
[764.44] because you had left
 me mid-way and left.
[767.64] I am still there.
[769.40] Even today, I am only yours and
[771.92] I want to be yours.
[773.64] Yes, but my destination
 is someone else now.
[778.72] You don’t feel pity for me at all?
[783.20] I think you need to rest.
[787.32] I will tell Jaffar to arrange
 a maid for you.
[790.32] She will take care of you.
[791.44] Only you can take care of me.
[797.48] Fine.
[799.48] If you want to enforce a maid on me,
[803.60] then I accept this too.
[807.96] I will get the arrangement made.
[810.96] Take care.
[811.68] You will have to come again
[813.68] because
[814.88] I cannot control the 
madness inside me for long.
[823.24] Hmm?
[825.16] Goodbye.
[826.68] I will wait for you.
[879.04] Greetings, madam.
[880.44] Greetings.
[881.68] Where is Ghaznavi?
[884.20] He is in a meeting.
[888.84] At this time?
[891.28] He comes home by this time.
[893.20] Yes, an urgent meeting came up,
[894.84] that’s why.
[895.76] Okay,
[897.24] till when will he be free?
[898.64] He might just get free or
[901.48] it can take one or two hours.
[904.84] Oh.
[906.40] Yes, he is here.
[909.24] Madam is on the call.
[910.12] I am just coming home.
[911.44] Yes, madam,
[912.48] he is coming home.
[915.76] Fine.
[940.44] Your coffee.
[944.36] Coffee.
[948.08] Yes, thank you.
[949.48] What happened?
[950.00] What are you thinking?
[952.80] Nothing.
[954.96] If something is worrying you,
[956.04] you can share it with me.
[959.76] There is no worry.
[963.72] You know,
[964.76] I forgot to check my phone
 in my happiness.
[971.12] And when I checked it,
[972.20] I didn’t like it at all.
[973.44] There was no call or
 message from you.
[981.88] When I called
[983.00] your number was off as well.
[989.60] But, the good thing is that
[990.64] Jaffar told me you 
are in a meeting.
[993.84] Yes,
[994.56] at times, such emergency
 meetings come, so…
[1004.28] You tell me,
[1005.92] how do you feel 
meeting your own?
[1009.40] Me?
[1011.68] I feel, really, really, 
really, really, really, good.
[1019.64] It feels as though,
[1021.00] I met my own after a long time.
[1025.20] Sania,
[1026.32] Fiza,
[1027.04] Mama, everyone was really happy.
[1028.72] Really, really happy.
[1031.32] And your Papa?
[1044.96] He didn’t agree.
[1048.64] He too will agree.
[1054.92] At least, this much happened that
[1056.24] he let you come inside,
[1057.96] he let you meet everyone.
[1062.00] All this is because of you.
[1064.88] What did I do?
[1068.60] Yesterday's Dua was nameless,
[1070.56] insignificant.
[1076.72] The position I have achieved
 today is because of you.
[1082.84] Now, before anyone points
 a finger at me,
[1088.84] they think a hundred times.
[1091.88] Because you are Nosherwan
 Ghaznavi’s respect.
[1101.48] Are you happy with me?
[1105.96] With you?
[1108.12] I am really, really, really, happy.
[1132.52] You had also made 
a promise to me too, right?
[1134.56] It is in the past, forget it now.
[1136.88] You can forget it
[1139.48] because you had left me
 mid-way and left.
[1142.48] I am still there.
[1144.16] Even today, I am only yours and
[1146.76] I want to be yours.
[1148.36] Yes, but my destination 
is someone else now.
[1152.04] You don’t feel pity for me at all?
[1224.24] Yes,
[1224.72] what is the price of the apples?
[1226.36] Sir it is three hundred rupees,
[1227.28] but you take it for two fifty rupees.
[1229.08] Two fifty rupees? Fear God.
[1230.84] And this papaya?
[1232.72] It is three hundred rupees for a kilo.
[1234.32] Three hundred rupees?
[1235.48] I got it last week
[1237.04] for one fifty rupees.
[1238.40] Leave it, man,
[1239.20] you will not buy it.
[1239.88] Brother,
[1241.20] what is cheap and what 
is expensive for you?
[1244.04] What do you mean?
[1245.04] Meaning?
[1246.04] Oh, the way your daughter
 arrived in that big car,
[1249.32] and the guards with her,
[1252.16] it will be amusing to 
see you argue like this.
[1256.16] Neither did the car belong to me,
[1257.20] nor the guards. Understand?
[1259.20] It belonged to 
your daughter, right?
[1260.36] It is the same thing.
[1262.00] Hey, we even saw the time
[1263.76] when you didn’t let your 
daughter enter your home.
[1266.80] And we also saw with 
our own eyes
[1268.84] the force she showed 
and entered the home.
[1272.36] Now the neighbors are saying
[1274.32] that your daughter
 has become very arrogant.
[1277.48] How she was threatening
 in front of everyone
[1280.52] that no one could stop 
her from coming home.
[1282.76] And listen,
[1283.60] did you ask her
[1285.44] where she ran away to?
[1287.40] And that police station?
[1290.20] Listen to me.
[1291.40] The daughter is mine,
[1292.76] the problem is of my home,
[1294.28] why do you have a problem?
[1296.36] I am just talking,
[1297.40] you are getting upset for no reason.
[1299.12] You are talking. You are talking.
[1300.72] Don’t talk to me.
[1301.96] And listen to me,
[1303.44] don’t make me speak up now.
[1305.00] Your daughter got caught with 
the electrician on the roof one year back,
[1308.60] did I talk about it?
[1310.12] Should I tell everyone
[1311.68] what she was doing with
 the electrician on the roof?
[1314.16] Hey, just because 
I mentioned your daughter,
[1315.88] you started dwelling in the past.
[1317.60] Yes, so should I not?
[1318.92] You will put salt in my wound,
[1320.88] then I will also say a lot to you.
[1322.52] Hey, leave it. 
It is useless to talk to you.
[1324.72] Leave it.
[1324.88] Go, then.
[1325.88] Leave it, man.
[1326.32] Get lost. Go.
[1332.12] Yes, Brother,
[1333.12] how much do you want?
[1334.20] Yes, how much is it for?
[1336.20] Hey, I just told you,
[1337.16] it is three hundred rupees for a kilo.
[1338.40] It is really expensive,
 I don’t want to get it.
[1342.44] God will question you.
[1390.76] Madam, do you want something?
[1392.56] No, no, I don’t want anything.
[1394.44] I just want to make 
food that Ghaznavi likes.
[1396.80] Food that sir likes?
[1398.64] Yes.
[1399.60] So you tell me,
[1400.88] I will cook everything.
[1402.24] Hey, I told you,
[1404.40] I would make lunch for Ghaznavi.
[1406.24] Madam,
[1407.04] if sir finds out that you worked,
[1409.12] then he will not like it.
[1411.12] Why do you worry?
[1412.64] Just tell me,
[1413.68] where is everything kept?
[1415.04] Help me.
[1416.08] So that I can make the food.
[1418.16] Okay, I will tell you,
[1419.20] then you take care of everything.
[1421.56] Fine.
[1422.44] I will take care of it,
[1423.20] you don’t worry.
[1423.76] Tell me, what is in the fridge?
[1425.52] The fridge has chicken, beef,
[1427.36] and even fish.
[1429.36] There is everything…
[1443.48] Madam.
[1445.44] Yes, go ahead.
[1446.56] How do I have to give
 you this medication?
[1450.76] You should have asked the one 
who had told you to give me the medication.
[1458.00] I am not sitting here 
to dictate to you.
[1460.68] If you tell me once,
[1462.24] then I will be careful going forward.
[1467.32] Keep it here,
[1468.64] and leave.
[1469.44] I will have it myself.
[1484.12] Now why are you standing
 here, staring at me?
[1487.56] I told you to leave.
[1488.72] I will have it. Leave.
[1495.60] Go,
[1496.36] open the door.
[1498.20] It must be your sir,
[1499.32] and bring him straight here.
[1501.36] Go.
[1502.72] Sure.
[1533.72] You?
[1535.16] Yes. Me.
[1538.28] Sir has sent some fruits and
[1540.24] he has also told me to
 find out how you are.
[1544.60] Could your sir not come himself?
[1546.96] He was busy.
[1548.80] Hmm.
[1550.72] I know about his busyness.
[1553.56] This is Bano.
[1555.20] She has my number.
[1556.56] If you need anything,
[1558.40] then call me.
[1560.24] Has your sir put all the
 responsibilities on your head?
[1563.56] Now sir has not been made
 for these small tasks.
[1572.08] Fine. Leave.
[1575.04] I will call you.
[1580.16] Take good care of madam.
[1586.40] This is sir’s order.
[1588.60] Don’t worry.
[1592.04] Keep it here.
[1615.16] Who told you to bring him here?
[1617.64] Madam, you had 
said that sir has come,
[1620.12] I should bring him inside.
[1621.32] Is this your sir?
[1622.68] Yes.
[1623.48] He is the one
 who employed me with you.
[1628.08] Oh.
[1629.40] You get lost from here,
[1630.32] or else the veins of 
my brain will explode.
[1632.32] Go from here.
[1634.68] Sure.
[1684.48] Hello.
[1685.36] Where are you?
[1687.88] In your heart.
[1698.64] Okay come on, let’s have food.
[1703.20] This is great.
[1705.64] First the invitation for
 lunch at home,
[1707.04] then all this arrangement.
[1708.92] Is there something 
special about today?
[1711.84] When I prepare something for you,
[1713.04] it will be special, right?
[1715.80] You made all this?
[1717.28] Hmm.
[1718.32] What was the need for
 you to go in the kitchen?
[1720.68] Did you burn your hand?
[1721.56] Show me.
[1722.40] No, nothing happened.
[1724.36] Thank God nothing happened,
[1725.64] but had something 
happened, then?
[1727.36] And what was the need for 
you to go to the kitchen?
[1729.04] One minute,
[1729.40] let me teach Sakina a lesson.
[1730.44] Sakina.
[1731.08] Please. Please. Please.
[1731.68] Don’t say anything to her.
[1732.96] She was telling me not to and
[1734.88] she was also really scared,
[1735.56] that you would scold her.
[1737.00] Please. I insisted.
[1741.64] What was the need for you 
to tire yourself like this?
[1744.12] Hey, when did I get tired?
[1745.80] I was making it for you with my interest
[1748.96] and I liked it.
[1751.44] But,
[1752.64] instead of eating the food,
[1754.28] and praising it,
[1755.80] you started investigating.
[1759.32] I am not investigating,
[1760.28] I was worried about you.
[1762.28] What if you had gotten harmed?
[1766.08] Can I ever get harmed with you there?
[1770.80] Never.
[1772.76] But so much…
[1774.76] No, ifs and buts. Nothing.
[1777.68] You do one thing.
[1778.80] This is your favorite.
[1780.84] In fact, I will serve it to you.
[1783.52] Eat it. Tell me, how is it?
[1786.88] Okay then,
[1787.40] you have made
 it with so much love,
[1788.76] so I will have to eat it.
[1808.80] How is it?
[1811.64] Hmm. It is fine.
[1814.68] It is just fine.
[1817.60] It is okay.
[1820.88] Okay, leave it, then.
[1822.56] I will tell Sakina,
[1823.28] she will make something.
[1826.52] I am joking it is really delicious.
[1827.64] You are not joking.
[1828.56] I promise, it is really delicious.
[1832.40] Are you sure?
[1833.84] Promise.
[1835.68] It is really delicious.
[1838.36] Then eat more.
[1840.00] I will.
[1843.64] That’s it.
[1844.52] This means,
[1845.24] it is not good. See!
[1847.04] It is really delicious, but
[1847.96] you have made so many things.
[1849.28] I will eat those too.
[1851.52] You sure, right?
[1852.76] It is really very delicious.
[1854.96] What more will you have?
[1855.80] I will try the biryani.
[1861.80] Dish it out on your plate.
[1912.12] Okay, I will go back 
to the office now.
[1913.76] We will meet in the evening.
[1915.00] The office, again?
[1916.56] Yes, man, some work is left.
[1919.24] I forgot an important 
file in the morning,
[1920.92] I will bring it from the room.
[1922.88] I will bring it.
[1937.04] Three missed calls?
[1946.04] Hello.
[1947.48] Despite knowing my condition,
[1950.20] you didn’t even come to see
[1951.72] whether I am alive or dead.
[1955.40] I had told Jaffar,
[1956.80] he must have found
 a maid for you till now.
[1959.00] Yes,
[1960.72] the maid sent by your 
servant has arrived,
[1967.52] and also the things
 you sent with your servant Jaffar.
[1975.48] Now, I have become 
so insignificant in your eyes,
[1977.64] that you’ve left me at 
the mercy of the servants.
[1980.96] I was busy.
[1982.36] You were busy.
