What is this trouble? Where is she? Hey, how would I know? Fiza. She must be dressing up to go to school. Hey, when she comes back 
from school herself, then let her go herself too. Why have you clung her on to me? Hey, it is your father’s orders. What do I say? Papa is just… He has given this girl undue importance. Fiza. Yes. Yes. I am here. I mean, should I do a job or should I act as her driver? What is this? When you know your husband has to go with you, that's when your antics start. No, it took me time to 
clean up the kitchen. Sorry. Okay, enough. No need to give your 
husband the impression that we make you 
do the work at home, and also a job. And yes, come home early, don't go sit with your mother. You know we have guests coming over, and we need to prepare everything. Yes. Yes, I will come straight home. And you. You too try to come early 
from the office as well. Brother Hassam is
 coming after a lot of years, I want us to give him a good gift. So, you go and bring a gift from the market. Also, take Fiza along. Yes, Mama, I will come. First, let me go. Come on, before she remembers some other work. Goodbye. Come straight home, okay? Lazy. Kashmala, what have you done to yourself? God forbid, what has happened that you don’t take care of yourself? You are young, you are beautiful and your husband is there with you. What do I care about, Amma Saeein? You, yourself say a wife is blessed if her husband likes her. Yes. That’s why we try to tell 
you again and again, that if you agree, then you don’t need to live like this. I can get you married somewhere else. Amma Saeein, I am not a sheep or a goat, that I am taken from one post 
and tied to another, and I don’t even feel anything. Kashmala, try to change your heart. I won’t be able to do it, Amma Saeein. It is not possible. I know. I am very ashamed. I repeatedly feel that 
we have made a huge mistake. If, after Zawar's departure, we hadn't bound you and 
Nosherwan in this relationship, perhaps today Nosherwan 
would be happy, and you would be mentally 
prepared for someone else. I don’t know about myself, Amma Saeein, but Nosherwan is really happy. He is really happy and 
his head is in the clouds. Yes. After marrying Dua, he started to seem really happy. That’s what I don’t 
understand, Amma Saeein, whether he is happy with Dua or because Farah returned. What is the need to
 mention Farah here? Farah has come back 
into Nosherwan’s life. He is with her all day long. You see for yourself. Hey, sister, you? How is my doll? I am fine, how are you? I am also absolutely fine. You tell me, Mama… Hey, you come in. Keep it here. Okay listen, you leave. When I need you to come, I will call you. Madam, sir told us not to leave
 you alone even for a moment. We are standing outside. You can stay for as long as you want. Fine, you can go. Yes, Madam. Come on, go close the door. Come quickly and talk to me. Hello. Hello. Ghaznavi, where are you? Please, come home immediately. Why? What happened? Is everything fine? Nothing is fine here. Ouch, my foot. What has happened? Actually, I fell in the washroom and I feel that I fractured my foot. Okay, don’t worry. I am coming. Please come home quickly. It hurts a lot. I cannot tolerate it. I am coming. I am coming. Take the car to Farah’s home, she got hurt. What's the matter, sister? Seeing your style makes me envious. You are living a life fit for a princess. You will see, you will get married in 
a really good family. Sania, who are you talking to? It is me, Mama. Greetings. Greetings. How is my child? I am fine. How are you? I saw you, I met you, so I am good. Have a seat. Sister, what do we do with all this? What do we have to do with it? We will eat, drink, we will enjoy a lot. I am here all day long today. Yes, child. Surely stay. This is your own home. But what was the need for all this? Why was there no need? It is my own home, right? So, can I not bring it? And if you tell me not to, 
then I will get upset. Hey, no, no, I am not telling you not to, don’t get upset. Okay, tell me, what will you eat? Mama, feed me whatever you
 have cooked at home. I am really hungry. We have sliced beef, your favourite. Sliced beef? Quickly go and bring it. See, I started drooling hearing about it. I know you cannot tolerate hunger. I will bring it.  
Yes, fine. Go. Mama, will Papa come in the evening? Yes, child, he has the same routine. I am so happy, God answered my prayers. My daughter is in front 
of my eyes today. Uncle, we will not let you go anywhere. Yes. Let your uncle go. Someone is waiting for him there. Who is waiting, uncle? The one who is dearest to them, 
more than me, you, and anyone. It's inappropriate that you say 
these things in front of the children. And what about what you did bringing her between you and me? There was never anything between us, that you are so bothered
 with someone coming in between. For a moment, let's say I accept that Ghaznavi will leave me now
 that Farah has come back. But have you ever thought that even then, there will be no place for 
you in Ghaznavi's heart? Thousands like you and 
Farah come and go. I am there forever. And don’t forget that I am talking to you sitting in 
the mansion of Nosherwan’s parents. What value does that mansion have where you get nothing but loneliness? Seeing you in this role after
 seeing you as a sister-in-law will be nothing short of a test for me. If you want, you can say no to this wedding. Assuming this marriage happens, you will indeed be in my marriage, and I will fulfill your rights as a wife, but don't expect love from me. Farah. Dua. Dua. Farah. I am nowhere. I am nowhere at all. I am nowhere. What happened? How did you fall? Show me. Did you get hurt badly? I lost my balance, I couldn’t steady myself and fell. So be careful. I will call the doctor. The doctor visited and left, and he has prescribed these tests and X-rays. Then you should go to the hospital. Hey, what if you have a serious injury? What are you doing here? I didn’t have the strength. Where is Bano? Bano. At least, she should have 
called me and informed me, or she should have 
at least informed Jaffar. She went home to meet her family. And you are alone at home 
and you are telling me now? How could I tell you? Your phone is always off. Farah, how will it work like this, man? My phone will be off, often. At times I am in meetings, 
at times I am working. You will have to take 
care of yourself. You will have to manage 
things yourself, now. I cannot. You are there to care for me. After all, I get really 
alone without you. Come on, I will take
 you to the hospital. It is necessary to 
get these tests done. Careful. What happened? Now if you want to help me, do it properly. Come on. Ouch. Careful. I have to do so much to call
 you to me again and again. A day will come when I will even break Dua's spell. Then you will only be mine. I had fun, Mama. That’s it. No. No. No. My stomach is full. Tea is here. Now all of us will enjoy it together. Wow, our little one has
 become really skilled. Thank you. I had to be. After all, I was alone after you 
and sister Fiza left. Mama doesn’t stay well either, and Papa’s anger. You know how afraid I am of Papa. It was a very difficult time for us. Anyway, that time was bad for everyone. Hey, child, instead of being sad about
 past events, it’s better to be grateful for today’s happiness. You are right. I never thought I would sit with you all, 
between you all again, like this. We should never lose hope in God. He is capable of turning every
 impossibility into a possibility. No doubt. The good thing is that 
all of us are together and we are really happy. Except for sister Fiza. Why? What happened to Fiza? Her in-laws are not good at all. Uncle and Sumbul
 can still be tolerated, but Aunty and 
Brother Groom are incompatible. Sister has a lot of tolerance. They say so much but still, 
she never complains. What is their problem? Fiza is so good. After you left the house, if anyone suffered beside us, it’s Sister Fiza. They taunted her so much that 
they made her life difficult. If they find out that 
you’ve returned to us, they might even end 
her interactions with us. Sania. No Mama, let her speak. I too should hear why my sister is getting
 punished for my mistakes. This… this is nothing, sister. Brother Groom had also 
threatened sister with divorce. When you and I were going
 to become Aunts, then brother groom put such 
bad allegations on sister, that… I think that sister didn’t fall herself, she was made to fall on purpose. Enough. Mama, so much happened with Fiza, and you didn’t tell me. To the extent, that even
 Fiza didn’t say anything. Why? Our Fiza is really patient. What could I tell you? And child, even if I had told you, her loss wouldn’t have
 been redeemed. My daughter had the sorrow
 of a child in her fate, so it happened. Whatever happened, happened because of her in-laws. Okay, you have tea. It is getting cold. You tell me, where are you going? I am going home right now. You… you didn’t quit your school job? No. What happened to you? Nothing. I was a little unwell, but I am fine now. I am absolutely fine. How will you go? I will drop you home. No. No. No. We will talk and meet later. Okay, come on, give me your number. No, I don’t have a number, I don’t even have a phone, Dua. Greetings. Hey, why did you do all this? I would have come and served food. Anyway, I am done eating, ask Sumbul. Sumbul works so hard
 and cooks food just for you. So that when sister-in-law comes she doesn’t have to work hard again. She cares for you so much, so it is also your responsibility
 to take care of her. Sure. Feed her food, she was saying she is not hungry. Yes, I will do one thing, I will dish out her food along with mine. We will both eat together. Fine. And listen. Nothing should be left lacking
 with regard to tomorrow. Nothing will be left lacking. Hmm. And. And lay out the bed sheet 
we had laid out on your wedding. And also take out the new crockery. Yes, sure. And yes, I had spoken to you regarding the food, that the entire feast will be prepared. It should include biryani, korma, kebabs, raita, salad, and all the accompaniments. We spoke about all this yesterday and I had noted everything down. Hey, what will I do with you noting it? You don’t have to note it. Make a list and give it to me, so that I can get the things. And after all, Sarfaraz got a new job, I cannot make him take a day 
off from the office, right? You have to take care of everything. Yes. I will take care of everything. And yes, listen. I see a lot of webs on the roof. Clean them today, and don't postpone 
today's work to tomorrow. Understood? Sure. And yes, listen to me. Yes? Don’t tire Sumbul out by making
 her work alongside you. On such occasions, it’s the sisters-in-law who take charge and 
manage everything actively. Alright? And one more thing— praise Sumbul a lot
 in front of the guests. Understood? Obviously, Sumbul is so good. She is like my younger sister. That’s the thing. What I’m saying is that you should repeatedly
 mention in front of them that Sumbul takes great care of you, loves you very much, and treats you like a sister. She is such a friendly and lovely child. You need to say all this. Yes. Sure. Should I give Sumbul food, first? If you allow me, then can I leave? Yes, so leave. When have I tied you here? Go. Sure. You have brought all 
this to my attention and forced me to think about it. I had no other option but
 to bring it to your attention. The matter is really very complicated. Earlier, it was just Kashmala, but now it is a matter 
of two daughters-in-law. I don’t understand what Nosherwan wants. That’s what you have to 
ask him calling him here. Fine. He didn’t like Kashmala, he married her on us forcing him. Despite our opposition, he embraced the new girl with his love. Then what has happened that 
despite both of them being present, he turned his attention towards Farah? Saeein, I am really angry at Nosherwan. I didn’t expect this from him at all. Even I didn’t expect this from him. That’s why I am not able to believe 
what you have told me till now. You believing it, or not believing
 it won't change the reality. And that girl Farah? I didn’t like her from the start. Call Nosherwan and ask him what he is up to. Make him understand that this Farah is not right for him at all. She is a really cunning girl. She will sell our son and 
he will not even find out. After all, how can someone harm our son? But, I… I will talk to him and understand what he ultimately wants. This time, you won’t just talk or be lenient. You’ll need to be strict . On one hand, Kashmala is sitting with a burning heart, and now Dua? The blame will fall on our upbringing since I am the mother of Nosherwan. Why should we be the ones
 to bear the curse of two girls? Alright. Please don’t upset yourself. I told you I would talk to Nosherwan. And if he acts out of line this time, we will handle him strictly. This is the limit. Sumbul. Sumbul. Sister-in-law, why did you bring the food? Hey, I am really hungry. Come on, we will eat together. Come on. I am not hungry. Why? I am noticing that since Uncle mentioned 
the arrival of Fahad's family, your hunger and thirst have vanished. Look, it happens with every girl. Hearing about in-laws 
makes her heart very sad. Obviously, there’s a deep sorrow in 
leaving one’s own family. I am really scared, Sister-in-law. Why are you scared? We will only proceed with the proposal 
after thoroughly assessing the boy. Besides, he is a friend of Uncle. We know him. Why are you worried? You somehow find a way to cancel 
the plan of this proposal coming over. Why, Sumbul? I don’t want to get married right now. Right now, they are only coming with the proposal. You will not get married immediately. I don’t want to go so far. Hey, girls dream of having their marriage proposals 
come from England or Europe, so they can proudly 
tell their friends that after marriage, they’ll be settling in America or England. I have never had such a desire. What is the matter, Sumbul? What would be the matter? There must be a reasonable 
reason behind your refusal. The only reason is that I don't want to get married right now and I don't want to go so far. This is not that big a reason. No one will agree. Look Sumbul, you can talk to me about anything. Whatever is there in your heart, say it. You can trust me. Sister-in-law, I… Yes? Are you still not done eating? You know there is 
a feast tomorrow, right? There is so much work to be done. Yes, we were just eating. Finish your food, quickly, then come to me. Sure. This is the limit. They are having a party, and they are not worried at all. You please eat this. I will come, okay? You should have informed 
Jaffar before going on leave. Sir, Madam… Leave it, Ghanznavi. She too has to meet her family. And, after all, how was she to know
 that I would fall? She has been hired
 here to take care of you. Yes, so she cares for me. You go to the kitchen and 
make arrangements for dinner. You are not fine, anyway. A little negligence 
will make this a big issue. Nothing can happen to me with you here. I am leaving. I am getting late. Wait. Have dinner with me today. No, not today, some other time. Today. Bano is making dinner, you are having dinner with me. Why are you insisting? I am explaining something to you. You find my wish to be my insistence? Then let it be my insistence. If you go from here today, I will not eat anything. Neither food nor medicine. And you know well 
how stubborn I am. Farah what is this childish behaviour? Please grow up. Here. Take care of yourself too. You are there to take care of me. You will have to take care of yourself. You will have to manage 
things yourself, now. I cannot. You are there to care for me. After all, I get really alone without you. What happened? Where did you get lost? Huh? No, nowhere. Nowadays, you have started to stay really lost. Is it work-related stress? Yes, I am just a little busy. You came late, even last night and then you
 slept without having dinner. No, I had food with friends. Aren’t friends starting to take on
 too much importance in your life?
