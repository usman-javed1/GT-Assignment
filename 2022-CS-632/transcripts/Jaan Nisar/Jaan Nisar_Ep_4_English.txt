This place of yours has 
so much peace and beauty. Whenever I come here, I find a lot of happiness. In fact, will you always keep me
happy like this? Don’t you believe me? More than myself. I am going to change this belief 
of yours into truth. I am going to talk to Baba Saeein,
 about our proposal. Really? Really. But, if he doesn’t agree, then? Still, no one can separate me from you. Promise? I promise. And you know how steadfast
I am in my promises. You didn’t fulfill your promise, 
Nosherwan. I hate you Nosherwan. Nosherwan, don’t I even have 
this much right that I can hold your hand? I have held your hand for a lifetime, what else do you want? What are you punishing me for? What is my fault? Maybe, I am the one 
who is getting punished. You just have to live with 
this truth all your life, that you and I have a 
relationship on paper. Till how long will you mourn, 
Nosherwan? Why don’t you accept the truth? Why don’t you understand that everything will get destroyed 
in this fire of distances? Destroyed? When was I ever prosperous? You don’t have the courage 
to hear the truth. Maybe this is why 
you still have hope. How long will the two of us 
continue to fight like this? Stay peacefully, 
and also let me live. Then you too hear one thing. Understand this well. I will continue to fight with you, till the time I have hope, until there is a chance that 
I will get love from you. And the day this hope ends,
Nosherwan, I will stop talking, I will go completely quiet. Nosherwan, I love you. But, I don’t love you. Hey Sumbul, hurry up, we are getting late. And bring some earrings, 
my ears are empty. Are you people going somewhere? To see our sister-in-law. To see a sister-in-law? Yes. The wedding planner mentioned 
a really good girl. I cannot resist, 
I am going to meet her. Hey, so suddenly? You should 
have told me at least. When is it sudden? I told you that I would start 
looking for girls for you. Now, by luck we have found a good girl, so why should I delay? You come on, we are getting late. 
Come on. Hi. You are upset because 
Faraz didn’t come? No. All the boys are the same. Look at Fahad, he is Faraz’s friend. He used to say to me, that if I don’t talk to you for a moment, 
then my time doesn’t pass. See now, ten hours have passed, but he didn’t send a single message. This Faraz is exactly the same. I don’t think so. Really? If you don’t think so, 
then where is he? Why has he not come till now? He had made my life hell 
calling me repeatedly. And see now, you have been sitting here 
waiting for so long, and we don’t know the whereabouts
of that mister. I am not waiting. Hey, enough. Leave it. I know it all. You were getting so happy when you
got free from the class, and see now, you have such a sad face. I have had enough, 
I am going home. And if you want, 
then come along, or else sit and wait for Faraz. Okay. Goodbye. 
Goodbye. Sir, the hunting equipment is 
being loaded into the car. Please prepare to depart. Yes, let me just change my clothes, 
then we will go. Okay. You change your clothes. Hmmm. Uncle, we too will go hunting with you. I never went hunting. It will be a lot of fun. But children don’t go hunting. Why don’t they go? Because there are wild animals 
when you go hunting, they can harm you. So, we are not going alone, mama too is coming along with us. Yes, what else? We will hunt and also have a picnic. The children are right. So, uncle, we are going, right? Should I go put on my fairy dress? And I will go dressed as Spiderman. No, children, uncle cannot take you hunting, but I promise, 
I will take you to playland. Next time. Promise?
Pinky promise. Yay. Thank you. Whatever you are doing using 
the children as a weapon is wrong. What is wrong, Nosherwan? I want to spend some time with you. What is wrong with that? Nosherwan, no matter how much you run from me, one day, you have to come back to me. That day will never come in my life. Child, work quickly. I am doing it, mama. You are worried yourself, 
and you are also worrying us. Hey, how can I not worry? Earlier, the boy’s family was 
coming in the evening, now Naseema sent me a message
that they will reach shortly. Now, if I don’t get worried in such 
a situation, then what do I do? Hey, you don’t worry. Everything will be done
by the time they come. Hey, Fiza, you are still roaming around 
in the same getup. Leave it, I will do it. 
You go. Go and take out a good dress
 of Dua’s and wear it. Get ready. This Dua… was it necessary for her 
to go to the university today? If she was at home, 
she would have dressed you up. This is the only good thing 
she knows how to do. Mama, you call that grooming. Okay. Okay, whatever you call it. Hey, how was the poor thing 
supposed to know that the boy’s family would change 
their plan suddenly? This is what I am tensed about. I just sent Guddu from the neighborhood
 to get baked food and nimco. I pray to God he comes soon. Did you mix the sugar? Yes, I have mixed it. Okay, go. Leave it. 
Give it to me. Go. Go. Get ready. 
I am going. I am going. You? Here? So, were you waiting 
for someone else? Why would I wait 
for someone else? Did you not get happy 
seeing me here? Why would I be happy? Really? By the way, the smile on your face is telling me 
that you are happy to see me here. There is nothing like that. You lie well, and you look equally good 
when you lie. Anyway, by the way, 
I know about one thing, if someone else would have come 
and stopped their car here like this, you would have scolded them badly. That is true. Okay, if you don’t mind, can we go and sit somewhere? No, it is really late. Hey, please. Please. For me. I will drop you back in a little while. Fine. Come on. Come on. Fehmida, my evening might 
suddenly get occupied, so I brought sister Kausar 
along in an emergency. And I thought, we are like family, you too will agree. And then, we shouldn’t delay 
the work of today, to tomorrow. Right? Yes, absolutely. You did well. Should I tell you the truth? I insisted a lot to Naseeban. She praised your daughter so much, that I couldn’t resist. If you didn’t like anything in my haste, 
then I apologize. Hey, no, not at all. What are you saying? You have the juice. Yes, yes, I will have that. But, call our daughter. 
We should also see her. Yes, why not? Go, bring Fiza. So, did you read the letter? Yes. And, then? Then, what? Then, how did you find it? or am I alone that 
I think like this, alone? I am here with you right now, and you still want to ask this? Yes, maybe I want to hear you express your love. I too want to know that do you too see my dreams 
with open eyes, the same way you have snatched 
the sleep of my night. You didn’t answer me. I don’t know. Okay. Okay, if you don’t know, then why did you not like it 
when I didn’t come to meet you? Actually, Rida and Fahad had a breakup, so I thought that…
What did you think? Hey, they broke up, not us. We have to feel each other’s love
right now. Do you always talk like this? No, before meeting you even I didn’t know
 that I could talk like this. But, that’s how it is. Anyway, shall we go somewhere for ice cream? Right now? It will get really late. I don’t want to get out of the car. Yes, so don’t get out of the car. We will sit and eat. Shall we go? Come on. I found her to be just as I had heard. Look. When Naseeban speaks, 
she speaks frankly. When she talks, 
she talks straight. Absolutely. 
There is no doubt about that. Sister, you just think that 
your daughter is now mine. You come and meet my son 
as soon as possible. Then we will fix the wedding date. But, so soon? Hey, Fehmida, our Fiza has a great destiny. See, the first relationship always 
comes from destined individuals. Rejecting the first relationship 
is like angering fate. Isn't that right? I will not hear a refusal, at all. That’s it. Your daughter has won my heart. That is fine, 
but I am not saying no. I will have to discuss 
this with Fiza’s father. Yes, yes, surely discuss. But just come and meet my son
in a day or two, so that we can take 
the discussion forward. Okay. By the way, what do you do? I stay busy with work at home 
and I teach in a school. Mama, show her brother’s picture. Hey, yes. I gave you the picture,
 show it to me. Yes, yes, I will just show it. Here. Have something, sister. Yes. Yes. Dua. Thank you. Shall we go? We are getting late. Yes, I will just drop you. No, you don’t drop me. If someone sees me, 
then it will be a big issue. Do one thing, drop me at 
the university stop, I will go myself. Okay, fine, we will do as you say. Okay? I brought this for you. This? Look at this, phone. I cannot take this. Hey, why can you take it? 
Don’t you love me? I love you, but… But, what? But, I cannot take this. What will I say at home? Hey, no one at home will find out. You don’t have to tell anyone, 
you have a phone. Keep it. Yes, but… But, what? Is there a problem 
taking it from me? Look, there was such 
an issue earlier too, when we couldn’t get in contact 
and even when we had met, we couldn’t talk. Keep it. Don’t you feel like talking to me? I want to. You want to, right? Keep it. I will keep it here. Now, we will talk to each other
whenever you want, and I have put a sim in this, 
so there is not a problem. Okay? And you know, after meeting today, I will want to talk even more. So, we will not be able to 
manage without them. Shall we go? Finish your ice cream first. We will be late. 
Hey, finish it. Come on, eat. 
Here. Eat it. We are going. 
Five minutes. Listen, you are coming now?
So, late. Yes, the bus broke down, 
so I changed two buses and came. Thank God Mama is in a good mood, or else you would have gotten 
scolded for being late. Okay, I will be thankful too, but tell me, why is she in a good mood? The boy’s family visited and went. They had to come in the evening, right? Yes, they had to come in the evening. Naseeban Bua had to go somewhere, so they brought them soon. What is this? 
I too wanted to see him. Who all came? 
How were they? They were good, 
decent people, and the mother and daughter came. They really liked our Fiza. Our Fiza is so pretty, 
anyone will like her. The boy is also really good. Where did you see him? His mother brought a picture. He is really handsome. We really liked him, 
and sister liked him too. Also show me. Sister Kausar took the picture along. Hey, I didn’t think about it 
that I would have kept it. I also had to show it to your papa. Anyway, when he goes 
he will see him, himself. So, you should have kept it for me. Okay, come on, tell me the name. Sarfaraz. The name is good. Are you happy? A lot. Where is this phone ringing? Huh? Where did a phone come from,
at our home? Dua, the sound is coming 
from your bag. Dua, I have told you a thousand times 
to keep the door closed. get up, get up. Strangers peek in here. Where the hell is everyone? Are you all drunk? No, go ahead. What do I have to say? 
Here, take it. Cook something good. How do you switch this off? Here. Water. Warm water. Hey, I have come from 
after walking in the sun. You couldn’t add a little syrup, 
add a little ice to it. Where are you going? To get the syrup. No need to bring the syrup. Hasn’t Dua come? Yes, she just came. Is this the time to come? Make her understand to come on time. She shouldn’t go around all the time. She should care for her father’s honor. Now get out of here. Mama. She’s not picking up the call? I couldn’t even think that you would take undue advantage 
of the leniency I have given you. Where did you get this phone from? Mama… Ask her. Ask her, where she got it from? Hey, if your father had seen it, all hell would have broken loose 
in this home by now. You two would have had 
to face harshness, my upbringing would have been 
questioned, only because of her. 
What are you doing? Leave her. Fine. Kill me. Kill me. Don’t leave me. I will also be spared. If you kill me, then at least the fire 
of this home will be cooled down. I too will get free from the home 
where you cannot even breathe. Questions are asked about it. Do you hear that? 
Do you see her argue? She is being stubborn 
after doing wrong. Mama, right now…
No. What wrong have I done? 
Tell me. What wrong have I done? No need to argue with Mama. Answer the question 
where did you get this phone from? Had Papa seen it, then you know hell would have 
broken loose. You know how much 
he hates these things. So, what if he hates it? When did I steal it or rob it? I don’t even know. 
When is this my phone? If it is not your phone, 
then where did you get it from? This is Rida’s phone. We are together all the time. In the class, in the canteen, she must have kept it 
by mistake in my bag, thinking it was her bag. How was I to know that I would get slapped so many times,
because of her mistake? Had I known, 
I would have kept it in a lock. Dua, you are really speaking the truth, right? No. I don’t… I don’t go to the university, I go to the stock exchange, where I earn millions, and I bought such an expensive phone. Rida told me yesterday that her father bought her a phone
 worth twenty-five thousand. The parents of people do 
so much for their children, they buy them phones,
they do everything, I am the one who is getting 
beaten here. It must be Rida’s phone. She must be calling from her brother’s 
number to ask where the phone is. This. Hello, Rida. Rida? Your phone came in my bag by mistake. I have kept it safe with me. When I come tomorrow 
take it from me, okay? Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine. Goodbye. I think her phone got caught. That’s it? Do you believe me? No, tell me, how else do I make 
you people believe? Whoever is your friend, return the phone to her 
in the morning and make her understand this well not to make this mistake again. Greetings sir. 
Greetings sir. Greetings. Sit. Yes, now tell us your problem. Yes, Rab Nawaz, tell me how the crop was this time. Sir, the crop turned out to be good. I get a good payment because 
of God’s blessing and your help, that I don’t have to go 
to the city and sell it. Okay, that’s a good thing. Yes, sir. It is because of you that prosperity
has come to this village. Hmmm. If there is any issue, 
then tell me. Sir, there is one issue. You know, I also started a milk 
and yogurt business last year. My cows died a few days back, I am worried because of that. And, it has also affected 
the business a lot. If you do me a favor and give me
a loan to buy two cows, I will return the money soon. Hmmm. Give Rab Nawaz money 
to buy two cows. Yes, sir. Sir, thank you. thank you very much. Okay, Rab Nawaz, one cow from 
this is a gift for you from us, pay off the loan for the other. That too only because you don’t 
get used to getting things for free. The earnings of self-respect are 
something else altogether. Yes? Yes, sir. You are absolutely right. Sir, I brought a small present for you, I will just bring it. Sir, I made this sweet yogurt for you
 with my own hands. You will not get the yogurt made
by Rab Nawaz anywhere in the city. Accept it, sir. Thank you. Ghulam Sarwar, you are insisting on meeting, sir. Come tell him, 
what is the issue? Greetings, sir. Sir, I have been waiting for you
for a long time, that when you will come, 
I will put my issue in front of you. I am amongst you, go ahead. Tell me, what is the issue? Sir, my daughter’s wedding 
is next month, and he… he says he won't let my daughter 
get married. Why? What issue do you have? Why won't you let it happen? How can Sahiba get married 
to someone else? I have loved her since childhood. Only your love doesn’t make a difference. It is necessary to know if the girl wants 
to marry you or not. She too loves me. They formed a relationship in good times, and Uncle Ghulam finished the relationship
when he found a good proposal. Sir, he is lying. My daughter agrees to that proposal. Don’t lie so much, Uncle Ghulam. Care for your age a little. For God’s sake. For God’s sake, 
leave my daughter alone. I will never leave her alone. I will see how you marry her 
to someone else with me there. I will make her disappear 
on the day of the wedding. Sir, did you see? 
Did you see? He threatens my daughter like this. He follows my daughter everywhere. Sir, her wedding is next month, if her in-laws find out, then her wedding will end 
before it happens. Then who will marry my daughter? No one will marry her. I will cut her husband into pieces. Sahiba is only mine. Uncle, marry her off to me with respect, or you will suffer the consequences. Talk with respect. This matter came to me. I will decide what decision 
needs to be made. Speak up, Ghulam Sarwar. 
What will you do? He has Sahiba locked up 
in the home for ten days. Don’t talk loudly. My people will go and ask that girl. If she wants to marry you, then I will get both of you married. She will never speak up, 
he has her threatened. He even raises his hand at her. He is not a father, 
he is a butcher. Don’t forget, he is the father of the girl 
you want to marry. He may be the father in his home. If he says something wrong to me, 
then I will not tolerate it. I told you to talk with respect. Hey, leave it. I don’t believe any court of yours. Who are you to decide 
about my marriage? I will do whatever happens. And uncle you too listen, 
your daughter will only marry me. If you even try, 
I will kidnap her and… How dare you? You are talking about kidnapping
a girl of my village. How dare you? What do you think?
I will leave you?
