[26.32] Have tea.
[29.64] Fiza,
[32.24] are you happy?
[35.80] Yes, I am happy.
[39.12] When will you make
me meet your husband?
[45.68] You want to meet Sarfaraz?
[48.96] Yes,
[50.88] he is my brother-in-law.
[52.64] You must have told him that
[55.44] I have returned, right?
[58.48] I don’t know how to tell him
[62.88] but the reality can't be hidden for long.
[65.36] What can I do?
[67.16] Tell me,
[68.80] what’s the matter?
[75.24] Sarafraz,
[81.16] he doesn't like your mention at all.
[89.68] Does he know that I am your sister?
[95.24] Yes,
[96.40] on our wedding day,
the matter was kept hidden,
[101.60] and everything was fine.
[104.20] But the next day, the secret came out,
[106.40] and ever since then,
[108.64] his mood hasn't improved.
[112.24] He gets irritated by your name.
[118.04] Why?
[120.20] I haven't even met him
[123.52] so what problem does he have with me?
[126.20] In his eyes,
[128.12] girls who run away from
home cannot be forgiven,
[133.04] and you,
[135.00] Dua, have committed this crime.
[141.20] I haven't even told him about your return
[145.80] because I'm afraid that
[148.04] if he finds out,
[150.52] he might force me to
cut ties with this house.
[157.64] From now on Fiza, not you
[160.32] but Sarfaraz will be scared.
[200.00] Why are you standing
outside of this house?
[201.56] Our madam comes here.
[204.16] Why does your madam come here?
[205.64] This is our madam’s home.
[221.92] You?
[234.72] Yes, it’s me.
[236.60] Why?
[238.00] Can't you believe it?
[245.04] How will you believe?
[247.68] How could you, after leaving me to suffer
as if I were doomed to burn in hell?
[258.68] I recently learned that
[262.24] you're my brother-in-law,
[267.60] and honestly,
[269.32] I didn’t like it at all.
[273.16] How can the husband of my beloved
sister be such a characterless person?
[283.32] To be honest,
[284.88] I wanted to forget everything you did to me.
[291.92] I hoped to leave it all to God and move on.
[296.44] But not anymore.
[301.44] My resolve is weakening now
[304.56] that I know you are Fiza’s husband.
[310.80] I might have forgiven you for
the sake of my sister before,
[315.60] but that’s no longer possible.
[320.20] I will hold you accountable for
the pain my sister endured.
[329.64] You’ve tainted my honor
[332.76] and disrespected Fiza under
the guise of being her husband.
[340.24] Her crime is indeed very big
since she married a man like you.
[349.56] You have played enough
with the respect of everyone.
[353.36] Now, your game is over.
[356.80] Now, I will tell you
[358.60] what it feels like to get
your respect tarnished.
[365.00] Now, you will face
the same pain I endured
[376.80] or the pain you caused Fiza.
[385.32] Now, I dare you to bring a tear to Fiza’s eyes.
[388.80] If I don’t turn you to dust then tell me.
[395.84] Yesterday, you sought to make
the helpless Dua the center of attention.
[405.80] Today, you face a different Dua,
[410.96] someone you cannot harm or escape from.
[423.64] Now, just wait and watch
[425.56] what I will do to you.
[492.60] Maybe you are upset because
it took me time to come out.
[496.28] Actually, I couldn’t find my robe,
[498.88] which is why, I got late.
[523.64] Why did I go quiet in front of her?
[526.52] Why wasn’t I able to say anything to her?
[530.20] Who is she to threaten me?
[544.08] Where did she get all this wealth from?
[547.64] I left her in a place where
she couldn't escape from
[552.28] then how did she manage
to get all this wealth?
[568.20] If I tell everyone the truth then
she won't be able to face the world
[573.12] but how will I tell everyone 
that I was that person?
[583.00] Such a luxurious car 
came to drop your family off,
[585.92] what's going on?
[587.08] You have such rich relatives
[588.64] and I don’t know about them, hmm?
[590.56] They are our distant relatives,
[592.44] from my father’s side.
[597.16] They come seldomly.
[598.92] No, no,
[600.96] the matter is definitely something else.
[603.68] This is the truth.
[610.24] Today, you face a different Dua,
[613.24] someone you cannot harm or escape from.
[618.20] Now, just wait and watch
[619.48] what I will do to you.
[626.92] What is the issue with you?
[629.16] Is the issue with me or your brother?
[630.88] What did Brother do this time?
[632.48] He didn't even talk to you.
[634.48] Your brother has an attitude problem.
[636.84] Why is he so arrogant?
[638.60] You are harboring resentment
towards Brother for no reason.
[641.92] He is jealous of me.
[644.12] I agree that my brother is short-tempered
[645.64] but that does not mean that
[646.64] you keep on badmouthing Brother
and praising Sister-in-law.
[649.76] I only speak the truth.
[651.92] You shouldn’t speak enough truth
that cannot be digested.
[654.40] Sister-in-law Fiza is very nice.
[656.72] Even a blind person can tell that.
[658.52] What do you know about
Sister-in-law and her background?
[663.68] What don't I know? Enlighten me.
[665.72] Sister-in-law and her sister,
[667.48] they don’t belong to an honourable family.
[671.68] Our patience
[672.96] and Brother’s nobility
[674.12] have allowed him to remain married to her.
[679.56] And then, there is you,
[680.64] who keeps taunting me about how
my brother is this way or that way.
[687.76] So you proved that
[689.88] you are indeed the sister of your brother.
[692.52] You are the same blood.
[694.36] Yes, I am. We are the same blood.
[696.68] At least we are not two-faced.
[701.32] Unlike Sister-in-law, our news doesn’t get
broadcast on TV or appear in the newspaper.
[707.84] Do you know what Sumbul,
[710.20] I think we should not
talk for a few days.
[714.40] Yes,
[715.44] even I believe that
we shouldn't talk for a few days.
[751.16] Sumbul, please check the salt in this.
[753.36] Please check it yourself.
[755.08] Hey, what happened? Is your mood off?
[761.56] Did you argue with Khizar?
[763.64] Yes, we argued.
[766.08] You are the reason for our argument.
[769.24] Me?
[770.92] How did I become the reason?
[774.52] You are very clever.
[776.48] You are very clever.
[781.72] You present Brother as
a tyrant in front of the world
[784.40] and everyone believes
that Brother oppresses you.
[788.52] I have never complained
about Sarfaraz to anyone.
[792.44] You might not have complained
[793.68] but you make an innocent face
[795.96] that you garner everyone’s sympathy.
[800.20] You have a misunderstanding
regarding me Sumbul.
[803.00] No.
[804.72] The blindfold of misunderstanding
has been removed from my eyes.
[812.40] You are not as good as
I considered you to be.
[820.44] When Khizar compares me to you,
[824.08] then I realize that
[826.28] Mother and Brother are absolutely right.
[828.40] Girls like you can never
see someone get settled.
[832.12] What are you talking about Sumbul?
[834.60] Just do me a favour.
[836.60] Stay away from Khizar.
[838.28] Please.
[841.96] Are you saying this Sumbul?
[843.56] Yes,
[845.28] first Brother used to say this
and now I am saying it.
[852.60] If my relationship gets ruined because of you
[857.56] then it won’t be good for you.
[863.00] Remember that.
[883.04] With the ominous face you
roam around in front of me,
[886.08] it turns into a smiling face as soon as
a stranger man comes in front of you.
[891.56] People believe that
I oppress you but, in reality,
[894.92] women like you stay happy
with a stranger man.
[899.52] You are doing wrong.
[901.72] Khizar is like my brother.
[903.00] That’s enough!
[904.44] He is like my brother.
[937.36] Jaffar, do you see this guy?
[941.28] Go after him and find out where he works.
[944.84] Where does he go?
[946.32] I want all the details of him.
[949.20] Sure.
[950.24] Listen,
[953.36] don’t mention all this to Ghaznavi.
[958.00] He is my brother-in-law so
[960.12] I don't want him to find out
anything regarding this matter.
[963.20] You don’t worry at all.
[965.92] It will be like that.
[999.56] Madam, that guy is Sarfaraz.
[1002.36] He works in sir’s office.
[1004.84] In Ghaznavi’s office?
[1007.76] Does that mean he has met Ghaznavi?
[1011.56] Yes, he is very ill-mannered.
[1013.72] Sir even wanted to kick him out of the office.
[1019.64] Okay.
[1055.76] What’s this?
Why are you picking up your veil?
[1057.92] Mom, I’m just leaving.
[1059.16] I’m about to head out.
[1060.36] Leaving like this?
[1061.40] Have something to eat.
[1062.20] No, Mom, you know I’ll be late.
I’m leaving now.
[1064.44] There’s no rush.
[1066.00] Have a little food.
[1067.00] I’ll feed my daughter with my own hands.
[1068.84] Sit down here.
[1071.24] Okay, then call Saniya too.
[1073.76] She’ll come. She’s making fritters.
[1080.08] These were ready so I brought them,
[1081.52] since you’re in a hurry.
[1086.96] What happened, Fiza?
[1088.20] Fiza.
[1091.48] Fiza.
[1092.80] Fiza, Fiza my child, what’s...
[1116.72] Fiza , its ok?
[1118.84] What happened? Are you feeling unwell?
[1121.24] Come, let’s go to the doctor.
[1122.28] No, Mom, I just want to go home.
I need to go home.
[1124.32] You can go home from there too.
[1126.12] Let’s go to the doctor.
[1127.72] Put on your veil, I’ll get mine.
[1130.12] Let’s go.
[1143.72] Many Congratulations,
[1145.16] you’re going to be a grandmother.
[1146.96] But since she’s had a miscarriage before,
[1150.16] we’ll need to be very careful this time.
[1152.48] She’ll need to follow a proper diet,
[1154.12] and I’m recommending some iron
and calcium medicine
[1157.60] that she’ll need to take regularly.
[1159.56] Yes, of course.
[1160.88] You can get all these medicines
from our pharmacy.
[1164.68] Here you go.
[1166.08] Thank you so much.
[1182.24] Thank you.
[1184.68] Thank you very much. Goodbye.
[1244.20] You?
[1246.60] Yes, me.
[1250.04] What are you doing here?
[1253.32] Came to see you.
[1255.88] Why are you standing? Sit down.
[1257.92] Shut up and get out of here.
[1265.28] I have a reputation at this place.
[1268.32] Don’t say anything ridiculous here.
[1271.00] Reputation?
[1278.64] The other day you threatened
me to tell everyone everything.
[1291.24] Go ahead and tell them,
[1293.64] or should I do it?
[1296.36] Keep your mouth shut,
do you understand?
[1303.72] I’ll make sure you and
your sister are so disgraced
[1306.12] you won’t be able to show
your faces anywhere.
[1309.04] You’re still threatening me?
[1313.28] Amazing.
[1315.20] I’m not threatening you.
[1317.68] I’m just telling you what
I’m going to do to you.
[1325.36] And that rich man you married,
[1327.44] by trapping and deceiving him,
[1332.40] I’ll tell him everything.
[1334.92] You won’t have anywhere to go.
[1337.96] Not all men are like you,
[1341.84] with a dirty mind like yours.
[1344.16] Hmm.
[1345.72] Oh,
[1347.28] it seems you haven’t forgotten
what happened to you.
[1352.48] I haven’t forgotten anything,
[1358.24] and I won’t let you forget either.
[1361.88] Fine, then let’s go.
[1364.92] If I want, I can expose
the truth to everyone.
[1368.84] Go ahead, reveal the truth to everyone.
[1374.52] I’d like to see how brave you really are.
[1384.52] And the thing you’re
trying to scare me with,
[1389.36] Ghaznavi already knows everything.
[1398.92] But think about what will happen to you
if I tell him that person is you.
[1405.44] What will he do to you?
[1410.96] Ghaznavi?
[1413.32] You’re standing in front of
Mrs. Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[1424.44] What?
[1436.48] You were coming to the office?
Why didn’t you tell me?
[1438.92] Surprise.
[1445.36] Oh.
[1449.08] What brings you here?
[1452.12] Came to see Sarfaraz.
[1457.20] I don’t understand.
[1459.72] He’s my brother-in-law,
[1461.56] Fiza’s husband.
[1466.12] Fiza’s husband?
[1468.60] I just found out yesterday
that he works here,
[1473.92] so I thought if I am coming,
I’d meet him.
[1478.00] He doesn’t like meeting us, you know.
[1488.16] Let’s go to my room.
[1489.04] Not to the room.
[1491.80] I didn’t come here to sit,
I came to have lunch.
[1494.96] Let’s go for lunch then.
[1496.96] Let’s go.
[1498.00] Phone.
[1536.52] Here you go.
[1542.28] The blood report will come tomorrow.
[1544.52] You heard what the doctor said, right?
[1546.80] You have to take care of your diet
[1548.28] and take your medicine on time.
[1549.84] Yes,
[1551.12] it’s getting late. I’ll leave for home now.
[1554.28] Yes, let’s go after getting the medicine.
[1556.20] Actually, I’ll personally drop you home,
[1559.00] and I’ll tell Sister Kausar that
[1561.44] you won’t be working
at the school anymore.
[1563.48] No, Mom, she won’t like that.
[1567.88] My child, you’ve already suffered once.
[1570.44] You need to take care of yourself.
[1573.04] I’ll take care of myself,
[1575.20] I’ll try to talk to her when
I get the chance to quit the job.
[1581.88] If you say something,
she might not like it.
[1585.36] Just drop me home from outside.
[1588.40] -Alright,
-Take medicine
[1589.76] as you wish. Give me that, son.
[1624.76] I’ll tell Sarfaraz first,
[1628.20] then he’ll inform everyone at home.
[1631.80] He’ll be very happy with this news.
[1634.20] Yes.
[1636.44] Maybe,
[1637.92] just maybe, this news will
change his attitude towards me.
[1641.20] Maybe this news will make him love me.
[1648.48] When will he come?
[1649.80] Look, I know
[1651.80] I’ve caused you a lot of pain,
[1653.80] and I deeply regret it.
[1659.12] Your regret won’t fill my empty arms.
[1664.88] My child left this world before
I could even hold him.
[1678.24] Fiza, but don’t worry,
[1681.28] I’m here with you.
[1683.92] God will bless us with more children,
[1687.68] and I promise you this time
[1691.12] I’ll take very good care of you.
[1701.52] Greetings.
[1706.32] I’ve laid out your clothes.
[1715.28] Listen, there’s something
I want to tell you.
[1725.40] I wanted to say something to you.
[1727.68] Can’t you understand that
I don’t want to talk to you?
[1732.72] Did I make a mistake?
[1734.44] No,
[1735.96] you didn’t make a mistake.
[1737.12] The mistake was mine for marrying you,
[1739.12] and for that,
[1740.08] I beg your forgiveness. Here, take it.
[1742.24] Why are you doing this?
[1743.56] What are you saying?
[1745.12] I just wanted to tell you that...
[1747.32] Fiza, stop bothering me,
[1749.84] please stop bothering me.
[1776.08] You are his wife.
[1777.00] If you don’t know, then who does?
[1778.76] Does your husband love you or not?
[1782.40] Sarfaraz’s anger takes over everything.
[1786.24] I can’t figure out if he loves me or not.
[1789.00] Parents can only judge the decency of a boy’s
family before getting their daughters married.
[1799.36] A mother cannot see
[1802.84] if her daughter will receive love
from that family or not.
[1827.00] By the way, I was really surprised.
[1830.32] About what?
[1832.56] To find out that Sarfaraz is Fiza’s husband.
[1838.08] Hmm,
[1840.48] I was surprised too.
[1848.44] I mean,
[1849.68] I didn’t expect Sarfaraz for Fiza.
[1853.56] Exactly, he doesn’t suit Fiza at all.
[1862.64] I mean, he’s a very different guy,
who says strange things.
[1868.20] I also found him strange
after hearing his words.
[1875.04] What did your father and
mother see in him?
[1880.48] Respectability.
[1883.16] That’s what middle-class parents look for.
[1886.16] But there’s nothing else there.
[1891.36] Wasn’t it Sarfaraz who
said he objected to meeting you?
[1901.08] Where did that objection go?
[1908.00] He’s still my employee.
[1914.48] I thought after learning the truth,
he’d quit this job,
[1919.64] but that didn’t happen.
[1923.00] We’ll see.
[1928.00] What happened? Did he say something?
[1930.56] Did he misbehave?
[1934.32] No, no,
[1942.08] what would he say to me?
[1945.12] He was speechless
when he saw me as your wife.
[1950.64] I didn’t like him much either.
[1956.68] You should keep your distance from him.
[1965.12] It’s fine to meet him as Fiza’s husband
[1968.04] but within limits.
[1976.08] That’s why I’m saying if
he says something to you tomorrow,
[1978.72] I won’t tolerate it.
[1980.64] Then I’ll deal with him in my own way.
[1986.48] So, you should be careful.
[1990.80] Yes.
