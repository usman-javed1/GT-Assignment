[23.10] You didn’t come to
 the school today
[24.70] so I got worried for you
 and came here.
[26.50] You took an off,
 is everything okay?
[29.23] I just don’t feel like coming
 to the school now.
[33.10] Sania?
[34.33] You don’t feel like coming,
[35.50] what does that mean?
[36.90] Hmm?
[38.47] Mom,
[39.90] did Dad say something again?
[44.07] Why aren’t you saying something?
[45.17] What happened, Mom?
[46.77] What will Mom say?
[48.83] She is very worried herself.
[50.73] Worried, but why?
[52.87] The boy’s family is coming to
 see me in the evening.
[55.50] Dad wants to get me married 
as soon as possible.
[58.90] What?
[60.50] Your marriage?
[62.30] Mom,
[63.30] she is so young right now.
[65.83] Hey?
[66.67] What should I do, my child?
[68.57] I tried very hard to make 
your Dad understand,
[73.17] but he is not ready to listen.
[75.07] That’s a very cruel act, Mom.
[77.33] Our Sania is fond of studying,
[79.73] let her study right now.
[81.53] I, I will talk to him,
[82.70] I will make Dad understand,
[84.23] don’t worry, Sania.
[85.93] Okay,
[88.93] so now you have 
grown up so much
[91.83] that you will make your 
father understand?
[93.47] Yeah?
[94.80] Dad,
[96.30] Sania is very young right now,
[98.33] why do you want to 
get her married?
[100.07] I shouldn’t get her married
[101.23] and wait for her to run away?
[102.57] What should I do?
[103.30] Tell me.
[104.30] Dad, but
[105.50] my sisters aren’t like that.
[106.70] Explain this to your in-laws,
[108.97] not me.
[109.90] Wouldn’t it be better if you stop caring 
about people and think about your family?
[115.93] People keep on talking, Dad.
[117.53] I am watching it,
[118.90] the daughter who won’t even talk 
in front of me until yesterday,
[121.53] is barking in front
 of her father today.
[124.00] I have to speak up, Dad,
[125.93] no matter if it is about
 the people of this house
[126.97] or that house,
[127.47] they are both my family.
[128.60] No one is your family,
[129.77] this house is not yours now,
[131.13] you are married now,
[132.53] you must stay where 
you got married.
[134.67] We are here to take care 
of the matters of this house.
[136.93] Okay, I won’t come,
[137.67] but you cannot do
 this injustice with Sania, Dad.
[140.10] Who?
[142.17] Who will stop me?
[143.10] Yeah?
[145.37] Get out of this house
[147.17] and never come back again.
[148.70] What is wrong with you?
[150.23] How are you talking 
to your daughter?
[152.37] Hey, is this my daughter?
[153.63] She forgot all the respect
 of her father in two days.
[156.43] No, Dad,
[158.07] I haven't forgotten anything
[160.27] but I am just asking you
[162.73] to not marry Sania off right now,
[165.30] that’s unjust.
[166.53] I will do it.
[167.93] Hey, I am trying to get rid of 
you girls as soon as possible.
[170.87] If you want to get rid of us, then
[172.73] close the doors of this house 
on us like you did for Dua
[175.93] and get rid of us.
[177.43] Now,
[178.47] now, you will tell me
[180.07] what I have to do?
[181.63] You cannot do this injustice,
[183.43] this is wrong with Sania.
[184.87] Mrs. Fehmida,
[186.50] do you see this?
[188.33] This is how you have 
raised your daughters.
[190.77] She has been constantly
 barking in front of her father.
[193.63] Why are you 
blaming Mom, Dad?
[195.83] Are we not your daughters?
[197.40] No,
[198.10] you are not my
 daughter. Get out!
[199.23] Get out of here. Get out!
[201.17] What are you doing?
[201.87] Why are you pushing 
the poor girl?
[203.20] I have gotten you married,
[205.00] you just don’t have any 
right over this house now.
[206.83] You are dead to me.
[210.93] Dad is doing very 
wrong with Sania.
[214.63] Only what Dad wants will happen,
[216.90] you guys don’t speak in my favor,
[220.90] I cannot see you guys 
getting humiliated anymore.
[234.03] I shall leave now, Mom,
[236.57] you look after Sania,
[240.07] she is worried.
[254.70] Bye.
[290.80] I need the contact number of
 the woman Dua used to live with.
[295.53] Yes, right now.
[303.77] I kept on squirming for
 a glance and you,
[307.90] you became his choice?
[321.00] You have robbed my right,
[324.43] I will make your life miserable.
[335.53] Mom,
[336.70] I gave you such big news today
[338.93] and you are feeding 
me this grass?
[341.27] Feed me some Qorma 
or Nihari today.
[345.10] Sumbul has gone to college
[347.17] and your wife hasn’t even 
come back from school yet,
[351.27] so how will the stove light up
[352.47] and how will the
 food get cooked?
[353.50] Tell me.
[354.33] She will come, she will come,
[355.50] here she is.
[357.33] Where were you, queen?
[359.60] You do know that you have
 to cook the food, right?
[362.60] Hey,
[364.17] what happened to her?
[365.83] Why did she ignore me like this?
[368.77] I don’t know,
[369.60] I think she is out of her mind.
[372.43] I think she got the 
heat from outside.
[374.53] But why didn’t 
she respond to me?
[377.17] To hell with her.
[379.10] Look, we just have to 
celebrate today,
[381.80] because I have to join
 from tomorrow.
[384.00] I will definitely celebrate
[385.63] but first of all I will fix her mind!
[389.00] Why didn’t she give
 me a response?
[390.70] How did she ignore 
me and leave?
[394.07] No one is your family,
[395.43] this house is not yours now,
[397.07] you are married now,
[398.73] you must stay where
 you got married.
[401.07] We are here to take care 
of the matters of this house.
[406.97] Get out of this house
[408.90] and never come back again.
[410.37] What is wrong with you?
[412.07] How are you talking
 to your daughter?
[414.17] Hey, is this my daughter?
[415.47] She forgot all the respect 
of her father in two days.
[420.37] This is how you have raised 
your daughters.
[422.80] She has been constantly 
barking in front of her father.
[425.73] No,
[426.30] you are not my daughter. Get out!
[427.67] Get out of here. Get out!
[436.67] Who died?
[438.90] For whom you are creating 
misfortune in our house?
[441.50] No, I…
[443.23] you had some work from me?
[445.43] There was a lot of work,
[446.93] but Madam is showing 
so much attitude,
[449.30] and came inside without 
even listening to me.
[451.37] No, I was just, I was just taking 
this veil off and coming.
[457.27] Coming from where?
[459.27] You are mourning here.
[462.30] Is everything okay?
[464.10] Where did you go using 
school as an excuse?
[466.50] Who did you meet that 
you can’t stop crying?
[469.90] Mom, Mom is not well
[472.13] so I just thought of her 
and it made me cry.
[474.97] Hey?
[476.40] Everybody gets unwell
[478.93] but so much crying and whining 
because of your mother being unwell,
[482.77] it doesn’t make any sense,
[484.83] there is definitely something.
[486.83] No, there is nothing.
[490.07] There is something
[492.37] but if you want to hide it,
[494.73] it’s different.
[496.77] No, do you know,
[498.07] it’s not that,
[500.70] it’s just that Mom
 is not well and then
[505.00] the topic of Sania’s
 marriage was raised,
[506.97] when I thought of it, 
it made me cry.
[509.33] What?
[511.13] Another daughter’s marriage?
[513.33] Wow, wow,
[514.97] your parents are commendable.
[517.57] The first daughter ran 
away from the house,
[518.97] they imposed the second
 daughter on our head
[520.50] and now they are also 
concerned for their third daughter.
[522.27] Wow,
[523.40] they are extremely clever people.
[525.93] They know very well how to
 impose their headache on others.
[530.43] And by the way,
[531.77] when you marry your daughter,
[533.73] you are supposed to teach 
them some manners of living with the in-laws,
[536.50] now look at yourself,
[538.50] it’s almost sunset,
[540.77] and the food hasn’t
 been cooked yet,
[542.83] you came late from school
[544.07] and now you are sitting here
[545.03] and crying for you parents and family,
[547.60] do you want to make 
a home with your in-laws or not?
[550.27] Yes, yes,
[551.47] I, I am coming to do the work.
[554.00] You have to come within a minute,
[557.67] otherwise, you know Sarfaraz,
[559.80] he cannot resist hunger,
[561.30] so don’t say anything to me,
[562.90] control him yourself then,
[564.53] do you understand or not?
[566.83] By the way, my son
 is absolutely right
[569.83] when he says that God knows 
what family we got him into.
[574.90] My son had a lot of 
proposals, madam,
[578.97] understand?
[581.07] Come quickly.
[633.17] Hello?
[635.00] How are you, Miss Zunaira?
[637.27] I am absolutely fine.
[638.40] I am sorry I didn’t recognize you.
[641.30] You just recognize 
the bag full of money
[644.57] that I am about to give you.
[648.43] And that bag full of money,
[651.20] why would you give it to me?
[652.67] I will pay you the price of 
the work you will do for me.
[660.03] What work?
[661.43] To take Dua out of 
Nosherwan’s life.
[667.07] And why do you think 
I will do this for you?
[672.77] Money has a lot of power, 
Miss Zunaira.
[675.93] And by the way,
[676.57] I have heard that
[677.13] you are really fond of sleeping 
on a bed full of money.
[680.87] You have heard it right
[683.97] but
[686.37] I have taken a hefty amount from
 Mr. Ghaznavi to send Dua from here.
[693.37] So,
[694.73] so that’s even better.
[697.53] Dua is working for 
you as a bird of Gold,
[700.87] you should be happy to 
hear about my offer.
[703.13] What do you mean?
[704.23] I didn’t get it.
[706.93] You just do the task of taking out 
Dua from Nosherwan’s life,
[711.03] and I will pay you for it
[714.17] and then where will Dua go
 after getting out of here?
[717.07] She will come to you only,
[719.30] so then you get paid for her 
from whomever you want,
[722.03] however you want and 
wherever you want.
[726.10] Oh, I see.
[729.13] It looks like you got my point.
[731.63] Okay,
[732.77] so when should I send 
the bag full of money?
[734.93] Send it but,
[736.90] before that introduce yourself.
[740.27] That is not needed,
[742.67] you just be concerned 
about the money,
[744.93] there is a lot of time to be known.
[748.90] Okay. Send it.
[752.20] Okay.
[758.43] After all, what’s in that girl
[761.03] that everybody is ready to pay 
such a hefty amount for her?
[770.47] You will have to go back 
to the same dirt, Dua,
[776.27] that is your actual home.
[793.57] It was very pleasant meeting you,
[795.90] like they say,
[796.50] you should meet the girl’s mother 
before meeting the girl,
[799.40] so we chose Sania 
without even meeting her.
[802.33] Just show us a glimpse of her.
[805.03] She must be here anytime now.
[809.33] Umm,
[810.53] tell me what does
 your brother do?
[813.10] We have a very well-established 
business of shoes,
[817.73] we are honest people like you,
[819.77] we don’t make relationships
 based on lies.
[821.77] The situation of our business 
is not very good these days,
[825.13] Mumtaz’s first wife
[827.30] was very generous 
with spending money,
[828.67] she was very fond
 of spending money,
[830.63] she ran away with a man younger
 than herself just for the greed of money,
[834.67] leaving 2 children behind,
[836.00] But Sania will have to look
 after everything after marriage.
[839.77] What?
[841.60] Mumtaz is already married?
[843.43] Yes, brother Aslam knows the elder 
brother of Mumtaz, Asghar, very well.
[847.33] He also attended Mumtaz’s 
wedding a few years back,
[850.43] didn’t he tell you?
[855.20] Greetings.
[856.10] Are you Sania?
[866.53] What happened, Mom?
[868.17] Is everything okay?
[870.10] Go to my room and
 sit there quietly.
[872.07] And don’t come out.
[874.23] Go.
[875.13] Okay, fine.
[882.20] We have a lot of respect, 
I will tell you,
[884.30] but relatives sometimes say things…
[887.57] Mr. Aslam, listen to me
[891.53] I will be right back.
[897.70] What is this behavior?
[899.60] Who is the boy out of them?
[902.33] The one in the white 
Salwar Suit is the one.
[905.47] Ask them to get out 
of here right now.
[908.43] Hunh?
[909.37] I don’t want to marry 
my daughter to them.
[911.87] What are you saying?
[913.10] Ask them to leave.
[914.33] Hunh?
[957.67] You look very beautiful.
[965.60] Sometimes I don’t
 believe in my fate
[971.93] that you have become mine.
[974.77] What is the reason
 for not believing?
[978.80] When you went missing,
[982.33] I thought I won’t ever find you,
[988.10] but look,
[989.57] the fate made me find you.
[994.70] I guess I will gradually 
believe on my fate.
[998.90] So then believe it,
[1003.67] I am yours.
[1005.83] There is no doubt about that now.
[1012.87] You didn’t tell me,
[1014.20] where are we going?
[1016.57] Yes,
[1017.53] I thought you might be
 getting bored at home so
[1021.27] let’s go out for
 dinner somewhere.
[1024.93] Okay.
[1027.77] No, if you have other
 plans then tell me,
[1029.37] we will go there first.
[1033.00] No, no,
[1034.57] this is fine too.
[1037.97] It’s enough.
[1044.03] Okay, I am waiting
 for you outside.
[1047.73] Hello?
[1091.50] What is this scene that
 you have created?
[1093.77] You made everyone leave.
[1095.60] You didn’t even let me talk.
[1097.50] It’s good that they left respectfully.
[1100.10] What do you mean by all this?
[1101.70] I have no complaints from them,
[1102.90] but you, Mr Aslam,
[1104.50] you are Sania’s biological father,
[1106.40] you have brought such
 a mis-match for her.
[1108.37] So, what’s the flaw in this one?
[1110.03] He is just a bit old in
 age, what else?
[1111.87] And who looks at the
 age of a man who earns?
[1115.27] He is just old in age.
[1116.93] I had an objection 
that he is old in age
[1119.93] but that bastard is 
a father of children,
[1121.93] he is married,
[1123.03] he has children
 as old as my Sania,
[1125.67] and it is not a big deal for you?
[1128.27] What kind of a father are you?
[1129.60] He doesn’t have a wife,
[1131.37] and his children are sensible,
[1132.23] our Sania doesn’t 
have to raise them.
[1134.30] How are you 
defending this match?
[1138.63] What do you see in it?
[1140.20] A dumb woman like
 you will never understand.
[1143.03] He is a businessman,
[1144.50] he has a lot of money.
[1145.83] Our Sania will live 
a luxurious life.
[1147.17] I don’t want to get her
 married in such places.
[1149.17] Don’t find and bring
 such proposals.
[1151.33] Who are you to stop me?
[1153.53] I am her father
[1154.80] and I have decided to get 
Sania married as soon as possible.
[1158.97] I won’t sacrifice my daughter
 for your blind decisions.
[1162.83] It will be better if you don’t bring 
such proposals next time.
[1166.10] You,
[1167.33] you will stop me?
[1168.33] Yes, I will stop you.
[1169.63] You closed the doors of our
 home on one daughter,
[1172.87] I won’t let you close the doors 
of fate on our other daughter.
[1176.57] Look, Mrs Fehmida,
[1178.57] you are crossing all the limits by 
going against my decision.
[1182.20] I will cross the limits,
[1183.77] I will cross the limits!
[1185.53] What will you do?
[1186.80] Tell me.
[1188.37] You have already threatened 
me about divorce,
[1190.50] you can divorce me if you want to
[1193.20] but I will go to any limit for 
the happiness of my daughter,
[1197.07] do you understand?
[1211.93] I won’t let anything wrong
 happen to my daughter.
[1243.27] Hello?
[1244.23] How are you, Dua?
[1247.43] Who is it?
[1248.03] Hey,
[1249.27] I never expected this from you
[1252.80] that you would forget me so soon,
[1256.20] and that too, me, Zunaira.
[1262.97] I haven't forgotten you
[1265.30] but I don’t even want
 to remember you.
[1268.70] Why have you called me?
[1270.10] Your style has changed.
[1273.57] Anyway,
[1275.03] why wouldn’t it change?
[1277.67] It is not something ordinary
 to be Ghaznavi’s choice.
[1284.00] How did you get my number?
[1286.27] You have hurt me by asking 
such a small question.
[1292.80] What do you think,
[1295.37] can I be that unaware about you?
[1298.47] Tell me if there is something
 important to say,
[1299.70] otherwise, I am hanging up.
[1301.10] We will comfortably talk 
tomorrow if you are in a rush.
[1305.87] I don’t want to talk to
 you about anything,
[1307.80] not today, not tomorrow, never!
[1310.27] Why so rude, Dua?
[1314.30] Did you forget it so soon,
[1316.97] how I saved you from the goons
 the other dark night?
[1325.00] How can I forget
[1328.43] how you saved me 
from those wolves
[1330.23] and tried pushing
 me in that marsh?
[1334.17] But you didn’t succeed then.
[1336.43] It looks like you aren’t out of the 
intoxication of Ghaznavi’s love yet,
[1342.23] otherwise you 
wouldn’t be talking big,
[1344.77] that too in front of me.
[1346.77] Intoxication is the word for honor 
and love for people like you.
[1353.73] Don’t ever call me again.
[1356.03] I am hanging up.
[1357.17] Do me a favor,
[1359.40] I won’t bother you after that.
[1365.97] What favor?
[1366.93] Mr. Sarkar called,
[1370.57] he was saying he wanted
 to meet that girl,
[1376.30] he is adamant.
[1380.40] You wounded him and made
 my life miserable.
[1385.47] It is about his ego now.
[1387.23] Are you in your senses?
[1389.10] What are you saying?
[1390.30] I am saying it for your own good.
[1392.17] He has found out 
where you got married,
[1395.70] imagine,
[1397.33] if the word gets to Ghaznavi,
[1399.93] what will happen then?
[1401.33] What if he finds out
[1404.23] what you did to Mr. Sarkar,
[1409.70] he is a man,
[1412.57] who will make him believe 
you are still a pure girl.
[1421.70] I am afraid that
[1423.73] you might fall out of his 
heart when he finds out.
[1427.33] Stop your nonsense
[1430.03] How dare you talk 
to me about this?
[1432.57] Please, Dua,
[1434.63] don’t be angry.
[1436.60] Help me.
[1438.03] You have taken more charity 
than you deserve, in my name.
[1443.73] And it will be better now
[1445.43] if you forget me and my name.
[1448.67] How, Dua?
[1450.87] At least think.
[1452.90] Okay listen,
[1454.77] I will also pay you.
[1456.47] I spit on you
[1459.30] and your forbidden money.
[1464.20] Uh!
[1468.60] She hung up.
[1471.00] Anyway,
[1472.07] that’s enough for today.
[1481.90] Shall we leave if you are ready?
[1497.13] What is it? What are you thinking?
[1498.47] Nothing.
[1500.37] I said, shall we leave?
[1504.23] Let’s go.
[1507.27] Your phone.
[1520.90] Fiza,
[1522.73] give sweets to your Dad.
[1529.17] Fiza?
[1531.17] Where is this girl lost?
[1534.23] Yes, what were you saying?
[1535.87] I am asking you to give
 sweets to your Dad,
[1539.30] your husband got a job.
[1541.27] Yes, yes,
[1542.33] uncle, have it.
[1544.50] Thank you, my child.
[1549.13] I don’t know where is this girl lost.
[1551.97] Her husband has got 
such a nice job,
[1553.97] that’s such a happy thing
[1555.03] but she doesn’t seem happy.
[1557.50] No, no, I am very happy,
[1559.77] in fact, I prayed a lot for his job.
[1562.53] Hey, what prayers?
[1564.30] I am the one who prayed.
[1566.07] I have woken up for Tahajjud
 and prayed for him,
[1568.70] that may God give 
a good job to my son,
[1571.60] and look,
[1572.40] God gave him a job,
[1574.20] and she wanted to take all 
the credit for the prayers herself.
[1577.50] Listen?
[1579.03] We are grateful to God that 
everyone’s prayers got answered,
[1582.23] it is time to offer
 thanking prayers now,
[1584.30] hmm?
[1586.97] And son,
[1589.07] you must work hard too.
[1590.97] Yes.
[1591.90] Fiza, give me water.
[1594.43] Okay.
[1596.53] I will go get it.
[1598.00] Umm, sister-in-law,
[1599.00] you sit, I will bring it.
[1600.23] Umm, no, no,
[1601.20] you continue eating,
[1601.83] I am done eating, so I will bring it.
[1610.97] What happened? 
Sister-in-law?
[1612.33] What happened, sister-in-law?
[1614.50] Umm, I just got dizzy.
[1617.23] My child, if you are not well,
[1619.87] Sarfaraz will take you to the doctor.
[1621.77] Where will you find
 the doctor at this time?
[1623.57] There must be some doctor
 in the emergency, right?
[1627.10] No, no,
[1628.83] uncle, I guess my BP got low 
due to working in this heat,
[1632.90] so I just got dizzy 
and nothing else.
[1634.23] Sumbul, my child,
[1635.43] take your sister-in-law to her room
[1637.40] so she can rest for a while.
[1638.60] Sister-in-law?
[1639.47] She will rest for a while.
[1641.53] She has been working in this heat,
[1643.13] so she got unwell.
[1650.70] Give her support and 
take her, my child.
[1653.30] Look at the sensitive 
girls these days,
[1656.33] they get dizzy when they work 
in the heat for some time.
[1660.53] And then there were us,
[1661.53] we used to stand in front 
of the stove all day
[1663.67] but we never showed discomfort 
to either the in-laws or the husband.
[1668.07] Why are you comparing 
yourself to a young girl?
[1671.40] Hmm?
[1674.13] Mister,
[1675.40] you are joining from 
tomorrow then?
[1677.17] Absolutely.
[1678.23] Good, good.
[1688.90] Shall I tell him about
 Zunaira’s call?
[1691.87] No,
[1693.33] he might not like it
 when he hears about it.
[1702.30] If my dark past will come in front 
of him over and over again,
[1706.17] it might even stay in his heart.
[1716.80] What happened? Isn’t it good?
[1720.37] No, no,
[1721.97] it’s very good.
[1723.27] So then eat.
[1734.23] I don’t know what is going 
on in the house,
[1736.60] I don’t know if the people 
came with the proposal or not,
[1739.57] who should I ask?
[1740.97] I don’t even have a phone.
[1750.30] I mean,
[1752.73] my success has started to bother 
you so much, yeah?
[1756.13] You did this drama and took
 everyone’s attention to yourself.
[1760.23] Why would I dislike your success?
[1763.93] I don’t know, you would know it.
[1767.63] There is nothing like that,
[1769.97] I was just worried for Sania.
[1775.17] Why?
[1776.13] What did she do now?
[1779.93] Dad is looking for a match 
to get Sania married.
[1785.70] So that’s great.
[1788.03] Before she does
 something wrong,
[1791.27] it’s better to get her
 respectfully married.
[1794.90] And if you are done
 mourning for your sister,
[1798.07] do some work for me.
[1801.20] Take out clothes for me 
to wear in the morning,
[1802.30] take out my shoes,
[1803.90] I have to go.
[1825.07] Ask me if you find it difficult.
[1827.97] Today is your first day.
[1829.30] You will be an expert 
in a few days.
[1831.07] No, thank you.
[1831.93] You explained it really well.
[1834.23] I have understood. Thank you.
[1835.77] You are smart.
[1836.57] You will grasp it soon.
[1838.57] I hope so.
[1840.23] Boss is here.
[1846.47] What are you looking at?
[1851.63] He has some personality.
[1853.40] If we get so much money,
[1855.23] we won’t look any less.
[1857.33] You are right.
[1859.13] Focus on your work.
[1885.73] What if he finds out 
what you did to Mr. Sarkar,
[1891.03] he is a man,
[1893.30] who will make him believe
[1896.20] you are still a pure girl.
[1915.40] I don’t know what is 
the problem with you,
[1919.43] I just came back from the office,
[1921.03] Dad should have at least let
 me breathe for two minutes.
[1923.17] He sent me here with you.
[1927.03] I just got dizzy,
[1930.13] I told Uncle that
 there is no need.
[1937.57] Mrs. Sarfaraz,
[1939.77] come in, it’s your turn,
[1940.93] the doctor is calling you.
[1963.30] Greetings.
[1964.80] Greetings.
[1967.03] You are calling me at the 
time of coming back home,
[1970.37] don’t you have 
plans to come home?
[1972.20] Yes, I have a meeting,
[1973.40] I am heading there,
[1974.10] so I will be a bit late.
[1976.27] Oh, okay.
[1979.87] Were you missing me?
[1982.47] Yes.
[1983.63] If it wasn’t an important work,
[1984.80] I would have come.
[1986.37] Do one thing, go shopping,
[1988.10] I will ask the driver to take you.
[1991.00] What will I do by going shopping?
[1992.97] I already have so many things.
[1995.23] Just hang out a bit,
[1996.60] your mood will get better,
[1998.60] you look a bit upset right now.
[2000.73] No, I am not upset.
[2004.40] I will go if you say.
[2006.60] Okay,
[2007.43] I will ask the driver,
[2009.00] guards will also accompany you.
[2012.43] Take care of yourself.
[2014.57] Okay.
[2026.17] Yes, Doctor, is everything fine?
[2028.40] Everything is not fine,
[2029.50] in fact, there is good
 news for you guys.
[2037.83] Good news?
[2039.13] Yes,
[2039.77] a new guest is coming 
into your home.
[2043.20] You have to take 
very good care of her,
[2046.37] she is very weak.
[2047.97] I am prescribing some medicines,
[2049.77] start them very soon,
[2050.40] in fact, start them from today only.
[2055.27] Fiza, you have to take
 very good care of yourself.
[2058.67] Okay.
[2066.23] Doctor, this child shouldn’t be born.
