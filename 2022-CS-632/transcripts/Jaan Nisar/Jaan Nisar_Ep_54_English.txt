Hey, today you came home early. Why did you go to meet Sarfaraz? I went to meet Mother. If you really went to meet Mother,
then what is all this? Even after all this evidence,
you're still lying to me? I... I did go to meet Mother. I ran into Sarfaraz on the way. How did he know you'd be
taking that route? How did he know? Certainly, before meeting, a person calls and decides on a place. Sarfaraz's call is proof of that. What should I make of all this? No… It was just a coincidence. He called me because he wanted to meet, so he called me. In what capacity did he call you? Why did he want to meet?
What did he need to talk about? I stopped the car for this reason,
to talk to him and ask. You can lie to me this much?
I never could have imagined. I am not lying to you. I met Sarfaraz on the way, I didn’t plan it. If you want… you… you can ask the driver, you can ask the guard,
I was going to my mother’s house. Yes, only when you go
to your mother’s place will you get a chance to meet Sarfaraz. Ghaznavi, you… you're misunderstanding me completely. No, I'm no longer under
any misunderstanding about you. Now, that misunderstanding
has been cleared. My phone... You did all of this? How did you get pictures
of me and Sarfaraz? I just got them from somewhere. Are you concerned about the pictures,
or is it something else? What are you doing? You've put spies on me? With a woman like you, spying is necessary. Even Nosherwan Saeein should know what kind of woman his wife is. You’re playing with fire. Oh, I really don’t want to play with fire, that’s why I’m telling you to quietly go back to your parents’ house. Or, if you don't want to go there, go to Sarfaraz. Isn't that the best option? What hasn't he done for you? He’s made so many big sacrifices, even left his wife for you. Yet you’re still torturing him. Go to your lover! Enough! Stay within your limits. Stay within my limits? You’re telling me to
stay within my limits? And what about you? I know very well how to
deal with women like you. Next time if try to speak to me like this, I’ll remind you of all your limits. Hey, what are you guys doing? What’s going on here? Don’t you know how to behave? Is this how you play? In what manner are
you talking to the kids? Nosherwan, look what
they’ve done to the room. Something might break… If the room is messed up then
here are servants in the house, they will clean it up. Why are you shouting at them? I am not shouting I am just… Enough, don’t talk to the kids like this again. I won’t tolerate it. Arham, Mizna, come here. What were you doing? Why did you mess up
the room so much? I’ve told you to stay in your room. Now you have got yourself insulted. No, why should the kids
play in their room? This entire house is theirs.
They’ll play wherever they want, and no one will stop them. Nosherwan, you don’t understand. Maybe Dua doesn’t like me
or the kids being in this house. Ever since we’ve come here, she has had a lot of issues. If it weren't for Mizna and
Amma Saeein’s medical tests, I would have left for
the mansion long ago. If there's so much of a problem
with me and the kids, then I’ll call Amma Saeein and go back to the mansion. No one is going anywhere. Everyone will stay here. Let’s go. I’m ashamed. I shouldn’t have scolded
the kids like that. I don’t need your clarifications. I’m not clarifying. I just realized it,
that’s why I’m apologizing. I’ll explain to the kids. Do whatever you want.
Just go from here. Does my presence here
bother you this much? Yes, if I say that your presence makes
me question my patience, it wouldn’t be wrong. So it’s better, while I’m still angry,
you keep out of my sight. Go away. Yesterday, I scolded you guys too much, right? I’m sorry. Grown-ups don’t hold their ears, right? Kids hold their ears when the teacher says so. But if grown-ups make mistakes, they should also hold their ears. Sorry. You shouldn’t apologize. The mistake was ours. We were misbehaving. He was the one
who started the game first. And who started jumping on the bed? You said it. Alright, fine, fine, let’s do one thing, from now on the three
of us will play together. Okay? Okay. Mizna, Arham, the noodles are ready. Let’s go! Noodles! Okay Get out of my way. Why don’t you let out
the anger you have inside? If you’ve started hating me, then express that hate openly. Tell me, have you started hating me? When the time is right,
I will tell you this too. Who knew our daughters
would have such fates? We had to face someone
like Sarfaraz, a beast. He destroyed and
ruined our daughters' lives. Why are you thinking
of past things now? They have their
whole life ahead of them, think about the future for the girls. What will we do? Let the baby be born first. Then I’ll find a good match for her
and get her married. What else can I do? I don’t want to get married. I... I will spend my life with my child. But please, take the thought of my marriage
out of your hearts. But, child, how will you live such a long life? And what about my child... he will also live like an orphan, only because of Dua. If Dua hadn’t come into Sarfaraz’s life, none of this would have
happened to me. Mother, whatever my life is, long or short, however long it may be, I will live it with my child. But please don’t talk
to me about marriage, it frightens me. I fear that someone like Dua will again
become an obstacle in my path, and I’ll be punished for sins
I didn’t commit. What was my mistake? What sin did I commit? I always followed the principles
you set for me, Father. But what happened? Tell me! Dua’s sin is now a stain on
my life in the form of divorce. And my child, despite having a father,
will be deprived. Look, dear, Dua did very wrong. We all agree on that. She did something very bad. But she’s asking for forgiveness,
she’s remorseful. Forgive your sister. Don’t hold a grudge against her. I’m not holding a grudge, Father. Why don’t you all understand? Whatever happened to
me was because of Dua. If she hadn’t come
between us that day, Sarfaraz wouldn’t have divorced me. Sarfaraz divorced
me only because of Dua. He even confessed in front of all of you, so why don’t you understand? The disaster falling on me and
my unborn child is solely because of Dua, and I can never forgive her for it. Hey, Fiza, listen to me. Child… Oh God. You’re still upset? I told you, that I… I’m feeling sleepy. Go to sleep. I want to eat ice cream. Me too, but who will take us? We’ll go anyway, I want it. What’s all the noise about? Come here, what happened? Why are you making
so much noise? I want ice cream, I want, I want! You can’t eat ice cream right now, no ice cream for you. But I want to eat ice cream!
I want, I want, I want! What’s wrong? Uncle, I want to eat ice cream. Look at her, she’s insisting on eating ice cream. Her health just got better
after such difficulty. If she eats ice cream,
she’ll get sick again. It’s been a week
since her health improved, she can eat one ice cream. I’ll get it, Jafar. No, Uncle, I don’t want to eat ice cream at home. I want to eat it outside. It’s so much fun eating
ice cream outside! Yes, Uncle, we’ll go outside and eat ice cream, it’s so much fun! Okay, so you all want to
eat ice cream outside? Yes. Then what are we waiting for? Let’s go! Yay! But Uncle, take Aunt with us too. Yeah! No kids, just us. Let’s go! Sakina. Yes Please bring a strong cup of tea for me. I have a bad headache. Yes, I’ll bring it right away. I knew it. You can't stay angry with me for long. You... what are you doing here? What’s going on here? You... you called him to the room, Dua? No. You should be ashamed of yourself. No, I don't know how he came here. I don’t know! Dua, If the truth is out, then don’t lie. Tell everyone the truth, now. Stop with the nonsense, there’s nothing like that. Really, believe me. Today, no one can stop
me from killing him! Ghaznavi! What was the need to do this, huh? I don’t know how he got here. Nosherwan! Ghaznavi! Ghaznavi, no! For God’s sake please don’t. Please don’t kill him, please, please don’t do this. See? Even now, she still cares
so much about him. Fine, Dua. I’m leaving. Neither am I afraid of him nor his gun. Go away from here. Nosherwan What is all this? Whose stuff is this? He sent Fiza’s stuff back,
what else? Was it necessary to cause
this pain after the divorce? He had to complete the procedure.
He sent the stuff back, the poor guy was very distressed.
He called and was crying. What’s the point of
sending this stuff back? Our wounds will stay
fresh seeing all this. Look, sending the stuff
was their responsibility, and they fulfilled it. Now what’s the use
of talking about this? As soon as I see you,
I start losing control. I don’t know why it feels like you’ve
cast a spell on me. Am I right? I consider myself lucky to have your hand in mine. Me too And this will stay like this forever. Mine and yours, our journey
together was only till here. How long has all
this been going on? Huh, All this was happening
behind our backs? So Sarfaraz was right... Yes? This child then. Why are you talking about? I don’t know. I really don’t know how he got here. Now that’s what you’ll say. The guard, the caretaker,
all of them are lying? They said Sarfaraz keeps coming
to meet you with your consent. Now that you’re caught, deny it all. Ghaznavi, she’s lying. I’m telling the truth. When someone is caught,
they say the same…. You, you do believe what I’m saying, right? Yes, everyone’s lying, and only you are telling the truth. If nothing was going on
between the two of you, then why didn’t you let me kill him? Why did you shield him from me? I didn’t want you to be
called his murderer. I didn’t want you to kill him. Whatever was supposed to happen to me,
I would’ve let it happen. A man comes into my house, plays with my honor right in front of me, and is still alive only because of you. You saved him. You’re misunderstanding me. How do I explain to you that what you saw wasn’t the truth? I’ve understood everything about
what’s true and what’s false. I leave you, and then you go straight to Sarfaraz? That’s your plan, right?
The two of you? As long as I’m alive,
I won’t let that happen. You’ll stay in this house. I won’t leave you until my last breath. But now, I’ll never turn to look
at your face again. Ghaznavi, Ghaznavi! Please listen to me, please. I don’t know why
he was saying all that. Who else would know? Why are you asking me? Should I ask a third person
about you and Sarfaraz? Who should I ask? I have no relationship with him. Right, you have no connection with him. Then why is he saying all this nonsense? I’ll ask you directly then. Who is the father of this child?
