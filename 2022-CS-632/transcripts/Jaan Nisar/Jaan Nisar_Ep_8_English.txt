Come, let’s sit here. Umm, no, let’s sit outside. Hey, why would you sit outside? I have to give you a surprise. Sit inside, come. And this is not my room, this is our room. Come. Sit down, I will be right back. Why are you closing the door? You do understand 
the meaning of surprise, right? I want to give you a surprise, that’s why I am closing it. Look, Mom will come, she will suddenly open the door and you will be sitting here, she will like it, right? You just sit and relax, I will be right back, okay? Fehmida? Fehmida? Yes, yes, I am coming. Are the girls back from the salon? They will come, they just went, it takes time to get ready. I asked you not to send them, but you guys are
 so obsessed with fashion, do you even listen to anyone? Why do you worry? They just went nearby, they will be back. They won’t come soon, I know these salon girls, they will make
 them sit there for 4 hours so they can hog money from them, if they don’t come back in time, I will be the worst! I will be the worst! Oh God, oh God, I just hope
 girls come back in time else there will be a huge scene. What was I doing? If I get too late, Dad will scold me a lot. I'll get a serious scolding. Take something out of it. Wear this, it will look nice on you. This will look better with the dress. Yellow looks nice with yellow only. Hey Sumbul, where is your brother? Dad, brother is at the salon. What do you mean by 
he is still at the salon? Have you seen the time? When will he come home, dress up as the groom and when will we leave? He has been gone for a while now, he will be back anytime. What do you mean by
 he will be back anytime? Brother Aslam will get very upset 
if the groom and family arrive late. Hey, what’s there to be upset about? Delays do happen during the weddings. What do you mean by delays do happen? I will send someone to bring him, in fact, do one thing, call him and ask him to immediately come home. Yes, yes, Dad, I… Silly boy. Quickly give me the stopper. Where is my phone? I will just call him. Okay fine. Wear this, this is not going through. Do one thing, wear the other one as well, show me. Oh, it’s you, I got scared. What’s there to be scared about? I don’t see your mother and sister. I told Mom, I have told her that 
my friends are coming, she will be here in a bit. You come here and sit. Okay. Come. This color looks very nice on you and wear the same 
color on our wedding day. Faraz, I am getting very late, I have to get home before
 the groom and family arrive. Hey, I know that, meet mom and have juice then we will leave. This is not needed. Dua? You have come to my,
 not my home but our home for the first time and you know what
 Mom was saying? She was saying that let your friend go 
after having dinner. No, no, this is enough. Yes. You have it. What are you thinking? Nothing, I was just thinking I wish it was our wedding today. You look so beautiful, I can’t even tell you. Please, ask Aunt to come soon then we will leave. Yes, I will ask her, I will. Finish it, come on, come on. That’s it. What happened, Dua? Is everything okay? I feel, I feel dizzy. Okay, okay, then you rest, lie down. I have to go home and… Dua? Faraz? Boys like us only get 
married by our parents’ choice, we just befriend girls
 like you to have a good time, I did love you though
 only for some time. Yes? yes, Dad? Where are you? The whole family is ready here and the groom is missing. I am just leaving, 
I am just leaving. All I know is that you have to immediately be here, right now, do you understand? I am coming, I am coming. I hope everything is well at home, I hope Dad won’t be getting angry. Where is Dua? It has been so late. You sisters were in
 such a rush to get ready, and now that you are ready, your sister hasn’t come to pick you. I was thinking this myself, I don’t know 
why hasn’t she come yet. They might be thinking that there is still time for 
me to get ready so… Will you do me a favor? Can you send someone to
 my home with a message, then they will come to pick me up. Sorry, how can 
I send someone? Do one thing, call them. Umm, do you know, I don’t have a phone. Okay, if you don’t have a phone, someone at your 
home would have it, give me their number, and I will call them from my phone. Yes, there is, our Dad has a phone but I don’t remember his number. Then you just wait, we have been very 
late too because of you. Hmm, keep this too. Sir, all the preparations are completed, what do you think, shall we move forward? Yes, we will just go. These are 4,000, 6,000, 45,000, Oh God, what sort of .
a bill have you made? I asked you not to, I even asked my wife that I wouldn’t pay that much. Hey brother Aslam, you are getting your 
first daughter married, don’t worry about the bill, I have spoken to sister-in-law, we will do it, we will do it, that’s not a problem. Look Muzammil, 
I won’t give you a single penny, I am honestly telling you. Brother Aslam,  no problem, 
we will do it later. Okay fine. Put this properly, do it. Fehmida? Fehmida? Where are both of them? They haven’t come back yet. I don’t know what’s taking them so long, they should have
 been back by now. Hey, all the boys of the world are
 standing outside in the tent, now they will pass them with
 their faces full of makeup, it will be like Doom’s Day, I should die of shame. Why are you thinking like this? Both of them are
 covered in a long veil, they would be wearing it. 5 minutes, you and your daughters
 just have 5 minutes, if they don’t come back
 in the next 5 minutes, it will be the end of times! I will go check. Sania, get my veil from inside, I will go check myself why the salon girl made 
her sit there for so long. Okay, it means you will go alone
 to the salon at this time in this condition? It’s just 2 streets away, I will immediately 
go and bring them. No, I am not the shameless that I would let you go alone. I will come along too. Your daughters will bring disgrace to 
me in front of the whole world. He won’t be able to do anything. Give it to me. I am afraid that
 sisters might get scolded. Hey? The auto rickshaw is here, call the daughters. Hey, what was the need for this? The house is just in the back street, we could have walked. Yeah sure, spread shamelessness, spread all the shamelessness you want. You want people to get attracted
 to our girls' bangles. The ones who are not even looking, you will show it to them as well. I was just saying. You were just saying. My daughter looks so beautiful. And what about Dua?
 Isn’t she ready yet? Yeah? I am telling you honestly, 
Fehmida Begum, I am not going to spare you. I won’t even wait till we get home. Speak slowly. Where is she, my child? Call her. Mom, Dua left two hours ago. Where? Where did she go? Hun What are you saying, my child? Where is Dua? Both of us are 
here to pick both of you. Mom, actually, I had to get ready and she was ready, the beautician said 
it would take two hours, so Dua said I would go 
home and help Mom, and I asked her to 
come before 2 hours, it was so late, I was waiting for 
her to pick me up. Damn it! She didn’t get home, it got so late that is why we came 
here to pick both of you. Mom, Dua is not here. She didn’t even get home then where did she go? I don’t understand. Hey? Hey, the groom’s family 
is about to be here and you guys are putting
 up this show here? It is all your fault, Fehmida Begum, it’s all your fault, I even told you not to send 
them to the beauty parlor, now look, the daughter went missing. What are you saying? I? What am I saying? Where did Dua go? Tell me. She might be at someone’s 
house in our street. Her hair wasn’t getting fixed so she said… She might be at 
Sister Bilquees’s house. Let me just find her today, I will kill her. come, come and sit in the rickshaw. Come. Come. What should I do? I should inform Baba Saeein. Hello, yes Baba Saeein, Baba Saeein, Saeein Jr got shot, yes Baba Saeein I am at the hospital. Yes. Come. Come, my son. Hey, where is the forehead garland? What do I know? I will bring it myself. Hey. So, did you tell Dua? Why would I tell her? We broke up. Break up? You look exactly like a hero. Obviously, I will look like a hero when I am a hero. I am getting a call, I will be right back. Yeah, yeah sure. My son looks so handsome. Sarfaraz, my Dad got unwell, he has been taken to the hospital, so I won’t be able to make it
 to the wedding with you. Hey, no, no, you must go, he needs you. Pray for him. Yes, son, you must go. Go. May God keep things well. Where is your Dad? He was in so much rush to go and now I don’t know where did he go to get the garland. Go and check him. I will go see. My son looks very nice. We even went to Bilquees’s house, Hmmm she was not even there, did the sky hog her, or did the ground swallow her? Where did she go? For God’s sake, Mr. Aslam, speak slowly, the guests are sitting
 outside our house. I think your girl ran with some lover and you are asking 
me to speak slowly? Hey, Dua is not like this, God knows how
my daughter would be. If she is not like that then go find her and bring her. Otherwise, I will hang you 
and everyone to a fan and shoot myself, there wouldn’t be a wedding 
at home but a funeral. Oh Fehmida, Fehmida, this is your leverage that your daughters are
 throwing dirt on my face today. Why are you thinking this? She could have even met an accident, may my words have no effect but she could have
 been kidnapped too. However, the dirt will
 be on me in both cases. My, my heart is sinking Mr. Aslam, for God’s sake find her 
somewhere and bring her home. Who should I go and ask? The groom’s family? One of the daughters has eloped and the other one is ready. Why do you want people to throw the dirt 
of defamation on me instead of congratulating
 me for the wedding? I cannot even sit here and cry, go find my daughter somehow. Tell me what should I do? She must have 
a friend or someone, someone she knows. Ask her, the friends usually 
know everything that whom is she having an affair with. Rida, Rida, she is just 
friends with sister Rida. So then ask her, get me her phone number. Do you have her number? Sister once wrote it in my copy. Go get it. I will bring it. And look at you, you are here all dressed up, you so wanted to be a bride, you couldn’t have 
stopped your sister. Now you are looking at my face. She is rubbing dirt on my face. Oh God. Here, this is sister Rida’s number. Quickly give it to me. Show it to me. Pray, just keep on praying. Hello? Dua’s father speaking. Yes? Yes, Uncle? I am just here. Rida, Sister Rida is here herself. Greetings, Aunt. How are you? I couldn’t see any of you outside so I came in myself. Where is Dua? I don’t see her around. This, we called you to ask this. Dua invited me to Fiza’s wedding. What do you guys want to ask me? Where is Dua? Tell us. Why are you guys asking me this? She went to the salon and didn’t come back. Do you know where did she go? How can I tell, uncle, where did she go? Friends know everything if their friend is having 
an affair with someone. Look uncle, Dua hasn’t even been coming
 to the university for so many days and it has been so many days 
that I haven’t even met her. I don’t know. Hey, I am asking 
who did Dua elope with? How can I tell, Uncle? And why would she run 
away from home anyway? My child, my child, there is no
 clue of Dua anywhere, if you know something just tell us. Look, Aunt, I honestly don’t know anything. I don’t know anything. You guys should 
call Dua’s number, she will tell you herself
 as to where she is. Dua’s, Dua’s phone? Since when did she have a phone? She never had a phone. Uncle, Dua had a phone. My child, that was your phone and she returned it to you 
the very next day. No Aunt, you guys definitely have 
some misunderstanding, it was Dua’s phone, now only Dua can tell where 
the phone came from or who gave it to her, how can I tell? My child, you give me the phone number, give it to me. I will send it to you. I have sent it to you, uncle. Call her. You are looking at my face. Okay now, I will leave then, Aunt. Bye. Where is our Nosherwan? How is Nosherwan? Sir, his operation is going on. How did all this happen? We were on our way, and the snipers attacked us. Saeein, I don’t have the courage to 
lose Nosherwan after Zawar now. Amma Saeein. Do you believe me now? Yeah? Fehmida? Are you satisfied now that your daughter has eloped? If she hadn’t run away, someone would have stopped her, she would have made some noise, and the people at the salon
 would have come out to help her. Admit that she has
 run away with her lover. No, Dua is not that kind of a girl, she cannot do this. If she cannot do this then tell me where did she get a phone from? God knows, I don’t know about the phone. Oh wow! Your daughter has a mobile phone and the mother doesn’t even know. I saw it with her once, and she said it was her friend’s, she returned it the next day. Just let me speak on 
the phone once, then to all three of you, I will… Dad? Dad, please. How is my son? He is out of danger. He got shot in the shoulder. He will be conscious 
after some time and then we will shift
 him to the room. As you know it’s a police case, so please handle it. Thank you. Thank you. God had mercy on my motherhood. Your daughter is not 
picking up the phone. She can also be in some trouble. What trouble? There is nothing difficult for girls
 who run away from home. Dua is not that kind of a girl, I am sure something
 bad has happened to her. What kind of a girl she is, that’s in front of everyone now. Mother doesn’t even know that her daughter 
has a mobile phone, I will give you a … Dad? Dad, please. Please. Oh God, save my honor. Hey Dua, pick up the phone. What is the update on Dua? Yes, it was her sister’s wedding today. Okay, but I told you… Nosherwan. You made everyone worried, Jaffar. Worried what? May you get your mother’s life. God has given you a new life. How is my lion? I am fine, Baba Sahab, I am fine. Nosherwan, everyone got so worried after hearing
 about the attack on you. Where are the kids? They are at the mansion. We couldn’t think of anything else 
after hearing about the news of your attack. But still, you shouldn’t have left
the kids alone and come here like this. Don’t worry, Priya and the other
 servants are with them. Oh, careful, careful. May God send that ill-bred to hell, he attacked my motherhood. My son. Mr. Aslam, the groom, and his
 family have arrived outside. Really? Go and make everyone sit. What should I do now? What should I do? Tell me. Should I go out and tell 
everyone that the girl ran away? For God’s sake, 
be quiet, Mr. Aslam. Why are you ruining her fate 
because of one daughter? What should I do then? Tell me. Dua, let me just get you once, I will kill you myself. Whatever will happen
 with that ill-fated, it will happen later, think about this daughter, what is her fault? At least let this poor girl get married. So then what should I do? Yeah? I should go happily to the people? I won’t be able to do that. We have to do it, Mr. Aslam, we have to do 
the exact same thing. We have to go through this test to 
respectfully get Fiza married, no matter if our hearts 
are crying from inside, we still have to smile. Yeah and what should
 I tell everyone about Dua? I will handle it, you just go and welcome 
the groom and family. It would have been better had 
I died before witnessing this day. Come, Sania, come, you come with me, come. And look fix your face. Smile. Smile and go. Fiza, my child, you go inside and fix yourself, wipe the tears, okay? And tell everyone that Dua is not well, she is not well
 she is resting in her room, okay? I will go out. Dua. Where are you?
