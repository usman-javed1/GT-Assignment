[29.30] Why did you not say no to Papa?
[31.93] When did he ask me?
[33.73] If he had not asked you,
[35.97] then you should have said no, yourself.
[38.90] He was talking to you and Mama,
what could I say?
[41.77] Yes, why would you say anything?
[44.13] Because your heart's desire to go
for outings with me is being fulfilled.
[48.67] I understand women like you well.
[51.43] You should have said no.
[53.80] If you don’t want to take me out then
[57.40] you say no to Papa yourself.
[59.50] Meaning, I become bad in his eyes, right?
[61.80] It hurts. Please.
[64.27] Fiza, you have no idea
how I am tolerating you in my home.
[68.30] In my life.
[71.07] If I could, I would push you out of here.
[74.37] What have I done?
[75.80] Why do you hate me so much?
[77.57] What have you done?
[80.97] I have not even started
hating you right now.
[84.03] I have tolerated you
because of Papa right now.
[87.77] I have not left you.
it would be better for you
[89.67] that you leave from here, yourself.
[91.53] What is my fault to deserve
this behavior from you?
[93.87] It is your fault!
[130.63] What?
[131.70] Do you want to buy the entire
shopping mall today?
[134.30] I have just bought a dress for Sumbul.
[137.00] I was wondering if we could get
a dress for Mama as well.
[143.13] Listen to me,
[144.40] you don’t need to act so good.
[146.77] If Mama likes something,
if she wants something,
[149.03] then she will buy it herself.
No, I will just check over there,
[151.97] if I find something good quickly.
I will not delay.
[159.23] Rida.
[161.67] Rida.
[162.83] Fiza.
[170.27] Rida.
[172.87] Rida.
[176.63] Rida, where is Dua?
[177.97] Where is Dua?
[179.47] What do you mean?
[181.83] And why are you asking me this?
[185.17] She must have come to you.
[186.67] She would have surely contacted you.
[192.10] How can you say this with
so much surety?
[196.73] Because after being
disappointed with all of us,
[199.40] she would have surely come to you.
[201.67] You are her only friend.
[203.37] I am not her friend, I was her friend.
[207.20] Until I didn’t know that
she ran away from her home,
[211.83] that too with someone.
[213.97] Rida,
[215.70] you are a really good friend of hers.
You know Dua is not like that.
[219.87] She is not like that?
[221.53] Then why did she run away from home?
[224.93] Something really bad has surely happened.
[227.77] Dua is not like that.
[230.17] Look, I have nothing to do with
how your sister is, and how she isn’t,
[236.23] and you are wasting my time
asking me these questions.
[239.87] Rida, please, just tell me one thing,
[245.33] who was that boy in her life?
[248.90] She must have told you about him.
[253.53] Where did she get that phone from?
[255.63] That boy must have given her that phone,
[257.50] which became the reason
for her life getting ruined.
[261.53] Look, I am not asking you anything.
[264.30] Just tell me the name and address,
[266.37] and I will find out the rest myself.
[270.07] That boy will surely know
where my Dua is.
[272.77] What condition is she in?
Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Listen to me.
[276.80] I don’t know that boy.
[281.23] I don’t know about any boy.
[284.10] And as far as Dua is concerned,
[286.47] then, yes,
[287.90] after being rejected by your father
she came straight to me,
[292.30] to request me to give her
a place to stay in my home.
[298.37] We are respectable people and Dua?
[302.03] The place from where Dua
has been caught …
[303.90] that place,
[304.97] after that the police station,
then the police,
[307.10] after all this,
how can I keep her in my home?
[312.57] That’s why, I asked her
to leave from home.
[316.03] Now, I don’t know where she is.
[317.50] What condition is she in?
[321.87] And look,
[323.27] if you see me somewhere after today,
[326.33] don’t try to call out to me
and stop me like this.
[330.10] Along with Dua,
her friendship is also over.
[354.70] Who was this girl?
[356.53] I will deal with you when we get home.
Come on.
[370.40] The feeling of your presence
[372.37] has made the walls and doors of
this house even more beautiful.
[376.50] And your companionship has
given me a new life.
[383.80] My heart desires to bring everything
in the world to your feet.
[390.63] To give you everything I have.
[395.47] But I didn’t marry you
out of any greed.
[399.00] I know this.
[402.07] Then,
[404.57] you have done a lot of favors for me.
[408.30] Even if there is nothing,
[411.27] I will still always stay loyal to you.
[416.67] I have not done any favors.
[420.10] And when did I say that I am doing
all this to gain your loyalty?
[426.27] You didn’t say it.
[428.27] But I know,
[434.53] you have done a lot for me.
[438.97] First Zunaira, and then that cheque.
[441.40] Forget all that.
[445.83] No,
[448.77] you took me out of that hell,
[451.93] where I went myself knowingly
or unknowingly.
[457.87] You have done me a big favor.
[465.30] You giving me your name is
a big enough favor for me.
[474.03] Your companionship gives me
the feeling of being protected.
[482.53] I will not permit you to cry.
[491.43] Who was in your life and who wasn’t,
doesn’t matter to me.
[497.20] What will make a difference is when
[499.97] someone else will get a place
in your life after me.
[505.07] Never.
[507.97] I will never let this happen.
[513.27] All my faithfulness is just for you.
[536.90] Jaffar.
[541.20] Come on.
[555.27] This…
[556.10] Tell me something.
[558.80] Who were you running after in the mall?
[563.70] I just wanted to find out about Dua.
[569.67] Why don’t you get this in your head
[572.33] that you don’t take that girl’s name?
[575.00] I lost control seeing Rida.
[577.50] She was Dua’s only friend
[580.63] and she will surely know where Dua is.
[583.43] She has admitted that she was
the last person Dua contacted.
[587.10] Who has met whom, what they have been
up to is not your headache.
[592.90] Let me find out about Dua, Sarfaraz.
[596.23] Rida will surely know
what boy she was in touch with.
[600.07] You will find out? Huh?
[601.90] You will find out.
[603.83] Yes.
[604.60] What will you find out? Huh?
[607.23] That who she….
[608.70] She didn’t do it.
How many times have I told you?
[611.77] My sister Dua is not like that.
[613.97] Enough!
[615.37] Quiet!
[617.50] If you take her name now,
then I am telling you,
[619.80] I will leave you forever.
[654.07] Sir.
[656.50] Madam got really angry hearing my voice.
[659.43] Hmmm.
[661.97] But it has never happened before today
that I gave you a task and you didn’t do it.
[667.90] Why is it happening this time?
[679.90] Why are you hiding it?
[683.50] Sir,
[685.30] I am afraid of a conflict.
[694.60] Name.
[701.47] Jaffar I asked you for the name!
[710.33] Madam Kashmala.
[758.20] What happened?
Where are you going?
[759.77] Nothing.
[760.83] Where are you going?
At least, tell me.
[823.33] There was an attack last night too,
[825.80] and even now he left
so angry taking out the gun.
[829.27] What is all this that is happening?
I don’t understand anything.
[832.73] May God be kind.
[846.77] Who asked for this?
[848.63] Sir left saying that we should take
special care of you till he returns.
[852.20] If you need anything,
then you just order me, madam.
[857.50] No,
[858.73] I don’t need anything.
[860.33] Yes.
[861.27] Listen.
[863.40] Do you know where sir went?
[868.63] Stop.
[873.50] When do we know where
sir comes and goes, madam?
[882.73] Fine.
[884.47] You can leave.
[924.60] Madam, tea.
[928.97] I don’t want it. take it away.
[931.07] Why are you burning your heart, madam?
[935.33] What do I do if I don’t burn it? huh?
[938.93] I called your sir,
[940.87] he gave the phone to Jaffar.
[943.17] He always does this with me.
[945.00] Why did you call younger sir?
[950.13] Meaning?
[951.53] I had explained it to you.
[954.30] You just talk straight,
I am really angry.
[957.53] I will take out all my anger on you.
[959.10] Just say what you want straight.
[961.77] Take out your anger.
[963.57] Nothing is worth more to me,
more than you.
[966.80] Go, do your work. Come on.
[969.80] Why didn’t you call that girl
instead of calling younger sir?
[975.73] You needed to make
your position clear to her.
[980.00] Younger sir is very fond of her.
[983.37] Just try telling her your position.
[986.83] Then see how sir listens to you.
[994.90] Give me tea now that
you have brought it.
[1028.20] Madam, there is a call for you.
[1030.53] For me?
Yes.
[1032.63] Fine. You can leave.
[1036.93] Where did you go in
so much haste, Ghaznavi?
[1039.87] This is Kashmala.
[1042.87] Kashmala?
[1045.53] But I don’t know any woman
by that name.
[1049.90] I think the maid made a mistake,
she gave me the phone and left.
[1054.00] No. No.
[1055.47] No one had a misunderstanding.
[1058.53] I called to talk to you.
[1062.27] To me?
[1064.17] But, I don’t know you.
[1067.00] That’s why I have called you
[1069.23] so that I can introduce myself.
[1071.97] You are the same one
[1073.43] who picked up Nosherwan’s phone that day.
[1075.83] Yes, maybe.
[1079.53] But how do you know Ghaznavi?
[1084.97] I am your Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s wife.
[1091.50] Wife?
[1092.83] Why?
[1093.70] Did you get a shock?
[1098.10] Did he not tell you?
[1100.33] Okay, I will tell you.
[1102.03] By knowing my status, you must have
realized your own worth very well.
[1107.10] You were brought here
just for amusement.
[1110.20] You are not worthy of being called
a wife or a family daughter-in-law.
[1116.10] If that were the case,
[1117.63] both Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein
would have been present at your wedding.
[1121.47] No one has accepted your marriage.
[1127.57] For the insolence of trying to take my place,
[1131.27] you will definitely be punished.
[1136.47] Very soon, I will throw you
out of Nosherwan's life.
[1194.03] Greetings.
[1194.87] Greetings. Nosherwan,
you came suddenly, son.
[1212.50] I had no idea
[1216.27] that someone who appears harmless
on the surface could strike in such a way.
[1227.27] If you had not been my brother’s widow,
[1231.27] then I would have told you what I could do.
[1237.67] Nosherwan,
[1239.93] son, what has happened…
[1241.43] Ask her!
[1243.87] Ask her,
[1245.40] what she was thinking when she had
a vicious attack made on Dua.
[1254.30] Why did you do this?
[1258.57] What did you think
[1261.60] that the truth would never reach me?
[1266.90] In future…
[1269.60] in future, if you try to plan
anything against Dua,
[1275.43] then remember I am standing
in front of her as a shield,
[1283.97] and if anyone tries to harm her
[1288.43] then I will deal with them harshly.
[1296.43] I am forgiving it considering it
your first and last mistake,
[1301.90] but I will not forgive it in the future.
[1304.83] Now that you have stood
in front of me in her support,
[1310.60] then deal with me harshly.
[1326.47] Only you will be the one
who will face loss in this.
[1328.97] What has to happen,
should happen.
[1335.57] But I will not let her stay in your life.
[1338.07] Kashmala,
[1340.70] do you have any idea
who you are talking in front of?
[1343.43] I know it well.
[1347.37] I know it well.
[1350.47] I am speaking in front of the man
[1354.37] who never fulfilled the responsibility
of the marriage he did with me.
[1363.03] Did you find a girl infamous
in the world to stand against me?
[1367.80] Mind what you say.
[1373.77] I will not tolerate a single word against, Dua.
[1377.17] Hey, why will you tolerate it?
[1380.53] Why will you tolerate it?
[1382.90] She is your favorite woman.
Kashmala,
[1386.97] who gave you the right
[1389.57] to talk to your husband like this?
[1391.57] Husband?
[1395.67] When the husband puts dirt in your head,
[1399.30] then I will question.
[1401.57] I will surely question him.
[1403.53] Nosherwan,
[1405.83] she is going mad.
[1407.63] She has forgotten respect
for the young and old.
[1412.00] You, go,
[1413.47] I will make her understand.
[1415.20] Because of you…
[1419.57] I have to see this day,
only because of you.
[1430.43] Make her understand in your words,
[1435.93] or her demeanor is forcing me
[1440.97] to snatch away the reason
to live here from her.
[1447.67] You leave, son.
[1453.00] He will throw me out?
[1457.90] He will snatch the reason
for living here from me?
[1464.23] Come to your senses, Kashmala.
[1467.13] He will…
Kashmala.
[1470.63] Kashmala.
[1496.77] Why have you become
the enemy of your own life?
[1500.10] What was the need to talk
to Nosherwan in this manner?
[1506.40] Amma Saeein,
[1508.83] how can you say this?
[1511.93] Didn't you see,
[1514.50] He was questioning me for that girl
who just arrived yesterday?
[1518.73] He was threatening me with serious
consequences for that worthless girl.
[1524.13] Be thankful that
he only questioned you.
[1527.40] What would you have done
if he had given a harsh reply?
[1533.33] You will say that.
[1536.53] He is your son.
[1539.90] Who am I?
[1542.23] Just a daughter-in-law.
[1544.37] Who was first married to one son and
then after that married to the other,
[1551.30] without any liking.
[1556.13] Amma Saeein, I had not asked you people
[1561.00] to marry me to Nosherwan
after I became a widow.
[1567.97] This was the decision of you
and Baba Saeein.
[1573.80] Yes, Kashmala,
[1575.67] this was our decision.
[1578.60] And we made this decision for
the betterment of you and the children.
[1582.57] How can you say it's betterment,
Amma Saeein?
[1586.43] What kind of betterment is this?
[1588.90] From the day of the wedding until today,
[1591.90] he stands at the same point of
estrangement as he did then.
[1598.23] And Amma Saeein,
I wouldn't have sighed,
[1601.87] I wouldn't have said anything,
I would have stayed silent.
[1606.03] But this sorrow of a co-wife,
I cannot bear, Amma Saeein.
[1611.97] Get a grip on yourself, Kashmala.
[1615.80] Understand this,
[1618.27] Nosherwan is a man,
and a man can get married again.
[1624.90] Maybe he did something good.
[1628.93] He took out a helpless girl from
that quicksand, gave her his name,
[1633.30] and gave her respect.
[1636.07] He is giving her a chance
to live a clean life.
[1641.67] You should be proud of
such a husband, Kashmala.
[1644.43] How can I be proud of him, Amma Saeein?
[1647.37] What are you saying?
[1652.10] I would have accepted if he never
looked at me for the rest of his life.
[1657.47] I would have stayed quietly
in a corner, Amma Saeein.
[1662.37] But I cannot tolerate
another woman with him.
[1666.10] Not at any cost.
[1671.93] Now,
[1674.43] Now, you are being selfish.
[1677.63] What do you want?
[1679.57] My son lives his life with a desolate heart.
[1687.00] Once before, we asked him to sacrifice
his heart for your sake, and he did.
[1693.80] Now, after so many years,
[1696.10] his heart is beating for someone again,
[1699.73] and you want to make the ground of
his heart barren with your sighs?
[1707.93] And me, Amma Saeein?
[1710.10] What about my heart?
[1713.47] What do I do about this heart?
[1717.17] I am his wife, Amma Saeein.
[1719.73] This is an injustice to me.
[1723.53] Amma Saeein, do something.
[1726.20] I can beg you, Amma Saaein.
[1730.10] I cannot see Nosherwan
with that girl, Amma Saaein.
[1734.17] I cannot see him with her.
[1736.87] I fall to your feet, do something.
[1741.30] Take out that girl, Amma Saeein. Please.
[1745.63] Amma Saeein!
[1749.00] Amma Saeein!
[1755.70] Amma Saeein, please.
[1768.83] I am your Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s wife.
[1773.83] Did he not tell you?
[1777.53] By knowing my status, you must have
realized your own worth very well.
[1782.20] You were brought here just for amusement.
[1784.43] You are not worthy of being called a wife
or a family daughter-in-law.
[1793.83] If that were the case,
[1795.57] both Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein
would have been present at your wedding.
[1799.30] No one has accepted your marriage.
[1804.57] For the insolence of trying
to take my place,
[1808.27] you will definitely be punished.
[1813.63] Very soon, I will throw you
out of Nosherwan's life.
[1840.87] Hmmm.
[1843.20] So, you did what you wanted.
[1847.50] You got married to that girl.
[1851.87] I had given Dua my word,
Baba Saeein.
[1856.37] Had I gone against my word,
[1859.90] then I would have become
a liar in front of her.
[1861.80] Instead of maintaining our dignity
in front of that girl
[1866.27] who came into your life yesterday,
you kept your word.
[1869.17] So why have you come here now?
That’s not true.
[1873.23] Your respect has always been in my heart.
[1877.47] Had that not been the case,
[1880.27] then I could have even done this earlier.
[1884.00] Had I done this,
[1887.33] then Farah would have been
in Dua’s place,
[1890.23] and Kashmala wouldn’t have been
seen anywhere in this mansion.
[1892.87] Oh,
[1895.33] so you came to remind us of the favor
you did to us by sacrificing.
[1900.97] No, Baba Saeein.
[1904.80] I am just trying to tell you
[1909.40] that if I had to go against your decision,
[1913.60] then I could have done this earlier too.
[1915.77] You have still done it.
[1917.27] You should have done it earlier.
[1919.63] At least, Farah was from
a respectable family.
[1921.57] Stop it, Saeein.
[1925.73] Dua too is from a respectable family.
[1931.13] Had an accident not made her reach there,
[1935.67] then you wouldn’t have said
this for her, today.
[1937.17] But, I want to say…
Saeein,
[1940.13] what are you doing?
[1941.93] Now that girl is our daughter-in-law.
[1947.20] Baba Saeein, even though
I live far from you all,
[1951.67] your blood runs through my veins.
[1956.37] What do you think,
[1958.73] can your blood do anything
[1963.13] that would make people question
our family’s honor and lineage?
[1970.33] Baba Saeein, don’t you trust your son?
[1973.37] I trusted you,
[1979.23] that you will not let anyone other than
Kashmala come into your life.
[1984.83] What did you do?
I am helpless.
[1989.90] I am helpless, Baba Saeein.
[1995.27] I cannot express in words
[2000.67] what Brother Zawar means
to me in my heart.
[2006.47] Therefore,
[2007.80] when you expressed your desire to keep
his widow and children in this mansion after him,
[2016.23] considering them his last attachment,
[2021.10] I did not refuse.
[2028.43] and built a grave on my heart!
[2033.27] But believe me,
even after all these years,
[2038.27] I still haven’t been able
to overcome his influence.
[2044.87] That’s why
[2048.63] I don’t refuse from a religious
perspective on marriage.
[2054.50] But certain positions are
decided by the heart.
[2061.57] Please,
[2064.77] find someone else for Kashmala
with her approval.
[2069.30] Are you in your senses?
What are you saying?
[2072.53] You are talking about marrying off
your wife to someone else.
[2076.50] I am in my senses, that’s why
I am saying this, Baba Saeein.
[2087.03] We will not get anything from
this relationship other than loss.
[2092.50] Kashmala’s deprivations are pushing
her towards seeking revenge from me.
[2098.17] What revenge did that poor thing take?
[2101.27] She is innocent.
[2103.93] Why are you making allegations about her?
[2118.23] Kashmala was the one who orchestrated
the attack on me and my caravan.
