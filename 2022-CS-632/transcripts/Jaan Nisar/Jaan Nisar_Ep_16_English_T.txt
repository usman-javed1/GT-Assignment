[25.20] You do remember that you have 
promised me to get me out of here, right?
[29.00] I remember everything,
[30.67] I am just looking for 
an appropriate chance.
[33.63] By the way,
[34.77] tell me, where would you go 
after getting out of here?
[37.57] I mean,
[38.63] will your family accept you?
[43.83] I don’t know,
[46.47] I haven’t thought of it yet.
[48.23] Hmm,
[49.37] if you haven't thought about it, 
start thinking about it already,
[52.87] I am afraid that after 
getting out of this hell,
[55.87] another hell might be waiting 
for you outside,
[59.03] and you might not find a Rumi 
to save you there.
[65.20] Okay tell me something,
[68.17] when you can get me out of here,
[71.73] didn’t you ever think of 
getting out of here yourself?
[75.93] You,
[77.10] why are you here?
[78.67] Why didn’t you run away from here?
[81.03] Even, I was very enthusiastic to 
get out of here like you before,
[86.53] I used to think that
[88.40] a new world would also be waiting 
for me when I got out of here
[93.27] and one day, I even looked for 
a chance and ran out of here.
[99.63] Then,
[101.27] why did you come back?
[102.97] Did Zunaira find you?
[106.27] No,
[107.70] I came back myself.
[110.97] Why?
[113.47] I went straight to my family 
after getting out of here,
[117.33] I cried and told them all the events
 that happened to me.
[121.27] I told them
[122.67] how I was used and 
thrown on Zunaira’s door.
[127.63] But then you know 
what happened to me?
[130.60] After listening to my story,
[133.27] my family disowned me,
[137.20] they felt if my ill-fortunate steps
 got into their house,
[143.20] my other sisters would be 
considered like me as well.
[147.80] That’s it,
[149.10] the doors of my house were closed on me.
[153.43] Hunger, empty road,
[156.87] and wolves that were present in places
[159.70] started to scare me 
in the darkness of the night,
[162.77] and then I thought of 
Zunaira’s luxurious mansion,
[166.60] Zunaira wanted the same from me,
[169.20] and in return, I got this luxury lifestyle,
[173.43] it wasn’t a bad deal for me.
[175.63] And then I decided I would never go back
 anywhere again and came here.
[187.07] You have decided to get out of here,
[189.83] have you thought about 
where would you go?
[208.43] If you take one more step across this door,
I will bury you alive.
[211.57] For God’s sake, 
let her come in.
[213.63] Get out of here. 
Dad, let me come in,
[215.27] I will tell you, Mom,
it wasn’t my fault.
[217.30] Move back! Move,
[218.23] there is no place for a characterless girl 
like you in this house.
[245.97] Fiza? 
Yes?
[248.03] Don’t you want to get ready 
to go to school?
[251.77] Umm, I was thinking that…
[254.67] Hey,
[256.03] why would she get ready for school?
[258.77] She is not at the age 
to go to school now.
[261.70] Hey, I am not asking her 
to go to school to study,
[264.93] she used to teach in a school.
[267.73] Did you call the school?
[270.27] Umm, no,
[272.10] I don’t have a phone. 
Hmm.
[274.90] So, I was thinking that
[276.40] I will go to meet madam today
[279.63] and will tell her that 
I am joining from tomorrow.
[284.47] You have made an absolutely
 right decision,
[287.30] Sarfaraz will take you to school 
after breakfast, okay?
[291.03] What are you guys talking about?
I didn’t get it.
[295.50] What is there to not understand?
[298.80] Our Fiza used to teach 
at the school before marriage,
[302.63] so, she asked me yesterday that 
she wants to join school again.
[306.20] So, I said, we are not 
the kind of parents-in-law,
[310.27] who would suppress the wishes
of our daughter-in-law
[313.57] or won’t understand her happiness, right?
[316.03] So, I immediately allowed her,
[318.13] I told her, no, my child, 
do whatever you feel like,
[321.07] you have my permission.
[325.20] Right, my child?
[326.10] You want to start working again, right?
[327.97] You want to go to school, 
right? Say it. Say it.
[334.40] Yes, I wanted to join my job again.
[338.67] My child,
[340.27] I thought it would be better 
if you spent more time at home
[346.27] but okay if you wish to go and teach,
[353.40] I wouldn’t refuse.
[355.50] What are you saying about 
spending time at home,
[359.90] once she comes back from the job,
she will spend time at home,
[362.63] where else would she spend time then?
[364.90] Hmm,
[366.80] okay.
[368.17] Whatever makes Fiza happy.
[371.87] Umm, Mr. Sarfaraz,
[374.37] Fiza will join the school from tomorrow,
[377.40] she will get back into a routine,
[379.87] I think you must start earning too, hmm?
[384.53] When we fixed your marriage,
[386.60] we told them our son has 
a business of his own,
[392.23] so I think you must get serious now.
[396.60] Yes,
[398.37] I am serious,
[400.03] I have forwarded my CV to a few places,
[402.30] so, I will get a response from there.
[404.37] My son is very talented.
[406.83] He will prove to be talented 
once he gets a job.
[411.40] Look,
[412.47] there are a lot of people 
who give interviews,
[415.30] but only the talented ones get the job.
[422.53] So, do you have doubts 
about my son’s talent?
[426.57] Do one thing,
[428.20] once Fiza’s school work is done,
[431.03] drop her off and come to the shop.
[434.87] Until you get a job,
[437.50] it would be better if you give 
some time to the shop.
[439.90] Okay?
[446.63] Do you see this?
[448.40] Do you see how is behaving with me?
[451.60] Forget about him,
[453.77] once you get a job, 
he will get quiet himself,
[457.27] and because his bread-earning 
daughter-in-law is in front of him,
[461.37] he will obviously do the comparison.
[464.17] Why are you sitting here and eating?
[466.53] Go get ready.
[469.17] I am not your father’s servant that 
I will stand in the heat there outside.
[472.03] I will eat this later. 
I will quickly go get ready.
[474.57] Go.
[481.07] You guys are not doing right
 with sister-in-law.
[484.60] Now I will hear things from her now.
[486.20] You shut up,
[488.50] his father has already made him angry by 
mocking him about the job early in the morning
[492.60] and you are being fuel to the fire.
[495.97] And we are not committing any sin
by asking her to go for a job, hmm?
[499.90] When they are at their parents’ house
[501.90] and are earning and providing for them,
[504.17] nothing happens to them at that time.
[505.50] As soon as the in-laws ask them
to go do a job,
[508.70] they just die.
[511.10] Hmph!
[513.77] Go check if she is ready,
[516.20] you are getting late. 
I am not going.
[533.23] Greetings, Sir Jr.
[534.73] Greetings.
[536.43] Jaffar, give me the news I am waiting for.
[540.37] Sir, she was Zunaira’s girl.
[544.90] I just want to know about Dua.
[548.60] Sir, we are all very aware of Zunaira’s name 
and the work that she does.
[557.40] Hmm.
[560.17] How did Dua get to Zunaira?
[565.17] You said that… 
Yes, I did.
[568.27] Dua met Zunaira after being
thrown out of his father’s house
[573.87] and Zunaira tried to use her
to her advantage
[578.83] but Dua is still reproaching.
[586.73] Hmm.
[589.97] Fix my meeting with Zunaira.
[592.53] Will you go there?
[596.07] Yes, why? What happened?
[597.77] No, Sir,
[599.33] I mean, that place is not 
according to your standards.
[604.40] I know.
[606.97] But do as I say, Jaffar.
[609.33] Go.
[610.33] Sir, think once again.
[615.80] I have thought it through 
and then decided.
[618.63] If Sir Sr gets to know about this news,
[622.60] you will have to face his anger.
[625.07] Who will tell him?
[631.83] You?
[633.17] No, Sir.
[635.17] Shoot me the day you get 
suspicious about me.
[641.20] Just do what I told you.
[645.10] Okay, Sir,
[646.73] I will do it.
[648.13] Would evening be fine?
[653.97] Hmm.
[658.27] As you say.
[675.63] Sumbul?
[676.47] Sumbul, I will just be back in a while,
[678.60] then I will help you in the kitchen
for lunch once I come back.
[681.60] There is no need to worry 
about the kitchen,
[683.80] I and Mom will take care of it.
[685.53] Mmhmm, I am just going 
to a meeting with Madam,
[688.07] I have to join from tomorrow 
so I will be back soon.
[691.13] You are going out with brother 
for the first time, right?
[693.10] Take your time, there is no need 
to come early.
[700.13] Sorry sister-in-law,
[701.83] do you know, 
brother wasn’t like this,
[704.50] he was very, very nice,
[706.67] he used to laugh, make us laugh,
[708.97] I don’t know what happened to him.
[712.13] When he scolds you,
[714.20] I don’t like it at all.
[716.37] I,
[718.20] I don’t have any complaints 
from your brother.
[722.43] You are very nice, sister-in-law.
[724.40] You too.
[725.97] Now quickly go, 
otherwise you will be late.
[727.47] Yes, yes. Bye, bye. 
Bye.
[738.73] Shall we go?
[742.23] What is this? 
Will you go wearing this?
[745.77] What happened to my appearance?
[748.03] These are my new clothes, 
I took them out yesterday.
[750.03] I am not talking about clothes,
[752.03] I am talking about the veil, 
will you go like this with me?
[754.50] I always wear a veil 
when going out of the house.
[759.67] Your sister used to go.
[766.57] Who said that to you?
[771.23] I also have ears and eyes,
[776.10] I also have people who can tell me.
[779.03] I heard she used to go 
to the university without a veil.
[781.53] They lie,
[783.87] if she had ever left the house 
without a veil,
[786.00] Dad would have killed her.
[787.80] Okay, she was the one with 
a veil who left,
[790.47] now move on in life.
[792.63] I am getting late, shall we go?
[794.80] Why don’t you do one thing?
[796.43] Go by a bus or a rickshaw.
[799.27] I don’t know the routes here,
[801.23] and I don’t even have 
the money for the fare,
[803.83] I don’t have anything.
[805.23] What is this suffering I am stuck into?
[809.37] I am taking you one last time,
[810.60] from tomorrow, 
make arrangements for yourself.
[836.97] Mr. Scholar,
[839.27] you called me? 
Is everything okay?
[840.97] Where are you these days, Mr. Aslam?
[843.63] I haven’t even seen you in the mosque.
[847.27] It is just like this, Mr. Scholar.
[853.40] You have become distant from the mosque
 on purpose because of people, right?
[860.80] Just consider it that, Mr. Scholar.
[864.63] This is not the right thing.
[867.57] What should I do? 
What should I do, Mr. Scholar?
[870.83] People’s heart-rending words, 
sentences, mocking,
[874.43] I am unable to bear them.
[879.57] This is a not permanent solution,
[882.33] people never stop talking.
[885.03] Yeah.
[886.27] So, will you keep on just walking from
the front of the mosque all your life in the wait?
[891.77] Actually, I am very weak, Mr. Scholar,
[895.53] I am unable to bear 
what people are saying.
[900.80] You didn’t let the girl enter the house.
[906.33] When the girl admitted her mistake
and came back home,
[910.50] you shouldn’t have made her 
homeless despite having a home.
[914.00] She got me humiliated 
in the whole city,
[916.63] I have been hiding till now.
[919.67] How should I keep such a child 
in my home?
[924.63] What happened, Mr. Aslam?
[927.27] If you get a wound on the body,
[930.27] you don’t cut it and separate it 
from your body,
[934.47] you are supposed to 
take good care of it.
[939.07] Your forgiveness could have 
fixed Dua’s life and hereafter,
[944.23] but you made the honor of your home,
[948.43] homeless because of the fear 
of the world and people,
[952.80] that was wrong.
[957.20] She is a very disobedient daughter, 
Mr. Scholar,
[960.10] very disobedient.
[961.57] Look, she didn’t care about 
the honor of her ancestors,
[965.63] she crossed the limit of her house.
[967.83] I cannot keep such a daughter at home, no.
[970.33] We are also disobedient to God,
[973.07] day and night,
[975.93] but He, my God,
[978.30] he never closed the doors 
of his blessings on us.
[983.37] We are so cruel, Mr. Aslam,
[985.93] if our children make a mistake,
[988.43] we kill them in the name of honor,
[992.73] we throw them out of the house.
[995.63] My God has opened the gates of forgiveness
till the day of judgment so who are we?
[1002.33] Who are we to close that door?
[1006.43] If possible,
[1008.63] find your daughter and bring her home,
[1011.60] and don’t ruin your honor and your life 
hereafter just for this worldly honor.
[1020.37] What I said,
[1022.03] think about it thoroughly.
[1025.10] Yes, Mr. Scholar, yes.
[1079.17] Fiza, glad to see you.
[1080.97] Thank you, madam.
[1082.20] Literally, I was very worried 
after your marriage
[1085.30] about who should we appoint 
in your place,
[1087.43] because you are one of the best 
teachers in our school.
[1091.63] Thank you so much.
[1093.07] We are fortunate.
[1095.03] Why don’t you join the classes from today?
[1099.67] Once again, thank you, madam.
[1102.27] I will join the classes from tomorrow,
[1104.27] I just came to meet you today 
and to inform you.
[1107.93] As you wish.
[1110.23] Please, allow me to leave.
[1112.13] Okay.
[1168.03] Wow, wow, wow,
[1169.07] you could have taken more time, 
there is no rush.
[1172.33] Did you meet someone inside?
[1174.20] No, it’s not that, 
I just met Samra.
[1177.47] Okay, okay, so you sit with Samra,
I will go home.
[1180.43] No.
[1182.13] Listen I was thinking that 
Mom’s house is nearby,
[1184.73] if we could just meet her on our way,
 she would be happy.
[1188.17] You do one thing,
[1189.47] do this work of making your mom happy 
from tomorrow or the day after,
[1193.03] it cannot be done today.
[1201.87] Now sit. 
Okay.
[1207.97] Greetings.
[1230.50] Is there something that 
you are worried about?
[1233.67] Mr. Scholar called me,
[1235.73] he was asking me why don’t I 
come to the mosque.
[1238.20] So, what did you say then?
[1240.57] What would I say? Tell me.
[1242.57] I just said that people’s words of mocking,
[1247.13] the way they look at me,
[1248.73] I can’t come to the mosque 
because of this.
[1250.93] You closed the doors of 
this house for Dua
[1253.23] just because you were helpless
because of fear of people.
[1257.17] Yes.
[1261.30] For God’s sake,
[1263.87] for God’s sake,
[1265.30] clear your heart for Dua,
[1269.07] forgive her.
[1271.40] I can’t sleep all night thinking 
how our daughter must be.
[1277.77] That is what the Scholar says too.
[1280.00] So then,
[1281.17] will you look for her?
[1285.37] I am saying that Mr. Scholar 
is saying the same.
[1288.33] I didn’t say that I would get up and 
go and look for her right now.
[1300.93] Oh God,
[1303.93] Oh God, protect my daughter,
[1308.97] end her test,
[1311.73] and hand her over 
in safe hands, my God.
[1317.37] It is a request of this sad mother, my God.
[1321.03] Protect my daughter, my God,
[1325.23] protect her.
[1332.83] You are going out with brother 
for the first time, right?
[1334.50] Take your time,
[1335.60] there is no need to come early.
[1339.07] Watch the route properly,
[1341.33] you have to manage commuting from tomorrow,
I won’t come to pick you up every day,
[1345.47] do you understand?
[1355.73] Mr. Ghaznavi,
[1358.30] why did you bother 
to come to my home?
[1362.87] You should have just ordered,
[1364.90] I would have come to you on my knees.
[1370.10] You must have heard the saying,
[1374.27] that the thirsty comes to the well himself.
[1377.70] Wow,
[1379.33] I am honored.
[1380.97] I mean we have become fortunate
[1384.53] that your thirst brought you 
to Zunaira’s home.
[1392.40] Order me,
[1394.77] how should I help you?
[1399.67] Please, will you have something? 
That’s not needed.
[1404.53] I want to meet Dua.
[1410.07] Dua?
[1414.10] Where did you meet Dua?
[1417.47] He was there at brother Qasim’s party.
[1422.57] Dua is that kind of a girl,
[1427.30] our very special guest 
wants to meet her.
[1431.93] Hmm.
[1433.73] It will be better than all of this 
if you can call Dua soon.
[1435.97] Yes, why not?
[1438.27] Rumi,
[1440.40] call Dua.
[1442.67] Tell her, our very special guest 
wants to meet her.
[1447.37] I will call her.
[1451.97] Mr. Ghaznavi,
[1453.80] please have something. 
No, thank you so much.
[1458.00] I just want Dua.
[1461.93] Oh.
[1464.33] Consider you got her.
[1467.37] Since when is Dua here?
[1471.07] It has been a while since 
she has been here.
[1475.83] She used to go to the university
 till a few days ago,
[1482.23] how has it been a while 
since she is here?
[1486.13] Do you know Dua?
[1489.60] Is she an old acquaintance?
[1493.23] That shouldn’t be your concern.
[1505.57] Dua?
[1507.20] Where are you?
Come fast.
[1513.33] Here I am,
[1515.33] wearing your favorite dress.
[1517.80] Good,
[1519.10] now quietly stand here 
and do as I say.
[1523.50] Why are you doing my makeover 
just to take me to the lounge?
[1527.27] Is someone here?
[1529.67] Yes,
[1531.03] someone liked you at the party 
and came here for you.
[1535.90] Who?
[1537.33] I don’t know,
[1538.83] I have never seen him here before.
[1541.23] And his name was very difficult.
[1543.57] What was Zunaira telling?
[1545.50] Anyway, I will do your makeover.
[1549.40] You are doing wrong to me,
[1552.97] you are betraying me. You said
[1555.77] you would get me out of here
[1557.90] but you are doing my makeover 
and presenting me to someone.
[1563.00] What is all this, dua?
[1565.03] Think something else 
instead of doubting me.
[1569.40] Anyway,
[1570.30] I have to do your makeover.
[1572.70] Show it to me.
[1579.93] Say Aaa.
[1593.67] Bashir,
[1595.87] go and see where are they.
[1608.87] So, here is Dua,
[1614.70] who you were desperately waiting for.
[1617.63] Sit down.
[1629.73] In fact, do one thing,
[1631.60] you come and sit next to Mr. Ghaznavi,
[1635.43] he has been desperately waiting 
for you for so long.
[1642.53] I want to talk to her alone.
[1647.67] Will you talk to a girl like this?
Apologize.
[1650.70] Sorry ma’am.
[1667.87] Alone?
[1668.90] Yes, yes, sure, sure, do it.
[1672.23] We will go out.
[1673.47] Not here.
[1676.07] Outside.
[1685.60] Outside? 
Jaffar.
[1688.97] Okay.
[1703.33] I guess this amount will be 
sufficient for a short meeting.
[1706.97] Why not?
[1707.97] Bashir will go along.
[1710.33] He will bring Dua back along, hmm?
[1716.43] Apparently, you don’t think 
I am trustworthy.
[1719.63] Hey, Mr. Ghaznavi,
[1722.27] how can I make such a mistake?
[1727.73] I just said it so you don’t have 
to bother dropping her back.
[1734.33] I won’t be bothered.
[1738.03] Actually, I haven’t yet…
[1748.40] Umm, Dua?
[1751.37] You go and take care of yourself 
and I completely trust Mr. Ghaznavi,
[1759.37] he is famous for keeping 
his promises and words.
[1767.57] Hey, get up.
[1771.33] Go.
[1772.37] Shall we go?
[1815.53] Won’t you say something?
[1818.90] What should I say?
[1822.23] My tongue is kept as a guarantee 
under the cheque given by you.
[1833.80] That little amount was 
compensation to meet you,
[1838.63] I had no trouble at all giving it.
[1846.53] if someone goes far away 
and then comes back,
[1851.00] it’s not a small deal.
[1856.80] I didn’t understand.
[1861.07] Won’t you ask why was I looking for you?
[1865.37] The one who has lost her address,
[1868.73] why would she care about 
anyone else finding anything?
[1873.40] Hmm,
[1875.70] it means, you don’t want to ask about me.
[1883.63] Okay, I will ask
[1887.43] but the condition is that 
you will tell me the truth.
[1893.73] And why would I do that?
[1896.87] Because I am asking you.
[1901.43] Are you threatening me?
[1905.97] Will you be threatened by me?
[1912.60] I haven’t forgotten our first meeting yet.
[1915.83] I might get threatened by you now,
[1921.80] there is a huge difference between 
Dua at that time and Dua now.
[1927.67] But I have been looking for that 
old Dua and got to you.
[1935.27] You got very late.
[1940.10] The time will stop itself
[1944.00] because I found you.
[1954.90] How did you get there and why,
[1958.60] I don’t know that
[1964.93] and I don’t want to know
[1968.87] but if you want to tell me something 
yourself then that’s different.
[1975.30] I trusted an ill-bred,
[1983.53] I don’t have anything more to tell you.
[1990.27] Do you want him to get to 
your knees and apologize?
[1997.00] Just tell me his name
and identity once,
[2001.07] and after that, you can give him 
whatever punishment you want.
[2006.57] No,
[2010.80] I don’t want to have any relationship 
with any memory of my past.
[2015.33] Am I a part of that too?
[2020.00] I don’t know.
[2026.53] Do you want to get out of there?
