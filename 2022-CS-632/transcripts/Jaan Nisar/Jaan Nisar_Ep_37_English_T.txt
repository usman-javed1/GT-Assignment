[28.08] You,
[29.40] won’t you forgive me?
[31.88] You haven't done anything that
you will have to apologize for.
[37.60] No,
[39.52] I have said a lot of nonsensical things.
[56.32] What should I do?
[56.88] Sir’s call is not going through,
[59.40] let me call sir.
[74.64] Hello.
[76.32] Sir, Bano speaking.
[78.04] Tell me.
[79.20] Sir, madam has taken
a lot of sleeping pills.
[83.80] What rubbish?
[90.60] Yes, sir,
[91.44] she looks very critical.
[94.12] Where were you?
[95.28] Sir, I was cooking.
[97.40] She waited for you all day
[99.44] and then got angry
[100.80] and now, sir,
[102.56] do me a favor and come quickly.
[108.00] I am coming.
[109.36] You call the ambulance.
[114.56] Okay, sir.
[196.00] You do one thing, go home,
[200.04] I am here.
[201.64] No, I will stay here.
[225.36] You are going to have dinner with me.
[226.88] Why are you forcing me
[228.04] when I am telling you something?
[229.56] You are considering my wish
to be my stubbornness?
[234.80] So then be it.
[240.36] If you go from here today,
[242.48] I won’t eat anything.
[274.80] Sister-in-law,
I cannot be brave like you,
[277.64] I cannot marry someone
I don’t know as you did.
[283.08] Do you think
[285.08] I don’t see
[286.72] how brother is always
pushing you away?
[290.76] He scolds you over every petty thing,
[293.48] he doesn’t take care of you at all.
[296.40] No, sister-in-law,
[298.44] I cannot marry someone I don’t know
[302.12] and I don’t love.
[349.04] Sarfaraz,
[357.64] Sarfaraz, are you listening to me?
[360.36] I am not deaf, I can hear you.
[363.32] No, that’s not what I was saying.
[367.16] So, then what did you say?
[372.48] Sarfaraz,
[375.00] have you ever thought about our child?
[383.64] Yes, I did
[386.52] and I don’t want to have one.
[390.96] Why?
[391.72] Why are you saying this?
[394.16] Because I don’t want to have it.
[398.96] A child is a blessing from God
[401.72] and the biggest happiness of life.
[403.84] Yes, it definitely is happiness,
[406.44] it definitely is, but for the ones
[408.08] whose marriage is also their happiness
[414.00] but for me, this marriage is a punishment
[422.08] and it is the kind of punishment
[425.24] I am not getting rid of.
[428.20] If you disliked me so much,
[431.44] you could have rejected this proposal.
[438.60] But no,
[441.04] if you disliked me,
[443.76] you would have told me at first sight.
[451.24] But Sarfaraz, you,
[454.04] you were so happy with me,
[457.32] so what happened all of a sudden?
[459.08] Right now, you don’t have so much value
[462.48] that you ask me a question,
[464.08] do you understand?
[469.60] And you want to know about a child.
[471.20] Yes, so I have thought about it,
[474.36] I will have a child but not from you.
[481.76] Child, child, child.
[498.84] Look, I know that
[501.28] you have been
very hurt because of me
[503.20] and I am also regretting
a lot because of that.
[507.84] Your regret won’t fill my empty lap.
[513.72] My baby left this world before
I could even hold him in my hands.
[526.92] Fiza but don’t you worry,
[530.08] I am with you.
[532.68] God will bless us
with another child and
[536.64] this time I promise you that
[539.76] I will take very good care of you.
[573.56] She has been shifted to the room.
[585.44] She is fine now.
[588.00] Doctors have said they will keep
her under observation all night.
[598.88] You can go home if you want,
[601.68] the situation is in control now.
[604.80] No, first let me meet her.
[645.20] Why have you become
the enemy of your life?
[648.64] What should I do with such a life
[652.96] which doesn’t have you in it?
[655.16] Why are you being
stubborn like a child?
[656.84] You can live a good, better life,
[658.84] Farah please grow up.
[661.40] I don’t want such a life
[664.76] where you aren’t there.
[665.92] Please, for God’s sake,
I have moved on,
[671.20] you must forget everything
and move on too, please.
[677.08] Don’t give me such
a big punishment for my mistake,
[682.32] I cannot live without you.
[685.56] You don’t want to be mine, right?
[690.28] Don’t be.
[692.48] Go back to your world
[700.36] but then it shouldn’t matter to you
whether I live or die after that.
[712.00] I know
[715.32] that there is no place
for me in your world.
[723.28] But I cannot allow anyone
[726.88] to come to my house
[729.40] and make me realize that
[731.72] you can never be mine,
[743.40] I wasn’t able to bear it,
[753.08] I couldn’t bear it so I took this step.
[758.60] Who came to your house?
[762.48] Who are you talking about?
[764.12] Your wife,
[767.20] Dua.
[773.08] She has clearly said to me
[779.08] if I didn’t distance myself from you,
[782.08] I don’t know,
[783.44] I don’t know, what she might do to me.
[842.72] Take out all these fears
and frights from your mind
[846.88] because your fate is now
[849.72] connected to Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s fate.
[854.88] I am putting this house in your ownership.
[857.00] What’s the need for it?
[859.72] There is, for sure.
[862.16] At least you won’t have the fear that
[863.88] if I leave you in the future,
where would you go?
[866.68] It means that you have
plans to leave me?
[871.52] Never.
[874.80] I have held this hand forever.
[879.24] I won't ever leave you,
[882.80] trust me and my love as well.
[907.40] I won’t let you live happily married,
[909.60] I will only be at peace after
taking you out of Ghaznavi’s life.
[922.96] The Doctor said that
they will discharge you by morning
[926.84] but you won’t do such
stupidity ever again.
[931.76] I won’t do it if you say so.
[933.40] I am saying it to you.
[935.40] I will try.
[938.12] Bano will stay here with you tonight.
[939.68] You stay,
[943.16] please.
[946.04] If you will stay here my frustration
might stay in control as well,
[951.92] otherwise, I don’t know,
[954.52] I might do something again.
[960.52] Please, for me,
[963.00] just tonight, I promise, please.
[984.64] Okay.
[989.52] Thank you.
[1133.52] What rubbish?
[1134.88] Where were you?
[1136.32] You call the ambulance.
[1177.04] You are alone there while 
Ghaznavi is here with me.
[1180.52] Now, you can guess
[1182.28] who is more important in his life.
[1248.68] Where are you guys coming from?
[1255.60] You and your sir went to
Farah’s house, right?
[1270.16] You won’t say it, right?
[1277.44] Because you are loyal to your sir.
[1301.28] Where were you all night?
[1303.92] Hospital.
[1306.60] Farah took sleeping pills.
[1308.96] Didn’t she die?
[1313.92] I am surprised,
[1315.68] she always survives every time
after multiple suicide attempts.
[1323.40] Why did you go there?
[1326.68] So, she told you?
[1328.80] So, when I told you there
is nothing between us,
[1336.68] why do you want to prove me
wrong by doubting me?
[1338.88] Why don’t you get it?
[1340.32] I am trying to prove you wrong
[1343.28] or are you denying what you said?
[1345.20] I am denying?
[1346.12] Yes, you are.
[1347.16] You said it in front of
Baba Saaein and Amma Saeein
[1349.64] that you have no place
for her in your heart
[1351.80] so then why,
[1352.92] why do you go running to her
when she calls you once?
[1360.60] Tell me.
[1362.36] Do you have an answer?
[1363.96] On humanitarian grounds.
[1365.68] She could have died.
[1366.80] But she didn’t die.
[1367.96] Okay, enough!
[1375.20] You won’t keep any terms with her,
[1376.80] you won’t go there.
[1377.76] I will be in terms with her,
[1379.44] till you have some connection with her,
[1380.96] I will stay in terms with her.
[1386.76] And,
[1387.28] and why shouldn’t I talk to her?
[1389.28] She can destroy my home
[1391.20] and I will just watch in
the corner as a silent spectator?
[1394.04] Your home is not that weak, Dua,
[1396.40] that it can break if anyone tries a little.
[1400.52] You were with her all night,
[1407.04] you were attending to her,
[1411.00] the home is already broken.
[1424.48] I am sad to know that
your belief is so weak.
[1431.28] I felt sad too,
[1434.24] knowing that you denied your words.
[1485.24] Sumbul,
[1487.00] I am, I am very scared.
[1491.76] Sister-in-law,
[1492.72] what will happen to me if you are scared?
[1495.88] How we are going to meet Khizer,
[1499.36] if your brother finds out,
[1500.60] I swear to God, he will kill me.
[1502.88] How will brother know?
[1504.44] He is at the office, right?
[1505.84] And we will come early before he returns.
[1508.52] I don’t know why
[1510.64] I feel that what we are
doing is not right, Sumbul.
[1515.56] Sister-in-law, you, just once,
[1518.28] just once try talking to Khizer,
[1520.64] if he doesn’t seem sincere to you,
[1523.64] I will quietly marry Fahad.
[1525.96] But please, at least meet him once.
[1529.84] What you have said has convinced me.
[1536.88] Now that I have agreed to go along,
[1541.56] I cannot back out.
[1543.48] Thank God, let’s go now.
[1545.48] Okay, let’s go.
[1546.20] Let’s go.
[1546.80] One second, let me take my bag.
[1551.12] Let’s go now, you’re ready!
[1562.92] Where are you both going?
[1564.32] And you,
[1565.32] you just came back from school
[1567.36] and you are ready to
go out again? Yeah?
[1569.52] Don’t you feel like staying home?
[1572.48] Umm,
[1573.16] we are going to the market,
[1574.08] market,
[1574.88] we had to buy some stuff,
[1575.84] I told you, right?
[1576.88] You did tell me, you did tell me
[1578.80] but you didn’t tell me
you will go in this heat,
[1581.76] you can go in the evening.
[1582.96] The evening will be very late
[1584.72] if we go in the evening,
it will take us very long in the market,
[1587.24] it will be night by then
and it will get dark,
[1589.16] Dad will be home and
brother will be home too,
[1591.92] and you know brother’s nature,
[1593.72] he will dig into the depths of it and
[1595.48] he will scold us too,
[1596.76] so that is why I thought
[1598.04] if we go right now,
we will be back by the evening,
[1599.60] right?
[1600.08] Let’s go, sister-in-law.
[1600.72] Okay go,
[1601.76] but come back soon
[1603.44] and you.
[1604.68] Yes?
[1605.56] Don’t make her wander
around the market a lot,
[1607.08] do you understand?
[1607.96] Mom?
[1609.08] Sister-in-law is not taking me,
[1610.68] I am taking sister-in-law.
[1615.12] Aren’t you getting late now?
[1617.68] Yes, we are leaving.
[1619.12] Let’s go, sister-in-law.
[1622.04] Bye.
[1622.92] Bye.
[1626.96] Defending her sister-in-law.
[1640.36] How are you feeling now?
[1642.64] I am feeling good now
that you are here.
[1647.72] Okay, you have to take
care of yourself now,
[1650.28] and one more thing,
[1652.84] if you make such
a mistake ever again,
[1656.16] I won’t ever come to meet you.
[1660.48] When you are close to me,
[1662.60] I start loving my life.
[1667.88] Did you take your medicine?
[1671.32] No.
[1673.48] I am sure you didn’t
have lunch either, right?
[1676.40] I was waiting for you.
[1679.28] You will get unwell again if you
don’t take care of yourself,
[1682.04] please.
[1684.92] Everything gets fine
when you are close to me,
[1688.68] when you leave,
[1690.12] everything starts going wrong.
[1693.32] I will ask Bano to serve food to you.
[1695.68] You must have had lunch with Dua.
[1704.48] No, I am coming here directly from the office.
[1709.20] Yeah, so okay then,
[1710.52] I'll get the lunch laid for both of us.
[1733.12] You didn’t come yesterday, sister?
[1735.80] Yes,
[1736.68] because Amma Saeein and
Baba Saeein were here, that’s why.
[1739.60] Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein?
[1744.64] His parents.
[1746.04] Oh okay.
[1748.56] That’s what I was saying too that
[1750.04] she must have been
occupied with something,
[1752.16] that is why she didn’t come.
[1754.32] So, tell me,
[1755.48] how are they?
[1756.68] Are they nice to you?
[1761.12] They are very nice to me,
[1762.52] takes very good care of me
[1764.00] and loves me a lot.
[1766.16] Look they gave me these
bangles as a wedding gift.
[1769.60] Sister, they look so beautiful.
[1771.96] Really,
[1772.84] okay then, take this
[1773.72] and try wearing them.
[1774.32] Hey no,
[1775.12] your mother-in-law has
given them to you,
[1777.04] don’t wear them.
[1777.80] So what?
[1779.20] She will fulfill her wish.
[1785.24] They look much nicer in your hands.
[1788.80] They are very beautiful.
[1791.24] Sania, my child,
[1793.16] Sania?
[1794.52] Yes, Dad?
[1797.68] Yes, my child,
[1798.92] take this,
[1800.16] these are snacks, piping hot snacks,
[1803.68] feed them,
[1805.04] feed them to Dua.
[1805.88] Ok
[1809.32] Dad still doesn’t know how to show
off his love to his daughters.
[1813.76] No problem,
[1815.36] at least he has started to realize.
[1818.36] All this will get cold while talking.
[1820.32] Take this out as well and
[1821.36] make tea along with it for us.
Okay.
[1825.52] Are you happy?
[1829.80] Very happy.
[1833.00] Okay,
[1835.20] your mother-in-law
met you for the first time,
[1837.60] I mean,
[1838.56] this wedding gift,
[1840.80] didn’t she give it earlier?
[1842.88] No,
[1843.24] she met me for the first time.
[1845.04] Why?
[1846.88] Weren’t they ready for your
and Nosherwan’s marriage?
[1851.92] No,
[1853.40] they weren’t earlier but
[1856.28] then now thank God everything is well.
[1860.44] Mom,
[1863.40] don’t worry yourself
by getting into all this.
[1869.04] They are very nice,
they take very good care of me,
[1873.64] they love me a lot
[1876.20] and I am very happy.
[1878.52] Hmm?
[1879.52] Yes.
[1896.88] Where is Khizer?
[1898.52] I don’t know,
[1899.64] he was saying
[1900.44] I am just five minutes away, 
on my way.
[1904.76] See, we might be late.
[1909.64] Even the messages
aren’t getting delivered now.
[1912.08] I guess there are signal issues here.
[1913.32] Sister-in-law, shall I go out and talk?
[1915.56] Yes, go quickly.
[1934.52] Greetings.
[1937.16] Greetings.
[1939.28] I am sure you must be sister-in-law Fiza.
[1942.92] Yes.
[1945.56] The way Sumbul has introduced you,
[1947.08] I can’t make any mistake in recognizing you.
[1950.16] Can I sit here if you allow it?
[1951.64] Yes, yes, why not? Sit.
[1957.04] Sister-in-law, Sumbul?
[1958.00] She just went out to call you,
[1960.24] there were some signal issues here.
[1963.48] Actually, sister-in-law,
I barely get any time while I am on duty,
[1966.68] I came because you called me,
[1968.36] sorry,
[1969.20] Sumbul wanted me to meet you.
[1970.88] Hey, where have you brought me?
[1972.88] Prawn karahi is amazing here,
[1975.24] you just try it,
[1976.60] and you will praise it then.
[1978.00] Let’s see how your prawn karahi is.
[1980.08] Come.
[1980.92] I do have an idea why Sumbul
wants me to meet you.
[1988.60] She must have told you,
[1990.76] there is a proposal being considered for her.
[1994.88] Her wedding is being fixed,
[1998.76] just consider it has been already fixed.
[2006.92] Yes, she told me.
[2009.52] So, won’t you take a stand?
