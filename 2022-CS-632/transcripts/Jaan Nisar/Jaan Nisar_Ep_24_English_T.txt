[24.24] Yes, doctor, is everything fine?
[26.40] Everything is not fine, in fact,
there is good news for you people.
[35.80] Good news?
[37.12] Yes, you will soon have a 
new member added to your family.
[41.16] You will have to take 
really good care of her.
[44.32] She is really weak.
[45.88] I am prescribing some medication.
[47.84] Start taking them soon,
 in fact, start them today.
[53.32] Fiza, you will have to take 
a lot of care of yourself.
[56.76] Sure.
[64.28] Doctor, we don’t want this child.
[70.32] Sorry?
[71.60] What did you say? 
I didn’t understand.
[75.60] That,
[77.48] we don’t need this child.
[79.16] What are you saying?
[86.80] What are you trying to say?
[88.88] How many children do you have?
[92.76] This is our first child.
[94.08] This is the first one?
[95.84] Do you want to finish your 
first happiness like this?
[101.12] Can I know the reason?
[103.96] This is our personal reason, please.
[106.12] You want me to help you and 
still this is your personal matter?
[111.68] What is this?
[113.16] Anyway, I don’t want to argue with you.
[116.08] Firstly, I will not help you with this matter
[120.80] and I will surely say that a mother 
wants to bring up a child,
[125.20] and this becomes a crime when 
the mother wants to give birth to the child.
[130.44] I can complain about you to 
the police right now, right this moment
[134.04] and they will arrest you right now.
[137.12] Please. Please. 
You don’t do this.
[140.88] It is a misunderstanding, 
we will talk about it.
[144.64] You can leave.
[149.52] Take care of yourself.
[164.44] Hey,
[166.96] these people have been gone for so long, 
they are still not back.
[170.44] I will call Sarfaraz.
[173.36] You are never at peace.
[176.00] Today was the first day of his job.
[178.84] When he came home, 
you didn’t even let him breathe,
[181.32] and you told him to 
take Fiza to the hospital.
[183.56] Hey, so she is his responsibility,
[186.08] I will ask him.
[187.60] So, he is fulfilling his responsibility. 
How else does it fulfill it?
[190.96] You just let it be.
[210.52] Dua.
[216.96] What lottery did you win that 
you became rich all of a sudden?
[224.36] You.
[225.40] Yes, me.
[226.80] Did you recognize me?
[228.76] I thought you would 
refuse to recognize me.
[233.92] We were friends.
[236.48] Even if not for you,
[238.64] I still have respect in my eyes.
[241.16] No.
[242.68] I can see that.
[245.08] These expensive cars, this protocol.
[248.96] Wow.
[252.12] Do you have a problem?
Yes, I surely do.
[258.60] Rida, what did you think?
[261.68] If you don’t give me a place in your home
[265.48] then I will become the dust of the road.
[267.44] No.
[269.20] I had an idea of the charm of your beauty.
[273.24] A girl who disgraces her parents' honor
[276.12] and runs away from home,
[277.80] and then progresses so quickly,
[280.52] how could she be the dust of the road, huh?
[282.72] By the way, it was Faraz 
you ran away with, right?
[286.40] Or was it someone else?
[288.52] Mind what you say.
[290.12] You couldn’t mind your character
[292.72] and I should mind what I say?
[295.16] You are falling really low, Rida.
[299.84] Stop worrying about me,
[302.16] what will you say about yourself, huh?
[304.84] Even your own blood doesn’t 
accept girls like you.
[308.76] Did you forget
[310.24] how your father closed 
the door on your face?
[313.52] Huh?
[315.40] Hey, I remembered,
[317.08] I met your sister Fiza a few days back.
[320.00] The poor thing was pleading a lot to me.
[323.40] She was telling me to 
give her your address.
[327.08] But I told her clearly,
[329.20] that I don’t keep any contact 
with girls like you.
[332.64] Listen to me.
[336.00] If you say another word,
[338.24] then I will ask them and 
have you thrown so far,
[342.16] that when you see me,
[344.20] you will change your direction, yourself.
[347.44] Don't act so arrogant.
[349.68] What if when the things you're flying high on
[353.20] are snatched from you and you fall flat 
on your face just as hard?
[385.48] You had gone to the doctor, right?
[387.84] What did the doctor say to Fiza
 that she is constantly crying?
[394.08] Why are you sitting quietly? 
Will you answer us?
[398.92] There is good news for you people.
[403.56] You people will be grandparents soon.
[406.00] Huh?
[408.04] Hey, this is good news,
[411.92] then why is Fiza crying?
[417.60] Because I don’t want a child.
[422.76] You don’t want a child?
[425.04] What do you mean 
you don’t want a child?
[428.36] I will sort out this matter really soon, 
you will see.
[435.12] Hey,
[437.16] do you hear the nonsense 
he is speaking?
[439.80] What is the nonsense in this?
[442.52] Hey, I don’t want a child right now, 
so I don’t want a child.
[446.08] What is this questioning, this... 
what is going on?
[448.72] What is the need for all this?
[450.48] Why is there no need?
[452.00] Neither are you an orphan nor is Fiza.
[455.28] She also comes from a happy, 
settled home.
[457.44] And then why don't you want 
to become a father?
[460.40] Because I feel that I cannot 
bring up a child right now.
[464.00] I don’t want to get into this hassle.
[468.60] Do you hear the nonsense 
your son is speaking?
[471.52] This is my decision.
[473.40] Talk to me, why are you saying this to her?
[475.48] I should talk to you.
[477.08] I should talk to you. Are you even 
worthy of being spoken to?
[480.88] What is wrong with you two? 
Talk calmly.
[483.68] I should talk calmly.
[485.32] I talk to him calmly.
[487.44] Hey, do you hear the shamelessness 
he is talking in front of his parents
[491.36] and you are advising me to talk calmly?
[495.28] What unique thing did I say in this?
[498.20] I feel really sorry for you.
[501.60] Really sorry.
[503.96] You should be ashamed.
[506.24] Hey, why are worried about me
 having children?
[508.40] They will happen when 
they are meant to happen.
[511.00] But right now, I don't think my circumstances
 are such that I can raise a child.
[515.24] Who are you and I to raise children?
[518.84] It is God who raises them.
[520.88] He will take care of them.
[522.84] Alright, if you don't want 
to raise them then don't.
[525.88] Just like I'm providing for you at home,
[528.56] I'll feed your children and 
my daughter-in-law as well.
[534.52] But, what you want will not happen.
[538.52] Mama, look, make Papa understand 
not to interfere in my matters.
[541.28] Your matters?
[543.04] Your matters?
[544.56] Yes, my matters.
[546.52] Fine.
[547.56] If these are your matters, 
then this is my home.
[551.44] Do you understand?
[552.60] And there is no place for 
a child like you in this home.
[555.28] Get out of here.
[556.56] What…
[557.36] What are you two doing?
[559.16] You are fighting with each other. 
Do you see?
[561.44] You were the one who wanted
 to get him married.
[564.44] You should have let him 
prove himself first,
[567.12] stand on his own two feet.
[569.32] But no, you were in a hurry.
[571.32] Now see the result.
[573.24] The mister doesn’t want his child…
No, no, he will not do anything like this.
[578.24] Sarfaraz, you go right now.
[580.12] Come when his anger cools down. Go.
[583.48] Hey, there is no need 
for him to come back.
[586.32] He should leave from here.
[587.48] We will take care of our daughter-in-law
and her future child.
[591.32] Get lost.
[592.40] You can take care of them if you want,
[594.76] but don’t expect anything from me.
[598.12] Rude, irresponsible, unworthy.
[603.32] Hey, he has lost his mind.
[605.40] What has happened to you?
[606.92] He is naïve.
[608.32] Why are you raising your blood pressure?
[610.12] Sumbul. Sumbul.
[611.84] Bring water for your father.
[613.36] Hey, there is no need. I am fine.
[616.00] You go and check on that girl, 
she is overwhelmed by crying.
[646.12] Madam.
[649.52] Yes, keep this over there.
[660.52] I met your sister Fiza a few days back.
[663.56] The poor thing was pleading a lot to me.
[666.88] She was telling me 
to give her your address.
[669.88] But I told her clearly,
[672.08] that I don’t keep any contact 
with girls like you.
[696.24] If you take another step 
inside this home,
[698.24] then I will bury you alive.
[699.80] For the sake of God, 
let her come inside.
[701.52] Go away from here. 
Papa, come inside. Papa,
[703.08] I will tell you. Papa, it is not my fault. 
Move. Leave.
[706.12] There is no place for a bad 
character girl like you in this home.
[709.08] Papa…
Move away.
[710.20] Move back. Get lost.
[726.76] Are you done with your shopping?
[736.40] What happened?
[739.84] Nothing.
[741.84] Why do you have teary eyes?
[744.48] No.
[746.96] Look at me.
[753.20] The guards were telling me that 
some girl tried to misbehave with you.
[758.92] Who was she?
[761.24] And why did you let her leave like this?
[768.44] It was Rida.
[770.52] My university friend.
[772.68] University friend?
[776.24] Is this the same girl
[778.20] who was with you when we met 
for the first time?
[781.40] Yes.
[784.08] So, why did she misbehave with you?
[793.68] In distress, I had gone to 
seek shelter under her roof.
[799.08] She had refused and ended 
our friendship then.
[808.08] Today,
[810.48] when she saw me in good condition,
she couldn't resist.
[815.24] She had thought that
[818.24] I wouldn't even exist anymore.
[821.36] You don’t need to cry 
for such lowlifes, you know.
[825.96] Yes.
[832.88] She was telling me
[836.68] that Fiza was asking about me.
[842.08] Fiza, who?
[846.88] My sister.
[851.32] Do you miss your own?
[857.68] When do you forget your own?
[864.92] Come on.
[866.44] I will take you to meet them.
[869.12] No.
[873.28] It's better to meet them rather than sitting
alone and crying thinking about them like this.
[877.12] Let's go.
No.
[882.80] I cannot meet them.
[884.84] Why can you not meet them?
[891.96] I…
[894.28] I'm not worthy of them.
[898.08] I'm very bad.
[900.56] Don’t hurt yourself by saying these things.
[902.40] There is nothing like that.
[905.16] Hurt?
[913.08] This is your greatness
[916.88] that you consider me to be good
[923.04] or else,
[925.40] my own…
[931.56] Do you feel like crying?
[941.40] Then, cry.
[944.84] The burden on your heart will be reduced.
[985.40] Sister-in-law.
[992.20] Drink water.
[999.72] You will get unwell further like this.
[1003.52] I am fine.
[1005.24] You are not fine.
[1007.20] You are making me an aunt.
[1009.48] You know
[1011.00] how happy this news has made me.
[1013.36] But your brother is not happy. He…
[1015.64] Brother is wrong.
[1017.36] Whatever he said was really wrong.
[1019.72] None of us will support him.
[1021.80] Papa has scolded him a lot.
[1028.16] Did your heart find peace?
[1030.16] Are you happy making 
the father-son fight?
[1032.44] Mama…
[1034.00] What, mama?
[1035.60] How long has she been in this home?
[1038.00] And as soon as they arrived, 
she caused trouble.
[1040.16] She made the father and son fight.
[1042.00] It is Brother’s fault.
[1043.36] Why are you saying things 
to sister-in-law?
[1044.96] You be quiet. And you.
[1047.88] Why were you in such a hurry?
[1049.32] Why were you in such a hurry? Tell me.
[1052.48] It has not even been a few days 
since you started going to school.
[1055.56] You didn’t bring the first salary
[1058.00] and you started preparing
 for new expenses?
[1060.40] My son was right,
[1062.80] he cannot afford it right now,
[1064.48] he just started a new job,
[1066.12] and if you too use the child as 
an excuse and sit at home,
[1069.76] then where will the salary come from? 
How will we manage the expenses of the home?
[1072.24] What are you saying? 
What if father hears you, then?
[1074.16] Let him hear me.
[1075.80] When does he know 
how the world operates?
[1079.72] And you?
[1081.08] He dragged my son out of the home 
because of you.
[1084.68] Those two have fought because of you.
[1087.04] If my son doesn’t come back
 safe and sound,
[1090.20] then you will see what I do with you.
[1103.44] You please don’t take what Mama 
and Brother say to your heart.
[1109.72] Should I bring something to eat?
[1166.92] There is no greater intoxication like it 
in the world, than the intoxication of wealth.
[1190.28] Hello.
[1191.36] I was waiting for your call.
[1194.64] Did you get the price?
[1197.04] I got it.
[1198.52] Then, till when will the work be done?
[1201.12] Hey, you sent the money today.
[1206.12] We have already started your work.
[1209.44] I have thrown the first pebble from
 the past in Dua’s peaceful life.
[1217.04] I didn’t give you such a big amount 
to throw pebbles.
[1220.88] I want the work done in days, 
in fact, hours. Fast.
[1224.92] It will be done.
[1227.84] Why do you worry?
[1229.88] When Zunaira gave you her word
[1232.76] that I would take out Dua 
from Ghaznavi’s life,
[1240.52] then relax.
[1242.52] You don’t worry about me relaxing,
[1244.92] and focus on the work.
[1259.68] Pride ends with those who have money.
[1265.36] Everything is available 
to these damned people.
[1269.72] If they don’t have anything,
[1274.68] it is the nearness to their husbands.
[1278.52] And to get them,
[1281.40] they need people like us.
[1308.64] Who was madam talking to about 
taking Dua out of Nosherwan’s life?
[1314.40] I should inform Dua.
[1328.28] Rumi, Shariq has come outside, 
he is calling you immediately.
[1331.08] You go, I will come.
[1332.08] Come quickly, okay?
[1333.32] Hmmm.
[1346.00] Mr. Nazeer told him 
to leave the house, so easily.
[1350.44] I don't know where my child has gone, 
right now. What would he be doing?
[1355.68] Mama, remain calm. 
You spoke to brother.
[1358.24] He is saying he will come back,
so remain calm.
[1361.04] So, don’t I understand his tone?
[1364.04] He didn’t leave to come back.
[1366.00] God knows where my son would be.
[1369.56] With this girl's arrival, 
my child has become homeless.
[1373.80] If something happens to my son,
[1376.36] then I will not leave anyone.
[1393.60] Oh, I'm afraid
[1396.12] my child might do something wrong.
[1398.48] Oh dear,
[1400.04] he is my entire life's savings. 
What will I do?
[1404.00] No. He won't. 
He won't do anything wrong.
[1406.76] You pray to God for betterment, Mama.
[1408.68] Everything will be fine.
[1410.60] Hey, the betterment left my home the moment 
this girl got married and came here.
[1415.04] God knows what sort of people 
we are stuck with.
[1422.08] Hey, I am tired of standing, call him.
[1425.88] God knows where he would be.
[1434.80] Mama.
[1437.28] Oh my child,
[1438.88] you are here.
[1440.52] You didn’t care about 
your mother even a little, right?
[1445.76] Mama, I cared for you 
that’s why I came back
[1449.12] or else I didn’t want to come back.
[1452.52] If something had happened to me,
then you would have really regretted it.
[1455.12] Okay stop it. Stop crying.
[1457.24] Thank God, Brother, 
you have come back.
[1458.56] Come on.
[1511.56] Do you miss your own?
[1514.04] When do you forget your own?
[1516.08] It's better to meet them rather than sitting 
alone and crying thinking about them like this.
[1519.88] Let's go.
No.
[1525.52] I cannot meet them.
[1527.52] Why can you not meet them?
[1529.44] I…
[1531.64] I'm not worthy of them.
[1535.44] I'm very bad.
[1537.96] Don’t hurt yourself by saying these things.
[1539.84] There is nothing like that.
[1542.48] Hurt?
[1550.52] This is your greatness
[1554.24] that you consider me to be good.
[1581.72] How long has she been in this home?
[1584.28] And as soon as they arrived, 
she caused trouble.
[1586.44] She made the father and son fight.
[1588.16] It is Brother’s fault.
[1589.56] Why are you saying things 
to sister-in-law?
[1591.16] You be quiet. And you.
[1594.12] Why were you in such a hurry?
[1595.56] Why were you in such a hurry? 
Tell me.
[1598.60] It has not even been a few days 
since you started going to school.
[1601.76] You didn’t bring the first salary
[1604.20] and you started preparing 
for new expenses?
[1617.04] Did you find peace making me homeless?
[1619.96] You are back.
[1621.44] What?
[1622.64] What did you want that 
I don’t come back? Huh?
[1625.00] I never wanted that.
[1626.72] Had you listened to me at that time,
[1629.60] then this scene wouldn’t have 
been created at home.
[1632.96] You are still insisting that I listen to you?
[1637.76] Yes.
[1641.32] Sarfaraz, he is our first child,
[1645.40] our firstborn.
[1648.64] People go crazy with happiness 
for their firstborn and you, here…
[1652.04] I don’t want this happiness.
[1661.04] What are you staring at?
[1664.40] I don’t want this happiness.
[1697.68] Thank God your mood is fine.
[1700.80] I got scared seeing your condition yesterday.
[1703.88] You were even sighing in your sleep.
[1707.36] How can anyone stay sad for long, 
with a life partner like you?
[1711.32] You shouldn’t remain sad, either.
[1713.28] Why?
[1718.32] It doesn’t suit you.
[1723.88] Fine.
[1725.96] I will try that you don’t see me sad 
in the future.
[1728.24] There is no compulsion.
[1731.72] If you are ever sad or 
if you feel like crying,
[1735.28] my shoulder will be available.
[1738.80] I don’t want any pain to make 
a place in your heart.
[1744.44] I know.
[1746.80] This one thought has kept me together,
[1751.64] that I am in really safe hands.
[1754.84] May God keep this trust of yours intact.
[1758.36] Amen.
[1760.52] Okay, tell me,
[1762.52] do you have a plan for tonight?
[1765.04] No, nothing special.
[1766.72] Do you want to go somewhere?
[1769.56] You have a plan daily,
[1771.76] so I thought I would ask myself today.
[1774.84] No, it won't be possible today.
[1778.64] Any special engagement?
[1782.44] Yes, I have to go to the mansion.
[1785.80] Baba Saaein is not well,
[1787.08] he has especially sent me a message
and asked me to come.
[1789.96] Oh okay.
[1791.20] No, no, there is no issue, 
you go ahead.
[1793.68] We anyway go for an outing, daily.
[1796.28] You go comfortable.
[1798.64] I will be back by night.
[1801.44] Don’t worry, there are people 
here to protect you.
[1804.32] if you want to go out somewhere, 
then take the guards and driver.
[1808.40] Sure.
[1810.32] Listen,
[1817.28] is…
[1820.00] is it possible for me to come along 
to the mansion with you
[1827.44] to meet Amma and Baba Saaein?
[1832.40] No, it won't be possible right now.
[1838.48] Look, I don’t want you to tolerate 
anything, anyone says.
[1846.64] When the time comes I will take you myself,
to meet everyone.
[1850.28] Okay?
[1852.68] Sure.
[1855.68] I will stay in touch.
[1857.56] Safe travel. 
Go relaxed.
[1860.92] You take care of yourself.
[1869.00] Okay, listen, 
I will be out of reach.
[1871.28] Postpone all meetings till tomorrow.
[1873.04] Okay.
[1881.68] What did you see that 
you turned to stone?
[1887.00] These bosses have an amazing life.
[1892.40] They come to the office
 when they want,
[1895.32] when they want, they leave.
[1897.20] They are the boss, after all. 
Yes,
[1900.64] but I have not been 
introduced to him till now.
[1902.56] Hey, my brother, 
how long have you been here for?
[1905.40] You have not been here for long, 
and you are longing to be introduced.
[1909.88] It took me two years to talk to him,
[1913.20] and even then we only spoke for one minute.
[1916.16] Till today, I am living in the happiness 
of that one minute.
[1919.60] What do you mean?
[1920.24] Does he not give importance to his staff?
[1922.40] Boss only gives importance to the work.
[1925.28] If you want to get noticed by boss,
[1927.36] then do something that he notices it.
[1929.80] or else continue 9 to 5 like us.
[1932.32] Hey, a lot of people retired 
without being noticed.
[1936.00] And some went home.
[1937.72] This means he is a difficult man.
[1939.24] Extremely difficult.
[1941.08] Hmm.
[1942.24] But should I tell you something?
[1944.76] Every person has a weakness, 
he too must it.
[1948.48] Why not?
[1951.60] The girl he married recently 
is his weakness.
[1956.68] The place where he got the wife from,
[1958.88] people can say a lot if they want to,
[1960.96] but no one has the courage.
[1962.48] Where did he bring his wife from?
[1964.24] Leave it, why do we care?
[1967.00] Will you people just talk 
or will you also work?
[1970.00] Yes, we are working. 
I will come. Okay?
[1975.76] You are new.
[1977.56] Try that you only work here.
[1980.24] Sure.
[1986.88] I will have to find out who he married.
[1999.48] Hello.
[2000.60] Hello, Rumi, how are you?
[2003.40] Leave me, you tell me, are you fine?
[2006.04] Thank God.
[2007.92] You sound worried, is everything okay?
[2010.36] Man, I am really worried.
[2012.80] Thank God I got through on your number.
[2014.88] I was worried all night long about 
whether I would be able to talk to you or not.
[2019.40] Why the emergency? Is everything okay?
[2023.08] Everything is fine in this ordeal.
[2024.92] Anyway, you answer me.
[2028.24] Yes, yes, go ahead.
[2029.92] Did Zunaira contact you?
[2034.40] Yes.
[2035.96] When?
[2037.44] A few days back.
[2039.60] What was she saying?
[2041.36] The same that is in her nature, 
what else?
[2044.16] Did you talk to Nosherwan about this?
[2047.28] No,
[2049.68] I don’t think so. 
I didn’t tell him anything.
[2054.32] I don’t find it to be right.
[2055.80] Then, I don’t take what Zunaira says 
seriously, either.
[2060.08] Man, Dua, this negligence of yours can 
become a big problem for you one day.
[2065.40] What do you mean?
[2066.72] Meaning, Zunaira was talking to someone 
on a call about bringing you back here.
