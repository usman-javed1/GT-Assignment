[22.43] Come, let’s sit here.
[25.27] Umm, no, let’s sit outside.
[28.83] Hey, why would you sit outside?
[31.87] I have to give you a surprise.
[33.77] Sit inside, come.
[36.00] And this is not my room,
[39.37] this is our room.
[43.53] Come.
[55.20] Sit down, I will be right back.
[63.50] Why are you closing the door?
[66.40] You do understand 
the meaning of surprise, right?
[68.43] I want to give you a surprise,
[69.80] that’s why I am closing it.
[71.63] Look, Mom will come,
[72.80] she will suddenly open the door
[74.23] and you will be sitting here,
[76.03] she will like it, right?
[79.07] You just sit and relax,
[80.37] I will be right back, okay?
[104.73] Fehmida?
[106.77] Fehmida?
[107.60] Yes, yes, I am coming.
[109.67] Are the girls back from the salon?
[112.67] They will come, they just went,
[114.27] it takes time to get ready.
[115.97] I asked you not to send them,
[117.60] but you guys are
 so obsessed with fashion,
[119.60] do you even listen to anyone?
[121.20] Why do you worry?
[123.10] They just went nearby,
[124.20] they will be back.
[125.00] They won’t come soon,
[127.03] I know these salon girls,
[129.47] they will make
 them sit there for 4 hours
[131.07] so they can hog money from them,
[132.67] if they don’t come back in time,
[134.40] I will be the worst!
[137.20] I will be the worst!
[143.40] Oh God,
[145.27] oh God, I just hope
 girls come back in time
[147.70] else there will be a huge scene.
[149.60] What was I doing?
[161.57] If I get too late,
[162.53] Dad will scold me a lot.
[164.73] I'll get a serious scolding.
[210.43] Take something out of it.
[211.67] Wear this,
[212.70] it will look nice on you.
[214.37] This will look better with the dress.
[218.00] Yellow looks nice with yellow only.
[219.87] Hey Sumbul, where is your brother?
[221.97] Dad, brother is at the salon.
[223.87] What do you mean by 
he is still at the salon?
[225.27] Have you seen the time?
[226.80] When will he come home,
[228.10] dress up as the groom
[228.80] and when will we leave?
[230.13] He has been gone for a while now,
[231.73] he will be back anytime.
[232.93] What do you mean by
 he will be back anytime?
[234.37] Brother Aslam will get very upset 
if the groom and family arrive late.
[237.57] Hey, what’s there to be upset about?
[239.43] Delays do happen during the weddings.
[241.57] What do you mean by delays do happen?
[243.80] I will send someone to bring him,
[246.47] in fact,
[247.30] do one thing, call him
[248.93] and ask him to immediately come home.
[250.37] Yes, yes, Dad, I…
[251.33] Silly boy.
[252.33] Quickly give me the stopper.
[254.27] Where is my phone?
[255.63] I will just call him.
[256.60] Okay fine.
[258.50] Wear this, this is not going through.
[259.57] Do one thing,
[260.27] wear the other one as well,
[261.13] show me.
[340.70] Oh, it’s you, I got scared.
[344.00] What’s there to be scared about?
[347.50] I don’t see your mother and sister.
[350.47] I told Mom,
[352.80] I have told her that 
my friends are coming,
[355.37] she will be here in a bit.
[357.73] You come here and sit.
[359.87] Okay.
[362.87] Come.
[378.70] This color looks very nice on you
[383.43] and wear the same 
color on our wedding day.
[392.10] Faraz, I am getting very late,
[395.90] I have to get home before
 the groom and family arrive.
[398.53] Hey, I know that,
[401.40] meet mom and have juice
[402.67] then we will leave.
[403.83] This is not needed.
[405.77] Dua?
[406.87] You have come to my,
 not my home
[408.87] but our home for the first time
[412.60] and you know what
 Mom was saying?
[414.33] She was saying that
[415.10] let your friend go 
after having dinner.
[416.60] No, no, this is enough.
[419.57] Yes. You have it.
[435.30] What are you thinking?
[439.03] Nothing,
[440.47] I was just thinking
[446.40] I wish it was our wedding today.
[453.20] You look so beautiful,
[455.47] I can’t even tell you.
[456.67] Please, ask Aunt to come soon
[459.43] then we will leave.
[461.47] Yes, I will ask her, I will.
[464.20] Finish it, come on, come on.
[471.20] That’s it.
[480.70] What happened, Dua?
[482.03] Is everything okay?
[485.27] I feel,
[489.73] I feel dizzy.
[492.40] Okay, okay, then you rest, lie down.
[498.73] I have to go home and…
[512.40] Dua?
[514.07] Faraz?
[539.87] Boys like us only get 
married by our parents’ choice,
[544.37] we just befriend girls
 like you to have a good time,
[551.37] I did love you though
 only for some time.
[577.40] Yes? yes, Dad?
[578.43] Where are you?
[579.37] The whole family is ready here
[581.47] and the groom is missing.
[582.57] I am just leaving, 
I am just leaving.
[583.93] All I know is that
[584.97] you have to immediately be here,
[586.37] right now,
[587.87] do you understand?
[589.00] I am coming, I am coming.
[613.40] I hope everything is well at home,
[615.63] I hope Dad won’t be getting angry.
[619.43] Where is Dua?
[621.37] It has been so late.
[637.97] You sisters were in
 such a rush to get ready,
[641.17] and now that you are ready,
[642.43] your sister hasn’t come to pick you.
[645.50] I was thinking this myself,
[647.70] I don’t know 
why hasn’t she come yet.
[650.13] They might be thinking that
[651.63] there is still time for 
me to get ready so…
[654.57] Will you do me a favor?
[656.33] Can you send someone to
 my home with a message,
[659.23] then they will come to pick me up.
[660.70] Sorry, how can 
I send someone?
[662.67] Do one thing, call them.
[665.73] Umm, do you know,
[667.60] I don’t have a phone.
[669.30] Okay, if you don’t have a phone,
[670.50] someone at your 
home would have it,
[672.27] give me their number,
[673.37] and I will call them from my phone.
[675.80] Yes, there is,
[677.03] our Dad has a phone
[679.63] but I don’t remember his number.
[681.73] Then you just wait,
[683.70] we have been very 
late too because of you.
[702.27] Hmm, keep this too.
[710.80] Sir,
[711.87] all the preparations are completed,
[713.50] what do you think,
[714.77] shall we move forward?
[716.27] Yes, we will just go.
[750.30] These are 4,000, 6,000,
[752.80] 45,000,
[754.37] Oh God, what sort of .
a bill have you made?
[756.80] I asked you not to,
[757.70] I even asked my wife
[759.00] that I wouldn’t pay that much.
[760.17] Hey brother Aslam,
[761.17] you are getting your 
first daughter married,
[763.53] don’t worry about the bill,
[764.70] I have spoken to sister-in-law,
[766.53] we will do it,
[767.37] we will do it, that’s not a problem.
[769.20] Look Muzammil, 
I won’t give you a single penny,
[770.80] I am honestly telling you.
[771.27] Brother Aslam,  no problem, 
we will do it later.
[773.53] Okay fine.
[775.20] Put this properly, do it.
[777.83] Fehmida?
[779.97] Fehmida?
[782.67] Where are both of them?
[784.53] They haven’t come back yet.
[787.27] I don’t know
[788.70] what’s taking them so long,
[790.67] they should have
 been back by now.
[792.07] Hey, all the boys of the world are
 standing outside in the tent,
[796.37] now they will pass them with
 their faces full of makeup,
[799.43] it will be like Doom’s Day,
[800.83] I should die of shame.
[802.67] Why are you thinking like this?
[803.93] Both of them are
 covered in a long veil,
[805.13] they would be wearing it.
[806.13] 5 minutes,
[807.97] you and your daughters
 just have 5 minutes,
[811.37] if they don’t come back
 in the next 5 minutes,
[813.80] it will be the end of times!
[815.63] I will go check.
[817.77] Sania, get my veil from inside,
[820.40] I will go check myself
[822.57] why the salon girl made 
her sit there for so long.
[824.90] Okay,
[825.70] it means you will go alone
 to the salon at this time in this condition?
[829.63] It’s just 2 streets away,
[831.57] I will immediately 
go and bring them.
[833.90] No,
[835.27] I am not the shameless that
[836.50] I would let you go alone.
[837.47] I will come along too.
[838.70] Your daughters will bring disgrace to 
me in front of the whole world.
[842.90] He won’t be able to do anything.
[844.33] Give it to me.
[850.13] I am afraid that
 sisters might get scolded.
[880.00] Hey?
[881.23] The auto rickshaw is here,
[882.43] call the daughters.
[883.47] Hey, what was the need for this?
[887.03] The house is just in the back street,
[888.40] we could have walked.
[890.03] Yeah sure, spread shamelessness,
[891.47] spread all the shamelessness you want.
[892.80] You want people to get attracted
 to our girls' bangles.
[896.60] The ones who are not even looking,
[897.50] you will show it to them as well.
[899.67] I was just saying.
[901.20] You were just saying.
[905.50] My daughter looks so beautiful.
[907.90] And what about Dua?
 Isn’t she ready yet?
[909.40] Yeah?
[911.17] I am telling you honestly, 
Fehmida Begum,
[912.07] I am not going to spare you.
[913.60] I won’t even wait till we get home.
[915.40] Speak slowly.
[917.40] Where is she, my child? Call her.
[919.60] Mom, Dua left two hours ago.
[923.00] Where?
[923.63] Where did she go?
[925.30] Hun
[927.60] What are you saying, my child?
[929.70] Where is Dua?
[931.50] Both of us are 
here to pick both of you.
[933.83] Mom, actually, I had to get ready
[937.27] and she was ready,
[938.07] the beautician said 
it would take two hours,
[940.40] so Dua said I would go 
home and help Mom,
[943.90] and I asked her to 
come before 2 hours,
[946.43] it was so late,
[947.40] I was waiting for 
her to pick me up.
[949.93] Damn it!
[952.43] She didn’t get home,
[953.63] it got so late
[954.30] that is why we came 
here to pick both of you.
[958.57] Mom, Dua is not here.
[960.77] She didn’t even get home then
[963.67] where did she go?
[965.20] I don’t understand.
[967.20] Hey?
[968.03] Hey, the groom’s family 
is about to be here
[969.63] and you guys are putting
 up this show here?
[971.20] It is all your fault, Fehmida Begum,
[973.03] it’s all your fault,
[974.37] I even told you not to send 
them to the beauty parlor,
[977.07] now look,
[977.90] the daughter went missing.
[979.47] What are you saying?
[981.73] I?
[982.67] What am I saying?
[984.23] Where did Dua go? Tell me.
[985.43] She might be at someone’s 
house in our street.
[988.33] Her hair wasn’t getting fixed
[990.43] so she said…
[991.10] She might be at 
Sister Bilquees’s house.
[993.40] Let me just find her today,
[995.83] I will kill her.
[997.43] come,
[998.07] come and sit in the rickshaw.
[999.07] Come.
[1002.63] Come.
[1008.27] What should I do?
[1011.60] I should inform Baba Saeein.
[1018.13] Hello,
[1018.70] yes Baba Saeein,
[1020.13] Baba Saeein,
[1022.20] Saeein Jr got shot,
[1026.40] yes Baba Saeein
[1027.80] I am at the hospital.
[1030.77] Yes. Come.
[1038.63] Come, my son.
[1043.23] Hey, where is the forehead garland?
[1045.97] What do I know?
[1048.13] I will bring it myself.
[1050.90] Hey.
[1053.57] So, did you tell Dua?
[1056.50] Why would I tell her?
[1057.23] We broke up.
[1058.37] Break up?
[1060.60] You look exactly like a hero.
[1061.87] Obviously, I will look like a hero
[1062.90] when I am a hero.
[1064.27] I am getting a call, I will be right back.
[1065.53] Yeah, yeah sure.
[1067.50] My son looks so handsome.
[1073.13] Sarfaraz, my Dad got unwell,
[1075.17] he has been taken to the hospital,
[1076.27] so I won’t be able to make it
 to the wedding with you.
[1078.20] Hey, no, no, you must go,
[1079.30] he needs you.
[1080.57] Pray for him.
[1082.10] Yes, son, you must go. Go.
[1086.20] May God keep things well.
[1088.00] Where is your Dad?
[1089.70] He was in so much rush to go
[1091.43] and now I don’t know
[1092.03] where did he go to get the garland.
[1093.20] Go and check him.
[1094.60] I will go see.
[1097.67] My son looks very nice.
[1103.93] We even went to Bilquees’s house,
[1106.47] Hmmm
[1107.50] she was not even there,
[1109.33] did the sky hog her,
[1111.53] or did the ground swallow her?
[1113.03] Where did she go?
[1114.67] For God’s sake, Mr. Aslam,
[1116.23] speak slowly,
[1118.03] the guests are sitting
 outside our house.
[1119.97] I think your girl ran with some lover
[1123.80] and you are asking 
me to speak slowly?
[1125.30] Hey, Dua is not like this,
[1128.33] God knows how
my daughter would be.
[1130.87] If she is not like that
[1131.67] then go find her and bring her.
[1133.93] Otherwise, I will hang you 
and everyone to a fan
[1136.17] and shoot myself,
[1138.33] there wouldn’t be a wedding 
at home but a funeral.
[1141.40] Oh Fehmida,
[1144.30] Fehmida, this is your leverage
[1146.87] that your daughters are
 throwing dirt on my face today.
[1149.77] Why are you thinking this?
[1151.53] She could have even met an accident,
[1156.13] may my words have no effect
[1159.20] but she could have
 been kidnapped too.
[1162.53] However, the dirt will
 be on me in both cases.
[1165.77] My, my heart is sinking Mr. Aslam,
[1169.87] for God’s sake find her 
somewhere and bring her home.
[1172.20] Who should I go and ask?
[1173.83] The groom’s family?
[1175.20] One of the daughters has eloped
[1176.37] and the other one is ready.
[1177.77] Why do you want
[1179.17] people to throw the dirt 
of defamation on me
[1180.87] instead of congratulating
 me for the wedding?
[1183.70] I cannot even sit here and cry,
[1186.33] go find my daughter somehow.
[1188.23] Tell me what should I do?
[1189.70] She must have 
a friend or someone,
[1191.60] someone she knows.
[1193.07] Ask her,
[1193.90] the friends usually 
know everything that
[1195.70] whom is she having an affair with.
[1197.70] Rida, Rida, she is just 
friends with sister Rida.
[1200.77] So then ask her,
[1201.77] get me her phone number.
[1202.90] Do you have her number?
[1204.97] Sister once wrote it in my copy.
[1207.27] Go get it.
[1207.60] I will bring it.
[1209.70] And look at you,
[1210.70] you are here all dressed up,
[1212.63] you so wanted to be a bride,
[1214.37] you couldn’t have 
stopped your sister.
[1216.37] Now you are looking at my face.
[1217.77] She is rubbing dirt on my face.
[1221.03] Oh God.
[1295.40] Here,
[1296.53] this is sister Rida’s number.
[1297.87] Quickly give it to me.
[1300.03] Show it to me.
[1301.70] Pray, just keep on praying.
[1314.20] Hello?
[1315.27] Dua’s father speaking.
[1317.23] Yes? Yes, Uncle?
[1319.27] I am just here.
[1321.87] Rida, Sister Rida is here herself.
[1324.77] Greetings, Aunt.
[1326.10] How are you?
[1327.53] I couldn’t see any of you outside
[1329.53] so I came in myself.
[1332.63] Where is Dua?
[1333.80] I don’t see her around.
[1336.63] This, we called you to ask this.
[1340.10] Dua invited me to Fiza’s wedding.
[1345.27] What do you guys want to ask me?
[1347.63] Where is Dua? Tell us.
[1351.37] Why are you guys asking me this?
[1355.57] She went to the salon
[1358.17] and didn’t come back.
[1360.03] Do you know where did she go?
[1362.17] How can I tell, uncle,
[1364.07] where did she go?
[1366.60] Friends know everything
[1368.67] if their friend is having 
an affair with someone.
[1370.50] Look uncle,
[1371.90] Dua hasn’t even been coming
 to the university for so many days
[1375.57] and it has been so many days 
that I haven’t even met her.
[1378.73] I don’t know.
[1379.63] Hey, I am asking 
who did Dua elope with?
[1383.43] How can I tell, Uncle?
[1385.50] And why would she run 
away from home anyway?
[1388.67] My child,
[1390.63] my child, there is no
 clue of Dua anywhere,
[1393.27] if you know something just tell us.
[1397.40] Look, Aunt,
[1399.00] I honestly don’t know anything.
[1400.93] I don’t know anything.
[1404.07] You guys should 
call Dua’s number,
[1406.93] she will tell you herself
 as to where she is.
[1409.40] Dua’s, Dua’s phone?
[1413.30] Since when did she have a phone?
[1415.40] She never had a phone.
[1416.90] Uncle, Dua had a phone.
[1423.07] My child, that was your phone
[1426.30] and she returned it to you 
the very next day.
[1428.70] No Aunt,
[1429.93] you guys definitely have 
some misunderstanding,
[1432.73] it was Dua’s phone,
[1434.83] now only Dua can tell where 
the phone came from or who gave it to her,
[1439.57] how can I tell?
[1441.73] My child,
[1443.33] you give me the phone number,
[1444.90] give it to me.
[1445.70] I will send it to you.
[1456.37] I have sent it to you, uncle.
[1460.30] Call her.
[1461.57] You are looking at my face.
[1464.13] Okay now,
[1466.03] I will leave then, Aunt. Bye.
[1514.37] Where is our Nosherwan?
[1515.93] How is Nosherwan?
[1517.53] Sir, his operation is going on.
[1523.53] How did all this happen?
[1529.03] We were on our way,
[1531.77] and the snipers attacked us.
[1538.83] Saeein,
[1541.63] I don’t have the courage to 
lose Nosherwan after Zawar now.
[1549.80] Amma Saeein.
[1569.53] Do you believe me now?
[1571.30] Yeah?
[1572.00] Fehmida?
[1573.43] Are you satisfied now
[1574.73] that your daughter has eloped?
[1576.63] If she hadn’t run away,
[1577.77] someone would have stopped her,
[1579.13] she would have made some noise,
[1580.83] and the people at the salon
 would have come out to help her.
[1583.67] Admit that she has
 run away with her lover.
[1586.83] No, Dua is not that kind of a girl,
[1590.57] she cannot do this.
[1591.87] If she cannot do this then tell me
[1593.43] where did she get a phone from?
[1594.87] God knows,
[1597.43] I don’t know about the phone.
[1599.00] Oh wow!
[1599.70] Your daughter has a mobile phone
[1600.87] and the mother doesn’t even know.
[1602.90] I saw it with her once,
[1605.47] and she said it was her friend’s,
[1607.07] she returned it the next day.
[1608.63] Just let me speak on 
the phone once,
[1612.67] then to all three of you, I will…
[1614.27] Dad? Dad, please.
[1682.23] How is my son?
[1683.47] He is out of danger.
[1689.17] He got shot in the shoulder.
[1691.53] He will be conscious 
after some time
[1693.57] and then we will shift
 him to the room.
[1696.07] As you know it’s a police case,
[1699.80] so please handle it.
[1704.00] Thank you.
[1705.10] Thank you.
[1709.67] God had mercy on my motherhood.
[1743.10] Your daughter is not 
picking up the phone.
[1746.73] She can also be in some trouble.
[1749.27] What trouble?
[1751.27] There is nothing difficult for girls
 who run away from home.
[1756.20] Dua is not that kind of a girl,
[1757.87] I am sure something
 bad has happened to her.
[1760.00] What kind of a girl she is,
[1761.07] that’s in front of everyone now.
[1762.80] Mother doesn’t even know
[1764.13] that her daughter 
has a mobile phone,
[1766.40] I will give you a …
[1767.50] Dad? Dad, please. Please.
[1779.53] Oh God, save my honor.
[1784.13] Hey Dua, pick up the phone.
[1802.77] What is the update on Dua?
[1806.30] Yes, it was her sister’s wedding today.
[1814.10] Okay, but I told you…
[1816.43] Nosherwan.
[1817.63] You made everyone worried, Jaffar.
[1820.00] Worried what?
[1821.83] May you get your mother’s life.
[1823.60] God has given you a new life.
[1833.80] How is my lion?
[1837.37] I am fine, Baba Sahab,
[1839.80] I am fine.
[1841.17] Nosherwan,
[1843.07] everyone got so worried after hearing
 about the attack on you.
[1849.73] Where are the kids?
[1852.07] They are at the mansion.
[1858.53] We couldn’t think of anything else 
after hearing about the news of your attack.
[1863.00] But still, you shouldn’t have left
the kids alone and come here like this.
[1867.77] Don’t worry,
[1869.43] Priya and the other
 servants are with them.
[1874.90] Oh, careful, careful.
[1878.37] May God send that ill-bred to hell,
[1881.60] he attacked my motherhood.
[1888.40] My son.
[1919.63] Mr. Aslam, the groom, and his
 family have arrived outside.
[1927.23] Really?
[1928.60] Go and make everyone sit.
[1934.10] What should I do now?
[1935.63] What should I do?
[1936.43] Tell me.
[1937.63] Should I go out and tell 
everyone that the girl ran away?
[1941.57] For God’s sake, 
be quiet, Mr. Aslam.
[1945.53] Why are you ruining her fate 
because of one daughter?
[1952.57] What should I do then?
[1953.97] Tell me.
[1955.40] Dua, let me just get you once,
[1958.67] I will kill you myself.
[1962.13] Whatever will happen
 with that ill-fated,
[1964.30] it will happen later,
[1968.20] think about this daughter,
[1970.90] what is her fault?
[1974.50] At least let this poor girl get married.
[1977.10] So then what should I do?
[1977.93] Yeah?
[1978.57] I should go happily to the people?
[1980.83] I won’t be able to do that.
[1981.97] We have to do it, Mr. Aslam,
[1983.70] we have to do 
the exact same thing.
[1985.43] We have to go through this test to 
respectfully get Fiza married,
[1992.53] no matter if our hearts 
are crying from inside,
[1998.40] we still have to smile.
[2000.47] Yeah and what should
 I tell everyone about Dua?
[2010.60] I will handle it,
[2012.60] you just go
[2014.10] and welcome 
the groom and family.
[2016.63] It would have been better had 
I died before witnessing this day.
[2024.53] Come, Sania,
[2025.77] come,
[2026.70] you come with me,
[2027.77] come.
[2028.53] And look fix your face.
[2032.40] Smile.
[2033.77] Smile and go.
[2037.73] Fiza, my child,
[2041.57] you go inside and fix yourself,
[2047.07] wipe the tears,
[2049.30] okay?
[2050.13] And tell everyone
[2055.67] that Dua is not well,
[2058.30] she is not well
 she is resting in her room,
[2062.23] okay?
[2065.07] I will go out.
[2081.93] Dua.
[2083.43] Where are you?
