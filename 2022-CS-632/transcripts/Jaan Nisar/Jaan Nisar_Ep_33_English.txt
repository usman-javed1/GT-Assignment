My mother and my sisters live here. Not once, I will come here repeatedly, and no one will have 
the courage to stop me. Have food. I am not hungry.
I will eat when I get hungry. Please stop now. End this anger. Have some food. Dua is your child. I did what I had to on your instructions. Your wish has been fulfilled. Now why are you 
standing here watching me? So, you too forgive her. So, she too finds peace 
and you do too. I have nothing for her. Not even forgiveness. Please don't harden your heart
so much towards her. Look Fehmida, it would be better to do your work. Understand? If I need to, I will eat if I get hungry then. So, why are you upset over food? Eat a little… Fehmida, take it away. Your daughter has become very arrogant. How she was threatening
in front of everyone that no one could stop
her from coming home. And listen, did you ask her where she ran away to? Listen to me. The daughter is mine, the problem is of my home, why do you have a problem? I am just talking, you are getting upset for no reason. I am your daughter, and you cannot even deny
this relationship after you die. Brother Niaz, I will pay you
a hundred rupees tomorrow, okay? Greetings. Greetings. You had to pay me money. Hey, man, I got a little late.
Take it next week. Why are you misbehaving? I am telling you, I will give it. You also told me last week
that you will give it. I will leave after taking the money today. You touched me again. I am telling you,
don’t touch me again and again… Don’t misbehave. 
I am asking you nicely… I told you not to touch me. What are you doing? Don’t misbehave Mr. Aslam.
What is the problem? What happened? Madam, he took a loan from me. I am asking him for it, 
and he is misbehaving. How much is the amount? Ten thousand. Come on, Papa. Come on. You left this love a long time back. Now, if someone
else has taken your place, then tolerate it. If I could tolerate it would I have taken such an extreme step? Listen, Farah, I have promised Dua, 
I will never cheat her. And I mean it. I will never cheat her. Madam, have food. When I have told you
that I don’t want to eat, then why do you bring
it again and again? Madam, Mr. Jaffar has strictly
told me to take care of you. Tell your Mr. Jaffar, not to worry about me, okay? You also have to go to
the hospital for your check-up as well. Mr. Jaffar had said that you be ready, he will come to take you to the hospital. Listen, am I a servant of your Mr. Jaffar, that I will do what he says? Mr. Jaffar… Tell Mr. Jaffar that
I don’t want to go anywhere and leave from here. But you are…. Did you not hear what I said? Leave from here. Sure… And yes, don’t bring food here again or else you will see the worst in me. I will not even take two minutes
to drag you out of here. Leave! Yes, fine. I think it is Papa. Greetings. Greetings, Papa. Child, you don’t worry about him. Mama, when will Papa’s heart be
cleaned towards Sister? Go ahead. Sir, Madam is not eating
anything since yesterday. You must have not insisted. I did. But she is not listening to me. Instead, she is threatening to drag
me out of the home and job. She is not eating food, this means, she must not be taking her medicine either. Yes, absolutely. When I told her that you
were coming to take her to the hospital, she started getting upset further. She said I will not go anywhere. Hmm. Okay. Sir, I am really scared of madam’s anger. You do something, soon. I will see. Okay, sir. What is the timing for the meeting? After lunchtime. Is Aman group coming for the meeting? Yes. I have confirmed with them. Fine, send me a hard
copy of the presentation. Okay, I will have it sent. What happened?
Do you want to say something? Yes, Bano called. Who, Bano? The same who I had hired for 
Madam Farah as her maid. Yes. Then? She was saying Madam Farah has not eaten
anything since yesterday and neither is taking her medication. This is the value I have in your eyes now, that you have left me
at the mercy of the servants? I will not eat food till you come, neither will I take my medication. Fine, you go. Sure. Okay. And if something happens to me then only you will be responsible for it. Do we have to go somewhere, sir? Yes, I am going out. You do one thing, deal with the client. We will just come. Hey, no, you leave it. I will go. No, sir. I cannot leave you alone. Please. Papa. With whose permission did you come here? Huh? I don’t need anyone’s
permission to come to my Papa. You are not my daughter. You are not my daughter. The relationship between
a father and daughter doesn't end with words of denial. Go. Leave from here. Leave. I permitted you to come into the home, I have not accepted you. I will not leave. No matter how many times you reject me, I will come back to your
doorstep again and again. Leave from here. Papa, please. Papa. Papa, I made a mistake. I made a very big mistake, Papa. Please don't turn your back on me like this. Forgive me. When I used to make
a mistake in childhood, you would scold me, you would beat me up, but you wouldn’t drag me out
of the home like this, Papa. Papa, please. I have no place for you in my heart. I have no place for you, Dua. Here you go. Here. Hit me. Beat me and break my bones.
Leave me. But hit me. Hit me.
Leave me. I won't leave you.
Leave me. No, I won't leave you.
Leave me. Forgive me, Papa. Don’t leave a single bone of mine, but don’t be upset with me. Hit me.
Leave me. Please. Hit me, Papa. Break my bones, but don’t get upset with me. I have made a big mistake. My child. How are you? Why are you torturing yourself by not eating
and not taking your medicine? Did you finally find some time? Did you realize that 
a girl tried to give her life for you? Whether I am there or not, it makes no difference to you. Farah, I was busy. Were you so busy that you
were not even going to your home? You were giving time to your wife and home, so why did you ignore me? Oh yes, I am nothing to you. I have no meaning in your life, right? Right now, your health is most important. Please, care for it. That’s it. Really? Do you care about me? If I did not care about you,
I wouldn’t have come here. Then you shouldn’t have. I would have died, you would have offered
prayers of thankfulness. What are you…. You have brought this here again. I have told her to do this. Keep this here and you can leave. Come on, have food. I am not hungry. Why do you act so stubbornly like a child? Am I being stubborn or
are you being stubborn? Farah, we have our
whole life for all these things. Right now, your health is important. Please, have food. Then I also have to take you to the doctor. I am saying something to you. Please. If you feed me with your hands, 
I will eat. Fine. I will die of hunger. Thank God your wound is getting better. The doctor has said that 
if you care a little, you will be absolutely fine. I don’t want my wound to heal. You are close to me because of this wound. You still talk so much nonsense. And you are the same even today. You go crazy over my slightest discomfort. I just don’t forget the lesson of humanity. Humanity? Why? Is it not love? Look, Farah, we have become mature now. Love doesn't require age, it requires madness. Like I am mad about you even today, and maybe you too are. No, I have been freed from
the captivity of those moments. Really? Then why did you save me? You should have let me die. I cannot see you dying. When you don’t have love for me then why can you not see it? What do you want? Should I also forget the lesson of humanity? What do you want? I know, you are only upset with me because I left you and went. I was, earlier, but not anymore. In fact, I think you did the right thing. Every person has
the right to decide on their choice. I made a mistake. Had I known I wouldn’t be able to live without you, then I would never have gone. Give me my phone. I told you to give me my phone. You cannot talk to her with me here. What was this? When I said that you won’t answer her call, 
in front of me, so, you will not answer it. Your tea. I will drink it. I will drink it. I don’t even have the words. By forgiving Dua like this,
you have done a favor on motherhood. For that, I have forgiven you. I don’t know why I feel
I made an emotional decision. How long can parents
stay upset with their children? Fehmida, I am thinking
about what people will say. Mr. Aslam, do you still care about people? These people… these people who used to point
fingers at my daughter until yesterday, are now sitting with their fingers clenched 
in their teeth, looking at her grandeur. These people are only for pointing fingers at the oppressed. Where did Dua get all these guards,
cars, and so much money from? She was in very bad
condition at the police station. You didn’t open your home’s door for Dua, but perhaps God had mercy on her. Before she would suffer from
wandering and hardships, Ghaznavi came into her life. Who…Who Ghaznavi? Nosherwan Ghaznavi. He is really rich. 
He has a lot of money. He married our Dua. She is really happy. He has kept her really happy. Is he the same one for whom
Dua ran from the home? Hey, no, no. That damned man was someone else. Mr. Aslam, you will see, just as he made my Dua wander aimlessly, he too will be left wandering and will never find peace. Our Dua, despite everything, was reunited with us. Now, we can only pray to God
to protect us from further trials. Thank you, child. Hey, I am thinking of inviting
my friend’s family over for dinner. Which friend? Hassam. Is he the same one who is settled in the US? Yes, son, the same. Okay. So, I have told you many times before to please talk to him about settling me there. Son, to settle down there, a person needs to be somewhat steadfast. You are not that. You have to do a lot of things yourself, and here, you don’t even move
and drink a glass of water. Papa, when things become difficult, one does what needs to be done. Please talk to them. Okay fine, I will talk to him. It is still not that late. But first, you get a job here
and do it properly. What is there in a job here? Even if I work here for several years, what will be the result? At most, I will earn a hundred thousand
or one fifty thousand. What can a person do with that? Think a little. Okay, tell me, did he come here from America for good, or did he only come on holiday? No, no, he came on holiday. He will go back. Okay, okay. His wife was very sociable. Please let me know
when you are inviting them, and also tell me
what should be made for dinner. Hey, he will confirm till tomorrow, then I will also tell you
what needs to be cooked. You women can take care of everything. By the way, you usually cook
traditional food at such parties. No, no, the reason I was asking was that because he is coming after a lot of years, so we don’t know their likes and dislikes. Who knows, they might
prefer international cuisine. Hey, no, Hassam is the same old, he hasn’t changed even a little. Papa, don’t worry. Me and sister-in-law
will do everything together. Yes, Sumbul is absolutely right. Both of us will manage it. Hey, I know my daughters
will manage everything together. But Hassam also has
another reason for coming here. What reason? The thing is, Hassam has expressed his liking
for our Sumbul for his son, Fahad. Really? This is really good news. Yes, but Papa, have you met Fahad? Have you seen him or not? I have met him,
but it was a long time ago. He was a child back then, now he has grown up. Hassam was telling me
he is a mechanical engineer. But more importantly, he is Hassam’s son. And when they come, you can meet them. Okay, we will see. Such a good proposal. My daughter’s fate has really shined. One minute. Hey, did you see? Did you see her? She felt shy hearing about her proposal. It feels as though, I met my own after a long time. Sania, Fiza, Mama, everyone was really happy. Really, really happy. And your Papa? He didn’t agree. He too will agree. At least, this much happened
that he let you come inside, he let you meet everyone. All this is because of you. What did I do? The Dua from yesterday
was nameless, insignificant. The position I have achieved
today is because of you. Now, before anyone points a finger at me, they think a hundred times. Because you are
Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s respect. You scared me. You took so long to come today. I had some work. The work was so important that you didn’t even have time
to listen to what I wanted to say. The nature of the work was such. You tell me, you were really excited. You said you couldn’t
tell me on the phone. Hmmm. Is everything okay? Because I wanted to tell you face to face. What is it that you want to
tell me face to face? I went to Mama’s home. Yes, I know. Papa forgave me. What? Really? Yes. This is a matter of great happiness. Right? Yes. You ought to be happy like this. I am really happy. And I want you to
stay happy like this all your life. I am really happy. After all, I am the only owner of your love.
