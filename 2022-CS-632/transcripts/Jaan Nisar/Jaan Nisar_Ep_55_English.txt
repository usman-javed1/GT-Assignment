Yes, is everything fine? Did Ghaznavi say anything else? How did you get inside my house
and who let you in? Why are you even asking how I got in and who let me in? Forget all that. You should realize that I don't care about my life. Even knowing everything, I still came inside to meet you. Look, leave Ghaznavi and come to me. Even today, I am waiting for you. Shut your mouth. I can keep my mouth shut, but what about my love? It keeps screaming your name. Look, Dua, I divorced your sister only because
you and I could be together. Try to realize this a little. Even if Ghaznavi leaves you, won't you come to me? After what happened today,
do you still think he won't leave you? That he will keep you? Soon all your misunderstandings
will be cleared. And now, I'm eagerly waiting for
the moment your pride breaks. I'll enjoy it. That will never happen. How dare he call me again after
everything that happened? Who is backing him that he isn't even afraid of Ghaznavi? No Ghaznavi! For God’s sake, please don't do it. Please don't kill him. Please, please, don’t do this. Do you see how much she still cares about me? I honestly don't know. I don't know how he got here. Now you’ll say this, the guard, the gatekeepers, they’re all lying. They said Sarfaraz
keeps coming to meet you, with your permission. I won’t turn to look
at your face again. Ghaznavi, please, listen to me, please. Ghaznavi, listen to me. Please, give me a chance to explain. Listen to me, please. Ghaznavi Don't you ever get tired? How bad is this? He's not even looking at you, and you're still running after him,
following him everywhere. Stop it already. He's not paying any attention to you. You're lucky that
Nosherwan has spared you so far and hasn’t thrown
you out of the house. Yet. You should be ashamed
of yourself by now. You should leave on your own. People do get ashamed
sometimes and leave. Won't you? Why are you troubling
me even more? Please, just leave. I told you I wouldn't let you live in peace. Look, the Nosherwan who used
to chant your name. Today, he doesn’t even
want to see your face. Why do I feel like you sent Sarfaraz? Even in so much tension,
your mind is still working. I didn’t send him. He’s your lover. Because of your deeds, he’s after you. How is that my fault? Enough! He’s after me not because of me, but because you sent him. Okay, let's assume for a minute
that I did send him after you. How will you prove it? Do you have any proof? Huh, I never thought you could stoop so low. Then that's your fault for
thinking that way, Dua. You are doing very wrong. You are the one
who wronged me, Dua. By coming into this home, by coming between me
and Nosherwan, I am just trying to right
the wrongs you’ve done. So what happened, dear? You don't look well. You look sick. Is everything okay? Nothing is okay, Mother. Sarfaraz has ruined my life. What has Sarfaraz done now, child? Child, when no one was at home, how was it possible
for him to come here? Mother, where Dua is, anything is possible. Why are you so surprised? When no one was home, it’s obvious that Dua must have
called Sarfaraz herself, right? Fiza, are you accusing me too? Accuse you? Why shouldn't I accuse you? If you can do so much,
why can't I say anything? I am suffering because of your actions. You ruined my home. You took my husband away from me, and now I shouldn't accuse you? Despite all my efforts, all my love, the man who never cared about me, reached your home and is now circling around you
because he wants to marry you. This wants to make me die
of embarrassment. My former husband, the father of my unborn child, who didn’t even think about
our baby when he divorced me. He is desperate to marry my sister
and is losing his mind over her. This situation is humiliating. How do you not feel ashamed? Why don't you die of shame? Stop it, Fiza. Just stop it. Don’t fight each other. Mother, let her speak. I want to hear how much
venom she has for me. I need to know
how much she hates me. Dua, the day you realize what my heart has gone
through because of you, that day you won’t
question me about it. Child, don’t worry. She…. A man entered my house, played with my dignity
in front of my eyes, and he’s still alive, just because of you. You saved him. What you saw wasn’t the truth. I understand perfectly now
what is true and what is false. You want me to leave you, and for you to go to him.
That’s your and his plan, right? I will not let this happen
while I am alive. You will stay in this house. I will not leave you until my last breath. But now, I won't even look at your face again. If you can do so much, why can't I say anything? I am suffering because of your actions. You ruined my home. You took my husband away from me, and now I shouldn't accuse you? Despite all my efforts, all my love, the man who never cared about me, reached your home and is now circling around you
because he wants to marry you. This wants to make me die
of embarrassment. My former husband, the father of my unborn child, who didn’t even think about
our baby when he divorced me. He is desperate to marry my sister
and is losing his mind over her. I divorced your sister only
because you and I could be together. Now, I eagerly await the day
when your pride breaks. I will thoroughly enjoy it. How do you not feel ashamed? Why don't you die of shame? Madam? Oh God, Madam, Madam, what happened to you? Madam, wake up. Madam, Madam, Madam. I told you earlier to be careful
about her diet and health, but it seems you have been careless. If this continues, her life may be in danger. Why aren’t you taking care of her? There won't be any more negligence. Look, if you care about her life, take very good care of her. Her condition isn't good. I think she hasn't eaten
for several days. Anyway, I’ve started a drip, and I’m prescribing some
new medicine for her. Please give it to her on time and take special care of her health. Thank you. Take care. Let’s go. Eat something. I don't feel like it. Perhaps you didn’t hear
what the doctor said. If you want to bring
this child into the world, you have to take care of yourself. You don't care about me. Why should I take care of myself? Stop saying such nonsense
and eat your food. Why don't you just leave us alone? Why do you keep coming
into our bedroom? I, I’m only here to take care of you. Dua, if it bothers you so much, I’ll leave. Okay. What bothers you about
her standing here? I want to talk to you in private. Why does she keep
disturbing our privacy? There isn’t any privacy
between us now. How will I make you believe me? I have given you so many clarifications, I have said many things, but… Sarfaraz is lying, he is not telling the truth at all. He wants to fill poison in your mind so that you’ll leave me. That’s the only way his
revenge will be complete. Do you think I'm a fool? No one can say such
a big thing so easily. And if he is lying, then why did he divorce Fiza? Only to marry you. Just tell me what I should do. Whatever you ask, I will do it. If you ask me to swear,
I will swear. Please believe me. There’s no need for that. Just eat your food
and take your medicine. I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of the doctor again. Okay, I’ll eat, but on one condition. You have to stay here with me. Don’t make such conditions
that I can't fulfill. Fine, you don’t love me, but at least you care about my life, right? Can’t you do this much for me? Now I’ll strike in a way, Dua, that you won’t be able
to escape this time. Oh, Madam, do you need anything? No, I don't need anything. I will cook for Ghaznavi. But Madam, you’re not well. And if Sir finds out,
he’ll be furious, Madam. Nothing will happen. Just give me all the ingredients, and I’ll cook myself. I’ll tell you what I’ll make, you just give me the ingredients. Alright I made all this for you today. How did you know that
tandoori chicken is my favorite? It’s actually his favorite. I made it for him. Oh yes, how could I forget? This is Nosherwan’s favorite. Then let Nosherwan eat first,
and we will eat afterward. Here, take it. What happened? When the doctor told you
not to do all this and to rest. Why aren’t you following orders? Don't embarrass me
in front of the doctor again. No, I just get bored sitting idle. I made it for you.
If you eat, I’ll feel good. Please pass me a fork. Here you go. Sit down. Why are you standing? Sure. Ghaznavi, what's wrong with you? Nosherwan, Nosherwan, what’s wrong? Water… Water, water! Here,
have some water. What is wrong? Nosherwan! What was in the food? Did you poison it? No, no, Ghaznavi! What have you done? Tell the truth, was there something in the food Dua? Nosherwan! Jaffar! Nosherwan are you okay? Jaffar, come here quickly. What happened to Sir? Saeein ate the food,
but I have no idea what was in it. Look at his condition! I think there was poison in the food. We need to take him to the hospital. Don’t touch him. Don’t touch him! Isn't it enough that
you poisoned him? No, no, I… Nosherwan! -Move aside.
-Khaliq! Habib! Zafar! Where are you going? You’re not going anywhere. Murderers are not allowed to leave. We will go with Saeein, you will stay here. What’s wrong, Kashmala?
Why are you crying? Is everything okay? Amma Saeein, a catastrophe has struck us,
Amma Saeein. Amma Saeein,
Dua has poisoned Nosherwan, Amma Saeein. Please come fast. Amma Saeein. Oh God! Hello, what happened child,
is everything alright? The doctors are saying
that his condition is critical, Baba Saeein, all of you,
please come fast, we’re in the hospital.
Please come fast, Baba Saeein. Yes, child, we are leaving right away. Don’t worry, child,
take care of yourself. We are coming, we are coming. Let’s go. Let’s go quickly. Jaffar, Ghaznavi… You should go from here Just let me see him once. Is he okay? You should leave. Once Sir regains full consciousness, then we will speak with you. For now, please go. She poisoned Saeein
right in front of my eyes, and I couldn’t do anything. How could I have known that Dua…. that Dua put poison in Saeein’s food? Amma Saeein, doctors… the doctors are saying that Saeein’s chances of survival are low. Saeein, if something happens to our Nosherwan, I won’t be able to bear it. Amma Saeein, please don’t cry. Pray to God that
our Saeein gets well soon. Jaffar, throw this girl out of here!
