What thought are you lost in? Put in some effort. Massage them properly. I was thinking about something. What are you thinking about? Sister Kausar had come to take measurements 
for Fiza’s bangles and shoes. So, during the conversation, she mentioned that 
she was greedy for dowry. She was saying the same thing 
again and again. Women manage the home economics, what do men have to do with it? What Sister Kausar said 
has worried me. It feels as though, Brother Nazeer spoke about
 not taking the dowry himself. She knows nothing about this. Listen, Brother Nazir said no 
to dowry damning it. He is a good man, 
a decent man. He has said no, that’s it. Now if his woman is being greedy, 
then what do I do? But Mr. Aslam, our daughter has to stay 
at home all day long with her Mother and Sister-in-law. God knows what sort of things they say, and how they taunt our daughter. You women really like worrying. You stay worried yourself, you also have the men worried. You don’t worry, I will talk to Brother Nazir to talk to the women of his home 
about the nonsense they are speaking. No. No. No. You will not talk. You will not talk at all. Hey, Sister Kausar will dislike it for no reason. I will surely talk. They started it. Even if the marriage stops. What are you saying? Why should we stop the wedding? The entire neighborhood 
has found out that it is our daughter’s wedding. God forbid, if the wedding stops again, then people will say all sorts of things. It is possible, I may have had some misunderstanding. I might not have understood 
what she said, properly. Tell me something honestly, Fehmida. Did she say this or did you think of it? I made a mistake. 
I heard wrong. Hey, whose phone is this? Where did you get it from? I just got it. It is really cheap. You cannot take pictures in this. You were strongly against it. You used to call it an instigator. So, what? Have I become an infidel buying it? Huh? I didn’t buy it to have affairs. It is the need of today. Now if the car has been invented then should I go on a horse? Now if I have to talk to people, should I write letters? What do I do? And one more thing, I am noticing Fehmida, you have started to talk 
with a lot of sarcasm. You have started acting really sarcastic. No, there is nothing like that. I saw the phone with you, so I asked. Okay, if we are not giving dowry, then give me some money. I will make a few dresses for Fiza, and we will also have 
to get new clothes for Dua and Sania to wear 
at the wedding. Why? What rules state that it is necessary to wear a 
new dress in the wedding? It is the first happiness of the home, so the girls have desires. I don’t have money for these, tantrums. I am telling you clearly. Tell your daughters to fulfill their desires with 
their husbands after marriage. We will not have any henna functions. These are really cheap functions. Hun Even if the in-laws don’t come, but we will have Fiza sit for 
her henna at our home. The girls wish that the girls from the neighborhood, friends, and all would apply
 turmeric cream to her. The home will become lively, 
what else? Don’t come to get a penny from me. I have no money. Yes. Spend from your own pocket. And one more thing, no need to invite a lot of people. If things get sorted with 
four to five food pots, it is enough. If I could, I would have managed in one pot. But that’s it, don’t invite too many people. And use your hand, do something now. You have driven me mad. Be quick. Let me sleep a little. This one will really good on me, right? Yes, wear it at the wedding, okay? Yes. See, it has so much embroidery. Make me breakfast. It is 2 pm in the afternoon and you want breakfast. Mend your habits, you are going to get married. What habits do I mend? And it is a holiday, so a person will wake up at this time. Are you making breakfast or should I go out and have it? Why are you getting angry? Just give me five minutes, I will bring breakfast. Be quick. Hey, where are you going? Sit. Look at this. I got these dresses made for Fiza. You too have a look and let me know
which one is good. Wow. Mama, I know a lot about them, and I know all this really well. Hey, you got it, you would know better. It is good. Bring the breakfast to the room. Why do I feel Brother doesn’t 
want to get married? No, no, there is nothing like that. He just woke up, that’s why he is out of his mind. You quickly give him breakfast or else he will start screaming again. Oh God, I pray that Fiza comes home soon, and takes care of her tantrums. We are tired. Amen. Amen. I will go give him breakfast. This Sunday is so boring. Why? Yes, you have to clean and mop. You be quiet and focus on your work. All the people of the world, party. They plan dinners. They all do good. And us? We middle-class people wait for Sunday, so that we setup the washing machine 
and wash clothes. Are you going somewhere? Yes, I am going to get the committee. Pray that I get it. Hey, the wedding is around the corner, you should have let Fiza rest. You two should have worked. No, no, these people were telling me not to, I am just busy with work myself. Hey, child, you should rest. We will let her rest. We will make our beloved Fiza rest too. But tell me, when will we go shopping? I have to shop a lot and I will get a pink dress 
for myself at the wedding. She will wear red, right? Yes, sure. We will shop soon. Sania. Yes, Mama. Child, come, close the door. Go. Go, do some work. Bride. By the way, bride, don’t you think this will be the most
unique wedding in the world? Because I still haven’t seen 
the face of my Brother-in-law. Hey, Sumbul came that day, did you not see the picture? No, because she was saying my Brother, 
my Brother, my Brother, so much, that her phone switched off by the time
she tried to show me the picture. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. God will ask you, for what you have done just now. I am going to go hang the clothes. Yes, I am also coming. No. No. No. No. You rest. Did you not hear what Mama said? Make my daughter rest. Hmmm So, my beloved bride, put on turmeric cream and go to sleep. Hey, what is it? I am coming. I will help you.
No, not at all. The work will get done sooner. After all, see, there are so many clothes. Come on. What did you think about Dua? Are you serious about her? Hello. Yes, hello. Are you going to university tomorrow? Yes, why? Fine. We are meeting tomorrow, and I will pick you up from outside. But Faraz, I had told you, give me a chance. I have given you all the chance
 that I could. Now everything is getting 
out of my tolerance. What is getting out of your tolerance? I will tell you when you meet me. But… No, buts, we are meeting tomorrow. That’s it. One minute. Open up, quickly. What? Who were you talking to? Who will I talk to alone in the room? My clothes had gotten wet, so I thought I would change them. Dua, I have heard it with my own ears, you were talking to someone. Me? I was not talking. I was dancing, so I was singing along with it. I locked the door. Had Mama and Papa seen it, they would have scolded me. Why do you do such things that you get scolded by Mama and Papa? They always have an issue with me. Whether I do something or not. What are you doing? I have to wash the sheets. These are the last ones that are left. Please take out new sheets
and keep them. Come on. Come and work. My hands get spoiled. You didn’t call, so God knows what sort of thoughts 
I was getting in my heart. Don’t even think that your Faraz will cheat you. I love you a lot. What is the need to put on this makeup 
for going to the university? It is not makeup, it is a lip balm. Whatever it is. I shouldn’t see you leaving the home
in this dressing in future. Go, wash your face. Why? Because you are not 
going to the university. I am not going to the university?
Reason? I got my committee, we will go to the market for shopping. Mama, shall we go for shopping tomorrow? Why? What is there, today? You were the one who made 
the most noise for shopping. Yes, that’s true. But, I have something really important 
to do at university today. What do you have to do? You forget about going to the university
 till Fiza’s marriage. There are a hundred things 
to do at home. Sania is young and what will I 
continue to do on my own? She is not so young. She always does a lot of work. She always talks, and 
she will do some work. So, what? Mama, please let me go. It is really necessary for me 
to go to the university. I swear. I swear it is really necessary. Look Dua, there is no point in arguing. Let Fiza rest. You come with me. There is a lot of work left in the kitchen. Come and help me out. And clean this makeup of yours, we have to go to the market later on, as well. I am waiting for you. Come on. Cruel mother. At times it feels like 
I am not your daughter. Only Fiza and Sania are your daughters. I look good. What will I say to Faraz? It was really necessary to go today. After today, I will be stuck 
with the wedding. Hello. What is the meaning of saying 
no at the last moment? Hey, if you didn’t want to meet 
then you should have told me earlier. Faraz, why would I not 
want to meet you? I was ready to leave, but Mama stopped me for shopping. Okay stop it, these are 
useless excuses of yours. This is the value of what I say. Hey, no, there is nothing like that. I am telling you. Why would I not want to meet you? You go shopping. Just don’t text me, or call me. Goodbye. He got upset. Dua. Yes. Yes, coming. She thinks this is a joke. I have given her way too much importance. If I don’t talk to her for a few days, 
then her mind will be in the right place. Sister, where did you bring us? Everyone here will look at 
our veil with weird looks and no one is dressed like this, even. I feel it really weird. What is there to feel weird?
Stay confident, okay? Listen, everything here is really expensive. I think this mall is really expensive. We shouldn’t have brought Mom here Look, something will come in our range, and if nothing comes in our range, then we have the neighborhood shop.
 Shall we go? Hey, where have you brought us? There is a good shop in front. 
It is a really good shop. Cheap. Cheap shop. Come. Come on. 
You people have gone mad. Look at this. It is such a beautiful dress.
 See, how does it look? It is so pretty.
 The color is so beautiful. Madam, the trial room 
is on this side. Try it. No, I am just looking. I will look really pretty wearing this color. What is its place? Eighty thousand. Eighty thousand? This… Eighty thousand? What is so special about it? 
So expensive? What are you doing, Mama? Hey, I am checking if this embroidery 
is done with gold wires. Mama. Mama, this is the price they sell it 
for in a shop at the mall. Things are expensive. Then what was the need 
to come here? Huh? You wasted my time for 
no reason. let’s go. Wait, let me see. 
Come on. I cannot afford it. Thank you. Pack this. No. Come on. 
What are you doing? Mama, one minute. 
Let’s have fries. Which one do you want to have? Let me get it once. 
Which one? Tell me. Which are your best fries? Barbeque, madam. 
Barbeque. Make one barbeque. Do you want to have barbeque?
I will have barbeque. She will have barbeque. 
Barbeque. Which one is spicy? One of these. 
Chili powder. Stop it. Why? Come on, Mama. 
You eat it. One garlic mayo. 
One garlic mayo. One garlic mayo. 
Garlic mayo. Give this to Mama. 
Pay him. Pay him. How much, son? Six hundred, madam. Oh God, Mama. 
So much money? Hey, we could have cooked 
for one time at home. yes, sir. Ghulam Sarwar has said that you have given the order 
to take out the car. Huh? Yes. Where do we have to go? We are not going, Jaffar. 
Only I am going. You are going alone? But where? I am going to get a glimpse of Dua. Sir, you know well that 
before you leave, I have to get the recce 
of the routes done. Nothing will happen, Jaffar. No, I cannot let you go alone. She lives in the same street, where there was a commotion last time. If I go without the protocol, 
nothing will happen. Sir, I cannot take this risk. Jaffar. When I am saying I will go alone, 
so I will go alone. Fine, sir. As you wish. Faraz. Faraz. Hey Brother, what is going on here? What do you want to do? There you were going crazy in her love and here you are marrying 
a girl you don’t know. And your henna function is today? Man, what do I make you understand? I don’t understand what I should do. On one hand, 
I am unable to meet Dua, I don’t understand how I go 
and talk to Mama and Papa. You know my condition at home. They say I am useless, I don’t work, I don’t earn money. How will I take her 
in front of them? Yes, man, you are right. 
Your condition is evident. But, how can you even 
talk in this situation? Yes, you are right. But there is a way. The thing is, let this henna function 
pass somehow today. Then I will bring her in front of Mama
and say that she is the one, I want to marry her. I will fall to Mama’s feet, then it is between Mama and Papa. 
Mama will surely convince Papa. I see this as the only way. Brother, everyone is waiting for you, what are you doing here? 
Come on. Come on. Come on. 
Take Brother. Go ahead, Jaffar. Yes, sir. I have been observing you for so long, that you have not even been able 
to see a glimpse of her. If you want, 
then should I do something, sir? Jaffar, you are too much. Sir, you know well, I cannot leave you alone, 
even for a minute. Your loyalty seems like a reward 
for a good deed of mine. Fine, you do what you want to do. I too would want to see, how you can cure my ailment. Yes, sir. I will just do it. Hello. Are you still upset with your, Dua? You want to convince me, right? Yes. Fine, then meet me tomorrow. Tomorrow? Tomorrow is the wedding. Now I will be able to go the university 
after the wedding. Dua, see you are doing 
the same thing again. You are upsetting me. Okay, why do you get angry? Fine, then meet me tomorrow. I want to introduce you to Mama. Dua, my life is of no use without you. My family is forcing me to get married, I cannot wait anymore. You just meet me tomorrow. I will introduce you to Mama. Okay, I will meet you.
I will talk to you at night. No, we are meeting tomorrow. Okay. Fine. Dress up well and come. Sir. The breakfast is getting cold. Hmmm. Jaffar, I want constant updates about Dua. You will get it, Sir. They look pretty, right? Thank you, it is really good. You did good makeup. Wow. How long will it take for her makeup? It will take her two hours, at least. Two hours? So, what will I do sitting here? I will do one thing, I will go home. Then, I will come back after 
two hours and get you. Where are you going? Are you mad? You know, how angry Papa will get when 
you go home alone right now. After all, we got permission to 
come to the parlor with difficulty. Hey, stay right now. 
Where do you have to go? The home is two streets away. I will go with some child, man. Now, see, it is better that go home and 
help Mama out instead of staying here. You know how Papa worries her. Yes, fine. You are right. The poor thing’s heart is so full. She is crying on the slightest of things. Fine, but listen, come soon. Come in two hours. I cannot sit here alone for so long. I am leaving. Okay, veil. 
Wear your veil and go. I will also put on my veil. You relax. Okay? You will make a very pretty bride. 
I am scared. I will come after two hours. Okay? Be quick. If someone sees me, 
it will be an issue. Hey no one will see you,
 don’t worry. We are going. Is this your home? Yes. How do you like it? Really good. Come. I will show you the entire home. My room too. I don’t see your mother and sister. Actually, I wanted to surprise them. They didn’t know you had to come. I was not even sure about yourself. Come. Come on, we will sit here. No, we will sit outside. Hey, why would you sit outside. I have to give you a surprise. So sit inside. Come and, this is not just my room, it is our room. Come inside. You sit, I will just come. Oh! Why are you closing the door?
