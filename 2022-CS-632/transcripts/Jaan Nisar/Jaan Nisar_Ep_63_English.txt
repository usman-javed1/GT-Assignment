You contacted him? Did you contact Sarfaraz? We kept thinking that
you weren’t contacting him, he was. Today, we found out that it was you. What are you trying to do? One of your sisters has
already gotten divorced. Yours is also on the verge
of divorcing you. You people have dragged
my honor through the dirt. You have disgraced me
in front of the whole world. What do you want? Speak up. Do you want to kill me? Then give me poison and kill me. Give me poison. Dad, please don’t say that. Trust me and have faith
in what I’m saying. The people who tried to ruin my life, I will soon reveal their faces to you. But, but trust me, please. Brother Aslam. Brother Aslam, what are you doing here?
This isn’t even your neighborhood. I had some work. Okay, Brother Aslam, you’re so angry that
you won’t even greet me anymore. Have you people left any space
for peace to be sent your way? Brother Aslam, I feel so ashamed in front of all of you. I wanted to apologize to you, but I couldn’t gather
the courage to face you. By chance, you came
in front of me today, so I thought I’d apologize to you. With folded hands,
I ask for your forgiveness. Whatever Sarfaraz did is unforgivable. Dear Fiza is a very good girl, but I feel so ashamed
in front of her too that I couldn’t even go and apologize to her. How will you ask for forgiveness? And what are you going to apologize for?
Tell me that. Sarfaraz divorced Fiza… If it had just been about the divorce, maybe I could have forgiven you, but now Sarfaraz is after Dua's marriage. He's going around telling
the whole world that he will get Dua divorced from
Ghaznavi and marry her himself. Hey this, how can this even be possible? This is what has happened. Listen carefully, and make your son understand. Otherwise, I might end up killing him, and not even come to apologize to you. Brother Aslam. Mom, we’re just going out for a bit. What’s the problem? Every day, you both get ready
and head out somewhere. You spend the whole day
at the police station, and your wife is locked up in her room. When you come home in the evening, she puts on makeup,
ready to go out again. Is this the way to live
in respectable families? You have two young,
unmarried sisters in your house. Have you any shame? Holding your wife’s hand, off you go. Mom, Sumbul wanted to. I’ll just get her ice cream from somewhere
nearby and be back in half an hour. Is she a child that she just felt
like eating ice cream? And you just went along. Such frivolous things don’t suit
households with young sisters. Explain to her that
she should stay at home, no need to go anywhere. And stop lying around in the room all day,
breaking the bed. From tomorrow,
get involved in the household. Take care of the kitchen,
and cook meals. There’s no need to go out anywhere. Now go wash your hands and face. Sumbul. Sumbul… Put it on here properly, child. Why are you meeting Dua? We are both getting married, what else? Are you listening to what he's saying? Don’t you have any shame at all? What’s shameful about it? We’re getting married, and if she has no issue,
and I don’t either. Then what problem do you people have? I’ve made my decision that I will marry her, and I won’t change my mind. You’re seeing his actions, aren’t you? Did you hear what nonsense
he just spewed about a married woman? You just keep saying
bad things about my son. That girl is encouraging him. That’s the only reason
he’s saying such things. You’re still supporting him? Understand the gravity of the situation! The whole world will condemn us. He won’t marry Dua. I’ll make him understand. And are the girls of that house
the only ones left for my son? I curse those girls, and you’re always against my son. Other people's children
seem good to you, but your own child seems bad. Don’t blame me for this. All of this is the result of
your poor upbringing. If you had raised him well, I wouldn’t have to face
such disgrace in society. He has already ruined one girl’s life and is now set on ruining
another girl’s life. May God ruin these girls. They’ve made a spectacle out of my son. We thought you weren’t
the one contacting him, he was. But today we found out you were. One sister already divorced, and yours is also on the verge
of divorcing you. You people have dragged
my honor through the dirt. You have disgraced me
in front of the whole world. Mom, your tea. Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Sister! The patient’s blood pressure has spiked, and she has suffered a deep shock. We have treated her, but keep her away from
any stressful environment. If her blood pressure spikes again,
it could become a serious problem. Be careful. Yes. Come on, lie down carefully, don’t think about anything. Listen, this is all happening
because of you. Mom has reached this state
only because of you. If anything happens to my mother, I won’t spare you. You’ve caused my divorce, you’ve taken away my child, and now you want
to take my mother too? Until I decide something, you should stay confined to your room, understand? This is all happening because of you. Mom has reached this state
only because of you. If anything happens to my mother, I won’t spare you. Have you sent the things to the lands? The seasons have changed. I had told Jaffar, he must have sent it by now. Tea. No, I’m not in the mood. Nosherwan, what is all this? How long will you continue
to deny what we’re saying? When you already know
and understand that that girl is not sincere with you, then why don’t you leave her? We told you before that girls with good lineage and 
family backgrounds are entirely different. But you married her out of stubbornness. And you’ve placed this stain
on your forehead for no reason. Still, we respected her for
your peace of mind and gave her love, but she turned out to be of
low character and ungrateful. Why don’t you divorce her
and throw her out of your life? I don’t want to talk about this, Baba Saeein. I just need some time. How much more time do you need? The sooner you remove her from your life, the sooner your suffering will end. Enough! I’ve finalized it, you are giving her a divorce. Either verbally divorce her
in front of her family or if you say I can have
the documents drawn up. No, Baba Saeein. I will do whatever that needs to be
done regarding this matter myself. You don’t need to worry. Whatever he is doing is wrong. We are worried about Nosherwan. Just pray that God grants peace to our son. Speak, why did you call me? I think we’re working together. And I called to remind you that
the work hasn’t been completed yet. Get to the point. Has there been any progress
from Dua’s side? Did she call? Keep your nonsense to yourself. Whether she called me or not, I won’t give you any updates
anymore, understood? When it’s time to give money,
you act like you’re giving charity, but you never forget to ask for updates. Don’t contact me anymore, we are no longer working together. Hey, I’ve already told you, that once Dua’s divorce is finalized,
I’ll give you the money. Why are you so greedy? Yes, I’m greedy, but less than you. You better take care of yourself because when Ghaznavi
finds out your true nature, he may not divorce Dua, but he will
definitely divorce you immediately. It’s in your best interest to maintain
good relations with me. I want my money immediately,
transferred to my account. Understood? And by the way,
I’m recording this call, and this recording will
reach Ghaznavi right away. Hey… I don’t need Sarfaraz alive. Don’t worry about the money, you’ll get whatever price you ask for. But this job needs to be done
as quickly as possible. Our Zawar’s bride. If I can take my husband’s life
to get Nosherwan, then what are you Sarfaraz? How much more time do you need? The sooner you remove her from your life, the sooner your suffering will end. Call the lawyer. What? The lawyer? I want to divorce Dua. I… Hey… For…Forgive me, Ma’am. Where are you rushing off to
in such a state of panic? Ma'am, I was just going for
an important task from Sir. What kind of task of Saeein is so urgent
that you’re in such a hurry? Sir asked me to get
the divorce papers signed. Divorce? Yes. Sir is divorcing the younger madam. And you’re telling me this news
like this, in such a state of panic? This should have been shared with 
drums and celebration, Jaffar. Now that you’re going out,
bring back a lot of sweets. I’ll distribute them to everyone. Yes, alright, as you wish. Don’t forget. I’m glad you came when I called. The twists of fate have
brought me to a point where every path leads me back to you. I had to come to you. It made me happy to know this. Anyway, should I bring something from here,
they have self-service, tea or coffee? Whatever you feel is right. They have good coffee. I’ll be back. Just keep Dua trapped in your
web of love like this. Nosherwan Saeein has called
the lawyer and told him to draw up the divorce papers. He is finally giving Dua a divorce. We will succeed in our mission
very soon and you, you will get all of your money. Should I get anything else? No, no, I’m okay. Are you sure? Drink it.
