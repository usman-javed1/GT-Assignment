[24.76] You made me a stranger, right?
[30.56] Why did you not tell me, Fiza, that
[33.04] you had to tolerate
so much because of me?
[38.28] What could I tell you,
[39.60] huh?
[40.44] Dua, you are my sister.
[41.72] Yes, so?
[43.68] You didn’t have to tolerate all this.
[47.40] Why are your in-laws
punishing you for my mistakes?
[50.68] What sort of people are they?
[53.56] You have to tolerate so much.
[55.28] Your child…
[57.68] I am sorry Fiza.
[59.76] I am really sorry.
[62.64] I am the only one responsible for all this.
[65.28] Only me.
[67.40] Just understand...
[68.28] what's there to understand?
[69.96] What has happened
is what's written in destiny.
[72.36] No,
[75.08] this is the ransom for my mistakes that
[77.24] you are paying.
[79.52] Why?
[81.16] You are so good.
[83.76] How can someone do bad with you?
[89.08] I am good,
[91.12] but maybe not that much,
that I can meet their standards.
[94.52] Have you not heard,
[98.12] the true wife is the one with
whom the husband is pleased?
[101.60] No, Fiza. No.
[103.04] You don’t need to tolerate anything.
[104.80] I will go to your in-laws.
[106.28] I will talk to everyone.
[107.76] I will beg them,
[108.88] fall at their feet,
[109.76] and ask for forgiveness.
[110.68] I will tell them that you are not at fault.
[112.68] They should not punish you.
[113.68] Any punishment should be given to me.
[115.12] Every mistake is mine.
[116.32] I am the one to blame.
[116.96] No, you won’t do any of that.
[119.56] Are you so weak that
[121.24] you would go and beg
in front of someone like that?
[123.28] No, my sister is not that weak.
[125.04] If you can do so much for me,
[127.64] I can do everything for you, Fiza.
[131.40] You are such a beloved sister of mine.
[133.36] You are so good.
[134.64] I cannot see anything
like this happening with you.
[136.88] There is no need to do anything,
[139.00] I will deal with it myself,
[140.36] okay?
[141.56] For now,
[142.68] for now, let me enjoy this happiness,
[146.32] that now you can come to us. And
[149.72] whenever I miss you, I can meet you.
[152.60] Forget whatever happened for now.
[154.64] Let me be happy today. Please.
[157.76] Okay?
[159.64] Idiot.
[160.44] You started crying.
[162.52] I am happy. Can you not be happy?
[176.16] You are back from your Mother’s home.
[178.40] Yes.
[181.48] Come here.
[215.96] How long will you stay upset like this?
[219.00] I am not upset.
[224.00] Then what is all this?
[227.44] You are not talking to me,
[228.48] nor do you look at me.
[229.48] What happened to you?
[250.56] Since you have people to talk to,
[254.08] what's the need for me?
[260.32] She is committing suicide for you.
[263.88] Make her yours,
[268.68] she'll be happy, and so will you.
[272.60] Dua, I only love you.
[276.20] Then why do you go to her?
[278.84] Why is she calling you?
[284.68] If she is so important to you,
[286.88] then go to her,
[287.96] make her yours, and leave me.
[289.32] Enough!
[292.64] Just because I love you
[293.60] doesn't mean I'll agree to
everything unreasonable you say.
[301.56] Farah was my past,
[305.20] and you are my present.
[313.60] Is this the extent of your love,
[317.68] that you would doubt my character?
[325.68] Nosherwan Ghaznavi's
character is not so low.
[362.00] Nosherwan is my son
[364.60] and I have brought him up.
[366.84] But, today, you have
become our daughter-in-law,
[369.72] so I am making you understand,
[373.80] that, along with trusting
your husband, blindly, it's also
[380.44] important to keep an
eye on his day-to-day activities.
[386.92] From where did Farah
come into your life again?
[390.20] Baba Saeein,
there is nothing like you think.
[394.28] If there is nothing like that,
[396.72] then why have you been seen
visiting Farah’s home?
[404.84] Farah was my past,
[408.44] and you are my present.
[411.20] Is this the extent of your love,
[415.08] that you would doubt my character?
[418.68] Nosherwan Ghaznavi's
character is not so low.
[459.48] Bano, check who is outside.
[465.28] Bano, check who is outside.
[490.80] You?
[492.48] Yes, me.
[495.12] What is there to be
so surprised about this?
[500.56] What have you come here for?
[507.28] I had to come here after what you are doing.
[512.40] And what exactly am I doing?
[517.88] You are making a failed attempt to ensnare
Ghaznavi in the trap of your fake love.
[524.68] Neither am I a liar nor is love fake.
[528.40] Really?
[530.96] So why were you unfaithful to Ghaznavi
[535.40] and left him to marry someone else?
[541.08] I wasn’t unfaithful, Ghaznavi was.
[544.08] He married Kashmala.
[546.28] Okay,
[549.24] he married Kashmala,
[551.44] so you left him and went.
[553.52] Right.
[555.04] So why did you come now?
[557.64] Now Nosherwan Ghaznavi
doesn’t have one wife, he has two.
[564.60] Even if millions like you come,
[567.36] you still cannot snatch Ghaznavi from me.
[572.92] You are alone.
[575.88] Isn’t Ghaznavi there?
[581.68] Call him.
[583.68] Ask him to come.
[587.40] Just like you beg and plead to see him,
[593.28] plead again.
[595.64] Maybe he'll take pity and come.
[600.12] At least this way,
[602.72] you'll maintain your delusion
[605.84] that he loves you.
[609.28] Girls like you need to beg.
[620.28] A filthy flower that Ghaznavi has
made the flower of his collar.
[626.72] This is my good fortune
[630.68] that he has chosen me.
[642.44] Those who fade from the heart,
find a place in it.
[646.96] I understand your pain.
[648.88] You better stay within your limits.
[650.48] I don’t need to stay within my limits, you do.
[657.24] Those who couldn't make their own home
[659.08] can't bear to see someone else making theirs.
[662.64] So right.
[666.48] I will not let you make your home.
[668.80] I will rest when I get you out of Ghaznavi’s life.
[672.32] You've already tried so hard.
[675.20] If there's still a desire left,
[676.80] try once more.
[679.12] Get out.
[681.48] Get out of here.
[684.80] I really like seeing this envy of yours.
[691.12] Ghaznavi has confessed in front of me that
[693.16] he doesn’t love you.
[695.32] No one understands this better than me.
[698.52] If you understood it, then also accept it.
[703.88] The sooner you accept it,
[705.20] the more peace you will find.
[710.96] What if you lose your mind?
[716.72] Neither have I lost nor will I ever lose.
[719.28] Do you hear that?
[728.04] The sooner you accept it,
[729.48] the more peace you will find.
[731.00] What if you lose your mind?
[743.88] What to do?
[751.80] Pick up my phone.
[756.96] Pick up my phone.
[766.72] Ghaznavi, answer my phone!
[776.64] What to do now?
[779.56] What to do? What to do?
[845.16] I really like seeing
this envy of yours.
[848.96] Ghaznavi has confessed
in front of me that
[850.88] he doesn’t love you.
[853.08] No one understands this better than me.
[856.28] If you understood it, then also accept it.
[861.52] The sooner you accept it,
[862.92] the more peace you will find.
[867.84] What if you lose your mind?
[941.08] What did you do?
[942.84] You have fixed the wedding for so soon?
[946.52] This is not a wedding of dolls.
[949.64] Sumbul is our daughter.
[951.92] I am worried about
how everything will be done so soon.
[958.20] Hey…
[959.16] Thank you, child.
[960.72] Don’t worry,
[962.00] everything will get done.
[966.24] But how will it get done?
[968.88] Mama is right.
[970.60] We have very little time.
[972.56] Hey, Hassam has said that
[974.52] he doesn’t need dowry of any kind.
[977.40] We should just send Sumbul with them,
[980.88] that is enough.
[987.80] Okay, it is really good that
[990.00] they are refusing to take dowry. But
[992.16] despite that,
[993.08] we cannot send her away
empty-handed like this.
[996.68] Sarfaraz is right.
[998.84] Even if they have
lived abroad all their life
[1001.24] and they will also take
Sumbul along with them,
[1003.20] they are still human.
[1008.96] What if,
[1010.40] after going there
[1012.72] they taunt my daughter
for not bringing anything,
[1015.00] then?
[1018.88] What is this?
[1020.40] Such a light set.
[1021.64] thin like a feather.
[1023.32] We didn’t ask your
parents for anything,
[1026.48] but they crossed all limits.
[1033.56] Did you just bring this or
is there something else too?
[1037.24] Huh?
[1039.76] That’s all there is.
[1041.16] What was the need for this, even?
[1043.32] They should have married
off their daughter in one dress.
[1049.60] Hey, even I understand
these worldly affairs.
[1053.84] Instead of spending on dowry items,
[1057.96] we'll give her the cash directly.
[1060.04] She can buy whatever
she wants when she gets there.
[1064.00] Yes, this is fine.
[1069.96] Fine, then.
[1073.32] Sumbul and I will go for
the clothes shopping.
[1082.28] Rest,
[1083.68] you people take care of the food
and hall arrangements.
[1088.36] Hey, you don’t need to
worry about the hall.
[1091.24] Sarfaraz and I will take care
of all those arrangements.
[1098.64] You just do one thing,
[1100.96] take Sumbul along with you.
[1102.64] Buy whatever clothes you
want to get from the market.
[1107.48] Also, take daughter Fiza along.
[1111.04] Also, get something for her.
[1121.04] No, I have clothes.
[1125.12] Child,
[1126.04] everyone has clothes,
[1128.16] but you are our daughter-in-law
[1130.20] and it is the occasion of the wedding
[1131.16] and you too should have
some new clothes.
[1133.84] I will give you money.
[1135.72] You go along
[1136.76] and get something that you like.
[1139.56] Okay.
[1143.36] Okay, where is Sumbul?
[1145.20] She is in her room.
[1146.68] She was saying she had a headache.
[1148.72] Hey,
[1149.48] you should have told me earlier.
[1150.40] If she is not well,
[1151.88] we will take her to the doctor.
[1153.52] No. No.
[1154.68] Once she has tea, she will be fine.
[1157.44] Do one thing,
[1159.12] make tea and take it to her room,
[1161.56] and along with it give her
a tablet for the headache.
[1165.60] Sure.
[1166.48] Yes, see.
[1167.80] If we need to take her to the doctor,
[1169.84] I will take her.
[1171.48] Ask her.
[1173.16] Okay.
[1192.40] There must be some valid
reason for your refusal, right?
[1196.00] The only reason is that
[1197.60] I don’t want to get married right now, and
[1199.72] I don’t want to go that far away.
[1203.68] This is not that big of a reason.
[1206.08] No one will agree.
[1209.36] Look Sumbul,
[1211.20] you can talk about anything to me.
[1215.60] Say whatever is in your heart.
[1218.40] You can trust me.
[1228.64] Here, take the medication.
[1230.00] What happened? Are you really unwell?
[1234.36] I am alive.
[1237.64] Why are you saying this?
[1240.56] If you are really unwell, then
[1242.28] we will go to the hospital.
[1246.20] I am really heartbroken, sister-in-law.
[1249.40] Why are you saying this?
[1252.00] Did you not look at Fahad
properly out of shyness?
[1254.76] He is so good-looking.
[1255.52] I was thinking you must be really happy.
[1263.68] Every girl doesn’t have such a good fate.
[1269.60] Such a good boy. Home.
[1273.76] Everyone doesn’t get
everything together.
[1278.16] I’ve never been one of those girls
[1280.68] who sigh over relationships from abroad.
[1284.28] Yes, I know this.
[1286.40] But it is also possible that
[1288.64] the one you marry,
[1290.28] they get a chance to
go abroad after marriage.
[1293.48] Even then you have to go
along with them, right?
[1296.52] If you marry the person you like,
[1300.20] you can be happy even in the jungle.
[1304.20] A person you like?
[1308.84] Sumbul,
[1310.20] did I correctly hear what you are saying?
[1327.16] I like someone, sister-in-law.
[1331.72] So, does anyone at home know this?
[1340.68] I am only telling you.
[1344.12] You should have told us about this.
[1348.28] I thought there was time
for me to get married.
[1350.72] I will tell everyone
when the time is right.
[1352.56] But this proposal came suddenly.
[1359.20] It’s really stressful, and
[1361.80] now that the wedding
date is suddenly set,
[1367.96] what will you do?
[1371.72] I don’t know anything.
[1372.72] My head is exploding
thinking about this.
[1374.60] Okay. Okay. You please don’t worry,
[1377.00] okay?
[1378.04] We will think of something.
[1380.32] First tell me, who is the boy?
[1382.52] Where did you meet him?
[1383.36] And is he even serious
about marriage or not?
[1387.04] Khizar.
[1387.84] Khizar is a police inspector.
[1392.16] We became friends
at my college function.
[1399.36] He is a really good boy, sister-in-law.
[1401.20] He is really serious about me.
[1403.80] The proposal seems satisfactory
according to what you have told me.
[1412.40] I don’t think we will find
a reason to reject him.
[1416.56] Tell him to bring his family tomorrow.
[1420.40] That’s the issue.
[1421.68] He cannot send the proposal right now.
[1423.96] What does this mean?
[1425.28] If he is serious about marrying you,
[1428.40] then why can he not send the proposal?
[1430.24] Khizar has two elder sisters,
[1431.72] who are unmarried.
[1433.48] He cannot talk about his marriage.
[1437.52] And did you tell him about
your wedding date getting fixed?
[1446.00] What was his reaction?
[1449.60] He is really worried.
[1451.56] He is constantly saying that
[1453.16] I should say no to this proposal.
[1456.04] This way it will get really late Sumbul.
[1464.68] And who knows,
[1467.56] tomorrow you might be waiting for him,
[1470.36] and in the end, all you
are left with is just the wait.
[1474.48] I don’t understand anything, sister-in-law.
[1481.64] Sister-in-law,
[1483.24] you come with me.
[1484.68] Meet Khizar once.
[1486.28] If you make Khizar understand,
[1487.84] he will understand.
[1490.12] Please
[1492.12] Me?
[1494.52] Sister-in-law,
I cannot be brave like you.
[1500.20] Like you, I cannot marry
a person I don’t know.
[1507.68] What do you think?
[1509.76] Do I not see
[1511.32] how Brother rebukes you?
[1517.20] He scolds on small things.
[1521.56] He doesn’t care for you at all.
[1525.44] No, sister-in-law,
[1527.28] I cannot marry someone
who I don’t know,
[1531.04] and neither do I love.
[1534.64] Khizar and I really love each other.
[1543.72] And we?
[1545.08] We will stay really happy with each other.
[1553.16] Please, sister-in-law,
[1554.64] don’t say no.
[1561.08] Help me. Please, sister-in-law.
[1573.48] Okay, you take the medicine.
[1575.40] We will think something about this.
[1606.16] Since you have people to talk to,
[1608.76] what’s the need for me?
[1610.68] She is committing suicide for you.
[1614.36] Make her yours,
[1618.40] she’ll be happy, and so will you.
[1622.28] Dua, I only love you.
[1626.04] Then why do you go to her?
[1628.56] Why is she calling you?
[1632.72] If she is so important to you,
[1634.88] then go to her,
[1636.12] make her yours, and leave me.
[1637.32] Enough!
[1645.68] I am sorry.
[1648.68] There is no need for that.
[1652.96] Then?
[1656.16] Then what?
[1661.92] Won’t you forgive me?
[1669.44] You have not done anything
[1672.80] you need to apologize for.
[1678.96] No,
[1681.24] I said a lot of useless things.
[1684.28] Hah.
[1687.28] When are you useless?
[1690.56] I am useless in your eyes.
[1693.20] The ones who make claims
of love are not that weak.
[1696.44] That’s not how it is.
[1697.48] Then how is it?
[1711.92] You said that
[1715.28] you wouldn’t have
any connection with Farah,
[1724.24] but still,
[1725.12] you kept going to her house repeatedly.
[1728.72] I felt that…
[1729.48] That I love her even today.
[1735.64] I want to make her mine, right?
[1738.28] That’s what you felt, right?
[1748.20] If this is the case,
[1752.32] then who can stop me?
[1760.60] I admit that I am helpless in your matter.
[1765.76] I love you very much
[1768.12] and can’t live without you.
[1779.28] But if you don’t want to be with me,
[1784.92] then you are free to go.
[1878.72] Madam, should I serve food?
[1882.92] Madam.
[1885.00] Madam.
[1887.84] Madam.
[1891.88] Madam.
[1896.56] Oh.
[1906.72] I’m scared.
[1908.44] If tomorrow
[1910.16] you end up leaving me either because you’ve
grown tired of me or due to some pressure,
[1916.84] then I might end up going back to Zunaira.
[1919.96] I would want you not to
take Zunaira’s name again.
[1927.72] Consider your past as
a bad dream and forget it.
[1932.88] Your companionship
[1935.24] is a beautiful dream for me,
[1939.84] but still I have a fear.
[1943.76] Why? Don’t you have faith in me?
[1945.68] I do.
[1946.72] I have a lot of faith in you.
[1950.20] But I am scared of my fate.
[1960.36] You are really weird.
[1963.20] What do you mean?
[1965.96] Meaning…weird.
[1970.84] At times I don’t understand
[1973.32] if I should respect you
more or love you more.
[1977.68] Whatever you feel like.
[1982.68] I promise,
[1985.12] neither of the two will ever get reduced.
