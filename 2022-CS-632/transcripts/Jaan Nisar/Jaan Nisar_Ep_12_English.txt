Where are you going? Come we will drop you. 
Come on. What are you thinking? Come on. Come on.
 Where are you going? Wait. Listen to me. Hey, why are you worried? Come on, we are good people. Come. Hey, what happened? 
Come on. Come, sit. I think these boys are bothering her. 
Go, save her. Come on. Come with us. 
Sit in the car. Come on. What? Move back. Please, save me. Those boys…
Yes. Yes. Yes. They ran because of the gunshot. They will come again. 
Please, save me. Please. Relax. Till we are with you, 
no one will say anything to you. Anyway, don’t worry. Tell me what were you doing here, 
so late at night, in this condition? And who were those two? I don’t know. I know nothing. 
I was there, they had come after me. I didn’t know who they were.
I don’t… Okay, fine. 
Don’t worry. Where is your home? 
Come, we will drop you. My….my home. Yes, your home. I don’t have a home. You don’t have a home? No problem. You come and stay at my home. No, I will go. I will go somewhere. I… Where will you go 
on this dark night? If you go around like this 
on secluded streets alone, then such cheap boys will run after you. How long will you save 
yourself from them? Come with me. Why are you crying? Hey, cowards cry, and you look really brave to me. Hmm? You come to my home with me. There is no one other than me 
and my daughters at my home. You don’t leave me and go. You stay here. 
That’s why I am saying, you come to my home. I am sure you will live comfortably there. Child, I have to go. My daughters are waiting 
for me at my home. If you don’t want to go with me, 
then no issue. I will not force you. But, reach a safe location
 as soon as possible. I will be worried for you. Okay, how long can I stand here with you? You are really beautiful, 
extremely good-looking, and wolves come out on the streets
like this in the dark of the night. Okay? Take care of yourself.
Come on, Hasan. No, please, I will go with you to your home. Thank God. At least this sensible decision of 
yours saved me from ruining my sleep. Come on, come. Sit. Fehmida Begum, she didn’t die. She ruined our respect and left. Now, whose funeral are you mourning? For God’s sake, Mr. Aslam, don’t say such hurtful words. A girl who has never 
stayed out of the house, who has never spent 
a night away from home, where all could she be wandering? I'm fed up with listening to your talks. Girls who don't respect their parents, this is what happens to them. Please, have some consideration. She's a young girl. Who knows where she might be? Did she consider her father’s respect? Hey, she can die or go anywhere, I don’t care. For God’s sake, Mr. Aslam, have some mercy. Have some mercy on my motherhood. Hey, for God’s sake, find my daughter 
and bring her home. Hey, you are talking 
about her entry into this home. I won’t even let her funeral 
come into this home. Fehmida, if you take that girl’s name then you will see the worst in me. If you want to cry for her, then go. Go out of the room. 
Go out and cry for her. Hey, come. Come. 
Don’t be scared. Come inside. This is my humble abode, and my daughters live 
with me in this home. And you too are like them for me. Okay? Hello, Mama. 
Hello, child. Hello, Mama. Hello, child. Did you people have food? Yes, we were waiting for you, 
we just ate a little while back. Okay, good. How was your party? Yes, it was so good. Who is this that you brought with you? Hey, I haven't even asked you for your name. What is your name? Dua. Dua? It is a really pretty name. This is Dua, and I met her on the way. Some goon was bothering her. Coincidentally, she came 
in front of our car, so I didn’t find it reasonable 
to leave her on the way, so I brought her along with me. So, today, Dua is our guest, 
and tomorrow morning she can go wherever she wants. Did you eat food? Hey, how will she eat? Does someone serve food on the street? Okay, listen, Roomi. Child, ask the servant to serve 
food for Dua, quickly. I will ask them. Have it, child. Start eating. Hey, child. Eat it. Here you go. By the way, the girl is really pretty. How did you trap her? You know, what they say is right. Girls lost in love and romance 
end up nowhere. Now what would she know how big 
of a price you took for her? Okay yes, this is her glass, don’t forget. I feel dizzy. I have to go home. When I am with you, then you never have to worry. Dua. Child, your clothes look very dirty. Roomi, you give her your clothes. Child, you shower and change them. No need for the formality, 
I am fine. Hey, child, what is the formality in this? Roomi is my daughter, and you too 
are like my daughter. I won’t ask you what you were doing 
on the streets so late at night nor will I pressurize you that you tell me anything 
about your family. But, I do understand that you are really worried and if you ever feel like resting 
your head on someone's shoulder and crying to lighten your heart, my shoulder is here for you. Child, if not as your mother, you can at least 
consider me like your mother. Thank you. Roomi, you take Dua to your room. She will stay in your room, tonight. Child, the driver will drop you 
where you want in the morning. And yes, Dua shouldn’t suffer from anything. You said it, it won’t happen. Come on, child. Now you rest. You seem to be awake for a lot of hours. Okay? Shall we go? Hey, why did you stop? Come inside. This… Is this your room? Yes, and from today, it is yours as well. After all, you will share the room with me, so it belongs to you too. Hmmm. Mama has a really good heart. If you have any problem, then you can share it with her. In fact, if you want to stay here forever, then she will even accept this and get a room even more beautiful 
than this compared to this. Your Mama is really very good. Had I not come in front of her car, God knows what would have 
happened with me, today. Now you have come here, right? So you don’t have to be scared 
of anyone with Mama there. I will come in a minute. Here you go. Go and change and fix yourself. No, how can I take this? What are you saying? 
Here, go and change. The washroom is on the
 right side over here. I will take this call. Hello. Yes, hi. Oh wow, you look really good in these clothes. Why are you crying? I was missing my family. Look, you can discuss whatever 
your problem is with me. Now, we are friends, right? Okay, if not me, then at least discuss it with Mama. She will solve all your problems. Take your time. Okay? You rest, I will go say goodnight to Mama. Okay? God has been really kind, my son’s life has been saved. Now, we will do charity 
after going to the mansion, so that every trouble always 
stays away from you. Take care of yourself, son. You people are leaving really soon. We don’t want to leave you and go, but the children are alone in the mansion. They must be getting worried. No, so I will have the children called here. No son, it will disturb their school. And after all, we are leaving Kashmala with you, to take care of you. No, there is no need for that. Jaffar is here to take care of you. Idiot. A wife is a wife. And no one can care for you 
more than a wife. But the children need their mother, so this is also not right. The children are really attached to me
and your Baba Saeein. Don’t worry. They will be really happy with us. Mama, I am telling you, there are other servants too, 
to take care of me, so… Don’t argue so much, son. Your Amma Saeein is leaving 
Kashmala for your betterment. When Kasmala stays here, then we too will find solace from your side. Sure. We should leave. Kashmala. 
Yes, Amma Saeein. You have to take a lot of care 
of our Nosherwan, there should be no mistake. You don’t worry, Amma Saeein. He is the king of my head. I will take care of him. You won't hear a complaint. We will go. Take lots of care of yourself too. 
Yes. Live long. Okay son, goodbye. Come. 
Come. I wanted to say something to you. Go ahead. No one has come from my home, and I can't go there right now. So? If you would have let me talk to 
my family with your phone… What do you want to talk about? I just wanted to know if everything is fine. Everyone would be worried for Dua, so I thought I would ask if they found out 
something about her or not. Okay. So, you feel that you will find out 
about your sister, and the one who ran away from home, 
she will come back? I just wanted to know 
the condition of the home. No need to talk to anyone about anything. Talk at the reception in the evening. After all, I am thinking I will talk to Mama and Papa, and we should end this story. Where are you going?
Come we will drop you. Come on. What are you thinking? Wait. Listen to me. Hey, why are you worried? Come on, we are good people. What happened? Did you get scared in your sleep? I am fine. Did you have a bad dream? Maybe. No. I… Okay, if you are awake, 
then freshen up. Everyone must be waiting 
for us over breakfast. Breakfast? At this hour? Yes. I agree it is 12 noon, but this is the time we wake up. At times, we even wake up later than this. Okay. Don’t you people go to 
university or college? We have studied as much as we had to. Okay, hurry up. We will talk about 
the rest over breakfast. Will you wait for a little while? Then we will go together. I don’t know the way around here. This is our home, not a carnival that you are afraid 
of the feeling of getting lost. It's a strange place, and one feels fear in unfamiliar 
surroundings. You get ready. I will come to get you. And yes, I picked this dress for you, wear it. This? No, no, this is absolutely fine. These are good clothes. This way, all your clothes will get dirty. I am fine with these. 
I will continue to wear them. Dua, mama stays really up to date, and she wants us too 
remain tip-top like her. If she sees you in this dressing 
then I will get scolded, that I didn’t care for the guest,
 this and that. That’s why, listen to me, get up, change, get ready 
and please come out. Why do you want me to get scolded, man. Come quickly. Okay. Okay. Good girl. I love you a lot. I want you to just stay with me, Dua. What are you doing here? You were talking in your sleep, so… Hmm? I don’t know. Younger Saeein. You go from here, I have to talk 
to Jaffar about something. Talk in front of me. What is it that you cannot 
talk about in front of me? Do, as I tell you to do. Leave from here. Jaffar. Greetings Saeein. Greetings. Is there some worry, Jaffar? Err… Is Dua, fine? I don’t know anything, Saeein. What does this mean? Saeein, she is missing and we have no news of where she is. Jaffar, what does this mean? Saeein, I tried hard to find her. Saeein, I feel something wrong 
has surely happened with her. But, Saeein, I cannot say anything without confirming. Jaffar, nothing should happen to Dua. What happened, Saeein? I am fine. You have half an hour, find her. Yes, Saeein, as you order. Why don’t you listen to me, what is the need to do this event?
 Cancel it. Why are you arguing uselessly 
with me for so long? I am not arguing, 
I am telling you the truth. People didn’t find out 
on the wedding day that my Sister-in-law ran away from home. But is it necessary that we do 
this reception and inform them? He is right. 
Hey, who will tell them? No one in our entire family knows Mr. Aslam and neither does anyone know 
if they have two daughters or three. After all, Dua was not present 
on the day of the wedding, so from where will her mention 
come from now? Such things don’t remain hidden, Mr. Nazir. My tailor called. She was telling me that 
Dua had returned home. Okay, thank God she had come back home, she didn’t have any accident. The ones who have accidents, they die. They don’t go to the police station first
and then back to the home. Mr. Aslam would surely know 
that his daughter did something. That’s why he closed the door on her face, he didn’t let her enter the home. Do you hear that? He is hiding his face 
because of his daughter and we go around celebrating 
the reception of his other daughter? Wow, Mr. Nazir, you surprise me. Hey, if you are surprised, 
then so be it. I will surely organize my son’s reception,
 understand? It would be better
 if you start your preparation. Child, you have no fault in all that has happened. But I will not let any injustice
be done to you. Sumbul. Yes, papa?
Come here, child. Child, take your Sister-in-law 
to her room and take care of her. Fiza, child, you too must think that God knows what home I have come to. But don’t worry, 
God will make it all fine. Go, child. Yes, papa. Sister-in-law. Let’s go. You must think. We have lost our sleep because of her. You were the one who was so interested 
in getting me married. Is this how you have repaid me 
for my obedience? How was I to know that these bitter almonds 
will come in our share? It would have been better had 
I eloped and gotten married. Huh? What news did you bring, Jaffar? Saeein, the news is really bad. What is the matter, Jaffar? 
Tell me, clearly. Saeein, I had kept a close watch, but…
