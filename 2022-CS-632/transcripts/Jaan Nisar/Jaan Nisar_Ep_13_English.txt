Sir, I did keep a high security, but… I told you nothing should 
happen to her, Jaffar, then how? Sir, I forgot everything 
because of the attack on you. All this happened in a night, sir. Jaffar, I can even kill you for your mistake, you do know that, right? I can sacrifice my hundred lives 
for you, Sir. I have made a mistake, Sir, and a huge mistake, Sir. Jaffar, go away from here, go away. Hmm, are you relaxed now? Yes, you all took very good care of me, thank you. Why are you talking like strangers? You have come very close
 to us in a few hours. Anyway, tell me, 
where do you want to go? The driver will drop you off. I don’t have a home. You don’t have a home? I mean if you don’t have any family, there must be some relatives 
that you used to live with. I don’t even have a relative. So then where will you go? You are beautiful and young, how will you stay safe on the streets? That is what I was thinking too. Anyway, there is no need to worry. If you don’t have a home, my home is here, live here, my daughters live here as well, and you live here like my daughter too. No one will push you out of here. You have done so many favors for me. You saved my honor, brought me to your home, 
gave me so much respect, and loved me so much, I am very grateful to you. What are you saying? No, seriously, if I live here, I will keep 
on looking for some job, once I get a job, I will leave, I won’t be a burden on you. Girls live in a hostel too, right? Yes, they do, I really like your self-respect, really liked it. I have a few good 
businessmen in my circle, if you may allow, shall I talk to them about your job? Really? Please talk to them if this is possible. Okay then, consider your job done. Rumi, this is your dress, right? Yes, that’s the one. Look, what a beauty in such simplicity. My child, have it. Yes. Yeah, please have something. Mom, mom, it’s sister’s wedding reception today, she must be alone there, none of us went to ask how she is doing. God knows what her in-laws 
must be thinking. Due to Dua’s grief, I totally forgot about poor Fiza. It was the first wedding in our house, we got her married in such a sad state. Fiza was so sad. But we will attend the wedding 
reception, right? I don’t like anything without Dua now. Mom, what is sister’s fault in it? You are right, God knows what she must be 
hearing from her in-laws. Give me your clothes and Dad’s, 
I will iron them. No one will go anywhere. What are you saying, Mr. Aslam? I am right. I have been hiding my face
 from the entire world, I have been hiding my face and you are asking me to go 
in front of the world, face them. Fiza is our daughter by blood. How can we do this to her? Did our daughter care about us? They brought shame 
to us in the whole world. Whatever happened to Dua, it’s not their fault, 
don’t blame them for it. It's all your fault, it's all your fault, I kept on telling 
you don’t give birth to the girls, don’t birth to the girls. If I had a son today, I wouldn’t have to see this day today. If you and your daughter 
are so looking forward to attending the wedding reception,
 then you guys go, I am not coming along. One of them got married 
without the groom and family, and now if you want the second one to also get ruined and 
come back here the very next day of her wedding, so then fine, why don’t you do one thing, bring some poison for both of us as well, so you can get rid of all of us for once. What is this that you… Still, no one knows who she went with, we have just gotten a report that she was taken to the police station 
after the apartment was raided. I couldn’t even find out 
how she got there. Why do some stories have 
so much suffering in their fate? What happened? Hey, listen, tell me what is this way 
your son is behaving? Tell him to sit in one place 
with the daughter-in-law. He dressed up as a groom and 
is sitting here because you asked him to, isn’t that enough? I was against this event myself. Your daughter-in-law and her family 
do not deserve this respect. What? What? Greetings. Greetings, greetings. Did you guys just come? 
We were desperately waiting for you. It’s just… We had to introduce you to people. Yeah? You look so beautiful, sister. But this tension on your face 
doesn’t look nice at all. Stop worrying about me, 
I am worried for you guys. Tell me, any news on Dua? 
Did she come home? Sister did come home but 
Dad didn’t let her enter in the house and she was crying a lot. Did you ask her where she went? We would have only got a chance 
to ask anything had Dad opened the gate. Sister was continuously 
requesting on the door to let her come in and listen to her but Dad, he got so stone-hearted. Mom, didn’t Mom let Dua come inside?
 Didn’t she even try? Mom tried but Dad threatened Mom that if she opened the gate and 
if sister came in, he would divorce her. My lovely Mom. Control yourself. No one even asked 
how I am, Sania. Control yourself, everyone is watching you 
what will they think? Dua. Sania… Control yourself. Kausar, what are you doing? 
People are sitting here. Don’t make me realize 
that people are here, at least let me ask them what my son ever did to them. For what have they taken revenge on him? Why did they spoil my son’s wedding day? Sister, if you know anything about this, please do us a favor 
and end this topic here. All the people that are sitting here 
don’t know much about this. Why? Let them find out. They should also know what a fraud you guys have done with us. Hey, we didn’t do any fraud. What did we demand from you guys? We didn’t even take a needle 
in the name of dowry, and you guys took such 
advantage of our decency? That you got your publicly 
disgraced daughter to our home? Sister, no, our Fiza’s character is clean. She will prove to be a very good 
daughter-in-law for you, trust me. We don’t need such a daughter-in-law that will bring disgrace with her. The younger sister ran away, now let’s see what the elder one does, God knows what will she do 
after coming to this house. Hey? 
Shut up, let’s go from here. 
Why should I shut up? Let them hear what liars they are. They were telling us that the daughter was not well, she was at home, and what do we know 
she ran away from the back. Now we have this daughter at our home, their elder daughter, 
now let’s see if she can stay home or not, 
will she run away from our home as well? Be quiet! You guys please sit. Son, get them seated. You come with me. Why? Let me talk to them.
I am asking you to come. Take her. Son? See? Now you guys stay. I kept on telling you 
mother and daughter that I have just a little bit of honor left, don’t destroy it, but you guys don’t listen to anyone,
now tolerate it, you guys stay here, I am leaving. Mr. Aslam, stay, how will both of us come back at night? Dua, you are sitting here and 
I was looking for you inside. I just came for open air. Dua, are you crying? No, I guess something went in my eye. If there is a problem 
you can share it with me, Dua. May I use your phone? Umm, phone? I will just make a small call, please. Hey, I was just generally asking. You may call. Thank you. Rumi, if you don’t mind, I want to talk alone. No problem. You go ahead, I will leave. Are you going somewhere? Yes, I am going to a party
 at Mr. Hashim’s, you should come too, 
what will you do at home? I am not in the mood, 
his parties are very boring. By the way, you have a lot of attitude. Where is Dua? She has taken my phone, she was saying that she needs 
to make an important call. And you gave her your phone. Yeah, so I couldn’t have refused. By the way, Mom, 
we don’t know who she is, or where she is from, you shouldn’t have just 
brought her here like this. We don’t know what were her 
intentions when she left home, she can be dangerous to us. She is saying she has no one. And you think she is 
telling you the truth? I have my doubts too. Listen, why did you give her your phone? You should have heard who she is 
talking to and what she is talking about. I tried, but she is very clever, she said she wanted to 
talk alone so I should leave. And you left? You should have secretly listened. Relax, Mom, I have turned on 
call recording in my phone, every incoming and 
outgoing call will be recorded, let her talk to anyone she wants to. Hmm, smart, very smart. Okay, bye. 
Bye. Hello. How are you? Dua? 
Yes, the same Dua who you looted in the name of 
love for your wrong intentions and then put a price on her and 
threw her in this ditch. You cannot even imagine, you pathetic man, how much 
did I lose because of you. I lost everything, my everything, my parents, my sisters and everything. I feel disgusted when I think 
that I trusted a person like you. Look, you are having a misunderstanding, I am not who you think I am. People must be thinking 
you are very noble, but have you ever thought when I will yell and tell them 
what you have done to me, what will they think about you? You won’t be left with anything, anything at all. If I want, I can get you 
arrested by the police, did you hear me? After all, what happened to you? That is why my heart was 
constantly worried for you. That dream I had, wasn’t a lie. I wish I could go back in time. Sir? Jaffar, before I lose my cool, leave. Umm, sir, I had no idea. Leave! Okay, sir. Did you see? Did you see it? That is why, I was saying, that is why I was saying that don’t go. But you guys forcefully took me. I wouldn’t have gone there my whole life. Now bear the humiliation. It was our daughter’s wedding reception, how wouldn’t we go? Mr. Aslam, I am a mother and I was thinking as a mother. What did you achieve by going? We just got humiliated. Hey, you just care about your own self. Just think about Fiza, did you hear the words 
sister Kausar was using? You heard it right? The one who said so much to us, just think what she must 
have said to our daughter. You have to listen to the world 
because of your doings. One daughter ran away and 
brought disgrace to me, the second one’s in-laws are 
humiliating us and letting us out. Listen to one thing, I have no relation with your daughters and their in-laws from now onwards. It’s over. What are you saying? What kind of a fate 
my daughters are born with? Happiness runs away from them. Dua, hey, Dua, what have you done? 
What have you done? Your sisters have to go through 
so much because of you. If not about yourself, at least 
you should have thought about your sisters. Hmm. I am so sorry to hear about your story. Your family shouldn’t have done this to you. I admit, that we lose control of ourselves 
when we are young, such small mistakes do happen, but they should have at least heard you. I trusted a stranger and committed a crime
by falling in love with him, how could they forgive me and 
open the doors of their house for me? What if your own family 
closed the doors on you, the doors of this house will 
always be open for you. Don’t worry. Dua, you live here comfortably, I can understand, you feel light just by recalling 
the memories of your family. Okay, give me the name 
and number of that boy. I will teach him such a lesson that he will get on his knees 
and apologize to you. No, no, I don’t want to look back at my past, I don’t even want to think about my past. He, whatever he did to me, it was wrong, very wrong but I went there myself. I shouldn’t have gone. Okay, if you don’t want to tell me anything
about that boy, that’s not a problem, but don’t ever cry again. And tell me what have you decided for the future? I mean how will you live such a long life 
without your family, all alone? I don’t know. But going back to my family, at their door, I don’t want to hurt them. I, I won’t be a burden on you as well. I will do a job. That’s good that you want to forget the bitter 
memories of your past and move on, it will be better if you stay busy. It will be great if you do a job. I mean, I told you I have a few people in my circle, 
good, big businessmen, I have spoken to them about your job, 
just stay ready for the interview. I will arrange a meeting for you soon. Really? 
Yes. What did you think of your mama? Big and respectable people 
of this city, respect me. I, I will forever be grateful to you, 
this will be another favor on me from you. Uff ho, what’s a favor in it? just consider your job done. Always stay happy. The same Dua who you looted in the name of love 
for your wrong intentions and then put a price on her 
and threw her in this ditch. You cannot even imagine, you pathetic man how much 
did I lose because of you. I lost everything, my everything, I feel disgusted when I think 
that I trusted a person like you. People must be thinking 
you are very noble, but have you ever thought when I will yell and tell them 
what you have done to me, what will they think about you? I can get you arrested by the police, did you hear me? Why are you getting so mad at me? Look, whatever happened is not my fault. Yes, you are not at fault, 
it’s my fault, my parents got me married 
in such a family. Don’t say that. Sania was saying that Dad didn’t give a chance Dua 
to say anything, otherwise, she may be innocent. And she might have been in trouble. I know my sister very well, and my heart says the same, yes, she had a very liberal mindset but she wasn’t the kind 
who would run with some boy. Okay, are you done giving a speech 
about your sister? Give a little attention 
to your husband as well, try to get to know him as well. And let me clear one thing to you, I don’t like talking about 
your sister very much. To be honest, a girl whose character is not very good, if you will defend her, your character
 will be questioned too. What are you saying? I am your wife. That’s why I am telling you, don’t talk about her in front of me. One quest… 
Enough! I am embarrassed, Sir, I couldn’t fulfill my responsibility properly. You have embarrassed 
my trust in you, Jaffar. What did I ask from you?
 Just her safety. You couldn’t even do that. I apologize. You cannot be forgiven, you won’t be forgiven till Dua is found. Sir, the inspector is here to meet you. I am coming. Okay. Sir, inspector?
Is everything all right? You can be careless Jaffar, not me. Now, until Dua is not found, I won’t sit in peace! greetings. Greetings. Greetings, sister-in-law, come sit. Wait. Come sit here with me. Brother, shall I give you tea? Greetings, uncle. Greetings, my child. Have something. Okay. The wedding reception has passed, now stop being a bride and 
know about the house. What? Yes. and the way you tail your husband 
out of the room, this won’t happen from tomorrow. Do you understand? I, I will be careful from tomorrow. You will have to be careful. Listen, the bride has just come home, 
let her stay comfortably for a few days. Really? So, then you tell me, after how many months should I 
give this responsibility to her? I am not talking about months, I am talking about a few days, do you understand? Let her stay comfortably for a few days. And Sarfaraz, do one thing, 
have breakfast, and then take daughter-in-law
 to her parent’s house. Usually, girls go to their home 
after the wedding, sit with their family, 
talk and lighten their hearts. The burden is on our chests, until when will we bear this burden? Will you stay quiet for a while or not? Sarfaraz? Did you hear me? Yes, I did. I will take her. My child, have breakfast then get ready to go to your house, Sarfaraz will pick you back in the evening.
