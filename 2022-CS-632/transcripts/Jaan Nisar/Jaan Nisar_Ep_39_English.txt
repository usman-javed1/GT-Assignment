Hopefully, you believe now that I didn't know Khizar before today and hadn't met him previously. So? Your misunderstanding
must be cleared up by now. Yes, it is cleared. But if you think I am feeling guilty and I will apologize to you, then there is nothing like that. Because you are still
a criminal in my eyes. You went to meet another
man without my permission, and Sumbul’s rebellion is also because of you. And even after seeing everything, you think the same, then what can I say? Don’t say anything because what you saw today was a trailer, and in the future, if you try and have an affair with some man, then remember this trailer. And also understand,
it will be far worse than this. I had no idea your brother would turn out to
be such an ignorant person. He grabbed an on-duty officer by the collar. I was on patrol. I swear to God,
if I had stayed a bit longer, I would have lost my job. It was only because
you insisted so much that I came to meet
sister-in-law at the restaurant. We are all very embarrassed as well. I feel sorry for your sister-in-law. How is she living her life with this animal? Poor sister-in-law is actually very good. He humiliates my poor
sister-in-law all the time. Then, make him understand to act humanely. He doesn’t listen to anyone. He just does what he wants. If this continues, I swear to God,
your sister-in-law's life will become hell. What can we do? Apart from praying
we have no other solution. May God just guide my brother. Guidance has to be sought. It doesn't come on its own. And if a person doesn't even expect it, how can they ever receive it? Khizar, we will discuss this issue later, I have to talk to you about
something important related to us. Go ahead. Papa wants to meet you. Papa wants to meet? I came to the restaurant
to meet your sister-in-law, and your brother humiliated me so much. Didn't that satisfy you? Now, if I come to meet your father, and your brother will create another scene. After all, he is ignorant. My Papa’s temperament is totally
different from that of my brother’s. Look, you know I cannot
marry you for a few years, so what will I do meeting your father? He will say the same thing that
I should bring your family. When I can take your name
in front of my family, then can you not take
my name in front of your family? Do you not love me? Sumbul, I love you. I love you a lot. But, think man, my elder sisters are sitting at home. I will look so shameless getting married. We will have to talk, Khizar. At least, meet Papa. By meeting him, at least, he will know that her daughter’s
choice is not wrong. And you discuss the issues
of your family with Papa once. It is possible that Papa
will give you a solution. Okay, if you are insisting so much then
I will come meet your father. Fine. Then, I will tell sister-in-law,
and she will talk to Papa. Since I cannot talk directly to Papa. Greetings, Amma Saeein. Greetings. How is my daughter-in-law? Thank God. Absolutely fine. Were you sleeping? No. No. Not at all. I wake up for the morning prayers, then I don’t feel sleepy at all. I really liked hearing that my daughter-in-law regularly prays. I was thinking I shouldn’t call and
bother you early in the morning. Not at all. In fact, I am really happy. I was thinking about giving
you a call for a long time, but I felt that you might not like it. Why? Hey, you are Nosherwan’s wife, our daughter-in-law. You can call me whenever you want. Yes, I will do it from now on. I wanted to ask you something. Is Nosherwan still going to Farah’s home? I understood from your silence that my talking to Nosherwan has
had no significant impact. What can I say, Amma Saeein? I feel that maybe Farah can never leave his heart. Anyway, don’t worry. I feel that this time I will have
to make harsh decisions. So, don’t worry, I am with you. Thank you. Take care of yourself. Goodbye. Goodbye. Sukha. Yes, Amma Saeein? Bring tea for me,
and add ginger to it. Sure, Amma Saeein. Did you complain
to Amma Saeein about me? You complain to the ones
who are unaware. Amma Saeein is aware of everything. Whatever happened yesterday, whether someone was right or wrong, discussing the matter is of no use. However, whatever happened
should not have happened. Such matters should be discussed
with respect within the four walls of the home. They should never reach
a restaurant or hotel, otherwise, problems arise, and what happened, happens. Uncle, you are absolutely right, and I will not lie to you. I was refusing to meet you people. But Sumbul was really anxious
with regards to her proposal and she was also insisting
that I come to meet you. Uncle, my life has some issues, that is why I was refusing
to meet you people. Look, if you have issues in your life, then you shouldn’t have committed to Sumbul. Now, neither are you sending your family
to our home to ask for the proposal, and nor do you agree that
we marry Sumbul somewhere else. There must be a solution
to this issue, right? If there was a solution
I would not have stepped back, Uncle. So, are you stepping back, now? Fine, then we will marry
Sumbul somewhere else. I will step back, Uncle. But after that, neither I, nor I hope,
Sumbul will be able to stay happy. Speak for yourself. We are here for Sumbul. Look, if it is a matter of
the happiness of you both, then the better solution is that you send your family over to our home, and have this matter sorted. Fine, we will marry you two right now. We will have the reception when you
fulfill the responsibility of your sisters. But in this whole matter,
I can give you a year. No more than that. But, Mr. Naseer, you are being… Look, I am giving you time with an open heart. Think and decide,
and let us know of your decision. I accept. Alright then. Find a suitable time and
bring your family here. Let's settle all the matters. As for the issue of your sisters' marriage, look, I will help as much as I can. After all, your sisters must be
like Sumbul as well, right? Thank you, Uncle. Thank you very much. I will inform you really soon. Uncle, please give me permission to leave. I should get going. Sit for a minute. Fiza, child. Yes. Yes. Fiza, bring tea for Khizar. Sure, I will just bring it. Sister-in-law. Thank you so much. Why are you thanking me? You are my sister. You have done more than
my own would have done. Khizar and I will always
be grateful to you. If you talk to me like a stranger,
then I will get upset. If my friend gets upset, then I will be in trouble. Congratulations to you. Hmm. The good thing is that Papa handled the situation and Khizar also understood it. All this has been made possible
because of you. I am just sad about
the way Brother treated you. Leave this useless discussion
on this happy occasion. You just think that
Khizar’s family will come and you will get married. You go quickly, I will bring it. Okay. Madam, did you call me? Yes, I am going for dinner with Ghaznavi, don’t prepare food for me. Prepare and eat whatever you
feel like eating. Sure. Till when will you come back? Today, I am in a really good mood, or else I would have surely scolded you for
asking me such a useless question. I am telling you,
I am going with Ghaznavi, I don’t know
when I will come back. That is why I am saying
you have your food and go to sleep. Lock the door, I have the keys. Sure. What did you do? Why did you say yes to the marriage? So, what else could I do? You could have done anything, but you shouldn’t have taken
the discussion forward to the wedding. Mama is right. Neither have we met his family nor do we know them, and you took the discussion forward. Look, our objective was to meet Khizar. After meeting him, I felt that he was a reasonable boy. As far as his family is concerned, look, it's our Sumbul
who has to live her life, and since Sumbul has already decided that she wants to spend her
entire life with Khizar, then who are you and I to object? Sumbul is a child. She has no idea about
the ups and downs of life. Sumbul is not that much of a child now. She has surely seen something in Khizar and chosen him. After all, he is a good boy, he is good-looking, and he is a government employee. Now even Fiza came here and she is adjusting to
a different environment. Sumbul too will have to go and adjust to a different environment. And Brother Hassam? Fahad? Fahad’s proposal is better. Look, Mr. Naseer, there is a big difference between
American dollars and a Pakistani salary. Look, our Sumbul’s heart is attached here. What will she do after going to America? Now end this argument here. I have made my decision. Sumbul will get married to Khizar. And as far as Fahad and
Brother Hassam are concerned, then I have already said no to Hassam. What? What did you say? Huh? You said no? Did you see it? Did you see what Mr. Naseer is saying? I had seen a lot yesterday. What is left to be seen? Hey. Oh God, we lost such a good proposal. What's happened to people's intelligence? It seems like their thinking
has been clouded. Where are you going? Sir has asked us to prepare the cars. For where? I don’t know. You don’t know
or you don’t want to tell me? Anyway, you live up to your loyalty, everyone knows everything. Why don’t you stop him? From what? When you are aware of where he goes, you should stop him. Even I don’t like him going there. Do you think he will stop
if I tell him to? You invited me for dinner, I was going to die of happiness. What is so special about it? It is special. After all, you have invited me. Thank you. Seriously. You have ordered all the dishes I like. I am so happy. You remember my liking even today. How can I forget? Please. What is this for? I had asked for it. It is just the two of us here, right? Yes, my two special guests are coming. I want you to meet them. I hope you are not inviting your
Amma and Baba Saeein to meet me. They are about to come.
You meet them yourselves. By the way,
you should have asked me. I had thought that you had especially
arranged this dinner for me. There is something like that. Hmm. Mama. What is the matter? Why did you get so scared? Farah, this is true that I had loved you
with my heart in the past. I really wanted to make you mine. But when you left me and went, then you were just left
in my life like a memory. And even that memory ended
after Dua came into my life. I found you again, I tried a lot to make you understand that no one can take
Dua’s place in my life now. There is no room for anyone. You didn’t understand. You had told me that
your husband has divorced you. But you didn’t tell me that
you also have a lovely son. Maybe I would have forgiven you if you had lied to me as a wife? But you have lied as a mother. What did you think? I will be so unaware of you that I will believe everything you say to me. I was trying to find your
lie since many days, and it was not difficult for me. I took out Usama’s number
from your call records. Then I had no difficulty in meeting him. This poor man has been begging
and pleading with you for a long time, and you are constantly lying to me? I have finished everything from my side that is why I didn’t find it important to tell you. Hmmm. If you were doing all this for me, then you were doing wrong. I have nothing for you in my heart. I was only tolerating your
madness out of humanity, and as soon as I got a clue about Usama, I brought him in front of you. I was going to tell you everything. Yes, we are not divorced yet but I have spoken to
the lawyer for separation. Hmmm, I don’t give anyone free advice. But, since we had a very beautiful
relationship in the past, I’ll give it to you. Return to your husband and son. There’s nothing left for you in my heart. Ghaznavi. Jaffar. Ghaznavi. You couldn’t make your own home, and you cannot see anyone
else’s home being made. So right. I will not let your home be made. I will rest when
I take you out of Ghaznavi’s life. You’ve tried so hard already. If there’s still any desire left,
then try again. Get out. Get out from here. I really like seeing this jealousy of yours. Ghaznavi has already
admitted in front of me that he does not love you. No one understands this better than me. If you have understood it, then accept it as well. Sir, you knew Madam Farah was lying to you? Yes. I always stay with you like a shadow, still you hid everything from me and you said that you are investigating. Had I told you, then how would you have
complained to your madam about me? No sir, I don’t like you being with
someone else other than madam. Your madam is a bit suspicious. If she asks questions, please testify. Yes sure. You know, I have never clarified
my integrity in front of anyone until today. But with you, it’s different. I can’t bear your displeasure, so I must provide evidence. Take a look once. If you still believe I’m guilty, then I accept whatever punishment you decide.
