Sarfaraz? Come out, Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz? What happened, my child? Why are you shouting? You call your son, ask him to come in front of me. The one whom you call your son, he has ruined
the lives of both my daughters. It was your son who pushed my daughter Dua
in a marsh of defamation in the name of love, It was your son! Your son. Your son kept on raising fingers
at my character, right? He hasn’t just ruined my sister's
life but God knows how many more girls. Sarfaraz is a predator, calling him a human being
would be an insult to humanity. What are you saying, my child? I cannot tell the humiliation
I am feeling right now. Hey, why are you crying? He will cry now. You can question me if
I am unable to make his life miserable. How dare you guys? You evil man, who plays with the weakness
of others to hide the filth inside him, I will handle you now. I will unmask this filthy face
of yours in front of everyone. Stop talking rubbish. Didn’t you feel any regrets, any sorrows at all? You wanted to be next to God for me, yeah? Are you even worthy? Hey, I considered you my first and last and
accepted you as my husband, and you, with my sister? Hey, girl, what rubbish are you speaking? Hey, I am the unfortunate, who is about
to be a mother of his child. You, you didn’t even think about our
relationship for once, right? You didn’t care even for once, right? This girl is accusing our
son of something so huge and instead of breaking her
face you are listening to her rubbish? I am not talking rubbish and it’s mothers like you who raise a finger on
the daughters of other people and cover the wrongdoings
of their own sons. Why are you standing quietly now? Hun? Tell them about your doings, tell them all that you have done. Answer my questions! You cannot give any clarification, right? Say it, say it! Shut up! Dad, she is lying, she is a liar and her sister is a liar! You have no idea she has such a filthy character, she is characterless and she just didn’t betray me but she has been
doing this with other boys too. I will put all the bullets in your chest
if you say another word against Dua. Hey, what is this hooliganism? Move him away, move him away. Listen, you call the police, call the police. What is going on? Quiet! I have all the proofs
of your son’s doings. I can call the police and have him
thrown behind bars for life if I want to. If you ever, ever look at Dua or anyone
from her family with bad intentions, you guys will have to find his body. We gave our daughter to you because we thought
you were decent, what did we know? What did we know that you don’t even know
the meaning of decency? Hey, your son is pure evil, he is evil! Ulcer! What did I want to make you
and what have you become? Get out of my house! You are a bag of humiliation! No, Naseer, no, at least you don’t talk
like a stranger to my son. Hey, whom you are calling your son, he is a predator. He is not worthy of being called a human. He, he jeopardized my life, my honor! Naseer? Dad? Dad? Dad? What happened to you? Dad, open your eyes? Please open your eyes, Dad. -What happened to you?
-Please open your eyes, Dad. Go, quickly get water. Sarfaraz? Sarfaraz, call the ambulance.
Hurry up. Naseer, for God’s sake,
open your eyes, Naseer? Quickly get water. Fiza? Fiza, cry. Cry as much as you want. Shout and yell. Hit me, say bad things to me if you want to. Don’t do this to yourself, please. No, Dua. And why are you crying? Yeah? And why would I cry? Sarfaraz will cry now. You weren’t a sinner and
I kept on blaming you. He is a sinner, I won’t spare him now. Fiza. You will never cry now. Forgive me. I am sorry. Where did they take your father? They could have at least
let me go with him. What has happened? Oh God! Believe me. my… Shut up! Just shut up. What are you doing? All this? Sarfaraz? Don’t do this, don’t, please. I am tolerating you just
because of my father, otherwise, I would have
said the three words and set you free a long time ago. What is my fault in this? Shut up! We got all the tests done but the reports haven’t come yet. Okay, fine, you wait here,
I will bring the reports. Okay. So did his reality come
out in front of everyone? This was the actual
reality of your brother and you kept on fighting with me
and Sister-in-law Fiza for your brother. It is not necessary that whatever Sister-in-law and
her sister said regarding my brother is true. Okay then, I will clear that misunderstanding
very soon too. And nothing can be hidden
from us policemen for very long, I will bring all the proofs of
your brother in front of you and then I will see how you back off. These criminals are not outsiders, they are being raised in our homes only and I see the evidence
right before my eyes. I am surprised at you, despite knowing your brother’s doings, I don’t see any resentment in your eyes. What is your problem with my brother? Your brother has
a problem with everyone, he has a habit of
spoiling everyone’s life. Are you here for my dad
or to say things to me? I am already very worried for my dad. I am surprised, someone who has a son
like Sarfaraz lived a healthy life for so long. Khizer. Shall I honestly tell you something? I feel like hanging this person to
death with my own hands when I see the helplessness of
Sister-in-law Fiza and her sister. So then, what’s the delay? Hurry up, so that you are at peace and your Sister-in-law and
her sister are at peace too. Hang him all you want. I could have never thought that my mistake would come in
the shape of Sarfaraz in front of me like this. Enough now, I am with you, forget everything. I am unable to face Fiza, I feel all this has happened
to her because of me. I am her culprit, I am the sinner. I took away her happiness, Ghaznavi. Which happiness? Can a person like Sarfaraz
give happiness to anyone? I am sure that Fiza must
be very annoyed with him too, that is why Fiza reacted
like this in front of us. Don’t blame yourself,
you didn’t do anything. Why didn’t you ask me once
you knew the whole truth? I was waiting for you to
tell me the truth yourself. I wanted to tell, I wanted to tell but
what would have I told? That Sarfaraz who is my brother-in-law, he, he, he is … Forget everything. Nothing has happened. How can I forget? I want to forget but he is in front of me, I, I want… What do you want? I want him to squirm and die. And Fiza? Imagine what will happen to her then? I was thinking about her for so long. I was thinking of her and, that is why,
I was quiet for so long. I was killing myself within me, I was squirming. I used to feel like
my heart would explode but I was just quiet so her home
wouldn’t be destroyed, now Fiza knows everything, Ghaznavi, I don’t understand
what should I do. Relax. You please don’t take tension. I am with you. I don’t understand anything. I have brought food. Fehmida, I don’t feel like eating,
take it back. Over here, you aren’t eating and the girls are also
not eating over there. It feels like God forbid,
someone has died in this house. There has been a death, the death of my daughters’ happiness, and I couldn’t even do anything. But there is just one murderer. I couldn’t even imagine that Sarfaraz would prove to be
such a disgraceful man. No, it’s my fault, I didn’t investigate. I considered my daughter to be a burden and got her married to him. What should I complain to Dua now? This Sarfaraz betrayed her. We got Fiza married
looking at their decency. How can people have
decency with evil in their hearts? People just wander with
the cover of decency on them. What will happen now, Mr. Aslam? Fiza is shattered after all this. Nothing will happen, everything will be fine. She is our daughter, we will take care of her. We will gather her existence, what else? We will explain to her that the whole world is not like Sarfaraz, a fraud. What are you thinking for Fiza? What will she do? Fehmida, we won’t do anything for now. Give her time. Give her time. She will decide after thinking thoroughly. And now we will stand by
whatever our daughters decide. Do you know, I wanted to go
and talk harshly to Mr. Naseer but the poor man is lying in
the hospital because of a heart attack. Such a disgraceful child
is a test for parents. Yeah. He is a very decent man, he couldn’t take this
humiliation from his son. Anyway, Fehmida, take this away and
try feeding it to Fiza. I will feed her too and
you also have it a little bit. I don’t feel like it. Come on, a little bit. Take it away. I don’t feel like having it. Amma Saeein, look,
the fever is not coming down. Even I am so worried, we also tried changing the doctor, it is the third day today and this fever isn’t
leaving our doll alone. I have started to get worried now. Don’t worry, God will make everything fine. Pirah? Yes? I asked you to bring things
for evil eye protection. I have brought it, madam. Take this and burn it. Okay. I am getting so anxious. How my daughter used to be chirpy
around the house like a myna. Now, when I see her lying like this,
it feels really strange, Amma Saeein. How will things work
if you lose courage like this? Mothers have to be very strong. She will get well. I will talk to your Baba Saeein
to take her to Karachi. We will take her to another
doctor over there. Okay. Amma Saeein, my children
are the support of my life. I will die if something
happens to them. God forbid, don’t be a fool. Nothing will happen to our doll, she will get well. Fiza, Fiza, my child, come and have food. I am not hungry, Mom. For how long will you starve, my love? I don’t know. Maybe forever. I have dropped down
so low in Sarfaraz’s betrayal that I am just looking for
an answer to one question. Why did all this happen to me? Why did my husband
turn out to be so bad? What is your fault in all this? Don’t blame yourself. I am not blaming myself, I am just looking for an
answer to this question, why was I chosen for all this? Fiza he is not worth thinking
so much about. God is great, He will definitely do justice to us. We are quiet because of
our honor and people, but He won’t be. Mom, why are you making her
more worried by saying all this? Okay now come, won’t you eat with us? Look, if you won’t eat
then no one will eat. And I won’t let my sister
stay hungry like this, I will feed her with my own hands. Come on, good girl. Come on. Have it, my child, you must not starve in this condition. Please. Everything will be fine. Stop there. Stop! Ask him to get away from my sight. He shouldn’t come in front of me. He must get lost! Get lost! What are you saying? He is our son. Where else would he go? Hey, I have made myself believe
that my son has died. This cruel person cannot be my son. He oppressed that girl so much. Okay, okay, fine, I won’t let him enter the room. He is not well, you must go. We have changed so many doctors but our daughter didn't get well. The doctor has prescribed some tests, if they aren’t available here, we will have to go to Karachi. So, then we must not delay
if that’s the case. I will immediately make arrangements
for you guys to go to Karachi. Won’t you come along, Saeein? No, I have some important work here. And then my health is not even
allowing me to go. You must go with Kashmala and then Nosherwan is also there,
you won’t miss me. Baba Saeein, you aren’t well,
you just recovered. We will be worried for you
if we go like this. Let’s get Mizna checked
at some local hospital here. I won’t tolerate any
negligence regarding our doll. Okay. But I cannot leave you like this. Why are you being childish? Nothing is more important than 
our daughter's health right now. Nothing will happen to our daughter,
 she will get well. And Kashmala will
take the kids to Karachi.
