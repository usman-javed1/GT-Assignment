[20.40] Sarfaraz?
[21.88] Come out, Sarfaraz.
[27.80] Sarfaraz?
[30.08] What happened, my child?
[32.16] Why are you shouting?
[38.48] You call your son,
[40.40] ask him to come in front of me.
[48.08] The one whom you call your son,
[52.88] he has ruined
the lives of both my daughters.
[68.04] It was your son who pushed my daughter Dua
in a marsh of defamation in the name of love,
[79.88] It was your son! Your son.
[86.84] Your son kept on raising fingers
at my character, right?
[90.16] He hasn’t just ruined my sister's
life but God knows how many more girls.
[97.40] Sarfaraz is a predator,
[98.96] calling him a human being
would be an insult to humanity.
[106.56] What are you saying, my child?
[108.28] I cannot tell the humiliation
I am feeling right now.
[117.36] Hey, why are you crying?
[120.08] He will cry now.
[128.00] You can question me if
I am unable to make his life miserable.
[130.48] How dare you guys?
[148.56] You evil man, who plays with the weakness
of others to hide the filth inside him,
[154.00] I will handle you now.
[159.56] I will unmask this filthy face
of yours in front of everyone.
[167.36] Stop talking rubbish.
[169.16] Didn’t you feel any regrets,
[172.00] any sorrows at all?
[179.40] You wanted to be next to God for me,
[181.80] yeah?
[182.68] Are you even worthy?
[196.80] Hey,
[198.52] I considered you my first and last and
accepted you as my husband, and you,
[203.04] with my sister?
[212.20] Hey, girl,
[213.76] what rubbish are you speaking?
[216.44] Hey,
[217.64] I am the unfortunate, who is about
to be a mother of his child.
[230.36] You,
[233.04] you didn’t even think about our
relationship for once, right?
[236.64] You didn’t care even for once, right?
[250.68] This girl is accusing our
son of something so huge
[261.00] and instead of breaking her
face you are listening to her rubbish?
[266.92] I am not talking rubbish
[268.64] and it’s mothers like you
[270.68] who raise a finger on
the daughters of other people
[272.72] and cover the wrongdoings
of their own sons.
[286.48] Why are you standing quietly now?
[287.72] Hun?
[288.76] Tell them about your doings,
[290.48] tell them all that you have done.
[298.76] Answer my questions!
[300.52] You cannot give any clarification, right?
[301.60] Say it, say it!
[302.72] Shut up!
[303.80] Dad, she is lying,
[305.84] she is a liar and her sister is a liar!
[326.24] You have no idea
[327.92] she has such a filthy character,
[329.16] she is characterless
[345.40] and she just didn’t betray me
[347.32] but she has been
doing this with other boys too.
[366.88] I will put all the bullets in your chest
if you say another word against Dua.
[390.56] Hey, what is this hooliganism?
[393.12] Move him away, move him away.
[394.76] Listen,
[395.36] you call the police,
[396.92] call the police.
[400.68] What is going on?
[401.72] Quiet!
[411.32] I have all the proofs
of your son’s doings.
[423.88] I can call the police and have him
thrown behind bars for life if I want to.
[434.72] If you ever,
[437.64] ever look at Dua or anyone
from her family with bad intentions,
[445.40] you guys will have to find his body.
[481.96] We gave our daughter to you
[486.32] because we thought
you were decent,
[501.08] what did we know?
[502.92] What did we know
[505.36] that you don’t even know
the meaning of decency?
[517.08] Hey, your son is pure evil,
[523.48] he is evil!
[560.88] Ulcer!
[563.60] What did I want to make you
and what have you become?
[572.80] Get out of my house!
[575.92] You are a bag of humiliation!
[580.40] No, Naseer, no,
[582.00] at least you don’t talk
like a stranger to my son.
[587.12] Hey, whom you are calling your son,
[590.52] he is a predator.
[596.36] He is not worthy of being called a human.
[601.32] He, he jeopardized my life, my honor!
[607.44] Naseer?
[608.12] Dad?
[608.56] Dad?
[609.80] Dad?
[610.12] What happened to you?
[610.88] Dad, open your eyes?
[611.76] Please open your eyes, Dad.
[613.44] -What happened to you?
-Please open your eyes, Dad.
[615.16] Go, quickly get water.
[617.12] Sarfaraz?
[618.20] Sarfaraz, call the ambulance.
Hurry up.
[620.84] Naseer,
[621.92] for God’s sake,
open your eyes, Naseer?
[624.52] Quickly get water.
[630.28] Fiza?
[633.20] Fiza, cry.
[636.52] Cry as much as you want.
[639.88] Shout and yell.
[646.32] Hit me,
[650.64] say bad things to me if you want to.
[653.24] Don’t do this to yourself, please.
[655.64] No, Dua.
[657.28] And why are you crying?
[663.80] Yeah?
[664.88] And why would I cry?
[667.44] Sarfaraz will cry now.
[669.48] You weren’t a sinner and
I kept on blaming you.
[675.60] He is a sinner,
[678.56] I won’t spare him now.
[684.16] Fiza.
[685.04] You will never cry now.
[687.20] Forgive me.
[694.32] I am sorry.
[741.52] Where did they take your father?
[743.32] They could have at least
let me go with him.
[745.76] What has happened?
[747.88] Oh God!
[804.52] Believe me. my…
[807.08] Shut up!
[808.84] Just shut up.
[810.60] What are you doing? All this?
[812.36] Sarfaraz? Don’t do this, don’t, please.
[819.88] I am tolerating you just
because of my father,
[823.52] otherwise, I would have
said the three words
[825.48] and set you free a long time ago.
[827.96] What is my fault in this?
[830.88] Shut up!
[852.60] We got all the tests done
[853.76] but the reports haven’t come yet.
[856.00] Okay, fine, you wait here,
I will bring the reports.
[858.76] Okay.
[866.76] So did his reality come
out in front of everyone?
[871.48] This was the actual
reality of your brother
[880.92] and you kept on fighting with me
and Sister-in-law Fiza for your brother.
[884.28] It is not necessary
[885.92] that whatever Sister-in-law and
her sister said regarding my brother is true.
[890.80] Okay then,
[892.60] I will clear that misunderstanding
very soon too.
[898.44] And nothing can be hidden
from us policemen for very long,
[908.56] I will bring all the proofs of
your brother in front of you
[910.64] and then I will see
[912.64] how you back off.
[920.00] These criminals are not outsiders,
[926.00] they are being raised in our homes only
[930.36] and I see the evidence
right before my eyes.
[939.64] I am surprised at you,
[946.32] despite knowing your brother’s doings,
[950.08] I don’t see any resentment in your eyes.
[954.24] What is your problem with my brother?
[956.48] Your brother has
a problem with everyone,
[960.08] he has a habit of
spoiling everyone’s life.
[968.76] Are you here for my dad
or to say things to me?
[972.16] I am already very worried for my dad.
[974.40] I am surprised, someone who has a son
like Sarfaraz lived a healthy life for so long.
[983.96] Khizer.
[986.00] Shall I honestly tell you something?
[991.68] I feel like hanging this person to
death with my own hands when
[998.28] I see the helplessness of
Sister-in-law Fiza and her sister.
[1001.04] So then, what’s the delay?
[1002.80] Hurry up,
[1004.16] so that you are at peace
[1005.88] and your Sister-in-law and
her sister are at peace too.
[1010.08] Hang him all you want.
[1077.84] I could have never thought
[1081.72] that my mistake would come in
the shape of Sarfaraz in front of me like this.
[1085.28] Enough now,
[1087.60] I am with you,
[1089.24] forget everything.
[1091.96] I am unable to face Fiza,
[1095.88] I feel all this has happened
to her because of me.
[1103.32] I am her culprit, I am the sinner.
[1110.12] I took away her happiness, Ghaznavi.
[1111.96] Which happiness?
[1117.60] Can a person like Sarfaraz
give happiness to anyone?
[1125.80] I am sure that Fiza must
be very annoyed with him too,
[1129.56] that is why Fiza reacted
like this in front of us.
[1138.24] Don’t blame yourself,
you didn’t do anything.
[1143.20] Why didn’t you ask me once
you knew the whole truth?
[1147.96] I was waiting for you to
tell me the truth yourself.
[1157.00] I wanted to tell,
[1161.00] I wanted to tell but
what would have I told?
[1167.04] That Sarfaraz
[1169.92] who is my brother-in-law,
[1173.64] he,
[1176.28] he, he is …
[1178.32] Forget everything.
[1180.04] Nothing has happened.
[1180.92] How can I forget?
[1185.44] I want to forget but
[1188.12] he is in front of me, I, I want…
[1192.04] What do you want?
[1194.60] I want him to squirm and die.
[1200.04] And Fiza?
[1208.64] Imagine what will happen to her then?
[1211.56] I was thinking about her for so long.
[1216.40] I was thinking of her and, that is why,
I was quiet for so long.
[1221.88] I was killing myself within me,
[1226.08] I was squirming.
[1228.48] I used to feel like
my heart would explode
[1235.76] but I was just quiet so her home
wouldn’t be destroyed,
[1238.52] now Fiza knows everything,
[1240.68] Ghaznavi, I don’t understand
what should I do.
[1243.60] Relax.
[1246.88] You please don’t take tension.
[1250.24] I am with you.
[1251.56] I don’t understand anything.
[1278.52] I have brought food.
[1284.84] Fehmida, I don’t feel like eating,
take it back.
[1292.52] Over here, you aren’t eating
[1295.96] and the girls are also
not eating over there.
[1299.20] It feels like God forbid,
someone has died in this house.
[1303.52] There has been a death,
[1307.12] the death of my daughters’ happiness,
[1315.16] and I couldn’t even do anything.
[1318.88] But there is just one murderer.
[1323.76] I couldn’t even imagine that Sarfaraz
[1327.08] would prove to be
such a disgraceful man.
[1329.60] No, it’s my fault,
[1332.68] I didn’t investigate.
[1338.44] I considered my daughter to be a burden
[1340.16] and got her married to him.
[1346.92] What should I complain to Dua now?
[1351.20] This Sarfaraz betrayed her.
[1355.44] We got Fiza married
looking at their decency.
[1361.96] How can people have
decency with evil in their hearts?
[1369.24] People just wander with
the cover of decency on them.
[1374.28] What will happen now, Mr. Aslam?
[1379.44] Fiza is shattered after all this.
[1383.24] Nothing will happen,
[1384.68] everything will be fine.
[1385.80] She is our daughter,
[1387.72] we will take care of her.
[1392.76] We will gather her existence,
[1394.52] what else?
[1399.64] We will explain to her that
[1400.52] the whole world is not like Sarfaraz,
[1402.60] a fraud.
[1405.16] What are you thinking for Fiza?
[1407.80] What will she do?
[1410.36] Fehmida, we won’t do anything for now.
[1411.44] Give her time.
[1412.44] Give her time.
[1414.92] She will decide after thinking thoroughly.
[1421.28] And now we will stand by
whatever our daughters decide.
[1430.60] Do you know, I wanted to go
and talk harshly to Mr. Naseer
[1435.36] but the poor man is lying in
the hospital because of a heart attack.
[1438.64] Such a disgraceful child
is a test for parents.
[1442.64] Yeah.
[1445.04] He is a very decent man,
[1449.88] he couldn’t take this
humiliation from his son.
[1457.60] Anyway, Fehmida,
[1459.08] take this away and
try feeding it to Fiza.
[1462.80] I will feed her too and
you also have it a little bit.
[1466.48] I don’t feel like it.
[1467.28] Come on, a little bit.
[1467.96] Take it away.
[1469.44] I don’t feel like having it.
[1489.32] Amma Saeein, look,
the fever is not coming down.
[1494.16] Even I am so worried,
[1497.24] we also tried changing the doctor,
[1499.48] it is the third day today
[1501.36] and this fever isn’t
leaving our doll alone.
[1506.36] I have started to get worried now.
[1509.72] Don’t worry,
[1510.40] God will make everything fine.
[1515.68] Pirah?
[1516.36] Yes?
[1517.20] I asked you to bring things
for evil eye protection.
[1521.08] I have brought it, madam.
[1540.32] Take this and burn it.
[1541.76] Okay.
[1545.16] I am getting so anxious.
[1549.56] How my daughter used to be chirpy
around the house like a myna.
[1555.76] Now, when I see her lying like this,
it feels really strange, Amma Saeein.
[1563.04] How will things work
if you lose courage like this?
[1567.64] Mothers have to be very strong.
[1575.24] She will get well.
[1577.04] I will talk to your Baba Saeein
to take her to Karachi.
[1587.12] We will take her to another
doctor over there.
[1593.24] Okay.
[1600.24] Amma Saeein, my children
are the support of my life.
[1604.64] I will die if something
happens to them.
[1608.88] God forbid,
[1611.32] don’t be a fool.
[1617.00] Nothing will happen to our doll,
[1619.96] she will get well.
[1640.12] Fiza,
[1642.00] Fiza, my child, come and have food.
[1646.04] I am not hungry, Mom.
[1648.12] For how long will you starve, my love?
[1653.04] I don’t know.
[1662.84] Maybe forever.
[1675.16] I have dropped down
so low in Sarfaraz’s betrayal
[1682.44] that I am just looking for
an answer to one question.
[1684.92] Why did all this happen to me?
[1697.20] Why did my husband
turn out to be so bad?
[1706.56] What is your fault in all this?
[1709.24] Don’t blame yourself.
[1712.44] I am not blaming myself,
[1714.96] I am just looking for an
answer to this question,
[1716.92] why was I chosen for all this?
[1728.76] Fiza he is not worth thinking
so much about.
[1739.24] God is great,
[1742.44] He will definitely do justice to us.
[1757.24] We are quiet because of
our honor and people,
[1761.60] but He won’t be.
[1774.56] Mom, why are you making her
more worried by saying all this?
[1788.72] Okay now come,
[1790.00] won’t you eat with us?
[1797.04] Look, if you won’t eat
then no one will eat.
[1800.16] And I won’t let my sister
stay hungry like this,
[1803.08] I will feed her with my own hands.
[1804.92] Come on, good girl.
[1808.68] Come on.
[1810.20] Have it, my child,
[1816.48] you must not starve in this condition.
[1818.96] Please.
[1851.56] Everything will be fine.
[1865.60] Stop there.
[1867.52] Stop!
[1868.96] Ask him to get away from my sight.
[1877.04] He shouldn’t come in front of me.
[1881.52] He must get lost!
[1883.20] Get lost!
[1887.36] What are you saying?
[1888.76] He is our son.
[1889.80] Where else would he go?
[1891.08] Hey, I have made myself believe
that my son has died.
[1902.80] This cruel person cannot be my son.
[1910.36] He oppressed that girl so much.
[1914.64] Okay, okay, fine,
[1916.08] I won’t let him enter the room.
[1930.28] He is not well, you must go.
[1954.88] We have changed so many doctors
[1957.72] but our daughter didn't get well.
[1964.96] The doctor has prescribed some tests,
[1968.32] if they aren’t available here,
[1969.96] we will have to go to Karachi.
[1975.96] So, then we must not delay
if that’s the case.
[1982.08] I will immediately make arrangements
for you guys to go to Karachi.
[1998.48] Won’t you come along, Saeein?
[2004.00] No,
[2006.36] I have some important work here.
[2012.64] And then
[2014.60] my health is not even
allowing me to go.
[2020.76] You must go with Kashmala
[2027.76] and then Nosherwan is also there,
you won’t miss me.
[2036.44] Baba Saeein, you aren’t well,
you just recovered.
[2039.88] We will be worried for you
if we go like this.
[2044.24] Let’s get Mizna checked
at some local hospital here.
[2048.00] I won’t tolerate any
negligence regarding our doll.
[2053.76] Okay.
[2055.88] But I cannot leave you like this.
[2061.16] Why are you being childish?
[2064.96] Nothing is more important than 
our daughter's health right now.
[2069.28] Nothing will happen to our daughter,
 she will get well.
[2072.36] And Kashmala will
take the kids to Karachi.
