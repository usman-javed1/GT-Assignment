[22.03] Sir, I did keep a high security, but…
[24.80] I told you nothing should 
happen to her, Jaffar,
[27.90] then how?
[29.13] Sir,
[31.80] I forgot everything 
because of the attack on you.
[36.97] All this happened in a night, sir.
[40.73] Jaffar,
[44.80] I can even kill you for your mistake,
[48.43] you do know that, right?
[51.43] I can sacrifice my hundred lives 
for you, Sir.
[56.93] I have made a mistake, Sir,
[61.57] and a huge mistake, Sir.
[64.97] Jaffar, go away from here,
[68.67] go away.
[95.97] Hmm,
[98.17] are you relaxed now?
[101.27] Yes,
[103.67] you all took very good care of me,
[106.60] thank you.
[108.20] Why are you talking like strangers?
[111.17] You have come very close
 to us in a few hours.
[116.73] Anyway, tell me, 
where do you want to go?
[119.27] The driver will drop you off.
[125.47] I don’t have a home.
[129.47] You don’t have a home?
[133.00] I mean if you don’t have any family,
[135.17] there must be some relatives 
that you used to live with.
[141.37] I don’t even have a relative.
[148.93] So then where will you go?
[153.03] You are beautiful and young,
[155.87] how will you stay safe on the streets?
[160.10] That is what I was thinking too.
[163.00] Anyway, there is no need to worry.
[167.20] If you don’t have a home,
[169.83] my home is here, live here,
[173.37] my daughters live here as well,
[175.60] and you live here like my daughter too.
[178.17] No one will push you out of here.
[182.77] You have done so many favors for me.
[186.00] You saved my honor,
[188.23] brought me to your home, 
gave me so much respect,
[190.73] and loved me so much,
[195.17] I am very grateful to you.
[197.87] What are you saying?
[199.60] No, seriously,
[201.60] if I live here, I will keep 
on looking for some job,
[206.67] once I get a job, I will leave,
[209.50] I won’t be a burden on you.
[211.93] Girls live in a hostel too, right?
[214.63] Yes, they do,
[217.03] I really like your self-respect,
[221.20] really liked it.
[224.37] I have a few good 
businessmen in my circle,
[228.60] if you may allow,
[230.63] shall I talk to them about your job?
[232.93] Really?
[235.43] Please talk to them if this is possible.
[238.23] Okay then, consider your job done.
[245.30] Rumi,
[248.23] this is your dress, right?
[253.37] Yes, that’s the one.
[255.97] Look,
[259.20] what a beauty in such simplicity.
[266.03] My child, have it.
[268.10] Yes.
[269.10] Yeah, please have something.
[291.13] Mom,
[294.90] mom, it’s sister’s wedding reception today,
[297.37] she must be alone there,
[299.83] none of us went to ask how she is doing.
[304.37] God knows what her in-laws 
must be thinking.
[313.97] Due to Dua’s grief,
[317.00] I totally forgot about poor Fiza.
[324.40] It was the first wedding in our house,
[328.30] we got her married in such a sad state.
[332.40] Fiza was so sad.
[335.57] But we will attend the wedding 
reception, right?
[344.30] I don’t like anything without Dua now.
[350.20] Mom, what is sister’s fault in it?
[358.10] You are right,
[361.73] God knows what she must be 
hearing from her in-laws.
[371.37] Give me your clothes and Dad’s, 
I will iron them.
[376.10] No one will go anywhere.
[380.47] What are you saying, Mr. Aslam?
[382.07] I am right.
[385.43] I have been hiding my face
 from the entire world,
[388.23] I have been hiding my face
[389.63] and you are asking me to go 
in front of the world, face them.
[392.63] Fiza is our daughter by blood.
[394.73] How can we do this to her?
[397.60] Did our daughter care about us?
[400.40] They brought shame 
to us in the whole world.
[403.47] Whatever happened to Dua,
[406.17] it’s not their fault, 
don’t blame them for it.
[410.10] It's all your fault, it's all your fault,
[412.90] I kept on telling 
you don’t give birth to the girls,
[415.47] don’t birth to the girls.
[420.83] If I had a son today,
[425.07] I wouldn’t have to see this day today.
[427.77] If you and your daughter 
are so looking forward
[430.10] to attending the wedding reception,
 then you guys go,
[433.63] I am not coming along.
[441.03] One of them got married 
without the groom and family,
[445.07] and now if you want
[446.77] the second one to also get ruined and 
come back here the very next day of her wedding,
[450.40] so then fine,
[452.57] why don’t you do one thing,
[454.40] bring some poison for both of us as well,
[457.03] so you can get rid of all of us for once.
[464.47] What is this that you…
[555.70] Still, no one knows who she went with,
[562.00] we have just gotten a report
[564.67] that she was taken to the police station 
after the apartment was raided.
[569.40] I couldn’t even find out 
how she got there.
[573.67] Why do some stories have 
so much suffering in their fate?
[640.80] What happened?
[641.77] Hey, listen,
[644.60] tell me what is this way 
your son is behaving?
[646.87] Tell him to sit in one place 
with the daughter-in-law.
[650.20] He dressed up as a groom and 
is sitting here because you asked him to,
[653.00] isn’t that enough?
[654.83] I was against this event myself.
[656.77] Your daughter-in-law and her family 
do not deserve this respect.
[660.70] What?
[695.00] What?
[699.53] Greetings.
[700.60] Greetings, greetings.
[703.07] Did you guys just come? 
We were desperately waiting for you.
[707.03] It’s just…
[707.87] We had to introduce you to people. Yeah?
[714.73] You look so beautiful, sister.
[717.93] But this tension on your face 
doesn’t look nice at all.
[720.40] Stop worrying about me, 
I am worried for you guys.
[723.23] Tell me,
[724.27] any news on Dua? 
Did she come home?
[727.03] Sister did come home but 
Dad didn’t let her enter in the house
[730.20] and she was crying a lot.
[732.30] Did you ask her where she went?
[734.87] We would have only got a chance 
to ask anything had Dad opened the gate.
[737.87] Sister was continuously 
requesting on the door
[739.93] to let her come in and listen to her
[742.17] but Dad,
[743.60] he got so stone-hearted.
[746.23] Mom,
[748.00] didn’t Mom let Dua come inside?
 Didn’t she even try?
[751.93] Mom tried
[754.17] but Dad threatened Mom
[756.77] that if she opened the gate and 
if sister came in, he would divorce her.
[764.10] My lovely Mom.
[768.43] Control yourself.
[769.83] No one even asked 
how I am, Sania.
[773.63] Control yourself,
[774.87] everyone is watching you 
what will they think?
[778.37] Dua.
[780.13] Sania…
[784.93] Control yourself.
[789.93] Kausar,
[791.73] what are you doing? 
People are sitting here.
[793.43] Don’t make me realize 
that people are here,
[796.20] at least let me ask them
[799.23] what my son ever did to them.
[802.33] For what have they taken revenge on him?
[804.57] Why did they spoil my son’s wedding day?
[812.43] Sister, if you know anything about this,
[815.73] please do us a favor 
and end this topic here.
[819.07] All the people that are sitting here 
don’t know much about this.
[827.83] Why?
[829.60] Let them find out.
[830.90] They should also know
[832.63] what a fraud you guys have done with us.
[834.80] Hey, we didn’t do any fraud.
[838.07] What did we demand from you guys?
[840.17] We didn’t even take a needle 
in the name of dowry,
[844.17] and you guys took such 
advantage of our decency?
[847.77] That you got your publicly 
disgraced daughter to our home?
[850.77] Sister, no, our Fiza’s character is clean.
[854.87] She will prove to be a very good 
daughter-in-law for you, trust me.
[857.43] We don’t need such a daughter-in-law
[859.07] that will bring disgrace with her.
[861.97] The younger sister ran away,
[863.77] now let’s see what the elder one does,
[865.60] God knows what will she do 
after coming to this house.
[867.60] Hey? 
Shut up,
[869.87] let’s go from here. 
Why should I shut up?
[874.53] Let them hear what liars they are.
[877.80] They were telling us
[879.60] that the daughter was not well,
[881.40] she was at home,
[882.37] and what do we know 
she ran away from the back.
[884.37] Now we have this daughter at our home,
[885.83] their elder daughter, 
now let’s see
[887.57] if she can stay home or not, 
will she run away from our home as well?
[890.50] Be quiet! You guys please sit.
[893.70] Son, get them seated.
[895.60] You come with me.
[896.63] Why? Let me talk to them.
I am asking you to come.
[899.67] Take her. Son?
[905.50] See? Now you guys stay.
[907.30] I kept on telling you 
mother and daughter
[909.33] that I have just a little bit of honor left,
[912.77] don’t destroy it,
[917.40] but you guys don’t listen to anyone,
now tolerate it,
[920.43] you guys stay here, I am leaving.
[921.57] Mr. Aslam, stay,
[924.50] how will both of us come back at night?
[995.87] Dua,
[997.13] you are sitting here and 
I was looking for you inside.
[1001.83] I just came for open air.
[1005.07] Dua,
[1006.57] are you crying?
[1009.90] No,
[1011.23] I guess something went in my eye.
[1015.80] If there is a problem 
you can share it with me, Dua.
[1025.60] May I use your phone?
[1030.40] Umm, phone?
[1033.37] I will just make a small call, please.
[1036.30] Hey, I was just generally asking.
[1039.80] You may call.
[1041.47] Thank you.
[1050.03] Rumi,
[1052.07] if you don’t mind,
[1054.47] I want to talk alone.
[1057.63] No problem.
[1059.10] You go ahead, I will leave.
[1072.07] Are you going somewhere?
[1073.87] Yes, I am going to a party
 at Mr. Hashim’s,
[1077.07] you should come too, 
what will you do at home?
[1078.97] I am not in the mood, 
his parties are very boring.
[1081.97] By the way, you have a lot of attitude.
[1084.97] Where is Dua?
[1087.47] She has taken my phone,
[1089.07] she was saying that she needs 
to make an important call.
[1092.60] And you gave her your phone.
[1094.33] Yeah, so I couldn’t have refused.
[1096.97] By the way, Mom, 
we don’t know who she is,
[1098.30] or where she is from,
[1099.60] you shouldn’t have just 
brought her here like this.
[1102.37] We don’t know what were her 
intentions when she left home,
[1104.03] she can be dangerous to us.
[1106.07] She is saying she has no one.
[1109.63] And you think she is 
telling you the truth?
[1114.17] I have my doubts too.
[1116.07] Listen, why did you give her your phone?
[1118.10] You should have heard who she is 
talking to and what she is talking about.
[1121.20] I tried,
[1122.60] but she is very clever,
[1124.30] she said she wanted to 
talk alone so I should leave.
[1127.33] And you left?
[1129.20] You should have secretly listened.
[1130.87] Relax, Mom, I have turned on 
call recording in my phone,
[1134.33] every incoming and 
outgoing call will be recorded,
[1136.60] let her talk to anyone she wants to.
[1138.43] Hmm,
[1140.37] smart,
[1143.60] very smart.
[1144.93] Okay, bye. 
Bye.
[1155.30] Hello.
[1158.33] How are you?
[1161.57] Dua? 
Yes, the same Dua
[1165.93] who you looted in the name of 
love for your wrong intentions
[1170.13] and then put a price on her and 
threw her in this ditch.
[1175.63] You cannot even imagine,
[1177.07] you pathetic man, how much 
did I lose because of you.
[1182.37] I lost everything, my everything,
[1186.33] my parents, my sisters and everything.
[1192.37] I feel disgusted when I think 
that I trusted a person like you.
[1198.70] Look, you are having a misunderstanding,
[1200.83] I am not who you think I am.
[1202.77] People must be thinking 
you are very noble,
[1206.57] but have you ever thought
[1209.00] when I will yell and tell them 
what you have done to me,
[1213.73] what will they think about you?
[1218.77] You won’t be left with anything,
[1220.73] anything at all.
[1221.87] If I want, I can get you 
arrested by the police,
[1224.60] did you hear me?
[1255.87] After all, what happened to you?
[1259.57] That is why my heart was 
constantly worried for you.
[1263.63] That dream I had, wasn’t a lie.
[1267.30] I wish I could go back in time.
[1280.10] Sir?
[1282.43] Jaffar, before I lose my cool, leave.
[1286.27] Umm,
[1287.27] sir, I had no idea.
[1289.73] Leave!
[1292.77] Okay, sir.
[1314.63] Did you see?
[1316.50] Did you see it?
[1319.73] That is why, I was saying,
[1320.97] that is why I was saying that don’t go.
[1323.17] But you guys forcefully took me.
[1325.63] I wouldn’t have gone there my whole life.
[1327.83] Now bear the humiliation.
[1329.37] It was our daughter’s wedding reception,
[1331.57] how wouldn’t we go?
[1334.17] Mr. Aslam, I am a mother
[1335.90] and I was thinking as a mother.
[1337.77] What did you achieve by going?
[1339.37] We just got humiliated.
[1340.70] Hey, you just care about your own self.
[1343.43] Just think about Fiza,
[1346.93] did you hear the words 
sister Kausar was using?
[1349.70] You heard it right?
[1350.87] The one who said so much to us,
[1353.03] just think what she must 
have said to our daughter.
[1356.53] You have to listen to the world 
because of your doings.
[1362.40] One daughter ran away and 
brought disgrace to me,
[1365.27] the second one’s in-laws are 
humiliating us and letting us out.
[1368.67] Listen to one thing,
[1370.13] I have no relation with your daughters
[1371.87] and their in-laws from now onwards.
[1374.50] It’s over.
[1375.80] What are you saying?
[1380.23] What kind of a fate 
my daughters are born with?
[1384.67] Happiness runs away from them.
[1389.13] Dua,
[1391.30] hey, Dua, what have you done? 
What have you done?
[1396.77] Your sisters have to go through 
so much because of you.
[1400.47] If not about yourself, at least 
you should have thought about your sisters.
[1411.73] Hmm.
[1414.07] I am so sorry to hear about your story.
[1418.13] Your family shouldn’t have done this to you.
[1422.83] I admit,
[1424.40] that we lose control of ourselves 
when we are young,
[1426.30] such small mistakes do happen,
[1428.83] but they should have at least heard you.
[1434.87] I trusted a stranger
[1439.60] and committed a crime
by falling in love with him,
[1445.63] how could they forgive me and 
open the doors of their house for me?
[1449.20] What if your own family 
closed the doors on you,
[1454.33] the doors of this house will 
always be open for you.
[1458.23] Don’t worry.
[1460.43] Dua, you live here comfortably,
[1462.60] I can understand,
[1464.77] you feel light just by recalling 
the memories of your family.
[1470.23] Okay, give me the name 
and number of that boy.
[1476.03] I will teach him such a lesson
[1477.73] that he will get on his knees 
and apologize to you.
[1479.93] No, no,
[1482.27] I don’t want to look back at my past,
[1486.10] I don’t even want to think about my past.
[1492.30] He,
[1494.70] whatever he did to me,
[1498.43] it was wrong,
[1500.20] very wrong
[1503.97] but I went there myself.
[1507.93] I shouldn’t have gone.
[1511.43] Okay,
[1512.90] if you don’t want to tell me anything
about that boy, that’s not a problem,
[1516.93] but don’t ever cry again.
[1519.77] And tell me
[1522.00] what have you decided for the future?
[1524.80] I mean
[1526.37] how will you live such a long life 
without your family, all alone?
[1532.87] I don’t know.
[1535.87] But
[1537.70] going back to my family,
[1540.60] at their door,
[1543.33] I don’t want to hurt them.
[1547.00] I,
[1547.73] I won’t be a burden on you as well.
[1550.80] I will do a job.
[1552.33] That’s good
[1553.93] that you want to forget the bitter 
memories of your past and move on,
[1558.73] it will be better if you stay busy.
[1561.10] It will be great if you do a job.
[1563.53] I mean, I told you
[1564.93] I have a few people in my circle, 
good, big businessmen,
[1568.23] I have spoken to them about your job, 
just stay ready for the interview.
[1572.07] I will arrange a meeting for you soon.
[1574.70] Really? 
Yes.
[1576.47] What did you think of your mama?
[1580.23] Big and respectable people 
of this city, respect me.
[1587.03] I,
[1588.60] I will forever be grateful to you, 
this will be another favor on me from you.
[1594.67] Uff ho, what’s a favor in it?
[1597.77] just consider your job done.
[1602.53] Always stay happy.
[1614.47] The same Dua
[1615.97] who you looted in the name of love 
for your wrong intentions
[1620.10] and then put a price on her 
and threw her in this ditch.
[1626.27] You cannot even imagine,
[1628.50] you pathetic man how much 
did I lose because of you.
[1632.63] I lost everything, my everything,
[1636.20] I feel disgusted when I think 
that I trusted a person like you.
[1647.47] People must be thinking 
you are very noble,
[1650.77] but have you ever thought
[1652.83] when I will yell and tell them 
what you have done to me,
[1657.30] what will they think about you?
[1661.73] I can get you arrested by the police,
[1664.33] did you hear me?
[1694.30] Why are you getting so mad at me?
[1699.83] Look, whatever happened is not my fault.
[1705.03] Yes,
[1707.50] you are not at fault, 
it’s my fault,
[1712.27] my parents got me married 
in such a family.
[1717.40] Don’t say that.
[1722.47] Sania was saying that
[1724.93] Dad didn’t give a chance Dua 
to say anything,
[1729.67] otherwise, she may be innocent.
[1732.30] And she might have been in trouble.
[1736.57] I know my sister very well,
[1740.77] and my heart says the same,
[1742.47] yes, she had a very liberal mindset
[1746.87] but she wasn’t the kind 
who would run with some boy.
[1750.47] Okay,
[1753.20] are you done giving a speech 
about your sister?
[1755.67] Give a little attention 
to your husband as well,
[1757.63] try to get to know him as well.
[1761.00] And let me clear one thing to you,
[1763.83] I don’t like talking about 
your sister very much.
[1768.23] To be honest,
[1769.97] a girl whose character is not very good,
[1773.77] if you will defend her, your character
 will be questioned too.
[1778.53] What are you saying?
[1782.67] I am your wife.
[1784.67] That’s why I am telling you,
[1788.27] don’t talk about her in front of me.
[1792.73] One quest… 
Enough!
[1825.37] I am embarrassed, Sir,
[1827.67] I couldn’t fulfill my responsibility properly.
[1830.17] You have embarrassed 
my trust in you, Jaffar.
[1833.60] What did I ask from you?
 Just her safety.
[1836.20] You couldn’t even do that.
[1838.47] I apologize.
[1840.00] You cannot be forgiven,
[1842.83] you won’t be forgiven till Dua is found.
[1851.87] Sir, the inspector is here to meet you.
[1857.53] I am coming.
[1859.27] Okay.
[1862.10] Sir,
[1863.93] inspector?
Is everything all right?
[1870.60] You can be careless Jaffar, not me.
[1874.63] Now, until Dua is not found,
[1877.57] I won’t sit in peace!
[1899.87] greetings.
[1901.07] Greetings.
[1903.37] Greetings, sister-in-law, come sit.
[1906.77] Wait.
[1911.03] Come sit here with me.
[1917.60] Brother, shall I give you tea?
[1923.47] Greetings, uncle.
[1924.43] Greetings, my child.
[1926.57] Have something.
[1927.90] Okay.
[1934.87] The wedding reception has passed,
[1937.90] now stop being a bride and 
know about the house.
[1942.17] What?
[1943.57] Yes.
[1946.40] and the way you tail your husband 
out of the room,
[1950.80] this won’t happen from tomorrow.
[1952.17] Do you understand?
[1956.23] I,
[1957.57] I will be careful from tomorrow.
[1960.17] You will have to be careful.
[1964.60] Listen,
[1966.70] the bride has just come home, 
let her stay comfortably for a few days.
[1973.27] Really?
[1974.90] So, then you tell me,
[1977.20] after how many months should I 
give this responsibility to her?
[1980.13] I am not talking about months,
[1982.77] I am talking about a few days,
[1984.97] do you understand?
[1986.83] Let her stay comfortably for a few days.
[1990.47] And Sarfaraz, do one thing, 
have breakfast,
[1994.33] and then take daughter-in-law
 to her parent’s house.
[1999.93] Usually, girls go to their home 
after the wedding,
[2003.63] sit with their family, 
talk and lighten their hearts.
[2008.70] The burden is on our chests,
[2011.57] until when will we bear this burden?
[2013.77] Will you stay quiet for a while or not?
[2025.23] Sarfaraz?
[2026.97] Did you hear me?
[2029.50] Yes, I did.
[2031.57] I will take her.
[2033.63] My child, have breakfast
[2035.77] then get ready to go to your house,
[2038.37] Sarfaraz will pick you back in the evening.
