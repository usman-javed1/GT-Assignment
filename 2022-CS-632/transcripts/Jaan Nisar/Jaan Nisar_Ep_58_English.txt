How are you feeling now Nosherwan? Where is Dua? Ah, your health isn’t good right now, dear. You need rest. Rest now. Take it easy, take it easy. I’m fine now, Baba Saeein, where is Dua? She went to her mother’s house, where else would she go? Jaffar Yes Sir? Go bring Dua. Yes, Sir. Dua is not at her mother’s house. If she’s not at her mother’s house,
then where is she? In the lock-up. In the lock-up? Why? Because she tried to kill you. That’s why I had her arrested. You shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn’t have done that? Nosherwan, what was I supposed to do? Let you die like that? I saw with my own eyes
that she gave you poison. You regained consciousness
after two days. Look at your condition now, and you're telling me
I shouldn’t have done that? Jaffar. Sir? Go free her, go now. Jaffar will not go at any cost, I won’t let that happen at all. I won’t let you free her that easily. She… she tried to take your life,
how can she just walk out like that? Kashmala is absolutely right, dear. Let her stay in the lock-up. You could have lost your life. My life is already gone, Baba Saeein. All the formalities are complete. Please check them. You only have to sign these papers. Are you really withdrawing
the case yourselves? Yes. You people are something else, first, you have someone arrested, and then you withdraw the FIR. Sign these papers and
release our client. Mustafa, bring her. Thank you. You're welcome. Let’s go, please. Yes, Khadim Hussain,
bring the car out. I have to go somewhere. You go inside. Ghaznavi? He is alive, he has regained consciousness now. Thank God. This has happened on Sir’s orders. Only then was this possible. Just take care of yourself. Dua? come in!. Sister? My child, thank God that you have returned! Who arranged your bail? Ghaznavi did. He sent Jaffar, and he dropped me here. Thank God my daughter has returned home. Sania, go tell your father that Dua is back. I knew my daughter could never try
to take someone's life. Come, sit. Sit, dear, sit. You’re back again? How did you let her in? Keep quiet, Fizza. Why? Why should I keep quiet? A girl who gave her husband poison
and left him to die can’t be trusted at all. I can't trust her. She ruined her sister’s home, poisoned her husband, and now you’re letting her
enter this house. Do you think she’ll spare you all? She’s a heartless witch
who devours people. -What are you saying?
-No! There’s still time, Father,
throw her out now, or she’ll poison all of us and kill us. -Dear, listen to me.
-What do you all think? Ghaznavi got her
released out of love? I’m sure he did it out of pity. If he had love in his heart for her or thought she was innocent,
he would have called her to himself, not had her released by a servant. I can’t trust her. What are you saying? Your sister has only been here
for two minutes! Dua… Let her at least breathe, you’re speaking whatever is coming
to your mind. You keep talking and talking... Nosherwan Saeein, have your soup and
then take your medicine. Jaffar hasn’t returned yet? Oh, here he is… Jaffar, where is Dua? Sir, I picked her up from the police station
and dropped her off at her mother’s house. Dua didn’t come to meet me? Why would she come now? The one who tried to take your life, you pardoned her life, and now you’ve set her free. What’s her business here? No Amma Saeein, my heart isn’t ready to believe it. Dua wouldn’t do this. She already did it. That’s why we were against her. We didn’t want you to marry
such a low-class girl. Whatever you say... I won’t believe it. Dua couldn’t poison me. If Dua didn’t poison you,
then who did? Tell me. He is right, Dua didn’t try to take his life. Neither did she poison his food. If Dua didn’t give the poison, then how did his life end up in danger? Actually, Baba Saeein, that food was made for me by Dua. Specifically for me. She wanted to take my life. It... It was a mistake that I placed that food
in front of Nosherwan. If I had even the slightest idea that
the food was poisoned, I would have eaten it myself and died
rather than let anything happen to my Saeein. That way, even Dua would have had her revenge. She doesn’t like it, she doesn’t like it at all that
I am married to Saeein. That’s why she wanted to take my life. A life is a life, whether it's yours or Nosherwan’s. That low-class girl, I had always
expected this from her. No, Baba Saeein,
she couldn’t do such a thing. Why don’t you all understand? Dua can’t take anyone’s life. She is not like that. Madam. Please go from here. Jaffar, just once, just let me meet him once. I’ll take one look and leave right away. Jaffar, this is my special order. Now that girl shouldn’t even be
seen near Nosherwan. Baba Saeein’s special order is that
you are not allowed to meet Sir. Please, I beg you, just let me meet him once. From afar, I’ll only take one look and
won’t say anything to anyone. I’ll leave. Madam, why are you making me
out to be a sinner? You are my Madam,
you are Sir’s wife. You are deserving of respect from me. But Madam, I can’t let you meet Sir. Just, just one look. I will fall at your feet
if you say so. But, Oh! Madam! What are you doing? I…I… I won’t say anything to anyone.
I’ll quietly leave. For Ghaznavi’s sake. Please just one look. Okay, Madam, just one glance. Go… Why have you come here? I’ve come to see Ghaznavi. You have come to see him? You try to kill him, you poison him, and now you come to visit him? What kind of drama is this?
Hunh? If Baba Saeein and
Amma Saeein see you, it’ll be a big problem for you. You intended to cause difficulties for me. Yes, I did, but I had to back off because of
Saeein here as well. Otherwise, you would have spent
your whole life behind bars. Before I do something
worse with you, leave now. I just want to see Ghaznavi
for a little while. Haven’t you seen him already? Yes? You’ve seen him to your heart’s content. Now, go away.
Leave. What are you doing here? We spared your life
in exchange for our son. Consider that your fortune. Now go away and never come back into
my son’s life again. Baba Saeein, Baba Saeein, I didn’t do anything. I didn’t do anything, I just wanted to see Ghaznavi once, please. Go away from here. Why are you sitting here? Come on, he needs to rest.
Let’s go! We won’t bother Uncle at all, Mother. Yes Mother, we won’t disturb him at all.
Promise! Come on, don’t be stubborn. Arham, Mizna, come on, let’s go. Come on, good job. Okay, come on, kids, you may leave. You can come back later. -Okay, Uncle.
-Okay, Uncle. Let’s go. I’ll serve something for you to eat. Please, get my clothes ready. Yes. Jaffar. Yes? Get my clothes, I’d like to change. Yes, Sir. And... where are Dua’s clothes and belongings?
I didn’t see them. She has taken everything. When you were unconscious, she packed everything and left. She must have thought
you were going to die, so she gathered her things
and left before that. Now, she’ll be waiting for
news of your death so that she can finish her mourning period
and marry Sarfaraz. I’ll take your leave, Sir. No, no, don’t go. I’ll leave. I’ll go myself. You stay. Sir, I’ll bring your clothes. What are you doing here? I’ll stay here with you until
your health improves. My health is fine now. I don’t need anyone. You can go. You may need me, you’ve not fully recovered yet. I’ll stay with you tonight. I’ve already told you that
I don’t need anything. You can leave,
and I don’t like repeating myself. -Nosherwan…
-Go away. How do I convince you? I have given you so many clarifications, I have told you so many times but…. Sarfaraz was lying. He wasn’t telling the truth. He wants to poison your heart against me
so much that you’ll leave me. That’s how he’ll get his revenge. But she could’ve called me. Doesn’t she know I need her? We spared your life
in exchange for our son. Consider that your fortune. Now go away and never come back into
my son’s life again. Hello, Ghaznavi, how are you? Do you know I came to see you? But no one let me meet you. Everyone thinks I tried to
poison you and kill you. That’s not true. I swear, I didn’t put poison in the food. How could I take your life?
I love you so much. I… I… I could even give up my life for you. Ghaznavi, Ghaznavi? Ghaznavi thinks that I poisoned him. That I tried to take his life. You know me very well. I love him so much,
I can’t even think…. If Ghaznavi trusted you, you wouldn’t have been
taken by the police. And after regaining consciousness, Ghaznavi wouldn’t have been
careless about you. The truth is, Dua, Ghaznavi has recognized
your deceitful face. How many more lives will you ruin? You’ve destroyed my home, Dua. You have made my child’s identity disappear
before it even entered this world. And now you’re saying that we shouldn’t hold you responsible
for the incident that happened with Ghaznavi? Dua, you must have done something that makes no one even want
to see your face. I made a huge mistake by leaving the back door open for Sarfaraz. That’s why my sister has set up a court and held a trial treating me
like a criminal today. You made me say all these things. You’ve brought me to this point Dua. What didn’t I do for you? I used to love you a lot. And I still love you, Fizza. I didn’t know that my past mistakes
would enter my present and destroy my future like this. I had no idea… Be quiet now,
she is already very disturbed. Child, quiet now. It’s not right to be this troubled
in such a state. Keep yourself together.
