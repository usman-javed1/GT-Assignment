Nosherwan. Yes? Why has she come here
to put salt on our wounds? Who? No, I didn’t call her. So, if you didn't call her,
I didn't call her, and Kashmala certainly didn't call her, then who called her? Who told her that today is
Zawar’s death anniversary? I’ll see. Why have you come here? To meet you. To see you. I hate you. Your face doesn't support your words. You still love me. Whatever was between us is now over. I will leave you very soon. This is my final decision. Go from here. My love will force you
to change your decision. My decision will never change. I will leave you. What… What is she doing here? Who called you? Come on, get out of here. Go. Why? When murderers are
roaming around here freely, then why can’t I come here? What do you mean? I'll make you understand
the meaning as well. What nonsense are you talking about? Has your mind gone crazy? She is saying all sorts of ridiculous things. Leave from here, come on, get out of here! I am not going anywhere. Before giving me a divorce, just once... just give me one chance to explain myself. Kashmala made a deal with
Sarfaraz to remove me from your life. I have proof of this. Just like this, keep Dua trapped
in the web of your love. Nosherwan Saeein has
called the lawyer and told him to prepare the divorce papers. He is finally giving Dua a divorce. We will soon succeed
in our objective, and... you will get all your money. This, this… this isn’t my voice, Nosherwan. Do you think this is my voice? What are you trying to do? Do you think they’ll believe
your words, huh? By making them listen to
this fake edited audio, do you think you'll turn
Nosherwan against me, huh? You shouting and screaming
won't prove the lie to be the truth. If you don't believe this,
I have many more proofs. What proof do you have, huh? Nosherwan, she… Listen, you, yourself were having
an affair with Sarfaraz, -and I think this child…
-Enough! If you say one more word, I will take your life. Jaffar! Here is your enemy, Sir. Speak up! Whatever I did, I did it at Kashmala’s insistence, she didn't want them to be together. Phone. This is Sarfaraz’s phone, it has many other proofs
against Kashmala. Have a look. The conversation that
she had with Sarfaraz, he kept it saved with him. So that, later on,
he could even blackmail her and ask for an even bigger amount. Kashmala even kept a price
on Sarfaraz’s head, but, Jaffar reached there
at the right time and managed everything. These… These two are together. These two are together! Absolutely! You are trying to trap me to save yourself? Well done, Dua. Well done! Nosherwan, you know that
Sarfaraz is her pawn, right? What are you staring at?
Why are you listening to her? Just give her the divorce
and end this topic. Nosherwan won’t give divorce to Dua. Baba Saeein, what are you saying? I made a very big mistake
in recognizing a witch like you. Saeein, this is Zawar’s diary. It was lost. After so many years,
where did you find it? The murderer also tried to erase this mark. Thanks to Jaffar though. Jaffar, what is all this? After Zawar Sir’s death, Madam Kashmala gave
this diary to Pirah to burn it. Pirah, for some unknown reason, did not burn this diary out of greed
or any other motive. And yes, the poison that you were given
wasn’t given by Madam Dua, but by Madam Kashmala. Pirah has already confessed to this. This diary was also found in Pirah's room. Pirah! In this diary, my son had poured out his heart. How you had been tearing him
apart like a witch! Zawar’s suspicion regarding
you was completely correct. Before this suspicion could be revealed,
you had already led him to his death! What are you saying, Saeein? Our enemies did not carry out
the attack on Zawar, but Kashmala took advantage of that enmity and had our Zawar killed. She took our son away from us. How can that be possible? Why would Kashmala want
to kill Zawar in the first place? Because Kashmala knew that if Zawar was out of the way, she would have to come into
a marriage with Nosherwan. And in this way, this snake's
heart's desire would be fulfilled. What kind of ridiculous thing
are you saying? Just thinking about it
makes us feel disgusted. This is the truth, Madam. Before his death,
Sir Zawar had expressed to me that Kashmala's inclination is
more towards Sir Ghaznavi. He had also written all these things
in his diary as well. And yes, I personally saw Madam Kashmala
dealing with Sarfaraz. When you were unconscious, she was getting you to sign
on this stamp paper. She also had your thumb impression
affixed on the stamp paper. Here is the same stamp paper, Sir. It has your thumbprints on it,
and I took it from her purse. Where did I put the paper? It might be in the bag. It’s not even here. Where did it go? It’s not even here. You’re lying! Nosherwan, he’s lying! How can you believe him? This… this is your scheme too,
isn’t it, Dua? He’s in... Jaffar is in on this with her too! You’re with her, right? Don’t you feel any shame? You’ve brought everyone over to your side! What are you trying to do?
Narrow minded murderer?! Enough! It’s not her who’s narrow-minded, you are! You’ve sunk so low in your desires. that you took your own husband’s life,
our son’s life? I raised you with these hands, nurtured you, groomed you,
fed you in my own lap. I put each bite in your mouth one by one. This is how you repaid our love? By killing our son? Yes, I took Zawar’s life,
Amma Saeein, I did! But at least ask me once why I did it! Amma Saeein, I… I loved Nosherwan, Amma Saeein! I did all of this to get Nosherwan! All of this was to get Nosherwan. You... I couldn’t have imagined that you…
you’d fall to this level. When Nosherwan was yours, then why did you try to poison him? Because I was tired, Baba Saeein! I was exhausted! I did everything possible
to get Nosherwan, I tried everything! And when… when everything was finally right, Nosherwan wasn’t ready to leave Dua. What was I supposed to do? So I mixed poison in his food, yes! If Nosherwan can’t be mine,
then he can’t be anyone’s! Despicable! Vile! Yes! I am despicable, vile! I made a mistake! I know! I shouldn’t have poisoned Nosherwan! I should’ve poisoned her instead! Enough! Nosherwan, I...
I did all this just to have you. I swear, I only wanted you,
Nosherwan, please understand. Just order and I’ll shoot her right now! No, no, no, Nosherwan. If she weren’t a woman, I would have beheaded
my brother’s murderer with my own hands! Nosherwan, please. Amma… Amma Saeein! Amma Saeein, please, tell Nosherwan... Take her away! Nosherwan, why did you call these people? Amma Saeein!
Amma Saeein, please, why did you call these people?
Please, listen to me... Take her away! No, Baba Saeein!
Baba… Nosherwan! Nosherwan…
Nosherwan, please! Nosherwan! I want to apologize to all of you. Whatever I did, I shouldn’t have done it. Fiza, please forgive me. I shouldn’t have acted that way. Dua… Dua, please forgive me, Dua. I was always wrong about you. I doubted you, you. Please forgive me. Fiza, the principal is calling you. Okay. I was just coming
to give you this planner. -Okay, thank you.
-I’ll go meet with him. Sir, you called me? Yes, please come in. Have a seat, Miss Fiza. I’m glad you decided to
rejoin the school, Miss Fiza. It had to, sir. I was very saddened to hear
about what happened to you. It's a part of life. I don't want to remember the past. That's good. Miss Fiza, I wanted to discuss
something with you. Yes, Sir, please go ahead. You know very well that
my Missus passed away last year, and I have two young daughters who need a mother. So if you don’t mind,
could I introduce them to you? I think I may have upset you. But it’s okay if your answer is no,
there’s nothing wrong with that. Consider it as if I never talked
to you about this. You may go now, join your class. You can introduce me to your daughters. Okay. Nosherwan must have
come to pick me up. I... I’m going, Nosherwan has come to get me. I’m going. I... I’m going to meet Nosherwan.
Nosherwan! He’s here to pick me up, right? Huh? I told you, right? I told you he would definitely come for me! He has come to take me!
I’m going to go! Look, he’s here, isn’t he?
He’s come for me… I knew he would definitely come! Nosherwan has come for me! Nosherwan has come to take me!
I told you, right? I told you he would come for me! I was telling you he would come to get me. He has come for me… to take me. He…he... he has left Dua and chosen me,
he came to get me! Nosherwan! -Nosherwan!
-Where are you going? Here’s your tea. Yes. Fehmida, I think you spent your whole life
trying to understand my mood. You tried to understand everything I said, but I never gave you anything in life. I couldn’t give you anything. What did I give you? Fatigue? Anger? All that? What did you get out of life?
Nothing. What are you saying? I have no complaints against you. Time passed by in your short temperament. Now that you’ve realized it, all my complaints have ended. That’s… that’s your big-heartedness, Fehmida, that you forgave me. Otherwise, my sin isn’t that which can be forgiven. It’s not like that, don’t say such things. Look, now whatever your heart says,
just say it to me. At least it will lessen my regret, hmm? Actually, I wanted to say that we’ve said
yes to Wasif’s family for Fiza’s marriage. But I was thinking we should invite
Dua and Ghaznavi over too, and Wasif as well at home
so everyone can meet here and we can set a date for
the wedding together. Yes, yes, call them, call them.
That’s the right thing to do. These matters should be handled
with everyone’s consent. Alright. I’ll invite them for dinner tomorrow. I’ll call Dua, and you can call Ghaznavi and Wasif. Sure, I’ll handle it.
Don’t worry, invite them. Dua’s one small mistake caused so much trouble for all of us, and even Dua suffered great losses. Thank God, the clouds of despair have finally
lifted from our daughters, and they can now smile freely. That’s my fault too, Fehmida. I mean, if I didn’t drive the girls
away from myself with my taunts then… then this tragedy wouldn’t have occurred. You’re right. May God write only happiness
in our daughters’ fates now. Amen, amen. What are you all discussing?
Tell me, too. Your mother is planning to host a dinner. A dinner for whom? For the children. I’m thinking of hosting a dinner at home and inviting Dua, Ghaznavi,
and Wasif over tomorrow. That’s a great idea. I’ve only met him as the principal, but now I’ll get to meet him
as my brother-in-law. Yes, you can meet him. Now, ask your mother what
to bring for the dinner. Make a list for me, and I’ll get
everything from the market. I’ll make it. I’ll make dessert. Dad likes my trifle, right? Yes, I love your trifle. It’s the best dessert in the world,
believe me. Alright, you make it then. Happy now? Yes, I’m happy. May God keep you happy, dear. Amen. I don’t feel like leaving you. You’ll be back by evening, right? Then go now. Yes, I’ll go for now. Anyway, it’s only a few days before I’ll be able to get
your undivided attention. Why’s that? Because soon,
someone else will come along to share you with me. Oh, is that so? Yes, it’s exactly like that. Hmm. No one can take your place. Well, then, hold on to that thought. Otherwise, there will be
a big fight between us later. I won’t let a fight happen. Okay, go to the office. Bye. Bye. -Take care.
-Hmm. Listen! I love you. I love you too.
