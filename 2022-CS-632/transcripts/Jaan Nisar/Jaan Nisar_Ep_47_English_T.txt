[81.08] Isn’t Dua meeting her brother-in-law 
a lot these days?
[85.52] Any special reason behind it?
[91.80] I am surprised, Nosherwan,
[94.04] she started showing her true colors
[96.72] as soon as you disappeared 
from the public view.
[110.00] Tell me one thing,
[112.04] do you ignore the mistakes of 
your second wife like you ignore me?
[118.52] Where did you get these pictures from?
[120.56] I had to get them made,
[122.72] otherwise you wouldn’t have 
believed me without proof.
[130.96] Nosherwan, you mistook 
a wildflower for a lotus,
[135.00] picked it up from the dirt, 
and decorated it on your collar.
[143.24] You must realize it yourself,
[146.12] that girl is not worth it, Nosherwan.
[219.08] You have become very famous,
[222.64] and lots of news are 
spreading about you.
[229.96] What news?
[234.04] Exactly what you have hidden from me.
[239.24] I didn’t hide anything from you.
[246.28] You are expecting a baby and
[252.44] almost the entire city knows
[255.44] but you didn’t bother telling me.
[261.40] I haven’t told anyone yet.
[263.92] Then how does the entire city know?
[267.88] I don’t know,
[268.84] I didn’t tell anyone,
[270.96] I even went to the doctor with my mom.
[272.64] Oh,
[273.68] so that means you have also
 visited the doctor already?
[277.12] And I am still unaware, wow.
[280.92] I tried telling you but 
you weren’t in a good mood.
[284.24] Yeah, so you won’t tell me anything
if I am in a bad mood?
[289.28] I tried but…
[293.08] Who told you this?
[295.36] No one knows it except my mom.
[299.56] Oh!
[301.12] So, what do you think
[303.16] I won’t find out anything if you don’t tell me
 or your mother does not tell me.
[309.08] When did I say that?
[313.16] Hmm.
[315.40] Your family is already hiding 
a lot from me these days.
[320.48] What?
[325.84] I will tell you when it’s the time.
[370.00] Why didn’t you tell me that 
you were coming to the office?
[372.20] Surprise.
[373.36] How come you are here?
[376.44] I came to meet Sarfaraz.
[381.44] I didn’t get it.
[384.08] He is my brother-in-law,
[385.96] Fiza’s husband.
[390.52] Fiza’s husband?
[393.04] It was just yesterday that I found out
[395.40] that he is an employee in your company,
[398.36] so I thought I’d meet him as well
now that I am here.
[402.36] He doesn’t like meeting us.
[428.16] Why did you send the guards
and the driver back?
[430.84] People get worried and 
there is no space here as well,
[434.36] I don’t like it when the poor people 
are standing outside in the sun.
[437.52] I wasn’t expecting Sarfaraz for Fiza.
[441.56] It was Sarfaraz who had an objection 
to meeting you, right?
[445.12] Where did his objection go now? 
He is still my employee,
[447.76] though I thought he would quit 
this job after knowing the truth,
[452.76] but that didn’t happen.
[454.68] Let’s see.
[455.84] What happened? 
Did he say something?
[457.52] Did he misbehave?
[461.36] No, no,
[465.00] what would he say to me?
[468.08] He got quiet when 
he saw me as your wife.
[480.24] Nosherwan, you mistook 
a wildflower for a lotus,
[484.24] picked it up from the dirt, 
and decorated it on your collar.
[487.96] You must realize it yourself,
[491.04] that girl is not worth it, Nosherwan.
[524.48] Fiza?
[525.52] Dua, you please don’t come outside, okay?
[528.88] Why?
[529.80] You just,
[530.88] you just go and hide somewhere.
[532.12] Have you gone mad, why?
[534.08] Sarfaraz is outside.
[538.40] So?
[539.08] He doesn’t know you are back,
[541.72] it would be very bad for me 
if he finds out, please.
[544.16] Nothing bad will happen.
[547.04] Please hide, please.
[548.80] Why should I hide?
[551.20] For my sake, please hide.
[553.92] You don’t know Sarfaraz.
[559.48] Fiza?
[561.52] Yes?
[566.56] I was going to the office,
[569.04] I thought of informing you.
[578.88] How are you?
[583.68] I am in front of you.
[592.72] He is an employee 
at Nosherwan’s company,
[595.56] I have already met him,
[601.68] didn’t you tell her?
[605.76] Yes,
[608.52] I didn’t get a chance to tell Fiza that
[613.04] we know each other.
[620.32] I mean to say that
[622.48] we have already met each other before.
[630.92] She is the wife of my boss,
[633.36] so I met her there.
[641.20] Anyway, you didn’t even want to tell me,
[643.92] I saw her here and found out that 
she is Dua and she has returned.
[655.64] Anyway,
[657.96] I will leave now,
[659.40] I am getting late for the office,
[661.92] Boss is also not here 
these days by the way,
[668.28] he is out of the city
[670.88] so the workload has increased.
[676.00] Bye.
[687.00] He already met you before
[688.88] and he didn’t even create 
a fuss about it,
[690.92] how did that happen?
[695.28] Status.
[698.48] Status keeps a person’s tongue 
as a possession.
[702.64] The situation would have been different
[705.52] if it was an ordinary girl standing in front 
of him instead of his Boss’ wife.
[710.76] It’s different today.
[711.88] I thought all hell would break loose when 
he finds out about you and when he sees you.
[717.16] Sarfaraz didn’t do anything.
[720.68] He can’t do anything.
[724.16] Hmm,
[726.88] don’t be scared, hmm?
[729.44] Come, let’s go outside.
[735.44] The members of the meeting 
have started to come,
[738.44] there is a meeting in the board room
in 15 minutes and then lunch.
[744.16] Hmm.
[756.68] Jaffar, actually…
[759.36] Yes, sir?
[763.28] I need all the information 
about Sarfaraz.
[768.08] Sarfaraz?
[776.52] What is it?
[779.40] You've never been shocked by 
anything I've said before like this.
[787.24] What is so special about Sarfaraz, sir?
[792.60] Tell me openly what is it?
[794.16] No,
[797.12] actually Madam also asked me
to get information about him,
[806.28] and today you are saying so.
[810.88] It means there is something
special about him.
[815.92] When did Dua ask you to do so?
[817.76] A few days ago,
I told her that
[822.32] Sarfaraz works in your company
[824.96] so she was very surprised,
[831.72] then she told me
[834.60] he is her brother-in-law.
[840.92] But Madam asked me not to 
tell you all this.
[854.16] She was saying maybe 
it’s some family matter.
[861.80] When the family didn’t introduce them
[866.68] then how did Dua find out that 
Sarfaraz is her brother-in-law?
[869.80] Yeah, that I don’t know.
[873.88] That is what I am asking you to find out.
[878.20] But one more thing, sir,
[883.96] a few days ago, 
Sarfaraz also came home
[893.08] and Madam especially told the watchman
that no one should find out about it.
[925.32] I need complete information 
about both of them.
[931.32] Whatever you say, sir.
[934.04] I will leave now.
[947.96] It means what I figured out was right,
[951.52] they know each other from before.
[962.64] It feels so nice
[964.12] that we are all together after so long.
[965.88] Hmm, really.
[968.16] Thank God that He united us again.
[976.48] And to be honest, I used to miss Dua 
very much on every occasion.
[987.48] Now I am with you guys.
[991.32] Forever, my child, forever.
[997.84] For how long can the river 
stay away from the sea? Yeah?
[1000.72] You had to come back to us
[1002.36] and I am very happy 
that you are back.
[1004.96] Oh!
[1006.16] I left the tap open, my child,
I will be back in a minute.
[1013.04] He is very happy today.
[1016.88] Bad days have passed,
[1019.20] everything will be good now.
[1022.32] By the way, I am surprised by 
Brother Sarfaraz’s behavior,
[1026.52] he didn’t do any drama 
when he saw Sister.
[1036.92] Tell me about it, how surprised I was.
[1039.32] I was so scared.
[1044.28] Yeah, by the way, both of you are right.
[1047.68] The way sister Kausar and Sarfaraz 
had made Dua their practice of cruelty,
[1053.16] I didn’t think that they won’t
publicize this matter.
[1061.20] By the way,
[1062.48] how did Brother Sarfaraz change 
so much, Sister?
[1069.24] I am very surprised myself.
[1071.20] Dua told me that Sarfaraz works 
at Brother Nosherwan’s office,
[1076.72] so this must be the reason.
[1080.32] You are right,
[1081.92] otherwise, Sarfaraz is not so nice 
that he would stay quiet.
[1092.28] It means that Brother Nosherwan 
should be praised for this as well,
[1102.48] a person like Brother Sarfaraz was 
speechless because of his power.
[1111.36] Hey,
[1113.32] haven’t you started talking big lately?
[1116.72] I am saying what’s true, 
Mom, right, Sister?
[1178.96] Come, Brother Sarfaraz, come.
[1181.04] Come.
[1186.12] What is it?
[1187.64] Don’t you greet people?
[1190.48] Greetings.
[1192.32] -Sit, I will call Fiza. 
-Hey,
[1195.60] why do you need to go? 
You sit down.
[1205.64] Sania will tell her,
[1206.88] and I have met you very little anyway.
[1210.64] My child, go and tell Fiza 
that I am here,
[1213.08] ask her to make a good cup of tea,
and then get ready to go, yeah?
[1216.92] Meanwhile, let me put in 
a request for my promotion.
[1222.80] She is the lady boss,
[1225.12] Ghaznavi might agree 
if I ask her for it.
[1240.76] Sit down.
[1248.68] Why so rude that you don’t even
want to talk to me?
[1256.52] Those days aren’t very old right now,
[1259.44] we used to talk on the phone
with each other,
[1261.60] and you used to wait for my calls.
[1263.08] Shut!
[1264.48] Shut your mouth!
[1270.76] By the way,
[1272.08] you can still wait for me if you want.
[1279.60] I will break your face 
if you say a word more.
[1283.04] Is it that easy?
[1285.48] Yes.
[1288.56] You are still the same,
[1294.48] you haven't changed a lot.
[1295.80] You immediately get angry.
[1297.52] You are my sister’s husband,
[1300.32] you should be ashamed.
[1302.24] Ashamed?
[1304.20] Why ashamed? In fact,
[1306.08] I consider myself fortunate 
that both the sisters…
[1308.32] Greetings.
[1312.28] You immediately made the tea?
[1314.20] Yes, I kept it on the stove as soon as 
I heard the sound of your bike.
[1318.36] Look,
[1319.44] your sister takes such good care of me.
[1321.32] My sister is very nice,
[1323.48] she takes care of everyone,
[1326.28] I wish you would have 
also taken care of her.
[1335.28] Anyway, you guys sit,
[1337.16] I will be right back.
[1356.80] No, no, just don’t add sugar,
[1358.48] I will have it as is.
[1364.12] -Greetings, Brother. 
-Greetings.
[1367.28] Greetings.
[1368.80] Greetings.
[1371.00] What is it?
[1372.44] Aren’t you inclining a little too much
towards your wife these days?
[1384.80] You also took her to her parents’ house
in the morning
[1386.96] and now you are also bringing 
her back after the office, hmm?
[1402.88] Fiza,
[1404.60] didn’t you tell Mom that 
your sister has returned?
[1409.92] Sister who?
[1411.84] That Dua?
[1419.24] Yes, Mom, Dua.
[1425.04] None of your other sisters ran away, right?
[1432.92] Dua, she is back.
[1435.40] Didn’t you tell Mom?
[1436.76] Why would she tell? 
She is so cunning,
[1439.44] wouldn’t she get blisters on her mouth?
[1448.24] It’s surprising
[1450.32] that such people keep the sisters back, 
who ran away.
[1464.68] How did you take her to meet her sister?
[1467.96] And you didn’t bother telling us, hmm?
[1473.60] At last, you have become like your wife.
[1475.68] Hey, by the way, it’s very sad
[1478.72] that you don’t know your son, 
what do you think
[1481.24] I will just become like anyone,
you think I am that weak?
[1489.24] So then how did you 
take her to meet her?
[1491.56] You used to hate dropping her 
off at her parents’ house.
[1494.96] What can I say, 
I have to do it,
[1497.04] it is due to some compulsions.
[1500.80] What compulsion?
[1506.60] Madam Dua has become 
a very rich lady,
[1518.20] she is the wife of my boss.
[1520.52] Hunh?
[1523.20] She directly trapped your boss after 
coming out of the police station?
[1535.24] Such girls are very gutsy, Mom,
[1540.12] otherwise how come every man would 
make utmost effort to praise her?
[1552.08] Yes,
[1553.16] and that is the reason why 
you see me working so hard,
[1557.36] it is because of this.
[1558.88] I will lose my job 
if she complains about me.
[1593.08] I don’t know how did you get there 
or why did you get there,
[1597.36] and I don’t even want to know
[1599.56] but it’s different if you want to 
tell me something yourself.
[1602.16] I trusted an ill-bred,
[1607.16] I don’t have anything more to tell you.
[1613.84] Do you want him to get to 
your knees and apologize?
[1617.08] Just tell me his name and identity once,
[1620.44] and after that, you can give him 
whatever punishment you want.
[1626.00] No,
[1630.12] I don’t want to have any relationship 
with any memory of my past.
[1639.80] Jaffar, you got very late.
[1643.72] Sometimes to explain 
the most difficult things of life,
[1648.72] we have to be late on purpose, Sir.
[1653.60] No matter how bitter the truth is,
[1657.56] I am ready to listen to it.
[1659.44] Your doubt was right, sir.
[1662.72] Sarfaraz and Madam knew 
each other from before.
[1669.08] Tell me in detail.
[1671.24] Sir,
[1673.00] Sarfaraz was behind everything 
that happened to Madam.
[1684.24] They used to love each other.
[1694.16] The night when Sarfaraz had his wedding,
[1697.60] he went to Aunty’s flat and sold Madam
on the same evening.
[1707.60] I was praying that my suspicion
proves to be wrong
[1712.76] but look…
[1715.24] Sir, you control yourself.
[1719.48] I am fine, Jaffar.
[1721.08] For the first time in my life,
[1723.52] I felt like lying to you and giving you
false information, sir,
[1732.56] so you don’t have to go through 
the pain you are going through.
[1744.04] The truth reveals itself someday, Jaffar.
[1747.00] Why did Madam hide it from you
[1750.32] that Sarfaraz is that person?
[1754.72] Only your madam can answer this.
[1763.40] You may leave, Jaffar.
[1764.96] But Sir…
[1765.92] I am fine, Jaffar, you may go.
[1769.36] Okay, sir.
[1783.92] I came to meet Sarfaraz.
[1786.00] He is my brother-in-law,
[1787.84] Fiza’s husband.
[1789.24] Fiza’s husband?
[1790.60] It was just yesterday that I found out
[1792.92] that he is an employee in your company,
[1795.24] so I thought I’d meet him as well 
now that I am here.
[1827.56] Ghaznavi hasn’t responded 
since last night,
[1831.68] he never ignores my calls.
[1850.64] Dua?
[1853.76] My child, when is Ghaznavi coming back?
[1858.08] Why?
[1859.12] Are you tired of me?
[1860.88] No, I am just asking.
[1865.12] I don’t know,
[1866.12] I was also calling him to ask this.
[1870.52] Is everything all right?
[1872.92] Did you guys fight?
[1875.52] Fight?
[1877.16] Ghaznavi never fights.
[1880.24] He must be busy, don’t you worry.
[1884.28] May God bring him back safely.
[1886.24] Amen.
[1887.96] Ghaznavi has to come back today
[1890.76] so I was thinking to go back home.
[1893.04] Why, my child?
[1895.08] What will you do alone at home?
[1896.92] Go back with him when he is here.
[1900.84] That would be fine too.
[1901.80] Okay, I will go offer prayers, it’s time.
[1903.92] Listen,
[1905.32] pray for me.
[1907.20] I always pray for you.
[1949.04] Sir,
[1949.92] we have our flight back home 
in the evening today.
[1954.40] Get it canceled.
[1956.24] Okay, so,
[1958.56] for when should I get the next one?
[1962.16] I will tell you when I plan to go back.
[1965.44] Madam is calling me again and again.
[1971.76] Listen to what she wants to say.
[1974.08] Okay.
[1977.68] Greetings, Madam.
[1979.24] Greetings.
[1980.36] Thank God you attended my call
[1982.12] otherwise, Ghaznavi is 
not picking up my call.
[1984.28] Yes, he is in a meeting.
[1987.16] Umm, you guys have
your flight today, right?
[1990.24] No, madam, it’s not confirmed yet.
[1997.44] Okay,
[1998.64] make me talk to Ghaznavi 
when he gets free from the meeting.
[2004.28] Okay, sure.
[2008.08] Bye.
[2009.16] Bye.
