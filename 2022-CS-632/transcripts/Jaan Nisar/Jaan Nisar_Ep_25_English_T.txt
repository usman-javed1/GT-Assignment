[24.68] Hello.
[25.76] Hello, Rumi, how are you?
[28.48] Leave me, you tell me, are you fine?
[31.16] Thank God.
[33.12] You sound worried, 
is everything okay?
[35.52] Man, I am really worried.
[37.88] Thank God I got through on your number.
[40.00] I was worried all night long about whether 
I would be able to talk to you or not.
[44.56] Why the emergency?
Is everything okay?
[48.08] Everything is fine in this ordeal.
[50.00] Anyway, you answer me.
[53.32] Yes, yes, go ahead.
[55.04] Did Zunaira contact you?
[59.56] Yes.
[61.12] When?
[62.56] A few days back.
[64.68] What was she saying?
[66.48] The same that is in her nature, what else?
[69.32] Did you talk to Nosherwan about this?
[72.40] No,
[74.76] I don’t think so. 
I didn’t tell him anything.
[79.48] I don’t find it to be right. Then,
[82.16] I don’t take what Zunaira 
says seriously, either.
[85.12] Man, Dua, this negligence of yours can 
become a big problem for you one day.
[90.52] What do you mean?
[91.84] Meaning, Zunaira was talking to someone
on a call about bringing you back here.
[100.16] And you know what?
[101.44] She also took a big sum of money for it.
[106.92] She took money?
[108.36] Yes, and her calling you also 
indicates the same thing.
[114.72] Who did she make a deal with?
[117.48] I don’t know anything.
[118.88] I just heard her talking 
to someone on the phone.
[124.52] She didn’t take that person’s 
name even once,
[126.92] so, I don’t know who called.
[131.52] Okay…
[133.40] Dua, I am really worried for you.
[137.48] You…
[138.84] You don’t worry because of me.
[141.48] I feel you should tell Nosherwan
 everything about this.
[146.72] I will think about it. You…
[148.44] you just take care
[150.56] and find out and tell me 
who she made a deal with.
[154.84] Yes,
[155.84] I will find out, but you take 
a lot of care of yourself.
[158.92] I don’t know what game 
Zunaira wants to play this time.
[162.92] You relax,
[164.08] I will see everything. Okay?
[167.96] Okay,
[169.16] bye.
[174.16] If he finds out
[176.24] what you did with Mr. Sarkar.
[179.24] He is a man.
[180.84] Who's going to convince him
[183.64] that you are still a pure girl?
[198.96] I will meet you really soon after 
fulfilling all the legal requirements.
[203.48] I will wait.
[204.76] I will take my leave now.
[207.40] Bye.
[208.48] Bye.
[212.24] Greetings Baba Saeein. 
Greetings. Live long. Live long.
[215.52] How are you feeling?
[216.44] Thank God. Thank God. 
I am better.
[218.68] What legal requirements 
were you talking about?
[221.24] Has there been any dispute 
over the land?
[224.12] You are here, Nosherwan. 
Greetings, mama.
[226.08] Greetings. Live long. Sit. 
Sit.
[230.88] Yes?
[234.36] I had called the lawyer 
to get my will written.
[242.36] Baba,
[244.44] may God give you a long life.
[247.12] What is the need of the will?
[252.40] There was a need,
[254.32] that’s why I did it.
[255.56] Baba Saeein, that’s what I am asking
what is the need?
[260.12] Zawar is no longer with us.
[262.60] You've become a city dweller.
[267.64] After me,
[269.60] the women of the mansion 
will be left alone.
[272.96] I had to think about them too.
[279.32] Then there are Zawar's belongings.
[281.88] we have to think about them too.
[285.32] You should surely think about it.
[287.72] After Brother Zawar, whatever remains
 belongs to his children.
[293.76] But wealth can never replace a person.
[298.16] You are right.
[299.72] But you can't deny the importance 
of wealth either, can you?
[306.32] After me,
[308.88] your Amma Saeein will handle 
all the matters of this mansion.
[317.80] May God protect you, 
and may He give you a long life.
[321.40] Why are you saying these things?
[323.36] You have to go when the call comes.
[327.04] Baba Saeein, don’t say these things.
[331.88] Everyone is so worried about
you over just a little illness.
[335.12] I'm sure the kids must be 
very anxious seeing you like this.
[337.92] I am worried about them.
[344.64] Why don’t you take Kashmala 
and the children along with you?
[354.52] No, Baba Saeein,
[357.12] then how will you two live alone over here?
[365.08] And I think they will not be 
able to adjust there.
[371.96] Kashmala and the children 
are your responsibility.
[375.68] Yes, I understand that 
they are my responsibility.
[379.96] When I came last time, I gave a suggestion,
what happened to it?
[386.08] I had tried to talk,
[391.64] but she is not ready to 
hear anything in this matter.
[394.80] We cannot force her, right?
[401.44] Once you get better,
[404.04] we will talk about all this. 
Leave it right now.
[408.40] You married that girl informing her 
that you have a wife and children.
[415.24] Yes, Baba Saeein, I had told her
[418.44] the condition under which 
I accepted this relationship.
[425.76] Then what is the difficulty?
[427.76] There is no difficulty, Baba Saeein.
[430.28] Right now, your health is more important.
[436.92] And if things aren't improving
 with the doctors here,
[439.04] come with me. 
I'll get your checkup done in the city.
[442.24] Please take care of your health.
[445.48] We will talk about all this some other time.
[447.40] You only live as much as life allows, right?
[454.80] You just don’t be negligent about here.
[464.72] That’s why I sent you a message
[467.40] and called you here so that I advise you.
[474.40] I don’t know why you are saying 
these things that stir up the heart.
[480.28] You will be fine.
[481.84] May God give you a long life, 
and may He give you health.
[507.40] How are you?
Absolutely fine.
[512.60] Live long.
[513.92] Since I heard this good news, 
I couldn’t resist and I came.
[519.08] Congratulations sister.
[522.36] Hey.
[524.44] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[529.24] These sweets?
[531.44] Did your daughter’s wedding get fixed?
[534.48] No, sister.
[536.44] The match wasn't suitable, 
the boy was too old.
[540.16] Yes,
[541.40] every daughter of yours cannot 
have a fate like our Fiza,
[548.64] who found both a good home
[551.40] and a good husband.
[560.24] You people, sit. I will bring tea.
[562.56] Sania, let’s make tea, 
we will also talk. Come on.
[565.68] Come. Sit.
[567.72] You too sit.
[572.48] Sit. Sit.
[575.48] Now you need to rest more.
[579.40] As soon as brother told 
this good news to Fiza’s father,
[584.36] I couldn’t hold myself, 
I came running.
[587.48] What?
[589.80] Naseer gave you this news?
[592.96] Yes,
[594.32] should he not have given us this news?
[597.36] The decision of the fate of this child 
has still not been made,
[603.52] and Mr. Naseer has started telling the world.
[611.84] What?
[614.08] What do you mean?
[616.56] What decision?
[625.92] How are you, son?
[637.20] Sister Kausar, you were saying something?
[640.60] I didn’t understand you.
[643.32] Look, it is clear.
[645.96] After your daughter ran away from home,
[649.72] the character of both your daughters
 will be questioned.
[655.64] What question?
[658.12] If the good news comes 
in the home so soon,
[661.32] then the man will have a doubt in his heart.
[669.72] And at the time,
[671.32] when both of them are not even
 on good terms, either.
[681.12] Look sister, this is in the hands of God.
[683.80] Human will doesn't have much say in it.
[685.84] You are saying this,
[688.00] but if a man gets doubt in his heart once,
[691.08] then who can take it out?
[696.84] That’s why, Sarfaraz is not 
in favor of this child.
[711.48] Uncle, you are leaving so soon.
[713.40] I will not let you go so soon.
[715.24] Child, I will come back.
[717.24] Maazra is absolutely right,
[719.08] we will not let you go anywhere, uncle.
[721.56] Children,
[723.36] let uncle leave.
[726.84] Someone is waiting for him there.
[728.80] Who is waiting, uncle?
[733.96] The one who is more dearer to him 
than me and you, and everyone else.
[740.84] Such conversations are not 
appropriate in front of children.
[743.84] And what you have done,
[745.96] by bringing her between you and me?
[749.08] We had nothing between us,
[751.44] that you have such a problem 
with her coming in between.
[756.60] You called and saw for yourself.
[758.96] What did you gain?
[760.84] You two are playing 
the game of gain and loss.
[766.72] The one you married and 
brought home happily.
[769.68] Our fate?
[771.84] We are like incense sticks burned as needed,
[781.44] and in the end, we'll turn to ashes.
[790.16] We too will go with you, uncle. 
Yes, we too will go.
[792.84] No children, don’t insist.
[795.16] But, why?
Nosherwan,
[798.04] don’t worry.
[805.80] They are children, 
they are just like their mother,
[809.08] they will insist for a while, 
then they will cry and become quiet.
[813.00] You go without worrying, 
I will make them understand.
[820.68] I will wait for you Nosherwan,
[824.24] that maybe if you realize your 
mistake and you return back.
[836.52] Take care of yourself, children.
[838.08] You too.
[843.72] Go. Go to the room you two.
[845.64] Go.
[878.68] How can Sarfaraz raise 
a finger at Fiza’s character?
[884.44] You people should make him understand.
[888.40] Do you think
[890.24] I wouldn’t have tried making 
Sarfaraz understand?
[893.88] For the first time in this home,
[895.88] both father and son argued a lot, 
because of your daughter.
[905.48] Naseer dragged Sarfaraz out of the home,
[908.68] and Sarfaraz too,
[909.88] my child, left the home in his anger.
[913.96] I called Sarfaraz and pleaded 
with him to come back home,
[918.28] then he came back home.
[920.24] You people couldn’t control your daughters,
[922.52] so now what do you want?
[923.96] Should my son also get out of hand?
[929.04] We don’t want this at all.
[933.00] But, what you have said has worried me.
[936.00] Hey, we are the ones 
who have gotten worried.
[938.88] We got trapped forming a 
relationship with you people.
[946.12] Sarfaraz fears Naseer
[949.28] or else he would have left 
your daughter a long time back.
[1024.52] Man, Dua, this negligence of yours can 
become a big problem for you one day.
[1028.88] What do you mean?
[1030.24] Meaning, Zunaira was talking to someone 
on a call about bringing you back here.
[1035.08] And you know what?
[1036.28] She also took a big sum of money for it.
[1040.20] Dua, I am really worried for you.
[1042.36] I feel you should tell Nosherwan 
everything about this.
[1045.60] I don’t know what game 
Zunaira wants to play this time.
[1066.72] Madam.
[1071.52] Is sir back?
[1072.60] No, sir still hasn’t come yet.
[1077.56] Did he call?
[1079.48] No, he hasn’t called either.
[1083.60] Fine,
[1085.00] when he comes, inform me.
[1086.44] Yes, sure.
[1087.52] Should I make tea for you?
[1089.80] No, thank you.
[1092.32] I will make it myself.
[1094.12] Sure.
[1127.40] Why did you call again?
[1129.36] I had to call you to find out your answer.
[1134.08] Look, Zunaira,
[1135.72] on whosoever’s instructions 
you are playing this game will,
[1137.76] it will cost you a lot.
[1139.20] It will cost you a lot
[1142.00] if you don’t agree with me 
and go to Mr. Sarkar.
[1147.28] If you say anything for me from your tongue, 
then it will not be good.
[1154.00] What will you do?
[1155.68] Will you tell Ghaznavi?
[1158.20] Yes, I will tell him.
[1163.68] Tell him.
[1165.72] What I do after that,
[1169.80] you two won't even be able to face anyone.
[1173.88] I am not going to get scared
 of these threats of yours.
[1176.96] Hmmm…
[1178.28] threat?
[1180.16] Keep up this courage,
 it will be very useful.
[1185.04] When Ghaznavi sees your video
[1188.68] and takes you out of his life 
by divorcing you, himself,
[1192.24] then you will understand 
what I am saying.
[1197.20] What video?
[1200.72] I have the entire video of the night
 you went to meet your lover,
[1210.68] and I will make it viral 
if you don’t agree with me
[1214.64] and you don’t go to meet Mr. Sarkar.
[1221.60] Then I will see
[1223.84] how Ghaznavi keeps you with himself.
[1236.72] What did you think?
[1239.04] You will get saved from me so easily?
[1249.16] Now the decision is in your hands,
[1251.88] will you go to meet Mr. Sarkar,
[1255.16] or should I make your video viral?
[1267.44] I…
[1272.60] I was going to tell you. 
Relax.
[1278.20] You don’t need to be worried 
about anyone, with me around.
[1286.76] Especially don’t worry about people like her,
[1291.20] I am here.
[1298.24] I am going for something important,
[1300.28] I will be back in a little while.
[1303.40] Don’t worry.
[1345.56] You've been enduring so much alone,
[1349.12] without even telling us
[1351.36] what you're going through.
[1354.84] What would I tell you?
[1359.08] They are demanding me to prove 
the purity of my character.
[1370.36] Mama,
[1371.92] we have always lived a clean life,
 despite that, today,
[1377.80] fingers are being raised at my character.
[1384.16] I don’t understand what words I find,
[1390.04] using which I can prove myself 
to have a pure character.
[1392.88] I don’t understand.
[1394.68] I couldn’t even imagine that Sarfaraz 
and sister Kausar would say such things.
[1400.72] Mama,
[1402.56] people's understanding often 
surpasses our expectations.
[1410.72] And as for their tongues?
[1414.08] They have no limits.
[1416.84] What will happen?
[1421.20] Sarfaraz has told me that
[1425.32] if I don’t get rid of this child,
[1429.16] he will divorce me.
[1437.32] So, child, will you kill…
[1442.24] No. Never.
[1445.76] Even if Sarfaraz divorces me, 
and leaves me,
[1454.88] I will never harm my child.
[1466.72] These people are not worthy of you, sister.
[1469.36] You should come along with us.
[1476.56] You don’t change homes out of fear.
[1481.40] I will have to live here. I will stay here
[1485.68] and fight the battle for my child’s life.
[1489.64] How will you do all this, my child?
[1493.60] Sarfaraz is against it.
[1495.76] I will have to do it,
[1499.24] or else,
[1501.48] I will lose my child.
[1507.84] And what answer will I give 
on the Day of Judgment then?
[1532.20] When we won't be there…
[1536.04] What is the matter? 
You look really happy.
[1542.84] Yes,
[1544.64] I am really happy.
[1547.16] Also tell me the reason for this happiness
[1549.36] so I too get happy.
[1553.56] Yes, by the way,
[1556.40] this news will make you happier than me.
[1560.04] How is that?
[1563.12] Your beloved, dear friend is coming back.
[1569.00] Dear friend?
Yes.
[1572.04] Dua.
[1576.16] Dua?
[1578.12] Why would she come back here?
[1580.36] Nosherwan took her from here
with great respect.
[1583.20] You had received a proper price for Dua.
[1585.76] Yes,
[1587.32] he took her with a lot of respect, 
paying the price.
[1593.04] But I have understood one thing
[1598.12] she is a hen that lays gold eggs.
[1603.40] If I am getting a higher price for her, 
then why should I say no?
[1607.08] Price?
[1609.36] What price?
[1611.48] And why do you think that 
Nosherwan will leave Dua, easily?
[1619.52] What do you think?
[1623.68] I am unaware of girls like you and Dua.
[1630.76] If we don’t have a weakness for the one,
[1634.36] we want to keep in captivity,
[1640.56] then won't our business shut down?
[1644.68] What weakness of Dua do you have?
[1649.60] I have one.
[1652.36] Will you also hide it from me?
[1654.56] How will I reach her weakness, 
even after knowing the truth?
[1657.68] You know, I am loyal to you.
[1660.48] The video of that room,
[1664.96] where Dua went to meet 
her lover for the first time.
[1672.00] This is such a weakness,
[1674.76] that when it gets viral,
[1676.96] Ghaznavi’s love will turn to ashes.
[1700.32] And he will not even take 
a minute to leave Dua.
[1703.48] You are mistaken.
[1709.80] What is all this?
[1712.92] You are packing all your belongings
[1714.80] and going away from this city, 
right now, this very moment.
[1718.52] On whose orders?
[1723.28] My order.
[1731.16] This cannot happen.
[1734.24] What hooliganism is this?
[1737.00] Should I call the police?
[1738.96] Shamsher, guards, 
where have they all gone?
[1741.24] No one will come.
[1743.68] Everyone is outside nursing their bones.
[1751.96] Video?
[1755.64] What video?
[1760.20] Don’t waste time in useless talk,
[1763.16] or you’ll lose your life.
[1765.92] Where is the video?
[1773.08] In the locker.
[1775.08] Jaffar.
[1777.16] Come on.
[1780.92] Take me to the locker.
[1784.00] Come on.
[1823.12] Anything else?
[1825.48] Everything is in this.
[1829.80] You have two days.
[1833.56] Leave from here.
[1842.36] Because not just seeing your face,
[1846.48] I wouldn’t even want to hear 
your voice after today.
[1855.12] Try that I don’t see your shadow anywhere,
[1861.52] or you won’t be spared.
[1905.44] Mama and Sania had come to meet you.
[1910.56] But you didn’t stay,
you didn’t meet them.
[1914.72] Is it not enough that I am tolerating you?
[1921.16] They are your in-laws.
[1922.92] So?
[1926.52] You give a little importance 
to the guests who come home,
[1929.40] especially if they are so close.
[1932.64] Fiza, what is your problem? Huh?
[1937.84] I mean, what do you want from me? 
Why do you get after my life?
[1942.08] I...
[1944.52] I am trying to make you 
understand something, this time.
[1947.20] No, you will make me 
understand now? Huh?
[1950.32] You have become really sensible?
[1952.08] Lower your voice.
[1952.92] Please, if someone hears you 
what will they think?
[1954.60] Why should I lower my voice?
[1956.32] It is my home.
[1957.56] Let whoever understand 
whatever they want to understand.
[1962.56] And you need to understand one thing,
[1964.72] if you have no worth in front of me,
[1967.80] then what will be their worth?
[1970.04] Sarfaraz, they are my own.
[1972.72] They have been hurt a lot by your behavior.
[1975.00] Yes, so I have not taken up the responsibility
 to keep everyone happy over here.
[1979.36] And understand one thing.
[1981.20] Leave your teacher attitude at school,
[1983.40] don’t bring it to this home.
[1985.32] No need to order me around.
