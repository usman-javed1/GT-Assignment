Here. Take care of yourself too. You are there to take care of me. You will have to take care of yourself. You will have to manage
 things yourself, now. I cannot. You are there to care for me. After all, I get really alone without you. What happened? Where did you get lost? Huh? No, nowhere. Nowadays, you have 
started to stay really lost. Is it work-related stress? Yes, I am just a little busy. You came late, even last night and then you slept without having dinner. No, I had food with friends. Aren’t friends starting to take on 
too much importance in your life? Baba Saeein, you? Live long. My Baba Saeein and Amma Saaein. You people are here all of a sudden? Why? Did you not like our surprise? No, I meant had you told me, I would have sent Jaffar, you wouldn’t have had
 trouble on the way. Had we told you earlier, how would we have seen
 this surprised face of our daughter-in-law? Daughter-in-law, cover your head with your scarf 
and greet Baba Saeein. Yes. Greetings. Greetings. Live long. Greetings. Stay happy. You didn’t bring daughter-in-law to meet us, so we came to meet her ourselves. Did you do well. Come, please have a seat. I will ask the servant and get something to eat. Why the servant? I will go myself. No need to get into any formality. It is our own home. After all, we left home after having breakfast. We just came to see our children. What is the formality in this? You people have come
 home for the first time, you will have to eat something. I will just come. She is good. Come, please, have a seat. No need to get so worried, it is our own home. Bano, everything is ready, right? Yes, Madam. Nothing should be left lacking and you have to serve the food hot. Okay? And yes, did you prepare the pudding? yes, it is ready. Good. Only serve the pudding 
when it is really cold. Ghaznavi really likes it, okay? And you also have to 
garnish the food really well. I mean, decorate 
the food well and bring it, and you have to décor
 the table really well too. Okay? Yes, sure. Madam, when do I serve food? I am just calling Ghaznavi, but please check the kitchen carefully, nothing should be left lacking. Yes, sure. Daughter-in-law everything 
you got made is really good. Not yet, if I had known you
 people were coming, I would have tried to
 make it even better. You did so much, even this was enough. But, how did you find
 out what we like? Nosherwan told me. Uh-huh. In our family daughters-in-law, don’t take their husband’s name like this. Okay, I will be careful in the future. Live long. It has not been long since
 daughter-in-law joined us. She will learn gradually. Yes. Saeein, when do we have to leave? There is still time. If you want, you can rest a little. What do you mean? Will you people leave today? This is what we decided. No, Baba Saeein, stay for a few days. Yes, stay with us for a few days. Right now, we came in haste. We had something important to do. What important thing? I mean, you should have ordered
 me from the mansion, the work would have been
 done, Baba Saeein. It was necessary to come. You two don’t worry, we will come again. This time, we'll come with leisure and have you serve us too. I will wait. Okay, you people sit. I will go ask for the kehva. I will come with you. Please, come. Baba Saeein, on the way… Why is he disconnecting my call? Answer it. It could be an important call. No, it is not that important. I was saying did you face 
any discomfort on the way? No. I had an idea that if Nosherwan
 has chosen someone, then they would 
have something special. Now seeing you and meeting you, I am thanking God that my thinking was not wrong. When we come next time, we will meet your mother 
and the rest of your family. All of them would also be 
really happy to meet you. You know, when I had not met you people, I was really scared thinking how you people would react. When Nosherwan 
made you his respect, then what is there to be scared of? Dua, you are happy with Nosherwan, right? Yes. And Nosherwan? Is he happy with you? Yes. Maybe. Why, maybe? Don’t you have faith
 in your relationship? I don’t know. At times, I don’t understand anything. You know that Kashmala is Nosherwan’s 
wife before you, right? Yes. He did this marriage 
for our happiness, but he could never accept Kashmala. I used to be really worried that his heart had been broken. That’s why, when he expressed 
his desire to marry you, then we couldn’t oppose it a lot. Inside, even I too wanted my son’s heart to become
 full of life again. Again? Nosherwan is my son and I have brought him up. But, today, you have become
 our daughter-in-law, so I am making you understand, that, along with trusting 
your husband, blindly, it's also important to keep an 
eye on his day-to-day activities. Where he comes, where he goes, who he meets. You understand 
what I'm saying, right? Yes. No need to worry. Understand this well that along with Kasmala, you too are our daughter and we know how to fulfill
 the rights of daughters. I will just go and see what your Baba Saeein is doing. Yes, Nowadays, you have 
started to stay really lost. Is it work-related stress? Yes, I am just a little busy. You even came late last night, and then you slept 
without having dinner. No, I had food with friends. Aren’t friends starting to take on too
 much importance in your life? I don’t want to get married right now. Right now, they are only 
coming with the proposal. You will not get married immediately. I don’t want to go so far. Hey, girls dream of having their marriage proposals 
come from England or Europe, so they can proudly tell their friends that after marriage, they’ll be settling in America or England. I have never had such a desire. What is the matter, Sumbul? What would be the matter? Sumbul is worried about something. Bring me water. Greetings. Sorry. Where is your attention? I am sorry. No, tell me, what are you thinking? Can you do a single thing properly? I wasn’t paying attention. Really? Where is your attention nowadays? Sarfaraz, I… I am worried for Sumbul. Sumbul? Since when did you start 
getting worried for my sister? I feel she is not ready for this proposal. Did Sumbul say this to you? I felt by her demeanour, that she… Why did you feel this? Why did you feel this? It hurts a lot, leave it. No need to be worried for my sister. But… But, what? Her brother is alive, right? Her parents are there, right? So, they will think about her. But, you stay away from her. Me. She is really dear to me, 
like my own sisters. I felt that she was not 
happy with this proposal, I said it to you, but you… Don't degrade my sister so much that you are comparing 
her to your sisters. She is not a bad character 
girl like your sisters. And in our family girls 
marry where the parents tell them to. They are not interested
 in running from home. You have drenched all my clothes! Hello. Where are you? Where will I be? Are you at home? Yes, why? Is Dua near you that you 
were disconnecting my call? Why were you calling? Why? Did you not like me calling? I mean to say, if there is something
 important, then tell me. We had to have lunch together today. You didn’t come. But I never made any 
such commitment with you. But I wanted it. I prepared everything
 with so much effort. All my effort went to waste. And you were so busy that you were not even answering my call or did you not see 
anything in front of Dua? Amma and Baba Saeein, are here. I am with them. Oh, I see. There you are enjoying 
a family gathering, and here, I have been sitting hungry
since morning waiting for you. So, you should have at least 
asked me before planning anything. Why did you plan it yourself? Meaning, I don’t even have
 so much importance that I can plan a surprise for you. Okay, relax. Relax, Farah. What is the big deal about lunch? We will have it together at any time. You know what, Ghaznavi? My emotions have 
no importance to you. You are with your family there, and I am completely alone here. Listen, Farah, what am I saying to you and what are you saying? I don’t want to talk to you. You know what? I hate you, Ghaznavi. I hate you. Hello, Farah. Farah! Mama, you? If you wanted something, 
then you should have called me. You were busy, so I came myself. Your Baba Saeein is calling you. Come on. Yes, I will come. What is the comparison
 between you and me? I am Ghaznavi’s wife, and you are just a friend. He used to love you. He used to, now he loves me. Okay. You know. I thought were unaware. It is all a fault of your thinking. Now see, you came like this 
after so many years, to tell some filmy 
story from university. You people have become mature. Move on, think of something else. Madam, should I serve food? Pick up this food and throw it out. And for God’s sake, 
leave me alone for a while. But… I told you, pick up the food and throw it out. Go, get lost. Okay. You are surprised to 
see us here suddenly, right? No Baba Saeein, 
why would I be surprised? This is your own home,
 you can come when you want. Hmmm. Anyway, you have surprised us. You have also embarrassed
 your Amma Saeein. I don’t understand. Even we were not able to understand. That’s why we came here so that we can get your answer. The answer to what question,
 Baba Saeein? Are you unaware or do you think we are unaware? What do you think you will do what you want
 sitting so far from the mansion and we will not find out about anything? No Baba Saeein, why will I think that? I know you are aware of everything. When you know, then why don’t you think once
 before doing all that, that when we find out, how embarrassed your 
Amma Saeein will be about your upbringing? What are you talking about?
 I don’t understand. You have brought back 
the past we had forgotten. You never accepted Kasmala, we stayed quiet. This girl who came into 
your life yesterday, whom we didn’t even know, you married her. We accepted her 
for your happiness. But now, where has Farah come 
from back into your life again? Fine, you are a man, you can get married
 more than one time. But these two are not 
my daughters-in-law, they are my daughters. And I would never want you to give any sorrow 
or torture to my daughters. Baba Saeein, 
there is nothing like you think. If there is nothing like that, then why have you been
 seen visiting Farah’s home? This is my first and last advice to you. Go. Okay. Mama, sister didn’t come today. Child, she would have a hundred
 things to do at her home too. She cannot visit here daily. Yes, that is true. We don’t even have a phone or we would have 
called and asked her. Why are you so eager
 to talk to your sister? Is there something special? No, there is nothing special. But you know how attached I am to
 my sister from the start, and now? Now I envy her fate. When she gets out of the big car, and those armed guards? When they guard the house, I can’t tell you how proud I feel. Thank God, some good deed came in use, that Dua found 
a life partner like Ghaznavi, or else God knows 
what would have happened. Truly. God has really blessed my sister. I want to meet Brother Nosherwan, I want to sit with him. I want to talk to him about a lot of things. Don’t express this interest 
of yours in front of Dua. When she finds it reasonable, she will introduce him to all of us. I don’t how he will be. What sort of temperament will he have? Does he even like Dua meeting us or not? Mama, if this was the case, then he wouldn’t let sister meet us. I pray to God that he 
is just like Dua tells us. Don’t worry, Mama. He will be like that. Hey Kausar, where is our daughter? Call Sumbul. Yes, I have told her. She is getting ready. Actually, she is coming in front of
 you people for the first time, so my daughter is a little anxious. I know. Girls get anxious on such occasions. Yes. There. Sumbul is here. Greet them. Greetings. Greetings, child. Have a seat. Come child, sit here. Come on. Hey Brother Naseer, 
you have met Fahad. If you want to investigate further, 
then you can surely do it. What are you saying, Hassam? Fahad is your son, and our daughter will go to your home, what could be better than this? What do I have to investigate? Then, Brother Naseer, do one thing, give us a date for
 this month for the wedding. As you wish. That’s it, then immediately order sweets and feed us. Yes, Fiza, bring the sweets. Sure. Congratulations to you all. Congratulations. Congratulations to you too.
 Congratulations. Here you go. Congratulations. Congratulations to you. Hey, feed everyone. My child. Are you fine? Yes. Hey child, why do you always 
get into this formality? What formality? Why do you always ask me? When you know this is my home and I can bring whatever I want. I know this. You have always been stubborn. You did well that you came. Sania was really missing you. I too miss her a lot. Where is that firecracker? Here. Hey, she is here. Hey, my doll. How is my doll? I am fine, how are you? Absolutely fine. You too are here. How are you? Absolutely fine. I came to meet you. Have a seat. We too are really happy that Papa forgave her 
and gave her permission to come home. No? Now she can come to us when 
she wants and we will meet her. Thank God. What happened? Why the sad face? I don’t know. I just feel as if I saw
 you after a long time. Have you gone mad? Tell me, how are you? I am good. How are you? Absolutely fine, and I miss you so much. I can’t tell you. I too miss you a lot. And does Brother Nosherwan take care of my sister or not? Hmm Listen. You don’t come to my home, and neither do you tell
 me about your in-laws’ home. Mama, you introduce her to her in-laws. I will request the
 brother groom to send her. When do those people send her? Sister has her last period free, so she takes time and comes. Even during that, she looks 
at the watch a hundred times so that she doesn’t get late. I would say that we will take your
 armed guards to sister’s in-laws. We will influence them a little. Who knows, maybe her mother-in-law 
and brother groom come on the right track. Sania, you have become so ill-mannered. What are you saying? Mama, look at her. Child, what is wrong? She is showing a little attitude. Let her.
