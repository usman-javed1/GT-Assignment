[25.48] It is fine. You can leave.
[37.40] What happened?
[39.16] Why did you take out my bags?
[41.48] I told him to do this.
[46.72] You?
[49.56] But why?
[52.16] You have your breakfast.
[53.44] The cars are ready outside.
[54.44] My driver will drop 
you at the mansion.
[56.84] Listen.
[60.72] Nosherwan,
[63.28] I came here to take care of you.
[67.36] Thank you very much,
[71.12] but I can care for myself.
[75.24] Put Madam’s bags in the car.
[83.76] Nosherwan,
[86.80] you are insulting me sending 
me forcefully from here, like this.
[92.44] No.
[94.68] I tried to let you leave yourself
[98.08] and that things don’t come to this.
[106.00] You find me to be so bad.
[109.24] You being here or not being 
here means nothing to me.
[113.80] It is not about finding
 you good or bad.
[120.08] I don’t understand.
[124.64] I don’t understand,
[127.68] how someone can be so difficult.
[132.16] Goodbye.
[162.20] What does she say?
[165.40] She does not agree.
[166.40] Then convince her.
[167.52] If we do what these
 girls say and think,
[169.36] then we will die of hunger.
[171.36] She is stubborn,
[172.60] it will take some time.
[174.16] Time is what we don’t have.
[176.52] Everyone is in 
search of new faces.
[179.92] There, Mr. Sarkar is sitting,
 filled with anger.
[183.52] He is saying to send it again.
[185.40] If her mind is in the right place,
[186.92] then I will send her anywhere.
[188.00] She will go and
 create a new scene.
[191.04] Today is the first day,
[194.04] she will agree soon.
[195.76] Then make her agree.
[199.32] And have you just kept
 this cigarette to blow smoke?
[202.64] Light it up
[204.24] and put it to use.
[206.60] Understand?
[212.16] Fine.
[214.24] Don’t worry.
[217.64] The work will get done.
[224.16] Rumi, what are you
 standing outside? Come in.
[229.08] What is she saying?
[232.28] She is showing tantrums.
[235.76] Although, she knows
[238.16] that there is no one here,
 who will tolerate her tantrums.
[242.32] You had bothered 
me the same way.
[248.16] I was stupid.
[249.80] And Dua is repeating 
the same stupidity.
[255.72] She will agree soon.
[258.28] Right now, she is not
 aware of the world outside.
[261.40] When she finds out,
[264.48] she will agree.
[269.92] She will agree.
[281.00] Go and shed your 
tears somewhere else.
[284.48] You have already spread 
misfortune in my life.
[286.80] Why are you doing this with me?
[288.68] Why am I doing this?
[289.88] After what you and your
 family did with me,
[292.92] I should get rid of you.
[294.68] And I will decide about you, right now.
[296.12] You will see.
[297.20] What are you saying?
[298.88] How many days have 
we been married?
[301.04] And you made 
my life hell in those days.
[305.72] I don’t have a fault in all this,
[308.04] I didn’t do anything.
[308.84] What are you punishing me for?
[310.16] No. No. The fault is mine.
[311.60] The fault is mine that 
I got married to such a family.
[314.08] Dua’s crime hasn’t 
even been proven yet.
[318.56] Believe me,
[319.72] I know my sister.
[321.00] She is not like that. No.
[321.92] Stop it!
[323.48] You are not like this,
[324.60] your sister is not like that,
[325.88] I am tired of hearing this.
[328.96] What happened?
[330.08] What happened?
[331.20] Why are you screaming?
[332.08] What will people think 
when they hear you?
[333.96] Mama, Papa didn’t do
 good by restricting me.
[336.40] Okay. Okay. Cool down.
[337.88] Cool down.
[338.92] Tell him
[340.44] I have become quiet today, but
[342.28] what I want will happen.
[348.60] What fight have you 
started in my home?
[352.16] You made both father and 
son stand in front of each other.
[355.64] I had brought you thinking 
that you would keep the home together,
[358.40] but you turned out to be 
someone who breaks the home.
[362.76] Now why are you crying 
like a cunning girl?
[364.84] Stop this drama. Quiet!
[422.12] Please agree.
[426.00] Never.
[428.32] Why are you becoming an 
enemy of your own life?
[432.80] Did you come here to scare me?
[434.60] No.
[435.76] In fact, I came to make 
you understand.
[438.68] Your endurance will 
have to kneel in front
[440.92] of the extreme injustice
 of these people.
[443.48] When you have to agree with them,
[445.80] then why torture yourself like this?
[447.72] Never.
[450.00] I will die, but I will 
never agree to them.
[453.88] They will even make
 your bones agree.
[456.44] I am your well-wisher,
[457.96] that’s why I am making
 you understand.
[460.12] All of you are the same, go from here.
[464.12] Dua, don’t insist.
[465.84] You don’t waste your time.
[468.52] You are only harming yourself.
[471.72] If you want to escape from here,
[473.68] then do exactly what I say.
[478.24] Why are you showing 
sympathy towards me?
[481.36] Because I have started 
to see myself in you.
[485.28] You are saying all this 
to convince me,
[488.60] but I will not agree.
[490.64] It is up to you.
[492.32] if you don’t want to trust me,
[493.88] then don’t.
[495.80] I too was like you.
[498.52] Stubborn.
[499.96] The only difference is that
[501.80] you were exploited 
in the name of love,
[505.12] while I was deceived under
 the pretense of marriage.
[508.96] In my family, love marriages 
were not allowed.
[513.68] I was already a rebel,
[516.68] and falling in love
[518.20] only intensified my defiance.
[521.52] I eloped under the cover of night 
with the promise of marriage.
[525.04] The man who was supposed
 to become my husband
[527.28] ended up selling me, Zunaira.
[530.36] Your lover has sold you to me,
[534.60] after taking the entire amount.
[538.12] I too was not agreeing to you,
[542.28] but I had to bow down 
in front of their injustice.
[544.48] I will die,
[545.24] but I will not agree
 with what Zunaira is saying.
[547.20] Don’t be mad, Dua.
[549.16] If you really want to 
escape from here,
[551.00] then do as I say.
[555.68] I cannot trust you.
[557.96] The condition you are in,
[559.76] perhaps if I were in your place then...
[562.12] I too wouldn’t have believed you.
[564.84] But, believe in me,
[567.24] I see myself in you.
[570.96] I had no one to save me,
[573.24] that’s why I got ruined.
[575.64] I want that
[578.44] I don’t let you get ruined.
[582.08] That’s why,
[583.36] when Zunaira comes, tell her that
[585.56] you agree.
[590.12] It is my responsibility to get you out 
of here, seeing the right opportunity.
[597.24] You can trust me this much, right?
[630.00] Saaein, Mr. Qasim called.
[633.96] He has invited you as 
a special guest to his party.
[639.68] Jaffar I wont go. Say no to him.
[645.00] Saeein, how can I say no?
[648.00] He is your close friend.
[651.68] He was saying
[653.32] he would call you himself.
[656.80] Fine, I will say no to
 him when he calls.
[661.52] By the way,
[664.68] I think you should go.
[677.80] Jaffar, I don’t feel like it.
[680.12] I apologize for the disobedience, Saeein.
[683.56] Since you have found out about that girl,
[687.28] you have been really hurt on the inside.
[690.84] I tried to search for her a lot,
[693.84] but I didn’t find out
 anything about her.
[696.24] I don't know if the earth swallowed her
[697.60] or the sky devoured her.
[701.36] No Jaffar,
[706.24] I will surely find that girl.
[710.52] My heart testifies.
[715.24] You know, I had seen her falling from 
a high place in my dream
[724.44] and then she had this accident.
[729.88] I feel I haven’t seen 
this dream for no reason.
[735.44] I surely have a connection with that girl.
[741.08] Saeein, when you
 didn’t tell her anything.
[745.00] I mean,
[746.68] when you don’t know her, then
[749.04] what sort of connection?
[753.00] That’s the thing.
[755.96] My heart wanted to
 make a mistake again,
[760.20] I have made it understand.
[764.56] But it refuses to understand.
[776.44] Okay Saeein, I will go now.
[806.44] Dua.
[808.72] Dua.
[810.08] What has happened to you? Dua.
[817.96] Dua.
[819.16] Dua, drink water.
[820.60] Dua. Dua, water.
[827.68] Why have you become your enemy?
[829.76] You will die like this.
[831.60] Let me die.
[833.36] Try and understand, Dua.
[835.48] Leave from here, please.
[837.28] Leave.
[840.04] Listen to me.
[841.80] I swear on my late mother
[844.64] that I will take you out of here.
[847.04] But give up this stubbornness.
[849.16] Drink water.
[882.48] You are her friend,
[883.48] you would know where she is.
[885.00] I was her friend, but not anymore.
[887.52] Who keeps friendships with girls,
[889.00] who have no respect in society?
[892.08] Where have you gone?
[893.88] I am unable to find out anything.
[895.80] Your own friend doesn’t 
want to talk about you.
[899.24] What has happened to you, Dua?
[902.28] I am worried further
 thinking about this.
[904.88] How and where do I search 
for you in such a big city?
[963.84] As soon as Rumi told me
[966.80] that you have agreed,
[969.36] then I took you out of the imprisonment 
without wasting a minute.
[974.12] Okay…
[976.40] Oh.
[978.32] Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
[981.76] This Bashir
[983.68] is really cruel and merciless.
[987.64] How he burned poor
 Dua so mercilessly.
[991.04] He showed no mercy.
[992.88] Tsk. Tsk.
[997.24] You must be in pain, right?
[1002.20] The food is here.
[1005.36] Hey, now I will make my Dua
[1010.52] eat food with my own hands.
[1013.32] We are not your enemies.
[1016.12] Yes?
[1017.32] Come on, have the food.
[1020.32] I don’t want to eat.
[1023.40] You will have to eat.
[1030.48] Your beauty will fade 
without eating and drinking.
[1036.36] You will lose your importance.
[1039.84] That’s why,
[1042.44] eat the food.
[1043.92] Eat the food!
[1049.12] Eat a lot.
[1057.16] Give me something in
 the name of God.
[1058.16] May God keep you happy.
[1059.40] Give me something in the name of God.
[1060.68] May God keep you happy.
[1064.64] Baba Saeein,
[1065.20] give me something in 
the name of God,
[1065.96] may God keep you happy.
[1082.36] Pray for me.
[1083.28] I pray to God,
[1084.24] may God keep you happy.
[1085.56] May God keep you happy.
[1088.00] May God keep you happy, sir.
[1102.00] Oh God,
[1104.24] make me meet her once.
[1107.84] Then I will never leave 
her alone to get lost.
[1112.80] This is my promise.
[1132.52] What happened? You still 
haven’t chopped the vegetable?
[1133.88] Hey, what is this?
[1135.24] Such thick peals of potato?
[1138.00] Did your family not teach
 you how to chop vegetables?
[1140.64] I try.
[1143.96] Okay tell me,
[1144.96] I have heard you used to do a job.
[1147.20] Yes,
[1148.76] I used to teach at a school.
[1151.28] So, what is the plan?
[1152.68] Since when will you join back?
[1154.00] Join back?
[1156.40] I had thought
[1158.08] I would go and resign now.
[1160.00] Resign?
[1161.60] Hey, why would you resign?
[1163.84] You have a good job,
[1166.24] and nowadays, you try tirelessly
[1168.20] but you don’t find a new job.
[1170.20] There is no need to resign.
[1172.76] I would say,
[1173.92] join in from tomorrow.
[1177.04] Sure.
[1179.56] Will Sister-in-law do a job?
[1182.04] If Papa finds out then,
[1183.92] Papa will get really upset.
[1186.16] Yes, so what if she does a job?
[1188.08] And you don’t worry
 about your Papa.
[1190.56] I know what I have to 
and what not to say to him.
[1193.72] You stay quiet.
[1195.92] And you.
[1197.24] Come on, it is getting late.
[1198.56] Chop the vegetables quickly,
[1199.76] I have to cook food.
[1200.76] Sure.
[1215.92] Brother,
[1219.04] it is clearly written on 
Sister-in-law’s face,
[1220.52] that she doesn’t 
want to continue the job.
[1224.52] So, why are you
 and Mama forcing her?
[1227.32] Who is forcing her?
[1229.56] Mama just said one thing.
[1232.20] Yes, but
[1233.52] Mama should ask 
her once for the job.
[1236.68] She should find out her will.
[1238.80] Mama directly gave 
her the order that
[1240.28] you have to go to
 the job from tomorrow.
[1241.76] Okay.
[1243.60] So, are we doing an injustice to her
[1245.72] that you have come to 
represent her here as a lawyer?
[1250.64] Hey, she used to do
 a job earlier too, right?
[1252.56] It was different earlier, Brother.
[1254.64] Now she is your wife.
[1256.64] Now you should take her for outings,
[1259.64] she should have 
a good time with you.
[1261.64] But you and Mama
[1263.40] have forced her to do a job.
[1266.32] Listen, remain within your limits.
[1268.04] Talk according to your age.
[1270.96] Do you understand?
[1272.60] It would be better for you,
[1274.08] you focus on your studies,
[1275.72] and let Mama make the
 decisions about the home,
[1277.56] she has also taken them earlier.
[1278.56] She knows what is right
 and what isn’t.
[1280.84] Understand?
[1312.16] Will you not give applause
 to my discerning eyes?
[1317.48] I could tell at first glance
[1320.44] that you are nothing ordinary.
[1325.52] And today everyone 
will say this seeing you.
[1332.76] Tell me the truth.
[1335.04] Have you seen yourself 
so beautiful before today?
[1342.36] No.
[1345.24] Bashir will deliver girls on time,
[1348.04] and do as I have told you.
[1350.88] Look,
[1352.16] don’t create a scene.
[1355.00] You know what I can do, right?
[1374.76] What is all this?
[1376.76] You had told me that you
would get me out of here.
[1379.56] Fix the expressions on your face, Dua.
[1382.64] Everyone including Zunaira should feel that
[1384.76] we are having a regular discussion.
[1386.16] To hell with Zunaira and all this.
[1388.28] You had sworn to me, right?
[1389.52] You swore on your mother,
[1390.72] you have forgotten.
[1393.12] I don’t forget anything.
[1395.40] then?
[1398.56] Have a little patience.
[1399.84] Now is not the right time.
[1401.36] When will the right time come?
[1403.48] How much more patience
 do I need to show?
[1405.28] Where are they sending
 me dressing me up like this?
[1409.16] I don’t know
[1410.52] if I find someone similar to
 that Seth or if I have to…
[1415.00] Luck is not that favorable
 every time, that
[1416.96] I can escape from there.
[1418.12] Nothing will happen, Dua.
[1420.44] Even after all this,
[1421.68] you are saying nothing will happen.
[1423.12] Yes,
[1423.96] I am saying this despite all this.
[1428.44] What do you think?
[1430.12] Why are they sending 
us dressed up like this?
[1436.80] I will run away.
[1438.72] Don’t ever make such a mistake
[1440.84] or else the feet you walk
 on and leave from here,
[1443.72] you will never be able to 
walk on them again.
[1450.24] If I stand here for long, then
[1451.84] Zunaira can doubt me.
[1454.04] I am your friend, not your enemy,
[1455.40] which is why do as I tell you to.
[1459.88] Change the expressions of your face,
[1461.60] and let whatever is 
happening, happen quietly.
[1463.88] Okay?
[1531.84] Hey, great.
[1533.76] Thank God you came
[1535.52] or else the way you agreed
 I thought you wouldn’t come.
[1538.96] If I make a commitment 
then I live up to it.
[1541.80] Yes, yes, I know.
[1543.28] You are true to your commitments.
[1545.40] Now, come on.
[1546.24] The party is waiting for you.
[1553.28] You know, I don’t like all this.
[1558.12] That’s why I avoid your parties.
[1560.56] Hey, try to understand.
[1562.16] It is a request of
 some special friends.
[1564.16] It is for their sake,
[1566.36] I have just called them 
for soothing the heart.
[1568.36] You also enjoy..
[1570.40] I will answer this call and come.
[1572.24] Jaffar you wait here.
[1574.88] Hello.
[1647.44] Where are you going?
[1655.96] I feel suffocated because of 
the stink of alcohol and smoke.
[1660.84] Okay,
[1663.88] you feel suffocated, right?
[1667.36] I will just call madam.
[1671.20] She will fix you.
[1678.24] Leave it.
[1700.44] Is this how you will talk to a girl?
[1702.24] Apologize!
[1703.56] Sorry, madam.
[1707.60] Forgive me, they are all my guards.
[1736.48] Jaffar.
[1739.96] How did Dua reach these people?
[1743.68] I will find out, Saeein.
[1777.36] Coffee.
[1778.88] Thank you.
[1780.48] I was making it for myself,
[1781.56] so I thought I would make it for you too.
[1783.68] I know you like tea but drink it now.
[1787.88] Not now.
[1790.24] Now I like the bitterness of coffee.
[1793.68] Any special reason?
[1798.84] Earlier life was not that harsh.
[1802.16] Nice answer.
[1804.56] By the way,
[1805.36] you got scolded by Zunaira
 as soon as you came.
[1808.32] The good thing is that
[1809.32] your mood didn’t get spoiled.
[1812.60] I have stopped giving Zunaira 
so much importance,
[1814.92] that my mood gets 
spoiled because of her.
[1818.12] Great.
[1819.64] You are quickly getting
 used to this environment.
[1822.80] Impression.
[1824.16] Used to this environment?
[1827.12] Never.
[1830.52] You remember you have promised
 to take me out of here, right?
[1834.24] I remember everything.
[1835.80] I am waiting for the right moment.
[1838.88] By the way,
[1840.08] tell me, where will you 
go leaving from here?
[1842.84] I mean,
[1844.00] will your own accept you?
