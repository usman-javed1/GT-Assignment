[45.64] Yes,
[48.12] is everything fine?
[51.60] Did Ghaznavi say anything else?
[54.24] How did you get inside my house
and who let you in?
[59.68] Why are you even asking
[61.32] how I got in and who let me in?
[64.52] Forget all that.
[70.80] You should realize that
[74.20] I don't care about my life.
[78.88] Even knowing everything,
[80.08] I still came inside to meet you.
[83.52] Look,
[84.76] leave Ghaznavi and come to me.
[89.44] Even today, I am waiting for you.
[91.16] Shut your mouth.
[92.52] I can keep my mouth shut,
[94.84] but what about my love?
[97.08] It keeps screaming your name.
[101.20] Look, Dua,
[103.96] I divorced your sister only because
you and I could be together.
[109.92] Try to realize this a little.
[112.12] Even if Ghaznavi leaves you,
[114.76] won't you come to me?
[117.80] After what happened today,
do you still think he won't leave you?
[122.20] That he will keep you?
[124.04] Soon all your misunderstandings
will be cleared.
[128.64] And now, I'm eagerly waiting for
the moment your pride breaks.
[135.76] I'll enjoy it.
[137.16] That will never happen.
[154.56] How dare he call me again after
everything that happened?
[161.76] Who is backing him
[164.92] that he isn't even afraid of Ghaznavi?
[191.68] No Ghaznavi!
[192.72] For God’s sake, please don't do it.
[196.96] Please don't kill him.
[198.28] Please,
[199.32] please, don’t do this.
[201.08] Do you see
[202.72] how much she still cares about me?
[227.32] I honestly don't know.
[228.76] I don't know how he got here.
[230.32] Now you’ll say this,
[232.08] the guard,
[232.88] the gatekeepers, they’re all lying.
[234.56] They said Sarfaraz
keeps coming to meet you,
[238.64] with your permission.
[272.72] I won’t turn to look
at your face again.
[423.92] Ghaznavi, please, listen to me,
[425.64] please.
[442.08] Ghaznavi, listen to me.
[443.88] Please, give me a chance to explain.
[445.68] Listen to me, please.
[447.52] Ghaznavi
[454.60] Don't you ever get tired?
[459.48] How bad is this?
[462.16] He's not even looking at you,
[464.72] and you're still running after him,
following him everywhere.
[468.76] Stop it already.
[470.80] He's not paying any attention to you.
[479.32] You're lucky that
Nosherwan has spared you so far
[481.64] and hasn’t thrown
you out of the house. Yet.
[490.72] You should be ashamed
of yourself by now.
[492.56] You should leave on your own.
[493.68] People do get ashamed
sometimes and leave.
[496.96] Won't you?
[499.32] Why are you troubling
me even more?
[501.32] Please, just leave.
[502.60] I told you
[505.04] I wouldn't let you live in peace.
[510.32] Look,
[511.36] the Nosherwan who used
to chant your name.
[515.28] Today, he doesn’t even
want to see your face.
[520.28] Why do I feel like you sent Sarfaraz?
[527.24] Even in so much tension,
your mind is still working.
[533.56] I didn’t send him.
[535.56] He’s your lover.
[536.88] Because of your deeds, he’s after you.
[539.08] How is that my fault?
[540.28] Enough!
[543.60] He’s after me not because of me,
[547.56] but because you sent him.
[551.40] Okay, let's assume for a minute
that I did send him after you.
[557.64] How will you prove it?
[560.04] Do you have any proof?
[562.24] Huh,
[564.52] I never thought you could stoop so low.
[569.12] Then that's your fault for
thinking that way, Dua.
[576.16] You are doing very wrong.
[577.60] You are the one
who wronged me, Dua.
[579.32] By coming into this home,
[580.92] by coming between me
and Nosherwan,
[587.68] I am just trying to right
the wrongs you’ve done.
[612.64] So what happened, dear?
[616.72] You don't look well. You look sick.
[618.40] Is everything okay?
[620.56] Nothing is okay, Mother.
[623.60] Sarfaraz has ruined my life.
[628.40] What has Sarfaraz done now, child?
[655.44] Child, when no one was at home,
[658.08] how was it possible
for him to come here?
[660.04] Mother,
[661.36] where Dua is, anything is possible.
[663.64] Why are you so surprised?
[666.92] When no one was home,
[669.24] it’s obvious that Dua must have
called Sarfaraz herself, right?
[673.32] Fiza,
[675.76] are you accusing me too?
[678.12] Accuse you?
[680.64] Why shouldn't I accuse you?
[682.64] If you can do so much,
why can't I say anything?
[689.92] I am suffering because of your actions.
[694.40] You ruined my home.
[698.24] You took my husband away from me,
[700.24] and now I shouldn't accuse you?
[705.60] Despite all my efforts, all my love,
[708.04] the man who never cared about me,
[710.40] reached your home
[718.48] and is now circling around you
because he wants to marry you.
[721.84] This wants to make me die
of embarrassment.
[726.72] My former husband,
[728.64] the father of my unborn child,
[730.36] who didn’t even think about
our baby when he divorced me.
[734.44] He is desperate to marry my sister
and is losing his mind over her.
[741.80] This situation is humiliating.
[747.08] How do you not feel ashamed?
[750.20] Why don't you die of shame?
[752.20] Stop it, Fiza. Just stop it.
[757.72] Don’t fight each other.
[759.68] Mother, let her speak.
[764.24] I want to hear how much
venom she has for me.
[770.36] I need to know
how much she hates me.
[773.68] Dua, the day you realize
[777.00] what my heart has gone
through because of you,
[780.60] that day you won’t
question me about it.
[791.12] Child, don’t worry. She….
[817.00] A man entered my house,
[818.48] played with my dignity
in front of my eyes,
[820.48] and he’s still alive,
[821.48] just because of you.
[823.32] You saved him.
[825.72] What you saw wasn’t the truth.
[828.48] I understand perfectly now
what is true and what is false.
[831.60] You want me to leave you,
[834.20] and for you to go to him.
That’s your and his plan, right?
[840.20] I will not let this happen
while I am alive.
[843.64] You will stay in this house.
[845.08] I will not leave you until my last breath.
[847.84] But now,
[849.48] I won't even look at your face again.
[854.72] If you can do so much,
[856.88] why can't I say anything?
[859.04] I am suffering because of your actions.
[862.24] You ruined my home.
[865.08] You took my husband away from me,
[866.96] and now I shouldn't accuse you?
[869.16] Despite all my efforts, all my love,
[871.80] the man who never cared about me,
[874.00] reached your home
[877.00] and is now circling around you
because he wants to marry you.
[879.84] This wants to make me die
of embarrassment.
[884.28] My former husband,
[886.12] the father of my unborn child,
[887.88] who didn’t even think about
our baby when he divorced me.
[891.96] He is desperate to marry my sister
and is losing his mind over her.
[896.92] I divorced your sister only
because you and I could be together.
[901.76] Now, I eagerly await the day
when your pride breaks.
[908.88] I will thoroughly enjoy it.
[910.04] How do you not feel ashamed?
[912.64] Why don't you die of shame?
[935.80] Madam?
[939.16] Oh God, Madam,
[940.96] Madam, what happened to you?
[942.56] Madam, wake up.
[944.08] Madam,
[945.28] Madam,
[947.92] Madam.
[957.04] I told you earlier to be careful
about her diet and health,
[961.12] but it seems you have been careless.
[972.32] If this continues,
[973.92] her life may be in danger.
[975.36] Why aren’t you taking care of her?
[983.84] There won't be any more negligence.
[991.88] Look, if you care about her life,
[994.72] take very good care of her.
[1009.12] Her condition isn't good.
[1011.00] I think she hasn't eaten
for several days.
[1019.52] Anyway,
[1020.16] I’ve started a drip,
[1025.28] and I’m prescribing some
new medicine for her.
[1029.40] Please give it to her on time
[1031.88] and take special care of her health.
[1038.96] Thank you.
[1040.00] Take care.
[1041.76] Let’s go.
[1132.04] Eat something.
[1136.92] I don't feel like it.
[1140.32] Perhaps you didn’t hear
what the doctor said.
[1143.80] If you want to bring
this child into the world,
[1145.52] you have to take care of yourself.
[1148.28] You don't care about me.
[1151.72] Why should I take care of myself?
[1154.20] Stop saying such nonsense
and eat your food.
[1162.28] Why don't you just leave us alone?
[1169.72] Why do you keep coming
into our bedroom?
[1174.68] I,
[1177.28] I’m only here to take care of you. Dua,
[1191.00] if it bothers you so much,
[1195.08] I’ll leave.
[1204.04] Okay.
[1214.52] What bothers you about
her standing here?
[1223.64] I want to talk to you in private.
[1226.96] Why does she keep
disturbing our privacy?
[1230.68] There isn’t any privacy
between us now.
[1241.64] How will I make you believe me?
[1245.16] I have given you so many clarifications,
[1248.48] I have said many things, but…
[1251.56] Sarfaraz is lying,
[1253.40] he is not telling the truth at all.
[1261.92] He wants to fill poison in your mind
[1264.84] so that you’ll leave me.
[1272.24] That’s the only way his
revenge will be complete.
[1274.12] Do you think I'm a fool?
[1280.84] No one can say such
a big thing so easily.
[1287.44] And if he is lying,
[1288.84] then why did he divorce Fiza?
[1290.40] Only to marry you.
[1311.68] Just tell me what I should do.
[1326.72] Whatever you ask, I will do it.
[1328.28] If you ask me to swear,
I will swear.
[1331.04] Please believe me.
[1333.00] There’s no need for that.
[1342.84] Just eat your food
and take your medicine.
[1345.16] I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of the doctor again.
[1349.36] Okay,
[1352.40] I’ll eat, but on one condition.
[1357.52] You have to stay here with me.
[1369.60] Don’t make such conditions
that I can't fulfill.
[1375.60] Fine, you don’t love me,
[1379.00] but at least you care about my life, right?
[1390.72] Can’t you do this much for me?
[1452.04] Now I’ll strike in a way, Dua,
[1454.28] that you won’t be able
to escape this time.
[1479.92] Oh, Madam, do you need anything?
[1482.28] No, I don't need anything.
[1483.60] I will cook for Ghaznavi.
[1486.00] But Madam, you’re not well.
[1488.88] And if Sir finds out,
he’ll be furious, Madam.
[1492.32] Nothing will happen.
[1493.40] Just give me all the ingredients,
[1495.76] and I’ll cook myself.
[1497.92] I’ll tell you what I’ll make,
[1500.56] you just give me the ingredients.
[1501.80] Alright
[1586.88] I made all this for you today.
[1591.56] How did you know that
tandoori chicken is my favorite?
[1595.32] It’s actually his favorite.
[1597.92] I made it for him.
[1599.28] Oh yes, how could I forget?
[1602.72] This is Nosherwan’s favorite.
[1608.08] Then let Nosherwan eat first,
and we will eat afterward.
[1611.96] Here, take it.
[1614.52] What happened?
[1616.36] When the doctor told you
not to do all this and to rest.
[1619.52] Why aren’t you following orders?
[1625.40] Don't embarrass me
in front of the doctor again.
[1627.48] No,
[1629.24] I just get bored sitting idle.
[1632.08] I made it for you.
If you eat, I’ll feel good.
[1649.56] Please pass me a fork.
[1653.16] Here you go.
[1665.52] Sit down. Why are you standing?
[1667.44] Sure.
[1679.76] Ghaznavi,
[1681.04] what's wrong with you?
[1683.44] Nosherwan,
[1684.44] Nosherwan, what’s wrong?
[1685.88] Water…
[1686.88] Water, water! Here,
have some water.
[1689.92] What is wrong?
[1692.84] Nosherwan!
[1695.60] What was in the food?
[1697.28] Did you poison it?
[1698.72] No, no, Ghaznavi!
[1701.92] What have you done? Tell the truth,
[1703.60] was there something in the food Dua?
[1705.44] Nosherwan!
[1706.96] Jaffar! Nosherwan are you okay?
[1709.20] Jaffar, come here quickly.
[1710.88] What happened to Sir?
[1711.52] Saeein ate the food,
but I have no idea what was in it.
[1714.32] Look at his condition!
[1715.68] I think there was poison in the food.
[1717.16] We need to take him to the hospital.
[1718.60] Don’t touch him.
[1719.52] Don’t touch him!
[1721.28] Isn't it enough that
you poisoned him?
[1723.00] No, no, I…
[1724.36] Nosherwan!
[1727.40] -Move aside.
-Khaliq! Habib! Zafar!
[1750.48] Where are you going?
[1751.92] You’re not going anywhere.
[1753.72] Murderers are not allowed to leave.
[1757.84] We will go with Saeein,
[1759.36] you will stay here.
[1793.64] What’s wrong, Kashmala?
Why are you crying?
[1795.44] Is everything okay?
[1797.44] Amma Saeein,
[1798.96] a catastrophe has struck us,
Amma Saeein.
[1806.04] Amma Saeein,
Dua has poisoned Nosherwan,
[1809.44] Amma Saeein.
[1813.00] Please come fast. Amma Saeein.
[1815.88] Oh God!
[1818.88] Hello,
[1820.04] what happened child,
is everything alright?
[1822.28] The doctors are saying
that his condition is critical,
[1825.12] Baba Saeein, all of you,
please come fast,
[1827.92] we’re in the hospital.
Please come fast, Baba Saeein.
[1832.64] Yes, child, we are leaving right away.
[1835.52] Don’t worry, child,
take care of yourself.
[1837.56] We are coming, we are coming.
[1851.36] Let’s go. Let’s go quickly.
[1902.60] Jaffar, Ghaznavi…
[1905.24] You should go from here
[1908.00] Just let me see him once.
[1911.24] Is he okay?
[1912.92] You should leave.
[1915.12] Once Sir regains full consciousness,
[1917.96] then we will speak with you.
[1922.56] For now, please go.
[1958.96] She poisoned Saeein
right in front of my eyes,
[1963.24] and I couldn’t do anything.
[1973.92] How could I have known that Dua….
[1976.64] that Dua put poison in Saeein’s food?
[1986.08] Amma Saeein, doctors…
[1989.56] the doctors are saying that
[1991.96] Saeein’s chances of survival are low.
[2002.04] Saeein,
[2004.52] if something happens to our Nosherwan,
[2006.28] I won’t be able to bear it.
[2008.40] Amma Saeein, please don’t cry.
[2015.32] Pray to God that
our Saeein gets well soon.
[2053.48] Jaffar,
[2055.72] throw this girl out of here!
