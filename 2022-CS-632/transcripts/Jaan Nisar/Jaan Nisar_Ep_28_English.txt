Hey, you are back. Yes, I had come. Did you come from your shopping? Yes. I didn’t feel like it at all. But since it was your order, so I had to go. You did good, after all, you would 
have gotten bored alone. I can wait for you. I know. What happened? Is everything okay? Hmm? You are hiding
 something from me. No, what will I hide from you? Why do you feel this way? I don’t know. But, I feel like you are caught in some worry. A man doesn’t forget 
his first love so easily. There is nothing like that. Show me what you shopped for. It is in the car, the driver must be bringing it. Hmmm. You are happy with me, right? I am really happy. This shopping, money, all this doesn’t matter. I just want your companionship, your time. All my time is for you. But, still, if you have a complaint, then come on, 
let’s go watch a movie. You are ready, right? Right now? Yes. No. No. You just came. You must be tired. What difference does it make? I will have a cup of tea,
 and I will be fresh. You are ready, right?
 I am coming. No, leave it. Some other time. Why some other time? You get ready, I am coming. Mama, have food. I am not hungry. You have not eaten 
anything all day long. Eat a little. My Dua was right 
in front of my eyes, I couldn’t even meet her. This thing has made 
me lose my appetite. Greetings, Papa. Greetings. What are you crying 
about early in the morning? What are you crying about? Mr. Aslam, I saw Dua. She was in a big car. I told you not to mention that 
wretched girl's name in this house. Can't your small
 mind understand this? How do I not take her name? How do I not take her name? One can be patient 
about the dead, but not with the ones living. For us, she died the day she crossed the doorstep. Mr. Aslam, I think she is in a difficulty. She had another car with her,
 which had gunmen in it. Yes, this is the fate of 
such wayward girls. Mr. Aslam, Dua is your biological daughter. How can your heart turn 
to stone towards her? Fehmida, my tone is harsh right now. The disgrace
 she smeared on my face, even if I kill her,
 it won't be enough. Mr. Aslam, I beg you. For God’s sake. For God’s sake, 
do something for Dua. You give the sake 
of God for the living. For the dead, there is a shroud 
of flowers, Fehmida. A shroud of flowers. Oh God. Oh God, have mercy. Who do I ask for help 
for my daughter? Mama, get a grip on yourself. Hello. Yes, send two to four to the room. Thank you. Hello. Your voice has already 
given up on you, Dua. After knowing the truth, the ground beneath 
your feet will slip away. What is the meaning of 
sending me these pictures? I have called to explain
 the meaning to you, Dua. I don’t want to hear
 anything from you. You will have to hear me. But before that, take the support 
of something heavy. What if you fall on your face
 after finding out the truth? Nosherwan has 
told me everything about the circumstances 
you got married to him. So, that’s why, there is no need to 
provoke me against him. Your Nosherwan told you under what circumstances
 he married me, but did your Nosherwan tell you, who Farah is? I told you, I won't be influenced 
by anything you say. No, no, don't listen to me, that's fine. But at least ask your Nosherwan who this Farah is after all. What did you think? Are you the first one who Nosherwan’s 
heart has liked? You have no idea that Nosherwan used to 
love Farah like crazy. And when Farah is 
no longer there, then, how can you always remain, huh? It would be better 
that you understand, that Nosherwan loves Farah more than you. And you know, a man doesn’t forget his 
first love so easily. You are hiding
 something from me. No, what will I hide from you? why do you feel this way? I don’t know. But, I feel like you are caught in some worry. There is nothing like that. It would be better 
that you understand, that Nosherwan loves Farah more than you. What happened? 
You are not ready. I will just get ready. Okay, then we will 
leave after having tea. Sure. If it is an important call, 
then answer it. Yes, excuse me. Hello. Hello. Ghaznavi, where are you? Why? What will be 
the answer to this why? I want to meet you. Sorry, I am busy right now. You will have to 
take out time for me. I really want to see you now. Are you getting… I cannot meet you right now. How… I wanted to meet you 
to congratulate you, but I am sorry to hear it. What can we do? They belonged to God, 
He took them back. Yes, you are right. Take care of sister-in-law, she must be really sad. Yes, so I am taking care of her. What else do I do? You still haven’t forgotten it? When does your sister-in-law,
 let me forget it? She starts praising her sister. How do I forget? If someday, someone 
finds out, then? It is difficult for 
anyone to find out. The father doesn’t let them 
take the name of the daughter, and here, 
I am also strict with Fiza. But, buddy, 
still, it is a blood relation. They will come face
 to face someday. Yes, so we will deal with it, then. Why are you boring me with this? Okay, Brother. 
I won't ask you. Tell me, how is your job going? The job is fine. You are not really satisfied. Yes, so how can 
I be satisfied, Brother? I work the entire month and I get a few thousand at
 the end of the month. You know, I want to become
 a millionaire, and I cannot do that with this job. Then think of something else. That’s what I am thinking. I am trying to get the number 
of the boss’ wife somehow. Then you'll see, I'll turn this job from 
thousands to millions. Meaning? Drink tea, then I will explain
 this shortcut to you. Drink it. Why do I feel that you are not with me,
 even after being with me? Why do you feel this way? I felt it, so I said it. No, there is nothing like that. Then what is the matter? It is your imagination
 and nothing else. This has never 
happened before today, that you are with me, but you are lost somewhere else. There is nothing like 
that even today. It is possible that I may have 
zoned out for a little while. Why even for a little while? This means you want me
 to always think about you. Do I want something wrong? Not at all. Then? Then this, that all
 my attention is towards you. You won’t ever change, right? Do I seem like someone 
who would change to you? I don’t know, but now I have
 started to be afraid. When I am with you, then what are you afraid of? Please, have it. Are you happy now? I canceled all 
my engagements today, and I am with you all day. I am very happy. I am planning to go to Europe. I find one engagement
 or another here. Will you come with me? With you? Anywhere. I know you and your heart as well. What happened? Huh? Check. It may be an important call. Hello. Hello. Ghaznavi, where are you? I am really unwell. Can you please come to my home? No. Ghaznavi, I have no one
 who is my own here. That’s why I am requesting you. Please. Please try to understand. I am busy. If my condition stays
 like this for long, I won’t be able to survive. If not for me, then come
 for the sake of humanity. I am sending you the location pin. If I die before you come, then I forgive you for my murder. You will have to come. If I die before you come, then I forgive you for my murder. Something important has come up. I will have to go. But you had said that you are with me all day, today. I will come back soon. Listen. I will wait. Look, I know you have been really 
hurt because of me and I am also regretting it a lot. But Fiza, don’t worry. I am with you. God will give us another child, and this time, I promise, I will care for you a lot. Did you want me 
to do something? You are asking me if 
I wanted something as if the entire household 
rests on your shoulders. You don’t bother to
 step out of the room. The household chores 
mean nothing to you. You should put
 in some effort too. You’re always
 resting on the bed. How long will Sumbul and
 I manage the household chores? Do you have any
 responsibilities or not? You tell me, what needs to be done? If you step out of the bed, 
then I will tell you. I had a little weakness, that’s why I… Hey, are you a special girl? Thousands of girls in
 the world go through all this, so do they get bedridden like this? And if the doctor just 
asks the girls to do bed rest, that’s it, they attach themselves to the bed. These doctors themselves are lazy, like you. But that’s it. it is enough. Sumbul and
 I have worked enough. This won’t work anymore. Go show this pride and 
tantrums to your parents. Don’t show them in my house. Understand? Now, enough… come on. Come on, do the household chores. Get up. I thought you wouldn’t come. You referred to humanity 
and made me helpless. Are you reminding me that you don’t love me? How long have you 
been in this condition? Since, yesterday. Did you go to a doctor? I will call them. No, there is no need to call them. I have the medication. If you have the medication, then why are you not taking it? I don’t feel like it. I don’t want to live. After Mama and
 Papa’s departure, I have become completely alone. Hmmm. Where is it? It is kept there. My heart doesn’t feel 
like having medicine. When has anyone benefited 
from listening to their heart, that you will? Here you go. I don’t want to have it. Farah, what is this 
childish behavior? Why are you being stubborn? Come on. Even today, 
when I don’t listen to you, you react just like before. Here you go. Come on. If you even give poison with 
your hands with so much love, they will also take it. Since when did you
 become a heart patient? Since I got separated from you. I think you should rest. I will go now. Ghaznavi. Marry me. Please. Please, try to understand. I cannot live without you. Please, try to understand. You know how much I love you. Please. Please, say something. Please, marry me. Are you happy now? I canceled all my engagements today, and I am with you all day. I am planning to go to Europe. Will you come with me? With you? Anywhere. I know you and your heart as well. Something important has come up. I will have to go. But you had said that you are with me all day, today. I will come back soon. A man doesn’t forget
 his first love so easily. Yes? Hey, your voice has completely given up 
on you trying to understand your status. You’re not even capable 
of saying anything, are you? Why have you called? Check Nosherwan’s
 current location. He is at Farah’s flat right now. And if you don’t 
believe me, then call Nosherwan and 
ask him where he is. Why would I do this when your spies 
are there to do it? But, I am surprised, where were your spies when Ghaznavi
 was getting married to me? I didn’t have an idea at that time, that Nosherwan would do this. Or else, I would have done what 
I am doing today, at that time and you wouldn’t have been 
standing on equal footing with me as a co-wife. Can I ask you what you 
will get now doing all this? You can surely ask me. The way you are ruling 
over Nosherwan’s heart, I’ll kick you out of there. It will give me peace. A lot of peace. Okay, for a moment, let’s assume that after Farah comes, Ghaznavi will leave me. But have you
 ever thought that even after that, there will be no place for
 you in Ghaznavi’s heart? Hey come on, thousands like you and Farah come and go. I am there forever. And don’t forget that I am talking to you sitting at 
the mansion of Nosherwan’s parents. What importance 
does that mansion hold, where you have nothing 
else but loneliness? It is really late now. Time has stopped right 
where we both parted ways. There’s no benefit 
in all this, please. You look at the benefit or loss. I just love you. Dua must be waiting 
for me, I will go. And me? What about me? What about my wait? Is this how you are
 repaying me for my wait? You had changed
 your path, not me. Had you not left me 
and gone at that time, then you wouldn’t have been 
complaining in front of me like this. I made a mistake. You can punish
 me however you want, but don’t look away from me. Punishment? You had punished me, with loneliness and solitude. You didn’t think about me,
 even for a moment, how I came to you to escape 
the blackmailing of my own family, and you just left me like that. You didn’t even look back to see what I was going through. Do you have any idea how I endured that phase? Let’s get married. We will live happily. After Mama and Papa’s departure, I have become completely alone. Please. Please forgive me. I beg you. Please. Please, forgive me. I forgave you. You just forgive me now. I am married. Please don’t contact me now. Ghaznavi. Ghaznavi, I will contact you. Not once. I will contact you again and again. And I will also see how long 
you stay away from me. Ghaznavi!
