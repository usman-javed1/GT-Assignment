[23.88] I didn’t know you people were coming.
[26.60] And he didn’t tell me anything either.
[28.92] Surprises are not discussed.
[31.64] When Nosherwan called
us to tell us about you,
[36.80] he sent the car as well.
[39.16] Then we couldn’t stop ourselves.
[41.76] How are you now?
[44.36] Thanks to The Almighty,
[45.44] I am much better. But
[46.88] you people bothered for no reason.
[48.40] Hey, what bothered?
[50.44] We got worried when we heard
about your well-being.
[52.72] That is why we came.
[58.48] Come on, let’s have breakfast
and do the remaining talks there.
[61.48] Please, come.
[62.16] Hey, we already had breakfast.
[64.24] We just came when we heard about it.
[66.20] We had breakfast, right?
[68.08] Yes.
[69.92] Look, if you won’t have breakfast with us,
[71.96] she won’t eat properly too.
[74.12] Please, come.
[75.36] Your house looks exactly like a palace.
[77.56] Hmm
[78.76] Have breakfast,
[80.16] then I will show you around.
[81.24] Really?
[82.00] Yes.
[84.72] Come on
[86.96] Here you go. Your favourite.
[89.72] Please have something.
[91.60] Dua, ask them. Maybe then
they will take something.
[94.32] Let me serve myself.
[95.32] No, child.
[97.20] Eat your breakfast,
[98.60] you are unwell.
[100.08] We will take ourselves.
[101.56] Do you know,
[103.28] Ghaznavi?
[103.80] I used to bother my mother
more than anyone else.
[106.72] I used to tease her over
every meal all the time.
[116.40] But my mother
[117.64] always used to take great care of me.
[125.84] She never complained.
[127.92] A mother is never bothered, child.
[136.52] I am happy that God has blessed you
with more than you used to wish for.
[146.04] Undoubtedly,
[148.32] God has blessed me more
than I wished for.
[156.04] You could have brought Fiza too.
[165.64] I am sorry,
[166.08] I didn’t have Fiza or her husband’s number.
[168.64] Otherwise,
[169.36] I would have directly invited her.
[174.16] Dua would have liked it even
more if Fiza had come too.
[183.12] If you don’t mind,
[184.04] give me Fiza or her husband’s number
[186.04] so that we don’t have any trouble next time.
[188.12] I will invite her directly.
[211.56] I am sorry. 
Did I say something wrong?
[215.64] No, no, son.
[217.76] You didn’t say anything wrong.
[220.04] Actually, her in-laws don’t like it much.
[227.40] What do they not like?
[228.96] Actually, the day Dua left,
it was Fiza’s wedding.
[239.80] We just tried to wed off our other daughter
to save ourselves from defamation.
[250.04] And Fiza’s in-laws got to
know about this thing.
[254.08] That is why they are bothering us.
[263.04] And his in-laws…
[265.12] I mean Fiza’s in-laws don’t treat
her right due to this.
[284.60] Why mention something that is gone?
[293.48] Dua is my wife now.
[296.92] Fiza’s in-laws should have
nothing to do with Dua’s past.
[304.52] The mistake Dua made,
[307.04] made us all suffer.
[317.20] But thankfully,
[320.52] Dua found you.
[330.04] My Fiza…
[333.40] My Fiza is being punished for
something she never did.
[344.80] Why don’t you talk to them?
[348.16] I mean why are you silent?
[353.60] If you say,
[355.08] I will talk to Fiza’s in-laws.
[356.96] I will ask them what is wrong?
[358.00] No, no, son.
[359.40] Don’t talk to them.
[360.32] We will talk to them ourselves
at the right moment.
[363.04] Yes.
[371.52] Actually, we have not told
them about you and Dua.
[383.36] They believe that maybe
we still haven’t found Dua.
[393.76] Hey, what are we talking about?
[396.88] We should be worried about Dua.
[398.72] She is unwell.
[404.92] Why do you bother the poor man?
[407.28] No, since you guys are here now,
[410.64] Dua will be fine.
[416.20] Yes.
[417.96] You bothered so much.
[437.32] Hey, now give us permission to go.
[439.24] No, Uncle. If you stayed, then
[440.80] we would have dinner together.
[442.00] No, no, man.
[443.52] You served us twice.
[445.84] That’s enough now
[447.04] You fed us really good food.
[448.92] We will go now, son.
[450.40] Dua now feels better as you people came.
[453.00] You will come again, right?
[456.00] May God keep you have happy
[457.96] and safe from evil eyes.
[460.32] Amen.
[461.40] Now, get well soon and
come to our house
[463.96] with brother Nosherwan.
[465.84] Now just consider her well.
[468.68] Okay, son. Shall we go now?
[471.40] Yes, sure.
[472.76] Jaffar?
[474.20] They shouldn’t face any trouble.
[476.16] Sure,
[477.40] don’t worry.
[479.32] Goodbye.
[481.24] Come, please come.
[522.72] Hey, greetings.
[524.00] Yes, yes.
[525.76] Greetings.
[528.80] Did you guys go somewhere?
[530.56] There was a relative who was so sick.
[533.36] We went to see him.
[540.96] Really?
[542.76] Who is this relative about
whom I don’t know?
[547.68] We have so many relatives.
[550.44] How many would you know?
[555.44] By the way, this is astonishing.
[556.56] You have got such a rich relative
[559.80] who has got such a car,
and I don’t know about him.
[566.88] Son, come inside.
[569.56] Let’s sit and talk.
[570.84] Come inside.
[571.44] No, I will go now.
[573.92] I just came to invite you.
[575.28] Sumbul is getting married.
[576.16] Hmm
[577.96] I will come in the evening to pick her up.
[580.00] She will give you the invitation.
[582.48] I will go now.
[583.20] Tea, have tea.
[585.76] No, I have some work.
[587.16] He is in such a hurry.
[588.84] Come,
[589.60] I will tell you.
[590.68] Sumbul is getting married.
[592.44] Okay, may God bless her.
[593.52] Okay, then.
[594.40] Bye.
[610.36] Come, child. Come, come on.
[613.56] Come on, my children.
[614.96] Come.
[615.64] Hey, now give her tea.
[621.72] Child, take this.
[623.12] Until Sarfaraz comes to pick me up,
[625.24] I am here.
[626.56] Actually, Sumbul is
getting married this Friday.
[629.60] I came here to invite you all for that.
[631.92] May God bless her.
[633.24] Come, child. She will
have tea before going.
[634.60] I will send it through the children.
[636.48] My daughter won’t just have tea.
[640.48] Father,
[643.00] if you would talk to me
with such love and affection,
[647.48] then I don’t need anything else.
[662.44] Child, you have come now..
[666.36] Okay, child, I am getting
late for evening prayers.
[668.88] Let me come back after
offering prayers, okay?
[670.44] Don’t go anywhere.
[675.88] Our father has changed a lot, right?
[680.52] Come, come in.
[690.00] Thanks to the Almighty.
[693.36] Mother?
[694.56] You all went to Dua’s place,
[696.48] is everything alright there?
[698.40] Thankfully, everything is fine.
[700.80] Dua fell a little sick,
[703.72] so Nosherwan called us all there.
[708.08] What happened to her?
[709.04] She met me yesterday,
and she was fine.
[711.52] She just had fever. She is fine now.
[713.28] Okay, thank God.
[714.80] Honestly speaking, child.
[717.04] Seeing Nosherwan’s love
and attention for Dua,
[721.04] I was satisfied.
[723.32] God has blessed
[725.44] her with such a nice husband
[727.68] and such a nice house.
[731.08] Sister’s house is so beautiful.
[733.44] I was awestruck.
[737.12] And Sister showed me her house.
[740.40] And brother Nosherwan
was so hospitable.
[743.80] He was not even letting us leave.
[745.52] He was saying that
we should go after having dinner.
[748.24] Well, that’s good.
[750.60] Dua is happy in her house,
[752.72] this is what’s making us happy, right?
[754.48] yes.
[755.24] He was also asking about you.
[757.44] He was saying if
[758.60] he had Fiza or her
husband’s contact number,
[761.16] he would have invited them too.
[764.12] We ignored it considering
Sarfaraz’s temperament.
[769.56] Otherwise,
[770.00] Nosherwan was asking
for your number.
[773.04] No, you did right that you ignored it.
[776.60] Sarfaraz won’t understand it.
[779.40] I was scared myself.
I still haven’t told him about Dua.
[785.88] I don’t understand what is
wrong with brother Sarfaraz?
[789.12] Why is he so arrogant?
[795.80] He is nothing as compared
to brother Nosherwan.
[803.00] Still,
[803.80] you have met brother Nosherwan, right?
[805.48] He is so nice.
[807.72] And then there is brother Sarfaraz.
[810.20] I swear I don’t feel related to him ever.
[818.16] It feels like we are his servants,
and he is our master.
[821.44] Sania?
[822.72] You speak nonsense.
[824.92] Go,
[826.32] make tea for your sister.
[828.08] Don’t scold her now.
[829.36] Sorry Sister.
[830.56] You didn’t say anything wrong.
Why are you saying sorry?
[834.60] She is a child.
[836.64] Hmm..
[837.00] She just said that uselessly.
[867.88] Dua?
[871.04] Why did you bother?
[872.88] I would have taken it myself.
[875.04] There should be some
change sometimes.
[877.76] Really?
[880.60] Are you fine now?
[883.88] You have done a lot for me.
[886.24] How can I not get well?
[889.64] By the way, you scared me.
[893.96] You get scared too?
[897.64] Yes.
[905.72] I fear losing you.
[920.60] Won’t you tell me
why you were worried?
[931.44] Did Fiza say something?
[936.36] No.
[950.72] Look, if Fiza’s in-laws don’t want to meet us,
[955.48] then why did they become so important
[957.24] that you are taking stress for them?
[965.80] You don’t need to take stress for anyone.
[978.12] You are Nosherwan’s life.
[982.08] Even if someone points out his finger at you,
[985.76] I will cut his hand away.
[1006.04] You are my God’s gift to me.
[1013.24] Sometimes,
[1017.32] I don’t understand how to thank the Lord.
[1028.64] I wanted to fill my life with sand,
[1034.64] but my Lord was supposed to
fill my life with treasures.
[1045.16] I found you,
[1048.00] and my life is filled with treasures.
[1058.08] When you and
[1061.56] father were talking about my sin,
[1069.00] I felt like sinking down with shame.
[1076.08] I made a mistake.
[1081.36] I made a huge mistake.
[1112.68] Cry some..
[1116.12] You will be at peace.
[1183.60] Tea.
[1187.04] I am hungry, bring me food.
[1191.20] My parents asked you.
[1193.08] You could have stayed and eaten there
[1194.76] but you left from outside.
[1198.24] Will I eat food at your home?
[1203.56] It is forbidden for me to even
drink water from your house.
[1205.64] Do you understand?
[1214.24] Let me bring something for you to eat.
[1216.04] Wait.
[1219.84] Yes?
[1224.08] Such a big car dropped your family.
[1233.92] What is going on?
[1237.88] Nothing.
[1242.24] You have such rich relatives,
[1243.92] and I don’t know them. Hmm?
[1247.20] They are distant relatives,
[1249.24] from father's side.
[1254.08] We don’t see them often.
[1255.68] No, no, no.
[1258.08] There is something else.
[1260.40] That is it.
[1261.72] The day I will get to know the reality,
[1265.36] you will not be treated right that day.
[1266.92] You will see what I will do with you.
[1275.48] What are you looking at? Go.
[1279.20] Sure.
[1301.80] Who is this party?
[1303.44] I should investigate.
[1312.52] Hey, you seem so happy today.
[1315.12] You are getting your first salary.
[1316.72] Yes.
[1317.56] Then you will give us treat, right?
[1318.64] Sure.
[1321.32] Yes, your salary is ready.
[1325.48] Here is your salary.
[1333.36] This is your cheque.
[1336.12] Sign on it.
[1338.72] Didn’t you deduct some extra money?
[1343.80] You took off days, so your
salary will surely be deducted.
[1346.08] No, that I know.
[1348.08] I only took two to three days off.
[1349.16] You deducted this much money.
[1350.84] Not two to three days,
[1352.76] you took five off days.
[1355.40] Okay, I took five days off but
do some amendments.
[1358.84] Look, I have done as much as I could.
[1361.28] Anything more is not possible.
[1362.40] What do you mean it is not possible?
[1366.00] Make it possible.
[1367.96] What ill-behaviour is this?
[1369.16] What is happening there?
[1376.64] What is the issue?
[1377.72] Sir,
[1378.52] his salary was deducted
due to his leaves,
[1379.72] that is why he is making noise.
[1387.88] Pay him the whole month’s
salary and fire him.
[1395.16] Sure sir.
[1401.64] Sir, have a seat. I will see.
[1406.20] Sir,
[1409.20] I accept I have taken leaves,
[1412.56] but I deserve this job. Please.
[1415.60] Please give me another chance.
[1432.20] Bring his file to my room.
[1434.04] Sure, sir.
[1437.32] Come inside.
[1456.44] First month and five leaves?
[1458.60] Yes, sir.
[1461.16] There were some emergencies at home.
[1470.64] Your CV shows that
you are a needy person.
[1473.80] Even after being needy,
[1475.36] you are showing such irresponsibility.
[1477.68] Sir, there were some personal issues.
[1481.96] Mister, we all have personal issues.
[1484.52] But before coming to the office,
[1485.92] we drop those personal issues outside.
[1488.84] Yes, yes. I will be more careful now.
[1494.72] Even your progress report
is not satisfactory.
[1497.44] Sir, actually, it was my first month.
[1500.96] I was learning and
understanding my tasks. But
[1503.24] you won’t face any
trouble from my side now.
[1511.68] Hmm.
[1512.92] Okay, we will give you another chance
[1514.24] but don’t do it next time.
[1516.08] Yes, sir.
[1516.56] Now go do your work.
[1518.96] One more thing,
[1521.16] along with personal issues,
[1522.44] keep your attitude outside the office.
[1570.20] My son is one in a million.
[1572.24] May God bless.
[1573.76] He is so nice.
[1575.84] Sumbul and Khizar
would look so good together.
[1579.48] Sumbul is your
daughter’s sister-in-law, right?
[1581.80] Yes.
[1583.04] What is her temperament?
[1585.80] She is so nice.
[1590.36] She treats my daughter like her sisters.
[1593.72] By the way, you have met her, right?
[1596.84] Yes.
[1598.04] There is a difference in meeting someone
and living with someone, aunt.
[1605.36] Hey, sister.
[1607.24] When the earning son falls in love
[1610.32] and asks for marriage, we cannot say no.
[1614.04] Now we don’t want to lose him.
[1624.80] Only my God knows
[1627.16] how I am burdened with two daughters
[1630.16] and am still here to wed off my son.
[1653.04] I will be right back.
[1704.12] Fiza?
[1705.80] Yes, mother?
[1710.40] Child, Khizar’s mother and
sisters are so weird.
[1715.80] They were asking
me such weird questions.
[1720.16] Actually, Khizar’s sisters
are older than him,
[1723.56] and he is getting married
before them so
[1725.76] it is obvious they must
be feeling a little something.
[1727.88] That is right,
but our Sumbul is so nice.
[1731.44] Will she be able to live with them?
[1734.32] Sumbul knows everything.
[1736.28] Khizar is also mature.
[1737.56] That is why he has put the condition that
[1740.16] once his sisters get married,
[1741.92] only then he will proceed with the reception.
[1744.92] Sumbul also understands.
[1746.92] And Khizar is also mature.
[1748.28] Well, I hope this happens.
[1750.28] It is about a daughter.
[1752.52] It’s scary as we don’t know
how people turn out to be.
[1756.32] You just pray.
[1757.36] Everything will be fine.
[1759.52] My daughter is looking so beautiful.
[1765.64] You are standing here talking,
[1766.92] and I asked to you see
if Sumbul is ready or not.
[1770.00] Hmm?
[1778.88] I was about to go.
[1783.68] Wait.
[1784.84] Come here.
[1788.52] Tell me one thing.
[1791.00] Are you getting married?
[1793.00] What?
[1794.36] No, actually…
[1796.68] If you are not getting married, then
[1799.92] why are you looking like this?
[1805.00] I swear, you are looking
so bad right now.
[1811.64] And go remove this lipstick.
[1815.80] Sure, let me go do that.
[1820.68] Hun..
[1998.84] Who asked you to talk to
Khizar so joyfully like that?
[2003.24] I didn’t talk to him.
[2005.48] So that means am I lying?
[2007.76] Yes?
[2008.44] What I saw was a lie?
[2011.76] I am speaking the truth.
[2013.00] I was doing chores all the time.
[2014.92] I saw you myself.
[2016.20] You were laughing and talking to him.
[2017.92] Are you denying me?
[2020.00] I just congratulated him
at the time of marriage
[2023.12] Okay,
[2024.36] so if you wouldn’t congratulate him,
he wouldn’t have gotten married?
[2028.72] Ask Sumbul,
[2029.84] I didn’t say another
word after congratulating them.
[2031.80] I don’t need anyone’s testification.
[2033.80] I have my own eyes.
[2036.20] This ominous face
that you keep in front of me,
[2039.72] as soon as another
man comes in front of you,
[2041.64] you start smiling.
[2046.52] And people feel like I torture you,
[2048.72] but the reality is that
[2049.96] women like you
are happy with other men.
[2054.64] You are doing injustice.
[2056.76] Khizar is like my brother.
[2058.12] Hey, stop it.
[2059.48] “Khizar is like my brothers” …
[2061.04] I understand everything.
[2064.76] I am not like this.
[2066.24] Don’t you realize that yet?
[2069.08] Listen to me.
[2071.96] No need to talk nonsense with me,
do you understand?
[2079.24] And just understand one thing,
[2080.12] if I found you closer to him,
[2084.28] I will shoot you.
