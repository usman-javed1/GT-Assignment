Hey, Fiza, where is the fried flatbread? Why is it taking so long? Does it take so long to make fried flatbread? And what is this? You are still not ready. Don’t you have to go to school? I am a little unwell. Yes. This is a good excuse to not go to school. Although, you know that the salary gets deducted
by not going to school. Fiza, child, if you were not well, then you should have asked Mama or Sumbul, they would have made breakfast. How could she? It's Sister-in-law's habit to play the victim and get others to praise her. How are you talking to your sister-in-law? Hmm? It seems like you only see
our ways and manners. But you are unable to see how Khizar taunts Sumbul
while praising her skills. He keeps taunting
her all the time that she has turned her
sister-in-law into a servant, saying she should do some
of the work herself too. I don’t understand how all this information reaches Khizar. Listen, neither is Khizar blind nor is he deaf. If she keeps on talking to him
on the phone all day long, then obviously, he can also judge that she doesn’t have time
to do anything else. He is an intelligent boy and on top of that,
he is also in the police. Before you say anything to anyone, why don’t you make
Sumbul understand? Teach her some skills too. You have put all the burden on Fiza. She goes to school and then takes care of the chores
after coming home as well. How is this justice? Look at her condition. Child, you have breakfast and then go to your room and rest. Sumbul will manage all
the work in the kitchen today. What life partner? You don’t realize my pain even a little. So? What did you decide? What do I have to decide? Don’t drive me mad coming
here again and again. Do you understand? You wanted to meet me, right? That’s why you also came to my home. So, I thought I would
come here to meet you. Do you not like it? Don’t test my patience. Do you understand? Or else if I do something
wrong with your sister, then you will regret it. Are you threatening me? No, I am not threatening you. I can also do what I am saying. After all, since I have found out
she is your sister, I have kept her on the toe of my shoe. If I divorce her, then your sister will not
be left with anything. Will you divorce her? Do it. Yes, I will divorce her. I will divorce her really soon. Do you think I will spare
your sister if you hurt mine? How did you think of this? You won’t do anything like that. You are mistaken or maybe you are challenging
my position in your stupidity. You cannot even think what Ghaznavi
will do to you and your family on my instructions. Hmm... And then, Sumbul. I will have to tell Sumbul’s in-laws
about your character. Then, she will get divorced. Then your sister will not
be left with anything. Look Dua, whatever it is, is between us. Don’t drag my sister into this. You will not do anything like this. Who will stop me? You? The meeting is after lunch, right? Yes. I am going home. You line up everything. Okay, sir. Send Jaffar inside. If you want your sister’s home to remain or the little respect you have left, remains, then fix your behaviour towards Fiza. If you hurt her even a little, then I will hurt you in such ways that you cannot even imagine. I am telling you this for the last time. I can even take your life for Fiza. Yes, sir? I have to go home for lunch. Home? But madam is at the office. She is at the office? Where is she? In Sarfaraz’s cabin. Can I come inside? Do you need permission? You will tell me this. What is the matter? Nowadays,
you come to the office daily. I was getting bored at home, so I came. If you have an objection,
then I will not come. Hey, when did I say that? Okay, you wait here, we will have
lunch from outside and come. There is no need for that. We will have lunch in the office. That is also right. Order lunch, we will have it here. There is no need for that either. I brought lunch from home. The driver will bring it soon. Sure. I will see. Hmm. Hmmm. Is everything alright? You are really taking care
of your husband’s diet. You have to, when the husband is like this. By the way, you can
also consider this my raid. You know, I hadn’t thought of it like this, that my missus can also doubt me. Then think now. After all, I have a lot of time. I have come with
a lot of time on my hands. This means, no work will be
done all day long today. Not at all. You comfortably work, and I will sit and look at you. Then this will be
the work I do all day long. What did you bring for lunch? The things you like. Earlier, I could have even forgiven
you for the sake of my sister. But, no. Now, I will make you pay for every
single suffering of my sister. You ruined my respect. You humiliated Fiza in
the name of being your wife. Really, her crime is really big, that she married a cheap man like you. You have played enough
with all our respects. Now your game is over. Now I will tell you what you call respect being ruined. May I come in, sir? Sarfaraz. Come. Please, have a seat. What will you have? Tea or coffee? No, sir. Thank you. Why, man? You are also my relative because
of our relationship through Fiza. Tell me, what will you have? No, I am fine. I wanted to talk to you
about something important. Yes, sure. Tell me, what is the issue? The issue is not with me. The issue is with Dua. The issue is with Dua, meaning? What do you want to say?
Say it clearly. Look, I think you only know
Dua as my sister-in-law, but… The thing is that she had run away
with some boy on the day of my wedding, and the police recovered her from a flat… How is all this related to you? I want to tell you that the girl you accepted being
so pure and decent, in reality, she has a really bad character… Stop your nonsense. Had you not been sitting here in front
of me as Dua’s brother-in-law, I would have cut your tongue. In the future, mention Dua after thinking hard. And remember, I only forgive once. Get lost. Why are you doing all this?
Ask a servant. Why should I ask a servant? I like doing your work. I get happiness. Okay, then you can be happy. When will you come back? it will take two to three days. If you are in the mood,
then come along. No, hearing your schedule
gave me a headache. You have such a busy schedule. I mean, what will I do there? I will get bored. Yes, that’s why I am not forcing you. First, I have two meetings in Lahore,
then in Islamabad, and if I get free early on the third day, then I will come back. Do come. After all, what will I do alone without you? Why alone? If you want, you can go
to your mother’s home. Yes, that’s a good idea. It has been a long time since
I stayed with her overnight. But you will forget me going there. Hmmm. Are you something
that can be forgotten, that I will forget you? You will see, I will make so many calls and
send you so many messages, that you will get worried
between meetings. Will you miss me? A little. Just a little? Yes. A lot more than a little. Because a little will not work for me. I too will miss you a lot. Thank you. Hey, since I have heard that you are coming over to stay,
I am elated. We will have a lot of fun like earlier, and this time we will also dance together. Uh-huh. I have stopped being stupid. Oh, why? You remember when you had bought
a radio from the scrap-seller and Papa broke it. Where is this sound of
music coming from? Oh God, this box of nuisance is in my home? How did it come in this home? Hey, why did you not stop her by slapping
her ten times and turning her face red? Mama, had told me not to. She scolded me a lot, as well.
She scolded me a lot. Hey, God damn it, music is being played in
the home of Akram’s son. I made a mistake. Sorry. Hey, you made a mistake. I remember everything. Mama, it would have been so good had
Sister also come over to stay. Really! Will you just sit here and talk? Go, and put water on the stove for tea. I will go. You send her again and again. She talks so much. Yes, she talks so much. Child, even I wanted that Fiza would have come to
stay here for a few days. She would have stayed. She would have rested. She needs to rest. Her in-laws don’t care for her at all. Why? What happened to Fiza? Mama, is she fine? Yes. Yes. She is fine. Thankfully, you will soon be an aunt
and I will be a grandmother. Her in-laws don’t care about her. I don’t know if she has told anyone or not. When I talked about coming along with her, she stopped me. She said she would talk to them herself. After that, she didn’t come here. May God make everything easy for her. Mama. Hmmm. By the way, I had an idea of this that as soon as Ghaznavi leaves this city, you will think of me. Ghaznavi and you? There is no comparison between you two. Don’t ever think about it. Yes, I got an idea about this. When I tried to tell him your reality, he humiliated me badly. He dragged me out of the room. Then you must have realized by now that your objective is not
going to be fulfilled here. Hmmm. Just think, Ghaznavi dragged you out
on just taking my name. If he finds out what your reality is, what will he do to you? So, you called me
here to threaten me? No, I just called to here tell you to
fix your behaviour towards Fiza. Give her the same love and
respect that a wife deserves. And if I don’t, then? Hmmm… then I will have to tell everyone,
everything, out of helplessness. Just think, if I tell everyone everything, then that will also reach
your sister’s in-laws, and then your father will not be left
capable of facing anyone. When the fire that you had escaped so easily from reaches your own home, how will you run from it? You will do all this? Yes. Fine, and Fiza? Did you not think about her? when she finds out that the boy her sister had an affair with,
is her husband? Hmm? How will she feel? By the way, between us,
those days were really good. But, when Fiza finds
out about this reality, then that poor thing will die of shock. Hey, that poor thing
doesn’t even know that you and I have come face to face. And I challenge you to ask her to introduce
you to her husband. Or tell your family to
come in front of my family and say that they
have accepted you. No one will do anything like this. You were weak yesterday and
you are even weak today. Don’t try to threaten me like this again. I am willing to forget everything for Fiza. I will not even utter your name. I will not harm you,
but you please keep Fiza happy. I will go now. But remember one thing, I am not your slave that I will do what you tell me to do. I will follow your path. Don’t threaten me in the future or else I will have to tell
everything to Fiza out of helplessness. Do you understand? You will have to do all this because Fiza is going to
be the mother of your child. Greetings. Greetings. How are you? I am good. How are you? Are you missing me? A lot. I too am missing you a lot. How are your meetings going? Yes, they were good. When will you come back? I am not sure, man. Either tomorrow or the day after. A delegation has to come,
but they still haven’t arrived. Everyone is waiting for them. Fine. But don’t forget to eat
getting busy with work. Don’t worry, everything is on time. Jaffar is with me. By the way, was he not enough alone that you have given
him special instructions? He has become a pain for me. It is good. If not me, then Jaffar. Someone should be
with you to take care of you. Yes, Madam, if not you,
then your bodyguard is there. I hope you are not getting bored. No, I am having a good time with everyone. Hmm You didn’t go out anywhere? No. And why did you send the guards
and the driver back? I had said they would stay there. Ghanznavi, this is a neighbourhood. People get worried,
and there is no place here either. The poor things stand out in the sun, I don’t like it. If there is a need, I will call them. That’s why I sent them. Hmmm. I have thought of a solution for this too. What? You take your entire family
and go out somewhere. I will ask the driver,
he will take you, people. Fine. If I have to go, I will call him. I am telling you, just go. Should I call the driver? Plan to go anywhere. Okay, fine. I will plan something. Okay. Okay, my next meeting is about to start. I will call you when I get free. Okay. Listen. Take care. You too. I love you.
