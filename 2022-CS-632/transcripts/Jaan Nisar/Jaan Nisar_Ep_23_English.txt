You didn’t come to
 the school today so I got worried for you
 and came here. You took an off,
 is everything okay? I just don’t feel like coming
 to the school now. Sania? You don’t feel like coming, what does that mean? Hmm? Mom, did Dad say something again? Why aren’t you saying something? What happened, Mom? What will Mom say? She is very worried herself. Worried, but why? The boy’s family is coming to
 see me in the evening. Dad wants to get me married 
as soon as possible. What? Your marriage? Mom, she is so young right now. Hey? What should I do, my child? I tried very hard to make 
your Dad understand, but he is not ready to listen. That’s a very cruel act, Mom. Our Sania is fond of studying, let her study right now. I, I will talk to him, I will make Dad understand, don’t worry, Sania. Okay, so now you have 
grown up so much that you will make your 
father understand? Yeah? Dad, Sania is very young right now, why do you want to 
get her married? I shouldn’t get her married and wait for her to run away? What should I do? Tell me. Dad, but my sisters aren’t like that. Explain this to your in-laws, not me. Wouldn’t it be better if you stop caring 
about people and think about your family? People keep on talking, Dad. I am watching it, the daughter who won’t even talk 
in front of me until yesterday, is barking in front
 of her father today. I have to speak up, Dad, no matter if it is about
 the people of this house or that house, they are both my family. No one is your family, this house is not yours now, you are married now, you must stay where 
you got married. We are here to take care 
of the matters of this house. Okay, I won’t come, but you cannot do
 this injustice with Sania, Dad. Who? Who will stop me? Yeah? Get out of this house and never come back again. What is wrong with you? How are you talking 
to your daughter? Hey, is this my daughter? She forgot all the respect
 of her father in two days. No, Dad, I haven't forgotten anything but I am just asking you to not marry Sania off right now, that’s unjust. I will do it. Hey, I am trying to get rid of 
you girls as soon as possible. If you want to get rid of us, then close the doors of this house 
on us like you did for Dua and get rid of us. Now, now, you will tell me what I have to do? You cannot do this injustice, this is wrong with Sania. Mrs. Fehmida, do you see this? This is how you have 
raised your daughters. She has been constantly
 barking in front of her father. Why are you 
blaming Mom, Dad? Are we not your daughters? No, you are not my
 daughter. Get out! Get out of here. Get out! What are you doing? Why are you pushing 
the poor girl? I have gotten you married, you just don’t have any 
right over this house now. You are dead to me. Dad is doing very 
wrong with Sania. Only what Dad wants will happen, you guys don’t speak in my favor, I cannot see you guys 
getting humiliated anymore. I shall leave now, Mom, you look after Sania, she is worried. Bye. I need the contact number of
 the woman Dua used to live with. Yes, right now. I kept on squirming for
 a glance and you, you became his choice? You have robbed my right, I will make your life miserable. Mom, I gave you such big news today and you are feeding 
me this grass? Feed me some Qorma 
or Nihari today. Sumbul has gone to college and your wife hasn’t even 
come back from school yet, so how will the stove light up and how will the
 food get cooked? Tell me. She will come, she will come, here she is. Where were you, queen? You do know that you have
 to cook the food, right? Hey, what happened to her? Why did she ignore me like this? I don’t know, I think she is out of her mind. I think she got the 
heat from outside. But why didn’t 
she respond to me? To hell with her. Look, we just have to 
celebrate today, because I have to join
 from tomorrow. I will definitely celebrate but first of all I will fix her mind! Why didn’t she give
 me a response? How did she ignore 
me and leave? No one is your family, this house is not yours now, you are married now, you must stay where
 you got married. We are here to take care 
of the matters of this house. Get out of this house and never come back again. What is wrong with you? How are you talking
 to your daughter? Hey, is this my daughter? She forgot all the respect 
of her father in two days. This is how you have raised 
your daughters. She has been constantly 
barking in front of her father. No, you are not my daughter. Get out! Get out of here. Get out! Who died? For whom you are creating 
misfortune in our house? No, I… you had some work from me? There was a lot of work, but Madam is showing 
so much attitude, and came inside without 
even listening to me. No, I was just, I was just taking 
this veil off and coming. Coming from where? You are mourning here. Is everything okay? Where did you go using 
school as an excuse? Who did you meet that 
you can’t stop crying? Mom, Mom is not well so I just thought of her 
and it made me cry. Hey? Everybody gets unwell but so much crying and whining 
because of your mother being unwell, it doesn’t make any sense, there is definitely something. No, there is nothing. There is something but if you want to hide it, it’s different. No, do you know, it’s not that, it’s just that Mom
 is not well and then the topic of Sania’s
 marriage was raised, when I thought of it, 
it made me cry. What? Another daughter’s marriage? Wow, wow, your parents are commendable. The first daughter ran 
away from the house, they imposed the second
 daughter on our head and now they are also 
concerned for their third daughter. Wow, they are extremely clever people. They know very well how to
 impose their headache on others. And by the way, when you marry your daughter, you are supposed to teach 
them some manners of living with the in-laws, now look at yourself, it’s almost sunset, and the food hasn’t
 been cooked yet, you came late from school and now you are sitting here and crying for you parents and family, do you want to make 
a home with your in-laws or not? Yes, yes, I, I am coming to do the work. You have to come within a minute, otherwise, you know Sarfaraz, he cannot resist hunger, so don’t say anything to me, control him yourself then, do you understand or not? By the way, my son
 is absolutely right when he says that God knows 
what family we got him into. My son had a lot of 
proposals, madam, understand? Come quickly. Hello? How are you, Miss Zunaira? I am absolutely fine. I am sorry I didn’t recognize you. You just recognize 
the bag full of money that I am about to give you. And that bag full of money, why would you give it to me? I will pay you the price of 
the work you will do for me. What work? To take Dua out of 
Nosherwan’s life. And why do you think 
I will do this for you? Money has a lot of power, 
Miss Zunaira. And by the way, I have heard that you are really fond of sleeping 
on a bed full of money. You have heard it right but I have taken a hefty amount from
 Mr. Ghaznavi to send Dua from here. So, so that’s even better. Dua is working for 
you as a bird of Gold, you should be happy to 
hear about my offer. What do you mean? I didn’t get it. You just do the task of taking out 
Dua from Nosherwan’s life, and I will pay you for it and then where will Dua go
 after getting out of here? She will come to you only, so then you get paid for her 
from whomever you want, however you want and 
wherever you want. Oh, I see. It looks like you got my point. Okay, so when should I send 
the bag full of money? Send it but, before that introduce yourself. That is not needed, you just be concerned 
about the money, there is a lot of time to be known. Okay. Send it. Okay. After all, what’s in that girl that everybody is ready to pay 
such a hefty amount for her? You will have to go back 
to the same dirt, Dua, that is your actual home. It was very pleasant meeting you, like they say, you should meet the girl’s mother 
before meeting the girl, so we chose Sania 
without even meeting her. Just show us a glimpse of her. She must be here anytime now. Umm, tell me what does
 your brother do? We have a very well-established 
business of shoes, we are honest people like you, we don’t make relationships
 based on lies. The situation of our business 
is not very good these days, Mumtaz’s first wife was very generous 
with spending money, she was very fond
 of spending money, she ran away with a man younger
 than herself just for the greed of money, leaving 2 children behind, But Sania will have to look
 after everything after marriage. What? Mumtaz is already married? Yes, brother Aslam knows the elder 
brother of Mumtaz, Asghar, very well. He also attended Mumtaz’s 
wedding a few years back, didn’t he tell you? Greetings. Are you Sania? What happened, Mom? Is everything okay? Go to my room and
 sit there quietly. And don’t come out. Go. Okay, fine. We have a lot of respect, 
I will tell you, but relatives sometimes say things… Mr. Aslam, listen to me I will be right back. What is this behavior? Who is the boy out of them? The one in the white 
Salwar Suit is the one. Ask them to get out 
of here right now. Hunh? I don’t want to marry 
my daughter to them. What are you saying? Ask them to leave. Hunh? You look very beautiful. Sometimes I don’t
 believe in my fate that you have become mine. What is the reason
 for not believing? When you went missing, I thought I won’t ever find you, but look, the fate made me find you. I guess I will gradually 
believe on my fate. So then believe it, I am yours. There is no doubt about that now. You didn’t tell me, where are we going? Yes, I thought you might be
 getting bored at home so let’s go out for
 dinner somewhere. Okay. No, if you have other
 plans then tell me, we will go there first. No, no, this is fine too. It’s enough. Okay, I am waiting
 for you outside. Hello? What is this scene that
 you have created? You made everyone leave. You didn’t even let me talk. It’s good that they left respectfully. What do you mean by all this? I have no complaints from them, but you, Mr Aslam, you are Sania’s biological father, you have brought such
 a mis-match for her. So, what’s the flaw in this one? He is just a bit old in
 age, what else? And who looks at the
 age of a man who earns? He is just old in age. I had an objection 
that he is old in age but that bastard is 
a father of children, he is married, he has children
 as old as my Sania, and it is not a big deal for you? What kind of a father are you? He doesn’t have a wife, and his children are sensible, our Sania doesn’t 
have to raise them. How are you 
defending this match? What do you see in it? A dumb woman like
 you will never understand. He is a businessman, he has a lot of money. Our Sania will live 
a luxurious life. I don’t want to get her
 married in such places. Don’t find and bring
 such proposals. Who are you to stop me? I am her father and I have decided to get 
Sania married as soon as possible. I won’t sacrifice my daughter
 for your blind decisions. It will be better if you don’t bring 
such proposals next time. You, you will stop me? Yes, I will stop you. You closed the doors of our
 home on one daughter, I won’t let you close the doors 
of fate on our other daughter. Look, Mrs Fehmida, you are crossing all the limits by 
going against my decision. I will cross the limits, I will cross the limits! What will you do? Tell me. You have already threatened 
me about divorce, you can divorce me if you want to but I will go to any limit for 
the happiness of my daughter, do you understand? I won’t let anything wrong
 happen to my daughter. Hello? How are you, Dua? Who is it? Hey, I never expected this from you that you would forget me so soon, and that too, me, Zunaira. I haven't forgotten you but I don’t even want
 to remember you. Why have you called me? Your style has changed. Anyway, why wouldn’t it change? It is not something ordinary
 to be Ghaznavi’s choice. How did you get my number? You have hurt me by asking 
such a small question. What do you think, can I be that unaware about you? Tell me if there is something
 important to say, otherwise, I am hanging up. We will comfortably talk 
tomorrow if you are in a rush. I don’t want to talk to
 you about anything, not today, not tomorrow, never! Why so rude, Dua? Did you forget it so soon, how I saved you from the goons
 the other dark night? How can I forget how you saved me 
from those wolves and tried pushing
 me in that marsh? But you didn’t succeed then. It looks like you aren’t out of the 
intoxication of Ghaznavi’s love yet, otherwise you 
wouldn’t be talking big, that too in front of me. Intoxication is the word for honor 
and love for people like you. Don’t ever call me again. I am hanging up. Do me a favor, I won’t bother you after that. What favor? Mr. Sarkar called, he was saying he wanted
 to meet that girl, he is adamant. You wounded him and made
 my life miserable. It is about his ego now. Are you in your senses? What are you saying? I am saying it for your own good. He has found out 
where you got married, imagine, if the word gets to Ghaznavi, what will happen then? What if he finds out what you did to Mr. Sarkar, he is a man, who will make him believe 
you are still a pure girl. I am afraid that you might fall out of his 
heart when he finds out. Stop your nonsense How dare you talk 
to me about this? Please, Dua, don’t be angry. Help me. You have taken more charity 
than you deserve, in my name. And it will be better now if you forget me and my name. How, Dua? At least think. Okay listen, I will also pay you. I spit on you and your forbidden money. Uh! She hung up. Anyway, that’s enough for today. Shall we leave if you are ready? What is it? What are you thinking? Nothing. I said, shall we leave? Let’s go. Your phone. Fiza, give sweets to your Dad. Fiza? Where is this girl lost? Yes, what were you saying? I am asking you to give
 sweets to your Dad, your husband got a job. Yes, yes, uncle, have it. Thank you, my child. I don’t know where is this girl lost. Her husband has got 
such a nice job, that’s such a happy thing but she doesn’t seem happy. No, no, I am very happy, in fact, I prayed a lot for his job. Hey, what prayers? I am the one who prayed. I have woken up for Tahajjud
 and prayed for him, that may God give 
a good job to my son, and look, God gave him a job, and she wanted to take all 
the credit for the prayers herself. Listen? We are grateful to God that 
everyone’s prayers got answered, it is time to offer
 thanking prayers now, hmm? And son, you must work hard too. Yes. Fiza, give me water. Okay. I will go get it. Umm, sister-in-law, you sit, I will bring it. Umm, no, no, you continue eating, I am done eating, so I will bring it. What happened? 
Sister-in-law? What happened, sister-in-law? Umm, I just got dizzy. My child, if you are not well, Sarfaraz will take you to the doctor. Where will you find
 the doctor at this time? There must be some doctor
 in the emergency, right? No, no, uncle, I guess my BP got low 
due to working in this heat, so I just got dizzy 
and nothing else. Sumbul, my child, take your sister-in-law to her room so she can rest for a while. Sister-in-law? She will rest for a while. She has been working in this heat, so she got unwell. Give her support and 
take her, my child. Look at the sensitive 
girls these days, they get dizzy when they work 
in the heat for some time. And then there were us, we used to stand in front 
of the stove all day but we never showed discomfort 
to either the in-laws or the husband. Why are you comparing 
yourself to a young girl? Hmm? Mister, you are joining from 
tomorrow then? Absolutely. Good, good. Shall I tell him about
 Zunaira’s call? No, he might not like it
 when he hears about it. If my dark past will come in front 
of him over and over again, it might even stay in his heart. What happened? Isn’t it good? No, no, it’s very good. So then eat. I don’t know what is going 
on in the house, I don’t know if the people 
came with the proposal or not, who should I ask? I don’t even have a phone. I mean, my success has started to bother 
you so much, yeah? You did this drama and took
 everyone’s attention to yourself. Why would I dislike your success? I don’t know, you would know it. There is nothing like that, I was just worried for Sania. Why? What did she do now? Dad is looking for a match 
to get Sania married. So that’s great. Before she does
 something wrong, it’s better to get her
 respectfully married. And if you are done
 mourning for your sister, do some work for me. Take out clothes for me 
to wear in the morning, take out my shoes, I have to go. Ask me if you find it difficult. Today is your first day. You will be an expert 
in a few days. No, thank you. You explained it really well. I have understood. Thank you. You are smart. You will grasp it soon. I hope so. Boss is here. What are you looking at? He has some personality. If we get so much money, we won’t look any less. You are right. Focus on your work. What if he finds out 
what you did to Mr. Sarkar, he is a man, who will make him believe you are still a pure girl. I don’t know what is 
the problem with you, I just came back from the office, Dad should have at least let
 me breathe for two minutes. He sent me here with you. I just got dizzy, I told Uncle that
 there is no need. Mrs. Sarfaraz, come in, it’s your turn, the doctor is calling you. Greetings. Greetings. You are calling me at the 
time of coming back home, don’t you have 
plans to come home? Yes, I have a meeting, I am heading there, so I will be a bit late. Oh, okay. Were you missing me? Yes. If it wasn’t an important work, I would have come. Do one thing, go shopping, I will ask the driver to take you. What will I do by going shopping? I already have so many things. Just hang out a bit, your mood will get better, you look a bit upset right now. No, I am not upset. I will go if you say. Okay, I will ask the driver, guards will also accompany you. Take care of yourself. Okay. Yes, Doctor, is everything fine? Everything is not fine, in fact, there is good
 news for you guys. Good news? Yes, a new guest is coming 
into your home. You have to take 
very good care of her, she is very weak. I am prescribing some medicines, start them very soon, in fact, start them from today only. Fiza, you have to take
 very good care of yourself. Okay. Doctor, this child shouldn’t be born.
