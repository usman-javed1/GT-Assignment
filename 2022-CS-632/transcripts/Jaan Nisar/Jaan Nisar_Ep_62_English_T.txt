[31.92] -Please, come in.
-Thank you.
[36.44] Greetings.
[38.40] Greetings, son.
[39.80] He has come to meet you.
[43.04] You should have called me
if you needed something.
[45.24] I called many times,
but you didn’t answer, son.
[50.36] Please sit.
[51.48] -Okay.
-You go.
[53.00] Yes, alright.
[56.52] Would you like tea or coffee?
[57.72] No, no son, no formalities,
there’s no need for any formalities.
[66.68] Yes, tell me.
[68.56] Son, I came to talk about the matters
going on between you and my daughter.
[82.08] What, what is the solution for this?
[87.60] Dua must have the solution for this.
[90.72] Haven’t you asked her?
[92.76] Son, if she had a solution,
[95.96] then why would I have come to you?
[100.32] What do you want, son?
Please tell me.
[103.60] I don’t want to talk about anything right now,
especially not about Dua.
[111.76] You are my elder and have come here.
I respect you a lot, but still,
[116.32] I don’t want to talk about Dua.
[120.16] Son, things will get very
messed up this way.
[127.08] Both of you should sit down
and try to resolve the issue.
[132.00] I don’t have any solution.
[137.40] And after everything that
my eyes have seen,
[141.16] I’ve barely stopped myself from
making any drastic decisions.
[145.96] There must be some solution.
[147.20] Son, maybe you’ve had
a misunderstanding.
[150.56] That’s why I’m asking you
to give me some time.
[155.60] I need a little time to think.
[158.64] Once I make a decision,
I’ll surely inform you.
[222.28] Nazia,
[223.92] bring some tea, child.
[241.64] Greetings.
[245.96] Is this the time for daughters-in-law
to wake up in decent homes?
[250.16] Mom,
[253.12] We weren’t able to wake up.
[258.20] so one of you could have woken us up
or knocked, it wasn’t a big deal.
[264.80] When you didn’t feel ashamed
in front of your young sisters,
[267.96] then how can we show shamelessness?
[276.16] Alright, tell me, have you all had breakfast?
[281.92] It’s 1 o’clock in the afternoon.
[283.44] The whole world must be done with lunch,
[285.52] and you're talking about breakfast.
[287.48] Alright, Sister, at least give us breakfast.
[291.52] Maha,
[293.16] go and give them breakfast.
[294.76] By the way, shouldn’t breakfast have come
from Sister-in-law Sumbul’s house?
[298.92] I’ve said it many times,
and I’m saying it one last time,
[305.88] I’ve strictly told Sumbul’s family
not to perform any useless rituals.
[314.24] And you’re younger so act like it.
[316.28] Don’t talk too much.
[318.84] Really?
[320.32] You did very well.
[323.04] You didn’t take the dowry,
you didn’t get the ring,
[326.40] and even canceled the breakfast.
[332.84] It seems like you’ve given
all the favors to your wife’s family.
[337.96] If you were going to act this way,
[340.00] what was the point of marrying
into a wealthy family?
[343.36] You should have taken us
to a shelter home,
[345.76] and I would’ve married you
to a poor orphan girl.
[351.76] At least, our hearts wouldn’t
have burned like this.
[354.48] -Mom...
-What, Mom?
[356.48] I’m speaking the truth.
[361.28] Sister, please, just give us breakfast.
[363.64] Alright, fine.
[366.72] You go.
[368.00] The breakfast will come to the room.
[370.24] Listen,
[371.92] be careful,
[373.52] everyone will have breakfast
together from tomorrow.
[376.24] Get up early.
[377.72] Yes, Mom.
[378.92] It got so late during the send-off,
[381.60] that’s why I couldn’t wake up.
[383.92] Well, miss, we were also with
you during the send-off.
[386.96] It got late for us too,
[389.56] but we still woke up at
the time of Dawn’s prayer,
[392.80] and this is the upbringing
I’ve given to my daughters as well.
[399.28] Yes, Mom,
[400.64] we’ll be careful from now on.
[402.12] The neighborhood women are
coming to see the bride,
[404.68] and they are leaving after making
remarks because the door is closed.
[407.80] And these are the actions of your bride?
[410.48] And in a house where
there are young sisters,
[412.64] the doors don't stay closed for a long time.
[415.24] There is a limit to being shameful.
[419.36] We used to wake up at
the time of Dawn prayer
[421.28] and immediately start serving
our mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law.
[423.92] Didn’t we get tired?
[439.64] Did you see her attitude?
[445.24] Mom, what’s wrong?
[447.64] Why are you getting so angry?
[450.08] It’s her first day,
cut her some slack. Come on.
[452.48] Why should I cut her some slack?
[454.24] Make it clear to her that she should
show this attitude to her own family.
[458.48] She shouldn’t be under any misconception.
[460.28] I won’t tolerate any of her tantrums.
[466.96] Mom, please stop now.
[470.16] I should stop?
[472.56] You better keep your mouth shut.
[474.80] You went behind our backs
and pulled this stunt.
[477.92] You have young sisters sitting at home,
[479.88] and you left to arrange your marriage.
[482.60] Do you know
[484.00] how badly this action of yours
will affect your sisters?
[488.96] Listen carefully,
[490.52] I won’t tolerate any such behavior.
[494.00] Did you hear me?
[519.52] Water.
[534.48] You went to see Ghaznavi.
[537.44] What happened?
[546.00] Fehmida, he wasn’t even
willing to listen to anything.
[549.64] What do you mean
he wasn’t willing to listen?
[556.56] So,
[558.08] how long will Dua stay at home?
[562.24] From his demeanor, it seemed like
[565.64] he has made a harsh decision.
[577.40] Fehmida,
[579.60] I don’t think he will take Dua back.
[584.12] What do you mean?
[586.24] Both of our daughters
are going to get divorced?
[588.76] Things are not looking good, Fehmida.
[592.24] My heart is sinking.
[597.80] Then you should have made him understand,
you should have talked to him.
[601.84] That’s why I sent you.
[604.16] Hey, I went because you asked me to.
[606.36] Okay, listen, if you aren’t able
to resolve things, take me to Ghaznavi.
[611.48] I’ll talk to him.
[615.24] I’ll ask him,
[618.08] how can he make such a decision.
[627.32] If there was any benefit in taking you,
I would have taken you.
[632.00] That’s why I went by myself.
[636.08] It would be better to wait a little.
[640.16] Let him make his decision.
[648.08] Let him think.
[650.40] When he makes the decision,
then we will see.
[652.84] Oh God, oh God, have mercy.
[658.36] What else is left to see?
[673.52] Don’t worry,
[675.08] God will make everything right.
[696.48] Man, is this the time to
visit your daughter's in-laws?
[700.08] Sister, we left on time,
[702.84] but there was so much traffic on the way.
[705.16] Yes, man, your car always
gets stuck in traffic,
[716.76] and your daughter doesn’t wake up
before 1 o’clock because she’s so tired.
[732.84] One thing is clear,
[734.88] being late is in your nature.
[745.40] Sister, what did my daughter even
do on the first day of her marriage?
[750.20] What did your daughter do?
[752.68] Your princess didn’t wake up before 1 o'clock.
[763.56] Is this the kind of upbringing
you’ve given her?
[766.12] Daughters-in-law from respectable
families don’t behave this way.
[781.12] Delays can happen with all
the excitement of the wedding, right?
[785.36] We’ve seen many families,
[788.32] and never have we seen or heard
of this kind of spectacle on the first day.
[795.40] Mom,
[796.76] Mom, you’ve made a mountain
out of a molehill.
[798.80] You stay quiet.
[800.44] It's men like you who spoil their wives
by giving them undue freedom,
[809.40] and then spend their lives regretting it.
[824.60] Yes, on behalf of Mom,
I apologize to all of you, please.
[828.60] Keep your apology to yourself.
[832.52] You wanted to humiliate us
after calling us to your house, right?
[834.48] Are you done?
[835.36] Brother, you could have stayed a little longer.
[839.12] Then what?
[840.96] What more do you want?
[842.24] If there’s any humiliation left, let me know.
[847.08] If so, we can have that done as well.
[848.96] Mom, are you coming, or should I leave?
[851.12] Son, please listen.
[852.52] What more is there to listen to?
[863.36] You’ve satisfied your desire to come 
to your daughter’s house
[865.52] and get humiliated here, right?
[866.40] Then let’s go.
[872.56] And this was your choice, right?
[875.12] Very nice.
[879.08] Let’s go, Mom. I’m leaving.
[880.84] Today, when you’re the one being humiliated,
your honor has suddenly awakened, hasn’t it?
[886.32] You’ve already ruined
that innocent girl’s life.
[896.60] Even during her pregnancy, you didn’t
stop putting mountains of grief on that girl.
[899.88] Shame, you felt no shame.
[909.64] Don't think of me as lowly, like you.
[911.80] Why are you all fighting
amongst yourselves?
[913.68] Enough, I’ve had enough!
[915.52] I’ve tolerated you enough!
[919.24] Do you think this is a joke?
[920.80] This, this was his true nature all along.
[922.40] This was his true nature behind
his façade of decency.
[926.64] This was his true nature.
[930.28] What kind of spectacle have
you all created in my home?
[936.12] Make your son understand,
and control yourself as well.
[939.32] I’ve tolerated you people enough!
[944.16] You are the rude one.
[946.20] And your daughter is rude like you as well.
[952.00] Don’t you dare!
[953.44] There's no need to say anything to my son.
[955.40] If you wanted to teach someone manners,
[956.60] you should’ve taught your sister,
taught your daughter.
[960.32] I’ve been saying from the beginning that
this marriage shouldn’t have happened.
[962.72] Now you’ve seen the result.
[963.84] Oh, Mom, it’s just his ego problem,
nothing else.
[965.64] He will keep speaking nonsense.
Come on, go from here.
[967.16] So, why would we tolerate this?
[968.36] No, Brother, please, Brother.
[969.92] -Let them go.
-Mom, let’s go!
[971.32] Brother, please.
[972.04] I suggest you take your sister
along with you as well.
[975.64] Do you see it now?
[977.12] I’ve been saying from the start
that this is not a good family.
[984.76] Go on and never listen to your mother.
[986.64] Did you see how they behave?
[988.24] They didn’t raise their daughter right.
[1000.20] What effect will this have on your sisters?
[1002.56] That’s why I was stopping you.
[1005.12] You’ve made a huge mistake.
[1034.92] This,
[1036.56] this is why I told you guys
to not get her married there.
[1042.00] But no,
[1042.84] at that time, it was as if your eyes
were blindfolded by the police uniform,
[1047.76] and you could only see his good qualities.
[1050.64] Are you satisfied now?
Suffer now.
[1053.68] His family completely humiliated us.
[1060.84] In my opinion, we are also
at fault in this whole matter.
[1067.84] How is this our fault?
[1069.64] You’re unbelievable.
[1072.08] Instead of supporting us,
instead of saying we’re right,
[1074.76] you’re siding with them
and calling us wrong.
[1081.44] I don’t know why,
[1083.28] but it feels like this is the beginning
of payback for actions.
[1096.60] After all,
[1098.44] isn’t this what we did with Fiza?
[1103.48] Oh, come on!
[1105.36] Now, where does the payback
for actions come into this?
[1111.32] And when did we humiliate Fiza’s family
for not bringing breakfast?
[1120.96] Their daughter and Fiza’s sister
ran away on the night of her wedding.
[1129.64] Who could have been
in their senses at that point?
[1131.40] Neither they nor we were in our senses.
[1133.84] Whenever I come to this house,
my head feels like it’s going to explode
[1139.00] because I keep hearing things like this.
[1141.24] It’s better if I don’t come here at all.
[1148.68] Hasn’t he started getting angrier?
[1174.04] Why did you call?
[1176.40] It was necessary.
[1177.56] I had told you not to call.
[1180.00] I will call you myself at the right time.
[1182.20] You’re not allowed to call like this.
[1185.84] I need money.
[1188.20] Right now?
[1189.56] You can’t get money right now.
[1191.68] Why can’t I get them?
I’ve been doing all the work,
[1194.24] but whenever I ask for money,
you avoid the topic.
[1200.60] I’m telling you, I need my money
tomorrow, all two million of it.
[1206.00] I can’t just pull out such
a large amount right now.
[1210.00] What do you mean?
Do you not have any money at all?
[1212.28] Look, I’m not an ATM,
[1214.56] nor do I walk around with
two million in my wallet.
[1217.24] I can’t arrange it right now.
[1220.76] Look, I don’t care
what your problem is or not.
[1224.80] I need the money tomorrow,
no matter what.
[1227.56] And if you don’t get it, then?
[1230.88] You need to understand something,
[1233.68] when a partnership turns into enmity,
[1238.12] it becomes very dangerous.
[1241.56] Are you threatening me?
[1244.64] You can take it however you like,
[1247.40] but I need the money tomorrow.
[1249.28] Understood?
[1297.08] It’s good you’ve come.
I knew you would come.
[1301.28] Here you go.
[1309.04] Is this two million?
[1310.56] What is this?
[1313.52] Two hundred thousand.
[1314.84] What do you mean two hundred thousand?
I asked for two million.
[1318.36] Be happy with this for now.
[1322.16] Why should I be happy?
[1324.24] You told me you’d give me
whatever I asked for,
[1329.28] and you expect me to be happy
after handing me such a small amount?
[1331.80] Do you think I’m a beggar?
[1332.96] Sarfaraz, the work isn’t finished yet.
[1339.48] Nosherwan hasn’t gotten
divorced from Dua yet.
[1343.40] Once that happens,
you’ll get your full payment.
[1349.68] Until then, consider this a blessing.
[1352.80] And don’t let this slip away either.
[1356.12] You have no idea what I can do to you.
[1358.88] Don’t push me like this, understood?
[1364.00] I’ll expose your true colors to everyone.
[1370.76] You won’t do anything like that.
[1374.68] You are taking me very lightly.
[1378.80] What did you call me?
An idiot, right?
[1380.88] That I didn’t record Dua.
Yes, I didn’t record her.
[1387.52] But I have recordings saved
of every word you’ve said.
[1395.76] And it won’t take me long
to bring it all out in the open.
[1398.20] If you don’t give me my money.
[1407.48] What do you think
[1409.36] that you’ll threaten me like this
and I’ll get scared?
[1413.60] You don’t know me.
[1416.76] To get where I am, I’ve removed
many people from my path.
[1426.68] I could destroy you so badly
[1428.96] that your own family wouldn’t recognize you,
[1434.76] but I don’t want to be angry.
[1440.12] I want us to work together
happily and peacefully.
[1444.76] What’s the need to ruin things?
[1448.16] But you keep making me angry
by bringing up money again and again.
[1453.32] Look, if we cooperate with each other.
[1456.68] You’ll get all your money.
Just work with me.
[1459.68] -You…
-Shabraiz!
[1483.28] I think you understand very well now,
[1487.44] or do I need to explain further?
[1496.96] Good job.
[1533.64] You were right.
[1536.08] Ghaznavi doesn’t trust me at all.
[1540.40] I’m completely alone now.
[1547.72] Even Mom, Sania, and Fiza
have all become my enemy.
[1553.16] I feel suffocated in this house.
[1556.80] You have no idea how much
I’m trying to get you back into my life,
[1564.44] and we,
[1565.44] we will spend a very good,
a very good life together.
[1568.40] You just have to trust me.
[1570.28] Yes,
[1571.96] I trust no one else but you now.
[1578.64] I’ll divorce Ghaznavi and marry you.
[1586.16] But, Sarfaraz,
[1589.76] you’ll need to be completely honest with me.
[1597.80] You won’t break my trust this time, right?
[1603.76] You know that after the game
that Kashmala has played,
[1608.08] Ghaznavi could become our enemy.
[1614.20] You understand that, don’t you?
[1616.32] Yes, yes.
[1617.60] All of this is happening
because of Kashmala.
[1623.88] She’s the one who made sure
the two of you were separated.
[1631.24] Look,
[1632.36] I have a lot of evidence against her.
[1634.72] So, she won’t be able to harm us.
[1646.32] As for Ghaznavi,
we’ll deal with him too.
[1651.20] Alright,
[1652.64] thank you.
[1654.00] Okay listen, I’ll talk to you later.
[1657.84] Alright.
[1659.32] Take care of yourself, okay?
[1678.52] My suspicions were right
[1682.00] Kashmala was the one
who set Sarfaraz against me.
[1688.36] Your pawn turned out
to be very weak, Kashmala.
[1691.64] He spilled everything in a fit of affection.
[1699.52] Now, I need to find a way
to get all that proof from him.
[1733.76] Sarfaraz has become too clever
for his own good.
[1738.32] I’ll have to deal with him,
[1741.52] but first,
[1743.36] I need to remove Dua from Nosherwan’s life.
[1747.96] I can deal with Sarfaraz later.
[1750.96] First, I have to take care of this.
[1773.32] I know you never loved me.
[1779.56] If you had,
[1781.92] you wouldn’t have left me in that hell.
[1788.76] So, what changed suddenly that
[1792.24] your love that never existed awakened
and you reached this point?
[1798.72] Dua, I did love you.
[1801.76] I just got scared.
I had nothing at the time.
[1806.56] There was pressure from my family,
[1807.72] and they had already arranged
my marriage to Fiza.
[1812.16] To protect my parent’s honor,
[1814.20] I had no choice
but to follow their orders.
[1819.28] But now you’re with me,
I don’t care about anything,
[1821.88] I have no worries.
[1828.72] Why would I be worried?
[1831.48] Because of you all of
Ghaznavi’s wealth will be mine.
[1840.24] But I only have a house.
[1844.76] How will all of this happen?
[1850.56] I want to have a lot with me
when I divorce Ghaznavi.
[1855.92] Yes, so don’t worry about that at all.
[1858.84] I just want you to support me
so that we won’t suffer any loss.
[1866.52] You know Kashmala, right?
[1868.20] I’ll get a large sum out of her.
[1870.52] Why will she give you anything?
[1876.64] She will.
[1881.20] Listen to this.
[1884.64] You want to remove Dua from the picture
[1887.72] because you want to win Ghaznavi over, right?
[1890.12] You also want this, right?
[1893.16] To get Dua,
[1895.48] and not just Dua
[1897.92] but all her wealth as well.
[1900.40] When benefits are the same it’s important
to have information about each other.
[1905.92] Tell me,
[1907.44] do you accept this deal?
[1908.68] What will the percentage be?
[1910.36] Everything that belongs to Dua will be yours.
[1929.00] Nosherwan still hasn’t understood
Dua’s cunningness.
[1933.36] The girl who tried to take his life
has played with his honor,
[1941.04] and he still can’t get her out of his heart.
[1949.36] He hasn’t even been able
to end his relationship with her.
[1956.44] This is what troubles us too,
[1961.08] what is really going on
in Nosherwan’s heart?
[1971.16] He seems to be suffocating.
[1975.28] Nosherwan will have to make a decision,
[1979.20] we will talk to him.
[1981.00] What will you say, Baba Saeein?
[1987.48] Even after treating him so badly,
Dua has still not left his heart,
[1996.32] and then there’s me,
[1998.88] who has devoted herself to him,
[2008.92] yet he has never given me
a place in his life,
[2016.04] not even a little place in his heart.
[2023.92] You don’t need to worry.
[2030.20] Dua may be in Nosherwan’s life,
[2037.52] but she has already left his heart.
[2046.84] Once someone leaves the heart,
[2049.36] they hold no significance in life.
[2059.24] He’s tired of her himself.
[2062.92] He will eventually give her divorce one day.
[2072.40] No one can deny your importance,
Kashmala.
[2079.28] You will certainly get your right.
[2081.56] Hmm.
