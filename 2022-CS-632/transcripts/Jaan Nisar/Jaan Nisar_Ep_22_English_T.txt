[23.23] We will not get anything other than 
loss from this relationship.
[28.67] Kashmala’s deprivations are pushing 
her towards seeking revenge from me.
[34.30] What revenge did 
that poor thing take?
[37.37] She is innocent.
[39.97] Why are you making
 allegations about her?
[54.20] Kashmala was the one who orchestrated 
the attack on me and my caravan.
[66.10] She conspired to kill my wife.
[71.70] Believe me, Baba Saeein,
[75.17] if anyone but her 
had committed this act,
[79.90] I would’ve gotten 
back at them by now.
[82.77] But my hands are once 
again tied because of whatever
[86.27] Kashmala’s relationship 
is with this mansion.
[89.77] It’s necessary for you to
 make arrangements for her
[94.47] elsewhere to get her out 
of this jealousy and envy.
[99.47] I haven’t just married Dua,
[103.17] I’ve also accepted the
 responsibility of protecting her,
[108.83] that’s why
[111.40] people who attack me
 need to understand that
[113.40] if they ever attack my wife again,
[115.70] I will consider it
 an attack on myself
[122.57] and then I will harshly deal with 
every one of those people
[128.27] no matter who they are.
[141.83] Baba Saeein, please think about 
my words with patience.
[149.43] I’ll get going.
[157.47] Goodbye.
[158.67] Goodbye.
[183.03] Mom, what do you want me 
to make for dinner, tell me.
[185.77] You, will you cook?
[188.80] Okay, I’ll come with you,
[190.23] help you cook.
[191.57] No,
[192.23] you’re not feeling well, 
you should rest.
[194.43] I’ll cook with your instructions.
[195.80] Yes, she’s right,
[197.33] why can’t she make it?
[198.63] Girls should know how to cook.
[201.63] She’s very young right now,
[204.03] she hasn’t even 
finished 10th grade yet.
[206.07] Hey, what are you saying?
[208.10] What chickens are 
hidden in exams,
[210.10] she should learn these things.
[211.80] Still
[212.67] What still,
[213.60] I’m telling you,
[214.70] you start learning from today,
[216.10] start teaching her from today.
[217.60] What’s the hurry?
[219.27] There’s a hurry,
[220.77] that’s why I’m telling you.
[222.50] Uh,
[224.07] I didn’t understand what you said.
[225.87] Child, go inside, go.
[230.53] Is there something special?
[232.47] Oh, what’s special about it,
[234.27] get ready tomorrow
[235.37] and have your daughter
 ready as well.
[237.37] Why,
[237.87] do we have to go somewhere?
[239.40] No,
[241.00] some people are coming over.
[242.47] People, which people?
[245.27] I don’t know that either,
[246.27] they’re brother
 Khurram’s acquaintances.
[248.17] Brother Khurram is 
one of your friends so
[251.13] why are his acquaintances 
coming over to our place?
[253.77] Hey man, I told him
[255.27] to tell us if he finds
 a good match.
[257.77] He’s one of his relatives,
[260.17] they’re coming to see Sania.
[261.77] To see Sania?
[262.67] Yes,
[263.20] don’t you understand anything?
[264.73] You’re saying something
 so unexpected so…
[267.47] What, what’s unexpected about it,
[269.57] do you want to marry
 your daughter or not,
[271.33] tell me that.
[272.30] I do, but
[274.60] the poor girl is very
 young right now.
[276.10] Hey, she’s not young at all.
[277.60] Speaking nonsense.
[279.03] I’ve decided,
[280.30] if it turns out to be a good match
[281.83] I will get her engaged and
 married immediately.
[284.07] Hey,
[284.70] how can we get her 
married just like that?
[287.70] Sania’s interested in
 pursuing her studies further,
[289.63] she has to give her 
matric papers right now
[291.27] and then she’ll get 
admission in a college.
[293.37] Hey, don’t let me hear 
college’s name.
[295.93] The deception my one daughter
 has given me after going to college
[299.23] after that you’re preparing
 the next one now?
[300.87] Mr. Aslam,
[302.20] Fiza graduated as well, right?
[305.27] And our girls aren’t like that,
[306.97] they aren’t like that at all.
[308.47] You didn’t even listen to Dua,
[310.93] you didn’t even let 
her explain her side.
[312.73] That’s it,
[314.17] I shouldn’t hear her name 
from your mouth again.
[316.67] That’s it, I’ve decided,
[318.13] don’t you even dare thinking about 
going against my decision.
[328.97] Let me talk to my wife.
[330.60] Sir, madam hasn’t left 
her room since you left.
[336.07] What do you mean, 
she hasn’t left her room?
[338.20] She hasn’t had lunch yet?
[339.43] No sir,
[340.03] we all tried a lot to get her to come
[342.77] but madam looked very angry
[345.30] and she scolded us and
 made us leave the room
[347.37] and told us not to bother her.
[350.87] And you couldn’t have called 
and told me this?
[353.13] Sir, I wanted to tell you but…
[356.07] Okay, leave it.
[356.97] If you want,
[358.33] I can give the phone to madam.
[360.43] No.
[365.23] Be quick child,
[367.83] what are you doing, be quick.
[369.30] Be quick, how much longer?
[370.73] Yes, it’s almost done,
[371.87] come, sit inside,
[373.40] it’s almost done,
[376.70] come.
[399.53] Sania,
[402.33] hey,
[406.27] don’t cry child, you’ll get sick.
[410.13] What else should I do Mom?
[417.20] What should I do?
[420.17] I don’t understand 
anything myself.
[424.57] Mom,
[426.10] Mom, make Dad understand that
[427.80] I don’t want to get 
married right now,
[428.90] you, you know that
 I want to continue studying.
[430.97] How will my dream of becoming 
a pilot in the Air Force come true Mom?
[435.53] I know,
[438.07] I will try, don’t make 
your heart small.
[440.83] Dad is very strict, Mom,
[442.53] he won’t listen to you.
[444.20] What else should I do then child?
[445.90] Just look at you crying 
and being upset.
[450.67] I…I’m telling you,
[452.03] I…I’ll die but I won’t
 get married, Mom.
[454.70] Shut up, don’t talk nonsense.
[457.70] I hope your enemies die.
[459.93] I told you, let me try once,
[464.10] sitting idle like this won’t rid
 us of the problem, child.
[468.70] Do whatever you want,
[470.20] but tell Dad that
 I won’t get married at all.
[473.77] What, huh?
[475.63] What did you say?
[476.73] huh
[477.63] What are you doing Mr. Aslam,
[478.80] will you raise your 
hand on your daughter?
[480.13] Yes, I will raise my hand,
[481.47] one daughter ran away
[482.97] and disgraced us in front
 of the whole world,
[484.47] the in-laws of the second 
one humiliate us daily,
[488.27] what should I do?
[489.47] Wait for this third one to run away?
[491.47] My daughter didn’t run away before
[493.00] and neither will she run away now.
[494.87] I know my upbringing very well.
[497.30] You might trust your daughters
[499.60] but I don’t.
[500.83] If you both make any
 scenes tomorrow,
[502.73] I will take your life.
[530.23] Sarfaraz, come for dinner.
[531.77] Go away from here.
[536.17] Everyone’s waiting 
for you at the table.
[539.07] So, what should I do,
[540.00] have I told anyone to wait for me?
[544.97] Why are you making a scene out
 of such a small matter?
[548.87] You and your family are the ones 
who’ve made a spectacle of me,
[553.00] you’ve ruined my life’s peace.
[555.40] Speak quietly, if someone hears,
[557.00] what will they think?
[558.27] Let them think,
[559.07] my family didn’t do good 
by picking you for me
[563.13] that I sit here quietly.
[566.77] My only fault is that
[569.07] I saw a chance and helplessly 
went to ask about my sister.
[573.30] Yes, so do you think 
this is just a small mistake,
[575.33] or if that isn’t a crime,
[576.67] even though I’ve told you
 multiple times not to do it,
[580.10] forget her,
[581.30] you have no relation with her,
[583.37] but you don’t understand that.
[588.10] You made such a big threat.
[590.13] I’m not giving you a threat,
[592.27] because whatever I say, I do it.
[597.37] Yes,
[598.57] I will take care from now.
[604.00] Okay, come outside.
[604.97] I’m coming,
[607.93] go away from here.
[637.63] I don’t want anything, go.
[645.30] Dua, it’s me.
[703.43] This much anger,
[708.17] that you don’t even want
 to look at my face?
[717.03] Are you upset?
[723.10] I’m sorry man.
[724.47] There was an emergency that’s why
[729.13] I left without telling you.
[734.10] What happened Dua?
[737.37] Who is Kashmala?
[750.40] Tell me.
[756.60] Who is Kashmala?
[764.20] Your silence is telling 
me very clearly that
[766.37] you’ve lied to me,
[773.50] you’ve betrayed me,
[780.50] why?
[786.30] Why did you do this?
[792.33] She’s your wife,
[795.80] you have kids,
[801.20] then,
[804.77] then why did you marry me?
[811.47] Such a big betrayal,
[814.80] why?
[827.27] I’d just started trusting,
[836.70] and you broke my trust as well.
[843.47] Do you know,
[846.30] I really think that
[848.77] Zunaira is right,
[852.03] no one considers girls like me 
the pride of their house.
[860.77] The respect you have given me
[862.73] is what I have requested for myself.
[870.83] What will you do,
[874.37] make yourself feel better then break me 
and throw me away like some toy?
[881.03] Why should I wait for that time,
[883.67] hm?
[885.60] I won’t do it,
[890.43] no,
[892.33] I’ll leave before that.
[897.37] If I wanted,
[899.93] I could’ve left the moment 
I found out the truth,
[907.30] but I waited to see
[917.40] and I see
[920.97] the silence on your face is
 very clearly telling me that
[930.67] Dua
[937.63] you’ve gotten betrayed once again,
[944.20] the world is very bad and I,
[952.00] I’m still very stupid,
[957.67] that’s why every time
[959.53] I become a puppet
 by everyone’s hands,
[964.33] every time.
[969.60] But no more,
[975.17] I didn’t marry you for your name,
 wealth, or reputation,
[991.10] I married you for respect,
[996.00] respect,
[999.37] and now look
[1005.57] I’m standing here dishonored.
[1012.63] I’ve fallen from my eyes again
 after seeing my worth.
[1021.60] I’ve become distant from everyone,
[1028.50] I’ll go far away from you as well.
[1037.47] I,
[1044.60] I want a divorce.
[1080.30] Did you hear what 
Nosherwan left saying?
[1084.07] Yes, I heard.
[1085.23] He’s put such a grave allegation
 on Kashmala for a new girl.
[1090.87] The allegation isn’t wrong Saeein.
[1094.07] What do you mean by that?
[1098.20] Everything Nosherwan 
has said is true.
[1101.57] I can’t accept that!
[1103.47] A simple and innocent 
girl like Kashmala
[1105.77] could never play 
a dangerous game like this.
[1108.37] Accept it, Saeein,
[1110.30] because it is the truth.
[1111.30] What do you mean it’s the truth,
[1113.27] did you know what the truth was?
[1115.50] Yes,
[1117.87] I heard Kashmala talking to
 the attackers with my own ears.
[1124.73] She was scolding him,
[1126.57] on how he could miss his target
[1129.63] and after that,
[1130.73] she confessed in front of me as well.
[1134.67] Now Kashmala doesn’t have any
 justification left that she denies it.
[1138.70] Such a big thing has happened
[1140.70] and you didn’t even tell me?
[1143.53] The matter was so big Saeein
[1146.67] that’s why I thought
 it would be better
[1148.60] to hide it from you and Nosherwan,
[1151.03] I wanted Kashmala to 
have some honour left.
[1154.90] But my silence had no benefit,
[1158.07] Nosherwan found out himself.
[1161.70] I still can’t believe that
[1163.73] Kashmala could do this.
[1168.67] The jealousy of the other wife isn’t
 just ordinary jealousy Saeein.
[1176.23] It is God’s grace that
[1178.47] they missed the target.
[1180.90] If something unfortunate 
had happened,
[1182.83] what would we have done?
[1184.07] It would’ve been good
 if that girl had just died.
[1186.17] Died Saeein?
[1188.63] We separated a live 
one from Nosherwan,
[1193.60] and you’re saying the 
second one should’ve died,
[1196.37] do you have any idea what 
would’ve happened afterward?
[1199.93] Nosherwan has just
 left with a threat,
[1205.83] he could’ve taken
 Kashmala’s life as well.
[1215.17] You’re right.
[1220.30] I don’t see the situation improving,
[1225.77] I, like Nosherwan, think that
[1229.57] we should think of something 
else for Kashmala.
[1235.47] What do you mean?
[1238.67] What should be done, what?
[1246.17] We buried Zawar,
[1253.20] we buried Nosherwan’s
 desires as well
[1259.00] but we couldn’t give
 Kashmala happiness,
[1263.40] Saeein, she’s young,
[1266.13] she has her whole life ahead of her.
[1269.27] What are you trying to say,
[1270.93] speak openly.
[1274.17] We got Kashmala married
 to Nosherwan so that
[1279.77] Zawar’s signs remain
 in front of our eyes
[1282.97] and they will remain,
[1285.03] the kids are growing up now,
[1289.07] and I think
[1289.80] we’ll have to make some tough decisions 
for the mansion’s survival.
[1296.77] The kids will stay with us but
[1300.10] you should find a good 
match for Kasmala,
[1306.37] we will get her married 
as our daughter.
[1308.53] Do you even know 
what you’re saying?
[1311.27] We should find a match for 
our daughter-in-law?
[1313.97] Why can’t we do it,
[1317.00] Saeein,
[1319.03] can’t you see,
[1322.63] if this fire spreads it will burn 
down the entire mansion?
[1332.33] Nosherwan has only made
 a threat right now,
[1336.87] we will have to think 
of something for Kashmala.
[1349.20] Maybe you’re right.
[1355.63] What did you say?
[1363.77] I want a divorce right 
now this instance.
[1366.63] You’ve become mine 
for the rest of your life,
[1374.40] I won’t let you go anywhere 
from my life now,
[1378.90] did you hear me?
[1389.40] I haven’t betrayed you.
[1391.60] Okay,
[1394.23] then say it,
[1396.07] say that Kashmala is lying,
[1400.93] she’s not your wife, say it.
[1406.70] You can’t say it,
[1411.80] because it is the truth.
[1419.40] I can’t spend my life 
with a deceptive person,
[1428.10] I won’t stay a moment 
longer in this house.
[1436.17] You’re not going anywhere.
[1445.77] After this betrayal,
[1448.80] you’ve lost every 
right to keep me here.
[1451.80] I haven’t betrayed you.
[1459.00] Yes, I accept that I hid the truth,
[1461.70] that’s it.
[1462.37] That’s it?
[1465.97] What did you think that
[1469.73] I would never find the truth out?
[1472.27] No,
[1475.40] I knew very well that
[1478.27] you’d find out the truth one day,
[1482.20] but I didn’t think everything
 would happen so quickly.
[1485.80] You,
[1489.83] you’re forcing me to be harsh now.
[1495.23] Be harsh,
[1498.07] what will you do?
[1499.97] Lock me in this house,
[1501.10] keep me here
[1502.70] or will you take my life?
[1506.07] What else can you do other than that?
[1512.63] You have such a bad opinion of me?
[1519.10] The person who has
 lost themselves in you,
[1526.33] what harm would he do to you?
[1531.83] Listen to me calmly once,
[1537.17] if you still think that 
I betrayed you afterward,
[1543.67] then you can leave,
[1548.47] I won’t stop you.
[1572.50] Baba Saeein,
[1574.80] Amma Saeein,
[1576.13] don’t give me such 
a big punishment,
[1579.17] don’t close the doors 
of this mansion on me.
[1585.27] I’m begging for your 
forgiveness Amma Saeein.
[1587.40] What are you doing Kashmala?
[1588.60] No, Amma Saeein,
[1589.53] I won’t get up from your feet
[1592.70] until you,
[1594.33] until you announce forgiveness 
of my punishment
[1597.33] Amma Saeein, I won’t get up.
[1599.80] Get up,
[1600.63] get up Kashmala,
[1601.77] get up.
[1603.47] What punishment?
[1605.00] We’re thinking for your benefit child,
[1606.77] we want to make 
a better decision for you,
[1609.67] for your happiness.
[1611.87] There’s no benefit for 
me outside of this mansion.
[1615.27] My well-being is within 
this mansion Amma Saeein,
[1617.90] it’s not outside of it.
[1619.03] We don’t have any other 
choice either Kashamala,
[1622.30] you,
[1623.27] you’ll always be 
a part of this mansion,
[1626.00] you’ll meet the kids,
[1627.60] you’ll come and go,
[1628.93] the kids will come 
to see you as well,
[1630.00] there will be no
 restrictions from our side.
[1632.17] We just want you to 
get married somewhere nice.
[1635.67] No, Amma Saeein,
[1638.73] no Baba Saeein,
[1641.00] don’t, don’t separate me from you.
[1645.37] If you’re scared that
[1647.33] I will cause harm to Dua 
again while living here,
[1650.40] I won’t do that at all,
[1652.20] I won’t even look at her.
[1655.10] Just don’t give me such 
a big punishment,
[1657.50] I won’t even make any 
complaints to anyone,
[1659.83] I won’t say anything to anyone.
[1661.23] Kashmala it’s not about Dua,
[1663.20] it’s about your life,
[1664.53] your happiness.
[1666.57] We,
[1668.10] we realize that
[1669.63] we did an injustice by getting 
you married to Nosherwan.
[1674.40] If we had married you to 
someone else at that time then
[1677.57] you would’ve been happy
[1678.50] and he would’ve been happy as well.
[1680.37] Now he has moved on in his life,
[1682.47] you also have
 a right to be happy, right?
[1687.20] I’m happy,
[1689.23] I’m happy,
[1691.13] I’m very happy.
[1694.10] I know
[1695.97] I didn’t get the happiness 
of having a husband
[1698.27] but you guys are here to 
take care of me, Amma Saeein.
[1701.93] You and Baba Saeein take
 such good care of me,
[1704.77] where will I go from here?
[1707.67] My kids’ future 
is in this mansion,
[1710.17] Amma Saeein, 
don’t separate me from you,
[1712.43] don’t kick me out of this mansion.
[1714.63] Don’t do this Kashmala.
[1716.53] Saeein?
[1718.10] No decision of ours will be
 taken without your permission,
[1723.60] but that doesn’t mean that
[1727.50] we will forgive what you did.
[1732.33] I know Baba Saeein,
[1736.10] I’m not even worthy 
of meeting your eyes,
[1740.37] I know that my mistake 
is very big but,
[1744.00] but Baba Saeein,
[1744.90] let me stay in this mansion,
[1746.77] my happiness lies here.
[1750.03] Please, Baba Saeein,
[1751.07] don’t kick me out of this mansion,
[1752.97] my happiness lies here,
[1754.57] Baba Saeein.
[1755.03] Okay, alright,
[1757.40] alright,
[1760.53] no one’s sending you anywhere,
[1761.77] come.
[1802.83] Make Dad understand that
[1803.97] I don’t want to get married right now,
[1805.17] you, you know that
[1806.13] I want to continue studying.
[1807.23] How will my dream of becoming
 a pilot in the Air Force come true, Mom?
[1946.73] What happened?
[1948.97] Nothing,
[1952.33] you looked so good 
while reciting that
[1955.73] I couldn’t stay back.
[1960.47] Thank you for not leaving me.
[1965.73] I didn’t do a favor
 on you by not leaving.
[1970.67] But yes, if you’d told me sooner
[1974.83] all this misunderstanding
 wouldn’t have even occurred.
[1978.00] I made a mistake man.
[1985.33] You don’t have anything left
 unsaid in your heart, right?
[1991.83] You’re the only one in this heart,
[1995.97] there’s no place for anything else.
[2006.50] I’ll make you breakfast.
[2007.97] Hey, no, you’ll do your recitation.
[2010.53] You can ask a maid.
[2015.70] Only servants have
 been making it for years,
[2019.37] now this duty is your wife’s,
[2022.07] let me make it.
[2026.37] This is my good fortune.
[2035.17] Do you want to meet your family?
[2045.27] Look, I found out that
[2047.50] your dad closed your
 house’s doors on you.
[2053.07] Relationships don’t end by
 closing the doors to the house.
[2057.87] I think you should meet him.
[2062.43] Relationships don’t end by 
closing the doors to the house,
[2068.93] relationships end by closing 
the doors to one’s hearts.
[2074.97] My family did the same to me.
[2081.07] If he wanted to meet,
[2084.60] he could’ve found me.
[2086.60] No, maybe he tried looking for you,
[2090.10] maybe he wanted to meet you
[2091.20] but he couldn’t find you.
[2092.70] I don’t want to meet him,
[2095.57] even if he wants to meet now so…
[2100.37] You’re getting emotional.
[2101.50] I was before,
[2104.40] not anymore.
[2112.10] I’ll bring you breakfast.
