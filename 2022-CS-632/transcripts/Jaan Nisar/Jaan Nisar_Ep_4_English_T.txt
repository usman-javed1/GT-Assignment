[26.13] This place of yours has 
so much peace and beauty.
[31.27] Whenever I come here,
[33.93] I find a lot of happiness.
[37.63] In fact, will you always keep me
happy like this?
[42.40] Don’t you believe me?
[44.70] More than myself.
[49.17] I am going to change this belief 
of yours into truth.
[54.50] I am going to talk to Baba Saeein,
 about our proposal.
[59.97] Really?
[62.60] Really.
[67.57] But, if he doesn’t agree, then?
[74.33] Still, no one can separate me from you.
[77.87] Promise?
[80.27] I promise.
[83.73] And you know how steadfast
I am in my promises.
[88.80] You didn’t fulfill your promise, 
Nosherwan.
[92.10] I hate you Nosherwan.
[112.50] Nosherwan, don’t I even have 
this much right
[116.13] that I can hold your hand?
[120.37] I have held your hand for a lifetime,
[124.03] what else do you want?
[127.67] What are you punishing me for?
[132.50] What is my fault?
[136.33] Maybe, I am the one 
who is getting punished.
[139.97] You just have to live with 
this truth all your life,
[144.63] that you and I have a 
relationship on paper.
[150.07] Till how long will you mourn, 
Nosherwan?
[157.17] Why don’t you accept the truth?
[161.63] Why don’t you understand
[163.47] that everything will get destroyed 
in this fire of distances?
[167.97] Destroyed?
[171.13] When was I ever prosperous?
[175.20] You don’t have the courage 
to hear the truth.
[178.90] Maybe this is why 
you still have hope.
[183.87] How long will the two of us 
continue to fight like this?
[188.63] Stay peacefully, 
and also let me live.
[192.93] Then you too hear one thing.
[195.53] Understand this well.
[199.30] I will continue to fight with you,
[202.97] till the time I have hope,
[205.43] until there is a chance that 
I will get love from you.
[211.60] And the day this hope ends,
Nosherwan,
[217.03] I will stop talking,
[221.20] I will go completely quiet.
[226.30] Nosherwan, I love you.
[232.67] But, I don’t love you.
[271.80] Hey Sumbul,
[273.63] hurry up, we are getting late.
[275.03] And bring some earrings, 
my ears are empty.
[278.07] Are you people going somewhere?
[280.10] To see our sister-in-law.
[281.77] To see a sister-in-law?
[283.37] Yes.
[284.53] The wedding planner mentioned 
a really good girl.
[287.47] I cannot resist, 
I am going to meet her.
[290.47] Hey, so suddenly? You should 
have told me at least.
[292.53] When is it sudden?
[293.57] I told you that I would start 
looking for girls for you.
[296.67] Now, by luck we have found a good girl,
[298.73] so why should I delay?
[301.27] You come on, we are getting late. 
Come on.
[335.77] Hi.
[337.77] You are upset because 
Faraz didn’t come?
[343.67] No.
[346.67] All the boys are the same.
[349.87] Look at Fahad,
[351.47] he is Faraz’s friend.
[354.40] He used to say to me,
[355.90] that if I don’t talk to you for a moment, 
then my time doesn’t pass.
[359.97] See now,
[361.37] ten hours have passed,
[363.20] but he didn’t send a single message.
[365.67] This Faraz is exactly the same.
[367.80] I don’t think so.
[370.20] Really?
[371.43] If you don’t think so, 
then where is he?
[373.17] Why has he not come till now?
[374.97] He had made my life hell 
calling me repeatedly.
[378.40] And see now,
[379.90] you have been sitting here 
waiting for so long,
[381.93] and we don’t know the whereabouts
of that mister.
[384.27] I am not waiting.
[386.63] Hey, enough. Leave it.
[388.40] I know it all.
[390.10] You were getting so happy when you
got free from the class, and see now,
[394.30] you have such a sad face.
[397.50] I have had enough, 
I am going home.
[400.60] And if you want, 
then come along,
[402.63] or else sit and wait for Faraz.
[407.10] Okay.
[409.07] Goodbye. 
Goodbye.
[459.50] Sir, the hunting equipment is 
being loaded into the car.
[462.40] Please prepare to depart.
[464.53] Yes, let me just change my clothes, 
then we will go.
[467.07] Okay. You change your clothes.
[468.57] Hmmm.
[474.90] Uncle, we too will go hunting with you.
[477.37] I never went hunting.
[479.30] It will be a lot of fun.
[481.20] But children don’t go hunting.
[483.40] Why don’t they go?
[484.73] Because there are wild animals 
when you go hunting,
[487.10] they can harm you.
[488.73] So, we are not going alone,
[490.40] mama too is coming along with us.
[492.73] Yes, what else?
[493.87] We will hunt and also have a picnic.
[496.83] The children are right.
[503.37] So, uncle, we are going, right?
[505.83] Should I go put on my fairy dress?
[508.03] And I will go dressed as Spiderman.
[510.13] No, children,
[512.97] uncle cannot take you hunting,
[516.10] but I promise, 
I will take you to playland.
[518.77] Next time.
[520.27] Promise?
Pinky promise.
[522.47] Yay.
[523.90] Thank you.
[535.17] Whatever you are doing using 
the children as a weapon is wrong.
[540.13] What is wrong, Nosherwan?
[544.00] I want to spend some time with you.
[547.07] What is wrong with that?
[555.43] Nosherwan,
[558.47] no matter how much you run from me,
[562.63] one day, you have to come back to me.
[569.80] That day will never come in my life.
[588.23] Child, work quickly.
[590.63] I am doing it, mama.
[591.90] You are worried yourself, 
and you are also worrying us.
[593.97] Hey, how can I not worry?
[595.63] Earlier, the boy’s family was 
coming in the evening,
[597.70] now Naseema sent me a message
that they will reach shortly.
[600.67] Now, if I don’t get worried in such 
a situation, then what do I do?
[602.97] Hey, you don’t worry.
[604.07] Everything will be done
by the time they come.
[605.63] Hey, Fiza,
[606.80] you are still roaming around 
in the same getup.
[609.83] Leave it, I will do it. 
You go.
[611.40] Go and take out a good dress
 of Dua’s and wear it.
[614.13] Get ready. This Dua…
[616.90] was it necessary for her 
to go to the university today?
[619.43] If she was at home, 
she would have dressed you up.
[621.67] This is the only good thing 
she knows how to do.
[624.07] Mama, you call that grooming.
[626.63] Okay. Okay, whatever you call it.
[628.27] Hey, how was the poor thing 
supposed to know
[629.83] that the boy’s family would change 
their plan suddenly?
[631.93] This is what I am tensed about.
[634.13] I just sent Guddu from the neighborhood
 to get baked food and nimco.
[638.07] I pray to God he comes soon.
[639.57] Did you mix the sugar?
[640.73] Yes, I have mixed it.
[642.03] Okay, go. Leave it. 
Give it to me. Go. Go.
[644.50] Get ready. 
I am going. I am going.
[690.17] You? Here?
[694.13] So, were you waiting 
for someone else?
[697.87] Why would I wait 
for someone else?
[699.90] Did you not get happy 
seeing me here?
[704.17] Why would I be happy?
[706.43] Really?
[708.97] By the way,
[711.33] the smile on your face is telling me 
that you are happy to see me here.
[717.37] There is nothing like that.
[718.37] You lie well,
[720.53] and you look equally good 
when you lie.
[724.60] Anyway, by the way, 
I know about one thing,
[727.20] if someone else would have come 
and stopped their car here like this,
[730.87] you would have scolded them badly.
[734.83] That is true.
[737.70] Okay, if you don’t mind,
[740.77] can we go and sit somewhere?
[741.83] No, it is really late.
[744.07] Hey, please. Please. For me.
[747.63] I will drop you back in a little while.
[752.37] Fine.
[753.57] Come on.
[756.13] Come on.
[775.47] Fehmida, my evening might 
suddenly get occupied,
[779.20] so I brought sister Kausar 
along in an emergency.
[783.27] And I thought, we are like family,
[785.63] you too will agree.
[786.87] And then, we shouldn’t delay 
the work of today, to tomorrow. Right?
[789.93] Yes, absolutely. You did well.
[791.77] Should I tell you the truth?
[793.67] I insisted a lot to Naseeban.
[797.10] She praised your daughter so much,
[799.47] that I couldn’t resist.
[801.13] If you didn’t like anything in my haste, 
then I apologize.
[805.03] Hey, no, not at all.
[806.83] What are you saying?
[808.30] You have the juice.
[810.20] Yes, yes, I will have that.
[811.90] But, call our daughter. 
We should also see her.
[816.60] Yes, why not?
[817.70] Go, bring Fiza.
[828.07] So, did you read the letter?
[830.97] Yes.
[832.30] And, then?
[835.40] Then, what?
[837.70] Then,
[840.37] how did you find it?
[844.00] or am I alone that 
I think like this, alone?
[846.47] I am here with you right now,
[849.90] and you still want to ask this?
[852.73] Yes, maybe
[855.67] I want to hear you express your love.
[859.17] I too want to know that
[861.73] do you too see my dreams 
with open eyes,
[867.30] the same way you have snatched 
the sleep of my night.
[878.03] You didn’t answer me.
[880.80] I don’t know.
[882.03] Okay.
[884.30] Okay, if you don’t know, then
[886.90] why did you not like it 
when I didn’t come to meet you?
[890.23] Actually, Rida and Fahad had a breakup,
[894.40] so I thought that…
What did you think?
[897.70] Hey, they broke up, not us.
[901.60] We have to feel each other’s love
right now.
[907.33] Do you always talk like this?
[909.37] No,
[911.67] before meeting you even I didn’t know
 that I could talk like this.
[918.33] But,
[920.27] that’s how it is.
[923.37] Anyway,
[925.70] shall we go somewhere for ice cream?
[928.50] Right now?
[930.63] It will get really late.
[932.63] I don’t want to get out of the car.
[934.63] Yes, so don’t get out of the car.
[936.37] We will sit and eat.
[939.10] Shall we go?
[941.43] Come on.
[947.43] I found her to be just as I had heard.
[950.67] Look.
[951.47] When Naseeban speaks, 
she speaks frankly.
[953.90] When she talks, 
she talks straight.
[956.43] Absolutely. 
There is no doubt about that.
[958.63] Sister, you just think that 
your daughter is now mine.
[962.80] You come and meet my son 
as soon as possible.
[965.77] Then we will fix the wedding date.
[971.53] But, so soon?
[973.97] Hey, Fehmida,
[976.23] our Fiza has a great destiny.
[979.47] See, the first relationship always 
comes from destined individuals.
[982.33] Rejecting the first relationship 
is like angering fate.
[986.33] Isn't that right?
[987.83] I will not hear a refusal, at all.
[991.17] That’s it.
[992.03] Your daughter has won my heart.
[994.73] That is fine, 
but I am not saying no.
[999.87] I will have to discuss 
this with Fiza’s father.
[1002.27] Yes, yes, surely discuss.
[1003.93] But just come and meet my son
in a day or two,
[1007.07] so that we can take 
the discussion forward.
[1008.93] Okay.
[1011.60] By the way, what do you do?
[1014.33] I stay busy with work at home 
and I teach in a school.
[1020.13] Mama, show her brother’s picture.
[1023.20] Hey, yes.
[1024.23] I gave you the picture,
 show it to me.
[1028.43] Yes, yes, I will just show it.
[1031.73] Here.
[1051.30] Have something, sister.
[1052.90] Yes. Yes.
[1075.87] Dua.
[1085.37] Thank you.
[1091.73] Shall we go?
[1093.57] We are getting late.
[1095.10] Yes, I will just drop you.
[1099.10] No, you don’t drop me.
[1102.70] If someone sees me, 
then it will be a big issue.
[1105.37] Do one thing, drop me at 
the university stop, I will go myself.
[1109.87] Okay, fine,
[1111.17] we will do as you say. Okay?
[1118.20] I brought this for you.
[1122.47] This?
[1124.37] Look at this, phone.
[1127.53] I cannot take this.
[1130.13] Hey, why can you take it? 
Don’t you love me?
[1133.33] I love you, but…
[1135.33] But, what?
[1137.80] But, I cannot take this.
[1141.30] What will I say at home?
[1143.30] Hey, no one at home will find out.
[1145.50] You don’t have to tell anyone, 
you have a phone.
[1148.40] Keep it.
[1151.03] Yes, but…
[1154.70] But, what? Is there a problem 
taking it from me?
[1157.90] Look, there was such 
an issue earlier too,
[1160.03] when we couldn’t get in contact 
and even when we had met,
[1163.37] we couldn’t talk.
[1166.10] Keep it.
[1168.33] Don’t you feel like talking to me?
[1171.97] I want to.
[1173.70] You want to, right? Keep it.
[1176.93] I will keep it here.
[1179.67] Now, we will talk to each other
whenever you want,
[1184.40] and I have put a sim in this, 
so there is not a problem. Okay?
[1189.63] And you know,
[1190.97] after meeting today,
[1193.73] I will want to talk even more.
[1196.07] So, we will not be able to 
manage without them.
[1202.33] Shall we go?
[1205.77] Finish your ice cream first.
[1207.80] We will be late. 
Hey, finish it.
[1209.60] Come on, eat. 
Here. Eat it.
[1213.93] We are going. 
Five minutes.
[1271.87] Listen, you are coming now?
So, late.
[1277.93] Yes,
[1279.40] the bus broke down, 
so I changed two buses and came.
[1288.20] Thank God Mama is in a good mood,
[1290.07] or else you would have gotten 
scolded for being late.
[1292.23] Okay, I will be thankful too,
[1294.43] but tell me, why is she in a good mood?
[1296.80] The boy’s family visited and went.
[1299.40] They had to come in the evening, right?
[1301.00] Yes, they had to come in the evening.
[1302.80] Naseeban Bua had to go somewhere,
[1305.37] so they brought them soon.
[1308.10] What is this? 
I too wanted to see him.
[1310.27] Who all came? 
How were they?
[1312.57] They were good, 
decent people,
[1314.93] and the mother and daughter came.
[1317.57] They really liked our Fiza.
[1320.53] Our Fiza is so pretty, 
anyone will like her.
[1324.87] The boy is also really good.
[1327.63] Where did you see him?
[1329.60] His mother brought a picture.
[1332.87] He is really handsome.
[1334.33] We really liked him, 
and sister liked him too.
[1339.73] Also show me.
[1342.13] Sister Kausar took the picture along.
[1345.27] Hey, I didn’t think about it 
that I would have kept it.
[1347.37] I also had to show it to your papa.
[1349.70] Anyway, when he goes 
he will see him, himself.
[1352.37] So, you should have kept it for me.
[1356.83] Okay, come on,
[1359.23] tell me the name.
[1362.70] Sarfaraz.
[1368.37] The name is good.
[1371.50] Are you happy?
[1372.93] A lot.
[1379.53] Where is this phone ringing?
[1384.07] Huh?
[1385.97] Where did a phone come from,
at our home?
[1388.73] Dua, the sound is coming 
from your bag.
[1391.97] Dua,
[1393.67] I have told you a thousand times 
to keep the door closed.
[1396.87] get up, get up.
[1400.07] Strangers peek in here.
[1402.03] Where the hell is everyone?
[1404.17] Are you all drunk?
[1406.90] No, go ahead.
[1409.10] What do I have to say? 
Here, take it.
[1412.67] Cook something good.
[1420.20] How do you switch this off?
[1429.37] Here.
[1430.33] Water.
[1441.00] Warm water.
[1443.50] Hey, I have come from 
after walking in the sun.
[1445.03] You couldn’t add a little syrup, 
add a little ice to it.
[1450.10] Where are you going?
[1451.63] To get the syrup.
[1452.87] No need to bring the syrup.
[1455.93] Hasn’t Dua come?
[1458.50] Yes, she just came.
[1460.37] Is this the time to come?
[1468.07] Make her understand to come on time.
[1469.90] She shouldn’t go around all the time.
[1471.70] She should care for her father’s honor.
[1475.00] Now get out of here.
[1486.10] Mama.
[1487.80] She’s not picking up the call?
[1490.30] I couldn’t even think
[1492.20] that you would take undue advantage 
of the leniency I have given you.
[1497.97] Where did you get this phone from?
[1500.73] Mama…
[1502.20] Ask her.
[1503.57] Ask her,
[1505.10] where she got it from?
[1507.07] Hey, if your father had seen it,
[1510.43] all hell would have broken loose 
in this home by now.
[1513.63] You two would have had 
to face harshness,
[1515.70] my upbringing would have been 
questioned,
[1517.23] only because of her. 
What are you doing? Leave her.
[1520.03] Fine. Kill me. Kill me. Don’t leave me.
[1522.77] I will also be spared.
[1524.27] If you kill me, then at least the fire 
of this home will be cooled down.
[1528.77] I too will get free from the home 
where you cannot even breathe.
[1531.90] Questions are asked about it.
[1533.90] Do you hear that? 
Do you see her argue?
[1536.77] She is being stubborn 
after doing wrong.
[1538.47] Mama, right now…
No.
[1539.67] What wrong have I done? 
Tell me.
[1541.33] What wrong have I done?
[1542.27] No need to argue with Mama.
[1545.00] Answer the question 
where did you get this phone from?
[1548.30] Had Papa seen it,
[1549.47] then you know hell would have 
broken loose.
[1550.93] You know how much 
he hates these things.
[1553.50] So, what if he hates it?
[1554.63] When did I steal it or rob it?
[1557.40] I don’t even know. 
When is this my phone?
[1560.83] If it is not your phone, 
then where did you get it from?
[1563.83] This is Rida’s phone.
[1565.73] We are together all the time.
[1568.63] In the class, in the canteen,
[1570.93] she must have kept it 
by mistake in my bag,
[1574.27] thinking it was her bag.
[1577.10] How was I to know that
[1578.17] I would get slapped so many times,
because of her mistake?
[1580.43] Had I known, 
I would have kept it in a lock.
[1583.10] Dua,
[1586.30] you are really speaking the truth, right?
[1588.73] No. I don’t…
[1591.17] I don’t go to the university,
[1593.17] I go to the stock exchange,
[1595.40] where I earn millions,
[1596.83] and I bought such an expensive phone.
[1599.90] Rida told me yesterday
[1601.33] that her father bought her a phone
 worth twenty-five thousand.
[1605.77] The parents of people do 
so much for their children,
[1607.93] they buy them phones,
they do everything,
[1610.60] I am the one who is getting 
beaten here.
[1619.03] It must be Rida’s phone.
[1621.07] She must be calling from her brother’s 
number to ask where the phone is.
[1627.60] This.
[1631.07] Hello, Rida.
[1632.77] Rida?
[1633.57] Your phone came in my bag by mistake.
[1637.30] I have kept it safe with me.
[1639.23] When I come tomorrow 
take it from me, okay?
[1641.20] Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine.
[1644.00] Goodbye.
[1648.73] I think her phone got caught.
[1651.77] That’s it? Do you believe me?
[1654.20] No, tell me, how else do I make 
you people believe?
[1660.13] Whoever is your friend,
[1662.53] return the phone to her 
in the morning
[1665.23] and make her understand this well
[1668.20] not to make this mistake again.
[1688.97] Greetings sir. 
Greetings sir.
[1690.80] Greetings.
[1692.17] Sit.
[1696.70] Yes,
[1697.77] now tell us your problem.
[1701.63] Yes, Rab Nawaz,
[1704.53] tell me how the crop was this time.
[1706.53] Sir, the crop turned out to be good.
[1708.83] I get a good payment because 
of God’s blessing and your help,
[1712.33] that I don’t have to go 
to the city and sell it.
[1715.70] Okay, that’s a good thing.
[1717.50] Yes, sir.
[1718.53] It is because of you that prosperity
has come to this village.
[1721.73] Hmmm.
[1722.63] If there is any issue, 
then tell me.
[1725.10] Sir, there is one issue.
[1727.23] You know, I also started a milk 
and yogurt business last year.
[1731.90] My cows died a few days back,
[1734.37] I am worried because of that.
[1736.97] And, it has also affected 
the business a lot.
[1739.23] If you do me a favor and give me
a loan to buy two cows,
[1742.90] I will return the money soon.
[1745.87] Hmmm.
[1748.10] Give Rab Nawaz money 
to buy two cows.
[1750.50] Yes, sir.
[1751.73] Sir, thank you. thank you very much.
[1755.07] Okay, Rab Nawaz, one cow from 
this is a gift for you from us,
[1759.20] pay off the loan for the other.
[1762.23] That too only because you don’t 
get used to getting things for free.
[1766.70] The earnings of self-respect are 
something else altogether.
[1769.77] Yes?
[1770.83] Yes, sir. You are absolutely right.
[1773.97] Sir, I brought a small present for you,
[1776.93] I will just bring it.
[1782.20] Sir, I made this sweet yogurt for you
 with my own hands.
[1786.93] You will not get the yogurt made
by Rab Nawaz anywhere in the city.
[1791.23] Accept it, sir.
[1794.30] Thank you.
[1802.00] Ghulam Sarwar,
[1803.90] you are insisting on meeting, sir.
[1807.50] Come tell him, 
what is the issue?
[1815.93] Greetings, sir.
[1817.63] Sir, I have been waiting for you
for a long time,
[1820.63] that when you will come, 
I will put my issue in front of you.
[1824.20] I am amongst you, go ahead.
[1826.07] Tell me, what is the issue?
[1827.27] Sir, my daughter’s wedding 
is next month,
[1830.60] and he…
[1831.73] he says he won't let my daughter 
get married.
[1837.03] Why? What issue do you have?
[1838.93] Why won't you let it happen?
[1840.83] How can Sahiba get married 
to someone else?
[1843.37] I have loved her since childhood.
[1846.70] Only your love doesn’t make a difference.
[1849.67] It is necessary to know if the girl wants 
to marry you or not.
[1853.13] She too loves me.
[1855.07] They formed a relationship in good times,
[1856.97] and Uncle Ghulam finished the relationship
when he found a good proposal.
[1860.27] Sir, he is lying.
[1861.57] My daughter agrees to that proposal.
[1863.50] Don’t lie so much, Uncle Ghulam.
[1865.30] Care for your age a little.
[1867.40] For God’s sake. For God’s sake, 
leave my daughter alone.
[1871.77] I will never leave her alone.
[1873.03] I will see how you marry her 
to someone else with me there.
[1876.50] I will make her disappear 
on the day of the wedding.
[1880.03] Sir, did you see? 
Did you see?
[1882.03] He threatens my daughter like this.
[1884.73] He follows my daughter everywhere.
[1887.87] Sir, her wedding is next month,
[1889.53] if her in-laws find out,
[1891.47] then her wedding will end 
before it happens.
[1894.03] Then who will marry my daughter?
[1896.27] No one will marry her.
[1900.23] I will cut her husband into pieces.
[1902.43] Sahiba is only mine.
[1904.03] Uncle, marry her off to me with respect,
[1906.30] or you will suffer the consequences.
[1907.83] Talk with respect.
[1913.43] This matter came to me.
[1916.67] I will decide what decision 
needs to be made.
[1920.67] Speak up, Ghulam Sarwar. 
What will you do?
[1927.73] He has Sahiba locked up 
in the home for ten days.
[1930.33] Don’t talk loudly.
[1938.83] My people will go and ask that girl.
[1942.90] If she wants to marry you,
[1944.50] then I will get both of you married.
[1946.40] She will never speak up, 
he has her threatened.
[1949.20] He even raises his hand at her.
[1950.90] He is not a father, 
he is a butcher.
[1952.50] Don’t forget,
[1953.80] he is the father of the girl 
you want to marry.
[1956.40] He may be the father in his home.
[1958.33] If he says something wrong to me, 
then I will not tolerate it.
[1960.27] I told you to talk with respect.
[1962.60] Hey, leave it.
[1963.77] I don’t believe any court of yours.
[1975.10] Who are you to decide 
about my marriage?
[1977.43] I will do whatever happens.
[1979.00] And uncle you too listen, 
your daughter will only marry me.
[1982.37] If you even try, 
I will kidnap her and…
[1984.80] How dare you?
[2002.70] You are talking about kidnapping
a girl of my village.
[2007.80] How dare you?
[2010.23] What do you think?
I will leave you?
