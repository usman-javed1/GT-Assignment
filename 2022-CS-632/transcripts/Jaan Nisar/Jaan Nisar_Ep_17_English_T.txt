[24.84] Do you want to get out of there?
[35.72] And what do I have to pay for this freedom?
[42.36] You won’t have to pay anything.
[44.72] Then why this kindness for me?
[48.72] When you have come here looking for me,
[51.40] you will also know
[53.72] that my own family closed
the doors of my house on me.
[59.84] I know that,
[62.88] if you need a house to stay,
my house is there for you.
[67.40] You can live there comfortably.
[72.64] I will keep all the blessings of
this world on your feet.
[77.52] I guess you are saying all this
[82.36] because you have bought my time
by giving that cheque to Zunaira,
[89.52] and you think that you keep me
in your luxurious house
[95.92] by throwing a lot of such
cheques on her face.
[101.28] The first time,
[104.00] the first time before putting
a price on me,
[107.72] you didn’t even for once ask me
what I wanted,
[112.48] and I came with you,
[114.88] but luck won’t be in your favor
for the second time.
[123.20] Zunaira can be inspired by your money
and position, but not me.
[128.84] You are getting me wrong,
[133.40] I have especially only offered you
to stay in my house,
[138.88] if I was some wrong man,
[140.36] I would have given this offer to
a lot of more girls before you.
[146.12] Then, why now?
[148.80] As per what relationship
can I live in your house?
[154.56] It will be better if we don’t talk
about this topic again.
[159.92] Not every woman gets sold for money.
[168.20] Will you marry me?
[214.92] Bashir,
[218.32] didn’t she come yet?
[220.16] No.
[223.16] She should have come by now.
[225.44] You shouldn’t have just trusted someone.
[229.80] He is not someone,
[232.32] he is Mr. Nosherwan Ghaznavi, you fool.
[238.84] Rumi,
[240.64] has Dua ever discussed with you
[243.76] that she knows some Ghaznavi or
[247.20] met him somewhere in the past?
[249.48] No,
[251.16] she never discussed it with me.
[254.00] In fact,
[255.24] I think she is meeting him
for the first time today.
[258.44] She has already wounded one man,
[262.40] that clamored-fussy Dua,
[264.68] had she been meeting Ghaznavi
for the first time,
[268.12] she wouldn’t have gone
with him so easily.
[272.04] Absolutely,
[273.44] Shall I find out if you say?
[275.64] You will have to find out.
[278.72] But for now, find out where are they.
[281.52] Okay.
[282.08] There is no need to send
anyone anywhere.
[302.68] So, you guys are back.
[306.44] When I promised you and took Dua,
[309.84] then why do you look so restless?
[312.40] I and restless?
[314.48] Not at all.
[317.28] Actually, Dua is not aware of the habits
and manners of this place yet.
[321.72] I was worried that
[323.72] something might happen
that you might not like.
[328.28] You might not like
[332.44] what I am about to talk to you.
[337.92] What has happened?
[341.24] No one should put their eye on her now.
[353.20] I didn’t get it.
[356.36] I have used very clear
and easy language.
[366.52] But I will die starving that way.
[372.00] You will eventually die
if you don’t listen to me.
[378.12] Only I have a right on her
[381.76] and you cannot take this right away
from me at all.
[386.20] I admit, Mr. Ghaznavi that
your money, wealth, name,
[392.40] and power talk in this city,
[396.04] but we know some people here as well.
[403.00] You paid to take her along, I allowed,
[408.52] but now what you are doing is wrong.
[415.04] Only I have the right to make any decision
[419.52] and you cannot do anything about it.
[437.56] Let’s not talk about what I can do
and what I cannot,
[444.40] I can take Dua away in front of your
eyes right here, right now, if I want to,
[454.72] and even your pet animals
cannot stop me from doing this.
[460.96] I will come tomorrow,
[464.56] till then she is as my possession
here with you.
[476.48] I will pay as much as you want
to get Dua out of this prison,
[487.00] and that won’t be Dua’s price,
[490.64] but it will be a charity
in her name for you all.
[497.32] I am marrying Dua.
[515.44] And I hope you will not give
my wife-to-be
[518.72] any sort of chance to complain.
[534.28] Keep this.
[538.60] I will be worried for you.
[542.00] Only this phone can make up
for the distance between us for now.
[551.80] Be careful
[554.40] that this phone shouldn’t be turned off,
[557.88] otherwise, I won’t feel even
the slightest bit of pain
[560.04] in stopping the breaths of
the people over here.
[564.32] As you wish.
[572.64] I will come tomorrow,
[576.56] wait for me.
[610.20] You turned out to be very secretive,
[611.84] you didn't even tell me you knew him.
[615.56] I, myself am unaware of
what is happening to me,
[620.80] how would have I told you?
[622.68] It means the guy is involved
in one-sided love?
[628.64] I don’t know,
[631.84] I didn’t ask him.
[635.12] Hey, why are you making me mad?
[638.44] Okay, tell me,
[640.40] when did you meet Nosherwan?
[642.68] First time,
[646.04] I guess a few days before I came here.
[652.60] And how was that meeting?
[668.68] It means that you slapped
Nosherwan’s scout,
[671.80] and you scolded him and left?
[673.60] I only met him then,
[676.60] it was a short meeting
[678.80] and then I saw him
at the party last night.
[683.96] You agree or not,
[685.88] the guy has fallen for you big time.
[690.84] I don’t know.
[697.04] Why are you sad?
[699.56] You should be happy.
[704.56] He,
[706.96] He,
[709.12] he knows what hell
I have been through.
[714.80] True love doesn’t give
importance to anything.
[718.40] Nosherwan loved you with
all his heart and he got you.
[722.36] And look,
[723.88] how easily he spoke about
taking you out of here.
[729.84] I can’t believe it.
[731.60] A prince came after you without
you having to lose your shoe like Cinderella,
[735.60] so who would believe it?
[738.52] Now forget all the worries and be happy.
[741.96] By the way, did you see Zunaira’s face?
[744.24] I swear I felt pity for the poor woman.
[749.56] I am very happy for you Dua,
[752.64] I have never seen this happening here,
[756.00] that a hero would come and
take his heroine from here.
[761.20] You are actually very lucky.
[770.56] If I was lucky,
[774.56] I wouldn’t be here.
[788.64] How did you agree?
[794.36] I am surprised.
[796.20] What else would have I done
if I hadn’t agreed?
[799.60] Should I have become
enemies with Ghaznavi?
[806.68] And had I done this,
[808.20] he would have made us pack our bags
and taken us far away from the city
[812.24] and would have gotten us killed by
[816.60] anonymous people at
an anonymous location.
[820.84] We are not that helpless either,
[829.52] we could have used our cards too.
[833.36] I guess you are forgetting
[836.24] that Ghaznavi can very successfully
play our cards against us.
[843.48] You know that, right?
[845.12] If Dua leaves,
[846.88] all the girls will get rebellious
in the future.
[849.96] Don’t worry,
[852.60] not everyone is that brave.
[856.92] Anyway,
[858.68] let’s see what he pays for his love.
[867.00] Okay,
[868.96] now that you have decided everything,
[872.08] what can I do?
[873.52] Let that nobleman take Dua
out of here once,
[878.92] I know the nature of
these men very well,
[885.76] I recognize it very well.
[887.72] The faster they fall into
the passion of love,
[893.72] the faster they come out of it.
[898.12] It would be moonlight for four days.
[924.12] What will you wear in the morning?
[926.32] Let me know, I will iron them too.
[930.76] Why? Where do I have to go?
[934.96] Dad said you will assist him
at the shop until you get a job.
[942.16] Dad said and I heard
[945.28] and it’s up to me to implement it.
[948.48] Do you understand?
[951.16] And this is not the first time
that he asked me.
[954.04] What do you mean?
[955.88] Won’t he mind it?
[958.24] Why are you so worried about him?
[960.44] He is my father, I know
[962.52] and no one knows him better than me.
[964.32] He wants me to go and sit at that shop
[967.32] but I do what I feel like,
[970.00] so shut up with your rubbish.
[971.76] Yes,
[973.04] but there is also a lot of difference
between then and now,
[976.36] you are married now,
[978.52] you need to seriously think
about a job or business now.
[985.64] Now you will tell me
what I have to do?
[990.08] No, I was just saying,
[993.40] you should assist Dad…
Okay, okay, okay,
[996.36] I get it,
[997.88] actually you are jealous that you are
going to work from tomorrow at your school,
[1002.00] and I will be sitting at home,
that is your problem, right?
[1004.32] No, why would I think that?
[1007.44] Don’t even think that,
do you understand?
[1011.36] Do you know, you are being
upset for no reason?
[1014.16] No reason?
[1015.32] I am doing all this without a reason?
[1017.52] Don’t get me started,
do you understand?
[1019.84] Even now I am just tolerating you
in this house because of my father,
[1022.52] otherwise, I would have thrown
you out a long time back.
[1028.68] I cannot even sit in my room in peace.
[1030.84] Move!
Sarfaraz?
[1032.44] What happened? Where is he going?
[1034.32] What happened to him?
[1036.32] What happened?
[1037.12] Why did he get upset and go out?
[1040.72] Nothing.
[1042.32] Nothing?
[1044.00] So, was he yelling for no reason?
[1045.64] Getting angry for no reason?
Went out for no reason? Yeah?
[1047.92] No, I was just trying to
make him understand that
[1053.36] he should get serious about a job now
[1056.28] and until he gets a job he should
sit at the shop with Dad.
[1060.00] Madam,
[1061.76] like you have kept Rs. 1000s
of worth of salary in my hands
[1066.24] that you don’t like your husband
sitting at home?
[1069.40] No,
[1071.24] I was just telling him.
[1073.32] Enough, enough, you don’t
need to be his grandmother,
[1076.08] his parents are still alive
to make him understand.
[1079.72] And if you really wanted to be a teacher,
[1082.68] you should have made
your sister understand,
[1084.76] like she has made the family very proud!
[1089.64] Bells call others to church
but don’t go themselves! Wow,
[1093.76] you are one to be a teacher
who will make others understand.
[1109.52] Sarfaraz?
[1111.56] Why are you following me like
a back-footed witch?
[1114.76] What is wrong with you?
[1116.92] Look, don’t eat my brain,
go away from here.
[1120.64] Why are you upset?
[1122.24] If I wasn’t upset,
[1123.52] I would still be sitting there listening
to your rubbish.
[1126.72] Okay, I won’t say anything.
Come, let’s go to the room.
[1130.24] Look, leave me alone and go away.
[1133.56] Listen,
[1134.72] if someone sees you here,
what will they think?
[1136.12] So let them see, someone will see.
[1139.36] Go.
[1140.96] Okay, listen, I made a mistake,
[1144.00] forgive me.
[1145.16] I don’t need your apology and
I don’t need your companionship.
[1148.04] Do you understand?
[1149.88] Get lost.
[1152.96] Why are you doing this to me?
[1154.96] What have I done to you?
[1157.44] Go inside and finish your drama
of whining and crying.
[1162.00] And if I hear your voice now,
I would be the worst.
[1165.76] Get lost.
[1169.92] Made a joke out of me.
[1171.84] Over everything…
[1174.84] Do this, do that, why aren’t you
going to the shop?
[1178.84] Like she is one to make me understand!
[1262.24] I have especially only offered you
to stay in my house,
[1265.68] if I was some wrong man,
[1267.32] I would have given this offer to
a lot more girls before you.
[1272.96] Then, why now?
[1275.76] As per what relationship can I live
in your house?
[1282.84] Will you marry me?
[1289.52] I will come tomorrow,
[1291.12] till then she is as my possession
here with you.
[1293.40] I will pay as much as you want
to get Dua out of this prison,
[1298.84] and that won’t be Dua’s price,
[1302.44] but it will be a charity
in her name for you all.
[1305.72] I am marrying Dua.
[1308.44] And I hope you will not give
my wife-to-be
[1311.60] any sort of chance to complain.
[1322.68] I will be worried for you.
[1325.40] Only this phone can make up for
the distance between us for now.
[1363.96] I was going to make breakfast,
[1365.80] you freshen up and come too.
[1367.48] Go, where you are getting ready to go.
[1371.56] There is no need to worry about me,
[1373.08] there are a lot of people to
take care of me in this house.
[1376.60] I don’t understand why are you
doing this to me.
[1380.92] I have been trying to make it
up to you all night,
[1384.28] but you didn’t even listen to me once.
[1386.56] Why should I listen to you?
[1389.28] I am your wife,
[1391.68] I have the right to question you.
[1394.08] You have no right, do you understand?
[1397.52] Now, get lost, don’t eat my brain.
[1401.20] First, this damn light woke me up
and now she is talking.
[1407.96] Why are you looking at my face?
Get out of here.
[1488.80] Sumbul will look after all this,
[1491.96] you quickly get ready,
have breakfast,
[1494.76] and go to school, I am afraid
you might miss your bus.
[1496.96] Okay.
[1497.76] Miss the bus?
What do you mean?
[1500.20] Isn’t Faraz responsible for picking up
and dropping her off at the school?
[1506.00] Yes, yes,
[1508.80] Sarfaraz is responsible,
[1510.80] but the thing is,
he has his interview today,
[1513.56] poor boy was preparing
for the interview all night,
[1516.48] he didn’t sleep at all
he just slept a while ago,
[1520.36] he asked me not to wake him up early,
[1522.96] so he can be fresh for the interview.
[1525.76] But brother was sleeping on the roof.
[1528.08] He went to the roof with the laptop
so Fiza’s sleep would not be disturbed,
[1532.40] he was doing his preparations over there,
and he might have fallen asleep.
[1535.52] But it doesn’t seem right that Fiza
should go to the school alone like this,
[1540.32] she is the daughter-in-law of our house.
[1541.84] Why doesn’t it look right?
[1543.60] Fiza used to go alone before as well.
[1546.80] Right, Fiza?
[1547.52] Do you have a problem going?
[1550.80] No, I will, I will manage,
you let Sarfaraz rest.
[1556.48] See, your daughter-in-law is so sensible.
[1559.68] I know that my daughter-in-law
is very intelligent.
[1563.56] And your useless son should be thankful
[1567.44] to get a sensible girl like her as a wife.
[1571.04] Okay, my child, Fiza,
[1572.24] you must go and quickly get ready, okay?
[1575.16] Go.
[1577.48] Hey, at least let her properly
have her breakfast.
[1580.72] No, I am done.
[1582.88] Go.
[1591.40] And if your useless son didn’t have
to go to drop Fiza,
[1595.56] he could have at least had
breakfast with us.
[1599.04] I told you he wanted
to get enough sleep.
[1604.44] Let him get enough sleep! Hmph!
[1615.16] Brother, are we going the right way?
[1616.96] Sister, we are going the right way,
absolutely right way.
[1625.48] Driver a little fast,
I am getting late.
[1627.88] Sister, I am driving fast,
how fast should I drive?
[1647.88] Fiza?
[1649.56] Mom?
[1651.08] Mom?
[1652.32] My child.
How are you sister?
[1654.80] School this early morning?
[1657.24] I have rejoined the school from today.
[1661.84] You have joined the school?
[1665.44] My child, it hasn’t been many days
since your wedding.
[1668.52] And you said you won’t.
[1670.16] Yes, but I have rejoined now,
[1673.24] are you here to drop Sania?
[1675.44] Where were you yesterday?
I looked for you so much as well.
[1678.68] Dad wasn’t in favor of me
going back to school,
[1681.72] Mom has taken permission
to pick me up and drop me off,
[1684.28] so he got convinced
after so much difficulty.
[1687.80] Why did you join the school?
[1692.28] You should have given time
to your in-laws.
[1695.20] I am very late, Mom,
assembly must have started.
[1697.76] We are actually very late, Mom,
[1699.48] you go home, I will come home
with sister Fiza,
[1702.36] then we will sit and talk properly.
[1704.16] No, I will go back to my home, Sania.
[1708.12] Umm,
[1709.12] no my child, both of you come home,
[1711.60] have food, and then go,
[1713.16] in fact, call Sarfaraz and
ask him to pick you up.
[1716.16] Sarfaraz is busy with his interview,
[1718.24] that is why I am saying I will come
some other day.
[1720.60] And why are you standing here?
You will get punished, quickly go,
[1723.40] the assembly has started. Mom,
you must go home now,
[1726.00] I will take care of Sania.
Okay, I am getting late. Bye.
[1735.96] Jaffar, are all the preparations
for the evening done?
[1738.96] Yes,
[1740.44] all the preparations including
the Muslim Scholar are completed.
[1743.48] You won’t have any complaints.
[1747.08] You have never given a chance
to complain that you will give now.
[1752.12] Thank you.
[1801.52] Greetings, Mom.
[1803.40] Greetings.
[1805.36] I was just coming to pick you up,
you came all alone.
[1808.40] Your Dad will be so mad if he finds out.
[1811.72] I haven’t come alone,
[1813.44] sister dropped me
at the corner of the road.
[1818.16] If Fiza was here,
you should have brought her home.
[1821.08] I insisted her a lot,
[1823.12] but she didn’t agree,
[1824.76] she was just saying
she was getting late.
[1830.52] Mom.
[1831.68] Hasn’t sister started to act
strange very soon?
[1835.40] Sister wasn’t like this.
[1840.16] My child, a sensible girl does this
after getting married,
[1846.28] she tries to hide from her family.
[1852.12] I felt she was also on purpose
avoiding me at school
[1856.36] so I don’t ask her something.
[1859.48] Hmm,
[1862.56] I felt that too.,
[1867.68] Fiza is definitely hiding something.
[1869.84] Sister never even traveled
in public transport,
[1873.52] school and college both were nearby.
[1876.80] She must be facing so much difficulty.
[1880.28] Brother Sarfaraz could have
dropped her too.
[1883.60] I don’t know what is it,
[1886.32] I am very worried for Fiza.
[1891.04] Mom, why did sister join school so soon?
[1895.04] Are her in-laws forcing her?
[1900.60] God knows.
[1903.40] Okay,
[1905.16] don’t talk about Fiza’s school joining
in front of your Dad.
[1911.80] But until when can we hide it from him?
[1915.20] First let me talk to Fiza myself
[1918.24] then I will tell him.
[1919.96] Okay,
[1921.60] I am very hungry.
[1923.28] Get food for both of us.
I will come to lay it.
[1927.24] No, you freshen up,
I will lay it.
[1929.20] No, I will lay it,
you just dish it out.
[1980.60] Hmm.
[1984.40] Hmm.
[1990.20] Okay.
[2090.64] Yes, greetings, Baba Saeein.
