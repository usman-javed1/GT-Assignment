Do you think that if we have given you the permission 
to take her for dinner, and to come home, 
that means we trust you? This is not true at all. Maybe you are forgetting that 
your sister is now my wife. Yes, but that doesn’t mean we trust you. You are insulting me. Then tolerate it. That poor thing is innocent, but she doesn’t know 
what is going on these days. People get married, 
get engaged, and so much is happening 
in the guise of that. And we really don’t trust you because what if you say no to taking her from here?
What if you come and say this is not possible? Then what will we do? What kind of a person are you? Are you not ashamed of saying such 
nasty things about your own sister? Hey, it is you who should be ashamed. Do you think I am stupid? By making the excuse of the dinner, 
you want to make her the limelight of hotels? Shut up. I have been listening to 
your nonsense for so long. Have a look. Your brother is saying such nasty things. He is such a disgusting man. -Whom did you call disgusting?
-Khizar? Leave him. 
Khizar? Get hold of your brother. And hats off to you. 
In fact, I’d rather salute you that you are tolerating this evil man. You feel so much pain for her, right? Take her with you. Get out. Get out. Go. Khizar? Khizar? Khizar? I would go to dinner. I would go to dinner.
I would go to dinner. Explain it to him, do you understand? I am watching everything. And what are you looking at my face
 while standing here? Yes? You’re here to watch the spectacle. 
Go from here. Here he comes. I would go to dinner. Here is your green tea, Baba Saeein. Live long, child. You take great care of everyone. Not just everyone, our daughter-in-law handles 
the whole mansion. Kashmala, the food was really tasty today. Thank you, Amma Saeein. Since I am the elder 
daughter-in-law of the mansion, I have to do everything 
according to your glory. Indeed. Thank you so much. Seeing everyone together here 
makes me feel so happy. You are right, Saeein. Today, it feels like our mansion is complete. There is just one thing missing. What is missing, mother? Now Dua and I are also with you. Our eyes yearn to see your offspring. Yes. Your Amma Saeein is right. After seeing your children, I will not be sad about dying. Baba Saeein, don’t say such things. Just get well soon. We will give you the good news soon. When I already told you that 
I gave them permission, then why did you mess up with him? Did I mess up with him? He was showing his fondness 
for being a policeperson. I know really well. I know you and him really well. Hey? Not even two days have passed 
since your sister’s wedding. Will you ruin her home? Yes, then let it be. Talk sensibly. I should talk sensibly. Not more than two days have passed 
since we got into a relationship with him. And in this house, while standing here, he abused me. He said I am disgusting. And it doesn’t make any difference
 to you people? It would have made some difference. It would have made some
difference had I believed that you treated him nicely. But no. Hey, he is not mad that he would stand here 
and call you disgusting. Okay. Okay, now it means you are saying
 that it’s my mistake. It can be yours. No, no. What do you mean it can be yours? Say that it’s my mistake. 
It is one hundred percent my mistake. Sarfaraz, don’t drag the matter. Okay, you want me to praise someone 
who came to this house and misbehaved with me. You want me to unite heaven 
and Earth while praising him. This is what you want, right? You shouldn’t have come 
in front of him. If you didn’t come here, 
that matter wouldn’t get worse. Oh, okay, okay, okay. That means whatever would happen 
in this house will be done as per his will. Tell me one thing. You are giving away 
your daughter to him. Are you also transferring 
this house to his name? Don’t misbehave, Sarfaraz. I am not misbehaving. I just realized today 
what my status is in this house. And look at her. He insulted her brother. But she is shedding tears 
for the one who is offended. For God’s sake, spare someone. Look at her. 
How worried she is! She just got married and 
you created this scene. What scene? You people have no idea 
what a person he is. I mean, what is her relationship with him? Yes? He said to me that you are an evil man. And that she is compelled to live with you. What does your daughter-in-law 
have anything to do with him? Anyone other than Khizar would have
 said the same thing. This is really Sister-in-law’s courage 
that she is tolerating you. You don’t even care about Sister-in-law’s honour,
nor your sister’s house. You are good for no relation, Brother. 
You are good for nothing. Amazing! Are you listening to her? Yes? I mean, she just got married two days ago 
and she is abusing me? But okay. Okay, do whatever you want to do. But if he comes to this house, I will treat him exactly like this. In fact, I would treat him 
even worse than this. Remember this. He will only stop after
ruining his sister’s house. What are you saying? 
Why are you scaring us? Hey, did you see his behavior? Ill-fated! Madam? Isn’t her heart full after entering Nosherwan’s life that now… Now she is here to set my heart on fire. She didn’t just come. In fact, Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein 
are pampering her with their love. Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein 
were asking her for children. The way Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein 
were asking her for grandchildren, I am also afraid that she has come permanently into Sir’s life. She will snatch your position. Nothing as such can happen. Nobody can take my place. I will kick her out of Sir’s life very soon. What will you do? Although she has come here She will not go back alive from here. I will not let her go back alive. He is distracted as you people came back. Otherwise, he was just talking 
about dying for so long. Don’t worry. Nothing will happen to Baba Saeein. I am just praying that may I die before him. That woman is so lucky whose husband buries her 
in her grave with his own hands. You love Baba Saeein so much, right? Pretty much. Just the way you love Nosherwan. You do, right? Yes. Just keep loving him like this. Don’t ever cheat him. Nosherwan deeply loves you now. That is why he didn’t even get trapped in Farah’s trap. -Amma Saeein, Farah…
-We all know. We know she has a son, and her husband didn’t even divorce her. Who told you? Ghaznavi? We do live away from you. But Saeein does keep an eye 
on his son’s friends and enemies. He knows it all. When he is here, no one can do anything to you. I heard about Brother Zawar. I am so sorry to hear that. How enemies shot him! Yes. But we also didn’t spare a single 
person from our enemy’s family. Only their distant relatives ran away 
and saved their lives. They still get together and try to attack. But then they get defeated badly
 and go missing. Anyway, it is very late at night. You should go to sleep too. We will have a chat in the morning. I have got your room ready. Yes, Amma Saeein. You will go to your room yourself or shall I call Pirah to 
take you to your room? No, no. I will go myself. Live long. Go take some rest. Good night. Goodbye. You are so stubborn. After all that happened, 
you are still with Nosherwan. Do you know? 
I am amazed sometimes. I also feel pity. When you are not happy here, you should marry someone else and go somewhere. Because that is what 
everyone else wants too. What are you saying? I am Nosherwan’s first wife. Who is his first wife and who is second, what difference does it make? What actually makes the difference is to whom Ghaznavi gave this status. You are so proud of this, aren’t you? Dua, this pride will be broken one day. By attacking me, and creating misunderstandings between us… You have tried this so many times. If this is what makes you happy, then you can try one more time. Kashmala, I really want to see you happy. You should get married to someone else
 and live a happy peaceful life. Keep these useless suggestions 
of yours to yourself. Time will tell who will get what. It’s you. I was scared. I was coming to see you that what if you go missing
in the mazes of this mansion? Even if I go missing somewhere, these doors and walls are familiar to you. They will tell me about your whereabouts. I have this idea about your love. That even if I go missing somewhere, you will find me. How did you find this mansion? Very nice. Very glorious. Far away from the noises of the city. Way bigger than my house. This is our family symbol. My grandfather built this. Do you like living here? With you, anywhere. Come. Why is Khizar so worried about you? Hmm? What is going on between you two? What are you saying? He is Sumbul’s husband. 
He is respectable to me. He is nothing for you. 
Do you understand? What are you doing? 
Leave me. What kinds of things do you say? 
What types of things do you think about? I fall from my own grace 
when you say such things. Do you think I am as such? That with the husband of 
my sister-in-law, I will… The saddest thing is that you say what I cannot even think of. Sumbul? What happened? Why are you crying? Khizar is not picking up my call. Then leave him a text. Maybe he is busy and 
didn’t see while working. He will call back. It can never happen that 
he gets this busy that he doesn’t reply 
to my calls or messages. How Brother behaved with him yesterday, he is very angry because of that. Okay, don’t worry. Everything will be fine. How will it get better? As long as Brother is here, 
how can it get better? If crying would make it better, 
then I will also start crying with you. So that everything gets better. Hmm? What should I do, Sister-in-law? Be courageous. How can I be courageous? He is not talking to me. Brother shouldn’t have done this. Your brother shouldn’t have
 done a lot of things. But he is doing them all, right? Father is here, right? You will see, Father will explain it to Khizar. It will be better if you don’t talk to him for now. He is angry. Once his anger vanishes, then you can talk to him, please. He will not talk to me. He is of a very different nature. Brother did so wrong. He did so wrong. Okay but it is done now, isn’t it? Sit down here. Sit down. Don’t cry this much. It will be done. Solutions do come out of 
the conversations. Okay? You used to laugh all the time. 
What happened to you? Give me some water. Thank you. You must be satisfied seeing me 
better than before. No matter how much I thank God, 
it will be less. Otherwise, you scared me off. I am still scared. Of what? Kashmala. You are right. Seeing Kashmala’s mental state, I sometimes get scared a lot as well. Explain it to her that she should stop waiting for Nosherwan. And she should get herself mentally 
prepared for her new voyage. What do you think I didn’t explain it to her? I did it several times. Not by considering her my daughter-in-law, but as my daughter. But she doesn’t listen to me or agree with me. She cries whenever I talk to her. She is being stupid. She will be at a loss by doing this. Okay don’t get worried by thinking about this. Get some rest. Let me go make soup and oatmeal
for you with my own hands. Hmm? After asking about Kashmala’s consent, choose someone else for her. Nothing will be gained from 
this relationship except for loss. Kashmala’s deprivations are driving her to take revenge from me. The attack that was done on me and 
my group was done by Kashmala. She conspired to kill my wife. Believe me, Baba Saeein. If someone else did this act apart from her, I would have answered them by now. But since Kashmala is related to this mansion, that is why once again, 
my hands are tied. To get her out of this jealousy 
and enmity, it is necessary that you make arrangements 
for her somewhere else. It is so pretty. -What is going on?
-Come, Nosherwan. Thanks to the Almighty that your Baba Saeein is feeling 
much better now. Yes, indeed. He will be even better in a couple of days. Let me do it today. Thank you. Both our daughters-in-law are very sensible. And we have seen Dua’s prudence in Karachi. As you both came back here and that all of you are together, 
your Baba Saeein is very happy. Yes. Well, do try to take great care
 of him when we go. Why? Are you people going back? Yes, Amma Saeein. I have a couple of really important 
meetings in Karachi. When will you go? 
You are still here for tonight, right? Yes, yes. We are here for tonight. We will leave in the morning. By the way, I was thinking that 
ever since Dua came here, she didn’t go out anywhere. 
Neither did she go on a tour. So, let’s do one thing. 
You can go if you want to. We will have Dua stay here 
with us in the mansion. No, Amma Saeein. Don’t be so cruel. It will be really difficult for me. Why? Don’t we have any rights over Dua? That’s it. I have decided. Dua will now stay with us in the mansion. You will also keep visiting 
the mansion with this excuse. As you say, Amma Saeein. Really? Then I will have to shift Karachi’s office here. Wow. The same Nosherwan who used to 
talk about running away from the mansion, today he is talking about 
shifting the office here. Pirah?
