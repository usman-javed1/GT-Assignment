[34.20] I have the entire video of the night 
you went to meet your lover,
[40.88] and I will make it viral 
if you don’t listen to me
[45.08] and go to meet Mr. Sarkar.
[74.64] This was the reason for your worry, right?
[80.00] I have brought it.
[88.36] Till I am alive,
[91.16] Zunaira or no other person 
in the world can harm you.
[98.76] Here you go,
[100.68] finish it with your hands,
[106.12] so that I never see the fear of 
something happening again.
[115.68] Till I am there,
[118.80] nothing will happen.
[146.68] When Ghaznavi watches your video
[150.48] and takes you out of his life 
by divorcing you, himself,
[153.80] then you will understand 
what I am saying.
[156.00] I don’t care about who was 
in your life before me, and who wasn’t.
[161.64] After today, no one other than me
 should have a place in your life.
[166.56] Keep the same trust in me, 
as you have in yourself.
[171.68] I will never embarrass you.
[174.40] That’s what I expect from you.
[193.04] Hey Dua, I'm envious of your fate.
[195.68] What a destiny you have, my friend.
[199.08] In what context are you talking?
[200.80] Are you really unaware?
[202.76] You know when Brother Nosherwan came, 
I was with Zunaira.
[206.32] Shamsher’s bones have been broken.
[208.52] He taught Zunaira such a lesson
[210.44] and then made her give up the video, 
it was really enjoyable.
[212.44] She's still sitting in shock.
[214.68] Didn't she tell you?
[218.28] He did.
[221.80] He has given me the DVD.
[223.64] So now you stay relaxed.
[226.48] Today’s lesson will be enough for Zunaira.
[228.80] In the future, she will think a hundred times 
before interfering in your life.
[232.80] Hmmm.
[233.68] By the way, he has given Zunaira a 
two-day ultimatum to leave the city, as well.
[237.76] I had no idea that he would 
do something like this,
[240.32] and even you didn’t tell me that 
he was coming here to teach Zunaira a lesson.
[245.84] When does he even tell me?
[248.88] Value him.
[250.68] Just stay loyal to them your whole life.
[253.92] Such appreciative people are found
 only by the lucky ones.
[280.60] Oh, Fehmida, 
we were just left to see this day.
[285.00] Your daughters have sworn
[288.56] to get their father humiliated 
by worthless people.
[292.96] What is poor Fiza’s fault in this?
[294.96] No, it is my fault,
[296.88] that I got married to an unfortunate 
woman like you
[299.56] and now three girls are hanging 
in my neck like a noose.
[303.12] What is wrong, Mr. Aslam? 
What are you saying?
[306.20] This is not the time to say these things. 
Our Fiza is in difficulty.
[309.24] If she is in difficulty,
then what should I do?
[311.08] Hey, we are her parents. 
Our daughter is not an orphan
[314.92] and her in-laws treat her
 the way they want.
[318.80] Oh, when he didn't get 
the decision he wanted,
[321.00] Sarfaraz even threatened to divorce her.
[323.32] Hey, Fehmida your daughters 
don’t have the sense or courage
[328.00] that they can handle their in-laws.
[330.40] That’s why I have to beg in front of the in-laws.
 You have to beg them.
[335.08] This is all the fault of your daughters.
[336.68] It is your fault, Mr. Aslam.
[338.60] I or my daughters have no fault in this.
[340.80] What are you saying?
[342.04] What do I have to do with this?
I am absolutely right.
[344.84] My daughter Fiza’s life is 
in difficulty because of you.
[349.04] What would it have cost you to keep 
the family matters within the family?
[355.12] You should have forgiven Dua 
and kept her at home.
[358.64] At least the character of these two daughters
 of mine wouldn’t be questioned.
[363.36] Who knows where that 
poor soul is wandering,
[365.60] and here we are sitting and 
lamenting over the fate of these two.
[367.88] Look, if you had brought up 
your daughters well,
[371.60] then today, neither you 
nor I would have had to see this day.
[374.12] Don’t blame me.
[375.32] I will blame you.
[376.84] I will blame you for everything.
[379.00] My daughters have been made 
a spectacle because of you.
[382.20] You are responsible for all this and 
I will never forgive you for this.
[385.96] I am telling you, 
I will never forgive you.
[388.96] I will never forgive you.
[410.92] Thank you.
[422.76] You didn’t tell me
[426.20] that you are going to Zunaira.
[430.44] Even you didn’t tell me.
[434.44] I had gotten scared
[437.28] about how you would react.
[443.16] The reason for getting scared?
[450.92] Do you still don’t trust me?
[456.88] I trust you the most.
[461.68] Then the reason for getting scared?
[471.48] What happened? Speak up.
[479.68] Now, if I have any fear
[484.60] then it is of losing you.
[491.44] Accepting me as who I am, how I am,
[498.96] you have elevated my respect.
[504.16] Those people had really scared me.
[510.32] I had gotten scared,
[513.20] that you…
[518.28] you might leave me.
[525.32] Even this thought makes me lose my breath.
[532.32] What if you also turn away from me?
[536.44] This will never happen.
[542.56] Trust me.
[545.04] I have just started trusting you.
[549.80] if something like this happens, then,
[553.20] my existence will be erased.
[556.24] I won't let it be erased.
[563.16] This is my promise to you.
[597.04] Brother Naseer,
[598.52] your son has not only cursed my daughter 
but also me, by putting this allegation.
[604.64] Why?
[605.56] What did he say that 
you are getting so upset?
[608.68] You, be quiet.
I am talking.
[610.76] Hey, he threatened her with divorce.
[612.60] Is this not a big thing for you?
[614.96] Look Sarfaraz has made a mistake.
[618.28] I apologize to you on his behalf.
[620.36] Hey, what will your apology do?
[622.48] Your son should apologize to all of us.
[625.16] What do I apologize for?
[628.56] You go to your room. I am talking.
[631.32] No, papa,
[633.08] let me talk.
[635.44] I too want to know what 
he wants me to apologize for.
[642.08] Your daughters are recovered, 
sometimes from the police stations,
[645.00] sometimes from ill-reputed places, 
and I should apologize?
[647.76] Are you in your senses?
Boy, talk with respect.
[652.68] I will not talk with respect. 
What will you do?
[655.24] And if you are so interested,
[656.76] then take her from here.
[657.96] I too am not interested 
in keeping her here.
[663.88] I don’t know what sort of character she has.
[666.88] Do you understand?
Hey,
[668.88] if you say another word,
[670.72] then I will pull out your tongue.
[672.36] Okay.
[673.60] Okay. So you are unable 
to handle your daughters,
[676.00] and you will pull my tongue?
[678.20] Mr. Naseer, is this the upbringing 
you have given your son?
[681.04] Hey, why are you questioning our upbringing?
[683.56] Had you brought up your daughters well,
[686.64] then you wouldn’t have had to 
get humiliated in front of us today.
[691.12] Hey, Sister Kausar, 
you are a mother.
[694.00] You show some wisdom.
[696.04] We have come here to mend the relationship
 and you are talking about breaking it?
[700.00] Yes, so I told you to take her from here.
[702.36] Now, should I give it in writing?
[706.16] Fine, I will give it in writing. 
Enough.
[711.12] Enough. It is enough.
[714.08] Now, not another word.
[731.40] We trusted your decency
[734.32] and married our daughter 
to your son, Brother.
[737.32] I am very embarrassed in front of you.
[741.80] Hey, why are you getting embarrassed?
[744.16] And whatever Sarfaraz said 
and went, is right.
[751.84] And madam,
[753.48] we too said yes to the marriage 
seeing your decency.
[760.36] But what happened?
[761.48] Your daughter ran away on 
the first night of the wedding.
[764.48] Now if one sister turns out to be like this,
[766.36] fingers will be raised on the other sister.
[768.52] Did you see?
[770.44] Did you see it?
[772.52] This is why you brought me here, forcefully,
[775.76] so, that they ruin the little respect 
that I have left.
[779.20] Brother Aslam,
[780.64] look, I will talk to Sarfaraz.
[784.00] I will make him understand.
[785.12] Hey, leave it Mr. Naseer.
[787.64] I have seen how much control 
you have over your son.
[790.32] You will talk to him?
[830.96] If something has already been settled,
[833.48] what's the point of repeating the same 
thing over and over again by calling him?
[837.40] By marrying into such people,
[839.36] the peace of my son's life 
has been utterly ruined.
[845.40] You called?
[847.28] Yes, I have called you.
[849.00] When I have told you 
what you want will not happen
[853.64] then what is the point of repeating 
the same thing in front of everyone?
[857.44] I have told you my decision 
and my decision is final.
[866.72] I cannot believe it.
[868.76] I cannot believe that a man with such 
a cheap mentality can be my son.
[874.24] Yes, then don’t believe it.
[877.24] Stop your nonsense.
[880.04] This marriage will only work 
when she listens to me.
[885.92] Hey, why don’t you agree to what he says?
[893.08] What do you want to achieve by 
making both father and son, fight?
[896.64] What do you want?
[901.40] Instead of supporting his wrong actions,
[904.48] you should make him understand,
[905.64] so that he gets rid of the madness 
that has filled his mind.
[909.80] I have told you my decision
[911.60] and it would be better that 
you don’t interfere in my matter, or else…
[914.36] Or else?
[916.28] Or else what will you do?
[920.08] Or else I will leave this home and go forever.
[922.52] Leave.
[928.52] Leave right now and don’t come back.
[934.40] What are you saying?
[936.12] Why are you standing?
[937.40] What are you waiting for? Leave.
[941.80] Why have you become 
the enemy of your son?
[944.00] And you.
[945.44] you…
[946.28] what do you want?
[947.92] Are you happy causing strife 
between father and son?
[950.40] Has it cooled your heart?
[958.48] I am leaving.
[959.64] Brother.
[960.60] Sarfaraz. 
Brother.
[962.04] Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz,
[964.40] I will not let you leave the home and go. 
For God’s sake, don’t go.
[966.44] Whatever is happening with me, 
is because of you.
[968.44] Leave me.
[972.12] Sister-in-law.
[975.20] Sister-in-law.
[976.12] Sister-in-law. Mama.
[978.40] Sister-in-law. Papa.
[980.44] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. 
Sister-in-law, open your eyes.
[982.92] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. 
Hey, what new drama did she start now?
[986.08] Mama. Sister-in-law fainted.
[988.16] Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law.
[990.76] Child. Child, get up. 
Sister-in-law.
[992.84] Child you go call the ambulance.
[995.28] We will have to take her to the hospital.
[996.64] Wake up Sister-in-law. 
Sister-in-law.
[998.72] Child, that…
[1046.84] If something happens to Fiza,
[1049.12] I will not leave your son.
[1051.08] Who are you calling?
[1052.52] I am calling Fiza’s father, 
I have to tell him the entire situation.
[1056.40] And if this becomes a police case,
[1058.48] then you can keep on trying 
to save your son.
[1060.36] Where is Sarfaraz? Call him.
[1063.20] If something happens to her, 
we'll have to face the consequences.
[1066.16] It's necessary for him to be here.
[1067.96] Come on. Come on. Hurry up.
[1069.44] Hurry up. Sit in the car. Come on.
[1071.20] You too come. 
You too come. Be quick.
[1073.16] Be quick. Sit in the car.
[1077.80] Come on. Come on. Sit.
[1103.00] Hello.
[1104.32] You disappeared after taking the price.
[1107.20] Had I disappeared, 
how would I have answered the phone?
[1111.12] What is the update on my work?
[1113.32] It cannot be done.
[1114.48] What do you mean it cannot be done?
[1116.04] You took a price for this work.
[1118.28] I have taken a price,
[1121.04] I had also started throwing my cards.
[1123.96] But Ghaznavi turned the tables on me
at the last moment.
[1130.32] Nosherwan?
[1132.92] How did he find out?
[1134.48] You have stayed so close to him 
and you still don’t know him till today?
[1140.08] He has ordered me 
to leave this city and go.
[1144.80] And if I don’t do this,
[1147.72] I can also lose my life.
[1150.12] And what will happen to my work?
I don’t know.
[1153.44] But, I cannot do your work risking my life.
[1157.56] Deceiving me can cost you a lot.
[1161.20] Right now, Ghaznavi has only found out
[1165.20] that I threatened Dua.
[1168.32] When he finds out
[1170.56] that you gave me the money for this work,
[1174.80] then think,
[1176.12] what will he do to you?
[1178.92] You won't even be left capable 
to call and threaten me.
[1183.96] Don’t you dare try to threaten me again?
[1188.24] What if, I am forced to take your name 
in front of Ghanzavi?
[1203.88] Nosherwan
[1207.32] is acting like Dua’s shield.
[1217.56] Hey,
[1219.16] what did you do? Huh?
[1222.52] She is in the emergency ward.
[1223.80] Hey, what happened as soon as we left,
that she reached the hospital?
[1226.32] What happened to Fiza?
[1227.64] She fell herself
[1230.12] and why are you questioning us like this?
[1233.40] Look, Aslam, pray for Fiza.
[1240.28] Greetings.
[1241.44] Doctor, how is my daughter-in-law, now?
[1244.76] The patient is really unwell
[1247.48] and the sad thing is that 
the child is no more.
[1266.16] Where is her husband?
[1271.12] There. He is here.
[1278.92] Okay, so he is her husband.
[1283.24] You are the same one 
who didn’t want the child, right?
[1294.48] Congratulations, 
your plan is a success.
[1300.72] You had wished
[1303.04] that if not this way,
[1304.68] then something should happen 
to that child that way.
[1311.56] What are you saying?
[1313.48] You ask your son.
[1315.60] He didn’t want the child 
to come to this world.
[1320.16] Even right now, 
I am not sure
[1321.96] if Fiza fell herself or if someone pushed her.
[1333.28] Anyway, when Fiza regains consciousness,
 we will take her statement.
[1337.32] We will make a decision after that.
[1339.68] Pray for her.
[1343.20] Hey, you tried to kill my daughter.
[1345.56] Hey…
I will kill you.
[1347.40] What are you doing?
I will kill you.
[1350.24] What are you doing?
What are you doing?
[1352.56] He didn’t stay at home after you left.
[1355.56] How can you blame him for everything?
[1357.76] I know everything.
[1359.16] My daughter is in this condition 
because of you. Because of you.
[1361.92] Hey, fine, he is responsible.
[1364.96] But, this is a hospital. 
Show patience.
[1368.24] What are you saying? Huh?
[1370.88] Instead of supporting your son,
 you are taking their side?
[1374.36] Their side?
Hey, you be quiet.
[1376.80] Let Fiza make her statement once,
[1378.76] I will not leave you.
[1380.28] Who are you threatening? 
Tell me, who are you threatening?
[1382.96] If my son is not saying anything,
[1384.80] then does this mean 
you get on my head? Huh?
[1388.00] You come on. 
You come from here.
[1390.04] I have to talk to you. Come on.
[1392.32] I will see you.
[1394.20] And why are you crying? Be quiet.
[1397.28] It is a hospital. It is a hospital.
[1400.08] Come here. 
Come here.
[1401.96] What did you do?
[1403.48] What did I do?
[1404.76] Hey, how did she fall?
[1406.76] How would I know? 
I left from there.
[1408.84] I don’t know what you people 
are blaming me for.
[1410.96] Once you left, 
she fell and lost her child.
[1414.04] Even your father-in-law and mother-in-law
 know that you didn’t want this child.
[1416.72] On top of that,
[1418.56] even the doctor has recognized you.
[1421.00] Now, if Fiza regains consciousness,
[1423.84] and says something inappropriate, 
then what will we do?
[1426.80] I don’t understand the need 
to come to this hospital.
[1429.68] If that doctor says something, 
then we will be in trouble.
[1431.96] Hey, when does your father listen to me?
[1434.44] He brought her here.
[1436.68] Now see, what you wanted has happened.
[1440.48] This child is no more.
But what next?
[1443.80] Think, what will we do next?
[1445.92] This is a police case.
[1447.48] Even I don’t understand anything.
[1449.40] Now everything is in Fiza’s hand.
[1451.72] If she wants,
[1453.36] she can send you to jail,
[1455.24] or she can set you free.
[1456.96] Mama, hear one thing carefully.
[1459.60] If she speaks any nonsense against me,
[1462.04] then I will divorce her and go.
[1464.84] Hey cool down. Cool down.
[1466.76] Because of your anger, we've reached a 
point where there's a police case against us.
[1471.88] What should I do?
[1474.08] I will have to do something.
[1503.16] Fiza, my child.
[1521.36] Mama.
[1525.04] My child is fine, right?
[1527.40] Did you ask the doctor?
[1530.12] My child is absolutely fine, right, mama?
[1533.72] Fiza,
[1536.88] your child is no more.
[1543.64] What are you saying? 
This is not possible.
[1546.84] My child cannot be separated from me.
[1549.92] You are lying, mama.
[1551.68] Mama, don’t lie to me at all.
[1553.60] Ask the doctor. Call the doctor,
[1555.28] I will ask them. Why are you saying this?
[1556.92] Child,
[1559.12] come to your senses. 
This is the truth.
[1561.40] I am not asking you. 
I am telling you, call the doctor,
[1564.08] I will ask them. 
They must know.
[1565.48] What do you know right now? 
You know nothing.
[1568.04] Child, this is true.
[1570.48] This is what God willed.
[1573.96] Accept God’s will.
[1576.76] It is true, your child is no more.
[1582.44] Mama.
[1584.48] Mama, my child.
[1592.48] Mama.
[1595.76] Mama.
[1604.00] No. Mama. No. Mama, no.
[1615.64] Is it done?
[1618.00] Can I go now?
[1621.04] I would have liked it had you come along.
[1624.40] I came from outside, 
I am a little tired.
[1628.08] That’s why I am not insisting either.
[1631.12] Had it not been necessary then 
maybe I too wouldn’t have gone.
[1633.64] Uh-huh.
[1635.48] Such business dinners are important.
[1638.12] You should go.
[1640.28] Hmmm.
[1641.20] Have food on time.
[1647.52] You too.
[1667.88] Are you feeling okay?
[1670.88] I mean, I think you are unwell, 
so should we go to the doctor, first?
[1673.44] No. No. there is no need for that.
[1674.84] I am a little tired. 
I will be fine when I rest.
[1678.20] Okay, then you rest.
[1679.84] You go without worrying, 
I will rest.
[1683.32] Are you sure?
Hmmm.
[1686.00] I will be worried for you.
[1710.60] Fiza, child,
[1713.56] I know this sorrow is huge for you.
[1720.84] But believe me,
[1723.08] this is as big for us.
[1727.56] This was the first happiness of our home.
[1731.08] That’s it, child.
[1732.68] Have patience.
[1734.96] My child.
[1737.84] And yes,
[1740.84] I admit
[1743.36] that Sarfaraz is extremely 
short-tempered, child,
[1747.60] but look at him.
[1752.36] Since he heard the news 
of the child departing,
[1759.32] he is shattered by this sorrow.
[1772.08] Child, for God’s sake,
[1775.64] forget everything.
[1779.28] Don’t take it to your heart, child.
[1781.68] Forgive him.
[1785.48] Please, you people come out.
[1786.88] The police are here, they will take 
the statement of the patient.
[1789.28] Yes, child. Whatever there is,
[1791.92] tell it to them honestly.
[1799.88] Tell them
[1801.40] how eagerly we were awaiting that child.
[1807.64] We used to keep you with so much love.
[1811.64] How much we cared for you, right?
[1823.32] Come on, you people come out, please.
[1826.88] Okay, tell them the truth.
[1899.28] This is the third time 
you have called in such little time.
[1902.48] Because I am worried for you.
[1905.00] I felt that you were not fine.
[1907.52] I am fine.
[1911.32] You tell me,
[1913.28] how do I make you believe?
[1915.84] When you are fine,
[1917.80] then I get the vibes myself,
[1920.16] and I am not getting them right now.
[1923.52] The party too is really boring. 
I am leaving from here.
[1928.52] Fine, come on.
[1930.88] When you are in front of me, 
you will believe me, right?
[1948.84] You, be ready. 
We will go somewhere.
[1952.68] Right now?
[1954.00] Yes, right now.
[1958.84] When you are with me,
[1961.04] I lose track of time.
[1967.60] Fine.
