[24.68] Stop your advancing steps Nosherwan.
[27.08] No, mom.
[29.44] You know...
[32.08] ...I don’t look back once
I make a decision.
[36.80] You’re going against
our decision Nosherwan,
[40.88] do you know the outcome
of coming to blows with us?
[43.80] You know very well what we can do.
[49.12] I know Baba Saeein,
[53.00] I know it very well.
[60.08] I can compete with this world
but not with you,
[64.76] I don’t want to fight you.
[74.76] All I’m going to say is...
[79.40] ...you took Farah away from me...
[86.52] ...don’t take this away as well.
[94.32] Otherwise, I won’t be able to survive this time.
[101.96] You people have taken my happiness
away from me before this as well,
[107.04] I only have one heart.
[110.64] I can’t keep on sacrificing it.
[125.96] Can I go?
[145.48] Goodbye.
[155.64] What is my fault?
[161.88] There’s no fault of yours,
[165.28] that’s why I’ve talked to Mom and Dad,
[169.76] if you want freedom let me know
and I’ll give it to you.
[172.84] Is she very beautiful?
[184.32] She is my love.
[203.28] Saeein,
[209.64] we kept thinking of him as unaware
and he kept thinking of us as cruel.
[218.00] After all, we also broke his heart,
[222.76] we can’t repeatedly leave his heart desolate.
[240.84] Stay with the person you show your loyalty to.
[248.76] Jaffar today is your driving test.
[271.32] Tell me, until when will you continue to have
me be humiliated by my own daughters?
[278.84] There’s no fault of Fiza in this.
[281.28] The poor girl herself was worried.
[283.16] Is it no fault of Fiza?
[284.48] She got her dad humiliated by her
husband and her mother-in-law
[288.28] and you’re saying that Fiza is not at fault.
[291.28] Mr. Aslam I was already refusing before,
you shouldn’t have called those people over.
[296.52] Why?
[297.08] Why shouldn’t I have called them over?
[298.72] My name comes after Fiza’s in her paternity.
[301.48] When my daughters step outside
all the fingers will be pointed at me.
[306.80] She’ll probably get an earful by
her in-laws because of you, she’s newlywed.
[313.80] And the disrespect she showed to her father,
you’re not even considering that.
[319.24] We’re the daughter’s side of the family,
why don’t you understand that Mr. Aslam?
[323.12] That’s your fault as well,
you gave birth to daughters.
[326.68] The mother isn’t the deciding
factor of the child’s genes Mr. Aslam,
[330.60] how long will you blame me?
[333.88] Hey, don’t cry, don’t cry.
[336.20] However, it happens I’ll bear it on my heart,
even though it’s not something bearable.
[340.84] Tell your daughter to not
come to our house anymore,
[344.48] she should stay where she is,
in her house.
[348.64] I can’t tolerate these continuous dramas.
[353.20] Tell her that we’re dead to her.
[361.84] Who knows what consequences
that poor girl must be enduring?
[364.96] Mom.
[371.76] Get a hold of yourself.
[397.32] Listen to me,
[399.96] why did your father invite us
there to humiliate us?
[404.64] I don’t…
[405.96] I… I really didn’t know,
[409.40] I didn’t know that
that’s why dad called us there.
[412.84] Okay,
[414.40] so did he get a revelation or a dream
that you started working again?
[419.40] Sania studies in the same school,
[423.28] I met both of them when mom
came to drop her off in the morning.
[426.88] Okay, so now I understand that you’re the one
who told them that I forced you to get a job.
[431.52] Why would I say that?
[433.04] Don’t lie to me, don’t lie to me.
[435.76] What need do I have to lie Sarfaraz?
[438.28] There’s a need, there’s absolutely a need...
[441.48] ...because of the type of house you belong to.
[444.28] If girls run away from there
[446.08] or have a job before marriage,
[448.08] they have no problem with it
[450.52] but the second the in-laws asked to start
the same job again then they have a problem with it.
[456.48] What…
[457.64] What type of things are you saying?
[459.72] I’m completely right,
[462.16] I endured it today but
if your dad talks like that again
[466.64] then no one will be worse than me
[469.72] and then I’ll present myself in my own way
[473.00] and it won’t be good.
[495.40] Yes, I’m reaching, I’m reaching in 30 minutes,
yes, very kind of you, goodbye.
[502.76] I can’t wait any longer now,
I have to conduct another wedding
[506.32] and the wedding procession
is already ready there.
[508.68] Goodbye.
[554.76] Jaffar, give me your phone.
[557.88] Yes, sir.
[572.48] Drive faster.
[594.20] The pain of a broken heart is just as much.
[605.52] The cleric came to conduct
the wedding and left as well
[615.04] and the one who didn’t come was her groom.
[624.48] It seems like he got scared
of paying the asked price,
[630.32] and ran away.
[632.00] Ran away, hmm?
[637.16] By the way, you’re very innocent,
[639.80] stupid,
[643.40] you sat there believing
the words of that wealthy man.
[653.56] Do girls like you even make a home?
[662.52] They’re just an adornment
for someone’s arms,
[669.44] right?
[684.32] Dua!
[732.52] Will you ruin your
appearance before I’ve seen it?
[744.80] At least give me the right to see,
[755.76] that how your appearance
changed after becoming my bride.
[803.64] Should we start the wedding ceremony?
[805.16] Yes, start.
[808.84] Dua, daughter of Aslam your marriage will be fixed
with Nosherwan Ghaznavi, son of Hashmatullah,
[813.84] with a wedding gift of
50 million rupees at the current rate.
[817.80] Do you accept?
[824.32] Dua,
[825.72] answer.
[839.92] I accept.
[874.72] Nosherwan Ghaznavi, son of Hashmatullah,
[876.96] your marriage will be fixed with Dua,
daughter of Aslam,
[879.44] with a wedding gift of
50 million rupees at the current rate.
[882.64] Do you accept?
[885.76] I accept.
[948.28] One minute, one minute.
[952.24] Mr. Nosherwan Ghaznavi,
[956.24] you’ve forgotten everything
the moment you got Dua.
[966.68] Jaffar.
[967.88] Yes.
[972.44] Nosherwan Ghaznavi doesn’t forget neither
does he go back on his promises.
[978.96] Let’s go.
[1010.32] What happened, are you not happy?
[1015.40] I’m happy.
[1017.40] Then what’s the reason for this sadness?
[1022.20] That cheque.
[1025.96] You shouldn’t have given
Zunaira that blank cheque,
[1032.08] she’ll bring a lot of harm to you.
[1036.96] Let her.
[1041.76] Still, a blank cheque,
[1047.68] I feel very bad about it.
[1052.36] And if right now you talk about
anyone other than me that I won’t like it.
[1060.96] Yes.
[1063.36] I’m very happy today,
[1065.88] maybe you are as well,
[1070.28] look at me,
[1075.96] it’s my fault,
[1079.44] maybe I entered your life too late,
[1084.60] you had to go through so much.
[1089.24] Okay now please, don’t cry.
[1093.88] If you keep a friendship with tears while
I’m here then we’ll have a lot of fights.
[1102.48] I won’t cry.
[1107.20] I don’t care who was
and wasn’t in your life before me,
[1116.32] but there should be no space for anyone
else other than me in your life after today, hm?
[1125.88] Trust me as much as you trust yourself.
[1135.20] I,
[1137.40] I’ll never humiliate you.
[1141.20] That’s what I expect from you.
[1195.76] I’m marrying Dua
[1197.28] Kashmala is married to you,
[1199.68] she is present in this mansion as your wife.
[1203.32] Kashmala is our family’s daughter-in-law.
[1205.44] Could you only find that dirty girl
as her replacement, to bring into our family?
[1210.92] An accident took her there,
otherwise I know her,
[1214.20] she belongs to a simple,
respectable household.
[1218.80] There’s no fault of yours,
[1220.64] that’s why I’ve told Mom and Dad
if you want freedom let me know.
[1224.12] I’ll give it to you.
[1225.32] Is she very pretty?
[1227.48] She is my love.
[1285.84] Mizna,
[1287.52] eat your food child.
[1288.76] I don’t want to eat.
[1291.40] Uncle came and left
without even meeting us,
[1295.36] even though he knows we miss him
a lot he still left without meeting us.
[1302.08] Hmm
[1303.48] Uncle was in a hurry
that’s why he didn’t meet you.
[1306.72] Next time he comes,
[1308.32] he’ll come with a lot of spare time
and he’ll spend time with you.
[1312.16] You’re telling the truth, right grandmother?
[1314.16] Can I ever lie to my doll?
[1316.04] No.
[1320.52] Madam.
[1322.68] Pirah, I told you to call Kashmala for dinner.
[1326.88] She refused to come, she’s crying a lot.
[1335.92] Alright.
[1339.68] Why is mom crying?
[1342.56] Nothing child, eat your food.
[1346.32] Go check on her,
[1348.92] it’s a difficult time for the girl.
[1353.56] Yes,
[1355.28] make sure that the kids eat their food.
[1357.52] Yes
[1358.40] I’ll be back
Go.
[1361.24] Eat children, eat, eat, eat.
[1376.24] Is everything alright doctor?
[1377.68] Yes Mr. Ghaznavi, there’s nothing
to be worried about, she’s fine.
[1381.44] I’ve given her first aid
so she’ll wake up in a little while.
[1386.20] Yes, thank you!
[1388.28] Don’t worry, if you still need anything
then you can call me.
[1392.04] Sure, come on, please.
[1404.28] Who has this much courage?
[1406.88] An investigation is going on sir,
we’ll find out very soon.
[1412.12] I will punish that person so severely
that his coming generations will remember it.
[1418.24] Yes, sir.
[1440.84] Hello.
[1441.76] Greetings, madam.
[1443.80] Get to the point.
[1445.36] Madam, I tried my ha…
hardest but despite that the g…gi…
[1454.80] girl survive…survived madam.
[1456.32] She survived?
[1458.40] How did she survive?
[1462.60] I asked you to attack those people so that
that girl wouldn’t be able to survive.
[1474.76] She should’ve died before
entering Nosherwan’s life.
[1483.64] And you’re telling me
your tales of incompetence?
[1487.12] Madam, I went fully prepared madam
[1490.32] but younger sir’s men proved to be
so alert that all my men got killed.
[1497.04] I barely managed to escape
with my life madam.
[1502.44] Why didn’t you drown and
die before making this phone call?
[1513.48] A..Am…Amma Saeein I…
[1514.92] How dare you have the audacity,
[1524.52] the nerve that you took such a big step.
[1530.96] Until a few minutes ago,
[1533.96] we were concerned about you,
[1536.80] all our sympathies were with you,
[1541.84] I was coming to ask how you were feeling,
[1545.60] and you...
[1548.84] got so consumed by
your envy of his second wife
[1553.44] that you stooped so low as to incite
a deadly attack on Nosherwan and his bride.
[1559.24] Do you have any idea...
[1563.24] ...what would’ve happened to you
if anyone had lost their lives in that attack?
[1572.28] Something horrible will happen to you
[1575.72] when Nosherwan finds out that
you had him and Dua attacked.
[1584.08] So Amma Saeein, no,
what else could I have done?
[1589.16] What else could I have done?
[1591.88] You people gave Nosherwan
permission to get married again…
[1595.60] So!
[1597.20] So, this is the method you found?
[1602.16] You’ve forgotten all
the favors of our son, right?
[1607.20] Someone who didn’t leave you
to face the difficulties of life,
[1612.44] or leave to face all types of setbacks,
[1615.48] accepted you in his marriage,
[1618.64] and never let your children
feel Zawar’s absence.
[1626.00] And what did I get from
that Amma Saeein, huh?
[1630.68] My heart is still as desolate,
still as barren, what did I get from that?
[1638.16] You’re very ungrateful,
[1641.84] very forgetful of kindness.
[1647.08] Nosherwan broke his heart
to fill your life with happiness,
[1654.20] you reside in this mansion to this day
with all the rights of ownership.
[1661.76] And you,
[1665.40] you tried to devastate that
same Nosherwan’s heart and life?
[1672.20] You should be ashamed.
[1674.64] Wow Amma Saeein,
[1676.16] wow,
[1678.68] look how worried you are about
your son’s heart being broken
[1684.56] and you forget that I’m a human too,
[1688.52] I also have a heart,
[1693.00] I accept that I made a mistake,
[1697.24] I will accept whatever punishment
I’m given for this mistake.
[1701.08] But answer one thing,
[1703.64] where should I go with
the restlessness inside me?
[1707.80] Tell me, where should I go?
[1715.28] Amma Saaein.
[1732.80] Why did she survive,
[1737.44] why did she survive?
[1747.36] Yes Jaffar, what happened?
[1748.64] Uh, It’s Amma Saaein calling.
[1752.48] Greetings mom.
[1754.20] Greetings son, stay blessed.
[1756.96] Nosherwan, ever since I’ve heard of
the attack on you my heart has become very worried.
[1761.00] I’m completely fine,
[1763.88] this means that you’ve found out.
[1767.00] What do you think,
[1769.12] that we stay unaware of
what goes on with you?
[1771.40] No, Mom, I know you get
every news regarding me.
[1778.52] How are you?
[1780.24] I’m perfectly fine,
[1782.08] don’t worry at all.
[1785.72] And that girl?
[1790.24] Your daughter-in-law.
[1797.48] So, you’ve married her?
[1801.24] Yes.
[1804.08] Take care of yourself
and of our daughter-in-law.
[1812.44] Definitely.
[1815.28] Greetings.
[1851.40] Ghaznavi.
[1852.44] Relax, I’m with you,
[1856.88] keep lying down, you need the rest.
[1863.04] Are you alright?
[1865.44] I’m perfectly fine,
[1869.04] you nearly ended my life
by falling unconscious.
[1874.00] It was a brutal attack,
[1877.04] shots were being fired,
[1879.88] are you really alright?
[1882.40] I’m in front of you,
[1887.16] I’ve survived a lot of times
before this in attacks as well
[1891.88] but believe me
[1894.92] I’ve never been as happy
about that as I am today.
[1902.24] If I’d lost my life in this attack
[1907.04] then how would I have seen
how you are agonising for me?
[1911.24] God forbid something happens to you,
[1915.56] who were those people?
[1921.60] Enemies?
[1924.16] Enemies?
[1926.80] But who could be your enemy,
[1931.56] you’re so good.
[1934.76] Good?
[1938.48] Maybe you think
I’m good but not my enemies.
[1944.60] I’ll tell you this much that
I have more enemies than I have friends.
[1950.80] Why?
[1955.96] You’ve just came in to my life,
[1958.72] I’ll tell you everything slowly and gradually,
[1962.16] currently I’m worried about you,
I’ll order something to eat.
[1965.40] Listen,
[1968.36] don’t go anywhere, please.
[1974.92] I’m not going anywhere.
