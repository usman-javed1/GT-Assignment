Hello. Hello, Rumi, how are you? Leave me, you tell me, are you fine? Thank God. You sound worried, 
is everything okay? Man, I am really worried. Thank God I got through on your number. I was worried all night long about whether 
I would be able to talk to you or not. Why the emergency?
Is everything okay? Everything is fine in this ordeal. Anyway, you answer me. Yes, yes, go ahead. Did Zunaira contact you? Yes. When? A few days back. What was she saying? The same that is in her nature, what else? Did you talk to Nosherwan about this? No, I don’t think so. 
I didn’t tell him anything. I don’t find it to be right. Then, I don’t take what Zunaira 
says seriously, either. Man, Dua, this negligence of yours can 
become a big problem for you one day. What do you mean? Meaning, Zunaira was talking to someone
on a call about bringing you back here. And you know what? She also took a big sum of money for it. She took money? Yes, and her calling you also 
indicates the same thing. Who did she make a deal with? I don’t know anything. I just heard her talking 
to someone on the phone. She didn’t take that person’s 
name even once, so, I don’t know who called. Okay… Dua, I am really worried for you. You… You don’t worry because of me. I feel you should tell Nosherwan
 everything about this. I will think about it. You… you just take care and find out and tell me 
who she made a deal with. Yes, I will find out, but you take 
a lot of care of yourself. I don’t know what game 
Zunaira wants to play this time. You relax, I will see everything. Okay? Okay, bye. If he finds out what you did with Mr. Sarkar. He is a man. Who's going to convince him that you are still a pure girl? I will meet you really soon after 
fulfilling all the legal requirements. I will wait. I will take my leave now. Bye. Bye. Greetings Baba Saeein. 
Greetings. Live long. Live long. How are you feeling? Thank God. Thank God. 
I am better. What legal requirements 
were you talking about? Has there been any dispute 
over the land? You are here, Nosherwan. 
Greetings, mama. Greetings. Live long. Sit. 
Sit. Yes? I had called the lawyer 
to get my will written. Baba, may God give you a long life. What is the need of the will? There was a need, that’s why I did it. Baba Saeein, that’s what I am asking
what is the need? Zawar is no longer with us. You've become a city dweller. After me, the women of the mansion 
will be left alone. I had to think about them too. Then there are Zawar's belongings. we have to think about them too. You should surely think about it. After Brother Zawar, whatever remains
 belongs to his children. But wealth can never replace a person. You are right. But you can't deny the importance 
of wealth either, can you? After me, your Amma Saeein will handle 
all the matters of this mansion. May God protect you, 
and may He give you a long life. Why are you saying these things? You have to go when the call comes. Baba Saeein, don’t say these things. Everyone is so worried about
you over just a little illness. I'm sure the kids must be 
very anxious seeing you like this. I am worried about them. Why don’t you take Kashmala 
and the children along with you? No, Baba Saeein, then how will you two live alone over here? And I think they will not be 
able to adjust there. Kashmala and the children 
are your responsibility. Yes, I understand that 
they are my responsibility. When I came last time, I gave a suggestion,
what happened to it? I had tried to talk, but she is not ready to 
hear anything in this matter. We cannot force her, right? Once you get better, we will talk about all this. 
Leave it right now. You married that girl informing her 
that you have a wife and children. Yes, Baba Saeein, I had told her the condition under which 
I accepted this relationship. Then what is the difficulty? There is no difficulty, Baba Saeein. Right now, your health is more important. And if things aren't improving
 with the doctors here, come with me. 
I'll get your checkup done in the city. Please take care of your health. We will talk about all this some other time. You only live as much as life allows, right? You just don’t be negligent about here. That’s why I sent you a message and called you here so that I advise you. I don’t know why you are saying 
these things that stir up the heart. You will be fine. May God give you a long life, 
and may He give you health. How are you?
Absolutely fine. Live long. Since I heard this good news, 
I couldn’t resist and I came. Congratulations sister. Hey. Greetings. 
Greetings. These sweets? Did your daughter’s wedding get fixed? No, sister. The match wasn't suitable, 
the boy was too old. Yes, every daughter of yours cannot 
have a fate like our Fiza, who found both a good home and a good husband. You people, sit. I will bring tea. Sania, let’s make tea, 
we will also talk. Come on. Come. Sit. You too sit. Sit. Sit. Now you need to rest more. As soon as brother told 
this good news to Fiza’s father, I couldn’t hold myself, 
I came running. What? Naseer gave you this news? Yes, should he not have given us this news? The decision of the fate of this child 
has still not been made, and Mr. Naseer has started telling the world. What? What do you mean? What decision? How are you, son? Sister Kausar, you were saying something? I didn’t understand you. Look, it is clear. After your daughter ran away from home, the character of both your daughters
 will be questioned. What question? If the good news comes 
in the home so soon, then the man will have a doubt in his heart. And at the time, when both of them are not even
 on good terms, either. Look sister, this is in the hands of God. Human will doesn't have much say in it. You are saying this, but if a man gets doubt in his heart once, then who can take it out? That’s why, Sarfaraz is not 
in favor of this child. Uncle, you are leaving so soon. I will not let you go so soon. Child, I will come back. Maazra is absolutely right, we will not let you go anywhere, uncle. Children, let uncle leave. Someone is waiting for him there. Who is waiting, uncle? The one who is more dearer to him 
than me and you, and everyone else. Such conversations are not 
appropriate in front of children. And what you have done, by bringing her between you and me? We had nothing between us, that you have such a problem 
with her coming in between. You called and saw for yourself. What did you gain? You two are playing 
the game of gain and loss. The one you married and 
brought home happily. Our fate? We are like incense sticks burned as needed, and in the end, we'll turn to ashes. We too will go with you, uncle. 
Yes, we too will go. No children, don’t insist. But, why?
Nosherwan, don’t worry. They are children, 
they are just like their mother, they will insist for a while, 
then they will cry and become quiet. You go without worrying, 
I will make them understand. I will wait for you Nosherwan, that maybe if you realize your 
mistake and you return back. Take care of yourself, children. You too. Go. Go to the room you two. Go. How can Sarfaraz raise 
a finger at Fiza’s character? You people should make him understand. Do you think I wouldn’t have tried making 
Sarfaraz understand? For the first time in this home, both father and son argued a lot, 
because of your daughter. Naseer dragged Sarfaraz out of the home, and Sarfaraz too, my child, left the home in his anger. I called Sarfaraz and pleaded 
with him to come back home, then he came back home. You people couldn’t control your daughters, so now what do you want? Should my son also get out of hand? We don’t want this at all. But, what you have said has worried me. Hey, we are the ones 
who have gotten worried. We got trapped forming a 
relationship with you people. Sarfaraz fears Naseer or else he would have left 
your daughter a long time back. Man, Dua, this negligence of yours can 
become a big problem for you one day. What do you mean? Meaning, Zunaira was talking to someone 
on a call about bringing you back here. And you know what? She also took a big sum of money for it. Dua, I am really worried for you. I feel you should tell Nosherwan 
everything about this. I don’t know what game 
Zunaira wants to play this time. Madam. Is sir back? No, sir still hasn’t come yet. Did he call? No, he hasn’t called either. Fine, when he comes, inform me. Yes, sure. Should I make tea for you? No, thank you. I will make it myself. Sure. Why did you call again? I had to call you to find out your answer. Look, Zunaira, on whosoever’s instructions 
you are playing this game will, it will cost you a lot. It will cost you a lot if you don’t agree with me 
and go to Mr. Sarkar. If you say anything for me from your tongue, 
then it will not be good. What will you do? Will you tell Ghaznavi? Yes, I will tell him. Tell him. What I do after that, you two won't even be able to face anyone. I am not going to get scared
 of these threats of yours. Hmmm… threat? Keep up this courage,
 it will be very useful. When Ghaznavi sees your video and takes you out of his life 
by divorcing you, himself, then you will understand 
what I am saying. What video? I have the entire video of the night
 you went to meet your lover, and I will make it viral 
if you don’t agree with me and you don’t go to meet Mr. Sarkar. Then I will see how Ghaznavi keeps you with himself. What did you think? You will get saved from me so easily? Now the decision is in your hands, will you go to meet Mr. Sarkar, or should I make your video viral? I… I was going to tell you. 
Relax. You don’t need to be worried 
about anyone, with me around. Especially don’t worry about people like her, I am here. I am going for something important, I will be back in a little while. Don’t worry. You've been enduring so much alone, without even telling us what you're going through. What would I tell you? They are demanding me to prove 
the purity of my character. Mama, we have always lived a clean life,
 despite that, today, fingers are being raised at my character. I don’t understand what words I find, using which I can prove myself 
to have a pure character. I don’t understand. I couldn’t even imagine that Sarfaraz 
and sister Kausar would say such things. Mama, people's understanding often 
surpasses our expectations. And as for their tongues? They have no limits. What will happen? Sarfaraz has told me that if I don’t get rid of this child, he will divorce me. So, child, will you kill… No. Never. Even if Sarfaraz divorces me, 
and leaves me, I will never harm my child. These people are not worthy of you, sister. You should come along with us. You don’t change homes out of fear. I will have to live here. I will stay here and fight the battle for my child’s life. How will you do all this, my child? Sarfaraz is against it. I will have to do it, or else, I will lose my child. And what answer will I give 
on the Day of Judgment then? When we won't be there… What is the matter? 
You look really happy. Yes, I am really happy. Also tell me the reason for this happiness so I too get happy. Yes, by the way, this news will make you happier than me. How is that? Your beloved, dear friend is coming back. Dear friend?
Yes. Dua. Dua? Why would she come back here? Nosherwan took her from here
with great respect. You had received a proper price for Dua. Yes, he took her with a lot of respect, 
paying the price. But I have understood one thing she is a hen that lays gold eggs. If I am getting a higher price for her, 
then why should I say no? Price? What price? And why do you think that 
Nosherwan will leave Dua, easily? What do you think? I am unaware of girls like you and Dua. If we don’t have a weakness for the one, we want to keep in captivity, then won't our business shut down? What weakness of Dua do you have? I have one. Will you also hide it from me? How will I reach her weakness, 
even after knowing the truth? You know, I am loyal to you. The video of that room, where Dua went to meet 
her lover for the first time. This is such a weakness, that when it gets viral, Ghaznavi’s love will turn to ashes. And he will not even take 
a minute to leave Dua. You are mistaken. What is all this? You are packing all your belongings and going away from this city, 
right now, this very moment. On whose orders? My order. This cannot happen. What hooliganism is this? Should I call the police? Shamsher, guards, 
where have they all gone? No one will come. Everyone is outside nursing their bones. Video? What video? Don’t waste time in useless talk, or you’ll lose your life. Where is the video? In the locker. Jaffar. Come on. Take me to the locker. Come on. Anything else? Everything is in this. You have two days. Leave from here. Because not just seeing your face, I wouldn’t even want to hear 
your voice after today. Try that I don’t see your shadow anywhere, or you won’t be spared. Mama and Sania had come to meet you. But you didn’t stay,
you didn’t meet them. Is it not enough that I am tolerating you? They are your in-laws. So? You give a little importance 
to the guests who come home, especially if they are so close. Fiza, what is your problem? Huh? I mean, what do you want from me? 
Why do you get after my life? I... I am trying to make you 
understand something, this time. No, you will make me 
understand now? Huh? You have become really sensible? Lower your voice. Please, if someone hears you 
what will they think? Why should I lower my voice? It is my home. Let whoever understand 
whatever they want to understand. And you need to understand one thing, if you have no worth in front of me, then what will be their worth? Sarfaraz, they are my own. They have been hurt a lot by your behavior. Yes, so I have not taken up the responsibility
 to keep everyone happy over here. And understand one thing. Leave your teacher attitude at school, don’t bring it to this home. No need to order me around. I know well what I need to do 
and what I don’t need to do. I was going to tell you. Relax. You don’t need to be worried 
about anyone, with me around. Especially don’t worry about people like her, I am here. I have the entire video of the night 
you went to meet your lover, and I will make it viral 
if you don’t agree with me and you don’t go to meet Mr. Sarkar.
