Okay, Fiza, child, tell me. Tell me, what is your will? Tell us whatever your will is. Tell us. Now, what difference will my will make? As much bad had to happen to me, it has happened. My child, what had to 
happen has happened. Now, look, listen to me, we will accept the decision you make. If you want to live with Sarfaraz… then live with him. If you want to make any other decision… make whatever decision you want,
I will do whatever you say. Tell me. I want a divorce from Sarfaraz. What point has life brought us to? We cannot even stop you 
from making this decision. Maybe, this is better for you. I don’t want to become a sinner
by stopping you further. Okay. Okay, child, you have made your decision, so I will hire a good lawyer. Don’t worry. Come on. We are with you, child. Don’t be scared. Thank you, Papa. Forgive me. Forgive me. Okay, so you want to remove 
Dua out of the way because you want to get Ghaznavi. You too want to get Dua. And not just Dua, but also all the wealth. Yes, that’s how it is, and when you know 
everything about me, then why are you asking? When the interests are the same, you must keep information 
about each other. Tell me, do you accept this deal? What will the percentage be? Whatever is in Dua’s share will be yours. You didn’t leave any room for refusal. Hey, Mr. Naseer, what happened? What is written in it? Tell me. This… Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz. Tell me, what is written? -What happened?
-Sarfaraz, see, your Papa is getting unwell.
God knows what is written in it. Okay. So, now they have the courage that 
they will send me a notice for separation? What do you mean? Fiza wants to separate from me. Oh God. They are such shameless people. They have no modesty in them. 
Those people are so cheap. First, they tried to trap my son with 
one daughter and ruin his reputation, and then they deceitfully arranged 
his marriage with the other. No, you make them pay. You give them an answer. You divorce her. 
Only then will they understand. Hey, have shame. Hey, you have some shame. It is all your son’s doing. He is their sinner. He is a sinner. This is their decency that 
they secretly sent a notice for divorce, or else by principle, 
they should have sent the police. The police. You only see my son to be bad, everyone else is clean. Have some shame Kausar. 
Have some shame. We too have a daughter. She is married. If in the future Khizar divorces her, what will we go through?
Have you thought about it? Look. Look, 
I am telling you not to compare my daughter 
to those girls. My daughter is not immodest 
like those girls. Stop arguing with each other, first. We will stop arguing, but tell me, what do we do
about this damned notice? You will visit the court? Who will pay the fees of the lawyer? Yes, so why do we need to be worried? They have sent me a notice
of separation, right? I will go deal with them. Hey. Hey. Stop him. Kausar, stop him. Sarfaraz. What if he goes and does 
something wrong there? I will bring water for you. 
Get a grip on yourself. There is always some trouble 
that comes along. Oh, where will I go with this condition? Fiza, child, think about it. I have sent the notice, but still you have time.
Think about it. Papa, I have made this decision 
after thinking hard. I had never even thought that 
we would have to see this day too. Does anyone even think about 
such things, Fehmida? They just happen. Yes. Who is here, now? 
I will see. Papa, you sit.
I will check. Greetings. Fiza. Fiza. What do you think? You will send me a notice and
I will come here to apologize to you. I will fall at your feet? Here is your notice. And you did well that 
you sent me this notice. Because the truth is that 
I never wanted to marry you. I love you. Hey! Yes, Dua, I love you even today. Stop your nonsense. This is not nonsense, 
this is the truth. I love you just the same way 
you loved me, with all your heart. I even remember today how 
you used to secretly meet me. I have not forgotten anything. I have not forgotten anything. 
Hey, you haven’t stopped with your indecency. Won’t you stay quiet?
Get lost. And say whatever you want 
to say through your lawyer. Get lost from here. What is the need of a lawyer and judge, when we have to make the decision 
ourselves, over here? I have made my decision. Dua, the way you are my first love, 
I know…. Hey! I am your first love. And I am ready to do anything 
to make you mine. For that, even if I have to leave your sister,
then I will. Hey! That’s why, today, to make you mine, I divorce her. Get out. I divorce you. I divorce you. Get lost from here. 
Get out. Dua, I divorced your sister for you, today. Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Hey, what have you been up to? I have ended everything. What have you done? I divorced her. What? Hey, you will never be happy. You will never be happy. Hey, you treated such 
a good girl so badly. You were unjust to her. You will never find peace in your life. You will never find peace.
You will never find it. Are you his father or his enemy? You are cursing your son. He has not joked around and come. He divorced her and came. Have you ever thought what my son’s heart would 
have gone through? He is truly cursed.
Truly cursed. Just think about what that poor girl 
must have gone through. What her parents must be 
going through? He will never find happiness. I curse him! With the way he's acting, 
may God never accept anything from him. Fiza. Fiza, my child. 
Get a grip on yourself. Fiza, child. Hey, you, yourself, 
wanted to get a divorce, then why are you crying so badly, child? End this discussion here. Yes, I wanted a divorce. But today, Papa, he divorced me in front 
of everyone and left. It is all over. He used to threaten me all the time 
but he had never dared to do it. But today, he stood in your home and ended everything. 
Why? Did you people not see, how he was openly declaring 
his love for Dua? So, what did she do that today 
his love was talking so highly of her? Something has happened, right? From the night of the wedding until today, that man has given me 
so much sorrow, so much pain, that even 
my soul has been wounded. And today, I found out the reason 
for my destruction was no one else, but my own sister. Move back. Do you understand? 
Leave me. She is angry, child. What happened to her is bad. 
Don’t mind. What?
Who were you talking to? Who would I talk to alone 
in the room? The clothes had become wet,
I thought I would change. Dua, I heard with my ears 
you were talking to someone. Me… 
I was not talking to anyone. I was dancing so 
I was singing along with it. I locked the door, 
had Mama and Papa seen me, they would have scolded me, right? What will I do sitting here? I will do one thing, 
I will go back and then I will come back 
after two hours and take you. Where are you going? 
Are you mad? You know, if you go home alone right now,
then Papa will get really angry. I had such a hard time getting permission
to come to the parlor in the first place. Come on, just stay a little longer. Why do you need to go? Hey, our home is two streets away. I will go with some child, man. Now, see, it is better I go home and help Mama,
instead of sitting here. You know how Papa worries her. You have a sister, 
whose name is Dua and you are aware of her actions. She used to secretly 
talk to boys on the phone. Did you see the result of that? 
She ran away. No, Dua was not like that. Just once. 
Let me meet her once, -I will ask her myself why she…
-Don’t you dare, Fiza. You don’t even think about 
meeting her, understand? If you try to talk to her, then
I will divorce you on the spot. Because the truth is that 
I never wanted to marry you. Yes, Dua, I love you even today. I love you just the same way 
you loved me, with all your heart. I even remember today 
how you used to secretly meet me. I have not forgotten anything. I am ready to do anything 
to make you mine. For that, even if I have 
to leave your sister, then I will. That’s why, today, to make you mine,
I divorce her. Fiza. Fiza, why are you upset with me? There is no reality in whatever 
Sarfaraz said and went. All that was my stupidity. You did something stupid so easily. You sinned, then 
why am I getting punished? I never looked for secret doors like you. I never used to go 
and meet someone, secretly. I am really extremely embarrassed. But, I swear, I had never thought that 
you would get punished for my sin. You didn’t think about it? You didn’t think about it, right? But today, you’ve seen it all 
with your own eyes, haven’t you? Are your yearnings finally fulfilled? My loyalty, my love, my care, even my child, couldn’t stop Sarfaraz from divorcing me. Because he wants to be with you. He loves you and, you too love him. You are that girl, right? Huh? You are that girl who went on 
my wedding night to meet Sarfaraz. Speak up! You are that girl, right? Yes. Yes. I am that girl. Fiza, I swear, I am so sorry.
I am that girl, but whatever he said and 
went has no truth in it. Whatever he said was a lie. There is nothing like that. What will you suffer? You have put the punishment 
in my share. Huh? Listen to me once. You will understand everything.
 You will know everything. Hear me out once… I am not in the position to think 
or understand anything right now, okay? Not for me but leave for 
my child’s sake right now, please. Leave. Please. You… you are my sister, and seeing you like this 
is causing me so much pain. Please talk to me. 
Tell me what’s going on. I’m right here. I’m with you. 
I’ll listen to everything you have to say. I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything. You are the one. The pain in my heart 
increases seeing you. Leave from here. Why can you not go? 
Don’t you understand? Don’t you understand? 
For God’s sake, leave. What are you listening to?
Leave. Leave. This had to happen. I already had an idea that 
Sarfaraz could do something like this. I don’t know. But, I cannot see this condition of Fiza. I feel that I am responsible for all this. All this is happening with Fiza 
because of my stupidity. Dwelling in the past and blaming
yourself won’t do anything. You have not done anything. If Sarfaraz had even a little place 
for Fiza in his heart, then he would have never divorced her. He didn’t divorce her because of you. He is an indifferent person. He did this helplessly 
at the hands of his nature. But, along with divorcing Fiza, he has said really bad things to me. He portrayed in front of everyone that he was divorcing Fiza because of me. That he loves me even today. Although, there is nothing 
like that between us. Don’t even dare mention Dua’s name
on your lips, I’m warning you. Not just the name, everything about her 
is at my fingertips. Anyway, look, you came into her life right now, and fine, you impressed her with your money, but, I had nothing. Despite that, my name was on her lips. You? What are you doing here? I came to meet you. Why? The relationship we had with 
regard to Fiza has ended. Yes, that relationship is over, but I only ended that relationship, so that I can form a 
new relationship with you. What is the meaning of this nonsense? The meaning is clear, it’s obvious, that what I said yesterday is 
the same thing I’m saying today, that I love you, and I want to marry you. and if I married Fiza, then it was only because
I had pressure on me from people. I got scared that day,
I got misguided. But, I swear, I never wanted 
to cause you harm. If I even divorced Fiza,
it is because of you. and I want you to 
come back into my life. -If I divorced Fiza…
-Enough! If you say another word, 
I will break your face. Guards. Whatever I did, I did for you. -Dua, listen to me. 
-Take him away. Dua, look, this is not right.
I cannot live without you. Whatever I did was for you.
Don’t do this. Don’t take me out of your life.
I will face a big loss. Dua, listen to me… Wow, great performance, Sarfaraz. Now, no one can stop the watchman
and guard from testifying in front of Ghaznavi. My loyalty, my love, my care, even my child, couldn’t stop Sarfaraz
from divorcing me. Because he wants to be with you. He loves you and, you too love him.
