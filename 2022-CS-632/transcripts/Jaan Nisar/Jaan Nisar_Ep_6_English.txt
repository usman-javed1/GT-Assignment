What do you want? Should I stop coming to the mansion? If that’s what it is, then tell me, I will do it. How can you do this Nosherwan? If you do this, then I will tell everyone, that I am married to you, despite that 
you don’t give me my right. You have said this today, don’t say it ever again. Because you will even be 
deprived of this relation based on paper if you say 
something like that. Remember that. Nosherwan, I didn’t mean that. I was just saying that, what do I want from you? Your love and a little attention 
from you, that’s it. Nosherwan, how do I live like this? You come for a few days, 
then you leave. You think yourself, this is no life. Be grateful for what you have got. Even He doesn’t like ungratefulness. Our Fiza will go to her home 
after fifteen days. Congratulations. So soon? How did papa agree? They have said that 
we don’t know anything in the name of dowry, other than Fiza, then how could your father not agree? Hey, they are such good people, they even gave sweets and
 our Fiza is really pretty, right? There is no doubt in this, 
sister is actually really pretty. Come on, on this, have sweets. Yes. Yes. But how will we make 
preparations so soon? Hey, don’t scare me. I also have to make clothes. Meaning, the girl’s parents met and went, the relationship has been finalized. This means, brother is going to get married 
in ten to fifteen days. What did you think about Dua? That’s what I have to think about. 
Are you serious about her? What do you think? The way you went crazy seeing 
the first glimpse of her, you seem serious to me. Did you tell Dua? I didn’t tell her yet. If I tell her, she will get worried. Look, man, if you are serious for Dua, then tell your father not to get this wedding done. Man, let me talk to her first. Yes, that is also right. It is also necessary 
for her family to know. And yes, her father is really strict. If he says no, then, 
will you forget Dua? I can never forget her. You just arrived a few days back and you are already preparing to leave? There is some work in the city, it is necessary to go, Baba. The heart is not even satisfied 
looking at you, and you will disappear
from the sight again. I am not going forever, mama. I will come again. The children became 
happy seeing you. Now, if you leave, 
they will get sad. Now, you are both 
their uncle and father. Yes, I remember well. That is why I try that I am able 
to fulfill my responsibility well. You also a responsibility towards 
Kashmala too. Why do you forget that? Take Kashmala along. She goes around lost over here. It is like she has forgotten 
to laugh after Zawar. Baba Saeein, you asked me
 to get married, I did. Now please,
don’t force me further. She is your wife. How can I forget this reality, that snatched my love from me. Nosherwan, you live alone, doesn’t your heart feel anxious? When Kashmala and 
the children will be with you, then we too will be at peace. Amma, when am I at home. I leave in the morning and I don’t know 
where I will be in the evening. Please don’t put the responsibility 
of the children and Kashmala on me 
in such a situation. I have a hundred enemies in the city. You are here, 
Baba Saaein is here, so I am satisfied that 
they will be safe. But Nosherwan. 
Please, Baba Saaein, don't say things that 
I cannot accept, nor reject, and become 
disobedient to you. I called you so many times, you didn’t answer the phone. Sorry, man, papa’s friend’s father, passed away. I was in the funeral, so how could 
I answer the phone? But you should have told me. Hey, how could I tell you? You have told me not to call you. How could I call you, then? Yes, but you didn’t call, 
so God knows what sort of thoughts were 
coming to my heart. What were you thinking? Nothing. Just like that. You must be thinking that 
I am deceiving you. Hey, no. no. Don’t even think that, because your Faraz will 
never deceive you. I love you a lot. I don’t see anyone other than you. Really? Yes. I want to meet you. I am really 
restless to meet you. Shall we meet tomorrow?
Tomorrow? No. No. it is impossible tomorrow. 
Not at all. Then make the impossible, possible. We just met. Do you consider that fleeting 
moment a meeting? How will I meet you? Err… I…you know, 
if I get late from university, then mama and papa get really upset,
they scold me a lot. Yes, so I even have 
a solution for that. What we will do is that I will pick you up
 from university early in the morning, I will drop you back 
before the off time. This way, no one will find out that 
you were out with me all day long. So, long? What will you do for so long? Nothing. We will talk, we will go around, and I want to introduce you to mama. Mama? Why? Because they are talking about 
my marriage at home. I want that you meet mama once, so that they at least talk to papa. Okay. Give me some time to think. If you think so much, then I will get married 
to someone else. Oh, why do you say things 
that scare the heart? I told you, give me some time to think. Do you love me so much? You start losing your life hearing 
about my marriage with someone else. I love you a lot. We went to the market, but then we remembered, we don’t have the measurements 
for Fiza’s bangles and shoes. We came to get that. Yes. Yes. Why not? You did good. Go, child, bring juice for aunty… Yes, mama. What is the need for this? 
Leave the formalities. Hey, no, no, it is hot. Greetings. Greetings. Who is this? This is my daughter 
who is younger to Fiza. Okay. She is really pretty. Aunty, you didn’t tell us all 
your daughters are so pretty. You too are really pretty. Thank you. Where is our sister in law? Your sister in law is in the kitchen. Aunty, if you allow, 
then can I go to the kitchen? Child, what will you do 
in the kitchen inside, there is smoke and heat. 
Fiza will be here soon. No, no, there is nothing like that,
it is our own home. You go ahead. Come on, come. 
I will take you to the kitchen. Come on. 
Come. Why do you have to go so soon? Child, I will have to go back 
to come back. We didn’t even properly play 
any game till now. Okay, I promise, 
when I come next time, we will play a lot of games. Okay, uncle. I apologize for the interference, 
younger Saeein. But, the teacher of the children 
is waiting for them. Come on, children, 
the teacher is here. Come on. I can talk to you on call, right? Any time, child. Bye. Bye. Uncle. Bye. Bye. Have a good day. Bye. Bye. 
Go, study with your teacher. Why are you leaving so soon? You should have stayed a little longer. When I have to go, then what is 
going early and going later? But I want that you live here with me. Goodbye. Listen. You always leave me 
waiting every time. Don’t you feel pity on me? Are you reading a lot of
novels nowadays? Leave me, and focus on the home and children. Why are you standing here? 
Go outside, it is really hot here. There is no issue, 
it is fine here too. Okay, here, have cold juice. Thank you. Hey, go, serve it outside. Pick this up. You people also drink it. 
Yes, yes, we will drink it. You drink it. You know, I am really upset with you. Why with me? You people brought the groom’s 
picture that day, but you took it back without 
showing it to me. I am sorry. Actually, 
you were not there. But I will remove this complaint 
of your right now. How? I will show you pictures in the mobile. Oh yes, I didn’t think of this. I have some work, I will come. Hmm... He makes me click his pictures
 all the time. He is so handsome. 
He is also really photogenic. His pictures turn out to be so good. He is so good looking. 
I will show you. He looks like a hero. 
Really? Let me show you. This one? No, not this one. I will show you a good one. If he looks good, then 
he would look good, right? But a good picture is a good picture. Wait. Yes, this one. This one. My battery got low. 
My mobile switched off. Sorry. I will charge the phone 
and show you. Shall we go? Let’s go. Hello. Hello. You? I have such good luck. I was just thinking about you 
and you called. Let me talk to mama. Amma Saaein has gone 
to meet Shah Saeein. She wanted me to get 
something important. I was going to the mall, 
I thought I would call and ask. Okay, I will ask her and 
message you later. Okay, good. Okay listen, I too… Hello. Hello. Nosherwan. Maybe it got disconnected. I too wanted him to get something. I will message him. That’s it. That’s it. Stop here. Here you go, brother. Come on. Where have we come? You had said that it is Fiza’s 
wedding next week and you also wanted to 
get a new suit stitched. Yes, but I cannot afford 
shopping from here. Hey, we will not shop. We will just look at designer dresses, and then we will take pictures. 
You get it made for cheap. Have you gone mad? 
I don’t want to go. Hey, what is wrong?
Come on. Come. Hey, we will see. 
Like this, buddy… What is this, madam? Leave my hand. Leave her hand. 
Leave my hand. Hey, girl, how dare you raise your hand
at our squad? I have so much courage, that I can 
break the face of people like him. Stay in your limits, girl. You will 
have to be accountable for this. Someone will be held accountable, but not her… Sir, the gun touched her by mistake, this girl had slapped me. 
Whatever it was. Is this how you will talk to a girl? Apologize. 
Sorry, madam. Forgive me, 
they are all my guards, he collided with you by mistake. Whether it was a mistake 
or on purpose, he got punished. Yes, he got punished. You know, more than, them, 
it is the fault of people like you, who bring so many people 
as trouble for us. If you fear for your life so much, then hide in your grand 
palaces out of fear. Or if you're so fond, 
then fly in helicopters. But don't come down to us in helicopters
just to trouble common people. Look, talk with respect. You don’t know 
who you are talking to. I know well, I am talking to the boss 
of people like you. Dua, stop it. 
What are you doing? I am showing people like them 
their real face. Come from here. 
Come on. Come from here. Younger Saaein, 
she is a really arrogant girl. Next time, think carefully about 
who you're addressing. Sure. There should be no breaking news
 for this moment, and I want the footage 
for all these CCTV footage. Sure. And all the information of this girl. Greetings. Greetings. 
You are late again, today. What is this? This… how have you come? Where is your veil? It is in the bag. In the bag? Hey, the veil is not to keep 
in the bag, it is to wear. And if your father had seen you 
here instead of me, then all hell would have 
broken loose till now. Mama, have you ever thought about
anyone else other than papa? Huh? My BP was low, that’s why 
I removed it and put it in the bag. But, I should have thought about it,
 my mama doesn’t care about me, she only worries for papa. Next time, even if I suffocate,
I will not remove my veil. A person doesn’t step in the home, and you start investigating 
like a police officer. I have spent my life with your father. I know, that is why I talk like this. Saaein, she disappeared suddenly. We are unable to find out 
anything about her. Find out what home she lives in. What is going on here? Huh? Where have you people come from? Why are you entering here? Why? Let us do our work, you be quiet. I say, it is a neighborhood of 
decent people, get out of here. Leave. Come on. 
Come on, leave. Jaffar. He is an old man. Hey! Who did you call old? Your father is old. Understand? I can handle four young men
like you right now. You are arguing. 
Leave from here. Elder sir, I am caring for your age. Leave from here. 
Hey, don’t show aggression. 
Don’t show aggression. Come on. Come on. See, 
what is he doing. What is wrong, brother? 
What have you come here for? Hey, he is misbehaving with me. 
Enough! Quiet. Get out of here. He is the son of a Nawab. He must have come after a girl. He didn’t find the girl, he will kidnap someone’s daughter. I am telling you for the last time,
mind what you say. What will you do? Enough! Leave from here. 
Out! Leave! You people go. 
All of you leave as well. There is no show here. 
Please leave from here. Come on, Jaffar. Get lost. Come on. Leave. 
He is talking. Hey, come on, go. What happened? Papa had a fight 
with someone. Papa had a fight? 
With whom? I don’t know who they were. Hey sister, the boy was 
so handsome, you missed him. Just like a filmy hero. Really? Come inside, 
if papa sees you, he will make a film out of you. 
Heroine. Come on. Come. 
I am coming. Sir, the gun touched her by mistake, this girl had slapped me. 
Whatever it was. Is this how you will talk to a girl? Apologize. 
Sorry, madam. Forgive me, they are all my guards, he collided with you by mistake. Had I known I would get you hear 
your voice in response to my message, then I would have messaged
 a long time back. Really? What were you doing? Nothing. I was just missing you. I miss you too. And what were you doing? Nothing, I was just sitting. Meaning, you were missing me. Hmmm. Okay, listen. I had asked you for something. What? Hey, that meet me. Okay, I have told you, 
give me some time. Dua, I don’t have time. I just want to introduce you to mama, 
as soon as possible. I will think. Dua, you have already taken 
a lot of time. I cannot wait anymore. Why? Why is that? They are talking about 
my marriage at home. Hmmm. Even we have wedding 
preparations in our home. Huh? What do you mean they are 
preparing for your wedding? Hey, no, not my wedding. My elder sister’s wedding. I am a little busy at home 
preparing for it. Say that, you scared me. Really? If the idea of my marriage scared you, then what will happen if someone
 marries me off, tomorrow? I will never let this happen. 
I cannot even think. That’s it, that’s why I want that 
you meet mama as soon as possible. Okay, fine. Give me some time. That’s it. You have to 
meet mama this week and I want that you become 
part of my life, soon. You know, what the most beautiful moment
of my life will be? When I will raise your veil
with my hands. I will always keep you happy. Dua. Okay, I will put down the phone now. Yes, Saeein? I hope you have not returned 
empty handed. This has never happened that you order something and Jaffar 
returns empty-handed, Saeein. Hmmm... Her name is Dua, 
they are three sister, they don’t have a brother. She lives with her parents, 
she studies at the university, the father manages the counter
at a cloth shop. Their financial situation is not that good. The father is really strict. Some fiancé or relationship? There is none. Even if there was, why do you worry? By the way, it is her elder sister’s marriage next week. Okay, I can wait for this long. What, wait? I mean, you never took so much interest 
in any girl till today. Now, if I want to bring peace in my life, then why are you so surprised, Jaffar? No, I am not surprised. By the way, you look good smiling. Someone else has become 
the reason for my smiles. Saeein, I am a little worried. Kashmala has become really dull 
after Zawar’s departure. She has stopped laughing 
and smiling. Yes, even I realize this. But, not just Kashmala, even Nosherwan. I married both of them, that both of them will live 
happily all their life. We used to think that, after Zawar, if Nosherwan will 
stay in front of our eyes, then we will not miss Zawar. But after marriage, it is like 
the mansion pushes him away. He tries to run away from here 
on every other thing. I had even told you not to force him, but you didn’t listen to me at all. You have been really unjust to my son. Had Kashmala left this home, then the children and all of Zawar’s 
wealth would have left with her as well. I had no other option 
apart from Nosherwan. Had I not forced him, then 
what would I have done? Would I have let Nosherwan 
do what he wanted? His class fellow would never have 
been acceptable to us. That’s why, whatever I have done
is reasonable for my mansion. You got them married, but their hearts couldn’t be one. Even today, that girl is in
Nosherwan’s heart. He couldn’t take her one. Hmm. He doesn’t come to the mansion
for months. Saeein, find out, what if that girl is there and he got married to her 
and kept her in the city. No, no, I am well informed. He is not in touch with that girl. And after all, she got married to someone else, 
and a lot of time has passed since then. Okay, that’s good. Now, I pray to God that Nosherwan’s 
heart gets inclined towards the mansion. Hah, he is a man, no matter where he goes, he will return and come here. The day, the love of that girl leaves his heart, he will return here. Till today, he thinks that 
we were unaware of his love, and we made him sacrifice 
unknowingly. This is better. Because awareness brings 
nothing but pain. Is all okay? How can anything be okay 
without you? If there is something important, 
then tell me. You know I want some privacy
at this hour of the night. And how do I alleviate my loneliness? When are you alone? Bi Jaan, the children, Baba Saeein is there. I am the one who is alone. Nosherwan, you are alone by your will. You try calling out to me once. I will leave everything 
and come to you. You call out once. I know. Then, should I come to you? Huh? Right now, you rest, I will put the phone down. Nosherwan, you are really stonehearted. You are right, I have a stone in my chest, 
and not a heart. Years pass in trying to make 
a heart, a heart. Nosherwan, I will make this stone a heart 
with my love and affection.
