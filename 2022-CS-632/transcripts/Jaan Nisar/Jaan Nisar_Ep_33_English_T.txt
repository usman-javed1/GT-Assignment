[26.13] My mother and my sisters live here.
[29.67] Not once,
[30.97] I will come here repeatedly,
[34.87] and no one will have 
the courage to stop me.
[55.00] Have food.
[57.63] I am not hungry.
I will eat when I get hungry.
[60.60] Please stop now.
[61.93] End this anger.
[64.93] Have some food.
[66.57] Dua is your child.
[68.23] I did what I had to on your instructions.
[71.57] Your wish has been fulfilled.
[73.17] Now why are you 
standing here watching me?
[76.07] So, you too forgive her.
[82.03] So, she too finds peace 
and you do too.
[85.23] I have nothing for her.
[87.97] Not even forgiveness.
[89.63] Please don't harden your heart
so much towards her.
[93.77] Look Fehmida,
[96.03] it would be better to do your work.
[97.80] Understand?
[100.83] If I need to, I will eat
[103.07] if I get hungry then.
[104.80] So, why are you upset over food?
[106.73] Eat a little…
[108.23] Fehmida, take it away.
[130.23] Your daughter has become very arrogant.
[133.03] How she was threatening
in front of everyone
[135.80] that no one could stop
her from coming home.
[138.13] And listen,
[138.97] did you ask her
[140.87] where she ran away to?
[142.53] Listen to me.
[143.63] The daughter is mine,
[144.93] the problem is of my home,
[146.47] why do you have a problem?
[148.57] I am just talking,
[149.57] you are getting upset for no reason.
[153.77] I am your daughter,
[156.67] and you cannot even deny
this relationship after you die.
[178.03] Brother Niaz, I will pay you
a hundred rupees tomorrow, okay?
[183.20] Greetings.
[184.40] Greetings.
[185.43] You had to pay me money.
[186.97] Hey, man, I got a little late.
Take it next week.
[191.77] Why are you misbehaving?
[193.13] I am telling you, I will give it.
[194.20] You also told me last week
that you will give it.
[195.53] I will leave after taking the money today.
[196.80] You touched me again.
[198.17] I am telling you,
don’t touch me again and again…
[199.80] Don’t misbehave. 
I am asking you nicely…
[201.17] I told you not to touch me.
[202.83] What are you doing?
[203.97] Don’t misbehave Mr. Aslam.
What is the problem?
[205.07] What happened?
[206.00] Madam, he took a loan from me.
[207.03] I am asking him for it, 
and he is misbehaving.
[208.77] How much is the amount?
[209.60] Ten thousand.
[227.67] Come on, Papa.
[240.27] Come on.
[274.20] You left this love a long time back.
[277.33] Now, if someone
else has taken your place,
[281.00] then tolerate it.
[284.33] If I could tolerate it would
[286.63] I have taken such an extreme step?
[289.03] Listen, Farah,
[292.07] I have promised Dua, 
I will never cheat her.
[298.37] And I mean it.
[299.20] I will never cheat her.
[320.40] Madam, have food.
[322.63] When I have told you
that I don’t want to eat,
[325.23] then why do you bring
it again and again?
[327.03] Madam, Mr. Jaffar has strictly
told me to take care of you.
[333.67] Tell your Mr. Jaffar,
[335.03] not to worry about me, okay?
[337.03] You also have to go to
the hospital for your check-up as well.
[339.37] Mr. Jaffar had said that you be ready,
[341.60] he will come to take you to the hospital.
[344.13] Listen,
[346.20] am I a servant of your Mr. Jaffar,
[348.13] that I will do what he says?
[350.33] Mr. Jaffar…
[350.97] Tell Mr. Jaffar that
I don’t want to go anywhere
[353.67] and leave from here.
[354.87] But you are….
[355.67] Did you not hear what I said?
[357.63] Leave from here.
[359.00] Sure…
[359.57] And yes,
[360.43] don’t bring food here again
[362.87] or else you will see the worst in me.
[364.33] I will not even take two minutes
to drag you out of here.
[367.63] Leave!
[369.17] Yes, fine.
[407.80] I think it is Papa.
[413.87] Greetings.
[431.83] Greetings, Papa.
[448.67] Child, you don’t worry about him.
[459.13] Mama,
[461.00] when will Papa’s heart be
cleaned towards Sister?
[486.40] Go ahead.
[487.13] Sir,
[488.23] Madam is not eating
anything since yesterday.
[490.63] You must have not insisted.
[492.47] I did.
[493.73] But she is not listening to me.
[495.63] Instead, she is threatening to drag
me out of the home and job.
[499.00] She is not eating food, this means,
[503.00] she must not be taking her medicine either.
[504.57] Yes, absolutely.
[505.27] When I told her that you
were coming to take her to the hospital,
[508.07] she started getting upset further.
[509.63] She said I will not go anywhere.
[511.87] Hmm.
[513.97] Okay.
[514.57] Sir, I am really scared of madam’s anger.
[517.67] You do something, soon.
[519.43] I will see.
[520.80] Okay, sir.
[532.53] What is the timing for the meeting?
[533.93] After lunchtime.
[535.40] Is Aman group coming for the meeting?
[536.83] Yes. I have confirmed with them.
[539.03] Fine, send me a hard
copy of the presentation.
[541.93] Okay, I will have it sent.
[555.73] What happened?
Do you want to say something?
[557.53] Yes, Bano called.
[561.67] Who, Bano?
[563.20] The same
[565.33] who I had hired for 
Madam Farah as her maid.
[568.80] Yes. Then?
[570.07] She was saying
[571.93] Madam Farah has not eaten
anything since yesterday
[574.57] and neither is taking her medication.
[578.63] This is the value I have in your eyes now,
[580.77] that you have left me
at the mercy of the servants?
[583.63] I will not eat food till you come,
[586.83] neither will I take my medication.
[595.40] Fine, you go.
[597.27] Sure. Okay.
[604.20] And if something happens to me
[605.97] then only you will be responsible for it.
[624.87] Do we have to go somewhere, sir?
[626.93] Yes, I am going out.
[628.00] You do one thing,
[630.23] deal with the client.
[631.47] We will just come.
[632.07] Hey, no, you leave it. I will go.
[633.77] No, sir.
[635.03] I cannot leave you alone.
[636.97] Please.
[678.37] Papa.
[683.17] With whose permission did you come here?
[685.33] Huh?
[692.63] I don’t need anyone’s
permission to come to my Papa.
[703.57] You are not my daughter.
[708.83] You are not my daughter.
[716.83] The relationship between
a father and daughter
[718.37] doesn't end with words of denial.
[724.33] Go. Leave from here.
[725.83] Leave.
[732.43] I permitted you to come into the home,
[736.43] I have not accepted you.
[738.67] I will not leave.
[741.03] No matter how many times you reject me,
[742.37] I will come back to your
doorstep again and again.
[748.27] Leave from here.
[754.20] Papa, please.
[758.77] Papa.
[760.63] Papa, I made a mistake.
[767.43] I made a very big mistake, Papa.
[772.83] Please don't turn your back on me like this.
[776.17] Forgive me.
[787.00] When I used to make
a mistake in childhood,
[789.97] you would scold me,
[792.27] you would beat me up,
[794.37] but you wouldn’t drag me out
of the home like this, Papa.
[797.80] Papa, please.
[803.40] I have no place for you in my heart.
[805.80] I have no place for you, Dua.
[824.63] Here you go.
[826.00] Here.
[826.87] Hit me.
[828.07] Beat me and break my bones.
Leave me.
[829.97] But hit me. Hit me.
Leave me.
[832.47] I won't leave you.
Leave me.
[834.20] No, I won't leave you.
Leave me.
[835.27] Forgive me, Papa.
[836.40] Don’t leave a single bone of mine,
[837.73] but don’t be upset with me.
[838.87] Hit me.
Leave me.
[839.97] Please. Hit me, Papa. Break my bones,
[842.23] but don’t get upset with me.
[852.97] I have made a big mistake.
[858.93] My child.
[897.07] How are you?
[902.03] Why are you torturing yourself by not eating
and not taking your medicine?
[908.60] Did you finally find some time?
[911.87] Did you realize that 
a girl tried to give her life for you?
[917.07] Whether I am there or not,
[918.67] it makes no difference to you.
[921.07] Farah, I was busy.
[922.83] Were you so busy that you
were not even going to your home?
[926.83] You were giving time to your wife and home,
[928.87] so why did you ignore me?
[931.57] Oh yes,
[934.20] I am nothing to you.
[939.13] I have no meaning in your life,
[941.83] right?
[943.23] Right now, your health is most important.
[945.17] Please, care for it. That’s it.
[948.97] Really?
[950.67] Do you care about me?
[952.27] If I did not care about you,
I wouldn’t have come here.
[955.57] Then you shouldn’t have.
[957.27] I would have died,
[958.20] you would have offered
prayers of thankfulness.
[959.97] What are you….
[963.67] You have brought this here again.
[965.40] I have told her to do this.
[968.37] Keep this here and you can leave.
[974.40] Come on, have food.
[975.63] I am not hungry.
[978.40] Why do you act so stubbornly like a child?
[980.63] Am I being stubborn or
are you being stubborn?
[984.00] Farah, we have our
whole life for all these things.
[985.83] Right now, your health is important.
[987.73] Please, have food.
[989.43] Then I also have to take you to the doctor.
[998.63] I am saying something to you.
[1009.73] Please.
[1012.73] If you feed me with your hands, 
I will eat.
[1030.57] Fine.
[1032.93] I will die of hunger.
[1127.37] Thank God your wound is getting better.
[1129.97] The doctor has said that 
if you care a little,
[1131.47] you will be absolutely fine.
[1133.83] I don’t want my wound to heal.
[1137.23] You are close to me because of this wound.
[1144.03] You still talk so much nonsense.
[1146.77] And you are the same even today.
[1150.53] You go crazy over my slightest discomfort.
[1153.23] I just don’t forget the lesson of humanity.
[1156.67] Humanity?
[1158.93] Why?
[1160.60] Is it not love?
[1163.27] Look, Farah,
[1165.47] we have become mature now.
[1167.60] Love doesn't require age,
[1170.87] it requires madness.
[1172.97] Like I am mad about you even today,
[1175.27] and maybe you too are.
[1177.20] No,
[1179.33] I have been freed from
the captivity of those moments.
[1182.53] Really?
[1184.13] Then why did you save me?
[1185.43] You should have let me die.
[1192.57] I cannot see you dying.
[1195.20] When you don’t have love for me
[1196.03] then why can you not see it?
[1197.37] What do you want?
[1198.40] Should I also forget the lesson of humanity?
[1200.80] What do you want?
[1203.33] I know,
[1204.60] you are only upset with me
[1206.97] because I left you and went.
[1208.87] I was, earlier,
[1210.40] but not anymore.
[1212.57] In fact, I think you did the right thing.
[1218.00] Every person has
the right to decide on their choice.
[1221.67] I made a mistake.
[1224.73] Had I known
[1225.93] I wouldn’t be able to live without you,
[1227.43] then I would never have gone.
[1237.33] Give me my phone.
[1240.43] I told you to give me my phone.
[1242.80] You cannot talk to her with me here.
[1252.37] What was this?
[1253.47] When I said
[1255.07] that you won’t answer her call, 
in front of me,
[1257.20] so, you will not answer it.
[1292.93] Your tea.
[1295.20] I will drink it. I will drink it.
[1303.47] I don’t even have the words.
[1309.33] By forgiving Dua like this,
you have done a favor on motherhood.
[1318.57] For that,
[1320.63] I have forgiven you.
[1326.97] I don’t know why I feel
I made an emotional decision.
[1333.07] How long can parents
stay upset with their children?
[1340.47] Fehmida, I am thinking
about what people will say.
[1345.47] Mr. Aslam,
[1346.97] do you still care about people?
[1352.40] These people…
[1353.40] these people who used to point
fingers at my daughter until yesterday,
[1356.73] are now sitting with their fingers clenched 
in their teeth, looking at her grandeur.
[1364.67] These people are
[1365.97] only for pointing fingers at the oppressed.
[1368.67] Where did Dua get all these guards,
cars, and so much money from?
[1374.67] She was in very bad
condition at the police station.
[1376.83] You didn’t open your home’s door for Dua,
[1381.13] but perhaps God had mercy on her.
[1384.40] Before she would suffer from
wandering and hardships,
[1388.33] Ghaznavi came into her life.
[1390.80] Who…Who Ghaznavi?
[1392.07] Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[1393.93] He is really rich. 
He has a lot of money.
[1398.60] He married our Dua.
[1403.73] She is really happy.
[1405.37] He has kept her really happy.
[1408.17] Is he the same one for whom
Dua ran from the home?
[1411.47] Hey, no, no.
[1413.23] That damned man was someone else.
[1418.57] Mr. Aslam, you will see,
[1420.43] just as he made my Dua wander aimlessly,
[1423.17] he too will be left wandering and
[1425.63] will never find peace.
[1428.23] Our Dua,
[1429.40] despite everything, was reunited with us.
[1432.33] Now, we can only pray to God
to protect us from further trials.
[1457.73] Thank you, child.
[1468.37] Hey, I am thinking of inviting
my friend’s family over for dinner.
[1473.87] Which friend?
[1475.47] Hassam.
[1477.87] Is he the same one who is settled in the US?
[1481.37] Yes, son, the same.
[1485.13] Okay.
[1486.03] So, I have told you many times before to
[1489.47] please talk to him about settling me there.
[1494.00] Son, to settle down there,
[1497.00] a person needs to be somewhat steadfast.
[1500.60] You are not that.
[1510.83] You have to do a lot of things yourself,
[1514.07] and here, you don’t even move
and drink a glass of water.
[1517.33] Papa, when things become difficult,
[1518.53] one does what needs to be done.
[1519.57] Please talk to them.
[1522.07] Okay fine,
[1523.17] I will talk to him.
[1524.00] It is still not that late.
[1525.67] But first, you get a job here
and do it properly.
[1531.67] What is there in a job here?
[1533.83] Even if I work here for several years,
[1535.87] what will be the result? At most,
[1538.80] I will earn a hundred thousand
or one fifty thousand.
[1543.63] What can a person do with that?
[1546.80] Think a little.
[1553.80] Okay, tell me,
[1555.43] did he come here from America for good,
[1557.67] or did he only come on holiday?
[1559.13] No, no, he came on holiday.
[1560.47] He will go back.
[1562.00] Okay, okay.
[1563.17] His wife was very sociable.
[1564.97] Please let me know
when you are inviting them,
[1567.63] and also tell me
what should be made for dinner.
[1571.13] Hey, he will confirm till tomorrow,
[1574.73] then I will also tell you
what needs to be cooked.
[1577.23] You women can take care of everything.
[1584.97] By the way, you usually cook
traditional food at such parties.
[1590.93] No, no, the reason I was asking was that
[1592.83] because he is coming after a lot of years,
[1595.00] so we don’t know their likes and dislikes.
[1597.37] Who knows, they might
prefer international cuisine.
[1599.73] Hey, no, Hassam is the same old,
[1603.17] he hasn’t changed even a little.
[1607.43] Papa, don’t worry.
[1608.67] Me and sister-in-law
will do everything together.
[1611.20] Yes, Sumbul is absolutely right.
[1612.87] Both of us will manage it.
[1614.63] Hey, I know my daughters
will manage everything together.
[1624.37] But Hassam also has
another reason for coming here.
[1632.80] What reason?
[1634.47] The thing is,
[1636.47] Hassam has expressed his liking
for our Sumbul for his son, Fahad.
[1652.17] Really?
[1653.47] This is really good news.
[1660.03] Yes, but Papa,
[1662.37] have you met Fahad?
[1663.77] Have you seen him or not?
[1665.43] I have met him,
but it was a long time ago.
[1669.17] He was a child back then,
[1670.37] now he has grown up.
[1673.60] Hassam was telling me
he is a mechanical engineer.
[1684.60] But more importantly, he is Hassam’s son.
[1689.07] And when they come, you can meet them.
[1692.60] Okay, we will see.
[1703.20] Such a good proposal.
[1705.20] My daughter’s fate has really shined.
[1709.33] One minute.
[1711.57] Hey, did you see? Did you see her?
[1712.83] She felt shy hearing about her proposal.
[1795.13] It feels as though,
[1796.47] I met my own after a long time.
[1799.37] Sania, Fiza,
[1801.27] Mama, everyone was really happy.
[1802.97] Really, really happy.
[1805.57] And your Papa?
[1809.20] He didn’t agree.
[1812.80] He too will agree.
[1818.03] At least, this much happened
that he let you come inside,
[1820.97] he let you meet everyone.
[1825.17] All this is because of you.
[1827.93] What did I do?
[1831.63] The Dua from yesterday
was nameless, insignificant.
[1836.03] The position I have achieved
today is because of you.
[1839.80] Now, before anyone points a finger at me,
[1843.77] they think a hundred times.
[1846.67] Because you are
Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s respect.
[1913.07] You scared me.
[1920.57] You took so long to come today.
[1922.77] I had some work.
[1925.77] The work was so important that
[1927.23] you didn’t even have time
to listen to what I wanted to say.
[1931.13] The nature of the work was such.
[1933.97] You tell me,
[1935.13] you were really excited.
[1936.97] You said you couldn’t
tell me on the phone.
[1938.77] Hmmm.
[1939.20] Is everything okay?
[1941.73] Because I wanted to tell you face to face.
[1943.60] What is it that you want to
tell me face to face?
[1948.40] I went to Mama’s home.
[1950.33] Yes, I know.
[1956.67] Papa forgave me.
[1961.27] What? Really?
[1962.67] Yes.
[1963.87] This is a matter of great happiness.
[1965.37] Right?
[1966.77] Yes.
[1968.40] You ought to be happy like this.
[1970.47] I am really happy.
[1974.43] And I want you to
stay happy like this all your life.
[1983.07] I am really happy.
[1991.00] After all, I am the only owner of your love.
