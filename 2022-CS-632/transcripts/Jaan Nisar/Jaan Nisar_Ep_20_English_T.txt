[36.90] Sarfaraz, what is the matter
[39.47] that I cannot understand you?
[45.57] I have tolerated it today, but
[47.20] if your father talks 
like this in the future,
[49.97] then he will see the worst in me,
[52.87] and then I will deal 
with him in my manner.
[105.20] Greetings.
[107.30] Greetings.
[107.97] Why are you awake so soon?
[109.10] You should have rested.
[111.43] I am used to waking up 
for prayers in the morning
[113.73] and then university too…
[120.27] Hmm.
[123.63] If you want, then
[125.90] you can continue your studies.
[127.50] I will have no objections.
[131.33] Education?
[133.40] Hmm,
[135.07] if you want you can study further.
[141.03] Sure,
[141.90] I will think about it.
[143.43] Sure, think about it.
[146.33] Come on, we will have breakfast, 
and after that,
[149.13] I will show you your home.
[154.63] My home?
[158.30] This home is yours now.
[166.67] You have to take care of it.
[201.13] What is the matter, Saeein?
[203.73] You are worried.
[209.83] Yes.
[214.93] You think of the solution for 
a worry before it comes.
[220.60] I think about it, but…
[225.97] But what is 
the matter this time?
[230.80] I am worried because of
 the attack on Nosherwan yesterday.
[243.07] We shouldn’t take 
this attack normally.
[247.97] No matter how upset
 I am with him,
[251.00] he got married against our will.
[254.97] He got married Saeein,
[257.10] he didn’t sin.
[262.93] Hmm. Hmm.
[269.57] Did you find out?
[272.67] Did you find out who
 got the attack made?
[277.43] Yes,
[279.80] I have sent the men.
[282.63] We have so many enemies,
[286.17] they are investigating
[288.60] who dared to do this.
[297.23] Also keep the new enemies in mind,
 along with the old enemies.
[306.67] The enemies of our son
 are increasing day by day.
[312.13] Yes, you are right.
[318.60] I have sent the men,
[321.20] the enemy won't be 
able to hide for long.
[324.10] They should not be able to either.
[325.50] I had spoken to Nosherwan.
[328.80] Thank God,
[330.77] he and the daughter-in-law,
 both are fine.
[333.30] Thank God.
[336.90] After Zawar,
[340.67] I don’t have the courage
 to lose Nosherwan.
[346.83] You are right.
[351.10] But why would the 
enemy care about this?
[360.97] Saeein, I was thinking that you
[363.60] increase the security for Nosherwan.
[366.83] Send some more men 
of ours from here.
[369.93] You never know about the enemy,
[372.13] what if they attack again, then?
[376.17] Hmmm.
[378.73] I too was thinking 
about the same thing.
[381.10] Don’t think about it. Just do it.
[385.40] I will. I will.
[387.33] God has been really kind
[390.20] that both their lives got saved.
[392.50] I have done charity.
[395.10] Also, give goats.
[397.60] Yes
[398.30] Baba Saaein,
[401.03] Amma Saeein,
 I don’t feel too good.
[405.17] I will go to the room.
[407.13] Hey, child,
[408.30] have a proper breakfast.
[410.70] I have had it.
[412.93] Let her go Saeein.
[415.03] It is possible she is feeling suffocated
 by what we are saying.
[423.60] But Kashmala,
[424.97] don’t go to the room,
[427.13] go out in the open air,
[430.33] and you will feel good.
[434.30] Sure, Amma Saaein.
[460.90] Thank God you are fine.
[463.77] When Sania told me
[464.83] you were unwell all night long,
[466.17] I had gotten really worried.
[467.67] Now that I have seen you,
[469.53] I am at peace or else I would 
have remained worried.
[474.27] I will go now.
[476.57] Hey, child, if you have come, 
then stay for a while.
[479.63] No, mama, I will go now.
[482.13] What’s this coming and going 
for just two minutes, Fiza?
[487.50] In an instant, you have started
 feeling like a stranger.
[492.00] I didn’t inform them before coming,
[493.87] and if I get late,
[495.37] then everyone at 
home will get worried.
[496.90] That’s why.
[502.13] You did good that you came over.
[506.03] I was worried because of the behavior 
of Sister Kausar and Sarfaraz yesterday.
[514.53] Child,
[516.97] are they treating you well?
[519.67] Yes, yes, everything is fine.
[521.40] I also came thinking that
[523.33] you would be worried after yesterday.
[531.17] Child,
[534.37] you started the job by your will, right?
[538.60] Yes, mama.
[541.77] I don’t know why
[543.83] my heart doesn’t believe your truth.
[549.83] Why are you worrying yourself,
[551.47] and also worrying me too.
[553.37] I am telling you,
[554.97] everything is fine with me over there.
[559.40] Okay.
[561.67] I believe you if you say it.
[564.37] Greetings, papa.
[567.30] You?
[568.90] You have come again?
[571.10] Mr. Aslam.
[572.20] You be quiet.
[573.63] Mr. Aslam. Mr. Aslam.
[575.03] Haven't you had enough?
[576.37] Huh?
[577.27] You came with your husband and
 mother-in-law, yesterday
[579.57] and now you're back the next 
day to humiliate us even more?
[582.57] I just came to meet you.
[584.73] Why did you come to meet us?
[585.93] What is the need?
[586.97] Are you not content?
[588.53] I married you off,
[590.20] still, you come over.
[592.30] There is no need. 
We are dead for you.
[594.50] Forget our home.
[597.00] And one more thing,
[598.30] If your in-laws, or that
 loudmouth husband of yours,
[600.67] come near this house again,
[602.53] I'll break your husband's legs
[604.80] and I'll kill you.
[612.77] I will go, mama.
[615.60] I am getting late.
[643.50] So, how do you like the home?
[645.47] Really good.
[648.03] But do you live alone
 in such a big home?
[651.40] I used to live alone,
[654.27] but now, you are with me.
[656.63] Hmmm
[658.53] I mean,
[660.57] your Mama, Papa,
[662.40] Brothers and Sisters?
[666.03] My brother got murdered
 some time back.
[672.67] Murder?
[674.83] How?
[678.27] I will share everything with you.
[682.20] Earlier, I had no one
[683.53] who I would say all this to.
[686.73] Now I will share my sorrow, happiness,
and everything with you.
[691.80] But,
[693.50] do you people have any enmity?
[696.90] Come. Sit.
[703.10] Even that attack last night…
[709.67] When you have 
money and power,
[713.03] then these enemies
 are made automatically.
[718.43] You don’t need to make 
them separately.
[721.93] We and our mansion
[723.33] have always supported the poor.
[727.27] That is why,
[728.37] Baba Saeein’s enemies had an 
issue with his good reputation.
[732.93] I will take you to 
the mansion someday.
[734.47] When you see everything,
[735.80] you will understand.
[745.27] What are you thinking?
[748.90] Nothing.
[757.43] Why didn’t Baba and Amma 
Saeein not come to our wedding?
[764.57] Had I asked them,
 they would have surely come.
[771.77] Any special reason for hiding it?
[774.67] No, there was no special reason.
[782.53] Maybe I am not 
a good girl in their eyes,
[785.83] and that’s why you didn’t find
 it necessary to inform them.
[789.97] That is not true, at all.
[795.40] Indeed,
[797.30] I didn’t seek their 
permission for this wedding.
[801.90] But I had informed both of them
[803.13] when I came to marry you.
[805.57] In fact, when you were unconscious,
[806.90] Amma Saeein called
[807.77] and she was asking
 about your well-being.
[811.20] Had those people said
 no to this wedding,
[817.83] then would you 
refuse to marry me?
[822.77] Only my heart’s permission
 was enough for me to marry you.
[833.97] I am scared.
[838.33] What if in the future,
[840.00] you get over me,
[844.07] or if you leave me
 under someone’s pressure,
[849.40] then I will go back to Zunaira…
[860.30] I would want that you don’t take
 Zunaira’s name in the future.
[871.73] Forget your past considering
 it a bad dream.
[877.03] Your companionship is 
a beautiful dream for me.
[886.27] Waking up,
[888.03] I made myself believe 
that this is not a dream,
[891.57] it is reality.
[894.00] I should forget my past.
[899.80] But still,
[901.97] I have this fear.
[908.57] Why? Don’t you trust me?
[910.47] I do.
[911.40] I trust you a lot.
[915.03] But I fear my fate.
[918.67] Happiness just doesn’t suit me.
[926.27] Get rid of all these fears 
and anxieties from your mind,
[936.03] because now your fate
[938.83] is tied to the fate of 
Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[947.13] I am putting this home in your name.
[951.47] What is the need for this?
[954.13] There surely is.
[956.67] In the future, at least you 
will not have the fear
[958.30] that if I leave you,
 then where will you go?
[965.10] Meaning you plan on leaving me?
[978.13] Never.
[981.17] I have held this 
hand for all my life.
[988.07] I will never leave you.
[993.53] Have faith in me,
 as well as my love.
[1033.67] Madam, have food.
[1039.73] I don’t want to eat, take it away.
[1042.70] Who are you punishing by
 keeping yourself hungry?
[1045.50] You will fall ill this way.
[1047.43] So, let me get unwell.
[1049.30] I want to die.
[1052.77] Since when did my madam 
become so weak
[1055.40] that she is talking about death?
[1057.33] May your enemies die.
[1059.27] I had tried that, but she survived.
[1063.37] She had good luck,
[1064.57] that’s why she survived.
[1066.83] And what about my luck?
[1069.43] Huh?
[1070.93] It's like snakes are 
writhing on my chest, right?
[1073.47] If you give up so quickly,
[1075.40] how will it work?
[1076.67] I even advised you 
to get a hold on sir,
[1081.03] but did you ever listen to me?
[1083.80] It takes time and effort to seize 
control of a foreign territory...
[1086.37] I tried.
[1088.47] Before I could establish
 my hold there,
[1092.33] someone else came and 
made a place there.
[1094.40] She will leave as quickly,
 as she came.
[1101.63] How can you say this?
[1103.87] I have heard she has not
 come from a good place,
[1106.93] sir will get over her really soon.
[1110.97] And in the meantime,
[1112.63] should I just keep
 burning with anger,
[1113.97] huh?
[1114.80] Why will you burn? She will burn.
[1117.37] What burning are 
you talking about?
[1119.23] She is sitting comfortably, 
having taken over your sir’s heart.
[1122.63] She has seized control
 of his home and property,
[1124.73] and here I am, burning with anger.
[1127.67] Instead of burning yourself,
[1129.27] why don’t you make
 arrangements for them to burn?
[1131.83] How do I do it?
[1133.47] Tell me.
[1135.60] Baba Saeein and 
Amma Saeein
[1137.37] even accepted his marriage.
[1139.00] How do I do it?
[1140.03] Even if they have accepted it,
[1141.77] but your importance
 is in its place.
[1145.00] You have been the eldest 
daughter-in-law of this mansion.
[1148.17] You have a double status,
[1150.37] and you need to assert this
 status over that newcomer.
[1155.57] Remind her of her 
place and her worth.
[1161.77] Instead of crying and sobbing,
[1163.80] you need to make her cry.
[1167.33] Show her that
[1169.00] you can put her back in her 
place whenever you want.
[1173.90] Do you understand
[1177.90] what I am trying to explain to you?
[1232.23] Where is your daughter-in-law?
[1234.13] I had asked her for tea.
[1236.77] She is a really lazy girl.
[1239.73] Fiza.
[1241.47] Where are you?
[1242.60] Are you making tea or curry?
[1244.93] Yes, I am coming. I am coming.
[1250.57] Here you go.
[1251.63] Should I get something
 more for you?
[1253.23] Hey, what is this?
[1254.30] You only brought
 a single cup of tea,
[1255.90] that too for your husband.
[1257.40] Did you forget your mother-in-law?
[1259.30] You didn’t ask me, so…
[1260.77] Okay,
[1261.87] so I will only get tea 
when I ask for it.
[1265.33] No, I will just make it and bring it.
[1267.03] Just leave it.
[1268.97] If I have to ask you 
to take care of me,
[1270.17] then what is the point of it?
[1271.17] I will make it myself.
[1272.80] Where is your focus?
[1275.03] Do you have any sense in you?
[1276.73] You spoiled Mama’s 
mood for no reason.
[1278.53] No, actually,
[1280.73] she had it a little while back,
[1282.37] so I thought…
[1283.17] What? What?
[1284.97] Now you will also keep a check 
on how much I eat and drink.
[1287.93] Wow, just wow.
[1289.10] You are amazing.
[1290.90] I will just bring it in two minutes.
[1292.90] I told you,
[1294.47] now I don’t feel like having it.
[1297.17] Tell me something.
[1299.77] Today, you came late
 from school again.
[1302.17] Huh? Err…
[1303.77] She must have gone to 
her parents’ home.
[1306.03] This is the benefit
[1307.33] of the school being close
 to the parent’s home.
[1309.23] Here,
[1309.97] she uses the traffic as an excuse
[1311.60] and there she sits at 
her parents' home
[1312.67] and talks to her mother
 and sister for hours.
[1314.67] No, no, not for hours.
[1316.10] I just sat with Mama for a little while.
[1318.40] See. See.
[1320.13] Her theft has been caught.
[1321.70] Did we give you permission
 to go out of the home,
[1324.30] so that you do what you want?
[1325.77] Is this why you go 
out of the home daily?
[1327.50] No, I don’t go daily.
[1329.93] Today, Sania told me that
[1332.03] Mama is not well, so that is why,
[1334.20] I went for a little while.
[1335.43] Did you not get satisfied getting 
us humiliated by your father,
[1339.10] that you went there again?
[1340.60] Mama, the truth is
 all this is your fault.
[1343.07] She got permission to
 go because of you.
[1345.20] Now suffer the consequences.
[1346.10] I told…
[1347.00] Hey,
[1348.47] how was I to know
[1349.77] she will step out and do
 what she wants?
[1352.47] Hmmm.
[1353.83] By the way, how can she not do it?
[1356.33] Obviously, she too has 
the same blood as Dua.
[1366.03] Understand one thing well,
[1369.80] because I decide to 
make you understand,
[1372.87] then it will not be good for you.
[1377.50] You have driven me mad.
[1411.63] Madam,
[1413.17] sir is on the phone for you.
[1419.03] Hello.
[1419.70] What were you doing?
[1422.13] I was waiting for 
you to come back.
[1424.30] If you love me so much,
[1425.73] I will leave everything
[1427.10] and just sit with you.
[1429.47] Okay, listen, 
I sent something for you.
[1431.97] I hope you will like it.
[1434.30] If you have sent it, it must be good.
[1436.93] Goodbye.
[1446.67] Madam,
[1448.10] sir has sent some things for you
[1450.13] and he has said that
[1450.57] you will wear this over dinner today.
[1453.70] Keep it.
[1462.43] Hello.
[1466.97] Yes, I will let you talk to her.
[1469.63] Madam,
[1470.53] there is a call for you.
[1472.40] For me?
[1473.33] Yes, for you.
[1475.47] Fine, you can leave.
[1479.40] Hello.
[1481.17] How are you, love?
[1482.97] Rumi.
[1484.10] Yes, Rumi.
[1485.80] The same Rumi you forgot as 
soon as you left from here.
[1488.57] That is not true.
[1490.83] When did I forget you?
[1492.13] You didn’t think of me either.
[1495.23] Or should I say that
[1497.17] the hero didn’t let you 
remember anything?
[1498.83] It is not like that.
[1500.70] You are not someone 
who can be forgotten.
[1502.60] Yes, that is true.
[1504.20] Okay, tell me, are you happy?
[1507.30] What do you feel?
[1509.30] The happiness in your
 tone makes it evident
[1511.40] that you are really happy.
[1515.30] Ghaznavi is really good.
[1517.17] There is no doubt about that.
[1519.13] I just pray that you
 always rule his heart.
[1522.87] Amen.
[1525.10] I have called you for the last 
time to feel this happiness.
[1528.63] Last time?
[1530.53] What do you mean, last time?
[1532.43] You can always call me, Rumi.
[1535.03] As soon I get a phone,
[1536.40] you will be the first one 
I send the number to.
[1538.40] You can call me
 whenever you want.
[1540.77] No, my love, don’t do that.
[1543.57] I just want that 
we don’t stay in touch.
[1545.77] We don’t stay in touch?
[1548.27] But why?
[1549.30] You coming here 
was an accident,
[1551.03] and along with prayers,
[1552.27] I was trying hard to get you out 
of here, as soon as possible.
[1554.83] See,
[1555.77] how my prayer got
 answered within moments,
[1557.97] and you left from here forever,
 as Mrs. Nosherwan.
[1560.90] You are right.
[1563.97] But Rumi,
[1565.90] what is the harm in our friendship?
[1568.67] You have become the 
daughter-in-law of a really good family.
[1572.13] You are the wife of 
a man like Nosherwan.
[1574.70] God knows how many girls long 
to see just one glimpse of him.
[1578.60] I don’t want
[1580.07] the reference of a woman like 
Zunaira to stay with you because of me.
[1584.17] You too forget coming 
here as a bad dream.
[1588.63] Yes, I will always pray for you.
[1593.13] You are doing a big injustice, Rumi.
[1596.30] There is no injustice.
[1597.67] You will be really happy
[1599.33] and you will see, 
you won’t even remember
[1600.93] that you were ever friends 
with someone like Rumi.
[1603.13] I never forget good friends.
[1608.20] I want you to come to meet me.
[1630.63] Hey, you people still 
haven’t started eating.
[1634.00] I had brought hot and fresh
 kebabs with the rice.
[1637.27] Child, it is enough.
[1639.20] Keep this and you too sit down.
[1640.50] Yes. Yes. I am also coming.
[1642.60] The yoghurt is left, I will bring it.
[1644.33] I will bring the yoghurt.
[1645.50] Huh, okay.
[1653.33] Why do you portray that only 
you do all the work at home?
[1658.13] The maid comes
 in the morning to clean up
[1660.73] and Sumbul is with you to help you
 when you are cooking in the kitchen, right?
[1665.37] Yes. Sumbul helps me a lot.
[1669.77] Hey, how long has 
she been married for,
[1672.30] that you are putting the burden of
 home management on the daughter-in-law?
[1675.07] So, it is good that
[1676.63] she is taking care of the home.
[1679.47] Why should we count Sumbul?
[1680.77] She is here today,
[1681.83] she will go to her in-laws’
 home in the future,
[1683.77] then who will take care of the home?
[1685.60] She will, right?
[1687.17] It is good she is getting
 used to working.
[1689.53] But, till the time Sumbul is at home,
[1691.20] let her do some work as well.
[1693.57] She will learn some
 home management.
[1694.93] Papa, sister-in-law doesn’t
 let me do anything.
[1698.27] Child, it is a good thing that
[1700.10] your sister-in-law takes 
so much care of you.
[1703.00] Now, when she cares for you,
[1705.40] then you too should take care of her.
[1707.43] Absolutely.
[1708.27] I will take a lot of care
 of my sister-in-law.
[1711.93] That’s good.
[1714.20] Okay. Okay, fine. Have food.
[1716.43] Child, pass the rice.
[1717.97] Hey, you have not 
taken anything till now.
[1720.70] And, Mr. Sarfaraz,
[1723.70] don’t you have to take 
Fiza for an outing?
[1728.60] Outing?
[1730.13] Yes.
[1733.37] Papa, my condition 
is in front of you.
[1736.10] When do I have money?
[1738.23] And I have told you,
[1740.23] I have applied for a job 
at a lot of places.
[1742.77] Things will move forward
 when I hear from someone.
[1746.37] And,
[1748.20] after all, it won’t seem nice
[1749.87] that I have taken money from you,
 for even the outing.
[1752.20] Great.
[1753.23] Since when did you 
start thinking like this?
[1757.63] My son’s thinking has changed.
[1761.10] He has become sensible now.
[1762.73] But this overnight change?
[1765.37] When is it overnight?
[1767.07] He is married now,
[1769.47] and then what will
 he say to his wife?
[1771.60] I am taking you for an outing 
with money from Papa.
[1774.50] I pray to God that he gets a job,
[1776.53] then he will look good taking
 care of all these things.
[1779.67] Listen,
[1780.97] instead of making him understand,
[1783.00] you are encouraging him?
[1786.50] Papa, mama is right, you know.
[1791.23] My conscience doesn’t allow it.
[1794.10] I have told you,
[1794.90] that once I get a job, then
[1796.70] we will think about the outing.
[1798.37] Okay fine.
[1799.83] If you want to say that
[1802.37] you will take her later, then alright.
[1804.90] First class. But
[1806.83] right now, do one thing,
[1809.10] take Fiza shopping tomorrow.
[1812.30] Shopping?
[1813.60] Why should he take her shopping?
[1814.90] I just got so many things made
 in the wedding dresses,
[1818.20] and I had sent such 
good wedding gifts,
[1820.37] I sent such pretty dresses
[1822.57] and she too had brought along
 a few dresses with herself.
[1825.93] What is the need 
for shopping right now?
[1828.30] Mama, there is no 
need for shopping,
[1830.13] you need to be in 
the mood for shopping.
[1831.47] After all, the weather is changing.
[1833.07] Sister-in-law will buy clothes for 
herself as per the changing weather.
[1836.57] Hey, you stay quiet.
[1838.20] Sumbul is absolutely right.
[1841.00] The weather is changing, so
[1842.77] what if she too makes 
two new dresses?
[1846.13] And mister,
[1847.53] if you want to make 
the same excuse here, that
[1850.87] you will go buy clothes
 with your father’s money,
[1854.23] then think that
[1855.47] I too am taking care of your 
and Sumbul’s expenses,
[1859.57] so even if I spend 
a little more for Fiza,
[1862.40] then what is the harm in that?
[1864.50] After all,
[1866.47] my Fiza is just like Sumbul.
[1882.33] What are you thinking?
[1886.10] Nothing special.
[1889.03] I will not be able to tolerate you thinking
 about anyone else, with me there.
[1893.90] Really?
[1897.83] You look really beautiful.
[1902.93] So beautiful that 
I want this moment to stop here,
[1911.93] and I continue
 to see you like this.
[1920.20] You are weird.
[1925.13] What do you mean?
[1928.60] Meaning,
[1931.40] weird.
[1933.40] At times I don’t understand
[1936.00] if I should respect you 
more or love you more.
[1940.30] Whatever you want.
[1945.37] I promise,
[1947.77] neither of them
 will ever get reduced.
[1961.53] This is for you.
[1964.70] This…
[1966.10] Open it.
[1974.77] How do you like it?
[1978.57] Really beautiful.
[1981.30] It will look even more 
beautiful when you wear it.
[1986.60] I didn’t give you anything
 as your wedding gift.
[1989.40] This is your wedding gift.
[1993.10] You have given me so much,
[1997.43] I don’t want anything else.
[1999.90] I have no longing for anything else.
[2003.30] I am with you for all my life.
