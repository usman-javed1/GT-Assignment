[29.24] Sir, order.
[32.24] Hmmm.
[35.64] Just bring a strong cup of tea.
[37.40] Okay, sir.
[56.20] Hello.
[57.24] I thought I would appreciate 
you on your performance.
[61.60] Thank you.
[62.64] You have completely surprised me.
[65.28] Just to raise suspicion in Nosherwan's 
mind and re-enter Dua's life,
[70.76] you went as far as divorcing Fiza.
[75.68] I mean,
[76.88] you are smarter than I expected.
[81.04] Look, the thing is,
[83.48] I'm not in the habit of nurturing tension,
[86.56] and I'm not one to forgive those 
who challenge me.
[95.36] Now the score with Fiza has been settled.
[99.64] As for Dua,
[102.84] she humiliated me in front of 
my own people,
[107.16] and I’ll make sure to settle that score 
by completely destroying her.
[109.92] You are playing well.
[111.44] Just continue your performance like this.
[114.24] Then, no one can stop you 
from becoming rich.
[119.24] Yes, that’s how it is.
[122.00] I just need your guidance.
[123.84] I am with you, at every step.
[129.72] Because the purpose of my life 
is the same as yours.
[138.40] Dua’s destruction.
[154.72] It is fine.
[156.80] Tell younger madam to come 
and have tea with us.
[159.72] She will not come.
[164.16] Why?
[165.60] I don’t know, she is a little disturbed.
[172.72] Disturbed? Why?
[174.28] Is she feeling alright?
[177.84] Did you say something to her?
[181.68] Why would I say anything?
[184.16] Does she not have enough caring 
people to say things to her?
[198.16] You say what you want, clearly.
[206.28] I know you don’t like Dua 
because she is my love.
[216.04] Remember one thing,
[219.44] it is not possible that you say 
something to me and I blindly believe it.
[224.32] It will never happen.
[227.16] I have no such illusions, Nosherwan,
[234.76] that I could come and 
say anything to you,
[237.64] and Dua would be removed 
from your heart.
[244.36] But the fact remains, doesn't it,
[247.16] that the importance you give her,
[250.68] she doesn't give you in return.
[255.44] I know well how much Dua loves me 
and how much importance she gives me.
[268.36] For this, I don’t need a certificate 
from you or anyone else.
[275.64] You know it so well,
[278.00] so tell me, why did she secretly 
meet her brother-in-law?
[286.52] Oh,
[287.76] sorry.
[289.40] He is no longer her brother-in-law.
[291.96] He has divorced Fiza now.
[301.92] Had he not done this,
[304.72] then how would he marry Dua?
[314.60] And,
[316.40] I think he came here 
to tell her all this.
[327.72] Sarfaraz came here?
[329.92] When?
[332.16] In the morning.
[334.20] Didn’t Dua tell you?
[336.68] I thought you must be given 
all the information.
[346.20] And Nosherwan, if you don’t believe me,
[349.64] you can ask the guards and watchman.
[358.32] And ask them a little strictly.
[365.96] Dua had given them some money
to keep their mouths shut.
[372.68] What did he say?
[376.40] He was convincing Dua.
[384.88] He was telling her,
[386.76] that I have divorced Fiza,
[390.16] now you too take a divorce 
from Nosherwan,
[393.36] so that the two of us can become one.
[398.64] He was saying he was not able 
to live without her.
[403.80] He loves her a lot.
[407.44] And Nosherwan, 
the way she was standing quietly
[413.48] and didn’t even tell you,
[416.24] it gives the impression that she agrees.
[462.12] Who let Sarfaraz come inside?
[464.44] Sir, younger madam asked us to let him in.
[466.88] Why did you not stop her?
[468.60] Sir, it was younger madam’s order,
how could I stop him?
[472.76] Nosherwan,
[474.32] why are you scolding these poor people?
[477.16] These poor souls are just slaves to orders.
[488.20] You two leave from here.
[489.36] Yes sir.
[496.32] You don’t trust me,
[502.88] at least trust what these people are saying.
[511.12] When will you understand?
[514.84] Dua is playing with your emotions.
[552.96] What I said yesterday is 
the same thing I'm saying today
[555.76] that I love you
[558.48] and I want to marry you.
[561.16] And if I married Fiza,
[562.72] then it was only because I had 
pressure on me from people.
[580.76] What happened? 
You didn’t come to have tea.
[586.80] I had a headache.
[592.12] Any special reason for the headache?
[599.60] Did something happen?
[601.72] No.
[603.68] Nothing special.
[608.72] Did someone come to meet you
at home today?
[621.92] No.
[623.00] No one.
[626.36] You are lying!
[635.04] Why would I lie?
[637.44] Sarfaraz came to meet you today.
[642.64] Any special reason for hiding it?
[647.60] Why did you not tell me?
[650.96] I didn’t want that he is mentioned 
in front of you again and again,
[657.64] and you get worried.
[665.60] Jaffar was not at home, 
so I thought that
[668.40] you won’t find out.
[670.00] That’s why I even told 
the guard not to tell you.
[672.32] That man proposed to you 
and went from here.
[678.36] He said that he divorced your sister 
so that he could marry you.
[684.48] Tell me, is this a lie?
[686.68] Is this something so small 
that you hide it from me?
[688.56] Please, I just wanted to 
keep you away from stress.
[691.24] Stress?
[696.28] The truth is that your actions 
are stressing me.
[699.44] Are you doubting me?
[701.96] Yes,
[705.84] because you have forced me to do this.
[709.68] I was going to tell you everything.
[712.64] I want to tell you everything 
but at the right time.
[721.44] I didn’t want to worry you.
[727.16] I myself am really worried.
[728.92] Over there, Fiza is not talking to me,
[730.60] she doesn’t want to see 
my face and Sarfaraz…
[733.32] If you had nothing for Sarfaraz in your heart,
[735.80] then why did you let him come inside?
[737.24] And why are you lying to me?
[738.48] I didn’t let him come inside. 
I don’t know how he came inside.
[741.28] Really?
[744.12] Who told the watchman 
to let him inside?
[745.96] I don’t know. 
You are lying again.
[748.08] I am not lying. You can call the guards
and ask them.
[750.64] After questioning the watchman, 
I’ve concluded that you’re betraying me.
[759.12] So stop it now.
[765.68] The truth is out in front of me.
[769.64] The truth is that you are misunderstanding me.
[816.68] Why did you people lie to Ghaznavi?
[819.32] Why did you say that 
I called Sarfaraz into the house?
[824.24] I had told them to say this.
[828.20] You people can leave from here.
[829.84] Sure Madam.
[835.56] So, all this is your game.
[839.16] Yes,
[840.60] and how did you like this game?
[842.32] Did you like it?
[846.72] Can I ask you the reason?
[849.32] You can surely ask.
[852.24] You are the one 
who started this game, Dua.
[854.64] I am just putting my share in it.
[858.44] And I thought there was also 
a need for my share.
[862.36] How did you like it, huh?
[867.08] You stay away from my matters.
[870.32] Hey, how do I stay away like this?
[872.92] If these matters had pertained to you, 
I would have stayed away.
[876.80] This is a matter of my husband.
[883.72] And till the time you remain stuck 
to Nosherwan Ghaznavi,
[888.88] I cannot stay away from this matter.
[894.48] Is this your plan?
[896.04] Yes.
[897.80] That’s the plan.
[898.96] You know, you are really intelligent.
[905.44] You understood my plan so quickly.
[911.68] And if you were not intelligent,
[914.60] then how would you have 
trapped a married man,
[916.84] and gotten married to him?
[925.48] But don’t worry,
[927.56] till the time I don’t distance you 
from Nosherwan,
[931.96] I too will not sit peacefully.
[936.44] And why do you worry?
[938.60] You have Sarfaraz as an option.
[945.12] You can go to him, 
you can settle with him, yes?
[951.52] I wish you too were a little intelligent,
[959.36] then you would have understood 
that Ghaznavi doesn’t love you.
[967.12] End the game you have started.
[971.12] I have never challenged your position.
[975.32] You too don’t do it.
[976.60] It makes no difference to me, 
whether he loves me or not.
[988.00] I am his wife
[990.20] and I will not surrender till the time
I don’t distance him from you.
[996.76] Why don’t you go to the mansion?
[999.72] You really love the mansion 
and the wealth there, yes?
[1005.88] I have immense love for the mansion,
[1009.84] the grandeur, the wealth,
[1013.04] but even more for Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[1019.36] I can’t tolerate him staying here with you.
[1028.80] Fine, I can make a sacrifice for you.
[1031.56] If Nosherwan goes and stays 
in the mansion with me,
[1035.16] then you can stay here with your lover, 
what’s his name? Sarfaraz.
[1044.32] I will not mind.
[1048.52] This is just your wish
[1053.80] that Ghaznavi will go with you.
[1057.12] It will remain a mere wish.
[1060.60] It is not a wish, Dua.
[1063.60] It is hope,
[1069.76] and the world runs on hope.
[1145.44] Sania.
[1148.08] Sania.
[1149.56] Bring it, child.
[1150.64] Sister, come on, have food.
[1153.56] I am not hungry.
[1155.84] How are you not hungry?
[1157.64] Come on, eat a little.
[1161.72] In fact, I will feed my daughter 
with my hands today.
[1171.88] Sister, stop it. 
Don’t cry like this.
[1174.84] If you cry like this, 
it will hurt us.
[1189.80] Greetings.
[1192.60] Greetings.
[1195.40] -Hey, Fiza…
-Fiza.
[1206.84] Mama, what has happened to her?
[1209.92] Why does she leave 
as soon as I come?
[1220.64] If she does this,
[1223.44] won’t I be the only one who ends up
looking guilty in everyone's eyes?
[1229.60] You are innocent yet 
you are her sinner, Dua.
[1238.72] You are my mother.
[1241.16] Will you still say this?
[1243.52] Yes.
[1245.20] I am your mother,
[1248.00] but I have also given birth to Fiza.
[1251.80] I feel the pain of both my daughters.
[1255.56] Dua, the truth is,
[1258.52] that Fiza is suffering the punishment
for your sins.
[1262.92] Mama,
[1265.16] you know that I am really ashamed.
[1275.60] What use is your shame to us?
[1283.08] The damage that was to be done 
to Fiza has been done.
[1286.24] Fiza has been ruined.
[1297.12] I wish…
[1299.60] I wish you had not opened the back door,
[1308.00] then all of us wouldn’t have been 
suffering from this pain today.
[1321.28] Dua…
[1323.32] Dua, you are somehow responsible, 
for all of this.
[1328.48] All of it.
[1363.72] He was convincing Dua.
[1366.16] He was telling her,
[1368.16] that I have divorced Fiza,
[1371.56] now you too take a divorce from Nosherwan,
[1374.80] so that the two of us can become one.
[1377.08] He was saying he was not able 
to live without her.
[1382.08] He loves her a lot.
[1385.84] And Nosherwan,
[1387.20] the way she was standing quietly
[1391.80] and didn’t even tell you,
[1394.68] it gives the impression that she agrees.
[1407.68] I have brought him, sir.
[1418.84] Yes?
[1421.88] Why did you call me?
[1426.84] Why did you come home yesterday?
[1431.28] Okay,
[1433.24] this means that Dua told you.
[1444.08] I want to hear it from you.
[1447.96] Hey,
[1449.56] what do you want to hear? 
It would have been better that
[1452.52] Dua had told you everything herself.
[1454.20] But, fine, since you’ve gone through 
the trouble to call me here,
[1460.08] I will tell you everything.
[1462.92] Yes, I did come to your house yesterday.
[1475.08] I came at Dua's request. 
She called me.
[1488.00] Now,
[1490.56] if you want to know 
what we talked about there,
[1493.00] then the summary for it is that
[1495.48] we had an incomplete love 
and we want to complete it.
[1513.20] Now, in this matter, 
if I can divorce her sister,
[1518.84] then can't she get a divorce 
from you for my sake?
[1531.08] Now, look, think about this 
calmly and peacefully.
[1533.76] There is nothing to get 
so upset about this.
[1537.60] Why are you trying 
to take control of her?
[1547.28] Yes, she used to love me, 
she wanted to marry me,
[1551.64] she had to marry you out of helplessness,
[1553.84] because of my stupidity, or else
[1557.24] you were nowhere in between.
[1568.72] And now if Dua wants me 
to come back into her life,
[1575.48] why are you causing hurdles in the middle?
[1577.00] Why are you causing us pain?
[1587.32] I still haven’t given you pain.
[1592.96] Yes and if you give me pain,
[1596.80] then I will not be the only one 
who will feel pain.
[1603.68] She too will feel the pain,
[1607.16] and the thing is that
[1609.56] if the two of us live together, 
that has our happiness in it.
[1618.76] And it was my job to lift the veil 
from your eyes, which I have done.
[1624.64] Now, it’s up to you.
[1635.88] I think it would be better if you separate
your paths from her and divorce her.
[1649.84] Think about this.
[1652.60] Anything else?
[1655.32] You can leave.
[1660.56] I will go now.
[1686.16] He spoke way beyond his limits, sir.
[1692.72] He has said so much. 
There must be some truth in this.
[1696.12] If you tell me, 
I will remove him from the way.
[1697.96] Not yet.
[1700.56] Don’t cause him any harm till
the entire truth is in front of us.
[1707.68] Keep an eye on him.
[1709.52] He is lying. 
He is speaking nonsense, sir.
[1832.48] Madam. 
Yes?
[1833.96] Tell me the dinner menu 
so that I start preparing food.
[1837.44] For dinner, do one thing,
[1840.40] make kebabs,
[1842.80] along with pilaf,
[1846.44] and chicken, and also grill some fish.
[1849.56] Yes, Madam, it will all be done.
[1856.24] Stop.
[1858.16] Yes, Madam?
[1863.80] I think you should make 
grilled chicken for dinner.
[1868.32] Sir really likes it
[1874.08] and meatballs filled with eggs 
are also his favourite.
[1877.64] So, prepare what I have asked you. Okay?
[1881.44] Sure.
[1882.16] Do one thing, 
prepare what I have told you. Okay?
[1885.72] Sure, Madam.
[1892.28] When I told her the menu,
[1895.00] then what was the need to change it?
[1900.16] Look, the thing is that 
this is not your mansion,
[1904.08] where the servants follow your orders.
[1907.76] So what if this is not the mansion?
[1911.12] The servants are still ours, aren’t they?
[1914.44] A servant is a servant,
[1916.72] and a master is a master.
[1919.96] The servant has to obey 
the master no matter what,
[1924.76] whether it’s in a mansion 
or anywhere else.
[1928.16] Absolutely.
[1929.56] But, Madam Kashmala, 
this is my home.
[1935.64] Here, the servants listen to me.
[1938.24] You give orders in the mansion.
[1942.60] What are you so proud of, Dua, huh?
[1947.88] Nothing at all.
[1954.08] I just want to make you understand that
[1956.88] no matter what you try,
[1959.12] you cannot snatch Ghaznavi from me.
[1962.24] By constantly reminding me of my defeat,
[1966.08] you’re forcing me to win, Dua.
[1972.32] What if I defeat you in such a way,
[1977.80] that you are not left with anything?
[1986.76] Dua,
[1988.00] what happened?
[1993.20] What happened to her?
[1996.68] How would I know?
[1999.12] She was fine till now. 
She was talking properly.
[2001.88] Dua, what happened?
[2003.68] -Nothing. 
-Are you fine?
[2005.16] Yes.
[2009.56] Come on.
[2010.52] Come to the room.
[2026.84] Yes, I did come to your house yesterday.
[2028.76] I came at Dua’s request. 
She called me.
[2031.16] Now,
[2033.72] if you want to know 
what we talked about there,
[2036.36] then the summary for it is that
[2038.76] we had an incomplete love 
and we want to complete it.
[2049.48] There is nothing to worry about.
[2051.44] This is good news.
[2058.48] What do you mean?
[2060.08] She is pregnant,
[2067.40] and you are going to be a father.
[2090.64] I will prescribe some medication,
[2093.08] you just give it to her on time.
[2105.60] And a healthy child will be 
added to your family.
[2118.12] I will take your leave now.
[2121.92] Take care of yourself.
