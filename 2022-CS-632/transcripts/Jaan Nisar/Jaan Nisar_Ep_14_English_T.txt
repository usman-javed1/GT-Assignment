[59.00] Sister?
[61.48] How are you?
[62.44] I am good.
[64.04] Greetings, brother Sarfaraz.
[66.56] Greetings.
[68.76] Won’t you come inside?
[71.40] Come, brother Sarfaraz.
[78.44] I tried when you asked me to,
[80.72] but there is no clue about that girl.
[82.36] I didn’t call you here to hear all this.
[85.68] Sir, the girl’s father 
refused to recognize her,
[89.16] and then that day 
Mr. M.P was visiting too,
[92.12] so with a lot of other girls,
[94.08] I released her as well,
[96.64] I don’t know where
 she went after that.
[99.80] That is all you could do?
[102.72] You came here to tell me
[103.80] you don’t know 
anything about that girl.
[105.64] After your call, I tried to trace her,
[109.28] I found out from her neighborhood
[111.16] that she did come
[113.08] but her father 
didn’t let her enter the house.
[116.64] No one knows where
 she went after that.
[118.88] So then find her.
[123.92] If she is not found,
[126.20] I will put your name in 
the list of missing people as well.
[129.32] Sir, I am trying…
[130.28] Enough.
[132.56] Let’s go, please.
[137.76] Sir.
[140.28] Jaffar, you may leave too.
[142.56] Yes, Sir.
[171.00] Greetings.
[189.76] Allow me to leave.
[192.20] Son,
[192.88] the tea is being made,
[193.80] at least have tea before leaving.
[195.84] I won’t have tea.
[197.96] I came inside because 
she insisted otherwise…
[203.32] Okay, as you wish.
[206.20] I will see him off.
[214.04] Listen,
[214.72] why don’t you stay for longer?
[222.64] I came to your house
 for the first time and
[224.04] did you see your father’s
 behavior with me?
[226.40] And you want me to 
sit here for longer.
[228.32] I guess Dad is upset because 
of the insult yesterday.
[234.88] So then let him be upset,
[236.80] he is behaving as if 
I made his daughter elope.
[241.24] You don’t mind his attitude,
[245.60] Dad doesn’t gel in with anyone,
[249.04] I wanted that when
 I come for the first time,
[253.32] he doesn’t leave disheartened.
[255.60] I am the one who felt bad and
[257.44] I won’t forget this insult,
[259.68] do you understand?
[262.08] Okay, listen,
[263.40] when will you come to pick 
me up in the evening?
[269.80] I was just asking so
 I stay ready in time,
[272.84] tell me when will you come?
[281.48] Never.
[312.44] Nosherwan…
[313.08] I am fine,
[315.36] I will do it myself.
[320.00] I am your wife.
[326.24] If I won’t take care of you,
[327.64] who else will?
[330.44] I can take care of myself,
[333.28] thank you.
[337.08] What happened?
[340.04] You are mad at everyone,
[341.92] you are even angry with Jaffar.
[350.08] I don’t consider 
it important to tell you.
[352.44] Why are you so 
mistrustful, Nosherwan?
[359.48] Husband and wife are
 each other’s clothes,
[362.92] secret from each other…
[363.76] You are wasting your time 
and mine as well.
[369.04] I can sacrifice my life 
for you Nosherwan,
[374.68] and you are talking about time?
[389.68] Why did the police
 come, Nosherwan?
[392.64] May I ask you?
[397.12] It will be better if you mind
 your own business,
[400.24] I am telling you very politely.
[406.56] You were taking some 
Dua’s name in your sleep,
[419.04] who is she?
[422.36] I am not answerable 
to anyone in this world.
[428.04] But I, I am your wife.
[431.24] Jaffar.
[437.00] Don’t call Jaffar, I will leave.
[444.56] Do have your soup.
[468.08] Sarfaraz is fine with you, right?
[470.68] I am the one who felt bad and
[472.24] I won’t forget this insult,
[473.84] do you understand?
[475.44] Where are you lost, sister?
[478.92] Where are you lost?
[482.96] Nowhere, why?
[485.04] Were you asking something?
[487.40] You don’t look like 
a newlywed bride at all.
[490.44] Why?
[491.04] Do I not look happy to you?
[500.36] Sarfaraz is fine with you?
[503.92] He is very nice to me.
[509.72] Whatever happened 
yesterday, sister,
[511.88] we were very worried 
for you after that.
[515.20] Why?
[516.40] Why were you worried?
[517.80] Hey, everyone takes very 
good care of me over there.
[524.76] It doesn't look like it by 
Aunt Kausar’s behavior.
[531.48] She heard it from
 somewhere all of a sudden so
[535.36] the poor woman
 reacted spontaneously,
[539.80] she is very nice by heart.
[547.60] Daughters even start 
lying after marriage.
[566.60] It has been so many days since 
I had tea made by Sania,
[570.40] and you just brought one cup,
[571.60] where is Mom?
[572.72] You have it.
[579.36] Where do we have to go, Sir?
[581.88] I don’t know myself, Jaffar.
[585.88] Wherever I can find out about Dua,
[589.64] let’s go there.
[591.08] Let’s go.
[616.00] Hi.
[622.44] I got this for you,
[624.92] look at this, a phone.
[628.04] I can't take this.
[630.60] Why not? Don’t you love me?
[633.80] I do but.
[635.88] But what?
[637.16] What will I tell at home?
[639.36] No one will know at home,
[641.36] you won’t tell anyone
[642.32] you have a phone
[644.20] and do you know,
[645.48] I will feel like talking to you 
more after meeting today,
[650.32] so now we cannot survive without this.
[655.48] How are you, sweetheart?
[656.76] What is this behavior?
[657.80] Ohhh! A new face.
[661.36] Fakhir,
[664.44] when did you come?
[668.80] Just right now.
[670.00] You could have told me before coming,
[671.60] why didn’t you call?
[672.92] I thought I would surprise you
[675.32] but I got a surprise when I came here…
[678.20] Uff...
[678.72] Fakhir, this is Dua,
[680.96] Dua this is my cousin, Fakhir.
[685.52] Okay.
[687.44] Actually, you are wearing my clothes
[690.00] so Fakhir got confused.
[692.32] I hope you don’t mind.
[696.52] Okay,
[697.28] you didn’t get ready yet,
[698.40] you had to go.
[700.64] Go, go, get ready.
[709.44] What do you do,
[710.08] we don’t have to tell her.
[712.24] You are mad.
[712.96] Hey, I didn’t know.
[827.36] People must be thinking
 you are very noble,
[830.72] but have you ever thought
[832.76] when I will yell and tell them
[835.88] what you have done to me,
[837.16] what will they think about you?
[843.76] What did I know
[847.68] that in search of freedom,
[850.72] Dua will show us this day one day?
[855.72] She was in search of freedom but
[858.92] she could never take this big step.
[862.56] My heart is not convinced
[864.80] that our Dua can do this.
[866.40] Sister, she kept on saying 
this while crying that
[869.96] we must listen to her
[872.32] and give her a chance to explain
[874.88] but Dad,
[876.40] Dad didn’t let us open the door.
[880.00] You guys should have 
given her a chance,
[881.80] at least you should have listened
 to her if she is a sinner or not.
[887.72] I tried,
[891.68] but your Dad…
[893.88] Yes,
[897.88] Dad shouldn’t have done this.
[900.88] Dus is his biological daughter,
[902.92] his own blood.
[905.64] How can he do this to her?
[908.28] I don’t know how my daughter must be.
[913.72] I have lost my sleep.
[920.00] It's so difficult to have
 patience when someone dies,
[924.40] how can I be patient on my Dua?
[931.64] Did you ask the neighbors?
[933.92] We might find out something about Dua,
[935.80] someone might have seen her going.
[937.64] Neighbors will do something
 only if they get done
[942.00] with defaming us and 
abusing my brought up.
[948.76] Then
[950.56] how will we find out 
about Dua like this?
[958.12] Sania, Dad, open the door.
[965.92] Wow, Mom,
[967.72] you can recognize 
Dad just by the knock
[972.44] and he couldn’t understand
 your emotions yet.
[977.08] You have started talking like Dua.
[979.72] Today, even I feel
[982.88] why wasn’t I bitter like Dua.
[986.76] I have told you 1000 times 
to open the door quickly.
[1000.44] Greetings, Dad.
[1005.40] You came back after two days?
[1008.56] Uncle said to go and
 meet your family.
[1014.24] What are you saying, Mr. Aslam?
[1017.84] Daughters do visit their parents’
 house after marriage and
[1021.12] it’s a tradition to come after 
the wedding reception.
[1023.88] I don’t believe in these rituals.
[1025.96] Understand
[1027.20] And tell her
[1028.56] not to come every other day
[1030.76] and stay at her home 
where we have sent her.
[1033.28] And listen to one more thing,
[1035.24] be thankful that I didn’t behave
 with your husband
[1036.88] the way I wanted to.
[1038.44] I should have thrown him out 
of my house after how they insulted me.
[1042.56] He is our son-in-law,
[1045.52] and we are parents of a daughter,
[1046.96] we have to tolerate all this.
[1048.12] Why do we have to tolerate it?
[1049.76] That’s why I used to tell you to
 give birth to boys, boys.
[1054.68] Now look,
[1055.68] how I have to face humiliation
 because of them.
[1059.96] And listen,
[1061.36] tea,
[1062.24] get tea for me in my room,
[1063.72] make it yourself.
[1066.40] Move!
[1075.76] Okay don’t worry
[1078.04] you know his temperament.
[1080.96] I am going to make tea for you Dad,
[1083.12] will you have it? 
Shall I make it for you?
[1085.08] Yes.
[1086.08] Hmm,
[1087.32] Sania, come sit here with your sister.
[1097.60] You don’t take Dad’s words personally,
[1101.44] you know he has this habit.
[1105.52] Since when did my little one 
become so sensible?
[1108.80] I had to.
[1111.80] You left and sister left too.
[1117.52] Dua had to go one day
[1121.96] but like this…
[1144.52] Yes, who are you
[1145.64] and who do you want to meet?
[1149.96] You?
[1151.12] You are the one
[1153.12] who fought with Dua in
 the parking of the mall?
[1158.40] Yes, I am the same.
[1160.40] Where is Dua?
[1162.20] What do I know where is she?
[1164.44] And why are you guys asking me?
[1169.40] Do you guys plan on
 taking revenge on her?
[1172.84] Just answer what 
you are being asked.
[1175.64] Where is Dua?
[1177.56] You are her friend,
[1178.48] you would know where she is.
[1179.96] I was her friend,
[1181.24] I am not anymore.
[1182.68] And by the way,
[1183.88] who stays friends with girls
[1185.56] who have no respect in society?
[1189.72] What does that mean?
[1190.92] I mean that's
[1192.52] how we talk about such a girl.
[1194.64] Thank you.
[1195.72] One minute.
[1198.20] You don’t know where she is?
[1201.60] Look,
[1202.68] I actually don’t know
[1203.84] where she is and 
what happened to her,
[1206.04] so please keep me
 out of this matter,
[1208.52] and don’t ever come here 
again to ask about her.
[1211.00] Thank you.
[1217.72] Jaffar, keep an eye on this girl,
[1220.76] she might know everything about Dua
[1222.56] and can be hiding it from us.
[1223.96] You are absolutely right.
[1245.88] Go and bring the daughter-in-law back.
[1248.48] I wanted to talk to you about
 something important.
[1250.40] First, bring her back then
[1252.00] I will listen to your 
important thing as well.
[1271.32] Greetings.
[1274.44] Let’s go.
[1276.36] Sit inside for a while.
[1278.28] I have come to pick you up,
[1280.24] so let’s go now.
[1281.92] Who is it, Fiza?
[1283.72] Umm.
[1285.84] Greetings.
[1287.52] Greetings,
[1288.76] why are you standing outside, son,
[1289.88] come inside.
[1291.28] No, I am in a bit of a rush.
[1295.28] So, you guys first eat and then go,
[1297.24] it’s time for dinner.
[1298.60] I won’t have food.
[1300.24] Some other time.
[1302.00] I will just take the veil and come.
[1304.32] I am waiting outside.
[1335.44] Your job has been arranged.
[1338.32] There is no need for an interview 
when I have spoken to them,
[1342.56] Seth Raees just wants 
to meet you once,
[1347.00] he wants to meet you for his
 own satisfaction to see
[1349.56] that since I have
 praised you so much,
[1352.16] are you even up to 
his standards or not?
[1356.64] He has arranged a meeting at his
 house so you don’t have to wait for longer.
[1362.40] Ma’am Zunaira has sent you, right?
[1369.72] I just told you.
[1371.36] Okay, fine.
[1396.40] Who is calling?
[1400.52] Madam.
[1404.24] Yes, madam?
[1406.32] Is everything okay?
[1408.12] I hope she is not making 
any noise, right?
[1409.84] Yes,
[1410.92] everything is fine for now.
[1413.96] She is a new bird,
[1414.68] be careful and stay vigilant.
[1417.32] Don’t worry.
[1419.04] If she makes much noise,
[1421.64] don’t give her any leverage.
[1423.48] Yes, whatever you command.
[1436.60] May I come in, Sir?
[1438.00] Come in.
[1461.92] Why has this door been closed?
[1463.92] Open the door.
[1466.04] Don’t make noise.
[1467.36] Open the door.
[1468.48] Come to me.
[1473.28] Open the door.
[1488.56] Open the door.
[1495.88] I am not that bad, sweetheart.
[1509.92] What happened, Sir?
[1511.04] What happened?
[1512.68] What happened, Sir?
[1514.04] What happened to you? Sir?
[1519.56] Sir?
[1540.32] Hey, hey where are you going?
[1542.64] Leave my hand,
[1543.48] leave me, let me go.
[1545.16] Hey, take out the car.
[1546.32] Please leave me.
[1548.76] What kind of a girl has madam sent?
[1550.32] She injured Sir.
[1552.40] We have to take him to the hospital.
[1554.04] And do tell your madam,
[1555.72] we will ask her when we come back.
[1570.56] That’s it, I will take it,
[1572.04] I will take it. I have hands.
[1587.72] You forgot to add salt.
[1590.08] Where are you lost when 
you are cooking?
[1592.76] What are you thinking?
[1594.52] You forgot.
[1595.92] I guess I forgot.
[1597.84] I should eat it as is?
[1598.92] No, I will just add in it.
[1601.36] No, I don’t want to have it.
[1602.56] This experimental food you cook,
[1604.64] feed it to your daughters and yourself.
[1607.04] Pick it up, I don’t want to have it.
[1610.36] What happened?
[1611.64] Do you want to say something?
[1613.92] Quickly say it.
[1615.84] I will say it but
[1619.44] promise me you won’t get angry.
[1622.40] I won’t make such promise.
[1624.48] Say what you want to
[1625.92] and if you don’t want to
 say it then don’t say it.
[1628.72] So, you should have 
found out about Dua.
[1633.92] God knows how 
my daughter must be.
[1636.84] You took that shameless 
girl’s name again?
[1638.76] Who defamed 
me in the whole city.
[1642.04] For God’s sake Mr. Aslam,
[1644.84] have mercy on that unfortunate,
[1648.32] at least find out where she is.
[1651.40] Why should I ask her?
[1653.52] Hey is there any greater
 reason than disobedience?
[1657.80] You cannot even imagine, 
Fehmida Begum
[1660.16] all that I had to hear at 
the police station the other day,
[1663.32] why didn’t I die of shame?
[1666.92] My heart says Dua is innocent.
[1669.00] You like to place burning 
coals in your hand,
[1673.68] I don’t.
[1674.92] She is dead for me
[1676.24] and the dead never gets alive.
[1678.76] I spared her this time
[1680.48] but if she comes in 
front of me ever again,
[1682.68] I will strangle her myself,
[1685.40] take this away
[1691.48] otherwise I will throw it.
[1697.00] I work all day and I don’t even 
get a meal in a day.
[1710.32] Did I shelter you for this day?
[1713.24] That’s how you are 
going to reward me?
[1715.56] Had I known you 
are such a bad woman,
[1717.64] I would have never 
taken favor from you.
[1722.72] I will make you pay back
 for my favors with interest,
[1726.80] do you understand?
[1729.04] I will die
[1730.56] but I won’t do what you 
are asking me to do,
[1732.40] I will never do it.
[1733.20] Even your father will do it,
[1735.64] you just need to lose your ego.
[1739.44] When you will stay 
hungry for a few days,
[1742.40] you would even get
 ready to eat the dead.
[1749.16] Be afraid of God’s wrath,
[1752.20] aren’t you scared of God?
[1754.72] You have betrayed me.
[1757.12] You have betrayed me.
[1759.80] For God’s sake.
[1760.56] Take her away.
[1762.64] Come.
[1763.20] I am asking you to take her away.
[1765.24] Leave me,
[1766.16] leave me, leave my hand,
[1768.00] have some fear of God.
[1774.16] Leave me.
[1776.24] Umm,
[1777.20] what do you think,
[1779.12] will she agree?
[1786.00] Zunaira has fixed big people,
[1790.52] did you forget
[1792.72] you weren’t that easily 
convinced either?
[1799.96] For now,
[1801.44] I am just worried about Sir’s anger.
[1806.84] He is such a huge builder,
[1807.72] I wanted to get land
 from him and this girl…
[1810.40] she broke his head and
 ruined everything I did.
[1814.40] You get lost too!
[1828.04] I will see how she won’t agree.
[1831.40] Zunaira.
[1838.00] Open it. Open it.
[1841.28] Don’t lock me here. Open it,
[1844.12] open me, please.
[1846.48] Open it. I won’t live here.
[1849.40] Take me out.
[1854.20] Take me out, please, take me out.
[1865.52] Where did you go, Dua?
[1879.04] Shall I get you food?
[1881.20] I am not hungry.
[1885.00] You will have to eat
[1886.84] because you have to take medicines.
[1890.24] I said I am not hungry.
[1892.68] How won’t you eat food?
[1894.72] You cannot have medicine
 on an empty stomach.
[1896.88] Why don’t you
 understand at once?
[1899.68] Why are you after my life?
[1900.60] I said I am not hungry,
[1901.52] it means I am not hungry.
[1910.12] What is it, Nosherwan?
[1913.56] You went somewhere 
during the day as well.
[1917.84] Are you worried?
[1919.04] Yes, I am
[1921.28] and who can know the reason
 for my worry better than you?
[1929.52] Go away from here.
[1984.28] Sister-in-law,
[1985.40] you must rest for now.
[1989.44] This is not a very tough job,
[1991.52] we will do it together.
[1993.12] I won’t let you do any work 
without you making the rice pudding first.
[1996.04] Then you can work
 later on and I will rest.
[1998.92] Okay.
[2000.36] You can rest then,
[2001.92] in fact, why then? Rest from now only.
[2005.00] Oh ho, I have to do this as well.
[2008.12] Come on, let’s go.
[2012.56] Listen,
[2015.32] here is the list of groceries,
[2018.16] we are out of groceries at home,
[2020.84] send it through someone.
[2023.40] We already have a person more to eat.
[2028.04] Sometimes you talk rubbish,
[2031.84] it hasn’t been many days since 
daughter-in-law came to this house
[2035.00] and you started counting her bites?
[2037.76] I just generally said it
[2039.96] but I am noticing
[2041.60] you don’t hear a word
against daughter-in-law,
[2044.72] I don’t know what have I said
[2046.60] that you have disliked so much.
[2052.88] Dad,
[2056.20] I wanted to talk to you 
about something important.
[2058.44] Yes, yes, listen to him as well,
[2061.48] he has been looking for 
you since yesterday,
[2063.08] I don’t know what is so important.
[2066.20] Okay, hurry up and speak, 
I have to get to the shop.
[2071.52] I want to divorce Fiza.
[2077.88] Are you out of your mind?
[2080.32] Are you mad?
[2082.44] Do you hear yourself 
what you are saying?
[2084.64] I know very well 
what I am saying,
[2087.84] I want to divorce Fiza.
[2093.36] But why?
[2095.48] Why?
[2097.32] You are still asking that question.
[2100.32] Didn’t you see what they 
did to us at the wedding?
[2104.24] Didn’t their reality 
reveal in front of us?
[2106.24] Whatever has happened,
[2108.08] who told you that this 
is all Fiza’s fault?
[2112.68] Whose younger sister is like that,
[2114.96] how she would be herself?
[2117.48] What rubbish are you talking about?
[2121.00] It hasn’t even been two 
days to your wedding
[2123.72] and you are talking about divorce?
[2125.16] Enough Dad. I have decided.
[2126.88] I don’t accept any 
such decision of yours.
[2130.04] How is this justified
[2131.40] that you punish your wife 
for someone else’s doings?
[2135.28] Both of them have been 
brought up in the same house,
[2137.56] they would even be of 
the same nature.
[2139.48] In fact, we don’t even know 
what she must be doing.
[2142.04] I think you have
 watched some movie
[2144.12] that is why you are saying all this.
[2145.72] Are you listening to what he is saying?
[2148.80] He is right,
[2150.88] what will people say,
[2152.44] they just got married
 had a reception
[2155.32] and now we get a news 
of divorce from their house?
[2157.84] What will people think?
[2158.88] You guys don’t 
care about your son.
[2160.88] What has happened to you
[2163.56] that you have come to such 
an extreme decision?
[2166.44] And then you are
 asking us to support you.
[2168.96] I don’t want to keep any relation 
with a family whose daughters are…
[2172.68] Okay enough!
[2173.76] Maybe,
[2175.84] what is their younger
 daughter’s name? That…
[2177.96] Yeah, Dua.
[2179.72] Dua might be completely innocent,
[2183.28] some guy must have taken 
advantage of her innocence,
[2187.56] and she might not be at fault.
[2189.48] Then what will you say?
[2192.04] Dad, whatever it is,
[2193.28] this relationship won’t work out.
[2195.72] This is my final decision.
[2197.00] Enough!
[2197.96] I don’t want to hear a word more.
[2201.32] I am trying to make you
 understand and you…
[2205.32] You won’t take any such step
[2208.68] and if you did something like that,
[2211.88] I would be the worst to you.
[2214.32] Do you understand?
[2222.92] Don’t you worry, daughter,
[2227.04] I am with you.
