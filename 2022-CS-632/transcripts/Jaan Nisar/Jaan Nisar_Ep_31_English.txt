Thank you. Did you feel happy meeting your sister? Okay, let’s do one thing. I will also go with you tomorrow, we will go meet your sister. But, she didn’t give me her address. So, when is difficult to find the address? Yes. But, can you find out the address? Yes, if you ask me, it will take me two minutes to get it. Okay. Let’s go to her place, tomorrow. In fact, do one thing, don’t inform her. We will surprise her. In fact, she gave you her phone number, right? Yes. I have her number. But she said 
she would contact me herself. So, no issue, you call her first. It makes no difference. Okay no, don’t call. We will go to meet her directly. No, I think it will not look good like this. First, let me talk to her. We will plan something and then go. Fine, as you wish. Fiza. Fiza. You are here? You didn’t call, that’s why. Call? I… What happened? Is there a problem? You have an idea
about her worries, right? This world and its fears don't
even let us breathe freely. My in-laws, Papa. Dua, please forgive me. You know, after you went missing, we were very worried. But now, seeing you so happy like
this in your life, you know, we can only pray for you, but we cannot meet you, Dua. We cannot meet you. Will we stop living out
of the fear of people, or will we stop our own? I am helpless, Dua. I am really helpless. Fine. If it is so, then I will not force you. But, can you do me a favor? Make me meet Mama once, man. If…if… if she doesn’t want to meet me, then I will never show
you people my face. I swear, I will never show you my face. But once… please, make me
meet Mama and Sania once. Please. Fine, I will do something. Come quickly, Mama, Sania. Hey, Fiza, child, you should
have said no to Dua. I tried, but she just wants to meet
you once, meet her. What is the point of talking now? Come on. What times have come, we have to meet our
own daughter like a thief. Mama, come quickly. What if Papa comes? Yes, that’s why
I am calling out to you. Come quickly. Where are you people going? Where are you going? And you. Did I not tell you not to come here? Where are you taking
your mother and sister? We… We were going to the doctor. Sania was not well. Really? Then why did you
not go yourself? Why did you call her? She will go to her in-laws
home from there, and we will visit the doctor. Okay. Okay fine, come soon. Sure. Yes. Come on, give it.
Give me the keys. Come on. Cover your face. Yes. And you, Sania. Lower your gaze and go. Dua. Mama. Where did you go leaving all of us? I made a mistake. A really big mistake. I made a mistake. I had strayed from
the path you showed me, so all this was bound
to happen to me. There is no point in crying
and cribbing now, child. Who was that damned person? Whoever he was, he just wanted to ruin me, and did so too, but God had something else planned. He saved me. Ghaznavi is really good. He also cares for me a lot. You got married and we couldn’t even
come to your wedding. Alright, I will take your
complaint to Ghaznavi, then we will see what he says. No, there is no need
to talk about this. He gave you respect, he married you, My burning heart is
finally finding some relief. May God protect you
from the evil eye. May He give you a lot of happiness. You know, I had everything. Only your prayers were lacking. Thank you, Fiza. I am so, so, so happy today, that I cannot tell you. There is no need to tell me. I can read your face. I know. I am really expressive, right? I cannot hide anything. Everything comes to
the face itself. The truth always comes on the faces
of honest and straightforward people. That’s why I love you. When are you making me
meet your Mama and sisters? I won't be able to do that. Papa’s anger is really bad. If he finds out, it will be really bad. Hmmm. So, first, introduce me
to your Papa. It is possible his thinking
will change after meeting me. No. No. if you meet him, then he will also consider you
responsible for my mistake. He will say something
for no reason, I don’t want that. No issue. I will hear it. I can do anything for you. But, Mama and Sania… you know, Fiza is married, but God knows what he will
do with Mama and Sania. I cannot do this. Hmmm. If this is the case that
we cannot go there, and we cannot meet
them there, then invite them here. What? Really? Can I invite them here? Of course, it is your own home. You can invite whoever
you want here. Who will stop you? Thank you. You are always welcome. Sir, I want two… No, it won’t be possible today. Hey man, he is such
an arrogant man. What was this? I will have to do
something to be noticed. No matter how
much you bow down, people like him will never notice us. That is not true. You will see, one day he will remember
my name well. It will take some time for
that moment to arrive. Right now go and do your work. Do your work. Yes. Sir, we are constantly getting
calls from the Zani group for a meeting. Fine, you give them
time for tomorrow. Okay, sure, sir. You're humiliating me
for that cheap girl. Everyone knows where
you brought her from. Don’t you dare. if you speak a little
nonsense about Dua, then I will forget that I have ever had
a relationship with you. You have made her stand
right next to me. You will have to hear it. I am making you
understand for the last time, stay away from me. And I too have told you, I have lost you once, I cannot lose you again. I love you. We will surely come to your home. I really want to see sister’s home, where you are
living like Cinderella. You come and stay
over at my home. Really? Yes. Yes. There is no need. You stay happy. And then we met you yesterday, we even met today, and we will continue to meet you like this. We are happy about this. But, why Mama? Child, you know your Papa. Mama is right, Dua. All of us have forgiven
you with our hearts. But this world is not
ready to forgive you, and Papa and my in-laws
top that list. After all that I went through, why are these people
doing this with me? That’s how you think, these earthly gods
don’t think this way. Mama, will you stop meeting me
because of the fear of society? How will I spend such a big
life without you people? Child, we too are helpless. You… you don’t worry about Papa. I will convince Papa. If not sooner,
than later, he will agree. Papa. Papa? Mama, come on. Let’s go home, child. We will have to go home, Dua. When I have told you not to, then why are you calling
me again and again? What do you want to make me
understand by ignoring my call? That I don’t want to talk to you. Okay. Can I ask you the reason? I don't want to have any
ties with you anymore. Whatever was between
us in the past, it's over now. Why don’t you understand? That’s how you feel, but not me. You know, doing this you are only wasting your and my time. That’s it. Right now, I am just
wasting time, Ghaznavi. But if you don’t come
here in half an hour, then I will come to your office, and not just that, after that, I will go to your home and meet Dua. And this time I will not come back silently. Do you get it? I am waiting for you. Jaffar. What is the purpose of calling me
like this through blackmail? You find my love to be blackmailing? It is nothing less than that either. Why don’t you understand me? I cannot live without you, Ghaznavi. I only belong to Dua. You don’t understand this. See, I will also accept Dua. Please. Please, just accept me once. It is not possible now. How is it not possible? Who can restrain you? I have put this restraint on myself. See yourself, you know, I love you so much. The two of us will live really
happily with each other. I made a big mistake coming here. I should leave. You cannot go from here. Leave me. Fine. If you leave me and go today, then you will have to come to carry
my corpse on your shoulders. Farah, have you gone mad? What did you do? Farah. Farah, Farah, listen to me. Farah, open your eyes. I had told you, if I don’t get you, I will die. Farah, what is this madness? Farah, open your eyes. Farah, open your eyes. Open your eyes. What is this madness, Farah? Is someone here? Farah. Farah, open your eyes. What game are you mother and
daughters playing under my nose? What is going on here? I had told you not to meet her. I had to tell you, that… When did you have to tell me? After my death? You cannot treat Mama like this. You be quiet. All this happened because of you. You come here all the time. Go to your home. And you? When I told you that no
one would meet that girl, then how did you meet? Fehmida Begum, you forgot what I had told you. I had told you, if you meet her, then I… For God’s sake. For God’s sake, care for my age a little. You didn’t do good, going
against my decision. You will have to suffer
the punishment for it. Mr. Aslam, why do you forget? Why do you forget that I am also a mother? If you’re a mother,
remain a mother. Because you couldn’t
fulfill the role of a wife. There is no place for
you in this home, Fehmida Begum. Fehmida Begum, I divorce… Papa, come to your senses,
what are you doing? Be quiet. Mama, go inside. Mama, go inside. Come on. Fehmida Begum. Who is it? You? What are you doing here? I came to tell you that don’t say anything to, Mama. I was the one who
insisted on meeting her. Who are you to tell me this? She is my wife. I can do anything I want. Get lost from here. I am your daughter, and you cannot even deny this
relationship after you die. You are not my daughter. A wayward girl like you can
never be my daughter. Madam has said that she has come to
meet her mother, so she will meet her and go. Neither can you close the
door on my face today nor drag me out. You had dragged me out of here,
out of the fear of these people, right? You closed the door on my face. Today, does anyone
have the courage to raise a finger at me? Does anyone have the
courage to come in front of me? None of them dare to raise
fingers at me, Papa. She is my mother. My mother and my sisters live here. Not once, I will come here again and again, and no one will have
the courage to stop me. And if you ever mistreat them again, I swear, I swear to God, Papa, I won’t spare you either. Is there a spectacle going on here? Go do your work. Please try to understand, I cannot live without you. Please try to understand. You know how much I love you. Please. Please, say something. Please, marry me. You find my love to be blackmailing? It is nothing less than that either. Why don’t you understand me? I cannot live without you, Ghaznavi. I only belong to Dua. You don’t understand this. See, I will also accept Dua. Please. Please, just accept me once. It is not possible now. How is it not possible? Who can restrain you? Mama. My beloved
Mama, stop now. Why are you crying now, Mama? You should be happy now. See, even sister is with us. The little one is absolutely right. What is there to cry about now? Take out whatever fear you
have for Papa in your heart. He will not say
anything to you now. What was the need for you
to argue with your father? I have not argued. He wanted a son, I have shown that I can be a son. You silenced Papa. You have become really brave, sister. I…I…I am really afraid of Mr. Aslam’s silence. The one who has supported you this far will continue to do so in the future as well. Listen to me. Whatever fear you have in your heart, take it out. You don’t need to
be afraid of anyone, because your daughters
are standing with you. No one can say anything to you. No. No. No. Mama. Mama. Tell her… No. And if you fear that
Papa will divorce you, or he will say something
like this to you, then you don’t need to be afraid. Don’t be afraid of anyone. We are all with you, Mama. We are all with you. Your daughters are with you. A weak man only has one weapon that he uses on his wife. Listen, I have a headache. Won’t you get me tea? And if there are biscuits, then bring them too. I will just bring it. Will you have tea? Will you have tea? Will you have tea? Dua is here, we will drink it happily with her. Right? Now you people have an idea, right? Sir, we didn’t know this
was Mr. Ghaznavi’s matter. Had we known,
we wouldn’t have come. The hospital called that it
was a matter of suicide. That’s why we came. Hmm. You know now, right? Yes, absolutely. Please. Doctor, how is she now? She is fine now. Thank you. She is fine now. This news shouldn’t reach your Madam. It won’t, sir. Dua.... After fifteen days, our Fiza will go to her home. Hey, they are such good people, they have also given sweets. And our Fiza is pretty, right? There is no doubt about this. Sister is really pretty. Okay, on this note, have some sweets. Yes. Yes. But how will we make
preparations so soon? Man, please don’t scare me. I also have to get
my clothes stitched. Dua, you are not new in this home. When you are aware of
Papa’s temperament. So don’t give him
a chance like that. He just wants an opportunity to remind Mom of everything,
past and present. Okay, I will be careful. Listen, come with me to Mama. Put in a little request, please. Come. Love.
