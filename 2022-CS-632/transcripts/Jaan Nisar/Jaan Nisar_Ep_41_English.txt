I didn’t know you people were coming. And he didn’t tell me anything either. Surprises are not discussed. When Nosherwan called
us to tell us about you, he sent the car as well. Then we couldn’t stop ourselves. How are you now? Thanks to The Almighty, I am much better. But you people bothered for no reason. Hey, what bothered? We got worried when we heard
about your well-being. That is why we came. Come on, let’s have breakfast
and do the remaining talks there. Please, come. Hey, we already had breakfast. We just came when we heard about it. We had breakfast, right? Yes. Look, if you won’t have breakfast with us, she won’t eat properly too. Please, come. Your house looks exactly like a palace. Hmm Have breakfast, then I will show you around. Really? Yes. Come on Here you go. Your favourite. Please have something. Dua, ask them. Maybe then
they will take something. Let me serve myself. No, child. Eat your breakfast, you are unwell. We will take ourselves. Do you know, Ghaznavi? I used to bother my mother
more than anyone else. I used to tease her over
every meal all the time. But my mother always used to take great care of me. She never complained. A mother is never bothered, child. I am happy that God has blessed you
with more than you used to wish for. Undoubtedly, God has blessed me more
than I wished for. You could have brought Fiza too. I am sorry, I didn’t have Fiza or her husband’s number. Otherwise, I would have directly invited her. Dua would have liked it even
more if Fiza had come too. If you don’t mind, give me Fiza or her husband’s number so that we don’t have any trouble next time. I will invite her directly. I am sorry. 
Did I say something wrong? No, no, son. You didn’t say anything wrong. Actually, her in-laws don’t like it much. What do they not like? Actually, the day Dua left,
it was Fiza’s wedding. We just tried to wed off our other daughter
to save ourselves from defamation. And Fiza’s in-laws got to
know about this thing. That is why they are bothering us. And his in-laws… I mean Fiza’s in-laws don’t treat
her right due to this. Why mention something that is gone? Dua is my wife now. Fiza’s in-laws should have
nothing to do with Dua’s past. The mistake Dua made, made us all suffer. But thankfully, Dua found you. My Fiza… My Fiza is being punished for
something she never did. Why don’t you talk to them? I mean why are you silent? If you say, I will talk to Fiza’s in-laws. I will ask them what is wrong? No, no, son. Don’t talk to them. We will talk to them ourselves
at the right moment. Yes. Actually, we have not told
them about you and Dua. They believe that maybe
we still haven’t found Dua. Hey, what are we talking about? We should be worried about Dua. She is unwell. Why do you bother the poor man? No, since you guys are here now, Dua will be fine. Yes. You bothered so much. Hey, now give us permission to go. No, Uncle. If you stayed, then we would have dinner together. No, no, man. You served us twice. That’s enough now You fed us really good food. We will go now, son. Dua now feels better as you people came. You will come again, right? May God keep you have happy and safe from evil eyes. Amen. Now, get well soon and
come to our house with brother Nosherwan. Now just consider her well. Okay, son. Shall we go now? Yes, sure. Jaffar? They shouldn’t face any trouble. Sure, don’t worry. Goodbye. Come, please come. Hey, greetings. Yes, yes. Greetings. Did you guys go somewhere? There was a relative who was so sick. We went to see him. Really? Who is this relative about
whom I don’t know? We have so many relatives. How many would you know? By the way, this is astonishing. You have got such a rich relative who has got such a car,
and I don’t know about him. Son, come inside. Let’s sit and talk. Come inside. No, I will go now. I just came to invite you. Sumbul is getting married. Hmm I will come in the evening to pick her up. She will give you the invitation. I will go now. Tea, have tea. No, I have some work. He is in such a hurry. Come, I will tell you. Sumbul is getting married. Okay, may God bless her. Okay, then. Bye. Come, child. Come, come on. Come on, my children. Come. Hey, now give her tea. Child, take this. Until Sarfaraz comes to pick me up, I am here. Actually, Sumbul is
getting married this Friday. I came here to invite you all for that. May God bless her. Come, child. She will
have tea before going. I will send it through the children. My daughter won’t just have tea. Father, if you would talk to me
with such love and affection, then I don’t need anything else. Child, you have come now.. Okay, child, I am getting
late for evening prayers. Let me come back after
offering prayers, okay? Don’t go anywhere. Our father has changed a lot, right? Come, come in. Thanks to the Almighty. Mother? You all went to Dua’s place, is everything alright there? Thankfully, everything is fine. Dua fell a little sick, so Nosherwan called us all there. What happened to her? She met me yesterday,
and she was fine. She just had fever. She is fine now. Okay, thank God. Honestly speaking, child. Seeing Nosherwan’s love
and attention for Dua, I was satisfied. God has blessed her with such a nice husband and such a nice house. Sister’s house is so beautiful. I was awestruck. And Sister showed me her house. And brother Nosherwan
was so hospitable. He was not even letting us leave. He was saying that
we should go after having dinner. Well, that’s good. Dua is happy in her house, this is what’s making us happy, right? yes. He was also asking about you. He was saying if he had Fiza or her
husband’s contact number, he would have invited them too. We ignored it considering
Sarfaraz’s temperament. Otherwise, Nosherwan was asking
for your number. No, you did right that you ignored it. Sarfaraz won’t understand it. I was scared myself.
I still haven’t told him about Dua. I don’t understand what is
wrong with brother Sarfaraz? Why is he so arrogant? He is nothing as compared
to brother Nosherwan. Still, you have met brother Nosherwan, right? He is so nice. And then there is brother Sarfaraz. I swear I don’t feel related to him ever. It feels like we are his servants,
and he is our master. Sania? You speak nonsense. Go, make tea for your sister. Don’t scold her now. Sorry Sister. You didn’t say anything wrong.
Why are you saying sorry? She is a child. Hmm.. She just said that uselessly. Dua? Why did you bother? I would have taken it myself. There should be some
change sometimes. Really? Are you fine now? You have done a lot for me. How can I not get well? By the way, you scared me. You get scared too? Yes. I fear losing you. Won’t you tell me
why you were worried? Did Fiza say something? No. Look, if Fiza’s in-laws don’t want to meet us, then why did they become so important that you are taking stress for them? You don’t need to take stress for anyone. You are Nosherwan’s life. Even if someone points out his finger at you, I will cut his hand away. You are my God’s gift to me. Sometimes, I don’t understand how to thank the Lord. I wanted to fill my life with sand, but my Lord was supposed to
fill my life with treasures. I found you, and my life is filled with treasures. When you and father were talking about my sin, I felt like sinking down with shame. I made a mistake. I made a huge mistake. Cry some.. You will be at peace. Tea. I am hungry, bring me food. My parents asked you. You could have stayed and eaten there but you left from outside. Will I eat food at your home? It is forbidden for me to even
drink water from your house. Do you understand? Let me bring something for you to eat. Wait. Yes? Such a big car dropped your family. What is going on? Nothing. You have such rich relatives, and I don’t know them. Hmm? They are distant relatives, from father's side. We don’t see them often. No, no, no. There is something else. That is it. The day I will get to know the reality, you will not be treated right that day. You will see what I will do with you. What are you looking at? Go. Sure. Who is this party? I should investigate. Hey, you seem so happy today. You are getting your first salary. Yes. Then you will give us treat, right? Sure. Yes, your salary is ready. Here is your salary. This is your cheque. Sign on it. Didn’t you deduct some extra money? You took off days, so your
salary will surely be deducted. No, that I know. I only took two to three days off. You deducted this much money. Not two to three days, you took five off days. Okay, I took five days off but
do some amendments. Look, I have done as much as I could. Anything more is not possible. What do you mean it is not possible? Make it possible. What ill-behaviour is this? What is happening there? What is the issue? Sir, his salary was deducted
due to his leaves, that is why he is making noise. Pay him the whole month’s
salary and fire him. Sure sir. Sir, have a seat. I will see. Sir, I accept I have taken leaves, but I deserve this job. Please. Please give me another chance. Bring his file to my room. Sure, sir. Come inside. First month and five leaves? Yes, sir. There were some emergencies at home. Your CV shows that
you are a needy person. Even after being needy, you are showing such irresponsibility. Sir, there were some personal issues. Mister, we all have personal issues. But before coming to the office, we drop those personal issues outside. Yes, yes. I will be more careful now. Even your progress report
is not satisfactory. Sir, actually, it was my first month. I was learning and
understanding my tasks. But you won’t face any
trouble from my side now. Hmm. Okay, we will give you another chance but don’t do it next time. Yes, sir. Now go do your work. One more thing, along with personal issues, keep your attitude outside the office. My son is one in a million. May God bless. He is so nice. Sumbul and Khizar
would look so good together. Sumbul is your
daughter’s sister-in-law, right? Yes. What is her temperament? She is so nice. She treats my daughter like her sisters. By the way, you have met her, right? Yes. There is a difference in meeting someone
and living with someone, aunt. Hey, sister. When the earning son falls in love and asks for marriage, we cannot say no. Now we don’t want to lose him. Only my God knows how I am burdened with two daughters and am still here to wed off my son. I will be right back. Fiza? Yes, mother? Child, Khizar’s mother and
sisters are so weird. They were asking
me such weird questions. Actually, Khizar’s sisters
are older than him, and he is getting married
before them so it is obvious they must
be feeling a little something. That is right,
but our Sumbul is so nice. Will she be able to live with them? Sumbul knows everything. Khizar is also mature. That is why he has put the condition that once his sisters get married, only then he will proceed with the reception. Sumbul also understands. And Khizar is also mature. Well, I hope this happens. It is about a daughter. It’s scary as we don’t know
how people turn out to be. You just pray. Everything will be fine. My daughter is looking so beautiful. You are standing here talking, and I asked to you see
if Sumbul is ready or not. Hmm? I was about to go. Wait. Come here. Tell me one thing. Are you getting married? What? No, actually… If you are not getting married, then why are you looking like this? I swear, you are looking
so bad right now. And go remove this lipstick. Sure, let me go do that. Hun.. Who asked you to talk to
Khizar so joyfully like that? I didn’t talk to him. So that means am I lying? Yes? What I saw was a lie? I am speaking the truth. I was doing chores all the time. I saw you myself. You were laughing and talking to him. Are you denying me? I just congratulated him
at the time of marriage Okay, so if you wouldn’t congratulate him,
he wouldn’t have gotten married? Ask Sumbul, I didn’t say another
word after congratulating them. I don’t need anyone’s testification. I have my own eyes. This ominous face
that you keep in front of me, as soon as another
man comes in front of you, you start smiling. And people feel like I torture you, but the reality is that women like you
are happy with other men. You are doing injustice. Khizar is like my brother. Hey, stop it. “Khizar is like my brothers” … I understand everything. I am not like this. Don’t you realize that yet? Listen to me. No need to talk nonsense with me,
do you understand? And just understand one thing, if I found you closer to him, I will shoot you.
