Zulekha, are you fine? Yes, Saeen. I told you if you call me to your home 
without my will, then you will see your end 
will your own eyes. I told you, right? Hey, Ghaznavi, it is done now, forgive me. Ghaznavi never forgives those 
who disrespect women. Your hands should be disabled so that you never lay a hand on 
a woman's honor again. Come on. Why are you going here? Don’t you 
want to take the last class? I am in no mood and, please, 
you too sit here quietly. After all, I have taken three classes 
because of you today. So? We took classes after 
such a long time, or else, we just come here, chat and go back home. Yes, so who comes to 
the university to study? And then people like us who were 
burdened by school and college, only come to the university to enjoy. Yes, if the attendance register 
reaches home one day, then we will know. Papa will scold me so much, and it is possible that he will not waste
 a minute in taking me out of here. Forget your father for a little while,
someday, when leaving home. Please. I cannot forget him, and even if I try to forget him, I remember everything after 
hearing papa scream as soon as I enter home. I told you, I had to face the loss
of the radio yesterday. Leave all this, look at this. The girl has danced so well. Who is this? She is my friend. Your friend is so rich? Yes. Earlier, she used to live 
in our neighborhood, then later on, her father and brother 
started sending money from abroad, and these people changed 
their neighborhood. Now, tomorrow is her 
brother’s marriage. She is so pretty. Right?
Yes. And look at her dress, 
it looks so nice. You are so lucky, you have such a rich friend. Going to such functions is 
just a dream for me. If you want, I can fulfill this dream of yours. How? The wedding is tomorrow. 
Come with me. How can I go? What will I say at home? Why do you need to tell 
anyone at home? Just say you're going to the university and then come to my place. And we’ll get ready there and 
then we’ll head out. Oh man, it’s a daytime wedding, right? We’ll be free from there anyway 
before evening. But I don’t even have any suitable 
clothes for such events. You don’t worry about the clothes, I have a lot. 
You just agree and we will go together. We will have a lot of fun. What are you thinking? Here, you too put it on. Should we kill our desires because 
of the restrictions of the family? Hey, come on, put it on. Clean it on your way home. Now, if the family doesn’t 
like us dressing up, then what can we do? Here, apply it. here you go. Apply it. You are right. I feel really anxious, 
shall we go back? Dua, please stand with me quietly. Do I look overdressed? You have put on a lot of 
makeup on me, today. You are getting confused 
for no reason. You look really pretty. 
What is wrong? Trust me. Hi. Thank God you are here. How could I not come? After seeing the video 
you sent me yesterday, I decided I had to see your 
live performance today. Sure. Err… This? This is Dua. My classmate. Hi. 
Hi. Okay, hurry up. The performance is going to start. 
Be quick. Come quickly. Yes, come on. 
Come on. She is even prettier than the video. It is all the magic of money. 
Come on. It is better that you go on stage 
instead of standing here, and move your feet. Are you crazy? Hey, what is wrong?
It is just family. Nothing will happen,
come on. Not at all. I won't be able to do it.
There are so many people. There's no choreographer or 
expert here to judge you. Come on. 
No, please, no. No. I am with you too, come on. 
No. No. No. No. Come on. Come on. 
We are really late. I will even get scolded at home 
if I tell them I had an extra class. We are not late at all. We will go home. 
What is the hurry? I have to go to your home 
and change as well. Hey, everything will be done. Tell me, did you enjoy it?
A lot. Greetings. Greetings. 
Stop. Why do you come back late, daily? No. Did I talk to you? Be quiet. Speak up. I had an extra class, today,
 so I got late. Where did the earrings
 come from? Where did you get 
these earrings from? Rida. They belong to Rida. She gave them to me to try 
but I forgot to remove them. Do you see, Fehmida, your daughter doesn’t go 
to the university, she goes to a fashion show. I forgot to remove them, sorry. I will return them tomorrow. 
Sorry. Sorry. Yes, Fehmida, you couldn’t give me a son, but you gave me this foolish child, now take care of her. I saw a smile on your face
 after so long, I liked it. Hmm. If you want, should I find out 
about that girl? I am sorry. Not right now, Jaffar. Right now, let me analyze, that whether she is really 
a good girl or did I find her to be good. Sure, Saeen. You almost got me killed yesterday. I got saved from Papa, then Mama scolded me so much,
 what do I tell you? What if we get late because 
of the photocopy? We won't get late. You find out about something trivial,
 and you get worried. Now tell me, do you want 
the notes or not? I want them. Yes, then stand quietly. Brother, make a copy of 
this entire thing. Okay, madam, but the machine
is not working, it will take some time. 
It will take time. So, no issue, 
it will get done. You make it. Make it. 
Hi. Hi. You are here, in the university? Actually, I came to meet a friend,
I saw you, so I came here. You tell me, what is going on? I am absolutely fine. 
This is my best friend, Dua. Greetings. Greetings. Who is he? I had told you, the one I recently started 
an affair with. Fahad. God knows how many affairs 
you have and then they end. How many do I remember? This is my friend, Faraz. Hello. 
Hello Faraz. Hey, man, you should have told me 
that you are coming here for a date, so… You look really handsome rough 
and tough too. Don’t worry. We will go sit somewhere 
and have a cold drink. Yes, yes, come on, 
we will go. No. No. I won't go. Yes, but why? 
Why won't you go? There is a lot of time for 
the copy to be made. Hey, so no issues, 
let’s stay here. I will stand here. You will stand here alone? Hey, when is she alone?
 Faraz is here. Till then the copy will be made, 
we will come back. Yes, good idea.
Okay, he will give you company, 
we will come. Rida. Rida. Ri… You are a really close friend. Yes. A lot. I think you too are unaware 
just like me. Maybe. Brother, how long will it take? It will take some time. So, come, we will sit and wait. Come on. No, if you want to go and sit,
then sit. I am fine here. Hey, he himself is saying 
it will take so much time, then we will go and sit somewhere. I… in fact, I will go home. 
When this is done, you give the notes to Rida.
I will take it from her tomorrow. Look, I am not as bad a man 
as you think of me. And Fahad is a really 
good friend of mine, he is like my brother. And because of Rida, 
you are respectable to me. Don’t worry. I am not worried, I just want to go home. Hey, they will find it so weird, if you will leave from here 
before they come back, they will think, 
God knows what I said. Look, I am really a very decent man. You come on, we will sit and wait for them. Come on. Thank you. Have it. Rida is mentioned often, but Fahad never told me, that Rida has such a beautiful 
friend as well. You know, I was not coming here today, Fahad insisted, but had I not come, I would have been really disappointed. Disappointed about what? That I didn’t see you, I didn’t meet you. I am getting late, I will go. 
Hey… I am so sorry. I am so sorry, 
it was an accident. I will go. 
Hey… hey, listen. What is this? See it yourself. Thank you, I will go home and see. 
Rida, come on. Hey, I am so sorry, 
it was an accident. Rida, please come on. Okay, let's get the notes. 
We will get them later. Come on. Okay. Okay, bye. 
Bye. Bye. What happened? I mean, 
you are behaving like this… Hey, what did you say to her?
She is not stopping. Hey, what could I say? Now, do you want to go, or do you want to drop her home 
with your eyes? I wish I could drop her. I think you really like her. Think that. Shall we go? Come on?
Yes, man, come on. Come on. I have told you so many times when you enter the home, 
you should offer salutations. Sorry. Greetings. It slipped my mind. How did it slip your mind? Is this something that 
should slip your mind? And where were you all day long? Mama, I was outside with my friend. You know my friend Fahad, with him. Did you even eat anything or were you going around aimlessly 
with your friend all day long? I have eaten. I am just going to my room to rest. Tell Sumbul, not to disturb me. It is time for the sunset prayers, 
is this time to rest? Mama, I am going to rest, 
you just leave me. Are you feeling okay?
I feel absolutely fine. I am so sorry, 
it was an accident. I am not as bad a man 
as you think of me. And because of Rida, 
you are respectable to me. Rida is mentioned often, but Fahad never told me, that Rida has such a 
beautiful friend as well. You know, I was not coming here today, but had I not come, I would have been really disappointed. That I didn’t see you, I didn’t meet you. Yes, go ahead. Listen, I want you to do something. What? I want the number of Rida’s friend, 
Dua. Hey, so the number, 
right now…. I don’t know. 
Where do I get it from, buddy? Now, you can only understand. Okay, give me two minutes, 
let me talk to Rida, and then I will WhatsApp you. 
Okay? Okay, I am waiting. Dua. What? Do you think a girl on the road 
is your father’s property, that it becomes your responsibility 
to tease and touch them? And you? When you leave the home, 
then be strong and courageous. Now what are you looking at? Move. Will you leave or should I hit you?
Are you leaving? Are you okay? Where is this girl? 
She took so long. Greetings mama. Greetings. 
Where were you? Mama, a boy was teasing 
a girl at the bus stop. I taught him such a lesson 
that he will not forget. Don’t get involved in 
the fights of others, and also be careful 
about the time. You know your father’s 
temperament, right? I didn’t do it on purpose. Be careful in the future. Are you going somewhere? And where are Fiza and Sania?
 I don’t see them. It is Mr. Bakhsi’s grandson’s birthday. Those two have gone there. I too was going, 
I was waiting for you. I will wait if you want to come along. No, what do I have to do going there? They will have the same stale chips and cold potato samosas. Hey, I don’t want to go. You go. Okay listen, have food after you 
change your clothes. I have covered it and 
kept it for you. And I have made your favorite 
chicken today. Okay. Okay. And lock the door, only open it when your father comes. If someone knocks just like that,
don’t open it. I won’t open it at all. 
Okay. Come on, take care of yourself. Lock the door. 
Yes. Yes. Yes. Rida, you didn’t come 
to the university today? Yes, I have a fever, that is why I might not even 
be able to go tomorrow. Okay listen, right now, I have called
you because Faraz forced me. Since he has seen your friend, 
he has lost his senses. He is asking for her number 
again and again. I have told you so many times, Dua doesn’t have a phone. Look, I have given 
your message to him, but he doesn’t believe me. You talk to him yourself, 
he is standing in front of me. Here you go. Yes, Rida, how are you? Does she not have a phone? If she had a phone, then why would I lie to you? Yes, but there must be a way
to get in touch with her. Look, I couldn’t go to the university today, and maybe I won’t be able 
to go tomorrow either. Or else I would have let you 
talk to her on my phone. Look, Rida, whatever it is, find out a way that 
I can talk to her, please. There is no way. The environment of her home 
is really strict, which is why she doesn’t 
even have permission to go to the neighbor's home 
and talk on the phone. By the way, for doing all this, it's necessary to know, like you've become obsessed 
with seeing a glimpse of Dua, is she also obsessed with you? Or is this fire one-sided? I am restless to find out all this. And listen, 
I have to talk to her today, and if I don’t talk to her 
for two to three days, I will give my life. 
For Fahad’s sake. How do I tell you there is no way? I just have her home address. If you want, I can give it to you. I went to her home once. Yes, sure, tell me. Thank you. Okay, thank you. See you. Are you satisfied now? Yes. 
Come on. Even Rida didn’t come. Had she come, I would have 
asked her about Faraz. I would have gotten some news, that is he too thinking about me 
constantly like I am thinking about him. I am coming. Faraz. How are you? I came from so far only 
to meet you, to see you. That day I saw you, 
now I didn’t understand how I should come to see you. I thought I would come 
and meet you. Papa. Who are you? I was asking for an address. Did you only see this door 
in the entire neighborhood? And you, get inside. Give us the right address. 
We are coming. We are coming. Leave from here. Come on. Come on.
 Come on. Leave quickly, brother. Come on, leave brother. 
How would you know? Why are you worried?
Sit in the car, drive quickly. Who told you to tell these 
stranger boys the address? Mama had said you would come. It was time for you to come, 
I thought that you… You thought so and you 
opened the door, right? No… You didn’t think how secluded the streets 
of the neighborhood are at this hour. Anything can happen. Sorry Papa, I didn’t realize. I will be careful in the future. I will be careful in the future. What is the matter? Just think my respect 
got saved a little. What happened Dua? Why are you asking her? Ask me. When I entered the street, she was standing at the door with 
two young men,  two stranger boys, telling them the address. They were asking the address 
and she was telling them. Dua…
No, no, Papa came immediately, 
I didn’t even talk to them. Hey, thank God no one 
in the neighborhood saw it, or else the entire neighborhood 
would have spit on us, that Mr. Akram who was such a 
religious man, his granddaughter, is standing outside and telling 
stranger boys, the address. You shouldn’t have opened the door. I had strictly told you not to. Mama, I told you, 
I made a mistake. I will be careful in the future. Tell me something, where did the three of you go 
for an outing leaving her alone? It was Mr. Bakhshi’s grandson’s 
birthday, so we…. Mr. Bakhshi.
He's a real troublemaker. He follows the customs 
of the British and Jews. You should understand this. From now on, you going to such 
foreign gatherings is completely over. No one will go. Sister Nudrat had really insisted, 
and then, we are old neighbors. Hey sister Nudrat insisted 
and you went? When she invites you to hell, 
then you go ahead. I have told you people 
for the future, that no one will go 
to such gatherings. And Dua, hear one thing clearly, after today, if some boy, some stranger stands 
outside the door, I will surely murder him, and I will also break your legs.
Understand? Okay, I will make her understand. You go and rest, 
I will bring water for you. Yes, bring me water.
I am tired. Your daughters will kill me. I had told you not to, then why did you open the door? You don’t learn.
