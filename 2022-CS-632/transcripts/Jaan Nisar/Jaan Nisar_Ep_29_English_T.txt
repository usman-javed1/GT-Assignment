[26.16] Do you still not trust me?
[28.44] I trust you the most.
[33.12] Then what is the reason
for getting scared?
[35.24] Now, if I have any fear,
then that is of losing you.
[40.16] I had gotten scared,
[42.80] that you might leave me.
[45.68] This will never happen.
[47.32] Trust me.
[49.64] I have just started to trust.
[52.48] If something like this happens,
[54.44] then my existence will be erased.
[57.32] I will not let it get erased.
[58.76] This is my promise to you.
[60.88] You have no idea that Nosherwan
used to love Farah like crazy.
[66.96] And when Farah is no longer there, then,
[69.28] how can you always remain?
[87.04] Do I seem like someone
who would change to you?
[93.40] I don’t know,
[96.20] but now I have started to be afraid.
[99.84] When I am with you,
then what are you afraid of?
[125.08] Kausar.
[126.64] Kausar.
[129.00] Where are you? Kausar.
[131.88] What happened?
Why are you so angry?
[134.28] Call and tell your son to come home
immediately, wherever he is.
[138.16] What did my son do now?
[140.00] What did he do?
[141.44] He's determined to ruin
the entire family's honor.
[146.52] There.
[147.76] Sarfaraz is here. You ask him.
[150.32] Tell us, what is the matter?
[151.76] What are you asking me? Ask him.
[154.88] But, what do I have to ask him?
Tell me this.
[157.76] Why are you standing quietly?
Answer her.
[161.48] Hey, tell me.
[163.08] What is the matter?
What has happened?
[166.56] Nothing.
[168.12] I don’t know why he is talking like this.
[169.72] Nothing happened?
[171.44] If nothing happened,
then who was that girl?
[178.44] Hey, I am ashamed to say this and
you are saying nothing happened.
[183.76] Girl? Which girl?
[186.16] Ask him
[188.04] why he's out having fun with girls
instead of coming home after work.
[194.24] He has a young sister
and wife at home,
[197.52] yet he chooses to develop
relationships with other girls.
[203.40] Why don’t you tell us,
who was that girl?
[206.32] Which girl were you with?
[207.80] Hey, so what sin did I commit?
[210.52] She was my friend,
so can I not meet her?
[216.96] You were so informal with her?
[219.20] What you call familiarity was
considered so in your time.
[222.72] Nowadays, it's all normal.
[224.60] Indecency remains indecency in any era.
[228.36] And remember, I am your father,
not the other way around,
[231.44] so don't try to lecture me.
[233.72] Well, you understand
what you want to do.
[236.32] But don't question me like
I'm some criminal or thief.
[239.40] You insolent...
[243.64] What are you doing?
[245.16] Raising your hand on a grown man?
What's gotten into you?
[247.56] Discipline your grown-up child.
[250.48] Explain to him that with a wife at home,
[254.76] he shouldn't be making friends
with other girls outside.
[256.88] I didn't even want to keep a wife.
[259.68] Are you hearing this?
[260.76] Are you hearing what he just said...
Hey. Hey.
[263.16] Mama, leave it. Raise it…
raise your hand at me today.
[265.04] I will make him understand.
[266.28] I am telling you
I will make him understand.
[267.64] Let him do it.
[268.76] I too will see how much he will hit me.
[270.36] I say, leave.
Go to your room.
[273.24] I will just call Mr. Aslam
[275.44] and I will tell him to come and
take his daughter from here.
[279.08] She has no value in this home.
[281.32] Surely call him.
[284.68] You will be doing me a favor on me.
[290.04] I will do him a favor. I will…
[294.12] You….
[294.76] Ill-mannered. Disgraceful.
[296.96] Stop it. You come on.
Come, sit. Sit here.
[300.08] Hey, I don’t want to sit.
[301.52] Hey, come on.
For God’s sake.
[303.84] Don’t ruin your health.
Come on, come sit.
[307.60] Sit.
[308.52] Sumbul. Sumbul, bring water.
[311.12] Okay, Mama.
[311.96] Why are making your blood pressure high?
[330.72] Where are you going?
[332.68] To the room.
[334.64] Why?
[336.72] You should have waited
for me a little longer.
[340.16] I had gotten tired.
[342.32] Already?
[347.48] I can wait for you all my life.
[353.36] I just got a little tired right now.
[357.28] I am sorry, I got a little late.
[361.44] Being late is not the issue.
[364.24] Just never forget your way home.
[369.72] Till I believe that
[374.24] you are waiting for me at home,
[377.92] then I will not go anywhere.
[385.32] I will always return home.
[388.84] I will be waiting.
[403.84] He's doing wrong and on top of that,
he's being defiant.
[407.16] There's no shame or
modesty left in his eyes.
[409.84] Why are you getting so worked up?
[413.64] I made a mistake.
I made a very big mistake.
[416.92] That you married your useless son
and I let it happen.
[421.72] You have gotten after him.
[423.80] He was saying she was his friend.
[426.12] You can believe him, I cannot.
[430.52] I have decided,
I will just call Brother Aslam
[433.36] and tell him everything.
[435.20] After that, I will accept whatever
he decides for his daughter.
[440.36] I don’t understand,
[441.76] why do you want to reveal
your son’s character to the world?
[445.16] And especially in front of the people,
[448.00] whose daughter has no character.
[453.88] It is the thinking of women like you.
[456.52] Children like Sarfaraz are born
to women who think like this.
[461.20] Hey, before you make an allegation
about someone else’s daughter,
[464.88] think that you too have a daughter.
[467.52] Hey, what is the comparison of
my daughter with these people?
[473.12] My daughter is one in a million.
One in a million.
[476.44] And son?
[477.48] What do you think about him?
[479.60] You always get worked up
over every little thing. That’s it.
[483.04] That’s it. I have decided.
[485.80] I will call Brother Aslam right now,
I will put the entire reality in front of him.
[489.36] Uncle, please don’t call Papa. Please.
[493.36] But child, your life, your happiness,
[496.76] everything is dependent on this.
[498.92] You just don’t involve Papa.
[502.76] I will talk to Sarfaraz myself,
I will take care of him.
[506.24] Yes. Yes.
[507.92] She is right.
[511.36] This is the husband and
wife’s personal matter.
[513.88] Why are you getting involved?
[520.52] Okay, fine, child.
[524.88] I will not call your father.
[527.76] But don’t consider yourself alone.
[530.72] I am here.
[531.64] I am present in place of your father.
[539.72] Stay happy.
[549.84] Did you see it?
[551.56] That’s what daughters
who have good upbringings are like.
[556.32] And then there is your son, useless.
[559.16] Hey, tell him to learn to live like a human.
[566.04] Good girl.
[568.36] She is cunning. Cunning.
[571.80] Mama, you please drink some water.
[608.76] Hello.
[611.72] Your number is always switched off.
[614.76] When you understood my number will be off,
[617.12] why are you wasting your time?
[620.72] I found you through a stroke of luck,
[623.28] I cannot lose you again and again.
[629.44] Searching for something you lost
at the same place is stupidity.
[636.16] You leave the benefit and loss to me.
[639.56] You calling me again and again
is disturbing me.
[643.64] Okay,
[645.88] at least you admitted that
you still think about me.
[650.64] You are just wasting your time.
[654.08] Agree to stand by me once,
[656.84] everything will be fine.
[659.16] I have work to do.
[661.56] Ghaz…
[668.20] You cannot run from me like this.
[699.16] Who was that girl?
[702.16] I have answered outside.
[704.36] Did you not hear it there that
you came here to bother me?
[708.88] I want to hear the truth from you.
[711.36] So, you think I am lying?
[715.32] Maybe.
[719.08] You know, this is the issue of
the people with small minds like you.
[726.64] What is the big deal in this if a boy and
girl were sitting together and having lunch?
[734.92] Fine,
[736.80] if she was just your friend
[739.48] and if you two were just having a formal lunch,
[744.44] then why did your father have
a misunderstanding?
[747.48] Because Papa is in the habit of
making a mountain out of a molehill.
[751.88] Mountains are not just made like that.
[753.92] They are made if there is a mole.
[755.92] Aren’t you talking too much?
[761.68] Don’t take undue advantage just
because I am answering you patiently.
[766.12] What has happened that you have
to search for friends outside?
[769.56] What is so bad about me?
[770.92] What is good in you?
[775.08] Your loud voice is evidence that
[778.40] Dad's suspicion is not baseless.
[780.44] Fiza, there is no need
to argue with me. Understand?
[788.12] And if you try to investigate
like this in the future,
[790.16] then you will see the worst in me.
[841.88] You look really pretty.
[844.04] Really?
[845.68] I still haven’t gotten ready yet.
[848.96] You look beautiful in every way.
[854.32] You make me delusional.
[858.12] Then become delusional.
[861.24] You are Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s chosen one.
[877.56] Really?
[879.48] Am I really your chosen one?
[884.20] Do you have a doubt?
[887.20] If I say, I have a doubt, then?
[901.64] Then I will try to remove
your doubt with my love.
[922.12] We have to go to the wedding.
[927.76] Going to the wedding is not
that important either.
[950.76] I will change and come.
[1037.52] Excuse me.
[1051.56] It is you.
[1053.12] Who else can it be?
[1055.20] No one.
[1056.80] Are you getting bored?
[1060.76] I don’t know anyone here, that’s why.
[1065.04] If you introduce her, then
she will get to know people.
[1072.40] You? Here?
[1081.20] It is my best friend’s event,
[1083.32] I had to be here.
[1093.80] Won't you introduce us?
Huh?
[1097.04] Of course.
[1099.08] This is Dua, my wife.
[1111.80] Second wife.
[1122.56] The first one was Kashmala, right?
[1132.48] Dua,
[1133.92] this is Farah.
[1140.76] Only Farah?
[1144.44] You are really a miser in the matters of words,
even today, Ghaznavi.
[1153.48] Okay, no problem.
[1155.56] I will introduce myself in detail, myself.
[1161.16] We were very good friends.
[1164.56] In fact, even now.
[1176.16] We were university friends,
[1182.92] and then…
[1184.60] Why are you in such a hurry
to tell everything?
[1187.08] So, you tell her yourself?
[1188.80] Excuse me, sir. Sir is calling you.
[1192.24] Excuse me.
[1199.04] When Ghaznavi told me
about his marriage with you,
[1202.44] then I understood,
[1204.12] that his choice cannot be anything ordinary.
[1208.44] Thank you for the compliment.
[1211.52] You are beautiful
[1214.60] but not more than me.
[1220.48] What comparison is there
between you and me?
[1223.56] I am Ghaznavi's wife,
[1227.36] and you are just a friend.
[1233.40] He used to love me.
He used to.
[1237.80] Now he loves me.
[1241.92] You know?
[1244.64] I thought you were unaware.
[1246.84] It is all an issue of your thinking.
[1251.96] Now see,
[1254.16] you came like this after so many years,
[1257.68] to tell me about some filmy story
from the university.
[1263.04] You people are mature now.
[1265.52] Move forward,
and think of something else.
[1267.84] Stay in your limit, girl.
Uh-huh.
[1270.80] Mrs. Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[1278.28] Ghaznavi has loved you at one time,
[1281.88] if not yourself,
[1283.80] then at least care for his respect.
[1287.36] Seeing you speak in such a manner,
what do you think I will think?
[1294.04] At least think about that.
[1296.60] You will think?
[1299.12] My foot.
[1303.12] What are you people talking about?
[1304.84] Nothing.
[1306.48] Farah was telling me about her
good and bad habits.
[1317.08] Do you want to stay longer
or shall we go?
[1319.08] Huh?
[1320.84] It is up to you.
[1325.36] Let’s go.
[1326.68] Let’s go.
[1330.04] Excuse me.
[1394.88] You didn’t tell me,
[1397.48] Farah was your university friend.
[1405.68] What difference do these things make?
[1408.28] You have a lot of friends.
[1412.48] Hmm.
[1415.04] But,
[1417.40] she was a little surprised when
you introduced her as a friend.
[1426.64] Why are you giving so much importance
to these things? What is wrong with you?
[1432.28] I am not giving it importance.
[1435.32] I am just asking.
[1438.84] Do you not like it?
[1441.48] Obviously.
[1443.60] When you leave the two of us
[1445.76] and include a third person in our conversation,
then I will dislike it.
[1454.08] Okay.
[1463.00] If you disliked it, then I won't do it now.
[1469.60] That’s what good wives do.
[1472.24] Really?
[1482.16] What happened to the plan of us
going abroad that you talked about?
[1487.32] It is good that you reminded me.
Be ready tomorrow.
[1490.80] We will go for your passport.
[1500.72] Coffee? Tea?
Will you have something?
[1503.08] No, man, I prefer green tea.
[1510.00] Okay.
[1545.04] Why have you come here?
[1547.40] You were not answering my call,
[1549.12] so what else could I do?
[1550.24] Farah, I am married.
Why don’t you get it?
[1555.44] You met Dua yesterday, right?
[1558.24] It makes no difference to me,
[1560.68] and she is really ordinary.
[1564.16] But, she is special to me.
[1566.56] Really special.
[1569.56] You used to say this for me as well.
[1571.24] Yes, I used to.
[1574.68] Then you made yourself, ordinary.
[1577.28] See, Ghaznavi.
[1578.44] I have apologized to you for that.
[1581.72] I don’t want anything from you.
[1584.20] Not even an apology.
[1585.20] I know,
[1586.84] you are angry with me
because I had left.
[1589.52] Please give me some time.
[1591.12] I will make redemption for all my mistakes.
[1593.60] There are certain mistakes
that cannot be redeemed.
[1598.04] Ghaznavi.
[1599.12] You are wasting your time.
[1603.44] Leave from here.
[1615.24] Please. Please, try to understand.
[1623.68] Hello.
[1625.80] Where are you?
[1627.32] I am in the office.
[1628.60] Still?
[1629.68] We had to go for the passport, right?
[1632.84] You didn’t come.
Yes,
[1635.40] an important meeting came up.
I was busy with that.
[1638.88] I have sent the driver,
he will explain everything to you.
[1642.04] Go with him, please.
[1644.92] But, Ghaznavi, I know nothing about all this.
[1648.40] Okay, don’t worry, I will send Jaffar.
[1651.20] You reach there with the driver, okay?
[1656.16] Fine.
[1657.84] Ghaznavi.
[1664.16] What was this?
[1671.48] Ghaznavi is with Farah.
[1682.28] You were ignoring me and
talking to that Dua.
[1685.76] I was getting so jealous.
She is my wife.
[1688.52] Who am I?
[1690.24] Who am I, Ghaznavi?
[1694.64] You showed me dreams of love,
[1697.60] and sacrifice also came in my share. Why?
[1700.40] Speak up, why?
[1705.12] I don’t want to repeat the past.
[1718.52] Ghaznavi,
[1720.36] you cannot ignore me.
[1722.92] Leave from here.
[1724.68] Ghaznavi, please try to understand.
[1727.04] I said, leave me.
[1730.48] And don’t come here again.
[1736.56] Leave.
[1760.68] Madam, the car is ready.
The driver is waiting for you.
[1765.04] You go ahead, I am coming.
[1768.84] You have no idea that Nosherwan
used to love Farah like crazy.
[1787.96] You are really a miser in the matters of words,
even today, Ghaznavi.
[1793.44] Okay, no problem.
[1795.44] I will introduce myself in detail, myself.
[1801.00] We were very good friends.
[1804.56] In fact, even now.
[1827.68] Fiza.
[1829.64] Fiza.
[1835.20] Fiza.
[1837.48] Fiza.
[1843.12] Fiza.
[1845.44] Fiza.
[1846.96] Fiza.
Dua.
[1849.56] Dua.
[1851.12] Dua,
[1852.04] Dua, where did you go that day? Huh?
[1854.64] And why were you not meeting us?
[1855.92] Mama, Papa, Sania?
[1857.40] They are all fine. They are all fine.
[1859.68] This…who are all these people?
[1861.64] They are with me. For my protection.
[1864.76] All? All of them?
[1865.80] Where did you go that night?
[1867.80] Tell me. Where did you go?
What happened?
[1870.40] I will tell you everything.
[1871.68] You tell me, where are you going?
[1874.92] I am going home right now.
[1878.12] Did you not resign from the school job?
[1882.08] No.
[1885.12] What happened to you?
[1887.24] Nothing.
[1888.20] I was a little unwell. I am fine now.
I am absolutely fine.
[1891.32] No, how will you go?
I will drop you home.
[1894.12] No. No. No. We will talk.
Then we will meet later.
[1898.44] Okay, come on,
give me your number.
[1900.20] No, I don’t have a number.
I don’t have a phone, Dua.
[1903.64] You give me your number,
I will contact you, okay?
[1906.24] Write your number on this,
[1907.84] then we will talk.
[1910.00] Here, write your number.
[1912.84] Even today you take
everything with you, right?
[1915.28] Everything is the same.
[1916.92] Just you were not there.
[1920.80] I will call you myself,
I will contact you,
[1923.36] then we will meet. Okay?
[1924.64] Yes.
I will call you.
[1926.36] And, I am getting late.
[1928.44] I have to reach home without fail.
And..and…
[1933.12] Okay, take care of yourself.
[1934.76] Yes. Yes.
Okay, bye.
[1936.36] You. You. You, give me the address
of your home. I will come to meet you.
[1938.80] No, I am telling you,
I will contact you and meet you.
[1940.36] I am getting late right now,
okay? Take care.
[1942.28] Come on, Brother. Come on.
[1959.24] Let’s go.
[1985.88] Did you not resign from the school job?
[1988.00] No.
[1991.00] What happened to you?
[1993.08] Nothing. I was a little unwell.
I am fine now. I am absolutely fine.
[1997.20] No, how will you go?
I will drop you home.
[2000.00] No. No. No. We will talk.
Then we will meet later.
[2015.00] Greetings.
[2016.84] What is the update on the passport?
[2026.84] You are lost in deep thought.
What are you thinking?
[2030.28] Nothing happened.
[2045.60] This.
[2051.44] What is this?
