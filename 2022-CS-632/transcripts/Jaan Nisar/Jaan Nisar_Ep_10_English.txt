Come on, one by one, make a line. In a line, in a line. All of you, take off your shoes here, one by one. Dua, life is of no use without you. My family is forcing me to get married, I cannot wait any longer now, just meet me tomorrow, I will introduce you to Mom. I am letting you go because 
you are a noble man, it would have been difficult for me,
 had the FIR been filed. Take your daughter back. She is not my daughter. Amma Saeein has called you. Is everything well? Yes, Baba Saeein and Amma Saeein 
are going home so they are calling you. But how can I leave 
Nosherwan here and go? He will be alone here all night. Don’t worry about Saeein Jr, I will stay with him 
throughout the night. Jaffar how can you understand
 the responsibilities and duties of a wife? Jaffar is absolutely right, he is here to take care of me, you may go. But Nosherwan, how can I sleep peacefully
 leaving you here like this? Nothing has happened to me. I am fine now. You may go, Jaffar won’t leave from here. Don’t be late, Baba Saeein and Amma Saeein
 are waiting for you. Jaffar, take her away. Ok Nosherwan, I am leaving just 
because you are insisting so much, but I don’t feel like going. Take care of yourself, I will come back in the morning. Come, madam. I don’t know if they find out
 anything about Dua or not. Mom and Sania 
must be so worried, and Dad, he must be getting angry 
with both of them. Don’t let your in-laws get even 
a hint of what’s going on here. Do not even mistakenly say this. Why am I so helpless? I had to get married leaving 
everyone worried at home. Dad. Mr. Aslam, where is Dua? Dua is dead for us. But you went to get her, why didn’t you bring her along? You got a call, right? Yes, I went to see her, she is with characterless girls, she has been caught. Don’t test my patience, Mr. Aslam, tell me, for God’s sake tell me. How did she get to
 the police station? Fehmida, I am even 
embarrassed to tell you, I am even embarrassed to tell. No. Dua cannot be like that, she cannot be like that. Bring her, bring her, I will ask her myself as to why she did this. Don’t you dare take her name
 in this house again, Fehmida. She is dead for us. Don’t take her name 
in this house now, otherwise, I will bury 
everyone alive. We have no place for such 
a characterless girl in our house, there is no place. What happened? Why are you nervous? When I am with you, you never have to be nervous. Look at me. By the way, one thing 
came true for me, I was sure that my family would bring 
a modest girl for me, she wouldn’t even look at any man and that is exactly what happened. You look very beautiful and you have made 
a place in my heart in this attire. Oh yes, before I forget because 
of your beauty, I have brought something for you. It’s good, right? This is very beautiful. But not more than you. Your father is dead! After what I heard today, even if I had a daughter she would have died too. Hurry up, it will be a problem 
if someone sees us. Hey, no one will see. Don’t worry. Why are you closing the door? You do understand 
the meaning of surprise, right? Look, Mom will come, she will suddenly open the door and you will be sitting here, she will like it, right? I feel dizzy. Yes, yes, so you must rest. Lie down. Dua? Poor girl is in shock. Her lover must have left her, it will take time for her to recover. Hey? He is watching you cry, he will grant you justice. Dua? Dua? Sir, sir, are you fine? I have seen her falling 
from somewhere high. Who, sir? Dua. I am sure you had a dream, Sir. But Jaffar, what kind 
of a dream it was? And why did 
I have such a dream? Is she fine? Umm, everything is fine, I am sure she must be fine too. I need to know Dua’s wellbeing, call her, ask her how she is. Don’t worry about her, sir, I am telling you 
she is absolutely well. Do what I am telling you to do. Call her right now and ask her how she is
 and where she is. Sure. Sir, I have spoken to my guy, and he said that she is home and fine. Thank God. Enough, so much makeup 
has already been done. Look here. Very good. Look here. It will be overdone. No, no, it won’t look bad. It will look good only. Sister-in-law, you look very beautiful. Thank you. You have done such good makeup. Thank you. Your sister-in-law will obviously look beautiful 
because she is beautiful. Look, she looks so pretty. Oh, I forgot. Mom is calling you. Sister-in-law, I will go check what mom
 is saying and come back, okay? I couldn’t say this to 
you in front of Sumbul, but I don’t know why, I start losing my senses
 as soon I look at you. I don’t know why I feel like you have cast a spell on me, is that so? I feel I am lucky that your hand is in my hand. Me too. And it will always be. I have received a call from the M.P. he can come here at any time, that’s why we have to let them go. I am giving you all a last
 warning and letting you go, but if I catch you next time, I won’t let you go, did you hear me? All of you, stand in a line. Take them. Go out. Come on, make a line, make a line, stand in a line. Go, you people go as well. Hurry up, come on. Come. Hey, you are walking. That’s great, but you really need to rest for now. No doctor, I would like to go home. There is a strange restlessness here. It’s because of the medicine. Fogginess happens. For now, I won’t advise you to go, I need you for a couple of days. Just one to two days, at least. Okay, Doctor. Thank you, Sir. Thank you so much. Nosherwan, you have to stay here for 2 to 3 
days like the doctor said because I cannot bear 
grief at this age anymore. Baba Saieen, men do not get scared by 
these minor wounds, I am perfectly all right now. Stay blessed, my lion-like son. The apartment that your daughter 
got arrested from, there… Tell me something, are you acting unaware or you already know all this before? Mom? Mom? Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad. My Dua. Hey? Mr. Aslam. Wait. Mr. Aslam. Dad, open the door. Leave my hand. Leave me. Let me open the door. Let me open the door. Let me open the door. Dad? Dad, open the door. Dad, Dad, it’s me, Dua. Dad, Dad, open the door, Mom? If you take one more 
step across this door, I will bury you alive. I made a huge mistake, Dad, I made a mistake. I made a huge mistake, forgive me, Let me come inside once, I will tell you everything. For God’s sake, let her come in. Get out of here. Dad, let me come in, I will tell you, Mom, it wasn’t my fault. Enough is enough, there is no place for a characterless 
girl like you in this house. We can sit inside and talk about 
whatever needs to be said. Dad, please, Dad, listen to me. No, move, move back. I am asking you to move back. Move back. Dad, for God’s sake. Move back. I am asking you to move back. Dad, listen to me, please Dad. I am telling you to move back. Dad, listen to me, Dad. Dad? Get lost. You guys come inside. Dad Mr. Aslam, my heart will explode. For God’s sake, I beg you. I beg you, let her come in. Dad? Have mercy, Dad. Dad? Mr. Aslam, let her come in. Let her come in. For God’s sake. Fehmida, don’t talk much, if you talk about this girl, I will divorce you. Brother, tea. Sister-in-law, how many spoons of sugar? Just half a teaspoon. Shall I add a whole teaspoon? Okay. Give it to me, I'll make it myself. Thank you. Make it for Mom as well. It’s almost afternoon, but the daughter-in-law’s family 
hasn’t come with breakfast yet. Hey, there must be some problem, what’s the big deal? Get breakfast made at home, we do have everything to eat 
at home by the grace of God. Breakfast will be made anyhow, and I am not dying
 to have breakfast from the daughter-in-law’s house, but there are things called
 rituals and traditions, though the daughter-in-law’s family was telling that 
they follow traditions and rituals. There is no need to make
 a big deal of such a small issue. Go check the kitchen and arrange something
 for breakfast. My child, what will you have? Nothing special, uncle. Thanks a million times to God that we didn’t take 
a curse like dowry but now I feel we are 
not even getting breakfast. At least, they should have brought breakfast, if they couldn’t bring it themselves, they could have sent 
it through someone. Umm, Mom, I will go in the kitchen. I will make breakfast. I have to make breakfast even today, wow. Breakfast? I don’t know if they would
 even be in their senses. I don’t know what my family 
must be going through. Mom, open the door. Where will I go, Mom? Dad, open the door. Don’t leave me alone like this. I am your daughter. Mom, your Dua. I am your Dua. I am your Dua. Do feed him the soup. I have brought food
 for him from home. Try to give him this for now, keep him on liquid for now. Oh okay. You are his? I am his wife. Okay. Okay, you need to give
 him medicine after lunch. Hmm. And a tablet from this. Okay. Thank you. You are troubling yourself 
for no reason, go home, Jaffar is here with me, children must be missing you,
 they will get worried. I will eat it myself. Jaffar is not your wife, Nosherwan, I will feed you. Very good What? No, no, sister, I am sure you had 
a misunderstanding. No. What? Hmm, that is why so much drama 
was being done there. Okay, thank you, sister, I will talk to you later. Yes, yes. Bye. Mr. Nazeer? Okay, I will ask and let you know. Okay my child, let me ask and let you know. Okay, bye, bye. Kids are missing you a lot, they were asking if they could
 come to meet you here. No, it wouldn’t be right
 to call them here. I will go to meet them very soon. I wish you would love me as much as you love the kids. Do you get jealous of the kids too? I am not getting jealous, I am just being envious of their luck. Where were you, Jaffar? I was just here, outside. Where is my phone? it is with me. Give it to me, I need to make a call. okay… Mmhmm, not at all, don’t give it to him. Are you in your senses? I am in my senses, that is why I am saying that it’s good if you stay away
 from all the stresses. I know better what’s good 
and what’s bad for me. Jaffar? Yes sir? Take madam home, she needs rest. Nosherwan, I… Jaffar? Let’s go, Madam. Jaffar? Yes, Sir? Phone. Sorry, Sir. I will go home and then I will come back in two hours to pick you. Are you mad? Home is just two streets away, I will go with a kid. Now look, it’s better for me to go help
 Mom instead of sitting here. You know how Dad makes her nervous. Wow, madam, wow, you are sitting here so peacefully
 after ruining the peace of our life, how do you act so well? Why are you proving
 to be an illiterate? What happened? What was your mother saying? That my daughter had 
food poisoning, she had food poisoning or did she run away 
with someone? They kept on saying 
throughout the wedding that my daughter was not well, she wasn’t unwell, she left with someone, she ran away. Oh God, we have gotten into
 what kind of a family, our fate has been destroyed, a girl from what kind of a family 
has come into our house. Hey, what are you saying? And who told you this? What am I saying? That girl has been caught
 at the police station. Thank God that 
an acquaintance called me, she used to live near their area, this matter has spread, 
not just in the entire neighborhood, but the entire city. Dua is not like that. Dua? Yes, yes, Dua, her sister. No, do you know, my sister is not like that, she cannot do this. Do you know, I am sure something
 happened to her, someone trapped
 her in this trouble. No one even came to ask us or welcome us, yeah? And they kept on lying to us? That the daughter is unwell. Wow, wow. Tomorrow? It is the wedding day tomorrow. Faraz, I am getting very late, I have to be home before 
the groom and family. They didn’t know anything as well, what could we do? Dua? Is everything okay? I feel dizzy. What is Fiza’s fault in 
whatever happened? You are yelling 
at her for no reason. I am yelling because when people find 
out about our family, what will you tell them? This is what the sister of 
our daughter-in-law does. No, no, Dua is not like this, I am telling you, she cannot do this, I know something has
 definitely happened to her. Hey, we understand all 
your dramas very well. Sarfaraz? Hello? Hello? Faraz? Yes, what is it? Where are you? What do you mean by where I am? I am at home. No, I mean, is Dua with you? Why would Dua be with me? I am trying your 
phone since yesterday, but your phone was switched off. Yes, my phone’s
 battery died yesterday, but why are you asking about Dua? Where did Dua go 
if she is not with you? Rida, tell me clearly, what are you trying to say? Look, I went to Dua’s home for her
 sister’s wedding yesterday, I think Dua has eloped and I thought she would be with you. Do you know, her father was so angry, he was investigating me, he was asking me to tell him who is his daughter 
having an affair with.
