[29.60] Where is Khizer?
[31.32] I don’t know,
[32.48] he was saying I am just 
5 minutes away, on my way.
[37.56] See, we might be late.
[42.48] Even the messages aren’t 
getting delivered now.
[45.00] I guess there are signal issues here. 
Sister-in-law, shall I go out and talk?
[48.28] Yes, go quickly.
[67.24] Greetings.
[69.92] Greetings.
[71.96] I am sure you must be sister-in-law Fiza.
[75.68] Yes.
[78.28] The way Sumbul has introduced you,
[80.08] I can’t make any mistake in recognizing you.
[82.92] Can I sit here if you allow it?
[84.36] Yes, yes, why not? Sit.
[89.88] Sister-in-law, Sumbul?
[90.80] She just went out to call you,
 there were some signal issues here.
[95.16] Okay
[96.28] Actually, sister-in-law, I barely get 
any time while I am on duty,
[99.52] I came because you called me, sorry, 
Sumbul wanted me to meet you.
[103.68] Hey, where have you brought me?
[105.60] Prawn karahi is amazing here,
[108.08] you just try it, 
and you will praise it then.
[110.80] Let’s see what your prawn karahi is like.
[112.92] Come.
[113.84] I do have an idea why Sumbul 
wants me to meet you.
[121.48] She must have told you,
[123.60] there is a proposal being 
considered for her.
[127.72] Her wedding is being fixed,
[132.28] just consider it has already been fixed.
[139.56] Yes, she told me.
[142.12] So, won’t you take a stand?
[149.92] I am helpless,
[152.24] for God’s sake, 
don’t think I am careless,
[154.92] I need some time, 
I cannot marry right now.
[157.32] How dare you talk about marriage?
[161.76] Who are you? Yeah?
[165.84] I can also take you to the police station 
for raising your hand on a policeman.
[172.64] You must be a policeman at your home,
[175.60] how dare you have an affair with her?
[178.40] Sarfaraz? Sarfaraz, please.
[182.88] You fool me and come to meet him?
[193.00] Since when has this been going on?
[194.36] You are getting it wrong, 
there is nothing like that.
[201.76] Yes, you would say 
there is nothing like that,
[204.12] you are as characterless as your sister.
[208.36] I will look after you when I get home,
[210.08] first let me get done with your lover.
[211.76] You are having a misunderstanding.
[214.12] Yes, yes, you will say this 
now that you are caught.
[216.44] If I don’t get you out of your uniform 
by making your video viral on social media,
[219.96] I will change my name!
[225.48] Kindly don’t do this sir, 
it is becoming an issue, please.
[227.92] Listen to me, let’s sit and talk. 
Brother, brother?
[229.28] Make him understand.
[232.52] You, what are you doing here?
[234.32] Brother, let’s go home and talk.
[236.44] Sarfaraz please don’t put up a show here,
[238.88] please, let’s go.
Please take him,
[241.12] I am on duty, 
so it can be a problem for me,
[243.48] we can talk later.
[244.88] Brother, brother, 
let’s go home and talk.
[246.56] Whatever we will talk,
 we will talk here.
[248.28] Brother, let’s go home and talk, 
please, let’s go right now, brother,
[251.08] let’s go home and talk, I will tell you 
everything, please let’s go home.
[301.20] Jaffar?
[310.88] Yes, Madam?
[315.32] You will still stay quiet,
[318.36] even after knowing 
that I know everything.
[324.56] What should I say, madam?
[328.52] Are you unaware or 
are you pretending to be unaware?
[335.76] No, madam,
[337.36] why would I do that?
[341.60] He goes with you to Farah, right?
[346.68] Yes.
[354.32] So, do you think this is right?
[357.04] Don’t you stop him?
[359.80] Sir is very simple,
[365.12] he doesn’t understand anyone’s cleverness.
[371.32] And yes,
[373.44] madam Farah is not good for him.
[380.12] So why don’t you tell him this?
[385.12] I can’t.
[393.04] Sir is sir,
[395.48] I am very concerned for him,
[402.20] that is why I am requesting you.
[407.68] What request?
[412.16] You are sensible,
[416.84] you are Sir’s wife and 
the landlady of this house,
[427.80] you must show off your right to him.
[471.40] Come inside, I will teach you a lesson. 
Brother, please brother,
[474.12] brother leave sister-in-law, brother.
[475.68] Brother please, brother. 
All your reality is in front of everyone now.
[477.92] Sister-in-law?
[478.96] Control,
[480.44] control your daughter-in-law,
[482.12] who was jeopardizing 
your honor sitting with her lover.
[492.84] What?
[495.68] That is why she took you?
[505.16] Hey, you want to spoil 
my daughter as well?
[508.00] I will kill you.
[509.56] What are you doing? 
Mom, leave her.
[512.80] Hey, move back!
[524.12] Sarfaraz,
[525.96] tell me what is the matter?
[528.72] I will tell you in detail 
but before that let me…
[531.56] Hey move back!
[533.28] What is this madness?
[535.40] Dad, I have only fulfilled 
this relationship because of you,
[538.92] only because of you
[548.12] but if I see her wandering outside 
with boys, I will…
[552.80] Hey, I asked you to move back and talk!
[556.08] When Sarfaraz is saying
[558.60] he has caught Fiza red-handed,
[565.36] you are still not believing your son.
[567.80] You are defending her? 
Her? yeah?
[569.88] Quiet!
[578.40] Tell me, Fiza,
[581.16] what Sarfaraz is saying, 
is that true?
[590.76] Here, Dad,
[592.76] her silence is telling everything.
[596.08] This is her answer.
[605.68] Fiza,
[607.72] I have asked you a question, answer me.
[610.96] Hey, how will she answer?
[614.48] Has a robber ever admitted 
that they have robbed?
[624.08] She will admit everything when 
she gets slapped by Sarfaraz twice or thrice.
[628.84] Enough, Dad, enough,
[631.56] I will not tolerate her for a moment more.
[640.52] She is as disgusting as her sister.
[652.52] Today I will…
Brother!
[655.24] Sister-in-law did go to meet Khizer, 
yes, she did.
[662.96] See,
[664.40] see,
[665.56] the truth is out are you satisfied now?
[669.36] Is your wish fulfilled now?
[671.60] But not for herself but for me.
[678.16] Sumbul?
[679.16] No, Sister-in-law, let me say it.
[681.00] Sumbul?
No, sister-in-law,
[682.88] no, sister-in-law is not as bad as 
the allegation you are putting against her.
[696.56] Brother has crossed all the limits,
 he has crossed the limits today.
[703.60] So then where did both of you 
go using the market as an excuse?
[710.80] Sister-in-law went to meet Khizer
 because I asked her to.
[723.08] Who is this Khizer?
[725.00] Khizer is an inspector 
in the police department,
[731.56] I and Khizer like each other.
[746.04] I,
[746.96] I, I wanted you all to meet Khizer but
[751.12] before that, I wanted sister in law to meet him
[760.60] because
[762.08] Khizer cannot marry right now,
[764.92] he has a lot of responsibilities of his sisters.
[772.32] You guys put me under a lot of pressure 
by bringing Fahad’s proposal in between,
[777.52] I was helpless so I told 
everything to sister-in-law
[780.20] and then I forced sister-in-law 
myself and took her
[783.76] so sister-in-law could force Khizer and 
Khizer comes with the proposal soon,
[790.28] that is why we went there 
and brother saw us,
[794.48] the rest, whatever happened 
is in front of you all.
[797.24] Sumbul,
[798.68] what rubbish are you talking? 
Have you gone mad?
[802.16] No, no, my daughter is not like this,
[805.16] she is,
[805.88] she is being provoked 
by her and saying all this.
[810.44] My daughter is not like this,
 it’s her, it’s her.
[812.48] Have some fear of God, Mom.
[814.68] Don’t put more accusations 
against sister-in-law.
[818.20] The poor woman is quiet because of me,
[821.12] she is quiet because of my honor, 
she is not saying anything.
[830.04] I can’t let her suffer more loss,
[832.48] I cannot,
[834.64] the truth is what I told you.
[847.80] My child, if you liked someone,
[851.44] why didn’t you come and talk to me?
[857.08] You have stained your honor by doing this
[862.20] and you also compromised 
your sister-in-law’s honor.
[879.36] I have made a mistake, Dad.
[882.24] No, my child,
[884.40] you haven’t made a mistake, 
it’s my fault
[900.28] that I didn't raise both of you well.
[906.00] And you,
[908.68] why are you standing quietly now?
[912.16] You were bragging about 
your manliness a lot at that time,
[915.52] for your wife you had to break her legs,
[919.24] you wanted to slap her, 
and pull her hair, yeah?
[923.92] Now, when your sister has 
accepted everything,
[927.36] so break her legs,
[934.00] break her legs! Pull her hair!
[937.08] Slap her!
[938.96] Show your manliness!
[952.72] You disgusting man!
[956.12] Let’s go, sister-in-law.
[960.20] Your son acts like such a warrior,
[964.08] control him!
[991.36] Enough, Kashmala,
[993.84] come sit with me,
[995.88] I don’t like my daughter-in-law 
massaging my legs like this.
[1000.24] Amma Saeein, I like it.
[1004.20] Stay blessed.
[1008.16] Amma Saeein, you, 
what do you think,
[1013.52] Sir will fix himself and 
not meet Farah anymore?
[1018.68] That is what I expect of Nosherwan
[1023.88] but Farah is a very clever girl
[1032.16] that is why I have asked Dua to 
beware and keep an eye on her husband.
[1042.76] And do you think
[1045.48] Dua can save Sir from Farah?
[1049.52] Yes,
[1051.72] that is what I think so.
[1060.12] She didn’t even know until I mentioned it.
[1069.64] She got really shocked after hearing it but
[1073.00] she is courageous
[1074.88] so she controlled herself.
[1085.96] Nosherwan has chosen a very sensible girl.
[1099.32] Amma Saeein, you really,
[1102.40] you have started to really like 
your younger daughter-in-law.
[1114.04] Kashmala,
[1117.28] no matter how much I like her
[1120.36] but she can never take your place.
[1128.88] You will always be our first and 
the elder daughter-in-law of this mansion.
[1141.08] You are just saying it 
to make me feel better, right?
[1149.88] Why are you insecure all the time? Yeah?
[1157.60] I,
[1159.60] I don’t like it when you praise Dua.
[1165.20] Okay,
[1166.92] I won’t,
[1170.12] just don’t cry,
[1173.24] I feel hurt.
[1179.96] Did the pain in your legs get better?
[1182.80] Obviously,
[1184.52] the pain will get better if my daughter-in-law
will massage it with so much love.
[1188.44] But leave now, it’s enough.
[1198.28] Let your uncle go,
[1199.92] someone is waiting for him over there.
[1201.88] Who is waiting for you, uncle?
[1204.32] The one who is dearer to him 
than us and everyone else.
[1211.32] Saying such things in front of 
the children doesn’t suit you.
[1214.24] And what you have done 
by bringing her between us?
[1219.32] We never had anything between us
[1221.76] that her being between us 
is hurting you so much.
[1273.00] Sorry, sister-in-law,
[1275.60] you had to bear so much 
because of me.
[1282.00] Why did you say the truth 
in front of everyone?
[1287.64] What else would I do?
[1290.84] Should I let you be the target 
of brother’s oppression?
[1295.84] When you kept my honor then
[1298.60] how can I break your trust?
[1302.00] But I couldn’t be of any use to you,
[1305.12] everything went wrong 
and revealed the truth.
[1309.44] It’s good that all that was revealed 
which I always wanted to say but I couldn’t.
[1316.48] But this is not what we wanted,
[1319.24] Sumbul, everything went wrong.
[1322.84] What happened with you was so wrong,
[1325.96] you are so hurt,
[1328.32] you should have pulled my hair
[1334.12] and you are still thinking about me?
[1338.76] Where are such sisters-in-law
[1340.92] who take so much care of their 
sisters-in-law and think so much for them?
[1344.60] You are very precious, sister-in-law.
[1346.64] Are you mad? Hmm?
[1349.68] You are dear to me like my sisters.
[1354.00] Your respect has increased 
even more for me.
[1371.56] Dad is still upset with you?
[1393.44] You have brought your daughter 
in the court rail again?
[1396.72] I am telling you our Sumbul is innocent.
[1401.76] This girl has filled her mind 
with all this stupidity,
[1421.36] otherwise, my daughter?
[1423.00] My daughter wasn’t like this, 
has she ever done this?
[1430.40] Ever since this evil girl
 came into this house,
[1434.24] the environment of our house has changed.
[1443.60] Please don’t say anything to sister-in-law.
[1446.48] We shouldn’t say anything to her? Yeah?
[1448.20] And you,
[1451.28] since when have you become so bold?
[1456.00] And don’t you have any shame?
[1457.52] That your brother is standing here, 
your father is here
[1461.56] and you are telling us about 
your relationship with some man?
[1469.36] Mom is right,
[1471.84] you have been influenced by someone.
[1482.72] I will see her once your problem is solved.
[1492.76] I,
[1494.36] I,
[1496.80] I have been in contact with 
Khizer for past two years.
[1502.08] That’s it,
[1504.60] no one will say anything now.
[1521.36] If you have known him for two years,
[1524.80] why didn’t you introduce him to us?
[1527.52] I was waiting for the right time
[1530.16] and
[1532.40] Khizer refused to meet you guys
[1535.56] because of his sisters’ responsibilities.
[1542.80] So then, it’s fine, this ends here.
[1545.24] If he has refused to meet us then 
why should we meet him?
[1556.52] Okay,
[1557.56] I admit he has his sisters’ responsibilities
on his shoulders
[1562.00] but at least he can meet us.
[1568.92] Maybe.
[1571.16] Ask Khizer to meet me.
[1574.52] What’s the need to meet him?
[1579.00] Look, he didn’t look right to me.
[1588.56] And when Fahad is here and 
we are talking to him about marriage
[1592.04] so where did he come from?
[1600.84] And what does she know 
about good or bad anyway?
[1603.84] Talk about Fahad.
[1605.40] Look,
[1606.76] it doesn’t make any difference 
whether you like him or not,
[1619.92] he is Sumbul’s choice
[1622.08] and Sumbul has to live her life with him.
[1632.76] But what will you say to brother Hassam?
[1638.04] You are friends with him,
[1640.00] it will ruin your friendship
[1648.92] and this Sumbul,
[1650.56] she is naïve,
[1651.96] she doesn’t know about her 
good and bad,
[1658.76] if she marries Fahad,
she will settle in America,
[1662.16] she will stay happy there, happy.
[1664.08] You don’t worry about brother Hassam,
[1666.80] I will talk to him myself.
[1676.36] And it was different earlier,
[1679.80] I didn’t know that 
my daughter likes someone
[1691.12] but now that I know,
[1694.84] my daughter will marry 
where she wants,
[1699.28] do you understand?
[1718.68] Forgive me, Dad.
[1722.60] My child,
[1729.84] daughters don’t look good 
when they cry.
[1744.76] Stay happy, my child,
[1750.40] stay happy.
[1759.40] Do you see him?
[1760.80] Hey, I have been seeing him 
since God knows when.
[1816.68] Where is Dua?
[1818.00] Sir, Madam has refused to eat.
[1822.52] Why? When did she have lunch?
[1824.36] Sir, she didn’t even have lunch
[1826.92] and I guess she didn’t even have breakfast.
[1832.72] Dua hasn’t eaten since morning 
and you are telling me now?
[1857.12] You said it in front of Baba Saaein 
and Amma Saeein
[1859.88] that you have no place for her 
in your heart so then why,
[1863.00] why do you go running to her 
when she calls you once?
[1865.92] On humanitarian grounds.
[1867.68] She could have died.
[1868.76] But she didn’t die. 
Okay, enough!
[1875.52] You won’t keep any terms with her, 
you won’t go there.
[1878.04] I will be in terms with her,
[1879.68] till you have some connection with her,
I will stay in terms with her.
[1884.52] And, and why shouldn’t I talk to her?
[1887.12] She can destroy my home
[1888.88] and I will just watch in the corner 
as a silent spectator?
[1891.76] Your home is not that weak, Dua,
[1894.04] that it can break if anyone tries a little.
[1903.12] Why aren’t you eating?
[1904.48] I am not hungry.
[1908.56] May I ask the reason 
why you are not hungry?
[1913.44] Farah.
[1919.04] You are escalating the fight 
between us by saying all this.
[1924.56] I am escalating it?
[1926.96] Or you don’t want to come out of her trap?
[1929.24] Dua? 
Dua, what?
[1934.16] If that’s not how it is,
[1936.12] why does she contact you?
[1942.08] Why does she take pills to commit suicide?
[1945.12] If you have refused her so many times
 that you don’t love her,
[1949.24] why isn’t she losing hope?
[1951.12] You should have asked her 
when you went to her place.
[1955.08] Both of you are really disliking that 
I went there once and asked her something.
[1962.20] Do you want to end this here or not?
[1966.44] It will end when you stop going to her 
and she stops contacting you.
[1975.40] Come, eat.
[1982.32] I will eat when I am hungry,
[1985.08] you go
[1986.60] and spend the night attending to Farah
[1989.88] because she already got saved by 
cutting her wrist, taking sleeping pills,
[1994.88] and attempting so many things 
to commit suicide,
[1998.24] I am afraid she might 
shoot herself this time
[2001.20] and her dream of committing 
suicide gets fulfilled.
[2006.36] So, you just keep on sitting with her, hmm?
[2011.40] Because nothing is more important 
for you than her life.
