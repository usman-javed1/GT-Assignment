[44.72] Hey, Madam, go easy with the oil.
[47.96] We don’t have a well of oil in our house,
[49.96] so as soon as the oil finishes,
we’ll go and fill it from there.
[55.20] You have to spend the entire month 
with this oil only.
[58.00] Mom, tell her to cook the meat properly,
[61.20] otherwise, we’ll have to wrestle 
with the pieces while eating.
[64.68] Her mom didn’t teach her anything
 while sending her to her in-laws,
[66.88] she just taught her how to have 
an affair with our brother.
[69.00] She tricked our brother 
and got married to him.
[75.20] Girls these days are only interested
in chatting on Facebook and WhatsApp,
[79.52] trapping boys in their web,
[81.32] and then getting them to marry.
[83.40] They have nothing to do 
with household chores at all.
[88.56] Pay attention to the curry,
[90.44] don't listen to what we're saying, 
it will burn.
[97.20] Here we go, a new drama has started.
[100.84] Now she'll play the victim 
and show her husband
[103.12] that because of his family, 
her hand got burned.
[109.60] Hey, whether she burns 
her hand or cuts it,
[111.36] we just want food, I'm hungry.
[116.80] It feels like eating food has 
become a distant dream.
[120.08] Hey, nothing ever happens on time anymore.
[122.20] Your daughter-in-law is so lazy.
[125.32] Mom, along with being lazy, 
she's quite the drama queen.
[128.04] It's these very dramas that 
she used to trap my brother.
[133.44] What wrong have I done to you people?
[136.28] You never miss a chance to taunt me.
[138.92] Alright, stop it now.
[140.36] There's no need to act like a victim.
Stop the drama,
[144.40] never miss a chance to taunt me.
[155.12] Here we go, now deal with her tantrums!
[157.64] She is such a drama queen!
[165.12] Nosherwan,
[169.40] if you've now decided to divorce Dua,
[176.12] then stay firm in that decision.
[181.64] Don’t make yourself weak like this.
[188.84] Mistakes are made by humans,
[191.56] but if you wear the mistake like
a necklace around your neck,
[194.92] you'll spend your whole life 
burning in the fire of regret.
[211.40] What are you upset about?
[214.40] You have Kashmala,
[216.88] the kids,
[218.36] and your whole family is with you.
[230.24] Accept it,
[232.84] accept that the girl wasn’t right for you.
[236.80] You made a mistake in choosing her.
[245.32] But now,
[246.88] if you’re getting a chance 
to correct that mistake,
[250.84] don’t waste your life like this.
[262.36] Come on, get up,
[264.20] go eat.
[265.96] Kashmala has already served the food.
[273.08] No, Mom, I am not hungry.
[275.04] I won’t eat.
[286.68] I think you need a change of environment.
[292.20] We're all going back to the mansion,
[294.28] and you should wrap up your work
and come with us.
[297.92] A change of environment 
will bring your heart at ease.
[301.76] No, Mom, I won’t go to the mansion.
[309.84] I don't feel at home there.
[317.04] What have you gained by staying here?
[325.36] She’s left spears pierced 
through your heart.
[334.52] What will people say,
[338.24] that Nosherwan's wife,
[341.32] our daughter-in-law,
[343.60] turned out to be of such low character?
[384.32] Dear,
[385.76] small issues happen in every house,
there are ups and downs.
[391.48] You should have approached it with patience.
[401.60] You left the house over 
such a small matter,
[406.72] especially at a time when 
Khizar wasn’t even home.
[412.88] It wasn’t a small matter, Dad.
[418.32] Those people made my life miserable.
[421.12] Now, if neither of them is getting 
proposals or getting married
[423.92] and are both sitting at home, 
then how is that my fault?
[428.80] I haven’t put any obstacles 
in their proposals.
[431.08] Dear, tell me, didn’t Khizar lay 
everything out before marriage?
[440.88] Didn’t he tell us everything?
[444.36] In fact, he said he didn’t want
to get married right now
[449.20] because his two elder sisters are at home.
[457.88] And he was well aware of the temperaments
of those sisters and his mother.
[463.76] Considering this, 
he made a wise decision,
[467.56] but you were in a hurry.
[473.00] You first pressured him to get married
[476.40] and then forced him to bid you off.
[484.04] So whose mistake was it?
[485.96] It was your mistake, right?
[494.88] So, when you have made this mistake,
[497.32] then you should start practicing
patience and tolerance.
[500.40] So, if their daughters don’t get married,
[504.00] would my daughter wait her entire life?
[507.44] You got her married, right?
[508.92] You have sent your daughter off 
to her in-laws, right?
[512.20] Now, the daughter also needs 
to prove her wisdom,
[516.88] and if she wants to maintain her relationship,
[519.48] then she should act with patience.
[523.44] No!
[524.68] They also need to be more open-hearted,
[527.92] how long would she keep 
listening to their taunts?
[534.40] I was telling you people from the beginning
not to make a relationship there,
[537.80] but who listens to me here?
[540.16] I didn't find him suitable from the start.
[542.32] Khizar is a very good and composed boy.
[550.40] Your sister will have to handle 
things wisely and with patience
[555.04] if she wants to maintain her 
relationship there.
[560.04] So, what else should we do?
[561.52] She does so much for them, 
yet they aren’t happy with anything.
[571.08] Should she just die?
[572.32] Sacrifice her life just to please them?
[576.24] Listen to me,
[579.00] have you forgotten all of Fiza's services?
[589.08] Hey, she used to wake up every morning
and make breakfast for everyone first.
[592.96] After that, she would go to school,
[594.76] and after coming back from school,
[596.64] she would cook food for everyone.
[605.20] You, mother and daughter, 
would rest all day,
[608.56] while she worked like 
a servant without a break.
[618.72] Yet, you were never satisfied 
with her services.
[622.24] Now, how did Fiza's name 
come into this issue?
[625.64] Yes, how can he not remember her?
[629.60] He has seen my face,
[631.20] because the moment he sees my face,
[632.88] he thinks of Fiza.
[641.32] This is too much!
[643.16] Instead of resolving your daughter's issue,
[644.96] you remember that girl who is 
no longer even our daughter-in-law.
[650.76] Parents all over the world 
support their children,
[654.20] while you are the only one 
who keeps criticizing your own children
[657.92] and constantly lectures them.
[659.44] Hey, mothers like you are the ones 
who ruin their daughters' homes.
[672.88] Keep quiet,
[674.48] I'll talk to him.
[676.36] Don't worry.
[695.88] Yes, Madam, did you call for me?
[698.76] Are the papers ready?
[700.08] No, not yet.
[704.56] Why not?
[705.96] Umm,
[707.04] because the lawyer has gone out of town.
[712.00] So, what if the lawyer is out of town?
[714.16] Isn't there any other lawyer in the city?
[718.84] No, Madam,
[721.72] Sir specifically asked for that lawyer.
[726.84] Okay,
[728.28] but he must have an assistant, Jaffar.
[730.52] Get him on the phone to talk to Saeein,
[732.36] the papers can be prepared like that, right?
[736.40] Yes, Madam, how can I advise Sir?
[742.64] He does whatever he pleases, 
I'm just a servant of his orders.
[748.48] He specifically asked for that lawyer,
[750.68] but that lawyer has gone out of town.
[756.88] Is the lawyer really out of town,
[760.32] or are you deliberately
delaying things, Jaffar?
[764.20] No Madam,
[766.84] why would I delay things?
[770.68] It’s okay,
[772.24] don't tell me.
[774.24] I will find out for myself
[780.52] whether the lawyer is really 
out of town or if something is fishy.
[785.00] And Jaffar, if I discover 
that this is all your doing,
[789.08] just remember what I'll do to you.
[811.48] Dear Khizar, you did well 
to come to pick up Sumbul,
[816.88] otherwise,
[818.12] I was coming myself to drop her off to you.
[823.08] Sumbul didn’t do right 
by coming here,
[831.44] whatever argument 
she had with Mom and sisters,
[834.20] at least she should’ve waited 
for me to come home.
[843.12] You’re right son
[845.64] and we were also trying 
to explain this to Sumbul.
[855.32] She shouldn’t have left the house like this,
[861.72] especially in your absence
[864.52] and without asking for your permission.
[876.00] She made a big mistake.
[879.12] But you are sensible and
[883.08] by coming here, 
you have shown a lot of wisdom.
[891.48] Your mom and sisters do not 
like my daughter at all,
[897.36] they can’t stand her.
[903.96] They keep taunting her 
from morning till evening.
[910.08] If my daughter shouldn’t have come here, 
then tell me, where else would she go?
[913.60] Why don’t you rein in your mother 
and sister’s tongues?
[921.00] Aunty,
[922.48] I try very hard to avoid any arguments
between Sumbul and Mom or sisters,
[928.64] but you also need to understand
[930.92] that Sumbul should take care 
of her responsibilities.
[934.84] If she completes her work on time,
[937.64] she won’t give anyone 
a reason to complain,
[939.44] then no one will say anything to her.
[944.60] Look, Mom is getting older,
[947.24] and if she doesn't get her food 
on time and says something,
[951.28] then what was the need to 
argue and come home?
[956.88] Why?
[958.44] Is my daughter a maid in your house?
[966.48] Or has she taken on the responsibility 
of serving your mom and sisters?
[975.88] If they enjoy eating food so much,
[979.00] then she has two daughters 
of her own as well,
[981.32] tell them to cook!
[984.08] Was food not prepared in your house
when Sumbul wasn’t there?
[988.80] Tell me one thing,
[991.36] when you took my sister from this house,
[994.72] did you take her as a wife or as a maid?
[998.16] Mr. Sarfaraz, you also please 
answer me one thing.
[1002.08] I've been visiting this house quite often,
[1005.44] so I’m not a stranger
[1008.04] and I’m addressing both of you.
[1011.08] Is Fiza the daughter-in-law 
of this house or a maid?
[1020.20] Stay within your limits, understood?
[1022.88] This is my personal matter.
[1025.24] You should also stay within your limits.
[1027.20] She is my wife, 
she came here upset with me,
[1029.44] I am her husband,
and I will make it right.
[1031.16] Please shut up your nonsense.
[1034.56] How can I stay out of this matter, huh?
[1036.92] We're talking about my sister!
[1041.64] Sister-in-law Fiza was 
also someone’s sister.
[1053.88] Do you have no empathy for 
another woman’s suffering?
[1057.40] And now that it’s your own sister, 
you’re shouting so much? Huh?
[1062.20] Sarfaraz, go inside.
[1064.80] What else do you want to talk to him about?
[1067.20] He’s saying whatever comes to his mind,
and you’re listening to him?
[1072.60] Why are you giving him 
so much importance?
[1074.04] I told you, I’m talking to him! 
You go inside!
[1077.32] Sumbul isn't going anywhere!
[1080.88] She will stay in this house!
[1083.52] That house is hell for her, hell.
[1086.32] Fine.
[1087.68] Then keep your daughter, sir, 
my apologies,
[1090.96] and you keep your sister like 
a statue in front of you. Goodbye.
[1095.92] Khizar!
[1096.56] Khizar, son!
[1128.04] Tomorrow is Zawar's death anniversary.
[1132.92] How can we leave Nosherwan alone?
[1139.40] Nosherwan isn’t ready to go to the mansion,
[1145.08] and in his current state, 
we can’t leave him and go.
[1156.00] Saeein, I was thinking of organizing 
Zawar's anniversary here this time.
[1168.76] I’ll call the mansion,
[1171.00] and they can arrange 
the Holy Quran recitation there too.
[1178.20] Yes,
[1181.36] maybe that…
[1183.24] that would be better.
[1191.60] I spoke to Nosherwan.
[1196.04] He's not ready to leave here.
[1206.04] Kashmala,
[1209.84] you make arrangements
for the final prayer recitation.
[1217.84] We’ll also need to arrange 
for the communal meal and
[1221.00] food and clothes will be distributed as well.
[1227.52] Oversee everything yourself.
[1233.48] I don't want anything to go wrong.
[1237.20] Don’t worry, Amma Saeein,
[1239.76] I’ll take care of everything.
[1243.00] Only God knows what is destined for us.
[1249.20] One son has already left this world,
[1252.40] and the other has turned his back 
on the world while still being alive.
[1269.24] I don’t know when this trial of
our children will finally end for us.
[1307.20] Why didn’t anyone tell me 
that Khizar came to pick me up?
[1310.16] Oh, I was just about to tell you,
[1312.44] but then Khizar and 
Sarfaraz started arguing.
[1317.40] You know how Sarfaraz is,
[1319.40] once he starts, does he listen to anyone?
[1322.16] When he had already come to pick me up,
why did Brother have to create a scene?
[1325.72] Now Khizar isn’t even answering my calls!
[1327.88] Whatever he said, 
he said out of love for you.
[1330.96] What kind of love is this 
that is ruining my home?
[1336.72] Mom,
[1337.96] if anything else goes wrong in my life,
[1341.00] I’ll never forgive my brother.
[1342.80] Oh please, now don’t put 
all the blame on Sarfaraz.
[1348.28] You were the one who fought 
with your mother-in-law
[1350.40] and sisters-in-law and 
came back to this house.
[1353.76] You were in such a hurry to get married,
[1355.60] but you didn’t learn anything before leaving.
[1357.08] At least you could have made them 
breakfast on time.
[1362.36] You must not have found time 
from all the sleeping, right?
[1366.04] And Fiza…
[1367.64] Fiza did all the work here
[1369.72] but never once complained 
about you not working.
[1376.68] And Khizar?
[1378.08] Khizar came and kicked your lazy behaviour.
[1383.56] There was Fiza,
[1385.12] who used to go to school in the morning
[1386.84] but still made breakfast before leaving,
[1388.76] and then she would come back 
from school and cook meals.
[1392.44] Yet, she never uttered a word.
[1394.60] And then there’s you!
[1396.24] Now Fiza has become the good one 
just because she’s not here anymore,
[1398.68] and I’ve become the bad one 
because I came home.
[1405.00] When a daughter comes back home,
[1407.36] she becomes a burden, doesn’t she?
[1410.56] Where did being a burden come from here?
[1413.12] You were so desperate to get married.
[1415.32] You rushed into it,
[1416.40] you should’ve at least learned 
something properly.
[1420.84] And now, after fighting there, 
you’ve come back here,
[1423.00] and you’ve made your father, brother,
and husband fight amongst themselves!
[1427.16] They’ll keep fighting and die!
[1431.32] Let me tell you one thing clearly,
[1434.44] don’t come back to this house 
after fighting at your own home! Got it?
[1438.08] Keep your fights in your own house!
[1444.64] You’ve spread chaos in the house.
[1477.04] Hello?
[1479.24] Yes, Jaffar, go ahead.
[1481.64] Uh, yes, Madam,
[1484.20] whatever needs to be done, 
please do it quickly.
[1485.80] We don’t have much time.
[1492.72] Sir has already instructed me 
to prepare the divorce papers for you.
[1504.16] I delayed him, Madam, 
by telling him that
[1508.36] the lawyer is out of town,
[1514.16] but I won’t be able to hold him off
for much longer, Madam.
[1524.60] You did the right thing,
[1526.76] but why didn’t you tell me this earlier?
[1530.44] Yes, Madam, I didn’t get the chance,
[1533.36] or I would have told you earlier.
[1539.12] Okay, fine, I’ll handle it.
[1541.88] One more thing, Madam,
[1544.28] Madam Kashmala has 
become suspicious of me.
[1547.52] We’ll need to make a move 
before she does something.
[1553.60] Don’t worry,
[1556.36] I’ll take care of it as soon as possible.
[1558.68] Yes, Madam, goodbye.
[1608.00] Why is his phone off?
[1612.80] Listen,
[1614.36] it’s 2 o’clock in the night,
[1616.80] and Sarfaraz still hasn’t come home.
[1618.60] His phone is off too.
[1620.32] He doesn’t usually do this. 
I don’t know where he has gone.
[1624.72] He must be hanging out 
with his friends somewhere.
[1627.60] He’ll come back. 
Why are you so worried?
[1630.56] You don’t sleep yourself, 
and don’t let me sleep either.
[1635.08] But his phone is off, 
and that’s never happened before.
[1638.56] His phone’s battery must have died.
[1641.28] Okay, do one thing,
[1643.60] call his friends.
[1645.52] Is this the time to be calling anyone?
[1648.24] Besides, I don’t have the numbers
of his friends.
[1653.68] I only have Fahad’s number.
[1655.92] I’ll call him if you say so.
[1657.72] Yes, yes, call Fahad.
[1660.16] Ask him if he’s with him and if not,
[1662.24] get the numbers of his other friends 
and find out where he is.
[1669.48] I’ll ask him to message me the numbers
of his other friends if he has them.
[1675.96] Is the phone off?
[1685.92] Yes.
[1687.36] Greetings, Fahad, son.
[1689.56] Sorry to bother you this late,
[1693.84] but I had to ask,
[1695.20] has Sarfaraz come to your place?
[1699.92] Son, it’s 2 a.m., 
and he hasn’t come home yet.
[1704.72] His mother is worried.
[1708.20] Do me a favor and text me 
the numbers of his other friends, will you?
[1715.24] Okay, son, thank you.
[1717.72] Thank you.
[1801.56] It’s been five years
[1804.80] since Zawar left us,
[1812.00] but it doesn’t feel like he’s not here with us.
[1821.96] My heart is heavy too, Saeein,
[1830.04] but we have to live the life 
that God has written for us.
[1841.52] You don’t worry too much,
[1844.52] I’ll take care of the Holy Quran recitation
arrangements downstairs.
[1848.40] You just rest.
[1851.44] Alright.
[1876.64] Elder Sir,
[1877.76] Mr. Jaffar has come twice since 
this morning to give you this diary,
[1880.96] but you were resting.
[1883.00] He left the diary with me,
[1884.72] asking me to give it to you 
once you wake up.
