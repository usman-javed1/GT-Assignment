[26.03] In front of my eyes, 
she gave Saeein poison,
[30.47] and I couldn't do anything.
[40.93] How would I have known that Dua,
[43.83] that Dua would mix poison 
in Saeein’s food?
[53.07] Amma Saeein, the doctors...
[56.73] Doctors are saying that 
Saeein’s survival...
[69.30] Saeein Jee,
[71.63] if something happens to our Nosherwan, 
I won't be able to bear it.
[75.67] Amma Saeein, you don't cry.
[82.43] Pray to God, let's pray that
[85.17] our Saeein gets well soon.
[121.60] Jaffar,
[123.90] throw this girl out!
[134.93] Even her shadow should not 
fall on Nosherwan.
[146.00] Why don't you leave from here?
[151.97] I told you, didn't I?
[153.83] That you shouldn't stay here.
[155.50] Please leave.
[167.27] Let her stay, Jaffar.
[170.33] She must have come to see
[172.47] whether, after her act, 
her plan was successful or not.
[177.23] Baba Saeein,
[178.83] you don't trust me either?
[187.60] I didn't do anything like that.
[194.87] My son tried to turn dirt into a crown.
[210.10] That's the exact reason I used 
to stop him from doing that,
[212.43] because people of low birth and
low status are never loyal to you.
[226.83] You've proven
[229.53] that my thoughts about you were correct.
[247.90] Nosherwan’s foolishness!
[252.30] He has prepared the tools for his own death.
[264.33] Please, believe me,
[269.03] I haven’t given poison to Ghaznavi.
[277.77] I can't do such a thing.
[282.43] There must have been a misunderstanding.
[293.87] We have misunderstood?
[300.27] Your daughter poisoned Saeein.
[309.07] And if the medical report proves it,
[311.30] no one will be able to stop her 
from going to jail.
[319.57] Alright,
[320.97] this is not the time for these conversations.
[323.83] We all should pray together 
for the child to recover.
[338.27] Child,
[340.47] but if you made the food, then 
where did the poison come from?
[347.27] I don’t know.
[355.47] I don't know how the poison 
got into the food.
[360.77] I love him so much, 
how could I take his life?
[372.93] Have courage, my child, 
have courage.
[380.10] Father,
[381.37] Father, Ghaznavi will recover, right?
[389.70] Nothing will happen to him, right?
[391.77] if anything happens to him, 
how will I stay alive?
[394.10] Where will I go?
[397.33] Yes, yes, he'll be fine.
[399.87] Don't worry.
[401.73] Child, what's the use of crying 
and wailing like this?
[404.97] Pray for his health.
[430.17] Doctor, how is my son?
[432.97] We tried our best to remove the poison,
[439.90] but it has spread throughout the body.
[450.30] We're trying our best,
[452.43] but the next few hours are 
very critical for the patient.
[470.53] Please pray for him.
[474.43] Thank you.
[492.43] You've made yourself miserable 
from all the crying.
[514.67] I knew it.
[515.63] I knew they'd start talking nonsense.
[518.33] There's no need to listen to their rubbish.
[530.37] Dua, come with me,
[531.93] you come with me.
[541.13] Hey!
[542.23] What nonsense are you saying?
[543.87] If you don’t stay quiet, 
I’ll break your face!
[548.47] Girl,
[549.90] come on, get out!
[558.53] I don't want to see you.
[560.70] Go!
[574.47] Didn’t you hear what Saeein said?
[580.57] Take her away.
[582.73] Go!
[600.07] -Let’s go child.
-No Mother, I won’t leave Ghaznavi.
[602.17] -Child let’s go,
-No, Mother.
[603.83] we’ll come again, 
Child let’s go, come on.
[605.47] No, Mother.
[653.37] We tried our best to clear the poison,
[656.27] but it has spread throughout the body.
[659.10] However, the next few hours 
are extremely critical for the patient.
[674.77] Oh God,
[676.77] please protect Ghaznavi's life.
[680.53] Don’t let anything happen to him.
[684.53] I am a great sinner,
[686.47] a very disobedient servant,
[688.77] but please, don’t reject me like others.
[694.77] Listen to my plea.
[696.20] Give Ghaznavi his life back.
[718.77] She is sitting here?
[720.57] Why are you sitting here?
[722.47] After doing all of this, 
you still aren't satisfied,
[724.50] so you came and sat here in peace?
[729.17] Get up!
[730.17] You won’t stay here.
[731.30] I’m not going anywhere.
[733.33] This is my house.
[734.67] Your house?
[736.23] What kind of house is this,
[737.87] where a murderer like you roams free?
[739.63] You poisoned Nosherwan. 
You can’t stay here.
[741.93] I’m not going anywhere.
[742.90] You have to go! Come on!
[744.37] -Leave me! What have I done?
-Come on, leave here.
[767.33] We have cleared the poison,
[774.30] but the patient is still unconscious.
[783.47] If you want, you can see the patient,
[786.97] but if the patient doesn’t regain 
consciousness by tomorrow morning,
[792.87] we won’t be able to do anything.
[800.53] Please continue your prayers.
[804.27] -Thank you, Doctor.
-Best of luck.
[838.47] Amma Saeein, Baba Saeein,
[840.63] it’s very late.
[843.10] You should go home, rest,
[845.60] and come back in the morning.
[854.67] We will stay with our son.
[867.70] I’m here with Saeein.
[869.93] Why are you all so worried?
[874.53] Jaffar is also here.
[881.03] Yes,
[883.60] Madam is right. 
You should go home and rest.
[894.07] I’m here,
[897.17] and as soon as Sir regains consciousness,
[899.87] I’ll bring you all.
[905.70] We won’t leave our son in this condition.
[920.30] Amma Saeein,
[922.67] Baba Saeein’s health isn’t great either.
[925.67] He’ll get sick.
[935.30] Please, you both go home and rest.
[941.37] I’ll take care of him,
[943.80] don’t worry.
[945.77] Okay, I’ll arrange another room here,
[950.63] so you all can rest.
[1011.87] Yes,
[1015.00] please come with me,
[1017.57] the room has been arranged.
[1027.80] Let’s go.
[1045.57] Stay close to him.
[1051.20] If you need anything, just call me.
[1055.50] Alright. Come on.
[1121.70] Nosherwan,
[1123.57] my dear Saeein...
[1127.23] sign this please.
[1130.27] Good job!
[1136.30] Here.
[1149.33] Nosherwan,
[1150.80] sign here, please.
[1155.33] Please, do it, sign.
[1159.27] Good job!
[1160.80] Keep going, good job!
[1165.53] Nosherwan.
[1195.67] Since you aren’t signing,
[1197.87] we’ll just take your thumbprint.
[1201.97] Good job,
[1211.27] here.
[1221.27] That's it, one more.
[1229.53] Good Job!
[1237.10] That’s it!
[1249.60] Oh God!
[1277.07] Yes,
[1278.10] has Saeein regained consciousness?
[1280.63] No, not yet.
[1300.20] Saeein.
[1438.37] Hello Jaffar?
[1439.90] Why are you calling me repeatedly?
[1443.23] Jaffar, just tell me,
[1446.43] how is Ghaznavi’s condition?
Is he okay?
[1448.97] What does it matter to you?
[1453.50] Your attempt to kill him failed, 
and he survived.
[1459.93] What do you want to know?
[1461.93] How many breaths 
has he left in his body?
[1464.70] Don’t say that,
[1466.67] don’t say that!
[1470.07] Believe me, I didn’t poison Ghaznavi.
[1473.37] The truth will come out once 
Saeein fully regains consciousness.
[1477.50] So, that means he hasn’t 
regained consciousness yet?
[1480.27] Please tell me, 
how is his condition?
[1483.97] For now, he is fine.
[1486.63] What are the doctors saying?
[1488.07] All you need to know is that
[1491.37] your attempt to kill him was unsuccessful.
[1499.20] So, Ghaznavi has regained consciousness?
[1501.83] He is still semi-conscious.
[1506.43] Okay.
[1547.40] You’re here?
[1550.40] Won’t you invite me in?
[1560.87] You live here,
[1564.20] in this small house?
[1567.10] It’s true what they say,
[1570.50] girls who live in small houses dream big.
[1578.30] Living in this empty house,
[1579.83] you must have suppressed 
your desires quite a lot.
[1587.80] But what surprises me is 
where you managed to reach,
[1597.30] directly to Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[1600.80] Remarkable!
[1604.80] Why are you here?
[1606.20] Because you caused me pain,
[1610.27] and when someone hurts me,
[1613.53] I can’t tolerate it. I...
[1617.40] I also want to hurt them.
[1622.47] I caused you pain?
[1625.33] You caused me pain by coming here.
[1632.17] Everything was fine 
until you came here.
[1634.70] Have you gone mad?
[1637.17] Is everything ruined because of me 
or because of you?
[1648.67] When someone comes between me 
and Nosherwan,
[1652.30] I know how to get rid of them.
[1656.27] Why don't you ease your pain 
by leaving Ghaznavi's life?
[1661.23] Who leaves whose life,
[1663.43] that’s something only time will tell.
[1671.00] Wait,
[1672.53] come in.
[1679.87] She’s Dua, arrest her!
[1682.93] What are you doing? Let go!
[1685.97] -What has my daughter done?
-What have I done?
[1688.20] Your innocent daughter tried 
to poison my husband,
[1691.27] my guardian, by mixing poison in his food.
[1701.00] She tried to kill him,
[1705.97] and I’m having your innocent daughter
arrested for that.
[1710.17] -Leave my daughter.
-I didn’t do anything.
[1714.80] You didn’t do anything?
[1717.53] I saw it with my own eyes.
[1719.90] I’m an eyewitness,
[1724.83] and I’ve already recorded my statement.
[1727.57] You’re doing all of this,
[1731.37] because you want to kick me 
out of Ghaznavi’s life.
[1735.73] You can think whatever you want,
[1738.87] it doesn’t matter to me, Dua.
[1746.40] What you are doing is wrong.
[1748.03] I’m doing wrong?
[1750.30] I am doing wrong?
[1752.60] You did wrong when you came
between me and Nosherwan.
[1764.03] You poisoned his food and 
committed the crime,
[1768.17] but I’m the one doing wrong?
[1779.33] When you rot behind bars,
[1782.97] then you’ll realize
[1785.77] the mistake you made by 
coming between me and Nosherwan.
[1800.07] Why are you just standing there?
[1802.17] Arrest her! She’s a murderer.
[1804.37] Leave me.
[1806.47] -Dua!
-Mother,
[1809.00] I’ll go myself.
[1811.13] My daughter did nothing!
[1813.40] Let’s go.
[1814.17] -Leave her alone!
-Let’s go.
[1815.43] My child, Dua, leave her.
[1818.13] Leave my hand, 
I am coming with you myself.
[1819.50] Dua!
[1836.83] Do something!
[1838.87] The police have taken my daughter!
[1842.10] I don’t understand how the police 
could just take Dua like that.
[1847.30] Her co-wife filed a case against her
[1850.80] and that’s why the police took her.
[1852.47] Do something, get up!
[1859.03] I don’t understand, 
what should we do now?
[1863.20] Let’s go to the police station 
and explain that our daughter did nothing.
[1875.57] Who will listen to you?
[1879.37] Without any witnesses or evidence,
[1881.90] the police wouldn’t have arrested her.
[1892.27] Her co-wife herself filed a case,
[1895.60] so who’s going to listen to you?
[1903.17] No,
[1904.53] We should go, we will go.
[1906.63] We have to go and tell them that 
our daughter is completely innocent.
[1919.03] Aslam,
[1920.30] we should go, 
we should go for our daughter.
[1923.67] Go, bring my scarf quickly!
[1926.83] Hurry!
[1929.07] Get up.
[1937.30] Hurry, girl! Faster.
[1943.57] Let’s go.
[1944.87] Be careful.
[1965.10] Tell me, how did you poison him?
[1967.70] I’ve already told you, 
I didn’t poison him!
[1970.47] You have to tell me 
how you poisoned him.
[1977.07] Whether Ghaznavi survives 
in the hospital or not,
[1980.57] we’ll see later,
[1985.33] but right now, you need 
to tell me how you did it.
[1988.93] I already told you, 
I didn’t poison him.
[1991.53] You tried to kill him!
[1995.93] For what? Money?
[2001.50] Women like you,
[2003.23] who poison their husbands for money,
[2009.77] either run away with their lovers
[2012.00] or try to kill them with poison.
[2014.97] I’ve told you before, 
I didn’t poison him.
[2017.80] I didn’t try to kill Ghaznavi.
[2020.17] Oh you will confess.
[2022.90] Now that you’re here,
[2024.57] you’d better get used to it.
[2026.40] You’ll be staying here for a long time.
