[39.52] Hopefully, you believe now
[42.16] that I didn't know Khizar before today and
[45.48] hadn't met him previously.
[53.72] So?
[56.60] Your misunderstanding
must be cleared up by now.
[60.08] Yes, it is cleared.
[62.36] But if you think I am feeling guilty and
[66.12] I will apologize to you,
[67.24] then there is nothing like that.
[71.96] Because you are still
a criminal in my eyes.
[74.60] You went to meet another
man without my permission,
[79.52] and Sumbul’s rebellion
[81.84] is also because of you.
[95.28] And even after seeing everything,
[98.60] you think the same, then
[101.48] what can I say?
[102.88] Don’t say anything
[104.92] because what you saw today was a trailer,
[110.80] and in the future, if you try
[113.16] and have an affair with some man,
[116.88] then remember this trailer.
[122.72] And also understand,
it will be far worse than this.
[165.60] I had no idea
[167.44] your brother would turn out to
be such an ignorant person.
[172.16] He grabbed an on-duty officer by the collar.
[176.60] I was on patrol.
[177.72] I swear to God,
if I had stayed a bit longer,
[179.32] I would have lost my job.
[181.60] It was only because
you insisted so much that
[184.72] I came to meet
sister-in-law at the restaurant.
[187.88] We are all very embarrassed as well.
[190.40] I feel sorry for your sister-in-law.
[193.20] How is she living her life with this animal?
[198.84] Poor sister-in-law is actually very good.
[201.04] He humiliates my poor
sister-in-law all the time.
[203.76] Then, make him understand to act humanely.
[207.52] He doesn’t listen to anyone.
[209.52] He just does what he wants.
[213.60] If this continues,
[215.88] I swear to God,
your sister-in-law's life will become hell.
[219.64] What can we do?
[221.68] Apart from praying
we have no other solution.
[224.12] May God just guide my brother.
[227.64] Guidance has to be sought.
[230.04] It doesn't come on its own.
[232.40] And if a person doesn't even expect it,
[233.84] how can they ever receive it?
[235.20] Khizar,
[236.72] we will discuss this issue later,
[238.80] I have to talk to you about
something important related to us.
[246.76] Go ahead.
[248.32] Papa wants to meet you.
[250.72] Papa wants to meet?
[254.84] I came to the restaurant
to meet your sister-in-law,
[257.60] and your brother humiliated me so much.
[260.00] Didn't that satisfy you?
[265.24] Now, if I come to meet your father,
[267.16] and your brother will create another scene.
[268.76] After all, he is ignorant.
[269.84] My Papa’s temperament is totally
different from that of my brother’s.
[274.32] Look, you know I cannot
marry you for a few years,
[279.76] so what will I do meeting your father?
[282.32] He will say the same thing that
I should bring your family.
[286.08] When I can take your name
in front of my family,
[288.80] then can you not take
my name in front of your family?
[294.88] Do you not love me?
[297.36] Sumbul, I love you.
[299.40] I love you a lot.
[301.36] But, think man,
[303.20] my elder sisters are sitting at home.
[305.68] I will look so shameless getting married.
[307.76] We will have to talk, Khizar.
[310.12] At least, meet Papa.
[312.16] By meeting him, at least,
[313.40] he will know that her daughter’s
choice is not wrong.
[319.36] And you discuss the issues
of your family with Papa once.
[323.32] It is possible that Papa
will give you a solution.
[328.68] Okay, if you are insisting
[331.24] so much then
I will come meet your father.
[333.84] Fine.
[334.80] Then,
[335.40] I will tell sister-in-law,
and she will talk to Papa.
[338.72] Since I cannot talk directly to Papa.
[387.12] Greetings, Amma Saeein.
[388.92] Greetings.
[390.36] How is my daughter-in-law?
[392.68] Thank God. Absolutely fine.
[395.16] Were you sleeping?
[397.12] No. No. Not at all.
[398.92] I wake up for the morning prayers,
[400.44] then I don’t feel sleepy at all.
[407.84] I really liked hearing that
[411.44] my daughter-in-law regularly prays.
[415.84] I was thinking I shouldn’t call and
bother you early in the morning.
[420.20] Not at all.
[421.20] In fact, I am really happy.
[423.44] I was thinking about giving
you a call for a long time,
[425.32] but I felt that you might not like it.
[429.56] Why?
[430.72] Hey, you are Nosherwan’s wife,
[433.28] our daughter-in-law.
[435.08] You can call me whenever you want.
[438.28] Yes,
[439.24] I will do it from now on.
[440.96] I wanted to ask you something.
[444.96] Is Nosherwan still going to Farah’s home?
[458.64] I understood from your silence that
[462.32] my talking to Nosherwan has
had no significant impact.
[466.60] What can I say, Amma Saeein?
[469.68] I feel that
[471.84] maybe Farah can never leave his heart.
[488.60] Anyway, don’t worry.
[490.80] I feel that this time I will have
to make harsh decisions.
[495.80] So, don’t worry,
[497.36] I am with you.
[502.48] Thank you.
[505.24] Take care of yourself.
[506.20] Goodbye.
[508.24] Goodbye.
[514.20] Sukha.
[516.36] Yes, Amma Saeein?
[518.52] Bring tea for me,
and add ginger to it.
[520.92] Sure, Amma Saeein.
[531.24] Did you complain
to Amma Saeein about me?
[538.12] You complain to the ones
who are unaware.
[543.88] Amma Saeein is aware of everything.
[582.36] Whatever happened yesterday,
[584.44] whether someone was right or wrong,
[589.04] discussing the matter is of no use.
[592.20] However, whatever happened
should not have happened.
[599.56] Such matters should be discussed
with respect within the four walls of the home.
[615.44] They should never reach
a restaurant or hotel,
[618.52] otherwise,
[619.44] problems arise, and
[622.28] what happened, happens.
[625.24] Uncle, you are absolutely right,
[628.40] and I will not lie to you.
[629.52] I was refusing to meet you people.
[640.96] But Sumbul was really anxious
with regards to her proposal
[647.16] and she was also insisting
that I come to meet you.
[660.08] Uncle, my life has some issues,
[664.36] that is why I was refusing
to meet you people.
[675.60] Look, if you have issues in your life,
[678.16] then you shouldn’t have committed to Sumbul.
[693.20] Now, neither are you sending your family
to our home to ask for the proposal,
[698.44] and nor do you agree that
we marry Sumbul somewhere else.
[704.52] There must be a solution
to this issue, right?
[707.76] If there was a solution
I would not have stepped back, Uncle.
[718.44] So, are you stepping back, now?
[726.48] Fine, then we will marry
Sumbul somewhere else.
[740.56] I will step back, Uncle.
[743.32] But after that, neither I, nor I hope,
Sumbul will be able to stay happy.
[749.40] Speak for yourself.
[751.44] We are here for Sumbul.
[757.68] Look, if it is a matter of
the happiness of you both,
[760.80] then the better solution is that
[762.40] you send your family over to our home,
[764.68] and have this matter sorted.
[769.88] Fine, we will marry you two right now.
[772.76] We will have the reception when you
fulfill the responsibility of your sisters.
[786.60] But in this whole matter,
I can give you a year.
[791.36] No more than that.
[796.80] But, Mr. Naseer, you are being…
[805.32] Look,
[807.52] I am giving you time with an open heart.
[811.36] Think and decide,
and let us know of your decision.
[826.48] I accept.
[845.96] Alright then.
[847.64] Find a suitable time and
bring your family here.
[850.68] Let's settle all the matters.
[853.64] As for the issue of your sisters' marriage,
[858.36] look, I will help as much as I can.
[862.52] After all,
[863.84] your sisters must be
like Sumbul as well, right?
[880.00] Thank you, Uncle.
[881.20] Thank you very much.
[882.96] I will inform you really soon.
[885.40] Uncle, please give me permission to leave.
[887.36] I should get going.
[887.88] Sit for a minute.
[890.32] Fiza, child.
[892.44] Yes. Yes.
[894.20] Fiza, bring tea for Khizar.
[897.92] Sure, I will just bring it.
[929.96] Sister-in-law.
[934.24] Thank you so much.
[936.76] Why are you thanking me?
[938.16] You are my sister.
[940.56] You have done more than
my own would have done.
[943.40] Khizar and I will always
be grateful to you.
[946.24] If you talk to me like a stranger,
then I will get upset.
[949.84] If my friend gets upset,
[951.64] then I will be in trouble.
[954.20] Congratulations to you.
[956.72] Hmm.
[957.52] The good thing is that
[958.84] Papa handled the situation and
[960.68] Khizar also understood it.
[962.04] All this has been made possible
because of you.
[964.84] I am just sad about
the way Brother treated you.
[970.44] Leave this useless discussion
on this happy occasion.
[974.20] You just think that
Khizar’s family will come
[977.80] and you will get married.
[982.04] You go quickly, I will bring it.
[983.44] Okay.
[1004.48] Madam, did you call me?
[1006.68] Yes, I am going for dinner with Ghaznavi,
[1009.08] don’t prepare food for me.
[1010.52] Prepare and eat whatever you
feel like eating.
[1012.96] Sure.
[1014.80] Till when will you come back?
[1020.08] Today, I am in a really good mood,
[1022.20] or else I would have surely scolded you for
asking me such a useless question.
[1025.52] I am telling you,
I am going with Ghaznavi,
[1027.32] I don’t know
when I will come back.
[1028.60] That is why I am saying
you have your food and go to sleep.
[1030.60] Lock the door, I have the keys.
[1033.92] Sure.
[1038.00] What did you do?
[1040.80] Why did you say yes to the marriage?
[1042.68] So, what else could I do?
[1044.72] You could have done anything,
[1046.76] but you shouldn’t have taken
the discussion forward to the wedding.
[1053.76] Mama is right.
[1056.28] Neither have we met his family
[1057.96] nor do we know them,
[1060.24] and you took the discussion forward.
[1062.52] Look, our objective was to meet Khizar.
[1067.92] After meeting him,
[1069.28] I felt that he was a reasonable boy.
[1079.72] As far as his family is concerned,
[1082.16] look, it's our Sumbul
who has to live her life,
[1086.28] and since Sumbul has already decided that
[1088.80] she wants to spend her
entire life with Khizar,
[1091.76] then who are you and I to object?
[1100.40] Sumbul is a child.
[1102.32] She has no idea about
the ups and downs of life.
[1106.92] Sumbul is not that much of a child now.
[1109.96] She has surely seen something in Khizar
[1112.00] and chosen him.
[1114.28] After all, he is a good boy,
[1116.28] he is good-looking,
[1117.24] and he is a government employee.
[1119.16] Now even Fiza came here
[1122.00] and she is adjusting to
a different environment.
[1127.84] Sumbul too will have to go
[1129.60] and adjust to a different environment.
[1131.48] And Brother Hassam?
[1133.04] Fahad?
[1134.00] Fahad’s proposal is better.
[1145.52] Look, Mr. Naseer,
[1146.84] there is a big difference between
American dollars and a Pakistani salary.
[1154.52] Look,
[1155.72] our Sumbul’s heart is attached here.
[1158.44] What will she do after going to America?
[1167.92] Now end this argument here.
[1170.32] I have made my decision.
[1172.92] Sumbul will get married to Khizar.
[1186.32] And as far as Fahad and
Brother Hassam are concerned,
[1190.68] then I have already said no to Hassam.
[1193.76] What?
[1195.12] What did you say?
[1196.72] Huh?
[1197.36] You said no?
[1199.24] Did you see it?
[1200.64] Did you see what Mr. Naseer is saying?
[1204.28] I had seen a lot yesterday.
[1207.40] What is left to be seen?
[1209.08] Hey.
[1212.44] Oh God,
[1214.36] we lost such a good proposal.
[1217.80] What's happened to people's intelligence?
[1220.20] It seems like their thinking
has been clouded.
[1261.00] Where are you going?
[1263.04] Sir has asked us to prepare the cars.
[1267.12] For where?
[1269.84] I don’t know.
[1277.72] You don’t know
or you don’t want to tell me?
[1283.12] Anyway,
[1285.56] you live up to your loyalty,
[1289.28] everyone knows everything.
[1291.24] Why don’t you stop him?
[1297.04] From what?
[1299.00] When you are aware of where he goes,
[1302.68] you should stop him.
[1309.84] Even I don’t like him going there.
[1315.16] Do you think he will stop
if I tell him to?
[1356.76] You invited me for dinner,
[1358.60] I was going to die of happiness.
[1360.88] What is so special about it?
[1363.40] It is special.
[1365.24] After all, you have invited me.
[1381.04] Thank you.
[1382.96] Seriously.
[1385.08] You have ordered all the dishes I like.
[1393.96] I am so happy.
[1395.52] You remember my liking even today.
[1398.80] How can I forget?
[1403.00] Please.
[1418.96] What is this for?
[1420.36] I had asked for it.
[1423.80] It is just the two of us here, right?
[1427.04] Yes, my two special guests are coming.
[1433.00] I want you to meet them.
[1437.64] I hope you are not inviting your
Amma and Baba Saeein to meet me.
[1443.08] They are about to come.
You meet them yourselves.
[1448.24] By the way,
you should have asked me.
[1451.16] I had thought that
[1452.08] you had especially
arranged this dinner for me.
[1456.92] There is something like that.
[1461.64] Hmm.
[1468.72] Mama.
[1512.32] What is the matter?
[1514.72] Why did you get so scared?
[1527.44] Farah, this is true that I had loved you
with my heart in the past.
[1537.20] I really wanted to make you mine.
[1545.16] But when you left me and went,
[1548.92] then you were just left
in my life like a memory.
[1568.00] And even that memory ended
after Dua came into my life.
[1576.92] I found you again,
[1579.56] I tried a lot to make you understand
[1582.92] that no one can take
Dua’s place in my life now.
[1585.24] There is no room for anyone.
[1590.00] You didn’t understand.
[1598.24] You had told me that
your husband has divorced you.
[1608.08] But you didn’t tell me that
you also have a lovely son.
[1623.96] Maybe I would have forgiven you if you had lied to me as a wife?
[1632.28] But you have lied as a mother.
[1641.88] What did you think?
[1644.68] I will be so unaware of you
[1647.24] that I will believe everything you say to me.
[1661.00] I was trying to find your
lie since many days,
[1665.96] and it was not difficult for me.
[1669.80] I took out Usama’s number
from your call records.
[1674.92] Then I had no difficulty in meeting him.
[1688.60] This poor man has been begging
and pleading with you for a long time,
[1690.68] and you are constantly lying to me?
[1694.84] I have finished everything from my side
[1697.52] that is why I didn’t find it important to tell you.
[1704.28] Hmmm.
[1705.32] If you were doing all this for me,
[1709.36] then you were doing wrong.
[1716.80] I have nothing for you in my heart.
[1727.88] I was only tolerating your
madness out of humanity,
[1733.84] and as soon as I got a clue about Usama,
[1741.64] I brought him in front of you.
[1744.52] I was going to tell you everything.
[1749.88] Yes, we are not divorced yet
[1752.08] but I have spoken to
the lawyer for separation.
[1759.40] Hmmm,
[1761.72] I don’t give anyone free advice.
[1765.56] But,
[1767.56] since we had a very beautiful
relationship in the past,
[1772.96] I’ll give it to you.
[1779.80] Return to your husband and son.
[1784.12] There’s nothing left for you in my heart.
[1793.52] Ghaznavi.
[1794.72] Jaffar.
[1796.64] Ghaznavi.
[1808.32] You couldn’t make your own home,
[1810.12] and you cannot see anyone
else’s home being made.
[1812.36] So right.
[1816.20] I will not let your home be made.
[1818.48] I will rest when
I take you out of Ghaznavi’s life.
[1822.04] You’ve tried so hard already.
[1824.88] If there’s still any desire left,
then try again.
[1828.80] Get out.
[1831.16] Get out from here.
[1834.64] I really like seeing this jealousy of yours.
[1840.80] Ghaznavi has already
admitted in front of me that
[1842.72] he does not love you.
[1844.92] No one understands this better than me.
[1848.20] If you have understood it,
[1849.36] then accept it as well.
[1910.32] Sir, you knew
[1912.76] Madam Farah was lying to you?
[1917.16] Yes.
[1918.76] I always stay with you like a shadow,
[1923.12] still you hid everything from me
[1926.08] and you said that you are investigating.
[1932.56] Had I told you,
[1933.92] then how would you have
complained to your madam about me?
[1937.24] No sir,
[1938.92] I don’t like you being with
someone else other than madam.
[1947.40] Your madam is a bit suspicious.
[1951.92] If she asks questions, please testify.
[1956.48] Yes sure.
[2028.52] You know, I have never clarified
my integrity in front of anyone until today.
[2036.76] But with you, it’s different.
[2046.68] I can’t bear your displeasure,
[2054.32] so I must provide evidence.
[2062.28] Take a look once.
[2065.44] If you still believe I’m guilty,
[2069.16] then I accept whatever punishment you decide.
