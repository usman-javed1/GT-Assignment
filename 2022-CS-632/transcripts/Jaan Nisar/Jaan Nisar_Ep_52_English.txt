Sir, order. Hmmm. Just bring a strong cup of tea. Okay, sir. Hello. I thought I would appreciate 
you on your performance. Thank you. You have completely surprised me. Just to raise suspicion in Nosherwan's 
mind and re-enter Dua's life, you went as far as divorcing Fiza. I mean, you are smarter than I expected. Look, the thing is, I'm not in the habit of nurturing tension, and I'm not one to forgive those 
who challenge me. Now the score with Fiza has been settled. As for Dua, she humiliated me in front of 
my own people, and I’ll make sure to settle that score 
by completely destroying her. You are playing well. Just continue your performance like this. Then, no one can stop you 
from becoming rich. Yes, that’s how it is. I just need your guidance. I am with you, at every step. Because the purpose of my life 
is the same as yours. Dua’s destruction. It is fine. Tell younger madam to come 
and have tea with us. She will not come. Why? I don’t know, she is a little disturbed. Disturbed? Why? Is she feeling alright? Did you say something to her? Why would I say anything? Does she not have enough caring 
people to say things to her? You say what you want, clearly. I know you don’t like Dua 
because she is my love. Remember one thing, it is not possible that you say 
something to me and I blindly believe it. It will never happen. I have no such illusions, Nosherwan, that I could come and 
say anything to you, and Dua would be removed 
from your heart. But the fact remains, doesn't it, that the importance you give her, she doesn't give you in return. I know well how much Dua loves me 
and how much importance she gives me. For this, I don’t need a certificate 
from you or anyone else. You know it so well, so tell me, why did she secretly 
meet her brother-in-law? Oh, sorry. He is no longer her brother-in-law. He has divorced Fiza now. Had he not done this, then how would he marry Dua? And, I think he came here 
to tell her all this. Sarfaraz came here? When? In the morning. Didn’t Dua tell you? I thought you must be given 
all the information. And Nosherwan, if you don’t believe me, you can ask the guards and watchman. And ask them a little strictly. Dua had given them some money
to keep their mouths shut. What did he say? He was convincing Dua. He was telling her, that I have divorced Fiza, now you too take a divorce 
from Nosherwan, so that the two of us can become one. He was saying he was not able 
to live without her. He loves her a lot. And Nosherwan, 
the way she was standing quietly and didn’t even tell you, it gives the impression that she agrees. Who let Sarfaraz come inside? Sir, younger madam asked us to let him in. Why did you not stop her? Sir, it was younger madam’s order,
how could I stop him? Nosherwan, why are you scolding these poor people? These poor souls are just slaves to orders. You two leave from here. Yes sir. You don’t trust me, at least trust what these people are saying. When will you understand? Dua is playing with your emotions. What I said yesterday is 
the same thing I'm saying today that I love you and I want to marry you. And if I married Fiza, then it was only because I had 
pressure on me from people. What happened? 
You didn’t come to have tea. I had a headache. Any special reason for the headache? Did something happen? No. Nothing special. Did someone come to meet you
at home today? No. No one. You are lying! Why would I lie? Sarfaraz came to meet you today. Any special reason for hiding it? Why did you not tell me? I didn’t want that he is mentioned 
in front of you again and again, and you get worried. Jaffar was not at home, 
so I thought that you won’t find out. That’s why I even told 
the guard not to tell you. That man proposed to you 
and went from here. He said that he divorced your sister 
so that he could marry you. Tell me, is this a lie? Is this something so small 
that you hide it from me? Please, I just wanted to 
keep you away from stress. Stress? The truth is that your actions 
are stressing me. Are you doubting me? Yes, because you have forced me to do this. I was going to tell you everything. I want to tell you everything 
but at the right time. I didn’t want to worry you. I myself am really worried. Over there, Fiza is not talking to me, she doesn’t want to see 
my face and Sarfaraz… If you had nothing for Sarfaraz in your heart, then why did you let him come inside? And why are you lying to me? I didn’t let him come inside. 
I don’t know how he came inside. Really? Who told the watchman 
to let him inside? I don’t know. 
You are lying again. I am not lying. You can call the guards
and ask them. After questioning the watchman, 
I’ve concluded that you’re betraying me. So stop it now. The truth is out in front of me. The truth is that you are misunderstanding me. Why did you people lie to Ghaznavi? Why did you say that 
I called Sarfaraz into the house? I had told them to say this. You people can leave from here. Sure Madam. So, all this is your game. Yes, and how did you like this game? Did you like it? Can I ask you the reason? You can surely ask. You are the one 
who started this game, Dua. I am just putting my share in it. And I thought there was also 
a need for my share. How did you like it, huh? You stay away from my matters. Hey, how do I stay away like this? If these matters had pertained to you, 
I would have stayed away. This is a matter of my husband. And till the time you remain stuck 
to Nosherwan Ghaznavi, I cannot stay away from this matter. Is this your plan? Yes. That’s the plan. You know, you are really intelligent. You understood my plan so quickly. And if you were not intelligent, then how would you have 
trapped a married man, and gotten married to him? But don’t worry, till the time I don’t distance you 
from Nosherwan, I too will not sit peacefully. And why do you worry? You have Sarfaraz as an option. You can go to him, 
you can settle with him, yes? I wish you too were a little intelligent, then you would have understood 
that Ghaznavi doesn’t love you. End the game you have started. I have never challenged your position. You too don’t do it. It makes no difference to me, 
whether he loves me or not. I am his wife and I will not surrender till the time
I don’t distance him from you. Why don’t you go to the mansion? You really love the mansion 
and the wealth there, yes? I have immense love for the mansion, the grandeur, the wealth, but even more for Nosherwan Ghaznavi. I can’t tolerate him staying here with you. Fine, I can make a sacrifice for you. If Nosherwan goes and stays 
in the mansion with me, then you can stay here with your lover, 
what’s his name? Sarfaraz. I will not mind. This is just your wish that Ghaznavi will go with you. It will remain a mere wish. It is not a wish, Dua. It is hope, and the world runs on hope. Sania. Sania. Bring it, child. Sister, come on, have food. I am not hungry. How are you not hungry? Come on, eat a little. In fact, I will feed my daughter 
with my hands today. Sister, stop it. 
Don’t cry like this. If you cry like this, 
it will hurt us. Greetings. Greetings. -Hey, Fiza…
-Fiza. Mama, what has happened to her? Why does she leave 
as soon as I come? If she does this, won’t I be the only one who ends up
looking guilty in everyone's eyes? You are innocent yet 
you are her sinner, Dua. You are my mother. Will you still say this? Yes. I am your mother, but I have also given birth to Fiza. I feel the pain of both my daughters. Dua, the truth is, that Fiza is suffering the punishment
for your sins. Mama, you know that I am really ashamed. What use is your shame to us? The damage that was to be done 
to Fiza has been done. Fiza has been ruined. I wish… I wish you had not opened the back door, then all of us wouldn’t have been 
suffering from this pain today. Dua… Dua, you are somehow responsible, 
for all of this. All of it. He was convincing Dua. He was telling her, that I have divorced Fiza, now you too take a divorce from Nosherwan, so that the two of us can become one. He was saying he was not able 
to live without her. He loves her a lot. And Nosherwan, the way she was standing quietly and didn’t even tell you, it gives the impression that she agrees. I have brought him, sir. Yes? Why did you call me? Why did you come home yesterday? Okay, this means that Dua told you. I want to hear it from you. Hey, what do you want to hear? 
It would have been better that Dua had told you everything herself. But, fine, since you’ve gone through 
the trouble to call me here, I will tell you everything. Yes, I did come to your house yesterday. I came at Dua's request. 
She called me. Now, if you want to know 
what we talked about there, then the summary for it is that we had an incomplete love 
and we want to complete it. Now, in this matter, 
if I can divorce her sister, then can't she get a divorce 
from you for my sake? Now, look, think about this 
calmly and peacefully. There is nothing to get 
so upset about this. Why are you trying 
to take control of her? Yes, she used to love me, 
she wanted to marry me, she had to marry you out of helplessness, because of my stupidity, or else you were nowhere in between. And now if Dua wants me 
to come back into her life, why are you causing hurdles in the middle? Why are you causing us pain? I still haven’t given you pain. Yes and if you give me pain, then I will not be the only one 
who will feel pain. She too will feel the pain, and the thing is that if the two of us live together, 
that has our happiness in it. And it was my job to lift the veil 
from your eyes, which I have done. Now, it’s up to you. I think it would be better if you separate
your paths from her and divorce her. Think about this. Anything else? You can leave. I will go now. He spoke way beyond his limits, sir. He has said so much. 
There must be some truth in this. If you tell me, 
I will remove him from the way. Not yet. Don’t cause him any harm till
the entire truth is in front of us. Keep an eye on him. He is lying. 
He is speaking nonsense, sir. Madam. 
Yes? Tell me the dinner menu 
so that I start preparing food. For dinner, do one thing, make kebabs, along with pilaf, and chicken, and also grill some fish. Yes, Madam, it will all be done. Stop. Yes, Madam? I think you should make 
grilled chicken for dinner. Sir really likes it and meatballs filled with eggs 
are also his favourite. So, prepare what I have asked you. Okay? Sure. Do one thing, 
prepare what I have told you. Okay? Sure, Madam. When I told her the menu, then what was the need to change it? Look, the thing is that 
this is not your mansion, where the servants follow your orders. So what if this is not the mansion? The servants are still ours, aren’t they? A servant is a servant, and a master is a master. The servant has to obey 
the master no matter what, whether it’s in a mansion 
or anywhere else. Absolutely. But, Madam Kashmala, 
this is my home. Here, the servants listen to me. You give orders in the mansion. What are you so proud of, Dua, huh? Nothing at all. I just want to make you understand that no matter what you try, you cannot snatch Ghaznavi from me. By constantly reminding me of my defeat, you’re forcing me to win, Dua. What if I defeat you in such a way, that you are not left with anything? Dua, what happened? What happened to her? How would I know? She was fine till now. 
She was talking properly. Dua, what happened? -Nothing. 
-Are you fine? Yes. Come on. Come to the room. Yes, I did come to your house yesterday. I came at Dua’s request. 
She called me. Now, if you want to know 
what we talked about there, then the summary for it is that we had an incomplete love 
and we want to complete it. There is nothing to worry about. This is good news. What do you mean? She is pregnant, and you are going to be a father. I will prescribe some medication, you just give it to her on time. And a healthy child will be 
added to your family. I will take your leave now. Take care of yourself.
