[20.00] Who are you to decide my marriage?
[22.27] I will do whatever is needed,
[23.87] and Uncle, you must listen too,
[25.13] your daughter will only get married to me,
[27.27] even if you tried,
[28.63] I will pick her up and take her away. 
How dare you?
[47.50] You are talking about taking a girl away
from my village in front of me?
[52.67] How dare you?
[55.07] What do you think, I will spare you?
[67.83] No, Sir, No, have mercy, Sir,
[71.10] Dad is lying,
[75.43] I love him.
[82.47] And if Dad gets me married to 
anyone else apart from him,
[85.60] I will take poison and die.
[90.33] If you want to shoot, 
shoot both of us.
[96.23] If we cannot live together,
[98.37] we can at least die together.
[100.07] You shameless woman!
[101.70] Why didn’t you die before doing 
such a shameful act?
[103.80] She hasn’t done anything wrong,
[113.40] She just implemented her right.
[117.33] she has the right to marry 
by her choice
[120.57] and what is your objection 
when your daughter
[123.40] and this boy is ready to get married?
[126.43] Sir, how should I get her married 
to this lazy guy?
[129.07] How can I just ruin my daughter’s fate?
[131.07] He doesn’t do any work.
[136.03] Why don’t you work?
[137.83] I am looking for work, Sir,
[139.50] I will do it as soon as I get it.
[142.53] Hmm,
[144.33] will you get your daughter married
to him if he gets some work?
[153.27] Sir,
[154.93] I will, when he gets a job but 
I know he won’t do any work.
[159.33] Just consider he got a job.
[162.87] Come to the mansion from tomorrow,
[164.87] Jaffar will let you know your job.
[167.80] Thank you so much, Sir,
[169.13] Thank you so much.
[170.73] The boy got the job,
[173.10] start the wedding preparations now.
[175.87] And there is no need to beat
[177.97] or imprison your daughter, next time.
[184.77] Get your daughter married 
where her heart wants,
[188.67] hmm?
[194.37] Long Live Sir!
[195.93] Long Live Sir!
[197.87] Long Live Sir!
[199.70] *chanting continues*
[220.63] She is so beautiful, right?
She is so beautiful,
[223.87] look at her hands, 
they are as white as milk.
[225.53] Yes, she is very beautiful.
[228.57] Who are you guys praising so much?
[230.33] Sister in law.
[231.67] Sister in law?
[234.60] What do you mean? Oh so you guys
 are back from there?
[236.77] We saw her and we liked her as well,
[238.87] she is very beautiful.
[241.37] I admit, you have learned to lie.
[244.23] I don’t lie.
[245.97] No, no, she is not lying at all
[247.63] my daughter in law is very pretty, 
very beautiful.
[252.97] Oh okay,
[255.13] so that means you have already 
made her your daughter in law?
[258.27] She was so beautiful, 
I immediately said yes,
[261.27] I really liked her.
[263.23] Who is this fairy-like
[265.77] that you guys have been 
parsing for so long?
[268.30] She is separately false praising her.
[271.03] I am not false praising,
[272.90] shall I show you the picture right now?
[274.70] See,
[280.67] did you see how beautiful she is?
[282.17] yes, they are very modest 
and conservative people,
[286.10] and my daughter in law - to be 
is also very modest.
[289.97] They don’t even get pictures clicked,
[294.40] I asked for her picture
[295.93] but they refused that we don’t have
 this tradition here.
[299.33] They refused but I cleverly took it
secretly, no one found out.
[303.27] Hey, don’t discuss this in front of 
Fehmida or her husband even by mistake,
[308.77] they might dislike
[310.57] that we have taken their daughter’s
picture without consent.
[313.27] Greetings.
[314.47] Greetings, Dad.
[315.43] Greetings. 
Greetings.
[317.23] Come, come, sit. 
Go get water.
[319.07] I will get it.
[326.60] It looks like you guys have 
come back from the girl’s place.
[329.77] Yes, yes, I did,
[330.93] in fact, I have also invited them 
to come to my place
[333.27] so they can see Sarfaraz once.
[335.53] Oh that’s great that 
you invited them
[340.03] and I am happier about the fact that
[343.20] it looks like you liked 
the girl at first sight.
[347.50] To be honest,
[348.83] I really dislike those families
[351.33] who would go to see the girl and 
would just come back after eating,
[354.67] it feels like they have gone to choose
 the sacrificial animal instead of a girl.
[360.07] Doing tea and refreshment 
in the match-making process
[364.40] pointlessly drains the white-collar families
[366.83] and the girl stays at home as well.
[368.87] You are so right.
[370.40] Okay tell me did you tell them
[374.43] we don’t want dowry?
[376.47] No, I went there for the first time,
[378.07] how could I mention this?
[379.53] and we are not making any demands 
for the dowry to them,
[382.73] we cannot stop them from giving 
their daughter what they want.
[388.67] By the way, you are right,
[391.63] but when they will come here
 I will inform them
[395.17] that we don’t need the dowry at all,
[398.67] They should just relax and 
get their daughter married.
[403.33] Thank you, daughter.
[406.43] This world will become so beautiful
[409.33] if every person starts 
thinking like you, Dad.
[412.80] I also have a lovely daughter,
[415.50] that is why I can feel the pain 
of other’s daughters.
[420.60] Shall I make tea for you? 
Will you have it?
[422.70] I will definitely have it if 
my daughter is making it for me.
[427.17] I will just get it.
[433.90] Fahad is calling, 
I will go and talk.
[441.07] Hey, tell me,
[443.40] what does Sarfaraz 
think about the girl?
[447.17] That is what I was noticing
[449.90] that he is not very happy,
[451.73] I think he is not mentally ready
 to get married
[455.57] but it’s okay, I will talk to him.
[463.87] Piping hot.
[465.20] Look, you are not cooking with heart, 
Fehmida Begum,
[469.13] there is less salt and more spice.
[473.47] Okay, I don’t know how that happen.
[476.07] Yes, you don’t know anything about
what happens in the world.
[480.23] I will be careful next time.
[483.10] And listen,
[484.27] did you reprimand Nasiban
[487.13] for bringing the guys casually like this?
[490.07] Yes,
[491.53] actually Aunt Nasiban had to 
go somewhere in the evening
[496.17] so that is why they came
[497.77] and sister Kausar was apologizing.
[500.17] Okay
[501.33] so what did they say? 
When will they respond?
[505.37] They really liked our Fiza. 
why wouldn’t they?
[508.60] They said yes and also 
invited us to their home.
[512.77] Okay then,
[514.40] do one thing,
[516.10] tell them
[518.17] that my daughter’s won’t come 
in front of any man.
[521.13] yes, but they didn’t say 
any such thing
[524.30] that their men will come 
to see Fiza,
[527.20] obviously, Aunt Nasiban 
must have told them
[530.90] about the mentality of 
this house and you.
[532.90] That’s good.
[536.03] Mr Aslam,
[537.60] if it is a yes from you,
[539.50] should I send a message 
through Aunt Nasiban.
[543.13] Yes, I guess
[545.03] Friday would be fine.
[546.43] Tell them that we won’t come 
untimely like they did,
[549.60] we will come at the time of Asr.
[552.40] Okay fine.
[554.57] Have salad too.
[559.20] Hey give me the money 
Mr Maqsood has given
[562.50] so I can add them to the accounts.
[567.73] What happened?
[570.30] Give me the money.
[580.83] Hunh?
[582.20] What is this?
[590.83] 5000 Rupees?
[592.87] He told me he had given 
25000 Rupees
[598.17] so he has lied to me,
[601.07] let me ask him right now, 
what is this way?
[604.13] There are so many liars 
in this world, right?
[607.80] Dad, don’t call him.
[610.77] Hunh,
[612.00] why not?
[614.83] He came to the shop and
 gave me 25000 rupees.
[618.80] if he gave you 25000 rupees 
so where is the rest of the amount?
[623.93] Hey I am asking you something,
[626.17] where are the remaining 
20,000 rupees?
[629.60] Dad, I spent them.
[631.77] Spent them?
[633.23] Where did you spend them?
[636.07] I got out on my bike, 
it stopped working
[640.03] so when I got it checked, 
it turned out that
[641.90] there is a problem in the engine,
[643.83] and then you know another 
work comes up from one,
[646.40] so this entire thing costed me 20,000.
[648.27] You spent 20,000 rupees 
on the bike?
[650.93] So what else should have I done?
 I was helpless, Dad.
[652.80] Helpless, how?
[654.73] You roam around here and 
there on the bike all day,
[657.97] you don’t get anything out of it,
[659.80] and on top of that 
you spent the money
[662.47] from the shop on your bike, 
20,000 rupees.
[664.63] so, what else should have I done? 
Where else would I get the money from?
[667.27] Do some work then!
[669.00] When I ask you to sit at 
the shop it's against your standards,
[673.37] if you don’t want to sit at the shop
[675.73] and do some royal job 
then at least look for one.
[678.40] So then I will look for it.
[680.27] You will look for it?
[684.03] Look at your son,
[686.17] you want to marry him,
[689.33] you are looking for
 a daughter in law,
[691.07] just think again before ruining 
some girl’s life.
[695.13] So like I am dying to get married.
[697.90] I don’t want to get married right now,
[699.77] I will get married when I get a job,
 I will find it myself.
[702.77] He just taunts me on 
everything for no reason.
[704.47] Did you see his attitude?
[706.43] It feels like we are not taking care of him
but he is taking care of us instead.
[710.00] So what?
[711.33] He is a young boy
[712.87] and they have a lot of expenses,
[715.13] he did tell you though that 
where he spent the money,
[717.97] he didn’t spend it on partying,
[719.70] he only used it for his motorbike.
[721.37] Even if he spent some money, 
what’s wrong with that?
[725.70] You have no value of 20,000 rupees?
[729.17] You are calling it some money?
[731.17] Even Nowadays it’s a person’s 
full month’s salary.
[736.13] Sometimes you look like 
a vendor to me.
[740.73] Wow,
[743.70] they don’t understand
[745.43] how much time it takes to 
earn 20,000 rupees.
[752.97] if Dad gets me married to 
anyone else apart from him,
[755.77] I will take poison and die.
[757.23] If you want to shoot, 
shoot both of us.
[765.23] If we cannot live together,
[767.17] we can at least die together.
[773.97] Please Farah, quiet now, 
what’s wrong with you?
[776.23] with me, after betraying me big time
you are asking me to get quiet?
[780.57] I didn’t betray you, 
I have been betrayed.
[787.20] I didn’t know that they were calling me
back from the hostel to the mansion
[789.50] to get me married to my sister in law 
right after her waiting period is over,
[792.33] I had no idea about it.
[793.67] Nosherwan, you could have refused.
[796.03] I did refuse,
[799.23] I did it multiple times,
[804.73] there were a lot of guests at home
[808.03] so I couldn’t put Baba Saeein’s honor at stake.
[810.53] There are other people in the world 
whose sister in laws become a widow too,
[814.10] they don’t just get them married 
to their brother in laws.
[817.13] I know that,
[821.73] Farah, I didn’t want to betray you 
so I am telling you beforehand.
[824.83] you know what,
[826.13] all this wouldn’t have happened 
had you spoken
[830.13] to your Baba Saeein about us earlier.
[834.83] Okay, I will talk to Baba Saeein again.
[837.63] What will you say now
[839.83] when you never spoke to him 
about us earlier.
[843.13] And what do you think
[844.63] your Baba Saeein got you married to your 
sister in law for the sake of his family’s honor,
[850.07] now will he let you divorce her?
[852.50] Or will you go against your Amma Saeein and
Baba Saeein and divorce your sister in law?
[861.20] I don’t know
[864.63] but I will tell Baba Saeein that 
I love you a lot,
[867.10] I cannot live without you.
[868.67] I am sure he will listen to me.
[872.53] You will have to live without me,
[875.90] because you know Nosherwan
[877.50] I can’t share you with anybody else,
[880.13] you know that.
[882.97] Relax.
[884.43] Farah, listen to me,
[886.43] you cannot leave me like this, 
I am saying I will talk to him.
[889.07] You have separated our ways,
[892.40] not me.
[901.17] Farah please,
[903.17] don’t leave me like this.
[906.30] Farah, listen to me,
[907.43] I am saying something to you.
[924.50] At least someone should 
get their love,
[928.40] why do I miss you again and again?
[964.70] Hello?
[968.10] The whole day has gone by, 
what is this behavior?
[971.37] I was waiting for your call for so long.
[974.23] Actually,
[976.30] Mom saw the phone.
[978.20] Oh yes, No, I kind of got 
an idea at that time,
[980.37] That is why I didn’t call back
[982.60] but still
[984.17] you have made me wait for so long,
And I have waited a lot for you.
[987.23] How could I call you 
in front of everyone?
[989.70] I just got a chance right now.
[991.23] Yes.
[993.23] Anyway, tell me how did you satisfy Aunt?
[996.40] I told her that it is Rida’s phone 
and I would return it to her tomorrow.
[1000.90] Look, now you have to be a bit cautious,
[1003.77] you have to be careful.
[1005.93] Leave that to me.
[1007.50] Oh yes, I can leave this to you
[1010.53] but I cannot leave you.
[1012.83] Anyway, my day wasn’t good today,
[1015.87] I was very restless,
[1018.27] I was just thinking what must 
have happened to you all day,
[1020.73] I was worried for you.
[1022.80] I hope Mom didn’t scold you much.
[1026.07] No,
[1028.67] what are you doing?
[1030.67] Nothing,
[1031.90] I was just missing you.
[1036.20] Why didn’t you sleep yet?
[1038.10] When do I have sleep in my fate now?
[1040.80] Ever since I have seen you,
[1043.27] my eyes always hope to 
see you somehow,
[1048.33] I just want to see you.
[1054.30] Is that how much you have 
started to love me?
[1056.20] Yes,
[1058.20] but the question is,
[1060.87] do you love me as well?
[1068.73] I won’t tell.
[1161.90] Rida? Rida, Rida, Rida, look at this.
[1164.70] Faraz gave it to me.
[1165.83] Faraz has gifted it to you?
[1167.60] So soon?
[1169.47] I mean Fahad was very miser,
[1171.90] he just gave one gift in 3 months and 
that too was a very useless one.
[1175.73] I told you,
[1177.93] Faraz is different.
[1179.33] Oh please,
[1180.87] everyone looks nice 
in the beginning,
[1182.83] you get to know the reality later.
[1186.50] Don’t you think that you have 
become a bit rude
[1190.57] after breaking up with brother Fahad?
[1193.60] Yes, maybe.
[1195.03] Anyway, forget about me,
[1197.03] tell me about yourself, 
now you have a phone,
[1199.37] you guys must be chatting 
at night now, yeah?
[1202.20] No,
[1203.43] you know the environment of my house,
[1205.60] when everyone goes to sleep, 
I have to wait,
[1208.33] I am just able to talk to him after that
but that too for a very little time.
[1211.40] Look at your eyes, 
they look full of sleep
[1214.73] but you also have to come 
to the University
[1217.00] else how will you meet Faraz?
[1219.17] No, I don’t meet him
[1222.70] and by the way, Dad has warned me
[1225.13] that he will get me out of the university
if something happens again.
[1229.10] I will have to sit at home then.
[1230.57] Your Dad is actually very strict.
[1232.80] Very much. 
Okay listen,
[1234.77] tell me it’s functions, 
how does it get silent?
[1237.27] I don’t understand anything.
[1238.77] What’s so difficult in it?
[1240.27] I will do it right now.
[1241.93] All the phones have the same settings,
[1244.73] you are using it right now so you will 
face a little difficulty in the beginning
[1248.13] but then it will be fine.
[1250.53] Okay, tell me,
[1252.03] what did Faraz say 
regarding marriage?
[1253.83] Will he marry you?
[1256.83] He said he will just marry me,
[1260.20] even if someone else forced him,
[1262.30] he still wouldn’t marry anyone else.
[1264.17] Really,
[1265.27] wow Dua,
[1267.20] your luck is shining.
[1269.20] Tell me how to do it?
[1283.60] Did you return the phone 
to your friend?
[1286.53] Oh God, Mom,
[1287.97] you start interrogating me 
before I even enter home.
[1293.23] Answer to the question I asked.
[1297.40] Yes, I gave it back.
[1300.20] Open your bag and show it to me.
[1303.20] You will check my bag?
[1306.47] Don’t you trust me?
[1309.40] Show me your bag I will be able
to trust you then.
[1327.47] Are you satisfied now?
[1329.73] You don’t trust your daughter at all.
[1335.07] A daughter’s mother even has 
to trust with their eyes open.
[1342.90] Change your clothes, 
I will take out food for you.
[1347.47] Okay.
[1386.77] Sir, this year the crop has been 
cut before the rain this time,
[1392.47] that saved the crop too
[1394.77] and we the profit has been 
more than 4 crores too
[1398.83] and this is the amount 
for the sugarcane crop
[1403.80] and it 6 times more than last year.
[1408.60] Okay, keep it in my room, 
I will check it.
[1411.60] Okay sir.
[1418.47] Sir, food is ready,
[1420.33] Bibi Saeein Jr has gotten 
all your favorite food made.
[1433.07] the president has called me,
[1435.77] I will have the food with him.
[1442.13] Say thank you to your 
Bibi Saeein Jr on my behalf
[1445.30] and ask her not to wait 
for me and eat.
[1447.60] Okay Sir.
[1463.93] It would have been so nice had Mom
and dad taken us with them,
[1467.73] we would have seen 
brother groom as well.
[1469.37] Yes.
[1470.53] you should be thankful Mom 
and dad didn’t listen to this
[1473.40] else you would have gotten a 
flying sandal coming towards you,
[1475.97] it would have been so much fun.
[1478.33] By the way,
[1479.57] brother groom is very handsome,
[1481.30] Dad will like him too.
[1483.23] How should I accept,
[1484.43] you guys didn’t even 
show me a picture.
[1488.37] Where are you going?
[1492.20] I am going to the roof to study.
[1494.70] It’s almost evening,
[1495.77] Dad wouldn’t like it when 
he comes back and sees you,
[1497.20] he already doesn’t like you 
going to the roof.
[1500.10] I feel that Mom and dad doesn’t 
generally like me at all.
[1505.67] In fact, sometimes I feel I am not 
their biological daughter.
[1509.47] You make everything complicated,
[1511.30] I was saying this for your own good
[1515.43] but no you have to make 
an issue out of everything.
[1517.90] Even you have to scold me
over everything.
[1521.13] Okay now if the teacher may allow me,
[1524.50] can I go to the patio at the back 
and study?
[1526.33] I hope you won’t get mad then?
[1528.27] Go and you have your finance paper,
[1531.13] take your book.
[1532.87] Thank you.
[1542.30] Hey Mr Aslam,
[1544.07] I am very glad you came to 
our home on our invitation.
[1546.83] We are very happy to meet you 
and your son as well.
[1551.10] That is your greatness.
[1552.87] Have something.
[1554.57] Yes.
[1557.10] Okay brother Aslam 
and sister Fehmida,
[1559.53] we want the marriage 
to be a little soon,
[1562.03] tell me whatever you guys have planned.
[1564.37] When do you want the wedding?
[1565.57] We were thinking of next month.
[1570.17] Next month?
[1571.90] Brother, isn’t that too early?
[1574.80] How will we do the preparations?
[1576.50] Sister Fehmida,
[1578.10] look we don’t want dowry
[1581.37] and whatever clothes and 
important things
[1584.37] our daughter wants to bring 
with her is up to her.
[1594.17] We don’t have any demands
[1596.37] but if daughter Fiza wants 
to bring something herself then…
[1604.17] he is so weird,
[1605.53] he asks me to call him,
[1607.30] and now when I am calling 
he is not picking up.
[1609.17] Okay, date, what date are you guys
 thinking of?
[1613.27] Date I was thinking that
[1615.50] since all of us our together 
so let’s collectively decide a date.
[1621.23] No problem.
[1622.87] Son, whose call are you 
disconnecting again and again?
[1626.23] Friends are bothering me,
[1629.40] I told him you guys are coming
to see me today so…
[1632.63] the boy is very good-looking.
[1634.63] Hmmm.
[1636.23] Have something, son.
[1643.17] Dua?
[1644.97] Yes?
[1647.87] Dua? 
Yes? yes?
[1651.07] I thought you must be 
craving tea while studying
[1654.03] so I have made strong tea for you.
[1655.97] My lovely sister, 
do you know
[1657.70] if there are two to three sisters 
in the house like you,
[1660.30] all the problems will be gone. 
ill-mannered.
[1707.20] I have heard you have made 
a very good decision
[1708.93] at the village council yesterday?
[1710.73] Hmm,
[1712.37] I am proud of my son.
[1714.97] The right to marry by her choice 
was being taken away from a girl,
[1720.43] you have earned reward 
by uniting two people
[1722.87] who were in love with each other.
[1728.10] that is what I expect from my son.
[1733.87] Now you can take very good care 
of the mansion.
[1740.30] No Baba Saeein,
[1742.57] I will take care of the matters of the city,
[1745.63] you are here to take care of the mansion.
[1750.57] You have to come back here though, right?
[1761.83] You get the food served.
[1771.20] Go Kashmala,
[1773.00] get the food served.
[1774.17] Sure, Amma Saeein.
[1775.20] I have eaten with the president 
of the council.
[1789.73] Kashmala is still hasn’t eaten 
as she was waiting for you.
[1794.80] Mom, I said I will eat out.
[1799.47] She made all your favourite dishes 
with all her heart.
[1809.87] Look Nosherwan,
[1812.87] the decision to marry Kashmala 
to you was purely ours,
[1820.33] we couldn’t have given Zavar’s widow
and the kids to any stranger
[1826.73] but that is the past,
[1830.80] the one who was your sister in law 
back then is now your wife
[1836.77] and you have some responsibilities 
towards her,
[1841.27] sit with her when you come 
to the mansion,
[1846.63] spend time with her,
 talk to her.
[1851.97] Has she complained to you?
[1855.73] The poor girl will never complain
[1860.30] but can’t I see her dull eyes?
[1866.17] I admit that
[1867.73] it is difficult for you to treat her 
as your wife,
[1869.83] who was your sister in law back then
[1874.60] but so many years have passed now,
[1880.10] forget everything
[1882.07] and start a new life with Kashmala.
[1885.57] Mom, there is nothing like this,
[1887.87] you are having illusions for now reason.
[1893.43] Okay, I will go rest for a bit.
[1895.43] Greetings.
[1911.70] I am hungry,
[1914.37] I haven’t eaten.
[1917.77] I know,
[1919.93] Amma Saeein told me,
[1923.07] who you have complained about me.
[1925.13] No.
[1927.00] I didn’t complain.
[1929.37] So you should have eaten,
[1933.53] I didn’t stop you before eating.
[1936.80] You are so stone-hearted, 
Nosherwan,
[1940.27] I got the food made with 
so much love and affection,
[1944.03] that we… 
Why do you do all this?
[1947.77] What do you think,
[1950.67] you will forcefully become 
my wife by doing all this?
[1953.13] It is not about forcing,
[1958.00] I am your wife.
[1959.20] I don’t accept this relationship
[1964.30] where two people are forcefully tied 
with each other.
[1974.33] People respect you a lot,
[1979.00] they consider you a very good son,
[1983.40] the villagers trust you,
[1987.97] you are loved by everyone.
[1990.90] But just think
[1993.00] when they will find out
[1995.77] that a guy who is all for justice and 
truth hasn’t given the right to his wife,
[2007.60] what will they think?
[2010.73] They will laugh at you.
[2016.70] They would stop trusting you.
[2020.03] What do you want?
[2023.87] I should stop coming 
to the mansion?
[2029.70] Let me know if that’s how it is, 
I will do it.
[2032.50] How can you do this, Nosherwan?
[2035.37] If you do this, I will tell everyone
[2038.27] that I am married to you but
you still don’t give me my right.
[2041.47] You have said this today,
[2047.50] don’t say it ever again,
[2053.73] because next time you will even 
get deprived of this relationship
[2057.07] that is based on papers 
if you say something like that.
