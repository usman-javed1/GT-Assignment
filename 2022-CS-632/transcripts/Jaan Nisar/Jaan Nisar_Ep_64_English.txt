Hey, Madam, go easy with the oil. We don’t have a well of oil in our house, so as soon as the oil finishes,
we’ll go and fill it from there. You have to spend the entire month 
with this oil only. Mom, tell her to cook the meat properly, otherwise, we’ll have to wrestle 
with the pieces while eating. Her mom didn’t teach her anything
 while sending her to her in-laws, she just taught her how to have 
an affair with our brother. She tricked our brother 
and got married to him. Girls these days are only interested
in chatting on Facebook and WhatsApp, trapping boys in their web, and then getting them to marry. They have nothing to do 
with household chores at all. Pay attention to the curry, don't listen to what we're saying, 
it will burn. Here we go, a new drama has started. Now she'll play the victim 
and show her husband that because of his family, 
her hand got burned. Hey, whether she burns 
her hand or cuts it, we just want food, I'm hungry. It feels like eating food has 
become a distant dream. Hey, nothing ever happens on time anymore. Your daughter-in-law is so lazy. Mom, along with being lazy, 
she's quite the drama queen. It's these very dramas that 
she used to trap my brother. What wrong have I done to you people? You never miss a chance to taunt me. Alright, stop it now. There's no need to act like a victim.
Stop the drama, never miss a chance to taunt me. Here we go, now deal with her tantrums! She is such a drama queen! Nosherwan, if you've now decided to divorce Dua, then stay firm in that decision. Don’t make yourself weak like this. Mistakes are made by humans, but if you wear the mistake like
a necklace around your neck, you'll spend your whole life 
burning in the fire of regret. What are you upset about? You have Kashmala, the kids, and your whole family is with you. Accept it, accept that the girl wasn’t right for you. You made a mistake in choosing her. But now, if you’re getting a chance 
to correct that mistake, don’t waste your life like this. Come on, get up, go eat. Kashmala has already served the food. No, Mom, I am not hungry. I won’t eat. I think you need a change of environment. We're all going back to the mansion, and you should wrap up your work
and come with us. A change of environment 
will bring your heart at ease. No, Mom, I won’t go to the mansion. I don't feel at home there. What have you gained by staying here? She’s left spears pierced 
through your heart. What will people say, that Nosherwan's wife, our daughter-in-law, turned out to be of such low character? Dear, small issues happen in every house,
there are ups and downs. You should have approached it with patience. You left the house over 
such a small matter, especially at a time when 
Khizar wasn’t even home. It wasn’t a small matter, Dad. Those people made my life miserable. Now, if neither of them is getting 
proposals or getting married and are both sitting at home, 
then how is that my fault? I haven’t put any obstacles 
in their proposals. Dear, tell me, didn’t Khizar lay 
everything out before marriage? Didn’t he tell us everything? In fact, he said he didn’t want
to get married right now because his two elder sisters are at home. And he was well aware of the temperaments
of those sisters and his mother. Considering this, 
he made a wise decision, but you were in a hurry. You first pressured him to get married and then forced him to bid you off. So whose mistake was it? It was your mistake, right? So, when you have made this mistake, then you should start practicing
patience and tolerance. So, if their daughters don’t get married, would my daughter wait her entire life? You got her married, right? You have sent your daughter off 
to her in-laws, right? Now, the daughter also needs 
to prove her wisdom, and if she wants to maintain her relationship, then she should act with patience. No! They also need to be more open-hearted, how long would she keep 
listening to their taunts? I was telling you people from the beginning
not to make a relationship there, but who listens to me here? I didn't find him suitable from the start. Khizar is a very good and composed boy. Your sister will have to handle 
things wisely and with patience if she wants to maintain her 
relationship there. So, what else should we do? She does so much for them, 
yet they aren’t happy with anything. Should she just die? Sacrifice her life just to please them? Listen to me, have you forgotten all of Fiza's services? Hey, she used to wake up every morning
and make breakfast for everyone first. After that, she would go to school, and after coming back from school, she would cook food for everyone. You, mother and daughter, 
would rest all day, while she worked like 
a servant without a break. Yet, you were never satisfied 
with her services. Now, how did Fiza's name 
come into this issue? Yes, how can he not remember her? He has seen my face, because the moment he sees my face, he thinks of Fiza. This is too much! Instead of resolving your daughter's issue, you remember that girl who is 
no longer even our daughter-in-law. Parents all over the world 
support their children, while you are the only one 
who keeps criticizing your own children and constantly lectures them. Hey, mothers like you are the ones 
who ruin their daughters' homes. Keep quiet, I'll talk to him. Don't worry. Yes, Madam, did you call for me? Are the papers ready? No, not yet. Why not? Umm, because the lawyer has gone out of town. So, what if the lawyer is out of town? Isn't there any other lawyer in the city? No, Madam, Sir specifically asked for that lawyer. Okay, but he must have an assistant, Jaffar. Get him on the phone to talk to Saeein, the papers can be prepared like that, right? Yes, Madam, how can I advise Sir? He does whatever he pleases, 
I'm just a servant of his orders. He specifically asked for that lawyer, but that lawyer has gone out of town. Is the lawyer really out of town, or are you deliberately
delaying things, Jaffar? No Madam, why would I delay things? It’s okay, don't tell me. I will find out for myself whether the lawyer is really 
out of town or if something is fishy. And Jaffar, if I discover 
that this is all your doing, just remember what I'll do to you. Dear Khizar, you did well 
to come to pick up Sumbul, otherwise, I was coming myself to drop her off to you. Sumbul didn’t do right 
by coming here, whatever argument 
she had with Mom and sisters, at least she should’ve waited 
for me to come home. You’re right son and we were also trying 
to explain this to Sumbul. She shouldn’t have left the house like this, especially in your absence and without asking for your permission. She made a big mistake. But you are sensible and by coming here, 
you have shown a lot of wisdom. Your mom and sisters do not 
like my daughter at all, they can’t stand her. They keep taunting her 
from morning till evening. If my daughter shouldn’t have come here, 
then tell me, where else would she go? Why don’t you rein in your mother 
and sister’s tongues? Aunty, I try very hard to avoid any arguments
between Sumbul and Mom or sisters, but you also need to understand that Sumbul should take care 
of her responsibilities. If she completes her work on time, she won’t give anyone 
a reason to complain, then no one will say anything to her. Look, Mom is getting older, and if she doesn't get her food 
on time and says something, then what was the need to 
argue and come home? Why? Is my daughter a maid in your house? Or has she taken on the responsibility 
of serving your mom and sisters? If they enjoy eating food so much, then she has two daughters 
of her own as well, tell them to cook! Was food not prepared in your house
when Sumbul wasn’t there? Tell me one thing, when you took my sister from this house, did you take her as a wife or as a maid? Mr. Sarfaraz, you also please 
answer me one thing. I've been visiting this house quite often, so I’m not a stranger and I’m addressing both of you. Is Fiza the daughter-in-law 
of this house or a maid? Stay within your limits, understood? This is my personal matter. You should also stay within your limits. She is my wife, 
she came here upset with me, I am her husband,
and I will make it right. Please shut up your nonsense. How can I stay out of this matter, huh? We're talking about my sister! Sister-in-law Fiza was 
also someone’s sister. Do you have no empathy for 
another woman’s suffering? And now that it’s your own sister, 
you’re shouting so much? Huh? Sarfaraz, go inside. What else do you want to talk to him about? He’s saying whatever comes to his mind,
and you’re listening to him? Why are you giving him 
so much importance? I told you, I’m talking to him! 
You go inside! Sumbul isn't going anywhere! She will stay in this house! That house is hell for her, hell. Fine. Then keep your daughter, sir, 
my apologies, and you keep your sister like 
a statue in front of you. Goodbye. Khizar! Khizar, son! Tomorrow is Zawar's death anniversary. How can we leave Nosherwan alone? Nosherwan isn’t ready to go to the mansion, and in his current state, 
we can’t leave him and go. Saeein, I was thinking of organizing 
Zawar's anniversary here this time. I’ll call the mansion, and they can arrange 
the Holy Quran recitation there too. Yes, maybe that… that would be better. I spoke to Nosherwan. He's not ready to leave here. Kashmala, you make arrangements
for the final prayer recitation. We’ll also need to arrange 
for the communal meal and food and clothes will be distributed as well. Oversee everything yourself. I don't want anything to go wrong. Don’t worry, Amma Saeein, I’ll take care of everything. Only God knows what is destined for us. One son has already left this world, and the other has turned his back 
on the world while still being alive. I don’t know when this trial of
our children will finally end for us. Why didn’t anyone tell me 
that Khizar came to pick me up? Oh, I was just about to tell you, but then Khizar and 
Sarfaraz started arguing. You know how Sarfaraz is, once he starts, does he listen to anyone? When he had already come to pick me up,
why did Brother have to create a scene? Now Khizar isn’t even answering my calls! Whatever he said, 
he said out of love for you. What kind of love is this 
that is ruining my home? Mom, if anything else goes wrong in my life, I’ll never forgive my brother. Oh please, now don’t put 
all the blame on Sarfaraz. You were the one who fought 
with your mother-in-law and sisters-in-law and 
came back to this house. You were in such a hurry to get married, but you didn’t learn anything before leaving. At least you could have made them 
breakfast on time. You must not have found time 
from all the sleeping, right? And Fiza… Fiza did all the work here but never once complained 
about you not working. And Khizar? Khizar came and kicked your lazy behaviour. There was Fiza, who used to go to school in the morning but still made breakfast before leaving, and then she would come back 
from school and cook meals. Yet, she never uttered a word. And then there’s you! Now Fiza has become the good one 
just because she’s not here anymore, and I’ve become the bad one 
because I came home. When a daughter comes back home, she becomes a burden, doesn’t she? Where did being a burden come from here? You were so desperate to get married. You rushed into it, you should’ve at least learned 
something properly. And now, after fighting there, 
you’ve come back here, and you’ve made your father, brother,
and husband fight amongst themselves! They’ll keep fighting and die! Let me tell you one thing clearly, don’t come back to this house 
after fighting at your own home! Got it? Keep your fights in your own house! You’ve spread chaos in the house. Hello? Yes, Jaffar, go ahead. Uh, yes, Madam, whatever needs to be done, 
please do it quickly. We don’t have much time. Sir has already instructed me 
to prepare the divorce papers for you. I delayed him, Madam, 
by telling him that the lawyer is out of town, but I won’t be able to hold him off
for much longer, Madam. You did the right thing, but why didn’t you tell me this earlier? Yes, Madam, I didn’t get the chance, or I would have told you earlier. Okay, fine, I’ll handle it. One more thing, Madam, Madam Kashmala has 
become suspicious of me. We’ll need to make a move 
before she does something. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it as soon as possible. Yes, Madam, goodbye. Why is his phone off? Listen, it’s 2 o’clock in the night, and Sarfaraz still hasn’t come home. His phone is off too. He doesn’t usually do this. 
I don’t know where he has gone. He must be hanging out 
with his friends somewhere. He’ll come back. 
Why are you so worried? You don’t sleep yourself, 
and don’t let me sleep either. But his phone is off, 
and that’s never happened before. His phone’s battery must have died. Okay, do one thing, call his friends. Is this the time to be calling anyone? Besides, I don’t have the numbers
of his friends. I only have Fahad’s number. I’ll call him if you say so. Yes, yes, call Fahad. Ask him if he’s with him and if not, get the numbers of his other friends 
and find out where he is. I’ll ask him to message me the numbers
of his other friends if he has them. Is the phone off? Yes. Greetings, Fahad, son. Sorry to bother you this late, but I had to ask, has Sarfaraz come to your place? Son, it’s 2 a.m., 
and he hasn’t come home yet. His mother is worried. Do me a favor and text me 
the numbers of his other friends, will you? Okay, son, thank you. Thank you. It’s been five years since Zawar left us, but it doesn’t feel like he’s not here with us. My heart is heavy too, Saeein, but we have to live the life 
that God has written for us. You don’t worry too much, I’ll take care of the Holy Quran recitation
arrangements downstairs. You just rest. Alright. Elder Sir, Mr. Jaffar has come twice since 
this morning to give you this diary, but you were resting. He left the diary with me, asking me to give it to you 
once you wake up.
