[32.28] We've changed so many doctors,
[35.16] but our daughter's health hasn't improved.
[42.36] The doctor has advised some tests,
[45.68] but the facilities aren't available here.
We'll have to go to Karachi.
[53.56] Yes, so, we shouldn’t delay,
[57.20] if that’s the thing.
[59.48] I will make arrangements for you people
to go to Karachi, immediately.
[75.92] Saeein, won't you go?
[81.40] No,
[83.76] there is some important work here,
[90.04] and then,
[92.00] even my health doesn’t allow it.
[98.16] You go with Kashmala.
[105.16] Then, Nosherwan is also there,
you will not feel my absence.
[113.84] Baba Saeein, you were not well,
you have just gotten better.
[117.32] If we go like this, then
we will remain worried for you.
[121.88] Let’s get Mizna checked in a local hospital.
[125.40] I won't tolerate any kind of negligence
when it comes to our daughter.
[131.12] Okay.
[133.36] But,
[134.68] I cannot leave you and go like this.
[138.56] Why are you talking like a child?
[142.28] Right now, nothing is more important
than our daughter’s health.
[146.56] Nothing will happen to our daughter.
She will be fine,
[149.84] and Kashmala will take
the children to Karachi.
[164.48] Nosherwan and Dua are there,
[166.56] they will take care of them,
and they will handle everything.
[168.96] I will stay with you.
[171.84] Kashmala will need you there.
[174.88] So, we will stay in touch,
[177.56] but I cannot leave you and go.
[180.40] Baba Saeein, Amma Saeein is right.
[184.12] I will also have peace of mind about
the mansion if Amma Saeein is with you.
[195.40] I…
[196.84] I will take the children to Karachi, alone.
[205.16] You people have started
to consider me a child.
[210.52] Fine,
[212.56] as all of you wish.
[219.96] I will call Nosherwan,
[223.04] you start your preparations.
[224.52] Sure.
[253.36] When you know that my fate is so good,
[257.48] then why do you make such efforts?
[259.56] Kashmala, everyone in this house
loves you so much,
[264.52] they care for you so much, but you...
[266.52] Only you.
[270.04] I don’t have a problem with anyone else.
[273.88] I only have a problem with you,
[277.24] and if you too leave Nosherwan’s life,
[283.48] then this hatred will also end.
[286.96] This wish of yours cannot be fulfilled.
[329.84] How are you?
[341.04] Sarfaraz.
[349.48] This is for you.
[354.60] What is this?
[358.64] The company has fired you.
[365.04] And the reason for it?
[367.00] The company no longer needs you.
[372.40] You can leave.
[378.48] I want to meet Ghaznavi.
[386.00] Hmmm.
[388.32] Come with me.
[408.52] He wants to meet you.
[422.16] Why does he want to meet me?
[430.40] What happened?
[432.48] Are you not happy with my work?
[435.36] You fired me.
[441.48] The company no longer needs you.
[446.16] Is there no need,
[448.96] or are you bringing personal
matters to the office?
[465.12] It would be better for you if you
stayed away from personal matters.
[470.32] Obviously,
[472.76] you are rich,
[474.92] you are powerful.
[480.44] You can do what you want.
[488.88] When you know,
then stay away.
[490.88] Yes, so I was far.
[494.44] Now, what do I do?
[496.16] Fate brought me close to Dua itself.
[509.48] Don’t take Dua’s name,
I am making you understand.
[517.24] What’s in the name?
[520.12] Although I know everything about her
like the back of my hand, but anyway...
[536.32] Look, you came into her life now.
[544.60] Fine,
[546.08] you impressed her with your wealth,
[549.60] but I had nothing.
[556.04] But despite that,
[559.48] my name was on her tongue.
[561.60] If you order me, then
I will kill him right now.
[564.08] Wow. Wow.
[566.24] Amazing.
[570.28] You are more loyal than
the king himself.
[572.88] Fine.
[574.04] Back then she was not aware
of your true nature.
[576.80] Yes, but that doesn’t make a difference.
[585.60] The truth is,
[589.76] she came in my share first.
[625.52] If you even say a word about Dua,
[630.48] I will empty all the bullets down your throat.
[637.16] You leave him, sir.
I will take care of him.
[639.96] Pick him up and throw him out.
[642.36] Out.
[643.16] If he is seen around the office
in the future, shoot him.
[658.40] I want to forget,
but he is in front of me.
[663.16] I want that….
[664.44] What do you want?
[667.00] I want him to suffer a painful death.
[672.44] And Fiza?
[677.20] Have you thought
what will happen to her?
[680.20] I was thinking about her for so long.
[685.08] I was quiet for so long,
thinking about her.
[696.40] Get out!
[701.88] Even if I see you near
this office in the future,
[707.00] then I will shoot you in the chest.
[709.76] Understand?
[711.20] Remember that I will not leave you people.
[714.48] I will make each one of you
cry tears of blood.
[716.44] Out.
[741.40] Forgive me, daughter Fiza.
[748.76] You have truly been subjected
to a lot of injustice.
[756.56] I will not influence any decision of yours,
[768.48] and neither will I ask you to forgive Sarfaraz.
[784.28] Hey, he is your criminal.
[786.84] You can punish him as you want.
[800.44] The real sadness is that my son
was never worthy of you.
[812.36] Uncle,
[813.48] I have no complaints against you.
[817.48] Believe me…
[819.40] believe me, I was not aware
of this sin of Sarfaraz.
[825.08] I was not aware.
[840.00] Hey,
[841.80] if possible…
[844.36] if possible, forgive me, Brother Aslam.
[847.56] Hey, why are you making me
a sinner Brother Naseer?
[849.64] Get a grip on yourself.
[857.88] Here I am, in my old age,
[860.64] having to endure humiliation
at the hands of my son.
[872.12] I should just die.
[887.40] Hey, I am also your criminal Brother Aslam.
[892.52] You can give whatever punishment you want,
[896.28] to that criminal,
with regards to your daughters.
[909.64] I…
[910.56] I will never stand up in his support, ever.
[914.32] I will never.
[916.96] No. No. Brother Naseer,
[919.28] this is Fiza’s decision.
[929.36] She will decide
[931.36] and we will support her.
[935.16] If she wants Sarfaraz punished,
then I will get him punished.
[949.00] I will support every decision
of daughter Fiza.
[954.80] Yes, we will support every decision
of yours, daughter Fiza.
[975.20] See,
[976.84] she has become completely lost.
[979.92] She has become completely lost.
[982.60] She cannot tolerate the shock.
[986.20] She is unable to tolerate the shock.
[1053.16] She is feeling somewhat
better than before,
[1055.96] but we can only be sure
once the reports come in.
[1059.48] Yes,
[1060.60] thank you, doctor.
[1076.16] Greetings.
[1077.68] Greetings.
[1078.52] How is Mizna, now?
[1080.84] Yes, she is better.
[1083.24] The fever has gone down.
[1090.28] Thank God.
[1092.04] I got worried that
this little doll was unwell.
[1107.36] What do the doctors say?
[1109.28] They are saying the reports
will come tomorrow,
[1110.88] they will decide after that.
[1116.72] You people have been here for so long.
[1119.96] If you want, then you can go home
and rest. I will stay here with Mizna.
[1124.00] No, I am here.
[1126.64] Kashmala, I think you should go.
[1132.20] We will have to stay here for two days.
[1134.08] I am with Mizna.
[1137.56] I will not go anywhere leaving
Mizna in this condition.
[1148.48] I will remain worried for her.
[1151.68] How can I go home and rest?
[1155.32] If you people want to go,
then go ahead.
[1158.24] I will stay here.
[1160.20] I am telling you, I am here.
[1161.68] So, you don’t need to worry.
[1163.92] You can leave.
[1165.16] As long as you're here,
I feel reassured.
[1175.76] But I will still worry about Mizna.
[1178.56] After all, I'm her mother.
[1189.72] Only a woman who has been
a mother can truly understand
[1197.04] what it means to be a mother.
[1225.12] Sir,
[1228.12] the doctor is calling you.
[1255.60] See, this soup is so good.
[1258.60] Now, Mizna is feeling better.
[1260.84] If Mizna drinks a little more soup,
[1263.28] then she will get even better.
[1272.20] A little.
[1273.24] A little. Very little.
[1303.88] Come on, one more sip?
[1306.36] A little.
[1332.88] Greetings Amma Saeein.
[1334.36] Greetings, Grandma.
[1336.04] Greetings. Live long.
[1337.88] My doll is fine. Huh?
[1341.40] How are you now, my love?
[1343.04] I am absolutely fine, Grandma.
[1346.76] Nosherwan, what do the doctors say?
[1349.24] The reports are all clear.
[1351.28] The doctors have called her
for a routine check-up in two days.
[1353.32] They have discharged her right now.
[1354.64] You gave me really good news.
[1357.24] Yes, thank God.
[1359.00] Or else, I was really worried.
[1361.56] I know.
[1362.72] Till our daughter doesn’t completely recover,
[1365.56] you have to take special care of her.
[1367.04] Don’t worry at all, Amma Saeein.
[1369.32] All of us will take a lot of care of Mizna.
[1374.04] Goodbye.
[1377.56] Thank God.
[1398.76] Bring water.
[1400.88] Mama.
[1402.32] Sumbul. Bring water.
[1408.16] Hey, someone bring me water.
[1411.96] Hey, bring water.
[1413.96] Mama.
[1415.36] Yes, Brother.
[1417.00] Water.
[1418.12] I have called out six hundred times
to bring water.
[1424.16] Fiza has spoiled you by
following your every command.
[1428.52] She's completely messed up your mind.
[1435.96] Now will you shout at your mother
and sister like this?
[1439.96] At least, I didn’t have to tell her,
[1442.00] everything was done on time.
[1443.64] Here, the throat dries, asking for things,
but no one listens.
[1446.20] No one does my work.
[1447.28] So, bring her back if she comes.
[1452.36] Mama, look, my mind is already
in a whirl today, I'm really stressed out,
[1455.48] and now you're giving me
all this talk on top of it.
[1462.28] I should go and bring her back
[1463.48] Okay fine,
I will not say such things.
[1466.32] Tell me, did you find a job?
[1468.72] I didn’t. I didn’t find a job.
[1470.88] I am just giving interviews.
[1478.80] Did you find a job or not?
[1480.92] Your father’s shop has been rented out,
[1483.68] and now we’ll have a fixed
income coming from there.
[1490.48] How will we manage with such little money?
[1492.16] It will be really difficult for me.
[1500.04] It is really important for you to find a job.
[1502.52] I am trying, what else do I do?
Do I hang upside down?
[1505.76] What else do I do?
[1507.00] Hey, so why are you getting upset like this?
[1509.12] What is wrong?
[1511.08] Take care of this file of mine,
[1513.16] I have an interview again tomorrow.
[1515.92] And listen, I am hungry.
[1519.24] Bring food in the room,
along with raita and salad.
[1527.00] I shouldn’t have to ask you a hundred times.
[1530.24] Bring it now.
[1535.48] This boy has so many tantrums.
[1538.84] It was just Fiza who was tolerating this boy.
Oh God. Oh God.
[1543.16] Now go, give him food
[1545.12] or he will start screaming again.
[1563.72] Hey, I was looking for you.
[1566.80] I have heard Nosherwan has
put this big home in your name.
[1572.72] Hmm?
[1576.08] Yes, you have heard it right.
[1578.04] Oh wow,
[1580.32] what else have you made him
put in your name?
[1582.84] Tell me.
[1592.88] Ghaznavi gave me his name.
[1600.04] He gave himself to me.
[1602.76] That is enough for me.
[1604.96] Oh,
[1607.36] I had an idea about this.
[1609.80] When the incident with
Sarfaraz occurred,
[1612.44] Nosherwan didn’t utter a single word.
[1619.40] And your sister left her home and
came to stay at her parents’ home.
[1624.24] Such a big enmity was created.
[1629.40] Obviously, she couldn’t tolerate it
either that her husband,
[1632.92] Sarfaraz, was once your boyfriend
and who knows what else.
[1642.92] But you’ve certainly cast some sort
of spell on Nosherwan, haven’t you?
[1657.56] What do you want to say?
[1659.52] Meaning, my love,
I have come here now,
[1666.76] so you start packing
your bags gradually. Okay?
[1674.16] Because now I will live here,
and you will go from here.
[1706.88] Nosherwan.
[1768.16] Yes?
[1769.28] What is the matter?
[1773.96] Sit.
[1779.36] Sarfaraz, don’t worry.
[1783.04] You will not be at a loss talking to me.
[1786.72] I want to talk to you about
something important.
[1803.64] Yes?
[1805.36] What is the matter?
[1807.72] You didn’t mind me making you
sit in the car like this, right?
[1813.80] Get to the point.
[1817.00] You seem angry.
[1822.20] Obviously,
[1824.32] when you have to go around
aimlessly looking for a job,
[1827.48] you get angry.
[1830.64] Yes, after all,
[1832.24] Ghaznavi fired you from the job.
[1842.32] How do you know Ghaznavi?
[1847.40] I even know you really well.
[1855.12] Fiza’s husband,
[1858.60] Dua’s ex-boyfriend.
[1863.56] Is this much reference enough, Sarfaraz,
[1867.68] or do you want more?
[1873.04] Fine, I accept you know a lot about me,
[1878.80] but why did you reach out to me?
[1883.00] I want you to do something.
[1884.72] Something very important.
[1887.92] Okay,
[1890.36] and why do you think
I will be of help to you?
[1894.60] Because you are used to shortcuts.
[1897.20] You enjoy shortcuts.
[1899.52] You want to become rich overnight,
you want to be successful, and I…
[1903.96] I can help you with this.
[1907.48] I can make you rich and…
[1911.48] and I will pay the price you want.
[1915.48] And Sarfaraz, the matter doesn’t end here.
[1918.44] It is possible that you will
get your old love back.
[1926.00] Old love?
[1927.88] Dua.
[1929.40] Your old love.
[1933.76] I never loved Dua,
[1936.96] and now…
[1938.60] if you ask me about now?
[1940.52] I hate her now.
[1941.96] Then let it be hatred.
[1944.76] She humiliated you so badly
in front of the entire family,
[1950.96] that you must want
to take revenge on her.
[1960.28] And along with taking revenge,
[1964.16] you will also have a lot of money.
[1969.64] Can I ask why you want to be
so kind to me?
[1973.16] Because in return for this kindness,
you will also do a kindness towards me.
[1979.12] I...
[1981.24] I want to remove Dua from my path,
[1987.36] and I know, you can do this easily.
[1993.84] You even know about Dua.
[1997.32] What is your relationship with her?
Who are you?
[2002.76] I…
[2005.76] I am Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s first wife.
