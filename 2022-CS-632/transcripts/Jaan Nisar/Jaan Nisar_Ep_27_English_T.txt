[33.88] This is your third call in so long.
[37.12] Because I am worried about you.
[39.64] I feel you are not well.
[42.36] I am fine.
[46.16] You tell me,
[48.04] how do I make you believe?
[50.48] When you are fine,
[52.64] I get the vibes myself,
[54.88] and I don’t get them right now.
[58.28] Even the party is really boring
 I am leaving from here.
[63.28] Fine, come.
[65.72] When you are in front of me,
[66.68] you will believe me. Right?
[83.76] You be ready,
 we will go somewhere.
[87.48] Right now?
[88.92] Yes, right now.
[93.56] When you are with me,
[95.84] then I don’t realize 
how time passes.
[102.48] Fine.
[142.16] How are you, Ghaznavi?
[173.40] Did someone pressure you to do this?
[183.96] Don’t be afraid.
[185.28] Give us your statement fearlessly.
[190.36] Why don’t you 
agree to what he says?
[193.72] Sarfaraz.
[194.64] Sarfaraz.
[195.24] Sarfaraz.
[196.04] I will not let you leave 
the home and go.
[197.40] For God’s sake, don’t go.
[198.24] Whatever is happening with me,
[199.16] is because of you.
[200.48] Leave me.
[202.92] Sister-in-law!
[207.72] Did you fall yourself
[209.96] or did someone push you on purpose?
[229.00] I had fallen myself.
[231.16] Don’t be afraid, Fiza.
[232.60] We are all with you
[234.56] and the law will protect you.
[239.96] I am speaking the truth.
[241.96] I fell myself.
[245.64] Fine.
[247.28] We hope you are not lying to us.
[250.16] But we have recorded your statement.
[252.64] We will go now.
[269.92] Girls like you hit your foot 
with an axe yourself.
[351.12] Hey, I was going to call you.
[353.52] Hey, we will go for 
the outing some other time,
[354.72] not today.
[356.88] No problem.
[358.40] I got ready when you asked me.
[360.16] If you don’t want to go,
[361.32] then we won't go.
[363.40] Yes, I don’t know, I have a headache.
[365.12] You have a headache?
[367.56] I will bring the medication.
[369.44] Yes. I will rest.
[372.36] Please, no one should disturb me.
[397.68] How are you, Ghaznavi?
[400.16] You have not changed at all.
[403.60] You are handsome just like earlier.
[414.92] Say something.
[417.68] What do I say?
[422.56] Ask me how I am.
[424.52] What is the need to as you?
[427.60] I can see it.
[430.72] One should not judge the state 
of the heart by outward appearances.
[437.88] Neither have I changed,
 nor my love.
[441.04] You cheated me and went away.
[445.04] I cheated you?
[451.72] I told you everything 
honestly and went.
[456.72] You are the one
 who left me and went.
[461.32] I am here now.
[462.52] Hah,
[463.32] you are forgetting,
[467.40] you are married.
[468.88] Why am I talking to you?
[469.92] Listen to me once.
[483.76] I ended that marriage.
[492.28] I made a hasty decision to
 forget your unfaithfulness.
[496.40] But, I ended everything 
as soon as I realized it.
[500.92] There is no point in all this,
[503.48] I am married now.
[505.36] Your will wasn’t part of that marriage.
[508.28] You were forced to accept it,
[510.28] and you have admitted 
this in front of me.
[512.72] I admit this in front of you even today.
[516.76] But the marriage I am talking about
[520.76] is the one I have 
now done with my choice.
[532.56] Marriage?
[536.56] Love marriage?
[543.92] No.
[546.76] You…
[548.36] You are joking with me, right?
[551.84] No.
[554.64] Ghaznavi,
[557.20] I am your choice.
[559.00] How can you change 
your choice so soon?
[562.68] Soon?
[565.24] I think you are forgetting,
[568.04] what you are calling early,
[569.08] it has been ages since it happened.
[572.04] Still I am not willing to accept this.
[576.92] Our love was not so weak that
[579.80] you forget it easily,
[583.96] and a man doesn’t forget 
his first love so easily.
[593.04] I am your first love
[596.16] and you cannot forget me so easily.
[612.40] I had said
[612.92] no one should disturb me.
[619.44] You, leave.
[633.00] Does my presence also disturb you?
[637.56] I didn’t mean that.
[640.08] You have a headache, right?
[642.24] Take the medicine, have tea,
[644.36] and you will see
[645.08] how the pain disappears.
[653.68] A man doesn’t forget
 his first love so easily.
[660.20] I am your first love
[662.04] and you cannot forget me so easily.
[667.20] Here you go.
[669.20] I will take it in a while.
[672.84] Eat it,
[674.16] then have hot tea,
[675.40] you will really like it.
[686.48] Did something happen?
[689.24] No. Nothing happened.
[690.00] What happened?
[697.52] Are you worried?
[701.00] I have never seen you
 this worried ever before.
[705.80] Before today,
[706.64] even my past hadn’t walked
 in front of me like this.
[714.20] What happened?
[717.04] Nothing, maybe I am tired.
[719.32] I will rest.
[754.60] I am going to talk to Baba Saeein 
about your and my relationship.
[760.04] Really?
[762.68] Really?
[767.68] But if he doesn’t agree, then?
[774.24] Still, no one can
 separate me from you.
[778.04] Promise?
[780.44] I promise
[783.68] and you know
[784.60] how much I live up to my promises.
[843.44] A man doesn’t forget 
his first love so easily.
[878.52] Come quickly, we are getting late.
[880.68] Put it on this side.
[887.20] Quickly. Quickly.
[887.92] Hey, where are you going?
[890.60] Won't you have breakfast?
[893.32] No, I am not in the mood.
[894.96] Eat something.
[896.52] You have it, please.
[897.16] I will meet you in the evening.
[906.00] Jaffar.
[907.08] Yes?
[909.84] What happened yesterday?
[911.52] Yesterday?
[912.72] Yes, yesterday.
[914.76] Nothing at all.
[918.80] Are you speaking the truth?
[920.44] Why will I lie to you?
[927.48] I am getting late,
[930.44] sir might get upset.
[932.28] I will go now.
[939.40] Did something happen?
[940.60] No. Nothing happened.
[941.28] What happened?
[941.96] I have never seen you 
this worried ever before.
[946.00] Nothing, I think I am tired.
[963.68] Fiza, child,
[965.72] you should have stayed in 
the hospital for a few more days.
[969.16] You really need to rest.
[973.24] What will I do by resting?
[975.60] My loss will not be repaid.
[980.92] Child, your health 
is also really important.
[986.44] I will go home and rest.
[992.48] Fine, then,
[995.60] come with me.
[998.36] I will go to my in-laws home.
[999.88] Don’t insist child.
[1001.80] If you go to our place,
[1003.04] I will be able to take
 care of you better.
[1006.56] When the one I had to protect,
[1008.00] is no more,
[1008.88] then what will you care for?
[1012.44] After all,
[1014.32] when I have to go there, then,
[1016.24] what will going to you 
for a few days do?
[1018.84] After all, Papa
[1019.64] doesn’t like me coming home.
[1021.44] Hey, child,
[1023.84] don’t take what 
he says to your heart.
[1026.40] You know his temperament,
[1027.92] he is like this.
[1030.76] I know.
[1032.36] I know everything.
[1034.84] This accident
[1036.72] has given me a big experience.
[1041.96] Okay.
[1043.96] Fiza,
[1046.96] child, why did you not
 tell the police the truth?
[1052.00] Your in-laws and your husband were
 pressurizing you to not give birth to this child?
[1059.64] If the bag is packed, then call him.
[1063.88] I want to go home.
[1073.92] I will see.
[1148.12] Hello.
[1149.28] Hello.
[1151.00] Tell your staff to at least 
bring me to your room.
[1159.00] To my room?
[1161.16] Yes, I am in your office.
[1165.72] Take care of it yourself, please.
[1167.80] Okay fine,
[1168.52] I will ask from the reception myself.
[1181.44] Excuse me,
[1182.28] where is Nosherwan’s room?
[1191.04] Yes?
[1192.64] Take her and bring her to my room.
[1194.08] I will just bring her.
[1196.72] Please, come on.
[1200.52] Sure.
[1201.08] Sure, please.
[1216.92] Hello.
[1219.56] Hi.
[1222.64] You are surprised seeing me as if
[1227.16] you have seen a ghost.
[1229.52] No, actually,
[1232.16] I was not expecting you 
to come here like this.
[1236.84] But, now, I have come.
[1241.68] Hmm.
[1245.24] Won't you ask me to sit?
[1246.92] Please have a seat.
[1254.64] Tea or coffee?
[1257.28] You know my likes and dislikes well.
[1263.92] The likes and dislikes of a person
 change over so many years.
[1269.12] Neither did I change,
[1271.40] nor my choice.
[1278.96] One black coffee and
[1281.12] one coffee with milk.
[1287.08] You haven’t forgotten anything.
[1291.36] I don’t want to remember.
[1295.68] You didn’t even change your number.
[1300.16] Had I known you would call 
and reach out like this,
[1303.40] then I might have changed it.
[1307.12] You cannot change.
[1311.28] You didn’t change your number,
[1313.76] because you had hopes that
[1314.92] I would contact you at one time.
[1319.68] One should not keep 
such high expectations.
[1325.64] Earlier, I just had faith,
[1330.60] but after meeting you,
[1333.40] and seeing you,
[1335.80] my faith has become stronger.
[1343.00] Even today, you only love me.
[1351.64] This is what you think,
[1354.36] not me.
[1357.96] A woman’s heart never lies
 in the matters of love.
[1391.20] A life spared is worth 
a hundred thousand.
[1393.36] It was so difficult to 
get them discharged.
[1397.04] I’ve clearly told them
[1398.64] that I don’t have enough money
 to cover hospital expenses.
[1401.96] Yes, so did the right thing.
[1404.16] What is the need to spend 
so much money on her?
[1406.80] The doctor had made complete
 arrangements to get us in trouble.
[1410.52] But Fiza acted smartly
[1412.24] and she didn’t give
 a statement against you.
[1414.92] Yes, so she should have made
 a statement against me.
[1418.76] I too had announced my decision.
[1420.88] Have you gone mad?
[1423.00] You would have had to visit 
the police station for no reason.
[1425.64] If I had to visit the police station,
[1427.68] then she would have stayed at 
her parents’ home all her life.
[1431.92] This is not the time to be emotional,
[1434.64] it is time to act sensibly.
[1438.16] I don’t know what 
the point of all this is now.
[1439.92] Hey, why is there no point?
[1441.88] It is a recent incident.
[1443.28] Right now, her parents became quiet,
[1445.80] but still, she is their daughter.
[1448.08] if Fiza gives a statement against you
[1451.04] then we will be in trouble.
[1453.04] I would suggest that right now,
[1455.72] take care of her.
[1456.84] Fix your behavior towards her.
[1458.72] Even if you do it for show,
[1460.92] show love to her, son.
[1462.40] Mama, I won’t be able to do all this.
[1466.20] You will have to do this.
[1469.68] I don’t know where
 Papa has trapped me.
[1473.84] Hey.
[1475.80] Oh God,
[1477.28] how do I make this boy understand?
[1544.04] Fiza,
[1546.36] how long will you cry like this?
[1553.76] Even I am really sad about
 whatever happened.
[1560.44] Why will you be sad?
[1563.96] This is what you wanted.
[1565.72] Hey,
[1567.64] I said everything in my anger.
[1569.72] I had no such intentions.
[1576.28] Look, I know that
[1578.72] you have been really
 hurt because of me.
[1583.60] And, I am really regretting it too.
[1589.08] Your regret will not fill my empty arms.
[1594.76] My child left the world 
before coming into my arms.
[1608.12] But Fiza, don’t worry.
[1611.32] I am with you.
[1613.96] God will give us another child,
[1617.84] and this time, I promise you that
[1621.12] I will really take good care of you.
[1630.40] Please.
[1632.36] Please, get a grip on yourself.
[1635.04] Everything will be fine.
[1659.12] This is good that Sister 
Marium paid the committee.
[1662.16] How many more 
committees of hers are left?
[1664.12] This is the eighth one we took, right?
[1666.24] Yes.
[1666.88] So, two are left.
[1668.52] Two are left.
[1669.88] Now I pray to God 
we get a rickshaw soon.
[1671.76] It is also really hot.
[1673.16] Yes.
[1675.04] Fehmida.
[1675.84] Isn’t that our Dua? See.
[1678.04] Hey,
[1679.36] this is my Dua. Dua.
[1681.08] Dua.
[1709.56] She blocked my number?
[1712.68] She took the money and
[1714.84] she didn’t even do the work.
[1717.00] I will not leave Zunaira.
[1723.24] Yes, go ahead.
[1724.52] Greetings, madam.
[1725.84] What do you want?
[1726.68] Tell me why did you call?
[1727.76] Farah has come back into sir’s life.
[1733.40] What are you saying?
[1735.88] How do you know?
[1737.00] Both of them were together 
at the party yesterday.
[1740.96] The news is confirmed, right?
[1743.68] Did you see both of them together?
[1745.40] I saw them myself,
[1746.60] and I am WhatsApping you the proof.
[1749.88] Well done.
[1751.60] You did a good
 thing gathering proof.
[1753.60] Send it. Immediately send it.
[1769.60] My senses were
 stunned when they heard
[1771.32] that Ghaznavi had 
given you my place.
[1775.32] But the ground will 
slip from under your feet
[1778.80] when you find out that
[1781.24] Ghaznavi’s old love has returned.
[1807.28] Mama.
[1810.16] Be quiet, Mama.
[1811.60] How long will you cry like this?
[1816.00] Hey,
[1819.56] my Dua.
[1822.20] My Dua
[1824.56] passed in front of my eyes
[1826.40] and I couldn’t meet her.
[1831.72] Did you see her properly,
[1835.56] was that Sister?
[1837.40] Yes,
[1839.60] it was my Dua.
[1842.40] How can my eyes deceive me?
[1846.52] You should have stopped her.
[1851.92] She was sitting in the car.
[1855.56] I tried.
[1857.68] The car left before
 I could call out to her.
[1862.28] But
[1863.04] where did sister get a car from?
[1866.60] I don’t know.
[1870.36] That’s what I am worried about too.
[1872.72] Hey, what sort of people
 is my daughter trapped with?
[1876.44] There was one more car,
[1879.08] it had people with guns sitting in it.
[1882.88] Mama,
[1885.80] hearing this,
[1886.88] even I am really worried for sister.
[1890.88] God knows what condition
 my daughter would be in.
[1893.88] My heart is exploding.
[1898.08] What can we do other 
than get worried, Mama?
[1902.48] No one will even 
be ready to help us.
[1908.16] That’s what I am worried about.
[1911.16] Papa doesn’t even 
want to see sister’s face.
[1915.76] His anger towards sister 
Fiza hasn’t even cooled down.
[1922.20] I don’t know what sort of fate 
my daughters have been born with.
[1927.48] They don’t have comfort in their fate.
[1932.84] Get a grip on yourself.
[1935.48] Don’t get disheartened like this.
[1937.76] Mama,
[1939.68] here, drink some water.
[1948.12] That’s it. Don’t cry.
[1957.08] The likes and dislikes of a person
 change over so many years.
[1960.08] Neither did I change,
[1961.40] nor my choice.
[1970.52] Earlier, I just had faith,
[1972.96] but after meeting you,
[1975.04] and seeing you,
[1977.00] my faith has become stronger.
[1979.72] Even today, you only love me.
[1996.12] Hey, you are back.
[1999.00] Yes, I had come.
[2001.88] Did you come from your shopping?
[2003.44] Yes.
[2004.68] I didn’t feel like it at all.
[2007.12] But since it was your order,
[2008.76] so I had to go.
[2010.28] You did good,
[2012.08] after all, you would
 have gotten bored alone.
[2015.68] I can wait for you.
[2018.64] I know.
[2025.72] What happened?
[2027.88] Is everything okay?
[2030.24] Hmm?
[2033.32] You are hiding something from me.
[2036.56] No, what will I hide from you?
[2039.60] why do you feel this way?
[2042.56] I don’t know.
[2044.88] But, I feel like
[2047.92] you are caught in some worry.
[2052.16] A man doesn’t forget
 his first love so easily.
