Look, I went to Dua’s home for 
her sister’s wedding yesterday, I think Dua has eloped and I thought she would be with you. Do you know, her father was so angry, he was investigating me, he was asking me to tell him who is 
his daughter having an affair with. And, and what did you tell him? What will I tell him? I was so scared that I didn’t even 
remember your name. Yes, that’s good, that’s good you didn’t take 
my name because I broke up with her a long time ago. What? Dua didn’t tell me any such thing. Yes, she wouldn’t have 
considered it important. And look, I am married now, so, I don’t know anyone related 
to this matter, and it will be better if you delete 
my number as well, and please don’t call me next time. Okay, okay, why would I need to stay 
in contact with you anyway? By the way, you should be grateful to me that I didn’t take your name 
in front of her father and also didn’t tell him 
you bought the phone for her. Yes, yes, I also want to say to you that, it will be also better for you to stay away 
from Dua and her family. Umm, actually the thing is, why do you
 want to call for trouble yourself? They will drag you into this matter 
for no reason. Why do I need to drag myself 
into someone’s matter? Anyway, I will hang up now. Rida? Rida? Yes? What is it? Just tell me one more thing, you were telling me that Dua’s sister
 got married yesterday, right? What is her sister’s name? Fiza, why? Bye. I don’t know why I feel like seeing you and meeting you again and again, this restlessness, this desperation 
is beyond my understanding. Now when I think about you, 
my heart starts beating faster, I can hear them clearly. You are not even aware of how 
desperate I am for you. Now I just have one wish, Dua, I have to meet you and 
make you mine. You wouldn’t even be aware 
of my feelings, but like it’s said if the intentions are pure, 
you succeed in your purpose. I will wait for you. I cannot hear Dua’s voice anymore. When we wouldn’t open the door, until when will she wait? She might have left. Mr. Aslam has been so cruel 
to my motherhood. Fehmida? You guys are still standing here? Yeah? Go from here. Come on. Manzoor, I knew you would be here. Get lost. Go away from here. Come on, get out of here, get out of here. what are you looking at my face for? I will give you a tight slap. What are you looking at? Who is it? Rida? Okay, okay, okay, tell me what is it? Why are you talking to me like this? Look, Dua, I am busy, so quickly tell me what you want. 
Why have you come here? Rida, actually, I don’t want anything, I have a request. Can you keep me in your house 
for a few days? I will leave as soon as I arrange something. Why? Go to your home. I did, but… 
Hmm, I am sure your father must have 
pushed you out of the house, right? You know it? Yes, I have suffered it. I went to attend your sister’s wedding and over there I found out that you ran away from home. And do you know how much your Dad 
insulted me because of what you did? Rida, please, I am really sorry, but you are my only friend, you, I will tell you everything,
 just listen to me once. Look, I have no interest in your story and I am not your friend either, understand? Now go away from here and forget I was ever your friend. Oh God, we tied this bond out of stupidity. Let Nasiban come, I will ask her if this family’s girl was the only 
one left to give to us. Enough, Kausar, you have been cursing 
the girl ever since then. You are telling this to me as well? 
You are saying things to me. Mom is right, how will we face people? Our girls cover themselves. Our girls don’t get pictures clicked. Our girls don’t keep mobile phones. If they don’t keep mobile phones, 
how did she run away? No, Dua didn’t have a phone, it was her friend Rida’s phone. I don’t understand why were 
you guys rushing with things. All this is the result of rushing into things. You guys should have first checked if the family is honorable or not from 
where you are bringing the daughter-in-law. That’s it, son, that’s the mistake we made. Enough, both of you! Enough! Fiza is not at fault in this whole matter. End this topic right here, understand? And you must go. I am asking you to leave. You too. And you, listen to me very carefully, if anything goes wrong, I will be the worst. Take care of daughter-in-law. Is that how much you love me? That you got scared hearing about me 
marrying someone else. I love you a lot. What are you thinking? I was just thinking I wish 
it was our wedding today. You look so beautiful, 
I can’t even tell you. Please, ask Aunt to come soon 
then we will leave. Please, believe me. my… 
Shut up! Just shut up. What are you doing? All this? 
What? Faraz? Don’t do this, don’t, please. I am tolerating you just 
because of my father, else I would have said the three words and set you free a long time ago. What is my fault in this? Shut up! No. What was the fault? He wanted peace. What was the fault of 
my innocent brothers? Jaffar? Yes, Sir. If they ask about me, 
tell them I am sleeping. Sir, madam is already mad at me. Hello? Jaffar? Yes, madam? What is sir’s phone doing with you? Umm, sir was resting and 
his phone was with me. I received it when your call rang. Make me talk to your sir. But he is sleeping. Wake him up if he is sleeping, tell him I want to talk. Madam, how should I wake him up, it was very hard for him to fall asleep, he was in too much pain. Jaffar, I know you are lying, your sir is not sleeping at all. Are you going to make me 
talk to him or not? Umm, madam, why would I lie to you? Okay, madam, I will ask him to 
talk to you when he wakes up. Jaffar, if you don’t make me talk to sir, I will complain about you to Baba Saeein. How can you complain about me 
to Baba Saeein over such a small thing? As soon as sir wakes up, 
I will make him talk to you myself. Jaffar? Jaffar? He is doing all this because 
he is encouraged by Nosherwan. By the way, sir, madam will kill me 
because of you someday. So, then you can give your life, you are always ready to give 
your life for me anyway. True that, sir, but my soul will wander here and there 
by being killed by the hands of a female. I want to introduce you to Mom. My family is forcing me to get married, I cannot wait any longer now. This color looks very nice on you and wear the same color
on our wedding day. Your lover sold you to me after counting all the money. Dad, please don’t leave me, please. Your father is dead! After what I heard today, even if I had a daughter 
she would have died too. If you take one more step
across this door, I will bury you alive. For God’s sake, 
let her come in. Get out of here. 
Dad, let me come in, I will tell you, Mom, it wasn’t my fault.
Enough is enough, there is no place for a characterless girl
like you in this house. We can sit inside and talk about 
whatever needs to be said. No, move, move back. 
Dad, listen to me, please Dad. Get lost. It means that sister-in-law is Dua’s sister
and you didn’t recognize her? How could I recognize her? I had a garland on my face, where the car stopped, which house we went to, 
which tent we entered. And I don’t recognize her family anyway, 
when did I ever meet them before? Okay why are you getting so angry? I am not getting angry, 
I am just saying that don’t say anything wrong, 
I am already very angry. Okay, relax, I won’t. Dua must have recognized you. I didn’t come face-to-face with her. What do you mean by you didn’t 
come face-to-face with her? She didn’t see her brother-in-law 
at her sister’s wedding? She would have only recognized me
had she been in the wedding. So where was she? It’s just, the way she was having an affair with me,
I don’t know how many more were there, she went to meet someone that day, and then she disappeared from there, when we asked the family, 
they said she is not well so she is not coming out, 
she is inside. The actual story was that she went 
to some immoderate place. The police raided there and the police arrested them. 
What are you saying? But she doesn't look 
that kind of girl to me. Hey, I used to feel the same, but feeling something and something 
actually happening are two different things. No, I mean, I am not convinced 
she is that kind of girl. So then don’t be convinced, but if you are not convinced 
that won’t change her reality. You mean to say you still 
haven’t confronted Dua yet and she doesn't know 
you are her brother-in-law? Yes, that’s how it is. So, now when you meet her it will be as a brother-in-law? I don’t think that will happen. Her father has cut ties with her 
so that won’t happen. Poor girl. Does she seem like a poor girl to you? Here my first morning after my wedding
has been ruined and became hell, and you think she is a poor girl. Only your morning has become hell, I feel her whole life will become hell. Did you, with her…? Am I the only person you got to blame? Are you my friend or enemy? Okay, why are you getting angry? I just had a thought so I asked. Keep your thoughts to yourself, 
understand? I just told you that I had no relationship with her, 
I broke up with her, and after that, I don’t know 
what happened, what she did. Kashmala? Yes, Amma Saeein? Sit, sit, you were having a headache, how are you feeling now? Yes, I am better now. You should have rested for a while. When do you get a chance to 
sleep well at the hospital? I did rest, Amma Saeein. Kashmala, you shouldn’t think so much, you will stay worried, that is why you have 
headaches all the time. You will get tired. Why tired? You all are my family. I just keep myself busy with work so I don’t get bored alone, all day. I can understand. Happiness has gone away from 
this house since Zawar left. It’s like autumn came and 
never left our home. And Nosherwan, he doesn’t think of anyone for months. I have told your Baba Saeein 
so many times to talk to him, that he should bring you 
and the kids here. We have such a big house and 
there is no one to live here, but he doesn’t listen, he just says I don’t have a 
permanent place to reside, and you and the kids will become her 
weakness because of so many enemies around. You are safer in the mansion there. Yes, but Amma Saaein, if you and Baba Saeein will force him,
he will agree. Tell him to live with us in the mansion, his life will also not be in danger there. We have tried that too, but he doesn’t listen. I don’t know what happened 
to him after Zawar, he has always been stubborn, but now he doesn’t listen to anyone. Come, let’s go. The bullet was shot in my hand, 
I haven’t crippled my leg. Let’s go. I just thought you might be 
feeling weak. I am perfectly all right, I will even take this off in 2 to 3 days. Let’s go before the doctor 
changes his plan. I have no interest in your story,
 understand? Now go away from here and 
forget I was ever your friend. My son is back home. They were to discharge you 
tomorrow, right? Shall I go back? Kashmala, Nosherwan has recovered and
 is back home, make arrangements for charity. Amma Saeein, I distributed 10 goats
to the poor people yesterday and I even got 1000 birds freed. Now that Nosherwan is home, we will do more charity tomorrow. I am in my room. 
I will rest for a bit. Jaffar, 
Yes, Sir, please help Nosherwan go inside, he shouldn’t be standing here
for very long anyway. The more he rests, the better it is for him. No Baba Saeein, I can walk, I don’t need anyone’s support. I got diet food made for you, I can get it served, you go and rest. Come, let’s serve the food, come. I didn’t feel so much pain from this bullet as much as I would feel seeing 
Kashmala in this room. After all, when will the test end? Fehmida, until when will you mourn? She is dead for us. Don’t say that. I don’t know 
what my daughter went through. She is not our daughter. She is not our daughter. The one who killed mine
and my family’s honor. She... She threw dirt on our faces and left. My heart is still not convinced, our Dua is not like that. You should have listened to her once. Why would I listen to her? Why? What do you want? I should have heard her truths and lies, and brought her back. She wanted to apologize, you should have given her 
a chance to clarify. I don’t want her apology, 
I don’t want it. Don’t be so harsh, Mr. Aslam. Fehmida, you are sitting at home, 
you don’t know anything, I am the one who steps out 
in the neighborhood, the people who used to look 
at us with honor, they make fun of me now, what do I see in their eyes? You don’t know. I will kill someone. You didn’t let her come home. God knows where my daughter 
must be wandering. Fehmida, even if she dies 
in a car accident and I find her dead body, I don’t care. I don’t care at all. And listen, also be concerned about the daughter 
you just married off. If her in-laws find out about 
the doings of this daughter, what will we tell them, 
have you thought about it? we all should die. She shamed us and went, she brought disgrace 
to all of us and left. I don’t know where my daughter must be wandering. Pray Fehmida, that she dies. We will only be able to get rid of 
this shame when she dies. Madam? Madam? The time of the park is over. Hey girl? Can’t you hear? Get up from here. What happened? The time of the park is over. Get out of here, go home. Look, we have orders to 
close the park in time, all the people left, only you are here, 
come on, go home. I, where will I go? I don’t even have a home, don’t let me out. Go wherever you want to go, but don’t waste my time, I have to go home as well. 
Come on, good girl. Brother, I will keep on sitting here, you lock the door and leave. I will keep on sitting here when 
people will come in the morning. Hey, girl, have you lost your mind? A lot of drug addicts jump through 
the park wall and come here, I will lose my job if I leave you here 
and something wrong happens with you. Come, get up from here, 
good girl, come. Come, come, come. 
Good girl. Good girl, get up. Get up, come on, come on, come on. Good girl. To be honest, sister Dua didn’t 
seem that kind of a girl to me. My sister is not like that, I am sure, I am sure someone trapped her. Did you find out? Is she back home or not? I don’t know, everyone must be so worried at home, that is why no one came. Obviously, everyone must be worried. What is it? Do you want to bring my sister to the same path by telling her 
the stories of your characterless sister? No, I was just… I don’t want to listen to anything, 
do you understand? Stay away from her. Brother, I and sister-in-law were just…
Quiet! What do we know about 
how she has been raised? It is better you stay away from her, 
there is no need to spend time with her. Come on, go away from here, come on. Brother, sister-in-law was just… 
I told you I didn’t want to listen to anything, just stay away from her. Come on. You shouldn’t have raised your finger
on my mother’s brought up. So, what else should I say? I should falsely praise her? Did you forget where she was caught? What are you saying? I sometimes don’t understand 
why I even interact with you, why do I even talk to you but listen to one thing very carefully, stay away from my sister, if you put any wrong thing in her mind, 
I will be the worst. I will kick you out of the house and
I won’t even think about Dad. Now get lost! Where are you going? Let us drop you. 
Come, come. What are you thinking? Come, come, 
where are you going? Wait, listen. Why are you getting scared? Come, we are good people. Come.
