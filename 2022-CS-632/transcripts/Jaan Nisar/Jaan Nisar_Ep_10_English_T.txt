[25.16] Come on, one by one, make a line.
[28.64] In a line, in a line.
[30.76] All of you, take off your shoes here,
[31.92] one by one.
[57.28] Dua, life is of no use without you.
[60.12] My family is forcing me to get married,
[62.88] I cannot wait any longer now,
[64.96] just meet me tomorrow,
[66.88] I will introduce you to Mom.
[68.48] I am letting you go because 
you are a noble man,
[70.84] it would have been difficult for me,
 had the FIR been filed.
[73.80] Take your daughter back.
[75.24] She is not my daughter.
[111.88] Amma Saeein has called you.
[118.40] Is everything well?
[120.12] Yes,
[121.84] Baba Saeein and Amma Saeein 
are going home
[124.52] so they are calling you.
[129.88] But how can I leave 
Nosherwan here and go?
[134.20] He will be alone here all night.
[140.72] Don’t worry about Saeein Jr,
[144.12] I will stay with him 
throughout the night.
[147.92] Jaffar how can you understand
 the responsibilities and duties of a wife?
[151.80] Jaffar is absolutely right,
[156.96] he is here to take care of me,
[163.00] you may go.
[164.72] But Nosherwan,
[167.12] how can I sleep peacefully
 leaving you here like this?
[171.24] Nothing has happened to me.
[175.08] I am fine now.
[181.88] You may go,
[185.48] Jaffar won’t leave from here.
[193.48] Don’t be late, Baba Saeein
[196.52] and Amma Saeein
 are waiting for you.
[201.88] Jaffar, take her away.
[204.00] Ok
[209.56] Nosherwan, I am leaving just 
because you are insisting so much,
[212.76] but I don’t feel like going.
[216.00] Take care of yourself,
[217.36] I will come back in the morning.
[221.96] Come, madam.
[326.80] I don’t know if they find out
 anything about Dua or not.
[331.56] Mom and Sania 
must be so worried,
[333.80] and Dad,
[335.76] he must be getting angry 
with both of them.
[341.60] Don’t let your in-laws get even 
a hint of what’s going on here.
[346.40] Do not even mistakenly say this.
[352.48] Why am I so helpless?
[354.68] I had to get married leaving 
everyone worried at home.
[369.16] Dad.
[375.84] Mr. Aslam, where is Dua?
[380.72] Dua is dead for us.
[384.88] But you went to get her,
[388.12] why didn’t you bring her along?
[389.40] You got a call, right?
[391.52] Yes, I went to see her,
[393.28] she is with characterless girls,
[394.76] she has been caught.
[407.68] Don’t test my patience, Mr. Aslam,
[411.28] tell me,
[412.64] for God’s sake tell me.
[415.68] How did she get to
 the police station?
[418.40] Fehmida, I am even 
embarrassed to tell you,
[422.48] I am even embarrassed to tell.
[430.60] No.
[432.16] Dua cannot be like that,
[434.92] she cannot be like that.
[439.60] Bring her, bring her,
[442.76] I will ask her myself
[444.76] as to why she did this.
[446.88] Don’t you dare take her name
 in this house again, Fehmida.
[450.32] She is dead for us.
[452.24] Don’t take her name 
in this house now,
[454.28] otherwise, I will bury 
everyone alive.
[461.48] We have no place for such 
a characterless girl in our house,
[465.60] there is no place.
[536.36] What happened?
[540.96] Why are you nervous?
[556.20] When I am with you,
[559.64] you never have to be nervous.
[569.68] Look at me.
[580.56] By the way, one thing 
came true for me,
[583.48] I was sure that
[586.56] my family would bring 
a modest girl for me,
[594.16] she wouldn’t even look at any man
[597.80] and that is exactly what happened.
[603.56] You look very beautiful
[607.68] and you have made 
a place in my heart in this attire.
[614.56] Oh yes,
[617.64] before I forget because 
of your beauty,
[622.48] I have brought something for you.
[640.76] It’s good, right?
[643.36] This is very beautiful.
[648.56] But not more than you.
[669.00] Your father is dead!
[670.96] After what I heard today,
[673.32] even if I had a daughter
[675.96] she would have died too.
[680.60] Hurry up,
[681.56] it will be a problem 
if someone sees us.
[683.80] Hey, no one will see.
[684.68] Don’t worry.
[687.84] Why are you closing the door?
[689.56] You do understand 
the meaning of surprise, right?
[691.20] Look, Mom will come,
[692.32] she will suddenly open the door and
[694.00] you will be sitting here,
[695.60] she will like it, right?
[697.20] I feel dizzy.
[699.20] Yes, yes, so you must rest.
[700.64] Lie down.
[702.04] Dua?
[705.04] Poor girl is in shock.
[708.16] Her lover must have left her,
[710.16] it will take time for her to recover.
[712.80] Hey?
[713.96] He is watching you cry,
[717.16] he will grant you justice.
[736.52] Dua?
[739.36] Dua?
[743.36] Sir, sir, are you fine?
[747.76] I have seen her falling 
from somewhere high.
[750.72] Who, sir?
[753.96] Dua.
[758.68] I am sure you had a dream, Sir.
[764.16] But Jaffar, what kind 
of a dream it was?
[768.40] And why did 
I have such a dream?
[772.92] Is she fine?
[774.44] Umm, everything is fine,
[777.48] I am sure she must be fine too.
[784.28] I need to know Dua’s wellbeing,
[785.52] call her,
[786.64] ask her how she is.
[787.68] Don’t worry about her, sir,
[790.60] I am telling you 
she is absolutely well.
[792.88] Do what I am telling you to do.
[795.12] Call her right now
[796.56] and ask her how she is
 and where she is.
[797.96] Sure.
[813.72] Sir, I have spoken to my guy,
[818.24] and he said that
[819.76] she is home and fine.
[828.68] Thank God.
[842.88] Enough, so much makeup 
has already been done.
[848.36] Look here.
[851.36] Very good.
[854.16] Look here.
[856.84] It will be overdone.
[858.08] No, no, it won’t look bad.
[859.76] It will look good only.
[862.12] Sister-in-law, you look very beautiful.
[864.24] Thank you.
[865.04] You have done such good makeup.
[866.76] Thank you.
[867.92] Your sister-in-law
[869.12] will obviously look beautiful 
because she is beautiful.
[871.20] Look, she looks so pretty.
[880.04] Oh, I forgot.
[882.44] Mom is calling you.
[883.96] Sister-in-law,
[884.44] I will go check what mom
 is saying and come back,
[885.36] okay?
[898.96] I couldn’t say this to 
you in front of Sumbul,
[907.88] but I don’t know why,
[910.72] I start losing my senses
 as soon I look at you.
[919.28] I don’t know
[921.16] why I feel like
[924.08] you have cast a spell on me,
[927.72] is that so?
[945.88] I feel I am lucky that
[951.48] your hand is in my hand.
[956.32] Me too.
[959.56] And it will always be.
[980.16] I have received a call from the M.P.
[981.96] he can come here at any time,
[983.72] that’s why we have to let them go.
[985.36] I am giving you all a last
 warning and letting you go,
[988.24] but if I catch you next time,
[990.28] I won’t let you go,
[991.48] did you hear me?
[998.60] All of you, stand in a line.
[1000.00] Take them.
[1001.60] Go out.
[1002.56] Come on, make a line,
[1003.92] make a line, stand in a line.
[1006.80] Go, you people go as well.
[1008.32] Hurry up, come on.
[1028.92] Come.
[1029.44] Hey, you are walking.
[1032.48] That’s great,
[1034.52] but you really need to rest for now.
[1039.12] No doctor,
[1040.48] I would like to go home.
[1042.64] There is a strange restlessness here.
[1045.12] It’s because of the medicine.
[1046.48] Fogginess happens.
[1048.12] For now, I won’t advise you to go,
[1051.92] I need you for a couple of days.
[1053.80] Just one to two days, at least.
[1059.36] Okay, Doctor.
[1063.80] Thank you, Sir.
[1064.64] Thank you so much.
[1069.84] Nosherwan,
[1071.68] you have to stay here for 2 to 3 
days like the doctor said
[1077.96] because I cannot bear 
grief at this age anymore.
[1085.12] Baba Saieen, men
[1087.52] do not get scared by 
these minor wounds,
[1092.68] I am perfectly all right now.
[1097.96] Stay blessed,
[1099.56] my lion-like son.
[1155.80] The apartment that your daughter 
got arrested from, there…
[1161.00] Tell me something,
[1162.04] are you acting unaware
[1164.88] or you already know all this before?
[1201.04] Mom?
[1204.60] Mom?
[1207.12] Dad?
[1209.60] Dad?
[1211.40] Dad? Dad.
[1212.44] My Dua.
[1213.92] Hey?
[1214.64] Mr. Aslam.
[1215.44] Wait.
[1216.08] Mr. Aslam.
[1218.88] Dad, open the door.
[1220.52] Leave my hand.
[1221.60] Leave me.
[1222.48] Let me open the door.
[1223.72] Let me open the door.
[1226.16] Let me open the door.
[1227.56] Dad?
[1228.56] Dad, open the door.
[1230.64] Dad, Dad, it’s me, Dua.
[1234.64] Dad,
[1236.24] Dad,
[1237.28] open the door,
[1240.12] Mom?
[1241.80] If you take one more 
step across this door,
[1244.36] I will bury you alive.
[1246.68] I made a huge mistake,
[1248.32] Dad, I made a mistake.
[1250.48] I made a huge mistake,
[1252.68] forgive me,
[1253.56] Let me come inside once,
[1254.72] I will tell you everything.
[1255.88] For God’s sake, let her come in.
[1257.88] Get out of here.
[1258.72] Dad, let me come in, I will tell you,
[1260.48] Mom, it wasn’t my fault.
[1261.28] Enough is enough,
[1262.52] there is no place for a characterless 
girl like you in this house.
[1265.68] We can sit inside and talk about 
whatever needs to be said.
[1267.20] Dad, please, Dad, listen to me.
[1268.52] No, move, move back.
[1269.20] I am asking you to move back.
[1270.12] Move back.
[1271.04] Dad, for God’s sake.
[1272.08] Move back.
[1273.12] I am asking you to move back.
[1275.08] Dad, listen to me, please Dad.
[1276.28] I am telling you to move back.
[1280.00] Dad, listen to me, Dad.
[1283.72] Dad?
[1285.64] Get lost.
[1286.92] You guys come inside.
[1288.28] Dad
[1289.96] Mr. Aslam, my heart will explode.
[1291.72] For God’s sake, I beg you.
[1293.60] I beg you, let her come in.
[1295.40] Dad? Have mercy, Dad.
[1297.96] Dad?
[1299.16] Mr. Aslam, let her come in.
[1301.44] Let her come in. For God’s sake.
[1303.64] Fehmida,
[1306.00] don’t talk much,
[1308.08] if you talk about this girl,
[1309.96] I will divorce you.
[1363.92] Brother, tea.
[1366.64] Sister-in-law,
[1367.40] how many spoons of sugar?
[1368.20] Just half a teaspoon.
[1370.52] Shall I add a whole teaspoon?
[1371.68] Okay.
[1374.32] Give it to me, I'll make it myself.
[1378.08] Thank you.
[1379.20] Make it for Mom as well.
[1381.80] It’s almost afternoon,
[1384.48] but the daughter-in-law’s family 
hasn’t come with breakfast yet.
[1392.92] Hey, there must be some problem,
[1394.72] what’s the big deal?
[1396.32] Get breakfast made at home,
[1398.08] we do have everything to eat 
at home by the grace of God.
[1401.08] Breakfast will be made anyhow,
[1403.60] and I am not dying
 to have breakfast
[1405.16] from the daughter-in-law’s house,
[1412.32] but there are things called
 rituals and traditions,
[1418.64] though the daughter-in-law’s family
[1421.04] was telling that 
they follow traditions and rituals.
[1423.80] There is no need to make
 a big deal of such a small issue.
[1428.68] Go check the kitchen
[1430.04] and arrange something
 for breakfast.
[1434.40] My child, what will you have?
[1438.68] Nothing special, uncle.
[1441.20] Thanks a million times to God
[1443.32] that we didn’t take 
a curse like dowry
[1446.60] but now I feel we are 
not even getting breakfast.
[1451.12] At least,
[1452.32] they should have brought breakfast,
[1453.92] if they couldn’t bring it themselves,
[1456.36] they could have sent 
it through someone.
[1460.44] Umm, Mom, I will go in the kitchen.
[1467.84] I will make breakfast.
[1469.92] I have to make breakfast even today,
[1472.88] wow.
[1476.92] Breakfast?
[1477.92] I don’t know if they would
 even be in their senses.
[1480.92] I don’t know what my family 
must be going through.
[1487.40] Mom, open the door.
[1490.08] Where will I go, Mom?
[1494.20] Dad, open the door.
[1501.64] Don’t leave me alone like this.
[1506.56] I am your daughter.
[1513.12] Mom, your Dua.
[1518.20] I am your Dua.
[1523.40] I am your Dua.
[1594.20] Do feed him the soup.
[1596.52] I have brought food
 for him from home.
[1599.44] Try to give him this for now,
[1601.20] keep him on liquid for now.
[1603.64] Oh okay.
[1606.72] You are his?
[1608.00] I am his wife.
[1609.48] Okay.
[1612.76] Okay, you need to give
 him medicine after lunch.
[1614.76] Hmm.
[1615.16] And a tablet from this.
[1616.84] Okay.
[1618.52] Thank you.
[1621.52] You are troubling yourself 
for no reason,
[1626.36] go home, Jaffar is here with me,
[1629.52] children must be missing you,
 they will get worried.
[1632.32] I will eat it myself.
[1634.00] Jaffar is not your wife, Nosherwan,
[1637.16] I will feed you.
[1646.24] Very good
[1659.12] What?
[1662.88] No, no, sister,
[1664.12] I am sure you had 
a misunderstanding.
[1668.48] No.
[1672.88] What?
[1676.72] Hmm,
[1678.92] that is why so much drama 
was being done there.
[1684.44] Okay, thank you, sister,
[1685.80] I will talk to you later.
[1688.04] Yes, yes.
[1689.48] Bye. Mr.
[1692.04] Nazeer?
[1693.68] Okay, I will ask and let you know.
[1696.20] Okay my child,
[1696.76] let me ask and let you know.
[1698.48] Okay, bye, bye.
[1702.56] Kids are missing you a lot,
[1704.88] they were asking if they could
 come to meet you here.
[1707.44] No, it wouldn’t be right
 to call them here.
[1711.72] I will go to meet them very soon.
[1717.08] I wish you would love me as much
[1721.32] as you love the kids.
[1726.76] Do you get jealous of the kids too?
[1729.28] I am not getting jealous,
[1731.60] I am just being envious of their luck.
[1739.68] Where were you, Jaffar?
[1741.32] I was just here, outside.
[1744.00] Where is my phone?
[1745.04] it is with me.
[1747.24] Give it to me, I need to make a call.
[1748.44] okay…
[1748.96] Mmhmm,
[1751.12] not at all,
[1753.00] don’t give it to him.
[1755.00] Are you in your senses?
[1759.16] I am in my senses,
[1761.08] that is why I am saying that
[1763.04] it’s good if you stay away
 from all the stresses.
[1769.60] I know better what’s good 
and what’s bad for me.
[1776.40] Jaffar?
[1777.44] Yes sir?
[1778.84] Take madam home, she needs rest.
[1782.84] Nosherwan, I…
[1783.96] Jaffar?
[1791.12] Let’s go, Madam.
[1794.60] Jaffar?
[1796.56] Yes, Sir?
[1798.80] Phone.
[1801.08] Sorry, Sir.
[1830.00] I will go home and
[1831.20] then I will come back
[1832.00] in two hours to pick you.
[1832.84] Are you mad?
[1834.72] Home is just two streets away,
[1836.20] I will go with a kid.
[1839.16] Now look,
[1841.20] it’s better for me to go help
 Mom instead of sitting here.
[1845.56] You know
[1846.40] how Dad makes her nervous.
[1851.20] Wow, madam, wow,
[1853.76] you are sitting here so peacefully
 after ruining the peace of our life,
[1859.48] how do you act so well?
[1861.72] Why are you proving
 to be an illiterate?
[1864.72] What happened?
[1865.92] What was your mother saying?
[1867.92] That my daughter had 
food poisoning,
[1870.28] she had food poisoning
[1871.64] or did she run away 
with someone?
[1878.24] They kept on saying 
throughout the wedding
[1880.64] that my daughter was not well,
[1883.16] she wasn’t unwell,
[1884.56] she left with someone,
[1886.16] she ran away.
[1887.32] Oh God,
[1889.00] we have gotten into
 what kind of a family,
[1891.32] our fate has been destroyed,
[1893.04] a girl from what kind of a family 
has come into our house.
[1895.00] Hey, what are you saying?
[1896.88] And who told you this?
[1898.88] What am I saying?
[1900.32] That girl has been caught
 at the police station.
[1910.24] Thank God that 
an acquaintance called me,
[1913.04] she used to live near their area,
[1915.12] this matter has spread, 
not just in the entire neighborhood,
[1916.76] but the entire city.
[1922.32] Dua is not like that.
[1927.20] Dua?
[1931.44] Yes, yes, Dua, her sister.
[1936.76] No, do you know,
[1938.12] my sister is not like that,
[1939.76] she cannot do this. Do you know,
[1941.80] I am sure something
 happened to her,
[1944.12] someone trapped
 her in this trouble.
[1945.32] No one even came to ask us
[1947.52] or welcome us, yeah?
[1949.92] And they kept on lying to us?
[1952.20] That the daughter is unwell.
[1954.04] Wow, wow.
[1961.60] Tomorrow?
[1963.08] It is the wedding day tomorrow.
[1965.20] Faraz,
[1966.60] I am getting very late,
[1969.00] I have to be home before 
the groom and family.
[1974.68] They didn’t know anything as well,
[1976.16] what could we do?
[1978.56] Dua? Is everything okay?
[1979.84] I feel dizzy.
[1981.72] What is Fiza’s fault in 
whatever happened?
[1985.12] You are yelling 
at her for no reason.
[1986.84] I am yelling because
[1988.68] when people find 
out about our family,
[1991.08] what will you tell them?
[1992.60] This is what the sister of 
our daughter-in-law does.
[1995.80] No, no,
[1997.08] Dua is not like this,
[1998.76] I am telling you,
[2000.00] she cannot do this,
[2001.52] I know something has
 definitely happened to her.
[2010.68] Hey, we understand all 
your dramas very well.
[2013.64] Sarfaraz?
[2019.40] Hello?
[2020.24] Hello? Faraz?
[2022.88] Yes, what is it?
[2024.00] Where are you?
[2026.64] What do you mean by where I am?
[2027.64] I am at home.
[2030.28] No, I mean, is Dua with you?
[2036.84] Why would Dua be with me?
[2039.72] I am trying your 
phone since yesterday,
[2041.44] but your phone was switched off.
[2043.52] Yes, my phone’s
 battery died yesterday,
[2047.24] but why are you asking about Dua?
[2051.24] Where did Dua go 
if she is not with you?
[2056.04] Rida, tell me clearly,
[2057.72] what are you trying to say?
[2059.52] Look,
[2061.40] I went to Dua’s home for her
 sister’s wedding yesterday,
[2065.04] I think Dua has eloped
[2068.68] and I thought she would be with you.
[2071.20] Do you know,
[2072.60] her father was so angry,
[2075.00] he was investigating me,
[2076.76] he was asking me to
[2077.92] tell him who is his daughter 
having an affair with.
