[24.16] Okay, Fiza, child, tell me.
[36.80] Tell me, what is your will?
[38.88] Tell us whatever your will is.
[40.96] Tell us.
[45.08] Now, what difference will my will make?
[48.48] As much bad had to happen to me,
[51.04] it has happened.
[54.32] My child, what had to 
happen has happened.
[63.20] Now, look, listen to me,
[64.96] we will accept the decision you make.
[72.76] If you want to live with Sarfaraz…
[75.08] then live with him.
[83.56] If you want to make any other decision…
[84.68] make whatever decision you want,
I will do whatever you say.
[86.92] Tell me.
[90.68] I want a divorce from Sarfaraz.
[119.52] What point has life brought us to?
[128.80] We cannot even stop you 
from making this decision.
[138.28] Maybe, this is better for you.
[149.32] I don’t want to become a sinner
by stopping you further.
[159.36] Okay. Okay,
[162.96] child, you have made your decision,
[166.84] so I will hire a good lawyer.
[176.60] Don’t worry.
[178.12] Come on.
[181.24] We are with you, child.
[183.76] Don’t be scared.
[186.76] Thank you, Papa.
[194.92] Forgive me.
[197.64] Forgive me.
[214.20] Okay,
[216.88] so you want to remove 
Dua out of the way
[220.24] because you want to get Ghaznavi.
[222.56] You too want to get Dua.
[229.84] And not just Dua,
[232.40] but also all the wealth.
[235.44] Yes, that’s how it is,
[237.56] and when you know 
everything about me,
[239.92] then why are you asking?
[242.04] When the interests are the same,
[244.60] you must keep information 
about each other.
[248.84] Tell me,
[250.44] do you accept this deal?
[262.92] What will the percentage be?
[267.92] Whatever is in Dua’s share will be yours.
[285.12] You didn’t leave any room for refusal.
[335.32] Hey, Mr. Naseer, what happened?
[337.40] What is written in it? Tell me.
[340.20] This…
[344.04] Sarfaraz.
[345.44] Sarfaraz.
[346.48] Tell me, what is written?
[350.32] -What happened?
-Sarfaraz, see,
[351.88] your Papa is getting unwell.
God knows what is written in it.
[358.24] Okay.
[360.80] So, now they have the courage that 
they will send me a notice for separation?
[367.84] What do you mean?
[370.56] Fiza wants to separate from me.
[379.36] Oh God.
[382.32] They are such shameless people.
[393.88] They have no modesty in them. 
Those people are so cheap.
[402.96] First, they tried to trap my son with 
one daughter and ruin his reputation,
[407.52] and then they deceitfully arranged 
his marriage with the other.
[417.36] No,
[418.68] you make them pay.
[420.52] You give them an answer.
[421.92] You divorce her. 
Only then will they understand.
[428.12] Hey, have shame.
[429.92] Hey, you have some shame.
[435.88] It is all your son’s doing.
[445.80] He is their sinner.
[448.28] He is a sinner.
[453.36] This is their decency that 
they secretly sent a notice for divorce,
[461.88] or else by principle, 
they should have sent the police.
[465.40] The police.
[470.08] You only see my son to be bad,
[473.28] everyone else is clean.
[478.64] Have some shame Kausar. 
Have some shame.
[481.76] We too have a daughter.
[488.12] She is married.
[490.72] If in the future Khizar divorces her,
[495.00] what will we go through?
Have you thought about it?
[497.32] Look. Look, 
I am telling you
[499.52] not to compare my daughter 
to those girls.
[502.88] My daughter is not immodest 
like those girls.
[506.72] Stop arguing with each other, first.
[509.40] We will stop arguing,
[511.36] but tell me, what do we do
about this damned notice?
[519.40] You will visit the court?
[521.76] Who will pay the fees of the lawyer?
[527.96] Yes, so why do we need to be worried?
[530.96] They have sent me a notice
of separation, right?
[534.32] I will go deal with them.
[535.76] Hey. Hey. Stop him.
[538.36] Kausar, stop him.
[539.72] Sarfaraz.
[541.08] What if he goes and does 
something wrong there?
[545.08] I will bring water for you. 
Get a grip on yourself.
[549.88] There is always some trouble 
that comes along.
[552.08] Oh, where will I go with this condition?
[562.48] Fiza, child,
[564.84] think about it.
[566.08] I have sent the notice,
[568.08] but still you have time.
Think about it.
[572.60] Papa,
[575.12] I have made this decision 
after thinking hard.
[582.92] I had never even thought that 
we would have to see this day too.
[593.36] Does anyone even think about 
such things, Fehmida?
[595.24] They just happen. Yes.
[598.84] Who is here, now? 
I will see.
[600.64] Papa, you sit.
I will check.
[612.72] Greetings.
[614.96] Fiza.
[621.00] Fiza.
[628.44] What do you think?
[630.32] You will send me a notice and
I will come here to apologize to you.
[633.48] I will fall at your feet?
[638.00] Here is your notice.
[649.04] And you did well that 
you sent me this notice.
[661.56] Because the truth is that 
I never wanted to marry you.
[673.00] I love you.
[679.68] Hey!
[687.92] Yes, Dua, I love you even today.
[693.44] Stop your nonsense.
[696.36] This is not nonsense, 
this is the truth.
[706.44] I love you just the same way 
you loved me, with all your heart.
[721.12] I even remember today how 
you used to secretly meet me.
[724.60] I have not forgotten anything.
[730.16] I have not forgotten anything. 
Hey,
[732.40] you haven’t stopped with your indecency.
[734.28] Won’t you stay quiet?
Get lost.
[742.72] And say whatever you want 
to say through your lawyer.
[745.40] Get lost from here.
[746.96] What is the need of a lawyer and judge,
[749.48] when we have to make the decision 
ourselves, over here?
[759.76] I have made my decision.
[769.88] Dua, the way you are my first love, 
I know….
[773.96] Hey!
[774.84] I am your first love.
[783.28] And I am ready to do anything 
to make you mine.
[794.60] For that,
[796.92] even if I have to leave your sister,
then I will.
[799.96] Hey!
[808.68] That’s why, today, to make you mine,
[814.72] I divorce her.
[831.32] Get out.
[834.08] I divorce you.
[844.80] I divorce you.
[850.24] Get lost from here. 
Get out.
[852.72] Dua, I divorced your sister for you, today.
[897.68] Fiza.
[899.24] Fiza.
[901.68] Fiza.
[924.04] Hey, what have you been up to?
[929.56] I have ended everything.
[933.92] What have you done?
[938.92] I divorced her.
[940.68] What?
[942.24] Hey, you will never be happy.
[944.88] You will never be happy.
[946.88] Hey, you treated such 
a good girl so badly.
[951.04] You were unjust to her.
[953.40] You will never find peace in your life.
[956.60] You will never find peace.
You will never find it.
[961.16] Are you his father or his enemy?
[964.12] You are cursing your son.
[967.16] He has not joked around and come.
[970.24] He divorced her and came.
[972.32] Have you ever thought
[973.72] what my son’s heart would 
have gone through?
[976.84] He is truly cursed.
Truly cursed.
[980.48] Just think about what that poor girl 
must have gone through.
[984.16] What her parents must be 
going through?
[987.24] He will never find happiness.
[990.48] I curse him!
[992.72] With the way he's acting, 
may God never accept anything from him.
[1032.80] Fiza.
[1033.76] Fiza, my child. 
Get a grip on yourself.
[1037.32] Fiza, child.
[1039.76] Hey, you, yourself, 
wanted to get a divorce,
[1042.12] then why are you crying so badly, child?
[1050.84] End this discussion here.
[1053.04] Yes, I wanted a divorce.
[1055.72] But today,
[1057.84] Papa, he divorced me in front 
of everyone and left.
[1061.84] It is all over.
[1071.20] He used to threaten me all the time 
but he had never dared to do it.
[1074.00] But today, he stood in your home
[1076.84] and ended everything. 
Why?
[1083.84] Did you people not see,
[1086.44] how he was openly declaring 
his love for Dua?
[1100.56] So, what did she do that today 
his love was talking so highly of her?
[1104.44] Something has happened, right?
[1118.44] From the night of the wedding until today,
[1122.04] that man has given me 
so much sorrow,
[1127.12] so much pain, that even 
my soul has been wounded.
[1139.80] And today, I found out the reason 
for my destruction was no one else,
[1143.24] but my own sister.
[1172.12] Move back.
[1174.96] Do you understand? 
Leave me.
[1209.48] She is angry, child.
[1211.60] What happened to her is bad. 
Don’t mind.
[1230.08] What?
Who were you talking to?
[1232.68] Who would I talk to alone 
in the room?
[1235.04] The clothes had become wet,
I thought I would change.
[1237.76] Dua, I heard with my ears 
you were talking to someone.
[1240.68] Me… 
I was not talking to anyone.
[1243.60] I was dancing so 
I was singing along with it.
[1245.64] I locked the door, 
had Mama and Papa seen me,
[1247.72] they would have scolded me, right?
[1253.96] What will I do sitting here?
[1255.56] I will do one thing, 
I will go back
[1257.76] and then I will come back 
after two hours and take you.
[1259.68] Where are you going? 
Are you mad?
[1262.92] You know,
[1264.04] if you go home alone right now,
then Papa will get really angry.
[1266.40] I had such a hard time getting permission
to come to the parlor in the first place.
[1270.32] Come on, just stay a little longer.
[1271.80] Why do you need to go?
[1273.76] Hey, our home is two streets away.
[1275.44] I will go with some child, man.
[1278.48] Now, see,
[1280.48] it is better I go home and help Mama,
instead of sitting here.
[1284.76] You know how Papa worries her.
[1293.24] You have a sister, 
whose name is Dua
[1296.28] and you are aware of her actions.
[1298.92] She used to secretly 
talk to boys on the phone.
[1301.28] Did you see the result of that? 
She ran away.
[1304.16] No, Dua was not like that.
[1306.00] Just once. 
Let me meet her once,
[1307.72] -I will ask her myself why she…
-Don’t you dare, Fiza.
[1310.76] You don’t even think about 
meeting her, understand?
[1313.96] If you try to talk to her, then
I will divorce you on the spot.
[1320.08] Because the truth is that 
I never wanted to marry you.
[1322.84] Yes, Dua, I love you even today.
[1326.00] I love you just the same way 
you loved me, with all your heart.
[1329.36] I even remember today 
how you used to secretly meet me.
[1332.32] I have not forgotten anything.
[1333.44] I am ready to do anything 
to make you mine.
[1335.56] For that, even if I have 
to leave your sister, then I will.
[1338.80] That’s why, today, to make you mine,
I divorce her.
[1357.76] Fiza.
[1364.20] Fiza, why are you upset with me?
[1366.52] There is no reality in whatever 
Sarfaraz said and went.
[1379.64] All that was my stupidity.
[1385.44] You did something stupid so easily.
[1392.48] You sinned, then 
why am I getting punished?
[1402.08] I never looked for secret doors like you.
[1410.64] I never used to go 
and meet someone, secretly.
[1417.12] I am really extremely embarrassed.
[1422.96] But,
[1424.28] I swear, I had never thought that 
you would get punished for my sin.
[1428.56] You didn’t think about it?
[1430.08] You didn’t think about it, right?
[1431.52] But today, you’ve seen it all 
with your own eyes, haven’t you?
[1434.68] Are your yearnings finally fulfilled?
[1441.96] My loyalty,
[1444.56] my love,
[1446.80] my care,
[1448.84] even my child,
[1454.04] couldn’t stop Sarfaraz from divorcing me.
[1457.60] Because he wants to be with you.
[1465.72] He loves you and,
[1468.52] you too love him.
[1471.08] You are that girl, right? Huh?
[1473.64] You are that girl who went on 
my wedding night to meet Sarfaraz.
[1480.80] Speak up!
[1481.96] You are that girl, right?
[1488.24] Yes. Yes.
[1491.80] I am that girl.
[1498.32] Fiza, I swear, I am so sorry.
I am that girl,
[1501.72] but whatever he said and 
went has no truth in it.
[1504.88] Whatever he said was a lie.
[1507.28] There is nothing like that.
[1509.56] What will you suffer?
[1511.08] You have put the punishment 
in my share.
[1514.12] Huh?
[1518.72] Listen to me once.
[1521.44] You will understand everything.
 You will know everything.
[1524.28] Hear me out once…
[1525.68] I am not in the position to think 
or understand anything right now,
[1529.08] okay?
[1530.08] Not for me but leave for 
my child’s sake right now, please.
[1533.64] Leave. Please.
[1535.08] You… you are my sister,
[1537.76] and seeing you like this 
is causing me so much pain.
[1539.84] Please talk to me. 
Tell me what’s going on.
[1543.40] I’m right here. I’m with you. 
I’ll listen to everything you have to say.
[1546.00] I don’t want to talk to you 
about anything.
[1551.12] You are the one.
[1552.28] The pain in my heart 
increases seeing you.
[1554.40] Leave from here.
[1558.52] Why can you not go? 
Don’t you understand?
[1566.68] Don’t you understand? 
For God’s sake, leave.
[1570.68] What are you listening to?
Leave. Leave.
[1599.52] This had to happen.
[1602.76] I already had an idea that 
Sarfaraz could do something like this.
[1609.12] I don’t know.
[1611.88] But, I cannot see this condition of Fiza.
[1622.20] I feel that I am responsible for all this.
[1632.00] All this is happening with Fiza 
because of my stupidity.
[1636.60] Dwelling in the past and blaming
yourself won’t do anything.
[1640.92] You have not done anything.
[1647.60] If Sarfaraz had even a little place 
for Fiza in his heart,
[1651.88] then he would have never divorced her.
[1659.64] He didn’t divorce her because of you.
[1666.72] He is an indifferent person.
[1669.92] He did this helplessly 
at the hands of his nature.
[1673.40] But,
[1674.84] along with divorcing Fiza,
[1680.08] he has said really bad things to me.
[1688.76] He portrayed in front of everyone that
[1691.68] he was divorcing Fiza because of me.
[1699.36] That he loves me even today.
[1709.48] Although, there is nothing 
like that between us.
[1728.80] Don’t even dare mention Dua’s name
on your lips, I’m warning you.
[1731.08] Not just the name,
[1733.92] everything about her 
is at my fingertips.
[1736.52] Anyway,
[1739.08] look, you came into her life right now,
[1742.72] and fine,
[1744.08] you impressed her with your money, but,
[1747.76] I had nothing.
[1750.00] Despite that,
[1753.48] my name was on her lips.
[1775.32] You?
[1777.48] What are you doing here?
[1780.28] I came to meet you.
[1783.40] Why?
[1785.36] The relationship we had with 
regard to Fiza has ended.
[1790.60] Yes, that relationship is over,
[1793.32] but I only ended that relationship,
[1796.32] so that I can form a 
new relationship with you.
[1798.88] What is the meaning of this nonsense?
[1801.84] The meaning is clear, it’s obvious,
[1805.08] that what I said yesterday is 
the same thing I’m saying today,
[1807.84] that I love you,
[1814.16] and I want to marry you.
[1816.72] and if I married Fiza,
[1818.52] then it was only because
I had pressure on me from people.
[1829.12] I got scared that day,
I got misguided.
[1835.04] But, I swear, I never wanted 
to cause you harm.
[1848.20] If I even divorced Fiza,
it is because of you.
[1862.16] and I want you to 
come back into my life.
[1866.24] -If I divorced Fiza…
-Enough!
[1872.36] If you say another word, 
I will break your face.
[1878.28] Guards.
[1879.56] Whatever I did, I did for you.
[1881.84] -Dua, listen to me. 
-Take him away.
[1883.64] Dua, look, this is not right.
I cannot live without you.
[1887.08] Whatever I did was for you.
Don’t do this.
[1889.88] Don’t take me out of your life.
I will face a big loss.
[1892.60] Dua, listen to me…
[1914.64] Wow,
[1915.92] great performance, Sarfaraz.
[1921.80] Now, no one can stop the watchman
and guard from testifying in front of Ghaznavi.
[1974.76] My loyalty,
[1976.36] my love,
[1978.04] my care, even my child,
[1981.20] couldn’t stop Sarfaraz
from divorcing me.
[1984.68] Because he wants to be with you.
[1987.76] He loves you and, you too love him.
