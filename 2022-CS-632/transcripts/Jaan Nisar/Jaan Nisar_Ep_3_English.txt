Water. Keep it. Did you make her understand? I haven’t spoken to Dua, yet. But don’t worry,
 I will make her understand. Make her understand, 
she is my daughter, not anyone else’s. Yes. Yes. And understand one more thing, these unveiled women
 wandering around. Hell-bound. They are hell-bound. My daughters, who haven't even 
reached adulthood yet, I have already made 
them wear burqas. My daughters are much better 
off than these hell-bound women. You should not say things like 
these about anyone’s daughters. Why? Why don’t you say it? Hey, these women, who roam around in the markets, they are hell-bound. And hear one more thing, they will take the hell 
fire with them like fuel. Will eat something? Should I make tea? Yes. Did Bakshi send anything? No. That damned man is a miser. I will go make tea. Why? Why would you make it? Ask your daughters. And listen, massage my head. I have a bad headache. I will tell them to make tea. Yes, tell them. Dua. Yes? Did you eat something? Yes, I ate. By the way, sister, you too should
 have come with us. Honestly, it was much fun. I popped so many balloons. Leave it. it is good that she didn’t go, or else she too would have had to listen to Papa scolding 
her on a foreigner’s invitation. It is like getting scolded
 by Papa is her fate. How did the boys look? What is the matter? Let me ask. Tell me. How were they? Were both of them handsome or was just one of them handsome? I don’t know. I didn’t see. Meaning, you got scolded for no reason. You have started to speak a lot. I feel I have to pull your ears a lot. No, no, she only shuts up when she is in front of Papa. It feels as though her 
blood is going to run dry. Yes, right? She only talks when
 she has to work. Dua. Yes? You know, Kiran. Even her mother had come
 to Mr. Bakhshi’s home. You know, 
she is going to get married. Who Kiran? Hey, Aunt Rehmana’s daughter. Yes. Yes. Yes. She used to be small, she is going to get married. Welcome, sir. Welcome, sir. Sir, we are very lucky that you came personally to give 
a donation to our university. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Come on. Come on. Please, sir. Thank you very much. Thanks to people like you… Thank you very much, sir. You came here and
 really honored us. You really care for our university. Keep this, please. May God… Thank you very much, sir. Sir, are you looking for someone? Huh? Are you looking for someone? No, I will just leave. Your younger master is coming to 
the mansion after a long time. Make sure he doesn’t 
dislike anything. And did you make all
 the dishes he likes, right? Yes, Amma Saeein. You did well. And you people also be careful. Now, he comes after days, he shouldn’t get
 a chance to complain. Okay? Yes, madam Saeen, younger master is here. Come on. Come on. How are you? Absolutely fine, 
now that you are here. Where is Baba Saeein? Inside. Come. He is waiting for you. Come. Come on. You have started to 
make us wait a lot. Don’t you feel like 
meeting your mother? Why won’t I feel like it? Then why do you visit after so long? My eyes long to see you. After all, after Zawar, this mansion has 
become really deserted, and you too have 
increased the distances. Mama, there are no distances. Karachi is not far. You come over whenever you want to. Okay, I will visit often now. every time promise that 
you will come soon, and then you forget 
after you leave. Okay, you please don’t cry. I promise that I will come sooner now. The son has come after so long and you have started your
 complaints and grievances. Please serve him. I got everything he likes cooked. Should I have food served? No, not right now. Let me go meet the children. Okay. Go. Yes, so how are you two? I am really good. You know, he is really bad. She is the bad one, uncle. She is always 
falsely praising herself. No. No. No. Don’t fight. You don’t talk like this. Tell me, how are studies
 going for both of you? Really good. Yes? Yes. And how did you like these gifts? Really good. Greetings. Greetings. All okay? Why are you standing
 outside like this? I was waiting for a child. Actually, I had to get the bill paid. Give it to me, I will do it. Hey, no, no, you will be bothered. Some child will get it done. Hey, what is the botheration in this? A person does this much for neighbors. I went to get the bill paid during the day, there was so much rush there, I came back. I thought I would get it 
paid through a child. You give it to me, I will deposit it. I hope I am not bothering you. No big deal. I will just
 go and come back. How is the planning 
for your factory going? Yes, I have just given 
the blueprint to be made. As soon as it arrives, the work will begin. Hmmm. These things shouldn’t be delayed. Tea. Thank you. By the way, you won the hearts of people 
announcing the factory. We won't have to work hard for
 the votes in the next elections. No Baba Saeein, I am not doing all this to win the votes. I really want to do 
something for my people. Hmmm. This is a good thing. Not just a factory, I plan on making a college 
and university too. Where my own people 
can get educated. Hun.. Then just think that you've solidified the political future 
for the next seven generations of ours. A little while back you were telling me that the son has come after so long, what are you talking about? And now you are just
 talking about politics. Hey, you talk about things you like. When is there a restriction on you? Nosherwan. Yes? Son, you are alone there, you take care of yourself, right? Nosherwan. Yes? Where did you get lost? I…no, nothing. Just like that. Madam, try that younger master 
doesn’t go back this time. The girls of Karachi are really smart, if someone gets a hold of him, then you will be in a tough spot. Did you pay the bill? It got paid. Here is your bill and the remaining amount. Thank you very much. I can do this much for you, it is our responsibility. We are neighbors and let me tell you, neighbors are closer 
than your own blood. Yes. Yes. Now, we live next door, it would be better to share
 both joys and sorrows, right? Okay, I will go now. Yes. One more thing. What? Please keep the door closed, it is a matter of privacy. Tomorrow? So soon? Why? Do you have an 
issue with tomorrow? Hey, I have no issues. How will we make
 preparations so soon? Then, I still haven’t 
spoken to Mr. Aslam. So, I am sitting here, I will talk to Mr. Aslam. They are really good people, very religious. And I like the family so much, that don’t ask. They made the desire to see, Fiza, so I gave them time for tomorrow. I will go and check. Greetings. Greetings. How are you, Mr. Aslam? Thank God. Fix your scarf. Oh, it is a still scarf, it doesn’t stay on the head at all. Now tell me, why did you come? I came for Fiza’s proposal. They are good people, so I have asked them 
to come tomorrow. Really? Tomorrow? Isn’t it too soon? Now you too don’t think
 about haste like your wife. Look, Mr. Aslam, good proposals don’t wait for anyone. Yes, that is true. Bua, you know, we have no demands. They can make demands from us. We just need a decent boy. Just a decent boy, who is religious, he follows the religion. If he has a little money, if he has a business, 
then even that will be fine. Hey, you don’t worry about this at all. They are really simple people. Fine, then. Go ahead. Okay, then, make arrangements for tea tomorrow. Yes, we will. Don’t worry. Okay, Fehmida, we will meet tomorrow. I will go now. I have to go somewhere else too. Okay. Okay, this means that the groom’s family is 
coming to see the bride. Hmmm Do you know, mama? Uncle got a lot of toys for us. Really? Then you people must 
be enjoying it a lot. A lot. Okay listen, when uncle has brought 
you such good gifts, then you too don’t have 
to bother him in return, okay? He is never bothered by us. Yes, mama, uncle is always happy with us. Really? Son, you are alone there, you take care of yourself, right? Nosherwan. Yes? Where did you get lost? I…no, nothing. Just like that. Children, you have to go to school, right? Yes? So, don’t you have to sleep? Okay, mama. Goodnight. Goodnight. Bye. Well done. Goodnight. I will come and check. Sleep quickly. Okay. Okay. Try that younger master 
doesn’t go back this time. The girls of Karachi are really smart, if someone gets a hold of him, then you will be in a tough spot. You are just sitting down to study? Don’t turn on the light or else I won't be able to wake 
up for the late-night prayers. Beloved Dua, Since I've laid eyes on you, I've lost track of day and night. Lost in your thoughts all the time, it's as if I've disconnected from the world and only your presence lingers. I long to gaze upon your face. I don't know what you think of me, but after meeting you, I'm incapable of thinking of anything else. I've fallen in love with you. I've fallen deeply in love with you. Who is it? Huh? Who is it? Oh, get lost from here. Uh-huh. This time, you visited after a long time. I was busy. You got something for everyone, didn’t you bring anything for me? You have everything. When do I have everything, Nosherwan? Even after having so much, I feel that my hands are empty. Everyone really misses you here. Yes, I know. Don’t you miss me? I never stop missing. Take out the car. Brother. Brother, nothing will happen to you. Brother, nothing will happen to you.
 I am here, brother. Brother! Where are you going now? My friends have come over,
 they are waiting for me. And…and me? What about me waiting for you, 
for so long? You, go to sleep. I will be late. Nosherwan… Don’t you miss me? We are going to get married. I tried hard to stop it, but I was unsuccessful. I am surely getting married, but only because of 
Baba Saeein, and Amma. It is their wish that 
the children and you always live in this mansion. There should be 
no change in your life. If something will change,
 then it will be in me. I will never be able to 
accept this wedding. It will be no less than a test 
for me to see you in this form, after seeing you in the 
form of my sister-in-law. If you want, you can say no to this wedding. Imagine, if this wedding takes place, then you will surely be my wife, I will also give you 
the right to be my wife, but don’t expect love from me. Hi. Hi. What happened? Nothing. What will happen? Are you feeling okay? You were not even coming to 
university for so many days. I am fine. What will happen to me? What happened? You will tell me, that. Did you talk to Faraz? He seemed really restless for you. Who told you? Brother Fahad? Don’t take his name. Damned man. Why? What happened? Did you two fight? Fight? I used to fight daily. But, I broke up with him last night. Break up? Yes, so what could I do? He turned out to be a weird psycho. And on top of that, a big miser. I had asked him to take 
me shopping once, but no, he was saying no to me for so long. Last night, he was 
saying to me that I don’t have money to 
take you shopping. Leave it. So I left him. The first one was fine, you know. At least, he would 
take me shopping. I feel that I got his curse. Now, how will I meet Faraz? Yes? Wow, you are really dressed up today. Yes, I had to get dressed today. I have to go to meet Dua. So, shall we go? No, man, I cannot go. Why? I had a fight with Rida, and she broke up with
 me in her anger. Then? Hey, then, why are you worried? Hey, did you find
 this time to break up? My love story hasn’t even started and you broke up? Hey, girls are in the habit 
of showing tantrums. First, they break up, 
then they mark off, then they put up weird statuses. And yes, remember, Dua will do the same. I am telling you. That poor thing doesn’t 
even have a phone. Hey, why don’t you do one thing? Look, you are going to 
meet her for the first time. She doesn’t have a phone, you gift her a phone. She will be happy and your work will be easy too. Look, brother, how long will you hide from her father and drop letters to her? This is right. Okay fine, I will go. I have to go with Papa for some work. We will meet again. Yes, I am going to meet her for the first time, so I will need your car. Yes, your idea is good. Go have fun. Here you go. Okay fine, best of luck. Yes. Yes, son, how are you? Greetings. Greetings. So, is all okay? Thank God. Is the work going fine? Yes, work is fine. Where is your Papa? Papa is not here. Do you want something important? Yes, I had something important to do. Son, I had to give him money. This is twenty-five thousand. Okay. Inform your Papa and add it to the accounts. The old account is cleared. I will give the money to Papa. Okay, I will go. Okay fine. Okay, son? I will give him the money. You are going to meet 
her for the first time. She doesn’t have a phone, you gift her a phone. This place of yours has 
so much peace and beauty. Whenever I come here, I find a lot of happiness. In fact, will you always 
keep me happy like this? Don’t you believe me? More than myself. I am going to change this 
belief of yours into truth. I am going to talk to 
Baba Saeein, about our proposal. Really? Really! But, if he doesn’t agree, then? Still, no one can 
separate me from you. Promise? I promise. And you know how steadfast
 I am in my promises.
