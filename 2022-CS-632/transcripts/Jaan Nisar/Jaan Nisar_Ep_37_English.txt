You, won’t you forgive me? You haven't done anything that
you will have to apologize for. No, I have said a lot of nonsensical things. What should I do? Sir’s call is not going through, let me call sir. Hello. Sir, Bano speaking. Tell me. Sir, madam has taken
a lot of sleeping pills. What rubbish? Yes, sir, she looks very critical. Where were you? Sir, I was cooking. She waited for you all day and then got angry and now, sir, do me a favor and come quickly. I am coming. You call the ambulance. Okay, sir. You do one thing, go home, I am here. No, I will stay here. You are going to have dinner with me. Why are you forcing me when I am telling you something? You are considering my wish
to be my stubbornness? So then be it. If you go from here today, I won’t eat anything. Sister-in-law,
I cannot be brave like you, I cannot marry someone
I don’t know as you did. Do you think I don’t see how brother is always
pushing you away? He scolds you over every petty thing, he doesn’t take care of you at all. No, sister-in-law, I cannot marry someone I don’t know and I don’t love. Sarfaraz, Sarfaraz, are you listening to me? I am not deaf, I can hear you. No, that’s not what I was saying. So, then what did you say? Sarfaraz, have you ever thought about our child? Yes, I did and I don’t want to have one. Why? Why are you saying this? Because I don’t want to have it. A child is a blessing from God and the biggest happiness of life. Yes, it definitely is happiness, it definitely is, but for the ones whose marriage is also their happiness but for me, this marriage is a punishment and it is the kind of punishment I am not getting rid of. If you disliked me so much, you could have rejected this proposal. But no, if you disliked me, you would have told me at first sight. But Sarfaraz, you, you were so happy with me, so what happened all of a sudden? Right now, you don’t have so much value that you ask me a question, do you understand? And you want to know about a child. Yes, so I have thought about it, I will have a child but not from you. Child, child, child. Look, I know that you have been
very hurt because of me and I am also regretting
a lot because of that. Your regret won’t fill my empty lap. My baby left this world before
I could even hold him in my hands. Fiza but don’t you worry, I am with you. God will bless us
with another child and this time I promise you that I will take very good care of you. She has been shifted to the room. She is fine now. Doctors have said they will keep
her under observation all night. You can go home if you want, the situation is in control now. No, first let me meet her. Why have you become
the enemy of your life? What should I do with such a life which doesn’t have you in it? Why are you being
stubborn like a child? You can live a good, better life, Farah please grow up. I don’t want such a life where you aren’t there. Please, for God’s sake,
I have moved on, you must forget everything
and move on too, please. Don’t give me such
a big punishment for my mistake, I cannot live without you. You don’t want to be mine, right? Don’t be. Go back to your world but then it shouldn’t matter to you
whether I live or die after that. I know that there is no place
for me in your world. But I cannot allow anyone to come to my house and make me realize that you can never be mine, I wasn’t able to bear it, I couldn’t bear it so I took this step. Who came to your house? Who are you talking about? Your wife, Dua. She has clearly said to me if I didn’t distance myself from you, I don’t know, I don’t know, what she might do to me. Take out all these fears
and frights from your mind because your fate is now connected to Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s fate. I am putting this house in your ownership. What’s the need for it? There is, for sure. At least you won’t have the fear that if I leave you in the future,
where would you go? It means that you have
plans to leave me? Never. I have held this hand forever. I won't ever leave you, trust me and my love as well. I won’t let you live happily married, I will only be at peace after
taking you out of Ghaznavi’s life. The Doctor said that
they will discharge you by morning but you won’t do such
stupidity ever again. I won’t do it if you say so. I am saying it to you. I will try. Bano will stay here with you tonight. You stay, please. If you will stay here my frustration
might stay in control as well, otherwise, I don’t know, I might do something again. Please, for me, just tonight, I promise, please. Okay. Thank you. What rubbish? Where were you? You call the ambulance. You are alone there while 
Ghaznavi is here with me. Now, you can guess who is more important in his life. Where are you guys coming from? You and your sir went to
Farah’s house, right? You won’t say it, right? Because you are loyal to your sir. Where were you all night? Hospital. Farah took sleeping pills. Didn’t she die? I am surprised, she always survives every time
after multiple suicide attempts. Why did you go there? So, she told you? So, when I told you there
is nothing between us, why do you want to prove me
wrong by doubting me? Why don’t you get it? I am trying to prove you wrong or are you denying what you said? I am denying? Yes, you are. You said it in front of
Baba Saaein and Amma Saeein that you have no place
for her in your heart so then why, why do you go running to her
when she calls you once? Tell me. Do you have an answer? On humanitarian grounds. She could have died. But she didn’t die. Okay, enough! You won’t keep any terms with her, you won’t go there. I will be in terms with her, till you have some connection with her, I will stay in terms with her. And, and why shouldn’t I talk to her? She can destroy my home and I will just watch in
the corner as a silent spectator? Your home is not that weak, Dua, that it can break if anyone tries a little. You were with her all night, you were attending to her, the home is already broken. I am sad to know that
your belief is so weak. I felt sad too, knowing that you denied your words. Sumbul, I am, I am very scared. Sister-in-law, what will happen to me if you are scared? How we are going to meet Khizer, if your brother finds out, I swear to God, he will kill me. How will brother know? He is at the office, right? And we will come early before he returns. I don’t know why I feel that what we are
doing is not right, Sumbul. Sister-in-law, you, just once, just once try talking to Khizer, if he doesn’t seem sincere to you, I will quietly marry Fahad. But please, at least meet him once. What you have said has convinced me. Now that I have agreed to go along, I cannot back out. Thank God, let’s go now. Okay, let’s go. Let’s go. One second, let me take my bag. Let’s go now, you’re ready! Where are you both going? And you, you just came back from school and you are ready to
go out again? Yeah? Don’t you feel like staying home? Umm, we are going to the market, market, we had to buy some stuff, I told you, right? You did tell me, you did tell me but you didn’t tell me
you will go in this heat, you can go in the evening. The evening will be very late if we go in the evening,
it will take us very long in the market, it will be night by then
and it will get dark, Dad will be home and
brother will be home too, and you know brother’s nature, he will dig into the depths of it and he will scold us too, so that is why I thought if we go right now,
we will be back by the evening, right? Let’s go, sister-in-law. Okay go, but come back soon and you. Yes? Don’t make her wander
around the market a lot, do you understand? Mom? Sister-in-law is not taking me, I am taking sister-in-law. Aren’t you getting late now? Yes, we are leaving. Let’s go, sister-in-law. Bye. Bye. Defending her sister-in-law. How are you feeling now? I am feeling good now
that you are here. Okay, you have to take
care of yourself now, and one more thing, if you make such
a mistake ever again, I won’t ever come to meet you. When you are close to me, I start loving my life. Did you take your medicine? No. I am sure you didn’t
have lunch either, right? I was waiting for you. You will get unwell again if you
don’t take care of yourself, please. Everything gets fine
when you are close to me, when you leave, everything starts going wrong. I will ask Bano to serve food to you. You must have had lunch with Dua. No, I am coming here directly from the office. Yeah, so okay then, I'll get the lunch laid for both of us. You didn’t come yesterday, sister? Yes, because Amma Saeein and
Baba Saeein were here, that’s why. Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein? His parents. Oh okay. That’s what I was saying too that she must have been
occupied with something, that is why she didn’t come. So, tell me, how are they? Are they nice to you? They are very nice to me, takes very good care of me and loves me a lot. Look they gave me these
bangles as a wedding gift. Sister, they look so beautiful. Really, okay then, take this and try wearing them. Hey no, your mother-in-law has
given them to you, don’t wear them. So what? She will fulfill her wish. They look much nicer in your hands. They are very beautiful. Sania, my child, Sania? Yes, Dad? Yes, my child, take this, these are snacks, piping hot snacks, feed them, feed them to Dua. Ok Dad still doesn’t know how to show
off his love to his daughters. No problem, at least he has started to realize. All this will get cold while talking. Take this out as well and make tea along with it for us.
Okay. Are you happy? Very happy. Okay, your mother-in-law
met you for the first time, I mean, this wedding gift, didn’t she give it earlier? No, she met me for the first time. Why? Weren’t they ready for your
and Nosherwan’s marriage? No, they weren’t earlier but then now thank God everything is well. Mom, don’t worry yourself
by getting into all this. They are very nice,
they take very good care of me, they love me a lot and I am very happy. Hmm? Yes. Where is Khizer? I don’t know, he was saying I am just five minutes away, 
on my way. See, we might be late. Even the messages
aren’t getting delivered now. I guess there are signal issues here. Sister-in-law, shall I go out and talk? Yes, go quickly. Greetings. Greetings. I am sure you must be sister-in-law Fiza. Yes. The way Sumbul has introduced you, I can’t make any mistake in recognizing you. Can I sit here if you allow it? Yes, yes, why not? Sit. Sister-in-law, Sumbul? She just went out to call you, there were some signal issues here. Actually, sister-in-law,
I barely get any time while I am on duty, I came because you called me, sorry, Sumbul wanted me to meet you. Hey, where have you brought me? Prawn karahi is amazing here, you just try it, and you will praise it then. Let’s see how your prawn karahi is. Come. I do have an idea why Sumbul
wants me to meet you. She must have told you, there is a proposal being considered for her. Her wedding is being fixed, just consider it has been already fixed. Yes, she told me. So, won’t you take a stand?
