[29.93] Hey, today you came home early.
[40.97] Why did you go to meet Sarfaraz?
[47.03] I went to meet Mother.
[50.60] If you really went to meet Mother,
then what is all this?
[56.40] Even after all this evidence,
you're still lying to me?
[60.07] I... I did go to meet Mother.
[63.37] I ran into Sarfaraz on the way.
[71.43] How did he know you'd be
taking that route?
[73.87] How did he know?
[94.27] Certainly, before meeting,
[97.53] a person calls and decides on a place.
[106.40] Sarfaraz's call is proof of that.
[109.53] What should I make of all this?
[116.47] No…
[117.73] It was just a coincidence.
[125.37] He called me because
[127.23] he wanted to meet, so he called me.
[130.53] In what capacity did he call you?
[132.73] Why did he want to meet?
What did he need to talk about?
[138.87] I stopped the car for this reason,
to talk to him and ask.
[147.03] You can lie to me this much?
I never could have imagined.
[152.13] I am not lying to you.
[160.23] I met Sarfaraz on the way,
[162.03] I didn’t plan it. If you want…
[164.57] you… you can ask the driver,
[168.17] you can ask the guard,
I was going to my mother’s house.
[170.63] Yes, only when you go
to your mother’s place
[171.77] will you get a chance to meet Sarfaraz.
[181.83] Ghaznavi,
[187.87] you…
[188.67] you're misunderstanding me completely.
[192.37] No,
[199.23] I'm no longer under
any misunderstanding about you.
[207.13] Now, that misunderstanding
has been cleared.
[234.57] My phone...
[242.37] You did all of this?
[247.20] How did you get pictures
of me and Sarfaraz?
[250.13] I just got them from somewhere.
[252.67] Are you concerned about the pictures,
or is it something else?
[258.97] What are you doing?
[260.77] You've put spies on me?
[264.40] With a woman like you,
[267.83] spying is necessary.
[273.77] Even Nosherwan Saeein should know
[276.73] what kind of woman his wife is.
[281.23] You’re playing with fire.
[283.23] Oh, I really don’t want to play with fire,
[290.27] that’s why I’m telling you
[292.27] to quietly go back to your parents’ house.
[299.87] Or, if you don't want to go there,
[302.87] go to Sarfaraz.
[304.63] Isn't that the best option?
[310.43] What hasn't he done for you?
[312.40] He’s made so many big sacrifices,
[313.87] even left his wife for you.
[319.97] Yet you’re still torturing him.
[322.00] Go to your lover!
[323.43] Enough!
[327.13] Stay within your limits.
[328.97] Stay within my limits?
[330.67] You’re telling me to
stay within my limits?
[333.07] And what about you?
[334.63] I know very well how to
deal with women like you.
[343.83] Next time if try to speak to me like this,
[346.93] I’ll remind you of all your limits.
[375.43] Hey, what are you guys doing?
[378.47] What’s going on here?
[380.43] Don’t you know how to behave?
[383.17] Is this how you play?
[386.57] In what manner are
you talking to the kids?
[389.27] Nosherwan, look what
they’ve done to the room.
[391.77] Something might break…
[392.57] If the room is messed up then
here are servants in the house,
[395.23] they will clean it up.
[401.93] Why are you shouting at them?
[403.17] I am not shouting I am just…
[404.17] Enough,
[407.43] don’t talk to the kids like this again.
[409.37] I won’t tolerate it.
[416.37] Arham, Mizna, come here.
[420.97] What were you doing?
[422.03] Why did you mess up
the room so much?
[423.40] I’ve told you to stay in your room.
[425.20] Now you have got yourself insulted.
[426.23] No, why should the kids
play in their room?
[431.60] This entire house is theirs.
They’ll play wherever they want,
[435.13] and no one will stop them.
[441.00] Nosherwan, you don’t understand.
[445.03] Maybe Dua doesn’t like me
or the kids being in this house.
[461.20] Ever since we’ve come here,
[463.27] she has had a lot of issues.
[470.43] If it weren't for Mizna and
Amma Saeein’s medical tests,
[473.47] I would have left for
the mansion long ago.
[488.53] If there's so much of a problem
with me and the kids,
[491.77] then I’ll call Amma Saeein
[494.17] and go back to the mansion.
[495.73] No one is going anywhere.
[509.17] Everyone will stay here.
[527.53] Let’s go.
[563.17] I’m ashamed.
[570.63] I shouldn’t have scolded
the kids like that.
[574.83] I don’t need your clarifications.
[577.93] I’m not clarifying.
[580.27] I just realized it,
that’s why I’m apologizing.
[587.23] I’ll explain to the kids.
[590.47] Do whatever you want.
Just go from here.
[594.73] Does my presence here
bother you this much?
[598.43] Yes,
[604.33] if I say that your presence makes
me question my patience,
[607.43] it wouldn’t be wrong.
[614.53] So it’s better,
[616.80] while I’m still angry,
you keep out of my sight.
[620.40] Go away.
[680.63] Yesterday,
[681.73] I scolded you guys too much, right?
[684.57] I’m sorry.
[685.53] Grown-ups don’t hold their ears,
[687.60] right?
[688.27] Kids hold their ears
[689.83] when the teacher says so.
[693.83] But if grown-ups make mistakes,
[696.60] they should also hold their ears.
[698.63] Sorry.
[700.87] You shouldn’t apologize.
[702.40] The mistake was ours.
[704.23] We were misbehaving.
[706.23] He was the one
who started the game first.
[709.03] And who started jumping on the bed?
[711.20] You said it.
[712.13] Alright, fine, fine,
[713.57] let’s do one thing,
[714.83] from now on the three
of us will play together.
[717.00] Okay?
[717.53] Okay.
[718.73] Mizna, Arham,
[720.23] the noodles are ready. Let’s go!
[722.47] Noodles!
[725.03] Okay
[742.43] Get out of my way.
[745.00] Why don’t you let out
the anger you have inside?
[753.93] If you’ve started hating me,
[757.53] then express that hate openly.
[764.87] Tell me,
[767.23] have you started hating me?
[770.60] When the time is right,
I will tell you this too.
[793.93] Who knew our daughters
would have such fates?
[799.60] We had to face someone
like Sarfaraz, a beast.
[808.73] He destroyed and
ruined our daughters' lives.
[814.03] Why are you thinking
of past things now?
[816.80] They have their
whole life ahead of them,
[818.00] think about the future for the girls.
[822.03] What will we do?
[825.13] Let the baby be born first.
[831.23] Then I’ll find a good match for her
and get her married.
[834.87] What else can I do?
[837.20] I don’t want to get married.
[847.63] I...
[849.63] I will spend my life with my child.
[852.63] But please,
[854.57] take the thought of my marriage
out of your hearts.
[863.20] But, child,
[865.37] how will you live such a long life?
[867.97] And what about my child...
[870.37] he will also live like an orphan,
[874.23] only because of Dua.
[877.00] If Dua hadn’t come into Sarfaraz’s life,
[879.60] none of this would have
happened to me. Mother,
[884.07] whatever my life is, long or short,
[888.23] however long it may be,
[889.40] I will live it with my child.
[891.83] But please don’t talk
to me about marriage,
[893.40] it frightens me.
[897.43] I fear that
[899.83] someone like Dua will again
become an obstacle in my path,
[905.27] and I’ll be punished for sins
I didn’t commit.
[916.23] What was my mistake?
[918.23] What sin did I commit?
[921.00] I always followed the principles
you set for me, Father.
[923.83] But what happened? Tell me!
[926.57] Dua’s sin is now a stain on
my life in the form of divorce.
[931.03] And my child,
[932.63] despite having a father,
will be deprived.
[936.27] Look, dear,
[937.60] Dua did very wrong.
[939.77] We all agree on that.
[943.67] She did something very bad. But
[945.37] she’s asking for forgiveness,
she’s remorseful.
[947.17] Forgive your sister.
[948.47] Don’t hold a grudge against her.
[950.73] I’m not holding a grudge, Father.
[955.80] Why don’t you all understand?
[957.73] Whatever happened to
me was because of Dua.
[960.43] If she hadn’t come
between us that day,
[962.43] Sarfaraz wouldn’t have divorced me.
[965.97] Sarfaraz divorced
me only because of Dua.
[969.00] He even confessed in front of all of you,
[970.77] so why don’t you understand?
[972.83] The disaster falling on me and
my unborn child is solely because of Dua,
[979.43] and I can never forgive her for it.
[982.60] Hey, Fiza,
[984.43] listen to me.
[986.83] Child…
[993.17] Oh God.
[1009.63] You’re still upset?
[1016.43] I told you, that I…
[1017.57] I’m feeling sleepy. Go to sleep.
[1100.20] I want to eat ice cream.
[1102.13] Me too,
[1103.63] but who will take us?
[1105.73] We’ll go anyway, I want it.
[1107.93] What’s all the noise about?
[1109.57] Come here,
[1110.17] what happened?
[1110.63] Why are you making
so much noise?
[1111.23] I want ice cream, I want, I want!
[1113.67] You can’t eat ice cream right now,
[1115.60] no ice cream for you.
[1116.83] But I want to eat ice cream!
I want, I want, I want!
[1119.03] What’s wrong?
[1121.43] Uncle, I want to eat ice cream.
[1125.27] Look at her,
[1126.93] she’s insisting on eating ice cream.
[1129.63] Her health just got better
after such difficulty.
[1131.83] If she eats ice cream,
she’ll get sick again.
[1134.73] It’s been a week
since her health improved,
[1138.40] she can eat one ice cream.
[1140.23] I’ll get it,
[1141.27] Jafar.
[1142.07] No, Uncle,
[1143.13] I don’t want to eat ice cream at home.
[1144.77] I want to eat it outside.
[1146.23] It’s so much fun eating
ice cream outside!
[1148.47] Yes, Uncle,
[1149.47] we’ll go outside and eat ice cream,
[1150.73] it’s so much fun!
[1151.77] Okay, so you all want to
eat ice cream outside?
[1154.53] Yes.
[1155.47] Then what are we waiting for?
[1157.27] Let’s go!
[1158.27] Yay!
[1159.40] But Uncle,
[1160.53] take Aunt with us too.
[1162.03] Yeah!
[1172.13] No kids, just us.
[1177.93] Let’s go!
[1223.93] Sakina.
[1228.40] Yes
[1229.93] Please bring a strong cup of tea for me.
[1231.77] I have a bad headache.
[1233.27] Yes, I’ll bring it right away.
[1370.77] I knew it.
[1376.77] You can't stay angry with me for long.
[1385.63] You...
[1389.33] what are you doing here?
[1430.00] What’s going on here?
[1439.07] You...
[1440.60] you called him to the room, Dua?
[1444.13] No.
[1445.83] You should be ashamed of yourself.
[1452.97] No, I don't know how he came here.
[1455.73] I don’t know!
[1457.23] Dua,
[1458.43] If the truth is out, then don’t lie.
[1467.83] Tell everyone the truth, now.
[1478.77] Stop with the nonsense,
[1479.97] there’s nothing like that.
[1480.83] Really, believe me.
[1491.13] Today, no one can stop
me from killing him!
[1495.37] Ghaznavi!
[1496.63] What was the need to do this, huh?
[1499.37] I don’t know how he got here.
[1506.20] Nosherwan!
[1509.57] Ghaznavi!
[1510.53] Ghaznavi, no!
[1512.00] For God’s sake please don’t.
[1520.97] Please don’t kill him,
[1522.20] please, please don’t do this.
[1528.97] See?
[1532.20] Even now, she still cares
so much about him.
[1541.77] Fine, Dua. I’m leaving.
[1545.27] Neither am I afraid of him nor his gun.
[1556.23] Go away from here.
[1588.17] Nosherwan
[1622.00] What is all this?
[1623.03] Whose stuff is this?
[1625.03] He sent Fiza’s stuff back,
what else?
[1636.87] Was it necessary to cause
this pain after the divorce?
[1645.27] He had to complete the procedure.
He sent the stuff back,
[1649.03] the poor guy was very distressed.
He called and was crying.
[1656.00] What’s the point of
sending this stuff back?
[1659.23] Our wounds will stay
fresh seeing all this.
[1661.93] Look, sending the stuff
was their responsibility,
[1663.83] and they fulfilled it.
[1665.60] Now what’s the use
of talking about this?
[1673.80] As soon as I see you,
I start losing control.
[1676.87] I don’t know
[1678.83] why it feels like you’ve
cast a spell on me.
[1685.27] Am I right?
[1702.73] I consider myself lucky
[1708.33] to have your hand in mine.
[1713.23] Me too
[1716.23] And this will stay like this forever.
[1718.83] Mine and yours, our journey
together was only till here.
[1746.83] How long has all
this been going on?
[1749.63] Huh,
[1752.60] All this was happening
behind our backs?
[1764.80] So Sarfaraz was right...
[1766.60] Yes?
[1768.17] This child then.
[1769.03] Why are you talking about?
[1779.47] I don’t know.
[1780.80] I really don’t know how he got here.
[1790.37] Now that’s what you’ll say.
[1797.27] The guard,
[1798.23] the caretaker,
all of them are lying?
[1799.93] They said Sarfaraz keeps coming
to meet you with your consent.
[1807.87] Now that you’re caught, deny it all.
[1809.60] Ghaznavi, she’s lying.
[1811.60] I’m telling the truth.
[1812.73] When someone is caught,
they say the same….
[1819.40] You,
[1820.17] you do believe what I’m saying, right?
[1822.80] Yes, everyone’s lying,
[1824.80] and only you are telling the truth.
[1833.87] If nothing was going on
between the two of you,
[1836.07] then why didn’t you let me kill him?
[1837.63] Why did you shield him from me?
[1842.03] I didn’t want you to be
called his murderer.
[1844.87] I didn’t want you to kill him.
[1846.40] Whatever was supposed to happen to me,
I would’ve let it happen.
[1855.23] A man comes into my house,
[1856.80] plays with my honor right in front of me,
[1858.80] and is still alive only because of you.
[1862.63] You saved him.
[1868.17] You’re misunderstanding me.
[1874.67] How do I explain to you
[1876.97] that what you saw wasn’t the truth?
[1879.77] I’ve understood everything about
what’s true and what’s false.
[1891.73] I leave you,
[1894.13] and then you go straight to Sarfaraz?
[1895.57] That’s your plan, right?
The two of you?
[1909.63] As long as I’m alive,
I won’t let that happen.
[1918.20] You’ll stay in this house.
[1925.03] I won’t leave you until my last breath.
[1937.97] But now,
[1940.97] I’ll never turn to look
at your face again.
[1948.00] Ghaznavi,
[1953.77] Ghaznavi! Please listen to me,
[1955.63] please.
[1983.03] I don’t know why
he was saying all that.
[1986.13] Who else would know?
[1987.47] Why are you asking me?
[1989.13] Should I ask a third person
about you and Sarfaraz?
[1992.23] Who should I ask?
[1995.37] I have no relationship with him.
[1997.20] Right,
[1999.80] you have no connection with him.
[2001.23] Then why is he saying all this nonsense?
[2008.40] I’ll ask you directly then.
[2012.80] Who is the father of this child?
