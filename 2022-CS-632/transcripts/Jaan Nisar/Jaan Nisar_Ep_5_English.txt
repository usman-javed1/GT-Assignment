Who are you to decide my marriage? I will do whatever is needed, and Uncle, you must listen too, your daughter will only get married to me, even if you tried, I will pick her up and take her away. 
How dare you? You are talking about taking a girl away
from my village in front of me? How dare you? What do you think, I will spare you? No, Sir, No, have mercy, Sir, Dad is lying, I love him. And if Dad gets me married to 
anyone else apart from him, I will take poison and die. If you want to shoot, 
shoot both of us. If we cannot live together, we can at least die together. You shameless woman! Why didn’t you die before doing 
such a shameful act? She hasn’t done anything wrong, She just implemented her right. she has the right to marry 
by her choice and what is your objection 
when your daughter and this boy is ready to get married? Sir, how should I get her married 
to this lazy guy? How can I just ruin my daughter’s fate? He doesn’t do any work. Why don’t you work? I am looking for work, Sir, I will do it as soon as I get it. Hmm, will you get your daughter married
to him if he gets some work? Sir, I will, when he gets a job but 
I know he won’t do any work. Just consider he got a job. Come to the mansion from tomorrow, Jaffar will let you know your job. Thank you so much, Sir, Thank you so much. The boy got the job, start the wedding preparations now. And there is no need to beat or imprison your daughter, next time. Get your daughter married 
where her heart wants, hmm? Long Live Sir! Long Live Sir! Long Live Sir! *chanting continues* She is so beautiful, right?
She is so beautiful, look at her hands, 
they are as white as milk. Yes, she is very beautiful. Who are you guys praising so much? Sister in law. Sister in law? What do you mean? Oh so you guys
 are back from there? We saw her and we liked her as well, she is very beautiful. I admit, you have learned to lie. I don’t lie. No, no, she is not lying at all my daughter in law is very pretty, 
very beautiful. Oh okay, so that means you have already 
made her your daughter in law? She was so beautiful, 
I immediately said yes, I really liked her. Who is this fairy-like that you guys have been 
parsing for so long? She is separately false praising her. I am not false praising, shall I show you the picture right now? See, did you see how beautiful she is? yes, they are very modest 
and conservative people, and my daughter in law - to be 
is also very modest. They don’t even get pictures clicked, I asked for her picture but they refused that we don’t have
 this tradition here. They refused but I cleverly took it
secretly, no one found out. Hey, don’t discuss this in front of 
Fehmida or her husband even by mistake, they might dislike that we have taken their daughter’s
picture without consent. Greetings. Greetings, Dad. Greetings. 
Greetings. Come, come, sit. 
Go get water. I will get it. It looks like you guys have 
come back from the girl’s place. Yes, yes, I did, in fact, I have also invited them 
to come to my place so they can see Sarfaraz once. Oh that’s great that 
you invited them and I am happier about the fact that it looks like you liked 
the girl at first sight. To be honest, I really dislike those families who would go to see the girl and 
would just come back after eating, it feels like they have gone to choose
 the sacrificial animal instead of a girl. Doing tea and refreshment 
in the match-making process pointlessly drains the white-collar families and the girl stays at home as well. You are so right. Okay tell me did you tell them we don’t want dowry? No, I went there for the first time, how could I mention this? and we are not making any demands 
for the dowry to them, we cannot stop them from giving 
their daughter what they want. By the way, you are right, but when they will come here
 I will inform them that we don’t need the dowry at all, They should just relax and 
get their daughter married. Thank you, daughter. This world will become so beautiful if every person starts 
thinking like you, Dad. I also have a lovely daughter, that is why I can feel the pain 
of other’s daughters. Shall I make tea for you? 
Will you have it? I will definitely have it if 
my daughter is making it for me. I will just get it. Fahad is calling, 
I will go and talk. Hey, tell me, what does Sarfaraz 
think about the girl? That is what I was noticing that he is not very happy, I think he is not mentally ready
 to get married but it’s okay, I will talk to him. Piping hot. Look, you are not cooking with heart, 
Fehmida Begum, there is less salt and more spice. Okay, I don’t know how that happen. Yes, you don’t know anything about
what happens in the world. I will be careful next time. And listen, did you reprimand Nasiban for bringing the guys casually like this? Yes, actually Aunt Nasiban had to 
go somewhere in the evening so that is why they came and sister Kausar was apologizing. Okay so what did they say? 
When will they respond? They really liked our Fiza. 
why wouldn’t they? They said yes and also 
invited us to their home. Okay then, do one thing, tell them that my daughter’s won’t come 
in front of any man. yes, but they didn’t say 
any such thing that their men will come 
to see Fiza, obviously, Aunt Nasiban 
must have told them about the mentality of 
this house and you. That’s good. Mr Aslam, if it is a yes from you, should I send a message 
through Aunt Nasiban. Yes, I guess Friday would be fine. Tell them that we won’t come 
untimely like they did, we will come at the time of Asr. Okay fine. Have salad too. Hey give me the money 
Mr Maqsood has given so I can add them to the accounts. What happened? Give me the money. Hunh? What is this? 5000 Rupees? He told me he had given 
25000 Rupees so he has lied to me, let me ask him right now, 
what is this way? There are so many liars 
in this world, right? Dad, don’t call him. Hunh, why not? He came to the shop and
 gave me 25000 rupees. if he gave you 25000 rupees 
so where is the rest of the amount? Hey I am asking you something, where are the remaining 
20,000 rupees? Dad, I spent them. Spent them? Where did you spend them? I got out on my bike, 
it stopped working so when I got it checked, 
it turned out that there is a problem in the engine, and then you know another 
work comes up from one, so this entire thing costed me 20,000. You spent 20,000 rupees 
on the bike? So what else should have I done?
 I was helpless, Dad. Helpless, how? You roam around here and 
there on the bike all day, you don’t get anything out of it, and on top of that 
you spent the money from the shop on your bike, 
20,000 rupees. so, what else should have I done? 
Where else would I get the money from? Do some work then! When I ask you to sit at 
the shop it's against your standards, if you don’t want to sit at the shop and do some royal job 
then at least look for one. So then I will look for it. You will look for it? Look at your son, you want to marry him, you are looking for
 a daughter in law, just think again before ruining 
some girl’s life. So like I am dying to get married. I don’t want to get married right now, I will get married when I get a job,
 I will find it myself. He just taunts me on 
everything for no reason. Did you see his attitude? It feels like we are not taking care of him
but he is taking care of us instead. So what? He is a young boy and they have a lot of expenses, he did tell you though that 
where he spent the money, he didn’t spend it on partying, he only used it for his motorbike. Even if he spent some money, 
what’s wrong with that? You have no value of 20,000 rupees? You are calling it some money? Even Nowadays it’s a person’s 
full month’s salary. Sometimes you look like 
a vendor to me. Wow, they don’t understand how much time it takes to 
earn 20,000 rupees. if Dad gets me married to 
anyone else apart from him, I will take poison and die. If you want to shoot, 
shoot both of us. If we cannot live together, we can at least die together. Please Farah, quiet now, 
what’s wrong with you? with me, after betraying me big time
you are asking me to get quiet? I didn’t betray you, 
I have been betrayed. I didn’t know that they were calling me
back from the hostel to the mansion to get me married to my sister in law 
right after her waiting period is over, I had no idea about it. Nosherwan, you could have refused. I did refuse, I did it multiple times, there were a lot of guests at home so I couldn’t put Baba Saeein’s honor at stake. There are other people in the world 
whose sister in laws become a widow too, they don’t just get them married 
to their brother in laws. I know that, Farah, I didn’t want to betray you 
so I am telling you beforehand. you know what, all this wouldn’t have happened 
had you spoken to your Baba Saeein about us earlier. Okay, I will talk to Baba Saeein again. What will you say now when you never spoke to him 
about us earlier. And what do you think your Baba Saeein got you married to your 
sister in law for the sake of his family’s honor, now will he let you divorce her? Or will you go against your Amma Saeein and
Baba Saeein and divorce your sister in law? I don’t know but I will tell Baba Saeein that 
I love you a lot, I cannot live without you. I am sure he will listen to me. You will have to live without me, because you know Nosherwan I can’t share you with anybody else, you know that. Relax. Farah, listen to me, you cannot leave me like this, 
I am saying I will talk to him. You have separated our ways, not me. Farah please, don’t leave me like this. Farah, listen to me, I am saying something to you. At least someone should 
get their love, why do I miss you again and again? Hello? The whole day has gone by, 
what is this behavior? I was waiting for your call for so long. Actually, Mom saw the phone. Oh yes, No, I kind of got 
an idea at that time, That is why I didn’t call back but still you have made me wait for so long,
And I have waited a lot for you. How could I call you 
in front of everyone? I just got a chance right now. Yes. Anyway, tell me how did you satisfy Aunt? I told her that it is Rida’s phone 
and I would return it to her tomorrow. Look, now you have to be a bit cautious, you have to be careful. Leave that to me. Oh yes, I can leave this to you but I cannot leave you. Anyway, my day wasn’t good today, I was very restless, I was just thinking what must 
have happened to you all day, I was worried for you. I hope Mom didn’t scold you much. No, what are you doing? Nothing, I was just missing you. Why didn’t you sleep yet? When do I have sleep in my fate now? Ever since I have seen you, my eyes always hope to 
see you somehow, I just want to see you. Is that how much you have 
started to love me? Yes, but the question is, do you love me as well? I won’t tell. Rida? Rida, Rida, Rida, look at this. Faraz gave it to me. Faraz has gifted it to you? So soon? I mean Fahad was very miser, he just gave one gift in 3 months and 
that too was a very useless one. I told you, Faraz is different. Oh please, everyone looks nice 
in the beginning, you get to know the reality later. Don’t you think that you have 
become a bit rude after breaking up with brother Fahad? Yes, maybe. Anyway, forget about me, tell me about yourself, 
now you have a phone, you guys must be chatting 
at night now, yeah? No, you know the environment of my house, when everyone goes to sleep, 
I have to wait, I am just able to talk to him after that
but that too for a very little time. Look at your eyes, 
they look full of sleep but you also have to come 
to the University else how will you meet Faraz? No, I don’t meet him and by the way, Dad has warned me that he will get me out of the university
if something happens again. I will have to sit at home then. Your Dad is actually very strict. Very much. 
Okay listen, tell me it’s functions, 
how does it get silent? I don’t understand anything. What’s so difficult in it? I will do it right now. All the phones have the same settings, you are using it right now so you will 
face a little difficulty in the beginning but then it will be fine. Okay, tell me, what did Faraz say 
regarding marriage? Will he marry you? He said he will just marry me, even if someone else forced him, he still wouldn’t marry anyone else. Really, wow Dua, your luck is shining. Tell me how to do it? Did you return the phone 
to your friend? Oh God, Mom, you start interrogating me 
before I even enter home. Answer to the question I asked. Yes, I gave it back. Open your bag and show it to me. You will check my bag? Don’t you trust me? Show me your bag I will be able
to trust you then. Are you satisfied now? You don’t trust your daughter at all. A daughter’s mother even has 
to trust with their eyes open. Change your clothes, 
I will take out food for you. Okay. Sir, this year the crop has been 
cut before the rain this time, that saved the crop too and we the profit has been 
more than 4 crores too and this is the amount 
for the sugarcane crop and it 6 times more than last year. Okay, keep it in my room, 
I will check it. Okay sir. Sir, food is ready, Bibi Saeein Jr has gotten 
all your favorite food made. the president has called me, I will have the food with him. Say thank you to your 
Bibi Saeein Jr on my behalf and ask her not to wait 
for me and eat. Okay Sir. It would have been so nice had Mom
and dad taken us with them, we would have seen 
brother groom as well. Yes. you should be thankful Mom 
and dad didn’t listen to this else you would have gotten a 
flying sandal coming towards you, it would have been so much fun. By the way, brother groom is very handsome, Dad will like him too. How should I accept, you guys didn’t even 
show me a picture. Where are you going? I am going to the roof to study. It’s almost evening, Dad wouldn’t like it when 
he comes back and sees you, he already doesn’t like you 
going to the roof. I feel that Mom and dad doesn’t 
generally like me at all. In fact, sometimes I feel I am not 
their biological daughter. You make everything complicated, I was saying this for your own good but no you have to make 
an issue out of everything. Even you have to scold me
over everything. Okay now if the teacher may allow me, can I go to the patio at the back 
and study? I hope you won’t get mad then? Go and you have your finance paper, take your book. Thank you. Hey Mr Aslam, I am very glad you came to 
our home on our invitation. We are very happy to meet you 
and your son as well. That is your greatness. Have something. Yes. Okay brother Aslam 
and sister Fehmida, we want the marriage 
to be a little soon, tell me whatever you guys have planned. When do you want the wedding? We were thinking of next month. Next month? Brother, isn’t that too early? How will we do the preparations? Sister Fehmida, look we don’t want dowry and whatever clothes and 
important things our daughter wants to bring 
with her is up to her. We don’t have any demands but if daughter Fiza wants 
to bring something herself then… he is so weird, he asks me to call him, and now when I am calling 
he is not picking up. Okay, date, what date are you guys
 thinking of? Date I was thinking that since all of us our together 
so let’s collectively decide a date. No problem. Son, whose call are you 
disconnecting again and again? Friends are bothering me, I told him you guys are coming
to see me today so… the boy is very good-looking. Hmmm. Have something, son. Dua? Yes? Dua? 
Yes? yes? I thought you must be 
craving tea while studying so I have made strong tea for you. My lovely sister, 
do you know if there are two to three sisters 
in the house like you, all the problems will be gone. 
ill-mannered. I have heard you have made 
a very good decision at the village council yesterday? Hmm, I am proud of my son. The right to marry by her choice 
was being taken away from a girl, you have earned reward 
by uniting two people who were in love with each other. that is what I expect from my son. Now you can take very good care 
of the mansion. No Baba Saeein, I will take care of the matters of the city, you are here to take care of the mansion. You have to come back here though, right? You get the food served. Go Kashmala, get the food served. Sure, Amma Saeein. I have eaten with the president 
of the council. Kashmala is still hasn’t eaten 
as she was waiting for you. Mom, I said I will eat out. She made all your favourite dishes 
with all her heart. Look Nosherwan, the decision to marry Kashmala 
to you was purely ours, we couldn’t have given Zavar’s widow
and the kids to any stranger but that is the past, the one who was your sister in law 
back then is now your wife and you have some responsibilities 
towards her, sit with her when you come 
to the mansion, spend time with her,
 talk to her. Has she complained to you? The poor girl will never complain but can’t I see her dull eyes? I admit that it is difficult for you to treat her 
as your wife, who was your sister in law back then but so many years have passed now, forget everything and start a new life with Kashmala. Mom, there is nothing like this, you are having illusions for now reason. Okay, I will go rest for a bit. Greetings. I am hungry, I haven’t eaten. I know, Amma Saeein told me, who you have complained about me. No. I didn’t complain. So you should have eaten, I didn’t stop you before eating. You are so stone-hearted, 
Nosherwan, I got the food made with 
so much love and affection, that we… 
Why do you do all this? What do you think, you will forcefully become 
my wife by doing all this? It is not about forcing, I am your wife. I don’t accept this relationship where two people are forcefully tied 
with each other. People respect you a lot, they consider you a very good son, the villagers trust you, you are loved by everyone. But just think when they will find out that a guy who is all for justice and 
truth hasn’t given the right to his wife, what will they think? They will laugh at you. They would stop trusting you. What do you want? I should stop coming 
to the mansion? Let me know if that’s how it is, 
I will do it. How can you do this, Nosherwan? If you do this, I will tell everyone that I am married to you but
you still don’t give me my right. You have said this today, don’t say it ever again, because next time you will even 
get deprived of this relationship that is based on papers 
if you say something like that.
