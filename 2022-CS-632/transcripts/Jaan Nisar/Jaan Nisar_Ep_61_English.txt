Mama, I am going to the hospital. Hospital? Is everything fine, child? Yes. Yes. It is just a routine checkup. I have an appointment with the doctor, 
that’s why I am going. So, will you go alone, child? 
I will come along with you. Hey, no, how will you go 
with me in this heat? Rickshaw, taxi, you will get tired. Okay, as you wish. Fiza, you too come with me. I don’t think you are fine. You too get your checkup done. The reason why I had to go 
to the doctor is no longer there, so, it is better that 
you mind your own business. Quietly go to wherever you are going. Bye. Yes, the condition is much better than before. You have improved a lot. I think Mr. Ghaznavi has 
started to care for you. Yes, he always cares for me a lot. If you continue to be cared for like this, then both you and your baby 
will be very healthy. You came alone today, 
didn’t Mr. Ghaznavi accompany you? No, I came alone. Take care of yourself the same way, there will be no complications. Yes, doctor. Okay, these are your medicines,
please take them regularly. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. Dua. What are you doing here? Is everything fine? You have come to the hospital. 
Is everything fine? Mind your own business. All this is happening because of you. Hey, listen to me. Ghaznavi. Ghaznavi, there is nothing like that. Somewhere in my heart, 
I had a thought that you have your checkup today, 
maybe, you will be alone. What if you need me? But coming here, 
I am realizing that I made a really big mistake once again. Whatever you saw is not the truth. Even after seeing everything with 
my own eyes, I was still denying myself. But today, you have proved 
my doubt to be the truth. Please believe me. Ghaznavi, please. Listen to me. Give me one chance to clarify. 
Ghaznavi… Tsk. Tsk. He doesn’t trust you at all. I don’t know how you manage with him. That’s why I am telling you to leave him
and come to me. Ghaznavi? You seem really angry. Did you meet her? For my sake, can you not leave her for some time? Nosherwan, even I am your wife, right? Please drop a few coins of time into 
my lap even if as mercy. Somewhere in my heart,
I had a thought that you have your checkup today,
maybe, you will be alone. What if you need me? But coming here,
I am realizing that I made a really big mistake once again. Yes. How did you remember someone 
as insignificant as me? I think you have started to believe my love. Sarfaraz, can you meet me? Hey, we met yesterday. 
Do you want to meet again? Yes. Can we not meet again? Hey, how is it possible for you 
to ask me and I say no? Hey, what could make me happier 
than the fact that you invited me? We will surely meet tomorrow. Fine, then we will meet today in the evening. Fine, we will meet in the evening. I am sending you the location. Okay. You are going to meet Sarfaraz. This is why Fiza’s home got ruined. Fiza’s doubt was correct. And we kept on trying to make her 
understand thinking that you were right. No. Fiza was absolutely right. She was right when she said an unjust 
cruelty had been done to her. No. And who is the one 
who did injustice to her? Her own blood sister. Hey, I feel ashamed thinking about it, and you didn’t feel ashamed doing it. Mom, you are considering me wrong. There is nothing like that. Stop this drama of yours. You are a liar, you are deceitful. When you have said it yourself 
that there is nothing between you two, then why are you going 
to meet Sarfaraz, huh? Did you not find peace ruining my home? What more do you want to do now? You all are putting me on trial 
without knowing the truth. Stop it. Stop this nonsense of yours, because we won't fall for 
the deception of your words, now. Did you see, Mama? Did you see her actions were 
always like this? No outsider spoiled my home, it was my blood sister. What more will you do now? Huh? Mama, all she will do is bring disgrace 
upon all of us, nothing more. Mama, no. Mama, believe me. Mama. When you called and 
wished to meet me, then, you have no idea how happy I became. When things had gone this far, I felt it was necessary for us to meet. That's why I called you. Yeah, Sumbul's wedding is happening, so I was a bit busy with that. But, when you called, 
I came immediately. Tell me, why did you call me? You… you tell me, what do you want? I called you to find out this. What do I want? I want you to come back 
to my life somehow. Even after knowing that 
I am married to Ghaznavi, and I am going to be 
the mother of his child? I know, and I can wait. If you can wait, then fine. I will marry you after getting 
a divorce from Ghaznavi. Really? Am I dreaming? And you agreed so easily. Well, when I have no place in Ghaznavi's life, I had to come to you, right? You are right. That’s how it is. Did you meet him? Yes. Why did you go? I had some work. What work did you want from him? Fiza, he has divorced you. You are no longer his wife. Whether I meet Sarfaraz 
or someone else, what problem do you have? Yes, I have a problem, 
that’s why I am asking you. Neither is he your husband 
nor are you his wife. You ruined my life on purpose, right? I consider you to be my own, but you 
turned out to be a snake in the sleeve. Even a witch leaves seven homes 
behind before devouring children, and you robbed your own sister's house! You will never be happy. You have ruined my home, 
you will never live in peace either. God will do justice. You will never be able 
to live happily. Leave me… Mama, she didn’t do good. She will regret it. God will do justice to her. She will never remain in peace, 
the same way she ruined my home, Mama. Mama, even she will never remain at peace. Sania, please make me a cup of tea. Mama, can I have some breakfast? Mama… It is better that you don’t talk to me. Why is she in this home? Why don’t you drag her out of here? When her character has been 
revealed to all of you, then how can you give her 
a place to stay in this home? Drag her out. She got a husband like Ghaznavi. She didn’t even value him. Fine, it is good. 
It is good he divorces her. But, when he divorces her, 
I am telling you both, she will never live here, 
and if she stays in this home, Mama, then I will not stay here. 
I cannot tolerate her face now. Be quiet, Fiza. Stop it. We will make her understand. No, you will make her understand right now. Talk to her and drag her out of here. Because she has made a 
mockery of life for far too long. She finds peace in 
our pain and suffering. It is my henna function too, but because of your stubbornness, 
it's happening on such a small scale. You have murdered my happiness. Who did you make all these preparations for? For me, right? Then why is there a need 
to show it to anyone else? Come on, we will do the ceremony. 
Come on. -Come, sister.
-Come on. Come, child, sit there. Come, sit. Mama, do you too consider me wrong? Don't you have faith in your upbringing? Not just me, everyone considers you wrong. It doesn’t matter to me 
what everyone else thinks. I just want to know 
what my mother thinks about me. Your mother always had 
a good opinion of you. You have proven me wrong. You set fire to your own sister's home and shattered my trust. I'm starting to regret my upbringing. How much more do we tolerate? Don't give me more pain, to the point where I start to think that giving birth to you was a sin. In fact, don't address me at all. Don't call me 'Mama'. I will never forgive you, 
for all the pain you've caused me. What happened? Did things work out? 
Did Dua come? Yes, Dua came. What did you talk to her about? She agrees to marry me. But, she has asked for some time. She says once the child is born, 
she will leave Ghaznavi, she will divorce him, 
and marry me. Did you record anything? Some voice recording? 
Some evidence? Recording. No, I didn’t record anything. Are you an idiot? You didn’t record something so big, 
so important. If there was evidence, I would have 
made Nosherwan listen to it. Yes, sorry, I had no idea 
why she had called me. It slipped my mind, 
I should have recorded it. I will be careful in the future. Next time, speak with a little more sense. Okay? I’m not going to keep explaining 
every little thing like you're a child. I don’t have the time to waste working 
with foolish, useless people. We’ll talk later. She is not even paying me, 
and then she is ordering me around. He spoiled my entire mood. Come on. Bring it. Yes. Did you serve everything?
Fine, I will dish it out, you go… No, I am not hungry, take it away. Nosherwan, you're sitting here 
burdened with worries, while Dua is out there meeting Sarfaraz and planning to marry him. She has no regard for your honor. Before she humiliates you in court, divorce her and be done with it. I don’t want someone to degrade you. Who gives you all this information? I keep an eye on her. I don't want any more harm to come to you. We have to keep an eye on things. I can look after what is good 
or bad for me, myself. You don't need to worry about me. Okay. As you see fit. Have food. No, I am not hungry, take it away. And in the future, you will not do 
anything against my will. Leave from here. Everyone says that 
she has cheated on me. She is unfaithful. Your reports also say that 
she is meeting with Sarfaraz. But, I don’t know why 
my heart doesn’t accept it. What do you think? Can she ever cheat me? What can I say about this, Sir? You can think better. Jaffar, she has never seemed a sinner to me. My heart doesn’t accept that 
she can ever give me poison. No matter what happens, she cannot take my life. She can never take it. Sir, if you think that 
she is not unfaithful, then who knows, maybe your heart is testifying the truth. Papa, did you call me? Yes, I called you. What is it that I hear? I don’t know what information 
has been given to you. Did you go to meet Sarfaraz? Yes, I did. What do you want to prove, child? Huh? Do you want to prove what the entire world
is saying about you to be true? Your sister, Nosherwan, Sarfaraz, everyone is talking against you. Is it true? Papa, just because someone accuses me 
doesn't make me guilty. I did what I thought was right. Look child, talk openly. What’s the reason behind meeting another
man while you have a husband? He was coming in my way again and again, and then he had said that he divorced Fiza because of me. So, it was necessary to ask him 
how much truth is there in it. Do you see her stubbornness? She has become so shameless, that she is admitting in front of you
that she met Sarfaraz. Fiza, you are in no relationship with him. So, why are you getting upset 
with me talking about this? Because our relationship ended 
because of you. Today, I’m facing this situation 
because of you. You have not been happy
with him since day one. His behavior towards you 
was bad since day one, and then you wanted to get 
a divorce from him, yourself. If he divorced you, then why are you getting 
angry with me? Okay, enough. Enough. Enough. 
Enough. Enough. Enough. Dua, you will never meet 
Sarfaraz again after today. End of story. I will have an open conversation 
with your husband. Now, go home. Stay there. I can’t tolerate these daily dramas anymore. Leave from here. Sure. Instead of dragging her out of the home, 
you are letting her go inside. I am telling you, Papa, if she lives here, 
then I will not stay here. I cannot tolerate her existence now.
