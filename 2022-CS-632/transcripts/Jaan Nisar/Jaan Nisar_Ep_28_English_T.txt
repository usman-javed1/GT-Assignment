[26.04] Hey, you are back.
[28.96] Yes, I had come.
[31.80] Did you come from your shopping?
[33.40] Yes.
[34.56] I didn’t feel like it at all.
[36.80] But since it was your order,
[38.60] so I had to go.
[40.12] You did good,
[42.04] after all, you would 
have gotten bored alone.
[45.60] I can wait for you.
[48.60] I know.
[55.60] What happened?
[57.76] Is everything okay?
[60.12] Hmm?
[63.24] You are hiding
 something from me.
[66.40] No, what will I hide from you?
[69.52] Why do you feel this way?
[72.56] I don’t know.
[74.92] But, I feel like
[77.76] you are caught in some worry.
[81.96] A man doesn’t forget 
his first love so easily.
[93.88] There is nothing like that.
[96.24] Show me what you shopped for.
[99.72] It is in the car,
[101.64] the driver must be bringing it.
[103.08] Hmmm.
[107.76] You are happy with me, right?
[116.04] I am really happy.
[119.72] This shopping, money,
[123.00] all this doesn’t matter.
[126.92] I just want your companionship,
[130.04] your time.
[134.36] All my time is for you.
[142.20] But, still, if you have a complaint,
[145.56] then come on, 
let’s go watch a movie.
[147.20] You are ready, right?
[148.96] Right now?
[150.68] Yes.
[151.16] No. No. You just came.
[154.60] You must be tired.
[155.72] What difference does it make?
[156.56] I will have a cup of tea,
 and I will be fresh.
[158.44] You are ready, right?
 I am coming.
[159.60] No, leave it.
[163.92] Some other time.
[165.48] Why some other time?
[168.64] You get ready, I am coming.
[203.08] Mama, have food.
[208.80] I am not hungry.
[211.48] You have not eaten 
anything all day long.
[213.48] Eat a little.
[220.00] My Dua was right 
in front of my eyes,
[223.48] I couldn’t even meet her.
[227.88] This thing has made 
me lose my appetite.
[240.12] Greetings, Papa.
[243.12] Greetings.
[249.96] What are you crying 
about early in the morning?
[252.40] What are you crying about?
[254.28] Mr. Aslam,
[255.60] I saw Dua.
[256.88] She was in a big car.
[258.40] I told you
[260.12] not to mention that 
wretched girl's name in this house.
[263.36] Can't your small
 mind understand this?
[266.68] How do I not take her name?
[269.52] How do I not take her name?
[272.96] One can be patient 
about the dead,
[275.60] but not with the ones living.
[277.80] For us, she died the day
[280.60] she crossed the doorstep.
[282.96] Mr. Aslam,
[285.04] I think she is in a difficulty.
[289.48] She had another car with her,
 which had gunmen in it.
[294.08] Yes,
[295.92] this is the fate of 
such wayward girls.
[298.44] Mr. Aslam,
[300.00] Dua is your biological daughter.
[302.24] How can your heart turn 
to stone towards her?
[304.88] Fehmida,
[307.04] my tone is harsh right now.
[308.96] The disgrace
 she smeared on my face,
[311.76] even if I kill her,
 it won't be enough.
[314.40] Mr. Aslam,
[316.08] I beg you. For God’s sake.
[320.32] For God’s sake, 
do something for Dua.
[322.84] You give the sake 
of God for the living.
[326.20] For the dead,
[327.32] there is a shroud 
of flowers, Fehmida.
[332.76] A shroud of flowers.
[337.36] Oh God. Oh God, have mercy.
[341.08] Who do I ask for help 
for my daughter?
[345.28] Mama, get a grip on yourself.
[358.84] Hello.
[360.44] Yes,
[361.20] send two to four to the room.
[364.12] Thank you.
[414.84] Hello.
[418.36] Your voice has already 
given up on you, Dua.
[421.72] After knowing the truth,
[423.04] the ground beneath 
your feet will slip away.
[428.36] What is the meaning of 
sending me these pictures?
[430.72] I have called to explain
 the meaning to you, Dua.
[435.40] I don’t want to hear
 anything from you.
[437.12] You will have to hear me.
[441.24] But before that,
[442.84] take the support 
of something heavy.
[449.72] What if you fall on your face
 after finding out the truth?
[455.56] Nosherwan has 
told me everything
[458.20] about the circumstances 
you got married to him.
[462.56] So, that’s why,
[464.16] there is no need to 
provoke me against him.
[468.08] Your Nosherwan told you
[470.80] under what circumstances
 he married me,
[474.04] but did your Nosherwan tell you,
[476.96] who Farah is?
[481.92] I told you,
[483.92] I won't be influenced 
by anything you say.
[486.08] No, no, don't listen to me,
[488.64] that's fine.
[490.08] But at least ask your Nosherwan
[493.56] who this Farah is after all.
[502.56] What did you think?
[504.32] Are you the first one
[505.96] who Nosherwan’s 
heart has liked?
[514.96] You have no idea that
[516.52] Nosherwan used to 
love Farah like crazy.
[528.96] And when Farah is 
no longer there, then,
[531.72] how can you always remain,
[533.68] huh?
[537.96] It would be better 
that you understand,
[539.80] that Nosherwan
[541.28] loves Farah more than you.
[550.96] And you know,
[553.40] a man doesn’t forget his 
first love so easily.
[602.88] You are hiding
 something from me.
[606.08] No, what will I hide from you?
[609.16] why do you feel this way?
[612.16] I don’t know.
[614.36] But, I feel like
[617.40] you are caught in some worry.
[622.00] There is nothing like that.
[625.60] It would be better 
that you understand,
[627.60] that Nosherwan
[629.00] loves Farah more than you.
[645.64] What happened? 
You are not ready.
[647.64] I will just get ready.
[650.00] Okay, then we will 
leave after having tea.
[652.68] Sure.
[674.88] If it is an important call, 
then answer it.
[680.40] Yes, excuse me.
[688.72] Hello.
[690.24] Hello.
[692.04] Ghaznavi, where are you?
[693.08] Why?
[694.52] What will be 
the answer to this why?
[697.72] I want to meet you.
[699.00] Sorry, I am busy right now.
[702.12] You will have to 
take out time for me.
[704.16] I really want to see you now.
[705.32] Are you getting…
[705.64] I cannot meet you right now.
[710.60] How…
[723.68] I wanted to meet you 
to congratulate you, but
[726.64] I am sorry to hear it.
[730.04] What can we do?
[732.32] They belonged to God, 
He took them back.
[734.92] Yes, you are right.
[738.76] Take care of sister-in-law,
[740.24] she must be really sad.
[742.08] Yes, so I am taking care of her.
[743.16] What else do I do?
[745.64] You still haven’t forgotten it?
[747.16] When does your sister-in-law,
 let me forget it?
[752.00] She starts praising her sister.
[755.00] How do I forget?
[757.56] If someday, someone 
finds out, then?
[761.44] It is difficult for 
anyone to find out.
[763.64] The father doesn’t let them 
take the name of the daughter,
[765.96] and here, 
I am also strict with Fiza.
[768.76] But, buddy, 
still, it is a blood relation.
[770.88] They will come face
 to face someday.
[772.52] Yes, so we will deal with it, then.
[774.52] Why are you boring me with this?
[777.48] Okay, Brother. 
I won't ask you.
[778.88] Tell me, how is your job going?
[780.88] The job is fine.
[782.96] You are not really satisfied.
[785.24] Yes, so how can 
I be satisfied, Brother?
[787.32] I work the entire month and
[789.32] I get a few thousand at
 the end of the month.
[794.96] You know, I want to become
 a millionaire, and
[797.92] I cannot do that with this job.
[800.44] Then think of something else.
[804.28] That’s what I am thinking.
[806.40] I am trying to get the number 
of the boss’ wife somehow.
[812.48] Then you'll see,
[813.24] I'll turn this job from 
thousands to millions.
[820.96] Meaning?
[825.40] Drink tea, then I will explain
 this shortcut to you.
[828.28] Drink it.
[843.36] Why do I feel that
[844.32] you are not with me,
 even after being with me?
[847.88] Why do you feel this way?
[850.64] I felt it, so I said it.
[853.44] No, there is nothing like that.
[856.68] Then what is the matter?
[860.80] It is your imagination
 and nothing else.
[864.00] This has never 
happened before today,
[866.60] that you are with me,
[867.64] but you are lost somewhere else.
[873.08] There is nothing like 
that even today.
[875.48] It is possible that I may have 
zoned out for a little while.
[880.20] Why even for a little while?
[883.72] This means you want me
 to always think about you.
[888.68] Do I want something wrong?
[891.32] Not at all.
[893.36] Then?
[897.12] Then this, that all
 my attention is towards you.
[904.40] You won’t ever change, right?
[909.24] Do I seem like someone 
who would change to you?
[915.92] I don’t know,
[918.60] but now I have
 started to be afraid.
[922.20] When I am with you, then
[924.40] what are you afraid of?
[940.52] Please, have it.
[976.44] Are you happy now?
[978.96] I canceled all 
my engagements today,
[980.96] and I am with you all day.
[984.84] I am very happy.
[988.52] I am planning to go to Europe.
[991.88] I find one engagement
 or another here.
[995.88] Will you come with me?
[1001.96] With you?
[1004.24] Anywhere.
[1008.00] I know you and
[1010.44] your heart as well.
[1030.20] What happened?
[1031.80] Huh?
[1034.28] Check.
[1034.84] It may be an important call.
[1040.88] Hello.
[1042.08] Hello.
[1043.24] Ghaznavi, where are you?
[1045.40] I am really unwell.
[1048.56] Can you please come to my home?
[1055.04] No.
[1058.32] Ghaznavi, I have no one
 who is my own here.
[1061.00] That’s why
[1061.76] I am requesting you. Please.
[1063.32] Please try to understand.
[1066.12] I am busy.
[1068.92] If my condition stays
 like this for long,
[1071.44] I won’t be able to survive.
[1078.20] If not for me, then come
 for the sake of humanity.
[1082.48] I am sending you the location pin.
[1085.60] If I die before you come, then
[1091.00] I forgive you for my murder.
[1108.48] You will have to come.
[1115.52] If I die before you come, then
[1118.96] I forgive you for my murder.
[1121.44] Something important has come up.
[1122.60] I will have to go.
[1125.48] But you had said that
[1126.44] you are with me all day, today.
[1129.36] I will come back soon.
[1135.08] Listen.
[1137.40] I will wait.
[1236.96] Look, I know
[1238.48] you have been really 
hurt because of me
[1240.44] and I am also regretting it a lot.
[1245.00] But Fiza, don’t worry.
[1248.12] I am with you.
[1250.88] God will give us another child,
[1254.76] and this time, I promise,
[1257.96] I will care for you a lot.
[1266.76] Did you want me 
to do something?
[1268.56] You are asking me if 
I wanted something as
[1270.92] if the entire household 
rests on your shoulders.
[1274.44] You don’t bother to
 step out of the room.
[1277.08] The household chores 
mean nothing to you.
[1278.96] You should put
 in some effort too.
[1280.88] You’re always
 resting on the bed.
[1282.76] How long will Sumbul and
 I manage the household chores?
[1285.84] Do you have any
 responsibilities or not?
[1289.48] You tell me,
[1290.24] what needs to be done?
[1291.36] If you step out of the bed, 
then I will tell you.
[1296.40] I had a little weakness,
[1300.40] that’s why I…
[1301.24] Hey, are you a special girl?
[1305.88] Thousands of girls in
 the world go through all this,
[1308.72] so do they get bedridden like this?
[1311.52] And if the doctor just 
asks the girls to do bed rest,
[1315.36] that’s it,
[1316.44] they attach themselves to the bed.
[1319.60] These doctors themselves are lazy,
[1322.20] like you.
[1323.40] But that’s it. it is enough.
[1324.84] Sumbul and
 I have worked enough.
[1326.48] This won’t work anymore.
[1327.84] Go show this pride and 
tantrums to your parents.
[1331.72] Don’t show them in my house.
[1333.24] Understand?
[1334.04] Now, enough… come on.
[1335.68] Come on, do the household chores.
[1337.00] Get up.
[1401.40] I thought you wouldn’t come.
[1404.72] You referred to humanity 
and made me helpless.
[1410.56] Are you reminding me that
[1411.48] you don’t love me?
[1417.24] How long have you 
been in this condition?
[1420.88] Since, yesterday.
[1423.12] Did you go to a doctor?
[1431.80] I will call them.
[1433.08] No,
[1435.80] there is no need to call them.
[1438.04] I have the medication.
[1440.88] If you have the medication,
[1442.08] then why are you not taking it?
[1444.08] I don’t feel like it.
[1447.80] I don’t want to live.
[1451.12] After Mama and
 Papa’s departure,
[1453.40] I have become completely alone.
[1457.40] Hmmm.
[1458.04] Where is it?
[1462.20] It is kept there.
[1479.64] My heart doesn’t feel 
like having medicine.
[1482.76] When has anyone benefited 
from listening to their heart,
[1485.92] that you will?
[1498.92] Here you go.
[1500.08] I don’t want to have it.
[1501.68] Farah, what is this 
childish behavior?
[1503.04] Why are you being stubborn?
[1504.04] Come on.
[1508.36] Even today, 
when I don’t listen to you,
[1510.36] you react just like before.
[1514.84] Here you go.
[1517.16] Come on.
[1521.04] If you even give poison with 
your hands with so much love,
[1523.00] they will also take it.
[1528.24] Since when did you
 become a heart patient?
[1532.52] Since I got separated from you.
[1547.00] I think you should rest.
[1547.96] I will go now.
[1553.68] Ghaznavi.
[1562.00] Marry me.
[1569.56] Please.
[1570.72] Please, try to understand.
[1572.28] I cannot live without you.
[1574.60] Please, try to understand.
[1577.88] You know how much I love you.
[1581.56] Please.
[1584.40] Please, say something.
[1587.72] Please, marry me.
[1646.12] Are you happy now?
[1647.40] I canceled all my engagements today,
[1649.44] and I am with you all day.
[1651.36] I am planning to go to Europe.
[1654.04] Will you come with me?
[1660.16] With you?
[1662.56] Anywhere.
[1666.36] I know you and
[1668.76] your heart as well.
[1673.76] Something important has come up.
[1675.04] I will have to go.
[1676.84] But you had said that
[1677.84] you are with me all day, today.
[1681.56] I will come back soon.
[1685.24] A man doesn’t forget
 his first love so easily.
[1769.60] Yes?
[1771.20] Hey,
[1773.36] your voice has completely given up 
on you trying to understand your status.
[1779.68] You’re not even capable 
of saying anything, are you?
[1783.00] Why have you called?
[1784.96] Check Nosherwan’s
 current location.
[1788.04] He is at Farah’s flat right now.
[1790.20] And if you don’t 
believe me, then
[1793.76] call Nosherwan and 
ask him where he is.
[1796.80] Why would I do this
[1799.40] when your spies 
are there to do it?
[1806.16] But, I am surprised,
[1808.52] where were your spies when Ghaznavi
 was getting married to me?
[1817.60] I didn’t have an idea at that time,
[1820.24] that Nosherwan would do this.
[1822.28] Or else, I would have done what 
I am doing today, at that time
[1825.16] and you wouldn’t have been 
standing on equal footing with me as a co-wife.
[1831.16] Can I ask you what you 
will get now doing all this?
[1835.96] You can surely ask me.
[1838.64] The way you are ruling 
over Nosherwan’s heart,
[1842.04] I’ll kick you out of there.
[1844.44] It will give me peace.
[1845.88] A lot of peace.
[1847.56] Okay,
[1849.12] for a moment, let’s assume
[1852.48] that after Farah comes,
[1854.28] Ghaznavi will leave me.
[1858.64] But have you
 ever thought that
[1861.72] even after that,
[1863.72] there will be no place for
 you in Ghaznavi’s heart?
[1866.64] Hey come on,
[1868.24] thousands like you and
[1869.64] Farah come and go.
[1872.68] I am there forever.
[1874.40] And don’t forget that
[1876.28] I am talking to you sitting at 
the mansion of Nosherwan’s parents.
[1880.52] What importance 
does that mansion hold,
[1883.40] where you have nothing 
else but loneliness?
[1995.64] It is really late now.
[1999.28] Time has stopped right 
where we both parted ways.
[2004.44] There’s no benefit 
in all this, please.
[2007.56] You look at the benefit or loss.
[2012.20] I just love you.
[2014.96] Dua must be waiting 
for me, I will go.
[2016.92] And me?
[2020.12] What about me?
[2022.20] What about my wait?
[2024.24] Is this how you are
 repaying me for my wait?
[2025.84] You had changed
 your path, not me.
[2029.12] Had you not left me 
and gone at that time,
[2030.96] then you wouldn’t have been 
complaining in front of me like this.
[2033.88] I made a mistake.
[2036.00] You can punish
 me however you want,
[2038.84] but don’t look away from me.
[2040.96] Punishment?
[2044.48] You had punished me,
[2048.04] with loneliness and solitude.
[2052.16] You didn’t think about me,
 even for a moment,
[2055.08] how I came to you to escape 
the blackmailing of my own family,
[2059.80] and you just left me like that.
[2061.84] You didn’t even look back to see
[2062.64] what I was going through.
[2063.60] Do you have any idea
[2066.16] how I endured that phase?
[2069.44] Let’s get married.
[2072.32] We will live happily.
[2074.80] After Mama and Papa’s departure,
[2076.20] I have become completely alone.
[2077.64] Please.
[2079.12] Please forgive me.
[2081.24] I beg you. Please.
[2082.88] Please, forgive me.
[2084.00] I forgave you.
[2085.40] You just forgive me now.
[2087.68] I am married.
[2092.96] Please don’t contact me now.
[2095.44] Ghaznavi.
[2097.36] Ghaznavi, I will contact you.
[2100.80] Not once.
