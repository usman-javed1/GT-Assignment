[27.00] Thank you.
[30.00] Did you feel happy meeting your sister?
[36.64] Okay, let’s do one thing.
[37.36] I will also go with you tomorrow,
[39.24] we will go meet your sister.
[42.20] But,
[44.20] she didn’t give me her address.
[47.92] So, when is difficult to find the address?
[51.60] Yes.
[53.52] But,
[54.64] can you find out the address?
[59.00] Yes,
[60.60] if you ask me,
[61.32] it will take me two minutes to get it.
[64.00] Okay.
[67.52] Let’s go to her place, tomorrow.
[70.00] In fact, do one thing,
[70.84] don’t inform her.
[71.40] We will surprise her.
[73.88] In fact,
[74.36] she gave you her phone number, right?
[77.04] Yes.
[78.68] I have her number.
[80.24] But she said 
she would contact me herself.
[84.04] So, no issue,
[84.76] you call her first.
[86.32] It makes no difference.
[88.72] Okay no,
[89.72] don’t call.
[91.08] We will go to meet her directly.
[95.88] No,
[96.80] I think it will not look good like this.
[99.60] First, let me talk to her.
[101.92] We will plan something and then go.
[105.44] Fine, as you wish.
[142.64] Fiza.
[144.12] Fiza.
[146.12] You are here?
[154.36] You didn’t call, that’s why.
[157.16] Call? I…
[161.68] What happened?
[164.20] Is there a problem?
[165.64] You have an idea
about her worries, right?
[171.12] This world and its fears don't
even let us breathe freely.
[176.04] My in-laws,
[178.76] Papa.
[183.12] Dua,
[185.52] please forgive me.
[187.72] You know, after you went missing,
[189.60] we were very worried.
[193.04] But now,
[194.76] seeing you so happy like
this in your life, you know,
[200.24] we can only pray for you, but
[202.04] we cannot meet you, Dua.
[203.64] We cannot meet you.
[209.68] Will we stop living out
of the fear of people, or
[215.68] will we stop our own?
[218.80] I am helpless, Dua.
[220.84] I am really helpless.
[227.96] Fine.
[231.32] If it is so, then I will not force you.
[236.88] But, can you do me a favor?
[241.80] Make me meet Mama once, man.
[245.64] If…if…
[248.16] if she doesn’t want to meet me,
[250.32] then I will never show
you people my face.
[252.64] I swear,
[253.24] I will never show you my face.
[254.24] But once…
[256.16] please, make me
meet Mama and Sania once.
[259.68] Please.
[262.60] Fine, I will do something.
[300.36] Come quickly, Mama,
[304.52] Sania.
[306.48] Hey, Fiza,
[308.36] child, you should
have said no to Dua.
[311.40] I tried, but
[312.92] she just wants to meet
you once, meet her.
[314.88] What is the point of talking now?
[316.32] Come on.
[317.36] What times have come,
[319.60] we have to meet our
own daughter like a thief.
[328.64] Mama, come quickly.
[330.36] What if Papa comes?
[331.48] Yes, that’s why
I am calling out to you.
[332.64] Come quickly.
[343.20] Where are you people going?
[344.64] Where are you going?
[345.84] And you.
[347.60] Did I not tell you not to come here?
[350.12] Where are you taking
your mother and sister?
[352.04] We…
[353.00] We were going to the doctor.
[355.64] Sania was not well.
[358.04] Really?
[358.80] Then why did you
not go yourself?
[360.08] Why did you call her?
[361.28] She will go to her in-laws
home from there,
[363.20] and we will visit the doctor.
[365.24] Okay.
[366.52] Okay fine, come soon.
[367.72] Sure.
[368.12] Yes.
[368.84] Come on, give it.
Give me the keys.
[370.92] Come on.
[377.48] Cover your face.
[379.56] Yes.
[380.20] And you, Sania.
[382.00] Lower your gaze and go.
[394.96] Dua.
[395.72] Mama.
[425.80] Where did you go leaving all of us?
[429.32] I made a mistake.
[432.28] A really big mistake.
[443.00] I made a mistake.
[445.80] I had strayed from
the path you showed me,
[451.52] so all this was bound
to happen to me.
[457.00] There is no point in crying
and cribbing now, child.
[460.56] Who was that damned person?
[465.88] Whoever he was,
[468.64] he just wanted to ruin me,
[474.00] and did so too,
[476.56] but God had something else planned.
[480.36] He saved me.
[487.44] Ghaznavi is really good.
[490.04] He also cares for me a lot.
[492.16] You got married
[493.12] and we couldn’t even
come to your wedding.
[495.40] Alright,
[496.28] I will take your
complaint to Ghaznavi,
[498.60] then we will see what he says.
[501.00] No, there is no need
to talk about this.
[504.48] He gave you respect,
[506.32] he married you,
[508.84] My burning heart is
finally finding some relief.
[512.60] May God protect you
from the evil eye.
[515.36] May He give you a lot of happiness.
[520.68] You know, I had everything.
[524.28] Only your prayers were lacking.
[530.16] Thank you, Fiza.
[551.80] I am so, so, so happy today,
[554.52] that I cannot tell you.
[556.88] There is no need to tell me.
[561.60] I can read your face.
[565.80] I know.
[567.36] I am really expressive, right?
[570.16] I cannot hide anything.
[571.04] Everything comes to
the face itself.
[574.40] The truth always comes on the faces
of honest and straightforward people.
[580.32] That’s why I love you.
[588.92] When are you making me
meet your Mama and sisters?
[594.56] I won't be able to do that.
[597.12] Papa’s anger is really bad.
[599.88] If he finds out,
[600.96] it will be really bad.
[603.24] Hmmm.
[605.32] So, first, introduce me
to your Papa.
[608.08] It is possible his thinking
will change after meeting me.
[610.80] No. No.
[612.80] if you meet him, then
[615.64] he will also consider you
responsible for my mistake.
[619.32] He will say something
for no reason,
[621.20] I don’t want that.
[623.40] No issue. I will hear it.
[628.88] I can do anything for you.
[633.52] But, Mama and Sania…
[638.00] you know,
[639.00] Fiza is married,
[641.44] but God knows what he will
do with Mama and Sania.
[646.64] I cannot do this.
[651.60] Hmmm.
[653.76] If this is the case that
we cannot go there,
[655.48] and we cannot meet
them there, then
[659.08] invite them here.
[662.68] What?
[664.72] Really?
[667.52] Can I invite them here?
[669.68] Of course,
[670.92] it is your own home.
[671.72] You can invite whoever
you want here.
[673.72] Who will stop you?
[681.80] Thank you.
[683.44] You are always welcome.
[753.44] Sir, I want two…
[754.56] No, it won’t be possible today.
[778.56] Hey man, he is such
an arrogant man.
[780.80] What was this?
[783.36] I will have to do
something to be noticed.
[786.24] No matter how
much you bow down,
[788.12] people like him will never notice us.
[791.04] That is not true.
[793.44] You will see,
[795.68] one day he will remember
my name well.
[797.92] It will take some time for
that moment to arrive.
[800.60] Right now go
[801.44] and do your work.
[805.64] Do your work.
[822.84] Yes.
[825.64] Sir, we are constantly getting
calls from the Zani group for a meeting.
[831.36] Fine, you give them
time for tomorrow.
[833.24] Okay, sure, sir.
[843.76] You're humiliating me
for that cheap girl.
[847.04] Everyone knows where
you brought her from.
[849.40] Don’t you dare.
[851.48] if you speak a little
nonsense about Dua,
[854.44] then I will forget that
[855.32] I have ever had
a relationship with you.
[858.20] You have made her stand
right next to me.
[861.48] You will have to hear it.
[863.20] I am making you
understand for the last time,
[866.12] stay away from me.
[868.12] And I too have told you,
[870.24] I have lost you once,
[871.68] I cannot lose you again.
[873.32] I love you.
[891.84] We will surely come to your home.
[893.64] I really want to see sister’s home,
[896.16] where you are
living like Cinderella.
[899.08] You come and stay
over at my home.
[900.88] Really?
[901.48] Yes. Yes.
[902.40] There is no need.
[905.00] You stay happy.
[906.88] And then we met you yesterday,
[909.08] we even met today, and
[910.20] we will continue to meet you like this.
[911.80] We are happy about this.
[914.08] But, why Mama?
[915.56] Child, you know your Papa.
[922.44] Mama is right, Dua.
[925.00] All of us have forgiven
you with our hearts.
[932.08] But this world is not
ready to forgive you,
[935.52] and Papa and my in-laws
top that list.
[950.64] After all that I went through,
[953.64] why are these people
doing this with me?
[956.04] That’s how you think,
[957.88] these earthly gods
don’t think this way.
[964.56] Mama,
[965.60] will you stop meeting me
because of the fear of society?
[968.92] How will I spend such a big
life without you people?
[974.16] Child, we too are helpless.
[977.28] You…
[978.16] you don’t worry about Papa.
[979.68] I will convince Papa.
[982.12] If not sooner,
than later, he will agree.
[987.68] Papa.
[989.32] Papa?
[1008.88] Mama, come on.
[1009.92] Let’s go home, child.
[1011.72] We will have to go home, Dua.
[1021.92] When I have told you not to,
[1022.92] then why are you calling
me again and again?
[1025.96] What do you want to make me
understand by ignoring my call?
[1028.60] That I don’t want to talk to you.
[1030.80] Okay.
[1031.96] Can I ask you the reason?
[1034.92] I don't want to have any
ties with you anymore.
[1036.32] Whatever was between
us in the past,
[1037.88] it's over now.
[1038.60] Why don’t you understand?
[1041.04] That’s how you feel, but not me.
[1044.44] You know, doing this
[1045.36] you are only wasting your and my time.
[1046.96] That’s it.
[1048.00] Right now, I am just
wasting time, Ghaznavi.
[1051.36] But if you don’t come
here in half an hour,
[1054.36] then I will come to your office,
[1056.20] and not just that,
[1057.76] after that,
[1058.32] I will go to your home and meet Dua.
[1066.32] And this time I will not come back silently.
[1069.32] Do you get it?
[1071.68] I am waiting for you.
[1089.36] Jaffar.
[1152.20] What is the purpose of calling me
like this through blackmail?
[1155.96] You find my love to be blackmailing?
[1157.48] It is nothing less than that either.
[1160.00] Why don’t you understand me?
[1162.04] I cannot live without you, Ghaznavi.
[1163.76] I only belong to Dua.
[1165.40] You don’t understand this.
[1167.36] See,
[1168.48] I will also accept Dua.
[1171.48] Please.
[1172.16] Please, just accept me once.
[1173.76] It is not possible now.
[1175.12] How is it not possible?
[1176.76] Who can restrain you?
[1179.16] I have put this restraint on myself.
[1183.64] See yourself,
[1184.80] you know,
[1185.88] I love you so much.
[1187.56] The two of us will live really
happily with each other.
[1189.68] I made a big mistake coming here.
[1191.72] I should leave.
[1192.64] You cannot go from here.
[1197.72] Leave me.
[1198.72] Fine.
[1200.32] If you leave me and go today,
[1201.96] then you will have to come to carry
my corpse on your shoulders.
[1219.96] Farah, have you gone mad?
[1222.00] What did you do?
[1223.92] Farah. Farah,
[1225.28] Farah, listen to me.
[1227.20] Farah, open your eyes.
[1228.20] I had told you,
[1230.64] if I don’t get you, I will die.
[1233.96] Farah, what is this madness?
[1235.80] Farah, open your eyes.
[1236.60] Farah, open your eyes.
[1237.36] Open your eyes.
[1239.96] What is this madness, Farah?
[1241.68] Is someone here?
[1243.96] Farah.
[1245.00] Farah, open your eyes.
[1296.60] What game are you mother and
daughters playing under my nose?
[1309.44] What is going on here?
[1311.64] I had told you not to meet her.
[1314.68] I had to tell you, that…
[1318.80] When did you have to tell me?
[1320.48] After my death?
[1322.16] You cannot treat Mama like this.
[1324.24] You be quiet.
[1325.72] All this happened because of you.
[1327.28] You come here all the time.
[1328.52] Go to your home.
[1331.72] And you?
[1332.64] When I told you that no
one would meet that girl,
[1335.40] then how did you meet?
[1338.88] Fehmida Begum, you forgot
[1340.92] what I had told you.
[1342.52] I had told you, if you meet her,
[1344.00] then I…
[1344.64] For God’s sake.
[1346.48] For God’s sake,
[1348.16] care for my age a little.
[1351.40] You didn’t do good, going
against my decision.
[1355.32] You will have to suffer
the punishment for it.
[1357.08] Mr. Aslam, why do you forget?
[1359.68] Why do you forget that
[1360.88] I am also a mother?
[1362.00] If you’re a mother,
remain a mother.
[1364.24] Because you couldn’t
fulfill the role of a wife.
[1367.64] There is no place for
you in this home,
[1369.52] Fehmida Begum.
[1371.76] Fehmida Begum,
[1373.72] I divorce…
[1374.44] Papa, come to your senses,
what are you doing?
[1375.60] Be quiet.
[1376.24] Mama, go inside.
[1377.60] Mama, go inside. Come on.
[1379.00] Fehmida Begum.
[1381.20] Who is it?
[1391.60] You?
[1392.80] What are you doing here?
[1400.96] I came to tell you that
[1403.88] don’t say anything to, Mama.
[1406.12] I was the one who
insisted on meeting her.
[1408.20] Who are you to tell me this?
[1409.80] She is my wife.
[1411.08] I can do anything I want.
[1412.24] Get lost from here.
[1413.04] I am your daughter,
[1416.24] and you cannot even deny this
relationship after you die.
[1419.36] You are not my daughter.
[1421.32] A wayward girl like you can
never be my daughter.
[1426.04] Madam has said
[1427.28] that she has come to
meet her mother,
[1429.04] so she will meet her and go.
[1438.04] Neither can you close the
door on my face today
[1440.60] nor drag me out.
[1454.68] You had dragged me out of here,
out of the fear of these people, right?
[1466.08] You closed the door on my face.
[1479.84] Today, does anyone
have the courage
[1482.52] to raise a finger at me?
[1486.68] Does anyone have the
courage to come in front of me?
[1499.48] None of them dare to raise
fingers at me, Papa.
[1507.48] She is my mother.
[1510.12] My mother and my sisters live here.
[1514.64] Not once,
[1516.00] I will come here again and again,
[1522.48] and no one will have
the courage to stop me.
[1533.68] And if you ever mistreat them again,
[1539.72] I swear, I swear to God, Papa,
[1550.72] I won’t spare you either.
[1578.64] Is there a spectacle going on here?
[1585.52] Go do your work.
[1595.00] Please try to understand,
[1596.04] I cannot live without you.
[1599.08] Please try to understand.
[1602.08] You know how much I love you.
[1605.80] Please.
[1608.68] Please, say something.
[1612.00] Please, marry me.
[1636.36] You find my love to be blackmailing?
[1637.96] It is nothing less than that either.
[1639.24] Why don’t you understand me?
[1641.24] I cannot live without you, Ghaznavi.
[1642.92] I only belong to Dua.
[1644.48] You don’t understand this.
[1646.52] See, I will also accept Dua.
[1650.52] Please.
[1651.36] Please, just accept me once.
[1652.92] It is not possible now.
[1654.32] How is it not possible?
[1655.92] Who can restrain you?
[1664.60] Mama. My beloved
Mama, stop now.
[1667.88] Why are you crying now, Mama?
[1669.48] You should be happy now.
[1671.08] See, even sister is with us.
[1672.76] The little one is absolutely right.
[1674.48] What is there to cry about now?
[1678.12] Take out whatever fear you
have for Papa in your heart.
[1682.68] He will not say
anything to you now.
[1686.60] What was the need for you
to argue with your father?
[1690.68] I have not argued.
[1693.28] He wanted a son,
[1696.08] I have shown that I can be a son.
[1699.36] You silenced Papa.
[1702.60] You have become really brave, sister.
[1708.48] I…I…I am really afraid of Mr. Aslam’s silence.
[1714.04] The one who has supported you this far
[1716.76] will continue to do so in the future as well.
[1718.96] Listen to me.
[1721.60] Whatever fear you have in your heart,
[1723.68] take it out.
[1727.96] You don’t need to
be afraid of anyone,
[1730.24] because your daughters
are standing with you.
[1732.48] No one can say anything to you.
[1734.40] No. No. No. Mama. Mama.
[1736.56] Tell her…
[1737.12] No.
[1737.68] And if you fear that
Papa will divorce you,
[1741.92] or he will say something
like this to you,
[1743.48] then you don’t need to be afraid.
[1746.52] Don’t be afraid of anyone.
[1749.96] We are all with you, Mama.
[1751.48] We are all with you.
[1752.48] Your daughters are with you.
[1755.96] A weak man only has one weapon
[1758.60] that he uses on his wife.
[1767.80] Listen,
[1769.20] I have a headache.
[1770.72] Won’t you get me tea?
[1774.56] And if there are biscuits,
[1776.32] then bring them too.
[1777.40] I will just bring it.
[1778.20] Will you have tea?
[1779.48] Will you have tea?
[1780.64] Will you have tea?
[1781.28] Dua is here,
[1782.24] we will drink it happily with her.
[1783.56] Right?
[1841.12] Now you people have an idea, right?
[1844.12] Sir, we didn’t know this
was Mr. Ghaznavi’s matter.
[1846.72] Had we known,
we wouldn’t have come.
[1848.48] The hospital called that it
was a matter of suicide.
[1851.68] That’s why we came.
[1853.16] Hmm.
[1854.04] You know now, right?
[1855.32] Yes, absolutely.
[1856.52] Please.
[1870.84] Doctor, how is she now?
[1872.80] She is fine now.
[1874.32] Thank you.
[1881.68] She is fine now.
[1885.88] This news shouldn’t reach your Madam.
[1890.52] It won’t, sir.
[1960.64] Dua....
[1974.56] After fifteen days,
[1976.00] our Fiza will go to her home.
[1978.04] Hey, they are such good people,
[1979.52] they have also given sweets.
[1980.60] And our Fiza is pretty, right?
[1982.00] There is no doubt about this.
[1983.28] Sister is really pretty.
[1984.92] Okay,
[1985.80] on this note, have some sweets.
[1988.08] Yes. Yes.
[1989.28] But how will we make
preparations so soon?
[1991.84] Man, please don’t scare me.
[1993.40] I also have to get
my clothes stitched.
[2059.24] Dua, you are not new in this home.
[2062.24] When you are aware of
Papa’s temperament.
[2064.76] So don’t give him
a chance like that.
[2067.08] He just wants an opportunity
[2068.60] to remind Mom of everything,
past and present.
[2071.56] Okay, I will be careful.
[2074.60] Listen,
[2075.84] come with me to Mama.
[2077.80] Put in a little request, please.
[2079.92] Come.
[2080.96] Love.
