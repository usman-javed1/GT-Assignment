There is nothing to worry about. This is good news. What do you mean? She is pregnant, and you are going to be a father. I will prescribe some medication, you just give it to her on time. And a healthy child will
be added to your family. I will take your leave now. Take care of yourself. If you don’t mind, then please leave us alone for a while. Yes. Absolutely. I will leave. But, tell me, who do I need to congratulate? You, Nosherwan Saeein, or Sarfaraz? What nonsense is this? I am talking nonsense? He was saying that… What was he saying? Dua, I had heard both of you talk. Now, I don’t understand
what I should say. Still, this is a personal
matter between you two, I shouldn't be getting involved. Excuse me. Now Dua is going to
give Nosherwan an heir. How will I remove her from
Nosherwan's life now? Even after receiving such
a big happiness, Ghaznavi didn't say a word to me. Why has Ghaznavi become restless
instead of happy after hearing this news? He said that he divorced your sister so that he could marry you. Tell me, is this a lie? Is this something so small
that you hide it from me? Please, I just wanted to keep
you away from stress. Stress? The truth is that your
actions are stressing me. Are you doubting me? Yes. The thing is that
if the two of us live together, that has our happiness in it. And it was my job to lift
the veil from your eyes, which I have done. Now, it's up to you. I think it would be better
if you separate your paths from her and divorce her. Are you not happy? Happy about what? Such great good news
is going to come to our home. I am surprised that you are asking me and I don’t even see any
happiness on your face. When I feel happiness,
I'll be happy as well. Right now, I don’t feel anything. What do you mean? I don’t understand. Even I am not able to understand it. When I understand,
I will make you understand, as well. Deen Mohammad, who sent this? Hey, Amma Saeein, I have received the sweets
and fruits you sent. But this is a lot. This is nothing in comparison to
the great news you’ve given us. I can’t believe that my Nosherwan is going
to become a father. Your Baba Saeein and
I are really happy. Where is he? Let me talk to him. I will congratulate him. Yes, yes, he is here. Talk to him. Amma Saeein wants to talk to you. Greetings Mother. Greetings. May you live long
and stay happy. May you be blessed
with wealth and children. Nosherwan, I am so happy. Ever since Dua told me,
I’ve been over the moon. If your Baba Saeein was well, then I would have flown to you. He has a slight fever. If he is really unwell,
then I will come over. There is nothing to worry about, it is just seasonable fever. Your Baba Saeein has
some important work here, once he finishes it, then we will come
to Karachi ourselves. You just have to take
a lot of care of our daughter-in-law. After so many years, a little guest is about
to arrive at our home. If the mother is happy, it will have a positive
effect on the baby. Amma Saeein, I am getting a call. I will talk to you later. Bye. Yes, Amma Saeein. He got an important call,
that’s why he left. How are my children? I hope they are not
fighting with each other. I hope they are not bothering anyone. It would have been better that Dua had told you everything herself. But, fine, since you’ve gone through
the trouble to call me here, I will tell you everything. Yes, I did come to
your house yesterday. I came at Dua's request.
She called me. Now, if you want to know
what we talked about there, then the summary for it is that we had an incomplete love and we want to complete it. But, tell me, who do I need to congratulate? You, Nosherwan Saeein, or Sarfaraz? What nonsense is this? I am talking nonsense? He was saying that… What was he saying? Dua, I had heard both of you talk. Is Jaffar here? No. Mr. Jaffar didn’t come. Okay. Even his number is off. Yes. I don’t know Madam. Okay. Fine. Go. Sure. What happened? Is Saeein not answering your phone? Why are you bothering me? I am bothering you? You are the one who is bothering me. You are thinking of giving
an heir to Nosherwan Saeein, and you are saying that I am bothering you. Huh? Are you envious? Well, it's only natural for
me to feel envious. You are giving Nosherwan Saeein the happiness
that I should have given him. I will feel envious. If you continue to envy like this, then you will continue
to envy all your life. By the way, I am not that envious, because there’s also a bit of peace. Aren't you going to ask why? Nosherwan Saeein doesn’t think that this is his child. I have some reassurance about this. What do you mean? Mind what you say. I should mind what I say? You know Sarfaraz has admitted that something has been
going on between you two... God knows what. So, this child as well... what can I even say? Anyone would think
the same, right? How many people will you silence? Your sister? She's already turned against you,
hasn't she? Your family, Sarfaraz, me, or Nosherwan Saeein? The truth is, Dua, you can't silence anyone. Hmm, Hey, I was just giving you some advice. Why are you getting upset? Why would I be envious? I have been calling
you since morning, but you didn’t respond. I was busy. Fine, I understand
you were busy, but when Amma Saeein
called in the morning, why did you leave in the middle? What was the need to inform
the people at the mansion? Were we supposed to
hide this from them? I would have told them myself. What was the need
for you to announce it? I didn’t say anything wrong. I just told them what was their right. Why are you getting upset with me? I have just told Amma Saeein that she will be a grandmother and she was really happy. Then why are you getting upset? Because this is something
to be upset about. How can I make someone the part of
the happiness that I have not felt myself? What are you saying?
I don’t understand. You will understand everything. You will understand everything. Why did you call? I thought you would be really happy. I have called to congratulate you, but you are really angry. I don’t want any
congratulations from you. Okay, if you don’t want it,
then I will congratulate Dua. By the way, you have
confirmed from her who the father of the child is, right? Ghaznavi, I don’t know… he is talking nonsense. I… What nonsense is he speaking? I don’t know why he was saying all this. Who else would know? Why are you asking me this? Should I ask a third person
about you and Sarfaraz? Who do I ask? I have no relationship with him. Really? If you have no relationship with him, then will he speak
this nonsense in front of you? I will ask you. Who is the father of this child? Ghaznavi! Hmm. Do you want this? I want this. Thank you, Welcome, Greetings. Here you go. Greetings. Greetings. Come, have breakfast. Don’t you get tired? He is not giving you
any importance, and yet you keep pursuing him. Why don’t you stay in your limit? How do I stay within my limit? I cannot see you
getting humiliated like this. I feel sorry. Hmm. I don't need your fake sympathy. Be thankful that
I am sympathizing with you, even if it is fake. Okay? Be thankful. Give me that. Have your breakfast. Be quick. Come. We wanted to come to your home
to congratulate you. We changed our mind thinking
Fiza would be left alone at home. She doesn’t get ready to go anywhere. No problem. I came over. You can congratulate me now. May God grant you
the happiness of having children. Amen. Sister, I will name your baby. Fine. You name them. Fine. Then I'll start thinking
about it right away. But should I think of names
for a baby girl or a boy? Hmmm. You do one thing,
think about names for both. Whatever it will be,
the name will be decided by you. This is absolutely right. Fiza, you too come here. Sit with us. I am fine here. What have I done, Fiza? After such great losses of mine, do you want to receive congratulations
for your happiness from me? You know, you are still exactly like before. Selfish. Even today, you are only thinking
about your own happiness. You don't see my pain,
my suffering. You still want me to
cover up your faults, but I am no longer the old Fiza who used to overlook your mistakes and be concerned for you, who used to care about you. You have done so much
with me, after that, I no longer have
the capacity within me to be a part of your happiness or to congratulate you. Dua... Child, the juice? Have some water. Why did you come here? What has happened to you? We are sisters. Whatever I did, I did it unknowingly. Can’t you forgive me? I have asked you for
forgiveness so many times. Did I ask you to seek
forgiveness from me? When I have told you not to talk to me, then don’t test my patience by
coming in front of me again and again. I don’t want your apology. Why are you considering
what Sarfaraz said to be true? I am your sister and you don’t trust me? Fiza, I realize your pain. Realize? If you had realized my pain, then you wouldn’t have done all that because of which
my life got ruined. Look at my condition. Look at your condition. You live a comfortable life in
a luxurious home despite your sins. You have a supportive
husband like Ghaznavi and are about to become a mother. But me? You don’t see my condition? I haven’t committed any sins, so why am I left desolate? My child is deprived of a father’s affection
before even coming into this world. Only because of you, Dua. And your child? When he comes into this world, he will have a father’s affection,
the love of grandparents, a happy life, everything good. And what will my child have?
Have you ever thought about it? The loss I’ve faced
is only because of you, Dua, and I can never forgive you for it. I cannot forgive you, no matter how much I want to. Don’t come here every day. Don’t cause me distress. Just go. Go. Fiza. He is not giving you
any importance, and yet you keep pursuing him. Go ahead. I want to meet you right now. How did you even think
that I would meet you? I have to meet you.
I want to talk about something important. And I will only talk when I meet you. Neither do I want to talk to you, nor will I meet you. I am so close to you now. Won’t you even talk to me now? Stop the car. Stop the car on the side. Go ahead. What do you want to talk about? Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you. After all the nonsense you’ve
spoken in front of Ghaznavi, you still have
the nerve to congratulate me? Hey, I called to congratulate him. Now, he got upset hearing my voice, I just said something. But, I didn’t say anything wrong. Enough. You have broken off
your relationship with Fiza. Never come into my path again and don’t try to have any
connection with me. Dua. I want to meet you. I want to see you. I want to make you part of my life. Have you thought about this? Stop your nonsense. And in the future neither
follow me nor come in front of me. Understand one thing, even if Ghaznavi takes my life, I will keep on saying that I have loved you, and I will always love you.
