It's time for your medicine. Jaffar is here to take care of me.
You go from here. Why will Jaffar take care of you? I will do it. I am your wife. One of your wives has
already left you, so what? I am here to take care of you. I will take care of you. I told you to leave from here. What? Please go from here! Jaffar! Yes Sir. Dua came to meet me at the hospital? Jaffar, I am asking you,
did Dua come to meet me or not? Yes, she came. But no one let her meet you, Sir. Everyone blamed her, saying
she wanted to take your life. Do you think the same? Yes, maybe... Sir, nothing is more important
to me than you. If something had happened to you, Sir I would’ve forgotten that
she is my Madam. No, Jaffar, no matter what happens to me, no matter how many people
accuse her of being a criminal... You must always protect your Madam. That is my order. God forbid something happens to you... From now on, Sir, I will protect you even more. I do not doubt your loyalty, Jaffar. Why are you so sure that, that Madam wouldn’t poison you? People who take lives
aren’t like that, Jaffar. She is a soft-hearted person. My heart tells me that
she couldn’t take my life. But reality also seems to say that...
that day, Madam was making food, and Sarfaraz was in constant
communication with her. He even went to the police station
to get her bail. It is here, that I feel so helpless. You…. Alright, Sir, once you feel better, we’ll talk. No, I need to go. Where do you need to go, Sir? Right now, your health isn't good. You should rest. I'm fine. I need to meet Dua. Alright, Sir, if you want to meet her,
I’ll bring her here to you. I will go to her myself. I need to meet her,
it’s important. Who is it? You? -Where are you going?
-Dua…. Dua… Dua? What are you doing here?
Get out of here! Look, look, Dua, forgive me. I am alone,
left with nothing. I have nothing, and I love you. I ask for your forgiveness
for everything I did to you, I have done a lot of injustice towards you. Forgive me, please,
let me back into your life. What nonsense are you talking about? Get out of here! Fiza, Fiza, you tell her yourself why
I divorced you and how much I love her. I only divorced you just to marry her. I admit I didn’t value you, but please, take me back into your life. Please. You were a liar yesterday,
and you're still a liar today. -Get lost!
-Alright, fine, say what you have to say. I understand, I understand that
you married Ghaznavi for his money. And when he finds out the truth,
he will leave you too. But don’t ignore my love for you like this. -This child is ours, so with them…
-I will… Ghaznavi… Don’t come near me. Ghaznavi, he’s lying. -He’s accusing me.
-Enough, I thought, I thought maybe you would be
right somewhere. But after coming here and
seeing all this, I realized I made a huge mistake. Ghaznavi, believe me.
He is lying! Ghaznavi! Ghaznavi, please! Ghaznavi…. The job is done? Yes, it was done. Before he arrived,
I had already reached there. Good. Now, where’s my money? You’ll get them.
What’s the rush? No, what do you mean? I mean, I haven’t gotten a single penny, and you’re getting me to work,
again and again? What do you want from me? You don’t understand. If money is taken from the account, there’ll be a trail, right? If you give someone money this way, it’s obvious whose account it came from
and whose account it went to. You’ll get your money. I can’t take any risks
until our plan succeeds. Until Ghaznavi divorces Dua, till then I’ll have to move carefully. Try to understand. Oh, so this means Ghaznavi is
the only obstacle in all this. He was about to die,
so why didn’t you let him die? You wanted him to survive. God forbids! He is my husband, may he live a long life. If you have a desire to kill anyone,
you should have killed Dua then, right? I will kill her. Yes, I will kill her, but first, I need to accomplish my goal. I’ll take revenge for the humiliation
she caused me. Once she’s divorced,
then I’ll kill her. And as for the money,
I can stoop to any level for it. Remember that. If you want money, be nice to me. Don’t show me this attitude. You won’t get a single penny with this attitude. Oh really? And you think you can just toss me aside
like a fly in milk and I’ll stay silent, say nothing? What do you think? That I don’t know who poisoned him? And this whole love-drama scene
you’ve got going on with him... I understand it perfectly.
You’re after his money, or else would you have tried to
take his life? You don’t love him. And you're picking a fight with me. Hmm? Yes, that’s why I’m telling you,
if you want to walk calmly together, then stay by my side. Otherwise, if you make me an enemy, you won’t be able to
show your face anywhere. If you want to live peacefully
in Ghaznavi’s life, quietly arrange my money. You’ll get your money, stop bothering me about it all the time. Money, money. Alright, now take off these bangles you're wearing. Come on, give them. What, have you lost your mind? These are my bangles. I said, take off these bangles, or else I’ll call him directly and
tell him everything. Got it? Come on. What kind of lowlife are you? Yes, I’m a very lowlife,
but no less than you... Come on, and as for the rest of the money, don’t make me have to 
call you again about it. Got it? Yes, I’ve come to discuss a date
for Sumbul’s wedding. But son, before you said
you wanted to settle your sisters first. We thought by then Sumbul
would also complete her studies. So, what’s the rush about the wedding? A man’s word is his bond. You need to stick to it. Stay silent, Sarfaraz. I’ve thought long and hard
about this wedding. Uncle, I know I said that after my sisters’ weddings, I would think about my own wedding. But Uncle, given the current situation, Sumbul and I are fighting
more and more every day. I’m afraid that our marriage might fall apart. In a fit of anger, I might… I might say something
I don’t want to say, in anger. So now? So Uncle, please consider
the request I’ve brought to you. To save this marriage,
the best option is for Sumbul’s ceremonial departure
to happen soon. But son, Sumbul is still studying, and how will we prepare for
a wedding on such short notice? Aunty, I have no greed for dowry, nor do I need any dowry. I promise that Sumbul can continue her studies
after the wedding, and I’ll take responsibility for it. Uncle, think about it
as much as you need to, but please, I request that we have the wedding
by the end of this month. Alright, son. Thank you, Uncle, thank you very much. You agreed to Khizar’s request immediately, but how will we host a wedding so quickly? How will we prepare everything? Look, he himself said he doesn’t
need anything, no dowry, so what preparations are needed? Yes, but today he is saying that
he doesn't need anything. What if tomorrow he throws it
in Sumbul’s face that she came without a dowry?
Then what will we do? I can tell the difference
between genuine and fake. I know very well what Khizar can
and can’t do. Really? I just wish you had this much confidence
in your son too. I wish my son’s character was the same. Alright then, fine. We’ll agree to Khizar’s request and have the wedding on that date. But Sumbul is our only daughter. We can’t send her off empty-handed, can we? We’ll have to prepare something to give her. Oh, come on, I’m not that stupid either, I understand too, and now I’ve decided that whatever amount can be arranged,
we will give them cash, and for the rest,
we’ll figure out something else. This way, Khizar’s request
will be accommodated, and our desire to give her dowry
will also be fulfilled. Yes, that's right. If that is alright, then do one thing. Take Sumbul with you to the market tomorrow, do some shopping or whatever else
she wants to do. Alright, fine, I’ll start tomorrow,
I’ll take her to the market. You said you were ready for
the wedding soon, I agree with that. But why did you say for a simple wedding? What’s wrong with what I said? I don’t want Uncle to be burdened. In fact, I don’t want a daughter’s birth in this country
to feel like a punishment for her parents. What’s this talk of punishment, Khizar? What’s mine will come to me, right? Sumbul, if you accept then tell me,
and also if you don’t. What do you mean
by letting you know? I have dreams, even I desire that
my wedding should be grand. I get ready from an expensive salon, my friends come, so that
I too can upload my status. If you do it simply,
how will I be able to do all this? Sumbul, I’m telling you for the last time,
I won’t repeat myself. I’ll do it simply, if you’re okay with it, fine,
otherwise, it's your choice. Because I’m tired of repeating myself,
it’s making me mentally ill. What do you mean? Fine don’t do it. My sisters' weddings are still
at least five years away. And the way we’re constantly fighting and creating misunderstandings, I can see the future clearly. And if you really want to separate, then fine. You’re trying to scare me? I’m not scaring you, just warning you about the future. Because with the way
we’ve been fighting, Sumbul. I will make some decision soon, and this issue you're creating
is making me very angry. Fine, I’m not creating an issue. Do whatever you feel is right. Fiza, you tell her why I divorced you.
And how much I loved you. I divorced you just
so I could marry her, right? Look, I admit I didn’t value you, but please, please take me back
into your life, please. don’t shatter my love like this. -This child is ours, so with them...
-I will…… Mother! What happened Sister? -Moter!
-Sister? what happened? Mother?
Mother? Mother! Sister, what happened? Sister... Mother! Mother. Mother? Mother. Mother. Doctor, there’s nothing to worry about, right? I wish I could say that. Fiza had a miscarriage before, and this time,
I had given strict instructions, but perhaps she didn’t follow them properly. Maybe she’s not eating well
and is under some stress, which has led to her condition. The baby’s growth isn’t proper, and now the heartbeat is also faint. Doctor, is there any solution to this? We’re trying our best to ensure both
the baby and Fiza are fine, but at the moment,
both their lives are in danger. You can only pray now. Nothing will happen to her. Come. Let’s go to Fiza. Let’s go. Child, you’ll have to accept this
as God’s will and forget it. How much can I forget, Mother? Why is all of this happening to me? What wrong did I do that my punishment
just doesn’t seem to end? One after another... Even my marriage didn’t last. It ended in divorce. And now, the child I was going
to bring into this world is gone. What will I do, Mother?
What do I do? I can’t live like this. I don’t even want to live anymore. Everything’s finished.
So why don’t I just die? Have patience, my dear, everything... Mother, why did she come here? Child. Mother, tell her to leave from here. All the chaos in my life, she is the reason for it all, Mother. I can't bear you! Sania, tell her to leave from here. Otherwise, I’ll do something to myself. I can’t tolerate her.
Please, leave from here. Fiza, please. -You...
-Get lost from here! I told you not to come here,
why do you keep coming in front of me? Why don’t you understand that the person who has betrayed you
has betrayed me too? Saniya, tell her to leave. Mother…. Get lost!
Go from here! I’ll do something to myself.
Get her out of here. Go! Go! Sister, please, just leave. Will you take her life too?
Go from here. She is my child’s murderer! I have nothing left. -What else would I forget?
-Control yourself. I’ll get a good price for these. Sarfaraz, what did you just put there? Mother, at least knock before coming in. But what's kept here? This... Gold bangles?
Where did these come from? They’re mine. But where did you get
the money to buy them? Leave it, don’t dig too deep. Everything’s arranged now, why are we discussing every little detail? Whose bangles are these? I just told Mother, these are mine. Weren’t there enough sins already
that now you’ve started stealing too? What do you mean I’ve started stealing? My friend needed money,
so he was selling the bangles. I took them from him,
I told him to take some money now and I’ll pay the rest gradually. But why do you need bangles? I don’t believe a word you say anymore. Go return them. Hey, If my son has bought bangles for his mother and says he’ll pay for them slowly, what’s the problem with that? What your son is saying is not true. He stole them. You’ve made it a habit
to misjudge my son. When he says he bought them,
he bought them. And I like these bangles very much. I’m keeping them. Fine, son, keep paying the money. I’ll take them. Mark my words, one day you and your mother
will be sitting on the floor, crying. I thought, I thought maybe you would be
right somewhere. But after coming here and
seeing all this, I realized I made a huge mistake. Ghaznavi, believe me.
He is lying, Ghaznavi…
Ghaznavi, please. Get lost, go from here! Otherwise, I’ll do something to myself.
Go from her, leave! Go! Sister, please, just leave. Will you take her life too?
Go from her. There is still time, Father.
Kick her out of the house! Otherwise, she’ll poison us all and kill us. Eat something… I don’t want to. What will happen if you don’t eat? What should I do, Mother? I don’t understand what should I do. I made one mistake and
I am facing such punishment. Dear, if you have made a mistake then
you’ll have to suffer the consequences. Now, see how long this punishment is for. Sometimes the duration
of the punishment is less, but sometimes, the duration of the punishment
becomes so prolonged, that the whole life is spent. If you take one wrong step, then generations after generations
suffer the consequences. Fiza will never forgive me? Only Fiza can tell. Poor Fiza has suffered a lot. She got divorced, she lost her child,
and her family was broken. And Somewhere in all this,
you are at fault. Try not to go in front of Fiza
until she stabilizes. The food is here, eat some.
