Why did you not say no to Papa? When did he ask me? If he had not asked you, then you should have said no, yourself. He was talking to you and Mama,
what could I say? Yes, why would you say anything? Because your heart's desire to go
for outings with me is being fulfilled. I understand women like you well. You should have said no. If you don’t want to take me out then you say no to Papa yourself. Meaning, I become bad in his eyes, right? It hurts. Please. Fiza, you have no idea
how I am tolerating you in my home. In my life. If I could, I would push you out of here. What have I done? Why do you hate me so much? What have you done? I have not even started
hating you right now. I have tolerated you
because of Papa right now. I have not left you.
it would be better for you that you leave from here, yourself. What is my fault to deserve
this behavior from you? It is your fault! What? Do you want to buy the entire
shopping mall today? I have just bought a dress for Sumbul. I was wondering if we could get
a dress for Mama as well. Listen to me, you don’t need to act so good. If Mama likes something,
if she wants something, then she will buy it herself.
No, I will just check over there, if I find something good quickly.
I will not delay. Rida. Rida. Fiza. Rida. Rida. Rida, where is Dua? Where is Dua? What do you mean? And why are you asking me this? She must have come to you. She would have surely contacted you. How can you say this with
so much surety? Because after being
disappointed with all of us, she would have surely come to you. You are her only friend. I am not her friend, I was her friend. Until I didn’t know that
she ran away from her home, that too with someone. Rida, you are a really good friend of hers.
You know Dua is not like that. She is not like that? Then why did she run away from home? Something really bad has surely happened. Dua is not like that. Look, I have nothing to do with
how your sister is, and how she isn’t, and you are wasting my time
asking me these questions. Rida, please, just tell me one thing, who was that boy in her life? She must have told you about him. Where did she get that phone from? That boy must have given her that phone, which became the reason
for her life getting ruined. Look, I am not asking you anything. Just tell me the name and address, and I will find out the rest myself. That boy will surely know
where my Dua is. What condition is she in?
Fiza. Fiza. Fiza. Listen to me. I don’t know that boy. I don’t know about any boy. And as far as Dua is concerned, then, yes, after being rejected by your father
she came straight to me, to request me to give her
a place to stay in my home. We are respectable people and Dua? The place from where Dua
has been caught … that place, after that the police station,
then the police, after all this,
how can I keep her in my home? That’s why, I asked her
to leave from home. Now, I don’t know where she is. What condition is she in? And look, if you see me somewhere after today, don’t try to call out to me
and stop me like this. Along with Dua,
her friendship is also over. Who was this girl? I will deal with you when we get home.
Come on. The feeling of your presence has made the walls and doors of
this house even more beautiful. And your companionship has
given me a new life. My heart desires to bring everything
in the world to your feet. To give you everything I have. But I didn’t marry you
out of any greed. I know this. Then, you have done a lot of favors for me. Even if there is nothing, I will still always stay loyal to you. I have not done any favors. And when did I say that I am doing
all this to gain your loyalty? You didn’t say it. But I know, you have done a lot for me. First Zunaira, and then that cheque. Forget all that. No, you took me out of that hell, where I went myself knowingly
or unknowingly. You have done me a big favor. You giving me your name is
a big enough favor for me. Your companionship gives me
the feeling of being protected. I will not permit you to cry. Who was in your life and who wasn’t,
doesn’t matter to me. What will make a difference is when someone else will get a place
in your life after me. Never. I will never let this happen. All my faithfulness is just for you. Jaffar. Come on. This… Tell me something. Who were you running after in the mall? I just wanted to find out about Dua. Why don’t you get this in your head that you don’t take that girl’s name? I lost control seeing Rida. She was Dua’s only friend and she will surely know where Dua is. She has admitted that she was
the last person Dua contacted. Who has met whom, what they have been
up to is not your headache. Let me find out about Dua, Sarfaraz. Rida will surely know
what boy she was in touch with. You will find out? Huh? You will find out. Yes. What will you find out? Huh? That who she…. She didn’t do it.
How many times have I told you? My sister Dua is not like that. Enough! Quiet! If you take her name now,
then I am telling you, I will leave you forever. Sir. Madam got really angry hearing my voice. Hmmm. But it has never happened before today
that I gave you a task and you didn’t do it. Why is it happening this time? Why are you hiding it? Sir, I am afraid of a conflict. Name. Jaffar I asked you for the name! Madam Kashmala. What happened?
Where are you going? Nothing. Where are you going?
At least, tell me. There was an attack last night too, and even now he left
so angry taking out the gun. What is all this that is happening?
I don’t understand anything. May God be kind. Who asked for this? Sir left saying that we should take
special care of you till he returns. If you need anything,
then you just order me, madam. No, I don’t need anything. Yes. Listen. Do you know where sir went? Stop. When do we know where
sir comes and goes, madam? Fine. You can leave. Madam, tea. I don’t want it. take it away. Why are you burning your heart, madam? What do I do if I don’t burn it? huh? I called your sir, he gave the phone to Jaffar. He always does this with me. Why did you call younger sir? Meaning? I had explained it to you. You just talk straight,
I am really angry. I will take out all my anger on you. Just say what you want straight. Take out your anger. Nothing is worth more to me,
more than you. Go, do your work. Come on. Why didn’t you call that girl
instead of calling younger sir? You needed to make
your position clear to her. Younger sir is very fond of her. Just try telling her your position. Then see how sir listens to you. Give me tea now that
you have brought it. Madam, there is a call for you. For me?
Yes. Fine. You can leave. Where did you go in
so much haste, Ghaznavi? This is Kashmala. Kashmala? But I don’t know any woman
by that name. I think the maid made a mistake,
she gave me the phone and left. No. No. No one had a misunderstanding. I called to talk to you. To me? But, I don’t know you. That’s why I have called you so that I can introduce myself. You are the same one who picked up Nosherwan’s phone that day. Yes, maybe. But how do you know Ghaznavi? I am your Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s wife. Wife? Why? Did you get a shock? Did he not tell you? Okay, I will tell you. By knowing my status, you must have
realized your own worth very well. You were brought here
just for amusement. You are not worthy of being called
a wife or a family daughter-in-law. If that were the case, both Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein
would have been present at your wedding. No one has accepted your marriage. For the insolence of trying to take my place, you will definitely be punished. Very soon, I will throw you
out of Nosherwan's life. Greetings. Greetings. Nosherwan,
you came suddenly, son. I had no idea that someone who appears harmless
on the surface could strike in such a way. If you had not been my brother’s widow, then I would have told you what I could do. Nosherwan, son, what has happened… Ask her! Ask her, what she was thinking when she had
a vicious attack made on Dua. Why did you do this? What did you think that the truth would never reach me? In future… in future, if you try to plan
anything against Dua, then remember I am standing
in front of her as a shield, and if anyone tries to harm her then I will deal with them harshly. I am forgiving it considering it
your first and last mistake, but I will not forgive it in the future. Now that you have stood
in front of me in her support, then deal with me harshly. Only you will be the one
who will face loss in this. What has to happen,
should happen. But I will not let her stay in your life. Kashmala, do you have any idea
who you are talking in front of? I know it well. I know it well. I am speaking in front of the man who never fulfilled the responsibility
of the marriage he did with me. Did you find a girl infamous
in the world to stand against me? Mind what you say. I will not tolerate a single word against, Dua. Hey, why will you tolerate it? Why will you tolerate it? She is your favorite woman.
Kashmala, who gave you the right to talk to your husband like this? Husband? When the husband puts dirt in your head, then I will question. I will surely question him. Nosherwan, she is going mad. She has forgotten respect
for the young and old. You, go, I will make her understand. Because of you… I have to see this day,
only because of you. Make her understand in your words, or her demeanor is forcing me to snatch away the reason
to live here from her. You leave, son. He will throw me out? He will snatch the reason
for living here from me? Come to your senses, Kashmala. He will…
Kashmala. Kashmala. Why have you become
the enemy of your own life? What was the need to talk
to Nosherwan in this manner? Amma Saeein, how can you say this? Didn't you see, He was questioning me for that girl
who just arrived yesterday? He was threatening me with serious
consequences for that worthless girl. Be thankful that
he only questioned you. What would you have done
if he had given a harsh reply? You will say that. He is your son. Who am I? Just a daughter-in-law. Who was first married to one son and
then after that married to the other, without any liking. Amma Saeein, I had not asked you people to marry me to Nosherwan
after I became a widow. This was the decision of you
and Baba Saeein. Yes, Kashmala, this was our decision. And we made this decision for
the betterment of you and the children. How can you say it's betterment,
Amma Saeein? What kind of betterment is this? From the day of the wedding until today, he stands at the same point of
estrangement as he did then. And Amma Saeein,
I wouldn't have sighed, I wouldn't have said anything,
I would have stayed silent. But this sorrow of a co-wife,
I cannot bear, Amma Saeein. Get a grip on yourself, Kashmala. Understand this, Nosherwan is a man,
and a man can get married again. Maybe he did something good. He took out a helpless girl from
that quicksand, gave her his name, and gave her respect. He is giving her a chance
to live a clean life. You should be proud of
such a husband, Kashmala. How can I be proud of him, Amma Saeein? What are you saying? I would have accepted if he never
looked at me for the rest of his life. I would have stayed quietly
in a corner, Amma Saeein. But I cannot tolerate
another woman with him. Not at any cost. Now, Now, you are being selfish. What do you want? My son lives his life with a desolate heart. Once before, we asked him to sacrifice
his heart for your sake, and he did. Now, after so many years, his heart is beating for someone again, and you want to make the ground of
his heart barren with your sighs? And me, Amma Saeein? What about my heart? What do I do about this heart? I am his wife, Amma Saeein. This is an injustice to me. Amma Saeein, do something. I can beg you, Amma Saaein. I cannot see Nosherwan
with that girl, Amma Saaein. I cannot see him with her. I fall to your feet, do something. Take out that girl, Amma Saeein. Please. Amma Saeein! Amma Saeein! Amma Saeein, please. I am your Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s wife. Did he not tell you? By knowing my status, you must have
realized your own worth very well. You were brought here just for amusement. You are not worthy of being called a wife
or a family daughter-in-law. If that were the case, both Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein
would have been present at your wedding. No one has accepted your marriage. For the insolence of trying
to take my place, you will definitely be punished. Very soon, I will throw you
out of Nosherwan's life. Hmmm. So, you did what you wanted. You got married to that girl. I had given Dua my word,
Baba Saeein. Had I gone against my word, then I would have become
a liar in front of her. Instead of maintaining our dignity
in front of that girl who came into your life yesterday,
you kept your word. So why have you come here now?
That’s not true. Your respect has always been in my heart. Had that not been the case, then I could have even done this earlier. Had I done this, then Farah would have been
in Dua’s place, and Kashmala wouldn’t have been
seen anywhere in this mansion. Oh, so you came to remind us of the favor
you did to us by sacrificing. No, Baba Saeein. I am just trying to tell you that if I had to go against your decision, then I could have done this earlier too. You have still done it. You should have done it earlier. At least, Farah was from
a respectable family. Stop it, Saeein. Dua too is from a respectable family. Had an accident not made her reach there, then you wouldn’t have said
this for her, today. But, I want to say…
Saeein, what are you doing? Now that girl is our daughter-in-law. Baba Saeein, even though
I live far from you all, your blood runs through my veins. What do you think, can your blood do anything that would make people question
our family’s honor and lineage? Baba Saeein, don’t you trust your son? I trusted you, that you will not let anyone other than
Kashmala come into your life. What did you do?
I am helpless. I am helpless, Baba Saeein. I cannot express in words what Brother Zawar means
to me in my heart. Therefore, when you expressed your desire to keep
his widow and children in this mansion after him, considering them his last attachment, I did not refuse. and built a grave on my heart! But believe me,
even after all these years, I still haven’t been able
to overcome his influence. That’s why I don’t refuse from a religious
perspective on marriage. But certain positions are
decided by the heart. Please, find someone else for Kashmala
with her approval. Are you in your senses?
What are you saying? You are talking about marrying off
your wife to someone else. I am in my senses, that’s why
I am saying this, Baba Saeein. We will not get anything from
this relationship other than loss. Kashmala’s deprivations are pushing
her towards seeking revenge from me. What revenge did that poor thing take? She is innocent. Why are you making allegations about her? Kashmala was the one who orchestrated
the attack on me and my caravan.
