We will not get anything other than 
loss from this relationship. Kashmala’s deprivations are pushing 
her towards seeking revenge from me. What revenge did 
that poor thing take? She is innocent. Why are you making
 allegations about her? Kashmala was the one who orchestrated 
the attack on me and my caravan. She conspired to kill my wife. Believe me, Baba Saeein, if anyone but her 
had committed this act, I would’ve gotten 
back at them by now. But my hands are once 
again tied because of whatever Kashmala’s relationship 
is with this mansion. It’s necessary for you to
 make arrangements for her elsewhere to get her out 
of this jealousy and envy. I haven’t just married Dua, I’ve also accepted the
 responsibility of protecting her, that’s why people who attack me
 need to understand that if they ever attack my wife again, I will consider it
 an attack on myself and then I will harshly deal with 
every one of those people no matter who they are. Baba Saeein, please think about 
my words with patience. I’ll get going. Goodbye. Goodbye. Mom, what do you want me 
to make for dinner, tell me. You, will you cook? Okay, I’ll come with you, help you cook. No, you’re not feeling well, 
you should rest. I’ll cook with your instructions. Yes, she’s right, why can’t she make it? Girls should know how to cook. She’s very young right now, she hasn’t even 
finished 10th grade yet. Hey, what are you saying? What chickens are 
hidden in exams, she should learn these things. Still What still, I’m telling you, you start learning from today, start teaching her from today. What’s the hurry? There’s a hurry, that’s why I’m telling you. Uh, I didn’t understand what you said. Child, go inside, go. Is there something special? Oh, what’s special about it, get ready tomorrow and have your daughter
 ready as well. Why, do we have to go somewhere? No, some people are coming over. People, which people? I don’t know that either, they’re brother
 Khurram’s acquaintances. Brother Khurram is 
one of your friends so why are his acquaintances 
coming over to our place? Hey man, I told him to tell us if he finds
 a good match. He’s one of his relatives, they’re coming to see Sania. To see Sania? Yes, don’t you understand anything? You’re saying something
 so unexpected so… What, what’s unexpected about it, do you want to marry
 your daughter or not, tell me that. I do, but the poor girl is very
 young right now. Hey, she’s not young at all. Speaking nonsense. I’ve decided, if it turns out to be a good match I will get her engaged and
 married immediately. Hey, how can we get her 
married just like that? Sania’s interested in
 pursuing her studies further, she has to give her 
matric papers right now and then she’ll get 
admission in a college. Hey, don’t let me hear 
college’s name. The deception my one daughter
 has given me after going to college after that you’re preparing
 the next one now? Mr. Aslam, Fiza graduated as well, right? And our girls aren’t like that, they aren’t like that at all. You didn’t even listen to Dua, you didn’t even let 
her explain her side. That’s it, I shouldn’t hear her name 
from your mouth again. That’s it, I’ve decided, don’t you even dare thinking about 
going against my decision. Let me talk to my wife. Sir, madam hasn’t left 
her room since you left. What do you mean, 
she hasn’t left her room? She hasn’t had lunch yet? No sir, we all tried a lot to get her to come but madam looked very angry and she scolded us and
 made us leave the room and told us not to bother her. And you couldn’t have called 
and told me this? Sir, I wanted to tell you but… Okay, leave it. If you want, I can give the phone to madam. No. Be quick child, what are you doing, be quick. Be quick, how much longer? Yes, it’s almost done, come, sit inside, it’s almost done, come. Sania, hey, don’t cry child, you’ll get sick. What else should I do Mom? What should I do? I don’t understand 
anything myself. Mom, Mom, make Dad understand that I don’t want to get 
married right now, you, you know that
 I want to continue studying. How will my dream of becoming 
a pilot in the Air Force come true Mom? I know, I will try, don’t make 
your heart small. Dad is very strict, Mom, he won’t listen to you. What else should I do then child? Just look at you crying 
and being upset. I…I’m telling you, I…I’ll die but I won’t
 get married, Mom. Shut up, don’t talk nonsense. I hope your enemies die. I told you, let me try once, sitting idle like this won’t rid
 us of the problem, child. Do whatever you want, but tell Dad that
 I won’t get married at all. What, huh? What did you say? huh What are you doing Mr. Aslam, will you raise your 
hand on your daughter? Yes, I will raise my hand, one daughter ran away and disgraced us in front
 of the whole world, the in-laws of the second 
one humiliate us daily, what should I do? Wait for this third one to run away? My daughter didn’t run away before and neither will she run away now. I know my upbringing very well. You might trust your daughters but I don’t. If you both make any
 scenes tomorrow, I will take your life. Sarfaraz, come for dinner. Go away from here. Everyone’s waiting 
for you at the table. So, what should I do, have I told anyone to wait for me? Why are you making a scene out
 of such a small matter? You and your family are the ones 
who’ve made a spectacle of me, you’ve ruined my life’s peace. Speak quietly, if someone hears, what will they think? Let them think, my family didn’t do good 
by picking you for me that I sit here quietly. My only fault is that I saw a chance and helplessly 
went to ask about my sister. Yes, so do you think 
this is just a small mistake, or if that isn’t a crime, even though I’ve told you
 multiple times not to do it, forget her, you have no relation with her, but you don’t understand that. You made such a big threat. I’m not giving you a threat, because whatever I say, I do it. Yes, I will take care from now. Okay, come outside. I’m coming, go away from here. I don’t want anything, go. Dua, it’s me. This much anger, that you don’t even want
 to look at my face? Are you upset? I’m sorry man. There was an emergency that’s why I left without telling you. What happened Dua? Who is Kashmala? Tell me. Who is Kashmala? Your silence is telling 
me very clearly that you’ve lied to me, you’ve betrayed me, why? Why did you do this? She’s your wife, you have kids, then, then why did you marry me? Such a big betrayal, why? I’d just started trusting, and you broke my trust as well. Do you know, I really think that Zunaira is right, no one considers girls like me 
the pride of their house. The respect you have given me is what I have requested for myself. What will you do, make yourself feel better then break me 
and throw me away like some toy? Why should I wait for that time, hm? I won’t do it, no, I’ll leave before that. If I wanted, I could’ve left the moment 
I found out the truth, but I waited to see and I see the silence on your face is
 very clearly telling me that Dua you’ve gotten betrayed once again, the world is very bad and I, I’m still very stupid, that’s why every time I become a puppet
 by everyone’s hands, every time. But no more, I didn’t marry you for your name,
 wealth, or reputation, I married you for respect, respect, and now look I’m standing here dishonored. I’ve fallen from my eyes again
 after seeing my worth. I’ve become distant from everyone, I’ll go far away from you as well. I, I want a divorce. Did you hear what 
Nosherwan left saying? Yes, I heard. He’s put such a grave allegation
 on Kashmala for a new girl. The allegation isn’t wrong Saeein. What do you mean by that? Everything Nosherwan 
has said is true. I can’t accept that! A simple and innocent 
girl like Kashmala could never play 
a dangerous game like this. Accept it, Saeein, because it is the truth. What do you mean it’s the truth, did you know what the truth was? Yes, I heard Kashmala talking to
 the attackers with my own ears. She was scolding him, on how he could miss his target and after that, she confessed in front of me as well. Now Kashmala doesn’t have any
 justification left that she denies it. Such a big thing has happened and you didn’t even tell me? The matter was so big Saeein that’s why I thought
 it would be better to hide it from you and Nosherwan, I wanted Kashmala to 
have some honour left. But my silence had no benefit, Nosherwan found out himself. I still can’t believe that Kashmala could do this. The jealousy of the other wife isn’t
 just ordinary jealousy Saeein. It is God’s grace that they missed the target. If something unfortunate 
had happened, what would we have done? It would’ve been good
 if that girl had just died. Died Saeein? We separated a live 
one from Nosherwan, and you’re saying the 
second one should’ve died, do you have any idea what 
would’ve happened afterward? Nosherwan has just
 left with a threat, he could’ve taken
 Kashmala’s life as well. You’re right. I don’t see the situation improving, I, like Nosherwan, think that we should think of something 
else for Kashmala. What do you mean? What should be done, what? We buried Zawar, we buried Nosherwan’s
 desires as well but we couldn’t give
 Kashmala happiness, Saeein, she’s young, she has her whole life ahead of her. What are you trying to say, speak openly. We got Kashmala married
 to Nosherwan so that Zawar’s signs remain
 in front of our eyes and they will remain, the kids are growing up now, and I think we’ll have to make some tough decisions 
for the mansion’s survival. The kids will stay with us but you should find a good 
match for Kasmala, we will get her married 
as our daughter. Do you even know 
what you’re saying? We should find a match for 
our daughter-in-law? Why can’t we do it, Saeein, can’t you see, if this fire spreads it will burn 
down the entire mansion? Nosherwan has only made
 a threat right now, we will have to think 
of something for Kashmala. Maybe you’re right. What did you say? I want a divorce right 
now this instance. You’ve become mine 
for the rest of your life, I won’t let you go anywhere 
from my life now, did you hear me? I haven’t betrayed you. Okay, then say it, say that Kashmala is lying, she’s not your wife, say it. You can’t say it, because it is the truth. I can’t spend my life 
with a deceptive person, I won’t stay a moment 
longer in this house. You’re not going anywhere. After this betrayal, you’ve lost every 
right to keep me here. I haven’t betrayed you. Yes, I accept that I hid the truth, that’s it. That’s it? What did you think that I would never find the truth out? No, I knew very well that you’d find out the truth one day, but I didn’t think everything
 would happen so quickly. You, you’re forcing me to be harsh now. Be harsh, what will you do? Lock me in this house, keep me here or will you take my life? What else can you do other than that? You have such a bad opinion of me? The person who has
 lost themselves in you, what harm would he do to you? Listen to me calmly once, if you still think that 
I betrayed you afterward, then you can leave, I won’t stop you. Baba Saeein, Amma Saeein, don’t give me such 
a big punishment, don’t close the doors 
of this mansion on me. I’m begging for your 
forgiveness Amma Saeein. What are you doing Kashmala? No, Amma Saeein, I won’t get up from your feet until you, until you announce forgiveness 
of my punishment Amma Saeein, I won’t get up. Get up, get up Kashmala, get up. What punishment? We’re thinking for your benefit child, we want to make 
a better decision for you, for your happiness. There’s no benefit for 
me outside of this mansion. My well-being is within 
this mansion Amma Saeein, it’s not outside of it. We don’t have any other 
choice either Kashamala, you, you’ll always be 
a part of this mansion, you’ll meet the kids, you’ll come and go, the kids will come 
to see you as well, there will be no
 restrictions from our side. We just want you to 
get married somewhere nice. No, Amma Saeein, no Baba Saeein, don’t, don’t separate me from you. If you’re scared that I will cause harm to Dua 
again while living here, I won’t do that at all, I won’t even look at her. Just don’t give me such 
a big punishment, I won’t even make any 
complaints to anyone, I won’t say anything to anyone. Kashmala it’s not about Dua, it’s about your life, your happiness. We, we realize that we did an injustice by getting 
you married to Nosherwan. If we had married you to 
someone else at that time then you would’ve been happy and he would’ve been happy as well. Now he has moved on in his life, you also have
 a right to be happy, right? I’m happy, I’m happy, I’m very happy. I know I didn’t get the happiness 
of having a husband but you guys are here to 
take care of me, Amma Saeein. You and Baba Saeein take
 such good care of me, where will I go from here? My kids’ future 
is in this mansion, Amma Saeein, 
don’t separate me from you, don’t kick me out of this mansion. Don’t do this Kashmala. Saeein? No decision of ours will be
 taken without your permission, but that doesn’t mean that we will forgive what you did. I know Baba Saeein, I’m not even worthy 
of meeting your eyes, I know that my mistake 
is very big but, but Baba Saeein, let me stay in this mansion, my happiness lies here. Please, Baba Saeein, don’t kick me out of this mansion, my happiness lies here, Baba Saeein. Okay, alright, alright, no one’s sending you anywhere, come. Make Dad understand that I don’t want to get married right now, you, you know that I want to continue studying. How will my dream of becoming
 a pilot in the Air Force come true, Mom? What happened? Nothing, you looked so good 
while reciting that I couldn’t stay back. Thank you for not leaving me. I didn’t do a favor
 on you by not leaving. But yes, if you’d told me sooner all this misunderstanding
 wouldn’t have even occurred. I made a mistake man. You don’t have anything left
 unsaid in your heart, right? You’re the only one in this heart, there’s no place for anything else. I’ll make you breakfast. Hey, no, you’ll do your recitation. You can ask a maid. Only servants have
 been making it for years, now this duty is your wife’s, let me make it. This is my good fortune. Do you want to meet your family? Look, I found out that your dad closed your
 house’s doors on you. Relationships don’t end by
 closing the doors to the house. I think you should meet him. Relationships don’t end by 
closing the doors to the house, relationships end by closing 
the doors to one’s hearts. My family did the same to me. If he wanted to meet, he could’ve found me. No, maybe he tried looking for you, maybe he wanted to meet you but he couldn’t find you. I don’t want to meet him, even if he wants to meet now so… You’re getting emotional. I was before, not anymore. I’ll bring you breakfast.
