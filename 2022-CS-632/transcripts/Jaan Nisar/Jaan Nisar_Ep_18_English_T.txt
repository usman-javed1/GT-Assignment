[29.63] Yes, greetings Baba Saeein.
[32.13] Where is Nosherwan?
[33.57] He is right here, in front of me.
[36.33] Why is he not answering my phone?
[38.70] Yes, phone?
[40.30] Let me talk to him.
Yes.
[43.60] I will just put him through. Yes.
[47.03] Sir Jr,
[50.23] Baba Saeein wants to talk to you.
[59.93] Greetings Baba Saeein.
[61.73] Nosherwan,
[63.83] where are you right now?
[66.93] I have come somewhere 
for something important.
[69.73] Is everything okay?
[71.13] You leave for the mansion, right now.
[74.07] Come and meet me.
[76.23] At this hour?
[78.30] Did you not hear what I said?
[81.97] No, I heard it, but,
[86.20] can I visit sometime tomorrow?
[88.60] Is something special keeping you busy?
[94.43] I have to do something special today.
[96.73] Has your special work become 
greater than my order?
[101.27] What does Baba Saeein want me to do?
[105.40] Sure, I will come.
[107.40] I am waiting. Come immediately.
[119.07] Jaffar.
[120.67] Yes.
[122.57] The work will be done, sir.
[188.07] Saeein,
[190.63] I came as soon as I got your message.
[192.53] Is everything okay?
[200.50] The thing was such that
I had to call you.
[207.43] You too try that Kashmala 
doesn’t find out about this.
[213.10] What has happened that 
you are putting so many restrictions?
[218.80] Why do you seem so worried?
[223.03] Have a seat.
[232.77] I am worried,
[235.93] that’s why I look worried.
[238.07] May God have mercy.
[240.67] I have never seen you so worried 
about really big things.
[245.17] What has happened?
[248.43] I am really worried 
because of Nosherwan.
[257.30] But, why?
[259.60] He is our sensible son.
[263.93] This is what I am disappointed about,
[267.30] that I didn’t expect anything 
like this from him.
[276.57] What has happened, Saeein,
[280.83] that you are so mistrustful of him?
[285.40] Nosherwan has started visiting 
Zunaira’s bungalow,
[293.97] and Zunaira doesn’t have 
a good reputation.
[306.03] Nosherwan is really patient,
[309.57] he has never had such interests.
[312.63] This is the thing that has worried me.
[317.67] You call him to the mansion.
[319.97] Call him immediately and 
ask him yourself.
[324.30] I have called him.
[326.67] He is coming.
[329.37] That is why I have called you here
[332.03] so that I can take you into confidence.
[335.97] Please listen to whatever is said
 in front of him with great patience,
[343.37] and provide any arguments 
you have for resolving the issue.
[349.33] It is possible that I will be 
strict with Nosherwan,
[355.77] you don’t take it to your heart.
[359.10] Saeein, what has happened
[361.97] that you are mentally preparing me for?
[365.00] Maybe something big will happen,
[369.93] but before I bring it to my tongue,
[373.97] I want to hear the truth from Nosherwan.
[384.20] Whatever your decision will be,
[387.40] I stand with you.
[391.73] Just keep one thing in mind.
[395.57] Our son is already very heartbroken,
[399.93] and feeling desolate.
[404.00] After Zawar's death, the sacrifice 
we demanded from him
[408.67] has left me incapable of 
looking him in the eyes.
[413.83] He is unaware that 
we shattered his love.
[419.83] Seeing his sadness causes us great distress.
[425.17] This is the only thought
[428.87] that stops me from being 
strict with Nosherwan.
[436.10] Even after going through 
such a hard time,
[439.13] his steps didn’t falter, so now...
[441.83] Pray.
[443.33] Pray that whatever my ears have 
heard is completely wrong,
[449.37] and Nosherwan comes and 
proves us wrong.
[454.40] That is what will happen.
[460.10] Did he say till what time he will reach?
[467.30] He must have left by now.
[476.93] I will get some arrangements made for food.
[479.27] Okay.
[504.50] Fauzia’s committee is here,
[507.17] and Shehla is left.
[508.93] I will have to call her.
[514.57] Are you awake? 
Have you gotten up?
[518.37] Yes,
[519.77] I am awake.
[521.87] Look,
[522.93] how long will I lie to your father?
[525.90] At least get a job.
[528.63] Mama, you are saying it
[530.43] like someone is going after me 
with a job on a platter
[533.27] and I am not taking it.
[536.33] I have given my CV,
if they want to call me, they will.
[539.13] The thirsty person goes to the well himself.
[542.00] Get out there and search for a job. 
That’s how you will find it.
[546.63] I don’t want to hear your lectures 
early in the morning.
[549.10] Tell someone to bring breakfast for me.
[550.87] Early in the morning?
[552.93] It is 2:30 pm.
[555.60] And how will I make breakfast right now?
[558.40] I will ask Sumbul, 
she will make breakfast for you.
[561.20] Okay, and where is she…
[562.67] the one you have happily brought 
to enforce on my head?
[566.43] Where is she? 
Ask her to make it.
[568.10] When is she at home? 
She still hasn’t come home.
[570.87] What do you mean she still hasn’t come?
It is 2:30 pm.
[573.40] I don’t know. When she comes, 
you can talk to her yourself.
[576.70] There.
[578.57] Greetings.
[580.07] Greetings.
[582.20] Where were you?
[584.23] You get off at 1:15 pm. 
Have you seen the time?
[587.77] It was the first day,
[591.47] I didn’t know much about the buses.
[593.53] I couldn’t find a space, 
all the buses were full.
[596.23] Then, I had to take a rickshaw 
and come home.
[598.20] I got a little late.
[599.40] Here we go,
[600.97] she is making excuses right 
from the first day.
[604.23] Madam,
[605.43] the bus driver will not wait 
for you with an empty bus.
[609.43] You have to make your 
own space in the buses.
[613.03] Look, this has happened today,
[615.63] but if this happens in the future 
then you will see the worst in me.
[621.87] Go, make breakfast for me.
[624.00] You still haven’t had breakfast?
[625.77] No,
[626.83] he was waiting for your 
cross-questioning.
[629.87] Yes, I will just bring it. 
Go.
[635.30] Mama, I swear, 
I feel annoyed looking at her.
[638.37] Your father is extremely 
affectionate towards her.
[641.53] He says, I have a really modest 
and respectful, daughter-in-law.
[645.90] But, I know, she is really cunning 
on the inside.
[649.60] Look at her sister, Dua.
[653.37] Is it necessary to take her name?
[654.73] Huh?
[656.50] You spoiled my mood.
[659.10] Hey,
[660.67] what did I do? 
I just took her name.
[664.67] I don’t know what happened to this boy.
[668.20] What is the meaning of 
what Baba Saeein said?
[671.77] What is the matter, for which 
he has been called urgently?
[677.80] Is something going to happen?
[680.67] I will talk to him as soon as they arrive.
[682.93] No, I won't be able to wait that long.
[708.93] Dua,
[709.97] your phone is ringing.
[721.90] He didn’t answer my phone.
[727.53] Your poor phone went quiet 
after ringing for a long time.
[732.40] My phone?
[736.63] Okay.
[738.17] Meaning, you forgot your phone.
[739.90] Do you remember what 
Nosherwan said to Zunaira?
[742.70] This number shouldn’t be off.
[747.87] If I get a call now, then I will talk.
[750.77] Check, he must be calling.
[758.70] It is an unknown number.
[759.97] Then, you call your lover.
[765.47] He will call back himself.
[766.97] If he doesn’t call himself, then you call him.
[769.63] What if, your hero hangs us all on the gallows
as punishment for you not calling him?
[775.93] You speak so much nonsense.
[781.37] This dress?
[783.90] Why did you take this out?
[785.37] Are you going somewhere?
[786.53] Great.
[788.40] You are getting married in the evening
[789.87] and you are asking me 
why I picked this dress.
[792.33] I will wear this when you say
[794.70] ‘I accept’, ‘I accept’, ‘I accept’, 
in the evening.
[810.43] Okay, there is no need to make 
that sad face and miss your family.
[814.40] When they have forgotten you,
[816.13] then you too learn 
to live without them, okay?
[828.77] Answer it, what if he gets upset?
[834.97] Do one thing,
 you talk comfortably,
[837.13] I will come.
[845.67] Hello.
[846.90] Hello.
[848.57] Nosherwan?
[851.87] No,
[853.27] Nosherwan is not there.
[855.33] Who are you?
[857.07] and what is Nosherwan’s phone 
doing with you?
[862.00] Yes, I…
[863.50] I am asking you something, 
who are you?
[865.30] Answer me.
[866.33] I…
[869.33] Madam is calling you immediately.
[873.23] You go ahead, I am coming.
[875.37] Hello.
[879.10] Hello.
[884.77] She cut my call.
[888.10] Who is this girl?
[910.50] Come, Dua. See,
[912.57] your hero has sent such 
a beautiful bridal dress.
[916.27] Not just the dress,
[918.63] matching jewelry,
[920.93] bangles, heels.
[927.33] You have hit the jackpot.
[931.23] I had brought you thinking that 
this moon would descend in my courtyard,
[936.73] but you had already come here thinking 
about spreading light in another courtyard.
[944.37] He seems like your true lover.
[951.77] We will see
[954.23] if this love even suits you or not.
[961.87] Be careful.
[974.77] When she cannot do anything,
[976.60] the poor thing will only burst 
the blister on her burning heart.
[979.37] Ignore her.
[980.93] Look, how pretty these things are.
[982.77] Come on, come here.
[988.20] Wow, honestly Dua,
[990.70] I envy your fate.
[993.37] You found such a good life partner.
[1005.70] Brother Aslam. Brother Aslam.
[1008.63] Where are you going, buddy?
[1010.80] Where are you nowadays?
[1012.40] I don’t see you in the neighborhood, brother.
[1014.10] I am really busy nowadays.
[1015.93] Hey, brother, everyone knows
[1017.70] you people have been forced 
to go into hiding after that accident.
[1021.53] You know, after Dua,
[1023.90] now people have started 
talking about Fiza.
[1026.90] Why? What happened to Fiza?
[1028.10] She is really happy at her in-laws home.
[1031.13] In-laws home?
[1033.13] Buddy, either you are unaware
[1035.13] or you are acting like 
you don’t know anything.
[1037.23] You openly say what you want to say.
[1039.67] Buddy, she has started a job.
[1041.73] Right now, even the color of henna 
hasn’t even been removed from her hands.
[1045.10] Where did you get her married?
[1047.67] Fiza has left the school.
[1049.93] Buddy, you are completely unaware.
[1052.67] Take care of your daughter, 
what are they doing? How are they?
[1057.90] You too take care of your legs.
[1059.87] I will break them someday.
[1061.07] Brother, I am saying it for your betterment.
[1063.17] I will slap you hard. 
Get lost from here.
[1065.63] They come over and 
say what they want to.
[1085.17] Should I give you something to eat? 
You didn’t even have breakfast properly.
[1090.33] I am not hungry.
[1092.27] Please, eat something.
[1096.53] Okay.
[1098.30] Meaning, now I will eat 
and drink by your will.
[1102.20] When did I say that?
[1104.43] I was just saying that 
if you eat on time,
[1107.60] then you stay healthy, that’s it.
[1110.47] Look, Fiza, I am not a child.
[1113.47] I know well how to take care of my health.
[1117.80] Fine.
[1131.90] I wanted to ask you,
[1136.53] will you also buy me a mobile phone?
[1139.97] Okay.
[1142.63] Why?
[1144.57] Who do you want to talk to secretly?
[1147.70] What are you saying?
[1150.77] I too am thinking the same, 
why do you suddenly need to get a phone?
[1155.73] Nowadays, the phone is the biggest need,
[1159.13] and that is why everyone has it.
[1163.47] Hmmm.
[1165.50] But you didn’t have it earlier.
[1170.93] Papa had an issue with the phone, 
but now I am here.
[1176.83] So what if you are here?
[1179.73] I don’t understand you.
[1182.60] You, please, say 
what you want to say, clearly.
[1188.17] Look,
[1189.63] the clear thing is that
[1191.13] when your father didn’t trust you
[1193.40] when he didn’t trust your sister, 
then why should I?
[1198.93] But I am your wife.
[1201.60] Papa couldn’t understand his daughters,
[1205.17] but you can understand me, right?
[1207.07] And then, now, 
I am a school teacher,
[1209.93] I do a job. 
I have to contact my colleague,
[1212.67] and you know you have to research 
online for the lesson plan…
[1217.07] Okay. Okay. Enough.
[1219.13] No need to tell me the benefits 
of having a phone.
[1222.20] And even if all the women 
in the world have phones,
[1224.60] you shouldn’t have one.
[1226.27] And you know the reason for it well.
[1229.23] You have a sister named Dua
[1232.27] and you are well aware of her actions.
[1235.13] She used to talk to boys on the phone, 
secretly, did you see the result of that?
[1238.43] She ran away.
[1239.97] Dua was not like that.
[1241.70] Let me meet her once, 
I will ask her myself…
[1244.23] Don’t you dare, Fiza.
[1246.70] You don’t even have to think 
about meeting her, do you understand?
[1249.80] If you try to talk to her,
[1251.70] then I will divorce you on the spot.
[1255.97] I will make you forbidden for me.
[1258.50] What does she think of herself?
[1260.40] She wants to meet her.
[1316.13] Such a big thing happened at home
[1319.40] and you kept me unaware.
[1321.97] I found out in the morning 
when I saw Fiza outside the school.
[1327.30] Okay. So, your daughters have 
become so independent
[1331.17] that they don't even bother to inform you.
[1335.07] Fiza is not like that.
[1337.67] She must not have had 
the chance to tell me.
[1340.07] How did she not get the chance?
[1341.43] Why didn’t she tell you that 
she is joining the school?
[1345.03] God knows what the reason will be,
 I will ask her.
[1349.00] Fehmida, this conspiracy of your daughters 
to ruin my honor ends today.
[1355.80] Call her.
[1357.17] Call her. Call her in-laws.
[1359.67] Okay, let me talk to Fiza first.
[1364.00] They will consider it bad to call her
 and ask her to come.
[1367.47] They can mind it 
as much as they want.
[1369.50] I don’t care about anyone. 
Call her. Call her.
[1374.07] Cool down.
[1375.00] We can also talk about this patiently.
[1377.40] Fehmida, your daughters 
are playing with my honor,
[1381.97] and you're telling me to stay calm?
[1383.73] Call them.
[1405.07] I have never seen such a beautiful bride.
[1409.40] What is this? There is no henna?
[1411.93] These hands just lack henna.
[1415.27] One second. 
Rumi.
[1417.97] So madam,
[1419.00] I even have a readymade 
solution for this too.
[1421.13] Rumi.
[1422.20] No, Rumi.
[1425.27] A bride with empty hands 
doesn’t look good.
[1447.90] What happened, Brother Aslam?
[1449.63] You called us here in such an emergency.
[1455.80] You are making our daughter 
work in the school,
[1460.53] and we cannot even call you 
in an emergency?
[1469.30] Mr. Aslam,
[1471.10] talk calmly,
[1473.13] we are the parents of the girl.
[1474.60] Yes, so what? 
We are the parents of the girl.
[1477.00] What do we do?
[1478.53] Should we turn our existence 
into a doormat?
[1480.77] So, that whoever comes can wipe 
their shoes and goes.
[1483.77] What are you saying, Brother Aslam?
[1486.17] Why would we make Fiza do a job?
[1488.77] Is it not true that Fiza has 
joined the school again?
[1493.90] Yes, it is true, but…
[1495.70] You let me talk.
[1497.40] What hell broke loose 
if your daughter joined the school?
[1502.07] Huh?
[1503.43] She used to do a job earlier as well.
[1505.33] Did you scream like this earlier too?
[1508.93] That was different.
[1510.23] What was different?
Mama, one minute.
[1514.20] Firstly, you tell me, 
why are you screaming?
[1517.13] Sarfaraz, son, I am talking.
[1520.00] No, papa.
[1521.97] Let me talk to him today.
[1525.20] She was doing a job before marriage,
and taking care of your expenses,
[1527.43] then there was no issue.
[1528.93] But, today, when she is doing 
the same job again,
[1531.33] you are calling us here 
and humiliating us.
[1534.07] Sarfaraz, son,
[1535.43] it is a matter of the home,
[1536.70] so let’s talk calmly among ourselves.
[1539.07] Yes, you don’t make me understand this,
make him understand.
[1542.33] Because I know, he can scream and 
shout and make you agree to what he says.
[1545.37] But this will not work with us.
[1546.83] Be quiet, Sarfaraz.
[1548.07] Why should he be quiet?
Let him talk.
[1550.63] He is right.
[1552.13] One daughter ran away 
on the day of the wedding,
[1554.50] we married and took away the other one.
[1557.03] Instead of accepting our favor,
[1559.40] he got upset with us.
[1561.33] Before calling and humiliating us,
[1563.23] you should have asked your daughter
[1564.90] if we had put a gun to her head,
to go and do a job.
[1569.83] Why are you standing there cunningly?
[1571.33] Why don’t you tell your father?
[1572.97] What will she say?
[1575.50] She and her family have taken up 
the responsibility to humiliate us.
[1580.27] Hey, speak up. 
Why don’t you say something?
[1583.23] Yes.
[1585.00] Yes, papa,
[1587.07] I am doing this job by my will.
[1589.60] Did you hear that?
[1591.73] Your daughters are really broad-minded.
[1594.47] One daughter ran away from home,
[1596.10] and the other daughter didn’t 
want to stay at home.
[1598.17] She doesn’t like it at home.
[1599.43] And instead, you are humiliating us.
[1601.30] Wow, just wow.
[1602.73] Hey,
[1604.17] listen, end this discussion now.
[1606.80] Huh.
[1607.87] End it.
[1609.67] Papa is right.
[1612.93] We should end this discussion 
and this relationship.
[1627.30] Hey, Sarfaraz….
[1685.07] Greetings Amma.
[1700.60] How are you Baba Saeein?
[1702.10] We have called you here to 
ask about your well-being.
[1707.20] Sit down.
[1727.43] Dua,
[1728.67] you are so lucky.
[1730.90] I wish, we too had found 
someone like this.
[1734.60] Hey, stop it, you people.
[1737.27] Don’t put an evil eye on Dua’s happiness.
[1744.23] The cleric is here. 
Should I call him?
[1747.37] Yes, yes, the cleric is here, call him.
[1755.17] The cleric is here,
[1758.37] but till now, the mister is not here,
[1761.07] who was madly in love.
[1766.27] Now, it would be good if he also came.
[1777.87] By now, you must have a good idea
[1781.07] why you have been called here so suddenly.
[1784.97] If you explain, it will be easier for me.
[1787.43] After all that you've been doing behind 
our backs, thinking we're ignorant,
[1790.70] you still need an explanation.
[1793.03] It's astonishing.
[1795.90] I don’t understand.
[1798.63] Do you still need an explanation after frequently
 visiting the home of a woman like Zunaira?
[1808.47] Did you people call me here 
to ask me about this?
[1811.00] I wanted an answer from you.
[1813.03] Why?
[1815.03] You never had such interests.
[1819.50] Before tarnishing your 
Amma Saeein's upbringing,
[1822.93] didn't you even consider
[1824.73] how embarrassed she'll be 
once she finds out?
[1832.20] I haven't done any such thing, Baba Saeein,
[1834.50] that would cause embarrassment 
to Amma Saeein's upbringing
[1836.67] or make you hesitant 
to give me your name.
[1838.93] Then what is the need to 
visit Zunaira’s bungalow?
[1843.07] Tell us clearly,
[1844.30] we have found out everything. 
There is no need to hide anything.
[1847.57] I just want to hear from you.
[1856.03] I am getting married to Dua.
[1863.17] Nosherwan.
[1867.57] Maybe you are forgetting,
[1869.63] that Kashmala is married to you.
[1871.87] She is present in this mansion as your wife.
[1876.10] This is something I am unable to forget.
[1879.83] Nosherwan,
[1881.67] what is this I hear?
[1883.23] You heard right, Amma.
[1884.73] Kashmala is our family's daughter-in-law.
[1887.00] Did you find that dirty girl in comparison
to her to connect with our family?
[1897.20] An accident made her reach there, 
or else I know her.
[1900.70] She belongs to a decent 
and respectable family.
[1903.53] A rose only looks beautiful till 
the time it doesn’t fall in the mud.
[1909.60] Forget her,
[1910.87] and look at the one 
who is waiting for you here.
[1917.33] I will not be able to do what you want.
[1923.00] Kashmala is the same for me
as she was earlier.
[1926.67] I have surely married her,
[1930.13] but I will not be able to 
embarrass my brother’s soul.
[1934.23] I will never be able to do it.
[1935.77] Hey, he is dead.
[1937.60] Now Kashmala and her children 
are your responsibility.
[1941.90] I am not running away from any 
responsibility of mine, Baba Saeein.
[1945.80] I know they are my responsibility.
[1948.00] You wanted me to get married to her, I did.
[1950.90] You wanted the children and 
Kashmala to stay in this mansion,
[1953.67] and I complied with your order.
 But even today...
[1957.83] Baba Saeein, 
if Kashmala asks me even today,
[1961.53] I won't hesitate for a second to let her go.
[1966.80] She has every right 
to live her life as she wishes.
[1975.00] Do you hear that?
[1978.00] What are you saying Nosherwan?
[1979.63] I am absolutely right, Amma Saeein.
[1982.93] Brother died, but not Kashmala’s feelings.
[1985.93] If that day you people hadn’t insisted 
that Kashmala must stay in this mansion,
[1989.57] then it’s possible Kashmala would 
have chosen someone for herself
[1992.90] who keeps her happy.
[1994.17] Why someone else?
[1995.43] Why can you not keep her happy?
[1997.43] Because I don’t love her.
[2009.57] I have given my word to accept Dua.
[2012.13] That dirty girl…
Baba Saeein,
[2016.20] I have decided to make Dua my respect.
[2020.77] So, it would be better that you too don’t use
any such word for your to-be daughter-in-law,
[2025.23] which may make you incapable 
of looking her in the eyes later.
[2038.27] Hurry up, I also have to go to conduct 
weddings at other places too.
[2041.83] Hey cleric,
[2044.53] the groom has been missing till now, 
then how can we hurry up?
[2053.30] Dua,
[2054.67] you call Nosherwan.
[2057.13] One minute,
[2059.43] I will call him.
[2084.20] Fantastic.
[2086.17] Bravo. Fantastic.
[2091.03] Hey, such cunning can only be 
expected from someone like Ghaznavi,
[2096.40] that if you set out to find him,
[2098.93] you will end up pulling your hair out. Wow,
[2102.27] impressive! Did you see?
