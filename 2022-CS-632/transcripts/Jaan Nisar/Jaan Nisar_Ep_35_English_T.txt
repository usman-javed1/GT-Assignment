[30.80] Here.
[33.32] Take care of yourself too.
[35.88] You are there to take care of me.
[41.00] You will have to take care of yourself.
[42.76] You will have to manage
 things yourself, now.
[44.52] I cannot.
[46.96] You are there to care for me.
[50.32] After all, I get really alone without you.
[56.20] What happened?
[57.68] Where did you get lost?
[59.08] Huh?
[60.64] No, nowhere.
[65.16] Nowadays, you have 
started to stay really lost.
[71.68] Is it work-related stress?
[77.20] Yes, I am just a little busy.
[80.56] You came late, even last night
[82.52] and then you slept without having dinner.
[85.92] No, I had food with friends.
[87.88] Aren’t friends starting to take on 
too much importance in your life?
[97.44] Baba Saeein, you?
[103.72] Live long.
[104.20] My Baba Saeein and Amma Saaein.
[111.04] You people are here all of a sudden?
[112.20] Why?
[112.76] Did you not like our surprise?
[115.40] No,
[117.16] I meant had you told me,
[119.68] I would have sent Jaffar,
[121.28] you wouldn’t have had
 trouble on the way.
[123.88] Had we told you earlier,
[126.60] how would we have seen
 this surprised face of our daughter-in-law?
[134.16] Daughter-in-law,
[135.92] cover your head with your scarf 
and greet Baba Saeein.
[138.92] Yes.
[145.84] Greetings.
[146.72] Greetings. Live long.
[149.52] Greetings.
[150.88] Stay happy.
[153.04] You didn’t bring daughter-in-law to meet us,
[155.64] so we came to meet her ourselves.
[157.64] Did you do well.
[159.16] Come, please have a seat.
[160.60] I will ask the servant and get something to eat.
[163.60] Why the servant?
[164.76] I will go myself.
[166.48] No need to get into any formality.
[173.12] It is our own home.
[175.52] After all,
[176.00] we left home after having breakfast.
[179.00] We just came to see our children.
[182.00] What is the formality in this?
[183.60] You people have come
 home for the first time,
[186.36] you will have to eat something.
[187.64] I will just come.
[192.32] She is good.
[195.32] Come, please, have a seat.
[196.56] No need to get so worried,
[199.16] it is our own home.
[218.60] Bano, everything is ready, right?
[220.92] Yes, Madam.
[222.48] Nothing should be left lacking
[224.60] and you have to serve the food hot.
[226.72] Okay?
[228.08] And yes,
[229.12] did you prepare the pudding?
[230.36] yes, it is ready.
[231.44] Good.
[232.12] Only serve the pudding 
when it is really cold.
[234.20] Ghaznavi really likes it, okay?
[236.44] And you also have to 
garnish the food really well.
[241.32] I mean, decorate 
the food well and bring it,
[244.12] and you have to décor
 the table really well too.
[246.40] Okay?
[246.88] Yes, sure.
[248.36] Madam, when do I serve food?
[250.36] I am just calling Ghaznavi,
[252.36] but please check the kitchen carefully,
[255.00] nothing should be left lacking.
[257.52] Yes, sure.
[267.28] Daughter-in-law everything 
you got made is really good.
[271.20] Not yet, if I had known you
 people were coming,
[274.12] I would have tried to
 make it even better.
[276.36] You did so much,
[277.68] even this was enough.
[279.56] But, how did you find
 out what we like?
[288.48] Nosherwan told me.
[289.92] Uh-huh.
[292.28] In our family daughters-in-law,
[294.36] don’t take their husband’s name like this.
[309.48] Okay,
[311.16] I will be careful in the future.
[313.72] Live long.
[315.44] It has not been long since
 daughter-in-law joined us.
[319.20] She will learn gradually.
[322.00] Yes.
[324.00] Saeein, when do we have to leave?
[336.80] There is still time.
[339.12] If you want, you can rest a little.
[345.68] What do you mean?
[346.40] Will you people leave today?
[349.36] This is what we decided.
[351.72] No, Baba Saeein,
[353.48] stay for a few days.
[355.12] Yes,
[356.40] stay with us for a few days.
[359.28] Right now, we came in haste.
[364.24] We had something important to do.
[371.84] What important thing?
[374.32] I mean,
[375.56] you should have ordered
 me from the mansion,
[376.52] the work would have been
 done, Baba Saeein.
[379.08] It was necessary to come.
[387.76] You two don’t worry,
[389.84] we will come again.
[397.20] This time,
[398.20] we'll come with leisure
[399.40] and have you serve us too.
[402.40] I will wait.
[404.04] Okay, you people sit.
[405.72] I will go ask for the kehva.
[407.32] I will come with you.
[410.24] Please, come.
[444.64] Baba Saeein, on the way…
[459.32] Why is he disconnecting my call?
[475.40] Answer it.
[476.92] It could be an important call.
[480.08] No, it is not that important.
[487.88] I was saying did you face 
any discomfort on the way?
[492.40] No.
[498.76] I had an idea that if Nosherwan
 has chosen someone,
[502.64] then they would 
have something special.
[506.48] Now seeing you and meeting you,
[510.20] I am thanking God that
[513.24] my thinking was not wrong.
[520.24] When we come next time,
[521.76] we will meet your mother 
and the rest of your family.
[527.84] All of them would also be 
really happy to meet you.
[531.16] You know,
[533.28] when I had not met you people,
[536.48] I was really scared
[538.44] thinking how you people would react.
[542.20] When Nosherwan 
made you his respect,
[545.24] then what is there to be scared of?
[550.40] Dua,
[553.36] you are happy with Nosherwan, right?
[557.20] Yes.
[559.80] And Nosherwan?
[562.84] Is he happy with you?
[570.80] Yes.
[573.28] Maybe.
[576.28] Why, maybe?
[581.64] Don’t you have faith
 in your relationship?
[587.32] I don’t know.
[588.36] At times, I don’t understand anything.
[595.16] You know that
[597.56] Kashmala is Nosherwan’s 
wife before you, right?
[604.48] Yes.
[608.88] He did this marriage 
for our happiness,
[613.24] but he could never accept Kashmala.
[622.12] I used to be really worried
[625.00] that his heart had been broken.
[631.00] That’s why, when he expressed 
his desire to marry you,
[635.28] then we couldn’t oppose it a lot.
[642.32] Inside, even I too wanted
[644.92] my son’s heart to become
 full of life again.
[651.68] Again?
[657.28] Nosherwan is my son
[659.92] and I have brought him up.
[663.68] But, today, you have become
 our daughter-in-law, so
[666.60] I am making you understand,
[670.72] that, along with trusting 
your husband, blindly,
[677.32] it's also important to keep an 
eye on his day-to-day activities.
[685.52] Where he comes, where he goes,
[687.56] who he meets.
[690.16] You understand 
what I'm saying, right?
[694.28] Yes.
[698.16] No need to worry.
[700.60] Understand this well
[704.20] that along with Kasmala,
[706.48] you too are our daughter
[708.64] and we know how to fulfill
 the rights of daughters.
[717.44] I will just go and see
[718.92] what your Baba Saeein is doing.
[720.56] Yes,
[727.44] Nowadays, you have 
started to stay really lost.
[730.32] Is it work-related stress?
[732.64] Yes, I am just a little busy.
[735.88] You even came late last night,
[737.92] and then you slept 
without having dinner.
[741.24] No, I had food with friends.
[743.20] Aren’t friends starting to take on too
 much importance in your life?
[806.44] I don’t want to get married right now.
[808.76] Right now, they are only 
coming with the proposal.
[811.20] You will not get married immediately.
[814.20] I don’t want to go so far.
[816.20] Hey, girls dream of having
[817.80] their marriage proposals 
come from England or Europe,
[819.60] so they can proudly tell their friends that
[821.56] after marriage,
[822.68] they’ll be settling in America or England.
[824.52] I have never had such a desire.
[830.80] What is the matter, Sumbul?
[835.52] What would be the matter?
[845.44] Sumbul is worried about something.
[860.16] Bring me water.
[862.12] Greetings.
[873.60] Sorry.
[875.80] Where is your attention?
[877.24] I am sorry.
[879.20] No, tell me, what are you thinking?
[882.08] Can you do a single thing properly?
[885.12] I wasn’t paying attention.
[888.92] Really?
[891.16] Where is your attention nowadays?
[895.64] Sarfaraz, I…
[899.32] I am worried for Sumbul.
[901.76] Sumbul?
[903.76] Since when did you start 
getting worried for my sister?
[907.96] I feel she is not ready for this proposal.
[913.72] Did Sumbul say this to you?
[915.72] I felt by her demeanour, that she…
[917.32] Why did you feel this?
[921.44] Why did you feel this?
[922.76] It hurts a lot, leave it.
[925.60] No need to be worried for my sister.
[929.92] But…
[930.48] But, what?
[932.48] Her brother is alive, right?
[934.28] Her parents are there, right?
[936.24] So, they will think about her.
[938.76] But, you stay away from her.
[942.76] Me.
[944.36] She is really dear to me, 
like my own sisters.
[948.24] I felt that she was not 
happy with this proposal,
[950.96] I said it to you, but you…
[952.36] Don't degrade my sister so much
[955.32] that you are comparing 
her to your sisters.
[957.96] She is not a bad character 
girl like your sisters.
[962.16] And in our family girls 
marry where the parents tell them to.
[967.40] They are not interested
 in running from home.
[973.64] You have drenched all my clothes!
[1001.68] Hello.
[1002.80] Where are you?
[1004.84] Where will I be?
[1006.56] Are you at home?
[1008.36] Yes, why?
[1011.08] Is Dua near you that you 
were disconnecting my call?
[1014.20] Why were you calling?
[1016.52] Why?
[1018.12] Did you not like me calling?
[1020.88] I mean to say,
[1022.12] if there is something
 important, then tell me.
[1024.36] We had to have lunch together today.
[1026.36] You didn’t come.
[1030.12] But I never made any 
such commitment with you.
[1032.60] But I wanted it.
[1035.56] I prepared everything
 with so much effort.
[1038.60] All my effort went to waste.
[1046.12] And you were so busy that
[1047.04] you were not even answering my call
[1049.68] or did you not see 
anything in front of Dua?
[1053.56] Amma and Baba Saeein,
[1055.12] are here. I am with them.
[1057.24] Oh, I see.
[1059.52] There you are enjoying 
a family gathering,
[1061.72] and here,
[1063.44] I have been sitting hungry
since morning waiting for you.
[1066.04] So, you should have at least 
asked me before planning anything.
[1069.20] Why did you plan it yourself?
[1071.56] Meaning, I don’t even have
 so much importance that
[1073.40] I can plan a surprise for you.
[1075.52] Okay, relax. Relax, Farah.
[1077.96] What is the big deal about lunch?
[1078.80] We will have it together at any time.
[1080.20] You know what, Ghaznavi?
[1081.48] My emotions have 
no importance to you.
[1084.40] You are with your family there,
[1085.84] and I am completely alone here.
[1087.24] Listen, Farah, what am I saying to you
[1088.68] and what are you saying?
[1089.96] I don’t want to talk to you.
[1091.76] You know what?
[1092.68] I hate you, Ghaznavi. I hate you.
[1096.32] Hello, Farah. Farah!
[1116.48] Mama, you?
[1118.40] If you wanted something, 
then you should have called me.
[1121.84] You were busy,
[1124.88] so I came myself.
[1129.64] Your Baba Saeein is calling you.
[1132.00] Come on.
[1133.56] Yes, I will come.
[1157.12] What is the comparison
 between you and me?
[1159.52] I am Ghaznavi’s wife,
[1163.28] and you are just a friend.
[1167.64] He used to love you.
[1169.16] He used to,
[1172.00] now he loves me.
[1174.52] Okay. You know.
[1178.68] I thought were unaware.
[1181.08] It is all a fault of your thinking.
[1186.20] Now see,
[1188.28] you came like this 
after so many years,
[1191.84] to tell some filmy 
story from university.
[1196.96] You people have become mature.
[1199.64] Move on,
[1200.68] think of something else.
[1221.36] Madam, should I serve food?
[1223.36] Pick up this food
[1224.20] and throw it out.
[1225.64] And for God’s sake, 
leave me alone for a while.
[1229.00] But…
[1229.68] I told you,
[1230.72] pick up the food and throw it out.
[1233.24] Go, get lost.
[1235.12] Okay.
[1284.88] You are surprised to 
see us here suddenly, right?
[1292.16] No Baba Saeein, 
why would I be surprised?
[1294.96] This is your own home,
 you can come when you want.
[1298.32] Hmmm.
[1300.16] Anyway,
[1301.88] you have surprised us.
[1307.48] You have also embarrassed
 your Amma Saeein.
[1317.20] I don’t understand.
[1318.96] Even we were not able to understand.
[1328.32] That’s why we came here
[1331.04] so that we can get your answer.
[1333.52] The answer to what question,
 Baba Saeein?
[1337.08] Are you unaware
[1339.40] or do you think we are unaware?
[1352.24] What do you think
[1354.16] you will do what you want
 sitting so far from the mansion
[1358.92] and we will not find out about anything?
[1367.64] No Baba Saeein, why will I think that?
[1371.52] I know you are aware of everything.
[1374.04] When you know, then
[1374.68] why don’t you think once
 before doing all that,
[1378.76] that when we find out,
[1380.60] how embarrassed your 
Amma Saeein will be about your upbringing?
[1391.44] What are you talking about?
 I don’t understand.
[1398.68] You have brought back 
the past we had forgotten.
[1416.40] You never accepted Kasmala,
[1419.68] we stayed quiet.
[1425.32] This girl who came into 
your life yesterday,
[1427.36] whom we didn’t even know,
[1430.76] you married her.
[1442.84] We accepted her 
for your happiness.
[1448.76] But now,
[1454.28] where has Farah come 
from back into your life again?
[1467.56] Fine, you are a man,
[1471.00] you can get married
 more than one time.
[1481.72] But these two are not 
my daughters-in-law,
[1485.84] they are my daughters.
[1502.16] And I would never want
[1503.64] you to give any sorrow 
or torture to my daughters.
[1509.52] Baba Saeein, 
there is nothing like you think.
[1530.04] If there is nothing like that,
[1534.00] then why have you been
 seen visiting Farah’s home?
[1551.24] This is my first and last advice to you.
[1560.76] Go.
[1563.60] Okay.
[1621.56] Mama, sister didn’t come today.
[1625.92] Child, she would have a hundred
 things to do at her home too.
[1629.68] She cannot visit here daily.
[1632.04] Yes, that is true.
[1634.52] We don’t even have a phone
[1636.28] or we would have 
called and asked her.
[1640.04] Why are you so eager
 to talk to your sister?
[1642.92] Is there something special?
[1645.44] No, there is nothing special.
[1648.76] But you know
[1650.76] how attached I am to
 my sister from the start,
[1653.20] and now?
[1654.12] Now I envy her fate.
[1656.68] When she gets out of the big car, and
[1659.68] those armed guards?
[1661.44] When they guard the house,
[1663.72] I can’t tell you how proud I feel.
[1666.84] Thank God,
[1669.44] some good deed came in use,
[1672.48] that Dua found 
a life partner like Ghaznavi,
[1677.44] or else God knows 
what would have happened.
[1681.40] Truly.
[1683.16] God has really blessed my sister.
[1686.56] I want to meet Brother Nosherwan,
[1689.68] I want to sit with him.
[1690.84] I want to talk to him about a lot of things.
[1694.36] Don’t express this interest 
of yours in front of Dua.
[1698.40] When she finds it reasonable,
[1699.76] she will introduce him to all of us.
[1702.44] I don’t how he will be.
[1703.76] What sort of temperament will he have?
[1705.76] Does he even like Dua meeting us or not?
[1709.04] Mama, if this was the case,
[1711.44] then he wouldn’t let sister meet us.
[1715.28] I pray to God that he 
is just like Dua tells us.
[1718.48] Don’t worry, Mama. He will be like that.
[1739.24] Hey Kausar,
[1741.96] where is our daughter? Call Sumbul.
[1743.96] Yes, I have told her. She is getting ready.
[1746.84] Actually,
[1748.04] she is coming in front of
 you people for the first time,
[1750.48] so my daughter is a little anxious.
[1753.40] I know.
[1754.20] Girls get anxious on such occasions.
[1756.60] Yes.
[1758.20] There. Sumbul is here.
[1763.96] Greet them.
[1767.08] Greetings.
[1768.60] Greetings, child. Have a seat.
[1770.84] Come child, sit here.
[1772.40] Come on.
[1791.04] Hey Brother Naseer, 
you have met Fahad.
[1794.48] If you want to investigate further, 
then you can surely do it.
[1797.60] What are you saying, Hassam?
[1800.32] Fahad is your son, and
[1803.12] our daughter will go to your home,
[1805.40] what could be better than this?
[1807.44] What do I have to investigate?
[1808.72] Then, Brother Naseer, do one thing,
[1810.96] give us a date for
 this month for the wedding.
[1823.64] As you wish.
[1825.32] That’s it, then immediately order sweets
[1827.36] and feed us.
[1829.44] Yes, Fiza, bring the sweets.
[1831.16] Sure.
[1834.60] Congratulations to you all.
[1835.96] Congratulations.
[1836.68] Congratulations to you too.
 Congratulations.
[1843.40] Here you go.
[1859.60] Congratulations.
[1860.88] Congratulations to you.
[1862.64] Hey, feed everyone.
[1898.40] My child.
[1902.84] Are you fine?
[1903.64] Yes.
[1905.60] Hey child,
[1906.40] why do you always 
get into this formality?
[1909.52] What formality?
[1911.68] Why do you always ask me?
[1914.08] When you know this is my home
[1916.04] and I can bring whatever I want.
[1919.68] I know this.
[1921.00] You have always been stubborn.
[1924.20] You did well that you came.
[1926.52] Sania was really missing you.
[1929.04] I too miss her a lot.
[1930.28] Where is that firecracker?
[1931.60] Here.
[1932.40] Hey, she is here.
[1934.00] Hey, my doll.
[1936.36] How is my doll?
[1937.88] I am fine, how are you?
[1939.24] Absolutely fine.
[1940.68] You too are here.
[1952.24] How are you?
[1953.32] Absolutely fine.
[1954.84] I came to meet you.
[1956.12] Have a seat.
[1962.80] We too are really happy that Papa forgave her 
and gave her permission to come home.
[1968.08] No?
[1974.08] Now she can come to us when 
she wants and we will meet her.
[1977.48] Thank God.
[1982.84] What happened? Why the sad face?
[1988.44] I don’t know.
[1989.92] I just feel as if I saw
 you after a long time.
[1996.32] Have you gone mad?
[1998.16] Tell me, how are you?
[2001.88] I am good.
[2003.08] How are you?
[2004.96] Absolutely fine,
[2005.56] and I miss you so much.
[2007.24] I can’t tell you.
[2010.84] I too miss you a lot.
[2012.76] And does Brother Nosherwan
[2014.56] take care of my sister or not?
[2017.60] Hmm
[2019.12] Listen.
[2023.16] You don’t come to my home,
[2025.32] and neither do you tell
 me about your in-laws’ home.
[2030.16] Mama,
[2031.56] you introduce her to her in-laws.
[2034.52] I will request the
 brother groom to send her.
[2042.60] When do those people send her?
[2049.40] Sister has her last period free,
[2051.56] so she takes time and comes.
[2053.36] Even during that, she looks 
at the watch a hundred times
[2054.92] so that she doesn’t get late.
[2062.48] I would say that we will take your
 armed guards to sister’s in-laws.
[2066.68] We will influence them a little.
[2069.00] Who knows, maybe her mother-in-law 
and brother groom come on the right track.
[2073.32] Sania,
[2074.84] you have become so ill-mannered.
[2075.76] What are you saying?
[2076.52] Mama, look at her.
[2077.92] Child, what is wrong?
[2079.72] She is showing a little attitude. Let her.
