[52.92] Nosherwan.
[55.24] Yes?
[57.12] Why has she come here
to put salt on our wounds?
[59.80] Who?
[73.44] No, I didn’t call her.
[79.96] So, if you didn't call her,
I didn't call her,
[83.92] and Kashmala certainly didn't call her,
[87.48] then who called her?
[93.48] Who told her that today is
Zawar’s death anniversary?
[98.36] I’ll see.
[107.44] Why have you come here?
[109.72] To meet you.
[112.36] To see you.
[116.40] I hate you.
[119.04] Your face doesn't support your words.
[129.36] You still love me.
[135.16] Whatever was between us is now over.
[147.76] I will leave you very soon.
[152.68] This is my final decision.
[154.92] Go from here.
[158.92] My love will force you
to change your decision.
[173.36] My decision will never change.
[182.76] I will leave you.
[188.04] What…
[188.96] What is she doing here?
[198.48] Who called you?
[200.20] Come on, get out of here. Go.
[202.72] Why?
[204.60] When murderers are
roaming around here freely,
[207.44] then why can’t I come here?
[217.44] What do you mean?
[220.12] I'll make you understand
the meaning as well.
[222.60] What nonsense are you talking about?
[224.64] Has your mind gone crazy?
[226.16] She is saying all sorts of ridiculous things.
[232.76] Leave from here,
[233.76] come on, get out of here!
[235.60] I am not going anywhere.
[245.52] Before giving me a divorce, just once...
[250.08] just give me one chance to explain myself.
[262.60] Kashmala made a deal with
Sarfaraz to remove me from your life.
[277.12] I have proof of this.
[290.04] Just like this, keep Dua trapped
in the web of your love.
[294.52] Nosherwan Saeein has
called the lawyer and told him
[298.08] to prepare the divorce papers.
[299.92] He is finally giving Dua a divorce.
[303.44] We will soon succeed
in our objective, and...
[306.84] you will get all your money.
[326.48] This,
[327.64] this…
[328.92] this isn’t my voice, Nosherwan.
[336.60] Do you think this is my voice?
[339.16] What are you trying to do?
[347.24] Do you think they’ll believe
your words, huh?
[350.36] By making them listen to
this fake edited audio,
[352.76] do you think you'll turn
Nosherwan against me, huh?
[354.96] You shouting and screaming
won't prove the lie to be the truth.
[364.24] If you don't believe this,
I have many more proofs.
[374.44] What proof do you have, huh?
[376.92] Nosherwan, she…
[378.68] Listen,
[379.88] you, yourself were having
an affair with Sarfaraz,
[382.68] -and I think this child…
-Enough!
[396.56] If you say one more word,
[399.64] I will take your life.
[410.08] Jaffar!
[412.80] Here is your enemy, Sir.
[414.60] Speak up!
[419.68] Whatever I did,
[422.60] I did it at Kashmala’s insistence,
[441.72] she didn't want them to be together.
[457.16] Phone.
[460.32] This is Sarfaraz’s phone,
[463.00] it has many other proofs
against Kashmala.
[467.08] Have a look.
[476.72] The conversation that
she had with Sarfaraz,
[483.96] he kept it saved with him.
[491.32] So that, later on,
he could even blackmail her
[494.44] and ask for an even bigger amount.
[507.56] Kashmala even kept a price
on Sarfaraz’s head,
[520.68] but, Jaffar reached there
at the right time
[526.96] and managed everything.
[536.24] These…
[536.96] These two are together.
[543.28] These two are together!
[544.88] Absolutely!
[546.28] You are trying to trap me to save yourself?
[549.12] Well done, Dua. Well done!
[551.52] Nosherwan, you know that
Sarfaraz is her pawn, right?
[555.08] What are you staring at?
Why are you listening to her?
[557.28] Just give her the divorce
and end this topic.
[578.48] Nosherwan won’t give divorce to Dua.
[602.60] Baba Saeein,
[604.84] what are you saying?
[607.84] I made a very big mistake
in recognizing a witch like you.
[627.88] Saeein,
[630.44] this is Zawar’s diary.
[638.12] It was lost.
[644.80] After so many years,
where did you find it?
[655.28] The murderer also tried to erase this mark.
[668.08] Thanks to Jaffar though.
[675.56] Jaffar, what is all this?
[684.76] After Zawar Sir’s death,
[688.24] Madam Kashmala gave
this diary to Pirah to burn it.
[706.48] Pirah, for some unknown reason,
[710.40] did not burn this diary out of greed
or any other motive.
[722.04] And yes,
[723.48] the poison that you were given
wasn’t given by Madam Dua,
[729.44] but by Madam Kashmala.
[747.20] Pirah has already confessed to this.
[750.68] This diary was also found in Pirah's room.
[755.04] Pirah!
[772.84] In this diary,
[775.44] my son had poured out his heart.
[788.68] How you had been tearing him
apart like a witch!
[812.52] Zawar’s suspicion regarding
you was completely correct.
[819.88] Before this suspicion could be revealed,
you had already led him to his death!
[846.76] What are you saying, Saeein?
[850.44] Our enemies did not carry out
the attack on Zawar,
[856.80] but Kashmala took advantage of that enmity
[861.76] and had our Zawar killed.
[876.24] She took our son away from us.
[888.80] How can that be possible?
[891.12] Why would Kashmala want
to kill Zawar in the first place?
[895.68] Because Kashmala knew
[898.16] that if Zawar was out of the way,
[901.64] she would have to come into
a marriage with Nosherwan.
[909.88] And in this way, this snake's
heart's desire would be fulfilled.
[916.88] What kind of ridiculous thing
are you saying?
[921.08] Just thinking about it
makes us feel disgusted.
[923.56] This is the truth, Madam.
[928.16] Before his death,
Sir Zawar had expressed to me that
[933.24] Kashmala's inclination is
more towards Sir Ghaznavi.
[956.64] He had also written all these things
in his diary as well.
[968.12] And yes,
[969.92] I personally saw Madam Kashmala
dealing with Sarfaraz.
[986.68] When you were unconscious,
[987.92] she was getting you to sign
on this stamp paper.
[1000.52] She also had your thumb impression
affixed on the stamp paper.
[1014.40] Here is the same stamp paper, Sir.
[1018.16] It has your thumbprints on it,
and I took it from her purse.
[1032.76] Where did I put the paper?
[1036.56] It might be in the bag.
[1041.52] It’s not even here.
[1044.68] Where did it go?
[1053.44] It’s not even here.
[1059.28] You’re lying!
[1064.00] Nosherwan, he’s lying!
[1072.24] How can you believe him? This…
[1075.20] this is your scheme too,
isn’t it, Dua? He’s in...
[1077.56] Jaffar is in on this with her too!
[1079.28] You’re with her, right?
[1081.28] Don’t you feel any shame?
[1083.00] You’ve brought everyone over to your side!
[1092.92] What are you trying to do?
Narrow minded murderer?!
[1095.48] Enough!
[1106.84] It’s not her who’s narrow-minded, you are!
[1117.80] You’ve sunk so low in your desires.
[1126.60] that you took your own husband’s life,
our son’s life?
[1134.16] I raised you with these hands,
[1136.88] nurtured you, groomed you,
fed you in my own lap.
[1148.76] I put each bite in your mouth one by one.
[1153.76] This is how you repaid our love?
[1162.36] By killing our son?
[1165.60] Yes, I took Zawar’s life,
Amma Saeein, I did!
[1179.12] But at least ask me once why I did it!
[1188.64] Amma Saeein, I…
[1190.48] I loved Nosherwan, Amma Saeein!
[1202.92] I did all of this to get Nosherwan!
[1208.60] All of this was to get Nosherwan.
[1214.80] You...
[1217.76] I couldn’t have imagined that you…
you’d fall to this level.
[1222.44] When Nosherwan was yours,
[1226.80] then why did you try to poison him?
[1230.40] Because I was tired, Baba Saeein!
[1233.44] I was exhausted!
[1240.84] I did everything possible
to get Nosherwan,
[1244.64] I tried everything!
[1256.88] And when…
[1258.24] when everything was finally right,
[1261.00] Nosherwan wasn’t ready to leave Dua.
[1265.28] What was I supposed to do?
[1278.36] So I mixed poison in his food, yes!
[1289.56] If Nosherwan can’t be mine,
then he can’t be anyone’s!
[1301.80] Despicable!
[1303.20] Vile!
[1304.88] Yes! I am despicable, vile!
[1306.96] I made a mistake!
[1308.80] I know!
[1309.68] I shouldn’t have poisoned Nosherwan!
[1311.84] I should’ve poisoned her instead!
[1314.08] Enough!
[1316.24] Nosherwan, I...
I did all this just to have you.
[1320.36] I swear, I only wanted you,
Nosherwan, please understand.
[1333.56] Just order and I’ll shoot her right now!
[1336.16] No, no, no, Nosherwan.
[1342.00] If she weren’t a woman,
[1345.72] I would have beheaded
my brother’s murderer with my own hands!
[1352.20] Nosherwan, please.
[1368.96] Amma… Amma Saeein!
[1370.24] Amma Saeein, please, tell Nosherwan...
[1372.40] Take her away!
[1373.60] Nosherwan, why did you call these people?
[1375.48] Amma Saeein!
Amma Saeein, please,
[1377.76] why did you call these people?
Please, listen to me...
[1379.92] Take her away!
[1381.04] No, Baba Saeein!
Baba… Nosherwan!
[1384.04] Nosherwan…
Nosherwan, please!
[1386.56] Nosherwan!
[1418.68] I want to apologize to all of you.
[1436.48] Whatever I did,
[1439.00] I shouldn’t have done it.
[1452.68] Fiza, please forgive me.
[1455.96] I shouldn’t have acted that way.
[1475.56] Dua…
[1477.36] Dua, please forgive me, Dua.
[1481.72] I was always wrong about you.
[1492.08] I doubted you, you.
[1495.32] Please forgive me.
[1552.36] Fiza, the principal is calling you.
[1555.04] Okay. I was just coming
to give you this planner.
[1557.88] -Okay, thank you.
-I’ll go meet with him.
[1567.04] Sir, you called me?
[1569.36] Yes, please come in.
[1571.72] Have a seat, Miss Fiza.
[1579.36] I’m glad you decided to
rejoin the school, Miss Fiza.
[1585.04] It had to, sir.
[1586.96] I was very saddened to hear
about what happened to you.
[1595.32] It's a part of life.
[1597.76] I don't want to remember the past.
[1603.12] That's good.
[1605.96] Miss Fiza, I wanted to discuss
something with you.
[1610.96] Yes, Sir, please go ahead.
[1613.32] You know very well that
my Missus passed away last year,
[1618.08] and I have two young daughters
[1621.48] who need a mother.
[1630.60] So if you don’t mind,
could I introduce them to you?
[1641.00] I think I may have upset you.
[1645.72] But it’s okay if your answer is no,
there’s nothing wrong with that.
[1655.76] Consider it as if I never talked
to you about this.
[1660.32] You may go now, join your class.
[1686.52] You can introduce me to your daughters.
[1691.76] Okay.
[1708.36] Nosherwan must have
come to pick me up.
[1710.80] I... I’m going,
[1712.60] Nosherwan has come to get me.
[1714.04] I’m going.
[1715.32] I... I’m going to meet Nosherwan.
Nosherwan!
[1719.16] He’s here to pick me up, right? Huh?
[1720.52] I told you, right?
[1721.48] I told you he would definitely come for me!
[1723.92] He has come to take me!
I’m going to go!
[1726.36] Look, he’s here, isn’t he?
He’s come for me…
[1728.68] I knew he would definitely come!
[1732.04] Nosherwan has come for me!
[1734.20] Nosherwan has come to take me!
I told you, right?
[1737.04] I told you he would come for me!
[1739.20] I was telling you he would come to get me.
[1741.28] He has come for me… to take me.
[1743.80] He…he...
[1745.04] he has left Dua and chosen me,
he came to get me!
[1748.00] Nosherwan!
[1749.04] -Nosherwan!
-Where are you going?
[1781.40] Here’s your tea.
[1782.88] Yes.
[1798.80] Fehmida,
[1801.08] I think
[1804.24] you spent your whole life
trying to understand my mood.
[1812.12] You tried to understand everything I said,
[1816.64] but I never gave you anything in life.
[1824.32] I couldn’t give you anything.
[1827.04] What did I give you?
[1829.84] Fatigue?
[1831.36] Anger?
[1833.24] All that?
[1839.32] What did you get out of life?
Nothing.
[1843.56] What are you saying?
[1845.96] I have no complaints against you.
[1850.40] Time passed by in your short temperament.
[1857.60] Now that you’ve realized it,
[1859.32] all my complaints have ended.
[1861.48] That’s…
[1863.32] that’s your big-heartedness, Fehmida,
[1866.68] that you forgave me.
[1869.04] Otherwise,
[1870.68] my sin isn’t that which can be forgiven.
[1874.92] It’s not like that, don’t say such things.
[1877.68] Look,
[1879.16] now whatever your heart says,
just say it to me.
[1884.12] At least it will lessen my regret, hmm?
[1886.68] Actually, I wanted to say that we’ve said
yes to Wasif’s family for Fiza’s marriage.
[1895.36] But I was thinking we should invite
Dua and Ghaznavi over too,
[1901.12] and Wasif as well at home
so everyone can meet here
[1906.60] and we can set a date for
the wedding together.
[1909.92] Yes, yes, call them, call them.
That’s the right thing to do.
[1913.20] These matters should be handled
with everyone’s consent.
[1917.28] Alright.
[1918.32] I’ll invite them for dinner tomorrow.
[1922.16] I’ll call Dua,
[1924.96] and you can call Ghaznavi and Wasif.
[1928.56] Sure, I’ll handle it.
Don’t worry, invite them.
[1931.44] Dua’s one small mistake
[1934.60] caused so much trouble for all of us,
[1938.28] and even Dua suffered great losses.
[1943.12] Thank God,
[1946.00] the clouds of despair have finally
lifted from our daughters,
[1951.48] and they can now smile freely.
[1955.04] That’s my fault too, Fehmida.
[1959.88] I mean, if I didn’t drive the girls
away from myself with my taunts then…
[1964.72] then this tragedy wouldn’t have occurred.
[1969.52] You’re right.
[1971.80] May God write only happiness
in our daughters’ fates now.
[1977.64] Amen, amen.
[1980.60] What are you all discussing?
Tell me, too.
[1983.68] Your mother is planning to host a dinner.
[1985.84] A dinner for whom?
[1987.08] For the children.
[1989.00] I’m thinking of hosting a dinner at home
[1992.48] and inviting Dua, Ghaznavi,
and Wasif over tomorrow.
[1998.92] That’s a great idea.
[2000.72] I’ve only met him as the principal,
[2003.40] but now I’ll get to meet him
as my brother-in-law.
[2007.12] Yes, you can meet him.
[2009.32] Now, ask your mother what
to bring for the dinner.
[2012.80] Make a list for me, and I’ll get
everything from the market.
[2015.36] I’ll make it. I’ll make dessert.
[2018.08] Dad likes my trifle, right?
[2019.92] Yes,
[2021.20] I love your trifle.
[2023.40] It’s the best dessert in the world,
believe me.
[2028.60] Alright, you make it then.
[2031.68] Happy now?
[2033.00] Yes, I’m happy.
[2035.48] May God keep you happy, dear.
[2039.24] Amen.
[2045.40] I don’t feel like leaving you.
[2048.48] You’ll be back by evening, right?
[2050.52] Then go now.
[2051.48] Yes, I’ll go for now.
[2053.12] Anyway, it’s only a few days
[2055.08] before I’ll be able to get
your undivided attention.
[2057.92] Why’s that?
[2059.36] Because soon,
someone else will come along
[2062.12] to share you with me.
[2064.40] Oh,
[2065.72] is that so?
[2067.52] Yes, it’s exactly like that.
[2069.28] Hmm.
[2071.92] No one can take your place.
[2074.12] Well, then, hold on to that thought.
[2076.08] Otherwise, there will be
a big fight between us later.
[2078.76] I won’t let a fight happen.
[2080.44] Okay, go to the office.
[2086.36] Bye.
[2087.36] Bye.
[2088.12] -Take care.
-Hmm.
[2090.56] Listen!
[2095.44] I love you.
[2100.36] I love you too.
