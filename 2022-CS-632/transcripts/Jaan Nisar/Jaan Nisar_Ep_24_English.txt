Yes, doctor, is everything fine? Everything is not fine, in fact,
there is good news for you people. Good news? Yes, you will soon have a 
new member added to your family. You will have to take 
really good care of her. She is really weak. I am prescribing some medication. Start taking them soon,
 in fact, start them today. Fiza, you will have to take 
a lot of care of yourself. Sure. Doctor, we don’t want this child. Sorry? What did you say? 
I didn’t understand. That, we don’t need this child. What are you saying? What are you trying to say? How many children do you have? This is our first child. This is the first one? Do you want to finish your 
first happiness like this? Can I know the reason? This is our personal reason, please. You want me to help you and 
still this is your personal matter? What is this? Anyway, I don’t want to argue with you. Firstly, I will not help you with this matter and I will surely say that a mother 
wants to bring up a child, and this becomes a crime when 
the mother wants to give birth to the child. I can complain about you to 
the police right now, right this moment and they will arrest you right now. Please. Please. 
You don’t do this. It is a misunderstanding, 
we will talk about it. You can leave. Take care of yourself. Hey, these people have been gone for so long, 
they are still not back. I will call Sarfaraz. You are never at peace. Today was the first day of his job. When he came home, 
you didn’t even let him breathe, and you told him to 
take Fiza to the hospital. Hey, so she is his responsibility, I will ask him. So, he is fulfilling his responsibility. 
How else does it fulfill it? You just let it be. Dua. What lottery did you win that 
you became rich all of a sudden? You. Yes, me. Did you recognize me? I thought you would 
refuse to recognize me. We were friends. Even if not for you, I still have respect in my eyes. No. I can see that. These expensive cars, this protocol. Wow. Do you have a problem?
Yes, I surely do. Rida, what did you think? If you don’t give me a place in your home then I will become the dust of the road. No. I had an idea of the charm of your beauty. A girl who disgraces her parents' honor and runs away from home, and then progresses so quickly, how could she be the dust of the road, huh? By the way, it was Faraz 
you ran away with, right? Or was it someone else? Mind what you say. You couldn’t mind your character and I should mind what I say? You are falling really low, Rida. Stop worrying about me, what will you say about yourself, huh? Even your own blood doesn’t 
accept girls like you. Did you forget how your father closed 
the door on your face? Huh? Hey, I remembered, I met your sister Fiza a few days back. The poor thing was pleading a lot to me. She was telling me to 
give her your address. But I told her clearly, that I don’t keep any contact 
with girls like you. Listen to me. If you say another word, then I will ask them and 
have you thrown so far, that when you see me, you will change your direction, yourself. Don't act so arrogant. What if when the things you're flying high on are snatched from you and you fall flat 
on your face just as hard? You had gone to the doctor, right? What did the doctor say to Fiza
 that she is constantly crying? Why are you sitting quietly? 
Will you answer us? There is good news for you people. You people will be grandparents soon. Huh? Hey, this is good news, then why is Fiza crying? Because I don’t want a child. You don’t want a child? What do you mean 
you don’t want a child? I will sort out this matter really soon, 
you will see. Hey, do you hear the nonsense 
he is speaking? What is the nonsense in this? Hey, I don’t want a child right now, 
so I don’t want a child. What is this questioning, this... 
what is going on? What is the need for all this? Why is there no need? Neither are you an orphan nor is Fiza. She also comes from a happy, 
settled home. And then why don't you want 
to become a father? Because I feel that I cannot 
bring up a child right now. I don’t want to get into this hassle. Do you hear the nonsense 
your son is speaking? This is my decision. Talk to me, why are you saying this to her? I should talk to you. I should talk to you. Are you even 
worthy of being spoken to? What is wrong with you two? 
Talk calmly. I should talk calmly. I talk to him calmly. Hey, do you hear the shamelessness 
he is talking in front of his parents and you are advising me to talk calmly? What unique thing did I say in this? I feel really sorry for you. Really sorry. You should be ashamed. Hey, why are worried about me
 having children? They will happen when 
they are meant to happen. But right now, I don't think my circumstances
 are such that I can raise a child. Who are you and I to raise children? It is God who raises them. He will take care of them. Alright, if you don't want 
to raise them then don't. Just like I'm providing for you at home, I'll feed your children and 
my daughter-in-law as well. But, what you want will not happen. Mama, look, make Papa understand 
not to interfere in my matters. Your matters? Your matters? Yes, my matters. Fine. If these are your matters, 
then this is my home. Do you understand? And there is no place for 
a child like you in this home. Get out of here. What… What are you two doing? You are fighting with each other. 
Do you see? You were the one who wanted
 to get him married. You should have let him 
prove himself first, stand on his own two feet. But no, you were in a hurry. Now see the result. The mister doesn’t want his child…
No, no, he will not do anything like this. Sarfaraz, you go right now. Come when his anger cools down. Go. Hey, there is no need 
for him to come back. He should leave from here. We will take care of our daughter-in-law
and her future child. Get lost. You can take care of them if you want, but don’t expect anything from me. Rude, irresponsible, unworthy. Hey, he has lost his mind. What has happened to you? He is naïve. Why are you raising your blood pressure? Sumbul. Sumbul. Bring water for your father. Hey, there is no need. I am fine. You go and check on that girl, 
she is overwhelmed by crying. Madam. Yes, keep this over there. I met your sister Fiza a few days back. The poor thing was pleading a lot to me. She was telling me 
to give her your address. But I told her clearly, that I don’t keep any contact 
with girls like you. If you take another step 
inside this home, then I will bury you alive. For the sake of God, 
let her come inside. Go away from here. 
Papa, come inside. Papa, I will tell you. Papa, it is not my fault. 
Move. Leave. There is no place for a bad 
character girl like you in this home. Papa…
Move away. Move back. Get lost. Are you done with your shopping? What happened? Nothing. Why do you have teary eyes? No. Look at me. The guards were telling me that 
some girl tried to misbehave with you. Who was she? And why did you let her leave like this? It was Rida. My university friend. University friend? Is this the same girl who was with you when we met 
for the first time? Yes. So, why did she misbehave with you? In distress, I had gone to 
seek shelter under her roof. She had refused and ended 
our friendship then. Today, when she saw me in good condition,
she couldn't resist. She had thought that I wouldn't even exist anymore. You don’t need to cry 
for such lowlifes, you know. Yes. She was telling me that Fiza was asking about me. Fiza, who? My sister. Do you miss your own? When do you forget your own? Come on. I will take you to meet them. No. It's better to meet them rather than sitting
alone and crying thinking about them like this. Let's go.
No. I cannot meet them. Why can you not meet them? I… I'm not worthy of them. I'm very bad. Don’t hurt yourself by saying these things. There is nothing like that. Hurt? This is your greatness that you consider me to be good or else, my own… Do you feel like crying? Then, cry. The burden on your heart will be reduced. Sister-in-law. Drink water. You will get unwell further like this. I am fine. You are not fine. You are making me an aunt. You know how happy this news has made me. But your brother is not happy. He… Brother is wrong. Whatever he said was really wrong. None of us will support him. Papa has scolded him a lot. Did your heart find peace? Are you happy making 
the father-son fight? Mama… What, mama? How long has she been in this home? And as soon as they arrived, 
she caused trouble. She made the father and son fight. It is Brother’s fault. Why are you saying things 
to sister-in-law? You be quiet. And you. Why were you in such a hurry? Why were you in such a hurry? Tell me. It has not even been a few days 
since you started going to school. You didn’t bring the first salary and you started preparing
 for new expenses? My son was right, he cannot afford it right now, he just started a new job, and if you too use the child as 
an excuse and sit at home, then where will the salary come from? 
How will we manage the expenses of the home? What are you saying? 
What if father hears you, then? Let him hear me. When does he know 
how the world operates? And you? He dragged my son out of the home 
because of you. Those two have fought because of you. If my son doesn’t come back
 safe and sound, then you will see what I do with you. You please don’t take what Mama 
and Brother say to your heart. Should I bring something to eat? There is no greater intoxication like it 
in the world, than the intoxication of wealth. Hello. I was waiting for your call. Did you get the price? I got it. Then, till when will the work be done? Hey, you sent the money today. We have already started your work. I have thrown the first pebble from
 the past in Dua’s peaceful life. I didn’t give you such a big amount 
to throw pebbles. I want the work done in days, 
in fact, hours. Fast. It will be done. Why do you worry? When Zunaira gave you her word that I would take out Dua 
from Ghaznavi’s life, then relax. You don’t worry about me relaxing, and focus on the work. Pride ends with those who have money. Everything is available 
to these damned people. If they don’t have anything, it is the nearness to their husbands. And to get them, they need people like us. Who was madam talking to about 
taking Dua out of Nosherwan’s life? I should inform Dua. Rumi, Shariq has come outside, 
he is calling you immediately. You go, I will come. Come quickly, okay? Hmmm. Mr. Nazeer told him 
to leave the house, so easily. I don't know where my child has gone, 
right now. What would he be doing? Mama, remain calm. 
You spoke to brother. He is saying he will come back,
so remain calm. So, don’t I understand his tone? He didn’t leave to come back. God knows where my son would be. With this girl's arrival, 
my child has become homeless. If something happens to my son, then I will not leave anyone. Oh, I'm afraid my child might do something wrong. Oh dear, he is my entire life's savings. 
What will I do? No. He won't. 
He won't do anything wrong. You pray to God for betterment, Mama. Everything will be fine. Hey, the betterment left my home the moment 
this girl got married and came here. God knows what sort of people 
we are stuck with. Hey, I am tired of standing, call him. God knows where he would be. Mama. Oh my child, you are here. You didn’t care about 
your mother even a little, right? Mama, I cared for you 
that’s why I came back or else I didn’t want to come back. If something had happened to me,
then you would have really regretted it. Okay stop it. Stop crying. Thank God, Brother, 
you have come back. Come on. Do you miss your own? When do you forget your own? It's better to meet them rather than sitting 
alone and crying thinking about them like this. Let's go.
No. I cannot meet them. Why can you not meet them? I… I'm not worthy of them. I'm very bad. Don’t hurt yourself by saying these things. There is nothing like that. Hurt? This is your greatness that you consider me to be good. How long has she been in this home? And as soon as they arrived, 
she caused trouble. She made the father and son fight. It is Brother’s fault. Why are you saying things 
to sister-in-law? You be quiet. And you. Why were you in such a hurry? Why were you in such a hurry? 
Tell me. It has not even been a few days 
since you started going to school. You didn’t bring the first salary and you started preparing 
for new expenses? Did you find peace making me homeless? You are back. What? What did you want that 
I don’t come back? Huh? I never wanted that. Had you listened to me at that time, then this scene wouldn’t have 
been created at home. You are still insisting that I listen to you? Yes. Sarfaraz, he is our first child, our firstborn. People go crazy with happiness 
for their firstborn and you, here… I don’t want this happiness. What are you staring at? I don’t want this happiness. Thank God your mood is fine. I got scared seeing your condition yesterday. You were even sighing in your sleep. How can anyone stay sad for long, 
with a life partner like you? You shouldn’t remain sad, either. Why? It doesn’t suit you. Fine. I will try that you don’t see me sad 
in the future. There is no compulsion. If you are ever sad or 
if you feel like crying, my shoulder will be available. I don’t want any pain to make 
a place in your heart. I know. This one thought has kept me together, that I am in really safe hands. May God keep this trust of yours intact. Amen. Okay, tell me, do you have a plan for tonight? No, nothing special. Do you want to go somewhere? You have a plan daily, so I thought I would ask myself today. No, it won't be possible today. Any special engagement? Yes, I have to go to the mansion. Baba Saaein is not well, he has especially sent me a message
and asked me to come. Oh okay. No, no, there is no issue, 
you go ahead. We anyway go for an outing, daily. You go comfortable. I will be back by night. Don’t worry, there are people 
here to protect you. if you want to go out somewhere, 
then take the guards and driver. Sure. Listen, is… is it possible for me to come along 
to the mansion with you to meet Amma and Baba Saaein? No, it won't be possible right now. Look, I don’t want you to tolerate 
anything, anyone says. When the time comes I will take you myself,
to meet everyone. Okay? Sure. I will stay in touch. Safe travel. 
Go relaxed. You take care of yourself. Okay, listen, 
I will be out of reach. Postpone all meetings till tomorrow. Okay. What did you see that 
you turned to stone? These bosses have an amazing life. They come to the office
 when they want, when they want, they leave. They are the boss, after all. 
Yes, but I have not been 
introduced to him till now. Hey, my brother, 
how long have you been here for? You have not been here for long, 
and you are longing to be introduced. It took me two years to talk to him, and even then we only spoke for one minute. Till today, I am living in the happiness 
of that one minute. What do you mean? Does he not give importance to his staff? Boss only gives importance to the work. If you want to get noticed by boss, then do something that he notices it. or else continue 9 to 5 like us. Hey, a lot of people retired 
without being noticed. And some went home. This means he is a difficult man. Extremely difficult. Hmm. But should I tell you something? Every person has a weakness, 
he too must it. Why not? The girl he married recently 
is his weakness. The place where he got the wife from, people can say a lot if they want to, but no one has the courage. Where did he bring his wife from? Leave it, why do we care? Will you people just talk 
or will you also work? Yes, we are working. 
I will come. Okay? You are new. Try that you only work here. Sure. I will have to find out who he married. Hello. Hello, Rumi, how are you? Leave me, you tell me, are you fine? Thank God. You sound worried, is everything okay? Man, I am really worried. Thank God I got through on your number. I was worried all night long about 
whether I would be able to talk to you or not. Why the emergency? Is everything okay? Everything is fine in this ordeal. Anyway, you answer me. Yes, yes, go ahead. Did Zunaira contact you? Yes. When? A few days back. What was she saying? The same that is in her nature, 
what else? Did you talk to Nosherwan about this? No, I don’t think so. 
I didn’t tell him anything. I don’t find it to be right. Then, I don’t take what Zunaira says 
seriously, either. Man, Dua, this negligence of yours can 
become a big problem for you one day. What do you mean? Meaning, Zunaira was talking to someone 
on a call about bringing you back here.
