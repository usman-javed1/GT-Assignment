Greetings. What is the update
 on the passport? You are lost in deep thought. What are you thinking about? Nothing happened. This. What is this? What? What is this? What is this lipstick 
stain doing on your shirt? It’s not a lipstick stain. Then what is it? I’ll go change. It’s better if you understand that Nosherwan loves Farah more 
than he loves you, men don’t forget
 their first love this easily. She’s my wife. Then who am I? Who am I, Ghaznavi? You showed me dreams of love, and then sacrifice 
also came in my share, why? Why? I don’t want to repeat the past. Well, if not like that, 
then it's fine this way. I have to make you 
mine somehow, right? Sorry, Ghaznavi. You must’ve heard, everything is fair in love and war. I’m sorry to call you at this time, I know you must be with Dua. Actually, I was really 
worried for you, who knows what Dua will
 think after seeing that stupid lipstick stain? You know that was really accidental. These things
 only happen accidentally. Oh, so it’s you? Yes, it’s me. A wife forced to spy on her 
husband's affairs and his mobile. Well, at least I have achieved 
the status of being a wife, and you, you must already 
know your introduction. Did you see the proof
 that Ghaznavi was with me? Yes, I saw it. But this tells me
 about your character. Stop your nonsense. Ghaznavi was mine and is mine and 
will always be mine. Who knows how many girls
 like you will come into his life and leave? Don’t make such claims 
that you regret later on. And then you have no other way 
left than to commit suicide. You will go to a mental institute, And I will make Ghaznavi 
mine and show you. Good luck then. If you haven't succeeded 
so far with your efforts, then keep trying. I will turn this arrogance 
of yours into dust. I will wait for that. Dua, where did 
you go that day, huh? And why were you not meeting us? Mama, Papa, Sania? They are all fine. They are all fine. This…who are all these people? They are with me, for my protection. All? All of them? The phone’s not with me, how should I find out 
everything immediately that what you went 
through after that night? Did you ask anyone for coffee? Yes, I did. Do you have any plans
 to go out somewhere? No Why? I’m not in the mood. Your mood will 
change if you go out. I’ll reserve a table for tonight. Call Farah before calling
 for a reservation. Sorry, I received her call by mistake. Sister-in-law, sister-in-law, sister-in-law, I’m making tea for myself, 
will you have some? You leave it, I’ll make it Hey, why will you make it, ever since you came 
you’ve sent me on holiday. You shouldn’t give sisters-in-law 
this much freedom. You’re like my sister, I love you like 
I love Sania and Dua. I know, I’ll bring some nice tea then we’ll sit and talk, okay? Sumbul. Hmm Can you give me your 
phone for a while? Phone? I wanted to talk to Mom, I was missing her. Yes, yes, I’ll bring it, definitely. Sister-in-law. Yes Here you go. Thank you I’ll tell brother to get
 a phone for you so that you don’t have to wait for me 
whenever you want to talk to your mother. Don’t tell Sarfaraz, please. I won’t tell him. You talk to her, 
I’ll bring the tea quickly. Will you take something 
else with the tea? No, let’s just drink tea together. Only tea? Done. Who are you talking 
to on the phone? Who are you talking
 to on the phone? No one. Whose phone is this? Your friend has given 
this to you, right? No, no one… Whose phone is this? Brother, this is my phone. This is my phone Hey, what happened? What’s the matter? The matter? You’re the one 
who’s home all day and you’re asking me 
what the matter is? She was talking to her
 friend on the phone and I caught her. For the love of God, don’t put such 
a big accusation on me, I…I wasn’t talking to anyone. What are you talking
 about brother? I gave sister-in-law the phone, she wanted to call home. This is your phone? I’ll deal with you later, first let me deal with her. What manipulations are you doing
 in my daughter’s name? My daughter is innocent. If your lover’s calls come on her 
phone tomorrow, then? What will happen? Tell me, she’ll get caught in this. You’re misunderstanding. Sumbul is like a sister to me. Look, there’s no need to include 
my daughter with your sisters, do you understand? One minute, one minute, one minute, let’s find a solution 
for this right now. Give me the phone. Only your dad has 
a phone in the house, right? Let’s see right now if this is his number or not. Let’s see. This is not his number. Who were you talking to? Who is this? Hey, what will she say? These girls don’t have any traits
 of respectable women. One girl ran away
 and the second one, we’re suffering the second one, whose lover’s calls
 are coming to our house. I’m ready to take as big 
of an oath as is necessary, I wasn’t talking
 to a strange man. Then whose number is it? Should I call it myself? School teacher, my colleague, she didn’t come in today. Before calling Mom, I thought I would tell her the work. You keep telling lie after lie, how many more lies will you tell, how many lies will you 
tell to hide your lies? If sister-in-law is telling you then she must be telling the truth, if you guys don’t believe her then I’ll call the number and see, let’s see if it’s a girl 
or someone else. No, no, put it on speaker. Speaker. Give me your number and I’ll contact you, alright? Yes Fiza, what is it? No, this is Sumbul speaking. Sister-in-law Fiza’s sister-in-law. Sister-in-law will call 
you herself in a while, thank you, goodbye. Who knows why she made her 
sister-in-law call, instead of calling herself? Should I call? No. She might get in some trouble. Are we done? Are you both relieved now? Did you find out who 
sister-in-law was talking to? She was talking to her colleague. That’s fine, but how did her colleague know that it was Fiza’s call? Mom, honestly, you should’ve been in the FIA, you’re very suspicious. Hey man, I’m telling the truth, did that girl get a revelation that it was Fiza calling? Hey, in school you have to give 
one number for emergencies, so sister-in-law
 must’ve given mine. Now obviously, she must’ve saved it
 with sister-in-law’s name. Yes so, what need did she have
 to give your phone number? If something goes wrong 
tomorrow or some other day, we are the ones who 
will have to suffer, right? I will make you understand
 one thing very clearly, keep my sister away 
from these things and if I find out that you’ve given her phone
 number away to someone else, then there’ll be no 
one worse than me, do you understand? I was waiting for your call. Why? Did you want to see if I’m burning in the 
fire you’re igniting? What? What did I do? First, you meet me 
and create proof, and then you broadcast
 it and tell my wife. Is this less? I called you. Now what do I know if your wife 
picked up your call to spy on you? Why did you call? When I’ve made
 you understand that we have no relationship, neither can we ever have one. Why do you 
constantly annoy me? You're humiliating me for 
the sake of that worthless girl? Everyone knows where
 you picked her up from. Beware. If you say anything
 bad about Dua, I will forget that I ever had
 a relationship with you. You've come and 
set her up against me, you’ll have to listen now. For the last time, I am explaining it to 
you for the last time, stay away from me. And I’ve also told you, I’ve already lost you once, I can’t lose you again. I love you. But I don’t anymore. I will make you mine. Sorry sister-in-law, such a big fuss was created 
out of such a small thing. Why are you saying sorry to me? I should be the one 
who thanks you. Thank you, Sumbul, if you hadn’t handled
 everything then I wouldn’t have been able to 
maintain this lie any longer. Lie? What lie? Wasn’t this your colleague? Then who was she, sister-in-law? Dua Dua, sister Dua, your sister? Yes, yes. If brother had found out, he would’ve gotten very angry. That’s why I couldn’t have taken her name. I tried so hard but still, such a big accusation 
was put on me. No sister-in-law, please don’t cry. You should’ve told me earlier, I would’ve handled things sooner. But still, things haven’t gotten that worse. Did you ask sister Dua, where she is, how she’s doing, when she’ll come, why she went? Gently! For the love of God, if anyone hears her name then it’ll be hell all over again. Thank you, thank you Sumbul. A wife forced to spy on her 
husband's affairs and his mobile. Did you see the proof that 
Ghaznavi was with me? Ghaznavi was mine and is mine and 
will always be mine. Who knows how many girls like 
you will come into his life and leave? This. What is this? What? What is this? What is this lipstick stain
 doing on your shirt? It’s not a lipstick stain. I have to tell you something. I’m sleepy. 1000’s of women like you 
and Farah come and go, but I’m here forever. And don’t forget that I’m talking to you while 
sitting in Nosherwan’s parent’s mansion. Even since I met Dua, I just wanted to fly over here and tell you all what happened. Thank God that Dua is alright. Mom, Mom was telling that there were also cars with 
gunmen in them with the Sister, she’s not held captive 
by anyone, is she? No, our Dua isn’t held
 captive by anyone. Give me some tea. By God’s grace, my daughter was 
saved from destruction. By the way, I was scared at first too by 
seeing the guards and all the guns but then, when Dua said that they’re there for her protection then I felt relief. Sister has gotten 
so much money that she also has guards
 for her protection? Then her house 
must be huge as well, maybe like a castle? Maybe. It seemed that way. How did sister look, is she the same? No. She’s gotten even more
 prettier than before. I feel scared, will she even recognize us or
 not after getting so much wealth? Are you mad? If she was arrogant about money, would she be running after me like
 that in the middle of the traffic? I didn’t even see her. My girl is very pure-hearted, she loves everyone very much. She used to annoy 
you the most as well. Sania, that was before. She was annoyed as well. What past matters have you 
guys started dwelling on? We’ve found Dua, we’ve found out about her, is this not enough happiness for us? No, you told us all this. My heart is relieved after hearing it. That Dua is happy and safe. No matter how much
 I thank God for it isn’t enough. I want to meet sister, I miss her very much. Did she give her address, will we go meet her? No, I don’t have her address. But this, I took her phone number. But we don’t have a phone, how will we talk? Okay, stop, stop it. She’s happy, I’ve felt relief hearing that. Don’t foster too much
 hope for meeting her. If your dad hears this then all hell will break loose. Fiza, you should stay 
away from this matter. Your in-laws are already angry, they might stir up some 
more trouble for you. What will you find out? That who she… She didn’t do it, 
I’ve told you so many times, my sister Dua isn’t like that. That’s enough, quiet. If you take her name again, I’m telling you, I will leave you forever. What do you mean Mom? We’ll never be able to meet sister, she won’t come over to our house? Maybe. There is no place for her in 
your father’s heart or in this house. May she be happy
 wherever she lives. Sometimes you have to take a bitter
 sip for the happiness of your loved ones. Okay, I’ll pray prayers of gratitude, and for my daughter’s 
long-lasting happiness. Eat this as well. What is this sister, we’ll never be able to 
meet sister our entire life? Mom is right Sania, sometimes seeing our loved ones happy
 and praying for their happiness
 to last is enough. Anyway, what will Dua do 
by coming here and meeting us? Hurt her heart by listening to 
people’s gossip and their taunts? Just like mom, now I also don’t want Dua to ever return back here. May you be happy 
wherever you are Dua. Sister, have some tea,
 here you go, drink your tea. You haven’t eaten anything, eat some, I made it myself. You came back early, is everything okay? Yes, I just have a little headache. I’ll bring the medicine. Sit down. If I say that the cause of this pain 
is your anger, then? I’m not upset. Okay. Then why didn’t you tell me that you met Fiza yesterday? I thought you must’ve
 gotten the reports. Hmm But if you had told me yourself, I would’ve felt happier. I wanted to tell you but… You’re upset with me
 regarding Farah, right? You feel like I haven’t
 told you the truth. Should I not be upset? You’re absolutely
 right in your place. But I didn’t want to hurt you
 by telling you about my past. And if I say that you hurt me more by
 hiding it from me, then? Then I owe you an apology. I don’t want your apology. Can’t I get forgiveness? I wanted to tell you everything 
about Farah myself. Look, Farah is my past and my past has no 
place in my present. If anything is important to me, it’s my present. And my present only has you. Don’t you trust me? Who am I not to trust you? But whenever someone like Kashmala or Farah comes pretending to
 be obedient to you, I turn into a scared little bird. Who has no home of its own, I have nothing, no one. Where have you picked me up from? I feel scared that if Kashmala or Farah they take you away from me, then? Where will I go? I will be left empty, completely empty. I will never leave you. This is my promise to you, I will never let you be empty, you can be sure of this. I’m only yours.
