[30.27] It's time for your medicine.
[33.33] Jaffar is here to take care of me.
You go from here.
[37.50] Why will Jaffar take care of you?
[40.13] I will do it.
[42.23] I am your wife.
[45.10] One of your wives has
already left you, so what?
[53.73] I am here to take care of you.
[56.27] I will take care of you.
[59.07] I told you to leave from here.
[63.03] What?
[64.60] Please go from here!
[77.83] Jaffar!
[86.07] Yes Sir.
[88.03] Dua came to meet me at the hospital?
[98.27] Jaffar, I am asking you,
did Dua come to meet me or not?
[100.90] Yes,
[102.83] she came.
[111.80] But no one let her meet you, Sir.
[123.87] Everyone blamed her, saying
she wanted to take your life.
[133.03] Do you think the same?
[137.53] Yes, maybe...
[146.90] Sir, nothing is more important
to me than you.
[155.60] If something had happened to you, Sir
[157.90] I would’ve forgotten that
she is my Madam.
[164.90] No, Jaffar,
[168.53] no matter what happens to me,
[173.60] no matter how many people
accuse her of being a criminal...
[178.90] You must always protect your Madam.
[189.13] That is my order.
[190.27] God forbid something happens to you...
[197.93] From now on, Sir,
[200.70] I will protect you even more.
[209.73] I do not doubt your loyalty, Jaffar.
[214.13] Why are you so sure that,
[217.83] that Madam wouldn’t poison you?
[226.53] People who take lives
aren’t like that, Jaffar.
[241.47] She is a soft-hearted person.
[248.50] My heart tells me that
she couldn’t take my life.
[252.47] But reality also seems to say that...
that day,
[256.53] Madam was making food,
[258.67] and Sarfaraz was in constant
communication with her.
[263.10] He even went to the police station
to get her bail.
[272.63] It is here, that I feel so helpless.
[279.87] You….
[281.93] Alright, Sir,
[283.70] once you feel better, we’ll talk.
[287.80] No, I need to go.
[293.33] Where do you need to go, Sir?
[295.97] Right now, your health isn't good.
[297.83] You should rest.
[300.07] I'm fine. I need to meet Dua.
[311.00] Alright, Sir,
[312.47] if you want to meet her,
I’ll bring her here to you.
[319.10] I will go to her myself.
[328.50] I need to meet her,
it’s important.
[355.97] Who is it?
[360.30] You?
[361.57] -Where are you going?
-Dua….
[363.30] Dua…
[365.67] Dua?
[366.43] What are you doing here?
Get out of here!
[369.47] Look, look, Dua,
[371.23] forgive me. I am alone,
left with nothing.
[378.63] I have nothing, and I love you.
[385.83] I ask for your forgiveness
for everything I did to you,
[388.57] I have done a lot of injustice towards you.
[389.63] Forgive me, please,
let me back into your life.
[391.80] What nonsense are you talking about?
[393.23] Get out of here!
[398.97] Fiza,
[408.97] Fiza, you tell her yourself why
I divorced you and how much I love her.
[423.20] I only divorced you just to marry her.
[429.17] I admit I didn’t value you,
[431.83] but please, take me back into your life.
[434.57] Please.
[442.90] You were a liar yesterday,
and you're still a liar today.
[445.20] -Get lost!
-Alright,
[446.77] fine, say what you have to say.
[448.80] I understand, I understand that
you married Ghaznavi for his money.
[453.37] And when he finds out the truth,
he will leave you too.
[470.03] But don’t ignore my love for you like this.
[473.97] -This child is ours, so with them…
-I will…
[491.17] Ghaznavi…
[518.27] Don’t come near me.
[529.57] Ghaznavi, he’s lying.
[530.90] -He’s accusing me.
-Enough,
[549.37] I thought,
[552.87] I thought maybe you would be
right somewhere.
[564.90] But after coming here and
seeing all this, I realized
[569.90] I made a huge mistake.
[572.20] Ghaznavi, believe me.
He is lying!
[574.37] Ghaznavi!
[576.17] Ghaznavi, please!
[602.37] Ghaznavi….
[620.10] The job is done?
[624.70] Yes, it was done.
[629.83] Before he arrived,
I had already reached there.
[633.90] Good.
[637.87] Now, where’s my money?
[641.50] You’ll get them.
What’s the rush?
[644.30] No, what do you mean?
[648.90] I mean, I haven’t gotten a single penny,
[650.23] and you’re getting me to work,
again and again?
[652.07] What do you want from me?
[657.80] You don’t understand.
[660.60] If money is taken from the account,
[662.73] there’ll be a trail, right?
[664.83] If you give someone money this way,
[667.23] it’s obvious whose account it came from
and whose account it went to.
[673.03] You’ll get your money.
[675.00] I can’t take any risks
until our plan succeeds.
[682.67] Until Ghaznavi divorces Dua,
[685.70] till then I’ll have to move carefully.
[688.27] Try to understand.
[691.70] Oh, so this means Ghaznavi is
the only obstacle in all this.
[698.67] He was about to die,
so why didn’t you let him die?
[701.43] You wanted him to survive.
[702.87] God forbids!
[705.17] He is my husband,
[708.80] may he live a long life.
[711.60] If you have a desire to kill anyone,
you should have killed Dua then, right?
[714.97] I will kill her. Yes,
[720.20] I will kill her,
[721.67] but first, I need to accomplish my goal.
[727.80] I’ll take revenge for the humiliation
she caused me.
[732.57] Once she’s divorced,
then I’ll kill her.
[737.00] And as for the money,
I can stoop to any level for it.
[740.20] Remember that.
[742.27] If you want money, be nice to me.
[745.67] Don’t show me this attitude.
[749.77] You won’t get a single penny with this attitude.
[752.03] Oh really?
[754.10] And you think you can just toss me aside
like a fly in milk and I’ll stay silent,
[759.37] say nothing?
[765.03] What do you think?
[767.23] That I don’t know who poisoned him?
[774.43] And this whole love-drama scene
you’ve got going on with him...
[777.50] I understand it perfectly.
You’re after his money,
[781.83] or else would you have tried to
take his life? You don’t love him.
[798.73] And you're picking a fight with me. Hmm?
[800.67] Yes, that’s why I’m telling you,
if you want to walk calmly together,
[803.70] then stay by my side.
[808.90] Otherwise, if you make me an enemy,
[810.07] you won’t be able to
show your face anywhere.
[818.87] If you want to live peacefully
in Ghaznavi’s life,
[822.70] quietly arrange my money.
[824.87] You’ll get your money,
[826.77] stop bothering me about it all the time.
[829.20] Money, money.
[834.30] Alright,
[836.87] now take off these bangles you're wearing.
[839.80] Come on, give them.
[840.70] What,
[843.17] have you lost your mind?
[845.10] These are my bangles.
[851.27] I said, take off these bangles,
[853.83] or else I’ll call him directly and
tell him everything. Got it?
[857.10] Come on.
[857.70] What kind of lowlife are you?
[859.87] Yes, I’m a very lowlife,
but no less than you... Come on,
[881.80] and as for the rest of the money,
[884.43] don’t make me have to 
call you again about it.
[887.67] Got it?
[938.20] Yes, I’ve come to discuss a date
for Sumbul’s wedding.
[950.23] But son, before you said
you wanted to settle your sisters first.
[961.30] We thought by then Sumbul
would also complete her studies.
[966.37] So, what’s the rush about the wedding?
[974.97] A man’s word is his bond.
[980.60] You need to stick to it.
[984.47] Stay silent, Sarfaraz.
[992.30] I’ve thought long and hard
about this wedding.
[1001.60] Uncle, I know
[1003.50] I said that after my sisters’ weddings,
[1008.20] I would think about my own wedding.
[1011.57] But Uncle, given the current situation,
[1014.40] Sumbul and I are fighting
more and more every day.
[1025.83] I’m afraid that our marriage might fall apart.
[1028.70] In a fit of anger, I might…
[1036.67] I might say something
I don’t want to say, in anger.
[1049.70] So now?
[1050.63] So Uncle, please consider
the request I’ve brought to you.
[1055.83] To save this marriage,
the best option is
[1058.83] for Sumbul’s ceremonial departure
to happen soon.
[1064.47] But son,
[1066.17] Sumbul is still studying,
[1067.67] and how will we prepare for
a wedding on such short notice?
[1070.83] Aunty, I have no greed for dowry,
[1073.90] nor do I need any dowry.
[1081.37] I promise
[1084.10] that Sumbul can continue her studies
after the wedding,
[1086.43] and I’ll take responsibility for it.
[1092.20] Uncle, think about it
as much as you need to,
[1094.97] but please, I request
[1098.63] that we have the wedding
by the end of this month.
[1107.37] Alright, son.
[1110.67] Thank you, Uncle,
[1112.23] thank you very much.
[1162.60] You agreed to Khizar’s request immediately,
[1166.03] but how will we host a wedding so quickly?
[1168.00] How will we prepare everything?
[1170.07] Look, he himself said he doesn’t
need anything, no dowry,
[1175.53] so what preparations are needed?
[1177.37] Yes, but today he is saying that
he doesn't need anything.
[1181.27] What if tomorrow he throws it
in Sumbul’s face
[1184.23] that she came without a dowry?
Then what will we do?
[1188.80] I can tell the difference
between genuine and fake.
[1192.87] I know very well what Khizar can
and can’t do.
[1197.27] Really?
[1199.80] I just wish you had this much confidence
in your son too.
[1206.53] I wish my son’s character was the same.
[1212.23] Alright then, fine.
[1214.13] We’ll agree to Khizar’s request
[1216.13] and have the wedding on that date.
[1217.80] But Sumbul is our only daughter.
[1220.33] We can’t send her off empty-handed, can we?
[1222.17] We’ll have to prepare something to give her.
[1225.33] Oh, come on, I’m not that stupid either,
[1227.40] I understand too,
[1229.87] and now I’ve decided that
[1232.37] whatever amount can be arranged,
we will give them cash,
[1234.87] and for the rest,
we’ll figure out something else.
[1238.20] This way, Khizar’s request
will be accommodated,
[1241.03] and our desire to give her dowry
will also be fulfilled.
[1243.60] Yes, that's right.
[1246.17] If that is alright, then do one thing.
[1248.53] Take Sumbul with you to the market tomorrow,
[1250.60] do some shopping or whatever else
she wants to do.
[1256.97] Alright, fine,
[1258.57] I’ll start tomorrow,
I’ll take her to the market.
[1269.40] You said you were ready for
the wedding soon, I agree with that.
[1273.60] But why did you say for a simple wedding?
[1275.80] What’s wrong with what I said?
[1278.33] I don’t want Uncle to be burdened.
[1282.77] In fact, I don’t want
[1284.97] a daughter’s birth in this country
to feel like a punishment for her parents.
[1290.23] What’s this talk of punishment, Khizar?
[1292.03] What’s mine will come to me, right?
[1294.13] Sumbul,
[1295.47] if you accept then tell me,
and also if you don’t.
[1299.13] What do you mean
by letting you know?
[1300.80] I have dreams, even I desire that
my wedding should be grand.
[1307.80] I get ready from an expensive salon,
[1309.47] my friends come, so that
I too can upload my status.
[1312.67] If you do it simply,
how will I be able to do all this?
[1315.17] Sumbul,
[1316.67] I’m telling you for the last time,
I won’t repeat myself.
[1319.23] I’ll do it simply,
[1322.00] if you’re okay with it, fine,
otherwise, it's your choice.
[1324.93] Because I’m tired of repeating myself,
it’s making me mentally ill.
[1329.83] What do you mean?
[1333.23] Fine don’t do it.
[1334.67] My sisters' weddings are still
at least five years away.
[1342.07] And the way we’re constantly fighting
[1344.20] and creating misunderstandings,
[1347.17] I can see the future clearly.
[1349.37] And if you really want to separate, then fine.
[1353.43] You’re trying to scare me?
[1355.47] I’m not scaring you,
[1357.83] just warning you about the future.
[1366.57] Because with the way
we’ve been fighting, Sumbul.
[1372.80] I will make some decision soon,
[1376.07] and this issue you're creating
is making me very angry.
[1383.70] Fine,
[1385.17] I’m not creating an issue.
[1387.23] Do whatever you feel is right.
[1415.63] Fiza, you tell her why I divorced you.
And how much I loved you.
[1420.47] I divorced you just
so I could marry her, right?
[1423.13] Look, I admit I didn’t value you,
[1425.60] but please, please take me back
into your life, please.
[1429.13] don’t shatter my love like this.
[1433.13] -This child is ours, so with them...
-I will……
[1437.17] Mother!
[1438.40] What happened Sister?
[1439.43] -Moter!
-Sister?
[1440.80] what happened?
[1441.67] Mother?
Mother?
[1443.33] Mother!
[1444.80] Sister, what happened?
[1446.53] Sister... Mother!
[1448.00] Mother.
[1449.07] Mother?
[1454.97] Mother.
[1457.43] Mother.
[1504.20] Doctor,
[1505.53] there’s nothing to worry about, right?
[1507.23] I wish I could say that.
[1509.07] Fiza had a miscarriage before,
[1510.73] and this time,
I had given strict instructions,
[1516.60] but perhaps she didn’t follow them properly.
[1521.33] Maybe she’s not eating well
and is under some stress,
[1526.23] which has led to her condition.
[1528.33] The baby’s growth isn’t proper,
[1530.47] and now the heartbeat is also faint.
[1535.73] Doctor, is there any solution to this?
[1538.07] We’re trying our best to ensure both
the baby and Fiza are fine,
[1541.97] but at the moment,
both their lives are in danger.
[1545.27] You can only pray now.
[1553.87] Nothing will happen to her. Come.
[1555.63] Let’s go to Fiza. Let’s go.
[1566.07] Child,
[1568.57] you’ll have to accept this
as God’s will and forget it.
[1575.77] How much can I forget, Mother?
[1580.77] Why is all of this happening to me?
[1591.37] What wrong did I do that my punishment
just doesn’t seem to end?
[1602.57] One after another...
[1608.17] Even my marriage didn’t last.
[1613.73] It ended in divorce.
[1623.93] And now, the child I was going
to bring into this world is gone.
[1629.93] What will I do, Mother?
What do I do?
[1635.27] I can’t live like this.
[1637.67] I don’t even want to live anymore.
[1640.27] Everything’s finished.
So why don’t I just die?
[1643.20] Have patience, my dear,
[1644.77] everything...
[1646.97] Mother, why did she come here?
[1649.20] Child.
[1650.53] Mother, tell her to leave from here.
[1655.83] All the chaos in my life,
[1659.03] she is the reason for it all, Mother.
[1668.37] I can't bear you!
[1670.87] Sania, tell her to leave from here. Otherwise,
[1674.07] I’ll do something to myself.
[1675.27] I can’t tolerate her.
Please, leave from here.
[1677.70] Fiza, please.
[1679.57] -You...
-Get lost from here!
[1682.57] I told you not to come here,
why do you keep coming in front of me?
[1690.07] Why don’t you understand
[1691.57] that the person who has betrayed you
has betrayed me too?
[1696.47] Saniya, tell her to leave.
[1700.03] Mother….
[1701.93] Get lost!
Go from here!
[1704.13] I’ll do something to myself.
Get her out of here. Go!
[1707.53] Go!
[1708.60] Sister, please, just leave.
[1710.83] Will you take her life too?
Go from here.
[1715.73] She is my child’s murderer!
[1720.83] I have nothing left.
[1723.60] -What else would I forget?
-Control yourself.
[1743.23] I’ll get a good price for these.
[1753.73] Sarfaraz,
[1756.67] what did you just put there?
[1757.80] Mother, at least knock before coming in.
[1760.40] But what's kept here?
[1764.47] This...
[1766.27] Gold bangles?
Where did these come from?
[1771.47] They’re mine.
[1773.40] But where did you get
the money to buy them?
[1776.87] Leave it, don’t dig too deep.
[1779.27] Everything’s arranged now,
[1781.17] why are we discussing every little detail?
[1796.00] Whose bangles are these?
[1799.40] I just told Mother, these are mine.
[1805.87] Weren’t there enough sins already
that now you’ve started stealing too?
[1810.17] What do you mean I’ve started stealing?
[1817.17] My friend needed money,
so he was selling the bangles.
[1821.40] I took them from him,
I told him to take some money now
[1824.53] and I’ll pay the rest gradually.
[1826.67] But why do you need bangles?
[1833.03] I don’t believe a word you say anymore.
[1836.27] Go return them.
[1839.93] Hey,
[1841.07] If my son has bought bangles for his mother
[1844.73] and says he’ll pay for them slowly,
[1848.37] what’s the problem with that?
[1853.67] What your son is saying is not true.
[1862.27] He stole them.
[1864.40] You’ve made it a habit
to misjudge my son.
[1869.93] When he says he bought them,
he bought them.
[1877.00] And I like these bangles very much.
[1879.03] I’m keeping them.
[1881.13] Fine, son,
[1882.07] keep paying the money.
[1883.60] I’ll take them.
[1890.33] Mark my words,
[1891.97] one day you and your mother
will be sitting on the floor, crying.
[1919.93] I thought,
[1921.60] I thought maybe you would be
right somewhere.
[1923.97] But after coming here and
seeing all this, I realized
[1928.93] I made a huge mistake.
[1930.80] Ghaznavi, believe me.
He is lying,
[1932.77] Ghaznavi…
Ghaznavi, please.
[1940.03] Get lost, go from here!
[1942.23] Otherwise, I’ll do something to myself.
Go from her, leave!
[1945.67] Go!
[1946.47] Sister, please, just leave.
[1948.97] Will you take her life too?
Go from her.
[1955.63] There is still time, Father.
Kick her out of the house!
[1957.93] Otherwise, she’ll poison us all and kill us.
[1979.37] Eat something…
[1982.77] I don’t want to.
[1988.23] What will happen if you don’t eat?
[1994.17] What should I do, Mother?
[1999.63] I don’t understand what should I do.
[2005.40] I made one mistake and
I am facing such punishment.
[2017.17] Dear, if you have made a mistake then
you’ll have to suffer the consequences.
[2022.97] Now, see how long this punishment is for.
[2027.87] Sometimes the duration
of the punishment is less,
[2032.97] but sometimes,
[2035.27] the duration of the punishment
becomes so prolonged,
[2037.73] that the whole life is spent.
[2042.20] If you take one wrong step,
[2047.00] then generations after generations
suffer the consequences.
[2065.07] Fiza will never forgive me?
[2071.80] Only Fiza can tell.
[2075.63] Poor Fiza has suffered a lot.
[2087.13] She got divorced,
[2090.13] she lost her child,
and her family was broken.
[2103.17] And
[2105.00] Somewhere in all this,
