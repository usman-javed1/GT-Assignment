[20.12] Do you think that
[21.60] if we have given you the permission 
to take her for dinner,
[24.28] and to come home, 
that means we trust you?
[28.64] This is not true at all.
[30.24] Maybe you are forgetting that 
your sister is now my wife.
[34.64] Yes,
[36.56] but that doesn’t mean we trust you.
[40.76] You are insulting me.
[42.24] Then tolerate it.
[47.64] That poor thing is innocent,
[50.12] but she doesn’t know 
what is going on these days.
[57.28] People get married, 
get engaged,
[61.00] and so much is happening 
in the guise of that.
[65.00] And we really don’t trust you because
[68.88] what if you say no to taking her from here?
What if you come and say this is not possible?
[72.08] Then what will we do?
[73.28] What kind of a person are you?
[75.96] Are you not ashamed of saying such 
nasty things about your own sister?
[79.08] Hey, it is you who should be ashamed.
[81.08] Do you think I am stupid?
[85.12] By making the excuse of the dinner, 
you want to make her the limelight of hotels?
[88.64] Shut up.
[91.52] I have been listening to 
your nonsense for so long.
[97.76] Have a look.
[99.44] Your brother is saying such nasty things.
[101.12] He is such a disgusting man.
[102.48] -Whom did you call disgusting?
-Khizar?
[105.32] Leave him. 
Khizar?
[110.92] Get hold of your brother.
[113.04] And hats off to you. 
In fact, I’d rather salute you
[121.44] that you are tolerating this evil man.
[133.40] You feel so much pain for her, right?
[136.00] Take her with you.
[149.92] Get out.
[151.00] Get out.
[152.36] Go.
[154.56] Khizar? Khizar? Khizar?
[167.32] I would go to dinner. I would go to dinner.
I would go to dinner.
[178.64] Explain it to him,
[180.68] do you understand?
[182.56] I am watching everything.
[189.24] And what are you looking at my face
 while standing here? Yes?
[195.76] You’re here to watch the spectacle. 
Go from here.
[204.36] Here he comes.
[207.40] I would go to dinner.
[221.40] Here is your green tea, Baba Saeein.
[225.28] Live long, child.
[228.36] You take great care of everyone.
[242.08] Not just everyone,
[243.60] our daughter-in-law handles 
the whole mansion.
[251.32] Kashmala, the food was really tasty today.
[265.56] Thank you, Amma Saeein.
[267.68] Since I am the elder 
daughter-in-law of the mansion,
[270.56] I have to do everything 
according to your glory.
[279.72] Indeed. Thank you so much.
[288.32] Seeing everyone together here 
makes me feel so happy.
[307.40] You are right, Saeein.
[310.64] Today, it feels like our mansion is complete.
[314.92] There is just one thing missing.
[328.20] What is missing, mother?
[331.20] Now Dua and I are also with you.
[345.72] Our eyes yearn to see your offspring.
[365.48] Yes.
[367.96] Your Amma Saeein is right.
[384.88] After seeing your children,
[388.20] I will not be sad about dying.
[399.40] Baba Saeein, don’t say such things.
[401.96] Just get well soon.
[405.04] We will give you the good news soon.
[466.40] When I already told you that 
I gave them permission,
[470.36] then why did you mess up with him?
[473.12] Did I mess up with him?
[475.24] He was showing his fondness 
for being a policeperson.
[486.84] I know really well.
[489.00] I know you and him really well.
[498.44] Hey?
[499.48] Not even two days have passed 
since your sister’s wedding.
[502.48] Will you ruin her home?
[505.12] Yes, then let it be.
[514.88] Talk sensibly.
[516.40] I should talk sensibly.
[519.12] Not more than two days have passed 
since we got into a relationship with him.
[522.12] And in this house, while standing here,
[524.40] he abused me.
[525.72] He said I am disgusting.
[527.48] And it doesn’t make any difference
 to you people?
[531.44] It would have made some difference.
[533.28] It would have made some
difference had I believed
[535.76] that you treated him nicely.
[544.36] But no.
[546.04] Hey, he is not mad
[548.00] that he would stand here 
and call you disgusting.
[553.68] Okay.
[555.44] Okay, now it means you are saying
 that it’s my mistake.
[557.44] It can be yours.
[558.40] No, no. What do you mean it can be yours?
[559.80] Say that it’s my mistake. 
It is one hundred percent my mistake.
[562.64] Sarfaraz,
[564.20] don’t drag the matter.
[566.00] Okay, you want me to praise someone 
who came to this house and misbehaved with me.
[570.84] You want me to unite heaven 
and Earth while praising him.
[574.36] This is what you want, right?
[580.44] You shouldn’t have come 
in front of him.
[587.56] If you didn’t come here, 
that matter wouldn’t get worse.
[592.84] Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[594.28] That means whatever would happen 
in this house will be done as per his will.
[601.20] Tell me one thing.
[602.32] You are giving away 
your daughter to him.
[603.96] Are you also transferring 
this house to his name?
[609.88] Don’t misbehave, Sarfaraz.
[612.60] I am not misbehaving.
[613.80] I just realized today 
what my status is in this house.
[625.00] And look at her.
[627.04] He insulted her brother.
[629.04] But she is shedding tears 
for the one who is offended.
[635.64] For God’s sake, spare someone.
[639.68] Look at her. 
How worried she is!
[642.20] She just got married and 
you created this scene.
[645.28] What scene?
[646.80] You people have no idea 
what a person he is.
[656.32] I mean, what is her relationship with him? Yes?
[661.16] He said to me that you are an evil man.
[664.16] And that she is compelled to live with you.
[666.60] What does your daughter-in-law 
have anything to do with him?
[672.60] Anyone other than Khizar would have
 said the same thing.
[678.80] This is really Sister-in-law’s courage 
that she is tolerating you.
[680.88] You don’t even care about Sister-in-law’s honour,
nor your sister’s house.
[688.60] You are good for no relation, Brother. 
You are good for nothing.
[691.68] Amazing! Are you listening to her?
[693.88] Yes?
[694.68] I mean, she just got married two days ago 
and she is abusing me?
[698.56] But okay.
[699.52] Okay, do whatever you want to do.
[702.72] But if he comes to this house,
[705.16] I will treat him exactly like this.
[707.24] In fact, I would treat him 
even worse than this.
[708.76] Remember this.
[719.40] He will only stop after
ruining his sister’s house.
[724.04] What are you saying? 
Why are you scaring us?
[726.36] Hey, did you see his behavior?
[729.20] Ill-fated!
[761.28] Madam?
[787.88] Isn’t her heart full
[790.16] after entering Nosherwan’s life that now…
[793.04] Now she is here to set my heart on fire.
[796.36] She didn’t just come.
[798.16] In fact, Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein 
are pampering her with their love.
[804.84] Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein 
were asking her for children.
[809.00] The way Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein 
were asking her for grandchildren,
[813.80] I am also afraid
[819.24] that she has come permanently into Sir’s life.
[822.60] She will snatch your position.
[824.32] Nothing as such can happen.
[828.96] Nobody can take my place.
[832.60] I will kick her out of Sir’s life very soon.
[836.68] What will you do?
[840.08] Although she has come here
[843.28] She will not go back alive from here.
[851.76] I will not let her go back alive.
[879.92] He is distracted as you people came back.
[885.36] Otherwise, he was just talking 
about dying for so long.
[889.84] Don’t worry.
[892.16] Nothing will happen to Baba Saeein.
[903.04] I am just praying
[907.36] that may I die before him.
[918.48] That woman is so lucky
[922.00] whose husband buries her 
in her grave with his own hands.
[927.96] You love Baba Saeein so much, right?
[932.84] Pretty much.
[937.64] Just the way you love Nosherwan.
[947.84] You do, right?
[950.96] Yes.
[954.32] Just keep loving him like this.
[963.20] Don’t ever cheat him.
[969.36] Nosherwan deeply loves you now.
[977.12] That is why
[979.28] he didn’t even get trapped in Farah’s trap.
[985.56] -Amma Saeein, Farah…
-We all know.
[989.44] We know she has a son,
[993.56] and her husband didn’t even divorce her.
[996.48] Who told you?
[998.36] Ghaznavi?
[1001.28] We do live away from you.
[1004.44] But Saeein does keep an eye 
on his son’s friends and enemies.
[1009.60] He knows it all.
[1019.40] When he is here,
[1021.28] no one can do anything to you.
[1026.04] I heard about Brother Zawar.
[1031.08] I am so sorry to hear that.
[1033.40] How enemies shot him!
[1038.00] Yes.
[1040.52] But we also didn’t spare a single 
person from our enemy’s family.
[1053.68] Only their distant relatives ran away 
and saved their lives.
[1064.28] They still get together and try to attack.
[1073.84] But then they get defeated badly
 and go missing.
[1084.16] Anyway,
[1086.68] it is very late at night.
[1088.84] You should go to sleep too.
[1092.68] We will have a chat in the morning.
[1094.40] I have got your room ready.
[1097.68] Yes, Amma Saeein.
[1100.64] You will go to your room yourself
[1102.28] or shall I call Pirah to 
take you to your room?
[1104.60] No, no. I will go myself.
[1108.64] Live long.
[1109.76] Go take some rest. Good night.
[1113.28] Goodbye.
[1183.60] You are so stubborn.
[1186.32] After all that happened, 
you are still with Nosherwan.
[1194.28] Do you know? 
I am amazed sometimes.
[1197.72] I also feel pity.
[1203.56] When you are not happy here,
[1206.64] you should marry someone else
[1209.40] and go somewhere.
[1210.84] Because that is what 
everyone else wants too.
[1213.12] What are you saying?
[1216.08] I am Nosherwan’s first wife.
[1218.96] Who is his first wife and who is second,
[1221.60] what difference does it make?
[1227.60] What actually makes the difference is
[1230.24] to whom Ghaznavi gave this status.
[1233.64] You are so proud of this, aren’t you?
[1241.32] Dua, this pride will be broken one day.
[1247.48] By attacking me,
[1249.36] and creating misunderstandings between us…
[1253.80] You have tried this so many times.
[1261.68] If this is what makes you happy,
[1264.80] then you can try one more time.
[1275.52] Kashmala, I really want to see you happy.
[1280.12] You should get married to someone else
 and live a happy peaceful life.
[1284.80] Keep these useless suggestions 
of yours to yourself.
[1292.64] Time will tell
[1295.52] who will get what.
[1318.48] It’s you.
[1320.40] I was scared.
[1323.72] I was coming to see you
[1330.12] that what if you go missing
in the mazes of this mansion?
[1344.92] Even if I go missing somewhere,
[1348.00] these doors and walls are familiar to you.
[1352.96] They will tell me about your whereabouts.
[1365.40] I have this idea about your love.
[1375.36] That even if I go missing somewhere,
[1379.00] you will find me.
[1389.56] How did you find this mansion?
[1391.04] Very nice.
[1393.00] Very glorious.
[1399.56] Far away from the noises of the city.
[1402.48] Way bigger than my house.
[1405.32] This is our family symbol.
[1407.76] My grandfather built this.
[1415.44] Do you like living here?
[1420.36] With you, anywhere.
[1441.04] Come.
[1472.80] Why is Khizar so worried about you?
[1476.40] Hmm?
[1478.28] What is going on between you two?
[1481.80] What are you saying?
[1487.12] He is Sumbul’s husband. 
He is respectable to me.
[1489.64] He is nothing for you. 
Do you understand?
[1493.16] What are you doing? 
Leave me.
[1497.24] What kinds of things do you say? 
What types of things do you think about?
[1501.68] I fall from my own grace 
when you say such things.
[1505.56] Do you think I am as such?
[1507.24] That with the husband of 
my sister-in-law, I will…
[1513.80] The saddest thing is that
[1516.36] you say what I cannot even think of.
[1560.64] Sumbul?
[1561.76] What happened?
[1563.56] Why are you crying?
[1565.80] Khizar is not picking up my call.
[1570.08] Then leave him a text.
[1572.04] Maybe he is busy and 
didn’t see while working.
[1575.32] He will call back.
[1577.36] It can never happen that 
he gets this busy
[1580.88] that he doesn’t reply 
to my calls or messages.
[1584.16] How Brother behaved with him yesterday,
[1586.28] he is very angry because of that.
[1590.24] Okay, don’t worry.
[1593.24] Everything will be fine.
[1595.20] How will it get better?
[1596.92] As long as Brother is here, 
how can it get better?
[1601.12] If crying would make it better, 
then I will also start crying with you.
[1604.48] So that everything gets better. Hmm?
[1607.16] What should I do, Sister-in-law?
[1610.04] Be courageous.
[1611.80] How can I be courageous?
[1614.24] He is not talking to me.
[1616.88] Brother shouldn’t have done this.
[1621.20] Your brother shouldn’t have
 done a lot of things.
[1624.16] But he is doing them all, right?
[1626.60] Father is here, right?
[1629.44] You will see, Father will explain it to Khizar.
[1633.08] It will be better if you don’t talk to him for now.
[1635.04] He is angry. Once his anger vanishes,
[1637.60] then you can talk to him, please.
[1640.32] He will not talk to me.
[1642.24] He is of a very different nature.
[1645.56] Brother did so wrong. He did so wrong.
[1648.68] Okay but it is done now, isn’t it?
[1650.88] Sit down here.
[1652.36] Sit down.
[1653.84] Don’t cry this much.
[1656.20] It will be done.
[1657.00] Solutions do come out of 
the conversations. Okay?
[1661.00] You used to laugh all the time. 
What happened to you?
[1750.96] Give me some water.
[1771.28] Thank you.
[1775.92] You must be satisfied seeing me 
better than before.
[1784.24] No matter how much I thank God, 
it will be less.
[1788.00] Otherwise, you scared me off.
[1793.24] I am still scared.
[1798.36] Of what?
[1801.72] Kashmala.
[1806.32] You are right.
[1811.44] Seeing Kashmala’s mental state,
[1814.76] I sometimes get scared a lot as well.
[1818.32] Explain it to her
[1821.20] that she should stop waiting for Nosherwan.
[1829.36] And she should get herself mentally 
prepared for her new voyage.
[1836.88] What do you think
[1839.04] I didn’t explain it to her?
[1842.20] I did it several times.
[1844.44] Not by considering her my daughter-in-law,
[1846.44] but as my daughter.
[1848.44] But she doesn’t listen to me or agree with me.
[1851.24] She cries whenever I talk to her.
[1855.04] She is being stupid.
[1858.68] She will be at a loss by doing this.
[1867.56] Okay don’t get worried by thinking about this.
[1870.80] Get some rest.
[1872.28] Let me go make soup and oatmeal
for you with my own hands.
[1876.00] Hmm?
[1889.88] After asking about Kashmala’s consent,
[1892.40] choose someone else for her.
[1894.04] Nothing will be gained from 
this relationship except for loss.
[1896.84] Kashmala’s deprivations
[1899.96] are driving her to take revenge from me.
[1904.40] The attack that was done on me and 
my group was done by Kashmala.
[1916.16] She conspired to kill my wife.
[1921.76] Believe me, Baba Saeein.
[1925.20] If someone else did this act apart from her,
[1930.00] I would have answered them by now.
[1932.92] But since Kashmala is related to this mansion,
[1936.32] that is why once again, 
my hands are tied.
[1939.88] To get her out of this jealousy 
and enmity, it is necessary
[1944.56] that you make arrangements 
for her somewhere else.
[1959.52] It is so pretty.
[1964.60] -What is going on?
-Come, Nosherwan.
[1968.00] Thanks to the Almighty
[1970.36] that your Baba Saeein is feeling 
much better now.
[1974.12] Yes, indeed.
[1975.84] He will be even better in a couple of days.
[1981.48] Let me do it today.
[2005.68] Thank you.
[2012.36] Both our daughters-in-law are very sensible.
[2024.52] And we have seen Dua’s prudence in Karachi.
[2039.16] As you both came back here
[2041.20] and that all of you are together, 
your Baba Saeein is very happy.
[2050.56] Yes.
[2051.92] Well, do try to take great care
 of him when we go.
[2059.24] Why?
[2060.28] Are you people going back?
[2063.20] Yes, Amma Saeein.
[2064.40] I have a couple of really important 
meetings in Karachi.
[2067.32] When will you go? 
You are still here for tonight, right?
[2069.88] Yes, yes. We are here for tonight.
[2071.32] We will leave in the morning.
[2085.84] By the way, I was thinking that 
ever since Dua came here,
[2088.44] she didn’t go out anywhere. 
Neither did she go on a tour.
[2092.12] So, let’s do one thing. 
You can go if you want to.
[2095.36] We will have Dua stay here 
with us in the mansion.
[2101.56] No, Amma Saeein.
[2103.04] Don’t be so cruel.
[2104.52] It will be really difficult for me.
[2113.16] Why?
[2114.72] Don’t we have any rights over Dua?
[2123.32] That’s it. I have decided.
[2126.08] Dua will now stay with us in the mansion.
[2129.16] You will also keep visiting 
the mansion with this excuse.
[2136.12] As you say, Amma Saeein.
[2138.40] Really?
[2141.36] Then I will have to shift Karachi’s office here.
[2153.76] Wow.
[2155.60] The same Nosherwan who used to 
talk about running away from the mansion,
[2160.24] today he is talking about 
shifting the office here.
[2193.56] Pirah?
