This is your third call in so long. Because I am worried about you. I feel you are not well. I am fine. You tell me, how do I make you believe? When you are fine, I get the vibes myself, and I don’t get them right now. Even the party is really boring
 I am leaving from here. Fine, come. When you are in front of me, you will believe me. Right? You be ready,
 we will go somewhere. Right now? Yes, right now. When you are with me, then I don’t realize 
how time passes. Fine. How are you, Ghaznavi? Did someone pressure you to do this? Don’t be afraid. Give us your statement fearlessly. Why don’t you 
agree to what he says? Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz. I will not let you leave 
the home and go. For God’s sake, don’t go. Whatever is happening with me, is because of you. Leave me. Sister-in-law! Did you fall yourself or did someone push you on purpose? I had fallen myself. Don’t be afraid, Fiza. We are all with you and the law will protect you. I am speaking the truth. I fell myself. Fine. We hope you are not lying to us. But we have recorded your statement. We will go now. Girls like you hit your foot 
with an axe yourself. Hey, I was going to call you. Hey, we will go for 
the outing some other time, not today. No problem. I got ready when you asked me. If you don’t want to go, then we won't go. Yes, I don’t know, I have a headache. You have a headache? I will bring the medication. Yes. I will rest. Please, no one should disturb me. How are you, Ghaznavi? You have not changed at all. You are handsome just like earlier. Say something. What do I say? Ask me how I am. What is the need to as you? I can see it. One should not judge the state 
of the heart by outward appearances. Neither have I changed,
 nor my love. You cheated me and went away. I cheated you? I told you everything 
honestly and went. You are the one
 who left me and went. I am here now. Hah, you are forgetting, you are married. Why am I talking to you? Listen to me once. I ended that marriage. I made a hasty decision to
 forget your unfaithfulness. But, I ended everything 
as soon as I realized it. There is no point in all this, I am married now. Your will wasn’t part of that marriage. You were forced to accept it, and you have admitted 
this in front of me. I admit this in front of you even today. But the marriage I am talking about is the one I have 
now done with my choice. Marriage? Love marriage? No. You… You are joking with me, right? No. Ghaznavi, I am your choice. How can you change 
your choice so soon? Soon? I think you are forgetting, what you are calling early, it has been ages since it happened. Still I am not willing to accept this. Our love was not so weak that you forget it easily, and a man doesn’t forget 
his first love so easily. I am your first love and you cannot forget me so easily. I had said no one should disturb me. You, leave. Does my presence also disturb you? I didn’t mean that. You have a headache, right? Take the medicine, have tea, and you will see how the pain disappears. A man doesn’t forget
 his first love so easily. I am your first love and you cannot forget me so easily. Here you go. I will take it in a while. Eat it, then have hot tea, you will really like it. Did something happen? No. Nothing happened. What happened? Are you worried? I have never seen you
 this worried ever before. Before today, even my past hadn’t walked
 in front of me like this. What happened? Nothing, maybe I am tired. I will rest. I am going to talk to Baba Saeein 
about your and my relationship. Really? Really? But if he doesn’t agree, then? Still, no one can
 separate me from you. Promise? I promise and you know how much I live up to my promises. A man doesn’t forget 
his first love so easily. Come quickly, we are getting late. Put it on this side. Quickly. Quickly. Hey, where are you going? Won't you have breakfast? No, I am not in the mood. Eat something. You have it, please. I will meet you in the evening. Jaffar. Yes? What happened yesterday? Yesterday? Yes, yesterday. Nothing at all. Are you speaking the truth? Why will I lie to you? I am getting late, sir might get upset. I will go now. Did something happen? No. Nothing happened. What happened? I have never seen you 
this worried ever before. Nothing, I think I am tired. Fiza, child, you should have stayed in 
the hospital for a few more days. You really need to rest. What will I do by resting? My loss will not be repaid. Child, your health 
is also really important. I will go home and rest. Fine, then, come with me. I will go to my in-laws home. Don’t insist child. If you go to our place, I will be able to take
 care of you better. When the one I had to protect, is no more, then what will you care for? After all, when I have to go there, then, what will going to you 
for a few days do? After all, Papa doesn’t like me coming home. Hey, child, don’t take what 
he says to your heart. You know his temperament, he is like this. I know. I know everything. This accident has given me a big experience. Okay. Fiza, child, why did you not
 tell the police the truth? Your in-laws and your husband were
 pressurizing you to not give birth to this child? If the bag is packed, then call him. I want to go home. I will see. Hello. Hello. Tell your staff to at least 
bring me to your room. To my room? Yes, I am in your office. Take care of it yourself, please. Okay fine, I will ask from the reception myself. Excuse me, where is Nosherwan’s room? Yes? Take her and bring her to my room. I will just bring her. Please, come on. Sure. Sure, please. Hello. Hi. You are surprised seeing me as if you have seen a ghost. No, actually, I was not expecting you 
to come here like this. But, now, I have come. Hmm. Won't you ask me to sit? Please have a seat. Tea or coffee? You know my likes and dislikes well. The likes and dislikes of a person
 change over so many years. Neither did I change, nor my choice. One black coffee and one coffee with milk. You haven’t forgotten anything. I don’t want to remember. You didn’t even change your number. Had I known you would call 
and reach out like this, then I might have changed it. You cannot change. You didn’t change your number, because you had hopes that I would contact you at one time. One should not keep 
such high expectations. Earlier, I just had faith, but after meeting you, and seeing you, my faith has become stronger. Even today, you only love me. This is what you think, not me. A woman’s heart never lies
 in the matters of love. A life spared is worth 
a hundred thousand. It was so difficult to 
get them discharged. I’ve clearly told them that I don’t have enough money
 to cover hospital expenses. Yes, so did the right thing. What is the need to spend 
so much money on her? The doctor had made complete
 arrangements to get us in trouble. But Fiza acted smartly and she didn’t give
 a statement against you. Yes, so she should have made
 a statement against me. I too had announced my decision. Have you gone mad? You would have had to visit 
the police station for no reason. If I had to visit the police station, then she would have stayed at 
her parents’ home all her life. This is not the time to be emotional, it is time to act sensibly. I don’t know what 
the point of all this is now. Hey, why is there no point? It is a recent incident. Right now, her parents became quiet, but still, she is their daughter. if Fiza gives a statement against you then we will be in trouble. I would suggest that right now, take care of her. Fix your behavior towards her. Even if you do it for show, show love to her, son. Mama, I won’t be able to do all this. You will have to do this. I don’t know where
 Papa has trapped me. Hey. Oh God, how do I make this boy understand? Fiza, how long will you cry like this? Even I am really sad about
 whatever happened. Why will you be sad? This is what you wanted. Hey, I said everything in my anger. I had no such intentions. Look, I know that you have been really
 hurt because of me. And, I am really regretting it too. Your regret will not fill my empty arms. My child left the world 
before coming into my arms. But Fiza, don’t worry. I am with you. God will give us another child, and this time, I promise you that I will really take good care of you. Please. Please, get a grip on yourself. Everything will be fine. This is good that Sister 
Marium paid the committee. How many more 
committees of hers are left? This is the eighth one we took, right? Yes. So, two are left. Two are left. Now I pray to God 
we get a rickshaw soon. It is also really hot. Yes. Fehmida. Isn’t that our Dua? See. Hey, this is my Dua. Dua. Dua. She blocked my number? She took the money and she didn’t even do the work. I will not leave Zunaira. Yes, go ahead. Greetings, madam. What do you want? Tell me why did you call? Farah has come back into sir’s life. What are you saying? How do you know? Both of them were together 
at the party yesterday. The news is confirmed, right? Did you see both of them together? I saw them myself, and I am WhatsApping you the proof. Well done. You did a good
 thing gathering proof. Send it. Immediately send it. My senses were
 stunned when they heard that Ghaznavi had 
given you my place. But the ground will 
slip from under your feet when you find out that Ghaznavi’s old love has returned. Mama. Be quiet, Mama. How long will you cry like this? Hey, my Dua. My Dua passed in front of my eyes and I couldn’t meet her. Did you see her properly, was that Sister? Yes, it was my Dua. How can my eyes deceive me? You should have stopped her. She was sitting in the car. I tried. The car left before
 I could call out to her. But where did sister get a car from? I don’t know. That’s what I am worried about too. Hey, what sort of people
 is my daughter trapped with? There was one more car, it had people with guns sitting in it. Mama, hearing this, even I am really worried for sister. God knows what condition
 my daughter would be in. My heart is exploding. What can we do other 
than get worried, Mama? No one will even 
be ready to help us. That’s what I am worried about. Papa doesn’t even 
want to see sister’s face. His anger towards sister 
Fiza hasn’t even cooled down. I don’t know what sort of fate 
my daughters have been born with. They don’t have comfort in their fate. Get a grip on yourself. Don’t get disheartened like this. Mama, here, drink some water. That’s it. Don’t cry. The likes and dislikes of a person
 change over so many years. Neither did I change, nor my choice. Earlier, I just had faith, but after meeting you, and seeing you, my faith has become stronger. Even today, you only love me. Hey, you are back. Yes, I had come. Did you come from your shopping? Yes. I didn’t feel like it at all. But since it was your order, so I had to go. You did good, after all, you would
 have gotten bored alone. I can wait for you. I know. What happened? Is everything okay? Hmm? You are hiding something from me. No, what will I hide from you? why do you feel this way? I don’t know. But, I feel like you are caught in some worry. A man doesn’t forget
 his first love so easily.
