We've changed so many doctors, but our daughter's health hasn't improved. The doctor has advised some tests, but the facilities aren't available here.
We'll have to go to Karachi. Yes, so, we shouldn’t delay, if that’s the thing. I will make arrangements for you people
to go to Karachi, immediately. Saeein, won't you go? No, there is some important work here, and then, even my health doesn’t allow it. You go with Kashmala. Then, Nosherwan is also there,
you will not feel my absence. Baba Saeein, you were not well,
you have just gotten better. If we go like this, then
we will remain worried for you. Let’s get Mizna checked in a local hospital. I won't tolerate any kind of negligence
when it comes to our daughter. Okay. But, I cannot leave you and go like this. Why are you talking like a child? Right now, nothing is more important
than our daughter’s health. Nothing will happen to our daughter.
She will be fine, and Kashmala will take
the children to Karachi. Nosherwan and Dua are there, they will take care of them,
and they will handle everything. I will stay with you. Kashmala will need you there. So, we will stay in touch, but I cannot leave you and go. Baba Saeein, Amma Saeein is right. I will also have peace of mind about
the mansion if Amma Saeein is with you. I… I will take the children to Karachi, alone. You people have started
to consider me a child. Fine, as all of you wish. I will call Nosherwan, you start your preparations. Sure. When you know that my fate is so good, then why do you make such efforts? Kashmala, everyone in this house
loves you so much, they care for you so much, but you... Only you. I don’t have a problem with anyone else. I only have a problem with you, and if you too leave Nosherwan’s life, then this hatred will also end. This wish of yours cannot be fulfilled. How are you? Sarfaraz. This is for you. What is this? The company has fired you. And the reason for it? The company no longer needs you. You can leave. I want to meet Ghaznavi. Hmmm. Come with me. He wants to meet you. Why does he want to meet me? What happened? Are you not happy with my work? You fired me. The company no longer needs you. Is there no need, or are you bringing personal
matters to the office? It would be better for you if you
stayed away from personal matters. Obviously, you are rich, you are powerful. You can do what you want. When you know,
then stay away. Yes, so I was far. Now, what do I do? Fate brought me close to Dua itself. Don’t take Dua’s name,
I am making you understand. What’s in the name? Although I know everything about her
like the back of my hand, but anyway... Look, you came into her life now. Fine, you impressed her with your wealth, but I had nothing. But despite that, my name was on her tongue. If you order me, then
I will kill him right now. Wow. Wow. Amazing. You are more loyal than
the king himself. Fine. Back then she was not aware
of your true nature. Yes, but that doesn’t make a difference. The truth is, she came in my share first. If you even say a word about Dua, I will empty all the bullets down your throat. You leave him, sir.
I will take care of him. Pick him up and throw him out. Out. If he is seen around the office
in the future, shoot him. I want to forget,
but he is in front of me. I want that…. What do you want? I want him to suffer a painful death. And Fiza? Have you thought
what will happen to her? I was thinking about her for so long. I was quiet for so long,
thinking about her. Get out! Even if I see you near
this office in the future, then I will shoot you in the chest. Understand? Remember that I will not leave you people. I will make each one of you
cry tears of blood. Out. Forgive me, daughter Fiza. You have truly been subjected
to a lot of injustice. I will not influence any decision of yours, and neither will I ask you to forgive Sarfaraz. Hey, he is your criminal. You can punish him as you want. The real sadness is that my son
was never worthy of you. Uncle, I have no complaints against you. Believe me… believe me, I was not aware
of this sin of Sarfaraz. I was not aware. Hey, if possible… if possible, forgive me, Brother Aslam. Hey, why are you making me
a sinner Brother Naseer? Get a grip on yourself. Here I am, in my old age, having to endure humiliation
at the hands of my son. I should just die. Hey, I am also your criminal Brother Aslam. You can give whatever punishment you want, to that criminal,
with regards to your daughters. I… I will never stand up in his support, ever. I will never. No. No. Brother Naseer, this is Fiza’s decision. She will decide and we will support her. If she wants Sarfaraz punished,
then I will get him punished. I will support every decision
of daughter Fiza. Yes, we will support every decision
of yours, daughter Fiza. See, she has become completely lost. She has become completely lost. She cannot tolerate the shock. She is unable to tolerate the shock. She is feeling somewhat
better than before, but we can only be sure
once the reports come in. Yes, thank you, doctor. Greetings. Greetings. How is Mizna, now? Yes, she is better. The fever has gone down. Thank God. I got worried that
this little doll was unwell. What do the doctors say? They are saying the reports
will come tomorrow, they will decide after that. You people have been here for so long. If you want, then you can go home
and rest. I will stay here with Mizna. No, I am here. Kashmala, I think you should go. We will have to stay here for two days. I am with Mizna. I will not go anywhere leaving
Mizna in this condition. I will remain worried for her. How can I go home and rest? If you people want to go,
then go ahead. I will stay here. I am telling you, I am here. So, you don’t need to worry. You can leave. As long as you're here,
I feel reassured. But I will still worry about Mizna. After all, I'm her mother. Only a woman who has been
a mother can truly understand what it means to be a mother. Sir, the doctor is calling you. See, this soup is so good. Now, Mizna is feeling better. If Mizna drinks a little more soup, then she will get even better. A little. A little. Very little. Come on, one more sip? A little. Greetings Amma Saeein. Greetings, Grandma. Greetings. Live long. My doll is fine. Huh? How are you now, my love? I am absolutely fine, Grandma. Nosherwan, what do the doctors say? The reports are all clear. The doctors have called her
for a routine check-up in two days. They have discharged her right now. You gave me really good news. Yes, thank God. Or else, I was really worried. I know. Till our daughter doesn’t completely recover, you have to take special care of her. Don’t worry at all, Amma Saeein. All of us will take a lot of care of Mizna. Goodbye. Thank God. Bring water. Mama. Sumbul. Bring water. Hey, someone bring me water. Hey, bring water. Mama. Yes, Brother. Water. I have called out six hundred times
to bring water. Fiza has spoiled you by
following your every command. She's completely messed up your mind. Now will you shout at your mother
and sister like this? At least, I didn’t have to tell her, everything was done on time. Here, the throat dries, asking for things,
but no one listens. No one does my work. So, bring her back if she comes. Mama, look, my mind is already
in a whirl today, I'm really stressed out, and now you're giving me
all this talk on top of it. I should go and bring her back Okay fine,
I will not say such things. Tell me, did you find a job? I didn’t. I didn’t find a job. I am just giving interviews. Did you find a job or not? Your father’s shop has been rented out, and now we’ll have a fixed
income coming from there. How will we manage with such little money? It will be really difficult for me. It is really important for you to find a job. I am trying, what else do I do?
Do I hang upside down? What else do I do? Hey, so why are you getting upset like this? What is wrong? Take care of this file of mine, I have an interview again tomorrow. And listen, I am hungry. Bring food in the room,
along with raita and salad. I shouldn’t have to ask you a hundred times. Bring it now. This boy has so many tantrums. It was just Fiza who was tolerating this boy.
Oh God. Oh God. Now go, give him food or he will start screaming again. Hey, I was looking for you. I have heard Nosherwan has
put this big home in your name. Hmm? Yes, you have heard it right. Oh wow, what else have you made him
put in your name? Tell me. Ghaznavi gave me his name. He gave himself to me. That is enough for me. Oh, I had an idea about this. When the incident with
Sarfaraz occurred, Nosherwan didn’t utter a single word. And your sister left her home and
came to stay at her parents’ home. Such a big enmity was created. Obviously, she couldn’t tolerate it
either that her husband, Sarfaraz, was once your boyfriend
and who knows what else. But you’ve certainly cast some sort
of spell on Nosherwan, haven’t you? What do you want to say? Meaning, my love,
I have come here now, so you start packing
your bags gradually. Okay? Because now I will live here,
and you will go from here. Nosherwan. Yes? What is the matter? Sit. Sarfaraz, don’t worry. You will not be at a loss talking to me. I want to talk to you about
something important. Yes? What is the matter? You didn’t mind me making you
sit in the car like this, right? Get to the point. You seem angry. Obviously, when you have to go around
aimlessly looking for a job, you get angry. Yes, after all, Ghaznavi fired you from the job. How do you know Ghaznavi? I even know you really well. Fiza’s husband, Dua’s ex-boyfriend. Is this much reference enough, Sarfaraz, or do you want more? Fine, I accept you know a lot about me, but why did you reach out to me? I want you to do something. Something very important. Okay, and why do you think
I will be of help to you? Because you are used to shortcuts. You enjoy shortcuts. You want to become rich overnight,
you want to be successful, and I… I can help you with this. I can make you rich and… and I will pay the price you want. And Sarfaraz, the matter doesn’t end here. It is possible that you will
get your old love back. Old love? Dua. Your old love. I never loved Dua, and now… if you ask me about now? I hate her now. Then let it be hatred. She humiliated you so badly
in front of the entire family, that you must want
to take revenge on her. And along with taking revenge, you will also have a lot of money. Can I ask why you want to be
so kind to me? Because in return for this kindness,
you will also do a kindness towards me. I... I want to remove Dua from my path, and I know, you can do this easily. You even know about Dua. What is your relationship with her?
Who are you? I… I am Nosherwan Ghaznavi’s first wife.
