[23.56] You contacted him?
[27.52] Did you contact Sarfaraz?
[35.08] We kept thinking that
you weren’t contacting him, he was.
[38.68] Today, we found out that it was you.
[46.00] What are you trying to do?
[51.36] One of your sisters has
already gotten divorced.
[57.48] Yours is also on the verge
of divorcing you.
[70.08] You people have dragged
my honor through the dirt.
[74.60] You have disgraced me
in front of the whole world.
[78.12] What do you want?
[79.56] Speak up.
[81.12] Do you want to kill me?
[83.20] Then give me poison and kill me.
[85.52] Give me poison.
[86.48] Dad, please don’t say that.
[88.88] Trust me and have faith
in what I’m saying.
[100.60] The people who tried to ruin my life,
[104.36] I will soon reveal their faces to you.
[114.56] But,
[115.64] but trust me, please.
[157.28] Brother Aslam.
[163.24] Brother Aslam,
[164.56] what are you doing here?
This isn’t even your neighborhood.
[169.36] I had some work.
[171.08] Okay, Brother Aslam,
[176.68] you’re so angry that
you won’t even greet me anymore.
[180.80] Have you people left any space
for peace to be sent your way?
[186.80] Brother Aslam,
[189.12] I feel so ashamed in front of all of you.
[192.08] I wanted to apologize to you,
[195.36] but I couldn’t gather
the courage to face you.
[203.32] By chance, you came
in front of me today,
[207.48] so I thought I’d apologize to you.
[215.24] With folded hands,
I ask for your forgiveness.
[224.16] Whatever Sarfaraz did is unforgivable.
[236.76] Dear Fiza is a very good girl,
[240.48] but I feel so ashamed
in front of her too that
[244.20] I couldn’t even go and apologize to her.
[247.60] How will you ask for forgiveness?
[249.28] And what are you going to apologize for?
Tell me that.
[253.92] Sarfaraz divorced Fiza…
[256.84] If it had just been about the divorce,
[261.36] maybe I could have forgiven you,
[264.44] but now Sarfaraz is after Dua's marriage.
[272.56] He's going around telling
the whole world that
[275.88] he will get Dua divorced from
Ghaznavi and marry her himself.
[278.96] Hey this, how can this even be possible?
[281.16] This is what has happened.
[283.92] Listen carefully,
[287.12] and make your son understand.
[290.60] Otherwise, I might end up killing him,
[294.16] and not even come to apologize to you.
[298.44] Brother Aslam.
[316.56] Mom, we’re just going out for a bit.
[319.48] What’s the problem?
[321.24] Every day, you both get ready
and head out somewhere.
[327.72] You spend the whole day
at the police station,
[329.80] and your wife is locked up in her room.
[335.24] When you come home in the evening,
[336.72] she puts on makeup,
ready to go out again.
[344.04] Is this the way to live
in respectable families?
[350.44] You have two young,
unmarried sisters in your house.
[353.76] Have you any shame?
[355.76] Holding your wife’s hand, off you go.
[361.16] Mom, Sumbul wanted to.
[363.88] I’ll just get her ice cream from somewhere
nearby and be back in half an hour.
[366.96] Is she a child that she just felt
like eating ice cream?
[370.48] And you just went along.
[374.40] Such frivolous things don’t suit
households with young sisters.
[381.24] Explain to her that
she should stay at home,
[383.28] no need to go anywhere.
[389.36] And stop lying around in the room all day,
breaking the bed.
[395.36] From tomorrow,
get involved in the household.
[397.56] Take care of the kitchen,
and cook meals.
[400.52] There’s no need to go out anywhere.
[402.72] Now go wash your hands and face.
[405.60] Sumbul.
[406.56] Sumbul…
[424.40] Put it on here properly, child.
[430.96] Why are you meeting Dua?
[434.92] We are both getting married, what else?
[439.16] Are you listening to what he's saying?
[445.84] Don’t you have any shame at all?
[449.96] What’s shameful about it?
[457.12] We’re getting married,
[458.80] and if she has no issue,
and I don’t either.
[462.56] Then what problem do you people have?
[471.64] I’ve made my decision
[473.36] that I will marry her,
[475.24] and I won’t change my mind.
[481.60] You’re seeing his actions, aren’t you?
[486.56] Did you hear what nonsense
he just spewed about a married woman?
[492.28] You just keep saying
bad things about my son.
[497.36] That girl is encouraging him.
[499.28] That’s the only reason
he’s saying such things.
[501.40] You’re still supporting him?
[506.16] Understand the gravity of the situation!
[508.60] The whole world will condemn us.
[511.00] He won’t marry Dua.
[512.92] I’ll make him understand.
[515.36] And are the girls of that house
the only ones left for my son?
[519.24] I curse those girls,
[523.52] and you’re always against my son.
[526.48] Other people's children
seem good to you,
[528.28] but your own child seems bad.
[530.68] Don’t blame me for this.
[533.16] All of this is the result of
your poor upbringing.
[538.40] If you had raised him well,
[540.72] I wouldn’t have to face
such disgrace in society.
[545.76] He has already ruined one girl’s life
[549.12] and is now set on ruining
another girl’s life.
[559.68] May God ruin these girls.
[563.72] They’ve made a spectacle out of my son.
[576.08] We thought you weren’t
the one contacting him, he was.
[580.00] But today we found out you were.
[581.72] One sister already divorced,
[583.36] and yours is also on the verge
of divorcing you.
[586.96] You people have dragged
my honor through the dirt.
[589.88] You have disgraced me
in front of the whole world.
[601.04] Mom, your tea.
[604.36] Mom,
[605.76] Mom,
[607.40] Mom,
[609.52] Mom!
[615.28] Mom!
[616.56] Mom!
[619.12] Mom!
[620.20] Mom!
[621.68] Sister!
[640.60] The patient’s blood pressure has spiked,
[646.24] and she has suffered a deep shock.
[648.12] We have treated her,
[650.24] but keep her away from
any stressful environment.
[659.32] If her blood pressure spikes again,
it could become a serious problem.
[662.92] Be careful.
[664.56] Yes.
[694.52] Come on, lie down carefully,
[696.60] don’t think about anything.
[707.84] Listen, this is all happening
because of you.
[716.52] Mom has reached this state
only because of you.
[723.88] If anything happens to my mother,
[726.32] I won’t spare you.
[731.52] You’ve caused my divorce,
[733.80] you’ve taken away my child,
[735.88] and now you want
to take my mother too?
[751.52] Until I decide something,
[755.12] you should stay confined to your room,
[757.48] understand?
[796.08] This is all happening because of you.
[799.00] Mom has reached this state
only because of you.
[802.32] If anything happens to my mother,
[804.80] I won’t spare you.
[878.88] Have you sent the things to the lands?
[881.40] The seasons have changed.
[883.88] I had told Jaffar,
[885.56] he must have sent it by now.
[886.64] Tea.
[913.12] No, I’m not in the mood.
[948.48] Nosherwan,
[952.40] what is all this?
[956.36] How long will you continue
to deny what we’re saying?
[965.92] When you already know
and understand that
[969.16] that girl is not sincere with you,
[972.40] then why don’t you leave her?
[983.60] We told you before
[986.36] that girls with good lineage and 
family backgrounds are entirely different.
[996.44] But you married her out of stubbornness.
[1000.04] And you’ve placed this stain
on your forehead for no reason.
[1011.56] Still, we respected her for
your peace of mind and gave her love,
[1023.84] but she turned out to be of
low character and ungrateful.
[1035.56] Why don’t you divorce her
and throw her out of your life?
[1040.96] I don’t want to talk about this, Baba Saeein.
[1048.20] I just need some time.
[1051.56] How much more time do you need?
[1054.48] The sooner you remove her from your life,
[1057.72] the sooner your suffering will end.
[1066.52] Enough!
[1069.12] I’ve finalized it,
[1071.76] you are giving her a divorce.
[1079.04] Either verbally divorce her
in front of her family
[1082.08] or if you say I can have
the documents drawn up.
[1084.68] No, Baba Saeein.
[1088.08] I will do whatever that needs to be
done regarding this matter myself.
[1098.00] You don’t need to worry.
[1115.48] Whatever he is doing is wrong.
[1120.28] We are worried about Nosherwan.
[1123.88] Just pray
[1126.64] that God grants peace to our son.
[1152.16] Speak, why did you call me?
[1155.84] I think we’re working together.
[1158.28] And I called to remind you that
the work hasn’t been completed yet.
[1163.36] Get to the point.
[1165.52] Has there been any progress
from Dua’s side?
[1167.68] Did she call?
[1168.84] Keep your nonsense to yourself.
[1173.84] Whether she called me or not,
[1176.04] I won’t give you any updates
anymore, understood?
[1180.40] When it’s time to give money,
you act like you’re giving charity,
[1183.60] but you never forget to ask for updates.
[1187.36] Don’t contact me anymore,
[1189.16] we are no longer working together.
[1190.56] Hey, I’ve already told you,
[1193.20] that once Dua’s divorce is finalized,
I’ll give you the money.
[1195.92] Why are you so greedy?
[1198.00] Yes,
[1199.48] I’m greedy, but less than you.
[1205.00] You better take care of yourself
[1206.88] because when Ghaznavi
finds out your true nature,
[1210.40] he may not divorce Dua, but he will
definitely divorce you immediately.
[1216.44] It’s in your best interest to maintain
good relations with me.
[1222.88] I want my money immediately,
transferred to my account. Understood?
[1227.48] And by the way,
I’m recording this call,
[1232.84] and this recording will
reach Ghaznavi right away.
[1240.28] Hey…
[1271.68] I don’t need Sarfaraz alive.
[1275.32] Don’t worry about the money,
[1277.48] you’ll get whatever price you ask for.
[1280.24] But this job needs to be done
as quickly as possible.
[1529.04] Our Zawar’s bride.
[1653.48] If I can take my husband’s life
to get Nosherwan,
[1662.04] then what are you Sarfaraz?
[1793.12] How much more time do you need?
[1796.24] The sooner you remove her from your life,
[1799.40] the sooner your suffering will end.
[1821.92] Call the lawyer.
[1825.20] What?
[1826.64] The lawyer?
[1831.84] I want to divorce Dua.
[1841.56] I…
[1876.80] Hey…
[1877.92] For…Forgive me, Ma’am.
[1881.40] Where are you rushing off to
in such a state of panic?
[1885.44] Ma'am,
[1887.56] I was just going for
an important task from Sir.
[1891.60] What kind of task of Saeein is so urgent
that you’re in such a hurry?
[1898.04] Sir asked me to get
the divorce papers signed.
[1905.76] Divorce?
[1906.72] Yes.
[1908.36] Sir is divorcing the younger madam.
[1923.64] And you’re telling me this news
like this, in such a state of panic?
[1932.84] This should have been shared with 
drums and celebration, Jaffar.
[1936.28] Now that you’re going out,
bring back a lot of sweets.
[1939.24] I’ll distribute them to everyone.
[1941.92] Yes, alright, as you wish.
[1945.36] Don’t forget.
[1957.36] I’m glad you came when I called.
[1961.84] The twists of fate have
brought me to a point
[1965.64] where every path leads me back to you.
[1971.52] I had to come to you.
[1976.12] It made me happy to know this.
[1981.12] Anyway,
[1984.00] should I bring something from here,
they have self-service,
[1985.88] tea or coffee?
[1988.84] Whatever you feel is right.
[1991.40] They have good coffee.
[1992.76] I’ll be back.
[2040.72] Just keep Dua trapped in your
web of love like this.
[2045.36] Nosherwan Saeein has called
the lawyer and told him
[2048.80] to draw up the divorce papers.
[2051.04] He is finally giving Dua a divorce.
[2053.76] We will succeed in our mission
very soon and you,
[2056.64] you will get all of your money.
[2104.16] Should I get anything else?
[2105.12] No, no, I’m okay.
[2106.32] Are you sure?
[2111.20] Drink it.
