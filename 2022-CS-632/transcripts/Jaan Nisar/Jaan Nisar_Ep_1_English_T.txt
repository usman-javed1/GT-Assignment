[122.07] I am Nosherwan Ghaznavi.
[125.30] Baba and Amma Saeen’s beloved son.
[128.10] Brother Zawar’s life.
[130.67] Who did what he
 wanted since childhood;
[138.73] I fulfilled every desire,
[141.07] and made every
 impossible thing possible.
[153.00] But there also came a time,
[155.23] when I had to compromise 
on my preferences.
[160.10] I had to live a life that
 I didn’t even think of.
[164.10] Only for the sake of 
the happiness of my own.
[168.20] I believe that life often brings
 a person to a point,
[172.60] where they have a well in front 
and a pit behind them.
[176.53] But the trials of relationships
[177.60] push us into such deep 
quagmires from which,
[180.50] even if we wish to escape, we cannot.
[184.93] It's not us passing life;
[186.53] rather, life is passing us.
[189.13] And escaping from such a life 
is not possible even if we desire it.
[240.87] Dua.
[249.13] What are you doing?
[250.87] Is this the behavior of 
a girl from our home?
[260.53] Where is this sound 
of music coming from?
[262.33] Papa.
[264.00] Papa?
[265.83] We are dead. Turn it off.
[267.40] Huh?
[267.83] Turn it off immediately.
[277.60] Greetings.
[283.03] Where was the sound of 
music coming from?
[287.13] Not at all.
[291.33] What are you hiding?
[297.43] Show me.
[300.10] Show me!
[307.27] Oh God,
[308.53] how did this damned box?
[310.90] In my home? How?
[314.43] How did it come to this home?
[318.10] I bought it from the scrap seller.
[320.23] Where did you get the money from?
[321.90] I sold the magazines…
[323.70] Magazines?
[327.07] You sold magazines?
[328.63] Meaning all sorts of indecent content?
[332.20] Magazines also come to this house?
[334.20] Hey, why did you not slap her ten times and stop her?
[338.47] Mama had stopped me.
[339.47] She scolded me a lot.
[340.13] She scolded me a lot.
[341.03] Hey, God damn it.
[342.87] Music is being played in 
the home of Akram’s son.
[346.30] Indecent magazines 
are being brought here.
[348.40] And the neighbors are listening.
[350.07] No, I mean,
[351.70] I made a mistake. Sorry.
[352.53] Hey, you made a mistake…
[360.10] All this is happening because of 
you going to college and university.
[363.67] Yes,
[364.73] this education is spoiling you.
[369.43] It is over.
[370.60] She will not go to college
 and university from today.
[381.33] No, no, forgive her.
[384.87] Nothing like this will ever
 happen after today.
[390.13] Papa, sorry.
[392.30] I made a mistake.
[393.50] I will not do this again.
[394.73] Don’t stop my education.
[395.80] This won't happen again.
[398.10] It will never happen again.
[399.93] If it does,
[401.87] then I will bury you all one by one,
[405.07] and commit suicide myself.
[413.60] Why do you do this?
[493.47] Do you know the consequences of 
stopping me in the way, Dilawar?
[497.40] Hey, I have to talk to you.
[501.80] Like this, on the road?
[504.30] Whether it is a road or a mountain,
[506.60] I have to talk right now.
[510.70] Nosherwan Ghanznavi decides when
 and whom he has to talk to.
[523.80] You have one minute.
[526.23] After one minute,
[527.00] my guards will pull the trigger,
[528.43] then don’t blame me.
[532.33] Did you not hear
[534.07] what Saeen said to you?
[538.00] If bullets are fired from that side,
[539.87] they will also be fired
 from this side as well.
[543.13] There will be bloodshed,
[545.70] and I don’t want that.
[553.43] So, I will leave right now, and
[555.20] I will also allow you to leave.
[558.43] The next meeting will be at my home.
[562.03] You will come yourself.
[566.43] Dilawar, maybe you have
 no idea how costly
[571.60] calling me against 
my will can be for you.
[578.67] Let’s go, man.
[598.80] Saeen, I had told you
[601.27] not to go alone and take me with you,
[604.20] but you said no to me.
[607.20] When did that stop you, Jaffar?
[610.03] You came here following me.
[614.13] What could I do, Saeen?
[616.10] God forbid,
[617.07] had something happened
 to you today,
[619.70] I wouldn’t have been able
 to forgive myself all my life.
[668.97] You've ruined the
 minds of your daughters.
[671.23] You couldn’t even give birth to a son.
[672.93] Is this their upbringing?
[674.77] Hey, your daughters are dancing.
[676.93] Akram Shahab's granddaughter.
[678.73] You've kept a radio in the house.
[680.47] They're dancing.
[681.67] They are not ashamed at all.
[685.07] I feel like choking everyone to death.
[687.07] Get lost from here.
[710.60] Hey.
[717.03] What is it now?
[717.90] Has papa left?
[721.13] He left.
[723.20] Okay listen,
[724.83] what is Mama doing?
[726.13] She is crying
[726.93] after hearing what Papa said.
[728.37] I didn’t want that.
[730.33] Dua, you are not new in this home.
[733.37] When you are aware
 of Papa’s temperament.
[735.93] So, don’t give him
 such an opportunity.
[738.17] He just wants an opportunity
[739.67] to remind Mama of everything 
from the past and present.
[742.43] Why do you put Mama’s life in 
difficulty by doing such stupidity?
[745.13] What did I do?
[746.90] I had just bought a radio.
[748.43] And because of that one radio,
[750.37] Papa has asked Mama to make 
you quit your university,
[753.77] along with taunting her 
for not giving birth to a son.
[755.70] And if she makes you quit university,
[757.77] then these few moments
[758.97] of freedom you get from
 this imprisonments,
[761.00] even they will be snatched.
[764.33] And if you do anything wrong again,
[767.00] then Papa will put a seal 
on this decision of his.
[768.97] Okay, fine.
[770.13] Why are you scaring me?
[771.60] I will be careful.
[773.83] Listen,
[775.20] come to Mama with me.
[777.03] Put in a good word, please.
[779.13] Come on.
[780.13] Lovely.
[784.43] I didn’t do good.
[787.07] Get a grip on yourself, Mama.
[791.70] Stop it.
[799.33] Mama.
[807.47] Stop it, mama.
[812.37] Why are you worrying yourself?
[814.17] You know…
[817.57] Papa’s temperament.
[819.93] Fiza tell her,
[822.07] I don’t want to talk to 
her about anything.
[824.53] Why don’t you want to talk to me?
[826.03] What have I done?
[827.63] I just played a little radio.
[829.23] Hey, despite committing 
such a grave sin in a house
[834.17] where ten concerns 
are raised for breathing,
[837.03] you're asking what you have done?
[840.03] Be thankful that you are still alive.
[844.53] Okay,
[845.93] I will be thankful too.
[849.80] What was the need for you 
to buy a radio and bring it?
[853.27] Why don’t you say
[854.60] what is the need to breathe freely?
[857.27] At times, I want to 
run away from here.
[858.87] Dua.
[859.37] What?
[860.13] Think before you speak.
[861.60] You are speaking without thinking.
[863.73] Yes, so?
[864.73] The more there will be 
restrictions on speaking,
[866.37] the tongue will be equally bitter.
[874.73] Everyone has made such a face like
[876.37] God knows what happened to them.
[879.60] Although,
[880.30] I am not the one who didn’t eat food,
[881.80] I am the one who got scolded,
[883.70] and my radio got broken.
[885.57] But no,
[886.43] dare anyone care for me.
[888.17] Has anyone ever asked
 me as a formality
[890.37] that child,
[890.97] you must be hungry, will you eat?
[893.53] Hey, what’s for food?
[896.73] I am really hungry.
[898.40] Mama made cauliflower 
and potatoes.
[901.37] What did she cook?
[903.60] Cauliflower potatoes,
[907.47] gourd potatoes, eggplant potatoes.
[912.03] Do we get potatoes for free?
[914.53] I don't want to eat potatoes.
[916.03] I don't want these vegetables.
[918.80] Make something good for once, 
like chicken, meat, or chicken curry.
[923.93] No need to make so much noise.
[926.27] Be thankful and eat 
whatever has been cooked.
[929.60] If Papa hears your thoughts,
[931.30] then another problem
 will be created for us.
[933.37] Then he should hear it,
[934.43] but I don’t want to eat
[935.30] this cauliflower and potatoes, every day.
[937.00] Hey, why did I take a day off?
[938.23] I would have comfortably 
sat in the canteen
[939.40] and eaten something.
[940.80] I don’t know where have I been born.
[946.67] What do I do with this girl?
[948.50] She is becoming a test for me.
[972.80] Brother.
[991.33] Brother. Brother.
[995.43] What is your problem?
[997.47] You are screaming close to 
my ear early in the morning.
[1000.13] Early morning?
[1001.83] It is beyond 12 noon.
[1004.53] Yes, so what is new in this?
[1007.07] The clock strikes 12 noon every day.
[1008.60] Mama has said that
[1009.43] you wake up before 
the afternoon prayers,
[1010.70] and go to the shop.
[1011.73] Papa must be waiting for you.
[1013.70] Oh man, this problem of the shop…
[1016.77] What?
[1019.40] Filmy magazine?
[1021.30] In your room?
[1023.07] If Papa sees it, then?
[1024.73] Hey, so who will tell Papa?
[1027.93] And who told you to come to 
my room and investigate?
[1030.80] What is the need for you to
 keep this in your room?
[1033.77] What would you know,
[1035.87] they have thousands of followers.
[1039.53] Leave their followers and
 focus on the shop brother.
[1042.87] Man, I am really tired of this shop,
[1044.90] I don’t know what Papa’s problem is.
[1046.83] It would have been better
[1047.90] if I hadn’t completed my college education.
[1050.37] You should help Papa out anyway, right?
[1054.93] Okay, don’t lecture me.
[1056.27] Go and make breakfast.
[1059.10] I will, but
[1060.30] you wake up quickly and get fresh.
[1062.53] Get fresh.
[1073.57] It is finally morning for the prince,
[1075.07] huh? You are awake!
[1077.70] Mama, I don’t understand,
[1079.47] why you taunt me as 
soon as you see me.
[1082.10] I am already in a bad mood.
[1083.87] I don’t get to sleep enough,
[1085.87] and you wake me up 
early in the morning,
[1087.47] so that I go and sit at the shop.
[1088.80] So, sleep early at night.
[1091.20] How will you wake up
 early in the morning,
[1093.33] if you are on your 
phone all night long?
[1095.07] Yeah, right, I am on my phone.
[1097.27] I don’t have a fiancée,
[1098.60] who I sit and chat with.
[1099.83] I just have friends,
[1101.20] I just chat with them on the phone.
[1102.87] Do you understand the hint, mama?
[1104.80] When do I have a fiancée that
[1106.40] I chat with her on the phone?
[1107.27] This means,
[1108.47] now he should have a fiancée,
[1110.67] with whom he can chat on the phone.
[1112.87] Listen to me,
[1113.73] don’t instigate
 the matter, understand?
[1115.47] Brother has the desire in his heart,
[1117.03] but he doesn’t let go of his pride.
[1119.93] I had asked you for breakfast,
[1121.20] go bring it.
[1122.33] Oh yes, I forgot,
I have kept it on the stove.
[1124.20] Mama, I’m keeping this, there.
[1130.17] Yes, now I will look
 for a girl for you.
[1132.60] You have appeared for
 your graduation exam.
[1134.53] Now when you get 
your result and find a job,
[1137.23] then I will marry you.
[1138.93] Mama, what is this condition of finding
 a job you have put on my marriage?
[1141.90] Don’t worry,
[1143.17] I will find a working woman for you,
[1144.60] someone who does a job.
[1146.17] Okay,
[1147.13] now will I live on my wife’s earnings?
[1149.40] The times when wives 
used to be at home
[1152.80] and the husbands used 
to work have passed.
[1154.67] Now, the times are such that
[1156.50] things work out when 
both of them work.
[1160.53] Hey, I don’t want to get married.
[1163.30] Give me breakfast.
[1174.60] Greetings, Mr. Aslam.
[1176.97] Greetings. Greetings.
[1179.13] How are you?
[1184.17] So, how much 
are these apples for?
[1187.47] These are apples from 
Quetta. From Quetta.
[1189.10] They are really juicy.
[1191.50] Yes, that’s why they
 look red and fresh.
[1197.27] Taste it.
[1198.23] What is the rate?
[1199.63] I will give them to you
 for two fifty rupees.
[1205.07] How many kilos do 
you want, Mr. Aslam?
[1206.93] Huh…how much…
[1210.33] leave it right now.
[1211.63] Huh?
[1233.23] Yes, buddy.
[1233.97] Yes, what is going on?
[1235.87] Nothing, man,
[1237.17] I am just sitting free,
[1238.80] doing nothing.
[1239.93] Yes, even I can see that.
[1241.40] Brother, tell me,
[1242.53] do you want to do something 
after getting free from college, or
[1244.73] do you want to sit free like this?
[1246.07] I want to do a lot,
[1248.90] but for that,
[1250.33] two million to two and 
a half million rupees,
[1252.33] and I don’t have that.
[1253.83] Hey man, this is the problem 
with us young people.
[1256.40] We have a lot of ideas, but
[1257.93] we are short on cash,
[1259.17] and if you try to explain
 your idea to the family
[1261.60] that there is so much 
investment required,
[1263.10] they'll say go and 
do a janitor's job.
[1265.67] I mean, look at me.
[1267.03] They made me sit at the
 shop after my education, now
[1269.50] I was not born to do small jobs.
[1271.60] You are so handsome.
[1273.10] What do they say,
[1274.07] you should be the
 owner of an ad agency.
[1277.70] Yes, that’s how it is, but
[1279.47] I don’t know where 
our fate is sleeping.
[1281.47] I have been sitting
 here for so long,
[1282.77] and you didn’t even 
offer me a cup of tea?
[1285.30] Sorry. Sorry.
[1287.03] Brother, bring two cups of tea.
[1290.43] And yes, listen,
[1292.90] we have to go tomorrow.
[1294.30] Where do we have to go?
[1296.00] I will tell you when I come tomorrow.
[1302.57] Come on, start eating.
[1304.30] Here.
[1304.87] Where is Dua?
[1306.67] Huh? Call Dua?
[1310.17] She is studying sitting on the roof.
[1312.87] Hey, tell her,
[1313.83] Mr. Mirza has sent such
 amazing food for the niyaz.
[1317.47] This miser sends food seldom.
[1319.73] Huh?
[1320.37] He was saying it is really delicious.
[1322.27] And I have eaten the food from Mr. Mirza,
[1323.40] it is delicious. Go,
[1324.47] and call Dua. Come on.
[1326.63] Mr. Aslam,
[1328.70] she doesn’t like these
 lentils and vegetables.
[1331.87] She doesn’t eat it.
[1333.10] When you go out after 
having food, then
[1336.00] bring me some meat,
[1337.57] and I will cook it for her.
[1339.23] Okay, chicken, meat,
[1343.37] is her food not complete without this?
[1345.20] Huh?
[1346.63] If she doesn’t want to eat it, 
then she shouldn’t.
[1347.80] And how are you bringing 
the children up, Fehmida?
[1352.20] Teach them the value of contentment.
[1354.63] They need to go to their own homes.
[1356.50] We will end up empty-handed here.
[1358.20] And this is all we'll have at our home.
[1361.00] Come on, eat. Take it.
[1363.73] Eat.
[1368.00] And the one who doesn’t
 want to eat, shouldn’t.
[1370.20] they should die of hunger if they want.
[1371.80] I don’t care if they die of hunger.
[1477.50] Hey, this is my food.
[1479.37] Please, where are you taking it?
[1480.27] Please, give me this food.
[1480.93] This is my food. My food.
[1482.50] Where are you taking it?
[1484.27] Don’t take it. Don’t take it.
[1487.30] It is mine. Don’t take it.
[1489.90] Don’t take my food.
[1491.33] This is my food. 
Dua.
[1493.07] My food. It is my food. My food…
[1495.93] Dua.
[1501.70] Where is my food?
[1504.00] I had so much food.
[1506.33] I was in such a big home, man.
[1510.23] You must surely be dreaming, right?
[1515.40] It must be a dream.
[1522.93] Are you hungry? Should I bring
 something for you to eat?
[1525.63] You are saying it like
[1527.93] we have dynamite prawns 
and manchurian.
[1531.73] You know…you know,
[1533.17] even if I die of hunger,
[1535.33] then you don’t even feed anyone dried 
bread on my third day of mourning.
[1540.97] Move this. Have food.
[1547.73] I don’t want to eat it.
[1550.03] If you don’t eat, then 
you will remain hungry.
[1552.23] You didn’t even eat 
anything all day long either.
[1554.27] It is better that I don’t eat,
[1555.57] and stay hungry instead 
of eating all this.
[1558.13] I feel nauseous smelling all this.
[1562.20] Dua, this is sustenance.
[1564.87] I know this is sustenance.
[1566.27] But, is it only this vegetable, lentils?
[1569.03] Is what I am saying not sustenance?
[1570.63] Mama, why don’t you understand?
[1573.10] Your father has finally
 found a job at a tailor’s
[1575.27] shop after sitting at home
 for several months.
[1577.43] The fees for your 
university goes after
[1579.53] combining Fiza’s salary 
and the money that he earns.
[1583.90] The rent for this home,
[1585.33] the electricity and gas bills
 are paid with difficulty.
[1591.30] If I had sons, it would 
have been different.
[1594.83] Now, should we also put both
 girls on earning a livelihood?
[1601.17] You should.
[1604.40] You should, at least,
[1605.60] we will get something good to eat.
[1609.57] Don’t talk nonsense, 
and have food.
[1611.73] I told you, I don’t want to eat it,
[1612.73] meaning, I don’t want to eat it.
[1613.50] If you don’t eat,
[1614.13] you will die of hunger.
[1615.27] So, let me die.
[1616.13] At least this way,
[1617.37] you people will get good food to eat for 
at least three days out of sympathy.
[1619.20] Shut up.
[1620.83] If you don’t have a good fate, then
[1621.87] at least speak good.
[1624.13] When will fate get 
good by talking good?
[1628.67] I don’t know how long
 all this will go on for.
[1631.63] Stop it. Mama. Mama.
[1635.80] What is wrong, Mama?
[1637.07] Because of her…
[1639.30] Don’t you feel sorry for Mama?
[1640.47] Why do you bother her so much?
[1642.07] I feel sorry.
[1643.57] I feel sorry for myself.
[1645.47] I don’t know where I was born
[1647.03] and why I was born.
[1648.13] Stop your nonsense now.
[1650.60] Mama. Mama, stop it.
[1652.73] What is wrong, Mama?
[1653.80] You cry so much about 
what she is saying.
[1655.40] She always does this.
[1656.43] Mama, tell me something.
[1657.60] You are my mother, right?
[1659.27] When you knew that
[1660.73] your husband wasn’t worthy of earning 
and feeding the children,
[1663.63] then why did you give birth 
to three daughters?
[1665.97] Stop it. Now if you
say another word,
[1668.10] it won't be good, Dua.
[1669.17] Understand?
[1670.93] Leave her, you come from here.
[1673.07] Okay?
[1673.70] When she feels hungry,
[1675.37] she will eat herself.
[1676.70] The hunger has gone 
to her head right now.
[1678.33] There is nothing else.
[1679.07] Let her be.
[1681.00] By the third day,
[1682.00] even carrion starts to 
seem permissible to people.
[1684.43] You come on.
[1684.87] Mama, come on. Leave it.
[1686.87] Yes, everyone leave me.
[1688.67] It makes no difference to me. 
Come from here.
[1689.67] You have left me anyway.
[1690.60] What difference does anything 
about me make to anyone?
[1695.10] I won't eat it. 
I don’t want to eat.
[1731.07] What sort of colors are
 you showing me?
[1732.93] Show me good colors.
[1734.43] Show them the rosy cloth.
[1736.13] Show them the rosy cloth,
[1738.27] it will look good on
 her complexion.
[1743.07] Yes, you look at this one.
[1746.97] Greetings.
[1748.10] Greetings.
[1748.90] Show me this one too.
[1756.43] Brother Aslam, I thought
 I would give you, your salary.
[1760.03] Yes.
[1769.20] Here you go, brother.
[1770.70] Count it, it is the full amount.
[1774.67] Brother Azam, I wanted if you 
could increase my salary a little.
[1777.83] Hey no,
[1779.27] even I can manage this counter.
[1781.70] Now see,
[1782.63] you said I want a job.
[1784.77] Your father and
 my father were friends,
[1788.50] so I couldn’t say no.
[1790.97] Think about it,
[1792.40] the fees of the school and 
university of the daughters
[1796.63] have increased a lot,
[1797.47] and you also see 
the inflation, brother Azam.
[1800.07] Hey, look, Mr. Aslam,
[1801.20] what you say is right.
[1802.33] But, I can do one thing.
[1804.80] I have a friend, he needs a loader.
[1808.37] The work is surely less,
[1810.07] but it requires hard work.
[1811.90] If you want, should I talk to him?
[1813.83] No. No.
[1814.60] But you will have to work hard.
[1816.27] No, no, there is no need.
[1817.30] There is no need.
[1818.23] Now, what hard work will
 I do in this old age?
[1821.67] I won’t be able to.
[1822.70] Anyway, as you wish.
[1825.37] But see, come early tomorrow.
[1828.10] The boy was telling me that you
[1830.13] are coming late for 
the past one week.
[1838.00] Where are you going right now?
[1839.20] I was just changing
 my seating position.
[1841.70] Hey, Mr. Aslam,
[1842.30] at least give your 
full time at the shop.
[1844.03] The business won’t work like this.
[1846.20] Brother Azam,
 I will continue to sit here.
[1847.47] If you tell me, I will sit here 
for twenty-four hours.
[1848.70] Thank you. Thank you very much.
[1959.33] Show me what you can do.
[1962.67] Brother, let’s have a competition today.
[1964.33] Hmmm.
[1975.80] Very nice.
[1992.93] I feel you will win today.
[1998.27] Let this last shot hit the target.
[2009.27] Brother, you were right.
[2012.40] Brother. What happened brother?
[2015.97] Take out the car. Brother.
[2018.33] Brother, nothing will happen to you.
[2019.37] Brother. Take out the car.
[2021.93] Brother. Brother, 
nothing will happen to you.
[2023.83] I am here, brother. Brother.
[2029.80] Brother, I wish,
[2031.30] that day, that bullet had
 hit me instead of you.
[2067.07] Poets have written 
ghazals for these eyes.
[2140.43] Oh God.
[2141.93] What a shameless girl.
[2144.73] The entire bus is filled 
with men and this girl...
[2148.80] Yes, sir, what can we say?
[2150.20] Times have changed nowadays.
[2152.73] These are all signs of
 the day of judgement.
[2155.27] Signs of the day of judgement.
[2156.37] No doubt.
[2157.43] We have to keep an eye on our
 daughters because of girls like her.
[2162.07] You are right.
[2162.90] I don’t know even if 
her parents are aware of
[2165.70] what her daughter is up to outside.
[2171.67] Sister, fare?
[2173.37] My maternal and paternal
 uncles are sitting at the back,
[2175.00] take it from them.
[2177.53] Leave it, buddy, she rides daily.
[2180.40] Wait.
[2184.43] Here you go.
[2186.43] Hey, see, she is not a wax doll,
[2191.10] she also speaks.
[2198.67] The court appearance is tomorrow.
[2200.33] The lawyer called and said that
[2202.30] the opposing party
 would sign a settlement
[2206.53] if you withdrew your case.
[2209.60] The lawyer wants to 
meet you once, before
[2211.53] appearing in front of the judge.
[2214.13] Find another lawyer.
[2217.73] After today,
[2218.50] this lawyer shouldn’t be seen 
handling any of my cases.
[2221.50] Any special reason?
[2224.10] The lawyer who wants to
 favor my opposing party
[2226.53] and change my thinking,
[2229.90] I will change him.
[2231.80] Okay Saeen,
[2232.93] you also had to visit the mansion.
[2234.57] It has been long since
 you visited the mansion.
[2239.57] I will tell you when I want to go.
[2244.87] Saeen,
[2245.77] we were getting calls 
from the mansion.
[2249.07] What do I say to them?
[2262.50] Saeen. Saeen.
[2263.17] Deen Muhammad has 
come to meet you, Saeen.
[2265.03] Saaen. Saeen.
[2267.63] Hey, what are you doing? Stand up.
[2269.97] Saeen, my daughter.
[2272.97] Saeen, the hooligans
 abducted our daughter.
[2275.83] We don’t even have
 an enmity with them
[2279.67] We are your followers, Saeen.
[2282.60] Save our daughter, Saeen.
[2286.33] Who abducted her?
[2288.03] Dilawar. Dilawar took her.
[2291.77] Dilawar took her. Dilawar.
[2298.27] Jaffar.
