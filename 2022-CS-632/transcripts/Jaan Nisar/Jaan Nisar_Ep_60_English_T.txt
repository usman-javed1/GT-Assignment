[26.00] Come Nosherwan.
[27.53] You called for me?
[29.10] Sit down.
[30.97] I need to talk to you
about something important.
[43.40] How long will this continue?
[47.33] What?
[51.50] Don't act ignorant.
[54.03] You know very well what we mean.
[63.60] Amma Saeein, tea.
[71.50] Kashmala has managed
the house very well.
[75.60] It would be better if you, too,
now return to life.
[89.93] Humans make mistakes,
[92.97] and wrong decisions happen too.
[99.37] You made a mistake too,
[101.20] in the form of Dua.
[113.63] But that doesn’t mean
[116.40] you should sacrifice your
entire life for one wrong decision.
[130.80] Dua will find many other Sarfaraz.
[149.10] But what about you?
[152.37] Have you thought about that?
[160.80] Look at her,
[163.37] Kashmala is not only
your past but your present.
[167.80] She is also your future.
[180.63] And the children of Zawar,
you are not just their guardian,
[183.80] they are your responsibility.
[185.97] And, in the future too,
your lineage
[188.97] will continue through Kashmala.
[205.03] Amma Saeein,
[207.93] my entire loyalty is with
Saeein and this mansion.
[217.97] I have always bowed down
to the wishes of you all,
[226.70] whatever your orders are.
[231.97] We cannot deny that Kashmala,
[235.83] you have proved to be a very good
daughter-in-law and daughter.
[246.40] That's why your
Baba Saeein and I both want
[250.77] that whatever deprivation has come into your life
because of Nosherwan should be removed.
[268.00] Nosherwan,
[270.03] after today,
[271.93] neither your Baba Saeein nor
I should have any complaints about this matter.
[284.37] Amma Saeein,
[287.10] I just want that…
[289.97] that thorn should leave Saeein’s life.
[299.33] Which thorn?
[303.13] Dua.
[316.17] As long as Dua stays in Saeein’s life,
[321.03] his name will remain
attached to hers,
[324.30] and Saeein’s life will continue
to be filled with difficulties, Amma Saeein
[336.20] I want…
[338.97] I want…
[342.40] I want Saeein to divorce Dua.
[350.03] Hmm,
[353.13] That would be best.
[359.70] To completely free yourself from Dua,
[363.80] we will have to make a tough decision.
[376.37] Nosherwan, divorce Dua.
[383.53] Ghaznavi won’t divorce me
[394.03] until I prove that it wasn’t me,
but her, who poisoned him.
[408.43] What…
[409.33] What nonsense are
you talking about?
[411.90] I’m only stating the truth.
[417.63] Such a vile act could only be done
by a lowly girl like you.
[430.40] Saeein picked you from the dust
and put you on a pedestal.
[441.37] And you,
[443.57] to hide your lover’s crime
[446.17] and seize Saeein’s wealth,
[449.03] are playing such a dirty game.
[458.30] Accusing me won’t hide your crime.
[465.80] To hide your crime,
[467.33] you got me arrested
[476.90] but look,
[478.23] I’m standing here before you.
[484.03] You are free today only
because of our son’s generosity,
[489.30] he took pity on you
and spared your life.
[496.63] Yes, Amma Saeein.
[499.80] But what you are being
shown isn’t the truth.
[511.57] When Saeein has removed you
from his home, his heart, and his life,
[516.43] then why have you come back?
[518.00] I have only come here
to clear my name
[521.03] and tell you that I didn’t poison him.
[526.00] What do you think?
[528.43] That we will believe your lies?
[536.73] You may fool Nosherwan,
[540.23] but not us
[541.60] No, Baba Saeein,
[544.30] when the time comes,
you all will believe in my innocence.
[558.17] But for now,
[560.60] I am only here to assure him
[565.33] that I love him deeply.
[581.93] I can give my life for him,
[585.43] but I could never think
of taking his life.
[600.97] So, was all that a lie?
[604.30] You cooked food for Nosherwan
[607.60] and you mixed poison in it,
[613.23] and now you're pretending to be
innocent in front of everyone?
[617.50] Yes, I cooked the food,
[621.30] but whoever mixed the poison,
[624.97] I will find out soon.
[637.30] Very soon, I will prove
who wanted to take Ghaznavi's life.
[651.73] You are accusing me?
[654.40] How dare you accuse me? Yes?
[662.73] You want to shift the burden
of your crimes onto me
[666.03] and appear innocent before everyone.
[670.70] I have given my blood to this mansion.
[673.63] I have given my days and
nights to this house.
[677.00] Will I kill my guardian?
[690.93] Only a lowly girl like
you can commit such a vile act,
[695.03] the kind of girl who would call her
lover into her house behind Saeein’s back.
[700.30] For her, taking Saeein’s
life would be an easy task.
[703.47] Saeein saw him with his
own eyes in your house.
[707.63] Deny it.
[713.60] Deny him as well.
[714.53] Tell them that he is lying too.
[727.87] Amma Saeein… I ….
[734.33] Dua, you leave from here
[741.53] and don’t come into our son's life again.
[768.60] Fine, I’ll leave.
[816.27] I have only come here to assure him
[820.90] that I love him deeply.
[824.17] I can give my life for him,
[827.80] but I could never think of taking his life.
[862.07] Water.
[864.77] Where are the girls?
[869.90] Fiza and Sania, are in the room. And
[873.97] Dua has gone outside.
[876.87] Where has she gone outside?
[878.87] I don’t know. She didn’t
tell me before leaving.
[880.20] I was praying.
[883.77] Is there something you need?
[885.30] No,
[886.47] I don’t need anything.
[889.10] How is Fiza’s health?
[892.60] Fiza’s condition has troubled me a lot.
[898.70] I don’t know what
she keeps thinking about.
[905.20] Oh God,
[909.17] I don’t know what is written in
the fate of our children, Fehmida.
[915.93] Fiza’s home was ruined,
[917.30] and she got divorced.
[919.93] And now Dua…
[924.47] God will make things better.
[926.97] Don't worry.
[931.20] Aslam,
[933.07] isn’t it good that Fiza
[937.07] has escaped from a person like him
[939.70] who wasn’t loyal to her?
[944.47] It’s not necessary to
blame everything on fate.
[947.80] Why did such a thing
happen to our daughter?
[952.97] But it’s better for her to live with
us than with such a deceptive person.
[962.77] At least she’s safe from his deceit now.
[971.70] Maybe you’re right, Fehmida.
[974.20] you’re right.
[977.80] Did you see
[980.67] how she lied and left?
[986.57] Who does such a vile act?
[989.47] Accuses someone like that?
[996.77] She wants to make me
fall in your eyes, that’s it.
[1004.87] She’s putting her crimes
on me so that
[1007.80] Nosherwan doesn’t divorce her.
[1018.20] Baba Saeein,
[1019.40] she wants to rule this house
after getting rid of Nosherwan.
[1023.10] She wants to rule over his wealth.
[1026.87] What difference does
that girl's words make?
[1031.90] Don’t we know you?
[1036.90] That’s alright, Baba Saeein,
[1041.27] but I won’t tolerate
such big accusations.
[1053.97] I have given my entire
life to a relationship
[1060.37] in which I received
nothing in return.
[1072.13] But I never complained to anyone
[1078.93] because…
[1080.70] because I never wanted
anything for myself.
[1084.80] I only know how to give,
[1086.93] that’s it.
[1100.93] How could I ever poison
my Saeein, my guardian?
[1110.67] How could I even think
of doing such a thing?
[1117.50] I have always bowed
down to your wishes.
[1127.93] After Zavaar’s departure,
[1131.20] when you asked me
to marry Saeein.
[1135.33] I agreed
[1144.27] without even thinking about
what the world would say,
[1146.40] or what people would talk about.
[1148.27] I didn’t think about anything.
[1155.17] I always bowed my head and
agreed to everything you said.
[1170.60] And this is the reward
I get for my sacrifices
[1176.73] that such a big
accusation is laid on me.
[1185.50] Such a huge accusation
has been put on me.
[1191.20] Don’t worry.
[1193.47] Don’t take it to the heart.
[1195.97] That rude girl just said whatever
came to her mind and left.
[1207.30] We trust you.
[1209.87] We know you could never
do such a vile thing.
[1287.63] Greetings.
[1294.83] Greetings.
[1297.03] Where are you coming from?
[1301.47] I went to meet Nosherwan.
[1307.20] What was the need to go to him?
[1317.27] There was a need, Mother.
[1318.87] That’s why I went to meet him.
[1323.47] When he doesn’t want
to keep you in his life,
[1326.93] why do you need
to beg at his feet?
[1335.93] I need to because I want to clear
the stain on my character.
[1351.03] When I didn’t poison Nosherwan,
[1355.03] didn’t try to kill him, then
[1358.00] why should I sit quietly and
hide with this accusation?
[1368.13] It was important for
me to tell him that
[1371.07] I was not his enemy.
[1378.83] What happened Dua?
[1381.67] What have you done
[1385.63] that made everyone
turn against you?
[1394.53] Your sister, your husband,
[1396.77] all of us have been forced
to think badly of you,
[1405.07] and you are standing
alone like a criminal.
[1413.13] It’s not always necessary, Mother, that
[1416.47] the one standing alone is the criminal.
[1426.20] Maybe the ones accusing are wrong.
[1439.80] I’m not saying that
[1445.00] anyone among you is bad,
[1449.87] but you are all victims
of misunderstanding.
[1461.03] You all are only seeing
what is being shown to you,
[1465.27] only thinking what your
mind is being forced to think.
[1472.27] You aren’t wrong.
[1484.87] But one day, I will prove
to you all that I was right.
[1497.03] And then I will live
happily with you all,
[1500.73] just like I used to.
[1510.57] I hope you will accept me then.
[1550.03] Saeein saw him with his
own eyes in your house.
[1554.17] Deny it.
[1556.20] Ghaznavi!
[1557.07] Ghaznavi, no.
[1558.70] For God’s sake, don’t do this.
[1562.40] Please, don’t kill him.
[1563.80] Please,
[1564.87] please don’t do this.
[1566.07] Can’t you see,
[1569.13] even today, how much
she cares for me?
[1572.87] Fine, Dua, I’m leaving.
[1576.53] But it’s not because
I fear him or his gun.
[1593.13] Nosherwan…
[1593.83] Why have you come here?
[1596.40] I want to talk to you.
[1597.63] I don’t want to talk to you, go.
[1599.20] But I need to talk to you.
[1603.63] Why haven’t you divorced Dua and
thrown her out of this house yet?
[1606.33] What are you waiting for?
[1621.53] Divorcing Dua or not is my matter.
[1629.33] You mind your own.
[1631.70] How can I mind my own
[1634.43] when I’m connected to you?
[1636.13] She’s poisoning you Nosherwan!
[1642.13] Every person in this mansion
is connected to you.
[1646.40] You are not anyone’s
personal property,
[1648.47] that anyone can do as
they please with you.
[1654.40] She may not value you,
[1656.53] but to us, you are very important.
[1663.03] Please divorce her and free her.
[1667.80] I don’t have the courage
to divorce her.
[1670.60] You don’t have the courage?
[1673.03] She’s poisoning you, Nosherwan,
[1675.80] and yet you say
you don’t have the courage?
[1682.70] I don’t understand
how you can trust her so much.
[1687.27] She’s even going to be
the mother of Sarfaraz’s child,
[1692.87] and still, you trust her?
[1697.30] What did she give you
[1699.80] that makes you blindly
trust her every word?
[1702.80] This is my issue.
[1704.20] I will handle it.
[1705.30] This is not just your issue.
[1707.90] It’s all of ours.
[1711.50] If anyone hurts you,
[1713.33] I won’t tolerate them
in this house, enough.
[1715.60] I can take care of myself.
[1720.67] Now leave from here.
[1721.87] Care for yourself?
[1725.47] Is this how you’ve
taken care of yourself?
[1727.63] She was poisoning you.
[1733.03] Nosherwan,
[1733.53] You gave her so much freedom
[1736.60] that she went as far
as trying to take your life.
[1743.87] I’m leaving. I’ll go.
[1747.13] But for God’s sake,
please think about this.
[1762.03] I understand that
you married Ghaznavi
[1764.70] because you wanted his money.
[1765.60] And today, when he finds out the truth,
[1767.60] he will leave you.
[1768.70] But don’t deny my love like this.
[1771.90] You cooked food for Nosherwan,
[1774.73] you poisoned it,
[1776.70] and now you’re acting
innocent in front of everyone.
[1780.90] Yes, I cooked the food,
[1784.90] but I will soon find out
who mixed the poison in it.
[1792.03] Very soon, I will prove
who wanted to take Ghaznavi’s life.
[1825.20] When Saeein has already kicked
you out of his house, his heart, and his life,
[1830.13] then what are you here for?
[1832.27] Do you think
[1834.70] we will believe your lies?
[1839.03] You may be able to fool Nosherwan,
[1842.50] but not us.
[1887.03] Ghaznavi,
[1892.40] Ghaznavi…
[1905.67] Will you say nothing at all?
[1913.03] Do you also think that
[1916.93] I poisoned your food?
[1928.07] Do you not trust me?
[1934.20] Please don’t say this.
[1944.43] I’ve always been loyal to you.
[1950.03] As much as I was on the very first day.
[1959.30] I love you so much, Ghaznavi.
[1964.40] I have no one else besides you.
[1980.87] You’re leaving me alone
when I need you the most.
[1991.80] Please don’t do this.
[1994.67] I don’t care what others think.
[1999.93] It only matters what you think about me.
[2007.47] Tell me.
[2011.27] Just once,
[2013.90] just once, tell me that you trust me.
[2019.13] That you believe in me.
[2024.10] Why don’t you trust me?
[2027.23] There’s a conspiracy to separate us.
[2038.47] Ghaznavi Please…
[2054.67] Ghaznavi…
