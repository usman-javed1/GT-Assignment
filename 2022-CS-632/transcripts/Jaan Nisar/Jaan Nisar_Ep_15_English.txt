It is fine. You can leave. What happened? Why did you take out my bags? I told him to do this. You? But why? You have your breakfast. The cars are ready outside. My driver will drop 
you at the mansion. Listen. Nosherwan, I came here to take care of you. Thank you very much, but I can care for myself. Put Madam’s bags in the car. Nosherwan, you are insulting me sending 
me forcefully from here, like this. No. I tried to let you leave yourself and that things don’t come to this. You find me to be so bad. You being here or not being 
here means nothing to me. It is not about finding
 you good or bad. I don’t understand. I don’t understand, how someone can be so difficult. Goodbye. What does she say? She does not agree. Then convince her. If we do what these
 girls say and think, then we will die of hunger. She is stubborn, it will take some time. Time is what we don’t have. Everyone is in 
search of new faces. There, Mr. Sarkar is sitting,
 filled with anger. He is saying to send it again. If her mind is in the right place, then I will send her anywhere. She will go and
 create a new scene. Today is the first day, she will agree soon. Then make her agree. And have you just kept
 this cigarette to blow smoke? Light it up and put it to use. Understand? Fine. Don’t worry. The work will get done. Rumi, what are you
 standing outside? Come in. What is she saying? She is showing tantrums. Although, she knows that there is no one here,
 who will tolerate her tantrums. You had bothered 
me the same way. I was stupid. And Dua is repeating 
the same stupidity. She will agree soon. Right now, she is not
 aware of the world outside. When she finds out, she will agree. She will agree. Go and shed your 
tears somewhere else. You have already spread 
misfortune in my life. Why are you doing this with me? Why am I doing this? After what you and your
 family did with me, I should get rid of you. And I will decide about you, right now. You will see. What are you saying? How many days have 
we been married? And you made 
my life hell in those days. I don’t have a fault in all this, I didn’t do anything. What are you punishing me for? No. No. The fault is mine. The fault is mine that 
I got married to such a family. Dua’s crime hasn’t 
even been proven yet. Believe me, I know my sister. She is not like that. No. Stop it! You are not like this, your sister is not like that, I am tired of hearing this. What happened? What happened? Why are you screaming? What will people think 
when they hear you? Mama, Papa didn’t do
 good by restricting me. Okay. Okay. Cool down. Cool down. Tell him I have become quiet today, but what I want will happen. What fight have you 
started in my home? You made both father and 
son stand in front of each other. I had brought you thinking 
that you would keep the home together, but you turned out to be 
someone who breaks the home. Now why are you crying 
like a cunning girl? Stop this drama. Quiet! Please agree. Never. Why are you becoming an 
enemy of your own life? Did you come here to scare me? No. In fact, I came to make 
you understand. Your endurance will 
have to kneel in front of the extreme injustice
 of these people. When you have to agree with them, then why torture yourself like this? Never. I will die, but I will 
never agree to them. They will even make
 your bones agree. I am your well-wisher, that’s why I am making
 you understand. All of you are the same, go from here. Dua, don’t insist. You don’t waste your time. You are only harming yourself. If you want to escape from here, then do exactly what I say. Why are you showing 
sympathy towards me? Because I have started 
to see myself in you. You are saying all this 
to convince me, but I will not agree. It is up to you. if you don’t want to trust me, then don’t. I too was like you. Stubborn. The only difference is that you were exploited 
in the name of love, while I was deceived under
 the pretense of marriage. In my family, love marriages 
were not allowed. I was already a rebel, and falling in love only intensified my defiance. I eloped under the cover of night 
with the promise of marriage. The man who was supposed
 to become my husband ended up selling me, Zunaira. Your lover has sold you to me, after taking the entire amount. I too was not agreeing to you, but I had to bow down 
in front of their injustice. I will die, but I will not agree
 with what Zunaira is saying. Don’t be mad, Dua. If you really want to 
escape from here, then do as I say. I cannot trust you. The condition you are in, perhaps if I were in your place then... I too wouldn’t have believed you. But, believe in me, I see myself in you. I had no one to save me, that’s why I got ruined. I want that I don’t let you get ruined. That’s why, when Zunaira comes, tell her that you agree. It is my responsibility to get you out 
of here, seeing the right opportunity. You can trust me this much, right? Saaein, Mr. Qasim called. He has invited you as 
a special guest to his party. Jaffar I wont go. Say no to him. Saeein, how can I say no? He is your close friend. He was saying he would call you himself. Fine, I will say no to
 him when he calls. By the way, I think you should go. Jaffar, I don’t feel like it. I apologize for the disobedience, Saeein. Since you have found out about that girl, you have been really hurt on the inside. I tried to search for her a lot, but I didn’t find out
 anything about her. I don't know if the earth swallowed her or the sky devoured her. No Jaffar, I will surely find that girl. My heart testifies. You know, I had seen her falling from 
a high place in my dream and then she had this accident. I feel I haven’t seen 
this dream for no reason. I surely have a connection with that girl. Saeein, when you
 didn’t tell her anything. I mean, when you don’t know her, then what sort of connection? That’s the thing. My heart wanted to
 make a mistake again, I have made it understand. But it refuses to understand. Okay Saeein, I will go now. Dua. Dua. What has happened to you? Dua. Dua. Dua, drink water. Dua. Dua, water. Why have you become your enemy? You will die like this. Let me die. Try and understand, Dua. Leave from here, please. Leave. Listen to me. I swear on my late mother that I will take you out of here. But give up this stubbornness. Drink water. You are her friend, you would know where she is. I was her friend, but not anymore. Who keeps friendships with girls, who have no respect in society? Where have you gone? I am unable to find out anything. Your own friend doesn’t 
want to talk about you. What has happened to you, Dua? I am worried further
 thinking about this. How and where do I search 
for you in such a big city? As soon as Rumi told me that you have agreed, then I took you out of the imprisonment 
without wasting a minute. Okay… Oh. Tsk. Tsk. Tsk. This Bashir is really cruel and merciless. How he burned poor
 Dua so mercilessly. He showed no mercy. Tsk. Tsk. You must be in pain, right? The food is here. Hey, now I will make my Dua eat food with my own hands. We are not your enemies. Yes? Come on, have the food. I don’t want to eat. You will have to eat. Your beauty will fade 
without eating and drinking. You will lose your importance. That’s why, eat the food. Eat the food! Eat a lot. Give me something in
 the name of God. May God keep you happy. Give me something in the name of God. May God keep you happy. Baba Saeein, give me something in 
the name of God, may God keep you happy. Pray for me. I pray to God, may God keep you happy. May God keep you happy. May God keep you happy, sir. Oh God, make me meet her once. Then I will never leave 
her alone to get lost. This is my promise. What happened? You still 
haven’t chopped the vegetable? Hey, what is this? Such thick peals of potato? Did your family not teach
 you how to chop vegetables? I try. Okay tell me, I have heard you used to do a job. Yes, I used to teach at a school. So, what is the plan? Since when will you join back? Join back? I had thought I would go and resign now. Resign? Hey, why would you resign? You have a good job, and nowadays, you try tirelessly but you don’t find a new job. There is no need to resign. I would say, join in from tomorrow. Sure. Will Sister-in-law do a job? If Papa finds out then, Papa will get really upset. Yes, so what if she does a job? And you don’t worry
 about your Papa. I know what I have to 
and what not to say to him. You stay quiet. And you. Come on, it is getting late. Chop the vegetables quickly, I have to cook food. Sure. Brother, it is clearly written on 
Sister-in-law’s face, that she doesn’t 
want to continue the job. So, why are you
 and Mama forcing her? Who is forcing her? Mama just said one thing. Yes, but Mama should ask 
her once for the job. She should find out her will. Mama directly gave 
her the order that you have to go to
 the job from tomorrow. Okay. So, are we doing an injustice to her that you have come to 
represent her here as a lawyer? Hey, she used to do
 a job earlier too, right? It was different earlier, Brother. Now she is your wife. Now you should take her for outings, she should have 
a good time with you. But you and Mama have forced her to do a job. Listen, remain within your limits. Talk according to your age. Do you understand? It would be better for you, you focus on your studies, and let Mama make the
 decisions about the home, she has also taken them earlier. She knows what is right
 and what isn’t. Understand? Will you not give applause
 to my discerning eyes? I could tell at first glance that you are nothing ordinary. And today everyone 
will say this seeing you. Tell me the truth. Have you seen yourself 
so beautiful before today? No. Bashir will deliver girls on time, and do as I have told you. Look, don’t create a scene. You know what I can do, right? What is all this? You had told me that you
would get me out of here. Fix the expressions on your face, Dua. Everyone including Zunaira should feel that we are having a regular discussion. To hell with Zunaira and all this. You had sworn to me, right? You swore on your mother, you have forgotten. I don’t forget anything. then? Have a little patience. Now is not the right time. When will the right time come? How much more patience
 do I need to show? Where are they sending
 me dressing me up like this? I don’t know if I find someone similar to
 that Seth or if I have to… Luck is not that favorable
 every time, that I can escape from there. Nothing will happen, Dua. Even after all this, you are saying nothing will happen. Yes, I am saying this despite all this. What do you think? Why are they sending 
us dressed up like this? I will run away. Don’t ever make such a mistake or else the feet you walk
 on and leave from here, you will never be able to 
walk on them again. If I stand here for long, then Zunaira can doubt me. I am your friend, not your enemy, which is why do as I tell you to. Change the expressions of your face, and let whatever is 
happening, happen quietly. Okay? Hey, great. Thank God you came or else the way you agreed
 I thought you wouldn’t come. If I make a commitment 
then I live up to it. Yes, yes, I know. You are true to your commitments. Now, come on. The party is waiting for you. You know, I don’t like all this. That’s why I avoid your parties. Hey, try to understand. It is a request of
 some special friends. It is for their sake, I have just called them 
for soothing the heart. You also enjoy.. I will answer this call and come. Jaffar you wait here. Hello. Where are you going? I feel suffocated because of 
the stink of alcohol and smoke. Okay, you feel suffocated, right? I will just call madam. She will fix you. Leave it. Is this how you will talk to a girl? Apologize! Sorry, madam. Forgive me, they are all my guards. Jaffar. How did Dua reach these people? I will find out, Saeein. Coffee. Thank you. I was making it for myself, so I thought I would make it for you too. I know you like tea but drink it now. Not now. Now I like the bitterness of coffee. Any special reason? Earlier life was not that harsh. Nice answer. By the way, you got scolded by Zunaira
 as soon as you came. The good thing is that your mood didn’t get spoiled. I have stopped giving Zunaira 
so much importance, that my mood gets 
spoiled because of her. Great. You are quickly getting
 used to this environment. Impression. Used to this environment? Never. You remember you have promised
 to take me out of here, right? I remember everything. I am waiting for the right moment. By the way, tell me, where will you 
go leaving from here? I mean, will your own accept you?
