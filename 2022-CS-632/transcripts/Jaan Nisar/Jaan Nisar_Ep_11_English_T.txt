[20.47] Look, I went to Dua’s home for 
her sister’s wedding yesterday,
[24.23] I think Dua has eloped
[27.77] and I thought she would be with you.
[30.33] Do you know,
[31.70] her father was so angry,
[34.23] he was investigating me,
[35.90] he was asking me to tell him who is 
his daughter having an affair with.
[40.63] And, and what did you tell him?
[42.50] What will I tell him?
[43.57] I was so scared that I didn’t even 
remember your name.
[46.70] Yes, that’s good,
[48.10] that’s good you didn’t take 
my name because
[51.47] I broke up with her a long time ago.
[54.10] What?
[56.60] Dua didn’t tell me any such thing.
[58.97] Yes, she wouldn’t have 
considered it important.
[63.27] And look, I am married now,
[66.63] so, I don’t know anyone related 
to this matter,
[69.87] and it will be better if you delete 
my number as well,
[72.77] and please don’t call me next time.
[75.77] Okay, okay,
[76.90] why would I need to stay 
in contact with you anyway?
[80.40] By the way, you should be grateful to me
[83.07] that I didn’t take your name 
in front of her father
[85.80] and also didn’t tell him 
you bought the phone for her.
[89.80] Yes, yes, I also want to say to you that,
[94.20] it will be also better for you to stay away 
from Dua and her family.
[100.30] Umm, actually the thing is, why do you
 want to call for trouble yourself?
[103.83] They will drag you into this matter 
for no reason.
[105.73] Why do I need to drag myself 
into someone’s matter?
[109.87] Anyway, I will hang up now.
[111.23] Rida? Rida?
[113.40] Yes? What is it?
[114.67] Just tell me one more thing,
[117.43] you were telling me that Dua’s sister
 got married yesterday, right?
[121.00] What is her sister’s name?
[123.20] Fiza, why?
[131.27] Bye.
[174.27] I don’t know why I feel like seeing you
[178.67] and meeting you again and again,
[180.90] this restlessness, this desperation 
is beyond my understanding.
[184.80] Now when I think about you, 
my heart starts beating faster,
[188.93] I can hear them clearly.
[192.87] You are not even aware of how 
desperate I am for you.
[213.67] Now I just have one wish, Dua,
[216.50] I have to meet you and 
make you mine.
[222.20] You wouldn’t even be aware 
of my feelings,
[227.47] but like it’s said
[229.87] if the intentions are pure, 
you succeed in your purpose.
[237.67] I will wait for you.
[254.13] I cannot hear Dua’s voice anymore.
[259.33] When we wouldn’t open the door,
[262.87] until when will she wait?
[266.00] She might have left.
[271.67] Mr. Aslam has been so cruel 
to my motherhood.
[278.90] Fehmida?
[281.50] You guys are still standing here?
[284.83] Yeah?
[286.97] Go from here.
[289.67] Come on.
[309.97] Manzoor, I knew you would be here.
[312.50] Get lost.
[313.70] Go away from here.
[314.93] Come on, get out of here,
[316.57] get out of here.
[317.37] what are you looking at my face for?
[318.87] I will give you a tight slap.
[320.80] What are you looking at?
[327.80] Who is it?
[335.57] Rida?
[337.50] Okay, okay, okay, tell me what is it?
[341.83] Why are you talking to me like this?
[343.70] Look, Dua, I am busy,
[346.33] so quickly tell me what you want. 
Why have you come here?
[351.83] Rida, actually,
[355.07] I don’t want anything,
[359.10] I have a request.
[362.30] Can you keep me in your house 
for a few days?
[366.47] I will leave as soon as I arrange something.
[369.17] Why?
[370.53] Go to your home.
[377.00] I did,
[378.90] but… 
Hmm,
[380.63] I am sure your father must have 
pushed you out of the house, right?
[388.50] You know it?
[389.73] Yes,
[391.33] I have suffered it.
[393.27] I went to attend your sister’s wedding
[395.87] and over there I found out
[398.27] that you ran away from home.
[400.57] And do you know how much your Dad 
insulted me because of what you did?
[405.60] Rida, please, I am really sorry,
[408.13] but you are my only friend,
[410.17] you, I will tell you everything,
 just listen to me once.
[412.63] Look, I have no interest in your story
[416.57] and I am not your friend either,
[418.77] understand? Now go away from here
[420.60] and forget I was ever your friend.
[516.83] Oh God,
[518.43] we tied this bond out of stupidity.
[520.83] Let Nasiban come,
[522.63] I will ask her
[524.43] if this family’s girl was the only 
one left to give to us.
[528.60] Enough, Kausar,
[530.07] you have been cursing 
the girl ever since then.
[532.20] You are telling this to me as well? 
You are saying things to me.
[535.73] Mom is right,
[542.07] how will we face people?
[545.60] Our girls cover themselves.
[548.77] Our girls don’t get pictures clicked.
[552.60] Our girls don’t keep mobile phones.
[555.77] If they don’t keep mobile phones, 
how did she run away?
[558.43] No,
[559.97] Dua didn’t have a phone,
[562.93] it was her friend Rida’s phone.
[566.50] I don’t understand why were 
you guys rushing with things.
[571.30] All this is the result of rushing into things.
[578.37] You guys should have first checked
[580.93] if the family is honorable or not from 
where you are bringing the daughter-in-law.
[585.97] That’s it, son,
[587.37] that’s the mistake we made.
[589.37] Enough, both of you!
[591.43] Enough!
[593.57] Fiza is not at fault in this whole matter.
[598.63] End this topic right here,
[602.23] understand?
[604.23] And you must go.
[606.53] I am asking you to leave.
[612.07] You too.
[621.50] And you,
[623.47] listen to me very carefully,
[626.47] if anything goes wrong,
[630.00] I will be the worst.
[638.10] Take care of daughter-in-law.
[700.73] Is that how much you love me?
[702.70] That you got scared hearing about me 
marrying someone else.
[706.47] I love you a lot.
[708.83] What are you thinking?
[710.03] I was just thinking I wish 
it was our wedding today.
[714.07] You look so beautiful, 
I can’t even tell you.
[717.57] Please, ask Aunt to come soon 
then we will leave.
[753.03] Please, believe me.
[757.00] my… 
Shut up!
[759.37] Just shut up.
[761.17] What are you doing? All this? 
What? Faraz?
[763.67] Don’t do this, don’t, please.
[770.47] I am tolerating you just 
because of my father,
[774.07] else I would have said the three words
[776.07] and set you free a long time ago.
[778.47] What is my fault in this?
[781.27] Shut up!
[817.57] No.
[844.60] What was the fault?
[850.07] He wanted peace.
[855.47] What was the fault of 
my innocent brothers?
[860.47] Jaffar?
[864.63] Yes, Sir.
[865.87] If they ask about me, 
tell them I am sleeping.
[869.07] Sir, madam is already mad at me.
[879.17] Hello?
[881.57] Jaffar?
[882.83] Yes, madam?
[885.10] What is sir’s phone doing with you?
[888.67] Umm,
[890.73] sir was resting and 
his phone was with me.
[894.17] I received it when your call rang.
[897.60] Make me talk to your sir.
[899.77] But he is sleeping.
[902.43] Wake him up if he is sleeping,
[904.53] tell him I want to talk.
[906.33] Madam, how should I wake him up,
[908.67] it was very hard for him to fall asleep,
[910.97] he was in too much pain.
[914.77] Jaffar, I know you are lying,
[917.63] your sir is not sleeping at all.
[919.23] Are you going to make me 
talk to him or not?
[921.40] Umm, madam, why would I lie to you?
[925.57] Okay, madam, I will ask him to 
talk to you when he wakes up.
[931.17] Jaffar, if you don’t make me talk to sir,
[933.37] I will complain about you to Baba Saeein.
[935.77] How can you complain about me 
to Baba Saeein over such a small thing?
[942.07] As soon as sir wakes up, 
I will make him talk to you myself.
[950.00] Jaffar?
[951.73] Jaffar?
[958.00] He is doing all this because 
he is encouraged by Nosherwan.
[966.07] By the way, sir,
[968.17] madam will kill me 
because of you someday.
[973.83] So, then you can give your life,
[976.30] you are always ready to give 
your life for me anyway.
[981.00] True that, sir,
[983.93] but my soul will wander here and there 
by being killed by the hands of a female.
[999.10] I want to introduce you to Mom.
[1001.10] My family is forcing me to get married,
[1004.03] I cannot wait any longer now.
[1006.17] This color looks very nice on you
[1009.63] and wear the same color
on our wedding day.
[1013.40] Your lover sold you to me
[1017.17] after counting all the money.
[1019.80] Dad, please don’t leave me, please.
[1022.67] Your father is dead!
[1024.23] After what I heard today,
[1027.13] even if I had a daughter 
she would have died too.
[1032.40] If you take one more step
across this door,
[1034.40] I will bury you alive.
[1035.87] For God’s sake, 
let her come in.
[1037.63] Get out of here. 
Dad, let me come in,
[1038.83] I will tell you, Mom, it wasn’t my fault.
Enough is enough,
[1042.30] there is no place for a characterless girl
like you in this house.
[1045.33] We can sit inside and talk about 
whatever needs to be said.
[1047.70] No, move, move back. 
Dad, listen to me, please Dad.
[1049.70] Get lost.
[1069.87] It means that sister-in-law is Dua’s sister
and you didn’t recognize her?
[1074.40] How could I recognize her?
[1077.83] I had a garland on my face,
[1080.03] where the car stopped,
[1081.83] which house we went to, 
which tent we entered.
[1085.20] And I don’t recognize her family anyway, 
when did I ever meet them before?
[1089.27] Okay why are you getting so angry?
[1091.03] I am not getting angry, 
I am just saying that
[1094.43] don’t say anything wrong, 
I am already very angry.
[1097.50] Okay, relax, I won’t.
[1104.13] Dua must have recognized you.
[1107.57] I didn’t come face-to-face with her.
[1111.77] What do you mean by you didn’t 
come face-to-face with her?
[1114.27] She didn’t see her brother-in-law 
at her sister’s wedding?
[1116.87] She would have only recognized me
had she been in the wedding.
[1120.17] So where was she?
[1124.20] It’s just,
[1126.83] the way she was having an affair with me,
I don’t know how many more were there,
[1131.17] she went to meet someone that day,
[1134.00] and then she disappeared from there,
[1135.87] when we asked the family, 
they said
[1138.10] she is not well so she is not coming out, 
she is inside.
[1141.97] The actual story was that she went 
to some immoderate place.
[1147.27] The police raided there and
[1149.87] the police arrested them. 
What are you saying?
[1152.70] But she doesn't look 
that kind of girl to me.
[1155.27] Hey, I used to feel the same,
[1157.87] but feeling something and something 
actually happening are two different things.
[1161.33] No, I mean,
[1162.73] I am not convinced 
she is that kind of girl.
[1165.00] So then don’t be convinced,
[1167.13] but if you are not convinced 
that won’t change her reality.
[1170.60] You mean to say you still 
haven’t confronted Dua yet
[1173.17] and she doesn't know 
you are her brother-in-law?
[1175.97] Yes, that’s how it is.
[1179.50] So, now when you meet her
[1181.57] it will be as a brother-in-law?
[1182.97] I don’t think that will happen.
[1186.17] Her father has cut ties with her 
so that won’t happen.
[1192.83] Poor girl.
[1194.37] Does she seem like a poor girl to you?
[1196.20] Here my first morning after my wedding
has been ruined and became hell,
[1200.17] and you think she is a poor girl.
[1201.90] Only your morning has become hell,
[1203.73] I feel her whole life will become hell.
[1211.70] Did you, with her…?
[1213.33] Am I the only person you got to blame?
[1215.97] Are you my friend or enemy?
[1217.17] Okay, why are you getting angry?
[1218.73] I just had a thought so I asked.
[1220.57] Keep your thoughts to yourself, 
understand?
[1224.03] I just told you that
[1226.77] I had no relationship with her, 
I broke up with her,
[1230.43] and after that, I don’t know 
what happened, what she did.
[1281.27] Kashmala?
[1282.50] Yes, Amma Saeein?
[1284.03] Sit, sit,
[1290.67] you were having a headache,
[1293.20] how are you feeling now?
[1296.17] Yes, I am better now.
[1299.07] You should have rested for a while.
[1301.20] When do you get a chance to 
sleep well at the hospital?
[1304.43] I did rest, Amma Saeein.
[1308.77] Kashmala, you shouldn’t think so much,
[1313.00] you will stay worried,
[1315.97] that is why you have 
headaches all the time.
[1319.37] You will get tired.
[1324.63] Why tired?
[1327.40] You all are my family.
[1330.47] I just keep myself busy with work
[1334.47] so I don’t get bored alone, all day.
[1338.57] I can understand.
[1342.37] Happiness has gone away from 
this house since Zawar left.
[1349.60] It’s like autumn came and 
never left our home.
[1354.70] And Nosherwan,
[1357.00] he doesn’t think of anyone for months.
[1361.07] I have told your Baba Saeein 
so many times to talk to him,
[1365.73] that he should bring you 
and the kids here.
[1370.33] We have such a big house and 
there is no one to live here,
[1373.70] but he doesn’t listen,
[1375.53] he just says I don’t have a 
permanent place to reside,
[1380.37] and you and the kids will become her 
weakness because of so many enemies around.
[1386.73] You are safer in the mansion there.
[1389.47] Yes, but Amma Saaein,
[1392.23] if you and Baba Saeein will force him,
he will agree.
[1396.67] Tell him to live with us in the mansion,
[1401.60] his life will also not be in danger there.
[1405.93] We have tried that too,
[1408.20] but he doesn’t listen.
[1410.97] I don’t know what happened 
to him after Zawar,
[1415.50] he has always been stubborn,
[1418.47] but now he doesn’t listen to anyone.
[1445.10] Come, let’s go.
[1447.80] The bullet was shot in my hand, 
I haven’t crippled my leg.
[1449.97] Let’s go.
[1450.80] I just thought you might be 
feeling weak.
[1454.43] I am perfectly all right,
[1456.63] I will even take this off in 2 to 3 days.
[1458.53] Let’s go before the doctor 
changes his plan.
[1472.80] I have no interest in your story,
 understand?
[1476.70] Now go away from here and 
forget I was ever your friend.
[1509.30] My son is back home.
[1513.13] They were to discharge you 
tomorrow, right?
[1517.60] Shall I go back?
[1522.20] Kashmala,
[1523.63] Nosherwan has recovered and
 is back home,
[1526.00] make arrangements for charity.
[1528.53] Amma Saeein, I distributed 10 goats
to the poor people yesterday
[1532.70] and I even got 1000 birds freed.
[1536.37] Now that Nosherwan is home,
[1538.97] we will do more charity tomorrow.
[1541.47] I am in my room. 
I will rest for a bit.
[1543.83] Jaffar, 
Yes, Sir,
[1545.53] please help Nosherwan go inside,
[1548.37] he shouldn’t be standing here
for very long anyway.
[1552.23] The more he rests,
[1554.07] the better it is for him.
[1558.10] No Baba Saeein, I can walk,
[1563.93] I don’t need anyone’s support.
[1572.17] I got diet food made for you,
[1576.07] I can get it served, you go and rest.
[1593.37] Come, let’s serve the food, come.
[1615.00] I didn’t feel so much pain from this bullet
[1617.83] as much as I would feel seeing 
Kashmala in this room.
[1640.47] After all, when will the test end?
[1668.37] Fehmida,
[1671.10] until when will you mourn?
[1674.80] She is dead for us.
[1677.97] Don’t say that.
[1682.27] I don’t know 
what my daughter went through.
[1684.67] She is not our daughter.
[1686.73] She is not our daughter.
[1689.53] The one who killed mine
and my family’s honor.
[1697.30] She...
[1699.17] She threw dirt on our faces and left.
[1703.33] My heart is still not convinced,
[1706.73] our Dua is not like that.
[1710.90] You should have listened to her once.
[1712.60] Why would I listen to her? Why?
[1715.97] What do you want?
[1717.87] I should have heard her truths and lies,
[1720.00] and brought her back.
[1722.67] She wanted to apologize,
[1726.03] you should have given her 
a chance to clarify.
[1727.80] I don’t want her apology, 
I don’t want it.
[1731.87] Don’t be so harsh, Mr. Aslam.
[1734.33] Fehmida,
[1736.13] you are sitting at home, 
you don’t know anything,
[1739.23] I am the one who steps out 
in the neighborhood,
[1741.10] the people who used to look 
at us with honor,
[1743.53] they make fun of me now,
[1745.43] what do I see in their eyes?
[1747.33] You don’t know. I will kill someone.
[1751.40] You didn’t let her come home.
[1755.33] God knows where my daughter 
must be wandering.
[1757.53] Fehmida, even if she dies 
in a car accident
[1760.90] and I find her dead body, I don’t care.
[1763.57] I don’t care at all.
[1766.50] And listen,
[1768.00] also be concerned about the daughter 
you just married off.
[1770.97] If her in-laws find out about 
the doings of this daughter,
[1775.10] what will we tell them, 
have you thought about it?
[1779.00] we all should die.
[1782.73] She shamed us and went,
[1785.40] she brought disgrace 
to all of us and left.
[1788.47] I don’t know
[1789.60] where my daughter must be wandering.
[1794.20] Pray Fehmida,
[1797.40] that she dies.
[1802.53] We will only be able to get rid of 
this shame when she dies.
[1822.40] Madam?
[1823.67] Madam?
[1825.00] The time of the park is over.
[1828.57] Hey girl?
[1829.90] Can’t you hear?
[1832.63] Get up from here.
[1835.53] What happened?
[1836.93] The time of the park is over.
[1838.60] Get out of here, go home.
[1843.70] Look, we have orders to 
close the park in time,
[1848.60] all the people left,
[1850.17] only you are here, 
come on, go home.
[1857.43] I,
[1858.47] where will I go?
[1861.47] I don’t even have a home,
[1864.33] don’t let me out.
[1865.97] Go wherever you want to go,
[1867.57] but don’t waste my time,
[1869.83] I have to go home as well. 
Come on, good girl.
[1876.47] Brother, I will keep on sitting here,
[1881.97] you lock the door and leave.
[1884.67] I will keep on sitting here when 
people will come in the morning.
[1888.73] Hey, girl, have you lost your mind?
[1891.47] A lot of drug addicts jump through 
the park wall and come here,
[1895.83] I will lose my job if I leave you here 
and something wrong happens with you.
[1901.47] Come, get up from here, 
good girl, come.
[1904.83] Come, come, come. 
Good girl.
[1906.60] Good girl, get up.
[1909.40] Get up, come on,
[1910.97] come on, come on. Good girl.
[2011.00] To be honest, sister Dua didn’t 
seem that kind of a girl to me.
[2016.60] My sister is not like that,
[2020.93] I am sure,
[2022.73] I am sure someone trapped her.
[2026.60] Did you find out?
[2028.20] Is she back home or not?
[2030.80] I don’t know,
[2033.63] everyone must be so worried at home,
[2037.00] that is why no one came.
[2039.17] Obviously, everyone must be worried.
[2046.87] What is it?
[2053.40] Do you want to bring my sister
[2055.70] to the same path by telling her 
the stories of your characterless sister?
[2061.50] No, I was just…
[2064.10] I don’t want to listen to anything, 
do you understand?
[2066.07] Stay away from her.
[2069.43] Brother, I and sister-in-law were just…
Quiet!
[2076.30] What do we know about 
how she has been raised?
[2081.03] It is better you stay away from her, 
there is no need to spend time with her.
[2086.27] Come on, go away from here, come on.
[2089.70] Brother, sister-in-law was just… 
I told you
[2091.67] I didn’t want to listen to anything,
[2093.27] just stay away from her. Come on.
[2105.33] You shouldn’t have raised your finger
on my mother’s brought up.
[2108.00] So, what else should I say?
[2110.23] I should falsely praise her?
[2113.17] Did you forget where she was caught?
[2115.17] What are you saying?
[2117.57] I sometimes don’t understand 
why I even interact with you,
[2119.97] why do I even talk to you
[2121.53] but listen to one thing very carefully,
[2124.57] stay away from my sister,
[2127.60] if you put any wrong thing in her mind, 
I will be the worst.
[2131.20] I will kick you out of the house and
I won’t even think about Dad.
[2136.03] Now get lost!
[2173.97] Where are you going?
[2175.67] Let us drop you. 
Come, come.
[2179.30] What are you thinking?
[2182.53] Come, come, 
where are you going?
[2184.50] Wait, listen.
[2187.00] Why are you getting scared?
[2189.40] Come, we are good people.
[2191.90] Come.
