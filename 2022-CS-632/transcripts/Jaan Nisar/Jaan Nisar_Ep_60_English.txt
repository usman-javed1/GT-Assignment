Come Nosherwan. You called for me? Sit down. I need to talk to you
about something important. How long will this continue? What? Don't act ignorant. You know very well what we mean. Amma Saeein, tea. Kashmala has managed
the house very well. It would be better if you, too,
now return to life. Humans make mistakes, and wrong decisions happen too. You made a mistake too, in the form of Dua. But that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice your
entire life for one wrong decision. Dua will find many other Sarfaraz. But what about you? Have you thought about that? Look at her, Kashmala is not only
your past but your present. She is also your future. And the children of Zawar,
you are not just their guardian, they are your responsibility. And, in the future too,
your lineage will continue through Kashmala. Amma Saeein, my entire loyalty is with
Saeein and this mansion. I have always bowed down
to the wishes of you all, whatever your orders are. We cannot deny that Kashmala, you have proved to be a very good
daughter-in-law and daughter. That's why your
Baba Saeein and I both want that whatever deprivation has come into your life
because of Nosherwan should be removed. Nosherwan, after today, neither your Baba Saeein nor
I should have any complaints about this matter. Amma Saeein, I just want that… that thorn should leave Saeein’s life. Which thorn? Dua. As long as Dua stays in Saeein’s life, his name will remain
attached to hers, and Saeein’s life will continue
to be filled with difficulties, Amma Saeein I want… I want… I want Saeein to divorce Dua. Hmm, That would be best. To completely free yourself from Dua, we will have to make a tough decision. Nosherwan, divorce Dua. Ghaznavi won’t divorce me until I prove that it wasn’t me,
but her, who poisoned him. What… What nonsense are
you talking about? I’m only stating the truth. Such a vile act could only be done
by a lowly girl like you. Saeein picked you from the dust
and put you on a pedestal. And you, to hide your lover’s crime and seize Saeein’s wealth, are playing such a dirty game. Accusing me won’t hide your crime. To hide your crime, you got me arrested but look, I’m standing here before you. You are free today only
because of our son’s generosity, he took pity on you
and spared your life. Yes, Amma Saeein. But what you are being
shown isn’t the truth. When Saeein has removed you
from his home, his heart, and his life, then why have you come back? I have only come here
to clear my name and tell you that I didn’t poison him. What do you think? That we will believe your lies? You may fool Nosherwan, but not us No, Baba Saeein, when the time comes,
you all will believe in my innocence. But for now, I am only here to assure him that I love him deeply. I can give my life for him, but I could never think
of taking his life. So, was all that a lie? You cooked food for Nosherwan and you mixed poison in it, and now you're pretending to be
innocent in front of everyone? Yes, I cooked the food, but whoever mixed the poison, I will find out soon. Very soon, I will prove
who wanted to take Ghaznavi's life. You are accusing me? How dare you accuse me? Yes? You want to shift the burden
of your crimes onto me and appear innocent before everyone. I have given my blood to this mansion. I have given my days and
nights to this house. Will I kill my guardian? Only a lowly girl like
you can commit such a vile act, the kind of girl who would call her
lover into her house behind Saeein’s back. For her, taking Saeein’s
life would be an easy task. Saeein saw him with his
own eyes in your house. Deny it. Deny him as well. Tell them that he is lying too. Amma Saeein… I …. Dua, you leave from here and don’t come into our son's life again. Fine, I’ll leave. I have only come here to assure him that I love him deeply. I can give my life for him, but I could never think of taking his life. Water. Where are the girls? Fiza and Sania, are in the room. And Dua has gone outside. Where has she gone outside? I don’t know. She didn’t
tell me before leaving. I was praying. Is there something you need? No, I don’t need anything. How is Fiza’s health? Fiza’s condition has troubled me a lot. I don’t know what
she keeps thinking about. Oh God, I don’t know what is written in
the fate of our children, Fehmida. Fiza’s home was ruined, and she got divorced. And now Dua… God will make things better. Don't worry. Aslam, isn’t it good that Fiza has escaped from a person like him who wasn’t loyal to her? It’s not necessary to
blame everything on fate. Why did such a thing
happen to our daughter? But it’s better for her to live with
us than with such a deceptive person. At least she’s safe from his deceit now. Maybe you’re right, Fehmida. you’re right. Did you see how she lied and left? Who does such a vile act? Accuses someone like that? She wants to make me
fall in your eyes, that’s it. She’s putting her crimes
on me so that Nosherwan doesn’t divorce her. Baba Saeein, she wants to rule this house
after getting rid of Nosherwan. She wants to rule over his wealth. What difference does
that girl's words make? Don’t we know you? That’s alright, Baba Saeein, but I won’t tolerate
such big accusations. I have given my entire
life to a relationship in which I received
nothing in return. But I never complained to anyone because… because I never wanted
anything for myself. I only know how to give, that’s it. How could I ever poison
my Saeein, my guardian? How could I even think
of doing such a thing? I have always bowed
down to your wishes. After Zavaar’s departure, when you asked me
to marry Saeein. I agreed without even thinking about
what the world would say, or what people would talk about. I didn’t think about anything. I always bowed my head and
agreed to everything you said. And this is the reward
I get for my sacrifices that such a big
accusation is laid on me. Such a huge accusation
has been put on me. Don’t worry. Don’t take it to the heart. That rude girl just said whatever
came to her mind and left. We trust you. We know you could never
do such a vile thing. Greetings. Greetings. Where are you coming from? I went to meet Nosherwan. What was the need to go to him? There was a need, Mother. That’s why I went to meet him. When he doesn’t want
to keep you in his life, why do you need
to beg at his feet? I need to because I want to clear
the stain on my character. When I didn’t poison Nosherwan, didn’t try to kill him, then why should I sit quietly and
hide with this accusation? It was important for
me to tell him that I was not his enemy. What happened Dua? What have you done that made everyone
turn against you? Your sister, your husband, all of us have been forced
to think badly of you, and you are standing
alone like a criminal. It’s not always necessary, Mother, that the one standing alone is the criminal. Maybe the ones accusing are wrong. I’m not saying that anyone among you is bad, but you are all victims
of misunderstanding. You all are only seeing
what is being shown to you, only thinking what your
mind is being forced to think. You aren’t wrong. But one day, I will prove
to you all that I was right. And then I will live
happily with you all, just like I used to. I hope you will accept me then. Saeein saw him with his
own eyes in your house. Deny it. Ghaznavi! Ghaznavi, no. For God’s sake, don’t do this. Please, don’t kill him. Please, please don’t do this. Can’t you see, even today, how much
she cares for me? Fine, Dua, I’m leaving. But it’s not because
I fear him or his gun. Nosherwan… Why have you come here? I want to talk to you. I don’t want to talk to you, go. But I need to talk to you. Why haven’t you divorced Dua and
thrown her out of this house yet? What are you waiting for? Divorcing Dua or not is my matter. You mind your own. How can I mind my own when I’m connected to you? She’s poisoning you Nosherwan! Every person in this mansion
is connected to you. You are not anyone’s
personal property, that anyone can do as
they please with you. She may not value you, but to us, you are very important. Please divorce her and free her. I don’t have the courage
to divorce her. You don’t have the courage? She’s poisoning you, Nosherwan, and yet you say
you don’t have the courage? I don’t understand
how you can trust her so much. She’s even going to be
the mother of Sarfaraz’s child, and still, you trust her? What did she give you that makes you blindly
trust her every word? This is my issue. I will handle it. This is not just your issue. It’s all of ours. If anyone hurts you, I won’t tolerate them
in this house, enough. I can take care of myself. Now leave from here. Care for yourself? Is this how you’ve
taken care of yourself? She was poisoning you. Nosherwan, You gave her so much freedom that she went as far
as trying to take your life. I’m leaving. I’ll go. But for God’s sake,
please think about this. I understand that
you married Ghaznavi because you wanted his money. And today, when he finds out the truth, he will leave you. But don’t deny my love like this. You cooked food for Nosherwan, you poisoned it, and now you’re acting
innocent in front of everyone. Yes, I cooked the food, but I will soon find out
who mixed the poison in it. Very soon, I will prove
who wanted to take Ghaznavi’s life. When Saeein has already kicked
you out of his house, his heart, and his life, then what are you here for? Do you think we will believe your lies? You may be able to fool Nosherwan, but not us. Ghaznavi, Ghaznavi… Will you say nothing at all? Do you also think that I poisoned your food? Do you not trust me? Please don’t say this. I’ve always been loyal to you. As much as I was on the very first day. I love you so much, Ghaznavi. I have no one else besides you. You’re leaving me alone
when I need you the most. Please don’t do this. I don’t care what others think. It only matters what you think about me. Tell me. Just once, just once, tell me that you trust me. That you believe in me. Why don’t you trust me? There’s a conspiracy to separate us. Ghaznavi Please… Ghaznavi…
