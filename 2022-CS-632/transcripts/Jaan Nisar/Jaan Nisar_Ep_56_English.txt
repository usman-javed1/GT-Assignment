In front of my eyes, 
she gave Saeein poison, and I couldn't do anything. How would I have known that Dua, that Dua would mix poison 
in Saeein’s food? Amma Saeein, the doctors... Doctors are saying that 
Saeein’s survival... Saeein Jee, if something happens to our Nosherwan, 
I won't be able to bear it. Amma Saeein, you don't cry. Pray to God, let's pray that our Saeein gets well soon. Jaffar, throw this girl out! Even her shadow should not 
fall on Nosherwan. Why don't you leave from here? I told you, didn't I? That you shouldn't stay here. Please leave. Let her stay, Jaffar. She must have come to see whether, after her act, 
her plan was successful or not. Baba Saeein, you don't trust me either? I didn't do anything like that. My son tried to turn dirt into a crown. That's the exact reason I used 
to stop him from doing that, because people of low birth and
low status are never loyal to you. You've proven that my thoughts about you were correct. Nosherwan’s foolishness! He has prepared the tools for his own death. Please, believe me, I haven’t given poison to Ghaznavi. I can't do such a thing. There must have been a misunderstanding. We have misunderstood? Your daughter poisoned Saeein. And if the medical report proves it, no one will be able to stop her 
from going to jail. Alright, this is not the time for these conversations. We all should pray together 
for the child to recover. Child, but if you made the food, then 
where did the poison come from? I don’t know. I don't know how the poison 
got into the food. I love him so much, 
how could I take his life? Have courage, my child, 
have courage. Father, Father, Ghaznavi will recover, right? Nothing will happen to him, right? if anything happens to him, 
how will I stay alive? Where will I go? Yes, yes, he'll be fine. Don't worry. Child, what's the use of crying 
and wailing like this? Pray for his health. Doctor, how is my son? We tried our best to remove the poison, but it has spread throughout the body. We're trying our best, but the next few hours are 
very critical for the patient. Please pray for him. Thank you. You've made yourself miserable 
from all the crying. I knew it. I knew they'd start talking nonsense. There's no need to listen to their rubbish. Dua, come with me, you come with me. Hey! What nonsense are you saying? If you don’t stay quiet, 
I’ll break your face! Girl, come on, get out! I don't want to see you. Go! Didn’t you hear what Saeein said? Take her away. Go! -Let’s go child.
-No Mother, I won’t leave Ghaznavi. -Child let’s go,
-No, Mother. we’ll come again, 
Child let’s go, come on. No, Mother. We tried our best to clear the poison, but it has spread throughout the body. However, the next few hours 
are extremely critical for the patient. Oh God, please protect Ghaznavi's life. Don’t let anything happen to him. I am a great sinner, a very disobedient servant, but please, don’t reject me like others. Listen to my plea. Give Ghaznavi his life back. She is sitting here? Why are you sitting here? After doing all of this, 
you still aren't satisfied, so you came and sat here in peace? Get up! You won’t stay here. I’m not going anywhere. This is my house. Your house? What kind of house is this, where a murderer like you roams free? You poisoned Nosherwan. 
You can’t stay here. I’m not going anywhere. You have to go! Come on! -Leave me! What have I done?
-Come on, leave here. We have cleared the poison, but the patient is still unconscious. If you want, you can see the patient, but if the patient doesn’t regain 
consciousness by tomorrow morning, we won’t be able to do anything. Please continue your prayers. -Thank you, Doctor.
-Best of luck. Amma Saeein, Baba Saeein, it’s very late. You should go home, rest, and come back in the morning. We will stay with our son. I’m here with Saeein. Why are you all so worried? Jaffar is also here. Yes, Madam is right. 
You should go home and rest. I’m here, and as soon as Sir regains consciousness, I’ll bring you all. We won’t leave our son in this condition. Amma Saeein, Baba Saeein’s health isn’t great either. He’ll get sick. Please, you both go home and rest. I’ll take care of him, don’t worry. Okay, I’ll arrange another room here, so you all can rest. Yes, please come with me, the room has been arranged. Let’s go. Stay close to him. If you need anything, just call me. Alright. Come on. Nosherwan, my dear Saeein... sign this please. Good job! Here. Nosherwan, sign here, please. Please, do it, sign. Good job! Keep going, good job! Nosherwan. Since you aren’t signing, we’ll just take your thumbprint. Good job, here. That's it, one more. Good Job! That’s it! Oh God! Yes, has Saeein regained consciousness? No, not yet. Saeein. Hello Jaffar? Why are you calling me repeatedly? Jaffar, just tell me, how is Ghaznavi’s condition?
Is he okay? What does it matter to you? Your attempt to kill him failed, 
and he survived. What do you want to know? How many breaths 
has he left in his body? Don’t say that, don’t say that! Believe me, I didn’t poison Ghaznavi. The truth will come out once 
Saeein fully regains consciousness. So, that means he hasn’t 
regained consciousness yet? Please tell me, 
how is his condition? For now, he is fine. What are the doctors saying? All you need to know is that your attempt to kill him was unsuccessful. So, Ghaznavi has regained consciousness? He is still semi-conscious. Okay. You’re here? Won’t you invite me in? You live here, in this small house? It’s true what they say, girls who live in small houses dream big. Living in this empty house, you must have suppressed 
your desires quite a lot. But what surprises me is 
where you managed to reach, directly to Nosherwan Ghaznavi. Remarkable! Why are you here? Because you caused me pain, and when someone hurts me, I can’t tolerate it. I... I also want to hurt them. I caused you pain? You caused me pain by coming here. Everything was fine 
until you came here. Have you gone mad? Is everything ruined because of me 
or because of you? When someone comes between me 
and Nosherwan, I know how to get rid of them. Why don't you ease your pain 
by leaving Ghaznavi's life? Who leaves whose life, that’s something only time will tell. Wait, come in. She’s Dua, arrest her! What are you doing? Let go! -What has my daughter done?
-What have I done? Your innocent daughter tried 
to poison my husband, my guardian, by mixing poison in his food. She tried to kill him, and I’m having your innocent daughter
arrested for that. -Leave my daughter.
-I didn’t do anything. You didn’t do anything? I saw it with my own eyes. I’m an eyewitness, and I’ve already recorded my statement. You’re doing all of this, because you want to kick me 
out of Ghaznavi’s life. You can think whatever you want, it doesn’t matter to me, Dua. What you are doing is wrong. I’m doing wrong? I am doing wrong? You did wrong when you came
between me and Nosherwan. You poisoned his food and 
committed the crime, but I’m the one doing wrong? When you rot behind bars, then you’ll realize the mistake you made by 
coming between me and Nosherwan. Why are you just standing there? Arrest her! She’s a murderer. Leave me. -Dua!
-Mother, I’ll go myself. My daughter did nothing! Let’s go. -Leave her alone!
-Let’s go. My child, Dua, leave her. Leave my hand, 
I am coming with you myself. Dua! Do something! The police have taken my daughter! I don’t understand how the police 
could just take Dua like that. Her co-wife filed a case against her and that’s why the police took her. Do something, get up! I don’t understand, 
what should we do now? Let’s go to the police station 
and explain that our daughter did nothing. Who will listen to you? Without any witnesses or evidence, the police wouldn’t have arrested her. Her co-wife herself filed a case, so who’s going to listen to you? No, We should go, we will go. We have to go and tell them that 
our daughter is completely innocent. Aslam, we should go, 
we should go for our daughter. Go, bring my scarf quickly! Hurry! Get up. Hurry, girl! Faster. Let’s go. Be careful. Tell me, how did you poison him? I’ve already told you, 
I didn’t poison him! You have to tell me 
how you poisoned him. Whether Ghaznavi survives 
in the hospital or not, we’ll see later, but right now, you need 
to tell me how you did it. I already told you, 
I didn’t poison him. You tried to kill him! For what? Money? Women like you, who poison their husbands for money, either run away with their lovers or try to kill them with poison. I’ve told you before, 
I didn’t poison him. I didn’t try to kill Ghaznavi. Oh you will confess. Now that you’re here, you’d better get used to it. You’ll be staying here for a long time.
