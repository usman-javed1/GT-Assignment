[68.52] I have never clarified myself
in front of anyone ever,
[76.64] but it’s different when it comes to you.
[86.56] I can’t bear it when you are upset.
[94.20] That is why I had to create a proof.
[102.36] Watch it once,
[105.44] and if you still think I am guilty,
[109.24] I will accept whatever punishment
you want to give me.
[120.24] I thought you had especially
arranged this dinner for me.
[123.88] It is something like that.
[126.92] Mom?
[130.48] I tried a lot to make you understand
[132.44] that no one can take
Dua’s place in my life,
[134.80] there is no place for anyone.
[137.48] You told me your husband had divorced you,
[142.00] but you didn’t tell me
you also have a lovely son.
[144.96] What did you think?
[146.04] I would be so unaware that
I will trust whatever you say to me.
[151.72] I was trying to find your lie
since many days,
[156.56] and it is not difficult for me.
[158.20] If you were doing all this for me,
[161.00] you were doing wrong.
[163.28] I don’t have anything for you in my heart.
[165.24] I was just tolerating your madness
for the sake of humanity,
[170.32] as soon as I found a clue about Usama,
[172.64] I brought him in front of you.
[174.36] Go back to your husband and your son,
[178.20] I have nothing in my heart for you.
[201.80] I asked you to punish me,
[206.96] you got serious, dude.
[210.84] It’s not less than a punishment for
Ghaznavi to see tears in your eyes.
[220.56] What happened?
Why are you crying?
[224.16] Have I done something wrong?
[227.20] No,
[229.44] I am the one who did wrong.
[235.00] I put so many allegations against you
and doubted you so much
[240.76] but the truth was this,
[245.96] I am sorry.
[251.32] Okay, what would you do
if your doubt turned out to be true?
[259.20] I don’t know.
[261.68] I would have done something.
[263.08] Done what?
[270.48] Had you gone to Farah,
[274.04] then,
[275.48] I would have left you and
gone somewhere far away.
[291.64] Can you go far away from me?
[295.44] Maybe no.
[298.20] Maybe?
[303.40] No.
[306.12] No.
[322.60] I can’t go either,
[326.96] I am only yours forever.
[340.24] Sorry.
[377.56] Hey, daughter Fiza?
Hmm?
[379.72] Do everything in a proper manner.
[381.56] Nothing should look bad.
[382.68] Hey, nothing will happen,
[383.88] you are getting worried yourself
and confusing me as well.
[385.28] Everything is fine.
[386.80] My child, he is coming for the first time,
everything should be done nicely.
[389.88] They are here.
[390.80] Are they here?
[391.76] -Quickly, go.
-Yes, yes.
[393.68] Go, go, go.
[395.24] -Hey listen?
-What?
[396.48] What a hero sort of personality he has.
[397.92] Really?
[398.72] Come, come, let’s go, let’s go.
[400.88] Come, son, come.
[402.52] Come, come.
[405.16] Come, my child.
[406.20] Greetings.
[407.12] Greetings.
[407.96] That’s Mom.
[409.68] Stay blessed, son.
[412.36] And that’s Sania and Fiza.
[414.48] -Greetings.
-Greetings.
[415.88] Greetings.
[417.92] She has praised both of you
the most after Mom and Dad.
[425.76] She is praiseworthy herself.
[427.60] No. Less than you.
[429.48] Have a seat.
[430.72] Yes, thank you so much.
[432.64] You sit down as well, please.
[434.08] How are you?
[448.04] I was longing to meet you all,
[451.08] but I was unable to take out time
because of my busy work schedule.
[454.84] It hasn’t been late, son,
it hasn’t been late.
[457.44] Serve some cold or hot drink to him,
[459.12] our son-in-law has come
to our house for the first time.
[461.04] No, there is no rush,
[464.76] I will have food with you guys only.
[466.52] Why not, son?
This is your own house. Go.
[479.16] This marriage is a punishment for me,
[482.16] and it is the kind of punishment
I am not getting rid of.
[487.08] If you disliked me so much,
[490.08] you could have rejected this proposal.
[494.48] But no,
[496.88] if you disliked me,
[499.60] you would have told me at first sight.
[504.24] But Sarfaraz, you,
[507.00] you were so happy with me,
[510.28] so what happened all of a sudden?
[512.00] Right now, you don’t have so much value
[515.68] that you ask me a question,
do you understand?
[533.56] You are very lucky, sister,
[535.08] you have found such a hero.
[557.52] Sister-in-law, I am very happy.
[559.72] Tell me, what happened?
[561.32] Have sweets first.
[569.72] Now tell me
[570.92] why are you so happy?
[572.04] Khizar’s family agreed.
[574.12] They are coming for the
wedding ceremony this Friday.
[576.32] Really?
[579.96] So, then I should be feeding
you sweets as well. Have this.
[587.12] -Isn’t it good news?
-It is for sure.
[592.40] Are you happy?
Very happy.
[594.04] See, everything got fine.
[596.04] Everything got fine.
I told you so.
[603.88] Keep this, and how many pieces are in there?
[606.56] Keep this as well.
Where are Shami Kebabs?
[608.24] Yes, ma’am, they are in the back section.
[610.12] -Okay, bring them, please.
-Okay.
[612.84] Cooking oil is done as well,
Kebabs are here,
[616.24] I can’t see sela rice.
[619.44] The wedding date hasn’t been fixed yet,
and Mom gave this big list in our hands
[627.80] and has made this creature hound me.
[641.04] It is the limit!
[642.00] I’ve never been so frustrated in the heat.
[650.84] I can’t find sela rice. Wait here.
[715.60] Dua?
[717.60] Dua?
[718.68] You, you here?
[720.88] Fiza, who was this man with you?
[725.48] He?
[727.68] He is Sarfaraz, my husband,
your brother-in-law.
[740.92] He is coming.
[743.96] I am getting late,
I will meet you later.
[754.12] Who were you talking to?
[758.24] Who was she?
[760.24] I don’t know.
[761.20] She was asking for the medicine,
the pharmacy.
[764.00] Really?
[765.28] So, it means, you are the only one
she found in the whole market
[767.72] to ask where is the pharmacy.
[771.36] Who is she even asking?
[772.56] -Shall we go?
-Let’s go.
[806.92] Fiza, who was this man with you?
[809.36] He is Sarfaraz, my husband,
[811.84] your brother-in-law.
[813.48] Who came from their family?
And how were they?
[815.32] They were good noble people
and they really liked our Fiza.
[820.20] Our Fiza is very beautiful,
[822.48] anyone would like her.
[824.52] The boy is very handsome as well.
[827.36] Where did you guys see him?
[829.48] His mother brought a picture,
[832.44] he is very handsome,
[834.12] we really liked him and Fiza did too.
[838.52] Show me as well.
[839.76] Umm, sister Kausar took it back with her.
[842.84] I forgot to keep it,
I had to show it to your dad as well.
[847.24] Anyway, he will see him
when he will go there.
[849.84] So, you guys should have kept it for me.
[854.36] Okay, at least tell me the name.
[858.04] Sarfaraz.
[869.12] It would have been so nice
if Mom and Dad had taken us with them.
[872.88] We would have seen
the Brother Groom as well.
[874.40] Yes,
[875.52] you should be thankful Mom
and Dad didn’t listen to this
[878.52] otherwise, you would have gotten
a flying sandal coming towards you,
[881.16] and it would have been so much fun.
[883.48] By the way, brother's groom
is very handsome,
[886.44] Dad will like him too.
[894.04] I want to introduce you to Mom.
[896.08] Mom? Why?
[897.88] Because my marriage is being
discussed at home,
[901.24] I want you to meet Mom once
so she at least talks to Dad.
[905.44] Okay,
[906.72] give me some time to think.
[909.60] I will get married to someone else
meanwhile you take so much time to think.
[913.32] Do you know, I am very upset with you.
[915.84] Why me?
[917.72] You guys came with the picture
of Brother Groom the other day, right?
[920.28] But you guys took it back
without showing it to me.
[922.84] Umm, I am sorry, actually,
you weren’t there
[925.04] but I’ll make it up
for your complaint right now.
[927.28] How?
[929.04] I will show you
the pictures on my mobile.
[930.48] Oh, yes, I didn’t think of that.
[932.28] He keeps on making me click
his pictures all the time.
[934.40] He is so handsome and
so photogenic as well,
[936.64] his pictures come out so nice,
he is so good looking,
[939.04] I will show it to you,
he looks exactly like a hero.
[940.80] -Really?
-Let me show you.
[942.04] Yeah, this one, this one.
[945.72] The battery went low,
my mobile switched off, sorry.
[951.36] I will do one thing,
[952.40] I will go home and then I will come back
in two hours to pick you up.
[955.32] Where are you going?
Are you mad?
[957.48] Do you know if you
go home alone right now,
[959.76] Dad will be so angry,
[961.00] we already got permission to come
to the salon after so much difficulty.
[964.64] It’s better for me to go home and
help Mom rather than sitting here.
[972.96] You do know how Dad freaks her out.
[975.56] You are right, she is so emotional,
[978.88] she has been crying over every little thing.
[980.76] Come back before 2 hours,
I can’t sit alone here for so long.
[985.84] Faraz,
[987.24] I am getting very late,
[989.56] I have to get home before
the groom and family arrive.
[992.48] Hey, I know that,
[995.16] meet Mom and have juice
then we will leave.
[997.76] This is not needed.
[999.48] Dua?
[1000.52] You have come to my, not my home
[1002.64] but our home for the first time
[1005.48] and you know what Mom was saying?
[1007.08] She was saying that let your friend
go after having dinner.
[1009.28] No, no, this is enough.
[1026.40] Her in-laws are not nice at all.
[1029.24] Uncle and Sumbul are still bearable,
[1032.16] but Aunt and Brother Groom are very rude.
[1037.04] It’s just that sister has
a lot of tolerance in her,
[1041.00] they say so much to her
but sister doesn’t even sigh.
[1044.40] What is the problem with them?
[1045.96] Fiza is so nice.
[1047.60] If someone has suffered after
you left home, it’s sister Fiza.
[1052.88] They taunted her so much that
they made her life miserable.
[1079.72] If they get to know that
you have come back to us,
[1083.40] they might stop the sister from meeting us,
[1086.32] Brother Groom also
threatened to divorce Sister.
[1091.24] When you and I were about to become aunts,
[1093.64] Brother Groom made such filthy
allegations against Sister
[1096.64] that I feel Sister didn’t fall herself,
[1101.12] she was tripped up.
[1148.08] Show me the rice.
[1152.68] You guys took so long
for such less items, yeah?
[1156.44] Mom, they seem less items to you?
It took us all day to get them.
[1160.00] Mistakenly, I got a day off,
you gave me this big list.
[1163.68] I won’t go next time.
[1168.84] Hey,
[1170.12] what did I say to him that
he left like this?
[1173.56] I am sure you must have
demanded something.
[1176.60] When do I demand anything?
[1178.16] Madam, my hair didn’t turn grey
in the sunlight,
[1181.68] I know very well
[1183.24] when wives go out with their husbands,
their tastebuds are activated,
[1187.76] and they start making demands like,
chaat, stew, or lentil dumplings.
[1192.44] You must have demanded
something weird too,
[1195.32] that is why he got so cranky and left.
[1198.64] Yes.
[1200.44] Did you say something?
[1202.08] No, I am quiet.
[1204.44] So why are you standing quietly?
[1205.76] Pick all this up and
keep it in the kitchen.
[1210.12] And go easy on the oil,
[1212.80] it has become very expensive.
[1214.04] Okay.
[1215.68] Hurry up.
[1222.16] Slow motion.
[1229.32] Greetings, Sir.
[1231.04] Greetings.
[1232.48] Why are you taking this back?
[1234.20] Sir, madam has refused to eat.
[1237.52] She doesn’t seem well.
[1242.36] Okay, you may go.
I will check on her.
[1243.92] Okay, sir.
[1253.04] Dua?
[1254.64] -Hmm?
-What happened?
[1256.88] Nothing.
[1257.96] Are you unwell?
[1260.08] No,
[1261.20] nothing.
[1262.96] You don’t seem well to me, come,
let’s go to the doctor.
[1265.20] No, I just have a slight headache.
[1268.40] Headache?
[1270.72] Come, let’s go to the doctor.
[1272.16] Who goes to the doctor
for such slight pain?
[1274.92] I will take the medicine and get well.
[1279.28] Okay then take your medicine.
[1282.00] God forbid, if the pain doesn’t get
better in an hour, we will go then.
[1284.84] Hmm.
[1290.68] Why are you having a headache?
[1299.36] I didn’t ask the pain.
[1313.40] That’s it.
[1320.92] Shall I lie down for a while?
[1364.84] What must Dua be thinking?
[1367.44] I didn’t introduce her to Sarfaraz.
[1371.64] Sarfaraz is still unaware
that Dua has returned.
[1376.08] What if he finds out about Dua’s return?
[1380.08] He will make me cut ties with everyone,
[1384.92] or he will divorce me.
[1390.56] What should I do?
[1392.68] How should I get out of this trouble?
[1396.20] What will you find out? Huh?
[1398.84] That with who did she…
[1400.48] She didn’t do it,
how many times have I told you?
[1403.60] My sister Dua is not like that.
[1405.60] Enough!
[1407.08] Shut up!
[1409.32] If you take her name again,
I am telling you,
[1411.52] I will leave you forever.
[1417.32] -Sister-in-law?
-Hmm?
[1418.76] -Did I disturb you?
-No, no, come.
[1420.56] Okay, look, Khizar has sent some
pictures for the wedding outfit,
[1423.76] so please help me.
[1424.84] -Show.
-Okay,
[1426.08] this one, the color of this one
is very beautiful,
[1428.24] but this one is very beautiful itself, okay,
[1430.56] look at the second picture,
[1431.64] the color combination of this one
is very beautiful,
[1433.32] check out the embroidery, it is so beautiful.
[1434.88] Show me the first one.
[1436.12] This one?
[1437.36] Hmm. And second?
[1438.96] It’s embroidery.
[1441.36] This one is very nice,
this color will suit you a lot.
[1444.08] Right? I liked this one too.
Should I finalize it?
[1446.08] Immediately do it.
Okay, done.
[1449.00] You look so happy ever since
the wedding has been discussed.
[1452.44] Your face is glowing.
[1455.32] Why wouldn’t someone with such
a lovely sister-in-law be happy?
[1458.84] Everything happened so soon,
I still can’t believe it,
[1462.72] and all this happened
because of you.
[1466.92] You will get Khizar
if God has written him in your fate.
[1473.36] Sometimes I think
[1474.96] you love me exactly
like you love sister Dua.
[1477.56] Obviously.
[1479.40] She was so nice, so lovely.
[1482.80] I could only meet her once,
[1485.12] I don’t know how she would be,
where she would be.
[1487.40] She is in a very good condition.
[1490.24] How do you know? Where is she?
[1498.52] Dua has come back.
[1500.52] She has married a very rich man,
[1502.48] and Brother Ghaznavi is a very nice man.
[1504.24] He loves her so much,
and all of us have forgiven her as well.
[1506.76] What?
[1507.88] That’s an amazing news.
[1510.88] Hell will break loose if your mom
or Sarfaraz hears this.
[1515.84] Didn’t you tell Brother?
[1519.48] He doesn’t even like to hear her name.
[1523.32] True.
[1525.52] So then, what now?
[1529.16] That is what I am thinking,
what should I do?
[1532.64] What should I say?
[1535.76] If sister Dua has started
coming to your house
[1540.76] then Brother will get this news
[1543.36] and his reaction will be very bad
if he finds this out from elsewhere.
[1548.44] Before someone else tells him,
you should tell him.
[1551.20] In fact, do one thing,
take Dad into confidence,
[1554.36] Dad will talk to Brother and
your problem will be solved.
[1559.68] Yes.
[1561.28] I will do this
[1563.48] but not right now,
[1565.16] once you get married smoothly,
only after that.
[1567.84] I don’t want any hindrance
to your happiness.
[1570.92] See,
[1572.24] you are thinking about others
before yourself,
[1574.60] that is why I say you are precious.
[1578.08] Come on now look at other things.
[1579.76] -I…
-First, let me love you.
[1583.20] Help me select my jewelry too.
[1585.68] -Show me what you like.
-Let me show you.
[1588.08] Look,
[1589.52] this one, this one is very beautiful.
[1595.96] You would have been better by now
if I hadn't listened to you at that time
[1598.72] and called the doctor.
[1604.00] You also have a fever now.
[1606.64] Please turn off the AC,
[1609.08] I am feeling very cold.
[1613.52] Yes.
[1618.84] I have called the doctor,
he is just coming.
[1622.92] Sir, the doctor is here.
[1624.64] Immediately send him inside.
[1636.76] She is stressed out about something
[1641.00] and she is probably also
under some mental pressure.
[1645.04] What can be the stress about?
[1647.36] Get these medicines.
[1649.60] If her condition does not get better
[1651.28] and if she stays semi-conscious,
take her to the hospital immediately.
[1654.20] So, doctor, let’s take her
to the hospital right now.
[1655.96] For now, give her these medicines.
[1657.52] I hope she will get better with these,
[1661.64] and you will save yourself from
the hassle of going to the hospital.
[1664.68] Okay.
[1715.60] Okay, these are madam’s medicines,
[1717.56] take these to her home.
[1718.92] Okay.
[1722.68] Jaffar?
[1724.84] Yes sir?
[1726.76] What happened today?
[1729.52] Nothing special, sir.
[1732.80] So, what is your madam stressed about?
[1736.44] I don’t know, sir.
[1739.68] Hmm.
[1742.48] Where did your madam go today
and who did she meet?
[1747.48] Yes, she went to the store for some work
[1750.20] and she met her sister on her way back.
[1756.92] She met her sister?
[1759.72] Fiza?
[1761.32] Yes sir.
[1765.52] Hmm,
[1767.84] it means something must have
happened between them
[1770.52] because of which Dua is upset.
[1773.56] I can’t say anything.
[1776.48] Okay, you may go.
[1778.32] Okay.
[1941.88] She is stressed out about something
[1943.56] and she is probably also
under some mental pressure.
[1946.16] Yes, she went to the store for some work
[1949.00] and she met her sister on her way back.
[1976.68] How are you feeling now?
[1978.28] A lot better.
[1980.92] Good.
[1989.40] Umm, Sir, they are here.
[1992.80] Seat them, we will be there.
[1994.12] Okay sure.
[2000.16] Who has come so early in the morning?
[2002.08] Some special people,
