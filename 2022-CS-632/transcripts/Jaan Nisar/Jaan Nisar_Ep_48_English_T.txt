[48.56] Why are you repeatedly calling
when Jaffar told you I am busy?
[55.08] Are you so busy that
[57.04] you don’t even have
two minutes to talk to me?
[59.76] Yes, that’s how it is.
[65.08] You are hurting me.
[69.76] You have hurt me as well.
[75.04] I?
[77.60] When did I hurt you?
[83.36] Tell me, what do you want?
[85.96] I wanted to ask you,
[88.52] when are you coming back?
[90.96] My flight for today has been canceled.
[92.08] I will stay here for two to three days
and then come back.
[96.00] Two to three days?
[98.16] But why?
[100.16] You had your meetings
lined up till today, right?
[104.48] Yes, some extra work has come up.
[106.68] Okay.
[110.44] I miss you a lot.
[117.44] I thought I would go home with you.
[122.72] I can’t come today.
[125.48] Okay.
[127.84] But get done with your work soon.
[131.56] I will hang up now,
I will talk to you later.
[133.16] Okay, listen,
[137.76] I love you.
[153.00] Won’t you reply?
[186.68] Madam used to love Sarfaraz.
[212.32] Yes, my child, are you done talking?
[216.12] Yes.
[216.80] So, then you call him here.
[218.56] Have dinner here and
then you guys can leave.
[223.84] No, Mom, he is not coming today,
[231.24] he will return in two to three days.
[234.28] Why? How come all of a sudden?
[236.08] Is everything okay?
[239.12] Yes, everything is fine.
[241.00] He said there’s some work, an emergency.
[244.08] that’s why.
[245.76] Okay, fine, he must finish his work.
[250.40] Mom,
[252.20] I wanted to go home.
[255.88] Why, my child?
Is there a problem here?
[258.68] No, no, there is no problem.
[260.88] So, my child,
what will you do alone at home?
[263.20] You can go with Ghaznavi
when he comes back.
[266.40] Umm,
[268.72] I had to get a few things
[270.44] so I thought of going there
and bringing them myself.
[272.20] Okay, fine.
[273.48] How will you go?
[274.64] Shall I ask your dad to take you?
[276.84] You can also come back with him.
[278.64] Hey, no, no,
[279.56] there is no need to bother Dad.
[281.64] I will call the driver
[283.16] so he will take me and
bring me back as well.
[285.68] Okay, whatever is feasible to you.
[287.56] Come.
[297.44] Sir,
[299.52] you must eat.
[306.44] No, Jaffar, I am not hungry.
[312.92] Sir, you will get unwell like this.
[319.24] No,
[322.48] I am not so weak.
[329.40] You don’t worry about me.
[331.28] Don’t say something
which is not in my control, sir.
[336.08] There must be some solution to it, sir.
[341.48] I am unable to find
a solution to this problem.
[358.00] Sir, why are you quiet?
[363.08] You must talk to Madam,
[366.92] ask her.
[369.16] I don’t want to ask her anything.
[377.00] If she tells everything herself,
well and good.
[383.16] I won’t ask her anything.
[385.56] But Sir that would be your loss.
[392.92] Jaffar, after knowing that killing truth,
[398.68] what else can I lose?
[409.12] Whenever I asked
Dua about that man
[414.48] or thought about bringing an end to him,
[420.56] Dua always eluded
the matter by saying that
[422.56] she didn’t want to talk
anything about her past
[431.20] and when the past has walked
right in front of her today,
[436.76] she is misleading me
without any shame.
[443.60] It clearly shows she was trying
to save Sarfaraz since forever,
[452.04] she was lying to me.
[453.96] No, Sir, madam might be helpless.
[464.56] Sarfaraz turned out to be her brother-in-law,
[466.52] she might be hiding the truth from
everyone because of this.
[470.64] There is a huge difference between me
and everyone, Jaffar.
[479.28] How can she lie to me?
[482.68] Doesn’t she trust me?
[485.04] I can find out the reason why madam
hid the truth from you if you say so.
[490.60] You won’t ask anything from her,
[497.36] let her hide everything if she wants to.
[505.84] Don’t let her know that we know the truth.
[516.80] Let her hide it.
[519.56] Whatever you say.
[521.68] You may go now.
[540.88] It doesn’t matter to me who was in your
life before me or who wasn’t,
[550.00] you shouldn’t have a place for anyone
in your life except me from today onwards,
[554.96] hmm?
[559.52] Trust me as much as you trust yourself,
[568.76] I will never embarrass you.
[575.44] You cannot be disloyal.
[578.04] But if this is not disloyalty then what is it?
[602.44] Greetings, Sister-in-law,
[603.24] how are you?
[604.84] Greetings,
[606.72] I didn’t realize when you came.
[608.92] I just came a while ago, Sister-in-law.
[611.96] You must be here to meet Sumbul,
[613.56] please sit down, I will call her.
[615.80] Sister-in-law,
[623.08] like Brother Sarfaraz, do you also
not like that I come here?
[628.48] There is nothing like that.
[631.56] There is something, Sister-in-law,
[636.40] you start panicking when I come here
[638.84] and then you go elsewhere.
[643.76] Has Brother Sarfaraz asked you to do so?
[646.64] What are you doing here?
[652.80] I came here for some work
[654.52] when I saw Khizer sitting over here…
[656.00] So?
[658.04] Are you done seeing him?
[659.32] You may go now.
[672.84] What is this tone that you are
talking to Sister-in-law in?
[674.80] I am using the tone she will understand.
[678.00] Behave yourself, Sumbul,
[679.96] she is your sister-in-law.
[680.96] Both of you need to take
this reality seriously.
[686.44] What are you trying to say?
[687.76] That she is my sister-in-law,
[689.52] I know how to deal with her.
[692.60] I guess you are forgetting
[695.60] that we are together because
of your sister-in-law
[697.52] and we got married because of her.
[698.52] So, should I give her an award for it
[699.88] like you keep on giving her
by praising her all the time?
[705.52] There is not a single day when
[706.48] I don’t listen to a lecture on
the qualities of my sister-in-law.
[709.36] You look like a literal picture
of your brother right now,
[713.40] you are talking the same way.
[715.12] I will be like him,
[716.32] I will be the literal picture of my brother.
[721.60] When you make Sister-in-law
stand in front of me,
[723.48] I won’t stay quiet as well.
[724.68] Enough!
[727.48] I cannot tolerate this pathetic mentality
of yours anymore now.
[731.36] Contact me when you change your mentality.
[734.16] My mentality won’t change.
[736.44] Thank you
[739.84] for letting me know.
[744.92] I should reconsider my decision.
[751.04] The girl who has changed
so much after the wedding,
[758.84] how much more will she and
her behavior change after the marriage?
[762.96] What?
[764.96] What do you mean?
[766.48] You will find out whatever I mean.
[771.24] Answer, no, answer me before you leave.
[772.76] Khizer, answer me before you leave.
[773.92] Will you break up with me?
[775.40] Answer me before you leave, Khizer.
[776.80] Will you break up with me over this issue?
[778.84] Khizer?
[799.00] Where are you going?
[800.68] I am going to Mom’s place to meet Dua.
[802.84] What do you want?
[805.12] What happened, Sumbul?
[806.96] What do you want?
[808.56] Do you want me to get divorced?
[810.12] Do you want Khizer to leave me?
[812.08] Why would I want this?
[813.56] Maybe, your sisters are like that by nature.
[817.16] Now you are doing wrong, Sumbul.
[818.60] Am I doing wrong
[819.80] or are you coming between Khizer and I?
[822.36] Why would I come between both of you?
[824.28] Why do you like coming
in front of Khizer so much?
[826.72] When I have asked you
not to come in front of Khizer,
[829.40] you still come in front of him.
[830.76] I was coincidentally passing by,
[832.48] had I known Khizer was there,
[834.24] I would have never gone there.
[834.88] Yes,
[836.68] you are so great!
[839.00] You want me to get divorced
[841.40] and congratulations,
[843.12] Khizer has threatened me.
[845.20] What?
[847.08] How could he say something so big?
[850.08] Sumbul, you don’t worry, I, I will talk…
[851.72] Don’t you dare,
[853.32] don’t you dare talk to Khizer.
[855.96] Don’t come between Khizer
and me now.
[859.12] And I will make your life miserable
if Khizer divorces me.
[864.84] I won’t let you live in peace anywhere as well,
[867.08] do you understand?
[895.20] Ghaznavi will come back after a few days,
[896.64] I will also return then,
[899.20] meanwhile, you guys have to
take care of the house.
[901.84] Yes, Madam.
[903.52] Okay tell me,
[904.36] did someone come to meet
us in our absence
[906.80] or any call for us?
[908.36] No, madam, no one came
[910.80] but there were a few calls for Sir
[913.72] so I informed Mr. Jaffar.
[917.76] Okay,
[919.04] you guys may go now,
carry on with your work.
[956.40] Umm, excuse me.
[959.52] Hello, Jaffar.
[960.44] Greetings, Madam.
[962.36] Greetings.
[963.92] Umm,
[964.56] Ghaznavi is not attending my call,
[966.28] where is he?
[966.96] Umm,
[968.00] he, umm, he just left for the meeting.
[971.64] For the meeting?
[973.24] Aren’t you with him?
[974.84] Yes, I, I am just leaving.
[978.16] What do you mean by you are just leaving?
[979.68] You know he has a lot of enemies,
[981.80] you must always stay with him like a shadow.
[984.48] Yes, whatever you say.
[986.08] Go, immediately go to him,
[987.76] and don’t leave him alone.
[989.72] Yes, yes, Madam.
[991.68] Make me talk to him once
he gets free from the meeting.
[994.64] Okay, sure, Madam.
[1027.20] Sir,
[1029.60] Madam called.
[1033.48] What was she saying?
[1035.48] She was asking about you,
[1037.88] when I told her you had
left for the meeting,
[1040.36] she started getting angry at me
as to why I let you go alone,
[1046.64] I should have been
with you like your shadow.
[1053.32] She does care a lot about me.
[1055.68] Sir,
[1058.44] I am not convinced that
[1060.24] madam is betraying you.
[1065.40] At least, try talking to her once.
[1145.76] You?
[1147.28] What do you want?
[1148.16] Inform madam, that Sarfaraz
is here to meet her.
[1150.52] Regarding what?
[1152.16] I will tell that to her.
[1154.12] I am her brother-in-law,
[1155.80] go tell her I am here.
[1158.40] Younas.
[1161.32] Tell madam that her brother-in-law
Mr. Sarfaraz is here
[1163.80] and wants to meet her.
[1164.84] Okay.
[1187.20] Madam,
[1188.64] your brother-in-law Mr. Sarfaraz is here.
[1192.16] Sarfaraz has come here?
[1196.52] Okay,
[1199.00] go seat him down, I am coming.
[1200.84] Okay, madam.
[1211.92] Madam is asking to send him inside.
[1214.52] Sir, please, you may go.
[1215.48] Sir, please, come.
[1242.36] Your house is very beautiful.
[1245.76] How can the choice of
Nosherwan Ghaznavi be ordinary?
[1248.60] No, no, it’s legit worth being praised,
[1249.96] it definitely is.
[1254.92] By the way, you must be thankful to me
[1256.56] for living in this luxurious house.
[1262.52] Hadn’t I left you in that
apartment the other night,
[1266.84] you might still be living in
that small house of your dad
[1269.64] or you would have been married
to some middle-class man
[1271.92] and you would have been
taking care of his children
[1277.84] but that didn’t happen, you,
[1279.72] look,
[1280.76] you are living in this luxurious house
[1289.32] because of me, right?
[1291.92] Why have you come here?
[1296.76] I went to drop Fiza home
[1299.16] so I found out that you are here and
[1301.96] I also got this news from the office that
[1304.36] Boss won’t be here for three to four days,
[1309.24] so I came here.
[1312.08] What is the purpose of coming here?
[1314.36] You are the purpose.
[1317.76] Go away from here and never come again.
[1319.44] No, no, no,
[1321.88] I will keep on coming and
no one can stop me.
[1329.56] It won’t be nice if Fiza
finds out anything about this.
[1334.36] So, what do you think?
[1335.20] Does it make any difference
to me if she finds out?
[1338.36] I don’t care whether her
heart is broken or mended.
[1344.96] What do you want?
[1349.12] I want you.
[1354.88] I want to spend some time with you,
[1357.56] now, you decide the place,
[1359.96] though I don’t have any
objection in meeting you here,
[1363.20] I just want to spend some time.
[1370.56] Did you get the answer?
[1381.24] This is not needed at all.
[1387.76] He will have tea at his home.
[1393.24] Take him out.
[1421.08] Sarfaraz came home,
[1422.48] madam slapped him and
got him out of the house.
[1425.28] Madam came home for a while and
[1427.28] then she went to her mother’s place.
[1429.16] Ask your guards to be with madam
like her shadow till I get there,
[1432.88] I won’t bear any negligence.
[1434.64] Okay, I will do it right now.
[1472.00] Greetings, Brother Sarfaraz.
[1473.60] Come. Come.
[1483.12] Greetings,
[1484.20] -come.
-Greetings.
[1485.48] Greetings.
[1486.20] Sit down, please.
[1497.24] Have food.
[1498.76] I won’t have food.
[1504.36] Tea,
[1504.96] shall I get tea made for you?
Sania will make good tea.
[1508.04] Yes, I will have tea.
[1511.72] I will make tea for you.
[1516.48] Umm,
[1517.64] I will make it myself.
[1550.88] I will go to Fiza.
[1573.56] Leave my way.
[1577.72] I won’t easily forget what
you have done today.
[1583.56] I will leave you there at the same place
[1585.24] and you won’t safely
come out of it this time,
[1587.32] do you understand?
[1591.20] What’s about to happen to
you won’t be good.
[1596.84] What I have done today,
[1599.72] I should have done it way before.
[1603.32] You just take care of your sister now
[1610.24] because I will tell her,
[1611.20] I will tell your family, I will tell everyone
[1613.56] that it was me who
you used to secretly meet
[1621.96] and it was me because of whom
your father threw you out of the house.
[1630.76] Have you forgotten that night?
[1652.12] Fiza?
[1655.04] Fiza?
[1658.84] Fiza, listen to me?
[1660.40] Fiza?
[1661.52] Fiza,
[1662.20] look at me. Fiza?
[1665.60] Fiza, listen to me,
[1667.32] it’s not what you think it is,
[1669.24] I will tell you everything, I will explain.
[1686.76] Enough Fiza.
[1687.84] Such a huge betrayal.
[1689.32] Okay, enough.
[1690.36] It was my husband who made
my sister’s life miserable?
[1694.56] No, Fiza, no.
[1695.68] What will I do now?
[1704.16] Please, enough,
I am unable to bear it. Please.
[1706.48] I, how will I bear all this?
[1708.92] Yeah?
[1722.24] My love,
[1724.16] I hid all this from you to save your home,
[1731.28] forgive me, it’s my mistake.
[1733.24] I was unaware but he wasn’t.
[1736.64] Dua, he is my sinner and yours as well.
[1739.04] Fiza?
[1739.72] Where is he?
[1740.64] I… Fiza? Fiza?
[1741.40] Where is he?
[1741.96] Fiza, listen to me.
[1742.84] Leave me, I want to talk to him.
[1744.48] Fiza?
[1745.04] My child?
[1745.88] Listen to me, my child.
[1747.64] Sarfaraz?
[1748.72] Fiza? Fiza?
[1750.08] The coward ran away.
[1751.84] He ran away.
[1752.52] Fiza?
[1755.20] I am your sinner.
[1757.60] Don’t do this to yourself.
[1758.88] No, no, Dad?
[1760.72] Dad, call him,
[1762.00] I want to talk to him.
[1771.88] I will go and talk to him myself.
[1772.84] Fiza? Fiza?
[1774.88] Come out of this craziness.
[1782.00] You are not going anywhere, my child.
[1783.12] No, Mom, let me go,
[1786.32] I will have to go.
[1788.04] This man hasn’t given me
a single day of peace
[1790.92] and should I just let him go after
knowing the whole truth today?
[1794.00] No,
[1794.48] I won’t spare that coward, Mom.
[1796.00] Fiza?
[1802.44] You won’t go there alone,
[1805.92] all of us will come with you.
[1836.88] You are coming alone such late at night?
[1838.40] Where is your wife?
[1840.52] She is at her mother’s house.
[1841.92] Hey?
[1842.48] Who did she get
permission from to stay there?
[1846.72] What happened to him?
[1848.72] He went without informing.
[1850.84] What do I know?
[1851.88] Ask your daughter-in-law.
[1856.96] I pray she never comes back here.
[1860.44] My issues with Khizer can never
be resolved if she comes back.
[1868.64] He just patched up after
so much difficulty.
[1870.56] That is the problem with you guys
[1875.40] when it’s all love,
[1877.72] everything seems right
[1883.28] and as soon as you guys get married,
[1885.16] you start seeing flaws in each other.
[1890.84] You guys start fighting like cats
and dogs with each other.
[1897.04] No matter what happens,
[1899.52] poor Fiza is suffering
because of your issues.
[1907.36] You are still supporting Sister-in-law?
[1910.32] I am being honest.
[1914.44] I can identify what’s genuine
and what’s spurious.
[1916.80] I can see
[1918.32] you have been defending
your daughter-in-law a lot these days.
[1938.84] What will happen now?
Fiza has found out everything,
[1942.84] how will I get out of this trouble?
[1952.72] It won’t be nice if Fiza
finds out anything about this.
[1957.52] So, what do you think?
[1958.44] Does it make any difference
to me if she finds out?
[1961.60] I don’t care whether
her heart is broken or mended.
[1968.04] What do you want?
[1972.24] I want you.
[1979.04] Sarfaraz?
[1981.44] Sarfaraz?
[1983.52] Sarfaraz?
[1984.88] Come out, Sarfaraz.
[1990.84] Sarfaraz?
[1993.12] What happened, my child?
[1995.16] Why are you shouting?
[2001.48] You call your son,
[2003.36] ask him to come in front of me.
[2011.20] The one whom you call your son,
[2015.96] he has ruined the lives
of both my daughters.
[2031.12] It was your son who pushed my daughter Dua in
a marsh of defamation in the name of love,
[2043.00] your son.
[2044.52] your son.
[2050.08] Your son kept on raising
