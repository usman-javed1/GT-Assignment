[23.48] Hey, Fiza,
[25.00] where is the fried flatbread?
[26.52] Why is it taking so long?
[35.96] Does it take so long to make fried flatbread?
[41.28] And what is this?
[42.64] You are still not ready.
[44.04] Don’t you have to go to school?
[45.52] I am a little unwell.
[52.96] Yes.
[54.88] This is a good excuse to not go to school.
[57.88] Although, you know
[60.00] that the salary gets deducted
by not going to school.
[71.44] Fiza, child, if you were not well, then
[75.24] you should have asked Mama or Sumbul,
[77.08] they would have made breakfast.
[79.64] How could she?
[81.20] It's Sister-in-law's habit to play the victim
[91.44] and get others to praise her.
[98.72] How are you talking to your sister-in-law?
[101.32] Hmm?
[102.04] It seems like you only see
our ways and manners.
[110.84] But you are unable to see
[112.40] how Khizar taunts Sumbul
while praising her skills.
[126.24] He keeps taunting
her all the time that
[128.64] she has turned her
sister-in-law into a servant,
[131.64] saying she should do some
of the work herself too.
[143.76] I don’t understand
[145.88] how all this information reaches Khizar.
[155.00] Listen,
[156.72] neither is Khizar blind nor is he deaf.
[163.68] If she keeps on talking to him
on the phone all day long,
[166.32] then obviously, he can also judge that
[168.68] she doesn’t have time
to do anything else.
[175.80] He is an intelligent boy
[177.56] and on top of that,
he is also in the police.
[187.80] Before you say anything to anyone,
[189.60] why don’t you make
Sumbul understand?
[191.84] Teach her some skills too.
[199.28] You have put all the burden on Fiza.
[202.40] She goes to school
[203.52] and then takes care of the chores
after coming home as well.
[206.24] How is this justice?
[214.92] Look at her condition.
[217.88] Child,
[219.56] you have breakfast and then
[221.08] go to your room and rest.
[233.56] Sumbul will manage all
the work in the kitchen today.
[254.80] What life partner?
[257.12] You don’t realize my pain even a little.
[284.00] So?
[286.96] What did you decide?
[290.96] What do I have to decide?
[294.48] Don’t drive me mad coming
here again and again.
[296.56] Do you understand?
[299.72] You wanted to meet me, right?
[305.80] That’s why you also came to my home.
[311.44] So, I thought I would
come here to meet you.
[315.72] Do you not like it?
[319.88] Don’t test my patience.
[324.84] Do you understand?
[327.20] Or else if I do something
wrong with your sister,
[329.44] then you will regret it.
[334.88] Are you threatening me?
[336.20] No,
[337.84] I am not threatening you.
[343.20] I can also do what I am saying.
[352.48] After all,
[354.20] since I have found out
she is your sister,
[356.88] I have kept her on the toe of my shoe.
[362.32] If I divorce her,
[364.52] then your sister will not
be left with anything.
[368.44] Will you divorce her?
[374.96] Do it.
[377.88] Yes, I will divorce her.
[380.72] I will divorce her really soon.
[385.80] Do you think I will spare
your sister if you hurt mine?
[394.08] How did you think of this?
[397.84] You won’t do anything like that.
[399.92] You are mistaken
[405.08] or maybe you are challenging
my position in your stupidity.
[418.04] You cannot even think what Ghaznavi
will do to you and your family on my instructions.
[437.68] Hmm...
[438.24] And then, Sumbul.
[441.64] I will have to tell Sumbul’s in-laws
about your character.
[448.44] Then,
[450.84] she will get divorced.
[457.16] Then your sister will not
be left with anything.
[462.80] Look Dua, whatever it is, is between us.
[464.84] Don’t drag my sister into this.
[469.96] You will not do anything like this.
[471.48] Who will stop me?
[476.44] You?
[488.60] The meeting is after lunch, right?
[489.92] Yes.
[490.56] I am going home.
[491.44] You line up everything.
[492.44] Okay, sir.
[499.08] Send Jaffar inside.
[505.04] If you want your sister’s home to remain
[510.36] or the little respect you have left, remains,
[515.72] then fix your behaviour towards Fiza.
[524.20] If you hurt her even a little,
[529.28] then I will hurt you in such ways
[534.92] that you cannot even imagine.
[550.20] I am telling you this for the last time.
[557.84] I can even take your life for Fiza.
[594.60] Yes, sir?
[595.88] I have to go home for lunch.
[598.08] Home?
[599.60] But madam is at the office.
[604.52] She is at the office? Where is she?
[606.56] In Sarfaraz’s cabin.
[613.44] Can I come inside?
[618.12] Do you need permission?
[622.16] You will tell me this.
[627.84] What is the matter? Nowadays,
you come to the office daily.
[630.72] I was getting bored at home,
[634.80] so I came.
[637.08] If you have an objection,
then I will not come.
[640.92] Hey, when did I say that?
[644.64] Okay, you wait here, we will have
lunch from outside and come.
[646.40] There is no need for that.
[647.96] We will have lunch in the office.
[652.00] That is also right.
[653.64] Order lunch, we will have it here.
[655.36] There is no need for that either.
[657.64] I brought lunch from home.
[660.40] The driver will bring it soon.
[665.52] Sure. I will see.
[669.32] Hmm.
[670.44] Hmmm.
[671.36] Is everything alright?
[671.96] You are really taking care
of your husband’s diet.
[676.76] You have to,
[678.64] when the husband is like this.
[680.80] By the way, you can
also consider this my raid.
[686.40] You know, I hadn’t thought of it like this,
[687.92] that my missus can also doubt me.
[691.28] Then think now.
[692.80] After all,
[693.48] I have a lot of time.
[695.40] I have come with
a lot of time on my hands.
[697.60] This means, no work will be
done all day long today.
[700.64] Not at all.
[702.00] You comfortably work,
[703.36] and I will sit and look at you.
[707.72] Then this will be
the work I do all day long.
[716.96] What did you bring for lunch?
[719.48] The things you like.
[759.20] Earlier, I could have even forgiven
you for the sake of my sister.
[763.16] But, no.
[764.60] Now, I will make you pay for every
single suffering of my sister.
[772.12] You ruined my respect.
[775.24] You humiliated Fiza in
the name of being your wife.
[781.28] Really,
[782.76] her crime is really big,
[785.04] that she married a cheap man like you.
[790.76] You have played enough
with all our respects.
[794.60] Now your game is over.
[797.88] Now I will tell you
[799.68] what you call respect being ruined.
[834.12] May I come in, sir?
[835.68] Sarfaraz. Come.
[839.32] Please, have a seat.
[843.32] What will you have? Tea or coffee?
[844.60] No, sir. Thank you.
[847.24] Why, man?
[848.60] You are also my relative because
of our relationship through Fiza.
[850.52] Tell me, what will you have?
[851.72] No, I am fine.
[854.20] I wanted to talk to you
about something important.
[857.68] Yes, sure.
[862.52] Tell me, what is the issue?
[868.00] The issue is not with me.
[869.20] The issue is with Dua.
[877.68] The issue is with Dua, meaning?
[880.24] What do you want to say?
Say it clearly.
[887.12] Look,
[887.96] I think you only know
Dua as my sister-in-law, but…
[899.32] The thing is that she had run away
with some boy on the day of my wedding,
[907.36] and the police recovered her from a flat…
[909.68] How is all this related to you?
[915.08] I want to tell you that
[919.96] the girl you accepted being
so pure and decent,
[925.28] in reality, she has a really bad character…
[927.68] Stop your nonsense.
[936.04] Had you not been sitting here in front
of me as Dua’s brother-in-law,
[941.48] I would have cut your tongue.
[947.12] In the future,
[950.00] mention Dua after thinking hard.
[959.24] And remember,
[961.80] I only forgive once.
[970.84] Get lost.
[1080.36] Why are you doing all this?
Ask a servant.
[1082.60] Why should I ask a servant?
[1084.56] I like doing your work.
[1087.44] I get happiness.
[1089.44] Okay, then you can be happy.
[1092.92] When will you come back?
[1095.28] it will take two to three days.
[1097.60] If you are in the mood,
then come along.
[1099.24] No,
[1100.84] hearing your schedule
gave me a headache.
[1103.56] You have such a busy schedule.
[1105.72] I mean,
[1106.92] what will I do there? I will get bored.
[1110.12] Yes, that’s why I am not forcing you.
[1112.96] First, I have two meetings in Lahore,
then in Islamabad,
[1116.16] and if I get free early on the third day,
[1117.52] then I will come back.
[1120.12] Do come.
[1122.00] After all,
[1123.32] what will I do alone without you?
[1126.92] Why alone?
[1129.04] If you want, you can go
to your mother’s home.
[1132.20] Yes, that’s a good idea.
[1134.96] It has been a long time since
I stayed with her overnight.
[1142.24] But you will forget me going there.
[1145.48] Hmmm.
[1150.96] Are you something
that can be forgotten,
[1152.68] that I will forget you?
[1155.00] You will see,
[1156.24] I will make so many calls and
send you so many messages,
[1159.64] that you will get worried
between meetings.
[1163.04] Will you miss me?
[1166.80] A little.
[1169.88] Just a little?
[1171.48] Yes.
[1177.68] A lot more than a little.
[1180.84] Because a little will not work for me.
[1185.96] I too will miss you a lot.
[1231.48] Thank you.
[1234.80] Hey, since I have heard
[1236.12] that you are coming over to stay,
I am elated.
[1239.72] We will have a lot of fun like earlier, and
[1242.64] this time we will also dance together.
[1244.60] Uh-huh.
[1247.80] I have stopped being stupid.
[1251.00] Oh, why?
[1252.56] You remember when you had bought
a radio from the scrap-seller
[1255.76] and Papa broke it.
[1260.40] Where is this sound of
music coming from?
[1261.96] Oh God,
[1263.48] this box of nuisance is in my home?
[1266.88] How did it come in this home?
[1268.56] Hey, why did you not stop her by slapping
her ten times and turning her face red?
[1272.88] Mama, had told me not to.
[1273.88] She scolded me a lot, as well.
She scolded me a lot.
[1275.48] Hey, God damn it,
[1277.44] music is being played in
the home of Akram’s son.
[1280.64] I made a mistake. Sorry.
[1281.52] Hey, you made a mistake.
[1286.64] I remember everything.
[1288.72] Mama,
[1290.44] it would have been so good had
Sister also come over to stay.
[1295.72] Really!
[1297.40] Will you just sit here and talk?
[1299.28] Go,
[1300.48] and put water on the stove for tea.
[1303.08] I will go.
[1308.56] You send her again and again.
[1310.92] She talks so much.
[1312.60] Yes, she talks so much.
[1316.92] Child, even I wanted that
[1319.60] Fiza would have come to
stay here for a few days.
[1321.80] She would have stayed.
[1322.68] She would have rested.
[1324.32] She needs to rest.
[1329.12] Her in-laws don’t care for her at all.
[1334.40] Why?
[1336.32] What happened to Fiza?
[1342.72] Mama,
[1347.76] is she fine?
[1349.64] Yes. Yes. She is fine.
[1352.36] Thankfully, you will soon be an aunt
and I will be a grandmother.
[1365.28] Her in-laws don’t care about her.
[1379.52] I don’t know if she has told anyone or not.
[1386.68] When I talked about coming along with her,
[1388.36] she stopped me.
[1390.40] She said she would talk to them herself.
[1398.28] After that, she didn’t come here.
[1406.64] May God make everything easy for her.
[1409.80] Mama.
[1430.36] Hmmm.
[1431.92] By the way, I had an idea of this that
[1433.36] as soon as Ghaznavi leaves this city,
[1436.20] you will think of me.
[1438.40] Ghaznavi and you?
[1443.64] There is no comparison between you two.
[1449.80] Don’t ever think about it.
[1457.64] Yes, I got an idea about this.
[1460.32] When I tried to tell him your reality,
[1465.32] he humiliated me badly.
[1467.52] He dragged me out of the room.
[1474.36] Then you must have realized by now
[1479.12] that your objective is not
going to be fulfilled here.
[1486.00] Hmmm.
[1487.96] Just think,
[1491.12] Ghaznavi dragged you out
on just taking my name.
[1499.80] If he finds out what your reality is,
[1505.04] what will he do to you?
[1508.48] So, you called me
here to threaten me?
[1512.16] No,
[1514.20] I just called to here tell you to
fix your behaviour towards Fiza.
[1524.28] Give her the same love and
respect that a wife deserves.
[1529.84] And if I don’t, then?
[1532.44] Hmmm…
[1533.80] then I will have to tell everyone,
everything, out of helplessness.
[1537.16] Just think,
[1538.56] if I tell everyone everything,
[1540.00] then that will also reach
your sister’s in-laws,
[1547.56] and then
[1549.68] your father will not be left
capable of facing anyone.
[1557.48] When the fire that you had escaped so easily
[1562.28] from reaches your own home,
[1564.20] how will you run from it?
[1569.12] You will do all this?
[1573.56] Yes.
[1577.28] Fine, and Fiza?
[1579.36] Did you not think about her?
[1585.32] when she finds out that
[1588.20] the boy her sister had an affair with,
is her husband?
[1596.40] Hmm?
[1598.00] How will she feel?
[1607.48] By the way, between us,
those days were really good.
[1614.88] But, when Fiza finds
out about this reality,
[1618.72] then that poor thing will die of shock.
[1624.76] Hey, that poor thing
doesn’t even know that
[1626.92] you and I have come face to face.
[1635.84] And I challenge you
[1638.56] to ask her to introduce
you to her husband.
[1647.08] Or tell your family to
come in front of my family
[1650.28] and say that they
have accepted you.
[1655.08] No one will do anything like this.
[1658.56] You were weak yesterday and
you are even weak today.
[1668.12] Don’t try to threaten me like this again.
[1672.24] I am willing to forget everything for Fiza.
[1681.32] I will not even utter your name.
[1688.76] I will not harm you,
but you please keep Fiza happy.
[1700.72] I will go now.
[1702.64] But remember one thing,
[1705.96] I am not your slave
[1708.72] that I will do what you tell me to do.
[1711.64] I will follow your path.
[1719.28] Don’t threaten me in the future
[1721.68] or else I will have to tell
everything to Fiza out of helplessness.
[1727.88] Do you understand?
[1730.24] You will have to do all this
[1733.12] because Fiza is going to
be the mother of your child.
[1811.08] Greetings.
[1812.72] Greetings.
[1815.08] How are you?
[1816.76] I am good. How are you?
[1819.76] Are you missing me?
[1823.08] A lot.
[1825.88] I too am missing you a lot.
[1828.24] How are your meetings going?
[1830.20] Yes, they were good.
[1832.16] When will you come back?
[1834.00] I am not sure, man.
[1836.16] Either tomorrow or the day after.
[1838.12] A delegation has to come,
but they still haven’t arrived.
[1840.52] Everyone is waiting for them.
[1842.56] Fine.
[1844.32] But don’t forget to eat
getting busy with work.
[1847.80] Don’t worry, everything is on time.
[1850.20] Jaffar is with me.
[1851.88] By the way, was he not enough alone
[1853.28] that you have given
him special instructions?
[1854.68] He has become a pain for me.
[1856.88] It is good.
[1858.68] If not me,
[1860.12] then Jaffar.
[1861.80] Someone should be
with you to take care of you.
[1865.72] Yes, Madam, if not you,
then your bodyguard is there.
[1869.00] I hope you are not getting bored.
[1870.44] No,
[1872.00] I am having a good time with everyone.
[1874.12] Hmm
[1875.64] You didn’t go out anywhere?
[1879.96] No.
[1881.08] And why did you send the guards
and the driver back?
[1884.16] I had said they would stay there.
[1886.16] Ghanznavi,
[1888.08] this is a neighbourhood.
[1889.92] People get worried,
and there is no place here either.
[1893.40] The poor things stand out in the sun,
[1895.12] I don’t like it.
[1896.96] If there is a need, I will call them.
[1899.04] That’s why I sent them.
[1901.84] Hmmm.
[1903.16] I have thought of a solution for this too.
[1906.04] What?
[1907.76] You take your entire family
and go out somewhere.
[1911.32] I will ask the driver,
he will take you, people.
[1915.28] Fine. If I have to go, I will call him.
[1918.84] I am telling you, just go.
[1920.68] Should I call the driver?
[1922.00] Plan to go anywhere.
[1925.28] Okay, fine.
[1926.64] I will plan something.
[1928.24] Okay.
[1929.72] Okay, my next meeting is about to start.
[1931.76] I will call you when I get free.
[1934.20] Okay. Listen.
[1937.12] Take care.
[1938.52] You too.
[1940.48] I love you.
