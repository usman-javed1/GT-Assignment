[21.27] How are you feeling now Nosherwan?
[28.83] Where is Dua?
[36.03] Ah,
[38.83] your health isn’t good right now, dear.
[41.47] You need rest. Rest now.
[49.23] Take it easy,
[50.87] take it easy.
[53.17] I’m fine now, Baba Saeein,
[56.23] where is Dua?
[66.17] She went to her mother’s house,
[68.53] where else would she go?
[71.73] Jaffar
[73.83] Yes Sir?
[75.33] Go bring Dua.
[80.20] Yes, Sir.
[83.97] Dua is not at her mother’s house.
[89.80] If she’s not at her mother’s house,
then where is she?
[99.83] In the lock-up.
[109.80] In the lock-up?
[112.47] Why?
[117.53] Because she tried to kill you.
[127.13] That’s why I had her arrested.
[129.53] You shouldn’t have done that.
[137.80] I shouldn’t have done that?
[142.47] Nosherwan,
[143.87] what was I supposed to do?
[146.00] Let you die like that?
[156.07] I saw with my own eyes
that she gave you poison.
[167.87] You regained consciousness
after two days.
[170.27] Look at your condition now,
[173.43] and you're telling me
I shouldn’t have done that?
[183.33] Jaffar.
[185.37] Sir?
[186.93] Go free her,
[192.93] go now.
[194.13] Jaffar will not go at any cost,
[196.13] I won’t let that happen at all.
[202.07] I won’t let you free her that easily.
[213.30] She…
[215.13] she tried to take your life,
how can she just walk out like that?
[222.20] Kashmala is absolutely right, dear.
[228.63] Let her stay in the lock-up.
[234.33] You could have lost your life.
[242.33] My life is already gone, Baba Saeein.
[290.17] All the formalities are complete.
[292.33] Please check them.
[293.43] You only have to sign these papers.
[299.53] Are you really withdrawing
the case yourselves?
[302.40] Yes.
[304.73] You people are something else,
[306.53] first, you have someone arrested,
[308.33] and then you withdraw the FIR.
[312.37] Sign these papers and
release our client.
[328.63] Mustafa,
[330.13] bring her.
[331.93] Thank you.
[333.07] You're welcome.
[366.13] Let’s go, please.
[399.40] Yes, Khadim Hussain,
bring the car out.
[402.37] I have to go somewhere.
[425.67] You go inside.
[429.60] Ghaznavi?
[431.13] He is alive,
[432.33] he has regained consciousness now.
[434.83] Thank God.
[437.37] This has happened on Sir’s orders.
[441.60] Only then was this possible.
[443.60] Just take care of yourself.
[512.60] Dua?
[514.47] come in!.
[524.13] Sister?
[529.73] My child,
[531.80] thank God that you have returned!
[535.40] Who arranged your bail?
[537.33] Ghaznavi did.
[539.23] He sent Jaffar,
[540.93] and he dropped me here.
[544.03] Thank God my daughter has returned home.
[546.87] Sania,
[548.00] go tell your father that Dua is back.
[553.13] I knew
[555.00] my daughter could never try
to take someone's life.
[559.07] Come, sit.
[575.73] Sit, dear, sit.
[579.03] You’re back again?
[581.77] How did you let her in?
[589.43] Keep quiet, Fizza.
[590.57] Why?
[591.67] Why should I keep quiet?
[601.00] A girl who gave her husband poison
and left him to die
[605.03] can’t be trusted at all.
[606.93] I can't trust her.
[615.47] She ruined her sister’s home,
[617.57] poisoned her husband,
[620.43] and now you’re letting her
enter this house.
[622.27] Do you think she’ll spare you all?
[631.40] She’s a heartless witch
who devours people.
[633.87] -What are you saying?
-No!
[641.67] There’s still time, Father,
throw her out now,
[647.60] or she’ll poison all of us and kill us.
[658.73] -Dear, listen to me.
-What do you all think?
[661.67] Ghaznavi got her
released out of love?
[670.40] I’m sure
[672.20] he did it out of pity.
[687.63] If he had love in his heart for her
[690.53] or thought she was innocent,
he would have called her to himself,
[700.07] not had her released by a servant.
[702.57] I can’t trust her.
[709.43] What are you saying?
[710.67] Your sister has only been here
for two minutes!
[717.47] Dua…
[719.83] Let her at least breathe,
[721.57] you’re speaking whatever is coming
to your mind. You keep talking and talking...
[741.57] Nosherwan Saeein,
[744.67] have your soup and
then take your medicine.
[748.37] Jaffar hasn’t returned yet?
[762.17] Oh, here he is…
[764.73] Jaffar, where is Dua?
[767.57] Sir, I picked her up from the police station
and dropped her off at her mother’s house.
[772.83] Dua didn’t come to meet me?
[782.20] Why would she come now?
[786.93] The one who tried to take your life,
[790.23] you pardoned her life,
[801.13] and now you’ve set her free.
[803.73] What’s her business here?
[805.07] No Amma Saeein,
[808.43] my heart isn’t ready to believe it.
[817.23] Dua wouldn’t do this.
[824.17] She already did it.
[830.13] That’s why we were against her.
[842.47] We didn’t want you to marry
such a low-class girl.
[845.97] Whatever you say...
[848.77] I won’t believe it.
[860.23] Dua couldn’t poison me.
[864.93] If Dua didn’t poison you,
then who did? Tell me.
[868.63] He is right,
[874.33] Dua didn’t try to take his life.
[883.93] Neither did she poison his food.
[894.07] If Dua didn’t give the poison,
[899.03] then how did his life end up in danger?
[908.13] Actually, Baba Saeein,
[911.33] that food was made for me by Dua.
[920.00] Specifically for me.
[927.57] She wanted to take my life.
[930.23] It...
[932.40] It was a mistake that I placed that food
in front of Nosherwan.
[946.40] If I had even the slightest idea that
the food was poisoned,
[951.33] I would have eaten it myself and died
rather than let anything happen to my Saeein.
[968.60] That way,
[970.93] even Dua would have had her revenge.
[973.80] She doesn’t like it,
[976.20] she doesn’t like it at all that
I am married to Saeein.
[997.13] That’s why she wanted to take my life.
[1008.67] A life is a life,
[1010.63] whether it's yours or Nosherwan’s.
[1023.33] That low-class girl, I had always
expected this from her.
[1029.77] No, Baba Saeein,
she couldn’t do such a thing.
[1031.87] Why don’t you all understand?
[1046.93] Dua can’t take anyone’s life.
[1051.23] She is not like that.
[1123.37] Madam.
[1125.83] Please go from here.
[1127.53] Jaffar, just once,
[1130.80] just let me meet him once.
[1133.33] I’ll take one look and leave right away.
[1137.03] Jaffar, this is my special order.
[1139.83] Now that girl shouldn’t even be
seen near Nosherwan.
[1143.97] Baba Saeein’s special order is that
you are not allowed to meet Sir.
[1157.17] Please, I beg you,
[1162.97] just let me meet him once.
[1165.57] From afar, I’ll only take one look and
won’t say anything to anyone. I’ll leave.
[1171.13] Madam, why are you making me
out to be a sinner?
[1178.83] You are my Madam,
you are Sir’s wife.
[1182.37] You are deserving of respect from me.
[1187.20] But Madam,
[1190.07] I can’t let you meet Sir.
[1192.97] Just,
[1194.33] just one look.
[1195.77] I will fall at your feet
if you say so. But,
[1197.87] Oh!
[1199.03] Madam!
[1200.67] What are you doing?
[1202.17] I…I…
[1203.47] I won’t say anything to anyone.
I’ll quietly leave.
[1220.93] For Ghaznavi’s sake.
[1227.73] Please just one look.
[1231.33] Okay, Madam,
[1233.40] just one glance.
[1241.57] Go…
[1327.43] Why have you come here?
[1330.33] I’ve come to see Ghaznavi.
[1332.37] You have come to see him?
[1334.53] You try to kill him, you poison him,
[1337.80] and now you come to visit him?
[1343.97] What kind of drama is this?
Hunh?
[1348.20] If Baba Saeein and
Amma Saeein see you,
[1350.80] it’ll be a big problem for you.
[1356.33] You intended to cause difficulties for me.
[1359.17] Yes, I did,
[1361.43] but I had to back off because of
Saeein here as well.
[1373.80] Otherwise, you would have spent
your whole life behind bars.
[1385.13] Before I do something
worse with you, leave now.
[1391.13] I just want to see Ghaznavi
for a little while.
[1394.47] Haven’t you seen him already?
[1396.53] Yes?
[1397.40] You’ve seen him to your heart’s content.
[1404.67] Now, go away.
Leave.
[1412.87] What are you doing here?
[1421.77] We spared your life
in exchange for our son.
[1434.47] Consider that your fortune.
[1436.67] Now go away
[1441.07] and never come back into
my son’s life again.
[1449.00] Baba Saeein,
[1451.03] Baba Saeein, I didn’t do anything.
[1456.73] I didn’t do anything,
[1458.23] I just wanted to see Ghaznavi once, please.
[1461.23] Go away from here.
[1563.37] Why are you sitting here?
[1565.83] Come on, he needs to rest.
Let’s go!
[1567.83] We won’t bother Uncle at all, Mother.
[1570.57] Yes Mother, we won’t disturb him at all.
Promise!
[1574.83] Come on, don’t be stubborn.
[1576.00] Arham, Mizna, come on, let’s go.
[1577.53] Come on, good job.
[1580.17] Okay, come on, kids, you may leave.
[1582.20] You can come back later.
[1584.20] -Okay, Uncle.
-Okay, Uncle.
[1586.33] Let’s go.
[1587.37] I’ll serve something for you to eat.
[1589.13] Please, get my clothes ready.
[1591.73] Yes.
[1593.73] Jaffar.
[1597.93] Yes?
[1599.73] Get my clothes, I’d like to change.
[1603.40] Yes, Sir.
[1604.33] And...
[1607.20] where are Dua’s clothes and belongings?
I didn’t see them.
[1610.13] She has taken everything.
[1616.23] When you were unconscious,
[1618.73] she packed everything and left.
[1624.87] She must have thought
you were going to die,
[1630.77] so she gathered her things
and left before that.
[1639.20] Now, she’ll be waiting for
news of your death
[1642.33] so that she can finish her mourning period
and marry Sarfaraz.
[1654.07] I’ll take your leave, Sir.
[1655.13] No, no, don’t go.
[1656.97] I’ll leave. I’ll go myself.
[1659.40] You stay.
[1666.87] Sir, I’ll bring your clothes.
[1728.13] What are you doing here?
[1737.13] I’ll stay here with you until
your health improves.
[1747.67] My health is fine now.
[1750.60] I don’t need anyone. You can go.
[1756.60] You may need me,
[1761.77] you’ve not fully recovered yet.
[1769.93] I’ll stay with you tonight.
[1779.00] I’ve already told you that
I don’t need anything.
[1781.63] You can leave,
and I don’t like repeating myself.
[1793.23] -Nosherwan…
-Go away.
[1829.13] How do I convince you?
[1831.57] I have given you so many clarifications,
[1835.00] I have told you so many times but….
[1837.93] Sarfaraz was lying.
[1840.07] He wasn’t telling the truth.
[1844.77] He wants to poison your heart against me
so much that you’ll leave me.
[1850.97] That’s how he’ll get his revenge.
[1874.73] But she could’ve called me.
[1877.83] Doesn’t she know I need her?
[1906.97] We spared your life
in exchange for our son.
[1911.53] Consider that your fortune.
[1913.60] Now go away
[1916.73] and never come back into
my son’s life again.
[1959.93] Hello, Ghaznavi, how are you?
[1968.53] Do you know I came to see you?
[1979.83] But no one let me meet you.
[1989.83] Everyone thinks I tried to
poison you and kill you.
[2003.03] That’s not true.
[2006.47] I swear, I didn’t put poison in the food.
[2016.23] How could I take your life?
I love you so much.
[2024.80] I…
[2027.93] I…
[2029.37] I could even give up my life for you.
[2041.53] Ghaznavi,
[2051.23] Ghaznavi?
[2103.67] Ghaznavi thinks
[2107.93] that I poisoned him.
[2112.20] That I tried to take his life.
[2115.57] You know me very well.
[2118.23] I love him so much,
I can’t even think….
[2122.00] If Ghaznavi trusted you,
[2125.53] you wouldn’t have been
taken by the police.
[2128.53] And after regaining consciousness,
[2130.60] Ghaznavi wouldn’t have been
careless about you.
[2142.27] The truth is, Dua,
[2144.93] Ghaznavi has recognized
your deceitful face.
[2155.03] How many more lives will you ruin?
[2159.00] You’ve destroyed my home, Dua.
[2169.23] You have made my child’s identity disappear
before it even entered this world.
[2179.00] And now you’re saying
[2181.73] that we shouldn’t hold you responsible
for the incident that happened with Ghaznavi?
[2193.13] Dua, you must have done something
[2196.93] that makes no one even want
to see your face.
[2201.07] I made a huge mistake
[2204.97] by leaving the back door open for Sarfaraz.
[2211.07] That’s why my sister has set up a court
[2216.57] and held a trial treating me
like a criminal today.
[2223.87] You made me say all these things.
[2227.13] You’ve brought me to this point Dua.
[2233.57] What didn’t I do for you?
[2236.67] I used to love you a lot.
[2238.93] And I still love you, Fizza.
[2247.03] I didn’t know that my past mistakes
would enter my present
[2251.33] and destroy my future like this.
[2254.83] I had no idea…
[2263.60] Be quiet now,
she is already very disturbed.
[2266.77] Child, quiet now.
[2269.53] It’s not right to be this troubled
in such a state.
[2273.13] Keep yourself together.
