Sarfaraz, what is the matter that I cannot understand you? I have tolerated it today, but if your father talks 
like this in the future, then he will see the worst in me, and then I will deal 
with him in my manner. Greetings. Greetings. Why are you awake so soon? You should have rested. I am used to waking up 
for prayers in the morning and then university too… Hmm. If you want, then you can continue your studies. I will have no objections. Education? Hmm, if you want you can study further. Sure, I will think about it. Sure, think about it. Come on, we will have breakfast, 
and after that, I will show you your home. My home? This home is yours now. You have to take care of it. What is the matter, Saeein? You are worried. Yes. You think of the solution for 
a worry before it comes. I think about it, but… But what is 
the matter this time? I am worried because of
 the attack on Nosherwan yesterday. We shouldn’t take 
this attack normally. No matter how upset
 I am with him, he got married against our will. He got married Saeein, he didn’t sin. Hmm. Hmm. Did you find out? Did you find out who
 got the attack made? Yes, I have sent the men. We have so many enemies, they are investigating who dared to do this. Also keep the new enemies in mind,
 along with the old enemies. The enemies of our son
 are increasing day by day. Yes, you are right. I have sent the men, the enemy won't be 
able to hide for long. They should not be able to either. I had spoken to Nosherwan. Thank God, he and the daughter-in-law,
 both are fine. Thank God. After Zawar, I don’t have the courage
 to lose Nosherwan. You are right. But why would the 
enemy care about this? Saeein, I was thinking that you increase the security for Nosherwan. Send some more men 
of ours from here. You never know about the enemy, what if they attack again, then? Hmmm. I too was thinking 
about the same thing. Don’t think about it. Just do it. I will. I will. God has been really kind that both their lives got saved. I have done charity. Also, give goats. Yes Baba Saaein, Amma Saeein,
 I don’t feel too good. I will go to the room. Hey, child, have a proper breakfast. I have had it. Let her go Saeein. It is possible she is feeling suffocated
 by what we are saying. But Kashmala, don’t go to the room, go out in the open air, and you will feel good. Sure, Amma Saaein. Thank God you are fine. When Sania told me you were unwell all night long, I had gotten really worried. Now that I have seen you, I am at peace or else I would 
have remained worried. I will go now. Hey, child, if you have come, 
then stay for a while. No, mama, I will go now. What’s this coming and going 
for just two minutes, Fiza? In an instant, you have started
 feeling like a stranger. I didn’t inform them before coming, and if I get late, then everyone at 
home will get worried. That’s why. You did good that you came over. I was worried because of the behavior 
of Sister Kausar and Sarfaraz yesterday. Child, are they treating you well? Yes, yes, everything is fine. I also came thinking that you would be worried after yesterday. Child, you started the job by your will, right? Yes, mama. I don’t know why my heart doesn’t believe your truth. Why are you worrying yourself, and also worrying me too. I am telling you, everything is fine with me over there. Okay. I believe you if you say it. Greetings, papa. You? You have come again? Mr. Aslam. You be quiet. Mr. Aslam. Mr. Aslam. Haven't you had enough? Huh? You came with your husband and
 mother-in-law, yesterday and now you're back the next 
day to humiliate us even more? I just came to meet you. Why did you come to meet us? What is the need? Are you not content? I married you off, still, you come over. There is no need. 
We are dead for you. Forget our home. And one more thing, If your in-laws, or that
 loudmouth husband of yours, come near this house again, I'll break your husband's legs and I'll kill you. I will go, mama. I am getting late. So, how do you like the home? Really good. But do you live alone
 in such a big home? I used to live alone, but now, you are with me. Hmmm I mean, your Mama, Papa, Brothers and Sisters? My brother got murdered
 some time back. Murder? How? I will share everything with you. Earlier, I had no one who I would say all this to. Now I will share my sorrow, happiness,
and everything with you. But, do you people have any enmity? Come. Sit. Even that attack last night… When you have 
money and power, then these enemies
 are made automatically. You don’t need to make 
them separately. We and our mansion have always supported the poor. That is why, Baba Saeein’s enemies had an 
issue with his good reputation. I will take you to 
the mansion someday. When you see everything, you will understand. What are you thinking? Nothing. Why didn’t Baba and Amma 
Saeein not come to our wedding? Had I asked them,
 they would have surely come. Any special reason for hiding it? No, there was no special reason. Maybe I am not 
a good girl in their eyes, and that’s why you didn’t find
 it necessary to inform them. That is not true, at all. Indeed, I didn’t seek their 
permission for this wedding. But I had informed both of them when I came to marry you. In fact, when you were unconscious, Amma Saeein called and she was asking
 about your well-being. Had those people said
 no to this wedding, then would you 
refuse to marry me? Only my heart’s permission
 was enough for me to marry you. I am scared. What if in the future, you get over me, or if you leave me
 under someone’s pressure, then I will go back to Zunaira… I would want that you don’t take
 Zunaira’s name in the future. Forget your past considering
 it a bad dream. Your companionship is 
a beautiful dream for me. Waking up, I made myself believe 
that this is not a dream, it is reality. I should forget my past. But still, I have this fear. Why? Don’t you trust me? I do. I trust you a lot. But I fear my fate. Happiness just doesn’t suit me. Get rid of all these fears 
and anxieties from your mind, because now your fate is tied to the fate of 
Nosherwan Ghaznavi. I am putting this home in your name. What is the need for this? There surely is. In the future, at least you 
will not have the fear that if I leave you,
 then where will you go? Meaning you plan on leaving me? Never. I have held this 
hand for all my life. I will never leave you. Have faith in me,
 as well as my love. Madam, have food. I don’t want to eat, take it away. Who are you punishing by
 keeping yourself hungry? You will fall ill this way. So, let me get unwell. I want to die. Since when did my madam 
become so weak that she is talking about death? May your enemies die. I had tried that, but she survived. She had good luck, that’s why she survived. And what about my luck? Huh? It's like snakes are 
writhing on my chest, right? If you give up so quickly, how will it work? I even advised you 
to get a hold on sir, but did you ever listen to me? It takes time and effort to seize 
control of a foreign territory... I tried. Before I could establish
 my hold there, someone else came and 
made a place there. She will leave as quickly,
 as she came. How can you say this? I have heard she has not
 come from a good place, sir will get over her really soon. And in the meantime, should I just keep
 burning with anger, huh? Why will you burn? She will burn. What burning are 
you talking about? She is sitting comfortably, 
having taken over your sir’s heart. She has seized control
 of his home and property, and here I am, burning with anger. Instead of burning yourself, why don’t you make
 arrangements for them to burn? How do I do it? Tell me. Baba Saeein and 
Amma Saeein even accepted his marriage. How do I do it? Even if they have accepted it, but your importance
 is in its place. You have been the eldest 
daughter-in-law of this mansion. You have a double status, and you need to assert this
 status over that newcomer. Remind her of her 
place and her worth. Instead of crying and sobbing, you need to make her cry. Show her that you can put her back in her 
place whenever you want. Do you understand what I am trying to explain to you? Where is your daughter-in-law? I had asked her for tea. She is a really lazy girl. Fiza. Where are you? Are you making tea or curry? Yes, I am coming. I am coming. Here you go. Should I get something
 more for you? Hey, what is this? You only brought
 a single cup of tea, that too for your husband. Did you forget your mother-in-law? You didn’t ask me, so… Okay, so I will only get tea 
when I ask for it. No, I will just make it and bring it. Just leave it. If I have to ask you 
to take care of me, then what is the point of it? I will make it myself. Where is your focus? Do you have any sense in you? You spoiled Mama’s 
mood for no reason. No, actually, she had it a little while back, so I thought… What? What? Now you will also keep a check 
on how much I eat and drink. Wow, just wow. You are amazing. I will just bring it in two minutes. I told you, now I don’t feel like having it. Tell me something. Today, you came late
 from school again. Huh? Err… She must have gone to 
her parents’ home. This is the benefit of the school being close
 to the parent’s home. Here, she uses the traffic as an excuse and there she sits at 
her parents' home and talks to her mother
 and sister for hours. No, no, not for hours. I just sat with Mama for a little while. See. See. Her theft has been caught. Did we give you permission
 to go out of the home, so that you do what you want? Is this why you go 
out of the home daily? No, I don’t go daily. Today, Sania told me that Mama is not well, so that is why, I went for a little while. Did you not get satisfied getting 
us humiliated by your father, that you went there again? Mama, the truth is
 all this is your fault. She got permission to
 go because of you. Now suffer the consequences. I told… Hey, how was I to know she will step out and do
 what she wants? Hmmm. By the way, how can she not do it? Obviously, she too has 
the same blood as Dua. Understand one thing well, because I decide to 
make you understand, then it will not be good for you. You have driven me mad. Madam, sir is on the phone for you. Hello. What were you doing? I was waiting for 
you to come back. If you love me so much, I will leave everything and just sit with you. Okay, listen, 
I sent something for you. I hope you will like it. If you have sent it, it must be good. Goodbye. Madam, sir has sent some things for you and he has said that you will wear this over dinner today. Keep it. Hello. Yes, I will let you talk to her. Madam, there is a call for you. For me? Yes, for you. Fine, you can leave. Hello. How are you, love? Rumi. Yes, Rumi. The same Rumi you forgot as 
soon as you left from here. That is not true. When did I forget you? You didn’t think of me either. Or should I say that the hero didn’t let you 
remember anything? It is not like that. You are not someone 
who can be forgotten. Yes, that is true. Okay, tell me, are you happy? What do you feel? The happiness in your
 tone makes it evident that you are really happy. Ghaznavi is really good. There is no doubt about that. I just pray that you
 always rule his heart. Amen. I have called you for the last 
time to feel this happiness. Last time? What do you mean, last time? You can always call me, Rumi. As soon I get a phone, you will be the first one 
I send the number to. You can call me
 whenever you want. No, my love, don’t do that. I just want that 
we don’t stay in touch. We don’t stay in touch? But why? You coming here 
was an accident, and along with prayers, I was trying hard to get you out 
of here, as soon as possible. See, how my prayer got
 answered within moments, and you left from here forever,
 as Mrs. Nosherwan. You are right. But Rumi, what is the harm in our friendship? You have become the 
daughter-in-law of a really good family. You are the wife of 
a man like Nosherwan. God knows how many girls long 
to see just one glimpse of him. I don’t want the reference of a woman like 
Zunaira to stay with you because of me. You too forget coming 
here as a bad dream. Yes, I will always pray for you. You are doing a big injustice, Rumi. There is no injustice. You will be really happy and you will see, 
you won’t even remember that you were ever friends 
with someone like Rumi. I never forget good friends. I want you to come to meet me. Hey, you people still 
haven’t started eating. I had brought hot and fresh
 kebabs with the rice. Child, it is enough. Keep this and you too sit down. Yes. Yes. I am also coming. The yoghurt is left, I will bring it. I will bring the yoghurt. Huh, okay. Why do you portray that only 
you do all the work at home? The maid comes
 in the morning to clean up and Sumbul is with you to help you
 when you are cooking in the kitchen, right? Yes. Sumbul helps me a lot. Hey, how long has 
she been married for, that you are putting the burden of
 home management on the daughter-in-law? So, it is good that she is taking care of the home. Why should we count Sumbul? She is here today, she will go to her in-laws’
 home in the future, then who will take care of the home? She will, right? It is good she is getting
 used to working. But, till the time Sumbul is at home, let her do some work as well. She will learn some
 home management. Papa, sister-in-law doesn’t
 let me do anything. Child, it is a good thing that your sister-in-law takes 
so much care of you. Now, when she cares for you, then you too should take care of her. Absolutely. I will take a lot of care
 of my sister-in-law. That’s good. Okay. Okay, fine. Have food. Child, pass the rice. Hey, you have not 
taken anything till now. And, Mr. Sarfaraz, don’t you have to take 
Fiza for an outing? Outing? Yes. Papa, my condition 
is in front of you. When do I have money? And I have told you, I have applied for a job 
at a lot of places. Things will move forward
 when I hear from someone. And, after all, it won’t seem nice that I have taken money from you,
 for even the outing. Great. Since when did you 
start thinking like this? My son’s thinking has changed. He has become sensible now. But this overnight change? When is it overnight? He is married now, and then what will
 he say to his wife? I am taking you for an outing 
with money from Papa. I pray to God that he gets a job, then he will look good taking
 care of all these things. Listen, instead of making him understand, you are encouraging him? Papa, mama is right, you know. My conscience doesn’t allow it. I have told you, that once I get a job, then we will think about the outing. Okay fine. If you want to say that you will take her later, then alright. First class. But right now, do one thing, take Fiza shopping tomorrow. Shopping? Why should he take her shopping? I just got so many things made
 in the wedding dresses, and I had sent such 
good wedding gifts, I sent such pretty dresses and she too had brought along
 a few dresses with herself. What is the need 
for shopping right now? Mama, there is no 
need for shopping, you need to be in 
the mood for shopping. After all, the weather is changing. Sister-in-law will buy clothes for 
herself as per the changing weather. Hey, you stay quiet. Sumbul is absolutely right. The weather is changing, so what if she too makes 
two new dresses? And mister, if you want to make 
the same excuse here, that you will go buy clothes
 with your father’s money, then think that I too am taking care of your 
and Sumbul’s expenses, so even if I spend 
a little more for Fiza, then what is the harm in that? After all, my Fiza is just like Sumbul. What are you thinking? Nothing special. I will not be able to tolerate you thinking
 about anyone else, with me there. Really? You look really beautiful. So beautiful that 
I want this moment to stop here, and I continue
 to see you like this. You are weird. What do you mean? Meaning, weird. At times I don’t understand if I should respect you 
more or love you more. Whatever you want. I promise, neither of them
 will ever get reduced. This is for you. This… Open it. How do you like it? Really beautiful. It will look even more 
beautiful when you wear it. I didn’t give you anything
 as your wedding gift. This is your wedding gift. You have given me so much, I don’t want anything else. I have no longing for anything else. I am with you for all my life.
