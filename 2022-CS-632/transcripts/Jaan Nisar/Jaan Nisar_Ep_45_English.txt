Have tea. Fiza, are you happy? Yes, I am happy. When will you make
me meet your husband? You want to meet Sarfaraz? Yes, he is my brother-in-law. You must have told him that I have returned, right? I don’t know how to tell him but the reality can't be hidden for long. What can I do? Tell me, what’s the matter? Sarafraz, he doesn't like your mention at all. Does he know that I am your sister? Yes, on our wedding day,
the matter was kept hidden, and everything was fine. But the next day, the secret came out, and ever since then, his mood hasn't improved. He gets irritated by your name. Why? I haven't even met him so what problem does he have with me? In his eyes, girls who run away from
home cannot be forgiven, and you, Dua, have committed this crime. I haven't even told him about your return because I'm afraid that if he finds out, he might force me to
cut ties with this house. From now on Fiza, not you but Sarfaraz will be scared. Why are you standing
outside of this house? Our madam comes here. Why does your madam come here? This is our madam’s home. You? Yes, it’s me. Why? Can't you believe it? How will you believe? How could you, after leaving me to suffer
as if I were doomed to burn in hell? I recently learned that you're my brother-in-law, and honestly, I didn’t like it at all. How can the husband of my beloved
sister be such a characterless person? To be honest, I wanted to forget everything you did to me. I hoped to leave it all to God and move on. But not anymore. My resolve is weakening now that I know you are Fiza’s husband. I might have forgiven you for
the sake of my sister before, but that’s no longer possible. I will hold you accountable for
the pain my sister endured. You’ve tainted my honor and disrespected Fiza under
the guise of being her husband. Her crime is indeed very big
since she married a man like you. You have played enough
with the respect of everyone. Now, your game is over. Now, I will tell you what it feels like to get
your respect tarnished. Now, you will face
the same pain I endured or the pain you caused Fiza. Now, I dare you to bring a tear to Fiza’s eyes. If I don’t turn you to dust then tell me. Yesterday, you sought to make
the helpless Dua the center of attention. Today, you face a different Dua, someone you cannot harm or escape from. Now, just wait and watch what I will do to you. Maybe you are upset because
it took me time to come out. Actually, I couldn’t find my robe, which is why, I got late. Why did I go quiet in front of her? Why wasn’t I able to say anything to her? Who is she to threaten me? Where did she get all this wealth from? I left her in a place where
she couldn't escape from then how did she manage
to get all this wealth? If I tell everyone the truth then
she won't be able to face the world but how will I tell everyone 
that I was that person? Such a luxurious car 
came to drop your family off, what's going on? You have such rich relatives and I don’t know about them, hmm? They are our distant relatives, from my father’s side. They come seldomly. No, no, the matter is definitely something else. This is the truth. Today, you face a different Dua, someone you cannot harm or escape from. Now, just wait and watch what I will do to you. What is the issue with you? Is the issue with me or your brother? What did Brother do this time? He didn't even talk to you. Your brother has an attitude problem. Why is he so arrogant? You are harboring resentment
towards Brother for no reason. He is jealous of me. I agree that my brother is short-tempered but that does not mean that you keep on badmouthing Brother
and praising Sister-in-law. I only speak the truth. You shouldn’t speak enough truth
that cannot be digested. Sister-in-law Fiza is very nice. Even a blind person can tell that. What do you know about
Sister-in-law and her background? What don't I know? Enlighten me. Sister-in-law and her sister, they don’t belong to an honourable family. Our patience and Brother’s nobility have allowed him to remain married to her. And then, there is you, who keeps taunting me about how
my brother is this way or that way. So you proved that you are indeed the sister of your brother. You are the same blood. Yes, I am. We are the same blood. At least we are not two-faced. Unlike Sister-in-law, our news doesn’t get
broadcast on TV or appear in the newspaper. Do you know what Sumbul, I think we should not
talk for a few days. Yes, even I believe that
we shouldn't talk for a few days. Sumbul, please check the salt in this. Please check it yourself. Hey, what happened? Is your mood off? Did you argue with Khizar? Yes, we argued. You are the reason for our argument. Me? How did I become the reason? You are very clever. You are very clever. You present Brother as
a tyrant in front of the world and everyone believes
that Brother oppresses you. I have never complained
about Sarfaraz to anyone. You might not have complained but you make an innocent face that you garner everyone’s sympathy. You have a misunderstanding
regarding me Sumbul. No. The blindfold of misunderstanding
has been removed from my eyes. You are not as good as
I considered you to be. When Khizar compares me to you, then I realize that Mother and Brother are absolutely right. Girls like you can never
see someone get settled. What are you talking about Sumbul? Just do me a favour. Stay away from Khizar. Please. Are you saying this Sumbul? Yes, first Brother used to say this
and now I am saying it. If my relationship gets ruined because of you then it won’t be good for you. Remember that. With the ominous face you
roam around in front of me, it turns into a smiling face as soon as
a stranger man comes in front of you. People believe that
I oppress you but, in reality, women like you stay happy
with a stranger man. You are doing wrong. Khizar is like my brother. That’s enough! He is like my brother. Jaffar, do you see this guy? Go after him and find out where he works. Where does he go? I want all the details of him. Sure. Listen, don’t mention all this to Ghaznavi. He is my brother-in-law so I don't want him to find out
anything regarding this matter. You don’t worry at all. It will be like that. Madam, that guy is Sarfaraz. He works in sir’s office. In Ghaznavi’s office? Does that mean he has met Ghaznavi? Yes, he is very ill-mannered. Sir even wanted to kick him out of the office. Okay. What’s this?
Why are you picking up your veil? Mom, I’m just leaving. I’m about to head out. Leaving like this? Have something to eat. No, Mom, you know I’ll be late.
I’m leaving now. There’s no rush. Have a little food. I’ll feed my daughter with my own hands. Sit down here. Okay, then call Saniya too. She’ll come. She’s making fritters. These were ready so I brought them, since you’re in a hurry. What happened, Fiza? Fiza. Fiza. Fiza, Fiza my child, what’s... Fiza , its ok? What happened? Are you feeling unwell? Come, let’s go to the doctor. No, Mom, I just want to go home.
I need to go home. You can go home from there too. Let’s go to the doctor. Put on your veil, I’ll get mine. Let’s go. Many Congratulations, you’re going to be a grandmother. But since she’s had a miscarriage before, we’ll need to be very careful this time. She’ll need to follow a proper diet, and I’m recommending some iron
and calcium medicine that she’ll need to take regularly. Yes, of course. You can get all these medicines
from our pharmacy. Here you go. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Goodbye. You? Yes, me. What are you doing here? Came to see you. Why are you standing? Sit down. Shut up and get out of here. I have a reputation at this place. Don’t say anything ridiculous here. Reputation? The other day you threatened
me to tell everyone everything. Go ahead and tell them, or should I do it? Keep your mouth shut,
do you understand? I’ll make sure you and
your sister are so disgraced you won’t be able to show
your faces anywhere. You’re still threatening me? Amazing. I’m not threatening you. I’m just telling you what
I’m going to do to you. And that rich man you married, by trapping and deceiving him, I’ll tell him everything. You won’t have anywhere to go. Not all men are like you, with a dirty mind like yours. Hmm. Oh, it seems you haven’t forgotten
what happened to you. I haven’t forgotten anything, and I won’t let you forget either. Fine, then let’s go. If I want, I can expose
the truth to everyone. Go ahead, reveal the truth to everyone. I’d like to see how brave you really are. And the thing you’re
trying to scare me with, Ghaznavi already knows everything. But think about what will happen to you
if I tell him that person is you. What will he do to you? Ghaznavi? You’re standing in front of
Mrs. Nosherwan Ghaznavi. What? You were coming to the office?
Why didn’t you tell me? Surprise. Oh. What brings you here? Came to see Sarfaraz. I don’t understand. He’s my brother-in-law, Fiza’s husband. Fiza’s husband? I just found out yesterday
that he works here, so I thought if I am coming,
I’d meet him. He doesn’t like meeting us, you know. Let’s go to my room. Not to the room. I didn’t come here to sit,
I came to have lunch. Let’s go for lunch then. Let’s go. Phone. Here you go. The blood report will come tomorrow. You heard what the doctor said, right? You have to take care of your diet and take your medicine on time. Yes, it’s getting late. I’ll leave for home now. Yes, let’s go after getting the medicine. Actually, I’ll personally drop you home, and I’ll tell Sister Kausar that you won’t be working
at the school anymore. No, Mom, she won’t like that. My child, you’ve already suffered once. You need to take care of yourself. I’ll take care of myself, I’ll try to talk to her when
I get the chance to quit the job. If you say something,
she might not like it. Just drop me home from outside. -Alright,
-Take medicine as you wish. Give me that, son. I’ll tell Sarfaraz first, then he’ll inform everyone at home. He’ll be very happy with this news. Yes. Maybe, just maybe, this news will
change his attitude towards me. Maybe this news will make him love me. When will he come? Look, I know I’ve caused you a lot of pain, and I deeply regret it. Your regret won’t fill my empty arms. My child left this world before
I could even hold him. Fiza, but don’t worry, I’m here with you. God will bless us with more children, and I promise you this time I’ll take very good care of you. Greetings. I’ve laid out your clothes. Listen, there’s something
I want to tell you. I wanted to say something to you. Can’t you understand that
I don’t want to talk to you? Did I make a mistake? No, you didn’t make a mistake. The mistake was mine for marrying you, and for that, I beg your forgiveness. Here, take it. Why are you doing this? What are you saying? I just wanted to tell you that... Fiza, stop bothering me, please stop bothering me. You are his wife. If you don’t know, then who does? Does your husband love you or not? Sarfaraz’s anger takes over everything. I can’t figure out if he loves me or not. Parents can only judge the decency of a boy’s
family before getting their daughters married. A mother cannot see if her daughter will receive love
from that family or not. By the way, I was really surprised. About what? To find out that Sarfaraz is Fiza’s husband. Hmm, I was surprised too. I mean, I didn’t expect Sarfaraz for Fiza. Exactly, he doesn’t suit Fiza at all. I mean, he’s a very different guy,
who says strange things. I also found him strange
after hearing his words. What did your father and
mother see in him? Respectability. That’s what middle-class parents look for. But there’s nothing else there. Wasn’t it Sarfaraz who
said he objected to meeting you? Where did that objection go? He’s still my employee. I thought after learning the truth,
he’d quit this job, but that didn’t happen. We’ll see. What happened? Did he say something? Did he misbehave? No, no, what would he say to me? He was speechless
when he saw me as your wife. I didn’t like him much either. You should keep your distance from him. It’s fine to meet him as Fiza’s husband but within limits. That’s why I’m saying if
he says something to you tomorrow, I won’t tolerate it. Then I’ll deal with him in my own way. So, you should be careful. Yes.
