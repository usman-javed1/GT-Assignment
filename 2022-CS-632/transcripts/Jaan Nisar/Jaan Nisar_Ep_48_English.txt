Why are you repeatedly calling
when Jaffar told you I am busy? Are you so busy that you don’t even have
two minutes to talk to me? Yes, that’s how it is. You are hurting me. You have hurt me as well. I? When did I hurt you? Tell me, what do you want? I wanted to ask you, when are you coming back? My flight for today has been canceled. I will stay here for two to three days
and then come back. Two to three days? But why? You had your meetings
lined up till today, right? Yes, some extra work has come up. Okay. I miss you a lot. I thought I would go home with you. I can’t come today. Okay. But get done with your work soon. I will hang up now,
I will talk to you later. Okay, listen, I love you. Won’t you reply? Madam used to love Sarfaraz. Yes, my child, are you done talking? Yes. So, then you call him here. Have dinner here and
then you guys can leave. No, Mom, he is not coming today, he will return in two to three days. Why? How come all of a sudden? Is everything okay? Yes, everything is fine. He said there’s some work, an emergency. that’s why. Okay, fine, he must finish his work. Mom, I wanted to go home. Why, my child?
Is there a problem here? No, no, there is no problem. So, my child,
what will you do alone at home? You can go with Ghaznavi
when he comes back. Umm, I had to get a few things so I thought of going there
and bringing them myself. Okay, fine. How will you go? Shall I ask your dad to take you? You can also come back with him. Hey, no, no, there is no need to bother Dad. I will call the driver so he will take me and
bring me back as well. Okay, whatever is feasible to you. Come. Sir, you must eat. No, Jaffar, I am not hungry. Sir, you will get unwell like this. No, I am not so weak. You don’t worry about me. Don’t say something
which is not in my control, sir. There must be some solution to it, sir. I am unable to find
a solution to this problem. Sir, why are you quiet? You must talk to Madam, ask her. I don’t want to ask her anything. If she tells everything herself,
well and good. I won’t ask her anything. But Sir that would be your loss. Jaffar, after knowing that killing truth, what else can I lose? Whenever I asked
Dua about that man or thought about bringing an end to him, Dua always eluded
the matter by saying that she didn’t want to talk
anything about her past and when the past has walked
right in front of her today, she is misleading me
without any shame. It clearly shows she was trying
to save Sarfaraz since forever, she was lying to me. No, Sir, madam might be helpless. Sarfaraz turned out to be her brother-in-law, she might be hiding the truth from
everyone because of this. There is a huge difference between me
and everyone, Jaffar. How can she lie to me? Doesn’t she trust me? I can find out the reason why madam
hid the truth from you if you say so. You won’t ask anything from her, let her hide everything if she wants to. Don’t let her know that we know the truth. Let her hide it. Whatever you say. You may go now. It doesn’t matter to me who was in your
life before me or who wasn’t, you shouldn’t have a place for anyone
in your life except me from today onwards, hmm? Trust me as much as you trust yourself, I will never embarrass you. You cannot be disloyal. But if this is not disloyalty then what is it? Greetings, Sister-in-law, how are you? Greetings, I didn’t realize when you came. I just came a while ago, Sister-in-law. You must be here to meet Sumbul, please sit down, I will call her. Sister-in-law, like Brother Sarfaraz, do you also
not like that I come here? There is nothing like that. There is something, Sister-in-law, you start panicking when I come here and then you go elsewhere. Has Brother Sarfaraz asked you to do so? What are you doing here? I came here for some work when I saw Khizer sitting over here… So? Are you done seeing him? You may go now. What is this tone that you are
talking to Sister-in-law in? I am using the tone she will understand. Behave yourself, Sumbul, she is your sister-in-law. Both of you need to take
this reality seriously. What are you trying to say? That she is my sister-in-law, I know how to deal with her. I guess you are forgetting that we are together because
of your sister-in-law and we got married because of her. So, should I give her an award for it like you keep on giving her
by praising her all the time? There is not a single day when I don’t listen to a lecture on
the qualities of my sister-in-law. You look like a literal picture
of your brother right now, you are talking the same way. I will be like him, I will be the literal picture of my brother. When you make Sister-in-law
stand in front of me, I won’t stay quiet as well. Enough! I cannot tolerate this pathetic mentality
of yours anymore now. Contact me when you change your mentality. My mentality won’t change. Thank you for letting me know. I should reconsider my decision. The girl who has changed
so much after the wedding, how much more will she and
her behavior change after the marriage? What? What do you mean? You will find out whatever I mean. Answer, no, answer me before you leave. Khizer, answer me before you leave. Will you break up with me? Answer me before you leave, Khizer. Will you break up with me over this issue? Khizer? Where are you going? I am going to Mom’s place to meet Dua. What do you want? What happened, Sumbul? What do you want? Do you want me to get divorced? Do you want Khizer to leave me? Why would I want this? Maybe, your sisters are like that by nature. Now you are doing wrong, Sumbul. Am I doing wrong or are you coming between Khizer and I? Why would I come between both of you? Why do you like coming
in front of Khizer so much? When I have asked you
not to come in front of Khizer, you still come in front of him. I was coincidentally passing by, had I known Khizer was there, I would have never gone there. Yes, you are so great! You want me to get divorced and congratulations, Khizer has threatened me. What? How could he say something so big? Sumbul, you don’t worry, I, I will talk… Don’t you dare, don’t you dare talk to Khizer. Don’t come between Khizer
and me now. And I will make your life miserable
if Khizer divorces me. I won’t let you live in peace anywhere as well, do you understand? Ghaznavi will come back after a few days, I will also return then, meanwhile, you guys have to
take care of the house. Yes, Madam. Okay tell me, did someone come to meet
us in our absence or any call for us? No, madam, no one came but there were a few calls for Sir so I informed Mr. Jaffar. Okay, you guys may go now,
carry on with your work. Umm, excuse me. Hello, Jaffar. Greetings, Madam. Greetings. Umm, Ghaznavi is not attending my call, where is he? Umm, he, umm, he just left for the meeting. For the meeting? Aren’t you with him? Yes, I, I am just leaving. What do you mean by you are just leaving? You know he has a lot of enemies, you must always stay with him like a shadow. Yes, whatever you say. Go, immediately go to him, and don’t leave him alone. Yes, yes, Madam. Make me talk to him once
he gets free from the meeting. Okay, sure, Madam. Sir, Madam called. What was she saying? She was asking about you, when I told her you had
left for the meeting, she started getting angry at me
as to why I let you go alone, I should have been
with you like your shadow. She does care a lot about me. Sir, I am not convinced that madam is betraying you. At least, try talking to her once. You? What do you want? Inform madam, that Sarfaraz
is here to meet her. Regarding what? I will tell that to her. I am her brother-in-law, go tell her I am here. Younas. Tell madam that her brother-in-law
Mr. Sarfaraz is here and wants to meet her. Okay. Madam, your brother-in-law Mr. Sarfaraz is here. Sarfaraz has come here? Okay, go seat him down, I am coming. Okay, madam. Madam is asking to send him inside. Sir, please, you may go. Sir, please, come. Your house is very beautiful. How can the choice of
Nosherwan Ghaznavi be ordinary? No, no, it’s legit worth being praised, it definitely is. By the way, you must be thankful to me for living in this luxurious house. Hadn’t I left you in that
apartment the other night, you might still be living in
that small house of your dad or you would have been married
to some middle-class man and you would have been
taking care of his children but that didn’t happen, you, look, you are living in this luxurious house because of me, right? Why have you come here? I went to drop Fiza home so I found out that you are here and I also got this news from the office that Boss won’t be here for three to four days, so I came here. What is the purpose of coming here? You are the purpose. Go away from here and never come again. No, no, no, I will keep on coming and
no one can stop me. It won’t be nice if Fiza
finds out anything about this. So, what do you think? Does it make any difference
to me if she finds out? I don’t care whether her
heart is broken or mended. What do you want? I want you. I want to spend some time with you, now, you decide the place, though I don’t have any
objection in meeting you here, I just want to spend some time. Did you get the answer? This is not needed at all. He will have tea at his home. Take him out. Sarfaraz came home, madam slapped him and
got him out of the house. Madam came home for a while and then she went to her mother’s place. Ask your guards to be with madam
like her shadow till I get there, I won’t bear any negligence. Okay, I will do it right now. Greetings, Brother Sarfaraz. Come. Come. Greetings, -come.
-Greetings. Greetings. Sit down, please. Have food. I won’t have food. Tea, shall I get tea made for you?
Sania will make good tea. Yes, I will have tea. I will make tea for you. Umm, I will make it myself. I will go to Fiza. Leave my way. I won’t easily forget what
you have done today. I will leave you there at the same place and you won’t safely
come out of it this time, do you understand? What’s about to happen to
you won’t be good. What I have done today, I should have done it way before. You just take care of your sister now because I will tell her, I will tell your family, I will tell everyone that it was me who
you used to secretly meet and it was me because of whom
your father threw you out of the house. Have you forgotten that night? Fiza? Fiza? Fiza, listen to me? Fiza? Fiza, look at me. Fiza? Fiza, listen to me, it’s not what you think it is, I will tell you everything, I will explain. Enough Fiza. Such a huge betrayal. Okay, enough. It was my husband who made
my sister’s life miserable? No, Fiza, no. What will I do now? Please, enough,
I am unable to bear it. Please. I, how will I bear all this? Yeah? My love, I hid all this from you to save your home, forgive me, it’s my mistake. I was unaware but he wasn’t. Dua, he is my sinner and yours as well. Fiza? Where is he? I… Fiza? Fiza? Where is he? Fiza, listen to me. Leave me, I want to talk to him. Fiza? My child? Listen to me, my child. Sarfaraz? Fiza? Fiza? The coward ran away. He ran away. Fiza? I am your sinner. Don’t do this to yourself. No, no, Dad? Dad, call him, I want to talk to him. I will go and talk to him myself. Fiza? Fiza? Come out of this craziness. You are not going anywhere, my child. No, Mom, let me go, I will have to go. This man hasn’t given me
a single day of peace and should I just let him go after
knowing the whole truth today? No, I won’t spare that coward, Mom. Fiza? You won’t go there alone, all of us will come with you. You are coming alone such late at night? Where is your wife? She is at her mother’s house. Hey? Who did she get
permission from to stay there? What happened to him? He went without informing. What do I know? Ask your daughter-in-law. I pray she never comes back here. My issues with Khizer can never
be resolved if she comes back. He just patched up after
so much difficulty. That is the problem with you guys when it’s all love, everything seems right and as soon as you guys get married, you start seeing flaws in each other. You guys start fighting like cats
and dogs with each other. No matter what happens, poor Fiza is suffering
because of your issues. You are still supporting Sister-in-law? I am being honest. I can identify what’s genuine
and what’s spurious. I can see you have been defending
your daughter-in-law a lot these days. What will happen now?
Fiza has found out everything, how will I get out of this trouble? It won’t be nice if Fiza
finds out anything about this. So, what do you think? Does it make any difference
to me if she finds out? I don’t care whether
her heart is broken or mended. What do you want? I want you. Sarfaraz? Sarfaraz? Sarfaraz? Come out, Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz? What happened, my child? Why are you shouting? You call your son, ask him to come in front of me. The one whom you call your son, he has ruined the lives
of both my daughters. It was your son who pushed my daughter Dua in
a marsh of defamation in the name of love, your son. your son. Your son kept on raising
fingers at my character, right? He hasn’t just ruined the life of my sister but God knows how many more girls. Sarfaraz is a predator, calling him a human being
would be an insult to humanity. What are you saying, my child? I cannot tell the humiliation
I am feeling right now. Hey, why are you crying? He will cry now. You can question me if
I am unable to make his life miserable. How dare you guys?
