[22.68] Greetings.
[24.56] What is the update
 on the passport?
[34.32] You are lost in deep thought.
[35.44] What are you thinking about?
[37.88] Nothing happened.
[53.32] This.
[59.12] What is this?
[71.48] What?
[74.44] What is this?
[77.28] What is this lipstick 
stain doing on your shirt?
[83.76] It’s not a lipstick stain.
[84.96] Then what is it?
[91.92] I’ll go change.
[97.92] It’s better if you understand
[100.04] that Nosherwan
[101.36] loves Farah more 
than he loves you,
[103.92] men don’t forget
 their first love this easily.
[121.64] She’s my wife.
[123.16] Then who am I?
[124.84] Who am I, Ghaznavi?
[128.84] You showed me dreams of love,
[132.08] and then sacrifice 
also came in my share,
[134.20] why?
[135.76] Why?
[139.72] I don’t want to repeat the past.
[147.68] Well, if not like that, 
then it's fine this way.
[150.20] I have to make you 
mine somehow, right?
[153.08] Sorry, Ghaznavi.
[154.76] You must’ve heard,
[156.64] everything is fair in love and war.
[189.80] I’m sorry to call you at this time,
[191.68] I know you must be with Dua.
[195.08] Actually, I was really 
worried for you,
[196.88] who knows what Dua will
 think after seeing that stupid lipstick stain?
[200.76] You know that
[201.76] was really accidental.
[205.80] These things
 only happen accidentally.
[210.00] Oh, so it’s you?
[214.08] Yes,
[216.72] it’s me.
[219.76] A wife forced to spy on her 
husband's affairs and his mobile.
[226.40] Well,
[228.64] at least I have achieved 
the status of being a wife,
[234.40] and you,
[237.04] you must already 
know your introduction.
[241.88] Did you see the proof
 that Ghaznavi was with me?
[246.60] Yes, I saw it.
[250.20] But this tells me
 about your character.
[253.40] Stop your nonsense.
[255.44] Ghaznavi was mine
[257.52] and is mine and 
will always be mine.
[259.64] Who knows how many girls
 like you will come into his life
[262.64] and leave?
[267.24] Don’t make such claims 
that you regret later on.
[271.28] And then
[272.64] you have no other way 
left than to commit suicide.
[276.12] You will go to a mental institute,
[278.12] And I will make Ghaznavi 
mine and show you.
[283.80] Good luck then.
[286.08] If you haven't succeeded 
so far with your efforts,
[291.56] then keep trying.
[296.24] I will turn this arrogance 
of yours into dust.
[300.76] I will wait for that.
[336.64] Dua, where did 
you go that day, huh?
[339.20] And why were you not meeting us?
[341.00] Mama, Papa, Sania?
[341.88] They are all fine.
[343.16] They are all fine.
[344.60] This…who are all these people?
[346.44] They are with me,
[348.24] for my protection.
[349.08] All? All of them?
[353.96] The phone’s not with me,
[356.00] how should I find out 
everything immediately
[358.16] that what you went 
through after that night?
[384.28] Did you ask anyone for coffee?
[386.52] Yes, I did.
[389.28] Do you have any plans
 to go out somewhere?
[391.64] No
[393.68] Why?
[395.72] I’m not in the mood.
[398.32] Your mood will 
change if you go out.
[400.92] I’ll reserve a table for tonight.
[402.84] Call Farah before calling
 for a reservation.
[407.64] Sorry,
[409.52] I received her call by mistake.
[437.72] Sister-in-law,
[438.52] sister-in-law,
[440.56] sister-in-law,
[441.36] I’m making tea for myself, 
will you have some?
[443.12] You leave it, I’ll make it
[444.76] Hey, why will you make it,
[446.24] ever since you came 
you’ve sent me on holiday.
[447.92] You shouldn’t give sisters-in-law 
this much freedom.
[451.92] You’re like my sister,
[453.80] I love you like 
I love Sania and Dua.
[457.40] I know,
[458.72] I’ll bring some nice tea
[459.56] then we’ll sit and talk, okay?
[461.36] Sumbul.
[462.40] Hmm
[462.92] Can you give me your 
phone for a while?
[471.32] Phone?
[472.72] I wanted to talk to Mom,
[474.76] I was missing her.
[476.56] Yes, yes, I’ll bring it,
[477.84] definitely.
[491.28] Sister-in-law.
[492.08] Yes
[492.36] Here you go.
[493.04] Thank you
[494.80] I’ll tell brother to get
 a phone for you
[496.80] so that you don’t have to wait for me 
whenever you want to talk to your mother.
[500.28] Don’t tell Sarfaraz, please.
[504.88] I won’t tell him.
[507.28] You talk to her, 
I’ll bring the tea quickly.
[509.20] Will you take something 
else with the tea?
[510.44] No,
[511.32] let’s just drink tea together.
[512.68] Only tea? Done.
[531.60] Who are you talking 
to on the phone?
[539.64] Who are you talking
 to on the phone?
[543.72] No one.
[547.08] Whose phone is this?
[551.08] Your friend has given 
this to you, right?
[553.08] No, no one…
[555.16] Whose phone is this?
[557.52] Brother, this is my phone.
[565.40] This is my phone
[568.52] Hey, what happened?
[569.80] What’s the matter?
[570.88] The matter?
[571.96] You’re the one 
who’s home all day
[573.52] and you’re asking me 
what the matter is?
[575.80] She was talking to her
 friend on the phone
[577.60] and I caught her.
[580.64] For the love of God,
[581.96] don’t put such 
a big accusation on me,
[583.92] I…I wasn’t talking to anyone.
[587.36] What are you talking
 about brother?
[588.92] I gave sister-in-law the phone,
[590.80] she wanted to call home.
[592.64] This is your phone?
[595.44] I’ll deal with you later,
[598.48] first let me deal with her.
[600.08] What manipulations are you doing
 in my daughter’s name?
[603.92] My daughter is innocent.
[606.24] If your lover’s calls come on her 
phone tomorrow, then?
[612.60] What will happen?
[613.52] Tell me, she’ll get caught in this.
[615.64] You’re misunderstanding.
[618.48] Sumbul is like a sister to me.
[621.20] Look,
[622.56] there’s no need to include 
my daughter with your sisters,
[625.88] do you understand?
[628.24] One minute, one minute, one minute,
[629.96] let’s find a solution 
for this right now.
[631.92] Give me the phone.
[637.88] Only your dad has 
a phone in the house, right?
[640.44] Let’s see right now
[641.84] if this is his number or not.
[643.64] Let’s see.
[649.88] This is not his number.
[654.48] Who were you talking to?
[656.84] Who is this?
[662.96] Hey, what will she say?
[664.48] These girls don’t have any traits
 of respectable women.
[669.48] One girl ran away
 and the second one,
[671.52] we’re suffering the second one,
[676.80] whose lover’s calls
 are coming to our house.
[678.72] I’m ready to take as big 
of an oath as is necessary,
[681.56] I wasn’t talking
 to a strange man.
[685.48] Then whose number is it?
[687.20] Should I call it myself?
[701.20] School teacher,
[702.36] my colleague,
[704.40] she didn’t come in today.
[706.60] Before calling Mom, I thought
[709.40] I would tell her the work.
[711.00] You keep telling lie after lie,
[712.84] how many more lies will you tell,
[714.08] how many lies will you 
tell to hide your lies?
[716.88] If sister-in-law is telling you then
[719.16] she must be telling the truth,
[720.68] if you guys don’t believe her then
[723.04] I’ll call the number and see,
[725.56] let’s see if it’s a girl 
or someone else.
[736.24] No, no, put it on speaker.
[738.32] Speaker.
[749.16] Give me your number
[750.00] and I’ll contact you, alright?
[754.60] Yes Fiza, what is it?
[766.92] No, this is Sumbul speaking.
[769.52] Sister-in-law Fiza’s sister-in-law.
[773.24] Sister-in-law will call 
you herself in a while,
[776.40] thank you, goodbye.
[786.60] Who knows why she made her 
sister-in-law call, instead of calling herself?
[790.92] Should I call?
[793.04] No.
[794.28] She might get in some trouble.
[803.96] Are we done?
[805.68] Are you both relieved now?
[807.80] Did you find out who 
sister-in-law was talking to?
[810.00] She was talking to her colleague.
[814.08] That’s fine,
[815.92] but how did her colleague know
[818.68] that it was Fiza’s call?
[822.32] Mom, honestly,
[823.36] you should’ve been in the FIA,
[824.88] you’re very suspicious.
[826.28] Hey man, I’m telling the truth,
[828.48] did that girl get a revelation
[830.44] that it was Fiza calling?
[832.24] Hey,
[833.16] in school you have to give 
one number for emergencies,
[836.80] so sister-in-law
 must’ve given mine.
[838.60] Now obviously,
[839.84] she must’ve saved it
 with sister-in-law’s name.
[841.32] Yes so,
[842.36] what need did she have
 to give your phone number?
[845.08] If something goes wrong 
tomorrow or some other day,
[846.64] we are the ones who 
will have to suffer, right?
[850.88] I will make you understand
 one thing very clearly,
[854.96] keep my sister away 
from these things
[857.08] and if I find out
[859.08] that you’ve given her phone
 number away to someone else,
[862.52] then there’ll be no 
one worse than me,
[863.48] do you understand?
[890.04] I was waiting for your call.
[893.32] Why?
[894.88] Did you want to see
[896.48] if I’m burning in the 
fire you’re igniting?
[899.68] What?
[900.64] What did I do?
[903.96] First, you meet me 
and create proof,
[907.24] and then you broadcast
 it and tell my wife.
[917.80] Is this less?
[920.84] I called you.
[923.28] Now what do I know if your wife 
picked up your call to spy on you?
[927.80] Why did you call?
[933.48] When I’ve made
 you understand that
[934.88] we have no relationship,
[936.16] neither can we ever have one.
[942.00] Why do you 
constantly annoy me?
[944.28] You're humiliating me for 
the sake of that worthless girl?
[948.56] Everyone knows where
 you picked her up from.
[951.00] Beware.
[955.44] If you say anything
 bad about Dua,
[959.48] I will forget that I ever had
 a relationship with you.
[963.16] You've come and 
set her up against me,
[966.44] you’ll have to listen now.
[967.84] For the last time,
[970.68] I am explaining it to 
you for the last time,
[973.60] stay away from me.
[975.64] And I’ve also told you,
[978.56] I’ve already lost you once,
[980.12] I can’t lose you again.
[981.60] I love you.
[989.36] But I don’t anymore.
[998.36] I will make you mine.
[1060.12] Sorry sister-in-law,
[1061.92] such a big fuss was created 
out of such a small thing.
[1065.64] Why are you saying sorry to me?
[1070.28] I should be the one 
who thanks you.
[1074.76] Thank you, Sumbul,
[1076.88] if you hadn’t handled
 everything then
[1081.08] I wouldn’t have been able to 
maintain this lie any longer.
[1085.40] Lie?
[1087.68] What lie?
[1090.44] Wasn’t this your colleague?
[1095.72] Then who was she, sister-in-law?
[1104.28] Dua
[1106.88] Dua, sister Dua, your sister?
[1109.32] Yes, yes.
[1111.88] If brother had found out,
[1113.60] he would’ve gotten very angry.
[1116.96] That’s why
[1118.80] I couldn’t have taken her name.
[1121.52] I tried so hard but still,
[1122.92] such a big accusation 
was put on me.
[1125.32] No sister-in-law, please don’t cry.
[1127.64] You should’ve told me earlier,
[1129.80] I would’ve handled things sooner.
[1132.28] But still,
[1133.12] things haven’t gotten that worse.
[1136.64] Did you ask sister Dua,
[1138.12] where she is, how she’s doing,
[1139.60] when she’ll come, why she went?
[1142.44] Gently!
[1143.64] For the love of God,
[1145.44] if anyone hears her name
[1148.44] then it’ll be hell all over again.
[1159.80] Thank you,
[1160.64] thank you Sumbul.
[1182.28] A wife forced to spy on her 
husband's affairs and his mobile.
[1187.24] Did you see the proof that 
Ghaznavi was with me?
[1189.88] Ghaznavi was mine
[1191.76] and is mine and 
will always be mine.
[1193.96] Who knows how many girls like 
you will come into his life
[1197.08] and leave?
[1197.88] This.
[1203.64] What is this?
[1209.20] What?
[1212.08] What is this?
[1215.04] What is this lipstick stain
 doing on your shirt?
[1221.52] It’s not a lipstick stain.
[1248.16] I have to tell you something.
[1256.52] I’m sleepy.
[1275.48] 1000’s of women like you 
and Farah come and go,
[1279.24] but I’m here forever.
[1280.72] And don’t forget
[1281.88] that I’m talking to you while 
sitting in Nosherwan’s parent’s mansion.
[1343.32] Even since I met Dua,
[1345.52] I just wanted to fly over here
[1348.24] and tell you all what happened.
[1351.08] Thank God that Dua is alright.
[1354.92] Mom,
[1355.72] Mom was telling that
[1356.92] there were also cars with 
gunmen in them with the Sister,
[1359.44] she’s not held captive 
by anyone, is she?
[1362.36] No,
[1363.76] our Dua isn’t held
 captive by anyone.
[1366.08] Give me some tea.
[1375.96] By God’s grace,
[1378.80] my daughter was 
saved from destruction.
[1384.72] By the way,
[1385.44] I was scared at first too by 
seeing the guards and all the guns but then,
[1389.72] when Dua said that
[1391.68] they’re there for her protection
[1393.28] then I felt relief.
[1395.08] Sister has gotten 
so much money that
[1396.80] she also has guards
 for her protection?
[1399.84] Then her house 
must be huge as well,
[1402.56] maybe like a castle?
[1404.72] Maybe.
[1408.32] It seemed that way.
[1415.64] How did sister look,
[1418.08] is she the same?
[1420.44] No.
[1422.08] She’s gotten even more
 prettier than before.
[1429.68] I feel scared,
[1432.92] will she even recognize us or
 not after getting so much wealth?
[1437.36] Are you mad?
[1439.08] If she was arrogant about money,
[1440.48] would she be running after me like
 that in the middle of the traffic?
[1443.88] I didn’t even see her.
[1448.44] My girl is very pure-hearted,
[1451.88] she loves everyone very much.
[1454.52] She used to annoy 
you the most as well.
[1457.04] Sania, that was before.
[1460.56] She was annoyed as well.
[1467.28] What past matters have you 
guys started dwelling on?
[1470.80] We’ve found Dua,
[1472.44] we’ve found out about her,
[1473.56] is this not enough happiness for us?
[1475.56] No, you told us all this.
[1478.56] My heart is relieved after hearing it.
[1482.00] That Dua is happy and safe.
[1485.16] No matter how much
 I thank God for it isn’t enough.
[1489.24] I want to meet sister,
[1491.20] I miss her very much.
[1500.00] Did she give her address,
[1501.68] will we go meet her?
[1506.76] No, I don’t have her address. But
[1509.16] this, I took her phone number.
[1514.64] But we don’t have a phone,
[1516.96] how will we talk?
[1518.40] Okay, stop, stop it.
[1521.16] She’s happy,
[1522.00] I’ve felt relief hearing that.
[1524.00] Don’t foster too much
 hope for meeting her.
[1531.68] If your dad hears this
[1534.08] then all hell will break loose.
[1542.24] Fiza,
[1543.60] you should stay 
away from this matter.
[1545.92] Your in-laws are already angry,
[1548.40] they might stir up some 
more trouble for you.
[1554.56] What will you find out?
[1555.84] That who she…
[1558.60] She didn’t do it, 
I’ve told you so many times,
[1561.88] my sister Dua isn’t like that.
[1564.12] That’s enough, quiet.
[1567.56] If you take her name again,
[1569.08] I’m telling you,
[1569.80] I will leave you forever.
[1573.24] What do you mean Mom?
[1574.60] We’ll never be able to meet sister,
[1576.88] she won’t come over to our house?
[1580.60] Maybe.
[1590.96] There is no place for her in 
your father’s heart or in this house.
[1604.00] May she be happy
 wherever she lives.
[1614.80] Sometimes you have to take a bitter
 sip for the happiness of your loved ones.
[1627.12] Okay,
[1628.44] I’ll pray prayers of gratitude,
[1631.00] and for my daughter’s 
long-lasting happiness.
[1635.76] Eat this as well.
[1640.28] What is this sister,
[1642.16] we’ll never be able to 
meet sister our entire life?
[1649.48] Mom is right Sania,
[1654.08] sometimes seeing our loved ones happy
 and praying for their happiness
 to last is enough.
[1662.24] Anyway,
[1664.32] what will Dua do 
by coming here
[1666.48] and meeting us?
[1669.04] Hurt her heart by listening to 
people’s gossip and their taunts?
[1674.40] Just like mom,
[1676.16] now I also don’t want
[1680.00] Dua to ever return back here.
[1699.68] May you be happy 
wherever you are Dua.
[1708.04] Sister, have some tea,
 here you go,
[1710.16] drink your tea.
[1712.00] You haven’t eaten anything,
[1713.56] eat some, I made it myself.
[1747.52] You came back early,
[1751.40] is everything okay?
[1754.44] Yes, I just have a little headache.
[1759.08] I’ll bring the medicine.
[1764.68] Sit down.
[1772.76] If I say that
[1773.80] the cause of this pain 
is your anger, then?
[1779.80] I’m not upset.
[1782.00] Okay.
[1785.64] Then why didn’t you tell me
[1786.84] that you met Fiza yesterday?
[1791.16] I thought you must’ve
 gotten the reports.
[1793.40] Hmm
[1795.96] But if you had told me yourself,
[1799.28] I would’ve felt happier.
[1804.12] I wanted to tell you but…
[1810.52] You’re upset with me
 regarding Farah, right?
[1814.40] You feel like I haven’t
 told you the truth.
[1820.56] Should I not be upset?
[1823.48] You’re absolutely
 right in your place.
[1828.08] But I didn’t want to hurt you
 by telling you about my past.
[1832.08] And if I say
[1835.44] that you hurt me more by
 hiding it from me, then?
[1841.76] Then I owe you an apology.
[1848.12] I don’t want your apology.
[1851.08] Can’t I get forgiveness?
[1860.96] I wanted to tell you everything 
about Farah myself.
[1873.32] Look, Farah is my past
[1877.56] and my past has no 
place in my present.
[1888.96] If anything is important to me,
[1892.08] it’s my present.
[1900.52] And my present only has you.
[1919.36] Don’t you trust me?
[1923.60] Who am I not to trust you?
[1933.44] But whenever someone
[1935.28] like Kashmala or Farah
[1941.16] comes pretending to
 be obedient to you,
[1945.48] I turn into a scared little bird.
[1954.36] Who has no home of its own,
[1960.00] I have nothing, no one.
[1967.88] Where have you picked me up from?
[1974.40] I feel scared
[1977.84] that if Kashmala or Farah
[1982.72] they take you away from me, then?
[1990.96] Where will I go?
[2001.96] I will be left empty,
[2005.32] completely empty.
[2009.64] I will never leave you.
[2016.88] This is my promise to you,
[2022.48] I will never let you be empty,
[2029.84] you can be sure of this.
[2034.44] I’m only yours.
