[23.00] Inspector, my daughter is innocent.
[27.64] She is not guilty,
[28.88] please let her go.
[31.44] There are some serious
 allegations against her,
[36.68] her co-wife has registered
 an FIR against her.
[39.24] She is an eyewitness.
[43.36] Then how can you say this?
[45.60] Our daughter can't do anything like this,
[47.72] she is not the kind of person.
[50.80] We are very respectable people,
[52.96] you come to our neighborhood,
[54.80] ask the whole neighborhood,
[56.88] we are very respectable.
[58.52] We are respected by everyone.
[60.60] When your daughter was trying
 to trick a rich man into marrying him,
[65.20] where did your respect go then?
[69.64] And now you are here
 to clarify things on her behalf.
[73.00] You should have married your greedy daughter 
with someone of your own standard.
[76.80] Why did you marry
 her into a rich family?
[80.64] Go now, bring a lawyer.
[83.00] Inspector my daughter is innocent,
[87.00] how will she stay in a lockup?
[89.56] She should have thought about 
that before poisoning him.
[95.80] Now go from here. 
Don’t waste my time!
[98.04] Go away.
[106.36] They couldn’t handle 
their own daughter.
[108.96] When she kills someone,
[110.92] they come here, 
wearing the garb of decency.
[117.76] Why are you looking at my face?
[118.92] Go now!
[131.24] I did not poison Ghaznavi,
[133.24] I didn’t kill him,
[134.12] I can’t take anyone’s life,
[137.32] I am your daughter, 
you trust me, right?
[140.88] I can’t do anything like this, 
please believe me.
[145.72] We believe you,
[148.00] you can’t kill anyone, child.
[152.96] I am…
[153.80] I am really scared.
[155.52] I am really scared, Father.
[158.84] I am really scared.
[160.20] Child, don’t worry.
[161.84] We are trying to get you out of here, 
don’t you worry.
[165.48] May God protect you, my child.
[189.84] What will we do now?
[192.72] Mother, have some water.
[195.36] How will we free Dua?
[205.00] Aslam,
[206.68] our daughter can’t take anyone’s life.
[209.44] Yes, even I don’t believe
 that Dua can kill anyone.
[214.84] I don’t understand Fehmida, 
what should I do?
[219.60] What is there to understand?
[222.28] Hire a lawyer, we will fight the case.
[230.88] We will go in front of the judge and say,
[233.72] that our daughter did nothing,
[235.28] she is innocent.
[243.56] That is alright,
[245.08] I’ll talk to a lawyer.
[248.16] You don’t worry,
 everything will be sorted.
[251.12] How can I not worry?
[253.84] I can’t bear to see
 Dua in this condition.
[260.80] Please do something.
[261.80] For God’s sake, do something.
 Get my daughter out.
[273.12] Mother, calm down.
[274.16] You will get sick 
if you keep crying like this.
[276.76] Yes, Fehmida, 
this way you’ll get really sick.
[286.20] God, when will our trials end?
[296.80] Nosherwan, Nosherwan, 
what’s wrong?
[298.32] Water…
[299.36] Water, water! 
[300.32] Here, have some water. 
[302.20] What is wrong?
[305.32] Nosherwan!
[307.20] Is anyone there? Is there anyone...
[308.04] What was in the food?
[309.60] Did you poison it?
[310.92] No,
[312.72] no, Ghaznavi!
[314.16] What have you done? Tell the truth,
[316.00] was there something in the food Dua?
[317.76] Nosherwan!
[319.32] Jaffar!
[320.04] Nosherwan are you okay?
[329.08] My son tried to turn dirt into a crown.
[331.68] That’s the exact reason 
I used to stop him from doing that,
[333.80] because people of low birth and
 low status are never loyal to you.
[340.68] You’ve proven
[343.36] that my thoughts 
about you were correct.
[349.48] Nosherwan’s foolishness!
[353.80] He has prepared 
the tools for his own death.
[376.44] You?
[378.04] Here?
[378.84] Yes, I just got the news
 that you got arrested.
[381.12] You poisoned Ghaznavi?
[386.32] Look whatever it is Dua, I. 
I don’t believe
[388.80] that you can do anything like this.
[390.80] And you…
[391.44] you don’t worry, I am with you.
[394.40] Go away from here.
[398.60] Even if you don’t need me,
[401.24] I can’t leave you alone
 here in this situation.
[404.48] And I’ll see who can 
trouble you like this.
[410.76] Whatever it is,
[412.28] I won’t let you stay here for long.
[414.20] I promise you, I’ll get you free.
[415.92] I don’t need you.
[420.48] Go away from here.
[423.40] Dua, I have really loved you,
[426.24] and I will keep loving you.
[429.24] You’ll see, you’ll see,
[431.28] when I get you free from here,
[433.56] then you’ll realize
[435.16] how much I love you.
[437.24] I would never leave you alone
 in this condition.
[439.40] For God’s sake,
[440.88] go away from here and
 stop coming after me.
[446.60] Fine,
[449.00] but I’ll get you free from here,
[452.72] then only you’ll realize that
[455.84] I really love you.
[475.08] Hello.
[476.96] Sir Jaffar,
[478.40] Dua got arrested from her place.
[482.04] What?
[483.56] Yes, Ma’am Kashmala 
went herself to get her arrested.
[488.72] Alright.
[501.24] Sakina, quickly bring the soup.
[508.56] And where is the juice?
[509.72] I’ll just bring it.
[510.68] Oh, just bring everything together.
[517.64] Madam?
[519.16] Hmm?
[521.36] I want to talk to you about something.
[523.52] Yes, go ahead.
[525.64] I just got the news that
[529.84] police arrested Madam Jr.
[534.64] So?
[538.04] So, did you get her arrested?
[542.68] Whatever you want to ask me,
 ask me clearly.
[547.92] You didn’t even inform me
[551.84] that you are taking such a big step.
[557.32] Have you lost your mind?
[559.60] Think about who you are questioning!
[565.64] I apologize.
[571.32] The social standing, honor, and rank, 
that you have in this house,
[576.16] the same social standing,
 honor, and rank,
[580.12] is of Madam Jr.
[587.44] This is why I asked you.
[589.52] You have asked me today,
[591.76] but don’t ask ever again.
[595.96] And Jaffar, remember 
one thing clearly.
[598.72] You are a servant, so act like one.
[601.12] Don’t try to be the master.
[604.08] I apologize,
[610.04] but why did you do this?
[614.72] She was poisoning my Nosherwan,
[616.60] I saw it with my own eyes.
[618.52] Should I have let her go? 
Should I have left her?
[626.68] Nosherwan is quite proud 
of your loyalty towards him.
[632.08] But I can clearly see 
where your loyalties lie.
[635.48] Not for us, but it is clear from whom.
[640.96] No Madam,
[644.44] my loyalties have 
always been to this manor
[646.28] and the people of this manor.
[649.48] And as far as Madam Jr. is concerned,
[652.28] you all know
[653.40] how much Saeein loves her.
[660.96] He doesn’t want that
[662.44] she faces any kind of pain.
[668.04] That is why I asked you all this.
[673.84] I did what I felt right.
[680.72] And before you ask me 
any questions, understand this,
[684.00] I am not liable to answer 
any questions of yours.
[686.88] Madam,
[689.08] if you did not like me 
questioning you like this,
[693.84] I truly apologize.
[697.76] Go get the car.
[700.24] Go.
[703.96] Sure.
[722.40] Put everything in the car, hurry.
[748.44] Greetings,
[749.20] Amma Saeein, Baba Saeein.
[750.92] Greetings.
[759.28] Amma Saeein, I have brought food.
[764.16] Shall I get it served?
[766.36] Kashmala.
[768.08] Yes, Baba Saeein?
[769.96] Did you get Dua arrested?
[782.88] Yes, Baba Saeein.
[788.68] Why didn’t you take into confidence 
before doing such a thing?
[794.84] Baba Saeein,
[798.24] I couldn’t see Saeein in this condition.
[803.08] I had to get his culprit arrested.
[807.12] This is why I took such a step.
[813.64] Now, you can look 
after the further process.
[823.48] I didn’t expect this from Dua,
[826.20] that she could go so low.
[832.52] Nosherwan cared for more 
deeply than for his own life.
[841.76] And she,
[843.76] she tried taking our son’s life?
[852.72] Amma Saeein,
[855.72] Nosherwan Saeein is not 
good at reading people.
[862.48] The police came,
[865.00] to take Nosherwan’s statement.
[868.40] He is in a state of unconsciousness.
[871.84] They informed us that
[874.92] you got Dua arrested.
[877.32] You should have at least told us.
[879.96] Baba Saeein,
[880.84] I didn’t want to trouble you all.
[885.12] Anyway,
[886.40] someone had to take this step,
[891.92] so I took it.
[900.00] Jaffar,
[901.44] you brought food for Amma Saeein
 and Baba Saeein, right?
[905.00] Then why aren’t 
you getting it served?
[906.68] Get it served,
[908.36] go.
[910.12] Yes.
[930.04] Why have you come here?
[934.92] I wanted to talk to you.
[937.16] So, you’ll call me here for that?
[942.28] What if someone sees us, then?
[944.00] What do you want to talk about?
[948.36] Why did you get her arrested?
[951.64] Why are you here? Tell me that.
[955.32] I had to come.
[956.44] It had become important.
[961.56] Because you took such 
a step without asking me first.
[964.76] Why didn’t you tell me?
[966.88] You work for me.
[969.76] I don’t work for you that 
I would ask you everything,
[972.36] provide you with all the information, 
and then make a decision.
[974.52] Kashmala, look,
[976.20] whatever was decided among us,
[979.08] it was never mentioned that
 you would hurt Dua.
[983.96] The only thing we had planned
 was to separate the two, that’s it.
[989.68] Are you getting hurt?
[994.04] Didn’t you take money to destroy her?
[996.64] Now what happened?
[997.40] Why are you pitying her?
[998.68] Hey, whatever it is,
[1000.76] I am just telling you that
 you will not harm her.
[1003.48] I will get her out on bail and 
you won't come in the way.
[1005.44] Her bail is impossible.
[1007.96] Whatever it may be,
[1009.28] Ghaznavi is still alive,
[1010.40] when he regains consciousness
[1011.84] and gives a statement,
[1014.84] it would not be against Dua.
[1016.64] So how will you prove
 that she is guilty?
[1018.40] She is guilty
[1020.16] because I have declared her guilty.
[1024.28] Now whether someone 
accepts or doesn't,
[1026.40] I don’t care.
[1028.16] I know very well who is doing all this.
[1032.12] Why are you using your brain so much?
[1034.12] Mind your own business.
[1036.16] And if someone sees us here,
[1037.92] we will have another trouble,
 now go away from here.
[1040.48] I am telling you this for the last time,
[1043.20] I will get her out on bail and 
you will not come in the way.
[1059.04] What are you doing here?
[1062.96] I am just standing here.
[1063.88] Can't I stand here of my free will?
[1065.60] Can't I go anywhere on my own?
[1067.44] Tell me.
[1068.04] Oh, no, actually,
[1070.16] Amma Saeein and Baba Saeein
 are asking after you.
[1075.12] I am going.
[1133.44] You’re playing with fire.
[1135.44] Oh, I really don’t want to play with fire,
[1138.44] that’s why I’m telling you
[1140.36] to quietly go back to
your parents’ house.
[1145.40] Or, if you don't want to go there,
[1148.32] go to Sarfaraz.
[1150.20] Isn't that the best option?
[1154.68] What hasn't he done for you?
[1156.60] He’s made so many big sacrifices,
[1158.28] even left his wife for you.
[1170.68] You did wrong when you came 
between me and Nosherwan.
[1174.20] You poisoned his food
[1176.12] and committed the crime, 
but I’m the one doing wrong?
[1181.80] When you rot behind bars,
[1185.56] then you’ll realize
[1188.32] the mistake you made by coming
 between Nosherwan and I.
[1218.52] Dua,
[1219.36] I have hired a really 
good lawyer for you,
[1221.48] and hopefully, till morning,
 he will get you out of here.
[1228.76] Once the court opens,
[1230.68] he just has to go through 
some procedures
[1232.32] and then he will 
get you out of here.
[1239.92] Fine,
[1242.24] it's fine Dua, hate me 
as much as you want.
[1250.44] Insult me as much as you want,
[1252.88] I’ll still try to get close to you.
[1258.20] Dua, I am really worried about you.
[1261.64] I know this is all Kashmala’s
 doing because of Ghaznavi.
[1268.00] Look if Ghaznavi thinks that
[1270.80] you tried to kill him,
[1273.76] are you going to sit here 
and grieve all your life?
[1282.88] I can’t leave you here in anguish.
[1286.72] Dua, please, listen to me.
[1313.84] Greetings.
[1321.56] What happened?
[1322.88] You were gone for so long.
[1325.72] The lawyer kept me waiting,
[1327.68] I was waiting for him.
[1330.04] He met me quite late, 
that is why I got late.
[1335.68] What did the lawyer say?
[1337.52] What will happen to our case?
[1339.72] He will get Dua out, right?
[1341.16] Oh, getting her out comes later,
[1343.92] first the lawyer has asked for his fee.
[1347.36] I don't know what to do.
[1352.56] How much is the fee?
[1354.52] I have some savings. 
I’ll take that out,
[1358.96] and I have a little gold jewelry…
[1362.72] how much is the fee?
[1364.80] He is asking for one hundred and 
fifty thousand rupees just to take on the case.
[1367.20] How will I give him that much?
[1368.04] Tell me.
[1368.88] one hundred and fifty thousand rupees?
[1369.88] I don’t understand, Fehmida,
[1371.16] I don’t understand anything.
[1372.12] My head is spinning.
[1373.88] I don’t know what to do,
[1375.24] I am really helpless, very helpless.
[1381.92] So, now…
[1384.68] now we won’t be able 
to fight the case.
[1387.44] Will our Dua stay in lockup?
[1434.48] Hello?
[1436.28] Yes,
[1437.52] what is the report on Dua?
[1439.64] First, her parents 
came to get her out,
[1442.96] they are putting in a lot of effort.
[1445.52] Her lover also came.
[1448.04] Lover?
[1449.96] Sarfaraz?
[1451.48] Yes, yes,
[1452.92] and he said that he would
 bring a lawyer tomorrow.
[1458.08] Regardless of whoever anyone brings,
[1460.08] or whatever happens,
[1460.96] she should not get the bail.
[1462.76] You get it, right?
[1464.36] Oh, madam,
[1465.48] now that you have said it, 
she won’t get the bail at all.
[1469.36] This is why I am paying you
[1471.72] so that you do as I say.
[1473.52] You should not worry that 
she would get the bail.
[1477.08] We’ll put more charges on her.
[1479.44] She’ll rot in here.
[1482.60] That is good,
[1483.88] and
[1484.72] you’ll keep getting paid extra for it.
[1568.36] Why have you all come here?
[1569.84] You all should have gone to court.
[1572.12] We are here for Dua’s bail.
[1576.72] My client is innocent.
[1578.88] You have kept her locked up unlawfully.
[1581.96] You should talk about this in court,
[1583.92] not here.
[1589.64] She isn’t just charged
 with poisoning,
[1592.08] but your client has also
[1594.12] fraudulently made Mr. Ghaznavi 
name his property in her name.
[1601.00] And they also have proof of that.
[1603.12] That is all a lie.
[1604.68] My daughter is innocent.
[1611.52] That is the truth,
[1613.40] she is innocent. She is not like this.
[1616.12] That is the truth.
[1618.12] It would be best if you go to court,
[1619.60] and try for her bail there.
[1621.52] If she gets the bail, 
then you may come to me.
[1624.36] Then I’ll decide whether 
to let your client go or not.
[1644.08] Did Dua confess
[1646.64] that she poisoned Nosherwan?
[1648.68] Madam till now she has not confessed.
[1651.64] What are you getting paid for then?
[1654.32] You couldn’t get her to confess till now?
[1656.80] Madam, give us some time.
[1658.56] We are working on it.
[1660.08] We will make her confess.
[1662.08] It has taken a lot of time.
[1664.20] This should have happened by now.
[1666.68] Just wait a little longer, Madam.
[1671.28] Did someone come for her bail?
[1672.84] Yes, Madam.
[1673.88] Her parents came,
[1675.08] and Sarfaraz came with a lawyer.
[1678.52] Listen to me carefully.
[1680.44] Under no circumstances
 should she get the bail.
[1683.36] Madam, don’t worry about it.
[1685.32] She won’t get the bail at any cost.
[1687.12] We’ll get her to confess
 her guilt till the morning,
[1689.60] and after accepting the guilt,
[1691.00] there is no chance of getting the bail.
[1696.56] This is what I expect from you.
[1711.60] Say it,
[1712.88] you poisoned your husband.
[1716.44] I didn’t poison him.
[1718.12] Look, you have to say it,
[1720.00] that you poisoned your husband.
[1725.36] Say it, girl.
[1726.24] Otherwise, I will resort to other means.
[1728.52] Open your mouth and confess.
[1731.40] No,
[1732.56] I didn’t poison him.
[1735.56] Yes,
[1738.08] did she confess?
[1739.28] No sir,
[1740.28] she is quite stubborn.
[1743.68] What has happened to you a lot?
[1745.08] Don’t your hands
 work properly anymore?
[1747.44] You can’t even make 
a culprit confess her guilt?
[1750.80] I want this girl’s statement,
[1753.00] a statement of her acceptance of guilt.
[1757.84] Do whatever you want with her,
[1759.76] understood?
[1807.20] Nosherwan.
[1812.32] Saeein,
[1813.56] Nosherwan is regaining consciousness!
[1815.04] Hmm,
[1821.08] Nosherwan?
[1828.00] Jaffar,
[1829.00] go and get the doctor, quickly!
[1830.72] Yes Sir.
[1835.32] Nosherwan
[1840.24] My son,
[1845.16] Nosherwan.
[1852.48] Amma Saeein….
[1854.56] Nosherwan.
[1861.96] Thank God,
[1863.28] you are conscious now.
[1868.96] Congratulations to you all.
[1876.04] Thank God.
[1877.64] God has been merciful.
[1880.04] Our child has regained consciousness.
[1889.56] Thank you so much, Doctor.
[1890.96] You are welcome.
[1900.24] How are you feeling now Nosherwan?
[1907.92] Where is Dua?
[1915.20] Uh,
[1917.88] you are not well right now son.
[1920.56] You require rest, rest now.
[1928.32] Carefully, carefully.
[1932.16] I am fine Baba Saeein.
[1935.24] Where is Dua?
[1945.08] She has gone to her mother’s place.
[1947.56] Where else would she go?
[1950.76] Jaffar.
[1952.92] Yes Sir?
[1954.32] Go and bring Dua.
[1959.68] Yes Sir.
[1963.04] Dua is not at her mother’s place.
[1968.72] If she is not at her mother’s place,
 then where is she?
[1978.80] She is in lockup.
[1988.76] She is in lockup?
[1991.44] Why?
[1996.36] Because she….
[1998.68] Because she tried to kill you,
[2006.08] that is why I got her arrested.
[2008.60] You shouldn’t have done this.
[2016.80] I shouldn’t have done this?
[2021.44] Nosherwan?
[2022.76] What else should I have done?
[2025.00] Should I have left you dying like this?
[2035.04] I saw her give you poison 
with my own eyes.
[2046.84] You have regained 
consciousness after two days.
[2049.12] Look at your condition,
[2052.48] and you are saying
[2054.76] I shouldn’t have done this.
[2062.32] Jaffar.
[2064.36] Yes Sir?
[2065.92] Go, get her out.
