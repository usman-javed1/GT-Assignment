I have the entire video of the night 
you went to meet your lover, and I will make it viral 
if you don’t listen to me and go to meet Mr. Sarkar. This was the reason for your worry, right? I have brought it. Till I am alive, Zunaira or no other person 
in the world can harm you. Here you go, finish it with your hands, so that I never see the fear of 
something happening again. Till I am there, nothing will happen. When Ghaznavi watches your video and takes you out of his life 
by divorcing you, himself, then you will understand 
what I am saying. I don’t care about who was 
in your life before me, and who wasn’t. After today, no one other than me
 should have a place in your life. Keep the same trust in me, 
as you have in yourself. I will never embarrass you. That’s what I expect from you. Hey Dua, I'm envious of your fate. What a destiny you have, my friend. In what context are you talking? Are you really unaware? You know when Brother Nosherwan came, 
I was with Zunaira. Shamsher’s bones have been broken. He taught Zunaira such a lesson and then made her give up the video, 
it was really enjoyable. She's still sitting in shock. Didn't she tell you? He did. He has given me the DVD. So now you stay relaxed. Today’s lesson will be enough for Zunaira. In the future, she will think a hundred times 
before interfering in your life. Hmmm. By the way, he has given Zunaira a 
two-day ultimatum to leave the city, as well. I had no idea that he would 
do something like this, and even you didn’t tell me that 
he was coming here to teach Zunaira a lesson. When does he even tell me? Value him. Just stay loyal to them your whole life. Such appreciative people are found
 only by the lucky ones. Oh, Fehmida, 
we were just left to see this day. Your daughters have sworn to get their father humiliated 
by worthless people. What is poor Fiza’s fault in this? No, it is my fault, that I got married to an unfortunate 
woman like you and now three girls are hanging 
in my neck like a noose. What is wrong, Mr. Aslam? 
What are you saying? This is not the time to say these things. 
Our Fiza is in difficulty. If she is in difficulty,
then what should I do? Hey, we are her parents. 
Our daughter is not an orphan and her in-laws treat her
 the way they want. Oh, when he didn't get 
the decision he wanted, Sarfaraz even threatened to divorce her. Hey, Fehmida your daughters 
don’t have the sense or courage that they can handle their in-laws. That’s why I have to beg in front of the in-laws.
 You have to beg them. This is all the fault of your daughters. It is your fault, Mr. Aslam. I or my daughters have no fault in this. What are you saying? What do I have to do with this?
I am absolutely right. My daughter Fiza’s life is 
in difficulty because of you. What would it have cost you to keep 
the family matters within the family? You should have forgiven Dua 
and kept her at home. At least the character of these two daughters
 of mine wouldn’t be questioned. Who knows where that 
poor soul is wandering, and here we are sitting and 
lamenting over the fate of these two. Look, if you had brought up 
your daughters well, then today, neither you 
nor I would have had to see this day. Don’t blame me. I will blame you. I will blame you for everything. My daughters have been made 
a spectacle because of you. You are responsible for all this and 
I will never forgive you for this. I am telling you, 
I will never forgive you. I will never forgive you. Thank you. You didn’t tell me that you are going to Zunaira. Even you didn’t tell me. I had gotten scared about how you would react. The reason for getting scared? Do you still don’t trust me? I trust you the most. Then the reason for getting scared? What happened? Speak up. Now, if I have any fear then it is of losing you. Accepting me as who I am, how I am, you have elevated my respect. Those people had really scared me. I had gotten scared, that you… you might leave me. Even this thought makes me lose my breath. What if you also turn away from me? This will never happen. Trust me. I have just started trusting you. if something like this happens, then, my existence will be erased. I won't let it be erased. This is my promise to you. Brother Naseer, your son has not only cursed my daughter 
but also me, by putting this allegation. Why? What did he say that 
you are getting so upset? You, be quiet.
I am talking. Hey, he threatened her with divorce. Is this not a big thing for you? Look Sarfaraz has made a mistake. I apologize to you on his behalf. Hey, what will your apology do? Your son should apologize to all of us. What do I apologize for? You go to your room. I am talking. No, papa, let me talk. I too want to know what 
he wants me to apologize for. Your daughters are recovered, 
sometimes from the police stations, sometimes from ill-reputed places, 
and I should apologize? Are you in your senses?
Boy, talk with respect. I will not talk with respect. 
What will you do? And if you are so interested, then take her from here. I too am not interested 
in keeping her here. I don’t know what sort of character she has. Do you understand?
Hey, if you say another word, then I will pull out your tongue. Okay. Okay. So you are unable 
to handle your daughters, and you will pull my tongue? Mr. Naseer, is this the upbringing 
you have given your son? Hey, why are you questioning our upbringing? Had you brought up your daughters well, then you wouldn’t have had to 
get humiliated in front of us today. Hey, Sister Kausar, 
you are a mother. You show some wisdom. We have come here to mend the relationship
 and you are talking about breaking it? Yes, so I told you to take her from here. Now, should I give it in writing? Fine, I will give it in writing. 
Enough. Enough. It is enough. Now, not another word. We trusted your decency and married our daughter 
to your son, Brother. I am very embarrassed in front of you. Hey, why are you getting embarrassed? And whatever Sarfaraz said 
and went, is right. And madam, we too said yes to the marriage 
seeing your decency. But what happened? Your daughter ran away on 
the first night of the wedding. Now if one sister turns out to be like this, fingers will be raised on the other sister. Did you see? Did you see it? This is why you brought me here, forcefully, so, that they ruin the little respect 
that I have left. Brother Aslam, look, I will talk to Sarfaraz. I will make him understand. Hey, leave it Mr. Naseer. I have seen how much control 
you have over your son. You will talk to him? If something has already been settled, what's the point of repeating the same 
thing over and over again by calling him? By marrying into such people, the peace of my son's life 
has been utterly ruined. You called? Yes, I have called you. When I have told you 
what you want will not happen then what is the point of repeating 
the same thing in front of everyone? I have told you my decision 
and my decision is final. I cannot believe it. I cannot believe that a man with such 
a cheap mentality can be my son. Yes, then don’t believe it. Stop your nonsense. This marriage will only work 
when she listens to me. Hey, why don’t you agree to what he says? What do you want to achieve by 
making both father and son, fight? What do you want? Instead of supporting his wrong actions, you should make him understand, so that he gets rid of the madness 
that has filled his mind. I have told you my decision and it would be better that 
you don’t interfere in my matter, or else… Or else? Or else what will you do? Or else I will leave this home and go forever. Leave. Leave right now and don’t come back. What are you saying? Why are you standing? What are you waiting for? Leave. Why have you become 
the enemy of your son? And you. you… what do you want? Are you happy causing strife 
between father and son? Has it cooled your heart? I am leaving. Brother. Sarfaraz. 
Brother. Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz. Sarfaraz, I will not let you leave the home and go. 
For God’s sake, don’t go. Whatever is happening with me, 
is because of you. Leave me. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Mama. Sister-in-law. Papa. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. 
Sister-in-law, open your eyes. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. 
Hey, what new drama did she start now? Mama. Sister-in-law fainted. Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law. Child. Child, get up. 
Sister-in-law. Child you go call the ambulance. We will have to take her to the hospital. Wake up Sister-in-law. 
Sister-in-law. Child, that… If something happens to Fiza, I will not leave your son. Who are you calling? I am calling Fiza’s father, 
I have to tell him the entire situation. And if this becomes a police case, then you can keep on trying 
to save your son. Where is Sarfaraz? Call him. If something happens to her, 
we'll have to face the consequences. It's necessary for him to be here. Come on. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Sit in the car. Come on. You too come. 
You too come. Be quick. Be quick. Sit in the car. Come on. Come on. Sit. Hello. You disappeared after taking the price. Had I disappeared, 
how would I have answered the phone? What is the update on my work? It cannot be done. What do you mean it cannot be done? You took a price for this work. I have taken a price, I had also started throwing my cards. But Ghaznavi turned the tables on me
at the last moment. Nosherwan? How did he find out? You have stayed so close to him 
and you still don’t know him till today? He has ordered me 
to leave this city and go. And if I don’t do this, I can also lose my life. And what will happen to my work?
I don’t know. But, I cannot do your work risking my life. Deceiving me can cost you a lot. Right now, Ghaznavi has only found out that I threatened Dua. When he finds out that you gave me the money for this work, then think, what will he do to you? You won't even be left capable 
to call and threaten me. Don’t you dare try to threaten me again? What if, I am forced to take your name 
in front of Ghanzavi? Nosherwan is acting like Dua’s shield. Hey, what did you do? Huh? She is in the emergency ward. Hey, what happened as soon as we left,
that she reached the hospital? What happened to Fiza? She fell herself and why are you questioning us like this? Look, Aslam, pray for Fiza. Greetings. Doctor, how is my daughter-in-law, now? The patient is really unwell and the sad thing is that 
the child is no more. Where is her husband? There. He is here. Okay, so he is her husband. You are the same one 
who didn’t want the child, right? Congratulations, 
your plan is a success. You had wished that if not this way, then something should happen 
to that child that way. What are you saying? You ask your son. He didn’t want the child 
to come to this world. Even right now, 
I am not sure if Fiza fell herself or if someone pushed her. Anyway, when Fiza regains consciousness,
 we will take her statement. We will make a decision after that. Pray for her. Hey, you tried to kill my daughter. Hey…
I will kill you. What are you doing?
I will kill you. What are you doing?
What are you doing? He didn’t stay at home after you left. How can you blame him for everything? I know everything. My daughter is in this condition 
because of you. Because of you. Hey, fine, he is responsible. But, this is a hospital. 
Show patience. What are you saying? Huh? Instead of supporting your son,
 you are taking their side? Their side?
Hey, you be quiet. Let Fiza make her statement once, I will not leave you. Who are you threatening? 
Tell me, who are you threatening? If my son is not saying anything, then does this mean 
you get on my head? Huh? You come on. 
You come from here. I have to talk to you. Come on. I will see you. And why are you crying? Be quiet. It is a hospital. It is a hospital. Come here. 
Come here. What did you do? What did I do? Hey, how did she fall? How would I know? 
I left from there. I don’t know what you people 
are blaming me for. Once you left, 
she fell and lost her child. Even your father-in-law and mother-in-law
 know that you didn’t want this child. On top of that, even the doctor has recognized you. Now, if Fiza regains consciousness, and says something inappropriate, 
then what will we do? I don’t understand the need 
to come to this hospital. If that doctor says something, 
then we will be in trouble. Hey, when does your father listen to me? He brought her here. Now see, what you wanted has happened. This child is no more.
But what next? Think, what will we do next? This is a police case. Even I don’t understand anything. Now everything is in Fiza’s hand. If she wants, she can send you to jail, or she can set you free. Mama, hear one thing carefully. If she speaks any nonsense against me, then I will divorce her and go. Hey cool down. Cool down. Because of your anger, we've reached a 
point where there's a police case against us. What should I do? I will have to do something. Fiza, my child. Mama. My child is fine, right? Did you ask the doctor? My child is absolutely fine, right, mama? Fiza, your child is no more. What are you saying? 
This is not possible. My child cannot be separated from me. You are lying, mama. Mama, don’t lie to me at all. Ask the doctor. Call the doctor, I will ask them. Why are you saying this? Child, come to your senses. 
This is the truth. I am not asking you. 
I am telling you, call the doctor, I will ask them. 
They must know. What do you know right now? 
You know nothing. Child, this is true. This is what God willed. Accept God’s will. It is true, your child is no more. Mama. Mama, my child. Mama. Mama. No. Mama. No. Mama, no. Is it done? Can I go now? I would have liked it had you come along. I came from outside, 
I am a little tired. That’s why I am not insisting either. Had it not been necessary then 
maybe I too wouldn’t have gone. Uh-huh. Such business dinners are important. You should go. Hmmm. Have food on time. You too. Are you feeling okay? I mean, I think you are unwell, 
so should we go to the doctor, first? No. No. there is no need for that. I am a little tired. 
I will be fine when I rest. Okay, then you rest. You go without worrying, 
I will rest. Are you sure?
Hmmm. I will be worried for you. Fiza, child, I know this sorrow is huge for you. But believe me, this is as big for us. This was the first happiness of our home. That’s it, child. Have patience. My child. And yes, I admit that Sarfaraz is extremely 
short-tempered, child, but look at him. Since he heard the news 
of the child departing, he is shattered by this sorrow. Child, for God’s sake, forget everything. Don’t take it to your heart, child. Forgive him. Please, you people come out. The police are here, they will take 
the statement of the patient. Yes, child. Whatever there is, tell it to them honestly. Tell them how eagerly we were awaiting that child. We used to keep you with so much love. How much we cared for you, right? Come on, you people come out, please. Okay, tell them the truth. This is the third time 
you have called in such little time. Because I am worried for you. I felt that you were not fine. I am fine. You tell me, how do I make you believe? When you are fine, then I get the vibes myself, and I am not getting them right now. The party too is really boring. 
I am leaving from here. Fine, come on. When you are in front of me, 
you will believe me, right? You, be ready. 
We will go somewhere. Right now? Yes, right now. When you are with me, I lose track of time. Fine.
