[66.17] Zulekha, are you fine?
[68.20] Yes, Saeen.
[71.50] I told you
[74.50] if you call me to your home 
without my will,
[80.10] then you will see your end 
will your own eyes.
[82.70] I told you, right?
[86.07] Hey, Ghaznavi, it is done now,
[88.67] forgive me.
[90.10] Ghaznavi never forgives those 
who disrespect women.
[98.00] Your hands should be disabled so that
[104.07] you never lay a hand on 
a woman's honor again.
[130.93] Come on.
[151.47] Why are you going here? Don’t you 
want to take the last class?
[154.10] I am in no mood and, please, 
you too sit here quietly.
[160.23] After all, I have taken three classes 
because of you today.
[163.80] So?
[165.43] We took classes after 
such a long time,
[167.67] or else, we just come here,
[169.10] chat and go back home.
[171.00] Yes, so who comes to 
the university to study?
[174.13] And then people like us who were 
burdened by school and college,
[177.33] only come to the university to enjoy.
[179.23] Yes,
[180.47] if the attendance register 
reaches home one day,
[183.10] then we will know.
[184.30] Papa will scold me so much,
[185.80] and it is possible that he will not waste
 a minute in taking me out of here.
[189.33] Forget your father for a little while,
someday, when leaving home. Please.
[195.20] I cannot forget him,
[197.33] and even if I try to forget him,
[199.70] I remember everything after 
hearing papa scream
[202.77] as soon as I enter home.
[205.30] I told you, I had to face the loss
of the radio yesterday.
[208.20] Leave all this, look at this.
[210.47] The girl has danced so well.
[213.73] Who is this?
[215.63] She is my friend.
[218.53] Your friend is so rich?
[220.50] Yes.
[221.90] Earlier, she used to live 
in our neighborhood,
[224.13] then later on, her father and brother 
started sending money from abroad,
[227.87] and these people changed 
their neighborhood.
[229.90] Now, tomorrow is her 
brother’s marriage.
[231.90] She is so pretty.
[233.20] Right?
Yes.
[234.80] And look at her dress, 
it looks so nice.
[238.70] You are so lucky,
[240.17] you have such a rich friend.
[243.33] Going to such functions is 
just a dream for me.
[245.87] If you want,
[246.97] I can fulfill this dream of yours.
[250.73] How?
[251.90] The wedding is tomorrow. 
Come with me.
[257.97] How can I go?
[260.13] What will I say at home?
[261.67] Why do you need to tell 
anyone at home?
[263.53] Just say you're going to the university
[265.20] and then come to my place.
[266.50] And we’ll get ready there and 
then we’ll head out.
[268.73] Oh man, it’s a daytime wedding, right?
[270.27] We’ll be free from there anyway 
before evening.
[273.80] But I don’t even have any suitable 
clothes for such events.
[278.37] You don’t worry about the clothes,
[279.67] I have a lot. 
You just agree
[281.90] and we will go together.
[283.10] We will have a lot of fun.
[289.33] What are you thinking?
[295.90] Here, you too put it on.
[301.57] Should we kill our desires because 
of the restrictions of the family?
[307.87] Hey, come on, put it on.
[310.10] Clean it on your way home.
[312.33] Now, if the family doesn’t 
like us dressing up,
[314.83] then what can we do?
[317.23] Here, apply it.
[319.17] here you go.
[321.63] Apply it.
[323.13] You are right.
[359.87] I feel really anxious, 
shall we go back?
[362.30] Dua, please stand with me quietly.
[365.27] Do I look overdressed?
[367.63] You have put on a lot of 
makeup on me, today.
[370.60] You are getting confused 
for no reason.
[372.23] You look really pretty. 
What is wrong? Trust me.
[375.00] Hi.
[376.23] Thank God you are here.
[377.67] How could I not come?
[378.87] After seeing the video 
you sent me yesterday,
[381.00] I decided I had to see your 
live performance today.
[385.53] Sure. Err…
[388.87] This?
[389.73] This is Dua. My classmate.
[391.90] Hi. 
Hi.
[394.30] Okay, hurry up.
[395.30] The performance is going to start. 
Be quick. Come quickly.
[397.67] Yes, come on. 
Come on.
[399.20] She is even prettier than the video.
[401.33] It is all the magic of money. 
Come on.
[435.47] It is better that you go on stage 
instead of standing here,
[437.67] and move your feet.
[438.93] Are you crazy?
[440.50] Hey, what is wrong?
It is just family.
[442.87] Nothing will happen,
come on.
[444.20] Not at all.
[445.40] I won't be able to do it.
There are so many people.
[447.47] There's no choreographer or 
expert here to judge you.
[451.43] Come on. 
No, please, no. No.
[453.07] I am with you too, come on. 
No. No. No. No.
[611.23] Come on. Come on. 
We are really late.
[612.87] I will even get scolded at home 
if I tell them I had an extra class.
[616.10] We are not late at all.
[617.03] We will go home. 
What is the hurry?
[618.63] I have to go to your home 
and change as well.
[620.73] Hey, everything will be done.
[622.23] Tell me, did you enjoy it?
A lot.
[659.07] Greetings.
[660.37] Greetings. 
Stop.
[665.47] Why do you come back late, daily?
[669.93] No.
[671.20] Did I talk to you? Be quiet.
[674.70] Speak up.
[677.40] I had an extra class, today,
 so I got late.
[688.70] Where did the earrings
 come from?
[691.60] Where did you get 
these earrings from?
[695.77] Rida.
[696.77] They belong to Rida.
[698.13] She gave them to me to try 
but I forgot to remove them.
[701.20] Do you see, Fehmida,
[703.20] your daughter doesn’t go 
to the university,
[705.60] she goes to a fashion show.
[707.77] I forgot to remove them, sorry.
[709.20] I will return them tomorrow. 
Sorry. Sorry.
[716.00] Yes,
[717.33] Fehmida,
[719.73] you couldn’t give me a son,
[722.87] but you gave me this foolish child,
[725.07] now take care of her.
[785.07] I saw a smile on your face
 after so long,
[789.00] I liked it.
[791.07] Hmm.
[794.53] If you want, should I find out 
about that girl?
[808.43] I am sorry.
[813.03] Not right now, Jaffar.
[817.07] Right now, let me analyze,
[821.07] that whether she is really 
a good girl or
[824.77] did I find her to be good.
[830.50] Sure, Saeen.
[844.73] You almost got me killed yesterday.
[846.03] I got saved from Papa,
[847.13] then Mama scolded me so much,
 what do I tell you?
[852.33] What if we get late because 
of the photocopy?
[854.17] We won't get late.
[856.53] You find out about something trivial,
 and you get worried.
[859.17] Now tell me, do you want 
the notes or not?
[861.30] I want them.
[862.30] Yes, then stand quietly.
[866.13] Brother, make a copy of 
this entire thing.
[869.03] Okay, madam, but the machine
is not working,
[870.27] it will take some time. 
It will take time.
[872.40] So, no issue, 
it will get done.
[874.70] You make it. Make it. 
Hi.
[877.73] Hi.
[879.43] You are here, in the university?
[881.20] Actually, I came to meet a friend,
I saw you, so I came here.
[884.37] You tell me, what is going on?
[885.80] I am absolutely fine. 
This is my best friend, Dua.
[890.40] Greetings.
[892.20] Greetings.
[894.63] Who is he?
[895.63] I had told you,
[896.60] the one I recently started 
an affair with. Fahad.
[900.70] God knows how many affairs 
you have and then they end.
[903.40] How many do I remember?
[904.70] This is my friend, Faraz.
[908.10] Hello. 
Hello Faraz.
[910.30] Hey, man, you should have told me 
that you are coming here for a date, so…
[913.40] You look really handsome rough 
and tough too. Don’t worry.
[916.77] We will go sit somewhere 
and have a cold drink.
[918.90] Yes, yes, come on, 
we will go.
[920.37] No. No. I won't go.
[923.17] Yes, but why? 
Why won't you go?
[925.77] There is a lot of time for 
the copy to be made.
[927.83] Hey, so no issues, 
let’s stay here.
[929.40] I will stand here.
[930.53] You will stand here alone?
[932.30] Hey, when is she alone?
 Faraz is here.
[934.80] Till then the copy will be made, 
we will come back.
[936.67] Yes, good idea.
Okay,
[938.73] he will give you company, 
we will come.
[940.27] Rida. Rida.
[942.47] Ri…
[948.20] You are a really close friend.
[950.43] Yes. A lot.
[952.67] I think you too are unaware 
just like me.
[956.37] Maybe.
[957.97] Brother, how long will it take?
[959.70] It will take some time.
[963.03] So, come, we will sit and wait.
[967.00] Come on.
[968.33] No, if you want to go and sit,
then sit. I am fine here.
[972.07] Hey, he himself is saying 
it will take so much time,
[974.47] then we will go and sit somewhere.
[976.23] I…
[977.37] in fact, I will go home. 
When this is done,
[981.10] you give the notes to Rida.
I will take it from her tomorrow.
[985.17] Look,
[986.53] I am not as bad a man 
as you think of me.
[989.87] And Fahad is a really 
good friend of mine,
[994.30] he is like my brother.
[995.83] And because of Rida, 
you are respectable to me.
[1002.30] Don’t worry.
[1005.80] I am not worried,
[1008.57] I just want to go home.
[1011.33] Hey, they will find it so weird,
[1013.23] if you will leave from here 
before they come back,
[1015.10] they will think, 
God knows what I said.
[1018.47] Look, I am really a very decent man.
[1021.30] You come on,
[1022.53] we will sit and wait for them.
[1026.87] Come on.
[1040.77] Thank you.
[1044.93] Have it.
[1052.70] Rida is mentioned often,
[1056.53] but Fahad never told me,
[1061.10] that Rida has such a beautiful 
friend as well.
[1067.53] You know, I was not coming here today,
[1070.17] Fahad insisted, but had I not come,
[1075.37] I would have been really disappointed.
[1078.13] Disappointed about what?
[1081.77] That I didn’t see you,
[1085.17] I didn’t meet you.
[1094.03] I am getting late, I will go. 
Hey…
[1097.40] I am so sorry. I am so sorry, 
it was an accident.
[1101.10] I will go. 
Hey…
[1103.67] hey, listen.
[1107.80] What is this?
[1108.83] See it yourself.
[1110.23] Thank you,
[1111.60] I will go home and see. 
Rida, come on.
[1113.23] Hey, I am so sorry, 
it was an accident.
[1116.93] Rida, please come on.
[1117.80] Okay, let's get the notes. 
We will get them later. Come on.
[1120.57] Okay. Okay, bye. 
Bye. Bye.
[1123.37] What happened? I mean, 
you are behaving like this…
[1127.87] Hey, what did you say to her?
She is not stopping.
[1129.87] Hey, what could I say?
[1133.63] Now, do you want to go,
[1134.73] or do you want to drop her home 
with your eyes?
[1137.87] I wish I could drop her.
[1139.90] I think you really like her.
[1144.40] Think that.
[1145.77] Shall we go?
[1147.57] Come on?
Yes, man, come on. Come on.
[1193.00] I have told you so many times
[1194.73] when you enter the home, 
you should offer salutations.
[1197.87] Sorry.
[1198.87] Greetings. It slipped my mind.
[1201.27] How did it slip your mind?
[1203.23] Is this something that 
should slip your mind?
[1205.00] And where were you all day long?
[1206.13] Mama, I was outside with my friend.
[1207.90] You know my friend Fahad, with him.
[1209.53] Did you even eat anything
[1210.63] or were you going around aimlessly 
with your friend all day long?
[1213.07] I have eaten.
[1214.33] I am just going to my room to rest.
[1216.50] Tell Sumbul, not to disturb me.
[1218.50] It is time for the sunset prayers, 
is this time to rest?
[1221.87] Mama, I am going to rest, 
you just leave me.
[1224.93] Are you feeling okay?
I feel absolutely fine.
[1243.27] I am so sorry, 
it was an accident.
[1249.43] I am not as bad a man 
as you think of me.
[1252.23] And because of Rida, 
you are respectable to me.
[1258.00] Rida is mentioned often,
[1261.73] but Fahad never told me,
[1265.67] that Rida has such a 
beautiful friend as well.
[1272.13] You know, I was not coming here today,
[1274.47] but had I not come,
[1276.03] I would have been really disappointed.
[1278.70] That I didn’t see you,
[1280.10] I didn’t meet you.
[1323.00] Yes, go ahead.
[1324.50] Listen, I want you to do something.
[1326.93] What?
[1332.10] I want the number of Rida’s friend, 
Dua.
[1335.80] Hey, so the number, 
right now….
[1338.03] I don’t know. 
Where do I get it from, buddy?
[1341.47] Now, you can only understand.
[1343.50] Okay, give me two minutes, 
let me talk to Rida,
[1345.47] and then I will WhatsApp you. 
Okay?
[1346.87] Okay, I am waiting.
[1354.40] Dua.
[1382.63] What?
[1384.20] Do you think a girl on the road 
is your father’s property,
[1387.60] that it becomes your responsibility 
to tease and touch them?
[1400.13] And you?
[1401.07] When you leave the home, 
then be strong and courageous.
[1407.47] Now what are you looking at?
[1410.37] Move.
[1412.03] Will you leave or should I hit you?
Are you leaving?
[1420.47] Are you okay?
[1435.47] Where is this girl? 
She took so long.
[1450.77] Greetings mama.
[1452.07] Greetings. 
Where were you?
[1454.73] Mama, a boy was teasing 
a girl at the bus stop.
[1458.57] I taught him such a lesson 
that he will not forget.
[1460.93] Don’t get involved in 
the fights of others,
[1463.23] and also be careful 
about the time.
[1465.67] You know your father’s 
temperament, right?
[1467.90] I didn’t do it on purpose.
[1469.63] Be careful in the future.
[1472.90] Are you going somewhere?
[1474.73] And where are Fiza and Sania?
 I don’t see them.
[1477.23] It is Mr. Bakhsi’s grandson’s birthday.
[1479.93] Those two have gone there.
[1481.43] I too was going, 
I was waiting for you.
[1485.03] I will wait if you want to come along.
[1487.90] No,
[1488.93] what do I have to do going there?
[1490.40] They will have the same stale chips
[1492.43] and cold potato samosas.
[1494.27] Hey, I don’t want to go. You go.
[1495.53] Okay listen,
[1497.00] have food after you 
change your clothes.
[1500.07] I have covered it and 
kept it for you.
[1502.23] And I have made your favorite 
chicken today.
[1508.90] Okay. Okay.
[1509.93] And lock the door,
[1511.77] only open it when your father comes.
[1514.20] If someone knocks just like that,
don’t open it.
[1515.57] I won’t open it at all. 
Okay.
[1517.43] Come on, take care of yourself.
[1520.23] Lock the door. 
Yes. Yes. Yes.
[1544.50] Rida, you didn’t come 
to the university today?
[1546.60] Yes, I have a fever,
[1549.03] that is why I might not even 
be able to go tomorrow.
[1551.30] Okay listen, right now, I have called
you because Faraz forced me.
[1555.30] Since he has seen your friend, 
he has lost his senses.
[1558.47] He is asking for her number 
again and again.
[1560.77] I have told you so many times,
[1562.47] Dua doesn’t have a phone.
[1565.03] Look, I have given 
your message to him,
[1568.63] but he doesn’t believe me.
[1570.40] You talk to him yourself, 
he is standing in front of me.
[1572.27] Here you go.
[1573.53] Yes, Rida, how are you?
[1575.87] Does she not have a phone?
[1577.70] If she had a phone,
[1579.77] then why would I lie to you?
[1582.50] Yes, but there must be a way
to get in touch with her.
[1586.17] Look,
[1587.47] I couldn’t go to the university today,
[1589.63] and maybe I won’t be able 
to go tomorrow either.
[1591.63] Or else I would have let you 
talk to her on my phone.
[1595.90] Look, Rida, whatever it is,
[1597.87] find out a way that 
I can talk to her, please.
[1600.57] There is no way.
[1602.53] The environment of her home 
is really strict,
[1604.97] which is why she doesn’t 
even have permission
[1606.80] to go to the neighbor's home 
and talk on the phone.
[1608.23] By the way, for doing all this,
[1611.37] it's necessary to know,
[1613.40] like you've become obsessed 
with seeing a glimpse of Dua,
[1616.87] is she also obsessed with you?
[1618.90] Or is this fire one-sided?
[1621.17] I am restless to find out all this.
[1623.20] And listen, 
I have to talk to her today,
[1625.60] and if I don’t talk to her 
for two to three days,
[1627.77] I will give my life. 
For Fahad’s sake.
[1630.13] How do I tell you there is no way?
[1633.70] I just have her home address.
[1638.07] If you want, I can give it to you.
[1639.77] I went to her home once.
[1641.17] Yes, sure, tell me.
[1650.63] Thank you.
[1651.87] Okay, thank you. See you.
[1654.03] Are you satisfied now?
[1657.30] Yes. 
Come on.
[1667.93] Even Rida didn’t come.
[1669.97] Had she come, I would have 
asked her about Faraz.
[1673.10] I would have gotten some news,
[1675.17] that is he too thinking about me 
constantly like I am thinking about him.
[1689.60] I am coming.
[1698.13] Faraz.
[1705.53] How are you?
[1707.77] I came from so far only 
to meet you, to see you.
[1712.93] That day I saw you, 
now I didn’t understand
[1716.73] how I should come to see you.
[1722.53] I thought I would come 
and meet you.
[1726.70] Papa.
[1742.83] Who are you?
[1745.80] I was asking for an address.
[1752.47] Did you only see this door 
in the entire neighborhood?
[1755.40] And you,
[1757.13] get inside.
[1759.00] Give us the right address. 
We are coming. We are coming.
[1764.30] Leave from here.
[1767.53] Come on. Come on.
 Come on.
[1769.63] Leave quickly, brother.
[1771.17] Come on, leave brother. 
How would you know?
[1774.03] Why are you worried?
Sit in the car, drive quickly.
[1782.33] Who told you to tell these 
stranger boys the address?
[1787.47] Mama had said you would come.
[1791.77] It was time for you to come, 
I thought that you…
[1794.13] You thought so and you 
opened the door, right?
[1798.00] No…
[1798.80] You didn’t think how secluded the streets 
of the neighborhood are at this hour.
[1802.63] Anything can happen.
[1804.63] Sorry Papa, I didn’t realize.
[1807.43] I will be careful in the future.
[1808.93] I will be careful in the future.
[1813.30] What is the matter?
[1814.80] Just think my respect 
got saved a little.
[1819.67] What happened Dua?
[1820.67] Why are you asking her? Ask me.
[1823.03] When I entered the street,
[1825.87] she was standing at the door with 
two young men,  two stranger boys,
[1829.80] telling them the address.
[1831.23] They were asking the address 
and she was telling them.
[1833.30] Dua…
No, no,
[1834.67] Papa came immediately, 
I didn’t even talk to them.
[1837.57] Hey, thank God no one 
in the neighborhood saw it,
[1840.27] or else the entire neighborhood 
would have spit on us,
[1842.57] that Mr. Akram who was such a 
religious man, his granddaughter,
[1846.70] is standing outside and telling 
stranger boys, the address.
[1850.10] You shouldn’t have opened the door.
[1852.00] I had strictly told you not to.
[1853.97] Mama, I told you, 
I made a mistake.
[1856.23] I will be careful in the future.
[1857.87] Tell me something,
[1859.17] where did the three of you go 
for an outing leaving her alone?
[1863.03] It was Mr. Bakhshi’s grandson’s 
birthday, so we….
[1867.03] Mr. Bakhshi.
He's a real troublemaker.
[1869.57] He follows the customs 
of the British and Jews.
[1872.20] You should understand this.
[1873.63] From now on, you going to such 
foreign gatherings is completely over.
[1877.07] No one will go.
[1878.40] Sister Nudrat had really insisted, 
and then, we are old neighbors.
[1883.00] Hey sister Nudrat insisted 
and you went?
[1885.47] When she invites you to hell, 
then you go ahead.
[1887.43] I have told you people 
for the future,
[1889.13] that no one will go 
to such gatherings.
[1894.23] And Dua,
[1897.83] hear one thing clearly,
[1901.27] after today, if some boy,
[1903.27] some stranger stands 
outside the door,
[1906.17] I will surely murder him,
[1908.83] and I will also break your legs.
Understand?
[1912.27] Okay, I will make her understand.
[1914.60] You go and rest, 
I will bring water for you.
[1917.83] Yes, bring me water.
I am tired.
[1921.40] Your daughters will kill me.
[1927.23] I had told you not to,
[1929.63] then why did you open the door?
[1931.97] You don’t learn.
