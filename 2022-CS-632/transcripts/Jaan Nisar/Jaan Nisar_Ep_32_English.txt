How do you feel, now? I saw you, I feel really good. What was this? I had told you, I would not be able 
to live without you. So much madness
 is not good, Farah. Yes, I am mad for you. I have tolerated
 distances from you once, but if you leave me and go again, then I will not be able to tolerate it. Look, Farah, I have told you that… I don’t know anything. If I know something, then it is this, that I will not be able
 to live without you. But still, if you don’t care a little about my life, fine, you can leave me and go. What is the guarantee that I will go from here and you will not do this again? There is no guarantee because I don’t want to 
live without you. More precious than life, Dua. Since I've seen you, I'm unaware of day or night. I am lost in thoughts 
of you all the time, as if I've detached from the world, with only thoughts of you remaining. I have fallen in love with you. I have fallen in love with you. I will wear this suit. It is like this color 
has been made for me. What are you looking at? You people have still kept 
my things the same. Why shouldn’t we have? Did you get separated from us? Yes, but, I was just afraid you people too would 
think I am the sinner. Have you gone mad? It was my fault as well, Fiza. You just made the mistake of 
loving someone with flaws. Whatever happened to you, someone else's malicious intentions 
were involved in it. Dua, when God has blessed 
you so much, then you too forget that accident 
as a nightmare. It doesn’t matter what the world 
thinks or what people will say, because you are still the same
 old Dua for us, today. Okay? Our Dua. My Dua. Sister, come, tea is ready. Hey, so soon? I am sure you made really bad tea. No, why? She made it with so much love, with so much heart, with her own hands. Really? Then I will have to drink it and see. Come on, let’s go. Come on. Yes, I am coming. Be careful. I am telling you, be careful. Sorry. Sit here carefully. Now rest, I will order something for you to eat. Come on, now drink the soup, then you also have to take
 your medicine as well. My heart doesn’t feel like it. If you listen to your heart then how will the wound heal? Who wants to heal the wound? What is this? You will have to get fine. If I get fine, then you will not 
care for me like this. That’s why I don’t want to get fine. Come on. Drink it. Come on. Come on. That’s it. At least drink half of it. I even drank this 
much in your love, or else I didn’t feel like it at all. Here you go. Thank you. Are you feeling better now? Much better. Hmmm. Okay, you rest. I will go now. Stay for some time. I cannot stay, Farah. What is wrong with you? Stay for a little while. Hey, Sakina. Yes? Yes, madam? Is Ghaznavi back? No, sir hasn’t come home yet. Okay, did he call for me? No, he didn’t call either. Fine, you can leave. Okay. Can you not stay? It is necessary for me to go. Go after a little while. When I have to leave, then what is a little while
 earlier or little while later? I need you right now. Till now, my wound hasn’t even healed. Now, you should have thought 
about this before doing this. Has anyone ever thought and loved? You had left this love a long time back. Now, if someone has taken your place, then tolerate it. If I could tolerate it, then would have taken 
such an extreme step? Listen, Farah, I have promised Dua that I will never cheat her. And I mean it. I will never cheat her. You had also made 
a promise to me too, right? It is in the past, forget it now. You can forget it because you had left
 me mid-way and left. I am still there. Even today, I am only yours and I want to be yours. Yes, but my destination
 is someone else now. You don’t feel pity for me at all? I think you need to rest. I will tell Jaffar to arrange
 a maid for you. She will take care of you. Only you can take care of me. Fine. If you want to enforce a maid on me, then I accept this too. I will get the arrangement made. Take care. You will have to come again because I cannot control the 
madness inside me for long. Hmm? Goodbye. I will wait for you. Greetings, madam. Greetings. Where is Ghaznavi? He is in a meeting. At this time? He comes home by this time. Yes, an urgent meeting came up, that’s why. Okay, till when will he be free? He might just get free or it can take one or two hours. Oh. Yes, he is here. Madam is on the call. I am just coming home. Yes, madam, he is coming home. Fine. Your coffee. Coffee. Yes, thank you. What happened? What are you thinking? Nothing. If something is worrying you, you can share it with me. There is no worry. You know, I forgot to check my phone
 in my happiness. And when I checked it, I didn’t like it at all. There was no call or
 message from you. When I called your number was off as well. But, the good thing is that Jaffar told me you 
are in a meeting. Yes, at times, such emergency
 meetings come, so… You tell me, how do you feel 
meeting your own? Me? I feel, really, really, 
really, really, really, good. It feels as though, I met my own after a long time. Sania, Fiza, Mama, everyone was really happy. Really, really happy. And your Papa? He didn’t agree. He too will agree. At least, this much happened that he let you come inside, he let you meet everyone. All this is because of you. What did I do? Yesterday's Dua was nameless, insignificant. The position I have achieved
 today is because of you. Now, before anyone points
 a finger at me, they think a hundred times. Because you are Nosherwan
 Ghaznavi’s respect. Are you happy with me? With you? I am really, really, really, happy. You had also made 
a promise to me too, right? It is in the past, forget it now. You can forget it because you had left me
 mid-way and left. I am still there. Even today, I am only yours and I want to be yours. Yes, but my destination 
is someone else now. You don’t feel pity for me at all? Yes, what is the price of the apples? Sir it is three hundred rupees, but you take it for two fifty rupees. Two fifty rupees? Fear God. And this papaya? It is three hundred rupees for a kilo. Three hundred rupees? I got it last week for one fifty rupees. Leave it, man, you will not buy it. Brother, what is cheap and what 
is expensive for you? What do you mean? Meaning? Oh, the way your daughter
 arrived in that big car, and the guards with her, it will be amusing to 
see you argue like this. Neither did the car belong to me, nor the guards. Understand? It belonged to 
your daughter, right? It is the same thing. Hey, we even saw the time when you didn’t let your 
daughter enter your home. And we also saw with 
our own eyes the force she showed 
and entered the home. Now the neighbors are saying that your daughter
 has become very arrogant. How she was threatening
 in front of everyone that no one could stop 
her from coming home. And listen, did you ask her where she ran away to? And that police station? Listen to me. The daughter is mine, the problem is of my home, why do you have a problem? I am just talking, you are getting upset for no reason. You are talking. You are talking. Don’t talk to me. And listen to me, don’t make me speak up now. Your daughter got caught with 
the electrician on the roof one year back, did I talk about it? Should I tell everyone what she was doing with
 the electrician on the roof? Hey, just because 
I mentioned your daughter, you started dwelling in the past. Yes, so should I not? You will put salt in my wound, then I will also say a lot to you. Hey, leave it. 
It is useless to talk to you. Leave it. Go, then. Leave it, man. Get lost. Go. Yes, Brother, how much do you want? Yes, how much is it for? Hey, I just told you, it is three hundred rupees for a kilo. It is really expensive,
 I don’t want to get it. God will question you. Madam, do you want something? No, no, I don’t want anything. I just want to make 
food that Ghaznavi likes. Food that sir likes? Yes. So you tell me, I will cook everything. Hey, I told you, I would make lunch for Ghaznavi. Madam, if sir finds out that you worked, then he will not like it. Why do you worry? Just tell me, where is everything kept? Help me. So that I can make the food. Okay, I will tell you, then you take care of everything. Fine. I will take care of it, you don’t worry. Tell me, what is in the fridge? The fridge has chicken, beef, and even fish. There is everything… Madam. Yes, go ahead. How do I have to give
 you this medication? You should have asked the one 
who had told you to give me the medication. I am not sitting here 
to dictate to you. If you tell me once, then I will be careful going forward. Keep it here, and leave. I will have it myself. Now why are you standing
 here, staring at me? I told you to leave. I will have it. Leave. Go, open the door. It must be your sir, and bring him straight here. Go. Sure. You? Yes. Me. Sir has sent some fruits and he has also told me to
 find out how you are. Could your sir not come himself? He was busy. Hmm. I know about his busyness. This is Bano. She has my number. If you need anything, then call me. Has your sir put all the
 responsibilities on your head? Now sir has not been made
 for these small tasks. Fine. Leave. I will call you. Take good care of madam. This is sir’s order. Don’t worry. Keep it here. Who told you to bring him here? Madam, you had 
said that sir has come, I should bring him inside. Is this your sir? Yes. He is the one
 who employed me with you. Oh. You get lost from here, or else the veins of 
my brain will explode. Go from here. Sure. Hello. Where are you? In your heart. Okay come on, let’s have food. This is great. First the invitation for
 lunch at home, then all this arrangement. Is there something 
special about today? When I prepare something for you, it will be special, right? You made all this? Hmm. What was the need for
 you to go in the kitchen? Did you burn your hand? Show me. No, nothing happened. Thank God nothing happened, but had something 
happened, then? And what was the need for 
you to go to the kitchen? One minute, let me teach Sakina a lesson. Sakina. Please. Please. Please. Don’t say anything to her. She was telling me not to and she was also really scared, that you would scold her. Please. I insisted. What was the need for you 
to tire yourself like this? Hey, when did I get tired? I was making it for you with my interest and I liked it. But, instead of eating the food, and praising it, you started investigating. I am not investigating, I was worried about you. What if you had gotten harmed? Can I ever get harmed with you there? Never. But so much… No, ifs and buts. Nothing. You do one thing. This is your favorite. In fact, I will serve it to you. Eat it. Tell me, how is it? Okay then, you have made
 it with so much love, so I will have to eat it. How is it? Hmm. It is fine. It is just fine. It is okay. Okay, leave it, then. I will tell Sakina, she will make something. I am joking it is really delicious. You are not joking. I promise, it is really delicious. Are you sure? Promise. It is really delicious. Then eat more. I will. That’s it. This means, it is not good. See! It is really delicious, but you have made so many things. I will eat those too. You sure, right? It is really very delicious. What more will you have? I will try the biryani. Dish it out on your plate. Okay, I will go back 
to the office now. We will meet in the evening. The office, again? Yes, man, some work is left. I forgot an important 
file in the morning, I will bring it from the room. I will bring it. Three missed calls? Hello. Despite knowing my condition, you didn’t even come to see whether I am alive or dead. I had told Jaffar, he must have found
 a maid for you till now. Yes, the maid sent by your 
servant has arrived, and also the things
 you sent with your servant Jaffar. Now, I have become 
so insignificant in your eyes, that you’ve left me at 
the mercy of the servants. I was busy. You were busy. But you are coming here now, and we are having lunch together. Okay? I have had lunch. Fine, then I will not eat till you come and neither will
I take my medication. And if something happens to me, then you will be the only
 one responsible for it. What stupidity is this? Hello. Your file. Thank you.
