Sister? How are you? I am good. Greetings, brother Sarfaraz. Greetings. Won’t you come inside? Come, brother Sarfaraz. I tried when you asked me to, but there is no clue about that girl. I didn’t call you here to hear all this. Sir, the girl’s father 
refused to recognize her, and then that day 
Mr. M.P was visiting too, so with a lot of other girls, I released her as well, I don’t know where
 she went after that. That is all you could do? You came here to tell me you don’t know 
anything about that girl. After your call, I tried to trace her, I found out from her neighborhood that she did come but her father 
didn’t let her enter the house. No one knows where
 she went after that. So then find her. If she is not found, I will put your name in 
the list of missing people as well. Sir, I am trying… Enough. Let’s go, please. Sir. Jaffar, you may leave too. Yes, Sir. Greetings. Allow me to leave. Son, the tea is being made, at least have tea before leaving. I won’t have tea. I came inside because 
she insisted otherwise… Okay, as you wish. I will see him off. Listen, why don’t you stay for longer? I came to your house
 for the first time and did you see your father’s
 behavior with me? And you want me to 
sit here for longer. I guess Dad is upset because 
of the insult yesterday. So then let him be upset, he is behaving as if 
I made his daughter elope. You don’t mind his attitude, Dad doesn’t gel in with anyone, I wanted that when
 I come for the first time, he doesn’t leave disheartened. I am the one who felt bad and I won’t forget this insult, do you understand? Okay, listen, when will you come to pick 
me up in the evening? I was just asking so
 I stay ready in time, tell me when will you come? Never. Nosherwan… I am fine, I will do it myself. I am your wife. If I won’t take care of you, who else will? I can take care of myself, thank you. What happened? You are mad at everyone, you are even angry with Jaffar. I don’t consider 
it important to tell you. Why are you so 
mistrustful, Nosherwan? Husband and wife are
 each other’s clothes, secret from each other… You are wasting your time 
and mine as well. I can sacrifice my life 
for you Nosherwan, and you are talking about time? Why did the police
 come, Nosherwan? May I ask you? It will be better if you mind
 your own business, I am telling you very politely. You were taking some 
Dua’s name in your sleep, who is she? I am not answerable 
to anyone in this world. But I, I am your wife. Jaffar. Don’t call Jaffar, I will leave. Do have your soup. Sarfaraz is fine with you, right? I am the one who felt bad and I won’t forget this insult, do you understand? Where are you lost, sister? Where are you lost? Nowhere, why? Were you asking something? You don’t look like 
a newlywed bride at all. Why? Do I not look happy to you? Sarfaraz is fine with you? He is very nice to me. Whatever happened 
yesterday, sister, we were very worried 
for you after that. Why? Why were you worried? Hey, everyone takes very 
good care of me over there. It doesn't look like it by 
Aunt Kausar’s behavior. She heard it from
 somewhere all of a sudden so the poor woman
 reacted spontaneously, she is very nice by heart. Daughters even start 
lying after marriage. It has been so many days since 
I had tea made by Sania, and you just brought one cup, where is Mom? You have it. Where do we have to go, Sir? I don’t know myself, Jaffar. Wherever I can find out about Dua, let’s go there. Let’s go. Hi. I got this for you, look at this, a phone. I can't take this. Why not? Don’t you love me? I do but. But what? What will I tell at home? No one will know at home, you won’t tell anyone you have a phone and do you know, I will feel like talking to you 
more after meeting today, so now we cannot survive without this. How are you, sweetheart? What is this behavior? Ohhh! A new face. Fakhir, when did you come? Just right now. You could have told me before coming, why didn’t you call? I thought I would surprise you but I got a surprise when I came here… Uff... Fakhir, this is Dua, Dua this is my cousin, Fakhir. Okay. Actually, you are wearing my clothes so Fakhir got confused. I hope you don’t mind. Okay, you didn’t get ready yet, you had to go. Go, go, get ready. What do you do, we don’t have to tell her. You are mad. Hey, I didn’t know. People must be thinking
 you are very noble, but have you ever thought when I will yell and tell them what you have done to me, what will they think about you? What did I know that in search of freedom, Dua will show us this day one day? She was in search of freedom but she could never take this big step. My heart is not convinced that our Dua can do this. Sister, she kept on saying 
this while crying that we must listen to her and give her a chance to explain but Dad, Dad didn’t let us open the door. You guys should have 
given her a chance, at least you should have listened
 to her if she is a sinner or not. I tried, but your Dad… Yes, Dad shouldn’t have done this. Dus is his biological daughter, his own blood. How can he do this to her? I don’t know how my daughter must be. I have lost my sleep. It's so difficult to have
 patience when someone dies, how can I be patient on my Dua? Did you ask the neighbors? We might find out something about Dua, someone might have seen her going. Neighbors will do something
 only if they get done with defaming us and 
abusing my brought up. Then how will we find out 
about Dua like this? Sania, Dad, open the door. Wow, Mom, you can recognize 
Dad just by the knock and he couldn’t understand
 your emotions yet. You have started talking like Dua. Today, even I feel why wasn’t I bitter like Dua. I have told you 1000 times 
to open the door quickly. Greetings, Dad. You came back after two days? Uncle said to go and
 meet your family. What are you saying, Mr. Aslam? Daughters do visit their parents’
 house after marriage and it’s a tradition to come after 
the wedding reception. I don’t believe in these rituals. Understand And tell her not to come every other day and stay at her home 
where we have sent her. And listen to one more thing, be thankful that I didn’t behave
 with your husband the way I wanted to. I should have thrown him out 
of my house after how they insulted me. He is our son-in-law, and we are parents of a daughter, we have to tolerate all this. Why do we have to tolerate it? That’s why I used to tell you to
 give birth to boys, boys. Now look, how I have to face humiliation
 because of them. And listen, tea, get tea for me in my room, make it yourself. Move! Okay don’t worry you know his temperament. I am going to make tea for you Dad, will you have it? 
Shall I make it for you? Yes. Hmm, Sania, come sit here with your sister. You don’t take Dad’s words personally, you know he has this habit. Since when did my little one 
become so sensible? I had to. You left and sister left too. Dua had to go one day but like this… Yes, who are you and who do you want to meet? You? You are the one who fought with Dua in
 the parking of the mall? Yes, I am the same. Where is Dua? What do I know where is she? And why are you guys asking me? Do you guys plan on
 taking revenge on her? Just answer what 
you are being asked. Where is Dua? You are her friend, you would know where she is. I was her friend, I am not anymore. And by the way, who stays friends with girls who have no respect in society? What does that mean? I mean that's how we talk about such a girl. Thank you. One minute. You don’t know where she is? Look, I actually don’t know where she is and 
what happened to her, so please keep me
 out of this matter, and don’t ever come here 
again to ask about her. Thank you. Jaffar, keep an eye on this girl, she might know everything about Dua and can be hiding it from us. You are absolutely right. Go and bring the daughter-in-law back. I wanted to talk to you about
 something important. First, bring her back then I will listen to your 
important thing as well. Greetings. Let’s go. Sit inside for a while. I have come to pick you up, so let’s go now. Who is it, Fiza? Umm. Greetings. Greetings, why are you standing outside, son, come inside. No, I am in a bit of a rush. So, you guys first eat and then go, it’s time for dinner. I won’t have food. Some other time. I will just take the veil and come. I am waiting outside. Your job has been arranged. There is no need for an interview 
when I have spoken to them, Seth Raees just wants 
to meet you once, he wants to meet you for his
 own satisfaction to see that since I have
 praised you so much, are you even up to 
his standards or not? He has arranged a meeting at his
 house so you don’t have to wait for longer. Ma’am Zunaira has sent you, right? I just told you. Okay, fine. Who is calling? Madam. Yes, madam? Is everything okay? I hope she is not making 
any noise, right? Yes, everything is fine for now. She is a new bird, be careful and stay vigilant. Don’t worry. If she makes much noise, don’t give her any leverage. Yes, whatever you command. May I come in, Sir? Come in. Why has this door been closed? Open the door. Don’t make noise. Open the door. Come to me. Open the door. Open the door. I am not that bad, sweetheart. What happened, Sir? What happened? What happened, Sir? What happened to you? Sir? Sir? Hey, hey where are you going? Leave my hand, leave me, let me go. Hey, take out the car. Please leave me. What kind of a girl has madam sent? She injured Sir. We have to take him to the hospital. And do tell your madam, we will ask her when we come back. That’s it, I will take it, I will take it. I have hands. You forgot to add salt. Where are you lost when 
you are cooking? What are you thinking? You forgot. I guess I forgot. I should eat it as is? No, I will just add in it. No, I don’t want to have it. This experimental food you cook, feed it to your daughters and yourself. Pick it up, I don’t want to have it. What happened? Do you want to say something? Quickly say it. I will say it but promise me you won’t get angry. I won’t make such promise. Say what you want to and if you don’t want to
 say it then don’t say it. So, you should have 
found out about Dua. God knows how 
my daughter must be. You took that shameless 
girl’s name again? Who defamed 
me in the whole city. For God’s sake Mr. Aslam, have mercy on that unfortunate, at least find out where she is. Why should I ask her? Hey is there any greater
 reason than disobedience? You cannot even imagine, 
Fehmida Begum all that I had to hear at 
the police station the other day, why didn’t I die of shame? My heart says Dua is innocent. You like to place burning 
coals in your hand, I don’t. She is dead for me and the dead never gets alive. I spared her this time but if she comes in 
front of me ever again, I will strangle her myself, take this away otherwise I will throw it. I work all day and I don’t even 
get a meal in a day. Did I shelter you for this day? That’s how you are 
going to reward me? Had I known you 
are such a bad woman, I would have never 
taken favor from you. I will make you pay back
 for my favors with interest, do you understand? I will die but I won’t do what you 
are asking me to do, I will never do it. Even your father will do it, you just need to lose your ego. When you will stay 
hungry for a few days, you would even get
 ready to eat the dead. Be afraid of God’s wrath, aren’t you scared of God? You have betrayed me. You have betrayed me. For God’s sake. Take her away. Come. I am asking you to take her away. Leave me, leave me, leave my hand, have some fear of God. Leave me. Umm, what do you think, will she agree? Zunaira has fixed big people, did you forget you weren’t that easily 
convinced either? For now, I am just worried about Sir’s anger. He is such a huge builder, I wanted to get land
 from him and this girl… she broke his head and
 ruined everything I did. You get lost too! I will see how she won’t agree. Zunaira. Open it. Open it. Don’t lock me here. Open it, open me, please. Open it. I won’t live here. Take me out. Take me out, please, take me out. Where did you go, Dua? Shall I get you food? I am not hungry. You will have to eat because you have to take medicines. I said I am not hungry. How won’t you eat food? You cannot have medicine
 on an empty stomach. Why don’t you
 understand at once? Why are you after my life? I said I am not hungry, it means I am not hungry. What is it, Nosherwan? You went somewhere 
during the day as well. Are you worried? Yes, I am and who can know the reason
 for my worry better than you? Go away from here. Sister-in-law, you must rest for now. This is not a very tough job, we will do it together. I won’t let you do any work 
without you making the rice pudding first. Then you can work
 later on and I will rest. Okay. You can rest then, in fact, why then? Rest from now only. Oh ho, I have to do this as well. Come on, let’s go. Listen, here is the list of groceries, we are out of groceries at home, send it through someone. We already have a person more to eat. Sometimes you talk rubbish, it hasn’t been many days since 
daughter-in-law came to this house and you started counting her bites? I just generally said it but I am noticing you don’t hear a word
against daughter-in-law, I don’t know what have I said that you have disliked so much. Dad, I wanted to talk to you 
about something important. Yes, yes, listen to him as well, he has been looking for 
you since yesterday, I don’t know what is so important. Okay, hurry up and speak, 
I have to get to the shop. I want to divorce Fiza. Are you out of your mind? Are you mad? Do you hear yourself 
what you are saying? I know very well 
what I am saying, I want to divorce Fiza. But why? Why? You are still asking that question. Didn’t you see what they 
did to us at the wedding? Didn’t their reality 
reveal in front of us? Whatever has happened, who told you that this 
is all Fiza’s fault? Whose younger sister is like that, how she would be herself? What rubbish are you talking about? It hasn’t even been two 
days to your wedding and you are talking about divorce? Enough Dad. I have decided. I don’t accept any 
such decision of yours. How is this justified that you punish your wife 
for someone else’s doings? Both of them have been 
brought up in the same house, they would even be of 
the same nature. In fact, we don’t even know 
what she must be doing. I think you have
 watched some movie that is why you are saying all this. Are you listening to what he is saying? He is right, what will people say, they just got married
 had a reception and now we get a news 
of divorce from their house? What will people think? You guys don’t 
care about your son. What has happened to you that you have come to such 
an extreme decision? And then you are
 asking us to support you. I don’t want to keep any relation 
with a family whose daughters are… Okay enough! Maybe, what is their younger
 daughter’s name? That… Yeah, Dua. Dua might be completely innocent, some guy must have taken 
advantage of her innocence, and she might not be at fault. Then what will you say? Dad, whatever it is, this relationship won’t work out. This is my final decision. Enough! I don’t want to hear a word more. I am trying to make you
 understand and you… You won’t take any such step and if you did something like that, I would be the worst to you. Do you understand? Don’t you worry, daughter, I am with you.
