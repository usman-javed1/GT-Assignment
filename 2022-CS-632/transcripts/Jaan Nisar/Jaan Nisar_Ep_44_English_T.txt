[28.84] I was yet to teach her a lesson,
[31.56] why is she leaving so soon?
[38.88] Did she come here to make me jealous?
[43.44] I won’t let her go from here so soon,
[46.96] how can I just let her go?
[72.24] Where are you going?
[73.76] I am going to iron Madam Jr's clothes.
[77.24] Madam Jr who?
[78.72] I am your only madam, that’s it.
[81.92] Okay, sure.
[86.44] This, bring this to my room.
[94.56] Quickly.
[95.44] Okay.
[121.32] What are you doing, Madam?
[123.16] Shh....
[124.16] Speak slowly, someone might hear you.
[125.80] Touching the iron like this 
will give an electric shock.
[131.08] Yes, that is what I want,
[132.40] I want her to get an electric shock.
[135.08] Do you want me to die?
[138.88] I want death but not for you,
[141.36] for someone else.
[147.60] Okay, listen.
[166.52] Do you understand?
[167.80] Very well.
[169.64] You don’t worry at all.
[171.72] Just go and keep it over there, okay?
[173.84] Okay.
[174.20] And you don’t touch this at all.
[175.60] Okay.
[185.64] It feels like our mansion
 has been completed today,
[189.08] there is only one thing missing.
[191.40] What is missing, Mom?
[194.68] Even I and Dua are with you.
[199.96] My eyes have been 
longing to see your child.
[204.40] Umm,
[206.80] your Amma Saeein is right.
[214.16] I wouldn’t regret dying 
if I get to see your child.
[223.08] Don’t say that Baba Saeein,
[225.64] you just get well soon,
[228.68] and we will give you 
the good news very soon.
[243.64] Pirah?
[245.80] Pirah, the clothes are ironed…
[250.36] Pirah?
[255.36] I am getting late and this?
[265.56] Dua?
[267.64] Dua?
[268.76] Dua, What happened?
[270.16] Dua?
[270.96] Dua, what happened?
[273.36] Pirah?
[275.08] Dua?
[276.20] Dua, get up.
[279.04] Pirah?
[299.72] Thank God, at least you picked up my call,
[301.12] I have been calling you for so long.
[303.76] When you know that I am ignoring you,
[306.16] then why are you calling again and again?
[308.36] Why aren’t you talking to me?
[309.96] What is my fault?
[311.32] It’s not your fault
[313.12] but my fault
[316.76] that I got married to you despite
 knowing your brother’s nature.
[322.76] And didn’t you see how he put 
a show at the restaurant the other day?
[327.44] Are you regretting?
[329.40] Your brother is forcing me.
[331.60] Don’t be mad at me.
[334.28] Do you know, this was our first 
official dinner after getting married,
[338.08] that your brother has
ruined by misbehaving?
[345.60] I don't know what issue he has with me.
[348.24] Dad has scolded Brother a lot,
[350.40] he will be careful next time.
[352.12] He is your brother,
[354.04] that is why you are defending him 
and saying all this.
[360.24] I know your brother very well now,
[363.12] he is not a human being,
[364.44] he is a monster, a monster.
[369.32] I feel sorry for Sister-in-law,
[370.48] how is that poor woman living her life?
[375.28] Okay
[376.04] now you promise me,
 you won’t be mad at me.
[379.16] It depends,
[380.88] it depends on your brother’s behavior,
[384.44] and I won’t make any promise that 
I am unable to fulfill in the future.
[388.24] You should have at least 
just said it to make me feel better.
[394.32] Hmm, I’ll try.
[401.36] Tell me something,
[402.52] you are getting your 
daughter married to him,
[403.84] are you also putting
 this house in his name?
[405.28] Don’t misbehave, Sarfaraz.
[408.00] I am not misbehaving,
[409.24] I just realized my value in this house today.
[412.76] And look at her,
[414.24] I mean,
[415.16] he humiliated her brother
[416.28] but she is shedding tears for him
[417.84] who got upset and left.
[419.12] For God’s sake,
[420.64] at least spare someone.
[423.08] Look, how worried she is.
[425.64] She just got married and 
you have put up this show.
[428.72] What show?
[430.20] You guys have no idea what he is.
[438.00] How do you feel now?
[440.20] A lot better.
[449.16] Thank God
[451.08] that you weren’t hurt much.
[453.28] But what happened?
[462.64] I don’t know,
[464.64] I gave my clothes for ironing to Pirah,
[473.84] she didn’t do it so 
I started to do it myself,
[485.96] as soon as I inserted the plug,
[487.64] there was a spark and
[492.32] then I don’t remember anything after that.
[504.52] God has been kind.
[506.68] I have given charity in your name.
[513.64] What was the need for
you to start ironing yourself?
[515.68] There are so many servants at home,
[516.96] you could have asked anyone.
[523.84] I am fine.
[529.64] Yes, Sir, did you call me?
[531.76] How did all this happen?
[533.44] I don’t know, Sir.
[541.32] When Madam Jr. 
asked you to iron her clothes
[543.88] then where did you disappear?
[552.36] Madam Mizna stopped me.
[562.16] I was just coming to iron 
the clothes after comforting her.
[565.80] Such carelessness, Pirah?
[573.12] What if something had
 happened to Madam Jr?
[582.60] For Madam Jr, I can sacrifice
 my parents, Madam,
[587.00] but what did I know that 
she will start ironing herself?
[595.32] Didn’t you even know the wire is sparking
[601.36] and it can harm someone?
[611.72] Sir, had I known,
[613.72] wouldn’t I bring another iron?
[615.52] After all, I was the one
 who was supposed to iron.
[622.32] Then I would have been 
lying unconscious instead of Madam.
[628.08] Now, don’t talk so much,
[630.40] go away from here,
[631.44] and be careful next time.
[633.24] Okay.
[636.52] You take rest, my child, yeah?
[638.04] Okay.
[640.80] Take care of her.
[641.68] Okay.
[655.40] Fiza, you must make 
the younger one understand.
[658.28] Why?
[659.04] Our Sania is so sensible,
[660.80] what is the need to make her understand?
[662.44] She is not sensible at all.
[665.04] She keeps on saying weird things.
[669.44] What is the matter?
[671.12] Ever since your sister-in-law 
Sumbul got her wedding done,
[676.08] I and your dad have also planned
[679.32] to look for a nice match for Sania
[681.08] and get her wedding done as well
[690.20] and then we will send her off in a year or so.
[698.16] That’s a nice thought,
[700.24] and the time that you have
 thought of is appropriate as well.
[706.96] Is there any suitable or nice match
 that you may have found?
[711.56] Hey, a suitable and nice match will 
only be found when we will try finding it,
[715.16] Hun,
and before even trying to find it,
[717.24] Miss Sania has put 
a time bomb on our heads.
[727.16] Why?
[728.24] What happened, Sania? Yeah?
[733.52] Miss Sania says
[735.20] that she will only marry when she finds someone
 as rich and loving as Brother Ghaznavi.
[744.12] Really, Sania?
[745.64] Did you actually say that
 or Mom is just saying?
[747.68] Hmm,
[749.24] Yes, you are right!
[750.92] Mom, by the way, I think, 
Sania is absolutely right.
[754.40] Oh,
[755.52] so you have started to talk like her as well?
[757.68] Hmm,
[758.48] That is the reality,
[760.60] every girl wants a rich and loving husband.
[769.88] Not everyone gets everything.
[777.60] Dua was the fortunate one to get everything.
[784.20] Yes, you are right,
[786.56] it’s Dua’s good luck
[793.76] but you know,
[795.48] we can still compromise on money
[798.96] but how can a woman spend such 
a long journey without love?
[811.48] And I think my Sania is not 
demanding anything wrong.
[817.44] We will look for a very
 nice match for Sania
[820.56] where no matter if the guy is not very rich,
[823.48] but at least rich enough to fulfill
 all the wishes of my sister,
[828.84] she doesn’t have to crave anything
[831.48] and who loves her
[833.96] and always keeps her happy.
[837.60] I will go serve the food.
[839.08] Oh, so you are blushing?
[867.72] So, this was all attempted by you?
[869.56] Yes,
[871.48] it was an attempt by me
[876.20] but see you are saved.
[881.12] When you know I am so fortunate
[885.16] then why do you make such attempts?
[891.12] You won’t survive every time.
[894.88] I won’t miss the target next time,
[897.36] I will kill you at any cost.
[899.92] I am surprised,
[903.12] how are you alive with 
so much poison in you?
[906.32] I won’t die, Dua,
[911.84] I won’t die before killing you.
[919.08] Miss Kashmala, everyone 
loves you a lot in this house,
[923.96] they take so much care of you
 but you are…
[926.08] Only you,
[931.40] I don’t have a problem with anyone else,
[936.88] I just have a problem with you
[941.48] and this hatred will also end if you
 get out of Nosherwan’s life.
[965.56] This wish of yours cannot be fulfilled,
[972.32] sorry.
[989.12] I very well know how to 
fulfill every wish of mine.
[999.84] Fiza,
[1002.88] does Sarfaraz not love you?
[1007.60] I don’t know, Mom.
[1010.08] That’s amazing,
[1011.80] you are his wife, if you 
don’t know then who knows
[1014.52] if your husband loves you or not?
[1018.08] Sarfaraz’s anger takes over everything,
[1021.92] I am unable to find out if he loves me or not.
[1035.00] Parents can only judge the decency of the boy’s
 family before getting their daughters married.
[1046.56] A mother cannot see
[1049.84] if her daughter will get 
love from there or not.
[1054.96] Mom, you know what?
[1057.52] I was thinking we would let
 Sania marry by her choice.
[1061.28] We will find a boy who loves her a lot.
[1065.56] Look, Dua is also very happy because
[1068.96] Brother Ghaznavi loves her a lot.
[1073.52] Maybe.
[1076.44] Oh, Dua reminded me of,
[1078.48] where is she?
[1079.52] It has been so many days 
that I didn’t meet her.
[1081.08] Didn’t she even come to your house?
[1082.96] No, she did come, we met and talked.
[1087.16] She has gone to the mansion these days,
[1090.00] Ghaznavi’s father is not well
[1092.36] so they have gone there to see him.
[1094.88] Umm,
[1096.20] I will go help Sania with food,
[1097.80] I am very hungry, 
and I will quickly get it served.
[1109.40] Am I not watching both 
my sisters living their lives?
[1113.32] Brother Sarfaraz does 
not value Sister at all.
[1118.36] He doesn’t have money,
[1120.40] but the arrogance,
[1121.92] it never ends,
[1127.96] whereas,
[1129.20] look at Brother Nosherwan,
[1131.40] he is also rich and he loves Sister crazily.
[1138.04] My child, it’s all about fate.
[1143.28] Dua had all of this in her fate.
[1145.52] If that’s how it is, then Mom,
[1146.68] I pray that my fate is not like Sister Fiza
[1150.16] but Sister Dua instead.
[1208.96] Shall we leave?
[1210.84] Go safely.
[1214.44] Next time come for longer.
[1218.32] Now you all should come to Karachi.
[1224.72] Stay blessed.
[1226.28] Bye.
[1226.68] Bye.
[1230.12] Stay happy and go safely, my child.
[1231.64] Bye.
[1232.28] Bye.
[1239.68] I am Nosherwan’s first wife.
[1242.48] What difference does it make
 who is first and who is second?
[1249.68] What makes a difference is,
[1252.32] who has Ghaznavi given this rank to?
[1293.84] Hey, Khizar, son,
[1295.84] why are you standing outside? Come inside.
[1299.68] Sarfaraz, give him way.
[1309.68] Greetings, uncle.
[1310.40] Greetings, come, son, come, sit.
[1324.52] Sarfaraz, go inside and inform your mom that
[1327.16] Khizar is here and also ask her to make tea.
[1332.48] Mom?
[1336.24] Mom?
[1337.32] Hey, what happened?
[1338.84] Why are you calling me?
[1340.56] Your brilliant son-in-law is here.
[1344.56] Hey, Khizar?
[1345.48] Greetings, Aunt
[1346.64] Greetings, son,
[1348.52] how are you?
[1350.04] Sit.
[1357.88] Khizar, thank you so much, son,
[1361.32] that you came here because I called you.
[1379.96] I wanted to talk to you about something.
[1382.40] Whatever happened the other
 day shouldn’t have happened.
[1398.44] My child, I don’t want to get 
into an argument about
[1400.48] whether it was your mistake or Sarfaraz’s,
[1412.72] but there is a need for both 
of you to understand that
[1417.12] Sumbul’s relationship with 
both of you won’t be broken.
[1429.80] Now if both of you don’t 
clear your misunderstandings,
[1435.00] Sumbul would be the 
most affected by this fight.
[1449.88] Uncle, I admit that
[1451.76] Sumbul is a sister and 
a daughter in this home
[1455.40] but she has been tied in 
a new relationship now.
[1462.52] She is your daughter
[1464.92] and your sister,
[1467.76] and now she is my wife too.
[1478.52] Uncle, I have no doubts about the fact
[1479.68] that you guys love Sumbul a lot,
[1481.92] I am sure you do and you should
[1485.92] but no one has the right to insult me
[1489.52] or jeopardize my honor.
[1502.00] The other day Sarfaraz insulted me a lot,
[1504.80] I took it that day.
[1512.28] Uncle, I will tell you a small thing,
[1516.84] do I not have a right on my wife
[1520.44] to take her out to a restaurant to have food,
[1523.00] do I not have that right?
[1529.16] You are right, son,
[1530.60] I am sure you have a right on
 Sumbul after the wedding
[1536.20] but people don’t like it when you 
hang out without marrying her off,
[1545.80] it becomes an eyesore for them and
[1548.48] people also raise their fingers.
[1557.00] But still, I admit I did allow 
you to take her out,
[1562.04] but in this matter, after allowing you,
[1564.80] I thought and
[1566.64] I also wanted to talk to
 you again regarding this.
[1569.76] My child, I think
[1572.28] I might not be able to allow you again.
[1576.20] Uncle, I had no such intentions
[1579.40] to take Sumbul out again and again.
[1586.56] And I won’t be able to bear it 
if anyone raises a finger at Sumbul.
[1591.44] I will be careful next time, Uncle.
[1593.32] Our son-in-law is very sensible.
[1607.68] Still, I expected such sensibility from you.
[1632.32] You made the tea already?
[1633.60] Yes, I did.
[1636.40] I thought I would make tea by 
my own hands for Khizar today.
[1640.96] Hey,
[1642.12] you could have told me earlier.
[1644.08] You could have also asked me first.
[1653.44] If I knew you had such plans,
[1656.16] I wouldn’t have made it.
[1657.44] Hey, Fiza?
[1659.00] Yes, I am bringing it.
[1663.56] Give me a chance to score some points 
in front of my husband as well.
[1692.80] Enough now, how much will you work?
[1694.56] You will get tired.
[1697.28] Here, anything else?
[1700.76] Hey, such obedience?
[1704.24] You just try saying it once,
[1706.16] I will also give my life for you this quickly.
[1711.04] I don’t need your life,
[1713.00] I need your companionship forever.
[1719.56] That is there forever.
[1725.56] Okay, tell me,
[1727.00] did you get any call from the mansion?
[1731.88] Did you talk to anyone?
[1733.72] How is Baba Saeein now?
[1735.96] Yes, I just spoke to them a while ago,
[1738.04] he is well now.
[1741.60] I spoke to Amma Saeein, as well.
[1744.88] Hmm,
[1746.88] by the way, I felt you would be a little disturbed 
after coming back from the mansion
[1750.80] but thank God that didn’t happen.
[1753.24] Disturbed, why?
[1755.84] Because of the same iron incident.
[1760.64] It was meant to happen and it did.
[1772.36] I don’t know why I feel 
someone did that on purpose.
[1780.24] I don’t think so.
[1784.08] I suspect Kashmala.
[1790.40] You won’t survive every time.
[1792.08] I won’t miss the target next time,
[1794.76] I will kill you at any cost.
[1797.24] I am surprised,
[1800.36] how are you alive with 
so much poison in you?
[1803.56] I won’t die, Dua,
[1807.04] I won’t die before killing you.
[1815.48] Maybe, had I been a little strict with Pirah,
[1818.20] she would have taken the name.
[1825.72] It’s not that
[1830.92] but let’s suppose,
[1835.40] if Kashmala’s name had been taken,
[1839.24] what would you do then?
[1851.20] I would behave harshly with her.
[1855.12] Harshly?
[1857.60] No, no,
[1859.68] I already feel pity for her and
[1862.24] you would have been even harsher with her.
[1867.44] You feel pity and that too on Kashmala?
[1870.08] You are feeling pity for a woman
[1871.56] who would kill you if she ever gets a chance.
[1881.08] Let her,
[1883.24] life and death are in the hands of God
[1886.44] and I wouldn’t die before it’s my time.
[1890.44] By the way, you are quite different 
from the rest of the women.
[1897.72] I mean,
[1899.56] when you talk about a second 
wife in front of a woman,
[1901.68] she often starts trash-talking,
[1904.72] and you are taking her side.
[1907.44] The grief of one-sided love is very deep,
[1918.88] she loves you a lot.
[1927.84] Whenever she looks at you,
[1929.60] I feel like her heart is crying.
[1938.28] So, what do you want?
[1940.48] Should I also start looking towards her?
[1947.16] Would you be able to bear that?
[1949.64] No.
[1952.32] If you can’t then don’t say 
such things that will hurt you.
[1958.96] One day,
[1960.88] Kashmala will realize 
that she wasted her time.
[1967.64] And she might also marry someone else,
[1970.76] that is what I think.
[1976.36] Hmm.
[1984.88] What are you thinking?
[1988.16] That you really enjoy teasing me.
[1993.20] You have given me a chance yourself.
