Yes, greetings Baba Saeein. Where is Nosherwan? He is right here, in front of me. Why is he not answering my phone? Yes, phone? Let me talk to him.
Yes. I will just put him through. Yes. Sir Jr, Baba Saeein wants to talk to you. Greetings Baba Saeein. Nosherwan, where are you right now? I have come somewhere 
for something important. Is everything okay? You leave for the mansion, right now. Come and meet me. At this hour? Did you not hear what I said? No, I heard it, but, can I visit sometime tomorrow? Is something special keeping you busy? I have to do something special today. Has your special work become 
greater than my order? What does Baba Saeein want me to do? Sure, I will come. I am waiting. Come immediately. Jaffar. Yes. The work will be done, sir. Saeein, I came as soon as I got your message. Is everything okay? The thing was such that
I had to call you. You too try that Kashmala 
doesn’t find out about this. What has happened that 
you are putting so many restrictions? Why do you seem so worried? Have a seat. I am worried, that’s why I look worried. May God have mercy. I have never seen you so worried 
about really big things. What has happened? I am really worried 
because of Nosherwan. But, why? He is our sensible son. This is what I am disappointed about, that I didn’t expect anything 
like this from him. What has happened, Saeein, that you are so mistrustful of him? Nosherwan has started visiting 
Zunaira’s bungalow, and Zunaira doesn’t have 
a good reputation. Nosherwan is really patient, he has never had such interests. This is the thing that has worried me. You call him to the mansion. Call him immediately and 
ask him yourself. I have called him. He is coming. That is why I have called you here so that I can take you into confidence. Please listen to whatever is said
 in front of him with great patience, and provide any arguments 
you have for resolving the issue. It is possible that I will be 
strict with Nosherwan, you don’t take it to your heart. Saeein, what has happened that you are mentally preparing me for? Maybe something big will happen, but before I bring it to my tongue, I want to hear the truth from Nosherwan. Whatever your decision will be, I stand with you. Just keep one thing in mind. Our son is already very heartbroken, and feeling desolate. After Zawar's death, the sacrifice 
we demanded from him has left me incapable of 
looking him in the eyes. He is unaware that 
we shattered his love. Seeing his sadness causes us great distress. This is the only thought that stops me from being 
strict with Nosherwan. Even after going through 
such a hard time, his steps didn’t falter, so now... Pray. Pray that whatever my ears have 
heard is completely wrong, and Nosherwan comes and 
proves us wrong. That is what will happen. Did he say till what time he will reach? He must have left by now. I will get some arrangements made for food. Okay. Fauzia’s committee is here, and Shehla is left. I will have to call her. Are you awake? 
Have you gotten up? Yes, I am awake. Look, how long will I lie to your father? At least get a job. Mama, you are saying it like someone is going after me 
with a job on a platter and I am not taking it. I have given my CV,
if they want to call me, they will. The thirsty person goes to the well himself. Get out there and search for a job. 
That’s how you will find it. I don’t want to hear your lectures 
early in the morning. Tell someone to bring breakfast for me. Early in the morning? It is 2:30 pm. And how will I make breakfast right now? I will ask Sumbul, 
she will make breakfast for you. Okay, and where is she… the one you have happily brought 
to enforce on my head? Where is she? 
Ask her to make it. When is she at home? 
She still hasn’t come home. What do you mean she still hasn’t come?
It is 2:30 pm. I don’t know. When she comes, 
you can talk to her yourself. There. Greetings. Greetings. Where were you? You get off at 1:15 pm. 
Have you seen the time? It was the first day, I didn’t know much about the buses. I couldn’t find a space, 
all the buses were full. Then, I had to take a rickshaw 
and come home. I got a little late. Here we go, she is making excuses right 
from the first day. Madam, the bus driver will not wait 
for you with an empty bus. You have to make your 
own space in the buses. Look, this has happened today, but if this happens in the future 
then you will see the worst in me. Go, make breakfast for me. You still haven’t had breakfast? No, he was waiting for your 
cross-questioning. Yes, I will just bring it. 
Go. Mama, I swear, 
I feel annoyed looking at her. Your father is extremely 
affectionate towards her. He says, I have a really modest 
and respectful, daughter-in-law. But, I know, she is really cunning 
on the inside. Look at her sister, Dua. Is it necessary to take her name? Huh? You spoiled my mood. Hey, what did I do? 
I just took her name. I don’t know what happened to this boy. What is the meaning of 
what Baba Saeein said? What is the matter, for which 
he has been called urgently? Is something going to happen? I will talk to him as soon as they arrive. No, I won't be able to wait that long. Dua, your phone is ringing. He didn’t answer my phone. Your poor phone went quiet 
after ringing for a long time. My phone? Okay. Meaning, you forgot your phone. Do you remember what 
Nosherwan said to Zunaira? This number shouldn’t be off. If I get a call now, then I will talk. Check, he must be calling. It is an unknown number. Then, you call your lover. He will call back himself. If he doesn’t call himself, then you call him. What if, your hero hangs us all on the gallows
as punishment for you not calling him? You speak so much nonsense. This dress? Why did you take this out? Are you going somewhere? Great. You are getting married in the evening and you are asking me 
why I picked this dress. I will wear this when you say ‘I accept’, ‘I accept’, ‘I accept’, 
in the evening. Okay, there is no need to make 
that sad face and miss your family. When they have forgotten you, then you too learn 
to live without them, okay? Answer it, what if he gets upset? Do one thing,
 you talk comfortably, I will come. Hello. Hello. Nosherwan? No, Nosherwan is not there. Who are you? and what is Nosherwan’s phone 
doing with you? Yes, I… I am asking you something, 
who are you? Answer me. I… Madam is calling you immediately. You go ahead, I am coming. Hello. Hello. She cut my call. Who is this girl? Come, Dua. See, your hero has sent such 
a beautiful bridal dress. Not just the dress, matching jewelry, bangles, heels. You have hit the jackpot. I had brought you thinking that 
this moon would descend in my courtyard, but you had already come here thinking 
about spreading light in another courtyard. He seems like your true lover. We will see if this love even suits you or not. Be careful. When she cannot do anything, the poor thing will only burst 
the blister on her burning heart. Ignore her. Look, how pretty these things are. Come on, come here. Wow, honestly Dua, I envy your fate. You found such a good life partner. Brother Aslam. Brother Aslam. Where are you going, buddy? Where are you nowadays? I don’t see you in the neighborhood, brother. I am really busy nowadays. Hey, brother, everyone knows you people have been forced 
to go into hiding after that accident. You know, after Dua, now people have started 
talking about Fiza. Why? What happened to Fiza? She is really happy at her in-laws home. In-laws home? Buddy, either you are unaware or you are acting like 
you don’t know anything. You openly say what you want to say. Buddy, she has started a job. Right now, even the color of henna 
hasn’t even been removed from her hands. Where did you get her married? Fiza has left the school. Buddy, you are completely unaware. Take care of your daughter, 
what are they doing? How are they? You too take care of your legs. I will break them someday. Brother, I am saying it for your betterment. I will slap you hard. 
Get lost from here. They come over and 
say what they want to. Should I give you something to eat? 
You didn’t even have breakfast properly. I am not hungry. Please, eat something. Okay. Meaning, now I will eat 
and drink by your will. When did I say that? I was just saying that 
if you eat on time, then you stay healthy, that’s it. Look, Fiza, I am not a child. I know well how to take care of my health. Fine. I wanted to ask you, will you also buy me a mobile phone? Okay. Why? Who do you want to talk to secretly? What are you saying? I too am thinking the same, 
why do you suddenly need to get a phone? Nowadays, the phone is the biggest need, and that is why everyone has it. Hmmm. But you didn’t have it earlier. Papa had an issue with the phone, 
but now I am here. So what if you are here? I don’t understand you. You, please, say 
what you want to say, clearly. Look, the clear thing is that when your father didn’t trust you when he didn’t trust your sister, 
then why should I? But I am your wife. Papa couldn’t understand his daughters, but you can understand me, right? And then, now, 
I am a school teacher, I do a job. 
I have to contact my colleague, and you know you have to research 
online for the lesson plan… Okay. Okay. Enough. No need to tell me the benefits 
of having a phone. And even if all the women 
in the world have phones, you shouldn’t have one. And you know the reason for it well. You have a sister named Dua and you are well aware of her actions. She used to talk to boys on the phone, 
secretly, did you see the result of that? She ran away. Dua was not like that. Let me meet her once, 
I will ask her myself… Don’t you dare, Fiza. You don’t even have to think 
about meeting her, do you understand? If you try to talk to her, then I will divorce you on the spot. I will make you forbidden for me. What does she think of herself? She wants to meet her. Such a big thing happened at home and you kept me unaware. I found out in the morning 
when I saw Fiza outside the school. Okay. So, your daughters have 
become so independent that they don't even bother to inform you. Fiza is not like that. She must not have had 
the chance to tell me. How did she not get the chance? Why didn’t she tell you that 
she is joining the school? God knows what the reason will be,
 I will ask her. Fehmida, this conspiracy of your daughters 
to ruin my honor ends today. Call her. Call her. Call her in-laws. Okay, let me talk to Fiza first. They will consider it bad to call her
 and ask her to come. They can mind it 
as much as they want. I don’t care about anyone. 
Call her. Call her. Cool down. We can also talk about this patiently. Fehmida, your daughters 
are playing with my honor, and you're telling me to stay calm? Call them. I have never seen such a beautiful bride. What is this? There is no henna? These hands just lack henna. One second. 
Rumi. So madam, I even have a readymade 
solution for this too. Rumi. No, Rumi. A bride with empty hands 
doesn’t look good. What happened, Brother Aslam? You called us here in such an emergency. You are making our daughter 
work in the school, and we cannot even call you 
in an emergency? Mr. Aslam, talk calmly, we are the parents of the girl. Yes, so what? 
We are the parents of the girl. What do we do? Should we turn our existence 
into a doormat? So, that whoever comes can wipe 
their shoes and goes. What are you saying, Brother Aslam? Why would we make Fiza do a job? Is it not true that Fiza has 
joined the school again? Yes, it is true, but… You let me talk. What hell broke loose 
if your daughter joined the school? Huh? She used to do a job earlier as well. Did you scream like this earlier too? That was different. What was different?
Mama, one minute. Firstly, you tell me, 
why are you screaming? Sarfaraz, son, I am talking. No, papa. Let me talk to him today. She was doing a job before marriage,
and taking care of your expenses, then there was no issue. But, today, when she is doing 
the same job again, you are calling us here 
and humiliating us. Sarfaraz, son, it is a matter of the home, so let’s talk calmly among ourselves. Yes, you don’t make me understand this,
make him understand. Because I know, he can scream and 
shout and make you agree to what he says. But this will not work with us. Be quiet, Sarfaraz. Why should he be quiet?
Let him talk. He is right. One daughter ran away 
on the day of the wedding, we married and took away the other one. Instead of accepting our favor, he got upset with us. Before calling and humiliating us, you should have asked your daughter if we had put a gun to her head,
to go and do a job. Why are you standing there cunningly? Why don’t you tell your father? What will she say? She and her family have taken up 
the responsibility to humiliate us. Hey, speak up. 
Why don’t you say something? Yes. Yes, papa, I am doing this job by my will. Did you hear that? Your daughters are really broad-minded. One daughter ran away from home, and the other daughter didn’t 
want to stay at home. She doesn’t like it at home. And instead, you are humiliating us. Wow, just wow. Hey, listen, end this discussion now. Huh. End it. Papa is right. We should end this discussion 
and this relationship. Hey, Sarfaraz…. Greetings Amma. How are you Baba Saeein? We have called you here to 
ask about your well-being. Sit down. Dua, you are so lucky. I wish, we too had found 
someone like this. Hey, stop it, you people. Don’t put an evil eye on Dua’s happiness. The cleric is here. 
Should I call him? Yes, yes, the cleric is here, call him. The cleric is here, but till now, the mister is not here, who was madly in love. Now, it would be good if he also came. By now, you must have a good idea why you have been called here so suddenly. If you explain, it will be easier for me. After all that you've been doing behind 
our backs, thinking we're ignorant, you still need an explanation. It's astonishing. I don’t understand. Do you still need an explanation after frequently
 visiting the home of a woman like Zunaira? Did you people call me here 
to ask me about this? I wanted an answer from you. Why? You never had such interests. Before tarnishing your 
Amma Saeein's upbringing, didn't you even consider how embarrassed she'll be 
once she finds out? I haven't done any such thing, Baba Saeein, that would cause embarrassment 
to Amma Saeein's upbringing or make you hesitant 
to give me your name. Then what is the need to 
visit Zunaira’s bungalow? Tell us clearly, we have found out everything. 
There is no need to hide anything. I just want to hear from you. I am getting married to Dua. Nosherwan. Maybe you are forgetting, that Kashmala is married to you. She is present in this mansion as your wife. This is something I am unable to forget. Nosherwan, what is this I hear? You heard right, Amma. Kashmala is our family's daughter-in-law. Did you find that dirty girl in comparison
to her to connect with our family? An accident made her reach there, 
or else I know her. She belongs to a decent 
and respectable family. A rose only looks beautiful till 
the time it doesn’t fall in the mud. Forget her, and look at the one 
who is waiting for you here. I will not be able to do what you want. Kashmala is the same for me
as she was earlier. I have surely married her, but I will not be able to 
embarrass my brother’s soul. I will never be able to do it. Hey, he is dead. Now Kashmala and her children 
are your responsibility. I am not running away from any 
responsibility of mine, Baba Saeein. I know they are my responsibility. You wanted me to get married to her, I did. You wanted the children and 
Kashmala to stay in this mansion, and I complied with your order.
 But even today... Baba Saeein, 
if Kashmala asks me even today, I won't hesitate for a second to let her go. She has every right 
to live her life as she wishes. Do you hear that? What are you saying Nosherwan? I am absolutely right, Amma Saeein. Brother died, but not Kashmala’s feelings. If that day you people hadn’t insisted 
that Kashmala must stay in this mansion, then it’s possible Kashmala would 
have chosen someone for herself who keeps her happy. Why someone else? Why can you not keep her happy? Because I don’t love her. I have given my word to accept Dua. That dirty girl…
Baba Saeein, I have decided to make Dua my respect. So, it would be better that you too don’t use
any such word for your to-be daughter-in-law, which may make you incapable 
of looking her in the eyes later. Hurry up, I also have to go to conduct 
weddings at other places too. Hey cleric, the groom has been missing till now, 
then how can we hurry up? Dua, you call Nosherwan. One minute, I will call him. Fantastic. Bravo. Fantastic. Hey, such cunning can only be 
expected from someone like Ghaznavi, that if you set out to find him, you will end up pulling your hair out. Wow, impressive! Did you see?
