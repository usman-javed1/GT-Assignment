[38.12] Where are you going?
[39.76] Come we will drop you. 
Come on.
[43.44] What are you thinking?
[46.64] Come on. Come on.
 Where are you going?
[48.68] Wait. Listen to me.
[51.04] Hey, why are you worried?
[53.44] Come on, we are good people.
[55.96] Come.
[65.16] Hey, what happened? 
Come on.
[67.24] Come, sit.
[68.88] I think these boys are bothering her. 
Go, save her.
[71.04] Come on. Come with us. 
Sit in the car.
[74.12] Come on.
[75.96] What?
[78.12] Move back.
[93.40] Please, save me.
[94.92] Those boys…
Yes. Yes. Yes.
[98.24] They ran because of the gunshot.
[99.84] They will come again. 
Please, save me. Please.
[102.28] Relax.
[103.32] Till we are with you, 
no one will say anything to you.
[107.80] Anyway, don’t worry.
[109.80] Tell me what were you doing here, 
so late at night, in this condition?
[115.36] And who were those two?
[117.28] I don’t know.
[118.76] I know nothing. 
I was there,
[121.64] they had come after me.
[123.60] I didn’t know who they were.
I don’t…
[126.04] Okay, fine. 
Don’t worry.
[129.04] Where is your home? 
Come, we will drop you.
[132.16] My….my home.
[134.40] Yes, your home.
[139.12] I don’t have a home.
[143.20] You don’t have a home?
[145.64] No problem.
[147.84] You come and stay at my home.
[151.64] No, I will go.
[154.24] I will go somewhere. I…
[156.92] Where will you go 
on this dark night?
[159.36] If you go around like this 
on secluded streets alone,
[161.76] then such cheap boys will run after you.
[163.92] How long will you save 
yourself from them?
[166.20] Come with me.
[171.56] Why are you crying?
[173.76] Hey, cowards cry,
[176.20] and you look really brave to me. Hmm?
[180.68] You come to my home with me.
[184.40] There is no one other than me 
and my daughters at my home.
[187.48] You don’t leave me and go.
[190.84] You stay here. 
That’s why I am saying,
[193.28] you come to my home.
[195.16] I am sure you will live comfortably there.
[201.64] Child, I have to go.
[205.68] My daughters are waiting 
for me at my home.
[208.96] If you don’t want to go with me, 
then no issue.
[213.64] I will not force you.
[215.92] But, reach a safe location
 as soon as possible.
[221.12] I will be worried for you.
[226.84] Okay,
[228.00] how long can I stand here with you?
[234.60] You are really beautiful, 
extremely good-looking,
[239.84] and wolves come out on the streets
like this in the dark of the night.
[244.32] Okay?
[244.96] Take care of yourself.
Come on, Hasan.
[250.08] No, please,
[252.08] I will go with you to your home.
[256.80] Thank God.
[258.28] At least this sensible decision of 
yours saved me from ruining my sleep.
[264.20] Come on, come.
[278.24] Sit.
[373.16] Fehmida Begum,
[375.20] she didn’t die.
[377.44] She ruined our respect and left.
[380.48] Now, whose funeral are you mourning?
[384.12] For God’s sake, Mr. Aslam,
[388.28] don’t say such hurtful words.
[393.36] A girl who has never 
stayed out of the house,
[396.36] who has never spent 
a night away from home,
[398.40] where all could she be wandering?
[400.64] I'm fed up with listening to your talks.
[404.08] Girls who don't respect their parents,
[408.84] this is what happens to them.
[410.56] Please, have some consideration.
[413.08] She's a young girl.
[414.88] Who knows where she might be?
[416.88] Did she consider her father’s respect?
[419.48] Hey, she can die or go anywhere,
[421.48] I don’t care.
[422.76] For God’s sake, Mr. Aslam,
[425.16] have some mercy.
[426.56] Have some mercy on my motherhood.
[429.68] Hey, for God’s sake, find my daughter 
and bring her home.
[433.76] Hey, you are talking 
about her entry into this home.
[437.32] I won’t even let her funeral 
come into this home.
[440.32] Fehmida,
[441.88] if you take that girl’s name
[444.04] then you will see the worst in me.
[446.04] If you want to cry for her, then go.
[448.84] Go out of the room. 
Go out and cry for her.
[487.20] Hey, come. Come. 
Don’t be scared.
[491.52] Come inside.
[495.92] This is my humble abode,
[498.60] and my daughters live 
with me in this home.
[504.24] And you too are like them for me. Okay?
[511.72] Hello, Mama. 
Hello, child.
[514.68] Hello, Mama.
[515.68] Hello, child. Did you people have food?
[517.40] Yes, we were waiting for you, 
we just ate a little while back.
[521.08] Okay, good.
[523.44] How was your party?
[525.28] Yes, it was so good.
[528.32] Who is this that you brought with you?
[530.92] Hey,
[532.20] I haven't even asked you for your name.
[534.76] What is your name?
[537.80] Dua.
[539.60] Dua?
[541.16] It is a really pretty name.
[543.80] This is Dua,
[545.28] and I met her on the way.
[549.08] Some goon was bothering her.
[552.40] Coincidentally, she came 
in front of our car,
[554.28] so I didn’t find it reasonable 
to leave her on the way,
[557.96] so I brought her along with me.
[559.24] So, today, Dua is our guest, 
and tomorrow morning
[562.52] she can go wherever she wants.
[568.32] Did you eat food?
[570.56] Hey,
[571.72] how will she eat?
[573.56] Does someone serve food on the street?
[576.48] Okay, listen, Roomi.
[577.92] Child, ask the servant to serve 
food for Dua, quickly.
[582.40] I will ask them.
[609.80] Have it, child.
[612.04] Start eating.
[633.92] Hey, child.
[636.40] Eat it. Here you go.
[664.40] By the way, the girl is really pretty.
[667.32] How did you trap her?
[670.24] You know, what they say is right.
[671.80] Girls lost in love and romance 
end up nowhere.
[676.56] Now what would she know how big 
of a price you took for her?
[681.28] Okay yes, this is her glass, don’t forget.
[696.12] I feel dizzy.
[698.56] I have to go home.
[719.12] When I am with you,
[721.60] then you never have to worry.
[762.64] Dua.
[764.44] Child, your clothes look very dirty.
[770.04] Roomi,
[771.96] you give her your clothes.
[774.32] Child,
[775.80] you shower and change them.
[778.12] No need for the formality, 
I am fine.
[780.80] Hey, child, what is the formality in this?
[783.92] Roomi is my daughter, and you too 
are like my daughter.
[789.04] I won’t ask you what you were doing 
on the streets so late at night
[795.76] nor will I pressurize you
[797.84] that you tell me anything 
about your family.
[802.92] But, I do understand
[806.00] that you are really worried
[811.72] and if you ever feel like resting 
your head on someone's shoulder
[815.72] and crying to lighten your heart,
[821.00] my shoulder is here for you.
[825.72] Child,
[827.28] if not as your mother, you can at least 
consider me like your mother.
[832.56] Thank you.
[834.48] Roomi,
[836.00] you take Dua to your room.
[837.64] She will stay in your room, tonight.
[841.16] Child, the driver will drop you 
where you want in the morning.
[845.04] And yes,
[846.96] Dua shouldn’t suffer from anything.
[850.44] You said it, it won’t happen.
[859.80] Come on, child. Now you rest.
[862.96] You seem to be awake for a lot of hours.
[866.32] Okay?
[873.20] Shall we go?
[896.12] Hey,
[897.16] why did you stop? Come inside.
[903.84] This…
[907.72] Is this your room?
[909.88] Yes,
[911.08] and from today, it is yours as well.
[912.80] After all, you will share the room with me,
[914.44] so it belongs to you too.
[918.24] Hmmm.
[919.00] Mama has a really good heart.
[921.00] If you have any problem,
[922.76] then you can share it with her.
[924.88] In fact, if you want to stay here forever,
[928.28] then she will even accept this
[929.72] and get a room even more beautiful 
than this compared to this.
[938.48] Your Mama is really very good.
[943.76] Had I not come in front of her car,
[948.52] God knows what would have 
happened with me, today.
[951.04] Now you have come here, right?
[952.68] So you don’t have to be scared 
of anyone with Mama there.
[958.64] I will come in a minute.
[979.16] Here you go.
[980.84] Go and change and fix yourself.
[983.20] No,
[984.60] how can I take this?
[987.36] What are you saying? 
Here, go and change.
[995.40] The washroom is on the
 right side over here.
[997.96] I will take this call.
[1000.16] Hello.
[1001.88] Yes, hi.
[1065.32] Oh wow,
[1066.88] you look really good in these clothes.
[1071.76] Why are you crying?
[1076.68] I was missing my family.
[1081.52] Look, you can discuss whatever 
your problem is with me.
[1085.40] Now, we are friends, right?
[1091.68] Okay,
[1092.84] if not me, then at least discuss it with Mama.
[1096.64] She will solve all your problems.
[1099.24] Take your time. Okay?
[1110.12] You rest,
[1111.40] I will go say goodnight to Mama.
[1115.68] Okay?
[1148.76] God has been really kind,
[1151.52] my son’s life has been saved.
[1155.56] Now, we will do charity 
after going to the mansion,
[1158.52] so that every trouble always 
stays away from you.
[1163.48] Take care of yourself, son.
[1166.04] You people are leaving really soon.
[1169.16] We don’t want to leave you and go,
[1172.44] but the children are alone in the mansion.
[1174.28] They must be getting worried.
[1175.92] No, so I will have the children called here.
[1178.72] No son,
[1180.20] it will disturb their school.
[1182.72] And after all,
[1184.32] we are leaving Kashmala with you,
[1187.68] to take care of you.
[1195.00] No, there is no need for that.
[1196.96] Jaffar is here to take care of you.
[1200.20] Idiot.
[1201.60] A wife is a wife.
[1204.28] And no one can care for you 
more than a wife.
[1207.52] But the children need their mother,
[1209.92] so this is also not right.
[1211.64] The children are really attached to me
and your Baba Saeein.
[1216.24] Don’t worry.
[1217.36] They will be really happy with us.
[1218.84] Mama, I am telling you,
[1220.80] there are other servants too, 
to take care of me, so…
[1222.92] Don’t argue so much, son.
[1226.32] Your Amma Saeein is leaving 
Kashmala for your betterment.
[1231.60] When Kasmala stays here,
[1233.84] then we too will find solace from your side.
[1240.40] Sure.
[1242.36] We should leave.
[1244.24] Kashmala. 
Yes, Amma Saeein.
[1246.52] You have to take a lot of care 
of our Nosherwan,
[1249.80] there should be no mistake.
[1252.16] You don’t worry, Amma Saeein.
[1255.08] He is the king of my head.
[1258.72] I will take care of him.
[1260.52] You won't hear a complaint.
[1263.40] We will go.
[1265.04] Take lots of care of yourself too. 
Yes.
[1268.68] Live long.
[1273.24] Okay son, goodbye.
[1276.20] Come. 
Come.
[1355.40] I wanted to say something to you.
[1357.44] Go ahead.
[1360.84] No one has come from my home,
[1363.00] and I can't go there right now.
[1367.04] So?
[1369.56] If you would have let me talk to 
my family with your phone…
[1375.24] What do you want to talk about?
[1377.76] I just wanted to know if everything is fine.
[1380.76] Everyone would be worried for Dua,
[1382.84] so I thought I would ask if they found out 
something about her or not.
[1386.08] Okay.
[1388.32] So, you feel that you will find out 
about your sister,
[1391.72] and the one who ran away from home, 
she will come back?
[1398.36] I just wanted to know 
the condition of the home.
[1402.36] No need to talk to anyone about anything.
[1406.32] Talk at the reception in the evening.
[1411.40] After all,
[1414.60] I am thinking I will talk to Mama and Papa,
[1418.48] and we should end this story.
[1443.84] Where are you going?
Come we will drop you.
[1446.92] Come on. What are you thinking?
[1449.48] Wait. Listen to me.
[1451.16] Hey, why are you worried?
[1452.96] Come on, we are good people.
[1461.96] What happened?
[1463.56] Did you get scared in your sleep?
[1467.80] I am fine.
[1471.92] Did you have a bad dream?
[1474.80] Maybe.
[1479.88] No.
[1482.80] I…
[1483.84] Okay, if you are awake, 
then freshen up.
[1486.24] Everyone must be waiting 
for us over breakfast.
[1490.16] Breakfast?
[1496.08] At this hour?
[1498.72] Yes.
[1499.64] I agree it is 12 noon,
[1502.00] but this is the time we wake up.
[1504.20] At times, we even wake up later than this.
[1509.24] Okay.
[1511.48] Don’t you people go to 
university or college?
[1519.44] We have studied as much as we had to.
[1523.12] Okay, hurry up. We will talk about 
the rest over breakfast.
[1527.52] Will you wait for a little while?
[1530.68] Then we will go together.
[1532.36] I don’t know the way around here.
[1536.96] This is our home,
[1538.64] not a carnival that you are afraid 
of the feeling of getting lost.
[1545.36] It's a strange place,
[1549.28] and one feels fear in unfamiliar 
surroundings.
[1557.76] You get ready. I will come to get you.
[1560.28] And yes, I picked this dress for you, wear it.
[1564.32] This? No, no, this is absolutely fine.
[1567.40] These are good clothes.
[1569.12] This way, all your clothes will get dirty.
[1573.08] I am fine with these. 
I will continue to wear them.
[1577.32] Dua, mama stays really up to date,
[1579.76] and she wants us too 
remain tip-top like her.
[1582.64] If she sees you in this dressing 
then I will get scolded,
[1585.68] that I didn’t care for the guest,
 this and that.
[1588.00] That’s why, listen to me,
[1589.96] get up, change, get ready 
and please come out.
[1595.28] Why do you want me to get scolded, man.
[1597.52] Come quickly.
[1601.24] Okay.
[1602.20] Okay. Good girl.
[1679.64] I love you a lot.
[1691.76] I want you to just stay with me, Dua.
[1722.52] What are you doing here?
[1729.08] You were talking in your sleep, so…
[1735.04] Hmm?
[1741.20] I don’t know.
[1749.60] Younger Saeein.
[1755.04] You go from here, I have to talk 
to Jaffar about something.
[1758.24] Talk in front of me.
[1760.96] What is it that you cannot 
talk about in front of me?
[1767.68] Do, as I tell you to do.
[1772.84] Leave from here.
[1783.16] Jaffar.
[1796.72] Greetings Saeein.
[1800.32] Greetings.
[1806.56] Is there some worry, Jaffar?
[1808.24] Err…
[1817.64] Is Dua, fine?
[1822.72] I don’t know anything, Saeein.
[1825.84] What does this mean?
[1828.36] Saeein, she is missing and
[1834.76] we have no news of where she is.
[1837.48] Jaffar, what does this mean?
[1840.40] Saeein,
[1843.24] I tried hard to find her.
[1847.24] Saeein, I feel something wrong 
has surely happened with her.
[1852.36] But, Saeein,
[1855.68] I cannot say anything without confirming.
[1859.28] Jaffar, nothing should happen to Dua.
[1863.08] What happened, Saeein?
[1865.96] I am fine. You have half an hour, find her.
[1869.52] Yes, Saeein, as you order.
[1889.20] Why don’t you listen to me,
[1891.52] what is the need to do this event?
 Cancel it.
[1895.48] Why are you arguing uselessly 
with me for so long?
[1899.80] I am not arguing, 
I am telling you the truth.
[1902.52] People didn’t find out 
on the wedding day
[1905.52] that my Sister-in-law ran away from home.
[1907.40] But is it necessary that we do 
this reception and inform them?
[1909.52] He is right. 
Hey, who will tell them?
[1912.72] No one in our entire family knows Mr. Aslam
[1915.76] and neither does anyone know 
if they have two daughters or three.
[1919.12] After all, Dua was not present 
on the day of the wedding,
[1922.56] so from where will her mention 
come from now?
[1925.72] Such things don’t remain hidden, Mr. Nazir.
[1928.68] My tailor called.
[1931.00] She was telling me that 
Dua had returned home.
[1938.32] Okay, thank God she had come back home,
[1941.68] she didn’t have any accident.
[1946.12] The ones who have accidents, they die.
[1949.68] They don’t go to the police station first
and then back to the home.
[1954.36] Mr. Aslam would surely know 
that his daughter did something.
[1959.76] That’s why he closed the door on her face,
[1962.08] he didn’t let her enter the home.
[1968.08] Do you hear that?
[1971.40] He is hiding his face 
because of his daughter
[1974.12] and we go around celebrating 
the reception of his other daughter?
[1977.60] Wow, Mr. Nazir,
[1979.36] you surprise me.
[1981.04] Hey, if you are surprised, 
then so be it.
[1983.40] I will surely organize my son’s reception,
 understand?
[1987.28] It would be better
 if you start your preparation.
[1998.88] Child,
[2001.40] you have no fault in all that has happened.
[2010.36] But I will not let any injustice
be done to you.
[2016.16] Sumbul.
[2017.64] Yes, papa?
Come here, child.
[2025.68] Child, take your Sister-in-law 
to her room and take care of her.
[2031.20] Fiza, child, you too must think that
[2033.52] God knows what home I have come to.
[2037.32] But don’t worry, 
God will make it all fine.
[2040.32] Go, child.
[2042.12] Yes, papa.
[2043.48] Sister-in-law.
[2046.44] Let’s go.
[2049.92] You must think.
[2052.24] We have lost our sleep because of her.
[2054.80] You were the one who was so interested 
in getting me married.
[2058.12] Is this how you have repaid me 
for my obedience?
[2060.16] How was I to know
[2062.24] that these bitter almonds 
will come in our share?
[2067.76] It would have been better had 
I eloped and gotten married.
[2070.44] Huh?
[2093.52] What news did you bring, Jaffar?
[2096.16] Saeein, the news is really bad.
[2103.28] What is the matter, Jaffar? 
Tell me, clearly.
[2105.96] Saeein,
[2107.96] I had kept a close watch, but…
