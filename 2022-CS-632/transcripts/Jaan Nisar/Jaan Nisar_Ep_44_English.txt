I was yet to teach her a lesson, why is she leaving so soon? Did she come here to make me jealous? I won’t let her go from here so soon, how can I just let her go? Where are you going? I am going to iron Madam Jr's clothes. Madam Jr who? I am your only madam, that’s it. Okay, sure. This, bring this to my room. Quickly. Okay. What are you doing, Madam? Shh.... Speak slowly, someone might hear you. Touching the iron like this 
will give an electric shock. Yes, that is what I want, I want her to get an electric shock. Do you want me to die? I want death but not for you, for someone else. Okay, listen. Do you understand? Very well. You don’t worry at all. Just go and keep it over there, okay? Okay. And you don’t touch this at all. Okay. It feels like our mansion
 has been completed today, there is only one thing missing. What is missing, Mom? Even I and Dua are with you. My eyes have been 
longing to see your child. Umm, your Amma Saeein is right. I wouldn’t regret dying 
if I get to see your child. Don’t say that Baba Saeein, you just get well soon, and we will give you 
the good news very soon. Pirah? Pirah, the clothes are ironed… Pirah? I am getting late and this? Dua? Dua? Dua, What happened? Dua? Dua, what happened? Pirah? Dua? Dua, get up. Pirah? Thank God, at least you picked up my call, I have been calling you for so long. When you know that I am ignoring you, then why are you calling again and again? Why aren’t you talking to me? What is my fault? It’s not your fault but my fault that I got married to you despite
 knowing your brother’s nature. And didn’t you see how he put 
a show at the restaurant the other day? Are you regretting? Your brother is forcing me. Don’t be mad at me. Do you know, this was our first 
official dinner after getting married, that your brother has
ruined by misbehaving? I don't know what issue he has with me. Dad has scolded Brother a lot, he will be careful next time. He is your brother, that is why you are defending him 
and saying all this. I know your brother very well now, he is not a human being, he is a monster, a monster. I feel sorry for Sister-in-law, how is that poor woman living her life? Okay now you promise me,
 you won’t be mad at me. It depends, it depends on your brother’s behavior, and I won’t make any promise that 
I am unable to fulfill in the future. You should have at least 
just said it to make me feel better. Hmm, I’ll try. Tell me something, you are getting your 
daughter married to him, are you also putting
 this house in his name? Don’t misbehave, Sarfaraz. I am not misbehaving, I just realized my value in this house today. And look at her, I mean, he humiliated her brother but she is shedding tears for him who got upset and left. For God’s sake, at least spare someone. Look, how worried she is. She just got married and 
you have put up this show. What show? You guys have no idea what he is. How do you feel now? A lot better. Thank God that you weren’t hurt much. But what happened? I don’t know, I gave my clothes for ironing to Pirah, she didn’t do it so 
I started to do it myself, as soon as I inserted the plug, there was a spark and then I don’t remember anything after that. God has been kind. I have given charity in your name. What was the need for
you to start ironing yourself? There are so many servants at home, you could have asked anyone. I am fine. Yes, Sir, did you call me? How did all this happen? I don’t know, Sir. When Madam Jr. 
asked you to iron her clothes then where did you disappear? Madam Mizna stopped me. I was just coming to iron 
the clothes after comforting her. Such carelessness, Pirah? What if something had
 happened to Madam Jr? For Madam Jr, I can sacrifice
 my parents, Madam, but what did I know that 
she will start ironing herself? Didn’t you even know the wire is sparking and it can harm someone? Sir, had I known, wouldn’t I bring another iron? After all, I was the one
 who was supposed to iron. Then I would have been 
lying unconscious instead of Madam. Now, don’t talk so much, go away from here, and be careful next time. Okay. You take rest, my child, yeah? Okay. Take care of her. Okay. Fiza, you must make 
the younger one understand. Why? Our Sania is so sensible, what is the need to make her understand? She is not sensible at all. She keeps on saying weird things. What is the matter? Ever since your sister-in-law 
Sumbul got her wedding done, I and your dad have also planned to look for a nice match for Sania and get her wedding done as well and then we will send her off in a year or so. That’s a nice thought, and the time that you have
 thought of is appropriate as well. Is there any suitable or nice match
 that you may have found? Hey, a suitable and nice match will 
only be found when we will try finding it, Hun,
and before even trying to find it, Miss Sania has put 
a time bomb on our heads. Why? What happened, Sania? Yeah? Miss Sania says that she will only marry when she finds someone
 as rich and loving as Brother Ghaznavi. Really, Sania? Did you actually say that
 or Mom is just saying? Hmm, Yes, you are right! Mom, by the way, I think, 
Sania is absolutely right. Oh, so you have started to talk like her as well? Hmm, That is the reality, every girl wants a rich and loving husband. Not everyone gets everything. Dua was the fortunate one to get everything. Yes, you are right, it’s Dua’s good luck but you know, we can still compromise on money but how can a woman spend such 
a long journey without love? And I think my Sania is not 
demanding anything wrong. We will look for a very
 nice match for Sania where no matter if the guy is not very rich, but at least rich enough to fulfill
 all the wishes of my sister, she doesn’t have to crave anything and who loves her and always keeps her happy. I will go serve the food. Oh, so you are blushing? So, this was all attempted by you? Yes, it was an attempt by me but see you are saved. When you know I am so fortunate then why do you make such attempts? You won’t survive every time. I won’t miss the target next time, I will kill you at any cost. I am surprised, how are you alive with 
so much poison in you? I won’t die, Dua, I won’t die before killing you. Miss Kashmala, everyone 
loves you a lot in this house, they take so much care of you
 but you are… Only you, I don’t have a problem with anyone else, I just have a problem with you and this hatred will also end if you
 get out of Nosherwan’s life. This wish of yours cannot be fulfilled, sorry. I very well know how to 
fulfill every wish of mine. Fiza, does Sarfaraz not love you? I don’t know, Mom. That’s amazing, you are his wife, if you 
don’t know then who knows if your husband loves you or not? Sarfaraz’s anger takes over everything, I am unable to find out if he loves me or not. Parents can only judge the decency of the boy’s
 family before getting their daughters married. A mother cannot see if her daughter will get 
love from there or not. Mom, you know what? I was thinking we would let
 Sania marry by her choice. We will find a boy who loves her a lot. Look, Dua is also very happy because Brother Ghaznavi loves her a lot. Maybe. Oh, Dua reminded me of, where is she? It has been so many days 
that I didn’t meet her. Didn’t she even come to your house? No, she did come, we met and talked. She has gone to the mansion these days, Ghaznavi’s father is not well so they have gone there to see him. Umm, I will go help Sania with food, I am very hungry, 
and I will quickly get it served. Am I not watching both 
my sisters living their lives? Brother Sarfaraz does 
not value Sister at all. He doesn’t have money, but the arrogance, it never ends, whereas, look at Brother Nosherwan, he is also rich and he loves Sister crazily. My child, it’s all about fate. Dua had all of this in her fate. If that’s how it is, then Mom, I pray that my fate is not like Sister Fiza but Sister Dua instead. Shall we leave? Go safely. Next time come for longer. Now you all should come to Karachi. Stay blessed. Bye. Bye. Stay happy and go safely, my child. Bye. Bye. I am Nosherwan’s first wife. What difference does it make
 who is first and who is second? What makes a difference is, who has Ghaznavi given this rank to? Hey, Khizar, son, why are you standing outside? Come inside. Sarfaraz, give him way. Greetings, uncle. Greetings, come, son, come, sit. Sarfaraz, go inside and inform your mom that Khizar is here and also ask her to make tea. Mom? Mom? Hey, what happened? Why are you calling me? Your brilliant son-in-law is here. Hey, Khizar? Greetings, Aunt Greetings, son, how are you? Sit. Khizar, thank you so much, son, that you came here because I called you. I wanted to talk to you about something. Whatever happened the other
 day shouldn’t have happened. My child, I don’t want to get 
into an argument about whether it was your mistake or Sarfaraz’s, but there is a need for both 
of you to understand that Sumbul’s relationship with 
both of you won’t be broken. Now if both of you don’t 
clear your misunderstandings, Sumbul would be the 
most affected by this fight. Uncle, I admit that Sumbul is a sister and 
a daughter in this home but she has been tied in 
a new relationship now. She is your daughter and your sister, and now she is my wife too. Uncle, I have no doubts about the fact that you guys love Sumbul a lot, I am sure you do and you should but no one has the right to insult me or jeopardize my honor. The other day Sarfaraz insulted me a lot, I took it that day. Uncle, I will tell you a small thing, do I not have a right on my wife to take her out to a restaurant to have food, do I not have that right? You are right, son, I am sure you have a right on
 Sumbul after the wedding but people don’t like it when you 
hang out without marrying her off, it becomes an eyesore for them and people also raise their fingers. But still, I admit I did allow 
you to take her out, but in this matter, after allowing you, I thought and I also wanted to talk to
 you again regarding this. My child, I think I might not be able to allow you again. Uncle, I had no such intentions to take Sumbul out again and again. And I won’t be able to bear it 
if anyone raises a finger at Sumbul. I will be careful next time, Uncle. Our son-in-law is very sensible. Still, I expected such sensibility from you. You made the tea already? Yes, I did. I thought I would make tea by 
my own hands for Khizar today. Hey, you could have told me earlier. You could have also asked me first. If I knew you had such plans, I wouldn’t have made it. Hey, Fiza? Yes, I am bringing it. Give me a chance to score some points 
in front of my husband as well. Enough now, how much will you work? You will get tired. Here, anything else? Hey, such obedience? You just try saying it once, I will also give my life for you this quickly. I don’t need your life, I need your companionship forever. That is there forever. Okay, tell me, did you get any call from the mansion? Did you talk to anyone? How is Baba Saeein now? Yes, I just spoke to them a while ago, he is well now. I spoke to Amma Saeein, as well. Hmm, by the way, I felt you would be a little disturbed 
after coming back from the mansion but thank God that didn’t happen. Disturbed, why? Because of the same iron incident. It was meant to happen and it did. I don’t know why I feel 
someone did that on purpose. I don’t think so. I suspect Kashmala. You won’t survive every time. I won’t miss the target next time, I will kill you at any cost. I am surprised, how are you alive with 
so much poison in you? I won’t die, Dua, I won’t die before killing you. Maybe, had I been a little strict with Pirah, she would have taken the name. It’s not that but let’s suppose, if Kashmala’s name had been taken, what would you do then? I would behave harshly with her. Harshly? No, no, I already feel pity for her and you would have been even harsher with her. You feel pity and that too on Kashmala? You are feeling pity for a woman who would kill you if she ever gets a chance. Let her, life and death are in the hands of God and I wouldn’t die before it’s my time. By the way, you are quite different 
from the rest of the women. I mean, when you talk about a second 
wife in front of a woman, she often starts trash-talking, and you are taking her side. The grief of one-sided love is very deep, she loves you a lot. Whenever she looks at you, I feel like her heart is crying. So, what do you want? Should I also start looking towards her? Would you be able to bear that? No. If you can’t then don’t say 
such things that will hurt you. One day, Kashmala will realize 
that she wasted her time. And she might also marry someone else, that is what I think. Hmm. What are you thinking? That you really enjoy teasing me. You have given me a chance yourself.
