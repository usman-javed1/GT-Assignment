Do you want to get out of there? And what do I have to pay for this freedom? You won’t have to pay anything. Then why this kindness for me? When you have come here looking for me, you will also know that my own family closed
the doors of my house on me. I know that, if you need a house to stay,
my house is there for you. You can live there comfortably. I will keep all the blessings of
this world on your feet. I guess you are saying all this because you have bought my time
by giving that cheque to Zunaira, and you think that you keep me
in your luxurious house by throwing a lot of such
cheques on her face. The first time, the first time before putting
a price on me, you didn’t even for once ask me
what I wanted, and I came with you, but luck won’t be in your favor
for the second time. Zunaira can be inspired by your money
and position, but not me. You are getting me wrong, I have especially only offered you
to stay in my house, if I was some wrong man, I would have given this offer to
a lot of more girls before you. Then, why now? As per what relationship
can I live in your house? It will be better if we don’t talk
about this topic again. Not every woman gets sold for money. Will you marry me? Bashir, didn’t she come yet? No. She should have come by now. You shouldn’t have just trusted someone. He is not someone, he is Mr. Nosherwan Ghaznavi, you fool. Rumi, has Dua ever discussed with you that she knows some Ghaznavi or met him somewhere in the past? No, she never discussed it with me. In fact, I think she is meeting him
for the first time today. She has already wounded one man, that clamored-fussy Dua, had she been meeting Ghaznavi
for the first time, she wouldn’t have gone
with him so easily. Absolutely, Shall I find out if you say? You will have to find out. But for now, find out where are they. Okay. There is no need to send
anyone anywhere. So, you guys are back. When I promised you and took Dua, then why do you look so restless? I and restless? Not at all. Actually, Dua is not aware of the habits
and manners of this place yet. I was worried that something might happen
that you might not like. You might not like what I am about to talk to you. What has happened? No one should put their eye on her now. I didn’t get it. I have used very clear
and easy language. But I will die starving that way. You will eventually die
if you don’t listen to me. Only I have a right on her and you cannot take this right away
from me at all. I admit, Mr. Ghaznavi that
your money, wealth, name, and power talk in this city, but we know some people here as well. You paid to take her along, I allowed, but now what you are doing is wrong. Only I have the right to make any decision and you cannot do anything about it. Let’s not talk about what I can do
and what I cannot, I can take Dua away in front of your
eyes right here, right now, if I want to, and even your pet animals
cannot stop me from doing this. I will come tomorrow, till then she is as my possession
here with you. I will pay as much as you want
to get Dua out of this prison, and that won’t be Dua’s price, but it will be a charity
in her name for you all. I am marrying Dua. And I hope you will not give
my wife-to-be any sort of chance to complain. Keep this. I will be worried for you. Only this phone can make up
for the distance between us for now. Be careful that this phone shouldn’t be turned off, otherwise, I won’t feel even
the slightest bit of pain in stopping the breaths of
the people over here. As you wish. I will come tomorrow, wait for me. You turned out to be very secretive, you didn't even tell me you knew him. I, myself am unaware of
what is happening to me, how would have I told you? It means the guy is involved
in one-sided love? I don’t know, I didn’t ask him. Hey, why are you making me mad? Okay, tell me, when did you meet Nosherwan? First time, I guess a few days before I came here. And how was that meeting? It means that you slapped
Nosherwan’s scout, and you scolded him and left? I only met him then, it was a short meeting and then I saw him
at the party last night. You agree or not, the guy has fallen for you big time. I don’t know. Why are you sad? You should be happy. He, He, he knows what hell
I have been through. True love doesn’t give
importance to anything. Nosherwan loved you with
all his heart and he got you. And look, how easily he spoke about
taking you out of here. I can’t believe it. A prince came after you without
you having to lose your shoe like Cinderella, so who would believe it? Now forget all the worries and be happy. By the way, did you see Zunaira’s face? I swear I felt pity for the poor woman. I am very happy for you Dua, I have never seen this happening here, that a hero would come and
take his heroine from here. You are actually very lucky. If I was lucky, I wouldn’t be here. How did you agree? I am surprised. What else would have I done
if I hadn’t agreed? Should I have become
enemies with Ghaznavi? And had I done this, he would have made us pack our bags
and taken us far away from the city and would have gotten us killed by anonymous people at
an anonymous location. We are not that helpless either, we could have used our cards too. I guess you are forgetting that Ghaznavi can very successfully
play our cards against us. You know that, right? If Dua leaves, all the girls will get rebellious
in the future. Don’t worry, not everyone is that brave. Anyway, let’s see what he pays for his love. Okay, now that you have decided everything, what can I do? Let that nobleman take Dua
out of here once, I know the nature of
these men very well, I recognize it very well. The faster they fall into
the passion of love, the faster they come out of it. It would be moonlight for four days. What will you wear in the morning? Let me know, I will iron them too. Why? Where do I have to go? Dad said you will assist him
at the shop until you get a job. Dad said and I heard and it’s up to me to implement it. Do you understand? And this is not the first time
that he asked me. What do you mean? Won’t he mind it? Why are you so worried about him? He is my father, I know and no one knows him better than me. He wants me to go and sit at that shop but I do what I feel like, so shut up with your rubbish. Yes, but there is also a lot of difference
between then and now, you are married now, you need to seriously think
about a job or business now. Now you will tell me
what I have to do? No, I was just saying, you should assist Dad…
Okay, okay, okay, I get it, actually you are jealous that you are
going to work from tomorrow at your school, and I will be sitting at home,
that is your problem, right? No, why would I think that? Don’t even think that,
do you understand? Do you know, you are being
upset for no reason? No reason? I am doing all this without a reason? Don’t get me started,
do you understand? Even now I am just tolerating you
in this house because of my father, otherwise, I would have thrown
you out a long time back. I cannot even sit in my room in peace. Move!
Sarfaraz? What happened? Where is he going? What happened to him? What happened? Why did he get upset and go out? Nothing. Nothing? So, was he yelling for no reason? Getting angry for no reason?
Went out for no reason? Yeah? No, I was just trying to
make him understand that he should get serious about a job now and until he gets a job he should
sit at the shop with Dad. Madam, like you have kept Rs. 1000s
of worth of salary in my hands that you don’t like your husband
sitting at home? No, I was just telling him. Enough, enough, you don’t
need to be his grandmother, his parents are still alive
to make him understand. And if you really wanted to be a teacher, you should have made
your sister understand, like she has made the family very proud! Bells call others to church
but don’t go themselves! Wow, you are one to be a teacher
who will make others understand. Sarfaraz? Why are you following me like
a back-footed witch? What is wrong with you? Look, don’t eat my brain,
go away from here. Why are you upset? If I wasn’t upset, I would still be sitting there listening
to your rubbish. Okay, I won’t say anything.
Come, let’s go to the room. Look, leave me alone and go away. Listen, if someone sees you here,
what will they think? So let them see, someone will see. Go. Okay, listen, I made a mistake, forgive me. I don’t need your apology and
I don’t need your companionship. Do you understand? Get lost. Why are you doing this to me? What have I done to you? Go inside and finish your drama
of whining and crying. And if I hear your voice now,
I would be the worst. Get lost. Made a joke out of me. Over everything… Do this, do that, why aren’t you
going to the shop? Like she is one to make me understand! I have especially only offered you
to stay in my house, if I was some wrong man, I would have given this offer to
a lot more girls before you. Then, why now? As per what relationship can I live
in your house? Will you marry me? I will come tomorrow, till then she is as my possession
here with you. I will pay as much as you want
to get Dua out of this prison, and that won’t be Dua’s price, but it will be a charity
in her name for you all. I am marrying Dua. And I hope you will not give
my wife-to-be any sort of chance to complain. I will be worried for you. Only this phone can make up for
the distance between us for now. I was going to make breakfast, you freshen up and come too. Go, where you are getting ready to go. There is no need to worry about me, there are a lot of people to
take care of me in this house. I don’t understand why are you
doing this to me. I have been trying to make it
up to you all night, but you didn’t even listen to me once. Why should I listen to you? I am your wife, I have the right to question you. You have no right, do you understand? Now, get lost, don’t eat my brain. First, this damn light woke me up
and now she is talking. Why are you looking at my face?
Get out of here. Sumbul will look after all this, you quickly get ready,
have breakfast, and go to school, I am afraid
you might miss your bus. Okay. Miss the bus?
What do you mean? Isn’t Faraz responsible for picking up
and dropping her off at the school? Yes, yes, Sarfaraz is responsible, but the thing is,
he has his interview today, poor boy was preparing
for the interview all night, he didn’t sleep at all
he just slept a while ago, he asked me not to wake him up early, so he can be fresh for the interview. But brother was sleeping on the roof. He went to the roof with the laptop
so Fiza’s sleep would not be disturbed, he was doing his preparations over there,
and he might have fallen asleep. But it doesn’t seem right that Fiza
should go to the school alone like this, she is the daughter-in-law of our house. Why doesn’t it look right? Fiza used to go alone before as well. Right, Fiza? Do you have a problem going? No, I will, I will manage,
you let Sarfaraz rest. See, your daughter-in-law is so sensible. I know that my daughter-in-law
is very intelligent. And your useless son should be thankful to get a sensible girl like her as a wife. Okay, my child, Fiza, you must go and quickly get ready, okay? Go. Hey, at least let her properly
have her breakfast. No, I am done. Go. And if your useless son didn’t have
to go to drop Fiza, he could have at least had
breakfast with us. I told you he wanted
to get enough sleep. Let him get enough sleep! Hmph! Brother, are we going the right way? Sister, we are going the right way,
absolutely right way. Driver a little fast,
I am getting late. Sister, I am driving fast,
how fast should I drive? Fiza? Mom? Mom? My child.
How are you sister? School this early morning? I have rejoined the school from today. You have joined the school? My child, it hasn’t been many days
since your wedding. And you said you won’t. Yes, but I have rejoined now, are you here to drop Sania? Where were you yesterday?
I looked for you so much as well. Dad wasn’t in favor of me
going back to school, Mom has taken permission
to pick me up and drop me off, so he got convinced
after so much difficulty. Why did you join the school? You should have given time
to your in-laws. I am very late, Mom,
assembly must have started. We are actually very late, Mom, you go home, I will come home
with sister Fiza, then we will sit and talk properly. No, I will go back to my home, Sania. Umm, no my child, both of you come home, have food, and then go, in fact, call Sarfaraz and
ask him to pick you up. Sarfaraz is busy with his interview, that is why I am saying I will come
some other day. And why are you standing here?
You will get punished, quickly go, the assembly has started. Mom,
you must go home now, I will take care of Sania.
Okay, I am getting late. Bye. Jaffar, are all the preparations
for the evening done? Yes, all the preparations including
the Muslim Scholar are completed. You won’t have any complaints. You have never given a chance
to complain that you will give now. Thank you. Greetings, Mom. Greetings. I was just coming to pick you up,
you came all alone. Your Dad will be so mad if he finds out. I haven’t come alone, sister dropped me
at the corner of the road. If Fiza was here,
you should have brought her home. I insisted her a lot, but she didn’t agree, she was just saying
she was getting late. Mom. Hasn’t sister started to act
strange very soon? Sister wasn’t like this. My child, a sensible girl does this
after getting married, she tries to hide from her family. I felt she was also on purpose
avoiding me at school so I don’t ask her something. Hmm, I felt that too., Fiza is definitely hiding something. Sister never even traveled
in public transport, school and college both were nearby. She must be facing so much difficulty. Brother Sarfaraz could have
dropped her too. I don’t know what is it, I am very worried for Fiza. Mom, why did sister join school so soon? Are her in-laws forcing her? God knows. Okay, don’t talk about Fiza’s school joining
in front of your Dad. But until when can we hide it from him? First let me talk to Fiza myself then I will tell him. Okay, I am very hungry. Get food for both of us.
I will come to lay it. No, you freshen up,
I will lay it. No, I will lay it,
you just dish it out. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Yes, greetings, Baba Saeein. Where is Nosherwan? He is here in front of me. Why isn’t he receiving my call? Call… Make me talk to him.
Okay, I will just do that. Sir Jr, Baba Saeein will talk. Greetings, Baba Saeein. Nosherwan, where are you right now? I am somewhere for an important work. Is everything okay? Leave for the mansion right now. Meet me. Right now? Didn’t you hear what I said? No, I heard you but can I come
sometime tomorrow? Are you busy somewhere special today? Yes, I have some special work today. Your special work is more
important than my order?
