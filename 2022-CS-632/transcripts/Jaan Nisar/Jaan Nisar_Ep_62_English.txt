-Please, come in.
-Thank you. Greetings. Greetings, son. He has come to meet you. You should have called me
if you needed something. I called many times,
but you didn’t answer, son. Please sit. -Okay.
-You go. Yes, alright. Would you like tea or coffee? No, no son, no formalities,
there’s no need for any formalities. Yes, tell me. Son, I came to talk about the matters
going on between you and my daughter. What, what is the solution for this? Dua must have the solution for this. Haven’t you asked her? Son, if she had a solution, then why would I have come to you? What do you want, son?
Please tell me. I don’t want to talk about anything right now,
especially not about Dua. You are my elder and have come here.
I respect you a lot, but still, I don’t want to talk about Dua. Son, things will get very
messed up this way. Both of you should sit down
and try to resolve the issue. I don’t have any solution. And after everything that
my eyes have seen, I’ve barely stopped myself from
making any drastic decisions. There must be some solution. Son, maybe you’ve had
a misunderstanding. That’s why I’m asking you
to give me some time. I need a little time to think. Once I make a decision,
I’ll surely inform you. Nazia, bring some tea, child. Greetings. Is this the time for daughters-in-law
to wake up in decent homes? Mom, We weren’t able to wake up. so one of you could have woken us up
or knocked, it wasn’t a big deal. When you didn’t feel ashamed
in front of your young sisters, then how can we show shamelessness? Alright, tell me, have you all had breakfast? It’s 1 o’clock in the afternoon. The whole world must be done with lunch, and you're talking about breakfast. Alright, Sister, at least give us breakfast. Maha, go and give them breakfast. By the way, shouldn’t breakfast have come
from Sister-in-law Sumbul’s house? I’ve said it many times,
and I’m saying it one last time, I’ve strictly told Sumbul’s family
not to perform any useless rituals. And you’re younger so act like it. Don’t talk too much. Really? You did very well. You didn’t take the dowry,
you didn’t get the ring, and even canceled the breakfast. It seems like you’ve given
all the favors to your wife’s family. If you were going to act this way, what was the point of marrying
into a wealthy family? You should have taken us
to a shelter home, and I would’ve married you
to a poor orphan girl. At least, our hearts wouldn’t
have burned like this. -Mom...
-What, Mom? I’m speaking the truth. Sister, please, just give us breakfast. Alright, fine. You go. The breakfast will come to the room. Listen, be careful, everyone will have breakfast
together from tomorrow. Get up early. Yes, Mom. It got so late during the send-off, that’s why I couldn’t wake up. Well, miss, we were also with
you during the send-off. It got late for us too, but we still woke up at
the time of Dawn’s prayer, and this is the upbringing
I’ve given to my daughters as well. Yes, Mom, we’ll be careful from now on. The neighborhood women are
coming to see the bride, and they are leaving after making
remarks because the door is closed. And these are the actions of your bride? And in a house where
there are young sisters, the doors don't stay closed for a long time. There is a limit to being shameful. We used to wake up at
the time of Dawn prayer and immediately start serving
our mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law. Didn’t we get tired? Did you see her attitude? Mom, what’s wrong? Why are you getting so angry? It’s her first day,
cut her some slack. Come on. Why should I cut her some slack? Make it clear to her that she should
show this attitude to her own family. She shouldn’t be under any misconception. I won’t tolerate any of her tantrums. Mom, please stop now. I should stop? You better keep your mouth shut. You went behind our backs
and pulled this stunt. You have young sisters sitting at home, and you left to arrange your marriage. Do you know how badly this action of yours
will affect your sisters? Listen carefully, I won’t tolerate any such behavior. Did you hear me? Water. You went to see Ghaznavi. What happened? Fehmida, he wasn’t even
willing to listen to anything. What do you mean
he wasn’t willing to listen? So, how long will Dua stay at home? From his demeanor, it seemed like he has made a harsh decision. Fehmida, I don’t think he will take Dua back. What do you mean? Both of our daughters
are going to get divorced? Things are not looking good, Fehmida. My heart is sinking. Then you should have made him understand,
you should have talked to him. That’s why I sent you. Hey, I went because you asked me to. Okay, listen, if you aren’t able
to resolve things, take me to Ghaznavi. I’ll talk to him. I’ll ask him, how can he make such a decision. If there was any benefit in taking you,
I would have taken you. That’s why I went by myself. It would be better to wait a little. Let him make his decision. Let him think. When he makes the decision,
then we will see. Oh God, oh God, have mercy. What else is left to see? Don’t worry, God will make everything right. Man, is this the time to
visit your daughter's in-laws? Sister, we left on time, but there was so much traffic on the way. Yes, man, your car always
gets stuck in traffic, and your daughter doesn’t wake up
before 1 o’clock because she’s so tired. One thing is clear, being late is in your nature. Sister, what did my daughter even
do on the first day of her marriage? What did your daughter do? Your princess didn’t wake up before 1 o'clock. Is this the kind of upbringing
you’ve given her? Daughters-in-law from respectable
families don’t behave this way. Delays can happen with all
the excitement of the wedding, right? We’ve seen many families, and never have we seen or heard
of this kind of spectacle on the first day. Mom, Mom, you’ve made a mountain
out of a molehill. You stay quiet. It's men like you who spoil their wives
by giving them undue freedom, and then spend their lives regretting it. Yes, on behalf of Mom,
I apologize to all of you, please. Keep your apology to yourself. You wanted to humiliate us
after calling us to your house, right? Are you done? Brother, you could have stayed a little longer. Then what? What more do you want? If there’s any humiliation left, let me know. If so, we can have that done as well. Mom, are you coming, or should I leave? Son, please listen. What more is there to listen to? You’ve satisfied your desire to come 
to your daughter’s house and get humiliated here, right? Then let’s go. And this was your choice, right? Very nice. Let’s go, Mom. I’m leaving. Today, when you’re the one being humiliated,
your honor has suddenly awakened, hasn’t it? You’ve already ruined
that innocent girl’s life. Even during her pregnancy, you didn’t
stop putting mountains of grief on that girl. Shame, you felt no shame. Don't think of me as lowly, like you. Why are you all fighting
amongst yourselves? Enough, I’ve had enough! I’ve tolerated you enough! Do you think this is a joke? This, this was his true nature all along. This was his true nature behind
his façade of decency. This was his true nature. What kind of spectacle have
you all created in my home? Make your son understand,
and control yourself as well. I’ve tolerated you people enough! You are the rude one. And your daughter is rude like you as well. Don’t you dare! There's no need to say anything to my son. If you wanted to teach someone manners, you should’ve taught your sister,
taught your daughter. I’ve been saying from the beginning that
this marriage shouldn’t have happened. Now you’ve seen the result. Oh, Mom, it’s just his ego problem,
nothing else. He will keep speaking nonsense.
Come on, go from here. So, why would we tolerate this? No, Brother, please, Brother. -Let them go.
-Mom, let’s go! Brother, please. I suggest you take your sister
along with you as well. Do you see it now? I’ve been saying from the start
that this is not a good family. Go on and never listen to your mother. Did you see how they behave? They didn’t raise their daughter right. What effect will this have on your sisters? That’s why I was stopping you. You’ve made a huge mistake. This, this is why I told you guys
to not get her married there. But no, at that time, it was as if your eyes
were blindfolded by the police uniform, and you could only see his good qualities. Are you satisfied now?
Suffer now. His family completely humiliated us. In my opinion, we are also
at fault in this whole matter. How is this our fault? You’re unbelievable. Instead of supporting us,
instead of saying we’re right, you’re siding with them
and calling us wrong. I don’t know why, but it feels like this is the beginning
of payback for actions. After all, isn’t this what we did with Fiza? Oh, come on! Now, where does the payback
for actions come into this? And when did we humiliate Fiza’s family
for not bringing breakfast? Their daughter and Fiza’s sister
ran away on the night of her wedding. Who could have been
in their senses at that point? Neither they nor we were in our senses. Whenever I come to this house,
my head feels like it’s going to explode because I keep hearing things like this. It’s better if I don’t come here at all. Hasn’t he started getting angrier? Why did you call? It was necessary. I had told you not to call. I will call you myself at the right time. You’re not allowed to call like this. I need money. Right now? You can’t get money right now. Why can’t I get them?
I’ve been doing all the work, but whenever I ask for money,
you avoid the topic. I’m telling you, I need my money
tomorrow, all two million of it. I can’t just pull out such
a large amount right now. What do you mean?
Do you not have any money at all? Look, I’m not an ATM, nor do I walk around with
two million in my wallet. I can’t arrange it right now. Look, I don’t care
what your problem is or not. I need the money tomorrow,
no matter what. And if you don’t get it, then? You need to understand something, when a partnership turns into enmity, it becomes very dangerous. Are you threatening me? You can take it however you like, but I need the money tomorrow. Understood? It’s good you’ve come.
I knew you would come. Here you go. Is this two million? What is this? Two hundred thousand. What do you mean two hundred thousand?
I asked for two million. Be happy with this for now. Why should I be happy? You told me you’d give me
whatever I asked for, and you expect me to be happy
after handing me such a small amount? Do you think I’m a beggar? Sarfaraz, the work isn’t finished yet. Nosherwan hasn’t gotten
divorced from Dua yet. Once that happens,
you’ll get your full payment. Until then, consider this a blessing. And don’t let this slip away either. You have no idea what I can do to you. Don’t push me like this, understood? I’ll expose your true colors to everyone. You won’t do anything like that. You are taking me very lightly. What did you call me?
An idiot, right? That I didn’t record Dua.
Yes, I didn’t record her. But I have recordings saved
of every word you’ve said. And it won’t take me long
to bring it all out in the open. If you don’t give me my money. What do you think that you’ll threaten me like this
and I’ll get scared? You don’t know me. To get where I am, I’ve removed
many people from my path. I could destroy you so badly that your own family wouldn’t recognize you, but I don’t want to be angry. I want us to work together
happily and peacefully. What’s the need to ruin things? But you keep making me angry
by bringing up money again and again. Look, if we cooperate with each other. You’ll get all your money.
Just work with me. -You…
-Shabraiz! I think you understand very well now, or do I need to explain further? Good job. You were right. Ghaznavi doesn’t trust me at all. I’m completely alone now. Even Mom, Sania, and Fiza
have all become my enemy. I feel suffocated in this house. You have no idea how much
I’m trying to get you back into my life, and we, we will spend a very good,
a very good life together. You just have to trust me. Yes, I trust no one else but you now. I’ll divorce Ghaznavi and marry you. But, Sarfaraz, you’ll need to be completely honest with me. You won’t break my trust this time, right? You know that after the game
that Kashmala has played, Ghaznavi could become our enemy. You understand that, don’t you? Yes, yes. All of this is happening
because of Kashmala. She’s the one who made sure
the two of you were separated. Look, I have a lot of evidence against her. So, she won’t be able to harm us. As for Ghaznavi,
we’ll deal with him too. Alright, thank you. Okay listen, I’ll talk to you later. Alright. Take care of yourself, okay? My suspicions were right Kashmala was the one
who set Sarfaraz against me. Your pawn turned out
to be very weak, Kashmala. He spilled everything in a fit of affection. Now, I need to find a way
to get all that proof from him. Sarfaraz has become too clever
for his own good. I’ll have to deal with him, but first, I need to remove Dua from Nosherwan’s life. I can deal with Sarfaraz later. First, I have to take care of this. I know you never loved me. If you had, you wouldn’t have left me in that hell. So, what changed suddenly that your love that never existed awakened
and you reached this point? Dua, I did love you. I just got scared.
I had nothing at the time. There was pressure from my family, and they had already arranged
my marriage to Fiza. To protect my parent’s honor, I had no choice
but to follow their orders. But now you’re with me,
I don’t care about anything, I have no worries. Why would I be worried? Because of you all of
Ghaznavi’s wealth will be mine. But I only have a house. How will all of this happen? I want to have a lot with me
when I divorce Ghaznavi. Yes, so don’t worry about that at all. I just want you to support me
so that we won’t suffer any loss. You know Kashmala, right? I’ll get a large sum out of her. Why will she give you anything? She will. Listen to this. You want to remove Dua from the picture because you want to win Ghaznavi over, right? You also want this, right? To get Dua, and not just Dua but all her wealth as well. When benefits are the same it’s important
to have information about each other. Tell me, do you accept this deal? What will the percentage be? Everything that belongs to Dua will be yours. Nosherwan still hasn’t understood
Dua’s cunningness. The girl who tried to take his life
has played with his honor, and he still can’t get her out of his heart. He hasn’t even been able
to end his relationship with her. This is what troubles us too, what is really going on
in Nosherwan’s heart? He seems to be suffocating. Nosherwan will have to make a decision, we will talk to him. What will you say, Baba Saeein? Even after treating him so badly,
Dua has still not left his heart, and then there’s me, who has devoted herself to him, yet he has never given me
a place in his life, not even a little place in his heart. You don’t need to worry. Dua may be in Nosherwan’s life, but she has already left his heart. Once someone leaves the heart, they hold no significance in life. He’s tired of her himself. He will eventually give her divorce one day. No one can deny your importance,
Kashmala. You will certainly get your right. Hmm.
