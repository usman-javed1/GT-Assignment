[0.16] [Song]
[11.76] You look beautiful while laughing. I thought that's why your mood was always off because
[18.56] you do not want to marry me. Why won't I want to meet you Nazrul
[24.48] don't rush into getting marriage
[31.03]  Won't you like it when you
[36.16] tell your friends how educated your wife is.
[41.80]  You will like it, and then within this time you will get a job, you
[48.20] get a lot of money, and then we will have a grand wedding. You will like it right?
[54.16] I will like it very much. Oh MashAllah!. You're so wise
[60.72] My father just doesn't understand. Can you please explain it to him that right now don't rush into marriage
[67.20] If you speak so lovingly, I'll delay the marriage by another 2-4 years.
[74.28] Hey Nazrul, you are very good.
[80.40] But I will do all this on one condition. What is that?
[87.60] That you will talk to me with such sweet words every day. Have you gone crazy? How will I talk daily
[94.08] Oh, we will do it on the phone wherelse. Nowadays all lovers talk on phone the entire night.
[99.96] I don't know what they talk about, but they talk all night.
[105.00] Where will so much money come from? Don't worry take it easy. I will bring it now mobile has become so cheap.
[110.72] Ok. You know Masood uncle right, he told father that
[115.80] get her married as soon as possible, now how will you stop him? My father?
[122.32] I will stop him, don't worry, ok. You just 
[130.08] sit comfortably and eat chips. Now I will make our heart happy. Should I sing with the tree?
[135.24] No, no sit and sing. Ok I will sit and sing. [Song] I can't sing while sitting
[143.44] I will have to stand. [Song]
[152.32] Hey, I will eat too. You can eat. 
[156.39] Mother I said nothing to Saeed.
[162.40] He quarrels with me himself. You are right, Aqeela, a good woman should be quiet when man quarrel so
[170.60]  the fight would end. Saaed is a very good child; he is not bad that heart. He's just short tempered.
[178.60] Aqeela. Saeed
[183.72] You will wear this.
[193.40] What's this? I brought veil for Aqeela
[202.96] Saeed will I wear this in the house?
[207.64] Saeed how can I wear this in home? Aqeela!... Have you gone mad, she covers her face in saree
[215.96] then what was the need to buy a veil. I brought it for the need. It is my choice she will not
[222.08]  roam around in the house like this, she will wear a veil. Now you will get beaten by me, everyone will make fun of you.
[227.96] They will laugh at us. When she goes out of the house, then she will wear a veil. Why will she wear it in house
[233.64] Ok, its fine but in the house she will hide her entire face with her saree
[238.96] She will not come in front of Nazrul. 
[243.56] Shameless! you're doubting your brother? I am not doubting him; I know his intentions are wrong. Now Aqeela 
[250.88] if you come in front of him, I will break your legs. Hey, shut up, are you crazy?
[255.60] I have not lost my mind. Hey, what is all this chaos about?
[261.48] What happened to Aqeela. Your son has completely lost his mind. I don't know whom
[268.88] he went on. He doubts his wife and quarrels
[274.58] I didn't do anything. I have said it once she won't come in front of Nazrul. Aqeela, you go inside.
[283.32]  I am going. Hey, where are you going? Talk to me ... Saeed.
[287.36] Father let him go otherwise he will quarrel with me.
[295.60] Now I will explain it to him myself. Now look at his actions.
[303.67] Five people were sent to Europe for one lakh rupees. Without ID card and passport?
[313.68] Anwar ul Haq did all the paperwork. He first took them to Iran then Istanbul
[320.84] then entered Europe. Now he's back and is collecting people. You collect 5 people then
[328.40] I will tell him to send you to Europe in half amount. Now you also see how hard is it over here
[335.44] all the time the police is behind, asking for ID cards. we can't even work anywhere
[340.92] Nazrul Salam, I've never even counted 1 lakh
[348.28] Where will I get so much money from? I don't know this, now if you want to go to Europe then you will have to invest it
[355.92] If you will invest money then you will go to Europe. You will earn in Euro. Euro is bigger than
[364.16] dollar. Now what do I get? 1 thousand rupees for 1 person. What will my benefit be
[373.20] You will go at absolutely half the expense. Only 50 thousand rupees
[376.44] Ok, I'll get something done. Great, now give 5000 rupees and I will get your name written.
[388.56]  If I don't go then? I will give you back your money. I give you my word and swear my 
[395.48] life on it. Come on takeout 5000 rupees. Nazrul Salam I only have 3000 rupees in my pocket
[404.68] Out of this I will give you 2000, I will keep 1000 for my expenses, ok? Yes, its, ok? Right now
[414.08] I will do something. Nazrul Salam you won't cheat with me, right?
[420.16] You will send me to Europe right? I am telling you my work might be shady, but my word is top notch
[428.56] Now don't worry. Hey Bunderi, I want to talk to you
[437.68] Light your cigarette, you are going Europe, you will see foreigners.

[545.24] Aashti now when will your college end?
[551.96] Why mother? Madam's brother and sister in law have come from abroad. Theres too much work
[558.84] I can not take leave, you know I am having my exams. When they will finish then
[563.96] I will come then. Exam, Exam! I am struck in trouble now. 
[571.52] Mother, do you know which country Madam's brother has come from? How would I know which country is he from
[577.76] Madam said if Aashti leaves her studies and work for her the entire month, then she will give her Rs 5000 per month
[584.88] Aashti, we have 20,000 rupees loan already. You will work for her for 6 months then
[592.64] MashAllah our loan will be repaid. Mother I will not
[598.64] work in anyone's house. Did I educate you so that you won't clean the house?
[602.48] Mother, studying doesn't mean that I will clean someones house. 
[609.52] I will work in someone's office. Who will give you a job in the office? Abrash Sir, he said to me.
[618.52] My opinion is that the nikah should take place first, followed by the rukhsati. 
[624.76] Hey Ali Alam, what are you saying? He is my only son. How could I just marry him off like that.
[628.76] I wanted simplicity. What do you want. I have such a big social circle.
[634.28] I have to invite them all, host dinners. Yes, we will have a grand wedding.
[639.04] Feed guests in gold utensils, otherwise how will people know
[643.92] how rich we are. Ali Alam, don't make fun of everything, first there
[650.32] will be engagement, then there will be shopping, there will be mehendi and all that. Everything will happen with a lot of fanfare,
[657.24] Brother dear, what I am saying is that it is a hassel
[662.36] Okay, but Shery is also saying the right thing. Look, he is your only son, we have only daughter,
[671.32]  We will try to fulfill all our wishes on this wedding
[676.36] Well, it is like that from my side you all have open permission to spend unnecessarily.
[682.80] So, sister-in-law, shall we decide the date of engagement? What is there to decide, we can keep it on next Sunday
[689.36]  It is absolutely fine. Congratulations brother
[694.04] My heart feels that we should ever go to the upper part of Pakistan. Trust me
[700.72] it is such a beautiful place that you will forget even Switzerland.
[706.48] Last time I was there, in Hunza. I have never seen such a scenery you know,
[711.60] in the middle of the mountains and the food available there is amazing, I mean seriously,
[717.16] I feel like going with you someday, so let's go. When?
[721.44] On the honeymoon, after marriage, daddy also says that Pakistan
[727.48] is very beautiful. So rather than going abroad we will go to Pakistan I have seen the whole world anyway.
[733.80] Are you sure? I was thinking that you will say that I want to go to Italy, I want to go to Turkey.
[739.28] I have no problem in going ,but trust me, that place is so beautiful, if you
[743.28] go with me to Muzaffarabad or Murree or anywhere else, you will go crazy, okay
[749.20] listen to me, we are talking about marriage, let's go inside and find out our date
[752.96] is getting fixed or not? Let's go and find out!
[758.52] I want it to happen as soon as possible. It's better.
[768.04] Look, I don't want to see you crying. Now, well done, smile, come on quickly,
[776.08] smile, smile 
[781.59] [Music]
[799.28] Hey Aashti are you sleeping or are you dead?
[805.64] What happened mother? You don't have to go to college? I have to. Then get up and make breakfast.
[813.60] Can't you make it? Stop being bossy Umeda is not feeling well she's not letting me work
[819.96] Now go make breakfast for your father, otherwise he won't let me go to work. Come on, get up
[828.12] What mother!
[832.88] Come on, be quick!
[853.81]  
[857.52] Aashti, I am feeling very threatened, you do one thing, tell Abrash everything clearly.
[863.64] Whatever has to happen, it will happen once and for all. Yes, Rafia, I too am feeling very scared. 
[870.44] Although I told Nazrul to stop the marriage, but I don't trust him. Thats why
[877.84] I am saying that you've unnecessarily delayed the matter. Tell Abrash to
[882.56] bring his family members to your house, your parents will themselves agree, you
[886.92] think for yourself. Where is Abrash and where is Nazrul? There's a world of difference between the two
[894.04] I also think that I should tell it to Abrash. Day after tomorrow its Sunday right, I will go over and tell him
[900.96] Now you will wait for Sunday,  just call him. I am not going to talk about this on the phone,
[907.60] When I will go to his house then I will talk. Ok as per your wish, hey look isn't that your Nazr.
[922.10] Oh, what a problem! I have told him 10 times
[925.08] not to come to college, then he comes again
[929.96] Don't look over there. If I don't look then it will be a problem, I am going.
[935.04] I will come after some time, let me talk to him. Come quickly.
[940.96] [Music]
[951.04] Why did you come here, do you want to get me out of the college? Greetings
[956.76] Greetings. I came here to give you the phone, now I will teach you how to use it.
[962.44]  Nazrul, I don't want this, you go now, if the principal sees it, then
[968.60] I will be expelled from the college. Just listen to me for a minute, look at my picture, 
[974.12] I took it myself, my picture is also there, press this button, my name will come; Nazrul,
[979.72] my number is also there, whenever you feel like talking to me. Just press this button,
[984.20] then press this, then you can talk to me, hang up now, otherwise you will call. You go now.
[988.68] I know everything, go. You are looking very good today.
[1004.04] Has he gone? Yes he went, he came to give me this phone. Hey show me, this is an expensive phone
[1012.00] I don't know where he gets so much money from.
[1015.44] Must have earned it from doing shady work, do you know why he gave the phone, he says, 
[1021.72] I will talk to you on the phone all night. He's crazy. Come on, what is your business? Your work is done
[1027.88] Hey yes, my work is done, I will call Abrash sir first.
[1035.96] Yes and tell him everything. Open this, how should I dial?
[1041.56] Greetings, who is this? Yes Aashti. This is my phone; I need to talk to you about something very important
