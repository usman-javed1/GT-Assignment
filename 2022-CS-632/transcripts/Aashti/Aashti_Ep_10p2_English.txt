Zamani mother, I don't want the relationship to end.  Oh, the relationship has already ended, Noorul Amin. Your daughter has ended the relationship. No, Masood brother, relationships don't end like this. I say, get Nazrul married to my Umeeda. Nurul Amin, have you gone mad? Umeeda is 12 years old, how can she get married to Nazrul? Zamani, when I got married to Jamila, she was 13 years old. Why can it not happen? Nazrul will wait for a year then he'll marry Umeeda. Am I mad? I waited so many years for Aashti now I will wait a year for Umeeda. I will not marry Umeeda, thats it! I will only marry Aashti! Otherwise, I won't let Aashti's marriage happen anywhere else! Masood brother, I can't force her. Should I kill Aashti? I haven't gone home since yesterday. I told Jamila, if Aashti doesn't agree for marriage, then I won't come home. Now I've come to you for Umeeda, if you agree then I'll talk. Jamila will never agree Nurul Amin. I will cut off Jamila's throat! If she doesn't listen to me. Hey, don't talk rubbish! Cut of her throat. Will you kill her? Will you marry her by force? I won't do like this. I will first say to Meezan baba. He will take the right descision. Hey, I've just met Meezan baba. I told him I want to get Umeeda married. He sent me here! Ok, first you talk to Jamila Then I'll think. What are you saying! Nazrul won't agree. Marriage is not a game. He will stay with one for 4 years and then marry another. I'll talk to him, you tell me, do you agree or not? My approval won't make a difference. Nazrul won't agree. Hey Zamani, let him talk. I'll convince Nazrul. Where is Zarnish? It's been so long, she hasn't come yet. Zarnish went to the airport to pick up her friend. Abrash, should I tell you one thing? Your wife has become very ill-mannered. Mom, don't call her my wife, call her your niece.  Abrash, don't blame me. I didn't force you into marriage with her. Your preference was also included. Which friend has she gone to pick? I think its some Jimmy. The one whom she was talking to that day, I even scolded her. Then she even told you. Wow ... Nice house! Is it yours? Yes! You're going to let me drive this car? You're not going to drive it! My bag. No way! Come on Z, you've got to let me drive that car. Hello, who is this? Abrash my husband. This is your husband. Yes, he's so good-looking. Hello Abrash, nice to meet you Jimmy. I'm so jealous Z, I'm really jealous and this young Lady?  Pipi, my mother-in-Law. Hello, I'm Jimmy, nice to meet you.

Greetings! tell madam, I will come early in the morning. Hey Nurul Amin, where were you? Where did you go? I searched so many places for you, You are getting very angry for no reason.  Listen, Aashti's father, don't treat daughter like this. Aashti is our daughter. She will not be happy with Nazrul Then how will we be happy? Now because of the buses, the head of the house Will you leave the house because of the kids now? You will trouble everyone? No one will be troubled,  Only I got worried. I lost my dignity in front of everyone I slept on the footpath last night. You yourself went there,  I did not say anything,  You got worried yourself and drove me crazy too You went through the trouble yourself. Now, let go of the anger Jamila, listen to me carefully. I cannot break the relationship with Masood Bhai.  I can't tolerate my humiliation I have given a word to Zamani and Nazrul.  If Aashti doesn’t agree, I will get Umeeda married What are you saying? Don't you feel ashamed?  Umeeda is still a child Nazrul is elder than her. There's a rat in your brain If you give a word to anyone now, then I will take my life. I will not sacrifice Umeeda. Take my life, I will not give Umeeda. Kill me, take my life. Then explain it to Aashti. If she doesn't agree, I will set this house on fire I will burn everyone. What kind of man is this?  He doesn't understand anything. What should I do to fix him? Oh God, what kind of father is he?  Why did you give a daughter in this house? If all the boys had been given, this trouble wouldn't have happened. What do you mean? I had already told you that Jimmy is coming. You told me that Jimmy is coming, you did not tell what he is. It was not decided that he would stay in this house. You are talking strange things, Abrash.  Jimmy, is my friend, he has come to meet me,  where else will he stay? How can I keep a stranger in my house. Jimmy is not a stranger, I have known him for the last 10 years, I have been with him in school, college, university. I know him more as compared to you. In comparison to him, you are a stranger to me have not spent as much time with you as I have spent with him. Jimmy will stay in this house and do not interfere in my personal affairs. This is my house. I can speak on every matter of this house This house is as much yours as it is mine. Jimmy will stay in this house and remember one thing don't ever tell me what to do Zarnish ...
