[0.80] Zamani mother, I don't want the relationship to end. 
[4.59] Oh, the relationship has already ended, Noorul Amin.
[7.29] Your daughter has ended the relationship.
[13.11] No, Masood brother, relationships don't end like this.
[20.17] I say, get Nazrul married to my Umeeda.
[29.88] Nurul Amin, have you gone mad?
[33.11] Umeeda is 12 years old, how can she get married to Nazrul?
[37.08] Zamani, when I got married to Jamila, she was 13 years old.
[42.51] Why can it not happen? Nazrul will wait for a year
[45.93] then he'll marry Umeeda.
[47.60] Am I mad? I waited so many years for Aashti
[51.36] now I will wait a year for Umeeda.
[53.57] I will not marry Umeeda, thats it!
[55.60] I will only marry Aashti!
[59.70] Otherwise, I won't let Aashti's marriage happen anywhere else!
[72.47] Masood brother, I can't force her.
[77.88] Should I kill Aashti?
[80.75] I haven't gone home since yesterday.
[83.56] I told Jamila, if Aashti doesn't agree for marriage,
[86.76] then I won't come home.
[90.76] Now I've come to you for Umeeda,
[95.70] if you agree then I'll talk.
[98.40] Jamila will never agree Nurul Amin. I will cut off Jamila's throat!
[102.86] If she doesn't listen to me.
[104.87] Hey, don't talk rubbish! Cut of her throat.
[109.09] Will you kill her? Will you marry her by force?
[113.61] I won't do like this.
[115.85] I will first say to Meezan baba.
[119.34] He will take the right descision.
[121.52] Hey, I've just met Meezan baba.
[124.28] I told him I want to get Umeeda married.
[127.54] He sent me here!
[130.60] Ok, first you talk to Jamila
[136.45] Then I'll think. What are you saying!
[140.37] Nazrul won't agree. Marriage is not a game.
[144.00] He will stay with one for 4 years and then marry another.
[147.99] I'll talk to him, you tell me, do you agree or not?
[153.48] My approval won't make a difference.
[155.82] Nazrul won't agree. Hey Zamani, let him talk.
[161.76] I'll convince Nazrul.
[164.47] Where is Zarnish? It's been so long, she hasn't come yet.
[167.38] Zarnish went to the airport to pick up her friend.
[171.18] Abrash, should I tell you one thing?
[173.47] Your wife has become very ill-mannered.
[176.45] Mom, don't call her my wife, call her your niece. 
[179.51] Abrash, don't blame me.
[182.24] I didn't force you into marriage with her.
[184.88] Your preference was also included.
[188.61] Which friend has she gone to pick?
[190.81] I think its some Jimmy.
[192.76] The one whom she was talking to that day, I even scolded her.
[196.24] Then she even told you.
[217.21] Wow ... Nice house!
[220.32] Is it yours? Yes!
[222.79] You're going to let me drive this car? You're not going to drive it!

[364.16] Coming, have some patience. Greetings!
[371.72] Where is Aashti? She has not come. 
[373.33] Zarnish madam guest has come from London.
[376.36] She said that Aashti will not come tonight. 
[378.27] She sent me to say this. Okay, fine. today. Greetings!
[381.24] Greetings! tell madam, I will come early in the morning.
[385.96] Hey Nurul Amin, where were you?
[394.12] Where did you go? I searched so many places for you,
[401.04] You are getting very angry for no reason. 
[406.02] Listen, Aashti's father, don't treat daughter like this.
[412.09] Aashti is our daughter. She will not be happy with Nazrul
[417.52] Then how will we be happy? Now because of the buses, the head of the house
[421.00] Will you leave the house because of the kids now?
[425.20] You will trouble everyone? No one will be troubled, 
[429.04] Only I got worried. I lost my dignity in front of everyone
[432.60] I slept on the footpath last night. You yourself went there,
[438.01]  I did not say anything, 
[440.12] You got worried yourself and drove me crazy too
[443.05] You went through the trouble yourself. Now, let go of the anger
[447.65] Jamila, listen to me carefully.
[451.06] I cannot break the relationship with Masood Bhai.
[455.13]  I can't tolerate my humiliation
[456.16] I have given a word to Zamani and Nazrul. 
[462.12] If Aashti doesn’t agree, I will get Umeeda married
[467.60] What are you saying? Don't you feel ashamed? 
[474.01] Umeeda is still a child
[477.14] Nazrul is elder than her. There's a rat in your brain
[482.28] If you give a word to anyone now, then I will take my life.
[489.44] I will not sacrifice Umeeda. Take my life, I will not give Umeeda.
[496.20] Kill me, take my life.
[504.37] Then explain it to Aashti. If she doesn't agree, I will set this house on fire
[511.00] I will burn everyone.
[522.20] What kind of man is this? 
[527.85] He doesn't understand anything. What should I do to fix him?
[530.59] Oh God, what kind of father is he? 
[535.16] Why did you give a daughter in this house?
[539.60] If all the boys had been given, this trouble wouldn't have happened.
[545.03] What do you mean? I had already told you that Jimmy is coming.
[549.16] You told me that Jimmy is coming, you did not tell what he is.
[554.24] It was not decided that he would stay in this house.
[556.01] You are talking strange things, Abrash. 
[558.64] Jimmy, is my friend, he has come to meet me, 
[560.01] where else will he stay? How can I keep a stranger in my house.
[563.08] Jimmy is not a stranger, I have known him for the last 10 years,
[567.72] I have been with him in school, college, university. I know him
[572.44] more as compared to you.
[575.02] In comparison to him, you are a stranger to me
[578.00] have not spent as much time with you as I have spent with him.
[580.06] Jimmy will stay in this house and do not interfere in my personal affairs.
[586.07] This is my house. I can speak on every matter of this house
[589.32] This house is as much yours as it is mine.
[593.00] Jimmy will stay in this house and
[594.96] remember one thing don't ever tell me what to do
[600.84] Zarnish ... Zarnish ...

[724.84] Baba, you know everything. 
[731.28] It's been 4 years since our engagement, and now she says
[736.96] that she will not marry me. I only want Aashti. I know everything.
[744.68] Her mother is supporting her,
[746.02] You are right that only her mother supports her.
[749.80] Do anything to get her married to me. Do a miracle that she wants
[755.84] to marry me. Do it quickly. I don't have time. If you to hurry up,
[761.84] the work won't be done so quickly, a lot of money will be spent.
[765.01] Don't worry about money. The more you ask, the more you'll get
[769.84] Don't worry, just be fast. Ok, what is the name of the girl?
[776.76] Aasti, ok, I will blow prayers over the water and give it to you
[784.88] Give the girl water to drink by any means. I will make her drink.
[790.28] If you want your work to be done quickly, 
[794.03] you’ll have to bring these things.
[795.92] What I have to bring? A piece of black owl's flesh
[800.44] four lion nails, a pot of monkey face. 
[807.01]  
[809.48] Where will I find these strange things? 
[812.18] They are not available in the market. If you have money, what can't you get?
[816.05] I will tell you the address, bring everything from there.
[821.88] The sooner you bring them, the sooner the ritual will be performed
[825.32] You will marry your Aashti within seven days.
[841.68] Okay, your work will be done.
[844.00]  If you do this, I will make you happy.
[848.36] Now just tell me the address, I will go immediately.
[856.69]  [Music] 
[883.77] Greetings! where is baba?
