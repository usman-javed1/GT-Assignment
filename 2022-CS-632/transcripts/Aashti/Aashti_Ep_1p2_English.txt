Mother, you don't feel insulted, but I do. Have you gone mad? She always says such things. If Sir and Mr. Abrash werenâ€™t here, I would never have worked here neither let you do it. Keep quiet, if madam heard you, she would kick us out, then what will we do? From where you will eat? How will you study? Leave this, I will do it myself, you start cleaning. You will never stop favoring these penniless people. Hey Sherry, no man is poor or rich, They have been employee of ours for 10 years, they are trustworthy you will get more employees, but you can't trust someone and leave house on them. When these people came here 10 years ago, there was no trust on them too. You gain trust with the time. Such honest women are rarely found, they are trustworthy. You read everyday incidents in newspapers. Sherry, I am not saying that you should not scold, but not in such a way that a person starts feeling insulted. Aashti ... Hey Aashti ...  I am coming mother after cleaning sir's room, What are you doing? I have come to clean your room. Okay! You must wear this saree. Why don't you wear saree?

Zamani mother told me that you are very beautiful, just like a fairy. I did not believe it at first. You know what I did? What you did?
