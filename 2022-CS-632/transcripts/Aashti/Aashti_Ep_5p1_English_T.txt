[2.28] Sir, you have caused yourself a lot of trouble by coming here. Come in.
[7.84] Come, come.
[12.92] Greeting, Abrash sir. Greetings! what am I hearing Aashti?
[18.08] After studying for the whole year, you won't give the exam?
[22.24] Wouldn't all your hard work go to waste? How much loss is this?
[30.64] That's ok, my benefit is nowhere. 
[36.00] Madam is correct, 
[38.23] what will we maids get after getting educated?
[42.23] Isnâ€™t it just sweeping, mopping, and cooking? 
[45.76] What are you talking about?
[47.60] In one day all your views have changed, 
[51.31] all your thinking has changed.
[53.64] Life changes in one breath. 
[59.53] Come on Aashti, stop it now, 
[62.98] Abrash sir is absolutely right.
[66.49] He has spent so much money on your education 
[69.67] and now when it's time to give your exam
[71.52] you are not giving the exam. 
[73.53] It's going to be such a loss of money for Abrash sir.
[76.53] It's not about the money, Jamila. 
[78.70] It's about her future, her passion.
[86.24] Now, neither the future remains nor the passion. 
[91.89] You had promised me that you will do graduation,
[95.20]  now there is no need to talk about this nonsense,
[97.50]  you will fulfill your promise and give the exam,
[100.69]  do you understand? Now you don't have to say anything, be quiet.
[105.83] Did you go the doctor? Nurul Amin brought the medicines.
[110.90] How can you take medicine without showing it to a doctor. 
[113.85] Come on, I will take you to the doctor,
[116.15] Come on, let's go. No Abrash sir, I will get fine.
[122.95] You cannot get better without seeing a doctor 
[126.28] and you have to get well because
[128.96] my mehndi is on Saturday, wedding on Sunday,
[132.22]  if you don't come, it won't be nice.
[135.84] Then what will happen? I won't get married.
[141.72] No Abrash sir, Aashti will definitely come to your wedding.
[148.84] You don't feel like seeing me becoming a groom? 
[154.60]  I will come. I have a great desire to see you become groom.
[163.53] So at least come to fulfill your desire. Come on, 
[166.58] now I will take you to the doctor, come on.
[168.95] I am sitting outside, you get ready, ok.
[174.03] [Bangla Song]
[212.12] How is it? It's very beautiful
[216.97] Where did you get money from? 
[221.00] When I asked you for money day before yesterday, 
[223.72] you said you don't have money. 
[225.60] Now you have money for wife's saree. 
[228.36] Day before yesterday I had no money.
[231.41] Today, I got a job, I also got advance. 
[236.66] Now you have realized value of wife
[239.71] Now live happily with your wife.
[243.66]  You can get sorrow without asking 
[246.53] but happiness cannot be received without asking.
[249.38] Do you understand? Mother,
[252.95]  now quickly arrange for Nazrul brother's marriage as well
[256.80] Sister Aashti will come here, then our hearts will be at ease. 
[260.15] He also has a twisted mind,
[262.80] I will have to force him too, then he will agree.
[268.20] The colors very nice.
[272.95] What are you indicating about? Who did it?
[278.24] You're lying! Aqeela you tell me, 
[283.80] what was he indicating about.
[286.16] Mother, Saeed is saying let's go out for an outing.
[295.33] Oh, you will go for an outing.
[300.80] If you go now, then when will you come back? 
[303.71] We will come back early, you don't worry. 
[307.06] Ok, come back early, don't be late.
[309.71] Ok, we will come early
[311.19] Mother, I will go and get ready quickly.
[318.80] Mother, I will also go and change my clothes. Go
[332.23] [Music]
[340.77] You've never been to Karachi's beach. 
[343.54] There's also a very big sea in my Bangladesh. 
[346.68] They also have a lot of storms too.
[348.68] Floods don't come here, we just came  to roam around the sea 
[358.27]  [Music]
[395.08] I took a picture of famous heroine, and the hero 
[399.56] and sister your picture will also turn out great
[402.15]  and so will yours Aswell. Then you will 
[406.12] put such a big picture in your house, then you will remember me, 
[409.41] trust me. Come here, sit here.
[411.77] Sister, you come sit here, come on
[413.84] Should we get our picture taken?
[418.49] Sister, just look in front
[426.80] A little in front, look a bit here.
[434.48] Smile a little
[440.52] Smile a little brighter.
[444.80] Wow, she is looking exactly like a heroine.
[450.02] Now, wait a minute, Aqeela, put on your veil. 
[453.96] Now take the photo.
[456.00]  If the face gets hidden, then how will I take the photo
[460.52] What do you have to do with the face? You take your picture.
[464.68] But then what would be the use of taking the picture in it? 
[468.27] What am I telling you? If you want a face,
[470.44]  then I will not get the picture taken. Come on, Aqeela, get up.
[472.92]  No, no, sit, I will take the picture.
[477.64] Aha! Let's go Aqeela.
[483.28] Sir. How much? Rs 100
[489.32] You liked it right Aqeela? I also liked it very much.
[494.48] Zamani mother told us to come early, now she must be waiting.
[500.44] What does she know about how much fun we had.
[504.00] Hey, what are you doing, how will you count so much money? 
[507.97] Check if they are complete.
[510.70] I will count it, come tomorrow at 4:00 pm in the evening. 
[517.86] Don't bring much stuff, only two pieces of cloth, 
[521.44] half kg roasted chickpeas, half kg brown sugar and a packet of toffee.
[525.18]  After climbing the mountain, the throat gets dry 
[527.06] so the toffee will come in handy
[528.42] Do you get it? Yes, I understand.
[530.36] No one's relative will come here to drop them off 
[535.26] and come on time. Whoever's left will be left.
[538.80]  Then Anwar Bhai and I won't be responsible
[542.39] Don't wear lungi, wear pants like this otherwise,
[546.17]  this too will remain on the way, understand? 
[549.32] Okay, we will come tomorrow in the morning.
[552.47] Now everyone has to go to Europe now, 
[555.04] make preparations, go and sit with your family,
[557.40]  give them some time, you don't know when you will return.
[560.08] Now you will go to Europe, there will be cold air, you will get fair.
[565.76] Anwar Bhai, give me my commission. 
[570.32] Hey, you're in such a hurry to get the commission.
[573.84]  When it comes to money everyone hurries. 
[578.62] Here, take this, it complete. 
[582.84]  25k? It's complete amount. 
[587.16] Now all these people will reach right, 
[589.87] there won't be any cheating or anything?
[591.84] How will I do cheat? If I cheat once, 
[595.45] then how will I eat later. I have sent 22 people
[598.57] to Europe, everyone has reached.
[601.51]  I am just asking, if a problem occurs 
[603.86] then it would be trouble for us.
[605.54] I don't do wrong work; I don't slaughter chickens; 
[609.96] I only eat eggs, now I will go, my work is done. 
[619.92] [Sings]

[669.30] and this is for Aashti's saree.

[677.60] He gave this for Shaan and Hasnain, where are they?
[681.58]  They went out to play.
[684.00] Jamila, how did he give so much money just like this? 
[688.17] Because of Abrash sir he gave, 
[690.00] he said bring Nurul Amin to the wedding as well.

[696.37] we will eat for at least 2 days, hurry up! heat it fast, go.

[806.00] I know how much hard work you do, 
[810.00] your hand and feet are not used to labor.
[812.73] I work with my brain; now my luck is on high level.
