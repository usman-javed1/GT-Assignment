[0.40] This girl has come from another country, she has left her home, has
[6.64] left her family. Her family, her
[14.72] house, are these people. You are her everything. She used to work
[23.12] for the sake of her food, all
[28.16] women in our Bengali community work to make ends meet
[36.08] She was alone with mother; what else could she do for the sake of her stomach?
[41.80] You were giving him something to her?
[46.68] Whatever happened, happened. Now she has no connections with her Boss
[53.67] Divorce is a very bad thing.
[58.66] In our religion, giving divorce is considered very bad
[64.88] Allah gets angry, the Prophet is not happy, and the devil is very happy,
[73.36] Being unkind weakens faith. You will say don't work, she won't work,
[83.68] If you ask her to cover herself, she will do so. Aqeela is a very good girl.
[92.08] Now you will understand, okay. Do one thing, go
[98.80] in your room. Come on ... Go!
[113.28] Zamani, do one thing
[117.76] leave Aqeela for few days at Jamila's house, he will cool down, he just had fight
[126.68] don't bring her back now. Otherwise, he will again fight. Once he will realize then bring her back
[134.00] Now, I am leaving
[146.44] Walikum salam. 
[152.02] Don't worry, everything will be fine. Saeed is kind-hearted, and I don't know why he's saying that.
[165.40] I used to work, I did not commit any sin, How can I fill my stomach? 
[173.68] My mother was sick, and I had to get her treatment. If I hadn't paid the rent, where would I have stayed?
[185.12] My boss was like my father. He give me everything because my father died.
[193.76] He did wrong? An old man, very old man, father of five. All grown up kids.
[204.76] His wife made dresses for me. He is harsh with me for no reason
[214.48] I am innocent. Now be quiet, how long will you cry? Allah will fix everything
[221.56] How long you will cry?
[225.24] Saeed is angry at me. Saeed will be fine.
[229.74] Aqeela, you are still crying?
[234.16] My child, quite now. You neither slept at night nor during the day. Did not had food in afternoon, still has not
[241.84] eaten, quite now. Aashti, bring something for her to eat. Okay mother.
[248.04] Don't cry, it's okay, just
[254.64] listen to me, see, it happens, you have fight with husbands, why are you crying.
[261.44] I haven't done anything. I know you haven't done anything.

[320.29] Make a small net. Masood Bhai, this
[323.08] is a small trap, if you make it smaller, it will cause trouble, it is forbidden, if anyone
[327.96] sees it then? Hey, who will see? If someone tells, it will be from one of us
[335.40] If you don't make the net smaller, how will you catch the fish? How we will make money?
[342.68] The Chinese trawler that is standing in the sea, it takes all the fish, either big or small
[350.96] no one asks them. Government has closed its eyes,
[359.80] Whoever comes from outside as a fisherman, takes our fish, no one ask. Now be quick
[368.68] Now we will catch fish on this net.
[378.16] In big net, how many fishes we can catch?
[384.40] Four! only four!
[392.88] If someone betrays, I will tie them up with this net and throw them into the sea
[401.08] Did you understand? Yes!
[428.31] Rafia, I decided that now I will not come
[432.04] to college but Abrash Sir said. What he said? He must have said long dialogues. No, he said,
[441.08] you are studying for my sake; you are doing this all for me and said, don't cry now.
[447.20] You were crying? Yes, I felt insulted, I
[453.68] started crying right there, do you know Rafia, Abrash, you wiped my tears with his hand.
[460.92] What a romantic scene it will be. Well, tell me further, then what happened next? On the way,
[467.48] he asked me when will you come home and said, don't do cleaning and mopping any more. I said, I
[473.84] will clean your room. Honestly Rafia, it feels good to do his work.
[483.20] I wish that day never end. But you have fianc√© also, what
[492.52] was his name, Nazar ... Nazrul Islam. I don't like him even a bit,
[498.96] perhaps I will never marry him, I will marry
[505.48] only Abrash sir and I am sure
[510.08] that Abrash sir loves me a lot and he will convince his parents. I am only
[518.64] afraid of his mother, Sherry Alam. By the way, marriage is not fun unless
[525.84] there is adventure and suspense. Arrange marriages are boring. 
[532.24] Whereas your marriage will be full of suspense, excitement and
[542.80] adventure. You know what will happen. Abrah's mother will say
[548.48] No, this marriage cannot happen, then you know what Abrash will do. He will climb walls of his house
[555.56] will come straight to your house and you know what he will say to you, let's run away
[564.76] and then you both will go for the court marriage and after that
[570.00] you will become his bride. Nothing like this will happen, nor will he run away, neither me. Rafia, 
[578.96] pray for me that a miracle happen that I go and settle down in his house.
[593.60] Asalam alikum ... Walikum Asalam. Look, your mother's
[601.92] pictures have been printed in almost eight newspapers and all the seminars' details are written too. Good!
[608.12] Every day someone is after me to come as the chief guest of the seminar, but
[612.04] you know that I do not have time. Ali Alam, if you had come to the seminar,
[618.76] you would have known how much I am being praised there and many reputable ladies
[623.16] were there, by the way Shaista had also come. If you had told me that so many 
[628.80] ladies are coming and especially Miss Shaista, I would have left all the work and
[633.52] reached there. Do you come there just for Shaista?. I swear to God,
[639.36] just for you. Ali Alam, do you remember how many interviews I had when the earthquake happened
[645.48] in newspapers, even BBC had interviewed me, I had also given
[650.16] an interview to them, I don't know when it will come on-air. Mom, tell me one thing, when Baba and I sit at home and
[658.24] talk about business, you feel bad. You start scolding us that
[662.32] why do you people sit at home and talk about business and you yourself are talking about NGO.
[665.32] You should feel proud son that your mother is praised so much. But you
[671.08] yourself have said that there should be some different talks in the house too. I have some
[674.88] different things to talk. Really, you have some different things to talk? 
[680.16] Tahir Brother and his wife are coming from London. I had completely forgotten, I
[686.00] will call them after having tea. Abrash, do read the interview of this newspaper, it
[690.96] has all the details about my seminar tomorrow. Mummy, I will read but,
[697.04] tell me one thing. Yes, ask. You took Aashti with you. Hey, you took Aashti with you?
[707.20] Yes Baba, Mummy took her along with her too and in front of the people and the press, 
[712.32] she introduced her that she sweeps our house and that she
[718.36] also teaching Aashti. So, what wrong did I do? Did I lie? Mom, she is studying herself,
[724.96] you are not teaching and then that in front of people calling her and telling that
[729.36] she sweeps ... It means that Aashti has complained about me to you. No, she has
[735.20] not complained. I myself was asking her what happened at that event and she
[739.12] was saying. Okay, don't give justifications to me.
[743.52] I understand everything
[756.83] I am not coming tomorrow. Why? It's my cousin's
[758.88] birthday. How old is she? She is nine, she is so cute, I will bring her to meet you
[764.92] Yes, definitely bring her. I buy a teddy bear for her.
[769.88] Your Majno is again here. Asalamalikum
[776.88] how many times have I refused you, don't come to my college, you come again.
[782.04] Hey, why are you getting angry, look I borrowed motorcycle from my friend, I will take you
[785.80] around the whole city, now let's go to the park. You are crazy, I am not going with you.
[791.72] You said to me you will go after the wedding, that day I brought the locket, you refused, said,
[796.68] I will take it when you will become my husband, now I will do one thing, I will go immediately and
[803.56] tell mother to marry me tomorrow to Aashti. No, No okay, by the way,
[808.52] Nazrul, these days you have started teasing me. Don't delay, I have to go 
[814.84] with mother somewhere, then if I get late from college then father gets very angry. Oh,
[819.84] that's why I am saying that you should marry me quickly, then neither your father will be angry, nor
[824.80] my father will be angry, nor our father's father will be angry. Now sit.
[830.76] Don't let me fall. Hold on to me and sit. I am very scared. There
[836.24] is nothing to be afraid of. Hold me.
[842.21] I will fall. You won't. Hold me tightly
[847.88] [Song]
[855.36] [Song]
[866.84] [Song]
[875.96] Give her something to eat, will you let her go hungry?
[882.03] Here you go, cold ice cream. It's very tasty, try it.
[885.80] Hey Nazrul, I did not say to you to bring. Hey, what are you talking about? Listen to me
[894.28] A good husband gives his wife everything without asking
[901.92] I have already eaten, it's very tasty. Shall I tell you one thing, last night I had a dream
[909.08] You came in my dream, I saw you
[915.76] In my dream, you were softly running your fingers through my hair to wake me, talking sweetly,
[921.72] to me, I liked it very much. If it happens in real, it would be
[928.32] so nice. You will make tea for me. Sometimes you will fight also with me. 
[935.12] You will also talk sweetly. I am going to say to mother to arrange our marriage immediately.
[940.01] Nazrul, again you have started talking nonsense. Right now, you are jobless you are roaming all day.
[948.72] Eight months are left in my exams, should I leave my degree incomplete? Hey,
[956.92] when I said this, you can complete your degree after marriage too.
[962.24] You know nothing about the job, wherever I go, they ask for ID card and you
[967.84] know that we are Bengalis and ID cards are not issued to us.
[971.68] You know how to cook? Chinese Pakistani and many more, you teach me.
[978.00] I'll go to a big hotel and will become ...
[984.04] Cook. Nazrul, I don't know how to cook.
[990.16] Now let's go, I am getting late. Why are you in such a hurry? Let's go there.
[995.80] in the water, it will be fun. No, I don't want to go. I have to go with mother at boss house.
[1000.76] I am getting late, let's go quickly. First you promise, you will come again with me.
[1008.36] I will come again. Finish the ice cream first. I don't want to eat. If you are not eating,
[1016.48] then I am also not eating. Let's go home. Okay, let's go. Give this to me. No, I can hold.
[1024.48]  
[1027.52] [Song]
[1035.66] [Song] 
[1044.44] Haye, I am going.
[1065.52] You know, I go in the morning at work.
[1073.40] I comes at 12 o'clock in the night, you know, when the order of furniture comes, sir says
[1081.40] finish it otherwise he deducts money and Jamila says to me that you are not working.
[1088.28] Noor ul Amin inflation is increased, what shall we do?
[1096.00] The woman is crying in every house. Masood brother
[1101.76] I want Aashti's wedding to be arranged soon, you give one final date.
[1110.56] Nurul Amin, I used to think that you yourself are delaying
[1114.84] as her degree in not completed yet. Jamila said to me, exams are not done.
[1124.62] Masood brother, enough of her exams. Now, you bring the wedding procession and take her.
[1134.70] Zamani said to me many times, even Nazrul also said to me. But I said to them to wait
[1144.20] Now you are saying then Okay. I'll talk to Zamani. You start preparation from your side.
[1152.56] Our preparations are complete!
