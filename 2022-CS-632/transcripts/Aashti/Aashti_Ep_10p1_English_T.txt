[1.21] Hello, how are you?
[5.48] What's this? Sari, a gift for you.
[11.26] Sari.
[16.00] What will I do with it? You know I don't wear sari.
[20.49] I know, but it's my choice. I don't like it.
[25.88] Wear it for my sake, please?
[28.84] I won't wear it! Give it to the one who wears it.
[31.89] [Music]
[43.08] Aashti, you take this sari. 
[47.70] Take it, it will look very good on you.
[49.81] Anyway you look very good in sari.
[51.72] Take, keep it!
[57.05] Take it, it's a very nice sari, keep it, wear it.
[62.38] [Music]
[69.40] Do you know what? I was just thinking about how
[72.92] quickly we realised how different we are.
[78.96] It's good that we recognised it early.
[82.43] [Music]
[93.88] Look Zamani, I will reach on time,
[97.61] We will finalize the marriage date according to our will
[101.56] But we will take the date as per our wish.
[107.40] Amma, I am ready now, let’s go! Nazrul hasn’t arrived yet
[112.06] are we supposed to go empty-handed now?
[115.08] How can we go empty-handed? You’ll take these sweets with you.
[119.63] I brought rasgullas—Aashti loves them.
[122.64] Amma, don’t take too long a date
[127.16] I have to get married in this month, that's it, 
[129.77] I know exactly what to do
[133.80] But you won’t leave the house 
[135.91] If you leave, you won’t get married. And no messing around either!
[138.92] If you cause any trouble, I’ll break your legs.
[143.81] Listen, after marriage, no nonsense!
[148.84] Oh no, Dad, I won’t cause any trouble! 
[151.02] I just talked to the furniture shop.
[154.32] There’s a salesman there who offered me a salary of 4,000 rupees.
[159.13] I’ll work there and live peacefully, that’s it
[163.04] We’ll see how peacefully you live
[167.07] Hurry up now, we’re getting late! Remember mother, this month
 
[175.28] Don't delay. Go fast. 
[183.32] [Bangla Song]
[203.51] Aqeela ...
[207.63] Aqeela ...
[213.54] Mom ...
[216.28] Aqeela ...
[222.21] Where is Aqeela?
[226.24] Where is Mom? Why are you singing?
[230.98] My choice—whether I sing or dance,
[236.69] Stop singing!
[240.79] This is a very valuable and expensive saree with beautiful color.
[247.50]  Do you know, Shabnum, Abrash Sir is not happy with Zarnish.
[252.43] I find my judgment to be accurate
[254.44] Zarnish's mother forced her into marriage
[257.00] This saree is so beautiful and valuable
[260.84] Abrash Sir brought for Zarnish and Zarnish refused. 
[265.31] And then he gave you?
[267.32] Such precious sari? 
[270.01] Aashti, it looks like you're making a place for yourself
[274.15] By the Shabnum, I too feel like this. 
[279.25] It seems that my trust which was broken is being rebuilt.
[282.28] To me, that house feels like my home, my real one.
[287.66] May Allah make it happen
[289.68] May it be like this, I always pray this, Aashti sister, Amma is calling you.
[297.96] Why? Masood uncle and Zamani maa are here
[301.01] to fix your wedding date. Come Quick!
[307.88] 18th of the month is, okay? Masood, Jamila is saying for the 18th?
[314.72] Yes, 18th is fine.
[317.72] Zamani, we want to get them married soon. 
[320.09] I say the same, do it quickly. It will lighten the burden on my head
[326.44] Congratulations, 18th is the final wedding date.
[329.44] Hey Zamani, which sweet will you eat? I will have Gulab Jamun.
[335.64] I don't want to marry a loafer like Nazrul. All of you listen,
[343.96] I will not marry under any circumstances, even if you kill me
[349.01] How can she refuse to marry? I will marry her at any cost.
[353.20] Narul Amin is right, Jamila, have spoiled the girl.
[358.08] He had said not to educate the girl too much 
[360.85] otherwise, she gets influenced by the ways of the world.
[362.82] See how fearless she is, she stood in front of everyone
[365.88] She knocked the sweet out of my hand.
[367.52] This is not game. I’ll talk myself. Hey Nazrul, you will not go there.
[373.53] We are not so desperate that we would go and beg for marriage
[378.30] The disrespect won’t be ours; it will be on the girl’s side
[383.14] Tell Mijan Baba, he has given us his words. 
[385.57] How Noor uncle can refuse him?
[388.60] It’s not Noor ul Amin who refused, it’s Aashti who refused
[391.38] That girl has gone mad. She says, 'I’ll give up my life
[395.40] but won’t marry
[398.60] Why does he take out Aashti's anger on us?
[402.79] Kill me, but I still won’t marry Nazrul.
[407.79] I will die but never marry Nazrul.
[410.64] Leave her. I won't leave her. I will kill her.
[418.72] So many years have passed, and by saying no
[422.00] she made us feel humiliated, I warned you again and again 
[427.01] not to send her out, but you didn’t pay attention. I won't spare her!
[431.64] She has gone crazy. Why are you standing here? Go inside.
[435.14] This girl has gone crazy, and she has made me crazy too
[438.16] forgive me, forgive her, she has gone mad.
[443.65] If she has gone crazy, send her to the asylum but will kill her.
[449.84] If you kill her, you too will definitely go to jail. 
[453.03] I will go, I will definitely go to jail
[455.36] If the need arises, I will even hang myself. But I will not leave her.
[461.44] Forgive me and her too. I will talk to her Nooral Amin. I will
[467.12] Jamila, I will not step into this house until
[474.84] she agrees to marry, I will not come back
[480.44] I am leaving now!
[483.48] Nurul Amin! I won't come back home now!
[488.07] I've gone mad!
[492.49] You've already made me crazy, humiliated me, and caused my disgrace
[495.78] and caused my disgrace. What did you do like this? Tell me!
[500.68] Hey Umeeda, you go outside, go!
[507.90] Aashti, why are you doing like this?
[511.74] Now even Abrash is married.
[514.80] Now, whose love are you going crazy for?
[517.22] Why have you become an enemy of your life, Aashti?
[520.22] You've made your father gone mad as well.
[524.83] Mom, I won't marry.
[528.00] I won't get married with anyone.
[531.28] Yes, you'll spend your entire life living in your father's house.
[536.85] You'll feed on your father's earnings.
[539.69] No mom, I will earn.
[545.27] I will not marry. Aashti, why are you doing like this!
[549.27] Why have you become an enemy of your life, Aashti?
[552.24] If your father hears this, he'll kill you!
[556.26] He'll kill me too! I will die.
[559.34] Aashti, have mercy, for God's sake have mercy.
[562.98] My child, why are you doing like this?
[572.68] Zarnish, do you know I find the ocean very mysterious.
[581.42] Have you ever seen rain in the open sea?
[584.95] No, I've never seen it.
[588.53] I also like the sea, I find it very fascinating.
[594.45] I'm glad you took some time out to bring me here. 
[601.61]  I don't understand why we are letting these small things
[604.79] create distance between us.
[606.80] For you, they might be small things, but not for me!
[611.44] Abrash, what do I do? Sit at home and wait for you.
[616.53] Like a typical housewife, I don't want to be a typical housewife!
[622.81] You do your work, do your activities
[626.01] and me? I just wait for you.
[629.76] What activities do I do? I have no activities,
[632.68] It's just business, of course I have to work. 
[635.67] I myself want to roam with you, come out with you, spend time
[638.82] with you. Whenever we get time, we will go on a trip.
[643.29] Don't talk about roaming around, I'm not interested in that.
[647.25] All I want is some company I hate being alone!
[651.08] I've been surrounded my friends, all of my life. Ok 
[655.76] Done, shall we go out?
[660.64] Come on, come out.
[663.35] [Music]
[675.43] What a place, man! The open sky, the free air, the blue sea.
[682.16] These are the things that make a person forget everything.
[686.78] Come on, let us both promise, alright?
[690.00] We promise that no matter what happens,
[694.33] we will never end our love. What did
[698.21] We had imagined that after marriage, we would stay together, 
[702.51] enjoy life.
[705.51] But what are we doing? We're fighting.
[707.65] We've been fighting since so many days.
[711.10] Now let's decide that we'll never fight again.
[716.65] Ok, now lets promise each other we'll never fight.
[722.40] Now we both with take care of each other,
[724.22] take care of each other's choices.
[727.03] You will do what I want and I will do what you want.
[731.59] Because I don't want to be separated from you.
[734.22] Don't you want that? If I wanted that, I wouldn't have married you.
[741.98] I have some expectations, if they're not fulfilled, then
[747.29] this distance will keep on increasing.
[750.65] If they are fulfilled, then there will be no distance between us.
[758.04] Whatever your expectations are, I will try to fulfill them completely.
[762.73] Alright, I'll try my level best. Promise? Promise.
[768.78] Hey Nazrul, now be quiet.
[776.16] Aashti, betrayed me.
[779.08] I waited so many years for her
[782.84] Now she says she won't marry me.
[786.99] Mujeeb brother, how can I live without Aashti?
[791.15] What type of a man are you? You're crying, bastard.
[795.65] People say that we will kidnap the girl, kill her.
[800.14] You're crying like a child.
[803.37] You've never loved someone, if you had loved like I did
[808.24] then you'd cry too. I don't cry.
[811.95] What’s the point of such love where men end up in tears?
[815.70] Tell me one thing, you were engaged to Aashti,
[821.17] you used to give her gifts,
[823.36] she was happy, then why did she refuse now?
[827.65] I don't know anything, why she refused.
[831.85] You're an absolute fool! There must be a reason why she refused.
[836.78] Think, think!
[840.45] Don't cry.
[843.70] Noor uncle is nowhere to be found, I searched the entire neighborhood.
[846.98] I checked every single house; he's not even in the mosque.
[849.99] Arshad, he must be here somewhere, he didn't come home last night.
[854.39] He was not feeling well as well.
[856.56] Ask his friend Shadab and let me know.
[860.63] Thank you. Shadab uncle is not here as well.
[863.61] He went to fishery, I said at his house,
[866.60] if he comes home then send him, he'll come to you.
[869.63] Thank you, Arshad, you do look for him, find him, ok?
[874.50] Ok, I'll find go and find him, bye.
[896.08] Hey Jamila, did Nurul Amin come?
[900.00] No Razia, I'm getting very worried now.
[904.29] I couldn't sleep the entire night.
[907.01] This father and daughter have made me crazy.
[909.70] Now, how can I get Aashti married forcefully?
[914.09] No Jamila, forced marriage is not lawful.
[917.77] The girl's consent is necessary.
[920.38] Who will make Nurul Amin understand this, he doen't understand.
[924.73] He says that he'll force her marriage.
[927.96] No, marriage does not happen by force, then divorce happens.
[932.16] Divorce is not a good thing.
[935.67] Now, I'm going I'll come again to meet you.
[939.37] If you find Nurul brother, then do let me know.
[941.88] I'll tell you. God will fix all this.
[946.30] Everything will be fine, bye!
[953.16] Hey Shaan, go close the door.
[956.67] Why are you here?
[958.10] After humiliating us so much, why are you sitting here now?
[962.99] Zamani mother, I don't want the relationship to end. 
[966.33] Oh, the relationship has already ended, Noorul Amin.
[969.08] Your daughter has ended the relationship.
[975.16] No, Masood brother, relationships don't end like this.
[982.01] I say, get Nazrul married to my Umeeda.
