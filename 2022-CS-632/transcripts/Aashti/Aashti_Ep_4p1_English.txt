Saeed, you swear on me, you will not go outside, you will say nothing to brother, Nazrul.  If you hadn’t sworn on your head, Aqeela, I would’ve taken off my slipper and hit him on his face.  Hey!

[Music] [Crying] Aashti, what happened? Why are you crying? Mother, why did Abrash sir get engaged? He was ... Aashti! have you gone mad? You think like this? Why, is it wrong for me to think and how much does he care about me? He wanted to marry me. Have you gone mad? Don't say such a thing! Abrash will marry you? You are a servant, a servant, a maid, we can sweep and mop the floor of that house, but but we can’t walk around acting like the lady of the house. Are you thinking of settling in that bungalow? Aashti, you refused to marry Nazrul because of him? Abrash cares about you, he made you study, not because he wants to marry you. Only because he will earn reward. Aashti, these big people do nothing except for their own benefit.  Mother, Abrash is not like this, he told me that he would give me happiness. He gave you the happiness, right? He can't give you more happiness than this. Aashti Our eyes are small, very small We can't have big dreams. These big people, you know can fill our pockets with money, but not with happiness Do you understand? You will die crying, still, you won't get him You won't get anything. Till now, 15 men have been sent there, they enjoy themselves over there. Will there be any trouble? If the police caught us? The police don't arrest anyone there. The person who leaves from here becomes a refugee. What is a refugee?  I will explain it to you. Whoever goes from here, his passport ID card is fake It can only be used while going from Pakistan to Iran. Then when the time comes to leave Iran he burns the passport and ID card, then Anwar Bhai's agent gives it to the Turkish agent, then the Turkish one gives it to the European agent , then you will have to pay Rs. 3.5 lakh, he will take the money, make your documents and put you on work. No worries, just be energetic Did you understand anything? Now tell you want to go or not? I have to go, for sure. First tell me, how many people have you gathered? Six are confirmed. In a day or two, I think that there will be one or two people. Everyone says that the money is too much. Then leave this. 4 lakhs seem too much, then leave the Europe, die here in Pakistan. Hey Saleemullah, handle him. Please sit, where are you going. You’re having a conversation that’s wasting time I have to send more people, tell me now whether you want to go or not?  I want to go. I have already discussed with them.  They are waiting for me. Nazar said, it will take 50k. 50% off. Okay, you go and bring the money, give it to Nazrul, even fake documents cost money, understand? Go now. Okay, I left in one way and returned in another.  I left in one way and returned in another. He doesn’t have money, but he wants to go to Europe [Laughter] Put the ring on Abrash ... Congratulations!
