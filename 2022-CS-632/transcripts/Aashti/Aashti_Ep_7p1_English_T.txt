[2.37] [Music]
[20.02]  Even when I don't talk to you,
[22.04] you feel as if I have said something? 
[26.52] I feel like when we silently look at each other, 
[29.21] it’s as if we are making a promise of love to each other.
[36.30] All I know is that I’ve never loved 
[40.13] anyone as much as I love you.
[43.07]  I really enjoy being with you—going out,  
[46.12] spending time together,
[47.69] laughing, and making you laugh.
[51.14] Life was never as beautiful as it seems today.
[58.00]  See that mountain over there?
[62.40] I want to climb its highest peak with you 
[65.17] and look at the world from there
[69.46] Lets go
[156.73] [Applause]
[167.79] You people saw this movie, do you like it?
[171.04] Very good!
[173.26] Alright, now we’ll talk a little about this movie.
[177.17] What did you see in this movie? 
[180.27] Women were being beaten, and they were running away. 
[183.37] All the women were running in burqas. 
[186.00] People were beating women with sticks. 
[189.83] So, tell me, what does this mean?
[197.32] It means that women don’t have the freedom to speak. 
[202.67] Oppressing women, beating them, abusing them,
[207.67]  not listening to what they have to say.
[209.62] Now, tell me, how many of you have experienced such oppression?
[214.20] No, this can’t happen in our village. 
[217.07] We respect women a lot.
[220.00] Okay, then tell me, 
[222.72] how are the women who work in other people’s homes treated?
[229.20] They do get paid, but are they given respect?
[233.46] That doesn’t happen at all. Even our utensils are kept separate,
[237.13]  even though we’re all Muslims. 
[238.61] then why do they do like this?
[241.64] Ask these women, the maid who works in my house,
[246.00]  I got her educated and now she goes to college 
[249.37] and is just like a member of our family
[252.20] Clap! [Applause]
[259.44] You know, I always used to wonder 
[262.10] what the word 'honeymoon' actually means.
[265.73] And I always thought that going to the moon
[268.56]  is called a honeymoon.
[271.70] You were so cute! I was only five years old. 
[276.68] I also know that the word 'honeymoon' was first used where?
[281.49]  Do you know when? In Northern Europe in 1952, no 1552.
[287.48] Really? I always thought it was a new word 
[290.75] from the 18th or 20th century.
[293.22] And back then, couples in Europe 
[296.94] used to be given honey wine for a year. 
[301.05]  So, where's my honey wine? I, myself!
[306.76] But that's a lot of information about honeymoon.
[310.22] I thought I was going on a honeymoon, 
[312.47] so I should know what it is
[318.94] You know, Abrash, these are the best days of my life.
[325.68] And I want these best days to become 
[329.11] even more beautiful and memorable.
[332.08] How?
[335.26] By not ruining the mood over petty issues 
[338.21] and loving unconditionally all the time
[341.65] You know there is nothing else between lovers.
[345.25] There is only love, I want you to keep on smiling like this.
[351.82] Keep loving me all the time, always.
[361.57] I love you.
[366.16] [Music]
[382.87] Come one! This is the 3rd round, I can't do it anymore
[387.34] It's good, when you'll reach Karachi, you'll be slim. 
[389.51] I don't want to be any slimer than this! You go jogging, I’m going.
[393.16] Where? Home!
[398.66] Come on, let’s run together. Okay, I’ll run with you.
[403.28] I’ll jog, and you’ll drive the car, alright?
[406.02] Actually, I got an idea. I’ll read a poem,
[409.21]  about your beauty, about your hair!
[412.68] Can you recite a poem about my hair? 
[415.06] Yes, yes, come on, let’s try this today.
[417.02] Okay, going alone on a long road feels so blissful. 
[423.88] I'll tell you what 'blissful' means later. 
[426.71] Walking alone on a long road is blissful.
[429.74] Thousands of wishes... 
[432.39] walking alone on a long road feels so blissful.
[435.20] Come on, your jeep is slow, I’m fast, but not that much.
[440.86] Thousands of butterflies fly with us on a long road. 
[444.21] Walking alone on a long road feels so blissful.
[448.21] And your hair is so curly,
[451.73]  I don't even know what poem am I reading!
[454.42] Now you’ve gotten faster, but I’m still running with you. 
[457.89] Go on, run faster. Walking alone on a long road is
[461.64]  so blissful but walking alone on a long road.
[466.44] Oh God! A minibus is coming from the front. 
[469.93] Are you crazy? Ok, walking alone on a long
[473.35]  road is so blissful, thousands of memories
[478.21]  run with us, walk with us.
[481.53] Walking alone on a long road feels so blissful.
[486.60] You go alone; I’m going now.
[489.34] No matter how depressing it is, I’m still enjoying reciting it
[497.68] Hey! I was joking 
[502.07] [Music]
[515.59] Umeeda, I am going to the banglow for the work. 
[518.27] Close the door and take care of the kids.
[545.48] Greetings brother Nazrul! Greetings!
[549.80] Where's aunt Jamila? She left for work 
[552.39] and will go to Shabnum's house from there. Okay.
[557.32] Yes, brother Nazrul is here!
[560.84] What did you do to your head? 
[562.99] You keep doing whatever's in your heart.
[564.87] Go bring me a glass of cold drink. Juice is finished, 
[567.93] but I can get you cold water, I just bought ice.
[571.44] No, I won’t drink water, but you guys do one thing; catch this! 
[576.65] Well done! Now you catch it too! What did you bring? 
[579.49] What are you giving?
[581.06]  Oh, I brought a toffee, you’re going to eat it too, now catch it!
[583.35] Oh, you didn’t catch it, that’s why you can’t become a cricketer.
[587.27] Okay, come here, catch this. Go, give it to your friends too.
[591.77] Umeeda, sit here near brother, here, I brought this for you.
[598.80] Now just tell me, when will Aashti come?
[603.40] Sister Aashti will come after 10 days. 
[605.84] It’s been so many days since she left
[608.92] but still, she’ll come after 10 days.
[611.53]  I don’t know. Boss will give sister Aashti Rs. 3000 
[614.39] that’s why mom sent her to Murree.
[617.45] I had a suspicion from the beginning 
[619.57] that Aunt Jamila did all this out of
[620.94] greed for money. I told Aunt Jamila; 
[624.00] you didn’t do the right thing to me.
[625.74] I know, mother complained to father about you, 
[628.97] she said, Nazrul Islam is not a good boy, 
[630.97] he’s a loafer, a complete loafer, and I won’t marry Aashti to him!
[636.74] Did she say that? Yes. And what else did she say?
[641.06] She said that your mother has ruined your father’s mind.
[646.15] A good woman would never spoil her children like that.
[650.05] What! did she say that about my mother?
[652.70] Now I’ll tell you whose woman is good and whose isn’t! 
[655.98] Give this back to me!
[657.77] Where are the kids!
[660.99] [Singing song]
[674.95] [Singing song]
[689.06] [Singing song]
[697.86] Drive slowly! Are you feeling scared? 
[701.12] Yes, because you're driving!
[704.48] With love, slowly and gently. 
[707.81] You are driving a jeep better than me! 
[709.63] I know right, should I drive faster? No, that's it.
[712.41] Should I driver faster? No!
[715.60] First say you love me, I love you. Louder ... I love you!
[721.20] Louder, I love You
[728.08] [Singing Song]
[733.98] You have no idea; how beautiful you are looking!
[736.98] Let me apply this. Now Farooq will see you,
[743.88] he will fall in love and will say I want to marry this girl only.
[750.60] I have done all the work, I have prepared the juice, 
[755.47] When is your son-in-law coming? 
[758.60] Farooq said he will come till 4.
[761.44] He will come with his friend and brother-in-law. 
[763.50] Mother I am feeling nervous
[765.52] Don't know what Farooq will ask? 
[768.53] Don't know what he will say and do? 
[771.06] Not much, you know what people do 
[774.89] when they go to buy a sacrificial goat?
[778.08] They open the goat's mouth and count 
[782.43] its teeth then make it walk, that's it!
[785.68] He will also open your mouth and counts your teeth,
[789.89]  then he will check your walk.
[792.92] No mother, I won't open mouth, why will he check teeth? 
[796.40] Why are you scaring her Jamila?
[798.36] She is joking, he will ask you questions just answer him.
[804.94] He will ask you simple questions,
[806.96] he will ask what do you like and what you don't like?
[810.81]  Which song do you like?
[813.84] Who is your favorite hero, that's it! 
[817.14] Shall I tell you an interesting thing.
[820.28] When I was getting married, 
[823.01] Nurul Amin came to see me and asked me to dance,
[826.96] I said no, I will not dance, 
[829.95] Nurul Amin went out of the room and
[833.20] said to my mother that your daughter has very bad manners. 
[836.43] I said, I have bad manners? 
[838.52] Fine, go ahead. I won’t marry you
[841.44] Jamila Aunty, shall I also say like this? 
[845.22] Hey, she is joking. Hey Jamila, 
[848.57] why are you messing with her mind? You will answer correctly.
[854.28] When marriage happens, the boy sees 
[856.76] how the girl speaks, how she walks, how she talks,
[860.12] you just answer correctly and whatever he says, just obey him
[867.20] [Music]
[892.30] [Music]
[911.52] You are carrying the luggage? 
[913.80] Why have you brought her with you?
[916.04] How will she carry so much luggage alone?
[920.36] Abrash, it's her job.
[924.32] Abrash ... Okay, I am giving her. Come down.
[960.32] Is it hurting? I should take you to the doctor.
[965.76] Come on, try to get up. It's hurting.
