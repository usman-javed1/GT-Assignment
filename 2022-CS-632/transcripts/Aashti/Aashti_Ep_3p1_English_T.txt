[58.92] Saeed, this isn't fair. Everyone is talking about how you kicked out your wife
[64.64] I am feeling very humiliated
[69.88] Our reputation has been tarnished. Who said this, tell me.
[74.32] Aqeela's condition is getting worse from crying. You are being very unfair to her

[141.00] Why did you bring her back? Why did you bring my wife along?
[147.65]  Take her back. Hey Saeed, you are Crazy. What do you mean?
[155.16] You had to bring her home, didn't you? I was supposed to bring her back, why did you bring my wife?
[160.52] I will go myself and bring her. Zamani Maa, please explain him, otherwise I
[167.88] will break his face, I will hit him. You two have driven me crazy
[173.20] Saeed, go inside. How he will break my teeth, I will tell you, he
[180.76] says that my wife is very beautiful, just like fairy. Am I crazy?

[191.96] will break your legs, Aqeela. I will not spare this pig, he is always talking nonsense.
[199.64] You both fight like crazy dogs
[205.92] I will take her back and you stop talking nonsense and go inside your room.
[211.60] Don't fight now. Your father will come and kick you out.
[217.44] Go inside.

[257.44] Jamila, I've already had a conversation with Masood brother. Now, don’t argue
[266.60] Aashti has completed her studies. Now I will marry her. The load on my shoulders will be lighter.
[271.60] You are not spending on her education.  My boss covers the costs. It's her passion
[278.40] Eight months are left in her exams, wait till then. Aashti is not running away neither Nazrul Islam.

[347.64] otherwise, I will get into trouble.

[375.76] Actually, I need to talk to both of you about something very important
[382.17] Yes, sir, please have a seat. What can we do for you?
[388.98] Noor ul Amin, I have come to ask for Aashti's proposal. What are you saying?
[396.31] Have you gone mad? Are you drunk? Don't you feel shame? She is engaged. She is Narul Islam's wife.
[405.84] Noorl ul Amin, talk calmly. Why are you fighting? Talk to him calmly, he
[412.04] is insulting us, get out of my house. Abba, what are you doing? You go inside and if you step out of the house,
[420.68] I will break your both legs. Noor ul Amin, I have not come to insult you.

[454.00] Salam Zamani Maa. Walikum salam. Come inside.
[458.84] Why are you crying? Be quiet. 
[469.92] What happened? You brought Aqeela again? What can I do, Jamila. My fate is cursed
[476.64] I don't know what kind of boy did Allah give me, he fights with Nazrul that why you bought Aqeela back?
[483.36] Take her back, I
[486.48] will bring her. You are right, he is mad, now you stop crying, all men are like this,
[494.28] with a twisted mind. It's the bad luck of a women.
[498.44] Aqeela ...
[501.54] [Laughter]
[505.94] Why are you laughing?
[507.94] You have come to take your wife, take her. Aqeela let's go home. If you ever came again with someone else, I will
[516.44] break your leg. Cover your face. Why are you laughing? Shall I cry? Go!
[527.60] I am going. Nazrul is at home. He will fight with him
[542.03] This shameless person is standing here.
[544.90] [Song]
[548.90] Don't come in front of me.
[553.92] [Song]
[558.01] Never, ever come in front of him.
[562.01] He is talking about my bride.
[566.02] He is calling her beautiful.
[567.28] I’m warning you, never come in front of him. Always keep your face in veil. Cover your face
[572.42] He is shameless. Aqeela, let's go inside.
[578.16] [Song]
[585.30] What are you doing? Why are you teasing Saeed? What I wanted has happened, so there's nothing to worry about
[595.00] [Song]
[601.48] He is calling my wife beautiful, like a fairy. Nazrul is not a nice man, you will not go in front of him, Aqeela. If you
[610.80] talk to Nazrul, Aqeela, I am telling you that I will throw you out of the house. 
[616.76] I will not talk to him. I will not talk even a little. If you talk even a little
[622.28] I will send you back home ... Bangladesh. Nazrul ... I will not spare Nazrul
[632.67] [Music]
[644.88] Alif, Bay, Pe, Te, Se, Pe, Jeem, Cheem Sheen ... Oh God!
[656.96] Laam, Meem, Noon Yeh, Hai, Ke, Kaaf, Bari Yeh, Choti yeh. Which Urdu you are speaking?
[666.68] The small one comes then the big one, I will give you three out of ten. That's not fair, I
[671.20] deserve some concession. But why? Since 10 years I am not even speaking Urdu
[676.08] So, give me some discount. I think Zarnish is right Abrash. She deserves more marks than this.
[683.08] Okay, here's your one more vote Aunty what do you say? I am
[688.32] with my daughter. I get the majority of votes.
[692.00] Okay!
[695.78] You leave; I can hold. I will hold; I am very happy today. It looks odd, people are watching. You know, I
[702.80] can't believe that you called me early in the morning. At first, I thought I am dreaming.
[707.84] Why, can't I call you? Hey, only you
[712.76] can call me. But I can't believe it. 
[717.84] How Aashti can call me, I was thinking like this. I left for college in the morning, I
[722.88] called from there, it's PCO, I called from there. I swear, I still don't believe it.
[728.52] Pinch me. Oh, come on. You will eat something? I didn't had breakfast in excitement. 
[734.12] Jamila ... Jamila ...
[739.12] Jamila, work quickly, I told you to come early today, brother and sister-in-law
[744.72] are coming and why don't you bring Aashti? Madam,
[749.68] her exam is going to happen, what do they say, she takes extra classes, she returns
[755.16] in evening. Jamila, what's the point of teaching her so much? Have you gone crazy? 
[761.24] I can pay her four to five thousand, why do you waste money and she will not
[766.28] become an officer after studying, Bengalis do not get any office job here, you understand,
[770.56] remove this thing from your mind and tell Aashti that it is day and night work, I will give her Rs.5000.
[776.04] Madam, what should I say, she is fond of studying.
[781.60] You have lost your mind. I think, they have arrived.
[788.60] You have cleaned Zarnish's room? It's clean, I brightened her room.
[793.84] I know, how you cleaned her room. 
[798.36] Asalam alikum
[802.36] How are you, Zarnish? Looking very smart ... Asalam alikum, bhabi
[808.80] How are you? I am fine, thank you. Walikum asalam, how are you?
[813.60] You have become smarter than before. Thank you for the compliment. Sherry, how are you? All right brother, how are you?
[819.76] Ali Alam is not here? Ali is just on the way, he is going to reach any time.
[825.40]  Abrash, show Zarnish her room, please. Go and get luggage from car Jamila.
[834.56] Pakistan has changed a lot.
[835.80] Yes, Bhabhi, even if you come, after 10 years. It's good to be here. I know, I know, come sit
[841.60]  
[845.12] This is your bedroom, the door in front is
[849.72] of my bedroom. I am just telling you. Let me show you one thing. Come here.
[860.20] Remember this? 
[865.60] I don't remember this.
[870.12] You do not remember anything? I should get angry on this thing. Why did I say?
[875.79] This is the painting which I don't know for how many years I have saved.
[879.64] You and I had a fight because of this painting.
[884.36] You did not talk to me for a month and you know that your daddy had made us
[888.52] friends, you don't remember anything? How can I forget. You used to pull my hair, you
[893.88] used to beat me so much and then you used to try to convince me by giving me an ice cream,
[898.28] you used to eat it yourself. Oh, thank God you remember, I used to think that maybe
[904.36] you don't remember anything, you have forgotten everything when I also talk to you on the phone I used to feel that
[908.64] I don't know why I felt that there was no closeness between us, especially
[913.64] from your side, I used to get this feeling. I don't know why you felt like that, I never
[918.20] felt that we were far away. If it weren't for my studies and the issue with college
[922.48] don't know how many trips I would have taken to Karachi. Thank God, the time and distance have reduced,
[929.20] now it will reduce even more. What?  Distance. What distance? Not again.
[937.12] Do you remember? Do you remember how I used to pull? You have not changed. I can never be.
[945.68] You want to eat something? Off course! ... Let's go!
[950.72] [Song]
[965.93] You look beautiful when you laugh.
[967.36] I used to think your mode is always off, maybe you don't want to marry me, that's why.
[973.04] Hey. why I don't want to meet you?
[977.64] Nazrul, don't rush to get married
