That's not fair, I deserve some concession. But why? Since 10 years I am not even speaking Urdu So, give me some discount. I think Zarnish is right Abrash. She deserves more marks than this. Okay, here's your one more vote Aunty what do you say? I am with my daughter. I get the majority of votes. Okay! You leave; I can hold. I will hold; I am very happy today. It looks odd, people are watching. You know, I can't believe that you called me early in the morning. At first, I thought I am dreaming. Why, can't I call you? Hey, only you can call me. But I can't believe it.  How Aashti can call me, I was thinking like this. I left for college in the morning, I called from there, it's PCO, I called from there. I swear, I still don't believe it. Pinch me. Oh, come on. You will eat something? I didn't had breakfast in excitement.  Jamila ... Jamila ... Jamila, work quickly, I told you to come early today, brother and sister-in-law are coming and why don't you bring Aashti? Madam, her exam is going to happen, what do they say, she takes extra classes, she returns in evening. Jamila, what's the point of teaching her so much? Have you gone crazy?  I can pay her four to five thousand, why do you waste money and she will not become an officer after studying, Bengalis do not get any office job here, you understand, remove this thing from your mind and tell Aashti that it is day and night work, I will give her Rs.5000. Madam, what should I say, she is fond of studying. You have lost your mind. I think, they have arrived. You have cleaned Zarnish's room? It's clean, I brightened her room. I know, how you cleaned her room.  Asalam alikum How are you, Zarnish? Looking very smart ... Asalam alikum, bhabi How are you? I am fine, thank you. Walikum asalam, how are you? You have become smarter than before. Thank you for the compliment. Sherry, how are you? All right brother, how are you? Ali Alam is not here? Ali is just on the way, he is going to reach any time.  Abrash, show Zarnish her room, please. Go and get luggage from car Jamila. Pakistan has changed a lot. Yes, Bhabhi, even if you come, after 10 years. It's good to be here. I know, I know, come sit   This is your bedroom, the door in front is of my bedroom. I am just telling you. Let me show you one thing. Come here. Remember this?  I don't remember this. You do not remember anything? I should get angry on this thing. Why did I say? This is the painting which I don't know for how many years I have saved. You and I had a fight because of this painting. You did not talk to me for a month and you know that your daddy had made us friends, you don't remember anything? How can I forget. You used to pull my hair, you used to beat me so much and then you used to try to convince me by giving me an ice cream, you used to eat it yourself. Oh, thank God you remember, I used to think that maybe you don't remember anything, you have forgotten everything when I also talk to you on the phone I used to feel that I don't know why I felt that there was no closeness between us, especially from your side, I used to get this feeling. I don't know why you felt like that, I never felt that we were far away. If it weren't for my studies and the issue with college don't know how many trips I would have taken to Karachi. Thank God, the time and distance have reduced, now it will reduce even more. What?  Distance. What distance? Not again. Do you remember? Do you remember how I used to pull? You have not changed. I can never be. You want to eat something? Off course! ... Let's go! [Song] You look beautiful when you laugh. I used to think your mode is always off, maybe you don't want to marry me, that's why. Hey. why I don't want to meet you? Nazrul, don't rush to get married [Music] [Music]
