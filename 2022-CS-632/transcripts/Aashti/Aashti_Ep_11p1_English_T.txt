[7.08] I don't understand which way the situation will turn, son.
[11.62] If Sherry had arranged this marriage, then I would've blamed her.
[15.52] but it was your choice son.
[19.07] I don't understand, didn't you know about her nature?
[23.20] You've been to London several times, you've met her
[25.34] Didn't you know about her?
[27.72] Dad, I never noticed this in her before; I'm seeing it now.
[32.94] I''ll talk to uncle. No, theres no need to talk to uncle.
[38.03] Sherry should talk.
[42.94] [Music]
[76.14] Aqeela, listen to me.
[79.30] Right now, you have to do one work for me.
[84.00] Somehow, make Aashti drink this bottle of water.
[90.52] How can I make her drink?
[92.47] Just make her drink it somehow, no matter what.
[95.40] How can I make her drink?
[97.13] Hey, do it for your brother's sake, its only a small work.
[101.11] What is happening?
[103.10] What are you saying to her?
[105.20] You've been forbidden talking to Aqeela, right?
[108.32] No, nothing, I was just asking about her health. 
[112.06] Whats happening here?
[114.00] What were you talking to Aqeela about?
[116.25] No, nothing, I just gave her a water bottle.
[121.88] Water! Why did you give her water?
[124.69] I've forbidden you, but still you talk to Aqeela!
[127.73] And you! I've told you not to talk to Nazrul.
[131.87] You'll drink the water!
[136.33] I will kill you!
[142.98] You'll kill him? Have you gone mad!
[145.63] Why did he give Aqeela water!
[147.83] It wasn't for Aqeela, it was for Aashti to drink it.
[151.88] He's a very spiritual elder; it was water blessed by him.
[155.69] Oh, I see! Youâ€™re trying to do magic on my wife?
[159.91] What do you say! Shut up!
[162.00] Take your wife and go inside.
[164.01] And you! Get out of my house!
[166.45] Both fight like enemies!
[168.36] I am going, I'll take my wife too and go!
[171.76] Lets go inside Aqeela. I won't leave you!
[176.13] You've made my life hell.
[178.66] Now your father has given his word over there.
[181.61] He's marrying Nazrul with Umeeda.
[184.02] Dad has lost his mind!
[185.75] Tell him to kill me, to strangle me and finish me!
[192.95] Mom, I'll marry Nazrul brother, you don't cry like this.
[197.04] Shut up! Shameless! Marry him, huh!
[201.23] If you talk like this again, I'll cut off your tounge.
[204.49] You're encouraging your father, go, get lost!
[210.32] [Music]

[303.48] Sir, I couldn't make her drink the water.
[306.97] The water fell.
[310.26] But the slip you gave me, I brought all the items.
[314.60] Why didn't you make her drink the water!
[317.68] The bottle fell and broke.
[321.32] Broke the bottle!
[324.38] Forgive me!
[327.31] Now I'll give you the water again.
[329.74] This time you won't even make a slight mistake!
[340.69] Listen to me, making her drink the water is very hard.
[346.68] Do something else, whatever you say I'll do it!
[350.97] Do something else.
[355.08] Ok.
[357.77] I'll do something else.
[361.28] But it will cost Rs.7000.
[370.67] I accept it.
[373.10] You said, thursday is the last day,
[375.62] so do everything according to it.
[378.85] I said I'll do it so I'll do it! You sit peacefully. 
[406.22] Burn this amulet under the open sky at midnight.
[410.73] Then go to the girl in the morning and ask her to come with me.
[414.53] then see how she'll walk with you, step to step.
[422.68] Sir, are you speaking the truth? Will she actually walk with me?
[427.33] 100% guarantee, she'll definitely come!

[678.00] What kind of drama is this?
[679.83] Why are you so rude to Jimmy?
[682.51] He's just a friend. I'm not doing any drama!
[687.15] You are the one making a spectacle of our relationship.
[696.55] Look Zarnish,
[706.59] Look Zarnish, I love you.
[716.43] I married you.
[720.48] I don't want to lose you under any circumstances.
[722.73] So this was your important talk?
[725.72] You want to prove that by loving me and marrying me, 
[729.73] you've done me a huge favor? 
[733.08] Is this your love? That you can't even tolerate my friend for two days?
[738.89] Do you have any idea how much your attitude
[740.80] embarrassed me in front of Jimmy!
[743.42] I have no problem with Jimmy.
[746.40] I'm not so narrow minded
[748.34] that I have a problem with your friendship with him.
[753.32] I just don't like his informality with you.
[756.21] The way he behaves with you, I just don't like it.
[759.75] Oh I get it, you're just jealous.
[763.73] You're jealous of mine and Jimmy's friendship.
[766.09] You're doubting me?
[768.00] If there was something between me and Jimmy
[770.10] so I would not have come so far to marry you!
[773.05] I'm not jealous of him!
[775.51] I don't even consider him worthy of being jealous.
[783.16] I love you.
[786.35] I love you, why don't you understand?
[791.11] I love you Zarnish.
[794.44] I don't like you ignoring me like this.
