[Music] Do you like jewelry?  Well, every girl loves it anyway. I'll get it for you from here;  be thankful that Zarnish didn't see you. If she had seen, she would have made a big fuss.  She's feeling cold; will you give this jacket? Listen, you're looking good. Listen, you're looking good. [Music] Hey Aqeela, look at this monkey! What is it doing?  Its hands are so small! Absolutely small! I'm going to feed it now, just watch. You know, in my childhood, my mom used to tell me,  there's blessing in movement. I didn’t know even monkeys understood this! Saeed, what kind of move is it doing?  Oh, just look at what it's doing! What are you doing right now, Aqeela?  Cover your face! Cover it!  Who’s going to look at me now besides the monkey? Oh Aqeela, you don’t know, this monkey was once a human too.  Now look, put on your veil—don’t trust anyone! Not even the monkey? Not on anyone at all! I said don’t trust anyone, whether it’s a human or an animal! Saeed, in my Bangladesh, there are such big, fat monkeys! The government said not to feed the animals. Oh, Aqeela, they must be saying that because of poverty,  do you understand! Now quickly put on your veil! Saeed, I'm hungry. Oh really? What will you eat, Aqeela? I will eat chickpea chaat. You'll eat chickpea chaat?  Then who will look at the bear?  We'll look at it as well, first, we'll eat chickpea chaat,  then we'll look at the bear, ok? Ok, come on, let me just feed him one last time Come on, come with us. Oh Aqeela, you always argue with me for no reason about the burqa. Even other women here wear burqas too! Saeed, they can still see with their eyes,  but my eyes are completely covered! Now let's not fight Aqeela. Aqeela, now look, we've seen the peacock,  we've seen the monkey,  now we'll see the bear, but first, you'll eat chaat,  and then we'll go to see the bear! Saaed, this place is so dirty! There are a lot of shameless people here,  the government spends so much money, They have placed 100 men but still no one does any work.  Then they don't give us jobs,  they say you're Bengali and you don't have an ID card. Right now, you stay here,  I'll go get some chickpea chaat and come back. Till then, you eat this ok?  And don't remove your veil, Aqeela! I am going. Ok [Music] Hello Aqeela, I brought the chaat, now you can eat it.  Now how can I eat in the veil Saeed?  Will I hold it or eat it?  I'll hold it.  How will you hold it? Will you make a scene?  You hold it, and I'll eat. Won't it make a scene?  I am not eating, that's it. Aqeela, don't argue right now.  Do one thing, turn your face towards the tree. Turn there, come on, turn! Now, eat it. Saeed, now can I remove the veil? Ok, now take it off! Now happy? yes.  Is it good? It's very good. We're getting late, we've been sitting here for so long,  there are so many tasks at home.  Will this madam even show up or not? She will come, she will definitely come,  I've already spoken to her on the phone. She's about to reach. Now, whoever wants to stay here can,  and whoever wants to leave can go,  I think for your well-being. If I wanted, I could have brought women from outside  or even from other villages. Madam, you will give Rs. 500 for sitting in this program,  and you will also get food.  In addition, tea and cake are separate And if you want, you can also take the dinner home.  I think madam has arrived.  You all shouldn't make noise and should sit quietly, Ok? I'll bring her right now.  Sit quietly and don't make any noise.  Has the press arrived?  Yes, this time I've also invited the channel people Good! very good,  has the arrangement for food and drink been made? I've arranged for sweets and biryani in large pots,  and also had goats slaughtered madam. Good. I have ordered TFC for you and the press. Really, is TFC available here? I didn't know.  It's not here, but if the order is large, they deliver it here as well Madam, the press people are also waiting.  Greetings! Madam is here, stand up! The arrangements seem fine to me, greetings! I apologize; I'm a bit late. Everyone sit down, please. Do you know that  when the sun sets behind these mountains,  its orange rays spread  over the roofs of these houses in the valley it looks so beautiful that you can't even imagine.  And when fireflies shine on these mountains at night,  it feels like stars have descended  from the sky and landed on the earth. The silence here speaks.  Have you ever heard the sound of the silence here? What happened? I can't believe that you have done MBA. From your words, it seems like you are no less than a poet.  As if you've have done master's in Urdu literature,  Well, I don't understand what you say but I like listening to it. Because I don't talk to you, I talk to your heart. The heart, may not understand the sound of words,  but it can certainly understand their essence. Here we go again. Look over there, doesn't it look so beautiful?  And look,  have you seen that house? Isn't it beautiful?  Lovely! Shall we go? Yes, we can go. Last time, we discussed the life of a woman  in terms of her choices. This time too,  we will discuss the same topic, I mean, the same subject. A woman can marry of her own free will. Okay, tell me, how many of you here  have married of your own free will? Okay, tell me, who here cannot marry of their own free will? You are laughing a lot.  It seems that you have married for love.  I don't know, when I got married,  I had no idea what marriage even was What is love,  how would we know? I got engaged while playing  then sat in the house and then got married  and then we had children.  What do we know, we are poor people,  we don't know anything.  Hey, Ramte, why are you speaking?  You were supposed to stay quiet, And what I asked you to remember?  I forgot it. You never forget to take money  but forget your work. Now you have to speak,  and you have to say what I asked you to remember.  Ok? come on, speak fast! Can I tell madam? Yes you tell me.  In our society, a woman can't even breathes as per her wish.  So how can she take the decision of marriage  Even though, our religion and our law allow that, a woman can take decisions as per her own wish,  a woman should have the right to make decisions.  A woman's wish should be followed.  [Praise] Always her phone is off!  I've been trying since morning, but the phone is off Greetings dad! Greetings. Greetings Masood. Greetings Zamani. What happened, do you have a cough? Hey Zamani, this time  I've caught a really big and good fish Oh really? MashAllah, we'll get good money.  After eating food, I'll go to the market. Ok. Hey Zamani, get me a glass of water Aqeela! Hey Aqeela! Get your father some water. Money is needed, right? He also has to get married.  If there's no money, how will the marriage happen? Look at him, he will get married now. Mom! Go give food, heat it up. Whose food are you heating?  How did you come back so quickly from work? When have I come quickly?  He stays at home all day, does nothing,  and no one says anything to him. Why is he at home, understand?  My work is not like yours.  I pull the net once that's it,  unlike you who keeps the machine running all day. understand? You're good for nothing! A hundred strikes of a goldsmith  are equal to one strike of a blacksmith Greetings Aunty ... Mother send Biryani Wow, what an amazing aroma!  Hey, leave it! It's for me, did Aashti make it? No, Aashti didn’t make it. She’s gone to Murree,  in an airplane. She went to Murree? What are you talking about? Give the biryani to your father;  he’ll eat it and then go to the market. What she is saying?  How did Aashti go to Murree like that, without my permission? How would I know if she took your permission or not? Umeeda, you go, he's lost his mind, go, go! But how did she even leave the house? So what, does she need to ask you before going somewhere?  She’s still living at her father’s house,  so obviously, she’ll ask her father for permission.  She’s not your wife yet. Even then, how could she go without my permission? Are you even in your senses right now?   You don’t have any rights over her yet; you’re not married. She’s just your fiancée. She went for some work.  I know why she went. Then why didn’t you tell me? Am I your servant to inform you about everything? Why are you unnecessarily stressing, Nazrul? It’s you who gave Aashti this freedom.  I always said, don’t give too much freedom to women.  And now you’re yelling for no reason. I’ll give you a slap! Don’t say anything else! If you dare raise your hand, I’ll break it.  Animal! Talking nonsense like a dog You are mad! Everyone in this house is mad! What am I saying, and what are you all talking about? Do you like jewelry? Well, every girl loves it anyway I will get it for you from here. Listen, you are looking good [Music] If we race, you’ll definitely lose to me. I won’t even race with you  because I’ve already lost to you in another way.  What’s the point of racing with someone  I’ve already surrendered my heart to! Scared already? I’m not scared; I just know. I want us to live life this way—together,  side by side, step for step.  Neither you ahead of me, nor I ahead of you. But it feels like my horse is running faster than you. Oh, dear horse, my wife doesn’t like that!  Slow down, slow down… good boy! Hey Aashti, take our picture! Look how lovely we are looking. Click, Click! [Music] Where did Umeeda disappear?  She took the biryani and still haven’t come back! Where is Aashti?  How are you even talking? I’ll talk however I want, where is Aashti? She’s gone to Murree. How did she go to Murree without my permission? Your permission? Does she even need your permission? Are you, her husband?  She took permission from her father and went for her duty. Oh really? Since when did her duty involve going to Murree? Tell me, is going to Murree with her sir, is part of her duty?  Is going in an airplane, part of her duty? Don't cheat me. Nazrul, don’t cross your limits. Stop arguing with me!  She’s my daughter, and she went with my permission. When she becomes your wife,  then you can talk all you want. For now, get lost! You can’t do this to me! I’m going to prepare for my wedding  I’ll marry her and take her! Then I'll see how she dares to go anywhere without my permission.
