Abrash, make her wear the ring. Congratulations! [Music] Aashti, don't you have to go to college today? No mother, I will not give the exams. Now I don't want to study more. We can only think about everything; but we can't do everything. Why would you end your life. You are having fever; you want to die? Yes, now I will die, what else will I do? There is nothing here, mother No respect, no love, no happiness, what else will I do, I will die at last. Aashti, you can get everything, in your place, in your community, if you look up, you will fall, you will not get anything, now get up. Come with me to the doctor, I have to go to work too, get up. No mother, I will not go to the doctor I don't want to go to the doctor. Aashti, why are you troubling me? Now Nazrul is a good boy, if you say then I will talk to Zamani aunt. When you will get married to him, then you will forget everything. Come on, get up I will not get married mother. If you people force me, then I will die by drowning in the sea I will not marry. You betrayed me. You are earning your livings with me, still you betrayed me. You told Khalil that I make small net. I don't lie. You even give him the sample. I don't lie, I haven't given anything to anyone, I haven't said anything to someone. You're trying to fool me, aren't you ashamed? You are Burmese, You earn your bread in our country, and still, you betray us. You are lying. I am not lying, I swear. I swear on my parents. You are a liar! Masood brother, forgive him. If he was lying, he wouldn't have sworn.  Just forgive him. If you commit such actions like Hitler again, I won't leave you alive By the way, I know he will do this again.  That's why I won't spare him. Hey, you Burmese's!  Wow beautiful, very beautiful. Look Zarnish, how is it? By the way you intend to weigh Zarnish in gold? Father, who is being weighed in what?  They are weighing Zarnish in gold. Okay, you tell me with what will you weigh her? I will weigh her with flowers, I am not rich like you guys, I am a poor man, a simple man. You are richer than he is, infact your daddy's wealth is yours and mine is also yours It means that you are the richest man in the world. Father, all these are things to say. Sister-in-law, is your shopping over or is there still some left? There are still many clothes left to fit, and Zarnish has to buy more dresses. We should keep Mayoon, Mehndi on same day. Good idea! Mother, I have need to buy glass bangles with these dresses. By the way, when is the Mayoon and Mehndi happening? Let's keep Mayoon and Mehndi on Saturday and wedding on Sunday, because there is very little time.  On Sunday? Oh, there's very little time left, I have to go to the tailor and do many other things, listen, don't you want to do shopping? A lot of shopping! Let's go then. Jamila.... I will try all of these and come back. Yes dear, try all of them. Jamila Yes sir. Give me tea and listen why is Aashti not coming? Father, i have stopped Aashti, actually she has her final year exams so I said that she should prepare well. Why did you refuse? Don't you know how much work is there at home and you have made her focus on giving the exam.  Mother, the work is still going on, what happened. Jamila, go make tea and see where Ahmed is and send him here. Ok madam.  I will also change Sir, I wanted to tell you something. Yes, Jamila, Aashti is not giving her exams. Why won't she give the exam? What happened to her? Aashti says, she won't study further But why? Now what can I say sir, if you explain it to her, then she will understand. Ok, I will talk to her myself, I will come to your house some day. Brother Javed, thank you very much. Mashallah, you have done a lot of work for me. Thank Allah, it is all due to Him, that you work got done. Should I tell you one thing Saeed, all of this is your wife's destiny, my mother says that money comes in the wife's destiny, children are in the husband's destiny. Before the wedding, you made so many attempts, but nothing was working out. After the wedding, you made one attempt, and by the grace of God, it all worked out and that too permanent. Yes, you are right, Javid Bhai, my wife is very lucky, Respect your wife, not everyone gets a lucky wife. It's true. Now I have to go. Come on time tomorrow. Ok. Goodbye. Rashid brother, how much is my bill? [Music] Show me a good saree. Show me that one. How much for the saree? Rs 450. That's too much, reduce the price a bit. Its final, give me Rs 440. I will give you Rs 400 [Music] Sister Aashti, you have to go to the doctor, you have a very high fever. Umeeda, where is mother? Mother's not at home.  Should I make tea for you?  you can eat it with medicine. Yes. Ok [Music] Can't you guys hear? Greetings! sister Shabnam. When did you come back from Bangladesh today? I came today and came to meet you guys first. Sister Aashti would be very happy after seeing you, Sister Aashti! Sister Aashti! Look who's here, sister Shabnam is back from Bangladesh, look! Aashti. How are you? I am fine. So your shopping is all done. Perfect! Are you happy right? Oh alright. I still have a lot of shopping left. Keep on doing. Where are you going? Sir Aashti's not feeling well, I will get her medicine and come back, Madam hasn't returned from the market yet. Ok, wait for a while, I am coming, I too want to go in the same direction. No sir, I will go on the bus, don't trouble yourself. No, I have to go there anyway. I am coming in a while, you sit. Really, Shabnam, I missed you a lot. You said you would come back after two months but you came after whole 4 months. I also missed you a lot, I had many relatives there but you were not there. So, tell me how was your journey to Bangladesh. It was very good. Alright, now you tell me, any news about your sir? Are you still the one running after him, or has he started coming after you too. I thought you must have gotten married. You must have become the lady of the house. Aashti, why are you crying? What happened? Tell me, what's the matter. Shabnam, its Abrash's mehndi tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, he will get married to another girl. All these big people are only big in name; their hearts are very small. They don't love the poor. Stop crying. Stop crying. Aqeela, look I got a saree for you. When you wear this, you will look very beautiful. It's so beautiful. When you wear it, it will look more beautiful I don't doubt you, I love you a lot, but Nazrul teases me, that is why I told you not to go in front of him, his intention is wrong. Saaed, he is my elder brother, if you call him like this then it will be a mistake, brothers shouldn't speak of each other like this.  Then why does he tease me? Now listen, MashAllah, I got a very good job. Really? Yes really, I will get Rs 5000 as salary. Now no more quarrelling and no spoiling the mood.  I will take you for a ride and treat you with ice cream. I will give you swings, and we'll eat chaat, what do you say? Saeed, you said after so many days, I thought, our life has ended. Hey, where has it ended? It has just started! Saeed, now you won't fight with anyone right? Am I mad that I will fight without any reason.  Saaed, you brought saree for me, but not for mother. I will bring it next month for mother. Saeed, this is wrong. Mother will say, my son, my right brought a saree for his wife but nothing for me. She won't say like this, Zamani mother, isn't like this. I will say it, when i will get my salary next month, I will buy her the saree. Ok, now you go and freshen up, I will bring food for you. Really? Yes, really. Sir, you have caused yourself a lot of trouble by coming here. Come, come. Greeting, Abrash sir. Greetings! what am I hearing Aashti, after studying for the whole year, you won't give the exam. Wouldn't all your hard work go to waste? how much loss is this? That's ok, my benefit is nowhere. Madam is correct, what will we maids get after getting educated? Isnâ€™t it just sweeping, mopping, and cooking? What are you talking about? In one day all your views have changed, all your thinking has changed. Life changes in one breath. [Music]
