[Music] Maybe not life with you, but I also get some moments,  but then why does this greed come in my heart, I wish this moment becomes better, if not the century,  then at least it becomes as long as my life [Music] Aashti, today for the first time I felt  how much I love you, my child. Mom, I also went away from home for the first time. Umeda, how are you? I am good? And how are you? I am fine. You? I am fine too. Sister Aashti, can I say something?  You've gotten fairer than before. Really? Am I fair? Umeda is saying the truth; your complexion has gotten better.  Mom, the weather there was very nice, Absolutely cold! Sister Aashti, didn't you feel scared in the airplane?  No Umeda, I didn't feel scared. Because I had tied the seat belt.  Sister Aashti, you didn't bring anything for me. Umeda, I didn't go anywhere alone. If they take me only then I go. I used to work their, they used to roam around. There was only work in my destiny. Mom, I am tired, I'll go and rest. [Music] Aashti, I know everything, how difficult it must have been for you. I know my child. Mom, it was very difficult, very difficult.  Mom, I felt as if there was no heart in my chest; only glass. That used to break everytime. What should I do with my heart, mom? What should I do? I was very scared Aashti, that they don't come to know your feelings. I was very scared, very scared Aashti. [Music] What happened to you Zarnish?  We have spent so many good days over there and you have spoiled our mood here. What has happened to you.  I don't like it, get fine! I didn't like it either, you swear such big oaths of love yet you can't even fulfill one small wish of mine. What did I ask? Just one more week in the mountain, that's it. Look, there was a problem, of my work, my business problem I have set up a new business, if it was the old one  which was already set up, then there would've been  no problem. Today we've come back after so many days but still today I've taken you out so  that our family does not have any misunderstanding about us. So that they don't misunderstand anything. Please, I want you to laugh, talk to me, please don't do this with me. I want you to keep laughing whenever I come into the house. Look at me with a smiley face so that whatever tiredness I have, goes away. Please laugh, get fine please. Forgive me, we'll go again, look how far Murree is, Murree, up north,  we can go anywhere, any time! I know we'll go after 6 months. I know it! No, no very soon,  within a few days my load will be reduced, promise! Trust. we both will go, very soon. Now laugh one time, laugh. Not like this, the other one, more! Let's go somewhere, let's eat something. You want to drink juice, ok come on, let's go. Take out your phone! One second, no rudeness! Come on. Hey, who is it? Who has come? What happened? What have I done? Hey, Nazrul! What happened? What are you doing? What did I do? Why are you fighting at this time? What did I do? Where are you taking him? Hey, listen to me! hey Nazrul! I didn't do anything. Unnecessarily, I was framed; I am innocent.  So the police arrested you for no reason?  How do I know, the police arrests everyone!  Is the police mad? Why didn't they arrest me then? Hey, get lost! What kind of nonsense are you talking,  what will someone say if they hear it? that people of my locality are saying that I've done something,  then they will think that I've done something, you're a weird guy!  Hey, what noise are you making? Sir, I swear on God I have not done anything, why did you lock me.  Yes, you are an angel, we locked you for no reason Don't make much noise, this is a police station, not your aunt's house, understood?  Sir, tell me what has he done? What's your problem? Why are you asking again and again?  Hey, slow down! Malik, come here,
open him, take him to SHO sir. That boy smuggles humans. It is not a minor crime.  Do you know how big is the punishment for human smuggling? Sir, it's a lie, he can't do this,  where would he send, if he would've sent someone then wouldn't he had gone himself? So then am I lying? He doesn't mean that you're lying.  Maybe you have a misunderstanding. We are sitting on this chair. There is no scope for any misunderstanding.  Every work is done with research, otherwise, there would be no chair, no uniform; this is our living. Even then, if you donâ€™t believe me, I can convince you, Saqi. Yes sir? Go and bring two of those people  whom their son was sending to Europe. By the way, what does your son do?  Right now, he does not do any work, sometimes he catches fish with me.  So, what do you give him, I mean how much salary do you pay him? What's the talk about a salary? It's my own business, why would I pay him? We recovered Rs 8000 from him. From where did he get such a huge amount from? Say it! Tell them where the money came from!  Yes, where were you guys going? Sir, we were going to Europe. Who was sending you?  Sir, a man named Anwar-ul-Haq was sending us to Europe. but we gave the money to Nazrul Islam.  How much did you pay him? We gave 1 lakh, person sir. Did you hear it gentlemen? Take them  and take him as well. Come on. Yes, gentlemen what do you say now? I feel like Anwar-ul-Haq was smuggling humans. The boy was only fooled by him.  Sir, the one who knows the ways of earning money like this is not a fool. Tell me, has Anwar-ul-Haq been caught? No, he has run away, we will catch him.  Where will he go? We'll catch him soon. But let me tell you one thing, gentlemen this is not a small matter, we have not filed an FIR till now. Now I fill file the FIR If you haven't filed, the FIR yet then how did you arrest him? Gentlemen, now you don't teach me law what is there in the FIR, it will be filed just now. You all go outisde. Nazrul doesn't do works like this. Anwar-ul-haq trapped him Now God willingly, may Nazrul get released. When he goes home then I'll fix his mind! I will fix his mind, now I don't know whether they will leave him or not.  Masood brother, God willingly he'll get released, don't worry. The sir's a very important person, he has higher connections.  Now if he gets released, I will lock up Nazrul in the house! Not let him go out of the house, thats why I used to say to Nurul Amin If the wedding happens soon, all these troubles will come to an end.  Yes, Masood bhai, as soon as he gets out, start preparations for the wedding.  Look, Masood, Nurul Amin is absolutely right,  take him from here and first of all get him married, he'll live with his wife, everything will be fine Right now, there's no need for him to go out of the house. He'll sit with friends, he will get ruined! Daughter in law will come, everything will be fine.  Understood? Alright? Yes. I can't understand what to do. Zamani, stop crying.  Theres no use of crying now, pray that there's no case on him. Otherwise, it will be difficult for him to be released.  Yes, Zamani mother, aunt is right Don't worry, just pray that Nazrul brother gets released soon. I can't understand, Nazrul hasn't done anything wrong,  now I don't know what has happened to him! He's, my enemy; enemy!  Hey Saeed, Where's Nazrul? It seems difficult for him to be released. What nonsense are you saying! What did my Nazrul did?  He is a broker of sending people, here people can't stay in Pakistan, and he is tricking people into sending them to Europe
