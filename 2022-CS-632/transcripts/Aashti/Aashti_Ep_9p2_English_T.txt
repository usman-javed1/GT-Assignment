[1.13] What do you say!
[6.14] [Music]
[23.35] Don't come back home until I return, shameless!
[26.16] You are so good! what do you say! Hey!
[29.40] [Music]
[31.55] Aqeela! I am going.
[34.20] Remove the veil from your face
[37.24] [Music]
[71.04] [Music]
[146.18] Mr. Mukhtar, this is our new setup.
[149.53] But now we are getting interested in exports as well.
[153.80] Very good Mr. Abrash, I'm very impressed with your work.
[157.52] There's a huge demand for this type of furniture all over the world. 
[162.00] Look, I have a place in Dubai,
[165.03] there are more showrooms there as well.
[168.55] I think if you're interested then you should visit there.
[173.18] And as for the matter of exports in the world, that's exactly what we do!
[177.20] That's why I wanted to work with you Mr. Mukhtar.
[180.59] Actually, no one else can be trusted as much as you!
[183.91] God willingly, have a lot of contacts as well. 
[186.19] Thank you very much for your trust, Mr. Alam.
[190.20] I have a partner, Mr. Bhatti, but I would like my partner in this work
[195.24] to be Arash. Ok, we can talk about partnership later also.
[200.98] Now what you do is, take our catalog
[203.76] and choose the designs you like from it.
[206.84] Let us know, and we will provide you with a presentation accordingly.
[210.28] And as far as the matter of this partnership is concerned,
[212.98]  I am personally against it.
[216.96] In a partnership, a person definitely works for someone else,
[219.59] whereas one’s own work is one’s own,
[221.23] and the profit or loss is also one’s own.
[223.58] However, Mr. Mukhtar because of the
[225.24] longstanding relations with you and your father,
[228.12] and I level of trust I have on you is unparalleled
[232.20] I believe that working with you would be beneficial for us. 
[235.94] so I am not against this partnership. Thank you very much Mr. Alam.
[241.46] You see, money is just a worldly thing; it comes and goes.
[247.65] Mr. Alam, I would like the designs of this furniture
[250.82] to be prepared here. Yes, definitely, 
[253.41] you will get all the designs from here, we will do the designing ourselves.
[257.40] But the best things is that our wood quality is 100% guaranteed,
[263.24] will not get this quality anywhere else.
[265.02] Yes, I'm really excited that you're coming.
[268.72] We all are, yes, yes, I've talked to everyone, we all are. Looking
[272.21] I talked to Nimi, I talked to Shiraz.
[274.12] We all are looking forward to you coming here.
[276.00] We're going to have a party!
[277.35] No, no, you'll love my in-laws, they're so cool, especially and Abrash;
[280.53] he's so chill, why do you worry?
[285.52] Ok.
[289.12] Yes, you'll really like my husband, he's so cool.
[294.33] Jimmy I am married now, ok stop it.
[297.16] Ok, alright, you're better then he is.
[301.08] I love you, ok if it makes you happy then
[304.75] I love you more than I love him, happy? now go, take care, bye!
[309.75] He's mad!
[311.80] Whose phone was it Zarnish?
[314.67] Pippy, it was my friend Jimmy, from London.
[319.44] So such informality with him?
[324.19] Pipy, what happened to you? We are informal,
[327.20]  which is why we speak informally.
[329.13] Come on, Pipy.
[331.07] Anyways, excuse me.
[340.85] Greetings, madam.
[348.64] Greetings madam. Aashti, how are you?
[352.45] I am good, how are you? you, your exams are over, it is over now, there
[355.36] Are your exams over?
[357.11] Right now, the semester has ended.
[360.92] The final exams are after 3 months.
[364.57] What will you do after the exams?
[368.15] I will study more.
[370.39] Really? Jamila was saying she'll get you married.
[374.23] No, madam, I will not marry right now.
[378.69] Madam, I wanted to talk to you.
[384.18] Yes, go ahead.
[386.48] I will work here only after college.
[392.03] This is a very good thing, so from when will you come to work?
[396.54] From now on, starting today.
[402.06] [Music]
[414.72] Hey, what are you doing?
[417.70] I am working, sir.
[421.17] I can see that as well.
[423.07] Why didn't you go to college?
[424.51] I went to college sir; I came here from college.
[427.46] I will finish my studies and
[430.20] then I will work here only.
[432.82] Ugh, you're still not done with your cleaning?
[434.75] Go and serve the food. But the work? 
[437.38] Didn't you listen? Go!
[442.13] Listen, Nimi has called us for dinner today,
[445.21] so, you have to keep tonight,
[447.19] No, it's not possible, I have a business dinner today,
[450.85] there are some people who've come from Dubai, it will get late.
[452.98] What do you mean?
[454.38] You yourself make your own plans,
[456.55] So, what should I do? Should I ask you before making them?
[459.34] So what should I do? sit at home waiting for you and keep on rotting?
[464.06] Every day, you come up with some plan or the other.
[466.76] Look, this is business, I will have to go.
[469.54] I will have to make plans, I had only a brush
[472.56] I've had enough Abrash!
[494.99] Mom's here, Mom's here! Hey, be quiet, you're going to fall! 
[499.34]  Is your college at night now?
[502.62]  Where were you? You'll ruin my reputation!
[505.70] Ask me where she went.
[507.23] Why would I ask you? She left for college in the morning
[509.72] and came back at night!
[511.15] After college, she went to madam's house to work
[514.91] Madam will now give her Rs.2,500 as salary!
[517.50] You were the one who said she should work,
[519.62] and now that she's working, you're complaining! You go inside!
[529.99] inside, I am tired. Why did he say that he will not give Rs 5000,
[532.79] Why 2500? didn't she say that she would give Rs.5000 as salary?
[538.14] She will give Rs.5000 for the whole day.
[541.26] Now she'll go after college, work at night, 
[544.57] and earn Rs.2,500, for now, that's enough. 
[547.02] Why didn’t she quit college? I’ll make her quit.
[550.80] Yelling like this every day at a young child doesn’t look good.
[556.11] I’ll make her understand, you understand!
[564.77] Alright, ok, I am hungry, give me some rice.
[569.59] I will get it right away.
[576.35] Mom, come here!
[580.14] Listen to me. I am coming, be patient.
[593.22] Sit here mom!
[596.15] Can't you come outside?
[597.20] I can't come, if I said it in front of dad, you'd accuse me of making a scene! 
[601.11] Explain to Nazrul, he came to my college today.
[603.80] If he comes again, I’ll beat him in the middle of the road!
[607.14] Be quiet, your father will hear.
[609.63] Why didn't you tell me on the way? tell me, what did he say? 
[613.08] He asks me how I went to Murree without his permission!
[615.47] Does he think he's, my father? Enough, be quiet, 
[618.68] I've had a lot of fight with Zamani mother too.
[622.17] She even hit Nazrul. That's it, it’s over, let it go!
[626.16] The conversation isn’t finished, I’ve said it!
[629.08] If he comes again, I'll hit him with shoes!
[631.73] Be quiet, I'll give your father food and come back.
[638.48] [Music]
[658.70] Aqeela, go and sit inside, what do you say.
[662.70] Go and sit inside!
[664.62] Hey Saeed, why are you making such a scene?
[669.59] Dad, if Nazrul stays in the house then I will not go out of the house,
[673.86] nor will I bring Aqeela in front of him!
[679.14] Alright.
[686.52] Hey Nazrul, get up!
[689.07] Get ready quickly.
[692.17] You have to go with me to the sea, you'll have to work.
[695.43] I won't let you sit and eat!
[698.38] What do you say now! You have to get ready in 5 minutes!
[703.20] Only in 5 minutes!
[706.63] Come on, get up, shameless!
[709.04] What do you say!
[711.69] Where are you going?
[715.32] Zarnish, I'm sorry.
[717.80] Trust me, if I didn't have to go on the business dinner, then
[721.71] I would've definitely gone with you, seriously.
[725.34] Even if you didn't have to go on business, even then you
[729.25] would have had some plan.
[730.69] I have no plans today.
[733.47] I don't have to go anywhere today.
[736.00] Today, when I'll come back then I'll only go with you
[738.75] You tell me, where do you want to go.
[740.11] Wherever you want to go, we'll go, ok? 
[743.17] Now get fine, hey, what happened, look at me.
[747.76] Why are you angry?
[750.24] I'm getting late for office, ok.
[752.68] Keep your mood fine, when I come ok?
[760.90] [Music]
[819.80] Hey Nazrul, what are you doing with the mobile?
[828.87] Sit here and learn how to sail the boat.
[832.57] What's a boat anyway, I ride a motorcyle!
[837.51] You can't even catch a fish and rides a motorcycle!
[841.92] I don’t catch the fish myself. When I see it struggling, my heart hurts. 
[847.75] he's being clever.
[851.54] You won't feel any pain.
[855.47] Nazrul, if anything goes wrong here,
[861.51] I’ll leave the fish and throw you into this net and toss you into the sea!
[867.21] I won't feel any pain.
[870.60] Understood? Yes, yes, you don't worry, relax.
[876.47] [Music]
[906.17] Now things will be fine. Nazrul will work with Masood,
[909.97] at least he won’t get into any fights!
[913.02] Mom, if you get Nazrul brother married, then
[918.00] all these problems will also end.
[921.89] These two brothers keep fighting all the time.
[924.52] Your husband is completely crazy! 
[927.24] Well, he is, so what can we do?
[931.00] You should talk about the marriage.
[934.70] I’ve been thinking about it since yesterday.
[936.92] Today, when Masood comes home, I’ll take some sweets to Jamila's house.
[940.50] and get a final date fixed today
[944.03] If Aashti sister comes here, then my heart will also be at ease.
[947.67] and then the fights between these 2 brothers will end too.
[951.93] I’ll go; I’ll go today!
[954.36] Nazrul also kept bothering me all night,
[956.73] telling me to arrange his marriage this month.
[960.00] I’ll arrange it and get rid of him!
[963.62] Now you go and put this in water, I'm coming. Ok.
[968.08] [Music]
[983.55] Hello, how are you?
[988.05] What's this? Sari, a gift for you.
[994.18] Sari.
[999.33] What will I do with it? You know I don't wear sari.
[1003.58] I know, but it's my choice. I don't like it.
[1008.75] Wear it for my sake, please?
[1011.74] I won't wear it!
[1013.30] Give it to the one who wears it.
