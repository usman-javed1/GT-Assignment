Hey Saeed, Where's Nazrul? It seems difficult for him to be released. What nonsense are you saying!  What did my Nazrul even do? He is a broker of sending people, here people can't stay in Pakistan, and this scoundrel keeps tricking others into sending them to Europe. You are lying! Why would I lie? Dad will come, ask him. Hey Saeed, aren't you ashamed, talking of your brother like this.  Where did he learn to broker? He knows everything, he knows  how to do all the wrong things, I know Nazrul very well. Why should I feel ashamed, this bastard does something  wrong, humiliates me and I should feel ashamed!,  Now when he'll come home, just gets released once then I'll beat him very hard. Zamani, there's no use of getting angry now,  I'm sure the policemen have made a false case. How can he send someone to Europe! Don't worry, he will come. Mom, aunt Jamila is right, These policemen even put noose around air's neck,  they lock up innocent people. What do you say?  Have you seen air? Huh, puts noose around air's neck! Zamani, now be quiet, pray. My child's gone! Brother Nazrul will come back. Tell me how did you like Murree? you went for the first time right? I've heard Murree is a very beautiful place,  you must've visited the mountains as well. Yes, Shabnam, I used to wish that only me and Abrash went to Murree and no one else. I went because Abrash sir told me to; I didn’t want to see the two of them together. You know, Murree is such a beautiful place, so stunning. Over there, the clouds would come down into my hands,   and I would get drenched! It felt as if I got drenched in rain. It was so cold there, that when I wrapped myself in a blanket, I would fall asleep as if I had never slept before Even in that sleep, I would dream about Abrash sir. When aunt Jamila told me that you went to Murree with those people, my heart started pounding. I thought, how would Aashti survive? Those people would laugh, talk, and be happy; how would Aashti be happy then? Shabnam, you were right; I cried a lot. When those people were happy, it felt like,  it felt like I would die. But Aashti, you told me that Abrash loves you, that he will marry you,  so then why did he choose Zarnish? [Music] How was I supposed to know, Shabnam, that fate would betray me, or maybe I betrayed myself. Abrash sir has told me that I must take the exam You know, don't you, how could I ever refuse something Abrash sir says? Now uncle will get you married to Nazrul. No Shabnam, I will kill myself but won't marry Nazrul! Do you know that he does shady work! Do you know what happened last night? The police arrested Nazrul. Then Abrash sir bailed him out, and I was very humiliated! By the way, Shabnam, I always pray that if I ever get married, I go to Abrash Sir’s house. Hey, listen to me, let me speak! The money belongs to Mujeeb brother, not me. deposited it for the ID card; I didn't steal anything, I didn't rob anyone! He's lying! He was sending people to Europe. Is Europe your father's property, huh? Look, you're both beating me! Listen to me, that money isn't mine, I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth! I didn't do anything, the police are lying, everyone is lying!  They're all jealous of me. Yes, everyone lies, but you're perfect, aren't you? Why don't you say where the money came from?  I'll tell you where the money came from! He says it's Mujeeb brother's money, so where did this money come from? I found it in his shirt! Now say something! What do you say! Oh, so I'm totally telling the truth, huh? You pig!  Now I’ll tell you where the money came from. Wait, I’ll tell you right now! I’ll tell you right now! Shameless! Hey, now you're raising your hand on a young woman!  Can't you see, he threatened me! I won’t spare him alive! Oh, let it go, let it go! You won’t spare him, huh?  You said that after he's gone! Now what will we do with this money? Shut up now, put it inside. I’ll handle it!   And Jamila, listen, just get the marriage done quickly, don’t delay any further! Yes brother, yes, you don't worry at all. i'll tell Abrash to call you himself. Yes, indeed, Bye. I was talking with my brother and sister in law on phone. How are they? They were getting a bit worried. Why were they getting worried? He was actually asking that when will Zarnish and Abrash come to London. They just came back from honeymoon,  you should've told them that they'd visit them after 6-8 months. No, they weren't talking about coming in that way. They were asking when are  Abrash and Zarnish settling in London. What? how can this happen Sherry? He's handling my bussiness. Actually, brother wants that, Abrash handles his bussiness in London What difference does it make whether they want it or not? He's handling my bussiness, tell them. So whats the harm in this Ali? Zarnish is their only daughter. So what? don't they know that girls get married and they have to go and live with their in-laws. Sherry, when do I have 10 kids, I have one child only too! He will take care of my business and I have not wedded my son to your house! neither has your brother brought him! Abrash is happy with me in bussiness It is a different thing that if Abrash is saying that if he wants to go, then I will stop him. Ali Alam, I didn't force Abrash into marriage! It was Abrash's wish. You should've thought about this before marriage! When brother said he wants Abrash to handle his bussiness in London What difference does it make whether your brother likes or not? I do not want to separate my son, tell them! Ali Alam, why are you picking fights? I don't have time right now, I don't want to argue with you. But I've my brother that they're coming to London! What! how can you say this? I told you, we'll talk later! [Music] He is saying wrong things! Where does he get so much money from?  Can you get money without work mom? The money isn't his, it's Mujeeb's money! He saved the money for the identity card. He lies to you. Right now, he cries for money, sometimes to his mom, sometimes to his dad! You’re unnecessarily blaming him! I'm not blaming him, I’ll show you! My mind is going crazy! She’s made me mad, I don’t know what she keeps on saying. This phone isn't Rafia’s, Nazrul gave it to me,   I lied to dad, where did he get it from? Where did he get a phone worth 7-8k from?  You guys are blind, you don’t see anything! Abrash just said someone trapped him, would Abrash lie? Mom, Abrash must have said it like this, I’ll ask him tomorrow.  Why do you say such things? He got released now, end this talk! This talk will not end mom! tomorrow he’ll create a mess again!   No one asks! Where does he get all this stuff from? Neither you ask, nor his dad, nor Zamani mother! Every day, he wears new shirts, where does he get all this from? I’m telling the truth, mom, you want to ruin my life, right? Go ahead! But then don’t cry later! Is there a dog behind you? Come on, listen to me first and come inside! Bastard, every time you show up, you bring some kind of trouble with you. Alright, tell me, whats the matter? Mujeeb brother, my father is going to come to talk to you. What?! Your father is coming here? Why? Is he planning to raid the place? No, no! Everyone outside already knows what happens inside here.  If he wanted to raid the place, he would’ve done it already. That Anwar-ul-Haq, the guy who used to send people to Europe, has been caught. It’s a huge mess. And now you’ve come here! The police is after you, are you trying to get this place raided too? No, listen to me! The police isn't after me! I was arrested, but then I got released. The problem is, my father found the money I had. He asked me where the money came from. I told him I had collected Rs.8,000 for the ID card, and the rest of the money, Mujeeb brother gave me. So, if my father comes here, you just have to tell him that you gave me that money to keep it safe. That’s it! Are you telling the truth? First of all, you have the decide the issues upon which you want to work. Then you'll have to draft the proposal and select the committee members as well. But Sherry how will I do all this? Whats the big deal in this? You have your sister, your sister in law and then theres Mrs. Hamdani too. Just put these 2-3 names in and register yourself as an NGO. Then make a good proposal and send it to different funding agencies, they will fund you. Sherry you know that my sister and sister in law; both are not interested in this. And besides, they won’t do this anyway. Then don't let them do the work; just call them on the day the funding committee members come and have them attend the meeting, that's it. Alright Sherry, tell me how to make the proposal? The easy way is I will give the number of a professional he will take some money and make the proposal for you. The name of the game is money darling, if theres money, you don't have to worry. It was mentioned only because I was talking to my mom. Dad, how could you think that I would leave you? My darling, I was thinking the same that how could you say this. I have only one child,  if you don't take care of my business, then who will? Well, what does Zarnish say? Zarnish didn’t say anything like that about me having to take care of the business. Yes, she definitely said that she wants to go to London. I told her, ok, whenever you want to go, we'll go. I think this is all Mom's fault, Tahir unlce must've said something to mom. What happened? You uncle called, he talked to Sherry. She promised that she will arrange a talk with Abrash. No, no dad I don't want to get in this fight. You talk to mom, she'll talk to uncle. As far as Zarnish is concerned, if Zarnish wants to go to London, I'll take her.  But is she has such an intention, then she should go alone.  I will not even go with her. Really, I thought you'd support your mother. Dad, how did you even think like this. No, sometimes you believe what you hear. Where is your wife? She gone to a friend's place, she should be back soon. By the way, your wife isn't here as well. Son,  my wife and your wife; both are same type of women. [Music] Hey Nazrul! where are you going? You won’t go anywhere, you won’t even step outside the house. Why won’t he go? How can he stay at home? I to go to work, and he’ll just stay at home? It won't work like this, mom! What do you say. You, shut up! Mother, I’ll be right back, I’m just going out for some work. You’re not going for any work, just stay at home! Then I won’t go to work either! Have you gone mad? Yes, I’ve gone mad!  If he stays at home, then I won’t leave the house either!  Aqeela, take your veil and go inside! Mother, I’ll just be back in 5 minutes, don’t worry. Not even for 5 seconds! If you go, I’ll break your leg, understand? I’ll leave all my work and stay home, then you'll drive me crazy! Yeah, I know what work you'll do! Mother, if you do like this then, I’ll take Aqeela and leave the house! Go, go! Do whatever you want. But I won’t let Nazrul leave the house! Come on, go inside! bastard inside! I told you to go inside. Don't you dare! Only for 5 minutes. Don't you dare, I won't let you go! I will break your leg, how will you go! I know all that you do. Hey Aqeela, wash the utensils! Mom! Shut up! Shameless. [Music] [Music] [Music]
