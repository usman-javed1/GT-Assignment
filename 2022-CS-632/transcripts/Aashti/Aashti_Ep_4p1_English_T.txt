[0.20] Do you know why he gave the phone? He says, I will talk to you on the phone all night. He's crazy. 
[5.96] Come on, what is your business? Your work is done. Hey yes, my work is done.
[13.64]  I will call Abrash sir first. Yes, and tell him everything,  
[19.00] Open this, how should I dial? Greetings, who is this? Yes Aashti. This is my phone.
[28.16] I need to talk to you about something very important. Oh well, you yourself bought a cell phone,
[35.52] I thought that when you pass with good numbers, I will give you a cell phone, never mind.
[39.80] Tell me what do you want to talk about, I am in the shopping center. Okay, I will call you later.
[45.52] Okay, you tell me, why are you not coming home these days? 
[51.28] You yourself said Abrash sir, to study hard because exams were coming, that's why I didn't come.
[56.56] Good girl, Aashti you always obey me. Listen, you must come this Sunday
[64.68] I have to give you a wonderful surprise. Goodbye!
[70.96]  
[73.88] It was Aashti, she's a very sweet girl. She is very fond of studying but 
[80.88] her family did not allow her, I requested them, now she
[86.28] got permission to study. I have heard about her, isnt she the same girl
[91.80] with whom your mother is always angry? Mother just says strange things when you will meet her.
[97.92] you'll like her very much. She's very loving and caring girl.
[102.28] You tell me, what are you taking?
[108.44] I am taking this. What's this? Don't you wear this around your neck?
[113.24] You wear this around the neck, show me
[117.12] Come on. Its lovely. You shouldn't take this thing when you don't know anything about it.
[122.96]  You're going to get me a diamond ring. Come on, let's go. 
[130.61] [Coughs]
[148.73] [Coughs]
[166.52] You haven't taken the medicine? I ate two tablets, where I will bring more from.
[176.36] How I will go to the doctor? He asks for Rs 200 as fees
[183.91] From where I will bring the money?
[189.54] Light the lamp
[190.80] Kids are sleeping, they will wake up. Drink this herbal tea. Noor ul Amin, you have a lot of cough right now, you should
[199.28] stop smoking hookah, its harmful for your health.
[204.00] Jamila, be quiet. I am having a headache right now.
[210.44] Tomorrow you will not go to work, otherwise you won't have strength in your body
[215.88] Tomorrow there's a party at Abrash sir's house, he's invited me and Aashti. How will Aashti go?
[224.23] I am not feeling well. Aashti will not go in the morning, I will go alone. Madam said she will send a vehicle in the evening
[232.00] then Aashti will come, if she works there, then we will get 200 to 400 rupees, your medicine will come.
[240.36] Alright Jamila
[243.69] What if you got late? Don't worry, we won't get late.
[252.25] [Sings]
[297.28] Mother, tomorrow i will wear this saree, there's a party at Sir's house, it would look good right?
[305.89] It would look very good. Mother, wake me up early in the morning, I will cook food first,
[310.84] then I will go. What will you do by going early in the morning, your father is ill, who will look after him?
[316.12] I will go early in the morning. Mother Abrash sir told me that you should definetly come
[322.12] So when am I refusing, now you go early in the morning, you know how Madam is, she
[327.76] will put all the work on your shoulders, now I will tell Abrash, he will send a car for you in the evening
[334.14] then you can come. Mother, what kind of party is there is sir's house?
[339.80] Oh, I dont know.
[343.51] Now you go and sleep and let me sleep too
[373.44] Hey, come out. you’re watching, how he's talking to me from outside.
[380.56] Saeed, leave it. How can I leave it just like that? I have got married; I will have a child tomorrow.
[385.72] Do I have any respect or not? He's your elder brother, he's just annoying you. Why is he annoying me
[390.78] Am I a girl walking in the streets that he's troubling me. Now leave him, he annoys you and you get annoyed.
[397.80] I will not leave him. Saeed, you swear on me, you will not go outside, you will say nothing to brother, Nazrul. 
[404.01] If you hadn’t sworn on your head, Aqeela, I would’ve taken off my slipper and hit him on his face. 
[413.01] Hey! You are shameless. Hey new bride.
[437.76] Hey!
[452.56] You know, you must wear saree, why don't you wear saree?
[458.12] You know, I like those Bengali women very much who wear saree
[465.00] Look I don't want to see you crying now, smile, come on, smile quickly.
[475.12]  
[479.80] [Song]
[508.84] [Song]
[513.68] One minute, everyone stop, Abrash is making the bride wear the ring.
[520.69] Abrash, put on the ring. Congratulations!
[531.16] Congratulations!
[535.56] Congratulations to you very much.
[539.64] [Music]
[588.43] [Crying]
[613.60] Aashti, what happened?
[619.62] Why are you crying?
[627.60] Mother, why did Abrash sir get engaged? He was ...
[635.47] Aashti! have you gone mad? You think like this?
[642.84] Why, is it wrong for me to think and how much does he care about me? He wanted to marry me.
[650.01] Have you gone mad? Don't say such a thing! Abrash will marry you?
[661.68] You are a servant, a servant, a maid, we can sweep and mop the floor of that house, but
[673.52] but we can’t walk around acting like the lady of the house. Are you thinking of settling in that bungalow?
[682.84] Aashti, you refused to marry Nazrul because of him?
[690.32] Abrash cares about you, he made you study, not because he wants to marry you.
[697.60] Only because he will earn reward.
[703.98] Aashti, these big people do nothing except for their own benefit. 
[715.08] Mother, Abrash is not like this, he told me that he would give me happiness. He gave you the happiness, right?
[721.92] He can't give you more happiness than this.
[727.44] Aashti
[732.36] Our eyes are small,
[736.72] very small
[740.98] We can't have big dreams.
[746.96] These big people, you know
[752.64] can fill our pockets with money, but not with happiness
[762.68] Do you understand? You will die crying,
[769.40] still, you won't get him
[777.20] You won't get anything.
[795.40] Till now, 15 men have been sent there, they enjoy themselves over there. Will there be any trouble?
[806.24] If the police caught us? The police don't arrest anyone there. The person who leaves from here
[813.52] becomes a refugee. What is a refugee? 
[818.72] I will explain it to you. Whoever goes from here, his passport ID card is fake
[823.76] It can only be used while going from Pakistan to Iran. Then when the time comes to leave Iran
[829.64] he burns the passport and ID card, then Anwar Bhai's agent gives it to the Turkish
[836.12] agent, then the Turkish one gives it to the European agent , then you will have to pay Rs. 3.5 lakh,
[842.84] he will take the money, make your documents and put you on work. No worries, just be energetic
[849.84] Did you understand anything? Now tell you want to go or not? I have to go, for sure.
[857.48] First tell me, how many people have you gathered? Six are confirmed. In a day or two, I think that
[865.32] there will be one or two people. Everyone says that the money is too much. Then leave this.
[872.28] 4 lakhs seem too much, then leave the Europe, die here in Pakistan. Hey Saleemullah, handle him.
[877.52] Please sit, where are you going. You’re having a conversation that’s wasting time
[885.16] I have to send more people, tell me now whether you want to go or not?
[888.74]  I want to go. I have already discussed with them. 
[891.76] They are waiting for me. Nazar said, it will take 50k. 50% off.
[899.48] Okay, you go and bring the money, give it to Nazrul, even fake documents cost money, understand?
[907.08] Go now. Okay, I left in one way and returned in another.
[915.20]  I left in one way and returned in another. He doesn’t have money, but he wants to go to Europe
[952.56] [Laughter]
[970.28] Put the ring on Abrash ... Congratulations!
[987.92]
