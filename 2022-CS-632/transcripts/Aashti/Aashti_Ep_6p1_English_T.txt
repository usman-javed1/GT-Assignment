[0.00] It's about a week to 10 days, 
[2.87] Okay, thank you so much, I will talk to you later then.
[6.88] Thank you, Goodbye! Your work is done.
[12.52] The guest house is arranged. 
[14.01] Thank you mummy. Pipi (Aunty) , I hope it's not too crowded
[18.72] and it should be of a certain standard too.
[20.83] Don't worry, it's a fully furnished guest house.
[24.04] It's also very beautiful, you will not have any problem there.
[27.56] But there might be one problem. 
[30.93] You guys will drink coffee, tea, clothes will have to be ironed.
[34.93] So, you guys would have to do that work yourself. 
[37.03] No aunty, it's our honeymoon, I can't do all this work.
[40.77]  Why don't we stay in a hotel? 
[43.13] No Zarnish, I can't stay in a hotel please.
[46.05] why don't we ask her?
[50.56] Not a bad idea. It's difficult that she will agree.
[56.91] Aunty, we will pay her, why won't she agree? 
[59.32] You guys leave it, I will ask her
[61.28] Aashti, come here.
[67.60] Yes sir. Me and Zarnish are going to Murree,
[72.00]  so you come with us.
[74.48] The weather there is amazing. You will have fun there, 
[77.06] even the clouds come into the room.
[82.65] Father will not allow me. 
[85.51] We will pay you, is 2k or 4k rupees bad?
[88.23] Don't worry about your father, I will say to Jamila, 
[91.93] she will talk to your father.
[93.84] But how will I go? We will go by plane, 
[99.57] Tomorrow's morning flight to Islamabad, 
[101.47] then from there to Murree.
[105.07] [Music]
[129.45] Oh my god, this is so much fun! right Abrash? Yes.
[133.31] I am so glad, we came here.
[135.39]  I have seen Europe, I've seen America.
[137.14]  I've seen Australia, I just had to see
[141.16] Pakistan, and I love it.
[143.48] Your hairs are very nice, you can keep them open.
[145.51] Abrash, you know how my hair are like. 
[147.93] In these mountains, no one will say anything about your hair.
[151.48] No one will see your beautiful hair. 
[154.76] Don't you want me to look beautiful?
[157.54] You are looking good, even right now. 
[159.69] You will look even better if you keep your hair open.
[165.28] Aashti how are you feeling? Are you enjoying or not? 
[168.67] Aashti is happy. 
[170.67] Yes, enjoy, you will not get a chance again
[177.63] [Music]
[249.08] God! How are you feeling? 
[252.38] I had no idea Pakistan would be so beautiful.
[256.48] But the true beauty of this place is that you are with me.
[261.56] We both are together.
[263.70]  I am so glad we live in Pakistan. 
[266.93] If there were two or three more like you here, 
[268.99] how much fun it would be. 
[270.59] You really ruin the whole mood
[273.08] Come on, your mood isn't ruined at all.
[277.41] [Music]
[303.19] Saaed, why are you staring at me like that?
[306.00]  I am feeling shy.
[307.49] Hey, if I don't look, then who will?
[310.78] I never said don't look at me,
[313.05]  but at least say something.
[314.81] Today, I will say nothing. 
[317.76] Today I will only look at you and listen to you.
[320.76] What will I say? 
[325.08] Saeed, why don't you go fishing with father?
[330.16] Nazrul brother also doesn't go either. 
[332.86] Aqeela, I don't like the job of catching fish in the sea.
[336.88] You still go to the factory; you don't like your work?
[342.08] If I tell you the truth, Aqeela, you won't laugh, will you?
[348.54] Why would I laugh? When I was very small,
[351.37] once father took me with him to catch fish in the sea
[356.36] That night there was such a dangerous storm,
[359.95] we managed to escape from there with great difficulty. 
[361.97] After that, I swore that
[363.73]  I would never go to the sea with father again.
[366.00] I feel very scared at night Aqeela. 
[368.00] Saeed, I feel scared too.
[370.13] Do you know, Nazrul, that shameless person,
[374.10] when I was small, 
[375.75] he used to tell me that he's not my elder brother,
[377.80]  he's a ghost. He used to scare me.
[380.80] And you used to get scared? I was a kid,
[384.87] my heart was also small that time
[386.44]  but now I am not scared of him.
[388.88] I have caused great harm to Nazrul after growing up.
[391.44] What harm did you cause to Nazrul, brother?
[394.46] I picked up his 2-4 shirts, 
[397.10] 2-4 shoes, and threw them in the sea and
[400.04] I also sold his 2-4 pigeons!
[402.00]  And Nazrul brother said nothing to you? 
[403.42] He would have said something if he found out.
[406.44] After that, I released a cat in his pigeon cage
[411.29] and by the time he got to know, 
[412.76] 2-4 of the pigeons got eaten by the cat. 
[414.70] Saeed, you didn't do the right thing.
[418.72] Pigeons are innocent bird, and you killed them, 
[423.97] Allah will be angry with you. 
[426.00] Nazrul can do whatever he wants, 
[427.14] and I can't even take revenge. 
[428.21] Look, Aqeela, don't defend Nazrul in front of me, 
[431.80] I don't like it.
[434.22] Now, get up! Let's go home. 
[437.13] Always defending him, now go in front!
[445.04] Who will wear the veil, Aqeela?
[447.62]  There are so many people standing, come on!
[452.60] Look, men are coming from front, 
[454.58] that's why I told you to take the veil.
[484.48] Aashti
[492.32] Yes? What happened, are you okay?
[496.45]  I don't know, what's happening in my ear,
[501.17] I am hearing strange sounds. 
[504.43] I told you if there's any problem, you should tell me.
[507.40]  I was fine after getting off the plane
[511.31] I don't know what happened to me over here.
[514.32] Look, actually we are at a high altitude, 
[516.63] air pressure here is less.
[518.31] That is why you are feeling like this right now, 
[520.86] after some time, you will get used to it.
[522.40] You will be fine, enjoy yourself here! 
[525.28] Look at what an amazing place you've come
[527.30] Who knows if you'll get this opportunity again or not. 
[529.65] I might never have been able to come here in my life.
[532.67] because of you, I got to see such a beautiful scenery. 
[539.68] Alright then, good, you liked it right?
[542.43]  I liked it very much.
[544.67]  Now you have to do one work for me. 
[547.03] What is that? 
[548.97] Bring good grades in exam. Absolutely. Good.
[551.27] Let's go, I am ready.
[559.12] [Music]
[630.80] [Music]
[659.28] Have you gone crazy? 
[661.06] Why did you send Aashti? 
[662.87] Nurul Amin, stop blabbering now.
[665.14] I sent her after asking you 
[666.61] then why are you constantly asking,
[667.90]  why did you send her?
[669.90] Abrash's wife said, she will give Rs 3000 for 10 days, 
[673.93] we still have to repay the loan.
[676.92] You don't care.
[681.16] You always do whatever you want
[683.34] Aashti is my kid too, not just yours. 
[686.12] Greetings aunt Jamila! Greetings! 
[689.18] Uncle how are you? I am good.
[692.10] No, you are not looking fine
[693.31] Jamila, don't you feed your man, 
[696.43] he's gotten so skinny.
[697.75] At this point, he eats my brain as well,
[699.76] how will I make him fat? 
[701.46] Jamila, do you even have a brain in your head? 
[704.91] What will I even eat?
[706.48] Brother Noor. Jamila,
[711.52] I am going to meet Meezan Baba. Okay!
[716.59] Sit
[719.48] How are you, Razia, came after a long time.
[722.34] I came three times, you weren't here, 
[724.34] you go in the morning and come at night, 
[726.64] why do you do so much work?
[728.41]  When do I come back in the night?
[730.53]  I come back in the evening.
[732.27] There was Sir's son's wedding going on  
[734.09] because of which I would get late.
[735.55] Now you tell me, 
[737.21] when are you getting Shabnam married?
[739.15]  Aunt Jamila, it is because of this reason 
[742.62] we came to get Aashti. 
[744.17] Be quiet, Jamila the proposal has been finalized, 
[748.06] but the date has not been set. Now the boy says, 
[751.08] he will see Shabnam. Shabnam is shy 
[754.48] She says that if Aashti will be with her, 
[757.04] then she will go in front of the boy.
[758.88] Aashti is not here, 
[760.59] she has gone to Murree to see the snow. 
[763.00] She went to Murree? Yes! in the plane
[766.04] She was scared and saying that she wouldn't
[768.46]  sit in the plane it would fall.
[770.20] The plane doesn't fall, I have sat in it and seen. 
[775.01] Then, Sir and his family were making fun of her. 
[778.52] They travel by airplane a lot. 
[780.02] Aunt Jamila, if I tell you one thing 
[782.74] about mother you will laugh.
[784.28] When we were going to Bangladesh, 
[787.04] we had to sit in the airplane for the first time.
[789.68] When we were about to board the plane,
[792.00]  the other plane took off, 
[793.32] as soon as mother saw, she ran down the stairs
[794.76]  and said, 'I will not go, 
[798.00] this airplane will fly and then fall down'. Oh Razia!
[801.32] Now how would I know? 
[804.23] I said, it's such a big piece of iron, it will fall. 
[807.20] Now will you drink tea?
[811.06]  Yes, I will drink. Why did Aashti go to Murree? 
[816.17] Abrash sir and his wife took Aashti; 
[818.62] there's a lot of work there.
[820.48]  Jamila, this is very bad,
[822.94]  now her engagement is about to happen
[824.84] when will Aashti be back? 
[826.61] She will come back within 10 days. 
[828.99] She will come back before her engagement. 
[830.99] I will bring the tea.
[833.00] Why are you making fun of me 
[834.80] regarding the plane thing?
