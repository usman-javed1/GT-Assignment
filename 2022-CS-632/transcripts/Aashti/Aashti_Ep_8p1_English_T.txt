[0.20] I am a bad woman, I ruined my children, 
[3.68] my son is a scoundrel; this is what you tell everyone.
[8.60] Umeeda told everything to Nazrul! 
[11.55] He blocked my path, came to my house,
[14.76] stared me in the eye, and questioned me,
[17.78]  how I sent Aashti without his permission.
[20.47] Who is he anyway? He’s not Aashti’s husband, is he? 
[23.08] Now he has humiliated me in the entire neighborhood.
[25.51]  In front of the pan seller, the vendor, the scrap dealer.
[28.55]   he mentioned my daughter's name to everyone.
[31.64] Now, wherever I go, people ask me, "Where is Aashti?" 
[36.00] He insulted me and made a mockery of me.
[38.69] I gave my daughter in marriage, not into slavery. 
[41.66] If Nazrul had spoken this way, you should've told me.
[43.45] I would've broken his leg, but instead, you blame me, 
[47.34] saying that I’m not a good woman
[49.02] and that I spoiled my children. 
[51.06] Yes, you're right, I do speak the truth. You ruined the boy;
[54.13] why didn't you tell him that Aashti is nothing to him yet?
[57.73]  I told him so many times, but he doesn’t understand.
[61.31] He’s crazy! Masood scolded him, he told him 
[64.36] not to speak like that. Ha, Masood scolded him!
[75.73] Now don't worry, I will go talk to him, I’ll break his legs! 
[82.52] Don't get angry like this. How would I not be angry! 
[86.37] He blocks me in the street, and I shouldn't be angry?
[88.94] No, not at all!
[93.00] This talk of breaking the relationship is so wrong.
[99.81] It’s been so many years, and my entire family knows 
[104.01] Aashti is my daughter-in-law, your whole family knows
[108.00] I know, because of it, I will never let anyone disrespect me.
[111.31]  No one will disgrace me. 
[114.19] Now let’s end this conversation, Jamila.
[117.73]  I’ll go, I’ll break his head, I’ll hit him with slippers
[121.92] How dare he stop you on the street and ask about Aashti!
[125.05] Don't worry, it won’t happen again. I’ll go,
[127.16]   and I’ll also talk to Masood, how dare he do like this!
[131.03] Why would he stop you on the street? Why would he ask about Aashti?
[135.92] Umeeda!
[143.16] Yes mom. Come quickly.
[148.79] What did you say to Nazrul? 
[152.96] My talks, our family matter! He asked me mom.
[158.31] He asked me mom, where's Aashti 
[160.32] so what was I supposed to say to him? That's why I told him.
[162.90]  Alright, you went on the road. 
[165.57] Mom, I didn't tell him on the road, he came home
[168.00] and then asked. You should've told him you don't know. 
[172.09] You tell to always speak the truth and not lie.
[174.84] How would I lie? You called him a scoundrel,
[178.47]  I told him. You're going to speak the truth huh!
[181.80] You will insult me!  now if you spoke about our family 
[185.57] matters outside again, I will cut your tongue,
[188.30] break your leg! Do you get it? Now don't talk. 
[192.57] Speak truth but not with such people, say you don't know.
[196.71] Do you get it? Ok, I'm going now!
[204.00] [Music]
[223.67] In love, people behave like children. What love?
[229.39] I don't love you. Alright listen, all lovers have a song.
[234.71] So we should have a song as well. Example? I've selected a song. Which?
[239.15] Now I will sing you our song! You'll sing an english song.
[244.03] [Music] [Laughter]
[250.72] No you can't dance you!
[255.04] [Sings song]
[267.12] I love you, keep on jogging as well. Come on jog! 
[272.64] Have you gone mad? Did we come here to jog?
[276.29]  Did we come to dance on the road? 
[277.92] You have such a beautiful and pretty wife
[280.11] and you're making her thinner I will disappear. Now, don't dissapear.
[292.33] [ Music]
[349.02] Hello, greetings Madam! Greetings,
[354.42]  let me talk to Abrash or Zarnish.
[356.85] Abrash sir and Zarnish madam have gone for jogging, 
[361.16] you can call them on their phone
[364.57] Both of their cell phones are off,
[367.30]  I just wanted to know when are you guys returning.
[370.46] I don't know about it madam, 
[373.07] when Abrash sir will come I'll make you talk with him.
[377.10] Madam, is mom there with you? Could you let me speak with her?
[383.32] I will talk for two minutes. Ok, hold on.
[389.14] Jamila. I'm coming madam!
[397.32] Yes madam? It's Ashti's call, she wants to talk to you. Hello,
[402.64] how are you Aashti? hows my child?
[410.22] You're happy, aren't you?
[413.35] Amma? How can I be happy?
[419.36] I told you, don't send me here. Mom,
[426.90] All day and night, my heart burns.
[436.52] I cry all night.
[444.35] Mom, how can I tell you, seeing Abrash sir with madam
[449.12] seeing them both together
[454.93] I feel very sad, mom
[458.50] I feel a lot of pain, mom
[462.67] My heart burns
[466.17] Aashti, don't cry
[469.25] Don't talk like this
[472.61] Ok now, my child, you’ve reached a new place, you’re sitting in an airplane, 
[477.87] this is a moment of happiness for you, right?
[482.76] Yes, its fine.
[486.58] The kids are fine aswell, they miss you a lot,
[490.10]  your dad was also asking about you.
[493.61] I will say to madam, Aashti, now I'll switch off the phone, goodbye!
[508.93] Thank you madam.
[511.73] Where were you at night!
[514.22]  If you would've come home last night I would've broken your legs!
[519.27] I was so angry, now my anger has subsided. 
[522.00] Hey mom, why didn't you tell me at night?
[524.57]  I would have found him from anywhere.
[527.35]  You stop your nonsense, or I will break your face!
[531.28] How will you break my face? You humiliate me;
[536.25] people say I’m a bad woman and that I ruined my children!   
[540.16] All because of you! Why did you go to Jamila's house? 
[544.61] Tell me, why did you go there? Mom don't hit him.
[548.69]  Oh, you stay quiet! Mom can hit him wherever she wants. 
[552.38] Hit him, Hit him with this knife!  
[554.83] Mom, make him shut up right now, or I will hit him!  
[557.43] You’ll hit me? Who do you think you are? 
[561.06] Jamila aunt, she lies! I didn’t say anything.
[564.27] You stopped Jamila on the road and asked about Ashti, 
[567.92] didn’t you? Who is she to you? Huh? Speak up!
[570.58] If you go to her again, I will break your legs!  
[574.03] Mom, this is the last time I’m saying it: Aashti will come here. 
[577.79] Within a week, my wedding must happen.
[580.40]  If it doesn’t, I’ll kill myself! 
[582.83] That would actually be good if you killed yourself!
[585.20]  I’m already doing your work, you useless person!  
[588.38]  
I won’t die like this. First, I’ll kill you, and then I’ll die.  
[595.25] Are you mad? why you are hitting him? 
[598.10] All the time, it’s constant nagging and yelling! 
[600.27] You filthy pig, I won’t spare you! 
[602.98]  Get lost! 
[604.98] Go to your father! If you don’t, I’ll hit you even more right now! 
[608.94] Fine, I’m leaving. I’m going now! But I’m not going 
[611.88] to spare you either, you pig! Wait, I’ll show you!
[616.10] Shameless!
[621.60] And you dare talk back? Aren’t you ashamed 
[624.24] of talking like this to your elder brother?
[626.24] Mom, what did I do? Shut up! 
[628.22] otherwise I'll break your leg as well! Shameless!
[632.20] Aqeela, take the veil!
[639.53] [Music] 
[645.74] Sing a song! Which one? Anyone.
[649.53] [Sings song]
[662.28] [Sings song] I don't know more, lets sing another another song!
[668.12] [Sings song] Another song!
[673.76] [Sings song]
[683.08] [Sings song]
[689.58] [Music]
[696.93] [Sings song]
[705.22] I just remembered, the girl you were asking about, her name was Monica.
[708.84]  Yeah, kind of a cheap name, just leave it, man. Anyway, the guy’s name was 
[715.92] Jhon. What? Jhon!
[729.86] Do you get it? Come on, go!
[739.92] [Laughter]
[744.64] You won't get dirty, come on, sit down!
[756.12] By the way, Sherry, I must admire your courage for
[759.49] getting along so well with women like Mrs. Kirmani and Mrs. Javed. 
[765.24] It takes effort, my dear, it really does! You see,
[768.64]  they are members of the organizing committee of my NGO.
[772.07] And whenever the funding committee comes over,
[775.03]  I absolutely have to invite them.
[777.17] Because if they say anything against me, consider my funding cut off!
[782.71] By the way, how do you manage all this? Yes, it
[787.84] is not that easy to manage all this,
[790.74]  do workshops, seminars, gather women and then
[795.28] have long discussions in front of those women. What do you think? Do they
[799.76] understand the long speeches 
[802.42] or does it awaken some courage in them that they
[804.55] should make their own destiny? What kind of topics have you started talking about?
[808.72] and tell me what is happening in the world. 
[811.17] Hafeez said to me that like Sherry, you should also 
[814.53] you should also open an NGO and you know Sherry, 
[817.73] I have no knowledge about it.
[819.55] And Hafeez was saying that Sherry is your friend, ask her, that's why
[823.96] I am asking you, so tell me one thing, 
[826.92] does one benefit from it themselves as well or 
[828.92] the money comes and goes, then why should one get this headache? 
[833.54] Shouldn't I start another business!
[835.30] Now, haven't you spoken your heart out? 
[838.23] Your husband is absolutely right that there
[840.72] is money and fame in this. Sherry you just tell me one thing right now, 
[845.30] how do you make money in this?
[848.11] I will tell you, I will tell you everything. First get me some tea! Okay, I'll it for you.
[855.83] Zarnish, you know, all the days I’ve spent here 
[862.71] with you, near you, 
[866.84] I feel like I’ll never be able to forget them for the rest of my life.
[871.88] My heart wishes these days would never end
[875.72] and that we'd always stay here, in this guest house, 
[879.41] amidst these mountains
[883.23]  just you and me, with no one else around.
[886.93]  That you wouldn’t leave, and I wouldn’t leave either.
[891.26] But Zarnish, we can’t spend our whole lives here.
[894.78] You know, dreams are very different from reality. 
[898.51] The dream is that we stay here forever,
[902.77] but the reality is that we’ll have to leave this place behind.
[910.66] Hello?
[913.47] Yes papa, how are you? I am absolutely fine and so is Zarnish.
[924.80] Tell him that I will meet him the day after tomorrow, 
[928.25] yes I will come tomorrow.
[930.53] Send someone to the airport at 6 o'clock,
[933.28]  the flight's at 4 o'clock from here.
[936.00] there is a flight from here at 4:00 o'clock, 
[939.09] okay, yes, I will come, definitely! 
[941.79] Ok, see you tomorrow, bye! 
[944.80] Why didn't you tell me that we're going tomorrow?
[949.98] You knew that we were going to stay here for 10 days.
[953.77] Yes, but you should've asked me before confirming the seat!
[958.03] I will not go now! Ok then don't go, stay here
[964.36] Alone? Not alone, you can keep Aashti with you.
[968.73]  Aashti? that maid!
[970.59] Maybe you have a good understanding with the servants, but I don’t.
[974.80] Tell Papa that we will come next week. 
[977.36] This cannot happen Zarnish, I have started a furniture business,
[980.83] I have to export it and much more work, 
[983.57] Papa cannot handle all this.
[985.56] Then don't handle it, you can handle it next week. 
[988.32] Zarnish we've roamed around a lot!
[991.82] There are thousands of tasks which are pending, 
[994.39] we will come again. It's not about coming again!
[996.83] It is a matter of mood, some other time I can come alone aswell.
[1001.71] I am surprised how big claims you make of your love 
[1005.37] and then can't even agree to a small thing for me!
[1008.38] Love doesn't mean that we should leave the whole world and sit in this wilderness.
[1014.25] Wilderness? a while ago, you found this wilderness 
[1017.94] very beautiful. It's beautiful even now Zarnish.
[1021.40] You just have to understand,
[1024.20]  we will suffer a lot, why don't you understand, we have to go!
[1027.36] Why do I have to understand each time?
