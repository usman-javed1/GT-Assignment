I won't wear it! Give it to the one who wears it. [Music] Aashti, you take this sari.  Take it, it will look very good on you. Anyway you look very good in sari. Take, keep it! Take it, it's a very nice sari, keep it, wear it. [Music] Do you know what? I was just thinking about how quickly we realised how different we are. It's good that we recognised it early. [Music] Look Zamani, I will reach on time, We will finalize the marriage date according to our will But we will take the date as per our wish. Amma, I am ready now, let’s go! Nazrul hasn’t arrived yet are we supposed to go empty-handed now? How can we go empty-handed? You’ll take these sweets with you. I brought rasgullas—Aashti loves them. Amma, don’t take too long a date I have to get married in this month, that's it,  I know exactly what to do But you won’t leave the house  If you leave, you won’t get married.

There’s a salesman there who offered me a salary of 4,000 rupees. I’ll work there and live peacefully, that’s it We’ll see how peacefully you live Hurry up now, we’re getting late! Remember mother, this month
  Don't delay. Go fast.  [Bangla Song] Aqeela ... Aqeela ... Mom ... Aqeela ... Where is Aqeela? Where is Mom? Why are you singing? My choice—whether I sing or dance, Stop singing! This is a very valuable and expensive saree with beautiful color.  Do you know, Shabnum, Abrash Sir is not happy with Zarnish. I find my judgment to be accurate Zarnish's mother forced her into marriage This saree is so beautiful and valuable Abrash Sir brought for Zarnish and Zarnish refused.  And then he gave you? Such precious sari?  Aashti, it looks like you're making a place for yourself By the Shabnum, I too feel like this.  It seems that my trust which was broken is being rebuilt. To me, that house feels like my home, my real one. May Allah make it happen May it be like this, I always pray this, Aashti sister, Amma is calling you. Why? Masood uncle and Zamani maa are here to fix your wedding date. Come Quick! 18th of the month is, okay? Masood, Jamila is saying for the 18th? Yes, 18th is fine. Zamani, we want to get them married soon.  I say the same, do it quickly. It will lighten the burden on my head Congratulations, 18th is the final wedding date. Hey Zamani, which sweet will you eat? I will have Gulab Jamun. I don't want to marry a loafer like Nazrul. All of you listen, I will not marry under any circumstances, even if you kill me How can she refuse to marry? I will marry her at any cost. Narul Amin is right, Jamila, have spoiled the girl. He had said not to educate the girl too much  otherwise, she gets influenced by the ways of the world. See how fearless she is, she stood in front of everyone She knocked the sweet out of my hand. This is not game. I’ll talk myself. Hey Nazrul, you will not go there. We are not so desperate that we would go and beg for marriage The disrespect won’t be ours; it will be on the girl’s side Tell Mijan Baba, he has given us his words.  How Noor uncle can refuse him? It’s not Noor ul Amin who refused, it’s Aashti who refused That girl has gone mad. She says, 'I’ll give up my life but won’t marry Why does he take out Aashti's anger on us? Kill me, but I still won’t marry Nazrul. I will die but never marry Nazrul. Leave her. I won't leave her. I will kill her. So many years have passed, and by saying no she made us feel humiliated, I warned you again and again  not to send her out, but you didn’t pay attention. I won't spare her! She has gone crazy. Why are you standing here? Go inside. This girl has gone crazy, and she has made me crazy too forgive me, forgive her, she has gone mad. If she has gone crazy, send her to the asylum but will kill her. If you kill her, you too will definitely go to jail.  I will go, I will definitely go to jail If the need arises, I will even hang myself. But I will not leave her. Forgive me and her too. I will talk to her Nooral Amin. I will Jamila, I will not step into this house until she agrees to marry, I will not come back I am leaving now! Nurul Amin! I won't come back home now! I've gone mad! You've already made me crazy, humiliated me, and caused my disgrace and caused my disgrace. What did you do like this? Tell me! Hey Umeeda, you go outside, go! Aashti, why are you doing like this? Now even Abrash is married. Now, whose love are you going crazy for? Why have you become an enemy of your life, Aashti? You've made your father gone mad as well. Mom, I won't marry. I won't get married with anyone. Yes, you'll spend your entire life living in your father's house. You'll feed on your father's earnings. No mom, I will earn. I will not marry. Aashti, why are you doing like this! Why have you become an enemy of your life, Aashti? If your father hears this, he'll kill you! He'll kill me too! I will die. Aashti, have mercy, for God's sake have mercy. My child, why are you doing like this? Zarnish, do you know I find the ocean very mysterious. Have you ever seen rain in the open sea? No, I've never seen it. I also like the sea, I find it very fascinating. I'm glad you took some time out to bring me here.   I don't understand why we are letting these small things create distance between us. For you, they might be small things, but not for me! Abrash, what do I do? Sit at home and wait for you. Like a typical housewife, I don't want to be a typical housewife! You do your work, do your activities and me? I just wait for you. What activities do I do? I have no activities, It's just business, of course I have to work.  I myself want to roam with you, come out with you, spend time with you. Whenever we get time, we will go on a trip. Don't talk about roaming around, I'm not interested in that. All I want is some company I hate being alone! I've been surrounded my friends, all of my life. Ok  Done, shall we go out? Come on, come out. [Music] What a place, man! The open sky, the free air, the blue sea. These are the things that make a person forget everything. Come on, let us both promise, alright? We promise that no matter what happens, we will never end our love. What did We had imagined that after marriage, we would stay together,  enjoy life. But what are we doing? We're fighting. We've been fighting since so many days. Now let's decide that we'll never fight again. Ok, now lets promise each other we'll never fight. Now we both with take care of each other, take care of each other's choices. You will do what I want and I will do what you want. Because I don't want to be separated from you. Don't you want that? If I wanted that, I wouldn't have married you. I have some expectations, if they're not fulfilled, then this distance will keep on increasing. If they are fulfilled, then there will be no distance between us. Whatever your expectations are, I will try to fulfill them completely. Alright, I'll try my level best. Promise? Promise. Hey Nazrul, now be quiet. Aashti, betrayed me. I waited so many years for her Now she says she won't marry me. Mujeeb brother, how can I live without Aashti? What type of a man are you? You're crying, bastard. People say that we will kidnap the girl, kill her. You're crying like a child. You've never loved someone, if you had loved like I did then you'd cry too. I don't cry. What’s the point of such love where men end up in tears? Tell me one thing, you were engaged to Aashti, you used to give her gifts, she was happy, then why did she refuse now? I don't know anything, why she refused. You're an absolute fool! There must be a reason why she refused. Think, think! Don't cry. Noor uncle is nowhere to be found, I searched the entire neighborhood. I checked every single house; he's not even in the mosque. Arshad, he must be here somewhere, he didn't come home last night. He was not feeling well as well. Ask his friend Shadab and let me know. Thank you. Shadab uncle is not here as well. He went to fishery, I said at his house, if he comes home then send him, he'll come to you. Thank you, Arshad, you do look for him, find him, ok? Ok, I'll find go and find him, bye. Hey Jamila, did Nurul Amin come? No Razia, I'm getting very worried now. I couldn't sleep the entire night. This father and daughter have made me crazy. Now, how can I get Aashti married forcefully? No Jamila, forced marriage is not lawful. The girl's consent is necessary. Who will make Nurul Amin understand this, he doen't understand. He says that he'll force her marriage. No, marriage does not happen by force, then divorce happens. Divorce is not a good thing. Now, I'm going I'll come again to meet you. If you find Nurul brother, then do let me know. I'll tell you. God will fix all this. Everything will be fine, bye! Hey Shaan, go close the door. Why are you here? After humiliating us so much, why are you sitting here now? Zamani mother, I don't want the relationship to end.  Oh, the relationship has already ended, Noorul Amin. Your daughter has ended the relationship. No, Masood brother, relationships don't end like this. I say, get Nazrul married to my Umeeda. [Music]
