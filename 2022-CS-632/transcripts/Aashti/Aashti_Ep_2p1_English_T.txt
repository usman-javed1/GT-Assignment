[0.80] What happened, why are you crying?
[5.20] Mother, Saeed had gone at night, he hasn't come yet. He hasn't come yet. Where did he go?
[16.48] I don't know. You both had fight? It's just few days and you started to fight with him. No, mother, there
[25.84] was no fight. If there was no fight, then why did he went?
[30.60] I don't know.
[34.00] Okay, quite now. I will check. I am calling Masood
[42.68] I am going
[62.40] B A N G A L A N
[70.44] Hey Faiza Bengalan has come. Hey, not Bengalan, call her maid. Only the lucky ones get
[77.56] such maids. Don't you people feel ashamed, daily you talk such nonsense
[81.76] Why is she not a Bengali? Are we lying? I also have 
[86.44] a Bengali maid in my house. Not one but two maids in my house too and that too is Bengal. By the way, 
[91.60] she is also maid in someone's house. Stop your nonsense. After completing studies, she will become maid.
[97.80] Today I will complain about all of you to the Principal. Hey, we just
[103.28] said Bengali and by the way she is Bengali, right? I am not Bengali, I am Pakistani,
[110.24] Bengali is my language, this is my country. Hey, this country is ours,
[116.44] not yours. You guys go to your Bangladesh talk there in Bengali. This
[120.92] is my country, my parents too are born here, we are Pakistanis, this
[125.92] is our country. But Sindhis do not speak Bengali, nor do Punjabis speak Bengali,
[131.32] we have not even heard Baloch speak Bengali, so how come you are? Bengali is our language,
[137.92] this is our country, got it? I am Pakistani, not Bengali.
[145.88] Just watch what I do with you all today.
[153.39]  
[157.28] Mother, you are hurting me. Just be quiet. Your head is full of lice's. I can't clean my head
[163.84] Keep your head straight. Where is your brother? I don't know where he is, few minutes before he was here. Call him
[171.44] I will not call him, he teases me. He doesn't listen to me.
[177.80] Mother, when you leave, he teases me and Aashti sister is also not around.
[185.04] If I will not work then from where we will eat? I don't know but my heart doesn't feel good
[189.72]  
[193.64] Give this to me. Keep your head straight. It is straight.
[201.98]

[216.44] I am coming, I am coming in a short time, now the bus has come.
[220.72] Asalam alikum. Walikum asalam, why did you come here? Look what I
[226.56] have brought for you. What is this? It's a locket. What was the need of it? What are you talking?
[233.56] I am your husband, if I don't bring it then who will bring it, I still have to bring a lot.
[237.88] Nazrul, you are not my husband, you are just my fiancé, that's it. 
[244.64] I am your fiancé right now, but in a few days, I will become your husband.
[249.88] Once you will become then give me this all. Okay then come with me, I have not come to take you. No, I have a lot of work,
[257.12] It's off now, all girls are going, what will you do alone? None of your concern
[262.08] my practical is still left.
[271.60] Don't worry, just relax!
[285.64] Where were you? Where were you?Nazrul has been wayward since childhood, how you
[294.76] learned this all?
[297.16] Tell me, where were you, why don't you answer?
[301.92] Where were you? Don't you feel ashamed, the new
[310.20] bride has been alone all night, can't you hear?
[315.76] What am I asking? I can't live in this house.
[320.32] What do you mean? This house is bitting you 
[325.52] or you have lost your mind? You had fight with Aqeela?
[332.84] Or Aqeela was fighting with you? Tell me, I will handle her.
[338.00] Mother, I did not say anything. Can't you hear?
[345.84] Say something? Are you deaf? Hey, you guys become deaf when I said that I
[353.76] don't want a working maid. Why did you bring her?
[360.36] Saeed, what has happened to you? So, what if she is a working maid? All women do this.
[367.08] I also do household work. Don't talk about yourself mother, you are grown up.
[372.72] A girl who works in home is not good. People consider them bad.
[380.04] Aqeela's boss gives her many gifts, did he give charity in the name of Allah?
[385.92] Clothes, Jewelry and many more, he gives for free? She say, he
[392.80] took a photo, Am I crazy? Am I shameless? I don't understand these things. Hey, you are a fool 
[398.76] All women here work like this. 
[404.68] Boss pays the right of our hard work,
[409.96] gives us clothes and jewelry. Jamila also gets, Aashti too, what is wrong in this, everyone gives. 
[417.00] I don't want this type of bride. I can't live with her.
[422.72] I divorce Aqeela. Shameless, you will divorce her?
[432.56] Mother ... Aqeela ... Aqeela ... Hey Saeed ... Where are you going?
[441.60] Hey, where were you? I have gone crazy searching for you,
[447.20] where are you going? Don't touch me. I am going.
[450.64] Come inside.
[457.12] I will go after washing the utensils to madam's house, otherwise she will get angry,
[463.96] When Aashti comes tell her to wash clothes. Okay ... I will tell her.
[472.68] You stop ... Coming!
[477.76] Are you intending to break the door? Have some patience.
[484.36] Be quick, new bride is unconscious, quarrel going on at Zamani Maa house. Quarrel? Who is doing this all?
[491.79] Zamani Maa and Masood uncle are hitting Saeed. Come quick ... Hey Umeda, shut the door.

[522.12] After staying together for 4 days, he is giving a divorce. He will bring shame on us.
[531.76] Aqeela ... Hey Aqeela... Hey, Masood brother what are you doing? Raising hands on a grownup son. Ask him what he
[541.16] did with us. What is he doing with his wife, ask him. Hey Masood, leave him. Check her.
[548.48] Aqeela is unconscious. Hey, take her to the doctor quickly. If she died, the police
[555.08] will come, he will go to jail. Take her first.
[562.92] What happened to her? Hey, Aqeela ... Aqeela ... Open your eyes.
[577.80] I'll come back and face you
[583.96] You will get beaten by everyone. You will make us humiliated in front of everyone.
[592.92] What do you think, is marriage just about the turmeric color? You apply it, wash it off, and it's over.
[596.51] What all did she do? Did she steal or rob that you want to divorce her.
[601.52] I will divorce her. It's my decision, and I don't care about the consequences.
[612.96] They got me married to the maid. Am I ...
[620.28] a mad person .... Am I a mad?
[627.68] I have forbidden ... I don't want a maid.
[636.64] No one listened to me.
[641.76] I am crazy
[647.00] They respect only Nazrul ... I am worthless
[652.45] [Music]
[668.84] Everyone made a fool out of me
[673.96] They got me married to the maid; she works in a house. She works in Boss house.
[678.08] Am I a fool?
[682.84] [Mummering]
[691.64] Stop crying Aqeela what has happened? Nothing will happen. Sit down.
[699.40] You stay at Jamila's house. Mother, take me along with you, don't leave me here.
[704.84] He has gone mad, first we will talk to him.
[710.92] First, we will straighten him out, and then we'll take you home. I have called Meezan Baba, he
[715.92] will put his mind right, you don't have to worry,
[719.84] Jamila, take care of Aqeela. What are you talking about? Aqeela is like my daughters.
[728.68] Now don't cry, I am leaving.
[734.32] I haven't done anything.
[738.99] Why are you asking me, ask her what happened? She used to work in the house.
[746.02]  She says, Boss give her money, Boss gives her clothes. I have already told mother; I don't want a maid.
[755.40] Everyone works, Boss gives to everyone,
[761.56] my wife also works. You have no shame Nazrul. I will hit you hard, talking nonsense.
[770.24] You don't want her to work, keep her at home. You can't divorce her. You married for four days?
[779.36] Come on, let's go home. I won't go. Get lost from here.
[784.92] My brother, listen to me. Allah gave you a beautiful wife. She is so
[794.04] beautiful like a fairy. You will divorce her? Now I will not go with you Nazrul. I
[802.56] will not go with you, I will go alone. Listen to me. Do
[809.12] not follow me Nazrul. I you will go home; you will not come home. He is shameless. When my wife will
[819.60] comes to me, I'll make her sit in front of me all the time, say I love you,
[825.16] won't even go to work. 
[830.64] Aashti, today you spoke very well in the seminar, it seemed in some places a bit
[835.84] artificial but still good. I am very happy today, you spoke really well. You
[841.64] know how to speak very well. Asalamalikum. Walikumasalam. Are you going somewhere Abrash? Yes,
[846.92] Okay, drop Aashti on the way. Okay, let's go.
[855.28] Was there any program in your college? How did you come with Mama?
[860.80] Okay, I understood that Mama will be the chief guest there. Look at me, look at me,
[872.12] you have you cried? Why did you stop the car? Please drop me 
[881.20] back to my home. No, I will not take you anywhere unless you
[886.32] tell me. Someone has said something. Someone has said
[891.28] something in the college. Even in the college, people call me Bengali.
[896.92] I have no value. I am maid,
[902.84] and I will be a maid always. I don't have feelings, I don't
[908.68] have brains. I am mad.
[912.36] Sir, rest of the people came from heaven? Do they have two brains? Four eyes?
[920.88] We are poor, that's why
[929.80] Just because
[934.00] we are Bengali? How many times have I explained to you that
[939.72] why do you get involved in people's things? Why do you give importance to such things,
[944.16] these people make fun of everyone, that's why you were crying?
[952.04] Today, I was humiliated in front of so many people, sir
[961.06] I have decided, I will not study further. What do you mean?
[967.27] Why you will not study further? Because,
[971.24] there is no use of it. I am studying, still people calls me maid.
[979.96] She called me up on the stage and told I do the sweeping and mopping at the houses
[987.60] I am a maid. Mama did this?
[994.20] Yes, in five-star hotels seminar, in front of press. I apologize to you on behalf of Mama
[1005.84] and I have told you to study, Mama didn't say to you.
[1010.88] You are studying because of me, then why are you talking like this?
[1023.24] Sir, I am 
[1027.36] are doing it for your sake. Then why are you crying?
[1033.64] Why do you get upset over little things?
[1038.52] I don't want to see you crying. Now smile. Come on quickly smile
[1046.52] Smile!
[1051.84] You are a good girl. Sir, you are very nice.
