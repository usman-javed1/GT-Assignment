[1.60] Hey Saeed, Where's Nazrul? It seems difficult for him to be released.
[6.99] What nonsense are you saying!
[8.22]  What did my Nazrul even do? He is a broker of sending people, here
[12.92] people can't stay in Pakistan, and this scoundrel
[15.39] keeps tricking others into sending them to Europe.
[17.71] You are lying! Why would I lie? Dad will come, ask him.
[23.30] Hey Saeed, aren't you ashamed, talking of your brother like this. 
[26.88] Where did he learn to broker? He knows everything, he knows
[31.06]  how to do all the wrong things, I know Nazrul very well.
[35.31] Why should I feel ashamed, this bastard does something
[38.58]  wrong, humiliates me and I should feel ashamed!, 
[42.00] Now when he'll come home, just gets released once
[45.04] then I'll beat him very hard.
[47.57] Zamani, there's no use of getting angry now, 
[51.93] I'm sure the policemen have made a false case.
[54.80] How can he send someone to Europe! Don't worry, he will come.
[59.65] Mom, aunt Jamila is right,
[62.76] These policemen even put noose around air's neck, 
[66.00] they lock up innocent people. What do you say?
[69.31]  Have you seen air? Huh, puts noose around air's neck!
[76.99] Zamani, now be quiet, pray. My child's gone!
[84.36] Brother Nazrul will come back.
[88.30] Tell me how did you like Murree? you went for the first time right?
[93.40] I've heard Murree is a very beautiful place, 
[96.00] you must've visited the mountains as well.
[98.12] Yes, Shabnam, I used to wish
[102.52] that only me and Abrash went to Murree and no one else.
[108.53] I went because Abrash sir told me to;
[111.78] I didn’t want to see the two of them together.
[119.34] You know, Murree is such a beautiful place, so stunning.
[124.07] Over there, the clouds would come down into my hands, 
[128.53]  and I would get drenched! It felt as if I got drenched in rain.
[134.87] It was so cold there,
[136.79] that when I wrapped myself in a blanket, I would fall asleep
[139.27] as if I had never slept before
[143.53] Even in that sleep, I would dream about Abrash sir.
[151.37] When aunt Jamila told me that you went to Murree with those people,
[155.58] my heart started pounding.
[158.76] I thought, how would Aashti survive?
[161.64] Those people would laugh, talk, and be happy;
[165.64] how would Aashti be happy then?
[169.87] Shabnam, you were right; I cried a lot.
[174.84] When those people were happy, it felt like, 
[180.48] it felt like I would die.
[184.33] But Aashti, you told me that Abrash loves you,
[189.22] that he will marry you, 
[191.53] so then why did he choose Zarnish?
[193.92] [Music]
[200.68] How was I supposed to know, Shabnam, that fate would betray me,
[205.01] or maybe I betrayed myself.
[208.90] Abrash sir has told me that I must take the exam
[212.62] You know, don't you, how could I ever refuse something Abrash sir says?
[218.92] Now uncle will get you married to Nazrul.
[223.38] No Shabnam, I will kill myself but won't marry Nazrul!
[229.49] Do you know that he does shady work!
[232.72] Do you know what happened last night? The police arrested Nazrul.
[237.04] Then Abrash sir bailed him out, and I was very humiliated!
[242.06] By the way, Shabnam, I always pray that if I ever get married,
[246.97] I go to Abrash Sir’s house.
[250.24] Hey, listen to me, let me speak! The money belongs to Mujeeb brother, not me.
[255.37] deposited it for the ID card; I didn't steal anything, I didn't rob anyone!
[259.31] He's lying! He was sending people to Europe.
[262.74] Is Europe your father's property, huh? Look, you're both beating me!
[267.80] Listen to me, that money isn't mine, I'm not lying,
[272.56] I'm telling the truth! I didn't do anything, the police are lying, everyone is lying! 
[276.96] They're all jealous of me. Yes, everyone lies, but you're perfect, aren't you?
[282.00] Why don't you say where the money came from? 
[284.20] I'll tell you where the money came from!
[286.89] He says it's Mujeeb brother's money, so where did this money come from?
[290.24] I found it in his shirt! Now say something! What do you say!
[293.41] Oh, so I'm totally telling the truth, huh? You pig! 
[297.59] Now I’ll tell you where the money came from.
[301.27] Wait, I’ll tell you right now!
[304.64] I’ll tell you right now!
[310.70] Shameless! Hey, now you're raising your hand on a young woman! 
[313.81] Can't you see, he threatened me! I won’t spare him alive!
[317.89] Oh, let it go, let it go! You won’t spare him, huh? 
[321.00] You said that after he's gone!
[322.85] Now what will we do with this money? Shut up now, put it inside. I’ll handle it! 
[327.72]  And Jamila, listen, just get the marriage done quickly, don’t delay any further!
[333.27] Yes brother, yes, you don't worry at all.
[340.20] i'll tell Abrash to call you himself.
[344.15] Yes, indeed, Bye.
[358.21] I was talking with my brother and sister in law on phone.
[363.72] How are they? They were getting a bit worried.
[369.39] Why were they getting worried? He was actually asking that
[374.75] when will Zarnish and Abrash come to London.
[378.35] They just came back from honeymoon,
[381.03]  you should've told them that they'd visit them after 6-8 months.
[385.09] No, they weren't talking about coming in that way.
[388.62] They were asking when are  Abrash and Zarnish settling in London.
[394.10] What? how can this happen Sherry?
[398.72] He's handling my bussiness. Actually, brother wants that,
[402.69] Abrash handles his bussiness in London
[407.84] What difference does it make whether they want it or not?
[410.27] He's handling my bussiness, tell them.
[412.98] So whats the harm in this Ali? Zarnish is their only daughter.
[419.96] So what? don't they know that girls get married
[423.94] and they have to go and live with their in-laws.
[427.03] Sherry, when do I have 10 kids, I have one child only too!
[431.61] He will take care of my business and I have not wedded my son to your house!
[436.37] neither has your brother brought him! Abrash is happy with me in bussiness
[441.73] It is a different thing that if Abrash is saying that if he wants to go, then I will stop him.
[447.00] Ali Alam, I didn't force Abrash into marriage!
[450.80] It was Abrash's wish. You should've thought about this before marriage!
[456.00] When brother said he wants Abrash to handle his bussiness in London
[460.50] What difference does it make whether your brother likes or not?
[464.90] I do not want to separate my son, tell them!
[468.51] Ali Alam, why are you picking fights?
[472.70] I don't have time right now, I don't want to argue with you.
[476.69] But I've my brother that they're coming to London!
[479.52] What! how can you say this?
[483.24] I told you, we'll talk later!
[486.00] [Music]
[497.00] He is saying wrong things! Where does he get so much money from? 
[499.35] Can you get money without work mom?
[501.48] The money isn't his, it's Mujeeb's money!
[504.11] He saved the money for the identity card.
[506.78] He lies to you. Right now, he cries for money,
[510.47] sometimes to his mom, sometimes to his dad! You’re unnecessarily blaming him!
[514.93] I'm not blaming him, I’ll show you!
[520.05] My mind is going crazy! She’s made me mad, I don’t know what she keeps on saying.
[532.01] This phone isn't Rafia’s, Nazrul gave it to me, 
[535.88]  I lied to dad, where did he get it from?
[539.07] Where did he get a phone worth 7-8k from? 
[541.56] You guys are blind, you don’t see anything!
[544.90] Abrash just said someone trapped him, would Abrash lie?
[549.00] Mom, Abrash must have said it like this, I’ll ask him tomorrow. 
[552.81] Why do you say such things? He got released now, end this talk!
[557.38] This talk will not end mom! tomorrow he’ll create a mess again! 
[560.73]  No one asks! Where does he get all this stuff from?
[564.25] Neither you ask, nor his dad, nor Zamani mother!
[568.02] Every day, he wears new shirts, where does he get all this from?
[571.91] I’m telling the truth, mom, you want to ruin my life, right? Go ahead!
[576.20] But then don’t cry later!
[582.47] Is there a dog behind you? Come on, listen to me first and come inside!
[585.94] Bastard, every time you show up, you bring some kind of trouble with you.
[589.66] Alright, tell me, whats the matter?
[592.54] Mujeeb brother, my father is going to come to talk to you.
[596.53] What?! Your father is coming here? Why? Is he planning to raid the place?
[600.78] No, no! Everyone outside already knows what happens inside here. 
[604.42] If he wanted to raid the place, he would’ve done it already.
[609.24] That Anwar-ul-Haq, the guy who used to send people to Europe, has been caught.
[613.47] It’s a huge mess. And now you’ve come here!
[617.64] The police is after you, are you trying to get this place raided too?
[621.59] No, listen to me! The police isn't after me!
[625.36] I was arrested, but then I got released.
[629.05] The problem is, my father found the money I had.
[632.79] He asked me where the money came from.
[635.80] I told him I had collected Rs.8,000 for the ID card,
[638.89] and the rest of the money, Mujeeb brother gave me.
[641.84] So, if my father comes here, you just have to tell him that
[645.09] you gave me that money to keep it safe. That’s it!
[650.54] Are you telling the truth?
[652.45] First of all, you have the decide the issues upon which you want to work.
[656.94] Then you'll have to draft the proposal and select the committee members as well.
[663.30] But Sherry how will I do all this? Whats the big deal in this?
[668.84] You have your sister, your sister in law and then theres Mrs. Hamdani too.
[673.48] Just put these 2-3 names in and register yourself as an NGO.
[677.02] Then make a good proposal and send it to different funding agencies, they
[681.88] will fund you. Sherry you know that
[685.92] my sister and sister in law; both are not interested in this.
[689.40] And besides, they won’t do this anyway.
[692.21] Then don't let them do the work; just call them on the day the funding
[694.66] committee members come and have them attend the meeting, that's it.
[700.66] Alright Sherry, tell me how to make the proposal? The easy way is
[705.22] I will give the number of a professional he will take some money
[709.54] and make the proposal for you.
[713.39] The name of the game is money darling, if theres money, you don't have to worry.
[718.78] It was mentioned only because I was talking to my mom.
[723.16] Dad, how could you think that I would leave you? My darling, I was thinking the same
[727.19] that how could you say this. I have only one child, 
[730.97] if you don't take care of my business, then who will?
[735.29] Well, what does Zarnish say?
[739.25] Zarnish didn’t say anything like that about me having to take care of the business.
[743.21] Yes, she definitely said that she wants to go to London.
[746.86] I told her, ok, whenever you want to go, we'll go.
[751.45] I think this is all Mom's fault, Tahir unlce must've said something to mom.
[757.46] What happened? You uncle called, he talked to Sherry.
[763.60] She promised that she will arrange a talk with Abrash. No, no dad I don't
[767.12] want to get in this fight. You talk to mom, she'll talk to uncle.
[772.12] As far as Zarnish is concerned, if Zarnish wants to go to London, I'll take her. 
[776.31] But is she has such an intention, then she should go alone. 
[780.48] I will not even go with her.
[782.50] Really, I thought you'd support your mother.
[788.89] Dad, how did you even think like this.
[790.75] No, sometimes you believe what you hear.
[795.09] Where is your wife? She gone to a friend's place, she should be back soon.
[801.87] By the way, your wife isn't here as well. Son,  my wife and your wife; both
[805.96] are same type of women.
[808.53] [Music]
[838.55] Hey Nazrul! where are you going?
[841.22] You won’t go anywhere, you won’t even step outside the house.
[846.90] Why won’t he go? How can he stay at home?
[850.86] I to go to work, and he’ll just stay at home? It won't work like this, mom!
[854.35] What do you say. You, shut up!
[856.53] Mother, I’ll be right back, I’m just going out for some work.
[859.99] You’re not going for any work, just stay at home!
[863.27] Then I won’t go to work either! Have you gone mad? Yes, I’ve gone mad! 
[867.60] If he stays at home, then I won’t leave the house either!
[870.29]  Aqeela, take your veil and go inside!
[874.66] Mother, I’ll just be back in 5 minutes, don’t worry.
[879.67] Not even for 5 seconds! If you go, I’ll break your leg, understand?
[885.25] I’ll leave all my work and stay home, then you'll drive me crazy!
[889.13] Yeah, I know what work you'll do!
[891.96] Mother, if you do like this then, I’ll take Aqeela and leave the house!
[896.13] Go, go! Do whatever you want. But I won’t let Nazrul leave the house!
[901.52] Come on, go inside! bastard inside! I told you to go inside.
[907.10] Don't you dare! Only for 5 minutes. Don't you dare, I won't let you go!
[909.92] I will break your leg, how will you go! I know all that you do.
[915.06] Hey Aqeela, wash the utensils! Mom! Shut up!
[920.32] Shameless.
