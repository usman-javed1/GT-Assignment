I don't understand which way the situation will turn, son. If Sherry had arranged this marriage, then I would've blamed her. but it was your choice son. I don't understand, didn't you know about her nature? You've been to London several times, you've met her Didn't you know about her? Dad, I never noticed this in her before; I'm seeing it now. I''ll talk to uncle. No, theres no need to talk to uncle. Sherry should talk. [Music] Aqeela, listen to me. Right now, you have to do one work for me. Somehow, make Aashti drink this bottle of water. How can I make her drink? Just make her drink it somehow, no matter what. How can I make her drink? Hey, do it for your brother's sake, its only a small work. What is happening? What are you saying to her? You've been forbidden talking to Aqeela, right? No, nothing, I was just asking about her health.  Whats happening here? What were you talking to Aqeela about? No, nothing, I just gave her a water bottle. Water! Why did you give her water? I've forbidden you, but still you talk to Aqeela! And you! I've told you not to talk to Nazrul. You'll drink the water! I will kill you! You'll kill him? Have you gone mad! Why did he give Aqeela water! It wasn't for Aqeela, it was for Aashti to drink it. He's a very spiritual elder; it was water blessed by him. Oh, I see! Youâ€™re trying to do magic on my wife? What do you say! Shut up! Take your wife and go inside. And you! Get out of my house! Both fight like enemies! I am going, I'll take my wife too and go! Lets go inside Aqeela. I won't leave you! You've made my life hell. Now your father has given his word over there. He's marrying Nazrul with Umeeda. Dad has lost his mind! Tell him to kill me, to strangle me and finish me! Mom, I'll marry Nazrul brother, you don't cry like this. Shut up! Shameless! Marry him, huh! If you talk like this again, I'll cut off your tounge. You're encouraging your father, go, get lost! [Music] [Singing song] God, you're so bad, you girls are so cheap. I'll tell you what singing is all about. Alright. Show us what you got Z! [Singing song] Sir, I couldn't make her drink the water. The water fell. But the slip you gave me, I brought all the items. Why didn't you make her drink the water! The bottle fell and broke. Broke the bottle! Forgive me! Now I'll give you the water again. This time you won't even make a slight mistake! Listen to me, making her drink the water is very hard. Do something else, whatever you say I'll do it! Do something else. Ok. I'll do something else. But it will cost Rs.7000. I accept it. You said, thursday is the last day, so do everything according to it. I said I'll do it so I'll do it! You sit peacefully.  Burn this amulet under the open sky at midnight.
