[12.38] [Music]
[40.68] Aashti, don't you have to go to college today?
[46.76] No mother, I will not give the exams.
[53.16] Now I don't want to study more. We can only think about everything; but we can't do everything.
[62.40] Why would you end your life. You are having fever; you want to die?
[71.64] Yes, now I will die, what else will I do?
[77.76] There is nothing here, mother
[82.40] No respect, no love, no happiness, what else will I do, I will die at last.
[92.75] Aashti, you can get everything, in your place, in your community,
[100.84] if you look up, you will fall, you will not get anything, now get up.
[109.88] Come with me to the doctor, I have to go to work too, get up. No mother, I will not go to the doctor
[118.29] I don't want to go to the doctor. Aashti, why are you troubling me?
[126.32] Now Nazrul is a good boy, if you say then I will talk to Zamani aunt.
[133.12] When you will get married to him, then you will forget everything. Come on, get up
[140.99] I will not get married mother. If you people force me, then I will die by drowning in the sea
[146.68] I will not marry.
[150.09] You betrayed me. You are earning your livings with me, still you betrayed me.
[157.46] You told Khalil that I make small net. I don't lie. You even give him the sample.
[166.20] I don't lie, I haven't given anything to anyone, I haven't said anything to someone.
[171.96] You're trying to fool me, aren't you ashamed?
[175.48] You are Burmese,
[180.12] You earn your bread in our country, and still, you betray us.
[188.12] You are lying. I am not lying, I swear. I swear on my parents. You are a liar!
[194.24] Masood brother, forgive him. If he was lying, he wouldn't have sworn.  Just forgive him.
[199.28] If you commit such actions like Hitler again, I won't leave you alive
[207.16] By the way, I know he will do this again.  That's why I won't spare him. Hey, you Burmese's! 
[217.76] Wow beautiful, very beautiful. Look Zarnish, how is it? By the way
[223.24] you intend to weigh Zarnish in gold? Father, who is being weighed in what? 
[228.76] They are weighing Zarnish in gold. Okay, you tell me with what will you weigh her?
[234.04] I will weigh her with flowers, I am not rich like you guys, I am a poor man, a simple man.
[238.86] You are richer than he is, infact your daddy's wealth is yours and mine is also yours
[246.96] It means that you are the richest man in the world. Father, all these
[252.08] are things to say. Sister-in-law, is your shopping over or
[256.44] is there still some left? There are still many clothes left to fit, and Zarnish has to buy more
[260.80] dresses. We should keep Mayoon, Mehndi on same day.
[265.92] Good idea! Mother, I have need to buy glass bangles with these dresses.
[271.23] By the way, when is the Mayoon and Mehndi happening?
[276.00] Let's keep Mayoon and Mehndi on Saturday and wedding on Sunday, because there is very little time.
[280.03]  On Sunday? Oh, there's very little time left, I have to go to the tailor
[285.88] and do many other things, listen, don't you want to do shopping? A lot of shopping!
[289.20] Let's go then. Jamila.... I will try all of these and come back. Yes dear, try all of them.
[296.33] Jamila
[300.60] Yes sir. Give me tea and listen why is Aashti not coming?
[309.56] Father, i have stopped Aashti, actually she has her final year exams so I said that she
[314.48] should prepare well. Why did you refuse? Don't you know
[318.96] how much work is there at home and you have made her focus on giving the exam. 
[323.17] Mother, the work is still going on, what happened.
[327.64] Jamila, go make tea and see where Ahmed is and send him here. Ok madam. 
[333.95] I will also change
[340.64] Sir, I wanted to tell you something. Yes, Jamila,
[345.96] Aashti is not giving her exams.
[350.64] Why won't she give the exam? What happened to her? Aashti says, she won't study further
[359.92] But why? Now what can I say sir, if you explain it to her, then she will understand.
[368.92] Ok, I will talk to her myself, I will come to your house some day.
[374.12] Brother Javed, thank you very much. Mashallah, you have done a lot of work for me.
[380.84] Thank Allah, it is all due to Him, that you work got done.
[386.28] Should I tell you one thing Saeed, all of this is your wife's destiny, my mother says
[391.96] that money comes in the wife's destiny, children are in the husband's destiny.
[397.88] Before the wedding, you made so many attempts, but nothing was working out.
[400.78] After the wedding, you made one attempt, and by the grace of God, it all worked out and that too permanent.
[408.19] Yes, you are right, Javid Bhai, my wife is very lucky,
[416.24] Respect your wife, not everyone gets a lucky wife. It's true. Now I have to go.
[425.44] Come on time tomorrow. Ok. Goodbye.
[433.68] Rashid brother, how much is my bill?
[447.27] [Music]
[579.80] Show me a good saree.
[585.28] Show me that one.
[590.08] How much for the saree? Rs 450. That's too much, reduce the price a bit.
[597.18] Its final, give me Rs 440. I will give you Rs 400
[605.75] [Music]
[619.98] Sister Aashti, you have to go to the doctor, you have a very high fever.
[625.41] Umeeda, where is mother? Mother's not at home.  Should I make tea for you? 
[633.76] you can eat it with medicine. Yes. Ok
[651.47] [Music]
[674.56] Can't you guys hear?
[681.96] Greetings! sister Shabnam. When did you come back from Bangladesh today?
[688.83] I came today and came to meet you guys first. Sister Aashti would be very happy after seeing you, Sister Aashti!
[697.48] Sister Aashti! Look who's here, sister Shabnam is back from Bangladesh, look!
[709.17] Aashti. How are you? I am fine.
[720.12] So your shopping is all done. Perfect! Are you happy right?
[724.56] Oh alright. I still have a lot of shopping left. Keep on doing.
[731.20] Where are you going? Sir Aashti's not feeling well, I will get her medicine and come back,
[737.20] Madam hasn't returned from the market yet.
[739.48] Ok, wait for a while, I am coming, I too want to go in the same direction.
[744.66] No sir, I will go on the bus, don't trouble yourself. No, I have to go there anyway.
[749.50] I am coming in a while, you sit.
[756.44] Really, Shabnam, I missed you a lot. You said you would come back after two months
[762.36] but you came after whole 4 months. I also missed you a lot, I had many relatives there
[768.80] but you were not there. So, tell me how was your journey to Bangladesh.
[775.12] It was very good. Alright, now you tell me, any news about your sir?
[780.97] Are you still the one running after him, or has he started coming after you too. I thought you must have gotten married.
[788.16] You must have become the lady of the house.
[793.56] Aashti, why are you crying? What happened?
[801.72] Tell me, what's the matter. Shabnam, its Abrash's mehndi tomorrow
[811.20] and the day after tomorrow, he will get married to another girl.
[819.60] All these big people are only big in name; their hearts are very small.
[828.00] They don't love the poor. Stop crying.
[833.24] Stop crying.
[843.47] Aqeela, look I got a saree for you.
[851.00] When you wear this, you will look very beautiful. It's so beautiful. When you wear it, it will look more beautiful
[862.16] I don't doubt you, I love you a lot,
[870.60] but Nazrul teases me, that is why I told you not to go in front of him,
[879.20] his intention is wrong. Saaed, he is my elder brother,
[885.56] if you call him like this then it will be a mistake, brothers shouldn't speak of each other like this.
[894.44]  Then why does he tease me?
[899.84] Now listen, MashAllah, I got a very good job.
[906.90] Really? Yes really, I will get Rs 5000 as salary. Now no more quarrelling and no spoiling the mood. 
[916.70] I will take you for a ride and treat you with ice cream.
[922.50] I will give you swings, and we'll eat chaat, what do you say?
[929.54] Saeed, you said after so many days, I thought, our life has ended.
[936.24] Hey, where has it ended? It has just started!
[941.26] Saeed, now you won't fight with anyone right? Am I mad that I will fight without any reason. 
[951.12] Saaed, you brought saree for me, but not for mother.
[960.12] I will bring it next month for mother. Saeed, this is wrong. Mother will say, my son, my right
[971.32] brought a saree for his wife but nothing for me. She won't say like this, Zamani mother, isn't like this.
[978.28] I will say it, when i will get my salary next month, I will buy her the saree.
[983.32] Ok, now you go and freshen up, I will bring food for you. Really? Yes, really.
[992.28] Sir, you have caused yourself a lot of trouble by coming here.
[998.84] Come, come.
[1004.00] Greeting, Abrash sir. Greetings! what am I hearing Aashti, after studying for the whole year, you won't give the exam.
[1013.49] Wouldn't all your hard work go to waste? how much loss is this?
[1021.88] That's ok, my benefit is nowhere. Madam is correct, what will we maids get after getting educated?
[1033.37] Isnâ€™t it just sweeping, mopping, and cooking? What are you talking about?
[1038.68] In one day all your views have changed, all your thinking has changed.
[1045.80] Life changes in one breath.
