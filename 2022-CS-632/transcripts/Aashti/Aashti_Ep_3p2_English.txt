[Song] You look beautiful while laughing. I thought that's why your mood was always off because you do not want to marry me. Why won't I want to meet you Nazrul don't rush into getting marriage  Won't you like it when you tell your friends how educated your wife is.  You will like it, and then within this time you will get a job, you get a lot of money, and then we will have a grand wedding. You will like it right? I will like it very much. Oh MashAllah!. You're so wise My father just doesn't understand. Can you please explain it to him that right now don't rush into marriage If you speak so lovingly, I'll delay the marriage by another 2-4 years. Hey Nazrul, you are very good. But I will do all this on one condition. What is that? That you will talk to me with such sweet words every day. Have you gone crazy? How will I talk daily Oh, we will do it on the phone wherelse. Nowadays all lovers talk on phone the entire night. I don't know what they talk about, but they talk all night. Where will so much money come from? Don't worry take it easy. I will bring it now mobile has become so cheap. Ok. You know Masood uncle right, he told father that get her married as soon as possible, now how will you stop him? My father? I will stop him, don't worry, ok. You just  sit comfortably and eat chips. Now I will make our heart happy. Should I sing with the tree? No, no sit and sing. Ok I will sit and sing. [Song] I can't sing while sitting I will have to stand. [Song] Hey, I will eat too. You can eat.  Mother I said nothing to Saeed. He quarrels with me himself. You are right, Aqeela, a good woman should be quiet when man quarrel so  the fight would end. Saaed is a very good child; he is not bad that heart. He's just short tempered. Aqeela. Saeed You will wear this. What's this? I brought veil for Aqeela Saeed will I wear this in the house? Saeed how can I wear this in home? Aqeela!... Have you gone mad, she covers her face in saree then what was the need to buy a veil. I brought it for the need. It is my choice she will not  roam around in the house like this, she will wear a veil. Now you will get beaten by me, everyone will make fun of you. They will laugh at us. When she goes out of the house, then she will wear a veil. Why will she wear it in house Ok, its fine but in the house she will hide her entire face with her saree She will not come in front of Nazrul.  Shameless! you're doubting your brother? I am not doubting him; I know his intentions are wrong. Now Aqeela  if you come in front of him, I will break your legs. Hey, shut up, are you crazy? I have not lost my mind. Hey, what is all this chaos about? What happened to Aqeela. Your son has completely lost his mind. I don't know whom he went on. He doubts his wife and quarrels I didn't do anything. I have said it once she won't come in front of Nazrul. Aqeela, you go inside.  I am going. Hey, where are you going? Talk to me ... Saeed. Father let him go otherwise he will quarrel with me. Now I will explain it to him myself. Now look at his actions. Five people were sent to Europe for one lakh rupees. Without ID card and passport? Anwar ul Haq did all the paperwork. He first took them to Iran then Istanbul then entered Europe. Now he's back and is collecting people. You collect 5 people then I will tell him to send you to Europe in half amount. Now you also see how hard is it over here all the time the police is behind, asking for ID cards. we can't even work anywhere Nazrul Salam, I've never even counted 1 lakh Where will I get so much money from? I don't know this, now if you want to go to Europe then you will have to invest it If you will invest money then you will go to Europe. You will earn in Euro. Euro is bigger than dollar. Now what do I get? 1 thousand rupees for 1 person. What will my benefit be You will go at absolutely half the expense. Only 50 thousand rupees Ok, I'll get something done. Great, now give 5000 rupees and I will get your name written.  If I don't go then? I will give you back your money. I give you my word and swear my  life on it. Come on takeout 5000 rupees. Nazrul Salam I only have 3000 rupees in my pocket Out of this I will give you 2000, I will keep 1000 for my expenses, ok? Yes, its, ok? Right now I will do something. Nazrul Salam you won't cheat with me, right? You will send me to Europe right? I am telling you my work might be shady, but my word is top notch Now don't worry. Hey Bunderi, I want to talk to you Light your cigarette, you are going Europe, you will see foreigners. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I didn't know that you loved me deep in your heart You never told me, when I came to know about it, I couldn't believe it but I am happy I like you [Music] [Laughs] [Music]  Aashti now when will your college end? Why mother? Madam's brother and sister in law have come from abroad. Theres too much work I can not take leave, you know I am having my exams. When they will finish then I will come then. Exam, Exam! I am struck in trouble now.  Mother, do you know which country Madam's brother has come from? How would I know which country is he from Madam said if Aashti leaves her studies and work for her the entire month, then she will give her Rs 5000 per month Aashti, we have 20,000 rupees loan already. You will work for her for 6 months then MashAllah our loan will be repaid. Mother I will not work in anyone's house. Did I educate you so that you won't clean the house? Mother, studying doesn't mean that I will clean someones house.  I will work in someone's office. Who will give you a job in the office? Abrash Sir, he said to me. My opinion is that the nikah should take place first, followed by the rukhsati.  Hey Ali Alam, what are you saying? He is my only son. How could I just marry him off like that. I wanted simplicity. What do you want. I have such a big social circle. I have to invite them all, host dinners. Yes, we will have a grand wedding. Feed guests in gold utensils, otherwise how will people know how rich we are. Ali Alam, don't make fun of everything, first there will be engagement, then there will be shopping, there will be mehendi and all that. Everything will happen with a lot of fanfare, Brother dear, what I am saying is that it is a hassel Okay, but Shery is also saying the right thing. Look, he is your only son, we have only daughter,  We will try to fulfill all our wishes on this wedding Well, it is like that from my side you all have open permission to spend unnecessarily. So, sister-in-law, shall we decide the date of engagement? What is there to decide, we can keep it on next Sunday  It is absolutely fine. Congratulations brother My heart feels that we should ever go to the upper part of Pakistan. Trust me it is such a beautiful place that you will forget even Switzerland. Last time I was there, in Hunza. I have never seen such a scenery you know, in the middle of the mountains and the food available there is amazing, I mean seriously, I feel like going with you someday, so let's go. When? On the honeymoon, after marriage, daddy also says that Pakistan is very beautiful. So rather than going abroad we will go to Pakistan I have seen the whole world anyway. Are you sure? I was thinking that you will say that I want to go to Italy, I want to go to Turkey. I have no problem in going ,but trust me, that place is so beautiful, if you go with me to Muzaffarabad or Murree or anywhere else, you will go crazy, okay listen to me, we are talking about marriage, let's go inside and find out our date is getting fixed or not? Let's go and find out! I want it to happen as soon as possible. It's better. Look, I don't want to see you crying. Now, well done, smile, come on quickly, smile, smile  [Music] Hey Aashti are you sleeping or are you dead? What happened mother? You don't have to go to college? I have to. Then get up and make breakfast. Can't you make it? Stop being bossy Umeda is not feeling well she's not letting me work Now go make breakfast for your father, otherwise he won't let me go to work. Come on, get up What mother! Come on, be quick!   Aashti, I am feeling very threatened, you do one thing, tell Abrash everything clearly. Whatever has to happen, it will happen once and for all. Yes, Rafia, I too am feeling very scared.  Although I told Nazrul to stop the marriage, but I don't trust him. Thats why I am saying that you've unnecessarily delayed the matter. Tell Abrash to bring his family members to your house, your parents will themselves agree, you think for yourself. Where is Abrash and where is Nazrul? There's a world of difference between the two I also think that I should tell it to Abrash. Day after tomorrow its Sunday right, I will go over and tell him Now you will wait for Sunday,  just call him. I am not going to talk about this on the phone, When I will go to his house then I will talk. Ok as per your wish, hey look isn't that your Nazr. Oh, what a problem! I have told him 10 times not to come to college, then he comes again Don't look over there. If I don't look then it will be a problem, I am going. I will come after some time, let me talk to him. Come quickly. [Music] Why did you come here, do you want to get me out of the college? Greetings Greetings. I came here to give you the phone, now I will teach you how to use it.  Nazrul, I don't want this, you go now, if the principal sees it, then I will be expelled from the college. Just listen to me for a minute, look at my picture,  I took it myself, my picture is also there, press this button, my name will come; Nazrul, my number is also there, whenever you feel like talking to me. Just press this button, then press this, then you can talk to me, hang up now, otherwise you will call. You go now. I know everything, go. You are looking very good today. Has he gone? Yes he went, he came to give me this phone. Hey show me, this is an expensive phone I don't know where he gets so much money from. Must have earned it from doing shady work, do you know why he gave the phone, he says,  I will talk to you on the phone all night. He's crazy. Come on, what is your business? Your work is done Hey yes, my work is done, I will call Abrash sir first. Yes and tell him everything. Open this, how should I dial? Greetings, who is this? Yes Aashti. This is my phone; I need to talk to you about something very important [Music]
