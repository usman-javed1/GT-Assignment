[31.32] Talking to Zarnish, means to blow the horn in front of the buffalo.

[36.80] but it had no effect on her. Mummy, you spoke to Tahir uncle?
[42.44] Yes, but he is in Zarnish's favor. Okay, you ask Jani clearly whether she

[124.33] and what kind of mother are you? It's been years, now your daughter
[132.48] says, she will not get married? other country, Ramay, which day
[139.84] is the engagement to be held, then it just happens that you explain it to Aati,
