This girl has come from another country, she has left her home, has left her family. Her family, her house, are these people. You are her everything. She used to work for the sake of her food, all women in our Bengali community work to make ends meet She was alone with mother; what else could she do for the sake of her stomach? You were giving him something to her? Whatever happened, happened. Now she has no connections with her Boss Divorce is a very bad thing. In our religion, giving divorce is considered very bad Allah gets angry, the Prophet is not happy, and the devil is very happy, Being unkind weakens faith. You will say don't work, she won't work, If you ask her to cover herself, she will do so. Aqeela is a very good girl. Now you will understand, okay. Do one thing, go in your room. Come on ... Go! Zamani, do one thing leave Aqeela for few days at Jamila's house, he will cool down, he just had fight don't bring her back now. Otherwise, he will again fight. Once he will realize then bring her back Now, I am leaving Walikum salam.  Don't worry, everything will be fine. Saeed is kind-hearted, and I don't know why he's saying that. I used to work, I did not commit any sin, How can I fill my stomach?  My mother was sick, and I had to get her treatment. If I hadn't paid the rent, where would I have stayed? My boss was like my father. He give me everything because my father died. He did wrong? An old man, very old man, father of five. All grown up kids. His wife made dresses for me. He is harsh with me for no reason I am innocent. Now be quiet, how long will you cry? Allah will fix everything How long you will cry? Saeed is angry at me. Saeed will be fine. Aqeela, you are still crying? My child, quite now. You neither slept at night nor during the day. Did not had food in afternoon, still has not eaten, quite now. Aashti, bring something for her to eat. Okay mother. Don't cry, it's okay, just listen to me, see, it happens, you have fight with husbands, why are you crying. I haven't done anything. I know you haven't done anything. [Music]  [Music] [Music] Make a small net. Masood Bhai, this is a small trap, if you make it smaller, it will cause trouble, it is forbidden, if anyone sees it then? Hey, who will see? If someone tells, it will be from one of us If you don't make the net smaller, how will you catch the fish? How we will make money? The Chinese trawler that is standing in the sea, it takes all the fish, either big or small no one asks them. Government has closed its eyes, Whoever comes from outside as a fisherman, takes our fish, no one ask. Now be quick Now we will catch fish on this net. In big net, how many fishes we can catch? Four! only four! If someone betrays, I will tie them up with this net and throw them into the sea Did you understand? Yes! Rafia, I decided that now I will not come to college but Abrash Sir said. What he said? He must have said long dialogues. No, he said, you are studying for my sake; you are doing this all for me and said, don't cry now. You were crying? Yes, I felt insulted, I started crying right there, do you know Rafia, Abrash, you wiped my tears with his hand. What a romantic scene it will be. Well, tell me further, then what happened next? On the way, he asked me when will you come home and said, don't do cleaning and mopping any more. I said, I will clean your room. Honestly Rafia, it feels good to do his work. I wish that day never end. But you have fianc√© also, what was his name, Nazar ... Nazrul Islam. I don't like him even a bit, perhaps I will never marry him, I will marry only Abrash sir and I am sure that Abrash sir loves me a lot and he will convince his parents. I am only afraid of his mother, Sherry Alam. By the way, marriage is not fun unless there is adventure and suspense. Arrange marriages are boring.  Whereas your marriage will be full of suspense, excitement and adventure. You know what will happen. Abrah's mother will say No, this marriage cannot happen, then you know what Abrash will do. He will climb walls of his house will come straight to your house and you know what he will say to you, let's run away and then you both will go for the court marriage and after that you will become his bride. Nothing like this will happen, nor will he run away, neither me. Rafia,  pray for me that a miracle happen that I go and settle down in his house. Asalam alikum ... Walikum Asalam. Look, your mother's pictures have been printed in almost eight newspapers and all the seminars' details are written too. Good! Every day someone is after me to come as the chief guest of the seminar, but you know that I do not have time. Ali Alam, if you had come to the seminar, you would have known how much I am being praised there and many reputable ladies were there, by the way Shaista had also come. If you had told me that so many  ladies are coming and especially Miss Shaista, I would have left all the work and reached there. Do you come there just for Shaista?. I swear to God, just for you. Ali Alam, do you remember how many interviews I had when the earthquake happened in newspapers, even BBC had interviewed me, I had also given an interview to them, I don't know when it will come on-air. Mom, tell me one thing, when Baba and I sit at home and talk about business, you feel bad. You start scolding us that why do you people sit at home and talk about business and you yourself are talking about NGO. You should feel proud son that your mother is praised so much. But you yourself have said that there should be some different talks in the house too. I have some different things to talk. Really, you have some different things to talk?  Tahir Brother and his wife are coming from London. I had completely forgotten, I will call them after having tea. Abrash, do read the interview of this newspaper, it has all the details about my seminar tomorrow. Mummy, I will read but, tell me one thing. Yes, ask. You took Aashti with you. Hey, you took Aashti with you? Yes Baba, Mummy took her along with her too and in front of the people and the press,  she introduced her that she sweeps our house and that she also teaching Aashti. So, what wrong did I do? Did I lie? Mom, she is studying herself, you are not teaching and then that in front of people calling her and telling that she sweeps ... It means that Aashti has complained about me to you. No, she has not complained. I myself was asking her what happened at that event and she was saying. Okay, don't give justifications to me. I understand everything I am not coming tomorrow. Why? It's my cousin's birthday. How old is she? She is nine, she is so cute, I will bring her to meet you Yes, definitely bring her. I buy a teddy bear for her. Your Majno is again here. Asalamalikum how many times have I refused you, don't come to my college, you come again. Hey, why are you getting angry, look I borrowed motorcycle from my friend, I will take you around the whole city, now let's go to the park. You are crazy, I am not going with you. You said to me you will go after the wedding, that day I brought the locket, you refused, said, I will take it when you will become my husband, now I will do one thing, I will go immediately and tell mother to marry me tomorrow to Aashti. No, No okay, by the way, Nazrul, these days you have started teasing me. Don't delay, I have to go  with mother somewhere, then if I get late from college then father gets very angry. Oh, that's why I am saying that you should marry me quickly, then neither your father will be angry, nor my father will be angry, nor our father's father will be angry. Now sit. Don't let me fall. Hold on to me and sit. I am very scared. There is nothing to be afraid of. Hold me. I will fall. You won't. Hold me tightly [Song] [Song] [Song] Give her something to eat, will you let her go hungry? Here you go, cold ice cream. It's very tasty, try it. Hey Nazrul, I did not say to you to bring. Hey, what are you talking about? Listen to me A good husband gives his wife everything without asking I have already eaten, it's very tasty. Shall I tell you one thing, last night I had a dream You came in my dream, I saw you In my dream, you were softly running your fingers through my hair to wake me, talking sweetly, to me, I liked it very much. If it happens in real, it would be so nice. You will make tea for me. Sometimes you will fight also with me.  You will also talk sweetly. I am going to say to mother to arrange our marriage immediately. Nazrul, again you have started talking nonsense. Right now, you are jobless you are roaming all day. Eight months are left in my exams, should I leave my degree incomplete? Hey, when I said this, you can complete your degree after marriage too. You know nothing about the job, wherever I go, they ask for ID card and you know that we are Bengalis and ID cards are not issued to us. You know how to cook? Chinese Pakistani and many more, you teach me. I'll go to a big hotel and will become ... Cook. Nazrul, I don't know how to cook. Now let's go, I am getting late. Why are you in such a hurry? Let's go there. in the water, it will be fun. No, I don't want to go. I have to go with mother at boss house. I am getting late, let's go quickly. First you promise, you will come again with me. I will come again. Finish the ice cream first. I don't want to eat. If you are not eating, then I am also not eating. Let's go home. Okay, let's go. Give this to me. No, I can hold.   [Song] [Song]  Haye, I am going. You know, I go in the morning at work. I comes at 12 o'clock in the night, you know, when the order of furniture comes, sir says finish it otherwise he deducts money and Jamila says to me that you are not working. Noor ul Amin inflation is increased, what shall we do? The woman is crying in every house. Masood brother I want Aashti's wedding to be arranged soon, you give one final date. Nurul Amin, I used to think that you yourself are delaying as her degree in not completed yet. Jamila said to me, exams are not done. Masood brother, enough of her exams. Now, you bring the wedding procession and take her. Zamani said to me many times, even Nazrul also said to me. But I said to them to wait Now you are saying then Okay. I'll talk to Zamani. You start preparation from your side. Our preparations are complete!
