[192.00] at her finger, whether they're equal.

[208.24] truly God's blessing, its very good.
[215.64] Shabnam, do you like Urdu song or Bengali song?
[220.08] I like Bengali songs because they are in our language.
[224.26] I like Bengali songs only.

[230.28] Urdu songs are good but I only sing Bengali songs.
[233.62] Can you sing? Yes, I know a bit.

[315.68] Now you are very happy!
[318.86]  I pray to God to keep you happy in your house.
[399.67] Now you don't have to get up from the bed,
[402.00] otherwise I know it's going to swell a lot.
[409.20] And I am sorry for that, 
[410.97] please don't take offense over Zarnish's words.
[415.09] She talks like this, she's like that.
[420.00] No,I didn't mind anything, she just got angry,
[428.97] I know, she's short tempered.
[434.56] Do you want anything? 
[437.80] No, I don't want anything, I will get it myself.
[443.19] You go, otherwise madam will get upset.
[446.90]  Should I make tea for madam?
[450.53] No, you rest, I told you just to rest, that's it.
[461.71] [Music]
[506.96] Don't you dare touch me! What happened to you? 
[511.67] Why are you behaving like this?
[513.57] So much sympathy with a maid? 
[516.44] or is she more than a maid for you?
[518.48] Now you've seen it with your own eyes,
[522.24] Earlier I used to hide from this fact,
[525.56]  I hated myself for thinking like this.
[528.19] But now I understood the entire matter. 
[532.97] You didn't understand anything!
[535.11] I don't think you've been able to understand me up till now! 
[538.90] I know there's jealousy in love
[540.88] but you have crossed the limit. 
[545.77] Aren't you ashamed that you're comparing yourself to Aashti? 
[549.21] With that maid! Would I compare myself with that filthy maid!
[553.63] I don't understand why you're getting so upset. 
[556.37] She's hurt right? and that too because of you.
[558.18] What disaster would’ve happened if I’d taken her stuff?
[562.47] It’s not about the luggage; 
[565.23] you were having fun taking her pictures
[568.14] Oh God.
[572.46] So what if I took her pictures? 
[575.04] Look, she’s here with us, isn’t she? 
[577.79] While I took your pictures, 
[579.35] she watched us with such longing it made me feel sorry for her
[581.52] so I took her pictures. 
[583.84] Do you know the doctor had forbidden her to keep her legs down,
[586.28] her legs were so swollen, how does she walk, 
[588.73] how does she get down!
[590.17] Walking sticks are available in the market. 
[592.48] When did I go to the market? when I'll go then I'll get it.
[596.07] Now please get fine, why are you ruining your mood, don't do like this. 
[599.51] Abrash, I am not one of those typical possessive wives
[604.48] but I don't know,
[606.75] seeing your sympathy for her to such an extent 
[609.36] makes me feel deeply hurt. Alright, that's it, stop
[612.00] I know you're very hurt. Will you drink coffee?
[614.95]  I will make you such a coffee
[617.20] with my own hands, I will pour all my love and affection into it.
[621.30] Then you'll be completely fine, you will forget everything, okay, 
[624.41] I'll be right back.
[637.73] Hello, Jimmy.
[643.20] I'm ok, no no everything is fine.
[648.41]  We've come to Nathiagali for the honeymoon.
[667.92] Take, drink this coffee.
[672.00] Did you make the coffee yourself?
[677.40] You could have told me, I would have made it for you 
[681.84] and then why did you make it for me?
[686.29] Why? Can't I make coffee for you? 
[689.82] Zarnish and I also wanted to drink, you also drink it 
[693.16] and try it, I can make better coffee then you!
[696.25] Take some pills along with it, your pain will also reduce, 
[699.63] ok you will enjoy too.
[714.36] Where Jimmy, I'm so busy, I haven't met anyone!
[720.76] you know, those dinners and all those formalities.
[725.60] When you'll come then we'll meet everyone. 
[729.71] Ok, take care, bye! Coffee's ready!
[733.70] Darling, there you go! Mood's fine?
[737.76] Good, who were you talking with?
[742.25] You know, Jimmy, my childhood friend, he called me
[751.64] He is very fond of visiting Pakistan, 
[754.02] you know he wants to go to all these historical.
[756.57] He was saying hi though,
[760.00]  you know Abrash, hes completely different from you,
[763.69]  totally opposite, completely non-serious, never practical,
[768.73]  keeps laughing, keeps making people laugh wherever he is,
[773.01]  a crowd gathers. Wow 
[778.09] When you praise a man, I feel very bad by the way
[783.10] Ok, now you're being hurt, how chauvinistic!
[789.82] What can I do? When the wife is lovely, one has to be a bit chauvinistic.
[795.99] Lovely coffee though. I know right.
[811.55] Aashti's very lucky, she went to the mountains right.
[817.11] Shabnam told me there houses on mountains too
[822.22] Murree! Aashti went to Murree right? Yes, she went to Murree.
[826.33] Murree is indeed very pretty, truly beautiful.
[831.20] Saeed, take me too! I haven't seen anything
[836.83] only saw the sea and the zoo,
[840.29]  you said you're going to take me to Quaid-e-Azam's monument,
[844.36] you didn't even take me there!
[846.89]  I will take You Aqeela. And Murree?
[851.38] How can I take you to Murree Aqeela? 
[855.09] I don't have any money!
[857.26] The expenses for hotels, food, and everything else there, 
[860.99] we don't have so much money Aqeela
[862.94] First we'll save up, then we'll go,
[865.54]  I haven't seen Murree either! What do you say.
[868.04] Saeed, in our Chittagong, there are huge mountains, 
[872.48] our Bangladesh is very beautiful.
[875.52] There are hill trucks there too. 
[878.45] Mom told me that she will take me hill trucks.
[882.76] Mom did not have money, 
[885.89] so she told me that when you'll get married
[889.12] then go with your husband. I will take you, don't worry!
[896.34] You'll take me on the plane right? 
[899.38] How can we go on the plane Aqeela?
[902.31] Planes are very costly, we’ll travel by train,
[906.90]  seeing the whole country along the way. It’ll be so much fun!
