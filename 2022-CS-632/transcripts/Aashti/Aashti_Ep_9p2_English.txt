What do you say! [Music] Don't come back home until I return, shameless! You are so good! what do you say! Hey! [Music] Aqeela! I am going. Remove the veil from your face [Music] [Music] Mr. Mukhtar, this is our new setup. But now we are getting interested in exports as well. Very good Mr. Abrash, I'm very impressed with your work. There's a huge demand for this type of furniture all over the world.  Look, I have a place in Dubai, there are more showrooms there as well. I think if you're interested then you should visit there. And as for the matter of exports in the world, that's exactly what we do! That's why I wanted to work with you Mr. Mukhtar. Actually, no one else can be trusted as much as you! God willingly, have a lot of contacts as well.  Thank you very much for your trust, Mr. Alam. I have a partner, Mr. Bhatti, but I would like my partner in this work to be Arash. Ok, we can talk about partnership later also. Now what you do is, take our catalog and choose the designs you like from it. Let us know, and we will provide you with a presentation accordingly. And as far as the matter of this partnership is concerned,  I am personally against it. In a partnership, a person definitely works for someone else, whereas one’s own work is one’s own, and the profit or loss is also one’s own. However, Mr. Mukhtar because of the longstanding relations with you and your father, and I level of trust I have on you is unparalleled I believe that working with you would be beneficial for us.  so I am not against this partnership. Thank you very much Mr. Alam. You see, money is just a worldly thing; it comes and goes. Mr. Alam, I would like the designs of this furniture to be prepared here. Yes, definitely,  you will get all the designs from here, we will do the designing ourselves. But the best things is that our wood quality is 100% guaranteed, will not get this quality anywhere else. Yes, I'm really excited that you're coming. We all are, yes, yes, I've talked to everyone, we all are. Looking I talked to Nimi, I talked to Shiraz. We all are looking forward to you coming here. We're going to have a party! No, no, you'll love my in-laws, they're so cool, especially and Abrash; he's so chill, why do you worry? Ok. Yes, you'll really like my husband, he's so cool. Jimmy I am married now, ok stop it. Ok, alright, you're better then he is. I love you, ok if it makes you happy then I love you more than I love him, happy? now go, take care, bye! He's mad! Whose phone was it Zarnish? Pippy, it was my friend Jimmy, from London. So such informality with him? Pipy, what happened to you? We are informal,  which is why we speak informally. Come on, Pipy.

Hey, be quiet, you're going to fall!   Is your college at night now?  Where were you? You'll ruin my reputation! Ask me where she went. Why would I ask you? She left for college in the morning and came back at night! After college, she went to madam's house to work Madam will now give her Rs.2,500 as salary! You were the one who said she should work, and now that she's working, you're complaining! You go inside! inside, I am tired. Why did he say that he will not give Rs 5000, Why 2500? didn't she say that she would give Rs.5000 as salary? She will give Rs.5000 for the whole day. Now she'll go after college, work at night,  and earn Rs.2,500, for now, that's enough.  Why didn’t she quit college? I’ll make her quit. Yelling like this every day at a young child doesn’t look good. I’ll make her understand, you understand! Alright, ok, I am hungry, give me some rice. I will get it right away. Mom, come here! Listen to me. I am coming, be patient. Sit here mom! Can't you come outside? I can't come, if I said it in front of dad, you'd accuse me of making a scene!  Explain to Nazrul, he came to my college today. If he comes again, I’ll beat him in the middle of the road! Be quiet, your father will hear. Why didn't you tell me on the way? tell me, what did he say?  He asks me how I went to Murree without his permission! Does he think he's, my father? Enough, be quiet,  I've had a lot of fight with Zamani mother too. She even hit Nazrul. That's it, it’s over, let it go! The conversation isn’t finished, I’ve said it! If he comes again, I'll hit him with shoes! Be quiet, I'll give your father food and come back. [Music] Aqeela, go and sit inside, what do you say. Go and sit inside! Hey Saeed, why are you making such a scene? Dad, if Nazrul stays in the house then I will not go out of the house, nor will I bring Aqeela in front of him! Alright. Hey Nazrul, get up! Get ready quickly. You have to go with me to the sea, you'll have to work. I won't let you sit and eat! What do you say now! You have to get ready in 5 minutes! Only in 5 minutes! Come on, get up, shameless! What do you say! Where are you going? Zarnish, I'm sorry. Trust me, if I didn't have to go on the business dinner, then I would've definitely gone with you, seriously. Even if you didn't have to go on business, even then you would have had some plan. I have no plans today. I don't have to go anywhere today. Today, when I'll come back then I'll only go with you You tell me, where do you want to go. Wherever you want to go, we'll go, ok?  Now get fine, hey, what happened, look at me. Why are you angry? I'm getting late for office, ok. Keep your mood fine, when I come ok? [Music] Hey Nazrul, what are you doing with the mobile? Sit here and learn how to sail the boat. What's a boat anyway, I ride a motorcyle! You can't even catch a fish and rides a motorcycle! I don’t catch the fish myself. When I see it struggling, my heart hurts.  he's being clever. You won't feel any pain. Nazrul, if anything goes wrong here, I’ll leave the fish and throw you into this net and toss you into the sea! I won't feel any pain. Understood? Yes, yes, you don't worry, relax. [Music] Now things will be fine. Nazrul will work with Masood, at least he won’t get into any fights! Mom, if you get Nazrul brother married, then all these problems will also end. These two brothers keep fighting all the time. Your husband is completely crazy!  Well, he is, so what can we do? You should talk about the marriage. I’ve been thinking about it since yesterday. Today, when Masood comes home, I’ll take some sweets to Jamila's house. and get a final date fixed today If Aashti sister comes here, then my heart will also be at ease. and then the fights between these 2 brothers will end too. I’ll go; I’ll go today! Nazrul also kept bothering me all night, telling me to arrange his marriage this month. I’ll arrange it and get rid of him! Now you go and put this in water, I'm coming. Ok.
