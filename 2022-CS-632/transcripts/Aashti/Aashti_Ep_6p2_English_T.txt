[2.61] [Music]
[16.13] Do you like jewelry? 
[19.69] Well, every girl loves it anyway.
[22.77] I'll get it for you from here; 
[25.38] be thankful that Zarnish didn't see you.
[27.44] If she had seen, she would have made a big fuss. 
[30.00] She's feeling cold; will you give this jacket?
[40.73] Listen, you're looking good.
[56.85] Listen, you're looking good.
[65.54] [Music]
[78.12] Hey Aqeela, look at this monkey! What is it doing? 
[81.61] Its hands are so small! Absolutely small!
[84.66] I'm going to feed it now, just watch.
[86.28] You know, in my childhood, my mom used to tell me, 
[89.04] there's blessing in movement.
[90.28] I didn’t know even monkeys understood this!
[93.00] Saeed, what kind of move is it doing? 
[96.21] Oh, just look at what it's doing!
[98.43] What are you doing right now, Aqeela? 
[101.42] Cover your face! Cover it! 
[103.37] Who’s going to look at me now besides the monkey?
[107.11] Oh Aqeela, you don’t know, this monkey was once a human too. 
[110.68] Now look, put on your veil—don’t trust anyone!
[114.66] Not even the monkey? Not on anyone at all!
[116.67] I said don’t trust anyone, whether it’s a human or an animal!
[122.42] Saeed, in my Bangladesh, there are such big, fat monkeys!
[126.77] The government said not to feed the animals.
[130.20] Oh, Aqeela, they must be saying that because of poverty, 
[132.74] do you understand!
[134.63] Now quickly put on your veil!
[139.76] Saeed, I'm hungry. Oh really? What will you eat, Aqeela?
[146.76] I will eat chickpea chaat. You'll eat chickpea chaat? 
[151.61] Then who will look at the bear?
[153.34]  We'll look at it as well, first, we'll eat chickpea chaat, 
[156.65] then we'll look at the bear, ok?
[159.26] Ok, come on, let me just feed him one last time
[162.17] Come on, come with us.
[167.40] Oh Aqeela, you always argue with me for no reason about the burqa.
[171.89] Even other women here wear burqas too!
[174.31] Saeed, they can still see with their eyes, 
[175.95] but my eyes are completely covered!
[177.07] Now let's not fight Aqeela.
[178.83] Aqeela, now look, we've seen the peacock, 
[181.07] we've seen the monkey, 
[182.66] now we'll see the bear, but first, you'll eat chaat, 
[186.26] and then we'll go to see the bear!
[189.12] Saaed, this place is so dirty!
[193.13] There are a lot of shameless people here, 
[195.20] the government spends so much money,
[196.79] They have placed 100 men but still no one does any work. 
[199.46] Then they don't give us jobs,
[201.99]  they say you're Bengali and you don't have an ID card.
[204.00] Right now, you stay here, 
[206.19] I'll go get some chickpea chaat and come back.
[207.67] Till then, you eat this ok? 
[210.18] And don't remove your veil, Aqeela!
[213.28] I am going. Ok
[217.23] [Music]
[246.42] Hello Aqeela, I brought the chaat, now you can eat it. 
[250.23] Now how can I eat in the veil Saeed? 
[252.44] Will I hold it or eat it?  I'll hold it.
[255.24]  How will you hold it? Will you make a scene? 
[258.14] You hold it, and I'll eat. Won't it make a scene?
[260.66]  I am not eating, that's it. Aqeela, don't argue right now.
[264.12]  Do one thing, turn your face towards the tree.
[268.50] Turn there, come on, turn!
[272.65] Now, eat it. Saeed, now can I remove the veil?
[282.18] Ok, now take it off!
[289.28] Now happy? yes. 
[295.31] Is it good? It's very good.
[299.71] We're getting late, we've been sitting here for so long, 
[302.80] there are so many tasks at home. 
[305.03] Will this madam even show up or not?
[306.81] She will come, she will definitely come, 
[308.83] I've already spoken to her on the phone.
[310.62] She's about to reach. Now, whoever wants to stay here can, 
[314.38] and whoever wants to leave can go,
[316.44]  I think for your well-being.
[317.76] If I wanted, I could have brought women from outside
[319.97]  or even from other villages.
[322.07] Madam, you will give Rs. 500 for sitting in this program, 
[325.10] and you will also get food.
[327.11]  In addition, tea and cake are separate
[330.00] And if you want, you can also take the dinner home.
[333.33]  I think madam has arrived. 
[335.08] You all shouldn't make noise and should sit quietly, Ok?
[338.73] I'll bring her right now. 
[340.92] Sit quietly and don't make any noise. 
[342.48] Has the press arrived? 
[344.68] Yes, this time I've also invited the channel people
[346.82] Good! very good,
[348.33]  has the arrangement for food and drink been made?
[350.26] I've arranged for sweets and biryani in large pots, 
[353.85] and also had goats slaughtered madam. Good.
[358.57] I have ordered TFC for you and the press.
[360.92] Really, is TFC available here? I didn't know. 
[363.93] It's not here, but if the order is large, they deliver it here as well
[368.62] Madam, the press people are also waiting. 
[371.06] Greetings! Madam is here, stand up!
[374.08] The arrangements seem fine to me, greetings!
[380.42] I apologize; I'm a bit late. Everyone sit down, please.
[384.97] Do you know that 
[386.36] when the sun sets behind these mountains, 
[387.95] its orange rays spread 
[389.64] over the roofs of these houses in the valley
[392.03] it looks so beautiful that you can't even imagine. 
[398.61] And when fireflies shine on these mountains at night, 
[401.11] it feels like stars have descended
[403.33]  from the sky and landed on the earth.
[405.44] The silence here speaks. 
[407.45] Have you ever heard the sound of the silence here?
[410.52] What happened? I can't believe that you have done MBA.
[415.60] From your words, it seems like you are no less than a poet. 
[420.00] As if you've have done master's in Urdu literature, 
[423.85] Well, I don't understand what you say
[426.84] but I like listening to it. Because I don't talk to you,
[433.85] I talk to your heart.
[437.57] The heart, may not understand the sound of words, 
[442.69] but it can certainly understand their essence.
[448.06] Here we go again.
[452.80] Look over there, doesn't it look so beautiful? 
[456.00] And look, 
[458.51] have you seen that house? Isn't it beautiful?
[461.18]  Lovely! Shall we go? Yes, we can go.
[464.80] Last time, we discussed the life of a woman
[468.00]  in terms of her choices. This time too,
[470.55]  we will discuss the same topic, I mean, the same subject.
[478.32] A woman can marry of her own free will.
[489.66] Okay, tell me, how many of you here 
[492.43] have married of your own free will?
[498.44] Okay, tell me, who here cannot marry of their own free will?
[503.52] You are laughing a lot.
[506.18]  It seems that you have married for love. 
[509.06] I don't know, when I got married, 
[512.15] I had no idea what marriage even was What is love,
[515.88]  how would we know? I got engaged while playing
[520.62]  then sat in the house and then got married
[524.42]  and then we had children. 
[526.52] What do we know, we are poor people, 
[528.91] we don't know anything. 
[533.47] Hey, Ramte, why are you speaking? 
[535.59] You were supposed to stay quiet,
[537.43] And what I asked you to remember?
[539.20]  I forgot it. You never forget to take money 
[541.73] but forget your work. Now you have to speak, 
[544.53] and you have to say what I asked you to remember. 
[546.17] Ok? come on, speak fast!
[547.35] Can I tell madam? Yes you tell me.
[550.35]  In our society, a woman can't even breathes as per her wish. 
[555.40] So how can she take the decision of marriage 
[558.76] Even though, our religion and our law allow that,
[563.18] a woman can take decisions as per her own wish, 
[567.43] a woman should have the right to make decisions. 
[570.48] A woman's wish should be followed.
[572.90]  [Praise]
[591.36] Always her phone is off! 
[594.72] I've been trying since morning, but the phone is off
[600.96] Greetings dad! Greetings. Greetings Masood. Greetings Zamani.
[611.72] What happened, do you have a cough? Hey Zamani, this time 
[617.28] I've caught a really big and good fish
[619.92] Oh really? MashAllah, we'll get good money.
[623.59]  After eating food, I'll go to the market. Ok.
[627.66] Hey Zamani, get me a glass of water
[631.10] Aqeela! Hey Aqeela!
[634.28] Get your father some water.
[638.19] Money is needed, right? He also has to get married. 
[641.84] If there's no money, how will the marriage happen?
[646.45] Look at him, he will get married now.
[649.04] Mom! Go give food, heat it up.
[652.85] Whose food are you heating? 
[655.10] How did you come back so quickly from work?
[658.83] When have I come quickly?
[661.36]  He stays at home all day, does nothing, 
[664.74] and no one says anything to him.
[667.05] Why is he at home, understand? 
[668.66] My work is not like yours. 
[670.33] I pull the net once that's it, 
[673.28] unlike you who keeps the machine running all day.
[675.89] understand? You're good for nothing!
[679.60] A hundred strikes of a goldsmith
[681.18]  are equal to one strike of a blacksmith
[682.50] Greetings Aunty ... Mother send Biryani
[686.01] Wow, what an amazing aroma! 
[688.21] Hey, leave it! It's for me, did Aashti make it?
[691.01] No, Aashti didn’t make it. She’s gone to Murree,
[694.50]  in an airplane.
[695.85] She went to Murree? What are you talking about?
[698.89] Give the biryani to your father;
[700.60]  he’ll eat it and then go to the market.
[702.11] What she is saying? 
[703.84] How did Aashti go to Murree like that, without my permission?
[706.31] How would I know if she took your permission or not?
[709.39] Umeeda, you go, he's lost his mind, go, go!
[713.43] But how did she even leave the house?
[715.57] So what, does she need to ask you before going somewhere? 
[718.29] She’s still living at her father’s house, 
[721.18] so obviously, she’ll ask her father for permission. 
[723.25] She’s not your wife yet.
[725.43] Even then, how could she go without my permission?
[728.00] Are you even in your senses right now?  
[730.61] You don’t have any rights over her yet; you’re not married.
[734.40] She’s just your fiancée. She went for some work. 
[737.88] I know why she went. Then why didn’t you tell me?
[742.27] Am I your servant to inform you about everything?
[745.27] Why are you unnecessarily stressing, Nazrul?
[748.99] It’s you who gave Aashti this freedom.
[751.40]  I always said, don’t give too much freedom to women. 
[754.32] And now you’re yelling for no reason.
[756.41] I’ll give you a slap! Don’t say anything else!
[759.12] If you dare raise your hand, I’ll break it. 
[763.65] Animal! Talking nonsense like a dog
[768.19] You are mad! Everyone in this house is mad!
[772.67] What am I saying, and what are you all talking about?
[779.92] Do you like jewelry? Well, every girl loves it anyway
[785.56] I will get it for you from here.
[789.72] Listen, you are looking good
[795.65] [Music]
[803.15] If we race, you’ll definitely lose to me.
[806.54] I won’t even race with you
[809.62]  because I’ve already lost to you in another way. 
[812.20] What’s the point of racing with someone
[814.07]  I’ve already surrendered my heart to!
[815.64] Scared already? I’m not scared; I just know.
[822.00] I want us to live life this way—together, 
[824.76] side by side, step for step. 
[826.85] Neither you ahead of me, nor I ahead of you.
[829.68] But it feels like my horse is running faster than you.
[832.18] Oh, dear horse, my wife doesn’t like that! 
[835.92] Slow down, slow down… good boy!
[837.92] Hey Aashti, take our picture!
[841.32] Look how lovely we are looking. Click, Click!
[853.50] [Music]
[877.31] Where did Umeeda disappear? 
[879.30] She took the biryani and still haven’t come back!
[886.05] Where is Aashti? 
[888.00] How are you even talking? I’ll talk however I want,
[889.53] where is Aashti? She’s gone to Murree.
[891.29] How did she go to Murree without my permission?
[893.63] Your permission? Does she even need your permission?
[897.19] Are you, her husband? 
[898.85] She took permission from her father and went for her duty.
[901.86] Oh really? Since when did her duty involve going to Murree?
[905.11] Tell me, is going to Murree with her sir, is part of her duty?
[909.09]  Is going in an airplane, part of her duty? Don't cheat me.
[912.53] Nazrul, don’t cross your limits. Stop arguing with me! 
[917.69] She’s my daughter, and she went with my permission.
[920.12] When she becomes your wife, 
[922.00] then you can talk all you want. For now, get lost!
[924.00] You can’t do this to me! I’m going to prepare for my wedding
[927.52]  I’ll marry her and take her!
[929.00] Then I'll see how she dares to go anywhere without my permission.
