Greetings! Greeting. Razia Aunty, I want to talk to Shabnam.  It would be better if you all go to the room. Come on Jamila, let's go. [Music] Shabnam, how are you? I am fine. Shabnam, have you cut your hair? No, not at all, I haven't cut my hair. Show me, I think you've cut them. My aunt tied it in 2 braids. She said, it will look good. MashAllah my hairs are long. Good, very good. I don't like short hair. Don't do it Jamila! If they see it so it will look bad. One time, let me just see one time. They aren't looking at us. Shabnam, give me this juice, I am very thirsty! [Music] Thank you, you're not going to drink? No, I will drink later, later. Shabnam, will you show me your hand?  I just need to see it for a minute. Hey Razia, he is looking at Shabnam's hand,  at her finger, whether they're equal. I know, I saw it, my daughter is lucky! Sit, sit. Its equal, lucky indeed, it's all God's blessing,  truly God's blessing, its very good. Shabnam, do you like Urdu song or Bengali song? I like Bengali songs because they are in our language. I like Bengali songs only. I also like it very much!  Urdu songs are good but I only sing Bengali songs. Can you sing? Yes, I know a bit. The rest bit will come later,  which song do you like? Could you sing it? [Sings Bengali song] [Sings Bengali song] Congratulations to you! he liked the girl. Congratulations to you as well! Shabnam is your daughter too. Shabnam! [Sings song] Now you are very happy!  I pray to God to keep you happy in your house. Now you don't have to get up from the bed, otherwise I know it's going to swell a lot. And I am sorry for that,  please don't take offense over Zarnish's words. She talks like this, she's like that. No,I didn't mind anything, she just got angry, I know, she's short tempered. Do you want anything?  No, I don't want anything, I will get it myself. You go, otherwise madam will get upset.  Should I make tea for madam? No, you rest, I told you just to rest, that's it. [Music] Don't you dare touch me! What happened to you?  Why are you behaving like this? So much sympathy with a maid?  or is she more than a maid for you? Now you've seen it with your own eyes, Earlier I used to hide from this fact,  I hated myself for thinking like this. But now I understood the entire matter.  You didn't understand anything! I don't think you've been able to understand me up till now!  I know there's jealousy in love but you have crossed the limit.  Aren't you ashamed that you're comparing yourself to Aashti?  With that maid! Would I compare myself with that filthy maid! I don't understand why you're getting so upset.  She's hurt right? and that too because of you. What disaster would’ve happened if I’d taken her stuff? It’s not about the luggage;  you were having fun taking her pictures Oh God. So what if I took her pictures?  Look, she’s here with us, isn’t she?  While I took your pictures,  she watched us with such longing it made me feel sorry for her so I took her pictures.  Do you know the doctor had forbidden her to keep her legs down, her legs were so swollen, how does she walk,  how does she get down! Walking sticks are available in the market.  When did I go to the market? when I'll go then I'll get it. Now please get fine, why are you ruining your mood, don't do like this.  Abrash, I am not one of those typical possessive wives but I don't know, seeing your sympathy for her to such an extent  makes me feel deeply hurt. Alright, that's it, stop I know you're very hurt. Will you drink coffee?  I will make you such a coffee with my own hands, I will pour all my love and affection into it. Then you'll be completely fine, you will forget everything, okay,  I'll be right back. Hello, Jimmy. I'm ok, no no everything is fine.  We've come to Nathiagali for the honeymoon. Take, drink this coffee. Did you make the coffee yourself? You could have told me, I would have made it for you  and then why did you make it for me? Why? Can't I make coffee for you?  Zarnish and I also wanted to drink, you also drink it  and try it, I can make better coffee then you! Take some pills along with it, your pain will also reduce,  ok you will enjoy too. Where Jimmy, I'm so busy, I haven't met anyone! you know, those dinners and all those formalities. When you'll come then we'll meet everyone.  Ok, take care, bye! Coffee's ready! Darling, there you go! Mood's fine? Good, who were you talking with? You know, Jimmy, my childhood friend, he called me He is very fond of visiting Pakistan,  you know he wants to go to all these historical. He was saying hi though,  you know Abrash, hes completely different from you,  totally opposite, completely non-serious, never practical,  keeps laughing, keeps making people laugh wherever he is,  a crowd gathers. Wow  When you praise a man, I feel very bad by the way Ok, now you're being hurt, how chauvinistic! What can I do? When the wife is lovely, one has to be a bit chauvinistic. Lovely coffee though. I know right. Aashti's very lucky, she went to the mountains right. Shabnam told me there houses on mountains too Murree! Aashti went to Murree right? Yes, she went to Murree. Murree is indeed very pretty, truly beautiful. Saeed, take me too! I haven't seen anything only saw the sea and the zoo,  you said you're going to take me to Quaid-e-Azam's monument, you didn't even take me there!  I will take You Aqeela. And Murree? How can I take you to Murree Aqeela?  I don't have any money! The expenses for hotels, food, and everything else there,  we don't have so much money Aqeela First we'll save up, then we'll go,  I haven't seen Murree either! What do you say. Saeed, in our Chittagong, there are huge mountains,  our Bangladesh is very beautiful. There are hill trucks there too.  Mom told me that she will take me hill trucks. Mom did not have money,  so she told me that when you'll get married then go with your husband. I will take you, don't worry! You'll take me on the plane right?  How can we go on the plane Aqeela? Planes are very costly, we’ll travel by train,  seeing the whole country along the way. It’ll be so much fun!
