I am a bad woman, I ruined my children,  my son is a scoundrel; this is what you tell everyone. Umeeda told everything to Nazrul!  He blocked my path, came to my house, stared me in the eye, and questioned me,  how I sent Aashti without his permission. Who is he anyway? He’s not Aashti’s husband, is he?  Now he has humiliated me in the entire neighborhood.  In front of the pan seller, the vendor, the scrap dealer.   he mentioned my daughter's name to everyone. Now, wherever I go, people ask me, "Where is Aashti?"  He insulted me and made a mockery of me. I gave my daughter in marriage, not into slavery.  If Nazrul had spoken this way, you should've told me. I would've broken his leg, but instead, you blame me,  saying that I’m not a good woman and that I spoiled my children.  Yes, you're right, I do speak the truth. You ruined the boy; why didn't you tell him that Aashti is nothing to him yet?  I told him so many times, but he doesn’t understand. He’s crazy! Masood scolded him, he told him  not to speak like that. Ha, Masood scolded him! Now don't worry, I will go talk to him, I’ll break his legs!  Don't get angry like this. How would I not be angry!  He blocks me in the street, and I shouldn't be angry? No, not at all! This talk of breaking the relationship is so wrong. It’s been so many years, and my entire family knows  Aashti is my daughter-in-law, your whole family knows I know, because of it, I will never let anyone disrespect me.  No one will disgrace me.  Now let’s end this conversation, Jamila.  I’ll go, I’ll break his head, I’ll hit him with slippers How dare he stop you on the street and ask about Aashti! Don't worry, it won’t happen again. I’ll go,   and I’ll also talk to Masood, how dare he do like this! Why would he stop you on the street? Why would he ask about Aashti? Umeeda! Yes mom. Come quickly. What did you say to Nazrul?  My talks, our family matter! He asked me mom. He asked me mom, where's Aashti  so what was I supposed to say to him? That's why I told him.  Alright, you went on the road.  Mom, I didn't tell him on the road, he came home and then asked. You should've told him you don't know.  You tell to always speak the truth and not lie. How would I lie? You called him a scoundrel,  I told him. You're going to speak the truth huh! You will insult me!  now if you spoke about our family  matters outside again, I will cut your tongue, break your leg! Do you get it? Now don't talk.  Speak truth but not with such people, say you don't know. Do you get it? Ok, I'm going now! [Music] In love, people behave like children. What love? I don't love you. Alright listen, all lovers have a song. So we should have a song as well. Example? I've selected a song. Which? Now I will sing you our song! You'll sing an english song. [Music] [Laughter] No you can't dance you! [Sings song] I love you, keep on jogging as well. Come on jog!  Have you gone mad? Did we come here to jog?  Did we come to dance on the road?  You have such a beautiful and pretty wife and you're making her thinner I will disappear. Now, don't dissapear. [ Music] Hello, greetings Madam! Greetings,  let me talk to Abrash or Zarnish. Abrash sir and Zarnish madam have gone for jogging,  you can call them on their phone Both of their cell phones are off,  I just wanted to know when are you guys returning. I don't know about it madam,  when Abrash sir will come I'll make you talk with him. Madam, is mom there with you? Could you let me speak with her? I will talk for two minutes. Ok, hold on. Jamila. I'm coming madam! Yes madam? It's Ashti's call, she wants to talk to you. Hello, how are you Aashti? hows my child? You're happy, aren't you? Amma? How can I be happy? I told you, don't send me here. Mom, All day and night, my heart burns. I cry all night. Mom, how can I tell you, seeing Abrash sir with madam seeing them both together I feel very sad, mom I feel a lot of pain, mom My heart burns Aashti, don't cry Don't talk like this Ok now, my child, you’ve reached a new place, you’re sitting in an airplane,  this is a moment of happiness for you, right? Yes, its fine. The kids are fine aswell, they miss you a lot,  your dad was also asking about you. I will say to madam, Aashti, now I'll switch off the phone, goodbye! Thank you madam. Where were you at night!  If you would've come home last night I would've broken your legs! I was so angry, now my anger has subsided.  Hey mom, why didn't you tell me at night?  I would have found him from anywhere.  You stop your nonsense, or I will break your face! How will you break my face? You humiliate me; people say I’m a bad woman and that I ruined my children!    All because of you! Why did you go to Jamila's house?  Tell me, why did you go there? Mom don't hit him.  Oh, you stay quiet! Mom can hit him wherever she wants.  Hit him, Hit him with this knife!   Mom, make him shut up right now, or I will hit him!   You’ll hit me? Who do you think you are?  Jamila aunt, she lies! I didn’t say anything. You stopped Jamila on the road and asked about Ashti,  didn’t you? Who is she to you? Huh? Speak up! If you go to her again, I will break your legs!   Mom, this is the last time I’m saying it: Aashti will come here.  Within a week, my wedding must happen.  If it doesn’t, I’ll kill myself!  That would actually be good if you killed yourself!  I’m already doing your work, you useless person!    
I won’t die like this. First, I’ll kill you, and then I’ll die.   Are you mad? why you are hitting him?  All the time, it’s constant nagging and yelling!  You filthy pig, I won’t spare you!   Get lost!  Go to your father! If you don’t, I’ll hit you even more right now!  Fine, I’m leaving. I’m going now! But I’m not going  to spare you either, you pig! Wait, I’ll show you! Shameless! And you dare talk back? Aren’t you ashamed  of talking like this to your elder brother? Mom, what did I do? Shut up!  otherwise I'll break your leg as well! Shameless! Aqeela, take the veil! [Music]  Sing a song! Which one? Anyone. [Sings song] [Sings song] I don't know more, lets sing another another song! [Sings song] Another song! [Sings song] [Sings song] [Music] [Sings song] I just remembered, the girl you were asking about, her name was Monica.  Yeah, kind of a cheap name, just leave it, man. Anyway, the guy’s name was  Jhon. What? Jhon! Do you get it? Come on, go! [Laughter] You won't get dirty, come on, sit down! By the way, Sherry, I must admire your courage for getting along so well with women like Mrs. Kirmani and Mrs. Javed.  It takes effort, my dear, it really does! You see,  they are members of the organizing committee of my NGO. And whenever the funding committee comes over,  I absolutely have to invite them. Because if they say anything against me, consider my funding cut off! By the way, how do you manage all this? Yes, it is not that easy to manage all this,  do workshops, seminars, gather women and then have long discussions in front of those women. What do you think? Do they understand the long speeches  or does it awaken some courage in them that they should make their own destiny? What kind of topics have you started talking about? and tell me what is happening in the world.  Hafeez said to me that like Sherry, you should also  you should also open an NGO and you know Sherry,  I have no knowledge about it. And Hafeez was saying that Sherry is your friend, ask her, that's why I am asking you, so tell me one thing,  does one benefit from it themselves as well or  the money comes and goes, then why should one get this headache?  Shouldn't I start another business! Now, haven't you spoken your heart out?  Your husband is absolutely right that there is money and fame in this. Sherry you just tell me one thing right now,  how do you make money in this? I will tell you, I will tell you everything. First get me some tea! Okay, I'll it for you. Zarnish, you know, all the days I’ve spent here  with you, near you,  I feel like I’ll never be able to forget them for the rest of my life. My heart wishes these days would never end and that we'd always stay here, in this guest house,  amidst these mountains  just you and me, with no one else around.  That you wouldn’t leave, and I wouldn’t leave either. But Zarnish, we can’t spend our whole lives here. You know, dreams are very different from reality.  The dream is that we stay here forever, but the reality is that we’ll have to leave this place behind. Hello? Yes papa, how are you? I am absolutely fine and so is Zarnish. Tell him that I will meet him the day after tomorrow,  yes I will come tomorrow. Send someone to the airport at 6 o'clock,  the flight's at 4 o'clock from here. there is a flight from here at 4:00 o'clock,  okay, yes, I will come, definitely!  Ok, see you tomorrow, bye!  Why didn't you tell me that we're going tomorrow? You knew that we were going to stay here for 10 days. Yes, but you should've asked me before confirming the seat! I will not go now! Ok then don't go, stay here Alone? Not alone, you can keep Aashti with you.  Aashti? that maid! Maybe you have a good understanding with the servants, but I don’t. Tell Papa that we will come next week.  This cannot happen Zarnish, I have started a furniture business, I have to export it and much more work,  Papa cannot handle all this. Then don't handle it, you can handle it next week.  Zarnish we've roamed around a lot! There are thousands of tasks which are pending,  we will come again. It's not about coming again! It is a matter of mood, some other time I can come alone aswell. I am surprised how big claims you make of your love  and then can't even agree to a small thing for me! Love doesn't mean that we should leave the whole world and sit in this wilderness. Wilderness? a while ago, you found this wilderness  very beautiful. It's beautiful even now Zarnish. You just have to understand,  we will suffer a lot, why don't you understand, we have to go! Why do I have to understand each time?
