I also do household work. Don't talk about yourself mother, you are grown up. A girl who works in home is not good. People consider them bad. Aqeela's boss gives her many gifts, did he give charity in the name of Allah? Clothes, Jewelry and many more, he gives for free? She say, he took a photo, Am I crazy? Am I shameless? I don't understand these things. Hey, you are a fool  All women here work like this.  Boss pays the right of our hard work, gives us clothes and jewelry. Jamila also gets, Aashti too, what is wrong in this, everyone gives.  I don't want this type of bride. I can't live with her. I divorce Aqeela. Shameless, you will divorce her? Mother ... Aqeela ...

Nothing will happen. Sit down. You stay at Jamila's house. Mother, take me along with you, don't leave me here. He has gone mad, first we will talk to him. First, we will straighten him out, and then we'll take you home. I have called Meezan Baba, he will put his mind right, you don't have to worry, Jamila, take care of Aqeela. What are you talking about? Aqeela is like my daughters. Now don't cry, I am leaving. I haven't done anything. Why are you asking me, ask her what happened? She used to work in the house.  She says, Boss give her money, Boss gives her clothes. I have already told mother; I don't want a maid. Everyone works, Boss gives to everyone, my wife also works. You have no shame Nazrul. I will hit you hard, talking nonsense. You don't want her to work, keep her at home. You can't divorce her. You married for four days? Come on, let's go home. I won't go. Get lost from here. My brother, listen to me. Allah gave you a beautiful wife. She is so beautiful like a fairy. You will divorce her? Now I will not go with you Nazrul. I will not go with you, I will go alone. Listen to me. Do not follow me Nazrul. I you will go home; you will not come home. He is shameless.
