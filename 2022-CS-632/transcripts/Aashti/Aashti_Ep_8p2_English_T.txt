[88.29] Maybe not life with you, but
[90.56] I also get some moments,
[93.21]  but then why does this greed come in my heart, I wish this
[97.76] moment becomes better, if not the century, 
[100.48] then at least it becomes as long as my life
[112.11] [Music]
[148.84] Aashti, today for the first time I felt 
[151.99] how much I love you, my child.
[155.85] Mom, I also went away from home for the first time.
[161.29] Umeda, how are you?
[165.86] I am good? And how are you? I am fine. You? I am fine too.
[174.14] Sister Aashti, can I say something? 
[176.97] You've gotten fairer than before. Really? Am I fair?
[181.00] Umeda is saying the truth; your complexion has gotten better.
[184.81]  Mom, the weather there was very nice,
[190.12] Absolutely cold! Sister Aashti, didn't you feel scared in the airplane? 
[194.62] No Umeda, I didn't feel scared.
[197.21] Because I had tied the seat belt. 
[200.73] Sister Aashti, you didn't bring anything for me.
[203.41] Umeda, I didn't go anywhere alone. If they take me only then I go.
[210.36] I used to work their, they used to roam around.
[217.42] There was only work in my destiny.
[222.90] Mom, I am tired, I'll go and rest.
[244.46] [Music]
[291.62] Aashti, I know everything, how difficult it must have been for you.
[299.76] I know my child.
[305.92] Mom, it was very difficult, very difficult. 
[317.39] Mom, I felt as if there was no heart in my chest; only glass.
[327.63] That used to break everytime.
[332.39] What should I do with my heart, mom? What should I do?
[339.61] I was very scared Aashti,
[342.61] that they don't come to know your feelings.
[347.74] I was very scared, very scared Aashti.
[358.07] [Music]
[389.66] What happened to you Zarnish?
[391.11]  We have spent so many good days over there and you
[395.13] have spoiled our mood here. What has happened to you.
[397.01]  I don't like it, get fine!
[400.32] I didn't like it either, you swear such big oaths of love
[403.92] yet you can't even fulfill one small wish of mine.
[406.46] What did I ask? Just one more week in the mountain, that's it.
[412.37] Look, there was a problem, of my work, my business problem
[417.08] I have set up a new business, if it was the old one 
[419.70] which was already set up, then there would've been 
[420.71] no problem. Today we've come back after so many days but still today
[426.00] I've taken you out so 
[428.71] that our family does not have any misunderstanding about us.
[431.12] So that they don't misunderstand anything.
[435.11] Please, I want you to laugh, talk to me, please don't do this with me.
[440.64] I want you to keep laughing whenever I come into the house.
[443.79] Look at me with a smiley face so that whatever
[445.80] tiredness I have, goes away. Please laugh, get fine please.
[450.56] Forgive me, we'll go again, look how far Murree is, Murree, up north, 
[455.68] we can go anywhere, any time! I know we'll go after 6 months.
[460.36] I know it! No, no very soon, 
[463.40] within a few days my load will be reduced, promise!
[466.40] Trust. we both will go, very soon. Now laugh one time, laugh.
[473.12] Not like this, the other one, more!
[478.99] Let's go somewhere, let's eat something.
[481.01] You want to drink juice, ok come on, let's go.
[496.20] Take out your phone!
[498.00] One second, no rudeness!
[508.85] Come on.
[518.37] Hey, who is it? Who has come? What happened?
[524.12] What have I done? Hey, Nazrul!
[530.12] What happened? What are you doing? What did I do?
[535.78] Why are you fighting at this time? What did I do?
[540.40] Where are you taking him? Hey, listen to me! hey Nazrul!
[564.17] I didn't do anything. Unnecessarily, I was framed; I am innocent. 
[567.98] So the police arrested you for no reason?
[571.00]  How do I know, the police arrests everyone! 
[574.69] Is the police mad? Why didn't they arrest me then?
[576.70] Hey, get lost! What kind of nonsense are you talking, 
[580.23] what will someone say if they hear it?
[581.24] that people of my locality are saying that I've done something,
[584.70]  then they will think that I've
[585.72] done something, you're a weird guy! 
[588.20] Hey, what noise are you making? Sir, I swear on God
[592.20] I have not done anything, why did you lock me. 
[596.31] Yes, you are an angel, we locked you for no reason
[599.42] Don't make much noise, this is a police station,
[602.96] not your aunt's house, understood? 
[605.18] Sir, tell me what has he done?
[608.20] What's your problem? Why are you asking again and again? 
[610.38] Hey, slow down! Malik, come here,
open him, take him to SHO sir.
[616.90] That boy smuggles humans.
[619.92] It is not a minor crime. 
[621.63] Do you know how big is the punishment for human smuggling?
[625.30] Sir, it's a lie, he can't do this, 
[629.57] where would he send, if he would've sent someone
[634.56] then wouldn't he had gone himself? So then am I lying?
[638.60] He doesn't mean that you're lying. 
[641.34] Maybe you have a misunderstanding.
[644.36] We are sitting on this chair. There is no scope for any misunderstanding. 
[649.35] Every work is done with research,
[651.37] otherwise, there would be no chair, no uniform; this is our living.
[656.50] Even then, if you donâ€™t believe me, I can convince you, Saqi. Yes sir?
[662.24] Go and bring two of those people 
[664.69] whom their son was sending to Europe.
[669.34] By the way, what does your son do? 
[672.53] Right now, he does not do any work, sometimes he
[677.52] catches fish with me. 
[681.24] So, what do you give him, I mean how much salary do you pay him?
[686.54] What's the talk about a salary? It's my own business, why would I pay him?
[693.72] We recovered Rs 8000 from him.
[696.68] From where did he get such a huge amount from?
[699.16] Say it! Tell them where the money came from! 
[704.50] Yes, where were you guys going? Sir, we were going to Europe.
[711.82] Who was sending you? 
[713.16] Sir, a man named Anwar-ul-Haq was sending us to Europe.
[718.03] but we gave the money to Nazrul Islam. 
[722.31] How much did you pay him?
[726.38] We gave 1 lakh, person sir.
[731.20] Did you hear it gentlemen? Take them 
[736.03] and take him as well. Come on.
[744.24] Yes, gentlemen what do you say now?
[746.39] I feel like Anwar-ul-Haq was smuggling humans.
[751.43] The boy was only fooled by him.
[753.80]  Sir, the one who knows the ways of earning money like this
[757.80] is not a fool. Tell me, has Anwar-ul-Haq been caught?
[763.44] No, he has run away, we will catch him. 
[767.61] Where will he go? We'll catch him soon.
[770.44] But let me tell you one thing, gentlemen this is not a small matter,
[774.14] we have not filed an FIR till now. Now I fill file the FIR
[779.18] If you haven't filed, the FIR yet then how did you arrest him?
[783.85] Gentlemen, now you don't teach me law
[786.86] what is there in the FIR, it will be filed just now. You all go outisde.
[804.54] Nazrul doesn't do works like this. Anwar-ul-haq trapped him
[812.30] Now God willingly, may Nazrul get released.
[815.21] When he goes home then I'll fix his mind!
[822.65] I will fix his mind, now I don't know
[828.20] whether they will leave him or not. 
[831.42] Masood brother, God willingly he'll get released, don't worry.
[835.45] The sir's a very important person, he has higher connections. 
[841.64] Now if he gets released, I will lock up Nazrul in the house!
[848.25] Not let him go out of the house, thats why I used to say to Nurul Amin
[855.13] If the wedding happens soon, all these troubles will come to an end.
[860.75]  Yes, Masood bhai,
[862.76] as soon as he gets out, start preparations for the wedding. 
[866.55] Look, Masood,
[869.56] Nurul Amin is absolutely right, 
[872.39] take him from here and first of all get him married,
[875.40] he'll live with his wife, everything will be fine
[878.07] Right now, there's no need for him to go out of the house.
[881.80] He'll sit with friends, he will get ruined!
[884.93] Daughter in law will come, everything will be fine. 
[887.27] Understood? Alright? Yes.
[891.42] I can't understand what to do. Zamani, stop crying. 
[897.26] Theres no use of crying now, pray that there's no case on him.
[902.40] Otherwise, it will be difficult for him to be released.
[905.25]  Yes, Zamani mother, aunt is right
[908.26] Don't worry, just pray that Nazrul brother gets released soon.
[913.94] I can't understand, Nazrul hasn't done anything wrong, 
[918.29] now I don't know what has happened to him!
[920.30] He's, my enemy; enemy! 
[922.10] Hey Saeed, Where's Nazrul? It seems difficult for him to be released.
[929.05] What nonsense are you saying! What did my Nazrul did? 
[932.50] He is a broker of sending people,
[934.52] here people can't stay in Pakistan,
[936.01] and he is tricking people into sending them to Europe
