Sir, you have caused yourself a lot of trouble by coming here. Come in. Come, come. Greeting, Abrash sir. Greetings! what am I hearing Aashti? After studying for the whole year, you won't give the exam? Wouldn't all your hard work go to waste? How much loss is this? That's ok, my benefit is nowhere.  Madam is correct,  what will we maids get after getting educated? Isnâ€™t it just sweeping, mopping, and cooking?  What are you talking about? In one day all your views have changed,  all your thinking has changed. Life changes in one breath.  Come on Aashti, stop it now,  Abrash sir is absolutely right. He has spent so much money on your education  and now when it's time to give your exam you are not giving the exam.  It's going to be such a loss of money for Abrash sir. It's not about the money, Jamila.  It's about her future, her passion. Now, neither the future remains nor the passion.  You had promised me that you will do graduation,  now there is no need to talk about this nonsense,  you will fulfill your promise and give the exam,  do you understand? Now you don't have to say anything, be quiet. Did you go the doctor? Nurul Amin brought the medicines. How can you take medicine without showing it to a doctor.  Come on, I will take you to the doctor, Come on, let's go. No Abrash sir, I will get fine. You cannot get better without seeing a doctor  and you have to get well because my mehndi is on Saturday, wedding on Sunday,  if you don't come, it won't be nice. Then what will happen? I won't get married. No Abrash sir, Aashti will definitely come to your wedding. You don't feel like seeing me becoming a groom?   I will come. I have a great desire to see you become groom. So at least come to fulfill your desire. Come on,  now I will take you to the doctor, come on. I am sitting outside, you get ready, ok. [Bangla Song] How is it? It's very beautiful Where did you get money from?  When I asked you for money day before yesterday,  you said you don't have money.  Now you have money for wife's saree.  Day before yesterday I had no money. Today, I got a job, I also got advance.  Now you have realized value of wife Now live happily with your wife.  You can get sorrow without asking  but happiness cannot be received without asking. Do you understand? Mother,  now quickly arrange for Nazrul brother's marriage as well Sister Aashti will come here, then our hearts will be at ease.  He also has a twisted mind, I will have to force him too, then he will agree. The colors very nice. What are you indicating about? Who did it? You're lying!

After climbing the mountain, the throat gets dry  so the toffee will come in handy Do you get it? Yes, I understand. No one's relative will come here to drop them off  and come on time.
