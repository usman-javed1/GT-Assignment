[Music]  Even when I don't talk to you, you feel as if I have said something?  I feel like when we silently look at each other,  it’s as if we are making a promise of love to each other. All I know is that I’ve never loved  anyone as much as I love you.  I really enjoy being with you—going out,   spending time together, laughing, and making you laugh. Life was never as beautiful as it seems today.  See that mountain over there? I want to climb its highest peak with you  and look at the world from there Lets go [Applause] You people saw this movie, do you like it? Very good! Alright, now we’ll talk a little about this movie. What did you see in this movie?  Women were being beaten, and they were running away.  All the women were running in burqas.  People were beating women with sticks.  So, tell me, what does this mean? It means that women don’t have the freedom to speak.  Oppressing women, beating them, abusing them,  not listening to what they have to say. Now, tell me, how many of you have experienced such oppression? No, this can’t happen in our village.  We respect women a lot. Okay, then tell me,  how are the women who work in other people’s homes treated? They do get paid, but are they given respect? That doesn’t happen at all. Even our utensils are kept separate,  even though we’re all Muslims.  then why do they do like this? Ask these women, the maid who works in my house,  I got her educated and now she goes to college  and is just like a member of our family Clap! [Applause] You know, I always used to wonder  what the word 'honeymoon' actually means. And I always thought that going to the moon  is called a honeymoon. You were so cute! I was only five years old.  I also know that the word 'honeymoon' was first used where?  Do you know when? In Northern Europe in 1952, no 1552. Really? I always thought it was a new word  from the 18th or 20th century. And back then, couples in Europe  used to be given honey wine for a year.   So, where's my honey wine? I, myself! But that's a lot of information about honeymoon. I thought I was going on a honeymoon,  so I should know what it is You know, Abrash, these are the best days of my life. And I want these best days to become  even more beautiful and memorable. How? By not ruining the mood over petty issues  and loving unconditionally all the time You know there is nothing else between lovers. There is only love, I want you to keep on smiling like this. Keep loving me all the time, always. I love you. [Music] Come one! This is the 3rd round, I can't do it anymore It's good, when you'll reach Karachi, you'll be slim.  I don't want to be any slimer than this! You go jogging, I’m going. Where? Home! Come on, let’s run together. Okay, I’ll run with you. I’ll jog, and you’ll drive the car, alright? Actually, I got an idea. I’ll read a poem,  about your beauty, about your hair! Can you recite a poem about my hair?  Yes, yes, come on, let’s try this today. Okay, going alone on a long road feels so blissful.  I'll tell you what 'blissful' means later.  Walking alone on a long road is blissful. Thousands of wishes...  walking alone on a long road feels so blissful. Come on, your jeep is slow, I’m fast, but not that much. Thousands of butterflies fly with us on a long road.  Walking alone on a long road feels so blissful. And your hair is so curly,  I don't even know what poem am I reading! Now you’ve gotten faster, but I’m still running with you.  Go on, run faster. Walking alone on a long road is  so blissful but walking alone on a long road. Oh God! A minibus is coming from the front.  Are you crazy? Ok, walking alone on a long  road is so blissful, thousands of memories  run with us, walk with us. Walking alone on a long road feels so blissful. You go alone; I’m going now. No matter how depressing it is, I’m still enjoying reciting it Hey! I was joking  [Music] Umeeda, I am going to the banglow for the work.  Close the door and take care of the kids. Greetings brother Nazrul! Greetings! Where's aunt Jamila? She left for work  and will go to Shabnum's house from there. Okay. Yes, brother Nazrul is here! What did you do to your head?  You keep doing whatever's in your heart. Go bring me a glass of cold drink. Juice is finished,  but I can get you cold water, I just bought ice. No, I won’t drink water, but you guys do one thing; catch this!  Well done! Now you catch it too! What did you bring?  What are you giving?  Oh, I brought a toffee, you’re going to eat it too, now catch it! Oh, you didn’t catch it, that’s why you can’t become a cricketer. Okay, come here, catch this. Go, give it to your friends too. Umeeda, sit here near brother, here, I brought this for you. Now just tell me, when will Aashti come? Sister Aashti will come after 10 days.  It’s been so many days since she left but still, she’ll come after 10 days.  I don’t know. Boss will give sister Aashti Rs. 3000  that’s why mom sent her to Murree. I had a suspicion from the beginning  that Aunt Jamila did all this out of greed for money. I told Aunt Jamila;  you didn’t do the right thing to me. I know, mother complained to father about you,  she said, Nazrul Islam is not a good boy,  he’s a loafer, a complete loafer, and I won’t marry Aashti to him! Did she say that? Yes. And what else did she say? She said that your mother has ruined your father’s mind. A good woman would never spoil her children like that. What! did she say that about my mother? Now I’ll tell you whose woman is good and whose isn’t!  Give this back to me! Where are the kids! [Singing song] [Singing song] [Singing song] Drive slowly! Are you feeling scared?  Yes, because you're driving! With love, slowly and gently.  You are driving a jeep better than me!  I know right, should I drive faster? No, that's it. Should I driver faster? No! First say you love me, I love you. Louder ... I love you! Louder, I love You [Singing Song] You have no idea; how beautiful you are looking! Let me apply this. Now Farooq will see you, he will fall in love and will say I want to marry this girl only. I have done all the work, I have prepared the juice,  When is your son-in-law coming?  Farooq said he will come till 4. He will come with his friend and brother-in-law.  Mother I am feeling nervous Don't know what Farooq will ask?  Don't know what he will say and do?  Not much, you know what people do  when they go to buy a sacrificial goat? They open the goat's mouth and count  its teeth then make it walk, that's it! He will also open your mouth and counts your teeth,  then he will check your walk. No mother, I won't open mouth, why will he check teeth?  Why are you scaring her Jamila? She is joking, he will ask you questions just answer him. He will ask you simple questions, he will ask what do you like and what you don't like?  Which song do you like? Who is your favorite hero, that's it!  Shall I tell you an interesting thing. When I was getting married,  Nurul Amin came to see me and asked me to dance, I said no, I will not dance,  Nurul Amin went out of the room and said to my mother that your daughter has very bad manners.  I said, I have bad manners?  Fine, go ahead. I won’t marry you Jamila Aunty, shall I also say like this?  Hey, she is joking. Hey Jamila,  why are you messing with her mind? You will answer correctly. When marriage happens, the boy sees  how the girl speaks, how she walks, how she talks, you just answer correctly and whatever he says, just obey him [Music] [Music] You are carrying the luggage?  Why have you brought her with you? How will she carry so much luggage alone? Abrash, it's her job. Abrash ... Okay, I am giving her. Come down. Is it hurting? I should take you to the doctor. Come on, try to get up. It's hurting.
