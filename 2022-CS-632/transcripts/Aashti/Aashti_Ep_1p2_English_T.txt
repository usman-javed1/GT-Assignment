[1.52] Mother, you don't feel insulted, but I do. Have you gone mad? She always says such things.
[9.04] If Sir and Mr. Abrash werenâ€™t here, I would never have worked here neither let you do it.
[16.52] Keep quiet, if madam heard you, she would kick us out, then what will we do?
[23.12] From where you will eat? How will you study? Leave this, I will do it myself, you start cleaning.
[31.60] You will never stop favoring these penniless people. Hey Sherry, no man is poor or rich,
[38.08] They have been employee of ours for 10 years, they are trustworthy
[44.08] you will get more employees, but you can't trust someone and
[48.60] leave house on them. When these people came here 10 years ago,
[52.52] there was no trust on them too. You gain trust with the time. Such honest women
[58.00] are rarely found, they are trustworthy. You read everyday incidents in newspapers.
[67.44] Sherry, I am not saying that you should not scold, but not in such a way
[74.56] that a person starts feeling insulted.
[117.52] Aashti ... Hey Aashti ...
[122.28]  I am coming mother after cleaning sir's room,
[142.92] What are you doing? I have come to clean your room. Okay!
[150.92] You must wear this saree. Why don't you wear saree?
[155.84] You know I like those Bengali women who wear sarees and they
[159.52] tie a knot in their hair and put a flower in the knot, like ....
[166.84] Like the film actress Shabnum? Absolutely! I like very much
[173.76] the women who wear saree. Do you know what is called the magic of Bengal? These
[178.96] Bengali women have deep eyes, long hair, saree, just wear saree, you
[184.32] will look very good. Yes sir, now I will wear it, I also like it. I
[193.32] wanted to clean your room. Yes, please do. Tell me how your studies are going? My studies is going
[198.76] very good. You did not go to college today? I did not go to college today because mother
[207.08] had to work, she was tired, so she ask me to help her. Very bad, very bad, you know
[213.28] you should not leave college, you should never waste your studies time, I don't
[217.96] like you working like this, you have to become something else, do something else. 
[222.12] Okay, go do your work. Where is Baba? He is in his room.
[230.68] Okay ... go!
[252.93] [Music]
[277.76] I don't like you working like this, you have to become something else,
[281.44] do something else, but I love doing your work. 
[291.30] [Music]
[318.92] I did not know that you would be so beautiful, I used to think before marriage that whom I
[326.64] would have a marriage will be like? Zamani mother told me
[332.16] that you are very beautiful, just like a fairy. I did not believe it at first.
[340.36] You know what I did? What you did? I brought the whitening cream and
[350.20] applied it for 15 days and now everyone says to me, I have become fair, have I become fair Aqeela?
[359.92] Yes, you are fair even if you are black, I still like you. I also like you.
[369.72] Shall I say something Aqeela?
[375.32] I don't like that any other man should look at you or even talk to you,
[383.36] What are you saying? Aqeela, you don't know, everyone is not nice, they look at us with bad intentions,
[395.40] I just feel that you are only mine, I love you very much. Saeed, 
[404.76] I used to think about the person with whom I am getting married how he will be?
[412.56] we will be. How did you find me Aqeela? I like you! Really?
[421.88] Zamani mother was not in favor of my wedding. She said first Nazrul would get married. Then why
[429.36] didn't it happen? Nazarul's wife is still studying. Aqeela ...
[435.60] you did not study? No, my mother did not
[442.80] let me study. Who will spend money? Both I and mother used to work. 
[449.84] Did you work? Yes. What work did you do? In different people houses.
[458.88] Mother had three houses, I used to work in only one house, My boss
[465.88] was very nice. Boss is not nice Aqeela. No, he was very nice and he gave me a lot of
[474.52] stuff, this Sari was also given to me by them. You are beautiful, that's why they gave it to you.
[480.68] No, he gives it to me because it was my marriage. They
[487.48] took great care of me. Once I fell ill, they
[492.76] took me to a big hospital. They showed me to the doctor there. They also gave us three days leave.
[497.84] They also gave me five dresses. They gave me a lot of clothes; I will you show you. I don't want to look at your clothes.
[502.56] Hey Asraful, start your motor, take us there, we will not go further there. Saeed, you
[508.68] told me that you will show me the wooden bridge? I am not well, we
[513.60] will go back home, let's go quickly. She has spoiled my whole mode.
[519.72] Your boat is not working? Saeed ... Enough!
[526.92] Just move around, let's go there.
[535.29] [Music]
[555.44] Nazrul brother, a studio photo would be nicer. The police would
[560.68] have caught and hit too. It wouldn't be nicer. 
[566.64] Here police catch you. Now go, your work is done. 
[572.24] How many days will it take for ID card to be ready?
[576.52] I can't say anything, money does every work quickly.
[584.32] I will come in evening and will take Rs.5000 from all three of you. Brother, it's too much.
[592.64] It is not an easy task. Government is involved in it. It's not easy to dodge government.
[603.88] Why shall we pay you when we haven't not signed any form? You know everything. Now you People
[613.04] will also remember, take this ID card form, fill it up, sign on it,
[620.76] put your thumb print too. I will take this in evening too. Please make it quick. I will try my best to make it quick
[629.08] but now listen to me,

[642.08] It will be done, don't worry. Just don't go out of this room. I will come in evening; Rs.5000
[653.16] Don't go out. Close the door from inside, no one should open it, don't
[660.24] open it at all, only on my voice open it.

[706.00] saree, my boss gave me. Look!
[712.16] What else he gave to you? He gave me these bangles and also
[720.52] gave me earrings.
[725.28] How good it is? Boss said to me, 'Aqeela, this looks good on you, wear it, I wore it and
[734.20] you know, what he did? He took my photo; shall I show it to you? 
[741.80] They gave you earrings, they also gave bangles, clothes, why did they give all this?
[750.24] I said, he used to take care of me a lot What else did he give?
[757.48] No one does anything like this without reason and why did you bring all this?
[764.08] You will not wear all this. I can sense something fishy here. But why? 
[772.36] I like this all. I said you will not wear all this, if you wear, I will set fire on it.
