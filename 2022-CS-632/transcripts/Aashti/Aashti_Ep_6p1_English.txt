Pipi (Aunty) , I hope it's not too crowded and it should be of a certain standard too. Don't worry, it's a fully furnished guest house. It's also very beautiful, you will not have any problem there. But there might be one problem.  You guys will drink coffee, tea, clothes will have to be ironed. So, you guys would have to do that work yourself.  No aunty, it's our honeymoon, I can't do all this work.  Why don't we stay in a hotel?  No Zarnish, I can't stay in a hotel please. why don't we ask her? Not a bad idea. It's difficult that she will agree. Aunty, we will pay her, why won't she agree?  You guys leave it, I will ask her Aashti, come here. Yes sir. Me and Zarnish are going to Murree,  so you come with us. The weather there is amazing. You will have fun there,  even the clouds come into the room. Father will not allow me.  We will pay you, is 2k or 4k rupees bad? Don't worry about your father, I will say to Jamila,  she will talk to your father. But how will I go? We will go by plane,  Tomorrow's morning flight to Islamabad,  then from there to Murree. [Music] Oh my god, this is so much fun! right Abrash? Yes. I am so glad, we came here.  I have seen Europe, I've seen America.  I've seen Australia, I just had to see Pakistan, and I love it. Your hairs are very nice, you can keep them open. Abrash, you know how my hair are like.  In these mountains, no one will say anything about your hair. No one will see your beautiful hair.  Don't you want me to look beautiful? You are looking good, even right now.  You will look even better if you keep your hair open. Aashti how are you feeling? Are you enjoying or not?  Aashti is happy.  Yes, enjoy, you will not get a chance again [Music] God! How are you feeling?  I had no idea Pakistan would be so beautiful. But the true beauty of this place is that you are with me. We both are together.  I am so glad we live in Pakistan.  If there were two or three more like you here,  how much fun it would be.  You really ruin the whole mood Come on, your mood isn't ruined at all. [Music] Saaed, why are you staring at me like that?  I am feeling shy. Hey, if I don't look, then who will? I never said don't look at me,  but at least say something. Today, I will say nothing.  Today I will only look at you and listen to you. What will I say?  Saeed, why don't you go fishing with father? Nazrul brother also doesn't go either.  Aqeela, I don't like the job of catching fish in the sea. You still go to the factory; you don't like your work? If I tell you the truth, Aqeela, you won't laugh, will you? Why would I laugh? When I was very small, once father took me with him to catch fish in the sea That night there was such a dangerous storm, we managed to escape from there with great difficulty.  After that, I swore that  I would never go to the sea with father again. I feel very scared at night Aqeela.  Saeed, I feel scared too. Do you know, Nazrul, that shameless person, when I was small,  he used to tell me that he's not my elder brother,  he's a ghost. He used to scare me. And you used to get scared? I was a kid, my heart was also small that time  but now I am not scared of him. I have caused great harm to Nazrul after growing up. What harm did you cause to Nazrul, brother? I picked up his 2-4 shirts,  2-4 shoes, and threw them in the sea and I also sold his 2-4 pigeons!  And Nazrul brother said nothing to you?  He would have said something if he found out. After that, I released a cat in his pigeon cage and by the time he got to know,  2-4 of the pigeons got eaten by the cat.  Saeed, you didn't do the right thing. Pigeons are innocent bird, and you killed them,  Allah will be angry with you.  Nazrul can do whatever he wants,  and I can't even take revenge.  Look, Aqeela, don't defend Nazrul in front of me,  I don't like it. Now, get up! Let's go home.  Always defending him, now go in front! Who will wear the veil, Aqeela?  There are so many people standing, come on! Look, men are coming from front,  that's why I told you to take the veil. Aashti Yes? What happened, are you okay?  I don't know, what's happening in my ear, I am hearing strange sounds.  I told you if there's any problem, you should tell me.  I was fine after getting off the plane I don't know what happened to me over here. Look, actually we are at a high altitude,  air pressure here is less. That is why you are feeling like this right now,  after some time, you will get used to it. You will be fine, enjoy yourself here!  Look at what an amazing place you've come Who knows if you'll get this opportunity again or not.  I might never have been able to come here in my life. because of you, I got to see such a beautiful scenery.  Alright then, good, you liked it right?  I liked it very much.  Now you have to do one work for me.  What is that?  Bring good grades in exam. Absolutely. Good. Let's go, I am ready. [Music] [Music] Have you gone crazy?  Why did you send Aashti?  Nurul Amin, stop blabbering now. I sent her after asking you  then why are you constantly asking,  why did you send her? Abrash's wife said, she will give Rs 3000 for 10 days,  we still have to repay the loan. You don't care. You always do whatever you want Aashti is my kid too, not just yours.  Greetings aunt Jamila! Greetings!  Uncle how are you? I am good. No, you are not looking fine Jamila, don't you feed your man,  he's gotten so skinny. At this point, he eats my brain as well, how will I make him fat?  Jamila, do you even have a brain in your head?  What will I even eat? Brother Noor. Jamila, I am going to meet Meezan Baba. Okay! Sit How are you, Razia, came after a long time. I came three times, you weren't here,  you go in the morning and come at night,  why do you do so much work?  When do I come back in the night?  I come back in the evening. There was Sir's son's wedding going on   because of which I would get late. Now you tell me,  when are you getting Shabnam married?  Aunt Jamila, it is because of this reason  we came to get Aashti.  Be quiet, Jamila the proposal has been finalized,  but the date has not been set. Now the boy says,  he will see Shabnam. Shabnam is shy  She says that if Aashti will be with her,  then she will go in front of the boy. Aashti is not here,  she has gone to Murree to see the snow.  She went to Murree? Yes! in the plane She was scared and saying that she wouldn't  sit in the plane it would fall. The plane doesn't fall, I have sat in it and seen.  Then, Sir and his family were making fun of her.  They travel by airplane a lot.  Aunt Jamila, if I tell you one thing  about mother you will laugh. When we were going to Bangladesh,  we had to sit in the airplane for the first time. When we were about to board the plane,  the other plane took off,  as soon as mother saw, she ran down the stairs  and said, 'I will not go,  this airplane will fly and then fall down'. Oh Razia! Now how would I know?  I said, it's such a big piece of iron, it will fall.  Now will you drink tea?  Yes, I will drink. Why did Aashti go to Murree?  Abrash sir and his wife took Aashti;  there's a lot of work there.  Jamila, this is very bad,  now her engagement is about to happen when will Aashti be back?  She will come back within 10 days.  She will come back before her engagement.  I will bring the tea. Why are you making fun of me  regarding the plane thing? [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
