[19.37] - Thank you so much for everything, Mom.
- Thank you for what?
[23.07] I think it was my misunderstanding
that I was unable to understand you.
[33.23] I want all the details.
[35.01] I want to know what all he has left
and where he's applying for jobs.
[39.88] You're taking me lightly, right?
[42.04] I've already gathered all the details.
[44.96] And I've made a list, as well.
[48.36] This is the list all the multinational
companies he's applied to.
[55.30] I have my informants
in most of these countries.
[59.75] And where there are none,
it doesn't take long to place some there.
[67.26] He has an experience of 25 years.
That's not an ordinary thing.
[71.03] He can easily get a good job
anywhere.
[74.13] It's a mistake to think like that.
[75.57] I've made an entire strategy.
[78.24] Forget finding a job,
[79.91] he won't be able to show his face anywhere
in the city.
[83.07] I'll badmouth him so much in the city.
[87.98] Why do you worry? I'm here.
[92.56] I just... asked you for something.
[112.41] Come in, Bhai. Your bride is fully ready.
[116.04] Now you go and get ready as well.
Baba said you have to receive the guests.
[124.77] Bhai!
[126.43] I'm saying something to you.
[128.12] Yes, I'm listening.
What... what do I have to do?
[132.32] You're looking at Bhabi
as if you've seen her for the first time.
[136.89] Actually, this is the magic of makeup
and the dress,
[140.08] otherwise you know your bhabi.
[142.04] Don't you dare say anything
about my bhabi.
[144.44] My bhabi is the most beautiful. And
you're lucky to have such a beautiful wife.
[148.55] Yeah, that I'll figure out later,
[150.71] for now, you go so I can get ready.
You can sing your bhabi's praises later.
[154.56] Okay, I'll go. I'll go.
[156.25] I know you want privacy
and I'm bothering you.
[159.16] - You! You! Wrong thing you're saying.
- Okay, bye! Sorry!
[164.10] That's not fair!
[175.11] - You look nice today.
- Thank you.
[178.51] - And I'm also very happy.
- Why?
[182.09] Because...
[184.51] I've found you.
[290.77] Salam! Come, come.
[293.16] - Salam!
- You guys got so late.
[296.13] I've been waiting since so long.
Everybody's waiting for you.
[298.61] Rameen is also waiting.
Where were you?
[301.09] We were going to come at 7 pm,
but...
[304.88] They didn't send the car to you
with the driver?
[307.25] Shahzar said...
[308.52] I told Rameen to send the car to you,
get you picked.
[312.37] Rameen, I swear. She must've forgotten.
She wouldn't have remembered.
[315.01] They're busy in their own things.
[316.61] I'm so sorry you didn't get the car
and you had to come in a taxi.
[321.14] It's nothing like that.
We came very easily in a taxi.
[324.23] Yes, absolutely.
[324.80] Oh, Auntie, you must've travelled
in wagons and taxis.
[329.38] But this would be the first time
for Mehr-un-Nisa, no?
[331.48] She must've been inconvenienced.
[334.00] It's very wrong.
You could've just called me.
[336.76] I would've checked.
[339.25] You're treating us like strangers.
It's very wrong.
[342.40] I'll scold them why they didn't the car.
Come in, please.
[345.36] Come in. Please, please come.
[428.73] You didn't make us meet your in-laws.
[431.47] We've heard that you arranged for your
son to marry into a middle-class family.
[439.81] They belong to a good family, they're
just going through a business crisis.
[446.55] They nice, well-respected people.
[447.80] But some people are raising fingers
at Mr. Umar's reputation.
[453.00] And I've heard from someone
[456.75] that he committed fraud worth billions
with his business partners.
[462.91] His company went bankrupt.
[465.64] They went from being on the sky
to being on the ground.
[467.74] I've heard some really weird things.
[472.16] That he spent his money on women,
went bankrupt himself.
[477.85] In fact, he ruined his wife's business too.
[483.77] And this thing has spread like wildfire
in the advertising sector.
[490.62] You made a very hasty decision.
[492.96] Of marrying your son to such a man
of such ill reputation.
[498.39] I mean, Shahzar received proposals
from girls from all the prominent families.
[505.04] You were very rushed.
[665.08] Yes, hello!
[667.00] Where are you?
[669.32] Yes, the dinner is going on, and people are
arriving. Everything is fine, come quickly.
[676.39] Yes.
[678.00] The plan I have in my mind.
You will be happy when you hear it.
[683.89] Okay, come quickly.
[696.24] - Salam.
- Salam, Mr. Umar. How are you?
[698.17] - Yes, I'm good.
- Bhabi, how are you?
[699.84] - I'm good.
- We're starting a joint venture.
[702.91] And for this, we think we need
someone competent like you.
[710.23] And he's also looking for a decent job.
[713.25] Since I'm your in-law, I thought it
was my duty to inform you about this.
[719.63] Thank you so much, but I don't think
Umar needs any recommendations.
[725.20] He is capable and experienced,
and will easily find a job anywhere. .
[729.61] No, no, no.
[731.30] Mrs. Umar, it's not like that.
[732.65] We are not offering him a job
based on anyone’s recommendation.
[735.54] Rather, our organization needs
hardworking and honest people like Umar.
[742.09] Plus, we need an HR head,
[746.63] and I believe Umar is perfect for that.
[750.95] And it's not a recommendation.
And how could we not help in tough times?
[758.78] Right, sure.
[761.43] So consider it. Do think about it.
[765.26] Yes, I'll consider it.
[836.94] This jewelry is worth 5 crore!
Don't forget, and remember your promise.
[842.75] Why are you worried?
[846.11] Every word I've promised you,
I remember it very well.
[851.49] Let's go.
[881.56] No, no, son.
[882.79] See, Uncle, you can take as
much time as you need to think,
[888.92] but your answer should be yes.
[891.26] Plus, we are not doing you any favor.
Right, Mom?
[896.15] Shahzar is absolutely right.
[898.23] We need you, not the other way around.
[901.34] Our company needs you.
[903.29] I hope you will consider it
and don't disappoint us.
[906.36] - Please.
- We'll definitely consider it.
[912.09] - I think we should leave now.
- Yes.
[917.93] So, we'll take our leave then.
[919.73] I will tell the driver to drop you.
[921.18] No, no, no need for the driver.
We'll take a taxi from here.
[923.92] No, no. That's not even an option.
[926.04] - Not at all. Impossible! Shahzar, come on.
- No, no.
[928.58] - Driver.
- I'll call the driver. Please.
[933.29] I hope you had a good meal.
And that's everything was all right.
[936.11] Everything was all right, yes, thank
you so much. And beautiful arrangement.
[938.64] Thank you.
[942.36] - I'll go and check.
- Sure.
[949.23] I don’t know where he is.
[954.49] Thank God, our situation isn't so bad
[959.37] that we have to ask for help
from our daughter's in-laws.
[966.92] Umar, please tell them thanks,
but no thanks.
[972.38] How could you think that
I will accept their offer?
[977.24] Then why did you ask them for time?
That you'll think and let them know.
[982.52] I had just said it out of courtesy,
I couldn’t come up with another response.
[986.12] What could have I said?
[987.42] I am thinking of talking to
Shahzar in detail about this matter.
[995.22] Will Shahzar mind if you talk to him?
[998.39] I mean, I know you know better.
[1001.49] Just talk in such a way that he understands
your point of view,
[1005.59] but doesn't get offended.
[1014.53] Yeah, as if they're going to help us.
[1047.15] You looked really beautiful today.
[1053.10] I was considering myself
to be really lucky.
[1055.81] You didn't look bad either.
[1057.70] I saw some girls staring at you,
[1061.45] Really?
[1064.59] Obviously, I got so dressed up for you.
[1069.24] I'm almost the sole heir of the family,
[1071.86] so girls are going to stare at me,
but my luck—look at that!
[1077.04] I left all those girls
and married you instead.
[1082.58] You know what?
[1084.26] I was thinking the same thing.
[1086.35] I mean...
[1088.27] I mean, there was no shortage
of proposals for me either.
[1091.12] Some of the most handsome men, by the way,
[1096.44] and I ended up taking sleeping pills
for such a weird guy?
[1103.86] You took sleeping pills, but the
fun part is that it worked on me.
[1107.37] My mind went crazy,
and I ended up marrying you.
[1110.61] Wow!
[1114.67] On a serious note, Mom said you
should lock up your jewelry in the safe.
[1122.99] I forgot. She’s right.
[1125.02] There’s so much jewelry lying
around at home, and it’s not safe.
[1128.80] Where are you going right now?
[1131.84] I'll be back.
[1153.13] Rameen, come back already.
What are you doing?
[1161.61] What happened?
[1163.79] Shahzar...
[1165.46] my...
[1167.10] I can't find my jewelry.
It's not in any of these boxes.
[1170.22] What do you mean the jewelry’s not there?
don't panic.
[1172.71] - Tell me did you lock it?
- Of course I locked it!
[1177.38] I locked it.
[1179.34] - I locked it.
- Move, let me see.
[1182.24] I...
[1184.76] Maybe I forgot the key, but I locked it.
[1195.64] There's actually nothing in there.
[1199.44] - Are you sure you kept it here?
- Yes!
[1201.60] When I came, the door was ajar,
I thought... But--
[1205.83] - It was not--
- Relax, relax. We'll--
[1209.67] You go out. I... I'll check elsewhere.
[1219.55] I think before filing a report with the
police, we should search all the rooms.
[1226.22] Uncle, what do you think?
Who could have done this?
[1230.85] No one in the family can do this.
[1233.40] As for the staff,
I trust my servants completely.
[1237.58] They've been working here for 25 years.
[1240.33] No one would dare steal anything.
[1244.66] It seems like an inside job.
[1248.10] They knew everything about the house,
about the cameras.
[1251.39] It must some guest.
[1257.10] Uncle, what are you trying to say?
[1262.75] I think everyone understood
what I was trying to say.
[1268.35] The thief knew how to
turn off the CCTV cameras.
[1272.02] I will speak to the SHO and
personally oversee this inquiry.
[1277.41] There are only two guests in the house:
me and her.
[1281.15] If you suspect us, just say it.
[1283.30] Relax. That's not what Dad meant.
[1285.53] That's what your daddy was pointing at.
We're the only two guests here.
[1289.54] You're taking it the wrong way.
He didn’t mean it like that.
[1292.10] - You be quiet!
- No, Nano, no.
[1293.52] What's wrong with you?
Why are you getting so angry?
[1295.53] And you are not a stranger. You’re a part
of this house, we respect you a lot, right?
[1300.63] I don't think I said anything wrong.
[1304.43] I’ll personally look into this matter
with the SHO.
[1308.24] Wow! Now the police will be
called and we'll be searched! Right?
[1314.05] Amma, you be quiet.
He didn't mean it like that.
[1316.68] You be quiet! You always shut me up
in support of your husband.
[1321.25] What is your daughter-in-law going
to think?
[1323.47] What kind of people are we?
We rob our own house?
[1326.79] Nano, you listen to me. Dad didn't say
anything about you.
[1329.92] Why are you taking this
so personally unnecessarily?
[1332.04] Look, Shahzar, I'm requesting you.
Go and search my room right now.
[1336.30] Otherwise I'll leave this house.
[1337.82] - Man, what's wrong with everyone?
- Sir, the police is here.
[1341.88] - Go and check.
- I'll go and see.
[1432.90] Just keep supporting me like this,
[1436.12] and one day we’ll be billionaires.
[1440.53] My love, I’ll always support you,
[1445.07] at every step, at every turn.
[1447.89] I'm with you.
[1450.69] I know.
[1452.31] I trust you more than myself.
[1456.35] But, it's just...
[1458.95] - I'm only scared about one thing.
- What's that?
[1462.57] That when we go to Dubai,
you might forget me.
[1465.83] My love, that’s impossible.
[1468.65] If that was possible, then I wouldn't
have taken such a big risk for you.
[1473.11] Oh!
[1475.32] Is that true, Rohail?
[1477.63] I'm being completely honest,
I swear on you.
[1481.20] Tell me, has anyone suspected you at home?
[1485.38] No, why would they?
[1488.17] How could they suspect me?
I planned perfectly.
[1491.55] Thank God we turned off
the cameras at the right time;
[1495.27] otherwise, we’d both be in jail right now.
[1498.27] By the way, I admit it.
[1503.02] I haven’t met a smarter girl than you
in my entire life.
[1508.20] Now you believe in me, huh?
[1514.61] I only had my doubts before, but...
[1518.63] now I’m sure that...
[1522.83] someone from the family is involved
in this.
[1532.69] What are you trying to say? Say it openly.
[1536.48] If I'll say something, then...
[1539.44] - you'll feel bad, but...
- No, no. You don't worry about me.
[1547.35] You tell me what are you thinking.
[1553.78] I...
[1556.68] suspect Rameen.
[1564.65] What? You suspect Rameen?
[1567.82] Rameen?
[1569.41] What are you saying?
[1579.98] Do you even think what you're saying?
[1583.03] You’re accusing my wife
of stealing her own jewelry?
[1589.33] Try to understand what I'm saying.
[1591.58] - I mean--
- I don't want to hear anything.
[1595.34] All I know is that you're accusing your
daughter-in-law with something so cheap.
[1600.94] He's not accusing anyone.
Just listen to him.
[1605.11] I...
[1606.73] I'm not accusing Rameen of stealing,
but I'm suspecting her parents.
[1613.99] They're going through
a financial crisis now.
[1617.04] Hassan has a large loan from the bank.
[1619.83] It's possible Rameen's trying to help them
so she took the jewelry--
[1623.30] I don't want to talk to you
about any of this any further.
[1626.35] What do I even say to you, Dad?
[1632.98] And the people you're accusing
of stealing...
[1636.04] They're so proud
[1637.40] that they won't even accept a glass
of water from their daughter's in-laws.
[1640.21] They won't ever steal anything!
[1641.37] I'm not talking about stealing.
[1644.23] It's possible Rameen felt pity
for her family, that's why she...
[1651.33] Enough.
[1652.47] I won't tolerate any more disrespect
towards my wife in this house. That's it.
[1655.80] Calmly listen to him once.
Understand what he's trying to say--
[1659.56] I said enough, Mom!
[1663.28] I told you I don't want to talk about it
anymore. Please close this chapter here!
[1669.37] Our jewelry was stolen.
I don't mind that at all.
[1674.19] But if anyone brings this up in
this house again, they'll regret it!
[1686.89] Accusing someone without any evidence
isn't right.
[1691.52] He says whatever comes to his mind
whenever he's mad.
[1693.88] But, Tabinda,
I didn't expect this from you.
[1697.55] I can't take Shahzar's side on everything
and oppose him for the sake of it.
[1701.90] Sure, we have a lot of problems, but that
doesn't mean everything he says is wrong.
[1708.31] He has seen the world,
he has a lot of experience.
[1711.06] And I agree with him a 100 percent
in this matter.
[1714.97] I won't accuse her because of Shahzar,
I won't say anything to her, but...
[1720.24] but if this is true...
[1723.76] she has lost her place in my heart,
she has lost all respect.
[1734.42] Mama, all of my jewelry is gone,
only a diamond set is left.
[1739.11] There's nothing left, everything's gone.
[1742.03] Rameen...
[1743.95] This...
[1745.72] How did all of this happen?
[1748.47] Such a big incident.
[1751.44] Everyone was present
at the house yesterday
[1754.67] and there was such
tight security at the gate.
[1759.20] How did this happen?
[1761.25] Mama, I don't know how this happened.
[1764.96] Where's Shahzar?
Did he report it to the police?
[1768.66] Mama, there's no point.
Police has searched the entire house.
[1772.82] There's no proof of anything.
[1775.90] I can't believe this.
[1778.15] I don't understand. This is so weird.
[1782.01] No thief entered the house,
[1784.68] there's no doubt on the servants, so...
[1787.47] - who did something like this?
- I don't know, Ammi.
[1791.78] But it's been a great loss.
[1811.43] Here. You check.
[1813.98] It's cash.
[1824.16] What is this?
[1826.40] We had a deal of 50-50.
And this? A check worth 1 crore?
[1831.39] Yeah, so we can only withdraw this much
from the bank.
[1835.37] And you know selling jewelry is difficult.
[1840.05] All the jewelers I go to,
they ask for a receipt.
[1842.21] And I only sold half of it anyway,
the rest is in the bank locker.
[1854.14] What's wrong?
[1856.10] - Don't you have any patience?
- You keep this to yourself!
[1859.75] I don't have any patience!
[1861.43] I gave you jewelry worth 5 crore!
[1864.57] Do you know how many zeros are there
in 5 crore?
[1866.61] And this... this... You've me this check
worth one crore?
[1870.73] Oh, man.
[1872.20] Everything will be solved easily.
[1874.64] It's just for a few more days.
[1878.16] Then I'll give you all the money.
[1886.54] Anyway...
[1888.00] keep this check with you for now.
[1890.87] And don't just roam around with it.
[1893.98] Deposit it in the bank.
[1895.75] You keep this to yourself.
[1898.25] And I need my full share within a week!
Do you understand?
[1902.71] Oh, oh! Where are you going?
[1904.95] Sit. Listen to me.
[1907.13] Have some patience, some courage.
What's wrong with you?
[1911.75] What do you think?
[1913.34] Who am I doing all of this for?
[1915.95] I'm doing this for you?
[1918.27] Oh! Whatever I have, it's yours.
[1921.88] So you don't trust me, right? Don't!
[1924.95] - I'll jump right away!
- No, no, no!
[1937.71] Are you really...
[1941.15] doing all of this for me?
[1943.75] Sweetheart, who else am I doing it for?
[1947.34] I'm doing everything for you.
[1949.76] So that I can you give a peaceful life
filled with luxuries.
[1955.40] No matter what lengths I
have to go to achieve that.
[1959.74] I'll go!
[1961.42] And...
[1962.59] as long as you're with me...
[1967.03] then you'll see.
[1969.08] I'll take you so far.
[1973.29] Oh, Rohail, I'm with you
for the rest of my life.
[1979.04] You...
[1980.37] you don't know how much I love you!
[1986.00] I have an idea...
[1988.95] about how much you love me.
[1993.39] That's why I've taken such a big risk
for you.
[1998.61] What were you saying about Shahzar's
sister? You wanted to tell me something?
[2006.46] Yes.
[2008.04] Minal Malik.
[2010.87] She's a naive cow.
[2013.18] She's a very innocent, naive,
beautiful, pious girl.
[2017.32] You'll charm her in the blink of an eye.
[2021.78] Should I show you the picture?
[2041.79] She's cute.
[2061.24] I don't understand. You've stopped eating
about such a small matter.
[2064.99] Shahzar, a small matter?
[2067.53] All of my jewelry was stolen
from my own bedroom.
[2070.98] So?
[2072.46] This isn't a very big deal.
I'll get you new one.
[2074.82] Listen, I'm not fond of jewelry.
[2078.09] It's not that it was very high in value.
[2081.11] And it's such big deal, so much loss,
and we're just sitting ducks!
[2086.57] You shouldn't have stopped the police
from conducting their inquiry.
[2089.20] Okay, fine. What else could have I done?
You tell me.
[2091.86] No outsider came into the house.
[2094.17] They questioned all the servants, check the
servant quarters, what more could they do?
[2102.50] Anyway, man. Come on, I feel like going
on a long drive.
[2107.57] We'll have dinner too.
[2109.56] Please!
[2120.00] Hina, I've never worn these clothes before.
[2123.85] And these are all very expensive,
I got them made specially.
[2128.37] Some of these clothes are the ones 
I designed for Rameen's wedding,
[2132.75] I've only worn them once, so...
[2136.45] All of your dressed will be sold 
for 2-3 lakhs.
[2140.17] If you have some other things,
do let me know.
[2142.60] My friend's husband owns a showroom,
I can ask him to display it.
[2145.88] You'll get a handsome amount 
in a few days.
[2148.74] Crockery too? I have brand new
crockery sets. Dinner sets, tea sets.
[2153.93] - I haven't even opened them yet.
- Mehru, your crockery is expensive.
[2159.52] Think it through.
[2161.53] I don't have time to think. Right now,
I need cash instead of things.
[2167.04] Actually I was thinking of getting 
a second-hand car for Umar.
[2171.13] He has to bother with public transport
when he goes out to look for a job.
[2174.45] So let him!
[2176.18] He's man. Men have to face such situations
in life, Mehr-un-Nisa.
[2180.74] You've already done so much for Umar.
[2183.39] Now you're selling all your
expensive things to buy him a car.
[2187.64] You decorated this house 
with so much love and care.
[2191.81] You've already done Umar many favors.
[2194.37] Hina, if a wife does for her husband,
that's not a favor.
[2198.64] Don't talk this useless, deceitful
nonsense in front of me, Mehr-un-Nisa.
[2202.45] Idiot wives like you are the ones
who put their husbands on a pedestal.
[2206.02] Men are very close hearted.
[2209.62] They don't remember a woman's favors.
[2212.39] Hina, I didn't call you here
to give me a lecture.
[2214.94] Tell me if you can help,
otherwise I'll manage myself.
[2218.91] Fine. Don't get upset. Of course, 
I'll help. Get me a good cup of tea.
