this, find out from a friend, he must be somewhere there, he will come Manal was in a relationship with a friend, but why did he go, he came to know everything He also helped in getting Umar out of jail, what an honorable person he is, evidence has also been found against Rizwan, very soon he will also be arrested, then my name will also come up in the case, yes, God bless, why did this happen I am in a lot of trouble, I have also come to know everything about me and Umar Hasan, she doesn't even want to see my face, I don't understand what should I do, what trouble have I got into, don't cry son, don't cry, you are my brave daughter, you have seen big storms  Now it is a small storm, it will come and pass, I can tolerate it too, I do n't have the courage to face any storm now, I am very

to kill with this gun, now you and what is this file about, you just keep watching how I destroy that woman and her family, Shahnawaz uncle has not kept anything in the name of that woman or Manal, everything is in his and Shajar's name, that's why I got this property built so that I can get that old man to sign it in any way, and then tell me what will happen, we both will sell this property and go somewhere far away [Music], will you come with me, hold this, I don't want to fall into any of your traps earlier also, you have fooled me, now forgive me, come on friend, please forgive me, look Maria, I will not leave you, I will not cheat you, okay, who brought me to this house Hey, you are the one who brought me here and who introduced me to my love Manal? You did it. No brother, I cannot trust you. Earlier also, you had left me and went away and did not even check on me. No, I cannot do anything with you this time. Hey friend, now I will not leave you, I am saying this by swearing on my word. You are not believing me. No, I am not believing me. Don't believe me. Do one thing. You can shoot me with your own hands. Kill me and take my life. Hey, kill me [Music] No, no, hold this [Music] You tell me what to do this time. Whatever step you take, take it after a lot of thought. Hey, why are you worrying? This time, the plan that I have made has been made after a lot of thought. I will be able to make that woman suffer a lot, just the way she made me suffer. Hey, at that time my hands were tied, that's why I could not do anything, but now I will not leave her. This time I have made such a plan that she will remember that I have already ruined her daughter, now I will ruin her.  The time for destruction has begun [Music] Manal, it is not at all what you are thinking, I had told you earlier also that this man is not worthy of life, but she was not ready to listen to me, on top of that, this deceit of his, Uncle, you are misunderstanding, you left me for this girl, you have ruined my life because of me, no, Manal, there is nothing like that, look, I am bigger than you [Music] I love you, now hold this file, hey hold it, right [Music] [Music] File it, Sir, right now, let us sign the papers, the one who is your daughter, I will shoot her [Music] I killed her, no dad, you will not sign, this lie, house, bus, poor man, nothing happens with this, stop this nonsense, I will kill the Koli [Music] [Music] what have you done, hey, shoot me, I did not know, run, run, why are you [Music] [Music] the way we discussed about this case and the way we did it and it was also presented in the court and Umar Hasan is really  He is an innocent man and he did not commit any fraud, he did nothing. Is Baba innocent? Yes son, Umar Hasan was a truthful and honest man. He never betrayed anyone. He never cheated anyone. So son, clear the misunderstanding from your heart. So that case of embezzlement and those two crore rupees that were withdrawn from his account, what is all this? Regretfully, despite being his daughter, you could not understand him. You gave him a lot of pain. As for the cheque of two crores, Banda Malik, in collusion with the manager of Baker Andes, got Umar Hasan accused of embezzlement. And not only this, he also hatched many conspiracies inside Umar Hasan's advertising agency, due to which that company went into a crisis and had to suffer losses worth crores. Why did he do this? Because of your father had forbidden him to tell you, but the circumstances were such that we had to tell him. Son, see all the details in this file. [Music] Everything got spoiled because of this woman. Pupu, I lust my mother because my father is on the streets and I did not even know about it. I wish I had believed Baba then.  Then all this would not have happened, I would not have married Shajar, I am not Shamin, what happened, you see, you are not alone in this situation, I am with you and I am telling you that I will leave these people, no, no, I do not accept such a person as my husband, because of whose mother my whole family got ruined, Shajar, your mother manipulated me so much, that I started hating my dad, I started hating my father so much, I became so distant from my father, I am a bastard, son, listen to me, you are saying absolutely right, but do not get angry at this time, your health will deteriorate, father, please go from here, please I cannot talk to him right now, I cannot see his face, please go from here, Raman, listen to Shajar, son, what is he trying to say, you are not going from here, it is fine, I will go myself, Raman, Raman, what happened, you Raman, Ran, are you okay, Ran, thank you, thank you, there is a severe shortage of blood, at present, son, you have to do that.  We will put a drip but will give iron supplements later. You see, what a great news you have received, thank Allah, son. I will go and tell Shajar, he will go mad with happiness. No, Papa, please, I cannot spend my life with Shajar. If this child is born, I will file for divorce. What are you saying? You have come to your senses too. [Music] Hope, I have come to my senses today. I am not safe in the house where I am, how can my children be safe? A woman who killed my mother is responsible for the destruction of my father. How can she spend her life with her son? I hate every person and every relationship that is connected with Ta-Bida. No, Rami, it is not like that, son. You rest now, my daughter, everything is fine. [Music] Are you saying the truth? Thank you, thank you, up. Are you saying the truth? I am going to become a father. I will go and meet Raman right now. You cannot meet him. Do you know the reason? What is this? How can it be that someone's actions are punished?  I met him, if there is any crisis for Raman's family, what is my fault in it? Look, there is no use in arguing with him. It is better if you don't go in front of him. The passing time will make him understand what is right and what is wrong. And until Umar is released, she will stay with me. But you should try to understand what I am telling you. Understand my point. Umar is a sensible man. He wouldn't want his daughter's home to be ruined. And anyway, she has gone through a very difficult time. The doctor has forbidden her to take any stress. [Music] Who is it? [Music] Ramanri I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Baba. It's a big mistake. [Music] I've made a big mistake. I've made a big mistake. [Music] Sorry, I brought you [Music] Jun, now he's just [Music] Jana [ Music] My own search is [Music] Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, He will die. [Music] He respectfully, forgive me, Shajar, I did n't do anything. Shajar did everything because of that. He told me to forgive me, Shajar, look, I'm yours. I'm yours.  Shajar, I fall at your feet Shajan, please forgive me. All this was done by him. I didn't do anything Shajan, I haven't done anything. Shajan, please forgive me. I fold my hands to you. He did everything. I didn't do anything. Everything has happened because of him. Forgive me Shajar, please forgive me. I am from my language. Shajar, please listen to me. Forgive me. I am your feet. Shajar Shajar, come on, listen to me. Shadar, come on, no, no, listen to me [Music] What is this? This is everything that you wanted. For which you made our lives a spectacle. I transferred this house to your name. And some shares of the business too. What should I do [Music] For all this, you played with our lives. [Music] This is what you wanted, right? Yes, I really forgot. Umar Hassan broke your heart. [Music] To take revenge for your broken heart, you used all of us for that. I, the fool, kept thinking that now I will even get revenge from my own mother.  She is giving me so much love [Music] I did not know that how much hatred was hidden behind that love [Music] Because of thousands of revenge I lost everything [Music] While he was alive my father kept on explaining me but I kept on hating him I kept on saying good things to him I never listened to him just thinking that he was doing injustice to you I left my mother alone [Music] But you know that I am not the only one, everything has been snatched away from you too If my father has been snatched away from me then your husband from you If my sister has been snatched away from me then your daughter from you And if today Ran is leaving me then Umar Hasan has also snatched your heart [Music] What can I say to you [Music] Because at least I considered you as my mother Congratulations to you on this deserted and desolate house Congratulations to your broken heart And congratulations to the loneliness of the whole life This heart is that the desert is deeper than the ocean Who knows where the pain is How can I forget those stories that have passed through my heart No one knows why this happened to the placenta Baba  Why do children have to suffer for the deeds of their parents? In the whole house, she was the only one who took care of me. I have never seen a sensitive and innocent girl like her in my life. She was always worried that everyone is happy. Despite being so different from your mother, why doesn't she do all this with her? Son, understand that every person cannot take even one breath above the life that he has written for himself. I wanted to tell you a good news. It is a very good firm. It is a company from where I have been offered a job. They are paying a good salary. It is a good package. Yes, they are also offering a furnished apartment. This issue will also be resolved. We will have to shift there soon. You stayed here for so many days. They took care of you. It is a great favor of theirs. We have a very good woman. But son, Shajar has also helped us a lot. I want to say one thing. If you don't mind, then I would like to say that son, Shajar is a good boy. Forget whatever happened and go to your home with Shajar. This cannot happen. We travelled so much because of that woman. I have to leave her.  I can never forgive you [music] Shajar loves you, I tried to convince you again and again, but you did not listen to him even once. You should listen to him, son. I know all this. I know how much he loves me, but despite all this, I do not want to live with the person because of whose mother my family has gone through such a journey. I lust my mother. Your heart is very big, baba. I am not that strong. I cannot forgive him, son. One does not need strength to forgive. We are forgiving others, but in reality, we are achieving the happiness that is hidden behind this forgiveness. The virtue is in forgiveness, son. Please forgive me. I am in a lot of pain. I was crying a lot, pleading, asking for forgiveness. I feel as if she has lost her mental peace as well. Please forgive me, son. Which person can remain normal after losing everything? Whatever a person says, it hurts him. She is suffering for her own deeds and she will suffer for the rest of her life. Whatever she has done, she will suffer for the rest of her life.  I have given it to them, don't I? Even God will not forgive them [Music] Be careful and forget how those stories have passed, those stories which have happened to my heart, no one knows [Music] My child, my life, how lovely she is, she has gone exactly like you. Uncle, I have thought of a name for it. How does Meru sound like Meru to Nisa, I have also thought of a name, Manal, what kind of a name is it? [Music] A good name. If you keep this name, then I am very happy today. I feel as if all the happiness of the world has come together and come into my lap [Music] No one is attacking my heart, please come inside. Life has faded away on my breath [Music] Thank you, thank you so much [Music] Congratulations, oh please sit down, why are you standing? I have to go for a very important meeting [Music] I should go, we will not meet again. Come back to our life [Music] We have been homeless, upset, where have we gone, we have lost our way, whom should I tell about my condition? My heart is homeless, my heart is homeless [Music] [music]
