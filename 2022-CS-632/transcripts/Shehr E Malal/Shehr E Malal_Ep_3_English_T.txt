[19.59] Auntie, are you okay?
[20.86] - Mom?
- Oh, God!
[22.53] Mom?
[23.64] Mom, what happened?
[25.39] - Nothing, nothing.
- Auntie, are you okay?
[28.58] Can we go now?  We can come back later.
[31.10] I've been hearing these excuses
for the last two weeks.  Okay, here I go.
[36.60] Shahzar, if I got a new proposal,
[40.06] and parents said yes,
then please don't blame me.
[52.64] I've never seen you this troubled.
[57.16] You know, Rameen was asking
what happened to Baba.
[61.28] I just don't understand.
[63.69] You've never been like this.
[66.25] If you could share...
[69.39] Any problem-- Please!
[73.38] What do I tell you?
[76.08] There's no need to ask me any questions.
[77.53] In fact, for both you and your daughter,
it’s better not to ask me anything.
[83.26] And let me tell you something else too.
[86.05] I will not arrange a marriage for her
in this house under any circumstances.
[112.76] Shahnawaz...
[114.97] my problems and yours are separate.
[120.03] They may never be resolved,
[122.49] but you know very well that...
[125.42] I want Shahzar to be a successful man.
[128.88] He is about to make a very big decision
in his life, and... I
[133.46] fear he might make a mistake.
[138.56] What are you trying to say?  Bottom line.
[145.93] He is completely
trapped in that girl's web.
[150.66] I don't trust those people.
[154.92] Why are you being covert?
Speak plainly.
[160.26] Shahnawaz, it’s not so easy to talk to you.
[163.80] I wanted to consult you, but... -
[166.91] you...
- Look, Tabinda.
[168.72] I'm sorry.  But you haven't been
a good wife.
[175.62] but I have issues in saying
that you're a good mother.
[180.80] If you don't like this proposal...
[183.61] - just say no.
- I can't do that.
[187.11] Because I'm the stepmother.
[190.41] Stepmothers are always stepmothers.
[193.19] Her decisions are separate too.
[195.80] If I make a decision, the world will say I didn’t care
about Shahzar’s happiness.
[202.47] So what are your objections?
[204.52] I've inquired about that family.
[207.30] Rameen's father comes
from a lower-class family and...
[212.79] married his wife out of greed.
[215.66] Later, he cleverly, or by cheating, or
however, he took everything in his name.
[222.02] This is what I found out.
[223.60] and now Rameen's marriage to Shahzar...
I don't know what they are thinking.
[230.27] - I just wanted to inform you.
- Wh-- what are you saying?
[234.78] I'm right.
[236.93] I've thoroughly inquired everything.
[240.53] This is what I found out.
[242.38] This is why I'm worried
and wanted to consult you.
[250.97] You've said something very strange.
[253.44] Omar Hassan's daughter and your son!
[259.88] This is a big shock for me too.
[263.23] That man who broke off all our relations,
our engagement,
[267.95] left me for a wealthy woman...
[271.41] his daughter will get married
and come to my house?
[274.45] Impossible!
[275.57] You can do whatever you want,
[277.26] but the decision must come from Shahnawaz.
[280.25] After all, he is the real father.
And you're just the stepmother.
[286.05] No, this won't happen.
[289.09] The rejection will come from
Shahnawaz himself.  Don't worry.
[292.50] - Why would he reject though?
- We'll need to think of something.
[296.09] If he finds out that you're
behind all of this, then?
[301.79] You will need to be very
careful with your steps.
[305.02] I'll see what I have to do.
[307.27] Let's see.
[309.95] I thought of inviting you
to the house first.
[314.44] But then I thought...
[316.99] it's better to talk over the phone.
[318.90] Go ahead, give your command, Sir.
[320.81] The information you gave
about Umar Hassan and his family...
[325.24] I heard it all through Tabinda.
[327.92] But I still want to hear it from you.
[333.47] What should I say?
They're nothing but two-timing people, he
[336.81] 's the worst kind of man, and... I don't want to say it
[340.08] , but...
[341.93] it's not a good idea to form
any relationship with such a family.
[348.31] It's been a while since we
returned from Rameen's house.
[350.63] Why haven't you all made a decision yet?
[354.14] I can't make this decision,
it's for your father to decide.
[358.34] But honestly, I really liked her.
I really liked Rameen.
[362.38] I feel like you both
are made for each other.
[367.09] So why don't you move forward with it?
[369.65] Again?  How can I move things forward?
This is a decision for your dad to make.
[375.58] He is your real father.
[377.50] I'm not your real mother.  It's his right.
[381.06] Why are you saying that?
[383.20] You are just like a real mother to me.
[386.84] Besides, you've always made decisions
in this house.
[389.99] - You'll decide about my marriage too.
- Look, this...
[393.42] this is your life, your marriage.
[397.13] And this decision belongs to your father.
[402.24] I've told you.
[403.98] We won't argue about this.
It's my marriage, and I want you to decide.
[409.31] But how can he decide when he’s
never shown any interest in family matters?
[414.22] I'm sure he doesn't care about this at all.
[416.21] All right, fine.  Let's go
to Rameen's place tomorrow.
[419.32] - Really?  Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
[423.44] Thank you.
[426.74] I'll go and tell Rameen.
[433.66] Mom!  Oh, God!  I'm so happy!
[439.51] - What happened?  Tell me.
- The news is so good!
[442.85] - Tell me, what happened?
- You'll go crazy hearing this!
[446.38] One second.
[448.44] Such a drama queen!  Tell me quickly.
[451.41] Shahzar called.
[452.95] He said his mom liked us and they’re
coming tomorrow to finalize everything.
[458.67] I'm so happy.
[460.84] Oh, hello!
[463.85] - Hello!  I'm good.
- How are you?  How was office?
[466.12] Okay, we'll talk about everything later.
[470.84] Shahzar called.  And he told me his mom...
[474.29] Dear, please don't mention this guy
's name in front of me again.
[484.40] You didn't tell her about my decision?
[489.37] Which decision?
[495.14] Do you have any objections?
[499.56] Dear, forget about this guy.
[504.71] We've already fixed your engagement
with Arshad, Mr.  Mazoor's son.
[508.60] They're coming in two days
for the formal engagement.
[511.93] You can't do this to me!
You're joking, right?
[518.17] You think I'd joke with you?
[522.08] You know that I love Shahzar.
Despite knowing that, you're doing this?
[526.96] - Don’t you care about my happiness at all?
- I'm only doing this for your happiness.
[533.74] Understand?
[535.57] But my happiness is only
with Shahzar, Baba.
[539.20] I can't think of anyone else.
[542.83] Please.  Please don't do this.
[555.53] We've given them our word, dear.
[558.80] We come from a well-reputed family.
[562.05] We don't go back on our word.
[568.05] Talk to her.
[578.92] The menu for today is lavish,
especially your favorite biryani.
[584.65] Your mom made everything.  Look.
[587.82] - Really?
- What?
[590.03] Mom in the kitchen for the whole day?
I still can't believe this.
[593.20] - Be quiet and eat your food.
- Mom, she's right actually.
[597.34] Even I can't believe it.
[598.67] That such a busy
business woman like yourself,
[600.84] can also take time out to cook as well as
a housewife!
[607.23] This is all because of Rameen bhabi.  After
all, your proposal has been finalized.
[611.58] Thank you.
[613.94] Rameen?
[616.00] Who is this Rameen that she's referring to
as her sister-in-law?
[619.39] I had already told you
that Shahzar likes Rameen
[623.65] and that we need to take a proposal to
their house.
[627.33] But I think I've rejected that proposal.
[641.80] Yes, but there’s no harm
in meeting once, right?
[645.60] Enough!
[653.20] I've had enough of this.  You've been
making decisions in this house as you wish.
[659.55] Shahzar is my son, my child!
[662.12] A man like Umar Hassan...
[665.96] a greedy man like him...
[667.68] it's impossible for him to
become his son-in-law.
[671.89] It's too much now!
[674.93] But, Dad...
[679.30] Why are you saying this?
What are your objections?
[682.62] I have no objections to you marrying
that girl.
[687.64] But for a man like Umar Hassan
to become my in-law?  That's impossible.
[695.37] I've lived my life as I could,
[699.49] but I would never want you to live the kind of
life I've lived.
[714.65] Mama, how can Baba do this to me?
[717.86] He was this stone-hearted before.
[721.11] He never denied me anything my entire life.
[724.07] He listened to everything I said.
[725.78] But now, when it comes to my marriage,
he has taken a one-sided decision.
[731.16] He knows how much I love Shahzar, Mama.
[735.96] but you just stood there listening,
and didn't say anything.
[741.15] You please go and talk to him.
[743.62] He listens to everything you say.
[744.79] Please talk to him.
He'll agree if you talk to him.
[747.50] What do you think, love?  That I didn't
try to explain it to him?  Talk to him?
[751.66] He won't listen.  What can I do?
[754.71] I knew you would say this.
[757.70] You've spent your whole life
bowing your head before Dad.
[760.84] You've never stood up for me.
[763.03] Please, listen to me.  Please.
[765.04] Give me some time.  I'll talk to him again.
I promise you.
[769.26] You won't do anything now
because you can't.
[772.38] Whatever there is to do now, I'll do it.
[774.73] I'll go without eating for two days,
he'll soften up and listen to me!
[780.36] So you're going
to emotionally blackmail father?
[783.71] I'll do everything
if he won't listen to me!
[786.19] You will do no such thing!  Do you hear me?
[788.71] I just want to know
why he rejected the proposal.
[792.45] I don't know!  I asked him a lot!
[795.34] He's not telling me.
[798.60] If Dad thinks...
[801.16] I'll marry anyone other than Shahzar,
tell him he's mistaken.
[809.74] That will never happen.
[822.86] By rejecting that proposal, you’ve
proven to me that no matter what you say... I
[829.30] do hold some importance in your life.
[834.83] Thank you.
[838.29] Everything I did...
[842.05] I did for my son's happiness...
[844.83] and for his better future.
[849.48] You shouldn't be under the illusion...
[852.86] that I rejected that proposal just for you.
[857.47] Nor should you be under the illusion
that I have feelings for you.
[864.27] Shahzar...
[866.26] is my son, my child.
[869.38] I will make the decisions for his life.
[874.08] I would never want him
to live the kind of life I've lived.
[881.05] I won't let someone like
you—greedy, manipulative, self-centered,
[887.43] and low class—cast a
shadow over his life.
[894.79] Got it.
[896.58] Get lost!
[910.23] I'm telling you, don't worry.
I'll convince him.
[916.23] I know exactly what he's doing.
[920.07] He just wants to hurt me and you.
[923.69] First he hated you...
[926.17] now he hates me too.
[929.56] Be patient.  Things will be okay.
[934.38] How much more patience can I have?
[937.23] How much more patience can I have?
I've lost my patience!
[941.75] I've seen him humiliate you
my whole life...
[945.39] disrespect you.
[948.14] He didn't value a woman, a wife like you.
[952.20] He's a sadist.
[954.66] He cannot be happy himself,
nor can he see others be happy.
[958.70] Okay, enough.  He's your father.
[960.06] He is my father
but I have always listened to him,
[964.40] followed what he said.
[967.09] And now when the time comes for
him to listen to me, he doesn't trust me.
[970.31] And honestly speaking,
I don't trust him anymore.
[973.30] You trust me?
[975.17] What kind of a question is that?
Of course I trust you.
[978.06] You are the only one who understands
my heart, and not just understands me,
[983.18] but also fulfills my every wish.
[987.10] Let me handle this matter then.
[989.37] No.
[991.44] I can't let you be humiliated
because of me.
[995.30] This is my matter, and the time has come
for me to speak to him directly.
[1000.02] I will do it today.  Right now, in fact.
[1003.14] Listen.
[1014.19] Do you really think...
[1015.97] he will just sit quietly and listen to you?
[1020.03] It's impossible.
[1022.57] I know Shahzar better than you do.
[1025.99] He's stubborn and very principled.
[1028.78] Once he makes a decision, he sticks to it.
[1032.39] That clever woman has poisoned his mind.
[1036.19] My son is not so rude or ill-mannered.
[1039.40] He’s a grown man now, and that doesn’t
mean he can talk back to his father.
[1045.36] What is your problem?
[1048.28] Tell me clearly.
[1050.22] I found out some strange things
about that girl's father.
[1054.47] He comes from a lower-class background.
[1057.31] And then, in his quest to become rich
, he married his boss's daughter, took
[1061.62] all the property,
[1063.52] and spent his life in luxury at the
expense of that orphan girl's wealth.
[1066.75] But what’s Rameen’s fault in this?
[1069.51] Why should the daughter suffer
for her father's sins?
[1071.67] Who am I to punish people?
[1075.49] Whether the girl is good or bad,
I don't care.
[1079.19] What I care about is my son, Shahzar,
and my family’s name.
[1085.20] He can never find a naive
and foolish son-in-law like Shahzar.
[1090.72] You have no right...
[1093.40] You have no right to
[1094.39] accuse a respectable man like Umar Uncle
based on their own temper and behavior.
[1099.59] You have no right to use
such words about him.
[1101.89] Do you see the tone
he's using to talk to me?
[1107.85] - You've taught me this.
- Shut up.
[1112.41] Phuppo, you make him understand this.
[1114.44] If he has a valid reason for rejecting
this proposal, he should explain it to me.
[1119.41] If not, then...
[1122.56] I’ll be forced to go to Umar Uncle and
ask for Rameen’s hand in marriage myself.
[1126.98] I know!
[1128.55] I know who's filling your mind
with these things.
[1131.30] That woman has poisoned your mind so much
that now you're standing against me that--
[1135.31] No one has filled my heart with hatred.
[1138.54] She has taught me how to love, Dad!
[1140.85] You sowed the seeds of hatred in my heart.
[1143.76] You always made me resent that woman.
[1146.45] Against a woman who took care
of your own child even more than her own!
[1151.96] A woman who served you her entire life.
And what did you do in return?
[1155.75] You always hated her,
[1157.65] never gave her respect.
You never gave her a place in this house.
[1162.23] Don't you realize that this house
was just an empty house before?
[1167.15] It was that woman who turned
your empty house into a home, a paradise.
[1171.52] And in return, you always hated her,
mocked her.
[1176.20] And what did she do in return?  Nothing.
[1179.04] Nothing but surrender to you.
[1182.16] She is a much bigger person than you!
[1184.37] She has taught me so much,
[1186.48] given me such a good upbringing, and made me
capable of standing on my own two feet.
[1191.88] But you never did any of that.
[1194.09] I'm really sorry to say this,
I didn't want to, but I have to.
[1198.97] You are an extremely self-centered,
[1202.36] ungrateful, and selfish person.
[1204.48] And do you know
what your biggest problem is?
[1206.80] You think every person
in the world is a liar.
[1210.57] You're a sadist.
[1212.81] You can't be happy yourself,
and you can't see anyone else happy,
[1216.48] even if it's your own child.
[1218.93] Shahzar, son, calm down and speak sensibly.
[1222.04] How can I stay calm?
[1223.15] I can't stay sane in this madhouse,
maybe you can.
[1227.78] That's why I've made a decision.
[1229.55] If his behavior doesn't change, I
won't tolerate it anymore.
[1233.07] As soon as the morning comes,
I'm leaving this house, forever.
[1237.47] So you'll rest after licking stones
like a fish?
[1241.27] If you think so, then yes,
that's exactly what I'll do.
[1244.12] So what are you waiting for?
[1247.55] Why are you waiting for the morning?
[1249.08] Leave this house right now.
[1251.82] And if you don't leave yourself, I'll call
the servants and have them throw you out.
[1261.35] I won't need that.
[1264.97] I'm your son, Dad.
[1267.67] I'm leaving on my own.
[1269.52] And I won't ever come back.
[1270.86] - Shahzar!
- Let him go.
[1272.21] - Shahzar!
- Let him go.
[1273.27] - Shahnawaz, he's leaving, stop him!
- Let him go!
[1275.63] - Stop him, he's leaving!
- Let him go!
[1278.39] He'll be outside for a few days.  Once
he faces some difficulties, he will learn.
[1282.40] All his fantasies of love will fade away.
[1285.20] They've been flaunting
their father's wealth.
[1288.00] When he goes to ask for her hand
empty-handed and broke, then he'll learn!
[1312.90] What-- what have you done?
[1315.49] - You've thrown your son out of the house.
- I didn't throw him out;
[1319.12] He left on his own.
[1321.52] He wants to waste my hard-earned wealth
on that girl.
[1324.54] How could he even think of bringing
the daughter of that rogue into this house?
[1330.23] Everyone knows about his bad reputation.
[1332.52] You're right, but this wasn't the solution.
[1335.72] Now he has the chance.  He'll go for a
court marriage tomorrow.  What will you do?
[1339.04] What lesson will you teach him?  Nothing!
[1342.06] I only told you to reject the proposal,
and I'll handle everything else.
[1346.30] Your anger and rashness
are always causing big problems!
[1350.57] But you don't understand!
[1370.70] Listen.
[1373.75] How is she?
[1375.22] Did she eat?
[1378.54] What do you expect after punishing
someone so severely without reason?
[1383.32] Don't you know about Rameen?
[1385.43] How do you think she'll be?
[1386.64] I'm doing this for her good.
Why don't you understand this?
[1390.17] Umar, how can I understand you
[1392.18] when you never gave me
any reasons for your rejection?
[1395.77] Share it with me or don't you trust me?
[1398.73] Oh, I trust you more than myself.
[1401.50] But why are you not understanding me?
I can't explain it because of your illness!
[1407.18] But I have some reservations
about their family background.
[1412.50] They are beyond our means.
[1414.54] His mother is very arrogant,
very proud about it.
[1417.71] How can such a woman be a
good mother-in-law for my daughter?
[1420.72] What don't we have?
[1421.98] We will give our daughter
everything, God willing.
[1424.38] Fine, we gave her everything, and yet
she’s not happy in her own home.  Then?
[1430.28] That's it!  I've said it.
[1431.81] Mr.  Manzoor is coming in two days
with his son.  I won't delay this marriage.
[1435.66] I'm sorry, Umar.
[1438.53] I can't support you on this.
[1440.46] Because I don't agree with this.
[1442.88] Fine, you rejected Shahzar's proposal.
[1445.98] But you're going to force your only
daughter to marry against her will?
[1451.55] Rash decisions always lead to mistakes.
[1457.48] Me-- Mehr!
[1470.51] I'm really shocked
by what your dad has done.
[1474.12] He threw his only son out of the house
for such a small thing.
[1477.98] Mr.  Umar anyway belongs
to a respectable family.
[1481.10] I've heard great things about him.
[1483.26] Then what are your dad's objections?
[1485.58] He's just being stubborn.
[1488.30] And you know he always goes against things that
Mom and I like.
[1493.68] I don't understand.
Man, I can't believe it!
[1496.01] Is there any father in this world who would
place his own ego above his child's wishes?
[1501.91] It's unbelievable.
[1503.36] Don't lose hope.
[1504.64] In a few days, he'll soften.
He will accept your happiness.
[1508.50] Maybe it's because
we haven't met in a long time,
[1510.00] which is why you don't know about my dad.
[1513.91] He's a very stubborn man
and he won't let this go.
[1517.44] But I'm also his son.
[1519.80] I'll see how long he can stay stubborn for.
[1522.48] I've made my decision.
I won't go back home.
[1525.32] I'll marry only Rameen,
or I won't marry at all.
[1529.30] What do you think?  I...
[1532.09] was thinking of going to Umar Uncle
and talking about Rameen myself.
[1537.98] I'm just waiting for a proper living
arrangement, a job first, and then I'll go.
[1545.36] You don't need to worry.
You can stay here as long as you want,
[1549.59] and as far as the job goes,
everything will fall into place.
[1553.97] Drink your coffee.
[1555.69] Thank you, my friend.
[1570.95] Here.
[1573.00] Eat through my hands.
[1575.45] Eat!
[1577.21] What am I telling you?
[1579.89] You haven't eaten
anything since morning, dear.
[1582.47] - Eat.
- I don't want to eat!
[1584.78] Give me poison.
[1587.56] Your brother is already troubling me.
[1590.56] Now you're also troubling me.
[1593.48] Why does Dad always do this to us?
[1595.60] Every time there's a moment of happiness,
he ruins it.
[1599.74] We were all so excited
for Shahzar bhai's wedding.
[1603.91] Phuppo, I’ve seen it in Rameen’s eyes;
She loves Shahzar bhai deeply.
[1610.10] No one could love him more than she does.
[1613.14] You should talk to Dad.  Explain to him.
[1616.09] If you explain, he'll agree.
[1620.04] Okay, all right.
[1622.98] I'll talk to him.
[1624.59] I'll convince him.
[1626.46] You don't worry at all.
[1628.79] But promise me you won't cry anymore.
[1632.72] And eat something from my hands?
Come on.
[1636.45] Come on, open your mouth quickly.
[1638.95] Good.
[1640.97] Good, very good.
[1643.77] That's more like it.
[1659.02] Where are you, Shahzar?  I've been
calling you for so long.  Check your phone.
[1663.40] Do you have any idea how worried I am
because of you?
[1666.76] I'm really sorry, Rameen.
[1668.41] Actually, there’s been some tension
at home, so I couldn’t get in touch.
[1671.57] Is everything all right?
[1673.88] No, there's tension at my house too.
Do you know what happened?
[1677.14] Your proposal got rejected by Dad
before it was even official.
[1681.79] He wants me to marry
some friend's son instead.
[1686.87] What?
[1688.22] He did that?
[1692.09] Okay, I... I'll call you.
[1704.38] Why don’t you go to Umar
Hassan’s office yourself
[1706.78] and talk to him about the proposal?
[1710.22] It doesn't seem appropriate for me
to go there now.
[1712.43] Why don't you go and talk to him?
[1716.18] I could go, but you know your dad.
[1719.06] Who knows what his reaction will be?
[1720.84] He will divorce me
or throw me out of the house.
[1724.10] You're right.
[1726.21] Forget it.  Don't go.
Let's see what happens.
[1730.36] On second thoughts.
[1732.50] I'm ready to take this risk for you, tell
me when I should go?
[1735.91] Why would you do this?  I
[1738.36] know very well that if Dad finds
out I went there, he won't react,
[1742.58] but if he finds out about you,
it'll cause a storm in the house.
[1747.07] Shahnawaz...
[1749.70] I understand the reasons for his rejection.
[1751.37] Rameen's background, Umar Hassan's past.
[1754.05] But Umar Hassan's refusal to this proposal
makes no sense to me.
[1760.82] Even Rameen doesn't know that.
[1762.83] I've asked her many times, but... I
[1766.34] think he just didn't like us
from day one.
[1769.39] That's how his reaction seemed to me.
[1772.38] The day you got sick.
[1786.10] I thought it was just infatuation,
and it would pass in a few days,
[1790.02] but now it seems serious.
[1792.35] All boys and girls are like this these
days.  They all go through these phases!
[1798.03] No, he just became a mad lover.
[1802.17] He doesn't have the shortage of girls
around him either.
[1803.90] In fact, have you seen how
Shahzar is the first boy in our family
[1808.24] for whom girls are sending proposals.
[1811.13] I think the girl must be very beautiful.
[1814.70] Oh, no!  Not at all.  She's nothing special.
The matter is of the heart, not looks.
[1820.88] Oh, forget it.
[1822.44] Try to manage Shahnawaz.
[1824.89] His anger is quick,
but don't let him soften for his son.
[1830.57] And remember, he shouldn't
find out about your past with Umar.
[1837.88] He already hates you,
[1839.97] but if he finds out about this, I do
n't know what will happen.
[1844.01] You're right.
[1846.08] I realize this.
[1849.69] I'll be careful.
[1853.53] If you're here to talk about Rameen's
proposal, I've already rejected it.
[1860.76] I don't want to discuss it further either.
[1864.10] The best thing for you is to let
your mother choose someone for you.
[1871.28] - Just listen to me for two minutes.
- I have to go for an important meeting.
[1876.83] If this is not about Rameen,
we can meet tomorrow evening.
[1881.39] It is about Rameen.
[1890.31] - Rameen and I love each other.
- Enough!
[1899.00] In my office...
[1901.58] for my daughter...
[1905.30] I don't like this.
[1910.23] Why are your objections?  Please tell me.
[1912.54] I've already arranged a marriage
for my daughter with my friend's son.
[1918.36] He's becoming a surgeon, a big surgeon.
[1923.79] You know that you're not just being unfair
to me, but to your daughter too.
[1931.86] Son, Rameen is my daughter.  A daughter!
[1937.98] And as a father, I have the right
to make decisions for her.
[1945.66] Thank you.
[1964.76] Your son came to my office today.
[1969.70] To talk about his relationship,
[1971.85] and I told him clearly: it won't happen.
[1975.73] Don't be happy with your rejection;
[1979.42] We'll come to your home
and beg for the relationship.
[1985.41] Tell Rameen to stop dreaming
about marrying Shahzar.
[1989.55] Otherwise, her name will be ruined
in the whole society.
[1993.03] What can you do apart
from these cheap tricks?
[1996.18] What hope do I have from you?
[1999.22] I can do a lot, but I don't want to.
[2001.82] It’s better for her to step back
so that this matter can be resolved easily.
[2006.93] Look, Madam Tabinda, there’s no
shortage of proposals for my daughter,
[2010.22] and there’s nothing special
about your son either.
[2015.26] I won't send my daughter to your house
as long as I live.
[2017.55] Living with you in your home
is like living in hell.
[2023.60] And let me tell you,
[2025.35] within a week, I'll arrange my
daughter's marriage, and you'll see.
[2029.19] In a better and a bigger family
than yours.
[2032.43] Of course!  You should definitely invite us.
[2046.33] Why didn't you tell me what happened
to my dad?
[2049.26] It's better
if you ask your father yourself.
[2051.83] Shahzar, what do I ask him?
He's in such a bad mood since yesterday!
[2055.41] Didn't you even try to get him to agree?
[2058.58] In fact, he didn't even listen to me.
[2061.09] He kicked me out of his office, saying
[2062.89] that he's arranged your marriage
to someone better than me.
[2068.27] My father can't say something like that.
[2070.88] My father's opinions about your father
are absolutely correct.
[2075.22] He’s a materialistic man.
[2078.91] - He married your mother for money and--
- One minute, Shahzar.
[2083.51] Just because I love you doesn't
mean I'll let you speak ill of my father.
[2089.95] I'm sorry, but the truth is the truth,
[2092.92] and I've called to let you know
that I'm going back to my home.
[2099.85] It means you're giving up?
[2102.06] I left home because of you,
[2104.59] but now that we can't get married, what do I do?
[2110.49] Rameen, I think fate has decided
we can't be together.
[2116.78] You... you'll leave me?
[2118.97] What can I do?
[2121.08] I can't make you run away with me
and marry you against your father's wishes.
[2125.63] So I don't have any other options.
[2128.67] We can try, please!
