Talk to me frankly.
what are you trying to say? The job he's showing off about these days,
my mother-in-law made it happen. Because his own reputation is so bad
that no one wants to employ him. Mr.  Umar, I have checked the quotations
and it is ready for your signature. This is a risky job,
you'll have to be careful. Keep it in your bag.  -What ...what is this?  -These
are the birth control pills. I didn't expect this from this woman. How low can someone go?
I'll talk to Shahzar. Please, Omar.  Don't get involved
in this matter. Why shouldn't I be involved, dear? She is upset with us, but that doesn't mean we throw her into
the swamp and leave her alone. She's not alone in being taunted
for being childless! Is this a joke?  I'm still alive!
I can handle this situation! I know, Omar. Rameen doesn't want us to get
involved in any matters with her in-laws. Because it will be difficult
for her at the end. She is already very upset with both of us. The gynecologist just told
her to avoid stressful situations. Our daughter is wise, touch wood.
She will find a solution herself. Here you go! Your brother has ordered
your favorite Manchurian for you. Now you have to eat it, because I made this
plate myself for the first time in my life. And look, I won't take a bite
from your plate today. All of this food, you must eat it all. Okay, let's do this. If you don't feel like eating, then I'll make a bite for my sister
and feed her myself. here you go. Minal. How long will you keep on starving? Everyone at home is worried about you. Please eat it. No, with my hands. Come on. And tell me how is it? I don't understand... how to bring back Minal's happiness
and smile. How do I bring her back to life? God is willing, everything will be fine,
don't worry. Have patience.  Patience. I don't have the strength.
I can't have patience. I'll have to do something. what can you do?  what can you even do? I can do a lot. I'm only quiet because of Shahnawaz. He cares about the family's honour
and reputation. And I'm dying to take revenge. I'll find him. Wherever he is, I'll find him. I won't let him go so easily. I cannot forgive him. Absolutely not. I'll find him. I also want revenge from Kamran. And I'm also looking forward
to his downfall. I can give his address and phone number,
but... if Khala finds out about Kamran and me, the doors of this house
will be closed for me forever. I'm living the life of luxury here. Such a good job, a wonderful job,
and a wealthy prospect like Shahzar. I can't let go of all of this so easily. What can I do to kill the snake
without breaking the stick? Hello? I need to talk to you about
something very important. What is so urgent? You don't need any money, do you? No, it's something really important, but
promise me you won't tell anyone, okay? All right. Ka... I have to talk to you about Kamran. The guy who was fooling Minal
by pretending to be Kamran Shah. I want to talk about him. Look, Khala is desperate to take
revenge from him no matter what, and she will talk to you about this too. Just think, if you help Khala and Uncle to
capture Kamran, think of the position
you will have in their eyes. Uncle will give you a promotion
in the blink of an eye! and Khala, who gives
you millions for small tasks, this is about her daughter. Don't talk in circles.  Come to the point. I can help you capture Kamran. But there is one condition:
Khala cannot find it. How do you know Kamran? I can't trust anyone in Kamran's matter. Please book my ticket and hotel. I'll tell Shahnawaz and Shahzar
that I'm going for a meeting. Why don't you understand?  Look,
one day or another, everyone will find out that you didn’t go for a meeting
but were looking for Kamran. I make my own decisions.
I don't need any suggestions from anyone. I know that.  Who knows it better than me? Look, all I'm trying to tell you is finding someone in a city like Dubai,
when you have no information about them, is not an easy job. It's not that difficult either.
We have many connections. We know a lot of people. We can take help from the police, we
have his pictures, we have the information. Wow, wow, I salute your thinking. But didn't you think that even
if you catch him with the police, the whole city will know that Shahnawaz
Malik's son-in-law was arrested for theft? How will Shah Nawaz Malik feel?
What will happen to him? He told the whole family that his
son-in-law is in Dubai for business. what do you want me to do?  You want me to
let him go so easily, without consequences? I shouldn't get him punished? Oh, we'll punish him ourselves! We'll scare him, we'll threaten him, we'll tell him that in Dubai, stealing
means getting your hand chopped off. He'll get scared and return
our money and jewellery. Listen to me and understand me. Give me a little time,
if he’s not in your feet by then, change my name to something else. Now, cheer up! Oh, Mehru. Why did you come to
the kitchen in this heat? Not at all.  Actually, Umar asked
for chicken biryani after a long time, and I thought I’d surprise both you
and him. Okay, as you wish. I'll just cut the grapefruit. Look at this. Okay, I'll check it. Ammi! What happened?  Mehru!  Mehru? What happened to you, dear?
Open your eyes.  Mehru ?  Mehru! Mehru, open your eyes!  Mehru?  Mehru!  Mehru ?  Oh my God!  have mercy.
What do I do? I'll call Omar. Yes? Yes, yes, Ammi.  It's me.  What happened? What?  what are you saying? How?  Did she faint?  When? But-- all right. Okay, you don't worry.  I'll be there in
10 minutes.  It'll take me 10 minutes. Oh-- Okay, I'll call an ambulance.
Wait. We have to take her to the hospital.
We can't leave her like that. And listen.  Don't call me Rameen. No, no, no.  Don't tell her.
She'll get worried. I'll tell you Shahzar myself. You didn't tell me that
she is a cancer patient. No, she isn't anymore.
She was a long time ago. She was being treated in America for
a while.  She also had a surgery there. Yes, the surgeons there assured
that the tumor would not grow again. The tumor was removed... but the cancer has spread throughout her body. Now, you should get her shifted to a good
hospital so she can get timely treatment. If you want, I will send her reports
to a good hospital, but you will need to admit
her there immediately, and they might recommend
surgery right away. So please be mentally prepared for this. - Surgery?  -Yes
. The cancer has spread throughout her body,
and it's very difficult to control, but don't worry, with timely treatment and prayers,
it can be controlled. I will discharge her tomorrow morning, and as soon as I get a response from
the cancer hospital, I will inform you.  Is everything right?  Okay.  Did you see, Khala? Despite all your efforts,
Shahzar hasn't lost trust in Rameen. I don't know what she has done,
he is always singing her praises. You don't waste your time by thinking
about all of this. Just focus on what
you've been tasked to do. Things are in motion. I'm giving him the medicine as well. And the fake reports you asked
for will be ready in two days. You will get your money tomorrow. I'm not doing this work out
of greed for money, Khala. Really? then what else do you want? Shahzar. Shahzar? Have you gone mad? Huh?  Are you mad? You are dreaming about marrying Shahzar? You know your status, right? Look, Khala, just like how
Shahnawaz Uncle married you, leaving so many other women behind,
so I can also marry him like this. Now, after Shahzar's divorce, you
will get him married to someone else, so why can't I be that girl, Khala? Are you competing with me? No, no, Khala, how
could I compete with you? God forbid!  No, no,
you're misunderstanding me. Look, I'm just saying that Shahzar listens
to you. If you ask him, he will agree.  You... You convince him to marry me, Khala. Oh madam. You can stay in this house as a guest, but you will never be the daughter-in-law.
do you understand? I think we should tell Rameen
about her mother's condition. You should tell her.  I can't...
I can't gather the courage. What do the doctors say?
Will Mehru survive? The doctors didn't give any hope. You don't worry. God is great. He saved her before too, right? He will create a way for her again. Nothing is impossible for Him. The doctors say there's no point
in further treatment. But still, if you insist, we will... The treatment they'll do now,
it will be very expensive. Don't worry about the money.
I will talk to your sister today. She will arrange 8-10 lakh rupees. You can borrow the rest from the office. The office is not giving it.  They say... that my job is new, and I've only
been here a few days, so they... can't lend such a large amount on loan. If I have to sell myself to get the money,
I will do that, but... I don't even have a buyer for myself.
What should I do? Don't say such things. Don't lose hope. These trials will end. If you lose hope, so who will give Mehru the strength? Son, pray that she survives. The way she has fought
against a disease like cancer... God will show mercy on us. I hope that God grants us a miracle. Oh my God.  Have mercy on us. God, have mercy on us. is the packing done? es, yes, I will pack my stuff
once yous is done. Listen, do you want to take this shirt
with you? Yes, keep it.  But listen, do remember
to keep my purple tie and joggers. I've kept it. And by the way,
I checked the weather forecast, and it's going to be very cold there. So bring warm clothes for both of us. I also checked.  I've kept them too. What's going on?  You seem very happy today. Not just happy, I'm excited too. I mean, look, we're going abroad together
for the first time after our wedding. I know I sound silly, but it feels
as if we're newly married. - As if we're going on a honeymoon.
- So I think it's like that. Imagine if we're going on a honeymoon. You know what I want, Rameen? I want this trip to be very memorable
for me. I want the two of to spend time together,
without involving a third person. Who's the third person?
It's just the two of us. There is stress about home, about work,
about business. We have to leave everything here. Freeing our mind of everything. And most importantly, I want... you to not be depressed
about your home issues. I promise.  Nothing like that is
going to happen.  Solid promise. -Solid?
-Solid! Listen, did you tell Uncle we're leaving? No, I didn't tell him yet.  -But I'll be on the breakfast table.
-Shahzar, man! Come on, man.  I'm helping you pack
and you're not even appreciating me. You're doing me such a huge favor! First, you told me to speak respectfully,
but where are my clothes? You didn't make tea for me, and it
feels like you don't care about me. Forget it!  Man, you know I'm quick
tempered.  I just stupid things like these. I was just teasing you. I know.  Before we start fighting again,
I'm going to the breakfast table.  Come. Okay. You! Idiot. Salam, Uncle. How are you? What happened, Uncle? Is... is everything okay? What? Uncle, how is this possible? Are you sure the reports are... Are the reports correct? Oh my God. Uncle, you don't worry.  I'm... I'm coming. Yes, yes.  I'll bring Rameen along with me. Yes. Dado, why didn't anyone tell me
about this? My dear, I told them not to. You were already so disturbed. I didn't want to bother you anymore. You've gotten married now.
You should focus on your husband. What does being married mean?
Is my relationship over with both of you? Huh? You know there's no one in the world-- You
know how important you both are in my life. What are the doctors saying? Which hospital is the
treatment taking place at? It is a government hospital close by. Government hospital? Why didn't you take her
to a private hospital? Look, I-- Please, I want to say something. Please take her to a good hospital.
I will take care of all the expenses. In fact, mom also said to send you this
message: Don't worry about the money. Uncle, please give me her file.
I'll take her to a good doctor. Dear... whether it is a government or private
hospital, the treatment will be the same. And I hate you and your mom saying
that isn't feasible. We are the girl's family, we can't even afford the water-- These are old ways of thinking.
Please, don't think like that. Besides, you told me that I am your son,
not just your son-in-law. Let me fulfill
the responsibility of being your son. That's it, Mama.  Everything will be fine.
I'm here, I'll take care of everything now. You're not here.  My dear, go home and
pack.  You have to go to Turkey tomorrow. Are you going to go with that worried face? what are you talking about?  I'm going to
go on vacations, are you leaving like this? No, Rameen. Umar, Shahzar, please talk to her. She has gone mad. You don't have to change the plan
because of me, dear. Rameen is absolutely right. We can postpone the Turkey trip
until you are better. -Once you get better, we'll go.  Simple.
- Exactly. It's as simple as that. No. Yes, how is the health of our mother-in-law? This is not good.
Her condition is very critical. Obviously the cancer is in the last stage. There is no chance of survival,
only a miracle can save her. I don't understand
why they won't take her abroad. We'll foot the bill, we'll take her,
consult a good specialist. No, I've offered to take her
to a specialist, but they're refusing. They are self-respecting people. They say they will pay
for any treatment themselves. Rameen didn't come back with you? She will stay with her mother today. What about Turkey? Obviously the plan is cancelled. Oh. It was a good plan. Everything is solved by itself.
I don't have to do anything. This is a very good news! That's why their trip is cancelled. You are right.  We don't have to
worry anymore. Thank God it got cancelled. But did you see how off Shahzar's mood was? Of course. I don't understand what's happening.
He's slipping out of my hands. Just imagine.  At breakfast,
I was informed that they were going! He never did anything without my
permission before.  He didn't even breathe. But now, all the planning is done
without telling me, he didn't even ask me. -Oh, Mamu is calling from Dubai.
- From Dubai? I sent him for some work.  Hello. Yes, what's the update? Okay, that's right.  No, no, no.
No one should get involved in this. Don't tell anyone, not even the police.
When is he arriving? Oh, you'll get your prize.
Of course you will.  A big prize. All right. Okay.  Goodbye. We know about Kamran.
He's coming on Friday at 11 pm. Really? Oh, don't involve the police there. Tell Qayyum to send his people
to pick him up. Make sure to get the divorce
papers signed immediately so that Manal's life can be saved. Let me just get a hold of him! My dear, go home and pack;
you have to leave for Turkey tomorrow. What are you saying?  How can I go on a vacation, leaving you
like this? How could you be so
careless in my matter, Rameen? You cancelled the plan so easily. You didn't even take
the time to consult me. I was so excited about this vacation. I thought we'd have
such a good time together. I thought you loved me, but today
you've shattered this false illusion. You only care about your family. You only love them. It feels like I don't
even exist in your life. I hope I didn't disturb you. Khala said you crave coffee at this time. Rameen isn't at home. So I thought I... should make coffee for my handsome cousin. You've gone out of your way for no reason. My advice would be not to bother
with this from now on. Rameen always makes coffee for me,
and I only like the coffee she makes. You can forget about that. I mean, her mother is unwell,
she can't leave her. By the way... I've been thinking about something lately. What? As much as you love Rameen... she doesn't love you even
20% as much as you love her. I know this might upset you,
but it's the truth. She loves her parents
more than she loves you. Didn't you notice? Since she moved into
this house after marriage, the happiness and affection
on her face are gone. This is not what I’m saying,
but the elders say... that women who are tangled
in their family issues... they cannot care for their in-laws... or their husbands. Thanks. Thank you for the coffee. Please go inside. Okay, here it is. If you need anything, I'll be up. Yes, all right. Yes, all right. You didn't tell us she's a cancer patient. The tumor has been removed, but the cancer
has spread throughout her body. What did the doctors say?
Will Mehru survive? The doctors have given up. Take her to a good hospital
so she can get treated in time. However, they might suggest surgery
right away.  So, please mentally prepare for that. The doctors say there’s
no point in treating her now.  Any treatment will be very expensive.  If I have to sell myself, I will.
But no one is willing to buy me either. What should I do? he cancer has spread throughout
her body, and it’s difficult to control. But with timely treatment and prayer,
it can be managed.  Pray for her that she survives.  Just like she fought cancer,
God will have mercy on us.
