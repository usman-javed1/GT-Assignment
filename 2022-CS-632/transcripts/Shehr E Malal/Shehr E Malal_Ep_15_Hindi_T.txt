[14.20] - Do you talk to Kamran?
- Kamran who?
[17.52] Oh, the one who's in love with you. 
Who else?
[20.41] That cheapster? Loser?
[22.59] So what? Talk to him.
Meet him once or twice.
[25.38] Fine, he's the owner of the company.
[27.57] But I've established everything for him.
[31.01] He didn't earn a single penny 
with his own efforts.
[87.81] Amma, today I saw Minal with a guy
in a car.
[92.75] So you didn't ask who that guy was?
[96.11] I did.
[98.12] I think Minal is involved with him.
And she told me he has proposed to her too.
[103.96] Okay.
[112.28] But who is the guy? What does he do?
What's the family like?
[116.73] I don't know too much, but Minal has met
him recently. It hasn't been a lot of time.
[122.53] Maria has met him though. 
She said he's smart, good looking.
[126.16] It seems as if he belongs to a good family.
[128.17] So it means it's been a few days
since she met him,
[130.28] and Minal has already decided to marry him.
[133.12] And she has also issued a certificate
of him being a good person! Wow!
[136.98] This is why I used to say to keep an eye 
on the girl.
[139.15] Don't let her go out on her own.
But... but you?
[142.52] Shahnawaz.
[144.72] Tabinda doesn't have any fault 
in any of this.
[147.82] I told Minal to learn how to drive,
to go out on her own.
[152.27] Look, we can't restrict our girls too much
in the society that we belonged to.
[159.19] And love marriage is a fashion now.
[161.33] You're right. It's very common these days.
[163.85] Now that Shahzar has
married of his own accord,
[166.27] Minal is set to follow in his footsteps.
[170.63] But...
[172.66] who is the guy? What's his family like?
[178.56] I... don't know a lot. Just that...
[181.80] his parents passed away in a car accident 
some 20-25 years ago.
[186.20] They had a nice business,
he's an only child.
[190.82] Have you heard of  Shah Motors?
[195.19] Oh, really?
[197.06] Shah Motors?
[199.27] The ones who import cars from abroad?
That on?
[202.25] The same.
[205.54] Yes.
[208.08] I knew Mr. Zafar.
[211.23] He was a big businessman
and had a solid reputation in the city.
[217.56] You're right. He passed away
in a car accident 25 years ago.
[223.50] His son is handling everything, 
looking after the business too.
[227.85] So you know them?
[230.22] Yes, I knew them.
But I've never met Kamran.
[235.35] I've heard he's doing very good work,
he's also well-off himself.
[239.85] And he also a very good reputation.
[242.31] He's 30 years old, touch wood,
but he hasn't gotten married yet.
[246.31] Look, we can inquire about he guy.
[249.96] We'll fine out about his
family background too,
[251.90] but it's better to meet him
and see how the guy is.
[255.36] I knew Minal's choice wouldn't be bad.
[259.06] We should meet and see.
[261.51] Okay, tell Minal to invite him over for
dinner tomorrow night, I want to meet him.
[275.88] Minal...
[278.00] My dear, how could you decide he’s the
one after just meeting him a few times?
[283.94] Phuppo, you can figure it out in one
meeting too, can't you? And am I a child?
[288.60] I go to the university.
I meet new people everyday.
[292.37] And Kamran isn't lacking in anything.
[294.26] Except that he doesn't have anyone.
No parents.
[298.16] But, dear, still. There's some--
[300.73] Whether you decide after
careful thought or impulsively,
[304.29] what's meant to be will happen eventually.
[307.19] So even if you find a guy for
me after thorough investigation,
[310.36] what's the guarantee
that he'll keep me happy?
[314.04] You have to take a risk in marriage
because there are no guarantees.
[317.78] Child, it's not good 
to be so over-confident.
[320.47] Tabinda, you should talk to her.
[322.40] What should I tell her? She's a grown up.
She can make her own decisions.
[327.01] I'm sure whoever she has liked
is a good guy.
[331.31] She's intelligent. You don't worry.
[334.23] See! You worry needlessly.
She still thinks of me as a kid.
[338.67] You'll always be a kid for her,
and for me too.
[342.05] I'm always concerned about her.
[344.19] Okay, enough. Enough!
Stop worrying about me.
[349.24] Thank God, Mom.
Finally this rat girl has liked a guy.
[352.35] She had 50 proposals
but she always had some objections.
[356.41] The guy is short, he's overweight.
He's cross eyes and God knows what else!
[361.61] Absolutely not, Bhai.
You're just over exaggerating.
[364.08] Really!
[365.28] No, no. Not 50. She had a 100 proposals.
[369.19] Madam doesn't like anyone.
We'll see which weirdo she has liked.
[373.81] Mom, don't call him a weirdo, and Bhai?
Don't be jealous.
[377.68] I haven't liked some ordinary guy.
You'll be start struck when you see him!
[381.61] Mom, I think it's a good opportunity.
Quickly invite that guy,
[384.64] fix her proposal 
and send her away from here.
[387.64] I know you want me to leave this house 
as soon as possible.
[390.47] Not as soon as possible.
[391.88] I want you to leave this house today.
[395.10] I'm your only sister
and you want me to leave this house?
[398.30] Yes! I'm joking, I'm just kidding.
Why do you take everything so seriously?
[403.05] Look, it's a technical thing. You'll have
to understand it. You'll leave this home,
[406.78] so I'll have all of Mom's and Dad's
attention. My importance will increase!
[411.38] You're still the favorite child.
Mom gives you the most importance.
[416.35] No.
[417.83] Everyone is the same for the parents.
[419.71] Did you see, Mom? I told you.
She's jealous of me.
[423.25] No way! Me? Jealous of you?
It's impossible. You'll miss this shot.
[429.01] See?
[431.51] You see how bad her gaze is?
[434.59] Sir, apart from this,
we have other varieties of sports cars.
[438.13] We'll imported if from Germany 
in the last few days.
[440.48] Sir, it's a brand new model.
[442.23] If you want, 
we can schedule a visit for you.
[445.24] Yes, sir.
[447.06] Yes.
[448.94] Sir, Mr. Shah is calling you.
[451.29] Tell him I'm coming.
[453.26] Okay, sir, I'll wait for you.
[455.17] Thank you. Thank you so much.
[462.53] - Sir, may I come in?
- Oh, Kamran. Come in.
[467.88] Sir, you called me?
[472.53] There are some complaints 
from the customers.
[476.44] Complaints?
[478.83] Sir, I don't understand.
What kind of complaints?
[482.31] It has come into my notice
[483.43] that some people from the sales department
aren't working properly.
[487.88] They're roaming around in my absence.
[490.68] And I've especially heard it about you
[493.17] that you take some customers' cars
and go out during working hours.
[498.47] No, no, no, sir. It's not like that at all.
[502.03] Sure, sir, I've gone out once or twice
but because the client asked me.
[506.13] I took their cars for maintenance.
[508.48] Sir, you know me, right?
[510.60] I'm loyal to you.
[512.31] Sir, tell me yourself.
[513.86] In these 2 years, have you ever heard
any complaints about me?
[517.63] No, sir. Right?
[519.13] This is why I was thinking to hand over
everything to you before my visit to Japan.
[524.52] But after hearing all these complaints 
about you, I'm thinking...
[527.48] Oh, no, Sir. You go 
without worrying about anything.
[530.29] I'll handle your entire business,
[531.90] in fact, I'll look after your house 
and your farmhouse too.
[535.59] Okay, fine.
[536.74] Do one thing then, keep the keys to my
Clifton apartment and farm house with you.
[541.28] And keep visiting them during my absence.
[544.80] And yes, I've sent all the servants
for a month long vacation.
[548.84] All right, sir, of course. 
By the way, sir...
[552.48] when will you be back?
[555.25] I'll be back in a month or 2.
[562.03] Hello?
[565.64] Yes, I've seen the car. It's nice.
[569.16] Anyway, I'm going to Japan.
I'll be back in a month or so.
[573.24] In my absence, 
Kamran will look after everything.
[575.63] Okay.
[578.74] He's going to Japan for a month.
[581.97] His home...
[583.65] his penthouse, and his farm house...
[587.72] he's handing everything over to me.
[590.94] Everything's under my control now.
[593.12] Very good!
[594.75] Everything is going according to our plan.
[598.29] You have to be very careful and very smart.
Do you understand me?
[601.74] No one should doubt you that you're
Kamran Ahmed instead of Kamran Shah.
[606.66] Just an ordinary manager at this company.
[609.58] Not ordinary. Very special.
[613.55] Anyway, forget about it.
[615.30] Minal called.
[617.12] Her parents wants to meet me
as soon as possible.
[620.87] They've invited me
over for dinner tomorrow.
[623.52] It's possible they'll set the date 
for the wedding too.
[628.81] That's what I feel too.
[630.85] Do one thing, before you meet them,
meet me.
[634.64] Minal's parents have some reservations.
[638.66] In fact, I want to tell you 
what you should say to them. All right?
[644.09] Meet me first.
[646.98] All right.
[648.91] I'll meet you.
[653.82] What do you mean Mama's at work?
[658.13] Didn't she tell you about her job?
[660.84] I talk to her almost daily, she
didn't say a word about any job.
[666.24] Child, I didn't know she was hiding it 
from you.
[670.41] It's been one week
since she started working.
[672.53] And you've also come 
after a very long time.
[676.18] So how did you and Baba allow this 
to happen?
[678.74] Both of you are well aware
of her condition.
[681.20] Child, I told her no. But it's not like
anyone listens to me.
[686.08] You and your mother do as you will.
[687.95] When nobody listens to me,
why should I interrupt?
[692.25] - Where's Baba?
- He's in his room.
[735.66] Baba!
[737.93] You're having Mama do a job?
[740.34] In this condition?
[741.57] You know everything? but still?
[744.61] I don't understand 
how you could be so selfish.
[748.02] Will you keep talking or will you give
me a chance to say something too?
[750.60] What I'm saying is right.
I'm only telling you the reality.
[754.17] You've used her money your entire life
for your own personal use.
[758.51] And when she needs you...
[760.66] you've gotten her a job 
at that third-class factory!
[763.17] I didn't send your mother to work.
[766.28] I asked her not to, I got angry too.
I even begged her.
[769.89] But you know how stubborn your mother is,
she doesn't listen.
[772.50] Yes, of course. I know how stubborn she is,
but I also know you.
[776.11] You must've told her not to get a job
to fulfill a formality.
[779.59] But you must've thought you're
getting money sitting at home.
[783.23] Because you know what your reputation is,
nobody wants to employ you.
[787.69] Seeing all of this, what other option
did she have instead of working?
[791.84] Thank God I didn't say no
to marrying Shahzar for you.
[795.75] I don't know what your issue is
with his parents.
[798.41] They're offering you highly coveted
position, but you're not agreeing.
[804.41] Who filled your head with so much poison
against me?
[807.63] Why are you so disgusted of me?
[811.18] I didn't commit a sin.
[814.12] I didn't ruin your grandfather's business.
[817.74] I didn't use his money for anything wrong.
[822.86] I don't believe you, I'm sorry.
[826.59] How can I begrudge the world
when my own daughter wouldn't trust me?
[831.21] Baba, after everything that's happened,
[833.54] I'm sorry, but you don't hold
the same position in my life anymore.
[838.93] Specially after what you've done with Mom.
[843.10] After today, I won't call you Baba
and I won't come to this house either.
[848.27] De--
[867.68] I'm sorry, but you don't hold
the same position in my life anymore.
[871.73] After today, I won't call you Baba
and I won't come to this house either.
[879.58] Yes, it was nice to meet that guy. 
He's nice. Very decent and sensible.
[883.65] And he matches us in status, and
most of all, his family is also very good.
[889.33] Whatever may be, Shahnawaz,
[891.94] I don't like that all of this is happening
so quickly.
[895.28] No, no. We'll do a thorough research.
[897.50] I think we should complete our inquiry
as soon as possible.
[901.17] It'll be better.
[902.21] I'm just happy about one thing.
[904.07] That he's independent, alone.
There's no family or anything.
[907.24] Him being alone is what's bothering me.
[910.65] What are people going to say?
We've given our girl to an orphan.
[913.95] There's no one in his family.
[915.43] If he doesn't have parents, 
he could've brought someone else with him.
[917.67] Chacha, Taya, Mamu, is there no one
that he came alone?
[921.38] Yes, I didn't understand it either.
[924.23] Oh, he told us why his family cut him off, 
right?
[929.12] They've set their eyes on his wealth,
[930.83] they want to make him their
son-in-law so he's cut them off.
[935.88] Look, if the girl isn't happy 
at her in-laws,
[938.85] if there's no inner peace,
so all this money, wealth, status,
[942.96] none of it matters, it's all useless.
[945.43] What do you people want?
[946.71] I only want what Minal wants.
I want her happiness.
[950.77] Did you see how Rameen attempted 
suicide for Shahzar?
[954.06] Things got so out of hand,
we had to face so much humiliation.
[956.92] I don't want Minal to take any such step, 
God forbid.
[960.00] I won't be able to tolerate it.
[962.13] I just want Minal to make
whatever decision she wants,
[966.01] anything that makes her happy 
makes me happy too.
[988.87] Oh, my God! Minal!
[991.05] Evil eyes off! You looked so pretty.
[995.49] You're so lucky! You're getting married
in such a nice family.
[999.93] You looked very pretty today.
[1003.20] Man...
[1004.38] such men are fated to be with rich girls
like you.
[1011.35] A middle class girl like isn't even
fated to be with a middle class man.
[1021.09] Why are you saying that?
[1023.16] Let me just get married,
[1024.93] I'll find a proposal for you myself.
That too very high class.
[1029.04] Thank you so much! You're so nice.
[1031.33] You're the only one in this house
who understand my pain and value me.
[1037.09] Otherwise your Bhabi and Khala
don't even talk to me.
[1043.47] You saying this is enough for me.
[1047.35] Yeah, even I don't get to talk
to Bhabi anymore.
[1054.48] Sometime back...
[1056.62] weren't you very attached to her?
[1060.65] Yes, but I stepped back 
after her cold responses.
[1064.74] God knows what she's so arrogant about.
[1069.80] Anyway...
[1072.12] I'm feeling very nervous.
How is the family going to respond?
[1076.10] Oh, you don't worry at all.
[1077.90] I've just heard it. Everyone's very happy,
everyone liked him a lot.
[1081.24] And why wouldn't they? 
This is the kind of proposal Khala wanted.
[1084.85] Someone who lives alone
and has a high status.
[1088.70] Just be mindful of your dad and phuppo.
[1092.77] They might object to him living alone.
[1095.81] Don't worry about anyone else.
[1097.24] Just get them to agree, 
everything else is fine.
[1102.14] Shahnawaz is absolutely right.
[1104.31] Why is Kamran insisting to get married
so quickly?
[1107.09] Even I don't understand this.
[1109.69] We have to be very careful
with daughters' marriages.
[1113.12] You should inquire about this guy too.
[1116.35] Oh, Amma, why are you getting worried?
[1117.79] For your peace of mind, I've inquired
about him. The reports are good.
[1123.31] He belongs to a good, well-reputed family.
[1126.45] He's the only heir. He's very wealthy too.
I think Minal will be very happy with him.
[1132.19] You're right.
[1134.30] But I can't seem to be at peace
with this proposal.
[1136.83] Wedding in a month? How is this possible?
[1140.61] What do you need for a wedding?
[1142.40] What do you need for preparations? 
Money, right?
[1145.38] Look, neither side is lacking.
Everything will be fine.
[1149.21] You don't worry. We'll send off Minal
with a grand celebration.
[1152.67] Tell me though, who's going to
come in barat from Kamran's side?
[1157.69] He doesn't have any siblings.
[1159.42] I've heard he has boycotted his family too.
[1162.98] Then how is his mehndi and wedding
going to take place?
[1166.65] What can we do now? We'll have one event, 
a very big grand reception.
[1171.47] What?
[1172.65] Just one grand function? That's it?
[1175.88] What's wrong with you?
She's your only daughter.
[1179.37] Amma, honestly...
[1181.70] I'm happy with whatever makes Minal happy,
it's that simple.
[1184.77] I'll do as she says. That's it.
[1189.68] All right, it's up to you.
[1199.02] Thank God...
[1200.95] that your parents agreed
to this wedding.
[1204.54] Otherwise I was very scared that...
[1207.23] the way they were investigating me...
[1211.75] I was unable to understand anything.
[1214.92] I don't why, but I feel that...
[1217.47] they're very opposed to my living alone.
[1220.44] You won't be living alone anymore.
[1222.60] I'm coming into your life forever.
[1224.96] You have no idea how impatient I was
to marry you.
[1229.81] You can't even imagine...
[1232.36] how happy I'll make you 
after we're married.
[1235.50] All of life's luxuries...
[1238.28] I'll bring them to your feet.
[1243.24] Marrying me...
[1245.64] won't ever be a matter of regret for you.
[1249.25] I know.
[1251.03] I trust you.
[1252.37] Although your dad and phuppo
don't seem too excited about our marriage.
[1258.42] - What if they try to stop our wedding?
- Dad?
[1264.12] Dad has an old habit of getting
caught up in worries and doubts.
[1267.76] As for Phuppo, she'll be happy
with whatever makes me happy.
[1272.37] By the way, Mom and Bhai were very happy
to meet you.
[1276.48] In fact, ever since Mom has met you,
she's not tiring of praising you.
[1281.49] She's really happy with this marriage.
[1283.74] Forget about her.
[1285.73] You tell me. How happy are you
with this marriage?
[1290.41] I'm very happy.
[1293.28] I'm so happy that I can't even express it.
[1298.30] I never thought that a guy like you
would come into my life.
[1305.00] And you know...
[1307.24] I wanted my life partner exactly 
as you are.
[1313.04] You just make me happy.
[1317.33] And I don't know how to explain that.
[1321.11] Thank you for being a part of my life.
[1325.24] How can Mr. Shahnawaz agree to this? He's
marrying his daughter to an ungrounded guy.
[1330.96] It's shocking.
[1335.06] The only thing missing is that he is alone
and orphaned.
[1338.97] What else is he lacking otherwise?
[1342.71] Tabinda has found a very rich party
for her daughter.
[1346.55] A greedy woman like her would
want a rich guy who's alone.
[1351.67] Rameen was telling me he has a business
worth billions and he's worth millions too.
[1358.38] Amma, speaking of Rameen...
[1364.07] I've called her so many times,
she doesn't answer.
[1368.22] She hasn't replied to my messages either.
[1372.24] Maybe she...
[1375.34] is upset with me.
[1376.90] Not maybe, she's definitely upset with you.
[1380.19] She doesn't like you doing
this ordinary job at the factory.
[1384.70] Not just her, Umar and I
don't like you working either.
[1388.68] Quit this job as soon as you can.
[1416.13] Here, here. Quickly take this.
My hand is burning.
[1419.02] - Be careful.
- Oh, my--
[1420.95] Your coffee and my tea.
[1424.02] Thank you so much. You should've told me,
I would've made it.
[1426.92] No, you're working.
I thought I'd make tea today.
[1430.75] I'm not working, I'm stuck.
[1433.34] What? What are you doing?
[1437.46] Actually, I have to make a flow chart for
profit productivity. I don't know how to!
[1441.85] I never learned power point presentation.
[1444.49] Show me.
[1445.95] - What is all this?
- This is all the profit--
[1448.65] Oh, this is a total production chart. Okay.
Take this and tell me all these figures.
[1453.15] And-- In fact, do this. Come here, 
I'll teach you.
[1455.64] - Yes.
- Here, we transferred the file.
[1458.46] Here, we clicked on the new file
and added the data...
[1485.94] Find out...
[1488.21] what are they giving Minal in her dowry.
[1492.03] Oh, they're giving her shares
in the property and the business.
[1495.49] And I've heard her phuppo say
that she has a share in this house too.
[1500.47] This house is worth 18 corore 
and the business is worth billions!
[1504.18] What am I going to do with all of this?
[1506.55] Look, I don't want all of this.
[1508.94] You must find a way to tell them 
to give cash and jewelry to Minal.
[1515.06] No, man, no. I can't do that.
[1517.00] You should tell it 
to your wife-to-be yourself.
[1521.71] In fact, tell them that you
don't want anything in dowry.
[1527.21] Really? And what if they
actually sent Minal empty handed?
[1531.64] Oh, they're very cultured people
and she's their only daughter.
[1534.35] They'll never do that.
They won't send her empty handed.
[1536.99] No, man, no.
[1538.88] I can't take such a big risk.
[1541.74] And you know I have to reach Dubai
in one month, right?
[1546.31] I've seen a property there
and I've promised to pay 5 corore too!
[1550.45] Look, I'll divorce Minal
as soon as we're married.
[1554.53] I know. I know everything about your plan.
[1556.73] But use your head and don't be so hasty
with everything.
[1559.11] You've already made them suspicious
by asking for a simple wedding.
[1562.36] I don't have any other option
except for a simple marriage.
[1566.26] Where will I get fake relatives and
millions of rupees for a grand function?
[1572.18] We'll find a solution for this too.
[1575.87] Where so many lies have been told,
creating 3-4 relatives is no big deal.
[1582.29] Let me tell you something though.
[1584.13] This old man, Shahnawaz, he doesn't
seem very happy with the wedding.
[1589.14] I'm telling you. In order to impress him,
you must tell him you don't want any dowry.
[1597.59] Just keep doing as I say,
then you'll see the results.
[1604.88] Anyway, tell me...
[1608.00] have you arranged for jewelry 
and everything else?
[1642.99] How will I arrange so much money?
I don't get it.
[1651.90] - You're here.
- Here you go, man.
[1658.31] It's a check for 25 lakh.
[1660.73] Take your fiancee for a shopping trip
of her dreams.
[1663.27] What is this?
[1664.95] Just 25 lakh?
[1667.08] Man, they're a big party.
[1670.08] The total budget for the wedding
is 40 lakhs.
[1672.65] Look, man, try to understand.
I need complete 50 lakh.
[1680.96] Why are you looking at me like that?
[1682.22] I've told you I'll return everything
with interest before I go to Dubai!
[1688.07] Okay, fine.
[1690.08] Tomorrow morning, I'll give you a check
worth 50 lakh.
[1694.44] But remember your promise. 
I'll take it all back with interest.
[1702.19] Why are you worried, my friend?
[1704.68] Minal's father has promised 
to give 3 corore.
[1709.74] I'll transfer everything to my account
on the wedding night.
[1713.88] But how are you going  to do all of this?
[1716.58] I mean...
[1718.88] how can you just transfer like that?
[1723.01] That's the problem, man!
[1725.68] How am I going to do all of this, 
topped with the wedding expenses.
[1730.14] There are jewelry expenses.
[1731.85] - I don't know how this will be done.
- I have a plan.
[1734.38] Why?
[1735.81] My uncle's son owns a jewelry shop.
[1739.47] He has a huge business of diamond 
and gold.
[1742.90] We can rent the jewelry for two days.
[1747.04] In fact, I can get a fake diamond set
made for you.
[1752.89] No, man. No, no, no.
[1754.36] This is all useless. They're rich people!
[1757.86] They're from a well reputed family.
[1759.28] They'll recognize it immediately
and I can't take such a big risk.
[1762.27] Our entire plan will be ruined 
if we get caught.
[1764.23] Okay, don't worry. 
I'll arrange a diamond set for you.
[1768.84] You can thank me later.
[1770.68] - What a friend you have!
- What a lovely friend you are!
[1774.14] Tell me something though.
[1776.06] You're an amazing man.
You have a solution for everything.
[1779.62] After all, I'm your friend.
[1836.18] Umar.
[1838.21] It's so late and you've not slept yet.
[1842.00] I couldn't sleep.
[1850.61] What are you thinking about?
[1855.85] You wake up early in the morning.
[1858.95] You finish all the house chores,
then you go to your office.
[1862.05] You work there all day 
and when you come back all tired...
[1866.88] then you start house chores 
all over again.
[1871.58] All of this stress isn't good for you.
[1875.71] I can't sleep at night because of this.
[1878.37] Whenever I think about it, I...
[1881.44] - I feel like killing myself sometimes.
- What are you saying?
[1885.41] Control yourself, Umar.
[1887.40] You acting like this stresses me out.
[1890.60] I'm not doing anything unusual.
A lot of women do this.
[1894.58] And circumstances don't always 
remain the same.
[1898.69] You weren't jobless your whole life.
[1901.63] Just have a little patience.
[1904.74] And take such thoughts out of your head.
[1909.79] I don't mind being patient.
I've been patient my whole life.
[1915.45] But I don't know how long 
I can be patient for.
[1921.19] I'm worried about you.
[1925.13] You've supported me my whole life.
[1930.32] You never left me alone.
[1933.19] But seeing you in this condition, 
seeing you work, I don't like it.
[1939.19] Look here.
[1941.53] I'm completely fine and happy.
[1945.72] You're my strength.
[1948.43] You can't become weak.
[1951.34] I have full faith...
[1954.18] that God must've something good 
in store for us.
[1973.26] Since when have you two been
having these misunderstandings?
[1977.43] And you never shared it with us.
[1980.81] If Shahzar says anything wrong now,
[1983.25] I'll go to your mother-in-law
and complain to her.
[1986.19] Dado, there’s no use in doing all of this.
And please, don’t say anything to auntie.
[1991.56] Because it's not her fault.
[1993.43] She's always taking my side anyway.
She keeps scolding Shahzar.
[1998.10] Dado, you know I was slow
to understand her. I was wrong.
[2002.42] Her words may be harsh, 
but her heart is very kind.
[2006.18] But what has happened to Shahzar?
[2008.72] Why is he so wary of you?
[2013.05] I don't know, Dado.
[2015.37] He's at the office all the time,
he comes home so late.
[2020.00] We can't spend any time together.
[2022.71] And the time we do get, 
he's always fighting me.
[2026.99] Everything that he used to like about me...
[2031.07] he dislikes them all now.
[2033.66] It's possible that he's very busy, dear.
[2038.09] That's why he's unable to give you time
and you're misunderstanding him.
[2041.24] No, Dado.
[2043.39] I don't have any misunderstandings 
this time.
[2046.62] He has... he has actually changed.
Specially since Baba said no to that job.
[2052.01] I think he got offended.
[2054.06] He behavior has become even more harsh
since then.
[2058.15] Anyway, you forget about it.
Tell me, how are you?
[2061.86] I'm fine, dear. What can happen to me?
[2065.13] But eve since you misbehaved with Umar...
[2070.02] both of your parents
have become very worried.
[2073.25] You should come 
and apologize for your behavior.
[2076.86] Dado, I won't apologize to them
because I'm right.
[2080.50] And Mama also told me that
I can't come there anymore.
[2083.22] And I won't come there until Baba resigns
from that job.
[2086.87] You're just like your mother.
[2090.65] Dado, I'm right. 
And I'm not being stubborn.
[2094.73] What can I say, dear? I've gotten
more worried after talking to you.
[2099.14] I'll pray to God that everything is well.
[2224.96] Khala, can I give you an advice though?
[2226.55] Transfer all the money you were going
to spend on her wedding into her account.
[2230.71] You mind your business. 
I know what I have to do.
[2234.38] Go inside and do something.
[2236.36] So it means everything is going
according to plan?
[2239.03] What do you think of your friend?
[2241.52] I've woven such a web 
that the whole family is now tangled in it.
[2246.16] Kamran, you have no idea how excited I am
to go to Dubai.
