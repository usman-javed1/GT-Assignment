[112.24] upset He wanted to forgive Kamran and bring him to this house and
[115.24] because of my refusal he got very
[118.72] upset He
[121.00] wanted my home to be settled in his life He could
[124.00] not bear my tears
[127.48] but Kamran's  When Mom refused because of his attitude, I became
[131.12] very angry and the situation became bad
[137.79] [Sangeet]
[141.36] I
[143.48] always used to tell Shahnawaz not to get
[147.00] angry,
[150.92] but it's okay
[153.08] [Sangeet]
[155.40] Suta, you take me to Dad, I want to talk to Dad
[160.45] [Sangeet]
[162.36] what will you talk about, I will
[167.80] tell Dad that I have forgiven Kamran
[173.88] and I don't mind him staying in this house, I will take
[181.04] me to Dad,
[184.64] okay, okay,
[189.52] but don't be worried, Inshallah, see,
[192.60] son, everything will be fine,
[194.80] my
[202.16] daughter, you don't need to be so worried about Dad,
[205.00] I am thinking of
[207.96] hiring a male attendant, it's work, you won't be
[210.88] able to do it, no, there is no need for it, I am here, I
[213.24] 'm my wife, I ca
[217.04] n't leave him to the nurses and employees like this, I will take care of
[222.92] him myself, but having a male attendant to help you is
[225.28] very important
[227.69] [Sangeet]
[229.44] because you have a lot of other responsibilities on your shoulders,
[234.20] right, okay
[237.49] [Sangeet]
[248.80] Kamran is also coming, if I have to
[252.28] go to the office for an hour or two, then he will take care of me
[255.40] Shahnawaz will see what are
[258.60] you saying
[261.88] Kamran will stay in this house as a son in law Will you take care of your father in law
[269.96] Now that he is coming start apologizing for your mistakes
[272.17] [Music]
[288.60] No I will ruin you completely
[292.36] You can never be happy after deceiving me so big
[300.35] [Music]
[304.80] My name is Maria I will not let you play any tricks now
[310.91] [Music] I will expose
[313.84] your real face in front of everyone very
[321.92] soon What can I say about this
[324.44] Obviously he is his biological child It is
[327.88] his right to decide his life
[331.52] But as far as Kamran is concerned his
[336.12] coming is also very irritating to me So what can I do I am
[343.40] not worried about that Kamran I will
[347.56] take care of him
[352.92] actually I am worried about dad
[357.52] Suddenly his becoming weak I do
[361.08] n't understand anything
[364.56] Shaz this is the first time I have seen you so worried for your dad
[369.18] [Music]
[372.20] Why am I not his son
[374.96] Do I not love him
[377.77] [Music]
[379.04] But you always ignored your mother more than your father
[383.20] and that too sly mother
[387.40] You both are very attached as mother and
[392.08] son
[396.92] but I don't know why I feel as if
[399.44] she loves you
[402.56] but now this misunderstanding has also been cleared
[406.88] but
[409.48] I am very worried for your father on your behalf
[413.05] [sangeet] I
[415.76] agree
[418.52] that Shahnawaz's
[420.92] anger and irritability is more due to old age
[427.68] but a woman like Tab could have handled it
[436.00] Shajar, where are you lost, I am talking to you, I want to tell
[446.52] you something important for a long time
[450.22] [sangeet] I do
[459.80] n't know how to say it
[464.76] but
[467.08] mom's
[468.72] activity Jajar, the police arrested Umar Hasan, is it a
[473.68] gun case
[480.74] [sangeet]
[505.28] who is it, come, if
[512.84] someone sees you here then you know
[515.80] how big a mess it will be, I am
[518.04] not afraid of anyone, be thankful to yourself,
[524.04] why are you trying to ruin my peace,
[526.92] I am not doing all this for myself, I am doing it
[529.52] for you too and once the
[532.84] property of Mal is in my name, then
[534.72] stop talking nonsense
[536.44] or fooling girls like Manal by talking sweetly,
[539.88] you don't know me,
[543.08] my name is Maria and you know very well
[545.56] that I am
[554.60] much bigger than you, I am with you  I made a mistake,
[558.48] Mara. Look, I am still suffering the consequences of this stupidity. I
[561.16] love you very much.
[565.03] [Music]
[567.76] Please,
[571.16] I am not Manal. You fool girls like Manal
[575.80] and girls like her,
[578.12] forgive
[581.60] me. I am the one because of whom you are
[586.40] standing here. I am the one who brought you here
[589.44] and you have forgotten me.
[593.04] You had promised me that after
[596.48] settling down in Dubai, you will call me first,
[600.16] but you did not do so. You turned your eyes away from me, you
[603.32] cheated me. You are very nice
[607.56] Kamran. You have forgotten me. It is not like that. I admit that
[612.32] I made a mistake. Look, Mara,
[616.24] for whom did I come to Pakistan? For both of us,
[619.00] so that you can take me from here.
[621.24] I am very hurt. Call this
[626.36] nonsense. I am not going to fall for any useless lie.
[631.88] This is the status of people like you.
[635.80] You people do not get respect and wealth.
[638.72] Hey, please, please forgive
[641.04] me. I
[644.08] still love you very much. I made a
[647.36] mistake. Forgive me. Stop
[650.28] this
[651.20] drama of yours and get out of here as soon as possible.
[656.92] And if I don't go,
[662.08] then I will open your eyes.  I will give it to you
[667.56] [Sangeet]
[669.80] ok then tell me
[672.40] but remember one thing
[674.88] when you tell the truth then
[678.80] you will also get trapped along with him
[680.80] because when they will come to know that
[683.60] you were also a part of my plan then
[687.56] what will happen to you, you do
[695.00] n't know, so please cooperate a little good
[700.24] kids
[703.24] [Sangeet] even if
[709.48] you leave him then will you be able to forget him I wo
[715.00] n't be
[716.84] able to call him but I can't forgive him in my whole life
[721.32] if I get you a divorce from him then will you
[723.96] marry the boy of my choice
[729.04] I don't want to marry anyone so what do you want you will
[732.28] spend your whole life alone
[735.32] what is your age right now
[737.76] what have you seen in this world yet you have
[740.64] no idea a woman has to make a lot of compromises in life
[742.80] so
[745.96] what do you want what should I do forgive me
[749.80] I just want that the mistakes that
[752.52] I have made don't happen to you, don't let
[755.20] such a mistake happen that the stubbornness of not giving him a chance
[758.92] becomes a life long curse for you
[764.64] because love doesn't happen again and again I
[769.44] just want you to think once
[780.55] [Sangeet]
[792.72] Shajar  Shajar ji what are you thinking
[797.40] nothing is right

[818.96] her to meet Umar she will meet her father then her
[823.44] health will get better this is the
[827.00] issue
[831.00] she doesn't even want to see her father's face on
[835.64] top of that her grandmother's health also deteriorated she had a
[840.12] nervous breakdown due to stress I got
[842.04] her admitted in the hospital
[847.44] well how is her health you are
[851.64] saying she is better than before
[854.12] but I am worried that God
[856.72] forbid if something happens to her then Raman will be left
[858.56] all alone
[862.12] you do one thing get her better
[866.28] bring her here me and Amin also

[887.36] yes
[890.04] tell me one thing it was
[892.60] you who got dad married to mom right yes
[895.80] I did the marriage but
[899.56] why are you happy just want to know  I wondered
[903.40] whether Dad was happy with this marriage and and
[907.24] you had done some investigation of Mom and her family
[910.36] etc.
[912.12] Look, I had arranged your Dad's first marriage as well
[915.04] and I had introduced him to that guy as well
[920.96] I didn't know much about the family
[923.48] but it was a middle class family
[929.72] but why are you thinking so much about this
[934.58] [Sangeet] there's
[937.04] one thing I wanted to tell you but I
[941.28] request you not to mention this to anyone
[945.64] if I want to
[948.64] find out something about Mom's background or her family then
[952.36] how can I find out?
[957.32] Yes, they are distant relatives of Mary.
[961.08] Okay,
[963.44] I'll see what to do.
[967.28] What's the matter
[969.88] Shajar, you are hiding something from me. I'll tell you everything when the time comes.
[976.40] You just take care of Dad and
[980.96] especially keep an eye on the attendant who came here for Dad.
[985.00] You know I am very badly entangled in business matters. I ca
[990.04] n't give time to Dad right now.
[992.96] By the way, you have always neglected Shahnawaz
[995.24] and I
[999.08] love Dad very much. You
[1002.32] know and there is no kind of interference in his treatment.  I should
[1004.92] not be negligent, I was thinking of
[1009.88] taking him to the UK for treatment, no, see, his condition is
[1014.76] not such that he should travel such a long distance, what would
[1017.16] you do, we are there to look after him
[1022.25] [Music]
[1069.52] Son, how did you remember me
[1079.00] [Music]
[1085.84] Forgive me [Music]
[1095.40] Today, I have come just to apologise to you
[1098.88] [Music]
[1100.72] Why are you crying [
[1141.41] Music] If not, what else can I do my father, I never respected you, I never gave you your status, I never loved you, I always thought that now you are not only mom's enemy, but also my enemy [Music] I kept
[1146.20] telling you all kinds of bitter things [
[1154.08] Music] I did not understand what you were saying [Music] I understood
[1162.08] dad, you kept explaining to me, you kept persuading me,
[1165.92] but I did not understand
[1194.74] [Music] I wasted all my time, the time when I should have been with you, has passed by [Music]
[1199.92] Now I wish that
[1207.88] somehow that time could come back, when I could
[1210.92] open my heart and show you and tell you
[1212.72] how much I love you  That I
[1222.08] respect you so much That
[1230.88] time will not come back That's why I am
[1236.20] crying
[1246.91] [Sangeet] That's why
[1248.52] time has taught me
[1254.92] everything It has made me understand how wrong I was
[1261.52] Today I am no more here by myself
[1264.21] [Sangeet] I
[1265.96] feel better than
[1273.68] myself Now I understand why all this is
[1276.76] happening
[1280.08] It's true It's a reality
[1283.68] that Mom brought me up But the
[1289.04] reality is also that she
[1290.76] snatched away the most important relationship of my life from me
[1302.12] How did my father go blind while tormenting her
[1305.48] I don't understand anything
[1309.88] And I know, I
[1314.00] know that she is the only one responsible for your condition That's
[1322.12] why I have decided to
[1325.84] bring out her reality in front of everyone
[1330.00] [Sangeet]
[1332.16] That woman did not do it just for money [
[1336.73] Sangeet] There is everything
[1338.44] else There is
[1342.64] something else because of which she is doing all this
[1351.24] I will find out what it is as well Give
[1358.16] me some time
[1362.12] [Sangeet]
[1364.40] Please, you will
[1367.56] see that this son of yours will show you by becoming brave
[1373.54] [Sangeet]
[1375.36] Whatever he has not done before, he will do it now
[1379.51] [Sangeet]
[1383.04] Please forgive me
[1385.96] once Just say that you have forgiven me
[1391.28] Everyone,
[1404.16] forgive me
[1406.82] [Sangeet]
[1409.32] Sorry, I'm really  Sorry, I am very ashamed. No
[1417.92] one will stay in this house. I will make
[1422.00] everything fine.
[1426.40] Just take care of yourself.
[1432.84] [Music]
[1453.92] Your case has been discussed and
[1458.68] if we get proof against Rizwan, it will be very
[1461.76] easy.
[1462.96] Otherwise, in any other case, we will get help from Shajar. I am very
[1470.48] sorry Umar. You had refused me,
[1474.60] but I spoke to your son-in-law
[1478.24] and he is giving a very good response.
[1482.36] He is getting your bail done and also
[1485.08] compensating the loss of Bakar sahab. But
[1487.64] how can you even think that I
[1489.72] can take any help from Shajar? Look, don't act on this emotion.
[1493.32] Understand,
[1496.20] think, the woman whose son he is, this entire case has been
[1500.60] made by that woman. The place where I am
[1503.32] standing today, the mother of that woman has a hand in bringing me here.
[1505.20] And you want
[1507.80] me to take help from her son. He is the son of that woman, so is
[1510.48] your son-in-law. If it was a matter of a few
[1513.76] lakhs, I would have taken a loan
[1515.48] but would not have taken help from Shajar. But here, it is a
[1517.76] matter of crores that a woman
[1520.36] can go to this extent to take revenge from you.  she
[1522.80] can do anything, you think about this,
[1529.80] first her mother died, then her father left her and went to jail, the
[1533.48] poor girl is left alone, why am I dead? What are you
[1536.72] saying? You wish
[1539.76] you lived my life too and you do
[1541.96] n't worry about her. We all will try that she does
[1544.68] n't feel the lack of family or anything else.
[1546.92] This is your
[1550.08] bigness, she considered her a daughter and not a sister, she
[1553.04] never considered you as her mother in law, leave alone
[1556.44] mother. What are
[1559.64] you saying? I don't have any
[1561.20] complaint against her, I just want her to
[1564.72] keep Shajar happy and I don't
[1568.24] want anything else. I was thinking of taking Raman to meet Umar uncle,
[1574.16] okay, whatever he did was wrong,
[1576.92] but at this time he needs us.
[1579.64] What do you want to do, will you
[1580.96] support him financially? What is the need?
[1584.00] Ran hates her father and you
[1588.44] want to support him, you
[1591.20] got mad, what are you saying? You see,
[1593.72] Naanu, these blood relations don't
[1595.64] break so easily and
[1598.92] only one real relation is left in Amin's life,
[1601.32] Baral and I.  I am taking him to meet him tomorrow
[1604.44] Yes, you should definitely take him But right
[1606.96] now, please go and take care of him He is
[1609.32] exhausted from crying He hasn't eaten anything for two days
[1611.60] Shajar,
[1613.28] go and feed
[1619.44] him [Music] What has happened, feed him Hey, your
[1622.96] health is fine, not yours Amma,
[1625.60] your health is bad, at least check on
[1628.52] what to talk about on what occasion Why are you saying such things
[1630.80] that his mood is getting spoiled Sapai got on
[1634.20] and how was he making you angry We should
[1637.64] think before doing anything
[1642.75] [Music]
[1652.00] Rami We are going to the police station to meet Umar uncle
[1656.80] Yes, Rami

[1664.84] very alone, you have taken him to the hospital I do
[1668.56] n't want to meet

[1675.00] very important for us to meet Uncle

[1683.28] back home now I'm sorry this car will

[1771.52] tired of answering people's questions
[1773.80] I am fed up I am
[1776.68] very embarrassed Baba
[1784.52] how did
[1788.40] all this happen son how will this issue be resolved unless I say something and you don't
[1791.60] listen [
[1797.73] Music]
[1808.60] Su
[1811.20] [Music]
[1831.28] how many days have passed since I came to this house till now
[1834.12] I am staying in the guest room of this house 10
[1837.16] times I tried to convince her but she doesn't
[1839.20] listen to me
[1840.68] I don't think she will ever be able to forgive me from her heart it's
[1843.68] not my problem this is not
[1845.84] my issue you wanted a chance
[1847.60] which you got did you think that if
[1849.88] you begged, fell at her feet,
[1852.16] asked for forgiveness she will forgive you
[1855.04] especially after what you did to her  If you did this,
[1858.08] I too did not forgive you.
[1860.44] Remember my two things. One, that you should not be negligent in the work for which I have
[1864.40] brought you here
[1866.12] and second, that
[1868.16] Bal should not be hurt by any of your actions. Otherwise,
[1871.68] you know very well
[1873.20] what I can do to you. I don't like crying and whining every day.
[1888.40] [Music] What do
[1895.56] they say? Neither of the house nor of the ghat
[1902.17] [Music]
[1906.17] [Music]
[1910.24] Look, I am very sorry
[1914.76] [Music]
[1920.68] Sari Allah Allah, I am thinking of
[1925.08] talking to a good lawyer. We
[1928.64] should help uncle. You and any of your lawyers
[1931.68] cannot do anything for Baba now. Whatever he has done and
[1934.56] whatever proof has come against him,
[1936.52] no one can get him out of the jail. So
[1938.04] please stay. So, why are you doing all this? I
[1940.52] am doing it for your happiness,
[1942.56] Ran, so that you remain happy. See, my happiness lies
[1946.16] in the fact that I do not want to meet him. I have
[1950.04] no sympathy for him. Why are you doing
[1952.76] all this? What kind of a girl are you? You do
[1957.48] not have even a little love for your father in your heart, none at all, because
[1959.60] he is the murderer of my mother and the murderer of his mother.
[1961.76] I don't want to have any kind of association with the murderer
[1967.14] [Music]
[1979.56] Shaz listen to me honestly I feel there has been
[1982.80] some misunderstanding they have
[1984.36] sent us someone else's reports and they
[1986.00] still have mine you come with me
[1988.04] we both will go and talk to the doctor
[1990.76] see there is no possibility of one thing you
[1994.20] know how badly I want to be a
[1997.04] mother this cannot happen Mommy is
[2000.28] not ready to listen to me at all I also cannot
[2002.04] listen to you at this time my
[2004.68] mind cannot accept anything at this time it cannot
[2006.60] believe
[2008.68] so it will be better that you don't give me any further
[2010.64] explanation
[2011.96] leave me alone for some time
[2014.64] leave me alone
[2016.72] please you will not go I will go myself
[2021.56] please how can one thing happen
[2027.44] which pills have
[2031.04] I taken oh
[2046.60] I am not able to understand how Bhabhi took such a big
[2050.00] step
[2052.08] Shaz will never forgive her and yes
[2056.96] I never expected from her that
[2060.04] Raman can do this I am also
[2062.68] sad that she took such a big decision on her own
[2064.72] and did not even include Shajar, it is
[2067.16] possible that the doctor gave the report of a wrong patient,
[2068.92] bhabhi is swearing and
[2071.60] pleading for brother but mom and brother are
[2073.56] not ready to listen to him, you
[2075.80] know very well that she has not
[2077.56] ignored any of our talks, she never lets us down,
[2080.36] but I don't know what has happened to mom, I am
[2082.52] not her enemy, I still
[2084.84] cannot believe that she has done this kind of thing,
[2086.36] look, leave this argument, whatever was to happen has happened, right?
[2089.44] We should talk to Shaaj
[2094.16] and tell him about the medicine that Rami took,
[2098.40] Shajar should also be forgiven, Shajar has
[2101.16] gone to the farm house in anger and his phone is also switched
[2102.84] off, I will go to the farm house and
[2104.76] convince brother, but no, there is no need to
[2106.96] go anywhere, Shajar is very angry and she had
[2109.52] requested me that no one should follow her,
[2110.96] her anger will cool down and she will come back on her own,
[2113.20] yes, I am saying that do
[2115.08] not interfere in the matters of elders, what has happened to
[2117.36] you, I am not a milk-drinking child
[2119.36] and for how long will you keep interfering in these matters  Keep me away from her, don't
[2121.76] argue with me, go to your room,
[2128.32] look Binda, I request you
[2131.68] not to stretch this matter too much, if Shajar gets
[2134.92] angry, he can take any step in anger,
[2137.52] why would I do that, I have
[2140.24] never interfered in his private life, I have
[2142.20] always supported his every decision, she is
[2144.36] not Raman's enemy that she will
[2148.00] provoke Shajar, will mislead him and make him take a wrong
[2150.64] decision, Raman should have thought about this, he should have
[2153.52] asked before doing anything,
[2156.20] but no, she did what she wanted
[2159.64] and the girl who does not
[2163.08] want to take your lineage forward does not have the right to live in this house,
[2165.72] anyway, now what was to happen has happened,
[2169.04] now you convince Shajar and bring her back,
[2172.60] I will convince Shajar, but Raman
[2176.16] cannot live in this house anymore, I cannot allow this thing
[2177.92] and I don't think at all that
[2179.68] Shajar will forgive him, what do you
[2182.88] mean, you will ruin his home over such a small thing, it is a
[2189.96] matter of great regret, you are also a
[2193.20] mother of a daughter, what are you saying,
[2195.32] why should I  I will ruin her home She is
[2197.40] doing this herself and as far as Shajar is
[2199.92] concerned there is no compromise on her happiness
