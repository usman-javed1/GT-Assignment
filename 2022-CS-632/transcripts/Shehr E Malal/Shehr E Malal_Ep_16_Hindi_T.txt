[13.65] Shahnawaz is absolutely right.
[15.82] Why is Kamran insisting to get married
so quickly?
[18.67] You should inquire about this guy too.
[21.45] This house is worth 18 corore
and the business is worth billions!
[24.59] I don't want all of this.
[26.25] You must find a way to tell them
to give cash and jewelry to Minal.
[35.47] You’ve chosen your favorite jewelry,
now you’ll have to wear what I like.
[40.19] I mean...
[42.27]  my mom had some family heirlooms,
[45.18] and she wanted to give
them to her daughter-in-law,
[48.02] - so will you wear them?
- Of course I will.
[50.59] Is that even a question?
[53.37] Thank you. Which mall do you want to go to?
[57.72] Kamran, enough. You've
already made me shop too much.
[60.60] Are you planning to buy
the whole mall or something?
[62.30] If it were up to me, I would
lay the entire world at your feet.
[67.27] You’ve done so much for me.
[69.39] 50 tolas of gold is a lot,
[72.38] no king would have given that
much to his wife on their wedding.
[75.96] Of course, you deserve it.
[78.93] I don’t have anyone
else in this world but you.
[84.72] By the way, I talked to
my mom about the dowry.
[87.59] I told her clearly that Kamran doesn't
want anything except me in dowry.
[93.83] But my mom said she would convince dad
to transfer some shares and property to me.
[100.24] In fact, she has already transferred
5 crores to my account.
[104.06] And regarding the property,
that too will be taken care of.
[107.36] What was the need for all of this?
And besides...
[112.08] I have you now. I don't need anything else.
[116.74] As for your dad's property, I’m not
interested, and neither should you be.
[122.49] Okay.
[124.32] Okay, tell me this, where are you
going to take me for our honeymoon?
[128.79] - Wherever you say.
- Okay.
[131.23] We’ll decide on 5 destinations
and choose one.
[136.47] here will be a great package. Maybe we
can go to Paris, Switzerland, New York.
[141.72] I've always wanted to go to Germany.
[143.51] Maybe we can also do a cruise.
I’m just so excited!
[147.32] I always thought I'd like
a grand tour honeymoon.
[151.96] - What happened?
- No, something got in my eye.
[155.79] -  It's nothing.
- Are you alright?
[158.96] Yes, I’m fine, thank you.
[162.73] So, as I was saying...
[164.98] Do you have any specific
destination in mind?
[170.88] - Whatever you say.
- Okay, then. I’ll plan everything.
[175.15] I’m so excited!
[181.37] Wow, Minal! So much shopping, it
looks like you’ve bought the entire market.
[187.79] Kamran loves me so much, he loves me so
much that he’d bring me the moon and stars.
[194.53] I’m very happy for you. I’m really happy,
but I’m worried about one thing, though.
[198.80] Why does he want to get married so quickly?
And that too with so much simplicity?
[201.92] Khala, he is an only child.
He doesn’t get along with his relatives.
[206.87] Maybe he just wants a simple wedding.
[210.37] But he must have some distant relatives,
right?
[215.10] Nowadays, who keeps up with relatives?
That too with distant relatives?
[218.40] But, dear...
[220.29] we'll still invite his relatives
and friends, right?
[223.88] Otherwise, people will talk and say,
[226.84] "Why did Manal get married so quickly,
and why so simply?"
[230.41] If Kamran and I don’t want
a grand wedding, what’s the issue?
[236.15] By the way, Khala, I have a suggestion.
[237.79] All that you were planning to spend
on her wedding,
[240.09] why don’t you just transfer
that amount to her account?
[242.00] You mind your business.
I know what I’m doing.
[245.67] Go inside and do something.
[257.13] I’ve told him so many times not to
talk about these things in front of her.
[259.96] Kamran is like this, Kamran is
like that... The evil eye will fall on us!
[262.65] We don’t believe in all this.
You’re also talking like Phuppo now!
[266.37] She didn’t say anything.
[267.74] She only said whatever you're going
to spend, you should transfer it to me.
[270.74] You know, since my wedding plans
were confirmed, she’s so excited and happy.
[275.05] Just listen to what I’m saying.
[277.70] Okay, let’s unpack the stuff.
[282.58] Look at this!
[286.99] - Look how beautiful it is.
- So gorgeous, touch wood.
[290.22] It’s beautiful, touch wood, so gorgeous.
[297.86] I bought this penthouse last year.
[302.55] And I want...
[305.87] to transfer it to your name
after the wedding.
[309.49] No, Kamran, no. You’ve done so much for me.
[314.97] You just gifted me the farm house
and now this pent house? No.
[318.89] - No.
- What difference does it make?
[321.99] And besides, everything that’s mine
is yours now.
[326.27] And transferring everything to your name
out of happiness.
[330.23] And...
[332.05] what do I have except you?
[339.53] What happened?
[341.58] Why are you looking at me like that?
[347.20] I never imagined a boy
could love me so much.
[352.21] I mean, I'm just an ordinary girl.
[356.39] But still, you love me so much.
[363.35] The amount of love I have for you...
[367.27] I don't have words to express it.
[371.46] Just think that...
[374.83] I can’t even imagine being without you.
[380.81] I love you with all my heart.
[390.34] Thank you.
[405.56] Manal, give me all your jewelry.
[407.86] I’ll keep it in the safe, and
later I’ll keep it in the bank locker.
[411.80] Why do we need to keep it in the bank? I've
to wear it at parties after the wedding.
[416.16] And there'll be dinners too.
[417.61] Kamran said he has a safe in
his farmhouse; I’ll keep it there.
[422.79] No, no, keeping so much cash
and jewelry at home isn’t safe.
[426.76] Mom, I'm telling you. There's no point
to keep it in the bank.
[430.06] Fine, it’s up to you. Just be careful.
[432.98] Yeah, don't worry.
[440.99] I’ve arranged for the fake property papers.
[448.32] And the jewelry – keep it safe.
[451.86] I have to return that jewelry 2 days
after the wedding.
[455.59] Why do you worry, my friend?
[458.76] You'll get the jewelry back on time,
[461.81] and your money too.
[463.34] Do you have any idea how much cash
and jewelry she’s bringing?
[470.14] I've given her 50 tola.
[472.59] She's getting roughly the same
amount of gold from her family.
[479.98] Her father has transferred
about 5 crores into her account.
[483.53] Everything is going according to plan then.
[485.93] What do you think of your friend?
[488.53] I’ve set this trap so well that
her entire family is involved.
[495.65] And that poor Minal.
[498.52] It feels as if I've done
some sort of magic on her.
[504.93] She just agrees to everything.
[509.26] She was so excited about a grand wedding.
[512.53] I said no once,
and now she’s sitting quietly.
[520.65] Listen, I asked you for an ID card.
[523.79] Did you get it made?
[525.00] Your fake ID card will come tomorrow.
and so will the fake honeymoon tickets.
[532.27] Anything else, my friend?
[615.41] I can't wait anymore.
I've waited long enough.
[620.15] Promise me you'll get my papers ready
and call me to Dubai as soon as you arrive.
[627.12] Kamran, you have no idea how excited I am
to go to Dubai.
[633.85] Listen, you've planned
your business, right?
[640.04] We'll buy our apartment there.
[642.58] You'll go to work daily
and I'll cook for you.
[646.05] It'll be so much fun, right?
[652.29] What are you doing here?
[654.09] I thought Minal would be with you,
I came to see her.
[658.05] You've seen she's not here with me, right?
Then what are you doing here? Go.
[662.20] Were you spying one me?
[664.41] Why would I spy on you, Maria?
[771.81] You know how happy I am today?
[774.88] And on this joyous occasion,
I have a small gift for you.
[780.47] What is this?
[782.23] This is the property paper.
[785.01] "Mu Dikhai."
[786.79] Normally, people give diamond jewelry
for mu dikhai...
[790.74] but I didn’t find anything big enough
for your standard.
[795.65] So, here’s a small gift for you.
[799.02] But what is this?
[801.30] Papers for the farmhouse
and the penthouse.
[804.81] As promised, I’m transferring
everything to your name.
[810.20] Come on, sign these quickly so I
can transfer everything tomorrow.
[816.62] Why the hurry? We can do it later.
[820.68] No, Minal, don’t refuse.
[824.16] I’m giving it with so much love.
[825.73] Today, you’re the owner of the farmhouse,
[829.22] and everything related
to me is yours now.
[837.91] Thank you.
[840.55] But I'll sign these papers tomorrow.
All right?
[845.60] As you wish.
[849.46] - Let's go?
- Let's go.
[865.62] Tell me where are we going
for our honeymoon?
[868.13] We're going to Murree for now.
[870.29] I have a beautiful resort there.
[872.77] Then we’ll head to Singapore
and Malaysia. You’ll love it there.
[878.48] I have no mood for Nathiagali right now.
[881.05] We can do this instead,
we can leave for Malaysia next week.
[883.91] Yes, we can go there, but it's important
for me to go to Murree.
[888.86] I bought some land there,
and construction is going on.
[892.93] Plus, you’ll love the resort.
It’s beautiful.
[896.12] Then I’ll definitely go.
[898.17] Should I make something?
[899.41] No. Just sign these papers.
[904.18] I'll sign them. What's the rush?
[910.73] Okay, give.
[915.50] - Where do I sign?
- Here.
[929.07] Just one more.
[941.53] That's it?
[952.78] The house feels empty without Manal.
I’m not used to living without her.
[957.51] Oh, daughters belong to other people.
[960.49] We have to get used to living without them.
[964.25] I'm just amazed at how
did all of this happen.
[969.00] The proposal came, date got fixed,
and the wedding happened. All so quick!
[973.85] We didn’t have time to think.
[976.82] Once they return from their honeymoon,
I’ll invite all our relatives and friends.
[982.49] I'll host a get together.
I want to introduce Kamran to everyone.
[986.72] Your son-in-law is very nice.
[991.17] - I just hope he keeps Minal happy.
- Ameen.
[995.66] Call and talk to her.
[998.68] My heart will feel peace
once I talk to her.
[1010.24] Is your packing done?
[1012.56] The packing's done.
\I've kept my warm clothes too.
[1016.89] But where's your wardrobe?
Everything's empty inside.
[1021.02] Yeah, I was just-- Yeah!
[1024.58] I used to live in an apartment before.
[1026.37] I was a bachelor then.
My entire wardrobe is still there.
[1029.93] You're here now and we've shifted here, so
I'll bring my clothes here very soon too.
[1036.23] We'll do one thing.
[1037.63] On the way back from our honeymoon,
we'll shift your entire wardrobe here.
[1044.20] I'll do it.
[1046.21] Come on, let's go for a long driver.
I really feel like going.
[1052.12] Minal, we'll keep going out and such.
[1055.72] We're anyway going for
our honeymoon tomorrow.
[1058.02] We have a flight at eight in the morning.
[1059.72] Don't you have to sleep? Come on, go.
Go and sleep.
[1063.55] Okay, I'll go and sleep. Good night.
[1124.45] - So, how's your honeymoon going?
- Very nice!
[1129.18] I'm having a lot of fun.
[1131.06] And thank you so much
for giving me such a brilliant idea
[1135.01] and made me meet a foolish girl
who has a lot of money in her account.
[1139.31] Otherwise, how else would I have
received so much money in my account?
[1141.60] Tell me truthfully; how much money
is there in your account now?
[1145.32] It's a good amount now.
I got her to sign the check very smartly.
[1151.17] The poor girl is sleeping.
I gave her sleeping pills last night.
[1155.34] Today's the last day.
[1156.92] I thought I'd make that poor girl
a little happy.
[1159.22] - I fed her with my own hands.
- Be careful!
[1162.12] That you don't fall in love with her
while feeding her with your hands.
[1165.66] Don't be too frank with her.
[1168.51] Love?
[1170.08] And that foolish girl?
[1172.89] Never.
[1175.24] How can someone love such a foolish girl?
[1179.36] Such stupid girls are only used.
[1182.84] She's very beautiful but what can I do
with her beauty?
[1187.58] I only love you.
[1191.46] And who am I doing all of this for?
For your better future.
[1197.13] Okay, then. I've a flight at 9
am tomorrow, I'm gonna go.
[1201.72] Just pray whatever happens,
it happens after I've left.
[1204.99] Take care of yourself.
[1207.12] And do as we planned.
[1209.85] Don't do anything that's not in the plan
and yes!
[1212.85] Keep calling me, don't just vanish.
I'll be worried about you.
[1216.56] Come on, love. It's just for a few weeks.
[1220.53] Just let me reach Dubai. 
I'll call you there as soon as possible.
[1224.81] And you know what?
[1226.51] I'll buy an apartment in your name.
[1229.44] That both of us will decorate 
with a lot of love.
[1231.96] Where you and I will live.
[1244.76] He hung up.
[1246.69] You...
[1249.42] What are you doing here?
[1251.15] It's cold here, go inside. 
You'll catch a cold.
[1256.11] What's wrong?
[1262.43] I had an important call so I came out.
[1265.70] Go. We have a flight at 8 in the morning,
we'll be late. Go.
[1268.09] - Come on, go.
- Where is that flight to?
[1270.02] To Islamabad? Or Dubai?
[1273.21] Where's that flight to?
[1275.77] Minal, we'll go to Dubai.
What's the big deal?
[1277.80] Enough!
[1279.27] You want to steal from me 
with your girlfriend!
[1282.80] You wanted to commit a fraud against me.
[1286.32] - You're pathetic!
- What do you mean?
[1289.17] What do I mean?
[1290.70] What do I mean? I heard everything!
[1295.46] Why did you do this to me?
[1297.88] - Why did you do this to me?
- There's been a misunderstanding.
[1301.39] - Look, I only love you.
- Shut your nonsense.
[1305.63] Shut your nonsense!
[1310.37] Why did you do this to me?
[1312.09] - Minal, it's nothing like that.
- Stop lying!
[1314.98] - Listen to me!
- You're lying!
[1316.94] Shut up!
[1360.72] This is why I was repeated telling you
not to call me! I'm trapped now.
[1364.65] But you don't listen to anyone.
[1367.35] All because of you. 
I didn't push her on purpose, man.
[1371.29] Tell me nothing happened to her, right?
[1374.03] She's unconscious inside.
[1377.08] If something happened to her,
this matter will escalate to the police.
[1380.29] You're not here! You'll run off to Dubai,
I'll be the one trapped here.
[1384.82] Why are you getting worried? And I
didn't take your name on the phone either?
[1389.11] Right now, I'm only worried about myself.
[1392.34] I'll leave this country tonight somehow.
[1395.62] You don't worry though.
[1397.52] I'll call you there in a few weeks.
[1400.10] All right?
[1401.17] Okay. Call me when you get there
and take care of yourself.
[1418.54] What happened? Is she not picking up?
[1420.41] I've been calling for a really long
time now, no one's picking up. Strange.
[1423.99] Minal never does this.
[1425.60] Come on, it's already very late. 
Is the breakfast ready?
[1428.87] How can we go?
They're not picking up.
[1431.09] It doesn't seem nice to just go like this.
[1433.19] Call Kamran then.
[1435.18] I called him too. His number is either off
or busy.
[1438.85] I think they must've left for the airport.
They're flying to Islamabad today.
[1442.29] No, no. Not the airport.
[1443.89] They were supposed
to meet us before they left.
[1445.06] They won't go like that.
Minal would've called that they're leaving.
[1448.32] - Khala, try once again.
- I'm calling!
[1452.29] Listen, you don't have any other number?
[1454.82] No, I only have this number.
I don't have the landline number either.
[1457.01] It's amazing!
[1458.32] You don't have any number of the house
you sent your daughter to.
[1460.82] There's a limit to carelessness!
[1462.69] You could've taken the number.
I'm not responsible for everything.
[1466.22] I feel very anxious.
[1469.67] It's been so long, we
haven't spoken to anyone.
[1471.41] I haven't spoken to
Minal since yesterday.
[1473.72] Shahzar, quickly go and check on them.
What if there's some emergency?
[1477.66] Shahzar, come. Let's go and check on them.
[1481.39] Yeah, we'll have to check. 
I'll take out the car, please come.
[1484.43] Oh, God have mercy! 
Hope everything's all right.
[1539.81] I won't spare him.
[1541.70] How dare he do something so disgraceful
to my sister?
[1545.73] You'll see!
[1547.54] Wherever he's hiding, I'll find him!
[1552.34] I'll kill him.
[1558.44] Minal, you...
[1560.79] Minal, you're okay, right?
[1572.86] It's been a while since they left.
[1575.75] God have mercy.
[1577.69] We still have no news.
[1580.78] No one's picking up. 
I've called Shahzar multiple times too.
[1583.85] Kamran's phone is also off.
[1585.81] Oh, God have mercy.
[1587.87] What if something has happened
to my daughter?
[1591.09] Don't worry, everything will be fine.
One second.
[1595.83] Shahzar, where are you? I've been
calling for so long. No one's picking up.
[1602.58] Hospital?
[1609.26] Hospital?
[1611.37] Just tell me if Minal's all right.
[1614.87] Minal's completely fine, but...
[1618.10] that Kamran...
[1620.21] who told us he's the owner 
of Shah Motors...
[1623.24] he lied.
[1625.87] He's just a lowly employee there,
nothing else.
[1630.58] What happened to Minal?
[1632.25] - Nothing.
- Tell me what happened to her.
[1633.84] - Nothing happened to her.
- Tell me what happened to Minal!
[1637.03] - Why won't you tell me?
- What happened to my Minal?
[1649.87] - Why won't you talk? Tell me.
- No...
[1652.88] What are you saying?
What you've told me is so weird!
[1657.49] Anyway, how is she doing now?
[1660.15] Mama, she's had a nervous breakdown.
Just pray she recovers soon.
[1666.17] I feel really sad 
but all of this is Tabinda's fault.
[1670.87] She's a 19-year old innocent girl.
[1672.79] Obviously, she doesn’t
know what's good for her.
[1675.75] It's easy to cheat a 19-year old kid.
[1679.10] Tabinda and her father should've inquired
about him.
[1683.61] I've been saying it since then
that it's all very...
[1686.90] Anyway, forget about it.
[1689.17] Tell me, did you find out anything
about that guy?
[1692.16] So far we only know that he's
taken everything and ran off to Dubai.
[1695.48] Minal's jewelry, the jewelry he gave her,
he's taking everything and run away.
[1699.97] Shahzar has just told me that he's
taken a check of 5 corore from here.
[1704.09] He took that too. In fact, the money's
been credited to his account already.
[1710.32] Okay, make me talk to Tabinda.
Let me at least ask.
[1715.22] Mama, I can't get
her to talk to you now.
[1717.22] She's not in a position
to talk, she's crying a lot.
[1719.32] And on top it all, Uncle has put
the entire responsibility on her head.
[1722.77] Okay, which hospital are you at?
Your father and I will come there.
[1726.65] Mama, don't come yet. She
asked me to keep this quiet.
[1731.18] I'm only telling you. Just pray
that everything gets normal.
[1733.90] Pray Minal gets better.
Everything else is fine.
[1736.18] I can understand.
[1737.93] Okay, keep me updated.
[1741.52] I'll pray for Minal. Good bye.
[1751.53] You're absolutely right.
[1753.52] But I've forwarded all of his details
to the IG myself.
[1758.17] You understand what I'm saying,
right?
[1760.67] You know our influence really well.
[1764.12] I don't know anything. All I know is 
I want that man behind bars. At any cost.
[1771.28] Thank you.
[1773.93] I have good news for you.
The patient is awake now.
[1778.93] - Can we meet her?
- Yes, of course.
[1781.21] We'll take you to meet her 
in a little while.
[1783.77] And we'll discharge her 
by tomorrow morning, God willing.
[1788.18] Actually, the patient has been through
severe stress.
[1790.96] Just try not to talk to her 
about anything that's happened to her.
[1796.68] - Yes, of course. Thank you.
- All right?
[1821.17] Do you know how happy I am today?
[1823.41] And on this happy occasion,
I have a small gift for you.
[1827.99] What is this?
[1829.45] These are the papers for this farm house
and my pent house.
[1832.99] According to my promise, I told you
I'd put it all in your name.
[1842.92] From this day on, you're the owner 
of this farm house.
[1845.45] And everything that's mine,
it now belongs to you.
[1850.79] Quickly sign this so I can put it in
your name first thing tomorrow morning.
[1861.88] - Where do I sign?
- Here.
[1909.45] Yes, hello!
[1911.69] Did you reach safely?
[1914.44] Obviously! A storm has to come
once you left.
[1918.17] Did they receive the divorce papers?
[1920.68] Yes.
[1922.10] Really?
[1923.57] So what was the reaction of Minal
and her family?
[1928.04] Minal had a nervous breakdown.
[1930.56] This had to happen. She's not well.
[1934.19] And Shahzar has file an FIR against you.
[1937.52] Don't talk like children.
[1939.91] They can't do anything to me.
They can't even touch a hair on my head.
[1943.67] I'm in Dubai right now.
[1945.68] And Pakistan's law isn't applicable here.
[1949.30] Yeah, I know they can't do anything to you.
You've run abroad!
[1953.51] But they have very strong sources.
[1957.06] They won't let you go like this.
[1959.24] Anyway, tell me how is Minal doing?
[1965.09] You're very worried about her.
[1967.34] Come on, man! I'm only asking
in the name of humanity.
[1972.29] She fainted. She had a nervous breakdown.
[1974.68] She's back from the hospital, 
she's fine now.
[1977.09] Obviously, this was a huge shock.
This reaction was warranted.
[1981.76] Anyway, forget about all of this.
[1983.72] Tell me how's everything in Dubai?
[1987.77] The journey was lovely.
[1989.94] I was thinking about you the whole way.
[1993.94] Maria...
[1995.69] everything that you've done for me...
[1998.41] I can never repay you for that.
[2001.68] I love you.
[2004.36] And there are no favors in love.
[2009.07] Anyway, I'll hang up and go to Khala.
[2012.90] All right.
[2014.61] Good bye.
[2016.27] Okay, we'll talk later.
[2030.21] It's shocking how they blindly trusted
a lying and cheating man.
[2039.82] I'm still in shock. I can't believe it.
[2043.93] Yeah, I was shocked too. It's sad also.
[2047.34] I mean, their family is so influential
and he cheated them so easily.
[2053.07] I can't believe it! 
He pretended to be Kamran Shah?
[2057.07] But the worst part is what Minal
must be going through.
[2063.94] This is all Tabinda's fault.
[2067.61] Do you remember how arrogant she was being
at the day of the nikkah?
[2072.46] She was really showing off 
her husband's and son-in-law's wealth.
[2076.53] She was telling everyone that she
has selected a diamond for her daughter.
[2081.13] People are right, 
pride comes before a fall
[2083.93] Oh, Ammi, forget about it. Let it be.
[2087.59] We have a daughter too.
We should be careful about such things.
[2091.31] We've a daughter that's
why we're saying this.
[2093.66] She has a father and a brother, 
yet no investigation was conducted.
[2098.23] They just married off their daughter 
like that. Just handed her over.
[2102.27] You reap what you sow.
[2106.14] Poor girl.
[2128.31] Out of all the properties I have,
this is the one I like the best.
[2133.41] This is why I'll put it in your name
after the wedding.
[2145.19] What do I do with her beauty?
[2148.17] I only love you.
[2152.05] And who am I doing all of this for?
[2154.46] For your better future.
[2157.76] Okay, then. I have a flight
at 9 in the morning, I'll go.
[2162.35] Just pray whatever happens, 
it happens once I have left.
[2172.53] There's been a misunderstanding.
[2174.22] - Look, I only love you.
- Stop your nonsense!
[2178.07] - Minal, it's nothing like that.
- Stop lying!
[2180.90] - Listen to me!
- You're lying!
[2183.00] Shut up!
[2207.41] If people found out...
[2210.06] that Shahnawaz Malik's only daughter
has been betrayed like this...
[2214.03] so I won't be able to show my face
to anyone.
[2216.85] He came.
[2218.80] And he said that...
[2221.30] He was very happy.
[2224.39] He was very happy to see Minal's life
being ruined.
[2226.94] I'll have to punish him, Mom.
[2229.17] I'll find him and punish him.
[2231.03] No, you won't do any such thing.
[2232.67] I'll take him to the gallows! 
I won't rest until then, Mom.
[2235.71] I'll go to the underground to find him,
but I'll definitely get him punished!
