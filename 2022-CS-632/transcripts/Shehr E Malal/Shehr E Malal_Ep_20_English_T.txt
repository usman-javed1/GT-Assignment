[13.61] You've gone out of your way for no reason.
[15.97] Rameen always makes coffee for me,
and I only like the coffee she makes.
[21.19] You can forget about that.
[24.92] What are the doctors saying?
Will Mehru survive?
[30.16] The doctors have given up.
[34.07] Mama, why did you reject their offer?
[37.90] You know Baba's financial situation.
[41.45] He doesn't have any property that
he can sell to fund your treatment.
[46.21] For the last time, for my sake,
just listen to me.  Please.
[52.97] Please, please, please.
[56.88] Here we go.
[60.74] Please don't make childish demands.
[63.91] This is not socially unacceptable.
[67.20] A girl's family never asks for help
from her in-laws.
[73.92] Mom...
[75.70] they are very well-off.
[77.52] A sum of 10-15 lakhs won't matter to them.
[82.35] Sure, they have wealth.
[85.22] We have no right over their wealth, right?
[89.55] Look.
[91.95] Shahzar's mother herself called me.
[95.76] I know she seems very bitter,
but her heart is very pure.
[99.55] She assured me that she will
get you treated in the best hospital.
[106.19] Rameen, please.
[108.67] Please stop defending my mother-in-law
and focus on your husband.
[114.47] Why?
[116.93] Do you think he is not happy with me?
[122.12] What was the need to cancel the
Turkey trip without asking Shahzar?
[129.06] He was very upset when he left.
[132.14] Mama...
[134.35] right now, I am more worried about
your health than Shahzar's anger.
[141.17] We have our whole life to travel
and explore.
[145.77] Keep it down.
[162.78] When girls get married, Rameen,
[166.37] their husband and in-laws become the
most important in their lives.
[173.83] What do I have in your life now?
I'm here today, I won't be here tomorrow.
[177.27] But your entire life is ahead of you.
[183.50] Focus on your home, Rameen.
[186.25] Take care of your in-laws
and your husband.
[192.38] Make him happy.
Otherwise, he will get frustrated.
[196.69] - Do you understand?  -Yes
.
[200.68] - I love you.
- I love you.
[203.96] This is Kamran's flight details.
[211.63] Now what should we do?
[213.40] what else?
[214.72] His plane will land here at 11.
Our people need to be at the airport by 10,
[220.38] and as soon as he comes out,
[222.99] it should be as you wish.
[228.09] I hate him.  The only thing that bothers
me is that I can't punish him.
[233.06] He deceived me so easily
and you did nothing.
[238.02] Why?
[241.86] He needs to be punished.
He needs to know who he deceived.
[246.75] I'll take him to the gallows.
I won't be at peace until then.
[249.73] I'll go to hell to find him,
but he will be punished.
[267.95] Mehru.
[270.03] Come.
[271.49] I have brought breakfast for you.
Let me feed you.  I'll have the soup first.
[279.00] -Come on.
- Umar, please listen to me.
[283.40] will you listen to me?
[288.02] Whether you tell me or not...
[291.15] I know I don't have much time left.
[298.09] Please, don't waste any more money
on my treatment.
[303.04] Please.
[307.96] I want to spend my last
moments with you at home,
[312.90] not in any hospital.
[323.30] Mehru, do you know anything?
[325.69] In fact, I'm sure you know it.
[327.93] We've been together for so many years.
[330.89] But funnily enough, I’ve never
thought of my life without you.
[335.43] Neither have I.
[339.87] I haven't had a moment without your
thoughts, your memories.  Without you.
[347.22] Everyone has to leave this world,
[349.43] and they have to go at the time fixed
for them.
[353.06] But should we give up on everything?
[357.59] Shouldn't we try?
[360.55] Shouldn't we have hope,
shouldn't we get treatment?
[364.20] Fine, we won't go to the hospital.
[367.10] We can still treat you at home.
[374.94] Get up.  Let's have breakfast.
[377.33] Have some soup.  Come on,
sit a little further.  Good!
[380.18] - I won't eat the egg.
- I won't feed you eggs, come on.
[382.11] Show a little bit of strength.  Come on.
[478.55] Sir, you didn't mention where we are going.
[480.23] I need to go to the railway station.
[483.31] - We'll reach in 30 minutes, right?
- Yes, sir, we will reach.  Don't worry.
[487.96] Here comes our car.
[489.68] Look at this and get in.   Get in!
[496.52] -What are you doing?  Leave me!
-Shut up!  Sit quietly.
[500.77] Easy!
[505.57] Please, Rameen, keep it down.
I'll have it later.
[509.80] It will get cold anyway.  Besides, Dado
said to make you eat the whole soup.
[513.66] I'm not so ill
that I can't have my own soup.
[526.07] Mama, I am very upset with you.
[529.79] You never gave Shahzar and I a chance
to help you.
[534.55] He thinks you don't consider him your son.
[539.48] It's not like that.
[543.24] I didn't refuse treatment
for the reasons you think.
[546.96] The doctors say it's very
necessary for you to be admitted.
[550.46] Cancer can spread.
[554.02] I don't want to go through
chemotherapy again.
[560.49] If that treatment doesn't help, then
why should I endure so much pain?
[567.92] - Have you become so hopeless?
- I am not hopeless.
[572.00] I am being realistic.
[574.96] I heard what the doctor said, dear.
[578.24] What can happen at most?
[580.15] I might survive for only two more years
with chemotherapy.
[586.08] What's the point?
[588.26] I won't completely get better.
[590.41] Amma, please don't say such things.
[594.32] Have some mercy on me.
[598.61] You all should realize one thing.
[602.90] We all will die one day, dear.
[606.08] I know who's putting all this nonsense
in your head.
[612.49] what does he think?  Do I not know
how honest and self-respecting he is?
[616.97] Mama, I'm going to talk to him today.
[620.18] - You will not do such a thing, Rameen.
-Why?
[624.19] If I won't do it now
then when will I do it?
[627.12] -You won't stop me today.  That's it.
- Rameen--
[651.00] Shahzar and Shahnawaz
should not know about this.
[655.21] You don't have to worry about that.
They won't find out.
[659.97] Also, I have kept Kamran locked up.
[663.30] I was thinking if we could hand him over
to the police.
[671.81] I thought about it.  I had the same plan,
but I changed my mind.
[675.12] How long will it take for him to get bail?
He must have strong connections too.
[679.24] He's well connected too.
[685.02] No.
[686.60] I won't allow the man who hurt Minal
to walk around freely.
[691.87] Never!
[692.79] Look, you're being emotional.
[695.11] The biggest benefit of this will be
getting your jewellery and money back.
[699.69] I don't care about that.
I don't need anything.
[702.53] I only care about Minal.
[707.58] I want to take revenge
for the pain she's gone through.
[711.93] Revenge for every single tear she shed.
[743.01] Oh, God, grant my Mehru a long life.
[747.35] If you want, you can give her
all the moments of my life.
[752.72] But please save my Mehru.
[757.69] How can I watch her approach death
every moment?
[762.78] I don't have the strength.
[766.84] Oh, God, please save my Mehru.
[770.34] Have mercy on her.  Do
[796.31] you want to kill her?
[801.62] Why don't you understand
that she's useless to you now?
[806.38] She can't help you anymore.
[810.38] When my in-laws are saying they'll get
her treated, then why are you objecting?
[815.97] A woman who supported you her whole life,
[820.28] who stood with you throughout everything, you're not
supporting her at this time?
[824.76] Seriously?
[826.34] What have you given her except stress
her whole life?
[831.90] Say it.
[833.77] Say whatever there is in your heart today.
I want to hear it.
[840.52] - Rameen.
- One minute, Mehru.
[843.32] Let me talk to her today.
[846.20] Today, I want everything
in your heart to come out.
[849.94] Everything is in your mind that is doubt.
I want to answer all of it.
[853.23] -You go inside.
-No, no.  why are you sending her away?
[857.27] She won't go anywhere.
[859.16] Whatever is to be said,
it will be in front of her.
[863.59] And you're going to answer in front of her
about why you're doing all this.
[868.57] Tell me, what's her fault?
Why won't you let her get treated?
[872.36] Why won't I let her get treated?
[874.72] I got her treated all her life.
[877.03] But if I need to sell myself to
treat her now, I'm ready for that too.
[881.28] The only thing I can't do
is compromise my pride.
[884.71] - That I can't ask your in-laws--
- Stop it.
[887.83] Stop!  Please stop!  I've given this
lecture about pride way too many times.
[893.69] It doesn't suit you.  what do you think?
I don't know anything?  Am I a fool?  -That
[898.02] I don't see everything?
- Rameen!
[900.86] You think I'm a fool and don't see what
you say behind my back to my mother-in-law?
[905.79] You're calling her, asking her to pay
all your debts,
[909.21] she's getting you a job, you--
[912.01] One minute, one minute.  Relax.
Who told you that I am calling her?
[915.78] Do you think I'm a kid, I'm a fool?
[918.80] That I don't know anything?
[920.50] The job you're so proud of these days,
my mother-in-law got you that job.
[930.06] Otherwise, your reputation is so bad now
that no one will--
[934.99] anyway.
[937.07] I didn't come here to fight.
[940.87] I came to tell you
[943.33] that don't stay under the
delusion that I will let you stay here...
[948.15] in this conditions.
[952.71] Tomorrow evening, I will come
with Shahzar to pick Mama up.
[956.54] I'll take her from here.  And that's final.
[1017.37] You've cut it so well.
[1019.65] But the flowers are all old.
Plant some new ones.
[1022.92] The soil needs to be changed
since the season has changed.
[1025.98] So I have to plant new flowers now.
[1028.66] All right, fine, but do it
so you can plant the flowers.  -Yes
[1032.01] .  -Make
sure it looks beautiful.  Come on.
[1033.51] -Yeah, I'll call you the soil guy now.
- Right.  Okay.
[1056.37] Rameen.
[1060.35] My dear, why are you crying?
[1067.66] Nothing.
[1070.82] What is it?  Tell me.
[1073.23] What is it?
[1075.48] Is Mehr-un-Nisa okay?
[1079.03] She's barely alive.
[1084.89] what are you saying?
[1087.84] Child, we'll all pray for her.
[1091.89] She will get better soon.
[1096.56] Phuppo, the doctors have given up.
[1101.81] Nothing can be done.
[1105.18] No doctor in the world can save my mother.
[1112.27] Phuppo, my mother is dying,
and I can't do anything.
[1115.62] No, dear, don't say that.
[1118.50] Don't say that, dear.
[1120.99] You'll see.  We'll all pray for her.
[1124.19] She will get better soon.
[1127.34] My child!
[1128.61] Come here.  Just pray.
[1131.44] Pray for your mother.  God will listen.
[1147.47] What did Rameen say?
[1154.69] I got this job...
[1157.42] through Tabinda's reference.
[1160.30] And you, Mehru, you knew about it.
[1165.28] You hid it from me.  But why?
[1172.76] I got to know about it very late.
[1177.04] You were so excited that you finally
found a good job.
[1182.18] I didn't want to make you sad.
[1191.48] I will resign from this job tomorrow.
[1195.03] I can't take any favors from this woman.
[1198.22] Omar, just listen to me.
[1203.55] Both of us know that Tabinda
is a very bad woman.
[1207.87] But her heart isn't so rotten.
[1211.39] Do you remember...
[1214.24] when Rameen tried to commit suicide
and the media attacked you?
[1220.04] who saved us?
[1221.57] She was the one who convinced her husband
to let Shahzar marry our daughter, right?
[1229.70] Listen, don't let your ego and anger...
[1235.85] give in to the idea of ​​resignation.
[1237.65] Rameen is already so upset with you.
If you do this, she'll be even more upset.
[1245.45] This isn't my ego.
[1249.26] This is my stubbornness.
[1251.99] I won't take any favors from that woman.  It
[1255.27] doesn't matter what.
[1311.61] - Did you order something for him?
- Yeah, it'll be delivered soon.
[1320.99] Oh, here it comes.
[1323.23] Get water also.
[1326.97] Sit, man.  Look, I'm losing.
[1341.64] Here!
[1343.58] Eat.
[1347.95] Who are you people?  Why have you
brought me here?  what do you want?
[1351.59] Untie me!
[1353.58] By tonight, you'll know who we
are and why we brought you here.
[1358.45] -Eat it.
-Untie me!
[1362.81] Eat it, you'll die.
[1365.68] Eat!
[1368.85] Untie my hands.  how am I gonna eat?
[1372.18] Eat it as you normally do.  We'll
have to beat him up to make him eat.
[1375.42] Eat your good.
[1380.88] Come on, come on, come on.
[1384.75] I told you, I'm losing.
You've made it worse.
[1387.52] Come on, man.
[1389.65] - I can't eat it!
-Come on, son, eat!
[1392.46] Just eat how you've eaten up
other people's money.
[1398.47] 5, you're out.  Take a side, come on!
[1437.88] Come on, you're out.
[1448.71] Sabra!
[1451.09] Razia!
[1452.54] Fazlu?  Where have you all gone
and died?
[1455.74] What's the issue?  Huh?
[1458.86] Why are you shouting and calling everyone?
They are not your servants...
[1465.15] that they will come running if you call.
[1467.53] I know exactly how to talk to whom.
[1470.57] You don't need to teach me manners,
watch your film!
[1473.29] Girl, you are a guest in this
house for just a few days.
[1479.54] My daughter gave you a place in her home,
[1482.17] and now you think you're the
mistress of this house?
[1486.90] Hello!  Who do you think you are?  Do
[1491.59] you think you're the mistress
of this house?
[1493.81] This is my daughter's house, and my
son-in-law has kept me here like family.
[1502.47] do you understand?
Now, stay within your limits.
[1505.11] You are crossing your limits now.  It
[1507.72] ruined my mood.
[1509.97] Where is everyone?
[1513.62] Such a big drama, this idiot.
[1531.85] why did you bring me here?
I didn't do anything.
[1536.44] I didn't do anything.
[1538.46] I didn't do anything.
why did you bring me here?
[1541.81] Who brought me here?
[1544.40] -Who brought me here?  -I
brought you here!
[1551.73] Now, you must have understood
why you were brought here.
[1560.38] Tell me!
[1562.90] Tell me, why did you do this to Minal?
[1566.78] Speak up!  Why did you deceive her?
[1569.72] Why did you betray her?
[1571.71] She loved you with all her heart,
and this is how you repaid her.
[1575.68] Please forgive me!
[1576.58] I will take revenge for every tear
Minal shed.
[1579.56] I will account for each one of them.
[1582.92] - I am not one to forgive easily.
- Please forgive me.
[1586.70] You are not worthy of being forgiven.
[1589.87] what do you think?  You're going to be
punished for what you've done.
[1594.48] I will not let you go so easily, do
you understand?
[1597.81] Beat him up.
[1600.28] Beat him, beat him so much
[1602.49] that he will never again be able to destroy
an innocent girl's life.
[1609.00] But, Tabinda, his family has already filed
a report with the police,
[1612.88] so if they reach here,
it will cause trouble for us.
[1617.95] I don't care.
[1626.14] He is going to die.  Look, we've
punished him, he's also apologizing...
[1655.27] There's no news of Kamran.
We're very worried.
[1661.31] His wedding is in two days.
[1667.02] His phone is off too.
[1669.21] I thought I'd call and ask you.
[1671.83] Maybe you'd know something about him.
Have you been in touch with him?
[1675.57] My relationship ended with him the
moment you told me about his engagement.
[1680.01] Anyway, when did he come back from Dubai?
[1683.15] He came back yesterday.
He's been missing ever since.
[1687.37] I've filed a missing person's report
with the police.
[1691.10] I thought I'd ask you;
maybe you've had some contact with him.
[1696.45] Fine.  I'll let you know.
[1698.13] If you find anything out,
let me know immediately too.
[1714.72] Hello, I need to talk to you
about something very important.
[1718.70] What's the urgent matter?
[1721.80] Do you need money or something?
[1725.46] I can help you catch Kamran,
but on one condition.
[1731.17] Khala can't know about it.
[1733.21] How do you know Kamran?
[1796.59] Be careful, dear.
[1798.42] I don't want you to get involved in
any trouble while seeking revenge.
[1805.12] And tell Qayyum to stop torturing Kamran.
[1809.91] If he died or something,
we'll be in a serious situation.
[1814.16] Then his family will file
a murder case against you.
[1820.28] I feel like shooting him with my own hands!
[1822.98] Oh, have you gone mad?
Do you want to ruin your life?
[1827.56] I say, take your money back from him
and let him go.
[1834.13] Don't create new trouble for yourself
by taking his life.
[1838.84] Then it's a whole new drama.
[1841.55] I can't let him go so easily.
[1850.68] Mr.  Umar, it's only been a few months
since you joined our company.
[1859.61] And you've already resigned.
[1863.55] Me and the whole company
are really happy with your work.
[1870.67] I... Sir, I really appreciate it,
but I have some family issues.
[1877.60] My wife, she's not well actually.
[1881.04] I feel like she really needs me
and in these conditions,
[1885.88] it'll be very hard for me to continue this
job, sir.
[1889.30] I do understand it.
I feel very sorry for that.
[1894.28] For your wife, specially.
[1895.96] But the thing is, I cannot accept
your resignation in such a hurry.
[1903.06] Do one thing.  Go home,
[1907.94] take some time to think
about this matter thoroughly.
[1913.66] If you want, take a few days off.
[1917.90] But, you see, I just assigned
you to the China project,
[1923.78] and I can't trust anyone
else with it right now.
[1940.51] I heard you resigned.
[1943.26] Yes, you heard it correctly.
[1946.21] But Mr.  Baqar hasn't
accepted your resignation yet.
[1950.85] Thank you for referring me for this job,
but I had a request.
[1956.71] After today, please don't do me
or my family any favors.
[1962.47] If you do something for your own family,
that's not a favor.
[1965.90] Whatever you did with me, don't worry, I wo
n't do anything like that to you.
[1973.27] I ended the relationship.
[1975.81] But my mother and I weren't unfair to you.
[1979.75] Just a relationship?
[1981.67] What could be more unfair
than ending that relationship?
[1985.38] Anyway, why are we discussing this now?
[1990.20] The most important thing right now
is your job.
[1994.07] I request that you withdraw
your resignation.
[1998.42] Mr.  Baqar has also asked me
to talk to you.
[2001.26] I need to talk to you
about something important.
[2002.89] Is it possible to meet at the same
coffee shop where we met last time?
[2007.87] I’d like to talk to you as well,
but unfortunately,
[2011.40] I have some important prior
commitments this evening.
[2014.44] How about tomorrow?
We will meet tomorrow, in the day.
[2018.81] Okay.
[2020.24] Okay, good bye.
[2044.38] Leaving your job was not a wise decision.
[2048.34] You really need this job
in these circumstances.
[2053.22] You got this great opportunity
with a lot of effort,
[2056.37] and now you've resigned.
[2059.19] If I had known earlier... that
[2062.32] this job came through Tabinda's
reference, I would have never accepted it.
[2067.67] I'm surprised that Rameen hid such a big
thing from me.  Mehru didn't tell me either.
[2072.86] What do I do?
[2074.86] You know that she doesn't do anything
without a reason.
[2092.39] But given our current situation...
[2096.65] now we...
[2099.84] we need to think ahead.
[2105.20] Forget the past.
[2107.61] It's better for all of us.
[2110.67] Think about the present and future.
[2113.61] How do I forget it?  Tell me.
[2117.06] Do you remember what Abbu used to say?
[2120.67] If a woman loves,
she destroys herself for that love.
[2126.72] And if she hates,
she destroys the other person.
[2133.05] Tabinda...
[2135.75] Tabinda wants to take revenge
on me for every bit of life...
[2143.36] she’s imagined getting back at me for.
[2144.50] She has reached a point where she
can't hear anything nor understand.
[2157.26] I expect everything from her, Ammi Ji.
