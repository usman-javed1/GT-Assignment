No, no. See, it's very important for me
to get this project by any means. It's very crucial for our company. Do whatever it takes,
just make such a quotation... What? What do you think about it? I’ve done some work on this, sir. You must have heard of
Shah Nawaz Enterprises, sir. Sir, it’s a very reliable company, and
their previous record is also very good. Yes, but... our record isn’t bad either. Make the quotation, and make it in such a way that they
can’t refuse, and we get this contract. Okay, sir, don't worry. I’ll prepare
and send the proposal tomorrow. No, not tomorrow, do it today. Even if you have to stay here until night,
do it and let me know today. I want to send it to them tomorrow. I’ll complete it today and send it today.
You don't worry. Thank you. Do take a look at this. This is Umar Hassan,
a major businessman from Lahore. But he’s facing a crisis
in his business there, so he packed up everything
and came to Karachi. What is it?
What are you writing in my diary? Hey, this is the signature I
will put on the marriage contract. - Oh, it's a special signature?
- Yes. Now you put your signature here, the same
one you'll put on the marriage contract. - What’s this?
- This is my signature. What kind of signature is this?
It’s crooked like your. Just manage with this. Man, what kind of a girl are you?
Just take your diary. Did you read my diary? No, I didn't read it. Just prayed on it. - What did you pray on it?
- The magic of love. - My advice to you is that you...
- You keep your advice to yourself. Oh, I was just making a suggestion. I don’t need your suggestion. Who is the decision-maker here?
It’s me, right? Reject it. - Rather throw it in the trash bin.
- You are being unreasonable, madam. Just do as I say. It’s been almost two years, and in these two years,
there hasn’t been a moment when I haven’t mentioned
your name with my heartbeat. I never thought that our friendship
would turn into love like this. You are the most
beautiful feeling of my life. Now I can’t imagine
living life without you. What’s wrong, Shahzar? I finally managed to fall
asleep after so much effort. I talked to you for two
hours and fell asleep. I needed to give you some good news. It'll make you lose sleep when you hear it. What’s the good news? I’m coming to Pakistan
the day after tomorrow. What? Thi-- this-- Why are you coming so soon? And why are you telling
me on such short notice? I wanted to surprise you,
but honestly, I couldn’t wait. Well, that's okay, but... I mean, what’s the reason
for coming like this? There are two reasons. The first reason is that Mom
is looking for a bride for me. She wants me to get married
and as soon as possible. If you wanted to marry someone of
your mother’s choice, why didn’t you-- Some wretched person has told her that... the girl she’s looking for,
I've already found her and her name is Rameen Ahmed. - I will  only marry her.
- Okay. Sorry, I made a mistake. By the way, I’ve noticed that
since we moved to Karachi, you’ve been much busier with your business. Rameen also complained
that Baba doesn’t have time for us anymore. Now, it's a new city, a new place, new partners. It takes time to adjust. Why don’t you admit it?
You’ve fallen in love with your work. Even when you're with us,
your attention is always on your work. Yes, I remembered.
What was his name? Yes! Mr. Manzoor. He has arrived from Australia. I was thinking of hosting a dinner for him
at home tomorrow, or maybe on Sunday. Umar, this Mr. Manzoor is the same
person who was a friend of my father? And also his business partner. What happened is... from his talks, it seems that
he is interested in our Rameen. - His son is studying medicine.
- Right. And from what I think, it seems like
he’s coming for Rameen's proposal. Seriously? I really like the family.
If they propose, I will accept. Don’t you think we should
ask our daughter first? Umar, Rameen is still a child. What
does she know what's good for her or not? That's my point. Rameen is still a child.
Her education is not yet complete either. But, Umar... don’t you think that... it’s time for her to be married? It's the last stage of the cancer. Before I die... I want to be a part of her happiness. You’ve fought so bravely against
this illness throughout your life. - What happened now?
- My courage has run out. I'm tired, Umar. I don’t think I have much time left. Don't you dare say anything
like this again. Nothing will happen to you, and
God willing, I won’t let anything happen. How long will you keep selling your
business shares to pay for my treatment? Until the end. I will keep selling until
there’s nothing left. If I have to sell myself
for your treatment, I will. But don't say anything like this
after today. Do you understand? That's it. Take care of yourself. Look. This color will suit you very well. No. Shahzar doesn’t like light colors. You’re already thinking so much
about his preferences. See, when you love someone, you have to keep their
likes and dislikes in mind. If he doesn’t like light colors,
why should I wear it? Simple. You are a modern girl.
Such things don’t suit you. Arwa, I didn’t call you here for a lecture. Please quickly select a dress. Please! This is a dark color, not bad.
I can wear this. Yes, just go with this. All right. And cancel all my appointments
for today. I am busy. Ayub group? Yes, set a time with them
for tomorrow after noon. Yes, cancel everything for today. All right. Thank you. Come in. Here are some documents for you to sign. I heard that Mr. Shahzar is coming. Yes, Shahzar is coming after completing
his education. I’m very excited. And it’s also Manal's birthday.
Today is a special day. By the way, madam, it’s a big deal how you’ve managed the house and
office after Mr. Shahnawaz’s accident. It's amazing. - Is that all?
- Yes. Here. Tabinda. That... I asked you for a favor. What? The one with the covering... It'll be done. Look, I also want to travel in a nice car-- Don't worry. I told you it'll be done. Thank you. Thank you. Okay tell me!
What do you think of my hairstyle? It's not that great, it's just okay. What do you mean? I made this after so much time and
hard work and you're making such bad faces? Oh, man! I'm just kidding. Why do you take everything I say
so seriously? I was just pulling your leg! You've to come to the airport tomorrow
to receive me. - Me?
- Why? Don't you want to? No, I want to come, but... Look, I want your face to be the first
thing I see after coming to Pakistan. Shahzar... Your mom will agree for our wedding, right? I've told you a lot of things about Mom. She's my step-mom, but... she has loved me more
than my own mother would've. I'm sure she'll have no objections to it. You know this is the first time
I've heard this. Here, the concept of step-mothers is
that they're very cruel. Yeah, you're right. They really are. And you'll see that once you meet Mom... you'll feel lucky as well.
You'll love her as much as I do. Now, you're praising her so much
that I really want to meet her too! But should I tell you something? Your mom's name should be
in the  Guinness World Records. She the best mom, the best working woman,
and the best wife. Do you not know Shahzar bhai is
coming soon? Did you clean everything? - Did you clean the lounge?
- Yes, Aapa, I did it. - And dusting the drawing room?
- Only a little bit is left. Clean it properly. I don't want to see
any dust or spider webs. - Yes, Aapa.
- Be careful. Azar bhai is very particular. Oh, and listen! Remove the bed sheets off of the sofas.
They're still there. Hurry up! Kiran! - Kiran!
- Yes, Aapa? - Is the food ready?
- Yes. All right. You prepare the salad and the
yogurt sauce. Fry the Shami kebabs too. And get the new crockery out
and make kheer for dessert, all right? Yes. Yes, dear, you got your room cleaned? I got everything done under my supervision,
everything! Fine, child. Just take a look at it again. You know about her, you know
how much she likes cleanliness, And get the bedsheets changed too,
and get the bouqets out. I just did it, Phuppo. I'm tired. I can't do it anymore.
Why do you worry so much? I've done everything, everything! Oh, wow. Everyone's a little too excited
with Shahzar coming this time. You're doing a lot of preparations. There's another reason for it.
But you'll have to guess it for yourself. You forgot, right?
You forgot this time too! You forgot my birthday! I'm so sorry, my dear. I'm so sorry! You always do this! Sometimes
it feels as if I'm the step-daughter. Oh, what happened, child?
How can you even think that? I'm so sorry! This is what you always do!
You always forget her birthday. I'll go and cheer her up. Madam? - I've sent sir's clothes to the laundry.
- Good. Tell me what should I make for dinner? Umar’s friends are
coming for dinner tonight. I’ll sit with you
and properly prepare the menu. We’ll do desi. They like desi food.
There's chicken at home? - Yes.
- There's mutton too. - Yes.
- Oh, wow. Where are you going? You know my friend? She's called me over.
I’m just going to meet her. - All right? Okay, bye.
- Okay, listen to me! - Come back quickly, keep your mobile on.
- Bye. Drive carefully! I don't know why this girl is always
in such a hurry. I don’t know why Umar has
given her a car for her birthday. It's so unsafe. Dad doesn’t even remember
his only daughter’s birthday. And Mom? She’s always busy with office
and business. Sometimes I feel like I’m the
most useless thing in this house. Nobody cares. Manal. Look, child, don’t think like that. In this house, Bhai is always
given importance, and I’m neglected. Mom still spends time with me, but Dad?
He has confined himself to his room. I’m also worried about him now. He argues with his wife about every little
things and screams at the house staff. Was Dad always like this? No, child. You know, that... 20 years ago when he had the
car accident, he was left with broken legs. Since then, he’s become so irritable
that he locked himself in his room. He doesn’t look after the house
or the business. But, my dear,
it’s not that he doesn’t love you all. - He loves you!
- Then why don't I see his love? Manal. Why do you torment yourself
by thinking all of this? All of us love you, my child. Not all of us. Just you. If you weren’t in this house,
I would have suffocated to death. - You are the best phuppo in the world.
- My baby! It didn't come out great today! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Manal. Happy birthday to you. - Give it to Dad too. Dad, Dad, Dad!
- Oh, Dad-- - And now it's my turn.
- Big bite! I'll just go and give her the gift. Take it carefully. Yes, you fly! Here you go, madam, your gift! No, that's not it. Gift! - What's in that?
- In what? In that! That thing that you're hiding
from me. Oh, man, forget about it.
There's nothing in this. - I've got this for you, take this.
- No, first I wanna know-- No, I'm telling you. Do not touch this.
This isn't for you. This is for someone else. Okay. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. - Welcom--
- Okay, Bhai, okay! Give that gift back to me-- My gift-- Look, I'm telling you,
don't do this. - Take this!
- I'm tell you, give it back. - Here!
- Man, this is cheating. This is-- - You tell me what's in this.
- Return it to me! I-- I'm telling you! You fly! I'm running from here! Give it back, I said! I--  I-- Man, look! This is cheating. Don't do this! Mom, I'm telling you. This is very
precious to me. I-- I'll not spare her! - Don't move. Don't move. No, no, no!
- Give it back! - Give it back!
- Manal! - I'll catch you!
- What is this? - Oh! No.
- Don't move! Ladies perfume! - Who is it for?
- It's for me! Who is it for? Mom? - Look at this! Look at this!
- This-- This ladies perfume. Ladies perfume for you? No! It's for Mom. For Mom! It's for Mom.
Then why didn't he tell you before? Surprise! - It's a surprise for Mom!
- You're lying, right? Give it to me. I'll give it to Mom. - You're lying, right?
- I'm not lying. I-- She's no naughty. Look how she's messing
with her brother. Hello? Shahzar, where have you been?
I've been calling you since so long. Don't ask me, man. It was Manal's birthday.
We arranged a small party for her. I was caught up with that.
It was hard to get out of it. Hello? What happened? Are you upset? Yes, I am. But not because you called late. I just didn't like it that you introduced
me as a class fellow to your mother. Right! Then what did you want me
to say to her? I should've told her, "Come, Mom. Meet her. I want to marry her.
She's your future daughter-in-law." Yes, so what? What would have
been your reaction had you said it? I don't know, man. I don't know, Shahzar. I found your mom
to be the angry kind. Oh, no, no. There's nothing like that. She looks a bit harsh when you look at her,
the angry kind. But she's really soft otherwise. She meets everyone with a lot of love. And today she saw at the airport, I was noticing her expressions,
she was very happy. - That's why I've made a decision.
- What decision? That you're gonna be my wife. How'd you like my decision? Come in! - Oh, you! I'll talk to you later. Bye.
- Shahzar, listen to me-- A little longer-- Why did you have to do it? I mean,
where's the house staff? Has it ever happened before? That I didn't do your chores myself? - Yes, but I've grown up now.
- Not for me! Yes. Come on, finish it. What's going on? Your face is glowing! Tell me something, man.
Do you know magic or something? How do you read what's on my face,
know what's in my heart? Who'll know it if not me? I read your face. Tell me, who is it?
Did you like someone in America? Oh, In America? No way.
American girls are just-- Leave it.
Their stories aren't worth telling. - This is someone else?
- Really? Who is it? Tell me quickly. Her name is Rameen. The one at the airport-- Who we met at the airport? Man, you definitely possess some magic.
I'm telling you. - Yes, it's her.
- How'd you meet her? We just got in touch through the internet. Slowly how the time passed, and how we got closer and closer?
We didn't even realize it. On the internet. Interesting. See it through-- Anyway. I made so many plans for you though. No, no. You don't have to worry about it. Rameen is not a typical girl.
You'll really like her once you meet her. I'm sure. She must be the best
if you liked her! Come on, you rest. You must be tired.
We'll talk later. - All right.
- Finish this. Yes, yes, yes. - As always. Good night!
- Good night. Shahzar has become friends with someone
on the internet, Facebook or something, some girl and now he wants me
to take his proposal to her house. Then go. What's wrong with that? He has to marry someone. Yes, but I don't know what kind of
people are they. What their family is like. I agree with you to that extent. Marriage should be between
families of equal status... or similar backgrounds. These.. these girls are  from small
and poor families. They only look for money and property. Even if it means marrying an old,
ill-tempered person. I'm passing my life somehow. But I can't my son's life be ruined. You're forgetting that you proposed to me.
I didn't propose to you. You were the one who begged, not me. Otherwise, with a man like you,
a bitter man like you, I had no desire to spend my life with them
or marry them. We got married for a deal. You were attracted to my money
and my property. It wasn't a deal, it was my necessity. And I regret it. I'm thinking why I severed my own foot. You’re right. At this moment, you would either be the
wife of a clerk or a shopkeeper. - And he would've shown you your worth.
- Maybe that would've been better. What do you want to prove
by saying all these despicable things? The money and status you talk about,
Mr. Shahnawaz, who's handling all of that? Who's looking after your home
and your properties? Who looks after your office? Had it been anyone else apart from me,
they would've left you a long time ago. You should be ashamed. It's not me who should be ashamed,
it should be you! You've taken control over everything
anyway! You caused my children
to become estranged from me. I don’t know what spell you’ve cast on
him; he keeps moving around you constantly. You're right he's not my blood. I'm not related to Shahzar by blood.
He's my step-son! But how can you deny the fact
that I stay awake at nights for him? I've raised him!
I've cared for his future. I've loved him more
than a biological mother! There must be some agenda
of yours behind this too. Stop it! Stop it, Shahnawaz, stop it! I'm tired. I'm done! With your bitter and hateful words,
you have driven me away from yourself. What do you want now? You want to kill me?
Kill me! Kill me too! I haven't found a single moment of
happiness from you in this entire life, - not even a moment.
- Happiness? Happiness? You've taken everything from me.
What do I have now that I can give you? You want happiness? Your control over my property.
You have everything! You never even dreamed
that you'd have all of this! Enough, Dad! Enough! I'm ashamed. I've come back after such a long time
and your behavior is the same with her! - Son, she--
- I won't hear a single word against her. If you don't speak to her respectfully... then I will leave this house myself. But I'll take her with me.
We'll live in some other house. Son, you don't know this woman.
She's a very sharp and clever woman-- I told you I don't want to hear
another word. Don't you get it? She's my mother! I only say this to you, please, Dad... speak to them with respect and calmness,
because if you don't... then I won't ever see your face again. I've gotten used to this behavior from him. In all of these days, not a single day
pass when he didn't taunt me with this. Why does he even taunt you
about your status? People aren't big
because of their status, they're big because
of their character and... I've learned it all from you. He hates people with a lower status. He also thinks that I married him
for his money. - It's not like that though, Shahzar.
- Why are you explaining it to me? I know full well that
there's nothing like that. And trust me, no one understands you
more than me in this house. I can't change the way he thinks, but... I have this request of you that... don't put yourself down
because of the things he says. No, he's being stubborn. He says if
he married someone, it'll only be her. He has asked me to take his proposal. Just say no straight up.
There's such a good proposal in the family. So what's the point to establishing
a relationship with strangers? And besides, your niece Romana, that poor girl is an orphan
and also destitute. Ammi, I don't want to say no like this
and look bad in his eyes. You know how hard I've worked to achieve
this status in this house and family. You were saying he's very obedient
and compliant. What is this issue then? The situation here is
completely the opposite. You yourself stay subdued by him. Oh, no. It's not like that. I don't want to say no like this
and make him wary of me. I don't want to ruin
everything that I've done. I'll take the proposal there. I'll see who are the people, how are they. It's possible that I'll like the girl. Yes, how your husband is simple,
she'll be like that too. And how many times have I told you
to get your share in the property. Get it on your name but no.
You don't listen. You don't worry about me so much. Sleep now. God. Oh, Mehru, answer me at least. What do I say to Mr. Manzoor?
He wants to come over in a few days. Umar... you should say no to them. Just tell them that... Rameen said no. Why? He's such a nice guy. I agree! He's a good guy, the family is good,
the proposal is also very good, but... Your daughter likes someone. What? Look, Mehru, you know that it's
the most important decision of my life. How can I just marry her off to any
random man that she brings over? I'm sorry! This marriage isn't possible.
No matter what! Umar... our daughter has grown up now. She knows what's good for her
and what's not. And her consent is very important
in her marriage. And I want to tell you that the guy comes
from a really nice family background, and he has done civil engineering,
he got his degree abroad. Civil engineering? Thank God he's an educated guy. Tell me more about his family. I have faced a lot of torment
since marrying this woman. I mean, she never misses
an opportunity to belittle me. Tell me what happened now? Didn't you see? Without telling me,
without asking for my opinion, she has gone to fix my son's marriage. Shahnawaz, she's only gone to see the girl
for now. She'll ask us both
before finalizing the proposal. She doesn't deem us worthy of it. She's the queen of this house.
She wants to control everything. Have you not seen how Shahzar
keeps praising her virtues? Look, she has been manipulating
Shahzar like a puppet since childhood. It's nothing new.  -You torment yourself for no reason.
- So what else do I do? I... I don't want to be a spectacle
of my own helplessness. Enough! It's enough! I can't tolerate it anymore. Look, Shahnawaz, there's one thing. She might not be a good wife,
but she is a good mother. She has raised your children as her own. You'll have to accept it. That woman must have
some agenda behind this too. She knows it really well that my son
is the sole heir of my property. 21 years! I've been tolerating that woman
for 21 years! I've come to know every aspect of her
in these 21 years. She won't even offer someone a glass
of water without an agenda. She can't love anyone! This is all your fault. You're completely fine.
Take care of your business. Why did you include your wife 
in your business? It's not my fault, Aapa. It's your fault. You forced me for a second marriage. You wished for Tabinda, I did.
She was your choice. I was never in favor of this. You forced me to take this bitter sip. Rameen was telling me you're a business
woman and you're a homemaker too. She was really praising you. Just... After my husband's accident, 
I had to do it. But he's here now. He's handle everything. But I'm not interest in
Dad's business at all. I've decided to sit in for CSS exams.
I'm preparing for that. That's so commendable that today's
generations want to do something themselves. Auntie, please do have some brownies.
I baked them myself. Really? Okay. Then I'll have to taste it. The brownies are really good! - Really?
- Oh, you have a sweet tooth? Yeah, I do. It's tasty. What does your husband do? He has a business that he looks after. Actually we've shifted here from
Islamabad a few months back. - From Islamabad?
- Yes. Right. I'm sorry. Actually, 
I told him you're coming, I think his meeting ran late.
He's on the way, he's coming. I understand.
It happens. It's not a big deal. - No problem!
- Oh, Baba! You're here! - I know I'm late. I'm so sorry!
- Baba, we waited so long for you. Umar, this is Tabinda. This is Shahzar. - Salam, Uncle.
- And Shahzar's sister, Manal.
