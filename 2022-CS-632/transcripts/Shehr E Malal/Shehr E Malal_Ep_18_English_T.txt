[13.81] Kamran can't do this.
[17.54] How can he leave me
and marry someone else?  No, no.
[22.91] But there is something...
[25.88] What if someone is poisoning her mind
against me?
[28.37] Someone is turning her against me?
[31.12] Sir, pleasure working with you.
[33.14] This company doesn't feel like I'm working
elsewhere, it's almost like a family.
[38.82] That's good, that's really good.
[42.44] Anyway, your dedication...
[46.60] and your style of working,
[51.12] - it has really impressed me.
-Thank you, sir.
[53.98] You've probably met the
rest of the staff already,
[57.13] but today you'll meet Mr.  Rizwan too.
[60.97] In fact, he's our Finance Manager.
[65.10] Yes, fair enough.  Thank you, sir.
[69.42] - Come, come.
-Good morning, sir.
[71.54] -Hello, Mr.  Omar.
- Please.
[74.32] Rizwan, sit.
[76.95] I was just talking about you
with Mr.  Omar.
[80.72] Mr.  Umar, meet Mr.  Rizwan.
[103.62] Did you talk to Mr.  Rizwan?
[105.47] Yes, I did.  In fact, he just came
back from vacation yesterday.
[110.51] We spoke in detail.
[114.06] Did you explain everything properly to him?
[118.53] Of course, I explained everything.
[120.25] He even promised that
within the next two months,
[124.99] he'll trap Mr.  Umar
in an embezzlement case.
[127.66] And tell him he will be rewarded very well
for it.  Don't worry.
[131.97] I had already mentioned this to him, that's
why everything else is moving forward.
[136.24] anything else?  Any updates?
[139.16] Anything else...Yes!
Important update.  I forgot.
[143.22] The update is Mrs.  Umar has quit her job
at the factory.
[149.20] I mean, she has resigned.
[151.74] She had to.
[152.99] With her husband getting such a good job,
what does she need that low-paying job for?
[158.15] And the project from the Dawood Group?
[161.34] Yes, Mr.  Shahzar is working very hard
on that project, with a lot of dedication.
[167.24] I've already handed
over all the files to him.
[192.09] -Hello!  -Kamran
speaking.
[197.97] Ka- Kamran!
[200.23] Why are you calling
from a different number?
[203.74] I'm calling from a friend's phone
[207.37] to tell you that...
[210.41] the chapter of you in
my life is closed now.
[213.60] You don't mean anything to me.
[217.61] My mother must have told you.
[220.55] I'm getting married,
and I've already found a girl.
[225.78] You're such a scoundrel!
You are a pathetic person!
[229.79] I did everything for you!
[232.91] I picked you up from the ground
and put you in the sky,
[234.77] and this is how to repaid me?
[239.78] I will not forgive you.
[242.75] I'll go to your home
[244.40] and tell your relatives
everything you've done to me.
[251.56] I'll tell them how you came into Tabinda
Khala's house and married her daughter,
[254.31] and how you robbed their house too.
I'll tell them everything!
[256.03] I'll tell them every single thing you did!
[258.33] If you open your mouth, I'll ruin you.
[264.37] You've already ruined me.
[267.83] But listen, Kamran Ahmed.
[271.11] I won't forgive you so easily.
[274.98] I won't let you get away.
[278.41] I won't let you get
away with this betrayal.
[281.76] You understand, right?
[282.88] So go and do whatever you want.
But remember one thing.
[288.42] People in my family will never lose trust a
character girl like you.
[293.13] Who would want you as a daughter-in-law?
[297.35] A girl like me?
[298.74] Look, I don't want to argue anymore.
[302.90] This is the last time I'm calling you...
[305.55] just to tell you not to wait for me.
[310.61] I am never coming back to Pakistan.
[313.71] Goodbye.
[339.61] You...
[342.07] can't do this to me.
[345.30] You don't know...
[348.41] You don't know who has betrayed you.
[359.60] what is this?
[362.47] What is this madness?  What happened to you?
[366.56] It... it...
[369.60] It slipped by mistake.
[372.60] Control your hands.
Clean this up as soon as possible.
[376.58] Come on!
[378.92] She has lost her mind.
[387.44] She was fine in the morning.  -What
[389.39] happened to her in the evening?
- I don't know.
[392.00] She's acting weird.
I don't know what happened to her.
[396.62] Strange.
[398.08] Did she say anything to you?
[399.72] I tried asking her,
but she didn't say anything.
[403.18] I don't know what happened to her.
[404.47] Now that Minal is doing better,
she has started acting strange.
[408.16] I think it's something to do with a boy
[411.45] You're 100% right.
[414.00] She's had a couple of affairs before too.
[417.72] Oh, I told you, right?
[420.13] I always suspected her behavior.
[423.98] I told you not to keep her here.
But you didn't listen to me.
[427.85] Send her away now.
[429.20] What I brought her here for, she
didn't do that.  She's completely useless!
[433.65] She doesn't do anything
at the office either.
[435.09] She's only making money.
Just taking salary.
[437.36] And I don't like her hanging out
with Minal too much.
[440.33] It's her who filled Minal's head
with rubbish too.
[442.94] Seems that way.
[444.47] I'm telling you, take her by the
hand and throw her out immediately.
[448.81] It's a new drama everyday.
[451.12] You are right.
[459.42] He's living a luxurious life in Dubai
as a millionaire because of my plan.
[464.47] He is giving the happiness I deserve
to someone else.
[468.32] What did I get even after doing so much?
[470.84] Nothing.
[474.87] I am left with nothing.
[478.05] If Khala kicks me out
and sends me to Hyderabad,
[483.52] I might even lose this job.
[488.73] What do I do?
[490.50] What do I do?  I'm so lost.
[505.24] I can't understand.
[506.93] The person who ruined my life, his daughter
is living her best life in my home!
[511.24] I can't do anything.
[512.85] You need to make Shahzar hate Rameen.
[516.57] Fill his heart with so much hatred
that he is compelled to leave her.
[521.85] But no, you're focused on
Umar, his job, and business.
[526.97] How do you think Umar has
reached where he is today?  Because of me!
[532.25] I won't rest until I get him behind bars.
[535.94] Look at that girl!
She's so happy with Shahzar.
[541.00] And look at our poor Minal.
[543.41] She is just sitting here
after being betrayed.
[546.43] She's so young.
[548.43] Betrayal is all that is written in the fate
of you mother and daughter.
[551.84] , Umar left you for wealth...
[555.55] and my daughter is
stuck in this situation.
[559.58] I won't spare Kamran.
[561.28] I will make him regret
this for the rest of his life.
[563.93] You forget about him for now.
[565.79] Shahzar told me about Rameen's illness
in passing.
[570.93] What illness?
[584.47] He didn't tell me about it.
[586.47] He mentioned it to me
because you were at the office.
[590.40] I think she might be expecting.
[595.60] No, that's not possible.
[597.85] If it were true,
Shahzar would have told me first.
[601.99] -No, it's not like that.  -Come
on!
[606.45] It's your drama.  What can I do?
[616.11] Listen.
[619.25] Yes.  yes, Khala?
[621.97] Pack your things and get ready to leave.
[626.77] But, why?  Where will I go?
[631.08] Your house.  what else?
[633.25] But what's my mistake, Khala?
What have I done wrong?
[636.57] It's not your fault, it's mine
that I trusted you so blindly.
[642.85] The task I called you for didn't happen.
So what's the point of sitting here idly?
[649.44] But at least tell me what's my fault?
What mistake did I make?
[652.62] Why did I call you here?
what was your task?
[656.34] Your task was to create a rift
between Rameen and Shahzar.
[659.44] And what did you do?  The results are zero.
[662.12] Then what is the point of sitting here
and doing nothing?
[667.81] And who's the guy you've been crying about?
[673.16] Which...which guy?  Well, I don't know.
[676.86] I know girls like you very well.
[679.21] I can't take responsibility
for you anymore.
[682.07] I don't know who it is that you're having an
affair with.
[684.48] If you ran away with him, what am
I going to say to your family?
[687.68] No, Khala, I won't do anything like that.
Trust me.
[691.19] - I won't do anything like that.
-I don't trust anything you say.
[694.90] Khala, you-- you--
[696.54] I'm begging you, Khala.
[698.44] Please don't do this to me, Khala.
Where will I go?
[701.08] - I'll do whatever you say.  -Talk
softly.
[704.14] Please don't send me away from here, Khala.
Where will I go?
[708.72] If you want to live in this house,
so you'll have to stay within your limits.
[712.59] You'll have to stay away from Minal.
[718.21] I can't tolerate Rameen anymore.
[721.19] I want Shahzar to humiliate her
and throw her out himself!
[726.41] You have to make that happen.
[727.81] Okay, I will do it.
But what am I supposed to do?
[731.12] I am going to the office now.  You
need to be there too.  We'll talk later.
[734.40] Fine, I'll meet you there.
[743.11] This is a risky job.
You have to be very careful.
[746.84] I hope you won't disappoint me.
[749.89] Keep this in your bag.
[751.59] What?  what's this?
[778.48] wow touch wood.
[783.70] - Salam!
- Rameen!
[786.73] Oh my god!
[789.78] May you live long.
What a pleasant surprise!
[793.20] Is everything okay?  How do you think
your mother is so early in the morning?
[796.29] I only come here because I miss you.
[798.64] Otherwise I always have to cancel my plans
because of Baba.
[801.48] Anyway, what were you doing?
[804.20] Such a beautiful flower has grown out.  Did
you see it?
[806.73] I was just watering the plants
and then I'll prepare lunch.
[810.29] You're staying for lunch, right?
[811.83] Your grandmother went to buy vegetables.
She'll be so happy when she returns!
[814.91] Mama, I have to leave, but I
wanted to talk to you about something.
[819.02] But you have to promise
that you won't tell Baba.
[822.82] - Rameen, are you all right?
- I'm completely fine!
[825.72] Then?
[826.26] Just promise me you won't tell me Baba.
It's something about his job.
[831.57] About his job?
[836.85] What happened?  Please...
[840.12] don't worry too much.
[843.15] It's just that Baba's ego is so massive
[847.34] that he doesn't accept anyone's help
nor is he able to do anything for himself.
[853.33] Please don't talk in riddles.
[855.20] Frankly tell me what you're trying to say.
[858.11] The job he's showing off about these days,
my mother-in-law made it happen.
[863.16] Because his own reputation is so bad
that no one wants to employ him.
[870.68] I just want to correct your misconception
that he got the job on merit.
[875.05] No, that's not true.
[884.15] Why did your mother-in-law do this?
[887.61] Do you have any idea...
[890.09] that if your father is found out,
he'll resign immediately!
[894.11] So please don't tell him then.
[896.64] This has to stay between us.
[900.40] I wish you didn't tell me either.
[902.50] Ammi, I can't shoulder such
a big burden all on my own.
[918.42] Your main task is
[919.87] to create misunderstandings
and rifts between Shahzar and Rameen.
[924.59] - Do you understand?
- Yes, Khala.
[928.61] You're close to me, you're my family,
I can only trust you.
[934.08] This is a risky job,
you'll have to be careful.
[937.92] I hope you won't disappoint me.
[940.72] Oh, no, no, Khala.  I am loyal to you.
[943.68] I can't even imagine betraying you.
You don't worry.
[947.32] Okay, keep this in your bag.  -What
[950.62] ...what is this?  -These
are the birth control pills.
[957.53] You have to give them to Rameen
every carefully without her knowing
[961.95] because I don't want Rameen
and Shahzar to have kids.
[965.86] So what?  Is she about to become a mother?
[969.03] Oh no.  This is why we have to give her
these pills.
[973.74] do you understand me?  You're
gonna have to do this very carefully.
[977.56] Nobody should find out.
[981.52] Okay, all right.
[985.47] Should I go?
[1011.74] Baba has such a massive ego
[1014.11] that he doesn't accept anyone's help
nor is he able to help himself.
[1020.08] The job he's showing off about these days,
my mother-in-law made it happen.
[1024.62] Because his own reputation is so bad
that no one wants to employ him.
[1032.19] I just want to correct your misconception
that he got the job on merit.
[1036.57] No, that's not true.
[1043.56] Why is Tabinda doing all of this for us?
[1047.35] Why is she doing so many favors to us?
[1050.86] What is the reason behind this?
[1053.52] First, she kept insisting on employing Umar
in her company.
[1057.98] When he didn't agree to that,
she referred him to Mr.  Baqar.
[1062.58] As far as I know her...
[1065.81] Tabinda isn't a soft hearted woman,
nor does she have a big heart.
[1074.16] Then why is she bestowing so many favors
on Umar?
[1078.70] Maybe because of Rameen.
[1085.59] Omar.  When did you get home?
[1088.62] I just came back a little while ago.
Ammi was telling me Rameen was here?
[1092.40] Yes, she was here.
[1095.23] So did you tell her about my job?
[1099.12] Yes, I told her.  She was very relieved
and very excited too
[1103.80] that you've finally got a job, touch wood.
[1110.04] You should've asked her to stay.
[1111.51] I told her, I insisted that she stay, but
she had to go somewhere, that's why...
[1118.22] You go and fresh up, I'll make tea for you.
[1131.68] what are you hiding?
[1134.03] Is something the matter?
[1137.56] Have I ever hidden
anything from you before?
[1141.42] It's nothing.
[1170.28] Listen to me carefully.
[1174.79] Give Rameen this medicine
daily, mixed in juice or milk.
[1180.02] And it has to be done daily!  Do you understand?
[1185.05] This is a very difficult task
you're asking me to do.
[1187.53] Oh man!  You're going to get paid
for this too.
[1191.36] No, no.  I can't do this.
Please ask someone else to do this.
[1194.91] I cannot commit this crime.
[1196.38] You're acting as if I'm asking you
to give her poison.
[1200.30] Don't worry.
[1201.37] This medicine will not have any effects
on Rameen's health.
[1204.40] Although it would thwart Mr.  Shahzar's
dreams of becoming a father.
[1211.27] -Come on, do this.
- But...
[1216.40] don't worry.
[1220.38] Keep it.
[1224.78] You can't even think about the
money you're gonna get for this.
[1228.14] Just make sure that no one finds out
about this in the house.
[1233.62] do you understand?
[1236.67] Come on, go.
[1245.16] Poor Shahzar.
[1254.25] Yes, child, I heard you were unwell.
[1257.87] Oh, there's nothing to worry about.
Just had a minor dizzy spell.
[1263.18] One second.  Were you feeling dizzy?
[1267.29] Oh my God!  You know, it's not bad
for newly married women to feel this way.
[1272.72] It's a good thing, actually.
[1276.95] -What do you mean?
-I think you're pregnant.
[1281.82] Why don't you come over?
I'll take you to a gynecologist.
[1288.51] Can I come over to you right now?
[1290.91] Yes, of course!
[1294.38] - I'm coming right over.  Wait for me.
- Okay!
[1307.94] I brought fresh juice for you.
[1310.60] Why don't you knock before you come in?
[1312.69] And you gave me fresh juice in the morning,
you've brought it again.
[1316.81] Mr.  Shahzar has told me to
give you fresh juice thrice a day.
[1321.66] And if you don't drink it, I'm
supposed to make you drink it myself.
[1328.99] Give it here.
[1334.40] Okay, you can go.
[1338.52] And please knock before you come in.
[1382.80] -Oh, where are you going?
-I was just going to meet Mama.
[1386.20] But you were unwell.  You should rest.
[1389.57] No, actually, I was tired of resting.
[1392.27] Then Mama called that she was going
for shopping, so I thought I would join her.
[1395.69] Do you have any objections?
[1397.95] No, no.  Why would I object?
[1400.37] I can't stop you from coming
and going anywhere.
[1403.46] But, look.  For me, you and Minal
are the same.
[1409.57] Whatever I say, it's for your own good.
[1414.34] You've just got married, and I
feel it's my duty to guide you.
[1419.35] Now you're a part of this house,
[1422.18] and with this relationship,
you have some responsibilities.
[1426.73] Right?
[1427.56] You are the daughter-in-law of this house,
Shahzar's wife.
[1431.95] Now...
[1434.66] it doesn't look good to go to
your parents' house every day.
[1437.83] This is your home now;
you should take care of it too.
[1440.86] This house has some rights for you too.
[1444.29] -Mom, that's true.
-Now don't say you get bored.
[1447.04] No woman ever gets bored in her own home.
[1449.05] You'll have kids soon, God is willing,
you know how much Shahzar likes kids.
[1452.92] You won't even have a single minute
to step out of the house.
[1456.54] Take care of yourself.
[1458.44] I think you should rest.
It's better if you stay home.
[1476.04] I've done her thorough check-up,
I've also gotten a pregnancy test done.
[1480.43] But she's not expecting at the moment.
[1486.78] But her blood pressure is very high.
[1489.00] I think she's under a lot of stress and
she's not taking care of her diet either.
[1492.80] I'm prescribing some multivitamins to her.
Please make sure she takes them.
[1497.61] Also, try to give her some mental peace.
[1500.41] Sometimes, mental stress
and pressure can delay pregnancy.
[1504.36] But there's no need to worry;
[1506.30] we have couples who haven't
had children for 6-7 years.
[1510.63] Just have faith in God.
[1514.84] Mr.  Umar, I've checked the quotations,
and I need your signature.
[1534.22] I was so excited to hear
about your pregnancy and then...
[1538.45] Amma, what's there to worry about?
Didn't you hear what she said?
[1542.29] It's only been a little while since I got
married and you're already stressing out.
[1547.44] Yeah, Rameen.
[1549.39] But you know how everyone is so excited
for their children's children.
[1555.27] And I think that…
[1557.10] your position in that house will strengthen
once you have a child.
[1561.84] How did you come up with that?
[1564.23] Do you think I'm not happy in that house?
[1567.01] I don't know, Rameen.  Because
you are not sharing your feelings with me.
[1571.87] If you ask me, I've noticed that
since your marriage to Shahzar, I have
[1578.36] n't seen true happiness on your face
even once.
[1582.15] I don't understand why.
[1584.02] I don't understand what the tension is.
Even the gynecologist said that, right?
[1586.81] -One minute, Mama.
-No!
[1589.17] What is stressing you?
We got you married to Shahzar, right?
[1592.65] One second.
[1594.43] I am not stressed because of Shahzar
or his family.
[1597.35] Then why are you stressed, dear?
[1599.27] My stress is because
of your husband, Mr.  Omar.
[1602.54] It's his actions that
raise my blood pressure.
[1605.29] And now, because of his presence,
I can't even step into my own house.
[1608.74] Seeing his face makes me angry,
and that's why my blood pressure is high.
[1623.06] Sir, as you said, I've ordered the quotes,
[1625.29] and Mr.  Rizwan is
aware of everything too.
[1628.13] I want you to review them once
and then finalize the decision.
[1634.86] Mr.  Umar...
[1638.28] I don't have time to get
entangled in these matters.
[1643.17] This is a finance-related issue;
please discuss it with Mr.  Rizwan.
[1651.21] Sir, I told him the same thing.
[1652.78] I've checked the quotes, but I
think the previous one is better.
[1657.09] However, I want you to
make the final decision.
[1663.50] -Mr.  Omar, let me ask you something.
-Yes sir.
[1667.09] Do you have any doubts
about Mr.  Rizwan's loyalty?
[1673.85] No, sir.  Absolutely not.
[1675.62] If not, then go ahead
without any hesitation and fear,
[1679.75] and work based on Mr.  Rizwan's suggestions.  -All
[1683.16] right.  Very well, sir, very well.
-All right?
[1685.48] Done.  -Thank
[1686.11] you.  -Thank
you.
[1688.75] -You may go.
-Thank you, sir.
[1692.99] Whether you're hungry or not,
eating is very important.
[1695.19] Since when did your blood pressure
get so high?
[1697.92] It's pretty normal, Mom.
BP goes up and down.
[1701.74] We care about your health,
even if you don't.
[1705.69] After all, you are to carry forward
the name and lineage of this family.
[1709.36] Don't stress too much.
It's not good for you.  Huh?
[1713.51] Oh, so this is what the mother
and the daughter-in-law are talking about.
[1715.98] I was also thinking why is Mom so worried
about you these days.
[1718.92] I am already so excited.
I've started thinking of names too.
[1722.56] God knows what time will come.
[1723.99] Hopefully, soon.  I'll distribute sweets
in the entire city!
[1728.45] Sure, you can do that.
However, it's too late.
[1732.46] We'll go and you should sleep too.
[1736.02] Come on, come.  Good night.
[1776.86] How long has it been since your marriage?
[1779.59] Almost two years.
[1782.63] But in these two years, you haven't
shared any good news with us.
[1788.64] What?
[1793.29] Shahzar badly wants children.
[1795.99] Maybe he doesn't want to hurt you,
so he hasn't mentioned it,
[1799.45] but he keeps telling me,
he's even chosen names for the kids.
[1803.94] Not just Shahzar, but his father
also wants grandchildren.
[1807.20] I'm worried that their wish might
not be fulfilled in their lifetime.
[1812.07] I think you need to
think seriously about this.
[1816.99] Mom, not everything is under my control.
[1819.68] You're a woman, you understand how it goes.
[1822.95] I'm not blaming you for not having
children, I'm just trying to explain.
[1827.26] It's been two years since you got married.
Two years since you've been in this house,
[1829.41] but I feel like you've never considered
this house your own.
[1832.78] You live here like a guest.
[1836.07] Mom, that's not true.
You know I'm trying hard.
[1839.78] You haven't really tried, that
's the problem.
[1843.42] Ever since you got married,
[1846.46] you're always focused
on your parents' problems.
[1849.44] You're stuck in those issues,
[1851.12] and that's causing you so much stress
[1854.38] that you're neither happy yourself
nor keeping Shahzar happy.
[1859.88] I've noticed recently
that Shahzar seems upset.
[1864.98] Even at work, he's not fully engaged,
he doesn't feel like being at home either.
[1868.82] And I am sure his sadness
is because of you and your family.
[1874.02] Let's be honest, you know very well that...
[1876.97] he had to suffer humiliation
and embarrassment because of your father.
[1882.19] Now, I feel that if you
give him the joy of children,
[1887.22] maybe you can win back
his attention and love.
[1892.46] Don't let it happen that, as he grows more
distant from you, he finds someone else.
[1900.29] Mom, that will never happen.
I trust him completely.
[1905.16] A man's love is like changing seasons,
[1907.80] sometimes warm, sometimes cold.
My job was to explain this to you,
[1911.72] what you do after that is your choice.
[1931.85] Mr.  Umar, I have checked the quotations
and it is ready for your signature.
[1935.78] Sure, I'll sign this.  I...
[1939.24] Let me get done with this,
I'll give it to you by evening.
[1940.87] Oh no.  We need to
forward this order quickly.
[1943.18] But who will check it?
[1945.36] Mr.  Umar, Sir will check the final numbers.
I'm taking this file to him.
[1950.43] Really?
[1968.11] And one here too.
[1973.12] And that's it.
[1974.42] Please make sure to show this to Sir.
[1976.67] -Yes, sure.  -Do
take his approval.  -Thank
[1978.22] you.  -Thank
you.
[1996.28] I can't wait anymore.
[1997.90] My heart wants Umar
Hassan and his family to
[1999.90] be ruined and destroyed
right in front of my eyes.
[2002.57] I want him to fall so low in the
eyes of Rameen and Shahzar
[2006.22] that he can never raise his head again.
[2009.69] The time for revenge on
Umar Hassan has come.
[2013.34] I will talk to you later.
[2014.81] You will see him behind bars very soon.
[2018.45] Talk softly!  Talk softly.
what's wrong with you?
[2021.49] Shahnawaz has come to the office today.
[2023.47] I'm not that crazy!
[2025.06] He has gone out for a meeting
with his son.
[2028.88] Still, there are others at the office.
Anyway, tell me, what's the news today?
[2032.45] There is no report today.
[2034.53] There's just good news today,
just good news.
[2037.94] Tell me.
[2038.80] Everything is happening
just the way you wanted.
[2041.72] And the first strike against
Umar Hassan has been made.
[2045.44] Here's how it happened:
Umar Hassan signed a paper,
[2050.04] and a duplicate of his signature was made,
[2052.99] which was used on other legal documents.
[2057.71] Now you'll see how quickly Umar
Hassan gets trapped and ends up in jail.
[2076.22] Rameen, my love, stop for a second.
[2078.89] Stop crying.  You've been crying ever
since you came here.  Tell me what happened.
[2082.87] I have been having some very bad thoughts.
[2086.53] Please tell me what happened.
Did someone say something to you?
[2089.67] Mama, I can't believe it, I misjudged her
so much.
[2093.89] She's such a strange woman.
[2095.50] I mean, when she's good, she's perfect.
Like, there's no better person than her.
[2101.63] But sometimes she says such strange
things that one wonders what is going on.
[2106.66] Tell me, love,
what did she say this time?
[2109.12] The same taunts about being childless.
[2112.47] If I can't have children, what's my fault?
[2116.85] Has she lost her mind?
Such a stupid thing to say!
[2119.84] She is an educated woman,
yet she is talking like illiterate people.
[2122.74] You should've told her
what the gynecologist has said.
[2125.93] That you're perfectly fine,
there's nothing wrong with you.
[2128.75] It's just stress, and God is willing, when
you are happy, the good news will come.
[2135.72] By the way, Rameen...
[2137.84] I've told you many times
that our problems are not your problems!
[2141.78] You take everything to your heart,
upon your mind.
[2145.43] That's why you have so much tension.
She's right.
[2149.43] She also keeps saying that I take
tensions from here home with me.
[2153.47] She says in the last two years, I haven't been
able to give Shahzar any happiness.
[2157.97] Plus, she's adding more pressure on my head
that we want a grandson!
[2163.32] Our heir.  is that something to say?
[2166.67] And she’s creating a conflict between me
and Shahzar.
[2169.43] That no, Shahzar wants children,
but he doesn't say anything to me
[2172.21] because I fight with him.
[2174.05] So show it to Shahzar,
you have the evidence.
[2176.68] Show him the gynecologist's report
that see, I'm not lying.
[2180.45] I mean, you're perfect.  Tell him to go
and get tested.
[2184.51] Amma, what are you saying?
[2186.66] I mean, they want an heir, right?
You're perfectly fine, 100% normal.
[2191.41] So maybe he has a problem.
She should take her son and get him tested.
[2194.75] Seriously, Mama?
[2196.89] You know very well that my relationship
with Shahzar is already very risky.
[2202.49] He's looking for an excuse to fight with
me, and now you're creating more problems.
[2207.27] But all I'm saying is that they want
an heir, a son,
[2210.53] and since you're not expecting,
they're saying--
[2212.11] R... Rameen!  Rameen, I didn't mean to like
that!
[2215.59] -Oh!
- Rameen, I didn't mean it...
[2219.46] Our daughter is here today.  See!
[2222.74] Parents already know.  They can smell
their daughters from a mile away!
[2227.88] I knew you'd be coming today, that's why I
brought your favorite cheesecake.
[2231.58] We'll sit together, have tea, eat cake,
and talk!
[2237.44] - Rameen!
-What?
[2239.20] I... I'll come and tell you.  Rameen!
Dear!
[2244.34] Rameen, please!
[2255.01] Don't beat me around the bush.
Come to the point!
[2258.59] I can help you in catching Kamran.
[2261.81] But on one condition.
[2263.46] Doctors are saying
there is no point in getting her treatment.
[2267.31] But still, if you insist, we can...
[2271.49] The treatment they'll do now
is very expensive.
[2273.69] You'll get your money tomorrow.
[2276.36] I am not doing this in greed
for money, Khala.
[2280.01] then what do you want?
[2282.80] Shahzar.
