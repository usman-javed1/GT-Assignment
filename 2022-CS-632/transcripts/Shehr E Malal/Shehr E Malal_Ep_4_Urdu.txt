I’m really sorry to say this,
I didn't want to, but I have to. You are an extremely self-centered,
ungrateful, and selfish person. That's why I've made a decision. As soon as the morning comes,
I’m leaving this house. Dear, forget about this guy. We've already fixed your engagement
with Arshad, Mr. Mazoor's son. They’re coming in two days
for the formal engagement. Baba, why are you doing this to me? First, you rejected Shahzar's proposal, and then when he came
to your office to talk to you, you insulted him and threw him out. You had every right to reject him,
but who gave you the right to insult him? Lower your voice and speak.
Don’t forget that I am your father. You are forcing me. He left his home for my sake,
and look at how you are treating him. What should I do and what I should not do,
you don’t need to explain that to me. His father is not happy with this proposal, how can I send you to a house
where you will be the reason for stress? Why can’t you understand this? Apart from the boy, whoever you tell, whenever you tell,
I will get you married to them-- No, no, no, no! You're not rejecting this proposal
because of his parents; you're rejecting it because you want
me to marry someone richer than him. - Rameen!
- Stop it! I’m very disappointed. I could never have imagined that my father
could be this selfish and materialistic. You are choosing money
over your daughter’s happiness. - Ram--
- What’s wrong with Shahzar? What does he lack? People are right about him. He doesn't see anything beyond money. Every has always told me
that he married you for money. Shut up, Rameen! Be quiet! You’re not even ashamed, are you? How dare-- How dare you talk
about your father-- - How dare you--
- Mehru! - How dare you--
- Enough. - How dare-- Dare--
- Come, come with me. How can she even think like that? That's it. Did you take your medicine? I'm sorry, Mehru. I'm extremely sorry. In these 22 years,
I could never give you any happiness. I'm not just a failed businessman, but... I'm also failed husband
and a failed father. Please. Please don't embarrass me
by saying this like these. I am one who's ashamed of myself... ashamed in front of you,
ashamed in front of my daughter. Didn't you see? She said the same thing
that people have always said about me. It’s people’s job to talk nonsense. The whole world knows that for the past 20 years, you invested all
the business profits into my treatment. If they still say these things, so... let them. I had complete trust in you then
and I have complete trust in you now. Today, I have felt the
failure of mine very intensely. Today I found out that success
is measured through wealth. in status, in honor. What did I achieve? I think of myself... as the luckiest woman in the world. Don’t talk like this, it disturbs me. Drink water. So... Don't even wait for tomorrow,
just stop worrying from today. You rest. Bhai! You're back. Mom? Mom! Mom, see! Bhai is back. Phuppo! - Phuppo, Bhai is back!
- He's back? Shahzar? You're back? Thank God! You're back otherwise your mother and I
were going to bring you back. - The house was empty without you.
- I was really missing you. - There was no one here to bother me.
- Shahzar! I'm so glad you're back. You did the right thing by coming back.
We... we were all so worried. It's okay. Everything's fine. It's good that you're back. Rest now. They will be here in a little while. Get ready and come down. You will meet them properly, and in your conversation, you will not
show any involvement with anyone else. When I first saw your son,
I liked him immediately. We also saw Rameen's photo and decided
that she was the right one for Arshad. If they meet and talk,
I don’t foresee any issues with that. Yes, I think it's very important. Before getting married, the man and woman should spend time
together to build mutual understanding. I could hardly resist the urge to bring
the engagement ring with me today. This engagement and the ring,
they are just formalities, but the important thing is this:
you just think that Rameen is yours. Now this calls for a sweet treat! - Sure, why not!
- I'll get the sweets. Yes. - I don't see Rameen anywhere.
- What happened-- I’ll call her. You should've brought your son along too. 
It would've been good if the kids to met. Madam! - Something terrible has happened.
- What’s happened? - Rameen...
- What’s happened to Rameen? - Tell me!
- What happened? - Why aren't you saying anything?
- Sir... Miss Rameen is unconscious in her room. - Quickly  go and check on her!  
- Move! Rameen! - Rameen! Rameen?
- Child? Rameen! - Ra-- Rameen!
- Quickly call the ambulance. - Rameen!
- Rameen! Easy, easy. God! Ra-- Rameen. Yes? I have some news about Umar Hassan
and his family. What? What kind of news? Yes... His daughter has attempted suicide, 
and she's at the hospital right now. - Really?
- Yes. My informer said Umar Hassan was trying to
arrange her marriage without her consent. And all of this happened in reaction 
to that. - How's her condition?
- Very bad. Her condition is very critical. 
I don’t think she will survive. Where is the hospital? Doctor. Doctor, my child. - What... what has happened to her? 
- Look, this is a suicide case, and in such cases, we have to inform 
the police for a proper investigation. But since your daughter’s condition is
critical, we started the treatment. Ger stomach is being washed,
and generally, it takes some time. If she regains consciousness by morning, 
she will survive. Otherwise… Otherwise? Look, we are doing everything we can, but mentally, you need to be prepared 
for any news. No, Doctor... - That's it, that's it.
- My daughter... That's it. Nothing will happen. 
Our daughter will be fine. I am sure of it. Everything will be fine, God willing. That's it, sweetheart, that's it. Yes, tell me, what's the latest news 
from the hospital? The doctors are washing her stomach now,
they are trying their best to save her. Okay, do one thing: leak this news to all the newspapers,
the press, and all the bloggers. It’s a difficult task
you've asked me to do. Because you know that Umar
Hassan is a very influential man, and he will try to suppress this
using his contacts. If you say yes, I will try to
spread this news within his family. Just do what I tell you. Don’t worry about who knows whom.
Understand? I want this news on the TV! And once the news leaks, it's hard to stop.
Just do as I say. - Okay, all right.
- Thank you. This is all because of you. My daughter was forced into this
situation because of your stubbornness. If anything happens to her... I will never forgive you. Get ahold of yourself, Mehru. I'm sorry. I never imagined that my daughter... could go this far for that boy. Our Rameen was so full of life. She loved her life. How could she end her life like this? How? How could she do this? Didn’t she think 
about what it would do to us? What pain will her parents go through? Umar, go. Go and talk to the doctor
to do everything to save our daughter. I'll die if something happened 
to her, Umar. - Go, go!
- Okay. Tell him... What happened, doctor? The doctors have done the stomach wash, and, God willing, she will regain
consciousness in a few hours. - Thank God!
- She is out of danger now. and we should be able to discharge her
by tomorrow. Mr. Umar, I need to talk to you 
about something important. Yes, go ahead. Look, I’ve done my best to keep this
from reaching the press or the police, but someone from the hospital
management leaked the information. The press will be here in a few minutes.
They will talk to you and your wife. Press? - Yes.
- Look, doctor, please do something. You know how much I trust
you and your hospital, which is why I brought my daughter
here. Please do something. I’ve tried my best, but sometimes, 
situations are beyond our control. I understand your grief, Mr. Umar,
but unfortunately, I cannot help you any further. You’ll have to handle the press yourself. Umar, you have many contacts,
ask someone you know for help-- Sit. What do you think.... I didn’t do all that? But... what can I do? We'll be dishonored. I understand. You've done another foolish thing! I told you to check with your mother 
before taking such a step! Oh, I thought you would be happy, 
but you’re getting angry. You're asking for trouble,
that's what you're doing. You've a brilliant mind. You're smart
and intelligent but no. You’ve made a mess of everything yourself. Shahzar finally came home, and now after hearing about that girl,
he will run away and never come back. You’re right. I didn’t think
about it like that, but anyway... It’s not too late. 
You can still stop your manager. What will you get 
by ruining Umar Hassan’s name? It'll give me peace and happiness. I want him to be disgraced. 
I want his whole family to be ruined, so much that he won’t be able
to show his face to anyone. He will be so humiliated that he will have
no choice but to leave not only the city but the entire country. That’s what I want. The rest of Shahzar's problems can wait.
Nothing will happen. His daughter is struggling 
between life and death, and that is punishment enough for him. And yes. Don’t do anything rash
just to comfort your heart. Tell me, why did your daughter 
attempt suicide? I don’t know. What can I say? 
She’s a child... What if she had some disagreements
with your or your wife? No, no. What are you saying? How
can children disagree with their parents? Just understand that we never
expected her to take such an extreme step. Everything seemed fine. If everything was fine, why did she
feel the need to take such a drastic step? I heard that on the day of the incident, some people came to your house 
to discuss the proposal. Yes, right. Is it possible that your
daughter liked someone else, and... you were forcing her 
into a marriage with someone else? No, no. We are not the kind of parents.
We-- Please forgive us. In such cases, 
this kind of thing happens. All right, what exactly are you trying 
to ask? Look, suicide is a criminal offense, and anyone who attempts it, 
they're punished, so they think carefully before doing it. For now, I am not filing
an FIR under suicide against your daughter, but once she regains consciousness, please
inform me so I can take her statement. Yes, yes, we will. Thank you very much. Thank you. - Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse me, sir. Are you the father of Rameen Hassan,
admitted in room number 101? - Who are you? 
- This is Mr. Umar Hassan, take a picture. One minute. What’s your problem? 
There's no need to take a picture. We've reports that tour daughter 
attempted suicide, We've come to take your and your
daughter's statement regarding this matter. Look, whatever you've heard-- Listen to me. Whatever you've heard is wrong.
There's nothing like that! - No comments! 
- Sir, please! Please! - I don't have any comments.
- Sir? But sir? Sir! -  I don't have any comments.
- Sir, please! Sir! Sir! Sir! - Sir! Sir, tell us something.
- Please, sir. Please! Sir! Sir! This was the father of Rameen Hassan, 
Umar Hassan, whose daughter has just attempted suicide. We tried to speak to them, 
but he preferred not to respond. Now, what is the truth and what
is the lie, we'll keep you updated. Stay tuned to XYZ News. What do you think, sweetheart? I didn't
try to explain, I didn't talk to him? - He's not listening. 
- I knew you'd say this. You spent your entire life with
your head bowed in front of Baba. You never took a stand for me. Give me some time, I'll talk again, 
I promise you. You won't do anything now 
because you can't do anything. Whatever I do now, I will do it myself. We have reports that your daughter
tried to commit suicide. We wanted to take your and your
daughter's statements regarding this. Whatever you've heard-- Listen to me.
Whatever you've heard is wrong. - There's nothing like that.
- Sir-- Sir? - I don't want to talk about this matter.
- Sir? Sir? - Sir, wait. Sir?
- Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Who ran this news on TV, Mom? Who else would do it? These media people are
always after spicy stories. They show up everywhere with a microphone. But in the city, hundreds of incidents 
happen every day. Why don't they go there with their mics? Shahzar is right. 
It’s all a conspiracy to defame us. Umar Hassan isn't famous enough for
the media to cover his family's news. Our name is being tarnished
along with Rameen's family. Let's see what kind of rumors
people will start spreading now. This girl attempted suicide 
only for Shahzar's sake. I can't believe this. That girl is right now struggling 
between life and death, and you’re only concerned about your name? Wealth, status, and name
are built with difficulty,  but it doesn’t take long to ruin them. Let’s see how people point fingers. This girl did it because of us! Not because of us. 
She did it because of you. You know very well that
everything happened because of you. If you had agreed, Rameen
would never have taken that step. Anyway, I... I'm going. - Where are you going?
- Hospital. Are you in your senses? I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to Mom. - Mom, please go with him. 
- How can I go? She’s in a critical condition. Fine. You don’t go then. I'll go myself. How can you go there in this situation? If you go, the media will come there, and
they’ll try to destroy our family’s name. I’ve told you, I don’t want to argue 
with you, Dad! Enough is enough. I'm going
and no one can stop me. Fine, I’m going with you. Fine, you get ready. 
I'll go get dressed too. Your daughter has regained consciousness. 
Thank God, the danger has passed. You can meet her now, but remember, don’t say anything that might put
any mental pressure on her. - Okay.
- All right? Okay. Thank you. How are you feeling? Rameen, I know you’re very angry with me, and you have every right to be angry. 
But what was I supposed to do, man? I can fight my dad 
and convince him any other way. But the things your dad said... I thought I wouldn’t be able 
to convince him. That's why I got tired 
and was disappointed. I had an idea that you were mad, but I didn’t think you were so crazy
that you would risk your life like this. Do you realize what would have
happened if something had happened to you? What would I have done? 
What would I have done? Thank God you’re fine. Don’t make such a face,
fix your expression. It’s already midnight... and we still haven’t
heard anything about them. I have all kinds of doubts in my heart. What if that girl dies? If she does, 
it’ll be a whole mess for us. Phuppo, I've been trying for so long. Mom's number is not connecting, 
and neither is Bhai's. It might be a network problem.
Please, keep trying. Aapa, pray that she survives. Otherwise, Shahzar will hold me responsible
for her death. He will never forgive me. If something happened to that girl... there could be a police case as well. - I have a reputation in this city.
- What kind of a person are you? The girl is in the hospital, and you’re
only concerned about your reputation. - Phuppo, pray that Rameen survives. 
- God willing, God willing, let’s hope. Hello, hello, Bhai? Is Rameen okay? Thank God! Rameen's fine. - She has regained consciousness. 
- Thank God. Okay, Bhai, please keep me updated.
Goodbye! - Thank God she survived!
- Thank God. Did they leave? They just left a while ago. You must be tired. I'll stay with Rameen. You should go home and rest. You need rest more than I do. You go home, rest, and I’ll get her discharged in the morning
and bring her home. What were you talking
to Shahzar’s mom about? You were talking to her
in the corridor for so long, I thought maybe you were talking
about Rameen and Shahzar's marriage. Come on! Is this the time 
to talk about marriage? Umar, I think you should stop being 
so stubborn now. Seriously think about their marriage. You're right. Whatever decision I make now... I'll make it with Rameen's consent. So, what were you talking 
to Shahzar’s mom about? Nothing special. Just... discussing not having a police case filed. She used her contacts to sort that out. You also have a lot of connections. 
within the police. I did. You know, Mehru, when a person falls 
from the sky to the ground... many of their people leave them. Yesterday, the people who were proud 
to stand by me... they don’t even want to talk to me today. Our situation isn’t that bad. What did Mr. Manzoor say? 
Did he contact you? Yes, he called. He insulted me very badly. He said, "If you knew 
what your daughter wanted, then why bother with a relationship 
with my son?" I wanted the ground to open up 
and swallow me. You know, when someone falls... instead of helping, 
people kick them further down... so they don’t have the strength 
to get back up. Right now, that’s what people are doing 
to us. But we won’t fall any further. Patience, courage. You have to stand up again, for yourself. I'm with you. I know. - I know you're with me.
- Always! Thank God the girl survived... otherwise my son would have made sure 
I was humiliated. Shahnawaz, why are you blaming Shahzar? Whenever anything happens, a fight starts, and accusations fly. Thank God her life was saved. 
Don’t let this case escalate. Shahzar spent the whole night 
at the hospital. This means there’s still some soft corner
in his heart for that girl. It's love, Shahnawaz. It'll take some time to move on. I think Shahzar will insist 
on marrying her again. his time, you won’t oppose him. As a sister, I order you 
to let Shahzar marry whoever he wants. Otherwise, you’ll regret it 
for the rest of your life. If he took a step like Rameen did, 
you’ll be left with nothing. - He’s your only child. 
- That’s true, but... what about the family? 
How will I face them? I don’t understand... I don’t understand why you’re
discussing this for so long. I want to marry Rameen, not her father. I am content to know 
that she’s an honorable girl. So don’t worry, no one will
harm your family’s honor. You think you’re very clever. What were you thinking?
That by turning Shahnawaz against Umar, you’ll save Shahzar’s life 
from those people? That’s a big mistake. Shahzar is very firm in his words 
and intentions. He will never change his decision. I’m already very worried. 
Don’t make things worse. I don’t want to trouble you. I’m just trying to warn you 
about the impending storm. I just want to tell you 
all your plans have failed. The situation is getting heated, and now Arfa is trying 
to convince her brother. And you know it very well that the
brother never goes against his sister. What do you want me to do? Should I give up and bring Umar’s daughter
into our house as my daughter-in-law? There’s no other choice. If Shahnawaz has agreed, 
you will have to respect his decision, or Shahzar will get away from you, and all your wealth and status 
will slip through your fingers. This isn’t about status or honor. The person who betrayed me, 
who broke my heart, who was unfaithful to me, 
who ruined my life... how will I be to see his daughter happy
and settled in my home? This is human nature. I know you’ve been burning 
with the fire of revenge for years, dear. And you won't get a better chance than this
to get your revenge. What do you mean? There is no better way to punish a greedy,
deceitful, and unfaithful person than this. Make his daughter as your daughter-in-law 
and make her suffer. I bet you this. To get his daughter married, he will come to you himself. he'll beg you,
and plead with you. He'll be on his knees! You'll see.
