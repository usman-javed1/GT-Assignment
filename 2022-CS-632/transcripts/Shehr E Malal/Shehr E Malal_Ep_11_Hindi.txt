- Thank you so much for everything, Mom.
- Thank you for what? I think it was my misunderstanding
that I was unable to understand you. I want all the details. I want to know what all he has left
and where he's applying for jobs. You're taking me lightly, right? I've already gathered all the details. And I've made a list, as well. This is the list all the multinational
companies he's applied to. I have my informants
in most of these countries. And where there are none,
it doesn't take long to place some there. He has an experience of 25 years.
That's not an ordinary thing. He can easily get a good job
anywhere. It's a mistake to think like that. I've made an entire strategy. Forget finding a job, he won't be able to show his face anywhere
in the city. I'll badmouth him so much in the city. Why do you worry? I'm here. I just... asked you for something. Come in, Bhai. Your bride is fully ready. Now you go and get ready as well.
Baba said you have to receive the guests. Bhai! I'm saying something to you. Yes, I'm listening.
What... what do I have to do? You're looking at Bhabi
as if you've seen her for the first time. Actually, this is the magic of makeup
and the dress, otherwise you know your bhabi. Don't you dare say anything
about my bhabi. My bhabi is the most beautiful. And
you're lucky to have such a beautiful wife. Yeah, that I'll figure out later, for now, you go so I can get ready.
You can sing your bhabi's praises later. Okay, I'll go. I'll go. I know you want privacy
and I'm bothering you. - You! You! Wrong thing you're saying.
- Okay, bye! Sorry! That's not fair! - You look nice today.
- Thank you. - And I'm also very happy.
- Why? Because... I've found you. Salam! Come, come. - Salam!
- You guys got so late. I've been waiting since so long.
Everybody's waiting for you. Rameen is also waiting.
Where were you? We were going to come at 7 pm,
but... They didn't send the car to you
with the driver? Shahzar said... I told Rameen to send the car to you,
get you picked. Rameen, I swear. She must've forgotten.
She wouldn't have remembered. They're busy in their own things. I'm so sorry you didn't get the car
and you had to come in a taxi. It's nothing like that.
We came very easily in a taxi. Yes, absolutely. Oh, Auntie, you must've travelled
in wagons and taxis. But this would be the first time
for Mehr-un-Nisa, no? She must've been inconvenienced. It's very wrong.
You could've just called me. I would've checked. You're treating us like strangers.
It's very wrong. I'll scold them why they didn't the car.
Come in, please. Come in. Please, please come. You didn't make us meet your in-laws. We've heard that you arranged for your
son to marry into a middle-class family. They belong to a good family, they're
just going through a business crisis. They nice, well-respected people. But some people are raising fingers
at Mr. Umar's reputation. And I've heard from someone that he committed fraud worth billions
with his business partners. His company went bankrupt. They went from being on the sky
to being on the ground. I've heard some really weird things. That he spent his money on women,
went bankrupt himself. In fact, he ruined his wife's business too. And this thing has spread like wildfire
in the advertising sector. You made a very hasty decision. Of marrying your son to such a man
of such ill reputation. I mean, Shahzar received proposals
from girls from all the prominent families. You were very rushed. Yes, hello! Where are you? Yes, the dinner is going on, and people are
arriving. Everything is fine, come quickly. Yes. The plan I have in my mind.
You will be happy when you hear it. Okay, come quickly. - Salam.
- Salam, Mr. Umar. How are you? - Yes, I'm good.
- Bhabi, how are you? - I'm good.
- We're starting a joint venture. And for this, we think we need
someone competent like you. And he's also looking for a decent job. Since I'm your in-law, I thought it
was my duty to inform you about this. Thank you so much, but I don't think
Umar needs any recommendations. He is capable and experienced,
and will easily find a job anywhere. . No, no, no. Mrs. Umar, it's not like that. We are not offering him a job
based on anyone’s recommendation. Rather, our organization needs
hardworking and honest people like Umar. Plus, we need an HR head, and I believe Umar is perfect for that. And it's not a recommendation.
And how could we not help in tough times? Right, sure. So consider it. Do think about it. Yes, I'll consider it. This jewelry is worth 5 crore!
Don't forget, and remember your promise. Why are you worried? Every word I've promised you,
I remember it very well. Let's go. No, no, son. See, Uncle, you can take as
much time as you need to think, but your answer should be yes. Plus, we are not doing you any favor.
Right, Mom? Shahzar is absolutely right. We need you, not the other way around. Our company needs you. I hope you will consider it
and don't disappoint us. - Please.
- We'll definitely consider it. - I think we should leave now.
- Yes. So, we'll take our leave then. I will tell the driver to drop you. No, no, no need for the driver.
We'll take a taxi from here. No, no. That's not even an option. - Not at all. Impossible! Shahzar, come on.
- No, no. - Driver.
- I'll call the driver. Please. I hope you had a good meal.
And that's everything was all right. Everything was all right, yes, thank
you so much. And beautiful arrangement. Thank you. - I'll go and check.
- Sure. I don’t know where he is. Thank God, our situation isn't so bad that we have to ask for help
from our daughter's in-laws. Umar, please tell them thanks,
but no thanks. How could you think that
I will accept their offer? Then why did you ask them for time?
That you'll think and let them know. I had just said it out of courtesy,
I couldn’t come up with another response. What could have I said? I am thinking of talking to
Shahzar in detail about this matter. Will Shahzar mind if you talk to him? I mean, I know you know better. Just talk in such a way that he understands
your point of view, but doesn't get offended. Yeah, as if they're going to help us. You looked really beautiful today. I was considering myself
to be really lucky. You didn't look bad either. I saw some girls staring at you, Really? Obviously, I got so dressed up for you. I'm almost the sole heir of the family, so girls are going to stare at me,
but my luck—look at that! I left all those girls
and married you instead. You know what? I was thinking the same thing. I mean... I mean, there was no shortage
of proposals for me either. Some of the most handsome men, by the way, and I ended up taking sleeping pills
for such a weird guy? You took sleeping pills, but the
fun part is that it worked on me. My mind went crazy,
and I ended up marrying you. Wow! On a serious note, Mom said you
should lock up your jewelry in the safe. I forgot. She’s right. There’s so much jewelry lying
around at home, and it’s not safe. Where are you going right now? I'll be back. Rameen, come back already.
What are you doing? What happened? Shahzar... my... I can't find my jewelry.
It's not in any of these boxes. What do you mean the jewelry’s not there?
don't panic. - Tell me did you lock it?
- Of course I locked it! I locked it. - I locked it.
- Move, let me see. I... Maybe I forgot the key, but I locked it. There's actually nothing in there. - Are you sure you kept it here?
- Yes! When I came, the door was ajar,
I thought... But-- - It was not--
- Relax, relax. We'll-- You go out. I... I'll check elsewhere. I think before filing a report with the
police, we should search all the rooms. Uncle, what do you think?
Who could have done this? No one in the family can do this. As for the staff,
I trust my servants completely. They've been working here for 25 years. No one would dare steal anything. It seems like an inside job. They knew everything about the house,
about the cameras. It must some guest. Uncle, what are you trying to say? I think everyone understood
what I was trying to say. The thief knew how to
turn off the CCTV cameras. I will speak to the SHO and
personally oversee this inquiry. There are only two guests in the house:
me and her. If you suspect us, just say it. Relax. That's not what Dad meant. That's what your daddy was pointing at.
We're the only two guests here. You're taking it the wrong way.
He didn’t mean it like that. - You be quiet!
- No, Nano, no. What's wrong with you?
Why are you getting so angry? And you are not a stranger. You’re a part
of this house, we respect you a lot, right? I don't think I said anything wrong. I’ll personally look into this matter
with the SHO. Wow! Now the police will be
called and we'll be searched! Right? Amma, you be quiet.
He didn't mean it like that. You be quiet! You always shut me up
in support of your husband. What is your daughter-in-law going
to think? What kind of people are we?
We rob our own house? Nano, you listen to me. Dad didn't say
anything about you. Why are you taking this
so personally unnecessarily? Look, Shahzar, I'm requesting you.
Go and search my room right now. Otherwise I'll leave this house. - Man, what's wrong with everyone?
- Sir, the police is here. - Go and check.
- I'll go and see. Just keep supporting me like this, and one day we’ll be billionaires. My love, I’ll always support you, at every step, at every turn. I'm with you. I know. I trust you more than myself. But, it's just... - I'm only scared about one thing.
- What's that? That when we go to Dubai,
you might forget me. My love, that’s impossible. If that was possible, then I wouldn't
have taken such a big risk for you. Oh! Is that true, Rohail? I'm being completely honest,
I swear on you. Tell me, has anyone suspected you at home? No, why would they? How could they suspect me?
I planned perfectly. Thank God we turned off
the cameras at the right time; otherwise, we’d both be in jail right now. By the way, I admit it. I haven’t met a smarter girl than you
in my entire life. Now you believe in me, huh? I only had my doubts before, but... now I’m sure that... someone from the family is involved
in this. What are you trying to say? Say it openly. If I'll say something, then... - you'll feel bad, but...
- No, no. You don't worry about me. You tell me what are you thinking. I... suspect Rameen. What? You suspect Rameen? Rameen? What are you saying? Do you even think what you're saying? You’re accusing my wife
of stealing her own jewelry? Try to understand what I'm saying. - I mean--
- I don't want to hear anything. All I know is that you're accusing your
daughter-in-law with something so cheap. He's not accusing anyone.
Just listen to him. I... I'm not accusing Rameen of stealing,
but I'm suspecting her parents. They're going through
a financial crisis now. Hassan has a large loan from the bank. It's possible Rameen's trying to help them
so she took the jewelry-- I don't want to talk to you
about any of this any further. What do I even say to you, Dad? And the people you're accusing
of stealing... They're so proud that they won't even accept a glass
of water from their daughter's in-laws. They won't ever steal anything! I'm not talking about stealing. It's possible Rameen felt pity
for her family, that's why she... Enough. I won't tolerate any more disrespect
towards my wife in this house. That's it. Calmly listen to him once.
Understand what he's trying to say-- I said enough, Mom! I told you I don't want to talk about it
anymore. Please close this chapter here! Our jewelry was stolen.
I don't mind that at all. But if anyone brings this up in
this house again, they'll regret it! Accusing someone without any evidence
isn't right. He says whatever comes to his mind
whenever he's mad. But, Tabinda,
I didn't expect this from you. I can't take Shahzar's side on everything
and oppose him for the sake of it. Sure, we have a lot of problems, but that
doesn't mean everything he says is wrong. He has seen the world,
he has a lot of experience. And I agree with him a 100 percent
in this matter. I won't accuse her because of Shahzar,
I won't say anything to her, but... but if this is true... she has lost her place in my heart,
she has lost all respect. Mama, all of my jewelry is gone,
only a diamond set is left. There's nothing left, everything's gone. Rameen... This... How did all of this happen? Such a big incident. Everyone was present
at the house yesterday and there was such
tight security at the gate. How did this happen? Mama, I don't know how this happened. Where's Shahzar?
Did he report it to the police? Mama, there's no point.
Police has searched the entire house. There's no proof of anything. I can't believe this. I don't understand. This is so weird. No thief entered the house, there's no doubt on the servants, so... - who did something like this?
- I don't know, Ammi. But it's been a great loss. Here. You check. It's cash. What is this? We had a deal of 50-50.
And this? A check worth 1 crore? Yeah, so we can only withdraw this much
from the bank. And you know selling jewelry is difficult. All the jewelers I go to,
they ask for a receipt. And I only sold half of it anyway,
the rest is in the bank locker. What's wrong? - Don't you have any patience?
- You keep this to yourself! I don't have any patience! I gave you jewelry worth 5 crore! Do you know how many zeros are there
in 5 crore? And this... this... You've me this check
worth one crore? Oh, man. Everything will be solved easily. It's just for a few more days. Then I'll give you all the money. Anyway... keep this check with you for now. And don't just roam around with it. Deposit it in the bank. You keep this to yourself. And I need my full share within a week!
Do you understand? Oh, oh! Where are you going? Sit. Listen to me. Have some patience, some courage.
What's wrong with you? What do you think? Who am I doing all of this for? I'm doing this for you? Oh! Whatever I have, it's yours. So you don't trust me, right? Don't! - I'll jump right away!
- No, no, no! Are you really... doing all of this for me? Sweetheart, who else am I doing it for? I'm doing everything for you. So that I can you give a peaceful life
filled with luxuries. No matter what lengths I
have to go to achieve that. I'll go! And... as long as you're with me... then you'll see. I'll take you so far. Oh, Rohail, I'm with you
for the rest of my life. You... you don't know how much I love you! I have an idea... about how much you love me. That's why I've taken such a big risk
for you. What were you saying about Shahzar's
sister? You wanted to tell me something? Yes. Minal Malik. She's a naive cow. She's a very innocent, naive,
beautiful, pious girl. You'll charm her in the blink of an eye. Should I show you the picture? She's cute. I don't understand. You've stopped eating
about such a small matter. Shahzar, a small matter? All of my jewelry was stolen
from my own bedroom. So? This isn't a very big deal.
I'll get you new one. Listen, I'm not fond of jewelry. It's not that it was very high in value. And it's such big deal, so much loss,
and we're just sitting ducks! You shouldn't have stopped the police
from conducting their inquiry. Okay, fine. What else could have I done?
You tell me. No outsider came into the house. They questioned all the servants, check the
servant quarters, what more could they do? Anyway, man. Come on, I feel like going
on a long drive. We'll have dinner too. Please! Hina, I've never worn these clothes before. And these are all very expensive,
I got them made specially. Some of these clothes are the ones 
I designed for Rameen's wedding, I've only worn them once, so... All of your dressed will be sold 
for 2-3 lakhs. If you have some other things,
do let me know. My friend's husband owns a showroom,
I can ask him to display it. You'll get a handsome amount 
in a few days. Crockery too? I have brand new
crockery sets. Dinner sets, tea sets. - I haven't even opened them yet.
- Mehru, your crockery is expensive. Think it through. I don't have time to think. Right now,
I need cash instead of things. Actually I was thinking of getting 
a second-hand car for Umar. He has to bother with public transport
when he goes out to look for a job. So let him! He's man. Men have to face such situations
in life, Mehr-un-Nisa. You've already done so much for Umar. Now you're selling all your
expensive things to buy him a car. You decorated this house 
with so much love and care. You've already done Umar many favors. Hina, if a wife does for her husband,
that's not a favor. Don't talk this useless, deceitful
nonsense in front of me, Mehr-un-Nisa. Idiot wives like you are the ones
who put their husbands on a pedestal. Men are very close hearted. They don't remember a woman's favors. Hina, I didn't call you here
to give me a lecture. Tell me if you can help,
otherwise I'll manage myself. Fine. Don't get upset. Of course, 
I'll help. Get me a good cup of tea.
