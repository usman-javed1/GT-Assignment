[13.17] Tabinda wants to take revenge
on me for every bit of life...
[18.15] she’s imagined getting back at me for.
[19.32] She has reached a point where she
can't hear anything nor understand.
[24.06] - Is Mehr-un-Nisa okay?
- Phuppo, the doctors have given up.
[68.06] If I had known earlier
[71.15] that I got this job through Tabinda's
reference, I would never have accepted it.
[79.23] Don't you remember what Abbu used to say?
[82.77] If a woman loves,
she destroys herself for that love.
[86.65] And if she hates,
she destroys the other person.
[91.05] Tabinda wants to take revenge
on me for every bit of life...
[95.41] she’s imagined getting back at me for.
[96.56] She has reached a point where she
can't hear anything nor understand.
[104.25] I don't see Shahzar or Rameen around.
[106.63] Rameen is so upset because of her mother
that she doesn't come out her room.
[111.97] So how is her mother doing now?
[114.49] It's critical. Doctors aren't hopeful.
[117.78] So if Rameen wants to go,
send her there for a few days.
[121.32] Yeah, yeah. She can go whenever she wants,
for however long she wants.
[125.06] I've told them we'll support them
as much as we can through their daughter.
[131.34] Shahzar said he'll bear all the
treatment expenses, whatever they need.
[138.92] Tabinda, that's great.
[144.45] They're our relatives. It's our duty
to help them.
[151.20] But I've noticed one thing.
[154.60] Ever since Rameen has gotten married,
their circumstances have only gotten worse.
[162.40] But thankfully, Umar has found a job now.
[166.33] Yes, yes. He got it through my reference.
[170.41] Through your reference?
[172.27] You never mentioned it before.
[174.25] What was there to say? I tried to help him.
[177.45] You know I can't see Shahzar upset.
[181.27] Since Rameen and Shahzar's marriage,
[183.19] Shahzar hasn’t had a single day
of happiness.
[186.66] Rameen has been so tangled with issues
at her home.
[190.08] Then I tried to make a plan for vacations,
[192.66] I forced Shahzar to go abroad
for a few days, in fact.
[195.50] That was also canceled.
[198.78] God forgive me...
[200.97] but I think troubles
have cursed their house.
[204.93] You're right, Aapa.
[256.77] I hope you remember. We have to
meet today. 12 pm at the same place.
[261.48] I'll wait for you.
[274.75] Tea.
[277.16] No tea, I have to leave quickly.
[279.85] Is there something important?
[282.02] Yes, I have to go for an interview.
[284.84] And make sure you’re ready by 3,
I’ve to take you to the hospital. Okay?
[290.64] I'll go now. Okay, bye.
[399.78] Here, a check for 10 lakh. It'll help
you with Mehr-un-Nisa's treatment.
[404.26] I'll take care of all the expenses.
[409.03] Keep your charity to yourself.
I don't need it.
[412.37] Oh! Listen to me.
At least say what you came here to say.
[417.06] I didn't come here to talk to you.
[420.32] I came here to warn you, Tabinda.
[424.19] Stay away from my and my daughter's life.
[429.18] The hatred you're putting in her
heart for me, it'll be very costly for you.
[434.61] And if I wanted to...
[436.61] What will you do? Tell me.
What will you do?
[439.23] Are you going to blackmail me?
[440.54] I'm not blackmailing you,
you're blackmailing me.
[443.97] Ever since my daughter
got married into your family,
[446.33] I haven't had a single night
of peaceful sleep.
[449.68] Do you even care?
[454.38] What is this revenge for?
[456.80] Just for breaking off the engagement
with you and marrying Mehr-un-Nisa?
[461.63] It's a small thing for you?
[464.01] Breaking of an engagement, severing
a relationship, that's a small thing?
[467.05] It took me years to forget about you.
[471.00] It's not easy to tolerate betrayal,
Mr. Umar.
[473.68] I didn't expect this selfishness from you.
[475.85] You used to love me a lot, right?
[478.18] But you shattered all my illusions
by choosing wealth over me.
[481.64] It took away my trust in people.
You broke off your relationship with me.
[485.78] I didn't marry Mehr-un-Nisa for money.
I've told you this before.
[490.80] I've tried a lot of times!
[491.89] You broke off your engagement
to a poor man's daughter
[493.91] and married a wealthy, sick woman
[496.58] so that you can take over her wealth
after her death.
[499.94] Enough, Tabinda! I don’t want to hear
any more of this.
[503.27] You were very unfair to me.
You betrayed me.
[506.37] And I will never forgive you for that.
[508.75] For God's sake! Don't punish my daughter
for the mistakes I didn't make.
[512.63] She's very innocent.
What has she got to do with any of this?
[517.70] I'm requesting you. Please, I'm sorry.
I'm begging you.
[521.44] Remember a long time back, I begged you
liked this too?
[525.92] Begged and whined.
[528.68] But you and your mother didn't pity me.
Do you remember?
[532.51] I'm sorry, I'm extremely sorry.
[536.04] I'm your sinner. I made a mistake
that I left you and married Mehr-un-Nisa.
[540.87] But I was helpless.
What else was I supposed to do?
[542.67] Is that what you want to hear?
[544.09] It didn't even take you a second
to forget me and start a new life.
[547.59] But it took me ages.
[549.97] Maybe that's the difference between a man
and a woman.
[552.99] All my happiness was related to you.
[555.27] You left and took my happiness with you.
[558.84] But I thought you were very happy
after marrying Shahnawaz.
[562.96] Because everything I couldn't give you,
he gave it to you.
[567.18] Where were you?
[568.56] He took you from the ground
and put you on the sky.
[571.58] What do you think? That I'm very happy?
[574.78] I'm just alive.
[576.56] Only I know how I spent these years
being married to Shahnawaz.
[581.50] After marrying him, I got everything
except love.
[585.56] Because the word "love" was banished
from my dictionary the day you walked out.
[592.30] I tried a lot to make Shahnawaz happy.
[595.81] But my sacrifices,
my loyalty were never appreciated.
[598.85] I only received rejection
for being middle class.
[602.91] Middle class.
[605.46] You rushed into this marriage.
[608.55] Just to make me feel inferior.
[610.88] You married a rich man, right?
[615.02] Look, Tabinda, all we get from life
is what’s written in our destiny.
[620.26] No matter how hard we try,
no matter how hard we swim,
[625.60] but we can't change the tides.
[631.19] Tabinda, I can't change whatever happened.
[637.24] But I can only hope...
[641.35] that you'll forget the painful memories
of the past,
[644.04] and try to make a good life
with your family.
[648.18] It's very important for you.
[654.34] As for me,
I only have one request of you.
[659.71] Whatever you think I did wrong
to you in your opinion...
[663.51] just don't punish my daughter for it.
[667.58] I only had this request of you.
[671.18] And I hope you'll think about it.
[686.02] I'm not blackmailing you,
you're blackmailing me.
[689.38] Ever since my daughter
got married into your family,
[691.94] I haven't had a single night
of peaceful sleep.
[695.72] What is this revenge for?
[698.41] Just for breaking off the engagement
with you and marrying Mehr-un-Nisa?
[704.45] It's a small thing for you?
[706.85] Breaking of an engagement, severing
a relationship, that's a small thing?
[709.83] It took me years to forget about you.
[714.45] You used to love me a lot, right?
[716.62] But you shattered all my illusions
by choosing wealth over me.
[720.08] It took away my trust in people.
[723.40] You broke off your engagement
to a poor man's daughter
[725.58] and married a wealthy, sick woman
[728.13] so that you can take over her wealth
after her death.
[732.44] You were very unfair to me.
You betrayed me.
[735.53] And I will never forgive you for that.
[743.74] Mehru, where did you go?
Umar wasn't with you?
[752.35] Right now, your son is mourning his love
with his former fiancee.
[758.75] - What?
- I saw it with my own eyes.
[764.35] Mehru? Mehr-un-Nisa, listen to me.
[768.34] Meh-- Mehru, listen to me. Mehru.
[773.46] Mehr-un-Nisa!
[775.98] Listen to me, dear!
[778.95] Mehru.
[782.10] Mehru!
[784.97] Mama's pain is increasing day
by day, Shahzar.
[789.83] The chemotherapy cannot happen;
the doctor has refused.
[795.25] Don't stress.
[797.86] I consulted with the doctor,
[800.67] and he suggested that if we take her
abroad, her treatment could be done.
[804.63] I wish it was like that.
I wish she'd let us do that.
[812.46] You know, Mama's absolutely right.
[815.85] When she says
that you're the ideal husband.
[819.76] You're a really good person.
[822.84] Really?
[826.49] And is Auntie the only
one who thinks like that or...
[829.65] you think the same about me too?
[832.15] My opinion doesn't really matter
in all of this.
[835.34] I love you.
[837.62] And it's all that matters.
[841.98] Can I ask you something?
[845.35] Do you still love me as much
as you did before our marriage?
[851.53] Shahzar, why do you
even have to ask me that?
[855.48] There was a need to ask so I did.
[860.59] Because I feel like you don't love me
as much anymore.
[865.59] I feel as if...
[868.27] that love has slipped away with time.
[873.41] Tell me, what can I do
to remove this doubt from your mind?
[879.52] Even if you don't do anything else...
[883.03] you can at least stop going to your home
as much as you do.
[887.53] Start spending time with me.
[890.23] You know you're very different
than other men, right?
[895.16] The others used to be so happy to send
their wives away...
[901.14] but you... you just become sad.
[904.91] That's because the men who send
their wives away don't love them.
[913.23] And I don't want to be one of those men.
[917.52] Thank God, you're smiling.
[920.29] I’ve been longing to see you happy.
[924.65] Keep smiling, man.
[927.41] You know, when you smile, it feels like...
[931.20] my life, my whole day is complete.
[941.17] Mama, what happened? Please talk to me.
Why aren’t you saying anything?
[948.01] Rameen, I spoke to the doctors.
[951.86] He says it's nothing to worry about.
[954.92] Maybe Auntie is very stressed.
[958.10] And that's why she fainted,
but she's much better now.
[964.69] What are you so stressed about
that your fainted? Huh?
[969.24] Rameen...
[971.01] this is not the time. Right now,
[973.41] Auntie isn't in a condition
to be under any mental pressure.
[980.32] Shahzar is right, dear.
[983.87] You should go.
[986.48] I want to be alone for a little while.
[991.08] Mama, I can't leave you like this.
[993.37] Rameen, listen to me.
[996.83] Please.
[1022.53] Umar, it'd be better if you leave too.
[1032.09] I don't want to listen to anything
you have to say.
[1083.02] I know...
[1087.15] the mistake that I made...
[1090.14] I'm not worthy to being forgiven for that.
[1099.42] You can punish me however you want.
[1107.90] If you want...
[1110.45] you can hand me over to the police.
[1118.85] I'll pay you back for every penny.
[1128.24] I...
[1130.83] I came to give Minal...
[1134.33] pain.
[1142.27] But when I came...
[1144.99] I realized...
[1149.35] that I love her.
[1152.28] A person like you...
[1155.24] A greedy, cheater like you
can never love someone.
[1161.32] Why won't you trust me?
[1165.27] You could go as far as
killing me to prove this.
[1168.27] I have no interest in killing you.
[1171.96] Sign this.
[1205.29] And if I don't sign this, then?
[1217.52] I actually love Minal.
[1220.56] Why won't you believe me?
[1241.84] I think she has learned everything
about you and your past with Tabinda.
[1248.28] This is how she's going to react
for a few days.
[1252.83] Yes, I...
[1255.27] Yes, I admit, this is big news for her.
[1259.55] Finding out the one thing I've
tried to hide from her all my life.
[1263.61] I know this isn't easy for her, but...
[1267.87] but she can give me one chance.
[1270.53] Let me at least try and explain it to her.
[1278.92] But there's one thing I don't understand,
Ammi. How did she find out? She...
[1283.23] How did she get there?
[1287.73] Maybe she heard you on the phone,
talking to Tabinda.
[1292.74] I'm sick of Tabinda's name.
[1296.14] Tabinda! Tabinda! Tabinda!
[1298.90] I hate this name.
[1303.86] She has made my and daughter's life hell,
but if she...
[1308.22] if something happened to Mehru, Ammi,
I'll never forgive her.
[1311.65] Never ever.
[1322.06] Why are you so quiet?
[1324.82] Aren't you going to say anything?
[1329.80] Is there anything left...
[1332.09] to say and hear?
[1343.79] You won’t even give me a chance to explain?
[1346.71] Aren't you going to ask 
why I went to meet her?
[1352.56] I... I know everything.
[1355.40] I've found out everything.
[1358.55] If you know everything, then say something.
[1360.90] Are you upset? Complain.
[1374.51] What kind of a complain?
[1377.74] What anger, Umar?
[1381.16] Come on, Mehru! If you...
[1383.48] if you keep behaving like this, 
I will die suffocating.
[1389.15] You’re in no condition to
handle this alone. I’m here!
[1393.26] Just ask. I will tell you everything 
about my past.
[1400.68] It's too late.
[1403.94] Now I know everything about you.
[1411.44] You were engaged to Tabinda.
[1415.40] You loved each other a lot.
[1421.21] You both swore to live and die together.
[1427.14] And then I came along.
[1429.24] No, you didn't come in the middle of us.
[1433.47] Mehru, you were my destiny,
[1435.98] my fate, and I was yours.
We had to meet.
[1439.98] Had you not been there, it would've
been someone, but not Tabinda.
[1444.86] Because the kind of woman she is, 
she could never have been my partner.
[1450.92] I buried all this...
[1454.34] but somehow, through Shahzar, 
she entered our lives again.
[1460.19] Is that why you were so opposed 
to their relationship?
[1466.25] Yes.
[1468.67] Such a big thing with me...
[1471.87] Why did you share it with me?
[1475.47] You didn't deem me worthy?
[1477.03] No, Mehru. It was because of your health.
[1480.93] I kept it hidden for so long,
[1482.62] maybe I would have hidden it my whole
life, just so that you wouldn’t be hurt.
[1488.36] You made a big mistake 
by keeping this secret from me.
[1493.18] You should've told me.
[1495.69] I would never have let my
daughter marry Tabinda’s step-son.
[1504.55] This is why she's like this.
[1509.72] Why... why is she being so cruel 
to my daughter?
[1520.81] She won't do anything.
[1522.92] I won't let it happen until I'm alive.
[1528.47] That woman is burning 
with the fire of revenge.
[1534.15] She's punishing my daughter
for your betrayal.
[1541.83] What can we do?
[1545.99] Promise me something.
[1551.29] You have to protect my daughter after me.
[1555.68] Nothing's going to happen to you.
[1559.94] If possible, get her a divorce.
[1562.87] After I’m gone, take her far away.
[1567.88] Tabinda is a very dangerous woman.
[1571.87] She lives with my daughter.
[1574.83] She can do anything.
[1577.41] You sit here. I'll get water for you.
[1584.20] What can I do?
[1587.52] My child!
[1616.97] I'm not worthy being forgiven
for the mistakes I've made.
[1622.22] You can punish me however you want.
[1627.08] If you want...
[1629.61] you can hand me over the to the police.
[1660.97] I came to cause Minal pain.
[1665.45] But when I came...
[1668.18] I realized...
[1670.28] that I love her.
[1679.27] I truly love Minal.
[1682.27] Why won't you trust me?
[1768.55] How come you're here today?
[1769.91] I wanted to talk to you
about something important.
[1772.17] How are you feeling now?
[1776.48] - Coffee? Tea?
- No.
[1778.64] There's no need for any formalities.
[1781.19] I didn't come here as a guest
or as your in-law.
[1786.68] I just came here to ask you for something.
[1789.99] Me?
[1792.07] What can I give you?
What have you come to ask me?
[1796.87] My daughter's happiness.
[1800.78] The game of hide and seek that you've been
playing with her for the last 2 years...
[1805.58] please stop, Tabinda.
[1811.63] What's the point of all of this?
[1814.16] What did I do to your daughter?
[1816.85] What didn't you do?
[1819.30] For the past two years,
since my daughter’s marriage,
[1823.03] I haven’t seen a day where she was happy.
[1826.54] You’ve tried to cause her trouble 
at every step.
[1832.11] You’ve tried to get Shahzar to hate her.
[1835.82] But I’m telling you now,
[1838.15] none of your tricks will work.
[1841.11] Because your son truly loves my daughter.
[1846.38] What’s my daughter’s fault?
[1848.90] Just that she's Umar Hassan's daughter?
[1852.00] The same Umar Hassan...
[1854.47] who couldn't marry you.
[1858.18] First of all, you don’t have any proof
of these things,
[1860.89] and secondly, don’t bring Umar into this.
[1863.96] You have nothing to do 
with my personal life.
[1866.37] Your personal life has been ruining 
my daughter’s life.
[1871.06] It's just me who's found out for now.
[1873.29] But soon your son 
and husband will also know.
[1877.24] What justifications will you give them?
[1879.72] That you’re ruining his daughter’s life 
to take revenge on your former fiancé?
[1888.46] Are you seeking revenge 
on Umar Hassan's daughter for his betrayal?
[1893.01] It's not, it's hatred, Tabinda.
[1895.89] In fact, what you have for Umar in
your heart is even greater than hatred.
[1901.91] You never had true love for Umar.
[1905.18] Maybe that's why you aren't together today.
[1909.88] Women who are consumed with revenge
can never truly love someone.
[1916.36] You need a very big heart for love.
[1920.45] Which you don't have.
[1927.09] All right, Tabinda.
[1929.48] I thought I'd be able to come here
and get through to you.
[1933.97] Get you to stop the hatred 
and accept my daughter with an open heart.
[1939.87] But now I understand it’s impossible.
[1944.73] I leave my daughter in care of God.
[1952.07] Just remember this, Tabinda.
[1955.26] The game of hatred that you've started...
[1958.82] it will only harm you.
[1983.38] No, Amma! You shouldn't have let her go
like this!
[1986.22] God knows where she's gone off too.
Her condition isn't good either.
[1989.84] Son, I really tried to stop her.
But she didn't listen to me at all.
[1994.87] God knows where she has gone off too.
Please call Rameen.
[1998.14] Maybe she's gone to her home.
[1999.26] Why would I call her?
She doesn't answer my calls.
[2004.95] Where were you, Mehru?
[2006.80] You don't know how worried we got
for you!
[2022.38] Mehru, listen to me.
[2024.90] You'll have to talk to me--
[2047.64] Dear, I'm very worried
about Mehr-un-Nisa.
[2051.36] She hasn't eaten anything since yesterday.
[2053.66] She's not taking her medicine
on time either.
[2055.83] I'm trying of trying to talk to her.
[2058.67] Call Rameen. Maybe she'll listen to her.
[2063.02] She has stopped talking to you.
[2067.14] What can I say?
[2070.28] When I enter her room,
[2071.99] either she’s already asleep, 
or she turns her face away from me.
[2077.91] What can I say to her?
[2081.07] She doesn't want to understand anything,
doesn't want to talk to me.
[2086.52] Why don't you openly talk to her about it?
[2089.56] Ammi, I want to openly talk to her.
I want to tell her everything.
[2093.92] I want her to know the circumstances
under which I got engaged to Tabinda,
[2097.34] why it broke, and how I ended
up marrying her. But she...
[2100.82] But she thinks I only married her for
her status, for her money and business.
[2106.92] How do I clear this misunderstanding
when she doesn’t even talk to me?
[2110.28] - If you say, should I talk to her?  
- No, Ammi. I--
[2115.70] I’ll try myself. I’ll wait for
the right time and talk to her.
[2120.09] Son, if she thinks you
married her for her status,
[2124.34]  you need to clear this misunderstanding.
[2127.97] You broke up with Tabinda for me,
[2131.87] and you married Mehr-un-Nisa for me.
[2136.88] This has to be cleared.
[2141.01] Mehr-un-Nisa’s father was so impressed
by your honesty, dignity, and hard work
[2148.15] that he came to himself to talk 
about his daughter's proposal.
[2154.03] He was a heart patient.
[2156.50] He knew he didn't have a lot of time.
[2160.14] He couldn't have found a more suitable
person that you for his sick daughter.
[2167.22] But you? You weren't ready
for this marriage at all.
[2171.77] They even offered you
shares in their company,
[2176.50] but you rejected all their offers.
[2179.35] Because you didn't want to break up
with Tabinda no matter what.
[2184.43] You didn't want to break her heart.
[2190.60] But then I convinced you.
[2193.68] I begged you.
[2195.86] I pressured you into marrying Mehr-un-Nisa.
[2201.83] Thank God, it was the
right decision for you both.
[2206.95] Because you two were made for each other.
[2209.87] You didn't deserve a greedy, selfish woman
like Tabinda.
