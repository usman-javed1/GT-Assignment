[13.39] Talk to me frankly.
what are you trying to say?
[16.30] The job he's showing off about these days,
my mother-in-law made it happen.
[21.32] Because his own reputation is so bad
that no one wants to employ him.
[26.38] Mr.  Umar, I have checked the quotations
and it is ready for your signature.
[33.42] This is a risky job,
you'll have to be careful.
[37.21] Keep it in your bag.  -What
[38.97] ...what is this?  -These
are the birth control pills.
[44.03] I didn't expect this from this woman.
[46.49] How low can someone go?
I'll talk to Shahzar.
[49.74] Please, Omar.  Don't get involved
in this matter.
[53.15] Why shouldn't I be involved, dear?
[55.21] She is upset with us,
[56.52] but that doesn't mean we throw her into
the swamp and leave her alone.
[61.45] She's not alone in being taunted
for being childless!
[66.17] Is this a joke?  I'm still alive!
I can handle this situation!
[70.10] I know, Omar.
[72.73] Rameen doesn't want us to get
involved in any matters with her in-laws.
[76.69] Because it will be difficult
for her at the end.
[79.71] She is already very upset with both of us.
[82.25] The gynecologist just told
her to avoid stressful situations.
[96.27] Our daughter is wise, touch wood.
She will find a solution herself.
[142.51] Here you go!
[143.99] Your brother has ordered
your favorite Manchurian for you.
[148.24] Now you have to eat it, because I made this
plate myself for the first time in my life.
[153.32] And look, I won't take a bite
from your plate today.
[157.19] All of this food, you must eat it all.
[161.25] Okay, let's do this.
[162.84] If you don't feel like eating,
[165.70] then I'll make a bite for my sister
and feed her myself.
[169.64] here you go.
[175.39] Minal.
[179.12] How long will you keep on starving?
[181.62] Everyone at home is worried about you.
[185.20] Please eat it.
[190.37] No, with my hands.
[192.19] Come on.
[196.97] And tell me how is it?
[269.44] I don't understand...
[272.81] how to bring back Minal's happiness
and smile.
[277.29] How do I bring her back to life?
[283.56] God is willing, everything will be fine,
don't worry.
[287.50] Have patience.  Patience.
[293.37] I don't have the strength.
I can't have patience.
[298.77] I'll have to do something.
[302.63] what can you do?  what can you even do?
[305.92] I can do a lot.
[307.94] I'm only quiet because of Shahnawaz.
[309.77] He cares about the family's honour
and reputation.
[314.07] And I'm dying to take revenge.
[317.71] I'll find him.
[320.54] Wherever he is, I'll find him.
[323.29] I won't let him go so easily.
[325.70] I cannot forgive him.
[328.07] Absolutely not.
[331.06] I'll find him.
[362.99] I also want revenge from Kamran.
[365.56] And I'm also looking forward
to his downfall.
[368.89] I can give his address and phone number,
but...
[372.13] if Khala finds out about Kamran and me,
[374.79] the doors of this house
will be closed for me forever.
[378.88] I'm living the life of luxury here.
[382.21] Such a good job, a wonderful job,
and a wealthy prospect like Shahzar.
[388.75] I can't let go of all of this so easily.
[393.17] What can I do to kill the snake
without breaking the stick?
[420.13] Hello?
[422.51] I need to talk to you about
something very important.
[425.43] What is so urgent?
[428.65] You don't need any money, do you?
[432.61] No, it's something really important, but
promise me you won't tell anyone, okay?
[437.92] All right.
[440.84] Ka... I have to talk to you about Kamran.
[444.17] The guy who was fooling Minal
by pretending to be Kamran Shah.
[447.94] I want to talk about him.
[453.34] Look, Khala is desperate to take
revenge from him no matter what,
[458.03] and she will talk to you about this too.
[460.67] Just think,
[462.31] if you help Khala and Uncle to
capture Kamran,
[467.22] think of the position
you will have in their eyes.
[471.80] Uncle will give you a promotion
in the blink of an eye!
[474.37] and Khala, who gives
you millions for small tasks,
[479.72] this is about her daughter.
[481.69] Don't talk in circles.  Come to the point.
[489.37] I can help you capture Kamran.
[493.26] But there is one condition:
Khala cannot find it.
[497.04] How do you know Kamran?
[538.14] I can't trust anyone in Kamran's matter.
[541.92] Please book my ticket and hotel.
[546.34] I'll tell Shahnawaz and Shahzar
that I'm going for a meeting.
[551.60] Why don't you understand?  Look,
one day or another, everyone will find out
[557.31] that you didn’t go for a meeting
but were looking for Kamran.
[563.79] I make my own decisions.
I don't need any suggestions from anyone.
[568.43] I know that.  Who knows it better than me?
[571.86] Look, all I'm trying to tell you is
[574.09] finding someone in a city like Dubai,
when you have no information about them, is not an
[579.18] easy job.
[581.11] It's not that difficult either.
We have many connections.
[583.57] We know a lot of people.
[585.47] We can take help from the police, we
have his pictures, we have the information.
[589.08] Wow, wow, I salute your thinking.
[593.35] But didn't you think that even
if you catch him with the police,
[597.28] the whole city will know that Shahnawaz
Malik's son-in-law was arrested for theft?
[604.93] How will Shah Nawaz Malik feel?
What will happen to him?
[610.00] He told the whole family that his
son-in-law is in Dubai for business.
[616.85] what do you want me to do?  You want me to
let him go so easily, without consequences?
[620.67] I shouldn't get him punished?
[621.86] Oh, we'll punish him ourselves!
[624.95] We'll scare him, we'll threaten him,
[627.77] we'll tell him that in Dubai, stealing
means getting your hand chopped off.
[633.16] He'll get scared and return
our money and jewellery.
[641.73] Listen to me and understand me.
[645.03] Give me a little time,
if he’s not in your feet by then,
[650.55] change my name to something else.
[659.27] Now, cheer up!
[701.25] Oh, Mehru.
[703.02] Why did you come to
the kitchen in this heat?
[705.95] Not at all.  Actually, Umar asked
for chicken biryani after a long time,
[712.84] and I thought I’d surprise both you
and him.
[715.70] Okay, as you wish.
[718.52] I'll just cut the grapefruit.
[721.53] Look at this.
[726.00] Okay, I'll check it.
[733.79] Ammi!
[736.36] What happened?  Mehru!  Mehru?
[738.43] What happened to you, dear?
Open your eyes.  Mehru
[740.21] ?  Mehru!
[742.59] Mehru, open your eyes!  Mehru?  Mehru!  Mehru
[745.96] ?  Oh my God!  have mercy.
What do I do?
[749.60] I'll call Omar.
[760.15] Yes?
[761.93] Yes, yes, Ammi.  It's me.  What happened?
[765.40] What?  what are you saying?
[767.74] How?  Did she faint?  When?
[772.00] But-- all right.
[775.21] Okay, you don't worry.  I'll be there in
10 minutes.  It'll take me 10 minutes.
[780.35] Oh-- Okay, I'll call an ambulance.
Wait.
[783.21] We have to take her to the hospital.
We can't leave her like that.
[787.36] And listen.  Don't call me Rameen.
[790.27] No, no, no.  Don't tell her.
She'll get worried.
[792.52] I'll tell you Shahzar myself.
[901.85] You didn't tell me that
she is a cancer patient.
[905.07] No, she isn't anymore.
She was a long time ago.
[910.03] She was being treated in America for
a while.  She also had a surgery there.
[915.25] Yes, the surgeons there assured
that the tumor would not grow again.
[920.25] The tumor was removed...
[923.48] but the cancer has spread throughout her body.
[930.00] Now, you should get her shifted to a good
hospital so she can get timely treatment.
[934.43] If you want, I will send her reports
to a good hospital,
[937.64] but you will need to admit
her there immediately,
[940.62] and they might recommend
surgery right away.
[943.52] So please be mentally prepared for this.
[946.96] - Surgery?  -Yes
.
[948.86] The cancer has spread throughout her body,
and it's very difficult to control,
[953.01] but don't worry,
[954.76] with timely treatment and prayers,
it can be controlled.
[958.34] I will discharge her tomorrow morning,
[960.54] and as soon as I get a response from
the cancer hospital, I will inform you.  Is
[964.62] everything right?  Okay.  Did
[1034.64] you see, Khala?
[1036.40] Despite all your efforts,
Shahzar hasn't lost trust in Rameen.
[1047.84] I don't know what she has done,
he is always singing her praises.
[1061.27] You don't waste your time by thinking
about all of this.
[1064.52] Just focus on what
you've been tasked to do.
[1067.72] Things are in motion.
[1070.53] I'm giving him the medicine as well.
[1072.09] And the fake reports you asked
for will be ready in two days.
[1078.67] You will get your money tomorrow.
[1083.85] I'm not doing this work out
of greed for money, Khala.
[1088.52] Really?
[1090.34] then what else do you want?
[1095.33] Shahzar.
[1099.37] Shahzar?
[1104.37] Have you gone mad?
[1108.99] Huh?  Are you mad?
[1111.67] You are dreaming about marrying Shahzar?
[1115.07] You know your status, right?
[1117.16] Look, Khala, just like how
Shahnawaz Uncle married you, leaving so
[1121.75] many other women behind,
so I can also marry him like this.
[1125.96] Now, after Shahzar's divorce, you
will get him married to someone else,
[1130.44] so why can't I be that girl, Khala?
[1134.15] Are you competing with me?
[1137.09] No, no, Khala, how
could I compete with you?
[1140.21] God forbid!  No, no,
you're misunderstanding me.
[1143.09] Look, I'm just saying that Shahzar listens
to you.
[1147.12] If you ask him, he will agree.  You...
[1149.49] You convince him to marry me, Khala.
[1151.84] Oh madam.
[1153.90] You can stay in this house as a guest,
[1157.96] but you will never be the daughter-in-law.
do you understand?
[1174.42] I think we should tell Rameen
about her mother's condition.
[1181.32] You should tell her.  I can't...
I can't gather the courage.
[1186.42] What do the doctors say?
Will Mehru survive?
[1191.65] The doctors didn't give any hope.
[1204.21] You don't worry.
[1207.95] God is great.
[1212.66] He saved her before too, right?
[1215.15] He will create a way for her again.
[1217.47] Nothing is impossible for Him.
[1227.66] The doctors say there's no point
in further treatment.
[1232.07] But still, if you insist, we will...
[1236.21] The treatment they'll do now,
it will be very expensive.
[1244.68] Don't worry about the money.
I will talk to your sister today.
[1249.82] She will arrange 8-10 lakh rupees.
[1253.57] You can borrow the rest from the office.
[1258.41] The office is not giving it.  They say...
[1263.19] that my job is new, and I've only
been here a few days, so they...
[1266.39] can't lend such a large amount on loan.
[1271.84] If I have to sell myself to get the money,
I will do that, but... I don't
[1275.84] even have a buyer for myself.
What should I do?
[1280.10] Don't say such things.
[1284.34] Don't lose hope.
[1286.96] These trials will end.
[1291.67] If you lose hope,
[1294.73] so who will give Mehru the strength?
[1297.84] Son, pray that she survives.
[1301.52] The way she has fought
against a disease like cancer...
[1307.19] God will show mercy on us.
[1311.12] I hope that God grants us a miracle.
[1316.93] Oh my God.  Have mercy on us.
[1320.94] God, have mercy on us.
[1342.38] is the packing done?
[1343.78] es, yes, I will pack my stuff
once yous is done.
[1346.55] Listen, do you want to take this shirt
with you?
[1348.66] Yes, keep it.  But listen, do remember
to keep my purple tie and joggers.
[1354.27] I've kept it.
[1356.26] And by the way,
I checked the weather forecast,
[1360.20] and it's going to be very cold there.
[1363.21] So bring warm clothes for both of us.
[1365.46] I also checked.  I've kept them too.
[1369.89] What's going on?  You seem very happy today.
[1373.55] Not just happy, I'm excited too.
[1375.39] I mean, look, we're going abroad together
for the first time after our wedding.
[1381.07] I know I sound silly, but it feels
as if we're newly married.
[1384.83] - As if we're going on a honeymoon.
- So I think it's like that.
[1389.32] Imagine if we're going on a honeymoon.
[1394.18] You know what I want, Rameen?
[1397.67] I want this trip to be very memorable
for me.
[1400.46] I want the two of to spend time together,
without involving a third person.
[1405.68] Who's the third person?
It's just the two of us.
[1408.07] There is stress about home, about work,
about business.
[1414.15] We have to leave everything here.
[1416.57] Freeing our mind of everything.
[1419.60] And most importantly, I want...
[1423.20] you to not be depressed
about your home issues.
[1429.71] I promise.  Nothing like that is
going to happen.  Solid promise.
[1432.63] -Solid?
-Solid!
[1434.80] Listen, did you tell Uncle we're leaving?
[1437.16] No, I didn't tell him yet.  -But
[1438.41] I'll be on the breakfast table.
-Shahzar, man!
[1442.12] Come on, man.  I'm helping you pack
and you're not even appreciating me.
[1446.66] You're doing me such a huge favor!
[1448.18] First, you told me to speak respectfully,
but where are my clothes?
[1451.31] You didn't make tea for me, and it
feels like you don't care about me.
[1455.63] Forget it!  Man, you know I'm quick
tempered.  I just stupid things like these.
[1459.65] I was just teasing you.
[1461.20] I know.  Before we start fighting again,
I'm going to the breakfast table.  Come.
[1465.59] Okay.
[1467.24] You!
[1474.88] Idiot.
[1480.41] Salam, Uncle.
[1482.46] How are you?
[1486.79] What happened, Uncle?
[1488.93] Is... is everything okay?
[1493.84] What?
[1498.11] Uncle, how is this possible?
[1501.58] Are you sure the reports are...
[1504.38] Are the reports correct?
[1509.90] Oh my God.
[1511.59] Uncle, you don't worry.  I'm...
[1514.38] I'm coming.
[1516.07] Yes, yes.  I'll bring Rameen along with me.
[1519.58] Yes.
[1532.87] Dado, why didn't anyone tell me
about this?
[1536.71] My dear, I told them not to.
[1541.29] You were already so disturbed.
[1543.54] I didn't want to bother you anymore.
[1547.87] You've gotten married now.
You should focus on your husband.
[1552.93] What does being married mean?
Is my relationship over with both of you?
[1557.10] Huh?
[1558.18] You know there's no one in the world-- You
know how important you both are in my life.
[1565.07] What are the doctors saying?
[1568.39] Which hospital is the
treatment taking place at?
[1571.36] It is a government hospital close by.
[1575.10] Government hospital?
[1577.51] Why didn't you take her
to a private hospital?
[1580.10] Look, I-- Please, I want to say something.
[1583.49] Please take her to a good hospital.
I will take care of all the expenses.
[1589.77] In fact, mom also said to send you this
message: Don't worry about the money.
[1596.81] Uncle, please give me her file.
I'll take her to a good doctor.
[1602.88] Dear...
[1604.62] whether it is a government or private
hospital, the treatment will be the same.
[1609.60] And I hate you and your mom saying
that isn't feasible.
[1615.05] We are the girl's family,
[1617.68] we can't even afford the water--
[1619.89] These are old ways of thinking.
Please, don't think like that.
[1623.92] Besides, you told me that I am your son,
not just your son-in-law.
[1628.42] Let me fulfill
the responsibility of being your son.
[1631.85] That's it, Mama.  Everything will be fine.
I'm here, I'll take care of everything now.
[1636.06] You're not here.  My dear, go home and
pack.  You have to go to Turkey tomorrow.
[1641.40] Are you going to go with that worried face?
[1643.81] what are you talking about?  I'm going to
go on vacations, are you leaving like this?
[1648.55] No, Rameen.
[1650.25] Umar, Shahzar, please talk to her.
[1653.92] She has gone mad.
[1655.93] You don't have to change the plan
because of me, dear.
[1659.11] Rameen is absolutely right.
[1661.44] We can postpone the Turkey trip
until you are better.
[1665.42] -Once you get better, we'll go.  Simple.
- Exactly.
[1669.41] It's as simple as that.
[1672.04] No.
[1702.62] Yes, how is the health of our mother-in-law?
[1706.70] This is not good.
Her condition is very critical.
[1709.80] Obviously the cancer is in the last stage.
[1711.93] There is no chance of survival,
only a miracle can save her.
[1715.77] I don't understand
why they won't take her abroad.
[1720.27] We'll foot the bill, we'll take her,
consult a good specialist.
[1725.26] No, I've offered to take her
to a specialist, but they're refusing.
[1728.79] They are self-respecting people.
[1730.45] They say they will pay
for any treatment themselves.
[1735.12] Rameen didn't come back with you?
[1738.02] She will stay with her mother today.
[1740.81] What about Turkey?
[1744.35] Obviously the plan is cancelled.
[1747.66] Oh.
[1751.52] It was a good plan.
[1761.78] Everything is solved by itself.
I don't have to do anything.
[1781.46] This is a very good news!
[1783.76] That's why their trip is cancelled.
[1787.25] You are right.  We don't have to
worry anymore.
[1790.25] Thank God it got cancelled.
[1792.09] But did you see how off Shahzar's mood was?
[1797.26] Of course.
[1798.63] I don't understand what's happening.
He's slipping out of my hands.
[1802.32] Just imagine.  At breakfast,
I was informed that they were going!
[1807.53] He never did anything without my
permission before.  He didn't even breathe.
[1811.70] But now, all the planning is done
without telling me, he didn't even ask me.
[1823.22] -Oh, Mamu is calling from Dubai.
- From Dubai?
[1826.87] I sent him for some work.  Hello.
[1829.21] Yes, what's the update?
[1832.28] Okay, that's right.  No, no, no.
No one should get involved in this.
[1836.12] Don't tell anyone, not even the police.
When is he arriving?
[1840.77] Oh, you'll get your prize.
Of course you will.  A big prize.
[1844.79] All right.
[1846.64] Okay.  Goodbye.
[1848.52] We know about Kamran.
He's coming on Friday at 11 pm.
[1852.26] Really?
[1854.05] Oh, don't involve the police there.
[1856.93] Tell Qayyum to send his people
to pick him up.
[1861.35] Make sure to get the divorce
papers signed immediately
[1865.38] so that Manal's life can be saved.
[1868.68] Let me just get a hold of him!
[1875.61] My dear, go home and pack;
you have to leave for Turkey tomorrow.
[1879.30] What are you saying? 
[1880.89] How can I go on a vacation, leaving you
like this?
[1886.41] How could you be so
careless in my matter, Rameen?
[1890.93] You cancelled the plan so easily.
[1894.49] You didn't even take
the time to consult me.
[1897.72] I was so excited
[1900.48] about this vacation.
[1902.90] I thought we'd have
such a good time together.
[1905.80] I thought you loved me, but today
you've shattered this false illusion.
[1912.19] You only care about your family.
[1915.54] You only love them.
[1918.29] It feels like I don't
even exist in your life.
[1947.84] I hope I didn't disturb you.
[1953.70] Khala said you crave coffee at this time.
[1960.11] Rameen isn't at home.
[1963.21] So I thought I...
[1966.03] should make coffee for my handsome cousin.
[1976.62] You've gone out of your way for no reason.
[1980.68] My advice would be not to bother
with this from now on.
[1986.55] Rameen always makes coffee for me,
and I only like the coffee she makes.
[1993.07] You can forget about that.
[1997.99] I mean, her mother is unwell,
she can't leave her.
[2005.09] By the way...
[2006.81] I've been thinking about something lately.
[2011.80] What?
[2014.17] As much as you love Rameen...
[2017.06] she doesn't love you even
20% as much as you love her.
[2020.24] I know this might upset you,
but it's the truth.
[2025.34] She loves her parents
more than she loves you.
[2029.50] Didn't you notice?
[2030.74] Since she moved into
this house after marriage,
[2033.08] the happiness and affection
on her face are gone.
[2038.21] This is not what I’m saying,
but the elders say... that
[2041.71] women who are tangled
in their family issues...
[2046.08] they cannot care for their in-laws...
[2050.63] or their husbands.
[2057.15] Thanks.
[2059.11] Thank you for the coffee.
[2062.12] Please go inside.
[2065.23] Okay, here it is.
[2067.29] If you need anything, I'll be up.
[2071.66] Yes, all right.
[2074.84] Yes, all right.
[2123.94] You didn't tell us she's a cancer patient.
[2134.48] The tumor has been removed, but the cancer
has spread throughout her body.
[2144.51] What did the doctors say?
Will Mehru survive?
[2149.66] The doctors have given up. Take
[2159.01] her to a good hospital
so she can get treated in time.
[2163.21] However, they might suggest surgery
right away. 
[2166.20] So, please mentally prepare for that.
[2173.11] The doctors say there’s
no point in treating her now. 
[2175.91] Any treatment will be very expensive. 
[2178.90] If I have to sell myself, I will.
But no one is willing to buy me either.
[2184.26] What should I do? he cancer has spread
[2188.53] throughout
her body, and it’s difficult to control.
[2192.43] But with timely treatment and prayer,
it can be managed. 
[2198.51] Pray for her that she survives. 
[2200.92] Just like she fought cancer,
God will have mercy on us.
