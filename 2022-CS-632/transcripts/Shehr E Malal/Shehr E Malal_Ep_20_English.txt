You've gone out of your way for no reason. Rameen always makes coffee for me,
and I only like the coffee she makes. You can forget about that. What are the doctors saying?
Will Mehru survive? The doctors have given up. Mama, why did you reject their offer? You know Baba's financial situation. He doesn't have any property that
he can sell to fund your treatment. For the last time, for my sake,
just listen to me.  Please. Please, please, please. Here we go. Please don't make childish demands. This is not socially unacceptable. A girl's family never asks for help
from her in-laws. Mom... they are very well-off. A sum of 10-15 lakhs won't matter to them. Sure, they have wealth. We have no right over their wealth, right? Look. Shahzar's mother herself called me. I know she seems very bitter,
but her heart is very pure. She assured me that she will
get you treated in the best hospital. Rameen, please. Please stop defending my mother-in-law
and focus on your husband. Why? Do you think he is not happy with me? What was the need to cancel the
Turkey trip without asking Shahzar? He was very upset when he left. Mama... right now, I am more worried about
your health than Shahzar's anger. We have our whole life to travel
and explore. Keep it down. When girls get married, Rameen, their husband and in-laws become the
most important in their lives. What do I have in your life now?
I'm here today, I won't be here tomorrow. But your entire life is ahead of you. Focus on your home, Rameen. Take care of your in-laws
and your husband. Make him happy.
Otherwise, he will get frustrated. - Do you understand?  -Yes
. - I love you.
- I love you. This is Kamran's flight details. Now what should we do? what else? His plane will land here at 11.
Our people need to be at the airport by 10, and as soon as he comes out, it should be as you wish. I hate him.  The only thing that bothers
me is that I can't punish him. He deceived me so easily
and you did nothing. Why? He needs to be punished.
He needs to know who he deceived. I'll take him to the gallows.
I won't be at peace until then. I'll go to hell to find him,
but he will be punished. Mehru. Come. I have brought breakfast for you.
Let me feed you.  I'll have the soup first. -Come on.
- Umar, please listen to me. will you listen to me? Whether you tell me or not... I know I don't have much time left. Please, don't waste any more money
on my treatment. Please. I want to spend my last
moments with you at home, not in any hospital. Mehru, do you know anything? In fact, I'm sure you know it. We've been together for so many years. But funnily enough, I’ve never
thought of my life without you. Neither have I. I haven't had a moment without your
thoughts, your memories.  Without you. Everyone has to leave this world, and they have to go at the time fixed
for them. But should we give up on everything? Shouldn't we try? Shouldn't we have hope,
shouldn't we get treatment? Fine, we won't go to the hospital. We can still treat you at home. Get up.  Let's have breakfast. Have some soup.  Come on,
sit a little further.  Good! - I won't eat the egg.
- I won't feed you eggs, come on. Show a little bit of strength.  Come on. Sir, you didn't mention where we are going. I need to go to the railway station. - We'll reach in 30 minutes, right?
- Yes, sir, we will reach.  Don't worry. Here comes our car. Look at this and get in.   Get in! -What are you doing?  Leave me!
-Shut up!  Sit quietly. Easy! Please, Rameen, keep it down.
I'll have it later. It will get cold anyway.  Besides, Dado
said to make you eat the whole soup. I'm not so ill
that I can't have my own soup. Mama, I am very upset with you. You never gave Shahzar and I a chance
to help you. He thinks you don't consider him your son. It's not like that. I didn't refuse treatment
for the reasons you think. The doctors say it's very
necessary for you to be admitted. Cancer can spread. I don't want to go through
chemotherapy again. If that treatment doesn't help, then
why should I endure so much pain? - Have you become so hopeless?
- I am not hopeless. I am being realistic. I heard what the doctor said, dear. What can happen at most? I might survive for only two more years
with chemotherapy. What's the point? I won't completely get better. Amma, please don't say such things. Have some mercy on me. You all should realize one thing. We all will die one day, dear. I know who's putting all this nonsense
in your head. what does he think?  Do I not know
how honest and self-respecting he is? Mama, I'm going to talk to him today. - You will not do such a thing, Rameen.
-Why? If I won't do it now
then when will I do it? -You won't stop me today.  That's it.
- Rameen-- Shahzar and Shahnawaz
should not know about this. You don't have to worry about that.
They won't find out. Also, I have kept Kamran locked up. I was thinking if we could hand him over
to the police. I thought about it.  I had the same plan,
but I changed my mind. How long will it take for him to get bail?
He must have strong connections too. He's well connected too. No. I won't allow the man who hurt Minal
to walk around freely. Never! Look, you're being emotional. The biggest benefit of this will be
getting your jewellery and money back. I don't care about that.
I don't need anything. I only care about Minal. I want to take revenge
for the pain she's gone through. Revenge for every single tear she shed. Oh, God, grant my Mehru a long life. If you want, you can give her
all the moments of my life. But please save my Mehru. How can I watch her approach death
every moment? I don't have the strength. Oh, God, please save my Mehru. Have mercy on her.  Do you want to kill her? Why don't you understand
that she's useless to you now? She can't help you anymore. When my in-laws are saying they'll get
her treated, then why are you objecting? A woman who supported you her whole life, who stood with you throughout everything, you're not
supporting her at this time? Seriously? What have you given her except stress
her whole life? Say it. Say whatever there is in your heart today.
I want to hear it. - Rameen.
- One minute, Mehru. Let me talk to her today. Today, I want everything
in your heart to come out. Everything is in your mind that is doubt.
I want to answer all of it. -You go inside.
-No, no.  why are you sending her away? She won't go anywhere. Whatever is to be said,
it will be in front of her. And you're going to answer in front of her
about why you're doing all this. Tell me, what's her fault?
Why won't you let her get treated? Why won't I let her get treated? I got her treated all her life. But if I need to sell myself to
treat her now, I'm ready for that too. The only thing I can't do
is compromise my pride. - That I can't ask your in-laws--
- Stop it. Stop!  Please stop!  I've given this
lecture about pride way too many times. It doesn't suit you.  what do you think?
I don't know anything?  Am I a fool?  -That I don't see everything?
- Rameen! You think I'm a fool and don't see what
you say behind my back to my mother-in-law? You're calling her, asking her to pay
all your debts, she's getting you a job, you-- One minute, one minute.  Relax.
Who told you that I am calling her? Do you think I'm a kid, I'm a fool? That I don't know anything? The job you're so proud of these days,
my mother-in-law got you that job. Otherwise, your reputation is so bad now
that no one will-- anyway. I didn't come here to fight. I came to tell you that don't stay under the
delusion that I will let you stay here... in this conditions. Tomorrow evening, I will come
with Shahzar to pick Mama up. I'll take her from here.  And that's final. You've cut it so well. But the flowers are all old.
Plant some new ones. The soil needs to be changed
since the season has changed. So I have to plant new flowers now. All right, fine, but do it
so you can plant the flowers.  -Yes .  -Make
sure it looks beautiful.  Come on. -Yeah, I'll call you the soil guy now.
- Right.  Okay. Rameen. My dear, why are you crying? Nothing. What is it?  Tell me. What is it? Is Mehr-un-Nisa okay? She's barely alive. what are you saying? Child, we'll all pray for her. She will get better soon. Phuppo, the doctors have given up. Nothing can be done. No doctor in the world can save my mother. Phuppo, my mother is dying,
and I can't do anything. No, dear, don't say that. Don't say that, dear. You'll see.  We'll all pray for her. She will get better soon. My child! Come here.  Just pray. Pray for your mother.  God will listen. What did Rameen say? I got this job... through Tabinda's reference. And you, Mehru, you knew about it. You hid it from me.  But why? I got to know about it very late. You were so excited that you finally
found a good job. I didn't want to make you sad. I will resign from this job tomorrow. I can't take any favors from this woman. Omar, just listen to me. Both of us know that Tabinda
is a very bad woman. But her heart isn't so rotten. Do you remember... when Rameen tried to commit suicide
and the media attacked you? who saved us? She was the one who convinced her husband
to let Shahzar marry our daughter, right? Listen, don't let your ego and anger... give in to the idea of ​​resignation. Rameen is already so upset with you.
If you do this, she'll be even more upset. This isn't my ego. This is my stubbornness. I won't take any favors from that woman.  It doesn't matter what. - Did you order something for him?
- Yeah, it'll be delivered soon. Oh, here it comes. Get water also. Sit, man.  Look, I'm losing. Here! Eat. Who are you people?  Why have you
brought me here?  what do you want? Untie me! By tonight, you'll know who we
are and why we brought you here. -Eat it.
-Untie me! Eat it, you'll die. Eat! Untie my hands.  how am I gonna eat? Eat it as you normally do.  We'll
have to beat him up to make him eat. Eat your good. Come on, come on, come on. I told you, I'm losing.
You've made it worse. Come on, man. - I can't eat it!
-Come on, son, eat! Just eat how you've eaten up
other people's money. 5, you're out.  Take a side, come on! Come on, you're out. Sabra! Razia! Fazlu?  Where have you all gone
and died? What's the issue?  Huh? Why are you shouting and calling everyone?
They are not your servants... that they will come running if you call. I know exactly how to talk to whom. You don't need to teach me manners,
watch your film! Girl, you are a guest in this
house for just a few days. My daughter gave you a place in her home, and now you think you're the
mistress of this house? Hello!  Who do you think you are?  Do you think you're the mistress
of this house? This is my daughter's house, and my
son-in-law has kept me here like family. do you understand?
Now, stay within your limits. You are crossing your limits now.  It ruined my mood. Where is everyone? Such a big drama, this idiot. why did you bring me here?
I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.
why did you bring me here? Who brought me here? -Who brought me here?  -I
brought you here! Now, you must have understood
why you were brought here. Tell me! Tell me, why did you do this to Minal? Speak up!  Why did you deceive her? Why did you betray her? She loved you with all her heart,
and this is how you repaid her. Please forgive me! I will take revenge for every tear
Minal shed. I will account for each one of them. - I am not one to forgive easily.
- Please forgive me. You are not worthy of being forgiven. what do you think?  You're going to be
punished for what you've done. I will not let you go so easily, do
you understand? Beat him up. Beat him, beat him so much that he will never again be able to destroy
an innocent girl's life. But, Tabinda, his family has already filed
a report with the police, so if they reach here,
it will cause trouble for us. I don't care. He is going to die.  Look, we've
punished him, he's also apologizing... There's no news of Kamran.
We're very worried. His wedding is in two days. His phone is off too. I thought I'd call and ask you. Maybe you'd know something about him.
Have you been in touch with him? My relationship ended with him the
moment you told me about his engagement. Anyway, when did he come back from Dubai? He came back yesterday.
He's been missing ever since. I've filed a missing person's report
with the police. I thought I'd ask you;
maybe you've had some contact with him. Fine.  I'll let you know. If you find anything out,
let me know immediately too. Hello, I need to talk to you
about something very important. What's the urgent matter? Do you need money or something? I can help you catch Kamran,
but on one condition. Khala can't know about it. How do you know Kamran? Be careful, dear. I don't want you to get involved in
any trouble while seeking revenge. And tell Qayyum to stop torturing Kamran. If he died or something,
we'll be in a serious situation. Then his family will file
a murder case against you. I feel like shooting him with my own hands! Oh, have you gone mad?
Do you want to ruin your life? I say, take your money back from him
and let him go. Don't create new trouble for yourself
by taking his life. Then it's a whole new drama. I can't let him go so easily. Mr.  Umar, it's only been a few months
since you joined our company. And you've already resigned. Me and the whole company
are really happy with your work. I... Sir, I really appreciate it,
but I have some family issues. My wife, she's not well actually. I feel like she really needs me
and in these conditions, it'll be very hard for me to continue this
job, sir. I do understand it.
I feel very sorry for that. For your wife, specially. But the thing is, I cannot accept
your resignation in such a hurry. Do one thing.  Go home, take some time to think
about this matter thoroughly. If you want, take a few days off. But, you see, I just assigned
you to the China project, and I can't trust anyone
else with it right now. I heard you resigned. Yes, you heard it correctly. But Mr.  Baqar hasn't
accepted your resignation yet. Thank you for referring me for this job,
but I had a request. After today, please don't do me
or my family any favors. If you do something for your own family,
that's not a favor. Whatever you did with me, don't worry, I wo
n't do anything like that to you. I ended the relationship. But my mother and I weren't unfair to you. Just a relationship? What could be more unfair
than ending that relationship? Anyway, why are we discussing this now? The most important thing right now
is your job. I request that you withdraw
your resignation. Mr.  Baqar has also asked me
to talk to you. I need to talk to you
about something important. Is it possible to meet at the same
coffee shop where we met last time? I’d like to talk to you as well,
but unfortunately, I have some important prior
commitments this evening. How about tomorrow?
We will meet tomorrow, in the day. Okay. Okay, good bye. Leaving your job was not a wise decision. You really need this job
in these circumstances. You got this great opportunity
with a lot of effort, and now you've resigned. If I had known earlier... that this job came through Tabinda's
reference, I would have never accepted it. I'm surprised that Rameen hid such a big
thing from me.  Mehru didn't tell me either. What do I do? You know that she doesn't do anything
without a reason. But given our current situation... now we... we need to think ahead. Forget the past. It's better for all of us. Think about the present and future. How do I forget it?  Tell me. Do you remember what Abbu used to say? If a woman loves,
she destroys herself for that love. And if she hates,
she destroys the other person. Tabinda... Tabinda wants to take revenge
on me for every bit of life... she’s imagined getting back at me for. She has reached a point where she
can't hear anything nor understand. I expect everything from her, Ammi Ji.
