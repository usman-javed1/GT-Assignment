I'm coming to Pakistan
the day after tomorrow. What? You've taken control over everything
anyway! You caused my children
to become estranged from me. You're right, he's not my blood. But how can you deny the fact
that I stay awake at nights for him? I've loved him more
than a biological mother! I'm sorry.  Actually,
I told him you're coming, I think his meeting ran late.
He's on the way, he's coming. I understand.
It happens.  It's not a big deal. - No problem!
- Oh, Baba!  You're here! - I know I'm late.  I'm so sorry!
- Baba, we waited so long for you. Umar, this is Tabinda.  This is Shahzar. - Salam, Uncle.
- And Shahzar's sister, Manal. Auntie, are you okay? - Mom!
- Oh, God! Mom!  Mom?  What happened? - Nothing, nothing.
- Auntie, are you okay? - I'll get water.
- Yes, please. I'll get water. Mom?  Mom, what happened to you?
Are you okay? Can we go now?  We'll come back later. - Right now?
- I'm not feeling well.  Please. We're really sorry.  We... we'll have to go. She's unwell.  I think we'll have to go
to the hospital. - I can call the doctor--
- No, there's no need. We'll come again, God willing. Careful. Bring her back.  Careful. Why did she become light-headed? Where did they go? - Go, see them off.
- Okay. It was just a little light-headedness. The doctor was saying that... you're going through a severe depression
right now. This is nothing new. It's an old thing.  Since ages. I know what's the reason
for this depression. Dad and his mocking tone. His continuous accusations that... you're responsible for his disability. If you say so, I can talk to him... No. Don't say anything to him. He stays away from me anyway. He thinks I've created distance
between him and his son. That's a lie. You didn't do any such thing. It's true that I've become
distanced from him, but his behavior is the only reason
for that, nothing else. Yes, but don't go and tell him now. You know his temperament;
He will move heaven and earth. His temperament is the ocean's waves. It comes and goes just like that. Just watch.  As soon as I go inside, he'll specifically call me over
and inquire about your health. However he is, he really cares about you. What's going on?  Why are you so quiet? Aren't you happy to hear about my job? Such an ordinary job? What do I do about it?  Should I put
flower garlands around your neck? Oh, man! You know how hard it was to get it? And it's a big deal to find jobs like these
in this time, madam. Look at your standard and look at this! You're an MBA and this is a clerk level job? You know you're highly qualified. You know what my mother says? My mother says that money
comes from a woman's fortune. Just let us be married once.
Then you'll see. I don't believe in such
orthodox things at all. A person creates everything with their
intellect, understanding, and planning. Right!  So you're calling my mother
orthodox? You know that I'm practical.
You have so many responsibilities. How will you follow through with these? Since you waited so long for a good
job, we could have waited a little longer. I couldn't have waited any longer.
You know all the responsibilities I have. My mother is sick,
I have to get my sisters married, God knows what else. Responsibilities, responsibilities,
responsibilities. You fulfill your responsibilities.
I can't live in such a tense situation. Just forget about-- Forget me! Tabo-- Tabo, listen to me! Tabinda! - Listen to me at least.
- I don't want to hear it. - If you won't listen to me then how--
- Leave my hand! Why do you get so upset? You know that I can't
tolerate your displeasure, yet you keep getting
upset repeatedly. Look, Tabinda, I can't provide you
with a comfortable life. But I promise I'll give you my
complete trust and all my love. - You'll never have any reason to complain.
- I don't have any complaints about you. It's just that you don't want
to move forward. You don't want to work hard. You make so many grand promises
about love;  How will you fulfill them? Huh?  If you're going to work hard right
now, then you'll reap the fruits later. What do you mean?  I don't work hard?
I don't want to get ahead in life? If you wanted to move forward,
would you have lost the opportunity in Dubai? Come on!  For God's sake, Tabinda. I can't leave my old,
sick mother and move to Dubai! Then leave me! Tabinda! What happened? Nothing. You're lying to me? Can I lie to you? Now you'll tell me you
have a headache to distract me. Bring me a cold glass of water. Not just a glass of water,
headache medicine too. I'll get it. By the way, I found Shahzar's mother
to be a very weird woman. I insisted so much that they stay
for tea, she took the kids and left. And she didn't say a word
about your proposal. Mama, she wasn't well.
That's why she had to leave. Otherwise I'm sure she would've stayed. It feels to me like she doesn't want to send
the proposal to us at all. And she only came because her son insisted. Mom. She's a businesswoman. So she just got sick because of work stress
and she left. And besides, Shahzar said
he'll bring her again next week. I have much more experience than you
when it comes to these things. This is how mothers of only sons are. Way too possessive and insecure. They're only happy when their children
are doing exactly what they want. Didn't you see? How much he was flattering his own mother. One second. When did you start
talking like typical women? Did I say something wrong, Umar? Umar? Did I say something wrong? No. They were good people. Where have you been since last night? I asked you something else
and you're saying something else entirely. I have to make an important call.
I'll be back in a minute. What happened, Shahnawaz? You seem a little off. Did something happen? Tabinda is also in a sour mood. When did we last talk? If something happened... then it was either an argument
or a fight. That's it. I've been noticing... that the distance between you two
is only growing. Now Tabinda has even separated her room. Oh, dear, that beautiful smile of yours
that I occasionally get to see, - I've written a poem about it.
- Really? You've started poetry as well? Never before did I pen a verse;
It's your love that turned me into a poet. Read it out then. Yes, I'll read it to you, of course I will,
but after you've made me a promise. Promise me that you'll never leave me,
that you'll always stay with me. Because with you, the idea of ​​life
is nothing more than a bad dream. So promise me that you'll never leave me. And if you leave me, then? Man, you leaving me is a possibility. I'll never leave you.  That's my promise.
Now promise me. - By the way, my parents really liked you.
- Really? They're seriously thinking
about your proposal. Wow. But I... I'm really worried
about something. What happened? Man, I was thinking that... if... if Mom liked you... then I'll have to marry you. What do you mean?
You don't want to get married? No, no.  It's not like that. Don't misunderstand me.
I have to get married. But try to understand.  If I marry you,
what else will there be left to do? Shahzar, you scare me sometimes. Look, man, it's very simple. It's only you that I wanted from life. And if I get you, why would I
raise my hands to pray then? Stop reciting poetry and focus on the road. There's one thing though. Only a girl like you would try to get
out of such a romantic situation and would ask to focus on the road. By the way, if Mama found out that I'm with
you instead of being at the university, she'll scold me a lot.
Now drop me straight to the university. What?  Don't tell me you're going
to university now. Yes! Oh, tell me something. Auntie didn't say anything about me? No, we didn't talk and honestly,
I didn't ask her anything either. I'm sure everything will be fine.
I think she'll like you. Besides, she knows that I like you. She won't ever say no. - Should I drop you to the university or--
- Yes. Rude. A proposal came through last week.
I need some information about that man. - Are you talking about Umar Hassan?
- Yes, about him. But we've already rejected that proposal. Not about the proposal, about him. What kind of information do you need?
I don't understand. I want to know everything about him. How many companies does he have,
and where are his properties located? Are they in Pakistan or abroad? On whose names is it?
And everything about his personal life. You'll have to do this carefully
if you want that brand new car of yours. Madam. I can do anything for a brand new car. - Okay, then.  Start working.
- I'll get on it. Umar? God. How is your headache now? I don't know, man.  This... It feels as if this pain is going to
take me with it. It just doesn't end. Umar, I've noticed that... ever since the topic of Rameen's proposal has come up... your worries have
 started since then. No, dear.  It's not like that. What are you hiding from me? What will I hide from you?
I'm not hiding anything. You always do this. Whenever you're worried, you get quiet instead of
sharing your worries with me. How do you read my face? How do you know what's in my heart? Because I love you. Am I worthy of your love? Why are you saying that? In these 22 years, the love and respect
that you've given me... my love is nothing in front of that. - Umar, your favors--
- Where did favors come from? You're my wife. My life partner. If we don't help each other, take care of
each other, then who will? Then share your worries with me. Oh, dear, it's nothing.  It's just... some worries about the business. Ever since we've come here... nothing has gone right. I've tried to make a lot of business deals, but none of them have gone through. I've submitted tenders at a lot of places, but it seems as if someone has
put evil eye on us. It's a new city.  It'll take a little time
to build new contacts and gain their trust. I think I made a mistake. This city didn't suit us. You made a mistake. You didn't listen to me.
How many times did I tell you? There was no need to get my treatment done
from abroad.  You wasted millions. Now we only have this house. This money, this property, this business... whose was it?  It is yours. Not mine, ours. Okay, let's believe that for a second. Then tell me what was a better use
of this money than this? - You were getting your treatment, right?
- I think that... Rameen is our only daughter.
We should think about her future. There should be some savings for her. What do you think,
should we transfer this house to her name? A daughter's happiness
is not dependent on these papers. If you want to give her something, then... give her your blessings. That God blesses her fate. - Amen.
- But if you still want that, then do it. Is it possible that you ask me to
do a task, and I don't do it? I've got all the reports about Umar Hassan.
I'll just tell you. Umar Hassan had an advertising firm
in Lahore. That's in loss right now. And he has a garment factory
in Karachi. That has been sold now. And he has paid off all his loans
after selling it. And yes, his wife has a house in Lahore,
a 3-kanal house. That's also been sold. Well, if I say that poor Umar
Hassan is currently facing hardships, I wouldn't be wrong. Why was all of it sold though? Oh, it's a very sad and depressing story. Umar Hassan's wife suffers
from blood cancer. And that poor woman goes abroad
for her treatment again and again. Umar Hassan takes her abroad. You know how much money is spent
on medical treatments. On the one hand,
money was spent on her treatment. And on the other hand, when he was busy with
his wife, he didn't give time to office. He made wrong decisions. Loss over loss over loss. He has done everything
and this is his condition now. Shahzar, I don't think your mom
liked me at all. Because ever since she left,
she didn't speak to me or call me. She didn't talk to you either. No, man, it's not like that at all.
You're thinking it the wrong way. She's just occupied.
She's very stressed right now. She's busy with the business,
it's work.  It's nothing like that. I've been hearing these excuses
since the last 2 weeks. Okay, hear me out. Shahzar, if a new proposal came for me, and my parents said yes,
so please don't blame me. They're in a hurry.
I've told you about my mother's illness. Relax.  You just need to relax. I'll talk to her today. In fact, I'll bring her to your house
over the weekend.  All right? Fix your mood, man.  Talk to me. - Talk to me.
- What do I talk about? Say anything.  We've
come here to talk, right? Okay, fine.  You let it be and don't talk. I'll see it in your eyes
what you want to say. Really? You read people's eyes and faces? There's one person in this world
whose eyes and face I can read and know - what they want to say.
- Who is it? There's somebody.  Someone really special. And coincidentally,
she's with me right now. Actually, you should've ordered
their special tea. No, I'm fine with my coffee. May I come in? You? Sit down. I didn't expect this from
a refined person like you. That you'll come to someone's office
without permission. - Maybe you don't know that I--
- I know! That you're the owner of this company. You didn't change at all in the 22 years. Same anger. Same attitude. Yes. If something has changed, then... it's just your status. Your status also changed.  A long time ago. I know you... you're upset with me. I have treated you very badly. Excuse me.  You lost the right to address
me so frankly a very long time ago. - Remember that.
- I'm... really sorry for that. My time is very precious, you... state why have you come here. Don't you have the custom of offering tea? It's been a long time since I had tea
with you. Send one tea.  Quickly, please. Why have you come here? Do you intend to rub
salt in the wounds again? I've come here to apologize to you. Forgive me if it's possible. I know that... I've hurt your heart. But you also know what
the situation was then. Saying sorry... the humiliation and disgrace
that I and my family have endured... can it be rectified? No. Never. But you possess a lot of generosity. You can forgive me if you want. Your mistake is not worth forgiving. But it's humans that make mistakes, right? You made a mistake too. Sometimes, time and life make
decisions that seem beyond our control, and happiness feels like
it is slipping away from us. But it is time that confirms whether those
decisions were perhaps correct, and... we're happier now than before. It seems as if you're very happy
with your life. And should be.
After all, your wife is a very rich woman. Right as you married her,
your status changed overnight. And what could I have given
you except for love? And love is a meaningless thing, right? Rejecting my love and choosing a life of
comfort was your wise decision. I acknowledge it. Indeed, praise should be
given to your intelligence. You were once just an ordinary accountant. And now you're an owner of
such a big company, touch wood. God gave you everything
that you dreamed of. Wrong. I didn't dream of anything.
Nor do I want money. I had never dreamed of wealth;
It was you who desired it. You weren't satisfied
with that ordinary job I had. You made fun of me. You never missed a single day
without taunting me about my poverty. Wrong!  Absolutely wrong! You did not have the desire to advance. If you had wanted to, you could have
achieved everything on your own strength. But no.  You rejected me,
you rejected my love. And you took shortcuts to acquire wealth. You married your boss's
daughter to seize her wealth? My mother was sick. I had to marry off my sisters. You couldn't say a few words of love to me
during all these hardships. But you never missed a chance to taunt me. Anyway, I... I didn't come here to say all of this.
I just... You came to talk about
Rameen and Shahzar, right? Our children like each other. I only came here to say
that is it not possible... for our children's happiness,
we forget the bitterness between us? I should commend you though.
You are a very smart businessman. Measuring relationships in
terms of wealth and business is a practice of people like you, not mine. 22 years ago, you rejected me
and made a deal with Mehrunnisa's father. And now, to manage the declining
state of your business, you have come running to me. Understand this one thing. Your daughter
can't become my daughter-in-law. Please find another wealthy client for her. Ms.  Tabinda. My daughter is my honor. She is my pride. You were right about one thing.
That now... my daughter will not become
your daughter-in-law. It's good that we had a
frank discussion today. May you be blessed with
this comfortable life of yours. - It's such a lovely picture.
- Yeah. This is the best picture from your wedding. You look so happy.
And Baba looks so upset. Don't you know your father?
He's always been serious. But I never saw such a serious face before. Mama, both of you are so different
from each other. But you have such a successful marriage. You know, child, marriages aren't successful
because your temperaments match. A marriage is successful if... the husband and wife trust each other. It's all about loyalty and respect. Was it a love marriage? Arranged. You know this... your dad was an accountant
in my dad's office. Baba was really impressed by him... by Umar's loyalty and honesty. He felt as if there was no better
partner for me than Umar. I know you both love each other a lot. But it's just that sometimes I
look at the two of you, I feel as if... as if something's missing. As if he... the understanding the couples have,
the friendship... I feel the two of them are missing that, I do
n't know why. And as practical and serious Baba is, you're a typical housewife. I'm really sorry to say this. - But Baba is very boring.
- But he's an amazing man. I don't know how you coped with him. It's your courage. He's such an introvert though. I'm taking this, that's it. Yours, God willing. - Salam!
- Hello, Dad. Understand this one thing.  Your
daughter can't become my daughter-in-law. Please find another wealthy client for her. Umar? What's wrong?  Are you okay? Yeah. Will you get me a glass of water? Of course. You're listening to this ghazal
after a very long time. You? When did you come? How are you feeling? You're asking me? Who else is here except you and I? You've asked me this question
after a very long time. Maybe... there's something work related
you want to talk about or maybe... there must be some very important documents
you want signed. As selfish as you think I am... I'm not that selfish. We've gotten distanced because
of these things that you say. Stop nursing grievances. Come to the point. The important thing is that... you should also try to forget
what has happened. For the kids' sake. The situation at home
has become very tense. You're saying that? I'm worried about you. I'll make coffee for you.
