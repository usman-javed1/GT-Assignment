[7.08] Mera dil to shahar
[10.08] malaal
[11.84] hai, what has she come to ask from me, the happiness of your daughter, who for the
[15.48] past two years you have been
[18.24] playing the game of hide and seek, stop it, I have no
[22.96] interest in taking your life,
[25.04] sign and if I don't, then
[36.32] you are taking revenge of Umar Hasan's infidelity from his daughter,
[39.16] this is not love but hatred,
[43.00] Ta Binda, in fact if there is any emotion bigger than hatred, then it is in
[45.96] your heart for Umar,
[49.32] your love for Umar was never true,
[52.52] perhaps that is why today you are not together, because
[60.32] revenge is on your head, she
[63.12] cannot love with a true heart, to
[65.00] love one needs a very big heart,
[69.08] which you don't have
[72.03] [Music],
[76.44] just remember one thing of mine, Ta
[79.76] Banda, the game of hatred that you have started, the
[83.28] loss will be yours only
[87.53] [Music]
[101.01] [Music]
[103.72] I admit that
[106.84] I have been very unfair to your daughter
[110.63] [Music] I do
[115.28] n't know what had happened to me, I had become
[120.12] blind after wealth
[122.51] [Music]
[125.36] I could not even appreciate a girl like her,
[130.52] I am very greedy  I had gone, I had made a
[137.28] big mistake, I have
[141.24] no right to live,
[144.60] I am yours and you
[151.32] can punish me as you want,
[154.16] but
[156.68] please believe me that I
[160.80] love Minal a lot
[165.76] and I realized this when
[168.60] I went away from her life, if I do
[171.12] n't
[171.92] get her, I will die, I am
[175.44] requesting you
[185.76] [Music]
[191.84] [Music]
[199.22] [Music]
[205.08] Hey, if he has to die, then die, spare the life of our daughter
[208.36] and I am surprised at you brother,
[211.44] how did you forgive her, if
[214.44] Shajar hears this, he will be angry with you, even if the
[217.08] world turns upside down, he will never forgive
[220.44] and Manal will die while she is alive, I
[224.20] know this is not an easy decision, it is
[231.12] very difficult to be with a person like him again, but then I
[234.52] think about Manal's future,
[236.52] but you do
[239.28] not need to worry about Manal's future and Mashallah
[242.60] Minal is not an ordinary girl, hey,
[245.76] after divorce, so many good proposals will come for her that
[248.28] you will keep waiting, I know her very well and
[252.56] someone else  I will never be able to be happy after marrying him I have somehow
[261.20] lived my life by compromising
[265.04] but I will not let this happen with Naal She has
[270.36] full right to her share of happiness and
[273.64] I will give her this happiness at any cost no matter what happens
[280.32] Hello, she came and
[283.52] died,
[288.68] yes,
[290.36] okay, again the same thing, what's the
[302.64] problem, I have been calling you since so long, why were you
[310.72] not
[313.08] picking up the phone, what's the matter, why do you
[315.12] look so worried, and what is this matter of Kamran's kidnapping, his
[317.40] mother called, she
[319.56] looked very worried, you have no idea about anything,
[324.04] leave all these things, take care of yourself, pack your things and get out of
[326.96] here, if Kamran sahab
[329.92] tells Tab that you were involved in this whole matter
[332.36] with him, then you can't even imagine
[335.04] what the impact will be on you
[358.66] [Music]
[392.04] [Music]
[398.16] Meru My
[401.36] God, you
[405.12] scared me,
[407.32] you scared me, I thought
[412.00] maybe you were doing a miracle,
[414.28] you thought I am dead, why do you trouble me, you
[420.88] know I am worried,
[423.80] I have lost, I do
[427.32] n't have the courage to listen to your words,
[430.52] I  I want to see you happy.
[434.76] You haven't taken your medicine even today, right? Amma was
[438.72] telling me. You haven't even eaten your food properly. If you keep
[442.16] doing this, then the reason you didn't take the medicine is that there's no
[448.04] use.
[471.40] You didn't eat the food because you haven't lost your appetite. Meru, whatever complaint you have against me, tell me. You can fight with me, talk to me, but don't behave like this. Look, if you don't take your medicine and don't
[474.44] eat like this,
[476.60] then I will be forced to hospitalize you.
[482.28] You had promised me that you wo
[488.64] n't die in the hospital. You want to get
[492.52] well
[495.24] at home.
[499.40] But for that, you will have to
[502.56] eat food and also take medicine. You will have to take
[504.60] care of yourself.
[514.64] Come and relax [
[517.13] Sangeet] I
[521.64] promise
[524.99] [
[535.39] Sangeet] We will take care of my guarantor [Sangeet] Why wo
[536.84] n't I always keep you? Well,
[540.08] we both have a daughter. I also want you as much as
[542.92] you want
[545.77] [Sangeet] I will
[553.68] do whatever you want. You know, I love you a lot. Every
[559.12] moment of my life, every moment that
[562.16] I have spent with you is a
[566.36] very happy memory for me.
[571.72] Every moment of my life with you is filled with fragrance
[574.92] [Sangeet] I
[579.16] remember you for the first time.  I was
[581.84] stunned to see a house, you said
[584.88] I
[588.64] want a house, I just want to see you happy,
[591.80] every
[594.28] moment, every
[596.44] day, there should be a new happiness for you and
[600.88] you just keep smiling. Meru Meru Mehru
[607.04] Ammi Ammi Mehru what happened
[616.24] Mehru Mehru come to your senses Mehru Ammi Mehru Mehru
[619.56] please Mehru look at me
[622.88] Ammi what happened, what happened, look what happened, I should call an
[626.56] ambulance Mehru
[630.00] I am
[632.92] Ruru Ya Allah
[636.28] Ruru Meru Meru
[640.20] Meru
[644.47] [Music]
[664.52] Yaar why are you getting so upset, everything will be
[666.48] fine, she is
[671.56] not feeling bad about this, she is not talking to anyone for a long time, she is not
[674.52] even eating food, what
[677.48] could have happened, it is
[679.04] nothing as you are thinking,
[682.20] you see, we are going now, I am
[684.32] with you, everything will be fine, we are getting her checked by the doctors,
[687.60] right? If the doctor said
[689.96] that she should be treated somewhere outside, then
[691.84] we will take her outside, understand that she is
[694.84] depressed, she is not talking, she
[697.84] talks to someone, she has not even called me,
[703.96] they should go and check on me, I am sure she is
[709.12] fine
[711.72] Shahnawaz
[714.44] Raman must be very worried and sad because of his mother's illness. I
[722.12] cannot see her worry and sadness at all,
[724.12] brother. I had told Umar Hasan sahab
[728.36] that
[730.92] we are ready to bear all the expenses for her treatment.
[732.60] Even if we have to go out of the country, London,
[735.52] America.
[736.44] Weaver Shajar also told him that brother,
[739.36] you can get your wife treated by the best doctor in the country,
[741.80] but no, he refused the offer. I
[745.32] feel that he is not particularly interested in getting his wife treated. Make
[750.16] me talk to Umar sahab, I will make him
[751.80] understand. See, friendship comes in handy in bad times.
[755.36] Life and death are in the hands of Allah, a
[758.84] person should at least try.
[767.60] Hello, yes Shajar, how are you feeling?
[772.56] O
[776.36] Ila. Yes, I will tell you. [Music] I will take Ila to
[787.44] sleep.
[818.36] [
[830.39] Music] What should I do? This is my
[840.72] heart, which has
[844.20] risen from the desert and is deeper than the ocean. Who knows
[854.96] where the pain is?
[859.64] How can I forget the stories that have
[865.68] passed in my heart? No one
[873.96] knows [Music]  Whom should I tell this to
[881.18] [Music] Should I
[883.24] tell it to the condition of my looted heart
[895.24] My heart is in the city of regret My heart is in the city of regret It is a
[904.36] wound that can't be healed
[910.31] [Music]
[910.55] [Praise]
[914.00] No one attacks my heart like this
[921.16] You went away, every happiness has been taken away My breath and
[928.32] life have been snatched away My
[935.16] companion, you have parted
[942.52] Who has played this trick of
[947.28] my heart
[954.40] My heart is in the city of regret [
[971.42] Music] [Music] [
[1001.27] Music]
[1007.86] [Music]
[1013.56] You haven't eaten anything since yesterday
[1016.47] [Music] It
[1021.24] seems
[1024.08] as if Bhoop has also died along with Mehru I
[1035.00] cannot express what my heart is going through Seeing you in this condition
[1038.44] I have lost a daughter-in-law like a daughter
[1042.60] But I don't want to lose my son
[1045.12] If you and Amin
[1048.08] don't control yourselves, then
[1049.64] I will also lose courage Um
[1053.45] [Music] I
[1056.40] can understand your
[1059.80] condition, like a mother, one gets agonized when her
[1062.76] son is in pain
[1066.36] Who knows the hearts of a child better than a mother
[1070.76] But with Mehru's departure, there has been a change in my life  There is a
[1073.92] lack, a void has been created, the
[1076.80] curse that I am going through, the loneliness that
[1079.96] I am going through,
[1081.12] and how do I
[1087.36] explain it to someone, it feels like something has broken inside me, it
[1092.12] feels like someone has pulled my
[1095.72] ribs, nothing is
[1099.68] left, how long will this go on, Omar, how long will you
[1103.92] mourn for father and daughter Meher Nisa
[1106.76] with the dying, the mind does not
[1110.72] wake up, you have to live for
[1114.00] yourself, for
[1115.96] your daughter, there is still a lot of life
[1119.72] left
[1120.74] [Music]
[1125.24] No, I am not
[1127.56] hungry, Ami, I know
[1132.84] why you are not hungry, firstly you are hungry for
[1135.88] Meher Nisa and
[1139.84] you also have this complaint that
[1141.56] her death is because of you, so the
[1144.44] reality is that
[1147.48] I gave her pain, I gave
[1151.48] her humiliation because of me, and she has
[1155.56] left this world,
[1158.76] I will never be able to forgive myself, don't
[1164.56] think like this son, it is nothing like that,
[1170.68] you
[1176.08] married her without your choice on my insistence and after marriage you never gave Meher Nisa
[1181.56] this feeling, that was your
[1185.80] desire, you sacrificed your love for the sake of marrying her,
[1195.28] that is why I say that she  I gave you trouble
[1200.24] because of you,
[1204.12] yes I loved someone before my Nisa,
[1211.76] but the day Mehru came in my life,
[1215.20] after that I never thought of it,
[1218.68] I only loved my Nisa
[1222.12] [sangeet],
[1230.72] I have spent a moment of my life with great honesty with Mehru,
[1235.24] Rami,
[1238.72] listen to me, now
[1242.48] none of your
[1245.04] explanations will affect me
[1248.08] and Dada, I did
[1251.64] not expect this from you,
[1254.96] you knew that he had an affair with some other woman and
[1259.32] because of that my mother left me,
[1263.00] then you are thinking wrong, you do not have any affair, I do not have
[1266.96] anything like that, I am just
[1269.76] remembering Mehri Nisa, Dada, I told you, now
[1273.64] none of your explanations will affect me,
[1276.16] I did not know that you could stoop so low
[1280.16] son, I am telling you, there is no such thing
[1282.00] in my life, I
[1284.88] love no one except your mother,
[1287.00] you are lying, I have heard everything,
[1289.80] standing here,
[1292.00] I can forgive all your mistakes,
[1295.20] I
[1296.36] did, but I can never forgive that
[1299.28] because of some other woman you left me  You hurt my ailing
[1301.68] mother's feelings, I can never forgive you.
[1304.68] Son, don't
[1306.80] go, friend, with such bad intentions, don't even
[1311.96] listen to me. I am not your daughter. I am not your
[1316.24] daughter. There is no
[1319.28] relation between us and you.
[1321.56] Saying this will
[1323.60] not end your relation. This is a blood relation. He is
[1327.40] your father and will remain your mother's
[1330.64] father. If you go away angry like this,
[1333.36] what will the family say? They will talk about their
[1335.68] mother. I will go to my husband
[1338.64] 's house myself.
[1340.00] And if any of you
[1343.76] tries to come there or tries to make contact with me,
[1346.00] then I will leave my husband's house as well.
[1348.54] [Sangeet]
[1349.88] And I will go so far that you people
[1352.04] keep searching for me,
[1354.80] my
[1357.16] son.
[1358.98] [Sangeet]
[1362.96] Rami, what did you understand? [Sangeet] Let's do
[1377.44] it.
[1380.16] [Sangeet] [
[1396.71] Sangeet] [Sangeet]
[1433.39] [Sangeet]
[1451.40] Kamran has fulfilled his promise. Very
[1454.20] soon, he will hand over the jewellery to us,
[1457.36] but for this, he will have to release us.
[1460.28] Let's see if the cheque gets deposited and gets cleared. Then we'll
[1463.44] see. Do you really think that we can trust
[1465.52] him?  We can forgive, look we have to do it, the
[1469.00] reason for that is that he has handed over a huge amount of money to us,
[1471.40] he has also apologised to you,
[1473.92] he is also ashamed of his mistake
[1477.16] and I think he is ashamed and I don't know I am not at all
[1481.28] satisfied,
[1487.76] if he does something like this again
[1491.80] or hurts Minal, I will
[1494.56] not be able to tolerate it and Shahnawaz will never
[1496.68] tolerate it, let the money be settled,
[1499.64] after that get the foreign divorce papers
[1502.08] signed so that I can get Minal out of this torture, has it
[1503.84] ever
[1507.04] happened that you said something and it was not done, by the
[1509.12] way, my personal thought is that
[1513.72] we should forgive Kamran,
[1519.04] look you have to get Minal married somewhere, so
[1524.36] what is the guarantee that the next
[1528.84] person who will come in Minal's life will
[1531.12] not be greedy, what are you saying, how did
[1533.28] you even think like this, I will let that person
[1536.80] come in Minal's life again,
[1540.36] Minal took a wrong step, she was
[1543.68] innocent, not again, never again, you just
[1549.40] get her to sign,
[1550.84] this is it  That is the work which he is
[1554.60] not ready to do brother he is not ready to give divorce
[1557.04] what are you saying I think
[1560.76] you are not able to do this work I will have to do it after doing
[1564.72] all the work you did not do the most
[1568.16] important work what do you
[1571.68] want me to do bring her to your house
[1575.63] [Music] [Music] [Music]
[1664.16] i
[1667.58] [Music] Don't take any chances of
[1703.68] leaving Manal
[1706.04] I don't want anything except Manal look
[1709.04] just give me one chance I
[1712.24] promise you I will do whatever you
[1716.08] say I will be your
[1718.36] slave all my life
[1720.36] but please
[1722.76] please don't separate Minal from me
[1725.76] trusting you means
[1728.96] pushing Minal in a blind well she does
[1731.20] n't like to hear your name I do
[1733.20] n't know what dreams you are seeing don't worry about Minal I will convince her
[1738.40] please forgive me
[1741.56] go away for God's sake forgive me I will do whatever you
[1745.92] say
[1753.44] but give me one chance I agree
[1757.80] I talk bad, very bad you can take
[1760.80] my life away
[1764.12] but I am not going to leave Manal  Don't separate me,
[1768.08] if I get separated from her I will die
[1777.55] [Music]
[1787.04] [Music]
[1795.80] Go and tell her that I
[1798.56] am not at home, the watchman has told them that
[1801.16] you
[1802.56] are at home, they want to meet
[1805.04] you, so you go and tell them that their
[1807.84] daughter does not want to meet him, okay, but
[1811.28] what have I told you, I don't want to meet
[1814.04] anyone, please go
[1815.89] [Music]
[1850.65] [Music]
[1862.92] Raman's wife is saying that you should go away from here, she does
[1865.08] not want to meet you, she does not
[1868.32] want to meet me, I am her father, oh brother, you
[1871.48] call her, she is angry, I will convince
[1874.60] her, what can I do
[1884.55] [Music]
[1889.16] I am sorry, I am feeling very sympathetic, I am
[1895.64] helpless seeing this,
[1898.16] first the wife left me and now the daughter has turned her back,
[1906.20] I thought I would keep Ram away from you,
[1909.16] but see, I did
[1912.40] not have to do anything, everything happened by god,
[1916.16] you do not feel pity for me,
[1918.84] but I feel a lot of pity for you, please
[1923.40] talk to Ram, please
[1925.32] forgive me, do not break this relationship with you,
[1929.60] after all you are her father, this relationship is what has to be
[1933.24] broken,
[1934.32] as far as I am concerned  And as far as her love is concerned, I
[1937.12] believed in
[1938.84] her, but under the roof where you live,
[1943.00] my daughter is not safe under any circumstances
[1948.04] I have to do anything to break this relationship, I have to go
[1949.96] to any extent, I will not
[1953.28] go, there will be no need for this Shajar will
[1957.20] hold her hand and push her out of this house
[1959.80] The way you ruined me,
[1963.12] you should also get some revenge for that
[1966.62] [Music]
[1990.24] That woman has snatched everything from me,
[1996.04] my daughter's heart is
[1998.68] filled with so much hatred for me that she does
[2002.08] not want to see my face, let alone meet me
[2004.56] Mehru died of this shock, she destroyed my house and
[2007.92] now she is planning to destroy Ran's house, she
[2014.76] cannot do anything Ran's house is a
[2018.48] very low woman,
[2021.24] she can do anything to take her revenge She
[2027.24] wants to take revenge from me for that betrayal which I did not do to her
[2029.12] And my daughter's
[2034.84] house will be ruined, only Allah knows her
[2047.72] You need not worry,
[2050.20] very soon Umar Hasan will be seen behind bars I have been
[2053.24] hearing you say these things for
[2055.24] months, this Rizwan sahab is not at all  He is a
[2058.24] useless man, it seems I will have to do something myself. Don't
[2064.16] talk like this about Rizwan sahab, he has done all his
[2066.52] work, right? He got all the fake
[2069.80] papers signed by him, after that
[2072.32] he has also shown it to Bakar sahab. Now Bakar
[2074.60] sahab has caught hold of those documents. Now the day
[2077.16] Bakar sahab sees him, he will get
[2080.24] Umar Hasan jailed in the embezzlement case. I do
[2084.00] n't know when this will happen. When will they
[2086.84] see, when will the report be made, when will the case be made, when will the
[2089.24] police come, when will he be arrested, when will he go to jail,
[2091.52] when will he be humiliated in front of Rameen and Shajar,
[2095.16] and when will I be able to remove him from my life. I don't
[2097.80] know
[2099.88] when it will happen. It will happen. Why are
[2104.24] you getting worried? Just don't take tension. I am here.
[2107.56] And remember one thing. I am also saying this in front of you today by
[2110.40] swearing that until Umar
[2113.48] Hasan goes behind the bars of the jail,
[2116.84] even your uncle will
[2118.76] not step on the seat of the plastic car
[2122.00] until this work is done. You will not
[2124.88] get the plastic car. Also remember that
[2129.76] seat
[2136.24] B means you will not
[2140.00] get one thing. Tell me honestly,
[2143.92] what is going on in your mind?
[2145.60] You are not going to forgive that cheater by getting influenced by Mamu's words,
[2152.12] why would I be influenced by Mamu's words,
[2155.24] I know how to take my own decisions and at
[2158.12] least I don't need your brother's advice,
[2162.12] but tell me what do you want to do,
[2165.96] Amma. Kamran is very smart, very clever, I have done whatever I had to do with
[2171.56] Umar.
[2174.72] His wife is no more in this world, now
[2176.96] I just have to remove Na from Shajar's life. I
[2179.20] think Kamran can help me in this task. To
[2184.64] ruin Umar,
[2188.60] you are playing with Minal's life. No
[2191.16] Amma, nothing like that will happen. You think for yourself, you
[2193.96] kept Kamran in captivity for so long, he was beaten, wooed, kept
[2195.92] thirsty, he even returned all the money
[2201.94] [Music]
[2203.08] and just kept apologizing and
[2206.12] asking for Minal, he did not sign the papers,
[2208.84] I think he really wants Minal
[2225.51] [Music]
